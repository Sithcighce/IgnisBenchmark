This  paper intends  to  provide a  comprehensive state-of-art  review  of  recent  progresses  and  to  formulate  per-
spectives  on  window-ejected  fire  plumes,  originating  from  under-ventilated  compartment  fires  (known  as
‘Regime I’ fires). Various external boundary conditions are considered, as they contribute to the fire and plume
dynamics,  and  as  such  affect  decisions  on  fire  prevention  and  firefighting.  Hence  this  is  an  important  fire
combustion topic of both fundamental and practical significance. After discussing the general fundamentals, the
paper focuses particularly on recent progresses on quantifying the ejected fire plume behavior: constrained by
the presence of walls; at sub-atmospheric pressure (for fires at high altitudes) and under complex flow conditions
caused by wind. Experiments, theoretical scaling analysis and basic models are reviewed. The key points cover
systematically: the compartment fire evolution (and hence criteria for flame ejection through the window); flame
interaction and merging behavior from two windows; air entrainment mechanisms and characteristic parameters
(flame structure/dimensions, temperature profile and heat flux) of window-ejected fire plumes. Meanwhile, the
limitations of present research and future challenges are also discussed.

1. Introduction

1.1. The phenomenon of window-ejected fire plumes from a compartment

With the development of society and the acceleration of urbaniza-
tion, the scale and volume of buildings are rising sharply [1–4]. At the
same  time,  the  occurrence  frequency  as  well  as  the  adverse  damage
impact and resulting losses of buildings due to fire, are relatively high
[5–30].  Building  fires  with  ejected  flames  and  fire  plumes  from  a
compartment  (room)  have  caused  major  threats  to  urban  safety,
particularly  when  they  ignite  a  combustible  facade,  leading  to  cata-
strophic losses of casualties and properties.

Window-ejected  fire  plumes  from  a  compartment  fire  also  pose  a
very relevant scientific problem in terms of building fire dynamics. In
that context, it is relevant to refer first to the review paper by Torero et
al. [31], where the compartment fire was revisited extensively, keeping
the interaction of fires and structures in mind. It is particularly impor-
tant to do so, because ejecting flames/fire plumes can occur from both
under-ventilated  and  well-ventilated  compartment  fires.  The  latter  is

referred to as ‘Regime II’ fires in the literature [31]. For such fires, there
are  large  ventilation  openings  (relative  to  the  fire  heat  release  rate
(HRR))  and  the  flow  field  and  heat  transfer  processes  are  in  general
complex  (in  particular  to  strongly  non-uniform  and  time  dependent
temperature and heat flux fields), so that no simple theoretical analysis
can  be  developed  for  ‘Regime  II’  fires.  The  momentum  is  always
important,  and  particularly  if  the  fire  source  is  close  to  a  ventilation
opening, or if there is a very strong ceiling jet, flames can eject from
openings. Yet, this is not the topic of study of the present paper. Rather,
the focus is solely on ‘Regime I’  fires [31]: these are under-ventilated
compartment fires with relatively small ventilation openings (relative
to the fire heat release rate (HRR)). As a consequence, relatively uniform
conditions  can  be  assumed  inside  the  compartment  and  momentum
within the enclosure is limited [31]. The static pressure difference over
the ventilation opening(s) determines the conditions and flow field: the
oxygen supply flow rate determined from the static pressure difference
over the ventilation opening; determines the HRR inside the compart-
ment  (and  hence,  for  a  certain  total  HRR,  also  the  excess  HRR).  The
compartment boundaries determine the heat losses per unit time from
the compartment. This combines with the ventilation opening into the

opening factor (see section 2), and a theoretical link between the tem-

factor can be established.

The ejected flames/fire plumes have certain morphological charac-
teristics, which essentially determine the thermal impact (temperature
profiles  and  heat  transfer  characteristics)  upon  the  surroundings,
including  the  building  facade,  which  can  contain  flammable  external
wall  materials  (e.g.,  [39–41]).  In  addition,  hot  smoke  and  poisonous
gases can be harmful, directly threatening people’s life safety. A review,
discussing ejected fire plumes from ‘Regime I’ fires, has been provided
by Delichatsios [42]. The basics have been laid out in [42] and is briefly
repeated  in  section  2.1.  However,  window-ejected  fire  plumes  are
strongly  affected  by  the  surrounding  boundary  conditions,  such  as

constraints by adjacent buildings and side wall structures [10,43], wind
[7,15,16,19,20,28,30,44]  and  sub-atmospheric  pressure/low-oxygen
environment  at  high  altitude  conditions  [45,46],  etc.).  This  will  be  a
substantial  part  of  the  present  paper  and  constitutes  its  novelty  and
added value, compared to, e.g., [42].

Summarizing,  it  is  considered  useful  to  provide  a  comprehensive
overview of the state-of-the-art of the research on the phenomenon of
the window-ejected fire plumes from a compartment and their evolu-
tions and related physics for various external boundary conditions. This
has  both  fundamental  (e.g.,  theoretical  scaling  analysis/basic  model
development) and practical significance (e.g., efficiency of fire preven-
tion and firefighting). As mentioned above, the paper focuses on ‘Regime
I’ fires only, in the absence of a general theory for ‘Regime II’ fires [31].

1.2. Overview of physical mechanisms for window-ejected fire plumes
from an under-ventilated compartment fire (‘Regime I’ fire)

As mentioned, the present paper is limited to ‘Regime I’ fires, where
the static pressure difference over the ventilation openings (which are
then relatively small in relation to the total HRR) determines the flow
field and oxygen supply (and hence the HRR inside the compartment,
see below), while the compartment boundaries determine the heat losses
per  unit  time  from  the  compartment,  in  which  uniform  temperature
conditions are assumed.

Fig.  1  shows  the  physical  processes/mechanisms  involved  in  a
window-ejected fire plume in such conditions. The fresh cool air enters
the compartment through the window and reacts with the fuel inside the
compartment.  The  unburned  hot  gases  eject  through  the  ventilation
opening and further react with fresh air outside the compartment. The
combustion inside the compartment is under-ventilated and as more and
more fuel gases are supplied and heat is released per unit time, a larger
window-ejected fire plume forms outside.

The fire turbulent combustion behavior inside the compartment is
determined by the oxygen supply. The conditions can be described by a
Global  Equivalence  Ratio  (GER)  concept,  as  thoroughly  reviewed  by
Pitts [47]. This GER (Φ) is determined by the fuel burning rate and the
incoming  air/oxygen  flow  rate,  the  latter  resulting  from  the  static
pressure  difference  over  the  ventilation  opening(s).  Therefore,  the
window dimensions (size, width, and height) are key, as well as the fuel
burning rate. If the latter is sufficiently high, i.e., so high that the oxygen
supply rate is insufficient for complete combustion inside the compart-
ment of all fuel released, this leads to flame ejection (Φ>1), expressed in
terms  of  an  excess  HRR.  This  also  defines  criteria  of  flame  ejection
through the window. As explained below, also the fire load, fire heat
release rate (HRR) and heat losses through the walls and windows have
an impact on the critical conditions. This has all been reported in the
review paper [42] and is briefly repeated in section 2.1 below.

In  general,  the  flame  structure/dimensions  and  the  temperature
profiles and heat fluxes (radiation and convection) are key. Hence, these

aspects  form  the  basic  constituents  for  the  fundamental  theory  of
window-ejected  fire  plume  dynamics.  They  are  influenced  by  the
outflow  characteristics  (due  to  the  static  pressure  difference  over  the
ventilation  openings),  by  the  buoyancy  effect  outside  and  by  other
external boundary conditions (e.g., restraints by the presence of walls, or
wind, or reduced atmospheric pressure). These are thus the fundamental
factors that, combined, determine the air entrainment into the ejected
fire  plumes,  and  hence  the  profiles  of  the  mentioned  characteristic
parameters.

The  window-ejected  fire  plume  has  the  following  basic  process/

features, forming its physical mechanisms, e.g., [48–66]:

(1)  Turbulent combustion behavior inside the compartment. This is
in  general  determined  by  the  HRR  (or  the  fuel  mass  loss  rate
(MLR,   ̇mf )) inside the compartment, which is affected by the fuel
load  and  the  oxygen  content  inside  the  compartment.  In  an
under-ventilated ‘Regime I’ fire, the HRR inside the compartment
is determined by the air supply, and the remainder of the HRR
(‘excess’ HRR) is outside the compartment, in the fire plume.
(2) Temperature  evolution  inside  the  compartment.  This  is  deter-
mined by the HRR inside the compartment and the heat losses per
unit time from the compartment (through the wall, as well as heat
convected  and  radiated  through  the  window).  Note  that  for  a
‘Regime II’ fire, it is meaningless to work with a single temper-
ature: the temperature field will be strongly non-uniform [31].
(3)  Position of the neutral plane at the ventilation opening. This is
determined by the ventilation opening size and position, as well
as the temperature inside the compartment. As this governs the
flow  into  and  out  of  the  compartment,  and  hence  the  oxygen
supply rate, this links with the critical HRR beyond which there is
flame  ejection,  with  under-ventilated  conditions  inside  the
compartment. There is globally a balance between mass flowing
out (ejected hot gas) and fresh air flowing in (ignoring the fuel
mass  flow  rate  and  potential  mass  accumulation  inside  the
compartment).

HRR  as  well  as  the  shape  and  dimensions  of  the  ventilation
opening(s). These profiles determine the radiation and convec-
tion heat fluxes from the window-ejected fire plumes along the
facade.

(7)  Heat  flux  along  the  facade  and  to  the  environment  (e.g.,  to
opposite walls), determined by the temperature/smoke profiles
of  the  fire  plume  and  flame  morphological  characteristics.  As
compared to a freely burning plume, the ejected plume attached
to  the  facade  involves  different  radiative  and  convective  heat
transfers,  as  the  thermal  boundary  and  flow  conditions  are
significantly different.

The  turbulent  combustion  inside  the  compartment  controls  the
temperature, inducing the flow at the window due to buoyancy (pres-
sure differences), further affecting the neutral plane at the window and
the critical HRR inside the compartment for flame ejection. The flow at
the  window  and  the  turbulent  combustion  inside  the  compartment
together determine  the excess (or convective) HRR, and thus the tur-
bulent combustion behavior of the ejected fire plume, and thus size of
the ejected flame, the temperature profiles and the resulting heat flux
distributions over the facade.

The  classical  theory  of  the  window-ejected  fire  plumes  from  a
‘Regime I’ compartment fire is mainly established for the ‘free’ boundary
condition [57,59,61], i.e., not considering the effect of wind or nearby
structures.  Several  reviews  [42,56,58,62,64–73]  report  on  such
window-ejected fire plumes, but mostly considering the similarity to fire
plume behavior that is controlled only by buoyancy (i.e., no wind [72,
73]).

The review of Delichatsios [42] summarizes the window-ejected fire
plumes for “free” boundaries (except for the facade). Hence, this is used
as starting point in section 2.1. Also configurations with sidewalls [74]
and two horizontal windows [75] have set the basis for work during the
past decade. However, external boundary conditions (see Fig. 2), which
can  be  quite  complex  in  urban  environment,  will  affect  the
window-ejected fire plumes significantly:

-  A ‘constrained’ boundary, such as a facing wall [61,76–78] or side
walls [10,43,79,80] (in Fig. 2 (a)), reduces the  entrainment of air
into the fire plume (and the smoke plume above), leading to larger
flame heights and increased temperatures. The fire plume can also be
pushed  closer  to  the  facade,  leading  to  strongly  intensified  heat
transfer (and thus, in case of a combustible facade, much faster fire
spread).

-  Horizontal barriers [81–100], such as balconies, eaves (in Fig. 2 (b)),
result  in  increased  entrainment  and  they  can  ‘block’  the  upward
momentum. This can significantly shorten the flame height, but can
obviously  lead  to  intense  heat  transfer  to  the  horizontal  barriers
themselves.

-  Sub-atmospheric pressure at high altitudes (such as the Lhasa-Tibet
plateau, where atmospheric pressure is as low as 64 kPa, in Fig. 2
(c)) [45,46,101–104]. This affects the oxygen concentration in the
air  (and  hence  the  combustion  processed  inside  the  compartment
and in the fire plume), as well as the buoyancy force, due to reduced
mass density of environment air. This also modifies the entrainment
process.

-  Complex flow conditions due to wind (facing wind, sideward wind,
back-roof  wind,  in  Fig.  2  (d))  [7,15,16,19,20,28,30,44].  The
wind-induced momentum interacts with the buoyancy-induced mo-
mentum and can significantly alter the flame shape and position. The
wind can also reduce the flame temperature, but it can also push the
fire plume closer to the facade (which in turn leads to increased heat
transfer).  Moreover,  wind  will  affect  the  flow  rates  through  the
ventilation  opening(s):  the  pressure  difference  is  no  longer  solely
determined by the static pressure difference as induced by the tem-
perature  inside  the  compartment.  As  a  result,  the  neutral  plane

height, and as such the air flow rate and the critical HRR for flame
ejection, will change significantly.

The  discussion  of  the  impact  of  the  above-mentioned  points  on
window-ejected  fire  plumes  from  a  ‘Regime  I’  compartment  fire  con-
stitutes important new features, of which the present paper provides a
review of the state-of-the-art and some perspectives for future research.

1.3. Structure of this review

The structure of this review is as follows. First, the basic phenomena
of window-ejected fire plumes from a ‘Regime I’ compartment fire are
described and the physical mechanisms are summarized. The necessary
basic knowledge/classical models of compartment fires and the critical
state of flame ejection through the window, air entrainment physics and
characteristic parameters of the window-ejected fire plumes are intro-
duced as a basis for further discussion of its behavior under different
boundary  conditions.  Immediately  thereafter,  a  summary  of  window-
ejected fire plumes is provided for various aspects, including: (1) crit-
ical  state/criteria  of  flames  ejected  through  the  window,  (2)  air
entrainment  physics  and  characteristic  parameters,  (3)  interaction
mechanism  and  flames  merging  from  two  windows  (in  parallel  hori-
zontally at the same floor, or in vertically lower-upper floors), (4) fire
behavior  under  external  wall  constraint  boundary  conditions,  (5)  fire
behavior  under  sub-atmospheric  pressure,  (6)  fire  behavior  under
external wind.

For each condition, detailed discussions and summaries are carried
out on the characteristics of the window-ejected fire plumes, reviewing
experiments, theoretical scaling analyses and basic models. Finally, the
limitations of present state-of-the-art research and future challenges are
discussed to provide a research perspective on this important topic.

2. ‘Regime I’ compartment fire and critical HRR for flame
ejection through window

As mentioned in the introduction, the window-ejected fire plume is
considered  as  originating  from  a  ‘Regime  I’  (under-ventilated)
compartment  fire.  Therefore,  this  section  briefly  reviews  the  funda-
mental knowledge of the compartment fire dynamics in these circum-
stances,  including  the  critical  state  of  flame  ejection  through  the
window. It lays the groundwork for the more detailed discussion of the
topics in the next sections of this review paper.

2.1. Flame ejection through window as determined by the compartment
fire dynamics

Combustion behavior and flow dynamics inside a compartment with
a  window  is  a  fundamental  turbulent  combustion  problem  and  also
practically  one  of  the  most  classic  scenarios  in  research  on  fire  com-
bustion dynamics. Here, the focus is on the compartment fire dynamics
aspects  that  determine  the  flame  ejection  through  the  ventilation
opening (window), in the context for ‘Regime I’ fires, where the static
pressure difference over the ventilation opening is sufficient to describe
the entire dynamics, as described in the introduction. ‘Regime II’ fires
are not considered here, acknowledging that there is no universal theory
for these fires [31].

During all stages of the compartment fire, the mass flow rates of the
inflowing air and the outflowing hot gases are almost equal (differing
only  by  the  fuel  mass  MLR  and  the  mass  accumulation  inside  the
compartment, which are often negligible). It is well-known that the fire
dynamics inside the compartment can be characterized as either over-
ventilated  or  under-ventilated  [56,58,60,62,64–66].  At  the  initial
stage  of  the  combustion/fire  evolution  inside  a  compartment,  the
amount  of  released  combustible  gas  (“fuel  supply”)  inside  the
compartment is relatively small, and there is enough oxygen (controlled
by the fuel MLR) inside the compartment to support the combustion: the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience94(2023)1010396

X. Sun et al.

combustion is well-ventilated (oxygen-rich). The burning rate of com-
bustibles at this stage is mainly controlled by the fuel MLR (  ̇mf ). This
stage  is  often  referred  to  as  the  fuel-controlled  stage  (over-ventilated
stage, oxygen-rich). During this stage, the upper hot gas and the lower
cool air are well stratified with a clear interface, Fig. 1 (a). The tem-
peratures of the hot gas upper layer and the cool air bottom layer are
remarkably different. Based on this fundamental phenomenon and flow
condition,  the  well-known  classical  two-layer  compartment  fire  zone
model  [56,58,60,62,64–66]  was  developed,  which  has  been  studied
extensively and widely applied to predict the temperatures of the cool
air bottom layer and the hot gas upper layer, as well as their interface
height  above  the  floor  in  a  compartment  fire  (e.g.,  [56,58,60,62,
64–66]).

With the growing of the fire inside the compartment, more and more
combustible gases are supplied, leading to increased flow rates of both
the outflow of hot gases and the inflow of fresh air through the window.
The flow turbulence inside the compartment, and thus the mixing of the
cool air with the hot gas at their interface, is enhanced, which finally
results  in  the  well-mixed  under-ventilated  combustion  conditions,  as
shown in Fig. 1 (b) (or Fig. 1 (a), assuming the smoke fills the entire
compartment, rather than the upper part only). At this stage, the strat-
ification (two-layer configuration) is lost and the temperature is often
assumed  uniform  inside  the  compartment.  Meanwhile,  the  hot  fuel
cannot be burnt completely inside the compartment due to insufficient
supply  of  oxygen  (fuel-rich  and  oxygen-lean).  It  will  therefore  eject
through the upper part of the window. The high-temperature unburned
fuel will further react with the fresh air outside, resulting in an external
combustion  phenomenon,  i.e.,  flame  ejection  through  the  window,
developing along the facade above.

In under-ventilated conditions, the ventilation opening (window) is
key to the combustion inside the compartment. Research on compart-
ment fires for under-ventilated conditions started from the 1950s [105,
106]. The burning rate of the wood stack (crib) inside compartments of
various  scales  (full-scale  and  small-scale)  for  under-ventilated  condi-
tions can be represented by the following formulas [105,106]:

Here,   ̇mf  is the mass burning rate of the wood crib, A is area of the
window, H is height of the window. This equation correlates the burning
rate to the dimension of the window only, which is of great significance
for  describing  the  fire  behavior  inside  the  compartment.  In  further
research  by  other  scholars  [53,107–112],  it  has  been  found  that  the
factor (A
) in the formula can be used as an essential parameter to
characterize the fire behavior inside the compartment, i.e., ventilation
,  while  the  constant  coefficient  of  the  Eq.  (1)  (k0=0.09
factor,  A
kg⋅s-1⋅m-5/2,  or  k0=5.5  kg⋅min-1⋅m-5/2)  is  related  to  the  type  of  fuel
(combustibles), ranging from 5.5 to 9 kg⋅min-1⋅m-5/2 [53,107–112].

Eq. (3) is the central equation, showing that for a given geometry of
the ventilation opening, the only physical term driving the flow (and
thus inflow and outflow through the ventilation opening) is the density
ratio (or, equivalently, temperature ratio). According to a large amount
of  experimental data,  the  average value  of the  square  root  of  density
(Eq. (3)) is about 0.2 and nearly constant for gas temperatures that are
twice the ambient temperature or higher [52,53]. Therefore, it can be
observed that the fresh air mass flow rate entering the compartment is
actually only proportional to the ventilation factor,   ̇ma~A
. The mass

Since  then,  many  scholars  (e.g.,  [57,59,66,76,114–118])  have  ob-
tained  experimental  results  confirming  the  above  expressions,  using
compartments and windows with various dimensions.

√

For the compartment fire, the opening factor is another important
parameter, introduced by Thomas [110]. This is the ratio of the venti-
lation  factor  to  the  total  surface  area  of  the  exposed  walls  of  the
/AT. From
compartment, excluding ventilation openings (window): A
the perspective of energy conservation, the opening factor reflects the
ratio of the heat generated by the combustion inside the compartment
(heat  released)  to  the  amount  of  heat  lost  through  the  wall  of  the
compartment per unit time (heat loss). This determines the temperature
rise inside the compartment [54–56,58,62,64–66,119–125]. It will be
explained  below  how  this  quantity  appears  in  basic  models  for
window-ejected fire plumes from the compartment.

The HRR (

 ̇
Q) is one of the most essential factors in characterizing the
compartment  fire.  In  under-ventilated,  the  HRR  is  determined  by  the
oxygen supply rate through the ventilation openings (windows here) of
the  compartment.  The  mass  flow  rate  of  fresh  air  entering  the
compartment, Eq. (4) [52,53], is to be multiplied with the HRR per unit
air supplied (ΔHox) [126]:

Eq. (1) relates to Bernoulli’s equation in fluid mechanics, applied to
the buoyancy-driven model of compartment fires (‘Regime I’ fires), ac-
counting for the flow balance due to the fire-induced pressure difference
(caused by the temperature rise or, equivalently, by buoyancy) as shown
in Fig. 1 [52,53]. Babrauskas [52,53] deduced the flow rates through the
window  as  induced  by  the  buoyancy.  Assuming  the  gas  temperature
inside the compartment (Tg) uniform (well-mixed), the position of the
pressure neutral plane height above the bottom of the window (Hn, a
reference  height  with  theoretically  no  relative  flow  of  gas,  where  ΔP
(z=Hn)=0),  is  found  to  be  determined  solely  by  the  ratio  of  the  tem-
peratures  inside  and  outside  of  the  compartment  [52,53]  (for  the
detailed derivations refer to [56,58,60,62,64–66,113]):

It should be noted that this value is the maximum HRR inside the

2.2. Criteria of flame ejection through window from a compartment

Flame ejection is assumed to occur when the GER exceeds unity, i.e.,
when there is too little oxygen flowing into the compartment per unit
time  to  be  able  to  burn  the  fuel,  released  at  the  given  burning  rate.
Another way of stating this, is that the HRR as obtained from Eq. (5)
would  exceed  the  HRR  as  obtained  from  Eq.  (6).  Therefore,  the
 ̇
Qinside=1500AH1/2 kW (Eq. (6)) is often used as critical HRR
expression
for  flame  ejection:  beyond  this  HRR,  a  window-ejected  fire  plume  is
assumed i.e.,

Qinside=1500AH1/2 kW.

 ̇
Qcritical=  ̇

It is noted, though, that a transitional phenomenon, with intermit-
tent flame ejection behavior, was observed by Gottuk et al. [128]. It was

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience94(2023)1010397

X. Sun et al.

established  that  external  burning  has  three  regimes:  (1)  intermittent
flashes;  (2)  bursts  lasting  for  only  a  few  seconds;  and  (3)  sustained
external burning. Later, the overall combustion efficiency was measured
in the context of the window-ejected fire plumes from a compartment
[129],  showing that it is  below 100% for gaseous fuel (propane) and
solid fuels (wood crib, PMMA and polyurethane flexible foam), which
indicates that an amount of fuel is ejected through the window without
burning. Later, a definite difference between the theoretical HRR and
the  actual  HRR  was  observed  when  the  HRR  reached  values  around
1500A
[59].  There  is  a  transition  stage,  where  the  fuel  is  incom-
pletely consumed, before continuous external burning is sustained [59,
129].

More  recently,  a  detailed  investigation  on  the  transition  stage  of
intermittent flame ejection has been reported [130]. Fig. 3 shows the
three different regimes of flame ejection, i.e., the internal combustion,
intermittent flame ejection and continuous external flame. A time-based
probability index P of flame occurrence outside the window (compart-
ment), ranging from 0 to 1, was defined to characterize the transition
conditions  of  the  different  regimes  of  flame  ejection,  i.e.,  the  lower
critical HRR (corresponding to the beginning of the transition) and the
upper  critical  HRR  (corresponding  to  the  end  of  the  transition  with
continuous  flaming  outside).  The  probability  of  flame  occurrence
(ejection) outside the compartment (P) should relate to the fuel supply

rate (excess unburned fuel outside, or excess HRR outside,
ex), together
with the competition of heat generated per unit time by combustion and
heat losses per unit time to compartment walls and through ventilation
openings (like windows), by the following expression (“fcn” is abbrevi-

Furthermore,  the  criteria  for  flame  ejection  and  the  intermittent
probability were found to be influenced by the window type [132–134]
(e.g., a casement window [133], a circular window [132] or triangular
windows  [134]),  external  wind  conditions [38,135,136] (facing  wind
normal  to  the  window  [38,135]),  sub-atmospheric  pressure  at  a  high
altitude as well as the coupling effect between the side wall and facing
wind [137]. It was also found that the critical HRR for flame ejection
was determined by the window opening angle for the casement window
[134],  radius  of  circular  window  [132],  height  and  base  width  of
triangular window (H, B) [134] as well as the external wind speed [38,
135,136].  The  criteria  of  flame  ejection  through  the  window  from  a
compartment for various conditions are summarized in Table 1.

In  summary,  the  ventilation  factor  and  opening  factor  are  key
characteristic  parameters,  determining  the  fire  HRR  and  temperature
inside the compartment, the flow conditions at the window (through the
static pressure difference there) and the critical HRR beyond which the
fire plume ejects through the window. Intermittent flame ejection has
been observed around this critical HRR value.

3. Air entrainment physics and characteristic parameters of
window-ejected fire plumes from a compartment fire

3.1. Outflow physics - key parameters

After the ejection of flames through the window, the outflow physics
and the induced air entrainment determine the further development of
the  fire  plume.  The  outflow  condition  is  determined  by  ventilation
opening(s)  and  the  fire  inside  the  compartment.  As  explained  in  the
previous  section,  together  they  determine  the  temperature  inside  the
compartment, hence the static pressure difference over the ventilation
opening(s) and the position of the neutral plane height, hence the mass
flow rate of incoming oxygen, hence the excess HRR.

The key ‘input’  parameters to characterize the ejected fire plumes,

describing the ‘source’ of the fire plumes, are:

- Characteristic length scales, related to the dimensions of the venti-
lation opening(s), determining the horizonal dimensions at the bot-
tom of the fire plume (section 3.2.1), and hence strongly affecting the
entrainment into the fire plume (through its side area).

-  The  temperature  inside  the  compartment  (section  3.2.2),  which,
together  with  the  outflow  of  hot gases,  determines  the  convective
heat flux emerging from the compartment, and hence entering the
fire plume.

-  The excess HRR, determining the amount of combustion outside the

compartment, in the fire plume.

The  ‘output’  parameters  are  the  ‘shape’  of  the  ejected  fire  plume
(flame  heigh/depth/width),  the  temperature  profile  in  the  fire  plume
and the heat flux over the facade. These are discussed in section 3.3.

The overall physics can be summarized as follows. The excess hot
unburned gas ejects horizontally through the upper part of the window
with high temperature/heat flux. It reacts with the ambient fresh air and
moves upward due to the buoyancy provided by the flame itself. The
turbulent air entrainment at the interface (envelope of the plume) be-
tween the outside hot plume and the surrounding cold air results in mass
exchange and mixing, and controls the flame diffusive combustion and
characteristic scale (shape and size), as well as the profile of the char-
acteristic parameters (temperature, heat flux/radiation). Thus, the air
entrainment  is  the  key  mechanism  in  controlling  window-ejected  fire
plume’s  morphological  characteristics  along  the  facade,  which  de-
termines its thermal impact to upper floors as well as surroundings, i.e.,
adjacent/nearby buildings.

3.2.1. Length scales for air entrainment into the ejected fire plume

Characteristic length scales based on the window (opening)/source
dimensions have been proposed to describe the air entrainment of the
window-ejected fire plumes along the facade. The length scale r0  was
proposed by Yokoi [48,138], which represents the equivalence radius of
a circle with half the area of the window to describe the profile of axis
(trajectory) temperature and velocity for various window dimensions.
The neutral plane was assumed at the center of the window, Hn=0.5H. It
was proposed that:

More  recently,  a  rectangular-source  theory  was  proposed  [57,59,
116] including two length scales to describe the characteristic param-
eters of the fire plume along the facade as shown in Fig. 5. In this theory,
the flame can be deemed as produced by a horizontal rectangular fire
source  at  the  neutral  plane  (Hn=0.4H)  [56,58,60,62,64–66]  of  the
window. This rectangular-source has two basic length scales determined
by  the  window  dimensions:  l1=(AH1/2)2/5,  parallel  to  the  window;
l2=(AH2)1/4, normal to the window.

For  the  characteristic  scale  l1=(AH1/2)2/5,  it  is  assumed  that  the
mass  flow  rate  of  the  fresh  air  flowing  into  the  compartment  (  ̇ma)  is

The term on the RHS (Right Hand Side) of Eq. (13) is similar to the
Zukoski’s dimensionless HRR [140]. This indicates that an appropriate
length scale (l1) for under-ventilated compartment fires relates to the
convective  heat  flow,  which  can  also  be  used  to  normalize  the  flame
height of the ejected fire plume (i.e., Zf /l1).

The characteristic scale l2=(AH2)1/4 represents the horizontal length
after which the flow turns to be vertical from horizontal. This can be
determined from the competition of momentum flux (M0≈  ̇mgvg) and the
buoyancy flux (J0≈  ̇mgΔTg/T∞g) at the window:

l2 ≈

(M0/ρ∞)3/4
(J0/ρ∞)1/2

=

)1/4

(14)

This  characteristic  parameter  represents  the  flame  characteristic

depth (normal to the facade).

Moreover, another characteristic scale, l3∝(AH4/3)3/10 [61] in Fig. 5,
is also proposed to represent the trajectory length after which the flames
turns from horizontal to vertical due to buoyancy, determined by the
competition of momentum and buoyancy in the vicinity of the window.
The above characteristic length scales are summarized in Table 2.
They have been widely used in similarity analysis and modeling of the
window-ejected fire plume parameters and profiles, such as the flame
height, temperature and heat flux profile.

3.2.2. Temperature inside fire compartment

Extensive research has been conducted on the temperature inside fire
compartments.  The  prediction  of  temperature  inside  a  post-flashover
fire  compartment  was  first  developed  by  Babrauskas  [53,120].  Then
the well-known M-Q-H equation [54], a dimensionless correlation for
gas temperature rise based on energy conservation, was developed from
a series of pool fire tests inside a compartment [54] as well as previous
works [142–149] considering various compartment scales, window di-
mensions and the thermophysical characteristics of the wall material.
The M-Q-H equation was further modified considering the conditions of
wall  fires  and  corner  fires  [122–124,150,151].  The  ventilation  effect
was also discussed, and models for temperature inside the compartment

for forced ventilation [122–124,151] were proposed. Other temperature
models  were  proposed  by  Matsuyama  et  al.  [152]
for  an
under-ventilated compartment fire. Later in [153], the maximum tem-
perature for compartment fires was developed on the basis of the inverse
of opening factor (Ω=AT/A
) [153]. A comprehensive correlation for
the  temperature  evolution  inside  the  compartment  was  developed  in
[125], considering the average heat flux imposed on the boundary as
well  as  heat  losses  through  the  boundary  of  the  compartment.  The
models for temperature inside the compartment of various scales were
revisited in [72,73,124,154–157]. Table 3 provides a summary.

Later on, reduced-scale experiments were carried out to investigate
the  temperature  inside  the  compartment  for  6  different  window  di-
mensions [131]. Considering the energy balance and assuming the ra-
diation by the ejected flame to be less important, the gas temperature
rise inside the compartment can be expressed as:

where the opening factor A

[54–56,58,60,62,64–66,119–125].  Meanwhile,  for  the  flame  ejection
from  two  parallel  windows,  the  temperature  inside  is  also  consistent
with the results of [131], and independent of the separation distance of
windows [75]. Furthermore, the temperature inside the compartment
with a special window shape (circular and triangular) was examined in
[132,134]. The results show that: (1) for the compartment fire with a
circular  window  [132],  the  temperature  inside  the  compartment  first
increases  and  then  slightly  decreases  for  relatively  smaller  window
(diameter:  0.15  m),  while  it  increases  and  then  remains  constant  for
relatively larger window (diameters: 0.20 m and 0.25 m) with increasing
HRR; (2) for the compartment with triangular window [134], the tem-
perature  inside  the  compartment  can  be  predicted  from  combining  a
newly defined ventilation factor (0.5BH3/2) with Eq. (15).

3.3. Characteristic ‘output’ parameters of window-ejected fire plumes

The characteristic parameters of window-ejected fire plumes from a
compartment include flame shape (height, width, depth), temperatures,
heat fluxes over the facade, and radiation emission.

3.3.1. Flame height of the ejected fire plumes

Due to the air entrainment restriction by the building’s facade and
the outflow initial horizontal momentum, the ejected flame is essentially
different from a free fire plume. The flame height is the most crucial
morphological parameter of the fire plume [48,51,57,59,81,116,138,34,
158–162]. It is defined as the vertical location at which all the excess
unburned fuel is consumed by the air entrained into the flame envelope.
Physically, it determines the critical condition of how far the flame can
touch combustible material above the window. It is also very strongly
related to heat fluxes and temperatures, which determine the fire spread
in case of a combustible facade.

◦

√

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
WH/2π

The flame height has received focused research studies [48,51,57,59,
81,116,118,38,137,138,153,34,158–174].  In  early  studies,  the  flame
height (or flame tip) was measured by the position where ΔTz=500
C
◦
(Seigel used 540
C as the flame tip [175]). The characteristic length r0
(r0 =
. Eq. (12)) was used as a characteristic scale to normalize
the flame height of the ejected fire plumes. Later, the flame height (Zf)
was measured based on a large-scale compartment fire (compartment
scale:  2.4  m×3.6  m×2.4  m)  in  [81].  The  experimental  data  of  the
measured flame height in Oleszkiewicz’s experiments and the theoret-
ical  value  of  flame  height  calculated  based  on  Yokoi’s  temperature
profile model [48,138] were compared by Quintiere et al. [161]. In his

 ̇
Qinside) and  the  HRR  outside of  the
the  HRR inside  the  compartment  (
 ̇
compartment  (or  excess  HRR,
Qex).  As  a  result,  the  calculated  flame
height is higher than the measured values.

Q=  ̇
 ̇

In [158–160], the flame height (calculated from the bottom of the
window) was determined with a cubic compartment (length scale, Lc),
with one side wall of the compartment entirely opened (a window with
Lc=W=H). It is important to note that the expressions of [158–160] in
Table 4 do not apply to cases where there is a vertical wall/facade above
the window (or compartment).

In [153], the correlation from Webster and Thomas et al. data was
modified by using the width of the window (W) and the Yokoi temper-
ature profile model [48,138]. This was applied in [177].

In [162,166], the flame tip height, normalized by the width of the
window (Zf /W), was plotted as a power function of dimensionless heat

The most recent advancement was reported in [57,59,116], where a
rectangular-source  theory  was  developed  to  characterize  the  flame

[172,173]  and  Lu  et  al.  [174]  are  also  included  herein.  It  can  be
concluded that: (1) the flame heights for different fuels correlate well
and depend only on the HRR, independent of the stoichiometry; (2) the
flame height is a function of 2/3 power and 2/5 power of HRR for the
two-dimensional  (“plane  wall  fire”)  and  three-dimensional  fires,

respectively,  i.e.,  for
sponding  to  a  two-dimensional  fire  plume  (similar  to  “line  source
plume”), and the entrainment occurs mostly from the front direction; for

to  a
three-dimensional  fire  plume  (“half  axi-symmetric”),  and  the  air
entrainment occurs from both the front and the sides of the spill plume.

[164],  showing  that  this  correlation  can  be  used  to  estimate  flame
heights for all small- [59,118,137,162, 166], medium- [168,172–174],
and large-scale (full-scale) [81,161,163–165] experiments, and also the
CFD simulation [170] results confirm this model/theory. It’s noted that
the prediction errors were lower than 25% when the correlations are
applied  to  various  scale  compartments  (including  full-scale  compart-
ment, length×width×height, 3.6 m×2.4 m×2.4 m).

In addition, a series of experiments were carried out to investigate
the  ejected  flame  height  for  different  situations  and  boundary  condi-
tions, such as with a facing wall [102,178], barriers above the window
[99],  side  walls  [79,179,180],  ambient  pressure  [102],  merging
behavior for double windows [75], and external wind conditions [38,

It  should  be  noted  that  the  above  works  are  based  on  under-
ventilated  compartment  fire  conditions.  The  transitional  behavior  of
under-ventilated  compartment  fires  with  increasing  fuel  supply  was

reported  recently  [139]:  the  temperature  inside  the  compartment
experienced a sudden drop (flame extinction inside the compartment),
associated with a sudden increase of flame height outside the window
(compartment),  posing  a  more  severe  impact  on  the  facade.  A  new
non-dimensional model has been proposed to correlate the facade flame
height at the transitional state of under-ventilated compartment fires,
with  a  2/3  power  dependence  (typically  found  for  “plane  wall  fires”

The flame height from special windows (such as circular windows
[132],  triangular  windows  [134])  has  been  investigated  [132,134],
deducing the excess HRR from Bernoulli’s flow equation. An appropriate
ventilation factor for these special windows was defined to describe the
air mass inflow rate for under-ventilated conditions. Non-dimensional
correlations were developed to characterize these flame heights of the
ejected fire plumes normalized by the characteristic length of the win-
dows (Zf /d, Zf /Lt, where d is the diameter of circular window [132], and

3.3.2. Flame depth (normal to the facade) and flame width (parallel to the
facade)

In contrast to the extensive works on the ejected flame height, only
limited quantitative information has been reported on the ejected fire
plume flame width (Wf) and depth (Df), which are also important flame
characteristics. In [153] it was suggested that the maximum width of the
ejected flame was similar to the width of the window, i.e., Wf=W. The
standard  approach  was  described  in  Eurocode  1  [182]  according  to
[164]  (summarized  in  Table  5  later).  A  triangular  flame  shape  was
proposed  in  [164]  to  estimate  the  flame  depth,  assuming  a  linear
decrease in depth from the top of the window to the tip of the flame
(where the flame depth is set to be zero). However, for a narrow window
(W<H), the width of the flame ejected through the narrow window is
larger than the width of the window [183]. Full-scale experimental re-
sults suggested that the width of the plume is up to 0.5 m wider than the
width of the window [184–187].

3.3.3. Temperature evolution in ejected fire plumes

Started  by  Yokoi  [48,138],  the  vertical  temperature profile of  fire
plumes along the facade from a compartment fire has been investigated
extensively over the past decades. Using a reduced-scale compartment of
0.4  m  (Length)×0.4  m  (Width)×0.2  m  (Height)  with  different  window
(opening) dimensions (size), a classical model for the vertical temper-
ature profile along the axis (trajectory) of fire plume ejected from win-
dows (of various scale) was proposed [48,138], as shown in Fig. 8.

(length-
×width×height: 0.5 m×0.5 m×0.5 m, 1.0 m×0.5 m×1.0 m, 1.5 m×0.5
m×0.5 m) were carried out to investigate the flame width for relatively
small windows (l1/Zf<0.33) [57]. It was found that the length scale l1
(defined in Fig. 5, parallel to the facade) can be used to characterize the
maximum flame width (Wf,max) (see Table 6). In [188] the flame width
and depth were further investigated using a 0.8 m cubic compartment.
Fig. 7 shows the definition of the ejected fire plume flame (maximum)
depth (Df,max) and width (Wf,max). It was found that the maximum flame
width is larger than the flame depth, and both increase with HRR. The
maximum flame width correlated well with characteristic length scale
l1  [=(AH1/2)2/5],  normalized  by  the  flame  height,
i.e.,  l1/Zf
(l1/Zf>0.33). Meanwhile, the maximum flame depth for all conditions
was  found  to  correlate  well  with  characteristic  length  scale  l2
[=(AH2)1/4], normalized by the flame height (l2/Zf) (see Table 5).

The models for window-ejected fire plume flame depth and width are

summarized in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.

The characteristic length scale was set as r0 (Eq. (12)), corresponding
to an equivalence radius with half the area of the window. Then, the

(z/r0),  z  is  the  vertical  distance  from  half  the  height  of  the  window)
could  be  divided  into  a  continuous  flame  region  (for  z/r0<1.5),  an
intermittent  flame  region  (for  z/r0  ranging  from  1.5  to  10),  and  a
buoyant  (smoke)  plume  region  (for  z/r0>10).  Later,  a  virtual  source
origin  (Δz)  was  introduced  to  modify  Yokoi’s  correlation  and  the
dimensionless vertical temperature Θ would be a function of (z+Δz)/r0
[34]. Noguchi et al. [33] further developed a modified correlation based
on the relative position of the neutral plane at the window (x = Hn /H =
1 /[1 + 1.04(Tg/T∞)1/3])  as  well  as  the  proposed  new  length  scale

characteristic  length  scale  l1=(AH1/2)2/5  is  more  appropriate  for  the
correlation of the vertical temperature evolution, and the dimensionless

Besides, there are also research studies quantifying the lateral tem-

where,  ΔTmax  is  the  maximum  temperature  rise  above  the  ambient
(ΔTmax=Tmax–T∞), and the correlation coefficient β is determined by the
window aspect ratio (H/W). Later, such a Gaussian function was further
applied  to  characterize  the  lateral  temperature  profile  of  ejected  fire
plumes  without  the  bounding  of  a  facade  wall  (fire  issued  from  the
window of a top storey without the facade wall effect) [192].

It is noted that the temperature profile of ejected fire plumes along
the facade is strongly effected by external boundary conditions, such as a
(sloping)  facing wall [193], side  walls beside  the window  [194], and
ambient wind conditions [195,196].

3.3.4. Heat flux over the facade and radiation emission of window-ejected
fire plumes

The heat flux, signifying the thermal impact from a window-ejected
fire plume upon the building facade, is a crucial parameter determining
the fire spread over the facade (if combustible materials are used) [26,
197–205].  The  heat  flux  includes  both  convection  and  radiation.  In
1960, the fire spread from a fire building to an adjacent one was firstly
discussed in [197] by Law as a pioneer, analyzing the thermal radiation
impact for various building separation distances. Later, the radiation on
the facade, related to the HRR, was calculated in [206]. Measured heat
fluxes over the facade were reported in [81,163,164], and the effects of
the side walls and horizontal barrier on the heat flux were qualitatively
described.  A  non-dimensional  analysis  to  examine  heat  transfer  from
flames to vertical surfaces was proposed in [161].

In [207], the radiation intensity of the ejected flame from the win-
dow  was  divided  into  different regions,  namely the  continuous  flame
region and the intermittent flame region. The total radiation emission
(  ̇qtotal) could be expressed as:   ̇qtotal
i , where Fc and Fi
are the view factor from the continuous and intermittent flame zone, ε is
the  emissivity,  Tc  and  Ti  are  the  continuous  flame  temperature  and
intermittent flame temperature respectively.

where z is the vertical height above the neutral plane of the window.
Later on, the new characteristic length scales, l1 and l2, were proposed
to modify heat flux models upon the facade [57,59,61,211]. To improve
the correlation, an empirical correction factor, reflecting the difference
of window dimensions has also been introduced as e0.6(H/l1)

been further verified in [104,118,212] as shown in Fig. 10.

Besides, it should be also noted that the heat flux upon the building

4. Interaction mechanism and flame merging of ejected fire
plumes from two windows

√

̅̅̅̅
H

As explained above, for an under-ventilated compartment fire, the
flame  ejection  from  a  single  compartment  with  only  one  (vertical)
window  is  controlled  by  the  window  conditions  (window  ventilation
factor, A
). However, usually there is more than one window in a real
building  and  this  can  affect  the  ventilation  conditions  inside  a
compartment, as well as the flames outside. Multiple windows can be
arranged in horizontal (‘parallel’) and vertical groups. Currently some
research  studies  [75,214,215]  are  focusing  on  the  interaction  mecha-
nism  and  flame  merging  of  such  window-ejected  fire  plumes  and
simplified models are discussed in this section.

It  was  suggested  in  [208]  that  the  radiant  heat  flux  outside  the
compartment contains two parts, namely the radiant heat flux from the
hot gas and the radiation emission from the ejected flame. The influence
of the window dimension on the radiation received at the opposite wall
from the facade fire plume was studied in [209], showing that when the
window height is much larger than the window width (H>W), the ra-
diation on the opposite wall is mainly dependent on the external flame
above the window.

In  recent  years,  regarding  the  window  width  as  a  characteristic
′′
length scale, the profile of heat flux (  ̇q
, heat flux of the centreline at the
distance z above the window) along the facade was determined by the

4.1. Physical phenomena and modeling of flame interaction and merging
behavior

Flame  interaction  and  merging  behavior  is  mostly  observed  in
combustion of “group fires” [216–218], commonly observed in a forest,
or an urban city with a large number of ancient wooden buildings in the
presence of ambient wind, leading to catastrophic loss in human lives
and properties. The spatial distance between fire sources and the flame
height variation with fire source distances are two key parameters that
have drawn extensive attention in the last decades. In the event of group
fires, if the separation distances of the fire sources are large enough, the
fire plumes are independent of each other. However, if the separation
distance  of  fire  sources  reduces,  the  interaction  of  flames  increases
gradually. More precisely, there is more limited air entrainment in be-
tween  the  fire  sources  and  the  flow  makes  the  flame  stretch  and  tilt.
When the distance between the fire source edges is reduced to a critical
distance, the flames of each fire source start to get in contact with each
other and eventually they merge. Finally, when the separation distance
is  reduced  to  0,  the  combustion  behavior  of  multi-fire  sources  is  just
similar to a single combined fire source again.

and width of the rectangular fire source respectively, S is the separation
between the two fuel beds. Later, the critical distance for flame merging
was examined based on several experiments of square gas burners fires
, valid for 1<L/W<10. Further research,
matrix [220]:  S
W
based on a series of reduced-scale experiments, showed that the critical
distance of flame merging depends on the total HRR (or the number of
burners) [217]. When the HRR of each burner remains very small (e.g.,
the  non-dimensional  HRR  is  0.75  for  each  burner  in  the  case  of  5×5
burners),  the  flames  are  hardly  merging,  regardless  of  how  many
burners are used, and for any separation distance between the burners. A
simplified  model  was  proposed  for  the  critical  distance  between  the
source centers (D): D/Lm≈0.29~0.34 by Liu [221] and Delichatsios et al.
[222]

The  flame  height  at  the  occurrence  of  flame  merging  for  group
sources  has  also  been  identified  as  a  crucial  characteristic  parameter
[223]. Flame tilting is determined by air entrainment [223]. When the
fire sources are gathered, the flame shape/structure changes. The flame
height (Lm) when merging, normalized by the independent flame height
(L*) from a single fire source, was proposed as a function of fire source
number (n), fire dimension (D), distance between fire source edge (S)
and HRR (

4.2. Flame interaction and merging characteristics from two parallel
windows

Flame  interaction  and  merging  from  two  or  more  windows  is  an
interesting  fundamental  and  practical  phenomenon  [75,214]  in
window-ejected  fire  plumes  from  a  compartment.  Similar  to  multiple
fires in outdoor environment, the merging of multiple fires can lead to
much larger fire sizes, and hence an adverse impact along the facade.
Window-ejected flame interaction and merging characteristics from two
parallel  windows  of  fires  were  first  investigated  in  [75],  where  the
window dimensions, the separation distances of the windows and the
HRRs  were  accounted  for.  By  observing  the  flame  ejection  behavior,

three  different  stages  have  been  identified  with  different  separation
distances between the two windows, as shown in Fig. 11: (a) the ejected
flames  merge  continuously  when  the  window  separation  distance  is
small; (b) the ejected flames merge intermittently as the window sepa-
ration distance is gradually increased a ‘moderate’ distance; and (c) the
ejected flames do not merge for a larger window separation distance.

A time-based probability index P was introduced to characterize the
behavior of intermittent flame merging in stage (b). The flame merging
probability  P  was  found  to be  controlled  by  the  dimensionless  excess

Flame interaction and merging affects the entrainment of fresh air
into  the  ejected  fire  plumes  from  two  parallel  windows.  The  flame
merging point height is a new parameter for such merging flames. When
the separation distance between the windows is below the critical value,
the flame merging point is firstly observed at the flame tip. The merging
point  gradually  moves  down  to  the  flame  base  (taken  as  the  neutral
plane  for  under-ventilated  compartment  fire)  with  decreasing  separa-
tion  distance  between  the  windows.  The  flame  merging  point  height
above the flame base (Zf,m) is found to be increased with the window
separation  distance,  but  decreases  with  increasing  HRR  (or  Zf,0),  as
represented by the following function (Fig. 13):

Interestingly, the criterion for flame merging is found at D/Zf,0=0.3,
which is consistent with previous studies on the free multi-fire source
conditions as reported in [222].

From Eq. (24) and Fig. 13 it is clear that Zf,m<Zf,0 if D<0.3Zf,0. The
explanation is as follows. The flame interaction and flame merging form
an  additional  flame  base/air  entrainment  area  between  the  two  win-
dows  and  below  the  flame  merging  point,  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.  This
additional area, expressed by Aint = α2l1Zf, m + Z2
f, m  (α2l1Zf,m is a two-
dimensional flame surface, α2 is a coefficient representing the difference
between  two-dimensional  and  three-dimensional  entrainment,  Z2
f, m  is
the  three-dimensional  flame  surface),  affects  the  air  entrainment,
resulting in the variation of the flame height with window separation
distances.

The flame height was shown to first decrease starting from when the
window  separation  distance  is  large  and  then  to  increase  again  with
decreasing window separation distance. When the separation distance is
large enough (no flame merging), the two ejected flames are indepen-
 ̇
dent, and each flame height is related to half of the excess HRR (
Qex/2).
At the onset of flame merging, the additional flame base/air entrainment
causes a reduction in flame height, as explained above. However, when
the  double  windows  get  still  closer  to  each  other,  the  additional  air
entrainment  is  weakened  and  the  air  entrainment  between  the  two

flames is restricted as the merging point moves down. This causes the
flame height to increase again. The complex evolution of the merging
flame  height  with  separation  distance  between  the  two  windows  is
found to be well represented by the following function [75] (see Fig. 15):

Later on, the above flame interaction models have been widely used
in the dual fire scenarios, for example the twin gaseous or liquid pool
fires in an open space [227–231], the twin jet flames [232,233], and the
ceiling  jet  merging  due  to  the  combustion  of  twin  fire  sources
[234–236].

4.3. Flame interaction and merging characteristics from two windows of
lower-upper floors

As shown in Fig. 16, there can be flame interaction and merging from
two windows along the vertical direction, one above the other. Recently,

thermal  buoyancy  from  the  lower-floor,  which  pushes  the  ‘air’  flow
upward, causing a suction effect at the window of the upper-floor. Due
to the change in air entrainment of the upper-floor compartment fire,
three types of fire behavior were found [215], as shown in Fig. 17. With

flames from the lower-floor (Type III).

Based on the observations, two critical HRR values can be defined for
the lower-floor compartment fire, namely for flame ejection and flame

evolution and flame ejection from an upper-floor compartment has been
studied by Ren et al. [215] using gaseous burners as fire source. Different
from a single fire condition, the air at the window of the upper-floor will
be affected by the hot gas plume (with relatively higher temperature and
lower O2 concentration), issued from the window of the lower-floor fire
compartment. Hence, the ‘air’ flowing into the upper-floor compartment
is  influenced  by  two  factors:  (1)  the  thermal  buoyancy  at  the
upper-floor, which entrains the ‘air’ into the compartment; and (2) the

that the sum of

kW. As shown in Fig. 18, the critical HRR at the lower-floor compart-
ment for flame extinction in the upper-floor compartment is indepen-
dent  of  the  HRR  in  the  upper-floor  compartment  for  Type  I,  while  it
increases with HRR in the upper-floor compartment for Type II. For the
Type I condition, the buoyancy of the plume issued from the window of
the upper-floor compartment is relatively weak (with no flame ejection),
and the flame extinction inside the compartment is determined by the
local ambient O2 level at the window, varying accordingly with the fire/
HRR of the lower compartment, or thus “local ambient O2 at the window
controlled”. For the Type II condition, the buoyancy of the plume issued
from  the  window  of  the  upper-floor  compartment  is  relatively  strong
(with flame ejection). The local O2 concentration at the window for Type
II is then determined by the local ambient O2  level, together with the
mass  inflow  rate  at  the  window,  or  thus  “buoyancy  competition
controlled”: the buoyancy of the hot gas flow issued from the window of
the upper-floor (causing air inflow into the compartment) counteracts
the local buoyancy of the plume from the lower-floor compartment fire
(pushing  the  gases  upward  and  causing  a  flow  outward  from  the
compartment through the window) outside the window (compartment).
Then  the  criterion  was  represented  by  the  ratio  of  the  buoyancy  flux
(HRR) of lower- and upper-floors.

For the ejected fire plume flame height in Fig. 19, it was found in
[215]  that:  (1)  for  Type  II,  where  the  flame  is  initially  within  the
upper-floor fire compartment with well-ventilated conditions, the ejec-
ted  fire  plume  flame  height  is  higher  as  the  HRR  of  the  upper-floor
compartment  fire  is  higher;  and  the  flame  height  slightly  decreases
with increasing HRR from the lower compartment fire until extinction;
(2) for Type III, where the flame is initially observed to eject out of the
window of the upper-floor compartment at under-ventilated conditions,
the ejected fire plume flame height increases significantly (by about 30%
to 40%) when the lower-floor compartment fire gets involved. As the
HRR  of  the  lower-floor  compartment  fire  increases,  the  flame  height
decreases  to  a  plateau  (about  60%  -  80%  higher  than  without  the
lower-floor compartment fire), with a slight increase again as the HRR of
the  lower-floor  compartment  fire  is  further  increased,  as  a  result  of
complex evolutions of the local O2  and air entrainment controlled by
buoyancy.

4.4. Summary of the findings

To summarize the above, important flame interaction and merging
characteristics  from  two  parallel  windows  are:  the  flame-merging
probability; the merging point height; and the flame height. These are
determined by the separation distance of the two windows, the window
characteristic length scales and the HRR inside the compartment (or the
non-dimensional excess HRR).

In case the two windows are positioned one above the other, the HRR
in the lower-floor compartment has a strong impact on the fire evolution
and  flame  ejection,  as  well  as  the  flame  height  from  the  upper-floor
compartment.

These novel findings and explanations are important for the under-

standing of building fires issued from multiple windows of rooms.

5. Window-ejected fire plume behavior with external wall
constraint boundary conditions

In practice it is common for buildings in an urban environment to
have  external  wall  constraints  over  the  facade,  such  as:  an  external
facing wall; side walls beside the window; or the presence of horizontal
barriers  (like  balconies).  These  constraints  will  affect  the  flow  devel-
opment and air entrainment into the window-ejected fire plume along
facade. Hence, the characteristic parameters (flame height, temperature
profile, heat flux along the facade) will change accordingly, as discussed
in the present section.

5.1. Window-ejected fire plume behavior with constraints by an external
facing wall

The village in the city is a particular phenomenon in the process of
urbanization,  especially  in  developing  countries  such  as  China,  where
urban areas with dense building concentration exist. As shown in Fig. 20,
the window-ejected fire plumes can be affected significantly by narrow
spacing between buildings. The air entrainment into the ejected fire plume
is restricted and the flow structure, hence the characteristics of fire plume,
with a constraint due to an external facing wall, will be different from that
of a ‘free’ ejected fire plume (i.e., without such facing wall). Such window-
ejected fire plumes will pose a significant thermal impact onto nearby
buildings and quantification of its characteristics are essential to inhibit
the building-to-building fire spread in the urban environment.

The  most  important  parameter  affecting  the  window-ejected  fire

plume behavior in such a scenario is the distance between the facade
with the ejected fire plume and the external facing wall of the adjacent
building  (D,  in  Fig.  20)  [61,76–78,237-243].  A  series  of  numerical
simulations [244] and small-scale experiments [61,76,77,237,240-243]
have been conducted to investigate this effect, involving various win-
dow dimensions, HRRs and separation distances. The critical HRR for
flame ejection [76,238], temperature profile [76,237-239], heat fluxes
[61,76,77]/thermal radiation [240–242] and flame height [61,76,237,
243] have been quantified.

The temperature at a given height in the ejected fire plume increases
with reduced separation distance, leading to a higher thermal impact
(and hence the temperature profile) on the facing wall. This is due to the
increase in the flame height: the air entrainment is more restricted with

rise buildings have to be built against the mountains. The nearby hill-
side will pose another special constraint boundary condition, which can
be represented as a sloping facing wall. The effect of the slope of the
external  facing  wall  on  the  temperature  profile,  heat  flux,  and  flame
height  has  been  studied  in  [178,193].  Under  these  conditions,  the
constraint  effect  on  the  ejected  fire  plume  changes  with  the  sloping
angle. The air entrainment reduces with increasing slope θ (starting from
horizontal). As a result, it changes the flame height and heat flux [178],
as  well  as  the  temperature  profile  and  flame  trajectory  [193].  The
temperature  profile  and  flame  height  in  an  ejected  fire  plume  with  a
sloping facing wall at various angles is found to be well approximated by
the following formulas [193,245]:

reducing the separation distance. From a dimensional analysis [102], a
piecewise function, Eq. (26), was proposed to describe the flame height
as a function of the separation distance. If the separation distance ex-
ceeds  a  characteristic  length  scale,  l3  [61]  (defined  in  Fig.  5  as  the
trajectory length after which the flames turn from horizontal to vertical
due  to  the  buoyancy),  the  fire  plume  is  not  strongly  affected  by  the
presence of the facing wall. For separation distances well below l3, the
fire plume flame height increases significantly as the distance is reduced:

The  heat  flux  over  the  facade  varies  accordingly  with  the  flame

Finally, it is noted that in recent decades, glass curtain walls have
become  popular  in  modern  commercial  buildings,  forming  the
compartment  with  double-skin  (glass)  facade  (DSF).  The  thermal
behavior  (the  temperature  profile  and  the  flame  height)  from  the
window-ejected fire plumes of various glass cavity depths (the distance
between  double-skin  facade)  was  investigated  by  [244,246]  to  deter-
mine the critical condition that the plume would attach to the interior or
to the exterior skin, and found that the HRR and the opening dimension
together dominate the fire plume trajectory for given cavity width. In
addition, the window-ejected fire plume from a compartment, affecting
the  fire  spread  in  the  integrated  photo-voltaic  (PV)  system  along  the
facing wall, was reported [247], and the temperature profiled along the
flame trajectory was divided into three stages, and correlated well by the
non-dimensional  height  above  the  opening,  normalized  by  the  mean
flame height.

5.2. Window-ejected fire plume behavior with constraints by external side
walls beside the window

External side walls on a building facade beside windows are common
in modern high-rise buildings, forming a particular “U shape” channel
outside the compartment along the facade, as shown in Fig. 21. Due to
the constraining effect of the external side walls, the behavior of ejected
fire  plumes  will  be  different  from  free  conditions  without  such  side
walls. The subsequent acceleration in the upward flame spread can be
attributed to the chimney effect [248]. For example, in 2010 a fire took
place in a 38-story apartment building in Busan City, South Korea, the
fire  quickly  spreading  to  the  upper  floor  in  only  minutes  [43].  More

recently, in a residential building fire in Kaifeng City, China with similar
side wall structures, it took only a few minutes for fire to spread from the
2nd floor to the top 17th floor.

Physically, the air entrainment is essentially influenced by the sep-
aration distance between the two side walls in this “U shape” structure
over the facade. In [250], two sets of experiments with side walls located
at  both  sides  of  the  window,  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  tem-
perature  profiles  in  the  ejected  fire  plumes.  The  presence  of  the  side
walls was indicated to restrict the entrainment of fresh air from the side
directions. Later on, a series of reduced-scale experiments were carried
out to quantify the constraint effect of such side walls on the ejected fire
plume  [74,79,179,180,194,212],  confirming  that  the  ejected  flame

characteristics (such as the flame height, temperature profile and heat
flux) with side wall constraints, differ significantly from what is found in
free conditions.

In [74,79,179,180,194,212], it was suggested to distinguish between
two stages for the flame height with side wall constraints, depending on

the excess fuel amount (or non-dimensional excess HRR,
ex). For the
<1.3, the air entrainment is
“wall fire”, or relatively small fire with
mostly from the front direction normal to the building facade. In this
case, the fire plume flame height was observed to be weakly dependent
on the separation distance between the side walls. However, for a “half
>1.3),  the  air
axisymmetric  fire”  (i.e.,  relatively  large  fire  with
entrainment  is  three-dimensional  and  the  entrainment  from  the  side
direction cannot be ignored. As the air entrainment from the side  di-
rection is constrained by the presence of the side walls in this stage, the
excess  fuel  requires  a  larger  distance  to  be  completely  consumed,
resulting in higher ejected flames. The flame height is shown to increase

The above results were confirmed and augmented by CFD simula-

A recent research report [36] shows that the shape of the window
should  also  be  taken  into  account  when  considering  such  side  wall
constraint effect, especially when the aspect ratio of the width of the

Besides, it was found that the side wall length (Lt, in Fig. 21) also
affects  the  air  entrainment  and  thus  the  fire  plume  flame  height.  A
critical  side  wall  length  was  suggested  in  [79]:  Lt/D=3.  For  the
“flame-entrainment-controlled” regime, where Lt<3D, the flame height
of the “half axisymmetric fire” increases with the length of the side wall,
but  the  flame  height  of  the  “wall  fire”  still  remains  almost  constant.
When  Lt>3D  (“combustion-efficiency-controlled”  regime),  the  overall
air supply is reduced, resulting in a reduction in flame height for both
“half axisymmetric fire” and “wall fire” types with increasing side wall
length.

The temperature profile with side wall constraints was also investi-
gated. In [249] it was found that the temperature of the “half axisym-
metric  fire”  increases  due  to  increased  flame  height,  caused  by
constrained  air  entrainment.  A  dimensionless  vertical  temperature

5.3. Window-ejected fire plumes with constraints by an external
horizontal barrier

An external horizontal barrier is usually constructed between floors
as  a  traditional  measure  to  prevent  floor-to-floor  facade  fire  spread.
Examples are the fireproof horizontal barriers separating the building
floors, the horizontal projections aside corridors to the atrium area in a
large commercial complex. In order to protect the upper floors from fire
hazards effectively, the general dimensions, materials and installation
position  are  regulated  by  National  Fire  Protection  Codes  in  many
countries [253–256]. For example, according to the Code for Fire Pro-
tection Design of Building (GB 50016-2014) in China [255], if no spandrel
wall  is  used,  the  horizontal  barrier  should  be  at  least  1.0  m  long,
extending from the building facade wall, while the width of horizontal
barrier should not be shorter than the window width. Besides, the fire
resistance time should be no less than 1 hour for a horizontal barrier.
Also, the horizontal barrier should be set to at least 760 mm in America,
while 0.6 m in New Zealand [257] in the absence of the spandrel wall.
The  development  of  window-ejected  fire  plumes  is  significantly
altered by the presence of an external horizontal barrier, as the buoyant
fire plume issued from the window first has to spread horizontally below
the barrier, and then turns upward at the end of the barrier. The effect of
horizontal barrier on the window-ejected fire plume was first investi-
gated  by  Oleszkiewicz  [81],  showing  that  the  horizontal  barriers  can
provide substantial protection for the facade above the window, because
the heat flux intensity upon the vertical facade is reduced. Later, cor-
relations were developed for the mass flow of a two-dimensional plume
from  a  room  balcony  under  various  conditions  [258].  The  mass  flow
rates of a balcony spill plume were also deduced based on CFD simu-
lations [82]. A series of systematic investigations were reported in [83,
85,87,88,90–93,96] to investigate the mass flow rate of gas at the spill
edge of the balcony, a crucial input parameter for balcony spill plume
calculations in the design of smoke ventilation systems. The fire-induced
aerodynamics of a balcony spill plume was investigated numerically in
[89], showing that the spill plume would behave more likely as a “line
plume” when the balcony width is much greater than the hot gas flow
thickness  beneath  the  balcony  edge.  However,  the  spill  plume  would

transform  into  three-dimensional  with  reducing  balcony  width.  The
study on air entrainment into balcony spill plumes was also discussed in
[94].  The  above  works  provide  important  references  for  research
involved with the thermal characteristics of window-ejected fire plumes
with a horizontal barrier structure.

free  condition

The  ejected  fire  plume  development  from  the  window  of  a
compartment with the projection of a horizontal barrier can be divided
into three different types, as shown in Fig. 23 [100]. Type 1 corresponds
to a weak-buoyancy-driven barrier flow, as the ejected flame does not
reach the horizontal barrier. The flame height is almost the same as that
of  a
to  a
strong-buoyancy-driven barrier flow, in which the ejected flame touches
the horizontal barrier and spreads horizontally underneath the barrier.
When the flame is long enough to get beyond the barrier end, it turns
upward again, forming Type 3. The temperature profile, flame height
(related to the flame extension length below the horizontal barrier), and
the  heat  flux  upon  the  building  facade  with  horizontal  barrier  con-
straints is essentially different from those in free conditions.

A  reduced-scale  experiment  was  set  up  in  [84]  to  investigate  the
ejected flame behavior from a compartment fire, affected by the balcony
depth  (or  horizontal  barrier  length).  Results  showed  that  with  the
presence of balcony, the angle of the fire plume flame changed, playing
an important role in reducing the heat flux upon the facade above the
window. A three-floor fire model of the experiments of [84] was set up in
[86] with FDS, revealing that once the balcony is longer than 15 cm (i.e.,
1.05  m  full-scale),  the  temperature  along  the  facade  decreases  more
rapidly.  With  increasing  horizontal  barrier  length,  the  ejected  fire
plumes are projected further away from the building facade [250]. The
CFD  simulations  of  [95]  showed  that  the  temperature  of  fire  plume
along  the  building  facade  at  upper  floors  can  be  reduced  to  below  a
critical  hazardous  temperature  when  the  balcony  extends  to  1.2  m.
When the balcony (barrier) width (parallel to the facade) is sufficiently
large, the balcony depth (normal to the facade) is the dominant barrier
effect [97]. The 2D temperature profile of the ejected fire plume with the
presence of various horizontal barrier conditions was provided in [98],
based  on  a  medium-scale  compartment  with  dimension  of  0.8  m,
showing consistent results with previously reported results [250].

If  the  horizontal  barrier  is  not  long  enough,  the  overflow  of  ejected
plume in the segment of S2  (Fig. 24 (b)) determines the ejected flame
height in Type 3. A model regarding the ejected flame height in terms of

5.4. Summary of the findings

The  external  wall  constraint  boundary  conditions  have  a  strong
impact on the window-ejected fire plume behavior, primarily through
air  entrainment.  In  case  of  horizontal  barriers,  the  fire  plume  is  also
moved essentially moved away from the facade, reducing heat transfer
to the upper floors at the facade.

Everything is determined by the length scales at the origin of the fire
plume on the one hand, and geometrical distances on the other hand.
The flame height and temperature, and thus the resulting heat flux upon
the facade, can increase due the presence of a facing wall or sidewalls
beside the window, as the air entrainment is restricted. This implies a
more dangerous situation. If the facing or side walls are sufficiently far
from the fire plume, there is no effect.

horizontal barrier can be categorized into  three different types of be-
haviors  [100]:  Type  1,  where  the  fire  plume  flame  tip  is  below  the
barrier; Type 2, with horizontal fire plume spread along the barrier; and
Type 3, with fire plume flame overflow beyond the horizontal barrier.

6. Window-ejected fire plume behavior under sub-atmospheric
pressure

The  classical  model/theory  of  the  window-ejected  fire  plume
behavior  considers  that  the  fire  occurs  under  standard  atmospheric
pressure conditions. This needs to be revisited for conditions at lower
pressure, such as found at high altitudes above sea level.

characteristics  under  sub-atmospheric  pressure  were  reported  in
[101–104], using 1/8 model-scale cubic compartments with dimensions
of 0.4 m (height)×0.4 m (width)×0.4 m (length) experiments in Lhasa
(64  kPa).  The  obtained  results  were  compared  to  those  done  corre-
spondingly  in  Hefei  city  (100  kPa).  The  environmental  conditions  in
Hefei and Lhasa cities are shown in Table 8.

First, it is known that the critical HRR for flame ejection through the
window  in  standard  atmospheric  pressure  condition  (100  kPa)  is
1500AH1/2 kW. However, for sub-atmospheric pressure, the air density,
and  hence  the  air/oxygen  mass  inflow  rate  of  the  sub-atmospheric
pressure  effect,  is  lower,  and  the  critical  HRR  for  flame  ejection  be-
comes [101]:

(39)

There are extensive areas at high altitudes on Earth. It is known that
the atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude. Hence, the
urban  environment  on  a  high  altitude  plateau  has  a  natural  sub-
atmospheric pressure. Examples are Lhasa (altitude: 3650 m: ambient
pressure: 64 kPa) and Shangri-La (altitude: 3300 m: ambient pressure:
68 kPa), where fire incidents have happened, causing huge economic/
heritage losses and casualties. In these sub-atmospheric pressure envi-
ronments, the absolute oxygen content in the air and the air mass density
decrease.  Such  a  sub-atmospheric  pressure  will  inherently  affect  the
compartment fire behavior and the window-ejected fire plume behavior:
(1)  the  relatively  lower  oxygen  content  will  change  the  combustion,
particularly the fire inside the compartment where ventilation (oxygen)
plays  an  essential  role;  (2)  the  relatively  lower  air  density/ambient
pressure  will  change  the  buoyancy  effect,  and  hence  the  buoyancy-
induced  turbulent  air  entrainment.  This  will  change  the  fire  plume
characteristics (flame height, temperature profile). It is also known that
the buoyancy effect is weaker in reduced ambient pressure [259,260].
Recently, extensive sets of experiments have been executed in Tibet,
China,  at  the  sub-atmospheric/high-altitude  experimental  base  of  the
State  Key  Laboratory  of  Fire  Science  (SKLFS),  investigating  the  com-
bustion and fire characteristics of wood crib fires [261–265], pool fires
[266–275]  and  jet  fires  [276–287].  These  studies  showed  that  the
combustion  rate  (and  also  blow-out/lift-off  behavior)  [261–270,272,
273], the flame morphologic characteristics (flame height, length, size,
volume  and  flame  base  drag  length  (flame  base  extension  along  the
ground)  with  a  cross-flow)  [268,269,272–274,277,279,280,283–287],
flame oscillation frequency (fluctuation range) [267,268,279], radiation
characteristics  [275,281],  plume  temperature  [270,278,282]  and  fire
spreading [264] in a sub-atmospheric pressure (64 kPa), is remarkably
different from that in standard atmospheric pressure (100 kPa). The air
entrainment,  controlled by buoyancy in the sub-atmospheric  pressure
(64 kPa), was found to be only 0.8 times that in standard pressure (100
kPa),  resulting  in  weaker  turbulent  flame  pulsation  and  less  air
entrainment and hence increased flame height. Therefore, it is necessary
to  discuss  the  physical  mechanism  and  fire  characteristics  of
window-ejected fire plumes from a compartment under sub-atmospheric
pressure (a high altitude).

6.2. Window-ejected fire plume behavior from a compartment under sub-
atmospheric pressure

This  results  in  lower  temperatures  at  a  sub-atmospheric  pressure
condition  [102].  This  also  means  that  a  compartment  fire  at  a  high
altitude  in  sub-atmospheric  pressure  will  reach  under-ventilated  con-
ditions more easily, i.e., the flame ejects earlier, with more unburned
fuel issued from the window, and hence relatively larger HRR/flame size
outside.

As for the window-ejected fire plume characteristics, the tempera-
ture [101,103], heat flux [104] and flame height [102] have also been
quantified  at  a  sub-atmospheric  pressure  (64  kPa)  condition.  It  was
found that the temperature of the ejected fire plume at a given height is
higher, but decreases faster in the direction normal to the facade than in
standard pressure (100 kPa). This is due to low air density/entrainment
at sub-atmospheric pressure, leading to less efficient diffusion/mixing
between the fire plume and the surrounding air. A correction factor is
thus  recommended  to  account  for  the  change  in  air  entrainment  at
sub-atmospheric  pressure,  (α/αHefei)4/5=0.8,  to  describe  the  vertical
temperature profile in ejected fire plumes, where α and αHefei are the air
entrainment  coefficient  at  sub-atmospheric  and  standard  atmospheric
pressure, respectively.

The  change  in  air  entrainment  also  results  in  a  change  in  flame
height, which consequently leads to a change in heat flux profile upon
the building facade. As the air entrainment is reduced, the fire plume
flame height, and hence the extension of the heat flux profile upon the
facade,  is  larger in  the  sub-atmospheric  pressure  than  in  standard at-
mospheric pressure. By accounting for the air entrainment change, the
equations were proposed for the flame height [102] and heat flux profile
[104] for sub-atmospheric pressures.

All  the  above  results  indicate  a  higher  fire  safety  risk  caused  by
window-ejected fire plumes at sub-atmospheric pressure: compartment
fires  reach  under-ventilated  conditions  earlier,  with  flame  ejection
through  the  window  and  more  excess  fuel  burns  outside,  leading  to
higher excess HRR, and larger flame heights and heat fluxes upon the
facade.  The  critical  separation  distance  required  between  adjacent
buildings (facing facade) was consequently also found to be relatively
larger in sub-atmospheric pressure conditions [45].

6.3. Summary of the findings

Sub-atmospheric pressure conditions at a high altitude have a sig-
nificant effect on the window-ejected fire plume behavior, due to the

change of air density, as well as a change in air entrainment intensity.
The relatively higher flame height at a high altitude suggests that haz-
ards of window-ejected fire plumes at lower pressure (a high altitude)
are generally more severe, and thus require more conservative regula-
tions than those for standard atmospheric pressure conditions.

7. Window-ejected fire plume behavior under conditions with
external wind

Wind  is  almost  always  involved  in  fires  outside  the  compartment
(outdoor). The ambient wind interacts with fire-induced buoyancy in a
complex manner and the turbulent air entrainment determines the flame
structure  and  diffusive  combustion  [7,15,16,19,20,28,30,44].  In  gen-
eral, and thus also for a high-rise building in an urban environment, the
wind speed increases with height above the ground. For example, in the
urban area of big cities like Hong Kong [288] with high buildings and
large mansions, the mean wind speed at 32 m above sea level is about
2.61-7.67  m/s  and  the  maximum  wind  speed  can  reach  50  m/s.  The
theory on the window-ejected fire plume behavior, established without
wind and considering the fire-induced buoyancy only, will not be suf-
ficient  to  account  for  wind  conditions.  Ambient  wind  is  indeed  an
important boundary condition for fire in urban environment in reality:
(1) the ambient wind will have an important influence on the air flow
into the compartment. It will thus fundamentally change the flow con-
ditions  (inflow  and  outflow)  at  the  window.  As  a  result,  the  neutral
plane, air ventilation and the critical HRR for flame ejection will change
accordingly.

(2) the air entrainment into the ejected fire plumes along the facade
will  change  significantly  through  the  complicated  coupling  effect  of
buoyancy  and  ambient  wind  momentum/inertia  force.  The  scale  and
structure of the flame/fire plume will thus change significantly, result-
ing in remarkable changes in the characteristic parameter profiles.

In  reality,  the  ambient  wind  can  act  on  the  window-ejected  fire
plume  behavior  along  the  facade  in  different  directions,  such  as:  a
‘facing wind’ to the compartment window; ‘sideward wind’, parallel to
the window; or wind passing over the roof, acting on the ejected fire
plume  issued  from  a  high  storey,  forming  a  complex  flow  boundary
layer. In this section, these three typical scenarios of window-ejected fire
plume behavior with external wind are discussed, (1) facing wind, (2)
sideward wind; and (3) back-roof wind (for an ejected fire plume from
the top storey).

Fig.  26. Variations  of  the  critical  HRR  for  flame  ejection  with  facing  wind
speed. (Reprinted from [38] with permission from Elsevier).

(1)  The competition of the wind flow with the buoyant flow at the
window, determining how much wind (fresh air) flows into the
compartment. This is called the “wind venting effect”.

(2)  The  mixing  of  the  wind  with  the  buoyant  flow  inside  the

compartment, called the “wind vent-mixing effect”.

These two mechanisms can be characterized by two non-dimensional
Froude numbers, along with a third factor, accounting for the ratio of the
heat  release  inside  the  compartment  to  the  heat  loss  rate  from  the
compartment.

The temperature difference between upper- and lower- parts inside
the compartment first increases and then decreases with increasing HRR
[135,289]. When the temperature difference drops to a lower value with
increasing  HRR,  the  fire  condition  inside  the  compartment  can  be
considered  as  a  well-mixed  condition.  It  is  found  that  [135]  the
compartment fire reaches the well-mixed conditions more easily with a

facing wind. The critical HRR (

For facing wind conditions (normal to the window and facade), the
temperature evolution inside a fire compartment has been investigated
in [135,289], focusing on the impact on the evolution of a compartment
fire from a stratified condition to a well-mixed condition. As shown in
Fig. 25, there are two aspects in the physical mechanisms of this effect:

Regardless  of  the  HRR,  the  temperature  difference  between  the
upper-  (Tu)  and  lower-  (Tl)  parts  inside  the  compartment  (Tu–Tl)  de-
creases considerably with increasing wind speed [289]. A basic function
was proposed in [289], accounting for the three factors summarized in

leading  to  a  higher  critical  HRR  to  reach  under-ventilated  conditions
(leading to flame ejection). However, at relatively higher wind speed,
the strong “venting effect” directly pumps fuel outside the compartment,
even  though  it  may  be  still  in  over-ventilated  conditions,  so  that  the
critical  HRR  for  flame  ejection  decreases  with  increasing  wind  speed
then.

After the flame ejection, the facing wind will also have a significant
effect on the air entrainment into the ejected fire plume, determining its
basic  characteristics  (flame  height  [135],  temperature  profiles  [195,
196]). The latest research advances [135] show that the facing wind will
enhance  the  air  entrainment  from  the  direction  normal  to  the  facade
wall (which can be characterized by an increase of entrainment length
scale  l1)  as  shown  in  Fig.  27,  and  meanwhile  suppresses  the  air
entrainment from the direction parallel to the facade wall (which can be
characterized by a reduction of entrainment length scale l2). Besides,
the air entrainment from the front direction has a stronger effect than
that  from  the  side  direction,  so  that  there  is  an  overall  enhanced  air
entrainment, leading to a reduction in flame height. Through the anal-
ysis of air entrainment, a new combined characteristic air entrainment
length scale (or an “effective flame entrainment perimeter”) under fac-
ing wind was proposed as follows:

where  UW  is  the  wind  speed  and  Lc  is  the  length  of  the  cubic
compartment.

The venting effect and vent-mixing effect of a facing wind signifi-
cantly  affect  the  combustion  condition  inside  the  compartment.  As  a
consequence, it also affects the critical HRR for flame ejection, which is
an important parameter for the window-ejected fire plume: it first in-
creases  and  then  decreases  with  increasing  wind  speed  for  relatively
larger  windows  (W×H,  cm,  15×15,  10×20),  and  decreases  mono-
tonically  for  relatively  smaller  windows  (W×H,  cm,  15×10,  10×15,
20×10), as shown in Fig. 26. The initial increase is due to the air (ox-
ygen) supply effect for the facing wind at relatively low wind speeds.
With more air supplied, more fuel is consumed inside the compartment,

where Zf,v  is the flame height under facing wind, and Zf,0  is the flame
height without wind.

Later, the vertical and lateral temperature profiles of the fire plume
ejected  from  the  window  under  facing  wind  were  investigated  [195,
196]. Due to the enhanced air entrainment, both the vertical and lateral
temperature  decrease  with  increasing  wind  speed.  The  vertical  tem-
perature  evolution  of  the  fire  plume  still  accords  to  the  classical
three-region-theory, but the correlation coefficient (κw) decreases with
increasing wind speed. Similarly, a non-dimensional factor K3 (the ratio
of  a  fitting  coefficient  with  wind  (κw)  to  that  without  wind  (κ0))  was
proposed  to  characterize  the  evolution  of  vertical  temperature  under
facing wind effect (in Fig. 28 (a)):

7.2. Window-ejected fire plume behavior with external sideward wind

The wind can also flow parallel to the facade, resulting in a ‘sideward
wind’  condition [290]. The effect of sidewind on the window-ejected
fire  plume  behavior  is  fundamentally  different  from  the  facing  wind
condition, changing the flow, turbulent mixing and fire combustion in-
side the compartment, as well as the air entrainment and deflection of
the ejected fire plume outside the window (compartment).

7.2.1. Temperature evolution and transition inside the fire compartment

With  an  external  sideward  wind,  an  interesting  transition  of  the
flame position with increasing HRR was observed, resulting in a complex
spatial temperature evolution inside the compartment [35]. At relatively
low  HRR,  the  flame  tilts  towards  the  windward  side  inside  the
compartment. With increasing HRR, though, the flame position transits
to the leeward side (Fig. 29). The transition of the flame position then
results in a transition of the temperature profile between the leeward
 ̇
and  windward  sides.  The  critical  HRR  (
Qcritical)  for  this  transition  is
shown to decrease as the sideward wind speed increases, and increases
with the window size. A non-dimensional correlation has been proposed
to characterize the critical HRR, as a function of a derived wind Froude
number [35]:

7.2.2. Flame height and horizontal extension distance of the ejected fire
plumes

In addition to the flame height [162], a new parameter, namely the
flame  horizontal  extension  distance  parallel  to  the  facade,  has  to  be
considered  for  sideward  wind  condition  [291].  These  two  important
parameters determine the critical conditions in how far the flame can
touch and ignite combustible material above or beside the window with
external  sideward  wind.  A  recent  report  [291]  showed  that:  (1)  the
flame height (Zf,v) decreases monotonously and significantly with side-
ward wind speed, and the increase of flame height with HRR is more
remarkable  as  the  sideward  wind  speed  is  lower;  and  (2)  the  ejected
flame horizontal extension distance (Wf,v) first increases and then de-
creases with increasing sideward wind speed for relatively small win-
dows, while it increases monotonically with sideward wind speed  for
relatively  large  windows.  For  relatively  large  windows  and  higher
sideward wind speed, Wf,v  will be even larger than the corresponding
flame height without wind.

Two basic mechanisms control the fire plume flame under sideward
wind condition (Fig. 31), summarized by two dimensionless quantities:
the ratio of air entrainment caused by the sideward wind to that induced

by the flame buoyancy itself in the absence of wind (

caused  by  sideward  wind  [51,292–294].  Basic  formulae  are  thus
developed  to  represent  the  fire  plume  flame  height  and  horizontal
extension distance under external sideward wind conditions.

7.3. Window-ejected fire plume behavior under a back-roof wind

There is another basic and practical scenario, namely a fire occurring
in a compartment at the top storey of a building, while ambient back-
roof wind passes over the roof to approach the flame. Under this con-
dition (back-roof wind), the wind effect on the flame behavior and its
morphologic characteristics will be essentially different from those re-
ported previously without  wind  or with  normal facing wind  [38,137,
195,196,289] or sideward wind [35,291]. Under this ambient back-roof
wind condition, the flame height, flame width and especially the flame
downwind horizontal extension distance and the overall flame length
will  all  change  significantly,  due  to  the  flame  tilting  effect  and  the
change  in  air  entrainment  and  mixing.  It  is  noted  that  these  flame
morphological  characteristics  are  crucial  to  determine  the  thermal
impact  on,  and  even  possible  ignition  of,  the  facade  of  downwind
adjacent buildings. A recent study [295] showed that:

(1)  At  relatively  low  wind  speeds,  i.e.,  ≤0.5  m/s,  the  three  flame
morphological  characteristics  (flame  height  (Zf,v),  flame  width
(Wf,v), and flame downwind horizontal extension distance (Lf,v))
change little with ambient back-roof wind. However, with further
increasing ambient back-roof wind  speed, the flame  height de-
creases,  while  the  flame  width  and  the  flame  downwind  hori-
zontal  extension  distance  increase  significantly,  resulting  in  a
complex evolution of overall flame length.

(2) The flame height changes more remarkably with HRR for rela-
tively  low  wind  speeds,  while  the  flame  width  and  the  flame
downwind  horizontal  extension  distance  change  more  remark-
ably with HRR for relatively higher wind speeds.

The evolutions of flame  height and  the flame  width with ambient
back-roof  wind  are  controlled  by  the  combined  mechanisms  of  flame
deflection by the wind and the change in air entrainment and mixing for
the flame body above the roof. Three aspects are involved as shown in
Figs. 32 (a) and (b), summarized into three non-dimensional parameters:
(1) the total volume of the ejected flame or the excess fuel outside the
compartment, and hence (Zf,0+Zf,T)/l1; (2) the part of the ejected flame
that  directly  interacts  with  the  horizontal  back-roof  wind,  i.e.,  Zf,0/
(Zf,0+Zf,T),  where  the  air  entrainment  and  mixing  is  changed  by  the
wind; (3) the competition between the horizontal wind momentum and
the  buoyancy-induced  vertical  momentum.  This  is  expressed  by  the
wind Froude number (Fr= Ub/
[51,292–294], where Zf,T
is the flame height from the neutral plane in the window to the roof level
of the compartment) [51,292–294]. The Zf,0/(Zf,0+Zf,T) is absent when
considering the flame width, as this considers the facade wall (below the

The evolution of the flame downwind horizontal extension distance

partly bound by the facade and partly affected by the ambient wind, as
well as the flame deflection by the ambient back-roof wind (Fig. 32 (c)).

7.4. Summary of the findings

External  facing/side/back-roof  wind  has  a  significant  impact  on

window-ejected fire plume behavior from a compartment.

Facing wind stimulates the evolution of the compartment fire into
well-mixed conditions (starting from a stratified situation). It also affects
the air entrainment into the ejected fire plume.

Sideward  wind  (inertia  force)  and  heat  released  inside  the
compartment  (buoyancy)  together  determine  the  flame  location
(leeward/windward) inside the compartment. The external flame would
tilt and move along the wind direction, resulting in a reduction of the
flame vertical height and an increase in the horizontal flame dimension.
These  fire  plume  flame  shape  parameters  are  governed  by  the  air
entrainment  change  and  by  the  tilting  of  the  flame  as  caused  by  the
wind. These latest findings are essential steps to develop guidelines for
fire safe designs of buildings and the separation distance between them
(which is important in urban environments) considering the influence of
wind.

For a fire at the top floor of a high building with ‘back wind’  (i.e.,
wind coming from over the roof of the building), the fire plume flame
height, width and horizontal extension distance, are strongly affected by
the interplay between the ejected fire plume and the inertial force of the
wind. When  strong enough, the latter can partially block the upward
motion of the fire plume, leading to a widening of the flame shape.

8. Perspectives

This  review  paper  aimed  to  present  a  comprehensive  review  of
window-ejected  fire  plume  dynamics  theory  and  modelling  under

various external boundary and ambient conditions, including flow re-
strictions by the presence of walls outside (facing wall or sidewall), sub-
atmospheric  pressure  and  complex  flow  conditions  due  to  wind  from
different directions. There are still many unresolved challenges, to be
addressed  from a  scientific research  point  of view  in  order  to further
develop practical fire safety engineering. A selection is mentioned here.
Scaling  analyses  as  used  for  the  behavior  of  window-ejected  fire
plumes  along  the  facade  usually  consider  reduced-scale  experimental
models, based on the Froude similarity [296]. However, in the context of
interaction with wind, scaling based on the Froude number only is not
sufficient.  This  brings  upon  the  issue  of  to  what  extent  data  from
small-scale  experiments  can  be  extrapolated  to  full-scale  situations,
while, full-scale experimental data for window-ejected fire plumes are
very  valuable,  but  resource-consuming,  especially  for  complicated
boundary conditions. Yet, full-scale experiments should be considered to
verify the existing models in the future. Also CFD simulations can be
helpful to bring additional insight into flow and combustion phenomena
(inside and outside the compartment), as well as to clarify the validity
and limitations of scaling results (see, e.g., [297,298]).

As observed in real high-rise building fire incidents, flames can eject
from many windows over multiple floors and the interactions between
multiple  fire  plumes  (in  both  horizontal  and  vertical  direction  at  the
same time) are very complex. This needs to be studied further and more
deeply: the ejected flame interaction of multiple windows with different
arrangements and wind conditions are suggested to be further taken into
consideration.

Window-ejected  fire  plume  behavior  under  sub-atmospheric  pres-
sure  (64  kPa)  has  been  investigated  recently.  However,  the  present
findings  are  limited  to  only  one  single  sub-atmospheric  pressure,
whereas cities exist at many different altitudes and hence different sub-
atmospheric  pressures.  More  investigation  efforts,  with  local  experi-
ments at various elevations, will be useful to further extend the findings
and to give a more complete mapping of the window-ejected fire plume
dynamics in various sub-atmospheric pressures (high altitudes). Again,
CFD simulations can be a very useful complement, as it is straightfor-
ward to adjust ambient pressure conditions in CFD.

Although there has been significant progress  in understanding the
window-ejected fire plume behavior from a compartment with external
wind conditions recently, there are important remaining aspects to be
addressed, such as:

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience94(2023)10103931

X. Sun et al.

(1) The wind direction is variable in reality, leading to different de-
grees of impact on window-ejected fire plumes, forming compli-
cated facade boundary conditions [299,300].

(2)  The  experimental  wind  speed  has  thus  far  been  limited  to  the
range 0~3.0 m/s, while velocities can be much higher in reality.
It should be investigated  systematically if a  higher  wind speed
could result in flame extinction due to the fresh air “cooling ef-
fect” or “blow-off effect”.

(3) There has been little research on the ejected fire plume charac-
teristic parameters (heat flux by radiation and convection; tem-
perature  profiles;  and  flame  dimensions)  for  the  facing  and
sideward wind conditions. These are not only determined by the
flame (hot buoyancy): the wind cooling effect should be consid-
ered. All these aspects should be carefully studied in the future.
Well-documented  databases  from  experiments  can  then  also
serve a validation effort of CFD simulations for these conditions,
so that the latter can be used to study configurations that have not
been tested in experiments.
