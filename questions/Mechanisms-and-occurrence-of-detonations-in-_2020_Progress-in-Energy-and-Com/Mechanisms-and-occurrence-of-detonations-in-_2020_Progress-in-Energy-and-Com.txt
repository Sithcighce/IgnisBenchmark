Not all accidental releases of ﬂammable gases and vapors create explosions. Most releases do not ﬁnd 
an ignition source, and of those that do ignite, most of them result in deﬂagrations that generate low or 
moderate overpressures. Under some circumstances, however, it is possible for deﬂagration-to-detonation 
transition (DDT) to occur, and this can be followed by a propagating detonation that quickly consumes 
the remaining detonable cloud. In a detonable cloud, a detonation creates the worst accident that can 
happen. Because detonation overpressures are much higher than those in a deﬂagration and continue 
through the entire detonable cloud, the damage from a DDT event is more severe. 

This paper ﬁrst provides a brief summary of our knowledge to date of the fundamental mechanisms 
of ﬂame acceleration and DDT. This information is then contrasted to and combined with evidence of 
detonations (detonation markers) obtained from large-scale tests and actual large vapor cloud explosions 
(VCEs), including events at Bunceﬁeld (UK), Jaipur (India), CAPECO (Puerto Rico), and Port Hudson (US). 
The major conclusion from this review is that detonations did occur in prior VCEs in at least part of the 
VCE accidents. Finally, actions are suggested that could be taken to minimize detonation hazards.

1. Introduction 

Accidental  explosions  of  hydrocarbon-air  mixtures  in  oil  and 
gas  industries  are  known  hazards  that  are  a  danger  to  life  and 
property. When such explosions occur, industry carries out detailed 
investigations to determine the root cause of the accident. This in- 
formation is then used to design facilities or create procedures that 
will minimize the chance of recurrence. 

There  are  now  signiﬁcant  advances  in  knowledge  and  under- 
standing  of  the  fundamental  properties  of  deﬂagrations,  detona- 
tions, and their similarities and differences. There are also a sig- 
niﬁcant  number  of  accidental  vapor  cloud  explosions  (VCEs)  for 
which there is signiﬁcant quantitative and qualitative information 
preceding and following the explosion event that generated over- 
pressures. Finally, this information has now been supplemented by 
ﬁeld tests demonstrating damage created in large-scale systems af- 
ter detonations. Given all of this information, it is now an appro- 
priate time to review and to re-evaluate circumstances of prior ac- 
cidents with intense VCEs. 

For many years, the combustion and process safety communi- 
ties have understood that intense explosions can arise from igni- 
tion  of  ﬂammable  gases  or  vapors,  such  as  mixtures  of  air  and 
hydrogen  or  hydrocarbons.  Recent  events  have  shown  that  an 
extremely  destructive  explosion  can  arise  from  ignition  of  large 
clouds containing hydrocarbon-air mixtures. Now as a result of in- 
depth investigations of the recent VCEs at Bunceﬁeld [1–4] , Puerto 
Rico [5] , and Jaipur [6,7] , our concepts of the intensity of combus- 
tion that can occur in a VCE have changed dramatically. We now 
understand that, under circumstances deﬁned by congestion, con- 
ﬁnement, atmospheric conditions, and the speciﬁc fuel-air mixture, 
the most intense and dangerous combustion phenomena, fast de- 
ﬂagrations and detonations, can occur in VCEs. 

Preceding  and  parallel  to  these  investigations  of  accidental 
large-scale VCEs, fundamental knowledge of deﬂagrations, detona- 
tions, and the transition of a deﬂagration to a detonation (DDT) in 
fuel-air mixtures has improved to the point where we now have 
some understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the events 
that create and allow this transition (see, e.g., [8–11] ). For exam- 
ple, we now have knowledge of the temporal and spatial scales on 
which DDT can occur. We know that shock waves and the back- 

ground congestion and conﬁnement are extremely important for 
ﬂame  acceleration,  and  these  can  set  the  stage  for  DDT.  Finally, 
from very recent work, we now know that if the mixture is suf- 
ﬁciently reactive and the mixtures become turbulent, DDT can oc- 
cur with minimal [12,13] or even no congestion [14] . As shown in 
Section  2 ,  we  are  even  beginning  to  understand  how  and  when 
these mechanisms can come into play. 

Fig. 1 presents a qualitative picture of how ﬂame acceleration 
and DDT occurs. The ﬁgure separates the process into ﬁve phases: 

• Slow  deﬂagration  phase ,  in  which  the  speed  of  the  deﬂagra- 
tion  increases  due  to  increases  in  the  surface  area  of  the 
ﬂame which, in turn, is caused by ﬂame and ﬂow interactions 
with congestion, conﬁnement or background turbulence. In this 
stage, there is also a contribution to the ﬂame surface area from 
ﬂame instabilities. The very early stages of this slow deﬂagra- 
tion, when the velocity is in the range 10–30 m/s, is often called 
a cloud ﬁre when referring to large-scale deﬂagrations. The de- 
ﬂagration speed in this phase can eventually reach the speed of

a deﬂagration to a detonation.

sound in the mixture. For hydrocarbon-air mixtures, this is the 
region up to ∼ 350 m/s. (As described in the next section of this 
paper, the increase of ﬂame surface area is due to congestion, 
conﬁnement or turbulence.) 

• Fast  deﬂagration  phase ,  also  called  the  fast  ﬂame  stage .  Here 
the accelerating turbulent ﬂame generates pressure waves that 
eventually form into a strong leading shock downstream of the 
ﬂame. The shock waves compress the ﬂow ahead of the deﬂa- 
gration, and so decrease the reaction time. 

The  area  between  the  deﬂagration  and  leading  shock  waves 
becomes  extremely  turbulent  and  may  contain  many  interacting 
shock waves. These shock waves also interact with the turbulent 
ﬂame, and so further increase the ﬂame surface area. The result 
is that the turbulent deﬂagration speed increases further, to the 
point where it may approach  ∼ 0.5 D 
cj , that is, about half of the 
Chapman-Jouguet  detonation  velocity,  D 
cj ,  of  the  detonable  mix- 
ture. 1 

• Pre-detonation  phase .  The  is  a  relatively  short  time  in  which 
shocks and shock interactions create conditions in which DDT 
will occur. One of the salient features of this phase is the cou- 
pling between the leading shock and deﬂagration. There is of- 
ten no clear transition between the most intense part of the 
fast deﬂagration and pre-detonation phases. 

• Overdriven detonation , which occurs when conditions behind a 
leading shock front reach a critical value, the system transitions 
to a detonation. Immediately after this transition, the detona- 
tion is originally overdriven and the local pressure at the DDT 
site  can  become  very  large.  However,  the  overdriven  detona- 
tion phase is of very short duration, hence it generates propor- 
tionally smaller impulse and, therefore, for a real plant envi- 
ronment, it is of less concern compared to other combustion 
phases presented. 

• Stable  detonation  propagation ,  in  which  the  steady  detonation 
propagates at a speed of  ∼ 1800 m/s, until it runs out of det- 
onable material or is disrupted in some way. 2 

A more detailed explanation of the physical processes occurring 
in each phase and transition is given in Section 2 , where numer- 
ical simulations and laboratory experiments are used to describe 
details of these stages and the transition among them. 

There are critical differences in the properties of deﬂagrations 
and detonations that indicate that if a detonation does occur in a 
ﬂammable cloud, it is much more devastating than a deﬂagration 
alone. First, the overpressure generated by a detonation is much 
larger  than  could  be  generated  in  a  deﬂagration.  A  deﬂagration 
initially travels through the ﬂammable regions of the cloud, start- 
ing at speeds of a few m/s. Within congested areas, deﬂagration 
speeds can rise to the sound speed,  ∼ 350 m/s, and generate over- 
pressures from ∼ 10 −3  atm to a few atm in fast deﬂagrations. A 
propagating detonation, however, travels through the vapor cloud 
at  ∼ 1800 m/s with overpressures of  ∼ 18 atm or more behind a 
leading shock front. The detonation thus consumes the detonable 
mixture very rapidly. As it exits the detonable mixture, the deto- 
nation wave travels as a lower-speed shock wave that is, however, 
still strong enough to break glass many kilometers away. 

The value of the peak overpressure is not the only parameter to 
consider in assessing response of a structure to overpressure. The

The Chapman-Jouguet velocity, D cj , is a property of the energetic gas that does 
not vary greatly with equivalence ratio. It does vary somewhat with temperature, 
pressure, etc. This is a topic discussed in many textbooks on combustion. 

There are are relatively stable detonation states (galloping detonations, marginal 
detonations) that form and propagate at lower or highly oscillating velocities, but 
this property of detonations is left for a more thorough review of possible detona- 
tion states. 

impulse, which is the integral of overpressure over time, is an im- 
portant parameter. The most damaging case is that of a high over- 
pressure that lasts for a long time. In the initial phase of detona- 
tion development, or in the case of a reﬂected detonation wave, 
the overpressures are very high. The impulse, however, might not 
be that damaging as the duration of these overpressures is rela- 
tively short. 

Various types of obstructions, such as process equipment, pip- 
ing,  trees,  buildings,  or  vehicles,  have  a  signiﬁcant  effect  on 
ﬂame acceleration. This complexity will be discussed continually 
throughout this report. Nonetheless, once a detonation is created, 
even in a very small region of a detonable mixture, the detonation 
will propagate through the entire detonable material. That is, no 
congestion is necessary to sustain detonation propagation through the 
detonable mixture . In contrast to the case of a detonation, conges- 
tion is required to sustain the overpressure in deﬂagrations. Out- 
side of the congested regions, the ﬂame speed decays quickly and, 
therefore, the deﬂagration overpressure decreases quickly. 

This paper ﬁrst describes some of the fundamental concepts de- 
veloped and published over the past twenty years on the nature 
of deﬂagrations, detonations, and the complex transition processes. 
The emphasis here is on those fundamentals that the authors feel 
will be most relevant to DDT in VCEs. From there on, the report 
is focused on a description and analysis of the detailed situations 
surrounding past intensive VCEs, including the Bunceﬁeld, Jaipur, 
and the Puerto Rico explosions mentioned above. This analysis be- 
gins by accumulating and describing “detonation markers,” which 
are objects that are deformed in a characteristic way by the deto- 
nation. A number of such markers have been determined recently 
in the post-Bunceﬁeld investigation. After that, the VCEs are dis- 
cussed using these markers and other available knowledge of the 
behavior of deﬂagrations, detonations, and DDT in order to get bet- 
ter insight into which combustion phenomena, deﬂagration or det- 
onation, are most likely to have occurred in the accident. When 
it is concluded that a detonation occurred, an attempt is made to 
identify the most likely mechanisms for causing it. 

In its essence, this paper is a revised and modiﬁed version of an 
internal report written for Shell Global Solutions [15] . The original 
report contained Appendices that described each of the VCE’s dis- 
cussed in considerably more detail. This Appendix is now available 
online for interested readers on the website www.arXiv.org . 

It  is  hoped  that  this  review  will  produce  insights  that  can 
be  used  to  understand  the  hazards  of  VCEs,  improve  risk  man- 
agement, and review control measures (in design, operation, and 
maintenance) and mitigation systems. Perhaps even more, it is be- 
lieved  that  this  review  will  show  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that 
detonations occurred in several accidents and thus improve aware- 
ness of the detonation hazard as a ﬁrst requirement for changes 
and new approaches to lower the risk and consequences of a VCE. 
Implementation of such changes could save human lives, maintain 
conﬁdence in industry, and reduce operational and capital cost in 
handling hydrocarbons. 

2. Mechanisms of ﬂame acceleration and DDT 

There are a several important concepts that should be deﬁned 
before this description of DDT mechanisms begins. First, there is 
the technical deﬁnition of an explosion, which is generally an am- 
biguous term,  but has been deﬁned as: “... any type of scenario 
in  which  energy  is  injected  into  a  system  faster  than  it  can  be 
smoothly equilibrated through the system. The result of this rapid 
injection  of  energy  is  a  local  pressure  increase.  If  the  system  is 
unconﬁned,  or  if  the  conﬁnement  is  weak  and  can  be  broken, 
strong pressure waves (shock waves or blast waves) develop and 
spread  outward,  traveling  considerable  distances  before  they  are 
dissipated” [10] .

The words ﬂame and deﬂagration are often used interchange- 
ably  in  both  common  language  and  the  combustion  literature. 
Here, we refer to a ﬂame as an idealized laminar, essentially one- 
dimensional reaction front propagating normal to itself, in which 
fuel is converted to product and heat is released. A deﬂagration, 
or a turbulent ﬂame, however, is a more complex structure con- 
sisting of a collection of convoluted and distorted ﬂame fronts. Be- 
cause of the large ﬂame surface area and consequent enhanced en- 
ergy release, a deﬂagration (or turbulent ﬂame) can accelerate and 
reach even faster ﬂame velocities. As shown below, a small, lami- 
nar ﬂame can evolve into a turbulent ﬂame, and this deﬂagration 
may evolve into a detonation, all due to the presence of conges- 
tion, conﬁnement, turbulence, and shock waves. 

The importance of shock waves in the descriptions that follow 
cannot be overstated. We will see that on the small scale, shock 
waves create scenarios in which ﬂames accelerate and DDT may 
occur. They also comprise the leading fronts of fast ﬂames and det- 
onations, and so they cause large, impulsive overpressures that can 
be the source of considerable damage. Shock waves are also the 
features that allow a fast ﬂame or detonation to reignite and thus 
to survive, even after it has passed through regions of inert mate- 
rials. 

The material presented in this section describes a number of 
different ways a detonation can be created once a turbulent ﬂame 
exists. We begin by analyzing an example of spark ignition in a 
closed, congested channel ﬁlled with a detonable gas mixture. This 
example  is  used  to  describe  this  sequence  of  events:  the  evolu- 
tion of a small ﬂame or spark to a deﬂagration, the development 
of shock waves, a transition from a deﬂagration to a shock-ﬂame 
complex (the fast ﬂame), hot-spot formation, and ﬁnally DDT. The 
formation of hot spots, which are gradients in ignition time that 
may subsequently develop into a detonation, is explained here as 
one way in which a detonation can be triggered. The mechanism 
by which a hot spot can make this transition is discussed in more 
detail below in Section 2.2 . 

The example is then expanded to discuss several other mecha- 
nisms that can trigger a detonation, such as energy focusing, direct 
initiation, and turbulence. Depending on the properties of the sys- 
tem, such as the geometry, amount of congestion, and type and 
concentration  of  fuel,  any  or  all  of  these  transition  mechanisms 
might occur separately or simultaneously in different parts of the 
system. They are, in fact, similar in one way: all rely on shock for- 
mation and shock interactions. This section concludes with a brief 
discussion of properties of detonations and considerations of the 
likelihood of occurrence of DDT in a hydrocarbon vapor cloud. 

Much of the material in this section is based on extensive the- 
ory, experiments, and numerical simulations carried out in the last 
ﬁfty years. In particular, we have used results from large-scale nu- 
merical simulations to help us understand existing mechanisms for 
DDT as well as to discover additional effects and pathways. The 
ability to do these types of simulations rests on the development 
of high-order, low-dissipation algorithms for computing ﬂuid dy- 
namics,  reasonable  models  of  chemical  reactions  and  energy  re- 
lease, and the availability of high-performance computing. Some of 
this has been summarized in prior papers [16,17] and a number of 
the papers contained in the volume edited by Oran and Williams 
[10] . Speciﬁc references to each of the simulations used to illus- 
trate the different points are given in the text that follows. As ex- 
plained in the text, the simulations that form the basis for the de- 
scription that follows have been repeatedly tested and compared 
to  experimental  data,  where  possible.  In  some  cases,  which  will 
be noted, they themselves are the basis for new experiments and 
tests. 

In the material presented below, most, but not all, of the dis- 
cussion is based on studies of conﬁned DDT. VCEs, however, are 
usually thought of as unconﬁned, even if there is ground below. 

Detonation ignition in conﬁned regions, however, is very relevant 
to VCEs, because the most likely location for DDT in a fuel facility 
is in a region that has some conﬁnement or obstructions. After it 
is ignited in this region, it can spread into more open areas. This 
is, in fact, the situation we have seen from analysis of actual VCEs 
such as the CAPECO event discussed in Section 5 . 

2.1. Overview of DDT in an obstacle-laden channel 

An overview of the evolution of a system undergoing DDT was 
shown qualitatively in Fig. 1 . The purpose of this section is to fa- 
miliarize the reader with the shock, deﬂagration, and turbulence 
interactions that cause the evolution of the deﬂagration phase to 
a detonation phase. These interactions are fundamentally the same 
in small or large explosions. What does vary are the speciﬁc fu- 
els and types of congestion, all of which lead to different speciﬁc 
events in which DDT can occur. 

A  curious  point  is  that  the  basic  DDT  mechanisms  described 
here  occur  on  scales  that  are  microscopic  in  comparison  to  the 
scale of the explosions that may occur in VCEs. This, unfortunately, 
does not make them irrelevant, but actually gives us a clue into 
how a small spark might evolve into a turbulent ﬂame which, in 
turn, could become a detonation. This, in turn, gives us some in- 
sight into how we might be able to prevent the occurrence of DDT. 
One approach to understanding the underpinning mechanisms 
of  deﬂagration  acceleration  has  been  to  examine  the  evolution 
of  a  small  ﬂame  after  spark  ignition  in  a  channel  containing  a 
ﬂammable gaseous mixture. The overview follows the progression 
shown in Fig. 1 : Once the gas is ignited, a ﬂame is produced, ac- 
celerates, and becomes a turbulent ﬂame. Then, depending on the 
mixture  and  system  geometry,  the  turbulent  ﬂame  system  may 
transition to one in which there is a detonation wave. This conﬁg- 
uration has been studied extensively experimentally (see, e.g., [18–
22] ) and by large-scale numerical simulations (see, e.g., [12,13,23–
25] ) in many laboratories and for many types of ﬂammable gas, 
system sizes, and channels with and without obstacles. 

An  example  of  the  deﬂagration-to-detonation  transition  in  a 
hydrogen-air  mixture  is  shown  in  Figs.  2  and  3  (extracted  from 
[23] ). These ﬁgures are taken from an unsteady, multidimensional 
simulation with a model for chemical reactions and energy release 
[23] . DDT is a problem for which the growth in the capability of 
numerical simulation has allowed signiﬁcant insight into physical 
mechanisms. The type of physical domain shown schematically in 
Fig.  2 ,  a  channel  containing  obstacles  and  ﬁlled  with  ﬂammable 
mixture, is the canonical problem setup used to study DDT. In both 
the experiments and simulations, the channel length and height, 
obstacle spacing and height relative to the channel size (the block- 
age ratio), type of fuel, and type of ignition all might vary. 

More speciﬁcally, Fig. 3 is a sequence of frames taken from a 
computer-generated movie of a numerical simulation of the ﬂame- 
acceleration process in a channel with obstacles and ﬁlled with a 
homogenous hydrogen-air mixture. This example illustrates many 
of the features of the ﬂame-acceleration and DDT process that are 
related to obstacles, conﬁnement, and the presence of shock waves. 
The important points here are not the speciﬁc fuel system, or even 
the speciﬁc geometry, but the acoustic waves, shock waves, and dif- 
ferent stages of the ﬂame and ﬂame-shock interactions that can de-

Fig. 3.  Results from a numerical simulation showing the transition from a small spark, to a turbulent ﬂame, to a fast deﬂagration, and ﬁnally transition to a detonation, 
which propagates through the system [23] . This particular simulation was done for a hydrogen-air mixtures in a channel 4 cm high with obstacles 1/2 the height of the 
channel (blockage ratio = 0.5). Times are given in milliseconds in the upper left corner of each frame. The two temperature scales, shown on the bottom right, are for burned 
and unburned material as noted. Obstacles are numbered. Symbols D1, D2, D3, D4, F1, and HS indicate hot spots (discussed in Section 2.2 ), failed detonations, and successful 
detonations (described in more detail in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 ). D4 indicates the hot spot that evolves into the detonation that ﬁnally dominates the combustion process in 
the entire channel. The simulations were obtained by solving the unsteady, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with a model for chemical reactions and energy release 
that was calibrated to conditions produced by a stoichiometric hydrogen-air gas initially at atmospheric temperature and pressure. 

velop. Many similar simulations and laboratory experiments have 
been done with other gaseous fuels, including, methane, acetylene, 
propane, and ethylene in air, and the results are qualitatively if not 
quantitatively similar. 

In numerical simulations and in laboratory experiments, obsta- 
cles in the ﬂow have two important functions. The practical reason 
is  to  allow  and even force  the  ﬂame  to  become  turbulent  more 
quickly,  so  that  DDT  may  occur  more  quickly  and  studied  more 
“economically.” The second function of the obstacles is to simulate 
the effects of ﬂame acceleration and DDT in obstructed ﬂows in a 
controlled environment that has features of obstacles in an actual, 
accidental explosion. 

The sequence of the frames in Fig. 3 proceeds from the top left 
to  the  bottom  left  frames,  and  then  resumes  in  the  second  col- 
umn  from  the  top  right  to  the  bottom  right.  The  physical  time 
for each frame, given in milliseconds (ms), which marked in the 
small white boxes on the upper left of each frame. The legend at 
the  very  bottom  shows  that  the  frames  use  a  dual  temperature 
scale, one for the burned and another for unburned material. Ob- 
stacles are numbered from the left wall. The absolute location of 
each frame moves along with the front of the combustion wave. 
More information about this particular simulation is given in [23] , 
which describes the numerical methods, physical assumption, and 

gives a more detailed analysis. An important point is that these 
simulations have been repeated with many different numerical al- 
gorithms on many different computers, and results have been com- 
pared to many experiments, so the conﬁdence level in the descrip- 
tion of the overall process is very high. 

The addition of a small amount of energy into the upper right 
corner of the system ignites a ﬂame that results in ﬂame propa- 
gation and expansion of the post-combustion products. This ﬂame 
quickly spreads after passing the ﬁrst obstacle. The initial expan- 
sion is followed by gradual ﬂow acceleration produced by expan- 
sion  of  burning  products,  which  push  unreacted  material  down- 
stream. The average velocity of the leading edge of the ﬂame starts 
at the laminar ﬂame speed, about 3 m/s, and then accelerates to 
about 400 m/s (slightly above the speed of sound in unburned mix- 
ture) by  ∼ 0.15 ms, and then to about 820 m/s at 0.65 ms in the 
laboratory frame of reference. Weak shocks initially produced by 
the spark ignition decay quickly, but then strengthen again because 
of the ﬂame acceleration that generates acoustic waves. The ﬂow 
and ﬂame acceleration are related to the increase in the total burn- 
ing rate in the system. 

Several  mechanisms  cause  the  burning  rate  increase,  most  of 
which are related to the growth of the ﬂame surface area and how 
this surface area interacts with waves in the system. Initially, the 

6 

E.S. Oran, G. Chamberlain and A. Pekalski / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 77 (2020) 100804 

ﬂame  surface  increases  as  the  leading  edge  of  the  ﬂame  propa- 
gates with the fast ﬂow along the centerline. This leaves unburned 
material in the lower part of the channel (as seen at 0.649 ms). 
The result is an extended “reaction zone” that spreads over several 
obstacles, but eventually stabilizes as the gas behind the leading 
ﬂame front eventually burns out. 

The surface area of the ﬂame increases when the ﬂame inter- 
acts with shear layers and recirculation ﬂow in wake of obstacles. 
As the ﬂame passes obstacles, it wrinkles due to the ﬂuid instabil- 
ities caused by the ﬂow acceleration and by shock-ﬂame interac- 
tions that trigger ﬂow instabilities. 

High  temperatures  behind  shocks  also  contribute  to  the  in- 
creased energy-release rate. As the shock and the ﬂame accelerate, 
the leading edge of the ﬂame remains at a relatively constant dis- 
tance behind the leading shock, and this can be seen, for example, 
in the sequence 0.771 ms to 0.989 ms. This is the regime of the 
fast deﬂagration or fast ﬂame . In the laboratory frame of reference, 
the ﬂame appears to be moving at supersonic speeds, the speed of 
the leading shock. We have often called this regime a “shock-ﬂame 
complex” to emphasize the coupling between the deﬂagration and 
the shock front. The transition to detonation occurs in some re- 
gion  of  highly  turbulent,  heated,  compressed,  but  unreacted  gas 
between the leading shock and the detonation. 

The particular sequence of event in Fig. 3 proceeds in this way: 
The  leading  shock  diffracts  over  each  obstacle  and  reﬂects  from 
the bottom wall, creating a series of Mach stems (stronger, curved 
shocks). When the leading shock collides with an obstacle, it re- 
ﬂects and produces a hot region behind the reﬂected shock. Some 
of these hot regions have the properties that of a “hot spot,” a re- 
gion that is able to undergo a transition to a detonation. There are 
a number of these hot spots marked in the ﬁgure: 

• D1 (0.815 ms, Obstacle 12), evolves into a detonation, but can- 

not survive the transmission through reacted material 

• D2 (0.906 ms, Obstacle 13), evolves into a detonation, but can- 

not survive through reacted material 

• HS (0.906 ms, Obstacle 15) evolves into D3 (0.960) but as seen 

at 0.989 ms, cannot survive as a detonation 

• F1 (0.960 ms and 0.989 ms, Obstacle 16) has decoupled into a 
ﬂame and a shock wave which is seen interaction with main 
deﬂagration behind Obstacle 16 

• D4 (0.996 ms, Obstacle 17) evolves into a detonation before it 
can interact with the deﬂagration, and so is transmitted into 
the unburned material as a detonation. 

The mechanism of hot-spot ignition is reviewed brieﬂy below in 
Section 2.2 . Here we just need to note that the properties of these 
spots, that is, the temperature, pressure, stoichiometry, and gradi- 
ents of these quantities, all contribute to whether a hot spot will 
evolve into a detonation or decouple into shock and ﬂame. The cor- 
rugated structure at the reaction front in the last frame (1.023 ms) 
indicates the complex shocks structure, the detonation cells, at the 
front of a steadily propagating gas-phase detonation. 

The stages in the evolution from deﬂagration to detonation for 
this reactive gas (hydrogen-air) and geometrical conﬁguration, as 
shown  in  Fig.  3 ,  can  be  related  to  the  stages  shown  schemati- 
cally in Fig. 1 . The slow deﬂagration stage is from the beginning 
to about 0.4 ms. The fast deﬂagration stage is roughly from about 
0.60  to  0.90  ms.  The  pre-detonation  region  here  starts  at  about 
0.9  ms,  and  lasts  until  detonation  ignition  of  the  whole  system, 
which  is  at  about  1  ms.  Beyond  that,  a  propagating  detonation 
forms. All of these interactions among shocks, ﬂame surfaces, and 
obstacles are typical of what happens when a turbulent ﬂame in- 
teracts with obstacles in congested regions during ﬂame acceler- 
ation and development to detonation. Thus for this particular sce- 
nario, we can redraw Fig. 1 to show the ﬂow and ﬂame structure in 
the various regimes marked on that ﬁgure. This is shown in Fig. 4 . 
As the reactivity of the gas and the geometrical properties of 
the system change, the time to detonation also changes. For ex- 
ample, for changes of the stoichiometric methane-air in a channel 
17 cm high, with a blockage of 0.3, the distance to detonation is 
more like 10 m instead of the 10 cm for shown for hydrogen-air, 

Fig. 4.  The details of Fig. 3 related to the stages of ﬂame acceleration and DDT shown in Fig. 1 . Figure is marked for both hydrogen-air in a small, 4-cm channel [23] and, in 
parentheses on the axes, for methane-air in 17-cm channel [25] .

the time to detonation increases, and the ﬁnal detonation velocity 
changes appropriately for the different fuel. Qualitatively, however, 
the  ﬂow  looks  and  evolves  in  a  similar  way,  as  can  be  seen  by 
comparing the results in [25] and [23] . 

There are additional details shown in Fig. 3 that are not shown 
on Figs. 1 or 4 . These include information about the ﬂame front 
interacting with obstacles, shocks, and shock interactions leading 
to hot-spot formation. In fact, there are multiple hot spots formed, 
but there is one main event that can become a propagating deto- 
nation that will run through the entire system. 

The  ﬁnal  detonation  waves  have  a  complex  shock  and  reac- 
tion zone structure: In addition to the leading shock wave at the 
front  of  the  detonation,  there  are  transverse  shock  waves  that 
start  at  the  detonation  front,  expand  upstream,  and  move  verti- 
cally  through  the  reacted  gas.  These  transverse  shock  waves  are 
characteristic of gaseous detonation and are an integral part of the 
process of detonation propagation. There are many other features 
that could be discussed here, but these are left to future text books 
and the many existing journal articles. 

The most extensive studies of the type shown in Fig. 3 have 
been carried out for DDT in hydrogen-air and methane-air gases. 
For example, the study of methane-air combustion and DDT, re- 
ported in [20,25,26] combines experiments in relatively large (1 m 
diameter)  channels,  intensive  numerical  simulations,  and  scaling 
analyses.  Throughout  the  remainder  of  this  section,  results  for 
studies  of  methane-air,  hydrogen-air,  and  other  hydrocarbon-air 
mixtures will be used to illustrate mechanisms of DDT. The rela- 
tion to the types of hydrocarbons that explode in VCEs is discussed 
in Section 2.7 . 

2.2. Flame acceleration, shock waves, and hot-spot ignition 

As shown in Figs. 1 and 3 , when the ﬂame accelerates to a cer- 
tain velocity, pressure waves are generated. When these waves in- 
teract with each other or with obstacles, reactive ﬂuid can be com- 
pressed, resulting in both temperature and pressure increases that 
lower the ignition delay time. When this process becomes intense 
enough,  it  creates  “hot  spots” in the  ﬂow,  which  are relatively 
small, local regions of very high temperatures and pressures. As 
discussed in detail below, at high enough temperatures, pressures, 
and gradients in reactivity, a hot spot may lead to a sequence of 
autoignition events that can, in turn, evolve into a detonation. 

The relations among shocks, which can be detected relatively 
easily  in  experiments,  to  autoignition  in  gradients  in  reactivity, 
which were primarily studied by theoretical analyses, to hot spots, 
which  were  seen  in  numerical  simulations,  were  discussed  in 
depth in a previous review [16] . This review summarized existing 
evidence showing that explosion centers, which were the site of 
DDT, have the chemical and physical structure of gradients in re- 
activity. It also showed how turbulent, shocked ﬂow can create hot 
spots that are prone to autoignition. Thus the review linked several 
apparently different concepts to explain where and when a deto- 
nation might be initiated. 

Here the “gradient mechanism” of detonation ignition refers to 
a spatial gradient in reactivity, which can be caused by gradients 
in properties such as temperature, pressure, composition, or sto- 
ichiometry. An illustration of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5 . 
Consider  an  unreacted  gaseous  fuel  at  ﬁxed  stoichiometry,  dilu- 
tion, temperature, and pressure, and let the autoignition time be 
denoted as τ c . Then if a hot spot has a critical length L c , and the 
appropriate  gradient  of  reactivity,  d τ c / dx ,  ignition  delay  time  in 
the hot spot generates “reaction waves” or “spontaneous waves.”
These spontaneous waves are not initially true waves, but phase 
waves of reaction, which, after they appear, seemed to be moving 
through the gradient at enormously high speeds. Each location in 
the gradient ﬁeld, however, initially represents an independent re- 

action site. Because the entire process is moving so quickly, there 
was not enough time for acoustic communication along the region 
of the gradient. When the process slows enough to allow acoustic 
communication, a shock wave forms and becomes a propagating 
detonation as it leaves the hot spot and propagates into unreacted 
background gas. The development of a spontaneous wave in a gra- 
dient of reactivity, and the subsequent transition to a detonation, 
is shown in Fig. 5 . 

As a result of explaining the role of hot spots (or gradients of 
reactivity) in DDT, the review explained a second important obser- 
vation: It is not the ﬂame front itself that undergoes a transition to 
a detonation, but the turbulent ﬂame creates the conditions that can 
lead to shock generation, hot-spot formation, and the transition to a 
detonation in the unreacted ﬂammable mixture. 

As in Fig. 3 , the turbulent ﬂame generates acoustic and shock 
waves as it propagates through a channel. Hot spots are created 
in unreacted gas that had been shocked repeatedly, so that it was 
substantially preheated and compressed before ignition. As a re- 
sult, hot spots are formed at temperatures and pressures signiﬁ- 
cantly higher than those in the background unperturbed gas, that 
is, in conditions for which auto-ignition times are much shorter. 
A typical example of a hot spot formed behind a reﬂected shock 
and its transition to a detonation is shown in Fig. 6 , taken from 
[10], which is extracted and enlarged from frames in the simula- 
tion shown in Fig. 3 . If the reﬂected shock is too weak, the con- 
ditions in the hot spot might not be favorable for a transition to 
detonation,  and  so  result  in  a  ﬂame  and  a  shock  that  separate 
quickly. 

A third observation relates to the shock-ﬂame complex that is 
formed in the evolution shown in Fig. 3 . This complex is composed 
of a leading shock, which has reached about half of the theoreti- 
cal steady-state Chapman-Jouguet detonation velocity, D CJ , of the 
unburned  material,  followed  at  some  fairly  constant  distance  by 
a turbulent ﬂame. This state is not a detonation, which is a very 
tight complex of a shock followed by a reaction zone, but a much 
more loosely coupled state. Here the ﬂame and the shock are sep- 
arated by a highly turbulent, repeatedly shocked gas. This complex 
is sometimes called a fast ﬂame or supersonic ﬂame . Fast ﬂames cre- 
ate high-pressure, high-temperature regions in which detonations 
might occur. 

The unreacted gas surrounding the turbulent ﬂame is extremely 
turbulent. Generally, it has been shocked repeatedly before a hot 
spot arises. These shocks have a range of strengths and come from 
any  direction  in  the  ﬂow.  An  example  of  this  ﬂow  is  shown  in 
Fig. 7 , taken from a study of DDT in stoichiometric methane-air 
mixtures. The nature of this kind of turbulence itself is a challenge 
and has yet to be addressed adequately [26] . One of the critical 
roles of turbulence in this process is to create the conditions that 
allow this transition in the fundamental nature of the propagat- 
ing front, the transition from a deﬂagration to a detonation to oc- 
cur. Feedback between the ﬂame, turbulence, and shocks created 
in the ﬂow are the key to creating these conditions. Research into 
how the different stages of the DDT process affects and is affected 
by various levels and types of turbulence is an important area of 
current research. 

Obstacles  (or  obstructions)  in  the  ﬂow  and  their  properties 
(such  as  material  strength,  ﬂexibility,  or  surface  roughness)  play 
important roles in the development shocks and turbulence in the 
ﬂow.  First,  they  provide  surfaces  from  which  shock  reﬂect,  thus 
changing the properties of the medium. In addition, they provide 
the added complication of boundary layers, which themselves may 
have a range of effects on the ﬂow, including, for example, acting 
like a nozzle that increases the central ﬂow velocity, or even pro- 
viding stratiﬁed heat layers that can themselves act as reactivity 
gradients. In a study discussed in some detail in Section 2.4 , the 
wall boundary happened to be one of the natural places for shock

Fig. 6.  Sequence taken from a computation of a propagating turbulent ﬂame in an obstacle-laden channel initially ﬁlled with a fuel-air mixture at atmospheric conditions 
at the moment of the transition: after a shock (A) reﬂects from an obstacle, a hot spot (or gradient in reactivity) forms and ignites near the obstacle (B). This produces a 
spontaneous combustion wave (C) that propagates into shocked, heated, unreacted gas. This wave eventually transitions into a detonation that moves into the ﬂame (where 
it becomes a shock) (D) and also passes over the top of the obstacle (E). Eventually this transmitted detonation will catch up with the leading shock, (F). Details are given 
in [24] . 

reﬂections in a heated, reactive medium, a process that caused in- 
tense hot spots. 

There have been both numerical simulations and laboratory ex- 
periments to determine under what conditions the mechanism of 
DDT might change as the blockage in the channel changes (see e.g., 
[12,18,19,23,24] ). Fig. 3 shows a case for which the obstacle block- 
age in the channel was relatively large. Then a well-deﬁned hot 
spot eventually either transitioned into a detonation that moved 
into unreacted material, or decoupled into a ﬂame with a shock 
moving out ahead of it, as presented in the detailed description of 
points D and F in Fig. 3 . As the blockage was reduced greatly, how- 

ever, the detonation arose through complex interactions of multi- 
ple shocks and boundary layers in unreacted material. This deto- 
nation initiation scenario is discussed further below in Section 2.4 . 

2.3. Transition to detonation by “Direct Initiation”

One  way  a  detonation  can  be  created  is  called  “direct  initia- 
tion” of  detonation  in  the  combustion  and  detonation  literature. 
Here it is referred to either as direct initiation or “energy focus- 
ing.” As shown in the discussion below, direct initiation seems to

atmospheric conditions. Top frame is temperature and bottom frame is pressure. Color bars across the top show two temperature scales, the upper for unburned fuel and 
the lower for burned fuel. The turbulent, unreacted ﬂow contains many shocks in both the fuel and product. Many of these, especially those generated at the ﬂame surface, 
propagate forward and strengthen the leading shock (on the far right). Other shocks interacting with the ﬂame front wrinkle the front more through shock-ﬂame interactions. 
This is discussed further in [25] . 

be an extreme form of energy focusing, and the term “energy fo- 
cusing” may give a clearer picture of what is actually happening. 

In  direct  initiation  of  a  detonation,  a  large  amount  of  en- 
ergy is deposited very quickly into a relatively small region in a 
ﬂammable  mixture.  The  energy  can  be  delivered  in  many  ways, 
including igniting a condensed phase explosive, igniting a differ- 
ent, more energetic gas-phase explosive, or ﬁring a high-intensity 
laser  into  the  fuel-air  mixture.  The  result  is  an  intense  explo- 
sion that initially creates an extremely complex state of matter far 
from  equilibrium,  and  the  system  is  overdriven.  This  highly  dis- 
turbed, high-energy, reactive ﬂow evolves to a steady ﬂow, after 
which it may be examined to determine if it has become a steady, 
propagating detonation. If it has, the mixture is considered to be 
“detonable.”

In experiments to determine the detonability of a gaseous fuel, 
there are two main indicators, or markers, that are used to deter- 
mine whether or not the system is able to support a stable detona- 
tion. One marker is the ﬁnal velocity of the leading reaction wave. 
If this wave reaches and stabilizes approximately at the detonation 
velocity, D CJ , there has been a transition to a stable detonation. 

After detonation initiation, the reaction wave velocity may be 
higher than D CJ , and this state is called an overdriven detonation. 
The overdriven detonation velocity decays to ∼ D CJ and propagates 
at that speed until the detonable mixture is consumed. 

A second marker that is deﬁnitive of a gaseous detonation is 
the presence of detonation cells. These diamond-shaped patterns 
are inscribed on surfaces by the leading and transverse shocks at 
the front of a gaseous detonation. These cells may be visible on the 
walls of the channel when there are soot coatings on the chan- 
nels.  In  the  case  of  GETF,  the  cells  were  visualized  by  covering 
steel plates with soot and inserting them near the channel exit. 
In general, however, detonation cells are not easily visible on other 
than specially prepared surfaces. Cells have also been visualized by 
open-shutter photography, which is sensitive to the increased light 
from ionization at shock triple points. 

In most cases, detonation cell patterns are highly irregular, but 
characteristic structures can be identiﬁed. At the rich and lean det- 
onability limits, these structures can be extremely large, as shown 
in [22] . When the numerical simulation shown in Fig. 3 ﬁnally pro- 
duced a detonation, there were horizontal lines across the front of 
the propagating shock front. Those lines are the transverse shock 
waves that are a part of the process creating detonation cells. Det- 
onation cells and their relation to fuel reactivity will be discussed 
further at the end of this section. 

Results  from  an  extensive  study  of  the  detonation  properties 
of methane-air mixtures in relatively large channels are shown in 
Fig. 8 . The Gas Explosion Test Facility (GETF), built at Lake Lynn 
Experimental  Laboratory  (since  demolished)  was  a  shock  tube, 
∼ 70 m long and  ∼ 1 m in diameter, equipped with diagnostics to 
deﬁne  the  position  of  the  shock  wave  and  the  ﬂame  front  as  a 
function  of  time  [20] .  The  experiments  proceeded  by  ﬁlling  the 
tube with a methane-air gas in a series of tests in which the mix- 
ture composition was varied in the range from fuel lean to rich. 
Fig. 8 b and c show measured pressures behind the leading shock 
and the shock velocity as a function of the percentage of methane 
in air. Theoretical values of these quantities are superimposed on 
experimental data. From data, such as those in Fig. 6 , it is possi- 
ble to ﬁnd the detonability limits for methane-air for this system, 
which were determined to be 5.3% and 15.6% for the fuel-lean and 
fuel-rich mixtures, respectively. 

One important point is that the amount of energy required for 
direct ignition and all of the physical and chemical processes that 
occur in the process, are essentially incalculable from ﬁrst princi- 
ples. It is generally estimated for a series of experiments such as 
those just described, which show detonation or no detonation for a 
given amount of energy input. This experiment becomes more dif- 
ﬁcult at the detonation limits where very large amounts of energy 
are required. Reference [22] discuss possible ways to extrapolating 
the minimum energy required for direct initiation based on known 
or more easily measured detonation parameters. From these exper-

studies. (b) and (c) Data obtained for front velocity and pressure behind the shock wave as a function of the stoichiometry in the channel. Black points are data, green lines

shows measured detonation limits as a function of channel diame- 
ter. Knowing how detonation limits of a fuel-air mixture vary with 
increasing system size gives us further insight into whether a det- 
onation can be ignited or sustained for large systems. 

It  is  curious  that  the  detonability  limits  are  approaching  the 
lean  and  rich  ﬂammability  limits  for  methane  air,  which  are  5% 
and 16% respectively. The ability of gaseous detonations to sustain 
themselves  at  lower  equivalence  ratios,  or  in  fact,  at  any  equiv- 
alence ratio, is that detonations have the additional multidimen- 
sional physical mechanism of interacting shock waves that contin- 
ually form reignition centers at shock triple-point intersections. For 
this reason, we might be able to assume that for very large sys- 
tems, the ﬂammability limits might give a reasonable estimate of 
detonability limits. This is another topic for further thought, anal- 
ysis, and measurements. 

2.4. Transition to detonation by energy focusing 

There is another way to deposit enough energy to create DDT, 
and that is by energy-focusing, which is part way between some- 
thing that can be calculated, as hot-spot ignition, and the types 
of  direct  initiation  occurring  in  the  experiments  described  by 
Figs.  8  and  9 .  Consider  Fig.  10 ,  which  is  taken  from  a  simula- 
tion similar to that shown in Fig. 6 , but with very small, widely 
spaced obstacles [13] . The new feature shown here is the region 
in  which  a  number  of  shocks  “accidentally” collided.  The  analy- 
sis  of  these  event  showed  that  the  local  energy  deposition  in  a 
very small region was large, hot spots were formed, and then a 
detonation  emerged.  Recent  theoretical  analyses  in  [27]  and  ex- 
periments  [28]  also  describe  and  show  this  type  of  detonation 
initiation. 

Energy focusing due to converging shock-waves brings up sev- 
eral  intriguing  possibilities  of  DDT  occurring  in  lower-pressure, 
less intensely shocked fuel-air mixtures. In such cases, the lead- 
ing  shock  might  not  have  reached  the  usual  speed  before  DDT 
and the deﬂagration might not coupled loosely as a fast ﬂame or 

Fig. 9.  Comparison of GETF detonability limits to measurements in smaller diame- 
ter channels as a function of 1/d, the inverse of the diameter of the channel. The 
limits expand with the size of the channel [20] . 

iments, however, we at least know whether a mixture is detonable. 
If the material is detonable, then a detonation can be created with 
much less initial energy input by a ﬂame acceleration process, as 
shown in Fig. 3 , if there is congestion, conﬁnement, or other mech- 
anism of ﬂame acceleration. 

There is another important point that can be seen from exper- 
iments. In general, a set of experimental tests done to determine 
detonability limits are performed in channels of ﬁxed diameter. It 
is known, however, that the measured lean and rich limits of det- 
onability expand as the experimental system size increases . The effect 
of changing the system size is shown for methane in Fig. 9 , which

luted ﬂame surfaces. The result is then a scenario that looks simi- 
lar to the focusing effect described above. This process is shown in 
Fig. 11 . 

The point here is that the transition location occurred on a very 
small  spatial  and  temporal  scale,  one  on  which  energy  was  re- 
leased so quickly in the turbulent environment that a shock was 
formed locally. This shock interacted with surrounding ﬂame sur- 
faces and created complex shock and shock-ﬂame interactions that 
led to more intense turbulence and more shocks. This resulted in 
a detonation. This is the type of energy focusing shown above in 
Fig. 10 for ﬂow in a channel with small obstacles, only now has 
occurred on an even more compressed time and space scale. 

The importance of this result is that it tells us that if the tur- 
bulence is strong enough, and shocks are somehow generated, a 
detonation could form. Another result of the simulations is that at 
some point in the development of a very turbulent deﬂagration, 
the turbulence can self-intensify. At that point, conditions leading 
to a detonation could occur. 

Now to tie this back to situations in which there are obstruc- 
tions,  consider  the  following  scenario.  Shortly  after  a  ﬂammable 
vapor  cloud  ignites  in  a  region  of  minimal  or  no  conﬁnement, 
the  turbulent  intensity  is  usually  much  lower  than  what  is  re- 
quired  to  generate  a  detonation.  Nevertheless,  if  there  were  ob- 
stacles present, such as grates, hardwood trees, or other types of 
congestion. the turbulence could intensify as a deﬂagration passes 
through these obstacles. 

Experiments  to  test  the  predictions  for  purely  turbulence- 
induced DDT described above have been started at several labo- 
ratories (See, for example, [29] ). Currently there is an indication 
that it is, in fact, a valid and actual mechanism. At the time of this 
writing, it is more certain for hydrogen and is not yet tested for 
hydrocarbons. 

2.6. Fundamental observations from scale studies 

The discussion above provided general information and under- 
standing of ﬂame acceleration and DDT. Results that are particu- 
larly relevant to understanding VCEs are: 

1. It  is  not  the  turbulent  ﬂame  itself  that  transitions  to  a  det- 
onation,  but  the  turbulent  ﬂame  creates  the  conditions  in  a 
ﬂammable mixture in which a detonation arises. 

2. The actual transition to a detonation occurs in a small tiny re- 
gion of space and in a very short time compared to times and 
scales characteristic of surrounding processes in the ﬂow. 

3. Fast ﬂames, deﬁned here as turbulent ﬂames loosely coupled 
to a leading shock, may be precursors to DDT. They do, in fact, 
create the environment in which DDT can occur. 

4. Shocks and turbulence are important and even critical for ﬂame 

acceleration and DDT. 

5. DDT can occur at some distance from the turbulent ﬂame, but 
in a ﬂammable gas that has been shocked and preheated, pro- 
vided the gas is suﬃciently reactive. 

6. If  the  turbulence  level  is  high  enough  at  some  location,  and 
mixture  is  reactive  enough,  conﬁnement  is  not  necessary  for 
a transition to detonation. (This has been shown for hydrogen 
and methane gases in simulations, and for hydrogen so far in 
experiments.) 

7. Once a detonation arises, it can propagate through conﬁned or 

unconﬁned regions containing detonable material. 

8. For large enough regions, such as, perhaps, in large enough va- 
por clouds, a detonation can propagate in fuel-air mixtures gen- 
erally considered outside of the detonation limits measured in 
smaller systems. 

Fig. 10.  Simulation showing the transition to detonation in an obstacle-laden chan- 
nel ﬁlled with a fuel-air mixture and for low blockage in the system. The obstacles 
are indicated by the small white squares on the bottom wall. The mechanism for 
transition in this case is multiple shock collisions leading to energy focusing at a 
location near the lower boundary. The arrows point to the location of detonation 
ignition. Details are given in [12,13] . 

shock-ﬂame complex and reached the typical high speeds before 
a hot spot is formed. What is simply needed is enough shocks in 
the system. The process, in fact, seems essentially stochastic, and 
might be related to the fuel, the particular conﬁnement or conges- 
tion. This is something that could be investigated on the labora- 
tory scale with other means of depositing energy locally, such as 
by lasers. On a large scale, it must be considered on a case-by-case 
basis. 

2.5. DDT In a turbulent ﬂame (unconﬁned, no congestion) 

Very intense turbulence can have a strong effect on ﬂame de- 
velopment, and this could even lead to a detonation [14] . When 
the  turbulence  is  intense  and  the  mixture  reactive  enough,  the 
ﬂame surface quickly becomes very large, convoluted, and densely 
packed in a small volume. As the packing becomes more intense, 
energy can be released in a relatively short time in a small volume. 
Then the pressure rises so quickly that it cannot be equilibrated by 
acoustic  waves.  There  is  then  an  explosion  that  generates  shock 
waves. These shocks interact in the unreacted gas between convo-

ditions on sides. Left: Pressure build-up late in the calculation before detonation appears. The highest-pressure areas, indicated by an arrow, are deeply embedded in the 
ﬂame. Right: Expanded view of small region inside the deﬂagration shows the development of a shock, again indicated by an arrow. Note the pressure scales for each ﬁgure. 
Details are given in [14] . 

2.7. How likely is a fuel-air mixture to detonate? 

This is an important question. Unfortunately, each type of sys- 
tem geometry, size, speciﬁc fuel and reactivity, spatial fuel distri- 
bution,  turbulence  intensity,  and  background  turbulent  intensity 
in the vapor cloud at the time of ignition bring up different is- 
sues and possibilities. Fortunately, however, some statements can 
be made, given the initial conditions. 

First,  consider  the  mechanisms  of  DDT  initiation  described 

above: 

1. Flame acceleration in congestion or (semi)conﬁned space occurs 
when a suﬃciently large and reactive ﬂammable vapor cloud 
encompasses a suﬃcient level of congestion. A weak ignition 
source  initiates  ﬂame  propagation,  which  accelerates  to  high 
velocity (either due to congestion of semi-conﬁnement) creat- 
ing regions of higher temperature and pressure. Once this hap- 
pens,  DDT  may  occur  [11]  due  to  hot  spots  (reactivity  gradi- 
ents), shock reﬂections ( Fig. 3 ), or shock focussing ( Fig. 10 ). This 
is the most likely cause of DDT in a vapor clouds in industrial 
settings. 

2. Direct initiation occurs due to very intensive local, purposeful, 
input of energy. This is not a likely event during VCEs, unless 
there is a strong initiator within the cloud. 

3. Energy focusing, which may occur for minimal conﬁnement or 
speciﬁc arrangements of obstacles, results when shocks, which 
are naturally generated in unreacted, shock-compressed gases, 
collide and locally deposit considerable energy. 

4. Strong-turbulence  initiation  might  occur  without  or  far  from 
obstacles.  In  this  case,  it  is  necessary  to  have  or  create  ex- 
tremely intense turbulence. Once a strong turbulent deﬂagra- 
tion is created in suﬃciently reactive mixture, it is able to self- 
intensify  as  it  propagates,  and  this  can  lead  to  a  detonation. 
These are results that have been shown in simulations and are 
now being tested in experiments. 

Thus, there are four mechanisms that may be differentiated, but 
these are not completely independent. For example, strong explo- 
sions due to venting are likely combinations of interactions of tur- 

bulence, shocks, shock focusing, and the creation of hot spots in 
hot turbulent mixtures. This is an area of current research. 

The next question is: How likely it would be for a speciﬁc mix- 
ture to detonate? One way to address this is to examine the det- 
onability of a mixture, that is, to determine the range of equiva- 
lence ratios ( φ) over which detonation has been achieved in well- 
controlled  experimental  conditions.  An  example  of  this  type  of 
study was given above for methane. The important point for VCEs 
is that if there is enough volume of ﬂammable mixture and enough 
congestion or conﬁnement, and if the mixture is within the detonabil- 
ity range, the mixture can be ignited by a weak spark and ﬂame may 
accelerate to such velocities that the mixture there can be a transition 
to a detonation. 

Then we need to ask: What do we know about the detonability 
limits of fuels? Based on the discussion of methane given above, 
we  have  seen  that  in  the  speciﬁc  conﬁned  system,  the  deton- 
ability limits for methane approximately correspond to equivalence 
ratios: 

• Methane: 0.55 < φ < 1.5 (or  ∼ 5% –16% volume of fuel in air). 

For hydrogen, these limits are broader (see, e.g., [30] , 
• Hydrogen: 0.5 < φ < 2.0 (or  ∼ 10% – 75% hydrogen in air). 

For most hydrocarbons, these limits have not been deﬁnitively 
determined for large systems, although there are some initial esti- 
mates [31] for lighter hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane and 
butane, 

• Light hydrocarbons: 0.75 < φ < 2, 

and for heavy hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane and decane, 

• Heavy hydrocarbons: 0.75 < φ < 1.8. 

We  know,  however,  that  detonability  depends  on  scale  and 
boundary conditions. For example, detonability limits measured in 
different conﬁgurations produce different limits (as shown by the 
limits discussed by [8] ). Because these limits are estimated, and 
the information is incomplete, it is a topic needing further analysis 
and study. Part of the confusion is due to the wide variety of ex- 
perimental conditions, such as conﬁned, unconﬁned, shape of the 
conﬁnement. Flammability limits are much better deﬁned.

13 

A Possible Route to Estimating Absolute Detonability 

Another possible way to assess detonability was suggested in 
[22] . They combined the data obtained in the Lake Lynn experi- 
ments, described above for direct ignition of methane in air, with 
a scaling law based on properties of detonation cells in measur- 
able regimes. From their analysis, they were able to “predict” the 
cell size for detonations in large channels. The interesting result is 
that the predicted cell size agreed well with experimentally deter- 
mined values. 

Then using the notion that a certain number of cells are needed 
to propagate a detonation, they could estimate a limit for a partic- 
ular size system. The important point is that really only one correct 
measurement of cell size was needed to then predict the entire 
range of cell sizes as a function of equivalence ratio. Whereas this 
method worked surprisingly well for methane, it has not yet been 
tested for any other reactive gas. 

2.8. Detonation transmission and survival 

The material presented above in Sections 2.1–2.7 was not meant 
to be a review of all properties of detonation ignition, propagation 
and quenching, which is a very broad topic now that deserves a 
full article in itself and perhaps several books. It has focused on 
mechanisms of DDT, and, as 16 most relevant to VCE, on mecha- 
nisms of detonation arising from ﬂame acceleration. We have ex- 
amined how ﬂame acceleration can cause background changes in 
which DDT may occur. 

Now we need to attempt to address at least brieﬂy the question 
of how, once a detonation is initiated in a conﬁned, partially con- 
ﬁned, congested, or highly turbulent fuel-air mixture, it can survive 
the transition to a region of less conﬁnement or obstruction, and 
thus it can propagate into the more open spaces of a vapor cloud. 
From a fundamental reactive-ﬂow point of view, this seems to be 
a topic that is less well understood than some of the basic mecha- 
nisms of DDT. 

The question then is: How do you quench a detonation? But ﬁrst, 
it is important to consider what is meant by “quenching.” When a 
ﬂame  is  quenched,  we  mean  that  the  burning  is  stopped  or  re- 
duced  to  a  state  where  it  will  stop  burning.  When  we  say  that 
a detonation is quenched, we mean that coupling of the reaction 
front and leading shock is disconnected to the point where it re- 
verts back to the stage of a leading shock wave followed at some 
distance by a turbulent ﬂame. This is a transition to a shock-ﬂame 
complex, of some system-dependent degree of coupling, in which 
the shock and deﬂagration are more loosely coupled than in a det- 
onation. 

The important point here is that quenching a detonation does 
not mean that the combustion is quenched. The burning or the de- 
ﬂagration  may  still  persist.  The  shock-ﬂame  complex  could  then 
be reestablished to transition to a detonation if there continues to 
be enough fuel present, for example, just as just as was shown in 
Section 2.2 . Alternately, if there is not enough fuel or the mixture 
is not detonable, the shock-ﬂame complex decays: the shock will 
decay and the burning will eventually stop. 

On  a  more  fundamental  level,  detonations  are  known  to  be 
quenched by a background change or ﬂow variation that disrupts 
the continual formation of detonation cells, thus disrupting the ba- 
sic propagation mechanism. The deﬂagration will persist as long as 
there is a ﬂammable fuel-air mixture present. There are, however, 
a number of ways that detonation cell structure can be disrupted. 
Here we will mention a few. 

• The fuel runs out. The most obvious case is when the detonation 
front enters into a region where there is no ﬂammable mixture 
present.  At  the  point,  the  deﬂagration  and  leading  shock  de- 
couple and the leading shock and combustion behind it even- 

tually  die.  Nonetheless,  If  the  shocks  propagate  ﬁrst  through 
a  region  of  no  fuel,  and  then  are  strong  enough  when  they 
reenter a region with detonable fuel, they can ignite the fuel 
and this can restart a detonation. How this occurs is geometry 
and fuel dependent, and so it is a topic that could use further 
study. 

• Detonation diffraction. This refers to the situation in which the 
detonation propagates over obstacles or into regions of differ- 
ent dimensions. This case has been studied intensively because 
of its consequences for safety. The important result is that the 
detonation will survive the diffraction process if it propagates 
into  a  channel  in  which  some  critical  number  of  detonation 
cells can exist. More detailed studies have shown that survival 
depends  on  the  presence  and  interactions  of  the  transverse 
waves that comprise the detonation front. Using water or sand 
are other ways to disrupt the detonation, but these alone will 
not stop a detonation from reforming unless the ﬂame is also 
quenched. 

• Change  in  the  reactivity  gradient.  A  related  situation  that  dis- 
rupts a detonation is propagating into a gradient of reactivity 
which goes in the direction from a stronger to a weaker deto- 
nation. Again, the important physics that allows detonations to 
survive are the transverse waves, the transverse waves struc- 
ture, and often the formation of transverse detonations in what 
seems to be a region of the separated shock and deﬂagration 
front. This is a case in which the detonation is very robust and 
usually reignites after it is disrupted (Praveen Honhar, private 
communication). 

• Turbulence. Another physical processes that can disrupt detona- 
tion cell formation is propagating into background turbulence 
of a scale on the detonation reaction zone size and with a high 
enough intensity to effect the leading shock wave. To have a 
sustained  effect  so  that  reignition  does  not  occur,  the  high- 
intensity, small scale turbulence must be sustained. This also 
is a topic for further analysis and study. 

• Thickness of the detonable mixture. If the size of the detonable 
mixture is below a critical thickness (typically on the order of 
three times the detonation cell size), the detonation structure is 
disrupted and the leading shock front becomes decoupled from 
the reaction zone. 

In summary, we ﬁnd that propagating multidimensional deto- 
nations are very robust. Once started, they are likely to propagate 
through all of the detonable mixture present. If disrupted, they are 
likely to reignite at some point if detonable fuel is in the path of 
the leading shock wave. Much of this, however, needs further study 
and quantiﬁcation. 

3. Explosion scenarios for VCEs 

From the  information provided in  Section 2 ,  we see that  the 
scales on which a fast ﬂame or a detonation develops are orders 
magnitude smaller than the scales of a reﬁnery, a chemical plant, 
or a pipeline. We also learned that congestion helps a detonation 
to develop, but once it is formed, it will propagate through the en- 
tire detonable fuel mixture irrespective of congestion in the back- 
ground. Most surprising, we learned that when the turbulence and 
shocks are intense and strong enough, transition to detonation can 
occur at some distance from any wall or obstacle in the ﬂow. This 
disparity  in  scales,  the  robustness  of  a  detonation  once  started, 
and turbulence-induced initiation of detonations present issues we 
must struggle with here. We now ask: 

How can we use the knowledge obtained from carefully controlled 
laboratory experiments, theory of combustion, and numerical simula- 
tions to interpret the events that lead to industrial-scale VCEs?

Fig. 12.  Pancake cloud of gasoline vapor formed before the Bunceﬁeld explosion [2] . 

To answer this, we must consider what has been learned about 
mechanisms of ﬂame acceleration and DDT in conﬁned or partially 
conﬁned accelerating ﬂames. 

An  intense  VCE  can  occur  when  a  ﬂame  accelerates  in  a 
ﬂammable fuel cloud engulﬁng an industrial plant or natural veg- 
etation (e.g., [1,5,6,8,9,11,32–34] ). These regions can be described 
as  “partially  conﬁned” or  congested  on  a  large  scale.  Fast  deﬂa- 
grations, that is, turbulent ﬂames generally preceded by a shock 
wave, may reach sonic speeds and overpressures of several atms. 
Then  before  the  ﬂame  accelerates  to  0.5  Dcj ,  a  detonation  may 
develop,  and  this  can  cause  extensive  damage  to  an  industrial 
plant or surroundings. In most cases, however, the leading shock 
of  a  fast  deﬂagration,  which  was  created  by  ﬂame  acceleration 
through repeated obstacles, will die rapidly once the deﬂagration 
has emerged from the congested region [9,35] . The deﬂagration de- 
celerates, and then it proceeds more slowly as a weakly turbulent 
deﬂagration, or cloud ﬁre through any remaining uncongested or 
unconﬁned ﬂammable cloud. 

Cloud ﬁres have characteristic velocities in the range of  ∼ 10- 
30 m/s in the frame of reference relative to the ground. This is slow 
enough that there are no noticeable overpressures developing. As 
discussed brieﬂy in Section 1 , in the very early stages of the ﬂame 
ignition problem, when the turbulent intensity is low and before 
there is no noticeable pressure buildup, falls under the category of 
a cloud ﬁre. (This was also discussed in Section 2.2 and shown in 
Fig. 3 .) 

If,  however,  a  critical  supersonic  deﬂagration  ﬂame  speed 3  is 
reached before the fast ﬂame leaves the congested area, DDT may 
occur  [9,14] .  Then  whether  DDT  occurs  or  fails  depends  on  the 
reactivity  of  the  fuel-air  mixture  and  geometrical  characteristics 
of the system. In some cases, DDT can occur once the turbulent 
ﬂame  has  left  the  congested  area.  In  other  cases,  DDT  can  oc- 
cur inside a congested area. Once detonation develops in the va- 
por cloud, it is a worst case scenario, as it is likely to propagate 
as a detonation through the remaining detonable cloud. Then, in 
milliseconds,  very  high  overpressures  of  16–20  atm  can  be  gen- 
erated with a detonation front traveling at around 2 km/s. Devas- 
tation  of  any  common  objects  in  the  path  of  such  an  explosion 
would be extensive. Following the Bunceﬁeld incident, for example, 
large-scale experiments [1,11] proved that DDT occurred in dense 
vegetation,  and  then  a  stable  detonation  propagated  throughout 
the remaining vapor cloud in unconﬁned and uncongested areas. 
Outside of the ﬂammable cloud, however, the overpressure decay 
was rapid and it depended on the shape and height of the vapor 
cloud. 

Conﬁned or partially conﬁned regions within a vapor cloud are 
also hazardous [8,35,36] . A deﬂagration exiting from a conﬁned re-

Technically, this speed is the Chapman-Jouguet Deﬂagration Speed, S CJ , which is 
∼ 0.5 D CJ . It is discussed in Section 2.5 and in most standard combustion textbooks. 

gion, often called a “vented explosion,” can dramatically increase 
the  likelihood  of  an  explosion  in  an  external  cloud  leading  to  a 
detonation. If the external cloud is inside a congested space, DDT 
is more likely. Even when there is no external congestion, if the 
scale is large enough, jet ignition by an explosion venting from a 
conﬁned region into the external unburned cloud can also lead to 
detonation [37] . (Vented explosions were mentioned brieﬂy at the 
end of Section 2.7 in terms how they might be initiated through a 
combination of several of the fundamental mechanisms described 
in Section 2.) 

When fuel is released continuously after an initial momentum- 
driven dispersion, and there is a signiﬁcant time between an ini- 
tial  vapor  release  and  its  ignition,  a  gravity-driven  vapor  cloud 
is  created.  If  the  fuel  vapor  is  heavier  than  air,  it  does  not 
rise. The result is a spreading, pancake-shaped, ﬂammable cloud 
that is more-or-less oval shaped and considerably wider than its 
height. 

Evaporation  from  a  liquid  pool  might  also  result  in  large 
ﬂammable  clouds  mainly  shaped  by  the  terrain  and  wind.  The 
height of such clouds depends on their vapor density compared 
to air, but usually is not higher than 2–3 m. 

When fuel releases are large and occur in relatively short times 
(that is, ten to a hundred seconds), and result from a high-pressure 
release  at  certain  orientations,  so  that  they  remain  largely  mo- 
mentum dominated, the result is a hemispherical cloud. The right 
amount  and  types  of  congestion  can  also  contribute  to  this,  al- 
though congestion is not necessary. The most important factors are 
the high momentum and direction of the release, which can create 
a turbulent cloud that is roughly hemispherical. 

An example of a pancake-shaped cloud that resulted from the 
gasoline spill at Bunceﬁeld is shown in Fig. 12 . These images were 
taken a few minutes before ignition. The air temperature at Bunce- 
ﬁeld was about 0 o C. As fuel droplets evaporated, the fuel temper- 
ature decreased (-9 o C), and this cooled surrounding air somewhat. 
The atmosphere was near the dew point, so this reduction in local 
temperature was suﬃcient to create a fog. This fog then contained 
both water and fuel mist and vapor. Considerable measurements 
and modeling were done by Chamberlain et al. [5] , Moen [8] , Bun 
[32] , Johnson et al. [38] , Atkinson et al. [39] . 

Starting with this pancake shape, we look at four practical ig- 
nition scenarios of a pancake-shaped ﬂammable cloud and conges- 
tion, such that the ﬂammable cloud extends outside the congested 
region. These are a prelude that will help us understand and cat- 
egorize the speciﬁc VCEs discussed in Section 5 . These scenarios, 
which are illustrated schematically in Fig. 13 , are: 

1. Deﬂagration of a large ﬂammable pancake-shaped cloud con- 
taining a congested plant with ignition inside the congestion. 
2. Deﬂagration of a large ﬂammable pancake-shaped cloud con- 
taining a congested plant with ignition outside the congestion.

benchmarked, as described in [41,42] . The computations in CAM 
are based on an effective source radius, R o , where R o  is deﬁned 
in terms of volume of the congested and ﬂammable space, V , en- 
gulfed by the ﬂammable cloud. 

Table 1 shows the effective source size in the ﬁnal column that 
is used in the CAM computation. Overpressures are based on val- 
ues  derived  from  experiments  such  as  Harris  and  Wickens  [9] , 
Mercx  [43] ,  For  a  stoichiometric  propane  vapor  cloud,  the  max- 
imum  overpressure  for  a  fast  deﬂagration  is  about  5–6  atm  for 
propane before DDT. This value becomes lower as the fuel reac- 
tivity  increases  [16,44]  (not  shown  here).  For  example,  ethylene 
reaches a critical overpressure of only 2–3 atm before a DDT be- 
comes possible. 

Of the VCEs discussed in detail in following sections, the one 
at Skikda will be shown to follow Scenario 3, whereas Bunceﬁeld, 
Jaipur, and Amuay follow the Scenario 4. The Texas City and Norco 
explosions are examples of Scenario 1, and Kuwait is an example 
of Scenario 2. These are discussed in [45] . 

4. Detonation markers and large-scale tests 

In laboratory and in controlled gaseous detonation tests, there 
are three markers that prove deﬁnitively that there was a deto- 
nation in a gas-phase fuel. First, there is the speed of the lead- 
ing  shock  front,  which,  for  a  detonation,  reaches  and  levels  off
at  roughly  the  ideal  Chapman-Jouguet  velocity  for  that  mixture, 
D CJ ∼ 1800  or  more  m/s.  The  second  is  a  high  overpressure  that 
follows the leading shock. For typical hydrocarbon fuels, this pres- 
sure can be as high as 20 atm. A third deﬁnitive marker, when it 
is present, is the detonation cell structure traced out by the very 
high  pressures  occurring  in  the  vicinity  of  triple  shock  intersec- 
tions that comprise the leading detonation front. These diamond- 
like patterns are observed, for example, when they are traced on a 
sooty wall or appear in open-shutter photographs, and usually spe- 
cially prepared surfaces are needed to observe them. (They have 
not been observed on other harder surfaces.) 

For detonations in actual, large-scale explosions, sometimes it 
might  be  possible  to  determine  that  the  wave  front  moved  at 
speeds approaching D CJ or that walls or objects experienced dam- 
age  that  could  only  have  been  caused  by  overpressures  much 
higher than a deﬂagration can generate. It is, however, very un- 
likely  (despite  a  number  of  interesting,  apocryphal  stories)  that 
detonation cells would be observed as a result of large-scale ac- 
cidental explosions. 4 

Because of the extensive large-scale tests performed after the 
Bunceﬁeld explosion, there are now a number of detonation mark- 
ers that can be used to help determine if a detonation occurred 
in  a  VCE  [6,37,46] .  The  result  is  that  we  can  now  use  speciﬁc 
forms of property damage (here cars, tanks, oil drums, instrument 
boxes,  oil  ﬁlters,  and  directional  indicators)  to  indicate  whether 
the  objects  were  in  the  path  of  a  detonation.  There  are  direc- 
tion  indicators,  such  as  the  way  in  which  poles  and  trees  have 
been  tumbled,  that  indicate  the  directions  from  which  detona- 
tions  were  coming  when  they  encountered  an  object.  There  is 
also the persistence of the strong shock wave, as indicated by the 
level on  a  Richter  scale  and  distant  glass  breakage.  These  large- 
scale  detonation  markers  and  the  tests  used  to  deﬁne  them  are 
summarized  below  from  the  more  extensive  descriptions  given 
in [33,34] .

One of the authors, ESO, went to signiﬁcant lengths (in 2010 and again in 2016) 
to check a story she had been told (by Gary Schott, then of Los Alamos National 
Laboratory, in 1984) of detonation cells appearing on the walls of a coal mine after 
a large-scale coal mine explosion. No living or documented source of information 
was found until the Lake Lynn Experiments using a methane-air gas, as described 
in Section 2 .

ing a congested plant with ignition inside the congestion. 

4. Detonation of a large ﬂammable pancake-shaped cloud contain- 
ing a congested plant with ignition outside the congestion. 

In Scenario 1 , ignition inside the congested region starts as a 
slow  deﬂagration  that  accelerates  rapidly  as  the  ﬂame  interacts 
with the turbulence created by ﬂow around objects. The deﬂagra- 
tion does not undergo DDT and stops accelerating when it emerges 
from the congestion. The remaining cloud burns as a cloud ﬁre. 
The  maximum  overpressure  reached  in  the  portion  of  the  cloud 
that engulfs the congested region depends on the size of the cloud, 
the level and type of congestion and the type and stoichiometry of 
the vapor. (As explained in detail in Section 2.) 

In  Scenario  2 ,  ignition  is  outside  of  the  congested  region.  A 
cloud ﬁre propagates through the ﬂammable cloud until it reaches 
the congested region of the plant. At that point, the deﬂagration 
can accelerate, but not transition to a detonation. The maximum 
overpressure that can arise is related to the size of the ﬂammable 
cloud. The maximum overpressure that can arise is related to the 
same parameters as deﬁned in Scenario 1. 

Scenarios 1 and 2 are the most likely scenarios for VCEs. 
In Scenario 3 , ignition inside the congested region starts a cloud 
ﬁre that rapidly accelerates through interactions of the deﬂagra- 
tion with the turbulence created by ﬂow around obstacles. The de- 
ﬂagration velocity then exceeds the critical value, and DDT occurs 
inside the congested region. The entire ﬂammable cloud could then 
detonate and contribute to the overpressure, which is assumed to 
occur. The VCE at Skikda [5,40] is an example of this type of ex- 
plosion. 

In Scenario 4 , ignition is outside the congested area. The ﬂame 
propagates as a cloud ﬁre at around 10–30 m/s, consuming part of 
the cloud, until it reaches the congested region where ﬂame ac- 
celeration occurs leading to a DDT. The detonation propagates into 
and consumes the remaining unburned detonable cloud. An exam- 
ple of this type of VCE are the explosions at Bunceﬁeld and Puerto 
Rico (CAPECO). 

The overpressures reached in each scenario are good measures 
of the hazard such explosions can cause. Estimates of the overpres- 
sures were made using the software package FRED ( Fire, Release, 
Explosion, Dispersion ), which includes models such as CAM2, ( Con- 
gestion Assessment Method ). FRED has been extensively tested and

Fig. 14.  Damage to cars placed inside a detonating propane-air cloud [33,34] . 

4.1. Damage to property 

The high pressures characteristic of fast ﬂames and detonations 
can cause substantial damage to property. Here observations and 
tests are reported that evaluate the effects of high pressures on ob- 
jects such as cars, oil drums, instrument cases, isocontainers, and 
storage tanks. This is mainly material summarized and extracted 
from the Bunceﬁeld studies [33,34] and put into the context of this 
paper. 

The value of the peak overpressure is not the only parameter 
to consider in assessing response of a structure to overpressure. 
Another often more important quantity is the impulse, which is 
the integral of overpressure over time. In fact, the most damag- 
ing case is that of a high overpressure that lasts for a long time. 
Generally, the time period over which a detonation remains over- 
driven is very short, hence the effect of this type of detonation in 
industrial plants can be ignored. For a stable, propagating detona- 
tion,  the  duration  is  much  longer  than  the  duration  of  an  over- 
driven detonation, but is generally much smaller than the duration 
of a deﬂagration. In general, it would be best to use impulse rather 
than overpressure to describe the mechanical response of a struc- 
ture to a blast. Nonetheless, it is simpler and there is more infor- 
mation available if we use overpressure to categorize damage, as is 
presented in this paper. 

Damage to Cars 
One of the most striking effects of large explosions on prop- 
erty is the way in which automobiles are destroyed with increas- 
ing pressure. Experiments in which cars  were placed inside and 
outside a propane-air cloud that was then detonated by igniting a 
small high-explosive charge [33,34] . Figs. 14 and 15 are typical of 
those discussed in [33,34] that recorded damage to the test vehi- 
cles. 

The tests show that the level of damage depends on whether 
the cars were inside the detonation region, where pressures and 
impulses are the highest, or outside the detonation, where the car 
is  subjected  to  a  lower-pressure  shock  wave.  Inside  the  detona- 
tion, measurements showed peak overpressures from 20–27 atm. 
The side of the car facing the direction of detonation propagation 
was driven inwards, and generally, the car was completely man- 
gled.  Overpressures  greater  than  1  atm  caused  some  damage  to 
cars placed at a range of distances outside the detonation, but such 

damage is small compared to damage caused by overpressure in- 
side the detonation region. 

Automobile wheels have small grooves into which the edge of 
the tire, the tire bead, sits. When the tire is inﬂated, the pressure 
in the tire keeps the bead in the groove. Debeading tires due to ex- 
plosions was studied by Haider et al. [47] , who concluded that an 
overpressure on the sidewall of the tire of at least 8 atm is needed 
to debead it. 

Damage to Steel Oil Drums 
Fig. 16 shows damage to steel oil drums that were inside the 
region  of  the  detonation.  These  drums  showed  various  types  of 
crimping which depended on how much liquid they contained. For 
steel drums placed outside the detonation, incident overpressures 
in excess of 3 atm caused similar damage, whereas incident over- 
pressures of 2 atm did not. In particular, the damage at 2 atm was 
only minor creasing at the top and sides when the level of liquid 
it contained was above 50% [33,34] . 

Damage to Instrument Boxes 
Fig. 17 shows the effects of overpressure on a small and a large 
instrument box. At incident overpressures of 1 atm or less, there 
was no effective damage. The doors may have been opened by the 
pressure waves, most likely in the rarefaction phase. At incident 
pressures over 3 atm but less than  ∼ 5 atm, distortion occurred 
to the front doors and, in most cases, to the sides of the box. At 
incident pressures of over 5.2 atm, the damage to the large box 
is comparable to the damage of the same box located inside the 
detonating vapor cloud [33,34] . 

Damage to Oil Filters 
Fig. 18 shows damage to an oil ﬁlter that was inside a deto- 
nation [33,34] . The ﬁlter shows crimping similar to that observed 
on ﬁlters in the Bunceﬁeld and Jaipur explosions. Experiments re- 
vealed that overpressure of more than 10 atm is needed to cause 
the damage level seen in on Fig. 18 . A detonation is capable of gen- 
erating such high overpressures. The only way in which a deﬂa- 
gration could produce such pressures is if the waves were some- 
how ampliﬁed exactly on the ﬁlter. This would require very high- 
pressure waves, as could have been caused by fast deﬂagrations. 
(See  Section  2.)  So  the  crushed  oil  ﬁlter,  when  combined  with 
debeaded  tires  (where  overpressure  should  be  above  8 atm)  and 
uniformly  crushed  tanks  (overpressure  above  8  atm),  are  strong 
indications  that  other  combustion  phenomena  than  detonations 
were not able to inﬂict such damage.

was around 1 atm [33,34] . 

Fig. 16.  Damage to standard steel oil drums placed inside the detonation, (photographs reproduced from [33,34] ). 

Damage to Iso-Containers 
An isocontainer, typical of that used for shipping, was placed at 
various distances from the detonation. No damage was sustained 
when  the  incident  overpressure  was  less  than  0.320  atm.  There 
was some minor creasing on the front face when the incident over- 
pressure  was  0.426  atm.  When  the  incident  overpressure  was  2 
atm and pulse duration about 5 ms, however, the degree of creas- 
ing on the front face was greater and the roof was damaged. This 
is shown in Fig. 19 . At the high pressures, the container was dis- 
placed and rotated through an angle of 27 o . 

Damage to Storage Tanks 
Fluid Gravity Engineering Ltd (FGE) carried out simulations of 
the incident overpressure and impulse on a 5 m radius, 8 m high 

storage tank inside a detonation [48] . This was done using their 
ﬂuid dynamics code, EDEN, and was reported in [33,34] . A typi- 
cal result is that the pressure loading on a large tank, typical of a 
detonation, was high on both the front and the rear surface of the 
tank. It was, however, 30% less on the rear surface. When the tank 
was placed just outside of the cloud, the drop in loading was about 
a factor of 5. 

A  similar  study  by  Venart  and  Rogers  [49]  concluded  that  a 
detonation  was  responsible  for  the  damage  at  Bunceﬁeld  stor- 
age  transfer  tank  601,  as  seen  in  Fig.  20 .  Uniform  crushing  of 
the  tank  was  simulated  using  the  Abaqus  Explicit  version  6.12- 
1 ﬁnite-element model. The damage computed is typical of that 
expected for a partially empty storage tank subjected to a deto- 
nation  propagating  around  the  tank.  The  minimum  overpressure

required to create this amount of damage was given as 8.5 atm 
with  a  detonation  wave  transit  time  of  3  ms,  estimated  from 
the  tank  diameter  of  6 m  and  a  detonation  speed  of  20 0 0 m/s 
[49] . Fig. 21 shows a similar, but less extensive, uniformly crushed 
empty  tank  in  the  VCE  at  Jaipur  [6] .  The  ﬁgure  also  shows 
crushed empty tanks at CAPECO in Puerto Rico (tanks 406 and 407 
were uniformly crashed and do not have any burn marks; tanks 
404  and  405  had  thermal  damage)  [5]  and  Amuay  (Venezuela), 
where  the  crushed  tanks  do  not  have  signs  of  thermal  damage 
[50] . 

Fig.  21  also  shows  a  close-up  of  the  empty  crushed  tank  at 
Jaipur  and  the  absence  of  crushing  on  a  full  tank  in  the  back- 
ground. There was also an internal explosion in the crushed tank,

and  this  can  explain  the  lesser  damage  compared  to  the  other 
tanks in Fig. 21 . In addition, the tanks at Jaipur were at the slight 
elevation, so that the ﬂammable cloud at that location was thin- 
ner and therefore inﬂicted less crushing and bending damage. The

tion opposite to the direction of detonation propagation. The con- 
clusion then is that inside the vapor cloud, there is a net reverse 
impulse on objects with respect to the direction of the detonation 
propagation. 

4.2. Directional indicators 

Experiments were performed [33,34] in which standing poles 5 
were subjected to detonations. Typical results, some of which are 
reproduced in Fig. 22 , show that poles were scoured in the direc- 

5 

Here we refer to all posts, tree trunks and other poles simply as “poles.”

There are, in fact, several scenarios that could generate ﬂow ve- 
locities with such negative impulses on poles. The ﬁrst is a detona- 
tion and the second is a fast ﬂame, both of which involve a strong 
shock wave that could be followed by a strong rarefaction lead- 
ing to  ﬂow  reversal. Other  scenarios could,  for  example, include 
the formation of rarefactions generated by localized explosions of 
unburned material surrounded by the deﬂagration region. The im- 
portant point is the generation of strong rarefactions. 

20

detonation in a vapor cloud in open space is the only explanation 
for inward deﬂection of items. 

4.3. The importance of broken glass 

Broken glass windows commonly result from shock waves and 
acoustic stress or thermal stress. It is one type of damage generally 
associated with accidental VCEs. Accident reports often quote the 
distances from the explosion at which windows were broken, but 
with no details about the type of glass, its thickness, or the types 
of shards created. In addition, there are usually large uncertainties 
associated with ground reﬂections and effects of atmospheric in- 
version layers on the strength of the blast wave at its source. For 
the present study, therefore, the overpressure threshold for win- 
dow breakage is assumed to be  ∼ 0.01 atm, as suggested by the 
Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) of the American Insti- 
tute of Chemical Engineers [51] . 

4.4. The effects of congestion 

Evidence from the Bunceﬁeld investigation suggested that the 
deﬂagration  accelerated  as  it  was  propagating  in  a  row  of  trees 
and hedges [33,34] . A subsequent ﬁeld test, using 2-m-wide, very 
dense  vegetation  (6.5  trees  per  m 2 ,  area  blockage  1.602 m 2 /m 3 ) 
produced a ﬂame speed of about  ∼ 150 m/s and no transition to 
detonation. Two other tests, in which a 4.5-m-wide row of vege- 
tation was used, resulted in detonations [33,34] . The tree density 
in these two tests was 5 and 1.5 trees/m 2 , corresponding to area 
blockages of 0.888 and 0.384 m 2 /m 3 , respectively. Thus, there ap- 
pears to be no simple correlation between regimes separating de- 
ﬂagration and detonation due to ﬂame acceleration through vege- 
tation. 

The  continued  ﬂame  acceleration  leading  eventually  to  DDT 
seems to be a function of the effectiveness of burnt gas venting 
through the sides and top of the tree line. A 4.5-m-wide row offers 
considerably more resistance to venting, and faster ﬂames would 
be the expected outcome. Taylor and Bimson [52] have shown the- 
oretically  and  experimentally  that,  for  ﬂames  in  a  vented  duct, 
the turbulent  ﬂame  continues to  accelerate if the  blockage ratio 
is greater than about 30%. 

Using vegetation as congestion, the area of blockage resulting in 
high ﬂame speeds was considerably lower than it would be with 
piping or other types of industrial equipment. One reason for this 
may  be  the  contribution  to  small-scale  turbulence  made  by  the 
many repeated small obstacles in the form of leaves, pine needles 
and small twigs and branches. This should be consistent, however, 

Fig. 22.  Marks generated on post (left) and tree trunk (middle) caused by the ﬂow 
induced behind the propagating detonation [33,34] . The picture on the right shows 
scouring on a post after the incident at Jaipur [6] . The markings are on the side 
opposite to the direction of propagation of the wave. 

Thus  when  all  poles  are  considered  together  over  a  site  that 
has been subjected to an intense VCE, the directions in which the 
objects bend or collapse could be indicators of whether a detona- 
tion has occurred. Indicators that are in open areas and that bend 
towards a common region are consistently found when there has 
been a detonation in pancake-shaped clouds [6,32] . It is important 
to  recognize,  however,  that  inward-pointing  poles  do  not  exclu- 
sively mean that a detonation has passed. Forensic evidence from 
directional indicators should be used in conjunction with other ev- 
idence. 

Nevertheless, in incidents where there is already considerable 
evidence  or  certainty  that  a  detonation  has  occurred,  the  direc- 
tional indicators inside a pancake-shaped cloud all bend towards a 
common point, whereas indicators just outside the cloud and be- 
yond all point away from the cloud. Fig. 23 , taken from the Bunce- 
ﬁeld [1] and Jaipur [6] investigations, well illustrates the point. 

Table 2 summarizes information on directional indicators. Det- 
onations in hemispherical clouds are less likely to deﬂect objects 
inwards. If the detonation starts in the center of the hemispheri- 
cal cloud, the spherically symmetric reverse ﬂows of combustion 
products compress the combustion products uniformly. Then there 
is little or no reverse ﬂow. A detonation starting off-center or at 
the edge of a hemispherical cloud results to greater ﬂow complex- 
ity behind the detonation, and it creates reverse ﬂows of combus- 
tion products over part of the cloud. The important point is that a

with more fundamental simulations of DDT that can now be car- 
ried out. 

As  shown  in  Section  2 ,  detonations  can  develop  in  fuel-air 
mixtures in conﬁned, congested areas. On a larger scale, experi- 
ments [9,53] have shown that propane-air mixtures can develop 
into  a  detonation  in  suﬃciently  large  spaces.  A  ﬂame  speed  of 
about 600 m/s using round obstacles, corresponding to about 6 atm 
overpressure,  was  reached  before  DDT.  In  ethylene-air  mixtures, 
the equivalent transition requires an overpressure of about 3 atm 
[43,54] . Ethane-air has been shown to detonate in pipework con- 
gestion [11,44] . These observations are consistent with the theory 
and experiments discussed earlier in Section 2 . 

4.5. Pressures from explosions leaving the ﬂammable cloud 

Extensive modeling and simulation effort s f ollowing the Bunce- 
ﬁeld explosion provided information about the overpressure pro- 
duced  outside  of  a  pancake-shaped  vapor  cloud  (See,  for  exam- 
ple, [33,34] ). From our knowledge of shock waves, we understand 
that overpressures outside of the cloud decrease rapidly with dis- 
tance from the edge of the cloud. Simulations performed using the 
FGE code, EDEN [48] , showed a correlation between the maximum 
overpressure outside the cloud and the ratio of cloud height to dis- 
tance from the edge of the cloud. From this work, an expression 
was derived to estimate the maximum overpressure applicable to 
clouds with a radius greater than 50 m,

worst instance. For a 100 m radius cloud, the discrepancy reduces 
to  a  factor  of  2  at  200 m.  Close  agreement  can  be  obtained  by 
changing δ and P s , but further research is needed to justify such 
changes.

For  smaller  clouds  (less  than  50 m  radius),  either  the  Multi- 
Energy  Method  or  TNT  Equivalence  was  accurate  enough  within 
the limitations of tests and simulations performed [33,34] . For ex- 
ample, simulations of  large pancake-shaped vapor cloud  detona- 
tions show that the external overpressure from a detonation would 
require objects to be within 20 m of the vapor cloud to experience 
a 1 atm overpressure, assuming a fully detonating pancake-shaped 
cloud of 3 m high [33,34] . 

An  earlier  analysis  [55]  of  the  decay  of  overpressure  from  a 
detonating  pancake-shaped  cloud  also  showed  the  rapid  fall-off
of overpressure with distance. They derived an expression for the 
overpressure P (atm) as a function of the distance r (m) from the 
center of the detonating pancake cloud as

where P s  (atm) is the initial overpressure of the detonation (as-

H (m) is the cloud height, and δ is the fraction of the cloud height 
that represents the blast source volume (estimated to be equal to 
0.1 based on hemispherical detonations). 

Rearranging this equation to obtain P in terms of distance from

There are a number of important properties of detonations that 
are complementary to or in addition to those described in prior 
sections of this paper. They are especially important to our discus- 
sions of the possibility of detonations in vapor clouds, and derive 
from both the material presented in Section 2 and the experimen- 
tal  work  that  came  from  the  large-scale detonation  studies  as  a 
result of Bunceﬁeld explosion studies [33,34] . 

First, small variations in fuel concentration from stoichiometric 
have little effect on the detonation overpressures within the cloud 
and the blast pressure outside the cloud. 

Detonations are robust. Once started, they can ﬁnd a pathway 
through a detonable cloud and propagate until the detonable cloud 
is consumed. A detonation can even survive propagation through 
regions with no fuel provided shocks are strong enough to reini- 
tiate a detonation in adjacent detonable cloud. This is because of 
the complex shock structure at the detonation front and how these 
shocks can reignite once they encounter the detonable cloud. Ad- 
ditionally, we know from experimental tests [33,34] that a detona- 
tion can propagate through relatively thin, 6 detonable clouds and 
ﬁnd a propagation paths towards adjacent ﬂammable cloud. Hence, 
once  a  detonation  is  initiated,  the  remainder  of  such  a  cloud  is 
likely to detonate and thus contribute to the overpressure. Deto- 
nations will stop propagating if the height of a ﬂammable cloud 
is below a critical thickness. This critical thickness of a ﬂammable 
layer is not constant for all fuels, but it depends on fuel type, its 
concentration, temperature and pressure. 

The  net  impulse  on  objects  that  are  well  within  a  pancake- 
shaped detonable vapor cloud acts in the opposite direction to the 
direction of propagation of a detonation. Close to the cloud bound- 
ary, where the reverse ﬂow will be shorter in duration, net impulse 
may act in the direction of propagation of the detonation [56] . 

Note the dependence of P on H / D and that P is only weakly depen- 
dent on R . 

A comparison of the Geiger equation with the simpliﬁed H / D 
expression based on the EDEN code is shown in Fig. 24 . The Geiger 
equation gives higher pressure by a factor of 2.8 at 400 m, in the

5. A review Of intense VCEs 

This section reviews fourteen actual VCEs and assesses the like- 
lihood  of  DDT  based  on  prior  discussions  of  the  structure  and 
properties  of  detonations  and  the  physical  mechanisms  of  DDT 
( Section 2 ), typical scenarios ( Section 3 ), and detonation markers 
( Section  4 ),  and  results  of  large-scale  ﬁeld  tests  to  evaluate  the 
cause of the Bunceﬁeld explosion ( Section 4 ). The results are pre- 
sented in terms of tables of properties for each event, including 
pictures to support observations and conclusions. When available 
and for most of the VCEs included, there is more detail and occa- 
sionally additional analysis in [57] . 

Throughout this section and in [57] , the software package FRED 
(Fire, Release, Explosion, Dispersion) has been used to compute es- 
timates of overpressures and other explosion characteristics. FRED 
consists  of  many  submodels,  such  as  CAM2  (Congestion  Assess- 
ment Method) and these have been extensively tested and bench- 
marked. All of the models in FRED are described in the FRED Oper- 
ational Guide to FRED 7.0 [41] . Publicly available reports using FRED 
or CAM software are also available, see Puttock [54] and references 
therein. 

Previous reviews of VCEs by Slater [58] and Lenoir and Daven- 
port [59] identiﬁed several intense VCEs involving hydrocarbons. 
Table 3 contains a list of these as well as a number of more re- 
cent events, such as Bunceﬁeld and Jaipur. The order of the VCE in 

the table and in subsequent discussions was based on the authors’ 
evaluations of the best to the least studied. The description of the 
Donnellson event, given in Section 5.14 , includes new information 
and puts forward a hypothesis for why the event did not cause an 
explosion. 

The VCE descriptions are based on photographs and reports that 
show the results of high overpressures, such as high levels of vehi- 
cle damage, debeaded car tires, crushed oil drums and oil ﬁlters, 
directional  indicators,  and  crushed  storage  tanks.  Supplementary 
evidence  came  from  damaged  buildings,  broken  reinforced  con- 
crete, broken windows, and Richter-scale measurements. In partic- 
ular, these criteria were important to the selection of events dis- 
cussed: 

• Reliable data available. 
• Windows broken at a distance of over 3 km from the explosion. 
• Richter-scale measurements greater than 2. 
• TNT equivalence greater than tonnes. 
• Type of hydrocarbon fuel. 

In  Table  4 ,  damage  indicators  characteristic  of  high  over- 
pressures  and  gas  detonations  are  shown  for  each  VCE.  Switch 
boxes and oil drums with damage estimated to have occurred at 
over 3 atm have been observed in open spaces and therefore in- 
dicate that a detonation wave could have passed. Such strong in- 
dicators are: the crushed oil ﬁlter (above 15 atm), combined with

debeaded tires (where overpressure is needed to be above 8 bar), 
cars massively damaged (section 4.1), and uniformly crusted tanks 
(overpressure  above  8  atm).  The  conclusions  that  a  detonation 
could  have  occurred  in  the  various  events  listed  in  the  table  is 
based on considerations of the types of possible combustion phe- 
nomena, the overpressures these can generate in open space, and 
the high level of damage as indicated by markers that require over- 
pressures greater than 8 atm. 

A striking factor common to most of these events was the rel- 
ative calm or low wind conditions at the time of the fuel vapor 
release. Combined with the fact that many of the released vapors 
are heavier than air, and there is enough time lapsed before ig- 
nition, the initial condition for the VCE was a pancaked-shaped, 
gravity-driven vapor cloud. Following the discussion in Section 3 , 
we deﬁne two types of vapor clouds: 

Type  A.  Flat  pancake-shaped,  gravity  driven,  and  stratiﬁed 

clouds. 

Type  B.  Approximately  hemispherical,  momentum-dominated, 

and more turbulent clouds. 

Table 5 gives supplementary information based on other deto- 
nation markers observed for each incident. One of the major con- 
clusions of the work performed here is the evaluation of whether 
DDT  occurred  and  how  it  was  set  up  (last  column  of  Table  5 ) 
based on the evidence gathered and explained in this report, in- 
cluding the detailed evaluations of each incident given in Cham- 

berlain et al. [57] . The Decatur and Beek incidents, included here 
at the bottom of the table, are the only VCEs, where there is some 
doubt as to whether a detonation occurred. In these cases, there 
is not enough information to make an evaluation, although these 
were powerful events. 

5.1. Bunceﬁeld, UK, 11 December 2005 

The Bunceﬁeld explosion on 11th Dec 2005 is the most-studied 
accidental, intensive, VCE in history [1,60] . As shown in Table 3 , 
∼ 300 MT of winter-grade gasoline 7 overﬂowed from a storage tank 
on a large storage site over a period of 40 minutes before igni- 
tion. The ignition most likely occurred when the electric ﬁrewater 
pump was being switched on Bunceﬁeld Major Incident Investiga- 
tion Board [3] . The area covered by the large pancake-shaped va- 
por cloud was estimated to be around 120,0 0 0 m 2 . The ensuing ex- 
plosion was much more severe than any considered previously in 
major hazard assessments of this type of facility. 

The investigation of the incident was overseen by the Bunce- 
ﬁeld Major Incident Investigation Board [3] . A separate Explosion 
Mechanism  Advisory  Group  [1]  examined  the  evidence  and  re- 
ported  on  the  severity  of  the  explosion.  It  concluded  that  addi- 

7 

Summer-grade gasoline has a lower volatility than winter-grade gasoline. The 
switch is made to reduce the unhealthful evaporation that increases with warm 
weather.

alent  radius  of  350 m.  Although  the  ignition  source  remains  un- 
known, the explosion is thought to have ignited in the northeast 
of the site as a deﬂagration. 

There  were  many  damaged  items  at  Bunceﬁeld  characteristic 
of a blast resulting from a detonation [33,34] . The trees and un- 
dergrowth  at  the  site  of  detonation  transition  were  torn  apart, 
whereas trees near the point of ignition were largely intact, indi- 
cating that the initial ﬂame had a relatively low speed, but then 
accelerated in the congestion created by trees and undergrowth. 
It has now been shown by many tests that the ﬂame continued 
to accelerate, and then DDT occurred in the vicinity of tree-lined 
crossroads at  ∼ 100 m from the ignition point. 

Parked  vehicles  located  in  open,  uncongested  spaces  showed 
signs of the high overpressures observed in the detonation tests 
described in Section 4 . Partially empty storage tanks not distorted 
by ﬁre, oil ﬁlters, and oil drums were uniformly crushed. As shown 
in  Fig.  25 ,  the  Fuji  building,  on  the  west  side  of  an  open  car 
park,  was  completely  destroyed  on  one  side.  Fig.  26  shows  evi- 
dence for a rapid drop in overpressure from the edge of the cloud. 
Directional  indicators  provided  by  trees,  lampposts,  fence  posts, 
and  a  displaced  skip  and  cars  all  pointed  inwards  towards  the 
most likely DDT location. A deﬂagration would have decayed into 
a cloud ﬁre a few meters into the car park and could not have cre- 
ated the extreme overpressures required to explain the destruction. 
Figs. 26 and 27 shows some of the many damaged items. Many of 
these items were located in the open car park and inside the vapor 
cloud. 

The Jaipur incident showed many similarities to the damage ef- 
fects at Bunceﬁeld. Trees, vehicles, oil drums and buildings were 
damaged in the same manner. Information about this incident is 
summarized  in  Table  7 .  Directional  indicators  within  the  vapor 
cloud pointed inwards towards a common location, as shown in 
Fig. 23 . 

The conclusion, then, is that the VCE incident at Jaipur experi- 
enced a detonation. The vapor cloud explosion could not have been 
caused by a deﬂagration alone, given the widespread occurrence 
of  high  overpressures  and  directional  indicators  in  open  uncon- 
gested areas containing the cloud. The overpressure damage and 
the  directional  indicators  show  that  the  ﬂammable  vapor  cloud 
covered  almost  the  entire  site,  as  shown  in  Fig.  23 ,  and  disper- 
sion  of  the  ﬂammable  cloud  was  limited  only  by  a  surrounding 
wall. The evidence from overpressure damage and directional indi- 
cators is consistent with a detonation propagating through most of 
the pancake-shaped cloud. The directional indicators point to the 
source of the detonation being in the pipeline division area in the 
north east corner of the site. The most likely cause of the detona- 
tion is a ﬂame entering either the pipeline area control room or 
the pipeline pump house, causing a conﬁned or partially conﬁned 
explosion that then initiated a detonation as it vented from the 
building into the remaining cloud. 

5.2. Jaipur, India, 29 October 2009 

In the Jaipur explosion [6,7] an estimated 10 0 0 MT of gasoline 
were released from a defective “hammer blind valve” at the base of 
a storage tank over a period of 75 min before ignition. The cloud 
dispersed over the entire 700-m by 600-m site, giving an equiv- 

This  VCE  in  Puerto  Rico  [5,64]  occurred  within  days  of  the 
Jaipur explosion. A gasoline storage tank overﬂowed for 26 min, 
resulting in a vapor cloud of 370-m radius that subsequently ig- 
nited. A site visit was made by one of the authors (GAC) at  ∼ 5 
months after the event. At that time, most of the damaged items

were intact, but vegetation had grown back at the east end of the 
site (called the bamboo area). 

The entire explosion was recorded on CCTV and thousands of 
photographs were taken just after the incident. Nonetheless, an in- 
terpretation of the course of events is not straightforward. Apart 
from lines of LPG vessels, known as “bullets,” there were no con- 
gested areas in the site. Evidence from both the CCTV and inter- 
nal explosions in huts containing electrical switchgear show that 
ignition  occurred  at  the  west  end  of  the  site,  probably  by  the 
switchgear. Then a cloud ﬁre propagated to the east and sped up 
as it burned around the LPG bullets. The ﬂame then slowed as it 
emerged from the bullet region, but sped up again a few seconds 
later as it propagated towards the east end of the site. Then there 
was a major explosion. 

The origin of the main blast, however, remains uncertain. A tri- 
angulation of a sudden build up and ﬂash of light, which occurred 
∼ 7 s after ignition, suggests a major explosion between two tanks. 
As explained in the Chamberlain et al. [57] , there is evidence that 
a detonation developed in the long pipes of the drain system be- 
fore exiting into and detonating the existing vapor cloud. Then the 
high-pressure detonation or fast ﬂame emerging from the pipe col- 
lided with outside articles and this led to DDT in the vapor cloud. 
The evidence used is given in Table 8 . This explosion is described 
in considerably more detail in the Chamberlain et al. [57] . 

5.4. Amuay, Venezuela, 25 August 2012 

For several days, oleﬁns were leaking from a pump on the plant. 
The operators assumed that the gases would naturally disperse in 
the prevailing winds. On the day of the event, however, the wind 
direction changed, so that a large vapor cloud formed across the 
site and surrounding area. Ignition was probably caused by a ve- 
hicle driving into the cloud. The greatest devastation was to the 
south of the plant and to the east in residential areas. Both of these 
areas had relatively little congestion. 

Buildings within the cloud were totally annihilated, and their 
reinforced concrete supports were ripped apart. Some broken fence 
poles  pointed  inwards  towards  the  reﬁnery.  Part  of  a  damaged 
footbridge also pointed inwards. The level of damage to vehicles 
in the explosion region is consistent with a detonation. Some stor- 
age tanks were uniformly crushed, and crushed oil drums indicate 
at least 3 atm overpressure in an open area. All of these obser- 
vations are consistent indicators of a detonating cloud rather than 
a  deﬂagration,  but  it  is  not  clear  where  or  by  what  mechanism 
DDT occurred. Ignition from a fast ﬂame or detonation (here called 
“jet ignition”) from conﬁnement or buildings leading to subsequent 
DDT in the external cloud is one possibility. Table 9 summarizes 
the event, which is discussed in considerably more detail in the 
Chamberlain et al. [57] .

5.5. Skikda, Algeria, 19 January 2004 

Of the collection of case histories of large-scale VCEs discussed 
in this paper, this is the only one that took place in an LNG plant. 
Table 10 summarizes the event. Sonatrach (Société Nationale pour 
la Recherche, la Production, le Transport, and la Commercialisation 
des Hydrocarbures) is a company owned by the Algerian govern- 
ment for the purpose of exploring the hydrocarbon resources of 
Algeria. Of its many operations, it ran Skikda, an industrial zone 
∼ 300  km east of Algeriers. Skikda had one of the largest oil re- 
ﬁneries in Africa until the large explosion in 2004 [40,67] . 

A  photograph  of  the  damaged  area  is  shown  in  Fig.  27.  The 
composition  of  the  fuel  released  in  the  Skikda  explosion  is  un- 
known, but it has been narrowed down to either LNG (methane) 
or mixed refrigerant as used in the proprietary PRICO process. As 
such,  it  could  contain  a  substantial  amount  of  highly  explosive 
and detonable ethylene. The equivalent fuel for this composition 
is propylene, as calculated by CAM2 model contained in the Shell 
FRED suite of hazard software [41] . 

The release rate is unknown, but eye witnesses reported that a 
visible cloud, which would be at least the extent of the ﬂammable 
cloud, traveled about 80 m towards the Maintenance Building. This 
would be consistent with a leak of liquid refrigerant from a 1 (cid:4)(cid:4) pipe 
break. Simulations using FRED “Pressurized Release” [41] predict 

that the release rate is about 15.75 kg/s, and that the dispersion 
distance to the lower ﬂammable limit of the mixture is 85 m. 

An operator noticed that the steam pressure in the boiler drum 
was rising to the point where the pressure safety valve was ac- 
tivated, which is consistent with the eye witness accounts that a 
vapor  cloud  was  developing.  The  operator  then  cut  the  fuel  gas 
supply, but the pressure continued to rise. An outside operator re- 
ported to the control room that he could see a large vapor cloud 
developing in Unit 40. Several witnesses saw the cloud developing 
towards a Maintenance Building to the west and towards Unit 30 
to the east. At this time, there was a small explosion in Unit 40, 
followed quickly by a second explosion, then a third larger explo- 
sion and ﬁreball. 

Photographs of the damage show that the Control Room and 
Maintenance Building were totally destroyed. Some reinforced con- 
crete supports from the remains of the Maintenance Building were 
displaced  towards  Unit  40.  Several  poles  in  the  open  space  be- 
tween  Maintenance  Building  and  Unit  40  and  a  tower  support 
were bent inwards towards Unit 40. This space also contained a 
few crushed oil drums, which indicates overpressures greater than 
3 atm. A large truck was damaged in a manner indicative of over- 
pressure  > 5 atm. A collapsed ﬂash drum and railings were drawn 
to the SW on Unit 40. These indicators, such as lamp posts in open 
space and part of the unit, were bent towards the origin of the 
explosion. Deﬂagration cannot cause such damage. The areas pro-

Cold LPG, or methane, or mixed refrigerant. Most likely mixed refrigerant. 
The release time is approximately 2 min, as per presentation by Achour and Hached [40] . The hole size is not known, 
but it is estimated as 2.5 cm to match the cloud cover. Estimated release rate is 15.75 kg/s. Thus the total fuel 
released is ∼ 2000 kg.

posed for the extent of the ﬂammable cloud and detonation are 
shown in Fig. 28 . 

In summary, the following course of events is proposed. A leak 
of mixed refrigerant liquid occurred from a pipe-break in Unit 40 
at a rate of about 15.75 kg/s for about 2 min forming a large vapor 
cloud. An explosion ﬁrst occurred in the furnace of Unit 40 after 
inﬂow of vapors into the furnace. The vapors consisted of mixed 
refrigerant, equivalent to propylene vapor, which vented into the 

cloud that had formed in approximately 2 min release time. The 
external cloud ignited, thus creating a deﬂagration in Unit 40. The 
ﬂame speed increased rapidly in the congested unit and generated 
around 3 atm over-pressure, thereby causing gross damage to the 
northern  end  of  Unit  40  and  adjacent  Unit  30.  The  combustion 
then underwent a transition to detonation in the mid-western side 
of Unit 40 and continued to detonate in the remaining cloud in

5.6. Brenham, Texas, US, 7 April 1992 

The explosion was caused when a large cloud of LPG escaped 
from an overﬁlled 1325 m 3 (350,0 0 0 gallon) salt-dome storage fa- 
cility in the Seminole Pipeline system [68] . Table 11 summarizes 
the event. A car passed into a cloud of gas accumulated in a gully. 
It was assumed that the car ignited the cloud. The car itself suf- 
fered damage typical of that caused by over 5 atm of overpressure. 
The explosion blew the car off the road and ﬂattened it. Three sep- 
arate blasts in quick succession were reported. The ﬁrst, most in- 
tense blast was followed by two lesser blasts. 

Despite the apparent lack of congestion and directional indica- 
tors, there are other strong indications that there was a detonation. 
For example, one side of the car was dented inwards, suggesting 
that it was on the edge of the detonating cloud. The car damage, 
torn tree trunks, building destruction, and Richter scale record all 
indicate an intense explosion and possible DDT or fast deﬂagration. 
The ﬁrst analysis of this incident in 1992 was when it was ﬁrst sus- 
pected that turbulence created by trees and vegetation could accel- 
erate a ﬂame in a manner similar to that caused by pipe obstacles 
in experiments. 

5.7. Ufa, Russia, 4 June 1989 

Failure of a 700 mm pipeline, pressurized to 38 atm and leak- 
ing for  ∼ 70 min created a very large vapor cloud in an  ∼ 2.5 km 2 
woodland on steeply rolling terrain. The pipeline contained mainly 
propane  and  butanes  with  small  amounts  of  methane,  ethane, 
pentanes  and  hexane.  Estimates  of  the  spill  range  from  2  to  10 
MT.  The  cloud  was  ignited  when  two  passing  trains  entered  it. 
Table 12 summarizes the event. 

Several accounts have been published on this event, but there 
are  inconsistencies.  Our  conclusion  is  that  there  is  deﬁnite  evi- 
dence of a detonation occurring. There also is some evidence that 
there could have been a ﬁre storm, although this is still a point of 

contention. Given the large volume of spill, there would have been 
a signiﬁcant amount of the cloud that was too rich to burn. Other 
parts of the cloud, particularly at the cloud edges, would have sup- 
ported premixed combustion and ﬂame acceleration through the 
woodland. 

One interesting observation is the pattern formed by large trees 
that  were  toppled,  some  at  their  base  and  others  about  3 m  off
the ground. The fallen trees indicate a high-velocity swirling wind 
from a ﬁrestorm burning the rich part of the cloud, but this can 
also  be  interpreted  as  the  damage  caused  by  high  overpressure. 
The  original  explanation  [69]  for  the  tree  fall  was  that  it  was 
caused by high winds generated in a rising ﬁreball. 

Flattened  railway  coaches  and  the  intensity  of  the  blast  that 
broke windows 15 km away both suggest that DDT occurred. There 
is also a sharp cut-off between the region of overpressure damage 
and both the thermally affected trees and the original forest, in- 
dicating rapid decay of blast at the cloud edges. This is consistent 
with the detonation of a ﬂat pancake-shaped cloud, as discussed 
earlier. 

5.8. Port Hudson, Missouri, US, 9 December 1970 

Full bore rupture of a propane pipeline created a large vapor 
cloud  covering  about  40,0 0 0 m 2  of  a  shallow  valley.  It  was  es- 
tablished  some  time  ago  [59,71]  that  the  cloud  detonated  after 
ignition by electric switching of a refrigerator in an outbuilding. 
Table 13 summarizes the event. 

The evidence for detonation came from eye-witness reports of 
the entire valley lighting up instantaneously with no observed sig- 
niﬁcant  period  of  deﬂagration.  Also,  all  broken  trees  and  utility 
poles pointed towards the blast origin at the outbuilding on the 
western edge of the cloud. There were no failures of trees or poles 
in the opposite sense away from the blast origin. This directional 
damage was very similar to that observed at Bunceﬁeld. The dam- 
age to trees and buildings was extreme, indicating overpressures of 
well over 1 atm. The detonation of the external cloud was initiated 
by jet ignition from the vented explosion in the building.

5.9. Newark, New Jersey, USA, 7 January 1983 

Overﬁll of a gasoline storage tank produced a large vapor cloud 
∼ 90 m  × 600 m  across.  This  cloud  can  be  analyzed  with  dis- 
persion simulations in FRED version 6.1 [41] . Ignition could have 
occurred [72] in the incinerator of a neighboring drum-ﬁnishing 
plant 300 m NW from the overﬁlled tank. Two smaller explosions 
immediately  preceded  the  main  one.  Table  14  summarizes  the 
event. 

While there is not enough evidence to conﬁrm that a detona- 
tion occurred, the severity of the explosion in a large open area 
and damage to storage tanks and ﬂattened rail cars is consistent 
with a detonation. It is likely that either ignition from a fast ﬂame 
or detonation leaving buildings to the NW, or from an open road 
trailer  near  the  point  of  ignition,  triggered  the  detonation,  in  a 
manner similar to that which occurred at Jaipur. 

5.10. Flixborough, UK, 1 June 1974 

The general view of the Flixborough incident is that a detona- 
tion occurred [73] . Buildings and vehicles in open areas within the 
exploding  cloud  were  either  annihilated  or  destroyed,  as  shown 
in Fig. 29 . Directional indicators within the exploding cloud, how- 

ever,  were  random,  but  this  can  be  expected  of  a  turbulent 
hemispherical-type cloud, Type B, described above. Table 15 sum- 
marizes the event.

This incident at Phillips Petroleum Chemical Plant is the largest

The presence of ethylene in the released ﬂuid suggests a high like- 
lihood of detonation in the highly congested area of the plant. Pho- 
tographic evidence showed silos crushed in a manner consistent 
with detonation and a high Richter scale measurement. Table 16 
summarizes the event. 

5.12. Decatur, Illinois, US, 19 July 1974 

A tank car carrying isobutane rolled down a track too rapidly 
during switching operations and slammed into an empty boxcar. 
Then  the  boxcar  coupler  rode  up  over  the  coupler  on  the  tank 
car and punctured the tanker. The puncture hole released liquid at 
about 176 kg/s and created a vapor cloud 80 0 m  × 120 0 m in the 
yard. Then after 8–10 min, the cloud was ignited by an unknown 
source. Table 17 summarizes the event.

The  VCE  was  intense,  crushing  vehicles  on  rail  trailers  and 
breaking windows over 5 km away. The calculations of the extent 
of  the  cloud,  using  FRED  software  [41] ,  matched  eyewitness  re- 
ports. The main explosion occurred about 300 m from the release 
point where the congestion created by rail cars was greatest. Al- 
though directional indicators are not very clear, there are some in- 
dications that rail cars and debris were drawn inwards towards the 

location of the main explosion. In addition, vehicles on the rail cars 
were crushed in a manner typical of high overpressures.

event. The result was a massive VCE. The explosion caused signif- 
icant damage and started ﬁres in the plant. Fourteen people were 
killed and 107 people were injured, three of whom were outside 
of the site. Evidence suggested that the release was due to low- 
temperature embrittlement at the depropanizer feed drum. It was 
thought  that  the  initial  fracture  had  occurred  on  a  40 mm  pipe 
connecting the feed drum to its relief valve.

For the Beek accident, it was very diﬃcult to ﬁnd any photo- 
graphic evidence for this 1975 event. This is similar to the situation 
discussed above for in Pasadena: There are reports, but the reports 
contain pictures that are not speciﬁc to our interests and not good 
quality. 

No directional indicators were recorded, but damage estimates 
suggest overpressures well over several atmospheres. This estimate 
is supported by FLACS simulations [77] , which assumed that the 
cloud consisted of stoichiometric ethylene mixtures and was about 
3.5 m high, produced 9.7 atm of pressure. DDT may have occurred 
as the ﬂame accelerated from the ignition point at the south of the 
plant through nearby units (number 2, 3 and 5). The occurrence of 
a detonation is supported by tank damage and broken widows up 
to 4.5 km away. 

5.14. Donnellson, Iowa, US, 4 August 1978 

An 8 (cid:4)(cid:4) LPG pipeline under approximately 83 atm pressure rup- 
tured in a cornﬁeld near Donnellson, Iowa. Propane leaked from a 
33 (cid:4)(cid:4) long split and then vaporized. The heavier-than-air gas rapidly 
moved through the ﬁeld and across a highway following the con- 
tour  of  the  land.  It  was  reported  that  the  propane  gas  eventu- 
ally covered  ∼ 303,514 m 2  of woods and ﬁelds and surrounded a 
farmhouse  and  its  facilities.  The  night  was  clear  with  high  visi- 
bility. There was a light N-NW wind of 2–4 m/s and temperature 
was over 10 C. After  ∼ 5 min, the propane was ignited by an un- 
known source. Three people died in the ensuing ﬁre, but no blast 
was reported [80] . Approximately 600 m 3 of propane spilled from 
the pipe.

, but this seems to refer to the burned area, not the extent of the propane cloud. 

The  main  question  about  this  incident  is  why  did  the  vapor 
cloud, which is reported to have been heavy in propane, did not 
explode .  Similar  incidents  (for  example,  Brenham)  also  produced 
large  LPG  clouds  covering  similar  terrain  and  a  signiﬁcant  blast. 
The type of terrain could account for the lack of blast, but another 
explanation could be related to the type of grain growing in the 
ﬁelds. If, for example, the grain were wheat rather than maize, a 
ﬁre could propagate through it, but not accelerate greatly. Wheat 
stems are ﬂexible, and they would bend in the deﬂagration instead 
of acting like a grate and causing the deﬂagration to accelerate. 

Apart from the apparent lack of congestion, there are signiﬁcant 
differences between the conditions of this spill compared to those 
that eventually detonated. The source of vapor originated from a 
turbulent release, initially at 84 atm. The wind was a light breeze 
rather than calm, and ignition took place early in the release when 
the cloud was still turbulent and not stratiﬁed. 

Table  19  summarizes  the  effect  and  a  detailed  review  of  the 

Donnellson incident is given in the Chamberlain et al. [57] . 

5.15. Other Intense VCEs 

The surveys of intense VCE events in the publications by Slater 
[58] , Lenoir et al. [59] and Marsh [45] contain a number of intense 
VCEs for which the evidence suggests that a detonation occurred. 
The lists in Tables 20 and 21 contain the result of their review and 
show that an additional nine events may have involved transition 
to detonation. The incidents have been chosen on the basis of type 
of fuel (paraﬃn or oleﬁn), amount of fuel exploded, severe building 
damage, and broken windows at distances greater than 3 km. The 
incident at Ludwigshafen involved dimethyl ether, which is close 
to ethylene in terms of the severity of explosion. This is included 
because photographs show distinct signs of a severe VCE. 

This survey of accidents in lists cited above [58,59] identiﬁed 
no  detonations  involving  methane  or  natural  gas  and  very  few 
VCEs involving hydrogen. The hydrogen explosions at Hull (1921), 
Nevada  (1964),  and  Watson  (1975)  were  air  blasts  in  turbulent 
clouds ignited very soon after release from containment. Lack of 
detail does not allow decisions to be about whether there was a 
detonation, but there is no doubt that these were intense VCEs. It 
seems that the natural buoyancy of these gases does not favor the 
development of suﬃciently large ﬂammable clouds in open space. 
Nevertheless, release of these gases in conﬁned surroundings can 
create the right conditions for powerful explosions, including det- 
onation. 

Although these are not discussed in the paper, there have been 
a number of explosions of hydrogen gas mixed with air in con- 
ﬁned or congested scenarios. For example, these occurred in Hol- 
land (1972), India (1977), and Sarnia (1984). These were chemical 

explosions, not nuclear explosions. Another example of hydrogen 
explosions were those at Fukushima (2011), where hydrogen deto- 
nations started in conﬁned areas (see, e.g., [81,82] ). Discussions of 
these and other hydrogen explosions can be found in [83–85] . 

6. Summary, Recommendations, and Conclusions 

It has been well known that large vapor cloud explosions (VCEs) 
could involve deﬂagrations, but it was also generally believed that 
VCEs  could  not  support  the  more  powerful  form  of  combustion, 
detonations. The Bunceﬁeld investigations and subsequent research 
represent  a  signiﬁcant  change  in  the  approach  to  understanding 
the evolution of events in VCEs. The conclusion that a deﬂagration- 
to-detonation transition, DDT, occurred at Bunceﬁeld, and that the 
detonation  propagated  over  a  region  of  ∼ 10 0,0 0 0 m 2  was  con- 
ﬁrmed by subsequent large-scale experimental studies. 

It is also known that fuel-air vapors in congested environments 
may lead to detonations. This was conﬁrmed by extensive labora- 
tory and large scale experiments and numerical simulations over 
the past twenty years. Finally, we know that once a detonation is 
initiated, it is capable of spreading as a powerful explosion with 
high overpressures and consuming the surrounding all of the det- 
onable fuel in a very short time. 

These  observations  naturally  led  to  the  major  question  ad- 
dressed  here:  Which  of  the  recent  and  historical  large-scale  VCEs 
were likely to also have involved detonations? 

6.1. Summary 

This paper ﬁrst provided a review of some of the fundamen- 
tal knowledge of the transition processes from a deﬂagration to a 
detonation (DDT). From this review, we learned that DDT can be 
initiated in strong, shocked ﬂow conditions, the actual detonation 
ignition sites are very small regions of space, and DDT occurs and 
establishes a detonation in a very short time. Although it might 
be extremely unusual and likely not possible for DDT to occur in 
completely open space. Nonetheless, the presence of any ﬂame ac- 
celeration mechanism, such as caused by congestion and conﬁne- 
ment, create conditions for shock formation and the development 
of a detonation. Once a detonation has formed, however, it is ro- 
bust. It can ﬁnd a pathway through detonable gases and maintain 
itself until the detonable cloud is consumed. Furthermore, a deto- 
nation can even survive propagation through regions with no fuel 
provided shocks are strong enough to re-initiate detonation in ad- 
jacent detonable region. 

Post-accident investigations of recent VCEs, such as those that 
occurred at Bunceﬁeld, Jaipur, and Puerto Rico (CAPECO), have al- 
lowed us to accumulate enough information to deﬁne a number of

“detonation markers.” For example, large-scale experiments eval- 
uated  the  possibility  of  ﬂame  acceleration  and  DDT  in  regions 
with tree congestion and pipe racks. Other tests were performed 
in which typical items exposed to an explosion, such as cars, oil 
drums, oil ﬁlters, and switch boxes, were exposed to a range of 
measured overpressures and impulses. These items, which are typ- 
ical  of  the  contents  of  industrial  plant,  provide  useful  markers 
that relate overpressure and impulse to the type of damage com- 
monly found after explosion events. Detonation markers generally 
reﬂect  the  ways  in  which  objects  respond  to  a  passing  detona- 
tion.  Generally  these  are  speciﬁc  types  of  damage  done  to  sur- 

roundings of property, but they also include evidence such as high 
Richter-scale measurements, which indicate that strong shocks oc- 
curred. The presence of such markers is evidence that a detonation 
occurred. 

Then by combining the basic information on ﬂame acceleration, 
detonations and DDT (Section 2), a general analysis of explosion 
scenarios  (Section  3),  and  descriptions  of  large-scale  detonation 
markers (Section 4), a series of 14 speciﬁc explosions were exam- 
ined to determine if a detonation could have occurred. Speciﬁcally, 
we considered:

dence lacking. 

13. Beek, Netherlands, 1975. Detonation might have occurred. 
14. Donnellson,  IO,  US,  1979.  Detonation  did  not  occur.  No 

mechanism for ﬂame acceleration. 

These explosions occurred at locations around the world from 
1970 to 2012, and for a variety of vapor fuels including gasoline, 
propane, LPG, ethylene, isobutane and cyclohexane. When it was 
concluded  that  a  detonation  occurred,  an  attempt  was  made  to 
identify the most likely mechanisms that caused it. Summaries of 
each  event  and  overviews  of  all  14  are  given  in  Table  4 .  Exten- 
sive additional details, explanations, and justiﬁcations are included 
in the Chamberlain et al. [57] . The conclusion of this review is that 
detonations in VCEs did occur, contrary to what was previously be- 
lieved. 

6.2. Suggestions for fuel-storage safety 

There are a number of ideas for plant design, layout, and per- 
sonnel training that are suggested by this review. There are in fact 
oﬃcial standards now and these should be and are followed. They 
do not, however, consider the possibility of a detonation. Existing 
standards assume that deﬂagrations could occur in congested areas 
of plants, but that these should decay rapidly as the ﬂame emerges 
from the congestion to an external cloud. The overpressure decay 
associated  with  deﬂagrations  is  deﬁned  by  the  size  of  the  con- 
gested area engulfed by a potential ﬂammable cloud, and not solely 
by the size of the ﬂammable cloud. If DDT or a detonation should 
occur, there is a strong possibility that the detonation will prop- 
agate through the remaining cloud present in open areas. As we 
have seen, the area into which the cloud spreads depends on the 
size and duration of the release, the local topography, and weather 
conditions. Thus the extent of the cloud before ignition cannot be 
predicted with any certainty. When a detonation occurs, the vol- 
ume that generates the very high overpressure is much larger than 
that generated by a deﬂagration. Hence, the damage is much more 
extensive. 

One  possibility  for  limiting  the  extent  of  a  ﬂammable  cloud 
could  be  to  have  a  vapor  fence  that  contains  the  cloud.  This 
may  have  the  advantage  of  limiting  the  spread  of  heavier-than- 
air  pancake-shaped  clouds.  At  Bunceﬁeld,  for  example,  gasoline 
vapors  remained inside  the  bund  for  a  considerable time  before 
spilling over into the surroundings. At Jaipur, the vapor cloud was 
contained  by  a  solid  wall  that  kept  it  from  leaving  the  depot 
area.  One  suggestion,  then  would  be  to  install  fuel  gas  sensors 
that would give the size of hazardous ﬂammable clouds in con- 
gested areas. This could, for example, be used to trigger remedial 
action. 

Other possibilities include various methods of active suppres- 
sion  of  shocks  by,  for  example,  water  spray  or  sand,  and  deﬂa- 
grations by, for example, water spray or selected chemicals. Con- 
siderable work has been done on this, although a comprehensive 
review is yet to be written. Direct suppression of detonations, as 
discussed  previously  in  this  paper,  is  really  a  multistep  process 

of  ﬁrst  disrupting  the  detonation  and  then  mitigating  the  sepa- 
rated  shock  and  deﬂagration.  The  timescales  for  this  would  be 
extremely  short.  Again,  this  is  a  topic  requiring  further  creative 
research. 

Where  environmental  screening  is  required  around  sites,  the 
exact use of trees and vegetation should be carefully considered. 
Current  information,  based  on  the  studies  performed  after  the 
Bunceﬁeld  explosion,  shows  that  vegetation  no  more  than  2 m 
wide led to ﬂame acceleration, but not to DDT for a propane-air 
mixture.  Any  further  increase  in  width  cannot  be  guaranteed  to 
prevent  DDT  of  an  engulﬁng  cloud.  One  common  feature  of  va- 
por clouds of heavier hydrocarbons when the cloud has has been 
passively dispersed in calm wind conditions is that the ﬂammable 
cloud height is typically below about 3–4 m. Thus, elevated veg- 
etation, such as large tree branches, would play little or no part 
in ﬂame acceleration whereas ground level vegetation should be 
cleared away or limited in width to less than 2 m. 

CCTV coverage of the entire site is important both to help pre- 
vent problems as well as being a diagnostic if something should 
occur.  This  coverage  allows  rapid  and  effective  response  to  un- 
usual behavior, such as the sudden development of a misty cloud. 
As CCTV records also help accident investigators, it is extremely 
helpful when clocks on the cameras are synchronized with each 
other. 

Drainage  systems  should  be  equipped  with  water  traps  to 
prevent  ﬂammable  vapors  from  penetrating  into  the  drain  sys- 
tem.  Drains can provide conﬁned tunnels in which deﬂagrations 
can  develop  and  naturally  accelerate,  leading  to  fast  ﬂames  and 
DDT. 

If possible, the use and quantity of more reactive combustible 
materials, such as oleﬁns and acetylene, should be minimized or 
more emphasis should be put into active leak prevention. Research 
would be necessary to correlate the amount of oleﬁns mixed in re- 
frigerants in, for example, LNG plants, with other plant parameters, 
such as the size and density of congestion. 

When new plants are designed, some consideration should be 
given to separating congested spaces to limit ﬂame acceleration. 
Unoccupied  buildings  near  or  within  process  units  could  have  a 
collapsible wall to prevent the build-up of high over-pressures in- 
side the building. This would prevent high-velocity jet ignition of 
an external ﬂammable cloud and the possible transition to deto- 
nation. Occupied buildings, such as control rooms, should be de- 
signed to avoid ingress of ﬂammable vapors where there is a risk 
of  exposure  to  ﬂammable  gas.  Even  simpler  is  to  have  a  vapor- 
tight building of one with a positive inside pressure so that the 
ﬂammable cloud cannot penetrate the building. 

Process safety training courses should acquaint operators and 
maintenance engineers with the hazards created by detonations. 
Maintenance procedures should increase the surveillance of parts 
of the plant containing the more reactive ﬂammable liquids and 
vapors. A suggested priority list of combustibles, in order of de- 
creasing  propensity  to  detonate  is:  acetylenes,  oleﬁns,  paraﬃns 
(propane and higher homologues), ethane, hydrogen, natural gas, 
the least reactive is methane. 

Finally,  if  there  is  an  accidental  VCE,  investigators  should  be 
called in before the site has started to be cleared. As shown by 
the detonation marker analysis, important information in terms of 
initial cause and event markers comes from looking at individual 
pieces of debris as well as the site as an entirety. 

6.3. Suggestions for future basic research in DDT 

Throughout  this  paper,  we  have  noted  topics  in  detonation- 
related research that merit further studies. Here we list a few of 
these  as  related  to  basic  research  on  the  full  cycle  of  initiation, 
DDT, propagation, and quenching.

• Fundamental  Mechanisms  of  Detonation  Initiation.  There  are 
some  very  basic  issues  in  deﬂagration,  DDT,  and  detonations 
that  need  further  clariﬁcation,  whether  it  is  done  by  experi- 
ments or simulations or theoretical analyses. These include, but 
are  not  limited  to  addressing  questions  such  as  exactly  how 
shock focusing works and whether it is predictable, the role of 
turbulence and hot, shocked materials, and the direct transition 
to detonations either through shock-turbulence interactions or 
shock interactions. These are all related in a fundamental way 
that needs clariﬁcation. 

• Detonability Limits for Hydrocarbons and Mixtures. What are the 
detonation limits as a function of system size? What exactly is 
happening at the limits? Can detonability for large system be 
approximated as the ﬂammability limit? 

• Quenching  a  Detonation .  How  do  we  do  this  effectively?  Are 
there active and passive ways that it can be quenched for long 
enough time for the burning to be quenched? When, besides 
when it runs out of fuel, can it be quenched? 

• DDT Prediction . Can we predict DDT for large Systems? Now, we 
can use simulations to model and give scaling rules for predict- 
ing DDT in moderate-sized (10’s of meters) systems. More stud- 
ies are needed that look at the effects of gradients in reactivity 
with and without obstructions, so that some rules and scaling 
can be found. 

6.4. Concluding remarks 

There  has  often  been  a  statement  that  DDT  cannot  occur  in 
VCEs because of the lack of conﬁnement or obstructions. In this 
paper, we have shown the importance of conﬁnement and obstruc- 
tions, although detonations in unobstructed space are not ruled out 
due to intense turbulence that may lead to detonation. The analysis 
of prior VCEs, however, indicate that DDT occurred in obstructed 
regions, and then propagated to less obstructed regions containing 
reactive gas. There is no mystery or contraction here, just a com- 
plex and evolving reactive-ﬂow in a complex geometrical system 
containing shocks and deﬂagrations. 

When the fuels are complex and not distributed uniformly in 
the background environment, when there are many irregular ob- 
stacles, varying conﬁnement throughout the area, and other small- 
and large-scale perturbations to the ﬂow, many possible “anoma- 
lies” can arise in the evolution of the deﬂagration, transition state, 
and the propagating detonation itself. Usually, however, it is possi- 
ble to decipher what happened in terms of what we know about 
explosions and DDT. Bunceﬁeld is an example: We learned through 
extensive  testing  that  the  extra  rigidity  of  hardwood  trees  was 
a  fundamental  key  to  understanding  how  the  deﬂagration  could 
be accelerated to create an environment in which DDT could oc- 
cur. Another factor which we see could cause anomalies in DDT, 
that is, cause it to occur at lower or different overall deﬂagration 
velocities, is shock focusing. If shock waves focus in detonable re- 
gions, they can create a local hot spot which might lead to DDT. 
These local phenomena may not appear as a global deﬂagration. 
Again these are special cases involving fuels, inhomogeneities, ob- 
stacles and conﬁnement that require further investigation. 

It  is  hoped  that  this  review  will  produce  insights  that  can 
be  used  to  understand  the  hazards  of  VCEs,  improve  risk  man- 
agement, and review control measures (in design, operation, and 
maintenance) and mitigation systems already in place. By showing 
beyond reasonable doubt that detonations occurred in several acci- 
dents, this review is meant to improve awareness of the detonation 
hazard and suggest changes and new approaches to lower the risk 
and consequences of a VCE. Implementation of such changes could 
save human lives, maintain conﬁdence in industry, and reduce op- 
erational and capital cost in handling hydrocarbons.
