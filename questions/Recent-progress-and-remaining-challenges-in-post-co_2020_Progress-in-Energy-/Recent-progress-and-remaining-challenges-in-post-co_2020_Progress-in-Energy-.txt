The  emissions  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 )  and  other  greenhouse  gases  from  rapidly  growing  industries 
and households are of great concern. These emissions cause problems like global warming and climate 
change. Although various technologies can be used to decline the alarming levels of greenhouse gases, 
CO 2 capturing is deemed more cost-effective. The metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are proving to be 
effective adsorbent material for CO 2 capture due to their microporous structure. MOFs exhibit varying 
extents of chemical and thermal stabilities; hence, distinct MOFs can be selected for applications based 
on the working environment. In this article, thermal, chemical, mechanical, and hydrothermal stabilities 
of MOFs and adsorption mechanisms of CO 2  capture in MOFs were overviewed. Also, the approaches 
for enhancing the adsorption capacity and eﬃcacy of MOFs were discussed. Moreover, the utilization of 
MOFs to improve the separation eﬃcacy of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) is also discussed. Further- 
more, as the conversion of CO 2 to fuels and other useful products is a viable next step to CO 2 capture, 
therefore, recent progress in the utilization of MOFs as catalysts for CO 2 conversion was also brieﬂy dis- 
cussed. Present work attempts to link the chemistry of MOFs to process economics for post-combustion 
CO 2 capture.

1. Introduction 

Carbon  dioxide  (CO 

2 adsorption capacity under low CO 

2 )  is  the  main  anthropogenic  greenhouse 
gas [1] , which is mainly emitted through various societal activi- 
ties,  like  the  burning  of  fossil  fuel  as  well  as  numerous  chemi- 
2  all over the world is emit- 
cal processes. About 44% of the CO 
ted from coal, oil, compressed natural gas (CNG), fuel burning, etc. 
[2 , 3] . Due to the rapid growth of industrialization, to meet ever- 
increasing human needs, the consumption of energy has exponen- 
tially increased. Currently, 85% of the total energy required is being 
produced by the combustion of fossil fuels that eventually results 
2 into the environment and thus increasing 
in the emission of CO 
its concentration [4 , 5] . The post-combustion CO 
2 capture methods 
belong to one of the most adapted approaches to supplement a 
retroﬁt option for the existing power plants [6] . This can be an im- 
2 emissions can 
portant factor because considerable increases in CO 
occur at some existing power plants. Post-combustion CO 
2 capture 
appears to be the most amenable strategy for integration with ex- 
isting coal-ﬁred power plants. Samanta et al. [7] demonstrated the 
potential of MOFs in recognition of novel and alternative materials 
2 par- 
which provide better CO 
tial pressure. Herein, we aimed to provide: (a) comparative analy- 
sis of applicable technologies for CO 
2 capture method at the power 
plant,  (b)  some  guidelines  to  researchers  in  selecting  the  better 
technology for reducing the risk of climate-related issues, and (c) 
some ideas about cost, energy, and eﬃciency of each method. As 
such, we mainly focused on the use of MOFs for CO 
2  capture as 
the main topic and theme of this review. 
There  are  various  methods  where  CO 

2  emission  can  be  con- 
trolled  by  increasing  eﬃciency,  using  alternative  sources  of  en- 
ergy instead of fossils fuel and developing techniques for carbon- 
capturing  [8] .  CO 
2  capture  technology  has  been  widely  investi- 
gated for the last couple of decades and around 40 main research 
projects have been proposed from 2004 to 2020 for capturing CO 
2 
2  captur- 
from  the  atmosphere  [9 , 10] .  These  developments  in  CO 
ing technologies at the industrial level are a major step towards 
a  sustainable  environment.  Various  carbon-capturing  techniques 
like membrane separation processes, chemical absorption with dif- 
ferent  solvents  (amines  [11–14] ,  nanoﬂuids  [15 , 16] ,  ionic  liquids 
[17–19] , amino acid salt solutions [20 , 21] , etc.), cryogenic separa- 
tion, electrochemical separation, and solid adsorption are used for 
2 from ﬂue and stack gases [2] . Adsorption techniques 
capturing CO 
are favorable techniques to capture CO 
2 from different gases. This 
technique has gained more attention because of its high eﬃciency 
and low requirement of energy [22 , 23] . 

The  emerging  metal-organic  frameworks  (MOFs)  based  mate- 
rials are considered effective adsorbents for CO 
2  adsorption with 
large surface areas, and a wide variety of structures, compositions, 
high porosity, and large void volumes for storage [24–30] . MOFs 
have  a  three-dimensional  (3D)  microporous  crystalline  structure,

made of metal-ligand networks [29 , 31–34 ]. There is a central metal 
atom to which ligands are attached. The central metal atom and 
ligands are linked by coordinate bonds [35 , 36] . Due to coordinate 
bonds, MOFs are also known as coordination networks or coordi- 
nation polymers [23] . In synthetic MOFs, the pore size and chan- 
nels are up to nanometers and angstrom [30 , 37 , 38] . These pores

Besides, an increase in CO 

2 level up to 2500 ppm – due to the 
2  human −1  day −1  [39] – in 
human breathing of approx. 1 kg CO 
indoors or enclosed environments such as submarines and space 
stations can have deadly implications due to the diminished cog- 
nitive ability, basic strategy, and initiative [40] . In that regard, CO 
2 
sequestration through MOFs is deemed as an effective solution for 
2 from the enclosed environments [41] . However, 
the removal of CO 
it is essential to choose a MOF that displays high CO 
2  uptake at 
low pressures to facilitate an effective capture process for enclosed 
localities. Darunte et al. [42] validated the utility of polyethylen- 
2 capture. The adsorp- 
imine (PEI)-implanted MIL-101 for dilute CO 
tion  capacity  of  1.0  mmol  g −1  at  400  ppm.  Moreover,  CO 
2  sep- 
aration from eﬄuent  gas  of  power plants – to  comply  with  en- 
vironmental regulation – and its storage in underground wells or 
conversion to useful products is also a foreseeable future. Besides 
2 capture, MOFs are also being used in other 
their application in CO 
applications like catalytic conversion of CO 
2 , hydrogen and other 
gases storage, sensing of volatile organic compounds, puriﬁcation, 
and  separation  of  various  gases  as  shown  in  Fig.  1  [43–45] .  As 
mentioned earlier, MOFs are very effective adsorbent materials for 
2 capturing due to the microporous structure; their commercial

utilization is still very limited due to their instability in different 
solutions. 

Various literature is  available covering the comprehensive re- 
view  of  CO 
2  capture  from  ﬂue  gases  through  different  methods 
including MOFs [2 , 4 , 9 , 46 , 47] . MOFs due to their distinctive prop- 
erties  of  ultrahigh  porosity  and  surface  area,  tunable  pore  size 
and geometry, and versatile modiﬁcations have been reviewed by 
2  capture  [48–53] .  For  instance,  Sum- 
several  researchers  for  CO 
ida et al. [54] comprehensively reviewed the utilization of MOFs 
in pre-combustion, oxy-fuel combustion and post-combustion cap- 
ture. Trickett et al. [55] discussed the chemistry of MOF to enhance 
the catalytic and carbon capture performance of MOFs. Hu et al.

[56] presented the process design and evaluation of CO 
by MOFs from an engineering point of view. Ding et al. [57] re- 
ported a comprehensive account of synthesis and design of MOF- 
based materials including composites and derivatives of MOFs for 
CO

tional  and  experimental  studies  for  CO 
The present work is a focused account of the current progress in 
post-combustion CO 
2 capture, separation and catalytic conversion 
by utilizing MOFs. Moreover, a detailed analysis of recent devel- 
opments in the stability of MOFs and its link to post-combustion 
CO 
2  capture  is  also  provided.  The  current  work  is  aimed  to  re- 
view the different stabilities of MOFs (thermal, chemical, mechan- 
ical  and  hydrothermal)  so  that  current  challenges  can  be  iden- 
tiﬁed  and  addressed  in  the  future.  The  strategies  for  enhancing 
2  in MOFs including the ﬁxation of 
the adsorption capacity of CO 
pore  size  and  shape,  incorporation  of  functional  groups,  utiliza- 
tion  in  mixed  matrix  membranes  (MMMs),  introduction  of  het- 
erocyclic  ligands,  and  ﬂuorination  were  discussed.  Moreover,  as 
2  to  fuels  or  other  useful  sub- 
reduction  and  conversion  of  CO

stances  is  a  viable  next  step  to  CO 
developments  in  utilization  of  MOFs  as  catalysts  for  CO 
2  reduc- 
tion  and  conversion  technologies  are  also  reviewed.  In  addition, 
we tried to link the chemistry of MOFs to process economics for 
post-combustion  CO 
2  capture.  Our  work  attempts  to  merge  the 
concepts  of  material  science,  molecular  chemistry  and  engineer- 
ing  for  the  development  and  use  of  MOFs  in  post-combustion 
CO 

2 capture. 

2. MOFs in carbon capture processes 

Oxy-fuel  combustion  capture,  pre-combustion  capture,  and 
2  capture 
post-combustion capture are the key approaches for CO 
2  emissions  from  fuel  combustion 
by  MOFs  to  mitigate  the  CO 
2  capture approach is essen- 
power plants. The adoption of a CO 
2  input 
tially  based  on  its  merits  and  shortcomings,  and  the  CO 
conditions such as the concentration or partial pressure of CO 
2 in 
the ﬂue gas [54 , 58–60 ]. The oxy-fuel combustion can be employed 
to new-built power plants whereas pre-combustion capture is ap- 
propriate for gasiﬁcation plants [58] . However, direct fuel combus- 
tion takes place in the boiler at all conventional coal-ﬁred power 
for power generation. Therefore, post-combustion carbon capture 
is favored for retroﬁtting of existing power plants. Fig. 2 shows the 
CO 
2 capture schemes. The description of each scheme is given in 
the subsequent sections. 

2.1. Oxy-combustion CO 2 capture 

Oxyfuel combustion has enticed a lot of interest in power gen- 
eration  as  it  requires  pure  oxygen  rather  than  air  for  combus- 
2 -free combustion atmosphere entails a ﬂue gas mainly 
tion. This N 
containing concentrated CO 
2  and water vapors for easier separa- 
tion. CO 
2 capture is not required in oxy-combustion as puriﬁcation 
can be easily achieved by condensation of water vapors. However, 
2  selectivity  due  to  the  very 
MOFs  inherently  exhibit  poor  O 

2 /N 

similar nature of these molecules as the selectivity of MOFs mainly 
comes  from  diversity  in  polarizabilities  of  competing  molecules 
and differences in quadruple moments [54] . Therefore, enrichment 
of low adsorption selectivity of O 
2 in MOFs is required to 
produce high capacity MOF materials for oxyfuel combustion cap- 
ture. Also, the production of pure O 
2 for this process results in a 
high cost for this capturing technology, which inhibits its applica- 
tions [56 , 59 , 61 , 62] .

2.2. Pre-combustion CO 2 capture 

2 and CO 

Pre-combustion  CO 

2  capture  involves  the  conversion  of  fossil 
2  and  CO)  followed  by  water–gas 
fuel  to  syngas  (a  mixture  of  H 
2 before combus- 
shift reaction to result in a mixture of H 
2 from the decarbonized fuels is separated using 
tion [59] . The CO 
high pressure (5–40 bar) gas mixture to result in zero CO 
2 emis- 
sion in the successive combustion steps [54 , 60] . The higher compo- 
nent pressure and concentrations make the pre-combustion easier 
and energy-eﬃcient which could reduce the energy penalty to ap- 
proximately 10–16%. However, the pre-combustion gas stream also 
contains impurities having a relatively low aﬃnity towards MOF 
4 .  The  release  of  these  gases  during  the  re- 
such  as  CO  and  CH 
2  is of major concern due to the greenhouse effect of 
moval of H 
CH 
2 S in trace amounts 
also  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the  stability  of  MOFs  [54 , 63] .  Be- 
sides, high-temperature requirements, low eﬃciency and high cost 
of  the  pre-combustion  capture  process  make  it  a  hard  choice 
[62] .

2.3. Post-combustion CO 2 capture 

Post-combustion technique is commonly used to sequester CO 
2 
from  the  ﬂue  gas  through  MOFs  after  fuels  have  completely 
burned.  This  scheme  deals  with  a  considerable  amount  of  CO 
2 
from ﬂue gas streams after the combustion of fossil fuels and other 
2  in this process 
carbonaceous materials. The concentration of CO 
is less than 15% which is much less than that for pre-combustion 
and  oxy-fuel  combustion  and  as  a  consequence,  it  causes  a  re- 
duction  of  the  driving  force  for  the  separation  of  CO 
2 .  Adsorp- 
tion,  absorption,  cryogenic  fractionation,  and  membrane  separa- 
tion are the most promising post-combustion approaches [54 , 58–
60 , 62] . Also, the ﬂow rate of ﬂue gas is usually 5–10 times larger 
than streams usually treated in natural gas and chemical industries 
[58] . In post-combustion CO 
2 capture, the exhaust gas with a par- 
tial pressure of 0.13–0.16 bar at 40–60 °C is fed to a MOF-based 
packed-bed reactor system. It sticks to MOFs surface either with 
the help of Van der Waals interactions or due to covalent bond 
formation. After saturation, the CO 
2  is regenerated through tem- 
perature swing or a pressure swing from the MOFs (further dis- 
cussed in Section 4 ). To achieve working capacities (deﬁned as the 
difference  between  CO 
2  uptake  capacity  of  MOFs  at  feed  condi- 
tion and desorption condition at the end of purge step) comparable 
to the amine process, the MOF must be heated to around 200 °C 
[64] .

The presence of competitive adsorption in binary mixtures such 
as  CO

ities.  Working  capacities  of  various  MOFs  vs  selectivity  for  CO 
2 
over  N 
2  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  3  [53] .  The  Mg-MOF-74  possesses 
2  sequestra- 
the highest working capacity for post-combustion CO 
tion at 5.87 mmol g −1 at ambient temperature while USTA-16 ex- 
hibits higher selectivity for CO 
2 [65] . The higher selectiv- 
ity of USTA-16 makes it more economical for large scale operation 
(further discussed in Section 8 ). Moreover, various strategies to en- 
2  uptake and selectivity such as increasing unsaturated

NO x and hydrochloric acid which create a very harsh and aggres- 
sive environment for various ﬁltration mediums. Exposure of MOFs 
to such a harsh environment and maintaining their stability is of 
great concern [50] . Speciﬁc MOFs can be selected for application 
based on the working environment; as they exhibit the varying ex- 
tent of chemical, mechanical and thermal, stabilities [31 , 32 , 66] .

For  instance,  Qiao  et  al.  [67]  synthesized  a  two-dimensional 
4 O]  cluster-based  MOF  with  a  chemical  formula 
(2D)  [Zn 
2 L)]} n ,  which  possesses  high  thermal  stabil- 
{Na[Zn 
ity  up  to  280  °C.  It  also  has  high  stability  towards  aqueous 
solutions  and  chemicals  with  pH  ranging  from  1  to  13.  The 
PXRD  and  gravimetric  analysis  (TGA)  analyses  of  the  synthe- 
sized  MOF  are  reported  based  on  12  h  exposure  of  the  MOF 
to  acidic  and  basic  solutions  with  pH  ranging  from  1  to  13 
resulting  in  no  changes  in  the  framework  while  disappears 
the  crystalline  structure  and  results  in  amorphous  shape  at 
pH  =  14.  Furthermore,  Hou  et  al.  [68]  synthesized  3D  anionic 
3 ·(In) 
MOF,  {(NH 
2 O}  showing  high 
stability towards acidic and basic conditions (pH = 2–12) and cor- 
rosive solvent trimethylamine up to one-month exposure. The MOF 
also exhibited high thermal stability up to 240 °C. It also possessed 
catalytic  properties  for  various  propargylic  alcohols  under  mild 
conditions. Sun et al. [69] constructed a mesoporous Zirconium- 
2 O]  (JLU- 
based  MOF,  [Zr 
MOF58)  which  exhibited  excellent  chemical  stability  towards 
acid  and  alkaline  aqueous  solution  of  pH  1–9.  JLU-MOF58  also

3. Stability of MOFs 

The stability of the MOFs is an important factor and plays a vi- 
tal role in their sustainable use in a harsh environment for CO 
2 
capturing. A typical composition of the ﬂue gases may consist 73–

various MOFs along with other important performance parameters 
are listed in Table 1 . 

3.1. Chemical stability 

The chemical stability is the extent to which MOFs resist main- 
taining their structure when employed in various harsh aqueous 
environments, i.e. acidic and basic solutions. The pH of the solu- 
tion  can  strongly  affect  the  adsorption  capabilities  of  the  MOFs. 
Therefore,  the  chemical  stability  of  the  employed  MOFs  is  mea- 
sured based on how they respond when exposed to varying val- 
ues of the pH [31 , 32] . As mentioned earlier, PXRD and TGA can 
be used to investigate and measure chemical stability as well as 
the  thermal  stability  of  the  MOFs  in  terms  of  structural  deteri- 
oration. These measurements indicate the changes in the surface 
area of speciﬁc MOFs when exposed to or soak in acidic or ba- 
sic medium. These acidic and basic conditions cause the surface 
of the MOFs to be collapsed or expanded upon their exposure to 
such conditions. The collapsed surface of such MOFs is an indica- 
tion of poor stability and as a result, the adsorption capacity re- 
duces and consequently makes MOFs less eﬃcient.  Fig. 4 (c) and 
(d) shows the XRD pattern of V-BDC and TGA curve of MIL-101 
(Cr), respectively [31 , 85 , 86] . Chemically stable MOF is the one that 
shows no or very low changes in its structure when exposed to dif- 
ferent pH solutions without signiﬁcantly compromising adsorption 
performance [31 , 86 , 87] . The stability of MOFs in different solutions 
is  assessed  by  comparing  the  Powder  X-Rays  Diffraction  (PXRD) 
of MOFs before and after soaking in a given solution [31 , 32 , 66] . 
It is greatly dependent on the inter-molecular or intra-molecular 
interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or π stacking [31 , 88 , 89] . 
For instance, Leus et al. [90] tested the chemical stability of MOFs 
2 -MIL-53, UiO- 
2 -MIL-101 (Al), MIL-53 (Al), NH 
like MIL-101 (Cr), NH 
2 -UiO-6 6, UiO-67 and ZIF-8 in air, water, acidic, basic and 
6 6, NH 
H 
2  solutions.  Table  2  shows  the  surface  area  of  the  MOFs  in 
2 O 
pH  conditions  of  0,  4  and  12  while  Table  3  shows  their  struc- 
tural stability in similar conditions both for 3 days and 2 months. 
2 O, HCl (pH = 1) and NaOH 
PXRD pattern of UiO-66 tested in H 
(pH  =  14)  is  shown  in  Fig.  4 (e).  MIL-101  (Cr)  shows  extremely 
high stability when exposing to acidic conditions of pH = 0 and 
4.  PXRD  pattern  shows  no  changes  even  after  exposure  to  the 
2 -MIL-101 (Al) shows 
MOF for 2 months. On the other hand, NH 
very  low  stability  on  its  exposure  to  such  acidic  conditions  and 
a  complete  dissolution  occurs  in  a  few  minutes  of  exposure  to 
high acidic conditions of pH = 0. Even for 3 days of exposure of 
2 -MIL-101 (Al) to pH = 4 causes its conversion to a more ther- 
NH 
2 -MIL-53  [90 , 91] .  Furthermore, 
modynamically  stable  form  of  NH 
{(NH 
2 O} MOF also shows high 
stability towards acidic and basic conditions (pH = 2–12) and cor- 
rosive solvent trimethylamine up to one-month exposure. The MOF 
also exhibits high thermal stability up to 240 °C and catalytic prop- 
erties for various propargylic alcohol under mild conditions [68] .

Similarly, ZIF-8 and Cu-BTC also dissolve directly when exposed 
to  pH  =  0  acidic  solution.  Besides  these,  UiO-66  and  NH 
2 -UiO- 
66 show high stability and no loss in their crystallinity when ex- 
posed to acidic conditions of pH = 0 and 4 even for two months 
[70 , 90 , 92] . MIL-101 (Cr) shows high stability on its exposure to the 
basic conditions of pH = 12 and shows no changes in crystallinity 
even after 2 months of exposure while NH 
2 -MIL-101 (Al) and Cu- 
BTC show low chemical stability towards basic solution and con- 
vert to other crystalline forms even when exposing for only 3 days 
2 -MIL-53 (Al) shows high stability and no 
[90] . MIL-53 (Al) and NH 
changes in their crystalline structure on their exposure to the ba- 
sic medium. Similarly, ZIF-8, UiO-67, UiO-6 6, and NH 
2 -UiO-6 6 also 
exhibit  high  resistance  towards  basic  conditions  and  no  changes 
were observed in their PXRD pattern [92] . Moreover, highly sta- 
ble MOF in acidic and basic environments, MIL-101 (Cr), also ex- 

2 O 

hibits exceptional stability towards H 
2  and converts to a crys- 
talline structure of MIL-53 after prolonged exposure of 2 months. 
2 -MIL-101 (Al) and UiO-67 shows low stability and 
In contrast, NH 
degrade  completely  after  3  days  of  exposure  to  H 
2 .  However, 
UiO-66 and NH 
2 -UiO-66 show high stability towards the oxidative 
environment as no changes were observed in their PXRD pattern 
and Langmuir surface area after exposure [70 , 90] . 

2 O 

The chemical stability of isotypic MOFs relies on the nature of 
central metal ion. More speciﬁcally, the central metal ion causes 
a  chemical  reaction  with  environmental  species  to  which  MOFs 
are  exposed  and  as  a  result,  the  whole  structure  may  degrade 
[90 , 91] . Hence, the chemical stability of a MOF will be high if a 
more inert central metal ion is incorporated in the MOF structure. 
Kang et al. [91] investigated the chemical stability of isotypic MOFs 
(Me-BDCs), MIL-53(Al), MIL-53(Cr) and MIL-47(V). Fig. 4 (b) and (c) 
shows the XRD pattern of Cr-BDC (MIL-53-Cr: Chromium benzene- 
dicarboxylate as more inert) in comparison to V-BDC (MIL-47-V: 
Vanadium benzene-dicarboxylate as less inert) both in 0.07 M HCl 
solution, respectively. V-BDC dissolved after 6 h of exposure to the 
acid while Cr-BDC retains its structure [91] . It was found that the 
chemical  stability  decreased  in  the  order  of  MIL-53(Cr)  >  MIL- 
53(Al)  >  MIL-47(V).  Fig.  2 (a)  illustrates  the  dominant  effect  of 
metal ions on the chemical stability of MOFs [93] . Therefore, MOFs 
containing Cr (III) or Rh (III) as a central metal ion will be more 
stable. Similarly, Leus et al. [94] investigated the thermal stability 
of MIL-101 (Cr) in acidic conditions of 1 M HCl for 3 days. Fig. 4 (d) 
depicts TGA curves for MIL-101 (Cr) before and after treating with 
1 M HCl at the heating rate of 2 °C/min. One can conclude from the 
ﬁgure that the ﬁrst weight loss of pristine MIL-101 (Cr) appears at 
250–260 °C but after acid exposure, the ﬁrst weight loss at 250 °C 
is absent indicating that the exposure to acid removes free organic 
linker from the pores [94] . 

3.2. Thermal stability 

Thermal degradation refers to the breakdown of the node-linker 
bond followed by the combustion of the linker as a consequence of 
exposure of MOFs to high temperatures. Generally, the thermal sta- 
bility of MOF is related to the strength of the bond between node 
and linker and the number of linkers bonded to each node. Hence, 
the higher the node-linker bond strength and the greater the num- 
ber  of  linkers  connected  to  each  node  results  in  higher  thermal 
stability of the MOF [31] . The majority of MOFs use carboxylate 
groups and divalent cations like Zn(II), Cu(II), Co(II), etc. These link- 
ers are comparatively weak as compared to trivalent cations having 
low metal-ligand bond strength and hence resulting in degradation 
of the MOFs quickly as compared to trivalent metal centers. By the 
insertion  of  equivalent  oxyanion-terminated  linkers  like  trivalent 
Al(III), Zr(III) and Ti(III) metal centers or changing the composition 
of linkers can increase the thermal stability because of increased 
metal-ligand bond strength [86 , 95 , 96] . 

The  most  thermally  stable  MOFs  like  Zirconium  based  MOFs 
(UiF-6 6(Zr)-(COOH) 
2 , UiO-6 6(Zr)-(COOLi), etc.), retain their poros- 
ity and crystallinity at a temperature > 500 °C. So far, with the 
use of MOFs, thermal stability is considered to be a big challenge 
and  is  more  important  as  compared  to  other  stabilities  [31 , 97] . 
TGA  is  used  to  measure  the  thermal  stability  of  different  MOFs. 
The thermal stability of MOF-5 is illustrated in Fig. 5 (b) by a typi- 
cal TGA curve. It demonstrated the removal of DMF molecule and 
the  collapse  of  frameworks  by  initial  weight  loss  (22.0%)  from 
100 to 250 °C followed by another weight loss (44.0%) at 480 °C, 
respectively  [98] .  For  some  well-known  Zirconium  based  MOFs, 
the residual weight compositions after thermal testing are given 
as  UiO-66(Zr)-(COOH) 
2  (35.7),  UiO- 
2  (42.5%).  It  employs 
66(Zr)-(COONa) 
that Zirconium based MOFs are thermally more stable. The trend of

molecular weight increase is because of the inserted alkaline met- 
als [99] . Hester et al. [100] investigated the effect of Pt (0.5 wt%) 
catalyst encapsulation on Zr-based UiO-67 MOF. The thermal be- 
havior of the resultant Pt-UiO-67 and UiO-67 was compared using 
TGA and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The results revealed 
that the incorporation of Pt nanoparticles reduces the critical tem- 
perature of thermal degradation by 14%. The incorporation of Pt 
2  making the PtNP@UiO-67 
NPs enhances the chemisorption of H 
suitable for hydrogenation reactions and H 
2 storage. However, the 
Pt  encapsulated  UiO-67  was  found  to  be  stable  up  to  600  K  as 
shown in Fig. 5 (a). 

Moreover,  thermal  dehydration  occurs  at  a  temperature  well 
below the temperature for MOFs framework disintegration and has 
a  prominent  effect  on  the  catalytic  properties  of  MOF  structure 
and resulting changes in the node-structure of MOF. Dehydration 
causes the removal of aqua ligands at the node or condensing of 
hydroxo-ligands and molecular water. More speciﬁcally, framework 

catenation or interweaving of MOFs network is useful in enhancing 
the stability of MOFs towards framework-framework interactions. 
These catenations and other densiﬁcation processes are useful for 
the improvement of some properties of MOFs like larger pore vol- 
umes [87 , 101 , 102] . 

3.3. Stability in humid air 

For the industrial application of gas separation and storage, the 
structural stability of MOFs is an important criterion. However, one 
of the major issues that limit their applications is relatively low 
stability in moisture conditions. The limited stability is due to the 
strong interactions of metal nodes with water molecules resulting 
in the cleavage of coordination bonds and causes framework de- 
struction. Most of the hydrothermally synthesized MIL series MOFs 
have been reported to be stable in moisture conditions constructed 
by  aluminum  (or  chromium)  metal  clusters  and  organic  ligands

pors  in  the  absence of  other  gases  [31] .  Based  on  these  proper- 
ties of MOFs, they have been considered as storage materials for 
heat or thermal energy as well. For this purpose, more hydrother- 
mally stable materials are required. Hydrothermal stability is mea- 
sured by exposing MOFs to vapors at various conditions of tem- 
peratures and pressures and then followed by standard PXRD and 
measurements of surface area or porosity. The hydrothermal sta- 
bility  is  critically  evaluated  for  MOFs  by  atomic-layer  deposition 
in the MOFs (AIM) method, which includes the exposure of MOFs 
to steam at higher temperatures [96] . For example, the Zirconium- 
based MOFs were exposed to diethylzinc and trimethylaluminum 
at temperatures 140 and 110 °C, respectively and then followed by 
the reaction with steam to form Zn(2) and Al(3) oxides or hydrated 
nodes of MOF. For this modiﬁcation, the MOF should have ther- 
mal  stability  as  well  as  large  aperture  sizes  or  channels  [31 , 96] . 
But MOFs, which are specially synthesized for gas adsorption ap- 
plications like CO 
2 capture from ﬂue gases, cannot withstand high 
temperatures  when  moisture  is  present.  Before  reaching  the  de- 
sired temperature, the MOF may be degraded due to lower chemi- 
cal or mechanical stability, which is a potential limitation of MOFs 
[107–109] . 

Some MOFs have shown high stability when exposed to steam 
or  boiling  water  such  as  Al-based  MOFs  including  BIT-72  (Al- 
OH-BDC),  BIT-73  (Al-CH3-BDC)  and  BIT-74  (Al-(CH3)2-BDC).  The 
high  adsorption  performance  in  hot  water  and  acidic  environ- 
ment  of  these  Al-MOFs  is  due  to  the  incorporation  of  a  mono- 
hydroxyl group, mono-methyl group or dimethyl group decorated 
with terephthalic acid. Due to the incorporation of these functional 
groups, the ability of adsorption of the MOFs towards CO 
2 is en- 
hanced  while  adapting  the  same  microporous  structure.  Among 
all  these  three  MOFs,  BIT-72  (Al-OH-BDC)  with  the  incorporated 
hydroxyl-OH group has the highest surface area of 1618 m 2 /g and 
the  highest  selectivity  CO 
2  [110] .  Moreover, 
another MOF 2,5-dihydroxybenzenedicarboxylic acid (DOBDC) se- 
ries also performs well in high temperatures and humid environ- 
ments.  Interestingly,  nickel-based  DOBDC  MOF  was  observed  to 
be  more  stable  than  Magnesium  based  DOBDC  MOF.  At  38  °C, 
for steamed Ni-DOBDC, the CO 
2  capture capacity is 2.73 mol/kg, 
which is comparable to that of un-steamed one (2.98 mol/kg), and 
shows  that  it  is  more  hydrothermally  stable,  while  for  steamed 
2  capture capacity is 2.41 mol/kg, and for un- 
Mg-DOBDC the CO 
steamed the CO 
2  capture capacity is 4.93 mol/kg, indicating Mg- 
DOBDC is hydrothermally unstable than Ni-DOBDC. Fig. 7 shows 
the CO 
2  adsorption isotherms for Ni-DOBDC and Mg-DOBDC, re- 
spectively both at 38 °C before and after steaming for 2 h [111] .

Moreover,  porous  MOFs  based  on  carboxylate  having  node 
based  on  multiple  Cr(III),  V(IV),  Al(III),  Fe(III)  and  Zr(IV)  have 
the  abilities  of  showing  high  thermal  stabilities  to  water  va- 
pors as compared to multiple zinc-based node like MOF-5, MOF- 
177,  DUT-30,  UMCM-1,  and  DMOF-1,  which  are  unstable  when 
expose  to  higher  moisture  [112–115] .  The  hydrothermal  stabili- 
ties of MOFs are strongly dependent upon the node-linker bond 
strength  of  MOF.  Those  having  a  high  heat  of  formation  of  the 
node-linker  bond  are  more  hydrothermally  stable  as  compared 
to  low  heat  of  formation  of  the  node-linker  bond.  For  exam- 
ple,  the  strength  of  the  bond  between  Al–O  in  MIL-53  MOF  re- 
quires  heat  energy  of  520  kJ/mol,  whereas  the  bond  between 
Zn–O  in  MOF-5  requires  heat  energy  of  365  kJ/mol,  indicating 
MIL-53  MOF  is  hydrothermally  more  stable  than  MOF-5  [112–
115] .  Furthermore,  a  class  of  amine-functionalized  MOF  contain- 
ing 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-diamineopropane (dmpn) attached to magne- 
sium  (Mg + 2 )  sites  lining  the  channels  of  Mg

from ﬂue gases released by the combustion of coal at a temper- 
ature of 40 °C and shows complete desorption at 100 °C and en-

[103] . MIL-101 (Cr) showed high stability towards water and air. 
The structure was preserved even for 2 months of its exposure to 
water and air, and there is no change in the Langmuir surface area 
and PXRD pattern [90 , 104] . The stability of MIL-101 (Cr) towards 
water  and  air  may  be  attributed  to  the  inertness  of  Cr  [91] .  In 
contrast NH 
2 -MIL-101 (Al) indicates a decrease in Langmuir sur- 
face area after 3 days of exposure to air and water from 2026 to 
1060 m 2 /g. It undergoes a partial transformation to another form, 
2 -MIL-53, and as a result, PXRD pattern also changes. Also, MIL- 
NH 
53 (Al) and NH 
2 -MIL-53 MOFs also possess good stability towards 
water and air and no signiﬁcant changes can be observed in the 
Langmuir surface area and PXRD pattern even after 2 months of 
exposure.  The  high  stability  of  MIL-53  (Al)  could  be  due  to  the 
presence of a strong bond of aluminum (Al) sites on the secondary 
building units (SBUs) and oxygen [70] . On the other hand, Cu-BTC 
has been reported as unstable material towards the water. After 
3 days of exposure to water, moderate changes in the PXRD pat- 
tern  can  be  observed  showing  degradation  of  the  MOF.  The  in- 
stability  of  Cu-BTC  towards  water  may  be  due  to  the  coordina- 
tion  of  water  molecules  along  the  Cu–Cu  axis,  indicating  distor- 
tion of SBUs along the axis. In contrast to Cu-BTC, Zirconium based 
MOF, UiO-66, shows high stability towards the water because of 
fully saturated sites. The saturated sites help to avoid the coordi- 
nation of water molecules with the framework. The PXRD pattern 
of the UiO-66 for exposure to 80% relative humidity for 7 and 20 
days explored by Chen and co-workers [105] as shown in Fig. 6 . 
No changes in PXRD pattern and Langmuir surface area were ob- 
served even after 2 months of exposure to water. Additionally, the 
incorporation of functional groups to the parent MOF, UiO-66, can 
increase the stability of the air. UiO-66 shows degradation after 3 
days of exposure to air while NH 
2 -UiO-66 shows no changes in the 
PXRD pattern and structure of the MOF [92] . Similarly, an extended 
form of UiO-66, UiO-67, have also good stability in the water envi- 
ronment [106] . It showed no changes in the PXRD pattern after 2 
months of exposure to water but shows a signiﬁcant change in the 
Langmuir surface area, which is reduced from 2395 to 523 m 2 /g 
after 2 months of exposure to air. Table 3 shows the PXRD report 
for the MOFs for 3 days and 2 months in different conditions [90] . 

3.4. Hydrothermal stability 

MOFs have the adsorbing and desorbing function of water va- 
pors, and they can also withstand high temperatures for water va-

pletely disintegrates after exposure to hydrothermal testing. On the 
other hand, ZIF-8 shows high stability towards hydrothermal treat- 
ments and shows a very small decrease in the Langmuir surface 
area from 772 to 660 m 2 /g. It was also observed that ZIF-8 can 
withstand steam for several hours while boiling water for at least 
a week [114] . Additionally, UiO-66 and NH2-UiO-66 showed high 
stability towards steam at 200 °C for 5 h while UiO-67 shows com- 
plete destruction in the hydrothermal environment because of the 
linker hydrolysis in the MOF structure [90 , 120] . Table 4 summa- 
rizes the hydrothermal stability of different MOFs. 

The  hydrothermal  stability  can  be  increased  by  creating  hy- 
drophobic  surfaces  on  the  surface  of  MOF.  Hydrophobicity  is 
mostly increased by introducing synthetic ﬂuorous MOFs (FMOFs), 
where hydrogen is replaced by ﬂuorine atom in all ligands. FMOFs 
exhibited high thermal stability and hydrothermal stability (or hy- 
drophobicity) [102 , 121] . Chen et al. [122] synthesized Cobalt-based 
MOF Co-PL-1, with the help of microwave irradiation instead of us- 
ing the hydrothermal process of preparation. The microwave irra- 
diation prepared MOF greatly reduces synthesis time to 30 min as 
compared to hydrothermal synthesis in 3 days. The resultant MOF 
2 uptake and good structural stability in moisture con- 
has high CO 
2 selectivity of 19.8 at 1 bar while 44 at 0.15 bar.

3.5. Mechanical stability 

Mechanical properties of MOFs are very important when under- 
going chemical sensing and ﬁltering. The basic structure of MOFs 
plays  an  important  role  than  chemical  functionality,  in  ﬁnding 
physical properties like elastic moduli, compressibility, and rigid- 
ity. Although MOFs are known for their porous nature and it also 
counts for adsorption abilities, their mechanical stability decreases 
with an increase in the porous nature (porosity) of MOFs [31] . Gen- 
erally, highly porous MOFs are mechanically unstable. This instabil- 
ity of MOFs upon mechanical loading causes the partial collapse of 
pores or even phase change of the MOFs. For example, MOF UiO- 
66 is more mechanically stable than other MOFs and ZIFs because 
of its less porosity [102 , 123–125 ]. During ball milling of MOFs, the 
survival time of the crystallinity of MOFs is considered as an in- 
dicator  for  mechanical  stability.  Such  an  assessment  shows  how 
the presence of defects (linker missing) in MOFs crystal is detri- 
mental  for  MOFs  mechanical  stability  [31] .  Various  studies  have 
shown that MOFs ﬁlled with solvent have more mechanical sta- 
bilities  than  empty  pores  of  MOFs  [126 , 127] .  Generally,  multiva- 
lent (trivalent or tetravalent) zirconium-based MOFs have high me- 
chanical stabilities relative to divalent metals, because tetravalent 
and trivalent have higher coordination number than those of diva- 
lent metals. The coordination number of nodes of MOFs is directly 
related to the node-linker bond strength. Other studies also have 
shown that the mechanical stability of the MOFs can be enhanced 
by increasing the coordination number of metal or shortening the 
linker. Also, the geometry of MOFs affects mechanical stability or 
also known as shear-stress stability [31 , 125 , 128–131 ]. 

Mechanical degradation of MOFs also occurs during the removal 
of the associated pore-ﬁlling solvent, generally water, by the ex- 
ertion of capillary forces. Various zirconium-based MOFs are very 
sensitive to such capillary forces and cause degradation. A way to 
overcome this type of degradation is by exchanging the water sol- 
vent with liquid CO 
2 and then removing it at the suitable super- 
critical condition. At supercritical state, capillary forces are negli- 
gible and surface tension of CO 
2  is zero. Another way of reduc- 
ing the size of the water cluster in zirconium-based MOFs is the 
attachment of hydrocarbons and ﬂuorocarbons chain to nodes of 
MOFs such that to eliminate hydrogen-bonding between the sol- 
vent (water) molecule and node [31 , 125 , 132] . 

So far, CO 

2 capturing is the most challenging step with minimal 
energy usage and improved stability and selectivity [133] . Zornoza

2 [116] . Furthermore, TGA 
ables high working capacity swing for CO 
and  breakthrough  experiments  showed  that  dmpn-Mg 
2 (dobpdc), 
as compared to many other adsorbents, has high potential for ef- 
fective CO 
2 capture and it can also be subjected to 10 0 0 cycles of 
humid adsorption/desorption with no moderate degradation in the 
structure of the MOF, conﬁrming the high stability of the MOF in 
water [116] . 

A highly stable chromium-based MOF in an acidic and basic en- 
vironment, MIL-101 (Cr), also shows high stability towards steam 
and preserves its crystalline structure after exposure of 5–7 days 
to hot water at 80 °C. No changes in the structure and PXRD pat- 
tern was observed [104] . In contrast to MIL-101 (Cr), Fe (3) and Al 
(3) analogs of MIL-101 show a much lower hydrothermal stabilities

and converts to a highly stable NH 
sure to water [118] . The resulted structure, NH 
2 -MIL-53, on expo- 
sure to water shows high stability towards steaming and shows no 
changes in its PXRD pattern after the test. In contrast to NH 
2 -MIL- 
53, MIL-53 (Al) is less stable towards the steam test and shows the 
partial  transformation  of  its  structure.  After  steaming,  the  Lang- 
muir surface area for MIL-53 (Al) shows a reduction from 1531 to 
792 m 2 /g. This reduction in the Langmuir surface area shows par- 
tial hydrolysis of the MOF [90 , 119] . Likewise, CuBTC shows no tol- 
erance towards hydrothermal treatments and changes in its struc- 
ture  were  observed.  Besides,  it  also  loses  its  porosity  and  com-

et al. [134] suggested different ﬁller combinations like MOF–MOF, 
MOF–zeolite, and zeolite–zeolite which may lead to the best per- 
forming MMMs for CO 
2 separation. These possible results of these 
combinations would be to achieve the best permeability and selec- 
tivity and possibly to keep the mechanical properties constant. Wu 
et  al.  [125]  reported  mechanical stability  in terms  of  bulk  mod- 
ulus  and  shear  modulus  against  the  porosity  and  metal-center- 
linker coordination number for some MOFs. Table 5 summarizes 
the structural stability of different MOFs in terms of their elastic 
moduli and coordination number of metal-center-linker [125 , 130] . 
Moreover,  it  was  observed  that  MOFs  with  a  high  coordination 
number of metal-center-linker and lower porosity have higher me- 
chanical stabilities showing higher values of bulk and shear moduli 
as compared to MOFs with lower values of metal-center-linker co- 
ordination number and high porosity [125 , 128–130 ]. Furthermore, 
Santos et al. [131] studied the stability of MOF-177 for CO 
2 sepa- 
ration under high pressure of 200 bar and different temperatures 
of 20, 40 and 60 °C for 12 h. No signiﬁcant changes in its area and 
2 adsorption were observed at 20 and 40 °C however, the note- 
CO 
worthy reduction was observed at 60 °C. 

4. CO 2 adsorption mechanism in MOFs 

Various physical adsorbent including MOFs and Zeolitic imida- 
zolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been used to adsorb gases from var- 
ious sources at different concentrations. Mostly, these physical ad- 
2 from ﬂue gases 
sorbents, speciﬁcally MOFs are used to adsorb CO 
2  and  regenerate 
2  sources.  To  desorb  captured  CO 
and  other  CO 
the adsorbent MOFs for further use, temperature swing adsorption

2 is introduced to rinse the N 

(TSA) and pressure (PSA) or vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) meth- 
ods are used ( Fig. 6 (a)) [5] . Ben-Mansour and Qasem [135] stud- 
ied a numerically modeled TSA process for CO 
2 separation run in 
four-step cycles, i.e. feeding, rinsing, heating and cooling, for inves- 
tigating the optimal conﬁguration of Mg-MOF-74 as an adsorbent 
bed for separating CO 
2  mixture. The gas mixture is 
2 /N 
fed to pass through the Mg-MOF-74 bed for a certain time limit 
at speciﬁc conditions of temperature and pressure. In the case of 
2 from the 
CO 
adsorbent bed. For the desorption of CO 
2 and regeneration of the 
MOF’s bed, heat is needed to increase the bed temperature. Be- 
fore feeding for the next adsorption cycle, the bed must be cooled 
down by using certain cooling processes like natural or forced con- 
vection, radiation and any other cooling process [135] . PSA is also 
run in a four-steps cycle, i.e. adsorption of a target gas from gas 
mixture stream, co-current blow-down of gas using vacuum pump, 
counter-current evacuation of the column from the free-end, and 
light product pressurization with the help of outlet stream from 
the adsorption step. In the adsorption step, the column is operated

Finally,  the  stream  resulted  from  the  adsorption  step  is  used  to

of  Pd-loaded  activated  carbon  (AC)  on  CO 
2  adsorption  for  MOF- 
74-Ni,  MOF-74-Co.  The  results  revealed  that  the  modiﬁed  struc- 
tures, MOF-74(Ni)-Pd and MOF-74(Co)-Pd, showed high CO 
2 uptake 
than their pristine structures. MOF-74(Ni)-Pd and MOF-74(Co)-Pd 
2 adsorption capacity of 4.38 and 3.96 mmol/g, respec- 
showed CO 
tively, as compared to 4.06 and 3.67 mmol/g respectively for MOF- 
74-Ni and MOF-74-Co both at 298 K and 1.1 bar. Similarly, for high- 
pressure CO 
2 adsorption, MOF-74(Ni)-Pd and MOF-74(Co)-Pd show 
12.24 and 11.42 mmol/g as compared to 11.06 and 10.28 mmol/g 
for MOF-74-Ni and MOF-74-Co both at 298 K and 32 bar. The en- 
hancement in CO 
2  separation is a conse- 
quence  of  the  interaction  between  the  partially  negative  charge 
2  and partially positive change Pd atom 
oxygen atom of polar CO 
due  to  its  low  electronegativity.  Fig.  8 (c)  shows  the  CO

To design adsorbent, some parameters like CO 

2  aﬃnity, kinet- 
ics, stability and capturing mechanism are important to check. CO 
2 
adsorption depends on the CO 
2  selectivity relative to other gases 
present in the mixture of feed streams [5 , 49] . Here we mainly fo- 
cused  on  CO 
2  capturing  performance  and  selectivity  of  different 
MOFs. Milner et al. [116] reported the gas adsorption measurement 
of dmpn–Mg 
2 O by using the 
volumetric method with the help of gas adsorption analyzer. The 
purity of the adsorbed gases was equal to or greater than 99.998%. 
The water in deionized form then subjected to three freeze-pump- 
thaw  cycles  before  adsorption  isotherm  measurement.  Isotherms 
were generated for different temperatures using a water bath (for 
up to 75 °C) and sand bath (for 100 °C) under controlled temper- 
2 ad- 
ature with a programmable controller. Fig. 8 (b) shows the CO

tures [116] .

MOF-Co,  MOF-Mn,  MOF-Mg,  MOF-Zn,  and  MOF-Fe,  from  dry 
ﬂue  gas  (15%  CO 
2 ).  The  cycle  conﬁguration 
consists of steps namely, feed/adsorption, co-current blow-down, 
evacuation,  light  product  pressurization  and  feed  pressurization. 
In the feed/adsorption step, the dry ﬂue gas is introduced at the 
bottom of the column at high pressure and the N 
2 rich product is 
obtained from the top of the column. In the co-current blowdown 
step, the feed end of the column is closed and the depressurized 
2  and 
the column from top to intermediate pressure to remove N 
increase the purity of CO 
2 . In the evacuation step, the concentrated 
CO 
2 is removed from the bottom end while reducing the column 
pressure from intermediate to low pressure. In the light product 
pressurization step, the bottom end of the column is closed and 
the light product from the adsorption step is re-pressurized from 
top  of  the  column  to  high  pressure  resulting  in  compression  of 
the  CO 
2  recovery 
enhances. In the feed pressurization step, additional pressurization 
using  feed takes  place from  the  bottom  when  the  product  from 
the adsorption step is not enough to pressurize the column to high

The mechanism for the selective CO 

2 capture from other probe 
2  inter- 
molecules  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  strength  of  CO 
actions  with  the  adsorbent  as  compared  to  the  other  probe 
2  molecules  with  ad- 
molecules.  Stronger  the  interactions  of  CO 
sorbent  as  compared  to  other  molecules  like  CH 
2,  etc., 
2  will  be  adsorbed.  Equilibrium  based  mechanism  is 
more  CO 
mainly based on the strength regardless of the uniformity of these

2 uptake of 0.08, 0.13 and 1.24 mmol/g with CO 

molecules [49 , 141] . In this mechanism, the potential of the phys- 
ical adsorbent towards CO 
2  capturing capacity is the main factor 
2  separation  from  other  gases.  Examples 
driving  the  selective  CO 
of  adsorbents  using  an  equilibrium-based  adsorption  mechanism 
are Mg-MOF-74, rht-MOF-7, fcu-MOFs, and also some other MOFs 
which are selectively used for CO 
2  capture [49 , 54] . On the other 
hand, kinetic sieving is used when the molecular size of the gases 
2 . Ki- 
is very narrow enough or having the same size that of CO 
2  separating 
netics driven sieving is a well-known method for CO 
from a stream of nearly similar-sized molecules like N 
4 and 
2 [49 , 54 , 88] . However, it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd such MOF which 
O 
will  selectively  adsorb  only  CO 
2  from  ﬂue  gases’  stream.  There- 
fore, proper selection of the MOF should be made which can cap- 
2 and capable of separating it. For enhancing the selectivity 
ture CO 
2 , Section 5 provides some strategies. In the 
of a MOF towards CO 
case of MOFs, some other, gases are also captured along with CO 
2 
which can be separated at the end. However, to get a high aﬃnity 
2 , a combination of two adsorptions the sites 
of MOFs toward CO 
have been proved very effective. Belmabkhout et al. [49] investi- 
gated MOFs like Mg-MOF-74, SIFSIX-3-Zn and SIFSIX-3-Cu which 
were  recognized  to  manifest  very  fast  adsorption  kinetics  with 
2 /N 
gravimetric CO 
2 
selectivity of 182, 1700 and < 2000, respectively. It was observed 
that  the  synergistic  effect  of  combining  Mg  sites  and  hydroxyl 
groups in Mg-MOF-74 ( Fig. 8 (f)) signiﬁcantly enhances the CO 
2 up- 
take in channels. The combination of two adsorption sites in some 
MOFs  adsorbent  like  Mg-MOF-74  with  open-metal  sites  and  hy- 
droxyl groups at low pressure, 0.1 bar, showed BET surface area of 
1640 m 2 /g with gravimetric CO 
2 /N 
2 
selectivity of 182 (in a mixture of 15/85 = CO 
2 at 1 bar) while 
rht-MOF-7 (1900 m 2 /g, 0.3 mmol/g and CO 
2 :10/90 = 25) and 
2 /N 
Tb-fcu-MOF-1  (1220  m 2 /g,  0.4  mmol/g  and  CO 
2 :10/90  =  15) 
2 /N 
give promising results for CO 
2 separation at very low pressure [49] . 
The fast adsorption kinetics mostly occur in the MOFs with narrow 
size pores while using these narrow pore sizes as kinetic-selective 
separation of the gases. Generally, the pore size less than 40 nm 
2 as a fast diffusing molecules 
have more potential to separate CO 
quickly as compared to other gases like CH 
2 as slowly 
2 , and N 
diffusing gases based on the kinetics of gases as a main driving 
force for separation [49] . Moreover, Devic and Serre [95] explored 
the structures of different MOFs (MIL-53 and its polymorph MIL- 
68, MIL-88 and MIL-100) based on M +3 cations (Al, Cr, Fe, Ga, In 
etc.)  deﬁning  the  1D  pores  resulting  in  diamond-shaped  in  case 
of  MIL-53  while  triangular  and  hexagonal-shaped  for  MIL-68  as 
shown in Fig. 8 (g).

5. Strategies for enhancing CO 2 adsorption in MOFs 

The enhancement in the ability of MOFs to capture CO 

2  from 
the mixture of different gases is dependent on intrinsic properties 
of the MOFs and also on the properties of the mixed gases or mix- 
ture from which CO 
2 is to be adsorbed in the MOFs. These prop- 
erties include the structure and design of the MOF, synthesis, and 
porosity of MOFs [4] . The main objectives are to promote the CO 
2 
adsorption, selectivity, and stability of MOFs, i.e. to separate CO 
2 
eﬃciently  at  ambient  or  higher  temperatures  and  low  pressures 
for long service life [4] . For instance, Wang et al. [74] synthesized a 
Ni-based MOF with trinuclear nickel cluster which possesses high 
2 uptake of about 37.57 cm 3 /g and high selectivity toward CO 
CO 
2 
over N 
2 of about 42.89 at 273 K. Lanthanide-based MOFs showed 
2 . Liao et al. [76] synthe- 
2 from N 
high adsorption selectivity for CO 
sized an EU-MOF which was used for selective adsorption of CO 
2 
from N 
2 selectivity of up to 109.4 at 273 K and 1 atm. 
Chen et al. [142] investigated a Ni-based MOF-74 prepared by hy- 
drothermal, condensation reﬂux and microwave-assisted methods. 
The  adsorption  capacity  of  5.22  mmol/g  at  25  °C  was  obtained

show 
interpenetration in their frameworks. The MOF, Cu(fma)(bpee)0.5, 
is  designed  from  a  primitive  cubic  net  and  the  size  of  its  pore 
cavity  is  3.6  A °.  These  MOFs  are  used  for  the  high  adsorption 
capacity of CO 
2  [144–146] . The pore size of various MOFs along 
with other important performance parameters is listed in Table 1 . 

5.2. Functionalizing pore surface of MOFs 

2 (COO) 

The  modiﬁcation  in  surface  properties  of  MOFs  increases  the 
CO 
2  adsorption capacity. The modiﬁcation in the surface proper- 
ties of MOFs can be carried out before the design of ligands but 
it can also be carried out  after synthesis of the MOFs.  It would 
be better to tune the surface properties before the design of lig- 
and,  nodes  (containing  metal),  and  construction  of  MOF  as  tun- 
ing surface properties after these steps do not signiﬁcantly affect 
the performance of the MOF [4] . At the porous wall of the MOFs, 
there are open active metal sites that increase the CO 
2 capturing. 
These open active metals in MOFs are usually created after syn- 
thesizing the MOF. The most common example of an open metal 
4 . Some MOFs like MIL-100 and MIL-101 also con- 
site is Cu 
2 adsorp- 
tain open metal sites which are also used for eﬃcient CO 
tion [4 , 147 , 148] . It is important to make the MOF basic in nature 
for capturing the acidic CO 
2 . The acidic nature of the MOF can be 
obtained by surface modiﬁcations of the MOF with amines using 
two approaches. One method is utilizing amine-functionalized lig- 
ands in the synthesis of the MOF. For example, the synthesis of 
amine-functionalized MIL-53 (Al) using 2-amino terephthalic acid 
as a ligand showed high CO 
2 adsorption. Another useful method is 
related to the post-synthetic modiﬁcation of the MOF by the im- 
pregnation  method.  In  this  approach,  the  pores  of  the  MOF  are 
2  adsorption as a consequence 
rich in amine and shows high CO 
of free amine groups in the pores [149 , 150] . Furthermore, Wang 
et al. [151] investigated an NP-MOF, NPPCF-700, containing N and 
P heteroatoms creating polar surfaces to enhance CO 
2  adsorption 
in the MOF. The incorporated N and P heteroatoms in the surface 
of the framework help to provide a large number of polar groups 
which in turn increases the aﬃnity of polar CO 
2 to be captured ef- 
ﬁciently. This strategy also provides ultra-high surface area by one 
step carbonization. The results showed an optimum CO 
2 uptake of 
99.4 ml/g at 273 K and 1 atm. The synthesized MOF showed out- 
standing recycling stability for 11 cycles with 0.2% drop in CO 
2 ad- 
sorption capacity showing that the MOF could be completely re- 
generated.  Fig.  10 (c)  shows  recyclability  of  the  MOF  for  ﬁve  cy- 
cles versus CO 
2 uptake [151] . Mutyala et al. [150] incorporated PEI 
by using a wet impregnation method to prepare MIL-101 (Cr). The 
results revealed that the PEI incorporated MIL-101 (Cr) showed a 
high CO 
2  adsorption capacity of 3.81 mmol/g upon 70 wt% load- 
ing of PEI which is 4.7 times more than the parent MIL-101 (Cr). 
Also, the –NH 
2 combination resulted in the formation of 
Carbamate [150] .

3 (BTTri) 

The amine functionalization is used for enhancing CO 

2 capture 
in MOFs. By adding the amine-functionalized ligand to MOFs it will 
form  amino-MIL-53(Al)  [153] .  Furthermore,  by  post-synthetically 
treatment  of  exposed  metal  site  of  HCu[(Cu 
8 ]  (Cu- 
BTTri) is coordinated by ethylenediamine to get en-functionalized 
MOF as shown in Fig. 10 (a) [152] . These en-functionalized MOFs 
can capture CO 
2 at low pressure and also have high initial heat of 
adsorption (90 kJ/mol) as compared to their parent framework. In 
the same way, acylamide is also used to enhance the CO 
2 capturing 
2 into Al(OH)(bpydc) 
in MOFs [154] . By inserting metal salt Cu(BF 
is also used to enhance CO 
2 capturing because the metal salt cre- 
ates electric dipole on the surface of MOFs. It also increases the 
heat  of  adsorption  from  23  to  30  kJ/mol  [155] .  Besides,  Forgan 
2 by direct poly- 
[156] altered the surface chemistry of UiO-66-NH

within 60 min via microwave process which is six times greater 
than that of commercial activated carbon and 3.37 mmol/g capac- 
ity under humid condition (RH = 90%). The CO 
2 selectivity of 
the microwave-assisted MOF was shown to be 31 with excellent 
recyclability  of  the  MOF.  The  adsorption  performance  of  various 
MOFs  is  summarized  in  Table  1 .  The  following  sections  present 
some strategies by which the CO 
2 separation ability of MOFs can 
be enhanced to a high level.

5.1. Fixing pore shape and size in MOFs 

For selective separation, the shape and size are the ﬁrst steps 
for selecting the porous materials. The big advantage of the MOFs 
is that they have controllable synthesis and modiﬁed for speciﬁc 
separation as compared to other materials [4] . An example of con- 
trol of pore size is ZIFs, in which the selectivity for adsorbing (cap- 
turing) and storing CO 
2 increases with controlling their pore size 
[143] . In an isoreticular series of eight ZIFs, there are precisely con- 
trolled  metrics  and  functionality  with  the  desirable  topology.  In 
these eight series of ZIFs, the diameter of pores varies from 7.1 to 
15.9 A °. The pore size and surface area have a dominant effect on 
the selectivity of CO 
2 capture from other gases as shown in Fig. 9 
[143] . 

Another  strategy  for  tuning  the  pore  size  is  controlling 
the  interpenetration  of  the  framework  in  MOFs.  Some  MOFs 
like  Zn(abdc)(bpee)0.5  and  Ni(cyclam)2(mtb)  (cyclam = 1,4,8,

and selectivity. UiO-66-NH 
2 on reaction with dianhydrides resulted 
in  anhydrides  on  the  MOF’s  surface  which  on  reaction  with  di- 
amines get imidized and subsequently resulted in polyimide (PI) 
coating on the MOF surface which is effective for membrane for- 
mation for up to 88% w/w MOF. The mechanical properties of the 
resulting MMM were improved by covalently attaching the MOF 
and polymer and simultaneously enhanced both the CO 
2  perme- 
ability and selectivity [156] . Yaghi and co-workers [133] explored 
another route towards high CO 
2 adsorption aﬃnity in SIFSIX-3-Zn. 
They introduced polarizable inorganic anions with narrowed pore 
sizes to enhance the selectivity towards CO 
2 . A small pore size of 
only 3.84 A ° in the one-dimensional square channel allowed se- 
2 , in 
2 adsorption, even for the mixture of 10% CO 
lective CO 
dry and wet conditions. The functionalization of MOFs with nar- 
row pore sizes for gas separation is a promising strategy for gas 
capture in conﬁned space and is an ongoing highly active ﬁeld of 
research [133] .

5.3. Introducing heterocyclic ligands 

CO 

2  adsorption  in  some  MOFs  can  be  enhanced  by  the  in- 
2  adsorption  in  four  UiO 
troduction  of  heterocyclic  ligands.  CO 
type MOFs can be enhanced using sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen as 
heterocyclic  ligands.  The  CO 
2  adsorption  in  several  MOFs  like  N 
[UiO(BPYDC))], S (Zr-BTDC), and O (Zr-BFDC) were studied. It was 
observed that these MOFs consist of heterocyclic ligand which is 
beneﬁcial for enhancing the adsorption capacity of the MOFs to- 
ward CO 
2 adsorp- 
2 . Their parent MOF, UiO-67, exhibited lower CO 
tion capacities than those modiﬁed MOFs having heterocyclic lig- 
ands in their structures. Among all these modiﬁed MOFs of UiO- 
67, O-heterocyclic ligand O (Zr-BFDC) has the highest adsorption 
capacity and is about 4 times greater than its parent MOF, UiO- 

2  over  N 

67 [157] . Fig. 11 shows the geometries of the ligands and crystal 
structures of the modiﬁed MOFs. Recently, Asghari et al. [158] re- 
ported insights on how ligand functionalization inﬂuences the CO 
2 
adsorption  capacity  and  selectivity  for  sodalite  MOFs,  Cu-BTTri 
(BTTri −3 = 1,3,5-benzenetristriazolate) and Cu-BTT (BTT −3 = 1,3,5- 
bfenzenetristetrazolate). It was observed that adsorption capacity 
and enthalpy of adsorption are remarkably higher for Cu-BTT than 
Cu-BTTri.  However,  Cu-BTTri  exhibited  a  strong  aﬃnity  towards 
CO 
2  as  compared  to  Cu-BTT,  as  triazolate  offers  strong 
metal to ligand bond, compared to its counterpart, which weak- 
ens its interactions with smaller molecules. It was also found that 
triazolate is a better electron donor than tetrazolate as evidenced 
by marginally stretched distance between Cu 2 + sites and surface- 
bound CO 
2 in Cu-BTTri [158] . Furthermore, Kazemi and Safarifard 
[159]  demonstrated  that due to  increased  host  to  guest  interac- 
tions ligand functionalization enhances the CO 
2  uptake capacities 
without disturbing the general structure of MOFs. However, reduc- 
tion in the porosity, as functional groups take up some void space, 
can have a detrimental effect on overall performance. Therefore, 
these competing factors should be balanced to maximize the CO 
2 
adsorption capacity in MOFs.

2 S and CO 

A key challenge in processing industrial gases is the controlling 
2 S, which are both hazardous to the environment. So 
of CO 
2 and H 
simultaneous CO 
2 S removal is of great concern as the re- 
moval of these gases are challenging because of more energy con- 
sumption, corrosion formation, adsorbent poisoning [163–168] . To 
address these concerns, Belmabkhout et al. [163] studied simulta- 
2 removal from natural gas. It was observed that 
neous H 
SIFSIX-3-Ni  and  NbOFFIVE-1-Ni  MOFs  are  selective  towards  CO 
2 
2 S selectivity greater than 1. Similarly, AIFFIVE-1-Ni 
having CO 
2 /H 
2 from various gas streams of dif- 
can also adsorb both H 
ferent concentrations and compositions with a wide range of tem- 
2 AIFFIVE-1- 
peratures. For simultaneous adsorption of H 
Ni showed H 
2 S se- 
lectivity > 1, a ﬂuorinated MOF, SIFSIX-3-Ni (Pyrazine), was stud- 
4 : 5/5/90 column 
ied. It was aﬃrmed that selectivity in H 
breakthrough  mixed-gas  test  was  in  favor  of  CO 
2 .  Furthermore, 
NbOFFIVE-1-Ni, was reported as an effective ﬂuorinated MOF for 
2 capture at low concentrations. NbOFFIVE-i-Ni is more selective 
CO 
2 by the comparison of separate and combined reten- 
towards CO

5.6. Regeneration and recycling 

In most cases, the use of new adsorbent materials instead of 
used  and  recycled  materials  is  not  economically  acceptable.  For 
the economical use of adsorbent material, it should be regenerated 
by  some  means  like  reducing  the  partial  pressure  of  adsorbate, 
lowering the concentration or purging with an inert gas [53 , 133] .

shows recyclability of binary MOF, UiO-66/Cu-BTC, used as a cat- 
alyst  in  the  cycloaddition  reaction  of  ECH  (Epichlorohydrin)  and

5.7. Ozonolysis of micropores to mesopores in MOFs 

Increasing the storage capacity of MOFs and encapsulation of 
larger  size  molecules  still  remains  a  challenge  in  the  chemistry 
of MOFs [170] . In this method, ligands with non-terminal oleﬁns 
group can selectively be cleaved and removed from MOFs. It is a 
controllable post-synthetic way of converting micropores to meso- 
pores [170 , 171] . This system is valid only to those MOFs having lig- 
and pairs of similar shape and length and also of similar reactivity 
under given conditions but opposite reactivity with ozone. For this, 
4,4-azobenzene dicarboxylic acid (H 
2 azo) and 4,4-stilbenzene di- 
carboxylic acid (H 
2 sti) were selected as ligand pairs for the Zr-fcu- 
MOF, having post-synthetic modiﬁcation and ozone resistant ability 
[170 , 172] . Resultant MOFs, Zr-fcu-azo, and Zr-fcu-sti, were achieved 
and set for testing by ozonolysis. For this testing, MOFs were sus- 
pended in ZnCl 
4 and N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) in the pres- 
ence of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and L -proline. The resulting mix- 
ture then heated in a scintillation vial at 120 °C for the night. After 
heating, Zr-fcu-azo and Zr-fcu-sti mixture of crystals was washed

for Zr-fcu-sti as 3025 m 2 /g [170] . Furthermore, both crystals were 
exposed  to  ozone  for  30  min.  After  treatment  with  ozone,  Zr- 
fcu-azo retained its crystallinity and porosity while Zr-fcu-sti lost 
its  crystallinity  and  porosity  and  converted  into  non-porous  and 
amorphous  solid  because  of  the  cleavage  of  all  ligands.  Fig.  15 
shows the conversion of microporous to mesoporous by ozonoly- 
sis [170] . Although ozonolysis reduced the apparent surface area 
for ozonated Zr-fcu-azo/sti-30% from 30 0 0 to 2680 m 2 /g, the de- 
crease in surface area was compensated by an increase in the pro- 
portion of mesopores (15% vs 2%) and total pore volume from 1.24 
to 1.36 m 3 /g. Similarly, the total pore volume for Zr-fcu-azo/sti-40% 
was increased from 1.27 to 1.44 m 3 /g, despite the decreased sur- 
face area of 2580 m 2 /g vs. 3040 m 2 /g, after post-synthetic solid–
gas ozonolysis [170] . 

6. MOFs as ﬁller in mixed-matrix membranes 

MOFs are also well known for adding functionality in MMMs as 
ﬁllers for boosting the separation eﬃciency of MMMs [173–180] . 
For polymeric membranes in the gas separation applications, usu- 
ally, a trade-off between selectivity and permeability appears due 
to the nature of polymer materials [181–187] . Consequently, micro- 
porous ﬁllers as MOFs are used to address this problem [188 , 189] . 
For instance, Liu et al. [190] showed an enhancement in the per- 
meability and selectivity of 6FDA-DAM PI membrane by incorpo- 
rating  Y-fum-fcu-MOF  as  ﬁller  materials  for  CO 
4  separation 
at a temperature range of 233–338 K. By lowering the tempera- 
4 selectivity of 
tures from 308 to 233 K resulted in highest CO

al. [191] studied eight distinct composites of MOFs (ZIF-94, MIL- 
96(Al), MIL-69(Al), and NH 
2 -MIL-53(Al)) with two polymers (Pebax 
and 6FDA-DAM) as matrices. The MIL-96(Al), at an optimum load- 
ing of 25%, exhibited the best performance by improving the se- 
lectivity up to 18 and 10% for Pebax and 6FDA-DAM, respectively. 
In addition, permeability was also enhanced up to 32 and 25% for 
Pebax and 6FDA-DAM, respectively. Fig. 16 illustrates that the in- 
teraction of various dimensionalities of porosity and topology of 
MOFs with a continuous polymer phase pushes the MMMs closer 
to the upper bound limit.

Shen et  al.  [192] described the effect of  MOF loading on the 
separation performance of UiO-66-PEBA MMMs and observed that 
with increasing the UiO-66 loading up to 7.5 wt% the CO 
2 perme- 
2 selectivity simultaneously increased. With fur- 
ability and CO 
ther  increase  in  UiO-66  loading,  the  CO 
2  permeability  enhanced 
2  selectivity reduced because of intense agglomeration 
but CO 
of UiO-66 particles. The CO 
2 selectivity dropped to 20 upon the 
addition of 20 wt% UiO-66, which is lower than the pure PEBA se- 
lectivity 42.1 ± 1.9. Likewise, UiO-66-NH 
2 -PEBA MMM also showed 
similar  changes  in  CO 
2  selectivity  (80) 
2  permeability  and  CO 
because of the amino-functionalized structure as compared to that 
of UiO-66-PEBA (7.5) [192] . Aykac Ozen and Ozturk [193] observed 
4 selectivity as a 
2 permeability and CO 
a trade-off between CO 
consequence of transmembrane pressure for different MOFs with 
PI MMMs and discerned that feed pressure increased the perme- 
ability of the gas but reduced the selectivity.

7.5 wt% MOF loading in the MOF-801/PEBA MMM resulted in CO 
2 
permeation  of  22.4  GPU  and  CO 
2  selectivity  of  66  in  a  mix- 
ture  of  gases  [83] .  Liu  et  al.  prepared  an  MMM  with  the  in- 
corporation  of  Cu-BDC  MOF  nanosheets  and  commercially  avail- 
able poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEO–PBT) 
copolymer. Interestingly, the results showed that the addition of 
Cu-BDC nanosheets in the MMMs enhanced the CO 
2 selectivity 
to 77. The main function of the nanosheets addition was to cover 
up the defects during the formation of the thin membrane [195] . 
Prasetya et al. [196] found that the incorporation of azobenzene 
into UiO-66 MOF results in a low-energy CO 
2  adsorbent for en- 
hancing CO 
2 selectivity. Loading of azoben-

Thur et al. [197] incorporated UiO-67 and its bipyridine deriva- 
tive in a polyamide membrane to produce an MMM with enhanced 
CO 
4  selectivity.  An  optimum  concentra- 
tion  of  bipyridine  of  33%  was  reported  at  which  the  selectivity 
and  permeability  of  the  MOF  increased  100%  and  63%,  respec- 
tively.  Furthermore,  Li  et  al.  [198]  studied  amine-functionalized 
MOF like NH 
2 -UiO-66 incorporated 
in PI. MMMs showed a continuous and compact structure of the 
MMM because of hydrogen bonding between NH

ied the inﬂuence of MOF as ﬁller and polymer on the performance 
of  MMM  and  developed  different  MMMs  using  MOFs  like  NH 
2 - 
MIL-53(Al), MIL-69(Al), MIL-96(Al), and ZIF-94 with 25 wt% load- 
ing in polymers (6FDA-DAM and Pebax) for CO 
2 . In the case of

6FDA-DAM-based MMM, the NH 
2 -MIL-53(Al), MIL-96(Al), and ZIF- 
2 permeability relative 
94 showed 35%, 32% and 42% improved CO 
to 780 Barrer for pristine 6FDA-DAM, respectively. In the case of 
Pebax-based MMM, the MIL-96(Al), and ZIF-94 showed enhanced 
permeability of 25% and 33% relative to 44 Barrer for neat Pebax, 
respectively. The improved solubility of CO 
2 in the MMMs caused 
a slight enhancement in the selectivity. The performance of the as- 
prepared MMMs is very close to the Robeson upper-bound limit 
for CO

7. MOFs in catalytic conversion of CO 2 

MOFs  are  also  considered  effective  catalysts  in  catalytic  con- 
2  like  conversion  to  fuels,  cycloaddition, 
version  reactions  of  CO 
hydrogenation, and photoreduction of CO 
2 . Zhang et al. [199] re- 
ported  the  development  of  a  MOF  catalyst  for  the  reduction  of 
CO 
2  to methanol under ambient conditions for the ﬁrst time. In- 
corporation of imidazolium bromide-based linker to a MOF con- 
taining metal-free n-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) results in an NHC- 
functionalized  MOF,  UiO-68-NHC.  The  resultant  MOF  causes  the 
2  resulting  in  a  high  ( > 
transfer  of  hydrogen  from  silanes  to  CO 
99%) yield of methanol. In addition, MOF-immobilized NHC cata- 
lyst exhibited a product yield of 90% after recycling for eight cycles 
with high selectivity towards the desired product, silyl methoxide. 
Yang et al. [75] synthesized MOF based on Ni 
3 O cluster which cat- 
2 with epoxide to cyclic car- 
alytically effective for conversion of CO 
bonates without losing catalytic activity even on recycling 5 times. 
Guo [200] developed a 2D Cu(II) based MOF, [(Cu 
2 BPDSDC.4DMF). 
2DMF] n , which shows good heterogeneous catalytic properties for 
CO 
2  cycloaddition reactions. Besides exhibiting high catalytic  ac- 
tivity,  the  synthesized  MOF  could  be  recycled  and  reused  for  at 
least four times without signiﬁcant changes in its eﬃciency. The 
PXRD pattern of the reused MOF and its recyclability are shown in 
Fig. 17 (a) and (b), respectively [200] . 

Furthermore, Kurisingal et al. [78] demonstrated the synthesis 
of a binary MOF, Cu-BTC/Zr-UiO-66, for cycloaddition reaction of

CO 
reaction of CO 
2 and epichlorohydrin (ECH) was carried out in the 
presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a co-catalyst. 
Results reveal excellent conversion of ECH with > 99% selectivity of 
ECH carbonate caused by the combination of Zr and Cu from MOFs 
while Br ion from TBAB. The synthesized binary MOF showed bet- 
ter recyclability with no loss in catalytic activity even after recy- 
cling for six times. Recyclability of the binary catalyst, UiO-66/Cu- 
2 pressure, 0.06 g 
BTC, for test conditions (60 °C, 8 h, 1.2 MPa CO 
(0.16 mol%) UiO-66/Cu-BTC, 0.5 mol% co-catalyst, 25 mmol of ECH) 
is shown in Fig. 17 (b) while conversion and selectivity of the dif- 
ferent tested MOFs and binary catalysts are listed in Table 6 . 

In  addition,  Xiang  et  al.  [79]  showed  that  dual-ligand  ZIF-8- 
2  and  ECH  with- 
90  results  in  an  eﬃcient  cycloaddition  of  CO 
out  using  a  solvent  and  co-catalyst.  The  dual-ligand  ZIF  shows 
enhanced  stability  and  improved  selectivity  as  compared  to  ZIF- 
8  with  no  signiﬁcant  loss  in  catalytic  activity  upon  three  times 
of recycling. Agarwal et al. [80] also synthesized a 2D tetragonal 
2 O} n , with the incor- 
porous MOF, {[Zn 
poration of 1,3,5-tri(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)benzene (TBIB) and 
1,3,5-Tris(4 (cid:3) -carboxyphenyl-)benzene (H 
3 TCPB), which can be used 
for eﬃcient cycloaddition of CO 
2 to result in the formation of cyclic 
carbonates. The presence of free -COOH and –C = O groups make it 
an excellent catalyst without activating the compounds.

Wang et al. [203] synthesized MOF for photoconversion of CO

combination  of  Cu(II)tetra(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin  (CuTCPP)

4 generation of 
about 7 times higher than that of pure TiO 
0.148 μmol/gh. Furthermore, the as-prepared CTU/TiO

an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO

high selectivity towards methane production in an electrochemi- 
cal reduction reaction of CO 
2 . The resulting MOF shows 2.3 times 
methane production and enhanced Faradic eﬃciency ( > 50%) than 
commercial Cu NPs. Liu et al. [81] also investigated the develop- 
ment of a two steps self-assembly process for functionalizing phos- 
phorescent MOF for photocatalytic reduction of CO 
2 to syngas (CO 
2 ) with the use of photosensitizers and obtained a yield of

13,600 μmol/g (H 
CO 
2 to CO in MOF-74 can be selectively increased by incorporating 
Au@Pd nanoparticles in MOF-74 with loading Pt nanoparticles into 
its surface. The catalytic activities of the resultant nano-catalysts, 
Au@Pd@MOF-74, Pt/MOF-74, and Pt/Au@Pd@MOF-74 were checked 
by reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction and photocatalytic re- 
action. The results showed 100% selectivity of Pt/MOF-74 for cat- 
2  conversion,  whereas  Au@Pd@MOF-74  results  in  100% 
alyzed  CO 
selectivity for CO 
2 photoreduction to CO. Besides, Pt/Au@Pd@MOF- 
74  shows  nearly  100%  selectivity  for  both  RWGS  reaction  and

7.1. Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by MOFs 

MOFs  are  known  to  provide,  as  photocatalytic  semiconductor 
materials,  both  light-harvesting  function  through  organic  ligands 
and metal clusters as active catalytic sites making them feasible 
for  the  photocatalytic  activity  for  CO 
2  conversion  [211 , 212] .  The 
organic ligands facilitate the broad-band light absorption through 
π – π ∗ transition of ligands, the ligand to metal charge transfer, 
and metal to ligand charge transfer [213 , 214] . The charge carriers 
generated by organic ligands activate metal centers to take part in 
conversion reactions. The porous structure of MOFs and the tune- 
ability of light harvesters and catalytic sites make them promising 
photocatalysts for CO 
2 conversion [214] . Here we will discuss the 
recent advances in the functionalization of MOFs to enhance their 
photocatalytic performance for CO 

2 conversion.

structured  photocatalyst  composites  to  address  the  optimization

speciﬁc metal Lewis sites for photo-reduction of CO 
eration rate of 28.6 μmol g −1 h −1 with 99% selectivity for CO was 
obtained without using any sacriﬁcial agents [215] . Likewise, an-

prepared by in-situ fabrication to enhance the photocatalytic eﬃ- 
ciency by improving the electron transfer and inhibition of charge 
recombination. The composite exhibited 1.7 times higher activity

have recently studied porphyrin paddle-wheel frameworks-3 (PPF-

The  light-harvesting  properties  of  MOFs  can  be  enhanced  by

The  high  photocatalytic  activity  was  attributed  to  the  synergic 
effect  of  enriched  photoelectron  harvesting  and  charge  transi- 
tion  on  rGO,  the  well-aligned  energy  levels  among  photosensi- 
tizer and rGO/Ni 
2 , and the improved activity of metal cen- 
ters [220 , 221] . Wu et al. [222] improved the light-harvesting prop- 
erties of Fe-porphyrin based MOF PCN-221 by incorporating quan- 
tum dots of CH 
3 perovskite in the pores. The encapsulation 
also aided in the stability of quantum dots and improved separa- 
tion eﬃciency by shortening the charge transfer path. The photo- 
catalytic activity was 38 folds higher than the pristine MOF [222] . 
Similarly, Ding et al. [223] impregnated MIL-101(Cr) with CdS NPs

To  cognize  the  speciﬁc  inﬂuence  of  metal-ions  and  reac- 
tion  mechanisms  of  photocatalytic  conversion  of  CO 
2 ,  a  sim- 
ple  but  exact  structural  model  of  MOFs  is  of  primary  impor- 
tance.  Wang  et  al.  [208]  probed  MOFs  having  monometallic  ac- 
tive centers – {M 
2 (1,2-di(4- 
3 } n where M is Cu (MOF-Cu), Co (MOF-Co) 
pyridyl)ethylene) 
and  Ni  (MOF-Ni)  – to  undermine  the  complications  due  elusive 
and intricate reaction mechanism arising from collective involve- 
ment of numerous active centers within the metal clusters in dis- 
cerning the catalytic ability of single active site. The MOFs with 
different catalytic active centers produced distinct effects on selec- 
tivity  and  yield  of  reductive  products  as  listed  in  Table  8  [208] . 
In contrast, Wei et al. [224] studied the effect of charge-donating 
and charge-withdrawing functional groups on the photo-reduction 
of CO 
2 to CO on zirconium frameworks. It was conﬁrmed that the 
charge-donating functional groups are more effective due to lower 
charge  separation  resistance  than  charge-withdrawing  functional 
groups  [224] .  Dao  et  al.  [225]  prepared  an  amine-functionalized 
2 -MIL-101(Fe), to employ a solvent-free route for reduc- 
MOF, NH 
2 to CO at the gas-solid interface. A superior selectivity 
tion of CO 
and conversion rate of 17.52 μmol g −1 h −1 was attained [225] .

7.2. Electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 by MOFs 

MOFs are of particular interest in the electrocatalytic conver- 
sion of CO 
2  due to their peculiar characteristics like presence, at 
molecular or even atomic scale, of homogenously segregated active 
sites  from tunable inorganic and organic SBUs, and  high surface 
areas to facilitate the high activity, selectivity, and stability [226] . 
Moreover, MOFs also incite exciting conﬁnement effects like limit- 
ing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and boosting the selec- 
2 reduction products. For example, by conﬁning Al cen- 
tivity of CO 
ters in MIL-53 (MIL-53(Al)) electrochemical reduction of CO 
2 to CO 
and formic acid was incredibly improved, resulting in a cumulative 
faradic eﬃciency (FE) of 40%, while limiting the HER activity of cat- 
alyst [227] . As discussed before, another strategy for increasing cat- 
alytic activity is the doping of electron-donating ligands. The elec- 
trocatalytic activity, towards CO production of ZIF-8, was boosted 
by doping of electron donor molecule 1,10-phenanthroline (ZIF-A- 
LD) [228] . The authors ascribed improved performance of ZIF-A- 
LD to the charge transfer effect and  ∗COOH formation facilitated 
by electron-donating ligand. The electrocatalytic performance was 
further improved by improving electron transfer through the ad- 
dition of conductive ﬁller (ZIF-A-LD/CB) as listed in Table 9 [228] . 
Similarly, Yang et al. [229] demonstrated the cooperation between 
ZIF-90 and molecular catalyst cobalt phthalocyanine by synthesiz- 
ing a hybrid (CoTAPc–ZIF-90) using Schiff base reaction. The hy- 
brid exhibited high electrocatalytic CO 
2 reduction activity in aque- 
ous media with a faradic eﬃciency of 90% and an overpotential of 
0.86 V at a current density of 13 mA cm −2 and an optimum mass 

2 O in Cu 

loading of 30 mg of CoTAPc and 100 mg of ZIF-90 [229] . Likewise, 
Tan et al. [230] combined the high adsorption capacity of Cu-MOF 
and the inherent catalytic activity of Cu 
2 O@Cu-MOF elec- 
2 conversion into hydrocarbons. 
trocatalytic system for selective CO 
The synergic effects of combining Cu 
2 O and Cu-MOF like large sur- 
face area, numerous unsaturated coordination active sites, and fast 
charge transfer resulted in FE of 79.4% with notable FE of 63.2% 
for CH 
4 . Albo et al. [231] explored the performance of a bimetal- 
lic (Cu(II) and Bi(III)) blend of MOFs, HKAUST-1, and CAU-17, sup- 
ported on porous carbon paper for electrocatalytic conversion of 
2 to alcohols. It was observed the composition and current den- 
CO 
sity affect the production of alcohol and selectivity, respectively. At 
Bi content of 12% optimum production of alcohol (at FE 
alcohols  of 
36.9%) was obtained with higher selectivity towards methanol (at 
FE 
ethanol  of 28.3%) at current 
densities of 10 mA cm −2 and 20 mA cm −2 , respectively [231] .

We encourage, based on reported data, further investigation of 
effects of substituents in organic ligands on the catalytic activity

mechanism to understand the role of metal centers in CO 
tion. As discussed by Lee et al. [227] , further investigation of con- 
ﬁnement effects of metal centers in MOFs that promote proton re- 
duction is also recommended for CO 
2  conversion. Another feasi- 
ble direction to explore is the incorporation of these MOFs in the 
2 conversion. We are of the 
membrane for continuous gas-phase CO 
view that detailed theoretical studies employing density functional 
theory  (DFT)  and  extensive  review  of  current  literature  must  be 
conducted before performing experimental studies to rationally de- 
sign high-performance MOFs based materials for CO 
2 capture and 
subsequent conversion. 

8. Economics of MOFs-based CO 2 capture 

The cost of capturing CO 

2 using MOFs is a signiﬁcant challeng- 
ing factor to adopt MOFs at industrial scale and for commercial- 
ization of the technology. The major focus of research, in the past 
2 capture from ﬂue gases 
decades, for developing the MOFs for CO 
was to minimize the Cost of Electricity (COE). This was deemed 
conceivable by synthesizing the best MOFs by improving the hy- 
drothermal stability and increase the CO 
2 capacity [233 , 234] . How- 
ever, overall cost includes the cost of production of MOFs, adsorp- 
2 and regeneration of MOFs. The cost 
tion and desorption cost of CO 

26 

M. Younas, M. Rezakazemi and M. Daud et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100849 

of raw materials for the synthesis of MOFs is of primary concern, 
however, it is still much higher than that of conventional adsor- 
bents like zeolites and activated carbon. Hu et al. [53] attributed 
the  relatively  high  cost  of  raw  materials  for  MOFs  to  the  non- 
availability of industrial-scale manufacturing facilities. The synthe- 
sis procedure of MOFs involves the time-consuming batch opera- 
tion with costly organic solvents and complicated separation tech- 
niques. DeSentis et al. [235] conducted a techno-economic analysis 
to understand the major drivers of the production cost of MOF ad- 
sorbents (Ni-MOF-74, Mg-MOF-74, MOF-5, HKAUST-1) and identify 
opportunities for cost reduction. The cost of the solvent involved in 
synthesis was found to be of major inﬂuence on the baseline cost. 
For instance, shifting from widely utilized solvothermal synthesis 
to aqueous synthesis and liquid assisted grinding was estimated to 
reduce the cost by 34–83% lower to 13–$36/kg from the baseline 
cost of 35–75$/kg. 

Another important parameter in the selection of adsorbent for 
2 capture is the heat capacity (Cp) – as it contributes to regener- 
CO 
ation costs – that is expected to impact considerably the eﬃciency 
of this process. Although the alkanolamines have been proved to 
be  a  good  sorbent  widely  used  for  CO 
2  absorption  at  industrial 
scale,  MOFs  have  exhibited  the  marginal  low  values  of  heat  ca- 
pacities as compared to alkanolamines. Thus, the use of MOFs as 
replacement  of  alkanolamines  offers  a  lower  energy  penalty  in 
the regeneration of MOFs which would ultimately reduce the to- 
tal  energy  cost  for  post-combustion  CO 
2  capture  [54] .  The  typi- 
cal values of heat capacities for different alkanolamine solutions 
are compared with a MOF in Fig. 18 . As observed, the heat capac- 
ity values of MOF-177 are considerably lower than those of MEA 
and DEA solutions. The high values of the heat capacity of alka- 
nolamine solutions are that these solutions are dissolved in water 
2 . For 
which must be heated to the desorption temperature of CO 
example,  for  a  10  wt%  DEA  solution,  the  heat  capacity  at  25  °C 
is 3.923 Jg −1  K −1 , which is close to the corresponding value for 
pure water (4.18 Jg −1 K −1 at 25 °C), and is more than four times 
larger  than  the  heat  capacities  of  the  MOFs  studied  here  [236] . 
2 (dobpdc)  and 
Moreover,  researchers  have  investigated  mmen-Mg 
mmen-Mn 
2 (dobpdc) which exhibited a cooperative mechanism for 
CO 
2  capture-and-release  with  only  small  shifts  in  temperature. 
These MOFs were estimated to achieve considerably lower regener- 
2 ) than monoethanolamine [237] . 
ation energy (2.2–2.3 MJ/kg of CO 
Though Sumida et al. [54] showed that the value of heat capacity 
linearly increases with the temperature, it is still much lower for 
MOF than those of amine solutions at each value of temperature. 
Control  over  the  enthalpy  of  adsorption  ( (cid:4)H)  for  MOF-based 
adsorbents  is  another  avenue  for  exploration.  For  instance,  Mg- 
MOF-74  exhibited  high  ( (cid:4)H)  due  to  unsaturated  metal  sites.  To 
deal with this limitation, Queen et al. [239] investigated analogs 
of  MMOF-74  to  control  the  interactions  between  CO 
2  and  metal 
sites. It was observed that Zn-, Mn-, Fe-, and Co-MOF-74 are more 
suitable than Mg-MOF-74. Partial metal substitution is also a suc- 
cessful technique to achieve ﬁner control [240] . Another approach 
to control the enthalpy of adsorption is the implanting of organic 
molecules  like  mono  or  single-ended  amines  to  the  metal  sites 
[241,242] . In contrast, UTSA-16 and ZMOFs host charge-balancing 
ions (K + ) in the framework which can be replaced with Li + or Cs + 
to  control  the  adsorption  enthalpy  by  manipulating  the  interac- 
tions of CO 
2 with the adsorbent [243–245] . Danaci et al. [243] de- 
veloped an adsorbent screening tool and evaluated 22 MOFs uti- 
lizing process economics against performance constraints. It was 
observed  that  the  performance  of  UTSA-16  comparable  with  the 
benchmark ZIF-13X. It was also recognized that to improve pro- 
cess  performance,  CO 
2  selectivity  and  moderate  enthalpy  of  ad- 
sorption  are  of  vital  importance.  Fig.  19  illustrates  the  inﬂuence

9. Conclusion and future perspective 

CO 

2 separation from eﬄuent gas of power plants – to comply 
with  environmental  regulation  – and  its  storage  in  underground 
wells  or  conversion  to  useful  products  has  a  foreseeable  future. 
This  review  highlights  the  recent  advances  and  challenges  faced 
in post-combustion CO 
2  capture and mitigation through MOFs as 
adsorbents,  catalysts,  and  ﬁllers  in  MMMs.  It  also  provides  var- 
ious  strategies  for  enhancing  the  performance  of  MOFs  for  CO 
2 
capture, separation and catalytic conversion to overcome the chal- 
lenges to some extent. The stability (thermal, chemical, mechan- 
ical and hydrothermal) of the MOFs in harsh working conditions 
is  an  essential  factor  and  plays  a  vital  role  in  large  scale  eco- 
2  capture  and  mitigation.  Generally, 
nomical  use  of  MOFs  for  CO 
the superior strength of the bond between node and linker and a 
higher number of linkers connected to each node results in higher 
thermal stability [31] . Also, replacement of commonly used link- 
ers such as carboxylate group and divalent cations with equivalent 
oxyanion-terminated  trivalent  linker  cations  like  Al(3),  Zr(3)  and 
Ti(3) [86 , 95 , 96] – having high bond enthalpy and bond dissociation 
energy – also results in higher thermal stability. Furthermore, the 
hydrothermal  stability  of  MOFs  is  also  strongly  dependent  upon 
the node-linker bond strength of MOF. Those having a high heat of 
formation of the node-linker bond are hydrothermally more stable. 
It can also be increased by creating hydrophobic surfaces by re- 
placing hydrogen atoms in ligands with ﬂuorine [102 , 121] . When it 
comes to mechanical stability, the physical structure of MOFs is of 
more importance – in deﬁning physical properties like elastic mod- 
uli, compressibility, and rigidity – than their chemical functional- 
ity. MOFs are known for their porous nature and it also counts for 
adsorption abilities, yet with an increase in the porosity of MOFs, 
their mechanical stability will be at stake. This instability of MOFs, 
upon mechanical loading, yields in the partial collapse of pores or 
even change of phase in MOFs. However, various studies show that 
MOFs ﬁlled with solvents are more mechanically stable [126 , 127] . 
It  was  also  found  that  with  increasing  the  coordination  number 
of metal or shortening the linker, the mechanical stability of the 
MOFs can be enhanced. Moreover, understanding where the CO 
2 
is bound inside these porous frameworks can be really helpful in 
designing materials that are both economically feasible and more 
eﬃcient. 

To compete with the use of renewable energy or green energy, 
excellent  capturing  and  storage  properties  are  required  of  such 
MOFs. The strategies such as ﬁxing pore size and shape in MOFs, 
functionalizing the pore surface in MOFs, introducing heterocyclic 
ligands, introducing amino group and other groups to Cd (II) MOFs, 
using ﬂuorinated MOFs with tuned adsorption selectivity, regener- 
ation, and recycling, and ozonolysis of MOFs can signiﬁcantly en- 
hance the CO 
2  adsorption 
2  capture properties of MOFs [170] . CO 
in some MOFs can be enhanced by the introduction of heterocyclic 
ligands. Furthermore, incorporation of amino groups, phenolic hy- 
droxyl groups, and nitro groups, results in improved sorption ca- 
2 of MOFs. MOFs are also 
pacity and higher selectivity towards CO 
well known for adding functionality in MMMs as ﬁllers for boost- 
ing the separation eﬃciency of MMMs. Loading of azobenzene is 
an effective option for MMMs to increase the aﬃnity of the MMM 
towards CO 
2  [196] . Technically, utilization of MOFs for mitigation 
2 emissions is a complex task, which requires a combination 
of CO 
of  carbon  capture,  separation and  catalytic  carbon  conversion  or 
long-term storage. 

In addition to CO

X  and NO 

2  present in ﬂue gas can compete with CO 

conversion  at  ambient conditions  can  be anticipated  as  CO 
2  can 
now be effectively converted into methanol at ambient conditions 
2 , selec- 
[199] . However, for direct solid-gas phase conversion of CO 
tivity of MOF-based catalyst needs to be further improved as water 
and N 
2  for adsorption 
sites. Moreover, the stability of MOFs in such a situation is also 
in question due to the presence of SO 
X . The slow mass 
transfer rates of conversion products in MOFs are also a hindrance 
in fast reaction kinetics which can be resolved through hierarchi- 
cal design of MOF catalysts. Another feasible direction to explore is 
the incorporation of these MOFs in the membrane for continuous 
2 conversion. In addition, more effort s are necessary 
gas-phase CO 
2  to elucidate the role 
to study the conversion mechanism of CO 
of metal centers in CO 
2  reduction and the effects of substituents 
in organic ligands on catalytic activity. Moreover, further investi- 
gation of conﬁnement effects of metal centers in MOFs that pro- 
mote proton reduction is also recommended for CO 
2 conversion –
as discussed by Lee et al. [227] . We are of the view that detailed 
theoretical studies employing DFT and data driven computational 
studies should be conducted before performing experimental in- 
vestigation to rationally design high-performance MOFs based ma- 
terials for CO 

2 capture and/or conversion. 
Although numerous studies can be found on CO 

2  capture and 
conversion by MOFs, limited literature is available concerning the 
2  capture and mitigation utilizing MOF- 
process economics of CO 
based systems. The cost of CO 
2 capture through MOFs is still high 
as compared to commercially utilized solvents like MEA. There is 
a stern need for coupling molecular-level characteristics of MOFs 
materials with process economics to design both technically and 
economically feasible MOF-based CO 
2 capture and mitigation sys- 
tems.
