Heterogeneous and combined hetero-/homogeneous chemical processes have attracted increased atten-
tion in many energy conversion systems, which include large-scale power generation, microreactors for
portable power generation, household burners, fuel-processing technologies and automotive exhaust gas
after treatment. Progress in such systems crucially depends on the development of catalysts with en-
hanced activity and thermal stability and on the comprehensive understanding of the fundamental pro-
cesses occurring near gas–solid reacting interfaces. Recent advances in non-intrusive lased-based mea-
surements of gas-phase thermoscalars over the catalyst boundary layer are reviewed. Such measurements,
combined with theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, have fostered fundamental investigations
of the catalytic and gas-phase chemical processes and their coupling at industrially-relevant operating
conditions. The methodology for assessing local catalytic reaction rates and validating gas-phase reaction
mechanisms under steady conditions using 1-D Raman and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of
radical species, respectively, is presented first. Progress in the measurement of minor and major stable
species using PLIF is outlined and the potential of this technique as a suitable method for assessing the
catalytic reactivity under dynamic operating conditions is discussed. State of the art numerical model-
ing necessary for the interpretation of the measurements is presented in parallel with the laser-based
techniques. Turbulence modeling, direct numerical simulation (DNS) and near-wall non-intrusive mea-
surements of species concentrations and velocity have clarified aspects of the complex interplay between
interphase turbulent transport and hetero-/homogeneous kinetics. Controlling parameters are the com-
petition between the heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction pathways, diffusional imbalance of the
deficient reactant, flow laminarization induced by the hot catalytic walls, and fuel leakage through the
gaseous reaction zone that leads to concurrent catalytic and gas-phase combustion. Experimental needs
for assessing turbulent fluctuations of catalytic reaction rates as well as for investigating intrinsic insta-
bilities (heterogeneously or homogeneously driven) are discussed. Future directions for combining in situ
surface science diagnostics with in situ non-intrusive gas-phase thermoscalar diagnostics and for advanc-
ing current numerical tools are finally proposed.

1. Introduction

1.1. Applications of heterogeneous and hetero-/homogeneous chemical
processes

Heterogeneous (catalytic) and combined heterogeneous and ho-
mogeneous  (gas-phase)  chemical  processes  are  of  main  interest
in many industrial applications which include fuel reforming and
synthesis of chemicals, microreactors for portable power genera-
tion, industrial and household burners, gas turbines for large-scale
power  generation,  exhaust  gas  aftertreatment  in  automotive  en-
gines and fuel cells. The progress in such systems entails the de-
velopment of catalysts with improved reactivity, stability and se-
lectivity, knowledge of the fundamental physicochemical processes
near catalytic surfaces and construction of multidimensional mod-
els with efficient solution algorithms that can be used for reactor
design and basic research.

el ) power plants. Pre-combustion CO

Hetero–/homogeneous  chemical  processes  are  especially  rele-
vant  for  new  hybrid  combustion  concepts  investigated  for  pre-
2  capture  in  large-scale  ( > 1
combustion  and  post-combustion  CO
MW
2 capture involves fuel de-
carbonization,  leading  to  very  reactive  hydrogen-containing  mix-
tures  [3,4] .  On  the  other  hand,  post-combustion  CO
2  capture  is
facilitated  with  large  flue  gas  recycle  (FGR)  [5]  which,  however,
reduces  the  mixture  reactivity.  The  enhanced  and  reduced  reac-
tivities  may  lead  to  flashback  and  blowout,  respectively.  These
undesirable phenomena can be mitigated by heterogeneous reac-
tions, as they have lower activation energies compared to gaseous
reactions  [6]  and  can  effectively  suppress  upstream  flame  prop-
agation  [7,8] .  Furthermore,  hybrid  combustion  concepts  lead  to

ultra-low  NOx  emissions  ( < 5 ppm)  since  the  catalytic  pathway
does not produce the gas-phase radicals driving the NOx forma-
tion chemistry [9,10] . Two hybrid approaches under investigation
are illustrated in Fig. 1 . In the catalytically stabilized thermal com-
bustion (CST) concept ( Fig. 1 (a)) [1,11–13] part of the fuel is con-
verted  heterogeneously  at  fuel-lean  stoichiometries  in  a  noble-
metal-coated honeycomb reactor, while the remaining is converted,
again  under  fuel-lean  stoichiometries,  in  a  post-catalyst  homo-
geneous  combustion  zone  ( Fig.  1 (a1)).  The  other  hybrid  concept
( Fig. 1 (b)) is the catalytic-rich/gaseous-lean combustion, originally
developed for natural-gas-fueled turbines [14–17] . Part of the air
is  mixed  with  all  of  the  natural  gas,  leading  to  a  reactive  mix-
ture  with  a  fuel-rich  stoichiometry.  This  mixture  undergoes  cat-
alytic partial oxidation (CPO) to produce syngas in a reactor com-
prising a bundle of tubes externally-coated with a noble metal cat-
alyst ( Fig. 1 (b1)); a subscale unit with a single catalytic tube of the
entire bundle is shown in Fig. 1 (b2). The syngas and the uncon-
verted reactants are then mixed with the remaining air establish-
ing an overall fuel-lean homogeneous combustion zone; as shown
by the OH planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) instantaneous
flame image in Fig. 1 (b3)). This approach can also be applied to
syngas or hydrogen fuels [2,18] , in which case the catalytic module
does not have a main CPO function but only facilitates the stabi-
lization of the follow-up gaseous combustion zone. The concepts in
Fig. 1 (a, b) have designated separate heterogeneous and homoge-
neous combustion zones, with the latter stabilized (thermally and
chemically) by the products of the former. However, under the high
operating pressures of modern gas turbines (up to 30 bar) it is not
always possible to avoid vigorous gas-phase combustion (flame for-
mation) inside the catalytic reactors in Fig. 1 (a1) or (b1), despite

tios)  [19,20] .  Off-design  gaseous  combustion  inside  the  catalytic
module  can  be  detrimental  to  the  catalyst  and  reactor  integrity
and thus of interest for safety reasons, but can also be beneficial
depending on the fuel type and the specific application [13,21,22] .
el )  have  been  studied  for  decentral-
ized and portable power generation due to their superior energy
density  compared  to  state-of-the-art  batteries  [25,26] .  Most  mi-
croreactors  employ  heterogeneous  combustion  [27–29] ,  a  result
of  the  large  surface-to-volume  ratios  of  such  systems  that  favor
catalytic surface reactions over gaseous volumetric reactions and
the  presence  of  a  multitude  of  undesirable  flame  instabilities  in
non-catalytic wall-bounded flows [30–35] . Catalytic microreactors
based on recuperative micro-turbines ( Fig. 2 ) operate at pressures
up to ∼5 bar [23,36] . Even at such moderate pressures gas-phase
ignition can occur inside the catalytic module [37,38] . Another im-
portant application is gas-to-liquid (GTL) compact conversion sys-
tems (catalytic steam reforming of natural gas to syngas, followed
by Fischer–Tropsch, F–T, synthesis of liquid fuels), which are nowa-
days used in offshore oil and gas platforms to mitigate gas-flaring
emissions [39] ( Fig. 3 (a))). In autothermal operation, heat for the
endothermic  steam  reforming  is  supplied  by  catalytically  com-
busting part of the natural gas or the produced liquid fuel [40] .
There  are  certain  design  advantages  in  carrying  out  reforming/

combustion and F–T at the elevated pressures (up to 50 bar) dic-
tated by the downstream F–T process. High-pressure operation, in
turn, accentuates homogeneous ignition inside the catalytic com-
bustion module leading to hetero-/homogeneous combustion. Re-
forming of natural gas in small decentralized applications can also
be  achieved  by  CPO.  Therein,  the  very  reactive  hydrogen  prod-
uct can promote homogeneous combustion inside the CPO reactor
even at moderate pressures [41] . Finally, catalytic processes have
extended application in the exhaust gas aftertreatment of automo-
tive [42] ( Fig. 3 (b)) or stationary power plants [43] . Even though
this low-temperature and nearly isothermal application does not
entail vigorous homogeneous combustion (flames) inside the cat-
alytic module, its great impact in the mobility and energy sectors
warrants special attention.

1.2. Hetero-/homogeneous chemistry and transport coupling

ig,g  downstream of x

There  are  four  main  coupling  routes  between  the  heteroge-
neous and homogeneous reaction pathways, which are discussed
in the developing channel-flow configuration of Fig. 4 . Premixed
fuel/air is admitted in the catalytic channel, considering the fuel to
be the deficient reactant and the catalytic reaction to be exother-
mic. At a certain distance x
ig,c from the channel entry, which also
depends  on  heat  transfer  mechanisms  via  conduction  inside  the
solid  walls  and  surface  radiation,  the  catalytic  reactions  become
faster  than  the  transverse  transport  leading  to  catalytic  ignition.
Even though the incoming reactive mixture is fully premixed, cat-
alytic reactions form a degenerate diffusion reaction sheet [44] –
with  this  terminology  signifying  that  (contrary  to  gaseous  diffu-
sion flames) the sheet location is always fixed in space. As a result
of the higher energetic barrier of the homogeneous reaction path-
way, gas-phase combustion is ignited (conditions permitting) at a
position x
ig,c . The first mechanism of hetero-
/homogeneous  chemistry  coupling  is  the  promotion  of  homoge-
neous ignition due to the exothermicity of the catalytic pathway
that heats up the channel walls and consequently the flowing gas,
as shown by the transverse temperature profiles in Fig. 4 . At the
same time homogeneous ignition is inhibited by the near-wall de-
pletion of the deficient reactant ( Y
F  profiles). A third mechanism
of  coupling  is  via  the  major  species  produced  by  the  catalytic
pathway  over  the  gaseous  induction  zone  x < x
ig,g .  For  example,
catalytically-produced H
2 O chemically inhibits homogeneous igni-
2 /air mixtures [21,45] while it chemically promotes homo-
tion in H
geneous ignition in CH
4 /air mixtures [46] . The fourth mechanism
of coupling is via catalytic adsorption/desorption reactions of rad-
ical species. It has been shown, that while the catalytic pathway
is by itself a poor net source of radicals it can be a very efficient
sink of radicals when produced in large amounts by the gaseous
pathway  [19,45] .  In  other  words,  while  well-upstream  of  homo-
geneous ignition (where gas phase chemistry is practically frozen)
the catalytic radical fluxes are net-desorptive, over a portion of the
gaseous  induction  zone  close  to  x
ig,g  the  catalytic  radical  fluxes
shift  to  net-adsorptive  and  remain  so  in  the  post-ignition  zone
( x > x
ig,g ). The net effect is a moderate inhibition of homogeneous
ignition via the hetero-/homogeneous radical coupling [45,47] .

Catalytic  processes  are  greatly  impacted  by  fluid  mechan-
ical  transport.  Considering  infinitely-fast  chemistry,  in  gaseous
diffusion  flames  the  mass  fractions  of  both  fuel  and  oxidizer
identically  vanish  at  the  reaction  sheet.  However,  in  the  degen-
erate  diffusion  sheet  of  the  catalytic  pathway  the  inflexibility  of
the reaction zone to freely move allows only for the deficient re-
actant to vanish at the catalytic wall. Furthermore, it is not always
straightforward to identify the deficient reactant in catalytic reac-
tions, as it is controlled not only by the bulk gas-phase stoichiom-
etry  but  also  by  the  preferential  diffusion  of  fuel  and  oxidizer.

equalize species transport rates [49] and moderates the preferen-
tial diffusion effects, thus further compounding the identification
of the deficient reactant. Therefore, to correctly interpret the cat-
alytic processes, measurements of species concentrations over the
catalyst does not suffice and complementary simulations with re-
alistic transport are essential.

The catalytic pathway induces a strong transverse stratification
of the reactant and temperature distributions inside the channel
(see  Fig.  4 ),  greatly  impacting  homogeneous  ignition  and  flame
propagation.  This  mechanism,  when  coupled  to  enhanced  trans-
verse  transport  (e.g.  turbulent  flows)  can  lead  to  persisting  cat-
alytic reactant conversion even well-downstream the onset of ho-
mogeneous ignition ( x > x
ig,g ) [20,48,50] . Thus, combined catalytic
and  vigorous  gaseous  combustion  may  coexist  inside  a  catalytic
channel.  Such  simultaneous  chemical  processes  can  only  be  as-
sessed  with  spatially  resolved  measurements  inside  the  catalytic
reactor.

1.3. Non-intrusive diagnostics in catalytic reactors

The  development  of  validated  catalytic  and  low-temperature
gas-phase chemical reaction mechanisms is a key requirement for
the application of advanced multidimensional numerical models in
reactor design and in fundamental hetero-/homogeneous combus-
tion research. Construction of detailed (mean-field) catalytic reac-
tion mechanisms first entails theoretical calculations [51,52] to ob-
tain estimates of activation energies and reaction pre-exponentials
(by  means  of  Density  Functional  Theory  (DFT),  Transition  State
Theory  (TST)  and  Monte  Carlo  (MC)  methods)  along  with  semi-
empirical methods such as unity-bond index quadratic exponential
potential  (UBI-QEP)  and  Polanyi  expressions  [53–56] .  Identifica-
tion of the controlling surface species and extraction of basic ther-
modynamic data mostly rely on ultra-high vacuum (UHV) surface
science experiments [57,58] . Despite recent advances in operando
surface diagnostic techniques [59–61] , quantitative surface science

measurements  at  elevated  pressures  and  polycrystalline  surfaces
are  still  limited.  Even  if  the  local  surface  species  concentrations
can be deduced at realistic operating conditions, they cannot be
uniquely linked to quantities of engineering interest such as local
catalytic reaction rates of fuels or conversions of pollutants. Hence,
development of surface reaction mechanisms for technical catalysts
at realistic pressures, temperatures, and species compositions has
necessitated fine-tuning of kinetic parameters inferred by theoret-
ical calculations or UHV measurements and even modification of
the dominant reaction pathways (so as to bridge the well-known
“pressure and materials gap”) using experimental input from vari-
ous laboratory-scale catalytic reactors.

A commonly employed configuration is the nearly-isothermal,
annular  or  linear  differential  catalytic  steady  microflow  reactor
( Fig. 5 (a)) [63,64] . Therein, fuel and oxidizer heavily diluted with
an  inert  gas  (Ar)  flow  at  high  velocities  in  a  submillimeter  gap
coated with the catalyst of interest and the exit gas composition
is monitored with mass spectrometry and/or gas chromatography.
For a small reactant conversion ( ∼5%) and for plug flow species
profiles (no gradients in the transverse y -direction), a straightfor-
ward zero-dimensional equation can be written for the unknown

with   ̇ m the mass flux and L and H the reactor length and height,
respectively.  Key  limitation  of  microflow  reactors  is  the  moder-
ate  operating temperatures −typically  less  than  600 °C,  otherwise
excessive gas hourly spatial velocities, GHSV, are needed to alle-
viate transport limitations and ensure plug flow species profiles.
Moreover, this reactor cannot account for potential contributions of
gaseous chemistry since this would add a second unknown in the
right side of Eq. (1) . It is stressed that gaseous combustion cannot

always be ignored, especially at the elevated pressures of many in-
dustrial systems, despite the tight confinements of typical catalytic
reactors i.e. channels in honeycomb reactors or pores in foam reac-
tors with hydraulic diameters of ∼1 mm or less [17,19,20] . Finally,
the  isothermal  operation  does  not  allow  for  the  full  description
of certain processes (e.g. catalytic ignition) that can sometimes be
thermally controlled.

A  more  recent  methodology  for  kinetic  studies  involves
spatially-resolved 1-D (along the axial x -direction) measurements
of species concentrations and temperature in honeycomb or foam
catalytic reactors using a traversable capillary sampling tube with
outer diameter ∼0.2 mm, which is also equipped with a thermo-
couple  ( Fig.  5 (b))  [65–69] ;  a  review  on  such  measurements  in
given  in  [70] .  Accompanying  1-D  simulations  require  appropri-
ate lumped mass transfer coefficients (Sherwood numbers) [71,72] ,
which however are not unique in reacting systems. More impor-
tantly, the local state of the catalytic reactivity along the channel
walls cannot be quantitatively determined. The example drawn in
Fig. 5 (b) pertains to methane CPO, where the deficient reactant in
the oxidation zone is O
2 . At a given axial position the local cat-
alytic  oxygen  conversion  in  Fig.  5 (b)  can  be  transport-controlled
2 is practically zero at the catalytic walls,
(i.e. the mass fraction of O
as  shown  by  the  transverse  profile  Y
O2,3 ),  kinetically  controlled
(nearly uniform transverse profile Y
O2,1 ) or mixed kinetic/transport
controlled  (profile  Y
O2,2 ).  Even  though  1-D  axial  species  profiles
can roughly identify the extreme types of local catalytic conver-
sion (fully transport controlled versus fully kinetically controlled,
by  analyzing  the  rate  of  drop  of  the  deficient  reactant  concen-
tration  with  axial  distance  [65] ),  only  transverse  measurements
can unequivocally determine the exact state of catalytic reaction
and, in particular, the appearance of mixed kinetic/transport lim-
itations. As with the microflow reactor in Fig. 5 (a), the 1-D mea-
surements in Fig. 5 (b) cannot distinguish contributions from cat-
alytic and gaseous chemistry. 3-D CFD simulations with detailed
surface chemistry in a domain comprising several catalytic chan-
nels (each with a square cross section 0.8 × 0.8 mm 2 ) have shown
that the intrusive nature of the capillary can lead to large errors

174

J. Mantzaras / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 169–211

in the species concentrations, particularly at non-isothermal con-
ditions [73,74] . Assessment of errors due to gaseous chemistry has
not been addressed in these simulations. Recently, a capillary tube
with an outside diameter of 0.65 mm has been equipped with a
fiber optical microprobe for laser induced fluorescence (LIF) mea-
surements of radicals [62] ( Fig. 5 (c)). Application to the total ox-
idation  of  methane  on  a  Pt  gauge  is  shown  in  Fig.  5 (c),  where
stable species and OH radical concentration profiles are measured
perpendicularly to the Pt gauze with the capillary sampling tube
and  the  LIF  microprobe,  respectively.  Nonetheless,  the  device  in
Fig. 5 (c) is still intrusive and has not yet been applied to confined
geometries (foam or channels reactors as in Fig. 5 (b)).

Spatially-resolved  measurements  of  species  concentrations
along the direction normal to the catalyst, which are crucial for
assessing  the  local  catalytic  reactivity,  can  be  obtained  in  spe-
cial  laboratory  reactors.  Such  an  established  configuration  is  the
high-pressure,  optically  accessible  catalytic  channel-flow  reactor
[17,22,45–47,75] shown in Fig. 6 (a). The test rig includes a chan-
nel reactor and a cylindrical steel tank providing pressurizations
up  to  20 bar.  The  reactor  comprises  two  horizontal  Si[SiC]  non-
porous  ceramic  plates  (300 mm  long,  104 mm  wide,  9 mm  thick,
placed 7 mm apart) and two 3-mm-thick vertical quartz windows
( Fig. 6 (a)). The ∼15:1 cross-flow aspect ratio is sufficiently large to
allow for 2-D modeling along the x - y symmetry plane [45] . The in-
ner Si[SiC] surfaces are coated with the catalyst of interest, while
surface temperatures on both plates are monitored with thermo-
couples  (12  for  each  plate)  positioned  along  the  x - y  streamwise
symmetry plane and embedded 0.9 mm beneath the catalyst sur-
faces by eroding 1.2 mm diameter and 8.1 mm long holes from the
outer  Si[SiC]  sides.  For  kinetic  studies  it  is  essential  to  vary  the
catalyst surface temperatures so as to control the catalytic reactiv-
ity and, when desired, the onset of homogeneous ignition. To this
direction, surface temperatures are regulated by a combined cool-
ing/heating arrangement. The front facets of the ceramic plates are
contacted to a water-cooled support metal frame and an even finer
cooling  is  achieved  by  two  room-temperature  air  jets  impinging
on the outer side of the ceramic Si[SiC] plates, while two resis-
tive coils with adjustable power positioned above the rear part of
the outer ceramic plates provide external heating ( Fig. 6 (b)).

Optical accessibility is maintained from both reactor sides via
two  35-mm-thick  quartz  windows  on  the  high-pressure  tank,
while streamwise optical access is also available through the rear
tank flange. In situ, non-intrusive, laser-based spectroscopic tech-
niques are applied, shown in their latest arrangement [41,76,77] in
Fig. 6 (a). 1-D spontaneous Raman measurements of major gaseous
species  concentrations  and  temperature  across  the  7-mm  chan-
nel  height  are  acquired  using  a  pulsed  Nd:  YLF  laser  (526.5 nm,
120 ns pulse duration, 2 KHz repetition rate, pulse energy 43 mJ)
and an imaging spectrograph; typical Raman signals recorded on
the imaging spectrograph are shown in Fig. 6 (c) pertaining to cat-
alytic combustion of methane. The 7 mm height is recorded on 220
pixels, which are subsequently binned to 60 pixels. Effective Ra-
man cross-sections, which include transmission efficiencies (win-
dows, lenses, spectrometer, filters and camera), are evaluated by
recording the signals of several pressurized containing mixtures of
known composition, while the temperature/species solution is ob-
tained iteratively [19] . Kinetic studies are performed at laminar and
steady  flow  conditions,  such  that  scattered  light  from  ∼30 0,0 0 0
laser  pulses  is  integrated  on  the  detector  chip  to  increase  the
signal-to-noise ratio of the inherently weak Raman process [78,79] .
Data are acquired over the channel length x ≤ 120 mm by travers-
ing an optical table supporting the sending and collecting optics,
including the Nd: YLF laser ( Fig. 6 (a)). Measurement accuracy is
±5% for species volumetric contents ≥ 3% and ±10% accuracy for
contents down to 0.5%, while values less than 0.5% entail larger
inaccuracies. Raman data closer than ∼0.5-0.7 mm to both catalyst

surfaces are discarded due to low signal-to-noise ratios. The Raman
measurements are processed to yield the boundary layer concen-
trations of all major species, which are in turn used to assess the
local catalytic reactivity as will be elaborated in Section 2 . The Ra-
man technique has also been applied away from catalytic surfaces,
to monitor the exhaust composition in a Pt microtube [80] or the
composition in the wake of a Pt wire [81] .

PLIF of radicals (typically OH, CH

2 [17,46,82] ) is ap-
plied along the x - y symmetry plane of the reactor using a pulsed
Nd: YAG/dye laser system (10 ns pulse duration, 20 Hz repetition
rate,  pulse  energy  0.5-12  mJ  depending  on  the  probed  species)
and  a  dedicated  intensified  CCD  camera  ( Fig.  6 (a)).  PLIF  images
∼100 mm in length are recorded and the camera is traversed ax-
ially  to  map  the  entire  300 mm  reactor  length.  Channel  areas
100 × 7 mm 2 are recorded on 1360 × 70 pixels of the CCD chip. As

PLIF is a much stronger process than Raman, fluorescence signals
as close as 0.3 mm to the channel walls can be evaluated. Given the
steady operating conditions, ∼400 LIF images are averaged at each
measuring location to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. A typical
OH-PLIF flame image is illustrated in Fig. 6 (d). Absolute concen-
trations of the fluorescing species can be deduced via absorption
calibration measurements through the side optical windows [75] ;
however, quantitative LIF measurements are not truly necessary as
of  main  interest  for  assessing  gas-phase  reaction  mechanisms  is
the location of gaseous ignition (marked x
ig,g in Fig. 6 (c)) and the
ensuing flame shape. It is worth noting that while many intrin-
sic flame instabilities appear in wall-bounded flows [30,32,34,83] ,
they are largely suppressed by the catalyst [84,85] leading to stable
flames (such as the one shown in Fig. 6 (d)) over extended measur-
ing periods. Turbulent flows, which are of interest to many prac-
tical catalytic systems [11,86,87] can also be investigated by com-
bining the Raman/PLIF setup in Fig. 6 (a) with particle image ve-
locimetry (PIV) [50] . All in all, the reactor in Fig. 6 removes limita-
tions inherent in the conventional reactors of Fig. 5 . Because large
transverse  gradients  can  be  tolerated,  catalytic  reactivity  studies
can  be  performed  at  high  surface  temperatures  (up  to  1400 K
[19] ), without the need for excessively large GHSV. Furthermore,
the techniques can probe combined hetero-/homogeneous chemi-
cal processes, since Raman/PLIF allows for simultaneous monitor-
ing of the two reaction pathways. On the other hand, these bene-
fits come at a growing experimental complexity and higher numer-
ical  cost  since  multidimensional  CFD  codes  are  required  to  sim-
ulate  the  measurements.  The  specific  experimental  requirements
and the methodology for assessing catalytic and gas-phase reaction
schemes with this setup will be laid down in the coming section.
Spatially-resolved  measurements  have  also  been  reported  in
catalytic  stagnation-flow  reactors  (SFRs)  [88–92] .  Although  early
experiments in SFRs mainly assessed global parameters (catalytic
ignition and extinction, steady fuel conversion, product selectivity),
spatially-resolved  measurements  along  the  flow  symmetry  axis
above the catalytic surface have followed suit. Non-intrusive mea-
surements with Raman spectroscopy have only been reported in
[93] for the purpose of evaluating various catalytic reaction mech-
anisms during CPO of CH
4 over Rh (see Fig. 7 (a)). However, most
spatially-resolved  measurements  of  major  stable  species  in  cat-
alytic  SFRs  involve  microprobe  sampling  [88–90,94] ,  such  as  the
2  mole  fraction  profiles  in  Fig.  7 (b)  obtained  during  total  ox-
CO
idation  of  CH
4  over  Pd-substituted  hexaluminates.  Transversely-
resolved  microprobe  measurements  similar  to  those  in  Fig.  7 (b)
have also been applied to external boundary layer flows over cat-
alytic surfaces [95–97] . In addition to stable species, radical species
have been measured in SFRs using LIF [98–100] . Quantitative LIF
measurements of OH and NO radicals above Pt-coated SFR surfaces
exposed to the flow of hot combustion products are shown in Fig.
7 (c, d) [98,99] .

SFR  modeling  with  large  chemical  reaction  mechanisms  is
nowadays straightforward using established 1-D numerical codes
[104,105] ,  whereas  more  demanding  2-D  codes  are  necessary  in
the channel of Fig. 6 . Nonetheless, the 2-D channel configuration
allows for studying certain processes such as homogeneous igni-
tion at steady operating conditions since the streamwise coordi-
nate  mimics  a  time  axis.  In  contrast,  heterogeneous  and  homo-
geneous ignition in stagnation flows are typically abrupt transient
events.

of non-intrusive laser diagnostic techniques as applied to species
and temperature measurements in gaseous combustion have been
reported  in  [79,113–117] .  Laser-based  surface  science  techniques
have also been reviewed in [118–121] , however, they are outside
the scope of the present work which focuses on gas-phase ther-
moscalar measurements. Such studies can provide, among other is-
sues, valuable information on the catalyst oxidation states during
light-off [122] .

Ju and Maruta [25] and Maruta [31] reviewed the fundamentals
and  technology  development  in  microscale  combustion,  focusing
mainly on gaseous combustion systems, heat recirculation effects,
flame instabilities and flame/wall interactions. Combustion stability
of catalytic microreactors has also been addressed in [25] . Kaisare
and Vlachos [28] reviewed microreactors discussing in more de-
tail catalytic and catalytic-homogeneous systems, while automotive
catalytic exhaust gas aftertreatment systems have been reviewed in
[42] .  The  coupling  of  transport  and  hetero-/homogeneous  chem-
istry  was  studied  in  Mantzaras  [107]  and  specifically  for  hydro-
gen  in  [108] .  Fischer-Tropsch  catalytic  technologies  for  synthesis
have been reviewed in [109] and the direct catalytic conversion of
methane to fuels and chemicals in [106] .

Advances  in  the  modeling  of  heterogeneous  and  hetero-
/homogeneous reactions have been reported in [110,111] and also

176

J. Mantzaras / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 169–211

in  a  special  edited  book  [112] .  In  terms  of  non-intrusive  laser-
based measurements, while the recent progress has been exten-
sively  reviewed,  few  studies  have  addressed  near-wall  measure-
ments [79] with no dedicated review on gas-phase measurements
above reactive (catalytic) surfaces. Aim of the present review is to
demonstrate the capabilities of recent (mostly within the last 15
years) non-intrusive laser-based measurement of gas-phase ther-
moscalars  but  mainly  not  from  the  side  of  laser  technology  de-
velopment.  Goal  is  to  review  the  methodologies  on  how  gas-
phase measurements over catalytic surfaces can facilitate the un-
derstanding  of  the  complex  interactions  between  heterogeneous
and  homogeneous  chemistry  and  between  hetero-/homogeneous
chemistry  and  transport.  To  unravel  such  intricate  interactions,
interpretation  of  the  measurements  with  accompanying  theory
or  numerical  modeling  is  essential.  Hence,  throughout  this  re-
view measurements are presented together with state of the art
multidimensional  CFD  simulations.  Progress  in  simulation  tools
will  be  outlined  and  the  specific  needs  for  further  development
will be identified. At the end, future directions for the application
of new laser-based techniques and their combination with surface
science  measurements  will  be  presented.  The  provided  material
is relevant for many catalytic systems and catalyst-fluid interfaces
but the focus is mainly on power generation, fuel-processing and
exhaust gas aftertreatment.

2. Requirements for the in-situ measuring techniques

When  assessing  the  catalytic  and  gas-phase  reactivities  with
spatially-resolved Raman and PLIF measurements, certain require-
ments must be fulfilled, which have been deduced with theoretical
analyses. Analytical solutions based on matched activation energy
asymptotics have identified the key parameters controlling the on-
set of catalytic and gas-phase ignition (Mantzaras et al. [7,123,124] ).
The catalytic and gas-phase ignition of a fuel-lean premixed com-
bustible  gas  is  studied  in  a  developing  laminar  flow  in  a  plane
channel with a height of 2 b ( Fig. 4 ). Without loss of generality, the
channel walls are maintained at a constant temperature T w (in the
same fashion, the channel walls in the reactor of Fig. 6 are primar-
ily controlled by the external heating/cooling systems). The model
assumptions  are  outlined  and  key  results  are  presented  without
derivation details.

A  single-step irreversible Arrhenius  reaction is  considered for
both the catalytic and gaseous reaction pathways with fuel being
the deficient reactant:
[ F ] + νO [ O ] → νP [ P ] .

(2)

A catalytic reaction first-order with respect to the fuel and zero-
order with respect to the oxidizer is considered, in accordance to
the total oxidation of alkanes on noble metals [19,77,125,126] . The
catalytic molar reaction rate of the fuel,   ̇ s F , is hence:

invoked. The following non-dimensional streamwise and transverse

A closed-formed parametric solution for the gas-phase chemi-
cally frozen state (pure catalytic combustion) yields the catalytic
conversion  of  the  deficient  reactant  as  well  as  catalytic  ignition
criteria. The weakly gas-phase reactive state is subsequently for-
mulated and, finally, via asymptotic matching, criticality conditions
for the onset of homogeneous ignition are determined [7] .

thus avoiding the complication of technical catalysts. The local cat-
alytic  rate   ̇ s
F  in  Eq.  (9)  is  directly  linked  to  the  local  transverse
gradient of the fuel at the wall and to the local thermodynamic
( ρ)  and  transport  ( D
F )  properties.  Transport  properties  are  rela-
tively easy to model, while thermodynamic and reactive scalar pa-
rameters can be measured. The Raman technique should be able
to resolve the reactive species boundary layer profiles, such as the
ones shown in Fig. 9 . Measurements are typically needed for Da s
<
s,ig  since it is for this range of Damköhler numbers that the
∼ Da
normalized  wall  gradient  (1/ Y
F,w  (or  equivalently  the  cat-
alytic reaction rate   ̇ s
F ) changes appreciably with Da s  (see Fig. 8 ).
Attempts to carry out experiments at higher Da s not only strain the
Raman technique to resolve diminishing near-wall species concen-
trations but also offer no advantage in kinetic investigations since
the catalytic reaction rate changes very slowly for Da s > Da
s,ig (see
Fig. 8 ). It is fortunate that in the region of interest Da s  (cid:2) Da
s,ig
the deficient reactant mass fraction at the wall is still apprecia-
ble (see Fig. 8 and further Fig. 9 demarcating the range of interest
s,ig the
for measurements). Analytical solutions indicate that at Da
ratio (1/ Y
F,w ranges from 0.20 to 0.35. This is still an apprecia-
ble amount that can be resolved, at least with time-averaged Ra-
man measurements. Equally important to the advanced laser diag-
nostics is the measurement of surface temperatures with thermo-
couples (see Figs. 6 (a, b)). The wall temperature profiles are used
as boundary conditions in the simulations and further provide an
important input for the calibration of the Raman signals. On the
other hand, the transverse temperature profile in Fig. 9 indicates
an experimental complication as the low density gas near the hot
catalytic walls (wall temperatures up to 1400 K) reduces apprecia-
bly the Raman signals. Raman measurements within ∼0.5-0.7 mm
from the catalyst surfaces are discarded due to intense thermal ra-
diation background from the hot walls and optical vignetting that
both reduce the signal-to-noise ratios. The catalytic reaction rate is
not assessed directly from the wall-gradient of the deficient reac-
tant in Eq. (9) (gradients in general entail larger measuring errors)
but by comparing measured and predicted boundary layer species
profiles.

The  gas-phase  chemical  rate  is  B g [ C

E g = 167.5 kJ/mol  and  varying  B g  in  order  to  control  Da g ;  the
catalytic reactivity is similarly controlled by varying Da s . The com-
petition  between  the  catalytic  and  gaseous  pathways  is  evident
in  Fig.  10 .  For  a  given  Da s ,  the  homogeneous  ignition  distance
ζ
ig,g  obviously  decreases  with  increasing  gas-phase  reactivity
Da g .  On  the  other  hand,  for  a  given  Da g  a  rise  in  the  catalytic
reactivity (Da s ) inhibits homogeneous ignition by increasing ζ
ig,g ,
since  the  catalytic  pathway  converts  fuel  at  the  expense  of  the
gaseous  pathway.  There  exist  infinite  combinations  of  gaseous
and catalytic reactivities, Da g  and Da s , yielding exactly the same
homogeneous ignition distance, as illustrated by the homogeneous
ignition distance isolines in Fig. 10 . When a slow catalytic reaction
is coupled to a slow gaseous reaction, it can produce exactly the
same ζ
ig,g  to that of a faster catalytic reaction combined with a
faster gaseous reaction.

The requirements for assessing homogeneous ignition in a cat-
alytic channel are outlined. Homogeneous ignition has been inves-
tigated under infinitely-fast surface chemistry (Da s → ∞ ) [123] and

of constant ζ
ig,g in Fig. 10 , it is imperative to evaluate with Raman
measurements the catalytic processes over the gaseous induction
zone 0 < ζ < ζ
ig,g . In other words, the Raman measurements over
the gaseous induction zone remove any uncertainties of the cat-
alytic reaction pathway that can potentially falsify the gaseous ki-
netics. Conversely, when assessing the catalytic reactivity, measure-
ments  should  be  made  at  operating  conditions  where  gas-phase
combustion is not ignited or otherwise at locations well upstream
of ζ
ig,g to avoid falsification of catalytic kinetics by gaseous chem-
istry. Special care is needed at elevated pressures due to the poten-
tially significant contribution of gaseous chemical reactions even in
the absence of vigorous flames [19] .

The Raman signals in Fig. 6 (c) necessitate an accompanying 2-
D numerical code to compute the transverse species profiles. Two-
dimensionality is also cardinal for assessing gas-phase combustion,
as the location of homogeneous ignition ζ
ig,g strongly depends on
the boundary layer profiles of species and temperature shown in
Fig. 9 . This requirement is also evidenced in the analytical homo-
geneous ignition criterion of Eq. (16) as the gaseous chemical time
τ
ch,g in Eq. (13) explicitly accounts for the near-wall reactant de-
pletion. 2-D boundary layer (parabolic) codes are popular due to
their computationally efficient axially-marching solution [128] . The
applicability of the boundary layer approximation in pure catalytic
combustion has been examined by comparing boundary layer (BL)
and  Navier  Stokes  (NS)  2-D  predictions  in  [129] .  For  the  entry
channel-flow in Fig. 4 , the BL approximation is adequate even for
inlet  Reynolds  numbers  as  low  as  20  [129]  such  that  catalytic
chemistry can be in most cases accurately simulated with parabolic
codes. On the other hand, homogeneous ignition poses more se-
vere  restrictions  since  the  axial  gradients  across  the  flame  and
the rise of appreciable transverse velocities due to the volumetric
gaseous heat release can invalidate the BL approximation. Compar-
isons between NS and BL predictions have assessed the applica-
bility of the BL model in hetero-/homogeneous combustion [124] .
Fig. 11 provides such comparisons for CH
4 /air catalytic combustion
over Pt, using detailed catalytic [101] and gas-phase [130] reaction
mechanisms. NS simulations always yield shorter ignition distances
due to the contribution of upstream diffusion. As the inlet velocity

with sufficiently high equivalence ratio and/or low flow velocities
invalidate the BL approximation. Elevated pressures, in particular,
favor the BL approximation ( Fig. 11 (c)) due to the negative pres-
sure dependence of hydrocarbon laminar flame speeds. Nonethe-
less, hetero-/homogeneous combustion simulations require a care-
ful model selection.

3. Raman and OH-PLIF in methane total oxidation on Pt, Rh
and Pd

2 O

The  methodology  for  assessing  the  catalytic  and  gas-phase
reactivities  with  Raman  and  OH-PLIF  is  demonstrated  using  as
paradigm  the  total  oxidation  of  methane  over  polycrystalline  Pt,
Rh  and  Pd  catalysts.  The  inner  Si[SiC]  surfaces  of  the  channel
in  Fig.  6  are  coated  using  the  same  plasma  vapor  deposition
(PVD) approach for the three catalysts. First a 1.5-μm thick non-
porous Al
3 layer is deposited followed by a 2.2-μm thick noble
metal  layer  (Pt,  Rh  or  Pd).  The  substantially  thick  2.2  μm  noble
metal layer closely resembles a polycrystalline Pt surface. This has
been confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) sur-
face analysis, with active and total surface area measurements by
means of CO-chemisorption and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller ( BET) Kr-
physisorption, and finally by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
[19,131] . For the following kinetic studies, laminar flow conditions
are used in the experiments. Simulations are carried out with a 2-
D Navier Stokes code [45,132] , whereby surface and gaseous reac-
tion rates are evaluated using the Chemkin package [133,134] and
transport is modeled with a mixture-average approach [135] .

3.1. Heterogeneous reactivity of fuel-lean CH 4 /air mixtures on Pt

Fuel-lean combustion of CH

4 /air mixtures over polycrystalline
Pt  is  investigated  in  [19,47,136,137] .  Catalytic  kinetic  studies  are
carried  out  at  pressures  4 bar ≤ p ≤ 16 bar,  with  surface  temper-
atures  maintained  below  1200 K  in  order  to  mitigate  homoge-
neous  ignition.  Raman-measured  and  predicted  (using  the  de-
tailed mechanism from Deutschmann et al. [138] ) transverse pro-
files  of  methane,  water  and  temperature  are  plotted  in  Fig.  12
for four different pressures and three selected positions per case.
The profiles have a modest asymmetry due to small temperature
differences  between  the  upper  and  lower  catalytic  plates  (up  to
45 K,  Fig.  13 ).  The  asymmetry  is  fully  accounted  for  by  the  nu-
merical  model  and  it  is  actually  desirable,  as  it  allows  evalua-
tion  of  surface  kinetics  at  two  different  wall  temperatures  for  a

given  axial  position.  Methane  mole  fractions  range  from  1.5%  to
4%  over  the  interrogated  transverse  extent  of  the  measurements
(0.6 mm (cid:2) y (cid:2) 6.4 mm). Methane conversion occurs in the mixed
transport/controlled regime, according to the requirements set in
Section 2.1 , thus allowing for assessment of the catalytic reactivity.
Although Raman measurements within ∼0.6 mm from both walls
are precluded, the comparisons of measured and predicted bound-
ary layer profiles over the remaining channel height suffice to as-
sess the aptness of a catalytic mechanism (see e.g. the shaded area
in  Fig.  9  and  the  appreciably  different  transverse  profiles  when
Da s < Da
s,ig ).  The  catalytic  reactivity  in  Fig.  12  is  slightly  over-
predicted, as manifested by the computed near-wall steeper drop
2 O) mole fraction compared to that observed
(rise) in the CH
in the measurements. The overall good agreement between mea-
surements and predictions in Fig. 12 is only germane to the em-
ployed catalytic reaction mechanism [138] and is not reproduced
(at least at elevated pressures) by other catalytic schemes [19] . As
the atmospheric pressure performance of the catalytic mechanism
has been established in [101,138] , the applicability of the employed
catalytic scheme is thus ascertained over the entire pressure range
1 bar ≤ p ≤ 16 bar, which is of interest for the practical combustion
systems discussed in Section 1.1 .

4  (H

When  assessing  the  catalytic  reactivity,  the  conditions  in
Fig. 12 are selected to avoid homogeneous ignition and vigorous
flame formation and this has been verified by the accompanying
OH-PLIF  experiments.  However,  even  in  the  absence  of  vigorous
gaseous combustion, gas-phase chemistry cannot altogether be ne-
glected especially at elevated pressures. The reactor extent is delin-
eated over which the contribution of gaseous chemistry is minimal.
Computed streamwise profiles of the catalytic ( C ) and gaseous ( G )
methane conversions using the catalytic and gas-phase schemes of
Deutschmann et al. [138] and Warnatz et al. [139] , respectively, are
shown in Fig. 14 for two cases in Fig. 12 . The validity of the em-
ployed Warnatz gaseous reaction mechanism at elevated pressures
will be established in the next section. In Fig. 14 the volumetric
gaseous methane conversion rates are integrated across the 7 mm
channel height to facilitate comparisons with the catalytic surface
rates; the latter account for the contribution of both catalytic sur-
faces. The onset of appreciable gas-phase contribution in Fig. 14 ,
defined as the axial location where the gaseous methane conver-
sion amounts to 5% of the catalytic conversion, occurs at x a, g = 101
and 93 mm for Cases 1 and 4, respectively. When x < x a,g the nu-
merical  predictions  are  unaffected  by  the  inclusion  of  gas-phase
chemistry, such that catalytic reactivity studies in Fig. 12 are only
performed over this axial extent. It is noted that the onset of ap-
preciable  gas-phase  methane  conversion  does  not  correspond  to
the onset of homogeneous ignition.

Fig.  15.  Heterogeneous  and  homogeneous  reaction  flux  analysis  for  Case  4  in
Fig. 12 at x = 119 mm (adapted from [19] ).

The  coupling  between  the  heterogeneous  and  homogeneous
pathways  is  studied  with  the  reaction  flux  analysis  in  Fig.  15 ,
pertaining to x = 119 mm for Case 4. Gaseous methane conversion
amounts to 34% of the catalytic conversion at this axial position, as
evidenced in the conversion plots of Fig. 14 (b). The gaseous path-
way converts CH
4  predominantly to CO but most of the formed
CO adsorbs on the catalyst due to its high sticking coefficient on
2  in  the  gas  phase
Pt  and  only  a  small  part  of  it  oxidizes  to  CO
( Fig. 15 ). The adsorbed CO is further catalytically oxidized to CO
2 (s)
2 (s) produced via the main methane
which, together with the CO
catalytic  oxidation  route,  desorbs  as  gaseous  CO
2 .  As  gas-phase
combustion of hydrocarbons is generally described by a two-step
process [140] , first conversion to CO and then the main exothermic
oxidation of CO to CO
2 , it is evident that the catalytic pathway in-
hibits homogeneous ignition by depriving CO from the gas phase.
Still, even in the absence of homogeneous ignition and vigorous
flame formation, gaseous chemistry can contribute significantly to
4 → CO  oxidation
the  methane  conversion  via  the  incomplete  CH
route.  The  hetero-/homogeneous  chemistry  coupling  via  the  CO
route is particularly important at elevated pressures [19] and com-
plicates the assessment of the catalytic reactivity since at fuel-lean
stoichiometries  CO  is  a  minor  species  in  the  induction  zone  of
CH
4 /air flames [141] and cannot be easily assessed by spontaneous
Raman. The species boundary layer profiles will be appreciably af-
fected by gaseous chemistry at x > x a,g and an attempt to use Ra-
man data at such axial distances will falsify the catalytic kinetics.

The capacity of the catalytic reaction mechanism [138] to repro-
duce the transverse methane profiles and hence the local catalytic
reaction rate at pressures up to 16 bar deserves attention. The lim-
iting step in the catalytic reaction mechanism is the dissociative
adsorption of methane, which has an order 2.3 with respect to Pt:

alyst, leading to higher O(s) and lower Pt(s). To facilitate the dis-
cussion, the drop of θ

rate in Eq. (17) is the product of the positive [CH
concentration dependence and the negative p −n ( n = 2.3 α) surface
coverage dependence. The exponent n is less than unity, such that
the catalytic reactivity has an overall positive pressure dependence
p 1- n . The particular value of n is crucial as it restrains the rate of
increase  of  the  catalytic  reactivity  with  rising  pressure.  A  global
step for methane catalytic oxidation on Pt is considered:

where the factor ( p / p o ) −n accounts for the aforementioned pres-

[19] reproduce the Raman measurements and the simulations with
detailed catalytic chemistry with an accuracy of ± 20% over the en-
tire pressure range 1 bar ≤ p ≤ 16 bar: B = 1.27 × 10 5 cm/s, n = 0.53,
apparent activation energy E s = 84 kJ/mol and p o = 1 bar. For more
accurate predictions, a reduced catalytic reaction scheme has also
been constructed in [19] .

3.2. Homogeneous ignition of fuel-lean CH 4 /air mixtures on Pt

Gaseous  chemistry  is  assessed  in  another  set  of  experiments
with surface temperatures 1050 K ≤ T w ≤ 1430 K, values higher than
the foregoing catalytic kinetic studies in order to promote homo-
geneous ignition [46] . In the PLIF technique ( Fig. 6 ), radiation at
285.03 nm is used with an energy of 0.5 mJ per pulse, low enough
to  avoid  saturation  of  the  A( v = 1)  ←  X( v (cid:8) = 0)  transition  of  the
OH  radical.  Fluorescence  is  collected  from  both  (1-1)  and  (0-0)
transitions at 308 and 314 nm, respectively. Comparisons between
PLIF-measured and predicted 2-D distributions of the OH radical
are  illustrated  in  Fig.  16  for  four  cases  at  pressures  of  1,  4,  8

at p > 6 bar, while GRI-3.0 [142] and Leeds [143] substantially un-

resulting differences among the three gaseous mechanisms are up
to 100 ms. As power generation systems ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) have typi-
cal residence times shorter than 30 ms, it is evident that the proper
choice of a gaseous reaction mechanism will greatly impact reactor
design. The capacity of the gaseous reaction mechanisms to cap-
ture the homogeneous ignition distance ( x
ig,g ) is primarily related
to their aptness in reproducing ignition characteristics (ignition de-
lays), although propagation characteristics also play a role in estab-
lishing the flame anchoring point (see Fig. 11 ). On the other hand,
the post-ignition behavior of the gaseous chemical mechanisms re-
flects  their  capacity  to  capture  flame  propagation  (i.e.  the  flame
sweep angles).

Assessment  of  the  catalytic  processes  preceding  the  onset  of
homogeneous  ignition  is  still  necessary  for  the  proper  evalua-
tion of gaseous chemistry in Fig. 16 . Although the validity of the
Deutschmann et al. [138] mechanism has been established in the
foregoing section, the relatively high surface temperatures required
to achieve homogeneous ignition can potentially deactivate (par-
tially or totally) the catalyst, thus creating a near-wall fuel excess
that will in turn promote homogeneous ignition and hence falsify
the gas-phase kinetics. Comparisons between measured and pre-
dicted  (Deutschmann/Warnatz  reaction  schemes)  transverse  pro-

Raman measurements and predictions demonstrates that the cat-
alytic scheme realistically reproduces the heterogeneous processes
preceding homogeneous ignition.

Fig. 18 (3c, 4b) refer to axial positions just upstream of homo-
geneous  ignition  and  indicate  a  transport-limited  conversion  of
the  deficient  methane  reactant.  Fig.  18 (4c)  on  the  other  hand  is
located  well-downstream  of  homogeneous  ignition  and  demon-
strates  that  gas-phase  combustion  can  also  be  determined  with
the  Raman  measurements  (albeit  not  as  precisely  as  with  OH-
PLIF). The simulations in Fig. 18 (4c) refer to x = 93.5 mm (computed
ig, g = 66 mm) and indicate a near-wall gaseous combustion zone
x
where methane is almost fully depleted such that the catalytic re-
action rate vanishes (the transverse gradient of the methane mole
CH4 / dy ) w  ∼ 0). The same
fraction at the walls is nearly zero, ( dX
behavior is also attested in the Raman data, despite the inherent
noise of the measurements at vanishing methane levels near the
walls in Fig. 18 (4c). Pre-ignition ( x < x
ig,g ) gas-phase methane con-
version can be identified in the methane simulations of Fig. 18 (3c,
4b)  but  it  is  hard  to  confirm  it  with  the  Raman  measurements.
Although successive Raman measurements at closely-spaced axial
positions can also be used to assess gas-phase combustion, their
applicability  is  mostly  limited  to  positions  well-inside  the  com-
bustion zone ( x > x
ig,g ) and only for conditions of strong gaseous
combustion that depletes the deficient reactant over broad zones
near  the  walls.  Such  requirements  cannot  be  met  in  cases  of
diffusionally  imbalanced  mixtures  (fuel-lean  H
2 /air  combustion,
Section 4 ) or in the case of turbulent hetero-/homogeneous com-
bustion ( Section 8.1 ). In conclusion, PLIF provides by far the most
reliable technique for monitoring homogeneous ignition.

The origin of the differences between the three gaseous reac-
tion  schemes  is  investigated  by  comparing  ignition  delay  times
at  various  pressures,  temperatures  and  equivalence  ratios.  It  has
been shown [46] that the large homogeneous ignition differences
in Fig. 16 are primarily attributed to the intermediate temperatures
900 K ≤ T ≤ 1400 K and secondarily to the very lean stoichiometries
(equivalence ratios as low as φ = 0.05 at the location of homoge-
neous ignition due to the upstream catalytic depletion of methane)
that are both specific to catalytic combustion systems. Character-
istically,  for  temperatures  higher  than  1500 K  the  computed  ig-

nition  delay  times  with  the  Warnatz,  GRI-3.0  and  Leeds  mecha-
nism differ by less than 20% over the ranges 1 bar ≤ p ≤ 16 bar and
0.05 ≤ φ ≤ 0.50.

Since  the  Warnatz  et  al.  [139]  mechanism  is  suitable  at  p  >
6 bar  ( Fig. 16 ), it provides the platform for the construction of a
modified mechanism valid for 1 bar ≤ p ≤ 16 bar. Sensitivity analysis
has shown that homogeneous ignition at low pressures is partic-
ularly sensitive to the chain branching step CHO + M = CO + H + M,
while at p > 6 bar the corresponding sensitivity is weak. Using up-
dated kinetic data for this reaction [144] the scheme of Warnatz
et al. [139] has been modified [46] such that good agreement with
the OH-PLIF measurements is established over the entire pressure
range 1 bar ≤ p ≤ 16 bar (see Fig. 19 ).

3.3. Heterogeneous reactivity of fuel-lean CH 4 /O 2 /N 2 mixtures on Rh

Methane  total  oxidation  is  investigated  over  Rh  catalysts  at
pressures 2–12 bar and catalyst temperatures 700–1250 K [77] . The
catalytic  kinetic  studies  differ  from  the  previous  ones  over  Pt
( Section 3.1 ) in the following aspects. The higher catalytic reactiv-
ity of methane on Rh compared to Pt dictates wall temperatures ca.
150 K lower than those on Pt, since the criteria for catalytic reactiv-
ity evaluation ( Section 2.1 ) are satisfied at lower surface Damköh-
ler numbers Da s . Further, contrary to Pt where a literature catalytic
mechanism  is  shown  valid  over  the  entire  investigated  pressure
range, no such mechanism exists for Rh.

Comparisons between measured and simulated (using the de-
tailed kinetic scheme from Karakaya et al. [145] , which has been
validated only at atmospheric pressure) transverse profiles of the
deficient methane reactant are shown in Fig. 20 at four axial po-
sitions. The corresponding wall temperature profiles are given in
Fig. 21 . Computed transport-limited solutions for the last axial lo-
cations are also plotted in Fig. 20 (marked TL) and provide phys-
ical lower bounds for the methane mole fractions. For the lowest
pressure of 2 bar in Fig. 20 (a1), the employed catalytic mechanism
[145] reproduces the measured methane boundary layer profiles at
all axial positions and this is evident despite the lack of Raman
data within ∼0.6 mm from both catalytic walls. At 5 bar deviations
between measurements and predictions become visible, as seen at
the last two axial locations in Fig. 20 (a2) where the catalytic reac-
tivity is overpredicted. The overprediction of catalytic reactivity at
the downstream axial locations is further accentuated at pressures
8–12 bar. This is seen in the last two axial locations in Fig. 20 (a3,
a4)  where  the  measured  methane  mole  fractions  (stars  and  up-
per triangles) are appreciably higher than the corresponding pre-
dictions. A correlation between measured and predicted methane
mole fractions is plotted in Fig. 20 (b), manifesting a progressively
increasing discrepancy with rising pressure.

bol notation as in Figs. 20 (a1, a4). (b) Deviation between measurements and pre-
dictions at various pressures.

The earlier methane oxidation over Pt has shown that the high-
pressure  aptness  of  a  catalytic  reaction  mechanism  crucially  re-
lies on its capacity to capture the reduction in free-site coverage
(and the accompanying increase in oxygen coverage) with increas-
ing pressure. This in turn restrains the rate of increase of the cat-
alytic  reactivity  with  rising  pressure.  For  rhodium,  a  global  step
according  to  Eq.  (18)  is  also  developed,  with  the  following  fit-
ted kinetic parameters: B s = 1.6 × 10 5 cm/s,  E s = 85 kJ/mol, n = 0.70
and p o = 2 bar. Predictions with this step reproduce well the mea-
surements  over  the  entire  range  2 bar ≤ p ≤ 12 bar,  as  shown  in
Fig. 22 (a) and the correlation between measurements and predic-
tions  in  Fig.  22 (b).  The  methane  reactivity  on  Rh  has  an  overall
pressure dependence 1- n = 0.30, which is weaker than that of plat-
inum ( = 0.47). The specific exponent reflects the ratio of the net
adsorption rates of methane and oxygen on the particular noble
metal.

3.4. Homogeneous ignition of fuel-lean CH 4 /air mixtures on Rh

As the higher catalytic reactivity of methane on Rh allows for
catalytic kinetic studies at lower wall temperatures compared to
Pt, gas-phase ignition can also be studied at lower temperatures.
Comparisons  between  PLIF-measured  and  predicted  OH  distribu-
tions are shown in Fig. 23 for three cases (Case 3 is the same as
in Fig. 20 (a3)), while the corresponding wall temperature profiles
are included in Fig. 21 . The lower wall temperatures compered to
Pt have necessitated a faster gas-phase chemical reaction mecha-
nism to capture the onset of homogeneous ignition. While in the Pt
studies of Fig. 16 the Leeds [143] mechanism is too fast and under-
predicts the homogeneous ignition distances, it nonetheless pro-
vides good agreement to the PLIF measurements at the lower wall
temperatures in Rh (no homogeneous ignition is achieved with the
Warnatz [139] and GRI-3.0 [142] mechanisms). This behavior ex-
emplifies the need for intensified studies in low temperature and
low equivalence ratio hydrocarbon gas phase kinetics, which are
relevant the extreme operating conditions of catalytic systems.

In  Fig.  23  simulations  are  shown  with  the  detailed  catalytic
scheme  [145]  and  the  constructed  one-step  reaction,  except  for
Case 5 where simulations with only the detailed mechanism are

are shown: (5) p = 2 bar, φ = 0.38, U IN = 1.25 m/s, T IN = 461 K, (6) p = 12 bar, φ = 0.40,
U IN = 0.21 m/s, T IN = 440 K, (3) same as Case 3 in Fig. 20 (a3). Color-coded bars pro-

shown  (at  p = 2 bar  the  one-step  reaction  yields  essentially  the
same  x
ig,g  as  the  detailed  mechanism).  While  the  one-step  cat-
alytic  reaction  yields  reasonably  good  agreement  with  the  mea-
sured x
ig,g,  the detailed catalytic  mechanism provides fair agree-
ment only at 2 bar. At p = 8 and 12 bar the detailed catalytic mech-
ig,g , a result of its unrealistically
anism progressively overpredicts x
fast catalytic reactivity (shown in Fig. 20 (b)) that deprives methane
from the gaseous reaction pathway. This is also explained by the
dependence of the homogeneous ignition distance on the surface
Damköhler number Da s  in Fig. 10 . It is thus clear that the cou-
pling of catalytic and gaseous reaction pathways, which has been
elaborated in Section 2.2 , necessitates simultaneous evaluation of
gas-phase and catalytic kinetics.

3.5. Catalytic combustion of fuel-lean CH 4 /O 2 /N 2 mixtures on Pd

4 /O

2 /N

The combustion of fuel-lean CH

2 mixtures over PdO has
been studied at pressures 1–12 bar and surface temperatures 710–
1075 K [131] . Palladium is the most active noble metal catalyst for
the total oxidation of methane at temperatures up to 900 K [146] .
The active phase is PdO, which decomposes to relatively inactive
metallic Pd above ∼1070 K (at atmospheric pressure) followed by
re-oxidation of Pd to PdO below ∼870 K, thus creating a hystere-
sis in the methane conversion during heating and cooling cycles
[147] . An increase in oxygen partial pressure increases the PdO de-
composition temperature [148] . For the herein investigated oxygen
partial pressures [131] , the wall temperatures are always below the
PdO decomposition temperatures.

4  and  H

Comparisons  between  Raman-measured  and  predicted  trans-
verse  profiles  of  CH
2 O  mole  fractions  are  presented  in
Fig. 24 while the wall temperature profiles are shown in Fig. 25 .
The  simulations  in  Fig.  24  are  carried  out  with  an  optimized
one-step reaction, similar to Eq. (18) . The kinetic parameters are
B s = 1.7 × 10 4 cm/s, E s = 58 kJ/mol and p o = 1 bar. However, contrary
to  Pt  and  Rh  where  a  nearly  constant  exponent  n  could  be  de-
termined  in  Eq.  (18) ,  PdO  necessitates  a  pressure-dependent  ex-
ponent n to reproduce the Raman measurements. The exponents
n at various pressures are reported in Fig. 26 . Further, the reactiv-
ity of methane on the three noble metals presented in Section 3 is
compared using the derived global reaction steps.

The reactivity of methane in Fig. 26 increases in the order Pt,
Rh and PdO, as also reported in earlier atmospheric pressure stud-
ies  [146] .  Interestingly,  peculiar  non-monotonic  pressure  depen-
dence is observed for PdO: the reaction rate parameter increases

from  1  to  ∼3 bar  and  then  drops  at  higher  pressures.  Very  re-
cently [149] first-principle (density functional theory, DFT) simula-
tions along with microkinetic modeling have also revealed a non-
monotonic dependence of the intrinsic methane catalytic reactivity
on PdO at 1-10 bar, qualitatively similar to that shown in Fig. 26 .
Further measurements at fine pressure intervals between 1-5 bar
are required to identify the pressure with maximum reactivity and
its potential dependence on composition, temperature and exhaust
gas dilution (H
2 ). This is important for the abatement of
methane emissions in natural-gas-driven vehicles using PdO cata-
lysts positioned upstream of the turbocharger (operating pressures
∼1.5 bar).

2 O and CO

The decomposition of PdO above a pressure-dependent temper-
ature leads to a self-regulation of the catalyst temperature [12] that
in turn impacts homogeneous ignition. The OH-PLIF measurements
indicate  no  homogeneous  ignition  for  all  investigated  cases,  and
the same is attested in simulations with the three gaseous mech-
anisms  used  in  Section  3.2 .  Gas-phase  mechanisms  can  thus  be
tested  and  validated  against  PLIF  measurements  not  only  in  the

presence but also in the absence of homogeneous ignition. Addi-
tional simulations indicate [131] that gas-phase combustion can be
ignited at gas-turbine relevant pressures p > 10 bar but only at suf-
ficiently high mixture preheats ( T

IN ≥ 750 K).

In  a  similar  fashion  to  methane,  the  Raman/OH-LIF  method-
ology  has  been  applied  to  study  the  total  oxidation  of  ethane
[150]  and  propane  [151]  over  Pt,  assessing  the  pressure  depen-
dence of the catalytic reactivity and the conditions leading to ho-
mogeneous ignition.

3.6. Summary for the total oxidation of methane over noble metals

Key advantages of the non-intrusive measurements during fuel-
lean  methane  hetero-/homogeneous  combustion  over  Pt,  Rh  and
PdO are summarized. The ability to perform such measurements at
realistic compositions (i.e. practical equivalence ratios, without ex-
cessive dilution with an inert gas) and operating conditions (pres-
sure and temperature) has allowed for a detailed investigation the
chemical processes leading to the onset of homogeneous ignition
and exposed the underlying hetero-/homogeneous chemistry cou-
pling.  Since  methane  is  a  diffusionally  neutral  fuel  (Lewis  num-
CH4  ∼ 0.95),
ber of methane at fuel-lean stoichiometries in air Le
closed  flames  (V-shaped)  are  formed  extending  to  the  catalytic
channel center and this greatly facilitates the application of OH-
PLIF for assessing homogeneous ignition by mitigating the impact
of near-wall interferences. At the extreme operating conditions of
catalytic systems (very lean equivalence ratios and moderate tem-
peratures) a pressing need was demonstrated for improved high-
pressure  methane  gas-phase  reaction  mechanisms.  PLIF  provides
an  unparalleled  technique  for  accurately  assessing  homogeneous
ignition over catalytic surfaces, not matched by intrusive measure-
ment techniques.

Non-intrusive Raman measurements of major gaseous species
boundary  layer  profiles  have  also  allowed  for  assessing  the
methane catalytic reactivity at realistic operating conditions and,
in particular, for exposing the pressure dependence of the reactiv-
ity on various noble metals. Limitations in carrying out accurate
Raman measurements very close (within ∼0.5 mm) to the catalytic
surfaces are not as crucial, given the ability to assess the catalytic
reactivity by probing the full extent of the methane boundary layer
profiles (as discussed in Section 2.1 ). Nonetheless, one drawback
of the Raman measurements is the requirement for species volu-
metric compositions above ∼0.5%, which restricts the experimen-
tal assessment of hetero-/homogeneous chemistry coupling via CO
(see Fig. 15 ) occurring before the onset of homogeneous ignition.
To this direction, two-photon CO-PLIF may shed light to this pre-
homogenous ignition pathway coupling.

4. Hetero-/homogeneous combustion of diffusionally
imbalanced reactive mixtures

4 compared to O

Methane at lean stoichiometries is a nearly diffusionally neutral
reactant such that there is no appreciable preferential diffusion of
CH
2 or heat-to-mass preferential diffusion. Diffu-
sional imbalance leads to broader or narrower species boundary
layer profiles and to a positioning of the homogeneous combustion
zones either close to or far from the catalytic walls, processes that
have implications for the Raman/PLIF measurements. Examples are
provided below for hydrogen hetero-/homogeneous combustion at
fuel-lean stoichiometries (Lewis number of the deficient H
2 reac-
H2  ∼ 0.3)  and  fuel-rich  stoichiometries  (Lewis  number  of

4.1. Fuel-lean combustion of hydrogen on Pt

Hetero-/homogeneous combustion of fuel-lean H

2 /air mixtures
over  Pt  has  been  investigated  at  atmospheric  pressure  in  Appel
et  al.  [45]  and  extended  to  15 bar  in  Ghermay  et  al.  [20] ,  with
surface  temperatures  in  the  range  950 K ≤ T w ≤ 1220 K.  The  reac-
tor cooling arrangements in Fig. 6 are essential in suppressing the
superadiabatic surface temperatures that have would have other-
wise  been  attained  during  fuel-lean  H
2 /air  catalytic  combustion,
a  result  of  the  substantially  lower  than  unity  Lewis  number  of
hydrogen  [6,21,152] .  PLIF-measured  and  predicted  (using  the  de-
tailed catalytic reaction mechanism from Deutschmann [138] and
three early elementary gaseous mechanisms, Warnatz et al. [139] ,
Mueller et  al.  [153] and Miller and Bowman [154] ) distributions
of  the  OH  radical  for  a  case  at  p = 1 bar  are  provided  in  Fig.  27
along  with  the  measured  wall  temperature  (averaged  over  up-
per  and  lower  walls).  The  gas-phase  mechanism  from  Warnatz
et  al.  [139]  reproduces  the  PLIF-measured homogeneous  ignition
distance  x
ig,g  ( Fig.  27 (a2)),  while  the  other  mechanisms  lead  to
appreciably shorter ignition distances ( Fig. 27 (a3, a4)). These sub-
stantial differences mainly reflect [45] the impact of catalytically-
produced water, which is a very effective collision partner in the

2 + M and the associated
different  water  third  body  efficiencies  in  the  three  investigated
mechanisms. Further, as in the case of methane, the particular op-
erating conditions of catalytic systems (very lean equivalence ra-
tios) also play a role in the observed homogeneous ignition dis-
crepancies.

Raman measurements and computed transverse profiles of H
2
and H
2 O mole fractions for the case in Fig. 27 are shown in Fig.
28 (1a, 1b) at two axial locations upstream of the measured homo-
ig, g ≈ 91 mm. Transport-limited conver-
geneous ignition location x
sion of hydrogen is manifested in Fig. 27 (1a, 1b). Predictions with
the catalytic mechanism reproduce the measurements, albeit val-
idation of hydrogen catalytic kinetics cannot be performed under
transport-limited conditions. This is a result of the very high reac-
2 on Pt that necessitates excessive cooling of the reactor
tivity of H
plates in Fig. 6 (down to ∼400 K) to attain the surface Damköhler
numbers in the range 0 < Da s < Da
s,ig  required for kinetic studies
(see Section 2.1 ). The transport-limited hydrogen boundary layer
develops faster than the corresponding transport-limited methane
boundary layer (compare the profiles at the beginning of the chan-
nel  in  Figs.  28 (1a)  and  18 (3a))  and  this  property  facilitates  ki-
netic  studies  with  Raman  measurements  performed  at  upstream
axial positions. Further, the comparisons in Fig. 28 exemplify the
importance  of  simulations  in  interpreting  the  Raman  measure-
ments.  For  a  diffusionally  neutral  mixture  and  under  transport-
limited  catalytic  conversion  of  the  deficient  fuel,  the  mole  frac-
tion of the fuel at the channel mid-plane ( y = 3.5 mm) is linked to
the mole fraction of the products at the walls ( y = 0 or 7 mm) ac-
cording to the stoichiometric coefficients of the global reaction in
Eq. (2) . Hydrogen converts catalytically closely following the global
step  H
2 O  (production  of  intermediates  such  as  OH
do not appreciably disturb this global step after catalytic ignition
[45,155] ). In Fig. 28 (1a), however, the H
2 at the mid-plane and the
H
2 O at the walls in Fig. 28 (1a) do not follow the stoichiometric
1:1 molar ratio but a ratio of 1:2.4. This is a direct consequence
of  the  preferential  diffusion  of  hydrogen  which,  as  discussed  in
Section  1.2 ,  leads  to  a  surface  equivalence  ratio  2.4  times  larger
than the bulk gas equivalence ratio.

shapes in Fig. 29 is particularly good. While at atmospheric pres-
sure there have been significant differences in the performance of
earlier gas-phase mechanisms ( Fig. 27 ), over the last 10 years there
have been considerable advances in hydrogen kinetics at elevated
pressures  such  that  the  established  agreement  in  Fig.  29  is  also
obtained with other modern gas-phase hydrogen reaction mech-
anisms  [160–162] .  For  the  high-pressure  cases,  Raman  measure-
ments and simulations over the gaseous induction zones ( x < x
ig,g )
manifest  again  transport-limited  hydrogen  conversion  (see  Fig.
28 (4a, 4b)).

Inspection of Figs. 29 and 30 indicates that although at 2 and
8 bar the gaseous combustion is vigorous, it weakens at 12 bar and
finally becomes almost fully suppressed at 15 bar (see the G pro-
files  in  Fig.  30 (5)  and  the  corresponding  vanishing  OH  levels  in
Fig. 29 (5a, 5b)). To clarify this behavior, gas-phase ignition char-
acteristics (without the inclusion of catalytic reactions) are stud-
2 /air mixtures at
ied by computing ignition delays of fuel-lean H
pressures  1–15 bar  using  a  constant  pressure  non-catalytic  batch
reactor model [163] . Inverse ignition delays (quantities represen-
tative of the hydrogen gaseous reactivity) are plotted versus pres-
sure with parameter the initial temperature in Fig. 31 . The initial
temperatures in Fig. 31 range from 950 to 1200 K, values higher
than  the  mixture  preheats  in  Fig.  29  in  order  to  mimic  the  hot
catalytic walls that preheat the incoming reacting mixture. For the
channel reactor in Fig. 29 , the effective tem peratures in Fig. 31 are
a weighted average between the inlet and wall temperatures, with
an added weight on the latter. For the lowest initial temperature of
950 K, the gaseous reactivity at φ = 0.30 decreases rapidly with ris-
ing pressure up to ∼2 bar and then changes modestly for p ≥ 2 bar.
For the higher temperatures 10 0 0 K < T ≤ 1200 K, the reactivity ini-
tially increases monotonically with rising pressure, peaks at a criti-
cal pressure p cr , and then drops for p > p cr . With rising initial tem-
perature, p cr increases and the drop in reactivity for p > p cr is mod-
erated. This complex behavior in hydrogen gaseous chemistry is a
result of the competition between the chain branching step H + O

also of the chain branching sequence HO

For the high preheats T

IN  in the cases of Fig. 29 , the relevant
temperatures in Fig. 31 are 1100 K or higher. The implications for a
coupled hetero-/homogeneous combustion system is that the cat-
alytic pathway can favorably compete against the gaseous pathway
and  consume  substantial  amounts  of  hydrogen  during  the  elon-
gated gas-phase induction zones at p ≥ 12 bar, such that homoge-
neous ignition is inhibited. This indicates that homogeneous com-
bustion of fuel-lean hydrogen mixtures in gas-turbine hybrid con-
cepts ( Fig. 1 ) is largely suppressed. On the other hand, for modestly
IN  ∼ 310 K) gas-phase combustion is
preheated H
already suppressed at p ≥ 4 bar [157] , with the lower pressure limit
being  relevant  to  microturbine-based  portable  power  generation
systems ( Fig. 2 ). Hence, the aforementioned suppression of homo-
geneous combustion is a result not only of the intrinsic hydrogen
gas-phase  kinetics  but  also  of  the  competition  between  gaseous
and  catalytic  reaction  pathways  for  hydrogen  consumption.  It  is
emphasized that catalytic pathway is very efficient in converting
hydrogen due to its high reactivity on Pt (even at moderate sur-
face temperatures) and its large molecular diffusivity.

2 /air mixtures ( T

Contrary to the methane fuel in Figs. 16 and 23 where closed
flames  are  formed,  hydrogen  has  two  separate  flame  branches
( Figs. 27 and 29 ) extending parallel to the catalytic walls. This is
result of the diffusional imbalance of hydrogen: fuel is transported
more effectively towards the catalytic wall than heat away from
it, thus confining homogeneous combustion close to the channel
walls [22,45] . Implications of this flame configuration for the PLIF
measurements will be discussed in Section 4.3 .

2 /air  mixtures  are  tested  in  the  reactor  of
Fig. 6 at equivalence ratios φ = 2.5–6.5 and surface temperatures
760 K ≤ T w ≤ 1200 K. OH-PLIF cannot be applied to hydrogen flames
at elevated pressures and rich stoichiometries. OH concentrations
are up to three orders of magnitude lower than those at lean sto-
ichiometries with the same corresponding exothermicity [76] such
that the OH-PLIF signal is masked by quenching. Above 5 bar the
OH-PLIF signal falls below the detection limits and for this reason
2 PLIF is applied. Contrary to OH-PLIF, the predissociation of
hot-O
2 is fast such that quenching effects remain
the excited state of O
negligible at elevated pressures [76] . On the other hand, the hot-O
2
PLIF signal below ∼3 bar is too low for detection. Hence, OH-PLIF
is applied at pressures up to ∼5 bar and hot-O
2 PLIF at pressures
∼6–14 bar, while there can be an overlap of the two techniques in
the range ∼3–6 bar. For the hot-O

the full channel height. This flame behavior is similar to that ob-
served in fuel-lean methane ( Fig. 16 ) and fuel-lean low hydrocar-
bon hetero-/homogeneous combustion [150,151] .

Raman data and predictions indicate transport-limited conver-
sion of the deficient O
2  reactant at all investigated pressures, as
shown  in  Fig.  34  for  a  particular  case  at  9 bar.  Similar  to  the
previous  fuel-lean  studies,  transport-limited  operation  precludes
catalytic kinetic evaluation studies. Still, capturing the transport-
limited O
2  conversion by the catalytic mechanism is a prerequi-
site for validating the gaseous reaction mechanism in Fig. 32 . The
flames in Fig. 32 and the G profiles in Fig. 33 illustrate that, con-
trary to the fuel-lean studies in Figs. 29 and 30 , elevated pressures
do not suppress gaseous combustion. Inverse gaseous ignition de-
lays are compared in Fig. 31 for two stoichiometries ( φ = 0.3 and
φ = 6.9) that yield about the same adiabatic equilibrium tempera-
tures over the investigated pressure and initial temperature ranges.
For the highest temperatures 1150 K and 1200 K and for p ≤ 5 bar,
the φ = 0.3 mixture is more reactive, in agreement with H
2 gas-
phase ignition studies [166] that show considerably higher reactiv-
ity of lean over rich stoichiometries above the crossover temper-
ature ( ∼10 0 0 K at 1 bar and ∼1100 at 5 bar, temperatures where
the rates of H + O
2 + M become
equal). However, the reactivity at φ = 6.9 overtakes the correspond-
ing one at φ = 0.3 above a specific pressure that depends on tem-
perature. Therefore, at p > 8 bar and initial temperatures T > 1050 K
the fuel-rich stoichiometries are more reactive and this facilitates
flame establishment in Fig. 32 at pressures up to 14 bar. More im-
portant  factor  than  the  faster  intrinsic  gas-phase  kinetics,  how-
ever, is the inability of the catalytic pathway to compete effectively
with the gaseous pathway due to the low molecular diffusivity of
the deficient O
2 reactant. Thus, the coupling of kinetics and trans-
port during fuel-rich hydrogen hetero-/homogeneous combustion
allows for the formation of strong flames at both microreactor and
turbine-relevant pressures ( Figs. 1 and 2 ).

ergy  equation  since  the  measured  wall  temperature  profiles  are
imposed  as  accurate  interfacial  boundary  conditions  in  order  to

tion, having 1.2 mm height and 75 mm length [1,167] . The energy
equation is solved at the gas-wall interface along with heat con-
duction in the wall (solid thermal conductivity k s = 16 W/mK) and
surface radiation heat transfer. The hetero-/homogeneous reaction
mechanisms [138,159] , which have been validated in the forego-
ing kinetic studies, are employed. Results for H
2 /air mixtures with
φ = 0.3 and 4.0 are illustrated in Fig. 35 (a) and 35(b), respectively
[22,165] .

For the lean stoichiometry, two flame branches are formed as
also  seen  in  Fig.  29 .  This  particular  flame  configuration  clearly
demonstrates  the  advantages  of  PLIF  since  detection  of  gaseous
combustion  with  other  techniques  is  problematic.  For  example,
the intrusive microprobe in Fig. 5 (b) may have to touch the cat-
alytic walls to detect the thin flames in Fig. 35 (a2) or even the di-
minishing high-pressure flames in Fig. 29 (4a)), while conventional
chemiluminescence imaging suffers from strong interferences due
to the radiating hot surfaces just underneath the flames. Moreover,
the  presence  of  homogeneous  combustion  cannot  be  simply  in-
ferred by  monitoring  the  reactor  wall temperatures.  At  fuel-lean
stoichiometries  the  near-wall  gaseous  combustion  zones  moder-
ate  the  catalytically-induced  superadiabatic  surface  temperatures
( T w > T
ad ). This is because the gaseous reaction zones shield the
catalyst from the hydrogen-rich channel core [22,45] and dimin-
ish the catalytic conversion (compare the wall temperature profiles

w,1  and T
chemistry and only heterogeneous chemistry, respectively). Note,

( Fig. 35 (b2) and Fig. 32 ) and this arrangement may facilitate mea-
surements  with  other  techniques.  Although  the  intrusive  effects
of microprobes on flames anchored inside catalytic channels have
not been quantified, the flame configuration in Fig. 35 (b2) is more
amenable  to  a  traversable  microprobe  and  the  same  holds  for
chemiluminescence  imaging.  Furthermore,  the  popular  measure-
ment  of  wall  temperatures  may  give  a  rough  indication  for  the
existence  of  gaseous  combustion.  While  pure  catalytic  combus-
tion  of  diffusionally  imbalanced  deficient  reactants  with  Le > 1
w,2  profile
leads  to  underadiabatic  surface  temperatures  (see  T
in  Fig.  35 (b1)),  hetero-/homogeneous  combustion  induces  much
higher  wall  temperatures  which  are  nonetheless  limited  by  the
adiabatic equilibrium temperature (see T
w,1  in Fig. 35 (b1)). Inter-
estingly, the underadiabaticity in the surface is accompanied by a
superadiabaticity in the gas phase [152] , as shown by the gas tem-
perature at the channel mid-plane ( T gas,c in Fig. 35 (b1)).

In situ Raman measurements of gaseous species inside catalytic
channels with millimeter-size gaps similar to Fig. 35 have not been
reported. They are common in kinetic studies of liquids [168–171] ,
however, in such applications there is usually no transverse spatial
resolution. In any case, fundamental hetero-/homogeneous kinetic
studies  do  not  require  industrial  channel  geometries.  The  7 mm
channel height in Fig. 6 allows for sufficiently broad species bound-
ary  layers  that  can  be  adequately  resolved  by  the  Raman  tech-
nique. If needed, reactant conversion in the reactor of Fig. 6 and

impact the non-intrusive measurements. For fuel-lean stoichiome-
tries of hydrogen, gaseous combustion is confined in narrow zones
along the catalytic walls and this poses certain limitations in ap-
plying OH-PLIF, especially at elevated pressures whereby gaseous
combustion is significantly weakened due to the intrinsic hydro-
gen ignition kinetics. Nonetheless, PLIF still provides the only vi-
able technique for assessing gaseous combustion over catalytic sur-
faces of deficient reactants with Le  << 1 as intrusive techniques
face even stronger limitations at such extreme flame geometrical
configurations. On the other hand, for diffusionally imbalanced de-
ficient reactants with Le >  1,  flames are formed near the chan-
nel core and away from the catalytic walls thus greatly facilitat-
ing  the  application  of  PLIF.  For  the  particular  case  of  hydrogen,
however, rich stoichiometries lead to a complication as OH-PLIF is
too weak above ∼5 bar and necessitate less conventional PLIF ap-
proaches (O

2 -PLIF).

The non-intrusive Raman measurements allow for assessing the
catalytic  equivalence  ratio  (and  its  deviation  from  the  bulk  gas-
phase  equivalence  ratio)  by  comparing  the  near  wall  concentra-
tions of major reactants and products. For the particular case of
hydrogen, however, the very high reactivity of this fuel on noble
metals (at either lean or rich stoichiometries) does not allow for
assessing the catalytic reactivity since the conversion of the defi-
cient reactant is typically transport-limited. Given the appreciable
channel heights needed for the application of laser-based measure-
ments, very high velocities (leading to high Reynolds numbers and
hence to strongly turbulent flows) are necessary to alleviate trans-
port limitations. This would, however, complicate the evaluation of

5. Hetero-/homogeneous combustion of two fuels

Application of the Raman/PLIF techniques was demonstrated for
single fuels of Sections 3 and 4 and is herein extended to two fuel
components. Mixtures of CO and H
2 (syngas) under fuel-lean and
fuel-rich stoichiometries have been studied in the test rig of Fig. 6 .
In binary fuels, one component may either promote or inhibit the
catalytic ignition of the other. Moreover, under rich stoichiometries
it is still possible to perform catalytic kinetic studies even when
the conversion of the deficient oxygen reactant is transport limited.

tion) in hybrid large power generation systems ( Fig. 1 ) at turbine

of H

2 is determined by calculating, at the
motion of CO oxidation by H
upper wall, the ratio of the CO transverse wall gradient computed
with full H
2 /CO chemistry to that computed with only CO chem-
istry.  The  transition  temperature  for  inhibition  is  defined  at  the
particular axial location where this ratio shifts from below unity
to above unity. It is evident that the transition temperature corre-
sponds to the light-off temperature of H
2 oxidation, indicating that
the H
2 impact on CO oxidation is directly linked to the oxidation
state of hydrogen. The transition temperatures predominantly de-
pend on the equivalence ratio and much less on the H
2 :CO ratio
[173] .

The processes controlling the H

2 inhibition on CO oxidation are
identified by examining the reaction flux diagram at the upper wall
in Fig. 38 pertaining to x = 41 mm (upstream of the transition po-
sition x ∼ 50 mm). Three main factors are responsible for the ob-
2  [173] . First, under surface oxygen-limited
served inhibition of H
conditions (despite of its excess in the gas-phase, oxygen is a de-
ficient surface species due to its slower adsorption rate compared
to CO and H
2 and other species for adsorp-
tion sites. Secondly, the surface oxidation of adsorbed H(s) deprives
O(s) that is needed for the CO(s) oxidation (the O(s) is attacked
by  H(s)  via  two  parallel  reaction  sequences:  S9  followed  by  S11
or combination of S12 and S11, Fig. 38 ). Finally, the contribution
of the HCOO(s) reaction pathway (reactions S16-S21 in Fig. 38 ) is
appreciable in CO oxidation, and these reactions consume oxygen-
containing species (O(s) and OH(s)).

It  is  emphasized  that  the  spatially  resolved  CO  and  H

centrations  and  the  local  surface  temperature  measurements  in
Fig. 37 allow for investigating the H
2 /CO interactions with an ac-
curacy not easily attained in typical microflow reactors ( Fig. 5 (a)).
Therein,  nearly  isothermal  operation  is  required  with  uniform
transverse species concentrations. However, for the very reactive
hydrogen  it  is  challenging  to  eradicate  transport  limitations  and
ensure uniformity in the cross-flow direction.

close to the walls due to the low Lewis number of hydrogen, for

extend away from the wall and form a closed shape ( Fig. 39 (1a,

ther away from the wall, the resulting heat release increases the
channel core temperature and this in turn allows for gaseous H

combustion away from the wall. The effect of CO is illustrated in
Fig. 39 (1c), which is computed by removing the gaseous CO chem-
istry (i.e. treating CO as chemically inert species in gaseous chem-
istry –although its effect as third body in hydrogen chemical reac-

Two  different  simulations  are  included  in  Fig.  41 ,  with  the  cat-
alytic  mechanism  from  Zheng  et  al.  [172]  (solid  lines)  and  also
with  the  smaller  catalytic  mechanism  from  Deutschmann  et  al.
[138] (dashed lines) that lacks the HCOO(s) surface oxidation path-
way (see Fig. 38 ). While at high surface temperatures this omis-
sion is justified for fuel-lean stoichiometries [180] , for fuel-rich sto-
ichiometries the HCOO(s) pathway for CO(s) oxidation is equally
important to the direct oxidation pathway via O(s) [82] . The sim-
ulations with the smaller catalytic mechanism [138] are thus used
only to demonstrate some special features of the kinetic evaluation
process of fuel blends.

For the high wall temperatures needed to achieve homogeneous
ignition,  catalytic  conversion  of  the  deficient  oxygen  reactant  is
practically transport limited, as seen by the nearly zero levels of
the measured and predicted (using the Zheng et al. [172] mech-
anism) O
2  near both walls in Fig. 41 . Generally, under transport-
limited conversion of the deficient reactant the catalytic reactivity
cannot be assessed. However, kinetic evaluation is possible when
having multiple fuels at rich stoichiometries since the fuel com-
ponents compete for oxygen. In Fig. 41 , simulations with the larger
catalytic mechanism [172] (solid lines) capture the measured trans-
verse profiles of all major species. However, the smaller scheme
from [138] yields a minute CO conversion, which is evidenced by
2 (dashed lines). Interest-
the nearly uniform profiles of CO and CO
ingly, the vanishing CO conversion still leads to an O
2 conversion
close to the transport limit (dashed-line O
2 profile in Fig. 41 ), de-
spite the lean equivalence ratio of hydrogen ( φ
H2 = 0.68 based on
the  total  available  oxygen).  This  apparently  contradictory  behav-
ior is a result of the preferential diffusion of H
2 , which creates a
surface stoichiometry ∼2.4 times the bulk gas-phase stoichiome-
try, as discussed in Section 4.1 . Hence, for Raman measurements
at upstream locations where the gas at the mid-plane ( y = 3.5 mm)
has  about  the  same  composition  as  the  inlet,  the  H
2  surface
stoichiometry  is  fuel-rich  with φw, H2 ≈ 1.36,  such  that  the  limit-
ing  reactant  is  still  O
2 .  Comparisons  of  the  two  simulations  in
Fig. 41 clearly illustrate the capacity of the adopted methodology
to assess surface kinetic mechanisms of fuel blends even when the
deficient reactant undergoes transport limited conversion.

broad range of investigated equivalence ratios, H

ratios and pressures [82] , thus demonstrating the aptness of the
employed gas-phase reaction mechanism. It is worth demonstrat-
ing at this point the complementarity of the two PLIF techniques.

5.4. Summary for the combustion of two fuel components

Raman measurements allow for direct investigation of the cat-
alytic  chemistry  coupling  between  two  fuel  components,  for  ex-
ample of H
2  and CO ( Section 5.1 ). Measured boundary layer pro-
files  of  two  (or  more)  fuel  components  at  the  same  axial  posi-
ton, along with measurement of the surface temperature, provide
unprecedented details for studying the underlying catalytic chem-
ical  interactions  of  the  two  fuels.  The  advantage  of  the  Raman
measurements is exemplified in the case of multiple fuels, given
the capacity of the technique to simultaneously probe many major
species. A possible limitation arises from the range of accessible ra-
tios of fuel compositions, given the lower limit of ∼0.5% volumet-
ric content for the Raman technique. In this respect, interactions
of two fuels whereby one of them is in trace amounts cannot be
assessed.

As in the case of a single fuel, PLIF can assess the onset of ho-
mogeneous combustion and in conjunction with the Raman mea-
surements can expose the hetero-/homogenous chemical coupling
leading to the onset of homogeneous ignition.

2 O and partial oxidation products CO and H

In catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane the requirements
of the Raman technique are more stringent, as it must monitor not
only the local consumption of reactants but also the local forma-
tion of products from competing reaction pathways (total oxidation
products CO
2 ).
CPO of methane be accomplished autothermally and selectively in
millisecond-short contact times over Rh or Pt catalysts [183,184] ,
rendering the process attractive for on-board fuel reforming in mi-
croreactors  and  fuel-cells.  CPO  of  natural  gas  is  also  applied  in
large scale power generation within the catalytic-rich/gaseous-lean
hybrid combustion concept in Fig. 1 (b), although in this case the
optimization of syngas yields and selectivities is not of main con-
cern. On the other hand, key issue for fuel processing technolo-
gies is the methane conversion and product selectivity. The Raman
technique has been applied to investigate the CPO of CH

nearly  the  same  inlet  conditions  for  the  two  catalysts.  The  ax-
ial extent x ≤ 66 mm in Fig. 44 falls in the oxidation zone of the
channel  [65,185] ,  wherein  oxygen  is  not  fully  depleted  (see  also
Fig. 45 (1a)). Further, the transverse profiles are located upstream
of homogeneous ignition in order to avoid falsification of the cat-
alytic  processes  by  gaseous  chemistry.  Measured  wall  tempera-
tures  as  well as  the catalytic  ( C ) and  gaseous ( G ) methane con-
versions  for  the  conditions  in  Fig.  44  are  shown  in  Fig.  45 (1a,
1b). The catalytic conversion of the deficient O
2 reactant is nearly
transport  limited  for  both  catalysts  ( Fig.  44 (a2,  b2)).  Production
2  in  Rh  ( Fig.  44 (a3))  is  about  a  factor  of  ten  higher  com-
of  H
pared  to  Pt  ( Fig.  44 (b3)).  Hydrogen  production  in  Rh  is  some-

found for CO (CO
2 ) production (not shown in Fig. 44 ). The mod-
est overprediction of the partial over the total oxidation route in
Rh with the employed kinetic model [186] has also been reported
in [185] . Finally, the near-wall CH
4  mole fraction is lower in Rh
compared  to  Pt  ( Fig.  43 (a1,  b1)).  This  is  because  Rh  consumes,

while in Pt the gaseous ( G ) methane conversion rates are minimal
(see Fig. 45 (1b, 2b), where for clarity the G rates have been mul-
tiplied by factors of 15 and 40, respectively). The vigorous gaseous
combustion in Rh is further evidenced by the vanishing CH
2 O in
the post-flame zones of Fig. 46 (1(a),2(a), where gas-phase chem-
istry follows the sequence CH
2 according to the reac-
tion flux diagram in Fig. 15 . On the other hand, in Pt the methane
oxidation does not proceed past CH
2 O [41] . Rh promotes vigorous
flame formation despite its lower wall temperatures (up to 40 K
lower than Pt, see Fig. 45 ), which is a result of the preferred par-
tial  oxidation  route  in  this  catalyst.  Reason  for  the  vigorous  ho-
mogeneous combustion in Rh is that this catalyst produces much
higher amounts of H
2 , which is known to appreciably extend the
upper flammability limits (UFL) of methane [188] .

2 O → CO → CO

The  presence  of  a  vigorous  flame  in  Rh  drastically  affects
the CPO processes. Most importantly, it substantially reduces the
length of the oxidation zone: the X
O2 profile in Fig. 45 (1a) reveals
that O
2  is fully consumed at the end of the gaseous combustion
zone  x  ∼150 mm,  while  in  Fig.  45 (1b)  O
2  persists  down  to  the
channel  outlet  x = 300 mm  due  to  the  lack  of  vigorous  homoge-
neous combustion. Homogeneous combustion substantially reduces
the channel length required for O
2 consumption, since it has much
weaker transport limitations (dictated by the laminar mass burn-
ing rates) compared to those of the catalytic pathway. Characteris-
tically, it has been shown [189] that for fuel-lean H
2 /air combus-
2 conversion rate (kg/m 2 s) can be up to
tion over Pt the gaseous H
four times larger than the corresponding laminar catalytic H
2 con-
version rate. In practical systems, shortening of the oxidation zone
is beneficial as it allows for the subsequent steam reforming zone
(CH
2 ) to be initiated farther upstream and hence
to reduce the overall reactor length requirements. In addition, the
presence of flames does not affect the H
2  and CO selectivities at
the channel exit [41] since methane CPO is a process equilibrium-
limited and not kinetically-limited [65] . Finally, gaseous combus-

Hence, the common approach of monitoring the wall temperatures
in practical reactors does not warrant the assessment of vigorous
gaseous combustion. Further, typical exhaust gas analysis cannot
reveal whether gaseous combustion is present since, as mentioned
before, the CPO processes is not kinetic-limited but equilibrium-
limited. Further, 1-D axial probes ( Fig. 5 (b)) have not demonstrated
the capacity to monitor gaseous combustion. Hence, in situ laser-
based measurements provide a viable methodology for monitoring
the hetero-/homogeneous combustion processes during CPO and,
by validating chemical reaction mechanisms, for assessing the im-
pact of such processes in practical systems.

Detailed  parametric  numerical  studies  have  finally  delineated
the ranges of pressure and inlet temperature in the channel ge-
ometry of Fig. 47 , for which gas-phase combustion cannot be ne-
glected. The ratio of the integrated, over the full channel, gas-phase

tion  does  not  seem  to  deteriorate  the  low  propensity  of  Rh  for
coking as no carbon deposition is observed on the catalyst or the
exhaust section [41] , perhaps owning to the uptake by the catalyst
of coke precursor species.

Simulations  are  subsequently  performed  for  channel  geome-
tries typical to honeycomb methane CPO reactors used either in
power generation [167] or in fundamental laboratory-scale experi-
ments. In a similar fashion to Section 4.3 , a single channel is con-
sidered for methane CPO over Rh (tubular channel with diameter
1.2 mm and length 50 mm). The model solves for the interfacial en-
ergy equation, heat conduction in the wall (solid thermal conduc-

bution of gaseous chemistry, it is evident that for pressures above
8 bar and preheats above 500 K homogeneous combustion cannot
be ignored. It is very likely that many laboratory scale methane
CPO  experiments,  particularly  at  pressures  equal  or  greater  than
10 bar, have appreciable gas-phase chemistry contributions.

In summary, the capacity of the Raman technique to simultane-
ously probe multiple species allows (in conjunction with numerical
simulations) for assessing the reactant conversions and the prod-
uct (total oxidation and partial oxidation) yields and selectivities.
A  key  question  in  CPO  regarding  the  deficient  O
2  catalytic  con-
version  (kinetically-controlled,  transport-controlled,  or  mixed  ki-
netic/transport controlled) is unequivocally answered with the spa-
tially resolved Raman measurements. More important, however, is
the determination by means of CH
2 O-PLIF of homogeneous com-
bustion during CPO and its impact on the syngas yields and selec-
tivities.

7. Quantitative measurements using laser induced fluorescence

In the foregoing sections PLIF has been applied to determine
the  homogeneous  ignition  distance  x
ig,g  or  the  flame  position  x
f
and  such  geometrical  quantities  do  not  require  quantification  of
the LIF signals. Absolute concentrations of radical or stable species,
either  in  combined  hetero-/homogeneous  combustion  or  in  cat-
alytic combustion alone, are crucial for reaction mechanism devel-
opment and validation.

7.1. Flame-catalyst interactions investigated with LIF

The  hetero-/homogeneous  radical  coupling  over  the  extent  of
a  flame  or  over  the  post-flame  zone  requires  quantification  of
the  fluorescence  signals.  In  the  atmospheric  pressure  tests  of
Section 3.2 , OH-PLIF is calibrated with absorption measurements
carried  out  normal  to  the  side  quartz  windows  ( z -direction  in
Fig.  6 )  [75] .  However,  parameters  of  key  interest  such  as  trans-
verse  wall  gradients,  which  determine  the  uptake  of  OH  radi-
cals  on  the  catalyst,  have  not  been  determined.  Similarly,  OH-
PLIF  has  provided  relative  OH  concentrations  in  the  flame  and
post-flame  zones  of  a  CH
4 /air  flame  stabilized  at  the  entry  of
a  5 mm  high  catalytic  channel  coated  with  Pt  or  other  materi-
als  [191]  (see  Fig.  49 (a)).  While  the  OH  radical  distributions  in-
dicate  a  different  uptake  of  OH  for  Pt  ( Fig.  49 (a1))  and  quartz
( Fig.  49 (a2))  walls,  OH  fluxes  have  not  been  assessed.  For  the
point  LIF  measurements  discussed  in  Fig.  7 (c),  referring  to  hot
products  of  H
2  combustion  flowing  over  a  Pt  stagnation  sur-
face, the adsorptive OH flux has been quantified by computing the

tive fluxes J
OH  in Fig. 49 (b) are compared against predictions us-
ing detailed hetero-/homogeneous chemical reaction mechanisms
[101,192] . Such comparisons are especially valuable for the valida-
tion or fine-tuning of hetero-/homogeneous reaction mechanisms.
PLIF signals of flame-produced radicals, such as those discussed
in  Sections  3 –6  and  Fig.  49 (a)  are  typically  strong,  facilitating
quantitative analyses of flame/catalyst radical coupling. However,
radicals produced by the catalytic pathway alone have much lower
concentrations  such  that  their  quantification  with  LIF  or  PLIF  is
challenging.

7.2. LIF and absorption techniques for radical assessment in catalytic
processes

The catalyst is a very efficient sink of radicals (OH, H, O) that
are created by gaseous chemical reactions, but at the same time it
is a poor producer of them [19,45] . Considering the fuel-lean H
2 /air
atmospheric pressure case in Fig. 27 , the homogeneous ignition po-
sition predicted with the Deutschmann/Warnatz mechanisms [138,
ig,g = 82 mm. A reaction flux diagram just upstream of ho-

mogeneous ignition ( x = 78 mm) is shown in Fig. 50 (a) and trans-
verse  profiles  of  OH,  extending  1.5 mm  from  the  Pt  catalyst,  are
given in Fig. 50 (b) for x = 28 and 78 mm. Predictions in Fig. 50 (b)
refer to three catalytic reaction mechanisms: Deutschmann et al.
[138] ,  Kasemo  (Fridell  et  al.  [193] )  and  Schmidt  (Hickman  and
ig,g = 82 mm is approached, the OH fluxes turn
Schmidt [194] ). As x
from  net-desorptive  ( Fig.  50 (b1))  to  net-adsorptive  ( Fig.  50 (b2)).
The radical adsorptive/desorptive fluxes of OH, O and H shown in
Fig. 50 (a) are orders of magnitude smaller than the correspond-
ing  fluxes  of  main  species.  Further,  while  gas-phase  combustion
creates  appreciable  OH  (in  Fig.  27  the  post-ignition  OH  reaches
a maximum of 120 ppmv), in the catalytically-dominated regions
x < < x
ig,g the OH radical attains sub-ppmv values ( Fig. 50 (b1)). De-
spite the small radical concentrations and fluxes at x < x
ig,g , their
magnitude  is  important  for  the  construction  of  reliable  catalytic
reaction  mechanisms,  since  radical  fluxes  couple  to  the  homo-
geneous reaction pathway and can also control catalytic ignition
[155,195] .

LIF of catalytically-produced radicals is typically carried out at
low  pressures  (up  to  a  few  hundred  Torr)  to  mitigate  contribu-
tions from gas-phase chemistry and to facilitate signal quantifica-

tion by minimizing quenching. OH LIF above Pt surfaces has been
reported in [193,196–200] , while OH, O and H radicals have been
determined by LIF over W surfaces in [201] and O radical by LIF
over Ir filaments in [202] . LIF of  radicals is also common in re-
lated chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes [203] . Early stud-
ies  in  Ljungström  et  al.  [196]  have  applied  LIF  of  OH,  which  is
produced  during  H
2  catalytic  reaction  over  a  stagnation-flow
heated  Pt  foil  at  pressures  2–200  mTorr,  by  scanning  the  laser
over  306.3–307.5 nm  in  the  A 2 (cid:16)+ ←  X 2 (cid:17) electronic  band.  They
have determined absolute values of OH wall fluxes (by scanning
the laser and summing transitions from all important populated
initial states) which, contrary to the gaseous-chemistry-dominated
studies in Fig. 49 (b), are desorptive. Fig. 51 (a) presents normalized
desorptive fluxes (from the deduced absolute values) as a function
of relative H
2 concentration. Such absolute measurements are very
important for the development of catalytic reaction mechanisms.
Försth et al. [199] applied OH-PLIF in the stagnation point flow Pt
foil of Ljungström et al. [196] at pressures 0.2–120 Torr, and de-
termined transverse OH profiles by approaching the Pt foil within
0.2 mm. Fig. 51 (b) compares measured normalized OH concentra-
tion transverse profiles with simulations obtained using the cat-
alytic reaction mechanism in [200] at three different pressures and
a Pt foil temperature of 1300 K. It is concluded that OH is solely
produced from the surface at pressures up to 1 Torr. The compar-
isons in Fig. 51 (b) attest the suitability of the catalytic mechanism
at the investigated low pressures.

LIF is further applied to determine absolute concentrations of
OH, O and H radicals during the catalytic decomposition of H
2 /O
2
mixtures  over  tungsten  [201] ,  with  measurements  performed  at
a  fixed  distance  9 cm  above  the  W  surface.  Four  laser  spectro-
scopic  techniques  are  applied  to  deduce  H-atom  densities:  vac-
uum ultraviolet (VUV) laser absorption at 121.6 nm for determining
absolute  densities,  vacuum-ultraviolet  LIF  (VUV-LIF),  two-photon
LIF at 243.2 nm exciting to H(2 s 2 S ) and finally two-photon LIF at
205.1 nm exciting to H(3 s 2 S , 3 d 2 D ). For the much smaller O-atom
density only the VUV-LIF technique is applicable at 130.2 nm, while
VUV laser absorption and two-photon LIF exhibit too low sensitiv-

ities [201] . Only the 3 P
2  state of O atoms is measured. The ratio
of the total population of O atoms to that of O( 3 P
2 ) is 1.5 at 450 K
but depends weakly on temperature. Finally, OH radicals are de-
tected  by  LIF  in  the  ultraviolet,  corresponding  to  the  (0.0)  band
of the A 2 (cid:16)+  ← X 2 (cid:17) transition. Absolute density of OH was de-
duced by comparing the LIF intensity under saturated conditions
with the Rayleigh scattering intensity produced by Ar. Measured
absolute densities of the three radicals at a pressure of 17 Pa are
given in Fig. 52 as a function of the O
2 flow rate. Although the ap-
plication of interest in [201] is CVD, the same techniques can be
applied to the catalytic oxidation of H

2 and other fuels.

Interpretation of the LIF signals requires care to eliminate po-
tential contribution of gaseous chemistry, which, for catalyst tem-
peratures 120 0–130 0 K becomes appreciable already at 1 Torr (see
Fig.  51 (b)  and  [199] ).  Therefore,  comparisons  such  as  those  in
Fig. 51 (b) require including in the simulations, apart from the cat-
alytic  mechanism,  a  reliable  gas-phase  reaction  mechanism.  Par-
allel  tests  over  heated  nearly  catalytically-inert  surfaces  can  fur-
ther  unravel  the  impact  of  gaseous  chemistry.  Measurements  at
lower catalyst temperatures, whereby LIF or conversional adsorp-
tion  techniques  lack  the  required  sensitivity,  are  still  needed  to
benchmark catalytic reaction mechanisms. As radical densities are
greatly reduced, other spectroscopic techniques such as cavity ring
down spectroscopy (CRDS) [205] can be employed. CRDS is an ul-
trasensitive (down to ∼100 ppb) multipass absorption technique,
which  produces  the  line-of-sight  integrated  absorbance  (LIA)  for
the chosen probe transition of the radical species. The LIA can be
converted to an absolute line-of-sight column density and finally
to a species number density. Although CRDS is common in CVD
studies [204,206,207] and in gaseous combustion [208,209] , its ap-
plication to catalytic reacting systems is limited [210] . Fig. 53 pro-
vides measured and predicted (using a 2-D model) column density
distributions of C
2 plasma gas of a
diamond–growing reactor as a function of distance above the sub-
strate.  Therein, laser light at  ∼515 and ∼431 nm is  used for  the
2 ( α,  v = 0)  and  CH( X ,  v = 0)  [204] .  CRDS  measure-
detection  of  C
ments over catalytic surfaces can extend the foregoing LIF and con-
ventional absorption studies of radicals to low temperatures and
practical pressures. Stagnation point flow catalytic reactors are best
suited for CRDS measurements. In the channel reactor of Fig. 6 , two
narrow slots on the side quartz widows are deemed necessary as
the multipass beam arrangement cannot tolerate optical windows
between the two cavity mirrors.

7.3. LIF of stable species in catalytic processes

Heterogeneously  catalyzed  stable  gaseous  reactants,  either  in
trace  amounts  or  in  major  concentrations,  can  also  be  interro-
gated with PLIF. Probing main reactants with LIF or PLIF may pro-
vide an alternative to the weaker Raman technique elaborated in
Sections 3 –6 . Nonetheless, not all stable species are accessible by
LIF  and  further,  the  fluorescence  signal  quantification  is  an  in-
volved process. Two-dimensional distributions of NO absolute con-
centrations obtained with NO-PLIF in an atmospheric-pressure, op-
tically  accessible,  2-mm-high  catalytic  channel  [211]  are  shown
in  Fig.  54 .  The  application  refers  to  the  catalytic  reduction  of

quenching corrections are further applied to obtain the absolute

At the University of Lund, PLIF imaging of CO and CO

2 during
low-pressure ( ∼150 mbar) CO oxidation over catalytic surfaces has
been advanced in the last five years [212–216] , employing various
optical schemes. In Blomberg et al. [214] detection of CO and CO
2
is accomplished by two separate laser systems. CO-PLIF involves a
picosecond laser system consisting of an Nd: YAG laser with an ex-
ternal amplifier and an optical parametric generator (OPO) produc-
ing a broadband UV beam, while the CO
2 -PLIF employs a nanosec-
ond laser system comprising an Nd: YAG laser, a dye laser, and a
mixing unit, creating a tunable narrowband infrared laser beam. A
later development [216] uses a nanosecond Nd:YAG/dye laser sys-
tem along with a broadband mid-infrared OPO for imaging both
CO and CO
2 . CO is detected via fluorescence in the visible spec-
trum (450–660 nm) of the B 1 (cid:16)+ → A 1 (cid:17) transition by two-photon
excitation of the X 1 (cid:16)+ → B 1 (cid:16)+ transition at 230.1 nm, whereas CO
2
is  detected  via  mid-infrared  fluorescence  from  the  ∼4.3 μm  fun-
damental band via broadband excitation at ∼2.7 μm. PLIF images
of  CO  and  CO
2 ,  averaged  over  10  laser  shots,  are  illustrated  in
Fig. 55 .

Attempts  have  been  made  to  quantify  the  signal  (see  color-
coded  bars  in  Fig.  55 ).  When  transverse  species  profiles  are  ex-
tracted  and  comparisons  with  simulations  become  available,  the
full potential of this technique for demanding kinetic studies will
be better assessed. While comparisons of measured and predicted
transverse reactive species profiles have not yet been made, first
comparisons of measured point CO concentrations (referring to a
small  volume  at  a  location  above  a  Pd(100)  surface)  and  corre-
sponding kinetic Monte Carlo simulations have been reported in
[217] . Furthermore, while currently limited to CO and CO
2 species
and to low pressures, successful advancement to realistic pressures
and  additional  species  may  provide  a  powerful  quantitative  tool
for kinetic analyses, as the established Raman technique discussed
in Sections 3 –5 . Of more interest, however, is the potential of the
stable-species PLIF technique for the investigation of dynamic pro-
cesses (the averaging over 10 laser shots in Fig. 55 can probably
be removed) due to its much stronger signals compared to Raman,
issues that will be elaborated in the coming section.

8. Dynamic processes

Single-shot pulsed (nanosecond) laser measurements at low fre-
quencies  or  more  demanding  time-resolved  measurements  with
high-repetition rate pulsed lasers are necessary to probe turbulent
flows over catalytic surfaces [50,156] , intrinsic catalytic instabilities
[218,219] , and transient operation during startup or shut down of
practical systems [37,186,220] . Turbulence and intrinsic instabilities
along with the measuring techniques are discussed in this section.

8.1. Turbulent hetero-/homogeneous combustion

The  interaction  of  heterogeneous  or  hetero-/homogeneous
chemistry  with  turbulence  is  of  main  interest  for  pollutant
abatement  in  automotive  converters  [221] ,  for  hybrid  hetero-
/homogeneous  combustion  in  gas-turbines  [16,222] ,  and  for  the
synthesis  of  various  chemicals  from  hydrocarbons  [223] .  In  cat-
alytic  automotive  converters  the  trend  nowadays  is  to  promote
transition  to  turbulence  using  suitable  geometric  modifiers.  Tur-
bulent transport can increase the converter effectiveness by up to
30%  [221,224]  and  hence  decrease  the  system  length  and  noble
metal usage. In gas-turbines, the inlet Reynolds numbers based on
the individual catalytic channel hydraulic diameter can reach up
to 20,0 0 0 [11] . In fuel-processing technologies, which involve cat-
alytic  reforming  of  hydrocarbons  to  syngas  followed  by  Fischer–
Tropsch  (F–T)  synthesis,  there  are  design  benefits  in  operating
both reforming and F–T at the elevated pressures dictated by the
downstream F–T. High-pressure operation typically results in high
Reynolds numbers and hence to turbulent flows. While the auto-
motive converters are nearly isothermal with only catalytic reac-
tions, in power generation the large exothermicity of the catalytic
pathway along with the high pressures may lead to the complexity
of turbulence coupled with hetero-/homogeneous combustion.

Turbulent hetero-/homogeneous combustion over Pt has been
investigated in the 7-mm channel height of Fig. 6 [50,156,225] for
fuel-lean H
2 /air mixtures at atmospheric pressure. A fully devel-
oped  turbulent  channel  flow  is  provided  at  the  channel  entry
[50]  and  characterized  by  laser  Doppler  velocimetry  (LDV).  The
Raman/OH-PLIF methodology inside the channel is complemented
with  particle  image  velocimetry  (PIV)  flow  measurements,  car-
ried  out  on  the  same  plane  as  the  OH-PLIF  [50] .  Channel  do-
mains  44 × 7  mm 2  (in  x  and  y ,  respectively)  are  recorded  on
1280 × 204 pixels of a CCD camera, while the velocity field is an-

eling  is  performed  with  low-Reynolds  number  (LR)  variants  of
Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes models (LR-RANS [50] ). 3-D direct
numerical  simulations  (DNS)  are  further  conducted  in  a  channel
with a smaller height of 5 mm [8,226–228] . Key results are pre-
sented  next,  exposing  the  advantages  and  current  limitations  of
current laser-based measurements and the implications to turbu-
lent closures.

8.1.1. Impact of surface exothermicity on turbulent flow

The intense heat transfer from the hot catalytic walls dampens
turbulence and laminarizes the flow. The laminarization process is
illustrated by comparing in Fig. 56 measured instantaneous span-
wise vorticity maps for a catalytically reacting case with an inlet
IN = 16,110 (based on the mean inlet ve-
bulk Reynolds number Re
locity, the inlet gas properties and the 7 mm full channel height)
and  for  the  same  Re
IN  under  isothermal  flow  conditions  (296 K)
obtained by using uncoated (non-catalytic) Si[SiC] channel plates.
The wall temperature profile for the reacting case in Fig. 56 (a) is
provided in Fig. 57 (Case 1). High-vorticity elongated structures in-
clined at 40 °-50 ° with respect to the streamwise direction are evi-
dent in Fig. 56 (b). However, under catalytic reacting conditions, the
increase in gas viscosity due to heat transfer from the hot walls
alters this topology and decreases appreciably the vorticity magni-
tude. The blocked areas near both channel walls in Fig. 56 lack PIV
data; these areas are broader in the reacting case (Fig. 546(a)) due
to low gas density and thermophoresis effects. Velocity vectors as
close as 0.25 mm to the channel walls are determined in the non-
reacting cases, while in the reacting cases this distance is increased
to 0.65 mm.

The  aforementioned  picture  of  laminarization,  owing  to  the
suppression of vorticity components parallel to the catalytic walls,
has  been  confirmed  in  recent  3-D  DNS  [227] .  The  simulated  3-
D domain is depicted in Fig. 58 (a) and comprises a 5-mm-height
planar channel with a chemically-inert and isothermal (320 K) up-
stream recycling flow section ( L

Raman/OH-PLIF/PIV  experiments  and  turbulence  modeling  for
the three cases in Fig. 57 are applied to investigate the turbulent
catalytic processes. Raman and OH-PLIF images are time-averaged
to  increase  to  signal-to-noise  ratio.  The  modeling  employs  low-
Reynolds (LR) number RANS turbulence models, a presumed-shape
(Gaussian)  probability  density  function  closure  for  the  average
gaseous  reaction  rates,  and  a  “laminar-like’  closure  for  the  aver-
age  catalytic  rates.  The  large  thermal  inertia  of  the  9-mm-thick
catalytic walls in the channel of Fig. 6 removes the major Arrhe-
nius exponential non-linearity by suppressing temperature fluctu-
ations, such that  ̃  ̇ s

gaseous and surface species, respectively, which are involved in the
reaction  rate  of  the  k th  species.  The  detailed  catalytic  and  gas-
phase reaction mechanisms [138,139] validated in Section 4.1 un-
der laminar flow conditions are employed, thus removing kinetic
uncertainties that would have otherwise complicated the assess-
ment of turbulent transport and turbulent closures. The suitabil-
ity of a specific near-wall LR turbulence model crucially depends
on  its  ability  to  capture  the  flow  laminarization  induced  by  the
velocity  drop  due  to  wall  proximity  and  most  importantly  due
to  intense  wall  heat  transfer.  LR  turbulence  models  for  catalytic
combustion  must  be  overdissipative  compared  to  standard  high
Reynolds  number  models.  Three  different  LR  turbulence  models
have been tested. The first is the two-layer model from Patel (Chen
and Patel [230] ) developed for non-heated channel flows; it is typ-
ical to most isothermal LR models accounting only for wall prox-
imity and serves for comparison with two heat-transfer LR mod-
els. The LR model from Ezato (Ezato et al. [231] ) is developed for
strongly laminarizing heated channels and the LR model from Lin
(Hwang and Lin [232] ) is constructed for channel flows with and
without heat transfer.

ditions are applied in the spanwise z -direction. Catalytic combus-
2 /air ( φ = 0.24) at atmospheric pressure is modeled with

process of turbulent flow laminarization. Two bulk inlet Reynolds

Instantaneous  vorticity  iso-surfaces  according  to  the  λ

Fig.  58 (b)  for  the  two  Reynolds  numbers  (all  quantities  are
non-dimensionalized  by  the  channel  half-height  b = 2.5 mm  and
the  inlet  properties).  Further,  color-coded  snapshots  of  the  non-
dimensional wall temperature gradient at the lower wall are in-
cluded in Fig. 58 (b) and are indicators of the instantaneous heat
transfer to the gas. The effect of Reynolds number on the topol-
ogy  and  density  of  vortical  structures  is  evident,  while  the  vor-
ticity suppression along the streamwise direction clearly manifests
a laminarization process in qualitative agreement with the exper-
iments  in  Fig.  56 .  The  impact  of  flow  laminarization  due  to  the

Measured  and  predicted  transverse  profiles  of  the  Favre-
averaged mean velocity   ̃ U and Favre-averaged turbulent kinetic en-
ergy (TKE)  ̃ k are compared in Fig. 59 (1a, 1b) for Case 1. The Ezato
[231] LR model provides good agreement to the measured   ̃ U  and
fair to the measured   ̃ k . The Lin [232] model, and to greater de-
gree  the  Patel  [230]  model,  substantially  overpredict   ̃ U ;  further-
more, these two models result in considerably higher near-wall  ̃ k
( Fig. 59 (1b)) that in turn critically enhances transport of heat from
the hot wall towards the channel core, causing in turn an unrealis-
tic acceleration of the mean flow   ̃ U . Hence, only the Ezato [231] LR
model provides a realistically strong turbulence damping for cat-
alytic combustion applications.

Computed streamwise profiles of the Favre-averaged hydrogen
catalytic conversion rates are shown in Fig. 59 (1c) upstream of ho-
mogeneous  ignition  ( x < x
ig,g ).  Laminar  flow  simulations  are  also
included in Fig. 59 (1c), whereby the boundary conditions (mean
inlet velocities and surface temperatures) are kept the same but
turbulence  modeling  is  turned-off.  The  measured  catalytic  con-
version  (circles  in  Fig.  59 (1c))  is  deduced  from  the  Raman  and
PIV  velocity  measurements.  The  model  of  Ezato  [231]  provides
the  best  agreement  to  the  measured  hydrogen  catalytic  conver-
sion.  The  Lin  [232]  and  especially  the  Patel  [230]  models  result
in significant overpredictions, because of their corresponding large
overprediction  in   ̃ k  ( Fig.  59 (1b))  that  leads  to  increased  trans-
verse  mass  transport  towards  the  wall  and  consequently  to  en-
2  catalytic consumption. It is clarified that the catalytic
hanced H
chemistry is still fast enough to cope with the enhanced turbulent
transport, since computations yield a nearly transport-limited cat-
alytic H
2  conversion for all three models. The Ezato [231] model
underestimates  modestly  the  catalytic  hydrogen  conversion,  sug-
gesting  a  slightly  stronger  laminarization.  Interestingly,  the  lam-

DNS  for  the  reactive  species  H
while O
2 O have nearly the same turbulent diffusivities, the
lighter  hydrogen  exhibits  appreciable  deviations.  It  is  also  noted
that while turbulent scalar fluxes in open flows are modeled with
the molecular Schmidt number σ g included in (cid:3)t , this is not the
case in wall-bounded flows where σ g is typically constant and in-
dependent of the species molecular Schmidt numbers. These find-
ings  are  important  for  constructing  appropriate  models  for  tur-
bulent catalytic combustion, suggesting that better submodels are
necessary for the turbulent species fluxes. Scalar fluxes (
i ) al-
though adequately investigated in open flames [233] have not been
measured  near  reacting  interfaces.  Such  quantities  require  joint
velocity-scalar  point  statistics,  which  can  be  obtained  by  com-
bining  Raman/PIV  whereby  the  Raman  laser  is  fired  in  between
the two PIV pulses [234] . However, quantitative single-shot Raman
measurements  (even  when  point  and  not  line  (1-D))  simultane-
ously with PIV or laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is a quite de-
manding task near hot catalytic walls.

Both Eqs. (19) and (20) have the proper limiting behavior, as the
reaction rate ratios become zero for Da s = 0 and unity for Da s → ∞ .
For A = 2.3, Eq. (20) yields very good agreement [227] to the DNS
data as illustrated in Fig. 61 (b). The semi-theoretical expression in
Eq. (20) can be used to estimate turbulent catalytic rates and hence
conversions  in  practical  systems  (e.g.  conversion  of  a  pollutant
in  an  automotive  converter)  when  knowing  only  the  transport-
limited  turbulent  solution  (Da s → ∞ ),  a  quantity  much  easier  to
compute as it lacks intrinsic kinetics. Ongoing work focuses on de-

 ̇ s T /  ̇ s L , a quantity that even-
veloping closed-form expressions for
tually negates the need for turbulent simulations. Probability den-
sity  functions  of  instantaneous  local  hydrogen  catalytic  reaction
rates are given in Fig. 61 (c), extracted from the DNS data. Depend-
ing on the Reynolds number and catalytic reactivity, there can be
substantial  fluctuations  (up  to  300%),  suggesting  care  when  em-
ploying the ‘laminar like’ closure for turbulent catalytic rates dis-
cussed in the beginning of this section. Large fluctuations coupled
with even modest non-linearities in the concentration dependen-
cies (e.g. the reaction order of hydrogen on Pt is ∼1.15 [189] ) can
invalidate the ‘laminar like’ closure. This is further compounded by
the DNS-demonstrated capacity of solid walls in practical honey-
comb reactors (wall thicknesses 50–100 μm) to follow the temper-
ature fluctuations of the overlying gas [226] . Measurements of cat-
alytic reaction rate fluctuations is necessary for turbulent model

inar  predictions  in  Fig.  59 (1c)  are  in  better  agreement  with  the
measurements than the predictions with the Patel model or the
insufficiently-laminarizing  Lin  model.  Hence,  for  the  investigated
range of Reynolds numbers, a simple laminar model may perform
better than an inappropriate LR turbulence model [50,156] . The Ra-
man  technique  has  thus  provided,  despite  the  time-averaging,  a
valuable tool for testing and validating LR turbulence models for
catalytic combustion.

The enhanced turbulent transport profoundly affects the wall-
bounded  flames  in  Fig.  62 ,  as  it  reduces  the  available  residence
times across the gaseous combustion zones. Catalytic combustion
studies over stagnation point flows [235] have shown that, for a
deficient reactant with Lewis number less than unity, an increase
in the strain rate pushes the flame against the catalytic wall, lead-
ing to incomplete combustion through the homogeneous reaction
zone and subsequently to catalytic conversion of the fuel leaking
through  the  flame.  Additional  increase  in  the  strain  rate  extin-
guishes  the  flame.  Turbulent  transport  in  channel  flows  behaves
analogously  to  the  strain  rate  in  stagnation  point  flows.  In  the
Ezato LR model, the strong flow laminarization allows for longer
flame  residence  times  that  lead  to  sustained  near-wall  gaseous
combustion, in agreement with the OH-PLIF experiments in Fig. 62 .
Fig. 63 provides Raman-measured and predicted (using the Ezato
LR model) transverse profiles of H
2 O average mole frac-
tions for the three cases in Fig. 62 . The predicted transverse hydro-
gen profiles in Fig. 63 (1b-3b) indicate that, even well-downstream
of homogeneous ignition ( x = 205 mm > x
ig,g ), the catalytic pathway
converts  H
2  in  parallel  to  the  gaseous  pathway.  For  the  highest
Reynolds number Case 1 or for the lowest equivalence ratio Case 2,
the predicted transverse gradients of average hydrogen mole frac-
tion at the wall (marked with the thick solid lines in Fig. 63 (1b,
2b)) are non-zero, signifying fuel leakage through the flame zone.
This is also supported by the measurements in Fig. 63 , despite the
lack of Raman data within 0.5–0.7 mm from the walls. Fuel leak-
age is insignificant in Case 3 (the H
2 wall gradient is nearly zero)
since this case exhibits the strongest flow laminarization due to
its highest equivalence ratio and lowest Reynolds number. Finally,
it is pointed out that in catalytic combustion of fuels with Le < 1
the onset of homogeneous ignition is advantageous since the pres-
ence of a gaseous combustion zone moderates the superadiabatic
surface temperatures, as discussed in the context of Fig. 35 (a). The
aforementioned hydrogen leakage through the turbulent flame is
hence undesirable since, by increasing the relative contribution of
the  catalytic  pathway  to  the  consumption  of  hydrogen,  it  raises
the surface temperatures attained in practical reactors. Hydrogen
leakage through the gaseous combustion zone suggests local flame

development since DNS, although nowadays possible for a range of
industrial Reynolds numbers [227] , cannot be used as a design tool
in the foreseeable future. The experimental requirements for such
measurements are more severe compared to the foregoing turbu-
lent scalar flux measurements. Single-shot 1-D Raman is needed to
resolve the transverse gradient of the limiting reactant at or close
to the catalytic wall, and this is a formidable task. Potential ad-
vancement in the PLIF technique of stable species ( Section 7.3 and
Fig.  55 )  towards  quantification  may  provide  future  opportunities
for directly measuring fluctuations of catalytic rates.

8.1.3. Coupling of hetero-/homogeneous chemistry and turbulence

PLIF-measured and predicted (using the Ezato LR model) maps
of OH are depicted in Fig. 62 for the three cases in Fig. 57 . The
Ezato LR model captures the measured homogeneous ignition dis-
tances (x
ig,g ) and flame shapes. On the other hand, no homoge-
neous ignition is achieved with the Patel LR model while the Lin
LR model leads to homogeneous ignition only for Case 3, however,
with a resulting very short flame length as the flame extinguishes
shortly after ignition ( Fig. 62 (3c)). The large differences in homo-
geneous ignition distances and flame characteristics are directly re-
lated to the laminarization of the turbulent flow. The Patel and Lin
LR  models  produce  enhanced  turbulent  transport,  leading  to  in-
2 conversion as shown in Fig. 59 (1c);

8.2. Instabilities driven by heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical
reactions

Intrinsic instabilities owing to catalytic reactions alone as well
as flame instabilities during hetero-/homogeneous combustion are
finally discussed.

8.2.1. Catalytically-driven dynamics

Oscillatory dynamics driven by catalytic reactions has been in-
tensively  investigated  in  the  last  four  decades.  Early  works  re-
ported spatiotemporal oscillations in the oxidation of CO [236] and
H
2  [237]  over  Pt.  The  oscillatory  CO  oxidation  has  been  subse-
quently identified as an adsorbate-induced surface reconstruction
[238] . While first investigations attributed the oscillatory behavior
to intrinsic surface kinetics [239] , the coupling of kinetic bistabil-
ity  to transport limitations was also shown responsible for such
phenomena [240] . For the oxidation of hydrogen over Pt, Fig. 65 (a)
provides measured oscillations of catalyst temperature and H
2 con-
centration above the catalyst [241] . These oscillations are ascribed
to the coupling of kinetics and transport, with a periodic transi-
tion between kinetic-controlled and transport-controlled operation.
More recent measurements of oscillatory behavior during propane
oxidation on Ni [219] are depicted in Fig. 65 (b). Oscillations can
be periodic, with periods up to thousands of seconds as shown in
Fig. 65 , but also chaotic [242] .

Gas-phase  species  concentrations  are  measured  with  mass
spectrometry  either  at  the  exit  of  the  catalytic  reactor  or  with
microprobe  sampling  just  above  the  catalyst  surface.  The  lat-
ter  is  adopted  in  [241]  ( Fig.  65 (a)),  with  gas  sampling  0.1 mm
above  the  Pt  surface.  However,  transverse  H
2  profiles  have  not
been constructed (using e.g. a phase-locked technique) and this is
also the case in most kinetic oscillation investigations. Measure-
ments  typically  involve  in-situ  surface  spectroscopic  techniques
(e.g. XPS [219] ) to monitor the surface reconstruction and spatially-
unresolved measurements of gas-phase concentrations. Models are
subsequently constructed, based either on nanometer-scale Monte
Carlo approaches [243] that focus on the nature of surface recon-
structions, or on simplified low-dimensionality macroscopic mod-
els with mean-field kinetics [218,244] and sometimes with inclu-
sion of transport [245] aiming at quantitatively reproducing basic
oscillation characteristics. Such models require for validation mea-
surements of the local catalytic reactivity at various times during
an oscillation period. As set forth in Section 1.3 , the local catalytic
reactivity  can  be  assessed  with  transverse  1-D  Raman  measure-

extinction.  However,  the  time-averaging  nature  of  both  OH-PLIF
and Raman measurements hinders a detailed understanding of the
underlying processes. As with the fluctuation of catalytic rates in
Fig. 61 (c) a potential solution is PLIF of a major reactant (e.g. in
turbulent CO/air catalytic combustion) as shown in Fig. 55 . In this
case, single-shot CO-PLIF (or accompanying CO
2 -PLIF) can be used
not only to construct the transverse CO wall gradients for evaluat-
ing the instantaneous local catalytic reactivity but also to identify
the instantaneous homogeneous ignition location and flame shape.
Still, quantification of this PLIF technique is needed to extract in-
stantaneous concentrations so as to assess the combined catalytic
and gas-phase turbulent combustion processes.

Insights  into  the  underlying  hetero-/homogeneous  turbulent
combustion  processes  have  recently  been  obtained  [228]  with
3-D  DNS  in  the  geometry  of  Fig.  58 (a)  using  detailed  catalytic
[138]  and  gas-phase  [161]  chemistry  for  hydrogen.  Maps  of  in-
stantaneous hydrogen gaseous reaction rates near the lower wall
are given in Fig. 64 (a), demonstrating a flame topology with alter-
nating vigorously-burning and non-reacting (possibly extinguished)
islands.  The  non-reacting  (extinguished)  gaseous  zones  are  char-
acterized  by  underlying  intense  catalytic  reaction  rates,  as  seen
by  the  instantaneous  catalytic  ( C )  and  gas-phase  ( G )  streamwise
profiles  at  the  lateral  positon  z = 0  in  Fig.  64 (b).  Experiments
with  single-shot  resolution,  along  the  directions  set  in  the  pre-
vious  paragraph,  are  needed  to  confirm  this  picture  of  hetero-
/homogeneous  combustion  and  investigate  even  higher  Reynolds
numbers that not easily tractable by DNS.

ments  of  major  species.  The  periods  of  the  involved  oscillations
can be quite long (see Fig. 65 ) such that the 2 kHz repetition rate
pulsed Nd: YLF laser used for Raman in Fig. 6 can still be used
in  a  “time-averaging” mode  over  a  few  thousand  pulses  to  pro-
vide acceptable temporal resolution and at the same time adequate
signal-to-noise ratios. Application of the 1-D Raman technique will
give insight into the oscillatory catalytically-driven dynamics and
facilitate the fine tuning of models.

8.2.2. Flame instabilities over catalytic surfaces

The nonlinear interaction between walls and flames gives rise
to a wealth of combustion dynamics. Experimental and numerical
investigations have revealed many flame dynamics in non-catalytic
channels  with  hydraulic  diameters  less  than  10 mm,  which  fall
in  the  microscale  and  mesoscale  combustion  regimes.  Dogwiler
et  al.  [75]  applied  OH-PLIF  in  the  reactor  of  Fig.  6  with  non-
catalytic walls and reported asymmetric flames for CH
4 /air com-
bustion. Small experimental perturbations result in a random tran-
sition  between  an  upper  and  a  lower  asymmetric  flame  (see
Fig. 66 (a)). However, when the channel walls are Pt-coated, stable
symmetric flames are formed ( Fig. 66 (b)). Maruta et al. [246] stud-
ied  experimentally  premixed  hydrocarbon  flames  in  cylindrical
tubes  of  2 mm  inner  diameter;  they  observed  stationary  flames,
oscillatory  flames  and  repetitive  ignition  and  extinction,  at  dif-
ferent  values  of  the  inflow  velocity.  Phase-locked  OH-PLIF  in  a
1.5 mm height non-catalytic channel is reported in Fan et al. [247] ,
while  temporally-resolved  OH-PLIF  at  1 kHz  frequency  is  applied
in Brambilla et al. [35] for fuel-lean syngas/air combustion in the
channel of Fig. 6 . Oscillatory modes reverting from upper to lower
asymmetric flames are measured with the fast OH-PLIF ( Fig. 67 (a)).
High-fidelity transient simulations with detailed syngas gas-phase
chemistry  [181]  show  qualitative  agreement  with  the  measure-
ments ( Fig. 67 (b)). In terms of simulations, Pizza et al. [248] used

nels with heights ranging between h = 0.3 and 1.0 mm, reporting
stationary  symmetric  and  asymmetric  flames  as  well  as  oscilla-
tory flames for channels with h > 0.8 mm. In the mesoscale range
(2 ≤ h ≤ 7 mm) six combustion modes are observed [83] (mild com-
bustion, ignition/extinction, closed steady symmetric flames, open
steady symmetric flames, oscillating, and asymmetric flames). Fi-
2 /air  combustion  in  tubu-
nally,  3-D  simulations  of  fuel-lean  H
lar non-catalytic channels with diameters of 1.0 and 1.5 mm have
demonstrated spinning flame modes [33] . Fame dynamics in non-
catalytic  channels  is  under  continuous  investigation  in  the  last
years [249-251] and this topic has been covered in recent review
articles [25] .

Despite  the  extensive  experimental  and  numerical  work  on
flame  dynamics  in  non-catalytic  channels,  only  a  few  numerical
studies on flame dynamics have been reported in catalytic chan-
nels [84,85] . To investigate the impact of the catalyst on flame dy-
namics, the surface reactivity is controlled numerically. The inter-

perturbation.  Of  main  importance  is  that  the  undesirable  oscil-
latory flame modes are eventually suppressed by the catalyst, as
these  modes  can  compromise  the  reactor  performance  and  its
thermal stability. The numerical findings in Fig. 68 have not yet
been verified experimentally. Future experiments in channels with
varying catalyst loadings that mimic changes in the parameter F
can  shed  light  on  such  complex  phenomena.  As  the  oscillatory
frequencies typically range from a few Hz to a few hundreds of
Hz, fast OH-PLIF (as in Fig. 67 ) can easily follow the flame dynam-
ics. However, contrary to the much slower catalytic dynamics in
Fig. 65 , assessment of the catalytic reactivity with time-resolved
Raman  is  for  most  cases  precluded.  The  methodology  of  major
species PLIF ( Fig. 55 ) may provide a potential solution. Finally, it
is  interesting  to  note  that  no  work  (experimental  or  numerical)
has  yet  reported  simultaneous  occurrence  of  catalytic  dynamics
( Fig. 65 ) and flame dynamics ( Fig. 68 ); their disparate time scales
may suggest a weak coupling.

9. Summary and outlook

Over the last fifteen years significant advances have been made
in understanding the fundamental processes over reacting catalytic
interfaces  and  the  coupling  between  the  heterogeneous  and  ho-
mogeneous reaction pathways by applying non-intrusive gas-phase
diagnostics  above  catalytic  surfaces  at  industrially-relevant  oper-
ating  conditions  (pressures,  temperatures  and  reactant  composi-
tions). Theoretical modeling and numerical simulations are indis-
pensable tools for interpreting the measurements and identifying
key developments needed in experimental techniques, and for this
reason they have also been brought up in this review. Pulsed lasers
provide proper excitation sources for non-intrusive measurements
as they overcome thermal radiation and stray light interferences
from the hot catalytic surfaces. One-dimensional time-averaged Ra-
man measurements of major gaseous species along the normal to
the  catalyst  have provided  a  powerful  tool  for  directly  assessing
local catalytic reaction rates, quantities that cannot be deduced by
standard surface science measuring techniques. Moreover, combi-
nation of Raman with PLIF of a radical species allows for simulta-
neous evaluation of the catalytic and gas-phase reactivities. Theo-
retical work has identified the specific conditions that must be sat-
isfied when applying Raman/PLIF in order to avoiding falsification
of the kinetics of the one reaction pathway by the other.

Raman/PLIF measurements have been applied to determine the
pressure-dependence of the catalytic reactivity of various fuels on
noble metals and the conditions leading to the onset of homoge-
2 O or hot-oxygen
neous ignition. PLIF techniques exciting OH, CH
have allowed for monitoring homogeneous combustion at nearly
all  operating  conditions  of  practical  power  generation  and  fuel
processing systems. It has been shown that, contrary to the pre-
vailing view, homogeneous combustion cannot be easily mitigated
inside  catalytic  reactors,  despite  their  tight  geometrical  confine-
ments (catalytic channels with hydraulic diameters ∼1 mm) espe-
cially at the elevated pressures of many practical energy conver-
sion systems (hybrid hetero-/homogeneous combustion in power
generation,  or  partial  oxidation  reactors  in  fuel  processing  tech-
nologies). Raman/PLIF measurements and simulations in fuel-lean
CH
4 /air combustion over noble metals demonstrate the need for
further advancement of gas-phase chemical reaction mechanisms
at the extreme operating conditions of practical catalytic reactors
(ultra-low equivalence ratios, modest temperatures). Diffusionally
imbalanced reactants cause appreciable deviations of the surface
stoichiometry  from  the  bulk  gas-phase  stoichiometry  and  exem-
plify  the  need  of  accompanying  numerical  simulations  for  inter-
preting the measurements.

The Raman technique can assess catalytic reaction rates of main
reactants, quantities of prime interest when constructing and val-

The factor F is zero for a non-catalytic wall, while the impact of
catalytic chemistry on flame dynamics is investigated by gradually
increasing F to values above zero. In practice, this can be realized
by progressively increasing the loading of the active catalyst on the
washcoat.

High-fidelity  transient  simulations  have  been  performed  for
H
2 /air mixtures with detailed catalytic [138] and gas-phase chem-
istry [159] in channels [84,85] . The computed flame modes have
been mapped as a function of the inflow velocity, U
IN , and the cat-
alytic reactivity parameter F . The flame dynamics for an h = 2 mm
channel height are presented in Fig. 68 for three values of the re-
activity parameter, including the non-catalytic (only homogeneous
combustion) case F = 0. To simplify the graphical demonstration of
the flame solutions, the parameter h
Tmax has been defined in the
vertical axis of Fig. 68: it defines the transverse distance from the
lower  channel  wall  ( y = 0)  to  the  location  of  maximum  temper-
ature,  normalized  by  the  channel  height  h .  For  symmetric  com-

greater or smaller than 0.5. Flame modes for the catalytically in-
ert  wall  ( F = 0)  are  shown  in  Fig.  68 (a)  [83] :  the  include  mild
combustion, repetitive ignition/extinction, closed steady symmet-
ric flames, open steady symmetric flames, oscillating flames and
steady asymmetric flames. Vertical arrows in Fig. 68 (a) indicate the
bifurcations between the different flame types as the inlet velocity
changes.

The  lowest  studied  catalytic  reactivity  ( F = 0.003,  Fig.  68 (b))
suppresses  the  mild  combustion  and  the  oscillatory  igni-
tion/extinction  modes.  An  increase  in  F  narrows  the  range  of
inflow  velocities  over  which  oscillating  flames  exist  ( Fig.  68 (b))
and eventually completely suppresses them ( Fig. 68 (c)). Asymmet-
ric flames persist even for F = 0.0175 ( Fig. 68 (c)). The asymmetric
modes  are  quasi-stationary,  and  they  shift  from  upper  to  lower
asymmetric  solutions  upon  introduction  of  a  small  numerical

idating  a  surface  reaction  mechanism.  Catalytic  reaction  rates  of
trace species are also important as secondary reaction pathways
during steady operation or sometimes as controlling pathways dur-
ing transient processes (catalytic ignition). PLIF or point LIF have
been applied to catalytically produced radicals in the absence of
homogeneous chemistry and have provided quantitative measure-
ments  for  the  desorptive  radical  fluxes.  Such  measurements  are
crucial for the fine tuning of catalytic reaction mechanisms. Exten-
sion of these measurements to lower surface temperatures strains
the LIF technique such that other approaches (such as cavity ring
down spectroscopy, CRDS) can be applied in the future. Further,
PLIF of main reactants has progressed recently –albeit limited to
2 species. Potential quantification of this technique will
CO and CO
open new opportunities, especially in studying dynamic phenom-
ena near catalytic surfaces.

Transient  processes,  such  as  turbulent  hetero-/homogeneous
combustion and intrinsic instabilities (heterogeneous or homoge-
neous)  in  catalytic  systems  can  be  tackled  by  non-intrusive  di-
agnostics  in  the  gas  phase.  In  turbulent  hetero-/homogeneous
combustion, time-averaged Raman and OH-PLIF measurements re-
vealed that fuel is converted in parallel by the catalytic and gas-
phase  reaction  pathways,  suggesting  local  flame  extinction  and
subsequent catalytic conversion of the fuel underneath the extin-
guished  flame.  Clarification  of  this  picture  is  hindered  by  chal-
lenges in carrying out single-shot 1-D Raman measurements near
reacting  hot  walls  and  here  DNS  has  provided  insight  into  the
underlying processes. Assessment of the local catalytic rate fluc-
tuations  is  cardinal  for  the  development  of  closures  in  turbu-
lent  hetero-/homogeneous  combustion  models  and  opportunities
for  such  measurements  may  exist  with  PLIF  technique  of  major
species.

An  outlook  is  finally  outlined.  This  review  has  demonstrated
the capacity of gas-phase species laser-based techniques to deter-
mine the local catalytic reactivity (Raman) and the onset of ho-
mogeneous ignition (PLIF). However, the state of the catalytic sur-
face cannot be probed during reactor operation. While ex-situ sur-
face science measurements have been performed in the channel-
flow reactor of Fig. 6 [19,131] , the local state of the surface can-
not be simultaneously assessed. Nowadays, in situ surface science
techniques are applied in special cells to measure several surface
properties. For example, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) de-
termines surface elements (Pt, Rh etc.) by probing their electronic
transitions, diffuse reflectance infrared (IR) Fourier transform spec-
troscopy  (DRIFTS)  determines  surface  species  by  vibrational  fre-
quencies in the IR and surface-Raman interrogates species vibra-
tions in the visible. In situ, surface science measurements have ad-
vanced and are now regularly applied at realistic pressures [252–
256] .  An  atmospheric  pressure  differential  cell  dedicated  to  IR
and X-ray surface science measurements is illustrated in Fig. 69 (a)
[252] . A sample comprising powdered catalyst is positioned inside
a cell with windows allowing XAS in the transmission mode (oper-
ation in the fluorescence mode, XAFS, is also possible) and DRIFTS.
The  differential  cell  in  Fig.  69 (a)  still  faces  the  same  limita-
tions as the microflow reactor ( Fig. 5 (a)) discussed in Section 1.3 .
It is herein proposed to combine gas-phase laser diagnostics (PLIF
and Raman) with surface science measurements in a channel-flow
catalytic reactor ( Fig. 69 (b), cell under construction). A thick cata-
lyst layer coated on one channel wall allows for simultaneous X-
ray transmission and optical transmission for gas-phase diagnos-
tics (PLIF of radicals and potentially of major species, as well as
Raman), as depicted in Fig. 69 (b). This approach would allow link-
ing the local state of the catalyst surface (determined with XAS,
DRIFTS) to the local catalytic reaction rate (determined with gas-
phase Raman and possibly PLIF). Pressures up to 10 bar are envi-
sioned, hence facilitating hetero-/homogeneous combustion studies
with the aforementioned two types of measurements. Steady state

experiments are envisioned due to the time integration constraints
in the surface science techniques ( ∼100 ms). A similar approach for
combining operando surface science measurements and laser diag-
2 -PLIF and
nostics has recently been reported in [257] : therein, CO
synchrotron-based high-energy surface X-ray diffraction (HESXRD)
have been applied during the oxidation of CO over a Pd(100) sur-
face.

Further advancements in measurements near catalytic surfaces
may include three-wave mixing processes, such as coherent anti
Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) which has provided 1-D mea-
surements  of  species  and  temperature  above  inert  walls  [258] ,
even with single-shot time resolution [259] . Whether such single-
shot capacity can be maintained near catalytic hot surfaces with
large  depletion  of  the  reactive  species  is  a  research  topic  worth
pursuing. In addition, PLIF of major species ( Section 7.3 ) needs to
be quantified in order to fully expose its potential for catalytic re-
activity assessment. These future developments will foster funda-
mental  research  in  dynamic  processes  such  as  turbulent  hetero-
/homogeneous  combustion  and  flame  dynamics  in  catalytic  sys-
tems. Further, application of the PLIF technique of major species
to molecules other than CO and CO
2 is desirable. Along the same
lines, the Raman technique has so far been applied to low hydro-
carbons, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide; however, many practical
catalytic systems operate with liquid hydrocarbons [260] such that
the Raman spectroscopy of logistic fuels (octane and n-heptane)
must be advanced. Measurement of radicals produced by the cat-
alytic pathway at low temperatures suggests application of tech-
niques  other  than  LIF,  such  as  cavity  ring  down  spectroscopy
(CRDS) discussed in Section 7.2 . Finally, in terms of kinetic inves-
tigations the present review has shown the need for progress in
hydrocarbon  gas-phase  kinetics  at  ultra-lean  stoichiometries  and
moderate  temperatures  and  also  in  catalytic  kinetics  at  elevated
pressures.

Fig. 70.  Transient 2-D simulations of H 2 /air ignition in a 2-mm-height planar chan-
nel coated with Pt. The flow is laminar, while heat conduction in the wall (sold
thermal  conductivity  k s = 16 W/mK)  and  surface  radiation  heat  transfer  are  ac-
counted for; p = 1 bar, φ = 0.30, U IN = 5 m/s, T IN = 650 K. Temperature distributions
in the solid and gas are given at three times. (a) High-fidelity transient simulations
(DNS) resolving all time scales, (b) quasi-steady state (QSS) simulations, resolving
only the solid time scale.

In terms of simulations, multidimensional NS codes for laminar
channel  flows  capable  of  treating  detailed  hetero-/homogeneous
chemistry  and  heat  transfer  mechanisms  in  the  solid  walls
are  nowadays  available  and  crucially  facilitate  the  analysis  of
laser-based measurements. DNS in turbulent hetero-/homogeneous
combustion  with  detailed  catalytic  and  gaseous  hydrogen  reac-
tion mechanisms has been recently demonstrated at industrially-
relevant  Reynolds  numbers  ( Section  7.1 ).  Such  simulations  are
compounded  by  the  stiffness  of  the  catalytic  reaction  mecha-
nism,  which  has  characteristic  time  scales  six  orders  of  magni-
tude shorter than the corresponding ones of the gaseous pathway
[261] . For these reasons, the massive computational requirements
preclude the use of DNS for reactor design of industrial systems
and also for fundamental research of fuels with complex chemistry.
Therefore, development of reduced hetero-/homogeneous reaction
mechanisms [46] and also reduction of the numerical stiffness are
necessary steps. An attempt for stiffness reduction is illustrated in
Fig. 70 , where full DNS results are compared against results from a
NS quasisteady state (QSS) code developed in [37,189] . Both codes
employ detailed catalytic [138] and gas-phase [159] chemical re-
action mechanisms for the combustion of H
2 /air mixtures in a Pt-
coated planar channel. The QSS code resolves only the transient
solid heat conduction, while convection, diffusion, and chemistry
equilibrate within an integration time step of the solid. However,
care must be exercised since the QSS approximation may not be
valid  at  all  times  and  all  spatial  locations  in  the  catalytic  chan-
nel [37,189] . The comparisons in Fig. 70 between the DNS and QSS
results are very encouraging, and the QSS code is orders of mag-
nitude computationally more efficient than DNS. Stiffness reduc-
tion based on local time scale analysis (rather than imposing QSS)
within the framework of a DNS code is important for future code
development.
