There is abundant worldwide research into combustion engine applications for tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO).
However, many of these studies demonstrate conflicting or ambiguous results, so although the huge num-
ber of used tyres promises good availability for TPO, its role as fuel for transport applications is still
uncertain. This review  ́s goal is to clarify the case for TPO as transport fuel by means of a critical, wide-
ranging and updated review of TPO’s engine applications. The work gathers, collates and analyses the re-
sults of over 200 influential original research papers, aiming to answer the governing research questions
related to TPO production and quality, post-processing and quality improvement and its final end-use
engine validation. The work re-evaluates the environmental aspects of TPO technology, setting it against
the latest backdrop of growing climate change concern and the urgency to find alternative fuels. The hard
economics of TPO are also addressed, for example, assessing other end-of-life tyre management routes
and competing fuel alternatives.

The critical discussion on the key issues, including the most relevant drivers and boundaries, points
towards TPO’s use as a fuel component in marine, off-road and heavy-duty road applications. The re-
sults indicate that state-of-the-art production methods yield fuel that could be used directly in bunkering
chains for marine transport as low-sulphur fuel oil. Discussion reveals that automotive applications are
limited to blends not exceeding 10% tyre pyrolytic oil: sulphur and polyaromatic hydrocarbons contents
and particulate emissions are the main constraints. Pyrolysis process efficiency is high and feedstock for
TPO is both available and flexible. Waste tyre-derived pyrolytic oils could function as a supplementary
solution to biofuels, blended to take advantage of their complementary properties.

The particular added value of this review is that it bridges the latest knowledge from several domains
related to TPO fuel: industrial management, process chemistry, fuel science and combustion/engine re-
search. The resultant analysis is expressed in terms that are accessible to all those domains. It underlines
how studies from an individual domain perspective fail to produce the holistic view. The review creates
a route towards modern multidisciplinary research supporting TPO  ́s role in global transition to circular
economy.

1. Introduction and background

Global demand for crude oil continues to increase, propelled by
economic and population growth. Meeting the Paris Agreement’s
2  (carbon  dioxide)  reduction  goals  requires  radical  changes
CO
around the world. A significant reduction in fossil fuels is needed
across  all  fronts,  from  power  generation  to  manufacturing  and
transport. Although renewables’ share is increasing at a rate of 4%
per year, it is foreseen that in 2030 they can still only cover half of
the global increase in energy demand [1] .

Looking at fuel production, growth of gasoline consumption is
being  retarded  mainly  by  fast  progress  of  electrification  in  the
light-duty transport sector. Heavy-duty transport continues to rely
on  diesel  fuel  (DF)  due  to  its  high  energy  density  and  the  high
efficiency of compression-ignition (CI) engines [2] . Here, the fast
track  towards  sustainability  is  mainly  via  scaling  up  new  gen-
eration  drop-in  fuels  that  can  be  readily  used  in  existing  fleets.
Currently, there are two feasible renewable fuel production tech-
nologies  that  have  reached  industrial-scale  production  volumes:
transesterification and hydrotreatment of carboxylic acids. Trans-
esterification,  producing  mainly  fatty  acid  methyl  esters  (FAME),
is  more  widespread  due  to  the  simplicity  of  the  process.  Hy-
drotreatment,  yielding  hydrotreated  vegetable  oil  (HVO)  is  less
common  but  offers  greater  potential  because  the  end  product
has higher quality than esters or even diesel [3] . Moreover, HVO
can  be  produced  using  existing  refinery  infrastructure,  provid-
ing  high  process  efficiency.  Both  processes  have  one  significant
downside: limited flexibility on feedstock, which heavily relies on
first-generation bio-components, potentially competing with food
production [4] .

Pyrolysis is another promising concept for renewable diesel and
other types of fuels. The main advantage here is that a variety of
bio and synthetic waste materials (plastics, rubber, etc...) can be
used in the same reactor. More importantly, recent works indicate

a synergistic effect when co-pyrolysis of bio and synthetic material
is applied, reporting potential for process efficiency enhancement
and increasing the fuel mass yield [5] .

Another  aspect  of  the  sustainability  challenge  is  efficient  re-
cycling  of  waste  materials.  Management  of  automotive  shredder
residue and management of end-of-life tyres (ELTs) are of partic-
ular concern [ 6 , 7 ]. Waste tyres cannot be used in landfill due to
poor biodegradability and environmental hazards like fire and wa-
ter stagnation (supporting the proliferation of insects and bacte-
ria) [8] . The complex material structure which makes ELTs difficult
to process also creates a variety of residual streams. Steel fibres,
shreds,  oils  and  carbon  filler  can  be  recovered  from  used  tyres.
Tyres’  high  calorific  value  make  them  suitable  as  fuel  substitute
in waste-to-energy plants or as a feedstock to alternative thermo-
chemical  conversion  plants  for  both  energy  and  carbon  material
production [9] .

In the above context, pyrolysis of ELTs is currently a widely ex-
plored topic, with many works focusing on improving the process
efficiency and tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO) fraction yield [10–12] . At the
same time, crude TPOs and also their different distilled fractions
have been studied by many researchers as standalone fuel [ 13 , 14 ].
Others have studied the large-scale blending of TPO with other fos-
sil fuels [ 15 , 16 ] and biofuels [17] , or, in case of light distillates, as
a  renewable fuel  additive  (improver) [18] .  This  research involves
both laboratory analysis of fuel properties and evaluation of per-
formance by engine tests. Evaluating the current status of engine
research is particularly difficult due to a diversity of engine plat-
forms used in tests. For instance, contradictory results are quite of-
ten reported when exhaust emission effects are considered [ 13 , 15 ].
Similar discrepancies can be observed in terms of crude TPO pro-
duction, fractionation and quality improvement. These ambiguities
result from differences in feedstocks used, processing technology,
engine displacements and their technology level or the combustion
modes used during testing.

The  objective  of  this  work  is  a  comprehensive  assessment  of
the current state of the art in ELT conversion to mechanical power
through internal combustion engine applications. The introduction
section provides a background for the present work. It describes
the  overall  scale  of  the  problem  and  its  legislation  boundaries,
placing  pyrolysis  in  the  context  of  other  re-processing  technolo-
gies. The introduction is summarised by discussing the premise of
the present research in terms of its significance and the particu-
lar knowledge gaps it aims to fill. The main body of the work re-
views the current state of the art in tyre pyrolytic fuels, following
the process chain from production ( Section 2 ), through analytics
and upgrading ( Section 3 ) and finishing with end-use engine per-
formance ( Section 4 ). The work is summarised with an overview
and outlook section ( Section 5 ), culminating with conclusions.

1.1. Waste tyres - the scale of the problem, recycling routes and
legislation framework

The number of used tyres in the European Union (EU) is trend-
ing upwards, mainly because of the developing road transport and
light-duty  automotive  sectors  in  eastern  Europe.  A  report  from
the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers’ Association (ETRMA)
indicated  there  were  2.88 ×10 9  kg  of  used  tyres  (EU,  Norway,
Switzerland and Turkey) in 2013 and 3.58 ×10 9 kg in 2018, which
gives an average growth rate of 4% per year [ 19 , 20 ] A similar trend
is  observed  on  a  worldwide  basis,  with  a  global  amount  of  ELT
generated estimated in 2019 to be 29.1 ×10 9 kg [21] .

Currently, the management of used tyres in most countries is
regulated  by  legislation.  A  comprehensive  review  of  specific  EU
regulations affecting tyre deposition and treatment can be found in
[9] . Of over 15 sets of ELT legislation, certainly the most important
one is the Directive on the Landfill of Waste 10 0 0/31/EC, issued in
1999. This initiative basically prohibited stockpiling of whole tyres
in landfills, starting from July 2003, and scrapped tyres from July
2006.  As  a  result,  in  2010,  96%  of  the  EU’s  used  tyres  were  re-
covered for residual management [19] . The EU Circular Economy
Package of December 2015 also helped close the loop in used-tyres
management. It put particular emphasis on product reuse and sup-
porting  sustainability  by  extending  the  product’s  lifetime.  Reuse,
export and retreading (all classified as reuse) cumulatively account
for around 20% of all recycled tyres. In the case of ELTs (tyres that
cannot be reused), ERTMA identifies material recycling and energy
recovery as primary handling routes. Fig. 1 depicts how utilisation
of  waste  tyres  evolved  as  a  consequence  of  legislation  over  the
years. It is based on merged data from sources referenced in the
figure  ́s caption.

Generally,  the  ELT  market  is  currently  stable  in  Europe  with
country-to-country  variation  being  more  significant  than  the
change in the global trend. Material recycling is now the main han-
dling route (50%), followed by energy recovery (29%). The ELT man-

agement system in EU countries consists of three different models:
Extended  Producer  Responsibility  (EPR),  the  liberal  system  (free
market)  and  the  tax  system.  Under  the  first  system,  introduced
in the majority of EU member countries, manufacturers and im-
porters  of  tyres  are  obliged  to  ensure  that  tyre  wastes  are  dis-
posed of in an appropriate manner that does not harm the envi-
ronment [19] . The free-market system assumes that ELTs are im-
portant sources of valuable raw materials and that their recovery
and recycling are profitable, so the onus rests on commercial com-
panies to capture and harness the ELTs. That system operates in
Austria, Switzerland and Germany. In the case of the tax system,
applied in Denmark and Croatia, recovery/recycling organisations
are responsible for used-tyres management. This is financed by the
state via a tax levied on tyre manufacturers [19] .

Depending on the  country/system,  different stakeholders take
primary responsibility for management of ELTs and, ultimately, for
phasing-in new processing technologies. One of the main barriers
to application of tyres pyrolysis is unclear legal process definition.
According to the EU, depolymerisation of tyres by gasification or
pyrolysis  is  classified  as  a  destructive  process,  equivalent  to  in-
cineration (thermal waste treatment with or without heat recov-
ery). In fact, pyrolysis of ELTs should be considered as an energy
and material co-recovery process. Pyrolysis oil (TPO) and remaining
gas both can be used as energy sources or inputs for new materi-
als synthesis [26] . Thus, pyrolysis shows considerable environmen-
tal benefits over combustion/incineration which releases significant
amounts of CO
2 and extremely toxic substances. The former con-
tributes to climate change; the latter are dangerous for the envi-
ronment and human health [ 27 , 28 ]. Still, the emission legislation is
quite liberal for waste incineration processes, effectively inhibiting
the more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly processes.
In  summary,  current  EU  legislation  suppresses  the  opportu-
nity for tyre pyrolysis to take a major share in ELTs management.
To address this, closer collaboration between the joint alternative
management system of each country and the research community
should be promoted. A transition from Extended Producer Respon-
sibility to the free-market system could offer a better opportunity
for TPO. The ERTMA [29] and some research groups [8] are lobby-
ing for this, aiming to create a value-based drive towards more ef-
ficient and socially acceptable solutions in waste tyre management.

1.2. Waste tyre pyrolytic oil as a fuel for combustion engines: drivers
and boundaries

For  simplicity,  this  discussion  concerning  the  drivers  and
boundaries for TPO as engine fuel focuses purely on CI (diesel) en-
gines. These have the biggest demand for alternative fuels, as in-
dicated in Section 1 . Fossil DF, and on the alternative side, FAME
and HVO, currently the most feasible alternative for CI engines, are
mentioned in these discussions as references.

In terms of drivers, TPO fuels face the same economics as other
alternative fuels. Global fuel demand is rising by around 10% per
year and at the same time crude oil exploration is becoming more
expensive,  increasing  the  economic  feasibility  for  alternatives
[1] .  This  momentum  is  reinforced  by  numerous  CO
2  reduction
initiatives, with the 2015 Paris agreement being the most relevant
globally.

Tyre pyrolytic oils are produced from waste material and so are
classified  as  second-generation  fuels.  As  such,  they  have  a  more
favourable CO
2 factor on a well-to-wheel basis than popular biofu-
els FAME and HVO, assuming these are still majorly produced from
first-generation components (competing with food production) like
palm or rapeseed oil [30] . However, it is necessary to stress that a
detailed GHG emissions life cycle analysis for both fuel categories,
TPO and bio-oils, is extremely complex and heavily dependent on
geo-economic factors (see Section 2.4 for details).

The biggest challenge for FAME and HVO is limited flexibility
of feedstock. Data in the previous section and the percentage of
collected ELTs [ 20 , 31 ] suggest that waste tyres potentially available
for TPO production in 2019 could be estimated at around 2.7 ×10 9
kg per year in Europe alone, and growing at 4% per annum. This
is  assuming  the  current  ELTs  stream  split  for  applications  other
than energy. For comparison, European availability of oilseeds and
vegetable oils (which currently underpin over 86% of biofuel pro-
duction) accounts for 50 ×10 9 kg, but only around 13% of that (i.e.
about 6.5 ×10 9 kg) is available for fuel purposes due to strong com-
petition with food production [32] . Waste tyre availability for en-
ergy generation would increase if more sustainable and econom-
ically  feasible  solutions  are  developed,  making  this  use  of  ELTs
more attractive than direct material recovery. Pyrolysis (and gasifi-
cation) also provide feedstock flexibility, meaning the same reactor,
in principle, can be used to convert biomass, plastics and rubbers
from waste tyres. This co-pyrolysis of different f eedstocks provides
further pathways to improve TPO composition and yield [33] .

Aside from the general push to cut CO

2  emissions, the light-
and  heavy-duty  road  transport  sectors  have  their  own  country-
specific (or EU-wide) fleet-level CO
2 targets. The off-road sector is
currently discussing the adoption of similar limits, while the ma-
rine sector has its EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index). Without
going into detail, it is sufficient to say that, because all initiatives
refer to tank-to-wheel CO
2 emissions, none of them supports the
development of diesel-like alternative fuel. This applies equally to
TPO, FAME and HVO since all have a similar carbon to hydrogen ra-
tio, dependent more on the feedstock and refining processes rather
than on the fuel category itself.

The constraints for TPO as a fuel are mostly dependent on the
domain where the fuel is intended for use. Table 1 outlines the
selected physicochemical properties of the fuels determined by the
most relevant standards in different application domains. Note that
the  automotive  and  marine  fuel  regulations  are  considered  the

two  boundary  regimes  for  fuel  applicability  (least  and  most  in-
clusive, respectively) and from this perspective, we discuss them
more thoroughly. Selected regulations for the off-road sector are
provided for reference.

The EN 590 standard defines the fuel properties for compres-
sion ignition engines for European road transport. In the US, the
ASTM standard for automotive diesel fuels (No. 2-D) puts similar
requirements on fuel quality, although there is one major differ-
ence: ASTM  ́s minimum cetane number (CN) is significantly lower
than that of EN590. Generally, a well-known fact is that crude TPO
complies with neither EN 590 nor ASTM D-2 as a standalone, drop-
in fuel because of its high viscosity and large amounts of impuri-
ties [17] . Thus, most authors typically consider blending TPO with
DF  and/or  other  alternatives.  In  terms  of  alternatives,  note  that
neat  FAME  as  an  infrastructurally  mature  fuel  category  has  sep-
arate quality standards both in the EU and the US. For automo-
tive fuels, these standards are quite strict and yet EN590 still limits
the blending of FAME in commercial diesel to 7% by volume, while
ASTM D975 imposes a 5% limit.

The  other  commonly  considered  option  is  further  refining  to
produce TPO more compliant with EN 590, with distillation as one
of  the  more  straightforward  methods  [39] .  Poor  miscibility  with
diesel  is  another  constraint  if  TPO  is  considered  as  an  additive
[40] . In terms of further upgrading TPO, standard refinery infras-
tructure can be used to treat crude TPO with similar processes as
those  for  fossil  crude  oil  or  vegetable  oils,  including  hydrotreat-
ing, to arrive at ultra-clean distillates. These are covered in detail
in Sections 3 and 4 , considering both energy demand/quality and
end-use in engines.

The marine domain is still quite inclusive in terms of fuel qual-
ity. ISO 8217 is the current standard governing bunker fuel qual-
ity, and crude TPO, depending on the process and feedstock qual-
ity, can be directly considered in one of the distillate or residual
marine fuel categories (consult Table 1 ). Also, heavy fractions from
distilled tyre pyrolysis oil (DTPO) can be used to valorise the off-
stream from lighter distillates production. High viscosity and high
contamination do not pose a challenge, because marine diesel en-
gines  have  on-board  fuel  pretreatment  using  centrifugal  separa-
tors  and  preheaters.  However,  marine  ́s  sulphur  legislation  might
be challenging for TPO. The 2020 International Maritime Organi-
zation (IMO) sulphur cap limits a fuel’s total sulphur content to
0.5% on all international waters [ 41 , 42 ]. In the IMO’s Emission Con-
trol Areas (ECAs) the fuel’s sulphur limit is only 0.1% (10 0 0 ppm)
[41] . Desulphurisation methods for TPO are reviewed in detail in
Section 3.3 .

Aside from the fuel standards outlined above, emissions legisla-
tion has an indirect impact on fuel phase-in. Currently, all domains
where combustion engines operate are subject to strict emission
limits. In Europe, Euro VI is in force for light- and heavy-duty ve-
hicles, limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO
X ), unburnt hydro-
carbons (UHC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM).
Stage V regulations cover the off-road sector (including inland wa-
terways), but impose slightly less stringent NO
X , UHC and CO lim-
its, dependent on engine power output. In the marine sector, the
IMO  imposes  NO
X  limits:  Tier  III  regulations  apply  in  ECAs  and
Tier II regulations apply in waters outside the ECAs. For a com-
plete overview of current emission norms, the reader is referred to
DieselNet: Engine & Emission Technology Online [43] .

The  case  of  how  emission  legislation  either  supports  or  sup-
presses  individual  fuel  alternatives  has  three  dimensions.  One  is
the engine-out emissions (i), where different fuels have a different
internal predisposition to creating certain hazardous species. The
second  factor  (ii)  relates  to  how  the  fuel  affects  engine  perfor-
mance,  since  all  emission  limits  are  given  in  values  specific  to
generated power. Finally, (iii) all of the discussed emission legis-
lation currently in force, except IMO Tier II, require some sort of
exhaust  gas  aftertreatment  for  CI  engines  to  meet  the  imposed
limits. However, TPO can have a profound effect on performance
of catalysts used in aftertreatment. Notably, sulphur is limited in
automotive  diesel  fuel  because  it  is  a  catalyst  poison  for  diesel
oxidation catalysts, catalysts for NO
X  reduction by urea SCR, and
NO
X adsorbed catalysts. The EU 10 ppm and the US 15 ppm sul-
phur limits are thus not negotiable and would have to be met for
use in these applications. Section 4 of this review (Engine tests)
looks in more detail at the TPO studies that evaluated legislated
and unlegislated emissions.

1.3. Motivation, knowledge gaps and detailed scope of the present
work

The above introduction clearly shows that ELTs are an attrac-
tive feedstock for energy generation. Pyrolysis as fuel production
technology has potential to combine clean utilisation of tyres with
an efficient way of material recycling and energy recovery, while
avoiding the food-fuel dilemma. Furthermore, the flexibility of the
reactor permits greater feedstock availability through co-pyrolysis
of other synthetic waste (plastics) and biomass. In the face of the
global CO
2 reduction targets, this seems to be increasingly recog-
nised. The main hurdles for TPO to overcome relate to legislation,
production technology development and the technical aspects of

its use as an engine fuel. In all of those fields, there is currently
rapid  development  regarding  TPO  and  many  research  works  are
bringing new insights, greater knowledge and more efficient solu-
tions. This is communicated in original research papers but there
are also broader review works that summarise progress. Reviews
by Torretta et al. [8] and Antoniou and Zabaniotou [9] provide good
insight  into  legislation,  feedstock  availability  and  detail  forecasts
for ELTs management stream. The latter review by Antoniou and
Zabaniotou [9] is by far the most comprehensive study covering
the topics of tyre waste handling through pyrolysis. It has an ex-
tensive review of the production process, pyrolysis kinetics and its
products, including TPO. This study gives an excellent overview of
the topic yet it does not cover the fuel applications in great depth
and does not reflect the current state of the art in end-user val-
idation of TPO fuels through engine tests. Furthermore, it is now
seven years since the study was published, a period that has seen
significant development in tyre pyrolysis technology.

In terms of the fuelling applications, the knowledge gap is par-
tially  filled  by  a  more  recent  review  by  Czajczy  ́nska  et  al.  [44] .
This work is very detailed but focuses solely on the gaseous frac-
tion. Furthermore, the combustion applications are limited solely
to furnace combustion, providing heat to the pyrolysis process it-
self. Due to higher energy density (by volume) and easier logistics,
it is the liquid fraction of pyrolysis (TPO), not the gaseous fraction,
that holds potential as a transport fuel.

The  last  decade  has  seen  a  surge  in  research  into  TPO’s  use
as  combustion  engine  fuel  [45] .  Evaluating  the  current  status  is
very difficult due to the wide discrepancy in TPO quality, differ-
ent blending strategies and the variety of engine platforms used
hitherto. It was this combination of rapid progress, coupled with
the difficulty of building a complete and accurate picture from so
many disparate studies of TPO’s use for combustion engine appli-
cations, that motivated us to bridge this substantial knowledge gap.
The research questions addressed here are as follows:

i What is the current view on TPO well-to-tank environmental

impact and economic feasibility?

ii What  is  the  progress  in  pyrolysis  technology  with  respect  to

maximising the TPO yield and resulting fuel quality?

iii What are the available TPO-upgrading technologies and what is

their effect on the end fuel quality?

iv What is TPOs potential as a fuel component?
v How do different fuel compositions of TPO and TPO-derived fu-
els perform in the engine in terms of combustion characteris-
tics, efficiency and emissions?

6

As well as finding knowledge gaps, we recognize that there is
not widespread familiarity with TPO as an alternative fuel for com-
bustion engines. So, aiming to build a complete picture, this re-
view also provides an updated description of the state-of-the-art
process for tyre pyrolysis. The level of detail is sufficient to under-
stand the dependencies and to valorise the off-streams. This is cov-
ered in Section 2 , along with providing the input necessary for the
research question (i) and (ii). Consequently, the input for research
questions (iii) and (iv) is gathered in Section 3 . Section 4 provides
a  critical  review  of  all  aspects  of  the  research  question  (v).  The
introduction section provides the necessary legislative framework
to conduct the review in all sections. Finally, the discussion and
summary in Section 5 combine the individual inputs into a concise
roadmap of TPO fuelling applications.

The work is directed to scientists and engineers working in the
fuel industry and engine technology. Automotive and aviation sec-
tors  are  already  claiming  over  90%  of  available  biofuel  supplies,
leaving limited alternatives on the liquid fuel side for the marine
and off-road sectors. Thus, these sectors might be particularly in-
terested in the work. Hence the discussion is led with both auto-
motive and bunkering fuel legislation in mind. All sectors are con-
sidered when assessing engine emissions.

2. The state of the art in tyre pyrolysis

2.1. From waste tyres to fuel: process outline

Tyre pyrolysis can be described as a process of thermal decom-
position of solid organic compounds of ELT within limited access to
oxygen. During the thermo-chemical reactions, a series of volatile,
liquid and solid components are being produced [46] . Fig. 2 shows
a typical tyre material decomposition route through pyrolysis.

Most  often  the  tyres’  steel  components  are  removed  before
thermal  processing  and  rubber  parts  are  chopped,  cleaned  and
dried. Tyre pyrolysis generally consists of two stages: primary py-
rolysis and secondary cracking. During the initial phase, the vapour
or volatile products are generated, consisting of a variety of hydro-
carbons. From the point of view of this study, the liquid fraction -
TPO - is of main interest due to its possible application as a fuel.
The gaseous fraction can be reused to power the pyrolytic reactor
and make the process self-sustainable in energy terms. The solid
fraction (char) contains mainly carbon black, inorganic compounds
and many other carbon-based solids. Char can be utilised in a va-
riety of ways including substituting carbon black in the production
of new tyres. Therefore, by-products of the fuel recovery can pro-
vide energy savings as well as financial savings, when the entire

Seidelt et al. [52] proved that curves of a rubber DTG were char-
acterised by three temperature peaks, such as at 378 °C, 458 °C and
468 °C. The first step was attributed to depolymerisation of the BR,
while at 468 °C the decomposition of the cyclised and cross-linked
polymer residue was observed. Han et al. [53] however, conducting
a thermogravimetric mass spectrum analysis of waste tyres, iden-
tified four stages of this product’s thermal decomposition. The first
stage started below 320 °C and contributed a minor reduction of
mass due to vaporisation of water and decomposition of plasticiser.
The next stage occurred at 320-400 °C and related to the decompo-
sition of natural rubber. The third stage, at 400-520 °C, involved the
decomposition of synthetic rubber. Very little weight loss was ob-
served during the fourth and final stage, above 520 °C. The authors
associated the first three phases with the decomposition of differ-
ent polymer categories in the tyres: plasticisers (temperatures up
to 320 °C), natural rubber (320-400 °C), and synthetic rubber (400-
520 °C). As a final note, it should be pointed out that in terms of
temperature range and ELT material degradation stages, there is a
good agreement within various studies.

For a more fundamental perspective, the TGA analysis is com-
bined with chemical kinetics studies. Four general mechanisms are
usually  related  to  the  decomposition  of  organic  polymers:  ran-
dom chain scission, end chain scission, chain stripping and cross-
linking [54] . Small molecules of volatile alkenes and cycloalkenes
are produced form the degradation of rubbers due to chain scis-
sion processes. The main products of chain alkenes are: 2-pentene,
1,3-butadiene  and  isoprene.  These  are  formed  from  the  depoly-
merisation of natural and synthetic rubber [55] . The main cyclic
alkenes,  formed  from  the  degradation  of  natural  and  synthetic
rubber  or  the  cyclisation  of  chain  alkenes  consist  of:  5-methyl-
1,3-cyclopentadiene, 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene, D-limonene and
cyclonona-1,2,6-triene [ 56 , 57 ]. As the reactor bed temperature in-
creases,  alkenes  and  cycloalkenes  undergo  a  series  of  reactions
such as the Dies-Alder reaction and aromatisation, forming ben-
zene and its derivatives. Along with the increase of the tempera-
ture, the ring-opening and recyclisation reactions yield the forma-
tion  of  other  compounds  belonging  to  alkenes  and  cycloalkenes.
Mentioned reactions mostly occur in the initial stage of the whole
process. During the second stage, benzene and its derivatives un-
dergo further reactions to form more aromatic compounds such as
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [56] , which are problem-
atic from the point of view of exhaust emissions. The favourable
conditions for aliphatic compounds aromatisation to PAHs are high
temperatures  and  residence  time  [58] .  This  stage  of  pyrolysis  is
also associated with pyrolysis of D-limonene and styrene [ 56 , 59 ].

2.3. Tyre pyrolysis technology and the effect of operational
parameters on product composition

Commonly  used  pyrolysis  technologies  are  distinguished  by
the  heating  rate  and  residence  time.  The  reactor  type  used  can
be: fixed, moving, fluidised, spouted and vacuum types (refer to
Table 2 for detail). There are also some novel technologies, such as
microwave [ 60 , 61 ] and ultrasonic [62–64] . Moreover, various cat-
alysts can be applied to improve the quality of TPO, using a pro-
cess called catalytic pyrolysis [65–73] . Finally, it should be noted
that feedstock preprocessing can vary from the preparation of rub-
ber powder (required for fast heating), through centimetres-large
pieces, to pyrolysis of whole tyres [ 74 , 75 ]. Whole-tyre pyrolysis is
achieved using special reactors designed for both intermittent and
continuous operation [76] .

The content, as well as the properties and composition of in-
dividual pyrolysates fractions, may vary upon the technology and
conditions employed during the process. The amounts of polymer
types present in rubber significantly influence the product fraction
distribution, as well as the content of different hydrocarbons such

process is evaluated. Notably, all material and energy recovery re-
duces carbon footprint.

Further  processing  can  improve  the  properties  of  crude  TPO.
That usually involves sulphur removal, distillation and cracking. In
practice, the end fuels for engines are produced from TPO via frac-
tionation (fraction blending to obtain desired fuel properties) and
thus are referred to as distilled tyre pyrolytic oil or DTPO [47] .

2.2. Mechanisms of tyre pyrolysis

The  process  of  thermal  decomposition  is  most  often  charac-
terised  by  curves  of  the  mass  loss  versus  temperature.  Thermo-
gravimetry, often called thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), is an an-
alytical technique that measures the mass over a period of time as
the temperature changes [48] . So-called derivative thermogravime-
try (DTG) functions, using the same method but with different pre-
sentation data, are used to show the rate of decomposition.

The tyre rubber pyrolysis process TGA curve in Fig. 3 exhibits
two main stages. The first is the slow stage, related to the decom-
position of oils, plasticisers and additives present in rubber. The
second  is  the  active  pyrolysis  stage  which  involves  cracking  and
rapid decomposition of the other rubber components. The inter-
molecular associations and weaker chemical bonds are destroyed
during this second stage, resulting in gas and liquid fraction sepa-
ration. Beyond a certain temperature, active pyrolysis is essentially
completed, with only minor weight loss thereafter. This interpre-
tation  of  pyrolysis  mechanisms  was  introduced  by  Williams  and
Besler [48] and commonly adopted by others, e.g. Juma et al. [49] .
Leung and Wang [46] stated that the first stage’s temperature
range was between 150 °C and 350 °C. This is where oil, moisture,
plasticisers  and  other  additives  decomposed.  During  the  second
stage, above these temperatures but below 550 °C, natural polybu-
tadiene and polybutadiene-styrene rubbers (NBR and SBR respec-
tively) were decomposed. Using DTG function, the maximum de-
composition rates were observed between 380 °C and 450 °C. Prad-
han and Singh [50] conducted a TGA analysis of waste bicycle tyres
in  a  laboratory-scale  batch  reactor.  They  observed  that  the  first
stage of decomposition occurred at between 250 °C and 380 °C, fol-
lowed by the second stage at between 380 °C and 550 °C. This is de-
picted in Fig. 3 . Above 550 °C, the decomposition process was prac-
tically finished. TGA analysis conducted by Berrueco et al. [51] pre-
sented the thermal decomposition of a used car tyre (Michelin ra-
dial  X  type)  sliced  into  20  mm × 20  mm  pieces.  Decomposition
started at 200 °C and complete conversion of the sample had oc-
curred when the temperature reached 500 °C. However, the cited
authors  isolated  three  stages.  The  first  was  between  200 °C  and
325 °C, the second between 325 °C and 400 °C and the third stage
was between 400 °C and 500 °C. A DTG analysis of tyre pyrolysis by

as aromatics and olefins, in gas and liquid fractions. This section
gathers the state of the art in tyre pyrolysis technology and the
knowledge of how different pyrolysis parameters influence the fi-
nal product yield. The most relevant data is illustrated in Table 2 .
Note that a more extensive yet visually less impactful version of
this table is included as Appendix 1. The tabularised data is fur-
ther followed by a factor-by factor discussion. The focus is on max-
imising the yield of TPO, as this fraction is central to the present
review. The previous section summarising the mechanisms of py-
rolysis underpins the following discussion.

Table 2 presents an overview of generic types of reactors used
for ELT pyrolysis. Additionally, maximum TPO yields achieved by
different authors and key process parameters are provided. Note
that there are a few comprehensive reviews of ELTs pyrolysis tech-
nologies.  Therefore,  our  review  covers  only  the  most  important
technological  findings,  focusing  instead  on  properties  of  the  py-
rolytic products and their engine application.

Martínez et al. [114] differentiated between slow and fast py-
rolysis, which are distinguished by heating rate and vapour resi-
dence time. Generally, fixed-bed reactors and larger material parti-
cles normally are used for slow pyrolysis, which runs at lower tem-

peratures and takes minutes to hours. Rotary kiln and fluidised bed
reactors are the main types for fast processes, which are distin-
guished by small material particles, fast heating rates and vapour
residence times no longer than a few seconds. Czajczy  ́nska et al.
[44] also compared different types of reactors while differentiat-
ing  between  slow  and  fast  pyrolysis,  but  with  the  focus  on  gas
yield. The main conclusion was that fast pyrolysis yields more liq-
uid fraction, due to avoided secondary reactions, whereas the main
product of slow pyrolysis is a solid fraction. This statement is ob-
viously a simplification since the actual yield depends heavily on
process conditions. Nevertheless, it qualitatively illustrates the gen-
eral trend.

Another review by Lewandowski et al. [76] confirms this the-
sis by comparing results from different reactors. A more thorough
analysis of pyrolysis product composition related to reactor type is
depicted in Fig. 4 , summarising results obtained using different re-
actors, but at roughly the same process temperature of 500 °C. It is
evident from Fig. 4 that fluidised bed reactors provide maximisa-
tion of the TPO yield. Attainable TPO production efficiency for fixed
bed and mechanically mixed reactors is approximately 10% lower.
At this point, it should be emphasised that other process param-

Note that a handful of studies report TPO yield saturation at
certain temperature levels. Berrueco et al. [51] carried out pyrolysis
of waste tyres in an atmospheric-bed batch reactor at temperatures
between 300 °C and 700 °C. There was a lack of sensitivity in TPO
yield below 400 °C but yield was observed to gradually increase as
the temperature rose from 400 °C, reaching a maximum at 500 °C.
Further temperature increase did not affect pyrolysates yields. Sim-
ilar results were presented by de Marco Rodríguez et al. [86] , con-
ducting pyrolysis at a wide range of temperatures (30 0, 40 0, 50 0,
60 0 and 70 0 °C) in a nitrogen atmosphere. The cited authors ob-
served that a significant yield increase occurred at 30 0-50 0 °C and
peaked at 500 °C (38.0%). The yield remained at a similar level at
temperatures above 500 °C. The same tendency was noticed for the
gaseous fraction. Laresgoiti et al. [117] carried out pyrolysis in iden-
tical conditions to de Marco Rodríguez et al. [86] and presented the
same results. Laresgoiti et al. [116] observed the same tendency in
earlier work too. Aydın and  ̇Ilkılıç [118] also noticed that the max-
imum TPO yield (40%) was achieved at 500 °C and that it remained
at a similar level as the temperature was increased to 750 °C. How-
ever, the cited authors observed no correlation between gases and
oil fractions formation, contrary to the results of previous works.

The third general trend implies that TPO yield diminishes with
increasing temperature. This was reported by Williams and Brindle
[65] , Galvagno et al. [121] , Mastral et al. [122] and Aylón et al. [98] .
Aylón et al. [98] conducted nitrogen atmosphere pyrolysis at 600,
70 0 and 80 0 °C. They observed that as the temperature rose there
was a significant decrease in TPO yield fraction, an increase of gas
fraction and a relatively constant solid yield. The decrease of the
oil fraction and an increase of gases were explained by the cracking
of liquids. The same tendency was found by Galvagno et al. [121] ,
who examined three pyrolysis temperatures: 550, 600 and 680 °C.
The highest TPO yield (38.12%) occurred at 550 °C while the lowest
(31.82%) was at 680 °C. The gas fraction yield increased from 2.39%
at the lowest pyrolysis temperature to 10.75% at the highest.

For a great number of works, presented in Table 2 the limited
range of temperature sweeps performed makes it difficult to de-
termine with absolute certainty whether saturation or change in
monotony determined TPO yield as pyrolysis temperature rose. Fig-
ure 5 visualises the discrepancies already mentioned between in-
dividual results. Despite these discrepancies, some qualitative con-
clusions can be drawn from Fig. 5 and the above paragraphs. The
results indicate that there is a temperature window between 400 °C
and 800 °C in which TPO production is maximised. However, based
on different TGA curves, e.g. [ 50 , 70 , 123 , 124 ] the pyrolysis process
should be completed below 550 °C. This is because the pyrolysis is
not static, so the effects of temperature on TPO yield from a given
feedstock can be thoroughly analysed only, if at minimum, heating
rate, heat transfer in the pyrolysed material and gas retention time
are taken into consideration [125] . The first two factors determine
the feedstock decomposition, while the third determines secondary
cracking of the pyrolisates, which produces gas at the expense of
TPO. Therefore, apparently contradictory effects of temperature, in
fact, can lead to coherent conclusions. Another important issue is
the location of temperature measurement. In the case of contin-
uous processes, usually final temperature is provided, whereas in
the case of an intermittent process there is a wide-span tempera-
ture stratification.

2.3.2. Feedstock size and heating rate

While  scoping  Table  A1  it  becomes  evident  that,  due  to  the
kinetic character of the process, the size of the tyre shred influ-
ences pyrolysis efficiency, and hence TPO yield. More extensively
meshed  feed  material  (mesh  of  millimetres)  promotes  heat  en-
trainment during the process. This is especially the case when re-
actor design can take advantage of the particle size – e.g. a flu-
idised bed reactor [78] . The most suitable size of the feeding ma-

sion from Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, Elsevier.

eters, e.g. heating rate, feedstock, particle size etc. affect the TPO
yield to a large extent. The reported results are obtained on large
capacity, pilot-scale or model (laboratory-scale) installations. Addi-
tionally, liquid fractions can be condensed at various temperatures
and the yield analysis can be made on a wet or dry basis. Nev-
ertheless, the following paragraphs aim to describe the individual
parameter effects.

2.3.1. Temperature

One  of  the  most  significant  factors  affecting  pyrolysis  is  the
temperature at which the process is performed. Therefore, the ma-
jority of the research has focused on process efficiency, with tem-
perature being one of the most important parameters in this en-
deavour. From the perspective of valorisation of pyrolysis product
streams,  maximum  process  efficiency  coincides  with  maximising
the quantity and the heating value of the liquid fraction.

The existence of a distinct extremum (maximum) in TPO yield
with pyrolysis temperature was noted by many researchers, includ-
ing: Murillo et al. [89] , Rombaldo et al. [104] , D  ̃ ung et al. [108] ,
Pradhan and Singh [50] and Luo and Feng [115] . Pradhan and Singh
[50]  reported  high  TPO  yield  in  a  laboratory-scale  batch  reactor
fed with scrapped bicycle tyres in 10 mm chunks. The peak TPO
conversion (49.6%) was reported at 600 °C, a considerably higher
temperature than in the other referred works by Berrueco et al.
[51] , de Marco Rodríguez et al. [86] , Laresgoiti et al. [ 116 , 117 ] and
Aydın and   ̇Ilkılıç [118] . The temperature dependency of TPO yield
was explained, following Islam et al. [90] (originally referring to
Cunliffe and Williams [119] ), by strong cracking of tyre rubber dur-
ing second-stage reactions in the mid-temperature range (refer to
Fig. 3 ). The insensitivity of TPO yield to temperature beyond the
maximum  yield  point,  following  González  et  al.  [107]  and  Nisar
et al. [120] , can be explained with the observation that the liquid
fraction was subsequently cracked to a gaseous fraction. This was
further  attributed  to  the  rapid  extraction  of  generated  products
from the autoclave. Results presented by González et al. [107] , and
Dai et al. [79] also indicated that peak TPO yields were reached
at a certain temperature (respectively, 55.6% at 550 °C and approx-
imately 50% at 450 °C). Further increases in temperature (explored
range up to 70 0 and 80 0 °C respectively) led to a reduction in oil
fraction. This was correlated with the increase of the gaseous frac-
tion yield.

pyrolysis  (refer  to  Table  2 ).  The  gases  hinder  the  generation  of
oxides and limit the partial pressures of substrates. They also act
as carriers of volatile products of the process, while reducing the
condensation rate of aromatics and supporting carbon-black bind-
ing. Ramirez-Canon et al. [111] and Kan et al. [127] , independently
presented that better quality TPO can be obtained by the use of
hydrogen  as  an  inert  gas.  Hydrogenative  pyrolysis  stabilises  the
hydrocarbon  chains  by  hindering  the  re-polymerisation  process.
It is also proven to remove sulphur from the liquid fraction (see
Section 3.3 for details).

Excluding the synergistic effect of hydrogen which is reactive
in the conditions of pyrolysis, for other inert gases, the vapours
retention time (practically regulated by the gas flow rate) is the
dominant factor influencing yield of liquid and gaseous fractions.
Shorter retention times support high yield of liquid products; pro-
longed presence of vapours  inside the  reactor leads to  reactions
promoting gaseous products [ 79 , 80 ].

The use of a catalyst is usually designed to enhance the qual-
ity  of  a  particular  fraction.  In  general,  catalytic  pyrolysis  is  per-
formed to achieve monoaromatic compounds like benzene, toluene
or xylene [128] . On the other hand, catalysts may also reduce the
quantity of undesirable components (such as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons) in the final product. Typical catalysts are copper ni-
trate, ZSM-5 zeolite, magnesium oxide (MgO), calcium carbonate
(CaCO
3 ), ze-
3 ), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium carbonate (NaCO
olite and activated alumina. The efficiency of the catalysts depends
on the size of the pores: microporous catalysts are among those
offering the highest efficiency. Such structures are, however, more
prone to clogging by post-pyrolysis vapours, leading to deactivation
of the catalyst [ 65 , 70 , 82 , 108 , 128 ].

Williams and Brindle [65] conducted pyrolysis using Y-zeolite
(CBV-400) and ZSM-5 catalysts. While examining the effect of dif-
ferent catalyst bed temperatures (40 0-60 0 °C, at 50 °C increments)
they found the highest TPO yield (40% and 45% for each catalyst
respectively)  in  the  temperature  range  of  425-475 °C.  Further  in-
creases in temperature increased gaseous fraction production but
reduced  the  oil  fraction:  it  was  approximately  33%  at  600 °C  for
both catalysts. It is worth noting that in the cited work, pyrolysis
was also conducted without the catalyst, which actually resulted in
higher TPO yield (55.8% at 500 °C). This trend was also confirmed
by  other  researchers  [128]  and  the high-level  conclusion is  that
the increase of the temperature of a catalyst bed causes increased
production of the gaseous products, at the expense of the liquid
fraction.

2.3.4. Feedstock type

The influence of different categories of tyre feedstock has been
studied by many researchers. A handful of published comparative
analyses leads to a common conclusion that the type of feedstock
(e.g. car or truck tyre) affects TPO yield, due to differences in their
proportions of natural rubber and synthetic rubbers.

A cohesive view of this issue can be formulated when assess-
ing data from two works. Fig. 6 combines the results of Ucar et al.
[88] and Kumar Singh et al. [10] . Both studies used different cat-
egories of waste tyres at similar pyrolysis temperature ranges, but
with different reactors: fixed-bed and stirred tank respectively. In-
terestingly, both studies show consistent trends in terms of TPO
yield and feedstock categories. Independently of process conditions
and reactor type, heavy-duty tyres yielded significantly higher liq-
uid fraction compared to the light-duty tyre feedstock. The latter
yields  high  amounts  of  char.  Material  analyses  of  the  feedstock
composition  consistently  showed  that  truck  tyres  have  a  higher
content of natural rubber and a lower fraction of synthetic rub-
ber when compared to passenger car tyres. Additionally, Ucar et al.
[88] pointed out that truck tyres used SBR as a synthetic compo-
nent, whereas car tyres contained mainly BR.

Fig. 5.  The effects of temperature on liquid fraction yield. The measurement points
are adopted from [ 10 , 11 , 51 , 58 , 65 , 79 , 81 , 88 , 94 , 126 ] and fitted with quadratic func-
tions for different types of reactors. The points surrounded with circles refer to
truck tyres.

terial in terms of TPO production are shreds between 1.5 and 30
mm, while sub-millimetre particles (tyre ground) promote the pro-
duction of gaseous products [ 58 , 59 , 70 , 77 , 78 , 87 , 88 , 92 , 97 ].

Scale  of  production  is  a  significant  aspect  to  consider  when
specifying the feed material structure. Note that most of the re-
liable data on the influence of tyre meshing on pyrolysis that leads
to  the  above-mentioned  generalisation  comes  from  laboratory-
scale reactors operating intermittently. The optimal feed material
granulation  may  vary  when  scaling-up  the  reactor  size  or  shift-
ing  to  continuous  operation  [ 96 , 103 , 106 ].  Furthermore,  the  opti-
mum heating rate for TPO production will be largely dependent
on  the  fragmentation  of  the  feed  material.  Haydary  et  al.  [123] ,
using  a  screw-type  flow  reactor  performed  programmed  experi-
ments, supported by the heat transfer model, to find correlations
between heating rate and particle size. The comparison of mate-
rial  conversion  rates  for  rubber  particles  from  4  mm  to  8  mm
showed that at the pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C, the time re-
quired  for  90%  conversion  was  25  and  95  seconds,  respectively.
Mkhize  et  al.  [124]  analysed  the  effects  of  the  temperature  and
heating rate on TPO yields, using a fixed-bed, slow pyrolysis re-
actor with a nitrogen atmosphere. They established for individual
temperatures  (309,  350,  450,  550,  591 °C)  that  the  maximum  oil
fraction yield varied greatly depending on the heating rate (0.86,
5, 15, 25, 29.14 °C/min). Generally, the best results (around 45% oil
mass fraction yield) were achieved in medium ranges of tempera-
tures and heating rates. Similarly, other authors usually claim that
heating rate is a relevant control parameter yet fail to deliver clean
sweeps of heating rate undisturbed by variations of other parame-
ters. Thus, we believe currently it is impossible to draw any mean-
ingful conclusions on the effect of heating rate, so we leave this as
one of the knowledge gaps for further works to cover.

2.3.3. Inert gases and catalysts

The atmosphere (the injection of gases or vapour) is an impor-
tant variable during pyrolysis. The flow of the inert gas stabilises
and  equalises  the  temperature  inside  the  reactor.  In  the  case
of  the  fluidised-bed  reactor,  this  also  aims  to  provide  a  more
homogeneous  temperature  distribution  in  the  bed.  Nitrogen  and
helium  are  frequently  used  to  replace  atmospheric  air  during

Fig. 6.  Product distributions from pyrolysis of scrap tyres; data elaborated based on Ucar et al. [88] and Kumar Singh et al. [10] . The exact numbers can slightly differ than
presented in original research papers, because the data were converted to the dry basis.

Kumar Singh et al. [10] used TGA to study the interaction of
different  categories  of  waste  tyres  during  pyrolysis.  Higher  frac-
tions of natural rubber (predominant in heavy-duty vehicle tyres)
was reported to reduce the degradation temperature, while syn-
thetic rubber from car tyres had an opposite effect. Im portantly, a
synergistic effect was noted from interactions of both rubber frac-
tions, so solid and gaseous fraction yields were reported respec-
tively higher and lower for co-pyrolysis than predicted from indi-
vidual fractions pyrolysis data. However, the TPO yield showed a
much lower synergistic effect. More information on co-pyrolysis of
waste tyres with other materials follows in the next subsection.

2.3.5. Co-pyrolysis of tyres with other materials

As mentioned in the introduction, one particular benefit of the
pyrolysis process is its flexibility on feedstock. Some aspects of co-
pyrolysis of waste tyres with other materials deserve particular at-
tention because there seems to be an added value of material in-
teraction for improving TPO composition and yield.

Almost all available studies of co-pyrolysis focus on biomass as
the primary feedstock, and examine the large oxygenates content
of bio-oils, leading to corrosion problems, the low calorific value of
the end fuel and its instability [129] . The co-pyrolysis of biomass
and low oxygen content / high calorific value polymers provides
effective mitigation to the above issue [113] .

The publications to date in this area focus on the co-processing
of biomass and plastics: there are fewer studies of co-pyrolysis of
biomass and scrap tyres. Abnisa and Wan Daud [130] studied co-
pyrolysis of palm shells and scrap tyres, changing the process tem-
perature, time and mixing ratio. They showed that co-processing
can improve the yield and quality of crude oil while compensat-
ing for the shortages of biomass in fuel production. Farooq et al.
[131]  conducted  experiments  with  wheat  straw  and  waste  tyres
and found that, compared to oil derived from neat biomass, the
co-pyrolysis product was more stable with significantly lower alde-
hyde  content.  Chen  et  al.  [5]  were  the  first  to  explain  this  syn-
ergistic  effects  by  investigating  the  kinetics  of  biomass  (tobacco
stalk)  and  scrap  tyre  co-pyrolysis.  According  to  the  authors,  the
alkyl groups largely present amongst tyre decomposition products
can interact with carbonyl groups in tobacco stalks and lower the
CO
2 production of the pyrolysis. This increases the oil fraction yield
and lowers the energy input of the whole process.

Ultimately,  the  study  of  Chen  et  al.  [5]  is  the  only  one  that
brings forward the primary role of waste tyres in the co-pyrolysis.
Contrary to earlier mentioned studies [130] and [131] , the authors
explored  tyre/biomass  ratios  above  1:1.  They  investigated  seven
different feedstock compositions, equally distributed between the
100% tobacco stalk and 100% tyre scrap references. Importantly for
the prospect of waste tyre as feedstock, the authors reported the
greatest  synergistic  benefits  for  co-pyrolysis  (tyre/biomass)  frac-

tions of 4:6 with over 30% reduction in activation energy with re-
spect to the 100% biomass reference.

Bearing  in  mind  the  lack  of  studies  concerning  co-pyrolysis
with waste tyre as the primary feedstock and the promising ini-
tial results by Chen et al. [5] , it appears that TPO production has
still some uncharted improvement potential.

2.4. TPO production efficiency and life cycle analysis

2.4.1. TPO energy and exergy efficiency

The energy density of waste tyres is estimated at around 31.4
MJ/kg,  which  is  roughly  double  that  of  mixed  biomass  [ 40 , 132 ].
In  terms  of  energy  efficiency  it  is  sufficient  to  say  that  when
optimised for oil production, tyre pyrolysis can be self-sustainable,
with  only  around  9.5%  of  total  tyre  energy  used  to  power  the
process  and  with  only  around  2%  of  total  energy  released  to
the ambient surroundings [133] . The rest of the products can be
properly  valorised.  The  process  Sankey  diagram  ( Fig.  7 )  show-
ing  the  energy  flow  uses  averaged  heating  values  and  yields  of
the  individual  fractions,  garnered  from  the  detailed  review  in
Sections 2.3 and 2.5 . Fig. 7 is considered self-explanatory and left
without detailed comments.

More  recent  studies  related  to  TPO  production  efficiency  are
based on exergy analysis, which quantifies the process capability
to recover the energy and its losses related to irreversibility. Al-
tayeb et al. [134] calculated the exergetic efficiency of the pyroly-
sis process, based on a detail analysis of chemical exergy of sub-

11

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100915

trates and products. The overall exergetic efficiency of the rotary
kiln reactor was found to be 69.9%, which is equivalent to an ex-
ergy destruction of 30.1% due to process irreversibility. Notably, the
authors indicated there is almost no further potential for efficiency
improvement with change of reactor or process conditions.

The obtained exergy efficiency is comparable to the value com-
monly  reported  for  gasification  plants  (roughly  70%)  [135] .  For
reference,  the  exergy  efficiency  of  transesterification  to  obtain
biodiesel from different feedstock is estimated to be significantly
higher, at around 80% [136] . Note, however, that in the works re-
lated to FAME, exergy losses of methanol production are not in-
cluded, so the number does not represent the complete feedstock-
product chain as with ELTs.

2.4.2. Tyre pyrolytic plant life cycle analysis and total cost of
ownership

The mentioned work of Altayeb et al. [134] is ultimately one
of  the  few  attempting  to  cover  the  complete  life  cycle  analysis
(LCA) of TPO production. This study, based on the simulated rotary
kiln reactor adjusted for optimal TPO yield temperature ( ∼500 °C),
was made using dedicated software (SimaPro) and taking the geo-
economical  perspective  of  Saudi  Arabia.  The  system  boundaries
included  waste  tyre  transport,  shredding,  pyrolysis,  TPO  recov-
ery, distribution and end-use. The analysis also took into account
the emissions and costs related to the transport of valorised off-
streams  (steel  and  char).  The  authors  analysed  a  set  of  scenar-
ios in diversifying the feedstock-product routes and reactor pow-
ering scenarios, distinguishing over 20 environmental impact cat-
egories while diversifying the contribution of individual TPO pro-
duction stages. However, it did not perform a comparative analysis
with other TPO processing technologies. Nor did it provide any ref-
erence to other alternative fuel production processes. Crucially, it
presented results in a normalised form instead of revealing abso-
lute values of the individual outcomes. These are important short-
comings in the context of the ongoing GHG-impact discussion of
individual fuel/waste management options. Nevertheless, there is
one conclusion that is valuable to note. In the most feasible sce-
nario, where all non-condensable gases are used to power the re-
actor (as in the diagram in Fig. 7 ), the total normalised GHG impact
(CO
4 accounted) of TPO lifecycle was negligible compared
to toxic emissions. Toxic emissions in the study were divided into
several  impact  categories  related  to  air/water/terrestrial  toxicity
but all relating to CO, NO
X , PM and waste metals were combined.
The highest-emitting process here was the combustion of the non-
condensable  gases  to  power  the  reactor.  These  formed  over  70%
of the total TPO toxic emission-related impact and ultimately over
65% of the total environmental impact of TPO production. Next was
TPO end-combustion, accounting for roughly 20% and 17% impact
on toxicity and total environmental impact respectively.

2 and CH

A similar study, using similar methodology was carried from a
perspective of Thailand by Buadit et al. [137] . This uses the same
software  for  LCA  with  similar  impacts  yet  excludes  transport  of
materials and final combustion of TPO, focusing purely on the py-
rolysis process itself. This study, however, evaluates the environ-
mental impacts of waste tyre pyrolysis both with and without ac-
counting for material recovery from avoided products. Under the
second assumption, on a problem-oriented level, three impact cat-
egories - global warming, terrestrial ecotoxicity and fossil resource
scarcity - result in negative impacts. At a damage level, similar to
Altayeb et al. [134] , human health emerges as the dominant cate-
gory, resulting mainly from fine particulate matter formation from
the combustion of the gaseous fraction that powers the reactor.

As  one  can  note  from  the  above  two  paragraphs,  the  LCA
results  heavily  depend  on  the  assumptions  that  are  made  and
the  geo-socio-economical  perspective.  Thus,  the  most  relevant
arguments  for  TPO  feasibility  come  from  a  comparative  analysis

of pyrolysis with other tyre processing technologies and TPO with
other  fuel  alternatives.  We  have  not  found  any  reliable  studies
comparing  TPO  LCA  with  that  of  other  alternative  fuels.  Only
Li  et  al.  [138]  have  assessed  pyrolysis  together  with  other  ELT
treatment  technologies.  This  Chinese  case  study  is  ultimately  by
far  the  most  thorough  and  accurate  analysis  available  on  TPO
LCA. It accommodates similar system boundaries as the study of
Buadit et al. [137] , from feedstock to products, excluding transport,
and  accounts  for  material  recovery  from  avoided  products.  For
example,  350  kg  of  crude  TPO  yielding  from  10 0 0  kg  of  scrap
tyres  is  assumed  to  substitute  175  kg  of  diesel  fuel.  Under  the
same boundaries, LCA extended over economic analysis is applied
to four processes currently used in China to process waste tyres.
These  four  processes  are  ambient  grinding  (producing  crumb
rubber to be used mainly in construction); active de-vulcanisation
(currently  the  dominant  processing  technology  in  China);  py-
rolysis;  and  Illegal  oil  extraction.  The  last  process  is  analogous
to  pyrolysis  but  performed  without  proper  equipment,  emission
control and without recovering the off-gases and other substances,
which are instead illegally dumped. This illegal practice with its
high environmental impact currently handles over 14% of ELTs in
China.  The  end  results  of  the  LCA  and  environmental–economic
analysis performed by Li et al. [138] are depicted in Fig. 8 .

According to these results, pyrolysis is the best ELT processing
technology in terms of cumulative GHG reduction and second-best
in terms of fossil fuel substitution. In the second category, it is sur-
passed by devulcanization, the main route for ELTs in China. Py-
rolysis, however, does not pose the same excessive impact on hu-
man health as devulcanisation. However, it is necessary to point
out at that at the time of the study (2010), the problem of air-
borne pollution in China was regarded as more pronounced than
the impact of GHG. This was recognized by Li et al. [138] because
the weighting factor of all respiratory categories was double com-
pared to climate change. If applying the same approach with the
2 reduction, the
current constraints that attach greater value to CO
weighted eco-indicators points in Fig. 8 would further reinforce the
position of tyre pyrolysis as environmentally feasible technology.
Still, in the framework of the discussed study, according to Fig. 8 ,
pyrolysis scores best in overall environmental impact and at the
same time is considered the most economically feasible ELT man-
agement technology. Over a 10-year depreciation period, the net
benefit  of  a  new  pyrolysis  plant  in  China  (2500  tonnes/year  ca-
pacity) would be 32% higher compared to the current devulcani-
sation facility with similar capacity. Note that in this study the as-
sumed plant capacities are rather small because they are intended

for decentralised applications. The only relevant data related to the
economical feasibility of large tyre pyrolysis plants (100 tonnes/h
capacity)  come  from  1999.  This  legacy  work  of  Shelley  and  El-
Halwagi [139] assessing tyre pyrolysis plant economics in UK con-
ditions  suggested,  for  an  optimised  scenario,  a  total  investment
cost of 18 million euros, with a fairly good return of investment
rate  of  18%.  The  authors,  however,  assumed  hydrotreatment  of
crude TPO as part of the process, revalorising ready fuel compo-
nents. The cited studies are therefore not comparable, neither in
time nor socio-geographical conditions. Consequently, we consider
the current state of the art in pyrolysis economics is still uncertain.
As a final note on tyre pyrolysis economics, we must mention
that while performing this review we have come across several re-
cent publications on this topic which showed severe errors in their
principal assumptions. These include, for example, overestimating
TPO value by an order of magnitude, thus making claimed con-
clusions unfeasible. These studies were deliberately excluded from
this review in order to avoid their corrupting influence. We will
return to the bigger issue of reliability of the information on TPO
in Section 5.

2.4.3. TPO vs other fuels - remarks on the economics and GHG
footprint

In  the  light  of  the  evident  lack  of  comparative  LCA  of  TPO
with other fuel alternatives, we conclude this section with a brief,
absolute  value-based  discussion  of  selected  GHG  and  economic
factors  directly  relevant  to  the  issue  of  fuel  feasibility.  To  this
end,  Table  3  collates  available  information  about  current  market
prices of different fuel alternatives. It is not the goal of the present
work to discuss the global trends in fuel markets: the main point
from  Table  3  is  that  TPO  currently  has  the  lowest  market  price
of all available options. The price of TPO (excluding value-added
tax  or  fuel  duty)  is  comparable  with  that  of  fossil  gasoil  and  is
over 50% lower than the cheapest large–scale, straight vegetable
oil, palm oil. This, coupled with the fact that unlike all other bio
components,  TPO  ́s  price  did  not  significantly  change  during  the
past 10 years, shows there is still only minor interest in the fuel
industry  for  using  this  as  a  fuel  component  for  further  refining.
On the upside, there is potential to accommodate TPO directly as
engine  fuel  in  transport  sectors  (such  as  marine)  which  cannot
afford expensive fuels.

A comparison of the direct CO

2 footprints of different alterna-
tive fuels ( Fig. 9 ) reveals another incentive for TPO compared to

alternatives. Biodiesel values reproduced from [144] . Value of TPO calculated based

first-generation biofuels. This figure does not assume any product
valorisation of removed CO

2 due to product substitution.

Tyres  as  waste  are  commonly  counted  as  zero-CO

2  feed-
stock.  The  CO
2  emission  for  TPO  accounts  mainly  for  burning
the  non-condensable  gases  to  power  the  reactor  (including  de-
moisturisation  of  the  feedstock).  This  is  commonly  reported  for
tyre pyrolysis at a level of 68.06 (kg/tonne waste tyres) [ 137 , 145 ].
Energy consumption and so hence also the CO
2  footprint related
to ELT transport, pre-processing (grinding, mechanical separation)
and  end  product  valorisation  (extraction,  transportation  to  end-
users)  is  usually  assumed  at  a  level  of  15-19%  of  the  pyrolysis
process, depending on scenario [ 134 , 137 , 139 ]. Assuming TPO yields
reported  for  the  state-of-the-art  reactors  at  the  level  of  45-55%
(refer to Table 2 ) and lower heating values of 40 – 42 MJ/ kg (refer
to Table 6 ), the final TPO well-to-tank emissions are on average
3.76 g CO

2 e/MJ.

In the case of SVOs and FAME, assuming they are still produced
mainly from first-generation feedstock, it is large CO
2 footprint of
farming activities (mainly fertilisers) that is responsible for the vast
amount of their well-to-tank CO
2 emissions. This is not the case for
biofuels derived from waste, non-edible by-products (see Table 3 –
tallow  cat  1)  or  waste  cooking  oil.  Note  that  tallow  biodiesel,

13

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100915

however, is characterised by its large energy demand to extract oil
from fat, entailing boiling and mechanical separation [144] .

As shown in Fig. 9 , TPO production has roughly the same car-
bon footprint as oil extraction for rapeseed and soy (3.12 and 4.04
2 e/MJ respectively) and is comfortably superior to any first-
g CO
generation  FAME  or  SVO  in  the  overall  balance.  Note  that  CO
2
emissions  of  soy  and  canola  SVOs  can  be  derived  directly  from
Fig. 9 by neglecting the biodiesel combustion contribution. Further,
note that the currently most economically viable palm oil ( Table 3 )
is considered the worst in terms of CO

2 footprint [146] .

As a final point, it is apparent that the price of all the men-
tioned bio components relates to their opportunity to provide GHG
reduction. This leads to the current bizarre situation in which used
cooking oils (UCO) and their esters (UCOME) have greater market
value than their un-used originates. There is definitely a value in
the green image for fuel companies.

Having said that, we acknowledge that a detailed GHG emis-
sions life cycle analysis for both fuel categories, TPO and bio-oils,
is extremely complex and heavily dependent on geo-economic fac-
tors or even fundamental assumptions. Consequently, the results
presented in Fig. 9 should be treated as indicative. Qualitatively,
however  the  differences  are  evident,  and  in  the  context  of  the
above discussion, TPO can be considered more favourable in terms
of CO
2 footprint than all first-generation biofuels, and is ultimately
the cheapest alternative.

yield generally increases with temperature [126] . González et al.
[107] pointed out that production of hydrogen increases 10 times,
from  0.57  g/kg  of  scrap  tyre  to  5.3  g/kg,  with  the  increase  of
temperature  from  400 °C  to  700 °C.  Across  the  same  temperature
range, production of methane went from 2 g/kg to 79 g/kg. Pro-
duction of ethylene and ethane rose from 0 to 128 g/kg and 31
g/kg respectively. Production of CO and CO
2 was not differentiated
by temperature to any great extent. The increase in hydrogen and
hydrocarbons  production  at  nearly  constant  CO  and  CO
2  yield
resulted in higher gas calorific value, rising from 12 MJ/Nm 3 , (the
value of pure CO) to 42.9 MJ/Nm 3 , which is typical for natural gas.
Analysis  of  Table  4  reveals  that  different  process  parameters
provide significantly different pyrolytic gas compositions for sim-
ilar  temperatures.  This  can  be  attributed  to  different  feedstocks,
reactor  types,  processing  times  and  heating  rates. What  is  more
meaningful is that the different studies produced different trends.
For  example,  Galvagno  et  al.  [121]  observed  a  reduction  of  hy-
4 in-
drogen content with temperature, whereas the fraction of CH
creased. A similar trend in H
2 concentration for the same temper-
ature  range  was  observed  by  Berrueco  et  al.  [51] .  However,  Luo
and Feng [115] reported an increase of H
2  content with a paral-
4 . It is also worth to notice that Luo and Feng
lel decrease in CH
achieved H
2 concentrations roughly twice as high as other studies,
attributed to the use of a catalyst. This research also extended its
range of process temperatures higher than other studies.

2.5. General characterisation of pyrolysates

2.5.1. Solid fraction

The solid fraction is made up of hydrocarbons with more than
10 carbon atoms and consists of aromatics, non-aromatics and in-
gredients containing sulphur, nitrogen and oxygen [147] . Analysing
the elemental composition of solid fraction, de Marco Rodríguez
et  al.  [86]  found  that  it  was  predominantly  carbon,  accounting
for  approximately  83%  by  weight.  The  share  of  other  elements
was significantly lower. Hydrogen was 2.4%wt. at 400 °C and ap-
prox.  0.6%wt.  at  50 0,  60 0,  70 0 °C.  Nitrogen  was  approx.  0.3%wt.,
sulphur  was  approx.  2.4%wt.  Oxygen  and  others  accounted  for
approximately  1%wt.  The  cited  authors  also  found  that  the  ob-
tained pyrolytic residues were characterised by the concentration
of ash (from 9.0 to 13.2%wt.), far higher than for commercial car-
bon black, which has an admissible concentration of no more than
0.5%wt. The ash in the pyrolytic residues comes from the original
tyre inorganic fillers. López et al.  [148] presented that tyre rub-
2 O (8.6%wt.),
ber ashes consisted of SiO
5 ,
CaO (4.6%wt.), Al

K

2 were between 0.4%wt. and 0.9%wt.

The  solid  fraction  obtained  by  tyre  pyrolysis  can  be  used  as
a solid fuel [149] , a carbon black for rubber manufacturing [86] ,
a filler in road bitumen [150–152] or an adsorbent material. For
the latter application, however, the carbon residue requires activa-
tion, which may be accomplished by either physical or chemical
methods  [ 9 , 153–155 ].  Physical  activation  is  conducted  by  partial
gasification using steam or CO
2 as activating agents [ 153 , 154 , 156 ].
Chemical activation entails treating the char with nitric acid, hy-
drogen peroxide, ammonium persulfate or impregnated by potas-
sium hydroxide and phosphoric acid: these act as a dehydrated ac-
tivating agent [ 9 , 155 ].

hensive review of gas fraction composition for different pyrolysis
temperatures. Note that the various studies use different feedstock
or  types  of  reactors.  At  this  point,  it  is  worth  noting  that  gas

Dai et al. [79] systematically analysed the effects of temperature
and residence time on the composition of pyrolytic gas. The tests
were  realised  in  a  temperature  range  from  350 °C  to  800 °C.  For
the  given  temperature  range,  the  fraction  of  hydrogen  increased
monotonically from 1% to 15% and the fraction of CH
4  increased
from  7%  to  40%.  The  fraction  of  CO  increased  with  temperature
2 decreased from 8% to
from 1% to 7%, whereas the fraction of CO

found to be higher than that of saturated, which was attributed
to double carbon bonds within the rubber molecules. Additionally,
the rise in temperature increased ethylene concentration and de-
creased ethane concentration, in the same range for both compo-
nents. Analysing the effects of residence time, it was found that,
at 600 °C, an increase of residence time from one second to five
seconds increased the content of H

This sensitivity to residence time was attributed to secondary re-
actions, including char reduction, tar cracking and shift reaction.
Similarly, Leung et al. [126] noticed that concentrations of hydro-
gen, methane and ethylene increase with residence time, followed
by the reduction of heavier hydrocarbons.

It should be emphasised that the obtained gaseous fraction is
characterised by a good calorific value ( Table 4 ). Theoretically, af-
ter desulphurisation, it could be used for combustion engine ap-
plications, especially as a complement to natural gas or liquefied
petroleum gas in a gas network, providing large- scale availabil-
ity and infrastructure compatibility. It is customary for the gaseous
fraction to provide internal heat for the pyrolysis process itself. The
pyrolytic  off-gas  may  cover  the  full  energy  needs  of  a  pyrolysis
plant optimised for liquid yield [9] . Bearing that in mind, combus-
tion engine applications for pyrolytic gases will not be considered
further in this work.

2.5.3. Liquid fraction (tyre pyrolysis oil – TPO)

The oil fraction obtained as a result of tyre pyrolysis (TPO) is
20  and is generally
composed of hydrocarbons between C
a mixture of alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes and aro-
matic compounds [ 80 , 89 , 103 , 107 , 108 , 115 , 147 ]. The exact composi-
tion depends on the type of feedstock and parameters of the pro-
cess. Fig. 10 compares liquid composition and is compiled from dif-
ferent studies (non-catalytic pyrolysis only). It can be noted that

Fig. 10.  Composition of TPO from different reactors at variable temperatures. Data from de Marco Rodríguez et al. [86] , Ucar et al. [88] , D  ̨ebek and Walendziewski [74] and
Alvarez et al. [58] . Two-colour filling for the first five bars indicates aliphatic hydrocarbons cumulatively.

substantially different TPO compositions can be obtained, depend-
ing  upon  the  reactor  type,  conditions  and  feedstock.  It  is  also
evident  that  the  effect  of  temperature  depends  on  reactor  type.
As  a side note,  the  list of  identified species and their classifica-
tion into particular hydrocarbon groups can differ from study to
study.

D  ̨ebek and Walendziewski [ 74 , 159 ] performed pyrolysis at the
relatively low temperature of 400 °C. The TPO produced, on a mass
basis, consisted of approximately 11.9% alkanes, 7.7% dienes, 4.5%
cycloalkanes, 3.7% cycloalkenes and 47.4% aromatic hydrocarbons.
Arabiourrutia et al. [147] found that raising the pyrolysis tempera-
ture from 425 °C to 610 °C increased the share of aromatics almost
three-fold. The aromatics content (unfavourable for engine appli-
cations  due  to  their  contribution  to  in-cylinder  soot  production)
reached 16.44% of the total TPO mass at the highest pyrolysis tem-
perature. But even that was three times less than aromatics con-
tent  obtained  by  D  ̨ebek  [159] .  Simultaneously,  the  non-aromatic
compounds  (C
10 )  decreased  from  30.48%wt.  at  425 °C  to
23.7%wt. at 610 °C. This increase in aromatics was associated with
a reduction in liquid fraction yield, which was mainly due to the
reduction in C
10  lump. Furthermore, the cited authors noted that
the predominant aromatic compounds presented in the TPO frac-
tion obtained at 425 °C were 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethnyl)-benzene,
1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-benzene,  1,2,3-trimethyl-benzene,  1-

5  – C

methylethenyl-benzene and styrene. These all had concentrations
above 0.5%wt.

Ucar et al. [88] compared the composition of TPO derived from
passenger  car  and  truck  tyres,  processed  under  identical  condi-
tions. They found that the TPO profile from cars is shaped in the
following order: paraffins < aromatics < olefins. The TPO profile
from  heavy-duty  truck  tyres  showed:  paraffins  <  olefins  <  aro-
matics. These effects were attributed to different rubber compo-
sition.  The  higher  content  of  natural  rubber  used  in  truck  tyres
produced  more  paraffinic  hydrocarbons,  whereas  synthetic  rub-
ber present as the main component of car tyres produced more
aromatics  [ 10 , 88 ].  Interestingly,  increasing  the  pyrolysis  temper-
ature  did  not  affect  the  share  of  the  individual  types  of  com-
pounds.  The  same  conclusion  was  drawn  by  Murillo  et  al.  [89] ,
who  carried  out  pyrolysis  at  400 °C,  500 °C  and  600 °C.  They
found that the share of aromatic compounds was approximately
73%, with the saturated ones amongst them being approximately
6-7%  and  polar  aromatics  contributing  20%  at  all  temperature
conditions.

Research by de Marco Rodríguez et al. [86] , on the other hand,
proved a strong thermal dependency for TPO composition. Simi-
lar findings were later mentioned by Arabiourrutia et al. [147] and
Choi et al. [59] . The original study by de Marco Rodríguez et al.
[86] observed that the share of aromatic compounds gradually in-

creased from 34.7% at 300 °C to 75.6% at 600 °C. Further elevating
the  pyrolysis  temperature  to  700 °C  reduced  aromatic  content  to
57.4%. The inverse trend was noticed for aliphatic compounds [59] .
The authors, conducting single-stage pyrolysis with an atmosphere
of product gas at 497 °C and 614 °C; and with nitrogen gas at 516 °C
and  617 °C,  also  noted  an  inverse  correlation  between  aromatics
and  aliphatic  compounds.  Conversion  of  aliphatic  compounds  to
aromatics resulted from the secondary atomisation reaction, with
the Dies-Alder mechanism and condensation occurring at higher
temperatures [ 102 , 119 , 160 ].

De Marco Rodríguez et al. [86] stated that the correlation be-
tween aromatics and aliphatics is related to the recombination re-
action among free radicals of these compounds. Choi et al. [ 59 , 112 ]
observed that the dominant compounds of aromatic fraction, in-
dependent  of  the  pyrolysis  parameters,  were  xylenes,  while  DL-
limonene was the main aliphatic compound. Notably, these obser-
vations were irrespective of the process conditions, reactor type or
fluidised-bed material.

Among  other  aromatics,  PAHs  pose  a  challenge  because  they
are  not  only  highly  toxic  as  an  exhaust  gas  compound  but  also
enhance soot formation. Aromatisation of aliphatic compounds to
PAHs is supported by high temperatures and residence time. Cun-
liffe and Williams [161] , using a fixed-bed reactor, observed an in-
crease of the PAH content from 1.5%wt. to 3.4%wt. when shifting
temperature from 450 °C to 600 °C. Alvarez et al. [58] , using a con-
ical spouted-bed reactor, produced PAH fractions lower than 5%wt
at temperatures of 475 °C and lower. Elevating the temperature to
575 °C  increased  the  polyaromatic  content  to  12.6%wt.  However,
some studies reported higher PAH concentrations, even in lower

temperatures. For example Li et al. [162] produced 8.6%wt. PAHs at
450 °C and 13.1%wt. at 500 °C in a rotary-kiln reactor. Interestingly,
further temperature rise did not increase PAHs production.

Table 5 summarises the elemental composition of different TPO
samples reported by individual authors and compares it the com-
position of DF and the most popular biodiesel (FAME). The pyroly-
sis process temperature is also given.

Analysis of Table 5 ’s summary of the TPO compositions shows
two tendencies are emerging. Luo and Feng [115] found that pyrol-
ysis temperature significantly affected the profile of individual el-
ements: raising the temperature significantly increased the shares
of C and N, while the H share gradually decreased. In contrast, de
Marco Rodríguez et al. [86] , Galvagno et al. [121] and Aylón et al.
[98] did not observe significant changes in the elemental composi-
tion of TPO with temperature.

The  quality  of  crude  pyrolytic  oil  obtained  from  waste  tyres
makes it generally suitable for use as fuel in a CI engine. TPO’s
heating value of approximately 43 MJ/kg is close to those of other
engine fuels, such as diesel (43.3 MJ/kg), methane (50 MJ/kg), gaso-
line (44.4 MJ/kg) and biodiesel (36.8 MJ/kg) [ 165 , 166 ]. It also has
similar  molecular  composition  [ 86 , 103 , 115 , 163 , 164 , 167–171 ].  The
mass-based hydrogen to carbon ratio (affecting tank-to-wheel CO
2
emissions) for crude TPO averages 0.128, similar to that of refined
diesel oil.

TPO’s properties relevant to its use in a combustion engine are
discussed  in  detail  in  the  following  section.  One  should  bear  in
mind that TPO’s composition, and hence its related combustion pa-
rameters, depends on reactor type, inert gas used, process temper-
ature, quality of feedstock and their pre-treatment. Subsequent re-

fining used as a post-treatment will also have a bearing on TPO  ́s
combustion parameters.

3. Pyrolytic oil as engine fuel

Already in the early 1980s, it was found that pyrolytic oil sam-
ples and condensates produced by petroleum residues coking (by
thermal  and  steam  cracking  of  gasoil  fraction  and  gasoline)  are
similar  to  olefins  [103] .  For  this  reason,  these  products  can  be
blended  and  thermally  treated  under  the  same  conditions.  Fur-
thermore,  Miandad  et  al.  [73]  suggested  that  TPO  generated  by
catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis consisted mainly of aromatics
with some aliphatic compounds, which have similar physical prop-
erties as conventional diesel fuel.

As  discussed  in  the  introduction,  this  review  focuses  on  CI
engine applications because these are the most feasible from the
future  demand  perspective.  TPO  samples  should  be  evaluated
against legal and functional requirements in order to verify if TPO
is suitable as fuel for CI engines. Important properties, among oth-
ers, are kinematic viscosity, density, acidity, water content, sulphur
content,  flash  point,  distillation  curve  and  cetane  number.  The
following  chapters  review  TPO’s  engine-relevant  properties  and
possible quality improvement measures. Table 6 summarises the
results of the assessment of TPO as a CI-engine fuel. Automotive
diesel EN 590 standard is used as a reference in this table and in
the discussion.

3.1. Properties of crude TPO

Heating value (or calorific value) is one of the most important
indicators for fuel as it translates to the vehicle/vessel range and
2 assessment and the fuel
is a key factor in the well-to-wheel CO
cost of transport. It should be noted here that mass-based heat-
ing value of hydrocarbon fuels is straightforwardly shaped by the
ratio of hydrogen to carbon and the presence of oxygen and nitro-
gen. In the case of biofuels and also TPO, water content can signif-
icantly harm calorific value. Heating values for the TPO samples in
Table 6 are depicted in one of three forms: higher and lower heat-
ing value (HHV and LHV respectively) or as gross calorific value
(GCV).  This  is  because  the  individual  study  authors  did  not  all
adopt  the  same  measurement  principle.  The  difference  between
the three approaches relates to how water and ash content is han-
dled in the calculation. For further elaboration of this, refer, for in-
stance, to Heywood [188] .

The  energy  density  of  crude  TPO  can  be  optimised  to  give
diesel-like  values,  with  LHV  ranging  from  38.9  to  42.5  MJ/kg
[ 115 , 179 , 180 ]. Reported values of GCV usually range from 41.6 to
44.8 MJ/kg [ 88 , 90 , 103 , 174 , 175 , 177 , 183 ]. Some studies, with calorific
values ranging from 39.2 to 48.7 MJ/kg, fail to specify the method
used for its determination [ 72 , 106 , 111 , 178 , 184 , 187 ]. This spread of
values stems from differences in feedstock quality and different py-
rolysis process parameters. Studying Table 6 reveals that there is
no straightforward correlation between heating value and process
temperature. For instance, Luo and Feng [115] observed that both
parameters  increase  simultaneously,  while  Ramirez-Canon  et  al.
[111] observed a significant drop in HHV after elevating the process
temperature above 600 °C. More detailed analysis, however, reveals
the direct correlation of heating value with TPO yield. Importantly,
there is no trade-off here: maximising yield also results in a higher
energy density of the end fuel. As with the case of mass fraction
yield, catalytic pyrolysis tends to produce more energetic fuel [72] .
Note that, according to Ramirez-Canon et al. [111] , the increase of
mass fraction yield translates to higher heating value by virtue of
increased density of the TPO sample. The increased density was
observed  and  ranged from  830  to  987  kg/m 3  at  15 °C,  the  latter
value significantly beyond that of EN 590 diesel.

Most  of  the  kinematic  viscosity  values  for  TPO  (measured
at  40 °C)  were  in  accordance  with  EN  590  ́s  permissible  range
for  diesel  fuels,  2.0-4.5  mm 2 /s  [ 17 , 71 , 72 , 88 , 106 , 115 , 173 , 176 , 178–
182 , 184 ]. However, Ramirez-Canon et al. [111] and Miandad et al.
[73]  both  reported  low  viscosities  -  below  1.90  mm 2 /s.  On  the
other  hand,  Islam  et  al.  [175] ,  Sebola  et  al.  [177] ,  Islam  and
Nahian [183] , Bhatt and Prajapati [186] , Hürdo  ̆gan et al. [187] and
Ambrosewicz-Walacik  et  al.  [39]  obtained  highly  viscous  TPO,
well  above  the  level  for  proper  operation  of  most  fuel  injection
systems. Roy et al. [103] for instance, recorded kinematic viscosity
(at  50 °C)  of  23.5  mm 2 /s  for  his  TPO  obtained  from  passenger
car tyres filled with silica (fixed-bed reactor). It should be noted
that  viscosity  depends  heavily  on  temperature,  with  hyperbolic
characteristics differing from fuel to fuel. For the discussed sample
the viscosity at 100 °C was 5.2 mm 2 /s. Its potential direct engine
application, for marine use, for instance, would require preheating
to around 120 °C.

Water  and  sulphur  concentrations  in  crude  TPO  are  usu-
ally  above  the  levels  specified  as  maxima  for  EN  590  diesel
(water,  200  mg/kg;  sulphur,  10  mg/kg).  According  to  the  avail-
able  data,  water  contents  varied  between  zero  and  46  g/kg
[ 93 , 115 ].  Turning  to  sulphur  content,  all  the  samples  presented
in  Table  6  significantly  exceeded  the  sulphur  limit  for  EN  590
diesel.  Values  ranged  from  88  mg/kg  to  15  g/kg  [ 17 , 39 , 71–
73 , 93 , 103 , 111 , 173 , 174 , 176 , 177 , 179 , 180 , 182 , 186 ].
Desulphurisation
methods are discussed in Section 3.3 .

The  flash  point  is  the  lowest  temperature  at  which  a  liq-
uid can form an ignitable mixture with air, when the surface of
the  liquid  is  exposed  to  an  ignition  source.  It  is  related  to  the
volatility  of  the  fuel,  and  is  therefore  set  by  distillation  param-
eters.  The  EN  590  standard  regulates  the  flash  point  of  diesel
to  be  at  least  55 °C,  enabling  safe  storage  and  handling.  How-
ever, most research determines TPO’s flash point to be less than
30 °C  [ 71 , 73 , 88 , 103 , 175 , 180–182 ].  Some  put  it  higher,  from  31 °C
to  54 °C  [ 17 , 39 , 72 , 111 , 173 , 174 , 183–186 ].  Only  a  few  studies  as-
sessed  TPO’s  flash  point  to  be  in  accordance  with  the  require-
ments of the EN 590 standard, reporting values from 58 °C to 94 °C
[ 103 , 106 , 159 , 177–179 ].

One of the most important fuel characteristics is the distillation
curve, which can explain the trends in several parameters already
discussed:  flash  point,  volatility  and  low-temperature  properties.
Fig. 11 shows distillation curves of TPO produced at different reac-
tor temperatures, determined by Alvarez et al. [58] . For reference,
gasoline, diesel and vacuum gas oil distillation curves are included
in Fig. 11 . Note, however, that the distillation curve of TPO is sim-
ulated – based on the detailed chemical analysis. Fig. 12 shows ex-
perimental distillation curves determined by de Marco Rodríguez
et al. [86] and Yazdani et al. [11] .

The  distillation  range  of  TPOs  in  Fig.  11  shows  that  pyrolytic
oils consist of a wide variety of chemical products with different
boiling points. The exception to this is case 6, which was pyrol-
ysed at the highest temperature (575 °C) and which shows a rela-
tively flat distribution, consisting mostly of fractions with a boiling
point around 160 °C. The other curves show that the gasoline frac-
tion of TPO, also called light naphtha fraction, with boiling temper-
atures < 160 °C, varies from 14% to 42%. The heavy naphtha fraction
(160-200 °C) reported by Yazdani et al. [11] for pyrolysis tempera-
ture 500 °C was only 4%, whereas from Fig. 11 it can be read that
at the process temperature 575 °C this fraction constitutes approx-
imately 70% of the TPO. The middle distillate fraction (from 200 °C
to 350 °C) is reported to be between 35% and 38%, and the heavy
oil fraction ( > 350 °C) ranges from 1% to 47% [ 11 , 58 , 86 ]. Generally,
a wider distillation temperature range than for DF inhibits the low-
temperature  properties  of  TPO,  at  the  same  time  causing  issues
related to low flash-point. The low-temperature issues come from
large fractions of heavy components. While typically 95% of diesel

Such  values  indicate  that  compression  ignition  in  typical  engine
conditions is still possible, but with significant ignition delay. How-
ever, lower CN does not preclude TPO use in other engine applica-
tions, such as off-road or marine (see Table 1 for reference). One
should note that the cetane number is shaped by chemical compo-
sition of hydrocarbons. Generally, normal paraffinic hydrocarbons
exhibit the best auto-ignition properties, whereas branched paraf-
fins, olefins and aromatics reduce the cetane number. Additionally,
a greater number of C atoms leads to better auto-ignition proper-
ties, but carries the penalty of higher viscosity [ 188 , 189 ].

Another  obstacle  to  TPO  ́s  application  is  its  acidity,  which  af-
fects corrosive activity and propensity to create deposits. Acidity
usually does not pose a challenge for mineral DF, while for biofu-
els it is an issue, mainly due to some content of carboxylic acids.
Both European and US standards (EN 14214 and ASTM D6751) limit
acid value of biofuels to 0.5 mg KOH/g. TPO also contains some
amounts of carboxylic acids and additionally can contain sulphuric
acids.  However,  different  research  provides  very  different  acidity
levels. Ambrosewicz-Walacik et al. [39] determined acidity to be
4.33 mg KOH/g. Antoniou and Zorpas [190] reported a much lower
value of 0.45 mg KOH/g. Raj et al. [81] demonstrated diesel-like
acidity (0.1-0.21 mg KOH/g). Alvarez et al. [58] and Yazdani et al.
[11] , independently indicated that the content of carboxylic acids
in TPO drops with increasing pyrolysis temperature. However, com-
parison of other studies’ acid values and process temperatures do
not support this statement. These discrepancies suggest that acid-
ity of TPO is affected by many factors, not yet sufficiently studied
in the literature.

Finally,  long-term  storage  capabilities  are  an  important  con-
sideration  for  new  fuels  or  their  components.  Storage  capabili-
ties of fuels are affected mainly by oxidation, thermal or thermal-
oxidative  decomposition,  hydrolysis  or  microbial  contamination
from dust or water [JH003]. Oxidative stability is one of the pri-
mary concerns, but high water-content in TPO might also involve
issues of hydrolysis and microbial growth. Nevertheless, available
reports  mention  satisfactory  storage  capabilities  of  TPO.  Alvarez
et al. [58] stated that TPO properties remain unchanged with time.
More quantitatively, Ambrosewicz-Walacik et al. [185] determined
oxidative stability of the TPO distillate (EN 14112 method), to be
above 20 hours – a value considered sufficient for EN 590. Sharma
and Murugan [17] pointed out that TPO  contains some phenolic
compounds,  which  may  act  as  antioxidants.  They  observed  that
20% TPO admixture in biofuel – jatropha methyl ester (JME) - im-
proved oxidation stability approximately 2.5 times. Moreover, the
stability effect of TPO admixture was greater than that of DF. Ac-
cording to the above remarks, TPO seems to support oxidative sta-
bility of biofuels when blends are considered.

3.2. Properties of TPO distillates (DTPO)

Distillation  is  one  of  the  main  methods  to  improve  TPO  fuel
quality, with different fractions being more suitable for different
applications,  either  as  fuel  or  as  a  fuel  additive.  The  distillation
curves of TPOs (see previous subsection for reference) show that
pyrolytic oils consist of wide variety of chemical products with dif-
ferent boiling points. Literature specifying the properties of differ-
ent TPO fractions is, however, limited. Where available, properties
of  TPO  distillates  are  included  in  Table  6 ,  providing  comparison
with the properties of crude TPO obtained via the same pyrolysis
process.

The recent work by Ambrosewicz-Walacik et al.  [39] outlines
the systematic fractionation of TPO, along with an assessment of
the physicochemical properties of the fractions obtained. Three lev-
els of distillation were considered: A) Light Fraction: consisting of
components with boiling temperature < 160 °C. This fraction was
distilled in order to separate components with high volatility, sig-

fuel distillates below 340 °C, this characteristic temperature for TPO
can be as high as 500 °C. The low flash point (flammability) issue
relates to some fraction of gasoline-like components with low boil-
ing temperatures.

The distillation curves of crude TPO suggest that both the flash
point  and  low-temperature  properties  could  be  improved  if  nar-
rower fractions are isolated by further distillation. The properties
of distilled TPO are presented in the next subsection.

Cetane  number  (CN)  is  of  great  importance  because  it  deter-
mines the fuel’s ability to auto-ignite under CI engine conditions.
The EN 590 standard for automotive-grade fuels specifies a min-
imum  cetane  number  of  51,  whereas  values  for  crude  TPO  are
rather  lower,  ranging  from  25  to  48  [ 17 , 72 , 103 , 106 , 176 , 184 , 186 ].

nificantly  influencing  the  low  flash  point  of  the  pyrolytic  oil.  B)
Medium Fraction: boiling temperature from 160 °C to 204 °C. This
fraction was considered as a diesel fuel component and subjected
to further engine tests in [39] . C) Heavy Fraction: components with
boiling temperature from 205 °C to 350 °C. Note that at over 350 °C,
only a tar-like substance remained in the distillation flask. As well
as  the  physicochemical  comparison  given  in  Table  6 ,  the  differ-
ences in the appearance of crude TPO and its distillates are seen
in Fig. 13 . It clearly shows that the added value of distillation is
the reduction of ash and tar content in the fuel [39] .

It was shown that the distillation process dramatically reduced
kinematic  viscosity  (to  below  0.9  mm 2 /s  for  all  samples)  while
also contributing to the unfavourable decrease of the flash point
( Table 6 ). The flash point for the light fraction was below 3.5 °C;
it was 12 °C and 25 °C for the medium and heavy fractions respec-
tively. The crude TPO’s flash point was 53 °C, almost meeting EN
590’s threshold value of 55 °C for diesel.

Other  authors  had  studied  only  selected  distillates,  usually
medium and light fractions, but the above trends were confirmed
by  Al  Mamun  et  al.  [93] ,  Islam  and  Nahian  [183]  and  Murugan
et al. [174] . Describing what they called a light TPO fraction, Tudu
et al. [181] reported viscosity of 3.06 mm 2 /s (within EN 590’s per-
mitted range) and a moderate flash point of 30 °C.

Murugan et al. [174] , Sebola et al. [177] and Islam and Nahian
[183] recorded that the distillation process contributed to the in-
crease in calorific value of analysed samples. Their medium frac-
tions had respectively 2.8 MJ/kg, 0.7 MJ/kg and 1.6MJ/k higher en-
ergy density than their individual crude TPO samples. At the same
time, it is difficult to assess how distillation affects CN. Actually,
only Tudu et al. [181] reported that their fractionated light DTPO
product had a CN of 25-30 (depending on the pyrolysis tempera-
ture) while having a more or less constant calorific value of 39.2
MJ/kg. However, that work lacks any comparison with the crude
TPO. Its authors also reported the light fraction’s very high sen-
sitivity to sulphur penetration, depending upon pyrolysis process
temperature. Its sulphur content varied from 1.2% to above 3%wt.
From  Ambrosewicz-Walacik  et  al.  [185]  we  can  deduce  that  the
sulphur  content  of  fractions  follows  the  same  trend  as  density.
The light fractions accumulated less sulphur than the baseline TPO
(0.40%wt.  vs  0.49%wt.),  while  having  significantly  lower  density
than crude TPO (770 kg/m 3  vs 955 kg/m 3 ). The medium fraction
already had both indicators slightly above baseline TPO. The heavi-
est fraction had a density of 1360 kg/m 3 and sulphur concentration
of 0.85%wt.

3.3. Quality improvement measures for TPO/DTPO

Section 3.1’s and 3.2’s review of TPO/DTPO parameters related
to use as fuel in a CI engine reveals a large spread in the results
obtained in different reactors. Nevertheless, it is clear that most of
TPO’s physicochemical parameters did not meet the EN 590 stan-
dard. In the case of a few determinants, depending on pyrolysis
methods, nor did TPO comply with other standards. For example,

it did not meet ISO 8217 for bunker fuel quality. Sulphur content
and moisture levels of the TPO fuel present the biggest issues. At
this point, it is necessary to mention that, in principle, TPO can
be  used  as  feedstock  to  standard  refinery  processes  to  produce
automotive-grade diesel and other fuels. However, this route has
not been demonstrated openly and consequently will not be cov-
ered in this review.

Moisture removal does not pose a particular challenge and can
be  achieved  with  a  variety  of  well-established  methods  which
are standard for many alternative fuel components. These meth-
ods  involve  mechanical  separation  (centrifugation),  physical  pro-
cesses (percolation through a bed of anhydrous substance such as
sodium sulphate, vacuum drying) or thermal processing (distilla-
tion) [ 47 , 174 , 181 ]. There are also chemical methods based on sup-
plementation  with  additives  exhibiting  water-binding  properties
[191] .  As  mentioned,  these  methods  are  commonplace  and  thus
will not be separately discussed. Moisture removal helps increase
the heating value and improve the CN of the fuel and is important
from the perspective of preventing engine corrosion and tribologi-
cal issues [106] .

Sulphur content of liquid engine fuels has been drastically re-
duced  in  the  past  few  decades,  cutting  the  sulphur  compounds
in exhaust emissions. These are environmentally harmful, mainly
because  of  their  potential  to  cause  acid  rain.  Furthermore,  fuel
sulphur increases particulate matter and soot emissions in inter-
nal combustion engines [192] . There are also technical reasons for
cutting fuel sulphur: sulphur causes corrosion and has a delete-
rious effect on advanced catalytic systems used for CO, HC, NOx
and  particulate  reduction  [ 193 , 194 ].  This  underlines  the  impor-
tance of desulphurisation for TPO, especially bearing in mind the
possible direct use of TPO in shipping, where IMO has introduced
0.5/0.1%wt.  fuel  sulphur  limits.  The  automotive  EN  590  standard
is already very stringent, limiting fuel sulphur content to just 10
mg/kg (0.001%wt.).

The  sulphur  in  pyrolytic  oil  is  related  to  the  fact  that  this
compound is used as a cross-linking agent during tyre manufac-
turing. Sulphur-containing compounds undergo different reactions
(recombination and/or disproportionation) during pyrolysis. As dis-
cussed  in  Sections  3.1  and  3.2 ,  TPO/DTPO  may  contain  different
amounts of sulphur, depending on the process conditions and dis-
tillation temperature.

2 O

A  conventional  refinery  hydrodesulphurisation  (HDS)  process
can  be  used  to  reduce  sulphur  content  in  fuel,  yet  its  appli-
cation  is  primarily  limited  to  distillates  (light  to  medium  frac-
tions)  [195] .  D  ̨ebek  and  Walendziewski  [74]  applied  hydrotreat-
3  catalyst (a standard refinery configura-
ment with a NiMo–Al
tion for petroleum-based products), cutting sulphur content from
1.1% to 0.2%. Additionally, double carbon bonds were effectively de-
stroyed. This required quite strict hydro-refining conditions, using
360 °C and 5 MPa H
2 pressure. Hita et al. [ 196 , 197 ] also performed
HDS with a NiMo catalyst, while trying six different porous sup-
3 , as in the
ports, including a conventional composition with -Al
previously referred study. The authors selected –Al

2 –Al

and a mesoporous material referred to as MCM-41 as the most ac-
tive catalytic supports. All of them provided roughly equal sulphur
removal potential of around 90% for TPO samples with 2% and 1%
sulphur content, leaving 0.2% and 0.1% sulphur respectively in the
end samples. The differences were observed in H
2 uptake and fi-
nal fuel composition. The SiO
3 -based catalyst provided the
2 –Al
highest yield of diesel (57%wt.) and naphtha (25%wt.), while the
3  setup  gave  the  highest  fuel  quality,  charac-
conventional  –Al
terised by an increased paraffinic fraction and improved CN. The
latter was as much as five points higher than the base TPO.

The above numbers indicate that state-of-the-art HDS has po-
tential  to  reduce  the  sulphur  content  of  crude  TPO  to  the  level
of  0.1%,  independently  of  the  base  sample  ́s  sulphur  content.  It

21

should  be  noted  that  high  consumption  of  hydrogen,  expensive
molybdenum  catalysts  and  low  stability  of  the  support  materi-
als deemed effective for TPO HDS are considered as disadvantages
of this method [ 195 , 197 ]. Refining processes that remove sulphur
from the fuel also simultaneously reduce the fuel’s lubricity.

Another popular desulphurisation method uses oxidation of the
sulphur compounds, either by methanol extraction or silica gel col-
umn  adsorption  of  the  more  polar,  oxidized  sulphur  compounds
from methanol. Al-Lal et al. [182] used both methods on TPO pro-
vided by a third party, yet failed to lower the sulphur content to a
significant degree.

There  were  a  couple  of  successful  attempts  to  reduce  TPO’s
sulphur by optimising the pyrolysis process itself, either by ded-
icated  reactor  conditioning  or  by  adding  catalysts.  Analysis  of
Table  4  shows  that  the  application  of  catalysts  during  pyrolysis
could be effective in lowering TPO’s sulphur content. Banihani and
Bani Hani [72] employed this technique to cut sulphur in pyrolytic
oil by around 70%. The sulphur content of 1.13% in their TPO with
baseline  tyre  pyrolysis  without  a  catalyst  was  cut  to  0.37%  and
0.34% when alumina and zeolite catalysts respectively were added
to the process. Importantly, in both catalytic cases, the reduction in
sulphur was accompanied by improvement of all the other proper-
ties of the TPO (refer to Table 6 for details).

Note that already in 20 0 0 Murena [198] considered using hy-
drogenative  pyrolysis  to  reduce  TPO’s  sulphur  content.  Coupled
with optimising the feedstock pre-treatment (tyre scrap versus tyre
powder), the author observed that the use of tetralin as a hydro-
gen donor could cut sulphur by 30%. However, the tyre/tetralin ra-
tio used to achieve this degree of sulphur reduction was over 1:3,
so the large amount of hydrogen donor solvent required could sig-
nificantly influence the economics of tyre pyrolysis rendering this
method uncompetitive.

Choi et al. [ 59 , 112 ] tackled sulphur reduction by using differ-
ent  reactor  conditions  and  reactor  addification.  They  concluded
that,  independent  of  the  pyrolysis  process  (single-stage  or  two-
stage)  and  type  of  inert  gas  (product  gases  or  N
2 ),  raising  py-
rolysis temperature generally increases the sulphur content, with
different sensitivities for individual pyrolysis types [59] . Using N
2
as the fluidising medium with two-stage pyrolysis generally facil-
itated the lowest sulphur in crude TPO. Sulphur accumulation de-
creased from 0.92%wt. at baseline conditions (single-stage; prod-
uct gases; temperature optimised for liquid yield), to 0.55% at op-
timised operation (sulphur content co-optimised with temperature
for maximum TPO yield and heating value). In the follow-up work,
Choi et al. started from the previously optimised pyrolytic reactor
and experimented with different process additives (dolomite and
olivine, both natural and calcined) in search of a further reduction
in the TPO’s sulphur [112] . The TPO sample produced with natu-
ral and calcined olivine contained low amounts of sulphur (0.46
and  0.45%wt.  respectively).  Interestingly,  the  addition  of  natural
dolomite increased sulphur to 0.70%wt., while calcine dolomite had
no significant effect.

Aydın  and   ̇Ilkılıç [118]  investigated  the  effect  of  adding  CaO
and Ca(OH)
2 as sulphur-mitigating agents to a pyrolytic reactor fed
with tyre  scraps.  After  optimising the  amount  and  ratio  of  both
compounds the authors demonstrated a reduction in sulphur con-
tent from 1.4%wt. to 0.9%wt., without significantly impacting other
TPO  parameters.  Additional  post-pyrolysis  desulphurisation  with
sulphuric acid (10% aqueous solution) cut the sulphur content to
0.2% wt.

This latter post-treatment method is commonly referred to as
desulphurisation through ionic solutions or liquid-liquid extraction.
Ahmad et al. [199] analysed the impact of various desulphurising
ionic agents on TPO, using sulphuric acid; a combination of hydro-
gen peroxide and acetic acid; Fuller’s earth; and calcium oxide. A
15%wt. solution of sulphuric acid as the extracting medium gave

the maximum sulphur reduction, cutting the TPO’s sulphur con-
tent from the baseline approximately 1%wt. to 0.63%wt. Interest-
ingly, calcium oxide showed only a marginal desulfurisation abil-
ity although the cited authors did refer to the already mentioned
successful result by Aydın and  ̇Ilkılıç [118] . Ahmad et al. supposed
that using calcium oxide at higher temperatures would give a big-
ger sulphur reduction [199] . They also found that the viscosity of
tyre pyrolysis oil fell significantly with increasing addition of sul-
phuric  acid  and  the  hydrogen  peroxide/acetic  acid  combination.
Viscosity was not similarly affected by the addition of calcium ox-
ide,  however.  Also  evaluating  ionic  solutions,  Koc  and  Abdullah
[200]  started  desulphurisation by  preparing  a  binary  solution  of
tetraoctylammonium bromide and hydrogen peroxide (30% purity),
to which a phosphotungstic acid catalyst was added. The presented
solution cut the sulphur content in the TPO sample from 0.768%wt.
to 0.321%wt.

In summary, recent years have brought significant progress in
new  desulphurisation  techniques  for  TPO.  Despite  this  progress,
none  of  the  reviewed  works  actually  managed  to  demonstrate
compliance with EN 590’s stringent sulphur limit of just 10 mg/kg
(0.001%wt.) for automotive diesel. However, the IMO ECA sulphur
limit of 0.1%wt. is apparently already within range for TPO and fur-
ther sulphur reduction can be achieved by combining the individ-
ual measures discussed in this section [186] .

3.4. Blending with other fuels and TPO addification

The  previous  sections ́discussions  on  TPO’s  physicochemical
properties such as density, viscosity, sulphur content, flash point
and  CN,  clearly  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  it  is  not  feasible  to
use  pure  TPO  as  an  automotive  drop-in  fuel.  However,  blending
TPO or DTPO with DF, biodiesel or SVO is possible, while keeping
blended fuel properties within standards. Moreover, some specific
properties of the TPO/DTPO can be utilised for regulation of the
overall properties of the fuel. This section reviews the state of re-
search into TPO/DTPO blends with other fuels and is summarised
in Table 7 .

Currently, there appears to be little attention paid to research
into use of crude TPO in binary mixtures with mineral diesel. Hür-
dogan et al. [187] analysed blends consisting of 50, 80 and 90%vol.
of crude TPO and corresponding amounts of DF. The authors ob-
served a gradual reduction of the mixture’s density and kinematic
viscosity  as  the  proportion  of  DF  was  increased.  Values  of  den-
sity and kinematic viscosity for TPO50 (50% TPO) were significantly
lower than for neat TPO and were in accordance with the require-
ments of EN 590. Note that the flash point of their baseline TPO
was surprisingly high ( > 100 °C), so the authors did not consider
this as a constraint. CN, however, was not reported.

Martínez et al. [180] investigated a blend of 5%vol. crude TPO
and 95%vol. of DF. They achieved a fuel compatible with the au-
tomotive diesel standard in all aspects except water and sulphur
content:  their values exceeded  EN 590 limits by 100%.  This was
due to a rather high content of both species in the crude TPO.

Sharma and Murugan [201] used biodiesel produced from jat-
ropha oil to prepare blends using the addition of crude pyrolytic
oil, from 10% to 50%. The cited authors found that increasing the
share of jatropha methyl esters reduced the blend’s density, while
kinematic viscosity and flash point increased. Additionally, the an-
tioxidative properties of TPO were utilised to compensate for weak
biofuel oxidative stability. A similar tendency was observed in the
later  work  of  the  same  authors  [17] .  The  authors  claimed  that
biodiesel  and  TPO  are  complementary  in  terms  of  viscosity  (too
high for biodiesel), flashpoint (too high for TPO) and CN (too low
for biodiesel). The 20% admixture of TPO was considered the near-
est to meeting EN 590: only its sulphur content and viscosity were
slightly too high. This could have been corrected by more efficient

∗ DMC - dimethyl carbonate
∗∗ NCV- net calorific valueThe distilled medium fraction of TPO obtained by Ambrosewicz-Walacik and Walacik [185] had extremely low viscosity. Hence, it was considered that only minor addition of this DTPO (between 1%vol.
and 2%vol.) would be sufficient for use as a viscosity improver. This was tested by adding it to a variety of blends comprising diesel and methyl esters produced from frying oil, all of which suffered from viscosity issues. The
thesis was verified negatively since the density and kinematic viscosity of the blends did not improve significantly after the addition of DTPO. However, even this small addition of pyrolytic oil contributed to a significant increase
in sulphur content and a reduction of flash point. The amount of sulphur was mostly determined by how much DTPO was added.

desulphurisation of the baseline TPO and by use of a viscosity im-
prover. Flash point values of all tested mixtures complied with EN
590. However, it is worth noting that the claimed flash point val-
ues  reported  for  corresponding  blends  in  Sharma  and  Murugan
[17]  and  their  earlier  work  [201]  are  significantly  different  (see
Table 7 ). Thus, the absolute values should be treated with caution
but the general statement regarding compliance of all the tested
mixtures with EN 590’s flash point limit still holds.

Other authors considered the use of distilled TPO to produce
binary mixtures with diesel or biodiesel. Murugan et al. [ 47 , 174 ]
examined DTPO blends with DF, using 80%vol. and 90%vol. DTPO
and 20%vol. and 10%vol. DF. They observed little changes in anal-
ysed properties such as density, kinematic viscosity, sulphur con-
tent and flash point compared with neat DTPO. Addition of DF ob-
viously improved all these properties but such high proportions of
DTPO (80% or more) with DF should be rather considered as an
academic idea because the resultant blend still falls well short of
EN 590. Al Mamun al. [93] investigated the parameters of a 50/50
blend of TPO and DF: their results led them to conclude even a
50/50 blend cannot satisfy EN 590. The authors, however, pointed
out that DTPO’s very low viscosity of 0.668 mm 2 /s makes it suit-
able  as  a  viscosity  improver.  Tudu  et  al.  [106]  added  40%  DF  to
their baseline DTPO and noticed the significant reduction in kine-
matic viscosity and density. The calorific value and cetane number
were close to the weighted (by volumetric shares) average of the
values of the individual components. As a cautionary note, the 40%
addition of DF reduced the flash point from the neat DTPO sam-
ple’s 75 °C to just 32 °C, implying that the fuel used as DF represen-
tative did not meet the EN 590 flash point requirement.

Tudu et al. also prepared a ternary blend, with 40%vol. of DTPO,
50%vol. of DF and 10%vol. of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) [106] . This
had significantly lower density and slightly lower kinematic vis-
cosity than the binary blend, but suffered from reduced calorific
value and cetane number index. Hariharan et al. [202] also sug-
gested that diethyl ether could be used as a cetane number im-
prover for TPO. The second part of Table 5 and the following dis-
cussion review ternary mixtures using TPO/DTPO as a component.
Follow-up works by Ambrosewicz-Walacik et al. [39] , Mikulski
et al. [18] disregarded the sulphur constraint, assuming desulphuri-
sation is possible. They increased the DTPO share to 5%vol, adding
it to FAME/DF blends and to rapeseed SVO (cold-pressed and fil-
tered) blends with DF, mixed at different ratios. The aim was to
find an economically feasible fuel needing only limited processing
and with major shares of renewables. A detailed characterisation
of the different blends can be found in Table 7 . The flash point
of all the blends was close to that of EN 590 diesel. The addition
of 5% DTPO greatly improved viscosity (by 20%-50%, depending on
the amount of biocomponent) although it was still well above EN
590’s requirement. The parameters, however, were still considered
suitable to operate modern diesel engines and so the samples were
subjected to engine tests focused on analysis of combustion and on
their full emission and efficiency profiles [ 39 , 41 ].

X  and SO

One of the newest methods used to improve fuel characteristics
2 )
involves  nano-additives.  Nanoparticles  of  titanium  dioxide  (TiO
can reduce pollutants such as NO
X  [204] . The effects of
those  additives  were  already  confirmed  by  Fangsuwannarak  and
Triratanasirchai,  who  tested  blends  of  palm  biodiesel  with  fossil
diesel and 0.1% or 0.2% addition of TiO
2 addition
contributed to the reduction of kinematic viscosity of different fu-
els blends. Results of tests using an automotive engine showed that
nanoparticles improved combustion completeness. Jeyakumar et al.
[203] analysed the effect of calcium carbonate and titanium diox-
ide  nano-additives  on  a  mixture  of  20%  TPO  with  80%  DF.  They
noted slight decreases of viscosity and density, but greater reduc-
tions of cloud and pour points. The flash point and cetane number
both increased.

The overall fuel properties obtained by TPO/DTPO blending dif-
fer significantly, depending on the share and quality of the individ-
ual components (bio and synthetic). However, from the above dis-
cussion it is possible to make the general observation that pyrolytic
oils and  biofuels seem complementary in terms  of  their proper-
ties.  This  relates  mostly  to  viscosity  (too  high  for  biofuels)  and
flash  point  (too  high  for  TPO).  This  complementary  relationship
also holds true, albeit to a lesser extent, to heating value (lower
energy density of biofuels can be compensated by TPO) and den-
sity. Note that almost none of the authors considering a high bio
component share or a high TPO share in diesel (above 50%) was
able to demonstrate full compliance with EN 590. Nevertheless, the
synergy of pyrolytic oils and biofuels, along with favourable results
achieved through addification of TPO with active particles, suggests
that future renewable liquid fuel research should focus on multi-
component mixtures. Using multiple components adds complexity
but addresses the feedstock availability issue.

4. Engine tests

There is a handful of engine research results involving TPO but
it  is  difficult  to  draw  firm  conclusions  about  how  TPO  impacts
combustion,  performance  and  emissions.  This  ambiguity  stems
from the variation in the tested engine platforms, operation con-
ditions and control strategies used by different authors. Addition-
ally, differences in feedstock quality, pyrolysis conditions and post-
processing  also  add  unwanted  variables  because  they  influence
TPO’s combustion properties and its propensity to produce toxic
exhaust compounds. Finally, TPOs can be admixed to different base
fuels, along with other additives, creating binary, ternary or even
more complex blends. We have attempted to use a systematic ap-
proach to this complex issue, presenting a summary of the most
important findings which, in our opinion, form the best thinking in
this field. It starts with the effects of mixture formation on com-
bustion,  and  then  deals  with  emissions.  Additionally,  results  ob-
tained from different engine platforms and for raw TPO, DTPO and
more complex blends are separated in order to provide a reliable
benchmark in each major sub-category of influential factors.

4.1. Mixture formation and combustion

As far as we can ascertain, there are no studies specifically fo-
cused on TPO spray development, atomisation and mixture forma-
tion. Therefore, spray behaviour of TPO and its blends can be only
qualitatively assessed based on engine test results and explained
via the fuel’s physical properties.

In conventional diesel combustion, some portion of fuel evapo-
rates and mixes with air during the ignition delay period. This frac-
tion, dependent on fuel volatility, viscosity and mixing time (gov-
erned by ignition delay) burns as a premixed charge. The remain-
ing, usually much larger fraction, is combusted in a diffusion flame
associated with the developing spray. Crude TPO has low CN, thus
contributing to elongated chemical ignition delay. It also appears to
be more volatile as it has a lower flashpoint. Both factors should
increase  the  premixed  burn  fraction,  resulting  in  a  more  rapid
pressure rise and higher peak temperatures than for DF combus-
tion.  These  deliberations  are  generally  confirmed  by  combustion
and  emissions  studies  reviewed  in  detail  below.  Note,  however,
that optical studies on spray development and mixture formation
are highly recommended to support fundamental understanding of
combustion and emission trends for TPO and its blends.

Tests with crude TPO on basic engine platforms
Basic  engine  platforms  include  those  that  are  naturally  as-
pirated,  without  exhaust  gas  recirculation  (EGR)  and  with  low-
pressure  mechanical  injection  systems  providing  single  injection.
Such engines seem obsolete when compared with modern auto-
motive designs, but their simplicity facilitates combustion study at

a fundamental level. The limited number of control parameters en-
ables reliable comparison of different research works. All the re-
search platforms included in this review section have a cylinder
bore  ranging  from  80  mm  to  110  mm,  typical  of  light-  to  mid-
duty, high-speed engines. They share a similar combustion system
design, using direct fuel injection with multi-hole injectors and in-
piston toroidal combustion chamber.

Murugan et al. [173] performed a series of experiments using
a single-cylinder, naturally-aspirated, air-cooled engine with 17.5:1
compression  ratio.  Fuel  was  delivered  in  a  single  dose,  using  a
low-pressure mechanical injection system. Experiments were per-
formed  at  a  fixed  speed  of  1500  rpm  and  under  variable  loads,
with  fixed  start  of  injection  (SOI)  timing.  Raw  TPO  was  mixed
with  DF  in  fractions  of  10%,  30%  and  50%  vol.  It  was  observed
that increasing the TPO fraction led to a longer auto-ignition delay,
which was attributed to TPO’s higher viscosity, poorer atomisation
and slower vaporisation. More importantly, it was noted that be-
cause of the longer ignition delay of TPO blends, these binary fu-
els were characterised by higher pressure rise rates (PRR), which
was associated with the combustion mode moving from diffusion-
controlled to premixed.

Frigo et al. [179] used a similar experimental platform, but with
a high compression ratio of 20.3:1. The single-pulse, low-pressure
injection was commenced at 12 ° of crank angle (CA) bTDC. The en-
gine tests were performed at full load and at speeds from 20 0 0
rpm to 3500 rpm. When the TPO content in DF did not exceed 20%,
the combustion process was very similar to that of pure DF. How-
ever, higher fractions of TPO provided substantial delay of auto-
ignition, and additionally rapid increase of cyclic variability, espe-
cially at low engine-speeds. A 40% TPO mixture at 30 0 0 rpm pro-
vided approximately 5 °CA delay of SOC when compared to DF. As
with previous studies, a low CN and high viscosity were indicated
as reasons to limit TPO content in DF.

Uyumaz et al. [206] used a single-cylinder, air-cooled, naturally-
aspirated engine with 18:1 compression ratio running at 2200 rpm
with fixed SOI timing at 24 °CA bTDC and with variable loads, i.e.
amounts of injected fuel. Comparison of DF and its mixture with
10%  of  TPO  showed  that  auto-ignition  delay  was  longer  for  the
TPO  blend.  Addition  of  TPO  delayed  auto-ignition  at  low  loads
by  approximately  0.1  ms,  which,  at  the  given  rotational  speed,
translated  to  1.3 °CA.  Differences  in  SOC  diminished  as  the  load
increased.

Chwist et al. [16] also used a basic engine platform, with 16.8:1
compression  ratio.  The  fuel  was  injected  with  SOI  set  to  28 °CA
bTDC. Rotational speed was 1500 rpm under fixed, medium load.
As with the above-mentioned studies, the results showed SOC de-
lay with increasing TPO content. Using pure TPO, SOC was delayed
by  approximately  8 °CA  in  comparison  with  DF.  The  in-cylinder
pressure curves from this study are shown in Fig. 14 . This study
also showed that the average SOC demonstrated higher variability,
where ignition timing was highly affected by dropping in-cylinder
temperature [16] .

The  picture  that  emerges  after  analysis  of  the  above  studies
shows that low admixtures - up to 20% - of raw TPO in DF can
be combusted in diesel engines without any modifications. SOC is
distinctly delayed at higher TPO concentrations, so most authors
advise advancing injection timing to compensate for increased ig-
nition delay. However, this technique also increases mixing time,
thus moving combustion more towards the premixed mode.

Using a single-cylinder diesel engine with mechanical injection,
Van de Beld et al. [207] found that it would be possible to com-
bust crude TPO provided that inlet-air temperature was increased
to 100-120 °C with an engine compression ratio of 17.6:1. Further-
more, if the compression ratio is increased to 22.4:1, the inlet-air
temperature  could  be  reduced  by  approximately  40 °C.  The  cited
authors also underlined that TPO’s high acidity makes it necessary

to substantially modify the fuel injection system to achieve appro-
priate material compatibility.

Tests of DTPO and DF on basic engine platforms
It should be noted that addition of TPO in DF must be limited to
ensure that the final properties of the blended fuel remain within
the specifications set by the relevant standards, especially for au-
tomotive applications. Thus, the studies applied a variety of treat-
ment  methods,  including  distillation  and  hydrotreatment,  to  up-
grade the TPO’s properties to enable its blending with DF at higher
ratios.  Many  authors  did  not  mention  the  distillation  process  in
their works, but the viscosity values indicated that purified, light
fractions of TPO were used. Thus, we apply the term DTPO to all
fuels with viscosity within or below the range specified in EN 590
[172] .

Kumar  Singh  and  Prabu  [208]  performed  their  tests  using
a single-cylinder, water-cooled engine with mechanical injection,
where SOI was fixed at 21 °CA bTDC. Engine load was varied from
idling  to  0.435  MPa  of  brake  mean  effective  pressure  (BMEP)  at
1500 rpm. In line with other studies, raising DTPO content in DF
delayed combustion and increased the peak heat release rate (HRR)
when compared with pure DF. However, the higher HRR applied
only until DTPO’s admixture rate reached 75%. With even higher
admixtures the peak HRR was reduced due to a substantial com-
bustion delay of approximately 12 °CA. The peculiar effect observed
was that auto-ignition was back advanced at 85% DTPO: the peak
HRR  location  was  between  the  one  for  DF  and  the  one  for  75%
DTPO. Importantly, end of combustion occurred at nearly the same
location for all tested fuels, from pure DF to the blend with 85%
DTPO.

 ̇Zółtowski [13] studied combustion of pure DTPO with DF-like
physical properties in a generator set engine incorporating a legacy
mechanical injection system. The injection timing was set in such
a way that while working on DF, the PRR did not exceed 6 bar/ °CA
throughout  a  range  of  engine  loads  from  1.6  to  4.5  bar  IMEP.
Switching  to  DTPO,  however,  increased  PRR  significantly  at  ele-
vated loads. The heat release analysis revealed that physical prop-
erties  of  DTPO  shift  the  combustion  towards  a  more  premixed
characteristic,  manifesting  by  higher  heat  release  rates  (refer  to
Fig.  15  for  details).  The  effect  increased  with  the  fuelling  rate
because the auto-ignition delay increased, elongating the mixing
time. Although the applied load range in this study is much below
that of contemporary diesel engines, the observed effects can shed
some light on emission trends discussed below.

Murugan et al. [ 47 , 174 ] performed engine tests with fuels con-
taining large amounts of DTPO, up to 90%. Their experiments were

performed on the basic engine platform and under the same con-
ditions  as  described  in  the  previous  subsection,  for  crude  TPO
[173] . Note that the viscosity of the DTPO used was half that of DF
and approximately half that used in studies mentioned in the two
previous paragraphs ([13,208]). Increasing the DTPO content to 90%
delayed  the  initial  pre-combustion  phase  (including  cold  flames
and negative temperature coefficient reactions) by approximately
2.5 °CA  This  phase  is  characterised  by  a  minor  heat  release  rate,
visible in Fig. 16 between -30 and -25 °CA. The high-temperature
combustion, starting with a characteristic peak resulting from the
premixed phase, remained similar for 90% DTPO and for DF, as ap-
parent in Fig. 16 . The discrepancy between this research and other
results discussed in this subsection can be attributed to use of dif-
ferent fractions of DTPO, which had different physical properties. It
is plausible that delayed combustion observed in other works re-
sulted primarily from physicochemical parameters of the fuel, i.e.
lower volatility. Data relating to the DTPO blends used by Muru-
gan et al. [174] are summarised in Table 7 .

Tests of TPO-derived fuels and DF on automotive-grade engine

platforms

The studies presented in the previous subsection were intended
primarily  to  understand  TPO’s  combustion,  whereas  the  experi-
ments using automotive engine platforms, reviewed in this section,
are rather aimed at verification of TPO as a drop-in fuel.

Martínez  et  al.  [180]  performed  their  research  on  a  modern,
light-duty,  automotive  engine  equipped  with  turbocharging  and
EGR. It also had common-rail (CR) fuel-injection, enabling the au-
thors to apply split fuel-injection. The engine was operated in the
steady states used in the new European drive cycle (NEDC), repro-
ducing loads typical of city driving. The engine was fuelled with

Fig. 17.  Heat release rates for DTPO and DF. Data acquired at 2400 rpm, full load,
turbocharged, single injection at 65 MPa, SOI = 1.1 °CA bTDC for DF, SOI = 1.5 °CA

(with intercooler). Reproduced from [105] with permission from Fuel, Elsevier.

DF  and  its  mixture  containing  5%  TPO.  The  combustion  analysis
showed  only  a  negligible  increase  in  combustion  duration  when
using the TPO admixture.

Vihar et al. [105] used a medium-duty, turbocharged and inter-
cooled engine but with a mechanical fuel-injection system. It was
run at 1500 rpm and 2400 rpm at various loads. The engine was
fuelled with 100% DTPO, distilled to achieve diesel-like fractions.
DF served as a benchmark. To compensate for TPO’s lower CN, the
authors  experimented  with  by-passing  the  intercooler  when  fu-
elling with DTPO, thus raising the temperature of the intake air to
help auto-ignition. The results are depicted in Fig. 17 , showing how
intake temperature compensated for DTPO’s lower CN. By-passing
the intercooler increased the intake air temperature from ca. 70 °C
to ca. 170 °C at full load and rated speed, making DTPO’s combus-
tion  rate  the  same  as  that  of  DF.  However,  at  lower  speeds,  al-
though the increase of intake temperature provided the same auto-
ignition timing, the DTPO  ́s combustion was shifted towards a more
premixed, kinetic mode.

Baškovi ˇc et al. [14] performed tests on a light-duty automotive
diesel engine with EGR and CR injection system, enabling the use
of split fuel-injection. The engine was fuelled with pure TPO, but
with a viscosity in accordance with EN 590. The authors manipu-
lated the pilot injection timings to compensate for delayed auto-
ignition and the resulting severe HRR of TPO. Diesel-like combus-
tion  of  pure  TPO  was  achieved  by  retarding  pilot  injection  by  a
few degrees in comparison with the engine’s original control map.
Moreover, the higher the engine load, the larger pilot injection re-
tardation was required.

Tests with TPO and DTPO blended with other fuels
Sharma and Murugan [201] tested different blends of TPO and
JME and DF on a basic engine platform with a single-cylinder, non-
EGR, mechanical injection with a three-hole injector and a com-
pression ratio of 17.5:1. The engine was run at 1500 rpm and at
various  loads.  SOI  timing  was  set  constant  at  23 °CA  bTDC.  Pure
JME exhibited shorter auto-ignition delay under these conditions
than the reference DF, due to JME’s higher CN. An admixture of
TPO, with cetane number lower than DF’s, compensated for this
combustion advance. Adding 20% of TPO in JME gave auto-ignition
1 °CA earlier than with DF. Adding 30% of TPO in JME gave auto-
ignition 1 °CA later than with DF. These results suggest that it could
be assumed that JME with 25% admixture of TPO would provide
auto-ignition properties the same as DF’s. However, differences in
viscosity mean that burn durations and HRR profiles differ, despite
the  same  auto-ignition  timings.  So,  although  JME  ignited  earlier
than DF, slower vaporisation extended JME’s combustion more to-
wards diffusion mode. Addition of TPO, which also acted as a com-
bustion  retarder,  resulted  in  a  substantial  extension  of  combus-
tion duration. These effects are clearly visible in Fig. 18 , compar-
ing HRR curves for different fuels and their blends. Continuation
of the above work by Sharma and Murugan was aimed at improv-
ing oxidation stability of 20% TPO admixture in JME by addition of
phenolic antioxidants, and at verification of antioxidants  ́effects on
combustion [17] . The engine’s compression ratio was raised from
17.5:1 to 18.5:1, aiming to tailor the engine parameters to the new
fuel. Some delay of combustion was noted when antioxidants were
added, but not to a significant degree.

Ambrosewicz-Walacik et al. [39] distilled light TPO fraction to
produce a low-viscosity fuel component. This DTPO was then used
to create a ternary blend of 5% DTPO, 40% DF and 55% raw rape-
seed  oil.  The  tests  were  performed  using  an  automotive  diesel-
engine with CR fuel-injection. The tests covered the whole oper-
ational range and included split fuel-injection at low speeds and
single injection at high speeds. Although the engine was operated
using standard calibration, the detailed HRR analyses showed some
specific combustion behaviour of the ternary mixture. Namely, al-
though at split fuel-injection the HRR traces for the mixture were
similar to DF’s, clear low-temperature combustion of pilot fuel was
observed in the case of the ternary mixture. The research was con-
tinued by Mikulski et al. [18] using different blends of the above-
mentioned fuels. All the tested blends included 5% DTPO but had
differing quantities of rapeseed oil, ranging from 20% to 55%: DF
made up the remainder of each blend. The HRR curves for split
fuel injection did not show any significant differences between all
tested blends and pure DF. However, the low-temperature combus-
tion fraction was increasing as the biofuel share rose.

4.2. Emissions

This  section  considers  the  validations  of  TPO-based  fuels  in
end-use engine performance from the perspective of emissions. It
aims to shed light on the potential and limitations of using TPO as
an alternative to conventional diesel. As a preliminary remark, it
should be noted that fuel-related exhaust emission trends depend
strongly upon (i) a fuel’s physical properties, which determine in-
jection, atomisation, mixture formation etc., and (ii) a fuel’s chem-
ical properties, which determine auto-ignition timing and combus-
tion chemistry itself. Therefore, both physical and chemical param-
eters should be considered when discussing emissions.

The most problematic species in diesel exhaust are particulate
matter (PM) and NO
X . A temperature/fuel-air ratio map ( Fig. 19 )
helps  us  to  physically-wise  understand  the  paths  of  their  cre-
ation. It shows the soot/NO
X trade-off typical of diesel-engine com-
bustion. Concerning NO
X , their creation is firstly correlated with
peak combustion temperature (thermal mechanism) and secondly,
with higher local excess air, supporting oxidiser entrainment. Thus,
more premixed combustion generally tends to produce more NO
X .
Alternatively, less premixed fuel and limited oxidiser access gener-
ates more soot, because combustion operates with a local oxygen
deficiency. Finally, it should be noted that although the combustion
process always runs along the reaction line presented in Fig. 19 , it
is the amount of fuel that undergoes combustion along the indi-
vidual mechanism that determines the emissions.

4.2.1. Nitrogen oxides

There are recognised paths of NO

X  formation during combus-
tion. The three predominant mechanisms are: Zeldovich (thermal),
Fenimore (prompt) and N
2 O (fuel). The first and the last of these
are  the  prevailing  mechanisms  in  diesel  engines  [ 188 , 210 ].  Most
NO
X  in  raw  diesel  exhaust  gas  is  NO,  produced  mainly  in  the
boundary layer of the diffusion flame, where the excess air ratio
is nearly stoichiometric, providing favourable temperature (above
1800 K) and access to oxygen. Fuel’s effects on NO
X emissions from
diesel engines were extensively investigated when researching var-
ious  biofuels  and  waste  fuels.  Generally,  in  the  case  of  the  first
generation biofuels (fatty acid esters), much engine research indi-
X emissions when compared to
cated that they led to increased NO
X  emissions were re-
DF [211] . In the case of paraffinic fuels, NO
ported to be lower [ 3 , 211 ]. The review by Bergthorson and Thom-

X  emissions  from  pyrolytic  fuels  are
son  [211]  revealed  that  NO
roughly half of that from DF. However, this conclusion was based
mostly on research of liquids obtained from biomass, mainly wood.

Tests with crude TPO on basic engine platforms
Murugan et al. [173] performed engine tests without EGR and
with single injection. They found that increasing the TPO content
in  DF  from  10%  to  50%  reduced  NO
X  concentration,  but  only  at
low loads: NO
X concentration increased at higher loads. This non-
monotonic trend was explained by the fuel’s effect on a combi-
nation of local stoichiometry and temperature. Additionally, it was
pointed out that a higher aromatics content in TPO can increase
propensity to form NO
X  concentrations
were correlated  with trends in exhaust  temperature, which sug-
gests  predominating  effects  of  fuel  on  global  stoichiometry.  The
trends  at  low  loads  were  confirmed  by  Chwist  et  al.  [16] .  They
X  emissions when the fuel was
achieved ca. 20% reduction of NO
changed from neat DF to 20% TPO/DF mixture. Interestingly, NOx
emissions from 100% TPO were double that of neat DF. Combustion
of pure TPO was heavily delayed (refer to Fig. 14 ), thus giving a
higher premixed fraction and higher bulk combustion temperature.

X . Observed trends in NO

Tests with refined TPO on basic engine platforms
Rising  trends  in  NOx  emissions  were  not  consistent  with  in-
creasing  engine  loads  when  using  mixtures  containing  20%,  80%
and  90%  of  DTPO.  NO
X  emissions  reduced  for  higher  shares  of
DTPO at high loads, whereas there was no significant fuel effect
observed at low loads [ 47 , 174 ]. The discrepancy between these re-
sults  indicated  that  emissions were  affected  by  the  reduction  in
viscosity (reduced by about 50% via distillation) and the removal
of heavy hydrocarbons. Similar results were achieved by Frigo et al.
[179] on a similar engine platform and using TPO with similar vis-
cosity. Both 20% and 40% TPO samples provided a reduction of NO
X
emissions  at  full  load,  whereas  results  were  inconclusive  at  the
medium and low loads.

Do  ̆gan et al. [15] used a basic engine platform with mechani-
cal injection system and a fuel dose fixed to the maximum torque.
They found that increasing DTPO content in DF reduces excess air.
NO
X concentration increased with DTPO admixture for all investi-
gated engine speeds ( Fig. 20 ). Additionally, the trend was not linear
at low speed (1400 rpm), with rapid increase of NO
X concentration
at the highest (90%) admixture of DTPO.

 ̇Zółtowski  [13]  compared  DF  with  neat  DTPO  and  found  that
X emissions from both fuels were comparable at partial loads.
NO
However,  DTPO  reduced  NO
X  emissions  by  ca.  25%  at  near-idle
regime,  but  elevated  them  when  operating  at  high  engine-load,
X  levels re-
as shown in Fig. 21 . Aside from the fact that the NO
ported in this study were generally very high (due to the nature of
the legacy engine platform), the observed trends can be explained
by analysing the HRR curves in Fig. 15. For low engine-loads, in-
creased auto-ignition delay did not result in increased peak HRR,
yet retarded combustion reduced peak in-cylinder temperature. On

the other hand, at high loads, a severe increase in peak HRR greatly
affects the in-cylinder temperature.

Comparison of emission performance of distilled and crude TPO
from the same feedstock was performed by Murugan et al. [212] .
They tested DF and its blends containing 30% of TPO or DTPO. They
showed that admixture of TPO did not change emission levels over
the  whole  load  range  whereas  admixture  of  DTPO  reduced  NO
X
emissions. Moreover, the difference increased in line with engine
load,  with  the  NO
X  reduction  growing  from  ca.  10%  at  near-idle
conditions to ca. 20% at full load.

Recently, Uslu [213] has attempted to optimise a blend consist-
ing of low viscosity TPO and DF, using legacy engine experiments.
The optimised parameters were the blend  ́s proportion of TPO and
the  injection  pressure.  It  was  found  that  increasing  TPO  admix-
ture content above 30% led to a rapid increase in NO
X emissions,
X was negligible when admixture was
whereas TPO’s effect on NO
below 30%. As could be forecast, NO
X emissions fell with reduced
injection pressure, although other emission factors deteriorated.

Tests with TPO-derived fuels on automotive engines
Martínez et al. [180] conducted testing using a multi-cylinder
Euro 5–certified (EGR) engine, exploring different operating points.
He found that 5% admixture of TPO slightly increased engine-out
NO
X emissions for all operating conditions, except low loads. This
result  contradicted  others  using  similar  platforms.  Bodisco  et  al.
[214] used 10% admixture of TPO in DF to fuel a Euro 5 passenger
car with a modern common-rail fuel-injection system, but without
a NO
X trap. The tests were realised in real driving conditions which
included equal proportions of urban and rural driving. The authors
showed no significant changes to NO
X emissions from fuel to fuel
across the whole cycle, but noted more significant differences at
particular load/speed combinations.

Baškovi ˇc  et  al.  [14]  used  pure  DTPO  to  fuel  an  automotive
common-rail, direct-injection engine, advancing the pilot injection
to achieve nearly the same combustion course as when using DF.
X concentrations at similar HRR profiles showed
Comparison of NO
that DTPO increases emissions by ca. 20%, both at low-load and
high-load  conditions,  as  shown  in  Fig.  22 .  After  eliminating  the
combustion rate effect, it was concluded that DTPO produces more
NO

X due to its fuel-bound nitrogen.
Tests of TPO blends with other fuels
Using  mixtures  of  TPO  and  JME,  Sharma  and  Murugan
[201] identified clear NO
X emissions trends, importantly the same
for  various  engine  loads  ( Fig.  23 ).  Combustion  of  pure  JME  pro-
duced ca. 20% more NO than when fuelling with DF. However, in-
creasing  TPO  admixture  from  10%  to  50%  served  to  reduce  NO
X

emissions,  compensating  for  JME’s  effect.  These  trends  could  be
attributed to the opposite physical and auto-ignition properties of
biofuel and TPO. Biofuels ignite earlier but have a higher boiling
temperature, which contributes to mixing-controlled combustion.
TPO has a lower CN, and thus ignites later, but it contains light
fractions which evaporate earlier. Overall, and under most condi-
tions, emissions from combustion of a 50% TPO and 50% JME blend
were a few percent higher than DF’s emissions.

Mikulski et al. [18] used a light fraction of DTPO to reduce vis-
cosity of raw vegetable oil. The test fuels were composed of 5%
DTPO and from 30% to 55% of rapeseed oil, with DF making up
the remainder. Tests were performed using a common-rail automo-
tive engine with standard calibration. There were no differences in
NO
X emissions between different fuels and the reference DF at low
loads, but a clear trend was evident at higher loads. The higher the
rapeseed oil content, the higher were the observed emissions. At
the 80% load, the addition of DTPO to the rapeseed oil/diesel mix-
ture was responsible for higher NO
X emissions than a comparable
mixture of FAME and diesel.

4.2.2. Particulate matter and smoke opacity

PM  consists  of  insoluble  and  soluble  fractions.  Soot  and  ash
are components of the insoluble fraction; whereas the soluble one
consists of organic carbon, sulphate and nitrate [215] . Soot, which
is  a  precursor  of  PM,  is  intensively  created  in  the  first  stage  of
combustion, typically at the tip of the fuel spray, where a rich mix-
ture is burnt volumetrically and then turns into mixing-controlled
combustion. The production of PM is chemically increased by the
presence of alkynes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH),
so  TPO’s  poorer  atomisation  and  high  PAH  content  should  lead

to  the  production  of  more  PM  than  is  the  case  with  DF.  Addi-
tionally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  NO
X  and  PM  emissions  usually
are subjected to a trade-off when combustion shifts between pre-
mixed  and  diffusion-controlled.  More  premixed  combustion  pro-
duces  more  NO
X ,  whereas  diffusion-controlled  combustion  pro-
duces  more  PM.  Finally,  sulphur’s  effect  on  PM  creation  cannot
be neglected when considering TPO. The sulphur content increases
the mass of sulphates bound in PM, although this effect is not sub-
stantial, because most of the sulphur is converted to SO

2 [216] .

The majority of available research uses measurement of exhaust
opacity as an indicator of PM concentration. These two parameters
are always correlated in CI engines and enable comparative anal-
yses, although opacity does not provide quantitative information
about PM emissions.

Tests with TPO/DTPO on basic engine platforms
The trends in PM and smoke emissions on engines with single-
pulse injection and in non-EGR conditions are summarised below.
Murugan et al. [173] used blends of DF with TPO admixtures rang-
ing from 10% to 50%. They did not report any significant changes in
exhaust opacity across the whole load range, except at maximum
power, where 50% addition of TPO increased opacity by 7%. How-
ever, the 40% TPO addition slightly reduced opacity compared with
DF. In other works [ 47 , 174 ], the same research group found that
DTPO produces more smoke than DF and they recorded that in-
creasing the proportion of DTPO admixture increases exhaust opac-
ity. Moreover, comparison of emissions from TPO and DTPO 30%
admixtures showed that TPO did not affect smoke emissions across
the whole range of engine loads. At the same time, admixture of
DTPO  increased  smoke  emission  by  ca.  20%,  but  only  at  higher
engine-loads. Fuel effects on PM and smoke emissions were negli-
gible or at least inconclusive at low loads.

Tests with TPO-derived fuels on automotive engines
Martínez et al. [180] performed detailed analysis of smoke and
PM emissions from an automotive engine fuelled with a 5% TPO
blend in DF. At different points of the engine operating map both
opacity and PM emissions were higher with this blend than with
only DF, as shown in Fig. 24 . This was attributed to TPO’s higher
aromatics content and also to its poorer vaporisation, due to higher
final boiling point. The measurements of PM emissions were sup-
ported by analysis of particle size distribution. It was found that
the size distributions of both tested fuels were the same at low
loads, whereas under higher loads the distributions for fuel con-
taining  TPO  shifted  towards  smaller  particles.  This  was  ascribed

combustion.  The  second  dominating  mechanism,  more  likely  for
diesel  engines,  is  low  flame  temperature.  This  can  occur  when
combustion is delayed towards the expansion stroke or if the fuel
is  highly  diluted,  by  recirculated  exhaust,  for  example.  CO  and
HC emissions trends for TPO-derived fuels and mixtures are sum-
marised here.

Working on a simple engine platform, Murugan et al. observed
that both CO and HC concentrations generally rise with increasing
TPO  admixture  to  DF,  independently  of  engine  load  [ 47 , 173 , 174 ].
The  increase  in  CO  with  addition  of  TPO  was  attributed  solely
to delayed combustion and thus inhibited CO oxidation. Similarly,
Kumar Singh and Prabu [208] reported an increase of concentra-
tions of both components. The trends in both works appear con-
sistent. Shifting fuel from DF to pure TPO almost doubled CO con-
centration, while the increase in HC content for the same transi-
tion would be approximately 50%. Examples of CO and HC emis-
sion trends from the work by   ̇Zółtowski [13] are shown in Fig. 26 .
In contrast, Chwist et al. reported a decrease of CO concentration
with increasing TPO content [16] . However, it should be noted that
the baseline CO concentrations reported in this work were already
ultra-high, at 3%. The trend in HC emissions was not monotonic,
but indicated an increase in the exhaust’s HC content when 10% or
more TPO was added to DF. Do ˇgan et al. [15] , using a naturally as-
pirated engine at full load, found that the CO and HC trends were
dependent on engine speed. At low speed (1400 rpm), using a TPO
content  of 90% reduced CO  by 50% and HC by 20%,  when com-
pared  to  DF.  Results  were  inconclusive  at  engine  speeds  beyond
this point.

In the case of TPO mixtures with biofuels, Sharma and Murugan
[201] observed that emissions of both CO and HC when using pure
JME are about 10-20% lower than with DF. Addition of TPO to JME
increased both emissions. The CO and HC emissions were similar to
those from DF when the TPO admixture to JME reached about 30%.
Using a more advanced automotive engine platform, Martínez
et  al.  [180]  evaluated  emissions  from  a  5%  admixture  of  TPO  to
DF. They found the admixture increased emissions of both CO and
HC by approximately 10% compared to DF, but only at near-idle
conditions.  Differences between the  test  fuels  were  negligible at
moderate and high loads. Furthermore, increased emissions of aro-
matics were reported under all conditions and attributed to higher
aromatic content in TPO. Similar results in terms of HC emissions
were achieved by Baškovi ˇc et al. [14] , although they compared DF
with pure TPO. These results revealed sensitivity to EGR of low-CN
fuels, like TPO.

5. A critical overview and outlook on further research

The last decade has brought an exponential increase of research
into the use of TPO as a combustion engine fuel. However, the un-
clear status of TPO production technology, wide discrepancy in TPO
quality, the different blending strategies and the variety of engine
platforms used for testing all make it difficult to pin down the cur-
rent status of the research. These factors have been reviewed in
Sections 2 , 3 and 4 . This section’s aim is to distil the knowledge
captured in this review into a concise vision of TPO as a fuel com-
ponent in combustion engines. This is best done by answering the
research questions posed in Section 1.3 of the introduction.

The overview and outlook below provide a focused perspective
on applications for TPO-derived fuels and further research in this
field. This research is most definitely needed if TPO fuels are to be-
come part of a solution capable of solving the sustainability issue
and GHG problem.

What is the current view on TPO well-to-tank environmental

impact and economic feasibility?

On a well-to-tank basis, TPO as a waste-derived fuel is consid-
ered as one of the negative GHG impact solutions. Taking account

to TPO’s sulphur and metals contents. Analysis of PM composition
showed that PM generated by TPO contains a higher volatile or-
ganic fraction ( Fig. 24 ).

Tests of TPO blends with other fuels
Measurements  of  exhaust  opacity  by  Sharma  and  Murugan
[201] when using blends of TPO with JME show a clear trade-off
X emissions. Compare Figs. 23 and 25 for details. Combus-
with NO
tion of pure JME reduced opacity in comparison with DF. The re-
duction was substantial - approximately 30% - at higher loads. In-
creasing TPO content in JME from 10% to 50% gradually increased
exhaust opacity to a level slightly above that when fuelling with
DF. Opacity with 20%-30% admixtures of TPO in JME was compara-
ble to that with DF.

Recent works by Ambrosewicz-Walacik et al. [39] and Mikulski
et al. [18] were aimed at making it feasible to use raw bio-oils in
diesel engines, employing light fractions of DTPO to reduce viscos-
ity. Addition of 5% of low-viscosity DTPO to a mixture containing
40% of DF and 55% of bio-oil produced some reduction of exhaust
opacity. However, a dramatic increase in smoke was observed at
higher engine-loads and with split (pilot and main) injection [39] .
This increase was found to be correlated with combustion rates,
specifically advance of auto-ignition. Coupled with the poor atomi-
sation of highly viscous fuel, this resulted in rich combustion, pro-
ducing  large  amounts  of  soot.  Interestingly,  the  fuel’s  effect  on
smoke was much smaller with a single injection of fuel, because
the fuel had less of an effect on combustion rates. Finally, it has
been found that injection strategy strongly affects the emissions
response to fuel type. Further research with the same 5% DTPO ad-
mixture, but with variable amounts of bio-oil and DF, showed that,
in general, ternary fuel reduces exhaust opacity using both single
and split fuel-injection. However, this effect is most noticeable at
moderate load. Moreover, the proportion of bio-oil content did not
show any clear trend in opacity.

4.2.3. CO and unburnt hydrocarbons

Emissions of CO and HC from diesel engines are far less prob-
lematic  than  NO
X  and  PM  [217] .  The  amounts  are  small  and
these species can be burnt effectively in oxidation catalytic reac-
tors, provided that the exhaust temperature is high enough [218] .
Nevertheless,  TPO-derived  fuels  also  affect  these  emissions.  This
is  mainly  due  to  differences  in  the  physical  parameters  of  fu-
els. Highly viscous fuels have higher liquid fuel spray penetration,
which can result in wall impingement by fuel. This phenomenon
usually produces high amounts of HC because not all the fuel is
burnt during combustion. CO is mainly a residue from incomplete
combustion if the mixture is too rich to oxidise CO at the end of

2 e/kg of CO

of the added value to the circular economy, the net GHG footprint
is assessed on a level of -0.9 to -1.6 kgCO
2  removed
from the environment [ 138 , 219 ]. On the gross basis, the well-to-
tank CO
2 emission of TPO production is of an order of magnitude
smaller than that of first-generation biofuels. In this respect, TPO
surpasses both SVO and FAME/HVO derived from bio-oils. Taking
into account engine compatibility issues and the extent of process-
ing required to satisfy this compatibility, TPO is also GHG- superior
with respect to popular waste-derived biofuels (TME, UCOME). The
present study implies gross well-to-tank GHG emission of TPO on
an average level of 3.76 g CO
2 e/MJ, a value comparable to bio-oil
extraction alone.

The increasing social impact of GHG emission has a pronounced
influence  on  the  fuel  market.  As  shown  in  this  study,  currently
most  waste-derived  fuels  and  feedstock  command  market  prices
that are similar to or higher than first-generation SVOs and FAMEs.
TPO still stands apart from this trend. With a stable average market
price of $350/10 0 0 kg – a figure almost unchanged over 10 years
– it is roughly one third of the price of all the mentioned biofuels
and it is price competitive with gasoil. This creates an opportunity
for TPO to be accommodated by markets that traditionally cannot
afford expensive fuels and thus struggle to compete with the likes
of  automotive  and  aviation  sectors  when  seeking  sustainable  al-
ternative fuels. Recent analysis shows that these two markets cur-
rently account for over 90% of all liquid biofuel availability [220] .
It must be acknowledged that TPO  ́s low market price is partly a
consequence of a relatively low global demand for this fuel. If this
is  about  to  change  in  the  current  energy  transition  period,  cou-
pled with scaling-up the production, the future price-availability
balance of TPO is still unknown.

Adding to the list of uncertainties is the overall environmen-
tal and economic feasibility of TPO production. Though available
LCA studies on TPO indicate that pyrolysis is currently one of the
ecological and net beneficial ELT management routes, we currently
lack any reliable comparative LCA with other sustainable fuel al-
ternatives.  This  is  a  serious  knowledge  gap.  The  authors ́realistic
view of the overall financial feasibility of fuel production-oriented
tyre  pyrolysis  is  inconclusive  because  of  the  uncertain  future  of
TPO’s market price, unfavourable ELT management legislation and
the lack of up-to-date, quality studies on the economics of large-
scale pyrolytic plants. It should be noted that the common opinion
that tyre pyrolysis is not commercially feasible mainly stems from
several  big  implementation  projects  from  the  1980s  and  1990s.
Against  the  backdrop  of  the  current  energy  transition,  this  view
has to be reconsidered.

As a final critical note, it is fair to point out that the mentioned
knowledge gap on TPO’s LCA and economics does not mean that

the number of works available on the topic is lacking. In fact, it
is the reliability of the studies, which in many cases are based on
biased assumptions, that has been found to be questionable.

What is the progress in pyrolysis technology with respect to

maximising the TPO yield and resulting fuel quality?

The  review  has  shown  a  rapid  emergence  of  research-grade,
pilot-scale tyre pyrolysis plants. The demonstrators are gradually
moving towards more advanced designs, including whole tyre py-
rolysis  [75] .  Process  temperature  is  considered  the  most  critical,
and the most investigated, optimisation parameter here. The best
results in terms of TPO yield, calorific value and minimised energy
input typically are reported to come in the temperature range of
450-650 °C. Further elevation of the temperature not only demands
greater energy input but the intensified rubber cracking results in
more high-volatility hydrocarbons transferred to the gaseous frac-
tion, reducing the TPO yield. Furthermore, elevated temperatures
lead to undesirable increases in TPO’s viscosity and density, as well
as  its  sulphur  and  aromatics  content.  Turning  to  TPO  yield,  the
most frequently reported maximum TPO yield is 50%wt. (based on
median from Table 2 / Table A1 ) but the state of the art is cur-
rently reported to be up to 60% on the mass basis, when coupled
with high heating values (based on median from Table 6: HHV = 43
MJ/kg, LHV = 41 MJ/kg).

Notably, even without specific reactor optimisation, the CN of
TPO meets the US on-road fuel standards as well as all standards
for off-road and marine fuels. Achieving viscosity and density val-
ues that are within EN 590 limits does not pose a challenge, yet
must overcome the trade-off with the fuel’s flashpoint. TPO  ́s high,
diesel-like oxidative stability is another of its quality advantages
as fuel. Crude TPO  ́s properties do not deteriorate significantly with
time, which is a common issue for most biodiesels. Hydrolysis and
microbial growth do not pose additional problems for TPO, assum-
ing the feedstock or end product are properly dehydrated.

However, there are fuel quality challenges for TPO, notably high
sulphur  and  polyaromatic  hydrocarbons  contents  and  potential
acidity issues. In the light of tightening global legislation, sulphur
content is by far the biggest and most immediate challenge for di-
rect applications of TPO as an automotive fuel. Typical sulphur val-
ues for crude TPO produced in an optimised reactor are in a range
of 0.3 -1.0%, although figures below 0.01% were also noted for hy-
drogenative pyrolysis. This means desulphurisation is vital for any
automotive application where EN 590’s 0.001% sulphur limit ap-
plies, even if blends are considered. TPO’s route to marine applica-
tions looks easier, with the IMO global and ECA sulphur caps set
at 0.5% and 0.1% respectively. The high content of PAHs poses a
challenge due to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, as well as the
propensity to form soot. This issue, as well as the sulphur content

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100915

and the flash-point/viscosity trade-off, can be partially solved by
TPO-upgrading, as summarised in the next subsection.

In  terms  of  TPO  acidity,  the  results  so  far  are  inconclusive.
Reports vary from diesel-like acidity to values that are 10 times
higher than the current automotive standards. Obviously, acidity,
as  well  as  other  chemical  properties  of  crude  TPO,  depends  on
pyrolysis conditions, yet this dependency has not been sufficiently
studied.

This  brings  us  to  the  general  knowledge  gap  in  the  field
of  tyre  pyrolysis  technology.  An  observation  from  this  review  is
that most applied researchers studying how best to produce TPO
are focusing on a single process parameter, such as temperature,
without  considering  the  underlying  mechanisms  and  parameter
cross-influences.  Equally,  there  are  many  excellent  fundamental-
level studies on mechanisms of tyre pyrolysis which lack the ap-
plied perspective towards optimising TPO quality as fuel. Notably,
achieving optimum TPO yield and composition depends not only
on process temperature and on reactor type and its mechanical pa-
rameters, but also on rubber particle size (from powder to whole
tyres), inert gas flow and many other factors. On a more funda-
mental  level,  all  these  variables  come  down  to  the  mechanisms
of  transient  heat  transfer  to  the  rubber  elements,  gas  diffusion
through  the  solid  material  and  gas  retention  time  before  cool-
ing  and  condensation.  Therefore,  elaboration  of  thermodynamic
and gas flow models, combined with solid decomposition and gas
chemical  kinetics  would  enable  understanding  of  the  discrepan-
cies between experimental studies, and thus reduce global applied
research effort. As well as the need to connect fundamental and
applied-level  research,  comes  a  need  for  research  to  investigate
multi-parameter optimisation of reactor operation.

Finally, among the open research fronts is investigation of co-
pyrolysis  of  tyres  with  biomass.  This  is  a  relatively  new  con-
cept,  so  the  number  of  available  works  on  this  topic  is  limited
and  scattered  over  different  feedstock  configurations.  The  syner-
gistic  effects  seem  evident,  yet  not  sufficiently  understood.  The
research trajectory, however, seems very important from the per-
spective of achieving high-quality fuel, increasing the oil yield and,
at the same time, tackling the availability limitations of sustain-
able/renewable feedstocks.

What are the available TPO-upgrading technologies and what is

their effect on the end-fuel quality?

Assuming the pyrolysis itself is fairly well optimised, crude TPO
has the potential to fulfil the requirements of marine and of-road
fuel standards. Automotive fuel regulations can be met, except in
terms of the aforementioned viscosity/flashpoint trade-off and the
sulphur content. Thus, when starting with a relatively high qual-
ity  of  crude  oil,  it  is  probably  not  economically  feasible  to  ap-
ply  refinery-grade  cracking  processes,  such  as  hydrocracking,  for
instance.  Indeed,  those  processes  have  not  been  widely  demon-
strated  with  TPO  and,  according  to  available  literature,  refinery-
grade  sulphur  removal  (HDS)  is  deemed  to  be  hardly  effective
when  considering  the  constraints  of  automotive  fuel  market  re-
quirements. It is worth noting that the 2016 EU-project SULFREE
attempted  to  combine  state-of-the-art  microwave  pyrolysis  with
refinery grade hydrotreating, yet failed to achieve TPO with sul-
phur levels below 0.1% [221] .

Considering the above, the future TPO-upgrading technologies
will most probably orient towards infrastructurally low-cost solu-
tions, suiting the trend in distributed TPO  production with low-
volume reactors with capacity to process 10 0-20 0 tonnes per day
of ELTs. On the basis of that scenario, this review identified two
main low-cost desulphurisation processes for TPO: fractional dis-
tillation and extraction using ionic liquids.

Many different strategies of TPO fractionation have been tested
while attempting to achieve fuel properties within EN 590 limits. It
has to be said that none is completely successful. Fractional distil-

lation of TPO, yielding DTPO, generally offers regulation of viscosity
and cold properties. Accurate fractionation supports the removal of
PAHs, which have high boiling points. The desulphurisation effects
achieved  by  distillation  vary  from  study  to  study.  Application  of
ionic solutions for liquid-liquid extraction was also demonstrated,
showing  potential  to  halve  sulphur  content  on  average.  Bearing
in mind that the addition of an in-reactor catalyst helps to opti-
mise pyrolysis, and that a TPO sulphur level below 0.01% has al-
ready  been  achieved,  further  progress  towards  TPO  fuel  applica-
tions seems feasible, if fuel blending is considered.

Ultimately, providing a direct quantitative answer to the ques-
tion  regarding  achievable  fuel  quality  by  application  of  different
upgrading technologies seems impossible at this moment. This per-
tains to the knowledge gap similar to one related to TPO produc-
tion, described in the previous subsection. Namely, the research di-
rected to optimising engine-related fuel properties is so far, in the
great majority of cases, performed without a basic chemical back-
ground and analytical support. In contrast, the fundamental-level
research on TPO fractional analysis lacks the targeted context of
achieving superior engine-fuel properties. For example, trade-offs
between viscosity and flashpoint implied by some researchers for
DTPO can be avoided if distillation curve analysis is used to per-
form targeted fractionation.

What is TPOs potential as a fuel component?
Although progress in desulphurisation techniques and develop-
ments in pyrolysis process control is improving its quality, TPO’s
most  feasible  application  is  probably  not  as  a  stand-alone  fuel.
Blends are the favoured route, not only because they facilitate the
improvement of the end-fuel  ́s properties, but also from the per-
spective of availability. No single alternative fuel, such as waste fu-
els, biofuels or synthetic electro-fuels, will be capable of becoming
a full substitute for all fossil diesel. Blending with diesel or heavy
fuel oils is the obvious strategy here.

A  promising route  for  TPO-derived fuels  is to  take advantage
of their complementary properties with biofuels. Biofuels usually
suffer from high viscosity (FAME) or poor lubricity (HVO) yet offer
substantial reserves in terms of flashpoint and CN. TPO/DTPO has
the opposite characteristics. Another potential route for non-road
applications of DTPO, especially in developing countries, might be
to use its light fractions as an effective viscosity improver when
raw vegetable oils are admixed to diesel. This was demonstrated
by  Mikulski  et  al.  [18] .  It  was  also  pointed  out  in  the  literature
[17] that TPO can offer an additional benefit in biofuel blends be-
cause it improves storage stability when mixed with FAME.

Fuel blending is at the bridge of fuel-engine research and the
major issue with the current situation comes from the fact that
research in this field is mainly performed by applied engine re-
searchers. They often try to find the right way to use TPO by pick-
ing from a wide range of possible blending strategies, but inves-
tigate  routes  that  could  be  immediately  ruled  out  with  a  better
consideration of differences in chemical make-up. More complex,
tailored  blends  should  be  explored.  This  fuel  blend  design  chal-
lenge  should  be  supported  by  the  development  and  use  of  pre-
dictive  models  that  can  target  specific  properties  or  engine  per-
formance [222] . Development of these models should be strongly
encouraged in order to focus experimental testing and accelerate
the development of sustainable liquid fuels: climate change does
not allow the luxury of time.

How do different fuel compositions of TPO and TPO-derived
fuels perform in the engine in terms of combustion characteristics,
efficiency and emissions?

The review of engine test results reveals several trends. Within
the constraints of the quality of the TPO samples used, small ad-
mixtures of crude TPO (up to 10%) to diesel can be used without
any profound effects on the combustion process and connected ef-
ficiency, while avoiding issues with catalyst poisoning Using pro-

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100915

cessed  (distilled and  desulphurised) TPO  can  further  extend  this
admixture  limit  somewhat  higher  than  10%.  At  such  conditions,
X  emissions  can  be  slightly  elevated,  evident  only  at  higher
NO
loads, and CO and HC can increase by approximately 10%, but only
at low loads. Note that these differences in state-of-the-art com-
bustion engines are reported to disappear over the driving cycle
when using low levels of TPO additions.

When  combustion  effects  are  neglected,  TPOs  tend  to  emit
more NO
X due to higher amounts of fuel-bound nitrogen. Greater
CO and HC emissions result from higher viscosity and poorer spray
atomisation, limiting oxygen entrainment. TPO increases PM emis-
sion because of its high aromatic and sulphur contents. Both these
fractions are found to promote PM formation, which in the case
of TPO, usually is composed of small-diameter particulates. These
smaller particles are proven to have a more deleterious impact on
human  health.  Note,  however,  that  reports  documenting  quanti-
tative particulate mass or number for TPO combustion are rather
scarce: most authors instead used smoke opacity as the basis for
their conclusions on PM. Opacity was more likely to be influenced
by local mixture stoichiometry.

The  abovementioned  fuel-related  effects  on  emission  can  be
scaled with increased TPO fuel content and also can be partially
neutralised by optimum fuel composition. Large-scale TPO admix-
ture makes the effect of the fuel  ́s properties on combustion be-
come more pronounced, in turn influencing emissions to a much
greater  extent.  Delayed  auto-ignition  is  commonly  reported  for
TPO or DTPO additions above 20%, shifting combustion towards a
more premixed mode, which usually generates higher peak tem-
peratures, elevating NO
X emissions. Long ignition delays also shift
combustion from its optimum timing, and thus impact engine ef-
ficiency. Fuel viscosity and cetane number are primary drivers of
ignition  delay.  High  viscosity  is  relevant  only  for  non-processed
TPO samples and harms combustion at high-load regimes where
spray formation is the main limiting factor for ignition. TPO’s lower
cetane number is responsible for increased chemical ignition de-
lay manifesting at low loads and at high EGR ratios. Van de Beld
et al. proved that this low CN effect can be successfully mitigated
by elevating the intake-air temperature [207] . This technique al-
lowed the combustion of neat TPO samples with diesel-like char-
acteristics and efficiency. Engine control strategies have also been
demonstrated to mitigate viscosity effects for TPO, including ad-
vancement of injection timing (both main and pilot injection) and
increasing injection pressure. Both strategies are, however, limited
by the threat of spray wall-wetting. Note that viscosity control by
fuel pre-heating is a standard feature in flex-fuel marine diesel en-
gines capable of running on HFO.

Critical evaluation of available research related to engine oper-
ation on TPO reveals a clear lack of reliable information on non-
regulated emissions, even though it is an important issue in the
consideration  of  new  fuels.  A  notable  exception  is  the  work  by
Martínez et al. [180] , where a multi-compound Fourier transform
infra-red (FTIR) exhaust gas analyser was used. This study, how-
ever, used only 5% TPO admixture to DF, thus the differences in
emissions of most hydrocarbons, except aromatics, were below the
level  of  significance.  Naturally,  the  aromatics  content  in  exhaust
gas  are  inherited  from  fuel  composition.  The  same  effect  is  ex-
pected in the case of sulphur, both in terms of gaseous exhaust
components and PM  ́s chemical composition. There is a need for
detailed  emissions  speciation  when  TPO  is  considered  as  a  fuel
component.

In any observations regarding PM, it is important to point out
once again that most studies considered only smoke opacity: only
a  few  used  PM  concentration  measurement  and  sizing.  Refer  to
[180] for reliable information on PM distribution from TPO.

possible by adding the perspective of fuel properties and combus-
tion analysis. The number of works on engine emissions from TPO
that lack this context is, in fact, far greater than those reviewed
in Section 4 . Without a combustion perspective, the results from
various works  seem  contradictory,  making it  impossible to  draw
accurate conclusions. This arouses a general concern that incom-
plete works may lead to conclusions that have a possible negative
impact on the take-up and commercialisation of alternative fuels.
With this rather critical remark, we open the discussion about out-
look.

Outlook on TPO’s perspective
An underlying premise of this research is that waste tyres form
a considerable feedstock for fuel production, comparable to that of
biomass once food production has been prioritised. For instance,
considering the durability of the average car tyres of 70 0 0 0 km
and fuel consumption at a level of 7 dm 3 /100 km, a vehicle  ́s own
worn tyres can pay back 0.5% of the total fuel used.

The evidence considered in this review indicates that TPO has
sufficient quality to be used directly as bunkering fuel, though is-
sues  with  fuel-to-fuel  compatibility  would  have  to  be  resolved.
There is a fairly small gap between the quality of fuel from the cur-
rent state of the art in TPO production technology and the standard
set for automotive diesel fuels. Continued research along the sug-
gested lines should be capable of bridging that gap. To this end, the
research must become more multidisciplinary, merging the funda-
mental expertise in feedstock/fuel chemistry with applied knowl-
edge on pyrolysis technology.

The  requirement  for  sustainability  will  shift  future  fuels  to-
wards  more  complex  blends  accommodating  all  renewable  re-
sources.  Feedstock  co-utilisation  and  post-production  blending
strategies  should  be  developed  to  build  on  the  complementary
physicochemical parameters of individual feedstocks and/or fuels.
Blending  TPO  and  FAME/UCOME  have  been  suggested  here  as  a
good example of this complementary approach. Another potential
route is co-pyrolysis of waste tyres and biomass. According to the
present fuel quality and emissions review, an exemplary composi-
tion of 7% FAME / 7% (desulphurised) TPO/DTPO / 86% diesel could
be straightforwardly applied on the market, offering benefits over
the current B7 diesel. Other combinations, for instance, blending
TPO  with  HVO,  also  should  be  explored.  Progress  here  requires
methodological reinforcement in terms of chemical expertise and
predictive tools for modelling blended fuel properties and engine
performance.

Before  TPO-derived  or  any  other  pyrolytic  fuels  can  be  mar-
keted,  engine  manufacturers  must  accept  them,  which  in  turn,
means that more vehicle and engine tests using TPO blends should
be  picked  up  by  research  organisations.  The  bulk  of  engine  test
results with TPO involve legacy (basic) engines. Tests with mod-
ern (EU Stage V/Euro 6) engines are lacking. Furthermore, the twin
threats of PM and PAH are already identified as potential issues,
which  in  our  opinion  will  limit  the  application  of  TPO/DTPO  to
blends not exceeding 10%. There are many more pending emissions
issues for TPO applications that have not been addressed at all so
far. Unlegislated emissions need to be considered, especially with
respect to aldehydes and aromatics. TPO is expected to generate
higher  levels  of  both  of  these,  which  may  lead  to  imposition  of
additional constraints on TPO. Additionally, real driving emission
tests of vehicles fuelled with TPO should be performed. The effect
of TPO fuels on modern exhaust aftertreatment systems has been
hardly studied at all. Sulphur poisoning of diesel oxidation cata-
lysts is an obvious issue here, and there may be others. Catalyst
tests should be conducted in tandem with long-term durability en-
gine tests to check for potential deposit formation (injectors, valves
etc.) and performance deterioration over time.

As a final discussion note, it is necessary to say that construct-
ing this summary of emission trends related to TPO fuels was only

riod,  lacks  legislative  incentive  to  encourage  its  large-scale  up-
take  as  a  clean  and  efficient  way  to  use  waste  tyres.  Contin-
ued  lobbying  in  this  respect  is  required  to  transition  from  sim-
ple (but destructive) incineration of tyres towards more sustain-
able pyrolysis. Furthermore, the above pros and cons of pyrolytic
oil as a fuel component should be weighed against other possi-
ble  applications  for  TPO,  such  as  its  use  in  a  closed-loop,  tyre-
manufacturing process. This comparison should include factors like
process economy, well-to-wheel CO
2 footprint and local availabil-
ity.  It  should  also  assess  combinations  of  TPO  with  other  feed-
stock  in  fuel  and  tyre  producton  chains,  demanding  a  complex
decision-making equation. Multi-criteria decision-making using ar-
tificial  intelligence-based  approaches  would  allow  complex  data
from diferent sources to be merged with expert knowledge into
reasoned and unbiased decisions [ 223 , 224 ].

6. Conclusions

The objective of this work was to review the current status of
tyre pyrolytic oil in combustion engine applications. This fills an
important knowledge gap on the sustainability transition roadmap,
because the vision of how to best utilise waste tyres is not clear.
This  feedstock,  with  its  substantial  availability  and  good  heating
value, can contribute to solving the short-term fuel transition prob-
lem for off-road machinery, heavy-duty road vehicles and marine
transport. This review’s focus was on diesel engine applications be-
cause these are the prime-movers in these sectors.

To this end, this review answers the governing research ques-
tions related to TPO production and quality; post-processing and
quality  improvement  methods;  and  engine  validation  of  the  fi-
nal TPO-derived fuels. These questions are discussed in detail in
Section 5 . Below, we present the main conclusions drawn from the
discussion:

i TPO as waste-derived fuel has a negative GHG impact, removing
up to 1.6 kgCO
2 e/kg of waste tyres from the ecosystem. At the
same time, gross GHG emissions of TPO production are three
times lower than those of typical first-generation biofuels.

ii TPO  ́s future availability is comparable to that of vegetable oils
and  the  average  market  price  of  $350/10 0 0  kg  makes  it  the
cheapest sustainable fuel alternative, creating an incentive for
its  use  as  an  admixture  to  marine  and  off-road  fuel  supply
chains.

iii The current state of the art in tyre pyrolysis provides average
yields of crude oil of 50%, without any external energy input.
iv With nearly diesel-like lower heating value of approximately 41
MJ/kg., the properties of crude TPO technically enable direct fu-
elling of compression ignition engines.

v The  fuel  can  meet  the  low-sulphur  fuel  oil  standards  for
bunkering fuel and so can be used in all ships subject to the
IMO global sulphur cap (max 0.5% fuel sulphur content) with-
out needing scrubbers. The quality is insufficient for automo-
tive applications governed by the EN 590 diesel fuel standard
or corresponding US norms.

vi New  desulphurisation  technology,  such  as  the  ionic  solution
washing process, can reduce sulphur content below 0.1%. The
process  is  not  infrastructurally  demanding  and  supports  the
economics of distributed TPO production.

vii TPO viscosity can be tailored using distillation, but the trade-
off between  viscosity  and  flash  point  should  be  considered.
Fractional distillation should be targeted at a narrower boiling
range than currently exploited to avoid this trade-off.

viii The  limitations  of  viscosity,  flash  point,  sulphur  content  and
polyaromatic  hydrocarbons  fraction  narrow  down  automotive
applications of TPO/DTPO to low-level blends (up to 10%) with
mineral  diesel  and  other  fuels.  Mixtures  including  DTPO  and

FAME (or crude bio-oils) are most feasible since these fuels can
be compatible in viscosity, flash point and cold properties.
ix Emissions  are  an  important  constraint  for  TPO  fuel  applica-
tions. Its combustion-related effects can be mitigated either by
matching fuel properties or combustion control, but TPO is fun-
damentally  prone  to  emit  more  nitrogen  oxides,  CO,  unburnt
hydrocarbons  and  particulates  than  diesel  fuel.  However,  for
typical blends containing up to 10% TPO, the effects are rather
small  and  also  diminish  at  transient  engine  operation  under
real driving conditions.

x A  major  concern  of  using  TPO  is  associated  with  particulate
emissions, which scale up linearly with TPO content in the fuel.
The size distribution of the PM, and TPO’s substantial polyaro-
matic hydrocarbons content, which translates to PM  ́s chemical
composition, are also problematic due to their carcinogenic na-
ture.

xi Despite the above issues, the major hurdle for TPO remains the
waste tyre management legislation. Regulations in this sphere
fail to provide the necessary incentive for pyrolysis to compete
successfully with incineration. The economic and ecological fea-
sibility of TPO needs to be rigorously re-evaluated in the con-
temporary context of energy transition.

xii The present work puts forward the necessity of professionalisa-
tion of research in the field of TPO. Current infrastructural and
methodological commitment to this issue is too low when com-
pared to other fuel alternatives. Future endeavours should ulti-
mately become more multidisciplinary to address the apparent
disconnect between fundamental level research and TPO appli-
cations.

The above conclusions, complemented by exact numbers in the
adjoining  discussion,  aim  to  provide  an  unbiased  input  to  help
shape the future fuel roadmap for TPO. Accordingly, these conclu-
sions do not pre-judge the outcome of such work and so they do
not convey a final decision. That decision-making process should
weigh  TPO  against  different  feedstocks  available  for  sustainable
fuel production, and also against possible competing applications
of these feedstocks.
