Mathematical modelling 

Solid oxide cells are an exciting technology for energy conversion. Fuel cells, based on solid oxide tech- 
nology, convert hydrogen or hydrogen-rich fuels into electrical energy, with potential applications in sta- 
tionary power generation. Conversely, solid oxide electrolysers convert electricity into chemical energy, 
thereby offering the potential to store energy from transient resources, such as wind turbines and other 
renewable technologies. For solid oxide cells to displace conventional energy conversion devices in the 
marketplace, reliability must be improved, product lifecycles extended, and unit costs reduced. Math- 
ematical models can provide qualitative and quantitative insight into physical phenomena and perfor- 
mance, over a range of length and time scales. The purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with a 
summary of the state-of-the art of solid oxide cell models. These range from: simple methods based on 
lumped parameters with little or no kinetics to detailed, time-dependent, three-dimensional solutions for 
electric ﬁeld potentials, complex chemical kinetics and fully-comprehensive equations of motion based 
on effective transport properties. Many mathematical models have, in the past, been based on inaccu- 
rate property values obtained from the literature, as well as over-simplistic schemes to compute effective 
values. It is important to be aware of the underlying experimental methods available to parameterise 
mathematical models, as well as validate results. In this article, state-of-the-art techniques for measuring 
kinetic, electric and transport properties are also described. Methods such as electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy allow for fundamental physicochemical parameters to be obtained. In addition, effective 
properties may be obtained using micro-scale computer simulations based on digital reconstruction ob- 
tained from X-ray tomography/focussed ion beam scanning electron microscopy, as well as percolation 
theory. The cornerstone of model validation, namely the polarisation or current-voltage diagram, pro- 
vides necessary, but insuﬃcient information to substantiate the reliability of detailed model calculations. 
The results of physical experiments which precisely mimic the details of model conditions are scarce, and 
it is fair to say there is a gap between the two activities. The purpose of this review is to introduce the 
reader to the current state-of-the art of solid oxide analysis techniques, in a tutorial fashion, not only 
numerical and but also experimental, and to emphasise the cross-linkages between techniques.

1. Introduction 

Numerical modelling is critical for understanding the operation 
of  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  (SOFCs)  and  electrolysers  (SOEC)  due  to 
the highly coupled physics that occur at multiple time and length 
scales. The aim of this paper is to cover the state-of-the-art of solid 
oxide  cell  (SOC)  modelling,  so  as  to  provide  the  reader  with  an 
overview of  best  practices on  this  topic at  the continuum  scale. 
The paper covers relatively focussed aspects of SOC modelling, and 
so a number of related areas, such as elementary kinetics of elec- 
trochemical  reactions,  materials  modelling,  and  thermodynamic 
modelling  of  materials  and  interfacial  stability,  spatially-resolved 
microstructural modelling, system-level modelling are considered 
outside the scope of the review. Indeed, the challenge facing the 
modeller is to identify the important phenomena to be analysed 
in detail, as well as those which are less important. Successfully 
choosing the trade-off between representativeness and eﬃciency 
in the model is the key achievement in preparation for the set of 
processes to be simulated. This paper aims to provide a compre- 
hensive, critical review and practical guideline to facilitate a syner- 
getic approach towards the numerical simulation and experimental 
validation of SOCs. While covering the state-of-the art of modelling 
in this work, we have attempted to describe the assumptions made 
for each of the different physical phenomena treated. This is done 
by (i) introducing the overall development of modelling of SOCs; 
(ii) describing the best practices in continuum scale modelling; (iii) 
providing details on different approaches to modelling the different 
phenomena occurring at the microscale; and (iv) relating this to 
experimental approaches in an attempt to enumerate recommen- 
dations as to what researchers should address, combining models 
and experiments in a scientiﬁcally sound manner. The goal is tuto- 
rial; so that someone new to the ﬁeld can rapidly understand the 
current scope and limitations of SOC modelling. 

Physicochemical hydrodynamics [3] deals with the interaction 
between ﬂuid ﬂow and physical and chemical processes. SOCs are 
a classic example of such an interaction. As is noted in [ 4 , 5 ] 

“It is of the utmost importance to assign a clear objective to 
the model in order to correctly address the following trade-off
triad: generality, realism and precision.”

Richard Levins 

In other words, in the author’s opinion, it is impossible to create 
a model capable of simultaneously generating realistic and precise 
results for processes occurring at very different length and time 
scales.  Fig.  1  provides  an  overview  of  all  processes  taking  place 
in an SOC and their time constants/relaxation frequencies. These 
will be described in further detail in the chapters that follow. In 
the space/time domain, quantum mechanical phenomena occur at 
length/time  scales  of  below  1  nm/ns,  molecular  dynamics  mod- 
elling at scales of below 1 μm/μs. Continuum scale modelling in 
the  range  of  μm/μs  to  m/days  is  the  primary  focus  of  this  arti- 
cle. In the frequency domain, nanoscale charge transport processes 
are  on  the  order  of  GHz,  whereas  electrochemical  reactions  and 
charge  transfer  are  associated  with  frequencies  of  kHz.  A  range 
of scales of models (atomistic/elementary kinetics, microstructure 
based electrode models, cell and stack models, and ﬁnally, system 
models) exist. Each level of model typically requires closures from 
an order-of-magnitude smaller; so, for example a cell-level model 
requires  the  electronic  properties  of  the  electrodes  and  effective 
mechanical  property  values  to  be  prescribed.  These  may  be  ob- 
tained from sub-scale models based on digital reconstruction. Sim- 
ilarly, stack-level models need volume-averaged or ‘homogenised’ 
data, obtained from the cell level or from a single-repeating unit 
(SRU).  Therefore,  such  sub-scale  phenomena  are  also  considered

1.1. Solid oxide cells: Pathway of technology development 

The  SOFC  technology  enables  the  transformation  of  chemical 
energy stored in hydrocarbon and carbon-free fuels into electrical 
energy and heat with high eﬃciency via an electrochemical reac- 
tion. Moreover, if operated in reverse mode (i.e., consuming electri- 
cal power), these devices operate as electrolysers (SOECs), convert-

ing substances such as steam into chemical media. State-of-the-art 
SOCs operate in the temperature range of 600 to 10 0 0 °C, enabling 
the use of a wide range of fuels in fuel cell mode, and high tem- 
perature waste heat and high eﬃciency in electrolysis mode due to 
the fast electrode kinetics. With oxygen ions as the charge carrier 
in the electrolyte the technology also facilitates co-electrolysis of 
H 
2 , therefore becoming an attractive means for valoris- 
ing CO 

2 O and CO 
2 . 

1.1.1. SOC history and state-of-the-art 

2 O 

2  and  15%  Y 

The origins of SOCs can be traced to the 1890s, when Nernst 
developed  the  so-called  ‘Nernst  mass’  (85%  ZrO 
3 ) 
prototype of the present day anion-conducting electrolyte, pursu- 
ing the replacement of gas lighting by electric ﬁlaments [6] . How- 
ever, it was not until 1937 when Swiss scientists Baur and Preis 
[7] manufactured the ﬁrst SOFC prototype which, despite chemical 
instabilities between the electrolyte and electrodes, demonstrated 
that zirconia-based materials exhibit relatively high ionic conduc- 
tion at elevated temperatures (60 0-10 0 0 °C) [ 8 , 9 ]. SOEC technology 
attracted interest in the 1980s thanks to the studies of Donitz and 
Erdle [10] , who reported the ﬁrst SOEC results within the HotElly 
project using electrolyte-supported tubular cells [11] . 

1.1.2. SOC basic principles 

The SRU of an SOC is a solid state device consisting of porous 
positive (air) and negative (fuel/feedstock) electrodes, a solid elec- 
trolyte,  interconnects,  and  fuel  and  air  channels.  The  optimum 
thickness of the electrodes depends on the balance of transport of 
ions,  electrons,  and  gases  and  is  of  the  order  of  30-40  μm.  The 
electrolyte should in most cases be as thin as possible on a con- 
tinuum scale. However, for mechanical strength, one of the layers 
must be substantially thicker, in order for it to support the cell; 
either the electrolyte, or one of the electrodes, porous electrically- 
conducting support layers made of metal or cermet, e.g., Ni-3YSZ 
[12] . 

An electrode may be considered to be made of a chemically- 
active region and one or  more porous transport layers, used for 
gas  distribution  below  the  interconnect  contact  points,  conduc- 
tion  and/or  mechanical  strength.  These  additional  passive  layers 
are sometimes simply referred to as being part of the electrode, 
and  at  other  times  are  identiﬁed  as  separate  components.  The 
fuel  electrode  substrate  and  functional  layers  are  typically  fabri- 
cated with a porous nickel/yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) cermet. 
The  electrolyte  is  a  thin  layer  of  YSZ,  around  2-8  μm  in  thick- 
ness,  in  the  case  of  electrode-supported  cells,  or  80  to  200  μm 
where the electrolyte acts as mechanical support. A gadolinium- 
doped cerium-oxide layer is applied to the electrolyte prior to de- 
3- δ (LSCF) air electrodes to 
positing state-of-the-art (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O 
avoid the formation of zirconates (SrZrO 
3 ) due to inter-diffusion of 
air electrode constituents into the zirconia electrolyte layer. Much 
research and development are still ongoing in identifying new, al- 
ternative  material  combinations  for  the  SOC  active  components, 
but these lie outside the scope of this paper as they are focused 
on material compatibility issues and do not affect the basic elec- 
trochemical principles dealt with here. SOC fuel electrodes oxidise 
2 O (SOEC) at the boundaries where the gas, 
H 
ion- and electron-conducting phases meet. This region is known as 
the triple phase boundary (TPB) and is distributed throughout the 
whole electrode to maximise performance. Fig. 2 is an image ob- 
tained by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), wherein the core 
components described above are visible, also showing the different 
microstructures of each. 

2 (SOFC) or reduce H 

SRUs  of  planar  conﬁgurations  incorporate  high-temperature 
sealants that minimise fuel and air losses across the periphery. It is 
of vital importance that the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion of the 
different com ponents lie as close to each other as possible in order 

5 

to avoid undesired mechanical stresses that could potentially lead 
to the cracking of the cell or brittle interfaces, i.e., glass sealants 
and contact components between cell and interconnects. Further- 
more, chemical reactivity between neighbouring elements should 
be minimal so as to avoid material degradation. 

Two principal SOC geometries are to be found: planar and tubu- 
lar. The main advantage of tubular SOCs over planar is that they 
intrinsically conﬁne gases in a highly eﬃcient manner due to the 
strongly reduced edge-to-active area ratio, hence there is less need 
to employ high temperature seals. This allows for more rapid tran- 
sient  operations,  as  well  as  greater  structural  robustness  during 
long-term operation. Micro-tubular SOCs, brought to light in the 
late 1990s [13] , have generated higher power densities than their 
larger counterparts, besides being highly resistant to thermal cy- 
cling. However, an eﬃcient current collection and interconnection 
between tubular-shaped cells to form a stack remains critical is- 
sues [14] . 

Fig.  3  illustrates  an  example  of  a  planar  SOC  geometry,  pro- 
duced as thin, ﬂat plates enabling a compact series connection of 
these to form a stack. The advantages of planar geometry are lower 
manufacturing costs and higher power densities than for tubular 
cells. Nonetheless, planar SOCs feature drawbacks that must be ad- 
dressed to guarantee a high-quality product in the long term: they 
require strong gas-tight seals to separate fuel and air streams and 
to bond the stack components together. Furthermore, the ﬂow dis- 
tribution and thermal gradients across the planar stacks can cause 
mechanical stresses, which may result in failure when ceramic ma- 
terials are employed. 

Different planar stack designs are commercially available 1 . The 
earlier SOFC stack designs were cross-ﬂow designs, and the mani- 
folds could easily be externally located. The challenge with cross- 
ﬂow  is  the  very  uneven  temperature  distribution  with  one  cold 
corner at the intersect of the two inlets, and a hot corner at the 
junction of the two outlets [15] . The uneven temperature distri- 
bution will result in high thermo-mechanical stresses and uneven 
operating conditions across the stack, especially when operated in 
fuel  cell  mode  of  operation.  Some  commercial  cross-ﬂow  stacks 
are still available today e.g., the all-ceramic monolithic stack from 
Saint-Gobain,  and  the  large  stacks  from  FuelCell  Energy  (Versa 
Power). 

Stacks  with  unidirectional  ﬂow  may  include  counter  and  co- 
ﬂow; the former tends to have a slightly warmer centre and higher 
thermal  stresses  than  the  latter  [16] ,  which  is  why  the  latter  is 
typically chosen in modern commercial designs. Due to the need 
to cool the stacks, the rate of air ﬂow in a SOFC is much larger 
than that required stoichiometrically, typically by a factor of 5-10, 
depending  on  the  current  density.  To  distribute  the  ﬂow  evenly 
across all cells in the stack, the inlet and outlet pressure for each 
cell should be nominally equal [17] , calling for large vertical man- 
ifold channels. This can be achieved by having channels internal 
to  the  stack,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Mark  F  design  ( Fig.  3 ).  Most 
manufacturers prefer an external manifold on the air side, as in 
SOLIDpower, Sunﬁre and Haldor Topsoe stack designs, rather than 
building large channels into the stack. Some manufacturers have 
the fuel manifolds in the line of the air ﬂow ﬁeld within the stack 
(Sunﬁre, Haldor Topsoe), whereas others place the fuel manifolds 
on the side of the stack, so that they do not obstruct the air ﬂow 
(SOLIDpower, Elcogen). The latter strategy makes a very even ﬂow- 
ﬁeld distribution possible, for both fuel and air; as high as 95 % 
fuel utilisation have been demonstrated yielding a high eﬃciency 
of 75% (based on lower heating values) in SOFC operation [ 18 , 19 ]. 
The cells are typically mounted in a cassette. The cassettes are sub-

SOCs use electrochemical reactions for the inter-conversion of 
electrical  and  chemical  energy.  This  involves  reduction  and  oxi- 
dation of the reagents on either side of the electrochemical cell. 
The anode is deﬁned as the electrode where the oxidation reaction 
takes place, generating surplus electrons, whereas the cathode is 
deﬁned as the electrode where the reduction reaction takes place, 
consuming electrons. In fuel cell mode, fuel is oxidised at the fuel 

electrode (i.e., converting hydrogen into water) and is thus called 
the anode. This oxidation reaction generates electrons that nega- 
tively charge the electrode. In electrolysis mode, however, the neg- 
ative charge is given by the external voltage source, which ‘pushes 
out’ the electrons from the reagents, effectively reducing their state 
(i.e.,  splitting  water  to  hydrogen  and  oxygen  ions)  and  thus  the 
‘fuel’ electrode, still negatively charged, is by deﬁnition the cath- 
ode. It is to be noted that for SOCs, the material combinations of 
the active components (electrodes and electrolyte) generally do not 
need to  change despite  the inversion of  polarity.  The electrolyte 

6 

S.B. Beale, M. Andersson, C. Boigues-Muñoz et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100902 

remains  a  conductor  of  oxygen  ions  that  interact  with  the  elec- 
trons at the oxygen (positive) electrode, and the hydrogen (nega- 
tive) electrode catalyses the steam reduction process in electrolysis 
mode as it does hydrogen oxidation in fuel cell mode. That is why 
many processes discussed in this work are fundamentally equiva- 
lent for the two modes. The long-term effects of cell degradation 
are different however, since this often entails a demixing of elec- 
trode constituents, the ‘direction’ of which is inﬂuenced by the po- 
larity of operation. Also, the more strongly oxidizing atmosphere 
at the fuel electrode in electrolysis operation can cause accelerated 
nickel agglomeration and volatilization compared to fuel cell mode. 
To avoid the ambiguity of the terms anode and cathode in SOCs, 
which can operate as either fuel cells or electrolysers, it is neces- 
sary to refer to ‘fuel/feedstock’ or ‘negative’ electrodes on the one 
hand, and to ‘air’ or ‘positive’ electrodes, on the other. In this pa- 
per, the negative electrode is generally referred to as ‘fuel’ and the 
positive  electrode  as  ‘air’,  fully  recognising  that  for  electrolysers 
the fuel is, in fact, feedstock, and that the composition of the ox- 
idant may differ to that of atmospheric air. Fig. 3 is an ‘exploded 
view’ of a planar SOC, based on the Jülich Mark-F geometry. Stacks 
of this type have operated for over 90 0 0 0 hours without failure. 
Fuel and air are introduced to individual cells from the manifolds 
via gas passages. Air ﬂows through micro-channels machined be- 
tween the ‘ribs’ of the air electrode-side of the steel interconnec- 
tor (see Fig. 3 , inset). The ribs provide electrical contact between 
the electrodes and the porous air electrode. On the fuel side there 
are no ribs; rather, the fuel ﬂows within the open frame. (Because 
Fig. 3 is an ‘exploded diagram’, the electrolyte,  which is located 
within the frame, appears to have been extruded or offset outside 
of the region.) Metallic contact between the interconnect and an- 
ode is achieved by a Ni-mesh (not shown), which is spot-welded 
to the interconnect plate. This provides a low resistance electrical 
connection with the anode substrate and also serves to distribute 
the fuel gas over the region, by inducing mixing. This particular de- 
sign is a counter-ﬂow conﬁguration. Numerous modelling studies 
and experimental measurements have shown that, in general, the 
counter-ﬂow conﬁguration exhibits the best performance in terms 
of maximum electric potential, power density and cell eﬃciency, 
further discussed below. Co-ﬂow generally has the lowest perfor- 
mance, but exhibits a more uniform temperature and current den- 
sity distributions, and is therefore often preferred. The cross-ﬂow 
conﬁguration with intermediate performance can have signiﬁcant 
undesirable gradients in terms of temperature and current density. 

1.1.3. Modelling and physical experiments 

The experimental optimisation of SOC stacks is costly, as ideally 
multiple nominally identical stacks must be tested under the same 
conditions, at high temperatures, to ensure that small production 
variations or inconsistent in testing conditions are not the reason 
for observed failures or discrepancies in performance. Furthermore, 
post-mortem analyses of failed stacks can be challenging, as detri- 
mental conditions often cause accelerating effects, such as heating 
due to the direct combustion of a cracked cell or sealant, and the 
initial cause of failure is not directly observable. Despite these dif- 
ﬁculties, experimental characterisation and validation are the best 
ways  to  concretely  prove  the  potential  of  SOC  cell/stack  assem- 
blies. Different cross-correlating methods to monitor both cells and 
stacks are valuable in the development of the technology. These in- 
clude local probing, current-voltage characteristics, and impedance 
spectroscopy. The cost of experiments must be considered in the 
development of the technology. Numerical simulation is a tool for 
predicting  the  physical  phenomena  occurring  in  the  microstruc- 
ture of the cells, in the cells themselves, and when operating an 
SOC stack. However, modelling requires a large number of physical 
parameters to be known for the set of governing equations to be 
solved, and these are rarely well-deﬁned in a complex, compound 

system such as an SOC. Often, ideal values are used for fundamen- 
tal parameters, such as a reaction order or pre-exponential factor, 
for example (see section 2), or values are taken from the litera- 
ture  without  questioning their  applicability. Being able to  assess 
the real values of these parameters for a given SOC architecture or 
material combination would allow the models to be more accurate 
in their representativeness, and increase conﬁdence in their predic- 
tions of phenomena that cannot be measured. It is therefore cru- 
cial that efforts to test, characterise and validate cells and stacks be 
accurately synchronised with mathematical modelling of the phe- 
nomena and processes that make up the physical objects. Only in 
this way is it possible to properly understand and ultimately con- 
trol  and  design the  behaviour and  performance of  the  SOC,  and 
thus more coherently and conﬁdently sustain the market deploy- 
ment of this high-potential technology for energy conversion. 

1.2. Common analysis tools and techniques 

Below,  the  basic  experimental  characterisation  tools,  which 
yield the most common data used for technology assessment and 
model  validation,  are  brieﬂy  described.  In-depth  description  and 
detailed guidelines for all SOC testing procedures can be found in 
the literature [ 20 , 21 ]. Furthermore, in section 3 of this review, spe- 
ciﬁc techniques are discussed in greater depth. 

1.2.1. Global performance characterisation: Polarisation curves 

The polarisation curve is the ubiquitous expression for fuel cell 
and electrolyser performance at the cell and stack levels. Cell volt- 
age, V , is plotted as a function of current density 2 , i”. The open 
circuit or Nernst potential, E , occurs at equilibrium i” = 0. Fig. 4 (a) 
shows a polarisation curve for a single SOC operating in both fuel 
cell, i” ≥ 0, and electrolyser, i” ≤ 0, modes. It can be seen that the 
voltage decreases as the current density increases in a relatively 
linear  manner.  Generally  speaking,  for  fuel  cell  mode,  the  low, 
intermediate  and  high  current-density  regions  are  frequently  re- 
ferred to as activation, ohmic and concentration areas where losses 
are primarily due to charge-transfer kinetics, electrical resistance 
and  mass  transport,  respectively.  SOCs  are  high-temperature  de- 
vices and, for this reason, activation losses are relatively small: the 
decrease in voltage as i” increases from zero is due to thermody- 
namic, not kinetic factors: When the fuel employed is dry hydro- 
gen, as is further discussed below, the production of water by the 
reaction leads to a reduction in the thermodynamically-maximum 
potential, E . When testing and rating fuel cells, an important pa- 
rameter is the utilisation, εu , deﬁned for both air and fuel as the 
ratio of the fuel/oxidant consumed to the maximum possible value 
(usually the respective bulk inlet ﬂow). This may be deﬁned, as the 
mass of air/fuel consumed by the reaction to the inlet supply: 

ε u =

It is common in electrochemical texts to denote the current density with the 
symbol J (to distinguish from current i ) and potential by the symbol U . However, in 
this text the convention of Jacob is employed, whereby a ‘dash’ denotes a spatial 
derivative and a ‘dot’ a temporal derivative. Thus, i (cid:3) (cid:3) 
denotes current density (A/m 2 
) 
and i (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3) 
A/m 3 
. The symbol E denotes ideal or Nernst potential and the symbol, V , the 
cell voltage. 

Use of the subscript index ‘ i ’ is avoided in all expressions which include terms 

in current, i or current density i ʺ.

number of charged particles associated with the reaction, F is Fara- 
day’s constant, and i is the total current. Eq. (2) , is referred-to as 
Faraday’s second law of electrolysis. When performing a polarisa- 
tion test, both the fuel/air (fuel cell) and water (electrolyser) utili- 
sations can be maintained constant down to some minimum reac- 
tion rate (current). This is typically achieved by adjusting the ﬂow 
rates. However, in air-cooled SOFCs, the air ﬂow is generally ad- 
justed to ensure adequate cooling of the cell (see section 2.7.9) and 
the fuel ﬂow is also commonly ﬁxed, rather than varied. Therefore, 
for fuel cell mode, the utilisation increases as the current density 
increases, and a limiting current may be approached whereby mass 
transfer is limited by oxygen starvation (not readily apparent on 
the right side of Fig. 4 ). Similarly for electrolysers, feedstock star- 
vation is clearly seen on the left side of Fig. 4 . 

Utilisation may also be deﬁned in terms of outlet values: 

ε u = 1 − ˙ m out

where  ρ is  mixture  density,  and  y 
i  is  mass  fraction  for  species 
i (section 2.3), and u and A are inlet/exit velocity and area vec- 
tors. Eqs. (1) and (3) will only lead to identical values, when the 
ﬂow Reynolds numbers, Re = u D H /ν, where D 
h  is a hydraulic di- 
ameter  and  ν kinematic  viscosity,  or,  more  correctly,  the  Péclet 
numbers, Pe = u D H /D where D is diffusivity, are suﬃciently high. 

Otherwise the individual species velocity does not equate with the 
i |  (cid:6) =  | u |  and  Eq.  (4)  is  incorrect.  Calculations  for 
overall  value,  | u 
the 1996 International Energy Agency (IEA) SOFC benchmark [23] , 
with hydrogen as a fuel, suggest that for the fuel side, Re < 1, so 
Eqs. (1) and (3) computed this way do not give consistent values 
[ 24 , 25 ]. Under the circumstances, for both numerical and physical 
experiments,  ˙ m must  be  obtained suﬃciently  far away from the 
SOC, so that diffusion is negligible. The same situation is also true 
for heat metering at low ﬂow rates. 

1.2.2. In-depth process characterisation: Electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy 

The polarisation curves of SOCs can only provide the total over- 
potential at a given operating point. Information about the differ- 
ent underlying loss mechanisms in the cathode, electrolyte, anode 
and their interfaces do not emerge. These are, however, essential 
for understanding the cell performance for a targeted optimisation 
of the cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a com- 
mon approach to gain such information, utilising the dynamics of 
the underlying physicochemical processes in the cell. 

Electronic  and  ionic  conduction,  charge  transfer  at  interfaces, 
catalytic reactions, and gas diffusion in porous electrodes are time- 
dependent processes, resulting in capacitive behaviour in addition 
to a contribution to the internal resistance of the cell. These are re- 
lated to the permittivities, space charge layers or chemical capac- 
ities, which by their nature yield characteristic responses to sinu- 
soidal excitation. In EIS, a frequency sweep of excitation current or 
voltage is applied to the SOC (from around 100 kHz to around 0.1 
Hz, at logarithmically-spaced intervals) and the response (in volt-

of the impedance spectra yields information about the critical pro- 
cesses for the SOC in long term operation.

In the simplest case, the electrical behaviour of process k can 
be  described by  an equivalent circuit  consisting  of  its  resistance 
k , where the dynamics of the process 
R

are represented by the time constant, τ
k (cid:2)C 
k = R 
k or the relaxation 
k ) −1 . To model the dynamics of physicochem- 
frequency, f 
ical processes in SOCs, more complex equivalent circuits are usu- 
ally applied and EIS is used as a tool to identify and quantify the 
associated parameters. The theory is discussed in impedance spec- 
troscopy handbooks, such as those by Macdonald [26] , Barsoukov 
and Macdonald [27] , Orazem and Tribollet [28] and Lasia [29] , to- 
gether with practical hints. 

Fig. 1 provides an overview of the time constants/relaxation fre- 
quencies. A single EIS measurement will generate aggregate infor- 
mation about the electrochemical charge transfer processes, mass 
transfer, and chemical reactions. 

It is essential that the EIS measurement settings, the test bench 
and  cell,  satisfy  the  conditions  of  linearity,  causality,  and  time- 
invariance.  SOCs  couple  very  diverse  mechanisms,  making  them 
nonlinear  systems;  nevertheless,  if  the  excitation  signal  is  small 
AC < 20 mV), the response can be presumed to 
enough (usually V 

9 

be linear. Causality and time-invariance are more critical require- 
ments that can be impacted by the test bench (harmonics of the 
AC power line, drift or oscillation of the gas ﬂows, or fuel humid- 
iﬁcation) and the stability of the cell. Practical guidelines for the 
EIS-measurements of SOCs can be found in Klotz et al. [30] and 
in the IEC 62282-8-1 Standard on test procedures for SOCs (to be 
issued in 2020). A method to evaluate the measured spectra is de- 
scribed in Schönleber et al. [31] and the related software is avail- 
able online [32] . 

The interpretation of electrochemical impedance spectra is of- 
ten  hampered  by  the  complexities  of  the  phenomena  and  their 
overlap in the frequency domain. Neither Nyquist nor Bode plots, 
see  Fig.  5 ,  are  capable  of  displaying  distinctly  the  different  loss 
mechanisms in an SOC. 

Recently developed mathematical approaches [ 33 , 34 ] have suc- 
ceeded in obtaining a distribution of relaxation times (DRT) from 
the  EIS  spectrum,  enabling  the  deconvolution  of  the  different, 
compound  processes.  On  the  basis  of  this  information,  physico- 
chemically-meaningful  equivalent  circuit  models  can  be  set  up 
wherein each circuital element represents an identiﬁed process, as 
shown in Fig. 6 . 

Once a generally valid model is obtained, dedicated ﬁtting al- 
gorithms can then approximate the resistance and capacitance val- 
ues of each element in the equivalent circuit [ 35 , 37 ]. Through re- 
arrangement  of  the  governing  equations,  quantiﬁcation  can  take 
place for the fundamental physical and chemical parameters that 
must  be  used  in  the  mechanistic  models  (see  section  3.3).  This 
is a crucial step in the transfer of experimental measurements to 
process and component modelling, avoiding excessive reliance on 
sources  of  literature  that  are  unclear  or  unquestioned  in  terms 
of reliability or applicability. This enables closer collaboration be- 
tween  experimental  and  simulation  experts,  whereby  the  latter

require  accurate  data  on  which  to  build  their  models,  while 
the former require physically-sound veriﬁcation of their measure- 
ments. 

Nevertheless,  many  unsatisfactory  EIS  models  are  still  em- 
ployed. It is quite common to set up equivalent circuits based on a 
larger number of elements, which can easily be ﬁtted to any mea- 
sured spectrum. An excellent agreement of a small series of mea- 
surements with the model does not guarantee the correctness of 
the model (as any additional equivalent circuit element added to 
the model  will further decrease the model  error)  and the inter- 
pretation of the various ﬁtted values is debatable. A more rigor- 
ous approach using physico-chemically-meaningful models is rec- 
ommended where all, or at least most, of the model parameters 
can be determined independently without ﬁtting, as successfully 
applied in the work of Dierickx et al. [38] . 

A different approach to understand electrochemical processes in 
the cell using impedance spectroscopy, is based on elementary ki- 
netic modelling. Impedance spectra can be simulated by means of 
elementary kinetic models, i.e., the spectra (as well as DC polar- 
isation curves) can be calculated using appropriate sets of trans- 
port and reaction equations as described in Bessler et al. [39-41] . 
Despite their complexity, such models can reproduce experimental 
data and correlate features of the spectra to physicochemical pro- 
cesses in the cell. 

1.2.3. Characterisation of state: Gas composition, pressure and 
temperature measurements 

Besides the characterisation of the electrical performance of the 
SOC cell/stack assembly, in experimental programmes of research, 
it is important to accurately monitor and record the temperatures 
of the test specimens, as these can greatly inﬂuence response. Con- 
ditions in an experimental set-up will necessarily be different to 
those  in  an  autonomous,  ﬁeld-tested  or  commercially  operating 
system. Short stacks and single cells are tested in furnaces that im- 
pact the operating temperature inside the cell/stack housing and 
provide different boundary conditions to those in large insulated 
stacks that generate suﬃcient heat to be thermally self-sustaining. 
However,  in  contrast  to  a  closed  ‘end-use’  system,  experimental 
rigs offer the possibility of introducing a number of thermocou- 
ples in key places where real measurement can be of vital impor- 
tance to gaining proper insight into the occurring operando pro- 
cesses.  The  electrolyte  temperature  can  also  be  inferred,  based 
on the temperature dependence of its high frequency impedance 
[42] . 

It is very important that in experimental setups there be ade- 
quate pre-heating of the reactants to the nominal operating tem- 
perature of the stack or cell. The gas temperature should be mea- 
sured at the inlet and outlet of the cell/stack by using thermocou- 
ples placed in the gas stream near the electrode gas supply/exit 
port  of  the  cell/stack  assembly  unit.  Thermocouples  should  be 
placed, where accessible on the cell/stack: this means at least in 

connection with the end plates that enclose the tested unit, but 
more invasive measurement can give better ideas as to the temper- 
ature distribution across the cell surface area from inlet-to-outlet. 
Temperature  inhomogeneity  is  one  of  the  most  important  rea- 
sons for SOC degradation. As regards the localised measurement of 
temperature, innovative approaches have been demonstrated lately 
at cell level, such as the one employed by Silva-Mosqueda et al. 
[43] in which thermocouples were distributed in the X and Y axes 
of  the  fuel  electrode  of  a  single  cell  and  temperature  gradients 
were obtained in 2-dimensions. This solution is analogous to the 
one proposed by Guk et al. [44] for measuring the temperature in 
the air electrode. At the stack level, Tallgren et al. [45] proposed 
an  indirect  method  to  monitor  temperature  distributions  of  cell 
clusters by using EIS measurements. However this method cannot 
be used to measure temperature gradients at the electrode level. 
Some information about temperature measurement may be found 
in [46-49] . In principle the thermocouples can be also inserted di- 
rectly into the air channels. The risk of short circuit and leakage 
through the sealant (in the case of a closed manifold) is high, but 
the measurement is possible. This is easier for stacks with open air 
manifolds. Yan et al. [50] consider the use of optical ﬁber sensors 
to gather temperature information 

As concerns the water content in the cell/stack when tested in 
a laboratory furnace, cold-spots may become an issue when em- 
ploying  prototype  housings  or  test  rigs  enabling  localised  spot- 
samplings  of  gas  composition  in  real-sized  specimens,  especially 
when  the  measuring  equipment  is  placed  outside  the  furnace 
at  ambient  temperature.  A  sound  management  of  temperature 
is  important  to  control  steam  content,  and  avoid  condensation 
which  in  turn  may  lead  to  undesirable  local  pressure  gradients 
[51] . 

Gas  composition  measurement  is  important  when  compound 
gases are utilised, such as reformate (in SOFCs) or in co-electrolysis 
(in SOECs). The electrode gas composition should be sampled near 
the  electrode  gas  supply  and/or  exit  port  and  analysed,  for  ex- 
ample, using infrared spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and/or gas 
chromatography. At the air electrode, oxidant concentration can be 
measured using an amperometric lambda sensor. The gas sample 
should be transported from origin to point-of-analysis in a manner 
that minimises changes in composition (i.e., short heated sampling 
lines). Water content can be diﬃcult to manage, as many analysis 
instruments do not tolerate condensed water. 

Finally, reactant pressure ﬂuctuations can also give rise to sig- 
niﬁcant alterations of the recorded cell voltage. It is good practice 
to measure the differential pressures between the inlet and out- 
let of each electrode and water condensation at the outlet should 
again be carefully managed to avoid backpressure effects. A pres- 
sure sensor, manometer, Bourdon tube, or similar instrument may 
be employed. The measuring instrument should be located in such 
a manner that the uncertainty is minimised with respect to any 
pressure loss within the piping.

1.2.4. In-situ characterisation: Segmented cells and local probing 

Many characterisation techniques are applied to the entire cell 
(or stack) and do not take into account the spatial differences of 
local conditions in an operating cell. There will always be a proﬁle 
of conditions (through the electrochemical reactions and associated 
cell response) from the inlet to the outlet of the reagents fed to the 
cell. It is exactly this differential of state over the thin plane of the 
cell that can lead to locally-critical conditions (hot spots, fuel star- 
vation, nickel reoxidation, mechanical stress, etc.) that cannot be 
detected in a “black box” set-up such as an average test facility. To 
overcome this, so-called segmented cells and stacks have been de- 
veloped for individual assessment of the different zones across an 
operating SOC. Here, the air electrode layer is printed as mutually- 
electrically insulated segments over the entire cell area, allowing 
the ability to individually measure distinct areas of the cell and 
the electrical response of each in the overall ﬂow ﬁeld. Being able 
to carry out EIS and subsequent deconvolution via DRT analysis on 
all segments allows for monitoring of the degradation rates asso- 
ciated with each  electrochemical process as  distributed over the 
active area of the cell, see Fig. 7 . 

Other laboratories have developed test set-ups where local gas 
and temperature measurements can be taken, in-operando , to map 
the evolution of chemical reactions across the active cell area in 
steady-state and transient conditions [ 54 , 55 ]. These techniques add 
considerable information to the local conditions determining the 
electrochemical performance of, and degradation in SOCs, and can 
be used to generate statistical multivariate models correlating lo- 
calised conditions with global settings, as well as to validate CFD 
models. 

1.2.5. Optical in-situ characterisation 

Another approach to obtaining spatially resolved measurements 
from within an operating SOC is to employ optical methods, ob- 
taining  non-intrusive  in-situ  experimental  data  of  the  occurring 
phenomena.  Pioneering  work  in  this  respect  was  carried  out  by 
Lu et al. [56] . The simple mapping of temperature distribution and 
variation of the optically exposed electrode, for derivation of the 
reactions occurring and identiﬁcation of hot spots can be carried 
out by infra-red imaging [ 57 , 58 ], but chemical analysis of formed 
species; either on the surface, or in the reacting gas phase requires 
the utilisation of Raman spectroscopy [59] . To facilitate optical ac- 
cess, the test section is closed off with quartz material, and then 
placed in a furnace with appropriate openings for both the laser 
light  source  and  the  optical  sensor.  In  addition  to  the  accurate 
alignment of the laser beam, care must be taken not to damage the 
transparent section, as well as not to generate reﬂection noise. Ad- 
equate sealing can be a major challenge, due to the fragility of the 
glass surface and the high temperatures acting on different mate- 
rials in the set-up. For these reasons, most work to-date has been 
on button cells, though more recent studies have also considered 

for channels, thus monitoring the evolution of the reactant com- 
position [ 60 , 61 ]. Though a highly artiﬁcial environment, by nature, 
due to the complexity of the experimental set-up for optical in-situ 
measurement, the resulting data can be particularly useful for val- 
idating detailed models of reforming and SOC oxidation/reduction 
processes. 

1.3. History of continuum scale SOC modelling 

The  operation  of  an  SOC-stack  is  driven  by  a  number  of 
complex, interconnected phenomena occurring at multiple length 
scales and in different parts of the cell, as shown in Fig. 8 . It is 
impossible to experimentally examine microscale phenomena tak- 
ing  place  in  a  porous  electrode  structure  inside  the  stack.  Even 
operando methods such as impedance spectroscopy average over 
the cell area and cannot describe local phenomena. In this sense, 
numerical modelling, including coupled electrical and electrochem- 
ical,  thermal,  ﬂuid  dynamics  and  mechanical  sub-models,  is  be- 
coming an ever more crucial tool for the prediction of global and 
local  physical  phenomena  within  the  different  parts  of  the  cell 
[62] .  For  instance,  the  current-density  distribution  in  a  cell,  the 
temperature gradient in a stack, or gas concentration in an elec- 
trode are diﬃcult to obtain experimentally, but can readily be pre- 
dicted in a model study. 

In this respect, the primary focus of the present paper encom- 
passes the state-of-the-art and best practices related to the mod- 
elling of SOCs at the continuum scale level, which reduces to single 
cells, SRUs and stacks, with some attention to micro-scale work. 
While signiﬁcant development in modeling detailed electrochem- 
istry done over the past 20 years are recognized, beginning with 
the  pioneering work  of  the  Gauckler  group  on  model  electrodes 
and their mechanisms, see Bieberle and Gaukler [ 63 ], continuing 
with an international group of scientists developing elementary ki- 
netic models (in alphabetical order: Adler, Bessler, Deutschmann, 
Goodwin, Jackson, Kee, and others) see DeCaluwe et al. [ 64 ] and 
references therein, culminating in the ongoing development of the 
open-source chemistry software, Cantera [ 65 , 66 ]. In single cell to 
stack modelling detailed reaction kinetics [ 67 ] and elementary ki- 
netic electrode models [ 64 ] have to be simpliﬁed to reduce com- 
puting  time.  As  we  are  focusing  on  continuum  scale  models  in 
this review, modelling on an elementary kinetic electrode or even 
model-electrode  level  will  not  be  considered.  It  is  important  to 
note that these simpler types of models have already been con- 
ﬁrmed to be suitable for engineering design optimisation purposes 
while limiting the amount of testing required for veriﬁcation. For 
instance, Peksen et al. [ 68 , 69 ] used a 3-D model of an SOFC stack 
to improve the design of the pre-heaters, while Rashid et al. [ 70 ] 
modelled several manifold designs of a ﬂat-tubular SOFC stack con- 
verging  towards  an  optimal  geometry  capable  of  increasing  the 
nominal stack power by 8%. Bi et al. [ 71 ] identiﬁed a key geometric

design parameter to improve the ﬂow uniformity of the planar SOC 
stack by CFD simulations of the ﬂow ﬁelds in the SOC stacks. Liu 
et al. [ 72 ] used a model to analyse the trade-off between ohmic 
and concentration overpotentials and proposed an interconnected 
rib design to improve output. Chen et al. [ 73 ] were able to dimin- 
ish concentration losses of an SOFC SRU by analysing different in- 
terconnect designs using a CFD model, together with the Taguchi 
method. 

The 1990s witnessed the advent of the ﬁrst CFD-based fuel cell 
models incorporating ﬂuid ﬂow phenomena coupled with electro- 
chemistry. These were relatively simple and 1-D, and it was not 
until 1994 that a transient 3-D model of an SOFC was developed 
by Achenbach et al . [74] . Ferguson et al . [24] studied the effects of 
heat and mass transfer in a planar SOFC by means of temperature- 
dependent empirical mathematical expressions, while Bessette et 
al. [75] veriﬁed that extrapolating results obtained from the nu- 
merical model of an SOFC SRU to predict the outputs for a stack 
is imprecise, as was subsequently conﬁrmed by Beale and Zhubrin 
[76] . Chan et al. [77] developed a model with the Butler-Volmer 
equation, Eq. (64) , below. In 2003, Recknagle et al. [78] developed 
an  SOFC  stack  model  with  an  empirical  electrochemistry  model 
and used it to study the effects of ﬂow conﬁguration on the tem- 
perature  distribution  and  power  output  of  a  1-cell  planar  SOFC 
stack. Khaleel et al. [79] illustrated a ﬁnite element method (FEM)- 
based SOFC model for analysing a methane-fuelled 30-cell stack, 
with simpliﬁed ﬂuid-electrochemical-chemical modelling. 

Khaleel et al. [80] outlined a multiscale electrochemistry mod- 
elling  scheme  by  considering  the  effect  of  electrode  microstruc- 
ture  on  electrochemical performance at  the  continuum  level.  Ja- 
nardhanan and Deutschmann [ 81 , 82 ] introduced a heterogeneous 
multistep mechanism for steam reforming of methane, hydrogen 
and carbon monoxide in the Ni/YSZ electrode of an SOC. This ap- 

proach has been used by other groups, Zhu et al. [83] . Kim et al. 
[84] proposed a multiscale materials modelling method by consid- 
ering the effects of microstructure evolution on effective material 
properties and SOFC performance at the continuum scale. Shi et al. 
[85] developed a 2-D model, capable of considering the effects of 
heterogeneous electrode properties. 

The  development  of  3-D  multi-cell  stack  models  with  realis- 
tic  geometric details is another major effort f or  enhancing SOFC 
continuum modelling capability. Beale and Zhubrin [76] presented 
a stack model based on volume-averaging which the authors re- 
ferred  to  as  a  distributed  resistance  analogy.  Sudaprasert  et  al. 
[86]  developed  a  multi-physics-coupled  stack  model  to  simulate 
the operations of a 5-cell SOFC stack, but the cell size was rela- 
tively  small.  More  recently  multi-physics models  for  production- 
scale SOFC stacks have been successfully developed [87-89] . Li et 
al. [90] performed multi-physics simulations of the operations of 
a 30-cell stack with an electrochemically-active area of 144 cm 2 
in a single cell. Nishida et al. [89] presented a multi-physics stack 
model with extensive experimental validation on an 18-cell stack 
with an effective electrode area of 361 cm 2 . 

With the growing number of papers on modelling of SOCs, re- 
view papers started to appear. Kakaç et al. [91] published a com- 
prehensive  review  on  the  activities  of  SOFC  macro-modelling  in 
20 07. In 20 08, Colpan et al. [92] presented another literature sur- 
vey and pointed out the need to increase model accuracy. Updates 
on the progress of SOFC modelling continued to appear [93-97] . 
Andersson et al. [93] made a review on the development of mul- 
tiscale  chemical  reactions  coupled  with  transport  phenomena  in 
SOFCs. Grew and Chiu [97] presented a review on numerical tech- 
niques and their applicability across the length and time-scales for 
SOFC modelling. In 2015 Peksen [98] considered thermomechanical 
modelling in SOFCs.

Recent reviews on SOFC modelling includes the work by Bao et 
al. [99] on the model-based control of SOFC-gas turbine hybrid sys- 
tems, as well as the work by Zabihian and Fung [100] that explains 
the fundamental bases behind different modelling approaches. In 
the ﬁeld of mesoscale modelling, recent development focuses on 
methodologies for porous media, electrochemistry etc., for exam- 
ple, the work by Torabi et al. [101] that describes recent develop- 
ment of the second law investigations and analyses in thermal and 
chemical porous media systems. The work by Ryan and Mukher- 
jee  [102]  describes  the  challenges,  state-of-the-art  and  path  for- 
ward in mesoscale electrochemical energy systems modelling, see 
Fig. 1 , and their application to various design and operational is- 
sues in SOFCs, PEFCs, lithium ion batteries as well as metal-air bat- 
teries. Tjaden et al. [103] review a diverse range of methods that 
have been developed to extract the tortuosity of electrochemical 
devices. 

Recent modelling activities on SOFCs are still carried out on var- 
ious length scales, on the cell scale, a new design (double-sided 
cathodes) was modelled by Jiang et al . [104] . Kim and Lee [105] , 
Wang  et  al .  [106] ,  and  Zeng  et  al .  [107]  focused  on  the  thermal 
stresses  using  commercial  software.  Muramatsu  et  al .  [108]  de- 
veloped a simulation method to calculate non-stationary distribu- 
tions of the chemical potential of oxygen in a SOFC under opera- 
tion. Studies are also still performed on using new fuels for SOFCs 
such as ethanol [109] . On a system scale, research is carried out 
on a combined heat, hydrogen and power system [110] with vari- 
ous chillers [111] , on integrating SOFCs with various battery tech- 
nologies  [112]  on  SOFC  integration  in  unmanned  aerial  vehicles 
[113] and on SOFC-gas turbine systems [114] . 

2 O/CO 

2  electrolysis  and  H 

With regard to SOECs, models ranging from 1-D to 3-D have 
been  developed.  In  addition,  models  focusing  on  H 
2 O  electroly- 
2  co-electrolysis  are  also  to  be 
sis,  CO 
found.  Ni  et  al .  [ 115 , 116 ]  developed  a  1-D,  steady-state  model 
of  a  reversible  SOC  with  an  oxygen  ion-conducting  electrolyte 
and  proton-conducting  electrolyte.  It  was  found  that,  in  terms 
of electro-chemical performance, the cathode-supported conﬁgura- 
tion is the optimal design for SOCs in both SOFC and SOEC modes. 
As mentioned previously, in an SOFC the cathode is the air elec- 
trode, whereas in a SOEC it is the fuel electrode. Udagawa et al. 
developed a 1-D model of an SOEC stack comprised of cathode- 
supported solid oxide cells operating in steady state [117] and dy- 
namic conditions [118] . The 1-D models are useful for predicting 
the electrochemical behaviours of button cells, but for practical op- 
eration, composition and temperature variations along and across 
the gas channels are 2-D or 3-D models required. A series of 2-D 
thermo-electrochemical models were developed by Ni et al. , con- 
sidering the ﬂuid dynamics, heat transfer, chemical reactions and 
electrochemical reactions in SOECs used for H 
2 O electrolysis [119] , 
CO 
2 co-electrolysis [121] . 3-D SOEC 
models were developed by Hawkes et al. [122] . Choi et al. [123] , 
meanwhile, adapted an existing 3-D SOFC model [124] to obtain 
results for an SOEC.

2 O/CO 

In  terms  of  SOEC  reviews,  Ni  et  al.  [125]  published  a  review 
on high temperature SOECs, including both materials development 
and modelling effort s. In 2012, Laguna-Bercero published a review 
of the recent advances in high temperature SOECs [11] . The present 
review is focused more on the linkages between experiment and 
modelling, as well as the detailed origin of the modelling equations 
by phenomena and the various approaches used for both fuel cells 
and electrolysers alike. 

Even  if  there  are  large  numbers  of  scientiﬁc  papers  concern- 
ing  the  modelling  of  fuel  cells,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  electroly- 
sers, only a limited number of them directly tackle the problem 
of obtaining the physical parameters and coeﬃcients by concomi- 
tant experimental results rather than from the literature or by hy- 
pothesis. A methodology for bridging experimental and modelling 

13 

ﬁelds has been given by Leonide et al ., where EIS and equivalent 
circuit modelling (ECM) are used to deconvolute the electrochem- 
ical processes at  the  anode and  cathode  [126] and subsequently 
to parameterise an incremental cell model [35] , which has been 
applied in gas channel and repeat unit models [127] . Gong et al. 
[128]  used  an  adaptive  differential  evolution  algorithm  to  iden- 
tify  the  parameters  of  a  simple  1-D  SOFC  model,  while  Tade  et 
al . [129] proposed a technique for estimating the electrode charge 
transfer coeﬃcients from polarisation curves. With regard to the 
characteristics of composite electrodes, Reiss et al. [130] , Ni et al. 
[131] and Bertei et al. [132] proposed innovative methodologies to 
analyse the microstructural properties of the electrodes and apply 
them  to  continuum  models  in  order  to  understand  variations  in 
the cell performance. 

1.4. Model dimensionality and scale 

Modelling work represents numerous levels of simpliﬁcations, 
with the aim of striking a balance between available computational 
power  and  the  details  of  the  phenomena to  be  investigated.  Al- 
though available computational power has increased dramatically, 
there is still a need to strike a balance; the microstructural details 
of a cell might be important in certain macroscopic studies, while 
such details might be less important in the understanding of the 
response of an entire stack. In terms of dimensionality and scale, 
some comments will now be made that are relevant for the dis- 
cussions throughout the whole article. 

The book by Kulikovsky [133] contains analytical solutions to 
non-dimensional equations for a variety of fuel cell types. These 
solutions may be used for model veriﬁcation and to ‘get a feel’ for 
the problem, but it is doubtful that they could be used to design 
a  real  SOC  geometry.  For  that,  more  detailed  3-D  models,  often 
based  on  the  ﬁnite  volume  method  (FVM)  or  FEM,  are  typically 
employed. As early as 2002 and before, private sector SOC man- 
ufacturers were modifying commercial CFD codes to perform de- 
tailed 3-D calculations on single cells and stacks of up to 50 cells 
with  computational  meshes  of  10 6 ,  in  parallel  (up  to  40  cores), 
for design purposes [15] . However, only recently the idea of us- 
ing  cell-scale  codes  to  perform  calculations  on  stacks  has  come 
within the realm of possibility. For stacks, volume-averaging tech- 
niques are employed, together with some of the closures described 
below, to reduce the required memory and run time; see section 
2.11. The focus in this review is primarily on cell-scale models and 
their characterisation and validation. Continuum models of trans- 
port phenomena and electrochemistry in SOCs can range from sim- 
ple to complex in terms of detail, and from microns to meters, in 
scale.  Simple  0-D  and  1-D  models  are  useful  as  sub-scale  mod- 
els in larger system-level codes, and as education tools. As com- 
puter speed and memory size improve, the granularity and ﬁdelity 
of numerical modelling are proportionally increasing. Fig. 8 illus- 
trates the various processes to be considered in the construction 
of a mathematical model of an SOC, in particular the interaction 
between  transport  phenomena;  ﬂuid  ﬂow,  heat  and  mass  trans- 
fer, electric and chemical-kinetic phenomena. At each scale, it is 
usually necessary to prescribe closure terms and effective material 
properties that are often themselves obtained from detailed sub- 
scale  models,  empirical  correlations  or  analytical/semi-analytical 
methods.  Beale  et  al.  [134]  distinguish  between  ‘presumed  ﬂow 
models’, where only species continuity and energy are solved, and 
‘detailed numerical models’, where momentum conservation and 
detailed transport equations are employed with ﬁne meshes. The 
model of Achenbach [74] fell into the former category: Perfect mix- 
ing of the gases was assumed, so there were no cross-wise concen- 
tration gradients. 

Many early SOC models contained little or no electro-kinetics at 
all: At elevated temperatures, it was considered that the reaction

rates were suﬃciently fast that kinetic (activation) losses could be 
lumped-in  with  the  ohmic  losses  as  an  ‘area  speciﬁc  resistance’ 
(ASR), for which there is a semi-theoretical basis at low current 
densities (see section 2.5.1). This approach yielded reasonable re- 
sults in comparison with experiments that display approximately 
linear polarisation curves. The paradox with the ASR approach is 
that without a reaction there would, of course, be no current, how- 
ever  the  approach  is  valid  provided  the  reaction  rate  is  linearly 
proportional to the voltage reduction. Many authors treat the elec- 
trodes as being inﬁnitely thin, although there is evidence that the 
ﬁnite thickness of the electrodes affects the kinetics. Simpler mod- 
els treat the current density in the electrodes and the electrolyte of 
planar SOCs as being ‘locally 1-D’. Under these circumstances, it is 
not necessary to solve for the electronic and ionic potential ﬁelds, 
section 2.4, but rather by combining Ohm’s law with Kirchhoff’s 
second  law  for  the  circuit,  referred  hereinafter  as  the  Kirchhoff- 
Ohm equation, which relates the cell voltage, V , to the current den- 
sity, i (cid:3) (cid:3) :

Eq.  (6)  states  that  the  cell  voltage,  V ,  is  the  ideal  or  Nernst 
potential,  E ,  minus  losses,  namely  overpotentials  η = ηact ,a  and 
η = ηact ,f , which are air electrode and fuel (feedstock) electrode ac- 
tivation overpotentials, discussed in section 2.9.1, while R is resis- 
tance and is to be considered a function of temperature R = R ( T ) 
(see section 2.9.3). The issues of how to measure the values of R, 
E , etc. are further discussed below, in section 3. The reader will 
note  that  while  V  is  a  single  value,  the  terms  on  the  right-side 
of Eq. (6) are a function of its position in the cell plane (a 2-D 
model)  and  computational  volumes  (3-D)  are  only  used  for  the 
ﬂow and heat distribution, not for the electro-chemical reactions. If 
the ASR approach is adopted, R is an effective value, including ac- 
tivation losses, contact resistance(s), etc. implicitly, and under the 
circumstances ηact, a = η
act, f = 0. Otherwise, R is purely ohmic resis- 
tance and ηact, a  (cid:6) = 0,  η
act, f  (cid:6) = 0. Many authors refer to an ohmic 
ohm = i (cid:3) (cid:3) R  (section  2.9.3).  Eq.  (6)  is  to  be  consid- 
overpotential,  η
ered a basic equation that may be expressed in numerous differ- 
ent  forms.  Additional  electrode  overpotentials  may  be  expressed 
explicitly, e.g., due to mass transfer (section 2.9.2) and electric re- 
sistance. Although in electrochemistry it is customary to refer to all 
electric potential losses as overpotentials, as is shown in Fig. 4 (a); 
in modern 3-D computational models, mass transfer and electric 
resistance terms do not need to treated as such and may, for exam- 
ple, be obtained from the solution of partial differential equations. 
Conversely, for both single electrodes and electrode pairs, activa- 
tion losses are usually expressed as local overpotentials. 

The alternative to Eq. (6) is to solve for one or both of the elec- 
tronic  and  ionic  electric  ﬁeld  potentials  as  state-variables  in  the 
volumetric domains of the electrodes, electrolyte and interconnec- 
tors  (section  2.4).  These  will  be  referred  to  as  single-  and  two- 
potential models. The electric ﬁeld potentials drive the ﬂux of e −
electrons through the load. A two-potential model accounts for the 
fact that fuel/oxidant gases are being consumed/produced by the 
electrochemical reactions in the through-thickness direction of the 
electrodes. The two potentials will co-exist together with the pore 
gas, within the electrodes, for a continuum scale model. As the re- 
actions occur through the electrodes and with varying gas com- 
position, the activation overpotential varies. These local quantities 
may also be needed to pinpoint incipient degradation phenomena 
[ 135 , 136 ]. However, this substantially increases the complexity. 

Having  decided  on  the  model  dimensionality  (and  different 
model  components  may  be  of  different  dimensionalities),  at  the 
heart of the issue is thermodynamics; a proper understanding of 
which is prerequisite. The level of model parameterisation, which 
equations are to be solved, how the system of equations is closed 
and  what  parameters  must  be  measured  in  order  to  ensure  the 

number  of  independent  variables  equals  the  number  of  model 
equations,  must  be  taken  into  consideration.  The  end  user  faces 
a bewildering set of choices. Chemical and electrochemical kinet- 
ics (electrodics) must be taken into consideration, as SOCs oper- 
ate at ﬁnite rates under non-equilibrium conditions. As a result, 
sources and sinks of electrical charge, chemical compounds, and 
heat  arise;  Faraday’s  second  law  of  electrolysis,  Eq.  (2) ,  converts 
charge production into mass sources/sinks, and heat sources/sinks 
are obtained from thermodynamic laws. These are required in the 
balance of mass, momentum and energy, whereas the arising val- 
ues of temperatures, pressures and concentrations are required for 
the  prediction  of  the  thermodynamic,  kinetic  and  electric  quan- 
tities.  SOC  components  contain  a  number  of  composite  materi- 
als and porous layers. Effective property values must therefore be 
computed based on the best information at hand. All mathemat- 
ical models should be thoroughly validated/veriﬁed using theory, 
other  numerical  methods,  and  physical experiments.  These  must 
be devised in such a manner as to be independent from the pa- 
rameterisation of the model. When this cycle of interacting ﬁelds 
of science and engineering is complete, the fuel cell scientist has at 
his/her hands a tool capable of predicting the performance of SOCs. 
There is no ‘one-way’ but rather a myriad of possibilities that are 
improving over time. 

2. Current continuum scale cell models 

This section contains an overview of SOC models. The material 
is broken down according to subject matter in the sub-sections be- 
low; thermodynamics, transport, charge transfer, electrochemistry, 
chemistry and so forth. In each section the present state-of-the-art 
is presented together with discussions/recommendations as to best 
practices on a case-by-case basis. 

2.1. Basic thermodynamics 

Many of the items presented brieﬂy in this section will be fur- 
ther expanded in detail later in the paper. In an SOFC, the oxygen 
reduction reaction (ORR) takes place at the oxygen electrode, while 
in an SOEC oxygen evolution takes place at the oxygen electrode, 
and the ORR takes place at the fuel electrode.

Whereas hydrogen is a common SOFC fuel in the laboratory, al- 
most all SOFC systems are nowadays operated with hydrocarbon- 
based fuels. The stack is commonly fed with preconditioned fuels, 
for instance partially reformed natural gas or reformates of higher 
hydrocarbons. Fuels such as syngas or even ammonia are possible 
as well. Carbon-based fuel components, such as carbon monoxide 
or methane, may react electrochemically at the fuel electrode, see 
Eq. (10) . However, operation with such fuels may entail carbon de- 
position, leading to deactivation of the fuel electrode.

steam  reforming,  water-CO  shift  reaction,  and  so  on;  these  are 
further  discussed  below,  in  sections  2.6.1  and  2.6.2.  In  terms  of 
thermodynamics, the cell potential is related to the electrochem- 
ical  potential  difference  of  the  electrons  in  the  two  electrodes: 
E 0 = ( ¯μ

The species speciﬁc heat, c p , are given as polynomials in T for 
SOC  gases  in  Todd  and  Young  [137] ,  see  also  Hernando-Pacheco 
and Mann [138] The enthalpy of formation of the chemical reac- 
tion deﬁned by Eq. (14) is (cid:20)H = -247.3 kJ/mol at 10 0 0 °C, whereas 
the Gibbs energy of the formation is (cid:20)G = -177.4 kJ/mol, the neg- 
ative sign indicating that heat will be released at a rate of 69.9 
kJ/mol. Thus, the potential goes from 1.229 V at 25 °C to 0.94 V 
at 10 0 0 °C. The former value is for liquid water, while the value at 
10 0 0 °C is for gaseous water. This means that there is less electro- 
chemical energy as the temperature increases (or less additional 
potential is required for electrolyser mode). However, this decrease 
in potential is offset by the increase in the enthalpy of the gases. 
The entropic part is often referred to as reversible energy and rep- 
resents the heat necessary for the reaction to proceed and can be 
calculated as the difference between the cell potential and ther- 
moneutral potential, E H = (cid:20)H / 2F , i.e., using Eq. (13) with the en- 
thalpy not Gibbs free energy. 

The  cell  potential  is  also  impacted  by  concentration  changes. 
The reversible (or Nernst) cell potential E may be written for an 
arbitrary electrochemical reaction as:

dimensional expression, regardless of rearranging quotients as dif- 
ferences, the result will be always be the same, i.e., independent of 
the choice of units of p . The same logic may be applied to Eqs. (17) ,

In Eq. (21) , a single ideal or Nernst potential is formulated for 
the anode-cathode assembly. The Nernst potential can be consid- 
ered  the  sum  of  two  half-potentials  at  the  anode  and  cathode, 
E = E a - E 
f . However, the individual potentials cannot be measured

independently [139] and so the above potential is deﬁned with re- 
spect to an arbitrary reference electrode. For two-potential mod- 
els (see section 2.4), the Nernst potential for each of the electrode 
reactions are needed to determine the driving force at each elec- 
trode. These can be derived in a similar manner [135] :

Carbon monoxide can be oxidised in the electrochemical reac- 
tion and also react with water, i.e., the so-called water-gas shift 
reaction (WGSR). In SOFC modeling, it is assumed in many mod- 
els that that carbon monoxide is only reformed in the WGSR, i.e., 
one neglects the electrochemical reaction with carbon monoxide 
as reactant. Note that expressions for the Nernst potential for hy- 
drogen and for carbon monoxide are developed for simpliﬁed mix- 
tures with only one electrochemical reactant. Discussions on pos- 
sible approaches to deal with electrochemical reactions when both 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide is present are found in in Anders- 
son et al. [140] and Bao et al . [99] . 

Heat transfer is discussed in detail in section 2.7. For now, it 
is suﬃcient to note that heat is due to reversible and irreversible 
terms: 
˙ q =  ˙ q rev +  ˙ q irrev = i ( E H − E) + i (E − V ) 
where i is the cell current, V is the operating potential and E H = 
(cid:20)H(T ) / 2F is  the  thermo-neutral  potential,  Fig.  4 .  For  an  SOEC,  if 
the cell voltage is between the enthalpy and equilibrium poten- 
tials, the reaction is endothermic, and is exothermic otherwise. For 
most SOECs,  the reaction is endothermic at  low-to-medium cur- 
rent densities. SOFCs are exothermic over the entire range of their 
operation. 

(26) 

In addition to deﬁning the heat loss, one can also deﬁne a volt- 
age eﬃciency for an SOFC, ε = V/E , as the operating potential, V, is 
the Nernst potential E minus the losses (and the eﬃciency is thus 
less than 1). The reason is that E is proportional to the free energy 
(cid:20)G , and thus represents the energy input, whereas the operating 
potential V represents the (potential) work done by the cell (elec- 
trical power output). 

For an SOEC, the eﬃciency is deﬁned in terms of the energy 
output, i.e., chemical energy of the product, over energy input, i.e., 
electrical  power.  The  water  and  CO 
2  splitting  reactions  are  both 
endothermic and thus both require electricity, (cid:20)G , and heat, T (cid:20)S . 
The reaction heat can be supplied by the heat from the internal 
losses, or by preheating the gases. At the point where the inter- 
nal resistances exactly balance the reaction heat requirement, the 
cell is operating thermoneutrally. Below the thermoneutral poten- 
tial all the electrical power is converted to chemical energy, (cid:20)H , 
and the eﬃciency is thus 100 %, assuming that all heat to be sup- 
plied electrically. In most cases heat from down-stream processes 
(e.g.,  from  methanol  or  ammonia  synthesis)  is  available,  and  by 
supplying this heat to the SOEC in terms of water vapour, the ef- 
ﬁciency can go beyond 100 % (as the deﬁnition only accounts for 
the electrical energy input). If the potential is increased beyond the 
thermoneutral potential, E H , then the cell is operating exothermally 
overall (adding the two heat contributions), and the eﬃciency is 
thus ε= E H /V . The chemical energy of the product (e.g., hydrogen) 
is classically deﬁned in terms of either the lower heating value or 
the higher heating value, where the latter also includes the heat of 
evaporation, although both deﬁned at 25 °C higher heating value is 

16 

thus also rather close to the enthalpy (cid:20)H only with the difference 
that (cid:20)H is deﬁned at the reaction temperature. 

Eqs. (6) and (17) do not yet constitute a closed system of equa- 
tions, as there are four unknown scalar ﬁelds, E, i (cid:3)(cid:3) , ηact, a , ηact. f , 
it being assumed that the cell voltage, V , or equivalently the to- 
tal current, are prescribed. Therefore, additional equations are re- 
quired for the activation overpotentials. These are described in sec- 
tion  2.5.1.  In  addition,  the  equations  for  mass  transport  (section 
2.3), energy (section 2.7), momentum (section 2.2) and additional 
chemical reactions (section 2.6) must be solved. 

2.2. Continuity and momentum 

The overall continuity equation may be written equivalently in 

either mass or molar units [141] , as: 
∂ρ

∂t 
D t 

+ div ( ρu ) = ˙ r 

+ ρdiv u =

∂c 
∂t 
where D denotes the so-called ‘total’ derivative, u and u ∗ are the 
mass-averaged and molar-averaged velocity and  ˙ r (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) is a volumet- 
ric mass source, for example due to chemical/electrochemical re- 
actions in a porous media (but typically zero in the gas channels, 
where mass is conserved). For a mixture of components ρ = (cid:22)ρ
i 
is mixture density, deﬁned in Eq. (32) . In Eq. (28) , c = (cid:22)c 
i is total 
concentration and  ˙ R (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) = M ˙ r (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) is a molar source, typically non-zero, 
as moles are not conserved and M is a mixture molar mass. Gener- 
ally speaking, the mass-form is preferred when detailed 3-D com- 
putational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) calculations are performed, as the 
velocity then corresponds to that in the Navier-Stokes and energy 
equations.  However,  both  forms  proliferate  in  the  SOC  commu- 
nity . Therefore, interconversion is frequently required. When elec- 
trodes are treated as being of ﬁnite thickness, the mass source/sink 
terms in Eq. (27) are obtained by summing the individual species 
source/sink terms, as outlined in section 2.3. 

The mass balance, Eq. (27) , and momentum transport equations 
are needed to close the system of equations to be solved. Although 
it is possible that the ﬂow may be turbulent, for example in the 
manifolds of an SOC stack, generally speaking in the gas channels, 
the laminar Navier-Stokes equations are considered to apply: 

∂ 
∂t 

( ρu ) + div ( ρuu ) = −grad p + div μdef u − 2 

3 ( grad μdiv u ) + ρb 
(29) 

i, j ˆ e 

where def u = u 
j . If the ﬂow (as opposed to the gas mixture) 
is treated as incompressible, then def u is replaced by grad u and 
div u = 0 in Eq. (29) : Not only are the Mach numbers trivially small, 
but also the rate of change of chemical species (mixture density, ρ) 
are also small. Body forces, b , can also be neglected. 

In the porous layers, either the superﬁcial (ﬁlter) velocity, U , or 
the interstitial (pore) velocity, u , may be selected as a dependent 
variable. A momentum balance, for local void fraction, ε, would be

In some cases the laminar ﬂow in the ﬂow channels can be de- 
scribed by Darcy’s law through a volume averaged analogy. This 
is highly recommendable, as it signiﬁcantly reduces the need for 
computational resources, allowing for swifter generation of results.

When electrodes of ﬁnite thickness are employed in a model, 
the  mass  sources/sinks  are  obtained  from  the  exchange  current 
density according to Faraday’s second law of electrolysis, Eq. (2) , 
expressed per unit volume  ˙ r (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 
j F , and sgn ( j ) is + 1 
for  products  and  -1  for  reactants.  If  the  electrodes  are  treated 
as  inﬁnitely  thin  surfaces,  the  mass  sources/sinks  are  generally 
treated as boundary conditions, with,  ˙ m (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i F . The to- 
tal  mass  ﬂux  is  obtained  by  summing  the  terms  for  the  active 
species. The total ﬂux, N 
i , and a 
i , is composed of a diffusive term, J 
i u ∗. Eqs. (35) - (36) represent alternative forms for 
convective term, c 
a system of unclosed equations. It is necessary to make a consti- 
tutive assumption. Both Fick’s law and Maxwell-Stefan have been 
employed in the gas channels. The former is used in binary sys- 
tems, while the latter is more suitable for multicomponent systems 
with signiﬁcant differences in the molar masses of the species [95] . 
Fick’s law can be written as: 
j i = −ρD grad y i 

i  = sgn ( j) i (cid:3)(cid:3) M

J i = −cD grad x i 

(39)

The  system  of  equations in  Eqs.  (38) and  (39) are solved  to- 
gether  with  Eqs.  (35)  or  (36),  the  Darcy-modiﬁed  Navier-Stokes 
equations, Eq. (30) , the energy equation (section 2.7), as well as 
additional equations describing chemical (section 2.6) and electro- 
chemical (section 2.5) processes. 

The simplest mass transfer analysis is to presume that at any 

boundary, a rate equation applies:

where g is a mass transfer coeﬃcient and x

bulk and wall values (for readability, the subscript ‘ i ’ has been ex- 
cluded. Imperfect mixing can then be accounted-for in even the 
simplest SOC models [144] . Both Eqs. (40) and (41) are valid for bi- 
nary and dilute mixtures, as well as for concentrated multi-species 
mixtures where the binary diffusivities are similar in magnitude. 
For  any  given  geometry,  such  as  a  channel  or  porous  geometry, 
the  mass  transfer  coeﬃcient  may  be  obtained  from  the  correla- 
tions for the Sherwood number, Sh, or Stanton number, St, based 
on an analytical solution, numerical integration scheme [145] , or 
as the result of a physical experiment. The Stanton number is typ- 
ically correlated as a function of the Schmidt number, Sc = μ/ ρD 
and Reynolds number, Re = uL /ν, where u is velocity and L is a 
length-scale. For example, 

St =

ρU

Re n 

(42) 

The value of the exponent, m , determines how much the diffu- 
sivity, D , affects the rate of mass transfer. To illustrate: with m = - 
2/3, if D were increased 10-fold, this would result in g only increas- 
ing to 4.6 times the initial value. Thus, although the magnitude of 
the diffusivity, D , is important, the overall impact on mass transfer 
should not be overstated. While concentration gradients exist at all 
current densities, mass transport issues are most important at high 
mass ﬂuxes/current densities; generally SOCs are seldom operated 
there, due to degradation issues. Fig. 4 b shows the voltage reduc- 
tion associated with concentration gradients, for a small 1cm 2 cell. 
For ternary, quaternary and higher order mixtures of species, 
the  binary  species  diffusion  coeﬃcients,  D 
ij ,  cannot  generally  be 
employed [146] . A number of methods for computing the diffusiv- 
ity of a given species in a mixture, D 
i , from the binary diffusivities, 
D 

ij , e.g., Wilke [147] :

j(cid:6) = i 

(43) 

which is, in principle, restricted to a situation in which a single 
species i diffuses in a stagnant multi-component. The binary diffu- 
sivities, Ðij = Ðij ( T, p ), may be computed from mathematical corre- 
lations, for example Fuller et al. [148] and Poling et al. [149] . Only 
n -1  terms  are  required  in  Eq.  (43) ,  the  n th  term  being  obtained 
from overall continuity, Eq. (27) . A more detailed constitutive rela- 
tionship is the so-called generalised Fick’s law:

Unlike  the  binary  diffusion  coeﬃcients,  D

mass/mole fractions. These may be obtained from the mathemat- 
ical inversion of the Maxwell-Stefan equations, Taylor and Krishna

[146] ,  whereby  the  gradients  are  expressed  as  a  function  of  the 
ﬂuxes. 

In  addition  to  gas  channels,  SOCs  contain  porous  elec- 
trodes/transport layers, details of which are not typically resolved 
in  cell-level  models,  which  necessitate  the  computation  of  ‘ef- 
fective’ diffusivities and other properties, as described in section 
2.8, below. Traditionally, concepts such as ‘tortuosity’ and ‘tortu- 
osity factor’ [ 150 , 151 ] were employed to derive simplistic expres- 
sions for effective properties. A more recent approach is to inde- 
pendently  perform  detailed  micro-scale  simulations  and  employ 
volume-averaging on porous ensembles to generate property val- 
ues [152] . This relies on advanced imaging methods being available 
to digitise typical geometries (see section 2.8). 

The following equation describes the Maxwell-Stefan equations 

[ 153 , 154 ]:

(46) 

i  is the partial pressure of species i, p the total pressure 
where p 
ij the binary diffusion coeﬃcient be- 
in the control volume and D 
tween species i and j. To ensure ﬂux consistency, Eq. (37) must be 
satisﬁed [ 155 , 156 ]. Eq. (46) may be conveniently written in terms 
of mole fractions: 

grad p i

(cid:4)

(47) 

In the event that grad p is small (if it is not, this is added as an 
additional pressure-diffusion term), this may be conveniently re- 
written in terms of the mole fractions as: 
(cid:4)
x i x j 
D i j

Following Taylor and Krishna [146] , this may be considered a 
matrix equation, noting that only n -1 terms are independent owing 
to ﬂux conservation, Eq. (37) . Discarding the redundant n th equa- 
tion for the chosen ‘carrier’ species,

Maxwell and Stefan were mass-based.

which can be inverted to obtain the generalised Fick’s law in mass

evaluation of the n- 1 binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coeﬃcients 
and mathematically invert the n -1 equations to obtain the gener- 
alised Fick’s law, Eq. (44) : 
(cid:16)−1 
i = −ρ

which is employed in popular CFD codes in use today. However, 
the matrix inversion is computationally expensive and numerical 
instabilities have been reported when numerous species are con- 
sidered. Another approach, due to Kleijn et al. [157] , involves im- 
plicitly inverting the diagonal ﬂux terms to obtain a gradient, but 
explicitly leaving the off-diagonal terms as ﬂuxes, n rather than n -1 
equations are solved. Regardless of the methodology followed, sub- 
stantial additional computational effort is added, as compared to a 
simple formulation of Fick’s law. 

(54) 

An order of magnitude analysis is suitable to ascertain whether 
the Wilke form of Fick’s law approximates the Maxwell-Stefan for- 
mulation  in  SOCs.  Following  the  approach  of  Krishna  and  Stan- 
dart [158] , it is possible to ‘force’ the Maxwell-Stefan formulation, 
i = −c D 
Eq. (48) , into a ﬂux-gradient form, with J

The stoichiometric coeﬃcients in Eq. (55) may be substituted 
for the molar ﬂuxes at the electrodes,  ˙ N (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i , where it is under- 
stood that the coeﬃcients on the left-side of Eq. (11) are negative 
and those on the right-side are positive. This approach differs from 
the later approach of Krishna [ 159 , 160 ], where it is assumed that 
˙ N (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i  = −c D 
i , which is only appropriate for no net molar ﬂux. 
Table  1  shows  a  comparison  of  the  diffusivities  of  the  trans- 
ferred  substances  based  on  the  approaches  of  Wilke  [147] , 
Eq.  (43)  and  Krishna  and  Standart  [158] ,  Eq.  (55)  for:  (a)  SOFC 
2 O; (b) SOFC 
air composed of a ternary mixture of N

fuel composed of a ternary mixture of N

SOFC  fuel  composed  of  a  quinary  mixture  of  H 
and CO

ployed  for  benchmark  test  2  in  the  International  Energy  Agency 
task on the Modelling and Evaluation of Advanced Solid Oxide Fuel 
Cells, Achenbach [23] . It is assumed that H 
2 and CO are consumed 
equally. Binary coeﬃcients were evaluated using [ 148 , 149 ] at 1173 
K and 1.01325 bar.

It can be seen that for (a), the ternary air mixture with a sin- 
gle transferred substance, oxygen, Eq. (55) identically reduces to 
Wilke’s equation, Eq. (43) , for the transferred substance diffusiv- 
ity, D O 
2 , lending conﬁdence to using this calculation procedure at 
the air electrode. For the considered (non-transferred) phases, the 
mixture diffusivities computed by Eq. (43) are only the binary dif- 
= 0 , 
fusivities. (b) For the ternary fuel mixture, Eq. (55) returns D N 
2 
which is clearly incorrect and due to the shortcomings of ‘forcing’ 
the formulation when there is zero ﬂux and zero gradient. Atten- 
tion  is  therefore  restricted  to  transferred  substances.  The  errors 
in  the  transferred  substance  diffusivities  when  comparing  Wilke 
and Krishna and Standart are -9% and -6%, respectively. (c) For the 
2 O, there is a substantial under 
quinternary mixture, however, for H 
prediction of -37% for the mixture diffusivity, by the Wilke method. 
At elevated temperatures, the ratio of the mean free path of the 
pore gas and the size of the pores is often such that Knudsen diffu- 
sion may be signiﬁcant, and the molecules collide more frequently 
with the pore walls than with other molecules [77] .

M < 1, and D 
Kn > 0. Eq. (56) states that (i) the Knudsen and binary 
i , 
diffusion coeﬃcients may simply be added harmonically, generally 
referred to as Bosanquet’s relation [161-163] and (ii) that effective 
values of both Knudsen and binary diffusion scale by the same fac- 
tor, M. The equation for the Knudsen diffusion coeﬃcient takes the 
following form: 

(cid:17) 

D i, Kn =

¯r p

π M i 

(57) 

where ¯r p is the average pore radius in the porous matrix, the value 
of which is extremely important. 

The  dusty  gas  model,  proposed  by  Mason  and  Malinauskas 
[163] , explicitly takes into consideration the three different types 
of mass transfer mechanisms in a porous matrix: multicomponent 
bulk diffusion, Knudsen diffusion, and Darcy’s law, and has been 
praised [164-165] as a mechanistic approach to model gas trans- 
port through porous media [166] . The general form, neglecting the 
effects of thermal diffusion, is expressed by means of the following 
equation:

Attending to the relatively small volume of state-of-the-art SOC 
electrodes and to the complexity of the dusty gas model, most au- 
thors assume the viscous ﬂux to be negligible, grad p ≈ 0 . Then, a 
so-called modiﬁed Maxwell-Stefan model is obtained. The premise 
of grad( p ) = 0 is inconsistent with the DGM as this model inher- 
ently includes a variation of pressure throughout the porous elec- 
trode in its formulation, as shown by Bertei et al . [167] . Model val- 
idation for this was completed by Webb et al . [165] for binary mix- 
tures with experimental data gathered by Evans et al. [168] . 

More recently, an approximation of the dusty gas model was 
derived by Kong et al. [169] in the form of a modiﬁed Fick’s law. 
Several  researchers  have  reviewed  the  use  of  simpler  models  to 
investigate their range applicability and validity. Fick’s law based 
on Wilke’s approximation can be extended to account for Knudsen 
diffusion. It has a tendency to overestimate the resistance for the 
mass transfer compared to the dusty gas model [170] . 

Research into a modiﬁed Fick’s model (including the geomet- 
ric  M- factor,  and  Knudsen-modiﬁed  binary  diffusion  coeﬃcients 
[171] found no noteworthy difference from the dusty gas model for 
a wide range of the investigated geometries and operating param- 
eters. Without Knudsen diffusion, the Maxwell-Stefan formulation 
is insensitive to the pore diameter and tends to underestimate the 
mass transfer resistance [170] . 

19 

In the work by Bao et al. [172] , the extended Maxwell-Stefan 
approach was found to overestimate the mass transfer resistance 
compared  to  the  dusty  gas  model.  Recommendations  on  when 
to apply different models were also provided by Suwanwarangkul 
et al. [170] Mention is to be made of the notable papers on the 
binary friction model [173] and the cylindrical pore interpolation 
model [174] . 

The newcomer to the ﬁeld faces a disturbing array of choices 
from simple to complex, as described above. The choice will de- 
pend  on  the  composition  of  the  reactants/products  and  current 
density,  Mass  transfer  is  the  rate-limiting  factor  at  high  current 
densities. At low to intermediate values, its importance is dimin- 
ished. A Fick’s law approach would appear suﬃcient at the oxygen 
electrode, whilst at the fuel electrode, depending on the compo- 
nents, an order of magnitude analysis can determine the appropri- 
ate method. Fortunately, modern general-purpose CFD codes (both 
commercial and open-source) typically allow for a choice of diffu- 
sion models to be implemented at run-time. The simpler models 
can then be benchmarked against the more detailed closures, eas- 
ing the choice of diffusion model in each component of the elec- 
trochemical cell. 

2.4. Charge transport 

While one can assume that the cell potential can be equated 
with the Nernst potential less losses, as in the Kirchhoff-Ohm rela- 
tionship, Eq. (6) , this does not consider changes within actual elec- 
trode structures. Thus, further details on the overpotential varia- 
tion  and  local  concentrations  through  the  electrodes  can  be  ob- 
tained  by  modelling  both  the  ionic  and  electronic  potentials  re- 
ferred to in this paper as two-potential models [ 135 , 136 ]. It is tac- 
itly assumed here that only O 2 − ions and not e − or H 
2  gas are 
transported across the electrolyte (no leakage), which is generally 
not a serious problem for solid oxide devices. Volume-averaging, 
i.e., a ‘homogenised’ description, is typically employed in the elec- 
trodes,  with  electronic  and  ionic  charges  coexisting  within  the 
same computational volume,  together  with  the  gas  species.  Cur- 
rent densities in the electrodes and electrolyte are proportional to 
the potential gradients:

and σ eff

trodes and interconnectors, and the electrodes and electrolyte. The 
starting point for the conservation equations is the Nernst-Planck 
relationship, where it is presumed that the ﬂux of charged parti- 
cles is due to species convection, diffusion, and charge migration. 
In SOCs, only the latter is considered signiﬁcant and the system

variation is found other than in the active parts of the cell. The 
slope through the electrolyte is due to the transport of ions. The 
variation in the electrodes is partly due to the transport of ions, 
but also to the gradual generation/depletion of ions moving away 
from the electrolyte. φ
el is deﬁned in the electrodes and intercon- 
nectors, and is discontinous, as it is not deﬁned in the electrically- 
insulating electrolyte. Furthermore, due to the good electronic con- 
ductivity of the electrodes, the slope is very ﬂat (little resistance 
entails a good distribution of the electric potential). The direction 
of the slope is the same as that of the ionic species (both species 
are negatively charged, and so travel in the same direction). 

el = 0 and φ

Generally-speaking, the boundary conditions for φ

el for at least 
two or more points in the interconnects may be either potentio- 
static (Dirichlet), for example φ
el = V , or mixed poten- 
tiostatic/galvanostatic (Dirichlet/Von Neumann), for example φ
el = 
el / ∂n = 0 , whereas for the ionic potential the boundary 
0 and ∂ φ
conditions will be entirely Von Neumann, ∂ φ
io / ∂n = 0 . Although 
it is possible to code ‘jump’ or ‘slip’ boundaries in Dirichlet form 
[175] , this is seldom done in electrochemical codes, a recent ex- 
ception being the work of Weber et al. [176] . 

io  is an algebraic function of φ
φ
el  and therefore, the problem 
is well-posed even without ﬁxing φ
io  at an interior point. How- 
ever,  initial  values  must  be  carefully  chosen  and  relaxation  em- 
ployed, or convergence may be elusive. Alternatively, it is possible 
to enumerate the total current at both the air and fuel electrodes 
and scale the source terms if anodic and cathodic currents are not 
equal (block adjustment). These issues can be obviated by employ- 
ing a coupled solution scheme for the two scalar variables. 

In many cases a two potential model may not be necessary, if 
the objective is to understand the overall behaviour of a cell or 
a stack. In this case single potential models are easier and faster 
to implement, see section 2.5. The detailed resolution of the over- 
potential variation does however provide the opportunity to un- 
derstand the reason for local degradation phenomena, which occur 
through the thickness of the electrode, see section 2.12.

The Kirchhoff-Ohm form for potential, Eq. (6) , can be easily de-

fer are simpliﬁed to occur in an inﬁnitely thin volume (a plane). 
Only one potential is needed, with the reactions at the electrode 
interfaces represented as potential jumps. Furthermore let σ be as- 
sumed to be constant.

anode,  electrolyte,  and  cathode),  eliminating  φ one  may  readily 
obtain  Eq.  (6) .  Thus,  the  assumption  that  the  ionic  charge  ﬂux 
is 1-D locally hinges on a number of premises and corresponds, 
rather loosely, with the ‘segmented cell’ employed in experimen- 
tal measurements of local current density (see Fig. 7 ). The poten- 
tial/voltage loss in the interconnector may similarly be written as 
η = Ri (cid:3) (cid:3) where R = L/ Sσ , L is interconnect thickness and S is a (con- 
duction)  shape  factor  obtained  by  solving  the  Laplacian  for  the 
detailed ribbed (or other) geometry. Clearly, for planar geometry, 
S = 1.

is given by a suitable electrochemical kinetic expression, such as 
the Butler-Volmer equation. This can be derived analytically for a

ysis (see Glasstone et al. [177] ), on the assumption that the prob-

vides a rationale to account for concentration changes in comput- 
ing η in 3-D SOCs, employing a Kirchhoff-Ohm methodology.

k  for  Eq.  (67) ,  as  obtained 
by Leonide et al. [ 35 , 178 ] for a Jülich Mark-F SOC, may be found 
in Table 2 . Note that the activation energy is a crucial parameter 
when describing the electrochemistry within a SOC, and a range 
of  values  between  100  and  190  kJ  mol −1  is  found  in  literature. 
The exchange current density is hard to differentiate and estimate, 
when two or more competing reactions occur at the same time. 
Notice that most published models in the continuum scale assume 
a single global charge transfer reaction; An alternative formulation 
is found in Zhu et al. [67] and Hecht et al. [181] who proposes a 
complex reaction order dependence of the exchange current den- 
sity  assuming  that  the  charge  transfer  mechanism  at  the  TPB  is 
the  rate-limiting  factor,  while  the  rest  of  the  reactions:  adsorp- 
tion/desorption of H 
2 on the nickel surface, adsorption/desorption 
of H 
2 O on the YSZ surface and oxygen ion transfer between the 
bulk  and  surface  of  the  YSZ  are  in  equilibrium.  Similarly  at  the 
negative fuel electrode, the authors assume that the formation of 
O 2 − ions and the subsequent incorporation into the electrolyte is 
the rate-limiting reaction in the positive (air) electrode. The elec- 
trochemical reactions are described by a ﬁve step elementary reac- 
tion mechanism by Lee et al . [182] , among others. 

Eqs.  (17) ,  (6)  and  (64)  represent  four  equations  in  four  un- 
knowns, Nernst potential, E , two activation overpotentials, ηa and 
η
f , and current density, i”. These are to be considered a function 
of temperature and pressure, species mass/mole fractions and lo- 
cation.  Thus,  the  system  is  fully  coupled.  Mass  source  and  sink 
terms in the species and continuity equations, Eqs. (35) and (27) , 
are  prescribed  from  the  local  current  density,  via  Faraday’s  sec- 
ond law of electrolysis, Eq. (2) , whereas temperature, pressure and 
mass fractions are obtained from the solutions of Eqs. (73) , (27) , 
(35) , and Eq. (30) . Alternatively, the system of Eqs. (61) - (62) may 
be solved in place of Eq. (6) , if more detail is required. 

In  this  section  the  global  reaction  mechanisms  that  describe 
electrochemical kinetics were introduced. These describe the kinet- 
ics for modelling in the continuum scale, at a reasonable accuracy. 
More detailed kinetics may be obtained by using multiple step re- 
action mechanisms. 

The reaction kinetics is mostly dominant at low current den- 
sities (activation), and for other type of electrochemical cells the 
non-linear form of the Butler-Volmer equation Eq. (64) can be used 
to capture the higher losses here. However, characterisation of an 
SOC for both electrolysis and fuel cell modes of operation shows 
that the i (cid:3)(cid:3) -V curves are basically straight at low currents, see for 
example, [ 183 , 184 ], indicating that no particular activation losses 
are present at low current density. Eq. (66) can often thus be ap- 
plied as a good approximation. Once again, the reader is faced with 
a dichotomy of opinions when trading off complexity and accuracy 
for the particular materials used in the SOC. 

2.5.2. Electrochemically-active surface area 

The oxidation of H 

2 and/or CO (SOFC) or the reduction of H 

2 O 
and/or  CO 
2  (SOEC)  occurs  at  the  TPB,  which  is  distributed  in  a 
thin volume, around 20-40 μm-thick. A larger TPB density results 
in additional reaction sites, or in other words, a smaller electrode 
activation  polarisation.  For  the  TPB  to  be  active,  all  three  elec- 
tronic,  ionic,  and  gas  phases  must  form  three  continuous  inter- 
connected regions. If any subregion of a phase is not connected, 
the TPB cannot be supplied and becomes inactive. In the case of 
electrolyte-supported cells, Ni/Ceria cermets are favoured [185] . In 
these electrodes, the ionic conducting YSZ is replaced by doped ce- 
ria,  a  mixed  ionic/electronic  conductor  in  the  fuel  electrode  en- 
vironment.  The  electrochemical  reaction  is  no  longer  limited  to 
the TPB, as the reaction can occur across the ceria surface with- 
out the presence of a continuous Ni-matrix. Furthermore, ceria of- 
fers advantages with respect to sulphur tolerance [186] and car- 
bon  deposition  [187] .  Previous-generation  air  electrodes  were  of 

S.B. Beale, M. Andersson, C. Boigues-Muñoz et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100902 

the  composite  type,  the  vast  majority  of  them  comprising  LSM- 
YSZ. Nowadays, better performing electrodes are made with mixed 
ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) such as L SCF and L SC. 

Two  distinct  approaches  regarding  the  numerical  designation 
of the TPB in composite electrodes can be found in the literature 
[188] . The ﬁrst, Costamagna et al. [189] , hypothesises that the ac- 
tive sites are proportional to the contact area of intersecting elec- 
tronic and ionic conducting particles and thus expressed as a sur- 
face area per unit volume (m 2 m −3 ). This approach is suitable if the 
electron-conducting  phase  exhibits  a  suﬃciently  high  ionic  con- 
ductivity to transport ions from the surface to the interface and the 
charge transfer process at this interface is rate limiting. The sec- 
ond approach suggests that the reactions take place on the space- 
curve formed by the intersection of the electronic and ionic parti- 
cles, hence being expressed as a length per unit volume (m (cid:2)m −3 ) 
[190] and thus is suitable for cermets exhibiting a purely electronic 
conducting (metallic) phase, such as nickel. 

Nowadays, microstructural properties expressed as volume frac- 
tions of different phases, particle size distributions, volume-speciﬁc 
surface  and  interface  areas,  and  TPB  lengths,  are  evaluated  by 
means of tomographic methods and suitable algorithms to extract 
the desired parameters from the 3-D voxel image, as well as by ar- 
tiﬁcially synthesising and analysing generated 3-D microstructures. 
For reasonable accuracy, the TPB region may be described as a sur- 
face area per unit volume, at the continuum scale. A more detailed 
approach may be of interest, at smaller length scales. 

2.6. Chemical reactions 

When a fuel mixture containing methane and carbon monoxide 
is supplied in SOFC mode, reforming reactions take place. Methane 
reacts with steam in the methane steam reforming reaction (MSR). 
Carbon monoxide reacts with water in the water gas shift reac- 
tion (WGSR), and can also be oxidised in the electrochemical reac- 
tion (see section 2.1). The WGSR takes place in the fuel electrode 
as  well  as  in  the  gas  channel  (e.g.,  in  the  bulk  ﬂow),  while  the 
catalytically-dependent MSR takes place in the electrode, only. 

The reforming chemistry can either be described with an ele- 
mentary heterogeneous approach (as in Zhu et al. [67] with a reac- 
tion mechanism with 42 reaction steps), see also Hecht et al. [181] , 
or according to a global kinetics approach (as in Andersson et al. 
[ 62 , 140 ]) with 2 reactions, i.e., the MSR and the WGSR). Since the 
focus of this paper is on the continuum scale, the reforming chem- 
istry in sections 2.6.1-2.6.2 are described according to a global ki- 
netics  approach.  Note  that,  the  MSR  reaction  at  SOFC  operating 
conditions is far from equilibrium, i.e., kinetically controlled, com- 
pared to the WGSR that is thermodynamically controlled. There are 
various methods that describe MSR reactions at a continuum scale, 
for example ﬁrst order kinetics, Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, as 
well as higher-order kinetics [191] . 

2.6.1. Methane steam reforming 

The steam reforming of methane, 

C H 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 

(68) 

is thermodynamically favoured by high temperatures (strongly en- 
dothermic reaction) and low pressures [192] , and may be written 
as an Arrhenius type equation,

(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) = k · p m

· p n 

(69) 

The reaction orders of methane and water, m and n in Eq. (69) , 
are  ﬁtted  to  experimental  data,  with  considerably  different  val- 
ues  possible  [93] ;  m  varies  between  0.85  and  1.4.  Both  positive 
and negative values exist for n, depending on the operating con- 
ditions.  The  large  discrepancies  between  the  MSR  reaction  rates 

22 

depend on the reaction being strongly dependent on the steam- 
to-carbon ratio, with various experiments having been carried out 
with signiﬁcantly different values [193] . Different values of m, n , 
were recorded by Nguyen et al. [194] . A small steam-to-carbon ra- 
tio provides a positive reaction order for water. A ratio of around 
2 yields reaction orders of water close to zero, while a high ra- 
tio provides negative values [195] . A comparison between differ- 
ent MSR reaction rates, implemented in the same model, can be 
found in Wang et al. [193] and Paradis et al. [ 193 , 196 ]. The var- 
ious  expressions  describing  the  reaction  originate  from  different 
sets of experimental measurements. An alternative to Eq. (69) is 
a Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression [197] . Haberman and Young’s 
model [198] is also frequently used, when modelling the MSR re- 
action rate. Another set of empirical equations used regularly was 
proposed  by  Lehnert  et  al.  [192] .  The  gas  composition  was  that 
from the 1996 IEA SOFC benchmark [23] , with methane as a fuel. 
Any correlation should agree with the data for the experimental 
conditions, mainly with respect to temperature and SC ratio. One 
of the advantages of the SOFC is the possibility to internally reform 
methane rich fuels, which also consumes some of the heat gener- 
ated by the electrochemical reactions. A global MSR reaction rate 
gives reasonable accuracy for continuum scale modelling. 

2.6.2. Water-gas-shift reaction 

Steam enhances the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon 

dioxide and hydrogen via the reaction: 

CO+ H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 

(70) 

The reaction rate proposed by Haberman and Young [198] for 
the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) at around 800 °C is given by:

with E act = 103191 J (cid:2)mol −1 and A = 0.0171 mol (cid:2)m −3 (cid:2)Pa −2 (cid:2)s −1 [198] . 
A modiﬁed approach is suggested in Lehnert et al. [192] . The WGSR 
is  faster  than  the  electrode  reaction  with  carbon  monoxide.  The 
reaction rate for the WGSR is also less critical than for MSR and 
can occur at relatively high operating temperatures, such as 750 to 
900 °C, and can be assumed to be in equilibrium [ 140 , 192 , 198 , 199 ]. 

2.7. Heat transfer 

Heat transfer and temperature distribution are among the most 
important concerns in SOC design due to the high operating tem- 
peratures. Should thermal gradients become excessive, mechanical 
failure will occur. Fig. 10 shows the different modes of heat trans- 
fer within the SOC. The heat equation in the gas channels involve 
convection  and  conduction  with  no  heat  generation  (neglecting 
pressure work, radiative ﬂux, species diffusion and viscous dissipa- 
tion). For the passive electrode layers, the heat equation primarily 
involves heat generation caused by ohmic heating and conjugate 
heat transfer by conduction and convection in solid and ﬂuid re- 
gions. The heat generation in the electrodes and electrolyte, and 
subsequent dissipation result in a temperature distribution within 
the cell that inﬂuences its performance. 

For a multi-species mixture, the principle of conservation of en- 

ergy may be written:

thickness.  The  overpotential  can  be  broken  into  a  number  of 
different  contributions,  which  all  contribute  to  the  evolution  of 
heat, see section 2.9. 

Also, the chemical (not electrochemical) reactions described in 
section 2.6 can generate or consume heat and can be written ac- 
cording to:

rxn = (cid:20)H ˙ r 
˙ q 
where  (cid:20)H  is  obtained  from  Eq.  (15)  for  all  reactants/products. 
For values of (cid:20)H 
0  between 600 K and 1200 K, the reaction heat 
(J/mol) for reversible WGSR and reversible MSR reaction can be ap- 
proximated as [ 200 , 201 ]: 
(cid:20)H = A + BT 

(77) 

(76) 

where A = -206205.5 J/mol, B = -19.517 J/(mol (cid:2)K) for MSR and A = - 
45063 J/mol, B = -10.28 J/(mol (cid:2)K) for WGSR. Heat generated is re- 
distributed  through  the  electrodes,  electrolyte,  and  interconnects 
by conduction,  and carried away by gas and coolant streams by 
convection, and radiation. 

2.7.2. Porous media and stacks 

Considering Eq. (73) , either by neglecting pressure work, radia- 
tive ﬂux, species diffusion, volumetric sources of heat and viscous 
dissipation, or (better) by including them as source terms,  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) , we 
obtain the equation:

(78) 

The  ﬁrst  four  terms  in  Eq.  (80)  are  referred  to  as  (i)  tran- 
sient, (ii) convection, (iii) conduction, and (iv) source (sink) terms. 
Term (v) is absent in porous regions; it is employed in some stack 
models to account for ‘interphase heat transfer’ e.g., between, say, 
the gas channel and the electrolyte and interconnect regions. The 
quantity U v  is a ‘volumetric heat transfer coeﬃcient’. For conve- 
nience, only one source term,  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) , is shown, although there will be 
i , in 
more, as discussed above. The species diffusion terms, div

Eq. (73) are only negligible in the event of the Lewis number being 
unity, Le = Pr/Sc = 1. Todd and Young [137] indicate that at 10 0 0 K, 
2 O are approximately 0.73 and 0.86, respectively, 
Pr for H 
2  and H 
2 , Sc = 0.36, so that, depending on con- 
whereas for 50% mol H 
centration, 0.4 ≤ Le ≤ 0.5. Under the circumstances, the species 
diffusion terms should therefore be included as source terms. 

2 O/H 

The  velocity  components  are  derived  from  the  momentum 
equations, Eq. (29) or Eq. (30) . Joule heating is due to the resis- 
tance to electron ﬂow, Eq. (29) or (30). For the chemically-active 
electrodes, reversible heat sources, Eq. (74) , are additionally pre- 
scribed on a volumetric or per unit area basis. For the solid elec- 
trolyte, the main terms in Eq. (80) are due to Joule heating and 
heat conduction.  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)  is generated by Joule heating caused by the 
migration  of  charged  ions,  and  by  the  electrochemical  reactions. 
Both  metallic  and  ceramic  interconnectors  are  employed  in  pla- 
nar solid oxide cells. The electrical resistance of the former, while 
small, should still be accounted for as a heating source. Indeed, a 
high thermal conductivity is beneﬁcial and ensures that the inter- 
connector redistributes heat and thereby reduces undesirable tem- 
perature gradients. 

2.7.3. Thermal boundary conditions and contact resistance 

For the external boundaries of the entire cell: In the ﬂuid pas- 
sages,  the  inlet  gas  conditions  are  generally  assigned  as  Dirich- 
in  on ∂(cid:23) (ﬁxed value): outlet ﬂuid values are 
let conditions T = T 
arbitrary (no boundary value required) for situations where axial 
conduction is negligible. For low Pe, an outlet value is required,

i h 

i is the product of 
where e is internal energy, h total enthalpy, j 
the  diffusion  ﬂux,  Eq.  (35) ,  and  individual  species  enthalpy.  The 
terms on the right-side of Eq. (73) are, respectively, due to radia- 
tive ﬂux, heat conduction, species diffusion, volumetric sources of 
heat, and viscous dissipation. In porous media, the thermal con- 
ductivity  is  an  effective  value,  k = k 
eff.  The  reader  will  note  that 
mass transfer losses are often converted into concentration over- 
potentials, but generally one does not speak in terms of thermal 
or temperature overpotentials, even though heat and mass transfer 
are similar processes. 

2.7.1. Heat sources and sinks 

The  heat  sources,  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) ,  in  Eq.  (73) ,  take  into  account  (i)  Joule 
heating, (ii) heating due to electrochemical/chemical reactions and 
(iii) latent heat due to the formation of gaseous water. Depending 
on the model, reactions are assumed to occur at either the elec- 
trode/electrolyte interfaces (per unit area) or within the electrodes 
(per unit volume). The total heat generated is the difference be- 
tween the enthalpy of the reaction, (cid:20)H , and the electrical energy, 
as discussed in section 2.1. The total heat dissipated can be written 
as in Eq. (26) , namely  ˙ q = i ( E H − V ) , with E H = (cid:20)H / 2 F . This can be 
prescribed as a volumetric source,  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) , by replacing the total cur- 
rent i with the local current density, i (cid:3) (cid:3) , and dividing by an appro- 
priate electrolyte or electrode thickness. 

A better method is to break down individual heat sources and 
apply  these  locally  within  different  components.  Commonly  re- 
ferred to; are reversible,  ˙ q re v , heat sources/sinks and irreversible, 
˙ q 
irr , heat sources, see Eq. (26) . With reference to Eq. (14) , the term 
–T (cid:20)S  is  the  chemical  energy  released/consumed  in  the  form  of 
heat, referred to as the reversible heating/cooling in a SOFC/SOEC. 

˙ q re v =  − T (cid:20)S 

i 

2F 

(74) 

In theory (cid:20)S may be deﬁned for a single-electrode half-cell re- 
action, and the entropic heat will generally be different for alter- 
nate electrodes. In practice, though, the parameterisation is chal- 
lenging,  e.g.,  the  value  of  the  molar  entropy  of  ions.  Therefore 
Eq. (74) is typically applied across the whole cell in its entirety. The 
irreversible heating is associated with losses in the cell; a fraction 
of the electrochemical energy is converted into heat in both fuel 
cells and electrolysers,  ˙ q 
˙ q irr = (E − V ) i = ηi

Thus  the  total  heat  generated  may  be  re-written  as 
˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) = ( −T (cid:20)S / 2 F + η) i (cid:3)(cid:3)  for  an  active  catalyst  layer  of  negligible

T = T out  on ∂(cid:23), which is problematic. Some solid surfaces might be 
treated as adiabatic,  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) = 0  on ∂(cid:23) or constant temperature. More 
generally, a linear-type relation  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) = U( T ∞ − T )  on ∂(cid:23). The over- 
all  heat-transfer  coeﬃcient,  U ,  could  include  forced  and  natural 
convection, as well as a radiation component. Internal boundary 
conditions, for example at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, are 
based on conservation principles:

(79) 

where  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) is the surface heat generation due to the electrochemical 
reactions at that interface as described above; see Eqs. (74) and 
(75) . 

Thermal contact resistances also exist at the internal interfaces 
of  SOC  parts.  Such  resistances  are  diﬃcult  to  assess  analytically 
and depend on temperature, geometry, and the material properties 
of the contact, as well as solid stresses and strains. The contact re- 
sistance of ceramic interfaces between materials used in SOCs is 
discussed in Koch [202] . Not much work directly devoted to SOCs 
is available, however, some information can also be obtained from 
other engineering ﬁelds [203-205] and expressed in terms of a ﬁ- 
nite temperature jump, (cid:20)T =  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) / h c , in series with the thermal re- 
sistances of the joined solids. The relative magnitudes of the con- 
tact  conductance,  h c ,  and  the  solid  conductance  k / l  (for  a  layer 
of thickness l ) determine whether contact resistance is signiﬁcant. 
Values of the thermal contact resistance are typically in the range 
of 5 × 10 −6 - 5 × 10 −4 m 2 K/W: 

2.7.4. Heat transfer in solid oxide stacks 

A simple analysis of the thermal behaviour of an SOC can pro- 
vide a ﬁrst estimate of temperature distributions for 0-D or 1-D 
cell  models.  It  can  also  be  employed  locally  in  stack-level  heat 
transfer  models  [ 76 , 88 , 89 ].  In  the  gas  channels,  convective  heat 
transfer coeﬃcients, h , are assumed to be available or readily de- 
termined  by  correlations.  Then,  the  steady  ﬂow  of  heat  ﬂux  is 
given by: 
(cid:3)(cid:3) = U ( T w − T ) 
˙ q 
where T w  is the electrode interface temperature, T is a bulk gas 
temperature and U is an overall heat-transfer coeﬃcient:

For  unsteady  heat  transfer,  Newton’s  law  of  cooling  may  be 
applied.  Radiation  can  also  be  considered  as  being  in  parallel, 
U = U con + U 
rad , see Eq. (86) , below. The ﬁrst term on the right side 
of Eq. (81) is due to convection while the second is due to conduc- 
tion. H is the solid thickness, k eff 
s  the effective conductivity and s a 
conduction shape factor that may be measured experimentally, or 
obtained by means of a computer simulation [206] . The heat trans- 
fer coeﬃcients, h , are commonly presented in a non-dimensional 
form as a Nusselt number, Nu, and this depends on the ﬂow ﬁeld, 
ﬂuid properties and geometry [206] . Shah and London [207] cor- 
relate the Nusselt number, Nu, in rectangular and other channels. 
Typical formulae assume:

In the electrolyte/electrodes, heat transport primarily occurs by 
conduction and heat generation by ohmic heating caused by the 
electron  transport,  div (k grad T ) +  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) = 0 .  The  reader  should  note 
that for the electrodes, the conductivity is frequently computed as 
a weighted average of the solid and ﬂuid values, see Eq. (91) , be- 
low.

2.7.5. Thermal radiation 

The  high  operating  temperature  of  SOCs  suggests  that  radia- 
tive  heat  transfer  may  be  a  signiﬁcant  mode  of  energy  transfer. 
Although water vapour and carbon dioxide occur at high concen- 
trations in the fuel electrode, most models ignore their contribu- 
tions, despite the fact that these are known to absorb, emit and 
scatter radiation in various wavelength bands. In most cases where 
thermal radiation has been considered, only surface-to-surface ra- 
diation was treated. Some models have considered radiation in the 
porous regions and include the absorptivity of the porous material. 
Damm and Fedorov [208] review some of these issues. Radiation 
in SOCs is one area where SOC researchers rely almost entirely on 
model results, as reliable experiments are non-existent. 

2.7.6. Surface radiation in internal fuel cell passages 

In  the  channels  if  the  gases  are  considered  to  be  radiatively 
non-participating, surface-to-surface radiation calculations may be 
performed for planar SOC geometries [209-215] and for tubular ge- 
ometries [ 214 , 216-219 ]. The analyses are based on the presumption 
of diffuse-grey radiative exchange. The basic equation for element 
i may be written,

where H 
oi is the external radiosity at any ‘holes’ in the enclosure 
periphery. Many authors simplify the analysis by assuming a sim- 
ple  planar  [ 212 , 215 , 221 ]  or  axisymmetric  exchange  [ 215 , 217 , 218 ] 
at ﬁxed temperature(s). Yakabe et al. [209] mysteriously replaced 
the radiosities in Eq. (85) with emissive power. The problems with 
Eq. (85) are: (a) the additional effort associated with the one-time 
computation of F 
i-j , for complex geometries; (b) the extra run-time 
effort to update the radiative heat ﬂux. In general, surface radiation 
may be spectral, and specular rather than diffuse-grey. Of course, 
the material properties of the porous gas diffusion layer will dif- 
fer from the channel walls, and if mesh or gauze is employed in 
place of ribs, these will affect the problem. As the micro-channels 
are very narrow, only a few immediate neighbours (opposite and 
sides) in any given channel will be of any consequence, and the 
computation can then be simpliﬁed. 

2.7.7. Participative radiation and radiative control 

While the gas channels may be analysed by means of a surface 
radiation  analysis,  depending  on  property  values,  the  electrolyte 
and electrodes of an SOC constitute participating media for which 
a radiative transfer equation [220] may be derived 

Numerical solutions to the this are often conducted using dis- 
crete  ordinate  or  Monte  Carlo  methods  to  calculate  the  radiant 
ﬂux  vector  in  Eq.  (73) .  These  are  extremely  computer-intensive 
procedures. Fortunately, the literature [ 222 , 223 ] suggest that less 
than 1K difference in electrolyte temperature is associated with the 
electrode-electrolyte assembly. Thus, it is widely maintained that 
for the material properties encountered in SOCs today, participa- 
tive radiation is inconsequential. The electrolyte may be treated as 

S.B. Beale, M. Andersson, C. Boigues-Muñoz et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100902 

being optically thin, while the electrodes may be considered as so 
optically thick as to be opaque for all practical purposes. 

For  optically-thin  regions,  a  multi-ﬂux  model  or  Schuster- 
Schwarzschild approximation may be constructed. For thin-plane 
layers, a two-ﬂux model may be suﬃcient. For optically-thick re- 
gions, a diffusion approximation is considered appropriate, with ra- 
diative conductivity deﬁned in terms of a Rosseland mean absorp- 
tion coeﬃcient, to be added to the conduction term. An optically- 
thin region would be e.g., a YSZ electrolyte, whereas the Ni-YSZ 
and LSM electrodes may be considered as optically-thick. The pre- 
sumption that the electrodes are transparent and the electrolyte 
opaque  is  based  on  the  optical  properties  of  the  materials  em- 
ployed today. Should those change, a reassessment would be re- 
quired.  Optical  properties  provide  a  mechanism  to  control  local 
stack  temperature/gradients,  Spinnler  et  al.  [ 224 , 225 ].  The  above 
analysis already adds considerably to the complexity of the calcu- 
lation procedure. Even so, for situations where radiation is impor- 
tant; it is probably over-simplistic: In reality, the electrolyte assem- 
bly is a porous media with non-homogeneous optical properties, 
including dependent scattering, while the interconnect is typically 
metallic and hence there may be both specular and diffuse compo- 
nents to the surface radiosity. 

2.7.8. External radiative exchange between cell stack and enclosure 

Achenbach [74] noted that radiation losses from an SOC stack 
are signiﬁcant. Numerous authors [ 89 , 213 , 215 , 216 ] account for this 
by  implementing  a  simple  radiation  boundary  condition  at  the 
outer stack walls, namely,  ˙ q (cid:3)(cid:3) = εσ F ( T 4 
w ) , where T ∞ is an am- 
bient temperature and F is a shape factor. The emissivity, ε, can be 
estimated, e.g., by placing a cold specimen of the steel outer casing 
in a pre-heated furnace and observing the transient temperature 
proﬁle [220] . A radiation heat transfer coeﬃcient may be deﬁned 
according to: 

∞ − T 4 

rad =

(cid:5)

(86) 

While SOC stacks are generally ﬁeld-operated in an insulated envi- 
ronment, they are frequently laboratory-tested in a furnace. This 
leads  to  a  number  of  issues  for  the  purposes  of  model  valida- 
tion and veriﬁcation: (i) Both natural and forced convection heat 
transfer will likely be present at the sides and top of the stack, in 
addition to thermal radiation; (ii) irradiation of the cell/stack as- 
sembly by the guard heaters in the furnaces is seldom uniform; 
(iii) heat transfer by conduction through the base will be signif- 
icant; (iv) the cell is made of a lamination of different materials 
which have different properties and the outer surfaces are rough, 
not smooth; (v) the surface-optical properties of SOCs will change 
with time, e.g., due to oxidation and possibly soot deposition (from 
the furnace) depending on the type of furnace employed. Peksen 
[68] compared a combined radiation-natural convection condition 
in a furnace environment to a simple adiabatic model. The furnace 
problem is illustrative of how experiments used for evaluation of 
SOCs are not suitable for validation and veriﬁcation of computer 
models. It should be noted that SOCs are now operated at lower 
temperatures than in the past, so radiation heat transfer becomes 
less important of an issue in the future. 

2.7.9. Cell and stack cooling 

Cooling  an  SOFC  stack  is  primarily  achieved  by  internal  heat 
transfer to the air. At the same time, the external boundaries of 
the hot stack and insulation are in contact with ambient conditions 
and some cooling of a stack at the external heat surfaces may need 
to be considered in the model, depending on the U -value of insula- 
tion employed. Cooling of a cell/stack will be a combination of in- 
ternal gas convection and external conduction and radiation to the 
outer surfaces of the cell/stack where mixed (forced/free) convec- 
tion is present. Assuming external insulation is employed, the heat 

transferred by external convection term will likely be small. Heat 
losses to the ground through the base plate may have some inﬂu- 
ence on the temperatures of lower cells in a stack. Generally speak- 
ing, the overall heat transfer coeﬃcient, U , will vary as a function 
of position; however, this is usually considered constant. This may 
readily be evaluated by the construction of a computational heat 
transfer model of a stack at constant stack temperature, or a phys- 
ical experiment. The combined contributions of convection and ra- 
diation may be considered as being in parallel, with arithmetic av- 
eraging employed, U = U con + U 
rad . 

Heat transfer is a very important consideration in SOCs. Min- 
imisation  of  thermal  gradients  and  ‘hot  spots’  are  of  paramount 
importance, especially for planar designs. Metallic interconnectors 
act  as  ﬁns  and  can  reduce  thermal  gradients.  Cooling  is  gener- 
ally effected by convection of the air/oxidant, though conduction 
and  radiation  within  and  without  the  cell/stack  are  also  impor- 
tant. As is true, elsewhere in this review, a range of possible equa- 
tions from simple rate equations to detailed integral and differen- 
tial equations may be solved. Local temperatures will directly affect 
electrical conductivity, Nernst potential, and current density (reac- 
tion rates) and therefore thermal calculations should be carefully 
employed based on suitably-obtained property values. It is recom- 
mended to verify mathematical models against stacks operated in 
a  well-insulated  environment,  where  heat  losses  from  the  stack 
will be  small  in  comparison to  the  fraction  of  heat  that  is  con- 
vected away by the  internal ﬂow  of air/oxidant (and to a  lesser 
extent, fuel), rather than in a furnace, where it is diﬃcult to deﬁne 
thermal boundary conditions. 

2.8. Microstructural analysis of porous electrodes and transport layers 

Effective transport properties, may be related to bulk properties 

[226-228] : 
(cid:13) k, σ , D (cid:14) 

eff = M (cid:13) k, σ , D (cid:14) 
0 

(87) 

The M -factor represents the microstructure inﬂuence. It requires 
evaluation for both gaseous (thermal conductivity, k , species dif- 
fusivity, D ) and solid phases (ionic/electronic conductivity, σ , and 
thermal conductivity, k ). Some solid regions (i) contain mixtures 
of, e.g., ceramic and metallic components; and (ii) some proper- 
ties, such as, k , must be averaged between the ﬂuid and one or 
more solid phases. 

2.8.1. Exchange coeﬃcients in porous multiphase electrodes 

In porous media, there is an increased diffusion length and a 
reduced  void  volume  due  to  microstructural  effects.  Historically, 
exchange coeﬃcients (conductivities, diffusivities, and viscosities) 
were  often  corrected  by  tortuosity,  τ ,  and  porosity,  ε.  The  geo- 
metric tortuosity for phase k is deﬁned as the ratio between the 
mean path length L mean and the shortest linear distance between 
two points on a representative element of volume. 

τ = 

L mean 
L min 

(88) 

Tortuosity is always greater than or equal to 1. Note that multi- 
ple deﬁnitions of tortuosity exist; for example geodesic tortuosity, 
experimental tortuosity, effective tortuosity; simulated, for exam- 
ple, with CFD or Lattice Boltzmann Method [ 227 , 229 ]. A compar- 
ison between the geometric and geodesic tortuosity can be found 
in Stenzel et al . [227] . 

The M -factor is sometimes written as: 

M = 

ε 
τ m 

(89) 

m  has  been  associated  with  a  power  of  1  for  the  straight- 
capillary-tube  model: M = ε/τ ,  Wyllie  and  Spangler  [230] ,  to  de- 
scribe  electrical  current  in  brine-saturated  rock.  This  has  limita- 
tions, as Epstein [150] noted. A more suitable model for gas ﬂow in

porous media may be the inclined-capillary tube model, M = ε/ τ 2 , 
developed by Cornell and Katz [231] , among others, from data on 
limestone,  sandstone,  and  dolomites.  Neither  of  these  were  de- 
veloped  to  describe  SOC  electrodes. τ 2  is  commonly  referred  to 
√ ε so 
as the ‘tortuosity factor’. Bruggeman [151] suggested, τ = 1 / 
that  M = ε1.5 ,  which  is  not  valid  for  diffusive  transport  in  com- 
posite SOC electrodes for low porosities. Archie [232] considered 
M = εm , which has also proven popular and is another specialisa- 
tion of Eq. (89) . Note that the inﬂuence of the microstructural M - 
factor, differs for each distinct phase, i.e., for an SOFC anode, dif- 
ferent values are obtained for the pore, Ni and YSZ phase, respec- 
tively [ 226 , 228 , 233 , 234 ]. The tortuosity may also vary with direc- 
tion, i.e., τ = ( τ x , τ y , τ z ). However, reliable information regarding 
the direction-dependent electrode tortuosity is rare. 

The formulation of Schmidt and co-workers [ 226 , 229 ], accounts 
for  tortuosity,  phase  connectivity,  constrictivity  and  active  TPB 
length obtained from 3-D image analysis [ 226 , 228 ]. A large dataset 
with stochastically-generated microstructures was used in Stenzel 
et al. [228] to determine the M -factor. This yields predicted errors 
of less than 9% compared to 13.6% in earlier studies [228] : 

M = a

(90) 

where  β is  a  constriction  factor,  which  can  be  physically  inter- 
preted as the ratio between the average sizes of the bottlenecks 
min / r max ) 2 . Values of b < 2 are com- 
and the bulges in the pores, ( r 
mon [229] . c is typically in the range 0.6-0.7, and d around 2. M - 
factors for Ni, YSZ, and pore structures before and after redox, are 
discussed in Pecho et al . [226] . Structural parameters, such as in 
Eq. (89) do not have a simple geometric meaning: their calcula- 
tion is a function of geometric concepts from image analysis such 
as median axis and shortest pathway. Thus, the introduction of a 
pre-exponential factor, a , can be justiﬁed [ 227 , 229 ]. 

The bulk effective thermal conductivity of heterogeneous mate- 
rials can be calculated according to a series or parallel approach. 
For resistance in parallel, it is computed as an arithmetic average 
of the solid and ﬂuid values: 
k = k eff = ε k 

f + ( 1 − ε ) k s 

(91) 

The thermal conductivity of the gas mixture, k 

f , may be calcu- 
lated, for example, by the correlation of Mason and Saxena [235] . 
The series and parallel approaches correspond to the lower and up- 
per bounds (Wiener bonds) [ 236 , 237 ].

In porous composite electrodes, if the effective electrical con- 
ductivities for the electronic and ionic phases, Eqs. (59) and (60) , 
can be expressed in terms of an Archie/Bruggeman type correla- 
tion, this may be modiﬁed as [238] : 
(cid:16)
(cid:15)
( 1 − ε ) φ j P j 
j  = σ j 
σ eff 
where ε is the gas void fraction, φ
j is the volume fraction of solid 
j  is a percolation factor (i.e., the fraction of path- 
species j and P 
ways  that  are  open  not  closed).  A  value  of  m = 1.5  -  3  is  typi- 
cally adopted in the literature. Of course, any of the other relation- 
ships Eqs. (89) - (89) may be likewise suitably modiﬁed. Eq. (91) and 
other  variants  were  frequently  employed  in  the  past  owing  to 
a  lack  of  better  data.  Accurate  effective  transport  parameters  of 
porous  SOC  electrodes,  not  restricted  by  such  heuristic  assump- 
tions, can be either determined by means of direct measurements, 
Kornely  et  al.  [239] ,  Dierickx  et  al.  [38]  or  by  performing  a  nu- 
merical simulation in a 3-D digital reconstruction of the electrode, 
Choi et al. [152] , Joos et al. [240] . In the latter approach, a poten- 
tial difference (cid:20)φ may be applied to two opposing faces of the 
reconstructed geometry. The resulting current, i , can be obtained 
by directly solving the electronic transport equation with reference 
to Eqs. (61) and (62) in phase j , namely: div ( σ
j ) = 0 . The 
effective conductivity σ eff 
j  can be calculated from the straight-line

(93) 

This approach is feasible for most transport processes in porous 
electrodes (electronic, ionic and heat conduction, as well as gas dif- 
fusion). A suﬃciently high reconstruction resolution is essential to 
account for constriction effects at contact points between particles. 
This is usually not a problem for sintered structures such as SOC 
electrodes. 

2.8.2. Structural property analysis of composite electrodes 

A composite electrode is usually fabricated by sintering a mix- 
ture of electron-conducting particles and ion-conducting particles 
at high temperature. In the case of cermets such as Ni/zirconia or 
Ni/ceria (the fuel electrodes of choice nowadays in most SOCs), the 
metal is sintered in the oxidised state (NiO) and reduced during 
the start-up procedure. The electrode performance depends on its 
effective electronic and ionic conductivities, TPB length, and pore 
radius. These are functions of morphological properties, including 
composition, particle size and overlap, porosity, and sintering con- 
ditions, as well as intrinsic properties, e.g., conductivities. Methods 
for characterising the electrode morphology and effective proper- 
ties  typically  fall  into  the  three  categories:  (i)  computer  simula- 
tions of random packings of spherical particles; (ii) predictions by 
random packing-based percolation theory; and (iii) reconstructions 
of electrode microstructures based on tomographic methods. Elec- 
trode images show that the particles are non-spherical after sinter- 
ing [241] . Nevertheless, models with random packing of spherical 
particles  [ 152 , 242 ]  can  yield  important  qualitative  and  quantita- 
tive insight. In computer simulations, electrode structures are gen- 
erated by some packing algorithm. The morphological parameters 
and effective properties are then evaluated against the simulated 
structures [ 189 , 241 , 243-246 ]. The deduced effective properties can 
then be used as inputs for performance model studies. 

Unlike  numerical  simulation  methods  for  packing  generation, 
percolation theory is an analytical predictive method, with effec- 
tive  properties  deduced  directly  from  measurable  input  parame- 
ters, such as porosity, particle size, and composition. The develop- 
ment of percolation theory is helped by simulations that provide 
numerical validation of the analytical model. Percolation theory re- 
lies on the evaluation of coordination numbers of particles to pre- 
dict effective properties. Suzuki and Oshima developed a theoreti- 
cal model to estimate coordination numbers in multi-component 
mixtures  [ 247 , 248 ].  The  Bouvard-Lange  model  has  been  widely 
used to calculate coordination numbers for binary systems [249] . 
Costamanga et al . [ 189 , 243 ] proposed percolation models for SOFC 
electrodes. Chen et al . [250] and Chan et al . [246] also proposed 
SOFC micromodels. Janardhanan et al. [251] used percolation the- 
ory to predict TPB lengths. Chen et al . [252] also developed a per- 
colation model that satisﬁes the contact-number conservation re- 
quirement. Bertei and Nicolella [132] proposed a percolation model 
that improves on Suzuki and Oshima’s theory [247] . 

In  a  typical  percolation  model,  the  composite  electrode 
is  treated  as  a  binary  system  with  a  random  mixture  of 
electronic-conducting electrode particles (denoted as ed ) and ionic- 
conducting electrolyte particles (denoted as el ). The average num- 
ber of l-particles in contact with a k -particle can be estimated as 
[252] :

the volume fraction of the ed (el) particles in the solid electrode 
structure. 

The TPB length for a pair of contacting el and ed particles is the 
contact perimeter between the particles. The contact perimeter can 
be evaluated as l

be calculated as r 
is usually assigned a value of 15 ° [253] . The TPB is only effective 
when the contacting particles form a percolating network, the ef- 
fective TPB length per unit volume can be estimated as [ 189 , 252 ]:

conﬁrmed in Sanyal et al. [255] . The above analysis assumes a sin- 
gle particle size for each component. Generalisation of the perco- 
lation theory to that for a multi-component mixture can be found 
in refs. [ 132 , 252 ]. 

2.8.3. Structural properties and performance of inﬁltrated electrodes 

In  nanoparticle-inﬁltrated  electrodes,  nano-sized  electronic- 
conducting particles, e.g., Ni, are coated on the surface of micron- 
sized scaffold ionic conducting particles, e.g., YSZ [256-258] . Inﬁl- 
trated electrodes offer numerous advantages over co-sintered com- 
posite  electrodes,  as  long  as  the  nanoscaled  inﬁltration  exhibits 
suﬃcient durability. A high TPB density is obtained due to the use 
of small particles. The scaffold structure stabilises the mechanical 
properties of the fuel electrode during redox cycling and mitigates 
the mismatch of the thermal expansion coeﬃcients of electrolyte 
and electrode. As the microstructure of an inﬁltrated electrode is 
different  from  that  of  a  conventional  composite  electrode,  dedi- 
cated theoretical analyses are necessary. 

Numerical analyses were carried out, that cover electrode mor- 
phology, effective properties, electrochemical performance. Zhang 
et al . [171] proposed a 3-D kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model to 
generate morphology; porosity and tortuosity factor are calculated 
during KMC sintering. The KMC model was improved by consider- 
ing a weighted risk factor for the aggregation of inﬁltrated particles 
[259] . A parametric study was conducted to examine the TPB den- 
sity, percolation probabilities of inﬁltrated nanoparticles and pores, 
Synodis et al. [260] , describing a mechanistic model to mimic each 
fabrication step. The percolation thresholds and effective conduc- 
tivities were computed for varied inﬁltrated particle size, poros- 
ity,  and  pore  size.  The  capability  was  extended  by  Reszka  et  al . 
[261]  to  include  the  prediction  of  TPB  density  and  other  mor- 
phological quantities. Bertei et al . [ 262 , 263 ] estimated TPB length, 
ratio  of  electronic  to  ionic  conductivity,  and  mean  pore  size  for 
electrodes with composite electronic/ionic backbone particles in- 
ﬁltrated in the electronic conductor phase. Bertei et al . [264] re- 
ported an approach to quantify the electrochemical microstructural 

27 

degradation of nanostructured electrodes. Combining this with ex- 
perimental  3-D  tomography  and  EIS,  the  simulations  provide  a 
quantitative description of the roughness and fractural nature of 
the TPB in Ni-inﬁltrated ScSZ fuel electrodes. 

2 NiO 

Nicollet et al . [265] and Mortensen et al . [266] performed elec- 
trochemical performance and impedance modelling, which led to 
the  determination  of  transport  properties.  Surface  exchange  re- 
4  calculated from the impedance measure- 
action rates of La 
ments are in agreement with the literature. Bertei et al . [263] con- 
ducted electrochemical performance simulations with a simpliﬁed 
representative geometry, Tanner et al . [267] . Guidelines for the ra- 
tional design of inﬁltrated electrodes were deduced. Rahmanipour 
et al. [268] proposed a distributed charge transfer model to sim- 
ulate the electrochemical performance and impedance spectra of 
SOFCs  with  MIEC  electrolytes  and  inﬁltrated  electrodes,  used  to 
provide insight into the optimal design of materials/dimensions. 

Analytical models for the analysis of inﬁltrated electrodes be- 
gan by following the simpliﬁed geometric representation of Tanner 
et al . [267] and used a 1-D model equation derived for the acti- 
vation overpotential of inﬁltrated electrodes [269-271] . The mod- 
els are successful for air electrodes inﬁltrated with various electro- 
catalysts, however, they omit the description of the microstructure- 
dependent effective conductivity and active TPB length. Hardjo et 
al . [272] developed a theoretical model based on the formation of 
a semi-continuous inﬁltrate ﬁlm on the surface of an electrolyte 
scaffold. The model was combined with numerical simulations to 
account  for  the  effect  of  microstructures  on  the  electrode  prop- 
erties. Effective electronic conductivity and TPB density were re- 
ported as a function of inﬁltrate particle size, scaffold particle size 
and porosity. A degradation model associated with inﬁltrate parti- 
cle coarsening was also presented. 

Simple analytical models that consider an inﬁltrated electrode 
as a random packing of some equivalent super-particles were de- 
veloped by Chen et al . [ 258 , 273-275 ]. Each super-particle consists 
of a core representative of a scaffold backbone unit and a shell of 
inﬁltrated nano-particles on the core surface. Combining this with 
percolation theory, section 2.8.2, all effective properties of an in- 
ﬁltrated electrode can be determined. For example, expressions for 
the electronic and ionic conductivities of the packing unit as func- 
tions of nano-particle loading were derived [ 273 , 274 ]. The conduc- 
tivities of the packing unit are combined with Eq. (93) or equiv- 
alent to yield the effective conductivities. The percolation thresh- 
old of nano-particles in the shell of the packing unit agrees with 
experiments [ 252 , 273 ]. The effective TPB density is determined by 
the TPB density in the packing unit and the electrode porosity. The 
TPB  densities  for  both  single-  and  binary-phase  inﬁltrated  elec- 
trodes  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  experimental  data  [258] . 
The  hydraulic  radius  of  the  pore  should  not  be  determined  by 
Eq. (97) , but should be calculated based on the radius of the super- 
particle and the electrode porosity [275] . It is shown that only the 
super-particle radius-determined hydraulic radius can produce the 
experimental polarisation relation [275] . The effective TPB density, 
electrical conductivities and pore radius are all expressed analyt- 
ically  and  validated  by  experimental  data,  and  can  be  therefore 
used to design inﬁltrated electrodes [ 258 , 275 ]. 

2.8.4. Numerical reconstruction of electrode microstructures 

The porous electrode structure plays an important role in SOC 
performance: A large TPB length is needed, and at the same time, 
the effective conductivity for electrons and ions and gas perme- 
ability  should  be  as  high  as  possible.  These  factors  depend  on 
microstructural  properties,  which are  formed  during  the  fabrica- 
tion sintering process. High temperatures exceeding 1200 °C are re- 
quired to densify the electrolyte and even at operating tempera- 
tures of 600 to 10 0 0 °C, the sintering of porous electrode structures 
may continue. A straightforward approach to applying nanoscale 

S.B. Beale, M. Andersson, C. Boigues-Muñoz et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100902 

structures exhibiting high volumetric TPB and surface area densi- 
ties, respectively, is generally not feasible. 

To  gain  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the  microstructural 
properties, advanced experimental techniques with different spa- 
tial resolution, such as X-ray tomography [276] , focused ion beam- 
scanning  electron  microscopy  [ 241 , 277 ],  and  high-angle  annular 
dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography 
[278]  can  be  employed  to  understand  the  different  microstruc- 
tural  properties;  TPB  length,  tortuosity,  and  phase  connectivity. 
Model-based  generation  of  microstructures  can  provide  different 
microstructures in a shorter timeframe. Rüger et al. [279] applied a 
geometry generator to establish simpliﬁed cube-based porous elec- 
trode microstructures for simulation studies in LSCF electrodes. Us- 
ing a KMC model, Zhang et al . [171] found that at a typical poros- 
ity, the effective electrical conductivity is low with M = 0.1, Eq. (87) . 
Reconstructing the microstructure of the fuel electrode functional 
layer and substrate of four different anode-supported cells, values 
of 0.16 ≤ M ≤ 0.26 were found for the YSZ-phase effective conduc- 
tivity in the fuel electrode functional layer, whereas lower values 
0.08 ≤ M ≤ 0.12 were found in the substrate, Joos [280] . Dierickx 
et al. [38] , report a further reduction of the ionic conductivity re- 
lated to Ni-interdiffusion during sintering [281] . With respect to 
the Ni-phase, the conductivities were even further reduced 0.02 ≤
M ≤ 0.08, which is still suﬃciently large as the bulk conductivity 
of Ni is orders of magnitude more than that of YSZ. 

Losses  in  porous  electrodes  are  signiﬁcantly  affected  by  the 
transport  of  ions  through  the  ionically  conducting  matrix.  Many 
state-of-the-art  SOCs  are  fabricated  with  thin  ﬁlm  electrolytes 
(about  10  μm),  and  the  losses  in  the  porous  electrode,  due  to 
ion conduction, are comparable to that of the electrolyte. Exten- 
sive  efforts  are  being  made  to  extend  the  electrochemical  reac- 
tion  into  the  porous  electrode,  which  will  increase  the  distance 
for ion transport. Dierickx [38] analysed Ni/YSZ cermet electrodes 
experimentally,  and  performed  simulations  with  a  transmission 
line model, Euler and Nonnenmacher [282] , revealed penetration 
depths  of  between  3  and  14  μm  for  different  material  and  mi- 
crostructural properties. In another study [283] , it was found that 
the peak TPB length can be increased by reducing the backbone 
particle size. 

The KMC model can predict the electrode microstructural evo- 
lution during sintering procedures. As the electrode microstructure 
is digitised, calculation of the TPB length, tortuosity, porosity, dif- 
fusion  coeﬃcient,  connectivity,  etc.  is  straightforward.  Validation 
of the microstructures requires the reconstruction of a number of 
samples. The KMC method is computationally demanding. More- 
over, it is not suitable to predict microstructure properties of elec- 
trodes  fabricated  using  new  materials,  due  to  the  lack  of  mate- 
rial  data,  such  as  the  interfacial  energy.  Therefore  a  microstruc- 
ture generation method based on spherical particle random pack- 
ing  and  dilation  was  developed.  It  is  simple,  material  property- 
independent and applicable to various materials, however, it is not 
a reconstruction of an actual microstructure. The effective conduc- 
tivity of composite electrodes was studied in Zheng and Ni [284] . 
It was found that M  =  σ eff/ σ ≤ 0.1. However in the case of the 
Jülich fuel electrode functional layer, the volume fraction of 8YSZ 
is closer to 50% and the tortuosity around 2, resulting in M ≈ 0.25 
[38] . Additionally, the impact of the interdiffused NiO further de- 
creases  the  8YSZ  bulk  conductivity,  [281] .  These  results  indicate 
that the ohmic loss in porous electrodes due to ion transport in 
the  electrodes  is  signiﬁcant.  Effort s  are  underway  to  extend  the 
electrochemical reaction into the porous electrode, increasing the 
distance for ion transport. Increased ionic conductivity should be 
considered in the development of new electrode materials and mi- 
crostructure arrangements. 

In  one  study  [283] ,  a  spherical  particle  random  packing  and 
dilation method was extended to study the properties of nanos- 

tructured SOFC electrodes fabricated by the inﬁltration method. In 
another study [259] , the structural properties of dual-phase inﬁl- 
trated electrodes were considered. It should also be noted that the 
percolation  TPB  length  is  zero  at  a  low  inﬁltration  loading  (i.e., 
<  6  vol.%),  although  the  total  TPB  length  is  still  high  (30 0-40 0 
μm/μm 3 ), as the nanoparticles are not well-connected to form con- 
tinuous paths for electron/ion conduction. The study demonstrated 
the feasibility of increasing TPB length by dual-phase inﬁltration. 
However, loading must be controlled to achieve peak TPB length, 
high  effective  conductivity  and  gas  transport  permeability.  Opti- 
misation  can  be  achieved  by  multiphysics  simulations  of  recon- 
structed electrode structures [285] . 

The availability of 3-D microstructure reconstructions in the last 
decade  provided  highly  accurate  microstructural  parameters  that 
are applicable in cell-level models. The approach was previously 
limited  to  artiﬁcially-generated  cube  or  sphere  models.  Multi- 
physics modelling approaches in 3-D reconstructions were initially 
developed by Shikazono et al. [286] and Shearing et al. [277] to 
model  the  performance  of  Ni/YSZ  cermet  fuel  electrodes.  Shika- 
zono et al. applied a Lattice Boltzmann Method, whereas Shearing 
et al. used a FVM with individual voxels of the reconstruction as 
the ﬁnite volumes. The TPBs represented electrochemically-active 
sites with localised Butler-Volmer behaviour, using length-speciﬁc 
current density. In the paper by Matsuzaki et al . [287] , a Lattice 
Boltzmann Method for MIEC air electrodes in which gas diffusion 
coupled by a Butler-Volmer-type equation was presented. In these 
approaches; reconstruction down-sampling was performed to re- 
duce computational efforts. In the work of Kishimoto et al. [288] , a 
sub-grid scale model was applied to keep the quality of the struc- 
tural  information  that  would  be  otherwise  lost.  Considering  the 
large number of parameters, an unambiguous parameterisation by 
means  of  ﬁtting  is  diﬃcult,  as  different  parameter  combinations 
may result in the same performance. In the paper by Häffelin et al. 
[289] , a 3-D FEM microstructure model of a Ni/8YSZ-cermet fuel 
electrode was fully parameterised by measured data. With this ap- 
proach, a good agreement with measured ASR values was obtained. 
Another possibility to prove the validity of a 3-D microstructure 
model  is  to  simulate  the  AC  impedance  over  a  wide  frequency 
range.  Häffelin et  al.  [290]  present a  time-dependent impedance 
model of mixed-conducting air electrodes and compare it to a ho- 
mogenised approach based on Gerischer impedance, as discussed 
in Adler et al. [291] . Such a microstructural model provides valu- 
able information about the impact of material and microstructural 
properties on the impedance of mixed-conducting air electrodes. 

2.9. Overpotentials 

The concept of ‘overpotential’ was introduced in Eq. (6) . Cur- 
rent is produced/consumed when there is a change in the differ- 
ence in electrochemical potentials between the two electrodes or 
phases within an electrode. The term contains multiple meanings 
throughout  the  literature,  but  essentially  represents  irreversible 
enthalpic losses that either require additional energy to overcome 
(SOEC) or decrease the amount of usable work from the systems 
(SOFC). For any given electrode k ;

i.e.,  ηact, a ,  η
act, f  for  the  air  and  fuel  side  respectively.  The  refer- 
ence value, E ref , is with respect to a given reference condition elec- 
trode, usually taken as a standard hydrogen electrode, but which 
could also account for local concentrations effects on thermody- 
namic potential, as given e.g., in Eqs. (17) and (18) . In addition to 
activation losses, the term ‘overpotential’ is an accepted designa- 
tion for losses due to a number of causes; concentration gradient

This helps deconvolute the contributions to the cell potential, 
however the overpotentials are not entirely separable due to their 
interconnectivity. For a detailed 3-D model, the concept is not par- 
ticularly useful, though it does provide one way to visualise losses 
on a common scale, as shown for a 1 cm 2  SOC in Fig. 4 (b). The 
nature of the three main overpotentials are discussed below. 

The activation and concentration overpotentials, and Nernst po- 
tential are functions of partial pressure of reactants/products and 
temperature and thus are local values as depicted in Fig. 11 . These, 
in turn affect the local current density distribution, see for example 
the hydrogen, Nernst potential, and current density distributions in 
Fig. 11 (d-f). 

2.9.1. Activation overpotential 

The activation overpotentials, ηact are associated with overcom- 
ing the reaction energy barriers at the TPB or reactive surfaces (the 
so-called double charge layers). If the concentrations at the TPB are 
considered within the equilibrium expression, then the activation 
overpotential is known as a surface overpotential; i.e., directly in- 
ﬂuencing the reaction rate across the interface. The electrochemical 
kinetic equations used, e.g., the Butler-Volmer, Eq. (64) , establishes 
a relationship between the current density and the activation over- 
potential in each electrode. 

When  multiple  fuels  are  employed,  the  total  current  density 
in the fuel electrode is the result of the individual current den-

tion algorithm. This approach is to be considered a starting point, 
the actual situation is somewhat more complex as discussed in Bao 
et al . [99] .

The concentration overpotential stems from changes in the lo- 
cal concentrations at the reaction site from those assumed at the 
reference, either standard conditions or those in the channel. The 
concentration overpotential manifests itself through the concentra- 
tion dependences of both the kinetic equations Eq. (67) , and ther- 
modynamic losses, Eq. (21) . Mathematically, these losses are cal- 
culated using a mass or mole transport model, e.g., Eqs. (40) - (41) . 
Thus, one can evaluate the concentration overpotential by assum- 
ing no reactant transport losses within the electrodes (i.e., condi- 
tions are the same at the reaction site as in the channel). How- 
ever, this generates a somewhat arbitrary deﬁnition when mass- 
transport phenomena are modelled in detail, and thus, while use- 
ful for interpretation, should not be included in Eq. (99) . Typically, 
due  to  the  nature  of  the  coupling  of  mass  transport  and  kinet- 
ics and the equilibrium potential, the concentration overpotentials 
have signatures that are more exponential than linear with current 
density (see right-side Fig. 4 (a)).

For simple 0-D and 1-D models that do not explicitly account 
for detailed mass transport (e.g., along-the-ﬂow models), modiﬁed 
Nernst  equations  can  be  used  to  account  for  the  expected  con- 
centration overpotentials or simple linear transport always can be 
used as closure expressions [ 178 , 292 , 293 ]. At the electrode TPB, the 
partial pressure may be written as a simple algebraic function of 
i, TPB = 
the partial pressure in the gas channel and current density, p 
i, gc , i (cid:3)(cid:3) ) . The derivation involves writing the 1-D molar balance

and h is electrode thickness. The assumption of equimolar counter 
diffusion,  ˙ N

rect; a ﬂowing current always implies moles are being transferred 
at the electrodes. The methodology for the computation of concen- 
tration overpotentials described here is based on the simplest pos- 
sible of all the various analyses provided in section 2.3. The mo- 
j i (cid:3)(cid:3) / z F ,

In  a  3-D  fuel  cell  or  electrolyser,  where  ribs  are  employed, 
Fig. 12 shows that mass-transfer limitations will occur across-the- 
ﬂow at the electrode surface located near the ribs/lands. This phe- 
nomenon is shown in the papers by Geisler et al. [294] and Beale 
et  al.  [295] .  The  local  current  density  can  go  from  a  maximum 
to  a  very  small  value  over  a  short  distance,  as  local  starvation 
of  oxidant  or  fuel  occurs.  Under  the  circumstances,  the  validity 
of  employing  a  concentration  overpotential  in  2-D/3-D  is  called 
into question: One can always calculate a 2-D or 3-D concentra- 
tion overpotential, for display purposes as noted in Andersson et 
al. [62] . The concentration overpotentials are then a function of the 
ratio of the partial pressures of fuel species at the location of in- 
terest to that in the channel. This clearly depends on the choice of 
location in the channel. 

2.9.3. Ohmic overpotential 

The ohmic overpotential represents the resistance to getting the 
ions/electrons to/from the TPB sites, which is a loss of available 
free energy (SOFC) or that which must be overcome (SOEC). This 
can  be  accounted-for  by  simply  introducing  an  equivalent  resis- 
tance for ionic or electronic charge transfer which relates to the 
difference  in  the  ionic  or  electronic  potentials  in  the  Kirchhoff- 
Ohm, Eq. (6) , or Ohm’s law, Eqs. (59) - (60) . For example, the dif- 
ference in the ionic potential which for a single-ion conductor and 
typical  deﬁnitions  is  the  O 2 − electrochemical  potential  between 
the air electrode TPB and fuel electrode TPB. Similarly, the elec- 
tronic potential including possible contact resistances can be cal- 
culated. 

The  ohmic  overpotential, η

ohm ,  is  related  to  the  ohmic  resis- 
tance R 
ohm ( T ), that is composed of terms in the air and fuel elec- 
trodes, electrolyte, interconnects, and additional layers in the cell.

The ohmic losses are usually dominated by the electrolyte (but 
see section 2.8.4). Much smaller electronic losses occur in the in- 
terconnectors (at least for metallic components) and electrodes. It 
should be noted that the ohmic resistance is typically linear, but 
may  not  be  if  the  conductivity  changes,  locally.  Also,  it  is  tac- 
itly  assumed  in  calculating  an  ohmic  overpotential  that  the  lo- 
cal current density may be presumed to be locally 1-D through- 
out  the  electrode-electrolyte  assembly.  An  Arrhenius  equation  is 
usually suﬃcient to model these losses over a wide temperature 
range: 

ohm ( T ) =

Values  of  B 

ohm  and  E act  for  the  materials  used  in  the  Jülich 
ohm ∝ 
cell  [ 35 , 178 ]  are  given  in  Table  2 .  For  uniform  geometry  R 
1 /σ ,  and  the  reader  will  also  encounter  inverse  expressions  of 
the form, σ = ( B 
ohm /T ) exp ( −E act / R T ) , to be used in Eqs. (61) (62) . 
Other  expressions,  e.g.  power-series,  may  be  used  to  ﬁt  the  de- 
crease in R 

ohm with increasing temperature. 

While these overpotentials can be used in simpliﬁed cell and 
stack models, where computational speed is a priority, then less 
information is obtained about e.g., the activation overpotential dis- 
tribution as in the two potential models described in section 2.4. 
In the same manner the concentrations of the gas species are only 
indirectly described through the respective assumed concentration 
proﬁle through the thickness of the electrodes. The corresponding 
approach for achieving the resistance from the gas diffusion is sim- 
ply by describing the gas-transport by the respective PDE, see Sec- 
tion 2.3. 

The  approach  in  section  2.3  and  section  2.4  as  in  [136]  and 
the  one  described  in  this  section  with  serially  connected  resis- 
tances/overpotentials are thus two alternatives. Depending on the 
investigations, the different phenomena can be either described as 
a 0-D overpotential or through a PDE in section 2.3 and section 
2.4.

2.10. Code implementation 

There are many combinations of the above system of equations 
which  may  be  used  to  construct  mathematical  models  of  SOCs. 
Since one goal of the present article is that it be tutorial in nature, 
with an emphasis on explanation and guidance to the non-expert; 
two practical implementations are listed here as guidelines. 

Either:  (i)  The  Kirchhoff-Ohm  relation,  Eq.  (6) ,  and  the  Nernst 
equation, Eq. (17) , together with one or two suitable expressions 
for the activation terms, for instance Eq. (64) , constitute a system 
of coupled equations for E, i (cid:3)(cid:3) , ηact , 

f , ηact, a . 

or: (ii) The two half-Nernst equations, Eqs. (24) (25) are solved for 
f along with the Poisson system, Eqs. (59) and (60) , for the 
E a and E 
ionic and electronic potentials with Eq. (64) and i (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3) 
k for the 
ionic and electronic current densities per unit volume. 

k = ai (cid:3) (cid:3) 

In both (i) and (ii), the Nernst potential and activation overpo- 
tential are evaluated as a function of temperature, pressure, and 
composition. Sources/sinks of mass, heat, and momentum are com- 
puted, as described above. In both cases (i) and (ii) the following 
additional steps are taken 

(1) The continuity, Eq. (27) , momentum, Eq. (29) /(30), energy, 
Eq. (73) , and species equations, Eq. (35) are solved and used 
to compute pressures, temperatures, and concentrations, see 
Fig. 8 . 

(2) Bulk  properties  are  enumerated  at  current  temperature, 
pressure and concentration levels from which effective prop- 
erty values are enumerated. 

(3) The process is repeated until a satisfactory measure of con- 

vergence is obtained. 

The local resistance/conductivity is obtained from correlations 
of  the  form  Eq.  (101) .  Typical  values  of  parameters  such  as  the 
reaction  orders,  γ ,  the  pre-exponential  terms,  i pre 
0  ,  the  symme- 
try coeﬃcients, β, and the geometric factors, M , as well as B 
ohm 
and  E act ,  needed  for  the  Ohmic  losses  in  Eq.  (6) ,  Leonide  et  al. 
[ 35 , 178 ] are shown in Table 2 . The methods used to obtain these 
values are described, below, in section 3. For alternative geome- 
tries/components, the  user  must  carefully obtain values of  these 
and other parameters experimentally. 

In ref [124] , a mesh is deﬁned as a region upon which a par- 
ticular set of differential equations is solved. Fig. 13 illustrates the 
regions upon which the various transport equations are employed 
when the Kirchhoff-Ohm approach is adopted: The energy equa- 
tion  is  solved  on  the  entire  cell,  whereas  momentum  equations 
are solved only in ﬂuid regions, and electrochemistry in electrode 
and electrolyte regions. For a full two potential model, a different 
domain decomposition strategy would be employed with the elec- 
tronic potential being solved for in the electrodes and interconnec- 
tors and the ionic potential in the electrodes and electrolyte, see 
Zhang et al. [296] for details. 

Fig. 11 shows sample calculations from the former implementa- 
tion, based on Eqs. (6) , (17) , and (64) , with hydrogen as fuel and 
dry air as oxidant for a 1-cell insulated stack, for a Jülich Mark 
F  design,  Fig.  3 ,  as  described  in  the  paper  by  Beale  et  al.  [124] . 
Fig. 11 (a) shows air-side pressure, whereas Fig. 11 (b) displays tem- 
perature.  It  can  be  seen,  for  counter  ﬂow,  the  temperature  is  a 
maximum in the central region of the cell and that the tempera- 
ture gradient is signiﬁcant, a matter for concern in SOC design due 
to stresses along the periphery of the cell and at the glass-metal 
seals. Fig. 11 (c) exhibits air-side streamlines coloured by velocity 
magnitude. The ﬂow is generally uniform other than in the man- 
ifold regions. Fig. 11 (d) shows hydrogen mass fraction which does 
not decrease at the sides of the cell due to there being an electro- 
chemically inactive region there. Fig. 11 (e)(f) show the local current 
density and Nernst potential in the electrochemically active region 

of the cell. A comparison of the results of methods (i) and (ii) for 
a high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell may be found in 
the recent paper by Zhang et al. [296] 

The results of Fig. 11 were obtained by coding original source 
code  within  an  existing  open  source  library  OpenFOAM  [297] , 
which  employs  equation  mimicking.  The  advantages  of  employ- 
ing open source codes are: (a) The user has complete control of 
the model equations employed. (b) He/she does not have to write 
the CFD solvers, they already exist. (c) The models may be shared 
freely with others, who do not have to pay expensive license fees. 
(d)  Similarly,  high  performance  computers  employing  numerous 
ranks  may  be  deployed.  Both  open  source  and  commercial  soft- 
ware may also be linked [298] to chemistry software such as Can- 
tera [ 65 , 66 ] should a higher order kinetic scheme be considered 
necessary. 

2.11. Stack and multiscale modelling 

Solid oxide cells are generally operated in stacks, and the per- 
formance will vary from cell-to-cell. While it is theoretically pos- 
sible  to  solve  the  systems  of  equations  described  above;  a  very 
large number of computational cells will be required to tessellate 
the region occupied by a stack, including manifolds [ 299 , 300 ]. The 
solution of Beale and Zhubrin [76] is a volume-averaging or ‘ho- 
mogenising’ technique. This means that the details of the individ- 
ual  parts,  Fig.  3 ,  are  lost.  Rate  equations  are  substituted  for  the 
prescription of drag and heat transfer. Within the ‘core’ of the stack 
(channels, electrodes and electrolyte, interconnects) the energy and 
momentum equations in the form of Eqs. (81) and (30) are solved, 
with: 

F = 

2 f μRe 
εD 2 
h 

V U v = AU 

(102) 

(103) 

in place of Eqs. (31) and (80) . In Eqs. (102) and (103) f is a fric- 
tion coeﬃcient and U v is a volumetric heat transfer coeﬃcient ob- 
tained from U, as given by Eq. (81) thereby eliminating cross-wise 
diffusion  terms  in  the  channels.  Values  of  f  and  U  may  be  ob- 
tained  by  physical  experiment,  analytical  and/or  numerical  solu- 
tions e.g., of Sturm Liouville differential equations, or by conduct- 
ing detailed CFD calculations in a repeating unit. Stream-wise dif- 
fusion is still permitted, so low Reynolds/Péclet ﬂows are properly 
considered.  In  the  manifolds,  the  standard  momentum,  Eq.  (29) , 
and energy, Eq. (73) , equations are solved, in detail. With the ad- 
dition of mass transfer, Eq. (40) , the Kirchhoff-Ohm relationship, 
Eq.  (6) ,  and  Nernst  equation,  Eq.  (17) ,  a  stack  model  is  created. 
Volume-averaged results were compared to a detailed simulation 
with near-identical results, with a signiﬁcant (100 ×) increase in 
computational speed, and decrease in required memory. Nishida et 
al. [301] developed and applied the method [89] to a Jülich Mark-F 
18-cell stack for which experimental data had been gathered [302] . 
Stack modelling in fuel cells is the subject in the recent article by 
Beale et al. [303] . 

Further developments in stack modelling include the work of 
Molla et al. and Navasa et al. [ 304 , 305 ] who modiﬁed the charge 
transport equation so the computational volumes are able to con- 
tain multiple SOC cells. Mechanical stresses/strains are also con- 
sidered. Steady state simulations of a full stack in 3-D can be sim- 
ulated in the range of minutes (10-15 minutes) on a workstation 
[16] . The geometry in this type of homogenised model is indirectly 
included through effective material parameters such as the over- 
all resistance, Eq. (102) and volumetric heat transfer coeﬃcient in 
Eq. (103) for the stack. The submodel of a repeating unit can also 
be used to obtain local parameters, such as overpotentials, or stress

concentrations  [16] .  The  homogenised  stack  model  and  the  sub- 
model of the repeating unit constitute a multi-scale model, which 
can be run with limited computational resources, e.g., on high-end 
computer workstations, obviating the need for supercomputers. 

Computational capacity is continuously increasing and with this 
the opportunity for running more extensive simulations, such as 
full stack models based on the single-cell formulations described 
in  this  paper.  However,  except  for  a  very  few  published  works 
[ 299 , 306 ] this has not been utilised to-date in the SOC modelling 
community. 

While  massively  parallel  computational  resources  could  help 
push  the  boundaries  for  what  is  possible  in  computational  en- 
gineering  of  electrochemical  cells;  SOC  technology  also  requires 
practical modelling tools to develop prototypes of new stack de- 
signs  and  predict  long-term  performance,  realistically.  For  this, 
multiscale modelling approaches based on employing the results 
of ﬁne-scale calculations within a coarse-scale approach are acces- 
sible. Such models can readily be run on high-end computer work- 
stations and are both reliable and eﬃcient. 

It is recommended that in the future, not only should effort s 
be  taken  towards  harnessing  the  resources  of  high-performance 
super-computers to obtain detailed numerical solutions, but also in 
the meantime, computationally eﬃcient multiscale models should 
be further developed and further reﬁned. 

2.12. Degradation and durability modelling 

Understanding  and  controlling  SOC  degradation  mechanisms 
are among the greatest challenges for the maturation of the tech- 
nology.  Degradation  is  the  comprehensive  term  used  for  perfor- 
mance deterioration over time due to intrinsic property variations 

(conductivities etc.), microstructural changes (TPB lengths, poros- 
ity etc.), poisoning effects, and macroscopic failures, for example 
delamination, contact loss, electrolyte cracking, that are the result 
of operation. These are diﬃcult to predict deterministically, even if 
speciﬁc external phenomena, such as chromium/sulphur poisoning, 
carbon deposition, gas formation and pressurization, can be identi- 
ﬁed as causes of degradation. Mechanistic correlations are diﬃcult 
in the cases of microstructural, contacting, and catalytic wear of 
active components resulting from seemingly safe operation. 

Different  research  groups  have  looked  into  modelling  the 
various  degradation  processes  occurring  in  SOCs.  These  include 
chromium-poisoning of the air electrode, corrosion scale forming 
on the air side of the interconnect, nickel agglomeration and nickel 
migration. Whereas some works focus on characterising and mod- 
elling one phenomenon at a time, e.g., corrosion [307] , chromium 
poisoning [ 308 , 309 ], and Ni-agglomeration [310] ; others attempt to 
integrate all of them in a single 1-D or 2-D model [311-317] . Simu- 
lating transient degradation in 3-D for a full stack has not yet been 
accomplished. 

The  interrelation  of  all  processes  taking  place  in  SOCs  at  all 
scales would render any numerical extrapolation of these depen- 
dences, over the long term, completely unfeasible in terms of cal- 
culation  resources.  Simpliﬁed  modelling  approaches  need  to  be 
employed, compatible with useful lifetime predictions. This relies 
on statistical methodologies for mapping and correlation of param- 
eters (among others Bayesian inference, the method of moments 
and maximum likelihood estimation procedures), and on the de- 
velopment of approximation models which mimic the behaviour 
of a deterministic model. The input-output behaviour is solely im- 
portant. In the case of stochastic degradation mechanisms, these 
can be modelled by certain random mathematical processes, such 

32 

S.B. Beale, M. Andersson, C. Boigues-Muñoz et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100902 

as the Gaussian process, random walk, (non-homogeneous) Poisson 
point processes, or gamma processes. 

in the stack as a function of degradation processes must be cor- 
rectly described. 

It follows that the model must rely on data generated by the 
tested system, to capture signiﬁcant behavioural correlations over 
the complete operational space. The surrogate model can only em- 
ulate those parts of the SOC that are conﬁned by the location of 
experimental measurement. This means the inﬂuence of any pe- 
ripherals inside the cell (such as cell frames, or stack manifolds, 
or similar) must  be carefully considered. If properly carried out, 
this approach provides a way, not only to predict the global be- 
haviour of the system, but also to provide validation of complex, 
deterministic models. The approach is very sensitive to the quality 
and quantity of initial experimental data. 

Yan  et  al .  [318]  developed  a  2-D  dynamic  model  for  heat 
and mass transfer coupled with electron and ion transport equa- 
tions, adopting a simpliﬁed approach based on ordinary differen- 
tial equations to model catalyst activity and anodic porosity time 
evolution. The dependence of the variables on operating conditions 
was accounted-for through synthetic parameters extracted by the 
model. Regarding the estimation of SOFC cell/stack remaining use- 
ful life (RUL); Wu and Ye [319] proposed an algorithm combining 
diagnostic and prognostic functionalities. Voltage is used as a per- 
formance reference to estimate RUL under fuel-electrode poison- 
ing and air-electrode humidiﬁcation. The combination of a least- 
squares support vector machine, supervised-learning methods, and 
hidden  semi-Markov  models  allows  estimation  of  RUL  within  a 
±20% error margin. 

Some useful approaches to predict RUL, in operando , can be de- 
rived from statistical literature focusing on reliability assessment, 
though this is rarely adopted. In Guida et al . [320] , a Bayesian es- 
timation procedure for a degradation process modelled as a non- 
homogeneous gamma process is proposed, and the RUL probability 
density functions computed eﬃciently. The approach in Guida et 
al . [321] correlated degradation mechanisms, affected variables and 
operating conditions in a fault-tree analysis to enhance the results 
of statistical analysis highlighting which variable is predominant. It 
provides a reference computational framework yielding a better in- 
terpretation of the root-cause analysis of the occurring degradation 
phenomena. 

Although  some  chemical  degradation  processes  (Ni  oxidation, 
carbon deposition, sulfur poisoning) can be included in continuum- 
scale models, see [322-324] , the degradation of the SOC cells are, 
in many cases, at a scale smaller than continuum mechanical mod- 
els can handle. Effects like poisoning of reactive sites, taking place 
on  a  molecular/atomic  level,  will  impact  macroscale  parameters 
such as polarisation resistance or exchange current density in the 
model. The same holds for degradation phenomena occurring on 
the micro-scale such as Ni agglomeration, Ni migration, corrosion, 
propagation of cracks etc. These can be addressed by phase ﬁeld 
modelling approaches. In this type of model, the numerical codes 
(CFD, FEM) are overlaid with an energy criterion and rate equa- 
tions for changes to the microstructure. There have been a few at- 
tempts to simulate microstructural changes and the resulting per- 
formance  loss  by  phase-ﬁeld  approaches  [325-327] .  In  ref  [328] , 
the authors studied the agglomeration and migration of Ni in an 
SOEC. This can thus be used to describe the evolution of the mi- 
crostructure and the impact on the performance of the solid oxide 
cells and adjoining materials. 

In some cases, it is possible to represent the degradation phe- 
nomena going on at a lower scale (than modelled) by employing a 
2 electrol- 
number of simpliﬁcations, e.g., carbon deposition in CO 
ysis [135] , or corrosion of a metallic supported SOFC [276] . How- 
ever although multi-scale modelling approaches including degrada- 
tion, are currently under development, these must become a clear 
objective for the SOC modelling research community: In order to 
truly predict the lifetime of SOC products, performance variations 

3. Experimental appraisal of modelling parameters 

3.1. Input parameters and calibration 

The  modelling  equations  for  a  SOC  include  a  number  of  pa- 
rameters which require prescription. Usually geometric parameters 
are readily available. The same holds for some intrinsic material 
properties, which are available in established reference and table 
books, as empirical correlations and online data bases [329] . Ac- 
curate values of transport parameters such as conductivities and 
diffusion  coeﬃcients  are  critical,  and  have  a  signiﬁcant  impact 
on the results. An example is the interdiffusion of nickel into an 
8YSZ-electrolyte,  which  affects  conductivity  [ 330 , 331 ]  over  time. 
For nominally identical materials, published values of intrinsic ma- 
terial property parameters can vary by one to two orders of mag- 
nitude [ 332 , 333 ]. The same holds for electrochemical parameters 
such  as  surface  exchange  coeﬃcients  of  MIEC-air  electrode  ma- 
terials  [334]  and  line  speciﬁc  resistance  at  the  nickel/YSZ/pore 
TPB [335] , which may be affected by segregated impurities [336- 
338] . Furthermore, ageing phenomena [339] alter material proper- 
ties over time [ 340 , 341 ] and therefore inﬂuence published values. 
The choice of model parameters and/or the lack of knowledge of 
their behaviour over time presents a major problem in assessing 
the ﬁdelity of SOC modelling results. Furthermore, the bulk ma- 
terial properties have to be transformed into effective parameters 
considering microstructural features as volume fraction, tortuosity, 
volume speciﬁc surface/interface area, TPB length, etc., which may 
not be known. Such effective parameters are required in all cell 
and stack models employing volume-averaging, or ‘homogenised’, 
techniques. 

Often, certain material parameters, for example the ionic resis- 
tivity of the electrolyte substrate or e.g., the internal resistance of 
the cell dominate. Therefore, values which properly reﬂect the sys- 
tem under investigation have to be selected from the literature, or 
better, measured in-house. In cell models, the parameter may be 
varied within the range of published values and this presented as 
a result interval [ 342 , 343 ]. Parameters of little signiﬁcance can be 
ﬁxed. The relevant parameters should either be measured directly, 
or, if this is impossible, a ﬁtting procedure should be applied to 
adjust the simulation result to measured values, hopefully by si- 
multaneously ﬁtting various sets of data under different conditions. 
Such a sensitivity analysis may not always be practical, in view of 
the number of parameters. 

The  ASR  can  be  determined  from  a  polarisation  curve  of  a 
small-scale (1 cm ²) cell operated at homogeneous conditions [239] , 
so there should not be any gradients of temperature, gas composi- 
tion, or current density over the active cell area. The contact resis- 
tance between cell and interconnect can be included by contact- 
ing the single cell with interconnects or by measuring an ideally 
contacted cell and the contact resistance in a separate experiment. 
A  technique  to  increase  the  measurement  sensitivity  of  intrin- 
sic electrode catalytic properties, especially related to TPB length 
such as charge transfer and overpotential, is the use of patterned 
ﬁlm electrodes of the material to be examined, where length-to- 
surface  (and length-to-volume) ratio  of  the  electrode  material is 
maximised, in order to minimise bulk factors which are diﬃcult 
to control experimentally, including the geometry, microstructure, 
and transport properties of the electrode as well as its physical and 
chemical  compatibility  with  the  electrolyte.  The  patterned  elec- 
trode  functions  as  the  working  electrode  deposited  on  a  regular 
cell  substrate  and  can  provide  insights  in  tailored  structuring  of 
electrode materials as well as yield values for intrinsic parameters 
[344-347] . The measurements have to be performed in the relevant

range of stack operating conditions, providing measured values as 
a function of temperature, fuel and oxidant composition, and cur- 
rent density. 

For more detailed modelling, impedance spectroscopy is the re- 
liable  method  to  deconvolute  the  different  mechanisms.  Leonide 
et al. [126] applied impedance spectroscopy and the distribution 
of relaxation times [ 33 , 34 ] to set up and parameterise an equiv- 
alent  circuit  model  for  a  SOC.  A  non-linear  0-D  DC  polarisa- 
tion model coupling oxygen reduction, hydrogen electro-oxidation, 
gas diffusion, and ohmic losses was derived to simulate current- 
voltage characteristics [178] under different circumstances, based 
on  Butler-Volmer  and  Fick ´s  law  with  excellent  agreement  with 
measured data [22] . In the case of high performance SOCs, decon- 
volution is only possible if (i) the cell is operated homogeneously 
without any lateral gradients and (ii) an appropriate series of spec- 
tra highlighting the considered loss mechanism are measured. The 
testing conditions should not be ﬁxed to a narrow, system-relevant 
testing parameter ﬁeld but to exaggerate and thereby identify and 
enable the deconvolution of the different loss mechanisms in the 
cell. There are different approaches to access required parameters 
such as testing at much lower temperatures to access, for example, 
bulk and grain boundary conductivity of the electrolyte [348-351] , 
and above nominal operating temperature to reduce the impact of 
thermally activated loss processes. Furthermore, gas mixtures can 
be  selected  that  uncover  loss  mechanisms,  such  as  air  electrode 
electrochemistry [352] or gas diffusion [239] . 

The data presented in Table 2 include electrochemical param- 
eters  of  electrodes  and  cells  [ 35 , 36 , 353 ],  microstructural  param- 
eters  of  porous  electrode  structures  [ 240 , 354 ],  and  material  in- 
terface parameters evaluated on model samples such as bulk ce- 
ramics and patterned electrodes. To model large area cells in 3-D, 
the coupling of gas phase transport, electrochemical reactions and 
ionic as well as electronic conduction in a porous, multiphase elec- 
trode has to be simpliﬁed. There are a number of electrochemical 
models [ 342 , 355-361 ] predicting the polarisation diagram of SOCs. 
These  models  commonly  consider  physical  backgrounds,  such  as 
the Butler-Volmer equation, Eq. (64) , and Fick’s law, Eq. (38) , but 
the equations are often simpliﬁed. The Butler-Volmer equation may 
be replaced by an ASR, linear function Eq. (66) , or a Tafel equa- 
tion Eq. (65) [ 359 , 360 ]. The partial pressure-dependencies of the 
exchange  current  densities  are  often  simpliﬁed/neglected,  i.e.,  γ
=  1  in  Eq.  (67)  [ 342 , 357 , 362 ],  or  a  constant  value  is  used  for 
the exchange current density, i (cid:3) (cid:3) 
0 [ 356 , 360 ]. Frequently parameters 
are used that are either generally estimated, or taken from liter- 
ature [ 253 , 363 , 364 ]. Leonide et al . [178] present a 0-D cell model 
for fuel electrode supported SOFCs, fully parameterised by means 
of impedance spectroscopy and an appropriate equivalent circuit 
model,  Fickian  gas  diffusion  in  the  electrodes,  Butler-Volmer  ki- 
netics, with the ohmic resistance in the electrolyte being predom- 
inant.  A  similar  approach  and  data  values  may  readily  be  em- 
ployed in 3-D models [ 124 , 365 ]. In [ 35 , 353 ], methods to deduce 
the model parameters from a series of impedance measurements 
with appropriate operating parameter variations are discussed and 
appropriate model equations are given. The concept is represented, 
schematically, in Fig. 6 (b). 

To model the current voltage behaviour, the voltage losses in 
the substrate, electrodes, and electrolyte are subtracted from the 
open  circuit  voltage  as  detailed  in  Eqs.  (99)  and  (6) .  A  number 
of parameters are required. These may be obtained by means of 
impedance spectroscopy measurements on single cells. Details on 
the procedure are to be found in [ 36 , 126 , 353 ]. Measurements are 
performed on small scale cells without any gradients in tempera- 
ture, gas composition or current density. 
The effective diffusion coeﬃcient D eff 
k 

k of gas species k 
is given by Eq. (87) where the parameter M is notionally written 
according to Eq. (89) and the structural parameters of the fuel elec- 

= M · D 

trode and air electrode can either be evaluated from impedance 
spectra [126] or calculated using the microstructural parameters, 
porosity, ε, and tortuosity, τ . The applicability of the model has 
been presented in a number of papers. Klotz applied the underly- 
ing equivalent circuit model to simulate the impedance of a stack 
in  a  1-D  approach  [366] .  In  [22] ,  Njodzefon  proved  the  applica- 
bility of the model in electrolyser mode. Furthermore, the model 
can be integrated in FEM and FVM codes that analyse the impact 
of  the  ﬂow  ﬁeld  geometry  [ 127 , 367 ]  and  predict  local  gas  com- 
position and electrochemical performance of hydrocarbon fuelled 
stacks [ 368 , 369 ]. In such approaches, the diffusive and convective 
gas transport in the fuel electrode substrate and the air electrode 
are modelled considering the cell and stack geometry. In volume- 
averaged or homogenised models, gas transport and catalysis are 
treated in a spatially resolved way, considering porosity, tortuosity 
and active catalyst surface evaluated by means of tomography. 

3.1.1. Validation 

A model without validation is of little use. The most common 
measure, by far, is the polarisation curve (section 1.2.1, Fig. 4 ). This 
is clearly inadequate. The development of a proper set of indepen- 
dent procedures, both to validate and to reliably calibrate models, 
is a long-term goal of the current authors, among others. It is part 
of an ongoing mandate of the IEA Advanced Fuel Cells Technology 
Collaboration Programme Modelling Annex, Annex 37, of which all 
of the present authors are members. The challenges are signiﬁcant; 
SOCs are tested under extreme operating conditions, typically at 
elevated temperatures, often with far-from-ideal boundary condi- 
tions. Validation of the results of complex cell and stack models 
is an extremely important task. Most CFD models, when based on 
a  reasonable equation  set,  will generate  results  that  are  qualita- 
tively correct, and of great utility to the end user who is thus able 
to ‘look into’ the design. The step to quantitively correct results is 
fraught with diﬃculties. A model validation with published experi- 
mental data is mostly insuﬃcient as the number of measured pub- 
lished parameters for SOCs is limited. In many cases, just the cell 
or stack performance data and some information about cell/stack 
design and operating parameters is available. Internal values such 
as  local  temperature  distribution  or  local  gas  compositions  are 
often  missing.  The  1996  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  SOFC 
benchmark [23] , with hydrogen (benchmark #1) methane (bench- 
mark #2) as a fuel has been reproduced by a number of workers 
[ 24 , 370-373 ]. It is not, however, a piece of real hardware/operating 
conditions, but rather a set of idealised model parameters and ge- 
ometry. It is also very old. While there is no reason not to com- 
pare numerical models with other numerical models, more modern 
benchmarks, based on physical hardware are required. The provi- 
sion of open source data bases of reliable experimental data would 
then allow for round robin comparisons of the results of numeri- 
cal procedures to be made. Such benchmarks must be ‘neutral’ in 
nature and not steered towards any given methodology/code. 

First  and  foremost,  it  is  necessary,  to  separate  out  validation 
data from calibration data. For instance, an ASR approach, where 
the resistance, R , is obtained from the i (cid:3)(cid:3) -V characteristic is very 
likely to show good agreement with experiments under similar op- 
erating conditions. In many cases the measured polarisation curves 
are approximately straight lines. Validation of a model by means 
of the polarisation curves should therefore include, as a minimum, 
varying the operating temperature, see Eq. (101) , and also if possi- 
2 ) gas composition, and utilisations 
ble the fuel (%H 
(via the gas velocities), Eq. (1) , over a reasonably wide range. In 
other words, one has to take care that the tests are performed over 
a wide range of operating parameters. Similar issues occur, for ex- 
ample, when activation parameters such as i (cid:3) (cid:3) 
0 in Eq. (64) are eval- 
uated from the polarisation curves in the lim i → 0.

ing cell calculations. Regarding (ii), temperature measurements are 
typically obtained inside SOCs by inserting thermocouples near the 
surface boundaries rather than in the centre of the cell, a situa- 
tion which is little better than the situation (i) for current density. 
A deﬁciency for model validation is cell degradation, discussed in 
section 2.12; until degradation issues are addressed/resolved, mod- 
elling is limited in its range of application to performance under 
idealised  conditions.  While  it  is  diﬃcult  to  propose  a  ‘standard 
procedure’ for SOC model validation at this time, such an exercise 
(or exercises) would be of great utility, and would allow for round 
robin tests, of both computer codes and of experimental facilities, 
to be conducted. 

If possible, operating parameters affecting a single loss mech- 
anism  should  be  selected,  for  example:  high  fuel  utilisation  en- 
hancing gas conversion/depletion, diluted gases enhancing gas dif- 
fusion, lowered temperatures enhancing thermally activated losses 
etc. Then, one has to consider model stability limits [295] as well 
as inhomogeneities [375] . An uneven fuel distribution between the 
layers in a stack in combination with a high (average) fuel utilisa- 
tion might even re-oxidise an undersupplied layer and thus change 
its properties irreversibly. 

It is of great value if internal parameters of the cell/stack are 
accessible  for  model  validation.  In  the  case  of  stack  testing,  the 
most commonly measured values are the individual cell voltages. 
There have been some attempts to acquire in plane localised val- 
ues,  such  as  measuring  the  temperature  distribution  in  a  stack 
[376] , the local fuel composition and temperature in a cell [54] or 
the current density distribution in segmented cells [ 374 , 377 ]. Dif- 
ferent loss contributions in a SRU are accessible by means of a lo- 
cal potential measurement using potential probes [239] . Continu- 
ous advances are being brought about in test rig adaptation. Even 
different loss contributions in a SRU are accessible by means of a 
local potential measurement using potential probes [239] . 

Any  numerical  study  should  present  results  showing  compu- 
tational grid/mesh independence and convergence criteria within 
some  minimum  residual  bound.  Numerical  convergence  may  be 
considered to have been achieved when the utilisation computed 
by Eqs. (1) and (3) yield identical values, to within a margin-of- 
error. Typically, overall values of current density, temperature, and 
species mass/mole fraction will change marginally as the mesh is 
reﬁned.  However,  local  extrema  will  change,  and  these  are  im- 
portant, see for example Fig. 12 . Therefore rather than recording 
the  usual  local  spot  values  of  variables, such  as  current  density, 
mole fraction etc., as a function of mesh size, rather deﬁning a φ- 
distribution by,

where f ( φ) represents the frequency of values located in the inter-

k , as the computational 
(mean, variance, skewness, etc.) of f 
mesh is reﬁned, is indicative that mesh independent results have 
been attained. Modern post-pressing software can readily integrate 
a ﬁeld of results, and generate the frequency distribution deﬁned 
in Eq. (104) through a surface or volume region.

3.1.2. Veriﬁcation 

Analytical solutions for electrochemical processes are few and 
far between. A notable exception is to found in the book by Ku- 
likovsky [133] . Analytical solutions may be adopted for code ver- 
iﬁcation, as opposed to validation for which physical data are re- 
quired. The 1-D solution of Kulikovsky et al. [378] was originally 
developed for an idealised polymer electrolyte fuel cell, however it 
may also be applied to an idealised SOC where it assumed that the 
fuel electrode is suﬃciently fast that it may be neglected and in 
addition the cathodic overpotential may be taken constant. Mass

Fig. 14 shows a comparison between experimental and numer- 
ical results in terms of a polarisation curve at various operating 
temperatures. The authors also compared results for a variety of 
oxygen and hydrogen inlet concentrations. If possible, different ge- 
ometries (size, ﬂow conﬁguration, active area, etc.) should also be 
considered and compared. Fig. 15 shows a comparison between ex- 
perimentally and numerically obtained results gas composition in 
terms of mole fractions of a model reformate. 

Many diﬃculties associated with SOC validation are, in fact, ex- 
perimental  quality-control  issues.  Normally  only  a  single  Nernst 
potential,  corresponding  to  open  circuit,  with  no  internal  heat 
sources/sinks,  is  measured.  Conversely,  solutions  of  Eq.  (17)  and 
(24) , (25) admit to 2-D and 3-D ﬁelds of values, which are eval- 
uated under ﬁnite current densities, see Fig. 11 . Physical experi- 
ments typically employ a digital controller which ramps up and 
down through a program of values of current density or cell volt- 
age, and possibly (though not always) adjusting the ﬂow rates be- 
yond a certain minimum current density threshold, to obtain pre- 
deﬁned values of fuel and air utilisation: For this reason, a min- 
imum dwell-time at any given operating point is needed, and in 
addition, the cell temperatures also change, due to the variation in 
heat sources/sinks with current density, see Eq. (26) . In view of the 
large amount of data required for a polarisation curve; experimen- 
tal results are seldom gathered under true steady-state conditions, 
which may under circumstances lead to damage to the specimen 
due to overheating. The requirement for the mathematical model 
to replicate transient conditions corresponding to an actual con- 
troller cycle might seem excessive, but may ultimately be neces- 
sary. Cell and stack tests are frequently conducted with cells irradi- 
ated with thermal radiation laterally in a furnace, and sitting under 
compression from above on a solid base, such as an uninsulated 
ﬂoor. Such complex thermal boundary conditions are almost im- 
possible to replicate in numerical implementations, and they will 
affect the results. Ideally tests would be conducted under adiabatic 
(well-insulated) wall boundary conditions, and ﬂow Reynolds num- 
bers suﬃciently high that heat metering is of high accuracy. 

Two quantities of great utility for model validation are (i) local 
values of current density, obtained using a current scan shunt and 
(ii) a ﬁeld of local temperatures. The former (i) would appear to 
be extremely diﬃcult to obtain with the present technology, due 
to the high operating temperatures of SOCs, a notable exception 
being  the  work  of  Bessler  at  al.  [374] .  The  resolution  of  current 
scan  shunts  is  presently  far  coarser  than  the  meshes  associated 
with numerical simulations. Moreover it is the ﬁne details of the 
electrochemical conversion process that are desired when perform-

transfer is presumed to be a passive process, so mass ﬂux at the 
electrode leads to no changes in mixture density, ρ and velocity, 
u is constant. This implies no overall continuity change, which is 
clearly not true in the air electrode of a SOFC except for very small 
utilisation, εu → 0. Furthermore, mixing is presumed to be ‘perfect’.

where f ( η) is the air electrode activation overpotential, which is

assumed that γ = γO

3.2. Microstructure 

3.2.1. Measurements of porosity 

The  open  porosity  of  an  electrode  can  be  measured  using 
porosimetry methods [ 379 ] or approximated through microscope 
image  analysis.  When  analysing  the  fuel  electrode  of  an  SOC,  it 
needs to be in its reduced (operating) state, hence the sample, usu- 
ally delivered in its oxidised state needs to be reduced under nom- 
inal conditions, and subsequently cooled down to ambient condi- 
tions with a controlled temperature ramp (e.g., 2 °C/min). The cell 
can then be broken into samples by mechanical means and these 
can be used for porosity analysis. To assess the porosity of the fuel 

electrode by means of Archimedean porosimetry, the air electrode 
and the electrolyte need to be polished and the resulting sample 
needs to be cleaned with distilled water and kept in a dry oven 
overnight at 120 °C. The sample can then be cooled down in dry air 
to room temperature and then weighed. Following this, the sample 
needs to be put in a beaker with distilled water, and heated up to 
100 °C to displace air from the pores. After cooling to room tem- 
perature, the sample has to be weighed submerged in distilled wa- 
ter at 25 °C. A ﬁnal measurement is made by drying the outermost 
part of the sample leaving its structure completely saturated with 
water. The porosity is obtained as ε = ( m sat − m 
dry ) / ( m sat − m wet ) , 
where m sat  is the weight of the sample after drying its external 
surface, m 
dry  is the weight under dry conditions and m wet  is the 
weight when completely immersed in distilled water. 

3.3. Electrochemistry 

3.3.1. Reaction order 

One  way  to  evaluate  the  reaction  order(s),  γ ,  is  to  use  data 
from EIS and equivalent circuit modelling as explained by Leonide 
[353] . Following Boigues-Muñoz et al. [380] , a ﬁrst-order approxi- 
mation of the Butler-Volmer equation, Eq. (64) , can be made with 
negligible error in the case of very small overpotentials, near the 
open circuit voltage. Such an approximation produces a linear re- 
lationship  between  the  activation  overpotential  and  the  current 
(cid:3)(cid:3) 
density, namely: ηact ≈ R T i (cid:3)(cid:3) / z F i 0 
. It should be noted that the lo- 
cal exchange transfer current density is dependent on the current 
density generated (SOFC) or consumed (SOEC) through the mole 
fraction of the reactants and products, hence theoretically the gas- 
diffusion equation should also be solved. However, because the cal- 
culations are made at low current densities, the concentrations can 
be assumed to be those of the bulk gas. The resistance associated 
with the activation overpotential can then be expressed in the fol- 
lowing terms: 
(cid:14)
(cid:14)
d ηact 
(cid:14)
(cid:14)
di (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i (cid:3)(cid:3) → 0 

= r act =  R T 
z F i (cid:3)(cid:3) 
0 

(108) 

By  substituting  the  appropriate  exchange  current  density  ex- 
pression, for instance Eq. (67) into Eq. (108) and applying common 
logarithms to both sides of the equation, the following expression 
for the fuel electrode is obtained: 
⎛

−γH 2 O · log ( x H 2 O ) − γH · log ( x H 2 ) 

(109) 

Eq.  (109)  correlates  the  activation  resistance  to  the  reactant 
mole fractions. This has the form of a straight line on a log-log

overpotential  function.  As  the  forward  reaction  symmetry  factor, 
β
f , is the only unknown in Eq. (64) , it can be easily obtained by 
iteration methods. At low current densities, local exchange transfer 
current densities can be considered to be constant, hence ﬁtting 
with the Butler-Volmer equation in this region will yield a more 
precise value of forward reaction symmetry factor. 

3.3.4. Charge transport 

The resistance associated with ion or electron transport can be 
measured either ex-situ or in-situ and is typically accomplished us- 
ing EIS with an AC perturbation so that concentration gradients do 
not develop [381] . For multiple components, one can use the high- 
frequency  resistance  or  intercept  of  the  impedance  spectra  with 
the real axis on a Nyquist plot. This value results in a shorting of 
the cell, so all contact resistances and those associated with the 
dominant conductive pathways will be measured. To delineate be- 
tween different components or interfaces, one can assemble dif- 
ferent types of conﬁgurations, e.g., by removing the separator or 
changing the material thickness and measuring the overall resis- 
tance. While this technique is powerful, as it can interrogate the 
system under different operating conditions, it cannot distinguish 
the separate contributions when mixed electronic/ionic conductors 
are present in the same layer (e.g., electrodes) since the least re- 
sistance  pathway  will  be  measured.  To  determine  the  ionic  and 
electronic resistance in those parts, more complicated impedance 
analysis such as sheet-resistance techniques are required. 

3.4. Degradation measurements 

In most SOC modelling approaches, the model represents the 
cell or stack at a ﬁxed state. Usually, all electrochemical measure- 
ments  for  model  parameterisation  and  validation  are  performed 
within a short period of time after commissioning. The same holds 
for material parameters evaluated by means of samples, i.e., bulk 
conductivities, porosities, etc. Thus, the model will represent the 
initial  performance  of  the  stack.  This  performance  deteriorates 
with operation, due to degradation of cell materials, morphology, 
and chemical composition. Some approaches to degradation phe- 
nomena in SOC-models were described in section 2.12, the most 
advanced approach of which is a complex model that considers ag- 
ing of the different electrochemical and catalytic reactions as well 
as diffusive and migrative transport mechanisms. 

In any case, it is required to parameterise the degradation pro- 
cesses included in the model. In the case of space-resolved cell or 
stack models, one has to consider gradients in temperature, fuel 
and oxidant  composition, and current  density.  As  most degrada- 
tion processes are affected by those parameters, the degradation 
is nonhomogeneous and has to be treated in a spatially resolved 
manner also. Thus, it is necessary to obtain information about indi- 
vidual degradation processes of air electrode, electrolyte, fuel elec- 
trode, contact layers, coatings, interconnects, etc., and their depen- 
dences on operating parameters. The intrinsic degradation of ionic 
and electronic conductivities as well as contact resistances can be 
measured on model samples under relevant temperature and gas 
composition ranges. If the conductivity decrease is caused by an 
interdiffused species, either from a neighbouring layer, or from im- 
purities  in  the  supplied  gases,  the  measurement  has  to  be  per- 
formed under realistic conditions, i.e., in a small sized cell or re- 
peat unit. Endler et al. [ 352 , 382 ] deconvoluted the different degra-

impedance spectroscopy and the distribution of relaxation times. 
A similar approach was applied to study chromium [ 383 , 384 ] and 
sulphur  poisoning  [ 385 , 386 ].  Ploner  [387]  studied  the  impact  of 
operating parameters on the degradation of anode supported cells 
with a special emphasis on the aging of the Ni/YSZ cermet fuel

can be deduced from an equivalent circuit after deconvolution of 
EIS spectra and characterisation of relaxation times for each pro- 
cess, as described in section 1.2.2. By carrying out EIS in OCV under 
different com positions of H

charge transfer resistance, the values can be plotted in a log-log 
graph, Fig. 16 and from the gradient of the linear relationship, the 
reaction orders are obtained.

3.3.3. Forward reaction symmetry factor 

The resistances associated with the charge transfer mechanisms 
in SOC electrodes are inherently correlated with the current be- 
ing generated (SOFC) or consumed (SOEC) by means of the Butler- 
Volmer equation or equivalent. The methodology presented in this 
work is based on a two-stage data ﬁtting approach. The ﬁrst step 
relies on the use of an equivalent-circuit model on impedance data 
obtained  under  different  current  densities  so  as  to  characterise 
the  resistance  in  the  fuel  and  air  electrodes.  The  integration  of 
the charge transfer resistance with respect to the current density 
yields the mathematical manifestation of the activation overpoten- 
tial as a function of the current density.

act,k  is the activation overpotential of electrode k, r 

where η
ct,k  is 
the charge transfer resistance associated with electrode k , and a

is a constant of integration. 

Experimental  values  of  the  charge  transfer  resistance  can  be 
ﬁtted  by  means  of  a  function  in  a  deﬁned range,  for  instance a 
polynomial, in which the current density is the variable term. The 
Dirichlet boundary condition for Eq. (111) is that under open circuit 
voltage the activation overpotential is zero. Hence the constant of 
integration can be evaluated. 

The second stage of the methodology foresees to ﬁt with the 
Butler-Volmer  equation  the  points  generated  from  the  activation

electrode. Data were analysed and compared to evaluate the im- 
pact of temperature, fuel composition, fuel utilisation and current 
load. It is critical to extrapolate degradation rates evaluated dur- 
ing the ﬁrst 10 0 0 to 20 0 0 hours of operation because the degrada- 
tion levels off after time. In [388] , the analysis of the difference of 
impedance spectra [389] was applied to study the degradation of 
SOECs. Approaches that enable deconvolution of different degrada- 
tion mechanisms are essential to obtain parameters for a degrada- 
tion model. The degradation is measured at ﬁxed operating condi- 
tions without lateral gradients, which would result in an inhomo- 
geneous degradation. Large-area cells or stacks, exhibiting exten- 
sive gradients in temperature and gas composition, should not be 
used to resolve individual degradation mechanisms, although they 
are still useful to parameterise 0-D models without spatial resolu- 
tion. 

Overall, the most common measurement of degradation is by 
measuring the i (cid:3)(cid:3) -V relation, e.g., the development of the cell volt- 
age under a constant current [390] . This is clear and simple for 
a description of the overall cell degradation over time. However, 
it does not reveal the origins of the degradation. The impedance 
spectrum is another commonly used measurement of degradation 
and  can  provide more  in-depth information  [391] .  Both  the  i (cid:3)(cid:3) -V 
curve and impedance spectrum are usually used to measure the 
degradation of the whole fuel cell and are the only known meth- 
ods that can be applied operando . Different measurements are used 
to characterise the degradations of individual cell components, and 
these generally require post-operation characterisation. 

The degradation of interconnectors usually comes from the ox- 
idation  of  interconnect  material,  which  can  be  measured  by  the 
increase  of  resistance  and  the  weight  gain.  The  area-speciﬁc  re- 
sistance  is  usually  measured  by  a  4  probe  DC  technique  [392] . 
The measured resistance and weight gain are used to deduce the 
parameters concerning the interconnect oxide scale growth [393] . 
The  degradation  mechanisms  of  the  SOFC  fuel  electrode  include 
different  phenomena  such  as  micro-structural  alteration,  coking, 
poisoning by fuel impurities, and redox-cycling. These are accom- 
panied by a change of microstructure of the fuel electrode that can 
be measured by SEM imaging [394] . Through analysis of SEM im- 
ages of the composite fuel electrode at different times, the changes 
in the particle sizes of Ni and YSZ, and the porosity and pore sizes 
of the fuel electrode can be obtained. The TPB length may be de- 
duced from the microstructure data obtained by the SEM image 
[395] . The change in the fuel electrode conductivity is usually mea- 
sured by a 4-probe DC technique. 

Degradation  of  the  electrolyte  originates  from  the  decline  of 
ionic conductivity of electrolyte materials such as YSZ. The ionic 
conductivity can be measured by a 4 probe DC technique, while 
the  impedance  spectrum  can  be  used  to  identify  the  contribu- 
tion of the bulk and grain boundary resistivity on the degradation 
of  the  electrolyte  [ 396 , 397 ].  TEM  and  SEM  have  also  been  used 
to measure the microstructure change of YSZ [398] . Degradation 
mechanisms of the air electrode include interfacial chemical reac- 
tions, microstructure change, and chromium poisoning. The chem- 
ical reactions between air electrode materials and electrolyte ma- 
terials will happen during the sintering process and cell operation 
at high temperatures [399] . X-ray diffraction is often used to iden- 
tify the reaction product. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is also 
used to measure the Sr segregation on the surface of the LSM/BSCF 
[400] .  Microstructural  changes  of  the  air  electrode  can  be  mea- 
sured by SEM imaging [ 401 , 402 ]. The change of the particle size 
of L SM/L SCF and YSZ, the porosity of air electrode and the pore 
sizes can be obtained through analysis of SEM images. Chromium 
poisoning affects the electrochemical activity and the stability of 
air electrode and impedance spectroscopy is often used to measure 
the inﬂuence of poisoning [403] . 

4. Conclusion and recommendations 

In this review the governing equations for modelling SOCs on 
the continuum scale have been presented, with recommendations 
for their use, together with an outline for future research needed 
on the topic. 

The  objectives  of  an  SOC  model  include  the  desire  to  under- 
stand and predict operational behaviour, and degradation, in order 
to lead in the direction of continuous improvement of the technol- 
ogy. With enhanced predictability of SOCs and stacks, safe opera- 
tion strategies can be devised, and better designs made. This will 
enhance product lifetime, and increase the competitiveness of the 
technology. This work focused on simulations at the cell and stack 
level, while also bridging towards microstructural scale and exper- 
imental approaches, for a more precise prediction of the effective 
material parameters used at the cell and stack scales. 

Thus this work covers the modelling of SOCs at multiple length 
scales,  and  as  found  in  this  paper  it  is  clear  that  an  enormous 
effort  has  already  gone  into  multiphysics  model  development.  It 
is  also  clear that  various  approaches for  simplifying the  govern- 
ing partial differential equations have been successfully applied to 
minimise  computational  load.  But  as  discussed,  the  authors  also 
note  that  there  is  a  need  to  provide  a  stronger  focus  on  multi- 
scale models, which can bind together the phenomena occurring 
at the different length scales into a single model. This can be done 
either by using computational clusters, or so-called homogenisa- 
tion and localisation, to combine the models at the different length 
scales. 

Various effort s f or modelling the microstructure of the porous 
electrodes  were  thus  described.  Likewise,  advanced  experimen- 
tal methods, using impedance spectroscopy and relaxation times, 
were covered. Both can provide a better understanding of the ef- 
fective cell/stack parameters. The authors ﬁnd that while there are 
relatively  few  works  that  combine  advanced  experimental  tech- 
niques  and  microstructural  scale  models,  there  is  much  to  be 
learned by doing so. For multi-species mass and heat transfer in 
porous media, there still appear to be many different models, with 
no consensus on which is the needed level of complexity. This is 
needs to be addressed by the community. 

There is no single set of formula for developing a good math- 
ematical model of a SOC; a range of possibilities exist for the de- 
scription of heat and mass transfer, electric ﬁeld potentials, over- 
potentials, and current density. These range from simple rate equa- 
tions combined with an ASR based on lumped parameters, to com- 
plex transient 3-D two potential models, involving a breakdown of 
all salient physicochemical processes in a detailed manner. In this 
paper we have outlined the different routes and discussed the lim- 
itations and advantages. While many modern CFD and other codes 
contain well-developed mathematics, which are amenable to rela- 
tively comprehensive models by previous standards, the modeller 
will still be posed with the challenge to strike a balance between 
described detail and computational speed and memory, to obtain 
the desired result. 

To predict lifetime performance of SOCs, this paper also covers 
various work on degradation. While some simple physical relation- 
ships can be used to describe certain degradation phenomena at 
the  continuum  scale;  others  occur  at  a  submicron  level,  making 
the bridging of length scales more challenging, or (at this stage) 
impossible. Thus, advanced characterisation of SOCs over their life- 
time is essential to predict the lifetime of a stack with the cells 
operating at various conditions through the stack. The stochastic 
nature of these processes and the length of time required to make 
statistically signiﬁcant tests are formidable challenges for the em- 
pirical  communities  of  scientists.  Some  works  have  covered  this 
area, but the immense experimental effort needed for this has lim- 
ited model development. As the technologies mature, systematic 

38

characterisation must be undertaken to a greater extent and degra- 
dation must be put in the frame of a stack with various operating 
points inside. Ideally, degradation should be modelled transiently 
for a full stack, such that time dependent interactions between dif- 
ferent parts of the stack are described. 

Due to the high operating temperatures of SOCs, ceramics are 
extensively used in the current stacks with the potential for brit- 
tle  failure  of  cells  and  interfaces.  In  this  work  we  have  also  re- 
viewed various works  on mechanical modelling of failure in the 
SOC  stacks.  Detailed  models  for  fracture  in  interfaces,  creep  of 
components and statistical analysis of cell failure have been pre- 
sented in the literature, but not in an integrated manner and not 
for a full stack, due to the computational load. This, again, sets a 
target for the SOC modelling community: A full stack model in- 
cluding both time dependent mechanical behaviour and the impact 
on the chance of failure of the various components. 

Public data bases, containing effective property values suitable 
for solid oxide materials, are not commonly encountered. Obtained 
data should be shared openly for researchers to work-with, jointly. 
There is a need for further developing standardised experimental 
techniques/results, which precisely mimic the constraints of mod- 
els; for instance employing highly-insulated full-sized cells, under 
steady-state conditions, as well as miniature button cells. Similarly, 
it is recommended that the research community work towards es- 
tablishing an open dataset of reliable test data from stack exper- 
iments and relevant stack design which is publicly available. The 
data should contain as much interior information as possible, e.g., 
from thermal probes during operation. 

Originally,  scientists  wrote  simple  codes  in  source  languages 
such  as  FORTRAN  and  C  [ 23 , 74 ].  Subsequently  general  purpose 
commercial  CFD  codes  were  modiﬁed,  both  by  code  developers 
and end users, in user-deﬁned functions and subroutines. The code 
vendors often worked in tandem with industry and academia to 
improve the functionality. In the last 10 years, open source codes 
have been used increasingly as the basis for the development of 
modern SOC models. The object-oriented paradigm allows for over- 
loading of models; for instance different diffusion or kinetics mod- 
els can be implemented in different SOC parts at run time. This 
facilitates comparison of sub-component models. Moreover, open 
source  code  libraries  can  be  freely  shared  in  international  col- 
laborations,  and  the  license  model  is  favourable  to  high  perfor- 
mance computing installations. For example, the CFD code Open- 
FOAM was used as a basis for the development of the openFuelCell 
code [ 124 , 297 ]. Cantera [ 65 , 66 ] is another example of an object- 
oriented code that can be applied to electrochemical applications. 
This trend is likely to continue in the future and is to be encour- 
aged. The IEA Advanced Fuel Cells Technology Collaboration Pro- 
gramme,  Annex  37,  was  speciﬁcally  set  up  to  allow  for  the  dis- 
cussion and comparison of open source codes in electrochemical 
applications. 

While much progress has been made over the last 3 decades, 
the science and engineering both  of SOC  modelling, and experi- 
mental parameterisation, and visualisation are still young and vi- 
tal. Mathematical/computer models are a fact-of-life in modern en- 
gineering  practice,  not  only  for  improving  existing  products,  but 
increasingly-so  for  those  under  development.  With  patient  and 
careful development of validated models, the disruptive changes to 
the barriers required to allow this important technological innova- 
tion to achieve market penetration, can be overcome. 

It is hard to predict the future of SOC technology; Transporta- 
tion  applications  for  SOFCs  will  most  likely  be  conﬁned  to  con- 
stant operation uses, for example in the shipping industry. Prob- 
ably, in the immediate future, the widest application for SOC tech- 
nology  is  going  to  be  SOECs,  as  the  need  for  water  electroly- 
sis  expands,  and  SOECs  are  currently  more  eﬃcient  than  other 
(alkaline  and  polymer  electrolyte)  electrolysers,  when  integrated 

with downstream processes. Micro co-generation systems may also 
have  a  role,  but  at  the  present  time  are  too  expensive.  A  posi- 
tion paper describing the state of SOC technology was published 
by the IEA [404] . Other reports [ 20 , 405 , 406 ] are concerned with 
the techno-economic concerns related to solid-oxide and other fuel 
cell and electrolyser technologies and the barriers to market pen- 
etration  facing  the  business,  the  main  concerns  being  reliability 
and  cost.  If  and  when  these  can  be  addressed,  the  technology 
will  be  able  to  contribute  to  sustainable  energy  in  a  signiﬁcant 
way.
