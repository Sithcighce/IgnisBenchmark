Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) has arisen during last years as a very promising combustion technology
for power plants and industrial applications, with inherent CO2 capture which reduces the energy penalty
imposed on other competing technologies. The use of solid fuels in CLC has been highly developed in the
last decade and currently stands at a technical readiness level (TRL) of 6. In this paper, experience gained
during CLC operation in continuous units is reviewed and appraised, focusing mainly on technical and envi-
ronmental issues relating to the use of solid fuels. Up to now, more than 2700 h of operational experience
has been reported in 19 pilot plants ranging from 0.5 kWth to 4 MWth. When designing a CLC unit of solid
fuels, the preferred configuration for the scale-up is a two circulating fluidized beds (CFB) system. Coal has
been the most commonly used solid fuel in CLC, but biomass has recently emerged as a very promising
option to achieve negative emissions using bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS).
Mostly low cost iron and manganese materials have been used as oxygen carriers in the so called in-situ gas-
ification CLC (iG-CLC). The development of Chemical Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU) makes a
qualitative step forward in the solid fuel combustion, due to the use of materials able to release oxygen. The
performance and environmental issues of CLC of solid fuels is evaluated here. Regarding environmental
aspects, the pollutant emissions (SO2, NOx, etc.) released into the atmosphere from the air reactor are no
cause of concern for the environment. However, the presence of SO2, NOx and Hg at the exit of the fuel reac-
tor affects CO2 quality, which must be taken into account during the later compression and purification
stages. The effect of the main variables affecting CLC performance is evaluated for fuel conversion, CO2 cap-
ture rate, and combustion efficiency obtained in different CLC units. Solid fuel conversion is normally not
complete during operation, due to the undesired loss of char. A methodology is presented to extrapolate
the current information to what could be expected in a larger CLC system. CO2 capture near 100% has been
reported using a highly efficient carbon stripper, highly reactive fuels (such as lignites and biomass, etc.) or
by the CLOU process. Operational experience in iG-CLC has showed that it is not possible to reach complete
fuel combustion, making an additional oxygen polishing step necessary. For the further scale-up, it is essen-
tial to reduce the unburnt compounds at the fuel reactor outlet. Proposals to achieve this reduction already
exist and include both improvement to the gas-oxygen carrier contact, or new design concepts based on the
current scheme for iG-CLC. In addition, CLOU based on copper materials has shown that complete fuel com-
bustion could be achieved. Main challenges for the future development and scale-up of CLC technology
have been also identified. A breakthrough in the future development of CLC technology for solid fuels will
come from developing long-life materials for CLOU that are easy to recover from the ash purge stream.

1. Introduction

PThe Paris Agreement, the new treaty of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that will sub-
stitute the Kyoto Protocol, urges decarbonization of the world
energy systems in the near future in order to limit the average world
temperature rising to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels [1]. Chemical
Looping Combustion (CLC) is recognized as a promising approach to
CO2 capture in processes requiring the combustion of a fuel for both
heating and/or electricity generation [2]. Compared to other CO2
capture technologies, CLC can gain dramatic energy savings through
its inherent avoidance of any gas separation step [3]. The estimated
costs per ton of CO2 captured for a CLC plant burning solid fuels is
around 20 USD/t CO2 [4], significantly lower than those estimated
for post-combustion technologies (36(cid:1)53 USD/t CO2), pre-combus-
tion capture (28(cid:1)41 USD/t CO2) and oxycombustion (36(cid:1)67 USD/t
CO2) [5,6]. The basic principle behind this technology is preventing
air and fuel mixing in the combustion chamber, as occurs in conven-
tional combustion. In CLC, the oxygen needed for combustion is sup-
plied through a redox cycle, where a solid oxygen carrier, normally a
metal oxide, is reduced to supply the oxygen and then re-oxidized
again by air.

PCLC has been developed for combustion of gaseous, liquid and
solid fuels, and is undergoing significant scale up at present [7(cid:1)9]. In
the early 2000s, the development of CLC technology gave a signifi-
cant boost to combustion of gaseous fuels, mainly natural gas. Major
advances were made in developing oxygen carrier materials
[7,10,11] and demonstrating the CLC process in several units
[7,12,13], with the 120 kWth unit at Vienna University of Technology
being the flagship of the CLC combustion with gaseous fuels [14].
Nowadays, the challenge in developing CLC technology with gaseous
fuels is the scale-up both of the process, which is intended to be
demonstrated at the 10 MWth scale [15], and the production of
highly reactive and durable oxygen carrier materials with no nickel
in their composition [16(cid:1)19]. Also, the combustion of syngas or nat-
ural gas in a pressurized CLC system is being explored, which would
increase the net efficiency of the process for electricity generation
by using gas and steam turbines in a combined cycle [20,21]. Most of
the development with pressurized CLC systems is based on a battery
of fixed bed reactors with gas switching [22(cid:1)24], but also pressur-
ized and interconnected reactors with an oxygen carrier circulating
between them are being assessed [25,26]. Recently, combustion of
liquid fuels has received attention in order to use heavy fuels
[27(cid:1)29] or renewable fuels such as bio-ethanol [30]. To reach the
goal set by the Paris Agreement, CO2 emissions should start to
decrease by 2020 and become negative by the end of the century
[31,32]. This fact combined with the important role of coal combus-
tion in the future energy mix [33,34] have acted as driving forces to

Pboost the development of CLC technology with both coal and bio-
mass as fuels.

PSignificant developments have been made in the combustion of
solid fuels using Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) during the last
decade. Progress in this technology up to mid-2011 was reviewed in
a previous work [7], and later a brief description of operational expe-
rience up to mid-2013 was done by Lyngfelt [35]. Thus, operation of
two 10 kWth CLC units, located at Chalmers University of Technology
(Sweden) and Southeast University (China) [36(cid:1)39], was described
in that review. CLC with solid fuels was first demonstrated with pet-
coke and bituminous coal at Chalmers University of Technology in
2008 [36,37]. Moreover, results obtained with various oxygen
carriers (ilmenite and iron ore) as well as solid fuels, including
different coals and biomass, proved the technology to be reliable
In total, about 2700 h of operational experience was

reported. These promising results encouraged the design and
construction of other units and important new knowledge has
been gained in the last 5 years [41], including experience in a
1 MWth unit at Darmstadt University of Technology [42] and a
3 MWth unit by Alstom USA [43,44].

PIn this paper, the state of the art of the CLC operation with
solid fuels in existing CLC facilities is reviewed and updated. An
overview of the more relevant results obtained in these units is
presented and results are appraised based on the design and
operating conditions used in each CLC unit. In order to compare
results presented in different research works, a methodology is
given which enables the experimental results obtained from the
units to be analyzed in depth.
In addition, future needs and
research areas are presented.

2. Description of the CLC process with solid fuels

PThe scheme of the CLC process with solid fuels is shown in Fig. 1.
The solid fuel is fed into the fuel reactor and mixed with the oxygen
carrier particles. Then, devolatilization takes place and char is gener-
ated. The interaction between char and oxygen carrier can take place
if a close contact between solid particles is ensured [45,46] as it is
the case of fixed/moving bed reactors. However, this interaction is
not of relevance under fluidized bed conditions [47] where the gas-
solid contact is favored. Therefore, most of the experimental units
operate under the so-called in situ Gasification Chemical Looping
Combustion (iG-CLC) mode schematized in Fig. 2. Under this com-
bustion mode, the solid fuel gasification by steam and/or CO2 takes
place in the fuel reactor following the scheme described by reactions
(R1)-(R3). The process was designed to use steam as a gasifying and
fluidizing agent. However, recirculated streams, wet or dry, includ-
ing a mixture of H2OþCO2 can also be used (see Fig. 1). The products
generated during coal devolatilization and gasification are oxidized
by the oxygen carrier particles following reaction (R4) to produce

POnce steam is condensed, an almost pure CO2 stream is obtained.
Thus, the oxygen carrier is reduced in the fuel reactor, and then
transferred to the air reactor, where it is re-oxidized using air; see
reaction (R6).

PThe ash generated in the combustion should be periodically
purged to avoid accumulation in the CLC system, although this can
lead to a certain loss of oxygen carrier. A makeup flow of oxygen car-
rier should also be added to correct this loss and that caused by par-
ticle attrition.

PFollowing the scheme presented in Fig. 1, experimental units
mostly based on two interconnected fluidized bed reactors have
been built recently and operated to burn different types of coal with
varying thermal power capacities. Gasification of char in the fuel
reactor is the limiting step in coal conversion. If char is not fully con-
verted in the fuel reactor, some of the char leaves the fuel reactor
together with the oxygen carrier. Should the unconverted char reach
the air reactor, it is burnt there producing CO2 which is not captured,
thus reducing the CO2 capture efficiency of this technology. The use

Pof a carbon stripper has been proposed to minimize the amount of
char transferred to the air reactor by separating the unconverted
char exiting the fuel reactor from the oxygen carrier, as shown in
Fig. 1 [48(cid:1)51]. Studies on the efficiency of the carbon stripper have
been carried out in order to evaluate the performance of iG-CLC on
CO2 capture [49] and to optimize the design and operation [50,51].

PIn general, incomplete combustion of volatiles and char gasifi-
cation products at
the fuel reactor has been
observed. The presence of unburnt products could make an oxy-
gen polishing step necessary, which would increase the cost of
iG-CLC technology [4]. The oxygen polishing step is described as
a process in which highly concentrated oxygen is used to com-
plete the combustion of gaseous products from the fuel reactor;
see Fig. 1. Some design suggestions have been proposed and

Panalyzed in order to minimize the presence of unburnt com-
pounds [52], and their implementation in iG-CLC units is still
ongoing. The use of a moving bed as a fuel reactor has also
shown high combustion efficiency [53]. Selection of the oxygen
carrier may also improve CLC performance with solid fuels. Thus,
a more reactive oxygen carrier has been shown to improve the
combustion efficiency, with the resulting decrease in the oxygen
required for oxygen polishing [54,55].

PFurther improvement is achieved using materials with oxygen
uncoupling capability [55(cid:1)58]. In Chemical Looping with Oxygen
Uncoupling schematized in Fig. 2 [59], the oxygen carrier is able
to generate gaseous oxygen in the fuel reactor environment; see
reaction (R7). Volatile matter and solid char are then burnt by
oxygen as in conventional combustion, following reactions (R8)

PChar and volatile matter conversion are better in CLOU than in
iG-CLC. In fact, char gasification can limit the CO2 capture, whereas
the need to burn the volatiles and gasification products with the
oxygen carrier hinders complete combustion in iG-CLC. [56,60,61].
However, the combustion process with the gaseous O2 released by
the oxygen carrier in CLOU returns better results on efficiency.

PThe in-situ Gasification Chemical Looping Combustion process
(iG-CLC) has drawn great interest due to the use of low cost oxygen
carriers [7], although synthetic oxygen carriers are usually consid-
ered for CLOU [62(cid:1)64]. Recently, great efforts have been made to
develop suitable materials for use as oxygen carriers in CLOU, mainly
focused on copper oxide [65(cid:1)73] or combined oxides of Mn with
other metals such as Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe or Si [74(cid:1)88]. However, the com-
bined oxides tested to date have not shown oxygen release capaci-
ties as high as copper oxide. When used in a continuous unit, they
will act mainly as an iG-CLC oxygen carrier, but with the advantage
of an additional gaseous oxygen contribution. This new concept was
identified as Chemical Looping assisted by Oxygen Uncoupling
(CLaOU) and it is in its early development stages [89]. Some studies
have also centered on the use of natural ores or waste materials as
an oxygen carrier for CLOU [90(cid:1)94], which often requires a concen-
tration stage of the active compound. However, experience in oper-
ating CLOU to burn solid fuels is still very limited. Tables 1 and 2
summarize the chemical properties and chemical reactions taking
place for the main redox pairs used in iG-CLC and CLOU combustion.

3. CLC units for solid fuel combustion

PTo date, there are 19 CLC pilot plants worldwide burning solid
fuels in the range 1 kWth to 3 MWth and a few new upcoming units.
A brief summary including location, hours of operation and type of
oxygen carriers tested is presented in Table 3. In addition, Fig. 3
shows an overview of the distribution of the operating CLC units for
year of operation, thermal power and location. The CLC units
included in Table 3 will be described in some detail in the following
sections. To make their status clear, they have been grouped into
two categories: small or lab-scale units and semi-industrial scale
units.

3.1. Small and lab-scale units

PThis section describes CLC units existing at lab-scale, as well as
the main operating conditions including the oxygen carrier and solid
fuels used. All these facilities are bound by the common feature of
having air and fuel reactors, with the oxygen carrier circulating
between both. Facilities operating with a thermal power of about
1(cid:1)5 kWth are deemed to be small units, while prototypes in the
10(cid:1)100 kWth range are defined as lab-scale units. However, several
configurations can be found in the existing CLC units which would
influence the performance of the system. Figs. 4(cid:1)18 show the
scheme of the different experimental units included here.

P3.1.1. Chalmers University of Technology (CUT, Sweden)

PThe research group of Prof. Lyngfelt at Chalmers University of
Technology has long experience in CLC of solid fuels and operated
two units, 10 and 100 kWth, with different types of solid fuels (bitu-
minous coals, petcoke, woodchar).

PThe first operation of CLC with solid fuels in a 10 kWth unit was
presented in 2008 [36]. This unit consisted of two interconnected
fluidized beds acting as fuel and air reactors, as shown in Fig. 4A. The
fuel reactor was divided into three chambers: a low velocity part
(bubbling fluidized bed) where the fuel particles were devolatilized
and gasified, a carbon stripper to separate unreacted coal particles
from the oxygen carrier particles, and a high velocity part to help
char particles back to the fuel reactor via a small cyclone fitted at the
entrance to the fuel reactor. The air reactor was a high velocity fluid-
ized bed connected to a riser to bring the oxygen carrier particles
back to the fuel reactor. Coal was fed into the upper part of the fuel
reactor, in the low velocity part. This design caused most of the vola-
tiles from coal to escape as unburnt products from the fuel reactor.
Later, the design was improved by extending the fuel feeding pipe so
that the fuel discharged inside the bed [115]. Operation run has used
ilmenite [36,37,114,115,118,119], manganese ore [54,115,116] or
CaMn-based perovskites-type materials [57,117] as an oxygen car-
rier. Improved results were found for CaMn-based perovskites as, in
this case, a fraction of the transferred oxygen can be released as
molecular oxygen [171]. Thus, a fraction of the fuel would be burnt
via CLOU [172]. However, this material should be limited to non-sul-
furous fuels, such as biomass, due to the deactivation problems
encountered [117]. Bituminous coals have often been used in these
works, but low-volatile fuels, such as petcoke or biochar, have been
preferred in order to achieve high combustion efficiency in this unit
[173].

PIn 2012, Lyngfelt et al. built a 100 kWth CLC experimental unit for
solid fuels [123,174] consisting of two interconnected circulating
fluidized beds with a carbon stripper between both reactors, as
shown in Fig. 4B. The carbon stripper comprised four chambers to
ensure high-efficiency separation of char particles. Before entering
the carbon stripper, the solids were transferred from the bottom of
the fuel reactor to the circulation riser. This allowed recirculation of
the solids flow to be controlled by adjusting the flow fed to the circu-
lation riser and also raising the solids to the carbon stripper level, for
transport to the air reactor by gravity. By changing the fluidization
velocity in the air reactor and the circulation riser, it should be possi-
ble to control the fuel reactor bed inventory and global solids circu-
lation independently. Moreover, this unit was designed to have in-
bed feeding of the fuel.

PThe scale-up of materials successfully tested in other units, e.g.
10 kWth at CUT or 0.5 kWth at ICB-CSIC, has been carried out in this
100 kWth CLC unit, which has been operated with Fe-based oxygen
carriers, such as ilmenite and iron ore, and different types of
solid fuels: bituminous coal, petroleum coke and wood char
[100,121,123,124]. Also, adding manganese ore to the well-known
ilmenite material returned satisfactory results [122]. The knowledge
gained from the operation gave clear indications of the viability of the
CLC process for solid fuels. For example, the carbon stripper was found
to be highly efficient in separating unconverted char particles from the
oxygen carrier [120], thus the CO2 capture was close to 100%.

P3.1.2. Southeast University (SU, China)

PIn the School of Energy and Environment at Southeast University
in Nanjing two continuous CLC units were built and operated by the
group headed by Prof. Shen. These units have a similar design, but
the thermal power was different: 1 and 10 kWth sketched in Fig. 5,
respectively [38,126]. In both cases, the air reactor is a fast fluidized
bed and the fuel reactor is a spouted bed. This configuration was
selected as there is an excellent mixing of solids in this type of reac-
tor ensuring good mixing between the coal and oxygen carrier.

PThe first operation in these prototypes was performed using Ni-
based oxygen carriers. Nevertheless, the use of nickel is not recom-
mended for CLC of solid fuels, as these materials can contaminate
the drained ashes and loose reactivity in presence of sulfur-contain-
ing fuels [125,175,176]. The presence of Ni in the ash may be

Punavoidable, thus generating a dangerous residue in the process.
Later, limited operation was carried out using sintered iron oxide
powders [39]. The 10 kWth unit has been successfully tested in the
combustion of coal and biomass with Ni- and Fe-based oxygen car-
riers. The fuel reactor has an inner seal to difficult unconverted char
particles being present in the oxygen carrier stream entering to the
air reactor. However, the inner seal could not difficult the char
bypassing from the fuel reactor to the air reactor.

PIn the 1 kWth CLC unit at Southeast University, char separation
was improved by using an external loop-seal connecting the fuel
reactor with the air reactor [126]. The fuel conversion was also
improved by introducing the fuel particles at the bottom of the
spouted-fluidized bed, as seen in the scheme of the unit presented
in Fig. 5. Exhaustive operations have been carried out in this unit,
where iron ores based on hematite were used to burn different types
of coal, biomass and in the co-combustion of coal and biomass
[127(cid:1)129,133]. The iron ore was also modified with potassium with
the aim of increasing the char gasification rate, and hence the CO2
capture [130]. Recently, combustion experiments with sewage
sludge have been performed, also using hematite as oxygen carrier
[131,132,134]. In this case, the study focused on the fate of phos-
phorous compounds present in the fuel.

PAlso at Southeast University (China), a 50 kWth CLC unit working
under pressurized conditions (PCLC) was built and operated by Xiao
et al. [135]. The fuel and air reactors were designed to be operated in
fast and turbulent fluidization regimes, respectively; see Fig. 6. The
fast fluidization regime in the fuel reactor can improve the gas-solid
contact in addition to the contact between coal and oxygen carrier
particles. Furthermore, this configuration together with the pressur-
ized operation leads to a lower oxygen carrier inventory. Experi-
ments were performed in the 1(cid:1)5 atm range using a bituminous
coal as fuel and an iron ore as oxygen carrier. A CO2 concentration of
97.2% in the exhaust gas in the fuel reactor working at 5 atm abso-
lute pressure was obtained.

P3.1.3. Instituto de Carboquímica (ICB-CSIC, Spain)

PThe group headed by Prof. Ad(cid:1)anez at the Instituto de Carboquí-
mica belonging to the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científi-
cas (ICB-CSIC) has run two CLC units, including operation both in iG-

PCLC and CLOU modes burning coal and biomass. The first experimen-
tal continuous unit (nominal power 0.5 kWth in iG-CLC and 1.5 kWth
in CLOU) [136] (see Fig. 7A), consisted of two fluidized bed reactors,
connected by a U-shaped fluidized bed acting as a loop seal. In the
0.5 kWth unit, the fuel reactor was a bubbling fluidized bed where
the coal was fed at the bottom and just above the fuel reactor distrib-
utor plate. This configuration provided good contact between oxy-
gen carrier particles and gases from coal conversion, i.e. volatile
matter and gasification products. The reduced oxygen carrier was
re-oxidized in the air reactor. The oxidized oxygen carrier was
entrained through a riser from the air reactor and returned to the
fuel reactor. The solids flow returning to the fuel reactor was regu-
lated by a solids valve, and the value of this flow could also be mea-
sured through a diverting solids valve. This feature enabled proper
evaluation of the effect of the solids circulation flow rate on the per-
formance of the process.

PNote that this unit does not include a carbon stripper, so uncon-
verted char escaping to the air reactor was only affected by the resi-
dence time of solids in the fuel reactor. This fact facilitates the
evaluation of results obtained in the unit on char conversion and
CO2 capture. Thus, char conversion rates are often given from
tests carried out with different oxygen carriers and fuels such as
bituminous coal, lignite, anthracite and biomass [101,136(cid:1)140].
This information can be used in theoretical models for design and
optimization purposes [177,178].

PExperiments in iG-CLC mode with different oxygen carrier mate-
rials based on iron, such as natural ilmenite [136(cid:1)138], iron ore
[101,139,141], Fe-ESF which is a residue from bauxite treatment
[140], and a synthetic Fe-Mn-based material [79] have been per-
formed. Ilmenite, a mineral composed of FeTiO3 and a highly reac-
tive iron ore were used in the combustion of coals from anthracite to
lignite with high sulfur content [101,137]. An increase in the CO2
capture and combustion efficiencies with temperature was
observed. The CO2 capture efficiency increased with decreasing coal
rank, and higher CO2 capture values were obtained for lignite com-
pared to anthracite. The use of Fe-ESF, iron ore and Fe-Mn-based
material improved the results obtained with ilmenite, especially
combustion efficiency [55,79,101,140]. Biomass was also used as
fuel, obtaining promising results, with high CO2 capture values even

Ref. [174].

Pwhen CO2 was utilized as a fluidizing agent in the fuel reactor
[139,141].

PThis unit was where the proof of concept for the CLOU process in
burning coal was demonstrated for the first time using a bituminous
coal and a Cu-based oxygen carrier consisting of 60% CuO supported
on MgAl2O4 [142]. Complete combustion of coal was observed in all
cases and CO2 capture values close to 100% were obtained at 960 °C
in the fuel reactor. The CO2 capture level depended on the coal rank
and fuel reactor temperature, as assessed in experiments with the
same oxygen carrier and coals from anthracite to lignite. The highest
CO2 capture efficiencies were reached with lignite and medium-
volatile bituminous coals [58]. Using biomass as fuel improved CO2
capture and 100% CO2 capture was reached at 935 °C [143]. Recently,
a Cu-Mn mixed oxide was also tested as a CLOU oxygen carrier with
a sub-bituminous coal, reaching complete combustion in all cases
[88]. Coal combustion assisted by oxygen uncoupling (CLOaU mode)
was also performed in this unit using a Fe-Mn-based material. The
amount of oxygen released when using this oxygen carrier was sig-
nificant when the solids circulation rate between fuel and air reac-
tors was increased, as well as when optimizing the oxidation
conditions in the air reactor [79].

PAlso at ICB-CSIC, an experimental unit of 50 kWth for solid fuel
combustion was recently built and operated [144]. The system
included two interconnected circulating fluidized beds as fuel and
air reactors (Fig. 7B). The fuel reactor is a circulating fluidized bed
with a substantial dense phase at the bottom, which adds flexibility
to the gas-solid contact. This unit also incorporated a carbon stripper
between the fuel and air reactors. In addition, a double loop-seal
below the fuel reactor cyclone allowed the solids circulation rate to

Pbe controlled independently from operating conditions in air or fuel
reactors. Evaluation of the effect of operating conditions on the CO2
capture and combustion efficiencies was carried out with ilmenite
as the oxygen carrier and a bituminous coal as fuel [145], so that
optimum operating conditions could be determined. The effect of
the carbon stripper efficiency on the CO2 capture efficiency was also
investigated to determine optimum conditions in the unit. In order
to improve combustion efficiency, the riser in the fuel reactor was
modified by adding ring-type internals to boost gas-solid contact.
The effect of the internals was also evaluated using ilmenite as oxy-
gen carrier and bituminous coal. It was found that the presence of
internals improved oxidation of volatile matter in the form of meth-
ane and led to the full conversion of hydrogen [146].

P3.1.4. IFP Energies Nouvelles (IFPEN, France)

PIFP Energies Nouvelles (IFPEN) headed by Prof. Gauthier et al., in
an R&D project in collaboration with Total S.A., modified an existing
10 kWth CLC unit for gaseous fuels to burn solid fuels [147]. This unit
consists of three interconnected bubbling fluidized bed reactors
(one fuel reactor and two air reactors, AR1 and AR2) and a carbon
stripper (Fig. 8). The carbon stripper prevented unconverted char
from entering the air reactor, but separated char was not recircu-
lated to the fuel reactor. The solids circulation between reactors was
controlled by pneumatic L-valves. Solids at the exit of the L-valve
were transported through a vertical riser, followed by a horizontal
conveying line. Solid-gas separation was then performed in a
cyclone. Experiments were done in this unit using a bituminous coal
and a natural ore (BMP) as oxygen carrier.

P3.1.5. Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH, Germany)

PAt Hamburg University of Technology, a 25 kWth CLC system of
coupled fluidized beds for CLC was tested by the group headed by
Prof. Werther [148]. The continuous CLC unit consisted of a circulat-
ing fluidized bed (air reactor) coupled with a two-stage bubbling flu-
idized bed (fuel reactor), as seen in Fig. 9. The two stages in the fuel
reactor were set one above the other. The solid fuel entered the
lower bed where gasification took place. In the upper bed, the gases
leaving the lower bed can react with fresh oxygen carrier particles.
The purpose of this two-stage fuel reactor is to enhance the conver-
sion of combustible gases released in the lower fuel reactor stage by
putting them in contact with freshly regenerated oxygen carrier par-
ticles in the upper stage. The lower bed also acts as carbon stripper
when fine fuel was used. The first experiments conducted in this
unit used Australian ilmenite as an oxygen carrier and lignite as fuel
[148]. Good volatile matter conversion was observed due to the use
of the upper fuel reactor, but there was also high CO and H2 concen-
tration in the flue gases. This fact was explained by char particles
entering the upper fuel reactor, where they were entrained with the
flue gases. Gasification of segregated char particles generates H2 and
CO which could not have the chance to react with the oxygen carrier
particles. Some instability in the solids circulation was also reported.
In experiments with a low solids inventory, most of the fluidization
gas used in the fuel reactor and in the downcomer was found in the
air reactor [179]. A Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model was
developed to simulate this CLC unit and identify the origin of the
instability. It was found that an increased pressure drop in the gas
distributor in the upper stage of the fuel reactor caused a decrease in

Pthe level of solids in the right hand side of the downcomer, thereby
facilitating the flow of the fluidizing gas in the fuel reactor to the air
reactor. These types of simulations can be used in the future to draft
guidelines for optimum operation of the unit. The last operations
reported in this unit used an oxygen carrier based on CuO supported
on g-Al2O3 in the temperature range 800(cid:1)900 °C to burn two types
of coal, i.e. lignite and bituminous coal [149]. These conditions allow
work in iG-CLC mode, but with some gaseous oxygen release at the
highest temperature. Although it is not clearly stated, the experi-
ments performed at 800(cid:1)850 °C are thought to be in iG-CLC mode,
as the amount of oxygen released at those temperatures is almost
negligible. Regardless of the coal used, almost complete conversion
of the combustible gases was reached after the second stage of the
fuel reactor. The composition of the gases leaving the first stage was
also analyzed in the experiments performed. It was concluded that,
with bituminous coal, the second stage could be eliminated, as the
combustion efficiency was already high after the first bubbling bed.
Therefore, the research group is currently working on a new design
of the fuel reactor to allow coal feed into both stages [149].

P3.1.6. Western Kentucky University (WKU, USA)

PA 10 kWth CLC unit was operated with solid fuels at the Institute
for Combustion Science and Environmental Technology (ICSET) of
Western Kentucky University (WKU) in 2012 by Cao et al. [150]. This
unit consists of a bubbling fluidized bed fuel reactor and a circulating
fluidized bed air reactor; see Fig. 10. A CuO/Al2O3 material was used
as the oxygen carrier. The unit had previously been tested in suc-
cessful operation with CH4 and syngas since 2010. Later, biomass

Pwas used as fuel [180], but co-combustion of biomass with fuel gas,
H2 or CH4, was required to maintain the system at high temperature.
The presence of CuO could induce oxygen transference by oxygen
uncoupling [59], but the presence of Al2O3 could hinder the oxygen
uncoupling capability of the oxygen carrier material [67]. No details
are given on operating the CLC unit with this oxygen carrier to indi-
cate whether CLC or CLOU was the main process in the gaseous fuel
combustion. Nevertheless, combustion of biomass was likely to take
place via iG-CLCs due to the low temperature (about 800 °C), which
supresses oxygen uncoupling [143].

P3.1.7. Ohio State University (OSU, USA)

PAs described above, the configuration where fuel and air reactors
are both fluidized beds (bubbling or high velocity) is the commonest.
However, the 2.5 kWth bench scale unit and the 25 kWth subpilot
unit constructed and tested by the group headed by Prof. Fan at Ohio
State University does not follow this scheme [9] (see Fig. 11). In this
case, the fuel reactor (reducer) was designed to be a moving bed and
the air reactor (combustorþriser) was an entrained bed. In the fuel
reactor, the oxygen carrier particles descend by gravity and the gases
produced ascend, counter-current to the solids. A non-mechanical L-
valve connects the fuel reactor and air reactor to regulate the flow of
solids between reactors, and the gas sealing between both reac-
tors. Fuel is injected in the middle of the fuel reactor. The advan-
tages of this configuration over a fluidized bed are the lower
attrition of particles, better control of the fuel residence time
and the high conversion of both the fuel and oxygen carrier. This
results in almost full coal conversion with a high purity of CO2,
eliminating the need of down-stream polishing units. Intensive
experimental work has been carried out in this experimental
unit using solid fuels, such as lignite and sub-bituminous coal,
and with synthetic particles based on iron oxide as oxygen car-
riers [53,151(cid:1)153].

PThe use of Fe-based oxygen carriers is preferred in this configura-
tion. Thus, Fe2O3 can be reduced to FeO or even Fe, while full

Pcombustion of fuel to CO2 and H2O is still achieved [2]. Thus, the oxy-
gen transport capacity is increased compared to the limited reduc-
tion of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 in a circulating fluidized bed, due to the
thermodynamic constraint in achieving complete combustion to CO2
and H2O when Fe3O4 is further reduced [181].

PNevertheless, scale-up of the process would involve overcoming
several challenges. In order to maintain non-fluidized conditions in
the moving-bed, the velocity in the reburn zone of the fuel reactor
should be kept below the minimum fluidization velocity. For a given
fuel feed, this can be achieved by increasing the cross sectional area
of the reburn zone or the oxygen carrier particle size [182]. The
higher particle size of the oxygen carrier allows ash separation in
the reducer reactor and ash entrainment through the reducer outlet,
but a very large air excess is then needed in the air reactor to entrain
solids and recirculate them to the fuel reactor. In order to keep the
power demand for fluidization in the air reactor low, the solids
inventory under fluidization should be decreased. Schwebel et al.
[182] proposed staged oxidation in the air reactor, which would be
divided into a bubbling bed feeding the riser and a subsequent mov-
ing bed. Another problem to be solved in the scale-up is the thermal
gradients formed in wide moving bed reactors and the homoge-
neous distribution of coal throughout the cross sectional area of the
reactor. Therefore, these authors proposed that the reactor was nar-
rowed at the position where coal was fed, i.e. at the middle of the
moving bed, with the purpose of further distribution of solids over
the entire surface of the reactor as the solids moved down.

P3.1.8. Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion (GIEC, China)

PA 10 kWth unit was erected by Zhao et al. at CAS Key Laboratory
of Renewable Energy at Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion;
see Fig. 12. The fuel reactor design followed a similar concept to that
of the 10 kWth unit at CUT. In this case, biomass (sawdust) gasifica-
tion using a Fe2O3/Al2O3 oxygen carrier was performed in the chemi-
looping unit for syngas production instead of combustion
cal
[154,155]. Later, a bi-metallic material based on Fe-Ni was tested in

P3.1.9. Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST, China)

PIn the last few years, two units have been constructed by the
group headed by Prof. Zhao at the State Key Laboratory of Coal Com-
bustion at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in
Wuhan, with a thermal power of 5 kWth and 50 kWth, respectively.

PThe scheme for the 5 kWth unit is shown in Fig. 13A [156]. Prelim-
inary results from the combustion of a bituminous coal with hema-
tite as the oxygen carrier were recently published and optimization
of the unit is under way.

PRecently, the design and operation of a 50 kWth CLC unit has
been reported [157]; see Fig. 13B. The air reactor is a circulating
fluidized bed in the turbulent regime in order to ensure a suffi-
ciently high solids circulation rate. However, the fuel reactor is a
bubbling fluidized bed to give a high residence time to the char
particles to be gasified. A riser connected to the top of the fuel
reactor transports the solids to a carbon stripper to separate
char particles from the oxygen carrier before solids enter the air
reactor. High CO2 capture and combustion efficiencies have been
obtained in preliminary results on coal combustion with an iron
ore, where the solids inventory in the fuel reactor was as high as
2000 kg/MWth.

P3.1.10. VTT Technical Research Centre (VTT, Finland)

PDuring 2016, a new 10(cid:1)50 kWth scale dual fluidized bed chemi-
cal
looping combustion unit was constructed by VTT Technical
Research Centre [158]. This new unit was intended for the study of
biomass combustion in CLC. The use of biomass as fuel gives rise to
negative CO2 emissions. This concept will be addressed in more
detail in Section 4.4.

PThe design of the VTT unit is shown in Fig. 14. The air reactor
is a circulating fluidized bed and the fuel reactor is a bubbling
fluidized bed. Entrained solids from the air reactor are separated
by a cyclone and the reactors are interconnected by loop seals.
The unit has no carbon stripper. A total of 16 h continuous oper-
ation have been reported to date using ilmenite as oxygen car-
rier and wood pellets as fuel [158].

P3.1.11. Upcoming CLC prototypes

PSome additional CLC units are planned to be built and operated
with solid fuels in the near future, and a brief description of these
follows.

PA dual fluidized bed system has been built at the Institute of
Combustion and Power Plant Technology (IFK) at University of Stutt-
gart to be operated in CLC mode [185(cid:1)187]. The unit consists of a
bubbling fluidized bed fuel reactor, connected to a circulating fluid-
ized bed acting as air reactor. Preliminary results were obtained in
semi-batch mode using ilmenite to burn coal at the 10 kWth scale
[186]; see Fig. 15. Thus, coal was continuously fed to the fuel reactor
but ilmenite particles remained there throughout the combustion
period, i.e. there was no circulation of solids between air and fuel
reactors. Acceptable coal conversion was achieved, while ilmenite
was able to transfer oxygen. Results from continuous operation in
this unit are expected to be in the iG-CLC mode.

PA three-tower CLC system is being developed by Japan Coal
Energy Center (JCOAL) [167]; see Fig. 16. The road map for the
project includes building 100 kWth and 1 MWth facilities by 2020,
and the scale-up of the process to 10 MW and 40(cid:1)70 MW by
2025 and 2030, respectively. The three-tower concept includes:
i) a coal reactor (CR), where coal is devolatilized and remaining
char is gasified; ii) a volatile reactor (VR) above the coal reactor,
where volatile matter is converted; and iii) an air reactor (AR) to
regenerate the oxygen carrier. This concept is similar to that
described by Proell and Hofbauer [188] and used in the 25 kWth

Fig. 17 [168,169]. The design is based on dual circulating fluidized

been developed in previous works for this purpose [69,190]. This

zation in the year 2025 [191].

3.2. Semi-industrial scale units

PIn order to acquire experience on a semi-industrial scale, two CLC
units on MWth scale have been designed, built and tested, with Als-
tom being the flagship of the technology [44]. Thus, Darmstadt Tech-
nical University in collaboration with Alstom built a 1 MWth CLC
pilot plant, while Alstom's research and development centre in
Windsor (Connecticut, USA) constructed a 3 MWth facility following
the Limestone-Based Chemical Looping (LCLTM) Process [192]. In
addition, the 12 MWth CFB boiler located at Chalmers University of
Technology in Sweden was adapted to be used as CLC unit. Thus, the
4 MWth gasifier acted as the fuel reactor while the boiler was the air
reactor [166].

P3.2.1. 1 MWth CLC unit at Darmstadt University of Technology (TUD,
Germany)

PThe 1 MWth CLC unit was designed to perform the combustion
of coal via iG-CLC with naturally occurring Fe-based materials
[42,193,194] using two interconnected circulating fluidized bed
reactors. The initial design of this pilot unit incorporated a car-
bon separation system consisting of a cyclone system and a car-
bon stripper (see Fig. 19). In an early design, a low efficiency
cyclone was used to recover mostly oxygen carrier particles
which were sent to the carbon stripper. Light char particles
escaping the low efficiency cyclone were recovered in a high effi-
ciency cyclone and then recirculated to the fuel reactor. The car-
bon stripper was designed to separate char particles recovered
by the low efficiency cyclone in the main oxygen carrier stream.
The oxygen carrier circulation rate was controlled by using a
screw conveyor attached to the loop seal [193].
In a second
design, this conveyor has been replaced by an L-valve [42]. Oper-
ational results of the pilot plant have recently been reported
using ilmenite as oxygen carrier and hard coal as fuel. Early
results confirmed that coal combustion is possible in the 1 MWth
pilot plant, but autothermal operation had not been reached
because of the low solids circulation rate used [42,159]. Either
partial combustion of coal by air in the fuel reactor or combus-
tion of propane in the air reactor is required to maintain the
operating temperature in the fuel reactor during these experi-
mental campaigns. Autothermal operation has been obtained
after some modifications. The temperature in the fuel reactor is
950 °C. For this purpose, the carbon stripper has been removed
from the CLC configuration [160]. Moreover, coarser coal par-
ticles are used compared to previous works which facilitates coal
conversion by decreasing the amount of unconverted char par-
ticles escaping from the cyclones. However, the absence of the
carbon stripper reduces the efficiency of CO2 capture. Coal and
partially-devolatilized biomass combustion has also been per-
formed with an iron ore as oxygen carrier at 900 °C [161]. CO2
capture and combustion efficiency with biomass is higher than
with coal, but returns lower results than with ilmenite, which
could be caused by lower temperature and/or differences in the
solids circulation rate.

P3.2.2. 3 MWth CLC unit at Alstom Power (USA)

PAlstom Power investigated CLC combustion of solid fuels
based on the Limestone-Based Chemical Looping (LCLTM) process
[192]. In this process, CaSO4 is the oxygen carrier but limestone
(CaCO3) is the calcium source. Limestone is fed together with
coal as in the common coal combustion process in circulating
fluidized beds with in-situ desulfurization [195]. After calcination
of CaCO3 in the fuel reactor, the CaO reacts with sulfur from coal
to form CaS, which is oxidized to CaSO4 in the air reactor.

issues affecting the development of
this technology will be

PTherefore, sulfated limestone is used as oxygen carrier, which
will be mixed together with unconverted CaO and ash from coal.
The oxygen transport capacity depends on several factors, such
as Ca/S ratio, sulfur retention or the sulfur and ash content of
coal [164].

PThe 3 MWth CLC unit consists of two interconnected circulating
fluidized bed reactors; see Fig. 20. The fuel reactor (reducer) has an
internal circulation loop. This reactor includes a so-called cactus
zone where the solids returning from the two cyclones at the outlet

Pof the fuel reactor and the solids returning from the air reactor (oxi-
dizer) are mixed. The bottom area of the cactus zone is hydraulically
connected to the air reactor and also acts as a carbon stripper. The
slower solids moving in this area cause the solids to be densely
packed.

PThe 3 MWth CLC unit was first operated in 2011 [162]. Ini-
tially, the prototype was loaded with spent ash from a circulat-
ing fluidized bed, which would have a high CaSO4 content. Next,
coal was fed together with limestone. In order to achieve steady
state, spent ash should be replaced by CaSO4 being generated in-
situ by the reaction of sulfur with added limestone. Taking into
account the design flow rates and solids inventory in the system
[164], full replacement could take about one day of operation.

PAfter achieving full integration of the system, autothermal opera-
tion performed well at about 900(cid:1)930 °C [43], with the main
observation being a carbon burnout of over 98%,
low uncon-
verted char entering the air reactor, a combustion efficiency of
about 80(cid:1)85% and low SO2 emissions [163]. Sulfur emission was
related to the CaCO3 to fuel ratio. In addition, the lower part of
the cactus zone was highly effective in segregating unconverted
char particles, and therefore high CO2 capture efficiency values
were obtained. More than 500 h of operation in the prototype
have been reported. Recently, the 3 MWth unit has been relo-
cated to the Alstom Clean Energy Lab in Bloomfield (Connecticut,
USA) [44].

P3.2.3. 4 MWth CLC boiler at Chalmers University of Technology (CUT,
Sweden)

PRecently, operation in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler at
CUT has been reported; see Fig. 21 [166]. The CFB unit is a 12 MWth
boiler for biomass combustion, in which a 2(cid:1)4 MWth gasifier was
adapted in the return loop below the cyclone for research purposes
on dual fluidized bed gasification [165]. CLC operation was per-
formed using an oxygen carrier as bed material. Thus, the gasifier
acted as the fuel reactor, while the boiler was the air reactor. Experi-
ments were carried out over 1000 h using either ilmenite or manga-
nese ore as an oxygen carrier. However, the combustion efficiency
achieved was about 60% due to segregation of char particles in the
bubbling fluidized bed. Thus, gasification products could not have the
chance to react with the oxygen carrier, as occurred with small coal
particles in a smaller unit [136]. Nevertheless, the solids mixing was
improved by increasing the fluidization velocity, thus increasing
combustion efficiency. Optimization of operating conditions and
improvement of the fuel reactor design would result in higher conver-
sion levels, which would enable the scale-up of CLC of biomass [166].

configuration used in the CLC unit, one of the main problems
encountered during operation was the existence of unconverted
compounds at the outlet of the fuel reactor, which reduce the com-
bustion efficiency, except for the case of the moving bed at OSU. As

Palso shown in Fig. 1, these unburned compounds could be found in
the form of both gaseous compounds (CO, H2, CH4, CxHy) and/or par-
tially gasified char. Gaseous compounds come from volatile matter
or gasification products. The char can either be elutriated with the
gases leaving the fuel reactor or transferred together with the oxy-
gen carrier particles to the air reactor where it is burnt, therefore
decreasing the efficiency of the CO2 capture.

PIn order to evaluate a CLC system burning solid fuels, the amount
of unburned compounds leaving the fuel reactor (both gases and
partially gasified char) and the amount of carbon in the char trans-
ferred to the air reactor should be determined. This can be done
through three performance parameters: solid fuel conversion, CO2
capture and combustion efficiency [35,145].

PThere are significant differences in the definitions used to
estimate the solid fuel conversion, CO2 capture efficiency and com-
bustion efficiency. Some of the definitions of these and other param-
eters already calculated in literature are summarized below. Fig. 22
shows how the different parameters can be calculated based on the
molar flows measured in a CLC unit.

PFuel conversion and CO2 capture efficiency are based on a carbon
balance (see Fig. 23), according to Eq. (1). In the following, carbon
loss in the ash purge stream FC,purge has been considered negligible
for the balance.

FC;sf 1⁄4 FC;char þ FC;vol 1⁄4 ðFC;FR;out (cid:1)FCO2;inÞ þ FC;AR;out þ FC;elut

þ FC;purge

ð1Þ
PIn contrast, combustion efficiencies are based on oxygen balances
(see Fig. 24). Tables containing the equations used to calculate the
main parameters have been included in Figs. 22(cid:1)24. Moreover, a
column describing the parameter at boundary conditions has been
added to provide a better understanding of the meaning of each
parameter.

PIn addition, a standardized nomenclature has been used in this
section to avoid misunderstandings. The corresponding name usu-
ally given in literature for some of these parameters has also been
included.

P4.1.1. Fuel conversion

PThe solid fuel converted in a CLC unit, both in fuel and air reac-
tors, can be estimated through several carbon balances. In all cases,
only carbon from fuel is considered and carbon in fluidizing CO2 is
not included. The following parameters are used to assess the fuel
conversion.

PSolid fuel conversion, Xsf, is usually
P4.1.1.1. Solid fuel conversion (Xsf).
defined in the literature as hsf. It is a measurement of the amount of
solid fuel converted in the CLC unit, i.e. both in the fuel reactor and
air reactor. Note that carbon not present in gaseous compounds cor-
responds to partially converted char lost by elutriation (FC,elut)
[136,145,196].

PChar conversion in

the whole CLC unit, Xchar, is usually defined in the literature as
hchar. It specifies how much of the char (FC,char) has been con-
verted in the CLC unit, as it is realistic to assume that all the car-
bon contained in the volatiles is released into the fuel reactor
gaseous stream and therefore contributes to the solid fuel
conversion.

P4.1.2. Carbon dioxide capture efficiency

PTwo different definitions can be found in literature to estimate

the amount of carbon captured.

P4.1.2.1. CO2 capture efficiency (hCC).
PCO2 capture efficiency specifies
how much of the carbon introduced with the solid fuel is captured
in gaseous form at the fuel reactor outlet

hCC

ð4Þ

PCarbon in gases exiting the fuel reactor comes from carbon con-
tained in the volatiles (mostly methane) and the carbon from the
converted char. As a result, all this carbon will be converted to cap-
tured CO2. Thus, the CO2 capture efficiency calculated depends on
the fraction of char that has been gasified [136,140]. The amount of
char being gasified in the fuel reactor (Xchar,FR) can be calculated as:

1⁄4

Xchar;FR

fixed carbon converted in FR
fixed carbon in solid fuel(cid:1)carbon in elutriated char
PNote that the char conversion in the fuel reactor (Xchar,FR) is
not the same as char conversion previously defined for the whole
CLC unit (Xchar). Note as well that the product Xchar¢Xchar,FR is the
carbon fraction in char being converted only in the fuel reactor,
mainly by steam or CO2 gasification in iG-CLC [47] or combustion
with O2 in CLOU, and designated as xchar,FR:

ð5Þ

xchar;FR

1⁄4 XcharXchar;FR

ð6Þ

PIn some works, an easy extrapolation of the CO2 capture effi-
ciency to conditions where Xsf is close to 100% was done assuming
that the char conversion rate does not depend on the degree of
char conversion [101]. The estimated CO2 capture efficiency was
represented by hCC*. This parameter assumed that the char conver-
sion would be the same with or without elutriation of unconverted
char from the fuel reactor, as temperature is the most influential
variable affecting char gasification rates [197]. Therefore, the value
of the CO2 capture can be estimated using the ultimate and proxi-
mate analysis of the coal and the char conversion obtained in the
CLC unit, according to the following expression.

where xfc is the fraction of fixed carbon in the solid fuel and xC the
fraction of carbon in the solid fuel.

P4.1.2.2. Oxide oxygen fraction (xoo).
POxide oxygen fraction, xoo, is
usually given in the literature as hOO. This parameter is defined as
the amount of oxygen used to oxidize the oxygen carrier in the air
reactor divided by the sum of the oxygen used for oxidizing both the
oxygen carrier and the char reaching the air reactor from the fuel
reactor

xoo

ð8Þ

PThe advantage of using this parameter is that only the O2 and CO2
concentration measured in the air reactor outlet is required to
calculate it; see Eq. (9). However, the real CO2 capture rate is not
calculated.

ð9Þ

PDifferences between hCC and xoo will mainly depend on the
oxygen taken to burn hydrogen in coal and the combustion effi-
ciency in the CLC unit [36,127].

P4.1.3. Combustion efficiency

PThe combustion efficiency, which is also related to the purity of
CO2 at the fuel reactor outlet, is normally evaluated by oxygen
demand.

P4.1.3.1. Total oxygen demand (VT).
PThe total oxygen demand repre-
sents the amount of oxygen needed for complete combustion of
unconverted products compared to the oxygen required to convert
the fuel fed to CO2 and H2O.
VT 1⁄4 oxygen needed to burn unconverted gases

ð10Þ

oxygen needed to burn solid fuel

PUsually, only gaseous products exiting the fuel reactor are taken
into account, because unconverted elutriated char would be sepa-
rated from the gas stream and recirculated to the fuel reactor. This
parameter gives a fast evaluation of the amount of oxygen required
in a hypothetical oxygen polishing step after the fuel reactor; see
Fig. 22. In CLC literature, this definition of oxygen demand is identi-
fied as total oxygen demand (VT) [101,138]. FCxHy represents the
gaseous hydrocarbons C2-C5 and tars.

PThe combus-
P4.1.3.2. Combustion efficiency in fuel reactor (hcomb,FR).
tion efficiency in the fuel reactor (hcomb,FR) is a measure of the gas
conversion in the fuel reactor. It is defined as the fraction of oxygen
demanded by the volatile matter and gasification products supplied
by the oxygen carrier in the fuel reactor [136]

hcomb;FR

1⁄4

oxygen transferred in FR

ð11Þ

P4.1.3.3. Oxygen demand in the fuel reactor (VFR).
PAnother definition
of oxygen demand can be found in CLC literature for when the fuel
fed is not totally converted in the fuel reactor, and it is usually desig-
nated by the symbol VOD. In this paper, it is denoted as the oxygen
demand in the fuel reactor (VFR) and is related to the combustion
efficiency in the fuel reactor (hcomb,FR). The oxygen demand in the
fuel reactor (VFR) is defined as the oxygen needed for complete com-
bustion of unconverted gaseous products compared to the oxygen
required to burn the fuel converted in the fuel reactor [36]:
VFR 1⁄4 1(cid:1)hcomb;FR

1⁄4

oxygen needed to burn unconverted gases
oxygen demanded by solid fuel converted in FR

ð12Þ

PThe values of the two oxygen demand parameters are different,
as VFR is normally larger than VT for similar experimental condi-
tions. The oxygen demand in the fuel reactor (VFR) is more affected
by the degree of solid fuel conversion reached as the denominator
takes as reference the effective fuel processed in the fuel reactor.
The effective solid fuel may be less than the fuel fed, due to the
losses from the unconverted char which may be elutriated (Fc,elut) or
transferred to the air reactor, where it is burned to CO2 (Fc,AR,out).
The denominator in VT does not depend on the fraction of char
converted and, therefore, the total oxygen demand could be more
intuitive, as it gives a more direct estimation of the amount of
oxygen needed to reach complete combustion compared to the stoi-
chiometric amount in an oxy-fuel combustion process. Thus, both
definitions of the oxygen demand are linked by the amount of car-
bon in the char that is not converted in the fuel reactor (elutriated or
transferred to the air reactor).

4.2. Variables affecting the performance of the iG-CLC unit

PA comprehensive review was made to collect the parameters
evaluating the combustion performance in the CLC units presented
in Section 3. Table 4 gathers the main results obtained for units

Poperating under iG-CLC mode and Table 5 compiles results obtained
under CLOU conditions. Most of the results in Table 4 are based on
Fe-based oxygen carriers, as they are the most commonly chosen for
iG-CLC [7]. In this selection, particular attention was paid to the per-
formance parameters previously mentioned, i.e. solid fuel conver-
sion, CO2 capture efficiency and oxygen demand. If they have been
provided, Tables 4 and 5 incorporate their experimental values and
the operating conditions under which they were obtained.

PAs schematized in Fig. 25, the main operating conditions influ-
encing CO2 capture efficiency and oxygen demand are the type of
oxygen carrier chosen, the temperature in the fuel reactor, the rate
at which the oxygen carrier circulates between reactors and the
amount of solids present in the fuel reactor, the type of solid fuel
used together with its feeding rate, and the presence of a carbon
stripper. In the following sections, the most relevant information
obtained in operating CLC units pertaining to the effect of these vari-
ables on the solid fuel conversion, the CO2 capture efficiency and
oxygen demand will be summarized.

P4.2.1. Relevance of the oxygen carrier

PThe reactivity of the oxygen carrier both during reduction by the
solid fuel and oxidation in air is one of the most important aspects to
be taken into account when selecting a material for use in the iG-
CLC process. The reactivity of the oxygen carrier affects the oxygen
demand and, to some extent, the CO2 capture efficiency. Fig. 26A
and B plots most of the results summarized in Table 4 for oxygen
carriers based on Ni, Fe and Cu, as well as for CaSO4.

PAn oxygen carrier with high reactivity towards H2, CO and CH4
will reduce the amount of unburned gaseous products escaping
from the fuel reactor and, therefore, the oxygen demand. Elemental
studies based on density functional theory calculations (DFT) can be
found in literature [203(cid:1)207]. They analyze some aspects regarding
the theoretical reactivity of oxygen carriers, such as the effect of
metal oxide or the relevance of dopants addition.

PRegarding CO2 capture efficiency, there are other variables affect-
ing the CO2 capture reached besides the type of oxygen carrier. This
fact makes it difficult to find clear trends based on the type of oxygen
carrier used, see Fig. 26A. Nevertheless, the two properties of the
oxygen carrier that can affect CO2 capture efficiency are the reactiv-
ity [61] and capacity to transport oxygen. If the oxygen carrier
presents high reactivity to H2, the inhibiting effect of this gas on
steam gasification of char would be reduced and the char gasification
rate would be faster [208]. This would result in greater char conver-
sion in the fuel reactor and, therefore, higher CO2 capture efficiency.
In addition, the oxygen transport capacity of the oxygen carrier, ROC,
can affect CO2 capture because the solids circulation rate required
between fuel and air reactors depends on the ROC value [209]. Thus,
if an oxygen carrier with a high ROC value is used, CO2 capture would
be increased by the reduced flow of circulating solids required
between the fuel and air reactor [145].

PThe oxygen carriers used in iG-CLC are mainly based on oxides of
Ni, Fe and Mn, although the use of CaSO4 as an oxygen carrier has
been also tested.

P4.2.1.1. Ni-based oxygen carriers.
PNi-based oxygen carriers show
high reactivity. CO2 capture efficiencies are high, as shown in
Fig. 26A. In the figure, the yellow area covers all the cases in which
high CO2 capture efficiency was reached. Most of the experiments
performed using NiO oxygen carriers fall into this area, except those
using anthracite as fuel. However, there are some disadvantages in
their use with solid fuels. First, they are easily poisoned by coals
with high sulfur content [125,175,176]. Second, they are toxic and
expensive compared to other metal oxides, and therefore the use of
Ni is not advisable for solid fuels.

P4.2.1.2. Fe-based oxygen carriers.
PMost of the Fe-based oxygen car-
riers investigated until now are mainly minerals or industrial resi-
dues; as can also be seen in Fig. 26A, Fe-based materials have
received most of the attention in the recent literature, especially
ilmenite, a low-cost mineral (FeTiO3). Ilmenite has excellent recycla-
bility for the Fe2TiO5-FeTiO3 redox pair and a relatively high oxygen
transport capacity (ROC 1⁄4 5 wt.% for pure ilmenite) [210]. A priori, it
presents good fluidization behavior and excellent physical stability.
It shows a gain in the reactivity with the redox cycles until an acti-
vated state is reached [96,136] and has demonstrated good reactivity
to syngas components, i.e. H2 and CO [211]. However, under some
circumstances, e.g. high conversion during the reduction stage, Fe is
found to migrate towards the outer surface of the particle, where a
Fe-enriched shell is formed [96,97]. Migrated Fe can be lost from the
surface under the conditions existing in a circulating fluidized bed
[95]. This fact means that both the crushing strength of particles and
the oxygen transport capacity decrease with operating time [97].
However, ilmenite's stability was maintained when variation in
the conversion of solids was limited to low values [136]. Typical
reported values of total oxygen demand (VT) operating with ilmen-
ite and bituminous coal vary between 5(cid:1)15% [120,136,145]. Some
improvement in the performance of the iG-CLC was observed after
adding CaCO3 to ilmenite in a 10 kWth CLC unit [114]. Thus, the oxy-
gen demand decreased at 950 °C due to the catalytic effect of lime
on the water-gas shift reaction. This led to more highly reactive H2
being produced to the detriment of the lower reactive CO with lime-
stone addition. However, no effect was shown at 1000 °C. In any
case, the CO2 capture was improved due to an increase in the char
gasification rate.

PIn addition to ilmenite, iron ore has been widely used to burn coal
[100,101,129,133,156,161], biomass [127,139,141] or sewage sludge
[132,134] in several facilities ranging from 0.5 to 1000 kWth. More-
over, it was used in the first iG-CLC operation under pressure [135].
As can be observed in Fig. 26B, lower values of VT than those found
for ilmenite have been reported using highly reactive Fe-based oxy-
gen carriers, namely an iron ore and a bauxite waste [100,101,140].
These materials show higher reactivity to gasification products
than ilmenite [98,212], but the oxygen transport capacity is lower
when Fe2O3 reduction is limited to Fe3O4 (ROC 1⁄4 3.3 wt% for pure
hematite) due to thermodynamic restrictions enabling complete
combustion of H2 and CO in a fluidized bed reactor [181,213]. In
this case, faster solids circulation was required to increase the com-
bustion efficiency, which decreased the CO2 capture rate by 1(cid:1)4
percentage points compared to the use of ilmenite [100] (see
Fig. 26A). To maintain the CO2 capture rate close to 100%, the
design and operating conditions of the carbon separation system
must be optimized.

PWith iron ore as an oxygen carrier, the combustion efficiency of
biomass or sewage sludge was lower than that observed for coal
when the fuel reactor was a fluidized bed [139], but the opposite
was found with a spouted bed as the fuel reactor [132]. This fact
could be due to the different behavior of combustion of volatile mat-
ter and gasification products. From these results, it can be inferred
that the combustion of volatile matter is improved when a spouted
bed is used as the fuel reactor. In contrast, gasification products
could be easily converted in a fluidized bed. Therefore, the final
result obtained for each reactor type should be evaluated individu-
ally. An evaluation of the effect on CLC of the conversion of the vola-
tile matter and gasification products will be shown in Section 5.

PIn order to improve the performance of natural hematite, some
studies have focused on modifying the original iron ore. Fundamen-
tal studies on the development of oxygen carriers based on Na-, K-
or Ca-modified Fe-based materials showed that the presence of
these compounds greatly boosted the oxygen carrier reactivity and
char conversion rate [214(cid:1)222]. Thus, the use of a K-modified iron
ore improved the CO2 capture and combustion efficiency burning

Pcoal in a 1 kWth CLC unit [130]. The addition of K increased the reac-
tivity of iron ore, and the catalytic effect of K on char conversion was
suggested as a reason for the improved performance of this material
in iG-CLC process. This effect can be also observed in Fig. 26A. The
experiments performed with an iron ore and a high sodium coal as
fuel lie under the yellow area, with similar CO2 capture efficiencies
to those obtained with NiO-based materials, due to the catalytic
effect of Na on char gasification [133].

PIn contrast to the use of Fe-based materials in a fluidized bed
reactor, almost full fuel combustion has been found when a Fe-based
oxygen carrier was used in a counter-current moving bed reactor,
even if Fe2O3 was reduced to metallic Fe [151(cid:1)153]. In this case,
thermodynamic restrictions to allow complete conversion of H2 and
CO to H2O and CO2 are overcome because Fe2O3 is put in contact
with exiting gases in the counter-current mode [151]. However,
higher particle size is required to prevent fluidization in the moving
bed reactor, which demands large quantities of air to transport par-
ticles in the L-valve and air reactor riser [53].

PManganese ores are also low-cost

materials being tested as oxygen carriers in iG-CLC of solid fuels.
Generally, the Mn3O4/MnO redox system is used in iG-CLC mode,
which possesses an oxygen transport capacity of ROC 1⁄4 7 wt%. Experi-
ments in a 10 kWth unit with low-volatile fuels, such as petcoke and
wood char, showed that manganese ores presented increased char
gasification compared to ilmenite, which resulted in increased CO2
capture efficiency [54,115]. Recently, mixtures of ilmenite and man-
ganese minerals were tested in the 100 kWth unit at CUT [122] using
two bituminous coals and wood char. Results indicate that the addi-
tion of small amounts of manganese ore (up to 8%) to ilmenite could
almost halve the amount of unconverted gas, while the fuel conver-
sion in the fuel reactor was barely affected. On one hand, the increase
observed in combustion efficiency was related to the higher reactiv-
ity of manganese ores with H2 and CO, compared to ilmenite
[93,102]. On the other hand, the increase in the char gasification rate
was attributed not only to the higher reactivity of the manganese ore
to syngas, but also to the catalytic effect on char gasification of Na
and K released by the manganese ore and deposited on the char sur-
face [105]. Nevertheless, Na and K is lost during CLC operation, which
means that eventually the gasification rate with manganese ores
would be similar to that observed with ilmenite after a few hours of
operation [103]. However, one manganese ore which maintains a rel-
atively high char conversion rate after several redox cycles has been
identified [103]. No other reasons have been found for the increase
of the char conversion rate [223(cid:1)225] and this effect should be

Panalyzed in more detail. The main problems of using manganese ores
in CLC units concerned the high fraction of fines generated, which
caused operational problems and decreased the life-time of the
material [226]. Recently some attrition resistant manganese ores
have been found [54,102,226] which encourages further research on
the use of this kind of low cost material.

P4.2.1.4. CaSO4 as oxygen carrier.
PThe use of anhydrite (CaSO4) as an
oxygen carrier has received significant attention due to its high oxy-
gen transport capacity (ROC 1⁄4 47 wt%) compared to Fe or Mn-based
materials [7,227,228]. This property benefits the CO2 capture rate, as
slower solids circulation between fuel and air reactors would be
required [145,209]. However, several problems have been detected
from lab-scale experiments, and operation in a CLC unit has not
been carried out. These problems are related to the low reactivity of
anhydrite ore [106,109,229] and the release of sulfur compounds
during the redox process between CaSO4 and CaS [107,108,110,230].
Some solutions have been proposed to avoid sulfur release, including
the following: (1) to have incomplete combustion in the CLC unit,
which hinders sulfur release in the fuel reactor [231]; full combus-
tion would be reached in another CLC unit downstream from the
fuel reactor, based on a metal oxide material [232]; (2) suppression
of side reactions involved in sulfur release by adding hematite to
anhydrite [233(cid:1)237]; (3) addition of Ca-based sorbents, i.e. CaO or
CaCO3, as desulfurization sorbents [238].

PDespite anhydrite not having been tested in a CLC unit burning
coal, the use of CaSO4 as an oxygen carrier has been implemented
via the Alstom’s Limestone-based Chemical Looping (LCLTM) process
[192] at the 3 MWth scale CLC unit [163]. In this case, the CaSO4 oxy-
gen carrier is generated in situ by the reaction of limestone with sul-
fur in coal; thus, in situ desulfurization is also carried out. In this
way, problems associated with sulfur emission are avoided. In addi-
tion, CaSO4 formed in the sulfation of limestone is more reactive
than anhydrite ore and in the order of magnitude of Fe-based oxygen
carriers [111]. A similar performance would be expected in the
LCLTM process and iG-CLC with iron minerals.

P4.2.1.5. Synthetic oxygen carriers.
PAlthough low cost materials are
normally preferred in solid fuel CLC, the use of synthetic materials
may benefit some cases. The main reason for their development is
their high reactivity together with other significant characteristics.
In fact, promising results have been found for Fe-Mn [89], Mn-Si-Ti
[239] and Cu [149] in the 0.5 kWth, 10 kWth and 25 kWth CLC units at
ICB-CSIC, CUT and TUHH, respectively. Especially interesting are the

P4.2.2. Relevance of the temperature in the fuel reactor

PThe effect of the fuel reactor temperature on the performance of
the iG-CLC process has been intensively evaluated. As previously
shown in Fig. 26, the fuel reactor temperature can affect both the
final CO2 capture efficiency and the oxygen demand. Regardless of
the type of oxygen carrier used, it is clear from Fig. 26A that an
increase in the fuel reactor temperature increases CO2 capture and
reduces oxygen demand as the fuel reactor temperature increases.

PIt must be remembered that high temperatures enhance char
gasification in the fuel reactor, which is the limiting step in the iG-
CLC process. Higher char gasification rates lead to greater char con-
version in the fuel reactor and less char reaching the air reactor,
therefore higher CO2 capture efficiencies are obtained. Higher tem-
peratures also favor the reactivity of the oxygen carrier to the gas-
eous fuels released in coal gasification, but the effect of temperature
on the reactivity of the oxygen carrier is not as significant as the
increase in the char gasification rate (Fig. 26B), even if highly reac-
tive oxygen carriers are used. As an example, in the combustion of
bituminous coal with ilmenite, the activation energy for the reaction

Pof ilmenite with H2, CO and CH4 in the temperature range appropri-
ate for iG-CLC is between 65(cid:1)135 kJ/mol [211], while the activation
energy for steam gasification of bituminous char in the same tem-
perature range is about 160 kJ/mol [177].

PIn order to reduce the amount of non-gasified char reaching the
air reactor and increasing CO2 capture efficiency, the experimental
results obtained until now point to high temperatures around
1000 °C in the fuel reactor for coal [118,129,136,140,145,156]. This
conclusion also applies to using a moving bed design as fuel reac-
tor, where there is a temperature profile along the reactor. Due to
the heat loss, the temperature at the bottom and top area is lower
than in the middle section [241]. In the experiments performed
with metallurgical coke as fuel and iron oxide as the oxygen car-
rier, it was observed that temperature was the most significant
factor affecting carbon conversion. The conversion of the metallur-
gical coke increased faster in the middle section where the tem-
perature was also the highest in the temperature profile. An
increase in carbon conversion from 30% to 72% was observed when
the temperature increased from 960 to 1010 °C [241].

P4.2.3. Relevance of the solids circulation rate

PIn a CLC system, the solids circulation rate between fuel and air
reactors should be high enough to ensure that both the oxygen
needed for combustion and the heat needed to maintain the heat
balance are transferred between reactors [209]. The effect of the sol-
ids circulation rate on the CO2 capture and combustion efficiency is
usually evaluated through the oxygen carrier to fuel ratio, f [242].
This parameter is defined as the molar ratio between the oxygen
available in the circulating oxygen carrier and the stoichiometric
oxygen required to burn the fuel. For correct calculation of the f
parameter, the oxygen carrier is assumed to be completely oxidized
in the air reactor. An oxygen carrier to fuel ratio value of f 1⁄4 1 means
that the stoichiometric oxygen can be supplied by the oxygen car-
rier, while if f > 1 an excess of oxygen would be transferred from
the air to the fuel reactor. Note that the variation of solid conversion
between the air and fuel reactor decreases as the f parameter
increases [243], which will be important for the following discus-
sion. In Fig. 27A, it can be observed that in the units without a carbon
stripper, an increase in the solids circulation rate leads to a decrease
in the CO2 capture efficiency [138,140]. Faster solids circulation
means shorter residence times in the fuel reactor and this directly
affects char gasification. The shorter the residence time, the lower
the char conversion and therefore, lower CO2 capture efficiencies. In
the CLC units with a carbon separation system (under the grey area
in Fig. 27A), the CO2 capture values were usually close to 100%. In
this case, the solids circulation rate on the CO2 capture was less rele-
vant because the presence of the carbon stripper increased the resi-
dence time of char particles in the fuel reactor. This effect has also
been observed in the 10 kWth CLC unit developed at IFPEN under
experiments with a bituminous coal [147].

PThe 50 kWth CLC unit at ICB-CSIC and the 100 kWth CLC unit at
CUT were designed to allow for independent control of the global
solids circulation rate and solids inventory in the fuel reactor. In
experiments using ilmenite and bituminous coals at CUT, an
increase in the flow in the circulation riser led to a decrease in
the residence time and a decrease in CO2 capture was observed
[123,145]. Nevertheless, this effect was barely noticeable when
the carbon separation system was highly efficient in separating
char particles, thus avoiding unconverted char particles from
entering the air reactor [120], and CO2 capture rates were always
close to 100%.

PFig. 27B plots the results for oxygen demand obtained in studies
with different oxygen carriers when the value of the solids circula-
tion rate was varied, while the fuel reactor temperature was main-
tained stable for each experimental series. The main effect is
probably due to the variation of the average reactivity of solids in

Pthe fuel reactor, which depends on the variation of solids conversion
[209].

PSome qualitative differences can be found in Fig. 27B in
the results obtained from different CLC units, depending on
the operating conditions.
In some cases, the variation of the
solids circulation rate barely affected the total oxygen demand
[121,123,138,140]. In these cases, the variation of the solids con-
version was low either because f was high, e.g. f > 2.5 in the
100 kWth at CUT [120] or the fuel conversion was not complete, e.
g. in the 0.5 kWth CLC at ICB-CSIC [138,140]. Under such condi-
tions, the variation of the average reactivity of solids in the fuel
reactor is only slightly affected by the solids circulation rate
[209], and it is logical to find that this parameter has little effect
on the combustion efficiency [61]. In other cases, an increase in
the solids circulation rate resulted in a significant decrease of the
total oxygen demand in experiments performed in the 50 kWth
CLC unit at ICB-CSIC [145], when the f ratio was maintained
between 1 and 1.5, meaning that the variation in solids conver-
sion was higher than in the other cases. These conditions increase
the average reactivity [177], which eventually affects combustion
efficiency.

PAs a conclusion from the results obtained in different units, a f
value in the 2(cid:1)4 interval is recommended in order to boost combus-
tion efficiency, but without a detrimental effect on the CO2 capture
[244].

P4.2.4. Relevance of the specific solids inventory in the fuel reactor

PThe solids inventory present in the fuel reactor is also an impor-
tant variable to be considered in reaching low values of oxygen
demand [61]. Fig. 28 shows the effect of the solids inventory on CO2
capture efficiency and oxygen demand found in studies compiled in
Table 4.

PExperiments performed using ilmenite as an oxygen carrier and
bituminous coal as fuel in the 50 kWth unit at ICB-CSIC and 100 kWth
unit at CUT showed that the inventory in the fuel reactor has a rele-
vant impact on the combustion efficiency or oxygen demand
[121,123,145]. In general, the oxygen demand decreased as the sol-
ids inventory in the fuel reactor increased from 350 to 700 kg/MWth.
Theoretical results showed that a further increase would have a
lower effect on the combustion efficiency, and a solids inventory
higher than 1000 kg/MWth would be not recommended, due to the
resulting high pressure drop in the fuel reactor [244,245]. However,
the CO2 capture efficiency in Fig. 28A was less dependent on the
amount of oxygen carrier in the fuel reactor, since the char recircu-
lated from the carbon stripper. Thus, the average residence time of
solids in the fuel reactor was mainly affected by the presence of the
carbon stripper rather than the amount of solids in the fuel reactor.
This scenario is plausible when the carbon stripper is highly efficient
[120], but CO2 capture will increase with the solids inventory when
the efficiency of the carbon stripper separating char particles is low,
e.g. <90% [61].

P4.2.5. Effect of the H2O/CO2 ratio

PThe recirculation of part of the CO2 from the flue gases to be used
as a fluidizing/gasifying agent in the fuel reactor would be of interest
to minimize steam generation and the energy costs associated with
it; see Fig. 1. The effect of the composition of the gasifying agent on
the performance of the iG-CLC process is summarized in Fig. 29. At
ICB-CSIC, different H2O/CO2 ratios in the gasifying agent were fed
into the fuel reactor in a 0.5 kWth CLC unit [137]. In experiments
with ilmenite and different types of coal, the CO2 capture efficiency
increased with a higher H2O fraction in the feeding flow, because the
gasification rate was higher using steam rather than CO2 as a gasify-
ing agent under similar experimental conditions, see Fig. 29A. This
conclusion was also reached in experiments in the 10 kWth CLC at

PIFPEN with a bituminous coal [147], where it was found that CO2 was
less effective than steam during char gasification.

PNevertheless, the extent of the difference in the char gasifica-
tion rate when steam or CO2 is used depends on the type of fuel
[137]. Thus, for highly reactive coals such as lignite, the differen-
ces in CO2 capture using either H2O or CO2 as a gasifying agent
did not significantly affect the performance of the process and
thus CO2 could be used to replace steam, with the corresponding
energy savings from stream production. Similar conclusions were
reached in the two-stage bubbling fluidized bed fuel reactor at
TUHH.
In experiments using ilmenite and lignite, the results
obtained from changing the fluidization medium from H2O to

PCO2 indicate that the gasification is not the conversion limiting
step [148].

PIn addition, the oxygen demand in Fig. 29B seems to be hardly
affected by the composition of the gasification agent [137]. When
steam is used as a gasifying agent, H2 and CO are produced as gasifi-
cation products, while CO is the only product when CO2 is used as
gasifying agent. Even when ilmenite reacts faster with H2 than with
CO, the high solids inventory in the fuel reactor used in the experi-
ments shown in Fig. 29B [137] meant that no significant changes in
the oxygen demand were observed when the gasification products
were enriched in H2 or CO. Moreover, the reason for incomplete
combustion of gaseous products in the 0.5 kWth CLC unit used at
ICB-CSIC was poor contact between the oxygen carrier and volatiles.

ite [119,122,123,146]; Fe2O3-based [100,140].

PTherefore, the composition of the gasification products (H2 or
CO-enriched) was not important for the final oxygen demand
reached in this unit with a bubbling FR.

P4.2.6. Effect of the coal

PThe coal rank clearly influences CO2 capture efficiency, as can be
observed by comparing plots shown in Fig. 26A. Dedicated studies
on the feasibility of using different types of coal in iG-CLC have been
carried out in a 0.5 kWth CLC unit at ICB-CSIC with ilmenite and iron
ore as an oxygen carrier [101,137] and anthracite, bituminous coals
of varying volatile content, and lignite as fuels. They observed
greater CO2 capture efficiencies for the coals with a faster char

Pgasification rate and higher volatile content, since the carbon from
the volatiles is always captured in the fuel reactor. This effect was
especially noticeable with lignite. In the case of coals with a slow
gasification rate, such as anthracite, a highly efficient carbon stripper
would be needed to separate unconverted char particles and send
them back to the fuel reactor in order to obtain adequate CO2 cap-
ture efficiencies.

PIn addition, lower values of oxygen demand were found for the
coals with a faster char gasification rate and lower volatile content,
since the oxygen demand in the 0.5 kWth unit is limited by the low
conversion of volatile matter [136]. When the combustion efficiency
of the volatiles from the different types of coal was calculated, it was

Pfuel under the yellow area in Fig. 26A are those with a higher content
of volatiles, i.e. lignite, biomass and sewage sludge. The blue area in
Fig. 26A shows the experiments with the lowest CO2 capture effi-
ciencies, most of which were performed with anthracite as fuel. The
effect of the coal rank on the oxygen demand can also be corrobo-
rated from Fig. 26B. The lowest values in the figure were obtained in
experiments with anthracite or petcoke.

PThe coal rank was also taken into account when using a moving
bed as fuel reactor. In coals with a high volatile content, a co-current
flow pattern for gas and solids is preferred to counter-current, to
facilitate the full conversion of coal through improved conversion of
volatile matter [241].

P4.2.7. Effect of pressure

PThere are few studies to date addressing the effect on CLC perfor-
mance of operating at pressures higher than atmospheric. The most
significant study was presented by Xiao et al. [135] from Southeast
University. These authors performed a study in a CLC unit consisting
of two fluidized bed reactors operating in the fast/turbulent fluidiza-
tion regime, which improved the gas-solid contact; see Fig. 6. They
used bituminous coal as fuel and an iron ore as the oxygen carrier
and the operating temperature in fuel and air reactors were set to
950 and 970 °C, respectively. A decrease in the amount of uncon-
verted gases (CO, H2 and CH4) was observed when the pressure was
increased from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa. This fact was attributed to the
enhancement of reduction reactions of the oxygen carrier with pres-
sure, which was previously observed by the same authors in experi-
ments in a batch fixed bed reactor [246,247]. The combustion
efficiency increased from 93.5% to 98% and the CO2 capture effi-
ciency rose from 82.9% to 86.8% when pressure was increased from
0.1 to 0.5 MPa [135]. The fact that less H2 and CO were present in
the fuel reactor atmosphere reduced char gasification inhibition
and the char gasification rate increased, boosting CO2 capture. No
agglomeration or changes in the morphology or reactivity of the
oxygen carrier were observed, although its specific surface area and
the pore volume improved slightly. This experiment demonstrated
the advantages that operation at high pressures could bring to the
CLC process. The pressurized CLC unit operated for 19 h with coal
feeding and 13.5 h at stable operation with a thermal power of
50 kWth. Nevertheless, more work is needed to solve the challenges
arising from operating at high pressures before the process can be
scaled up.

P4.2.8. Effect of the carbon stripper

PAs mentioned before, high temperatures in the fuel reactor
(1000 °C) can increase the CO2 capture efficiency obtained in the iG-
CLC unit. In addition, the amount of non-gasified char reaching the
air reactor and then decreasing the CO2 capture efficiency can be fur-
ther reduced by fitting a carbon stripper between the fuel and air
reactors [48]. An efficient carbon stripper can separate almost all the
ungasified char from the oxygen carrier before reaching the air reac-
tor and send it back to the fuel reactor, thus obtaining high CO2 cap-
ture [60]. This effect is observed in Fig. 26A. Most of the results
obtained in CLC units with a carbon stripper fall under the yellow
area covering the results with the highest CO2 capture efficiencies.
Several of the CLC units described in the previous sections of this
paper incorporate a carbon stripper between the fuel and air reac-
tors. Fig. 30 presents a summary of the different designs in operating
CLC units. Nevertheless, only a few studies in the literature analyze
the performance of the carbon stripper. It must be realized that the
design and operating conditions of the carbon stripper heavily influ-
ence the efficiency of char separation, and hence the CO2 capture
achieved.

PIn the 10 kWth unit at CUT, the carbon stripper was integrated
into the fuel reactor (Fig. 30A) [36]. A similar design was used for the
recently built 10 kWth unit at GIEC [154,155]. At the 1 MWth unit at

ciency (hCC) and (B) the combustion efficiency in the fuel reactor (hcomb,FR) and the
oxygen demand (VT). Adapted from Ref. [137].

Pconcluded that it depended on the composition of the released vola-
tiles, the highest being obtained for those from bituminous coal
(58(cid:1)61% efficiency) and the lowest from anthracite (42%).

PThe effect of the coal rank on CO2 capture efficiency and/or oxy-
gen demand has been also noted in other studies at CUT [124].
Mexican petroleum coke and a bituminous coal were used in the
100 kWth CLC unit with ilmenite as an oxygen carrier. Lower values
of oxygen demand were found in experiments with petroleum coke
with a lower volatile content.

PImpurities present in the coal can also affect performance in an
iG-CLC unit. Recently, Ge et al. [133] evaluated the CO2 capture effi-
ciency reached in experiments with hematite and four coals with
different volatile content (three bituminous coals and one anthra-
cite). One of the bituminous coals, known as ZD, contained very high
Na content (7.5%). The carbon capture efficiency values obtained fol-
lowed the same order as the volatile content, except for ZD bitumi-
nous coal. Although the volatile content in ZD was lower than in the
other bituminous coals, it returned the highest CO2 capture effi-
ciency, which was attributed to the catalytic effect of Na on char gas-
ification.

PFig. 26A and B show the tendencies observed in the results gath-
ered in Table 4. As can be seen, except for NiO-based oxygen carriers,
or cases where a carbon stripper is included in the unit, the types of

PTUD, the carbon stripper consisted of a single chamber where char
was separated from the oxygen carrier (Fig. 30B) [43]. Studies per-
formed at TUHH [49] simulated the carbon stripping process using
the carbon stripper as a fluidized bed. The influence of different
operating parameters on the performance of char and oxygen carrier
separation was analyzed. However, possible reactions taking place
in the carbon stripper were not included in the simulation [120], but
the velocity of the fluidizing gas in the carbon stripper was indicated
as one of the main parameters influencing the carbon stripper opera-
tion and, therefore, the improvement in CO2 capture efficiency. A
two-chamber carbon stripper was tested at ICB-CSIC (Fig. 30C)
[144]. Operating conditions in the carbon stripper were evaluated
experimentally. The gas velocity was modified and maintained suffi-
ciently low to avoid elutriation of oxygen carrier particles in experi-
ments carried out in the 50 kWth CLC unit at ICB-CSIC [145]. Clearly,
CO2 capture was improved by increasing the gas velocity due to
more char being entrained from the bed. However, at the highest
velocity (0.7 m/s), no relevant improvement was observed compared
to results obtained at 0.5 m/s. A two-chamber carbon stripper simi-
lar to that at ICB-CSIC was implemented at the newly designed
50 kWth CLC unit at HUST [157].

PA highly efficient carbon stripper was incorporated in the
100 kWth unit at CUT (Fig. 30D) [123]. The design featured a four
chambered bubbling fluidized bed, with the aim of forcing the solids
to move upward and downward between chambers. Sufficient flu-
idization and flow of solids was observed in a cold flow model [248].
This design allows a very low fraction of unconverted char to reach
the air reactor, thus achieving CO2 capture values close to 100% with
different fuels and oxygen carriers [100,121(cid:1)124]. From the experi-
mental results obtained in the 100 kWth unit, the efficiency of the
carbon stripper was estimated using theoretical simulations [120].
An average value for the carbon stripper efficiency was estimated at
99.4% for the unit.

PMoreover, the carbon stripper is an additional reactor in
which char gasification can take place. The relevance of char gas-
ification in the carbon stripper was evaluated in the 100 kWth
unit at CUT using ilmenite and a bituminous coal as fuel [123].
For this purpose, the steam supplied as the fluidizing agent in
the carbon stripper was replaced with the same volumetric flow
of nitrogen. Thus, the char separation efficiency of the carbon
stripper would not be modified, but gasification of char particles
cannot take place. According to the results reported, the CO2
capture efficiency decreased from around 98.5 to 95.5%. There-
fore, improvement in CO2 capture efficiency due to char gasifica-
tion in the carbon stripper was estimated to be 3 percentage
points. By modeling the carbon stripper, it was found that the
extent of char gasification in the carbon stripper was low,
because the concentration of char in the reactor was low [244].
In fact, this is the purpose of the carbon stripper: to separate
char from the oxygen carrier, so the solids will be oxygen carrier
concentrated. A four-chambered carbon stripper was also used at
Tsinghua University (China) where a cold flow model of a
70 kWth chemical looping combustor was used to analyze factors
affecting the performance of the carbon stripper, such as gas
velocity in the carbon stripper, the solids circulation rate and the
inner structure of the carbon stripper [50]. The carbon stripper
was designed as a turbulent fluidized bed in its lower part. The
upper part was designed with the aim of increasing the gas
velocity by a factor of 20 through a decrease in the sectional
area. The experiments confirmed that the velocity of the gas
used to fluidize the carbon stripper bed influenced the efficiency
of carbon separation. Higher velocities improved the separation.
The effect of decreasing the residence time of the solids in the
fuel reactor by changing the solids circulation flow in the carbon
stripper was also checked, and it was observed that lower resi-
dence times led to lower separation efficiency. It was suggested

Pthat the use of a carbon stripper is especially interesting for solid
fuels with low reactivity.

PThe 3 MWth CLC unit from Alstom also incorporates a carbon
stripper, but in this case, the lower part of the cactus zone separated
unconverted char particles (Fig. 30E) [43].

PFinally, some new concepts for carbon stripper design have
appeared recently at Tsinghua University (TU) (Fig. 30F and G): the
annular carbon stripper [249] and the riser-based carbon stripper
[51]. The typical range for gas velocities in the carbon stripper is
0.15(cid:1)0.4 m/s [51]. Carbon strippers commonly operate in the bub-
bling or turbulent fluidization regime. Under these conditions, the
separation of char from oxygen carrier particles takes place in the
freeboard zone above the bed surface. Taking this into account and
in order to maximize separation, a riser-based carbon stripper was
proposed [51]. Using a cold flow model, it was observed that high
separation efficiencies could be achieved when the gas velocity in
the riser rose to an optimum value. A further rise in gas velocity did
not lead to large increases in separation efficiencies. Moreover, the
separation efficiency decreased as the solids mixture feeding rate
increased.

PIn any case, two strategies can be considered in order to separate
unconverted char from oxygen carrier particles: a dedicated carbon
stripper and in-built carbon-stripper. For either of these, the particle
size of the oxygen carrier and coal must be carefully selected in
order to show sufficiently different fluid dynamic properties for sep-
aration purposes. The particle size of the solid fuel should be large
enough for efficient recovery by the cyclone system, and at the same
time small enough to be successfully separated from oxygen carrier
particles. Concerning char separation, the external carbon stripper
enables specific control of the operating conditions without modify-
ing the existing conditions in the fuel reactor. In this respect, the in-
built carbon stripper in the fuel reactor would be less flexible,
although it avoids adding another piece of equipment.

P4.2.9. Effect of the fuel reactor design

PTable 6 summarizes the characteristics of the main operating
units. Some of the first CLC units designed to burn solid fuels used a
bubbling fluidized bed or a spouted bed as fuel reactor. However,
the latter design had no particular advantage, as although the
spouted bed could minimize the losses of material due to elutriation,
the gas-solid contact was inferior to a bubbling fluidized bed. This
was experimentally observed in the 1(cid:1)10 kWth CLC units at SU
which used a spouted bed as fuel reactor [39,126].

PIn view of the configurations chosen in the iG-CLC units burning
solid fuels currently under operation, the most common trend is to
use two interconnected circulating fluidized beds as fuel and air
reactors. The use of a circulating fluidized bed as fuel reactor makes
operation of the unit more flexible than when a bubbling fluidized
bed is used. The solids circulation rate and mass inventory in the
fuel reactor can be more easily regulated and this can result in better
control of combustion conditions. This is shown when results
obtained in the 0.5 kWth (bubbling fuel reactor) and 50 kWth (circu-
lating fuel reactor) CLC units at ICB-CSIC are compared for the same
oxygen carrier and coal [251]. Improved conversion of volatile mat-
ter was observed in the dilute region above the dense bed in the cir-
culating fuel reactor of the 50 kWth unit, which operated in the
turbulent fluidization regime. [144].

PAt CUT, the overall performance in the 100 kWth unit (high veloc-
ity fuel reactor) was higher than in the 10 kWth unit (bubbling fuel
reactor), as can be seen in Table 6. Both gas and solid fuel conversion
were much higher in the larger unit. Using ilmenite and bituminous
Colombian coal, CO2 capture efficiencies above 99% and oxygen
demands (VFR) around 16% were reached in the 100 kWth unit in the
temperature range 940(cid:1)980 °C [123], while the values obtained in
the 10 kWth unit were 82(cid:1)96% and 20%, respectively, in experiments
with South African bituminous coal [36]. The improvement in the

PCO2 capture was due to the highly efficient carbon stripper included
in the 100 kWth unit. Fuel combustion was more efficient because of
improved contact between gases from coal conversion and oxygen
carrier particles, which was also promoted by a better mix between
char and oxygen carrier particles.

PIn order to improve the gas-solid contact to further decrease the
oxygen demand, a moving bed as fuel reactor is an interesting
option. Table 6 shows results from the 25 kWth CLC unit at OSU unit
using Fe2O3 as oxygen carrier and solid fuels such as metallurgical
coal, lignite and sub-bituminous coal. High solid fuel conversions
(95(cid:1)96%) and CO2 purity of more than 99% at the outlet of the fuel
reactor were reached [53,152,153,241]. In tests with sub-bituminous
coal, CO2 capture efficiencies around 95% and oxygen demands (VFR)
as low as 0.14% were registered [153]. However, in order to consider
the moving bed as an alternative to the circulating fluidized bed,
operational problems arising from the large particle size needed and
the existence of temperature gradients in the fuel reactor should
first be solved.

PFollowing the comprehensive analysis above of the influence of
different operating variables on CO2 capture efficiency and oxygen
demand in a CLC system, Figs. 31 and 32 are presented as a graphic
summary. Both figures are based on results in CLC units at ICB-CSIC
and CUT. Fig. 31 was obtained for the combustion of bituminous
and sub-bituminous coals. Interesting general conclusions can be
obtained from comparing these results using Fe-based oxygen car-
riers with different reactivity. First, the increase in both the resi-
dence time in the fuel reactor and the fuel reactor temperature led
to an increase in CO2 capture efficiency. Second, the presence of a
carbon stripper enabled high CO2 capture with short residence times
(see results from the 50 kWth unit in Fig. 31A). In Fig. 31B, where
both CLC units incorporate a carbon stripper, high values of CO2 cap-
ture were obtained regardless of the residence time.

PA similar concluding analysis can be performed for the total oxy-
gen demand in Fig. 32. From the figure, it is clear that both the oxy-
gen carrier to fuel ratio and the specific solids inventory in the FR
affect the value of the total oxygen demand (VT). For the same type
of solid fuel, high solids inventories decrease the total oxygen
demand. However, the influence of the oxygen carrier to fuel ratio
on the total oxygen demand is much less. In Fig. 32A, the total oxy-
gen demand is also affected by the reactivity of the oxygen carrier.
In
The higher the reactivity, the lower the oxygen demanded.
Fig. 32B, the effect of the type of solid fuel can be observed. Lower
oxygen demand values were achieved from petcoke in the 10 kWth
unit. The design also affected the final value of oxygen demand, as
results for petcoke and bituminous coal in the 10 kWth reactor show
that lower oxygen demand values were obtained when the fuel was
fed inside the fuel reactor bed.

4.3. Variables affecting the performance of the CLOU unit

PThe variables affecting the performance of the CLOU process are
the same as those shown in Fig. 25 for iG-CLC. In this case, the tem-
perature in both fuel and air reactors becomes even more important.
Appropriate control and optimization are needed to obtain the
amount of oxygen required in the fuel reactor, and complete regen-
eration of the oxygen carrier in the air reactor. The optimum temper-
ature values for the specific oxygen carrier have been researched in
different studies summarized in Table 5. In these studies, the influ-
ence on CO2 capture and oxygen demand of different variables such
as coal rank, coal feeding rate and solids inventory in the fuel reactor
were also investigated. Results are summarized below.

PThe use of oxygen carriers with CLOU properties significantly
improves the performance of CLC of solid fuels. Although there is an
increasing number of studies on the development of this type of
material [64,67,77,78], only a few have been tested in a continuous
CLC unit burning solid fuels. Fig. 33 shows the values of CO2 capture

Pefficiency for different fuel reactor temperatures and the oxygen
carriers tested. At ICB-CSIC, two Cu-based oxygen carriers based
on CuO (50(cid:1)60%) and supported on MgAl2O4, i.e. Cu60MgAl and
Cu50Fe10MgAl, were tested in the 0.5 kWth continuous unit burning
coals and biomass [142,143,199,252]. The oxygen transport capacity,
ROC, of these oxygen carriers was 6 and 4.5 wt.%, respectively. The
proof of the CLOU concept was carried out in the 0.5 kWth CLC unit
with Cu60MgAl material and a bituminous coal. At temperatures for
coal combustion, both of the oxygen carriers showed complete com-
bustion of volatile/gasification products, regardless the solid fuel
used. A total of 75 hours of continuous operation were run with
these Cu-based materials. However, after this time, a decrease in the
mechanical strength linked to an increase in the porosity of the
materials was observed [143]. This same tendency had been
observed before in experiments in a batch fluidized bed reactor [68].
Thus, improvements in the lifetime of these materials should be
incorporated in order to be considered for further scale-up.

PA perovskite-type oxygen carrier (CaMn0.9Mg0.1O3-d) with partial
CLOU properties has been tested in the 10 kWth unit at CUT using
both petcoke and biochar with low sulfur content as fuels [57,117].
The same material had previously been tested with gaseous fuels,
when complete combustion of natural gas was reached [253]. In the
experiments with solid fuels, this oxygen carrier showed better per-
formance than other materials such as ilmenite, although the oxygen
release rate was slower than for Cu-based oxygen carriers [81,117].
Using petcoke as fuel, the combustion efficiency increased from
76.4% with ilmenite to 92.3% when the perovskite oxygen carrier
was used. However, during the experiments with petcoke, sulfur
accumulation in the oxygen carrier was observed, which affected its
performance and made a regeneration step necessary.

P4.3.1. Relevance of the temperature in the fuel reactor

PThe operating temperature in fuel and air reactors is a crucial
parameter in the CLOU process because the oxygen concentration at
the gas-solid equilibrium and the temperature are highly inter-
dependent. Fig. 34 shows the oxygen equilibrium partial pressure
with temperature for the main redox pairs in CLOU processes. Under
CLOU mode, the temperatures in the reactors of a CLC unit should be
optimized for each oxygen carrier. In order to maintain high effi-
ciency in the CLOU process while complete combustion of the solid
fuel is reached, the presence of oxygen at the outlet stream of the
fuel reactor should be limited, so that the purity of the captured CO2
is as high as possible. It is desirable to keep the outlet partial

Ppressure of oxygen from the air reactor as low as possible. An oxygen
concentration of 4% is a typical value. In the case of Cu-based
oxygen carriers, Abad et al. [142] found the temperature interval
900(cid:1)950 °C in the fuel reactor as adequate to avoid a large excess of
oxygen in the outlet stream. They also observed an increase in the
CO2 capture efficiency as temperature increased.
It should be
remembered that both the oxygen partial pressure at equilibrium
and the char combustion rate rise with the temperature, thus
increasing CO2 capture.

PThe combination of Cu and Mn oxides can shift the temperature
interval for oxygen release to lower temperatures when compared
to Cu and Mn oxides alone. In recent experiments by Ad(cid:1)anez-Rubio
et al. [88] with a Cu-Mn mixed oxide, lower temperatures could be
reached in the fuel reactor (850 °C) while allowing complete com-
bustion of the fuel.

POther materials tested in CLC of solid fuels comprise the use of a
perovskite-type oxygen carrier (CaMn0.9Mg0.1O3-d) in the 10 kWth
CLC unit at CUT. It was found that a temperature range 950(cid:1)1000 °C
in the fuel reactor was required to promote CLOU [57,117]. Better
CO2 capture efficiencies and oxygen demand values were obtained
compared to ilmenite.

P4.3.2. Relevance of the solids circulation rate

PThere is also some information in the literature regarding the
effect of the solids circulation rate on the performance of the com-
bustion of a solid fuel under CLOU mode [254]. In experiments with
Cu-based oxygen carriers in the 0.5 kWth unit at ICB-CSIC, an
increase in the solids circulation rate caused a reduction in the CO2
capture efficiency [142]. This was attributed to a decrease in the
char residence time in the fuel reactor as the solids circulation rate
increased. However, no changes in the combustion efficiency were
detected, although the solids conversion fell sharply from about 90%
to 20%. In every case, the oxygen carrier released the oxygen needed
to reach complete combustion of the fuel [142].

PThis was not so with Cu-Mn mixed oxide also tested in the same
ICB-CSIC unit [88]. This time, the degree of conversion of the solids
affected the amount of oxygen released and, therefore, the decrease
in CO2 capture efficiency was more noticeable as it was affected
both by a reduction in the oxygen available and shorter residence
time in the fuel reactor. The use of a carbon stripper would be
recommended in this case to maintain an adequate value for CO2
capture efficiency. Nevertheless, combustion efficiency was not sig-
nificantly affected.

PHowever, for less reactive coals, the use of a carbon stripper is also
proposed in order to obtain high CO2 capture efficiencies. The pres-
ence of a carbon stripper would also reduce the solids inventory
needed. Moreover, the efficiency required for the carbon stripper in
a CLOU operating unit is not as high as that needed for iG-CLC mode
[55,112].

P4.3.6. Effect of the design

PA comparison between different reactor designs for the CLOU
process was recently published by Utah University [255]. Two con-
figurations were analyzed. One used circulating fluidized beds for
both the air and the fuel reactor, whereas the other used bubbling
fluidized beds for both reactors. A computational fluid dynamic
model was developed and validated for each configuration, with
several performance parameters of the CLOU unit being evalu-
ated as a function of the total solids inventory and gas flows.
The parameters evaluated were the solids circulation rate, the
residence time, the pressure profiles in the reactors and loop
seals and the velocity of the particles at different locations. As
with iG-CLC, the dual CFB configuration proved more convenient
for operation under CLOU mode, mainly due to the larger range
of solids circulation rate that can be achieved. Nevertheless, if
the solids circulation rate is not limited, high combustion effi-
ciencies could be also obtained using a bubbling fluidized bed as
fuel reactor. Solids inventories as low as 200 kg/MWth could
enable complete combustion of coal.

PA moving bed could also be an option for the CLOU process. How-
ever, special attention should be paid to the design in order to
ensure contact between the volatiles released by the fuel and the
oxygen released by the oxygen carrier.

P4.3.7. iG-CLC assisted by oxygen uncoupling (CLaOU)

PAn alternative option to improve the reactivity of oxygen carriers
is to develop CLaOU materials. These materials are able to release
oxygen under optimized conditions, although it was mostly trans-
ferred via reduction with gaseous compounds, e.g. H2, CO or CH4,
such as occurs in iG-CLC.

PIn the 0.5 kWth unit at ICB-CSIC, Fe-Mn based oxides with oxygen
transport capacities between 6.7(cid:1)7.7 wt.% were tested as an oxygen
carrier [79]. Some showed a certain oxygen uncoupling capacity (up
to 12% of ROC) due to the incorporation of TiO2 into the mixed oxide
structure [89]. These Fe-Mn-materials developed at
ICB-CSIC
reached combustion efficiencies of 99.5%, higher than those previ-
ously reported with other Fe-based oxygen carriers tested in the
same unit [89].

PFor these Fe-Mn materials, P(cid:1)erez-Vega et al. [89] proposed a
fuel reactor temperature of 900 °C and an air reactor tempera-
ture of 800 °C, in order to reduce excess oxygen to 4% in the air
reactor. The temperature difference between reactors could be
further decreased if the excess air in the air reactor is increased
with respect to the stoichiometric air. Together with the fuel and
air reactor temperatures, control of the solids circulation rate
was crucial in order to be able to regenerate the oxygen carrier
in the air reactor sufficiently so that it could release oxygen in
the fuel reactor to aid combustion via iG-CLC, which is the basis
of the CLaOU process. As these results are promising, more
research into the development of this type of oxygen carrier can
be expected in the coming years.

PWith the perovskite type CaMn0.9Mg0.1O3-d oxygen carrier tested
at the 10 kWth unit at CUT with solid fuels, a faster solids circulation
rate due to an increase in the air reactor gas flow led to a decrease in
both the CO2 capture and the oxygen demand [57].

P4.3.3. Relevance of the specific solids inventory in the fuel reactor

PRegarding the effect of the solids inventory in the fuel reactor in
CLC of coal under the CLOU mode, Abad et al. [142] performed
experiments with a Cu-based oxygen carrier and a bituminous coal,
varying the coal feeding rate and maintaining the fuel reactor tem-
perature and solids circulation rate. In this way, the specific solids
inventory per thermal power in the fuel reactor was decreased
when the coal feeding rate increased. They observed complete com-
bustion to H2O and CO2 in all the experiments. No relevant effect on
the CO2 capture efficiency was observed as there was excess oxygen
in the fuel reactor in every case. Under these experimental condi-
tions, the oxygen generated in the fuel reactor was not limited by
the reactivity of the oxygen carrier [142], and its maximum oxygen
release rate was determined in batch fluidized bed experiments;
according to these, the solids inventory in the fuel reactor required
to reach complete combustion of CO2 and H2O was estimated to be
as low as 39 kg/MWth at 930 °C [254]. This value of the solids inven-
tory in the fuel reactor was significantly lower than that needed for
high combustion efficiencies in the iG-CLC process; see Figs. 32.

P4.3.4. Effect of the H2O/CO2 ratio

PIn CLOU, oxygen in the oxygen carrier is mainly released as gas-
eous O2 in the fuel reactor, which will react with the fuel the same
as in common air combustion processes. Thus, char gasification is
not required as an intermediate step in the solid fuel conversion, as
occurs with iG-CLC. In order to test the influence of the presence of
steam in the fluidizing agent, CO2/H2O mixtures were used in experi-
ments carried out in the 0.5 kWth CLC unit at ICB-CSIC, which
showed that similar CO2 capture or combustion efficiency was
obtained in the presence of H2O or CO2 [199]. Therefore, recirculated
CO2 could be used as fluidizing medium instead of steam, which
would lower costs.

P4.3.5. Effect of the coal rank

PThe effect of the coal rank on the performance of CLOU was also
evaluated at ICB-CSIC using a Cu-based oxygen carrier and four dif-
ferent coals (lignite, two bituminous and anthracite) [58]. Regardless
of the coal rank tested, complete combustion to CO2 and H2O was
obtained with an excess of oxygen at the fuel reactor outlet. As with
iG-CLC, the CO2 capture efficiencies were high for low-ranking coals.

P4.3.8. Comparison of the iG-CLC and CLOU processes

PFor better clarity, Table 7 presents a summary of the above dis-
cussions on the influence of operating parameters on the perfor-
mance of both iG-CLC and CLOU.

PThe presence of gaseous oxygen achieves combustion efficiencies
of 100% in CLOU mode with a clearly lower solids inventory than in
operation under iG-CLC mode. CO2 capture values can be optimized

Pby using a carbon stripper, whose efficiency need not necessarily be
as high as in iG-CLC. The requirement to supply steam to the fuel
reactor and carbon stripper is also avoided in CLOU, and recirculated
CO2 could be used instead. These facts make the CLOU process more
advantageous when compared to iG-CLC. However, better control of
the temperatures in the fuel and air reactors is required in CLOU, to
optimize oxygen release and uptake. Another drawback is the short
lifetime of the CLOU materials developed to date, which increases
the need for a make-up flow. Moreover, the costs of the CLOU pro-
cess would benefit from separating oxygen carrier particles from the
ashes.

4.4. Combustion of biomass in iG-CLC and CLOU

PAmong the various options for achieving negative CO2 emissions,
most low-carbon scenarios rely on the use of BECCS (Bioenergy and
CO2 Capture and Storage) technologies [32]. Biomass is a CO2-neutral
fuel, i.e. the carbon dioxide released during biomass combustion has
been previously removed from the atmosphere during biomass
growth. If this CO2 is captured, then negative CO2 emissions are
achieved [256(cid:1)260]. Obviously, biomass-fueled CLC is taken as a
BECCS technology [158]. Recently, research has been conducted to
assess how the different properties of biomass compared to coal
influence CLC performance [261]. The amount of volatiles released
by biomass are larger than for coal, and biomass char is known to be
more reactive than coal char, which would increase both the CO2
capture efficiency and the oxygen demand for the process compared
to the use of coal. Biomass ash components also differ from those in
coal, and any interaction between oxygen carrier and biomass ashes
should be assessed. There are significant advantages to be gained
from using biomass in CLC compared to conventional biomass com-
bustion. In addition to a CO2 negative balance, higher thermal effi-
ciency, reduction in NOx formation, and lower corrosion in heat
exchangers is expected. It must be remembered that heat in CLC sys-
tems is extracted in the air reactor where no alkaline components
are present [261].

PMost of the research on the use of biomass has been carried out
under iG-CLC mode with Fe-based oxygen carriers [39,56,127,139,
141,158,161]. One of the most relevant findings is that CO2 can be
used instead of H2O as a fluidizing gas, with the corresponding energy
saving associated with steam generation [39,139,141]. However, vola-
tile matter is difficult to burn [141,158], which explains the high

Poxygen demand often encountered. Following an analysis of the tar
present in the combustion gases at the fuel reactor outlet, the content
was observed to be relatively low [139]. Moreover, almost full conver-
sion of biomass to gaseous species was achieved in a bench scale pro-
totype using CO2 as the gasification enhancer in the bottom part of a
moving bed acting as fuel reactor [262].

PBiomass combustion experiments in CLOU mode were con-
ducted at ICB-CSIC [56, 143]. Important advantages compared to
operating in iG-CLC mode were observed, such as the absence of
unburnt/tar compounds at the fuel reactor outlet and the high CO2
capture efficiencies reached, with solids inventories in the fuel
reactor being much lower than in the iG-CLC process. However,
there remains the need to find a durable and resistant oxygen car-
rier for CLOU.

PA comparison between results obtained in iG-CLC and CLOU
modes in the same unit has been performed using biomass as fuel
[56]. Results shown in Fig. 35 highlight the differences found in CO2
capture (hCC) and combustion efficiency (hcomb,FR) between both
modes.

POn a larger scale, more than 1000 h of operational experience
using biomass has recently been reported in the Chalmers boiler/
gasifier loop (12 MWth/ 2(cid:1)4 MWth respectively) using ilmenite and
manganese ores as oxygen carriers and wood pellets as fuel [166].
For these tests, the 2(cid:1)4 MWth gasifier was used as the fuel reactor
and the 12 MWth boiler as the air reactor. The effect of different
operating variables, such as fluidization velocity, fuel feeding rate,
and solids circulation rate were analyzed. Although this plant is a
non-optimized reactor design for CLC applications, relevant informa-
tion for CLC combustion of biomass was obtained.

PThe same 12 MWth circulating fluidizing bed boiler was also used
for the Oxygen Carrier aided Combustion (OCAC) process using
ilmenite or manganese ore as bed material and wood chips as fuel
[263,264]. OCAC refers to the process where an oxygen carrier
instead of an inert solid is used as bed material in combustion in a
fluidized bed boiler [265,266]. In this process, the active oxygen car-
rier is reduced in fuel rich parts of the boiler and oxidized in oxygen
rich locations. This technology has some interesting advantages over
the use of silica sand in large CFB boilers, and is an excellent way of
testing oxygen carriers before scaling up CLC units. In fact, promising
results were found during combustion of municipal solid waste in
a 75 MWth fluidized bed combustor using ilmenite as the oxygen
carrier [267].

PRelevant lessons can be learned for CLC development from OCAC.
However, some aspects must be considered in order to extrapolate
oxygen carrier behavior from OCAC to CLC. For example, interaction
with ash and extent of the reaction of the oxygen carrier may be dif-
ferent, which would affect particle ageing [268].

PIn short, although recent advances predict a high potential for
bio-CLC, there are still important challenges to overcome. Some of
these concern the interaction among oxygen carriers and biomass
ashes during long exposure. Although Na deposition on the iron ore
based oxygen carrier particles does not seem to be a problem [269],
the interaction of alkaline compounds with Mn-based oxygen car-
riers should be further investigated.

4.5. Evaluation of pollutant release in iG-CLC and CLOU processes

PThe performance of a CLC unit may be affected by pollutant for-
mation during the combustion process. Pollutant formation in CLC
could generate both environmental and operational problems, as
shown in Fig. 36. Gaseous pollutants emitted in the air reactor will
reach the atmosphere and, therefore, must comply with the current
legislation for pollutant emission from power generation systems.
Gaseous pollutants present at the outlet stream from the fuel reactor

Paffect the quality of the CO2 captured and their presence should be
taken into account in further conditioning of the CO2 stream, in
order for these to be stored safely [270].

PAnother aspect to be taken into account is the solid pollutants
generated in a CLC unit. On one hand, solid fines from the oxygen
carrier can be generated by attrition and lost by elutriation. This elu-
triated material should be recovered to avoid emission to the atmo-
sphere and operational problems downstream. On the other hand,
combustion of solid fuels generates ashes that should be drained
from the CLC system to avoid accumulation. During drainage, some
oxygen carrier particles may be lost together with the ashes. These
solid streams should be characterized and their disposal evaluated.
In this respect, the literature reports that leaching tests have been
used to analyze problems that might arise from disposing of these
residues in a landfill [271].

PUp to now, studies on pollutant formation in iG-CLC or CLOU
have mainly focused on sulfur and nitrogen emissions [126,129, 133,
153,196,199,202,252,272,273], but some studies on mercury emis-
sions have also been presented recently [198,199,272]. Once coal is
fed into the fuel reactor of the iG-CLC or CLOU system, a fraction of
sulfur, nitrogen and mercury in the coal is released in the volatiles.
The rest remains in the char. If this char reaches the air reactor, the

Pnitrogen, sulfur and mercury in the char will be released in the air
reactor during combustion of unconverted char. Sulfur can also accu-
mulate in the oxygen carrier and may cause deactivation. A brief
update on the formation of pollutants in iG-CLC or CLOU units is
included here to outline the main results.

Pfound with this kind of material in the presence of sulfur [113]. It is
worth mentioning that regeneration studies have been carried out
both for Cu-based [277] and calcium manganate oxygen carriers
[57,117].

P4.5.1. Fate of sulfur

P4.5.1.1. Sulfur emission in iG-CLC.
PMany of the studies performed
with different fuels in CLC units ranging from 0.5 kWth to 1 MWth
concluded that, under typical iG-CLC operating conditions, most of
the sulfur in coal was released in the fuel reactor, mainly in the form
of H2S and SO2 [126,159,272]. The H2S/SO2 molar ratio has been
reported to be about 25/75 in studies using ilmenite at ICB-CSIC
[272] or ilmenite/manganese ore at CUT [122]. A similar ratio
(16/84) was reported using an iron ore based on hematite [100].

PThe H2S/SO2 molar ratio in the fuel reactor decreased when tem-
perature in the fuel reactor increased as the oxidation reaction of
H2S to SO2 was helped by the oxygen carrier. In the air reactor, sulfur
was always found in SO2 form due to sulfur present in unconverted
char. The amount of SO2 decreased when the temperature in the fuel
reactor increased as a lower char flow reached the air reactor [272].
PThe LCLTM process by Alstom Power deserves special mention
when assessing sulfur emissions. The system eliminates SO2 emis-
sion by adding limestone together with the coal fed [192]. In fact,
sulfated limestone has been found to be an efficient oxygen car-
rier, due to its high oxygen transport capacity and reactivity [111].
Coal combustion with high sulfur retention and low SO2 emissions
has been reported in the 3 MWth CLC unit [164], similar to the
process taking place in circulating fluidized beds with in-situ
desulfurization.

PAs mentioned before, the fate of sulfur compounds in a CLC unit is
of interest not only for environmental or CO2 quality, but also
because sulfur compounds can poison the oxygen carrier used. Oxy-
gen carrier interaction with gaseous sulfur compounds has been
reported before with Ni-based oxygen carriers [175]. When coal was
used with a Ni-based oxygen carriers, nickel sulfide/sulfate forma-
tion was observed, leading to a decrease in the oxygen carrier reac-
tivity [125]. Nevertheless, note that the use of a Ni-based material
with coal would not be advisable due to environmental issues.

PFor Fe-based materials, no dedicated studies have been done to
evaluate the interaction with sulfur. Nevertheless, when reduced to
Fe3O4, sulfur compounds would not be expected to form, according
to thermodynamic calculations [181,274]. In fact, an impregnated
Fe-based oxygen carrier was successfully used recently in the com-
bustion of sour and acid gases containing up to 20 vol% H2S, and
even solid elemental sulfur, without any sign of sulfide/sulfate for-
mation or lower reactivity [275,276]. It can be concluded therefore
that Fe-based oxygen carriers are suitable for use with coals with
high sulfur content.

P4.5.1.2. Sulfur emission in CLOU.
PThe literature gives information on
the emission of sulfur pollutants in CLOU combustion. In experi-
ments carried out with a high-sulfur lignite and two different Cu-
based oxygen carriers [199,252] it was observed that most of the sul-
fur in coal was released as SO2 in the fuel reactor. No H2S was
detected, as it was completely oxidized by the oxygen released by
the oxygen carrier. The same occurred with iG-CLC, where the
amount released also increased when the fuel reactor temperature
increased. However, in this case, a partial reaction of SO2 with CuO
to form (CuO)¢(CuSO4) was detected. Formation of copper sulfate
would decrease the oxygen transport capacity of the oxygen carrier
although the reactivity would not be affected.

POther oxygen carriers with partial CLOU capabilities, such as
those based on CaMnO3, were also affected by the presence of sulfur
compounds in the gases [57,113,117]. Formation of CaSO4 has been

P4.5.2. Fate of nitrogen

POne of the main advantages of
P4.5.2.1. Nitrogen emission in iG-CLC.
CLC when compared to other combustion processes is that no ther-
mal NOx is generated because the temperatures reached in the air
reactor where air is introduced are not high enough [278].

PIn iG-CLC, the only contribution to NOx formation is the nitrogen
contained in the fuel (fuel-N) [273]. NH3, HCN and HNCO are the spe-
cies normally released during coal devolatilization. Under reaction
conditions in the fuel reactor, these nitrogen species can be oxidized
to NOx or converted to N2. Although some authors reported the pres-
ence of significant amounts of NH3 at the fuel reactor outlet [100],
the majority of the studies performed under iG-CLC conditions found
that most of the nitrogen was released in the fuel reactor in the form
of N2, with minor amounts of NO [129,202,272]. In this respect,
some authors found that the fraction of fuel-N converted to gaseous
NO is higher with faster global solids circulation [121].

PThe nitrogen in the non-converted char reaching the air reactor is
normally released as NO [159,272,273]. As mentioned before, tem-
peratures in the air reactor are not high enough to cause thermal
NOx to form [278]. As with SO2 emissions in the air reactor, NO emis-
sions decreased with the increase in the fuel reactor temperature
due to higher char conversion in the fuel reactor [272,273]. In fact,
no NOx formation was observed in the air reactor with high fuel con-
version in the fuel reactor, as occurred in the 25 kWth CLC unit at
OSU using a moving bed as fuel reactor [153]. The NOx measure-
ments made there indicated that around 10(cid:1)15% of the fuel-N was
converted to NOx in the fuel reactor. No other nitrogen oxide species
were detected in the fuel or air reactor.

P4.5.2.2. Nitrogen emission in CLOU.
PSome differences have been
found in nitrogen pollutant formation in combustion in CLOU mode
in comparison with iG-CLC combustion. In both processes, the only
nitrogen compounds found were NO and N2 in the fuel reactor and
NO in the air reactor. However, in CLOU mode, about 20 wt.% of the
nitrogen evolved in the fuel reactor was in the form of NO, while
only 1% of the nitrogen was NO in the iG-CLC process [199, 272]. The
differences can be attributed to the presence of gaseous oxygen in
the fuel reactor in CLOU, which favored the conversion of nitrogen
species to NO, while the reducing atmosphere in iG-CLC favored
reduction to N2.

P4.5.3. Fate of mercury

PAlthough mercury content in coal is very low, mercury emis-
sions in coal combustion processes are deemed both an environ-
mental and a health risk. Mercury is a highly volatile toxic element
with a tendency to accumulate in both plant and animal tissues.
Therefore, mercury emissions from coal should be kept to a mini-
mum. In addition, operational problems could appear in the CO2
conditioning step when CO2 capture is considered. To date, few
studies in the literature have analyzed the fate of mercury in iG-
CLC or CLOU [198,199,272].

P4.5.3.1. Mercury emission in iG-CLC.
PAt ICB-CSIC, dedicated experi-
ments with Fe-based oxygen carriers and two types of coal (lignite
and anthracite) were performed to evaluate the fate of Hg in iG-CLC
[198]. It was found that the fraction of mercury released in the fuel
reactor during coal gasification depended on both the fuel reactor
temperature interval and the coal rank. An increase in temperature
favored mercury release. However, the presence of significant pyrite
content in the coal reduced the volatility of mercury. Once released,

Pmercury was found in the fuel reactor atmosphere mostly as Hg0,
although the mercury in the char reaching the air reactor was mainly
found as Hg2þ at the air reactor outlet stream. It should be noted that
mercury speciation in the gaseous stream (Hg0 or Hg2þ) determines
the control measures to be applied to mercury, as Hg2þ is much
more easily removed that Hg0. The mercury content in the solid fines
at the outlet of the air reactor, Hg(p), was negligible.

P4.5.3.2. Mercury emission in CLOU.
PAt ICB-CSIC, studies on mercury
emissions under CLOU conditions with a copper based oxygen car-
rier were performed [199]. The operational experience highlights
the different mercury emissions registered under iG-CLC or CLOU
operation. While the ratio Hg0 (g) /Hgtotal (g) in fuel and air reactors
was very similar for both processes, the amount of mercury in gas-
eous state released from both reactors was much lower in CLOU. In
this process, a large amount of mercury was retained as particulate-
bond mercury Hg(p) in the ashes elutriated from the system. The
highly oxidizing atmosphere present in the CLOU process, together
with the mercury oxidation caused by the presence of copper in the
oxygen carrier meant that most of the mercury released during coal
combustion was oxidized to Hg2þ making its retention in coal ashes
easier.

P4.5.4. Fate of tar.
PTar formation is common in any gasification pro-
cess. However, the presence of an oxygen carrier in CLC mode
greatly reduces their content [56,136,166]. The most common
method for tar determination is the standarized tar protocol [279].
However, the literature reports other methods also used for improv-
ing tar collection, such as Solid Phase Adsorption (SPA) [280].

P4.5.4.1. Tar presence in iG-CLC.
PThe type of fuel seems to have a deci-
sive influence on the amount of tar in the CO2 stream. In fact, no tars
were detected during experiments at ICB-CSIC using coals of differ-
ent rank and various oxygen carriers, such as ilmenite [136(cid:1)138],
bauxite waste material [140], or iron ore [101]. However, the use of
other solid fuels with higher volatile matter, such as biomass, gener-
ates tar in the outlet stream of the fuel reactor, affecting the quality
of the CO2 stream. Tests carried out with several biomasses (pine
sawdust, olive stone and almond shell) and Tierga Fe-ore as oxygen
carrier in the 0.5 kWth CLC unit at ICB-CSIC showed tar contents of
about 2.5(cid:1)4.5 g/Nm3 at temperatures 950(cid:1)980 °C. An increase in
the operating temperature always led to a decrease in the amount of
tar present in the fuel reactor outlet stream. Fig. 37 shows an exam-
ple of the tar composition obtained at 980 °C. Naphthalene was the
major compound detected, followed by lower amounts of styrene,
acenaphthylene and phenantrene [139, 281].

PData obtained in the 4 MWth Chalmers gasifier during more than
1000 h of operation using commercial wood pellets and different
oxygen carriers, is of special importance [166]. Yields of SPA-mea-
surable tar, including BTX, of 21(cid:1)22 g /kg daf fuel using ilmenite and
a manganese ore as oxygen carriers were reported. The major com-
pounds detected were benzene, toluene, naphthalene, styrene and
indene, representing approximately 73(cid:1)81% of the total mass of SPA
species. The yield of hydrocarbons heavier than benzene was in the
range of 10(cid:1)11 g/Nm3, which was 70% (w/w) lower than that
obtained in a reference case with silica-sand as the bed material.
These values were higher than those reported during tests at ICB-
CSIC. Apart from the different methodology used in tar collection
and analysis, the differences can be also attributed to the lower tem-
perature (810(cid:1)830 °C) and a non-optimized contact between the
oxygen carrier and the gasification products.

PReed et al. [282] limited the tar content valid for compressing and
piping a biomass gasification gas any distance to the range of
0.05(cid:1)0.5 g/Nm3 Although the tar content values reported in litera-
ture for biomass fueled iG-CLC are higher than those limits, no foul-
ing problems downstream from the fuel reactor due to the presence

Pof tar are anticipated. In addition, it would be expected tar com-
pounds will be burnt during the oxygen polishing step in an indus-
trial CLC unit.

PCalculations made by Mendiara et al. [281] showed that the total
oxygen demand for tar would be about 1%, so that it should be taken
into account in the oxygen polishing step. However, tar does not rep-
resent a problem in CLC, since the oxygen demanded by other
unburned gaseous compounds (CO, H2 and CH4) is expected to be
significantly higher.

either coal or biomass under CLOU mode demonstrated the absence
of tar at the fuel reactor outlet [56,142,143]. The presence of gaseous
oxygen in the fuel reactor led to complete combustion of the tar
compounds, even in those cases where a high volatile fuel is proc-
essed, such as biomass.

P4.5.5. Overview on gaseous pollutant emission in CLC

PThe gaseous emissions in the CLC process originate in combus-
tion of the unconverted char reaching the air reactor. It can be specu-
lated that the presence of an efficient carbon stripper in the CLC unit
[272] might help in controlling sulfur and nitrogen emissions from
the air reactor in a CLC system. Should the emissions exceed those
set by current legislation, control measures already in use in the cur-
rent power plants could be applied.

PRegarding the quality of the CO2 at the outlet of the fuel reactor,
only recommendations concerning the presence of certain com-
pounds have been given, including unburnt compounds (CO, CH4,
H2) and O2 [270]. For sulfur and nitrogen emissions, the recommen-
dations only apply to the levels of H2S, SO2, N2 and NOx, but no rec-
ommendations for mercury have been specified [270], despite the
operational problems that mercury can cause in the CO2 condition-
ing equipment and transportation pipelines. Table 8 compares the
values for SO2 and NOx obtained in recent studies in fuel and air
reactors working in iG-CLC or CLOU modes [199,272] with the values
set as appropriate for CO2 transport and storage (fuel reactor), and
those set by legislation for emissions to the atmosphere (air reactor).
The EU legal limit (Directive 2010/75/UE) [283] established for new
built power plants up to 300 MWth is 150 mg/Nm3 (6% O2), for SO2
and NOx emissions.

P4.5.6. Residues

PSolids residue generation in a CLC system is an important aspect
to be considered due to the amount of waste that can be generated.
However, no in-depth analysis of this aspect has been carried out by
now.

PIn the combustion of a solid fuel, ashes are generated in the fuel
reactor and they should be periodically removed from the system in
order to avoid solid accumulation and the subsequent operational
problems. One of the main concerns in solid-fueled CLC is the possi-
ble loss of oxygen carrier in the ash drainage process. In order to
minimize these losses some solutions are being proposed. Recently,
the use of a rotating fluidized bed was tested to improve the gas-
solid and solid-solid separation process efficiency in comparison to
conventional fluidized beds [284]. In addition, the use of oxygen car-
riers with magnetic properties could be also valid [240], especially
for high-expensive CLOU materials.

PTogether with the ash drainage stream, the oxygen carrier fines
lost by elutriation constitute the other source of solid residues in
solid-fueled CLC. Depending on the nature of the oxygen carrier
used and the solid fuel ashes, the presence of soluble toxic trace ele-
ments should be analyzed in order to assess whether to dispose of
them in a landfill. In this respect, lixiviation studies of depleted oxy-
gen carriers have been reported in literature for Fe-based materials,
commonly used in the iG-CLC process [271] and in this case, the
majority could be disposed in a landfill for nonreactive hazardous
waste.

5. Evaluation and extrapolation of experimental results in iG-CLC
units

PThe design of large CLC units should be based on the results
obtained from currently operating CLC plants. As has been shown
in previous sections, there are significant differences in the results
available in the literature, which complicates the scale-up process.
The main concerns in the performance of the iG-CLC process in
CLC units are the fact that the conversion of the solid fuel is not
complete (Xsf < 1) due to partial recovery of char by the fuel reac-
tor cyclone [42,101,123,136,145,147,148,196]. In addition, uncon-
verted char can pass to the air reactor, thus decreasing the real
char fraction converted in the fuel reactor, and hence the CO2 cap-
ture (hCC < 1). This presence of unconverted char in streams exit-
ing the fuel reactor makes it difficult to extrapolate the current
information to what could be expected in a larger iG-CLC system
where both hCC and Xsf should be as close to 100% as possible.

PThe extrapolation is not straightforward because it is not simple
to calculate how much of the volatiles and gasification products
evolved in the fuel reactor would be converted if Xsf 1⁄4 1, as it
depends, among other factors, on the solid fuel used and the type of
reactor technology in the fuel reactor, e.g. bubbling fluidized bed
(BFB), circulating fluidized bed (CFB) or spouted fluidized bed (SFB).
Nevertheless, it would be very interesting to be able to predict

Presults in an optimized unit from the results obtained in these
smaller units, which are easier to operate and where the influence of
different combustion parameters on the performance of the unit is
more easily evaluated. Therefore, this section presents a novel meth-
odology, based on current experimental results from CLC units, that
helps to predict the expected values of oxygen demand when com-
plete combustion of the solid fuel is reached (VT,full).

PThe oxygen required to burn the solid fuel, expressed as the kilo-
grams of oxygen needed to burn one kilogram of solid fuel (Vsf), can
be defined as the sum of the oxygen demanded by the volatiles
released, (Vvol) and the oxygen demand of the char generated
(Vchar).
1⁄4 V
V
ð13Þ
sf
PTo calculate Vchar it can be assumed that the char is solely formed
of carbon and ash. Some of the carbon in the char will be lost by elu-
triation, thus reducing the value of the solid fuel conversion (Xsf).
Therefore, the values of the total oxygen demand (VT) and the oxy-
gen demand in the fuel reactor (VFR) can be calculated, based on
Eqs. (14) and (15) and equations in Fig. 22, as:

where hcomb,v and hcomb,g represent the combustion efficiency of
the volatiles and char gasification products (mainly CO and H2),
i.e. how much of the volatiles and CO/H2 from char gasification
would be burned by the oxygen carrier particles to CO2 and H2O.
If the value of xchar,FR is equal to one, complete gasification of the
fixed carbon would be achieved and this would correspond to a
CO2 capture efficiency value of 100% see Eqs. (6). The idea behind
the methodology presented in this paper is the following. Once a
value of VFR or VT has been estimated for an experimental value
of xchar,FR, it can be extrapolated to another xchar,FR value, know-
ing the combustion efficiency of the volatiles released (hcomb,v)
and the combustion efficiency of the gasification products (hcomb,
g).

PAs mentioned before, the values of hcomb,v and hcomb,g in Eqs. (14)
and (15) depend heavily on the solid fuel used and the configuration
of the CLC unit where they were obtained. Depending on the values
of hcomb,v and hcomb,g, different behaviors of the oxygen demand can
be found. Fig. 38A to C show three typical examples. In all of these,
the fuel used was the bituminous Colombian coal “El Cerrej(cid:1)on”, as
there is enough information on this fuel available in the literature.
The oxygen demand for char (Vchar) and volatile matter (Vvol) can
be calculated from the analyses of coal and char. Table 9 presents

Fig. 38. VFR and VT for different values of the carbon fraction in char gasified in the fuel reactor. Dashed line represents the oxygen demand level considering complete conver-
sion of the solid fuel. “El Cerrej(cid:1)on” bituminous coal is considered as fuel in all the Figures [136].

Pthe ultimate and proximate analysis of “El Cerrej(cid:1)on” Colombian coal
and its corresponding char obtained by pyrolysis at 900 °C in a nitro-
gen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C/min.

P(cid:4) Example 1

Fig. 38A represents the evolution of the oxygen demand parame-
ters according to the definitions in Eqs. (14) and (15) as a function of
the carbon fraction in char gasified in the fuel reactor, xchar,FR. In this
example, it is assumed that the gasification products are mostly con-
verted to CO2 and H2O and volatiles are not; that is hcomb,g 1⁄4 1 and
hcomb,v 1⁄4 0.6. As can be observed in Fig. 38A, the value of VFR is
always larger than the value of VT. The value of VFR decreases and
only if there is complete conversion of the fuel fed, VFR reaches the
same value as VT. In contrast, the total oxygen demand VT remains
unaffected and matches the value of the oxygen demand, assuming
that there is complete combustion of the fuel (VT,full) in the full
range of xchar,FR. Therefore, in this case, the total oxygen demand
(VT) provides a better representation of what would be expected at
high solid fuel conversions.

P(cid:4) Example 2

A different situation arises when better volatile combustion is
assumed. In order to show how hcomb,v and hcomb,g affect the rela-
tionship between VFR and VT, the exact opposite situation to exam-
ple 1 is assumed and shown in Fig. 38C. Thus, hcomb,v 1⁄4 1 and a value
of hcomb,g 1⁄4 0.9 is taken for the efficiency of the combustion of the
volatiles and char gasification products, respectively. As can be seen,
the oxygen demand in the fuel reactor (VFR) is again larger than the
total oxygen demand (VT), as both parameters increase when the
carbon fraction in char being gasified in the fuel reactor increases,
and both values converge when full carbon conversion of the fuel
introduced is reached (xchar,FR 1⁄4 1). According to Fig. 38C, the oxygen
demand in the fuel reactor (VFR) is closer to the real oxygen demand
value if there is complete conversion of the fuel (indicated by dashed
lines), especially when more than 70% of the char introduced has
been converted in the fuel reactor.

P(cid:4) Example 3

Nevertheless, existing facilities had other configurations with
intermediate behavior regarding hcomb,v and hcomb,g. Fig. 38B shows
the values for VFR and VT versus the carbon fraction in char being

gasified in the fuel reactor for the case in which hcomb,v 1⁄4 0.8 and
hcomb,g 1⁄4 0.9. Here, the oxygen demand in the fuel reactor (VFR) and
the total oxygen demand (VT) show opposite trends. Neither of the
oxygen demand values calculated would be representative of what
could be expected in a larger CLC system. The values of VFR decrease
with the increase in xchar,FR and they are always higher than the real
value expected in optimized systems. In contrast, the values of VT
increase with xchar,FR, but they always underpredict the value
expected with full conversion of the fuel. However, again this final
value is the same for both definitions of the oxygen demand when
xchar,FR is equal to unity.

PFrom the analysis in Fig. 38, several conclusions can be drawn:

Pi) The total oxygen demand (VT) is always lower than the opti-
mum or equal values when xchar,FR < 1. In addition, the total oxy-
gen demand always has a linear dependency with xchar,FR, which
makes it easier to extrapolate xchar,FR to a value equal to 1 from
experimental results.

Pii) If xchar,FR < 1, an increase or decrease of VFR can be expected,
depending on the hcomb,v and hcomb,g values. Only when hcomb,v
and hcomb,g are equal, would the oxygen demand value in the
fuel reactor, VFR be the same as the oxygen demand with com-
plete conversion of the fuel. Thus, it seems that the total oxygen
demand (VT) is a friendlier parameter to show the performance
of the CLC process in order to compare it with model predictions
and the performance of other combustion processes, such as
oxyfuel combustion. Thus, the use of the total oxygen demand
concept (VT) to represent the performance of CLC is highly rec-
ommended.

Piii) The values of the combustion efficiency of the volatiles released
(hcomb,v) and the combustion efficiency of the gasification prod-
ucts (hcomb,g) vary notably depending on the combustion condi-
tions and configuration of the CLC unit and, therefore, they
should be determined specifically for each unit. The procedure to
determine hcomb,v and hcomb,g is shown in the following section.

5.1. Determination of the combustion efficiency of volatiles and char
gasification products (hcomb,v and hcomb,g) from experimental results

PAccording to Eq. (14) and (15), the value of the oxygen demand
with complete conversion of the fuel can be estimated once the
value of the combustion efficiency of the volatiles released (hcomb,v)
and char gasification products (hcomb,g) are known. Some attempts

Pto estimate the contribution to the oxygen demand of unconverted
volatiles released by coal and char gasification products have already
been reported in the literature [121,136].

POne of the possible ways to estimate both contributions to the
oxygen demand is to perform experiments under similar conditions
with a coal and its corresponding char produced separately [136].
The difference between this oxygen demand (Vchar) and the value
obtained in the combustion of the coal (VT) is then attributed to the
oxygen demand associated with the combustion of the volatiles
(Vvol). Once these two contributions have been estimated, the values
of hcomb,v and hcomb,g can be calculated. This type of experiment was
performed by Cuadrat et al. [136] in the 0.5 kWth unit at ICB-CSIC
using ilmenite as the oxygen carrier and “El Cerrej(cid:1)on” bituminous
coal as fuel. In this case, the fuel reactor was a bubbling fluidized
bed. These authors concluded that, by using ilmenite, the gasification
products were highly oxidized (hcomb,g (cid:5) 1) and calculated the corre-
sponding value for hcomb,v 1⁄4 0.61. Nevertheless, some concerns
about the accuracy of this methodology may arise from the fact that
the nature of the char fed is not the same as the char produced in
situ in the fuel reactor and, therefore, the reactivity of the char could
be different.

PTo avoid these possible discrepancies, other attempts included
stopping the coal feed at a certain time and then evaluating the oxy-
gen demand under the same experimental conditions. This oxygen
demand would only be attributed to that of the char gasification
products (Vchar) being released by the char remaining in the CLC
unit. This type of experiment was performed by Linderholm et al.
[121] in the 100 kWth unit at CUT using ilmenite as an oxygen carrier
and “El Cerrej(cid:1)on” bituminous Colombian coal as fuel. In this case, the
fuel reactor was a circulating fluidized bed. According to these
authors, about one half of the oxygen demand could be attributed to
unconverted volatile matter.

PIn this paper, the calculation of the combustion efficiency of the
volatiles released (hcomb,v) and char gasification products (hcomb,g) is
based on the experimental results already reported in the literature
for the various types of CLC units burning solid fuels. hcomb,v and
hcomb,g are determined based on Eqs. (14) and (15). The following
expression can be deduced:
V

ð1(cid:1)xchar;FR
þ ð1(cid:1)hcomb;g
PThe linearization of this expression as shown in Eq. (17) enables
determination of the combustion efficiency of the volatiles released
(hcomb,v) and char gasification products (hcomb,g) from the ordinate at
the origin and the slope of the line, respectively, for different values
of the variable xchar,FR, assuming that the values of hcomb,v and hcomb,g

PAmong experimental data gathered in Table 4, only those publi-
cations providing enough information on the solid fuel conversion,
CO2 capture efficiency and oxygen demand were considered, i.e.
mainly publications from ICB-CSIC [101,136(cid:1)141,144,145,198,272]
and CUT [36,37,100,114(cid:1)116,118(cid:1)124]. In both cases, the CLC con-
figurations used were bubbling or circulating fluidized beds. More-
over, most of the results were obtained using ilmenite as the
oxygen carrier and bituminous coals or petcoke as fuel. Where only
one of the values of oxygen demand was provided, Eq. (18) corre-
lates both values of oxygen demand, i.e. VFR or VT, so that one can
be calculated using the other, provided the value of CO2 capture
efficiency and the ultimate and proximate analysis of the coal are
available [52].

PFig. 39A shows the results obtained in experiments on coal com-
bustion in the 0.5 kWth unit at ICB-CSIC with a bubbling bed fuel
reactor and using either ilmenite or bauxite waste as oxygen
carriers and a “El Cerrej(cid:1)on” bituminous coal as fuel [136,140]. Tem-
perature in the fuel reactor was held constant at 890 °C for experi-
ments with ilmenite [136], and 905 °C for those with bauxite waste
[140], while the solids circulation rate was varied between 2 and
20 kg/h. In this way, the char converted in the fuel reactor was var-
ied by modifying the residence time of solids in the fuel reactor.
As shown in Fig. 39A, the values for hcomb,v and hcomb,g can be
calculated from the fitted line. Table 10 summarizes the results
obtained. As was previously observed by Cuadrat et al. [136] the
combustion efficiency of char gasification products in this CLC unit
is very high.

PIn the 10 kWth unit at CUT, the fuel reactor was also a bubbling
fluidized bed. Fig. 39C shows the results for experiments in the unit
using ilmenite as the oxygen carrier and petcoke and bituminous
coal as fuel [115,119]. During these experiments, the solids circula-
tion and coal feed rates were varied, while temperature was fixed in
the interval 950(cid:1)970 °C. Results were obtained with two different
configurations of the fuel feeding chute: first with solid fuel feed
above-bed and later the feed was modified to have in-bed feed of
the solid fuel. The combustion efficiency values calculated are shown
in Table 10. The initial configuration of this CLC unit enabled high
conversion of volatiles to be reached only if solid fuels with low vola-
tiles were used. This was due to the fact that the above-bed feeding
system helped to prevent most of the volatiles from having the
chance to contact the oxygen carrier particles when released. After
the modification, the solids entered the fuel reactor bed and the
combustion efficiency of volatiles increased. Thus, the conversion of
volatile matter was higher than that found in the 0.5 kWth CLC unit
at ICB-CSIC. However, the conversion of gasification products was
lower in the 10 kWth CLC unit at CUT. The reason for this could be

Pgasification of char particles above the bed, due to the presence of a
carbon stripper in the fuel reactor [36].

PIn other experiments in the 0.5 kWth CLC unit, the temperature in
the fuel reactor was varied in the range 870(cid:1)950 °C and different
coal sizes were used. Fitting curves are shown in Fig. 40. As can be
observed, under these conditions it was not possible to obtain the
values for hcomb,v and hcomb,g because a negative slope was obtained,
which means hcomb,g > 1; see Eq. (17). The change in the fuel reactor
temperature affected both the char gasification rate and the reactiv-
ity of the oxygen carrier and thus the values of hcomb,v and hcomb,g
cannot be considered constant. Therefore, the experimental data
used to evaluate Eq. (17) should always be obtained under similar
conditions (mainly fuel reactor temperature and specific solids
inventory). Results taken from studies in other units also shown in
Fig. 40 led to the same conclusion [122,129,148].

PFig. 39B shows the analysis of experimental data obtained in the
50 kWth unit at ICB-CSIC where the fuel reactor is a circulating fluid-
ized bed [251,285]. Ilmenite was used as the oxygen carrier. The fuel
reactor temperature was in the short range of 970(cid:1)990 °C, the fuel
used was a bituminous coal
(Taldinsky coal), and the solids
circulation rate was around 120 kg/h. The values determined for
hcomb,v and hcomb,g were 0.72 and 0.86, respectively. Compared to
the previous results obtained with ilmenite in the 0.50 kWth unit,
the combustion efficiency of the volatiles was similar, although a
lower specific solids inventory was used in the experiments in the
50 kWth unit. However, the combustion efficiency of gasification
products in the 50 kWth unit was slightly lower because of the H2
and CO generated by char gasificationin the upper part of the reac-
tor, as shown during the fuel reactor modeling [60].

PFig. 39D presents the analysis of the results obtained at the
100 kWth unit at CUT, also with a circulating fluidized bed as the fuel
reactor. In this case, ilmenite was the oxygen carrier and the fuel
was wood char and bituminous coal [120,121]. Temperature in the
fuel reactor was 950(cid:1)1000 °C in all the experiments and the solids
circulation rate was varied. Using ilmenite as an oxygen carrier and
bituminous coal as fuel, the combustion efficiency of gasification
products was similar to that found in the 50 kWth CLC unit at ICB-
CSIC. Modeling results showed that gasification mainly occurs in the
lower part of the reactor, i.e. the dense bed, where oxidation of gasi-
fication products is highly efficient, as was seen with a bubbling

Pfluidized bed fuel reactor [61,286]. However, combustion of volatile
matter was less efficient.

Pfluidized bed [4,244] or a moving bed [53,182] design is preferred to
a bubbling fluidized bed [255].

5.2. Extrapolation of experimental results to optimum conditions for
fuel conversion in the fuel reactor

PFinally, once the values of hcomb,v and hcomb,g have been esti-
mated for a specific configuration and under fixed experimental con-
ditions, they can be used to further estimate the value for the
oxygen demand with complete conversion of the fuel in the fuel
reactor (VT,full) using Eq. (14), i.e. xchar,FR 1⁄4 1. This estimation of the
oxygen demand for full fuel conversion, VT,full can then be used to
evaluate the expected fuel conversion in an optimized CLC unit from
available experimental results in lab- or pilot CLC units. In addition,
the VT,full value can be used to compare the performance of the CLC
configurations already existing. Table 10 shows the values of VT,full
calculated for the CLC units evaluated in Fig. 39. According to these
extrapolated values, similar oxygen demand values could be
expected from both bubbling and circulating fluidized beds. How-
ever, the specific solids inventory used was much lower in CFB,
besides being more easily scalable.

PIt should be taken into account that the validity of the extrapola-
tion method presented in this paper is limited to the assumptions
already made to calculate hcomb,v and hcomb,g. For the same experi-
mental setup, these values can be different for oxygen carriers with
different reactivity. More reactive carriers would be expected to
yield higher values of combustion efficiency.

6. Challenges for the future development of CLC with solid fuels

PA review of experimental data obtained in currently operating iG-
CLC continuous units burning solid fuels has been presented with
the aim of facilitating comparison of the experimental results from
different units and contributing to the optimization of CLC of solid
fuels. There follows a brief discussion on the prospects of the CLC
technology with solid fuels.

6.1. Scale-up of a CLC unit with solid fuels

PThe experience gained from operating these CLC units is very
valuable for evaluating possible ways to optimize the design of a CLC
unit, as well as to identify some milestones to achieve for the scale-
up and future development of this technology.

PIn fact, results obtained in the 3 MWth CLC unit by Alstom Power
[43] replicated the high values of CO2 capture usually obtained at
low scale when an efficient char separation system was used. In
addition, oxygen demands were also similar to those obtained at
lower scales.

PNevertheless, special care should be taken in the CLC design to
prevent a low performance, of which several examples can be found
in the literature. In fact, low CO2 capture efficiency was obtained in
the 1 MWth CLC unit at Darmstadt, due to the lack of a carbon strip-
per; or high oxygen demands as a consequence of an excessively low
solids inventory in the unit [159,287]. In addition, high oxygen
demands were also obtained because of the non-optimized design
for CLC operation in the 4 MWth gasifier at Chalmers [166].

PAll these aspects lead us to define a range of valid conditions for
operation on an industrial scale, such as temperatures of approxi-
mately 1000 °C and solids inventories in the fuel reactor about
500(cid:1)750 kg/MWth. In addition, a good mixing between the solid
fuel and the oxygen carrier is encouraged in order to improve the
conversion of volatile matter and gasification products.

PNowadays, two different approaches are being developed to
scale-up the combustion of solid fuels in a CLC unit. They differ in
the configuration chosen for the fuel reactor. Thus, a circulating

P6.1.1. CLC unit with a circulating fluidized bed as the fuel reactor

PThe fuel reactor can be designed as a circulating fluidized bed
reactor, as in the case of the two largest CLC installations currently
in operation, the 1 and 3 MWth CLC units developed by Alstom Power
[43]. With these, the gas velocity in the fuel reactor is high enough to
allow the entrainment of solids, which also takes place in the air
reactor. Thus, the CLC configuration including two circulating fluid-
ized beds, one as fuel reactor and the other one as air reactor is pre-
ferred at present for the scale-up of CLC. This configuration is more
flexible, scalable and easier to control than other configurations
based on bubbling fluidized beds or moving beds. In addition, expe-
rience gained during coal combustion in circulating fluidized bed
boilers can be significant for the development of CLC technology
with solid fuels [4]. Further considerations presented next mostly
refer to this configuration.

PThe scale-up of the iG-CLC reactors has been done using the
design for either the 1 MWth (TUD) or 3 MWth (Alstom Power USA)
CLC units, mainly based on the presence, or otherwise, of a dedicated
carbon stripper unit. Fig. 41A shows the design for a 100 MWth unit
based on the 1 MWth CLC unit configuration, which includes the car-
bon stripper in the solids stream from the fuel reactor to the air reac-
tor [244]. This option entrains the circulating solids from the fuel
reactor and separates them from the gaseous stream in a cyclone.
The exiting solids include the oxygen carrier and unconverted char
particles. Thus, an external carbon separation system is required so
that the unconverted char does not reach the air reactor. This design
enables control of the operation of the carbon stripper to maximize
the char separation efficiency [145]. The fuel reactor can be designed
solely in terms of both the required amount of solids and the solids
circulation rate. A map for the design of the fuel and air reactor was
presented by Abad et al. [244] based only on fluid dynamics; see
Fig. 42. They concluded that the cross sectional area of both fuel
and air reactor would be around 0.25 m2/MWth. At stoichiometric
conditions, the required solids flow in the reactors would be around
30 kg m2 s¡1, while the pressure drop in the fuel and air reactor
would be 30 and 20 kPa to operate with 750 and 500 kg/MWth in the
fuel and air reactors, respectively.

PThe alternative option for the scale-up to 1000 MWth was
described by Lyngfelt and Leckner [4], based on the existing 3 MWth
CLC unit by Alstom Power [43]. In this design, the bottom part of the
fuel reactor is hydraulically connected to the air reactor, and there-
fore solids from the fuel reactor are extracted by the bottom part of
the reactor; see Fig. 41B. Entrained solids are recirculated to the fuel
reactor. In this option, an in-built carbon stripper is included, so a
section of the fuel reactor is below the coal feeding point, which
functions as a carbon stripper, and operates under conditions that
prevent carbon particles from following the descending stream of
solids.

PThere have been several proposals for boosting the scale-up of
CLC on a commercial scale [250]. The operation of CLC units on an
intermediate scale without purification and storage of CO2 can
reduce the costs during an evaluation period of CLC technology.
Also, retrofitting a circulating fluidized bed to CLC by adding a cou-
pled reactor to the existing one, or constructing a dual fluidized bed
system designed to operate at CLC conditions for a time, and then
operate as a commercial fluidized bed combustor, have been sug-
gested as the most promising ones.

P6.1.2. CLC unit with a moving bed as the fuel reactor

PCLC units at OSU are based on the use of moving bed as the fuel
reactor, and with a thermal power of 2.5 and 25 kWth [153]. In the
moving bed configuration, the oxygen carrier is designed to flow
counter-current to the gas and the coal is fed at an intermediate

Pposition in the reactor; see Fig. 43A. In the upper part (Section 1),
volatile matter and gasification products are converted by gas-solid
reaction with the oxygen carrier, while in the bottom part (Section 2)
enough time is given for the char particles to be gasified. Since
Fe2O3 can be reduced to Fe in a moving bed configuration (see
Section 3.1.7), the oxygen transport capacity of the material is
maximized and the solids circulation rate can be relatively low,
which facilitates the high solids residence time required. In addi-
tion, to ensure that no char enters the air reactor, the gas velocity
at the bottom of the fuel reactor should be higher than the mini-
mum fluidization velocity of the char [53].

PThe fuel reactor must also facilitate good distribution of coal
over the whole of the cross section area. For this purpose, the
design proposed by Schwebel et al. [182] is shown in Fig. 43B.
Coal is fed at mid-height, where the cross section narrows. Thus,
the fuel is fed at a concentrated point with a relatively low cross
section, which increases as the solids drop and coal is distributed
over the whole of the cross section in the bottom part. However,
the cross section of the fuel reactor must be wide enough to
maintain the gas velocity below the minimum fluidization veloc-
ity, umf, of oxygen carrier particles. The scale-up of the moving
bed requires a careful evaluation of the homogeneity of solids
and temperature across the section of the reactor. In addition,
coarse oxygen carrier particles are required, e.g. above 1 mm
diameter, in order to increase umf.

PThe configuration of a fluidized bed connected to a riser is
adopted for the air reactor [53,151]; see Fig. 11. In this case, special
care must be taken with the air reactor design during the scale-up of
the CLC unit, which must allow re-oxidation of the oxygen carrier
particles, while coarse particles are being entrained to elevate them
to the fuel reactor inlet situated in the upper part. The fluidized bed
provides a constant, homogeneous temperature during the exother-
mic oxidation reaction so that sintering and agglomeration problems
are avoided. Next, the particles are entrained in the riser and pneu-
matically conveyed back to the fuel reactor. The cross section in the

Priser should be designed to guarantee sufficient particle transfer to
the fuel reactor [53].

PMoreover, the moving bed could be operated at high pressure,
as there is wide experience in operating pressurized moving bed
gasifiers [288]. In addition, the experience gained in the develop-
ment of syngas chemical looping (SCL), where H2 and electricity
are produced using an iron ore as an oxygen carrier, could be
useful [25].

6.2. Improvement in combustion efficiency of the CLC with solid fuels

PIn view of the results gathered, the main problem encountered in
the operation of iG-CLC units is the existence of unburned com-
pounds at the reactor outlets when interconnected fluidized bed
reactors are used [52,251]. It seems clear that the next step in devel-
opment and further scale-up of iG-CLC technology for solid fuels is
to reduce the unburnt compounds generated. Specific modifications
in the CLC unit can be made to improve the combustion of unburnt
compounds, which could come from either unburnt volatiles or
unburnt gasification products. Knowing the contribution of uncon-
verted volatiles and gasification products to the oxygen demand will
help to improve the performance of the CLC system and propose
new designs that will minimize the oxygen demand; see Section 5.
Thus, several measures have already been undertaken or proposed
to minimize the unburnt compounds, including options to improve
gas-oxygen carrier contact or incorporate new design concepts into
the current scheme of the iG-CLC system; see Fig. 44.

PVienna University of Technology (TUV) proposed a modification
of the fuel reactor in dual fluidized bed systems, intended to maxi-
mize the residence time of solid particles and the contact efficiency
between solid and gaseous phases. The geometry of the fuel reactor
was modified to include wedged-ring-type internals that increased
the total hold-up and homogenized the solids distribution in the
reactor, as shown in option D-1A in Fig. 44 [289,290]. Results
obtained in a cold flow model demonstrated that incorporation of

Pthe internals increases particle concentration in the counter-current
section of the fuel reactor, and that the residence time distribution
of the particles was more symmetrical and had lower dispersion.
Recently, the 50 kWth unit at ICB-CSIC was modified to include this
type of internals in the fuel reactor riser. In experiments performed
after the modification, an improvement in the combustion of
unburned gaseous compounds in the fuel reactor was observed, as
better oxidation of methane and full conversion of hydrogen were
recorded [146].

PAnother modification to the fuel reactor design has been sug-
gested by Lyngfelt and Leckner [4], who proposed and patented a
new design for the fuel feed to the fuel reactor, aimed at avoiding
the local plume of volatiles at the fuel injection point [291]. They
called it a “volatile distributor”, see option D-1B in Fig. 44. It was
described as a box inserted at the bottom of the fuel reactor bed
with the opening downward and holes in the sides. Design details
are still uncertain and have to be optimized using a cold-flow model
and fluid-dynamic models. Once the design is optimized, the impact
on minimizing unburned compounds at the outlet of the fuel reactor
should be evaluated under iG-CLC operating conditions.

PAlternatively, various technological improvements for the iG-CLC
configuration have recently been proposed by Gay(cid:1)an et al. [52]. As
shown in Fig. 44, the alternatives included incorporating a secondary
fuel reactor (D-2), the recirculation of exhaust gases to the fuel reac-
tor (D-3A) or the carbon stripper (D-3B), the separation of CO2 from
unburnt compounds (D-4), or changing the coal feed to the carbon
stripper instead of the fuel reactor (D-5).

PAn attempt to include a secondary fuel reactor has already been
presented by Thon et al. [148]; see Fig. 9 , who divided the fuel

Preactor bed into two bubbling fluidized beds. In the lower bubbling
bed, char gasification took place while in the upper, volatiles and
gasification products were further oxidized by a fresh oxygen carrier.
However, the results did not show such significant improvements in
the oxygen demand as were expected, probably due to the elutria-
tion of unconverted char from the fluidized beds, which is gasified in
the freeboard without coming into contact with the oxygen carrier
particles. Another fact to take into account is that, by incorporating a
secondary fuel reactor, a higher solids inventory is needed in the CLC
system. This should not be an issue if a low-cost oxygen carrier is
used, but a more complex operation would also be expected, since a
new fluidized bed reactor must be connected to those already oper-
ating. Thus, problems with the stability of the solids flow have been
reported, which should be overcome by improving the design and
optimizing operating conditions [179,189].

PThe recirculation of exhaust gases to be further converted in the
fuel reactor or the carbon stripper minimizes the need for steam
generation in either the fuel reactor or the carbon stripper; see
option D-3A and D-3B in Fig. 44. However, the lack of steam avail-
able in the reacting atmosphere could lead to a decrease in char gasi-
fication rate and, therefore, lower CO2 capture efficiency [137,147].
Similarly, Volker and Alfons [292] analyzed different configurations
to remove unburned compounds from the fuel reactor in the tail gas
from the gas processing unit (GPU) using a model; see option D-4 in
Fig. 44. They concluded that post-combustion of these gases after
the fuel reactor with an additional injection of oxygen provided by
an air separation unit (ASU) was the best option when compared to
burning in the air reactor. However, they also indicated that it would
be better to separate the unburned gases from the nitrogen in the

Ptail gas of the GPU by a sorption or membrane process and recycle
them back into the fuel reactor, to increase the overall CO2 capture
efficiency.

PFinally, if the coal is fed to the carbon stripper, this reactor would
be treated as the primary fuel reactor, where a small amount of char
gasification takes place, since char particles are separated from oxy-
gen carrier particles and sent to the fuel reactor, which becomes a
secondary fuel reactor where char gasification takes place and the
coal gases released in the carbon stripper are oxidized; see option
D-5 in Fig. 44.

PThe expected improvement in the oxygen demand for each of the
alternatives was evaluated by Gay(cid:1)an et al. [52], and are included in
Fig. 45. According to the modeling predictions, the largest reduction
in the oxygen demand was obtained if a secondary fuel reactor was
used (option D-2).

PA new configuration for the reactors in the iG-CLC process
was proposed to minimize the oxygen demand; see option D-6
in Fig. 44. Coal is fed into the fuel reactor where volatile matter
and gasification products are partially converted to CO2 and H2O,
with CH4, CO and H2 also present as unburned compounds. Sol-
ids are then transported to the carbon stripper which, in turn,
would be fluidized by hot gases coming from the fuel reactor.
Thus, the carbon stripper would also act as a secondary fuel
reactor. According to the modeling predictions, total oxygen
demand as low as 0.9% would be achievable under this configu-
ration which improves the results obtained in option D-2. How-
ever, further investigation is needed to confirm predictions from
the models experimentally.

PIt should be noted that, although these design modifications con-
tribute to a significant improvement in the oxygen demand, in no
case will full combustion ever be reached [52].

6.3. Oxygen carrier development and scale-up

PRegarding the development of oxygen carriers for the iG-CLC pro-
cess, the focus of research is still expected to be on low cost

Pmaterials, especially Mn-based. The use of synthetic Fe-Mn based
materials for iG-CLC could also be advantageous due to their mag-
netic properties. However, the development of synthetic materials
should be competitive enough to outweigh the benefits of using
low-cost materials that already perform well.

PIn addition, efforts in oxygen carrier development must be
focused on synthetic materials with an oxygen uncoupling capabil-
ity, due to the high combustion efficiency and CO2 capture values
obtained in CLOU mode. Therefore, focusing future research on
CLOU combustion is an interesting option. However, there is a large
gap in the degree of development of this process when compared to
iG-CLC. Most of the CLOU results have been obtained from small
units (up to 10 kWth), while iG-CLC has been largely demonstrated
at MWth scale. Therefore, CLOU should also be demonstrated with
larger scale units, based on circulating fluidized beds. In order to
reach this objective, it is essential to develop new CLOU oxygen car-
riers which maintain chemical properties and mechanical stability
with the redox cycles. It must be remembered that those tested so
far are mostly based on CuO, which is an expensive material, and
none of them has demonstrated a long particle lifetime. This means
that most of the cost of the CO2 capture in CLOU combustion is
attributed to the oxygen carrier. Moreover, the fact that some loss of
oxygen carrier is also expected when draining the solid fuel ashes
adds the need to develop CLOU oxygen carriers with properties that
enable easy recovery.

PThus, an important development in CLOU oxygen carriers is
expected in the near future. Some future research lines can already
be outlined. Besides CuO-based materials, mixed oxides based on
Mn with Cu, Fe, Mg, Si or Ti are being tested to be used as CLOU or
CLaOU oxygen carriers. Cu-Fe and Fe-Mn materials have shown
magnetic properties [79,199] and it was recently found that adding
Ti to Fe-Mn improved the reactivity and magnetism of the oxygen
carriers produced [89]. The magnetic properties found for Fe-Mn-Ti
materials could facilitate separation of the oxygen carrier from the
ashes during solid fuel combustion. Furthermore, a Mn-Cu material
has been identified as a promising oxygen carrier for CLOU [88].

7.1. Thermal integration

PThe overall efficiency in the use of a fuel in a power plant is
affected by the irreversibilities inherent to the combustion process.
In this sense, CLC is an alternative combustion method to decrease
this kind of irreversibility and increase the exergy of the process
[299(cid:1)301]. This effect is highlighted when the reaction in the fuel
reactor is endothermic, thus having a higher temperature in the air
reactor than in the fuel reactor. According to this fact, some redox
systems have been identified from theoretical calculations in order
to operate the air reactor at considerable higher temperature than
the fuel reactor [302], e.g. see CdO, CoO, K2O, Na2O, PbO, SnO2, WO3
or ZnO in Table 11. However, the redox systems linked to these
metal oxides suffer from either low melting point of the reduced or
oxidized form, requirement for too low/high temperature in the
fuel/air reactor, or low equilibrium constant for the oxidation of CO
and H2 to CO2 and H2O. Other metal oxides such as Co3O4 or NiO are
not commonly used in CLC with solid fuels because their high cost
and environmental impact. Both facts affect the drainage of the
ashes generated during solid fuel combustion. The loss of oxygen
carrier during this process would impact the economy of the process
and, on the other hand, toxic elements would be present in the
drained ashes.

PTherefore, in practice, systems based on CaSO4, Fe2O3 or Mn3O4
are mainly used. These systems also present the desired endother-
mic reaction in the fuel reactor to take advantage of the possible
exergy increase; see Table 11. However, the temperature in the fuel
reactor should be as high as possible to improve the coal conversion
and combustion efficiency, thus allowing CO2 capture rates close to
100% [7]; see Section 4.2.2. At the same time, operating conditions
must be carefully selected to avoid a high excess of temperature in
the air reactor. Thus, a temperature about 1000 °C with Fe2O3 or
Mn3O4 is proposed for the fuel reactor temperature, while the tem-
perature increase in the air reactor would be about 50(cid:1)100 °C. Some
lower temperature (950 °C) is allowed for CaSO4 to minimize losses
of sulphur in gases; see Table 11. In addition, the temperature in
both reactors must be precisely controlled for CLOU systems such as
CuO/Cu2O and Mn2O3/Mn3O4 due to thermodynamic considerations
related to the oxidation reaction. In these cases, the global process in
the fuel reactor is exothermic, which is beneficial in order to operate
the fuel reactor at a higher temperature than the air reactor.

PAlthough the CLC capability to increase the exergy in the energy
generation is minimized for practical reasons related to the temper-
atures in air and fuel reactors, CLC has been identified as a combus-
tion method with inherent CO2 capture, which can be relevant in a
future scenery with restricted CO2 emissions to the atmosphere
[303].

PIn any case, the thermal integration between the fuel and air
reactors is a key issue in the design of a CLC unit, both in iG-CLC and
CLOU modes. The usual endothermicity of the fuel reactor in iG-CLC
forces the air reactor to operate at a higher temperature than the
fuel reactor in order to supply the energy required in the fuel reactor
as sensible heat in solids particles. However, the entire process in
the fuel reactor is usually exothermic in CLOU, which facilitates the
energetic integration of the reactors [304]. In addition, it allows
decreasing the temperature of the air reactor below the fuel reactor
temperature which facilitates the oxidation of the oxygen carrier by
thermodynamic considerations [112].

CLC configurations. Adapted from Ref. [52].

PIn order to improve the reliability of the CLOU process, ton-scale
oxygen carriers manufactured industrially should be developed
and the use of the cheapest possible raw materials should also be
encouraged.

6.4. Management of ash in the CLC process with solid fuels

PFinally, ash generation during fuel combustion is another aspect
to be considered in CLC of solid fuels. Two types of ash are generated
in the CLC unit: bottom ashes from particles that remain mixed in
the bed solids, and fly ashes, which are ash particles escaping from
the cyclone exiting the reactors with the exhaust gases. The bottom
ashes remain in the CLC system and accumulate, leading to fluidiza-
tion and operational problems and eventually stopping operation if
the ash content in the fuel reactor exceeds a limit value [293]. There-
fore, ash should be periodically drained, although a certain amount
of oxygen carrier may be lost in the process. Thus, the lifetime of the
oxygen carrier depends on the frequency of ash draining. An estima-
tion of the lifetime of Fe-based oxygen carrier particles as a function
of the fly ash content in the coal was recently presented, which
would affect the cost of oxygen carrier composition [271]. Both sol-
ids in the draining stream and fines collected from a CLC system are
a residue whose disposal should be evaluated [271]. If the oxygen
carrier can be easily separated from ash, e.g. by rotating fluidized
beds [284] or magnetic separation [240], it could be re-used in the
CLC process. This fact is especially relevant for high-cost CLOU
materials.

PMoreover, ashes can interact with the oxygen carrier during solid
fuel combustion. There has recently been research on the reactions
that may take place. The effect of the interaction depends on several
factors, such as the type of oxygen carrier, the nature of the ash
(coal/biomass) and the ash content, as well as operating conditions
in the CLC unit. Most studies in the literature on this aspect concern
Cu-based [294] and especially Fe-based oxygen carriers [269,
295(cid:1)298]. With coal ash, a low ash load seems to decrease the reac-
tivity of Fe-based oxygen carriers [296]; however, if the ash load
increases and the ashes have a high Fe2O3 or CaSO4 content, an
increase in the reactivity of the oxygen carrier is observed, as these
components can act as an oxygen carrier [297]. Recently, experi-
ments performed at TUHH with a coal with high-Na content evalu-
ated the sodium transfer routes in CLC with an iron ore as oxygen
carrier. They concluded that most of the Na present in this type of
coal would be released and converted in the fuel reactor [269]. Pre-
liminary studies on biomass ash indicate the influence of the type of
biomass used as fuel. The presence of silica in the ashes can lead to

PThe thermal integration between fuel and air reactors can be
evaluated by performing mass and enthalpy balances to the CLC
unit. The optimum temperature in each reactor depends on the sol-
ids circulation rate and on the oxygen carrier used. The solids circu-
lation rate affects the temperature difference between the fuel and
air reactors in a similar way to the case of gaseous fuels [209], i.e.
the difference temperature decreases as the solids circulation rate
increases. This fact allows controlling the temperature in the air
reactor if the fuel reactor temperature is fixed. Thus, optimum tem-
peratures in the fuel and air reactors of (cid:5)1000 °C and (cid:5)1045 °C have
been suggested for Fe-based oxygen carriers [244], while the opti-
mum temperature when using a Ni-based oxygen carrier was about
900(cid:1)950 °C and 1050(cid:1)1150 °C, respectively [305]. In the CLOU pro-
cess with Cu-based oxygen carriers the optimum temperature in
fuel reactor would be about 900(cid:1)950 °C, while temperature in the
air reactor would be in the 850(cid:1)900 °C interval [306,307].

PThe heat released in a CLC unit must be used to produce steam,
which can be used as a heating medium or to produce electricity
using turbines in a steam cycle. Besides that generated inside the air
reactor, heat is also available in the high temperature gaseous
streams from the fuel and air reactors. A fraction of this enthalpy can
be used to preheat the inlet streams to the CLC systems such as air,
steam or CO2. If steam is used to fluidize the fuel reactor in the iG-
CLC process, Abad et al. [244] concluded that the sensible heat in
flue gases only represents about 45% of the total thermal energy in
the fuel. This value was calculated from Fig. 46a considering the
enthalpies entering the system with the inlet streams. Another frac-
tion (»32%) must be extracted from the solids, usually considered
from oxidized oxygen carrier due to the high exothermicity of the
oxidation reaction. Heat from oxidized solids could be extracted in
an external heat exchanger, which would allow operating at a low
gas velocity in a non-corrosive environment for the cooling surfaces.
Thus, the heat management is a crucial issue to maintain the desired
temperature in the fuel and air reactors. In addition, a relevant frac-
tion of the available heat (»23%) is found as latent heat, which
would be recovered during steam condensation at low temperature.
The use of recirculated CO2 as fluidizing gas can contribute to

Pincrease the enthalpy available as sensible heat in the gaseous
streams up to »65%, while the required heat extracted from the air
reactor and the latent heat in steam from the fuel reactor decreases
to 29 and 6%, respectively; see Fig. 46b.

PIn the CLOU process the thermal integration is influenced by the
fact that both air and fuel reactors are exothermic. Thus lower tem-
peratures are necessary and recirculated CO2 can be used as fluidiza-
tion agent in the fuel reactor instead of steam. Thus, the difference
in temperature between fuel and air reactors can be varied by tuning
the heat extracted from fuel and air reactors in the CLOU unit. The
temperature in fuel and air reactors can be fixed to 950 and 850 °C,
respectively, by extracting most heat (58%) from the air reactor
[306,307]; but these temperatures can be matched to 900 °C if heat
extracted from the air reactor was decreased to 31% which requires
that the fraction of fuel thermal power extracted from the fuel reac-
tor was 22%.

PIn addition, the steam to carbon ratio in the iG-CLC process and
the air to fuel ratio, both in iG-CLC and CLOU, have been identified as
a relevant parameter influencing the enthalpy balance in the system.
On the one hand, the energy required in the fuel reactor increased
with the steam to carbon ratio, which involves a higher circulation
of solids to maintain the enthalpy balance in the system [305]. On
the other hand, it must be considered that the heat extracted from
the solids decreases as the air to fuel ratio increases [306].

7.2. Net energy efficiency

PThe enthalpy balance in a CLC unit is directly related to the
achievable net efficiency. Both in iG-CLC and CLOU, the net electrical
efficiency, including CO2 compression and oxygen production for
the oxygen polishing step when required, has been calculated to be
35(cid:1)36% for super critical steam cycle [191,308] and 41(cid:1)42% consid-
ering ultra-super critical plants [309(cid:1)313]. Recently, the net electric
efficiency of a power plant based on CLOU has been estimated in the
46(cid:1)48% interval for coal, lignite and sawdust, while the CO2 capture
rate was above 99% [314]. In this case the oxygen polishing step
is not required. No clear reasons were argued to justify these high

PCLC technologies with coal compared to a conventional power plant
without CO2 capture is usually estimated in 2(cid:1)3 percentage points
with the capability to capture more than 95% of the CO2 avoided. But
for other CO2 capture technologies the energy penalty is estimated
in the 7(cid:1)9 percentage points interval. Note that in these cases the
CO2 avoided is lower than CLC, with values about 90%. For ultra-
super critical conditions, the net efficiency values for post-combus-
tion with amines, pre-combustion or oxy-combustion technologies
are in the range of 34(cid:1)35%, 34(cid:1)36%, and 34(cid:1)37%, respectively.

PThe use of pressurized CLC units would represent an improve-
ment in the net efficiency by using a combined cycle to produce elec-
tricity. In this case, coal can be used in two ways in CLC: (i)
integrating the ex-situ pressurised gasification of coal with oxygen
with a CLC unit (IGCC-CLC); and (ii) the in-situ conversion of fuel by
a direct feeding of coal in the pressurised CLC unit, such as in the iG-
CLC and CLOU processes. From an energetic point of view, the coal
direct CLC is preferred because the energy penalty for oxygen pro-
duction is avoided. If a combined cycle is incorporated and the air
reactor is operated at high temperature, the estimated net efficiency
oscillates between 39(cid:1)41% and 45(cid:1)50% for IGCC-CLC and pressure
iG-CLC, respectively [315,316]. Compared to conventional
IGCC
power plants without CCS, no differences in the net efficiency were
estimated for iG-CLC, while the energy penalty was in the 7(cid:1)9%
interval for IGCC with CO2 capture [315]. Nevertheless, a high tem-
perature in the turbine is required to take advantage of the com-
bined cycle. For example, having the air reactor temperature at 1050
and 1200 °C the net efficiency was estimated to be 46% and 49.6%,
respectively [316,317]. Note that the state of the art in the oxygen
carrier development would allow temperatures about 1000(cid:1)1100 °
C in the operation of an oxygen carrier for solid fuel combustion.
However, CLOU materials cannot be oxidized at such high tempera-
ture, and the maximum temperature is limited to 900(cid:1)1000 °C.
Therefore, pressurized CLC operation would involve a limited
increase in the net efficiency of the power plant due to the limited
temperature of the reactors which also affects to the efficiency of
the gas turbine [312,318].

PIn addition, some specific characteristics of a CLC unit with solid
fuels can affect to the overall efficiency of the system such as the air
excess ratio, the pressure drop in the reactors, the steam to carbon
ratio and the necessity of an oxygen polishing step specifically for
iG-CLC.

PAn increase in the air excess ratio of 10% would decrease the net
electric efficiency in 0.05(cid:1)0.13 percentage points, depending on the
pressure drop in the air reactor [310,319]. Thus, an increase in the
pressure drop of 10 kPa in air reactor decreased the net electric effi-
ciency by 0.3 [4] or 0.5 percentage points [319]. Similar increases in
the fuel reactor pressure drop decreased the efficiency only by
0.05(cid:1)0.1 percentage points [319]. In this sense, the better perfor-
mance of the CLOU process compared to iG-CLC burning a solid fuel
makes that a lower amount of solids where required for CLOU.
Therefore, the energy required to fluidize particles in CLOU is lower
than the corresponding energy spent in iG-CLC [112].

PRegarding the steam to coal ratio, this factor is highly sensitive
for iG-CLC; note that the CLOU process does not require steam as
gasifying agent. Thus, the H2O/C ratio has been identified as a rele-
vant parameter affecting the net electric efficiency in iG-CLC. A
decrease of 1.3% when the steam to coal mass ratio was increased
from 1 to 1.5, corresponding to values of steam to fixed carbon molar
ratio of H2O/Cfix 1⁄4 1.2(cid:1)1.8 was reported [319]. Therefore, a low H2O/
Cfix ratio is preferred. Shen et al. [305] and Lyngfelt and Leckner [4]
selected values of the H2O/Cfix ratio in the 0.4(cid:1)0.5 range. Note that
in this process it is possible to fully gasify the coal with H2O/Cfix
molar ratios below 1 because H2O is continuously formed during the
combustion of gasification products by the oxygen carrier. Indeed,
no significant effect was observed during coal combustion when the
H2O/Cfix ratio was experimentally decreased below 1 in a CLC unit

critical plant without CCS (43%).

P[138]. Also, the efficiency would be increased if hot exhaust recycled
gases were used as fluidizing media [310], which is not problematic
for CLOU [199], although CO2 capture could be affected for iG-CLC if
less reactive CO2 was used instead steam as fluidizing and gasifying
agent [137,138,140]. The efficiency penalty has been estimated in
0.8% when only steam is used for fluidization of the fuel reactor. This
value could decrease to 0.2% if “hot CO2” was recirculated [4].

PIn addition, complete combustion in the fuel reactor is not found
in iG-CLC mode, which requires the use of an oxygen polishing step.
An increase in the oxygen demand of 5% would only represent a
decrease in the net electric efficiency of 0.2(cid:1)0.3% [4,292]. In order to
decrease the oxygen requirements for this oxygen polishing some
technological solutions have been evaluated, including the use of a
secondary fuel reactor or the recirculation of flue gases, which would
allow an increase in the net efficiency of the whole iG-CLC process
[52].

PIn addition of the applicability of CLC to a power plant, CLC tech-
nology can be also considered for steam generation. In this case, the
steam produced by CLOU is about 15% higher than that produced by
iG-CLC because the steam requirement for the fuel reactor is avoided
[320].

PFinally, it should be remarked that the lower energetic penalty of
CLC compared to other CO2 capture technologies has a direct impact
on lower fuel requirements. This fact has been identified as a funda-
mental issue in order to identify the CLC with coal as a technology
with a considerably lower environmental impact than other CO2
capture technologies [321].

7.3. Cost of CO2 capture by CLC

PThe relatively low energy penalty for the CLC process compared
to other CO2 capture technologies benefits the economy of CLC
regarding the electricity and CO2 costs. Thus, CLC was identified by
the CCP (CO2 Capture Project) among the best alternatives to reduce
the economic cost of CO2 capture [322]. Moreover, the IPCC in their
special report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage identified CLC
as one of the cheapest technologies for CO2 capture [323]. It is of
high relevance the capability of CLC to achieve capture rates close to
100% when solid fuels are considered, which are very difficult to
reach by other CO2 capture technologies [7,35,301].

PRegarding the CO2 capture cost there is a variability of data. The
EU project “Enhanced Capture of CO2” (ENCAP) concluded that the
incremental in the electricity cost was lower than the calculated for
other technologies of CO2 capture [191]. Taken as a reference a pulv-
erised fuel fired power plant without CO2 capture using bituminous
coal as fuel, the increase in the electricity generation cost for an iG-
CLC plant was about 12(cid:1)22%. The estimated cost of the capture was
6(cid:1)13 €/ton CO2 avoided for CLC. The same study estimated
18(cid:1)37 €/ton CO2 avoided for a pre-combustion technology using
IGCC, and 13(cid:1)30 €/ton CO2 avoided for an oxy-fuel process. In a
recent work, the cost of the avoided CO2 for CLOU was estimated in
24(cid:1)27 €/ton, which is also lower than the CO2 cost in reference
power plant with solid fuels (35(cid:1)60 €/ton) [312].

PLyngfelt and Leckner [4] evaluated the additional cost and effi-
ciency penalty of a CLC unit with coal including CO2 compression
compared to the reference cost of coal combustion in a circulating
fluidized bed boiler. They identified the cost associated to the oxy-
gen carrier and the oxygen polishing step as the major contributors
to the CO2 capture cost in a iG-CLC process. Thus, the oxygen carrier
would contribute with 1.3(cid:1)4 €/tonne CO2, while the oxygen polish-
ing step will add a cost of 4(cid:1)9 €/tonne CO2. The total cost would be
16(cid:1)26 €/tonne CO2 avoided, including CO2 compression.

PThe additional cost related to the oxygen carrier depends on the
price of the oxygen carrier (materials, particles production, calcina-
tion, etc.), the lifetime of particles, solids inventory in the CLC unit
and the ratio of the oxygen carrier being recovered [324]. But in the

Pworst case scenario, i.e. low lifetime and relatively high cost of the
oxygen carrier, the cost of the oxygen carrier is easily below 5% of
the assumed yearly operational cost. Then, the oxygen carrier cost
would not be a showstopper for the development of the CLC technol-
ogy, being highly competitive compared to other CO2 capture tech-
nologies as, for example, the oxy-fuel case. For example, the cost of
the oxygen carrier could add 3.3 € per ton CO2 avoided considering a
price of the oxygen carrier of 1500 €/ton, a solids inventory of
1500 kg/MWth, a lifetime of 1250 h and a recovery factor of 50%
[324].

PThe levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the iG-CLC process in
the USA market has been estimated in the range 105(cid:1)120 $/MWh,
which represents an increase of »20 $/MWh compared to the LCOE
for conventional power plants without CO2 capture, and lower than
the cost for the DOE base case for post-combustion CO2 capture with
amines (132.5 $/MWh) or oxy-combustion (158 $/MWh) [191,308].
Thus, the CLC with coal complies by far with the DOE goal of 90%
capture with an increase of the electricity cost of 35%. For CLOU with
solid fuels in the EU market, the LCOE was estimated to be in the
84(cid:1)92 €/MWh interval, which are lower than the cost for other CCS
technologies (90(cid:1)110 €/MWh) [312].

PIn addition, the electricity production by CLC with coal can
become highly competitive if the CO2 market fixes a relatively
high price [325]. For example, in the German scenario with a CO2
allowances of 50 €/ton, the electricity production cost can be
40(cid:1)45 €/MWh for CLC, which can be compared to 50 €/MWh for the
oxy-fuel case or 65 €/MWh for a reference case without CCS. This
low price would boost the hours of peak load operation of power
plant based on CLC technology.

8. Highlights on the future research of CLC with solid fuels

PDuring the last decade, a firm base has been achieved in the
development of CLC for solid fuels. Thus, the main concerns on fuel
conversion and environmental issues have been analyzed in depth
from experimental results in CLC units ranging from 0.5 kWth to
4 MWth. Research on coal combustion in CLC will be relevant in the
coming years, as this fuel will play a significant part in the mix of
energy production in the near future. In addition, there have been
encouraging results on biomass-fueled CLC, which remains one of
the BECCS technologies with a good chance of achieving negative
CO2 emissions.

PThe scale-up of the CLC process should include the experience
gained to date on aspects such as design, operating conditions and
oxygen carrier development.

PMost of the experience has been gained in plants including inter-
connected fluidized bed systems, but a moving bed used as fuel reac-
tor also returned interesting results.

PThe combustion technology based on CFB at atmospheric pres-
sure is already mature. Retrofitting a circulating fluidized bed to CLC
by adding a coupled reactor to the existing one is seen as a promising
option in the next stage of the scale-up process. For the energy gen-
eration sector, Pressurized Chemical Looping Combustion coupled
with a Combined Cycle (PCLC-CC) has been identified as an interest-
ing option to increase the energy efficiency of CLC of solid fuels,
although possible damage to the turbine caused by solid fines elutri-
ated from the CFB should be taken into account.

PThe iG-CLC process mainly focuses on the use of low-cost materi-
als, generally based on minerals or industrial residues containing Fe
and Mn. Temperatures about 1000 °C and a solids inventory up to
1000 kg/MWth were desirable to reach high CO2 capture efficiencies.
In addition, the presence of a highly efficient carbon stripper was a
decisive factor in obtaining CO2 capture efficiency close to 100%.
Nevertheless, unburned compounds have always been found at the
outlet of the fuel reactor, which makes an oxygen polishing step nec-
essary.

PThe use of more reactive oxygen carriers leads to a decrease
in the oxygen demand, but the improvements were not sufficient
to avoid oxygen polishing. Improved design, such as the use of a
secondary fuel reactor, could lead to a significant reduction in
oxygen demand requirements. However, complete combustion of
solid fuel cannot be expected from these technological solutions
alone. Alternatively, a moving bed fuel reactor would solve this
problem, although other design challenges in the scale-up have
to be overcome.

PThe development of synthetic materials with oxygen uncoupling
(CLOU) capability is an alternative to the low-cost materials used in
iG-CLC. Excellent results both in CO2 capture and combustion effi-
ciencies have been obtained with Cu-based materials. Mn-based
materials (Fe-Mn or Ca-Mn) with some oxygen uncoupling capabil-
ity (CLaOU) open up an opportunity to use lower cost materials. A
key factor in the scale-up of synthetic oxygen carriers is their life-
time, thus, development of long-life oxygen carriers will be a subject
of future research.

PMoreover, the loss of oxygen carrier in the purge ash stream is
important in any solid-fueled CLC, especially for coals with high ash
content. A separation process, possibly based on various fluid
dynamics or magnetic properties, is needed to recover the oxygen
carrier from the ash mix. Developing oxygen carrier materials for
the purpose, based on Fe-Mn oxides with magnetic properties,
remains attractive.

PTo boost the scale-up of CLC at the commercial scale, confi-
dence in the use of oxygen carrier materials with solid fuels
must be guaranteed; therefore, experience gained in the use of
oxygen carrier particles as bed material in a fluidized bed com-
bustor working under OCAC conditions will be very valuable.
Thus, determination of the lifetime of oxygen carrier under cer-
tain conditions and the ageing of the particles in the presence of
ash components are relevant aspects useful for further develop-
ment of solid-fueled CLC.

PConsidering the results obtained in CLC of solid fuels, its imple-
mentation on a commercial scale is a solid option in a CO2 restricted
scenario and has special advantages if using biomass. In addition to
the energy generation sector, a market search identified paper,
cement and other end-users requiring industrial boilers, as an inter-
esting niche which could be early adopters of CLC.
