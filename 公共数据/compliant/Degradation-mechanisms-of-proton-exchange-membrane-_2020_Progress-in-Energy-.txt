The proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is an ideal automotive power source with great potential, 
owing to its high eﬃciency and zero emissions. However, the durability and life-span limit its large-scale 
application. Complex automotive operating conditions signiﬁcantly accelerate fuel cell aging, and result in 
diverse degradation mechanisms that require comprehensive understanding. This review focuses on three 
harsh conditions of open-circuit/idling, dynamic load, and startup-shutdown. In-situ and ex-situ accel- 
erated stress tests (ASTs) for the three conditions are summarized in terms of methodology, research 
objectives, and conditions of application. Reversible decay may arise during ASTs and lead to an over- 
estimation of the aging state, of which the causes and recovery procedures are emphasized. The degrada- 
tion mechanisms are elaborated systematically according to parameter characteristics, microstructure, and 
aging reactions. First, increased gas permeation and a high cathode potential during open-circuit/idling 
combine to intensify generation of free radicals that cause membrane degradation. Pt degradation and mi- 
gration are also accelerated, characterized by increased Pt particle growth and precipitation in the mem- 
brane. The debate regarding the effect of Pt precipitation on membrane degradation is resolved based on 
a literature review. Second, dynamic load brings about changes in the thermal/humidity state, altered re- 
actant demand, and potential cycling, which lead to mechanical degradation, gas starvation, and Pt parti- 
cle growth, respectively. To account for the accelerated particle growth, electrochemical Ostwald ripening 
and increased Pt dissolution are reviewed. Third, an air/hydrogen boundary appears in the anode un- 
der startup-shutdown condition and causes carbon corrosion in the local cathode via the reverse current 
mechanism. The cathode thereby suffers from severe and non-uniform structural damage and even struc- 
tural collapse, accompanied by Pt agglomeration and detachment. Meanwhile, diﬃculties in mass transfer 
arise because of ionomer redistribution, decreased porosity, and carbon surface hydrophilization. In ad- 
dition, cold start produces severe damage to component structures. This paper seeks to guide further 
investigation into improved fuel cell durability via mechanism analysis, condition optimization, control 
strategy development, structural design of the membrane electrode assembly, and component material 
development.

1. Introduction 

The threatening circumstances of resource shortages and envi- 
ronmental pollution have led to increasing demand for clean and 
renewable sources of energy. Overconsumption of fossil fuels has 
accelerated global warming due to massive emission of greenhouse 
gases including carbon dioxide (CO 
2 ). Hydrogen, which is available 
2 O) as a reaction prod- 
from many sources and yields only water (H 
uct, is an ideal pollution-free and carbon-free fuel [ 1 , 2 ]. The proton 
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, which uses hydrogen to gen- 
erate electricity, has attracted widespread attention because of its 
high eﬃciency, high power density, low operating temperature and 
zero emissions [ 3 , 4 ]. The composition and operating principle of a 
PEM fuel cell are shown in Fig. 1 . The PEM fuel cell is also suitable 
for  vehicle  use  and  is  regarded  as  a  promising  power  source  to 
replace the internal combustion engine in the future [ 5 , 6 ]. How- 
ever, high cost and poor durability currently hinder its commer- 
cialization [7-13] . The United States Department of Energy (DOE) 
has set 5,0 0 0 h and 40,0 0 0 h by 2020 as lifetime goals for trans- 
portation and stationary applications, respectively, with a perfor- 
mance degradation of less than 10% [ 8 , 9 , 11 ]. The ultimate durabil- 
ity target for fuel cells in vehicle use is 8,0 0 0 h [8] . For station- 
ary applications, Verhage et al. [14] reported a 70 kW PEM fuel 
cell system with hydrogen supplied from a chlorine factory, which 
reached an operating time of 30,0 0 0 h in 2013. Smit et al. [10] es- 
timated a 40,0 0 0 h lifetime of their improved stationary PEM fuel 
cell, which had been in failure-free operation for more than 16,0 0 0 
h by 2014. However, the 5,0 0 0 h lifetime target of vehicle fuel cells 
still seems challenging. The considerable difference in lifetime be- 
tween stationary and transportation fuel cells is attributed to sig- 
niﬁcantly different operating conditions other than the inherently 
different designs for these two applications. Fuel cells in vehicle 
use are faced with harsh conditions, including open-circuit voltage 
(OCV) holding, idling, dynamic load, startup-shutdown, full-power 
running, overload, and freezing-thawing [15-25] . It is important to 
understand the impact of these conditions and the mechanisms in- 
volved. 

The decay in performance of PEM fuel cells under automotive 
conditions has been studied extensively. Several test protocols have 
been  developed  to  evaluate  the  durability  and  lifespan  of  vehi- 
cle fuel cells [ 19 , 26 ]. The protocols, which are based on realistic 
road conditions and driving habits [ 19 , 22 , 26 ] or are derived from 

pre-existing driving cycles [ 19 , 27 , 28 ], address idling, dynamic load, 
startup-shutdown,  and  overload  conditions.  These  issues  lead  to 
variations  in  the  internal  physical  and  chemical  parameters  and 
to  the  subsequent  degradation  of  output  performance.  Pei  et  al. 
[15] proposed a rapid lifetime evaluation method analogous to cu- 
mulative fatigue damage theory, in which the total decay rate is 
treated as a linear combination of decay rates produced by differ- 
ent conditions. The lifetime formula is: 

f =

is an accelerating coeﬃcient related to factors such as gas quality 
difference, P

load changing, startup-shutdown, idling, and the high power con- 
ditions, respectively, n 
2 are the related cycle times, and t 
3 
and t 
4 are the operating time under speciﬁc conditions. Pei et al. 
[15] also evaluated the effect of the above four conditions based 
on  the  driving  cycle  of  a  fuel  cell  bus.  Load  changing,  startup- 
shutdown,  idling,  and  high  power  operation  contributed  56.5%, 
33.0%, 4.7%, and 5.8%, respectively, to performance degradation. In 
addition, idling, dynamic load, and startup-shutdown have been re- 
ported to represent 28%, 44%, and 28%, respectively, of the fuel cell 
lifetime in a light vehicle [29] . The impact of these automotive con- 
ditions has been conﬁrmed in the literature [ 16 , 22 , 30-33 ]. Apart 
from high power condition, operating circumstances and their ef- 
fect on durability have been widely studied. Fuel cell literature has 
concentrated on mass transfer and the internal water and thermal 
state under high power condition, because of the increased risks of 
gas starvation [ 34 , 35 ], water ﬂooding [36-38] , and local overheat- 
ing  [ 35 , 39 , 40 ].  However,  research  focusing  on  durability  at  high 
power condition is limited. Zhang et al. [18] reported that hot spot 
formation tend to occur in this situation, which accelerates chem- 
ical degradation of the membrane and sintering of the Pt catalyst. 
Accordingly, this review will not consider the high power condition 
separately. Besides, fuel cells maintain a high potential of 0.85-1.0 
V under OCV and idling, where the principal degradation mecha- 
nisms are the same. Therefore, we highlight the open-circuit/idling, 
dynamic load, and startup-shutdown conditions shown in Fig. 1 , 
which compose the typical automotive operating conditions.

Fuel cell output performance and durability depend on the in- 
herent state of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the 
polar  plate,  as  well  as  the  operating  state,  such  as  the  internal 
water  and thermal states.  The MEA,  which comprises the mem- 
brane,  catalyst  layer  (CL),  and  gas  diffusion  layer  (GDL),  is  cru- 
cial, because the operating state affect the durability by degrad- 
ing the MEA. Even for the metal bipolar plate, released metal ions 
degrade performance by contaminating the MEA and accelerating 
component degradation [41-43] . An increase in contact resistance, 
which originates from corrosion and passivation of the metal bipo- 
lar plate, also contributes to performance decay [ 41 , 42 , 44 , 45 ], thus 
requiring surface treatment or coating [ 46 , 47 ]. Research studying 
irreversible degradation of the MEA has focused on the perﬂuori- 
nated sulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane, the ionomer in the CL, the 
Pt catalyst, and the carbon support [ 22 , 4 8 , 4 9 ]. Degradation is char- 
acterized  by  material  aging  and  loss,  and  a  change  in  morphol- 
ogy and microstructure of the components. Generally, the mem- 
brane can experience aging from thermal, mechanical, and chem- 
ical effects [ 48 , 50-52 ]. Thermal load accelerates decomposition of 
the molecular structure, of which the degradation induced by hot 
spots is typical. Mechanical aging involves cracks and pinholes in 
the membrane resulting from mechanical factors, such as frequent

shrinking-swelling  during  dry-wet  cycles.  Attack  by  free  radicals 
results  in  chemical  degradation  [43] .  Membrane  degradation  in- 
creases hydrogen permeability and decreases the ionic conductiv- 
ity. Corrosion of the carbon support is accelerated at high poten- 
tial. The Pt catalyst experiences complicated degradative processes 
in a fuel cell, including dissolution, re-deposition, Ostwald ripen- 
ing,  agglomeration,  sintering,  and  detachment  [53-56] .  The  elec- 
trochemical surface area (ECSA) decreases during these processes. 
The analysis of components, reaction products, microstructure, and 
morphology, can help clarify the origins and mechanisms of aging. 
Admittedly, previous reviews [ 21 , 24 , 57-59 ] have adequately sum- 
marized the degradation modes of fuel cell components. However, 
there is an urgent need to comprehensively understand the multi- 
ple aspects of degradation processes and consequences under var- 
ious conditions, due to the fact that operating conditions greatly 
shorten the lifetime of automotive fuel cells. In recent years, the 
research on the fuel cell aging process is strengthened concerning 
various conditions and inﬂuencing factors, by means of in-situ and 
ex-situ  durability  tests,  specially-designed  fuel  cells  and  appara- 
tus, advanced characterization methods, and modeling approaches. 
The accelerated stress test (AST) method has been developed and 
standardized with increasing effectiveness. Speciﬁc improvements 
in component material and structure and some mitigation strate- 
gies have been proposed and validated in the literature. Based on 
these progresses, we believe that our review will contribute sig- 
niﬁcantly to overcoming the durability problem of automotive fuel 
cells.compose the typical automotive operating conditions. 

This  paper  seeks  to  provide  a  comprehensive  review  of  PEM 
fuel  cell  degradation  mechanisms  under  typical  automotive  op- 
erating  conditions,  including  open-circuit/idling,  dynamic  load, 
and startup-shutdown. The AST method, performance degradation 
characteristics, and decay of key parameters are all analyzed. Time- 
dependent changes in components, microstructure, and morphol- 
ogy under typical operating conditions are highlighted. Some con- 
troversies in durability research are also discussed. This paper pro- 
vides a fundamental basis for designing a the highly-durable MEA,

The  output  performance  of  the  PEM  fuel  cell  is  governed  by 
different  overpotentials,  including  the  charge  transfer  overpoten- 
tial ( ηact ), the ohmic overpotential ( η
ohm ), and the concentration 
overpotential ( ηcon ) [ 29 , 60-65 ]. The overpotentials and their mod- 
els are presented in Fig. 2 . Here, E

There is a deviation, η

tual situation in the fuel cell. In fact, the electrode potential of a 
fuel cell is a mixed electrode potential, which is affected by the 
permeation of H 
2 O, short-circuiting, and gas and mate- 
rial purity. Among the factors, gas permeation and short-circuiting 
have important consequences and have been treated accordingly 
[ 60-62 , 65 ]. Here, η

The  overpotential  formulas  in  Fig.  2  are  mainly  derived  from 
the Tafel equation with simplifying assumptions [ 62 , 65 ]. The Tafel

formance.  Researchers  have  attempted  to  modify  the  overpoten- 
tial  formulas to  approximate actual  fuel cell  conditions.  Jouin et 
al. [ 29 , 60 ] considered the non-uniform current density distribution, 
which is affected by the distribution of water and reactant, by in- 
troducing an empirical parameter, B , into the calculation of ηcon :

Eq. (5) has been used extensively in aging analysis [ 72 , 73 ], because 
it provides a convenient and quantitative evaluation of Pt catalyst 
degradation. 

Polarization comparison and analysis are the most basic means 
of  evaluating  degradation.  Fuel  cell  aging  leads  to  performance 
degradation through variation in key parameters of the above for- 
mulas. For instance, membrane thinning or cracking increases hy- 
drogen permeation and electronic short-circuiting, and also affects 
ionic conductivity. Pt catalyst degradation decreases the ECSA. The 
impact of the cathode catalyst is the dominant factor [74] , because 
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode is much slower 
than the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) by at least six orders 
of magnitude [75] . Carbon corrosion decreases the electrochemical 
activity of the Pt catalyst. The carbon support forms the electronic 
conductive network of the CL, so its deterioration affects the ohmic 
resistance [76] . The state of the carbon and ionomer in the CL also 
impacts  the  mass  transfer,  represented  here  by  i 
L .  Based  on  the 
empirical changing rules of the parameters in the aging process, 
Jouin et al. [ 29 , 60 ] presented a performance model encompassing 
an entire lifetime, which is helpful in guiding lifetime evaluation. 
Nowadays, under the background of unsatisfactory durability, prog- 
nostics and health management of the fuel cell have become even 
more important. Model-based [ 77 , 78 ], data-driven [ 79 , 80 ], and hy- 
brid [ 76 , 81 ] methods have been reported in the literature for the 
robust prediction of remaining useful lifetime. 

3. Open-circuit/idling condition 

The  PEM  fuel  cell  system  runs  without  power  output  when 
idling. The fuel cell stack must power system parts with a small 
operating current density (e.g. 10 mA • cm −2 in Refs. [ 15 , 82 , 83 ] and 
8 mA • cm −2 in Ref. [41] ) to maintain its normal function. The cath- 
ode remains at high potential, which is close to the OCV. Moreover, 
the membrane tends to dehydrate due to low water production. 
The OCV condition is always used to simulate idling, because of 
its similar effect on durability [84] . Severe chemical degradation of 
the membrane accompanied by growth and migration of Pt parti- 
cles occurs in these circumstances. 

and temperature are all key factors to be controlled, as listed in 
Table  S1.  To  approximate  the  actual  situation  in  a  fuel  cell  bus, 
where the idling voltage is controlled lower, Pei et al. [15] used 10 
mA • cm −2 idling current density to ensure a voltage of ≤0.9 V. To 
investigate chemical degradation and membrane endurance under 
the open-circuit/idling condition, more stringent measures such as 
higher operating temperature and lower humidity may be added 
to  the AST  protocol. An  increase in back  pressure, which means 
higher partial pressure of the reactant, enhances gas permeation 
through the membrane and accelerates the chemical degradation. 
Ohma et al. [84] even supplied oxygen to the cathode for the same 
reason. 

3.1.2. Reversible degradation and recovery procedures 

In durability tests, we focus on irreversible degradation, which 
implies the unrecoverable aging and damage of the MEA materi- 
als.  In contrast,  reversible degradation corresponds to  temporary 
variations in the internal state, which can be recovered by appro- 
priate procedures. Speciﬁcally, reversible degradation is attributed 
primarily to mass transfer problems resulting from water accumu- 
lation  [85-88]  and  reversible  loss  of  the  ECSA  caused  by  oxida- 
tion and dissolution of the Pt catalyst [ 85 , 89-91 ]. Gas contamina- 
tion  (e.g.  CO)  also  causes  reversible  performance  decay,  but  this 
depends on gas quality and is avoidable. Reversible performance 
decay during durability testing must be eliminated, otherwise it al- 
ters the accuracy of the degradation assessment and leads to an in- 
correct estimate of aging. Kundu et al. [86] reported that reversible 
degradation is much greater than irreversible degradation in OCV 
durability testing. Their estimated irreversible decay rate of OCV 
was only 0.089 mV • h −1 , whereas the OCV decay rate during the 
ﬁrst 20 h, which represents reversible degradation to a great ex- 
tent, reached 5.8 mV • h −1 . Prasanna et al. [87] observed obviously 
reversible phenomena in a fuel cell operating at 600 mA • cm −2 , as 
did Jouin et al. [29] . Reversible performance decay was detected at 
constant operating current densities between 0 and 10 0 0 mA • cm −2 
[85] . The AST of open-circuit/idling is always static, so reversible 
decay occurs easily. Moreover, the high cathode potential during 
open-circuit/idling enhances the Pt dissolution and the formation 
of Pt oxides, which also explains the noticeable reversible degra- 
dation under this condition. Therefore, it is important to eliminate 
the impact of reversible degradation in ASTs at open-circuit/idling. 
Table  1  summarizes  recovery  procedures  reported  in  the  litera- 
ture. Generally, adjusting the operating conditions during the re- 
covery procedure is effective. For example, Kundu et al. [86] ob- 
served  recovery  by  adjusting  the  operating  temperature.  Halting 
the test for characterizations or for a rest period is also effective 
[29] .  Kundu  et  al.  [86]  and  Pei  et  al.  [15]  interrupted  durability 
testing at intervals to record polarization curves. Reversible decay 
was clearly identiﬁed by this procedure. Gazdzick et al. [85] sum- 
marized recovery strategies for different types of reversible degra- 
dation, including gas purging for water removal and lowering the 
potential for the reduction of Pt oxide. N 
2 purging in the cathode 
seems a feasible choice for both water removal and cathode po- 
tential reduction. In addition, Zhang et al. [88] and Zhang et al. 
[92] applied their custom-designed potential cycles (dynamic pro- 
cesses) as recovery procedures. Zhang et al. [88] also determined 
that the ECSA was restored to some degree during the recovery 
cycle,  whereas the variation tendency of the hydrogen crossover 
ﬂux  did  not  change.  These  results  indicate  a  deﬁnite  correlation 
between reversible degradation and the condition of the catalyst.

factors, especially the high cathode potential, will also accelerate 
the aging of the Pt catalyst signiﬁcantly. Franck et al. [93] investi- 
gated fuel cell aging at low current densities. They compared de- 
cay rates of the nominal voltage in durability tests at 20 and 120 
mA • cm −2 . The former was almost eight times the latter, thereby 
demonstrating the acceleration of aging under open-circuit/idling 
condition. Moreover, they determined that ﬂuorine loss and Pt mi- 
gration were more severe at 20 mA • cm −2  than at 120 mA • cm −2 . 
Han et al. [94] carried out ASTs at OCV with three types of mem- 
brane, Naﬁon NRE212, Naﬁon HP, and SPES50, and detected evi- 
dent increases in ohmic resistance and hydrogen crossover, as well 
as a decrease in the ECSA. Gaumont et al. [95] reported that high 
frequency resistance increased by nearly 70% within a 300 h OCV 
test. 

3.2.1. Chemical degradation of the membrane 

This  section  reviews  the  mechanism  of  chemical  degradation 
speciﬁcally  with  regard  to  the  generation  of  hydrogen  peroxide 
and the generation and attack of free radicals. Gas crossover is the 
root of the problem [ 86 , 94 , 96 ]. Reasons for acceleration of chemi- 
cal degradation under open-circuit/idling are also summarized.

3.2.1.1. Generation  of  hydrogen  peroxide  and  free  radicals.  Chemi- 
cal degradation of the PFSA membrane arises from the attack of 
free radicals, including the hydroxyl radical ( • OH), hydrogen radi- 
cal ( • H), the hydroperoxyl radical ( • OOH). The presence of hydrogen 
peroxide (H 
2 ) [ 82 , 97 ] and radicals [98-101] in the fuel cell has 
been conﬁrmed experimentally. Peron et al. [102] detected similar 
fragments in the product water in an in-situ OCV test to that in 
the ex-situ Fenton’s test. Hydrogen peroxide is generated in a PEM 
fuel cell by the two-electron ORR reaction: 
O 2 + 2H 

− → H 2 O 2 , E 0 = 0 . 695 V vs . SHE ( 75 
The cathode potential is relatively high in a PEM fuel cell and 
can reach 0.9 V under open-circuit/idling condition. This potential

inhibits H 
2 O 
2 in the fuel cell, because its potential is 
the major source of H 
lower  and  meets  the  conditions  of  H 
2  generation.  The  hydro- 
gen in the anode and crossover oxygen are the principal reactants 
[ 101 , 103-112 ]. Therefore, gas permeation is a key factor detrimen- 
tal to the chemical stability of the membrane. As proof, researchers 
[ 83 , 107 , 113 , 114 ]  have  investigated  the  effect  of  membrane  thick- 
ness, which is related to the gas permeation rate, on the aging pro- 
cess, and have detected a disproportionate decrease in the thick- 
ness  of  thinner  membranes  as  well  as  a  sharp  rise  in  hydrogen 
crossover.

Radical  generation  resembles  the  process  that  occurs  in  the 
2 /Fe 2 + ), where transition metal ions (repre- 
Fenton’s reagent (H 
sented by M 2 + , such as Fe 2 + ,Co 2 + , and Cu 2 + ) participate in a series 
of reactions. Metal ions may be introduced during manufacture of 
the MEA and stack, derived from components in the fuel cell sys- 
tem [ 115 , 116 ], or released from the metal bipolar plates once they 
are used [117-119] . Metal-ion release is a major reason why dura- 
bility of the metal plate stack is a more serious problem than it

Li  et  al.  [121]  conﬁrmed  the  effect  of  Fe 3 +  by  injecting  the 
Fe(ClO 
3  solution into the air supplied to the fuel cell. As proof 
of  accelerated  chemical  degradation  of  the  membrane,  pinholes 
formed more rapidly and led to ultimate failure of the fuel cell. Hy- 
droxyl radicals can also be generated at the catalyst surface by di- 
rect reaction of hydrogen and crossover oxygen in the anode [122- 
125] : 

H 2 + O 2 → 2 • OH. 

(13) 

Consequently, crossover oxygen and a lower potential make the 
anode a principal source of H 
2  and subsequent radicals. Addi- 
2 O 
tionally,  low  valence  metal  ions,  such  as  Fe 2 + ,  are  more  stable 
near the anode, which exposes the anode side of the membrane to 
a more corrosive environment. Fluorescence probe measurements 
[ 98 , 100 ] have demonstrated that the • OH concentration at the an- 
ode side is greater than that at the cathode side. 

3.2.1.2. Attack  of  free  radicals  on  the  membrane.  The  result  of 
free radical attack on PFSA membranes includes thinning, surface 
roughness, cracks, and pinholes. These morphological changes af- 
fect  proton  conductivity,  gas  crossover,  and  ultimate  membrane 
stability. The basic molecular structure of a PFSA membrane con- 
sists of a main chain and side chains. The main chain determines 
the  mechanical  properties,  and  the  side  chain  determines  pro- 
ton conductivity via a terminal sulfonic acid group [124] . The pri- 
mary unzipping mechanisms that occur during chemical degrada- 
tion  of  the  membrane  are  described  in  Fig.  3 .  Here,  the  widely 
used Naﬁon® structure with long side chains is taken as a typi- 
cal example, as Fig. 3 (a) shows. As a primary radical product, • OH 
plays a key role in this process. Gubler et al. [126] ranked the ox- 
idative damage potential of radicals as • OH > • H > • OOH. Both the 
main chain and side chains are attacked at weak points accompa- 
nied by ﬂuorine release. Fig. 3 (b) illustrates how the main chain 
is attacked at a terminal carboxyl group [ 104 , 123 , 127-131 ], lead- 
ing to continuous unzipping and shortening of the main chain. The 
terminal carboxyl group is introduced mainly in the manufactur- 
ing process [123] . Ghassemzadeh et al. [ 124 , 132 ] studied structural 
changes following • OH attack on a Naﬁon 211 membrane, which 
has negligible carboxyl content, by 19 F magic angle spinning nu- 
clear magnetic resonance. Their results revealed the main chain to 
be nearly intact. However, side chains were severely degraded at

inherently weak bonds, including α-OCF 
2 , and C-S bonds. 
These bonds make key contributions to membrane functionality in 
terms of proton conductivity. As Fig. 3 (c) shows, • OH can attack 
a  C-S  bond  directly  [ 104 , 123 , 133 ],  resulting  in  decomposition  of 
the terminal sulfonic acid group. The C-O bond, which is present 
in the α-OCF 
2  bonds in the long side chain, is also 
vulnerable, although differences in susceptibility exist between α- 
2 . Fig. 3 (d) shows that α-OCF 
OCF 
2  is attacked prior 
to β-OCF 
2 ,  leading  to  cleavage  of  the  main  chain  at  the  branch 
point. The sequence of reactions has been incorporated in models 
of  membrane  chemical  degradation  in  Refs.  [ 108 , 120 , 134 ].  Ghas- 
semzadeh et al. [ 124 , 132 ] conﬁrmed the reaction sequence exper- 
imentally. They found that β-OCF 
2 damage lags behind that of α- 
2 groups changes less. The • H radical attacks 
OCF 
mainly at the tertiary carbon branch point (see Fig. 3 (e)), as re- 
ported in Ref. [132] . The tertiary carbon on the side chain is also 
easily attacked by • H [ 104 , 132 ]. All described corrosion reactions 
produce hydroﬂuoric acid (HF), which makes the ﬂuorine emission 
rate (FER) a reliable indicator of membrane stability. This parame- 
ter has been widely used in investigations [ 105 , 106 , 114 , 135-139 ].

3.2.1.3. Primary  aging  factors  during  open-circuit/idling.  Open- 
circuit/idling  is  recognized  as  the  most  serious  condition  for 
chemical degradation of the membrane for two primary reasons: 
strong  gas  permeation  and  high  cathode  potential.  Here,  the 
so-called  gas  permeation  mainly  corresponds  to  that  of  oxygen. 
Greater  ﬂuorine  emission  [93]  and  higher  average  • OH  den- 
sity  [100]  at  low  load  current  conﬁrm  the  damaging  effect  of 
open-circuit/idling condition. The details are discussed as follows: 

(a) Stronger oxygen permeation 
Gas  permeation  reaches  a  maximum  under  OCV  condition 
[ 86 , 128 , 134 , 140 , 141 ].  Firstly,  the  absence  of  gas  consumption  at 
OCV elevates the partial pressure of the reactant in the electrode 
[ 100 , 101 , 107 , 142 , 143 ]. Thus, the residual oxygen concentration in- 
creases as the load current decreases, and oxygen permeation in- 
creases  in  accordance  with  Fick’s  law.  Secondly,  the  absence  of 
water production at OCV reduces the water content of the mem- 
brane and the partial pressure of water in the cathode. Inadequate 

swelling of the membrane increases membrane porosity, and the 
low partial pressure of water creates space for oxygen in the cath- 
ode [135] . Gummalla et al. [135] and Kundu et al. [144] studied 
the effect of the relative humidity (RH) of the supplied gas on the 
chemical degradation of the membrane. Their results show that a 
lower  RH  results  in  greater  ﬂuorine  release.  Finally,  because  the 
electro-osmotic water drag can help hydrogen crossover [123] , it 
can also impede the transportation of dissolved oxygen to the an- 
ode. Therefore, under OCV condition, the oxygen permeates to the 
anode without the hindrance from electro-osmotic drag. Note that 
the idling condition is very similar to the OCV condition. 

(b) Higher cathode potential 
An  elevated  cathode  potential  is  recognized  as  an  important 
factor in the accelerated chemical degradation of the membrane, 
although the mechanism is far from clear and has been rarely in- 
vestigated. To reveal the mechanism, Wong et al. [120] described 
an iron ion redox cycle and applied it for one-dimensional model- 
ing of chemical degradation. In detail, the redox reaction between 
ferrous and the ferric ions is considered in the fuel cell: 
Fe 3+ + e 

− → Fe 2+ ,

the cathode potential is actually associated with the oxygen con- 
centration in the cathode. However, cathode gas recirculation still 
requires conﬁrmation by durability tests. Moreover, other effective 
ways to reduce or eliminate these problems are required.

ber, and (cid:10) is the ionomer potential. Eq. (16) considers both dif- 
fusion  induced  by  the  concentration  gradient  and  migration  in- 
duced  by  the  potential  gradient  in  the  ionomer,  but  convective 
mass transport is neglected. The potential gradient in the ionomer 
is directly related to the cell voltage, together with the operating 
current density. Wong et al. [120] revealed that the Fe 2 + concen- 
tration in the membrane decreased by 93% and that the degrada- 
tion rate dropped sharply as the cell voltage decreased from the 
OCV to 0.7 V. Futter  et al.  [116] added the iron ion redox  cycle 
to  a  two-dimensional  degradation  model  that  was  coupled  with 
a PEM fuel cell model to reveal the dependence on the cell volt- 
age. At high cathode potential, Fe 3 + can be driven to reach the an- 
ode where Fe 2 + is produced, thus continuously supplying Fe 2 + for 
the Fenton reaction. As shown in Fig. 4 , a decrease in cell volt- 
age suppresses the migration of Fe 3 + in the ionomer, which shifts 
the primary location of Fe 2 + and membrane degradation from the 
anode side to the cathode side, accompanied by a signiﬁcant mit- 
igation of chemical degradation. Quantitatively, as the cell voltage 
decreases from 0.95 to 0.75 V, the maximum c 
F e 2+  decreases by 
91.3%, and the maximum FER decreases by 92.5%, which demon- 
strates the pronounced effect of the cell voltage. However, these 
modeling studies still need further experimental validation. 

Mitigation of component degradation under open-circuit/idling 
condition requires a solution to the problems of excessive oxygen 
permeation and high cathode potential. Cathode exhaust gas recir- 
culation [146-150] is a possible remedy, although it has been pro- 
posed mainly for the self-humidiﬁcation of the cathode gas. Recir- 
culation can dilute the cathode gas to a lower oxygen concentra- 
tion and reduce the cathode potential particularly at lower loads 
[147-150] . Thus, two diﬃcult problems encountered under open- 
circuit/idling condition can be resolved to some extent. Note that 

In  addition  to  the  membrane,  the  CL  decays  signiﬁcantly 
[ 82 , 86 , 88 , 114 , 151 , 152 ].  The  degradation  is  primarily  attributed  to 
the high cell voltage under open-circuit/idling condition. Here, we 
focus on the Pt catalyst in the cathode, which experiences the most 
serious problems. The pronounced growth of Pt particles greatly 
decreases the ECSA. Ferreira et al. [153] compared the inﬂuence of 
operating at OCV and 200 mA • cm −2 on the decline in ECSA. They 
found the former condition to exert a much more pronounced im- 
pact. Akita et al. [154] reported the same result when comparing 
the decline in ECSA at 1.0 and 0.8 V. Zhang et al. [88] reported a 
51.9% decay in ECSA after a 256 h OCV test with reversible degra- 
dation recovered. Fig. 5 (a) and Fig. 5 (b) show electrochemical Ost- 
wald  ripening  and  coalescence,  which  are  principal  mechanisms 
leading to the growth of Pt particles. Ostwald ripening is driven by 
a reduction of the interface energy of Pt particles, in which Pt cata- 
lyst dissolves from smaller particles and redeposits on larger parti- 
cles, for a more stable state [ 54 , 55 , 114 , 151 , 155 , 156 ]. Note that Ost- 
wald ripening is treated in greater detail in section 4.2.3.2 . Signiﬁ- 
cant dissolution of the Pt catalyst occurs at high cathode potential 
under open-circuit/idling condition [ 106 , 107 , 143 , 151 , 155 , 157 ]. The 
Pt  dissolution  process  can  be  described  as  follows  [ 106 , 114 , 158- 
160 ]:

It is worth noting that, for Pt nanoparticles in a fuel cell, sur- 
face tension lowers the equilibrium potentials in Eqs. (17) and ( 18 ). 
The  pathway  represented  by  Eqs.  (18)  and  ( 19 )  is  the  principal 
means of Pt dissolution based on an analysis of equilibrium po- 
tentials [143] . Pt oxide is ﬁrst generated at the surface of Pt par- 
ticles, followed by chemical dissolution of the oxide. The product

of Pt oxidation may not always be PtO, as PtO 
2 [160] and Pt(OH) 
2 
[158] have also been reported. Guilminot et al. [161] reported the 
accelerated  dissolution  of  Pt  at  potentials  above  0.8  V  and  em- 
phasized the important role of chemical dissolution of PtO via Eq. 
(19). Wang et al. [162] studied the effect of potential on the dis- 
solution of Pt using a polycrystalline Pt wire. They found that the 
concentration of dissolved Pt increases apparently with increasing 
potential at values below 1.1 V. Thereafter, Pt particles supported 
on carbon [163] are reported to suffer an increase in dissolution 
with increasing potentials between 0.65 and 1.0 V in potentiostatic 
tests. Thus, Ostwald ripening intensiﬁes due to elevated concentra- 
tions  of  dissolved  Pt  under  open-circuit/idling condition.  Greater 
hydrogen permeation under open-circuit/idling condition may also 
increase the agglomeration of Pt particles due to hot spots in the 
cathode, which originate from the direct reaction of oxygen with 
crossover hydrogen. A thermal load can accelerate the agglomer- 
ation  and  sintering  of  Pt  particles.  Zhao  et  al.  [114]  studied  the 
effect  of  membrane  thickness  on  catalyst  agglomeration  at  OCV. 
The results are shown in Fig. 6 . The ECSA of the fuel cell with a 
thinner membrane, which corresponds to higher hydrogen perme- 
ation, decays faster in the OCV test ( Fig. 6 (a)), as conﬁrmed by the 
more rapid agglomeration of Pt particles (see Fig. 6 (b)). Finally, the 
transfer of Pt 2 + and subsequent Pt catalyst decay intensify due to 
the high concentration of dissolved Pt 2 +  in the cathode. Fig. 5 (c)

shows that Pt 2 + can diffuse in the fuel cell and precipitate in the 
ionomer or membrane. This process will be covered in detail in 
section 3.2.3 . 

3.2.3. Pt migration and precipitation 

A  high  concentration  of  dissolved  Pt 2 +  in  the  cathode  and 
a  low  concentration  in  the  anode  will  drive  mass  transport  by 
the diffusion. Under open-circuit/idling condition, this concentra- 
tion  gradient  dominates  the  movement  of  Pt 2 +  from  the  cath- 
ode to the anode due to the negligible potential gradient in the 
ionomer  [164] .  In  the  process,  Pt 2 +  is  reduced  to  a  microcrys- 
talline form depositing in the ionomer or the membrane, which 
reduces the Pt content of the electrode. This phenomenon is the 
so-called Pt migration. When separated from the carbon support, 
the  Pt  deposits  cannot  catalyze  the  desired  reaction  due  to  the 
absence of electrons. Although Pt migration is not a unique phe- 
nomenon under open-circuit/idling condition, it is the most pro- 
nounced under this condition due to extensive Pt dissolution. Po- 
tential cycling also enhances Pt dissolution and promotes Pt mi- 
gration [ 128 , 155 , 165-167 ]. Guilminot et al. [168] reported notice- 
able Pt precipitation in the membrane at a current density of 180 
mA • cm −2 . Franck et al. [93] published transmission electron mi- 
croscope (TEM) views of Pt precipitation produced at 120 and 20 
mA • cm −2 ( Fig. 7 ). Obviously, lower current density leads to more 
severe  Pt  migration,  which  further  conﬁrms  the  effect  of  open- 
circuit/idling. Zhang et al. [169] even estimated that 55% of the Pt 
in the cathode migrated into the membrane after a 20 0 0 h OCV 
test. A typical result of Pt migration is the formation of a Pt band

in the membrane [ 102 , 170 ], which indicates that deposition occurs 
mainly in a certain location of the membrane. Band formation cor- 
responds to loss of Pt content in the electrode and affects mem- 
brane degradation. Pt band formation, therefore, is an important 
issue  in  fuel  cell  durability,  especially  under  open-circuit/idling 
condition. 

3.2.3.1. Pt band formation in the membrane.  Pt 2 +  dissolves at the 
cathode and diffuses into the membrane under the inﬂuence of a 
concentration gradient. Once the Pt 2 + meets the crossover hydro- 
gen, it can be reduced to atomic Pt, as shown in Fig. 8 (a). Crys- 
tal nuclei ﬁrst form in the membrane [ 155 , 167 ], and subsequently, 
Pt 2 + continues to precipitate onto the crystallite surface, leading to 
crystallite growth. The precipitated Pt crystals, especially the larger 
precipitates, form the so-called Pt band. A correlation between the 
location  of  the  Pt  band  and  the  equilibrium  partial  pressures  of 
oxygen in the cathode and hydrogen in the anode has been iden- 
tiﬁed [ 102 , 169 , 171-173 ]. Zhang et al. [169] , Yoon et al. [174] , and 
Cheng et al. [175] all observed the movement of the Pt band to- 
wards the anode with a decrease in hydrogen partial pressure de- 
creasing or an increase in oxygen partial pressure. 

The partial pressures and diffusion coeﬃcients of oxygen and 
hydrogen determine the mixed potential in the membrane, which 
involves the ORR and the HOR. Researchers [ 111 , 176-178 ] have in- 
serted Pt microprobes to determine the spatial distribution of the 
mixed  potential  in  the  membrane  and  have  noticed  an  abrupt 

change (potential step) at a certain location between the cathode 
and the anode. The potential proﬁle can be explained and validated 
with a one-dimensional model [ 172 , 179 ]. As shown in Fig. 8 , sepa- 
rated by the potential step, the diffusion limitation of HOR (repre- 
sented by i d 
HOR ) limits the surface reaction of the Pt microprobes or 
particles on the cathode side ( Fig. 8 (b)), thus the mixed potential is 
close to the equilibrium potential of the ORR. On the anode side, it 
is limited by the diffusion limitation of ORR (represented by i d 
ORR ), 
as shown in Fig. 8 (d). It should be noted that the above analysis is 
based on the hypothesis that the surface reactions of the Pt micro- 
probes or particles is diffusion controlled. Assuming spherical Pt 
particles, the diffusion limited current density can be expressed as

Pt  is  the  ra-

Pt is suﬃciently small, the diffusion limitation, represented 
when r 
by i d 
ORR , may be too high to be reached. The surface re- 
action  is  then  under  kinetic  control,  and  the  mixed  potential  in 
the membrane (~0.45 V) changes slowly with location. Atrazhev et 
al. [179] and Eslamibidgoli et al. [172] studied the effect of par- 
ticle size on the potential proﬁle in the membrane by modeling. 
They  found  that  the  step-like  feature  becomes  more  clearly  de- 
ﬁned with increasing particle size and the reaction shifts from ki- 
netically  control  to  diffusion  controlled,  as  shown  in  Fig.  9 .  The 
location of the potential step is independent of particle size. Ex- 
periments [177] and simulations [ 172 , 179 ] conﬁrmed that the po- 
2  or de- 
tential step moves towards the anode with increasing P O 
creasing  P H 
2 ,  as  does  the  Pt  band.  Actually,  the  Pt  band  is  lo- 
cated  at  the  point  where  the  mixed  potential  changes  abruptly 
[ 176-178 , 181-183 ], which is also where i d 
ORR  ( Fig. 
8 ). Although particle growth in the Pt band renders it visible, a 
more extensive distribution of small Pt particles exists outside the 
Pt band, as shown in Fig. 10 . Burlatsky et al. [ 166 , 183 ] reported 
a uniform distribution of small particles (5-10 nm) in the mem- 
brane, whereas large particles (20-100 nm) mainly gather in the 
Pt band. A particle size of 10 nm has been reported as a thresh- 
old value in Ref. [179] , above which the potential step is remark- 
able. We conclude that the distribution of small particles derives 
from the kinetically controlled surface reaction, which leads to a 
gentle change in the mixed potential at around 0.45 V. There is 
no potential step at the early stages of Pt nucleation and growth. 
Thus, the distribution of small particles is independent of the po- 
tential  step,  but  depends  on  the  distribution  of  Pt 2 +  and  H 
2  in 
the membrane. Brieﬂy, nucleation and early growth are governed 
by  the  kinetically  controlled  reaction,  whereas  crystallite  growth 
in  the  Pt  band  is  governed  by  the  diffusion-controlled  reaction 
and subsequently the potential distribution. The large Pt precipi- 
tates closer to the cathode can further dissolve and move to the 
Pt band because of the high mixed potential, which is as high as 
the cathode potential. Thus, a stable Pt band is always located in 
the region with a low mixed potential, i.e. the hydrogen-rich re- 
gion. The location of the potential step and the Pt band is given by

3.2.3.2. Debate  and  resolution  concerning  the  Pt  band.  The  de- 
posited Pt band in the membrane cannot catalyze the desired ORR 
in the cathode because of the electronic disconnection, so this rep- 
resents a loss of Pt load in the cathode and consequently reduces 
the ECSA. In addition, because Pt 2 + is transported through mem- 
brane ion channels and the Pt crystallites precipitate and grow in 
these channels, Pt deposition in the membrane can hinder proton 
transport and decrease the proton conductivity of the membrane 
[185] . It is also possible for the deposited Pt to result in an internal 
electronic short circuit of the membrane [ 159 , 185 ]. Meanwhile, the 
Pt band serves as a catalytic center in the membrane, and products 
of the catalytic reaction can affect the chemical degradation of the

membrane. Currently, the impact of the Pt band on the durabil- 
ity of the PFSA membrane and the mechanism remain under de- 
bate [ 98 , 138 , 139 , 141 , 172 ]. The controversy focuses on whether the 
Pt band accelerates or suppresses the production of H 
2 and free 
radicals, as provided in Table S2. On the one hand, the Pt band may 
catalyze the formation of H 
2 or free radicals by the reaction of 
crossover oxygen from the cathode and crossover hydrogen from 
the anode, which will accelerate decomposition of the membrane. 
Researchers [ 159 , 174 , 181 , 186 ] have revealed the negative effect of 
the Pt band on membrane durability indirectly by measurement of 
the FER and membrane thickness. Furthermore, an area suffering 
accelerated aging in the thickness direction of the membrane has 
been observed close to the Pt band [ 84 , 173 , 187 ], as shown in Fig. 
11 . Kim et al. [137] even found the enhanced formation of aggres- 
sive radicals in an electrode sandwiched between membranes by 
means of electron spin resonance (ESR). On the other hand, de- 
posited  Pt  particles  can  also  scavenge  H 
2  and  free  radicals  in 
the membrane and directly catalyze the crossover oxygen and hy- 
drogen to produce water, as reported in Refs. [ 188 , 189 ]. There is 
also controversy between researchers investigating the degradation 
of Pt-impregnated and Pt-dispersed membranes [ 136 , 138 , 190 ], al- 
though the distribution of deposited Pt is quite different from that 
in the Pt band. 

2 O 

The impact of Pt deposition is never absolute, and many factors 
may be involved in the controversy. Pt deposition in the membrane 
can simultaneously catalyze the formation and quenching of H 
2 O 
2 
and radicals, whereby the physical and chemical conditions of the 
Pt band determine which is facilitated and which is suppressed. 
In other words, there is a competition between the formation and 
quenching reactions. The key factors are summarized below. 

2 O 

(a) Potential of the Pt band 
The Pt band is located at the potential step in the membrane 
[ 134 , 155 , 176 , 178 , 181 ], as discussed in section 3.2.3.1 . The potential 
of the in-situ formed Pt band is always as low as that of the anode, 
which is approximately zero. This inherently low potential acceler- 
ates the formation of H 
2 and radicals and the chemical degrada- 
tion of the membrane particularly in the area around the Pt band, 
which explains why a negative effect of the Pt band is easily found. 
Moreover, the effect of the potential was observed by Helmly et 
al. [186] , who adjusted P 
H2  to change the potential of the Pt 
band. A higher potential was found to relieve chemical degrada- 
tion of the membrane, although membrane aging was still accel- 
erated. In addition, we surmise that the positive effect reported in 
Ref. [188] is related to the high potential of the Pt band because

perimental MEA discussed in this work was removed from transit 
buses, supplied with air having an oxygen concentration of about 
21% in the Pt deposition process. 

2 O 

(b) Structure and shape of Pt crystals in the Pt band 
The deposited Pt particles that nucleate and grow in the mem- 
brane take on different structures and shapes due to differences 
in the concentrations of Pt 2 +  and H 
2  supplied to the crystal sur- 
face, as well as the crystal surface energy [ 154 , 171 ]. Crystal mor- 
phology  affects  catalytic  properties.  Lee  et  al.  [191]  and  Kim  et 
al. [192] have reported that synthesized dendritic Pt crystals show 
higher  catalytic  activity.  In  particular,  Kim  et  al.  [192]  revealed 
the suppression of H 
2 production when Pt dendrites were used, 
which is similar to the situation observed for Pt deposits in the 
membrane. Macauley et al. [171] observed several different Pt par- 
ticle shapes in the in-situ experiments, as shown in Fig. 12 . Differ- 
ent Pt deposition processes, designated here as PITM-01, PITM-02, 
and PITM-03, result in different shapes and structures of Pt parti- 
cles and consequently, different lif etimes, represented by the stack 
leak  rate.  Star-shaped  and  curly  dendritic  Pt  crystals  with  large 
sizes tend to scavenge H 
2  and crossover gases, whereas small 
cubic particles may have a negative effect. Macauley et al. [171] at- 
tributed these differences to the Pt crystal facets. The beneﬁcial in- 
ﬂuence of the star-shaped and curly dendritic Pt crystals is thought 
to derive from a signiﬁcant amount of the Pt(111) facet. Indeed, the 
catalytic selectivity of different crystal facets affects the reaction 
product [ 74 , 106 ], where H 
2 O is formed via the 4-electron ORR and 
H 

2 is formed by the 2-electron ORR.

The  generation  and  quenching  of  H 

2  and  radicals  compete 
with one other on the catalyst surface, so a precondition of radical- 
induced chemical degradation is their ability to escape being scav- 
enged and attack the membrane. The concentration and distribu- 
tion of Pt particles have a key impact on this process. Rodgers et 
al. [139] and Helmly et al. [157] studied membranes with different 
concentrations of dispersed Pt and found that a higher concentra- 
tion leads to a lower FER, which is indicative of decelerated mem- 
2  release on the Pt particles with 
brane aging. A decrease in H

increasing catalyst concentration was reported by Bonakdarpour et 
al. [193] and Inaba et al. [194] , who investigated the ORR on Pt 
or Pt/C catalysts on rotating ring-disk electrodes (RRDEs). Indeed, a 
higher concentration and a denser distribution reduce the possibil- 
ity of escape of H 
2 and radicals are 
2 and radicals. In detail, H 
easily caught and quenched by neighboring particles if they escape 
from a particle surface, due to the small spacing between particles. 
Besides the above factors, the amount and size of Pt particles 
may  also  have  an  effect,  whereas  they  are  coupled  with  struc- 
ture,  shape,  concentration,  and  distribution  density  to  some  de- 
gree.  Awareness  of  the  controlling  factors  expands  the  prospect 
of enhancing the durability of the PFSA membrane. For example, 
it may be possible to promote membrane stability and durability 
with an artiﬁcially induced Pt band.

4. Dynamic load 

PEM fuel cell systems must frequently shift their output power 
to meet the power demand of vehicle driving and energy manage- 
ment. Importantly, load changing is the harshest condition for the 
durability of PEM fuel cells. In the transient process, the electrode 
potential,  the  stoichiometric  ratio  of  supplied  gases,  the  internal 
temperature, the internal pressure, and the water state experience 
rapid ﬂuctuations, thereby accelerating fuel cell aging. 

4.1. AST of dynamic load 

A dynamic load accelerates fuel cell aging for multi-aspect rea- 
sons. First, water production and thermal output vary with changes 
in load, which consequently creates thermal/humidity cycling. Sec- 
ond,  dynamic  demand  on  the  gas  supply  may  cause  gas  starva- 
tion during load-up. Third, the potential cycling that accompanies 
the dynamic load degrades the catalyst. Table S3 lists typical AST 
methods of the dynamic load in the literature. In-situ current (or 
current density) cycling best approximates the actual situation of 
dynamic load. In practice, the most tough condition for a fuel cell 
is  to  change  load  immediately  between  the  idling  (or  OCV)  and 
the rated condition (or even overload). As given in Table S3, Lai et 
al. [195] , Weng et al. [196] , and Wang et al. [197] have done so 
by applying a rectangular wave. Wu et al. [198] even used this AST 
2 . Load changing proﬁles with peak shaped 
method with supplied O 
[199] and trapezoidal shape [200] have also been reported in the 
literature. Further, in order to simulate the real application envi- 
ronment of PEM fuel cells as an automotive power source, driving 
cycles are introduced to asses durability, as reviewed in Ref. [19] . 
However, driving cycles and related test protocols are mainly used 
to evaluate fuel cell durability and projected lifetime in a particular 
application environment, in most of which effects of other condi- 
tions, such as startup-shutdown, idling, and overload, are not iso- 
lated. In other words, dynamic load is not the only focus in driving 
cycle tests. 

2  and H 

In order to explore the degradation accelerated by different fac- 
tors under dynamic load condition, potential cycling and humid- 
ity cycling are applied to investigate catalyst aging and mechan- 
ical degradation, respectively. In potential cycling, N 
2  are 
supplied to the cathode and anode, respectively. The anode serves 
as a reference electrode and a potentiostat is used to control the 
cathode potential. With the cathode potential range in a working 
fuel cell considered, the applied potential is always cycled from 0.6 
to  0.9-1.0  V  [201-206] ,  which  matches  the  test  protocols  of  the 
DOE [8] and the fuel cell commercialization conference of Japan 
(FCCJ)  [ 202 , 207 ].  Here,  the  0.6  and  0.9-1.0  V  values  are  corre- 
sponding to the cell voltage under rated and OCV/idling conditions, 
respectively. Triangular [ 204 , 205 ], rectangular [ 8 , 201 , 202 , 204 , 207 ], 
and  trapezoidal  [202-204]  waves  are  extensively  used  as  poten-

4.2. Degradation mechanisms under dynamic load condition 

Under the condition of dynamic load, thermal/humidity cycling, 
gas starvation, and potential cycling create the most adverse work- 
ing  environment  for  the  MEA,  as  described  in  section  4.1 .  Con- 
sequently,  mechanical  degradation  of  components,  carbon  corro- 
sion, and catalyst aging are radically accelerated. Fault conditions, 
including  water  ﬂooding  and  membrane  dehydration,  may  occur 
during a load changing process [ 16 , 34 ], and cause a rapid decay 
in performance. These performance decays can be recovered with 
proper management, so they are reversible and avoidable. It must 
be noted that this section focuses on the irreversible degradation. 

4.2.1. Multi-aspects of mechanical degradation 

Mechanical  degradation  of  components  results  from  ﬂuctua- 
tions  in  water  state  under  the  condition  of  dynamic  load.  The 
electrode reaction and electro-osmotic drag are both enhanced at 
greater loads, which leads to water absorption and elevated water 
content in the membrane and ionomer. Conversely, the membrane 
and ionomer will dehydrate, and the water content decreases. The 
proton conductivity of the membrane is closely related to its water 
content [210] , as shown in the formula [ 211 , 212 ]:

where κ
ion is the proton conductivity, λ is the water content, and T 
is the temperature. Yan et al. [213] and Lai et al. [195] studied vari- 
ations in the ohmic resistance upon a change in load. As shown in 
Fig. 13 , the ohmic resistance decreases with an increase in load, 
which is indicative of a higher water content and consistent with 
the above analysis. Weng et al. [196] noticed a similar phenomenon 
in almost every segment of their segmented fuel cell, whereas dif- 
ferences  existed  between  segments  due  to  heterogeneous  water 
distribution. As a result of humidity cycling, the membrane falls 
into a shrinking-swelling cycle [214-221] . That is, it dehydrates and 
shrinks during drying, and absorbs water and swells during wet- 
ting.  The  generated  cyclic  stresses  may  result  in  mechanical  fa-

tigue  and  failure  characterized  by  membrane  thinning,  pinholes, 
and  cracks.  Liu  et  al.  [222]  observed  a  rapid  increase  in  hydro- 
gen crossover current density from 2 to 17 mA • cm −2  after a 600 
h load cycling test, indicating rapid failure of the membrane. Weng 
et al. [196] observed a distinct increase in the hydrogen crossover 
current density of the downstream segment. The downstream area 
of the fuel cell is exactly where humidity cycling is more violent. 
Lai et al. [195] compared the current density distribution and lo- 
cal membrane degradation in counter-ﬂow and co-ﬂow patterns, 
as shown in Fig. 14 . The average current density cycles in the form 
of a square wave between 80 and 800 mA • cm −2 . The seriously de- 
graded region, as indicated by the local leak rate and local mem- 
brane thinning, is just corresponding to segments with larger ﬂuc- 
tuations  of  local  current  density  no  matter  in  counter-ﬂow  test 
or in co-ﬂow test. Larger local current density ﬂuctuations signify 
greater variation in the local water state, consistent with the effect 
of humidity cycling on membrane durability. Visually, Aindow et 
al. [223] , Mukundan et al. [208] and Alavijeh et al. [209] observed 
apparent cracks in the membrane after humidity cycling. 

Under  the  condition  of  dynamic  load,  mechanical  factors  af- 
fect  the  CL  in  addition  to  the  membrane.  Fig.  15  (a)-(e)  show 
comprehensive diagrams of mechanical aging, with multi-aspects 
included.  Fig.  15 (f)  illustrates  a  typical  case.  Therein,  Fig.  15 (e) 
depicts  the  formation  of  pinholes  and  cracks  in  the  membrane 
induced  by  fatigue  stress.  Due  to  the  differences  in  the  strain 
and deformation of the membrane and the CL during a swelling- 
shrinking process, residual stresses and strains lead to formation 
and extension of delamination of the two layers [ 51 , 197 , 209 , 224 ], 
as shown in Fig. 15 (d). Delamination of the CL and the GDL has 
also been reported [197] for the same reason. Delamination of the 
layers hinders the transport of electrons (between the CL and the 
GDL) or protons (between the CL and the membrane), and results 
in higher contact resistance and diminished output performance. 
Meanwhile, the current density in adjacent areas is forced to in- 

crease [51] , leading to higher water and heat production and ex- 
posing these adjacent areas to degradation. The CL contains multi- 
phase  components,  among  which  the  internal  ionomer  will  un- 
dergo  cyclic  swelling-shrinking  during  humidity  cycling,  in  con- 
trast  to  the  behavior  of  the  Pt/C.  Residual  stresses  and  strains 
will  cause  microstructural  changes  in  the  CL,  as  shown  in  Fig. 
15 (b)  and  (c).  Cracks  in  the  CL  have  been  extensively  observed 
[ 197 , 199 , 208 , 209 , 223 , 225-228 ].  Chang  et  al.  [228]  even  observed 
the growth of cracks in the CL by means of SEM after humidity 
cycling. Aindow et al. [223] concluded that membrane cracks orig- 
inate  from  the  CL  cracks  based  on  their  SEM  image.  Alavijeh  et 
al. [209] also found a close correlation between cracks in the CL 
and the membrane, as Fig. 15 (f) shows. It seems easy to under- 
stand the interplay between the membrane and the CL, because 
they are tightly attached to each other in the absence of delamina- 
tion. Whereas, we think that there is no absolute crack origin, and 
the problem is which layer is weaker. Turn back to microstructural 
changes in the CL and discuss on a smaller scale. First, deformation 
of the distributed ionomer may detach the covered or connected 
Pt particles from the carbon support [227] , thereby affecting the 
ECSA. Second, the highly dispersed ionomer tends to cluster dur- 
ing humidity cycling, leaving some Pt particles uncovered or over- 
covered, as shown in Fig. 15 (b). Zhao et al. [227] even observed 
ionomer agglomeration after cyclic water intrusion and evapora- 
tion of the CL, which simulate humidity cycling. As for the effect, 
uncovered surfaces of Pt particles are inaccessible to protons due 
to lack of contact with the ionomer, which is equivalent to a de- 
crease in ECSA. Conversely, agglomerated ionomer hinders the re- 
actant from reaching the over-covered Pt surface and impedes wa- 
ter transport [229] , resulting in a higher mass transfer resistance. 
Here, it should be noted that agglomeration and redistribution of 
the  ionomer  are  of  common  occurrence,  because  a  uniform  and 
highly dispersed distribution is inherently unstable. Venkatesan et 
al.  [229]  likewise reported a  highly  non-uniform ionomer  distri-

bution after square-wave potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.3 V. 
That is, conditions which cause changes in the Pt/C and CL struc- 
ture can all accelerate redistribution of the ionomer. 

4.2.2. Local and overall gas starvation 

Fuel and oxidant must be adequately supplied to ensure normal 
electrochemical operation of the PEM fuel cell, or abnormal reac- 
tion will happen to degrade the components. In the load-up pro- 
cess, the reactant supply lags behind the current increase [ 34 , 230- 
234 ].  Thus,  faster  load-up  results  in  more  severe  gas  starvation. 
Moreover,  the  distribution  and  supply  of  reactants  in  a  fuel  cell 
are inherently uneven, especially in fuel cells with a large active 
area. For example, there are inherent differences between different 

locations in a fuel cell stack [ 35 , 235 ], between the gas inlet and 
the outlet of a fuel cell [ 231 , 236-238 ], and even between the rib 
region and the channel region [34] . Differences may be magniﬁed 
in the load-up process, thus causing various degrees of gas starva- 
tion. The air starvation and the fuel starvation accelerate fuel cell 
aging in disparate ways. 

4.2.2.1. Air  starvation.  Inherent  diﬃculties  in  oxygen  transfer 
[239] and the non-uniformity of oxygen distribution [ 39 , 237 ] in- 
crease the risk of air starvation in a fuel cell. Improper design of 
the cathodic ﬂow ﬁeld may further aggravate the problem [238] . 
Local and overall air starvation induce the similar abnormal pro- 
cess, speciﬁcally hydrogen pumping. As shown in Fig. 16 (a), the air

starvation  occurs  when  a  forced  current  is  drawn  from  the  fuel 
cell,  but  air  is  in  short  supply.  Some  of  the  protons,  which  mi- 
grate from the anode to the cathode, cannot participate in the ORR 
due to the shortage of oxygen. Thus, the hydrogen evolution reac- 
tion (HER) occurs in the air starvation area. As evidence, under the 
condition of air starvation, hydrogen emission in the cathode ex- 
haust gas has been reported in the literature [240-243] . Narimani 
et al. [240] revealed an increase in the hydrogen emission rate with 
forced current. The air starvation lowers the output voltage of the 
fuel cell primarily through an abrupt decrease in the cathode po- 
tential. Overall air starvation can lead to slight cell reversal. As re- 
ported in Ref. [243] , at a current density of 600 mA • cm −2 , the cell 
voltage reached -0.08 V with an air stoichiometric ratio of 0.9, but 
remained higher than -0.2 V even with the an stoichiometric ratio 
of 0.2. Of course, the degree of cell reversal is consistent with the 
hydrogen pumping process. Furthermore, hydrogen pumped to the 
cathode can react with oxygen directly in the adjacent region, thus 
releasing a signiﬁcant quantity of heat and causing hot spots. By 

implanting thermocouples into a fuel cell, Dou et al. [243] detected 
a rapid local temperature rise almost concurrently with cell rever- 
sal. Note that, they attributed it partly to the non-uniform current 
density distribution. Gerard et al. [244] inferred the existence of 
hot spots from imprints of the seals on the bipolar plate. Hot spots 
can accelerate thermal aging of the membrane and catalyst sinter- 
ing in the cathode. Taniguchi et al. [232] investigated aging of the 
cathode catalyst under air starvation, and detected a 46% decay in 
ECSA and an obvious growth of catalyst particles after 120 min. In 
comparison, catalyst aging is much slighter under normal condi- 
tion. 

4.2.2.2. Fuel starvation.  The high incidence of fuel starvation partly 
originates  from  the  low  stoichiometric  ratio  of  hydrogen,  partic- 
ularly  in  anodic  dead-end  mode.  Of  course,  anode  recirculation 
can mitigate the problem to some degree [245-247] . A slight re- 
actant  shortage  in  the  load-up  process  may  magnify  the  non- 
uniformity of hydrogen distribution and result in local fuel star-

17 

ing on the degree of fuel starvation, local and overall starvation 
affect durability in totally different ways. Here, it is worth noting 
that they can be mitigated or even eliminated by optimizing the 
control of the gas supply [ 230 , 255 ], the reactant amount [255] , the 
gas ﬂow ﬁeld [256] , and the loading speed in the load-up process. 
In addition, adding a hydrogen reservoir at the hydrogen outlet of 
the stack [ 257 , 258 ] has also been reported to be effective. 

4.2.3. Dissolution and growth of Pt particles 

The  Pt  catalyst  undergoes  serious  degradation  in  the  load 
changing process, which originates from the effects of other com- 
ponents  and  operating  conditions.  First,  ionomer  redistribution 
may lead to a loss in ECSA ( Fig. 15 (b)). Second, once cracks form 
in the CL, Pt particles in or around the cracks are more likely to 
be detached from the carbon support and washed away due to the 
fact that water tends to ﬂow through cracks [227] . Third, Pt parti- 
cles are forced to cluster or detach due to corrosion of the carbon 
support in the starvation process (see Fig. 5 (b) and (d)). Notice- 
ably,  potential  cycling  is  a  key  factor  in  catalyst  aging,  which  is 
unavoidable to some extent, especially when carbon corrosion is 
insigniﬁcant. Potential cycling is extensively applied to investigate 
the intrinsic stability and durability of the catalyst. 

4.2.3.1. Aging state of the catalyst.  In in-situ current cycling dura- 
bility tests, degradation of the ECSA and the growth of Pt particles 
are frequently observed in the literature. Liu et al. [222] reported 
a 55% ECSA loss after a 900 h driving cycle test, and Shan et al. 
[225] reported a 48% ECSA loss after 200 driving cycles. Bose et al. 
[259] evaluated the evolution of overpotentials in a 10-cell stack 
under dynamic load condition. An increase in kinetic loss, mainly 
related  to  the  catalyst  state,  dominated  the  degradation  process 
from  240  to  480  h.  Guétaz  et  al.  [199]  analyzed  catalyst  degra- 
dation in several areas of a fuel cell. They noticed two distribu- 
tions of Pt particles in the cathode after AST, and suggested that 
the well-dispersed larger particles are the result of Ostwald ripen- 
ing. In contrast, carbon corrosion leads to an uneven distribution of 
large Pt agglomerates. Indeed, Ostwald ripening ( Fig. 5 (a)) makes 
major contribution to catalyst aging in potential cycling [260] , and 
ultimately leads to a decrease in the ECSA and an increase in ki- 
netic loss [ 261 , 262 ]. In this section, we focus on potential cycling 
in the normal range of fuel cell operation, generally between 0.6 
and 1.0 V, as analyzed in section 4.1 . The effect of carbon corro- 
sion can be eliminated to some extent in this potential range [263] . 
Moreover, catalyst dissolution and coarsening are coupled together 
in potential cycling. Particle growth and ECSA loss are pronounced 
after potential cycling, as provided in Table S4. To further under- 
stand the aging mechanism, we must trace back to Ostwald ripen- 
ing, especially the mechanism of electrochemical Ostwald ripening 
in a fuel cell. 

4.2.3.2. Ostwald ripening of the catalyst in a fuel cell.  A decrease in 
particle surface  energy  drives Ostwald  ripening, whereby Pt  dis- 
solves from small particles into the ionomer and then redeposites 
on big particles. The Ostwald-Freundlich equation, which is equiv- 
alent to the Gibbs–Thomson equation, describes the dependence of 
the solubility on the curvature of a particle [264-266] :

vation. As shown in Fig. 16 (b), the pressure in the local starvation 
area decreases, thus leading to intensiﬁed air permeation through 
the membrane. As a result, an air/H 
2 boundary appears in the an- 
ode, and carbon corrosion in the cathode is exacerbated, especially 
in  the  local  region  directly  facing  the  local  starvation  area.  This 
mechanism is consistent with that under startup-shutdown con- 
dition, which will be discussed in section 5.2.1 . The aging mecha- 
nism of local fuel starvation has been validated by Patterson et al. 
[248] , who used a locally Kynar-impregnated anodic GDL to cause 
local fuel starvation. Kynar impregnation hinders hydrogen trans- 
fer in the local area. They found the cathodic local area facing the 
anodic Kynar impregnation to be seriously damaged after 100 h, 
which was revealed by a change in thickness of the cathode CL. 
The destruction originates from the carbon corrosion in the cath- 
ode. Wang et al. [197] observed a localized reduction in cathode 
thickness from 9.5 to 3.4 μm after 10,0 0 0 in-situ dynamic load cy- 
cles. After load cycling tests, Guétaz et al. [199] found more severe 
agglomeration of Pt particles in the cathode around the air inlet as 
a result of carbon corrosion. Note that, in their study, the air in- 
let was near the H 
2  outlet where local fuel starvation is serious. 
Furthermore, severe hydrogen undersupply, especially that corre- 
sponding  to  a  stoichiometric  ratio  around  or  less  than  one,  will 
give rise to overall fuel starvation, which induces fuel cell aging 
quite differently from local starvation. The former leads to cell re- 
versal, whereas the latter leads to current reversal [249-252] . Once 
overall starvation occurs, the normal operation and load current of 
the fuel cell cannot be maintained. However, if there is an external 
power source to force the abnormal cell to sustain the current, cell 
reversal occurs. The external power source may be a potentiostat 
(galvanostatic operating mode) or the normally operating fuel cells 
in the same stack [249] . Actually, the abnormal fuel cell acts as an 
electrolyzer, as shown in Fig. 16 (c). The carbon oxidation reaction 
(COR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are induced in the an- 
ode to provide protons and maintain the load current. Hence, the 
anode potential increases rapidly, and simultaneously, the cell volt- 
age decreases. Liang et al. [253] investigated the transient process 
of overall hydrogen starvation by varying the stoichiometric ratio 
of hydrogen ( λ
H2 ). The evolution of the cell voltage is shown in Fig. 
17 . Lower values of λ
H2 result in lower cell voltages. A lower cell 
voltage, corresponding to a higher anode potential, means intensi- 
ﬁed COR and OER in the anode. When λ

Lim et al. [254] further validated the aging mechanism with differ- 
ent catalyst supports: carbon black and carbon nanocages. Depend-

Based on LSW theory, Moein-Jahromi et al. [265] conducted a 
simulation to predict the growth of Pt particles and the decrease 
in ECSA under load cycling condition. 

However, dissolution and transport of Pt atoms in the ionomer 
are quite diﬃcult, so the ordinary form of Ostwald ripening is al- 
most impossible in a fuel cell. Actually, Ostwald ripening of Pt par- 
ticles in a fuel cell occurs as an electrochemical process, known as 
electrochemical Ostwald ripening, in which the transport of Pt 2 + 
and electrons are coupled ( Fig. 18 (b)). Exactly, it is the concentra- 
tion and transport of Pt 2 + that are adopted in the Ostwald ripen- 
ing  model  described  in  Ref.  [265] .  In  order  to  understand  elec- 
trochemical Ostwald ripening in detail, the chemical potential and 
the electrochemical potential of components are elaborated as fol- 
lows. First, the chemical potential of spherical Pt particles deter- 
mines  the  instability  of  non-uniform  particle  sizes  and  distribu- 
tions [ 156 , 170 , 199 , 271-273 ]:

Obviously, (cid:2)(cid:10) is below zero, as shown in Fig. 18 . Thus, the po- 
tential gradient in the ionomer suppresses the transport of Pt 2 + 
from smaller particles to larger ones. That is, electrochemical Ost- 
wald  ripening  is  suppressed.  An  electrical  circuit  is  required  for 
ripening to  occur.  The  carbon  support  can  serve  as  an  electrical 
conductor  for  two  supported  Pt  particles  to  establish  an  electri- 
cal circuit (see Fig. 18 (b)). Electrons can thereby ﬂow from smaller 
particles to larger ones, once the particles are in contact or sin- 
tered, as shown in Fig. 18 (c). As  a result,  the irregular shape of 
sintered particle gradually transforms to the sphere shape. Sneed 
et al. [274] observed an increase in particle sphericity and a sharp 
decrease  in  the  particle  aspect  ratio,  accompanied  by  signiﬁcant 
particle growth, on three types of catalyst support after potential 
cycling, as shown in Fig. 19 . Their ﬁndings conﬁrm the process of 
Ostwald ripening in a fuel cell, especially by the mechanism shown 
in  Fig.  18 (c).  In addition,  the  electrolyte,  the  ionomer  in the  CL, 
plays an important role in the transfer of Pt 2 + ions. Poor ionic con- 
ductivity or lack of the ionomer restricts or even terminates elec- 
trochemical Ostwald ripening. 

In summary, the transport of Pt 2 +  and electrons, driven by a 
decrease in particle surface energy, are  essential and coupled  in 
electrochemical  Ostwald  ripening,  as  shown  in  Fig.  18 (b).  Once 
one of the transmission paths is blocked, electrochemical Ostwald 
ripening  is  slowed  or  even  terminated.  That  is,  the  intensity  of 
electrochemical  Ostwald  ripening  is  determined  jointly  by  parti- 
cle size and distribution, the conductivity of the catalyst support 
in  the  CL,  and  the  ionic  conductivity  of  the  ionomer  in  the  CL 
[ 170 , 199 , 271 , 272 ]: 

(a) Particle size and size distribution 
In electrochemical Ostwald ripening, large particles swell with 
the shrink of small particles, hence the average particle size in- 
creases together with a decrease in particle number, as shown in 
Fig. 18 (d). Hansen et al. [260] determined that catalyst coarsening 
evolves very fast at the early stage, corresponding to catalyst parti- 
cles with the diameter less than 3 nm. Ostwald ripening dominates 
the stage due to the very high surface energy, and that very small 
particles disappear drastically at the stage. By simulation, Holby et 
al. [170] revealed that catalyst particles with the diameter of ~2-3 
nm are prone to degradation. As a contrast, the particle diameter 
of ~4-5 nm makes the catalyst much more stable. Furthermore, it is 
explicable that the ECSA usually diminishes much more rapidly at 
the early stage of an AST and tends to become more stable later. It 
arises from the smaller average size of particles and the existence 
of  particles  with  very  tiny  size  at  the  early  stage.  Finally,  parti- 
cles grow to a stable size. Another size-related factor that affects 
catalyst decay is the particle size distribution. A narrow distribu- 
tion of particle sizes, representing uniform particle sizes, will slow 
down Ostwald ripening effectively [ 269 , 275 ]. Yano et al. [276] com- 
pared the degradation of Pt catalysts with different standard devi- 
ations ( σ
d ) in particle size, 10% and 20%, in potential cycling tests, 
as shown in Fig. 20 . The two Pt catalysts possess approximately 
the same average particle size and average interparticle distance.

diagram of particle growth in the process of Ostwald ripening, which is reprinted from Ref. [265] with permission of Elsevier. 

However, there is a signiﬁcant difference in the degradation pro- 
cess of the two catalysts, as reﬂected in the ECSA and particle size 
distribution shown in Fig. 20 . The Pt catalyst with the more uni- 
form particle size ( σ
d = 10%) coarsens more slowly, especially at the 
early stage (0-10 0 0 0 cycles in Fig. 20 (a)), which can be attributed 
to fewer very small particles included [276] . It is worth pointing 
out that very small particles force Ostwald ripening primarily. 

(b) Conductivity of the catalyst support 
The  carbon  support  helps  establish  the  circuit  that  is  indis- 
pensable  to  electrochemical  Ostwald  ripening.  Meanwhile,  it  de- 
termines  that  the  transfer  of  Pt  can  occur  only  if  the  particles 
are electrically connected. When Virkar et al. [156] used alumina, 
which  is  insulative,  to  support  Pt  particles,  almost  no  Pt  parti- 
cle growth was detected after one week maintaining at 80 °C. In 
contrast, signiﬁcant coarsening of Pt particles supported on carbon 
was observed. 

(c) Ionic conductivity of the ionomer 
The ionomer serves as the electrolyte of the micro-battery in 
electrochemical Ostwald ripening, where small Pt particles act as 

the anode and large Pt particles act as the cathode. The ionic con- 
ductivity of the ionomer is an important factor in electrochemical 
Ostwald ripening and particle growth. Water content is a signiﬁ- 
cant contributor to the ionic conductivity of the ionomer. Takei et 
al. [277] and Bi et al. [278] observed the diminished growth of Pt 
particles and degradation of the ECSA under low RH condition in a 
load cycling test, and attributed it partly to poor ionic conductivity 
of the ionomer with lower water content. The simulation results 
of Moein-Jahromi et al. [265] conﬁrmed this ﬁnding. Ohyagi et al. 
[279] further demonstrated a signiﬁcant impact of liquid water, in- 
dicated by the greatly intensiﬁed degradation of ECSA under su- 
persaturated condition (189% RH). Meanwhile, catalyst degradation 
is only accelerated slightly, with RH increasing from 20% to 100%. 
In addition, it should be emphasized that the presence of water 
enhances the oxidation and dissolution of Pt [ 277 , 279 , 280 ], which 
also intensiﬁes electrochemical Ostwald ripening.

cling [ 164 , 281-286 ], thus Pt migration and electrochemical Ostwald 
ripening  are  intensiﬁed.  On  the  one  hand,  Pt  deposition,  result- 
ing from Pt migration, in the membrane [ 199 , 281 , 287-289 ] and in 
the ionomer of the CL [287] after load cycling or potential cycling 
alone has been extensively observed. A remarkable phenomenon 
is  the  appearance  of  Pt  band  in  the  membrane,  which  reduces 
the Pt load of the electrode and affects the durability of the PFSA 
membrane, as discussed in section 3.2.3 . On the other hand, en- 
hanced  dissolution  of  the  Pt  catalyst  means  easier  separation  of 
Pt ions, or even Pt atoms, from particles and suﬃcient Pt ions in 
the ionomer, which enhances electrochemical Ostwald ripening. By 
comparing the growth of Pt particles in PtCl 
4 solution, dilute acid, 
and deionized water, Virkar et al. [156] conﬁrmed that a higher Pt 
ion concentration beneﬁts electrochemical Ostwald ripening. Par- 
4  solution,  but  it  hardly  occurs 
ticle  coarsening  is  severe  in  PtCl 
in  the  latter  two  liquids.  Neither  of  these  degradation  pathways 
for  the  Pt  catalyst  can  be  neglected.  Shao-Horn  et  al.  [287]  re- 
vealed that Ostwald ripening dominates catalyst decay away from 
the cathode/membrane interface in the thickness direction of the 
cathode, as shown in Fig. 21 . Meanwhile, Pt migration and rede- 
position are intensiﬁed close to the cathode/membrane interface, 
which is attributed to the existence of crossover hydrogen from the 
anode. 

We now focus on the mechanism of accelerated dissolution dur- 
ing potential cycling. Under potential cycling condition, a variety 
of  reaction  processes,  including  electrochemical  dissolution,  oxi- 
dation, chemical dissolution of Pt oxide, and reduction of Pt ox- 
ide,  occur  simultaneously  on  the  surfaces  of  Pt  particles.  There- 
fore,  obtaining  a  clear  understanding  of  the  mechanism  is  chal- 
lenging.  Many  researchers  have  tried  to  reveal  the  mechanism 
by  comparing  the  decrease  in  ECSA  and  catalyst  activity  during 
potential  cycling  with  different  proﬁles  [290-292] ,  upper  poten- 
tial  limits  [ 204 , 290 , 293 ],  lower  potential  limits  [283] ,  scan  rates 
[ 282 , 283 , 292 ], and durations (dwell time of the upper potential) 
[ 282 , 293 ]. Then, it comes to be realized that Pt dissolution during 
potential cycling is a transient process [ 282 , 292 , 293 ]. As an illus- 
tration, Topalov et al. [56] reported that the peak of Pt dissolution 
rate coincides with the potential step, whether positive-going or 
negative-going, and then decreases rapidly. In potential cycling, the 
potential range cannot reach the equilibrium potential of electro- 
chemical oxidation (Pt-2e −→ Pt 2 + , E 
0 = 1.188V vs. SHE), so electro- 
chemical dissolution of Pt is not dominant and is sometimes negli- 
gible. The Pt oxide, however, plays a crucial role. Using inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements to de-

tect the low rate of Pt dissolution, Topalov et al. [56] observed a 
double peak phenomenon in the dissolution rate during one tri- 
angular  potential  cycle,  as  shown  in  Fig.  22 .  The  lower  peak  in 
the anodic scan is insigniﬁcant. In contrast, the higher peak, which 
dominates the Pt dissolution process, appears in the cathodic scan 
and depends largely on the upper potential limit. Researchers have 
noticed the effect of sub-surface oxide on Pt dissolution [ 56 , 294- 
296 ]. Further, Topalov et al. [297] conducted a comprehensive in- 
vestigation of Pt dissolution and proposed an exhaustive explana- 
tion, the so-called place-exchange mechanism. As shown in Fig. 23 , 
in the anodic scan process, the dissolution of low-coordinated Pt 
atoms at the sites of defects, step edges, and islands results in the 
lower peak, and it is worth noting that the amount of dissolved Pt 
is quite small and the Pt surface as a whole remains stable. Mean-

while, Pt oxide forms and covers the Pt surface, which can further 
exchange places with underlying Pt atoms to become a sub-surface 
oxide. In the cathodic scan process, the reduction of Pt oxide, es- 
pecially the sub-surface oxide, leads to the severe dissolution of Pt 
atoms, especially the place-exchanged atoms, which explains the 
predominant dissolution peak. Moreover, the cathodic dissolution 
of Pt leaves plenty of low-coordinated Pt atoms, which are easily 
dissolved in the anodic scan process. The observed surface rough- 
ening and defect formation in other literature support the place- 
exchange mechanism [ 295 , 298 ]. The double-peak in the Pt dissolu- 
tion rate has been veriﬁed in subsequent literature [298-300] . Jo- 
vanovi ˇc et al. [300] even reported a signiﬁcant dependence of both 
anodic dissolution and cathodic dissolution on particle size. Note 
that, although the phenomenon can be clearly observed when the 
upper potential limit is above 1.1 [297] , 1.15 [56] , or 1.2 V [300] , 
as  reported,  we  conclude  that  the  place-exchange  mechanism  is 
also signiﬁcant in the normal potential range of 0.6-1.0 V. On the 
one hand, Pt oxide starts to form at a relatively low potential, re- 
ported to be 0.8 V in Refs. [ 283 , 298 ] and 0.6 V in Ref. [301] . Liu et 
al. [301] even reported the complete coverage by monolayer PtOH 
at 0.9 V on the basis of coulometric measurements in a fuel cell 
and the assumption that PtOH is the primary oxidation product. 
On the other hand, the effects of oxygen on Pt oxidation cannot 
be ignored in a fuel cell operating under real conditions [ 282 , 295 ]. 
Kongkanand et al. [294] revealed a decrease in the potential re- 
quired to drive place exchange between the surface oxide and Pt 
atoms in an oxygen atmosphere, and the potential is as low as 0.75 
V. 

The  place-exchange  mechanism  can  be  used  to  explain  the 
majority of issues encountered in potential cycling [ 282 , 299 , 302 ]. 
Schneider et al. [302] have applied it in modeling and simulation. 
Here, some observations from potential cycling tests are analyzed 
with  the  place-exchange  mechanism,  as  given  in  Table  S5.  Note 
that  the  formation  of  Pt  oxide  at  high  potentials,  its  reduction, 
and cathodic dissolution are coupled, jointly dominating Pt disso- 
lution and degradation. Moreover, these processes take some time 
to reach the ﬁnal state [ 203 , 283 , 292 , 293 ], corresponding to a stable 
surface oxide coverage and complete reduction. These factors form 
the basis of the analysis in Table S5, which focuses on the high po- 
tential to which the catalyst is exposed, the duration of exposure, 
and the conditions for reduction of Pt oxide. 

5. startup-shutdown condition 

Startup-shutdown  condition  is  quite  special,  which  results  in 
abnormal reactions in the fuel cell. Here, the core factor acceler- 
ating  fuel  cell  aging  is  the  interfacial  potential  difference  at  the 
cathode, which is as high as 1.5 V, resulting from the air-hydrogen 
boundary in the anode. The carbon support, which constitutes the 
main  framework  of  the  CL,  in  the  cathode  becomes  badly  cor- 
roded, and consequently the Pt catalyst and the ionomer are af- 
fected.  Further,  the  cathode  structure  deteriorates  and  can  even 
collapse, which adversely affects the ECSA, charge transfer resis- 
tance, and mass transfer resistance. Thus, it is essential to develop 
materials with a high tolerance to high potentials (above the nor- 
mal potential range) and control strategies for startup-shutdown. 
Cold start, which is a particular case of the startup condition, is 
treated separately in section 5.4 , mainly involving degradation in- 
duced by freezing-thawing. 

5.1. AST of startup-shutdown 

channels are purged with the feed hydrogen in the startup pro- 
cess. In the shutdown procedure, the air-hydrogen boundary ap- 
pears in the anode because air diffuses from the cathode or the 
anode outlet if it is open to the atmosphere. Even if air purging 
is performed during shutdown, an air-hydrogen boundary will also 
arise for a very short period. Consequently, this produces an ex- 
treme cathode potential that may induce the severe carbon cor- 
rosion, which will be elaborated in section 5.2.1 . The AST meth- 
ods of startup-shutdown vary with research objectives, as summa- 
rized in Table S6. Only some typical AST methods are listed. These 
AST methods are conducted to simulate the air-hydrogen boundary 
in the anode and the high cathode potential, corresponding to in- 
situ and ex-situ AST methods, respectively. First, startup-shutdown 
procedures,  involving  gas  supply  and  loading,  can  be  conducted 
rapidly and repeatedly to hasten fuel cell aging, which most closely 
approximates real startup-shutdown condition, as shown in Refs. 
[303-305] . This AST method is typically used to evaluate the effects 
of startup-shutdown procedure optimization [ 33 , 304 , 306 , 307 ] and 
condition parameters such as operating temperature [308] , relative 
gas humidity [ 309 , 310 ], and oxygen partial pressure [311] . Second, 
air and hydrogen are alternately fed to the anode to simulate the 
air-hydrogen boundary in the anode [312-316] , which is a highly 
effective in-situ AST method. Third, based on an understanding of 
the cause of aging under startup-shutdown condition, a high po- 
tential is imposed on the cathode in potentiostatic or dynamic po- 
tential tests. In the potentiostatic test, the potential imposed on the 
cathode, mainly ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 V, can induce severe car- 
bon corrosion. In the literature, 1.2 [317] , 1.3 [ 318 , 319 ], 1.4 [ 92 , 320- 
322 ], and 1.5 V [323] , with reference to the anode supplied with 
H 
2 , have all been reported. It is worth noting that reversible loss 
in the steady-state AST may be signiﬁcant and requires elimina- 
tion. For this purpose, Zhang et al. [ 92 , 320 , 322 ] employed a recov- 
ery voltage cycle (0.2 V-OCV, step: 0.1 V) after the potentiostatic 
AST. The potential cycling test, which simulates startup-shutdown, 
can be classiﬁed into two categories in terms of its lower poten- 
tial limit. In the ﬁrst case, researchers have chosen a higher lower 
potential limit, generally above 1 V, to isolate Pt dissolution and 
growth and study only carbon corrosion and its subsequent effects. 
For example, a symmetric triangular wave (1.0-1.5 V, scan rate: 500 
mV • s −1 ) is typically used and has been adopted by the DOE and 
FCCJ [ 8 , 207 , 324-326 ]. These potential cycling tests, together with 
the  potentiostatic  test,  induce  the  surface  passivation  of  Pt  par- 
ticles [ 322 , 327 ]. That is, the Pt particles become covered with a 
stable Pt oxide layer that prevents the dissolution and subsequent 
growth  of  Pt  particles.  Moreover,  Pt  oxide  cannot  be  reduced  at 
the relatively high potential. Topalov et al. [297] conducted an ex- 
situ potential cycling test with a ﬁxed upper potential limit, 1.55 V, 
and a variable lower potential limit, 0.05-1.05 V, and detected the 
real-time Pt dissolution rate, as Fig. 24 shows. An elevated lower 
potential limit leads to a decrease in Pt dissolution. Pt dissolution 
is almost fully suppressed with the lower potential limit of 1.05 V, 
which is indicative of surface passivation. In this scenario, degrada- 
tion of the Pt catalyst and the subsequent decrease in ECSA origi- 
nate primarily from carbon corrosion. In the second case, the lower 
potential limit is extended to the normal range of voltages, corre- 
sponding  to  the  potentials  encountered  in  the  startup-shutdown 
process. Here, carbon corrosion and Pt degradation itself are cou- 
pled in the potential cycling test. For example, a potential range 
of 0.6-1.4 V is applied in Refs. [ 328 , 329 ]. In some ex-situ experi- 
ments, researchers have extended the lower potential limit to 0.5 
[330] , 0.4 [ 331 , 332 ] or even 0.1 V [333] . 

5.2. Degradation mechanisms under startup-shutdown condition 

Fuel cell degradation under startup-shutdown originates from 
2  and  air  in  the  anode,  represented  by  the 
the  coexistence  of  H 
air-hydrogen boundary. Generally, the air-ﬁlled anode and anodic 

The carbon support bears the brunt of the relatively high cath- 
ode  potential  under  startup-shutdown  condition,  which  is  gov-

resistance attributed to the small membrane thickness [334] and 
the surface passivation of Pt particles [ 322 , 327 ]. Neglect of in-plane 
proton transfer allows the electrolyte in the two regions to be con- 
sidered separately. Thus, the entire fuel cell under the condition of 
startup-shutdown consists of a fuel cell and an electrolyzer, cor- 
responding to the left and right regions, respectively, as Fig. 25 (b) 
shows. The GDL and polar plate, which conduct electrons, can be 
thought of as the external wires. This is also known as the dual- 
cell mechanism, which is equivalent to the reverse current mecha- 
nism. The mechanisms have been veriﬁed by experiments. Tang et 
al. [315] carried out a dual-cell experiment, in which two fuel cells 
sharing serial gas paths are connected electrically. They detected 
current between the cells upon exchange of the anode gas between 
air and reformate. Based on the dual-cell hypothesis, Sidik et al. 
[335] analyzed an electrical circuit composed of the fuel cell and 
electrolyzer. At steady state, the voltage of the two parts should be 
equal ( U 
Electrolyzer , as shown in Fig. 26 ), and thus the positive 
electrode potential of the electrolyzer reaches:

where E is the potential, the subscripts designate either the elec- 
trolyzer  or  the  fuel  cell,  the  superscripts  designate  the  reaction 
type (see Fig. 25 (b)). Generally, E ORR 
Cell  due to 
differences in the Pt loading and ECSA between the anode and the 
cathode, although the current is the same. Note that only when the 
fuel cell and electrolyzer possess equal active areas, the average 
current density is the same. As Eq. (5) shows, at the same current 
density, the overpotential of the anode is greater than that of the 
cathode due to the lower roughness, L 
Electrolyzer 
is  lower  than  E ORR 
Cell ,  which  is  neglected  by  Sidik  et  al.  [335] ,  as 
shown in Fig. 26 . Thus, even if E HOR 
Electrolyzer is lower 
than twice the cell voltage in the dual-cell experiment. Of course, 
the active areas of the two cells and the current densities should 
be the same in this comparison. Furthermore, the above analysis 
is  conﬁrmed  by  the  investigation  of  Eom  et  al.  [303]  on  anodic 
Pt  loading.  They  observed  relief  from  fuel  cell  degradation  with 
lower anodic Pt loading during startup-shutdown cycling, revealed 
by  performance,  alternating-current  impedance,  and  ECSA  mea- 
surements. Especially, the initial cathode thickness of 15.4 μm de- 
creases to 7.3 and 12.0 μm with anodic Pt loadings of 0.4 and 0.1 
mg • cm −2 , respectively, after 10 0 0 startup-shutdown cycles, reveal- 
ing a signiﬁcant difference in carbon corrosion. Eom et al. [303] at- 
tributed  the  result  to  a  decrease  in  the  ORR  rate  in  the  anode, 
which is consistent with the implication in Fig. 26 . That is, a re- 
duction in the anodic Pt loading leads to a decline of the E ORR 
Electrolyzer 
curve, and thus the steady-state current density, the reverse cur- 
rent, and E COR , OER 

Electrolyzer differs from E ORR

Electrolyzer all decrease. 

Researchers  have  devoted  considerable  attention  to  the  char- 
acteristics of the startup-shutdown process based on the reverse 
current mechanism. Shen et al. [336] constructed a three-electrode 
structure by introducing a hydrogen reference electrode and used 
two thin copper wires to measure the electrolyte potential near the 
anode inlet and outlet. The air/hydrogen boundary gives rise to a 
signiﬁcant electrolyte potential difference between the anode inlet 
and outlet, which reaches 0.8 V, thus leading to a cathode inter- 
facial potential difference of approximately 1.6 V near the anode 
outlet.  By  introducing  an  edge-type  dynamic  hydrogen  electrode

V vs. DHE in the gas-exchange process. Wang et al. [338] likewise 
detected a cathode potential peak of 1.7 V vs. DHE when purging 
the air-ﬁlled anode with H

istics  of  current  density  and  degradation  and  to  further  validate 
the  reverse  current  mechanism,  segmented  fuel  cells  have  been 
used extensively in investigations of startup-shutdown [339-347] .

erned by the reverse current mechanism. The resultant carbon cor- 
rosion  induces  Pt  degradation  and  damage  to  the  CL  structure, 
which negatively impacts charge transfer and mass transfer. In this 
section, these contents will be elaborated. 

5.2.1. Reverse current mechanism 

Under the condition of startup-shutdown, a relatively large in- 
terfacial potential difference arises in the local cathode region and 
endangers the cathode components and structure. The local cath- 
ode region is just corresponding to the anode area that is exposed 
to  air.  To  account  for  the  phenomenon,  Reiser  et  al.  [334]  pro- 
posed  the  reverse  current  mechanism  and  modeled  the  process. 
As shown in Fig. 25 , the anode is simultaneously exposed to hy- 
drogen and air under the condition of startup-shutdown. Thus, an 
air/hydrogen boundary is established, and the fuel cell is divided 
into two regions, the left and right regions in Fig. 25 (a). Moreover, 
the boundary moves towards and away from the anode exit under 
startup and shutdown, respectively. In the left region, normal fuel 
cell reactions occur at both electrodes: the HOR at the anode, and 
the ORR at the cathode. Meanwhile, the GDL and the polar plate, 
which possess good electrical conductivity, connect the anode and 
the cathode in both regions, making the entire anode and the en- 
tire  cathode  equipotential  respectively.  Of  course,  this  condition 
neglects the in-plane potential drop in the GDL and polar plate. 
The ORR in the local anode, which is exposed to air, further low- 
ers the ionomer potential of the right region. Hence, the interfacial 
potential difference in the right cathode region rises substantially 
to ~1.5 V, which intensiﬁes the COR and OER in the cathode and 
leads to carbon corrosion (see section 5.2.2 ). In the right region, 
protons produced by the COR and OER transfer from the cathode 
to the anode, generating the so-called reverse current. As shown 
in Fig. 25 (c) from Ref. [334] , the cathode potential ( V m c ) and an- 
ode  potential  ( V m a )  equal  0.85  V  and  0  V,  respectively,  and  the 
ionomer potential in the right region decreases to -0.593 V, which 
establishes the interfacial potential difference of 1.443 V. The one- 
dimensional model explains the basic electrochemical characteris- 
tics of the startup-shutdown process, although it ignores in-plane 
proton transfer in the membrane (between the two regions), reac- 
tions involving the Pt catalyst, and the mixed potential of the an- 
ode exposed to both hydrogen and air. However, this model is rea- 
sonable to some degree, because of the very high in-plane proton

structed a hydrogen reference electrode in a segmented fuel cell 
and  measured  the  cathode  potential  of  each  segment  along  the 
gas-exchange process. Taking the reference MEA (carbon support: 
Pt • cm −²) as an 
Vulcan XC72, anode/cathode Pt loading: 0.1/0.2 mg 
example (see Fig. 28 ), the segment cathode potential rises in syn- 
chrony with the reverse current and decreases rapidly when the 
segment current converts to positive. The local cathode potential 
reaches up to 1.5 V. With different carbon supports and Pt load- 
ings applied, variation tendencies of the local current density and 
cathode potential are the same. 

The reactions of Pt are ignored in the above analysis, although 
Pt  affects  the  electrochemical  properties  and  degradation  of  the 
fuel cell in the startup-shutdown process. Moreover, the effects dif- 
fer between startup and shutdown [ 314 , 349 , 350 ]. As shown in Fig. 
25 (a), in the startup process, reduction of PtOH in the local anode 
exposed to air requires protons and electrons, which intensiﬁes the 
COR and OER in the corresponding cathode area. In contrast, oxi- 
dation of Pt-H 
ad in the shutdown process produces protons, which 
relieves the reverse current and carbon corrosion in the cathode. 
This pseudo-capacitive effect originates from the reduction and ox- 
idation  of  PtOH  and  Pt-H 
ad ,  making  a  difference  to  startup  and 
shutdown [ 314 , 349 , 350 ]. In the cathode, the high potential in the 
startup-shutdown process induces the reaction [350] : 

PtOH − e 

− → PtO + H 

+ , 

(34) 

which relieves carbon corrosion regardless of startup or shutdown. 
Consequently, carbon corrosion is more severe during startup than 
shutdown  given  the  same  extent  of  the  air/hydrogen  boundary 
in the fuel cell, as reported in Refs. [ 314 , 349 , 350 ]. Moreover, un- 
der  controlled  conditions,  the  experimental  results  (carbon  loss 
in  shutdown/carbon  loss  in  startup = 0.58)  in  Ref.  [314]  match 
those of the simulation (carbon loss in shutdown/carbon loss in

cycling in a fuel cell with 20 segments. The segments produce a 
forward current sequentially as the hydrogen/air boundary moves 
from segment 1 to segment 20. Meanwhile, a distinct reverse cur- 
rent appears in the latter segments where the anode is exposed 
to  air  at  an  early  stage.  Thus,  the  internal  current  and  the  op- 
eration of the local part as an electrolyzer are conﬁrmed in the 
startup-shutdown process. Similar observations have been reported 
in Refs. [ 340-342 , 344 , 346-348 ]. Moreover, Lottin et al. [341] con-

By the way, other oxidation products are also possible. How- 
ever,  carbon  corrosion  is  almost  neglected  in  the  normal  poten- 
tial range due to the slow kinetics [ 305 , 321 , 333 ]. Schulenburg et 
2 emission in gas-exchange cycling and po- 
al. [313] compared CO 
tential  cycling  (0.6  V-OCV).  In  our  estimation,  the  former  even 
reaches 40 ppm • cm −2 at some moments, whereas the latter is al- 
ways  less  than  1  ppm • cm −2 .  Katayanagi  et  al.  [207]  found  little 
change in the shape of carbon particles after potential cycling (0.6- 
1.0 V), indicating almost no carbon corrosion. It is widely recog- 
nized that a potential higher than 1.2 V induces severe carbon cor- 
rosion [ 24 , 318 , 333 , 357-360 ]. Kim et al. [337] monitored gas emis- 
sion from the cathode by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry 
along  with  cathode  potential,  as  shown  in  Fig.  29 .  The  relation- 
ship between product and potential is evident. A potential higher 
2  generation,  which  is  the 
than  ~1.0  V  signiﬁcantly  enhances  CO 
dominant corrosion product. Meanwhile, CO and SO 
2  are formed 
at potentials higher than 1.2 V. Dhanushkodi et al. [328] revealed 
that carbon corrosion increases with cathode potential by impos- 
ing a rectangular potential wave with different upper limits. By ﬁx- 
ing the lower potential limit at 1.0 V, they found that carbon loss 
almost doubled as the upper potential limit increased from 1.42 
to  1.5  V.  In  addition,  the  Pt  catalyst  in  the  cathode  CL  can  cat- 
alyze and intensify carbon corrosion [ 318 , 352 , 354 , 361-364 ]. Roen 
et al. [352] reported an intensiﬁcation of carbon corrosion with in- 
creasing Pt mass fraction by on-line mass spectroscopy. Yu et al. 
[354] compared the extent of carbon corrosion in Pt/HSAC and in 
HSAC alone at a constant potential of 1.2 V ( vs. RHE). At the early 
stage, especially the ﬁrst 200 min, they observed greater enhance- 
ment of carbon corrosion from Pt/HSAC. Differences in the carbon 
corrosion rate almost vanished thereafter, which was attributed to 
surface passivation and a decline in activity of the Pt catalyst. Car- 
bon corrosion in the GDL is limited due to the absence of Pt cata- 
lyst, despite the high potential in the startup-shutdown process.

fect into consideration. Here, it is worth noting that the pseudo- 
capacitive effect is closely associated with Pt loading at both elec- 
trodes and other condition factors including humidity.

5.2.2.1. Carbon corrosion and structural damage induced by high po-

ode exposes the carbon support in the corresponding region to oxi- 
2 and CO, a change in morphology 
dation, leading to emission of CO 
and structure of the CL, and hastening of catalyst degradation. Ac- 
tually, carbon oxidation occurs at a relatively low equilibrium po-

cathode.  Lin  et  al.  [367]  accelerated  fuel  cell  aging  by  simulat- 
ing actual startup-shutdown procedures and observed similar phe- 
nomena, as shown in Fig. 30 (d)-(f). The shrink of cathode thickness 
indicates that the local cathode, which faces the anode outlet, de- 
cays most seriously. Lamibrac et al. [345] , Durst et al. [339] , and 
Kreitmeier et al. [314] reported the same results. Fig. 28 (b) shows 
the transient cathode potential of segments in a segmented fuel 
2 purging, which simulates the startup process. Appar- 
cell during H 
ently, the segment near the anode outlet suffers a higher cathode 
potential for a longer duration. Moreover, Durst et al. [339] moni- 
tored the current density distribution at 500 mA • cm −2 after an AST 
(see Fig. 27 (d)), in which the startup process dominates fuel cell 
2 purging velocity. Apparently, the cur- 
aging due to a quite low H 
rent density distribution curve gradually leans to the anode out- 
let (corresponding to segment 20). That is, the local current den- 
sity near the anode inlet increases to compensate for that near the 
outlet in response to the severe degradation near the anode outlet. 
It must be noted that speciﬁc steps in the startup-shutdown pro- 
cedure may make some differences and the local gas atmosphere 
plays a decisive role.

5.2.2.3. Non-uniform degradation between channel and land.  Carbon 
corrosion and related morphological changes vary between the CL 
under channels and lands [ 325 , 329 , 339 , 371 ], attributed to internal 
mass  transport  in  the  startup-shutdown  process  and  local  stress 
conditions. Ghosh et al. [325] observed more severe carbon corro- 
sion in the CL facing channels via potential cycling tests (1.0-1.5 
V), in which N 
2 were supplied to the cathode and anode, 
respectively. The local cathode thickness and porosity explicitly re- 
ﬂect the differences in deterioration, although the portions under 
lands actually suffer from stress. They attributed it to the lower ac- 
cessibility of water vapor under the land, which participates in the 
reaction of carbon corrosion. White et al. [329] encountered similar 
phenomena, and attributed the lower corrosion rate under lands 
to limitations in gas diffusion. However, these studies did not con- 
sider the gas atmosphere in the anode. Durst et al. [339] reported 
the opposite result in their gas-exchange experiment. In their in- 
vestigation, the air/hydrogen boundary dominates carbon corrosion 
in the cathode. In the startup process, the diffusion of hydrogen 
from channels to the CL under lands consumes some time. Thus, 
the air/hydrogen boundary that quickly forms between the CL un- 
der channels and lands results in more severe carbon corrosion in 
the local cathode facing the anode lands. It is worth noting that 
the fuel cell in Ref. [339] possesses symmetric anode and cathode 
channels. Therefore, the local cathode under cathode lands is de- 
graded  more  seriously,  based  on  the  resulting  cathode  thickness 
and porosity. Of course, the compaction force from the lands also 
makes a difference. Schneider et al. [371] measured the local cur- 
rent densities corresponding to the land and channel in the gas 
purging process (as shown in Fig. 31 ). Due to the time required 
2 - 
for  mass  transfer  to  the  local  CL  under  the  land,  transient  H 
starvation in the startup process and transient H 
2 -surplus in the 
shutdown  process  lead  to  more  serious  carbon  corrosion  in  the 
local  cathode  facing  the  anode  lands  and  channels,  respectively. 
In Fig. 31 , the negative current density indicates carbon oxidation 
in the corresponding local cathode.  Results in Ref. [339] and Ref. 
[371] are actually consistent. In summary, three factors determine 
the difference in carbon corrosion between the land and channel: 
the  accessibility  of  reactant  (water  vapor)  in  the  cathode,  com- 
paction by the land, and mass transfer of reactants (H 
2  and air) 
in the anode. 

5.2.3. Pt degradation mainly induced by carbon corrosion 

Carbon corrosion gives rise to an increase in ohmic resistance 
and a decrease in the ECSA. Carbon corrosion damages the elec- 
tric conductor in the cathode and forces reconstruction of the elec-

Carbon  corrosion  damages  the  framework  of  the  cathode 
CL.  Table  S7  summarizes  carbon  corrosion  and  induced  struc- 
tural  damage  of  the  cathode  in  the  literature  involving  startup- 
shutdown. Intensiﬁed CO 
2 emission [ 313 , 314 , 321 , 333 , 350 , 363 , 365 ], 
reduction  of  carbon  particle  size  [ 207 , 366 ],  holes  in  the  carbon 
support  [ 312 , 318 ],  and  shrink  of  cathode  thickness  [ 33 , 303 , 305 , 
306 , 311 , 314 , 315 , 323 , 333 , 334 , 339 , 345 , 367-370 ] are widely observed 
in in-situ and ex-situ AST experiments. The ﬁrst three phenomena 
are direct consequences of carbon corrosion, whereas the ﬁnal ob- 
servation results from compression. Carbon corrosion weakens the 
structural strength of the cathode, which makes the CL structure 
prone to collapse under upon compaction. It also explains why a 
decrease in cathode thickness is generally detected. Fig. 30 shows 
typical morphological changes of the cathode under the condition 
of  startup-shutdown,  in  which  (a)-(c)  show  holes  in  the  carbon 
support and (d)-(f) show the shrink of cathode thickness. Further, 
carbon corrosion in the cathode is non-uniform due to differences 
in the local gas atmosphere. 

5.2.2.2. Non-uniform degradation between the anode inlet and outlet. 
The air/hydrogen boundary moves from the anode inlet to the out- 
let during H 
2 purging at startup. Thus, the anode outlet is always 
exposed  to  air,  and  the  corresponding  local  cathode  suffers  the 
most serious carbon corrosion. At shutdown, if there is air purging 
in the anode, the anode inlet is exposed to air for a relatively long 
time.  Therefore,  in-plane  carbon  corrosion  differs  greatly  among 
the anode inlet, center, and outlet. Ishigami et al. [312] conducted a 
gas-exchange experiment, consisting of alternant H 
2 and air purg- 
ing from the anode inlet. As Fig. 30 (a)-(c) show, the inlet and out- 
let  suffer  severe  carbon  corrosion,  as  indicated  by  holes  in  the

given  in  Table  S7,  ECSA  reduction  resulting  from  Pt  agglomera- 
tion  and  detachment  is  widely  reported  in  the  literature.  Pt  ag- 
glomeration (as shown in Fig. 5 (b)) leads to particle growth. Loss 
of the carbon support increases the possibility of Pt detachment 
(as shown in Fig. 5 (d)), which decreases the Pt load. Fig. 32 dis- 
plays IL-TEM  images of  Pt/C  before and after  a  potential cycling 
test (1.0-1.5 V), revealing pronounced Pt agglomeration and detach- 
ment. Pt agglomeration [ 308 , 313 , 323 , 331 , 368 , 372-374 ] and Pt de- 
tachment [ 316 , 331 , 366 , 372 ] after startup-shutdown AST are widely 
documented in the literature. 

5.2.4. Effects on mass transfer 

Carbon corrosion leads to large changes in the composition and 
morphology  of  the  cathode  CL,  and  consequently,  mass  transfer 
is hindered. Fuel cell performance and reliability depend on mass 
transfer to a great extent. Three principal factors affect mass trans- 
fer under the condition of startup-shutdown: 

5.2.4.1. Ionomer redistribution in the CL.  Loss of the carbon frame- 
work  forces  redistribution  of  the  ionomer  in  the  cathode  CL,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  15  (b).  One  drawback  is  that  ionomer  redistribu- 
tion leads to uncovered and over-covered Pt particles, which not 
only decreases the ECSA but also hinders mass transfer to the ac- 
tive surface of over-covered Pt particles. Another drawback is that 
it weakens water transport in the cathode, consequently increas- 
ing the possibility of water ﬂooding. Katayanagi et al. [207] directly 
observed ionomer agglomeration after potential cycling (1.0-1.5 V). 
Venkatesan et al. [229] compared cross-sectional ﬂuorine maps of 
the  cathode  CL  before  and  after  AST,  as  shown  in  Fig.  33 .  Dis- 
tinctly, uniform ionomer distribution becomes heterogeneous, leav- 
ing large ionomer agglomerates and vacancies. 

5.2.4.2. Porosity  decay  in  the  CL.  Carbon  corrosion  weakens  the 
framework of the cathode CL, making the cathode structure prone 
to collapse and consequently decreasing the cathode porosity. Note 
that the decrease in porosity is general but not absolute. It is re- 
lated to the cathode structural strength and compaction forces. For 
example, Park et al. [318] and Ishigami et al. [312] reported the 
existence of enlarged pores in the cathode. Durst et al. [339] de- 
tected a slight increase in porosity from ~52% to ~55% under chan- 
nels and a signiﬁcant reduction under lands. Meyer et al. [375] also

tron pathway, which further increases the ohmic resistance of the 
cathode  together  with  the  contact  resistance,  as  detected  by  Oh 
et  al.  [321] ,  Zhang  et  al.  [322] ,  and  Park  et  al.  [318] .  Pt  catalyst 
degradation is greatly accelerated by carbon support corrosion. As

especially in the medium and low frequency range involving oxy- 
gen transfer, which provides support to the hypothesis. 

5.3. Inﬂuencing factors and mitigation measures 

Carbon  corrosion  at  relatively  high  potentials  is  impacted 
by  condition  parameters.  As  reported,  higher  gas  humid- 
ity  [ 309 , 310 , 314 , 379 , 380 ]  and  higher  operating  temperature 
[ 308 , 314 , 337 , 379 ] accelerate carbon corrosion. In addition, carbon 
corrosion can be controlled by optimizing startup-shutdown pro- 
cedures,  as  reviewed  in  Refs.  [ 30 , 381 , 382 ].  Table  S8  summarizes 
the mitigation measures that have been applied in the literature. 
The  basic  strategy  is  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  effect  of  the 
air/hydrogen  boundary.  Here,  we  address  measures  taken  in  the 
shutdown  process.  First,  rapid  elimination  of  residual  hydrogen 
in  the  anode  reduces  the  residence  time  of  the  air/hydrogen 
boundary,  which  signiﬁcantly  relieves  carbon  corrosion.  It  is  ef- 
fective  to  purge  the  anode [ 345 , 365 , 383 ] or  introduce  a  dummy 
load  to  consume  residual  hydrogen  [ 304 , 338 , 369 , 384 ].  Second, 
it  is  feasible  to  cut  off the  air  source  and  to  eliminate  residual 
air.  For  this  purpose,  researchers  have  used  a  closed-ended  fuel 
cell to interdict air diffusion from the ambient atmosphere after 
shutdown. Yu et al. [306] and Yamashita et al. [363] chose to cut 
off the air supply prior to hydrogen termination in their shutdown 
procedures. Oyarce et al. [307] even conducted reformate purging 
in  the  cathode.  Moreover,  a  dummy  load  can  also  be  used  to 
consume  residual  oxygen  [ 33 , 304 , 306 , 338 , 369 , 384-386 ].  Finally, 
researchers  have  tried  to  develop  and  utilize  corrosion-resistant 
catalyst  support  materials,  such  as  ﬂuorinated  carbon  [387] , 
graphite [ 321 , 388 ], carbon nanoﬁbers [389] , and carbon nanotubes 
[ 390 , 391 ]. 

5.4. Freezing-thawing induced by cold start 

Environmental adaptability is of great importance for the auto- 
motive PEM fuel cell. Operation at subzero temperatures and cold 
start are essential considerations. This section features fuel cell de- 
cay induced by cold start. Of course, serving as a particular case of 
the startup condition, cold start gives rise to the same degradation 
mechanism reviewed in section 5.2 . One difference is the freezing 
of water in the process. On the one hand, solid ice may block mass 
transfer paths, thereby causing gas starvation. Xie et al. [392] re- 
ported  voltage  reversal  at  an  early  stage  of  a  galvanostatic  cold 
start, which returned to normal after a while due to the heat gen- 
erated in the reversal process. They attributed the voltage reversal

tribution, (a) before and (b) after potential cycling (0.6-1.3 V, 4700 cycles). Adapted

attributed a 45% decrease in ﬁtted mass transfer resistance after 
the  ﬁrst  100  carbon-corrosion  AST  cycles  to  a  porosity  increase 
(see Fig. 34 ), although a subsequent structural collapse sharply in- 
creased the mass transfer resistance. In general, however, a poros- 
ity decrease comes out along with the shrink of cathode thickness. 
Fig. 35 shows a typical example. Porosity decreases from 40 ±3% 
to 5 ±3% after 10 0 0 gas-exchange cycles accompanied by shrink of 
pore size and cut-off of connected pores [313] . A decrease in poros- 
ity increases the diﬃculty in mass transfer. Moreover, closed pores 
are prone to form as structural collapse proceeds [325] , which fur- 
ther hinders mass transfer. Closed porosity is reported to increase 
from 0 to 2 ±2% after 10 0 0 startup-shutdown cycles [313] . 

5.2.4.3. Surface hydrophilization of the carbon support.  As noted in 
2 are not the only reaction products of car- 
section 5.2.2 , CO and CO 
bon corrosion. Formation of oxygen-containing groups is also pos- 
sible [ 376 , 377 ]. Surface oxidation of the carbon support may pro- 
duce some hydrophilic groups, which attach to the carbon surface 
and decrease the surface hydrophobicity [ 317 , 318 , 320 , 322 , 377 , 378 ]. 
As a result, water transport becomes more diﬃcult. That is, water 
tends to accumulate in a degraded cathode, leading to a thicker 
water  ﬁlm  in  the  CL  and  hindering  mass  transfer  (as  shown  in 
Fig. 36 (b)). Park et al. [318] detected a signiﬁcant increase in mass 
transfer  resistance  in  their  potentiostatic  (1.3  V)  AST,  especially 
at  higher  current  density,  as  shown  in  Fig.  36 (a).  However,  Hg 
porosimetry detected an increase in porosity ( Fig. 36 (c)). They at- 
tributed this to surface hydrophilization of the carbon support and 
conducted an electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) detection 
at different humidity. As shown in Fig. 36 (d), the impedance spec- 
trum after aging is much more sensitive to humidity than before,

frequent cold starts, together with shutdowns at subzero temper- 
atures, result in frequent water-ice phase transitions, or freezing- 
thawing cycles. Freezing-thawing cycles can physically damage al- 
most all components in the MEA. The extent of damage depends 
on water distribution and local physical conditions throughout the 
fuel cell. 

AST of freezing-thawing has been carried out by inducing fre- 
quent water-ice phase transitions in a fuel cell primarily by tem- 
perature control. Reported lower temperature limits include -5 °C 
in Ref. [393] , -10 °C in Refs. [ 394 , 395 ], -15 °C in Ref. [396] , -20 
°C in Refs. [ 395 , 397-400 ], -30 °C in Refs. [401-403] , and -40 °C in 
Refs. [404-409] . For these tests, the duration at subzero tempera- 
tures  must  be  suﬃcient  to  ensure  water  freezing.  Generally,  the 
upper  temperature  limit  is  the  normal  operating  temperature  of 
the fuel cell. For the fuel cell, the ice involved in freezing-thawing 
comes from residual water after shutdown or reaction product in 
the cold start process. The phase transition from water to ice is ac- 
companied by volume expansion, which together with frost-heave 
leads to local stress and component deformation in the fuel cell 
[ 402 , 406 , 410 , 411 ]. Thus, freezing-thawing cycles are characterized 
by cyclic expansion and contraction, which cause mechanical fa- 
tigue of the components. A summary of the mechanical degrada- 
tion suffered by fuel cells from freezing-thawing is presented in 
Fig. 37 . First, ice at the interfaces can separate the CL from the GDL 
and the membrane, thereby accelerating delamination, as Fig. 37 (a) 
and Fig. 37 (b) show. Delamination induced by freezing-thawing has 
been extensively observed [ 398 , 403-405 , 407-409 ], which causes a 
sharp increase in the contact resistance [ 398 , 405 ]. Second, ice in 
the GDL can destroy the pore structure by fracturing carbon ﬁbers, 
detaching  the  hydrophobic  PTFE  from  carbon  ﬁbers,  and  creat- 
ing defects in the PTFE. Defects in the PTFE induced by freezing- 
thawing are shown in Fig. 37 (c). Thus, loss of hydrophobicity adds 
to the diﬃculties in mass transfer and risks of water ﬂooding. Song 
et  al.  [399]  evaluated  the  effect  of  residual  water  status  on  mi- 
crostructural damage in the GDL after 20 freezing-thawing cycles, 
and found a strong correlation. More residual water means more 
ice in the freezing process, thereby causing more severe defects in 
the PTFE and a greater reduction in the water contact angle. The 
channel region of the GDL suffers worse damage due to the con- 
straint of the land [404] and the difference in ice distribution be- 
tween the land and channel regions [412] . Oszcipok et al. [413] ob- 
served  this  difference  after  repeated  cold  starts.  The  water  con- 
tact angle in the channel region of the GDL is only 112 °, whereas 
it  is  133 ° in  the  land  region.  Third,  the  membrane  morphology

to ice-induced overall fuel starvation, which accelerates carbon cor- 
rosion in the anode. It must be emphasized that starvation-induced 
degradation occurs by the same mechanism described in section 
4.2.2 , but differs in the cause of gas starvation. On the other hand,

changes, which is mainly ascribed to the ice at the CL-membrane 
interface [411] . Yan et al. [414] observed membrane surface rough- 
ness  and  pinholes after  cell  operation at  -15 °C  (see  Fig.  37 (d)). 
Using synchrotron radiation X-ray scan 3D image reconstruction, 
Zhong  et  al.  [403]  observed  micro-cracks  in  the  membrane  sur- 
face after 20 freezing-thawing cycles. Finally, freezing-thawing sig- 
niﬁcantly accelerates the generation and propagation of cracks in 
the CL [ 401 , 402 , 404 , 405 , 407-409 ]. Because water is prone to ac- 
cumulate  and  freeze  in  the  cracks,  a  CL  with  initial  cracks  suf- 
fers  more  serious  damage  [ 402 , 404 ].  Similar  to  the  case  of  GDL 
damage, a difference persists between the extent of damage in the 
channel and land regions of the CL, as shown in Fig. 37 (e). More- 
over, the difference is closely related to the bending stiffness of 
the GDL [ 59 , 402 , 405 ], which determines the uniformity of pressure 
distribution between the GDL and CL. A stiffer GDL mitigates de- 
formation and structural damage to the CL channel region by re- 
inforcing  the  constraint.  Lim  et  al.  [402]  examined  the  effect  of 
GDL materials on CL degradation. A carbon felt GDL, which pos- 
sesses a much higher bending stiffness, offers a signiﬁcant advan- 
tage over carbon cloth and carbon paper in relieving CL damage 
during freezing-thawing. As for the Pt catalyst in the CL, some re- 
searchers have reported a decay in the ECSA after freezing-thawing 

cycles  [ 393 , 394 , 399 , 401 , 403 ].  Fig.  37 (f)  illustrates  the  major  rea- 
son.  That  is,  ice  at  the  interface  detaches  the  ionomer  from  Pt 
particles [396] , thereby causing part of the Pt surface to become 
uncovered  and  inaccessible  to  protons.  This  ECSA  decay  is  irre- 
versible, because ionomer coverage is only partly recovered upon 
ice melting. Moreover, ionomer agglomeration is accelerated in the 
process.  As  discussed  above,  water  inside  the  fuel  cell  seriously 
damages component structures during freezing-thawing. Therefore, 
it  is  crucial  to  reduce  the  amount  of  residual  water  after  shut- 
down  and  mitigate  water  freezing  in  the  cold  start  process.  To 
achieve this, gas purging has been extensively shown to be effec- 
tive [ 394 , 395 , 397 , 399 , 401 ]. 

6. Summary 

Automotive  fuel  cells  can  suffer  serious  degradation  due  to 
complicated  and  severe  operating  conditions.  Different  operating 
conditions  accelerate  fuel  cell  aging  in  various  ways,  as  mani- 
fested in component aging, morphological changes, parameter de- 
cay,  and  ultimately  performance  degradation.  Understanding  the 
degradation  mechanisms  under  various  typical  conditions  is  of 
great signiﬁcance. This review paper focuses on three harsh oper-

ating conditions for automotive fuel cells: open-circuit/idling, dy- 
namic  load,  and  startup-shutdown.  Fuel  cell  polarization  is  ana- 
lyzed  in  section  2 ,  which  details  the  relationship  between  out- 
put performance and characteristic parameters. These characteris- 
tic parameters reﬂect the aging degree of components and their 
microstructure. The three conditions are reviewed comprehensively 
from the perspectives of AST methodology and degradation mech- 
anisms. In-situ and ex-situ AST methods of the three conditions 
are  reviewed  in  section  3.1 ,  section  4.1 ,  and  section  5.1 ,  respec- 
tively. Therein, research objectives and application conditions for 
different AST methods are elaborated. Reversible decay, especially 
during  open-circuit/idling,  is  prone  to  occur  in  steady-state  AST 
and leads to an over-estimate of fuel cell aging. Therefore, causes 
and recovery measures are described in section 3.1.2 . Degradation 
mechanisms  under  the  three  conditions  are  reviewed  in  section 
3.2 , section 4.2 , and section 5.2 , respectively. 

Fig. 38 and Fig. 39 summarize the principal mechanisms elab- 
orated in the text and present a complete image of aging in au- 
tomotive fuel cells. During open-circuit/idling, chemical degrada- 

tion of the membrane and Pt degradation are accelerated. Chemical 
degradation of the membrane is elaborated in section 3.2.1 , cover- 
ing the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide and free radical genera- 
tion ( section 3.2.1.1 ), the mechanism of free radical attack on the 
molecular  structure  of  the  PFSA  membrane  ( section  3.2.1.2 ),  and 
the acceleration of chemical degradation during open-circuit/idling 
( section  3.2.1.3 ).  Section  3.2.2  reviews  the  intensiﬁed  Pt  degra- 
dation under open-circuit/idling condition. In addition, Pt migra- 
tion and precipitation result in the formation of a Pt band in the 
membrane,  which  decreases  Pt  loading  in  the  cathode  and  af- 
fects  membrane  durability.  The  mechanism  of  Pt  precipitate  for- 
mation in the membrane is elaborated in section 3.2.3.1 . The ef- 
fect of the Pt band on membrane degradation is still debated. In 
section  3.2.3.2 ,  we  extract  three  key  factors  leading  to  the  con- 
troversy: the potential of the Pt band, the Pt crystal structure in 
the Pt band, and the distribution density of Pt crystals in the Pt 
band. Dynamic load condition ﬁrst leads to a dynamic water state, 
operating  temperature,  and  even  operating  pressure,  and  conse- 
quently, the mechanical degradation of components is accelerated

( section 4.2.1 ). Second, dynamic load increases the chance of gas 
starvation  owing  to  the  combined  effects  of  demand  dynamics, 
lagging gas supply, and internal differences in local reactant sup- 
ply.  The  local  and  overall  gas  starvation  are  reviewed  in  section 
4.2.2 .  Third,  potential  cycling  under  dynamic  load  condition  ac- 

celerates Pt particle growth and degradation of the ECSA, as re- 
viewed in section 4.2.3.1 . In this process, Pt dissolution and elec- 
trochemical Ostwald ripening play important roles. Ostwald ripen- 
ing of Pt catalysts and associated factors are elaborated in section 
4.2.3.2 . Furthermore, section 4.2.3.3 explains why Ostwald ripen-

ing is accelerated under potential cycling, which mainly focuses on 
accelerated Pt dissolution. Fuel cell aging during startup-shutdown 
originates from an air/hydrogen boundary in the anode, which in- 
creases the local cathode potential to approximately 1.5 V and in- 
duces severe carbon corrosion. The reverse current mechanism is 

elaborated in section 5.2.1 , involving its theoretical analysis and ex- 
perimental veriﬁcation. The pseudo-capacitive effect in the startup- 
shutdown process, initiated by Pt-related oxidation and reduction, 
is also discussed. The detailed consequences of microstructure fail- 
ure are summarized in section 5.2.2 . Impediments to mass trans-

fer  that  result  from  startup-shutdown  are  discussed  in  depth  in 
section 5.2.4 . Further, inﬂuencing factors and mitigation measures 
are summarized in section 5.3 . In addition, the durability problem 
related to cold start is treated separately in section 5.4 . The multi- 
aspects of mechanical degradation accelerated by freezing-thawing 
are elaborated. 

7. Conclusions and prospects 

The PEM fuel cell is suitable for automotive use because of its 
high eﬃciency and zero emissions, but commercialization is signif- 
icantly hampered by durability issues. Harsh operating conditions 
including open-circuit/idling, dynamic load, and startup-shutdown 
are key factors that accelerate the aging of automotive fuel cells. 
This paper reviews the impact of these operating conditions from 
the perspective of AST methods and degradation mechanisms. The 
principal conclusions and prospects are listed below: 

(a) In-situ  and  ex-situ  AST  methods  for  the  three  conditions  are 
designed with different research objectives and are suitable for 
different applications. For example, only current density cycling 
can induce a comprehensive aging state under actual dynamic 
load  condition,  whereas  ex-situ  humidity  cycling  and  poten- 
tial  cycling  accelerate  mechanical  degradation  and  Pt  catalyst 
degradation, respectively. Concerning startup-shutdown, repeti- 
tive startup-shutdown procedures most closely approach actual 
conditions and are always used to investigate mitigation strate- 
gies. Gas-exchange cycling is eﬃcient in provoking the degra- 
dation that reﬂects the actual state of the fuel cell interior. Car- 
bon corrosion during startup-shutdown can also be accelerated 
by  directly  controlling  the  cathode  potential.  It  must  be  em- 
phasized that reversible decay is prone to occur, especially in 
steady-state AST, primarily due to water accumulation, Pt oxi- 
dation, and Pt dissolution. Therefore, necessary recovery proce- 
dures are required in AST to avoid over-estimating performance 
decay. 

(b) Open-circuit/idling intensiﬁes the generation of hydrogen per- 
oxide in the anode due to stronger oxygen permeation. Thus, 
free radical generation is also enhanced, for which Fenton re- 
actions play an important role. Free radicals attack the molec- 
ular structure of the membrane at speciﬁc sites, causing chem- 
ical degradation of the membrane. Presently, it is still impor- 
tant  to  strengthen  the  molecular  structure  of  the  membrane 
and to avoid the introduction of certain sensitive groups, such 
as terminal carboxyl groups. In addition, the high cathode po- 
tential is also recognized as a key factor in accelerating mem- 
brane degradation, but studies of the mechanism are lacking. 
Existing  modeling work,  considering  the  iron  ion  redox  cycle 
and potential gradient in the ionomer, has demonstrated that 
a high cathode potential drives Fe 3 +  to the anode and subse- 
quently increases the Fe 2 +  concentration and accelerates Fen- 
ton reactions. However, further research is required, especially 
experimental validation. Limiting oxygen permeation and cath- 
ode potential is effective in relieving component degradation at 
lower loads, but methods to achieve this need to be developed. 
Cathodic gas recirculation seems to be effective, but validation 
by durability testing is required. During open-circuit/idling, the 
Pt catalyst also suffers from accelerated aging, which involves 
particle growth and Pt migration. Pt precipitation, in the form 
of a Pt band, is located at the abrupt change in mixed poten- 
tial within the membrane, which is determined by the partial 
pressure equilibrium of hydrogen and oxygen. There is a debate 
as to the effect of Pt precipitation on membrane degradation, 
particularly whether it enhances or suppresses the production 
2 and free radicals. To solve the controversy, three affect- 
of H 
ing factors have been presented and summarized: the potential 

2 O 

of the Pt band, the Pt crystal structure in the Pt band, and the 
distribution density of Pt crystals in the Pt band. Further studies 
are still required. Moreover, once the mechanism is suﬃciently 
understood, it may be possible to enhance membrane durabil- 
ity by means of Pt precipitation in the MEA. In addition, the 
identiﬁcation of radical scavengers suitable for use under fuel 
cell conditions, investigation of the mechanism, and evaluation 
of the impact and potential side-effects are three aspects that 
require further study. 

(c) Dynamic load creates dynamic thermal/humidity state, changes 
reactant demand, and induces potential cycling. These factors 
lead to mechanical degradation of components, gas starvation, 
and  Pt  particle  growth,  respectively.  Mechanical  degradation 
originates from the shrinking-swelling cycling of the ionomer 
upon changes in humidity, and manifests as ionomer redistri- 
bution,  electrode  cracks,  delamination,  and  membrane  cracks 
and  holes.  Moreover,  mechanical  degradation  is  non-uniform 
due to differences in the local current density and water con- 
tent. Air starvation induces hydrogen pumping, thereby causing 
hot spots in the cathode. Local and overall fuel starvation de- 
pend  on  the  degree  of  starvation,  leading  to  current  reversal 
and cell reversal, and subsequent carbon corrosion in the cath- 
ode and anode, respectively. Further studies on control of the 
gas supply, load-up procedures, and ﬂow ﬁeld design and opti- 
mization may help avoid gas starvation. Potential cycling signif- 
icantly accelerates Pt dissolution by means of a place-exchange 
mechanism  at  the  particle  surface,  and  subsequent  Pt  migra- 
tion and electrochemical Ostwald ripening. Electrochemical Ost- 
wald ripening governs Pt particle growth during potential cy- 
cling, which is affected by particle size and distribution, con- 
ductivity of the catalyst support, and ionic conductivity of the 
ionomer. A highly uniform particle size distribution (that is, a 
narrow size distribution) suppresses Ostwald ripening. This is a 
valuable approach to minimize particle growth but requires ad- 
vances in the production of Pt nanoparticles and catalyst coated 
membranes. Modeling work on Pt particle growth in fuel cells 
is also valuable for estimation of catalyst aging and analysis of 
aging characteristics. In addition, identifying a cathode catalyst 
possessing high catalytic activity and tolerance to dynamic po- 
tentials is an important research subject. 

(d) Fuel cells suffer from severe carbon corrosion under the con- 
dition of startup-shutdown, which results in Pt agglomeration, 
Pt detachment, structural collapse of the cathode, and impeded 
mass transfer in the cathode. According to the reverse current 
mechanism, an air/hydrogen boundary in the anode gives rise 
to a very high potential of approximately 1.5 V in the local cath- 
ode. The high potential induces severe carbon corrosion, which 
is manifested by CO 
2  emission, reduction of the carbon parti- 
cle size, holes in the carbon support, and shrink of the cathode 
thickness. Due to differences in the local gas atmosphere and 
local mass transfer, there are signiﬁcant differences in carbon 
corrosion between the anode inlet and outlet and between the 
channel and land regions. Thus, it may be beneﬁcial to reinforce 
the MEA, speciﬁcally in the local area of the cathode, and to 
conduct a collaborative design of the ﬂow ﬁeld and MEA. Mass 
transfer  diﬃculties  arise  during  startup-shutdown  because  of 
ionomer redistribution, a porosity decrease induced by struc- 
tural  collapse  of  the  cathode,  and  surface  hydrophilization of 
the  carbon  support.  Mitigation  measures  to  reduce  or  elimi- 
nate the effect of the air/hydrogen boundary have been widely 
studied,  but  need  optimization.  Comparisons  between  differ- 
ent measures are still absent. Furthermore, suitable corrosion- 
resistant catalyst support materials are in great demand. Fre- 
quent cold starts and shutdowns at subzero temperatures gen- 
erate freezing-thawing cycles. In the freezing process, volume 
expansion  together  with  frost-heave  causes  severe  structural 

36

damage to almost all components. Thus, it is necessary to re- 
move residual water from the fuel cell after shutdown. Investi- 
gation of cold start strategies, together with the water-ice state 
and distribution in the process, is crucial. 

(e) Automotive fuel cell stacks are, generally, large, containing hun- 
dreds of fuel cells and having a large active area. Consistency 
between fuel cells and uniformity within a single fuel cell may 
inﬂuence  the  aging  process.  There  is  an  increasing  need  in 
large-scale fuel cell stacks to combine durability analysis with 
the mass transfer process and internal heat and water states 
under different conditions. Both experimental studies and mod- 
eling work are needed to reveal further details of fuel cell ag- 
ing in stack conﬁguration and to improve the design of long- 
lifespan fuel cell stacks.
