Infrared laser-absorption spectroscopy (IR-LAS) sensors play an important role in diagnosing and characterizing a
wide range of combustion systems. Of all the laser-diagnostic techniques, LAS is arguably the most versatile and
quantitative, as it has been used extensively to provide quantitative, species-specific measurements of gas tem-
perature, pressure, composition and velocity in both laboratory- and industrial-scale systems. Historically, most
IR-LAS work has been conducted using tunable diode lasers; however, today’s researchers have access to a wide
range of light sources that provide unique sensing capabilities and convenient access to nearly the entire IR spec-
trum ((cid:1) 0.8 to 16 mm). In particular, the advent of room-temperature wavelength-tunable mid-infrared semicon-
ductor lasers (e.g., interband- and quantum-cascade lasers) and hyperspectral light sources (e.g., MEMS VCSELs,
Fourier-domain mode-locked lasers, dispersed supercontinuum, and frequency combs) has provided a number of
unique capabilities that combustion researchers have exploited. The primary goals of this review paper are: (1) to
document the recent development, application, and current capabilities of IR-LAS sensors for laboratory- and
industrial-scale combustors and propulsion systems, (2) to elucidate the design and use of IR-LAS sensors for
combustion gases through a discussion of the modern sensor-design process and state-of-the-art techniques, and
(3) to highlight some of the remaining measurement opportunities, challenges, and needs. A thorough review
and description of the fundamental spectroscopy governing the accuracy of such sensors, and recent findings and
databases that enable improved modeling of molecular absorption spectra will also be provided.

1. Introduction

1.1. Role of IR-LAS in combustion

POver the last 40C years, a wide range of laser diagnostics have
been developed and deployed for characterizing combustion via
measurements of gas temperature, pressure, velocity, and composi-
tion. The development and application of these measurement meth-
ods has been highlighted in diagnostics colloquia during the past
twenty bienniel International Combustion Symposia (published in
the Proceedings of the Combustion Institute), as well as in several
excellent review articles and text books. For example, applications
of laser diagnostics have been an important part of two Hottel
papers at the International Combustion Symposium (1998 by Wolf-
rum [1] and 2010 by Hanson [2]) as well as numerous other reviews
such as those by Allen [3], Werle [4], Lackner [5], and Schulz et al.
[6], and most recently, Bolshov et al. [7]. Several books have also
been devoted to this subject. For example, Eckbreth [8] describes the

Pearly history and the basic fundamental science of laser-diagnostic
techniques, Kohse and Jeffries [9] provide a review of practical appli-
cations, and most recently, Hanson, Spearrin, and Goldenstein [10]
provide a thorough description of the fundamental spectroscopy
and physics needed by researchers and students to apply laser-based
diagnostics to their work. This review will focus on documenting the
status of infrared laser-absorption spectroscopy (IR-LAS) sensors,
and the role they play in studying combustion science and character-
izing combustion-based systems.

PThere are a wide variety of optical and non-optical diagnostics
techniques that complement and compete with IR-LAS sensors used
for combustion applications. The full arsenal of optical diagnostics
(i.e., absorption, emission, laser-induced fluorescence, Raman, and
laser-induced incandescence), as well as non-optical diagnostics
(pressure transducers, thermocouples, gas chromatography and
mass spectroscopy) are all quite useful for studying combustion. The
primary advantage of IR-LAS is its ability to provide high-bandwidth,
species-specific, in situ measurements of thermodynamic conditions
(e.g., temperature, pressure) and a wide range of molecular species.
Further, while the spatial resolution of IR-LAS is typically limited by
its path-integrated nature, it is one of the most quantitative and
broadly applicable laser-diagnostic techniques. Its comparatively
simple signal interpretation enables quantitative measurements and
it can be applied to virtually all temperatures and pressures. How-
ever, for many combustion applications, capturing the spatially-
resolved structures in the flow field is needed, and planar laser-
induced fluorescence (PLIF) and other pulsed imaging diagnostics
are naturally preferred. Similarly, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scat-
tering remains the preferred technique for providing point measure-
ments of temperature and species.

PFrom a practical standpoint, the costs of diode, quantum-cascade,
and interband-cascade lasers that are now used routinely in IR-LAS
are much less than that of the systems needed for laser-based imag-
ing diagnostics. Similarly the acquisition and operational costs of
laser detectors are much less than the cameras needed for imaging.
The lasers used for IR-LAS are also smaller, more robust, and con-
sume less power compared to current laser-based imaging systems.
At the same time, the researcher developing sensors for combustion
control and monitoring should not lose sight of the even lower oper-
ation and maintenance costs of thermocouples, pressure sensors, or
optical emission detectors. A goal of this manuscript is to highlight
the current state-of-the-art in applying IR-LAS to combustion sys-
tems in order to help the reader chose the most appropriate diagnos-
tic suite for an application. First, we will review some of the early
milestones that have shaped the development of IR-LAS.

1.2. History of IR-LAS

PSoon after the laser was invented, Sulzmann [12] recognized the
value of laser-absorption measurements of specific species in com-
bustion gases, and the first applications using tunable diode lasers
(TDLs) soon followed. In the late 1970s, TDLs and infrared detectors
required cryogenic cooling and dispersive optics were required to
select a single mode from the multi-mode laser output. To our
knowledge, the first application of TDLs for spectrally resolved
direct-absorption sensing in flames was reported by Hanson in 1977
[13]. These methods were quickly extended to shock-heated gases
[14] and two-color thermometry in flame gases [15]. Not long after,
frequency- and wavelength-modulation spectroscopy (FMS and
WMS) were developed to increase the sensitivity of TDL absorption
measurements [16(cid:3)23].

PIronically, the first IR-LAS measurements were conducted in the
mid-infrared (mid-IR), although the associated hardware limitations
at the time severely complicated or precluded measurements out-
side of the laboratory. This began to change in the mid 1980s, when
the telecommunication industry began producing large numbers of

PAlGaAs and InGaAsP diode lasers that could be operated at room
temperature. In 1988, Cassidy leveraged these advancements and
used a fiber-coupled room-temperature TDL near 1.3 mm for trace-
gas sensing via WMS [24]. In 1991, room temperature TDLs were
first applied to gasdynamic applications via the development of the
first diode-laser-based mass flux sensor based on spectrally resolved
O2 absorption [25], a technique which would be used in flight nearly
30 years later [26(cid:3)28]. In 1993 Arroyo and Hanson [29] became the
first to use telecommunication-grade TDLs near 1.4 mm for two-
color thermometry and H2O sensing in flames. Subsequent advance-
ments leveraging telecommunication technology led to wavelength-
multiplexed and fiber-coupled sensors for multi-parameter sensing
[30,31], and the first TDLAS sensor for closed-loop combustor control
[32]. Even though the TDL industry was in its infancy, there were
many early applications to combusting flows and the reader is
referred to several excellent reviews by Allen [3], Werle [4], and
Wolfrum [1].

PResearch in the 2000s focused on improving the robustness of
LAS sensors for field measurements via increased spectral informa-
tion and use of improved WMS techniques, and these trends con-
tinue today. The enhanced wavelength tuning capabilities of VCSELs
were exploited for the first high-pressure measurements of O2 [33],
as well as cesium spectra for temperature, pressure, and velocity
measurements in detonation flows at high rates [34,35]. Soon after,
Fourier-domain mode-locked (FDML) lasers were used to acquired
even greater spectral information of H2O near 1.4 mm for thermome-
try and H2O sensing in a variety of combustion flows [36(cid:3)38].
Around the same time, TDL-based sensors for combustion and pro-
pulsion applications shifted towards WMS owing to the develop-
ment of improved, calibration-free WMS models [39(cid:3)41] suitable
for large modulation depths and the higher-order intensity modula-
tion accompanying it, as well as 1f-normalization. These methods
were first applied to TDLAS sensors for temperature and H2O sensing
in an IC-engine [42] and a model-scramjet combustor [43].

PToday researchers developing IR-LAS techniques and sensors
have never had more design freedom. Nearly any wavelength in the
IR can be accessed by single-mode, room-temperature lasers
enabling sensitive monitoring of most molecular species of interest
to combustion. Fig. 1 shows the intensity of various IR absorption
transitions for a few combustion species at 300 and 1500 K. Unre-
stricted access to the IR spectrum has provided unprecedented
opportunities for the development of LAS sensors that are tailored
for unique conditions to optimize signal strength and temperature
sensitivity, and minimize interfering absorption. These compact,
solid-state laser sources include diode lasers (TDLs, visible to
(cid:1)3 mm), interband cascade lasers (ICLs, 3 to (cid:1)6 mm), and quantum
cascade lasers (QCLs, 4 to 20 mm), all of which provide sufficient
power to be sensitively monitored by compact room temperature or
thermoelectric-cooled detectors.
In addition, a wide variety of
hyperspectral sources continue to be developed, including MEMS
VCSELs, FDML, dispersed supercontinuum, frequency combs, and
external-cavity TDLs and QCLs. With these tools, there are few mole-
cules that cannot be measured, which has taken us to an exciting
time focused not only on the fundamental development of new LAS
techniques, but on the transitioning of new LAS sensors into the
field.

Pstate-of-the-art techniques, and (4) to highlight some of the remain-
ing measurement opportunities, challenges, and needs facing
researchers today. We begin this paper by reviewing the basic fun-
damentals of IR-LAS and follow with a comprehensive discussion of
the various absorption-spectroscopy models and databases available
to researchers today. Next, we discuss three of the most widely used
IR-LAS techniques: direct absorption (DA), wavelength-modulation
spectroscopy (WMS), and cavity-enhanced absorption spectros-
copy (CEAS), where we consider fixed- and scanned-wavelength
variants of these methods. We then discuss the optical hardware
(i.e., lasers, fibers, IR materials etc.) available today, and the role
they play in various IR-LAS techniques. Next, we provide a high-
level discussion of the sensor-design process before we go on to
review and highlight some of the most impressive examples of
IR-LAS applied to studies of combustion science and combustion-
based systems; sensors for: flames, shock tubes, power plants,
gasifiers, gas turbines,
internal combustion engines, scramjets,
and detonation combustors will all be discussed. Our review is
primarily limited to work done in the last 15 years (to avoid
repeating the excellent, earlier reviews), with particular empha-
sis on the last 5 years. Further, our focus is on in situ IR-LAS
sensing due to its non-intrusive nature and greater time resolu-
tion (compared to sampling-based methods). Lastly, we conclude
with a brief discussion of key takeaways, and the remaining
opportunities, challenges, and needs in IR-LAS research that are
pertinent to combustion studies.

2. Fundamentals

PThe fundamentals of LAS are described to establish the conven-
tions and units used throughout this manuscript and facilitate the
discussion of more complex theory and diagnostic techniques that
follow.

PAtoms and molecules with a dipole moment can absorb and emit
radiation. In the infrared, absorption and emission can occur when
the photon energy is equal to (i.e., resonant with) to the spacing
between two discrete ro-vibrational states and the amount of
absorbed or emitted radiation is proportional to the number density
in the absorbing or emitting states, respectively. This leads to dis-
crete absorption or emission transitions within a given vibrational
band (a group of transitions corresponding to a specific change in
vibrational energy) and each individual transition within that band
corresponds to a unique change in rotational energy. In reality, these
discrete transitions are broadened by several mechanisms and a line-
shape model is required to describe the distribution (in energy/
wavelength/frequency space) over which a given transition absorbs
or emits light. These concepts are illustrated in Fig. 2.

PFor a monochromatic light source, the light intensity transmitted
through a uniform, absorbing gas is given by Beer’s Law in the

X

Pfollowing form:
It D Ioexpð¡knLÞ

ð1Þ

where Io and It are the incident and transmitted light intensities, kn
[cm¡1] is the spectral absorption coefficient per unit length at optical
frequency n [cm¡1], and L [cm] is the path length through the
absorbing gas. This formulation is valid for all cases where kn is con-
stant along the measurement path (e.g., uniform gas properties and
negligible absorption-induced population transfer). In this case, the
absorbance (a D knL) can be related to gas properties using

ðn; T; P; xÞL

j

where S(T) [cm¡2-atm¡1]is the linestrength as a function of tempera-
ture T [K], P [atm] is the gas pressure, f [cm] is the lineshape func-
tion, and j denotes a specific absorption transition. In combustion
gases, the lineshape function is usually modeled by the Voigt Profile
(VP) owing to it accounting for both Doppler and collisional broad-
ening. However, in certain cases (discussed in Section 3) the VP
can lead to substantial errors, thereby motivating the use of more
advanced lineshape models.

PTypically f is defined according to Eq. (3) such that the integrated
absorbance, A, is given by Eq. (4). When individual transitions can be
resolved, the integrated absorbance can be measured and used to
calculate gas properties, thereby avoiding the need for a priori
knowledge of line broadening.

PThe measured integrated absorbance of a transition can be used
to calculate the mole fraction of the absorbing species (with temper-
ature, pressure, and path length known) and the gas temperature
can be calculated directly from a measured two-color ratio of inte-
grated areas using Eq. (6) [10].

parameters and is independent of pressure, mole fraction, and

PIn addition, the velocity of a gaseous flow along a line-of-sight
can be determined by measuring the Doppler-shifted absorption.
For a single line-of-sight angled relative to the flow direction, the
velocity of the gas, U, can be calculated using Eq. (7):

where u is the angle of the line-of-sight relative to the flow direction
and Dn is the measured Doppler-shift of the transition. In practice,
this is typically done using two laser beams, e.g., angled at 45° and
135° relative to the flow (i.e., one directed upstream and one down-
stream), to enable use of the differential Doppler-shift (DnDiff). In
this case, the flow velocity can be calculated using Eq. (8).

ðn; T; P; xÞL
Here n [molecules-cm¡3] is the number density of the gas and s
[cm2-molecule¡1] is the absorption cross section of the absorbing
species. The key difference between Eq. (2) and (9) is that Eq. (2) cal-
culates the spectral absorbance by modeling the contribution of
each individual absorption transition whereas Eq. (9) avoids this
complexity via use of an absorption cross section which quantifies
how much light a molecule absorbs at a given wavelength and ther-
modynamic conditions. While the latter approach is less complex, it
relies on a lookup table (typically obtained from experiments) that
cannot be extrapolated beyond the thermodynamic conditions for
which the cross sections were obtained. In comparison, the former
approach can be used to calculate the absorbance at an arbitrary
thermodynamic condition as long as the fundamental spectroscopic
parameters for the active transitions (e.g., linestrength, collisional-
broadening coefficients) are available. Fig. 2 shows simulated absor-
bance spectra of the fundamental vibration band of CO (a) and the
C-H stretch of heptane (b). The discrete absorbance spectrum of CO’s
fundamental vibration band was calculated using Eq. (2) and line-
by-line parameters [11]. The absorbance spectrum of heptane’s C-H
stretch absorption band was calculated using Eq. (9) and the absorp-
tion cross section measured by Klingbeil et al. [44].

PAccurate IR-LAS measurements of gas properties (temperature,
pressure, composition, velocity) require an accurate spectroscopic
model to convert the measured spectrum to the gas properties of
interest. The absorption spectra of combustion gases are frequently
challenging to model given that multi-component gases at high-
temperatures and -pressures are frequently of interest. Elevated
temperatures and pressures complicate the spectrum via the activa-
tion of high-E” transitions and increased collision broadening,
respectively, and multi-component gases complicate the calculation
of lineshapes via species-specific collision broadening. Further, the
large range of thermodynamic conditions, and the often extreme
temperatures and pressures of interest, often preclude the use of
empirically derived absorption cross-section data. As a result, line-
by-line simulations are often the most suitable method for modeling
absorption spectra.

PLine-by-line simulations of absorption spectra require (1) a spec-
troscopic model and (2) spectroscopic parameters that describe how
the line positions, strengths, and shapes depend on gas properties.
Since the determination of linestrengths is relatively straightforward
and most LAS techniques do not require precise knowledge of abso-
lute line positions, this section will focus on discussing lineshape-
physics and -models that are most appropriate for combustion gases
due to their greater complexity. Our discussion will focus on models
that are applicable to cases where the assumption of isolated lines
(i.e., no line mixing) and the impact approximation are valid; how-
ever, both of these complexities will be discussed. This section will
then conclude with a discussion on the status and availability of var-
ious spectroscopic databases with particular attention to those that
are most relevant to gases at elevated temperatures and pressures.

3.1. Lineshape physics and models

PIn the vast majority of combustion applications, researchers have
used the Voigt profile to model absorption lineshapes owing to its
relative simplicity and, typically, high accuracy, yielding residuals
within 2% of measured lineshapes at number densities near STP
(standard temperature and pressure). However, many researchers
have shown that the Voigt profile can lead to gull-wing shaped
residuals (between measured and model spectra, shown later in
Fig. 4a) on the order of 1(cid:3)10% of the peak absorbance at low to mod-
erate number densities (i.e., when collisional narrowing or speed-
dependent broadening can be significant). Furthermore, it is also
well known that the Voigt and Lorentzian profiles breakdown at
high number densities due line mixing and a breakdown of the
impact approximation.

PThis section will discuss the underlying collision physics respon-
sible for these complexities, the lineshape models that address
them, and will point the reader to the relevant literature. Particular
attention will be paid to H2O and CO2, however, more generally
these molecules can be thought of as ambassadors for other mole-
cules with large or small rotational-energy-level spacing, respec-
tively. Table 1 introduces a few of these processes and points out the
somewhat fortuitous nature of how molecules with large rotational-
energy level spacing are prone to only Dicke narrowing and speed-
dependent broadening complications, whereas molecules with small
rotational-energy-level spacing are prone to only line mixing and
the breakdown of the impact approximation. Table 2 illustrates the
parameters needed by each lineshape model discussed in this
section.

P3.1.1. Doppler broadening and the gaussian profile

state have a velocity component in the same (or opposite) direction
of the photon propagation. The absorbing molecules then see a

Since the absorbers are distributed across a range of velocities (i.e.,
they may belong to different velocity classes), Doppler broadening is
said to be heterogeneous. In the absence of other broadening mecha-
nisms, the absorption lineshape of gases following a Maxwellian
velocity-distribution function (VDF) is given by the Gaussian profile,

transitions, light-weight absorbers, and high temperatures.

P3.1.2. Collisional broadening

PCollisional broadening of a rovibrational absorption transition
occurs when: (1) inelastic collisions reduce a molecule’s lifetime in
the absorbing state, (2) elastic dephasing collisions perturb the
molecular rotation and/or vibration, or (3) elastic angular-momen-
tum altering collisions re-orient the angular momentum vector of
the dipole [45]. Collisional broadening is typically modeled as homo-
geneous, meaning the broadening process is independent of the
absorber’s speed. In this case, collisional broadening is accurately
described by a Lorentzian profile, fL, and an ensemble-averaged
collisional FWHM, Dnc, given by Eq. (12) and (13), respectively.

Here ng is the collisional-broadening temperature exponent.
It
should be noted that the accuracy of Eq. (14) can break down over a
large temperature range, particularly when the parameters are used
beyond the temperature domain for which they were obtained. In
our experience, usually a single value of ng is sufficient for tempera-
tures from 300 to 1200 K, however, for greater accuracy we recom-
mend using multiple values of ng, one for temperatures from 300 to
900 K and another for temperatures greater than 900 K, however,
these are not steadfast rules.

P3.1.3. Combined Doppler- and collisional-broadening and the Voigt
profile

PThe Voigt profile (VP) is given by a convolution of the Gaussian
and Lorentzian profiles and, therefore, accounts for both Doppler
and collisional broadening. To date, the Voigt profile remains the
lineshape of choice for most spectroscopic databases (e.g., HITRAN
[11] and HITEMP [47]) owing to its wide applicability and balance
between simplicity and accuracy. In practice, the Voigt profile is typ-
ically calculated using numerical approximations due to the compu-
tational cost of evaluating it directly. For example, algorithms
developed by Humlicek [48] (later enhanced by Kuntz [49] and cor-
rected by Ruyten [50]) and that of McClean et al. [51] are some of
the most widely used approximations. The Voigt profile reduces to
the Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles when DnD or Dnc equal 0,
respectively. However, numerical approximations can breakdown in
these limits, therefore the user should be cautious.

PTo illustrate the lineshape profiles discussed thus far, Fig. 3 shows
Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt Profiles with DnD D DncD0.04 cm¡1
(i.e., representative values of near-IR H2O transitions dilute in air at
1 atm and 1000 K). Despite having equal FWHM, the Gaussian profile
exhibits a considerably larger peak absorbance compared to the Lor-
entzian profile, thereby highlighting the non-equal nature of these
broadening mechanisms. Furthermore, the FHWM of the Voigt pro-
file is 0.066 cm¡1 (i.e., representative of the convolution of Gaussian
and Lorentzian distributions and, thus, is not equal to the sum of
Doppler and collisional FWHM).

P3.1.4. Dicke narrowing and the Rautian and Galatry profiles

PAt number densities near STP, Dicke narrowing may lead to a nar-
rowed lineshape, typically observed as gull-wing residuals between
a measured spectrum and its best-fit Voigt lineshape (see Fig. 4a).
Dicke narrowing [52] refers to a collision-induced reduction of the
Doppler width (compared to that predicted by Eq. (11)) that occurs
when collisions confine the translational motion of the absorbers.
It is most noticeable for high-J transitions of molecules with large

light the importance of using more advanced lineshape models for high-J H2O transitions influenced by line-narrowing processes. Figures adapted from [46].

Protational-energy-level spacing (e.g., H2O, HCl, HF), since collisional-
broadening of such transitions is relatively weak. Further, it is usu-
ally more pronounced at number densities where the mean free
path is comparable to the wavelength divided by 2p, and when
the mass of the collision partner is much greater than that of the
absorber.

PThe Rautian [53] (RP) and Galatry [54] (GP) profiles address Dicke
narrowing using hard- and soft-collision models, respectively, via a
parameter, z, that is related to the frequency of velocity-changing
collisions, b, according to:

Similar to the collisional-broadening coefficient, the temperature
dependence of bk is typically modeled using the power law. When
b D 0; the Rautian and Galatry profiles both reduce to the Voigt
profile.

P3.1.5. Speed-dependent collisional broadening and the speed-
dependent Voigt profile

PLike Dicke narrowing, speed-dependent collisional broadening
tends to narrow the absorption lineshape leading to gull-wing
shaped residuals (when compared to the Voigt profile, see Fig. 4a)

Pand is also most noticeable for high-J transitions of molecules with
large rotational-energy-level spacing at number densities near STP.
Speed-dependent collisional broadening (i.e., heterogenous or non-
Lorentzian collisional broadening) refers to cases where the effi-
ciency of collisional broadening depends on the absorber’s speed.
Rigorously speaking, this is likely always the case since the absorb-
er’s speed alters the amount of kinetic energy available for promot-
ing rotationally inelastic collisions and altering the trajectory of
collisions; however, ignoring this complexity is surprisingly accurate
in the majority of cases relevant to combustion.

PSeveral lineshape models have been developed to address speed-
dependent broadening (see [55] and the references therein), among
the most popular is the quadratic-speed-dependent Voigt profile
(qSDVP) [56(cid:3)58] which addresses speed-dependent collisional broad-
ening via a speed-dependent collisional-broadening coefficient, g k,2,
and corresponding collisional FWHM, Dnc,2. In the event that Dnc;2 D
D 0 (i.e., the speed dependence of broadening is negligible), the
gk;2
speed-dependent Voigt profile reduces to the standard Voigt profile.
Currently, very little temperature-dependent experimental data exists
for, g k,2, however the power-law model has been suggested [55] and
demonstrated [46] (see Fig. 5) as a suitable model for the temperature-
dependence of g k,2, albeit over only a moderate temperature range.

P3.1.6. Partially correlated quadratic-speed-dependent hard collision
profile (pCqSDHC)

lated transitions, the IUPAC has recommended that the pCqSDHC

Peven remotely hostile combustion applications are not suitable for
use with the pCqSDHC; however, the pCqSDHC will enable the devel-
opment of improved databases and models (e.g., through controlled
laboratory measurements) that will improve our ability to model
absorption spectra in combustion gases at pressures of interest.

Pprofile be used in future databases [59]. This lineshape model [55]
accounts for Doppler broadening, speed-dependent collision broaden-
ing (via a quadratic speed-dependence model) and pressure shifting,
Dicke narrowing (via a hard collision model), and recognizes that
velocity- and state-changing collisions are correlated. As such, 7
parameters are required to simulate the pCqSDHC; however,
it
reduces to simpler lineshape models (e.g., speed-dependent Voigt,
Voigt, Lorentzian etc.) when specific parameters are set to zero. While
this model has been shown to provide extreme accuracy (lineshape
residuals near 0.01% of the peak absorbance [60]), the large number
of free parameters and, correlation between several of them, currently
mandates the use of multi-spectrum fitting (over a range of pres-
sures) to high-fidelity data (SNR >>1000) in order to obtain reliable
lineshape parameters. That said, most absorption data acquired in

PAt high number densities, the impact approximation can break-
down leading to elevated absorption in the transition wings (com-
pared to that predicted by Lorentzian-based lineshape models, see
Fig. 6). The impact approximation assumes that collisions are instan-
taneous. Hartmann et al. [61] suggests that the impact approxima-

PSeveral researchers have developed and investigated methods for
addressing the breakdown of the impact approximation. The most
widely used is the CKD model developed by Clough et al. [62] which
uses an empirical frequency-dependent correction factor, known as
the x-Function, to correct the Lorentzian (or Voigt) lineshape

gested C is temperature dependent [61], and Rieker et al. [63]
showed that C D 2.5 was more accurate for H2O spectra near
7204 cm¡1 at 700 K. It should be noted that the CKD model is not
normalized to an area of 1 and, therefore, Eq. (3) is not applicable.

P3.1.8. Line mixing

PAt high number densities, line mixing may also need to be
accounted for to accurately model infrared absorption spectra. Line
mixing (i.e., collisional coupling or collisional interference and not to be
confused with line blending or overlapping) occurs when inelastic col-
lisions transfer molecules between the two upper states and two
lower-states of two absorption transitions. This process transfers
absorption intensity (i.e., population) from the far wings of each
transition into the region between transitions. In other words, colli-
sions transfer absorbers from weakly absorbing regions to strongly
absorbing regions leading to a narrowing of spectral structure [64]
(see Fig. 7). The absorption spectrum can no longer be described as
the sum of that of individual transitions using Eq. (2), and models
that account for this process are needed. Unlike Dicke narrowing
and speed-dependent broadening, line mixing is most pronounced
when the spacing between rotational-energy-levels is small such
that molecules can easily be shuffled between levels. As a result, line
mixing is much more problematic for CO2 and CO compared to H2O.
For example, Farooq et al. [65] showed significant line mixing effects
at only 10 amagat for CO2 transitions near 2.7 mm; while Nagali [66]
suggests that line mixing for H2O is not significant below 50 amagat
using relations put forth by Hartmann et al. [61].

P3.1.9. Results and discussion

PNumerous researchers [46,58,68(cid:3)76] have shown that using
lineshape models that account for Dicke narrowing and/or speed-
dependent collisional broadening at number densities comparable
to STP can reduce mildly inaccurate lineshape residuals (i.e., 1(cid:3)5%
error) of the Voigt profile by (cid:1) 1 order of magnitude, typically lead-
ing to residuals below 0.1% of the peak absorbance. While these
modest gains in accuracy may seem insignificant from the stand-
point of practical sensing in combustion, using such lineshape mod-
els (when appropriate) to develop an empirically derived collisional-
broadening database can translate into large gains in accuracy at
higher pressures. For example, the recent study by Goldenstein et al.

P[76] showed that simulations performed using N2-broadening coeffi-
cients derived from least-squares fitting the Voigt profile to H2O
spectra at low pressures (i.e., 0.1 to 1 atm) overpredicted the peak
absorbance of several high-J H2O lines in N2 by (cid:1) 30% at 15 atm and
1500 K. In comparison, simulations performed using N2-broadening
coefficients derived from Galatry-profile fits to low-pressure spectra
matched the measured spectra at 15 atm within 5% of the peak
absorbance. This being said, it is particularly important to use more
sophisticated lineshape profiles when the best-fit parameters will
be used to simulate spectra at temperatures and pressures outside
the domain from which they were obtained.

PFig. 4a shows simulated lineshapes of the H2O transition near
7471.6 cm¡1 using empirically derived lineshape parameters for
Voigt, Rautian, Galatry, and speed-dependent Voigt profiles. The
more advanced lineshape profiles exhibit a strikingly similar shape
which leads to controversy regarding the underlying physics that is
primarily responsible for the gull-wing residuals of the Voigt profile
(Dicke narrowing or speed-dependent broadening). However, a
growing body of literature (see [46] and the references therein)
showing transition-specific Dicke narrowing parameters suggests
that speed-dependent broadening may be the primary mechanism,
since Dicke narrowing is a species-specific process and should not
be transition-specific [75]. The recent study by Goldenstein and Han-
son [46] shows that the speed-dependent Voigt profile yields similar
improvements at high temperatures, however, with best-fit line-
shape parameters that exhibit a much more physical behavior than
those of the Rautian and Galatry profiles, further supporting this the-
ory that the speed-dependent Voigt profile is a more physical model.
Regardless, further studies over a broad range of temperatures
and pressures are needed to confirm this theory, and if possible,
lineshape models that account for both Dicke narrowing and
speed-dependent broadening (e.g., the pCqSDHC [55,59]) need to
be studied.

PSeveral researchers have studied the influence of the impact
approximation and line mixing on IR-absorption spectra of H2O
[61,63,66,77] and CO2 [65,67,78(cid:3)80], and some studies have been
conducted at high temperatures [61,63,66,67,77,78,80]. Regarding
H2O, Nagali and Hanson [77] acquired TDLAS measurements of H2O
absorption spectra near 7117 cm¡1 in an N2 bath at number densi-
ties up to 18 amagat. The authors found that simulations performed
with the Voigt profile and additive approximation agreed with mea-
sured spectra (within an uncertainty of (cid:1) 5%) in a 2 cm¡1 region
around the transition linecenter. Later these authors investigated
the transition near 7185 cm¡1 at similar conditions, and found that
if the x-Function was used to model the wings of a strong neighbor-
ing transition, simulations performed with the Voigt profile
agreed with measurements. As a result, the authors concluded
that line mixing was not significant (for the H2O transitions stud-
ied) at up to 18 amagat. Furthermore, Nagali [66] later estimated
that line mixing is not significant for H2O below 50 amagat using
the relations put forth by Hartmann [61] who states that the
spacing between strongly coupled H2O transitions in the P and
R-branch is typically 10 cm¡1. However, experimental results
for a wide range of transitions remain needed to validate this
prediction.

PIn comparison to H2O, line mixing is much more significant
for CO2. Farooq et al. [65] acquired FTIR measurements of the n1
C n3 CO2 band near 2.7 mm at room temperature and up to
30 bar, and showed that a spectroscopic model developed by
Niro et al. [81] (which accounts for line mixing) significantly
improved the accuracy of the modeled spectra in the band cen-
ter and wings compared to that calculated using the Lorentzian
and x-Function. More recently, Christiansen et al. [67] acquired
FTIR measurements of CO2 absorption near 2, 2.7 and 4.2 mm at
high-temperatures and -pressures (see Fig. 7). Measured spectra
of the n3 fundamental band at 100 bar and 1000 K are reported,

Pand simulations with the Voigt profile and HITRAN2012 data-
base [11] were shown to significantly overpredict the absorp-
tion in the band wings, perhaps due to line-mixing effects. In
addition, Christiansen et al. [67] show similar results for the CO
fundamental vibration band at 40.5 bar and 296 K. Several
authors have developed empirical corrections to improve the
modeling of high-pressure CO2 absorption spectra beyond that
of the Voigt profile [78,82(cid:3)85]. However, significant experimen-
tal research remains needed to evaluate the accuracy of these
models.

3.2. Databases

P3.2.1. Line-by-line data

PFor relatively small combustion species, with approximately 8
atoms or less, spectroscopic parameters in the infrared are mostly
catalogued on a line-by-line basis by a few well-established data-
bases, namely HITRAN/HITEMP [11,47], GEISA [87], and CDSD [88],
with the latter database for carbon dioxide only. These databases are
updated every few years and combine data collected from numerous
laboratories with theoretical models to compile parameters for colli-
sional broadening, intensity/linestrength, and pressure shift used,
amongst other purposes, for predictive modeling of absorption spec-
tra as described in the previous section. Pressure broadening and
shift parameters are generally limited to collisions with nitrogen,
air, or the absorbing species (i.e., self). The line-by-line databases
cover most products and intermediates of combustion due to their
small size, but the number of lines within the databases for each spe-
cies varies considerably (e.g. (cid:1) 170,000 lines for CO2, (cid:1) 12,000 lines
for C2H2 in HITRAN) based on the relative number of active vibra-
tional modes, the linestrength cutoff implemented in models, and
the degree of investigation.

PIt should be noted that most spectroscopic databases have been
constructed with low-temperature data and applications (e.g., atmo-
spheric sensing) in mind, and combustion scientists must be cau-
tious when utilizing these basic data for high-temperature
simulations. Limitations of spectral modeling at combustion temper-
atures using data acquired at lower temperatures is largely due to
insufficiency of the power law for modeling the temperature-depen-
dence of collisional-broadening and pressure-shift as mentioned in
Section 3.1.2. The Carbon Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank (CDSD)
and HITEMP are notable exceptions, with line lists for five key com-
bustion species (H2O, CO2, CO, NO, OH) created to more accurately
represent high-temperature spectra at 1000 K or above. While man-
aged independently, the current version of HITEMP (2010) incorpo-
rates parameters of CDSD-1000 [88]. More recently, the CDSD,
managed by Tashkun et al., released CDSD-4000 [89], a line list
developed for the temperature range of 2500 to 5000 K. Another
high-temperature, species-specific line list is the BT2 water database
developed by Barber et al.
[90], which was used to inform
HITEMP2010.

P3.2.2. Cross-section data

PFor larger combustion species, such as fuels and larger fuel
intermediates ((cid:1) C3 or higher), the high number of vibrational
modes and corresponding infrared-active bands yield more
daunting spectra to model on a line-by-line basis. This is exacer-
bated by the increased difficulty to experimentally investigate
individual rovibrational transitions due to the more crowded and
blended spectra, even at very low pressures. As such, spectro-
scopic data for these larger molecules are more commonly
documented in a cross-section format at a given condition (tem-
perature, pressure, composition). The absorption cross-section is
most often resolved as a function of wavelength using a Fourier-
Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Two of the most com-
prehensive efforts to collect and aggregate infrared cross-section

Pdata have been led by the Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL)
[91] and the National
Institute of Standard and Technology
(NIST) [92] with each database containing hundreds of species
and thousands of spectra. The majority of these spectra are col-
lected at or very near room temperature, with the PNNL data-
base offering spectra up to 50(cid:4) C, and use nitrogen as the
balance gas for various concentrations of the absorber. Due to
the limited temperature range of the cross-section data in PNNL
and NIST, the spectra for various fuels of interest to combustion
must be cautiously used with regards to wavelength selection
for high-temperature sensing applications. Yet another option,
however, is to use uncatalogued data published by a wide range
of researchers, some of which is discussed in the next section.

P3.2.3. Uncatalogued data

PEfforts to aggregate and standardize the format of spectro-
scopic data on a line-by-line or cross-section basis inherently
require limitations of scope that leave an enormous amount of
published spectroscopic data without centralized access. A signif-
icant portion of this uncatalogued data has been produced for
combustion sensing purposes and falls into two primary catego-
ries: (1) high-temperature data, and (2) data collected with com-
bustion species (e.g. CO2, H2O) as bath gas. Errors associated
with extrapolating spectroscopic parameters (e.g., collisional-
broadening coefficients) to high temperatures and the need to
interrogate high-E00 transitions have motivated the development
of the former, while collision-partner-specific collision broaden-
ing has motivated the latter. Fig. 8, reprinted from Sur et al. [86],
highlights
the impact of balance gas composition on the
observed absorption spectra for NH3 at slightly elevated temper-
atures, representative of combustion exhaust. CO2 and H2O have
been observed to have collisional broadening coefficients that
are much more than twice that of nitrogen or air, such that a gas
mixture with only perhaps 5(cid:3)10% of these combustion species
can significantly alter the lineshape and peak absorption for a
given transition. While documenting all such relevant but unca-
talogued infrared data is beyond the scope of this paper, we note
some recent contributions (either at high temperature or with
combustion species as balance gas) that have been made for a
number of molecules found in combustion flows including: H2O
[46,76,90,93(cid:3)98], HCl [99,100], CO2 [101(cid:3)104], CO [105(cid:3)107],
CH4 [108(cid:3)110], C2H4 [111], C3H6 [112,113],
iC4H8 [114], NO
[115], NO2 [116], N2O [117], and NH3 [86,118(cid:3)120]. In addition,
temperature-, pressure-, and bath-gas-dependent cross sections
for a large number of hydrocarbons at elevated temperatures
have been published [112,121(cid:3)124].
It should be noted that

Precent efforts have been taken to integrate and centralize spec-
troscopic data at the simulation and visualization level such that
many data-types and databases (line-by-line, cross-section, etc.)
may be readily utilized together for spectral modeling [125]. This
approach provides for opportunity to integrate current uncata-
logued data and future data that may not fit into the more
focused scope of existing databases.

4. Techniques

PThis section discusses the fundamentals of the most common
LAS techniques; recent applications of these techniques are dis-
cussed in Sections 8 through 13. Specifically, two categories of
LAS techniques will be discussed: direct absorption and wave-
length-modulation spectroscopy and these techniques will be
further broken into the subcategories: fixed wavelength or
scanned wavelength. In the former, the laser’s wavelength is res-
onant with an absorption transition of interest and constant in
time (for DA) or sinusoidally modulated about a fixed wave-
length (for WMS). In the latter, the laser’s wavelength is scanned
across a portion of the absorption spectrum of interest, and in
WMS, this wavelength scanning is accompanied by simultaneous
sinusoidal wavelength modulation performed at a much higher
frequency (typically 50 to 100 times greater than scan rate). In
addition, a variety of hyperspectral direct-absorption techniques
have emerged in the last 15 years and, due to their unique abili-
ties, will be discussed separately from conventional scanned-
wavelength DA.

PFixed-wavelength techniques are inherently less robust due to
their limited spectral information and, as a result, are typically only
used when extreme time resolution (order of MHz) is required and
non-absorbing transmission losses are negligible or can be corrected
for (e.g., with use of a non-resonant laser [126]). Fixed-wavelength
direct absorption has been used extensively and effectively in
shock-tube studies of chemical kinetics [2,127], and some work has
been done in IC-engines [128] and pulse-detonation combustors
[108,126].

PCurrently, the majority of laser-absorption sensor development
for combustion flows revolves around advancing the state of
scanned-wavelength techniques due to their (1) increased robust-
ness and versatility, (2) increased potential for monitoring practical
combustion systems, and consequently, (3) their increased complex-
ity (compared to fixed-wavelength techniques). As a result, this sec-
tion will focus on describing the fundamentals of the various LAS
techniques, as well as, their application to cavity-enhanced configu-
rations.

4.1. Scanned-wavelength direct-absorption spectroscopy

PScanned-wavelength direct absorption (scanned-DA) was first
applied to combustion gases in the late 1970s [13(cid:3)15], and due to
its wide applicability, ease of operation, and relatively simple data
interpretation, continues to be widely used to study combustion
when SNR-levels permit [106,129(cid:3)131]. Modern scanned-DA is typ-
ically performed with distributed-feedback diode, interband-, or
In this case, the laser’s wavelength is

scanned (via injection-current tuning) across one or a few absorp-
tion transitions to resolve the absorption spectrum of interest (see
Fig. 9a). Gas properties are then calculated from the absorbance at a
given wavelength or, more typically, from the integrated absorbance
using Eq. (2) or (4), respectively. In harsh combustion environments,
scanned-DA can suffer from low SNR, particularly in cases of low-
absorbance (a < 0.01). To overcome this, numerous researchers
have developed more advanced diagnostic techniques (e.g., WMS,
Hyperspectral-DA) discussed in the following subsections.

4.2. Hyperspectral direct-absorption spectroscopy

PStrictly speaking, scanned-DA is typically used to describe cases
where the laser’s wavelength/frequency is tuned over a narrow
spectral range ((cid:1) 0.1 to 10 cm¡1) to resolve one or several absorp-
tion transitions. Here, hyperspectral direct-absorption spectroscopy
(hyperspectral-DA) will be used to refer to all direct-absorption
techniques spanning a region of the spectrum greater than 10 cm¡1;
further distinction will only be provided when necessary. Such
techniques have been referred to as wavelength-agile DA
[34,36,132,133],
supercontinuum
swept-wavelength DA [38],
absorption [134], and frequency-comb spectroscopy [135], typically
to indicate differences in the type of light source used and these dif-
ferences are discussed in detail in Section 6. Regardless of these dif-
ferences, all hyperspectral-DA techniques are used to measure a
large portion of an absorption band, frequently at very high rates (10
to 100 kHz). The linewidth of these sources varies greatly, from order
of kHz (e.g., frequency combs) to near-GHz (e.g., FDML sources). This
unique combination of features has mandated the use of a variety of
unique data processing and spectral-fitting techniques to overcome
challenges associated with large datasets and the need to accurately
model significant portions of an absorption band, at times, convo-
luted with an estimated instrument function. Despite these com-
plexities, hyperspectral-DA techniques have demonstrated the
ability to overcome most of the challenges limiting conventional
scanned-DA, and as a result, have emerged as one of the most prom-
ising LAS technologies for characterizing harsh combustion environ-
ments.

4.3. Wavelength-modulation spectroscopy

PWavelength- and frequency-modulation spectroscopy were first
developed in the early 1980s [20] to reduce the influence of laser
and detector noise, thereby improving measurement fidelity in gas-

Psensing applications. Since then, wavelength-modulation spectros-
copy has been used extensively to study a wide range of harsh com-
bustion environments [2,27,39,136] particularly due to several
experimental and theoretical advancements enabling robust, cali-
bration-free WMS techniques [40,41,137(cid:3)140]. Typically, the first-
and second-harmonic signals are used to calculate gas properties
and will be the focus here. However it should be noted that using
higher harmonics (3f, 4f, etc.) has been shown to exhibit some
unique advantages, as discussed in Section 5.5 and [141(cid:3)144]. Sev-
eral variants of WMS have been used and will be discussed here,
namely: fixed-WMS, peak-picking scanned-WMS, and scanned-
WMS. A schematic illustrating scanned-WMS-2f/1f
is shown in
Fig. 9b and Fig. 10 illustrates how the WMS-2f/1f signals associated
with each of the aforementioned techniques differ in the Fourier and
time domain. A detailed discussion of these differences can be found
in [145].

PIn fixed-WMS the laser’s wavelength is sinusoidally modulated
(typically via injection current modulation) about a given location
on an absorption feature of interest. The modulation shifts absorp-
tion information to the harmonics of the modulation frequency, f,
and the harmonic signals (1f, 2f, 3f etc.) can be extracted from the
raw detector signal using digital lock-in filters during post-process-
ing [41] or using analog lock-in amplifiers prior to data acquisition.
In this case, the lock-in filter bandwidth defines the theoretical sen-
sor bandwidth. By modulating at high frequencies (f typically from
10 kHz to 1 MHz), the harmonic signals are elevated above lower-
frequency noise sources (e.g., electronic, environmental) which can
improve their SNR [146]. Cassidy and Reid [137] first showed that
when WMS is performed using injection-current tuned lasers (e.g.,
diode lasers, quantum-cascade lasers), the higher harmonics can be
normalized by the 1f signal to remove their dependence on the DC
light intensity impinging on the detector. This attribute enables 1f-
normalized WMS to be immune to intensity variations (e.g., from
beam steering or window fouling or other non-absorption losses)
that vary in time slowly compared to f.

PIn peak-picking scanned-WMS the wavelength modulation is
accompanied by a small-amplitude wavelength scan to resolve the
peak of the WMS-2f/1f signal near linecenter, thereby providing a
known wavelength reference. This improves measurement robust-
ness (removing concerns of unknown laser-wavelength drift) while
minimizing the additional frequency content centered around each
harmonic, thereby reducing potential for cross talk and facilitating
frequency multiplexing of multiple lasers. In this case, only the value
of the WMS-2f/1f signal near the transition linecenter is used to cal-
culate gas properties (see [145]) and the measurement bandwidth is
set by the scan frequency.

PIn scanned-WMS the nominal wavelength of the laser is scanned
across an absorption transition to extract WMS spectra, thereby
enabling spectral fitting and removing the need for a priori knowl-
edge of the transition line broadening [139]. In this case, gas proper-
ties can be extracted from measured WMS spectra analogous to
scanned-wavelength direct absorption using the spectral-fitting
technique developed by Goldenstein et al. [139] (later extended by

P[138(cid:3)140] accurately account for the laser intensity varying during
injection-current scanning (performed to scan the laser’s nominal
wavelength across the absorption transition of interest). It should be
noted that methods for recovering absorption transition lineshapes
have also been developed using WMS-1f signals [147,148]; however,
this approach requires use of non-resonant wavelengths (analogous
to fixed-wavelength direct absorption) to account for non-absorbing
losses.

4.4. Cavity-enhanced techniques

PThe previous sections discussed absorption techniques pri-
marily aimed at improving sensor accuracy and robustness by
rejecting signal noise or increasing the amount of useful infor-
mation extracted by the sensor. However, in reality the sensitiv-
ity of all absorption measurements is fundamentally limited by
the strength of the interrogated absorption transition(s) and/or
the path length over which light interacts with the absorbers.
The former is dictated by the physics of the target species (i.e.,
Einstein-A coefficient, degeneracy, and Boltzmann statistics),
however, the latter can be manipulated by the experimentalist
by conducting the measurement in an optical cavity. This section
will discuss a few of the most useful cavity-enhanced LAS techni-
ques for increasing the sensitivity of LAS sensors.

PThere are three primary cavity-enhanced LAS techniques applica-
ble to combustion applications: (1) intracavity-absorption spectros-
copy, (2) cavity-ring down spectroscopy, and (3) cavity-enhanced
absorption spectroscopy or integrated-cavity output spectroscopy
(ICOS). In intracavity-absorption spectroscopy the test gas is located
within the laser cavity. Absorption transitions within the gain curve
of the laser are sensitively detected by measuring the reduction in
gain at these specific wavelengths. There is a long (40C years) his-
tory of intracavity absorption using broadband laser sources (e.g.,
broadband dye lasers or relatively broadband gas lasers) and the
application to combustion diagnostics has long been recognized. As

Psuch, we refer the reader to an excellent article by Harris [149], as
well as a few recent papers employing fiber lasers [150,151].

PFig. 12 illustrates the operating principles of CRDS and CEAS. Typ-
ically in CRDS, pulsed laser light is injected on-axis into an optical
cavity (formed by two dielectric coated mirrors) and the light inten-
sity exiting the cavity is measured to determine the characteristic
decay time (t). In the limit of no scattering losses, the decay time is
dictated by the reflectivity of the cavity mirrors and the single-pass
absorbance (aSP) given by Eq. (2). With the mirror reflectivity (RM)
known (e.g., from a measurement in the empty cavity), Eq. (17) can
be inverted to solve for aSP and, thus, gas properties.

CRDS with high-finesse (i.e., high-reflectivity) cavities can increase
the optical path by 104 or more, thereby enabling highly sensitive
measurements of trace species. However, these cavities suffer from
very small transmission (typically requiring mode-locking with the
TEM00 cavity-mode) and long residence times of the light which
limits their time response. Furthermore, high-finesse cavities are
highly susceptible to window fouling (e.g., from dust or soot) and
require extreme care to maintain high mirror reflectivity.

PIn comparison,

in CEAS continuous-wave laser light can be
injected into an optical cavity and the intensity of light exiting the
cavity is measured on a photodetector. Although CEAS can be per-
formed with on-axis injection [152], for scanned-wavelength meas-
urements with a spectrally narrow laser, the use of off-axis injection
significantly reduces laser-coupling noise on the light transmitted
through the cavity [152,153]. By using off-axis injection the reflec-
tions are separated in space as they move around the perimeter of
each mirror and many roundtrips are required before the light retra-
ces its initial trajectory and overlaps upon itself. This leads to an
effective cavity length on the order of m to km and, therefore, a free-
spectral range that is comparable to the laser linewidth and is much
smaller than the absorption transition HWHM. As a result, scanned-
wavelength techniques can be employed to measure absorption
spectra and the non-absorbing baseline. Gas properties are calcu-
lated using Eq. (18) (an analogue of Beer’s Law) and a spectroscopic
model.

Here, aCEAS is the measured, cavity-enhanced absorption and G is the
cavity gain set by the mirror reflectivity (determined by CRDS or cal-
ibration).

PCEAS has been used extensively in high-finesses configurations
for trace-gas sensing [154(cid:3)157] and the use of WMS has also been
explored [158], however, like CRDS these methods suffer from long
cavity residence times and susceptibility to mirror fouling. Recently,
low finesse (gain of 100£ in path length) cavities have been inte-
grated into shock tubes to improve the measurement sensitivity of
combustion species while maintaining measurement
rates
((cid:1)100 kHz) sufficient to resolve reaction kinetics [159,160] and
these studies are highlighted in Section 8.1.

PIt should be noted that there is a long history of using intracavity
laser absorption and CRDS for combustion diagnostics, especially to
monitor the concentration of minor reactive species. Much of this
work has focused on the distribution of radicals in low-pressure
flames using transitions in the visible and ultra-violet to test models
of flame chemistry. Since this work is beyond the scope of this paper
(being outside the IR domain), we refer the interested reader to
excellent reviews by Cheskis [161] and by Mercier and Desgroux
[162] who have been pioneers of intracavity laser absorption and
CRDS for combustion applications.

5. Measurement challenges and solutions

PThis section will discuss some of the most common challenges
and current solutions pertaining to IR-LAS sensors for combustion
gases. Our discussion will focus on challenges with evolving solu-
tions, and we will simply refer the reader to the appendices in
[163,164] for more standard solutions to an assortment of conven-
tional problems (e.g., free-space fiber coupling, wavelength jitter).

5.1. Solutions for nonuniform flows

PLaser-absorption spectroscopy provides a path-integrated mea-
surement. In cases where the gas conditions vary along the measure-
ment line-of-sight, the measured absorbance is given by Eq. (19).

PThe path integral

in Eq. (19) complicates the relationship
between the measured absorbance and gas properties and a thor-
ough discussion regarding the influence of nonuniform temperature,
pressure, and composition can be found in [165]. Briefly, the mea-
sured absorbance is influenced by linear and non-linear dependen-
ces on pressure and absorbing-species mole fraction and a non-
linear dependence on temperature through the transition line-
strength and lineshape function. The non-linear dependencies can
lead to the path-integrated measurement deviating from path-aver-
aged gas properties unless certain measures are taken [165].

PDespite this complication several researchers have developed
strategies to provide useful and quantitative measurements of
gas properties in non-uniform gases [32,165(cid:3)176]. This section
will focus on discussing solutions applicable to single-LOS meas-
urements, however, a discussion of some of the most widely
used and emerging tomographic LAS techniques will conclude
this section.

P5.1.1. Single line-of-sight solutions

PSeveral researchers have developed strategies to identify temper-
ature non-uniformities [168,170,172] and quantify the measure-
ment uncertainty they induce [176]. Seitzman and Scully [168]
developed a broadband sensor for monitoring temperature non-
uniformity and H2O mole fraction in a gas-turbine combustor. By
measuring the absorbance in at least three spectral windows with

Pdifferent temperature dependence, two temperatures can be calcu-
lated (one “cold” and one “hot”) with the difference between them
quantifying how thermally non-uniform the flow is. A similar strat-
egy was later used by Palaghita and Seitzman [171], Liu et al. [172],
and Goldenstein et al. [145] using diode lasers to resolve individual
absorption transitions for a simplified interpretation. Rieker et al.
[43] built upon this technique by monitoring differences in the fre-
quency content (from an FFT) of the “cold” and “hot” temperatures
and showed that the measurements of fluctuations could be used to
predict scramjet unstart.

PStrategies have also been developed to reduce sensitivity to non-
uniform gas conditions [167(cid:3)169]. For example, Ouyang and Var-
ghese [167] developed a strategy for measuring absolute absorbing-
species concentration in the presence of thermal and concentration
boundary layers. This strategy relies on the use of transitions with
specific values of lower-state energy such that the absorption mea-
surement is insensitive to gases in the boundary layer, and relations
are put forth to identify suitable values of E00 for a given temperature
of interest in the limit of small boundary layers. In their broadband
absorption sensor, Seitzman and Scully [168] used a spectral win-
dow where the absorbance is nearly independent of temperature to
measure H2O mole fraction with a maximum error of 8% for an
unknown temperature (or temperature non-uniformity) from 1000
to 2100 K.

PSeveral LAS techniques have been developed to correct for
or tolerate the large non-uniformities encountered in flames
[165,166,177]. Schoenung and Hanson [166] acquired thermocouple
and line-of-sight absorption measurements at multiple locations
spanning the transverse (relative to the flow) axis of the flame to
correct the path-integrated absorption measurement of CO assum-
ing axisymmetric temperature and species distributions. Golden-
stein et al. [165] developed a two-color LAS strategy for measuring
the absorbing-species column density, Ni, and absorbing-species-
; given by Eqs. (20) and
weighted path-averaged temperature, T ni
(21), respectively, and showed that this technique is more accurate
over a broad temperature range than a constant-linestrength
approximation (similar to that used in [168]).

This strategy requires use of absorption transitions with a line-
strength that varies near linearly with temperature over the domain
of the temperature non-uniformity. This can be achieved by using
transitions with specific values of lower-state energy and is shown
to be accurate over large temperature non-uniformities (500 to
1000 K) at combustion temperatures (> 1000 K). This strategy was
later deployed to study flames in a scramjet combustor [178] and
low-pressure burner [177].

PSingle-LOS strategies have also been developed to measure LOS
distributions of temperature and composition [170,173]. Sanders
et al. [170] developed a strategy for recovering a discretized LOS dis-
tribution of temperature by scanning a VCSEL across 10 O2 A-band
transitions with a unique temperature dependence. In this technique
the LOS is discretized into bins and a system of linear equations is
solved to determine the mole fraction and temperature in each bin.
The discretized solution is then least-squares fit to a distribution
function to provide a finer solution grid (provided that a representa-
tive distribution function is known a priori). The authors clarify that
this technique works best when a distribution function can be
assumed as the discretization technique alone may either be too
coarse or ill-conditioned. Liu et al. [173] later built upon this tech-
nique by developing (1) a profile-fitting technique to solve for the
defining parameters of a postulated temperature distribution profile

Pand (2) a temperature binning technique to determine the probabil-
ity density function of prescribed temperature bins along the LOS.
These techniques were demonstrated in a two-temperature experi-
ment using 5 fiber-coupled diode lasers targeting H2O absorption
transitions.

P5.1.2. Laser-absorption tomography

PA wide range of laser-absorption-tomography (LAT) (a subclass of
chemical species tomography (CST)) techniques have been devel-
oped and used to reconstruct 2D chemical-species, temperature, and
pressure fields in combustion gases [129,179(cid:3)189], and several
excellent reviews have been devoted to this subject [190(cid:3)192]. In
particular, the most recent review by Cai and Kaminski [192] pro-
vides an excellent overview of LAT and its application to combustion
studies. In tomography, multiple lines-of-sight are used to sample a
heterogeneous measurement volume from unique viewpoints and
the measured projections (i.e., path-integrated absorption) are used
to reconstruct the 2D (or even 3D) field. In contrast to medical-imag-
ing techniques employing 1000s of LOS (e.g., MRI, CT scan), LAT typi-
cally employs only 10 to 100s of LOS due to the optical-access
limitations imposed by combustion applications. This sparse sam-
pling precludes the use of the Fourier-transform-based algorithms
(e.g., filtered backprojection) employed in medical imaging, and
requires a distinct approach.

PIn most LAT applications, the 2D field is reconstructed from mea-
sured projections by solving a linear systems of equations, Ax D b;
where the m £ n matrix A specifies the known path length of each
ray through each pixel, the m-vector b contains the measured pro-
jections for each line-of-sight, and the n-vector x specifies the
unknown (i.e., to-be-solved for) absorbance or species-concentra-
tion in each pixel. A multitude of algorithms have been developed to
solve for x (e.g., in a least-squares sense or though minimization of
an objective quantity) and address the ill-posed nature of this prob-
lem (i.e., multiple solutions often exist or the solution is unstable
and sensitive to input noise) [193,194], including algebraic-recon-
struction tomography (ART), simultaneous-ART (SART) [195], statis-
tical image reconstruction (SIR) [196], and total-variation-based
compressed sensing (TVCS) [197,198]. Daun et al. [191] points out
that it is particularly important to distinguish between two cases in
order to identify the most well-suited approach: (1) A is discrete ill-
posed [199] (e.g., when employing dense sampling of the tomogra-
phy space) or, more likely in combustion applications, (2) the matrix
equation is rank deficient (e.g., when employing sparse sampling)
and, therefore, a priori information about the flow field is required to
identify a unique solution.

PRecently, hyperspectral-tomography (HT) techniques have been
developed and deployed to reconstruct 2D temperature and H2O-
concentration fields [179,180,183,200]. This method utilizes many
absorption transitions, thereby adding increased spectral informa-
tion to the reconstruction process. In practice, the temperature and
species-concentration fields are reconstructed by minimizing the
function:

using the reconstructed T and X profile (denoted Trec and Xrec),

locations, respectively. For context, 12 unique wavelengths (chosen
using the methods presented in [201]) were used for the jet-engine
exhaust sensing presented in [183]. The authors state that this
method has several advantages, including: (1) reducing the number
of projections required for accurate tomographic reconstruction,

ature and species concentration simultaneously.

5.2. Beam steering and emission

PIn harsh combustion environments the effective baseline Io may
vary in time due to non-absorbing transmission losses (e.g., from
window fouling, light scattering or beam steering) or fluctuations in
background emission. If these losses or gains in light intensity are
not properly accounted for or avoided, the gas properties inferred
from the detector signal will be incorrect.

PIn direct absorption, these challenges are typically mitigated
using rapid and/or broad wavelength scanning such that these con-
founding effects are constant during the measurement time and can
be more accurately accounted for. For example, baseline emission
levels can be recorded in-between pulses or scans, assumed constant
during the measurement, and subtracted from the measured detec-
tor signal during the measurement time. In addition, non-absorbing
transmission losses in Io can be accounted for if constant or near-
constant during the measurement by floating the baseline intensity
in spectral-fitting routines. Broad wavelength tuning can improve
the robustness of the latter by increasing the amount of spectro-
scopic information relative to the uncertainty in baseline.

PIn WMS, high-frequency modulation and 1f-normalization are
used to reject background emission and non-absorbing variations in
light intensity that vary slowly compared to f. As a result, measured
1f-normalized WMS spectra are inherently immune to such trans-
mission variations and no corrections are required during post-proc-
essing. However, despite 1f-normalization, variations in Io that occur
at frequencies comparable to f can introduce noise in the WMS sig-
nals. To reduce this noise one must improve the light collection effi-
ciency or modulate at higher frequencies to escape the frequency
spectrum of the noise and/or increase the bandwidth over which 1f-
normalization applies.

PSeveral researchers have also developed strategies for minimiz-
ing beam-steering effects via optical engineering. For example,
Petersen [204] (and most recently Spearrin et al. [115]) found that
using an integrating sphere can dramatically reduce beam-steering
effects in high-pressure gases and rigorous design rules for maximiz-
ing light-collection efficiency are presented. Kranendonk et al. [205]
developed a general design framework for minimizing the influence
of beam steering without requiring a priori knowledge of the beam
steering field. Whitney et al. [206] provides a detailed analysis and
discussion describing how to minimize beam-steering effects in sen-
sors employing multi-mode fibers, and presents the design of a

Psensor using a fused-fiber lens and fiber-fused detector that mini-
mizes the influence of a spatially non-uniform detector response.
Most recently, Strand [207] showed that using an aspheric-lens dou-
blet to collimate and focus light exiting a multi-mode catch fiber
onto a detector can also dramatically improve tolerance to beam
steering in fiber-coupled assemblies.

5.3. Broad and blended spectra

PBroad and blended absorbance spectra complicate the determi-
nation of gas properties in three primary ways: (1) the absorption
spectra at a given wavelength is governed by multiple transitions
which have a unique dependence on gas conditions (T, P, x), (2) non-
absorbing wavelengths may not exist nearby, complicating or pre-
cluding in situ determination of the non-absorbing baseline, and (3)
differential absorbance and WMS-2f signals are smaller.

PThe first complication has been addressed by several researchers
by developing wavelength- and modulation-depth-selection rou-
tines that account for the influence of neighboring transitions
[203,208(cid:3)210]. For example, An et al. [208,209] developed a quan-
tity (the frequency-dependent lower-state energy) for quantifying
the temperature sensitivity of a given wavelength and showed it
could be used to identify the optimal wavelengths for thermometry.
Goldenstein et al. [203] showed that by using wavelengths and spe-
cific modulation depths in regions of temperature-dependent spec-
tral curvature, two-color WMS-2f/1f thermometry and mole fraction
sensing could be performed using a single modulation depth over a
range of 1000 to 3500 K and 5 to 50 bar (see Fig. 13b).

PThe second complication only pertains to direct-absorption tech-
niques, and this challenge has been overcome by using an additional
non-resonant light source (e.g., see [108,126,128,211]) or broadly
tunable light sources (e.g., see [33,34,202,212,213]). Fig. 13a illus-
trates the wealth of spectral information that hyperspectral light
sources can extract, enabling the baseline intensity to be floated in
spectral-fitting routines. Several strategies for hyperspectral-base-
line fitting have been developed and demonstrated (at low and high
pressures), and indicate that using a baseline that is smooth relative
to the absorption spectra is best [214,215]. However, in the former
approach it is critical to use non-resonant wavelengths as close to
the resonant wavelengths as possible to minimize differences in
wavelength-specific transmission losses (e.g., from droplet or partic-
ulate scattering) [126].

PThe last complication pertains to WMS, and this challenge has
been overcome by using large modulation depths [42,210,216,217]
and, most recently, by combining large modulation depths with

Pstrong mid-infrared absorption [46,101,106,203]. WMS-1f sensing
has also been demonstrated as an effective technique for sensing
molecules with extremely broad spectra (e.g., large hydrocarbons
and gasoline [218]). While WMS-1f is not immune to non-absorbing
transmission losses, it is immune to background emission, as well
as, laser and detector noise that exist outside the bandwidth of the
lock-in filter used.

5.4. Breakdown of the impact approximation

PAs discussed previously in Section 5.4, at high number densities
the impact approximation can break down, thereby introducing
errors in spectroscopic models that do not account for this. Since the
impact approximation primarily affects the absorption transition
wings, such errors can be mitigated by using wavelengths near line-
center. However, if multiple absorption transitions are overlapping
(as is likely the case at number densities where the impact approxi-
mation breaks down), the contribution from neighboring transitions
to the region near linecenter may be significant. In this case, Rieker
et al. [63,79] showed that WMS-2f signal can be less susceptible to
such errors since the contribution to differential absorbance (across
the modulation depth) resulting from the far-wings of neighboring
transitions can be small.

5.5. Non-zero WMS background

PReal semiconductor lasers do not respond perfectly linearly to
injection-current tuning (i.e., sinusoidal current modulation results
in intensity modulation with frequency components at 1f, 2f, 3f,
etc.). As a result, the higher harmonic signals exhibit a non-zero
background from higher-order intensity modulation (often referred
to as residual amplitude modulation (RAM)). The RAM background
decreases with increasing harmonic
[141,142,144,219], but
increases with increasing modulation frequency and modulation
depth [40]. Li et al. [40] showed that for telecommunication-grade
TDLs the second-order intensity modulation exhibits a quasi-qua-
dratic dependence on the modulation depth, with a maximum value
of (cid:1) 3% for 100% intensity modulation. However, it should be noted
that we have found these results can vary substantially depending
on the type of diode laser and manufacturer. To solve this issue, cali-
bration-free WMS models that account for higher-order intensity
modulation can be used [40,41,138,139] or a measured intensity
time history (in the absence of absorbers) can be used to simulate
WMS signals in the recently developed brute-force calibration-free
WMS models [138,139]. The latter approach can also be used to
account for WMS background signals resulting from etalon effects in
the beam path, and as a result, is currently the most accurate method
if the etalons are stable. However, several researchers have shown
that dithering of optical components [220], intelligent triggering
timing [143], intelligent selection of the modulation depth [139],
and the use of higher harmonics (e.g., 4f) [141,142,144] can all be
used to reduce WMS background signals originating from etalon
effects.

5.6. 1f-normalization with large absorbance

P1f normalization is optimal for, but not limited to, cases where
the absorbance is small such that the 1f signal is dominated by the
laser’s intensity modulation. As the peak absorbance increases, the
1f signal near linecenter approaches zero. As a result, even small
noise levels are magnified, leading to a WMS-2f/1f signal that can
vary widely and erroneously near linecenter. This effect typically
becomes problematic at absorbances greater than (cid:1)0.5. However,
the 1f signal away from linecenter typically remains sufficiently
large for 1f normalization. This can be exploited by normalizing the
higher harmonic signals by the scan-averaged 1f signal, as opposed

Pto the local 1f signal which, to the best of our knowledge, was first
demonstrated in [138].

6. Sources and hardware

PThis section will discuss the capabilities and limitations of both
established and emerging light sources and hardware that are rele-
vant to IR-LAS. Our discussion will focus on light sources, although
detectors, optical fibers and materials will also be discussed. A
detailed discussion regarding the selection of optical equipment for
laser spectroscopy can also be found in Chapter 13 of Hanson, Spear-
rin, and Goldenstein [10].

6.1. Near-infrared hardware

PHistorically, the majority of LAS sensors for combustion systems
have operated in the near-infrared ((cid:1)760 to (cid:1)2500 nm) in order to
leverage the robust and affordable hardware born out of the tele-
communication industry in the 1990s. While the detection limit of
these sensors is limited by the weaker absorption strength of the
overtone and combination bands located in the near-IR, they have
achieved widespread success, particularly in the detection of highly
anharmonic absorbers (e.g., H2O, HF, HCl, NH3) due to their greater
absorption strength (only (cid:1)10 times less than their fundamental
bands) and in flows with large quanitites of weaker absorbers or
potential for long path-length measurements. This section will dis-
cuss some of the most widely used near-IR light sources and hard-
ware to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

P6.1.1. Distributed-feedback (DFB) and distributed-Bragg reflector (DBR)
tunable diode lasers

PDiode lasers fabricated with a Bragg grating distributed along the
gain medium (DFB) or as a cavity end-mirror (DBR) provide single-
mode laser output that can be injection current tuned over a moder-
ate wavelength range, which is useful for scanned-wavelength
absorption techniques. In general, lasers with DFB architecture have
a wider tuning range while the DBR architecture leads to more stable
single-mode performance at higher laser powers. Although either
DFB or DBR lasers are quite suitable for LAS sensors, the vast major-
ity of the single-mode lasers that are currently commercially avail-
able in the telecommunications region are DFB devices and most of
the applied TDLAS work described later employed DFB TDLs. As a
result, the remainder of this section will focus on the characteristics
of DFB TDLs.

PDFB TDLs are one of the most widely used lasers due to their
low cost, wavelength stability, rapid wave-
ease-of-operation,
length tunability, and ability to be manufactured over a wide
range of custom wavelengths (760 nm to 3 mm). These DFB TDLs
typically produce 5 to 25 mW of power with a laser linewidth <
5 MHz, leading to negligible instrument broadening. In addition,
DFB TDLs are frequently available in fiber-pigtail packages fur-
ther facilitating their integration into LAS sensors suitable for
the field. In a DFB TDL, a p-n junction acts as a lasing medium
and the bandgap (i.e., the energy gap between the conduction
and valence bands) of the semiconductor sets the range of wave-
lengths emitted. A diffraction grating (located near the p-n junc-
tion) is used to effectively filter the emitted light and reflect a
single wavelength back into the gain medium for lasing. By
changing the temperature of the laser (directly or via current
tuning i.e., ohmic heating) the grating resonance is adjusted, and
the emitting wavelength is tuned.

PIn practice, these lasers are typically operated by commercial
temperature and current controllers with wavelength tuning
achieved via external injection-current modulation. Depending on
the manufacturer and type of semiconductor used, the wavelength
of DFB TDLs can typically be injection-current tuned from 1 to

to around 0.01 to 0.1 cm¡1 at modulation frequencies on the order
of 100 kHz [40,203]. This tunability enables the measurement of sev-
eral adjacent absorption lines at modest rates (order of 1 kHz) [221]
and portions thereof at high-frequencies (order of 100 kHz) as done
in WMS [40,203,216].

P100 MHz (cid:3) 1 GHz bandwidth) in order to resolve the fast wave-
length scanning (as is the case for all rapid hyperspectral techni-
ques). It is worth noting that the MEMS VCSEL has effectively
rendered such FDML sources obsolete due to its narrower linewidth
(near 500 MHz at a repetition rate near 50 kHz) and ease of use
[224].

P6.1.4. Dispersed supercontinuum sources

PLike FDML lasers, dispersed supercontinuum sources (DSS) can
provide high-repetition rate, broadband measurements of absorp-
tion spectra with a moderate linewidth ((cid:1)1GHz to 1 THz)
[132,134,228(cid:3)234]. To name a few examples, supercontinuum sour-
ces have been used to measure acetylene [132,228,229], and H2O
and CO2 in gas cells [132], CH4 in atmospheric pressure jets [231]
and flames [134,234], and H2O in an HCCI engine [230].

PThese sources use a dispersing optical fiber (recent work has
shown that using an all-normal-dispersion fiber improves single-
shot measurement SNR substantially [235] thereby reducing the
need for averaging) or other non-linear optical component to sepa-
rate the wavelengths contained within a broadband ps- or fs-pulse
in time. The net result is that faster-travelling wavelengths reach the
detector first, effectively producing a swept wavelength source and
enabling the measurement of transmission spectra, and ultimately
absorption spectra, in the time-domain. These concepts are illus-
trated in Fig. 15. Until recently, most previous studies using DSSs
were focused on fundamental studies with long and/or multi-pass
path lengths (> 10 cm) and lacked use and validation in combustion
gases [132,228,229,231(cid:3)233]. Blume and Wagner [134] recently
reported single-pass measurements (spanning 4.1 cm) of CH4 mole
fraction in a well-characterized non-premixed,
laminar CH4-air
flame. The DSS enabled measurement across 110 cm¡1 of the CH4
absorption band near 1650 nm with a resolution of 0.152 cm¡1 at a
repetition rate of 2 MHz. A spectral-fitting routine was employed to
calculate absolute mole fractions and measurements were able to

P6.1.2. Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs)

PVCSELs are a type of diode laser where light is emitted perpendic-
ular to the semiconductor wafer (in comparison to edge-emitting
lasers that emit radiation parallel to the surface). The resonator is
formed by two Bragg mirrors with an active region spanning only a
few mm in-between. In comparison to edge-emitting DFB or DBR
lasers, VCSELs produce much lower optical power (order of 1 mW).
However, they can exhibit superior wavelength tunability (near
10 cm¡1 at modulation frequencies near 1 MHz) which has been
exploited to acquire increased spectral information, for example, for
resolving line-of-sight temperature distributions [170] and colli-
sion-broadened lines in high-pressure gases [33,213]. At present,
VCSELs are available from 750 to 1000 nm and near 1300, 1550 and
2000 nm and have been used to measure O2 [33,170], H2O [213], CO
and CO2 [222], and CO [223], respectively, to name only a few exam-
ples. In addition, recently a micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) VCSEL
capable of scanning from 1330 to 1365 nm at 100 kHz became com-
mercially available and has been used for hyperspectral measure-
ments of H2O and temperature [224] in combustion flows [202].

P6.1.3. Fourier-domain mode locked (FDML) lasers

PFDML lasers [225,226] are capable of providing broad spectral
coverage (up to 100 nm) at high repetition rates (order of 100 kHz)
with a moderate linewidth ((cid:1)3 GHz). A schematic illustrating the
operating principles of FDML lasers is shown in Fig. 14 (taken from
[227]). These lasers consist of three primary components: a fiber-
coupled semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), a ring-fiber-based
resonator, and a Fabry-Perot tunable filter (FP-TF). Upon startup,
broadband amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) leaving the SOA
travels to the sinusoidally modulated FP-TF which passes a time-
varying wavelength, thereby effectively sweeping the wavelength
exiting the FP-TF. This filtered light (dispersed in time) then passes
back to the SOA for amplification via stimulated emission and the
process repeats. By modulating the FP-TF with a drive period corre-
sponding to the round-trip time of light in the cavity, each wave-
length passed by the filter is passed on each subsequent roundtrip
ensuring amplification and refinement of the wavelength sweep.
The sweep rate can be varied by altering the length of the fiber-ring
cavity [212].

PFDML lasers have been deployed in a variety of combustion flows
for hyperspectral ((cid:1)10 to 100 nm) measurements of H2O (and gas
properties thereof) near 1.3 to 1.4 mm [36(cid:3)38,183,212]. Their high
sweep-rates makes them well suited for studying transient combus-
tion flows but this, combined with their broad spectral coverage,
mandates the use of extremely fast detection electronics (order of

Presolve 3% CH4 by volume (1210 ppm-m) after averaging 9760
pulses for a near 200 Hz measurement rate. The results were also
shown to agree well with previous measurements acquired in the
burner indicating that DSSs have the potential for accurate measure-
ments of combustion species in flames.

P6.1.5. Optical fibers

PSilica-based fibers and fiber components have been developed by
large investments from the telecommunications industry and, as a
result, fiber optics (e.g., couplers, interferometers) are widely avail-
able from 1.25 to 2 mm. Now, single-mode and polarization-main-
taining fibers with low bend-losses are available well beyond 2 mm
(e.g., NuFern). These fiber components enable the lasers, detectors
and automatic data processing electronics to be remotely located
away from combustion systems, thereby avoiding exposure to ele-
vated temperatures and, potentially, large acoustic and electrical
noise.

P6.1.6. Detectors

PIn near-IR-LAS, the most commonly used detectors are made
from silicon (Si) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs). Silicon detec-
tors are responsive from (cid:1)200 to 1100 nm, and are frequently used
in sensors for O2 that exploit the A-band transitions near 760 nm.
InGaAs and extended-InGaAs detectors are sensitive from (cid:1)800 to
1700 nm and 1200 to 2600 nm, respectively. These detectors do not
require cooling, and have a rapid time response ranging from 100s
of kHz to GHz depending on element size and amplification. Further,
they exhibit excellent noise-equivalent power values (order of
¡12 W/Hz1/2). While other options exist for a portion of this
1£10
wavelength range (namely, germanium (Ge), indium arsenide anti-
monide (InAsSb), indium antimonide (InSb), and mecury cadmium
telluride (MCT)), the trade-offs associated with using these alterna-
tive detectors (e.g., lower bandwidth, thermoelectric or cryo-cooling
requirements) are typically not justified in the near-IR. That said,
alternate detector materials should be considered when working at
wavelengths near the red extrema ((cid:1) 2500 nm) of the InGaAs band-
width. More information regarding these detectors can be found in
Section 6.2.4.

6.2. Mid-infrared hardware

PAdvances in mid-infrared ((cid:1)2.5 to 12 mm) optical equipment
over the past 15 years has provided several new capabilities for LAS
sensing in combustion environments. Most significantly, the funda-
mental vibrational frequencies of most combustion species are in
this domain, and typically provide several orders of magnitude
greater absorption relative to the overtone and combination bands
in the near-infrared. This allows for (a) more sensitive detection
and/or (b) detection at shorter pathlengths. Increasingly convenient
access to the mid-infrared has enabled new applications of LAS in
short path-length combustion systems that were simply not feasible
in the near-infrared nor were conducive for studying via fixed-wave-
length mid-IR gas lasers (e.g., HeNe near 3.39 mm, CO near 5 mm,
CO2 near 10.6 mm). For example, the high-fidelity measurements of
CO in scramjet [236] and detonation combustors [237,238] were
made possible through the use of quantum-cascade lasers enabling
access to 104 times greater absorption strength compared to that
accessible via telecommunication-grade lasers. More of these new
applications are highlighted in the latter part of this paper. Here we
offer brief descriptions of key hardware for laser absorption in the
mid-IR, with a focus on recent advancements.

P6.2.1. Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs)

PQCLs are semiconductor lasers that can emit in the mid-infrared
to far-infrared ((cid:1)3.5 to 100 mm) with similar tuning capability and
usability to room-temperature diode lasers. Unlike diode lasers the

Pemission wavelength is not purely a material property (i.e. band
gap), but rather the result of an engineered superlattice, a layered
composite of semiconducting materials that introduces a variable
electric potential across the length of the system. Electron transi-
tions and photon emission occur and cascade (via tunneling)
between the subbands of each layer. The respective energy levels
between each layer and emission wavelength depend on the respec-
tive layer thicknesses and can be designed to cover a broad spectral
region with a given material set. The first demonstration of the
quantum cascade laser occurred at Bell Laboratories in 1994 [239].
Rapid improvement in manufacturing and lasing properties (i.e.,
tuning range, efficiency, power) has followed [240(cid:3)242]. Similar to
diode lasers, wavelength tuning of a QCL can be achieved with a dis-
tributed feedback or external cavity architecture, with the latter
offering greater range ((cid:1)100 cm¡1) at the expense of slower tuning
and reduced scan-to-scan repeatability. Both tuning architectures
can provide narrow linewidth emission (<5 MHz), suitable for the
LAS techniques discussed previously. QCLs are now available for a
wide range of wavelengths from multiple vendors (e.g., Alpes,
Adtech, Daylight Solutions, Hamamatsu, Pranalytica).

P6.2.2. Interband cascade lasers (ICLs)

PICLs leverage interband transitions and electron-hole recombina-
tion similar to a diode, but also use a layered heterogeneous band-
structure to achieve cascading of photon emission similar to a QCL.
As such, ICLs may be viewed as a hybrid of conventional diode lasers
and quantum cascade lasers. The use of interband transitions (as
opposed to intersubband transitions) allows for lower electrical
input powers compared to QCLs, but also yields a more narrow range
of wavelengths over which lasing can be achieved at room tempera-
ture ((cid:1)2.9 to 5.7 m m) [243]. Invented around the same time as the
QCL was demonstrated [244], the first continuous wave ICL was
demonstrated in 2008 [245]. Subsequent advancements in tuning
response and efficiency [246,247] have enabled commercially avail-
able, compact, narrowband DFB ICL lasers that fill a gap ((cid:1)3 to
4 mm) in the mid-wave infrared between conventional room-tem-
perature diodes and quantum-cascade lasers. This region is espe-
cially important to combustion due to the very strong C-H stretch
vibrational mode common to all hydrocarbons near 3.4 mm.

P6.2.3. Optical fibers

PSince conventional silica-based fibers do not transmit light
beyond (cid:1) 2.3 mm, alternatives are required for the mid-IR. Fiber
materials for the mid-infrared are more expensive, generally less
robust mechanically, and have higher attenuation, thus limiting the
length that is acceptable for meaningful transmission levels. How-
ever, bend and injection losses are often more important than trans-
mission loss for the relatively short fiber length (<100 m) needed to
remotely locate combustion sensors. With increasing demand for
mid-IR fibers, a number of materials have matured commercially in
the last fifteen years or so [248,249]. At present, several types of
mid-infrared fibers are available for use in harsh environments.
Fig. 16 highlights some of these fiber materials and their respective
transmission spectra in the infrared. Two of the more attractive fiber
types are fluoride glasses (ZBLAN and InF3) and hollow-core wave-
guides. Both fiber types are mechanically more robust than chalco-
genide, which is known to be brittle [250] and together offer
transmission across a broad wavelength range from (cid:1)2 to 12 mm.
The fluoride glass fibers offer lower attenuation than the hollow-
core waveguides in the 2 to 5 mm wavelength domain and are avail-
able in greater lengths (>5 m). The fluoride glass fibers are also
available as single-mode and were successfully utilized for multiple
projects highlighted in this paper (for example see Section 13.1). The
hollow-core waveguides offer transmission over a broader wave-
length range compared to the fluoride glasses and also typically
come in larger diameters for ease of coupling which is especially

Pneeded for non-Gaussian beams. Additionally, because there is no
solid core to the fiber, there is less risk of spurious back reflections
that often occur during fiber coupling and lead to wavelength and
intensity jitter. The hollow-core fibers do tend to induce substantial
light attenuation when bent and may require purging to avoid
absorption due to ambient CO2 and H2O.

P6.2.4. Detectors

(InSb)

PIndium-antimonide

and mercury-cadmium-telluride
(HgCdTe or MCT) are the most common semiconductor materials
used for mid-infrared detectors. These detectors are available in
both photoconductive and photovoltaic operation modes. In the for-
mer, the electrical resistance is influenced by the incident photons
and, in the latter, current is generated by the photoelectric effect.
For these mid-IR materials, photovoltaic operation is typically pre-
ferred due to its lower dark current. InSb photovoltaic detectors are
sensitive from (cid:1)1 to 5.5 mm and must operate at cryogenic tempera-
tures ((cid:1)80 K); they are typically packaged with a dewar for liquid-
nitrogen cooling. MCT detectors (photovoltaic or photoconductive)
can be sufficiently cooled thermo-electrically providing for a more
portable and less cumbersome package that can be mounted at any
orientation, which is useful for engine sensing applications. The
amount of cadmium in the MCT alloy can be chosen to tune the sen-
sitive wavelength region within a broad range of (cid:1)2(cid:3)15 mm. How-
ever, it is worth noting that the dark current rises when tuning the
MCT’s responsivity to longer wavelengths. For the mid-wave IR
(3(cid:3)5 mm), InSb detectors tend to outperform MCT with regards to
signal-to-noise ratio, but advances in multi-stage thermo-electric
cooling schemes have reduced this advantage. It should be noted
that both IR detector materials are susceptible to spatially non-uni-
form response in the active region. Selection of an appropriate mid-
IR detector involves a tradeoff in size/area, sensitivity, and band-
width requirements for a given application.

P6.2.5. Optical materials

PTable 3 lists a number of common optical materials (frequently
used as windows) that transmit in the infrared. Quartz, or fused sil-
ica (SiO2), is the most common and inexpensive optical material, but
it only transmits up to (cid:1)3.5 mm, thus it is not suitable for sensing in

Pmost of the mid-infrared. Sapphire (Al2O3) is an excellent material
for harsh environments due to its superior strength and high melting
point, which makes it suitable for most high-pressure combustion
applications. Sapphire also has relatively high thermal conductivity
and low thermal expansion, making the material highly resistant to
thermal shock. For many cases, sapphire is the ideal material selec-
tion for optical ports/windows in high-temperature gas flows. How-
ever, sapphire transmission degrades around 5 mm and the
transmission cutoff has a strong temperature dependence. This
should be considered when designing an LAS sensor for CO2
((cid:1)4.3 mm), CO ((cid:1)4.8 mm), or NO ((cid:1)5.2 mm) at high temperatures.
An empirical model of the temperature-dependent transmission of
sapphire was developed by Thomas et al. [251], and results are
shown in Fig. 17 for a temperature range of 300 to 2100 K with a
window thickness of 1 cm. If probing a wavelength in the (cid:1)3.5 to
6 mm domain, it is important to understand that time-varying trans-
mission may occur (e.g., during thermal transients) if using the diag-
nostic in a high-temperature system.

crystals become

relatively hygroscopic

PTransmission cutoffs aside, quartz and sapphire are the best
infrared materials for spectroscopic windows on harsh combus-
tion systems and should be used when feasible. Other classes of
mid-infrared optical materials are less robust than quartz or sap-
phire but may be needed for transmission beyond 5 mm. The
fluoride crystals including BaF2, CaF2, and MgF2 have broad
transmission from the ultra-violet up to 12 mm (in the case of
BaF2) and low indices of refraction (nrefractive) which helps miti-
gate back reflections and etalons, but they are somewhat weak
and highly susceptible to thermal shock due to their large ther-
mal expansion coefficients. Furthermore, when heated the fluo-
ride
and are not
recommended for use in moist environments above 800 K. Zinc
Selenide (ZnSe) and Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) offer even broader trans-
mission into the far-infrared (up to 20 mm). They are a bit stron-
ger than the fluoride crystals, and offer greater resistance to
thermal shock, but are relatively brittle. Perhaps most problem-
atic for high-temperature applications, these zinc materials oxi-
dize above 500 K. The surface reaction issues with both the
fluoride and zinc optical materials may be resolved with high-
temperature coatings. Germanium and Silicon are also good
infrared optical materials at room temperature, but these materi-
als rapidly become opaque as temperature is elevated [252]. It
should be noted that for shock tube applications, the windows
are only exposed to a high temperature gas for a very short time
period (order of ms), thus many of these temperature-dependent
issues are less important, since minimal heat transfer occurs dur-
ing that time.

6.3. Emerging sources

PThis section will discuss several novel light sources and/or tech-
niques that have recently been developed and demonstrated in IR-
LAS sensors. These methods have been shown to offer improvements
in measurement rate, spectral bandwidth, and measurement fidelity.

P6.3.1. Chirped QCLs

PWhile chirped quantum-cascade laser absorption (QCLAS) is not
particularly new [253,254], and others have applied it to study com-
bustion gases [255], Chrystie et al. [256] recently demonstrated the
first use of a chirped-QCL (near 7.62 mm) for measurements of H2O
and temperature at rates as high as 3.125 and 0.25 MHz, respec-
tively. The authors demonstrated this technique with measurements
acquired in a static cell at known conditions and behind reflected
shock waves in a reacting gas, thereby demonstrating the utility of
this method for studying highly transient combustion processes (e.
g., chemical kinetics). The ability to acquire calibration-free species
and temperature measurements at MHz (or near) rates that employ
wavelength tuning for increased robustness represents a significant
advancement. This achievement has the potential
for offering
improved understanding of a variety of highly-transient combustion
processes.

PThis technique operates by pulsing a QCL’s current with a high-
frequency, long-duration squarewave which, within the pulse, rap-
idly increases the temperature of the laser causing its wavelength to
vary (i.e., chirp). In LAS applications, the pulse duration and ampli-
tude are specified such that the laser’s wavelength chirps (i.e., tunes)
across an absorption transition analogous to scanned-wavelength
direct-absorption experiments. In this method, a primary concern is
the chirp-induced broadening of the laser linewidth. The greater the
chirp rate, the greater the instantaneous linewidth and the lower
the resolution. The work reported in [256] exhibited chirp rates
from 20 to 60 MHz/ns yielding spectral resolutions of 0.013 to
0.021 cm¡1 and was ultimately the limiting factor preventing faster
thermometry measurements (since a greater chirp rate is needed to
scan across two transitions). These concepts are illustrated in Fig. 18.

P6.3.2. Frequency comb spectrometers

PFrequency combs are an emerging class of lasers that simul-
taneously emit a multitude of evenly spaced individual wave-
length elements (i.e., comb teeth). Recently, Rieker et al. [135]
used a dual-comb spectrometer (DCS) to measure gas tempera-
ture, H2O, HDO, CO2, 13CO2, and CH4 simultaneously across a
2 km open path through the turbulent atmosphere. The DCS
spanned 1600 to 1670 nm with 80,000 comb teeth and a tooth
spacing of 100 MHz. The authors reported one-sigma variations
of <1 ppm for CO2 and <3 ppb for CH4 after 5 min of signal
averaging, and absorbance noise levels of 5 £ 10¡4 over longer
averages.

PThe operating principles of DCS are shown in Fig. 19 (taken from
[135]). In DCS, two frequency combs with teeth at optical frequen-
cies (i.e., in the THz regime) are locked together with a fixed offset
(Dfr) in their repetition rate (fr). These combs are combined together
to create a rf-comb (via heterodyning) where each tooth (in the MHz
regime) exhibits a one-to-one relationship with its corresponding
pair of THz teeth that are attenuated according to Beer’s Law and the
absorbance spectrum of each chemical species in the test gas. The
measured detector signal therefore yields an interferogram which
can be processed to yield a measured transmission and absorption
spectrum.

PDCS offers a number of unique capabilities including broad spec-
tral coverage (e.g., 5990 to 6260 cm¡1 in [135]), ultra-narrow line-
width (order 1 Hz per comb tooth), and precisely known absolute
wavelength (frequency of each tooth known to better than 1 kHz).
for high-fidelity
These attributes make DCS an ideal

tool

Pmeasurements of molecular spectra and are in stark contrast to sev-
eral other hyperspectral sources (e.g., FDML, Supercontinuum) that
exhibit comparatively broad linewidths (on the order of 0.1 cm¡1) or
lack wavelength stability (e.g., external cavity quantum-cascade
lasers). These benefits, however, currently come with the require-
ment to average many pulses which reduces the ultimate measure-
ment rate. Regardless, it is clear that DCS-based sensors offer great
potential to expand the measurement capabilities offered by more
established IR-LAS technologies.

PDuring the compilation of this manuscript, Schroeder et al. [257]
presented the first use of a DCS sensor in an industrial environment.
The authors presented measurements of temperature, H2O, and CO2
at 0.1 Hz in the exhaust of a 16 MW gas turbine, thereby demonstrat-
ing the potential of this technology to be applied to a wide range of
practical combustion systems. In addition, it should be noted that
other methods for comb spectroscopy exist that rely on traditional
grating-based spectrometers or Fourier transform spectrometers.
This technique was recently used to measure H2O in a laboratory
flat-flame burner [153].

6.4. Compact sensors

PThe need to characterize combustion systems with limited opti-
cal access has driven the development of numerous compact LAS
sensors [42,177,202,206,212,258(cid:3)266] and the majority of these
sensors have leveraged robust telecommunication-grade optical
hardware. Specifically, Wehe et al. [258,259] embedded a diode-
laser-based sensor into a probe for gas temperature, velocity, and
H2O in hypervelocity flows, Schultz et al. [262] and Strand and Han-
son [263] developed fiber-coupled sensor packages for model scram-
jets housed in vacuum chambers, Ebert et al. [266] and Whitney

Pet al. [206] developed compact arrangements for providing line-of-
sight access in IC engines, and Caswell et al. [212] developed a fiber-
optic package providing counter-propagating beams for facilitating
velocimetry sensing. While the aforementioned examples are cer-
tainly compact compared to other laser-diagnostic techniques (e.g.,
PLIF, CARS), this section will highlight only the most compact sen-
sors, specifically, single-ended LAS sensors.

P6.4.1. Probe-based single-ended sensors

PSeveral researchers have developed single-ended probes for
studying IC-engines via IR-LAS [42,260,261,267(cid:3)269]. Hall and Koe-
nig [267] were the first to implement IR fibers into a spark-plug
probe (similar to that shown in Fig. 20) for delivering and receiving
IR light. The authors used a broadband IR source to monitor the
absorption of fuel from 3.3 to 3.5 mm, thereby enabling monitoring
of the fuel-air ratio near the spark plug. A similar configuration and
diagnostic technique was more recently used by Cundy et al. [269].
Tomita et al. [268] used a similar probe design, but used two sap-
phire rods cleaved at 45° to direct light in and out of the engine and
used a HeNe near 3.39 mm to monitor fuel absorption. More
recently, Rieker et al. [42] integrated a fiber-coupled WMS-2f/1f-
based TDLAS sensor into a spark plug and demonstrated crank-angle
resolved measurements of temperature and H2O concentration in
motored and fired tests. The sensor used a SMF to pitch laser light

Pnear 1.4 mm across a 6 mm gap and a small mirror was used to
reflect light back towards a multi-mode catch fiber (see Fig. 20). Jef-
fries et al. [260] later used a similar probe for crank-angle-resolved
mid-IR measurements of gasoline. The authors used a fiber-coupled
DFG technique to generate two colors near 2951 and 2970 cm¡1 for
exploiting the strong C-H stretch absorption band for high-sensitiv-
ity measurements of gas temperature and gasoline concentration.
The injection current of each pump laser was modulated at a unique
frequency to enable frequency-multiplexing and demultiplexing of
each color with a sensor bandwidth of 10 kHz. The WMS-1f signal of
each laser was then extracted via post-processing using digital lock-
in amplifiers and the two-color ratio of WMS-1f signals was used to
calculate temperature analogous to as done in fixed-wavelength
direct-absorption techniques. Details regarding the development of
this sensor can be found in [218] and quantitative measurements of
gasoline were enabled via a spectroscopic model developed by
Klingbeil et al. [44]. Fig. 21 illustrates time-resolved measurements
of gasoline concentration acquired at pressures up to 40 atm during
fired operation. Measurements of air-fuel ratio acquired during
operation agreed well with the air-fuel ratios inferred from analysis
of independently acquired exhaust emissions measurements. In

[265].

Paddition, Rein and Sanders [261] also used a similar probe in an IC-
engine, but used a fiber-coupled FTIR spectrometer to measure H2O,
CO2 and temperature. While useful, the primary disadvantage of all
the aforementioned designs is that probes can perturb the local flow
field and heat transfer to the probe surfaces can influence the local
gas temperature and perturb the local chemistry.

P6.4.2. Single-ended sensors using native surfaces

PDue to the intrusive nature of probes, several researchers
have recently developed single-ended LAS sensors relying on
backscattering off native surfaces
(e.g., a combustor wall)
[202,264,265]. Wang and Sanders [264] recently demonstrated a
single-ended near-IR LAS sensor for monitoring H2O near 1.4 mm
with scanned-WMS-2f/1f. They showed that WMS-2f/1f with f D
100 kHz was able to reject speckle noise and demonstrated accu-
rate measurements off a rough moving surface indicating a simi-
lar sensor package could be deployed in an engine/combustor
with moving parts. Goldenstein et al. [265] developed a single-
ended, fiber-coupled near-IR diode-laser sensor for stand-off
measurements of gas temperature, pressure, and composition
using scanned-WMS-2f/1f. This sensor employed a fiber-bundle
with 6 multi-mode catch fibers surrounding a single single-mode
pitch fiber housed in a 25.4 mm diameter lens tube. This config-
uration was shown to provide collection efficiencies (fraction of
incident photons collected) from 1 to 104 parts-per-million at
stand-off distances from 10 m to 10 cm, respectively. The sensor
was demonstrated with measurements of temperature, pressure,
and H2O in a flame at a stand-off distance of 15 cm and CH4
at a stand-off distance of 10 m. Diode lasers near 1.4 mm and
1.65 mm were used to interrogate H2O and CH4 transitions,
respectively. A schematic showing the sensor package is shown
in Fig. 22. Most recently, Rein et al. [202] deployed a single-
ended, fiber-coupled MEMS VCSEL sensor operating near 1.4 mm
for measurements of temperature and H2O at 100 kHz in a rotat-
ing-detonation combustor (RDC). This sensor utilized a single-
mode pitch fiber and multi-mode catch fiber housed side-by-side
in the fiber bundle developed by Caswell et al. [212] (see Fig. 23)
to transmit and receive laser light reflected off the RDC center-
body. A single lens was used to collimate the incident light and
collect the backscattered light after traversing 1.52 cm (round
trip) through the test gas.

PDuring the revision of this manuscript, Peng et al. [270] presented
the first demonstration of single-ended mid-IR sensing of combus-
tion gases. The authors utilized a hollow-core fiber bundle to deliver
mid-IR laser light near 2.5, 4.2, and 4.8 mm to a test article, and used
a cage-system-based optical package (capable of being mounted

Pdirectly to an engine) to collect and demultiplex the backscattered
laser light onto two detectors. This sensor was demonstrated with
simultaneous time-resolved measurements of temperature, H2O,
CO, and CO2 in a laboratory flame.

7. Sensor-design process

PThe design of modern IR-LAS sensors for combustion systems is a
complex process with many factors to consider. While much of this
complexity results from the need to overcome fundamental mea-
surement challenges (discussed in Section 5) within the constraints
of a specific problem, some of it arises from the immense freedom
today’s researchers have when designing such a sensor. In all cases,
the sensor-design process is immediately constrained by the mea-
surement needs for the application/problem of interest, and many
excellent papers have been devoted to describing the design process
of a given tailor-made sensor (see manuscripts highlighted in the
following sections). That said, the goal of this section is merely to
put forth a high-level roadmap for guiding the design of an IR-LAS
sensor for a general combustion application/problem.

7.1. Identify measurement needs and challenges

PThe sensor-design process should always begin by identifying the
measurement needs and challenges. The former of these is the most
obvious, as it is typically set by the sponsor or question driving the
research. The measurement needs for a given application typically

Pdefine: (1) the range of thermodynamic conditions and species con-
centrations of interest, (2) the measurement bandwidth needed to
resolve the transients of interest, (3) the optical path length, and (4)
environmental factors. The measurement challenges can be harder
to identify; however, common challenges are: (1) achieving optimal
absorbance levels and temperature sensitivity, (2) avoiding interfer-
ing absorption and emission, (3) using techniques and spectroscopic
models that accurately account for collisional broadening, (4) using
methods that are insensitive to or, account for, line-of-sight non-
uniformities (if present), and (5) using diagnostic techniques and
optical assemblies that are insensitive to beam steering and non-res-
onant transmission losses. Solutions to these problems are continu-
ally evolving; however, Section 5 discusses several state-of-the-art
solutions to the aforementioned problems and others. Many of these
solutions rely on intelligent selection of wavelengths, hardware, and
IR-LAS technique; the general approach to each is discussed next.

7.2. Selection of wavelength, hardware, and LAS technique

PWith the measurement needs and challenges understood, the
next step should be to identify the wavelength(s) that are optimal
for the application and measurements of interest. The primary goal
should be to identify wavelengths that provide optimal absorbance
levels ((cid:1)0.1 to 3) while maintaining sensitivity to the measurement
targets (e.g., temperature) and avoiding interfering absorption. At
pressures where individual transitions can be easily resolved, this is
a relatively straightforward process (e.g., see [221]) and robust single
line-of-sight solutions have even been developed to account for pro-
nounced line-of-sight non-uniformities (see Section 5.1.1). More
complicated wavelength-selection routines are more appropriate
when the spectra-of-interest are significantly blended (e.g., at high
pressures) and/or hyperspectral sources are used (see Section 5.3).

PDuring the wavelength-selection process one must simulta-
neously consider the ramifications associated with working in differ-
ent spectral regions. Perhaps most importantly, one must realize
that the capabilities and limitations of light sources, fibers, and
detectors can vary greatly throughout the near-IR, let alone the
entire IR. For example, while injection-current tunable DFB TDLs,
ICLs, and QCLs are now readily available from (cid:1)0.8 to 16 mm, their
tuning abilities, optical powers, and stability vary significantly. Fur-
ther, the current capabilities of optical fiber vary greatly with wave-
length and, in general, become less robust and more inefficient
when going deeper into the IR. These differences alone may
render the optimal wavelength region inaccessible for a given
application or problem. These issues and others are discussed in
detail in Section 6.

PFurther complicating matters, the light sources and, perhaps,
detectors that are suitable for a given wavelength region are likely
not compatible with all IR-LAS techniques. For example, hyperspec-
tral sources are currently not readily available in the mid-IR which
currently limits these techniques to species with strong near-IR
absorption bands and/or in applications with relatively large path
lengths. In contrast, lasers suitable for scanned-DA and WMS (e.g.,
DFB or external cavity TDLs, VCSELs, ICLs, and QCLs) are currently
available throughout the majority of the IR, making these techniques
widely applicable. That being said, in the vast majority of hostile
combustion applications we elect to use WMS-2f/1f techniques due
to its noise rejection benefits and insensitivity to non-absorbing
transmission losses; however, in cases with large SNR, scanned-DA
remains an attractive technique due to its reduced complexity. In
the near-IR, WMS-2f/1f and hyperspectral absorption have repeat-
edly demonstrated the ability to provide high-fidelity measurements
in a wide range of harsh combustion systems (e.g., power plants,
detonation combustors etc.), many of which are highlighted in the
sections that follow. As a result, in this wavelength region choosing
between these two methods is largely a question of personal

Ppreference and expertise. However, if sensor cost and longevity are a
concern, WMS-based sensors employing telecommunication-grade
TDLs are currently a better option in this regard.

PIn short, the design of virtually all IR-LAS sensors involves a vari-
ety of trade-offs and a silver-bullet solution does not currently exist.
As light sources and optical components continue to evolve, so will
the choice of sensors that are optimal for a given application and
problem. The remainder of this manuscript will highlight recent
works that advanced the current state of IR-LAS sensing in combus-
tion applications.

8. Sensors for fundamental combustion chemistry studies

PHere we begin our review of recent applications of IR-LAS for
studying combustion gases with an overview of sensors used for
investigating combustion chemistry. These systems include various
flame apparatuses as well as shock tubes, where the primary goal is
the determination of fundamental rate constants or insights about
reaction pathways that describe the kinetic behavior of fuels or fuel
byproducts.

8.1. Shock tubes

PStudies of chemical kinetics in shock tubes have driven the devel-
opment of a wide range of IR-LAS sensors. Shock tubes provide
exceptionally uniform properties along the line-of-sight and are rel-
atively quiescent (compared to most combustion flows), providing
ideal conditions for high-fidelity time-resolved LAS measurements
of species and gas properties. In reciprocity, species time histories,
especially those with multiple time-scales, place internal constraints
on combustion kinetics models that are more rigid than global
parameters such as ignition delay times, and have led to significant
advances in the modeling of combustion chemistry [271]. As such,
the application of infrared LAS in the context of shock tube kinetics
has a rich history that has been discussed in other review papers,
including the recent paper by Hanson and Davidson [127]. Here we
highlight only very recent works in order to identify emerging areas
in IR-LAS for combustion. Several of these works were first devel-
oped and demonstrated on shock tubes prior to utilization in other
environments.

P8.1.1. Thermometry

PIn chemical-kinetics studies, accurate knowledge of temperature
is critical for the determination of rate constants due to their expo-
nential temperature dependence described by the Arrhenius equa-
tion. In shock tubes, test temperature can be well-defined ((cid:1)1%
uncertainty) by the measurement of incident shock velocity and uti-
lization of the normal-shock relations. However, in experiments
with transient temperature, only the initial value is well known by
this method, and there are also cases where temperature measure-
ments better than 1% uncertainty are desired as temperature may
still be the largest uncertainty factor when propagated to a mea-
sured rate constant. Given the relative importance of temperature, a
number of efforts over the past ten years have been dedicated to
providing a sensitive LAS-based thermometer for shock-tube stud-
ies. Several nascent combustion species (e.g., H2O, CO, NO and CO2)
that are infrared active have been investigated for two-color ther-
mometry, with reported uncertainties ((cid:1)1%) that are competitive
with the conventional approach while also providing time-resolved
data for transients [105,272,273].

PH2O and CO2 have received perhaps the most attention for shock
tube thermometry, being relatively chemically inert and major com-
bustion products that can also be seeded into an initial reactant mix-
ture. The mid-infrared spectra, and recent advances in laser
technology in this domain, has enabled notable progress in the
development of LAS sensors interrogating these species. Farooq et al.

P[102,274] and Ren et al. [275] utilized the CO2 spectra near 2.7 mm
for temperature sensing behind reflected shock waves using two-
color wavelength-modulation spectroscopy. Spearrin et al. [103,276]
later introduced a cross-band thermometry technique for CO2 that
leverages the inverse temperature dependence of two lines from the
2.7 mm and 4.2 mm vibrational bands, respectively, for enhanced
sensitivity and a broader temperature range. Recent efforts for H2O
intra-pulse chirp
thermometry include a pulsed-scanning, or
method, developed by Chrystie et al. [256] to resolve H2O lineshapes
near 7.6 mm as already discussed in Section 6.3. It is worth noting
that Uddi et al. [277] used a QCL near 7.6 mm to measure H2O and
temperature at up to 20 bar in a rapid-compression machine; how-
ever, this work employed scanned-wavelength direct absorption
with much lower time resolution (200 Hz). Campbell et al. [276] has
further shown that scanned-WMS may be used for partially-resolv-
ing H2O lineshapes while still temporally-resolving temperature
transients behind reflected shock waves. Though both species (CO2
and H2O) are very useful, CO2 does not readily adsorb to surfaces
and has a much higher vapor pressure, making it easier to seed into
a gas mixture.

Ppyrolysis and oxidation studies in shock tubes [278,279]. Similarly,
the carbon dioxide gas laser ((cid:1)10.6 mm) has been used for ethylene
measurements at pressures higher than 50 atm [279(cid:3)281]. Often,
these two gas lasers are used simultaneously to observe larger
hydrocarbons decomposing into smaller hydrocarbons (e.g., ethyl-
ene). Semiconductor diode and quantum-cascade lasers have
enabled the detection of several other combustion species at ele-
vated pressures. Farooq et al. [217] demonstrated WMS of CO2 near
2.7 mm above 10 atm during heptane oxidation in a shock tube.
Most recently, Spearrin et al. [101,106] and Goldenstein et al.
[203,210] used these tunable sources for acquiring measurements of
CO2, CO, H2O, and temperature at pressures up to (cid:1)50 atm in a shock
tube, and later applied these sensors to a pulsed-detonation com-
bustor [237]. For thermometry in high-enthalpy air, Spearrin et al.
[115] validated and demonstrated a sensor based on NO detection at
pressures up to (cid:1)150 atm in a shock tube using a quantum-cascade
laser near 5.2 mm [115]. This sensor inferred the temperature by
comparing the measured concentration of NO to that given by tem-
perature-dependent
equilibrium calculations;
example results are shown in Fig. 24.

P8.1.2. High-pressure studies and sensor development

P8.1.3. Fuel intermediates

PSpecies sensing at high pressures is another important capability
for shock tube studies (as well as other combustion experiments) as
most practical combustion devices operate at tens or hundreds of
atmospheres, and there is a need for improving our understanding
of kinetic behavior in this domain. LAS is inherently more challeng-
ing to implement at elevated pressures due to lineshape broadening
and the associated blending of many spectral lines that complicate
the interpretation of an absorption measurement, not to mention
the practical challenges of increased beam steering and boundary
layer effects. It can be quite challenging to validate absorption mod-
els (a prerequisite for quantitative LAS) at high-pressure and high-
temperature conditions as creating a controlled, well-known envi-
ronment at these extremes is difficult. Shock tubes serve an impor-
tant role in this regard since temperature and pressure can be
known quite well behind the reflected shockwave (albeit for short
time) in a non-reactive experiment. Further, the impulsive nature of
the experiment also lends to greater safety than static or steady-
flow experiments since the extreme conditions behind the reflected
shock typically only lasts a few milliseconds. Shock tubes have
played an important role in the development of high-pressure infra-
red LAS diagnostics in recent years, in addition to facilitating kinetics
studies. Here we identify a few notable works that extend measure-
ment capabilities to pressures above 10 atm.

PThe helium-neon gas laser near 3.39 mm has been used for fixed-
wavelength LAS measurements of numerous hydrocarbons for fuel

PAt high temperatures, large hydrocarbon fuels breakdown into
smaller intermediate species. Time-histories of fuel intermediates
during combustion typically occur on at least two time-scales: for-
mation and decomposition. Multiple time scales provide more rigid
constraints for kinetic modeling which makes these species, similar
to other intermediates like OH and CO, high-value targets in shock
tube studies. Unfortunately, most hydrocarbons have been histori-
cally inaccessible in the infrared due to gaps in wavelength coverage
for semiconductor lasers despite the strong fundamental vibrational
bands such as C-H stretch ((cid:1)3 mm) and C-H bend ((cid:1)10(cid:3)12 mm) that
are shared by many important combustion species. Gas lasers such
as the HeNe and CO2 lasers have enabled some species sensing in
this domain, but the lack of continuous tuning capability and usual
interference associated with a mixture of hydrocarbons has limited
the expansion of these LAS methods beyond a few species. Fortu-
nately, the emergence of interband and quantum cascade lasers over
the past fifteen years has removed this constraint, providing near
continuous wavelength coverage from the near to far infrared
((cid:1)1(cid:3)15 mm) via tunable, room-temperature, coherent light sources.
Correspondingly, this has led to many new sensors for fuel inter-
mediates.

PAs mentioned previously, early work in the detection of fuel
intermediates for shock tube kinetics studies focused on ethylene
due to its importance and abundance in large alkane decomposition
pathways and accessibility with a CO2 gas laser near 10.6 mm

P[111,281]. This was followed by efforts that utilized difference fre-
quency generation (DFG) lasers to target methane [282] and formal-
ydehyde [283] in the 3.4 to 3.6 mm region. Improved methods for
methane detection with regards to interference in combustion gases
have more recently been developed by Sur et al. [110] using an inter-
band cascade laser near 3.2 mm and Sajid et al. [109,284] using a
quantum-cascade laser near 8 mm. Similarly, interband and quan-
tum cascade lasers have helped expand the list of fuel intermediates
measureable in shock tubes to include acetylene [285,286], propene
[113], and isobutene [114].

P8.1.4. Cavity-enhanced studies

PAs discussed in Section 4.4, optical cavities can be used to
improve the sensitivity of an LAS measurement by increasing the
distance over which light interacts with the absorbing species.
Increased sensitivity in the detection of a given gas species facilitates
improved shock tube experiments in two primary ways. First,
experiments may be more highly diluted with an inert bath gas such
that the test time involves dampened transients of temperature and
pressure when reaction occurs. Dampened transients, especially
temperature, reduce experimental uncertainties. Second, enhanced
sensitivity allows for the detection of certain species that may have
been considered infeasible over the typical inner diameter of a shock
tube ((cid:1)10 cm).

PSeveral variations of cavity-enhanced absorption have been
deployed in shock tubes. Sun et al. has demonstrated low-finesse,
off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy for carbon monoxide
[159] and acetylene [160] detection in the infrared. Fig. 25 shows
the formation of CO from the thermal decomposition of only 10 ppm
acetone, thereby highlighting the ability of CEAS to provide high-
fidelity species time histories in highly dilute gases. With a cavity-
enhanced absorption gain factor of 91, a detection limit of (cid:1)100 ppb
of CO was achieved at combustion temperatures using a DFB-QCL
near 4.6 mm. Later, Nations et al. [287] used a similar approach to
study the formation of excited O-atoms (via low-lying electronic
transitions in the IR near 800 nm) behind reflected shock waves at
extreme temperatures (5000(cid:3)8000 K). Additionally, Alquaity et al.
[288] utilized a pulsed QCL near 10.6 micron in a cavity-ringdown
spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of ethylene.
Both of these techniques involve replacing the shock tube windows
with mirrors that are partially transmissive. Another technique,
intra-cavity absorption spectroscopy, does not require high reflectiv-
ity mirrors but rather involves gas detection within the cavity of
a broadband laser. Fjodorow et al. recently demonstrated this
approach to measure acetylene near 1.5 mm in a shock tube using a
home-made erbium fiber laser [289].

Fig. 25. Formation of CO (red) measured via CEAS during thermal decomposition of
acetone behind a reflected shock wave. Figure adapted from [159]. (Please consult the
web version of this article to clarify the references to color within the legend.)

PAll of these cavity-enhanced techniques require more complex
alignment than conventional LAS and take advantage of the rela-
tively quiescent environment behind a reflected shock wave. As
such, their extension to more harsh combustion conditions has
promise, but comes with additional practical challenges.

8.2. Laboratory flames

PLaboratory flames, ranging from low-pressure flat-flame burners
to high-pressure flow reactors, are used for the study of combustion
chemistry primarily by assessing the variation of species and gas
properties in space (along the axis of flow), as opposed to time for
shock tubes. Historically, species measurements in flames have typi-
cally been acquired using gas chromatography (GC) and mass spec-
trometry (MS) methods coupled with sampling probes. A number of
chemistry studies using low-pressure burners have also leveraged
ultraviolet laser absorption and fluorescence measurement techni-
ques, but the implementation of IR-LAS has been sparse. A few
recent efforts are discussed here.

PSimilar to shock tube studies, temperature is a critical parameter
for interpreting the chemistry governing flames. Li et al. [290] intro-
duced an H2O two-line thermometry technique near 2.9 mm for
low-pressure flames and demonstrated this with measurements of
spatially resolved temperature and H2O concentration in methane-
fueled flames. To minimize the influence of line-of-sight non-unifor-
mities, sapphire rods were used to direct the light across a relatively
uniform portion of the flame. Smith et al. [177] improved upon this
thermometry technique by implementing scanned-WMS spectral
fitting and by using two sapphire rods cleaved at 45° to direct light
in and out of the flame.

PAround the same time, several efforts were conducted to mea-
sure C2H2 and CO in flames via scanned-wavelength direct absorp-
tion. Measurements of C2H2 concentration were acquired in both
diffusion [291] and laminar flames [292] using a TDL near 1.53 mm,
while CO was measured in a counter-flow diffusion flame using a
TDL near 2.3 mm. Measurements were acquired at multiple positions
to resolve 1D distributions of each species. More recently, Nau et al.
[293] used a quantum cascade laser near 4.5 mm to measure CO,
CO2, and temperature in 2D (via tomography) in fuel-rich methane
flames. Girard et al. [294] further utilized an interband cascade laser
to measure CO2 and temperature near 4.2 mm in low-pressure meth-
ane and ethylene flames over both fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions.
In addition to these studies, which provided insight into 1D-chemis-
try models, many other IR-LAS sensors have simply been demon-
strated in flames. Such demonstrations have been omitted from this
section.

9. Sensors for power plants and gasifiers

PLAS-based measurements are frequently needed to characterize
the behavior of industrial-scale combustion systems since their
harsh and often corrosive environment complicates the use of intru-
sive sensors (e.g., thermocouples, sampling probes). As such, there is
a long history of IR-LAS for such systems. To our knowledge, the ear-
liest TDLAS measurements in a large-scale industrial combustor
were conducted by Ebert et al. [296] who measured the concentra-
tion of O2 and H2O in a waste incinerator. This work was followed by
TDLAS measurements of O2, CH4, CO2, and H2O in a natural-gas fired
power plant [297] and CO and H2O in a coal-fired power plant [298].
Ebert et al. [299] later used a TDL near 2.3 mm to provide more sensi-
tive measurements of CO in a 3.5 MW waste incinerator and, more
recently, Ortwein et al. [300] used a VCSEL near 1.74 mm to measure
HCl in a gasification process stream. TDLAS sensors for such systems
are maturing and Zolo Technology currently provides a commercial
sensor for H2O, CO, O2, and CO2 along multiple paths, enabling tomo-
graphic reconstruction of the distribution of combustion products

Pand gas temperature [301]. More recently, measurements of NO and
CO were acquired in the exhaust of coal-fired boilers [302,303].
These works discussed and illustrated many of the difficulties of field
measurements in industrial-scale combustion applications. For
example, combustion-driven power plants and glass furnaces oper-
ate continuously for months (or even years) precluding any opportu-
nity to install new window ports or change engineering designs.
Again, when the large-scale combustor is heated to operating tem-
peratures, the entire assembly (fire-box, boiler, exhaust ducts) all
move significant distances by thermal expansion, and the firewalls
were not designed to be mechanically stable requiring at least
remotely driven beam alignment and at best an auto-alignment
arrangement. Since much of this early work has already been
reviewed [2,304], now we will direct our focus to more recent work
done in coal-fired power plants and gasifiers.

9.1. Large non-resonant transmission losses

PThe biggest challenge for LAS sensing in coal-fired systems is to
overcome the large non-resonant transmission losses resulting from
the heavy loading of particulates (e.g., soot, coal dust, ash). Recently,
Sun et al. [305] demonstrated that this challenge could be overcome
using WMS-2f/1f which enables calibration-free measurements
despite unknown levels of non-resonant extinction (as discussed in
Section 4.3 and 5.2). The authors demonstrated measurements of
temperature and H2O in a university-scale coal gasifier despite los-
ing 99.99% of the laser light to particulate scattering.

9.2. Collisional broadening in gases with unknown composition

PAnother challenge complicating LAS measurements in gasifiers is
their high-operating pressures (20 to 50 atm) and the widely vari-
able composition of the product gas. This severely complicates the
modeling of absorption spectra and, therefore, quantitative interpre-
tation of WMS-2f/1f signals. Recently this challenge was overcome
by Sur et al. [295] by using the scanned-WMS simulation and spec-
tral fitting techniques developed by Sun et al. [138] and Goldenstein
et al. [139]. By determining the line broadening in situ, these meth-
ods enabled quantitative, calibration-free measurements of CO near
2326 nm, CO2 near 2017 nm, CH4 near 2290 nm, and H2O near
1352 nm in the product stream (just downstream of the circulating
fluidized bed reactor as marked on the photo on the left side of
Fig. 26) of an engineering-scale coal gasifier [295] at the National
Carbon Capture Center in Wilsonville, AL. This facility run by the
Southern Company for DoE is meant to explore the feasibility of
commercial-scale coal gasification for power generation. Fig. 26
illustrates the size of the facility including the coal-pulverization

Pplant and the gasifier facility. The TDLAS sensor architecture is illus-
trated on the right side of Fig. 26. The automatic data processing and
the laser control electronics were located 30 m away from the mea-
surement location and the lasers were located within 2 m of the
window ports due to the lack of quality fiber for the extended NIR
wavelengths (2017, 2290, and 2326 nm). Note that higher-quality
optical fiber for this wavelength region is now available that would
now allow the lasers to be located with their control electronics
(30 m from measurement location). Light from the four lasers was
combined into a fiber bundle, collimated in free-space and pitched
from one side of the process pipe to the other. The four lasers were
time-multiplexed to use a single detector and each laser was wave-
length scanned and modulated.

PThe sensor was able to provide time-resolved temperature, CO,
CO2, CH4, and H2O concentration throughout a 54 day campaign
(including a 18-day period of unattended operation) of relatively
stable gasification. Typical results are illustrated in Fig. 27. Note the
oscillations in time observed for the product gas mole fractions.
These unexpected oscillations were correlated with the temperature
in the reactor and were synchronous with the batch feeder for pul-
verized coal injection. The average values of CO, CO2 and CH4 mea-
sured by the laser absorption sensor were in good agreement with
extractive gas chromatography; however, the extractive gas analysis
was delayed by (cid:1)20 min and had a (cid:1)15 min time response due to

Fig. 27. Scanned-WMS-2f/1f measurements of species mole-fractions (CH4, CO2, CO,
and H2O) in the exit flow of a coal gasifier. The measurements shown were acquired
during the sensor’s 39th consecutive day of operation. Also plotted are sampled GC
data for CH4, CO2, and CO, as well as thermocouple measurements of gas temperature
acquired at the gasifier exit. The fluctuations in laser-absorption measurements result
from actual fluctuations in the composition of the gasifier’s product gas. Figure

Pthe transport of the sampled gas and diffusion in the large condition-
ing volume (filtering and drying) before the GC. The delay of the
sampling system required for GC measurements highlights an
advantage of LAS sensing.

PExtractive GC measurements are state-of-the-art monitors for
combustion-driven power plants and industrial scale gasification.
The physical size of these facilities translates into long response
times due to the transit time from the extraction point through the
sample conditioning (drying and particulate filtering) to the GC.
Thus, such sampling systems can provide compliance monitoring for
emissions and/or quality measures of the product gas from a gasifier;
however, these delays are unsuitable for process control. In the
example discussed here, such delays were longer than the fuel-
loader cycle time which suppressed the oscillations in gas composi-
tion that were more clearly captured by the IR-LAS measurements.
The LAS sensors provide the fidelity and time-response needed for
process control, and the use of 1f-normalized WMS provides a robust
defense against transmission losses resulting from time varying par-
ticulate scattering, window fouling, and laser aging. The next steps
in sensor development involve packaging for commercial use and
the development of real time signal analysis software suitable for
use by the plant operation staff.

10. Sensors for gas turbines

PSeveral researchers have developed IR-LAS sensors employing a
variety of light sources and diagnostic techniques for measuring gas
temperature and its non-uniformities, H2O, CO2, and CH4 in gas-
turbine systems. Early work was primarily aimed at characterizing
gas-turbine exhaust, some of which pioneered the development of
sensors for controlling gas turbines. For example, Seitzman and
Scully [168] developed a strategy using a spectrally broad light
source near 2.5 mm for measuring temperature uniformity and H2O
concentration at the exit of gas turbine combustors, and later this
strategy was implemented using diode-laser absorption of three
H2O transitions near 2 mm to provide open-loop control of tempera-
ture non-uniformities at the exit of a stratified methane-air combus-
tor [171]. Regarding TDLAS sensors, Liu et al. [306] developed a
TDLAS sensor for measurements of H2O and temperature via absorp-
tion of two H2O transitions near 1.4 mm. This sensor used time-divi-
sion multiplexing and scanned-wavelength direct absorption, and
was demonstrated in the exhaust of an industrial-scale gas turbine
coupled to a 20 MW electric generator. Data processing was per-
formed in real-time to provide temperature measurements at 3 Hz.
The sensor was validated in controlled static-cell experiments with
an accuracy of 2 to 5 K at temperatures from 350 to 1000 K. Around

Pthe same time, Meyer et al. [307] developed a diode laser-based
mid-IR source using difference-frequency mixing and demonstrated
its use with measurements of CO2 near 4.5 mm in the exhaust of a
liquid-fueled model gas-turbine combustor. The use of mid-infrared
wavelengths enabled the authors to demonstrate a detection limit of
44 ppm at measurement rates up to 10 kHz.

PMore recently, gas-turbine sensing has focused on characterizing
the fuel loading and combustion processes relevant to lean blowout
(LBO), and extending measurements to high-pressure model gas-
turbine combustors. These advancements were facilitated through
the use of WMS and hyperspectral sources, respectively, and this
section will focus on these works. It is also worth noting that hyper-
spectral laser-absorption tomography was recently used to recon-
struct the 2D temperature and H2O concentration field in the
exhaust plane of a General Electric J85 aero-propulsion engine
[183]; however, this work has already been thoroughly reviewed by
Bolshov et al. [7].

10.1. Lean-blowout control

PSeveral WMS-based sensors have been developed for studying
lean-blowout in gas-turbine combustors. Zhou et al. [308] developed
diode-laser-based sensors for real-time (onboard post-processing)
measurements of gas temperature and H2O in a swirl-stabilized
model gas-turbine combustor. Two single-laser sensors were devel-
oped, one near 1.8 mm using scanned-DA and one near 1.4 mm using
WMS-2f. The WMS-based sensor provided measurements of gas
temperature at 2 kHz and demonstrated higher-SNR (compared to
direct absorption) in flowfields with soot or droplet scattering. Later,
Li et al. [309,310] extended the WMS-2f sensor near 1.4 mm to be
the first laser-based sensor for active control of lean-blowout in
swirl-stabilized flames within a model gas-turbine combustor. The
authors found that by monitoring the fractional power contained in
the FFT (of temperature) between 0 and 50 Hz, lean-blowout could
be predicted and prevented using an active control system. This
enabled continuous flame holding at equivalence ratios only 0.03
higher than the LBO condition. Fig. 28 shows a schematic of the
experimental setup used and the power-spectrum of the tempera-
ture time-history as a function of differential equivalence ratio (i.e.,
the difference between the equivalence ratio and the LBO value).

PUsing similar technology, Li et al. [311] later developed a WMS-2f
based TDL sensor for measuring fuel loading using the R(3) line of
CH4 near 1653.7 nm. These measurements enabled determination of
the equivalence ratio of the gas entering a model gas-turbine com-
bustion chamber in real time. By measuring the equivalence ratio in
a modulated fuel experiment, the authors were able to correlate

Pwavelengths to monitor line broadening near the wavelengths for
thermometry, and two non-resonant wavelengths on the extreme
ends of the spectral bandwidth to infer Io. Regarding CH4 sensing, 4
additional wavelengths near 1665 nm were employed to monitor
temperature-sensitive and -insensitive CH4 absorption, pressure
broadening, and inferring Io. By detecting only discrete wavelengths,
a sample rate of only 22 MHz was needed, which is approximately
10 times less than that required by FDML-based sensors of compara-
ble measurement rates. Fiber optics were used to transmit and col-
lect laser light pitched across the combustor inlet and exit and were
intelligently designed to rid the need of user alignment. Time-
resolved measurements of temperature and CH4 at the inlet, and
temperature and H2O at the exit are presented at temperatures up
to 1700 K and a pressure near 10 bar.

11. Sensors for IC engines

PIR-LAS sensors have been used to study and characterize a variety
of IC-engine strategies aimed at improving combustion efficiency
and reducing emissions. These works have primarily focused on
acquiring measurements in circumstances where a path-integrated
measurement is easily understood. For example, measurements
have been acquired across short, controlled paths (e.g., in spark-plug
probes) [42,260,267(cid:3)269]) to provide localized measurements of
gas conditions, as well as to monitor combustion progress in homo-
geneous-charge compression-ignition (HCCI) engines [37,128,227].
However, some 2D measurements of species have been acquired via
laser-absorption tomography [313,314]. While IR-LAS sensing has
been done in optical engines [128,315], this section will focus on
several works which have enabled improved in situ measurements
of temperature and species concentrations in more practical IC-
engine systems. The primary challenge common to all of these works
is the need to obtain robust optical access either in-cylinder and/or
near hot ((cid:1)850 K) engine components. This challenge has recently
been overcome via the use of several novel optical assemblies which,
in several cases, were used in combination with modern light sour-
ces and diagnostic techniques to improve measurement fidelity.

11.1. In-cylinder

PSeveral WMS-based sensors have been used to study production-
grade IC-engines via spark-plug-based probes, and these works have
already been discussed in Sect. 6.4.1 and [42,260]. In comparison to
the works discussed in the remainder of this section, these sensors
were forced to overcome short optical path lengths (5 to 12 mm) in
order to provide time-resolved measurements of gas temperature
and H2O or gasoline mole fraction.

PAround the same time, Kranendonk et al. [37] used an FDML laser
with a linewidth of (cid:1)0.1 nm for measurements of gas temperature in
an HCCI engine at 100 kHz and temperatures and pressures ranging
from 300 to 800 K and 2 to 18 bar. The laser interrogated the H2O
absorption spectrum from 1335 to 1373 nm and the methods pre-
sented in [214] were used to calculate gas properties from the mea-
sured spectra. Optical access was provided through two sapphire
windows located in pressure-transducer ports machined into the
pent-roof combustion chamber. Later, Caswell [227] extended the
use of this FDML laser to simultaneous measurements of temperature
and H2O at up to 2000 K and 30 bar in a fired HCCI engine. Fig. 30
shows sample results indicating an impressive RMS temperature
error of only 5 K which, to the best of our knowledge, still represents
the best precision achieved in IC-engine thermometry. Gas properties
were calculated using the methods described in [133] and the BT2
line list [90]. To overcome the fact that BT2 does not contain colli-
sional-broadening parameters, an algorithm was developed to deter-
mine best-fit broadening coefficients for several spectral windows,
since collisional broadening, for H2O, is highly dependent on the

model gas-turbine combustor and example results during a modulated-fuel experi-
ment. Figures adapted from [311].

Poscillations in equivalence ratio with that of heat release, and used
the results as a direct input into an analytical model for predicting
thermoacoustic instability and LBO. Fig. 29 shows a schematic of the
experimental setup used and time-resolved measurements of the
equivalence ratio calculated from the WMS-2f signal. The results
shown highlight the oscillations in equivalence ratio (induced by
modulating the fuel flow rate) of the gas entering the combustor,
and the FFT reveals that the oscillation occurs at near 50 Hz.

10.2. Gas-turbine combustors at elevated pressure

PKranendonk et al. [38] used an FDML laser spanning 1330 to
1380 nm to measure gas temperature at 200 Hz (after averaging
1000 scans at 200 kHz) via H2O absorption in a gas-turbine combus-
tor. Measurements were acquired at equivalence ratios and pres-
sures from 0.22 bar to 0.32 bar and 3.4 bar to 6.9 bar, respectively,
6 cm downstream of the brightest region of the JP8-fueled combus-
tor. The sensor revealed steady-state temperatures within 50 to
100 K of the semi-empirical flame temperature (derived from a com-
bination of exhaust gas composition measurements and chemical
equilibrium calculations) for each condition studied. The authors
note that a significant aspect of this work was demonstrating the
sensor’s ability to tolerate the bright background emission observed
in the gas-turbine combustor compared to previous combustion
studies performed using FDML lasers (e.g., [36,37]).

PLater, Caswell et al. [312] developed two light sources using fiber
Bragg gratings for measuring gas temperature, H2O, and CH4 in a
high-pressure gas-turbine combustor. In comparison to diode laser-
and FDML-based sensors, the authors point out that these light sour-
ces can provide absorption information at multiple discrete wave-
lengths over a wider spectral range (between 1329 and 1667 nm
here) at high rates (30 kHz). This sensor employed 4 discrete wave-
lengths to yield H2O concentration and optimal thermometry perfor-
mance from 500 to 2500 K and at pressures from 3 to 30 bar, 4

Ptime resolution (10 kHz) [213]. By using a VCSEL the entire H2O
absorption line could be resolved which improved measurement
precision by nearly a factor of 2 compared to previous work done
with the TDL. Most recently, Ebert et al. [266] integrated the afore-
mentioned diode-laser-based sensor into a production 4-cylinder
engine with minimal engine modifications to provide measurements
of H2O concentration at 4 kHz. This sensor used a SMF transmitter
mounted to the engine to pitch light across the cylinder. A probe
with a 45° mirror was used to collect the light and direct the trans-
mitted light 90° (i.e., upwards) into a 600 mm MMF. The authors
used a TDL since the required optical arrangement reduced trans-
mission levels to only 1%, thereby prohibiting the use of the much
lower power VCSEL-based sensor described in [213]. Using this sen-
sor the authors were able to achieve a detection limit as low as
7400 ppm of H2O by volume.

PSeveral researchers have also developed tomography based LAS
sensors for time-resolved, in-cylinder imaging of hydrocarbon fuels
in single- [314] and multi-cylinder engines [313]. In the latter,
trenches for fiber-optics were machined into the engine block to
enable fiber-optic light delivery and collection along 27 LOS. Two
diode lasers at 1700 and 1651 nm were frequency-multiplexed at
300 and 500 kHz to enable simultaneous monitoring of hydrocarbon
absorption and non-resonant extinction. The authors presented
qualitative images of fuel concentration at 3 to 4k frames per second,
and note that the system provided signal on all beams for > 2 hours
of fired operation.

11.2. Engine intake and exhaust

PRecently, Jatana et al. [130,316] developed a TDL sensor for simul-
taneous temperature, H2O, and pressure in the intake manifold, EGR
cooler exit, and turbo-charger inlet of a diesel engine. The sensor
used a single DFB TDL near 1388 nm and custom fabricated mounts
for mounting the photodetectors and SMF transmitters to the engine.
The mounts utilized a ceramic spacer to insulate the optical equip-
ment from the high-temperature (up to 850 K) components without
needing water cooling, and the windows were mechanically sealed
using mica gaskets. By using telecommunication-grade fibers and
splitters this sensor was able to acquire measurements at 4 locations

Ptransition. While this technique does not attempt to resolve the
broadening-coefficients of each individual transition (recognizing
that this would be impractical), it was found to improve results sig-
nificantly compared to previous algorithms that assumed equal line
broadening for all transitions. The same research group later devel-
oped a spacer ring (to be inserted between the engine block and cyl-
inder head) housing fused fiber-lenses for robust transmission and
collection of near-IR laser light despite beam steering [206].

PMore recently, Witzel et al. [315] developed a scanned-wave-
length DA sensor using a tunable diode laser near 1370 nm for mea-
suring H2O concentration at 4 kHz during the compression stroke of
an optically accessible IC-engine. Measurements were acquired at
temperatures and pressures from 300 to 500 K and 0.7 to 5.2 bar.
The laser light was transmitted through the quartz cylinder off-axis
to minimize etalon fringes. Later, this sensor was improved upon by
using a VCSEL near 1370 nm to provide greater scan amplitude and

Psimultaneously. During operation, the laser was scanned across
6 H2O transitions (4 dominant), with E00
ranging from 70 to
1742 cm¡1; at up to 5 kHz. Gas properties were inferred from a spec-
tral-fitting routine. Fig. 31 shows example temperature, H2O, and
pressure results. The sensor was able to achieve an uncertainty in
temperature, pressure, and H2O mole fraction from 1.4 to 4%, 5.5 to
6.5%, and 6.2 to 8.2%, respectively, for temperatures from 300 to 850 K
with measurement precisions ranging from 0.9 to 4%.

12. Sensors for scramjets

flows

combustion

PMany researchers have developed LAS sensors for a variety of
[41,172,175,178,236,258,259,262,
high-speed
263,317(cid:3)320]. Among the most frequently studied applications in this
category are hypervelocity shock tunnels [258,259,321], ramjets, and
scramjets [28,41,129,172,175,182,262,263,317(cid:3)320]. Early work was
conducted in shock tunnels to characterize their hypersonic flow fields
[258,259] and similar efforts continue [321]. Of late, most LAS sensing
in high-speed flows has been done to characterize scramjet flow fields.
The scramjet represents one promising propulsion technology capable
of providing airbreathing hypersonic flight with no moving engine
parts. The scramjet consists of four primary components: inlet, isolator,
combustor, and nozzle. The inlet slows the incoming hypersonic air
through an oblique shock-train, raising the temperature and pressure
of the gas and the isolator is used to homogenize the flow field enter-
ing the combustor. Fuel is directly injected into the high-temperature
air stream to initiate combustion and the combustion gases are
expanded in the nozzle to produce thrust. During operation, the goal is
to combust enough fuel to produce sufficient thrust while avoiding
unstart (i.e., a failure mode where the shock train is expelled from the
isolator yielding subsonic flow throughout the scramjet flow path). As
a result, the performance of a scramjet requires a delicate balance
between a variety of complex physical process, namely, fuel-air mix-
ing, chemical kinetics, and shock-boundary-layer interaction. The need
to understand these processes in situ has driven the development and
application of LAS sensors for characterizing scramjets.

PHistorically, most IR-LAS sensing in scramjets has employed
near-IR telecommunication-grade TDLs for measuring temperature,
H2O, and velocity in continuous-flow facilities
[43,129,172,
182,317,319,322,323], with only one prior example of measuring
CO2 in [318] (later discussed in [41]). Recently, several efforts have
extended sensing capabilities to: 1) the mid-infrared for improved
measurements of H2O [178,320], CO2 [236,320], and the first meas-
urements of CO [236,320] in a hydrocarbon-fueled model scramjet
combustor, 2) 2D via tomography [129,131,184], 3) greater band-
width for improved sensing in impulse facilities [207,263], and 4)
the first in-flight TDLAS measurements for characterizing scramjet
flow fields [26(cid:3)28,324].

12.1. Continuous-flow facilities

PThe recent combined effort presented by Goldenstein et al.
[178], Spearrin et al. [236], and Schultz et al. [320] represents
the first demonstration of mid-infrared LAS sensing of H2O, CO2,
and CO in scramjets, made possible by the advent of thermoelec-
trically cooled quantum-cascade lasers and mid-infrared fibers.
Furthermore, this work represents one of the first applications of
calibration-free scanned-WMS spectral fitting [139] and the use
of the two-color strategy for acquiring path-averaged gas proper-
ties in highly non-uniform flows (discussed in Section 5.1 and
[165]). The combination of these strategies was critical to the
acquisition of accurate measurements due to the large tempera-
ture and composition gradients within the scramjet combustor
studied.

PFig. 32a illustrates a schematic of the model scramjet studied
(the University of Virginia’s Supersonic Combustion Facility
(UVaSCF)) and the orientation of the translating lines-of-sight
used by all sensors. Each laser was fiber-coupled in free-space
into a mid-IR fiber (multi-mode ZBLAN for H2O, bifurcated hol-
low core for CO and CO2) and an X-Y translation stage was used
to translate the measurement line-of-sight throughout the com-
bustor. DFB TDLs near 2482 and 2551 nm were used to measure
H2O and temperature via scanned-WMS-2f/1f, a DFB QCL near
4855 nm was used to measure CO and temperature via scanned-
DA and scanned-WMS-2f/1f, and an external-cavity QCL near
4176 nm was used to measure CO2 via scanned-DA. The use of
stronger fundamental-band absorption enabled access to transi-
tions that are 20 to 104 times stronger than in the near-IR
(depending on species) which improves measurement sensitivity
and enables use of inherently weaker transitions with greater
lower-state energy for improved temperature sensitivity and tol-
erance to thermal non-uniformities [76]. However, these benefits
do not come without challenges, namely that use of wavelengths
beyond 4 mm in a high-temperature, continuous-flow facility
complicates the use of sapphire windows (leading to signifcant
thermally induced temporal fluctuations) and other less robust
materials (e.g., ZnSe) that oxidize in high-temperature combus-
tion gases. More information regarding these complications can
be found in Section 6.2.5.

PFig. 32b shows time-averaged species measurements as a func-
tion of the x-direction (transverse to flow) for two measurement
planes. By comparing the results in the top panel (downstream
plane) to the bottom panel (upstream plane) it is clear that the com-
bustion products expand into the freestream. Furthermore, at loca-
tions near the flame-holding cavity the column-density of COCCO2
agrees remarkably well with that of H2O indicating that most of the
carbon and hydrogen atoms originally contained in the fuel (C2H4)

Phave moved to CO, CO2, and H2O respectively. Conversely, at loca-
tions near the high-speed free-stream (i.e., far from the cavity), the
column density of COCCO2 is significantly less compared to H2O
indicating the presence of unburned fuel/hydrocarbons at this loca-
tion in the flow. These results enable a variety of interesting conclu-
sions regarding the spatio-temporal evolution of combustion
progress that would not be possible without acquiring multi-species
measurements.

PBrown et al. [129] demonstrated the use of a tunable diode-laser
absorption tomography (TDLAT) sensor for coarse reconstruction of
temperature and H2O at the exit of a ground-test scramjet designed
to replicate the HIFiRE 2 scramjet. This sensor employed three time-
multiplexed diode lasers near 1.4 mm along 14 lines-of-sight (8 ver-
tical, 6 horizontal). Algebraic reconstruction tomography (ART) was
used to reconstruct the 2D distribution of absorbance for each color
since it is more suitable than filtered back projection techniques in
cases with a limited number of LOS measurements. After the 2D
integrated absorption of each color was reconstructed, the gas tem-
perature and water mole fraction were calculated in a 9 £ 19 pixel
image using standard LAS techniques. During steady-state operation,
the 2D distributions of H2O and temperature indicate burning in the
core of the flow with local hotspots and the distributions were found
to vary substantially in time, indicating the role of turbulent com-
bustion.

PBusa et al. [182] documented the design and initial implementa-
tion of a TDLAT system for 2D temperature and H2O concentration at
NASA Langley’s direct-connect supersonic combustion test facility
(DCSCTF) employing a fan-beam geometry and retroreflector to
return the transmitted light to the pitch/catch optics. A rotational
stage was used to rotate 5 separate transmitter/reciever boxes 72
degrees for an effective rotation of 360 degrees. Most recently, Busa
et al. [131] reported the use of TDLAT and stereoscopic PIV for deter-
mination of combustion efficiency via spatially resolved measure-
ments of temperature and H2O number density (via TDLAT) and
velocity (via stereo-PIV) at the exit of the UVaSCF. The authors used
a similar experimental setup to acquire absorption measurements
along 1400 lines-of-sight and provide high-resolution (2 mm £
2 mm pixels) measurements of H2O. By combining these

jet testing with TDLAS sensors. For more details see [262].

Pmeasurements with the measured velocity field (obtained via ste-
reoscopic PIV) and comparing the H2O flux with that of the H2-fuel
flux, the authors were able to calculate the combustion efficiency of
the heterogeneous flow for various operating conditions.

12.2. Impulse facilities

PShock tunnels have been used to generate short-duration hyper-
sonic flows with flight-enthalpies (typically > Mach 5) that are too
extreme to sustain in continuous-flow ground-test facilities. In prac-
tice, such facilities shock-heat gases to high-enthalpy conditions and
then expand them, for example, through a nozzle to generate hyper-
sonic flow (see Fig. 33). As a result, these facilities offer a unique
opportunity to study scramjets in the laboratory at more extreme
flight conditions. Shock tunnels pose a number of unique challenges
including short test times (order of 1 ms), transient flow conditions,
and limited optical access. Despite these challenges, several
researchers have developed TDLAS sensors for characterizing
such tunnels [258,259] and test articles housed within them
[262,263,325].

PTwo TDLAS measurement campaigns were recently conducted in
model-scramjet combustors located within shock tunnels at ATK
GASL [262] and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) [207]. Fig. 34
shows a schematic of the experimental setup used and example
results for a single test. Both sensors utilized DFB TDLs near 1.4 mm
with scanned-WMS-2f/1f to measure gas temperature and H2O

Pconcentration along three lines-of-sight
(at various locations
depending on test) to quantify the evolution of combustion progress
in space. In addition, the work conducted by Strand [207] employed
angled beams for velocimetry. The two campaigns used similar opti-
cal hardware for light delivery and optical alignment. The fibers
were housed in a protective pipe and the pitch and catch optics
were located behind a protective shield to protect all components
from the high-speed flow. The results shown in Fig. 34 highlight the
utility of high-speed (25 kHz), multi-line-of-sight measurements for
characterizing the combustion process. The measurements indicate
relatively stable combustion, but with some strong-, and rapid-
(time-scale of 1 ms) fluctuations in temperature and H2O despite a
temporally stable wall-pressure. The TDLAS measurements also
reveal a strong bias of combustion products towards the fuel-injec-
tor wall.

12.3. In-flight tests

PBrown et al. [28] presented the use of two independently devel-
oped TDLAS sensors for onboard measurements of O2 in a hypersonic
vehicle as part of the HIFiRE I test campaign. The sensor developed
by Zolo Technologies used scanned-wavelength direct absorption
[26] while the sensor developed by Southwest Sciences used
scanned-WMS [27]. Both sensors employed angled lines-of-sight
across mock-inlet flow paths to infer the flow velocity from the
Doppler-shifted absorption, with the ultimate goal of measuring O2
mass flux entering the combustor. The scanned-DA sensor employed
a scan rate of 5 kHz and multiple scans were averaged to yield a
measurement rate of 10 Hz. The scanned-WMS sensor used a scan
rate of 1 kHz and averaged the output to a measurement rate of
1 Hz. Both sensors used lasers near 760 nm and the WMS sensor also
included an onboard reference cell for active laser frequency stabili-
zation and a reference signal for velocimetry. As expected, the mea-
sured WMS lineshapes exhibited a greater signal-to-noise ratio than
those of DA. During the flight, both sensors maintained alignment
and operated as planned for 17 s, after which the telemetry system
for the WMS sensor began to operate unreliably. While no quantita-
tive results are reported, it is clear that this work represents an
impressive and encouraging demonstration of stand-alone TDLAS
sensors for characterizing hostile systems.

PMore recently, in-flight TDLAS measurements of H2O and tem-
perature were acquired along 8 lines-of-sight traversing the exit
plane of the HIFiRE 2 scramjet combustor [324] (see Fig. 35). Two
independent systems were used, each employing a single DFB TDL
scanned across multiple H2O transitions near 1.4 mm at 50 kHz. The
authors note that both systems operated successfully in flight, and

13. Sensors for detonation combustors

transition. Afterwhich,

PThe thermodynamic advantages of high-temperature and -pres-
sure combustion and the desire to minimize moving parts in com-
bustion systems has driven the development of a variety of
detonation-based combustors and engines. To date, pulse-detona-
tion engines/combustors (PDEs, PDCs) have received the most atten-
tion due to their relatively simple architecture. In a PDE, fuel is
intermittently injected into an open-ended combustor and, upon
mixing with air, is ignited to form a deflagration wave which propa-
it undergoes deflagration-to-
gates down the combustor until
detonation (DDT)
the detonation wave
propagates through the remainder of the combustor, thereby elevat-
ing the temperature and pressure of the unburnt air-fuel mixture
(through shock-compression) and initiating combustion. The com-
bustion gases are then expanded to produce thrust or mechanical
work. Like PDEs, rotating-detonation engines and combustors (RDEs,
RDCs) represent a promising strategy for achieving the benefits of
high-pressure combustion without moving parts. However, in con-
trast to a PDE, in an RDE fuel and air are continuously supplied to an
annular combustor and a detonation wave continuously travels
around the annulus consuming the air-fuel charge located ahead of
the wave. Fig. 36 illustrates this concept via a CFD temperature map
reported by Schwer and Kailasanath [326]. This continuous opera-
tion has several benefits, including (1) removing the need for a high-
frequency repeatable ignition system and (2) enabling much higher
operation frequencies (order of kHz compared to 100 Hz for PDE)
which leads to higher thrust/power and a comparatively steady out-
put that is more favorable for integration with gas turbines. Due to
these benefits, research and development efforts have recently
shifted focus to RDEs, however, prior IR-LAS work in PDEs has served
as an important stepping stone to current RDE-sensing efforts.

PWhile mechanically simple, the need to understand the complex
physics (e.g., DDT, kinetics) governing these systems has driven the
application and, in many cases, the development of IR-LAS sensors
for high-bandwidth measurements of chemical species and thermo-
dynamic conditions at extreme temperatures and pressures. These
devices are capable of producing temperatures and pressures in
excess of 4000 K and 100 bar, respectively, with changes in tempera-
ture and pressure of comparable magnitude occuring on ms to ms
timescales. Further these systems are extremely hostile, producing
strong and high-frequency vibrations which can compromise the
fidelity of IR-LAS measurements. RDEs pose even greater challenges,
most notably, the absence of line-of-sight optical access through the
combustor and the demand to resolve detonation events with
microsecond resolution. As a result, detonation engines present one
of the most challenging environments for LAS sensors.

PThe first generation of LAS sensors deployed in detonation
engines used fixed-wavelength telecommunication-grade diode

Plasers for monitoring temperature, H2O, fuel, and particulate volume
fraction [126]. Later, the use of cesium-absorption-based sensors for
measurements of temperature and pressure at 2000(cid:3)4000 K and 0.5
to 30 atm [34] and time-of-flight velocimetry [35] were explored
using a rapidly scanned VCSEL laser. Mattison et al. [327] developed
a scanned-wavelength TDLAS sensor for temperature and H2O in a
PDE and Klingbeil et al. [108] developed one of the first fiber-coupled
mid-IR sensors for monitoring JP8 at 3.4 mm in a PDE. While these
early works are impressive, this section will focus on several recent
manuscripts which have significantly advanced the state of IR-LAS
sensors for detonation environments by avoiding the need to (1) cor-
rect for non-resonant transmission losses and (2) seed atomic
absorbers for high-SNR measurements, while also enabling the mea-
surement of new performance parameters (e.g., enthalpy, mole frac-
tion of carbon oxides). These advancements have come through the
use of: (1) hyperspectral direct absorption and (2) WMS at mid-
infrared wavelengths. Further, advancements in optical engineering
have enabled, to the best of our knowledge, the first single-ended
measurements in a combustor.

13.1. Pulse-detonation combustors

PCaswell et al. [212,328] used three time-division multiplexed
(TDM) FDML lasers to provide simultaneous measurements of
gas temperature, H2O, pressure, and velocity at 50 kHz in an H2-
fueled PDC at two measurement locations upstream and one
downstream of a gas turbine. This sensor used three FDML lasers
to perform piecewise continuous-swept-wavelength measure-
ments of the H2O absorption spectrum near 1350.5, 1355.85,
and 1362.31 nm to infer gas properties. Interrogating H2O in
these spectral windows (identified via the wavelength-selection
algorithm developed by An et al. [209]) enabled near optimal
temperature sensitivity. Fig. 37 shows a schematic of the experi-
mental setup used. This sensor also employed novel fiber-
optic fixtures that deploy counter-propagating laser beams both
angled at 45° relative to the flow direction to provide velocity
measurements in a compact manner.

PFig. 37 shows time-resolved measurements of temperature, pres-
sure, H2O, velocity and enthalpy for two consecutive PDC cycles. Gas
properties were calculated in a manner similar to that of Kranen-
donk et al. [214] using the HITEMP database [47]. A linear baseline
correction was applied to measured and simulated spectra for con-
sistency and instrument broadening was estimated from measure-
ments of H2O spectra at 15 torr and 300 K, and was then accounted
for in the least-squares fitting routine used to calculate gas proper-
ties. Measurements are presented for temperatures and pressures
up to 2500 K and 8 bar without the turbine present, and near 2000 K
and 4 bar with the turbine present. The authors point out that meas-
urements could not be acquired until 60 m s after the detonation
wave passed due to extreme beam steering and pressure broaden-
ing. The authors clarify that additional collisional-broadening data is
required to improve upon these proof-of-concept pressure measure-
ments. Regardless, this novel use of multi-parameter measurements
enabled the calculation of the time-resolved mass flux and enthalpy
which provides valuable information for understanding the
unsteady performance of the turbine.

PAround the same time, Goldenstein et al.

[237,329] and
Spearrin et al. [330] developed and applied WMS-2f/1f-based
sensors for temperature, H2O, CO2, and CO in an ethylene-fueled
PDC. Measurements were acquired in the combustion chamber
and in a choked throat of a converging-diverging nozzle to
enable determination of the flow speed, mass flow rate, and
enthalpy flow rate from measurements of gas temperature, H2O,
CO2, CO and pressure. Acquiring measurements in a choked
throat offers a number of design opportunities, namely, a veloc-
ity measurement with sensitivity and accuracy that is nearly
independent of pressure (provided that the temperature and spe-
cies measurements are accurate). This is particularly advanta-
geous when high pressures (up to 50 atm) and pronouned
collisional broadening could significantly compromise the preci-
sion of a Doppler-shift-based velocity measurement.

PThe WMS sensors were demonstrated and validated with meas-
urements behind reflected shock waves in shock tubes at known
temperatures and pressures up to 2700 K and 50 atm. The details

Pregarding the sensor design and validation are documented in
[101,106,139,203]. DFB diode lasers near 1392 and 1469 nm were
used to measure temperature and H2O in the throat with a band-
width of 10 kHz, and DFB TDLs near 2474 an 2482 were used to mea-
sure temperature and H2O in the combustion chamber with a
bandwidth of 9 kHz. A DFB TDL near 2678 nm and a DFB QCL near
4854 nm were used to measure CO2 and CO with bandwidths of
2 kHz and 20 kHz, respectively. The lasers were modulated at fre-
quencies from 35 to 200 kHz. The near-IR temperature and H2O sen-
sor used polarization maintaing SMF, while the mid-IR H2O and CO2
sensors used ZBLAN fibers, and the CO sensor used an InF3 SMF. All
photodetectors were mounted directly to the PDC to facilitate align-
ment and improve light collection. The wavelengths and modulation
depths of all H2O lasers were chosen according to the procedure
developed by Goldenstein et al. [203] to provide sensitive thermom-
etry and mole fraction sensing from 5 to 50 atm and 1000 to 3000 K.
Free-space fiber coupling and delivery systems were designed for
the mid-infrared wavelengths as described by Spearrin et al.
[101,106]. This involved utilization of newly developed single-mode
fluoride glass fibers ((cid:1)5 m) which significantly mitigated bending
losses and multimodal dispersion noise [331] while allowing the
more sensitive mid-infrared lasers to be located remotely from the
combustor test cell.

PFig. 38 shows time-resolved measurements of temperature, H2O,
CO, CO2, and pressure for a single cycle. The pressure was measured

Pat each measurement location using a Kulite pressure transducer.
The detection limits of the MIR-H2O, -CO, -CO2, and NIR-H2O sensors
varied from 0.083-0.5%, 0.05-0.6%, 0.1(cid:3)2.2%, and 1(cid:3)4% by mole,
respectively, across the PDC cycle. Despite having to use signifcantly
lower modulation frequencies, the detection limit of the mid-IR sen-
sor was 5 to 10x smaller than that of the near-IR temperature and
H2O sensor, again highlighting the benefits of using strong mid-
infrared absorption. Fig. 39 shows the time-resolved enthalpy calcu-
lated from the measured temperature, pressure, and gas composi-
tion and using a choked-flow assumption. The results indicate peak
enthalpy flow rates consistently near 25 MW. The authors present a
thorough uncertainty analysis of the enthalpy calculation, recogniz-
ing that choked flow is not established until approximately 125 m s
after the detonation wave passes and that the sonic plane is, in real-
ity, located slightly downstream of the throat/measurement plane
yielding a Mach number closer to 0.98 at the measurement location.
For the uncertainties in temperature, pressure, composition, and
Mach number, the authors quote a root-sum-squared uncertainty in
the enthalpy flow rate of 15% for the first 125 ms and 6% for longer
times.

13.2. Rotating-detonation combustors

PRDEs were first conceptualized in the 1950s, however the com-
plex physics behind their operation delayed the development of

Pauthors also report how the exhaust gas temperature, velocity and
H2O concentration varied with equivalence ratio and mass flow rate.
PGoldenstein et al. [145] developed and deployed dual two-color
LAS sensors using WMS-2f/1f for measurements of temperature and
H2O at 10 and 50 kHz in the throat of a converging-diverging nozzle
attached to an H2-fueled RDC. One pair of diode lasers was used to
interrogate H2O transitions near 2551 and 2482 nm with E” of 704
and 2660 cm¡1; respectively, and another pair of diode lasers was
used to interrogate H2O transitions near 1392 and 1469 nm with E”
of 1045 and 3291 cm¡1; respectively. This was done to quantify the
thermal uniformity of the exhaust using a method similar to that of
Seitzman and Scully [168]. Measurements were acquired at global
equivalence ratios from near 0.7 to 1 (achieved by varying the mass
flow rate of air with fuel flow rate fixed). In all cases, the tempera-
ture measurements acquired at 50 kHz clearly revealed oscillations
in temperature and H2O at the characteristic frequency of the deto-
nation wave ((cid:1)3.25 kHz). The difference between the “hot” and
“cold” temperatures measured by the near-IR and mid-IR lasers,
respectively, was found to increase from 2 to 8% as the air flow rate
increased from 1.2 to 1.5 kg/s indicating a pronounced correlation
between the air mass flow rate and thermal stratification of the
exhaust. In addition, the H2O production was found to decrease only
slightly with increasing air flow rate (i.e., decreasing equivalence
ratio) suggesting that air-fuel mixing was the primary factor leading
to the low combustion efficiencies observed (only 40(cid:3)60%).

PMost recently, Rein et al. [202] presented the first measurements
of temperature and H2O in the annular combustor using a single-
ended fiber-coupled sensor. The authors used a MEMS VCSEL to
measure the absorption spectra of H2O from 1330 to 1365 nm at
100 kHz and yield temperature and H2O concentration. A fiber-bun-
dle housing a single-mode pitch fiber and a multi-mode catch fiber
(see Fig. 23) was used to pitch laser light into the combustor and col-
lect the light backscattered off the RDE centerbody. The annular gap
in the H2-fueled RDE was 0.76 cm yielding an effective path length
of 1.52 cm and measurements were acquired 25.4 and 50.8 mm
downstream of the fuel plenum. The authors found a strong correla-
tion between the gas temperature and air-mass flow rate which
they primarily attributed to the location of the measurement with
respect to that of the detonation wave (it was previously shown that
the axial-depth of the detonation wave exhibits a strong correlation
with the air mass flow rate [333]). Fig. 40 shows that the nominal
gas temperature varied from near 500 K up to 1200 K as the air mass

Pfunctional RDEs until relatively recently. Due to their recent devel-
opment, only three archival papers have reported the use of LAS sen-
sors for RDEs and all three reported measurements of temperature
and H2O [145,202,332]. These sensors have enabled some insightful
observations and conclusions regarding the current state of RDEs
and have overcome significant hurdles that complicate the imple-
mentation of laser-absorption sensors into RDEs. The remainder of
this section will discuss these recent works.

PThe first LAS sensors for RDEs were deployed to characterize the
exhaust of H2-fueled RDCs [145,332] and only recently have authors
begun developing and deploying sensors for RDC combustors [202].
Regarding sensors for RDC exhaust, McGahan et al. [332] used two
VCSELs to measure the absorption spectra of H2O from 7435 to
7442 cm¡1 and 7465 to 7471 cm¡1; thereby enabling calculation of
the gas temperature, H2O concentration, and velocity using
scanned-wavelength direct-absorption. The sensor details provided
are relatively sparse, but several conclusions were provided. The
TDLAS measurements indicate that the RDE exhaust reaches nomi-
nally steady conditions approximately 9 ms after ignition with a
velocity of 364 § 110 m/s and standard deviations in temperature
and H2O concentration of 50 K and 0.08 moles/m3, respectively. The

Pflow rate increased from 0.15 to 0.61 kg/s with a fixed equivalence
ratio near 1. In addition, the authors found that the gas temperature
measured at the downstream location was significantly colder than
that of the upstream location located within the detonation wave.

14. Conclusions

POver the last 15 years, great progress has been made in the devel-
opment of a wide range of IR-LAS techniques and sensors. Perhaps
most importantly, the application of IR-LAS sensors to practical com-
bustion systems has dramatically expanded. To name only a few
examples, sensors have been developed for power plants, gasifiers,
gas turbines, hypersonic-flow facilities, IC-engines, detonation com-
bustors, and even in-flight experiments onboard a scramjet. In doing
so, these sensors have been extended to new limits and capabilities
via the development of improved diagnostic techniques and spectro-
scopic models, novel optical assemblies, and new light sources. This
section will highlight the key takeaways of these works and discuss
some of the remaining needs and challenges researchers are facing
today.

14.1. Key takeaways

P14.1.1. Techniques

PImprovements in modeling scanned-WMS signals [138,139] have
enabled the development of a calibration-free scanned-WMS spec-
tral-fitting technique [139] that requires no more spectroscopic
information than conventional scanned-wavelength direct absorp-
tion. As a result, this technique extends the advantages of WMS to
gases with unknown collisional broadening and/or line-of-sight
non-uniformities, and was first deployed in the field to study a
scramjet combustor [178] and a coal gasifier [295]. Further, 1f-nor-
malized WMS has enabled high-fidelity measurements of gas prop-
erties in particulate-laden flows and in single-ended (i.e., stand-off)
configurations despite optical-transmission-loss factors of 103 to
105. These advancements offer great potential for extending WMS-
based sensors to increasingly harsh environments and more com-
plex conditions, and further improve the prospects for real-time
monitoring and control of combustion systems via WMS-based
sensors.

PA variety of hyperspectral sources and techniques have also
emerged. Such techniques have demonstrated the ability to provide
multi-parameter measurements of gas properties at rates up to
100 kHz in harsh environments [202,212]. In addition, these sources
have enabled the development of hyperspectral tomographic techni-
ques which leverage additional spectral information to reduce the
number of projections needed to reconstruct the measurement field
[183]. As hyperspectral sources continue to evolve and emerge in
new spectral regions, the potential for them to provide improved
multi-parameter measurements will continue to grow.

PCavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy in low-finesse optical
cavities has demonstrated the ability to provide improved
((cid:1)50(cid:3)100£ better detection limits) measurements of trace gases
formed behind reflected shock waves [159,160,287]. The use of a
low-finesse

((cid:1)50(cid:3)100 kHz) scanned-wavelength measurements of absorption
spectra while also being less sensitive (compared to high-finesse
cavities) to mirror fouling. The combination of these benefits offers
many unique opportunities for time-resolved monitoring of trace
gases in relatively harsh environments.

P14.1.2. Mid-IR sensing

PMid-infrared semiconductor lasers and fibers have enabled
measurements of key-combustion species in environments with
concentrations and path lengths that would have precluded high-
fidelity monitoring via near-IR sources. Perhaps most notably, these

Psources greatly improve our ability to measure CO and CO2 at condi-
tions and scales relevant to combustion systems. This is illustrated
by the CO and CO2 measurements recently acquired in scramjet and
pulse-detonation combustors [236,237]. At present, mid-IR lasers,
fibers, and detectors are sufficiently robust, compact, and affordable
to enable monitoring of harsh combustors, and we expect their role
in combustion research within academia and industry to grow rap-
idly as this technology improves.

P14.1.3. Measurements of high-pressure gases

PAdvancements in WMS techniques and mid-IR semiconductor
lasers have enable the development and application of improved
sensors for monitoring temperature, H2O, CO, CO2, and NO in high-
pressure gases [101,106,115,203,210]. These sensors have demon-
strated the ability to measure temperature and species concentra-
tions at 10s of kHz in the laboratory and the field, at conditions
ranging from 10 to 150 atm. Measurements at known conditions
behind reflected shock waves were used to validate the accuracy of
these sensors and, in some cases, to refine the spectroscopic models
at extreme thermodynamic conditions. We expect the development

world combustors; however, this remains an active area of research.

P14.1.4. Optical engineering

PNumerous researchers have developed clever optical assemblies
for integrating IR-LAS sensors into combustion systems with limited
Internal-combustion engines and, more recently,
optical access.
rotating detonation engines have driven the development of many
of these assemblies. For example, cleaved sapphire rods and compact
optics have been used to provide optical access into burners [177]
and IC-engines [206,266], respectively. Further, fiber-bundles have
spark-plugs
IR-LAS
been used to
[42,260,267(cid:3)269], detonation combustors [202,212], and to provide
single-ended measurements via the collection of backscattered laser
light [202,265,270]. Single-ended sensing represents a particularly
promising emerging frontier as it offers the potential to study many
new applications and problems that were deemed inaccessible
before.

14.2. Remaining needs and challenges

PDespite the progress in the development of IR-LAS sensors for
combustion, extensive research remains needed. Spectroscopic data-
bases for molecular spectra at high-temperatures and -pressures
continue to suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy, primarily due to
errors and complexities associated with calculating collisional-
broadening coefficients and lineshapes. Furthermore, these data-
bases are applicable to a relatively small number of species of inter-
est to combustion (namely, CO, CO2, H2O, NO, OH). As a result,
research to improve the accuracy and breadth of spectroscopic data-
bases relevant to combustion is needed, particularly to improve sen-
sor accuracy and assist the design of sensors for high pressures.

PImprovements in mid-infrared hardware and optical materials
are also needed. While useful, the power, stability, tuning ability,
and life-time of mid-infrared lasers is frequently inferior to their
near-IR analogues. This currently limits the accuracy and precision
of mid-infrared sensors below what is theoretically obtainable (e.g.,
due to their increased absorption strength) and complicates the inte-
gration of mid-infrared sensors into practical combustion systems
outside the laboratory. Improvements in mid-infrared fiber and opti-
cal materials are also needed. Mid-IR fibers suffer from significantly
larger bend losses and transmission losses which complicates or pre-
cludes remote placement of lasers. Materials that can tolerate high
temperatures, pressures, and combustion gases with high transmis-
sion levels beyond 5 mm are also needed. This currently represents a
major obstacle to improved detection of several species important

Pto combustion systems (e.g., NO, NH3, hydrocarbons). Extending
recently developed single-ended LAS packages to the mid-infrared is
also needed.

PLastly, sensors for multi-species measurements and measure-
ments at high pressures remain research fronts. While some promis-
ing work has been conducted, the potential of IR-LAS to expand
sensing capabilities in these areas has yet to be realized. Prospects
light-sources
for improvement include the use of hyperspectral
which can access multiple absorption bands and WMS techniques
incorporating novel modulation techniques and frequency-multi-
plexing of multiple narrowband light sources.

PWe expect that the role of IR-LAS in combustion will continue
to grow as researchers continue to improve and expand the
capabilities of IR-LAS and improved light sources and hardware
are developed. While some techniques are only in their infancy,
others have matured into robust sensors capable of characteriz-
ing a wide range of practical combustion systems. As a result,
we now embark on a time where the potential to not only
improve our understanding of, but also control combustion devi-
ces has never been greater.

Acknowledgments

PThe authors thank their many colleagues worldwide for allowing
their work to be discussed and shown here. Further, the authors
thank Scott Sanders and Gregory Rieker for their valuable feedback
regarding the status of hyperspectral sources and techniques, as
