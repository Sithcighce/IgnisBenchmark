The humidification-dehumidification desalination system is known as an appealing process for small and
medium scales, and high-salinity water desalination. These systems consist of humidifier and dehumid-
ifier as the main components, energy sources for heating and electrical energy generation, accessories
used for the fluid transfer or efficiency improvement, and measurement/control devices. Different sys-
tem designs are reported and categorized based on enhancement in productivity, energy consumption
and effective parameters such as gained output ratio, specific electrical energy consumption and pro-
duction cost. According to input energy types and used components, these systems react differently, and
the performance parameters change. This literature reviews past/current status and future ideas about
humidification-dehumidification systems to pave the way for the researchers to improve this technology.
All technologies that improve the humidification-dehumidification system performance via using efficient
constitutes, renewable energy, heat recovery via multi-effect and multi-stage processes, accelerating the
humidification and dehumidification processes by pressure variation or using heat pump as well as exergy
and cost analyses are clarified. It is concluded that despite improving humidification-dehumidification
system as a promising process for decentralized small-scale freshwater production applications, it re-
quires further development to improve the system performance based on gained output ratio and econ-
omy.

1. Introduction

The  life  continuation  of  human  beings  depends  on  freshwa-
ter.  Despite  being  one  of  the  most  abundant  resources  in  the
earth, nearly 97% of the water is of extraordinary salinity. It is vi-
tal to address the water shortage with saline water desalination
[1] .  This  has  been  approved  as  a  scientifically  worthwhile  solu-
tion to overcome the challenges accompanying population growth
and  industrialization,  causing  water  shortages  in  many  areas  of
the world, particularly South America, the Middle East and North
Africa [2] . Several thermal and membrane desalination technolo-
gies  have  been  introduced  to  overcome  the  water  shortage  [3] .
They  include  humidification-dehumidification  (HDH),  multi-stage
flash (MSF), multi-effect distillation (MED), thermal/mechanical va-
por compression (TVC/MVC) and reverse/forward osmosis (RO/FO)
processes.  Among  them,  MSF,  MED,  MVC,  TVC,  FO  and  RO  are
proper for large capacities, while HDH is appropriate for medium
or small scale desalination systems [4] . Note that large-scale de-
salination plants (e.g., MSF and RO) are mostly fossil fuel-driven
with a large carbon footprint, and are sensitive to the availability
of fuel and price or require expert operators [5] .

The HDH desalination unit mimics the rain cycle. Its advantages

over other desalination processes are considerable including:

- the capability of utilizing brine [6] ;
- a proper technology for small or medium scale desalinated wa-

ter production [7] ;

- the capability of using low-grade and renewable thermal ener-

gies [8] ;

- ability to run with a high range of salinity from brackish to sea
water with even improved performance at higher salinity [9] ;
- possibility  of  providing  the  required  energy  by  photovoltaic

(PV) panels [10] ;

- simple  construction  and  low-cost  operation  and  maintenance

[11] .

Beside those benefits, HDH suffers from some drawbacks such

as:

- low energy efficiency compared to other desalination technolo-

gies (e.g., MSF) [12] ;

- low  water  production  scale  compared  to  MSF,  MED  and  RO

[13] ;

- limited commercial availability [14] ;
- low thermal efficiency due to maintaining the water tempera-

ture below the scale formation threshold [15] ;

- large area requirement leading to high capital cost [16] .

These disadvantages are the key factors that limit the applica-
tion of HDH system. Nevertheless, it is notable that there are many
advantages gained using HDH systems, which may well overweigh
their disadvantages.

In  1964,  the  first  large  scale  solar-assisted  HDH  desalination
system  was  built  in  Mexico.  The  plant  had  a  freshwater  capac-
ity of 18 m 3 /d during summer. The solar plant was operated until
1965, which was then transferred to use the waste heat generated
by a diesel engine. Consequently, this plant was changed to air-
extraction humidifier design to increase its productivity, which has
been a recent research topic in HDH desalination [14] . The basic
needs of freshwater (for drinking and cooking) of a family of five
is in the range of 20-50 L/d. Since HDH technology is capable of

meeting such capacities, most researches are focused on the lab-
oratory scale HDH plants [17] . HDH systems are classified based
on ( 1 ) the energy source, ( 2 ) the air and water circulation cycles,
and ( 3 ) the types of heating sources for water and/or air. Recently,
some studies have been conducted on process optimization [18] ,
system optimization through advanced humidifier and dehumidi-
fier modifications or heating sources [19] , and coupled modes [20] ,
which are presented in this paper. The process and design opti-
mizations in such studies proceed through ( 1 ) one factor at a time
method; ( 2 ) design of experiment; ( 3 ) genetic algorithm that con-
tains optimization sub-field; ( 4 ) MATLAB software; and ( 5 ) BON-
MIN tool under GAMS optimization software.

The conventional HDH desalination system consisted of dehu-
midifier and humidifier, fluid transfer units (e.g., pump and fan).
In  conventional  HDH  processes,  the  dehumidifier  and  humidifier
operate at atmospheric pressure.

A humidifier is a tower where the evaporated saline water con-
tacts with an air stream or other carrier gases such as Ar, He or
CO
2  [ 21 , 22 ].  The  water  diffuses  into  the  air/gas  to  be  saturated.
This  tower  can  be  a  packed  bed  containing  different  packings,
spray tower, bubble or wetted wall columns. All humidifier designs
are known to increase the moisture content of the leaving air. Note
that during the humidification process within the humidifier and
due to liberating the latent heat of water vapor by contacting with
process air, water cools down and the process air temperature de-
creases.  In  other  words,  the  humidifier  acts  similar  to  a  cooling
tower. For compensating this effect, the heated saline water and
air are used.

An engineering application for the HDH technology is concen-
trating biogas slurries to improve their quality and develop more
feasible methods to create proper conditions for sustainable uti-
lization  of  slurries  [23] .  Furthermore,  desalinated  water  is  pro-
duced from the humid air leaving the humidifier, treating biogas
slurry by the HDH system. An acceptable efficiency for the water
removal  in  a  relative  short  heating  time  was  achieved.  A  rotary
evaporation vessel was proposed as the humidifier. Heating time
and initial pH of the slurry are effective parameters that are typi-
cally not considered in seawater HDH desalination process.

The outlet humid air from the humidifier enters the dehumidi-
fier to be cooled down. Different heat exchanger designs are used
such as plate fin tube, bubble column, and desiccant types. The hu-
mid air cools down while the saline water slightly preheats before
it reaches the heater. As the air temperature decreases, its specific
humidity also decreases. This releases moisture that has been car-
ried out by the humid air.

Different configurations of close air/open water (CAOW), open
air/open water (OAOW) and open air/closed water (OACW) cycles
are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Note that the closed cycles of water and air
improve energy recovery since the input energy used for water/air
heating  is  preserved  in  the  process.  The  process  air  is  used  for
water preheating within the dehumidifier and the brine decreases
the required input energy for heating the feed water. Low produc-
tivity despite high energy consumption encourages researchers to
improve the system performance. To this end, some solutions will
be discussed in the next sections. In the HDH process, water and
air heat to accelerate the evaporation rate. It has been predicted
that water heated HDH process (WH-HDH) has higher performance
than  air  heated  HDH  process  (AH-HDH)  due  to  the  higher  heat
capacity  of  water  compared  to  air  [24] .  It  should  be  noted  that

the  water,  air  or  both  can  be  heated.  HDH  systems  are  applica-
ble  in  wide  ranges  of  temperatures  and  humidity  ratios.  Water
heated OAOW cycle always outperforms water heated CAOW cycle
regardless of the ambient relative humidity. On the other hand, air
heated CAOW cycle usually surpasses OAOW cycle except when the
ambient relative humidity approaches 100% [25] . In a hot region
with high relative humidity, there is no need to run a humidifier
and humidification energy could be conserved, but dehumidifica-
tion of humid air should be carried out by means of a heat pump
(HP). In a hot region with low relative humidity, humidifier should
be considered for air humidification, but dehumidification is pos-
sible without use of HP. The psychrometric chart confirms that in
the later regions, the absolute humidity is lower than that in the
regions having low temperature with high relative humidity. When
the difference between the absolute humidity of inlet dry air into
the humidifier and humid air at the outlet of humidifier is higher
(which improves the driving force due to the difference in vapor
concentration), it causes the dry air carry more vapor compared to
regions with higher absolute humidity.

Several  researchers  have  reviewed  HDH  field.  For  instance,
Parekh et al. [26] presented a technical review on ME-SS and so-
lar ME-HDH processes. The HDH with different configurations were
analyzed and the influence of main parameters on the energy effi-
ciency and productivity was reported. System optimization and us-
ing horizontal falling film evaporator and condenser, and thermal
storage system in solar ME-HDH were recommended. Al-Hallaj et
al. [27] and Moumouh et al. [28] reviewed solar assisted HDH de-
salination systems based on overall efficiency and economic anal-
ysis.  They  found  no  judgmentally  strong  basis  for  the  cost  of  a
tight range of water production in solar systems. Furthermore, the
solar assisted HDH process was introduced as a convenient pro-
cess  at  an  attractive  cost.  Narayan  et  al.  [11]  and  Abdelmoez  et
al. [5] published detailed reviews on solar HDH focusing on dif-
ferent  cycles  and  their  constituents  (i.e.  humidifier,  dehumidifier
and solar heater). They analyzed different HDH cycles through psy-
chrometric chart to show the increase of specific humidity when
modifying the system through heat recovery by closing the air or
water path. Zhani [29] modeled the constitutes of an HDH system
through mass and heat transfer balances. The model was validated
by comparing with experimental results, and GOR and thermal ef-

ficiency were determined in several systems. Moreover, the effect
of parameters and solar heater thermal efficiency on productivity
were reported. Vadalia et al. [7] analyzed various solar HDH plants
based on their thermodynamic performances. They compared dif-
ferent configurations and confirmed the necessity of balancing the
humidifier and the dehumidifier by extraction-injection technology
to obtain heat capacity ratio (HCR) close to 1. The main parameters
were introduced and their effects on GOR were analyzed through
psychrometric chart. Technological advancements in solar assisted
HDH  systems  were  investigated  by  Santosh  et  al.  [30] .  They  in-
troduced different solar heaters used in HDH processes for heat-
ing the air or water. Using forced circulation mechanism, ME-HDH,
phase change material, coupling solar HDH with other renewable
energies or SS were recommended. It was focused on solar assisted
HDH  systems  rather  than  other  renewable  energies.  Kasaeian  et
al. [31] reviewed solar HDH plants through experimental and nu-
merical studies, optimization, and exergetic and economic analy-
ses. They analyzed different solar assisted HDH processes based on
productivity and production cost. Faegh et al. [32] reviewed HDH
integrated with refrigeration and power cycles. It was concluded
that there was a large gap between GOR of theoretical and exper-
imental studies due to the ideal assumptions as well as efficiency
and size of components. They analyzed Organic Rankine cycle us-
ing various working fluids, Kalina and Rankine cycles. They found
that coupling a Kalina cycle to an HDH system can be a promising
alternative due to its higher performance compared to an organic
Rankine cycle.

Though some of the mentioned reviews were mostly based on
solar  energy  source,  this  paper  reviews  the  past/recent  achieve-
ments and future ideas about all types of HDH desalination sys-
tems to improve their performance. Therefore, the present paper
provides an inclusive review on experimental and theoretical de-
velopments carried out for performance improvement of HDH pro-
cesses. HDH systems integrating with renewable and electrical en-
ergy sources are reviewed. Using fossil fuels in HDH system is out-
dated  while  operating  the  system  with  electrical  energy  is  rare.
Few studies that used electricity for air or water heating are re-
ported  in  manuscript.  This  paper  focuses  exclusively  on  the  uti-
lization of renewable energies, ME-HDH and MS-HDH plants, in-
tegration with other desalination technologies, utilization of vari-

able pressure humidification-dehumidification (VP-HDH), coupling
of  heat  pump  to  humidification-dehumidification  (HP-HDH),  and
modification of the main components in any HDH system. Thermo-
dynamic studies, exergy analysis, introducing the basic equations
for HDH modeling and techno-economical study of large scale HDH
systems  are  reported  in  this  study,  which  are  commonly  over-
looked in earlier reviews. It is also attempted to cover all designs
of HDH system to illustrate an in-depth review by not centraliz-
ing on renewable energy. The effect of several parameters such as
the working fluids flow rates and temperatures, brine recirculation,
ambient temperature, humidifier design and dehumidifier design
on the system performance are discussed.

2. Performance analysis of humidification-dehumidification
desalination systems

To  achieve higher desalination rate together with less energy
consumption, conventional HDH systems can be modified by using
renewable energy sources, variable pressure HDH process, coupling
HDH  to  other  desalination  systems,  improving  the  main  compo-
nents and designing the HDH-HP units. In this way, process cost
and cost per liter (CPL) values can be decreased. The main perfor-
mance parameters for system evaluation are gained output ratio
(GOR) and performance ratio (PR) [33] .

and required electrical energy for operating the electrical devices
(i.e. pumps, fan, compressor, electrical heaters, etc.).

HDH systems are compared in terms of specific electrical en-
ergy  consumption  (SEEC)  which  compares  the  desalination  rate
and input electrical energy as:

(3)

SE E C =

 ̇ m pw
 ̇ W in
where,   ̇ m pw  and   ̇ W
in  are desalination rate and required electrical
ergy for running the electrical devices, respectively. It is clear that
the  system  performance  improves  when  producing  more  desali-
nated water while using less electrical energy. Economic analysis of
desalination methods significantly influences their application. The
fixed capital cost, running and maintenance costs, salvage value,
interest rate and water production rate during lifespan are consid-
ered.

Note that the performance parameters obtained through experi-
mental or theoretical study evaluate the system without paying at-
tention to the energy loss from the system by the process or com-
ponents.  Therefore,  the  performance  evaluation  is  completed  by
conducting exergy analysis (the energy that is available to be used)
on these systems. The exergy of a system refers to the maximum
useful  work  possible  during  a  process  that  approaches  the  sys-
tem into equilibrium using a heat reservoir. When the surround-
ing is the reservoir, exergy is the potential of a system to cause
a change as it reaches equilibrium with its environment. In con-
trast to energy that is always conserved during a process, exergy
is  destroyed  when  a  process  involves  pressure,  temperature  and
humidity changes. The destruction is proportional to the entropy
generation of the system as well as its surroundings. The exergy
efficiency  states  that  part  of  the  exergy  entering  a  system  with
electricity, fuel, and flowing stream of matter is destroyed due to
irreversibility.

The exergy rate balance for a control volume (an HDH system)
in steady state condition and by negating the potential and kinetic
energies is written in the following general form:

of dry air and water). Normally, the dead state is humid air at at-

Due  to  the  thermodynamic  irreversibility  through  any  opera-
tion, the lower exergy efficiency of a process indicates the degra-
dation of different energies.

Another valuable method for evaluating the desalination units
is  the  exergoeconomic  analysis.  This  combines  exergy  and  cost
analyses by calculating the exergetic and the financial cost of each
stream. Cost balance equation is formulated for each component of
the system. Exergoeconomic cost balances present the cost of all
resources entering a component (either in the form of cost related
with the exergy flows entering the component or capital cost) with
those exiting the same component. The general equations of com-
ponents are expressed as [37] :

Overall,  it  should  be  noted  that  achieving  higher  GOR,  PR
and  exergy  efficiency,  lower  water  cost  is  obtained.  This  can  be
achieved by designing high efficiency components and optimizing
the  operating  parameters  (inlet  air  and  water  temperatures  and
their mass flow rates).

3. Comparison of different humidification-dehumidification
desalination systems based on performance parameters

Table 1 presents a summary of the literature in terms of the
performance  parameters  (e.g.,  maximum  GOR  and  productivity,
minimum SEEC and desalinated water cost) of various HDH sys-
tems.  Their  component  characteristics  (e.g.,  size  and  type)  and
stream  features  (e.g.,  maximum  air  and  water  temperatures  ( T a
and T sw ), water to air flow rate ratio ( w/a ), top brine temperature
(TBT)) are also revealed. This table proves that performance of a
conventional HDH system can be improved by using varied pres-
sure, multi-effect and multi-stage processes as well as injection-
extraction  technology.  Applying  these  modifications,  the  air  ap-
proaches  its  saturation  state  or  humidifier  and  dehumidifier  are
thermodynamically balanced, improving the system performance.
The main observations from Table 1 include:

- ME-HDH  systems  outperform  among  HDH  systems  due  to
the  highest  heat  recovery.  Whenever  an  efficient  solar  wa-
ter  heater  (SWH)  is  used  and  the  inlet  saline  water  temper-
ature  is  increased,  the  GOR  increases.  An  HDH  system  using
the extraction-injection technology that follows the multi-effect
concept has an acceptable performance compared to the one
without extraction-injection due to utilization of the thermo-
dynamic  balance  between  humidifier and  dehumidifier.  Mini-
mizing the difference between the air temperatures at its injec-
tion and extraction points (decreasing the entropy generation
leading  to  less  energy  loss)  is  a  great  strategy  for  improving
the ME-HDH system performance (systems presented in Table
1 , rows 1 to 4).

- MS-HDH systems get the next ranking in terms of performance
among other types of HDH units. Through multi-stage humidi-
fication, the leaving air from the humidifier saturates and the
production  rate  increases  without  using  extra  energy  input.
Multi-stage humidification, heat recovery, utilization of renew-
able energy and increasing the input fluid temperature enhance
the performance of these systems. In an ultrasonic assisted hu-
midifier, elimination of surface tension by ultrasound as well as
accelerating evaporation rate is achieved (systems presented in
Table 1 , rows 5 to 9).

- VP-HDH  using  both  over-atmospheric  pressure  dehumidifica-
tion  and  sub-atmospheric  pressure  humidification  approaches
reinforces the dehumidification and humidification operations.
In a VP-HDH system where the vacuum is created by baromet-
ric head, no vacuum pump is used, augmenting the GOR. The
VHDH technology is ranked next in terms of operation due to
using liquid ring vacuum pump (LRVP). Obviously, by moving
away from the environmental state in VP-HDH systems, the ex-
ergy efficiency decreases. In VP-HDH systems, the highest irre-
versibility is imposed to the system to increase the dehumid-
ifier  pressure  or  decrease  the  humidifier  pressure,  leading  to
a reduction in exergy efficiency (systems presented in Table 1 ,
rows 10 to 13).

- Zero brine HDH systems eliminate the requirement for contin-
uous energy supply, resulting in higher GOR. HDH systems us-
ing a desiccant-based air dryer or a liquid desiccant solution
instead of saline water are other options for heat recovery, in-
creasing the GOR. In zero brine HDH, using an HP can enhance
the  performance  (systems  presented  in  Table  1 ,  rows  14  and
15).

- Pulsation water spraying in the humidifier increases the resi-
dence time of water in humidifier, compensating the low water
holdup owing to the loose packing flow; hence the system GOR
is improved compared to a conventional HDH. In HDH systems
with high energy input and constant desalination rate, the GOR
decreases ( Table 1 , systems 16 and 17).

- In HDH systems coupled to an HP or MVC, which recover the
energy from their evaporator/condenser or compressor, the sys-
tems performance is improved ( Table 1 , systems 18- 20).

- Coupling the system to a flashing system or solar pond, OACW
and OAOW cycles, and using double pass solar air heater out-
perform single effect HDH, OAOW and CAOW cycles. It is due
to enhancing the heating recovery, decreasing the irreversibil-
ity and using an efficient heater. Since the impact of air tem-
perature on system productivity is insignificant, designing the
water heated HDH and brine recirculation would lead to higher
GOR compared to air-heated or dual-heated HDH. In OAOW cy-
cles, higher irreversibility is imposed compared to CAOW cy-
cles;  therefore,  brine  recirculation  would  lead  to  higher  pro-
ductivity  and  GOR.  Conventional  CAOW  systems  should  be
modified  to  implement  heat  recovery  (see  Table  1 ,  systems
21-29).

In summary, the HDH system performance can be improved us-
ing multi-effect and multi-stage designs, multi extraction-injection
technology,  and  operation  at  different  pressure  with  low  energy
consuming devices, coupling to HP or solar pond, using renewable
energy through a high efficient heater.

4. Thermodynamic study based on exergy analysis

A highly efficient process can be achieved with energy-exergy
considerations. Combination of thermodynamic laws leads to en-
hancement in the quality of processes and maximize the produced
system work as it is brought into equilibrium with the reference
state. Recently, thermal systems have been analyzed using these
laws. The energy balance provides valuable information about the
state of the system concerning the losses from the unit. It does
not present any difference between the energy types, nor does it
reflect the losses due to a reduction in energy quality.

The  overall  mass  and  energy  balance  equations,  specific  en-
thalpy  of  humid  air,  water  vapor  pressure,  specific  enthalpies of
saline  water  and  desalinated  pure  water  are  presented  through
Eqs. (17) to ( 23 ), respectively [ 38 , 65 ].

sink-source concept was applied while considering a change in the
concentration of humid air. The results revealed that mass trans-
fer  does  not  affect  the  exergy  loss,  while  heat  transfer  imposed
high irreversibility to the system. Heaters having the largest irre-
versibility caused a reduction in the exergy efficiency of the HDH
system. The exergy loss was compared for AH-HDH and WH-HDH
systems. High irreversibility was concluded for the WH-HDH de-
sign  at  low  inlet  water  temperature  into  the  humidifier.  The  air
leaving the dehumidifier and humidifier was considered saturated.
In reality, these streams may not be saturated due to inefficiencies
of the components. This caused a large discrepancy between theo-
retical and experimental results.

An exergetical analysis of a solar assisted AH-HDH plant was
conducted by Nematollahi et al. [69] . By designing a proper hu-
midifier (0.2ID × 2 m), maximum productivity as well as overall
exergy  efficiency  was  achieved.  Energy  balances  for  moisture  as
well as liquid and gas streams predicted the humidifier behavior in
an accurate manner. The overall exergy efficiency was increased by
a reduction in humidifier length and inlet air temperature, and an
increase in humidifier diameter. At a certain humidifier length, the
air was saturated; therefore, beyond this length no further change
was observed in the overall exergy efficiency. In solar HDH studies,
the ambient temperature and air absolute humidity change; how-
ever, the dead state is considered a constant value. As these pa-
rameters affect the chemical exergy, selecting a proper dead state
may lead to more reliable results [70] .

The performance of dehumidifiers in an MS-HDH was evaluated
by Chiranjeevi and Srinivas [71] . Dehumidification was conducted
in two stages through normal and chilled cooling water. Maximum
exergy efficiency was deduced in the first dehumidifier having an
exergy loss of 0.0 6 6 kW. Increasing the water flow rate, the exergy
efficiency was increased. The optimum values of inlet water and
air cooling temperatures were obtained in the ranges of 25-32  ̊C
and 13-25  ̊C, respectively for normal and chilled water. Parametric
study through exergy analysis was the strength of this study while
neglecting the chemical exergy can be considered as the weakness.

Optimization by using the optimization software after determina-
tion of main parameters through parametric study should be con-
sidered in future work.

The exergetic efficiencies of the components in an WH-ME-HDH
unit was determined based on the outlet air temperature from the
humidifier, a/w ratio, salinity, solar intensity, cooling water temper-
ature and mass flow rate, and irradiance [72] . The results indicated
that the exergy efficiency of both dehumidifier and humidifier in-
creased by increasing the a/w ratio. It was due to an increase in the
input exergy of streams. The humidifier and dehumidifier exergy
efficiencies were improved by reducing and increasing the inlet air
temperature, respectively. It was due to the reduction and increase
in exergy destruction at high temperatures considering their con-
ceptual performances. This study would be completed by develop-
ing the pinch technology. The liberated energy from the compo-
nents can be used for heating the process fluids, leading to a high
energy recovery.

An AH-HDH system containing a solar air heater equipped with
three  insert  types  of  twisted  tape,  conical  turbulator  and  half-
perforated circular were tested. The pitch ratios of 3, 4 and 5 were
examined to improve the heat transfer rate in the solar air heater.
The sawdust and gunny bag packings were used within the humid-
ifier to enhance the mass transfer rate. In addition, spring insert
with pitch ratios of 3 and 4 was also used in the dehumidifier to
increase the overall heat transfer coefficient. In comparison with a
conventional HDH, using air heater with the twisted tape insert by
pitch ratio of 3, the gunny bag in the humidifier and the spring
inserts in the dehumidifier with a pitch ratio of 3 increased the
productivity, energy and exergy efficiencies by about 100%, 120%
and 150%, respectively, [73] . A detailed thermodynamic analysis by
considering all effective process parameters will optimize the pro-
cess and increase energy recovery.

The performance of a co-generation unit based on a combina-
tion of AH-HDH with concentrated photovoltaic-thermal collectors
was  evaluated  by  Elsafi [37] .  Microscopic  modeling,  using  the
photovoltaic-thermal  module,  exergoeconomic  analysis  as  well
as  consideration  of  salinity  variation  in  brine  and  pure  water
contribute  to  in-depth  performance  analysis.  More  descriptions
about the performance of photovoltaic-thermal module and using
the  pinch  technology  are  required  for  the  proposed  system.  The
outcomes showed that the system would be able to produce 12
m 3  of  desalinated  water  and  960  kWh  of  electricity  per  year.
The  unit  cost  for  electrical  power  generation  and  desalination
rate  was  assessed  as  $0.289  /kWh  and  $0.01  /L,  respectively.
Using  the  produced  electrical  and  thermal  energies  from  the
photovoltaic-thermal module for heating the process fluids or op-
erating the electrical components will enhance the overall system
performance.

Energy, exergy, economic and environmental analysis of air and
WH-HDH-PV  plant  was  conducted  by  Deniz  and  Çınar  [74] .  The
maximum daily energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed sys-
tem were estimated as about 31.5% and 1.9%, respectively. The most
exergy efficient operation time for their system was from 1:00 PM
to  6:00  PM,  due  to  the  high  energy  storage  during  this  time  in
components. The desalination rate, CPL and enviro-economic pa-
rameter  of  about  1.12  L/h,  $0.099  and  $2.404/annum  were  con-
cluded.  The  exergy  efficiency  of  the  PV  panel  decreased  during
the daytime due to its back surface temperature increase, which
was  influenced  by  the  solar  intensity  and  ambient  temperature.
The air temperature varied from 28.2 °C to 37.6 °C while its rel-
ative humidity varied in the range of 21% to 59%. These variations
contribute to select a proper dead state, which in turn affects the
chemical exergy and overall exergy efficiency.

Since  exergy  destruction  is  related  to  the  entropy  genera-
tion,  it  is  expected  that  maximizing  exergy  efficiency  would
lead  to  minimum  specific  entropy  generation,  and  consequently,

the  minimum  required  heat  of  separation.  The  entropy  is  gen-
erated  by  discharged  streams  due  to  the  variation  of  their
states  from  the  run  down  to  the  equilibrium  state.  There  have
been  limited  studies  in  this  filed  which  are  summarized  in  this
section.

The  entropy  analysis  of  an  HDH  cycle  based  on  minimizing
the specific entropy generation could improve the performance of
the  components  [75] .  The  results  revealed  that  GOR  maximiza-
tion  is  directly  dependent  upon  minimizing  the  entropy  genera-
tion.  At  a  constant  value  of  w/a  ratio,  minimum  generated  en-
tropy  and  maximum  GOR  were  concluded.  It  was  shown  that
each  cycle  had  one  limiting  component  that  could  not  be  con-
siderably upgraded and a second component, which was the tar-
get of struggles to lower the generated entropy. The exergy anal-
ysis failed to make decisive results for the on-design HDH cycle.
Entropy generation analysis illustrates the effect of irreversibility
on the minimum input energy required for the separation of salt
from the saline water. The aim of the study conducted by Karan
et  al.  [76]  was  evaluating  the  minimum  work  of  separation  to
produce freshwater, not hot freshwater. Irreversibility was created
due to the lost work, mixing the brine with saline water in the
dead state and temperature disequilibrium of the discharge stream.
Among different studied desalination technologies (i.e. MEH, MSF,
MD, RO and HDH), thermal disequilibrium of the discharge stream
accounted  for  a  considerable  portion  of  the  entropy  generation
and chemical disequilibrium was important in technologies with
high  recovery  ratio.  It  was  also  concluded  that  electrical  energy
was  a  high-grade  energy  source  compared  to  thermal  energy,
and  extra  entropy  can  be  generated  while  converting  from  the
thermal to electrical energies. The lack of information about en-
tropy  generation  in  renewable-energy  driven  HDH  processes  are
observed.

In  summary,  investigation  on  the  HDH  process  based  on  the
second law of the thermodynamic concept is one of the methods
contributing  to  enhancement  in  HDH  performance.  The  systems
can be analyzed by developing the macroscopic or microscopic en-
ergy and mass conservation equations. Change in concentration of
vapor in humid air, components’ sizes and their energetical perfor-
mances (heat transfer and loss), input thermal and electrical en-
ergies and flow rates in components are the parameters that af-
fect the system performance thermodynamically. All actions (e.g.,
increasing the temperature of process fluids in the humidifier, de-
creasing the temperature of circulating water in the dehumidifier,
insolation of the components, modification of heaters by using the
insert, optimization of the fluids mass flow rates and using pinch
technology in multi-effect processes) leading to increasing the en-
ergy efficiency, reducing the irreversibility and input energy for op-
eration are highly recommended. Further research will be required
by synchronous consideration of the parameter optimization, us-
ing high-efficient components and pinch technology to make the
HDH systems comparable through revealing the overall exergy of
the system.

5. Design improvement of humidification-dehumidification
systems

Conventional HDH process that was invented during the early
1960s  had  limitations  in  terms  of  its  dependence  on  the  stabil-
ity of the hot and cold sources. Several modifications have been
presented, and the system performance has been evaluated. The
limited  supply  of  non-renewable  global  energy  caused  the  fossil
fuel  assisted  HDH to  be  substituted  with  the  renewable energy-
assisted ones. Due to operating at low temperatures, utilization of
solar, geothermal and waste heat sources lead to the modification
of HDH systems [77] .

5.1. Components design improvement

5.1.1. The humidifier designs

The  humidifier  as  one  of  the  main  components  of  HDH  sys-
tems  must  be  well  designed  to  ensure  outlet  air  saturation  and
size minimization. It can be the ultrasonic humidifier, packed bed
with different packing materials, bubble column or spray tower. All
these  designs  have  been  proposed  to  augment  the  contact  time
and mass/heat transfer rates. It should be noted that spraying of
salty water within the humidifier leads to water accumulation on
packings or blocking the holes in bubble column or sprayer noz-
zles. Due to the difficulty of cleaning and its subsequent increase
in maintenance cost, the heat/mass transfer coefficients gradually
decrease.

Design  equations  of  a  packed  bed  humidifier  are  reported  as
follows. The humidifier is discretized as shown in Fig. 2 . The mass
and energy balance equations for each element along the humidi-
fier are solved simultaneously [78] .

In  this  element,  the  entering  air  stream  absorbs  water  vapor
and the resulting humid air is discharged from the element. The
governing mass and energy equations for this element are:

To ensure high-energy efficiency, the packing material should

be properly selected.

Parametric study of a WH-HDH system containing corrugated
packing  aluminum  sheets  within  the  humidifier  (cross-sectional
area of 0.65 × 0.65 m 2 , packing height of 0.65 m) was investigated
by Ahmed et al. [79] . The corrugated type was proposed due to its
higher surface area for contacting the process fluids than the hon-
eycomb type (cellulosic paper), longer contact time between the
fluids was achieved, leading to high mass and heat transfer rates
and low pressure-drop in the humidifier. The results indicated that
increasing the water temperature and water flow rate significantly
increased productivity. However, a slight increase in productivity
was obtained by increasing the air temperature. It was also con-
cluded that a specific air flow rate could achieve maximum pro-
ductivity. Type of the energy source and heating device affect the
feed water temperature, productivity and production cost. It is rec-
ommended to analyze the system based on selecting the type of
energy source and GOR rather than productivity.

Yanniotis  and  Xerodemas  investigated  the  performance  of  a
tubular spray (humidifier size: 0.3 ID × 4 m) and a pad packing
(cross-sectional area of 0.45 × 0.55 m 2 , thickness of 0.10 m). It was
shown that the productivities of the spray type and pad type hu-
midifiers by 100 mm thickness were the same, while pad packing
with 300 mm thickness had a high evaporation rate (productivity)
at high air to water ( a/w ) ratios [80] . The paper can be extended
by conducting CFD simulation and parametric study.

A  WH-HDH  containing  compact  light-weight  humidifier  with
high  effectiveness  and  low  electric  energy  consumption  was  in-
vestigated by Zeng et al. [81] . The fluids flowed within a humid-
ifier containing an array of vertically aligned strings with an in-
ner diameter of 6.35 cm for airflow. That humidifier type with TBT
of about 50 °C enhanced the heat and mass exchange effectiveness
due to its high specific area. The proposed humidifier augmented
the evaporation rate by five times compared with packed bed and
spray tower. The pressure drop was decreased due to the straight
gas flow paths. The process optimization and GOR determination
would be useful for proving the superiority of the newly developed
design.

An  HDH  consisting  of  an  evacuated  tube  solar  water  heater,
membrane humidifier (area of 0.59 m 2 ), and fin-and-tube heat ex-
changer (42 tubes with outer diameter of 9.52 mm) was simulated
by Li and Zhang [82] . The hollow fiber membrane used in the pro-
posed humidifier met the standard requirements for drinking wa-
ter. The parallel-plates channel and ε-NTU models were found suc-
cessful tools to simulate the humidifier containing the crossflow
hollow fiber membrane and fin-and-tube heat exchanger, respec-
tively. The maximum desalination rate and minimum SEEC were
achieved using a packing fraction of 30%. The membrane humidi-
fier was introduced as a substitute for usual humidifiers. The SEEC
shows the superiority of this type of humidifier that requires fur-
ther clarification of the humidification mechanism. The tempera-
ture  limitation  and  fouling  effects  should  be  considered  in  HDH
systems integrated with membrane humidifiers.

Entropy minimization of a packed bed humidifier (0.5 ID × 1.5
m, TBT of 46.07 °C and feed water temperature of 80 °C) in a WH-
HDH plant was briefly described by Maximus Gladstone [83] . The

number of packing blocks considered in the humidifier affected its
performance. It was reported that the effectiveness of humidifier,
as well as enthalpy and temperature pinches mainly affect entropy
generation. The heat capacity ratio (HCR) balancing introduced a
design optimization method that was extended to an HDH system
featuring humid air extraction from the humidifier and its injec-
tion to the tube plate dehumidifier (heat transfer area of 8 m 2 ).
Mass extraction let systematic balancing of the humidifier and de-
humidifier, which led to superior freshwater production. Optimiza-
tion of an extraction-injection assisted HDH system via minimizing
the entropy generation can be the subject of future research.

A solar multi-stage bubble column humidifier (cross sectional
area  of  0.3  × 0.3  m 2 )  was  designed  to  determine  the  pressure
drop inside the humidifier, the absolute humidity at different wa-
ter heights in the solar humidifier and superficial air velocity [84] .
One of the major challenges in the investigation of the proposed
bubble  column  humidifier  was  the  optimization  of  the  geomet-
ric  features of  the perforated plates.  Although  the larger diame-
ter  of  holes  and  higher  open  area  ratio  led  to  the  lower  pres-
sure drop, they caused leakage. Accordingly, optimum values were
determined for holes diameter and open area ratio. The absolute
humidity increased exponentially while increasing water tempera-
ture. The water column with a height of 1 cm and an air veloc-
ity of 0.25 m/s provided the best humidifier performance. Com-
pared to a single-stage humidifier, the two and three-stage ones
achieved maximum improvements of about 9% and 21% in terms
of absolute humidity. Using concentrating or evacuated solar col-
lectors or other available renewable energies for heating the water
would increase the evaporation rate, which was not considered in
this work. Moreover, nanoparticles can be used in humidifiers in
future experimental and theoretical studies.

An integrated Maisotsenko cycle-based air saturator was pro-
posed as the humidifier [85] . The airflow in the wet channel was
changed by an infiltration flow from the dry to the wet passes of
the humidifier. An infiltration rate of 0.6 was reported to have the
highest evaporation rate as well as blower and pump works. Com-
pared to an HDH system with direct contact humidifier, the pro-
posed system offered 30% and 11% higher productivity and GOR,
respectively. Furthermore, 14% and 7% lower cost and carbon foot-
print proved the cost-effective and environmentally friendly tech-
nology  of  the  proposed  system  in  comparison  with  the  conven-
tional HDH. Maximum GOR of 0.57 encourages modification of the
proposed unit.

An ultrasonic humidifier (1 m length, 0.6 m width and 0.02 m
height) can be applied in a WH-HDH system due to its availability
and economy [86] . Ultrasonic vibrations provide atomizing force,
dispersing fine water droplets into the airflow [87] . An ultrasonic
humidifier with 30 W energy consumption which emitted water
vapor into an indoor environment was investigated by Feng et al.
[86] . First, the indoor air was mixed with water droplets, then, the
humid air was injected into the indoor environment (air outlet),
as shown in Fig. 3 . The indoor ultrasonic humidifier saved 70% of
energy and 18% of exergy loss in comparison to the conventional
steam humidification process. The partial evaporation and energy
loss in the form of the latent heat of vaporization caused the ex-
ergy loss. The qualitative characteristics of the proposed humidi-
fier facilitated indoor humidity control in the perspectives of ther-
mal comfort and human health. Energy generation by ultrasound
frequency variation is one of the main parameters that should be
considered. Moreover, the separation of salt from water vapor for
ultrasonic humidifiers is rather complex which needs further re-
search.

In  summary,  hydrodynamic  of  humidifier  (type,  size,  packing
shape and material) and the characteristics of the inlet streams, af-
fect the HDH performance. The main goals are the maximization of
the contact time between the water and air, process temperature

help the decision-making process for using the desiccant dehumid-
ifiers.

A 2D model of a plate-fin tube heat exchanger in a WH-HDH
system was developed by Sievers and Lienhard [90] . The tube di-
ameters as well as the diagonal and longitudinal tube spacing were
optimized  as  design  parameters  to  enhance  the  heat  flow  at  a
constant  quantity  of  fin  material.  An  increase  in  the  tube  spac-
ing  above  an  assured  value  reduced  the  heat  flow.  By  increas-
ing the tube diameter, the thermal conductive resistance from the
fin surface to inner tube surface was reduced. Using thicker fins
were  recommended  due  to  their  less  thermal  conductive  resis-
tance, which improved the dehumidifier performance. It was pre-
sented that smaller transverse tube spacing led to greater pressure
drop. The performance comparison of plate-fine tube dehumidifier
and other direct or indirect dehumidifiers could be helpful in se-
lecting the best type of dehumidifier for HDH processes.

A multi-stage bubble column dehumidifier containing two sizes
of cooling coils was experimented in an HDH system by Tow and
Lienhard  [91] .  Experimental  results  were  presented  in  terms  of
heat flux and effectiveness to introduce the effective parameters
influencing the bubble column dehumidifier performance. It was
concluded that the heat flux dramatically increased when decreas-
ing the coil area and air temperature, while the dehumidifier ef-
fectiveness decreased. It was recommended that the liquid height
should be decreased to increase the gas-side pressure drop.

The over-atmospheric pressure in a bubble column dehumidi-
fier was modeled by Sharqawy and Liu [92] . The dependency of
bubble column effectiveness to the number of transfer units and
pressure on heat and mass transfer coefficients were recognized.
It  was  concluded  that  the  heat  transfer  improved  while  the  ef-
fectiveness was decreased by an increase in pressure. By using a
large  size  dehumidifier  at  over-atmospheric  pressure,  the  reduc-
tion in effectiveness was compensated. Huang [93] proposed the
implementation of a multi-stage bubble column dehumidifier for
full extraction of water vapor from the carrier gas. The effective-
ness of the dehumidifier was maximized by maximization of the
accessible space through multi-staging dehumidification which re-
covered as much energy as possible for preheating the feed saline
water [94] . Due to the superiority of bubble column dehumidifiers
over the film condensation regime in indirect dehumidifiers, the
former can be a proper option for HDH systems. The airflow rate
creating the bubbles in the dehumidifier and its temperature at the
inlet were determinative factors for the dehumidifier effectiveness
and size.

A solar HDH system with subsurface condensation technology
was thermodynamically analyzed by Okati et al. [95] . Subsurface
dehumidification was introduced as a promising strategy for un-
derground irrigation. The outlet humid air entered an underground
condensation space where its temperature was decreased by trans-
ferring its thermal energy to the buried tubes. Therefore, conden-
sation occurred, producing desalinated water. The results indicated
that the productivity reached values beyond 265 L/d. In another
research, they applied a solar humidifier and a set of tubes as the
subsurface condenser [96] . The amount of freshwater per length of
tube buried underground was 3.8 L/m.h. Considering an HDH sys-
tem with a high concentrating solar collector, using phase change
material and subsurface condenser can achieve high efficiency.

A helical coil heat exchanger was used to improve the efficiency
of the dehumidifier in a WH-HDH system [97] . Maximum produc-
tivity was reported at the optimum diameter of the dehumidifier
(i.e. 10 mm). Increasing the coil pitch (from 1 to 5) produced more
condensate. It was due to the fact that the humid air could occupy
the spaces within the coil turns, increasing the effective area for
heat transfer. The paper did not clarify the characteristics of in-
let water and humid air to evaluate the dehumidifier performance.

for humidification, providing the proper mass flow rate of the flu-
ids and minimization of the pressure drop within the humidifier.
These actions improve the heat and mass transfer coefficient and
exchange effectiveness, leading to high productivity and low en-
tropy generation. Experimental, theoretical and simulation scenar-
ios contribute to paving the ways for researchers to industrialize
the HDH process. Furthermore, multi-stage humidification and us-
ing energy recovery through the extraction-injection strategy will
improve the system performance. Limitation of using different in-
troduced humidifiers should be considered to achieve design im-
provement.

5.1.2. The dehumidifier designs

The airside and saline waterside energy balance equations in a

dehumidifier are:

d  ̇ Q =   ̇ m

da d h a + d (  ̇ m pw d h pw )

where , d  ̇ m pw = −  ̇ m w d w a

An HDH system using injected air through a liquid desiccant so-
lution (CaCl
2 ) was investigated by Kabeel [88] . The liquid desiccant
dehumidifier was evidenced to be an active method to extract the
moisture from humid air with relatively less energy consumption.
The air was flowed through the desiccant liquid at various airflow
rates, solution levels and regeneration temperatures. At the opti-
mum airflow rate and solution level, humidifier and dehumidifier
effectiveness values of 0.92 and 0.87 were obtained, respectively.
The heat and mass transfer characteristics in terms of the Nusselt
(Nu) and Sherwood (Sh) numbers of an HDH system with honey-
comb desiccant dehumidifier (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 m 3 ) were investi-
gated by Yaningsih et al. [89] . It was claimed that adding or elimi-
nating heat and moisture depends on the heat/mass transfer char-
acteristics. Higher desorption rate showed higher ability for mois-
ture removal. For continuous operation of the proposed system, the
switching time (i.e. the time interval for adsorption and desorption
processes) varied. The results revealed that the Nu and Sh numbers
are more influenced by the adsorption temperature than switching
time. Minimum desorption temperature resulted in maximum Nu
and Sh numbers. In OAOW cycles, the humidifier and dehumidifier
performances will change in different locations with different hu-
midity ratios, which should be considered during the design phase.
Calculation of the system performance based on GOR and cost can

The optimum values of coil diameter and pitch in exchange of HDH
capacity should be determined.

In summary, different direct and indirect designs of the heat ex-
changers (e.g., plate-fin tube heat exchanger, helical coil, and bub-
ble column, subsurface and desiccant types) have been investigated
to augment the dehumidification process, leading to improvement
in HDH performance. It should be noted that non-effective dehu-
midifier worsens the humidifier performance. Decreasing the water
temperature entering the dehumidifier and increasing its flow rate
beyond a certain value, increasing the heat exchange area through
designing an efficient dehumidifier with reduced size and using a
proper liquid desiccant solution with an optimum level and dehu-
midifier operation in over-atmospheric pressure could improve the
effectiveness of the dehumidifier. The best choice of the dehumid-
ifier can be selected whenever the performance parameters (e.g.,
GOR, SEEC, PR and production cost) be revealed in papers.

5.2. Renewable energy driven humidification-dehumidification
desalination systems

The HDH principle using different energy sources have under-
gone considerable progress over the recent years owing to the in-
novative experiments and theoretical studies that are summarized
in the following sections.

5.2.1. Solar-assisted humidification-dehumidification desalination
system

Many studies have been conducted to address the energy de-
mand  challenges  using  solar  desalination  plants.  Among  various
solar driven desalination units, HDH systems received great atten-
tion due to their advantages in design and application. Coastal ar-
eas with high solar insolation and low freshwater availability have
a  great  potential  for  this  technology.  Solar  energy  as  the  most
abundantly available energy resource (in many countries) can be
employed to run the HDH systems. Flat plate [98] , evacuated tube
[99] solar collectors and Fresnel lens [100] concentrators are the
options to be connected to the HDH plant to provide the required
thermal energy. Progressive steps in design improvement lead to
providing high top water and air temperatures. These efforts have
been  made  to  improve  the  evaporation  driving  force,  decreasing
the humidity ratio and hence, increasing the potential of the de-
humidification. Parametric studies on HDH systems integrated with
solar collectors generally reveal that the collector tilt angle is the
main  parameter  affecting  the  amount  of  freshwater  production.
The maximum freshwater would be obtained when the tilt angle
is approximately adjusted to the latitude angle [24] . It has been
found  that  the  system  productivity  reaches  its  maximum  in  hot
days  of  the  year,  which  benefits  from  maximum  solar  radiation
[101] .  The  system  efficiency  improves  significantly  provided  that
the saline water enters with high temperature into the humidifier
(providing maximum process water temperature), while using an
optimal w/a . The optimum w/a value is selected by the thermal ef-
ficiency of the heating source [102] . In RO, MD and AD desalination
plants,  the  temperature  should  be  limited  to  preserve  the  plant
from scale formation. As HDH systems are not sensitive to salinity,
they do not have such limitation. In HDH processes, by increasing
the feed water temperature the evaporation driving force improves,
enhancing productivity. Fluctuation in the amount of daily water
production due to variation in solar irradiance necessitates using a
storage system (e.g. a battery to store PV energy or coupling with
other energy sources) [103] . It is one of the main drawbacks of us-
ing solar energy in solar-driven HDH systems.

Flat plate type solar air and water heaters have been employed
in the HDH process, and their effect on system performance was
analyzed.  An  HDH  unit  equipped  with  a  double-pass  solar  air

heater  with  two  glass  covers  was  modeled  by  Yamali  and  Sol-
mus [98] based on the OACW cycle. The performance of the AH-
HDH  system  was  improved  up  to  8%  using  the  double-pass  so-
lar  air  heater  compared  to  a  single-pass  one,  due  to  increasing
the top process air temperature. Furthermore, eliminating the solar
air heater, the productivity was decreased by 30% under the same
operating  conditions.  An  optimum  value  of  airflow  rate  was  de-
termined to maximize the productivity. The effect of wind speed
on the productivity was higher in the one pass air configuration
than  double  pass  due  to  the  cooling  of  the  surfaces  and  work-
ing  fluid.  Double-glazing  and  one-glazing  designs  and  sensitivity
to material properties of a solar air heater structure were investi-
gated by Summers et al. [104] . Solar absorptivity of the absorber
and  transmissivity  of  the  glass  were  found  to  have  a  significant
influence on the system performance. Double-glazing and rough-
ened absorber plates were recommended to excel heat transfer to
the airstream. The collector in the proposed design performed bet-
ter than the one-glazing type by 58% at 0.06 kW/m 2  gain. A so-
lar assisted HDH system was investigated by Nafey et al. [ 105 , 106 ].
A brass tube surrounded by a double glass transparent envelope
was used as the solar water heater (concentrated solar collector
type). A single-pass flat plate collector (FPC) was used to heat the
air in the system. It was found that the variation in ambient tem-
perature and wind speed had an insignificant influence on the pro-
ductivity. Siddiqui et al. [107] proposed solar and electrical power
AH-HDH systems. The values of GOR, SEEC and CPL showed the ac-
ceptable performance of the HDH powered with solar heater com-
pared  to  the  electrical  heater  (input  energy  of  500  W).  The  re-
sults revealed that at a special air mass flow rate (i.e., less than
0.017 kg/s) the productivity trend changed and consequently the
optimum value of 0.034 kg/s was obtained. Despite the possibil-
ity of running the system for 24 hours when using electrical en-
ergy, its performance parameters were less than the SAH-HDH. It
was due to the high energy consumption and low inlet air tem-
perature  into  the  humidifier.  An  AH-ME-HDH  technique  was  in-
vestigated  by  Houcine  et  al.  [108] .  Four-fold-web-plate  solar  air
heaters  were  used  at  different  stages.  The  desalination  rate  was
optimized for the four stage heating-humidifying process. Due to
the polycarbonate-plates deformation, collectors’ tightness of 0.6 m
was considered, and continuous air circulation was recommended.
The freshwater production reached the value of 355 kg/d during
August. A dynamic mathematical model of flat plate collectors for
air and water heating, having areas of 16 m 2 and 12 m 2 , was devel-
oped to predict the behavior of solar collectors in an HDH system
[109] . Considering the difference between the water and absorber
temperatures, the two-temperature theory was developed. This led
to more accurate results than the one-temperature model in terms
of predicting the behavior and size of collectors. The flat plate type
collector is the first version of the solar collectors that has been
mostly used in HDH processes. For maximizing the water or air
temperature, it needs larger area than other solar collectors. The
multiple pass is an option for compensating the large area require-
ment and increasing the thermal efficiency. Evacuating the distance
between the two glasses in the double-glazing design can reduce
the heat loss, leading to high performance. As increasing the air
temperature has insignificant effect on HDH productivity (due to
its low heat capacity), using a water heater is recommended. Fur-
thermore, placing the air heater after humidifier can be another
progressive step for increasing the dehumidifier performance and
heat recovery in HDH systems. This configuration provides hot air
at the inlet of the dehumidifier or contributes to an increase in
cooling water flow rate, leading to preheating the saline water up
to higher temperatures (low collector area) or improving the dehu-
midifier efficiency (low heat exchanger area).

A WH-HDH system incorporated with a heat pipe design solar
evacuated tube collector was optimized at different geographical

locations by Zubair et al. [110] . The effect of the number of collec-
tors on productivity and CPL was studied. The maximum perfor-
mance was found at a geographical location with the highest solar
intensity. It was revealed that the results depended on variables
such as the tilt angle, time, month of the year and collector cover
characteristics (transmittance-absorptivity). The required collector
area was determined by consideration of the optimized value of
variables. Maximum GOR of 1.6 was obtained at water heater en-
ergy input of 1.635 W. An AH-HDH setup using all-glass evacuated
tubes  collector  was  designed  and  modeled  by  Li  et  al.  [111] .  22
evacuated tubes (area of 14 m 2 ) were connected to a header. Air
stream entered the inner tube and exited from the outer in the
middle of the air heater, while, in the rest half, the air stream di-
rection was reversed. The thermal efficiency of air heater reached
33%  when  the  temperature  difference  between  the  inlet  air  and
ambient was in the range of 70 °C. Higher outlet air temperatures
could effectively improve the production rate at an optimum air-
flow rate. The energy efficiencies of 47% and 37% were obtained at
airflow rates of 140 m 3 /h and 33 m 3 /h, respectively. A WH-HDH
system  featuring  heat  pipe,  evacuated  tube  collector  and  bubble
column humidifier (as high-efficiency solar water heater and hu-
midifier)  was  investigated  by  Behnam  and  Shafii  [112] .  The  hu-
midifier was installed at the upper part of evacuated tubes, with
heat pipes extended into the humidifier. The advantage of the heat
pipe, as a heat transfer component, was its high heat transfer rate
at minor temperature differences [113] . Oil and water working flu-
ids were used in the space between the evacuated tube and heat
pipe. The results indicated that by using oil, system productivity of
6.275 L/d • m 2 and performance ratio of 0.65 were obtained, which
was  superior  to  the  results  of  water.  It  was  concluded  that  the
proper initial water depth in the humidifier was equal to the heat
pipe length within the humidifier. Transient performance of three
solar powered HDH systems (single, double and modified double
stages) in hot and humid climates was analyzed by Fouda et al.
[114] . Open/closed cycles of water and air were investigated. It was
found that using the solar air and water evacuated collectors (area
of 10 m 2 ) greatly enhanced the system performance. Moreover, the
modified double stage with open cycle had the best results (i.e. the
productivity of 350 L/d and GOR of 1.6). In the closed cycle, the
productivity was maximized at low ambient humidity, while the
same was achieved at high ambient humidity for the open cycle.
Therefore, it was recommended to switch between the open/closed
cycles  according  to  the  ambient  conditions  to  improve  the  sys-
tem performance. Optimization according to parametric study or
through design of experiments, increasing the humidifier and de-
humidifier efficiencies by selecting the highly efficient process and
components, and brine recirculation will improve the GOR of HDH
systems  integrated  with  evacuated  tube  collector.  The  evacuated
tube collector, which uses phase change material to transfer the
heat at high efficiency, is the most appropriate solar water heater
for HDH plants.

A WH-HDH system with a brine recirculation configuration in-
tegrated to a parabolic trough collector was proposed by Mohamed
and El-Minshawy [115] . It was concluded that the collector with an
outlet temperature of 100 °C was the perfect fit to run the HDH sys-
tem. The maximum freshwater amount was produced at maximum
temperatures, which were obtained in long summer days as well
as middays. The feed water flow rate was a challenging parame-
ter that should be reported. Brine recirculation can be an alterna-
tive for their proposed process. A humidification-dehumidification
system  coupled  to  solar  still  unit  (HDH-SS)  integrated  with  two
parabolic trough collectors (1.20 m length × 0.42 m width) was ex-
perimented by Abdullah et al. [116] during day and night. The pro-
ductivity was evaluated when the outlet brine from the packed bed
humidifier (height of 1.5m and cross-sectional area of 0.55 × 0.45
m 2 ) containing thorn trees and aspen pad was flowed to the SS

(0.5 m width × 1 m length). The results revealed that the aspen
pad had a greater production rate than the thorn trees. The GOR
values of 2.5 and 4.5 were reached at daytime and the whole day,
respectively. For the HDH-SS unit, the production rate was doubled
compared to the HDH unit. The maximum GOR of 5.7 proved the
superiority of the hybrid HDH-SS system along with using a highly
efficient  collector  (parabolic  trough  type).  As  the  collector  could
heat the feed seawater and brine, it seems feasible in MS-HDH and
VP-HDH processes due to its high thermal efficiency. Improving the
humidifier and dehumidifier performance by introducing a bubble
column type and a water storage tank can be investigated in future
studies on HDH systems integrated with parabolic trough collector.
An  MS-HDH  plant  was  investigated  when  being  heated  by  a
cylindrical Fresnel lens concentrator [100] . The receiver and evapo-
rator were filled with black fillers to absorb the concentrated solar
radiation, evaporating the seawater. The Fresnel lens works based
on the refraction law that a light ray travels in a straight path in
a transparent medium, but when it passes through the interface of
transparent media, it bends. The optical features of the proposed
lens  were  obtained  using  TracePro  software.  To  provide  a  more
realistic model during ray tracing, a solar half-angle of 0.27 ° was
considered. The focal line position of the Fresnel transmission con-
centrator was shortened when increasing the incidence light angle
and  axial  angle of  the  cylindrical surface.  It  means  the  light  fo-
cus slowly moved upward, widening the spot on the receiver. The
evaporation unit was installed at the focus line of the lens to ab-
sorb the sunlight. The hot saline water was sprayed on black ce-
ramic corrugated packings and was flowed into a pan under the
packing section. At the concentrator width of 1.5 m and bar fo-
cal spot width of 10 cm, the packing surface temperature raised to
80 °C. Heating in three stages improved the yield and led to GOR
and desalination rate of 2.1 and 3.4 L/h, respectively at the solar
intensity of about 870 W/m 2 . The next modification in this plant
can be heating the feed seawater by replacing the tube containing
seawater in the receiver focal line rather than using a water pan
humidifier. It could be mentioned that Fresnel lens coupled with
an HDH unit best performs in hotter climates.

In  this  section,  different  types  of  solar  air  and  water  heaters
for HDH systems were introduced. Overall, the system performance
is affected by the tilt angle, environmental conditions (e.g., solar
intensity,  air  temperature,  wind  velocity),  type  of  collector  (e.g.,
flat plate, evacuated tube, parabolic trough, double pass), collector
cover characteristics (transmittance-absorptivity), insolation mate-
rial and thickness, and air and water flow rates. A parametric study
on solar assisted HDH systems showed that the temperatures of
water and process air significantly influenced their productivities;
therefore, high energy efficiency heaters (e.g., parabolic trough and
evacuated  tube  collectors)  were  recommended.  In  solar  assisted
desalination systems, thermal energy storage with proper insula-
tion can be a useful component for conserving heat to meet the
energy demand of water evaporation. The solar driven HDH sys-
tems are sensitive to w/a ratio, due to the different energy efficien-
cies of the collectors during different hours a day. This necessitates
the optimization of w/a ratio for all HDH processes.

5.2.2. Geothermal heat source humidification-dehumidification
desalination system

Below  a  certain  depth,  the  ground  temperature  remains  con-
stant. By increasing the depth, temperature fluctuation is reduced
due  to  the  high  thermal  inertia  of  the  soil.  Using  this  energy
source enhances the thermal desalination technology, due to the
benefit  of  using  the  steady  temperature.  The  geothermal  energy
source denotes a viable, sustainable, rather stable, environmentally
friendly option [117] , which is abundant in many countries [118] .
The geothermal energy sources are generally classified as low (be-
low 100 °C), medium (between 100–150 °C), and high temperature

16

availability  of  this  energy  source.  Conducting  theoretical  studies
and combining the HDH systems with other desalination plants or
other renewable energy sources will lead to operate the desalina-
tion plant in decentralized area with freshwater shortage. Design-
ing a highly efficient heat exchanger to recover the geothermal en-
ergy should be considered in the future studies.

In summary, the geothermal energy source can provide the wa-
ter temperature range of 60 °C to 80 °C continuously that favors the
HDH process. Designing a highly efficient heat exchanger can be
a key factor in geothermal driven HDH processes, leading to the
production cost reduction in exchange for increasing productivity.
As the geothermal energy is extracted with a heat exchanger, op-
timization of w/a value should be considered. Planning the storage
tank for hot water saving contributes to operation during the day
and night.

5.2.3. Waste heat driven humidification-dehumidification desalination
system

The heat wasted from an industrial exhaust can be recovered
by a heat exchanger. A conventional waste heat source HDH sys-
tem is shown in Fig. 5 [125] . It exchanges heat with the outlet hu-
mid air from the humidifier or saline water from the dehumidifier,
heating the inlet air and water into the dehumidifier and humid-
ifier. A waste heat driven HDH that operates both during day and
night has more productivity compared to a solar driven HDH with-
out energy storage. Another advantage of this process is that when
HDH systems are installed in industrial zones, the continuous high
temperature waste can heat the process fluid within the humidi-
fier, consequently producing more desalinated water for drinking
and/or industrial uses [118] . As waste heat is mostly of low tem-
perature, the heat exchangers tend to be larger to recover signif-
icant quantities of energy, leading to an increase in capital cost.
Furthermore, the enhancement of the thermodynamic performance
through pinch technology increases the corresponding investment
cost of the waste heat driven HDH system [126] . The investment
cost of a waste heat recovery heat exchanger and heat recovery in-
vestment related to the fuel price evolution might outweigh the
profit gained by the recovered heat. Therefore, in addition to the
technical and economic risks related to designing a proper heat ex-
changer, a mismatch between demand and supply of the recovered
heat would deem this process impractical.

A waste heat powered HDH unit, incorporated with a plate type
heat exchanger as the dehumidifier was mathematically analyzed
by  He  et  al.  [126-127]  Air  heated  and  water  heated  waste  heat
driven HDH cycles were mostly theoretically studied. Chevron-type
plates were applied to heat the outlet saturated humid air from
the humidifier using the external waste heat source. Entropy gen-
erations of the humidifier and dehumidifier were determined, re-
vealing the energy loss. It was concluded that GOR values of 3.51
(at  top  water  temperature  of  75 °C)  and  3.04  could  be  obtained,
balancing the dehumidifier with its negative specific entropy gen-
eration and w/a of 1.28, respectively. Rising the inlet seawater tem-
perature from 15 °C to 35 °C achieved a superior unit performance
(in terms of productivity and GOR), while the heat recovery effect
contributed to a high outlet exhaust gas temperature, hence, less
heat  transfer  area  [128] .  Moreover,  the  high  inlet  seawater  tem-
perature decreased the involved air mass flow rate, reducing the
piping investment due to the low air density. The sub-atmospheric
pressure humidification improved the performance and decreased
the heat transfer area for the plate heat exchanger [129] .

The mathematical model of a waste heat driven WH-HDH sys-
tem was developed using the mass-energy conservation laws by He
et al. [125] . They also investigated the economic as well as ther-
modynamic performance of the system. The economic model was
also developed using the capital cost for the components, construc-
tion  materials  (carbon  steel),  pressure  factor  (atmospheric  pres-

dehumidification system [121]

(above 150 °C) [119] . A schematic diagram of a geothermal driven
HDH is illustrated in Fig. 4 . As shown in the figure, the geother-
mal energy is extracted with a heat exchanger [120] . Geothermal
energy can provide a stable energy compared with the intermit-
tent availability of solar energy. Solar driven systems require more
complex capturing devices and costly energy storage components
with limited sizes. These drawbacks are eliminated in the geother-
mal driven systems. The available geothermal sources freely oper-
ate the desalination units [2] . Few researchers used geothermal en-
ergy as the heat source. Geothermal driven HDH is a proper unit
at reasonable cost wherever an appropriate geothermal source is
available. It is due to the advantage of utilizing low temperature in
this technology. The geothermal driven HDH process is an imma-
ture technology, which can be improved to be widely used.

A geothermal driven WH-HDH system was simulated by Mo-
hamed and El-Minshawy [121] . A heat exchanger was used to ex-
change heat between the extracted underground water and saline
water. The effect of different geothermal source temperatures (in
the range of 60 °C to 90 °C) on the productivity was studied. The re-
sults illustrated that for w/a ratio within 1.5 to 2.5 and by increas-
ing the geothermal source inlet temperature the productivity in-
creased. A geothermal and fuel driven HDH plant with falling film
condenser and evaporator was designed and modeled by Bourouni
et  al.  [122] .  For  liquid  film  Reynolds  (Re)  numbers  in  the  range
of 400-630 good agreement between experimental and numerical
results was obtained. It was concluded that when geothermal re-
source is available [123] , geothermal driven HDH is promising due
to the low CPL. High water flow rate together with low inlet air
velocity into the humidifier led to an increase in system productiv-
ity. A hybrid solar/geothermal energy source combined with HDH
was theoretically and experimentally studied by Elminshawy et al.
[124] . Solar and geothermal energy sources were used for air and
water heating, respectively. Geothermal water in the temperature
range of 60 °C to 80 °C was used to heat the inlet water into the
humidification chamber. A solar air heater (area of 0.33 m 2 ) con-
taining staggered tubes had a better performance than a conven-
tional flat plate. At the optimum inlet water temperature into the
humidifier, the maximum productivity and GOR values of 104 L/m 2
and 1.58 were achieved, respectively. The CPL of $0.003 confirmed
the  excellence  of  the  proposed  hybrid  technology.  Fewer  studies
on geothermal driven HDH system are found due to the limited

sure), and overall factor for each component. The results showed
that maximum water production of about 100 kg/h and GOR of 1.5
(at top water temperature of 90 °C) could be obtained. Compared
with a solar driven energy source HDH plant, less production cost
of 37.7 $/m 3 for the waste heat source was achieved by the HDH
unit, indicating the superiority of the proposed system. It was con-
cluded that reducing the seawater temperature and increasing the
humidification  effectiveness  were  beneficial  to  improve  the  eco-
nomic performance of the desalination system. Moreover, chang-
ing the dehumidification effectiveness from 0.8 to 0.9 increased the
GOR by 44%.

Four  configurations  of  WH-HDH  coupled  to  an  organic  Rank-
ine cycle were investigated thermodynamically as well as economi-
cally [130] . In Configuration 1, the organic Rankine cycle condenser
water  was  directly  fed  to  the  HDH.  In  Configuration  2,  the  or-
ganic Rankine cycle condenser water was passed through a heat
exchanger  to  raise  its  temperature  by  absorbing  heat  from  the
organic Rankine cycle evaporator prior to flowing into the HDH.
In Configuration 3, the outlet stream from organic Rankine cycle
evaporator heat source flowed into a heat exchanger to increase
the HDH feed water temperature. The high and low temperatures
of the organic Rankine cycle were in the range of 135 °C to 35 °C
and the pinch temperature of condenser and evaporator were both
5 °C. Packed bed humidifier containing polypropylene meshed retic-
ulum  structure  was  selected  reaching  TBT  of  about  52 °C  at  the
feed water temperature of 74 °C. Configuration 4 was the combi-
nation  of  Configurations  1  and  3.  In  all  of  the  proposed  config-
urations, the heat wasted from the organic Rankine cycle evapo-
rator or condenser was utilized. The results showed that the or-
ganic Rankine cycle with toluene yielded more power due to the
high energy/exergy efficiencies. Configurations 4 and 2 produced
freshwater in comparison with other configurations. Configurations
1  and  2  had  the  least  freshwater  and  cost,  respectively.  Among
seven working fluids (i.e, R600, R245fa, n -heptane, isopentane, n -
pentane, and cyclohexane toluene), n -heptane achieved the highest
freshwater production rate.

A WH-HDH system to recover waste heat by two types of plate
heat exchanger (heat transfer area of 3.9 m 2 ) was modeled by He
et al. [131] . Heat/mass transfer areas of the plate heat exchanger
were calculated by the concept of low-grade heat collector (LGHC)
and hot water recuperator (HWR). They were used to recover en-
ergy from the hot desalinated water and the waste heat from the
exhaust gas, respectively. The fluid was the exhaust gas in LGHC,
while for the HWR it was the outlet-desalinated water from dehu-

midifier. The results showed that the modified heat capacity ratio
(M-HCR) of the humidifier was beyond one, whereas that of the
dehumidifier was about one, which is significant for the HDH sys-
tem. At minimum irreversibility of the components, a maximum
GOR of 2.0 was attained. The proposed system outperformed (in
terms of cost) the conventional HDH having heat transfer only with
an exchanger. Using the direct contact dehumidifier improved the
CPL by 1.5 times compared with the conventional one.

Waste heat driven HDH systems are used to heat the seawater
as well as process air with capability of operation during the day
and night. Installing an HDH plant in the fields of the power plants,
refinery  and  petrochemical  centers  could  provide  the  drinkable
water  and  using  the  waste  heat.  An  organic  Rankine  cycle  with
proper working fluid can be coupled to a waste heat driven HDH
to enhance their system performance. The availability of a waste
energy source and designing a high efficiency heat exchanger for
the HDH system is one of the main challenges. Chevron-type plate
heat exchangers were reported as one of the best heat exchanger
configurations  for  exchanging  heat  between  the  industrial  waste
and  process  fluids.  Moreover,  a  hot  water  recuperator  can  be  a
good candidate where waste heat energy source is available. Us-
ing an efficient heat exchanger provides a high water temperature
of 75-90 °C, consequently reducing the airflow, heat transfer area
and piping investment. The GOR values variation from 1.5 to 3.5
shows that further improvement is required in this area.

5.2.4. Biomass driven humidification-dehumidification desalination
system

Utilization  of  biomass  energy  for  HDH  units  provides  contin-
uous operation with higher productivity compared to solar HDH
units [30] . As the electricity production costs from biomass source
driven power plants are comparable with wind, geothermal or hy-
droelectric power plants, water production using biomass sources
could be economical [132] . Despite abundant biomass availability,
biomass driven HDH systems are rarely investigated. A schematic
diagram of an AH-HDH driven by biomass is shown in Fig. 6 .

A  biomass  (sawdust  briquettes)  driven  HDH  system  consisted
of bubble column humidifier/dehumidifier was investigated by Ra-
jaseenivasan and Srithar [133] . A perforated screen was mounted
at  the  height  of  0.03  m  from  the  basin  plate  of  the  humidifier.
Water  depth  in  the  humidifier  was  kept  constant  at  0.8  m.  The
biomass fuel produced a calorific value of 3475 kJ/kg, producing
a top water temperature of 60 °C. Two test series were conducted
with and without preheating of the inlet air into the humidifier.

troduced by Sahoo et al. [135] . A maximum saline water temper-
ature of 88.1 °C was obtained in the proposed poly-generation sys-
tem. The condenser heat of the absorption refrigeration cycle was
used in the ME-HDH system for production of potable water. The
proposed process with high-energy efficiency of about 49% used
the  waste  heat  taken  from  the  turbine.  Thermodynamic  analysis
and optimization of the solar-biomass in the poly-generation pro-
cess led to exergy efficiency of about 21%. The poly-generation pro-
cess in the solar-biomass system enhanced the energy output by
about 78% in comparison with a simple power plant with primary
energy savings of about 50%.

A  poly-generation  system  driven  by  biogas-geothermal  heat
sources  was  thermodynamically  investigated  by  Rostamzadeh  et
al.  [136]  and  then  optimized  through  energy,  exergy,  exergoeco-
nomic and environmental analyses [137] . The poly-generation sys-
tem  comprised  of  a  biogas  steam  reforming  system,  two  Kalina
cycles, an absorption-compression heat pump cycle, an absorption
refrigeration cycle, a liquefied natural gas system, an HDH desali-
nation  system  and  a  water  heater.  The  system  produced  overall
cooling and heating capacities of 1799 kW and 538.1 kW, respec-
tively, output power of 443.4 kW, desalination rate of 367.92 L/h
and hydrogen production rate of 0.2583 kg/s. This led to the ther-
mal  efficiency  of  about  62%  and  exergy  efficiency  of  about  75%.
Using genetic algorithm optimization, the thermal and exergy ef-
ficiencies were improved by 12.07% and 5.16%, respectively.

In summary, biomass fuels can be used for preheating the pro-
cess air and water of HDH systems. Poly-generation systems and
optimization of their processes improve the energy and exergy ef-
ficiencies. The water temperature acts as the main controlling fac-
tor compared to other variables. The biomass driven HDH systems
and poly-generation systems using the biomass can provide the ac-
ceptable temperature range of 60-80 °C. Due to more energy loss
by  biomass  stove  (hence,  its  low  thermal  energy  efficiency),  us-
ing biomass along with solar or geothermal sources and applying
multi-generation systems are recommended. The future step in us-
ing biomass in HDH systems can be performed by developing a
highly efficient energy exchange device or using the industrial fur-
nace technology. In such furnaces, the fluid tubes can be installed
in the furnace perimeter for heating the air or water. Proper in-
sulation of the stove could save the energy released from biomass
and significantly increase the process fluid temperature.

5.2.5. Photovoltaic source humidification-dehumidification
desalination system

Photovoltaic (PV) panels can be used to generate electricity to
run the electrical components of HDH systems. It should be noted
that  during  electricity  generation,  due  to  the  resistance  against
heat transfer, the panel temperature increases and causes heat dis-
sipation, reducing the PV efficiency [138] . Therefore, the PV mod-
ules are characterized by converting solar energy into thermal and
electric energies. The heat from the PV panel can be recovered by
exchanging heat with the process water or air, improving the PV
efficiency [139] . In other words, the main challenge facing electric-
ity generation using PV can be eliminated by its integration with
HDH systems especially in off-grid locations. Optimizing the feed
air and seawater flow rate would lead to higher efficiency of PV
driven HDH systems [140] .

A PV driven AH-HDH system was modeled considering PV ther-
mal energy recovery by Giwa et al. [141] . Air was flowed to a gap
behind  the  PV  to  cool  down  its  back  surface.  Life  cycle  analysis
method based on ISO14040 was used to assess the environmental
effects accom panied by the stages of the PV-HDH lifespan. Despite
reporting  the  PV-RO  unit  to  have  the  least  environmental  effect
among  all  desalination  technologies,  it  was  proved  that  the  PV-
HDH  outperformed  PV-RO.  The  proposed  system  had  about  84%
decrease in environmental effects in comparison with the PV-RO

Fig. 6.  Schematic diagram of an AH-HDH driven by biomass [133]

The air preheating was carried out in an air heat exchanger located
between the humidifier and the combustion chamber. The analysis
showed that the water temperature was the main controlling fac-
tor of humidifier operation compared to other variables. The units
with and without air preheating achieved desalination rates of 6.1
and 3.5 L/h, respectively. Waste heat recovery using the heat ex-
changer reduced the fuel consumption by 45% for producing 1 L
of desalinated water. Comparison of the solar and biomass driven
HDH systems in terms of GOR revealed the superior performance
of the solar driven system due to the higher energy loss through
the biomass stove. However, the desalination rate and CPL of the
biomass HDH was better than the solar assisted HDH. The maxi-
mum GOR of about 3.3 was attained whenever the water and air
were heated before flowing in the humidifier.

4 + 0.4CO

An  AH-HDH  desalination  system  using  waste  heat  recov-
ered  from  the  flue  gases  that  fueled  a  biogas  (0.6CH
2 )
driven turbine cycle was investigated by Jabari et al. [134] . High-
temperature  flue  gases  of  the  turbine  were  used  to  preheat  the
process air of the HDH system. Through the mixed integer non-
linear programming problem using the BONMIN tool in GAMS op-
timization software, the total capital, daily electricity procurement,
as well as maintenance and operation costs of the combined cool-
ing,  power  and  desalinated  water  production  facility  over  a  24-
hour time interval were minimized. An increase in the ambient air
temperature increased the absolute air humidity leaving the hu-
midifier due to the improvement in surface evaporation rate, en-
hancing the desalination rate.

A  poly-generation  process  of  power  production,  cooling  and
ME-HDH desalination system using a solar-biomass system was in-

system. The PV produced freshwater of 2.28 L/d per unit area of
the PV as well as 1.93 kW of electricity (200% more than the re-
quired electrical energy to operate the proposed HDH system). An
HDH-PV was optimized based on the maximum-efficiency ratio by
considering operational conditions (i.e. number of PV modules, wa-
ter flow rate and height of humidifier) at a wide range of ambi-
ent conditions [142] . The production cost of 5.5 €/m 3  confirmed
the benefit of the proposed system. As the mass transfer coeffi-
cient is more affected by the humidifier diameter rather than its
height [69] , investigation of the humidifier diameter is proposed
for future studies. Recovering the heat liberated from the PV panel
for brine heating would be helpful in HDH processes rather than
heating the feed air or water with a lower temperature than brine.

5.3. Multi-effect and multi-stage humidification-dehumidification
desalination systems

Multi-effect  and  multi-stage  humidification-dehumidification
(ME-HDH [143] and MS-HDH [144] ) systems utilize the technol-
ogy of several humidification/dehumidification effects and stages
to improve components efficiency due to the condensation latent
heat recovery and several humidification processes. Because of the
small temperature difference between the outlet saturated air from
the  humidifier  and  the  inlet  saline  water  in  conventional  HDH
units, the energy recovery rate is low; hence, this difference should
be extended by the MS or ME technologies. Schematic diagrams of
ME-HDH and MS-HDH systems are presented in Fig. 7 . It should
be noted that the brine can be reused in the conventional HDH
process, due to TBT upper than 45 °C. In sub-atmospheric pressure
humidification with TBT of lower than 40 °C, using an intermediate
heating process is highly recommended.

The  low  energy  efficiency  makes  the  conventional  HDH  sys-
tems less competitive. ME-HDH and MS-HDH technologies that ef-
fectively improve the energy efficiency are recommended. In ME-
HDH systems, heat is recovered by air circulation between the hu-
midifier  and  dehumidifier  using  forced  or  natural  draft  circula-
tion  [146] .  The  energy  and  exergy  recovery  rates  increase  when
the  pinch  point  temperature  (i.e.  the  temperature  difference  be-
tween exiting air and brine from the humidifier and leaving air and
water  from  the  dehumidifier)  decreases  [147] .  The  temperature-
enthalpy diagrams of the one-stage and two-stage ME-HDH sys-
tems  and  two-stage  MS-HDH  are  shown  in  Fig.  8 ,  confirming
the  heat  recovery  of  these  technologies  [148] .  It  can  be  found
that  the  energy  recovery  rate  (energy  recovered  over  the  sum-
mation  of  recovered  and  added  energies)  in  a  two-effect  HDH
was about 1.25 times higher than that in a one-effect HDH pro-
cess (energy recovery rates of 0.836 and 0.67 for two-stage and
one-stage  HDH,  respectively).  Moreover,  the  energy  recovery  ra-
tio in a two-stage HDH was about 1.35 times higher than a one-
stage HDH process (energy recovery rates of 0.7 and 0.52 for two-
stage  and  one-stage  HDH,  respectively).  By  minimizing  the  tem-
perature difference between the air temperature at the injection
and  extraction  points  in  MS-HDH  systems  the  energy  efficiency
improves.

Hou  posed  the  concept  of  a  solar-assisted  ME-HDH  process
[148] .  The  air  with  different  mass  flow  rates  entered  the  two-
stage  units,  where  two  stages  of  humidification  and  dehumidifi-
cation were conducted at high (60-80 °C) and low temperatures
(30-60 °C), respectively. The energy efficiency of the two-stage cy-
cle within the proposed temperature range was higher than that
of the one-stage process. The minimum temperature difference at
pinches was 1 °C, leading to the energy recovery rate of 0.836. The
multi-stage humidification could enhance the energy recovery rate,
reaching higher GOR values. Finding the best value of airflow rate
at each effect contributing to process optimization should be paid
attention. A design algorithm was proposed to determine the flux

diagram of a solar ME-HDH unit in a CAOW cycle. The productiv-
ity was found more sensitive to the solar collector selection rather
than other components. Hence, the recommendations specifically
emphasized on selecting the best solar collector [149] . The min-
imum cooling and heating demands (recovered and rejected en-
ergies)  in  the  ME-HDH  system  were  determined  through  simu-
lation, leading to the production of a commercial size solar ME-
HDH desalination plant. A solar-assisted ME-HDH desalination sys-
tem  using  an  FPC  was  designed  by  Lovelyn  [150] .  The  required
collector area for producing 1 m 3 /d of potable water was 48 m 2 ,
using a collector efficiency of 70% and the maximum solar inso-
lation of 800 W/m 2 . The high productivity of ME-HDH and MS-
HDH  plants  necessitates  using  an  economic  but  highly  efficient
heater.

A two-stage ME-HDH process was modeled using mass and en-
ergy balances by Kang et al. [151] . The model was validated by ex-
perimental  data,  proving  its  accuracy  due  to  well  predicting  the
ME-HDH behavior. The recycled residual heat in the brine and the
latent heat of condensation led to the higher efficiency of the ME-
HDH  system.  The  results  indicated  the  desalination  rate  of  72.6

kg/h and GOR of 2.4, respectively. The performances of regenera-
tive and air-extraction MS-HDH processes were compared by Kang
et al. [144] through pinch technology. In the regenerative type, the
n th stage was heated by the solar energy to heat the feed seawa-
ter, while the latent heat of condensation heated the other stages.
The inlet saline water into the first dehumidifier was divided to be
sprayed in all humidifiers and the thermal energy was utilized in
a cascade manner. In air-extraction HDH system, the feed saline
water  was  preheated  in  the  first  dehumidifier,  entered  into  the
second dehumidifier and this process continued. The leaving hot
water from the n th  dehumidifier flowed into a water heater. The
hot water was sprayed to the n th  stage; the brine of the n th  hu-
midifier flowed into the lower stages and flowed out from the 1 st
stage. It was revealed that the pinch point temperature difference
and the number of stages affect the system performance. The GORs
of  the  regenerative  four-stage  HDH  and  the  air-extraction  four-
stage HDH were about 4.5 and 5. It was due to the higher input
heat of the regenerative MS-HDH than that of the air-extraction
MS-HDH. A maximum was determined for the number of stages
due to the gradual weakness of the performance by adding more
stages. The air-extraction MS-HDH and regenerative MS-HDH de-
salination processes are recommended when the main design goals
are  the  GOR  and  recovery  ratio,  respectively.  An  experimental
study on the two proposed designs can be a progressive step to-
wards  the  industrialization  of  the  HDH  process  in  decentralized
regions.

Improvements in  terms  of  the  flow  of  the  ME-HDH  and  MS-
HDH, brine reusing, multi-extraction and variable pressure cycles
led to gain high energy recovery rate and GOR. These processes
can be improved by water heating in each effect rather than air
heating in each stage or effect. It is due to the high thermal capac-
ity of water compared to air. Optimization of flow rates leads to
heat recovery enhancement. Energy and exergy analyses are rec-
ommended for optimization of these processes. It should be noted
that the GOR and recovery ratio of regenerative MS-HDH is less
than that of air-extraction MS-HDH due to the higher input heat of
the regenerative system. The increase of GOR with the increment
of the stage number becomes smaller or even negligible, leading
to stage number optimization. The pinch technology could bring
a  high  energy-saving  effect.  Despite  higher  productivity  of  ME-
HDH and MS-HDH systems, lack of experimental results is motiva-
tional for conducting further research. The heat recovery of brine
in  multi-effect  or  multi-stage  systems  which  operate  in  atmo-
spheric pressure should be considered for GOR and recovery ratio
enhancement.

5.4. Hybrid humidification-dehumidification desalination system

HDH systems can be coupled with different desalination meth-
ods  to  enhance  the  system  performance  parameters.  Coupling
the HDH to solar stills (HDH-SS) [152] , RO unit (HDH-RO) [153] ,
humidification-dehumidification-adsorption  (HDHA)  [154] ,  desic-
cant wheel [155] , and water flashing evaporation [156] have been
experimented. In this section, a complete review of the challenges
and applications of hybrid HDH units is presented.

A cascade SS was coupled with HDH to simultaneously produce
desalinated as well as hot water [157] . In this process, the SS acted
as a solar water heater. Parametric study of this system led to per-
formance improvement at high temperature and optimum values
of  air  (0.199  m 3 /min)  and  water  (40  mL/min)  flow  rates.  In  the
case of coupling cascade SS to an HDH system that produced WH-
HDH, the superiority of the hybrid system was concluded. It was
shown that productivity and system efficiency improved by 400%
and 122%, respectively.

A hybrid HDH-SS unit that reused the outlet brine from humid-
ifier (TBT of 75 °C) was developed by Sharshir et al. [158] . Reusing
the brine increased the GOR by 50% in comparison with a conven-
tional HDH system. The productivity was found to improve from
90% to 20% when changing from HDH with a single SS to that with
five SSs. The GOR was changed from 2.14 in HDH system to 3.1 in
HDH-SS. Considerable improvement in productivity and GOR con-
firms the promising advantage of the hybrid system performance.
This change in the configuration of conventional HDH decreased
the CPL by 70% and endorsed the superiority of the hybrid HDH-
SS system. An evacuated solar water heater assisted HDH-SS sys-
tem was modeled by Sharshir et al. [159] . The maximum seawater
temperature of 85 °C and TBT of 75 °C were obtainable in the pro-
posed system. The productivity and GOR of the SS feed with outlet
warm water from the humidifier was more than that of the con-
ventional SS by 242 % and 39 %, respectively.

Schematic diagrams of the coupled SS-HDH and HDH-cascade
solar stills are shown in Fig. 9 . The outlet water from the solar stills
can be flown into the humidifier (see Fig. 9 a) or the brine can be
fed to the solar stills (see Fig 9 b). In Fig. 9 a, the inlet humidifier
water is heated via the SS negating the requirement of a solar wa-
ter heater, while in Fig. 9 b the brine is heated in the HU, increasing
the SS productivity. These hybrid systems can omit the disadvan-
tage of using an SS for the desalination process that is run during
the daytime. These hybrid systems can be a good candidate in con-
ventional HDH-SS design due to the high brine rejection temper-
ature from the humidifier. Due to the low brine temperature in a

VP-HDH system, coupling an SS to this type of HDH process cannot
achieve higher SS productivity compared to a conventional HDH or
HC system. In this case, developing a solar still-varied pressure hu-
midification dehumidification (SS-VP-HDH) unit is recommended.
It should be noted that in addition to optimizing the parameters
of the HDH process, a reasonable tilt angle of the absorber plate
inside the still, water depth in the basin, glass cover thickness, in-
sulation thickness, condensing cover material, solar collector type,
and water mass flow rate should be selected to improve the sys-
tem performance. The water level in the basin should be consid-
ered during designing an SS. By increasing the water level up to a
certain value, depending on the tilt angle and solar intensity, the
nocturnal desalination rate can be increased. Beyond this certain

value, the heat and mass transfer coefficients are decreased, reduc-
ing productivity [160] .

The HDH-wick still system (TBT of 70 °C) performance with and
without cooling film (denoted herein by Configurations 1 and 2,
respectively) was theoretically investigated by Sharshir et al. [161] .
In the Configuration 2, a cooling film of water flowed downward
the still glass covers. It was observed that increasing the feed wa-
ter  mass  flow  rate  reduced  the  still  desalination  rate  when  not
using the cooling film. However, an increase was observed when
using the cooling film during the daytime. High productivity was
due to the glass cover temperature reduction (i.e., low tempera-
ture difference between water and glass) when using the cooling
film. The test during the nighttime increased the desalination rate

22

for both configurations. Through using the cooling film, the tem-
perature difference between water and glass increased, achieving a
high heat transfer rate and efficient performance. Using the cool-
ing film, the productivity improved in comparison with the config-
uration without cooling film by 5.3% and 30% during the day and
night, respectively; and by about 280% in comparison with a con-
ventional still. Again, higher productivity during nighttime was due
to the less glass temperature in the case of cooling film application.
The advantage of parallel feeding from HDH to SS units is the
utilization of heat of brine in SS plants. Using cascade SS leads to a
continuous reduction in water temperature, decreasing productiv-
ity.

A progressive step in improving SS-HDH systems can be using
a solar concentrator or highly efficient solar water heater for heat-
ing the water in basin, driving the system by geothermal or waste
heat energies as well as applying PV cells for heating the process
fluids and running the electrical devices. Using phase change ma-
terial on the back of SS, using different nanoparticles [162] in basin
of SS multi-stage and multi-effect humidifiers as well as using di-
rect contact dehumidifiers can change the process into a highly ef-
ficient one.

A schematic diagram of an HDH-RO unit is illustrated in Fig. 10 .
In this scheme, the brine exiting the humidifier flows into the RO
unit. However, due to the insensitivity of the HDH system to the
salinity, it seems that the RO-HDH unit has a better performance
than HDH-RO.

Exergoeconomic  study  of  an  HDH-RO  unit  operating  under
OAOW  and  two  modified  OACW  configurations  was  studied  by
Jamil et al. [9] . The HDH-RO unit was analyzed under three dif-
ferent retrofits including HDH-RO, HDH-RO equipped with a Pel-
ton turbine and HDH-RO with a pressure heat exchanger. The two
modified HDH-RO units were proposed to recover the pressure en-
ergy of the exiting brine from the RO to run the pump or exchange
energy between the rejected brine from the RO and the humidi-
fier before entering the high-pressure pump. The analysis revealed
that the HDH-RO equipped with a pressure heat exchanger had the
highest GOR (about 16) and exergy efficiency (about 3%) followed
by the HDH-RO with a Pelton turbine and the ordinary HDH-RO.
Upgrading the HDH-RO system with Pelton turbine and pressure

exchanger  could  significantly  decrease  the  cost.  Exergy  analysis
of an RO-HDH system using a solar air heater was conducted by
Ameri and Eshaghi [153] . The RO unit with an active area of 37.2
m 2 , water permeability coefficient of 3.5 × 10 −9  kg/m 2 .s.Pa, and
salt  permeability  coefficient  of  3.2  × 10 −5  kg/m 2 s  was  modeled
through the solution–diffusion scheme with respect to salt diffu-
sivity and concentration variation over the membrane length. By
feeding  the  brine  of  RO  to  the  HDH  unit  (TBT  of  26.78 °C),  the
pumping and pre-treatment requirements of the HDH system were
eliminated. It was concluded that the exergy efficiency of the HDH
system depended on the FPC performance. The exergy efficiencies
of RO, HDH and RO-HDH systems at feed water salinity of 350 0 0
ppm were about 0.7%, 12.7% and 20%, respectively. Eliminating the
energy consuming devices, coupling the RO to a stand-alone HDH,
and  recovering  energy  from  the  RO  brine  improved  the  systems
performance.

A multi-extraction HDH unit with vapor desorption/adsorption
towers  and  brine  recirculation  was  proposed  by  Capocelli  et  al.
[154] . Process simulation presented how the GOR reached values
above 10 via multiple extractions. Humid air extraction from the
humidifier  and  its  injection  into  the  dehumidifier  improved  the
process thermodynamic efficiency. Multi-extraction method dimin-
ished the temperature difference between streams, minimizing the
distribution of driving forces and exergy destruction. To recover the
heat, the brine reuse could be an efficient option. Low brine tem-
perature of the HDH process (about 15 °C) allowed the brine re-
circulation in the CACW cycle. The outlet saturated air from the
dehumidifier flowed to an adsorption tower to adsorb air humidity
with a hydrophilic porous material. In other words, coupling an ad-
sorption tower to the HDH system improved the dehumidification
process and GOR.

An HDH system coupled with an adsorption desalination (HDH-
AD) system was designed to produce desalinated water and obtain
chilled water for air-conditioning [163] . The condenser of the AD
was  used  as  the  heating  source  for  the  HDH  in  two  layouts.  In
Layout 1, the HDH inlet seawater was precooled in the AD evap-
orator before being fed to the HU, while in Layout 2 the seawater
was used to cool the adsorption process. Silica gel and water were
used as the adsorber pair. The overall heat transfer coefficients of

23

bed,  evaporator  and  condenser  of  the  AD  components  were  0.6,
0.35, and 0.5, respectively. It was reported that the GOR values of
8 and 7.6 were obtained for Layouts 1 and 2, respectively. The GOR
of the conventional AH-HDH and WH-HDH layouts without cou-
pling to AD cycle was about 2, confirming the superiority of the
hybrid HDH-AD system. The main advantage of the hybrid plants
is the elimination of using heater due to their significant heat re-
covery. Conducting an experimental study on the HDH-AD process
is recommended.

A two-stage HDH system using a desiccant wheel was proposed
by Agouz et al. [155] to increase the system performance. The dif-
ference between the first and second stage HDH was in their heat-
ing source. The first stage HDH heating source consisted of solar
air  and  water  heaters,  while  the  second  one  used  the  desiccant
wheel to increase the inlet air temperature following the reduc-
tion on the relative humidity value. The relative humidity reduc-
tion caused more vapor to be carried with the air and increased
the humidifier efficiency. The desiccant wheel could be replaced
with a heat exchanger to increase the process air temperature by
sensible heat exchange. However, the HDH system containing the
desiccant wheel outperformed the heat exchanger. It was due to
the fact that the desiccant wheel dehumidification was based on
both sensible and latent heats, while the heat exchanger was only
based on sensible heat. Maximum GOR of 4.5 and minimum spe-
cific thermal energy of 0.15 kWh/kg were obtained through two-
stage HDH coupled to the desiccant wheel. The one and two stages
HDH-desiccant wheel units were more efficient than the conven-
tional HDH by 280% and 385% in terms of GOR values, respectively.
HDH hybridization with SS, RO, AD and desiccant wheel units
are the options that could improve the system performance based
on GOR or exergy efficiency. These units can be the heating source
of air or water, or recover the brine heat. Design improvement of
SS using cooling film in the HDH-SS, negated the requirement for
pumping and pretreatment process in the HDH-RO, leading to per-
formance enhancement. Compared with a conventional HDH, 50%
improvement in GOR of the HDH-SS, 400% increase in productivity
of the SS-HDH, achieving GOR values above 8 for the HDH-AD sys-
tem, 280% improvement in GOR of the HDH system using a desic-
cant wheel were achieved pointing at the potential for hybrid sys-
tems. Improving the SS performance by using a hot water storage
2 ) and phase change
tank, nanoparticles (e.g., Al
materials (e.g., paraffin wax) is recommended for all types of hy-
brid SS and HDH processes. Volume fraction of nanoparticles is the
challenging factor that requires attention. Integrating the SS by se-
ries module could offer higher productivity than the parallel mod-
ule in SS-HDH due to increasing the feed water temperature flow-
ing into the humidifier [164] . GOR upper than 10 in an HDH-AD
system or GOR of 16 for an HDH-RO unit, exergy efficiency of 20%
for an RO-HDH can be a motivation for industrialization of afore-
mentioned hybrid systems.

5.5. Variable pressure humidification-dehumidification desalination
system

The  variable  pressure  humidification-dehumidification  (VP-
HDH) process can overcome the disadvantage of the conventional
HDH desalination systems that operate at atmospheric pressure. In
the VP-HDH process, the humidifier and dehumidifier operate at
different pressures. A schematic diagram of the VP-HDH system is
shown in Fig. 11 . The evaporation and condensation processes un-
der reduced and elevated pressures are one of the solutions to en-
hance the HDH system performance. The extra thermal resistance
against heat transfer is reduced at high pressure of the dehumid-
ifier,  improving  the  energy  recovery.  However,  variable  pressure
operations can be a serious concern due to the high energy con-
sumption of devices. A mechanical/thermo-mechanical compressor

process [167]

[165] , vacuum pump [166] , expander or throttle valve [167] is used
to provide different pressures at the humidifier and dehumidifier.
The sub-atmospheric humidifier pressure can be produced (with-
out any mechanical energy input) by a barometric head that ben-
efits from the temperature phase-change desalination [168] . Evap-
oration occurs at low temperature, with minimum thermal energy
input for phase change, enabling the process to be driven by solar
energy or waste heat [169] .

In  this  section,  VP-HDH  [170] ,  vacuum  humidification-
dehumidification  (VHDH)  [171]  and  humidification-compression
(HC) [172] processes are described.

A VP-HDH system was investigated by Narayan et al. [170] to
evaluate the possibility of using a throttle valve instead of a me-
chanical expander. This replacement led to less energy consump-
tion due to the lower energy requirement and irreversibility of the
expander in comparison with the throttle valve. They also coupled
an RO to the VP-HDH system to examine the GOR of the hybrid
system. It was found that the optimized VP-HDH-RO unit having
a GOR of about 6 could compete with MED and MSF in terms of
GOR. They recommended using thermo-compressors having better
performance (GOR of about 20) than mechanical compressors. The
best performance of the VP-HDH with a thermo-compressor was
obtained at maximum ejector efficiency. A VP-HDH-RO cycle which
used 120 °C steam was investigated by Narayan et al. [173] . Scale
formation within the RO module was prevented by maintaining the
brine temperature below 60 °C. A TVC and an expander were used
in this varied pressure operation. The entropy rate was decreased
using high pressure, saturated steam at a low specific entropy and
high specific enthalpy. The system performance in terms of exergy
efficiency was compared with MVC, MSF, MED, MVC and RO. The
performance of their proposed system was found comparable with
their counterparts. It was concluded that the TVC by 50% exergy
destruction was the component with the highest irreversibility. In
VP-HDH process with throttle valve, it is predicted that by reduc-
ing the humidifier pressure the airflow rate decreases, resulting in
reduction in water flow rate and correspondingly productivity.

The  performance  of  a  VP-HDH  system  including  bubble  col-
umn type humidifier and dehumidifier was investigated by Liu and

mm was found as optimum according to the pressure drop. Copper
coils were installed inside the humidifier and dehumidifier to pro-
vide the heating and cooling loads. The humidifier and dehumidi-
fier pressures varied in ranges of 0.48-1.03 bar, and 1.03-2.07 bar,
respectively. The pressure reduction along humidifier enhanced the
humidification due to transferring more water vapor molecules to
the  process  air  and  the  increase  in  humidifier  effectiveness  was
due to the mass transfer coefficient improvement. An increase in
dehumidifier  pressure  had  the  same  trend  as  humidifier  at  vac-
uum. It was due to the bubbles size reduction and the increase
in the gas holdup that increased the specific area. Based on the
modified effectiveness-number of transfer units ( ε-NTU) model the
pressure raise increased the air density at a constant superficial ve-
locity that raised the air mass flow rate, decreasing the NTU. This
in turn decreased the effectiveness. The results showed that oper-
ating the humidifier and dehumidifier at sub-atmospheric and el-
evated pressures improved the total heat transfer by 35% and 27%,
respectively.

The energy balance on air and water streams for a control vol-

ume of humidifier or dehumidifier is:
d  ̇ q air = d  ̇ q w

d  ̇ q air =   ̇ m air d h air

d  ̇ q w =   ̇ m w d h w

In addition, the humidifier efficiency is defined as [175] :

ηHU =

(43)

(44)

Therefore,  reducing  humidifier  pressure,  the  humidifier  effi-

ciency improves [176] due to an increase in absolute humidity.

A liquid ring vacuum pump can accelerate high-pressure water
to higher velocity and lower pressure. This low pressure provides a
suction force that draws in the air stream from the humidifier. Af-
ter mixing, the humid air and water are decelerated in a separator,
reaching the discharge pressure (101.3 kPa) [176] . Using this type
of vacuum pump improves performance at the expense of reducing
heat exchanger size.

A VHDH process was optimized by Rahimi-Ahar et al. [171] us-
ing the response surface methodology (RSM). Evacuated tube solar

water heater produced top feed temperature of 90 °C for process in
all humidifier pressures. The TBT of 38 °C and 57 °C were obtained
at humidifier pressures of 50 kPa and 90 kPa, respectively. A liquid
ring vacuum pump created the vacuum in the packed bed type hu-
midifier. The air and water were heated by solar energy while the
vacuum pump was operated by electrical energy. The GOR value
of about 3.4 and cost of $0.0041 /m 3  confirmed the process per-
formance enhancement in comparison with other systems. Para-
metric study of the system indicated that reducing the humidifier
pressure was beneficial as it intensified the effects of this variable
over other variables against the desalination rate.

The driving force in this system is calculated by [66] :

Fig. 12 shows the humid air enthalpy versus liquid temperature
at the inlet and outlet streams of the humidifier. Calculating the
driving force in the humidifier proved the experimental results. It
can be concluded that reducing the humidifier pressure from 90
kPa to 50 kPa the driving force improves by about 30% at w/a ratio
of 2.

The water circulation of the liquid ring vacuum pump caused
condensation  of  moisture  content  of  the  outlet  humid  air  from
the humidifier. It was concluded that the process could run with
no dehumidifier; therefore, desalinated water production cost was
decreased due to the fixed capital cost reduction. It was recom-
mended to couple the liquid ring vacuum pump with HDH (due
to the lower energy consumption of the liquid ring vacuum pump
than the compressor) and not to use dehumidifier. The circulated
water in the vacuum pump condensed the whole moisture of hu-
mid  air;  hence,  adding  a  compressor  was  not  required  for  the
VHDH system [3] . Coupling a compressor to the HDH unit rein-
forced the dehumidification process while diminishing the system
performance due to its high electrical energy consumption com-
pared with the liquid ring vacuum pump.

A solar-assisted HC process using humidifier, dehumidifier, so-
lar air heater and MVC was simulated by Ghalavand et al. [165] .
The released thermal energy of MVC was used for heating the feed
saline water (top feed temperature of 85 °C and TBT of 54 °C). Con-
sidering equal energy input, the GOR of HC was found to be higher
(i.e. 2.07) than WH-HDH and AH-HDH systems (i.e. 0.4 and 0.33,
respectively). This was due to the high desalination rate of HC. Ex-
perimental  [172]  and  theoretical  [177]  studies  on  an  HC  system
revealed that the maximum productivity could be obtained at an
optimum value of 2 for the w/a ratio, dehumidifier to humidifier
pressure ratio ( P DH / P HU ) of 3 and maximum inlet air temperature
of 77 °C. The model well predicted the system performance by con-
sideration of insulation effect [78] . The drained brine temperature
of 54 °C can be a heat recovery source in the HC process. Drained
brine can mix with the feed water to increase the seawater tem-
perature to the values above 85 °C, improving productivity.

Different  types  of  variable  pressure  HDH  systems  consisting
of  VHDH,  HC  and  sub-atmospheric  pressure  humidification/over-
atmospheric  pressure  dehumidification  processes  have  recently
been  modified  in  HDH  processes.  This  technology  improved  the
GOR,  effectiveness  and  productivity  using  TVC,  MVC  and  liquid
ring vacuum pump. Further research can be motivated due to the
heat transfer rate enhancement by 30%-35% in the humidifier and
27% in the dehumidifier as well as decreasing the investment cost
by cancelling the requirement for a water heater or dehumidifier.
Multi-stage humidification process, brine recirculation, using direct
contact  humidifier  and  dehumidifier,  and  exergy  analysis  can  be
considered as the performance improvement options for the VP-
HDH systems. The low TBT of a VHDH system at low humidifier
pressures compared to a conventional HDH system necessitates us-
ing a solar water heater with a higher aperture area in a multi-

up, while no additional heat source would be required during the
steady operation.

An exergy analysis of AH-HDH and WH-HDH systems driven by
an HP (Layouts 1 and 2, respectively) and a conventional WH-HDH
(Layout 3) was conducted by Lawal et al. [178] . It was shown that
the compressor and evaporator were the most irreversible compo-
nents due to the highest exergy loss. The exergy efficiencies of Lay-
outs 1, 2 and 3 were reported as about 1.1%, 0.07% and 0.06%, re-
spectively. These values show that the HDH-HP systems should be
improved  exergetically  by  using  the  energy-efficient  components
and decreasing the irreversibility. The cost analysis revealed that
Layout 1 with the cost range of 4.6-5.5 $/m 3  was the most eco-
nomic  process.  The  cost  was  highly  affected  by  the  variation  in
electricity cost, while it was insensitive to the lifespan. An HDH
driven by an absorption-compression heat pump (ACHP) while us-
ing the heating capacity of the discharged brine and power of the
ACHP  was  optimized  by  genetic  algorithm  [180] .  At  the  optimal
condition,  the  CPL  of  freshwater  and  specific  work  consumption
(SW)  were  estimated  $7.13  and  262.9  kJ/kg,  respectively.  It  was
concluded that the GOR could be maximized at the high feed tem-
perature, desalination mass flow ratio and compression ratio. The
desalination rate of 0.647 kg/s, GOR of 9.02, and exergy-based GOR
of  3.04%  were  obtained.  Cost  comparison  between  the  proposed
layouts and an HDH-ACHP system confirms that system upscaling
decreases the production cost, leading to higher GOR as well as
exergy-based GOR. Furthermore, these studies fall short in terms
of exergetic optimization or process and component modifications.
As an energy-efficient approach, an HDH was coupled to an MS-
HP dehumidifier by Liu et al. [181] . An optimum value was deter-
mined for the solution flow rate to enhance the system coefficient
of performance. The solution rate was limited by the dehumidifier
capacity. Besides, the added water capacity removed the redundant
heating capacity of the system to enhance the performance by re-
ducing the condensing temperature. Heat was exchanged between
the outdoor and indoor exhaust air by the solution flow. An in-
crease and decrease in the outdoor air inlet and indoor exhaust air
parameters promoted the heat recovery, respectively. Moreover, the
coefficient of performance of this counter low HP was 30% more
than  that  of  a  cross  flow  HP,  due  to  the  superior  dehumidifica-
tion. The potential of a solar assisted HP combined with a two-
stage HDH was investigated by Xu et al. [182] . Compared to a one-
stage HDH, the CPL was decreased by 17.36%, while the produc-
tion rate and GOR were increased by 15.51% and 55.64%, respec-
tively. Maximum GOR of 1.93 was obtained at cooling water flow
rate of 0.3 m 3 /h. It was due to the benefit of the cascade energy
utilization in the two-stage system. The honeycomb paper pack-
ing reached about 28% improvement in productivity in comparison

stage VHDH system with humidifier in parallel configuration. Ad-
justing the airflow rate would be challenging in this configuration.
The humidifiers in series configuration are not recommended for
multi-stage VHDH system due to low TBT.

5.6. Humidification-dehumidification and heat pump coupling

Coupling of a heat pump (HP) to an HDH system (HDH-HP) has
been proposed to enhance the dehumidification efficiency of con-
ventional HDH processes. An HP can be used for cooling or refrig-
erating the humid air and heating the saline water. The HP would
have dual functionality of improving the dehumidification process
and  recovering  energy  in  the  HDHs  [178] .  The  flow  diagram  of
an HDH-HP system is illustrated in Fig. 13 . The principles of HDH
and MVC refrigeration are combined in this method. This process
reuses the condensation latent heat of water in consecutive evap-
orators [26] .

An HDH-HP can be used to overcome the limitation of conven-
tional HDH systems in terms of stability in temperature of heat-
ing  and  cooling  sources,  guaranteeing  a  stable  desalination  rate
[179] . The HDH-HP process is also a promising method for solv-
ing the limitations of heating (evaporator) and cooling (condenser)
sources. This approach provides a highly efficient and steady oper-
ation for freshwater production. An HDH system with compressed
air and heat recovery using MVC where moist air replaced the va-
por was investigated. Solar energy could be applied for starting-

with the plastic polyhedron ball. Zhang [183] conducted an exper-
imental study on a WH-HDH system integrated with an HP unit.
It was comprised of a two-stage plate type heat exchanger as the
dehumidifier with different size and material. The packed bed hu-
midifier was designed containing polypropylene packings with di-
mensions of 0.48 × 0.48 × 1.5 m 3 . Heat was transferred by the
HP to the saline water by the plate heat exchanger while absorb-
ing heat from the air by the second dehumidifier. It was concluded
that productivity was unaffected by solar radiation. At an optimum
value of w/a ratio, the maximum desalination rate and CPL of 22.26
kg/h and $0.051 were obtained, respectively. At the humidifier ef-
ficiency of 100%, the dehumidifier effectiveness was in the range
of 0.832-0.901, while coefficient of performance of the proposed
system (i.e. 2.052) was competitive with other HDH units. [184] .
An electricity-driven HDH-HP system was optimized through the
multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm by
Zhang et al. [185] . The cooling and heating capacities of the HP
were 10.8 kW and 13.8 kW, respectively. An increase in the inlet
air humidity ratio increased the optimized desalination rate and
GOR by about 3.8% and 4.2%, respectively, while reducing the CPL
by 8.50%. A near-linear relationship was found between the opti-
mized CPL and electricity price. An increase in desalination rate by
increasing the inlet humidity ratio may be due to dehumidification
of  inlet  humid  air  diminishing  the  humidification  efficiency.  De-
termination of evaporation driving force rather than desalination
rate could clarify the positive effect of inlet humidity ratio on sys-
tem performance. Investigation of the reviewed HDH-HP systems
in this section had a similar result about the parameters’ effect on
system performance [184-186] . It was concluded that an increase
in the air humidity ratio and saline water flow rate was benefi-
cial for the yield improvement. The saline water temperature had
a positive influence on the productivity, while the influence of air
temperature was insignificant.

VP-HDH-HP,  HC-HP,  HDH-HP  and  HDH  processes  were  com-
pared based their desalination rates by Ayati et al. [186] . The VP-
HDH-HP followed by the HC-HP, HDH-HP and HDH had the highest
desalination rate. Parametric study by one factor at a time method
showed that changing the dehumidifier to humidifier pressure ra-
tio from 2.0 to 3.0 the desalination rate was improved by 215% at
the optimum w/a ratio of 2. The VP-HDH-HP had the best perfor-
mance by achieving the water cost of 4.68 $/m 3 . Using the heat-
ing effect of HP contribute to improving the system performance
that was not considered in this research. Modification of system
for utilization of liberated heat from the HP is recommended for
next  research.  Creating  the  variable pressure  in  HDH  system  via
the throttle valve and compressor or a liquid ring vacuum pump
in experimental work will clarify the feasibility and productivity of
the VP-HDH-HP or the VHDH-HP processes.

The studies in hybrid HDH-HP systems revealed that coupling
HP to AH-HDH is more proper than WH-HDH systems. The ACHP
can be considered as the best option due to the increase in GOR
above 9. Coupling an HP to a VP-HDH system, better performance
was found than conventional HDH-HP systems. The optimization
of variables revealed that the saline water temperature and air hu-
midity ratio significantly affect desalination rate, while the effect
of air temperature is insignificant. The optimum values for w/a ra-
tio and dehumidifier to humidifier pressure ratio should be deter-
mined for all HDH processes. Thermodynamic study revealed that
compressor  and  evaporator  had  higher  irreversibility  than  other
components in HDH-HP systems.

6. Cost analysis

In this section, the procedure to conduct cost estimation for an
HDH desalination system is described [3] . The produced pure wa-
ter rate (  ̇ m pw ), lifetime ( N ), annual interest rate ( r ), running time

during a day ( t ), and running days in a year ( m ) are used for cal-
culation of the parameters related to the cost analysis. The param-
eters are summarized in Table 2 . The investment cost ( P ) includes
the purchase cost of equipment, land and site preparation (negli-
gible in HDH process) and construction. All mentioned parameters
are introduced by P c in Eq. (46).

The total cost of ownership (TCO) concept was introduced by
Kabeel et al. [57] . This concept included the fixed investment costs,
production and operating costs, internal rate of return on invest-
ment,  energy  costs  and  some  other  economic  parameters.  They
showed  that  increasing  the  collector  area  and  the  plant  lifetime
reduced the desalinated water production cost. Cost comparison of
different desalination systems are tabulated in Table 3 .

The production cost of the large-scale HDH systems is compa-
rable with any other desalination process (e.g., hybrid HDH, MD,
ED  and  low  temperature  MED).  The  cost  analysis  is  performed
through following the presented procedure in Table 2 . The com-
parison confirms the ME-HDH and VHDH systems outperform ED,
PV-RO and SS. They are competitive with complex MSF process by
a  similar  capacity  of  10  m 3 /d.  It  means  that  the  modified  HDH
through  multi-effect  and  vacuum  humidification  processes  high-
lights  the  applicability  of  this  simple  desalination  process.  It  is
tried to present the table specifically for the capacity of 10 m 3 /d.
However, due to the limited number of studies, the table has been
extended to cover a range of capacities to enable comparison. Heat
recovery  and  evaporation  rate  are  improved  by  modification  of
conventional  HDH  units.  The  table  shows  that  the  HDH  system
with waste heat source is more economical than the system with
solar energy source due to the continuous process during a day.
Upscaling, using efficient components, increasing the lifetime and
energy cost reduction decrease the production cost in HDH sys-
tem. Large-scale HDH systems are more successful than ED, PV-RO,
MED, SS and MD. In the small scales, using methods such as MED,
SS and MD might not be cost effective, requiring modification. It
is concluded that cost analysis is likely to lay a foundation for up-
scaling and industrialization of the high-efficiency HDH cycles.

The main problems of using renewable thermal energy in large-
scale  desalination  units  are  the  relatively  low  desalination  rate
(owing to the low thermal efficiency) and the significantly large
land  area  requirement.  However,  since  renewable  energy-driven
desalination plants are characterized by free energy and low op-
eration cost, this technology is suitable for small-scale production,
especially in remote arid areas and islands. The freshwater cost of
a desalination plant can be reduced by improving energy efficiency,
using more durable materials and high quality components [74] .

7. Future scenario

Some  strategies  related  to  the  system  design  and  operating

variables which have not been investigated so far include:

7.1 One of the main problems in designing the components of
an HDH system is their size determination. Components failure in
humidification, dehumidification and heating processes affect the
system performance that should be negated. Computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) can be used to simulate all components with dif-
ferent designs, sizes, packing and insulations to effectively reduce
the  investment  and  operation  costs.  Determination  of  tempera-
ture, pressure and velocity through the contours within the com-
ponents can also lead to performance enhancement. The counters
also show the flow diagram on packings or the bubble dispersion
in humidifier, leading to determination of the best w/a ratio and
air velocity. Moreover, through CFD by consideration of the oper-
ational and geometrical parameters of the humidifier and heater,
saturated  outlet  air  can  be  achieved  and  overall  performance  of
the HDH system can be enhanced. The simulation of a two-phase
humidifier would be challenging that necessitates more studies in

this field. Limited studies are available on an HDH system based on
CFD which can encourage the researchers to use the advantages of
CFD.

7.2 Energy recovery in systems is critical requiring further at-
tention to enhance the HDH performance. Using pinch technology
through exergy analysis of an HDH system minimizes the external
heat transfers. Through this technology, the streams or components
that produce energy in excess are determined and their extra en-
ergy is used in other flow paths for heating the process fluids. Us-
ing pinch technology is highly recommended for multi-stage and
multi-effect HDH operations.

7.3 An advanced exergy analysis of HDH systems by consider-
ing ambient temperature variation during a day, chemical exergy
due to salinity variation in feed and brine streams, and selecting
a proper dead state is recommended. It contributes to the deter-
mination of irreversibility sources within the plant decreasing the
energy and exergy efficiencies. Process optimization using the op-
timization software should also be considered in future studies. Af-
ter finding the irreversibility sources, some recommendations can
be offered for performance improvement.

7.4 In the previous studies, the PV panel incorporated with AH-
HDH systems had an insignificant effect on system performance.
Investigation on PV driven WH-HDH system seems to have better
performance than PV driven AH-HDH systems. Higher heat capac-
ity of water compared to air motivates the proposed process.

7.5  Increase  in  the  number  of  stages  of  an  MS-HDH  system
makes the structure more expensive (due to the increase in fixed
capital cost as well as operation and maintenance costs) and the
design of the components more complex. Therefore, the optimum
number  of  stages  should  be  determined  for  the  practical  situa-
tion by consideration of the real demand and economic constraints.
Modification of the MS-HDH system can be a progressive step in
the industrialization of the HDH system.

7.6 Using a liquid ejector decreases the humidifier pressure, im-
proving the humidifier efficiency. It can also act as a dehumidifier
instead of a liquid ring vacuum pump in the VHDH system. The
ejector with these dual functionalities would be capable of increas-
ing the system performance. Development and exergetic analysis of
VHDH system using liquid ejector should be considered in future.
This system can be compared with VHDH system to clarify its af-
fectivity.

7.7 It is recommended to use a membrane humidifier to im-
prove  its  efficiency  and  enhance  the  performance  parameters.  It
offers advantages of less pressure drop, high specific surface area,
compactness and ease of handling. The temperature limitation and
fouling effects should be considered in HDH including membrane
humidifier.

7.8 Despite the superiority of HDH cycle when coupled with re-
newable energy sources, the renewable-driven HDH processes in-
tegrated with vapor absorption refrigeration and vapor compres-
sion refrigeration (HDH-HP) cycles have not been extensively ex-
perimented. As the results obtained from theoretical analysis might
have a large gap with experimental results, experimentation of the
proposed cycles is recommended. Experimental study on the VP-
HDH-HP  system  should  be  the  next  step  in  clarifying  the  chal-
lenges in this system.

7.9 Exergoeconomic analysis of geothermally driven HDH sys-
tems is recommended. Despite the thermal stability of geothermal
sources during day and night at a constant depth, its change dur-
ing a year and its dependency to the depth is challenging, requir-
ing further attention.

7.10  The  hybrid  technologies  operate  more  efficiently  using
alternative  energy  sources.  Combined-cycle  solar-geothermal  and
solar-biomass heat sources could enhance the water evaporation
and increase the productivity. It should be noted that combined
heat  sources  do  not  necessitate  the  use  of  heat  storage  during

28

nighttime  neither  they  suffer  from  low  efficiency  during  cloudy
days.

7.11 Other renewable energy sources (rather than solar) should
be identified in a case where integrated and mixed energy sources
are desirable for HDH or VP-HDH plants. Multi-stage and multi-
effect VP-HDH can be used for improving the system through heat
recovery and thermodynamic balancing.

7.12 Further description about the performance of photovoltaic-
thermal module and using the pinch technology are required for
HDH coupled with RO. Using its produced electrical and thermal
energies  for  heating  the  process  fluids  or  operating  the  electri-
cal components and water heating will increase the overall system
performance.

7.13 The future step in using biomass in HDH systems can be
developing a highly efficient energy exchange device or using in-
dustrial  furnace  technology.  Proper  insulation  of  the  stove  could
save  the  energy  generated  by  biomass  and  significantly  increase
the process fluid temperature.

The  proposed  future  scenarios  will  pave  the  way  for  the  re-

searchers to improve the HDH technology.

8. Concluding remarks

Scarcity of potable water resources has been major threat to in-
dustrial development. The importance of this serious problem em-
ploys urgent solutions  through saline water desalination. Due to
significant energy consumption of the large-scale thermal desali-
nation plants, their large carbon footprint by using fossil fuels and
their inefficiencies in remote areas with moderate drinkable water
demand, new technologies have been putting forward. The HDH
systems as small-scale thermal desalination plants with applicabil-
ity in domestic uses and moving towards using renewable energies
have been proposed. Furthermore, it is also a promising technol-
ogy applied for industrial water treatment. In that, HDH technol-
ogy has received ongoing attention of researchers, and an increas-
ing number of investigations have been carried out in recent years.
Despite the remarkable improvements in conventional HDH desali-
nation technology, it has not yet achieved widespread application.
Introducing and clarifying the performances of modified HDH de-
salination  processes  through  a  detailed  review  would  contribute
to industrialization and widespread application of HDH plants. In
addition to introducing various HDH plants, profound synthesis of
the results available in the literature are reported. The basic equa-
tions revealed in this paper pave the way for HDH researchers who
might not be versed in implementation of the mathematical and
thermodynamic models.

The main observations are summarized as follows:
The study of the main effective parameters on performance of
HDH systems reveals that an increase in temperatures of inlet air
and water into the humidifier and selection of an optimum w/a
lead to an improvement in evaporation rate, hence, productivity.
Since the effect of air temperature on system productivity is in-
significant, designing a  water-heated HDH  system  would  lead to
higher GOR compared to the air-heated or dual-heated HDH sys-
tems.

- Decrease  in  humidifier  pressure  and  increase  in  dehumidifier
pressure,  which  lead  to  designing  the  variable  pressure  HDH
system, cause improvement in humidification and dehumidifi-
cation operations due to acceleration in evaporation and con-
densation rates at low and high pressures, respectively.

- Humidifier and dehumidifier features, types and operating con-
ditions  affect  the  humidifier  and  dehumidifier  performance
which should be all optimized. Type of energy source, heating
device, environmental conditions as well as air and water flow
rates affect the HDH process temperature, productivity and pro-

duction cost. By selecting a highly efficient heating device, GOR
and productivity can be enhanced. Moreover, the combination
of an HDH process with renewable energy sources has been ac-
knowledged with performance evaluation methods.

- ME-HDH systems outperform among HDH systems due to the
highest heat recovery. HDH using the extraction-injection tech-
nology that follows the multi-effect concept has an acceptable
performance than the system without extraction-injection due
to utilization of the thermodynamic balance between humidi-
fier and dehumidifier. MS-HDH systems get the next ranking in
the performance among other types of HDH units. MS-HDH and
ME-HDH systems contribute to the industrialization of the HDH
system due to their high productivity.

- VP-HDH systems categorized in VHDH and HC subsets have su-
periority over conventional HDH systems based on performance
(GOR, SEEC, and cost or exergy efficiency).

- Zero brine HDH systems eliminate the nonstop requirement of
supplying energy, resulting in higher GOR. Using a desiccant-
based air dryer, liquid desiccant solution and HP are other op-
tions for heat recovery in HDH systems.

- Stand-alone HDH systems can be improved by the application
of hybrid technologies as described in this review. In HDH sys-
tems coupled with HP, RO, AD or MVC, which recover the en-
ergy from their evaporator/condenser or compressor, the sys-
tem performance is improved.

- Reducing  cost  is  of  primary  importance  for  considering  the
HDH  desalination  cycles.  The  freshwater  cost  of  a  desalina-
tion plant can be reduced by improving energy efficiency, using
more durable materials and high-quality components.

Overall,  designing  an  HDH  desalination  system  in  domestic
scale  with  a  comparable  performance  with  industrial  scale  pro-
cesses reinforce the motivation for its performance improvement
and propagation of its application. The GOR values variation from
< 1 to 20 and exergy efficiency values variation from < 1% to 75%
as the main performance parameters encourage the researchers to
modify the HDH systems. Energy recovery by brine recycling and
coupling with other desalination and power plants, minimization
of  energy  loss  from  the  components  and  optimization  the  vari-
ables in order to minimize the enormous deviations are the rec-
ommended scenarios.
