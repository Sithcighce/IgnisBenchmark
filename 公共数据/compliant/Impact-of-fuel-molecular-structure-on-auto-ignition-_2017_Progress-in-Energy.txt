At a first glance, ethanol, toluene and methyl tert-butyl ether look nothing alike with respect to their molec-
ular structures. Nevertheless, all share a similarly high octane number. A comprehensive review of the inner
workings of such octane boosters has been long overdue, particularly at a time when feedstocks for transport
fuels other than crude oil, such as natural gas and biomass, are enjoying a rapidly growing market share.

As high octane fuels sell at a considerable premium over gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, new entrants into the
refining business should take note and gear their processes towards knock resistant compounds if they are to
maximize their respective bottom lines. Starting from crude oil, the route towards this goal is well estab-
lished. Starting from biomass or natural gas, however, it is less clear what dots on the horizon to aim for.

The goal of this paper is to offer insight into the chemistry behind octane boosters and to subsequently
distill from this knowledge, taking into account recent advances in engine technology, multiple generic
design rules that guarantee good anti-knock performance.

Careful analysis of the literature suggests that highly unsaturated (cyclic) compounds are the preferred
octane boosters for modern spark-ignition engines. Additional side chains of any variety will dilute this
strong performance. Multi-branched paraffins come in distant second place, owing to their negligible sensi-
tivity. Depending on the type and location of functional oxygen groups, oxygenates can have a beneficial,
neutral or detrimental impact on anti-knock quality.

1. Introduction

PMidway the 19th century, before the advent of the internal com-
bustion engine, kerosene was long considered to be the only valu-
able constituent of crude oil, to be used increasingly for lighting
purposes against the background of a waning supply of whale oil.
What we refer to now as gasoline and diesel, are intrinsically co-pro-
duced in the refining process of crude oil to kerosene. These side
streams were at the time considered either too unstable or dirty for
household use, respectively. As such, these streams were either
dumped in rivers or burnt on site.

PWith exponentially growing demand for kerosene, however, the
latent value of aforementioned residual products eventually became
an important catalyst for innovation and helped to spark the devel-
opment of the first internal combustion engines in the late 19th cen-
tury. This feedstock driven approach of designing the engine around
the prevailing fuel is far from optimal, as the prevalence of engine
knock, soot and noxious emissions still challenges engine designers
more than a hundred years later.

PIn light of increasing legislative demand for biofuels and the
emergence of natural gas as an alternative feedstock for fuels, the
timing for a paradigm shift, whereby the fuel is designed around the
engine, rather than vice versa, is right. Why not design bio- and natu-
ral gas refineries such that they produce biofuels that compensate
for deficiencies in their crude oil counterparts? In this regard, an
attractive deficiency to target is the relatively poor anti-knock qual-
ity of “raw” gasoline. Octane boosters sell at considerable premiums
over this particular petrochemical cut.

PThe goal of this paper is to offer insight into the chemistry behind
octane boosters and to subsequently distill from this knowledge mul-
tiple generic design rules that guarantee good anti-knock perfor-
mance, taken into account also recent advances in engine technology.
PSection 2reviews the literature on trends in spark ignition engine
technology and identifies an important common denominator. Sec-
tion 3 reflects on the impact of evolving engine technology on octane
booster requirements. The chemistry behind octane boosting perfor-
mance is subject of Section 4. Insights from Section 4 and subse-
quently used in Section 5 to distill generic design rules for future
octane boosters. Finally, in Section 6, conclusions and recommenda-
tions will be presented.

2. Trends in engine technology

POne of the most important fuel parameters for spark-ignition (SI)
engines is the anti-knock quality. Knock occurs when the octane
requirement of the engine exceeds the octane quality of the fuel [1].

PIt manifests as a metallic clanking noise due to the prevailing pres-
sure fluctuations [2], which can ultimately lead to damage of critical
engine parts such as liners, bearings and pistons.

PThe anti-knock quality of a fuel is normally rated by its octane num-
ber(ON), which can be determined in accordance with one of two pro-
tocols on a so-called cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine: Research
Octane Number (RON) or Motor Octane Number (MON). Both stand-
ards use n-heptane and iso-octane as reference fuels, whereby both
RON and MON are by definition 0 and 100, respectively.

PWhether or not a fuel will auto-ignite is as much dependent on
the fuel anti-knock quality as on the prevailing engine operation con-
ditions. This section will focus on those trends in SI engine technology
that have most significantly changed the conditions inside the com-
bustion chamber. It will become evident that the common denomina-
tor of these trends, notably turbocharging, direct injection and higher
compression ratios, is that all contribute to lower unburnt gas tem-
peratures relative to pressure. This effective cooling has a favorable
impact on the so-called octane appetite of the engine (i.e., minimal
fuel octane number required to avoid knock). It will be demonstrated
that lower gas temperatures generally result in a lower minimum
octane number requirement for a given operating condition.

2.1. Direct injection

PDirect fuel

injection has been installed onto spark-ignition
engines as early as 1902 and first featured in Antoinette aircraft,
designed by Leon Levavasseur. Added benefits compared to carbu-
reted fuel delivery included avoidance of freezing and enabling the
use of less volatile, but more knock resistant alternative fuels [3]. A
further refinement of the technology by Bosch fifty years later, the
first gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine for an automotive applica-
tion debuted in the 1952 Goliath GP700 Sport (two-stroke) and sub-
sequently featured in the 1955 Mercedes 300SL.

PAfter these first models were introduced, GDI was shelved, only
to be reintroduced again over forty years later, this time by predomi-
nantly Japanese car makers (e.g., Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota) in the
late 1990s. Market share for GDI in the EU-27 has since increased
from a negligible level in 2001 to 14% in 2010 (Table 1).

PAn important benefit of GDI relative to port fuel injection (PFI) is
that the improved evaporative cooling of the former injection
method leads to lower charge temperatures [6]. With PFI, relatively
large droplets collide with and form a liquid film on the intake valves
and port wall. This results in the evaporation process being driven
primarily by heat absorption from said surfaces [7]. GDI, conversely,
involves injecting a well atomized spray directly into the combus-
tion chamber, thus leading to vaporization powered chiefly by heat

Pabsorption from the charge alone [7]. Accordingly, post fuel injection
charge temperatures will be lower for GDI than is the case for PFI.
Charge temperatures before compression were even higher before
the advent of PFI, when carburetters were still the dominant fuel
delivery system. To prevent icing, carburetters were heated as a mat-
ter of course, which manifested in intake air temperatures of
upwards of 50 to levels as high as 150 °C vis-(cid:1)a-vis 30 °C for PFI [2].

2.2. Downsizing

PFirst introduced in the 1962 Oldsmobile Cutlass, the initial purpose
of turbochargers in SI engines was to boost power in US built muscle
cars. Porsche had the European debut in 1975 in its 911 model. Up
until the late 90s, however, turbocharged SI engines were used only
in niche applications. As can be seen in Table 1, boosted SI engines
became more mainstream from the 2000s onwards and had nearly a
quarter of the Western European market by 2010. This sharp increase
was motivated not only by continuous demand for higher power out-
put, but increasingly also by both legislative and consumer pressure
to improve fuel economy. As it happens, fuel economy benefits con-
siderably from downsizing to smaller displacement volumes.

PBy means of turbocharging, the otherwise incurred drop in power
is compensated by higher intake pressures, effectively mimicking a
larger displacement volume. Owing to correspondingly lower throt-
tling and other parasitic losses, engine efficiency can increase by as
much as 18% when a 1.6 l naturally aspirated engine is downsized to
0.8 l and subsequently turbocharged to maintain power output [6]. In
Table 1 can be seen that the increase in market share of turbocharged
engines coincided with both a decrease in displacement volume and
increase in power density; both being hallmarks of downsizing.

PAs discussed earlier, GDI reduces the charge temperature due to
enhanced evaporative cooling, while leaving unaffected the charge
pressure. Turbocharging an engine, conversely, increases the charge
temperature by means of compression. This rise, however, is lower
than adiabatic compression would predict. This discrepancy can be
traced back to considerable heat losses in the intake manifold and
the intercooler, the latter heat sink being the more dominant of the
two [6]. In other words, for a given charge pressure, as was also seen
earlier for GDI, intercooler assisted turbocharging has a cooling
effect on the charge temperature.

2.3. Higher compression ratios

PThe compression ratio also has an influence on the unburnt
charge temperature relative to pressure. As this ratio is increased,
the charge temperature drops relative to pressure [8]. While a higher
ratio inherently yields both higher pressures and temperatures due
to increased compression, the latter parameter is affected as well by
a less straightforward, secondary mechanism. As the ratio is

Pincreased, the end of compression volume reduces in size, thereby
expelling a greater fraction of hot combustion gases in the exhaust
stroke. Consequently, less hot residual gas is left over to mix with
the cooler air during the intake stroke, effectively reducing the
charge temperature relative to pressure [8,9].

PCompression ratios have risen considerably over the past decade,
enabled to a large extent by the previously discussed cooling effect
of GDI on the unburnt gas temperature [10,11]. For a naturally aspi-
rated engine, GDI allows increases in compression from approxi-
mately 10 to over 11.5 [11]. For a turbocharged engine, GDI has
allowed for an increase from about 8.8(cid:1)9.6 in recent years [11].

3. Octane booster requirements

PAuto-ignition chemistry is highly dependent on the pressure/
temperature history of the unburnt air/fuel mixture. The engine
technologies discussed in Section 2 all result in a reduction in tem-
perature relative to pressure, thereby reducing the knocking ten-
dency of the engine for any given fuel. It will be made clear in this
section that today’s milder engine operating conditions require new
measures to determine the octane requirement of an engine. To this
end, the history of octane rating methods will be discussed.

3.1. Current octane rating methods

P3.1.1. Research and motor octane number

PEngine knock is caused by the auto-ignition of cylinder end-gas
ahead of the spark ignited flame front [12,13]. Auto-ignition chemis-
try of fuels in the low and intermediate temperature regime is
closely related to the fuel’s anti-knock quality. Detailed chemical
reaction mechanisms controlling ignition properties
typically
include hundreds of species and thousands of elementary reactions,
especially in the low temperature regime.

PCommercial fuels, like gasoline and diesel, are mixtures of differ-
ent hydrocarbons types (e.g., paraffins, olefins, aromatics), each class
having their own specific auto-ignition characteristics. This com-
plexity in real fuels makes it challenging to accurately predict auto-
ignition chemistry in a quantitative sense. To circumvent this, surro-
gate fuels, comprised of a limited number of components, are typi-
cally used to predict the ignition quality of real fuels.

PSince 1932 [14], knock resistance is commonly expressed as a
RON and MON. To date, both values are determined on a standard-
ized CFR engine in accordance with ASTM protocols D-2699 and D-
2700 [15], respectively. Both norms were designed to be representa-
tive of the most mild (RON) and severe (MON) operating conditions
encountered in 1930s SI engines. In both tests, the highly reactive n-
heptane and highly stable iso-octane are used as surrogate fuels,
spanning the octane scale from 0 to 100, respectively [16].

PBy definition, K holds the value of 0 and 1 for RON and MON con-
ditions, respectively. Traditionally, K was thought to have a positive
value of 0.5, equating the OI to the anti knock index (AKI) or pump
octane [20], which is still clearly labeled on gasoline fuel pumps
throughout the United States.

AKI D ðRON C MONÞ=2

ð3Þ
PBased on a combination of literature, models and CRC reports,
Mittal and Heywood [14] reported in 2009 that the value for K had
fallen from roughly 1 in 1930, to 0.5 in 1945, and down to 0 in the
early 2000s. More recent data on K shows that these authors cor-
rectly predicted K would turn negative in the near future (Table 3).

PThe causality of this drop may be attributed to ever-cooler
unburnt gas temperatures relative to pressure effectuated by the
technological developments discussed in Section 2. Accordingly, it
should not come as a surprise that here is a good correlation for K
with the unburnt gas temperature (e.g., at a compression pressure of
15 bar (Tcomp15) [8,24(cid:1)26]). At 15 bar, values for K were found to
decrease from around 6 at 1000 K to 0 at 700(cid:1)800 K, down to ¡2:5
at 500 K [8]. Note that for RON and MON test conditions this temper-
ature is roughly 700 and 850 K, respectively [23]. Data on K versus
Tcomp15 from various studies have been plotted in Fig. 1.

PA second parameter included in the OI methodology is fuel sensi-
tivity (S) to changing charge temperature relative to pressure. S is
defined here as the difference between RON and MON (Eq. (4) [19]).

S D RON¡MON

ð4Þ
PThe OI, as defined earlier by Eq. (2), can be rewritten as a function

of both K and S (Eq. (5) [19]).

OI D RON¡K ¢ S

PShown in Fig. 2, the OI of iso-octane, toluene and 2-methylhep-
tane, each having a distinct S (e.g., 0, 11 and ¡2:1; respectively
[27,28]) are plotted against K. It can be seen that, when S > 0, the OI
increases as K is decreased. As a consequence, as K moves into

P3.1.2. Road octane number

PFrom 1947(cid:1)1996, the Coordinating Research Center (CRC), a U.S.
based non-profit organization, conducted annual octane require-
ment surveys for the purpose of informing the automotive and oil
sectors on the octane appetite of new car populations. Introduction
of knock sensors on most SI engines from the early1990s onwards
reduced the efficacy and need of these surveys, ultimately leading to
the termination of the program in 1996 [14].

PCRC tests were conducted on chassis dynamometers at both part-
load and wide-open-throttle (WOT). At both conditions, the so-
called Road Octane Number
is determined using full-boiling
unleaded reference or FBRU fuels that have a known RON and MON.
These model fuels were designed to be similar to prevailing com-
mercial unleaded gasolines [17]. Ever-poorer octane quality FBRU
fuels were burnt until the occurrence of knock at either of aforemen-
tioned operating conditions.

PBased on the data from these surveys, a correlation for the Road
Octane Number, measured with realistic fuels in real engines, as a
function of RON and MON was introduced by Spitler et al. in 1967 [18].

RoadON D a C b ¢ RON C c ¢ MON

ð1Þ
PLeast-square regression of the CRC data yielded values for the
various constants. An analysis of the trends of these constants over
the period 1951(cid:1)1991 by Mittal and Heywood [14] reveals an ever-
decreasing relative importance of MON over RON. This may be inter-
preted as cooler charge temperatures relative to pressure, brought
about by mass adoption of the technologies outlined in Section 2,
effectively reducing the Road ON to a proxy for RON.

3.2. New octane rating method

PKnock resistance is highly sensitive to intake temperature relative
to pressure [2,8,9,14,19]. RON and MON intake temperatures (Table 2),
however, are notably higher than is the case for modern engines,
which hover more around 30 °C. This is because the engines in
the1930s, on which the ON tests were based, were fueled by heated
carburetors [2] and fitted with inadequate cooling systems [14].

PAs exhaust gas catalysts became more efficient and were able to
operate at lower light-off temperatures, there was no longer need
for high intake temperatures. Effective exhaust gas aftertreatment
thus made possible a reversal towards lower intake temperature,
brought about, for the greater part, by the technologies outlined in
Section 2.

PWith typical intake temperatures currently well below 50 °C,
engines have moved firmly into “beyond RON” territory [20]. In
order to take this effect into account, a new anti-knock quality mea-
sure, was introduced by Kalghatgi [19].

OI D ð1¡KÞ ¢ RON C K ¢ MON

ð2Þ
PThe octane index (OI), as formulated in Eq. (2), introduces a new
parameter K, an engine condition dependent weighting factor that is
a function of end-gas temperature-pressure history prior to auto-
ignition. Note that the OI can be written as a version of the Road
Octane Number when the constants of said equation are set at 0,
(1¡K) and K, respectively.

Pnegative territory, indicative of more advanced engine technology,
both a high RON and S are required to ensure adequate anti-knock
quality. In other words, in modern engines at least, fuels with a high
S outperform their less sensitive counterparts on the OI scale, an
equal RON notwithstanding [22,23].

PPrompted by environmental concerns and associated fuel quality
legislation, the relative contribution of the various hydrocarbon clas-
ses in gasoline has shifted significantly over the past two decades.
Olefins (alkenes) have been linked to photochemical smog formation
via exhaust born intermediate, notably 1,3-butadiene [29(cid:1)31]. Aro-
matics have been found to increase emissions of unburnt hydrocar-
bons, carbon monoxide and benzene [32]. Listed by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer as a Group 1 substance (i.e., agent
(mixture) is carcinogenic to humans), benzene is a particularly toxic
member of the aromatics family [33]. This compound has been
linked to lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer [34] and leukemia
[35]. Moreover, slightly higher NOx emissions have been observed
for those gasolines rich in aromatic content [34].

PNo wonder then that olefinic and aromatic content in gasoline is
subjected to increasingly stringent caps (Table 4). As a consequence,
the paraffinic fraction in gasoline, notably iso-paraffins (e.g., iso-
octane), has steadily risen to compensate for the otherwise drop in
octane quality incurred by the removal of high octane aromatics and
olefins.

PAromatics and olefins, however, tend to have S values that far
surpass those of paraffins (Fig. 3). In fact, S for most paraffins is close
to naught [1]. As a consequence, aforementioned paraffinic pivot
will have a pronounced impact on the OI. As could be seen earlier in
Fig. 2, while older engines benefit from a low S, a high value is
favored in their more modern counterparts. Fortunately, this adverse
impact on S has been partially offset by downstream blending of
oxygenates: ethers (e.g., MTBE) since the early 80s and alcohols (e.g.,
ethanol) since the 2000s. These compounds have a higher RON and S
than both gasoline and iso-octane (Table 5).

3.3. Blend octane numbers

PBy definition, linear by volume blending of primary reference
fuels of n-heptane and iso-octane determine the octane number of
the mixture. Recent work by Pera and Knop [42] and Kalghatgi et al.
[43] have shown that linear by mole blending rules can better esti-
mate the octane numbers and antiknock quality of toluene, n-hep-
tane, iso-octane, mixtures. However, quantifying the octane number
of mixtures comprising additional components (e.g., other hydrocar-
bons, oxygenates, etc.) is challenging because blending interactions
are highly non-linear.

PFor example, Ghosh et al. [44] tested nearly 1500 gasoline fuels
comprising various paraffins, iso-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, aro-
matics, and oxygenates, and showed that a compositional based
model for prediction RON and MON required several non-linear
interaction terms. Maylin et al. [45] came to similar conclusions
when studying octane numbers of various gasoline mixtures and
antiknock additives. They showed that alkylates and isomerizates
blend synergistically while reformates blend antagonistically. There-
fore, laws of additivity cannot be used to determine the octane num-
bers of complex gasoline mixtures.

PThere has been considerable research on ethanol addition for
improving the antiknock quality of gasoline fuels. Hunwartzen [46]

Pshowed that linear by volume blending of ethanol to gasoline
increased RON, but later work by Anderson et al., [47] demonstrated
that octane number follows a linear by mole blending response.
Anderson et al. [47] subsequently reported that ethanol addition to
gasoline showed that non-linear blending regimes also existed,
which was later confirmed by Foong et al. [48]. The effect of ethanol
blending changes depending on the composition of the base gasoline
because ethanol blends synergistically with paraffins and antagonis-
tically with aromatics. AlRamadan et al.[49] recently showed the lin-
ear and non-linear blending regimes for ethanol addition to toluene,
n-heptane, iso-octane mixtures (TPRF).

PThe effect of blending on RON and MON is typically better
described by a blending octane number measurement (BON). The
American Petrochemical Institute [28] reported the BON for various
molecules by adding 20 vol.-% to a mixture of 40 vol.-% n-heptane
and 60 vol.-% iso-octane (PRF60). While this information is useful, it
may not fully quantify the BON of molecules when added to real gas-
olines which contain other hydrocarbon components. Christensen
et al. [50] measured the blending RON and MON of various oxygen-
ates added to gasoline, and showed that some oxygenates display
blending octane numbers higher than their neat fuel octane numbers
while other oxygenates showed decreased blending octane num-
bers. These results demonstrate the complexity in determining
blending effects of various antiknock additives, and suggest that sig-
nificantly more research is needed to better understand interactions
at the molecular level.

3.4. Classes of octane boosters

PCommercial octane boosters can be divided into two main cate-
gories, organic and organometallic. The former class may contain the
elements C, H, O and N, while the latter contains one or more of
aforementioned elements plus a metal. Arguably, the story of organ-
ometallic additives starts in 1916, when Midgley and Kettering
observed that the anti-knock quality of kerosene could be improved
substantially by blending small amounts of iodine to it [51].

PAfter the First World War, the same researchers, now funded by
such corporations as Standard Oil and General Motors, continued
their study by scanning criss-cross through the period table from
arsenic to tellurium. It was found that Pb, Cu, Ni, Th, Fe and Mn con-
taining compounds increased the octane number significantly, while
Co, Zn, Bi, V, Se and Ce were slightly less effective [52]. Ultimately,

Ptetraethyl lead (TEL) was found to be the best performing anti-knock
agent, followed by tetraphenyllead, iron pentacarbonyl and nickel
carbonyl [52].

PUp until the 1970s, TEL was the most widely used octane booster.
Owing to health concerns and incompatibly with the then recently
introduced catalytic converters, organometallic compounds were
gradually phased out of most markets and replaced by organic
octane boosters, notably oxygenates such as MTBE and ETBE, as well
as aromatics (e.g., benzene-toluene-xylene (BTX)) and iso-paraffins
(e.g., iso-octane). More recently, bio-derived ethanol has become
one of the most important octane boosters.

PAforementioned organic octane boosters are built up exclusively
from C, H and, in some cases, also O atoms. Though far less prevalent
in practice, some studies demonstrate superior anti-knock perfor-
mance for octane boosters that also harbor nitrogen in their molecu-
lar structure (e.g., n-methylaniline monomethylaniline [53(cid:1)55]).
Although these, along with aforementioned organometallic octane
boosters, fall outside the scope of this paper, it is still worthwhile to
briefly review the working principles of both octane booster classes
here.

PThe chemical mechanism behind TEL’s and other organometal-
lics’ success involves their decomposition to metal oxide particles in
the unburnt gas mixture, which tend to scavenge radicals formed as
a result of low temperature fuel oxidation reactions. This, in turn,
inhibits pre-flame chain branching reactions, which would have oth-
erwise lead to autoignition and, finally, knock [56]. For example, TEL
first thermally decomposes and oxidizes to lead oxide. Lead oxide, in
turn, acts like a radical sink for HO2 and H2O2 by way of various sur-
face reactions [57(cid:1)59]. As will become clear in a later section, the
concentration of HO2 and H2O2 is very important for intermediate
temperature reactions, whereby a deficiency of said species can
effectively inhibit the auto-ignition process in this specific tempera-
ture range.

PThe excellent anti-knock properties of organic amines were
already known as early as 1919 [60]. Brown et al. [60] tested a wide
range of amine additives and found that many compounds were
(very) effective octane boosters, notably, 4-sec-butyl-phenylenedi-
amine and n-nitrosodiphenylamine. N-methylaniline (NMA) has
also been reported to be a particularly effective knock suppressant
[53(cid:1)55]. While no detailed amine oxidation mechanism could be
found in literature, some clues are provided by Cullis et al. [61], who
link amine anti-knock performance to the formation of stable

Pintermediates. N-H bonds are relatively weak and therefore readily
facilitate H atom abstraction (80 kcal/mol in aniline [61]). This pro-
cess competes with H atom abstraction from fuel compounds by
consuming active radicals [62]. The aromatic amine radicals yielded
as a result of aforementioned H atom abstraction are resonance sta-
ble [61] and thus tend to slow down the overall reaction rate.

4. Impact of molecular structure on auto-ignition chemistry

PFor a given set of engine operating conditions, higher octane
numbers require higher ignition delays [63]. Ignition delay, in turn,
for a given temperature-pressure history (and equivalence ratio), is
a function mainly of fuel molecular structure. There are ten main
reaction types in the auto-ignition process, which are schematically
drawn in Fig. 4 and tabulated below.

P(a) Unimolecular decomposition: bond cleavage at the C(cid:1)(cid:1)C or C(cid:1)(cid:1)H
bond, which requires a lot energy and thus occurs mainly at high
temperature.

P(b) Hydrogen (H) atom abstraction: a small radical or compound,
such as OH, HO2, O2, CH3, reacts with the fuel molecules, remov-
ing H in the process. This reaction requires less energy and it can
thus take place at both low and high temperatures.

P(c) O2 addition reactions: O2 adds to the radical, producing a peroxy
radical, and can initiate low temperature branching reactions. It
reacts rapidly because it has a negligible activation energy. Per-
oxy radicals, however, are not stable at high temperature.

P(d) Other addition reactions: radicals such as H, OH or HO2, attach
themselves to unsaturated bond sites; a process which has a rel-
atively low activation energy.

P(e) Recombination reactions: radicals combine together to form a
stable covalent bond, which also occurs at a relatively low acti-
vation energy [64].

P(f) b-scission: involves a scission at the bond site in the b position
to the atom (C or O) carrying the unpaired electron, yielding
small olefin or aldehyde, respectively, and a radical, in the pro-
cess. This reaction has a high activation energy of 15¡50 kcal/
mol and is therefore mainly a high temperature phenomenon.
P(g) Isomerization: this refers to intra H atom transfer from one C
atom to another and/or to a C(cid:1)(cid:1)OO moiety. The activation
energy of this reaction depending on the size of the transition
ring, which will be discussed later.

P(h) Concerted elimination: two substituents are removed from a
molecule in one step mechanism, forming an unsaturated bond.
P(i) Radical cyclization: this yields cyclic products, as is the case for

QOOH decomposition to a cyclic ether and an OH radical.

P(j) Disproportionations: two radicals react to form two different
non-radical products, typically occurring at low activations
energies .

PThe above reactions types will now be discussed separately for
each of the main carbon bond types: paraffinic, olefinic, aromatic
and oxygenated. Hereby, the low to intermediate temperature range
is the most interesting range as it is most representative for practical
engine conditions. Detailed chemical kinetic models of various

Phydrocarbon classes have been well reviewed. For example, Miller
et al. introduced and summarized the importance and methods to
build kinetic models [65], and reviewed elementary reaction rates in
a number of important reaction systems, particularly at low temper-
atures [66,67]. Battin(cid:1)Leclerc [68] and Simmie [69] summarized
kinetic models at low and high temperature, respectively, Pitz [70]
reviewed various kinetic models for diesel surrogate fuels.

4.1. Paraffinic bonds

P4.1.1. Negative temperature coefficient

PMany studies have discussed the auto-ignition behavior of paraf-
fins, the main constituents of commercial gasolines, and it is the
most well studied group [71(cid:1)84], good summary can be found in
[68]. In recent years, more reactions are considered [85,86] in the
mechanism to better understand the oxidation process, especially in
the low temperature range. Owing to the advent of quantum chem-
istry calculations, revised kinetics and thermodynamics in the low
temperature range can reproduce the experiments with better accu-
racy [87(cid:1)89].

PBased on the reaction mechanisms presented by Curran et al.
[71,90], the main reaction pathways for long chained paraffins or
alkanes can be drawn schematically as is shown in Fig. 5.

At low temperatures, after the formation of first fuel alkyl radicals
(R), H atom abstraction is the dominant initial reaction, since it requires
a relatively low activation energy. The most important reaction at low
to intermediate temperatures is the oxygen addition reaction of alkyl
radicals to produce alkylperoxyl-radicals (RO2) (Reaction 6).
R C O2ÐRO2

ð6Þ
PGiven an adequate pool of RO2 radicals, carbon-centered hydro-
peroxyalkyl radicals (QOOH) are formed by internal H atom migra-
tion via five-, six-, or seven-membered transition state (TS) rings .
Fig. 6 illustrates one possible pathway of isomerization for iso-
octane, involving in this case a 6-membered TS ring.

QOOH radicals subsequently react further with oxygen to form
peroxy alkylhydroperoxide radicals (O2QOOH). O2QOOH radicals, in
turn, tend to abstract H atoms from the C atom which attached to
the OOH group, producing Q(OOH)2 radicals, ultimately yielding OH
radicals and Carbonylhydroperoxide species via isomerization and
decomposition reactions (reaction route (a) in Fig. 7). Carbonylhy-
droperoxide decomposes to alkoxy and OH radicals. These reactions
lead to the formation of active OH and carbonyl radicals, thereby
accelerating the overall reaction rate. These chain branching reac-
tions then lead to rapid low temperature chemistry [91]. This is the
main reaction pathway of the O2QOOH, because the C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bond adja-
cent to hydroperoxyl group is significantly weaker than analogous
C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds on a regular alkyl chain. Other sites are also possible for
H atom isomerization reactions (Fig. 7) in a manner analogous to
QOOH decomposition [89], which will be discussed later.

PAs the temperature increases, decomposition of QOOH radicals is
favored over O2 addition reactions. There are three main pathways
for QOOH decomposition, as is illustrated in Fig. 5. According to the
different position of the abstracted H atom site, the products vary
from cyclic ethers and OH radicals to olefins and HO2 or carbonyl

Pradicals. These are all chain propagation reactions. The HO2 radical is
quite stable at low temperature, so it can easily accumulate and
react readily with itself to produce H2O2. This reaction acts as an
inhibiting reaction at low to intermediate temperatures [67]. Reac-
tion 6 is very sensitive to temperature. The temperature at which
the reverse reaction becomes important is related to the so-called
ceiling temperature (i.e., temperature at which [RO2]/[R] D 1 [92]).
This intermediate temperature, typically roughly 850 K, marks the
border between NTC and low temperature chemistry.

PTherefore, at

intermediate temperatures, defined here as
850¡1200 K [93], QOOH decomposition competes with low temper-
ature O2 addition reactions. As a result, the dominant reaction route
shifts from chain branching to propagation when the temperature
rises. This shift, together with the formation of stable products,
slows down the overall reaction rate, manifesting as negative tem-
perature coefficient or NTC behavior which is unique to paraffins
and those compounds having long paraffinic branches.

PAt the high end of the intermediate temperature range, NTC
chemistry is gradually marginalized as Reaction 6 favors the reverse
direction. When the temperature increases above 1000 K, H2O2 read-
ily breaks down into two active OH radicals. These radicals acceler-
ate the overall reaction rate, thereby releasing still more heat. Once
crossing into the high temperature regime (T> 1200 K), unimolecu-
lar decomposition of hydrocarbon radicals fast becomes the domi-
nant route. Now, the reaction rate is controlled mainly by Reaction 7
and therefore fuel molecular structure becomes less important for
auto-ignition chemistry [94].
H C O2 ! O C OH

ð7Þ
POwing to low temperature branching reactions, paraffins react
very fast at low temperatures, while in the intermediate range, as a
result of NTC behavior, the reaction rate slows down. Said behavior
is the primary reason why most paraffins have similar RON and
MON values, given that both operating conditions yield reaction
temperatures in the low temperature and NTC region (Fig. 8).

P4.1.2. Chain length and branching

PAt low to intermediate temperatures, alkyl radical isomerizations
(Fig. 6) are important precursors to subsequent chain branching
reactions. Only transition state rings, sized within a certain range,

regimes.

Pnamelyfive-, six-, seven-membered, have an adequately low strain
energy that is needed in order for RO2 to form QOOH.

PNote that a hydrocarbon with a longer paraffinic chain will have
more possible sites for having such isomerization reactions, which
explains why longer chains are generally more reactive and have
commensurately short ignition delay times. The same logic holds for
highly branched paraffins, the comparatively slow reaction rates of
which being the result of an intrinsic drop in average chain length
for every branch.

PMoreover, as will be discussed later, primary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds, located
at the chain extremities are stronger than those found on C posi-
tioned within the chain. In Fig. 9, which shows the ON of different
paraffins with various chain lengths, degree and location of branch-
ing, it can be seen that the ON falls dramatically for longer chains.

P4.1.3. Cyclization

PIn general, cyclic paraffins have a lower reactivity and thus higher
ON than their acyclic counterparts [63]. For example, the RON of n-
hexane and cyclohexane is 24.8 and 83, respectively [28]. Cyclization
results in some distinct oxidation characteristics [95]:

P(cid:4) Olefin yielding concerted elimination competes with low tem-
perature branching reactions, owing to the conformational inhi-
bition of isomerization from RO2 radicals to QOOH.

P(cid:4) Contrary to what is the case for acyclic paraffins, alkyl substitu-
tion of cyclic variants increases low temperature reactivity [95]
by providing more H atom sites and decreasing the energy
threshold for H atom isomerization, thereby facilitating chain
branching reactions.

PYang et al. [95] also point out that ring strain is as a function of
carbon number. Accordingly, the energy barrier for internal isomeri-
zation, along with associated reaction pathways and rates, will vary
with ring size. For instance, Sirjean et al. [96] evaluated the reaction
chemistry for cyclopentane and cyclohexane in the high tempera-
ture regime (e.g., 1230(cid:1)1840 K) by means of shock tube experi-
ments at elevated pressures. Their findings show cyclohexane to be
far more reactive than the former compound.

PLemaire et al. observed NTC behavior for cyclohexane [97,98] and
methyl-cyclohexane [99,100] in their low temperature RCM experi-
ments. While concerted elimination competes with the cyclohexyl
oxidation, the presence of NTC behavior indicates that low tempera-
ture branching reactions are dominant in the low temperature
regime [98].

PYang et al. [95] observed that cyclohexanyl radicals, at low tem-
peratures, oxidize via O2 addition, followed mainly by concerted
elimination and the formation of cyclohexene. Alternatively, per-
oxy-cyclohexane may undergo isomerization and chain branching
reactions. Pitz et al. [101] studied the oxidation behavior of methyl-
cyclohexane and concluded that the ratio of chain branching to
propagation is important, but not so much so as concerted HO2 elim-
ination.

PSilke et al. [102] included concerted elimination in their cyclo-
hexane mechanisms and found that ignition delay times are quite
sensitive to this reaction type. Al Rashidi et al. built a kinetic mecha-
nism for cyclopentane (Fig. 10). The authors report that fuel radicals
mainly undergo b-scission at either C(cid:1)(cid:1) C or C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bond sites,

Fig. 10. Simplified scheme for cyclopentane oxidation chemistry [103] (linear prod-
ucts resulting from beta scission ring opening are radicals).

Pproducing olefin in the process. Moreover, the authors observed
reduced reactivity in the 850(cid:1)1000 K temperature range at fuel rich
conditions [103].

4.2. Olefinic bonds

POlefins have a higher RON than paraffins with the same C num-
ber. The principal olefin reaction scheme for auto-ignition is shown
in Fig. 11. The divergence from the paraffinic pathway originates
from the fact that olefinic C bonds provide a site for addition reac-
tions, involving O, H, OH or HO2 radicals.

PAt low temperatures, H atom abstraction tends to occur on allylic
sites, producing resonance stable allyl radicals in the process (path-
way (d) in Fig. 11).

PResonance stable compounds, such as benzyl and allyl radicals,
have a delocalized unpaired electron (Fig. 12), which increases sta-
bility that inhibits subsequent reactions and thus slows down the
overall reaction rate [106,107].

PThe R-OH adduct formed by OH addition reactions can then
undergo O2 addition reactions and, subsequently, decompose via the
Waddington mechanism, forming OH radicals and aldehydes (path-
way (a)).

PIt can also be consumed via H atom or HO2 radical addition reac-
tion, the former followed by b-scission, producing an olefin and alkyl
radical (pathway (b)). The latter can then lead to the formation of an
cyclo-ether and OH radical (pathway (c)) [108].

PAlternatively, decomposition occurs via concerted HO2 elimina-
tion reactions, which results in the formation of another double
bond [104] (pathway (e)). OH addition reactions (pathway (a)) are
the preferred decomposition route at low temperatures, owing to
the relatively lower energy barrier [109(cid:1)111]. Note that pathways
(a(cid:1)c, e) are chain propagation reactions that produce stable radicals
and compete with low temperature branching reactions (pathway
(d)), slow down the reaction rate [104]. These addition reactions are
more effectual when the paraffinic chain lengths is short, since there
are only a few paraffinic H atom sites to facilitate RO2 radical isomer-
ization [107].

PThis is consistent with Vanhove’s results [110], who reported that
the position of the double bond has a strong impact on olefinic auto-
ignition chemistry in the low to intermediate temperature regime.
Long chained olefins (e.g., hexene [110]) that have the double bond
on the extremity (e.g., 1-hexene) tend to display paraffinic-like NTC
behavior (Fig. 5).

PConversely, when the paraffinic chains are short, as is the case for
3-hexene, NTC behavior is virtually non existent [110]. As the tem-
perature increases, unimolecular decompositions becomes domi-
nant (pathway (d)) and the structural impacts (e.g., position of
double bond, chain length, branch level) become less pronounced.

PHowever, because the allylic site is the weakest link, C(cid:1)(cid:1) C bond
cleavage also tends to occur at this site (Fig. 11). As the unimolecular
reaction prefers to transfer along route (d), the position of the double
bond will also affect the high temperature auto-ignition chemistry
[104].

4.3. Benzenoid bonds

PAromatics are the second most common constituents in gasoline,
comprising up to 30% of the fuel. The oxidation chemistry of aro-
matics, particularly of benzene and toluene, has been studied exten-
sively [112(cid:1)125]. The benzene ring that forms the core of all
aromatics has a chemistry very distinct from paraffins and olefins.

PFor example, the ring provides a site for electrophilic substitution
reactions, whereby H atom on the ring can be replaced by another
radical, such as CH3 and OH radicals. This kind of reaction competes
with H atom abstraction from both the ring and its side chains,
when present [112,126].

Fig. 12. Examples of stable structures - allyl, benzyl and cyclopentadienyl radicals.

POwing to the highly stable p bond in the ring (Fig. 12), it is diffi-
cult to abstract an H atom from aromatics. Accordingly, most aro-
matics are highly resistant to auto-ignition at low to intermediate
temperatures [112]. Once the ring opens, however, bond energies
change. As is shown in Fig. 13, the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of
C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds in benzene decrease once H atom is abstracted.

PBenzene auto-ignition chemistry generally follows one of two

pathways (Fig. 14):

P(cid:4) Unimolecular decomposition and H atom abstraction reactions,
forming phenyl radicals that, when reacting with HO2 radical,
O2 or O atom, produce phenoxy radicals.

P(cid:4) Direct oxidization to phenoxy radicals, which are also stable and
go on to produce mainly phenol, which reacts back to phenoxy
radicals in the low to intermediate temperature.

PPhenoxy radicals, in turn, can decompose to CO and cyclopenta-
dienyl radicals at high temperature, the latter of which being an
important intermediate for later ring opening reactions that ulti-
mately yield butadienyl radicals (C4H5).

Contrary to paraffins and long chained olefins, benzene displays
neither low temperature branching reactions nor NTC behavior. Aro-
matic radicals, such as benzyl (Fig. 12) and phenoxy, are resonance
stable and thus inhibit subsequent reactions, decelerating the overall
reaction rate. The high ON of most short chained aromatics, notably
toluene, 1,3,5-tri-methyl-benzene and xylene (Table 5), owes much
to this stability.

PFor aromatics with longer side chains, initial decomposition steps
are determined chiefly by side chain chemistry [59,112]. A longer
side chain or multiple side chains provide more possible sites for

Plow temperatures branching reactions [130(cid:1)135], which is why the
reactivity of aromatics tends to increase with the degree of alkyl-
ation.

PToluene, a commercial octane booster, has one methyl group on
the ring. Its RON and MON are 120 and 109, respectively, indicating
that it has both a good anti-knock quality and a high sensitivity S
[27]. At low to intermediate temperatures, its main reaction scheme
can be summarized by Fig. 15.

PAuto-ignition commences with unimolecular decomposition and
later H atom abstraction, producing either resonance stable benzyl
radicals and H atom, or phenyl and methyl radicals. The C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bond
in the methyl branch is the weakest bond (88.5 kcal/mol), making it
the most likely site for these initial reactions.

PSubsequently, benzyl radicals may go on to react with HO2, O2, O,
or OH radicals to produce benzoxy radicals. This is followed by H
atom abstraction, ultimately producing phenyl and CO.

PAlternatively, benzyl radicals can react with each other to form
bi-benzyl [117,136,138]. At high temperature, yet another initial
reaction can occur, this time O atom, thereby producing cresoxy rad-
icals and H atom.

4.4. Furanic bonds

PFurans, comprising a five-membered aromatic ring with four car-
bon atoms and one oxygen, have, like C6 aromatics, a cyclic structure
of the sp2 hybridization type, characterized by the sharing a p elec-
tron cloud (p bond). 2-methyl furan (2MF) and 2,5-dimethyl furan
(25DMF) were both found to be promising octane boosters
[139,140], having CN’s as low as 8.9 and 10.9, respectively [141].

PA simplified furan reaction scheme is shown in Fig. 16 [142]. Its
unique five-membered heterocyclic ring manifests in a particularly
high C-H BDE. This can be traced back to the low thermodynamic stabil-
ity of the radicals formed after H atom abstraction [143]. Consequently,
furans have an even stronger C(cid:1)(cid:1) H BDE than benzene (Fig. 13).

PFuran auto-ignition chemistry initiates primarily via H atom or
OH radical addition reactions at the Ca position [142] (pathway (a)
and (c) in Fig. 34). This leads to the formation of resonance stable

Pdihydrofuryl-3 radicals and C5H4OH, respectively, followed by b¡sci
ssion reactions. Other, less dominant, pathways involve H atom addi-
tion at the Cb position (pathway (b)) or H atom abstraction (pathway
(e) and (f)).

PAlkylated furans, such as 2MF and 25DMF, have been subject of
many studies [129,144(cid:1)147]. The BDE of methyl C-H is relatively
low. Accordingly, in addition to aforementioned addition reactions,
H atom abstraction from the methyl group is a likely initial decom-
position step.

P2MF, for example, can react via H atom or OH radical addition
(pathway (b) in Fig. 17), H atom abstraction (pathway (c)) or H atom
ipso addition (pathway (a)) [144]. Given fuel rich conditions, decom-
position via ipso addition, yielding furan, is the dominant pathway
[144].

4.5. Oxygenated bonds

POxygenates, including MTBE, ETBE and ethanol, are amongst the
most common commercial octane boosters. The presence of fuel
oxygen in these compounds has a significant influence on the auto-
ignition chemistry:

P(cid:4) Reduced symmetry yields more possible reaction pathways (e.g.,
dehydrogenation, dehydration, decomposition). For example,
intermolecular dehydration (concerted elimination) of 2-buta-
nol (Fig. 19) produces olefins and H2O [148].

P(cid:4) Reduction of the BDE of C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds at the adjacent a-C site
(Ca¡H) or b-C site if it is a ketone, while increasing the BDE of
C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds at the b-C site (Cb¡H) or g-site for ketone (Fig. 20),
promotes H atom abstraction at the former site [149]. For exam-
ple, in the case of isopentanol oxidation (at 800 K, 15 bar and
stoichiometric mixing conditions), nearly 48% of this C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bond
type reacts by way of H atom abstraction, and produce -hydrox-
ypentyl radicals [150].

PThe high activation energy required for unimolecular decomposi-
tion is readily met in the high temperatures regime. This causes the

P(cid:4) H atom abstraction favors Ca¡H sites, forming a-hydroxypropyl

radicals [151].

P(cid:4) Hydroperoxyalkyl (RO2) radicals can now, besides isomerization
to QOOH and subsequent low temperature branching reactions,
also react via three other routes that compete with the chain
branching reactions. The first involves HO2 concerted elimina-
tion of a-hydroperoxyalkyl radicals [152], including one via a 5-
membered transition ring, forming enol and HO2 (Fig. 18). The
second reaction concerns the formation of a-hydroperoxyalkyl
directly form carbonyl and HO2. The third and final route occurs
via Waddington type chemistry [153] for b-hydroperoxyalkyl
and involves H atom transfers from C(cid:1)(cid:1) OH to Cb(cid:1)(cid:1) OO radical
sites, thereby producing two aldehydes and an OH radical.

P(cid:4) Dehydration reactions, occurring at high temperature and yield-

ing H2O [150] (Fig. 19).

PAuto-ignition in butanol isomers, for example, is initialized by
unimolecular reactions, followed by H atom abstraction. The thus
formed fuel radicals go on to react with O2 and produce RO2 or enol.
This is swiftly followed by RO2 radicals undergoing low temperature
branching or Waddington type reactions ([151,154]). Accordingly,
low temperature reactivity of alcohols is greatly reduced by the
presence of the OH group.

PAt high temperatures, unimolecular decomposition, including
dehydrations, becomes the dominant route [154]. The four studied
butanol isomers have divergent reactivities.

PFor instance, 1-butanol has a much shorter ignition delay time in
rapid compression machine experiments compared to other iso-
mers. 2-butanol and tert-butanol have similar ignition delays, while
iso-butanol yields the longest delay [155].

PIn shock tube ignition experiments carried out at 715¡910 K and
high pressure (15 and 30 bar), however, tert-butanol had the longest
ignition delays, with the other isomers displaying similar combus-
tion behavior [151].

PThe variation in reaction rates results primarily from structural
effects, which favor one of various hydroxybutyl radical reaction
pathways. Moreover, C-H BDE depends on the location of the OH
group (Fig. 20), resulting in a unique H atom abstraction rate for
each isomers.

PAs shown in Fig. 21, a-hydroxybutyl can react with O2 to directly
produce aldehydes and HO2 radicals (pathway(a)). This reaction pro-
ceeds via an activated a-hydroxy peroxy adduct that can decompose
rapidly to an aldehyde and an HO2 radical. Importantly, this reaction
has a very low activation energy and thus is particularly competitive
in the low temperature regime [154]. An alternative route involves
O2 addition reactions, followed by concerted elimination to produce
enol and HO2 (Fig. 18).

Pb-hydroxybutyl can react with O2 and subsequently decompose
by way of low temperature branching (pathway (c)), propagation
(pathway (b) and (d)) reactions. In the low temperature regime,
however, the propagation reaction routes are the dominant ones,
given the higher energy barrier in the alkyl radical isomerization
needed to produce QOOH [154].

PIt is has been calculated that nearly all b-hydroxypropyl radicals
react by way of Waddington chemistry [156]. a-hydroxybutyl radi-
cals mainly lead to propagation reactions (pathway (a)), except in
the case of tert-butanol. g- and d-hydroxybutyl radicals typically
react via low temperature branching or termination reactions.

PGiven that 1-butanol has more paraffinic C bonds (i.e., g-C and
d-C), the main sites at which branching reactions occur, it has a rela-
tively high reaction rate.

PIso-butanol, by comparison, having 6 g-C which is located on
high BDE primary sites and no d-C, has a far slower reaction rate.
This can be explained by the slower H atom abstraction rate, thereby
favoring propagation reactions.

PConsequently, a branched alcohol with a less paraffinic chain
(less g, d or further C) will have longer ignition delay and therefore
be the more preferred octane booster.

P4.5.2. Ethers

PEthers contain two alkyl or aryl groups bonded to an oxygen
atom. The presence of C(cid:1)(cid:1) O bonds decreases the BDE of Cace : glyph
namesbndH sites [157]. Alkyl ethers undergo similar reaction path-
ways as alkanes [158(cid:1)161], albeit at far lower energy barriers for
abstraction or isomerization at Cace : glyphnamesbndH sites, result-
ing in an increased overall reaction rate. Dimethyl ether (DME), for
example, has a RON of 35, while that of propane is 112.

PSome ethers, conversely, including common octane boosters as
MTBE, ETBE or TAME, have a remarkably high RON of 117, 118 and
112, respectively [162]). This impressive anti-knock quality can be
attributed to the highly branched tertiary butyl group attached to
the ether group (Fig. 22); a common denominator.

PThe presence of this group dramatically increases the number of
primary H bonds. Moreover, this particular structure lacks any paraf-
finic C bonds (no g-C). As a result, H atom abstraction and RO2 inter-
nal
isomerization reactions becomes both less prevalent and
effective.

PMoreover, O2 addition, the main reaction route at low tempera-
tures, become less important, as initial decomposition is more likely
at the relatively weak C(cid:1)(cid:1) O bond [163,164]. Consider for example
MTBE, the auto-ignition chemistry of which takes one of the follow-
ing reaction pathways (Fig. 23):

P(cid:4) H atom abstraction from Cace : glyphnamesbndH sites, followed
by b-scission, producing aldehydes and iso-butyl radicals (path-
way (a)).

P(cid:4) H atom abstraction from the branched iso-butyl group, followed
by b-scission, thereby forming iso-butene and CH3O radicals
(pathway (b)).

P(cid:4) At high temperature, a four-membered elimination reaction,

producing isobutene and methanol (pathway (c)).

PBond cleavage involves higher activation energies than addition
reactions. Hereby, the iso-butene chemistry greatly influences the
overall reactivity, as it has a strong inhibiting effect [165,166].
Accordingly, such ethers have a high resistance towards auto-igni-
tion [167].

PLack of low temperature branching reactions and the formation
of stable intermediates (e.g., iso-butene) are the two main factors

Presponsible for the characteristically high ON of aforementioned
highly branched ethers.

PCyclic ethers are important combustion intermediates in the
intermediate temperature. Interestingly, some of them have also
been considered as potential alternative fuels [141]. Dagaut et al.
[168], for instance, investigated the oxidation of tetrahydropyran,
arguably the most studied cyclic ether [169,170], in the high temper-
ature regime. NTC behavior is also apparent for tetrahydrofuran,
whereby low temperature branching is the main reaction pathway,
but concerted elimination, forming double bonds, is an important
decomposition route as well [170].

POwing to their stable carbon ring, cyclic ethers are less reactive
than their straight chained counterparts. Compared to cyclic paraf-
fins, however, the ethers are more reactive; a distinction that can be
traced back to the fact that hydrogen atom abstraction from C atoms
adjacent to the ether group occurs more readily than would other-
wise be the case. For example, tetrahydrofuran has a RON of 72.9
[28], whereas that of cyclopentane is far higher at 101 [171].

P4.5.3. Esters

PEsters harbor a C(H O)(cid:1)(cid:1) O functionality (Fig. 24) and generally
have a lower reactivity than correspondingly long alkanes. The pres-
ence of the C(H O)O group weakens adjacent C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds (Fig. 24),
thus making a-C the preferred site for H atom abstraction [172].

and

fatty

PLong chained esters, notably fatty acid methyl ester or FAME
(CH3(CH2)nCOOCH3)
FAEE
(CH3(CH2)nCOOCH2CH3), can be produced from various plant oils and
are the main constitutes found in biodiesel today [173]. Various
types of short chained esters, conversely, have particularly high
octane numbers. For example, methyl and ethyl valerate have a
blending RON of 115 and 106, respectively [174,175]. Methyl and

Pethyl levulinate have blending octane numbers of 107 and 108,
respectively [176]. Finally, alkyl acetates, too, have been reported to
be potential octane boosters [177].

PLess common esters proposed for use as fuel include methyl
butanoate (MB) [172,173,178(cid:1)180] and ethyl propanoate [181,182].
Other than aforementioned esters are studied as well to better com-
prehend the chemistry of FAME and FAEE, such as ethyl pentanoate
[183], methyl and ethyl hexanoate [184(cid:1)186], methyl heptanoate
[184,187], methyl decanoate [184,188] and a mixture of biodiesels
[189,190], Coniglio et al. [191] reviewed the combustion kinetics of
methyl and ethyl esters. Although huge progress has been made
recent years, it is found that the modeling results still over-predict
the reactivity compared to the experiments in the low temperature
range [192], therefore, further studies are needed to improve the
accuracy of the model.

PEsters display a paraffin-like reaction chemistry, however, no
NTC behavior is found for short paraffinic chain esters, as is exempli-
fied by the MB scheme, shown in Fig. 25 [180].

The paraffinic chain of MB (C4) is relatively short. This attribute,
combined with the presence of an ester group, results in O2 addition
reactions forming alkylperoxy radicals that tend to preferentially
undergo concerted elimination, thereby yielding an unsaturated
ester. Low temperature branching reactions is less important here
[180]. This helps to explain the low reactivity of short chained esters
in the low temperature regime.

PTo decelerate matters further, due the presence of a carbonyl
group (CH O), the alkoxy radicals formed after H atom abstraction at
b-C site are resonance stable (Fig. 26).

PEsters having a paraffinic chain with more than five members are
prone to NTC behavior, as has for example been observed in RCM

Fig. 26. Resonance stable structure of methyl butanoate radicals [173].

Pmeasurements for methyl hexanoate [185]. Owing to NTC chemistry,
low temperature branching reactions are important decomposition
pathways for larger esters.

PWhile the ester functionality provides an attractive site for H
atom abstraction, it also enables another reaction path, involving
concerted elimination through a six-membered transition state ring
(Fig. 27), producing olefins, small esters or acids.

PWhether or not six-membered elimination, as shown in Fig. 27, is
the primary reaction pathway depends on the structure of the ester.
For example, MB and ethyl propionate (EP), an equal C number not-
withstanding, have distinct reactivities, which the latter being the
quicker of the two.

POne of the reasons for this divergence is that it is easier for EP to
undergo concerted elimination reactions and produce reactive spe-
cies [181], given that the activation energy for this reaction is 50
kcal/mol for EP versus 68.07 kcal/mol for MB [182].

PWalton et al. [191] found that 96% of EP follows the elimination
route, with only 4% reacting via H atom abstraction at 1 atm and
1200 K [181]. Elimination chemistry for MB, conversely, is rare, con-
tributing less than 1% to decomposition.

PSchwartz [193] studied five isomers of C5H10O2 esters at atmo-
spheric pressure in a CH4/air co-flow flame and reported that six-
membered elimination reactions are the dominant reaction pathway
for EP, propyl acetate and isopropyl acetate. Conversely, for methyl
butanoate and methyl iso-butyrate, the primary route is via simple
fission (Fig. 28).

PIso-propyl acetate is the most reactive isomer because the
branched C atoms allow for more H atoms to undergo six-membered
elimination. This is inconsistent with the view that H atom abstrac-
tion is the dominant decomposition pathway, since there are many
primary H atoms in isopropyl acetate, however consistent with
aforementioned six-membered elimination observations [193].

PAccordingly, six-membered elimination is the preferred decom-
position route when the alkyl chain is large on the O-alkyl side of

P4.5.4. Aldehydes/ketones

PAldehydes and ketones are important intermediates and end-
products in hydrocarbon combustion [195,196]. Given their preva-
lence as intermediates, it is no wonder that aldehydes and ketones
tend to be unstable and therefore not particularly well suited for
fuel use. Nevertheless, a short discussion of these classes will be pro-
vided here as an understanding of their oxidation characteristics
could be of interest to researchers working on auto-ignition phe-
nomena.

PBoth oxygenate types are characterized by the presence of a car-
bonyl group in their respective molecular structures. In the event
said group involves C bonded to at least one H atom, the resulting
compound is classified as an aldehyde, else, as a ketone. Ketones (e.
g., 4-heptanone) are potential biofuel candidates, which have been

Preported to be produced via endophytic fungal biomass conversion
or by other methods [197].

PAldehydes can be important diesel engine emissions, particularly
from those engines operating in premixed auto-ignition combustion
modes. These modes include Premixed Charge Compression Ignition
(PCCI) and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), both
of which are regarded as High Efficiency Clean Combustion (HECC)
strategies [196,198,199].

PAlternatively, aldehydes emissions arise when burning gasoline
that contain alcohols in conventional SI engines. Fortunately, the
majority of which decompose readily in modern three-way catalysts
[200,201].

PAt high temperature, as shown in Fig. 29, the main reaction path-
ways for small ketones is H atom abstraction or unimolecular
decomposition, followed by b-scission, producing small hydrocar-
bon radicals [202(cid:1)204].

PAt low temperatures, fuel radicals can react via O2 addition, lead-
ing to the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals [195] and another O2

Paddition to form OOQOOH. Subsequent isomerization for H atom
transfer, however, is inhibited by the modest low temperature reac-
tion rate [206].

PAldehydes such as propanal and butanal are very reactive com-
pared to other compounds with similarly sized carbon chains. Their
main decomposition pathway in the low temperature regime is sim-
ilar to that observed for paraffins [196] (Fig. 30).

PThe main differences for aldehydes versus paraffins, with respect
to auto-ignition chemistry, are itemized below for the n-butanal
case.

P(cid:4) The primary H atom abstraction site is at the Cace : glyphnamesb

ndH bond: the weakest C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bond (Fig. 31).

P(cid:4) O2 addition and subsequent low temperature branching is not
the dominant decomposition pathway for Ca radicals. Rather,
a-scission is the preferred route.

P(cid:4) a-scission of n¡C3H7CO radicals yields propyl radicals and CO
(pathway (a)) in Fig. 30) and has a negative effect on the overall
reactivity, as it does not lead to paraffinic-like low temperature
branching reactions [196].

PBoth propanal and n-butanal display NTC behavior. Iso-butanal,
conversely, does not, owing to its short, highly branched chain that
instead favors beta-scission over O2 addition.

PAt high temperature, pathway (a) (Fig. 30) becomes the dominant
route. For example, 100% of n¡C3H7CO radicals decompose this way
at 1320 K and 3 atm in shock tube experiments [207]).

P4.5.5. Carbonates

PCarbonates, characterized by a R(cid:1)(cid:1) O(cid:1)(cid:1) C(H O)(cid:1)(cid:1) O(cid:1)(cid:1) R molecular
structure, have been also been proposed as fuel additives. For exam-
ple, both dimethyl and diethyl carbonate (DMC and DEC) were found
to reduce soot emissions in diesel engines [208(cid:1)210]. DMC, DEC and
dipropyl carbonate have high RON’s of 125, 110 and 110, respec-
tively [209] and are therefore interesting octane booster candidates.
Glaude et al. built a kinetic model of DMC oxidation and validated it
in an diffusion flame [211]. Nakamura et al. studied the oxidation
kinetics of DEC and validated the model by means of ignition delay
measurements in a jet stirred reactor [212]. The three oxygen atoms
native to the carbonate class manifest in some distinctive oxidation

Pcharacteristics. Shown in Fig. 32, DEC can oxidize via three path-
ways.

PPathway a) involves H atom abstraction at Ca sites, which is fol-
lowed by O2 addition. The peroxy radicals, like esters, can then
undergo concerted elimination, thereby forming a double bond and
an HO2 radical. Alternatively, these radicals can decompose via
isomerization reactions, involving 5-, 8- or 9-membered transition
rings, followed by low temperature branching. RCM experiments
revealed NTC-like behavior of DEC in the low temperature regime at
elevated pressures [212].

PImportantly, aforementioned transition state rings have a higher
energy barrier than the 6(cid:1)7 variant common to paraffins, making it
more difficult to form QOOH radicals. Moreover, at low temperature,
most of the peroxy radicals tend to react back to a-fuel radicals
[212]. The formation of stable intermediates (e.g., double bonds) and
high transition state ring energy barriers are two probable reasons
for the high ON of aforementioned carbonates. In pathway b), DEC
reacts to b-fuel radicals and then undergoes O2 addition reactions.
Finally, DEC can decompose to ethylene and ethyl formic acid in
pathway c).

P4.5.6. Benzenoids

PA recent book by Boot et al [174]. on the performance of various
types of oxygenates in both compression ignition and SI engines,
found that all reviewed aromatic oxygenates shared a low CN and
commensurately high RON. Moreover, their aromatic oxygen-laden
structure lends itself well for production from lignin, a phenolic
polymer found in residual streams of paper pulping and cellulosic
ethanol plants [174].

PAs was the case for the foregoing oxygenates, adding O atoms to
aromatic branches will decrease the BDE of side chain C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds.
Oxygenation, though, will hardly affect the BDE of aromatic C(cid:1)(cid:1) H
bonds. The initiation of auto-ignition chemistry, given the stable
benzene base central to all aromatics, typically occurs on the side
chains when present.

PWhen O atom connects to the phenyl group, the strong phenylic
C(cid:1)(cid:1) O bond weakens the C bond on the alkyl side. Anisole, a phenyl
methyl ether, has an ether group attached to the benzene ring.
Herein, the Oce : glyphnamesbndCH3 bond is the weakest link and

Pthus the most likely site for initial reaction chemistry, producing
phenoxy and methyl radicals [213].

PAlternatively, H atom abstraction can occur from the methyl

group, producing C6H5OCH2 radicals (Fig. 33 [213]).

PFor aromatic oxygenates that do not have O atom bonded directly
to benzene ring, the impact of the phenyl group on overall reactivity
is dependent on the length of the side chain.

PWhen the side chain is short, as is the case for benzaldehyde, the
Cace : glyphnamesbndH bond is weak and the dominant pathway is
H atom abstraction, producing C6H5CO. This is followed up by CO
elimination at high temperature, leading to phenyl.

PTherefore, as mentioned earlier, more or longer side chains will
have an acceleratory effect on the overall reaction rate. Consider
guaiacol for example. Here, the presence of a hydroxy group weak-
ens the BDE of the Oce : glyphnamesbndCH3 bond (Fig. 34) and also
provides possible site to proceed the reaction.

5. Design rules for future octane boosters

PAuto-ignition chemistry can be divided into three consecutive

categories of reactions [214]:

P(cid:4) Initial ! formation of the first radicals.
P(cid:4) Intermediate ! maintaining and/or increasing radical pool by

propagation and/or chain branching reactions.

P(cid:4) Terminal ! recombination of radicals to stable compounds.

PThe overall reaction rate is controlled primarily by chain branch-
ing, which can rapidly accelerate the reaction by filling the radical
pool. The rate of chain branching, in turn, is a function of many fac-
tors, including molecule structure, reaction temperature, pressure,
equivalent ratio and initial concentration of fuel and air. A suffi-
ciently large radical pool
is the critical factor that determines
whether or not a fuel will auto-ignite. When the initial conditions in
the combustion chamber are fixed, the overall reaction rate is deter-
mined by fuel molecular structure:

P(cid:4) Initial ! type, location and number of C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds
P(cid:4) Intermediate ! hydroperoxyl radical (RO2) chemistry (propaga-

tion and branching).

P(cid:4) Terminal ! number and reactivity of intermediate species (ter-

mination).

bonds) [127]. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the
reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

PGeneric design rules to inhibit aforementioned reaction types

will now be presented in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, respectively.

5.1. Strong carbon-hydrogen bonds

PAs decomposition reactions tend to initiate at the weakest bonds,
BDE mapping will reveal the most vulnerable sites. At low tempera-
ture, H atom abstractions are the most important reactions followed
the initiation reactions, which include unimolecular decomposition
or bimolecular reaction with O2. The BDE of C(cid:1)(cid:1) H decreases in the
order of primary > secondary > tertiary C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bond (Figure 35).

PAs can be seen in Figure 35, the dominant C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bond type in nor-
mal and highly branched paraffins is secondary and primary, respec-
tively. The relative weakness of secondary over primary bonds
explains at least in part the significant spread in reactivity observed
for former and latter compounds.

PConsider n-heptane and iso-octane for example. As is shown in
Figure 35, n-heptane, with 10 secondary and 6 primary C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds,
contrasts greatly with iso-octane, having 15 primary, 2 secondary
and 1 tertiary C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds. The latter will have far fewer reactive
C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bonds than the former, thus providing an explanation for the
associated 0 and 100 RON/MON values, respectively.

Fig. 36. Paraffin RO2 isomerization involving a 5(cid:1)8 membered transition state ring.

5.2. Short chain length

PRO2 radicals produced by Reaction 6 are very important inter-
mediates at low temperature [67]. Both alkyl and peroxyl radicals
can undergo intra H atom transfer via a transition state ring to pro-
duce QOOH, which dominates low temperature chain branching.

PCompetition between isomerization and decomposition of RO2 or
QOOH affects the reaction route, as well as the reaction rate. Compe-
tition between decomposition and O2 addition reactions has a nega-
tive and active impact on increasing the whole reaction rate,
respectively. The main factor driving the branching ratio is tempera-
ture.

PO2 addition reactions are important because of their negligible
energy barriers. However, as temperature increases, RO2 radicals
become thermally unstable and readily decompose back to fuel radi-
cals.

PThe formation of the transition state ring that produces QOOH is
integral to low temperature chemistry, because from here it can
undergo another O2 addition reaction, followed by chain branching
reaction, thus increasing the whole reaction rate. Alternatively, it
can undergo decomposition reactions, producing ethers, ketones or

PThe activation energy for isomerization reactions is defined as

[90]:
Ea D DHrxn C ringstrain C Eabst

ð8Þ
PIn this equation, DHrxn is the enthalpy of the endothermic reac-
tion and Eabst is the nascent barrier to abstraction. This equation is
used both for alkyl radical (R) isomerization and hydroperoxyl radi-
cal (RO2) isomerization. The ring strain energy is highly dependent
on its size, with lower energies seen for larger rings (Table 7). From
Fig. 36, it can be seen that a minimum chain length of two and five C
is required to form a 5-membered or 8-membered transition state
ring, respectively. This implies that hydrocarbons, as they grow lon-
ger average chain lengths, have more options for low energy barrier
isomerization reactions and therefore higher overall reaction rates.

PRecently, quantum chemistry models have been used to calculate
RO2, concerted elimination and isomerization reaction rates
[215(cid:1)218]. The results also show a decrease in activation energy as
the transition ring size increases or the C(cid:1)(cid:1) H bond type changes
from primary to tertiary. The lowest activation energy is observed
for a seven-membered ring size comprising mainly tertiary C(cid:1)(cid:1) H
sites.

PThe presence of functionalities such as double bonds and oxygen
groups affects the possible reaction pathways and preference thereof
as a result of their impact of BDE. Moreover, these groups may inter-
fere with radical isomerization reactions.

PConcerning oxygenates, the BDE most affected by the presence of
oxygen functionalities is felt by carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen
atom in question. Owing to the tendency of most oxygen functional
groups to attract electrons from neighboring atoms, adjacent C-H
bonds are commensurately weakened, thereby promoting initiation

Pfor the formation of the transition state ring for isomerization will
also be affected, resulting in isomerization and branching no longer
being dominant later on. Rather, concerted elimination or b-scission,
both chain propagation reactions, are the main consumption path-
ways. Both of which tend to slow down the overall reaction rate.

PFor esters, shifting an H atom involves a higher strain energy than
seen for paraffins (Fig. 37) [184]. Moreover, other propagation reac-
tions now compete with chain branching. In ethers, the presence of
C(cid:1)(cid:1)O will decrease the energy barrier when the O atom is connected
to straight chained paraffins. This will facilitate subsequent chain
branching reactions. However, in the event the carbon chains are
highly branched, as is the case for MTBE (Fig. 25), the presence of
many primary H atoms, along with the branched structure itself,
will make it more difficult for the transition state ring to form,
thereby rendering the compound quite stable.

PIn the presence of an olefinic bond, the Cb¡H bond adjacent to
the double bond will have a lower BDE (83.8 kcal/mol). Once broken,
this will result in the formation of resonance stable allyl radicals
(Fig. 11).H atom transfer from C atom adjacent to the double bond
will decrease the isomerization reaction rate, because of the addi-
tional strain energy seen for transition rings constructed from allylic
radicals [107,219].Moreover, RO2 at an allylic site decomposes read-
ily back to O2 and an R radical, in effect inhibiting the chain branch-
ing process [109].

PBoth effects contribute to the high ON of olefins relative to paraf-
fins (Fig. 38). Besides H atom abstraction and unimolecular decom-
positions, there is another initial reaction path for double bonds at
low temperature: the addition reaction. It competes with the low-
temperature branching ones [104]. For example, the addition of OH
radicals at the double bond site allows for Waddington type

Preactions and subsequent metathesis (i.e., H atom abstraction)
chemistry.

PFor example, the BDE of the Ca¡H bond found in methyl buta-
noate (MB) is 93.6(cid:1)(cid:1) kcal/mol. This is noticeably lower than the 98.5
kcal/mol seen for Cb¡H bonds. Accordingly, the former will be the
preferred site for H atom abstraction. The ensuing O2 addition reac-
tion will also prefer to take place here. However, the energy barrier

Preactions (Fig. 11), which becomes the dominant reaction pathway.
This results in the formation of more stable double carbon and
vinyllic C-H bonds, suppressing low temperature internal H atom
migration.

PFrom Fig. 38,

it can further be seen that olefin sensitivity
decreases with carbon number as it becomes of an increasingly satu-
rated nature.

5.3. Strong carbon-carbon bonds

PAs discussed earlier, resonance stable intermediates may accu-
mulate to high concentrations readily at low temperature and may
even go on to produce even less reactive dimers or/and lead to sub-
sequent
[220,221]. Resonance stability
increases the activation energy towards further decomposition,
thereby depressing the overall reaction rate.

termination reactions

PResonance stable intermediates, including allyl, benzyl, benzoxy
and cyclopentadienyl radicals share one apparent common denomi-
nator: the presence one or more unsaturated C bonds. A second fre-
quent, though not omnipresent common denominator is cyclicity.

PC atoms in benzene is linked together by means of super p bonds,
the electrons of which being delocalized and shared amongst its six
C members, creating stable structure, particularly at low tempera-
tures.

PBenzyl radicals are also resonance stable and will, in an oxidative
environment, lead to radical-radical reactions, such as the produc-
tion of even more stable bi-benzyl. This proclivity lies at the heart of
both the low propensity for aromatics to decompose further and the
formation of soot [117].

PBenzoxy radicals, the main intermediate for ring opening reac-
tions, is also resonance stable. Ring opening is preceded by the for-
mation of cyclopentadienyl radicals irrespective of the nature of side
chains [222].

6. Conclusions

PThe generic design rules for octane boosters as outlined in

Section 5 can be condensed as follows:

P(cid:4) A strong weakest link ! Strong C-H bonds inhibit initial radical
formation (Section 5.1). For a given carbon structure, addition of
an aldehyde or ether functionality is not desirable, as these
groups tend to lower C-H bond strength in adjacent carbon
(Section 4.5).

P(cid:4) A short average chain length ! Short chains have a lower pro-
pensity to form transition state rings (Section 5.2). For a given
carbon structure, a well placed ether group can be beneficial
here, as the associated relatively weak C-O bonds tend to break
up the fuel into shorter fragments (e.g., MTBE; Section 4.5).

P(cid:4) Strong and/or cyclic carbon skeleton ! Unsaturated and/or
cyclic carbon bonds promote the formation of stable intermedi-
ates (Section 5.3). For a given carbon structure, the presence of
an alcohol, ester or ketone group has a positive effect, given that
these functionalities can facilitate indirect routes towards unsat-
urated carbon bonds (Section 4.5).

PIt should be noted here that abiding by the second rule automati-
cally leads to satisfaction of the first, seeing as shorter chains are
laden with more primary C-H bonds. These bonds are stronger than
the secondary sort that eventually become dominant for long chains
(Section 4.1). The latter rule should therefore take priority over the
former.

PWhile abiding by these rules will certainly yield a high RON, this
exercise will not automatically also lead to a high sensitivity S (Sec-
tion 3). SI engines have over time become considerably more power-
ful and fuel efficient. This progress owes much to technological

Pachievements, notably in the fields of direct injection and turbo-
charging (Section 2).

PCommon denominators herein, with respect to prevailing tem-
perature-pressure histories in the combustion chamber, are not only
a higher absolute value for pressure and temperature, but also
higher values for the former relative to the latter. To accommodate a
changing combustion chamber environment, future octane boosters,
as suggested by Octane Index (ID) theory (Section 3), should have
both a high RON and sensitivity S.

PS arises from the absence of NTC behavior (Section 3.2). As NTC
chemistry is unique to paraffins and other hydrocarbon types with
large paraffinic side chains, the recipe for high S coincides with the
unsaturation component of design rule 3. Accordingly, the third rule
should take priority over the other two.

PIn conclusion, highly unsaturated (cyclic) compounds are the pre-
ferred octane boosters for modern SI engines. Additional side chains
of any variety will dilute this strong performance. Multi-branched
paraffins come in distant second place, owing to their negligible S.
Depending on the type and location of functional oxygen groups,
oxygenates can have a beneficial, neutral or detrimental impact on
anti-knock quality.
