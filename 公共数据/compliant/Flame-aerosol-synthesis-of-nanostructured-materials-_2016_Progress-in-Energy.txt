Contents

Manufacturing of nanostructured materials and functional devices offers many exciting opportunities for
substantial contribution in renewable energy utilization, environmental compliance, and product de-
velopment. In the past two decades, gas-phase flame synthesis has not only proved to be one of the most
scalable and economical technologies for producing well-controlled nanostructured materials, includ-
ing single metal-oxide, mixed-oxide nanocomposite, and carbon nanostructures, but also has been
recognized as robust fabrication method of nano-devices. In this paper, we focus our review mainly on
the recent trends in specific applications of flame aerosol synthesis in the last decade, e.g., (a) usage of
a substrate in stagnation geometry with controlled particle temperature–time history, (b) application
of external fields to control particle characteristics, (c) development of advanced spray technique for doping
synthesis of nanocomposites of multicomponent metal oxides or carbon–metal oxides, and (d) fabrica-
tion of nanomaterial-based functional devices. For the possibility to improve the design and operation
of flame aerosol reactors, we summarize recent advances in: (i) in situ optical diagnostics for either gas
phase or particle phase in flame field; (ii) multi-scale modeling and simulation employing gas-phase chem-
istry, population balance method, molecular dynamics and nanoscale particle dynamics.

1. Introduction

Nanotechnology is expected to have major impacts in medicine,
catalysis, electronics, and materials science. The basic science and
engineering of nanomaterials play a central role in many engineer-
ing fields, including energy (e.g. nanoenergetic and nanocatalytic
materials, fossil fuel combustion, fly-ash formation), environment
(e.g. air pollution, climate change), and biotechnology (e.g. medical
diagnostics, drug delivery). A topic of significant interest in the
nanomaterial field is synthesis of nanoparticles with specific prop-
erties. Extensive literature exists on synthesis methods to produce
nanoparticles with desired coatings; mechanical, chemical, elec-
tric, and magnetic properties; hollow and solid cores; and various
crystalline structures [1–5]. A second area of great interest deals with
the aerosol formation of nanoparticles into larger assemblages or
functional devices, as well as ways to control the self-assembly pro-
cesses themselves [5–9].

Currently, many commodity nanoparticle products are made by
flame aerosol processes, including carbon black (Cabot, Columbia,
Degussa-Hüls), fumed silica (Cabot, Degussa-Hüls), pigmentary titania
(DuPont, Ishihara, Millenium, Kerr-McGee, Cristal), and optical fibers
(Corning, Heraeus, Lucent, Sumitomo), with production of millions
of tons valued at over $15 billion/year [5]. Compared to wet chem-
istry approaches (e.g., sol–gel), aerosol technology has proven
advantageous for manufacture of commercial quantities of
nanoparticles because of its high-throughput production, fast pro-
cessing time, facilitating process design (manufacturing and collecting),
and apparent simplicity (continuous one-step process) [5,9–11]. More-
over, nanoparticles with complex compositions, such as most mixed

oxide ceramics, can be manufactured more cheaply and with less en-
vironmental harm by aerosol technology than by wet-chemistry [9,12].
Though the practice of flame aerosol technology dates back to pre-
historic and ancient times, as used for paintings on cave walls and in
Chinese ink artwork, respectively, its R&D importance to create new
materials for catalysis, composites, and other applications have been
recognized only in the last thirty years by visionaries such as Dr. Ulrich
in 1971 [13,14], Dr. Formenti et al. in 1972 [15], and others [1].

1.1. Current status of flame aerosol synthesis

Flame aerosol synthesis, also termed as flame aerosol technol-
ogy, can be categorized in two general arrangements depending on
the precursor feeding condition, i.e., vapor-fed aerosol flame syn-
thesis (VAFS), and liquid-fed aerosol flame synthesis (LAFS) (by using
a sprayer or an atomizer). Nevertheless, it is classified as gas–gas
combustion synthesis, since the nanoparticles form directly from
the gas phase through the self-sustaining reaction of gaseous species
[16]. In this paper, we focus on the flame aerosol synthesis of
nanostructured metal oxides and their multicomponent compos-
ites, as well as various cabon nanostructures and carbon–metal oxide
composites. The flame syntheses of nanostructured carbon mate-
rials involving heterogeneous growth on substrates, recently
reviewed in Ref. 17, is not treated in detail here. In addition, the
well-known self-propagating, high-temperature synthesis (SHS)
process for materials synthesis, including gas-phase-facilitated solid–
solid synthesis and gas–condensed-phase combustion synthesis, does
not fit well within this classification and thus lies outside the scope
of this review.

Fig. 1. Schematic of particle formation processes during vapor-fed or liquid-fed flame synthesis through mechanisms of gas-to-particle conversion, intra-particle
reaction, etc.

As shown in Fig. 1, the vapor-fed aerosol flame synthesis (VAFS)
method (where combustion, decomposition, or hydrolysis of vol-
atile precursors take place in supported hydrocarbon, hydrogen, and/
or halide flames) is usually recognized as one of the classic gas-to-
particle conversion processes. Particles form via the mechanism of
homogenous (or spontaneously heterogeneous) nucleation of low-
vapor-pressure species and then agglomerate/grow by the competing
mechanism of collision–coalescence among the nascent nanoparticles
[18–25]. The gas-to-particle conversion can be driven by two routes:
(i) chemical reaction of gaseous precursors (chemical route), and
(ii) physical cooling of hot vapor (physical route). Understandably,
the flame aerosol reactor belongs to the chemical route because the
involved chemical reactions transform precursor vapors to product
vapors (with a chemical time scale of τchem = 1/kp, where kp is the
coefficient constant of precursor reaction rate). The flame aerosol
reactor shares similar routes with plasma, laser, and electrically-
heated wall reactors, but do not require an additional source of
energy for precursor conversion, thereby presenting lower capital
investment with proven scalability [1,24]. The key advantage of
vapor-fed flame synthesis is the manufacturing of products with high
purity, well-controlled crystallinity, ultrafine diameter, and narrow
size distribution. Upon reaction, the product vapor becomes suffi-
ciently supersaturated such that homogeneous nucleation occurs
to form thermodynamically stable clusters, during which the low
vapor pressures of these materials (e.g., TiO2, Al2O3) in the reac-
tion zone present no energy barrier for the process. As shown in
Fig. 1, once clusters are formed, they can grow by heterogeneous
nucleation (also termed as surface growth due to the condensation
of product vapor monomers) or by collision–coalescence among clus-
ters themselves. The clusters can grow to a size at which they are
regarded as particles, termed nascent particles.

Basically, as seen by the blue-colored route in Fig. 1, consider-
ing the above ultrafast nucleation processes, the morphologies of
nanoparticle products are indeed determined by the competition
between the times for particle–particle collisions governed by Brown-
ian coagulation (τcoll) and inter-particle coalescence, known as
sintering in the ceramic community (τsint). If the characteristic col-
lision time between particles is larger than the characteristic sintering
time i.e. τcoll > τsint, particles will coalesce before another collision event
occurs, resulting in mono-disperse nanospheres. Meanwhile, if the
collision time is less than the characteristic coalescence time, chained
aggregates of nanoparticles will be formed. It is known that VAFS
has been widely used for the industrial production of fumed silica,
alumina, and pigmentary titania. However, the availability of vol-
atile precursors at reasonable costs limits VAFS to only a few
materials, such as single component SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, V2O5, Fe2O3,

ZrO2, and SnO2; their mixed composites TiO2/SiO2, Al2O3/SiO2,V2O5/
TiO2, V2O5/Al2O3, Cr/TiO2, Fe/TiO2, Zn/TiO2, Pt/TiO2, and Cu/ZnO/
Al2O3; and even some non-oxide ceramic particles TiN, TiC, TiB2, TiSi2,
and SiC [1,2,14–16,22–28].

Liquid-fed aerosol flame synthesis (LAFS) readily utilizes low-
volatile and economical precursors such as aqueous metal salts
(metal acetates or nitrates). It was first proposed as early as 1977
by Sokolowaski et al. for the synthesis of Al2O3 nanoparticles by com-
busting droplets of aluminum acetylacetonate in benzene-ethanol,
which was sprayed using an ultrasonic nozzle [29]. Since then, only
two decades later, this liquid-fed flame synthesis method was further
developed for nanoparticle syntheses of single- and multi-component
metal oxides such as Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, Y3Al5O12, and Y2O3/ZrO2 by
Laine and co-worker at University of Michigan (naming it as flame
spray pyrolysis, FSP) [30–38] and other investigators during almost
the same period [39,40]. Basically, if the liquid precursor solution
drives the combustion process, with a dominated energy contri-
bution (much larger than 50%), then the LAFS is usually called flame
spray pyrolysis (FSP). Whereas, for energy contribution from the pre-
cursor solution that is lower, the LAFS process is commonly
recognized as spray flame synthesis, which is also known as flame-
assisted spray pyrolysis (FASP) in the literature [5]. Since 2000, the
overwhelming development of FSP technology, among all flame syn-
theses routes, can be attributed to Pratsinis and his collaborators
Baiker, Mädler, and Wegner at ETH [1,5,9,26–28]. Instead of an ul-
trasonic nozzle, a pressured-assisted FSP, stabilized by six
surrounding methane–oxygen premixed flamelets, was originally
proposed in 2002 for the synthesis of single- and multi-component
metal oxide nanomaterials [41–45]. Since then, the demonstra-
tions of FSP or other LAFS processes have been successfully
accomplished for the syntheses of materials based on dozens of el-
ements in the periodic table, as also partially presented in recent
reviews [5,26,28], which, in order of ascending atomic number, are
given below.

Table A1 further presents the properties of metal precursors
and, particularly, their demonstrated solvents for the LAFS process,
including those mentioned above. Table A2 lists solvents (and their
properties) that are used for liquid-fed aerosol flame syntheses
(LAFS). In the LAFS process such as FSP or FASP, the governing
mechanism of particle formation is a combination of the afore-
mentioned gas-to-particle conversion with intraparticle reaction (or
namely spray processes), as displayed in the red route in Fig. 1.
The ratio of the solvent-fuel boiling temperature to the precursor
decomposition temperature, i.e. Tbp(solvent)/Td/mp(precursor), plays an im-
portant role in determining particle formation routes. For high
boiling point solvents, i.e. (Tbp/Td/mp > 1.05), the complete evapora-
tion of the metal-precursor, the decomposition/combustion of the
precursor, and the subsequent nucleation/coagulation of the desired
species from the gas phase result in the formation of ultrafine
oxide nanoparticles, which is also known as gas-to-particle conver-
sion, with the same fundamental mechanism as that in VAFS (blue
route in Fig. 1). For low boiling point solvents, i.e. (Tbp/Td/mp < 1.05),
the solvent evaporates; and the precursor precipitates on the droplet
surface (red route), forming an outer shell that can trap the re-
maining solvent to be evaporated inside the shell, which eventually
results in hollow, shell-like, or inhomogeneous oxide particles at
much larger micron-sizes [276]. Such kind of inhomogeneous par-
ticle formation via intraparticle reaction is also generally known as
droplet-to-particle conversion. Moreover, in the case of Tbp/Td/
mp < 1.05, both inhomogeneous micron-particles because of droplet-
to-particle conversion and homogenous nanoparticles because of
gas-to-particle conversion can co-exist, as schematically illustrated
in Fig. 1 [5]. The interchange processes (colored as green routes)
between these two kinds of conversion processes may occur, which

further include the heterogeneous nucleation of product vapor on
large particles from droplet-to-particle conversion and the scaveng-
ing of nascent particles (from gas-to-particle conversion) by these
large particles.

Apart from Tbp(solvent)/Td/mp(precursor), the second criterion involves the
combustion specific enthalpy, as shown in Table A2. In the case when
flame synthesis is operated at high combustion specific enthalpy
(>4.7 kJ/ggas), sufficient heat is provided to evaporate the precur-
sor to form homogeneous solid fine particles, even at Tbp/Td/mp < 1.
These two criteria are experimentally evidenced by the FSP-made
products, such as MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, Fe2O3, Co3O4, ZnO, Y2O3, CeO2,
Bi2O3, and MgAl2O4 [276,277].

According to the properties of solvents and metal precursors
listed in Tables A1 and A2, most metal alkoxides (except alumi-
num propoxide), in contrast to other precursors such as nitrates,
can easily meet the criterion of Tbp/Td/mp > 1.05, enabling the syn-
thesis of dense and homogenous ultrafine nanoparticles. Therefore,
the alkoxide precursors, mainly metal methoxides or pentoxides,
are usually used in FSP applications because of their high volatili-
ties, high combustion enthalpies, miscibility in organic solvents,
and low viscosities [5]. Metal carbonxylates are another possible
choice for FSP. Recently, inexpensive, low-volatile metal nitrate
precursors for Mg, Al, Fe, Co and Zn have been investigated [277].
The influence of solvent parameters such as boiling point, combus-
tion enthalpy, and chemical reactivity on the formation of either
homogeneous nanoparticles by gas-to-particle conversion or large
particles through droplet-to-particle conversion was systematically
examined. The volatile metal carboxylates, formed by mixing car-
boxylic acid (e.g., 2-ethylhexanoic acid, EHA, or propionic acid)
with metal nitrate and solvent (e.g. ethanol), has been found to
significantly enhance the production of homogeneous nanoparticles
over that of large inhomogeneous particles. In contrast, the incre-
mental increases of solvent boiling point and combustion enthalpy
only slightly favor the formation of homogeneous nanoparticles.
Carboxylic-acid-reacted metal nitrate precursors have been dem-
onstrated for oxide nanoparticles of Mg, Al, Fe, Co, Zn, and Bi.
[43,277]. Besides metal nitrates, the reactions of EHA with other
low-cost acetates (Na, Ba, Sr, Bi), oxides (Ca, Mg, Ho), hydroxides
(Ca, Al), and even carbonates (Na, Zr) had also been shown to
enhance the gas-to-particle conversion for homogeneous nanoparticle
formation, as summarized in Ref. 5.

1.2. Scope of the review

Generally, provided that suitable organometallic or water-
soluble precursors are available, LAFS overcomes the limitation of
VAFS of producing only a few kinds of metal-oxides, and opens
almost the whole periodic table for synthesizing possible material
compositions. Systematic experiments have been conducted by
key groups including Pratsinis, Mädler (now at Bremen), and Baiker
from ETH, Laine from Michigan, their collaborators and other re-
searchers around the world since the late 1990s and early 2000s
[5,26,28,278]. Thus, given the robustness of flame aerosol synthe-
sis, a question arises: what is the next big challenge for it, as well
as its future prospects? The answer may lie in two extremes. One
direction is upward, i.e. the scale-up and industrialization of the
flame aerosol reactor to achieve scalable and economical produc-
tion of functional nanomaterials. The other direction is downward,
i.e. going small and zooming in to clarify the underlying physico-
chemical mechanisms that governs the process, and then based
on them, to exquisitely fabricate and manipulate the as-synthesized
nanoparticles with tailored properties toward a functional device
at nanoscale.

To face the future challenges at the two extremes, we should
recognize that flame synthesis is an interdisciplinary research field

between materials science and combustion science [22]. This new
field should benefit from both disciplines as well as contribute to
them in return. Generally, materials science is focused on charac-
terizing solid-state products, including nanomaterials with new
properties and devices with improved functional performances.
The huge progress on flame synthesis methods, i.e. VAFS, FSP, and
FASP, within the past three decades benefits tremendously from
the rapid development of materials science. However, most com-
bustion scientists still consider particle formation more from the
viewpoint of pollutant (e.g. soot, minerals) formation, despite the
ostensible interest in the synthesis aspect manifested by persis-
tent discussions of several groups at Combustion Symposia since
the early 1990s [279–285], as well as the advocacy for it in two
key review papers [16,22]. Apart from the Combustion Symposia,
the interaction of investigators from both materials and combus-
tion sides may be found in the recent MRS Symposia on Flame
Synthesis of Nanomaterials established since 2012. With such mixing/
merging of expertise across various disciplines, fundamental
understanding of controlling flame synthesis processes at either
atomic or macroscopic levels, rather than empirical adjusting of
parameters in established synthesis methods, is requisite to propel
the field forward. For instance, new chemical kinetic mechanisms
(e.g. based on ab initio quantum chemistry and reaction rate laws),
advanced aerosol dynamics modeling (from population balance
models, classic molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simula-
tions), and their integration with detailed computational fluid
dynamics (gas phase transport), along with new in situ diagnostic
tools and novel flame aerosol reactor configurations, are provid-
ing better understanding of fundamental processes and improving
flame synthesis capabilities, yields, and materials. These aspects
establish the scope of this review, as motivated by six key re-
search needs/challenges:

• (1) Need for controlling sizes and tailoring nanostructures with

atomic precision;

• (2) Need for scalable and economical manufacturing of

nanostructured materials;

• (3) Need for doped flame synthesis techniques to produce func-
tional nanocomposites, not only composites of mixed metal
oxides, also but those of carbon–metal oxides as well;

• (4) Need for reliable fabrication of flame-made materials into

functional devices;

• (5) Need for building theoretical models and computational simu-

lations across several scales;

• (6) Need for developing in situ diagnostics for gas, liquid, and

solid phases in synthesis flow fields.

Addressing these exigent needs, this paper is organized into the
following sections. Section 2 summarizes the development of both
flame aerosol reactors and spraying techniques that may partially
answer Needs (1) and (2). With respect to Needs (2) to (6), respec-
tively, Section 3 briefly reviews the progress on synthesis of doped
nanomaterials with various typical nanostructures achieving dif-
ferent functions. Section 4 presents the assembly of nanostructured
materials into thin films and the further fabrication of functional
devices. Section 5 summarizes progress on theoretical approaches
across several orders of scales in flame synthesis processes. Finally,
Section 6 summarizes in situ diagnostics. Sections 5 and 6 have been
less emphasized in previous works, as compared to the tremen-
dous number of publications on synthesis methods. Moreover, since
the last two review papers on flame synthesis of metal oxides ap-
peared in PECS in 1998 [1,2], there have been lots of exciting
progresses and achievements in fields of doped synthesis
nanocomposite, fabrication of functional devices and, particularly,
modeling/diagnostic techniques, which are also two main foci in this
review.

2. Development of flame aerosol reactors: trends from
“free-jet” to stagnation configurations and from vapor-fed to
liquid-fed precursors

The historical development of flame aerosol reactors, namely
burner types, demonstrates how industrial practice can be ahead
of laboratory research. For example, since 1943, a commercial
“Aerosil Process”, capable of producing nanopowders of fumed SiO2,
Al2O3, and TiO2, used VAFS to perform SiCl4 hydrolysis in an oxy-
hydrogen flame ambience by employing a multi-annulus, co-flow
diffusion flame burner [286]. Similarly, in the 1970s, the commer-
cial “furnace black” process used LAFS by employing a modern “jet-
type” spray flame burner under fuel-rich conditions, which can be
viewed as an origin of flame spray pyrolysis [287]. Since the pio-
neering work of Dr. Ulrich in the 1970s, several surveys have been
reviewed on the evolution of burner types for flame synthesis. For
example, two comprehensive reviews by Pratsinis and by Wooldridge,
both published in 1998 in PECS, presented useful summaries of such
studies prior to 1997 [1,2]. In 2005, Rosner reviewed three basic types
of VAFS burners, i.e., premixed flat flame, multi-annulus coflow dif-
fusion flame, and counterflow diffusion flame, along with one “spray”
diffusion flame (LAFS burners), which were employed for most lab-
oratory studies of flames synthesis [288]. Then at 2006, Roth
presented an invited plenary of the 31st International Combus-
tion Symposium, reviewing four basic types of VAFS burners, i.e.,
burner-stabilized flat flame, stagnation-point premixed flame, single
or multi-annulus coflow diffusion flame, and counterflow diffu-
sion flame, along with FSP for LAFS [22]. Considering a recent
overview on burner types for the synthesis of carbon-based

nanomaterials [17], this section is focused on synthesis of metal oxide
compounds.

Fig. 2 illustrates basic burner types for both vapor-fed and liquid-
fed aerosol flame synthesis, in accordance with both historical
progression and flame classification. The first three, i.e. from (a) to
(c), are “free-jet” flame burners, which are operated, respectively,
in the following modes: (a) multi-annulus diffusion flames; (b) com-
bination of inner single diffusion flame plus outer premixed flat flame
(known as McKenna burner); (c) combination of inner single dif-
fusion flame plus outer multi-element diffusion flat flames (Hencken
burner); (d) counterflow diffusion flame; and (e) flame spray py-
rolysis. The last five from (f.1–4) and (g) are all modified stagnation-
point configurations where flow from the nozzles of burners impinge
on temperature-controlled substrates. It must be noted that, because
of the importance of molecular mixedness, combustion behaves quite
differently depending on whether the reactants, fuel and oxidizer,
are initially pre-mixed or not. For premixed flames, the reactants
are already well-mixed before reaction, whereas for diffusion flames,
the reactants are initially separated and are brought together through
mixing by either/both molecular diffusion and bulk advection. Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of various typical burners that have
been employed in flame aerosol synthesis. As far as the decompo-
sition of precursor is concerned, in contrast to non-premixed
diffusion flame, the premixed flame mode of some burners may favor
low-temperature abstraction initiation (RH + O2→R + HO2) over the
high-temperature thermal decomposition (RH + M→R + H + M) of
precursor. Importantly, for most precursors, the particle forma-
tion and growth in different burners are significantly affected by the
temperature–time profile (i.e., maximum temperature, quenching

rate, and residence time, etc.) [307]. For these precursors that are
sensitive to the radical species, the radical concentrations in the dif-
ferent reactors will also affect the particle, either by radical driven
precursor decomposition or quenching of radical species on the par-
ticle surface as flame inhibitor [308].

2.1. Coflow diffusion flame burner

The coflow diffusion flame burner, which possesses advantages
of offering high flexibility by broad operational windows and safety
without flash-back, has been widely employed for commercial pro-
duction of flame-made nanomaterials including the so-called
“chloride process”, “Aerosil process” (Degussa), and, more recently,
“sodium flame and encapsulation (SFE) process” (Cabot Corpora-
tion) [283,286,289]. Other than a few applications of single jet flames,
the coaxial multi-annulus configuration, e.g. consisting of three con-
centric stainless-steel tubes, is commonly utilized so that the gaseous
fuel and oxidizer streams can be separated from the central stream
that contains the metal precursor, as shown in Fig. 2(a). In early 1972,
Formenti et al. [15] introduced the setup for lab-scale investiga-
tion on the synthesis of metal chlorides in H2/O2/N2 diffusion flames
to produce TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, Fe2O3, and GeO2 nanopowders. The
classic mixing configuration is arranged where the oxidizer stream
is in the outermost tube, inert-gas-carried precursor in the inner
tube, and fuel stream in the middle tube. The inverse mixing

configuration, with methane flowing through the outermost tube
and air flowing through the inner tube, as shown in Fig. 2(a), was
studied to compare with the classic mixing one, demonstrating good
potential for producing much finer particles. With air-flow mixed
with precursor in the inner tube, the pre-dilution of metal precur-
sor by air flow before its introduction to the flame front is a
dominating factor for depressing particle growths, resulting in
reduced size [289]. As presented in Table 1, the inverse mixing burner
produces NPs with size of 11 nm while the regular mixing one pro-
duces those of 105 nm, under an identical yield of 3.7 g per MJ heat
input from the methane. With respect to the diameter of the outer
tube, the product TiO2 flux is about 920 g/min·m2. However, a sig-
nificant disadvantage of the coflow diffusion flame reactor is that
its high-temperature post-flame zone can be very long causing un-
controllable particle growth. The temperature quenching rate in the
post-flame zone (starting after the position of maximum temper-
ature) has been measured to be ~70 K/cm (and mostly less than
100 K/cm) for the co-flow diffusion burner [290]. As a result, in such
‘long hot flames,’ spherical particles with a low degree of agglom-
eration usually have primary particle diameters of 50–100 nm (and
even above 200 nm), greatly curbing their functional use as flame-
made nanomaterials [289,291].

Many methods have been attempted to control particle growth,
i.e. sintering and agglomeration of particles. For instance, in the late
1990s, the control of agglomeration was achieved with sodium

8

S.Q. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 1–59

flames by Dufaux and Axelbaum [283], and with low-pressure flames
by Glumac et al. [309] However, as for the coflow flame burner that
is focused on in this section, it is still difficult to attain nonagglomerate
spherical particles with much smaller sizes (e.g., less than 50 nm).
The burner outlet velocity difference between the fuel and oxygen
jets, Δv = vox − vfuel, has been identified as an effective parameter to
control the sizes of primary particles in agglomerates down to 20 nm,
when Δv is larger than 10 m/s. The reason is that, for larger Δv, in-
creased entrainment of ambient air from higher oxygen outlet
velocity shortens and cools the flame, leading to slower sintering
and thus smaller primary particle diameter [290,291]. For in-
stance, as the yield of NPs increases from 4.0 to 20 g/MJ-fuel (i.e.
5–25 g/h SiO2), the size of primary particle enlarges from 13 to 27 nm
at the condition of Δv = 20 m/s, exhibiting a scaling relationship of
Y ∝ dp
2.2. The order of 2.2, which is less than 3, implies a certain
degree of aggmoleration of primary nanoparticles. Furthermore, the
increase in average primary particle diameter (dp) with increasing
yield of SiO2 could be explained by the increase of the flame en-
thalpy content, resulting in higher flame temperatures and therefore
higher sintering rates.

However, despite the attainment of smaller primary particles,
the formed materials are nonspherical with high degree of agglom-
eration. Accordingly, Wegner and Pratsinis developed a nozzle-
quenching process, in which a critical flow nozzle is placed at a desired
position downstream of the particle-laden flame, to achieve con-
trolled flame synthesis of metal oxides [310]. Using this flame-
nozzle process, nonagglomerated, spherical titania particles are
created, with primary particle sizes precisely controlled from 5 nm
to 60 nm by selecting the burner–nozzle distance. This quenching
procedure rapidly slows down particle growth downstream of the
nozzle, thereby “freezing” the particle size and the morphology of
the upstream aerosol. Furthermore, by introducing and stabilizing
oxygen vacancies in the titania particles with the quenching pro-
cedure, the phase composition of the product powder can be
independently controlled from 85 wt. % to 5 wt. % anatase with the
balance rutile. This broad operational window with respect to
product particle size, morphology, crystallinity, and agglomera-
tion shows the high potential of the flame-nozzle process to be
successfully applied to other flame configurations for cost-effective
syntheses of silica, alumina, and other oxide and nonoxide ceram-
ics, as well as carbon black and metals like nickel and iron [310,311].

2.2. McKenna flat-flame burner and its supported system

The McKenna burner has been widely used for many years to
produce flat premixed flames, which are assumed to be one-
dimensional and considered as a standard, at least under lean and
close-to stoichiometric conditions [312]. The burner had been em-
ployed in many laboratories around the world for the development
and calibration of optical diagnostic techniques [313–317]. The
McKenna burner was recently proposed and utilized as a standard
burner for the study of the mechanisms responsible for soot for-
mation, and in particular, for the development of in situ soot
diagnostics using the laser-induced incandescence (LII) technique
[317–320].

The McKenna flat-flame burner, operating with a laminar pre-
mixed CH4/N2/O2 mixture, has the advantage of a simple geometry.
Nevertheless, it has served as a model for more complicated in-
dustrial processes, such as the Cab-O-Sil process, which is based on
premixed hydrocarbon flame synthesis (Ulrich, 1971 [14]). Origi-
nally, Ulrich and his co-workers employed one of the simplest
configurations of McKenna, i.e. primary premixed flat-flame without
introducing a secondary jet flame at the center of burner. Using C3H8/
O2/SiCl4 mixtures, as shown in Fig. 2(b), they studied the synthesis
of SiO2 nanopowders [321,322]. The experimental data of particle
growth were consistent with those predicted by a simple Brownian

collision–coalescence model for residence times ranging from 30
to 100 ms, using a sticking coefficient as 0.004. Two decades later,
Ehrman et al. (1998) [292] employed a similar primary premixed
flame McKenna burner, as shown in Fig. 2(b), to generate SiO2/
TiO2 nanocomposite nanoparticles (~15 nm). The McKenna burner
generally consists of a gravity sintered bronze plug that is encased
in a stainless steel sleeve and sealed with O-rings. A radially uniform
premixed flame was stabilized approximately 1.5 mm above the
surface of the burner. To prevent sintering of the burner surface, a
cooling coil circulating chilled house water was built into the plug
during the gravity sintering step, positioned parallel to and 1 cm
below the surface [292]. In this premixed flame environment, the
high concentrations of radical species imply that the precursor ox-
idation chemistries are dominated by reactions involving radicals,
and therefore are very fast relative to particle formation pro-
cesses. Thus, for this flame configuration, chemical processes are
not rate determining for particle size and do not affect the arrange-
ment of species for mixed-oxides.

In the early studies of Ulrich and co-workers, the McKenna pre-
mixed flat-flame burner was often used as a surrounding shroud
to support a central secondary turbulent-jet diffusion flame [323].
Therefore, the McKenna burner can be easily modified to be a flame-
assisted spray synthesis burner to produce mixed oxide materials
by introducing additional liquid or solid precursor reactants into the
central tube. Other notable applications of the McKenna burner
include the synthesis of non-oxide Si3N4 nanoparticles by using SiH4/
NH3/N2H4 reactants [281], along with the evaluation of electric effects
on the synthesis of SiO2 nanoparticles [324].

Generally, the simple one-dimensional geometry of the McKenna
flat-flame burner enables it to be one of the “prototypical” reactors
for fundamental study of the evolution of particle growth, extend-
ing to the related model developments and validations [325]. The
yield of TiO2 nanoparticles broadly ranges from 0.27 to 15.0 g/MJ-
fuel, with product flux of 8–800 g/min·m2, which can well simulate
the nanoparticle conditions of industrial units in the laboratory (as
seen in Table 1). For example, the simultaneous monitoring of the
growth of both nanoparticles and aggregates was performed using
a McKenna premixed flat flame, as characterized by in situ ultra-
small-angle x-ray scattering [293], by rapid thermophoretic sampling
with off-line analysis of transmission electron microscope images
[294,295], and by in situ particle mass spectrometry (PMS) from mo-
lecular beam sampling to extract particles from low-pressure
premixed flat flames [326,327]. However, so far the scalable appli-
cation of the McKenna burner has not been reported.

2.3. Hencken flat-flame burner

In parallel to the McKenna premixed flat-flame burner, the so-
called Hencken flat-flame burner operating in the diffusion flame
regime has been also widely used for calibration of both optical (e.g.
laser diagnostics) and physical (e.g. thermocouples) probes in the
combustion science community [316,328]. The surface-mixing
Hencken burner, which consists of a ceramic honeycomb supporting
hundreds of stainless steel tubes (with extra-small I.D. ~0.5–
1.5 mm), can generate hundreds of multi-element, non-premixed-
flamelets, producing an overall scalar profile that is radially-flat,
uniform, steady, and nearly adiabatic under the correct flow con-
ditions, as shown as primary flames in Fig. 2(c). Therefore, it is also
termed as the multi-element diffusion-flame burner (MEDB) or near-
adiabatic flat-flame burner in the combustion community [296,328].
Compared to the McKenna burner, the Hencken burner possesses
several advantages. Firstly, it does not need an additional cooling
coil system to prevent the sintering of the burner surface. Second-
ly, since it operates in the diffusion flame mode, global “lean” and
“rich” flammability limits of the Hencken burner are much wider
than those of the McKenna burner. As such, more flexibility exists

for adjusting operating conditions of hot gaseous environments for
any existent applications, including diagnostics calibration, coal or
particle fuel combustion, and flame synthesis. Thirdly, as mixing
occurs outside the body of the burner, atmospheric flames using
relatively high concentrations of pyrophoric precursors can be safely
studied using the Hencken burner without risk of flashback. Fourthly,
though the Hencken burner consists of a large number of small dif-
fusion flames, the rapid mixing and subsequent formation of a
slightly dimpled flame surface or sheet may be approximately de-
scribed using adiabatic premixed equilibrium.

Initially, the Hencken flat-flame burner was widely used to
provide a uniform hot ambience, either O2 rich or O2 free, for study-
ing the characteristics of coal devolatilization/combustion processes,
in which coal particles are entrained by a N2 carrier gas stream
and then fed into a central tube with a relatively larger diameter
(2–4 mm in contrast to 0.5–1.5 mm of Hencken elementary tube)
[329–332]. The center coal-loaded jet stream forms a secondary dif-
fusion flame that is much longer than the primary flat flame arrays,
as shown in Fig. 2(c).

Considering the aforementioned advantages of the Hencken
burner, Wooldridge and co-workers employed it for flame synthe-
sis of nanomaterials, e.g., SiO2, SnO2, Au-doped SnO2 nanocomposites,
etc. [296–300]. First, in their early design for producing single-
component SiO2, the primary flat flame is solely employed, in which
173 stainless-steel fuel tubes (I.D. 0.508 mm) carrying H2/Ar/SiH4
mixtures, surrounded by 480 total oxidizer channels (each fuel tube
by six oxidizer channel), was arranged in a square 2.54 cm Hastalloy
honeycomb matrix. The multi-element flat flame is shrouded by N2
flow and a square optical chimney to isolate the synthesis envi-
ronment and extend the high-temperature conditions. The typical
operating conditions of the Hencken burner was reported to have
temperatures in the core region of T = 900–1660 K, global equiva-
lence ratios of Φ = 0.5–2.2, and silane loadings of 0.15–0.41% (mole
basis, percentage of all SiH4/H2/O2/Ar reactants), resulting in the silica
production rates of 1.2–4.1 mg/s (corresponding to SiO2 yields of
3.8–5.3 g/MJ-fuel or mass flux of 112–376 g/min·m2) [296]. More
recently, the second successful application of Hencken flat flame
was to employ hundreds of fuel tube array (I.D. = 0.5 mm) as a hot
oxidative environment to support a gaseous synthesis process of
Au- or Al-doped SnO2 nanocomposite, in which a central fuel tube
(I.D.=0.85 mm), isolated from the main fuel tube array, was used to
feed both gas precursors (tetramethyl tin, TMT) and solid precur-
sors (e.g., gold acetate) [298–300]. The results indicate that metal
acetates can provide an excellent source for metal additives in flame
synthesis environments, yielding gold particles encapsulated in a
layer of SnO2 with excellent sensor response and time resolution.
As for further extended applications of Hencken burner, more
recently, Zheng and co-workers [191,192] have demonstrated a new
economical and scalable flame-assisted chemical vapor deposi-
tion (CVD) method (instead of flame aerosol synthesis) to grow one-
dimensional (1D) metal oxide nanostructures by directly oxidizing
metals in the postflame region of a multi-element flat flame. The
1-D metal oxide materials include aligned γ-Fe2O3 nanoflake, CuO
nanoneedle arrays, and single, branched, and flower-like α-MoO3
nanobelt arrays. The γ-Fe2O3 nanoflakes and CuO nanoneedles grow
by a solid diffusion mechanism are single or bicrystals, and are
aligned perpendicularly to the substrate with a large surface cov-
erage density. The growth rate, morphology, and surface coverage
density of the 1D metal oxide materials can be flexibly controlled
by varying the flame equivalence ratio (0.8–1.4), the source tem-
perature (500–800 °C), the growth substrate temperature (400–
700 °C), and the material and morphology of the growth substrate.
In addition, a novel flame synthesis method developed by Tse and
co-workers [333–336] by utilizing a multi-element inverse diffusion
burner, in which most of the fuel does not pass through the oxi-
dation zone in underventilated flames, is demonstrated to be well

suited for synthesizing carbon-based nanostructures, such as carbon
nanotubes and graphene.

These advantages and wide applications of the Hencken burner
demonstrate its important role in future studies of flame synthesis.
As mentioned above (Fig. 1), the competing mechanisms of collision–
coalescence is of significance in determining the growing sizes and
morphologies of synthesized nanoparticles. More than the charac-
teristic collision time (τcoll), the characteristic coalescence time (τsint,
also known as sintering time) is very sensitive to the temperature.
Claims from previous data have been made that the lateral thermal
uniformity of the Hencken burner possesses comparable or better
quality than that found in the McKenna burner [296,326], affording
fundamental study of the coalescence/sintering rate of nanoparticles
at high temperatures. The one-dimensional post-flame tempera-
ture dependence as a function of axial coordinate greatly simplifies
theoretical interpretation of experimental data. Among all bench-
mark burners, the Hencken burner, due to these distinct advantages,
seems to provide an “ideal” platform for nano-aerosol character-
ization using in situ optical diagnostics, as well as doped synthesis
of nanocomposites via. vapor-fed, liquid-fed or even solid-fed routes
[301,336,337]. For example, Li and co-workers developed a new flame
configuration, consisting of a secondary premixed jet flame (Bunsen
burner) shrouded by a multi-element diffusion flame (Hencken
burner), to demonstrate the in situ two-dimensional imaging of
nucleation–coagulation processes of TiO2 in flames, for the first time,
by using laser-driven localized nanoplasmas [302,303].

2.4. Counterflow diffusion flame burner

The counterflow diffusion flame burner, known as one of the
typical stagnation-point flames, possesses a quasi one-dimensional
geometry that is different than those of the McKenna burner and
the Hencken burner. It was first utilized by Chung and Katz [304],
then developed by Zachariah, Katz and co-workers [305,338–343],
and later adapted by Rosner and co-workers [21,344,345], for the
atmospheric pressure synthesis of both single oxides such as SiO2,
Al2O3, and TiO2, and multi-component oxides, such as TiO2/SiO2, Al2O3/
SiO2, and SiO2/GeO2.

The burner consists of two vertically opposed nozzles of rect-
angular (or cylindrical) cross section separated by a certain distance
(e.g. around 15 mm in Refs. 304 and 345). The fuel (either H2 or CH4
diluted with inert gas) flows upward from the lower tube, and the
oxidizer (O2 diluted with inert gas) flows downward from the upper
tube, forming a thin flame sheet with temperature that can be well
controlled by adjusting the flow-rate of dilution gas, as shown in
Fig. 2(d). The counterflow diffusion flame has several advantages as
one of the bench-scale flame aerosol reactors. First, the counterflow
burner provides a near-adiabatic flat flame (similar to the Hencken
burner), reducing the complexity in modeling, where the lateral/
radial temperature profiles in the burner core region have variations
of less than 25 K (~2% variations from mean value) [304]. Second,
in contrast to uniformness of lateral/radial temperature profiles, the
gradients of axial temperature on either side of the reaction zone
are very high (ca. 4500 K/cm), which are larger than those charac-
teristic of the post-flame cooling regions of the coflow diffusion flame
burner, the McKenna flat-flame burner, and the Hencken flat-
flame burner (commonly less than 100 K/cm) [21]. Therefore, further
agglomeration of as-synthesized nanoparticles is limited, and the
formation of spherical-shaped nanoparticles with low degree of ag-
glomeration is enabled, though the sizes of primary particles
are quite similar to those produced by other typical burners (as
shown in Table 1). Hence, the counterflow burner serves as an “ideal”
reactor for fundamental study of the formation mechanisms of
nonagglomerated spherical particles.

In counterflow diffusion flames, the synthesized (or intro-
duced) oxide particles are subjected to two main competing forces:

10

S.Q. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 1–59

and optimization of transport and kinetics models, as they can be
simulated using a simple one-dimensional hydrodynamic model
[346]. Since the mixture of fuel, oxidizer, precursor species, and inert
gas flow together out from the nozzle toward the plate, the jet-
wall stagnation flame mostly operates in premixed mode, and is thus
termed premixed stagnation flame in the combustion community
[347]. Fig. 3 shows the axial profiles of temperature, velocity, and
molar fractions of species C2H4 (fuel) and CO2 (product) along the
centerline of a typical premixed stagnation flame (mixture: 3.96%-
C2H4/26.53%-O2/69.51%-Ar; equivalence ratio: Φ = 0.45; configuration:
I.D. 1 cm nozzle with nozzle–substrate distance 3.4 cm), as re-
plotted from the literature [348]. In the particle nucleation/
growth zone after the reaction zone (close to peak temperature
position), the axial temperature gradient is as large as 5 × 104 K/cm,
which is larger than the 4500 K/cm in the counterflow diffusion flame
mentioned above, and dramatically larger than those in coflow dif-
fusion flames produced by McKenna and Hencken burners
(~100 K/cm without special quenching), as compared in Table 1. This
steep temperature gradient induces a fairly large thermophoretic
velocity that drives nanoparticle deposition on the substrate.

In the field of materials synthesis, premixed stagnation-point
flames are of significance in many industrial applications, such as
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of polycrystalline diamond films,
modification of thin polymer films, and alteration of metal sur-
faces to create carbides. For example, in the late 1990s, uniform
diamond deposition was demonstrated by Murayama and Uchida
in a fuel-rich acetylene–oxygen–hydrogen (C2H2/O2/H2 mixture) flat
flame stabilized in the stagnation region of a molybdenum sub-
strate [349,350]. Numerical simulation of the temperature profiles
in the region near the deposition substrate indicated that this par-
ticular flame configuration can achieve uniform and high-quality
polycrystalline films, along with the potential of scaling for the de-
position of large-area films [351]. The simulation was validated by
in situ temperature measurements using coherent anti-Stokes Raman
scattering (CARS) spectroscopy of H2 [352].

viscous drag forces due to the gas flow, and thermophoretic forces
due to the sharp temperature gradient. Thus, a particle stagnation
plane (PSP) can be defined at a location where particles then have
zero mean axial velocity, that is, the axial component of the par-
ticle thermophoretic velocity is equal to the axial component of the
local gas velocity but of opposite direction. For example, in a 15 mm-
separation-distance counterflow burner under given conditions in
Ref. 21, the PSP occurs at a distance of z = 8.7 mm above the fuel
tube, as measured from the falloff of the light scattering signal, where
the flame sheet (defined as the location of peak temperature) occurs
at z = 6.3 mm, which is below PSP location. The gas stagnation plane
(GSP) is estimated to be a little below the particle stagnation plane
(i.e. z = 8.5 mm) [21]. Another work reported their PSP occurring at
z = 10.2 mm and the flame location at z = 6.7 mm, with the dis-
tance between the two nozzles also at 15 mm [345]. Within this
flame structure, particles formed on the fuel side can pass through
the high-temperature reaction zone and stop at the PSP plane. Con-
sequently, by adjusting the positions of the PSP and the flame (as
well as its temperature), the temperature–time history of the par-
ticles can be controlled to produce nanopowders with specific phases
and sizes. For example, Xing et al. found that the mean “primary”
particle diameters of Al2O3 range from 13 to 47 nm and the yields
vary from 0.05 to 0.4 g/MJ-fuel in Al(CH3)3/CH4/O2/N2 counterflow
diffusion flames [21]. Zachariah et al. found dp of SiO2 in the range
of 30–150 nm in SiH4/CH2/O2/Ar counterflow diffusion flames [305].
In exploring the applications of the bench-scale counterflow
burner, it is noted that the differences in the chemical reactions of
the precursors could affect particle size for single component oxide
nanoparticles and arrangement of species for multicomponent
nanocomposites. The precursor chemistry effect was successfully
clarified by using a counterflow diffusion flame to comparatively
study the formation of SiO2 particles from different precursors, i.e.,
silane, hexamethyl disiloxane (HMDS) and tetramethyl silane (TMS)
[339]. By monitoring using in situ light scattering diagnostics, SiO2
particles formed from silane were detected at the earliest location
in the flame, followed by silica particles formed from HMDS, and
then by those from TMS, explaining the detailed reaction chemis-
try given in Section 6.1.

The precursor chemistry effect was further investigated in binary
aerosol systems by synthesizing SiO2/TiO2, SiO2/GeO2, and Al2O3/
SiO2 mixed oxides using the counterflow diffusion burner [341,342].
Light scattering observations showed that TiO2 particles form before
SiO2 particles do during simultaneous seeding of TiCl4 and SiCl4.

Here we make a brief comparison between two kinds of flat flame
configurations, i.e. counterflow diffusion and McKenna premixed
flames. For the premixed flame, all gaseous species, including pre-
cursors, experience a short preheating zone prior to passing through
the reaction zone with high concentrations of radical species such
as O, OH, and H. In contrast, for the counterflow diffusion flame with
separated fuel/oxidizer flow, the temperature–time profile of the
burner can be varied by adjusting the particle stagnation plane. The
radical-release reactions intensively occur in the plane-like flame
zone in the middle and diffuse to the surrounding. Thus, these
radical-driven decomposition reactions are prone to happen in the
narrow flame zone. In the case of multi-element flame synthesis
with different precursor chemistries, the employment of a certain
burner would make a difference in the particle morphology. These
aspects are reviewed in detail later in Section 3.

2.5. Premixed stagnation flame burner

In contrast to the opposed-jet stagnation flow in counterflow
burners, a jet-wall configuration provides another alternative to study
pertinent chemical phenomena in planar (quasi one-dimensional),
aerodynamically-strained flames. These stagnation flat flames
provide an invaluable test apparatus for development, validation,

69.51%-Ar; equivalence ratio: Φ = 0.45; configuration: I.D. 1 cm nozzle with nozzle–
substrate distance 3.4 cm), as adapted from literature [348]. The steepest temperature
gradient at the cold stagnation plate can be as large as 5 × 104 K/cm.

thin films by several

More recently, premixed stagnation flames have been devel-
oped for the one-step synthesis of ultrafine, high-purity nanoparticles
(with sizes of < 10 nm), with further fabrication of the related
functional
research investigators
[114,128,137,306,353–359]. From these studies, it can be summa-
rized that, in the jet-wall stagnation-point geometry, the cooled
stagnation substrate provides many advantages for nanomaterial
synthesis, such as: (i) steep temperature gradient for ultrafine
nanoparticle production, (ii) controllable particle temperature his-
tories based on burner–substrate distance to reduce agglomeration,
(iii) flame stabilization by stagnation wall, (iv) collection source for
nanoparticles deposition by thermophoresis, (v) adjustable sub-
strate temperature for nanoporous film formation, and (vi) uniform
electric field application. These advantages provide a sufficient reason
that the jet-wall configuration, instead of the opposed-jet
counterflow configuration, is commonly used in the flame synthe-
sis. (To the best of our knowledge, the application of counterflow
premixed flames in materials synthesis is relatively scarce.) However,
the jet-wall configuration intrinsically results in nonadiabatic flames
because of heat loss to the substrate wall, which is different than
that the near-adiabatic counterflow premixed flame given the sym-
metry of the dual flame configuration. The cool stagnation substrate
wall introduces a heat sink to the flow, and for sufficiently large
degrees of cooling, along with sufficiently large rates of strain, ex-
tinction will be induced (Libby and Williams, 1983 [360]).

To stabilize the jet-wall premixed stagnation flame for a suffi-
ciently long operational duration for materials synthesis, several
techniques have been developed. First, a natural stabilization method
is to combine a McKenna premixed flat flame burner with a water-
cooled substrate, forming a burner-stabilized premixed stagnation flame
configuration, as seen in Fig. 2(f.1). For example, Glumac and co-
workers [309] employed this burner geometry at low pressures to
synthesize loosely agglomerated nanopowders. Tse and co-workers
added electric field application to the set-up, synthesizing crystal-
line anatase, ultrafine TiO2 particles (with 5–6 nm diameters of
primary particles) by introducing titanium tetra-iso-propoxide (TTIP)
vapor into H2/O2/N2 mixture [355,356]. One disadvantage of this con-
figuration lies in that the decomposed metal precursor may
thermophoretically deposit in the small plug holes of the burner
head because the flame is stabilized at a close position that is only
~1.5 mm distance from the burner surface. The cleaning of
nanoparticles after each experimental run brings lots of inconve-
nience. Benefiting from the applications of stagnation flame
diamond-film synthesis, Wang and co-workers adopted a two-
concentric-tube coflow design, with inner tube of premixed fuel/
oxidizer/precursor mixture and outer tube of inert gas, to stabilize
the annular shear-layer at the edge of the flat flame [306,353,354]
impinging on a substrate, as seen in Fig. 2(f.3). With a high flow ve-
locity, they achieved a divergence-stabilized premixed stagnation flame.
The novel use of a rotating disk substrate shortens the growth span
of the particles, resulting in nanomaterials of greater tunability and
monodispersity [348]. Moreover, a few of the sub-tubes can be ar-
ranged in the burner nozzle to prevent flame blow off and extinction,
as shown in Fig. 2(f.2). Biswas and coworkers used a premixed
methane–oxygen burner made of a 3/8 O.D. stainless steel tube with
three 1/8 cylinders packed into the middle to achieve an optimal
outlet velocity (450 cm/s) through a 0.16 cm2 area [357,358]. Aiming
at the scale-up of premixed stagnation flames, Li and co-workers
employed a vane swirler (with swirl number <0.6), which is popular
in the combustion community, to develop a novel, turbulent, pre-
mixed stagnation swirl flame (SSF) for the synthesis of high purity,
ultrafine TiO2 nanoparticles [114,361]. As shown in Fig. 2(f.4), the
improved flame stabilization and increased radial turbulent mixing
from the swirl make the SSF a promising system for consistent and
homogeneous large-scale production. It can produce ultrafine non-
agglomerated nanoparticles of narrow size distribution, along with

uniform deposition coverage. As seen in Table 1, if the sizes of primary
particles are controlled to be less than 10 nm, the yields of TiO2
nanoparticles are about 0.15–0.60 g/MJ-fuel (i.e. 50–200 g/min·m2
with respect to burner nozzle area), exhibiting a scaling relation-
ship of Y ∝ dp
3 that is controlled by a coalescence (i.e. τcoll > τsint). As
a result, mono-disperse ultrafine nanospheres are produced, as par-
ticles coalesce before subsequent collision events occur [10]. If the
particle size further increases to 17 nm, a much larger TiO2 yield of
6.3 g/MJ-fuel can be achieved [306].

The renewed attention on the premixed stagnation flame in the
combustion community can be attributed to not only meeting the
need of controlling sizes or tailoring nanostructures with atomic
precision, but also to directly fabricating flame-made materials into
functional devices, as detailed in Section 4. More recently, Li and
co-workers proposed a new concept of one-step doping synthesis
of mixed-oxide nanomaterials by embedding the flame-assisted spray
pyrolysis process into the premixed stagnation flame configura-
tion [128]. Self-assembly, arising from the difference between the
chemical time scales of palladium acetate decomposition and TTIP
hydrolysis in the gas phase, generates ultrafine palladium particles
(<2.5 nm) well dispersed on high surface-area TiO2 particles (7–
8 nm). Indeed, even for the commonly liquid-fed flame spray pyrolysis
process, the application of a stagnation plate for nano-film fabri-
cation has gained attention, which will be introduced in Section 2.6.

2.6. Flame spray pyrolysis and precursor feeding spray techniques

As summarized above, flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) has been suc-
cessfully employed to synthesize nanomaterials comprising nearly
all metal elements of the periodic table, including oxides, salts, and
even pure metals. The laboratory-scale reactors have production rates
of a few grams per hour. The rapid development of FSP not only
meets the needs of exploring low-volatility and economical pre-
cursors, but also plays an important role in making functional
nanocomposites by flexible doping in precursor solutions. The cri-
teria for precursor selection are also summarized in the introduction
section of this paper. In view of several review papers on FSP tech-
nology [5,26,28] available, here, we only briefly focus on burner
techniques and scale-up studies of FSP.

In a typical FSP reactor, as displayed in Fig. 2(e) and in more detail
in Fig. 4(a), metallic precursors dissolved in a liquid fuel are deliv-
ered through the center capillary of a two-fluid nozzle (970/4-
S32; Schlick-Düsen); meanwhile, pure oxygen (or sometimes air)
is utilized as dispersion gas, atomizing the liquid precursor into fine
droplets with mass median diameters of several micrometers
[41,103,233,239,240]. The sprayed droplets of a precursor/fuel
mixture are ignited by six surrounding oxy-methane flamelets, which
serve as pilot flames for stabilizing combustion. The FSP burner is
centered in the cylindrical reactor chamber and surrounded by a
homogenized co-flow of ambient air that satisfies the entrain-
ment requirement of the spray flame and cools the aerosol before
powder collection with a bag-house filter. The fundamental studies
on combustion characteristics of isolated micron-sized precursor/
solvent droplets in FSP burner are experimentally investigated. In
contrast to pure solvent drops that burn uniformly and quasi-
steady, these precursor/solvent droplets in FSP can display disruptive
combustion behavior [363]. The mechanism of disruptive droplet
burning is similar to that of slurry droplets, consisting of three main
steps: (1) diffusion-controlled burning of the high-volatile solvent,
(2) viscous-shell formation due to decomposition of the low-
volatile metal precursor, and (3) subsequent disruption due to
heterogeneous nucleation. It was found that the concentration and
decomposition characteristics of the metal precursor are of signif-
icance in determining the time sequence of these three steps.

Scale-up studies of the FSP reactor have been successively done
by Mueller et al. [103,233] and Gröhn et al. [239,240]. Primarily,

Fig. 4. Techniques of various spraying atomizers used in flame spray pyrolysis. (a) Lab-scale two-phase atomizer, with liquid precursor delivered through the center cap-
illary and dispersed with oxygen, along with its location in a cylindrical reactor chamber [240]; (b) large-scale novel atomization combining a pressure swirl nozzle (liquid
hollow cone nozzle) and a dispersion gas nozzle, where α is the gas inclination angle, β is the gas swirl angle and γ is the for liquid hollow cone angle [362]; (c) lab-scale

Mädler et al. conducted a parameter study and examined the roles
of process parameters on the characteristics of product particles,
achieving SiO2 production rate of 9 g/h at a liquid HMDSO/ethanol
feed rate of 1 mL/min [41]. Pure oxygen as oxidant makes the drop-
lets burn much faster than that with air; thus, the product particles
experience longer residence times at higher temperatures, promot-
ing the formation of homogeneous and highly crystalline particles
by sintering. The specific surface area can be well controlled by
oxidant or fuel composition, flow rate, and precursor concentra-
tion. For scale-up, a larger spray angle and a broader flame were
found to allow higher production rates of nanoparticles with similar
particle sizes than that found in lab-scale reactors. Therefore, the
particular design of the swirler to enlarge the spray angle and
broaden the spray flame is considered for the atomizers, as shown
in Fig. 4(a). For example, in this design, as the feeding rate of
precursor/fuel mixture [Zr(C3H7O)4, 70 wt % in n-propanol that is
diluted in ethanol at a concentration of 0.5M] increases from 27.1
and 81.1 mL/min, under a fixed O2 dispersion gas flow rate of
50 L/min, the ZrO2 powder production rate increases from 100 to
300 g/h, meanwhile the product primary particle diameter increases
from 12 to 26 nm [233]. Gröhn et al. [240] further demonstrated
that the product primary particle size, agglomerate size, and crys-
tallinity can be conserved during the scale-up of FSP from ~100 to
500 g/h of zirconia, provided that the precursor and the disper-
sion flow rate are increased by the same factor (i.e. the gas-to-
liquid mass ratio are held constant). In addition, the yields of

nanoparticles by FSP, at about 4.0–24 g/MJ-fuel, are also very close
to those in other VAFS process, as seen in Table 1.

More recently, to meet the need for scalable and economical
manufacturing of nanomaterials by FSP, a novel atomization concept
was developed [362]. It is a combination of a liquid pressure swirl
nozzle (namely liquid hollow cone nozzle) and a swirl dispersion
gas nozzle (namely discrete jet nozzle). As seen in Fig. 4(b), a pres-
sure swirl nozzle is applied to create a liquid hollow cone that is
suitable for liquid precursor/fuel mixtures; and in the second step,
a different swirl dispersion gas nozzle is utilized to enhance the at-
omization of the liquid phase and to influence the spray cone
formation and geometry. In atomization, α and β represent the gas
inclination angle and gas swirl angle, respectively, for the swirl dis-
persion gas nozzle; meanwhile γ is the liquid hollow cone angle of
the pressure swirl nozzle. By using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) simulation, it was found that the gas swirl angle has a sig-
nificant influence on the axial gas velocity distribution, the direction
of the gas flow, and the stabilization of spraying. Based on the ex-
perimental data in terms of mass median droplet diameter, the
dispersion gas nozzle (number of holes/α/β) of 8/30°/15°, togeth-
er with the pressure swirl nozzle (γ = 70°), can result in small droplets
of 17.6 μm that is much closer to the droplet size of conventional
lab-scale flame spray pyrolysis-nozzles.

Electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) atomization, i.e. electrospray at-
omizer, which is capable of generating monodisperse aerosols with
much smaller droplets than any other spray methods, may possibly

meet the need of controlling sizes or dispersity with sufficient ac-
curacy [229,364–366]. Electrospray atomizer relies upon a strong
electric field to force the liquid column inside a capillary to form a
cone. The electric charges on the droplets result in repulsive forces
that delay cloud coalescence, which, combined with the Rayleigh
jet break-up into quasi-monodisperse droplets, enables the
atomizer to be attractive in nanomaterial synthesis [173,229,367].
More recently, Geier and Parker [229] employed an electrospray at-
omizer in flame synthesis of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
nanoparticles. Fig. 4(c) shows a schematic of such a spray config-
uration with nozzles pointed radially to the counter electrode in the
centerline and with a concentric ring extractor to minimize cross-
talk between neighboring sources, providing some shielding between
the individual jets before their break-up. This electrospray system
further uses a Hencken flat-flame burner, as described in detail in
Section 2.3, to create a vertically-directed hot gas flow for combus-
tion of the generated droplets [229]. Despite the controllably narrow
particle size distribution of nanoparticles by electrospray flame syn-
thesis, the small production rates limit the applicability of the process
for mass quantities.

In addition to the two-fluid (nozzle) and electrospray atomiz-
ers, ultrasonic atomizers are also commonly adopted in practice. The
setup for ultrasonic atomization is simple and highly-efficient, and
is also known as ultrasonic nebulization. With the driving force
coming from ultrasonic vibration, a narrow nozzle is no longer nec-
essary in the design to help break up the liquid and form the droplets.
Ultrasonic atomization is capable of atomizing an even wider range
of solutions, including slurry and suspensions. The droplet size of
the ultrasonic atomization can range from several to hundreds of
micrometers, depending on the ultrasonic energy (frequency), carrier
gas velocity, and liquid properties (like surface tension, density, and
viscosity). Early research usually yielded sub-micron particles from
flame synthesis via ultrasonic atomization; and these particles are
believed to be directly precipitated from single droplets [368]. Later,
with the combined consideration of droplet evaporation and pre-
cursor chemistry, nano-sized oxide particles were also obtained
through ultrasonic atomization, involving rapid solvent evapora-
tion at the first stage, followed by precursor decomposition in the
gas phase [48,132,208,222]. Granted the versatility and flexibility

of ultrasonic atomization, the production of a wide range of oxide
particles with controlled morphology can be realized, including
hollow particle, doughnut particle, encapsulated particle, and ‘hairy’
particle, as elaborated in the review paper by Nandiyanto and
Okuyama [369].

3. Progress on the synthesis of metal oxide nanocomposites

With a new need for producing functional nanocomposites, flame
aerosol synthesis, with its strong flexibility, can not only
precisely deposit a noble metal cluster onto a pristine oxide support
like TiO2 and Al2O3 with atomic accuracy [69,128], but can also
readily dope or fabricate mixed oxides or even their supported
noble metals to achieve a particular functional utilization
[51,65,177–181,370–375]. Several previous reviews have concen-
trated on the applications of mixed metal oxide catalysts [5,25,26,28].
Here, particularly from the viewpoint of the morphological struc-
tures of doped or fabricated nanocomposites, we briefly review the
progress on supported metal nanocatalysts, photocatalysts, sensing
nanomaterials, and nanophosphors, respectively. A doping diagram
summarizing flame aerosol synthesis of nanocomposites with desired
structures is presented thereafter at the end of this section.

3.1. Synthesis of supported metal nanocatalysts

Among the various kinds of flame-made catalysts, supported
metal nanocatalysts have attracted wide notice and are exten-
sively studied for special construction and excellent catalytic
activities. Supported noble metals are widely used as catalysts in
energy conversion processes, such as fine chemical synthesis, re-
fining of fuels, low-temperature combustion of hydrocarbons, and
treatment of exhaust gas. For these classes of catalysts, dispersion
of the precious metal (e.g., Pt, Pd, and Rh) on the oxide support is
especially critical because of the high expense of the metal. There-
fore, a specially supported structure of noble metal and oxide
support, as shown in Fig. 5(a–c), is needed for the design of cata-
lysts, where small active metal clusters are generally dispersed on
high surface area oxide supports such as TiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2, re-
spectively. The observed catalytic activities for such supported

impregnation methods. For example,

catalysts are significantly higher than those expected simply by
summing the contributions from the oxide supports and the pure
metals. This enhancement can be ascribed to the activity at the
special oxide–metal interface, coupled with the activities of the oxide
support and the noble metal. Flame-made catalysts have shown su-
perior catalytic performances compared to those prepared
for
by conventional
enantioselective hydrogenation by Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, the rate and
enantioselectivity of hydrogen pretreatment of the flame-made cata-
lysts at 500 °C were greatly improved, whereas the corresponding
wet-phase-derived catalysts showed only a comparatively weak
benefitcial effect [82] . The superior catalytic performances may be
attributed to two aspects: (i) the well-dispersed structures of metal–
support with ultra-high surface area (as high as 200 m2/g [128]) as
shown in Fig. 5, and (ii) the formation of special interfaces and strong
bindings (known as metal–support interaction) due to the atomic-
level fabrication of binary components under high temperature, often
considered as the reason for unique catalytic behaviors [83].

Moreover, factors affecting catalytic activities also include the
acidity of supports, precious metals, promoter, stabilizer or addi-
tive, etc. [74,83,94], which are beyond the scope of this review,
particularly considering several existing reviews on this topic [26,28].

3.1.1. TiO2 support

Strong metal–support interaction has been directly linked to the
presence of electronic defects that can be prepared with ease on
the surfaces of reducible oxides such as TiO2, as well as on other
kinds of transition metal oxides [376]. Basically, this strong metal–
support interaction is essential to sustaining high catalytic activity
under demanding catalyst operation conditions (i.e., high temper-
ature, high water vapor pressure, etc.). Anchoring the active metal
components to these electronic defects has been documented to have
strong interaction between the active metals and the defects of the
reducible oxides, fundamentally determining the dispersion, mor-
phology, and catalytic activity of metal clusters. For example, the
correlation between the number of oxygen defects on the TiO2
support and the dispersion and morphology of nanosized metal par-
ticles has been clearly demonstrated by density functional theory
(DFT) calculations [377].

Innovative FASP design of a highly-quenched premixed
stagnation-point swirl flame (SSF) system based on atomic-level as-
sembly (via controlling time scales of reaction, nucleation, and
coagulation of different metal oxides) was used to synthesize well-
dispersed palladium clusters on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles
with diameters less than 10 nm [128]. As shown in Fig. 5(a), through
spray flame synthesis, the ultrafine palladium particles (<2.5 nm)
are well dispersed on the high surface-area TiO2 nanoparticles (7–
8 nm). These flame-made nanocatalysts have shown superior
catalytic performance compared to that of those nanocatalysts pre-
pared by conventional impregnation methods. The apparent
activation energy of the FSP-deposited Au/TiO2 catalyst is similar

to the values reported in the literature for oxidation of CO over sup-
ported gold catalysts; however, the surface area is more than twice
of that usually obtained in spray flame using quench cooling and
filter-collected particles [138]. In addition, for flame-made Pt—Co/
TiO2 catalysts, the addition of Co led to a higher amount of Pt terrace
atoms being formed on the catalyst surface, which promoted the
selectivity toward ethylnitrobenzene. The positive effect of Co ad-
dition can be observed when the catalysts were reduced at 500 °C.
Both hydrogenation activity and selectivity of vinylaniline over
Pt—Co/TiO2 were drastically increased and surpassed those of mono-
metallic Pt/TiO2 because of the strong interaction between Pt—Co
and the migration of TiOx species [139].

3.1.2. Al2O3 support

The most frequently used support for noble metals is inert Al2O3,
such as γ-Al2O3. Different from reducible oxides (e.g., TiO2 men-
tioned above and CeO2 to be discussed later), electronic defects are
not present on γ-Al2O3. However, it seems that the coordinately un-
saturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+
penta) centers present on the (100)
facets of γ-Al2O3 surfaces can effectively anchor noble metal
clusters [378]. Noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd) on Al2O3 were made and
tested in the catalytic partial oxidation of methane. The ignition of
the reaction toward carbon monoxide and hydrogen depended on
the noble metal constituents and their loading. The selectivity of
these noble metal catalysts toward CO and H2 was similar under the
conditions examined (methane:oxygen ratio 2:1, temperature from
300 to 500 °C), exceeding significantly those of gold and silver con-
taining catalysts [69]. Rh/Al2O3 was found to show an enhanced and
stable activity in the partial oxidation of methane [80]. The Al2O3
support inhibits Rh oxidation, maintaining Rh in its metallic state,
which is preferable for high syngas formation. In addition, as men-
tioned above, flame-made Pd/Al2O3 catalysts exhibited superior
catalytic performance for enantioselective hydrogenation com-
pared to that for corresponding wet-phase-derived catalysts [83].
Again, these enhanced catalytic performances can be attributed to
the special interface and binding resulting from the atomic-level
precision of assembly for binary metal-oxide systems by FSP or other
kinds of spary flame synthesis techniques [83].

It should be noted that bimetallic or trimetallic supported cata-
lysts have been also prepared by FSP as seen in Fig. 6(b), showing
better performance than single metal supported ones. Flame-
made Pt—Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with large pores exhibited better catalytic
activity and stability than the ones made by impregnation in the
dehydrogenation of propane, without altering the selectivity to pro-
pylene [84]. The presence of large pores in the flame-made catalysts
not only facilitated diffusion of the reactants and products but also
lessened the amount of carbon deposited during reactions. Bime-
tallic Pd—Pt nanoparticles supported on alumina were also prepared
by the FSP method [70]. The noble metal components of the ma-
terials were predominantly in the oxidized state and well dispersed
in the alumina matrix. Small bimetallic Pd—Pt alloy particles (<5 nm)

15

supported on Al2O3 ceramic nanoparticles are then produced after
reduction. The addition of small amounts of platinum made the pal-
ladium particles more resistant against sintering at high temperatures
and further lowered deactivation during low-temperature methane
combustion. The catalytic properties of the flame-made trimetallic
nanocrystalline Pt—Sn—X/Al2O3 (X = Ce, Zn, and K) catalysts were
investigated in the dehydration of propane [379]. It was found that
the addition of Ce during FSP synthesis resulted in higher Pt dis-
persion as well as improved catalytic activity and stability than that
for the non-promoted Pt—Sn/Al2O3. The mechanism for forming the
trimetallic nanoparticles during one-step flame synthesis seemed
to be strongly dependent on the difference between the vapor pres-
sures of the metals and the alumina support.

In addition, mixed-oxide supports are also of great interest. For
example, FSP-made SiO2/Al2O3 mixed support can generate extra
pseudo-bridging bonds, enhancing their Brøsted acidity to strengths
that are similar or even higher than those encountered in conven-
tional zeolites [83]. The molar ratio of strong and weak acid sites
can be easily adjusted for desired reactions by varying the alumi-
num content. Then, palladium nanoparticles dispersed on silica-
alumina (Pd/SA) with tunable surface acidity, with supported
structure shown in Fig. 5(c), were prepared by one-step FSP [74].
Quantitative solid-state NMR spectroscopy of the catalysts with dif-
ferent Si/Al ratios revealed that the concentration of Brøsted acid
sites in these catalysts increases with increasing aluminum content
up to 70 at%. The support acidity directly influenced the electron-
ic properties of the Pd nanoparticles as proven by DRIFT spectroscopy
with CO as probe molecule. Pd/SA with 15 at% aluminum (Pd/SA-15)
exhibited excellent chemoselectivity for C=O bond hydrogena-
tion of acetophenone. Further enhancement of the support acidity
as achieved in Pd/SA-30 and Pd/SA-70 further increased the reac-
tion rate and promoted the competing hydrogenation of the aromatic
ring [74]. The tunable acid properties of SiO2/Al2O3 may promote
its application as a solid acid and as an acidic support in the chem-
ical industry.

3.1.3. Perovskites (ABO3) support

These flame-made mixed-oxide catalysts (or supports) also
include perovskites and spinels. Perovskites are a kind of mixed
oxides with general formula ABO3, where, in catalytic applica-
tions, A usually represents a lanthanide ion and B a transition metal
ion. Both A and B can be partially substituted by other elements.
Perovskites with high thermal stability are attractive for high tem-
perature processes, such as catalytic combustion of natural gas in
turbines for electricity generation.

La-based perovskites (such as LaCoO3, LaMnO3, and LaFeO3) have
drawn particular interest because their catalytic properties can be
easily tuned by substituting a small fraction of A-site atoms with
other cations such as Ba, Ce, or Sr [380]. Perovskitic LaCoO3 mixed-
metal oxides have been prepared in nanoparticle-size powder form,
and the results showed that the higher the initial sintering of cat-
alyst particles within the flame, the higher the thermal stability [177].
A set of perovskite-type catalysts of general formula LaBO3±δ (B = Co,
Mn, Fe) have been prepared by flame hydrolysis. These catalysts were
characterized as nanometer-size particles (20–60 nm), with rela-
tively high surface area (ca. 20 m2/g), high thermal stability, and high
phase purity, demonstrating high activity for catalytic flameless com-
bustion of methane [381].

There are further modifications of the LaBO3±δ (B = Co, Mn, Fe) to
improve the performances. Perovskite-type La1−xCexMnO3(x = 0–10%)
catalysts were prepared by FSP. The introduction of Ce4+ resulted in
modification of the chemical states of both B-site ions and oxygen
species and also facilitated the reducibility of the perovskite [161].
The perovskite La1−xCexMnO3 with x equal to 0.1 exhibited the highest
activity, with a structure shown in Fig. 5(d) [160]. Perovskite-type
catalysts of general formula ABO3±δ (A = La, Y; B = Mn, Fe) containing

2 wt% Pd were produced by FSP. Among the investigated perovskite-
type oxides, YFeO3±δ exhibits the best performance for methane
oxidation under stoichiometric conditions in the presence of Pd, likely
because of the high accessibility of Pd exposed at its surface [160].
La1−xMxCoO3±δ with M = Ce, Eu and x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 were inves-
tigated. All samples were nanostructured, thermally very stable, and
characterized by highly-crystalline perovskite-like structure and high
surface area. The higher activity of Ce-doped catalysts as compared
to those doped with Eu was found to be related to the strength of
the bonds between oxygen and Co ions [186].

3.1.4. Spinel (AB2O4) support

Spinel-type oxides are compounds with the general chemical
formula AB2O4. Basically, the A ion is tetrahedrally coordinated, and
the B ion is octahedrally coordinated, with inverse spinel struc-
tures possible as well, where B ions, partially or fully, occupy
tetrahedral positions and A ions reside in the octahedral sites. Many
elements can be accommodated in spinel or spinel-like struc-
tures, allowing for a wide array of possible spinel formulations. Thus,
there exists a correspondingly large flexibility for tailoring these
oxides for specific applications, such as catalysts and sensors (as de-
scribed in the later section). Flame-made AB2O4 has exhibited
homogeneous single-crystal structure.

FSP of a Pd-based combustion catalyst was demonstrated, where
homogenous spinel crystal MgAl2O4 acted as support [62]. During
the heating and cooling cycles of methane conversion, both
Pd—MgAl2O4 and Pd—Al2O3 retain much of their surface area,
whereas TiO2 and CeO2 supports strongly sintered with large loss
of surface area.

Spinel-like oxides with the general formula MgAl2−xMxO4 (M = Mn,
Fe, Co) were synthesized in a one-step FSP. These oxides showed
improved resistance to sintering upon increased alumina content.
XPS data revealed the surface enrichment of the transition metal
constituent, which favorably increased the fraction of transition metal
exposed to the environment. By tuning the fraction of transition
metal in the mixed oxides, nanocomposite materials were ob-
tained with a good balance between thermal stability and activity
in the catalytic combustion of methane. The activity of the mate-
rials increased in the order: Fe < Co < Mn [63].

3.1.5. ZrO2, CeO2, and ZrO2—CeO2 supports

In addition to TiO2 and Al2O3, which are the most widely used
supports, there are also ZrO2, CeO2, along with their mixed oxide
(i.e. ZrO2—CeO2). Flame-derived bimetallic Pt—Pd/ZrO2 catalysts were
reported to exhibit excellent catalytic performances in solvent-
free hydrogenation of alicyclic and aromatic ketones, such as
cyclopentanone and acetophenone [76]. The Pt—Pd catalysts have
a high dispersion of Pt and Pd, and their metal loading can be easily
controlled on the ZrO2 surface. More importantly, the catalysts can
be reused without significant loss in activity and selectivity after
appropriate treatment. The catalytic activities of the FSP-made Co/
ZrO2 catalysts for CO hydrogenation were much higher than those
compared to Co/ZrO2 prepared by the conventional impregnation
method [187]. Moreover, the hydrogenation rates of the FSP-
made Co/ZrO2 catalysts increased with increasing Co loading and
precursor feed rate. The improvement of catalytic activity and C2—C6
selectivities of the flame-made catalysts was attributed to the higher
number of Co metal active sites and lower interaction between Co/
CoO and ZrO2 support. For flame-made V/ZrO2 [77], low temperature
NO catalytic reduction activity would indicate that an optimal
dispersion of monomeric VOx species on zirconia is attained with
15% V in the V/ZrO2 catalyst. Mixed oxides of 4% Cu/CexZr1−xO2 (x = 0,
0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1) were assessed for the equimolar reduction of NO
by CO (3000 ppm each, space velocity 50,000 h−1) [194]. It was dem-
onstrated that incorporation of Zr4+ in the form of solid solution with

16

CeO2 stabilizes the Cu+ species, which was in turn beneficial for the
initial reductive chemisorption of NO to N2O.

NOx storage-reduction (NSR) catalysis is the most promising
concept for reducing NOx under lean conditions. Pt/Ba catalysts for
NOx storage-reduction (NSR) supported on ceria/zirconia were pre-
pared by two-nozzle FSP [237]. The as-prepared material consisted
of intimately mixed agglomerates of BaCO3 and CexZr1−xO2 par-
ticles, as shown in Fig. 5(e). The low thermal stability of BaCO3
resulted in high NOx storage capacity, whereas the support com-
position (CexZr1−xO2) strongly affected the NOx reduction activity of
Pt. Generally, the flame-made Pt/Ba/ceria-zirconia NSR catalysts are
efficient for NOx storage; however, further investigations in the pres-
ence of real exhaust gases also containing CO2, H2O, and SO2 are
needed to fully assess the potential of flame-made Pt/Ba/ceria-
zirconia for NOx storage.

3.1.6. Noble-metal-free oxide catalysts with core-shell structures

Nano- CexZr1−xO2 and Al2O3—CexZr1−xO2 materials made by FSP are
not only excellent supports for noble metals, but also themselves
offer surprisingly superior activities for both NOx reduction and hy-
drocarbon oxidation in high-throughput screening studies, as well
as continuous flow catalytic studies [85]. The flame-made CeOx/
Al2O3 and ZrO2/Al2O3 nanocomposites usually exhibit a complex core-
shell structure where the alumina coats crystals of ceria or zirconia
or their solid solutions CexZr1−xO2, as shown in Fig. 6(a), with formula
(Ce0.7Zr0.3O2)0.5/(Al2O3)0.5. These oxide catalysts offer activities com-
parable to that of traditional Pt/Al2O3 catalysts but without the
addition of Pt. Thus, they are Pt-free, yet still active for extremely
important emission control reactions, especially considering that
they are only first-generation raw materials. At higher CeO2 con-
tents, core-shell particles are observed with CeO2 cores, but the shells
contain considerable amounts of Ce3+ species, probably as CeAl11O18.
It is possible therefore to envision that, at low Al2O3 contents, the
resulting shells contain considerable quantities of Ce3+ and possi-
bly Zr3+, which may contribute to the favorable activity.

How does one make a complex core-shell structure? For one,
temperature has been experimentally demonstrated to be a good
controlling parameter by Wang and co-workers [12]. CeO2
nanospheres doped with varied amounts of titanium were synthe-
sized through FSP of a solution made by dissolving cerium carbonate
into propionic acid with stoichiometric amounts of TTIP. The syn-
thetic strategy of generating the nanoparticles by flame at about
2500 °C facilitates the crystallization of the CeO2 (melting point
2400 °C), while maintaining the TiO2 (melting point 1843 °C) in a
molten state. Therefore, the (molten) titanium oxide shell encap-
sulates the inner ceria core and accommodates a spherical
morphology, as shown in Fig. 6(b). This complex core-shell struc-
ture can minimize the surface energy of mixed-oxide nanoparticles,
which become more perfectly spherical with increasing shell TiO2
content. Apart from catalyst applications, this core-shell structure
also shows great potential for utilization as high-quality, high-
precision microelectronics and nanoelectronics over large-size
wafers. Such fabrication of functional devices is elaborated upon
in Section 4.

3.2. Synthesis of doped photocatalysts

One way to improve the performance of semiconductor
nanomaterials (i.e. TiO2) is to increase their optical activity by shift-
ing the onset of the response from the UV to the visible region. This
shift can be accomplished by narrowing the band gap by doping
with other elements, thus altering the optoelectronic properties [3].
To obtain the reduced band-gap energy, in contrast to the afore-
mentioned separately supported structures, the dopants need to be
homogeneously distributed in a crystalline parent semiconductor
matrix without giving rise to a new crystallographic phase, as shown

Fig. 7. Flame-made nanocomposite materials with homogenously-mixed single-
phase structures. (a) Low-resolution and high resolution TEM images of single particles,
with magnified portion of the particles and respective SAED patterns of pure
TiO2 (upper panel), 4 atom % Fe-doped TiO2 (middle panel), and 10 atom % Fe-
doped TiO2 (lower panel); (b) energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) of 10 atom % Fe-doped
TiO2 nanoparticles. (Reprinted with permission from literature by George et al. [121].)

in Fig. 7(a) [121]. Additionally, coupling collective oscillations of elec-
trons in the conduction band of the doped metal nanoparticle
surfaces to those in the conduction band of the support materials
in the metal–support nanocomposites can improve the perfor-
mance. The combination of semiconductor support and doped metal
cluster has been reported to enhance photocatalytic activity by trap-
ping the photo-induced charge carriers, thereby improving the charge
transfer processes.

3.2.1. TiO2-based photocatalysts

As the most promising photocatalyst, TiO2 materials are ex-
pected to play an important role in addressing many environmental
and energy challenges. Since the late 1970s, a large body of re-
search has discovered that TiO2 exhibits excellent catalytic properties
for various reactions, and has also been used as support to dope
various noble and transition metals for distinct catalytic applica-
tions. More importantly, nanophase TiO2, which has a large surface
area that can facilitate a fast rate of surface reactions, is a widely
used wide-bandgap semiconductor photocatalyst for a variety of
solar-driven clean energy and environmental technologies [382].
However, the band gap of bulk TiO2 lies in the UV regime (3.0 eV
for the rutile phase and 3.2 eV for the anatase phase), partially re-
stricting its application at low energy wavelengths, covering only
a small fraction of the sun’s energy (<10%). Many methods have been
reported to improve the photocatalytic activity of pure titania. Here
four aspects of them that are used in flame aerosol synthesis

S.Q. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 1–59

17

are listed together with the corresponding change of physicochemi-
cal properties of nanocatalysts.

In the first aspect, doping TiO2 with various transition metals
during high-temperature flame synthesis can efficiently create im-
purity energy levels with the valence and conduction bands of TiO2,
and, therefore, facilitate the activation of TiO2 toward visible light
[121]. As displayed in Fig. 7(a), TEM images show indistinguish-
able crystalline morphology of pure and Fe-doped TiO2 particles
in a range of 9–20 nm, while the highly crystalline nature of these
particles is evident from the distinct SAED crystallographic rings
(Fig. 7(a), right column) and HRTEM images (lattice fringes of 0.355,
0.343, and 0.324 nm spacing with respect to anatase, 4% Fe-doped
TiO2, and rutile). Then, as shown in Fig. 7(b), the energy-filtered
TEM (EFTEM) clearly displays the homogeneous distribution of Fe
in the parent TiO2 matrix, which plays an important role in con-
trolling the photoactivity of the doped nanocomposite. The
homogenous distribution of the Fe3+-edge confirms the presence
of vacant 3d-orbitals for trapping electrons during excitations.
Therefore, the transition Fe lowers the band gap energy by intro-
ducing trap levels between the valance and conduction bands of
TiO2.

The rate of oxalic acid mineralization by Fe/TiO2 (Fe/Ti = 0.05)
has been observed to be 6.4 times higher than that for similarly pre-
pared bare TiO2 and Degussa P25 [120]. V-doped TiO2 showed that
V doping enhances the photocatalytic activity under both UV and
visible light irradiation [152]. More recently, a series of semicon-
ductor photocatalysts based on transition metals (M′ = V, Cr, Fe, Co,
Mn, Mo, Ni, Cu, Y, Ce, and Zr) incorporated into TiO2 (Ti/M′ = 20
atomic ratio) materials have been synthesized by adopting a one-
step FSP technique [119]. H2-TPR studies revealed the formation of
Me—Ti bonds, suggesting the strong interaction of dopant metal–
TiO2 in all the as-synthesized materials. The reduction peaks in Cr-
doped TiO2 shifted to much lower temperatures because of the
increase in the reduction potential of titania and chromium. The ex-
istence of Ti3+ species with narrow band gap is highly beneficial to
visible light-induced photocatalytic activity. The electrons migrate
from the TiO2 nanoparticles to the chromium species, revealing a
strong interaction between Cr and TiO2 nanostructure at the inter-
face of the flame-made nanoparticles. Conversely, Mn3+ species
combined with TiO2 because the surface metal dispersion was kept
high after TiO2 loading. However, the Mn3+ incorporated catalyst was
inactive because of the small energy driving force for electrons to
detrap from Mn2+. Among all of the catalysts tested, the transition
metal (M′ = Cr, Fe, and V) incorporated materials showed the most
impressive catalytic performance in visible light. Cr-doped titania
demonstrated superior catalytic performance, with the rate con-
stant about 8–19 times higher than the rest of the metal doped
catalysts.

In the second aspect, depositing noble metals on the surface of
TiO2 (i.e. surface doping) can efficiently trap the excited state elec-
trons and help efficient charge separation [383]. Teoh et al. [115]
reported that Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts favor a reductive pathway which
is different and faster than the pathway followed when using Degussa
P25 TiO2. Hydrogen evolution increases by one order of magni-
tude in water photo-splitting and by 30 times in methanol
photoreforming upon 1% gold addition on TiO2 [140]. Tiwari et al.
[141] used a one-step flame aerosol reactor to synthesize 2–4 nm
noble metal clusters dispersed on 30–40 nm titanium dioxide
nanocomposites (Pt/TiO2, Pd/TiO2, and bimetallic Pt—Pd/TiO2). On
incorporation of the noble metal, the formation of the rutile phase
of titanium dioxide was suppressed. Platinum particles dispersed
on the TiO2 surface enhanced the photocatalytic activity compared
to pristine TiO2. Optimum platinum loading for the highest photo-
catalytic activity was approximately 0.5–1.0% Pt. Bimetallic noble
metal catalysts (Pt—Pd/TiO2) showed enhanced photocatalytic ac-
tivity compared to pristine titanium dioxide.

In the third aspect, doping anion rather than metal ion can also
narrow the band gap of TiO2. F-doped TiO2 exhibited the highest
photocatalytic activity for the complete oxidation of acetaldehyde
(ACE), surpassing that of benchmark Aeroxide TiO2 (P25), bare TiO2,
and Cu-doped TiO2 [142]. The lower proportion of native terminal
hydroxyl groups, as evaluated using high-field 1H MAS NMR, on
the particle surface of F-doped TiO2 possibly leads to a high
photocatalystic performance.

Finally, in addition to doping with the metal ion or anion, TiO2
nanoparticles coupling with another semiconductor can not only
improve the efficient charge separation by trapping the other semi-
conductor, but also result in good adsorption ability of pollutants.
A combination of WO3 and TiO2, with bandgaps of 2.8 eV and 3.2
eV respectively, allows the transfer of photogenerated electrons from
TiO2 to WO3, which facilitates the effective charge separation. At the
same time, the formation of a monolayer of WOx on TiO2 can in-
crease the surface acidity and thus adsorb more hydroxyl groups
and organic reactants on its surface. Akurati et al. [134] used FSP
to obtain amorphous WOx species on the surface W-doped TiO2 sub-
strate particles at the conditions of <3.6 mol% WO3 concentration
and high oxygen-to-fuel ratio. The formed amorphous layer en-
hances the acidity of the particles and then improves their
photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue sig-
nificantly compared to that of pure TiO2.

3.2.2. ZnO-based photocatalysts

ZnO, a wide-band gap semiconductor (with gap energy of about
3.30 eV at room temperature), is of growing significance in photo-
catalyst substrate materials. In contrast to undoped ZnO, Au/ZnO
has shown a stronger absorption of visible light and a lower inten-
sity of photoluminescence (PL) emission. Recombination of the
photo-induced electron–hole pairs may be retarded due to the pres-
ence of discrete Au clusters by the shift in Fermi level and the stored
photo-generated electrons in them. Height et al. reported synthe-
sis of high surface area Ag—ZnO catalysts by FSP [200]. Silver metal
clusters that discretely deposited on ZnO nanocrystals is believed
to retard recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.
The Ag loading (1–5 at. %) controlled the Ag cluster size from 5 to
25 nm but influenced little the ZnO crystal size. The rate of
photodegradation was optimal at an Ag loading of 1–3 at. % because
high loadings can decrease available particle surface for reactant ad-
sorption and light absorption. The best photocatalytic performance
was exhibited for the longest high-temperature residence times, as
characterized by high crystallinity (XRD and UV–vis) compared with
that for wet-made Ag—ZnO and reference TiO2 photocatalysts.
Au—ZnO and Pt—ZnO nanocomposites have been synthesized by
one-step FSP [201]. Although both flame-derived Au—ZnO and
Pt—ZnO possess similar physical properties (i.e., crystallite size and
specific surface area), an improvement in photocatalytic degrada-
tion of methylene blue with respect to pure ZnO and commercial
titania photocatalysts (JRC-TiO2 and P-25) was observed for Au—ZnO,
but not for Pt—ZnO, probably because of the different types of Fermi-
level equilibration between Au and Pt.

Before ending this section, we discuss the dopant-induced
changes of physico-chemical properties of TiO2- and ZnO-based
photocatalysts. It is widely recognized that photocatalytic activi-
ties strongly depend on many factors, i.e. surface acidity, crystallinity,
structure and so on [134,383,384]. In general, flame aerosol syn-
thesis can produce a series of new photocatalysts with closely
controlled morphology and composition (i.e. photocatalysts with
various dopants, mixed metal oxide photocatalysts) because of a
much wider choice of metal precursors. At the same time, this kind
of rapid and high temperature continuous synthesis can yield
photocatalysts exhibiting high intrinsic activity. However, the shorter
residence time of flame aerosol synthesis results in many surface
defects that have the detrimental effect of charge recombination,

overwhelming the benefits of surface energetics. Therefore, how to
design flame-made photocatalysts to overcome the inherent charge
trap defects and recombination centers and to explore potential ef-
ficient photocatalysts still remain significant challenges.

3.3. Synthesis of nanophosphor materials

More recently, nanophosphor materials have attracted substan-
tial consideration in display fields because of their improved
properties such as high luminescent efficiency, quantum effect, and
higher doping concentration without concentration quenching. As
such, they have potential applications in biolabeling, biosensors, and
multiphoton confocal microscopy, along with promising usage as
“invisible” infrared materials. Flame synthesis has been demon-
strated to be a single-step, continuous, and high-rate synthesis
method for non-agglomerated upconversion nanophosphors
[79,86,99,102,104,134,217–227,383–385]. The heat released from the
combustion of a gaseous or liquid fuel and the precursor itself can
provide the high-temperature environment, which is favorable to
phosphor synthesis. Moreover, flame temperature, particle resi-
dence time, and particle size determine the characteristics of the
phosphor materials (i.e. enhanced display luminescence and
resolution).

Rare-earth (RE) doped upconversion nanophosphors, possess-
ing sharp luminescence in the visible range with near-infrared
excitation, is of great interest [79,102,217–227]. For example,
europium-doped yttrium oxide (Y2O3:Eu3+) is a remarkable red phos-
phor, which has been widely used in optical displays and lighting
applications. Under ultraviolet (UV) excitation, Y2O3:Eu3+ gives a sharp
red emission line at 611 nm, and the luminescence efficiency is high
because its charge transfer transition is located in the UV range. Na-
noscale Y2O3:Eu3+ phosphor showed significant promise in high-
resolution displays (field emission display, flat panel display, thin
film electroluminescence panel, etc.) because the quantum effi-
ciency of doped nanocrystals increases as the particle size decreases
[221]. Y2O3:Eu3+ also showed the nanophosphor peak in the red
region of the visible spectrum with a maximum peak at a wave-
length of 609 nm when excited with 398 nm photons. The cubic
nanoparticles exhibited longer decay times but lower maximum pho-
toluminescence intensity than did commercial micron-sized bulk
Y2O3:Eu3+ phosphor powder [219]. As far as the structures of
nanophosphor materials are concerned, it greatly depends on their
sizes. Dosev et al. reported flame-made nanoparticles that were sepa-
rated by centrifugation into two size groups, a smaller one of
5–60 nm and a large one of 50–200 nm. The fluorescence spectra,
the electron diffraction pattern, and the XRD pattern of the large
group particles were typical of the stable cubic (Mn2O3 type) phase
of bulk Y2O3, whereas those of the small group particles were quite
different and indicated the possible presence of higher density meta-
stable mixed phases including monoclinic, with some indication of
a face-centered cubic phase [218].

Interestingly, it is noted that Y2O3:Eu3+ or SiO2:Y2O3:Eu3+phosphor
particles can be enhanced much more by forming a complex core-
shell structure, i.e., phosphorous core and silica shell [102]. First, the
silica shell could reduce the reflectance of exciting radiation com-
pared to that for pure phosphor particles. Second, the silica shell
can stabilize the surface of the particles that leads to the lumines-
cence enhancement of the core phosphor. Third, formation of the
core shell structure provides additional properties such as
hydrophilization and detoxification for the phosphor core. The
Y2Si2O7:Eu/SiO2 core-shell phosphor particles, as shown in Fig. 6(c),
were successfully synthesized by one-step FSP using a precursor
aerosol containing yttrium nitrate, europium nitrate, and colloidal
silica nano-particles [102]. Similar to the strategy of making core-
shell structures in Section 3.1.6, high flame temperature enabled the
formation of the core-shell structure, whereas the low temperature

did not. In addition, high silicon concentration in the precursor so-
lution led to the desired ideal spherical core-shell structure shown
in Fig. 6(c), instead of non-spherical core-shell structures. Under ul-
traviolet excitation, the ideal spherical core-shell particles emitted
the best photoluminescence.

There have been many attempts for flame synthesis of other kinds
of rare-earth doped nanophosphors. Cerium-doped Y3Al5O12
(YAG:Ce3+) particles, as yellow emission phosphor, are another re-
markable phosphor in the solid-state lighting field, since it can be
used to generate white light by mixing with blue light emitting
diodes. The optimum cerium-doping concentration of YAG:Ce
nanoparticles is 4.0 at.%, achieving a quantum efficiency of 45.0%
[86]. The efficient emission of YAG:Ce nanoparticles also origi-
nates from a relatively good distribution of Ce ions incorporated into
the host material of YAG, as evidenced from elemental mapping anal-
ysis. A more complex rare-earth doping method in flame synthesis
is needed to obtain the desired blue, green, and red emissions, re-
spectively [134]. For example, Y2O3:(4%Yb + 1%Tm) nanocrystals
exhibit blue emissions between 450 and 500 nm, in which the stron-
gest luminescence peak at 477 nm is consistent with the 1G4→3H6
transition of Tm3+ that requires three-step energy transfer from Yb3+
ions. The Y2O3:(4%Yb + 1%Ho) nanocrystals have green emissions near
543 nm and red emissions near 665 nm, which are identified as
transitions of (5S2, 5F4)→5I8 and 5F5→5I8 of Ho3+, respectively.
Y2O3:(8%Yb + 6%Er) nanophosphors have strong red emission peaks
at 657, 663, and 673 nm, which are attributed to the 4F9/2→4I15/2 tran-
sition of Er3+. Besides the above yttria-based nanophosphors, Mn-
doped zinc silicate is widely used as a green phosphor in plasma
display panels and cathode ray tubes because of its chemical sta-
bility, high luminescence efficiency, and semiconducting properties.
The luminescence properties of flame-made Zn2SiO4:Mn2+ par-
ticles were found to improve at higher methane flow rates during
pyrolysis and at higher annealing temperatures [92].

3.4. Doping diagram for nanocomposite synthesis

To obtain the designed structures of nanocomposites, i.e., sup-
ported, core-shell, or homogeneously-uniform ones, as mentioned
above, a doping diagram for various nanocomposite syntheses is pre-
sented here to meet the different functional utilizations of flame-
made materials. In fact, the attempt for drawing such a diagram can
be traced back to the early work of Ehrman et al. in 1998 [292].

Here, three determining factors are summarized, including pre-
cursor reaction type, material miscibility, and feasible burner design,
abbreviated as “RMB”. Five important nanocomposite structures are
then categorized according to the “RMB” design criteria, as illus-
trated in Fig. 8. The ordinate represents the miscibility degree of
binary metal oxide components, whereas the abscissa indicates their
doping status, i.e., inter-particle or intra-particle doping. The intra-
particle doping, where atom diffusion plays a key role, is easily
enhanced by some special conditions of higher temperature, smaller
sizes of coalesced particles of multi-components, etc., and vice versa
for inter-particle doping. From left to right, the supported struc-
ture of nanocomposites to produce metal-support catalysts is
displayed, as described in Section 3.1. A recent example of the sup-
ported structure can be found in the work of Li and co-workers [137].
In this work, the titania supported palladium nano-catalysts (Pd/
TiO2) were synthesized in a FASP process subject to the stagnation-
flow configuration, in which the palladium clusters are well dispersed
on TiO2 support. Supported structure is usually favored in a low tem-
perature synthesis environment (short residence time and high
quenching rate) to hinder the severe sintering and intra-particle
doping of oxide components. In terms of the precursor reaction and
burner design, two possible synthesis routes are available. When
the reactions of the precursors are temperature driven, the syn-
thesis process is insensitive to the burner type as long as the two

components have large difference in characteristic reaction time,
nucleating and growing in sequence, which results in a pattern of
inter-particle doping. When the precursors are sensitive to both tem-
perature and radicals, i.e., one component is temperature driven and
the other component is radical driven, the premixed flame burner
is advantageous, as it can provide abundant radicals (like OH) at the
early flame stage to initiate fast decomposition of the radically driven
component. For miscibility, recent research claims that the misci-
bility at the nano-scale is not absolute and may be different than
that for bulk materials. Complex metal–support interactions are
found to exist between the components [128].

The segregated structure of the nanocomposites is composed of
separate particles of each component mixed together. Two possi-
ble synthesis routes are shown in the diagram in Fig. 8. If the
decomposition of both components are temperature driven, either
type of burner can be used. If the decomposition is driven by radi-
cals, the premixed flame burner is preferred to promote inter-
particle doping. Notably, the segregated structure can also be
conveniently obtained by employing two nozzle flames together for
ensuring inter-particle doping, which can be found in the work of
Strobel et al. [26], for the case of BaCO3/Al2O3 particles.

Similar to the supported structure, the core-shell structure shares
the similar synthesis routes, but with a significant difference in the
high temperature condition. The typical examples are those men-
tioned earlier by Feng et al. [12] (Section 3.1.6) and Hasegawa et al.
[102]. In the former, the high 2500 °C flame temperature causes the
(molten) TiO2 shell to encapsulate the inner CeO2 core, accommo-
dating a spherical morphology as shown in Fig. 6(b). In the latter,
the Y2Si2O7:Eu core and the SiO2 shell structure are favored by a
higher flame temperature up to 3052 K, in which the formation of
a perfectly spherical core-shell structure requires a high concen-
tration of SiO2 in the precursor.

In terms of intra-particle doping, there are another two impor-
tant structures of nanocomposites, i.e., the Janus particle and the
uniform particle. The Janus particle is a spherical particle consist-
ing of two distinct parts with different chemical compositions that
can hold both the chemical and physical properties of two phases,
for example, Fe2O3/SiO2 as reported in the literature by Zhao and

Gao [104]. The uniform particle, on the contrary, is a spherical
particle that consists of uniform multi-components (like the
aforementioned perovskites, spinel, CexZr1−xO2, transition-metal
doped TiO2, etc.). As shown in the diagram, the homogeneously-
uniform particles can be synthesized in two typical routes. For the
case when the decompositions of both components are tempera-
ture driven, either type of burner can be used as long as the flame
temperature is sufficiently high for particles to coagulate and co-
alesce into a single sphere under fast quenching. When the radically-
driven decomposition reactions are involved in the synthesis, as
mentioned above, the premixed flame burner is advantageous over
the diffusion flame burner for a high radical concentration to fa-
cilitate the reactions. Janus particle synthesis is rarely reported in
flame aerosol synthesis. The work reported in the literature by Zhao
and Gao [104] adopted ferric triacetylacetonate (pyrolysis) and
tetraethylorthosilicate (hydrolysis) as precursors, and the iron and
silicon components formed an intermixed solid, which then un-
derwent phase separation in the flame.

4. Flame aerosol synthesis of carbon–metal
oxide nanocomposites

More recently, to meet the ever-increasing demand for renew-
able energy resources and, in particular energy storage devices,
carbon–metal oxide (CMO) nanocomposites have received consid-
erable attention in various kinds of applications, such as
supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries, since they not only combine
the properties of carbon nanomaterials and nanostructured metal
oxides but also hold new extraordinary properties caused by the
interactions between them [386–388]. Because of their low cost and
good corrosion resistance, carbon materials are widely used as elec-
trodes in most commercial supercapacitors. However, the low energy
density of carbon-based supercapacitors (3–5 W·h kg−1), which is
dramatically lower than electrochemical batteries (or even lead acid
batteries) by almost an order of magnitude, limits their applica-
tion in energy storage devices for vehicles or solar power units [386].
To improve the energy density, as well as the specific capacitance,
of carbon-based electrodes, transition metal oxides, including TiO2,

20

S.Q. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 1–59

V2O5, Mn3O4, Fe2O3, Co3O4, NiO, CuO, ZnO, RuO2, SnO2, and WO3, have
been attempted to be deposited on carbon materials to make CMO
nanocomposites, after the pioneering work of transition metal oxides
as anode materials [389]. So far the demonstrated syntheses method
of CMO nanocomposite mainly include: (1) hydrothermal,
solvothermal, photochemical or chemical syntheses; (2) chemical
vapor deposition, electrodeposition, and electrochemical deposi-
tion; and (3) microwave-assisted, or ultrasound-assisted syntheses;
and others. Synthesizing various kinds of dimensional (0-D, 1-D, 2-D,
and 3-D) carbon nanostructures enable us to tailor flexibly the prop-
erties of the CMO nanocomposites.

As aforementioned, flame aerosol synthesis has a demon-
strated history of scalability and offers the potential for high-
volume commercial production, at reduced costs, for synthesis of
either metal-oxide nanoparticles or commercial carbon black ma-
terials. However, studies on flame aerosol synthesis of carbon–
metal oxide nanocomposites are surprisingly scarce, despite their
promise and need in applications involving energy storage and
battery materials. A number of studies on flame synthesis of carbon
nanotubes and other carbon nanostructures have been reviewed,
including a recent paper in PECS [17]. Therefore, in this section, from
the point of view of carbon nanostructures, we first provide a brief
review on flame “aerosol” synthesis of carbon nanomaterials (gov-
erned by the aerosol nucleation/coagulation route given in Fig. 1)
mainly from the combustion community. Then, a prospect of the
scalable synthesis of CMO nanocomposites by flame aerosol syn-
thesis is discussed.

4.1. Various carbon nanostructures from flame aerosol synthesis

For carbon-based nanoproducts, the flame aerosol synthesis route
is especially well suited, possessing an intrinsically cheaper source
of process heat than any other technique, since the hydrocarbon gas
provides both the enthalpy and reagent needed for synthesis. There-
fore, it is already widely used to produce commercial products in
tonnage quantities such as carbon black.

4.1.1. Fullerenes (0-D)

The entangled relationship between soot and fullerenic
nanostructures formations in flames has been shown in work dem-
onstrating the synthesis of fullerenes and CNTs in sooting flames.
Much of the first work on fullerene synthesis in flames were done
by Homann and co-workers [390,391] and Howard and co-workers
[392–394] using premixed benzene/oxygen flames, with and without
inert diluent gas, at low-pressures (<40 torr). Later, experiments [395]
were conducted using diffusion flames.

In the premixed configuration, Howard and co-workers [393] in-
vestigated burner-stabilized laminar flat flames (McKenna burner
in Fig. 2b). Samples of condensable flame species, including PAHs,
fullerenes, and soot, were collected a different distance from the
burner through a quartz probe, and analyzed by high-performance
liquid chromatography to determine the yields of fullerenes. They
observed a “first” formation region of fullerenes early in the flame,
occurring simultaneously with a large rate of PAH consumption, sug-
gesting that the route of fullerenes formation involves reactions of
PAH. The observed “second” region, which occurred later in the
flame, accounted for most of the fullerenes mass produced, imply-
ing a route more consistent with stepwise acetylene addition
mechanism. Nonetheless, they found that in both regions, fullerenes
consumption involved reactions between fullerenes and soot. Ad-
ditionally, measurements indicated that the different PAHs grew
roughly simultaneously, reached a peak concentration, and decayed
together in a consumption process that occurred concurrently
with a rapid rise in soot mass concentration early in the flame, rep-
resenting a behavior consistent with the major soot formation being

from PAH and occurring along with the minor fullerenes forma-
tion in their flame.

In the same configuration, Homann and co-workers [391] noticed
the dependence of fullerenes and soot production on tempera-
ture. They detected a new class of “particles,” named aromers (due
to their structural properties), in flames existing prior to both
fullerenes and soot particles. Arguing that the products of these
aromers are determined by the flame temperature and the con-
centration of growth species such as acetylene, they found that at
high temperatures and with relatively low concentrations of acet-
ylene, these aromers formed fullerenes, while at low temperatures
and/or high concentrations of small growth species, mainly soot was
formed.

On the other hand, in the diffusion flame configuration, Howard
and co-workers [395] found the maximum flame temperature to
be of minor importance in fullerene formation; instead, residence
time was the key parameter. They employed a low-pressure laminar
jet flame, with argon-diluted benzene flowing within a co-flow of
oxygen (as shown in Fig. 2a), and analyzed samples of condens-
able material at axial distances along the flame. The highest
concentration of fullerenes was always detected just above the visible
stoichiometric surface of a flame. Moreover, the percentage of
fullerenes in the condensable material increased with decreasing
pressure, with the overall highest amount of fullerenes associated
with a surprisingly high dilution of fuel with argon. These effects
were attributed to flame length (and hence residence time), where
a shorter flame, resulting from high dilution or lower pressure, favors
the formation of fullerenes rather than soot. At the same time, the
amount of soot and precursors of both soot and fullerenes were
reduced, indicating a stronger correlation of fullerene consump-
tion to the total amount of soot than of fullerene formation to
precursor concentration. The HRTEM analysis of the soot showed
an increase of the curvature of the carbon layers, and hence in-
creased fullerenic character, with increasing distance from the burner
up to the point of maximum fullerene concentration. After this
maximum, where soot and fullerenes were consumed by oxida-
tion, the curvature decreased. In addition to the soot, the samples
included fullerenic nanostructures such as tubes and spheroids in-
cluding highly-ordered multi-layered or onion-like structures. The
soot itself showed highly ordered regions of ongoing fullerenic
nanostructure formation.

4.1.2. Carbon nanotubes (1-D)

The carbon nanotube (CNT), possessing 1-D nanostructure, has
relatively smaller surface area as compared with the 0-D fullerene.
However, the high conductivities of 1-D nanostructures are found
to be greatly helpful to the redox activities of transition metal oxides,
resulting in much higher rate capability. With respect to flame
aerosol synthesis, earlier in 1994, Duan and McKinnon [396] ob-
served CNTs randomly distributed in the soot in rich benzene-air
premixed flames at low pressure. In 1995, Chowdhury et al. [397]
studied low-pressure benzene, acetylene, and ethylene premixed
flames, finding the presence of various fullerene nanoparticles and
some CNTs on collection probes.

Later, metal catalyst nanoparticles were specifically seeded into
sooting flames to synthesize carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Several
models have been proposed to explain CNT formation, such as the
Baker growth mechanism [398], the vapor–liquid–solid mecha-
nism [399], and the yarmulke (skull-cap) mechanism [400]. What
is generally observed is that carbon precursors, e.g. alkane, alkene,
alcohol, or CO, decompose on transition metal nanoparticles, and
can precipitate on one side of the nanoparticles, forming CNTs [401].
However, if the CNT growth conditions are not optimal, carbon can
completely encapsulate the nanoparticles, deactivating them, which
is the most likely scenario [402]. As such, in the flame aerosol route,
synthesis of catalyst nanoparticles is concurrent with growth of CNTs,

S.Q. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 1–59

21

under the right conditions. For example in the Yarmulke or “skull-
cap” mechanism, a metallic catalytic particle removes hydrogen
atoms from adsorbed hydrocarbons, liberating carbon to diffuse along
the length and attach to the open edges of the forming nanotube
[400]. The shape of the “cap” comes from the newly-arriving carbon
atoms forming the carbon lattice that follows the spherical shape
of the catalyst particle [402,403]. Possibility exists for a second ‘cap,’
as well as additional ones, to form above the first one surrounding
the catalyst, allowing more layers of carbon to form, thus result-
ing in the growth of multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs). Nonetheless,
in the Yarmulke mechanism, the diameter of the nanotube is gov-
erned by the size of the catalyst particle, explaining the often found
correlation between particle size and CNT diameter in the litera-
ture [404,405]. It has been furthermore observed by Vander Wal
and Hall [404] that 1 nm diameter Fe catalytic particles formed
single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), while 1–10 nm catalyst par-
ticles formed MWNTs.

Earlier, Diener et al. [406] had achieved synthesis of SWNTs at
reduced pressures in fuel-rich acetylene and ethylene surface-
mixing flames when metallocenes were added. While no SWNTs
could be synthesized using benzene as fuel, long metal-filled MWNTs
with many defects were abundant. Their experimental results sug-
gested that the best fuels for combustion synthesis of fullerenes are
the worst for combustion synthesis of SWNTs, and vice-versa. Acet-
ylene flames were barely capable of producing fullerenes, while
indene flames had even higher fullerene yields than benzene flames.
Since a suggested route of fullerenes formation in flames pro-
ceeds from a phenyl ring through PAHs, which knit together aromers
[391] and/or grow by acetylene addition [407] and (in the correct
pressure and temperature range) finally rearrange to become a
fullerene [408], uncombusted benzene seeds PAH formation, jump-
starting fullerene formation. In contrast, the growth from acetylene
into a phenyl ring occurs relatively slowly in comparison to ring
growth reactions. They also suggested that it may be possible to
produce SWNTs in an acetylene flame without a lot of soot
byproduct, if all of the acetylenic carbon can be converted to SWNTs
before soot formation is initiated.

As mentioned above, CNTs can be produced in non-sooting
flames. Vander Wal and co-workers [409] demonstrated synthesis
of SWNTs at atmospheric pressure via a simple laboratory-scale dif-
fusion flame, using different hydrocarbon reagents and inert dilution.
They observed that dilution of the fuel stream with an inert gas,
either nitrogen or argon, was critical to CNT synthesis. Absence of
the inert carrier resulted in soot formation and the complete en-
capsulation of the metal nanoparticles within a carbonaceous matrix
with no CNTs being formed. They argued that the net effect of an
inert additive is to decrease the rates of PAH formation and soot
growth reactions, both of which deplete the hydrocarbon reagent
pool and produce species/compounds that deactivate the catalyst
particles. They proposed that dissociative adsorption is likely the
first step in the growth of the SWNTs, given an active metal cata-
lyst particle. Since C2 species readily undergo dissociative adsorption,
acetylene becomes essential to the molecular growth path of the
CNT.

On the other hand, without catalysts, Merchan-Merchan et al.
[410] found that MWNTs were produced in a counter-flow oxy-
methane diffusion flame on the fuel-rich side of the flame front at
an oxygen enrichment of 50% (shown in Fig. 2c). The MWNTs were
mixed with soot aggregates and carbon nanoclusters. They gave a
phenomenological explanation of CNT formation through pyroly-
sis of hydrocarbons resulting from an increase of radicals due to
oxygen enrichment. Such non-catalytic growth of CNTs has long been
postulated, especially in flames where very high temperatures can
be achieved.

With the aerosol route, long SWNTs are also achievable. Unrau
et al. [411] utilized an ethylene–oxygen inverse diffusion flame

seeded with ferrocene to produce and collect SWNTs 1–3 nm in di-
ameter and 200 nm–1 μm in length.

Many researchers have studied premixed flames to synthesize
CNTs. Vander Wal and co-workers [412,413] used premixed co-
flow flames to grow SWNTs by seeding the fuel line with ferrocene
and compositions of metal nitrates serving as catalyst precursors.
Ferrocene-generated Fe nanoparticles were able to produce bundles
of self-assembled SWNT with diameters as small as 2 nm. In one
configuration (i.e. pyrolysis flame) [412], the catalyst precursor
aerosol was supplied through the metal tube inside of the flame,
where there is no combustion, but there is enough heat supplied
by the reaction outside of the tube for nanotube formation to occur.
In some cases, acetylene flames with Fe and Ni [412,414] catalysts
resulted in significant yields of SWNTs [412–414] and MWNTs [414].
These results showed that the size of the metal catalyst directly in-
fluenced the size of the CNT. Moreover, as the diameter of the catalyst
particle increased, the yield of SWNTs decreased, and their length
became shorter [412]. Another interesting observation was that tem-
perature played a negligible role in CNT growth from Fe particles.
However, Vander Wal and Ticich [415] also found that a cata-
lyst particle can initially be larger than the subsequent CNT. Yet, for
that to happen, the particle would have to be broken up in the flame
so that the smaller catalyst fragments can facilitate CNT growth.
Another observation was that the increase of CO resulted in in-
creased encapsulation of CNTs by amorphous carbon. Fe was noted
to lead to higher CNT yield than that for Ni. A further study sug-
gested that Fe catalyst might be more appropriate for SWNT growth,
while Ni catalyst might be better used for nanofiber growth [404].
They suggested that Fe particles are catalytically active at smaller
diameters than Ni, thus resulting in the growth of smaller diame-
ter structures, such as SWNTs.

Height et al. [416] also utilized premixed co-flow flames to grow
SWNTs. A detailed characterization of SWNT growth was given with
emphasis on flame position and air-to-fuel ratio. Goel et al. [417]
compared premixed and diffusion flames for benzene/oxygen flames.
They found that CNT yield was more favorable in diffusion flames
than in premixed flames, for their setups. CNTs were only ob-
served in the premixed flame when the residence time was increased
considerably higher than that of the diffusion flame counterpart.
Height et al. [418] utilized an acetylene flame with vaporized
Fe(CO)5 acting as a catalyst precursor to generate SWNTs. Nanotubes
were collected using a thermophoretic sampling probe at various
positions above the flame at equivalence ratios ranging from 1.5 to
1.9 and flame temperatures from 1500 to 1800 K. Discrete carbon
particles were found to be dominant at the lower equivalence ratios,
while soot began to contaminate CNT yield closer to Φ = 1.9.

Tse’s research group [419] examined rich ethylene–air pre-
mixed flames in divergence-stabilized stagnation-point geometry
(shown in Fig. 2-f.1), seeded with vaporized ferrocene Fe(C5H5)2, to
deposit CNTs on a substrate. The equivalence ratios were below the
threshold for sooting. Short aspect ratio MWNTs, similar to those
found by Merchan-Merchan et al. [410], were deposited on the sub-
strate, despite short residence times. Longer carbon nanofibers were
grown in methane–air flames, but no CNTs.

4.1.3. Graphene flakes (2-D)

To the best knowledge of the authors, there have been no avail-
able publications on the flame aerosol synthesis of graphene flakes.
Although not flame synthesis, Frenklach and co-workers [420,421]
synthesized graphene-flakes using atmospheric-pressure micro-
wave plasmas injected with liquid ethanol droplets, paving the way
for the gas-phase route. By flame aerosol synthesis, the closest re-
search is by Minutolo et al. [422], who produced two-dimensional
carbon nanostructures using an atmospheric pressure ethylene/
air laminar premixed flame, stabilized on a McKenna burner, with
an equivalent ratio of 1.83. The collected samples revealed a network

22

S.Q. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 1–59

of aromatic compounds connected by non-aromatic bonding to form
atomically-thin disk-like structures. The demonstration of such gas-
phase synthesis has implications for large-scale production of
graphene, along with the possibility that flame synthesis may also
achieve such results, presenting an area ripe for research.

Interestingly, flame aerosol synthesis differs from another typical
flame synthesis method, flame-assisted CVD-type process, in that
the residence time in flame aerosol reactor is significantly higher
than the precursor chemical reaction time (τres < < τchem), and vice
versa, as seen detail in Section 4.1. Tse and co-workers developed
a multi-element inverse-diffusion-flame burner, in which the
radially-uniform post-flame gas species are deposited on a sub-
strate. By using this novel flame-assisted CVD method, it was
demonstrated that few-layer graphene can be grown on copper and
nickel substrates in open environments at high rates [333].

4.1.4. Nanodiamond (3-D)

Although scalable flame aerosol synthesis of nanodiamond (ND)
would be extremely-appealing, there seems to be limited studies
in the area, particularly compared with dozens of studies on
flame-assisted CVD of diamond film. Since the 1980s, combustion-
related synthesis of diamond particles has been accomplished by
the detonation of explosives with a negative oxygen balance in steel
containers under vacuum conditions [423–425]. Although
nanodiamond synthesis by explosive detonation is still widely em-
ployed, the process is batch-to-batch and not continuous, with
purification processes needed.

One of the few flame-based synthesis of nanodiamond was ac-
complished by Frenklach and co-workers [426]. Cubic and hexagonal
diamond nanoparticles (10–500 nm in diameter) were created by
microwave-assisted low-pressure (<150 Torr) combustion of acet-
ylene in oxygen, in both premixed and diffusion flames. Lower reactor
pressure and higher C to O atomic ratios resulted in larger particle
sizes. Only C to O atomic ratios between 0.83 and 1.0 produced crys-
talline diamond nanoparticles, with other ratios yielding graphite,
soot, and amorphous carbon phases. Again, this should be a fertile
research area with regards to the scalable production of ND.

4.2. Flame aerosol synthesis of carbon–metal oxides

Carbon can be readily doped into metal-oxide nanoparticles. For
example, using a low-pressure acetylene–oxygen premixed flame
injected with TTIP, Chen et al. [427] synthesized carbon-doped titania
nanopowders, which showed visible-light photocatalytic ability. They
suggested that carbon species associated with catalytic sites on the
anatase surface allow carriers generated by photon absorption to
transfer quickly onto catalytic sites and perform the subsequent cata-
lytic reactions. Similarly, Al-Sharab et al. [428] have also synthesized
carbon-doped titania nanoparticles using low pressure premixed
flames, for applications in solar cells. The rapid development of flame
spray pyrolysis (FSP) or flame-assisted spray pyrolysis (FASP) tech-
niques in the past two decades enables one-step aerosol synthesis
of carbon–metal oxide nanocomposites. Ko et al. [387] demon-
strated a novel FSP-type fabrication of carbon–manganese oxide
(carbon–Mn3O4) composite with open nanochannels, and then char-
acterized their electrochemical performance as anode materials for
lithium ion batteries. The aqueous spray solution was prepared by
dissolving 0.2 M manganese acetate (as can be found in Table A1)
and 0.5 M sucrose in distilled water, where the sucrose served as
the carbon source. Subsequently, polystyrene nanobeads were added
to the clear solution, in a weight ratio of 1.55:1 with respect to Mn3O4.
As shown in Fig. 9, the amorphous-like Mn3O4 nanoparticles are em-
bedded in a carbon matrix with three-dimensional channels. The
nucleation and crystal growth process occur in the rear part of the
high-temperature diffusion flame (~2500 °C), producing Mn3O4
nanopowders, with a mean size around 42 nm, as deduced from TEM

images shown in Fig. 9(a). For carbon-free Mn3O4 nanopowders, the
high resolution TEM image as shown in Fig. 9(b) reveals the single
crystalline structure of the Mn3O4, whereas the dot-mapping images,
as shown in Fig. 9(c), show the carbon-free Mn3O4 nanopowders,
indicating the well-dispersed nature of Mn3O4 nanoparticles in the
carbon matrix. This kind of structure may lead to the design of
compact energy storage devices.

Interestingly, using hot-wall heating instead of flame, Zachariah
and co-workers [388] developed an aerosol spray pyrolysis process
to synthesize homogeneously unique amorphous carbon–MnOx
nanocomposite particles, as shown in Fig. 10(a, b). Such a struc-
ture effectively accelerates the conversion reaction, preventing the
agglomeration of Mn metal grains during the conversion reaction
with Li, thus significantly improving cyclability. The unique struc-
ture of the amorphous carbon–MnOx nanoparticles has provided the
best anode performance for manganese oxide to date, implying FSP
can be a very promising technique for electrode material
manufacture.

As for other kinds of carbon–metal oxide structures, metal-
oxide nanoparticles have been coated on the surface of carbon
nanofibers to form typical core-shell structures, in which the
nanofiber not only serves as the physical backbone support but also
offers the charge transport channel, while the metal oxide im-
proves the specific capacitance and energy density [386]. However,
such nanostructures have not yet been to be reported using flame
aerosol synthesis. The scalable flame aerosol synthesis of 2-D carbon
nanostructure (like graphene) supporting metal oxides are of tre-
mendous desirability. 2-D graphene possesses high surface area, high
electronic conductivity, and high mechanical strength, which are
greatly beneficial to the improvement in the charge/discharge ki-
netics of supercapacitor and battery electrodes. Addressing flame
aerosol synthesis to produce such kinds of functional structures is
both an opportunity and a challenge to investigators in the field.
Indeed, future combination of flame aerosol synthesis and flame-
assisted CVD may be quite worthwhile.

5. Fabrication of functional nanostructured films and devices
by flame aerosol deposition

Thin micropatterned metal-oxide functional films are of great
relevance for a variety of applications, such as gas sensors, solar cells,
fuel cells, and catalytic reactors, in the fields of energy and envi-
ronment, material bio-interfaces, microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS), drug delivery, and medical diagnostics. The fabrication of
these films and devices is usually achieved through self-assembly
of nanoparticles in gas- or liquid-phase processes or through com-
paction of flame-made nanopowders. In this review, we focus on
gas sensing and photovoltaic applications, which are suitable topics
for energy and environmental concerns. The well-established pro-
cessing routes for preparing ceramic thin films include colloidal-
based wet coating processes, e.g., spin coating, slip coating, dip
coating, etc., and dry aerosol-based particle deposition, e.g.
electrospray deposition, plasma spray deposition, and flame aerosol
deposition (FAD) [9,209]. Wet-based processes require time inten-
sive and often complex procedures to reduce capillary stresses or
particle agglomeration, along with environmental concerns of liquid
byproducts [209]. In contrast, dry processes not only exclude these
disadvantages because of the direct deposition of particles from the

gas phase, but also are much simpler and require fewer unit op-
erations. Comparatively, electrospray deposition is generally
constrained in its throughput by charging effects, and plasma spray
deposition has relatively high energy consumption. As a result, flame
aerosol deposition exists as one of most economically scalable means
for the fabrication of functional films and devices.

Based on the feeding state of precursors, the flame aerosol de-
position method includes two routes, FSP-based and VAFS-based
ones. The former is established by placing a substrate down-
stream of the flame spray pyrolysis burner, as shown in Fig. 2g; while
the latter is formed by placing a substrate downstream of the pre-
mixed stagnation flame (PSF) burner, as shown in Fig. 2f(1–4).
However, despite many studies on flame aerosol deposition in the
past ten years [9,10,247–258,306,348–358], the underlying physics
governing the deposition and assembly mechanisms, as well as the
core technology dominating industrial operation and product speci-
fications, are still not very well understood or explored. In this review,
one of the goals is to extract important “problems” from previous
studies so that they can be appropriately studied in the near future.

5.1. Controlling diagram of various deposition regimes: CVD vs. FAD

To begin with, we shall distinguish the differences between flame
aerosol deposition and the well-known commercial chemical vapor
deposition of materials science. Based on experimental findings,
Biswas and co-workers summarized three deposition and film
growth mechanisms: (i) vapor dominant regime (basically CVD pro-
ducing dense films), (ii) vapor–particle mixed regime (producing
columnar films), and (iii) particle dominant regime (termed as FAD
producing granular films) [357,429], as seen on the left side of Fig. 11.
Classification of the deposition mechanism is dependent on the com-
petition of various characteristic time scales in the flame synthesis
process, such as residence time in the reactor (τres), chemical reac-
tion time of the precursor (τchem), sintering time (τsint), and collision
time (τcoll) [429]. In the vapor dominated (CVD) regime, the resi-
dence time is significantly lower than the precursor chemical reaction
time (τres < < τchem); thus the vapor only reacts on the substrate, re-
sulting in the formation of a dense film. In the particle dominated
(FAD) regime, the residence time is much longer than the chemi-
cal reaction time (τres > τchem); and the particles form before deposition

Fig. 11. Illustration of three deposition and film growth mechanisms (left) and its controlling diagram (right) as functions of particle diameter and size distribution func-
tion of particle number concentration. When the residence time is much smaller than the chemical reaction time, vapor deposits on the plate and forms a dense smooth
film, corresponding to “chemical vapor deposition.” When the residence time is larger than the chemical reaction time, as-synthesized particles deposit on the plate and
form the dense granular film, corresponding to “aerosol deposition.” When the residence time is smaller or comparative to the chemical reaction time, mixture of vapor
and particles deposits on the plate and forms a columnar film, corresponding to mixed deposition regime. (Reprinted from An et al., 2009 [429].)

24

on the substrate, resulting in highly-porous granular films. The par-
ticle dominated regime can be further sub-divided into two pathways
based on the competition between the collision time and sinter-
ing time of particles, i.e. individual particle deposition (IPD) when
τsint < τcoll < τres, and agglomerated particle deposition (APD) when
τcoll < τsint < τres [357]. Finally, if the residence and reaction times are
competitive with similar magnitude, then a mixed particle–vapor
mixture deposits on the substrate, resulting in the growth of co-
lumnar structured films. As for their applications for solar energy
conversion, in contrast to the dense and columnar films, the porous
granular film (>95% porosity) greatly exceeds a requirement of about
40% porosity for efficient electron transport in films. Because of these
differences in electron transport and lifetime in the TiO2 film, the
columnar morphology outperformed the granular morphology,
achieving a UV-light to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 11% for
water splitting and a visible light to electricity conversion efficien-
cy of 6.0% for dye-sensitized solar cell [358].

A controlling diagram portraying the three regimes, i.e. chem-
ical vapor deposition, aerosol deposition, and the mixed one, can
be plotted with the particle diameter as the abscissa and the size
distribution function of particle number concentration as the or-
dinate, as shown in the right half of Fig. 11. Here, in order to avoid
the complexity induced by the flame, a cleaner system of diffusion-
dominated aerosol chemical deposition process (ACVD) was specially
designed to study this deposition diagram [429], in which the heat
is provided from the substrate itself, instead of flame, depressing
thermophoretic deposition, which will be detailed later in Section
5.3. By using a population balance model (as seen in Section 7) imple-
mented in a stagnation-point flow geometry (with nozzle gas
mean velocity of 0.2–0.5 m/s, and correspondingly strain rate of 20–
50 s−1, with a nozzle-to-substrate distance of 10 mm), the
experimental data of ACVD are theoretically interpreted as three
kinds of curves (blue, red, and black), as shown in the right of Fig. 11.
The zone above the blue color line is the aerosol deposition (AD)
regime for producing porous granular films. Parenthetically, com-
pared with the diffusion-dominated AD, the thermophoresis-
favored FAD more easily results in the granular regime under the
same particle diameters and concentrations, as deduced from
Section 5.3. The zone below the black color line is CVD regime for
producing dense films. The zone encompassed by red color lines
is the vapor–particle mixed regime for creating columnar films, while
the other zones are intermediate or unclear ones to be explored.
Basically, the crystalline sizes measured by XRD (dXRD) or the spe-
cific surface area (SSA) sizes of the nanoparticles in the FSP-
deposited films are about 10–20 nm; and usually those made by

PSF-deposition are much smaller at 5–10 nm. Nevertheless, they are
all larger than 1.6 nm as given in the plot of Fig. 11, evincing an FAD
regime for porous granular film.

So far, the well-demonstrated flame deposition processes for
the fabrication of thin films mainly include: (i) the first category
for CVD technique, i.e., combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD)
for oxide dense films (first proposed by Hunt, Carter, and Cochran
[430,431] at Georgia Tech and subsequently developed by Liu et al.
[432]), along with the CCVD-like technique termed flame-assisted
vapor deposition (FAVD) by Choy and co-workers [433] at the Im-
perial College for synthesis of LSM (La1−xSrxMnO3-δ)/YSZ; (ii) the
second category for FAD technique, i.e., VAFS-based process de-
tailed in Section 5.5 and FSP-based process in Section 5.6,
respectively; and (iii) the combined flame-assisted aerosol–
chemical vapor deposition process [434]. In contrast to CVD using
gas species as the depositing carrier, the sizes of particles before
their deposition in the FAD process are of great significance. Basi-
cally, the crystalline sizes measured by XRD (dXRD) or the specific
surface area (SSA) sizes of the nanoparticles in the FSP-deposited
films are about 10–20 nm; and usually those made by FSP-based
VAFS deposition are much smaller at 3–10 nm because of the high
quenching rates. Remarkably, between these two kinds of VAFS-
and FSP-deposition techniques, Maric and co-workers [435–439]
have developed a scalable novel flame deposition process, also
known as reactive spray deposition technology (RSDT), which can
achieve extra narrow particle-size distributions of 0.5–2 nm for pre-
deposited nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the sizes of particles in most
FAD processes are usually larger than 1.6 nm, as seen in the plot
of Fig. 11, showing an FAD regime for porous granular film. The
larger the particles are, the more porous the film is.

5.2. Key parameters controlling flame aerosol deposition

In the FAD regime, when τres > τchem, the morphology of granu-
lar films is directly determined by the deposition/sintering process
on the substrate after the formation of particles in the flow field.
Based on the premixed stagnation flame burner, as shown in
Fig. 2(f.4), Li and co-workers systematically examined the roles of
two important operating parameters, i.e. precursor concentration
and substrate temperature, in controlling SSA and porosity of nano-
films [10]. As shown in Fig. 12, two distinct regimes were clarified
at different substrate temperatures. At low temperatures (T = 383 K),
particles are promptly frozen after deposition on the cold sub-
strate, as the on-substrate sintering is quite low. The SSA of the
produced films mainly depends on the collision–coalescence process

of 383 K, while the filled squares correspond to a substrate temperature of 763 K. TEM images on the right-hand side show the morphologies of the nanofilms at (a) 116.4 ppm
and (b) 291.0 ppm, for a substrate temperature of 763 K. (Reprinted with permission from Zhang et al., 2012 [10].)

the deposition mechanisms of microparticles by considering the
competition between thermophoresis and convection (while ig-
noring Brownian motion) [440]. Mädler et al. estimated the
contribution of thermophoresis, Brownian diffusion, and convec-
tion, and directly established a thermophoresis-controlled deposition
model [256]. More recently, Li and co-workers developed a strictly-
derived mathematical model of nanoparticle deposition consisting
of convection-dominated, transition, and thermophoresis-dominated
regimes, successively, from the outside flame ambience to the inner
thermal boundary layer [359], as schematically shown in Fig. 13(a).
The transport and deposition of particles via convection,

thermophoresis, and diffusion can be expressed as

(5.1)

where U is the velocity field at the boundary layer; c is the number
density of particles; vth is the thermophoretic velocity of particles;
and D is the diffusion coefficient of particles. With the boundary
layer assumption, Eqn. (5.1) is simplified to

Fig. 13(b) plots the profiles of thermophoretic velocity, axial gas
velocity, and temperature versus axial position. In the convection-
dominated regime, thermophoretic velocity is much smaller than
the axial velocity, and particle diffusion can also be ignored due to
the large Sc number (~102). Therefore, the simplified relationship
in the convection-dominated regime can be expressed as

in the gas-phase flame, which is termed as the in-flame-agglomeration
regime. In this regime, as the precursor concentration increases from
29.1 ppm to 116.4 ppm, SSA dramatically decreases from 313.2 to
188.3 m2/g, because high as-synthesized particle concentrations di-
rectly determine the large particle sizes and SSA of the films.

In contrast, at high substrate temperatures (763 K), the SSA of
film is not controlled by the collision–coalescence process of par-
ticles in the gas-phase, but by the sintering process upon particle
deposition on the substrate. Because the characteristic sintering time
of solid-state particles is proportional to the particle volume, the
sintering rate reduces rapidly for larger particles. Therefore, on-
substrate sintering slows down exponentially with sintering degree
of the film, and the particle size has an upper limit after suffi-
ciently long sintering duration. As shown in Fig. 12, the SSA of
synthesized films is narrow at a small range of 91.4–129.7 m2/g, with
increasing precursor concentration from 58.2 to 116.4 ppm. Since
particles have been sufficiently sintered on the substrate, this regime
is termed as “on-substrate-sintering”-controlled one.

A criterion to distinguish the above two regimes is the location
of particle growth. In flame aerosol deposition using the stagna-
tion flow configuration, particle sizes before deposition are mainly
determined by precursor concentrations under a designed flame
field, whereas particle sizes after deposition are mainly controlled
by substrate temperature, as summarized in the literature by Li and
co-workers [10]. However, in other flame synthesis cases, large par-
ticle sizes, which may arise from higher concentrations, higher flame
temperatures, longer residence time, or changing from VAPS to FSP,
can still reduce the sintering rates on the substrate even at high
surface temperatures. In these cases, the “on-substrate-sintering”
regime will revert back to the “in-flame-agglomeration” one.

As for the porosity of synthesized films, on the other hand, the
key controlling factors are the direct motion of particles toward the
substrate caused by thermophoresis (in most cases) and the Brown-
ian diffusion of particles induced by the impaction of gas molecules.
The direct motion of particles will lead to the particles penetrat-
ing toward inner depths of the films until the Brownian stochastic
motion causes their collision with prior-deposited agglomerates.
Thus, small Brownian motion and large thermophoresis of par-
ticles will cause a large penetration depth of particles, resulting in
a high packing density. Additionally, high precursor concentration
will lead to a large particle size with small Brownian motion and
thus more densely-packed films. The effect of substrate tempera-
ture on packing density is relatively weak as it has counteractive
influence on thermophoresis, Brownian motion, and on-substrate
sintering. In general, high substrate temperatures (>700 K) will lead
to high packing density of films, as sintering will dominate.

Another important factor in controlling film porosity is the ag-
glomeration process. Mädler et al. [257,612] studied the effect of
agglomerate morphology, including the size and number of primary
particles and fractal number on deposition in a simulation study
by solving the Langevin equation. Film porosity increases with in-
creasing number of primary particles and decreases with higher
fractal number. Film porosity only increases with primary particle
size when diffusion dominates the deposition process because the
deposition velocity will not change with primary particle size when
thermophoresis dominates. Based on their simulation and analy-
sis, the agglomerates behave with similar transport physics, but
provide larger areas for interception, forming more porous films.

5.3. Characterization of particle deposition in boundary layers

Apart from film penetration and sintering on the substrate,
another important stage is the transport of nanoparticles within the
boundary layer. To further detail the deposition mechanism during
this stage, various models of particle transport and deposition within
boundary layers have been established. Batchelor and Shen studied

Fig. 13. Characterization of the laminar boundary layer above a stagnation plane for
particle deposition by comparing the profiles between gas velocity and thermophoretic
velocity. (The Reynolds number for the stagnation jet is around 1500, the stagnation
strain rate is around 60 s−1, and the temperature of gas outside the boundary layer is
about 1700 K). (Reprinted with permission from Zhang et al., 2012 [359].)

26

where c0 and ρ0 are the number density of particles and the density
of gas, respectively, the upstream of the boundary layer. This rela-
tionship indicates that the ratio of the particle number to the gas
density is constant, and the change of particle number density is
mainly attributed to the higher density gas (e.g. by way of ideal gas)
near the cold boundary layer.

In the thermophoresis-dominated regime within the inner sta-
tionary layer, convection is negligible compared with thermophoretic
velocity. Defining non-dimensional variables, C = c/c1 and Z = z/δst,
where c1 is the number density of particles at the outside of sta-
tionary layers and δst is the thickness of the stationary layer, Eqn.
(5.2) can be simplified as:

(5.5)

The change of vth is generally within 10% under the studied cases,
and δst is very small such that variations of D can be ignored. Here,
Peth = vthδst/D is defined as the thermophoretic Peclet number de-
scribing the ratio of thermophoresis and diffusion flux. With the
boundary conditions of C|Z=0 = 0, C|Z=1 = 1, Eqn. (5.1) can be solved
analytically; and the solutions of the number density of particles
and the deposition flux are:

(5.7)

When Peth is larger than 1, i.e. thermophoresis is greater than dif-
fusion, the right-hand side of Eqn. (5.6) approaches 1; and the
deposition flux is equal to the thermophoretic flux of particles. As
shown in Fig. 14, when the particle size is larger than 4 nm, the
thermophoretic Peclet number is much larger than 1, and the Brown-
ian diffusion of particles contributes little to the deposition of particles.
As for the entire boundary layer, the particle concentration can
be solved directly from Eqn. (5.2). The particle concentration will
first increase slightly because of the higher gas density in the
convection-dominated regime. At the thermophoresis-dominated
regime, the particle concentration does not change significantly as
indicated by Eqn. (5.5), when Peth is much greater than 1. Finally,
the particle concentration drops rapidly after entering the concen-
tration boundary layer, which is determined by diffusion and
thermophoresis together. In general, the concentration boundary
layer is much thinner than the stationary layer, and the variation of
particle diameter will not influence the deposition flux. However,
small particle size (<2 nm) will lead to a comparable diffusion flux

Fig. 14. Variation of normalized deposition flux φ/c1Vth obtained from Eqn. (5.7) and
corresponding thermophoretic Peclet number Peth, as functions of nanoparticle
diameter. (Reprinted with permission from Zhang et al., 2012 [359].)

with thermophoresis, increasing the concentration boundary layer
thickness equivalent to or even thicker than the stationary layer. In
this case, the peak particle concentration will be reduced, causing
a reduction in deposition flux.

5.4. Control of properties by electric field application

The use of force fields during the formation and deposition of
nanoparticles offers another potential tool for process control. The
application of electric fields stands as an advantageous means for
precise control of primary particle size, crystallinity, aggregate size
[1], and deposition characteristics. The effects of electric fields on
flames have been observed and reported in the literature for a long
time [441–444]. Past investigations of electric field application in
traditional hydrocarbon combustion systems have demonstrated
control of various flame characteristics (e.g. burning velocity
[445–447], stability [448,449], shape [450–452], luminosity
[453,454], extinction limit [455–457]) and pollutant formation (e.g.
soot [450,452,454,458], NOx [455,459]). In absence of particles, the
effects of an electric field on flames are now attributed to ion-
driven fluid-mechanical effects, known as ionic (or Chattock [460])
wind effect. Under an electric field, ions are accelerated preferen-
tially towards an electrode. At the same time, they collide with
neutral molecules, transferring a portion of their momentum to the
neutral molecules. The net result is that the electric field pro-
duces a significant body force or “ionic wind”. Owing to such
aerodynamics, the entire flow field can be affected, thereby influ-
encing flame characteristics.

Subjecting an external electric field to the particles during their
formation and deposition has been found to have a significant effect
on primary particle size, crystallinity, degree of aggregation, and ag-
glomerate size. Early on, Hardesty and Weinberg [324] showed that
the primary particle size of SiO2 powders was reduced by a factor
of 3 for a 6 kV potential in a Meker-burner-supported, premixed
methane/air flame. Katz and Hung [280,340] found an opposite trend
in particle size in a counter-flow diffusion H2/O2 flame when an elec-
tric field was applied across it. Regardless of the polarity of the
bottom electrode, dynamic laser scattering and TEM probing data
showed a significant increase in the diameter of the particles (TiO2,
SiO2, and GeO2) produced (a 3- to 10-fold increase in some cases)
compared with those produced without an electric field.

Much of the work in electrically-assisted flame synthesis of par-
ticles has been done by Pratsinis and coworkers [461–464]. They
have investigated flames in various geometries, generally with elec-
tric fields applied perpendicular to the direction of flow using needle-
shaped or plate electrodes. In Ref. 461, they produced ultrafine titania
particles generated from a jet CH4/air/Ar diffusion flame using a
corona discharge to charge the particles (for repulsion and disper-
sion) and to reduce residence time through ionic wind effects by
flow mixing. Increased electric potential reduced the particle size
and the rutile content. In Ref. 462, they produced TiO2, SiO2, and
SnO2 nanopowders generated by burner-stabilized flat flames and
nonstabilized laminar (Bunsen-like) flames. The fields (applied per-
pendicular to the direction of flow) were created either by needle
electrodes to introduce ions and wind in the flame or by plate elec-
trodes to merely attract flame-generated ions. The electric fields
reduced the primary particle size of TiO2, the agglomerate size of
SnO2, and both the agglomerate and primary size of SiO2. In Ref. 464,
they were able to reduce primary particle diameter (by a factor of
2) of fumed silica produced at high rates (up to 87 g/h) using a co-
flow double diffusion flame with needle electrodes.

Generally, external electric fields can affect flame synthesis in
two main aspects: (i) electric fields can change the flame field and
therefore change the histories of the nanoparticles; (ii) electric fields
can directly influence synthesized nanoparticles with electropho-
retic force FE that can affect the migration/drift velocity vE (≡FE/f,

27

where f is friction coefficient) in the left side of Eqn. (5.1), or with
electrostatic dispersion that can change the coagulation rate between
charged nanoparticles in the electric field.

The first aspect involves the electric aspect of the flame, which
has been reviewed in Refs. 443 and 465. Despite many debates, it
is generally believed that ‘ionic wind’, i.e. electro-hydrodynamic
effect, is predominantly responsible for flame changes upon weak,
sub-breakdown electric fields, as reported by Pratsinis and co-
workers. Similar results have also been observed by Katzer et al.
[466]. It should be noted that ionic winds, as a weak discharge, can
only affect convection in flames. Stronger discharge in plasma-
assisted combustion, such as nanosecond discharge, dielectric barrier
discharge, microwave discharge, and gliding arc, can change flame
structure by modifying the chemical reaction route apart from the
electro-hydrodynamic route, which presents the possibility of con-
trolling nanoparticle characteristics by adjusting the flame structure.
To remove the effect of ionic wind on the flame and to isolate
the electrophoretic effect of electric field on the transport behav-
iors of nanoparticles, Tse and co-workers [355] utilized a burner-
stabilized premixed stagnation flame with a uniform electric field
applied between the burner and the water-cooled substrate. By this
geometry, gas-phase temperature and chemical species profiles are
unaffected and only transport of the innately charged nanoparticles
(by thermionic emission) is induced. The electrophoretic trans-
port of particles can be expressed as vE·c in Eqn. (5.1), with signs
corresponding to the direction of the applied electric field, where
vE is the electro-migration velocity. The experimental results showed
that the electrophoretic effect can significantly increase/decrease
the residence time in the high temperature region of the flame and
therefore change the agglomeration process. Both agglomerate and
primary particle sizes decrease with concurrent electric field (the
substrate with negative voltages and the burner with grounded po-
tential) because of the shorter residence time of nanoparticles.
Moreover, electric fields can also change the coagulation rate by
charging nanoparticles because of electrostatic dispersion of
nanoparticles before their deposition on the substrate, as demon-
strated by Vermury et al. [462] and Katzer et al. [466] in the
experiments with needle electrode configurations. However, the elec-
trostatic dispersion effect is difficult to separate from ionic wind
effects and needs further investigations.

Apart from metal-oxide nanoparticles, electric fields have also
been utilized in controlling the packing structure of carbon
nanomaterials during flame synthesis. Kennedy and co-workers [467]
studied the alignment, growth rate, and structural variations of
carbon nanotubes (CNT) induced by electric fields. A conductive
metal-based catalytic probe, connected to an external voltage ranging
from 0.3–25 V, was positioned at the fuel side of a non-premixed
counter-flow flame. At low voltages below 1 V, the CNT array thick-
ness increases linearly with the applied voltages, while further
increase of the voltage begins to modify nanotube morphology. Dif-
ferent structures have been observed with increase of voltages, from
high purity vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) in the range
of 0.3–2 V, helically coiled CNTs at ~3 V, and CNTs with multi-
channels to multi-junctions at higher voltages. They argued that the
strong electric field at the tips of synthesized carbon nanotubes
induces a tensile force to generate the helically coiled structures and
help to form new catalytic sites for nanotube branching.

Xu et al. [468] similarly investigated the effect of voltage bias
on the metal probe/substrate on CNT growth in an inverse co-
flow diffusion flame. The results showed that voltage bias on the
substrate was conducive to aligning CNTs, as well as enhancing their
growth rates as compared to grounded conditions. Both negative
and positive voltages improved CNT alignment and growth (with
negative voltages working a bit better). They noted that operating
the probe/substrate in floating potential mode resulted in nega-
tive voltages (i.e. 24 mV, as induced by flame-generated ions and

electrons), along with well-aligned CNTs. This was corroborated with
experiments done using a counterflow diffusion flame [469].

Future application of electric fields between flame nozzles
and substrate should be directed at synthesizing functional
nanocomposite thin films, given such limited research at the
moment.

5.5. VAFS-based fabrication of thin films

In vapor-fed flame aerosol flame deposition, chemical reac-
tions are very fast, and particles are formed prior to their final
deposition on the substrate. Particularly in the premixed stagna-
tion flame configuration, thin films are fabricated composed of
primary ultrafine particles (around 10 nm or less) with large spe-
cific surface area (SSA), resulting in highly porous films. However,
high porosity also means low mechanical stability. Thus, direct VAFS-
grown films may not be a good choice for coating materials in a flow
environment. In addition, the electron transport in highly porous
granular films is largely restricted due to the discontinuity of the
neighboring particles, which results in poor performance in the ap-
plication of flame-made films for gas sensors and solar cells. In recent
research on VAFS-based fabrication of thin films, post-treatment
methods, including film densification and sintering, are becoming
more and more important to meet the various application demands.
As shown in Fig. 15(a), the flame stabilized on a rotating sub-
strate (FSRS) method (variation of the premixed stagnation flame
burner) has been demonstrated to be a successful operational con-
figuration for VAFS-based fabrication of thin films [306,348,470,471].
Developed by Wang and co-workers, the VAFS-fabricated method
is able to produce inexpensive films for gas sensors and solar cells,
as shown in Fig. 15(b, c). The flame in the setup is a premixed flat
flame generated from an aerodynamic nozzle, stabilized in a laminar
stagnating flow against a rotating plate, which is similar to the stag-
nation flames introduced in Fig. 2(f.3). The plate here is convectively
cooled so the particles are driven by thermophoresis to form the
thin film. In Fig. 15(d), TiO2 films are grown on the substrate by the
FSRS method [470]. The thickness of the film reaches 14 μm in
5 minutes, showing a high fabrication rate which is of value to both
research and manufacturing. The nascent film has a high porosity,
i.e. >90%; and the mean primary particle diameter composing the
film is 8–9 nm.

The densification process in FSRS-fabricated thin films is notable
as the porosity is effectively decreased to a desirable value, i.e. ~50%
after post-treatment. In the densification method, the as-synthesized
film is densified by wetting it with a solution of ethyl cellulose
(15 wt%) in ethanol. Then the wet film is heated stepwise to evap-
orate the ethanol and to stabilize a much denser structure. The
morphology change of the film after densification can also be seen
in Fig. 15(d). After such densification, only the porosity of the film
is changed; other properties like mean particle size are still main-
tained. Apart from adding ethyl cellulose, high-temperature
annealing/calcination is also a common densification method [105].
The annealing process can decrease the porosity and lower the con-
centration of defects. Nevertheless, the process will also cause some
grain growth, which may change the particle size distribution of the
film.

Fig. 15(b and c) are two different application tests on thin films
made through VAFS fabrication and densification. The perfor-
mance of gas sensing for CO is shown in Fig. 15(b). The baseline of
the resistance profile is quite stable, and no significant drift occurs
over time, demonstrating the stability and sensitivity toward CO
sensing [470]. The thin film is still sensitive under 5 ppm CO ex-
posure. In Fig. 15(c) the film is tested for photo-electric performance.
The photo-conversion efficiency reaches as high as 8.2%, with a short-
circuit current density of 20 mA/cm2, which is higher than those
of typical champion solar cells [471]. These desired features of the

film are attributed to the smaller particle size obtained by VAFS,
which provides good sensitivity and activity in application, as well
as good mechanical and chemical stability of the film after
densification.

5.6. FSP-based fabrication of functional film and devices

Different from VAFS-based fabrication utilizing the premixed stag-
nation flame, more functional films and devices can be made using
FSP, given its broader range of available precursors for synthesis and
doping. For example, a large variety of semiconducting metal-
oxide materials have been synthesized via FSP, which have been
partially included by Kemmler et al. in Table 1 in a previous review
[253]. In brief, SnO2, an n-type semiconductor, perhaps the most
successful semiconductor oxide, has been investigated in detect-
ing CO [256] and EtOH [93]. WO3, known to be non-stoichiometric
with two different stable crystalline phases [106,271], shows great
potential in NO2 gas detection [271]. ZnO is chemically and ther-
mally stable, and has high sensitivity to toxic and combustible gases
[156,162,210,211]. γ-Fe2O3 attracts research interest because of its
high sensitivity, low cost, quick response, and low power consump-
tion [174]. Co3O4 [472,473], CuO [474,475], and other p-type
semiconducting metal oxides indicate great potential in detecting
gases at low temperatures with low response and recovery time.
Moreover, surface sensitizers and bulk dopants can be easily added
in one-step in the FSP process, which is one of the most success-
ful strategies to improve the performance of functional films and
devices. It has been reported that Pt [253], Pd [202] and Cu [125]
are used for surface sensitizers, while Sb is used to tune the resis-
tivity of SnO2 as bulk dopants [249] and Sn for In2O3 [250]. As a
representative work, consider Pt-doped SnO2 [253], where the higher
the loading of a material with a noble metal, the higher the con-
version of dopants to analytes, instead of delivering electrons to the
conduction band of the semiconducting metal oxide. Therefore, an
optimum concentration exists for the incorporation of additives in
the precursors. The second important feature of FSP-fabricated func-
tional films is the relatively simple post-fabrication procedure, as
compared to the complex processes associated with liquid-based
methods. In a typical FSP-fabricated process, particles are directly
deposited onto a water-cooled substrate, ensuring a large

thermophoretic deposition rate. A mask is usually used to deposit
particles within the desired sensor area. Subsequently, the sensor
substrate with deposited particles is then tested in a DC electric
circuit to assess its sensitivity α, lower detection limit LDL, and re-
producibility Q, as defined by Mädler et al., under certain gaseous
environments [256].

However, due to the high-porosity, the deposited films may not
be mechanically stable, significantly limiting the use of FSP-
fabricated films in liquid environments. To solve this problem, Kühne
et al. and Tricoli et al. combined FSP with recent advances in
microtechnology and developed a new generation of micromachined,
smart, single-chip gas sensors, based on the direct deposition of FSP
on wafer-level to minimize power consumption [258,476]. The upper
part of Fig. 16 shows the details of the fabrication processes, as pre-
viously reviewed in literature [9]. An FSP unit was combined with
a water-cooled substrate for synthesis, and a shadow mask was used
in the direct deposition of thick layers of nanoparticles. The
nanoparticles also deposited through the pores of the shadow mask
directly onto micro-hotplates, which were micro-machined on wafers
with a sensitive area of 300 × 300 μm2, Pt-interdigitated elec-
trodes, an embedded heater, and three temperature sensors. During
deposition, the substrate was maintained around 150 °C to ensure
a large thermophoretic deposition rate. Then, the layers were an-
nealed in situ by impinging a particle-free xylene spray flame onto
the shadow mask for 30–60 s to achieve mechanically stable layers.
Further details on the fabrication have been presented in Ref. 258.
It should be pointed out that the particle deposition at the first step
is characterized by a clear “in-flame-agglomeration”-controlled regime
because of the low substrate temperature, while the subsequent in
situ annealing is distinguished by an “on-substrate-sintering” regime
at high flame temperature, where lace-like layers change to compact
cauliflower-like structures with a substantial reduction of SSA. The
separation of the two regimes at different stages of FSP-fabrication
produces novel micro-patterned stable functional inorganic
nanomaterial layers.

A different stabilization method is proposed by Mädler and co-
workers by mechanically laminating the FSP-fabricated highly porous
filter cake into a final dense film at room temperature, leading to
mechanical restructuring and stabilization of the porous layers [143].
An analysis of pore size indicates homogenization of the layers

through rearrangement of the aggregates inside the layers, increas-
ing with applied pressure.

Apart from the thermophoresis-dominated deposition mecha-
nism, an interesting direct impaction deposition mechanism has been
proposed and developed. To control the lateral resolution of the coat-
ings and to achieve mild processing, low contamination, and
compatibility with microfabrication processes, Wegner et al. em-
ployed a supersonic cluster beam deposition system in-line with
an FSP reactor [107]. The lower part of Fig. 16 schematically shows
the details of the FlameBeam apparatus which consists of an FSP
reactor, a critical flow quenching nozzle, an aerodynamic lens focuser,
and a sample holder for substrate raster, all confined within a vacuum
deposition chamber. The FSP-synthesized nanoparticles go through
the quenching nozzle and are focused by aerodynamic lenses into
a beam of ~25 mm diameter onto the substrate. Particles that pass
through the lenses are small with large Stokes number. Therefore,
the traditional thermophoresis-dominated deposition regime in
Section 4.3 shifts into a directed impaction process, similar to ca-
pabilities of high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) processing [273]. The
substrate temperature control system is not needed and coatings
can be deposited on temperature-sensitive materials such as

polymers. Moreover, the final deposited nanoparticles are iso-
lated from volatile species such as water or unburned precursors
that could contaminate the product film.

Another alternative to abating the thermophoresis-dominated
deposition is to precisely control the particle size before deposi-
tion. As mentioned, Maric and co-workers [435–439] have developed
an FSP-based technique, RSDT. Different from traditional FSP de-
position processing, precursors can be heated in a reactor vessel with
temperatures up to 150 °C and pumped with pressures up to 69 bar,
which permits a supercritical solution into the atomizer [435]. This
RSDT ensures a fast solvent vaporization process followed by a direct
gas-to-particle conversion route (instead of droplet-to-particle route),
as shown in Fig. 1. This bottom-up approach helps to realize small
nanoparticle sizes before deposition (e.g. down to 0.5–2 nm of Pt
particles [439]). This small nanoparticle size (around 1–2 nm) leads
to a comparable diffusion flux with respect to thermophoresis, re-
sulting in much denser films than those achieved by traditional FSP-
based deposition. Indeed, this kind of novel processing with ultra-
fine droplets, serving as an improved FSP technique with its
scalability and material adaptability, can also have great potential
when used in the premixed stagnation flame (PSF) system. As a

30

variation of VAFS-based fabrication (Section 5.5), it can now utilize
a variety of low volatility metal precursors and still control their
particle growth at atomic precision.

Moreover, the FSP-fabrication technique is easily scalable. For
example, the capability to operate continuously at atmospheric con-
ditions makes FSP an interesting technique to control the wettability
of surfaces (i.e. paper and board). FSP-synthesized SiO2 film coat-
ings have been reported to provide excellent hydrophilicity, where
the film coating on paper can achieve high production line speeds
up to 150 m/min, with great potential for industrial utilization [477].

6. Diagnostics for nanoparticle synthesis

In the last 20 years, significant advances in diagnostics of com-
bustion aerosol formation have permitted a significant improvement
in understanding physical processes, providing data for testing
models, and remote monitoring and robust controlling in high-
temperature multiphase reaction environments. Here, we summarize
the diagnostic methods in two aspects: (i) intrusive diagnostics based
on sampling, and (ii) on-line in situ diagnostics based on optical and
laser techniques.

6.1. Intrusive diagnostics based on sampling methods

Sampling diagnostics provide detailed information of synthe-
sized nanomaterials, such as morphology and size (by SEM/TEM),
size distribution (by SMPS/DMA), crystallinity (by XRD), surface
morphology (by SEM), and average size (by BET). Compared with
full-scale materials characterization technologies, sampling and col-
lection of nanoparticles from high-temperature aerosol environments
are relatively difficult, as minimizing disturbances requires under-
standing of particle dynamics and their interactions with fluids.
Various in situ and ex situ diagnostic methods in flame synthesis
are summarized in Fig. 17.

Thermophoretic sampling with subsequent TEM analysis (TS-
TEM) is regarded as the most straightforward method, with little

disturbance on the fluid flow field. This method can divulge the
relatively real morphology of as-synthesized particles because the
~101–102 ms residence time of the cold TEM grid in the flame field
ensures the lack of coagulation during the sampling process. More-
over, the thermophoretic velocity of nanoparticles is independent
of particle diameter in the free molecular regime. Primary
nanoparticles of TiO2 [114,341,481,482], SiO2 [341,482], and Al2O3
[345] have been sampled during flame synthesis; and the statisti-
cal averaged particle size is usually treated as accurate for studying
novel laser diagnostics and examining modeling results [337]. Sizes
of agglomerates or aggregates have also been diagnosed by TS-
TEM [241,341,345]. Gröhn et al. [241,483] compared the sizes of
agglomerates measured by TS-TEM and DMA–APM, as exhibited in
Fig. 18. Consistent measurements of primary particles are ob-
tained by TS-TEM and DMA/APM. However, as soon as aggregation
begins, gyration diameters of agglomerates become larger than pro-
jected area equivalents and mobility diameters. As shown in the
inserted plot of Fig. 18, when agglomerates grow from the free-
molecular regime to the continuum region, mobility diameters
gradually exceed projected area equivalent diameters, giving the
upper limit of this sampling method. In general, TS-TEM is an off-
line diagnostic method and can only reflect the integrated result
along the sweep route of the TEM grids. Nonetheless, it interferes
the least with an aerosol process because of small probe size, flow
orientation, and short residence time, ensuring high-certainty result.
For more detailed information like size-distribution, aggregate
number, average primary particle diameter, etc., a well-designed
sampling system is required to extract particles from the high-
temperature flame field and to keep the original morphology of the
nanoparticles. To avoid particle coagulation in the sampling tubes
and diffusion loss to their boundaries, as-synthesized nanoparticles
are diluted significantly during sampling to ensure that the flow time
is much smaller than the collision time of the particles as well as
the diffusion time to the boundary of the sampling tube. Several
typical dilution systems are shown in Fig. 17(a–c). Wang and co-
workers [478] established a dilution sampling system for measuring

et al. [327] for (g) with permissions.)

in Fig. 17(e,d). TEM, SEM, and BET are then used for characteriza-
tion. Measurements from substrates are detailed in the works of Li,
Tse, and co-workers [10,355,356,359], Wang and co-workers
[353,354], Maric and co-workers [436,437], Mädler et al. [256], and
Biswas and co-workers [358]. Water-cooled substrates quench the
coagulation process of nanoparticles and ensure thermophoresis-
dominated deposition, since Peth >> 1 at the inner boundary layer
[10,359]. Nano-devices like sensors or nano-films can be directly
characterized from the deposited materials on the substrates. In in-
dustrial applications, synthesized nanoparticles are usually captured
by filters, as demonstrated in experimental studies of Pratsinis’ group
at the laboratory [43] and industrial levels [103].

6.2. On-line optical measurement

Compared with intrusive sampling, optical measurement espe-
cially laser-based diagnostics provide the capability for robust, non-
intrusive, in situ measurements with both spatial and temporal
precision. Utilization of optical diagnostics for flame synthesis can
be categorized into two main objectives: (i) to provide comprehen-
sive and reliable data of the gas-phase combustion or chemical
reactant (including precursor) field, and (ii) to directly diagnose the
as-synthesized nanomaterials in situ. These two objectives com-
bined will clarify the different sub-processes during flame synthesis,
such as chemical reaction, nucleation, doping, and recrystallization.

6.2.1. In-situ diagnostics of flame field

Table 2 lists optical diagnostic methods that can cover various

parameters of the flame-synthesis flow field.

Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy (SRS) can give a quantitative
measurement of flame temperature with an uncertainty of ±50 K.
SRS can be divided into rotational or vibrational scattering methods,
corresponding to different levels of inelastic scattering between laser
light and molecules. Allendorf et al. [491] studied the influence of
silica nanoparticles on flame structure by using Raman spectros-
copy and suggested N2 as the best choice for Raman measurement.
Our co-workers Liu et al. [490] and Zhang et al. [489] utilized N2
Raman to determine gas-phase temperatures. SRS is self-calibrating
and relatively easy to operate but weak in intensity and not suit-
able for highly luminous particle-laden flames due to interference
[498].

Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) was devel-
oped as an approach to enhance Raman signal levels, in which the
vibrational fingerprints of certain molecules are measured by phase
mixing during the intersection of three laser beams. Bertagnolli and
Lucht [352] used H2 CARS to measure temperature profiles near the
deposition wall in a diamond-forming flame, while Kammler et al.
[295] applied N2 CARS under a single pulse laser pulse to measure
the temperature profile in a premixed flat flame producing TiO2
nanoparticles. By utilizing O2-based pure rotational CARS for tem-
perature measurement, along with laser induced breakdown
detection (LIBD) for droplets and particles, Engel et al. [108] dis-
covered that the energy consumption during particle formation leads
to significantly lower gas temperature with higher particle con-
centration during SiO2 formation from HMDSO in FSP. However, using
N2-based CARS during VAFS of SiO2 from SiCl4, Choi and co-workers
discovered that temperatures decrease in the preheat zone due to
the increase in specific heat of the gas mixture, while tempera-
ture decrease is mitigated in the particle formation zone due to heat
release through hydrolysis and oxidation reactions of SiCl4 [492,493].
CARS can be widely used in flame synthesis with highly radiant back-
grounds. The high precision of temperature measurement of CARS
(<4%) makes it possible to calibrate other techniques. However, CARS
may be complicated in operation, along with requiring sophisti-
cated facilities.

Fig. 18. Comparison of agglomerate measurements between TEM and DMA–APM.
For primary particles (blue filled symbols), the BET-equivalent primary particle size
(squares) is consistent with the aerosol (DMA/APM, circles) and thermophoretic (TEM,
triangles) sampling results. For agglomerates (black open symbols), the mobility di-
ameter from DMA/APM (circles) agrees well with the project area equivalent diameter
from TEM sampling (squares), but differs from the gyration diameter (triangles).

the size distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles by a scanning mobility
particle sizer (SMPS) in which a large flow rate about 29.5 L/min
ensures a large dilution ratio of about 105–7, as exhibited in Fig. 17(a).
Tse and co-workers [356] extended the measurements to low-
pressure by developing a sampling system with an intermediate
aerosol chamber (based on the works of Ober et al. [484] and Whitby
and Hoshino [485]), with three stages of dilution, coupled to com-
mercial nano-SMPS instrument operating at atmospheric pressure.
To enable proper characterization of the nanoparticles, the mea-
sured PSDs were compared with computations from a sectional
model, which considered continued particle growth within the sam-
pling line and the aerosol chamber. Different sampling probe
methods were utilized in studies of Pratsinis and co-workers [479],
Biswas and co-workers [480] and Roth and co-workers [327,486],
as depicted in Fig. 17(b,c,g), respectively. Biswas and co-workers first
extended the measurement of particle size distribution to the sub-
2 nm region by a half mini differential mobility analyzer (Half Mini
DMA) and a Faraday cup electrometer (FCE) [480,487,488]. Parti-
cle mass spectrometry (PMS) was also used as an in situ technique
to follow the evolution of particle size. Roth and co-workers first
used a molecular beam technique and an aerosol particle mass ana-
lyzer (APM) to probe particles in a low pressure flame [327,486],
as depicted in Fig. 17(g). First, charged particles are led to a 10−6 mbar
volume by a nozzle and skimmer, are then classified by an electri-
cal deflection and filter system based on their kinetic energy and
velocity, and are finally detected by a FCE. Pratsinis and co-workers
added a DMA before an APM and obtained quantitative informa-
tion about particle morphology without assumptions of agglomerate
size distribution [479]. In general, intrusive diagnostic methods can
provide in-situ high-resolution data based on the powerful aerosol
analysis instruments, but the measurement uncertainty is usually
limited by the sampling process because (i) the sampling probe may
disturb the local high-temperature aerosol flow field; (ii) the col-
lection efficiency of the sampling system needs to be calibrated with
high accuracy; (iii) the size distribution of nanoaerosol should be
frozen during the sampling process.

For ex situ measurements, synthesized samples can be directly
obtained from stagnation substrates or captured by filters, as shown

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measures tem-
perature from transmission and emission spectra by fitting a
blackbody Planck function to normalized radiance of high-
temperature spectra [41,463,499] (for which the CO2 peak is the most
reliable of the spectra [463]). This approach has been applied to make
temperature measurements in flame spray synthesis of SiO2 [41],
ZrO2 [239], Pt/TiO2 [144], TiO2 [295], and Fe2O3 [175]. It should be
noted that FTIR makes flame temperature measurements as an
average value along the IR beam; and therefore several FTIR mea-
surements need to be taken and then tomographically reconstructed
to map the non-uniform flow [499,500].

Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) possesses the capability to
measure radical species concentration and temperature locally by
tuning a laser to specific wavelengths for absorption by certain mol-
ecules, and then by observing the relatively-intense spontaneous
emission (fluorescence) at red-shifted wavelengths (thereby im-
proving SNR) from excited-energy-state molecules. Hwang et al.
(Choi’s group) [492] employed a PLIF technique to measure rela-
tive profiles of OH concentrations, which decreased significantly in
particle formation zones due to silica generating reactions of SiCl4.
Glumac et al. [494] employed multi-line OH LIF thermometry to di-
agnose the temperature and radical fields in a low pressure H2/O2
flame combined with laser induced scattering which is used for SiO2
synthesis. Tse and co-workers [355] isolated the electrophoretic effect
on nanoparticle size and agglomeration (by manipulating particle
residence times) in electric-field-enhanced flame synthesis by com-
paring LIF of gas-phase temperature and OH concentration with
computational simulations, showing negligible differences between
cases with and without uniform electric field. Kronemayer et al. [495]
and Hecht et al. [496] from Schulz’s group obtained the tempera-
ture field by multi-line NO-LIF thermometry in TiO2 and Fe2O3
formation in VAFS, respectively.

Another aspect of LIF application is to diagnose intermediates
in precursor decomposition/reactions. Different excitation lasers are
used for different kinds of intermediate monomers, as summa-
rized in Table 3. The LIF signals of intermediates like SnO [506], SiO
[502], FeO [503], Fe [496], PbO [504], AlO, and TiO [505] exhibit
similar concentration distributions with a sharp rise in number
density near the burner and a peak in the profile which moves
toward the burner outlet as the precursor concentration increases.
Glumac and co-workers [502,506] further concluded that monox-
ide comes from both the product of precursor decomposition
early in the flame and the partial pressure of solid phase in the
downstream portion of the flame. Muramoto et al. [501] used a
redecomposition LIF (ReD-LIF) to visualize the behavior of Si clusters

synthesized in a laser-induced plasma plume, during which the Si
clusters are first decomposed by a XeCl excimer laser into atoms
and then imaged by 2D-LIF. In general, LIF is useful in probing low-
concentration species in flames (about several ppm Fe in Ref. 496),
but quenching of excited species can restrict its quantitative mea-
surement of species.

Compared with laser-based techniques, optical emission spec-
troscopy (OES) is qualitative in measuring gas-phase species
concentrations, but is more amenable for operation in industrial en-
vironments, needing only spectrometers or filter lenses. Apart from
the intense emission bands from radicals such as OH*, CH*, and C2*
[507], emissions of intermediates in precursor reactions, like SiO
(220–265 nm) and Si (around 252 nm) in flame synthesis of SiO2,
have also been detected [508]. Moreover, OES is a line-of-sight tech-
nique which has limitations in spatial resolution.

6.2.2. In-situ laser-based diagnostics of nanoparticles

Besides gas-phase diagnosis of the flame synthesis field, non-
intrusive in situ laser-based diagnostics of the as-synthesized
materials are needed for understanding, modeling, monitoring, and
controlling the synthesis process. Table 4 lists various methods of
laser diagnoses of particles during flame synthesis. Diagnostics of
the particle phase are based on interactions between laser and par-
ticle matter, and the interactions at various levels reflect certain
information about the particles. Elastic scattering (or laser-induced
scattering) of particles can indicate particle size, and inelastic scat-
tering (or Raman) can give information about the crystallinity. For

higher laser energies, laser-induced incandescence (LII) can irra-
diate particles thermally, determining the number density and size
of the particles, using certain absorption and radiation models. When
the photons of the laser are energetic enough to excite the elec-
trons up to the conduction band of the particles, atomic emission
of phase-selective laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (PS-
LIBS) is useful in detecting gas-to-particle conversion and bandgap
variation processes of certain compositions, along with determin-
ing volume fractions of as-synthesized nanoparticles. Finally, when
the laser power is strong enough to breakdown all material to
plasma, elements of both gas and particles phases can be quanti-
fied by conventional laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).
We summarize these laser-particle interaction mechanisms in Fig. 22,
and discuss them subsequently.

6.2.2.1. Laser and X-ray induced scattering (LIS). Laser-induced scat-
tering (LIS) can be divided into two regimes: Rayleigh scattering
(dp << λ) and Mie scattering. Most LIS scattering experiments are con-
ducted in the Rayleigh regime, due to the relatively simple scattering
rules compared with the Mie scattering theory for optical light.

In the Rayleigh scattering regime, the scattered light is propor-
tional to the average square of particle volume and the number
density of particles. If the system is a pure coagulation, that is, the
particle volume fraction (and thus the volume of particle times the
number density) is constant, the scattered signal is then approxi-
mately proportional to particle volume, which is called the Tyndall
effect in the aerosol measurement field [519]. Graham and Horner
[520] measured the time-resolved particle diameter in a coagula-
tion system. Yang and Biswas [509] used Rayleigh scattering of
particles to evaluate characteristic sintering time. However, most
Rayleigh scattering measurements can only be viewed as qualita-
tive because of the invalid Rayleigh–Debye–Gans approximation,
which assumes that particles behave like point sources of reradi-
ated waves, with no reflection and internal particle refraction.
Moreover, the scattered light is affected due to light extinction
through the flame, and therefore additional information by other
techniques is necessary for calibration, limiting quantitative LIS. If
we expand our consideration into Mie scattering, which can be used
to measure the size distribution function of micro-sized droplets
or sub-micro particles in FSP, then multi-wavelength light sources
[521,522] or multiple scattering angles [345,523] are needed to
obtain more data of the aerosols because the scattering kernel is
not a simple function of particle size. Ma systematically discussed

the mathematical consideration of solving the aerosol size distri-
bution from the Fredholm integral equations [524].

Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) can successfully overcome
the above limitations in scattering of optical light because x-ray fre-
quencies are too high (three magnitudes higher than optical
frequency) for most electronic responses which makes the refrac-
tive index for x-rays nearly unity. Therefore, without considering
wave velocities and boundary conditions, X-ray scattering is simply
a wave problem [525]. After solving the technique problem of small
fluxes, SAXS is extended from an ex situ diagnostic [526,527] to in
situ diagnostic [293,497,510]. Beaucage et al. [510] first applied SAXS
using synchrotron radiation in studying SiO2 nanoparticle growth
in flames. Camenzind et al. [497] utilized SAXS for monitoring
primary particle size, volume fraction, aggregate gyration radius,
and mass fractal dimension with good spatial resolutions. Briefly,
Porod’s law, I(q) = Bq−4, is observed in high-q regions, where q is the
scattering wave vector defined as (4π/λ)sin(θ/2); λ is the wave-
length of the incident beam; θ is the scattering angle; and B is a
constant proportional to the average surface to volume ratio for the
nanoparticles. The average spherical diameter can therefore be de-
termined by dp = 6V/S. The deviation from Porod’s law at low q regions
can give Rg, the radius of gyration of the primary particles, using
Guinier’s law, I(q) = G·exp(−q2Rg
2/3), where G is a constant propor-
tional to the number density and average squared volume of the
nanoparticles. Combining Porod’s and Guinier’s regimes, ratios
between B and G can be utilized in charactering the polydisper-
sity of the particles, i.e., fractal number and aggregate size.

Apart from static scattering methods, dynamic light scattering
can also measure in situ particle sizes. In dynamic light scattering,
particles with Brownian motion will give rise to fluctuations in the
scattering field which can be correlated to the mean speed or al-
ternatively the particle diffusion coefficient. The particle diffusion
coefficient can then be related to a mean particle diameter. Zachariah
et al. [338] measured the size of silica particles by dynamic light
scattering in a counterflow diffusion flame. However, it was shown
that the dynamic light scattering technique degrades rapidly as the
signal strength declines.

Moreover, if we consider micro-sized droplets in spray flames,
phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) can also provide information on
droplet size and flow flux by measuring light-induced scattering or
reflection from droplets. The phase difference of the scattered light
from droplets in the intersection region of two laser beams can be
related to the size and velocity of droplets. Pratsinis’ group temporally

34

S.Q. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 1–59

measured the size and velocity of droplets in FSP [239,511], which
exhibited good agreement with modeling results. PDA is re-
stricted to spherical micro-sized particles and therefore has
difficulties in extending to nanoparticles owing to the weak signal
and aggregate morphologies.

6.2.2.2. Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is a technique that
can identify nanoparticle composition and crystallinity during flame
synthesis. However, the inherently weak Raman effects generally
limits the diagnostics to ex situ measurement on nanoparticles [528].
In addition, size confinement, temperature, and oxygen stoichiom-
etry may influence the peak width and wavenumber shift for
nanoparticles. In some work, Raman scattering is used to charac-
terize the nanoparticle size, but other factors like anharmonicity,
lattice parameter variation, and local electric field slightly influ-
ence the observed Raman shifts. In situ Raman diagnosis of
nanoparticle aerosol formation during flame synthesis was first per-
formed by Liu et al. [490] for characterizing TiO2, revealing phase
transitions from amorphous to anatase to rutile. In general, it is be-
lieved that the use of in situ Raman scattering for the composition
of crystalline nanomaterials needs more investigation.

6.2.2.3. Laser induced incandescence (LII). Laser induced incandes-
cence (LII), a technique originally developed for soot diagnostics in
combustion, takes advantage of the thermal effect of laser heating
to bring particles to thousands of Kelvins in several nanoseconds
and then to detect spatial and temporal near-blackbody emission
from them [512,529]. The absolute radiation intensity is related to
the volume fraction of particles, while the signal decay with time
correlates to the particle size. Numerical models for energy and mass
balance of particles are extremely important in determining
particle size because of the complicated heat- and mass-loss mecha-
nisms involved, such as conduction, radiation, and sublimation. These
mechanisms involve important parameters, such as refractive-
index function E(m) and thermal and mass accommodation
coefficients [530]. In extending LII investigation from near-blackbody
soot to non-carbonaceous nanoparticles, in situ information of par-
ticle size can be accomplished, but there are two main challenges
that need to be overcome: (i) new and different emission modes
from irradiations due to electronically-excited gas-phase species from
particles; and (ii) difficulty in modeling due to complicated absorp-
tion, emission, and accommodation coefficients of general particles.
Size distribution determination from LII signals, such as those
on Ag and TiN [531], and Fe [532], depends heavily on the thermal
balance model of particles, e.g. laser energy absorption by par-
ticles in the Rayleigh regime under gray-body assumption. The model
proposed by Filippov et al. [531] considers convective heat trans-
fer and material vaporization to/from the surroundings, but neglects
thermal radiation in the thermal and mass balance equation of par-
ticles. Incandescence intensity correlates to particle size distribution
via the solution of a Fredholm integral equation or by simply fitting
parameters of certain size distributions. However, excessive as-
sumptions and simplification of the LII models lead to discrepancies
with TEM/DMA sampling. Eremen’s work further indicated that the
thermal accommodation factors are influenced by particle size
[533,534] and bath gas [535], exposing that calibration work is ex-
tremely important for quantitative LII measurements. Lehre et al.
[514] utilized two-color LII to obtain the temperature of particles,
successfully reducing the uncertainties in the model. Cignoli et al.
[513] utilized UV-light excitation in LII during flame synthesis of
TiO2 to ensure the efficiency of absorption by the anatase lattice.
On the other hand, LII spectroscopy on metal particles of W, Fe,
Mo, Ti [536], and Mo [537], along with metal-oxide particles of TiO2
[515], all display obvious atomic emission of metal atoms super-
imposed on thermal irradiation of particles under high laser intensity.
Electronic excitation from vaporization of particles [536] and laser

induced emission from atoms in particles may cause misleading in-
terpretations of LII signals, which may not correlate with the size
or volume fraction of particles. In LII, the laser intensity in the probe
volume needs to be controlled to ensure that the emission is pure
incandescence from irradiation of the particles. Serendipitously, the
unwanted atomic emission observed during LII experiments may
reveal a novel phase-selective laser induced breakdown spectros-
copy (PS-LIBS) regime.

6.2.2.4. Phase-selective laser induced breakdown spectroscopy. As a
novel laser diagnostic method developed under a collaboration
between Li’s lab at Tsinghua University and Tse’s lab at Rutgers
University, phase-selective laser induced breakdown spectrosco-
py (PS-LIBS) has shown the ability to be a diagnostic for gas-to-
particle conversion [302,489], volume fraction measurement [337],
and bandgap variation in mixed crystal structures [301]. Briefly,
nanoparticles are selectively broken down into plasma, with no gas-
phase breakdown because of the different thresholds between gas
and particle phase, such that atomic spectroscopy can be made of
only atoms originating from the particulate phase. Therefore, it can
be applied to examine the gas-to-particle conversion process in flame
aerosol synthesis [301,302,337], as well as sodium release during
coal combustion [332]. When PS-LIBS signals reach saturation with
laser intensity, the signal intensity is linear with volume fraction
of particles, enabling quantitative measurement of volume frac-
tion [337]. Two-dimensional imaging of particulate matter is further
achieved [302,337], as seen in Fig. 19. Clearly, we can see a gas-to-
particle conversion across the Bunsen laminar flame sheet, and the
saturated signal intensity downstream reflects the conservative
volume fraction during the collision–coalescence processes. More-
over, this map of atomic titanium emission perfectly images the
gradient caused by diffusion and thermophoresis of nanoparticles,
indicating that PS-LIBS can be used in studying fundamental trans-
port properties of nanoparticles in an aerosol system.

Physically, PS-LIBS is believed to be caused by an absorption–
ablation–excitation mechanism, which was recently clarified by Li
and co-workers [303]. Rayleigh scattering measurements and further
time scale analyses of the non-dimensional Fokker–Planck equa-
tion indicate that atomic emissions originate from an ablation process
caused by laser absorption of conduction band electrons from one-
photon or multi-photon ionization. Hence the signal intensity is
sensitive to the variation of bandgap of particles, which is helpful
in detecting the bandgap change during synthesis of mixed-
composition nanoparticles, e.g. V2O5—TiO2 composite and other
bandgap narrowing compositions in photocatalytic materials [336].
As shown in Fig. 20, adding vanadium significantly enhances the oc-
currence of atomic emission of titanium, especially at the initial stage
of synthesis. This phenomenon is caused by the fact that the bandgap
of V-doped TiO2 particles (2.3 eV) is smaller than that of pure TiO2

particles produces a spectrum with atomic emission superim-
posed upon non-zero incandescence spectra. Incandescence radiation
of material is believed to occur more easily when electrons are dif-
ficult to be excited in materials with high bandgap energy or non-
metal materials like soot and Si [516]. When the laser intensity is
high enough to breakdown all the matter (i.e. gas and solid) in the
detection volume, conventional laser induced breakdown spectros-
copy (LIBS) is achieved above a critical breakdown threshold, which
can be used to detect the absolute elemental concentration after
calibration. Amodeo et al. presented conventional LIBS measure-
ment of SiO2 after guiding the aerosol to a certain volume [517],
while Engle et al. used LIBS for detecting the existence of particles
[108]. However, to our best knowledge, little conventional LIBS has
been utilized in in situ on-line diagnosis of flame synthesis with
spatial resolution because the strong breakdown process wipes away
all information at the molecular level; and the millimeter-sized high-
temperature plasma significantly disturbs the reaction process and
synthesis products. In contrast to conventional LIBS, PS-LIBS ex-
hibits a promising prospect of in situ on-line diagnostics of flame
synthesis, in particular, for meeting the needs of complex doping
synthesis of mixed oxide nanomaterials.

7. Theory and modeling

Because of the multi-scale characteristics on coupling trans-
port phenomena (convection, diffusion, thermophoresis, and
condensation), reaction kinetics, nucleation, and aerosol coagula-
tion dynamics in flame synthesis, the theoretical framework for
modeling and simulating poly-disperse nanoparticles comprises
several models at different time and length scales, as schematical-
ly shown in Fig. 22. At the macroscopic continuum level, the
population balance model (PBM) describes the evolution of the size
distribution of nanoparticles during flame synthesis, which couples
temperature, fluid velocity field, and species information (from CFD
models) with reaction rates (from chemical kinetics models). Mo-
lecular dynamics (MD) simulation can further physically detail the
parameters of collision and coalescence, and reactive MD simula-
tion can provide information on heterogeneous reaction mechanisms,
both of which can then be used in the continuum models.

7.1. Time-scale analysis of flame synthesis process

Before solving PBM coupled with both fluid dynamics and
chemical reactions, time-scale analysis is a simple and fast ap-
proach to determine some of the most important physical factors,
as well as estimating the final size of the nanoparticles, including
multicomponent and doped ones. Here, time-scale analysis, i.e.,

(3.2 eV). The larger signal intensity indicates that the bandgap vari-
ation of TiO2 starts at the burner outlet and therefore PS-LIBS is able
to indicate when and where the bandgap variation begins, which
is of great importance in designing the flame field for synthesiz-
ing nanoparticles with mixed components.

PS-LIBS is distinguished from other laser-based diagnostics by
its different mechanisms of laser–matter interaction, as dia-
gramed in Fig. 21, with different laser diagnostic processes marked
in their regimes. When the laser intensity is relatively low
(<10−4 GW/cm2), elastic or inelastic scattering is the dominant mech-
anism, corresponding to laser induced scattering (LIS) and Raman,
respectively. At higher laser intensity beyond a critical threshold,
particles are ablated. Notably, the ablation threshold is influenced
by the photon energy and the bandgap of the particle. When the
photon energy is not high enough to excite the electrons, higher laser
intensity is needed to ensure the possibility of multi-photon exci-
tation. The atomic emission of Ti has been observed for UV [513,515]
laser irradiation of titania at less than 10−2 GW/cm2, while the thresh-
old rises to 10−1 GW/cm2 at 532 nm wavelength and 1 GW/cm2 at
1064 nm wavelength. If the bandgap of the particle greatly exceeds
the photon energy, the particle is only heated by the laser irradi-
ation and no plasma forms, with the process situated in the LII
regime. In the study of Mo particles by LII using 1064 nm laser
excitation [537], the combination of irradiation and ablation of

based diagnostic methods, as demonstrated by the area enclosed by the excitation,
ablation and breakdown threshold dashed lines.

7.2. Continuum level approach: population balance modes

7.2.1. Basic PBM approach

The population balance model (PBM) describes the population
development of a system, and has been widely used in areas such
as aerosol science, materials science, and cell biology [543]. Par-
ticularly in flame synthesis, the model defines the time derivative
of particle concentration, in consideration of the birth and death
(production and destruction) of new particles. Here, the basic equa-
tion is known as the aerosol general dynamic equation (GDE).
Generally, it involves gas-to-particle conversion (nucleation), co-
agulation, and surface growth (condensation of monomers/surface
reactions), and is given by:

where k refers to the number of atoms/molecules in the particle.
Classical homogenous nucleation theory is the simplest way to
describe the nucleation process in Eqn. (7.1). Accordingly, homog-
enous nucleation occurs when a particle reaches a critical size,
containing k* atoms/molecules. Thus, the nucleation term gener-
ally has the form as given in Eqns. (7.2) and (7.3) [544]:

In the above equations, A* and w* are the kinetic pre-factor and
the work for forming a critical particle, respectively; σ is surface
tension; v0 is the atomic or molecular volume; and Δg is the Gibbs
free energy per unit volume.

The coagulation term in Eqn. (7.1) can be derived from Brown-
ian collision between particles, for which the governing equation
is known as the Smoluchowski equation [545]

The third term of Eqn. (7.1) is due to the condensation of mono-
mers onto the particles and the evaporation of the monomers from
the particles. Similar to the coagulation term, the surface term can
be further expressed as:

Some special numerical approaches have been developed to solve
the GDE equations to obtain the particle size distribution, as the
equations are both nonlinear and partial integro-differential. These
approaches include sectional methods with discretization and local
approximation [547,548], moment based methods that can trans-
form the equations into ordinary differential equations [549,550],

calculation of characteristic times, is useful in gaining understand-
ing of the whole flame synthesis system, and further in decoupling
the multi-scale processes such as chemical reaction, Brownian co-
agulation, and sintering [10,21,137,359,361].

A typical time-scale analysis of flame synthesis in a premixed
stagnation burner (as discussed in Section 2.5) is illustrated in Fig. 23.
First, the chemical reaction time is calculated based on the kinetic
parameters of the reactions. As an example, for TTIP–TiO2 conver-
sion, hydrolysis reaction contributes the most to the production of
TiO2 monomers, given the OH-rich premixed flame. With the main
reaction identified, the initial condition of PBM can be largely sim-
plified. The ensuing nucleation process is usually omitted in the
analysis because classical nucleation theory calculates the critical
cluster size to be smaller than the dimension of a single monomer
[22,538]. However, some investigators have argued that the ho-
mogenous nucleation rate is overestimated by classical nucleation
theory [539].

The characteristic times of Brownian coagulation and sintering
(also correspondingly termed collision and coalescence) are gen-
erally calculated to predict the final morphology of particles. When
coagulation time is larger than sintering time, there is enough time
for the primary particles to merge into a new particle before each
collision. If sintering time is larger than coagulation time, there will
not be enough time for complete sintering of the particles, and ag-
gregates and agglomerates will form [137]. The characteristic time
of collision can be calculated from the collision frequency, β. Gen-
erally, the free molecule assumption for low Kn number is adequate
for flame-synthesized nanoparticles. Some results also imply that
the sticking coefficient may be smaller than that predicted by stan-
dard kinetic theory at relatively low temperatures [540]. For the
calculation of characteristic time of sintering, several empirical for-
mulas can be found in the literature [19,292,541]. Nonetheless,
sintering is very sensitive to temperature and particle size. None-
theless, if the flow time is well-selected, the coagulation process
can be affected to control nanoparticle morphology and size.

In terms of flame synthesis of multi-element nano-products,
studies have found a variety of morphologies under different species
and flame environments [27,292]. So far, it is still difficult for PBM
to describe the detailed interactions between different species in
flames. In pioneering work by Zachariah and Dimitriou [542], they
numerically calculated the characteristic time for scavenging in the
SiO2—TiO2 system. Recently, Li and co-workers [137,361] ex-
tended the time-scale analysis to the Pd-TiO2 supported catalyst
system, showing effective deposition of Pd on the support surface,
which in turn suppressed further growth of the Pd catalyst particles.

and Monte Carlo methods [551,552]. A comprehensive descrip-
tion and comparison of different methods can be found in a previous
PECS review [553]. For easy use and for certain applications,
Zachariah’s group released a non-commercial GDE software package
named NGDE, which is available for solving nucleation, surface
growth, and coagulation problems [554,555].

7.2.2. PBM coupled with fluid field

Flame synthesis is generally featured as a one-step direct syn-
thesis method, and the growth of the particles in a flame is therefore
determined by the local fluid field. The residence time of particles
in a flame, for example, can be as short as 5 ms in a premixed stag-
nation swirl flame (SSF) [128,137]. Also, the temperature profile
undergoes dramatic change from ambient temperature to flame tem-
perature. Therefore, the local fluid field will influence both physical
and chemical processes involved in precursor reaction and parti-
cle growth, necessitating an update to the basic population balance
model.

In a laminar flame environment, PBM coupled with fluid dy-
namics equations can still be solved by sectional or moment based
methods, especially for nano-scale particles that should follow well
the streamlines of the flow field. However, in turbulent flows, the
problem is complex, due to the chaotic nature to be modeled [553].
The combination of moment based methods and CFD codes (LES/
DNS) is the common approach to attack the problem, with certain
assumptions and approximations, as shown in the early works by
Pratsinis and co-workers [556,557]. In their comparisons, mono-
disperse and one-dimensional models were found to show
satisfactory results in simple systems [557]. A Gaussian quadrature-
based moment method (QMOM) was developed by Rosner and co-
workers [288,558,559]. It is a multivariate population balance model,
based on Koch and Friedlander’s bivariate model [560]. The moment
method with interpolative closure (MoMIC), introduced from soot
modeling, was also developed in these years [561]. For turbulent
flames, a conditional quadrature method of moments (CQMOM) was
proposed by Fox’s group to predict the TiO2 particle growth [562].
An overview of the latest development of PBM in turbulent flames
can be found in their recent literature [563].

7.2.3. PBM coupled with chemical reaction

Along with the fluid field, kinetic reactions of the precursors should
also be considered by the population balance models to describe
properly particle growth in flame synthesis. These high tempera-
ture chemical reactions initiate the production of monomers, followed
by particle nucleation and growth. Several typical precursor reac-
tions are listed in Table 5. The precursor chemistry mainly involves
pyrolysis, hydrolysis, and surface reactions. Taking TTIP–TiO2 con-
version as an example, the decomposition/pyrolysis of TTIP, which
has a large activation energy, is thermal-driven, while hydrolysis of
TTIP, characterized by small activation energy, is radical-driven and

often occurs in OH-rich flames. Fig. 24(a and b) shows the station-
ary points on the potential energy surface corresponding to the
hydrolysis and thermal decomposition of TTIP and the main reac-
tion route of TTIP hydrolysis. The activation energy barrier of TTIP
hydrolysis is estimated to be ~10 kcal/mol, while the barriers of
thermal decomposition are much higher (85–87 kcal/mol) [570].
Based on the above quantum chemical computations and experi-
mental data of Ti-containing intermediate concentrations in H2/Ar
flame, Shmakov et al. [570] proposed the scheme of TTIP hydroly-
sis as presented in Fig. 24(c). Therefore, radical-driven hydrolysis is
the fastest reaction and usually dominates the precursor reaction
of TTIP. Moreover, radical-driven reactions usually start in the pre-
heat zone upstream of the flame reaction zone, while thermal-
driven reaction usually occurs in the reaction or post-flame zone,
being highly dependent on temperature.

With increasing computational power and knowledge from
quantum chemistry, researchers have started to adopt detailed chem-
ical kinetic mechanisms combined with PBM. Menz and Kraft [571]
employed an 8-step gas-phase mechanism with 6 heterogeneous
reactions to simulate flame synthesis of silicon nanoparticles. De-
tailed chemistry in flame synthesis modeling still stands as a
challenging topic, as many reactions are multi-phase, and the re-
action parameters are difficult to determine.

7.3. Atomic level approach: molecular dynamic simulation

Atomic-level molecular dynamic simulation has been widely at-
tempted to quantitatively characterize the collision–coalescence and
other physical/chemical processes of nanoparticles, like heteroge-
neous catalytic reaction of functional nanoparticles. In this work,
the collision and coalescence of two approaching nanoparticles are
intensively reviewed as follows.

7.3.1. MD simulations of nanoparticle collision/coagulation

For example, the effect of long-range interactions on particle
collision time is a long-existing problem in aerosol science. When
the interaction between particles is on the order of the particle
radius or longer, coagulation rates between particles are en-
hanced by increasing the capture radius of individual particles
[572–576] and aggregates [577]. An enhancement factor Wenh was
proposed by Fuchs [578] to account for long-range interaction for
the collision kernel, i.e.

β

= Wenh 0
β

(7.7)

where β is the collision kernel including the effects of long-range
interaction; and β0 is that only for Brownian coagulation given in
Eqn. (7.5). Ouyang et al. reviewed a variety of expressions for the
enhancement factor for both continuum and free-molecular regimes,
for both charged and neutral particles [579]. Apart from these two

types of long-range interactions, dipole–dipole interaction on en-
hancing the collision kernel should not be ignored, as nanoparticles
can have permanent dipoles due to asymmetry of the crystalline
structure or asymmetrical distribution of ions at their surface. These
dipoles have been verified by experiments on CdSe [580] and ZnSe
[581] and more recently by MD simulation on TiO2 [582].

Initially, Li and co-workers [582] compared van der Waals (vdW)
and dipole–dipole forces between two TiO2 nanoparticles using MD,
as shown in Fig. 25(a). The attractive dipole–dipole force is much
larger than the vdW force by several orders of magnitude at long
distance. Thermal fluctuations of surface ions, especially at high tem-
peratures, can lead to increasing fluctuation of the instantaneous

dipole direction and finally to a decrease in magnitude of the time-
averaged dipole moment. They further applied MD to quantify the
role of dipole–dipole interaction by calculating the enhancement
factor Wenh during the Brownian collision of two neutral TiO2
nanoparticles in the free molecular regime [583]. Critical capture
radii rf were examined at four characteristic dipole-moment
directions/orientations. As shown in Fig. 25(b), dipole–dipole in-
teractions significantly augment the enhancement factor compared
with vdW interactions. As the temperature increases, the enhance-
ment factors regress to the values of vdW interactions because of
the reduction of the particle dipole moments as a result of thermal
fluctuations.

7.3.2. MD simulations of nanoparticle sintering

Upon collision of two particles, sintering (or coalescence) domi-
nates the growth of the ‘merged’ particle and is responsible for
determining its final morphology and dimensions. In physics, sin-
tering of nanoparticles is a thermal process that involves mass
transport of atoms at the nanoscale. Thus MD simulation is fre-
quently applied to investigate the mass transport routes of sintering.
Usually, classic sintering theory of micro-sized ceramic particles
cannot be extended to nanoparticles because several different fea-
tures exist during sintering at the nanoscale.

First, a high portion of surface atoms comprising the nanoparticles
change the melting point and lead to size-dependent crystalline-
core-amorphous-shell structures of nanoparticles. Various statistical
values from MD simulation have been proposed to describe struc-
tures and properties of nanoparticles, as summarized in Table 6.
Potential energy and Lindemann index have been used to de-
scribe the crystallization state of nanoparticles. As presented in
Fig. 26, critical diameters for the phase transition of grain struc-
tures for different temperatures are predicted by MD. At small
particle diameters, the melting point depends not only on the particle

temperature (like for bulk material) but also on the particle size.
From a thermodynamic consideration, an inverse linear relation-
ship between the difference in temperature and the particle diameter
has been proposed, i.e.,

(

) ∝

(7.8)

where Tm0 and Tmp are the melting temperatures of the bulk mate-
rial and the nanoparticle, respectively; and dp is the particle diameter.
Moreover, the average coordination number [585] and local lattice
orientation [584] reveal that an amorphous shell of 0.4–0.6 nm sur-
rounds a crystalline core, as visualized in Fig. 26(a). Such a crystalline-
core-amorphous-shell structure exists due to the highly distorted
surface of the nanoparticles. When the nanoparticle size is smaller
than a critical diameter, the influence of the amorphous shell pen-
etrates the entire particle, forming a different amorphous grain
structure, as illustrated in Fig. 26(b). The critical transition diam-
eters from amorphous to crystalline-core-amorphous-shell structures
for TiO2 nanoparticles at different temperatures are shown by the
red circles of Fig. 26, based on MD results. As such, different size-
dependent structures of nanoparticles can lead to different
coalescence processes; and nucleation or recrystallization may be
involved during the growth of nanoparticles, which is signifi-
cantly different from that for conventional sintering.

Second, different sintering mechanisms dominate for different
kinds of nanoparticles. Surface diffusion and grain boundary dif-
fusion were observed to be the main mass transport routes for
particles with crystal structures, while viscous diffusion was dom-
inant for amorphous particles. In the MD studies, several statistical
values like surface area, gyration radius, ratio of moment of inertia,
and shrinkage have been proposed to directly characterize the co-
alescence of the two nanoparticles into a single larger one. A typical
sintering process between two 3 nm crystalline-core-amorphous-
shell nanoparticles at 1573 K is characterized by temperature and
normalized surface area, as shown in Fig. 27. The coalescence (sin-
tering) process can be divided into four stages: (i) before contacting,
the two particles rotate with a small angle to adjust their lattice
planes (shown in snapshots A and B and regarded as the oriented
attachment mechanism, which has also been discovered in the sin-
tering processes of Au [586,587] and Cu [588] particles); (ii) a
sintering neck forms between two particles and grows rapidly, ac-
companied by rapid surface reduction and temperature increase
(shown in snapshot C), which is controlled by surface diffusion; (iii)
a grain boundary forms at the center of the two crystal cores, with

further surface reduction (shown in snapshot D), which is con-
trolled by both grain boundary diffusion and surface diffusion; and
finally (iv) the particle shape transforms from ellipsoid to sphere.
The sintering process between two amorphous particles is rela-
tively simple, as its coalescence behaves similar to a fusion process
between liquid droplets, controlled mainly by viscous diffusion. It
should be noted that in all sintering processes, the high ratio of
surface energy to total energy results in non-negligible heat release
and temperature rise (with positive feedback) during sintering [589].

In the phenomenological Koch–Friedlander model,

−(

(7.9)

where a is the surface area during sintering; af is the surface area
after final coalescence; and τ is the characteristic sintering time. The
aforementioned complicated mechanisms present difficulties in de-
riving a theoretical sintering time, except for some typical cases like
the viscous-controlled sintering time of amorphous particles, which
can be expressed as τ = ηdp/σ [590] or the solid-state sintering time,
which can be expressed by τ = 3kbTvp/(64σDvm) [591]. Molecular sim-
ulation then provides an empirical equation after fitting the surface
variation line.

Third, sintering can induce nucleation and recrystallization of
nanoparticles. In MD simulation, Li and co-workers discovered a
unique phase in the sintering of two 3 nm anatase nanoparticles
[584], and Korparde et al. detected phase transformation in multi-
particle sintering with multiple phases [592]. Thermodynamically,
the free energy of a particle at nanoscale is not only dependent on
temperature but on particle size as well. Naicker et al. [593] and
Zhang et al. [594] quantified the effect of surface energy on the sta-
bility of TiO2 nanoparticles. Phase transition may occur when particle
size increases during sintering. For example, for TiO2 particles, anatase
phase is less stable than rutile phase for larger particles [481,595];
and amorphous particles may transform into crystalline-core-
amorphous-shell nanoparticles during particle growth. Therefore,
compared with the geometrical change at the last stage, crystal struc-
ture change can lead to significant temperature increase as shown
in Fig. 27. Zhou and Fichthorn used MD simulations to probe ki-
netics of the transformation in individual anatase nanocrystals as
well as in nanocrystal aggregates [596]. However, the details of
sintering-induced phase transition in physics is still unclear in terms
of whether sintering facilitates recrystallization and nucleation ki-
netically. Further investigation, particularly for phase transition of
mixed metal oxides, is needed.

Different from collision–coalescence of nanoparticles in flame
synthesis, sintering or thermal deactivation of catalyst supported
immobile nanoparticles can be attributed to Ostwald ripening
[597,598], which involves inter-particle transport of mobile species
with larger particles growing at the expense of smaller particles
due to differences in surface energy. Ostwald ripening is a near-
equilibrium process of aging, redistribution, or coarsening of matter
in various areas [599,600]. It usually takes several hours to tran-
spire for immobile solid particles, and thus its characterization is
beyond the current ability of MD simulations. Ostwald ripening in
this area has only been investigated by MD simulation in cases of
liquid argon clusters in the high-pressure vapor phase [600].

7.4. Mesoscopic approach: Lagrangian particle method

Between the scales of Eulerian continuum approach and La-
grangian MD simulations, a mesoscopic approach lies in the
description of flame aerosol system at the “discrete” particle level.
The PBM-based continuum approach cannot describe the evolu-
tion of morphologies and structures of particle agglomerates or
aggregates, whereas the MD simulations can do so but are con-
strained by the number of primary particles due to huge
computational expense. Discrete-element method (DEM), as one of
the typical Lagrangian particle methods sharing similar method-
ology with MD but fixed at the particle level, is suitable for direct
descriptions of nanoscale particle dynamics. The well-developed DEM
framework for micro-sized particles or bulk grains, which is inte-
grated with CFD of both electric and flow fields, entirely incorporates
particle–particle interactions, particle–particle fluid interactions and
particle–particle electric interactions [601], DEM for nanoscale par-
ticles only began in recent years, and a tentative review on nanoscale
dynamics can be found in the literature [602]. As for soft-
agglomerates in which the aforementioned van der Waals forces
dominate interparticle interactions in the near-contact zone (i.e.,
short-range), the accuracy of the continuum models, based on classic
adhesive contact theory, is validated by several researchers using
MD to simulate the atomic interactions in nanoparticle collision prob-
lems [603,604,611]. The MD simulation results for the normal contact
forces are compared to continuum theory predictions obtained by
the Maugis–Dugdale, JKR (Johnson–Kendall–Roberts), and DMT
(Derjaguin–Muller– Toporov) adhesive contact models. The Maguis–
Dugdale model exhibits excellent agreement with MD results for
‘large’ nanoparticles (>20 nm) [604], while the DMT model obtains
reasonable agreement for ‘small’ nanoparticles, in a range of 1.95–
8.24 nm [611]. Considering a normal force model similar to the DMT
model as well as the related frictional and dissipation forces models
(as seen in detail in [601]), a time-driven, soft sphere DEM was de-
veloped by Higashitani et al. [605] and Eggersdorfer et al. [606] for
simulation of the restructuring and fragmentation of soft-
agglomerates of nanoparticles under a shear flow. A much simpler
event-driven, hard sphere DEM was applied by the same investi-
gators to describe the growth and structure of particles undergoing
agglomeration/coagulation (in absence of coalescence/sintering) in
both the free molecular and the continuum regimes by combining
with Langevin dynamics method [607]. For hard aggregates in which
the strong sintering bonds dominate the short-range interactions
between particles, the event-driven DEM has also been developed
to incorporate the sintering rate laws of various regimes including
viscous-flow, lattice diffusion, and grain boundary diffusion [608].
Nevertheless, a hysteric sintering contact model that was pro-
posed by Luding can be referred to constitute the time-driven DEM
simulations on the reconstructing of particle aggregates [609]. Gen-
erally speaking, time-driven, soft-sphere DEM is still neither well
defined for describing the dynamics of contacting nanoparticles along
both normal and tangential directions, nor convincingly validated

by the experiments, including its complex coupling, across several
orders of different time scales, with the CFD simulation for fluids.

8. Conclusions and future directions

Flame synthesis, in the past two decades, has not only proven
to be one of the most scalable and economical technologies for pro-
ducing well-controlled oxide nanostructured materials (covering
most elements in the periodic table), but also been demonstrated
to be a robust fabrication method of functional thin films and
nano-devices.

The various burner types, with vapor-fed or liquid-fed precur-
sors, are summarized and compared. The co-flow jet burner had been
widely used for large-scale commercial production, whereas flat
flame burners, either Hencken (multi-element diffusion) or McKenna
(premixed), are excellent tools for performing fundamental studies
because of their uniform temperature and flow fields. More re-
cently, the flame spray pyrolysis burner has shown its advantage
for producing nanomaterials nearly covering all elements in the pe-
riodic table, along with facile doping of two or three elements during
synthesis. The premixed stagnation burner with a temperature-
controlled substrate is suitable for precisely producing ultrafine
nanoparticles with atomic accuracy as well as fabricating various
kinds of functional thin-films, i.e., granular, columnar, and mixed
ones by controlling time scales of key sub-processes.

The progress on doping synthesis of mixed metal-oxide
nanocatalysts, photocatalysts, sensing nanomaterials, and
nanophosphors are reviewed from a point of view of morpholog-
ical structures of nanocomposites. A diagram for the doping synthesis
of these nanocomposites with desired structures, i.e., heteroge-
neously supported structure, homogeneously crystalline structure,
and crystalline-core-amorphous-shell structure, is presented. Four
key factors, including temperature, reaction pathway, burner type,
and miscibility (in short, “TRBM”), constitute the parameters of this
diagram. On the basis of flame aerosol synthesis of carbon
nanostructures with different dimensions, the investigations on
carbon–metal oxide nanocomposites by using flame spray pyroly-
sis are on the way.

As for diagnoses of flame synthesis processes, both in situ
methods based on laser probing and ex situ methods based on sam-
pling need basic understanding of physical processes during
application, i.e. aerosol dynamics during sampling and laser–
matter interaction during laser excitation. Particular in this review,
we summarize some representative laser-based diagnostics in a map
of photon-bandgap versus laser fluence, which illustrates that laser–
matter interactions at various levels reflect certain information of
the particles. Especially, in contrast to other diagnostics, the novel
PS-LIBS technique exhibits a promising prospect of in situ on-line
diagnosis of flame synthesis, since it can well meet the needs of
complex doping synthesis of mixed oxide nanomaterials.

To provide theoretical analysis of the complexities involved in
flame synthesis at different levels, various approaches are em-
ployed, from the continuum approach, i.e. PBM, to the nanoscale
approach, i.e. MD simulation. PBM is usually coupled with chem-
ical reactions and fluid flow to give complete macroscopic simulation
of the flame synthesis process. MD studies of collision, coales-
cence, and heterogeneous reaction are also reviewed. More
fundamental studies to provide experimental data to verify these
models at multiple scales should be conducted. For example, cluster
measurement techniques are just now being applied with fast
DMA systems coupled to mass spectrometers. The early stages of
cluster formation will help bridge the gap between gas-phase and
particle-phase measurements using a variety of spectroscopic tech-
niques. As stated, such techniques will also help in the verification
of cluster formation and growth models. In general, time-scale

analysis, i.e., calculation of characteristics times, is very helpful
for understanding the whole system and identifying the most
important mechanism(s).

Despite fruitful development of flame synthesis in the past 20
years, the challenges, and more appropriately, the opportunities are
still huge. Rather than just demonstration of flame synthesis to
produce single- or multi-component functional materials of ele-
ments in the periodic table, more attention should be paid to explore
the underlying physiochemical mechanisms that govern the complex
formation of nanocomposite materials at the atomic level, and then
to “upwardly” optimize the process design and to scale up reac-
tors. Moreover, clarification of related mechanisms, e.g., doping
mechanism or deposition mechanism, is needed for nanocomposite
synthesis as well as precise fabrication of functional devices. Looking
back to the research needs/challenges given in the introduction, the
prospective work lies in the following aspects accordingly:

(1) Controlling the morphologies/properties of nanoparticles with
atomic precision. While there are advanced methods that can
measure particle size down to sub-nanometer ranges, the real
time composition measurement still remains a challenge. For
instance, in situ non-intrusive optical diagnostics, in combi-
nation with ex situ sampling measurements, for both gaseous
precursors and nascent particles are greatly needed to further
reveal several important physical processes that are still not
clear, i.e., gas-to-particle formation and collision–coalescence
(coagulation). The nucleation mechanism, either homoge-
neous or heterogeneous, of nano-clusters should be
hierarchically studied by utilizing quantum and statistical me-
chanics and then validated by experiments; meanwhile, the
cross-linking between MD simulation and continuum collision/
sintering models should be established. Furthermore, from
a point of view of reactor design, the development of the stag-
nation flame configuration, the advanced quenching
technology for jet flames, and the novel spray technique (e.g.,
reactive spray, electrospray) enables us to control the syn-
thesis of nanoparticles at the atomic level; but the integration
and optimization of
these techniques still require
development.

(2) Scalable and economical manufacturing of nanostructured ma-
terials. For good reactor design and process optimization,
multi-scale modeling of chemical reactions, fluid flows, flame
dynamics, and particle dynamics during flame synthesis are
needed to predict the key parameters for controlling the
process, which presents a numerical challenge of various time
scales across several orders of magnitudes. The corrected
models for particle dynamics by using the atomic-level ap-
proaches, e.g. MD simulation, should be included into
macroscopic CFD simulations, aiding optimization and scale-
up of flame synthesis processes. Two diffusion flame
configurations, flame spray pyrolysis, and co-flow flame re-
actors, exhibit advantages at the industrial application level.
However, on-line diagnoses on these kinds of reactors are ur-
gently needed to control the scaled systems with respect to
nanomaterial characteristics and to validate the multi-scale
modeling of flame synthesis. In particular, laser-based diag-
nostics on atomization and sprays are of considerable interest,
despite being a significant challenge.

(3) Complex doping to produce functional nanocomposites. The mea-
surement and prediction of
formation of complex
nanocomposites, either mixed metal oxides or carbon-
metal oxide, are more challenging than that of a single
component. Indeed, in a nanocomposite synthesis process,
the effects of tracer species on doped nanoparticles (i.e. doping
mechanism), during either gas phase transformation or par-
ticle phase growth, are still not well theoretically studied.

Characteristic sintering rates of multicomponent nanoparticles
are urgently needed to be quantified not only at the atomic
level by using MD simulation, but also at the mesoscopic par-
ticle level by using kinetic theory of grains. Excitingly, on-
line in situ laser diagnostics of doping processes in flame
synthesis by observing the changing band-gap of mixed oxide
nanomaterials may become reliable given the rapid devel-
opment of phase-selective LIBS and other optical methods in
the past five years. The validation and verification between
measurement and theoretical prediction on the doping mech-
anism should be conducted in the near future.

(4) Directly fabricating flame-made materials into functional devices.
The fabrication of functional devices viz. one-step flame
aerosol deposition process has become of great interest in
recent years as a result of the minimization of process steps.
Compared with the aforementioned in-flame behaviors of
nanoparticles, the diagnostics and modeling of nanoparticles
in the deposition layer and on the substrate are much more
demanding. The difficulty of on-line optical diagnostics arises
from the thin boundary layer, the measurement noise induced
by the wall, etc. Then, from a theoretical point of view, highly
coupled processes of spray pyrolysis, flame synthesis, and
particle deposition in a narrow domain greatly increase the
complexity of numerical simulation, apart from the
complicated geometry induced by the deposition masks or
substrates. Actually, flame aerosol deposition research is at
the beginning stages, open to a whole new realm of
synthesis possibilities.

(5) Building theoretical models across several scales and validat-
ing them by in situ diagnostics data. Basically, for the above
four flame aerosol systems with different purposes, a gener-
alized framework on multi-scale, multi-domain models are
needed to overcome challenges posed by the highly nonlin-
ear multi-scale response of various kinds of flame systems.
Nevertheless, the multi-field effects such as the electric, fluid,
chemical, and thermal for both gas and particle phases should
be considered in-parallel. To achieve this, the mesoscopic ap-
proach like DEM and other Lagrangian particle methods, which
can bridge atomic-level MD simulations and PBM-based con-
tinuum model predictions, is of key importance but still
relatively unutilized. Moreover, the validation of the cross-
scale hierarchical models (shown in Fig. 22) by in situ data
from advanced diagnostics on gas, liquid, and particle phases
is very difficult. Without the interpretation of the hierarchi-
cal models on multi-physics transport phenomena, the
experimental data have little meaning.

Generally, potential application of flame-made materials and
devices will determine their prospects. In our eyes, these applica-
tions should cut across many fields, beyond just energy-related areas,
with joint interests among combustion, aerosol, and materials science
communities. For example, catalytically-assisted homogeneous com-
bustion of hydrocarbons using flame-made metal–support catalysts
may allow the abatement of unburned hydrocarbons in conven-
tional combustion engines and furnaces for emissions control. Flame-
coated thin films may be helpful in solving carbon deposition
problems in fuel spraying processes. Scalable flame synthesis of
photocatalysts for solar-energy conversion and energy storage ma-
terials have started but need more research and development to
become viable manufacturing routes. The nanocomposites of carbon
materials and inorganic metal oxides through a single-step flame
spray pyrolysis are of great relevance to many disciplines and fields,
extending to medicine, electronics, and catalysis. Finally, it must be
stated that significant empirical and mechanistic understanding have
guided the development of flame aerosol systems. Meanwhile, de-
velopments in measurement, modeling, and integration with process

control will further enable the development of flame aerosol reactor
systems to produce the nanomaterials and devices that will impact
society.
