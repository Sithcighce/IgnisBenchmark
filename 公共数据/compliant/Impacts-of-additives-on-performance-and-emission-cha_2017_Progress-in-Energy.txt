1. Introduction

Xhas spurred the search for improved die-
Depletion of fossil fuel resources and stringent emission mandates D
sel engines performance and cleaner combustion. One of the best approaches to solve these issues is to use
biodiesel/diesel additives. The effects of biodiesel/diesel additives on the performance and emissions of die-
sel engines were comprehensively reviewed throughout this article. The additives reviewed herein were
classified into five categories, i.e., oxygenated additives, metallic and non-metallic based additives, water,
antioxidants, and polymeric-based additives. The effects of each category on the engine performance (i.e.,
brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) and brake thermal efficiency (bte)) and emissions (i.e., CO, NOx, HC,
and PM) were exclusively summarized and discussed. Furthermore, various strategies used for adding water
like water-diesel emulsion, direct water injection, and adding water into the inlet manifold were illustrated
and their pros and cons were completely scrutinized. Finally, opportunities and limitations of each additive
considering both engine performance and combustion benignity were outlined to guide future research and
development in the domain.

world overall energy consumption is expected to grow by 56% in the
year 2040 in comparison with that of the year 2010 (Fig. 1A) [1]. On
the other hand, this growing use of fossil fuels as major energy car-
riers and the resultant emissions have been regarded as a serious
environmental concern. A report released in the year 2011 by the
Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center stated that the global
emissions of CO2 increased by 3.5 folds within the last half-century
(Fig. 1B) [2]. This is more concerning because this potentially unfa-
vorable trend is anticipated to further grow by 1.5 fold by the year
2050 (Fig. 1C) [3]. Such concerns over increasing energy demands
and environmental pollutions are not only shared by environmental-
ists but are also on the priority list of fuel producers and engine
manufacturers. On such basis and in response to these challenges

Pemissions regulations (Fig. 2), much effort has been put into improv-
ing existing fuels or innovating novel fuels as well as developing
new engine generations. It should be noted that the Volkswagen
emissions scandal unfolded in September 2015 by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also led to an increasing
pressure on methods used for measuring engine emissions. There-
upon, the European Union decided to introduce new testing in real-
world conditions called Real Driving Emissions, using Portable Emis-
sion Measurement Systems in addition to laboratory tests which
will be operational in 2017 [4].

PGenerally, diesel engines are advantageous compared to gasoline
engines due to their higher thermal efficiency, reliability and dura-
bility, less fuel consumption and less CO2 emission [5(cid:1)9]. However,
diesel engines also face major shortcomings such as increased NOx
emission [10]. As mentioned earlier and beside improvements in
engine technologies, improving fuel performance and emission char-
acteristics have also been regarded as a promising solution to change
the on-going unfavorable scenario mainly caused by the transporta-
tion sector. To achieve that, two strategies have been put forth, 1)
complete replacement of major petroleum-derived fuels used in the
transportation sector, i.e., diesel and gasoline (Fig. 3), with alterna-
tive fuels produced from renewable resources, i.e., biodiesel, and

tial replacement of these fossil fuels by using fuel additives. The
term fuel additive used throughout this article refers to any substan-
ces added to a fuel at any rates for their ability to alter fuel proper-
ties. Fig. 4 presents the current global production of bioethanol and
biodiesel as well as the future prospects of this fast-growing indus-
try [1]. Based on a prediction by International Energy Association,
27% of diesel, kerosene and jet fuels can be contributed by biofuels
till the year 2050. Moreover, application of biofuels could lead to 2.1
gigatonnes of CO2 emissions reduction annually [11,12].

PBiodiesel or mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids (FAs) is
one of the most interesting alternative fuels which is produced from
plant oils, animal fats or other lipids mostly through the transesteri-
fication reaction [13(cid:1)19]. Biodiesel is completely miscible with die-
sel and owing to its unique attributes i.e. no sulfur, no aromatics,
lower toxicity, and higher cetane number as well as containing about
X(cid:1)12% oxygen by weight [20(cid:1)23], could play a significant role in

Pimproving petroleum diesel properties esp. from the environmental
perspective. In better word, these characteristics could improve bio-
diesel combustion and consequently reduce hazardous emissions
(Fig. 5) [24(cid:1)29]. The most common biodiesel blends used worldwide
are B20 (20% biodiesel, 80% petroleum diesel) and B5, but the latter
is an ASTM-approved fuel for safe operation in any compression-
ignition (CI) engine designed to be operated on conventional diesel
[30].

number of studies have revealed that different methyl ester profiles
differently impact engine’s performance parameters e.g. adiabatic

PIn a survey, Xue et al. [41] reported that 80% of the published
papers on the effects of biodiesel on engine performances and emis-
sions after the year 2000 claimed reduced CO, HC and PM emissions.
They unanimously declared that the reductions achieved were
attributed to the higher oxygen content of biodiesel. Moreover, 84%
of the surveyed papers showed that the use of biodiesel meaning-
fully led to reduced CO emission because of lower carbon/hydrogen
ratio and higher oxygen content of biodiesel compared to diesel [41,
42]. Nevertheless, the impact of using biodiesel as diesel additive on
NOx emission is largely controversial for there is no general agree-
ment among the experimental results reported in the literature.

Pincreased NOx emission is more than those claiming otherwise [41,
55]. One major source of inconsistency in the literature concerning
NOx emission variations is that numerous factors could contribute to
this phenomenon, and that their relative importance varies with
engine technology and operating conditions [55]. For example,
mechanical fuel injection systems used in older diesel engine in
comparison with those of modern electronically-controlled diesel
engines cause an inadvertent advance in fuel
injection timing
because of the higher bulk modulus of compressibility of biodiesel
than diesel [65, 66].

POverall, although many research works emphasize that the appli-
cation of biodiesel beside its unique advantages such as promoting
sustainable rural development could also lead to a cleaner environ-
ment by reducing emissions, there is still a gap till biodiesel could be
accepted by all as an ideal alternative fuel. Such perception is attrib-
uted to increased NOx emission as stated above as well as biodiesel’s
lower energy content which could in turn increase fuel consumption
[67]. However, it is increasingly believed that such shortcomings
could be overcome by introducing new engine technologies, e.g.,
modern electronic fuel injection systems (owing to their flexibility
to fuel changes e.g. by retarding injection timing) [55, 68] and by
improving biodiesel characteristics by using different additives.

PIn addition to oxygenated additives such as biodiesel, bioalcohols,
etc. as major additives of diesel fuel, other additives such as water,
various metal-based additives, CNT, polymer wastes, detergents,
cold flow additives, and lubricants have also been reported by
numerous investigations [69(cid:1)76]. In case of water, various addition
methods like in emulsion with fuel or in a separate stream have
been taken into thorough consideration as well [77(cid:1)79]. It is worth

Pthat biodiesel increased the amount of emitted NOx [43(cid:1)47], while
some reported the opposite [24,48(cid:1)50]. There are also some investi-
gations in which no significant differences were observed between
biodiesel and diesel in terms of NOx emissions (Fig. 6) [51(cid:1)53].

PHigher combustion temperature, ignition delay, oxygen content,
and radiative heat loss are the most proposed theories to explain the
increased emitted NOx pollutant of biodiesel combustion [54(cid:1)62].
Some reports also stressed that the faster combustion rate of biodie-
sel was a key reason for higher NOx emissions [63, 64]. In general, it
seems that the number of papers indicating that usage of biodiesel

X‘-' represents the result

Pquoting that almost all additives used in diesel fuel are emulsified
into the fuel in the presence of a/a combination of surfactants and
sometimes by means of ultrasonicator devices [80,81].

PThis article is aimed at comprehensively reviewing the mecha-
nism and impacts of different additives used in biodiesel and diesel
fuels as well as their blends in order to enhance fuel properties. Vari-
ous additives including those improving engine power, reducing
improving fluid stability, decreasing wear,
harmful emissions,
enhancing viscosity index, etc. are taken into consideration. It should
be stressed that the present paper is focused on the steady state
operation condition investigations and the other diesel engines
operations or aspects such as transient, or under cyclic pressure var-
iations (irregularity) are not covered. It is worth mentioning that
most published studies report their findings under steady state con-
dition and there are very few review papers available discussing the
impacts of additives under these operation conditions. For instance,
Giakoumis et al. (2013) reviewed the emissions characteristics of
ethanol and n-butanol blending into diesel fuel during transient con-
dition [82].

2. Types of diesel additives

2.1. Oxygenated additives

PCombustion is a complicated process and therefore, many param-
eters could potentially influence on the amount of engine emissions.
One of the main sources diesel engine emissions originate from is
incomplete combustion of fuels mainly caused by lack of sufficient
oxygen [83]. Presence of oxygen in the structure of oxygenated addi-
tive could help to overcome this problem. Oxygenated compounds
by raising the oxygen to fuel ratio, offer an efficient solution to over-
come the incomplete combustion phenomenon. Effect of the addi-
tion oxygenated compounds to diesel
fuel has been widely
investigated [24,84(cid:1)90]. Although many oxygenated compounds
have been introduced, not all can be used in internal combustion
(IC) engines for some such as tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) have effec-
tively banned using it as a gasoline additive in many states of Amer-
ica due to its finding in groundwater, although there is inadequate
human evidence, and limited animal evidence, for the carcinogenic-
ity of MTBE [91,92]. The major oxygenated compounds currently-
used in combination with diesel fuel are methanol [93], ethanol [94],

Pn-butanol [95], glycerine tri-acetate [86], polyethoxy-ester [10],
butanol [96], ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) [97], methyl butanoate
[98], ethylene glycol monoacetate (EGM) [99], dimethyl ether (DME)
[100], dimethyl carbonate(DMC)
[101,102], diethylene glycol
dimethyl ether (DGM) [103], diethylene glycol diethyl ether (DGE)
[104], triacetin [105], acetone [106], di-n-pentyl ether (DNPE) [107],
dimethoxyethane [108], biodiesel [65,109,110], as well as various
mixtures of the above-mentioned additives.

PThe considerably high oxygen content of these compounds
results in a cleaner combustion which in turn leads to reduced diesel
engine emissions especially particulate matters [111,112]. Neverthe-
less, the caloric value of the oxygenated additives is less than that of
the diesel fuel, and therefore, their inclusion in diesel dilutes the
final energy content of blends [113]. Moreover, the presence of oxy-
genated additives in fuel could diminish the ignition temperature
depending on the chemical structure of additives (Table 3), oxygen
content of blend, and local oxygen concentration in the fuel plume
[109,114]. Investigating the combustion chemical kinetics of oxy-
genated additive could help better understand the relation between
temperature and oxidation rate of compounds. For instance, Coniglio
et al. investigated the combustion chemical kinetics of biodiesel and
showed that diminished combustion temperatures could lead to
weakened rate of biodiesel oxidation reaction in the chamber and
subsequently deteriorated combustion efficiency [115]. More specif-
ically, they reported that the high temperature of combustion
X°C) resulted in the maximum combustion reaction
(higher than 555 D
rate of different methyl esters but at low temperature values of
around 325 D
X°C, only up to 70% of the methyl ester reaction rate was
achieved while and this reaction rate was extremely diminished at
475 D
X°C. Overall, it could be concluded that fuels containing higher
amounts of compounds with low temperature reactivity and heat
release have shorter ignition delays or in better words ignite earlier
as they have higher cetane numbers than fuels containing lower
amounts of compounds with low-temperature reactivity [115(cid:1)117].
PIn order to select the most suitable oxygenated additives, one
should consider different properties of the additives i.e. boiling point
(> 60 °C), flash point (> 50 °C), oxygen content, energy density, self-
ignition temperature (< 350 °C), and kinematic viscosity (<D
X4 mm2/s)
[108,126]. In addition, other criteria e.g. density, and cetane number
may also be taken into account when reducing exhaust particulate
matter [111] is targeted [126,127]. Beside fuel quality-related

Pparameters, sometimes other characteristics such as the toxicity
level of an additive may also be considered. For instance, ethanol is
both less toxic and corrosive than methanol [128].

PThe above-mentioned oxygenated additives blend well with gas-
oline, but most are not miscible in diesel fuel. In fact, blends of these
additives with diesel have less stability and therefore, emulsifiers
and surfactants such as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) [129],
sodium dodecyl sulphate [130], ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran (used
for blend of ethanol and diesel), and NP-9 (used for blend of glycerin
and polyethoxy-ester C water C diesel) [10] need to be added to pre-
vent phase separation [128,131,132].

PIt is worth mentioning that several review papers have been pre-
viously published trying to compare the effects of oxygenated addi-
tives
inclusion on diesel engine performance and emission
parameters [133(cid:1)136]. Most of these reports are mostly focused on
major oxygenated aokdditives used in diesel engines, i.e., biodiesel,
ethanol, and methanol leaving out the others such as butanol, DME,
DEE, MTBE, and DGM (Table 4). Therefore, to offer a more conclusive
discussion, the present review comprehensively scrutinizes the per-
formance and emission characteristics of all studied oxygenated
additives.

P2.1.1. The effect of oxygenated additives on engine performance

Pbsfc
PIn theory, bsfc is bound to increase upon the inclusion of an oxy-
genated additive owing to the lower heating value and energy con-
tent of the fuel blend requiring more fuel to be injected to obtain the
same power output [147]. This has also been confirmed in practice
and many studies in which oxygenated-diesel fuel blends were
investigated showed slight increases in bsfc compared to diesel fuel
[96,106,129,147(cid:1)160].

PThe most commonly-used oxygenated additives are alcohols. In
parallel investigations on the effects of ethanol and methanol diesel
blends (i.e. ethanol-diesel and methanol-diesel), the results revealed
that methanol-diesel blends led to higher bsfc values than the etha-
nol-diesel blends [93,161,162]. More specifically, as the methanol or
ethanol concentration increases, bsfc increases as well but the
increase in bsfc for the methanol-diesel blends was found to be
more significant than that of the ethanol-diesel blends (Table 5)
[93,96,147,151,154,155,163(cid:1)168].

PIn different investigations, it was observed that for methanol-
blended diesel fuels, more fuel per energy extracted was consumed
as load decreased compared to ethanol-blended diesel fuels, these
difference were not tremendous though [161,180,182,187]. As a
result, more fuel carry-over or unburned fuel was recorded when
methanol-blended diesel fuels were used. This is perhaps ascribed to
the fact that methanol has a relatively higher heat of vaporization
than ethanol (1178 kJ/kg vs. 840 kJ/kg, respectively [198]), which
could affect the combustion process [180]. This problem could have
been fixed, to some extent, with better vaporization of fuel mixtures
if the engine had been run at full load or high loads, and/or intake air
had been preheated [93]. This issue would be intensified when the
share of an oxygenated additive in diesel fuel increases. For instance,
Pidol et alD
X. used 40% ethanol in B50 in presence of the EGR (as high
as 45%) and their results showed more than 50% increase in bsfc
compared to the neat diesel [75]. Such extensive increase in bsfc
could be attributed to diluted energy content of the fuel blend and
potentially incomplete combustion [129].

PThe disadvantages associated with using alcohols such as metha-
nol and ethanol as engine fuels, either neat or blended, are
highlighted by their low cetane index (methanol: 3D
X(cid:1)5 and ethanol:
8 [199] compared to the minimum value of 40 for diesel [200]),
which results in their difficult initiation in a CI engine. Different
strategies such as the application of cetane number improvers (e.g.
alkyl nitrate, di-tertiary butyl peroxide,), have been reported to com-
pensate for the bsfc increase as a consequence of alcohol-diesel

Pblend applications [161,182,201,202]. Alternatively, it has also been
reported that an alcohol-diesel fuel combination can be used in a CI
engine in an efficient manner i.e. improved bsfc and cleaner exhaust
emissions, provided that the intake air stream introduced into the
combustion chamber is sufficiently pre-heated [203,204]. As a third
measure, an ignition enhancer such as diethyl ether [205], glycerol
ethoxylate [206] or H2 could be added to the intake air stream
[205,207,208].

POverall, it could be concluded that the inclusion of all oxygenated
additives could result in increased bsfc values at different loads of
the engine. Obviously, the increasing trend of bsfc could also be
intensified at higher inclusion rates [148], as a result of the compara-
tively lower energy content and also the lower cetane index of these
additives leading to retarded injection timing, lower temperature
and consequently incomplete combustion [147,154,175]. A number
of studies have demonstrated that the increasing trend of the bsfc
was more obvious at low loads, but partially compensated for at
medium and higher loads owing to the higher temperatures reached
at high loads [95,129,163,164]. Similar results have been reported
for blends of diesel with butanol [95,96,150,166,209(cid:1)211], DME and
DEE [211,212].

in bsfc

some improvements

PWhen an oxygenated additive (other than biodiesel itself) is
included in biodiesel-diesel blends containing high proportions of
biodiesel,
could be observed
[164,179,186,213(cid:1)216]. One possible justification to this phenome-
non could be the impact of the additive inclusion on the viscosity
value of the final additive-biodiesel-diesel blend [186,217]. This has
been confirmed in a number of studies in which 20% ethanol (v/v)
was included in B20 leading to bsfc improvements over the biodie-
sel-diesel blend i.e. B20. They also reported that the bsfc value of the
ethanol-containing B20 was approximately comparable to what
obtained using neat diesel [172,179,186]. Raslavi(cid:1)cius and Bazaras
(2010) reported similar observation when they added 7.5% (v/v) eth-
anol to B30 [172]. As mentioned previously, such improvements
could be attributed to the fact that ethanol inclusion reduced the vis-
cosity of the final fuel blend to values identical to that of neat diesel
fuel. For instance, addition of 20% ethanol reportedly decreased the
X88 mm2/s making it comparable with the
viscosity value of B20 to 2.D
value measured for the neat diesel at 2.D
X84 mm2/s. The lower viscos-
ity of the alcohol used must have improved the air-fuel mixture for-
mation and due to the higher latent heat of vaporization of the
alcohol, the temperature of the in-cylinder compression strokes
reduced [147]. This in turn could have increased the volumetric effi-
ciency and reduced the necessary work for the compression process
[148]. Hypothetically, these sequential changes led to improved bsfc
values achieved in the mentioned experiments [148,151(cid:1)153].

PSimilar findings were obtained in other studies where methanol-
vegetable oil and butanol-vegetable oil mixtures were blended in
diesel-biodiesel. More specifically, the former mixture resulted in no
significant bsfc variation compared to the diesel-biodiesel blend,
while the latter slightly increased the bsfc value of the final blend.
This could be explained by the higher viscosity of butanol compared
to methanol [181,218,219]. Moreover, such bsfc variations could
also be attributed to the physicochemical properties of vegetable oil,
i.e., lower viscosity, flash point, and boiling point than those of diesel
[220,221].

PContrary to the above-mentioned investigations, a number of
studies have reported improvements in the bsfc when oxygenated
additives such as ethanol, DEE, 1,4-Dioxane, methanol were included
results were
in biodiesel-diesel blends [181,222,223]. Similar
reported by Karabektas et alD
X. (2015) who stud-
ied the impact of DEE and ethanol inclusion into a dual fuel compris-
ing of compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel [224,225]. Vedharaj
et alD
X. (2014) reported that a slight bsfc reduction was observed by
using dioxane-diesel blends, but they did not present any reasons
for their unexpected findings [56,226]. Balamurugan and Nalini

P[227] reported 8% and 9% reduction in bsfc values (at 80% load)
measured for 8% n-propanol and 8% n-butanol blended with die-
sel, respectively. In a different study, Patil and Thipse [228] also
reported trivial reduction in bsfc upon the addition of 15% DEE
to diesel.
Pbte
PBrake thermal efficiency (bte) is the ratio between the brake
power output and the energy introduced through fuel injection,
while the latter is the product of the injected fuel mass flow rate
and the lower heating value [147]. This parameter is more
appropriate than fuel consumption to evaluate the performance
of different fuels [147,175]. In general, biodiesel addition to die-
reportedly resulted in decreased bte values
sel
[50,229,230], but Wu et alD
X. (2016)
argued that blending oxygenated additives into biodiesel-diesel
could lead to increased bte drawing it back to the value of diesel
[27,216].

PIn a study, Fang et alD

X. (2013) retarded the engine injection timing
and reported that bte value of the ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blend
decreased [147]. This could be ascribed to the impact of ethanol on
lowering the cetane number of the fuel blend, which in turn aggra-
vated the auto ignition of fuel particles, and retarded the combustion
process [169]. For all the engine speeds tested at a regular air/fuel
ratio (λ D 1.5), they concluded that the bte decreases were propor-
tional to the increases in the oxygen content of the fuel blends [169].
Similar results i.e. slight bte reduction at high loads, were obtained
elsewhere when 5% ethanol was added into B15 [156,163] or 10%
ethanol was
compared to neat diesel
[156,158,159,163]. Later in a study on cotton oil-nbutanol-diesel
blends, Atmanli et alD
X [149] confirmed the previous findings but
highlighted that at low speeds, the bte reduction was intensified
reaching 31% compared to neat diesel. Such reductions may be
attributed to the lower heating values of ethanol-biodiesel and n-
butanol-cotton oil. It should also be noted that the properties of an
added oil into a fuel could play a major role in bte variations. This
X. (2014) who
has been verified by the findings of Vallinayagam et alD
investigated different pine oil(cid:1)diesel blends. Their unexpected
result revealed higher bte for pine oil(cid:1)diesel blend than neat diesel
[220,221].

added into B10

PIn addition, the density and cetane number of alcohols are lower
than those of diesel fuel. Therefore, the presence of n-butanol in cot-
ton oil-diesel and ethanol in biodiesel-diesel in the above-men-
tioned experiments must have prolonged the injection duration and
ignition delay resulting in more fuel being burnt during expand
stroke with a relatively lower combustion efficiency [179], and
finally decreased bte values. On such basis, several studies have

Psuggested that cetane number improver be used to enhance oxygen-
ated-diesel bte [106,182,201].

PInterestingly, some investigators have reported opposite findings
implying that the fuel blends containing oxygenated additives, e.g.,
DEE-biodiesel-diesel, DEE-diesel, DMC-diesel, ethanol-diesel, buta-
nol-diesel, n-butanol-diesel, di methoxyethane-diesel, and n-propa-
nol-diesel showed increased bte values [132,155,170,179,182,187,
209,211,214,231,232] (Table 5). Similar findings were reported
when DEE was applied in a dual CNG-diesel fuel [224]. The improved
bte value observed in these studies could be justified by taking into
account the relationship between bte and bsfc. More specifically, the
increases in bsfc as a result of the oxygenated additives inclusion
were not exactly proportional to the corresponding decreases in the
calorific values of the final fuel blends [155,160,166]. On the other
hand, the increases observed in bte value as a result of the oxygen-
ated additives could also be attributed to the improved combustion
and shortened combustion duration. This was stated by Senthil
Kumar and Jaikumar (2014) who studied the addition of ethanol and
water into WCO [233]. Similar explanation was presented by other
researchers when different alcohols were added into diesel fuel
[182,234,235].
PLei et alD

X. [132] studied the effect of three different blends of
ethanol-diesel (5, 10 and 15% of ethanol with a CLZ-type emulsi-
fier) on the bte value of a 4 cylinder diesel engine with natural
aspiration and the best results were obtained for the D90E10

X12%)
(2009) who investigated ethanol-diesel blends (D
with 1% dodecanol surfactant [152]. Recently, Labeckas et alD
X.
[169] highlighted the findings of the earlier studies stating that
the engine used in their investigation operating on lean combus-
tible mixtures and at low speeds did not function ideally at
higher than the 10 vol.% ethanol-diesel fuel blend. Overall,
it
could be concluded that the impact of oxygenated additives on
bte varies based on their inclusion rate and that there is a con-
sensus on the fact that better bte values could be achieved at
X10 vol.% [132,156,163,178,236].

Pethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends compared to diesel
fuel. They
argued that the increased bte could be attributed to a number of
reasons such as: 1) more pre-combustion mixing because of the
lower cetane number of alcohols [95,96,177,227],
leading to
higher percentage of ‘constant volume’ combustion [95,164,237-
239],2) more complete combustion caused by the additional
lubricity of biodiesel [179], 3) lower heat losses and ‘leaner’
combustion of ethanol-diesel blends [155] and 4) the oxygen
content of the blend fuels [132,179,185].

PEffect of alcohol addition has also been investigated by injec-
tion into intake manifold [195,197]. The results obtained showed
that alcohol had a negative effect on the bte [209,240]. This
could be explained by the higher heat of vaporization of ethanol
compared to diesel which could cool down the combustible mix-
ture and consequently reduce bte [195]. Nevertheless, these find-
ings were not in agreement with those of Morsy [79] who
claimed that bte value increased by 2% as a result of ethanol
inclusion in intake manifold. However, they stated that the varia-
tion was insignificant and possibly happened due to instrument
errors [151].

P2.1.2. The effect of oxygenated additives on engine emissions

PCO emission
PFormation of CO is the result of in-complete combustion. In fact,
if the in-cylinder temperature during combustion process is not suf-
ficient to support the complete combustion, then transformation of
CO to CO2 will not occur. It has been reported that as alcohols con-
centration in diesel blends increases, the CO emission increases as
well [93,131,152,169,182,185,188,198,210,241,242].D
X This could be
explained by the lower cetane number of alcohols and their higher
heat of vaporization requirements than diesel. In fact, blending of
alcohols with diesel decreases the overall cetane number of the fuel
and increases the ignition delay, which in turn leads to incomplete
combustion in the cylinder and consequently higher CO emissions in
the exhaust [129,151,171,182].

PFrom another perspective, increasing the oxygen content in the
ethanol-diesel and methanol-diesel blends lead to significant
increases in CO emission [106,131,154,159,162,172,175,178,241],
such increases are slight for n-butanol-diesel though [96,219]. This
theory has been confirmed through simultaneous investigations on
methanol and ethanol showing that the increases observed in CO
emissions D
Xwas smaller for ethanol under different loads than for
methanol [180,241,243]. Some studies have argued that the pro-
duced CO emission would be minimal when oxygen content D
Xis
around 7.5% [169,172]. For instance, Raslavicius et alD
X. [172] reported
that CO emissions of ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blend decreased till
the oxygen content of the blend reached 7.5%, and thereafter CO
emission began to increaseD
X. In fact, beyond this oxygen concentra-
tion, the low temperature and the local high equivalence ratio, both
are inclined to the increase of CO emissions [147,153,169,226]. A
number of studies have also showed that the application of EGR
intensified the produced CO emission of ethanol-diesel blends
[188,244]. More specifically, because of lower combustion tempera-
ture and local air/fuel equivalence ratio caused by EGR, alcohol
blending aggravates CO production. Similar justifications have been
offered for the impact of alcohol fumigation on increasing emitted
CO [195(cid:1)198,245] (Table 5). Increasing CO emission has also been
reported in dual fuel of CNG-diesel due to the decrease of the tem-
perature, but this emission increase was reportedly relieved by add-
ing other oxygenated additives to diesel fuel such as ethanol,
methanol or ethers [147,224,246].

PIt is needless to mention that the experimental conditions could
play a key role on the produced CO. Numerous reports have claimed
that the CO emissions increased drastically at lower loads and
decreased slightly at higher loads for ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends
compared to diesel fuel [93,132,155,164,173,179,186,187,189]. Such

PCO reduction trend at higher loads has also been reported for other
oxygenated additives blended into diesel such as DGM-diesel, DEE-
diesel, DEE-kerosene-diesel, dioxane-diesel [56,211,226,228], etha-
nol-butanol-diesel, n-butanol-diesel, nbutanol-biodiesel-diesel and
n-propanol-diesel (Tables 5(cid:1)7) [95,149,154,158,163,166,167,186,
213,214,218,227,247]. The maximum CO reductions recorded were
up to 44% for the blend of D65Bu5E30 [154] and 54% for D85B10E5
[163].

PThe main reason to the mentioned increases in CO emissions at
low loads of engine operation could be the decrease in the cylinder
gas temperature and the delayed combustion process [154,164,227].
This lower temperature and delayed combustion could suppress the
oxidation process even though enough oxygen would be available
for combustion [154,164]. Using CN improvers could easily compen-
sate for this CO emission increase of oxygenated additive-diesel
blend [130,156,182]. Moreover, some studies suggested that the rea-
son to reduction of the emitted CO at high loads of engine operation
would be the inbuilt fuel oxygen promoting the further oxidation of
CO during the engine exhaust process [154,163,164,179,227]. In case
of alcohols, their higher latent heat of vaporization in blends could
be regarded as a justification too. Also, reduction of CO emission has
been linked to the lower carbon to hydrogen (C/H) ratio of alcohols
[163,166,248,249]. Simultaneous study of ethanol, butanol and DEE
in diesel-biodiesel blends by Imtenan et alD
X. [183] showed that etha-
nol had the minimal CO emission compared to the other two oxy-
genated additives. Similar results were achieved by Sayin et alD
X. [151]
who reported that compared to neat diesel, methanol-diesel led to
lower CO emissions (30% and 27% reduction for M10 and M5, respec-
tively), than ethanol-diesel (24% and 7% reduction for E10 and E5,
respectively) at high load and different engine speeds [151,176].

POn the contrary, Yilmaz et alD

X. [181,243] in their studies did not
observe any significant reductions in CO emissions at high loads as a
result of alcohol addition into biodiesel. Among the oxygenated
additives reviewed herein, only blends of diesel and different types
of ether had stably-reducing effects on the CO emission
[56,131,183,226,250(cid:1)254] (Table 7).

X. [147] and Sharon et alD

PInjection timing is also an important experimental condition.
Fang et alD
X. [256] argued that CO emissions of
alcohol-biodiesel-diesel blends increased as injection timing was
retarded and that these increases were higher in the presence of the
oxygenated additives that when neat diesel was used. Unlike their
claims, the unexpected results of Hulwan et alD
X. [164] showed that
the CO emission remained unchanged with respect to injection tim-
ing but they presented no justification. In a different study using
DME-diesel blend, the CO emissions were found lower in the before
top dead center (TDC) ranging from 10° to 25° but when the injec-
tion timing was advanced to before TDC of 30°, rapid increase in CO
emissions were recorded [257]. Besides, the type of injection system
is also among the important factor that could influence the amount
produced CO. For instance, Merritt et alD
X. [165] investigated the effect
of the type of injection pumps on the combustion characteristics of
different ethanol-diesel blends. Their findings showed that the
rotary pump line nozzle (used for a 6.8 lit engine) produced more CO
emission when the engine was fueled with ethanol-diesel blend
compared to diesel fuel, whereas the oxygenated fuel led to less CO
emission by using the high pressure common rail (used for 8.1 lit
engine) and electronic unit injectors (used for 12.5 lit engine). In
addition to the type of the injection pump, the fuel injection strate-
gies could also play an important role in the amount of CO emitted
X. [258] strived to investi-
[130,257]. In an interesting study, Kim et alD
gate the possibility of improving exhaust emission characteristics of
a DME-fueled diesel engine by using three alternative types of multi-
ple injection strategies (i.e. split injection, pilot injection, and par-
tially pre-mixed charge compression ignition (PPCCI)) compared to
the conventional single injection type. The results obtained revealed
that the PPCCI extremely increased CO emission, while the Pilot

Preduced the CO emissions by up to 33% and the split did not cause
any differences [258].

PIn an isolated study on the carbon chain length of oxygenated
X. [259] claimed
additives and its impact on CO emissions, Sukjit et alD
that the combustion of short chain length methyl esters and alcohols
(ethanol and butanol) led to reduced CO. This could mainly be
ascribed to the lower viscosity associated with shorter carbon chain
lengths [259]. They also argued that unsaturated compounds
reduced CO emissions compared to the saturated counterparts (e.g.
C18:D
X1 vs. C18:0), as a result of their lower viscosity and higher vola-
tility [259].

PNOx emission
PThe most troublesome emissions from CI engines are NOx [164].
The oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust emissions contain nitric oxide
(NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) [164,260]. Several factors could
potentially affect NOx formation, but there are usually synergistic
and antagonistic interactions among them when oxygenated addi-
tives are included into diesel fuel. For instance, lower cetane number
and oxygen content of fuel blends containing such additives could
lead to higher temperature peaks which could in turn result in
increased NOx formation [94,100,131,149,151,153,179,181,186,218,
219,241,261,262]. On the other hand, higher enthalpy of vaporiza-
tion and lower adiabatic flame temperature of oxygenated fuel
blends could lead to lower in-cylinder temperature peaks and conse-
quent
formation [147,151,153,161,173,182,259
,263,264]. Finally, such additives may exert their impact via increas-
ing ignition delay. This increased ignition delay could consequently
results in an intense premixed combustion phase [265], higher
amounts of fuel burned in this phase and hence, an increase in the
combustion temperature [93,95,163,164,254,266,267].

reduced NOx

PSuch interactions among the above-mentioned factors could
eventually change the trend of NOx formation positively or nega-
tively depending on engine characteristics and/or operating condi-
tions [223]. Accordingly, some studies have reported increases in
NOx emissions [94,164,173,186] while some have claimed otherwise
upon the addition of alcohols to diesel compared to diesel fuel
[153,155,159,164,178,182,241,242]. Such controversial findings fur-
ther emphasize on this delicate balance weighing more on the one

Por the other side, depending on a specific engine and its operating
conditions [164] and that there is still no consensus on the effect of
oxygenated-diesel fuel blends on NOx emissions because their com-
plex combustion process [94]. At all, according to a big number of
experimental test results of various types of biofuels reviewed by
Lotko [268], NOx production largely depends on the ignition condi-
tions.

PAs mentioned earlier, increasing oxygen content in oxygenated
fuel blends has been introduced as a driving force for increased NOx
emissions. It has also been debated that oxygen content exerts more
influence on NOx formation than the higher enthalpy of vaporization
and lower adiabatic flame temperature caused by these blends
X. [131] used two differ-
[94,95,131,151,163,166,176,186]. Wang et alD
ent oxygenate additives with ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD) simul-
taneously and their results showed that NOx emission increased
with the increase of oxygen content for the ethanol-ULSD blends but
decreased with the increase of oxygen content for the DGM-ULSD
blends in comparison with the neat ULSD fuel. They stated that this
difference was attributed to the low heating value (24.5 MJ/kg) and
high cetane number (126) of DGM (Table 3) which led to decreased
amounts of fuel burned in the premixed combustion phase, and con-
sequently reduced combustion temperature [131,262,269]. Similar
justification has been put forth for NOx reduction caused by dual
fuels [224], n-butanol-diesel [95,150,210,270], n-propanol-diesel
[95,96,177,227] and ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends [95,147,158,
161,179,189]. It is worth quoting that lowering aromatic content in
fuel as is the case of oxygenated additives, has also been reported to
reduce NOx emission [95,131].

PIn a different study comparing the impacts of alcohols (butanol
and Ethanol) and an ether-based additive; DEE, in biodiesel-diesel
blends, minimal NOx emission was achieved by DEE [183]. Similar
findings have been reported elsewhere indicating significant NOx
reduction using ethers as additives to neat diesel or biodiesel-diesel
blends [228,253,271]. However, this was not the case when the
engine was completely fueled by ethers such as DME100 where
slight increases in NOx emissions occurred in comparison with diesel
fuel (Table 7) [250-252,254,272]. Some other studies have also
claimed NOx emission reduction using other types of oxygenated

Padditives e.g. EGM-diesel, triacetine-biodiesel, di methoxy ethane-
diesel, ethanol-DEE and 1,4-dioxane-diesel blends [56,108,156,
226,273].

PContrary to the reports elucidated above, numerous reports have
reported that oxygenated additives led to increased NOx emission
[131,151,152,163,164,167,169,171,175,185,187,213,214,218]
(Tables 5(cid:1)7). The increases observed in NOx for the methanol-diesel
and butanol-diesel blends have been more significant than what
observed for the ethanol-diesel blends [151,173,209,259]. Interest-
ingly, compared to inclusion in neat diesel, the behavior of alcohols
is significantly different when added to biodiesel-diesel blends
where they exert reducing impacts on NOx emissions. Ethanol has
been found more effective in reducing NOx emissions than methanol
when used as additive to biodiesel-diesel blends [93,147,161,166], a
number of studies did not confirm such results completely though
[181,241]. Such positive effects of alcohols could be attributed to the
cooling effect of alcohols in particular ethanol leading to lower tem-
peratures in the cylinder combustion where NOx is formed
[132,243].

PAddition of straight vegetable oil to different diesel fuel blends
reportedly led to incomplete combustion and more NOx emission
owing to the higher fuel density and lower cetane number of the

Presulting blend [149,181,218,220,221,275]. However, contrary to
X. (2006) compared the inclusion of
these reports, Rakopoulos et alD
biodiesel and its feedstock oil into diesel in separate experiments
and claimed that both equally slightly reduced the NOx emission
value [276]. Overall, the application of simple alcohols (5D
X(cid:1)10% v/v),
thanks to their higher heat of vaporization requirements and lower
cetane numbers than straight vegetable oil has been recommended
for improving the fuel properties in cases where these properties
were negatively affected by straight vegetable oil inclusion in diesel
[181].

PIt has also been reported that the NOx emission in response to the
inclusion of the oxygenated additive displays various trends at dif-
ferent loads. At low loads, the cooling effect of additives such as eth-
anol, methanol and DEE into the diesel or biodiesel-diesel (with a
higher latent heat of evaporation), could be more dominant than the
impact caused by the oxygen content of these additives resulting in
lower NOx emission [93,100,154,163,164,280,281]. As the load
increases, the cooling effect is minimized due to the significant rise
in combustion temperature and therefore, the oxygen content
impact surfaces resulting in increased NOx emissions. These have
been confirmed by experimental observations using ethanol-diesel,
blends
ethanol-biodiesel-diesel,

ethanol-butanol-diesel

P[93,147,152,154,163,181,243,281,282]. In opposition to the above
reports however, some researchers have claimed NOx reductions in
all ranges of operation in response to the addition of oxygenated
additives, e.g., n-butanol [95,96,211,247], DEE [211,228] and ethanol
[130,161,174] into diesel. It is worth quoting that a number of stud-
ies attributed the low NOx emission of diesel engine fueled by ethers
to
combustion duration
and
shorter
[250,272,283].

PSome researchers reported that ethanol-biodiesel-diesel com-
bustion in presence of high EGR, in contrast to the above results,
showed NOx increases at low loads and NOx decrease at high loads
[106,129,187]. The contradictory findings at low load could be justi-
fied through the impact of EGR naturalizing the cooling effect of the
oxygenated additives used by heating the intake air. On the other
hand, at higher loads exhaust gas has higher amount of CO2 which
reduces maximum temperature in the combustion chamber [284].

POverall, more attention has been paid to load than speed most
supposedly due to its more significant impact on the combustion
process. However, experimental results have indicated that engine
speed could also be differently influenced by the inclusion of oxy-
genated additives into diesel. More specifically, blending of simple
alcohols such as ethanol and methanol with diesel fuel reportedly
led to more NOx emission at low speed and less NOx emission at
high speed but the magnitude of these differences would change
depending on air/fuel ratios applied [151,169,179].

PIt has also been noticed that NOx emissions drastically increased
with advanced injection timing using neat diesel as well as diesel
[131,150,164,175,176,
blends containing oxygenated additives
183,226,246,250]. For instance, Hulwan et alD
X. stated that when the
injection timing was advanced from 138to 218 before TDC for all
speeds, NOx emissions doubled [164]. The deteriorating effect of
advanced injection timing on NOx emissions (regardless of the type
of diesel fuel used), is in fact related to the higher amounts of fuel
burnt pre-TDC leading to increased cylinder gas temperature.

PFatty acid profile i.e. the type of carbon chain of the oxygenated
additives has been found to exert significant effects on the NOx pro-
X.
duction. For instance, the results of a study conducted by Sukjit et alD
[259] showed that the amount of NOx emitted was proportional to
the carbon chain length and unsaturation degree of methyl esters.
They stated that among all carbon chains, C18:0 had the most effect
on reducing engine exhausted NOx [259]. On the other hand, higher
degrees of unsaturation clearly led to higher NOx emissions due to
increase in bulk modulus and decrease in cetane number
[36,259,285,286]. As a consequence, it is suggested the use of short
chain length methyl esters in ethanol blends [259].

PIn a number of studies, the effect of alcohol fumigation on the
NOx pollutant has been scrutinized [184,192(cid:1)197, 209,245,287,288].
In these studies, NOx concentration was reportedly lower by 10 to
15% for the entire range of loads when alcohol fumigation was
employed. They argued that the reduction achieved was due to cool-
ing effect of the alcohol.

POn a different parameter, it is worth quoting that different pump
injection system could also result in various NOx production scenar-
ios. In a pioneer study by Merritt et alD
X. [165], the effect of three dif-
ferent pump injection systems using ethanol blended diesel fuels on
NOx production was analyzed. They reported improvements in NOx
emissions on the rotary pump line injector (used in the 6.8D
XL engine)
and electronic unit injector (used in the 12.5D
XL engine), but opposite
results were obtained in case of the high pressure common rail injec-
Xl engine) [165]. Beside the type of injection sys-
tor (used in the 8.1D
tems, the injection strategy could also be effective on the exhausted
NOx. The findings of an investigation by D
X. who studied a
number of injection strategies revealed that multiple injection strat-
egies e.g. Pilot, Split and PPCCI led to lower levels of exhausted NOx
than using a single injection strategy [258]. Their results were later
X. [289] when the multiple injection strategy
confirmed by Yoon et alD

XKim et alD

Pused i.e. Multiple (pilot)-injection mode led to an improvement con-
cerning the emitted NOx. They also discovered that by advanced tim-
ing of the first injection of the multiple injections, lower NOx levels
could be achieved [289].

(e.g.

increased/decreased temperature of

POverall and as extensively elaborated above, NOx could be influ-
enced by upstream (pre-combustion) parameters and their conse-
quent
the
combustion chamber), during the main stream reaction (combustion
process). For instance, for biodiesel-diesel and ethanol-diesel blends,
the application of CN improvers has been found to result in NOx
reduction [182,201]. EGR also reduces the peak temperature by
diluting the charge with burnt exhaust gas. Therefore, higher NOx
emission reductions could be achieved through higher percentage of
EGR but results into a loss in thermal efficiency and increased HC
[192,193,244,290,291]. To decrease NOx emission, engine after-
treatment devices, such as lean NOx traps (LNTs) [292], urea-selec-
tive catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) [293,294], and Hydrocarbons
Selective Catalytic Reduction (HC-SCR) [295-298] as well as the com-
bination of EGR and catalysts have also been reported [295]. It
should also be highlighted that engine after-treatment technologies
are still widely considered very efficient in reducing different engine
emissions [299(cid:1)304].

PHC emission
PUnburned fuel or HC pollutant is affected by a number of factors.
For instance, it is well-known that HC emissions are mainly formed
at low-temperature regions, such as boundary layer, near the walls,
and crevice layer, etc. [147,155,226,305-309]. In addition to that, the
fuel trapped in the injector could also be a source of HC generation.
This fuel is in fact what left in the injector at the end of each injection
process. It is worth quoting that this fuel diffuses out during the
internal between two consequent injections but does not burn
completely proportional to the chemical and physical properties of
the fuel blend [186,188,310]. Moreover, engine loads and speeds
could also influence the produced HC emissions [169]. Overall, low
loads and speeds of engine are not in interest of produced HC emis-
sion and therefore, when investigating the impacts of oxygenated
additives on HC emissions, these parameters should also be taken
into account [189].

PSeveral studies have shown that the HC emitted by alcohol-diesel
fuel blends was higher than the corresponding neat diesel fuel at
low loads and speeds [95,153,170,174,176,178,182,213,214,223,
242,311]. Such increases in HC with the addition of alcohols could be
attributed to the higher heat of evaporation of the fuel blends, caus-
ing slower evaporation and thus, slower and poorer fuel-air mixing
[163,173,174,188,312], as well as lower in-cylinder combustion tem-
perature [153,155,182,187] [193]. Among alcohols and at low loads
and speeds, butanol-blended diesel has been reportedly led to more
increases in HC emissions [95,96,149,209,210,247,313]. This result
could be explained by the comparatively lower heat of vaporization
requirement of butanol than the other alcohols (latent heat of vapor-
ization for butanol, ethanol and methanol are 474, 725.4 and
X1103 D
XkJ/kg, respectively) [314,315]. This effect is much more notice-
able during cold start [228]. Moreover, the longer ignition delay of
alcohol-blended diesel fuels could also lead to over-mixed equiva-
lence ratio region, which could in turn result in increased HC emis-
sions [147,188].

POn the other hand, increasing speed and load in diesel engines
generally results in improved fuel combustion and consequently less
HC emission. Alcohols also exert positive (decreasing) effects on
emitted HC when added to diesel fuel at high loads and speeds; con-
trary to their impacts at low load and speed. Sayin et alD
X. [151] com-
pared ethanol-diesel and methanol-diesel blends and reported that
ethanol led to more significant reductions in HC emissions. They
specified that the decreases achieved in total unburned HC emis-
sions in comparison with neat diesel were 40 and 37% for E10 and
M10, respectively [151]. Also, the results of some studies showed

Pthat alcohol (i.e. ethanol and butanol) fumigation into the inlet man-
ifold up to 10% led to reduced HC emissions [173,193], but further
increased HC emissions
increases
[174,184,195(cid:1)198,209,245,316,317].

fumigation rate

in the

PAddition of ethanol to biodiesel-diesel blend could lead to differ-
ent results because of different final characteristics of ethanol-bio-
diesel-diesel blend. Interestingly, ethanol’s impact on HC emissions
of the ternary blend was reportedly proportional with its concentra-
tion in the blend i.e. reducing effect at low concentrations and
increasing effect at high concentrations [94,163,188,216,243]. An
explanation could be sustained by the cetane number influence of
ethanol and biodiesel. More specifically, biodiesel possesses a higher
cetane number than diesel fuel facilitating an easier ignition and
more complete fuel blend combustion, while the ethanol’s low
cetane number would act in an opposite manner specially when it is
applied at high concentrations [163,217,318(cid:1)320].

PYilmaz et alD

X. [181] argued that when the amount of alcohol in
biodiesel-diesel blend was increased to 10%, the reduction achieved
in HC emission diminished by a large extent but they later managed
to compensate it by replacing 5% of the amount alcohol added with
vegetable oil. They attributed this finding to the better vaporization
and combustion characteristics of alcohol- vegetable oil as a result
of the higher heating value and cetane number of vegetable oil com-
pared to those of ethanol [181,219,321]. Moreover, the vegetable oil
must have improved the low lubricity characteristic of the alcohol
[181]. Similar justification has been presented elsewhere for the
improvement obtained when pine oil and DEE was added into diesel
and CNG-diesel dual fuel, respectively [220,221,224]. Overall, at high
loads, butanol lowers HC emission more significantly when included
in biodiesel-diesel blends compared to ethanol, methanol and DEE
[181,183]. It is worth quoting that reduction of HC emission has also
been reported in the literatures when diesel engine fueled with
blended
biodiesel-diesel
[56,131,156,226,250(cid:1)254]. Reduction in premixed burn peak has
been presented as a justification for HC emission reduction by the
inclusion oxygenated additive into diesel fuel [262].

and

PIn a study by Yilmaz and Sanchez (2012), they stated that the
addition of ethanol to neat biodiesel led to no significant differences
in HC emissions at full load while resulted in increased HC in low
loads (especially below 50% load) [180]. It is worth quoting that the
chemical and physical characteristics of biodiesel are directly related
to its methyl ester profile. For instance, Sukjit et alD
X. [259] showed
that C18:0 and C12:0 were most effective in increasing and decreas-
ing HC emission, respectively. Moreover, unsaturated compounds
were shown to clearly produce higher amounts of HC emissions
than short chain length saturated methyl ester.

blends

PNumerous studies have also aimed at investigating the impact of
alcohols concentration on HC emission when added to different bio-
diesel-diesel
[93,130,132,163,171,186,187,211,241,243].
These reports have unanimously claimed that as alcohol concentra-
tions in blends increase, HC emission increases as well. Interestingly,
similar results have been reported upon the addition a different
alcohol to an alcohol-diesel blend such as ethanol to butanol-diesel
[154,227,270]. Such reports could be
and n-propanol-diesel
explained by the findings of Labeckas et alD
Xpertaining to the impact
of oxygen mass content of fuel blends on HC emissions [169]. More
specifically, they argued that HC emission is correlated with the fuel
oxygen mass content of ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends [169]. They
further elaborated that HC emission showed a significantly decreas-
X(cid:1)5.6 wt%,
ing trend within a specific range of oxygen content i.e. 3.9D
but on the two sides of this range, HC emission had increasing
trends. This justification could also be confirmed by the findings of

oxygen content) [172]. Contrary to these reports, Wang et alD

Pwho simultaneously studied the combustion characteristics of etha-
nol-ULSD and DGM-ULSD, did not report variations in HC emissions
around a specific concentration range of ethanol and DGM. They
reported an increasing trend of HC emissions proportional with the
increasing concentrations of the mentioned additives.

PIt has also been reported that HC emissions are directly related to
air/fuel ratio as well [169]. For instance, Labeckas et alD
X. demon-
strated that HC emissions of ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends could
X30 times by increasing the λ from 1.5 to 5.5 [169].
be reduced by >D
Injection timing has also been shown to impact HC emissions when
engines were fueled by ethanol-biodiesel-diesel and DEE-diesel
blend [147,175,257]. Retarded injection timing or longer ignition
delay could lead to an over-mixed equivalence ratio region which
could consequently lower the combustion temperature and increase
HC emissions [147]. The application of EGR when oxygenated addi-
tives-diesel blends are used has been reportedly led to increased HC
emissions. This could be ascribed to the impact of EGR in lowering
combustion temperature [188,244,322(cid:1)324].

PMoreover, it has also been documented that the type of injection
pump could also influence HC emissions. For instance, Merritt, et alD
X.
revealed that rotary pump line nozzle produced less CO emission
than high pressure common rail and electronic unit injectors when
the engine was fueled with ethanol-diesel blend compared to diesel
fuel [165]. On the issue of injection strategy, Kim, et alD
X. argued that
in comparison with single injection, Pilot and Split injection strate-
gies reduced HC emissions while PPCCI strongly increased the emit-
ted HC [258].

PPM emission
PParticulate matter consists of soot and other liquid or solid-phase
components [131]. Oxygenated compounds exert their impacts on
the emitted PM by changing the properties of fuel and obviously by
increasing its oxygen content. In a number of studies, the higher
level of oxygen has been highlighted as the reason behind the signif-
icant reductions achieved in PM emissions when alcohol-diesel
blend was used [316,325,326].
[183]
reviewed the relation between oxygen content and PM/smoke and
argued that a high degree of significance (R2 D 0.95) exists between
PM reduction capability of an oxygenated additive and its oxygen
content (compared with neat diesel fuel).

Imtenan et alD

In 2014,

X.

PThe alcohol-diesel blends and biodiesel-diesel blends behave
slightly differently in terms of their reducing effect on PM emissions.
This could be ascribed to the fact that biodiesel-diesel blends
advance the ignition timing while alcohol-diesel blends retard the
ignition timing [235,327(cid:1)330]. This change in ignition timing
could influence the emissions
including PM. PM emission
reduction has frequently been reported when ethanol-diesel blends
[107,126,131,161,165,173,185] and ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends
[5,94,155,186,187,223,331] were investigated. However, Sukjit et alD
X.
[259] argued that compared to neat diesel fuel, the reduction
achieved in emitted PM by using alcohol-biodiesel-diesel blends
would be more than biodiesel-diesel blends (with the same oxygen
content). The could be justified by the lower volatility of the hydro-
carbons emitted using biodiesel blends in comparison with those
emitted using alcohol blends [259] as well as by the different struc-
ture of these fuelsD

X' molecules [332].

PBeside oxygen content of the blends, other properties like cetane
number and viscosity, and even the type of the oxygenated additive
and/or its chemical structure could also affect PM emissions
[106,131,332]. In fact, all these parameters could partly influence
the distribution of the injected fuel into the chamber which could in
turn impact the emissions [83]. For instance, the ester structure of
biodiesel has been found less effective in reducing the PM than the
structure of alcohols and ethers leading to relatively higher smoke
emissions for biodiesel-diesel blends than alcohol-diesel [131], or
ether-diesel blends [333]. In line with that, dramatic PM reductions
have been reported using DME-diesel blends, compared to diesel

Pfuel under different engine operation conditions [97,253,289]. These
very low PM emissions could be linked to DME molecular structure,
i.e. the lack of direct carbon(cid:1)carbon bonds making soot-free com-
bustion possible [295]. Patil and Taji (2013) reported reductions in
emitted PM by 52% through the addition of only 5% DMC to diesel
fuel [126] while Balasubramaniyan et alD
X achieved signifcant reduc-
tion by adding as little as 1% Di Methoxy Ethane into the diesel fuel
[108]. Although PM emissions generally increase when load
increases, but more PM reductions could be accomplished at high
loads in the presence of oxygenated additives in comparison with
diesel fuel [100,164,171]. This could be attributed to the cooling
impact of oxygenated additives which is more highlighted at high
loads and consequent higher combustion temperatures.

PUnlike the PM, NOx emissions of oxygenated-diesel fuel blends
are generally similar to that of neat diesel or slightly higher
[185,186]. However, in a number of studies, simultaneous reduction
of PM and NOx have been reported in the presence of oxygenated
additives [104,107,131,269,334,335]. For instance, Happonen et alD
X.
[107] reported that the highest decrease in PM emissions i.e. 25%
occurred at 100% load at which 5% reduction in NOx emission was
also recorded. However, they attributed this simultaneous reduction
to the presence of EGR and not to the oxygenated compound
included [107]. In a different investigation, Wang et alD
X. [131] and
Herreros et alD
X. [104] also reported simultaneous reduction of PM and
NOx using DGM-diesel and DGE-ethanol-diesel fuel blends, respec-
tively. They attributed the reduction in PM to the increased oxygen
content of the blends while identified shortened ignition delay (due
to high cetane number of blend) as the cause of the reduced NOx. In
better words, the higher cetane number of the blends owing to the
presence of DGM led to less amount of fuel burned in the premixed
combustion phase, resulting in the reduction in NOx emissions.
Thus, DGM addition could weaken the PM-NOx trade-off curve in
conventional diesel engines [131,334].

PCompared to neat diesel fuel, substantial reductions in PM emis-
sion over all engine load conditions by using alcohol fumigation into
the inlet manifold have been reported by numerous investigations
X. [240] found methanol fumiga-
[196,317,325,336(cid:1)338]. Zhang et alD
tion more effective on PM reduction than ethanol fumigation (40%
and 20% reduction for 20% methanol and ethanol fumigation, respec-
tively). Less diesel fuel consumption with increasing fumigated alco-
hol into the cylinder could be considered as the main cause of this
reduction. In fact, less fuel (blend) is burned using the fumigated
homogenous alcohol/air mixture as it helps the fuel burn faster and
with higher availability of oxygen, leading to reduced PM emissions
[316].

2.2. Metallic and non-metallic based additives

P2.2.1. Metallic-based additives

PBeing used in diesel fuel before the year 2000, the application of
nano-sized metallic additives diminished ever since, however,
metal-assisted combustion has received renewed interest in recent
years [339]. Nano-sized metal particles have different characteristics
in comparison with larger-sized materials. Super paramagnetic
behavior, super plasticity, lower freezing point, lower sintering tem-
peratures, higher ignition probability, high catalytic activity and
higher theoretical densities are some of the unusual properties of
these materials [339(cid:1)344]. The improving effects of metallic-based
additives on fuel properties and diesel emissions (PM, CO, and spe-
cially NOx) have been frequently reported in the literature [345-
348]. These additives exert their effects in two different ways: 1) the
metals react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals, which
enhance soot oxidation, or 2) react directly with carbon atoms in the
soot, thereby lowering the oxidation temperature [349]. Different
metallic additives in diesel fuel have been investigated for their
effects on performance and exhausted emissions of diesel engines

Psuch as manganese (Mn) [350], cerium (Ce) [351], Fe [352], copper
(Cu) [350], platinum [105,353], platinum-cerium (Pt-Ce) [353,354],
Nickel (Ni) [355], titanium (Ti) [356], Zinc (Zn) [357], zirconium (Zr)
[358] and aluminum (Al) [359].

PThe inclusion of mn-based nanoadditive in diesel fuel was report-
edly effective in reducing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
emission significantly [360]. PAH is one of the most dangerous
engine emissions and is known as carcinogenic agent. Nanoadditives
of Fe, Mn and Ce were significantly effective in reducing PM emis-
sion [361]. The most desirable metallic nanoparticles property has
been attributed to their potential ability to store energy in surfaces
[362,363]. Most of metallic oxide additives act as an oxygen donat-
ing/absorbing catalyst i.e. they could provide oxygen for the oxida-
tion of CO or absorb oxygen for the reduction of NOx [352,364,365].
Another aim of using metal oxides such as TiO2 is to activate the
molecular bonding in the water/diesel emulsion and to take advan-
tage of the photoelectrocatalytic effect of these metal oxides to gen-
erate hydrogen from water [366,367].

PMetallic nanoparticles in diesel fuel as additives have been
employed in two ways: bimetallic (like Pt-Ce and Al-Mg) [368] and
organic metallic additives (like ferrocen, MgO and CuO) [368,369].
The latter are metal additives which could be homogeneously dis-
solved into the diesel fuel [370]. Application of metallic-based addi-
tive in neat diesel or biodiesel-diesel blended fuels may not be easy
due to blend instability [371]. To avoid sedimentation, they are cou-
pled with other materials before blending with diesel. For example,
Ganesh and Gowrishankar coated nanoparticles of Al-mg with Cetyl
Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide to overcome the solubility chal-
X. (2015)
lenges [368].
employed amide-functionalized multiwall
carbon nanotubes
(MWCNT) as a carrier to solubilize cerium oxide (CrO2) in biodiesel-
diesel blends (B5 and B20).

In a different study, Mirzajanzadeh et alD

PEnvironmental aspect of fuel additives is also very important but
there are very few studies investigating on the health consequences
of the application of additives (specially metallic-based additives)
[146,372]. For instance, contrary to the general perception, Yang et
X. claimed that metallic-based additives led to decreased emission
alD
of carcinogenic substances [360].

fuel

bsfc
PIt has been reported that the addition of metal nanoparticle to
diesel fuel could result in accelerated combustion rates, reduced
ignition delay, boosted calorific values, decreased burn times, and
rapid oxidation which all could lead to a more complete combustion
[339,373,374]. The bsfc reduction has been reported for all the
metallic additives when blended into diesel
(Table 9)
[134,364,369,375(cid:1)381]. Fuel consumption reduction is mainly
caused by improving fuel combustion. Ma et alD
X. [370] achieved a fuel
saving of 3.7% by using ferrous thiocyanate (FTC) in diesel (1:3200)
under the test condition of 3200 rpm and 0.14 MPa brake mean
effective pressure (bemp) [382]. Their achievement was in line with
those of the previous works in which the effect of another ferrous
compound i.e. ferrous picrate catalyst (FPC) had been investigated
on fuel efficiency [352,383]. From the mechanism point of view, FPC
is decomposed before the fuel vaporization, releasing active iron
atoms into the combustion zone which prevent the formation of car-
bon deposits on engine walls [348,370,384]. This phenomenon leads
to decreased friction on the mentioned moving parts of the engine
and consequently decreases fuel consumption.

PVery recently, Mehta et alD

X. [375] also observed similar reduction
rates in fuel consumption as a result of the addition of iron, boron
and aluminum to diesel. They argued that the highest reduction rate
of 7% was obtained using Al. Such arguments were recently con-
firmed in a study conducted by Venkatesan and Kadiresh (2014)
who used the aqueous cerium and also by the study of Arockiasamy

Pand Anand (2015) in which Al2O3 and CeO2 were added into the neat
diesel [385,386]. They confirmed that cerium oxide oxidized the car-
bon deposits accumulated in the engine leading to efficient opera-
tion and reduced fuel consumption [385]. Fig. 7 presents the CeO2
nanoparticles [387]. Technically, nano-catalyst particles dispersed in
the fuel produce millions of nano-clusters whose explosion result in
the disintegration and decomposition of the deposits and prevent
their re-formation [351,388]. Similar to iron atoms, cerium oxide
also decreases friction on the moving parts of the engine and thus
decreases fuel consumption [351,388,389]. Beside the justification
mentioned above,
improving fuel consumption could also be
explained by the higher peak flame temperature and consequent
increased cylinder pressure as well as faster heat release rate in the
engine fuelled with diesel blended with homogeneous metallic cata-
lysts [364,369,382,390,391].

PIt is worth quoting that the presence of water in a diesel blend
containing metallic additives could be advantageous. For instance,
aluminum nanopowder when blended with water/diesel emulsion
fuel could react with water at higher temperatures and generate
hydrogen which could promote the combustion process in the

PIn comparison with neat biodiesel, the improvements reportedly
achieved in bsfc reduction have been remarkable when metal-based
additives were blended into biodiesel [352,355,364,368,394]. Results
of various investigations on B60-Mn, B60-Ni, B100-Al-mg, B60-Mg,
B100-Co, B25-Al, B83W15-Al and B60-Mo showed that all the men-
tioned blends reduced bsfc while the highest reduction rate was
obtained
biodiesel
[345,354,355,368,395-397]. Ganesh and Gowrishankar argued that
the improvement in the bsfc was due to the catalytic chemical oxida-
tion of fuel which in turn improved the fuel combustion [368]. In
contrast to these findings, Fangsuwannarak and Triratanasirichai
[356] did not observe favorable results when compared B5 and TiO2-
B5. More specifically, they reported 13% reduction in bsfc for B5 and
10% reduction for TiO2-B5, compared to neat diesel fuel. Their result
showed that the presence of TiO2 in biodiesel did not further
improve bsfc of the final blend (Table 10) [134].

PIn a study, Jelles and coworkers [353] in the year 2001 investi-
gated the application three metals-based fuel additives (i.e. copper,
iron, and cerium) with an after-treatment filter. Unlike iron and
cerium, the copper additive resulted in an increase in fuel consump-
tion by 5%. They pinpointed delayed combustion caused by the cop-
per additive as the main reason behind their observation [353].
Chlopek et alD
X. [398] also reported deteriorated bsfc as a result of the
addition of Mg additive into neat diesel but offered no further
explanations.

Pbte
PThe addition of the metallic additives could shorten the ignition
delay and combustion duration of diesel fuel in the engine, resulting
in slightly higher peak cylinder pressure and faster heat release rate
and consequently higher bte [379,385,390,394,401,404,405]. Zhu et
alD
X. (2012) reported that bte was increased by 0.8% at engine speeds
of 3600 rpm as a result of FPC addition into diesel with a dosing ratio
of 1:10,000, respectively [390]. In a different study, Kennan et alD
X.
(2011) claimed a remarkable improvement in bte (6.3%) using FeCl3
additive [352]. Similar reports are also available on the improving
effects of the other metallic additives blended with diesel fuel, such
as nanoparticles of Al and Mn [340,350,375,395(cid:1)397]. Such findings
could be explained by the impact of the metallic nanoparticles on
enhancing the calorific value of the fuel, promoting a complete com-
bustion due to higher evaporation rate, reducing the ignition delay,
higher flame temperatures, and prolonging flame sustenance [375].

PRecently, Venkatesan and Kadiresh (2014) investigated the com-
bustion of 50 ml/D
XL aqueous cerium oxide included in diesel and B15
and claimed an improved bte. Also, Arockiasamy and Anand [386] in
their study revealed that addition of 30 ppm alumina and cerium
oxide into biodiesel brought the bte value of biodiesel up to that of
neat diesel, while the former showed slightly better performance.
Similar results were also reported by Karthikeyan et alD
X. [401] who
investigated the addition of 50 and 100 ppm of cerium oxide into
B20 using a light duty diesel engine and achieved improved bte val-
ues. They attributed their achievement to the better combustion
characteristics and heat release rate of the blends caused by the
additive [385].

PIn a study, Ganesh et alD

X. (2011) used nano-metal based addi-
tives (Al-Mg and Co3O4) in neat biodiesel [368] and showed
slight increases in bte. An explanation for this improvement is
the behavior of Al-Mg particles [368]. Magnalium (AL-Mg) are
highly energetic material and burns during the combustion pro-
cess [368]. When exposing nanoparticle-laden fuel to high tem-
peratures, the substance would require a lower boiling point to
vaporize [406]. This is ascribed to the encapsulation of nanopar-
ticles by fuel droplets (Fig. 8) [368]. This at high temperatures
result in micro explosion of the fuel droplets and efficient atomi-
zation of the fuel [368].

PIt is worth quoting that the combustion conditions could play a
significant role in the impact of metallic additives. For instance,
Kannan et alD
X. [352] compared the catalytic effects of FBC at two dif-
ferent SOIs (standard operating value of 23° and advanced value of
25.5°) at 280 bar and found out that the additive was more effective
at the higher SOI investigated. More specifically, 1.8% and 3.1%
higher bte values were obtained in the presence of the additive for
the advanced SOI value compared to additive-containing diesel and
biodiesel at the standard operating condition (SOI of 23°). They con-
cluded that this improvement at higher injection pressure could
probably be due to proper mixing of fuel and air at increased pres-
sures, as well as enhanced combustion process caused by the pres-
ence of FBC. As a matter of fact, they highlighted the improved
X3 vs. 38.0, respec-
calorific value of FBC-B100 compared to B100 (38.D
tively) as the reason behind the enhanced combustion process
achieved. It is worth pointing out that they used FBC in inclusion

PIn general, metallic based additives have reducing effect on CO
emission (Table 9). For instance, Mehta et alD

investigation to study the combustion characteristics of a number
of metallic additives in diesel and found Fe2O3 and Al2O3

nano-particles in diesel, claiming a 21% reduction in CO emission
[370] owing to the improved brake specific fuel consumption effi-
ciency and increased combustion temperature at high engine
loads [370,379].

PBeside neat diesel, the positive effect of the inclusion of
metallic additives into biodiesel-diesel blend has also been
reported by several studies [340,355,407(cid:1)409]. For instance,
X. [350] reported that they achieved a 37% reduction in
Lenin et alD
CO emission by using 100 mg/D
XL of Mn compared to neat diesel.
Such rates of reduction have also been reported when additives
based on Mo and Mg (at rates between 4D
X and 12 mmol/L) were
included into biodiesel-diesel blends i.e. Mo-B60 and Mg-B60
X. [369] also used Mn and Mg (at two different
[345]. Keskin et alD
X) blended in diesel and showed
X and 16 mmol/LD
levels of 8 mmol/LD
that both Mn and Mg reduced the emitted CO at full load and
various speeds. Their findings were also supported by those of
other studies in which Mn or Mg were added into biodiesel-die-
sel blends [368,369,398]. These studies specified that the effec-
tiveness of Mn was slightly more than that of Mg, while pointing
out that in general further decreasing in CO emission happened
at lower engine speeds [369]. Addition of Al and Ce into the bio-
diesel-diesel blends has also been of interest in decreasing CO
emission [364,385,386,396,401]. Arockiasamy and Anand (2015)
compared CeO2-B100 and Al2O3-B100 (30 ppm) and achieved
20% reduction in CO emission [364]. This could be ascribed to
the oxygen donating characteristic of these metal oxides [364].
CO emission reduction was also reported recently by Venu and
Madhavan who investigated the addition of Zr and Ti into biodie-
sel-ether fuel blend [358].

PAdding metallic additives could improve fuel properties of bio-
diesel-diesel blends e.g. by reducing the pour point, viscosity and
increasing the flash point [134,395]. Some authors have also claimed
increased cetane number value of the fuel blends as a result of
metallic additives inclusion and have linked the reduction achieved
in CO emission to the higher cetane number of metal additive-diesel

P[369,377,398].
In line with these statements, Husnawan et alD
reported that the cetane number of B5containing 2% MgO was
increased in comparison with neat B5 and, subsequently led to
decreased CO emission [410].

PA number of studies looked into the impact of metallic additives
such as FeCl3, mangalium and Co3O4 when included into neat biodie-
sel (B100) and reported significant CO emission reduction compared
X.
to B100 [352,368]. A 52% CO reduction was observed by Kannan et alD
who combusted FeCl3-blended B100 [352] while Ganesh and Gow-
rishankar achieved around 50% reduction in emitted CO using Co3O4
[368]. They attributed their findings to reduced soot oxidation tem-
perature and also secondary atomization of fuel droplets caused by
the presence of metallic additives.

PLiang et alD

X. (2008) and Ganesh and Gowrishankar (2011) both
concluded that CO oxidation mechanism depends on two kinds of
oxygen species present on the surface of metallic oxides i.e. active
XIt is
oxygen (e.g. CoOx) and lattice oxygen (e.g. Co3O4) [368,411]. D
worth pointing out that thermal treatment could clearly affect the
mobility of active oxygen molecules. In better words, the higher the
temperature, the more mobile the active oxygen molecules become
[368,412], leading to more facilitated oxidation of CO [368]. Ganesh
and Gowrishankar (2011) argued that the lattice oxygen on the
Co3O4 is more active than the active oxygen and that it form an
intermediate i.e. bidentate carbonate, which could oxidize CO to pro-
duce CO2 (Fig. 9).

PIn an interesting study by Fangsuwannarak and Triratanasirichai
(2013), the amount of CO emission was reduced by more than 80% at
2000 rpm by using 0.2% TiO2 blended into neat diesel [356], but con-
trary to the findings of the above-mentioned reports, when B5 was
used instead of neat diesel in the blend, CO emission strongly
increased. They explained this phenomenon by the dominant pre-
mixed lean combustion resulted from the high oxygen content of
the blend originated from both the TiO2 and biodiesel [356].

PNOx emission
PAs mentioned earlier, metal additives could increase the cetane
number of diesel by about 1D
X(cid:1)1.2% and consequently could affect the
combustion process and emissions [369,377,398]. Fuels with a high
cetane number have smaller premixed fuel portions and lower NO

Pemissions for the same bmep compared to lower cetane numbered
fuels [340,350]. Jelles et alD
X. [353] reported 20% reduction in NOx
emission by using platinum/cerium additive in diesel fuel on a two
cylinder, direct injected, naturally-aspired diesel engine. Lenin et alD
X.
[350] obtained 4% NOx reduction by using 100 mg/LD
X Mn into neat
diesel and linked the reason of this reduction to the changes in the
cetane number of the blend [355]. The combustion results of alumi-
num-diesel also showed lower NOx than neat diesel at all loads and
the speed of 1800 rpm [369,413]. Some reports have also highlighted
that the presence of water in nanopowder metallic additives would
lead to micro-explosions in the emulsified fuel droplets which could
consequently result in NOx reduction [369,413].

PContrary to the reports in which metal additives have been cited
for their favorable impacts on NOx reduction, some have reported
otherwise i.e. increased NOx pollutants by using metal additives. For
instance, Ma et alD
X. (2013) observed NOx increases of 6.8% and 6.3%
for FTC-Diesel (1:3200) and FPC-Diesel (1:10,000) compared to the
reference diesel at 2800 rpm and 0.21 MPa BMEP [370]. Keskin et alD
X.
[369] reported that addition of 8 and 16 mmol/D
XL MnO2 and MgO cata-
lysts led to increased NOx production. These findings could be ratio-
nalized by considering the impact of metallic catalysts on increasing
flame temperature and cylinder pressure, which in turn could result
in more N2 contained in the combustion air being oxidized to NOx
during the combustion process [352,369,370,376,379]. Similar
results were also obtained by Mehta et alD
X. [375] who investigated
the combustion of 0.5 wt% nanoparticles of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 blended
into neat diesel.

PAs for biodiesel, a great portion of the existing literature argues
that NOx emission increases with increasing biodiesel proportion
due to its higher oxygen content [68,133]. The addition of metallic
additives (e.g. FeCl3, MgO, MoO2, Al-Mg, Al2O3, and Co3O4) into B100
could reportedly result in an effective reduction in NOx emission
[345,352,368,394,396,397,401]. Cerium oxide has
also been
highlighted for its positive effect when blended into biodiesel where
an average of around 30% NOx reduction was achieved at a dosing
level of 80 ppm CeO2 nanoparticles [403]. Vankatesan et alD
X. [385],
who used an aqueous solution of cerium oxide nanoparticle in B15
and neat diesel, argued that the high latent heat of evaporation of
water and its high thermal capacity also played a role in reducing
the temperature of the combustion chamber which led to dimin-
ished nitrogen oxide production [385]. In an earlier study, Keskin et
X. [355] used a single cylinder, DI diesel engine with air cooling sys-
alD
tem to study the effect of MnO2 and NiO (8 and 12 mmol/D
XL) on the
exhausted emissions and found that the combustion of B60-Mn and
B60-Ni lowered NOx in comparison with neat diesel. They also
reported that Mn showed a better performance than Ni, probably
owing to the higher catalytic effect of the Mn additives [355].

PSuch findings have raised hope for a solution to adverse effects of
biodiesel on NOx when blended into diesel [345,368,403]. However,
there are a few investigations whose findings contrast these promis-
X. [364] and Fangsuwan-
ing achievements. For instance, Selvan et alD
narak and Triratanasirichai [356] claimed that the addition of
cerium oxide and titanium oxide into biodiesel-diesel blends led to
increased NOx emissions but offered no explanations. In a different
study Kannan et alD
X. [352] also observed increased NOx emission as a
result of including FBC into biodiesel-diesel blends and attributed
their observation to the impact of FBC through oxidization of the N2
into NOx during the combustion process.

PHC emission
PThe existing literature is unanimous concerning the positive
effect of metallic additive on emitted HC. In a recent study on nano-
emulsions of Fe (Fe2O3), Al (Al2O) and B (B2O3) blended into diesel
fuel using a single-cylinder CI engine at different loads, Mehta et alD
X.
(2014) revealed that Fe and Al decreased HC emission whereas B led
to no significant variations compared to diesel fuel [375]. They
argued that the second stage of combustion promoted micro-

Pexplosion of nano-fuels droplets and led to rises in cylinder pressure
and temperature resulting in a more complete combustion [375].
Addition of FTC and FPC into diesel fuel has also been shown to exert
reducing effects on HC emissions by up to 12% [370]. Chlopek et alD
X.
(2005),  ̧Celik et alD
X. (2015) obtained similar
result in their combustion experiments using Mg-diesel, Mn-diesel,
TiO2 and Ag-diesel emulsions
respectively [376,378,379,398].
Improved bsfc efficiency and increased combustion temperature at
high engine loads are two major reasons offered in some reported
for HC emission reduction when Fe-based catalysts were applied as
additive in diesel fuel in forms of FeCl3, FTC and FPC [352,370].

X. (2015) and Saraee et alD

PPromising HC reduction rates were also achieved when metallic
additives were investigated in biodiesel. An average HC emission
reduction of 40% has been reported for dosing levels of around
80 ppm of CeO2 compared to neat biodiesel [364,403]. Similar results
XL was included in
were obtained when FeCl3 at a dosage of 20 mmol/D
X. (2009) showed
biodiesel [352]. In an interesting study, Selvan et alD
that cerium oxide addition led to lower HC emissions when used in
neat diesel and/or ethanol-biodiesel-diesel compared to their cata-
lyst-free counterparts. It is obvious that the impact of cerium oxide
in ethanol-biodiesel-diesel in terms of lowering HC emission was
less significant than in Ce-diesel blend due to the decreasing effect
of oxygenated additives on HC emission [364]. Cerium oxide leads to
the oxidation (burn off) of carbon deposits within the engine cylin-
der preventing the deposition of non-polar compounds on the cylin-
der wall which results in reduced HC emissions [364]. In a very
recent study, Mirzajanzadeh and coworkers [351] introduced a novel
soluble hybrid nano-catalyst as a promising combustion improver.
The hybrid nano-catalyst containing cerium oxide on amide-func-
tionalized MWCNT (CeO2-MWCNTs) led to high rates of HC reduc-
tion (71.4%). They attributed their achievement to the high surface
area of the soluble nano-sized catalyst particles and their proper dis-
tribution along with catalytic oxidation reaction which resulted in
significant overall improvements in the combustion reaction spe-
cially in B20 containing 90 ppm of the catalyst [414]. Their findings
were in line with those of previous studies in which aqueous cerium
oxide was used in biodiesel-diesel blends [385,401].

PPM emission
PThe positive influence of metal-based additives on the emit-
ted PM has been frequently reported [348,355,370,398,400,
413,415] . PM emission has been reportedly dramatically sup-
pressed by the addition of FTC/FPC catalysts to diesel under dif-
ferent test conditions [348,370,400]. For instance, Ma et alD
X.
(2013) reported that the addition of FPC to diesel led to 39.5%
reduction in emitted PM [348]. These significant PM emission
reductions could be attributed to the enhanced combustion effi-
ciency by the application of these catalysts (i.e. FTC and FPC)
[348,370,400,413]. To justify these findings, Kim et alD
X. argued
that the ferrocene contained in the structure of these catalysts
decomposes early forming a fine aerosol which subsequently

Preacts with the deposited carbons leading to their oxidation and
consequent reduced PM emission by over 60% [415].

PAddition of metallic additives into biodiesel-diesel blends have
also been reported to result in lower PM emissions [355,398]. Keskin
et alD
X. claimed that the combustion of B60-Mn diminished PM emis-
sion by up to 30% compared to diesel fuel at 2400 rpm and full load
condition [355]. Similar results had been achieved by Valentine et alD
X.
in the year 2000 as well [354].

PZhang et alD

X. [348] investigated an iron-based catalyst blended
with diesel with a focus on the impact of the additive on particle
size distribution of soot. In fact, the size of the PM particles is one of
the important parameters when PM emissions are investigated
[416]. Their findings revealed a remarkable reduction of between 7.3D
and 39.5% in soot emissions. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
also confirmed higher oxidation reactivities (as indicated by lower
ignition temperatures and faster oxidation rates [285]) in the pres-
ence of the catalyst [348,417]. However, they reported that the
metallic additive reduced larger soot particles more substantially
than smaller ones [348].

P2.2.2. Carbon nanotubes (CNT)

PCombustion-improving potentials of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in a
base fluid are attributed to the enhanced surface-area-to-volume
ratio and settling time [418]. Among different types of CNTs, multi-
walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) which consist of multiple
rolled layers of graphene are of greater interest [419]. This is
ascribed to the multiple advantages of MWNTs over single-walled
carbon nanotube (SWCNTs), i.e., ease of mass production, low prod-
uct cost per unit, and enhanced thermal and chemical stability [419].
However, MWNTs have not been well-defined yet due to their struc-
tural complexity and varieties when compared to SWCNTs [419]. It
is worth quoting that the intrinsic properties of CNTs can be pre-
served by the surface modification of MWCNTs, where the outer
wall of MWCNTs is exposed to chemical modifiers [419]. CNTs have
been recently introduced as a potential nano-additive for fuels for
improving engine performance and reducing exhausted engine gases
[418,420,421]. It has been reported that these carbon-based addi-
tives could improve fuel’s cetane number by enhancing the burning
rate, and acting as an anti-knock agent which in turn could result in
cleaner burning of the fuel by suppressing the smoke formation
[418,422].

P2.2.2.1. The effect of CNT additives on engine performance.

bsfc
PCNTs have been found to exert positive effects on bsfc when
included in biodiesel-diesel blends (Table 11). For instance, Balaji
and Cheralathan [423] investigated the addition of CNTs (100-
300 ppm) into biodiesel and achieved bsfc reductions compared to
its additive-free counterpart. Similar results were also obtained by
Senthilkumar and Prabu who investigated the addition of MWCNTs
(50, 100 and 150 ppm) in a water-diesel (D80W20) emulsion [419].
Such bsfc reduction achieved could be explained by the reduced
excess fuel burning in the premixed phase caused by reduced igni-
tion delay [419,424,425]. Basha and Anand [421] also studied CNTs
blended water-diesel emulsion fuels but highlighted the CNTs-
driven intensification of the micro-explosion as the main reason for
the improved bsfc achieved compared to that of additive-free water-
diesel emulsion fuel. The reduction in bsfc may also be due to the
positive effects of the nanocarbon additive on the physicochemical
properties of the fuel such as increasing viscosity, calorific value, and
cetane number [423]. Overall, the bsfc improvements have been
found proportional to the concentration of the CNTs in the fuel
[418,420,425].

Pbte
PThe bte could be influenced by the physicochemical properties of
fuels and as mentioned earlier, CNTs could improve these

Pparameters [422,423]. Balaji and Cheralathan [423] in a very recent
study investigated the addition of CNTs (100, 200, and 300 ppm)
into neat biodiesel [423] and achieved bte increases of 2.12%, 4.17%,
and 3.43% for B100CNT100, B100CNT200, and B100CNT300 blends, respec-
tively, compared to neat biodiesel at full load condition [423]. Their
findings were in line with those of an earlier study by Selvan et alD
(2014) who investigated lower concentrations of CNTs (i.e., 25, 50,
and 100 ppm) in a D70B10E20 fuel blend [426]. Moreover, Balaji and
Cheralathan [423] argued that increasing additive concentration up
to 200 ppm in B100 increased the bte value but the improving
impacts were lessened at concentrations beyond that [423]. They
also attributed the positive effects achieved to the changes in the
physical properties of the fuel (i.e., increased kinematic viscosity and
cetane) as well as the decreased ignition delay time [423,426].

PIn different studies, Basha and Anand (2011) and Senthilkumar
and Prabu (2015) reported improved bte values particularly at
higher loads as a result of the addition of CNTs into water-diesel
emulsions [419,421]. These increases in bte could be probably
explained by the high surface area to volume ratio of CNTs or in bet-
ter words, the highly reactive surfaces of CNTs leading to their effec-
tive participation in the combustion process [419,421,425].
In
addition, the CNTs-driven intensification of the micro-explosion and
secondary atomization could also be considered as reason behind
the improved bte of the CNT blended water-diesel emulsion fuels
[421].

P2.2.2.2. The effect of CNT additives on engine emissions.

CO emission
PBalaji and Cheralathan [423] managed to significantly reduce CO
emission by 8.56%, 16.16%, and 11.77% using B100CNT100, B100CNT200,
and B100CNT300 blends, respectively, compared to neat biodiesel at
full load condition. Similar results were also observed by Tewari et
alD
X. who reported lower emitted CO compared to B100 when com-
busting MWCNTs-B100 (25 and 50 ppm) [427]. They indicated that
the reduction in CO emission may be due to shorter ignition delay
and the improved ignition characteristics of the CNTs-harboring fuel
[427]. The high catalytic activity of CNTs due to their high surface to
volume ratio could be regarded as the driving factors in improving
the ignition characteristics of the fuel [423,426].

PThe CO emitted through the combustion of CNTs blended water-
diesel emulsion fuels was also lower compared to that of neat diesel
[419,421]. Moreover, Senthilkumar and Prabu [419] claimed that
higher CO reduction rates could be achieved by increasing the con-
centration of CNTs in the water-diesel emulsion fuels. Such findings
could be justified by the intensified secondary atomization phenom-
enon caused by the encapsulated CNTs water droplets in the com-
bustion chamber. This in turn leads more uniform dispersion of fuel
particles and consequently more efficient reaction with the available
air in the engine cylinder [419,421].

PNOx emission
PThe impacts of CNTs addition into different fuel blends have
been controversial. For instance, Balaji and Cheralathan [423]
reported decreased NOx emissions in response to the addition of
CNTs to B100 proportional to the additive concentration in fuel
[423]. More specifically, they managed to reduce NOx emission
by 2.88%, 7.25%, and 4.67% using 100, 200, and 300 ppm CNTs,
respectively, compared to neat biodiesel at full load condition
[423]. In order to justify their findings, they indicated that the
additive shortened the ignition delay which in turn retarded the
increasing rate of cylinder peak pressure [419,423]. In contrast,
Tewari et alD
X. reported that the inclusion of MWCNTs (25 and
50 ppm) into B100 increased the produced NOx emission in com-
parison with the additive-free B100 [427]. They linked their find-
ings to increased ignition delay which in turn resulted in higher
premixed combustion fraction and higher peak temperatures
observed [426].

PIn case of water-diesel emulsion fuel, the magnitude of NOx emis-
sion is comparatively lower than that of neat diesel due to the heat
sink effect caused by the water droplets in the emulsion [419,421].
Furthermore, the CNTs blended water-diesel emulsion fuels pro-
duced lower NOx emissions compared to that of additive-free water-
diesel emulsion fuel due to lower combustion temperature
[419,421].

PHC emission
PThe addition of CNTs has been shown to decrease HC emissions
[418,420,423]. Balaji and Cheralathan [423] achieved decreased HC
emission by 3.67%, 10.39%, and 8.15% in response to increasing con-
centrations of CNTs in B100 (100, 200, and 300 ppm, respectively)
load condition [423]. The
compared to neat biodiesel at full
unburned HC emissions have also been found lower for the CNTs
blended water-diesel emulsion fuels than the water-diesel emulsion
fuel [418,420,421,425]. This could be attributed to the catalytic
activity and improved combustion characteristics of CNTs [419,421].

PPM emission
PThe few studies which have investigated on the combustion of
CNTs blended into biodiesel-diesel have not specifically survey the
PM variations and instead considered smoke opacity value of the
exhausted gas. The level of smoke opacity for the CNTs blended
water-biodiesel-diesel emulsion fuels is comparatively less than
that of water-biodiesel-diesel blend and neat diesel [418,420,425].
This is ascribed to the shorter ignition delay characteristics of the
CNTs blended water-diesel emulsion fuels. More specifically, as a
result of the shortened ignition delay, a sufficient amount fuel is
injected into the combustion chamber prior to the ignition leading
to an enhancement in air-fuel mixing [418].

PThe final destination of additives including CNTs because of their
potentially harmful impacts on human health is also of crucial
importance. CNTs have been reportedly caused lung inflammation
when inhaled [372]. For instance, Jung et alD
X. [428] investigated on
the characterization of the PMs found in diesel and confirmed the
presence of CNTs in the exhausted gas but could not accurately iden-
tify the main resource of this pollutant. They suggested that the
resources of such contaminants could be the CNTs included to fuel
as additive, iron-containing compounds used as fuel-borne catalyst
for diesel in the Europe, and antiknock additives used in some coun-
tries [347,429]. Jung et alD
X. suggested that further work should be
done to better understand the origin and prevalence of CNTs in die-
sel emissions [428] (Table. 8).

2.3. Water

P2.3.1. Various strategies used for adding water

PAt the end of the last century, addition of water into diesel engine
was introduced as a method to reduce engine emissions [430]. The
original aim of adding water was to reduce local combustion tem-
perature in the ignition chamber and to consequently reduce NOx
emission. There are three practical means for inducing water into
the engine cylinder, i.e., water fumigation (WF) into the intake mani-
fold, water-diesel emulsion (WDE), direct water injection (DWI) into
the combustion chamber (using a common or a separate injector)
(Fig. 10) [9,431(cid:1)434]. A review of published papers reveals that
each method has some advantages and drawbacks which have been
briefly discussed in this manuscript.

PWater-diesel emulsion (WDE) strategy
PWDE is defined as an emulsion of water in standard diesel fuel by
using specific additives and surfactants to stabilize the system [437].
Such emulsion could be prepared in two phases (oil-in-water (O/W),
or water-in-oil (W/O)) [438] or three phases (oil-in-water-in-oil (O/
W/O)) [439,440]. By increasing the percentage of water in the emul-
sion, WDE generally results in the simultaneous reduction of NOx,
PM and soot emissions but increase of CO2 and HC emissions. [437].
The improving impacts caused by the presence of water in oil could

Pbe explained by the micro-explosion phenomenon leading to better
atomization of emulsion. This phenomena takes place when the vol-
atility values of water and fuel are different leading to a subsequent
enhanced mixing rate of fuel with the surrounding air [9]. The effect
of water in reducing NOx emission is ascribed to the thermal, dilu-
tion and chemical effects [441]. On the other hand and despite of the
above-mentioned advantages, the impact of water on decreasing the
combustion temperature could also bring about some disadvantages.
More specifically, lowering the temperature too early during the
combustion process could lead to increased ignition delay, engine
noise, and consequently increased maintenance cost of the engine
[434]. Moreover, the properties of the water-diesel emulsion are dif-
ferent from those of diesel fuel. Changes in these properties such as
viscosity and density could significantly affect the combustion qual-
ity, cold start conditions and durability of engine [434,441]. Stability
of water/oil emulsions is also one of the challenges faced and surfac-
tants are essentially used to stabilize the emulsion. The hydrophilic-
lipophilic balance (HLB) of surfactants plays a key role in maximizing
the stability of water/oil emulsions. Porras et alD
X. [80] reported that
the optimum water/diesel microemulsion occurs in the HLB range of
X(cid:1)12.
8D

PDirect water injection (DWI) strategy
PIn the DWI method, water is injected in the engine cylinder sepa-
rately or mixed with the fuel. An electronic control unit controls the
pump that delivers measured volumes of water to an electronic
injector. Unlike the WDE, the fuel to water ratio could be changed
easily for cold start or different operating conditions by using the
DWI [436]. Moreover, by controlling the amount of water injected,
its adverse effects on the ignition delay could be minimized [9]. But
this method requires the addition of complex equipment to the
existing engine [441].

PWater fumigation (WF) into the intake manifold strategy
PWater fumigation in the manifold is probably the easiest way to add
water into the diesel engine. In this method, supplying water is per-
formed uniformly by several strategies, e.g., downstream the compres-
sor or multipoint fumigation in the intake pipes close to the inlet valves
[436]. In all cases, the water/fuel ratio could be increased up to 50%.
The method has been mostly investigated using marine diesel engines
[442]. It has been reported that a high water mass to fuel ratio (about
65%) was necessary to obtain 50% NOx reduction using this strategy
[436,441]. However, dynamic light scattering analyses have revealed
that by increasing water concentration in fuel, the droplet size increases
as well which lessens the improving impacts of water [443].

P2.3.2. The effect of water on engine performance

Pbsfc
PThe bsfc of the emulsion fuels is higher than that of neat diesel
because of the lower heating value of the emulsion fuel [444(cid:1)447].
Fahd et alD
X. [446] reported a similar bsfc variation trend for water-
diesel emulsion to that of diesel, i.e., at all load conditions, the bsfc
of water-diesel emulsion decreased initially as the engine speed
increased, and reached a minimum value but started to increase
again. However, at lower engine speeds, the frictional loss and the
heat transfer to the combustion chamber wall was proportionately
greater which resulted in higher fuel consumption for the desired
power output compared to neat diesel and also at higher engine
speeds frictional power significantly increased, leading to higher
fuel consumption [446,448,449]. It is evident that by increasing the
water content, bsfc increases dramatically as a large amount of die-
sel is displaced by an equal amount of water (Table 12) [450(cid:1)452].
In a study by Liang et alD
X. [453], the maximum bsfc was found 12%
higher than that of neat diesel when water content in the diesel was

XD, Bu, E, and prp stand for diesel, buthanol, ethanol, and propanol, respectively.

PAbdullah [433] claimed that increasing water concentration in bio-
diesel emulsions from 5 to 15% increased bsfc by 7.2% at 2800 rpm
while no statistically significant differences were observed in bsfc
values of water-biodiesel-diesel [433].

PContrary to the above-mentioned reports, there are a number of
studies which have claimed improved bsfc values as a result of water
X. (2013)
inclusion in fuel blends. For instance, Debnath Debnath et alD
showed that the bsfc of a 5% water-biodiesel emulsion was reduced
by 11% and 2% compared with neat biodiesel and diesel, respectively
[454]. Their findings were in agreement with those of Davis et alD
X.
(2012) who compared B20 and 10% water-B20 emulsion and
reported that sfc was significantly reduced as a result of water inclu-
sion in the fuel blend [455]. Similar results were also reported by
X. [106] where the bsfc of a diesel fuel containing 20% oxy-
Chang et alD
genated additive (acetone-butanol-ethanol) was
improved by
increasing the water concentration from 0.5% to 2.5% [106].

PLin and Chen [440] investigated the effect of emulsification
method on fuel consumption and they found that the W/O and O/W/
O emulsions prepared by the mechanical homogenizer appeared to
have higher bsfc values than those prepared by the ultrasonic vibra-
tor. That is primarily due to the smaller size of water droplets in the
dispersed phase and the more even water-droplet distribution in the
emulsions prepared by the [440].

PAs mentioned earlier, apart from adding water through the prep-
aration of water-fuel emulsions (i.e., WDE), water could also be
X. [9]
added through fumigation into the intake manifold. Sahin et alD
reported a small increase in bsfc by water fumigation into the inlet
manifold when compared with neat diesel at some loads and at
2000 and 2500 rpm but at 3500 rpm and at all loads, bsfc decreased
by approximately 4%. They concluded that overall water fumigation
into intake air does not result in any significant changed in the bsfc
of the engine at all loads and speeds [9,432].

PGenerally, bsfc is not ideal at low and high engine speeds. This
can be explained based on the fact that at low speeds, the heat loss
through the combustion chamber walls is proportionally greater and
the combustion efficiency is poorer while at higher speeds, the
power required to overcome friction increases at a higher rate,
resulting in a slower increase in output power with a consequent
increase in bsfc [432,439,448]. Therefore, the minimum bsfc takes
place some where between the lowest and highest engine speeds. It
has been reported that by fumigating water into the intake manifold,
bsfc was slightly higher compared with the condition where no
water was added [432,445]. This could be ascribed to the impact of
water on increasing heat loss at low engine speeds.

PIn a pioneer study Bedford et alD

X. (2000) investigated DWI and
reported that at 44% of the maximal load, the sfc was improved by
direct injection of 23% water into the cylinder [434]. Later in 2009,
Sarvi et alD
X. [456] also strived to look into the impact of DWI but
X.
achieved inverse results compared with those of Bedford et alD
(2000). It is however unfortunate that it is not rationally justified to
try to draw any conclusions by comparing the results of these study
as they have reported the impact of DWI on fuel consumption using
different indexes, i.e., sfc and bsfc.

Pbte
PVarious studies investigated on the addition of water into diesel
revealed that the combustion of water-diesel (or diesel containing
oxygenated additives such as biodiesel) enjoys a greater thermody-
namic efficiency than standard diesel [439,448,453]. This could be
explained by the fact that full combustion of a fuel requires in excess
the amount of stoichiometric oxygen and that the stoichiometric
oxygen content is not generally enough for a full combustion pro-
cess. In another word, increasing the structural oxygen content of
fuel results in enhanced combustion efficiency (CE) of the fuel due to
an increase in the homogeneity of oxygen with the fuel during

Pcombustion. Similarly, the CE of biodiesel is bigger than that of
petroleum diesel and hence, the cetane number of biodiesel is also
higher than that of diesel fuel. A good hypothesis for the bte
improvements achieved by using biodiesel-diesel blends containing

Pwater could be made by highlighting the impact of water vapors
formed during combustion leading to lower heating values (net
heating value). It should be noted that the heat loss caused by the
evaporation of each gram water is approximately 539 cal or 2256 J.

overall 11% higher bte by using (5% water)-biodiesel compared with
neat diesel. In a different study, Fahd et alD
X. (2013) managed to
improve the bte value of an ethanol-biodiesel emulsion by adding
water mainly at high power outputs [446,460]. Chang et alD
X. (2013)
also reported that adding 0.5% water to the 20% oxygenated additive
(acetone-butanol-ethanol)-diesel blend could improve the bte value

Pupto 3.26 and 8.56% compared with the additive-free blend and die-
sel fuel, respectively [106]. The aboveD
X-mentioned increase in energy
efficiency may be caused by the micro-explosions, which enhance
the fuel atomization resulting in better combustion [106,439]. Chang
et alD
X. also reported that the improvements in bte at high loads are
greater than those at low loads and justified this by the high latent
heat of vaporization of water in the blend which inhibited ignition
and significantly delayed the combustion process by releasing the

P[435] used an emulsion fuel consisting of (v/v) 82.4% diesel, 5%
water, and 12.6% nano-organic additive (including glycerin and poly-
ethoxy-ester). Their findings revealed that the emulsion fuel had a
higher bte than neat diesel [435]. They linked this improvement to
the induction of more oxygenated additives and reduced viscosity
[435]. Their result is in agreement with those of the previous studies
that suggested that emulsion fuels with around 5% water concentra-
tion could improve the efficiency of the engine at high load condi-
tions, while the efficiency was deteriorated when the engine was
operated at low load conditions [10,435,446]. In an effort to justify
the combustion-improving impact of water inclusion in diesel fuel,
Yang et alD
X. highlighted shorter combustion duration and higher heat
release rate of the water-oxygenated additive-diesel emulsion fuel
compared with neat diesel [233,435]. More specifically, they indi-
cated that the micro-explosion of the water droplets could acceler-
ate the combustion process and consequently cause a more efficient
and complete combustion process [233,435].

PIn contrast to the above studies, fueling 10% water-diesel and 10%
water-B20 emulsions into a single cylinder diesel engine (4.8 kW)
conducted by Davis et alD
X. [455] led to a reduction in thermal effi-
ciency in comparison with neat diesel. The magnitude of this relative
Xto 11% for water(cid:1)diesel and from 11D
decrease was reportedly from 5D
to 27% for water(cid:1)B20 [455]. This reduction could be attributed to
the excessive cooling of the engine [455,458]. Investigations into
using water as emulsion in diesel fuel has not been limited to low
amounts of water, and positive impacts of large amounts of water in
diesel emulsion on bte has also been reported [446,450,460]. In con-
tract to these reports, however, Subramanian [458] claimed that 40%
water-diesel emulsion slightly lowered the bte value compared with
the bte value achieved for neat diesel fuel. The author linked this
finding to the prolonged premixed combustion phase caused by the
high latent heat of vaporization of water [458].

PStudying bte at different engine speeds showed that at low
engine speeds, thermal efficiency is low for the water-diesel emul-
sion and this is due to heat losses to cylinder wall [446,465,466]. As
the engine speed increases, the thermal efficiency also increases up
to a maximum value [446] but further increasing of the engine speed
causes the thermal efficiency to drop mainly because of higher fric-
tional losses [446].

POne of the problems associated with the application of water in
diesel is the cold start condition of engine. Cold-start may be impos-
sible with the WDE and therefore, the injection system should be
purged before engine stop in order to have neat diesel fuel in the
injection system for the subsequent engine start [459].

PStudying the impacts of engine load when using water in diesel,
X. [432] argued that at lower engine speeds, the engine run-
Tesfa et alD
ning with water injection has slightly higher cumulative heat release
rate than the engine running without water injection. More specifi-
cally, they stated that at low loads, the engine bte corresponding to
3 kg/h water injection decreased by 3% compared to the bte of the
X210 Nm and
engine running without water [432]. At higher loads (D
X420 Nm), the thermal efficiency of the engine running with water
injection was slightly higher as compared with no water injection
condition [432]. The bte improvements achieved in response to
water injection could also justified by short combustion duration
and higher cylinder pressure caused by the addition of water into
the chamber [442].

P2.3.3. The effect of water on engine emissions

PCO emission
PVariations in emitted CO pollutant as a result of water inclusion
into diesel fuel has been investigated by a number of research works
[10,106,433,446,457]. Lin and Lin (2007) and Fahd et alD
X. (2013) both
reported that 10% water included into diesel emulsions led to
increased CO emissions except at higher engine speeds and at a par-
X. [449]
ticular load [445,446]. In a very recent study, Ithnin et alD

Pinvestigated the impact of water inclusion (5-20%) into diesel and
observed an increase in CO emission for at all conditions compared
to neat diesel. Their findings were consistent with those of Koc and
Abdullah (2013) and Yang et alD
X. (2013) who also found out that CO
generation was proportional to the amount of water added into die-
sel fuel and that water concentrations lower than 5% did not remark-
ably increase CO emission [433,435]. They attributed their findings
X1 and consequent availability of sufficient
to the air to fuel ratio of >D
amount of oxygen for complete combustion of the fuel [433,435].
Overall, CO generation generally increases in response to water addi-
tion into diesel. In fact, the high latent heat of vaporization of water
can be responsible for the poor oxidation reaction rate of carbon
In
monoxide and increased CO emission production [446,461].
another word, incomplete combustion or combustion deterioration
caused by the presence of water leads to higher CO levels [106].

PIt is worth quoting that similar to neat diesel, the production
of CO emission of the water-diesel emulsions varies proportional
to the engine load. More specifically, from no load condition to
50% load, the formation of CO is reduced drastically and it then
slowly increases at higher engine loads [446,447]. This is
ascribed to the fact that in the low load state, there is not suffi-
cient temperature to convert the CO to CO2 [449] while by
increasing the load and subsequently the cylinder temperature
the conversion rate increases significantly. On the other hand,
high CO occurrences at high loads are due to the lack of oxygen
inside the jet core, in the fuel impinged on the walls, and at the
end portion of the injected fuel [449].

PWater inclusion in various blends of biodiesel-diesel has also
been investigated but reportedly led to decreased CO emission in
some studies [106,433,440,454,455]. For instance, Debnath et alD
X.
[454] reported that a 5% water(cid:1)biodiesel emulsion caused 43% and
67% reduction of CO emission compared with neat biodiesel and
neat diesel, respectively. They attributed the reductions achieved to
the higher oxygen content of biodiesel and also the micro-explosion
phenomenon due to the presence of water which led to a larger
degree of mixing of the reactants [454]. In an interesting study, Lin
and Chen [440] argued that the type of emulsion could also influence
on the emitted CO, and their results showed that two-phase W/O
emulsions produced less CO emission than the O/W/O emulsions.
This could be justified by the more intense heat release rate and
thus, a higher burning gas temperature [440].

PThe combined effects of engine type (high and light duty diesel
engines) and water inclusion in diesel fuel were taken into account
by Farfaletti et alD
X. [464]. They reported a significant decline in CO
emissions (by 32%) for the high duty diesel engine when fueled with
water-diesel emulsion, but in contrast, the light duty led to 18%
higher CO emission. Unfortunately, the authors offered no explana-
tion concerning the findings achieved. The different effect of emul-
sions for the LD vehicles as compared to the HD engine is interesting
and may simply be due to the use of different injection systems (unit
injector, common rail vs unit pump.

PThe strategy used for adding water into diesel has also been found
effective on CO emission. For instance, Subramanian (2011) compared
the WF and WDE in terms of their impacts of the emitted CO by con-
sidering the same amount of water and at low loads and found that
X. (2012)
the WF led to less CO emission that the WDE [458]. Tesfa et alD
strived to investigate the impact of water flow rate (1.8 and 3 kg/h) on
the CO emission and argued that the higher flow rate increased the CO
emission at all operating conditions [432]. Two hypothesis could be
considered for explaining their findings, 1) the reduction of the pre-
combustion temperature due to higher rate of water injection which
must have in turn slowed the chemical conversion of the CO to CO2, 2)
higher water vapor at high temperatures and consequent reaction
with the solid carbon which could result in an increased formation of
CO and H2O in the cylinder [432]. They also reported that when the
engine speed and load increased, the CO emission decreased [432].

PThis could be ascribed to the fact that at higher engine speeds,
the air/fuel equivalence ratio increases and this could result in
an increase in the in-cylinder gas temperature, which leads to an
increase in the kinetic reaction rate of the CO to CO2 conversion
X. [467]
[432]. Similar results were also reported by Kukkuluk et alD
who recorded an increased CO emission at all engine speeds
when 20% water was fumigated into the diesel engine. Their
results were in line with those of the previous studies based on
which increasing the WF ratio to diesel fuel was considered as
the cause of the increased CO emissions recorded [436,468].

POverall, water inclusion into diesel engines has been found to
result in increased CO emissions in most studies. However, in an
investigation, Sarvi et alD
X. [456] claimed that the by using the DWI
(through a nozzle allowing the injection of water and fuel oil into
the cylinder) CO emission was reduced by approximately 10% but
they failed to offer any justifications for their observations.

PNOx emission
PThe major aim of adding water into diesel engine is for lower-
ing emitted NOx. A number of studies have shown that NOx
emission was tangibly lower using water-diesel emulsion fuel
compared with neat diesel for all engine speeds tested (Tables
12 and D
X. [10] reported that in com-
parison with neat diesel, inclusion of 15% water at 3200 rpm and
full load conditions could diminish 30% of the exhausted NOx.

reported an average NOx emission reduction of 41% during the
combustion of an emulsion of 20% water and diesel
fuel
[439,449]. Many researchers have attributed the NOx-reducing
effect of water in water-diesel emulsion fuels to the lower peak
temperature of the flame during combustion which prevents the
NOx
[394,447,450,
464,469(cid:1)472]. In fact, this reduction in the flame temperature is
caused by the high latent heat of evaporation of water, an endo-
thermic
combustion
[459,473]. In addition, it is worth quoting that the percentage of
NOx reduction is almost directly proportional to the percentage
of water content in the water-diesel emulsion [449].

PLif et alD

X. (2010) investigated on the water-diesel emulsion of two
X(cid:1)Tropsch (FT) diesel and ULSD,
different types of diesel fuel, FischerD
and found that the water-FT diesel emulsion led to lower NOx emission
[461]. The difference observed could be ascribed to the different physi-
cochemical properties of the different diesel fuels, i.e., higher flash
point of the water-FT (96 °C) compared with the water-ULSD (78 °C).

PIn addition, combustion conditions could also exert some impacts
on the NOx-reducing effect of water in water-diesel emulsions. More
specifically, at low loads the NOx-reducing effect is higher while and
it lessens by increasing load [331,461]. Injection pressure was also
found effective by Maiboom and Tauzia [459] on NOx emission in
the presence of water. They highlighted that at low injection pres-
sure (392D
X(cid:1)869 bar) NOx emission was constantly reduced by
30D
X(cid:1)50% for water-diesel emulsions compared with neat diesel fuel.
This can be explained by the flame temperature reduction caused by
water evaporation, thermal dilution with water, and combustion
off-phasing. On the contrary, when they applied high injection pres-
sure, NOx emission was increased by up to 24% with the water-diesel
emulsions compared to neat diesel, due to faster combustion [459].

minor reduction in NOx emissions (¡D
X6%) using a high duty diesel
engine fueled by 6% water-diesel emulsion, while the NOx reduction
for light duty diesel engine was insignificant.

PThe impact of water inclusion into diesel in the presence of oxy-
genated additives has also been investigated by many researchers.
For instance, Davis et alD
X. [455] argued that a 10% water-diesel emul-
sion resulted in similar NOx emission to that of neat diesel, while the
emulsions of 10% water-B20 and 10% water-B100 reduced NOx pol-
lutant significantly in comparison with neat diesel. In fact, the posi-
tive effects of water-biodiesel emulsions have been observed in
numerous studies. Koc and abdullah in the year 2013 using a light
duty 4-cylinder diesel engine showed that the average amount of
NOx reduction measured for 5% water-B20 was 7.9% compared to
B20 [433]. In a different study, Debnath et alD
X. [454,460], compared
B100 and 5% water-B100 emulsion and claimed that water inclusion

Preduced NOx upto 20% and 63% compared with B100 and neat diesel,
respectively. Kumar and Jaikumar achieved a high rate of NOx emis-
X24%) by using a water-ethanol-biodiesel emulsion
sion reduction (¡D
(15, 10, and 70%, respectively, with 5% surfactant) [233]. They sug-
gested the presence of water and its high latent heat of vaporization
as the main reason for their findings [233]. Lee et alD
X. tested water-
containing ethanol blended into biodiesel-diesel at different ratios
and recorded an average reduction of 5% in NOx emission compared
to neat diesel. They attributed the improvement achieved to the fact
that the blends containing the water-containing ethanol had lower
cetane index and heating values. This resulted in to an ignition delay
and accumulation of the fuel-air mixture before combustion leading
to lower NOx emissions [331].

PSpraying water into the inlet manifold has also been found as
effective as the application of water-diesel emulsions. Sahin et alD
X. [9]
reported that the NOx emission decreased by 10% with increasing the
Xm
amount of sprayed water (0-20%) at 2000D
engine speeds and loads. It is worth quoting that the formation of NOx
emission is strongly dependent on the combustion temperature. The
presence of water vapor declines the combustion temperature or in
another word increases the specific heat of the intake charge which in
turn results in lower NOx emission [106,436,458-460,468,469,474]. In
addition to this justification, the addition of water into the air charge
reduces the concentration of oxygen per unit volume or mass of
charge in the combustion chamber and this dilution subsequently
reduces the NOx production [435,460,467]. Therefore, the combined
effect of water vaporization absorbing heat, relatively high molar heat
capacity of water, and increased partial pressure of oxygen pull down
the peak combustion temperature and thus, decrease the NOx forma-
tion [467,475,476]. Sabramanian et alD
X. [458] in the year of 2011 inves-
tigated the impact of adding water into a diesel engine by using two
different methods of WDE and WF and reported that albeit both
methods resulted in similar NO emission reductions at high loads but
the WDE method led to more promising results at lower loads. This
could be explained by the findings of Shah et alD
X. (2009) and Tauzia et
alD
X. (2010) who argued that the WF could lead to an increased heat loss
at the cylinder wall and consequently negatively affect the engine
overall efficiency [436,468].

PIn a different study, Parlak, et alD

X. (2012) also investigated the WF
method and concluded that NOx emissions was reduce by 33% by
fumigation of 20% water into the intake manifold of a diesel engine
fueled with B20 [442]. The reduction of NOx emissions in response
to the fumigation of water into the engine manifold has been found
proportional to the water fumigatation rate [436,468]. This increas-
ing effect is ascribed to the temperature reduction which in turn has
several consequences: water cooling effect due to vaporization,
increasing of heat capacity due to higher trapped mass, increasing of
specific heat capacity due to air dilution with water vapor, increasing
in ignition delay and eventually decrease of chemical reactions rates
[436,468].

PTesfa et alD

X. (2012) compared water injection into the intake mani-
fold at different rates of 1.8 kg/h and 3 kg/h using neat biodiesel and
observed NOx exhaust emission reduction by approximately 30%
and 50%, respectively. They also reported that less reduction rates
were obtained by increasing the engine speeds [432]. This could be
explained by the fact that at the beginning of fuel injection, i.e.,
lower speeds, air temperature is lower than that of the diesel fuel as
water injected during the intake stroke vaporizes and cools the air.
This leads to an increase in the ignition delay [458]. Long ignition
delays promote the premixed stage of combustion process, which
decreases the diffusive burning and hence, contributes to the reduc-
tion in NOx emission [9]. While at higher engine speeds, the volu-
metric efficiency and gas flow motion within the combustion
cylinders increase and these in turn lead to a faster mixing between
air and fuel resulting in the minimization of the ignition delay
[432,477].

PSarvi et alD

X. [456] in the year 2009 used a specific setup engine test
bed and performed a DWI into the cylinder chamber. Their results
X35%) in NOx emissions using this
revealed a significant reduction (¡D
method and were in line with those of Bedford et alD
X. [434]. It could be
concluded that main phenomenon behind the NOx emission reduction
achieved in these studies was the lower peak temperature and the
inert water mass in the combustion region, which consequently
reduced the NOx formation rate [456]. It is worth mentioning that in
a number of investigations the impact of water on NOx emissions has
also been attributed to the increased concentration of OH radicals
[453,459,478]. Miyauchi et alD
X. [479] argued that OH radicals promote
the oxidation of hydrocarbon fragments leading to reduced NOx levels
X. who
[453]. Similar findings were also reported by Herbinet et alD
investigated on the chemical kinetic oxidation mechanism [480].

PThe trade-off relationship between NOx and PM emissions is con-
sidered as a major obstacle when reducing pollutant emissions is
aimed as it is difficult to reduce both by using traditional approaches
[106]. The combination of oxygen-enriched combustion and the
WDE was proposed by Liang et alD
X(2013) as a promising method to
control PM and NOx simultaneously, while maintain a comparable
bsfc [453]. They concluded that the best engine performance was
X20% and low level of
obtained when water content in fuel was >D
oxygen enrichment was employed [453]. It has also been stated in
some studies that at higher loads, the WF was capable of reducing
NOx emissions without resulting in a large increase in PM emissions
as the air flow rate remained approximately unchanged [436,468].

PHC emission
PMost of the published reports have stressed on the negative
impacts of water addition on HC emission [408,461]. For instance,
Yang et alD
X. [10] reported a slight increase in HC emissions using
water-emulsion fuels containing organic additives such as glycerin
when the engine was operated at low loads conditions, however, no
significant differences in HC emission were observed at high loads.
Lif et alD
X. [461] argued that the increase in HC emissions as a result of
water addition is in fact attributed to the slightly longer ignition
delays caused by the presence of water. In a different study, Debnath
X. reported that blending 5% water into biodiesel led to 22%
et alD
higher HC emission compared with neat biodiesel [454,460].

PIn an investigation, a water-ethanol-biodiesel emulsion was
investigated by Kumar and Jaikumar (2014) [233]. They argued that
the investigated emulsion led to higher HC emissions at low power
outputs, while opposite results were obtained at high power outputs
[233]. Their findings could be justified by improved vaporization and
atomization of the water-ethanol-biodiesel emulsions as a result of
micro explosion which led to better mixing with air and conse-
quently complete combustion of the fuel at high loads [233]. Similar
results were also reported by Samec et alD
X.
X. (2002) and Jazair et alD
(2011). Overall, the positive effects of water on HC emissions at high
power inputs were reportedly deteriorated with increasing water
percentage in water-diesel emulsions [463,470]. On the other hand,
the HC emissions tended to increase at low power outputs because
of the quench layer of unburned ethanol present in the combustion
chamber [233]. Moreover,
the increased HC emission results
obtained by the mentioned studies could also be explained by both
the higher latent heat value and lower cetane number of the fuels as
a result of water addition to diesel or oxygenated additive-diesel
emulations. These factors would in fact result in a slower evapora-
tion, leading to a higher fraction of HC surviving the combustion pro-
cess appearing in the engine exhaust gases [106,436,468].

PYang et alD

Xin the year 2013 compared an emulsion fuel with 82.4%
diesel, 5% water and 12.6% (v/v) nano-organic additives (as surfac-
tant) on a 4-cylinder, common rail diesel engine. They reported that
HC emissions were very low and that no obvious differences were
observed between the tested fuels at all engine speeds as a result of
water addition [435]. They linked the results obtained to the high
air-to-fuel equivalence ratio of the tested fuels and that a sufficient

Pamount of oxygen was available for the fuel to be burnt completely
[435]. Decreases in HC emissions by using water emulsions were
also reported by some other researchers. Among those, Ghojel et alD
X.
reported that HC emissions were decreased by 60-90% when com-
busting a 13% water-diesel emulsion [447]. The micro-explosion
phenomenon in the emulsified fuel caused by the volatility differen-
ces between water and Diesel fuel was highlighted as the reason
behind their findings [447]. In better words, the violent disintegra-
tion as a result of the micro-explosion phenomenon dispersed the
fine droplets and consequently enhanced the fuel-air mixing in the
combustion chamber leading to reduced formation of soot and HC
[465].

PWater addition strategy has also been found effective on HC
emissions. In a study, K€okk€ul€unk et alD
X. (2013) reported that the HC
emissions increased by injecting 20% water steam until the engine
speed of 2000 rpm [467]. They linked this increase to the limits of
uncertainty considering the measurement accuracy [467]. A differ-
ent study simultaneously investigating different strategies for add-
ing water showed that HC emission levels were low in the injection
strategy compared to the emulsion strategy at low loads but their
results were similar for both strategies at high loads [458]. It is
worth quoting that both strategies led to higher HC emissions than
neat diesel probably due to incomplete combustion caused by lower
equivalence ratio [458]. Nazha et alD
X. (2001) reported that by increas-
ing water quantity using the water fumigation into the inlet mani-
fold, a significant increase in HC emissions was recorded [481]. In a
different study in which the DWI was used, Sarvi et alD
X. (2009)
revealed that HC emissions were decreased significantly by adding
higher amounts of water to diesel, Indeed, at lower loads the stable
results did not observed [456].

PPM emission
PThe mechanism of the effect of water addition on smoke forma-
tion is rather difficult to interpret but the published reports unani-
mously claim that PM emission is decreased by using water in diesel
or biodiesel-diesel blends. In a study conducted by Farfaletti et alD
X.
(2005) significant drops in PM emissions were obtained (¡D
X59% and
X32%) by using a 6% and a 13% water-diesel emission fuel, respec-
¡D
X. [279] also showed that a 15% water-diesel
tively [464]. Nadeem et alD

Pemulsion led to >D
X70% reduction in PM emission. Moreover, they
also reported that the type of emulsifier could clearly influence the
magnitude of the reduction. The use of 20% water-diesel emulsions
also reportedly resulted in reduced PM emission compared to neat
diesel [459,463]. Maiboom and Tauzia (2011) stressed that the
reduction rate they achieved using the high water inclusion rate of
20% was especially significant at low load conditions (the maximum
observed PM relative reduction of 94%) and when injection pressure
X.
was increased [459]. Their results were in line with those of Lif et alD
who reported that at low loads, the PM reduction of a water-FT die-
sel emulsion stood at 42% while at moderate loads, the reduction
rate achieved was less standing at 29% only [461]. In fact, Maiboom
and Tauzia (2011) stated that PM emission occasionally increased
when water-diesel emulsion was used at higher loads [459]. Con-
trary to the findings of the above-mentioned studies, Ithnin et alD
X.
claimed that the maximum PM reduction of 45% by using a 20%
water-diesel emulsion was recorded at high loads in comparison
with neat diesel [449].

PIn case of neat biodiesel, it has been reported that the PM emis-
sion level increased by increasing water content in the water-biodie-
sel emulsion [460]. This could be attributed to the reduced rate of
soot afterburning during the combustion process caused by a signifi-
cant reduction of the combustion temperature [460].

POverall, the different parameters that could influence on the PM
production could be listed as follows: (1) the vaporization of water
and the dilution effect of water leading to a lower combustion tem-
perature within the core spray where soot is produced, resulting in
reduced soot production rates [432,433]. (2) Secondary atomization
due to micro-explosion of water-diesel emulsion droplets leading to
a better dispersion and improved air-fuel mixture formation [439].
(3) The presence of water may also lead to enhanced soot oxidation
by increased concentration of oxidization species such as OH
[433,458,465]. (4) Prolonged premixed combustion phase due to
long ignition delay when using WDE. It is worth mentioning that the
combustion process in diesel engines includes two phases: premixed
combustion and diffusion combustion.

Pmanifold, a significant reduction of soot by up to 75% was achieved
while when water was eliminated, the reduction rate achieved
climbed down to 50% only [453]. They argued that beside the above-
mentioned reasons, the higher oxygen/fuel ratio of the WDE than
that of neat diesel fuel was also a determining factor which led to
lower PM emission. The PM-reducing impacts of water addition
using the DWI strategy D
Xhave also been reported in the literature. For
X. (2000), direct injec-
instance, in a study conducted by Bedford et alD
tion of 23% water into the cylinder led to an approximately 75% PM
emission reduction [434].

PWater-diesel emulsion when used in combination with EGR
reportedly resulted in simultaneous reduction of both NOx and
PM emissions with the relative reduction being approximately
the same for different EGR rates [459]. Accordingly, the tradi-
tional NOx-PM trade-off could be largely improved by using this
strategy [459].

2.4. Antioxidants

PAntioxidants also known as free-radical quenching agents are
characterized by their capabilities in inhibiting the oxidation of
other molecules [482]. Oxidation reactions lead to the production
of free radicals and the subsequent chain reactions caused by
these radicals. A free radical is defined as the unpaired electron
of a molecule which determines the oxidation reaction rate.
Antioxidants through self-oxidation terminate these chain reac-
tions by removing free radical intermediates and inhibit other
oxidation reactions resulting in prolonged shelf-life of the sub-
stances. These additives are classified as either radical trapping
(chain breaking) or peroxide decomposing; terms that describe
the mechanisms by which they function [483]. The radical-trap-
ping antioxidants, such as hindered phenols and secondary aro-
matic amines, react with oxygen radicals (peroxy and alkoxy),
while phosphites and phosphates function as peroxide decom-
posing by abstracting peroxidic oxygen from hydroperoxides and
peroxides and reducing them [484].

PIt is well-documented that maintaining biodiesel quality dur-
ing long-term storage is difficult because of the fuel autoxida-
tion phenomenon [485(cid:1)491]. Generally,
the mixture of
antioxidant and biodiesel fuel suppresses the peroxyl free radi-
cal formations by reaction with aromatic amines. In fact, these
peroxyl free radical formations have been reported as one of
the main causes of
the higher biodiesel NOx emissions
[483,492,493]. Among free radical formations during combus-
tion, hydroperoxyl ((cid:4)OOH), hydroxyl (HO(cid:4)), alkoxyl (RO(cid:4)) and
peroxyl (ROO(cid:4)) radicals have major impacts on NOx formation
[483,493]. From the mechanism point of view, these radicals
react with N2 and N2O and form nitrogen oxides. Antioxidants
can reduce free radical formations through four routes; chelat-
ing the transition metal catalysts, chain breaking reactions,
reducing the concentration of reactive radicals, and scavenging
the initiating radicals [494,495].

PVarious antioxidants have been reportedly used in diesel-biodie-
sel blends including N,N'-diphenyl-1, 4-phenylenediamine (DPPDA),
N-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (NPPDA)
[496], p-phenylenedi-
amine (PPDA), a-Tocopherol acetate [497], L-ascorbic acid (LAA)
[498], ethylenediamine (EPA) [463,496], 4-methyl-6-tert-butyphe-
nol (MTBP) [499], tert-butyl hydroxylquinone (TBHQ) [497], butyla-
tedhydroxy
(BHA),
acidpropylgallate (PG) [500], 1, 2, 3 tri-hydroxy benzene (Pyrogallol,
(PY)) [501], propyl gallate (PrG) [502], and 2-ethylhexyl nitrate
(EHN) (which has used as cetane number enhancer) [69,202,430]. It
is worth quoting that these antioxidants increase the stability of bio-
diesel without causing any significant negative effects on its physi-
cochemical properties [503]. Antioxidants themselves have different
stability indexes and based on the findings of the available reports in

butylatedhydroxyanisol

toluene

(BHT),

Pthe literature TBHQ is considered as the most stable antioxidant in
comparison with BHA, BHT, EHN. But EHN has been reported as a
better candidate for decreasing NOx emission at the expense of
increasing CO and HC emissions [504]. In fact, the most important
effect of antioxidant addition into biodiesel-diesel blends is reducing
NOx pollutant, which could also be accompanied by an increase in
CO and HC emissions [496,497].

P2.4.1. The effect of antioxidant additives on engine performance

Pbsfc
PAntioxidants are mostly studied because of their effects on the
physicochemical properties of fuels and their impacts on fuel con-
sumption have been given a lower degree of importance. Neverthe-
less, different types of antioxidants have been reported to exert
different effects on fuel consumption. However, these variations are
not significant possibly due to low antioxidants inclusion rates in
X. [503,505] added
biodiesel-diesel blends. For instance, Fattah et alD
BHA and BHT as antioxidant into B20 at a concentration of
2000 ppm and reported that the addition of both antioxidants to B20
resulted in a slight reduction in bsfc. Such a trend was also reported
in the combustion of neat biodiesel containing different amounts of
NPPD [506], DPPD [506], EHN [506], PY [501,507], MTBP[499], BHA,
BHT [508], LAA, BHT and a(cid:1)tocopherol [496] as well as BHT, BHA,
TBHQ and PrG [502] antioxidants. However, these differences
between the antioxidant-caontaining biodiesel and neat biodiesel
were not meaningful. Insignificant decreases in bsfc upon the addi-
tion of EDA and PPDA into B100 were also reported by Varatharajan
et alD
X. [496]. They attributed their findings to the friction reduction
properties of the amine groups contained in the antioxidants used.

PThe above-mentioned insignificant changes observed in bsfc in
response to antioxidants addition could not be generalized to all
studies. For instance, Ileri and Kocar [497] investigated the effect of
antioxidant concentration on the bsfc of B20 containing 500, 750,
and 1000 ppm of BHA, BHT, TBHQ and EHN antioxidants and claimed
that the TBHQ and ETN decreased bsfc values by 10.2% and 4.2%,
respectively, but offered no explanations. In a different study, Palash
X. (2014) also reported higher heating values of different biodie-
et alD
sel-diesel blends (i.e., B10, and B20) caused by the addition of the
DPPD antioxidant resulting in decreased fuel consumption (by
approximately 2%) [483].

Pbte
PBiodiesel is generally characterized by a slightly lower bte value
than diesel fuel. The findings of Fattah et alD
X. revealed that the com-
bustion of BHA-B20 and BHT-B20 led to higher bte than B20, the dif-
ferences were statistically insignificant though [503,505]. Similar
results were also reported in response to the addition of PY
(1000 ppm) into neat biodiesel [501,507] and NPPD [506], DPPD
[506], EHN [506], into the B20. These marginal increases in the bte
value could be explained by the slightly higher power output
together with lower bsfc achieved when using the antioxidant-
treated samples [503,505]. In another study, Varatharajan and Cher-
alathan reported that adding 1000 ppm of DPPD into the B20 did not
result in sensible changes in bte at most of the loads investigated,
while at full load they observed 0.80% loss in bte [493]. They argued
that the addition of antioxidants slightly reduced the cylinder pres-
sure which in turn could have negatively influenced on the thermal
efficiency [493]. Bte reduction by adding LAA into the B100 was
reported recently in a study conducted by Balaji and Cheralathan
(2016), however, the reductions obtained were not significant [509].

P2.4.2. The effect of antioxidant additives on engine emissions

PCO emission
PIt has been reported that the addition of antioxidant additives
into biodiesel-diesel blends increased the CO emissions significantly
as a result of reduced oxidation capability of CO in the presence of
easily
the

antioxidants

(Table 14)

could be

[483].

X35.8%, and ¡D

Pcomprehended by taking into account the findings of Fattah et alD
X.
(2014a) who reported that lower CO emission reduction rates were
achieved when the antioxidant BHA and BHT were included in B20
[498]. More specifically, B20 led to ¡D
X40.7% reduction in CO emission
compared with neat diesel while B20CBHA and B20CBHT resulted
in deteriorated rates of ¡D
X37.7%, respectively [498,505].
The same group of researchers in different studies investigated the
combustion of B20 produced from different oil feedstocks in combi-
nation with BHA, BHT, and TBHQ antioxidants and achieved similar
results [503,505]. These findings were in line with those of the other
studies in which DPPD [493,506,510], NPPD [506], EHN [506], TBHQ
[498,502], EHN [504], MTBP [499], LAA [509] and PY [507] were
included into biodiesel-diesel blends. As mentioned earlier, the hin-
drance caused by the antioxidants during the conversion of CO to
CO2 has been highlighted as the leading cause of the increases
observed in CO emission [497, 503, 505].
PIn a study conducted by Palash et alD

X. the addition of 0.15% DPPD
antioxidant into B5, B10, B15, and B20 led to fluctuating variations
in the emitted CO, i.e., C7%, -48%, C5% and ¡D
X13%, respectively, com-
pared to neat diesel [483]. However, despite the significant CO
X48% in this study caused by the addition of DPPD into
reduction of ¡D
X. did not try to present any reasons nor any justifica-
B10, Palash et alD
tions for the fluctuations observed [483].

PContrary to the above-mentioned reports, Ryu (2010) claimed
that the addition of TBHQ, PrG, BHA, and BHT antioxidants into B100
led to no sensible effects on the CO emission [502]. In a different
study, Gan and Ng (2010) reported that BHA blended into B10 and
B20 decreased the CO levels, while both BHT and TBHQ increased CO
formation at all test points [510]. However, the authors refrained
from presenting any reasons to their findings. Kivevele et alD
X. studied
the effect of PY inclusion (1000 ppm) into B100 and reported that
the blend used reduced the emitted CO [501]. Their results are how-
ever questionable as they reported slightly higher CO emission for
B100 than neat diesel which opposes the outcomes of the other
studies on the fact that biodiesel inclusion in diesel results in
decreased CO emissions (EPA, 2002; D

X. 6) [501].

X. [498, 503, 505] investigated the addition of BHA,
BHT, and TBHQ into B20 and reported that BHA-B20 followed by
BHT-B20 led to the lowest NOx emissions compared with neat diesel
X3.9%, respectively) [503, 505]. They stressed that BHA
(¡D
was more effective than BHT and TBHQ on NOx reduction [498].
Such comparison among antioxidants were also performed by Ileri
and Ko ̧car who emphasized that EHN and BHT when included B20 in
were more effective than BHA and TBHQ in lowering the formation
of NOx [497]. However, these authors did not observe a clear NOx
formation trend corresponding to the increasing concentrations of
the additives [497]. To the contrary, Gan and NG [510] using similar
antioxidants, claimed that the NOx levels in the flue gas was propor-
tional to the antioxidants concentrations in the fuel blends. In
another study by Ileri and Ko ̧car (2014), they reported that the best
NOx reduction results belonged to EHN and BHA [504].

PVaratharajan et alD

X. reported high NOx reduction through addition
of different type of antioxidants (EDA, PPDA, BHT, a tocopherol, and
L-ascorbic acid) into B100 compared with neat biodiesel [496]. They
X35 and
also claimed that the best results, i.e., reduction rates of ¡D
¡D
X22% were achieved using EDA and PPDA, respectively [496]. Such
NOx emission-decreasing effect was also reported in the combustion
of NPPD [506], EHN [506], DPPDCB20 [483,493,506], MTBP [499],
X. highlighted that the
LAA [509] and PYCB20 [507]. Varatharajan et alD
kinetics involved in the NOx reduction mechanism by PPDA is highly
complex and that there is limited understanding of the chemistry
involved in these processes [496]. On the other hand, Ileri and Ko ̧car
suggested that NOx reduction by EHN was due to the increased CN of
the final B20 fuel blend as a result of EHN addition [497]. This further
elaborated that by increasing the CN of the fuel, the ignition process

Pin the combustion chamber was accelerated which in turn resulted
in decreased NOx formations [497]. It is worth quoting that, phenolic
hydroxyl groups available in the structure of antioxidants have also
been suggested as one of the key reasons interfering with the mech-
anism behind prompt NO [489,504,505].

PUnusual results on increasing NOx emission in response to anti-
oxidants inclusion could also be found in the literature. For instance,
Ryu in the year of 2009 and 2010 reported that the addition of
TBHQ, PrG, BHA, and BHT antioxidants into biodiesel slightly
increased NOx but this increase was not significant [500,502].

PHC emission
PAddition of BHA and BHT reportedly reduced the emission-reduc-
tion benefits of B20 fuel. However, the level of HC emission was still
much lower than that of fossil diesel [503,505]. Varatharajan et alD
X.
reported a clear increase in HC emissions at all the loads investigated
by the addition of BHA, BHT and TBHQ antioxidants into biodiesel
X. reported that the addi-
[496]. In another investigation, Fattah et alD
tion of BHA, BHT, and TBHQ into B20 led to 9, 14 and 21% increase in
HC emission, respectively, compared with neat B20, but these
amounts were yet lower than diesel fuel [498]. Similar results were
also reported for the combustion of PPDA [483], NPPD [506], EHN
[506], PY [507], BHA [508], BHT [508] and DPPD [493,506] blended
into biodiesel-diesel fuel blends. These deteriorations in HC emis-
sions have been attributed to the reduction of free radical formation
by antioxidants, which could significantly reduce the oxidation of
HC [493,496,505].

PContrary to the findings of the above mentioned studies,

_
Ileri and
Ko ̧car (2014) claimed that the combustion of 1000 ppm BHA and
BHT blended into B20 led to 39% and 4.3% increase in HC emissions
while the addition of 1000 ppm of TBHQ and EHN into B20 resulted
in opposite outcomes (¡D
X12.7% reduction in HC emis-
sions, respectively) [504]. Unfortunately, they failed to provide any
reasons for the changes observed. In a different investigations, Kive-
vele et alD
X. (2011) [501] and Ryu (2010) [500] reported that the addi-
tion of different amounts of PY, TBHQ, and PrG antioxidants into
biodiesel had no significant effects on the unburned HC exhaust
emissions.

2.5. Polymeric-based additives

PThe global consumption of polymers has experienced a sharply-
increasing trend as a result of growing industrialization and urbani-
zation. Consequently, various recycling methods have been intro-
duced to address the concerns associated with polymer wastes.
Recently, dissolution of polymers in biodiesel was investigated a
number of research groups [512]. Polymers dissolution is an impor-
tant phenomenon in polymer science and engineering and is known
for its important applications in variety of areas such as: microli-
thography, membrane science, and packaging [512]. As mentioned
earlier, the concept of polymer dissolution was also put into test for
recycling purposes. In fact, the possibility of dissolving waste plastics
in biodiesel and using the polymer solutions as fuels in engines has
opened up exciting possibilities for disposal of plastic waste that
would otherwise end up in landfills or get incinerated, both of which
are energy-intensive and not environmentally friendly. The waste
plastics whose dissolution in biodiesel has been investigated include
low-density polyethylene (LDPE) [512], polystyrene (PS) [513],
expanded polystyrene (EPS) [514].

PThe dissolution of polymer wastes into a solvent involves two
transport processes, namely solvent diffusion and chain disentangle-
ment. In addition, there are some important parameters involved in
the dissolution of polymer wastes in biodiesel, such as polymer
molecular weight, solvent diffusion coefficient, gel layer thickness,
rate of agitation, and dissolution temperature [515]. The molecular
weight, the dissolution temperature, and diffusion boundary layer
thickness have more important roles in the dissolution of waste

Pplastics in biodiesel compared with the other mentioned parameters
[512,515].
In a research work, Narasimhan [516] showed that
increasing the polymer molecular weight shifted the process from
dissolution to controlled-disentanglement, but, decreasing the diffu-
sion boundary layer thickness led to the opposite. The application of
polymer wastes (waste plastics) in biodiesel has been revealed to
exert positive effects on engine performance and emission parame-
ters [517].

P2.5.1. The effect of polymeric-based additives on engine performance

Pbsfc
PKuzhiyil and Kong [513] in the year 2009 investigated the bsfc of
PS-biodiesel blend in a turbocharged and 4 John Deere cylinder die-
sel engine. They reported that in comparison with B100, the bsfc
decreased by using the PS concentrations of 2 and 5%, but the bsfc
increased using the 10 and 15% PS concentrations. They pinpointed
the advancement in the fuel injection timing as a result of PS addi-
tion as the main reason for the observed decrease in bsfc [513]. The
best bsfc was achieved when the biodiesel sample containing 5% PS
was used [513]. Similar result was also obtained in a different study
conducted by Mohammadi et alD
X. [53] who investigated the dissolu-
tion of EPS in B5. They combusted the resultant fuel blend on a 4
liter, 4 cylinder diesel engine (MT 4.244 model) and claimed that the
EPS-B5 led to a significant decrease in bsfc (8.5%). They tested differ-
ent EPS levels (i.e., 25, 50 and 75 g in a liter of biodiesel) and found
that the B5 blend containing 50 g EPS/L biodiesel was highly advan-
tageous in terms of both engine performance and emissions parame-
ters [53]. In a different study, Mohammi et alD
X. stabilized an EPS-
biodiesel solution using acetone and stated that some of the physical
properties of the fuel blend D
Xwere influenced by the dissolution of
polymer wastes and the stabilizer. More specifically, the flash point
temperature of the conventional B5 fuel was reportedly increased,
while density and viscosity values were reduced [517]. The attrib-
uted the lower bsfc of the EPS-B5 blend to the reduced viscosity of
the fuel blend [517].

PIn a study, Devaraj et alD

X. [518] investigated the addition of 5 and
10% DEE into waste plastic pyrolysis oil (WPPO). They reported that
neat diesel fuel and WPPO had original bsfc values of 0.560 and
0.616 at 20% load and 0.276 and 0.292 at full load, respectively.
While by adding 5 and 10% DEE into WPPO, the bsfc values were
changed to 0.605 and 0.591 at 20% and 0.294 and 0.301 at full load,
respectively. They justified that the decrease in bsfc observed by
suing 10% DEE at 20% load by faster burning of the fuel blend result-
ing in a more efficient combustion process [518]. In contract to these
reports, Ananthakumar et alD
X. (2016) and Kaimal and Vijayabalan
(2016) who separately investigated on the addition of different lev-
els of waste plastic (WP) oil into diesel fuel reported the WP oil

Pcaused increased bsfc values due to deteriorated atomization and
vaporization of the fuel blend as a result of its high viscosity
[519,520].
Pbte
PMohammadi et alD

X. reported that the inclusion of EPS at various
concentrations led to increased BTE while the best result was
obtained when the maximum EPS concentration of 75 g EPS/L bio-
diesel was used at maximum load and torque. Overall, a mean
increase of 9.8% in the bte value of the EPS-B5 was achieved in their
investigation [53]. These improvements could be attributed to the
fact that EPS dissolution in biodiesel could enhance some physical
characteristics of biodiesel such as dynamic viscosity and subse-
quently, thermal efficiency [517].

PDevaraj et alD

X. reported that the addition of 5 and 10% DEE into
WPPO increased the bte at high loads from 27.75% to 27.51% and
29.12%, respectively. The presence of oxygen in the DEE and the con-
sequent more complete combustion of the fuel was highlighted in
their report as main factor which enhance the bte value. It is worth
quoting that they observed no significant differences in bte at lower
loads using all the investigated combinations of WPPO and DEE
[518].

P2.5.2. The effect of polymeric-based additives on engine emissions

PCO emission
PKuzhiyil and Kong (2009) claimed that the dissolution of PS in
B100 at low PS concentrations slightly increased the CO emissions
but significantly higher increases were observed when the PS con-
centration was increased to 10 and 15% [513]. This could be ascribed
to the high viscosity of the PS-fuel blend resulting in poor spray
atomization and consequently deteriorated combustion [513]. In
addition, their results showed that the presence of EGR further dete-
riorated the combustion of the 10% PS blended into biodiesel leading
to significantly higher CO emissions. Moreover, advanced injection
timing was also found to increase the emitted CO pollutant [513].
Very recently, Kaimal and Vijayabalan (2016) as well as Ananthaku-
X. (2016) argued that the addition of WP oil into neat diesel
mar et alD
led to increases in CO emission due to higher combustion tempera-
ture in the cylinder [519,520]. In a different study, Mohammadi et alD
X.
[53] claimed that the exhausted CO from the diesel engine fueled
with EPS was lower than that of the EPS-free fuel. They stated that
25 gr EPS/L biodiesel had no meaningful effects on the CO emission,
but 50 and 75 g of EPS caused approximately 50% reduction in the
emitted CO at the speed of 2000 rpm and 37 and 28% at the speed of
1400 rpm, respectively [53].

PDevaraj et alD

X. claimed that by increasing the concentration of DEE
into WPPO from 5 to 10%, CO emission decreased at full loads [518].

PThey attributed their finding to the improvement in spray atomiza-
tion [518].

PNOx emission
PIt has been reported that NOx emission was significantly
increased by adding PS into neat biodiesel. For instance, Kuzhiyil
and Kong (2009) stated that 10% PS increased the NOx emissions
when included B100 [513]. They also highlighted that when fuel
injection was advanced, NOx emissions further increased [513]. The
application of EGR system would strongly be recommended to
reduce NOx pollutant when beneficial additives with a negative
impact on NOx emissions are used [513]. In different investigations,
NOx emission increases in reponse to the addition of WP oil into
neat diesel was reported. They linked this increase to the high rate
of heat release [519,520].
PMohammadi et alD

X. reported that EPS/B5 led to lower NOx
emissions than B5 elaborating that 75 g EPS/L biodiesel at the
highest engine speed decreased the NOx emission by 12.45% at
full load [53].

PIn the study of Devaraj et alD

X. (2015) who investigated the effects
of addition DEE (5 and 10%) into WPPO, the NOx emissions of the
blends were reduced by increasing the blending percentage of DEE
[518]. They highlighted that this result was due to the fact that DEE
is a cetane improver and any increases in cetane number would ulti-
mately result in decreased NOx emission. Moreover, DEE has a high
oxygen content and a high heat of vaporization which cumulatively
facilitate fuel ignition which subsequently yields shorter combustion
duration [518].
PHC emission
PHC emissionD

X was increased significantly by increasing the PS
concentration particularly to 10 and 15%, compared with B100
(Table 15) [513]. The high viscosity of the PS-fuel blend resulting
in poor spray atomization (due to heavy polymer molecules)
could be regarded as the main reason behind such findings
[513]. The retardment in the injection timing when combusting
PS-B100 blends reportedly reduced HC emissions due to the
higher combustion temperature (as a result of intensified pre-
mixed combustion) [513].

PAddition of 5 and 10% DEE into WPPO increased HC emission
[518]. This increase could be ascribed to the leakage of the fuel
through the injector nozzle due to the considerably lower viscosity
of the fuel blend caused by DEE inclusion [518]. The inclusion of dif-
ferent amounts of WP oil into neat diesel also reportedly led to
incresed HC emissions [519,520].

3. Concluding remarks and future prospects

PThis review has attempted to scrutinize and discuss the
effects of different biodiesel/diesel additives on the performance
and emission parameters of diesel engines along with their pros
and cons (Fig. 11).

PAlthough biodiesel/diesel additives could improve engine com-
bustion, they should not be regarded as a “silver bullet” for all cases
and situations. Overall, the following conclusions could be drawn
from the published literature:

P1. Most of research works have been devoted to oxygenated addi-
tives compared with the other biodiesel/diesel additives
because of their low cost and the availability of synthesis
equipment.

P2. The impacts of oxygenated additives on bsfc and bte have been
reported to be negative in almost all the published research
works owing to an increase in the ignition delay and a decrease
in the calorific value of the final fuel blends.

P3. Engine performance parameters have been dramatically deteri-
orated in the presence of oxygenated additives at lower loads

Pdue to the high cooling effect of these additives on the cylinder
temperature.

P4. Incorporation of methanol, ethanol, and especially DEE into
diesel fuel at inclusion volumes lower than 10% has reportedly
led to improved bsfc and bte values.

P5. Addition of alcohols into diesel fuel has resulted in an increase
in NOx and CO emissions and a decrease in HC and PM emis-
sions owing to the presence of higher levels of oxygen in the
combustion region.

P6. Using ethers as biodiesel/diesel additive could mitigate CO, PM,
and NOx emissions. The molecular structure of ethers as well as
the other positive attributes of oxygenated additives including
ethers could be the reason to these improvements.

P7. Advancing injection timing when oxygenated additive-diesel
fuel blends are used could improve the engine performance
parameters, particularly in the multi injection systems by com-
pensating the ignition delay caused by the combustion of the
oxygenated additives.

P8. CO emission has been remarkably decreased when oxygenated
additives are used at higher loads due to an increase in the
temperature of the combustion chamber.

P9. Addition of oxygenated additives by fumigation has reportedly
lowered the engine performance parameters because of the
cooling effect of the oxygenated additives on the cylinder tem-
perature.

P10. Fumigation of oxygenated additives has been found to decrease
engine emissions (except for NOx) due to lowering cylinder
temperature.

P11. Metallic-based additives have been shown to result in the best
impacts on both performance parameters and emission mitiga-
tion among the applied biodiesel/diesel additives. Several rea-
sons could be presented for these improvements: accelerating
combustion rates, reducing ignition delay, boosting calorific
values, and increasing oxidation rates; all could be leading to a
more complete combustion.

P12. Like metallic-based additives, CNTs additive have also been
found promising in terms of their effects on engine perfor-
mance and emission parameters. Their positive attributes
have been associated with reducing ignition delay and the
highly reactive surfaces of CNTs leading to a cleaner com-
bustion.

P13. Using water in the form of emulsion has been found to be a
more promising strategy for improving engine performance
compared with the other methods. The positive effect of
micro-explosion phenomenon has been offered as the leading
cause of the differences observed.

P14. Unlike biodiesel-diesel blends, the addition of water into neat
diesel fuel in both forms of emulsion and fumigation has
increased CO emission. The high latent heat of vaporization of
water could be responsible for such increase.

P15. It has been unanimously reported by several researchers that
PM and NOx emissions could be tangibly decreased by adding
water into neat diesel and biodiesel-diesel blends in both forms
of emulsion and fumigation due to the cooling impact of water
on the cylinder temperature.

P16. At high loads and by using the water fumigation method, water
into diesel and biodiesel-diesel fuels have been shown to
increase and decrease HC emission, respectively.

P17. Although antioxidants result in an increase in the CO emission
(due to their inherent characteristic of diminish oxidation capa-
bility), they do not have a significant influence on the other
engine emission parameters nor on engine performance param-
eters due to their low inclusion rates in biodiesel-diesel blends.
P18. Using waste polymers has been proposed as a promising
approach for improving engine performance parameters and
reducing engine emissions running on biodiesel-diesel blends.

* The symbols C/¡ and #/" represent the trend and intensity of variations observed in each study, respectively, and cannot be used as a means of com-

parison among different studies. nc stands for no change.

** B, PS, and DEE stand for biodiesel, polystyrene, and diethylether respectively.

PFinally,

it is well-documented that biodiesel/diesel additives
could remarkably improve the combustion quality of diesel engines
from both performance and emissions viewpoints. However, future
research works should be conducted to address the following issues
pertaining to the real-world applications of biodiesel/diesel
additives:

P1. Further studies should be devoted to investigate the impacts of
combustion conditions of diesel engines on engine performance
and emission parameters when additives are used in fuel blends.
This is important since thermochemical characteristics of fuel
blends are changed by the inclusion of the additives into biodie-
sel-diesel blends.

P2. Durability tests are missing in the published literature available
on the application of diesel/diesel additives and should be taken
into consideration by future studies.

P3. The impact of diesel/diesel additives on engine corrosion should

also be investigated in order to ensure of their reliability.

P4. The biosafety issues of metallic- and non-metallic based addi-
tives should be examined due to the increasing levels of environ-
mental restrictions.

P5. Metallic- and nonmetallic-based additives should be further

studied to understand their exact action mechanisms.

P6. A large number of investigations should be performed on the use
of water as a biodiesel/diesel additive from the blend stability
viewpoint and its effects on engine corrosion.

P7. Comprehensive studies are still necessary to specify the best

strategy for adding water.

P8. Further works are required for decision making on the waste

polymers as biodiesel/diesel additive.
