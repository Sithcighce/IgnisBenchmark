The concept of direct CO 2 capture and conversion has attracted signiﬁcant interest from industries and 
academia in recent decades due to its potential to address the current grand challenge of global warm- 
ing/climate change, rapid depletion of fossil fuels and realization of a future carbon neutral ecosystem. 
The incumbent benchmark technology for CO 2 capture is the post-combustion ﬂue-gas “amine washing”, 
which is energy intensive and costly for large-scale commercial implementation. The CO 2  conversion 
technologies, on the other hand, are still at their infancy with many technical challenges to overcome, 
but primarily being explored in laboratory-scale, low-temperature, solution-based and high-temperature, 
solid-oxide-based electrochemical cells with renewable electricity perceived as the energy input. In this 
article, we provide a comprehensive overview on an emergent class of high-temperature electrochemi- 
cal CO 2 transport membranes that can capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals in single cat- 
alytic reactor fashion. The review starts with the chemistry and transport theory of three basic types 
of membranes purposely designed for different CO 2 feedstocks and downstream conversions. A range of 
key functional materials used in these membranes and their microstructural/electrochemical properties 
important to the CO 2 transport are then thoroughly discussed in conjunction with the effects of surface 
modiﬁcations and operating conditions. Several types of combined CO 2 capture and conversion catalytic 
reactors based on these membranes are also assessed with a focus on their working principles, system 
conﬁgurations and performance demonstrations. Finally, challenges and prospective of these electrochem- 
ical CO 2 transport membranes and their associated conversion reactors are candidly discussed for future 
development.

4.  CO 

1. Introduction 

The CO 

2 emission from burning of fossil fuels has signiﬁcantly 
increased the CO 
2  concentration in our atmosphere since the in- 
dustrial  revolution.  A  dire  consequence  of  the  increased  atmo- 
spheric  CO 
2  level  is  global  warming  and  climate  change,  which 
have  been  observed  to  increasingly  interrupt  our  daily  life  and 
economy  in  recent  decades  [1-4] .  So  far,  three  strategic  meth- 
ods have been proposed to curb CO 
2  concentration in the atmo- 
sphere: (1) increasing the use of environment-friendly energy re- 
sources  (e.g.,  solar,  wind,  nuclear,  etc.);  (2)  improving  the  eﬃ- 
ciency of current energy utilization (e.g., fuel cells and advanced 
turbines);  (3)  capturing  CO 
2  at  major  emitting  sources  [ 5 , 6 ].  In 
these strategies, method-1 is attractive and growing rapidly in re- 
cent  decades;  however,  the  slow  development  of  energy  storage 
technology is limiting the large-scale deployment [7-10] . Method- 
2 takes a longer time to mature due to the nature of new tech- 
nology development [11-15] . Even for the highly eﬃcient hydrogen 
fuel cells, for example, hydrogen is mainly produced from steam 
methane reforming (SMR), a process that also emits large quanti- 
2 capture (Method-3) from 
ties of CO 
the existing power plants, such as ﬂue gas, a major CO 
2  emitter, 
is currently regarded as the most practical solution to reduce the 
accumulation of the atmospheric CO 

2 [ 16 , 17 ]. Therefore, direct CO 

2 [ 4 , 18 ]. 

There are three major CO 

2 capture technologies that have been 
developed and demonstrated for the existing and future fossil fu- 

2 

eled power plants: pre-combustion capture, post-combustion cap- 
ture and oxy-fuel combustion capture [19-21] . The state-of-the-art 
CO 
2 capture technology at commercial scale is represented by the 
post-combustion  ﬂue  gas  “amine  washing” process  based  on  re- 
versible  chemical  absorption  principle  [ 2 , 22 , 23 ].  Physical  adsorp- 
tion based solid sorbents such as activated carbon [21] , molecu- 
lar sieves [24] , and metal-organic framework [ 25 , 26 ] are also be- 
ing developed to capture CO 
2 towards commercial demonstrations. 
2  capture  based  on  calcium  oxide  looping  is 
Thermochemical  CO 
also widely studied in recent years, which is suited to separate CO 
2 
from such as post-combustion capture process [27] . With the cap- 
2 , the concentrated solar energy was also suggested to use 
tured CO 
as an energy input to produce hydrocarbon fuels through H 
2 O/CO 
2 
splitting in isothermal membrane reactors [ 28 , 29 ]. 

One major hurdle for these technologies to become commer- 
2 capture, 
cial is the high energy consumption associated with CO 
which ultimately lowers the plant eﬃciency and increases the cost 
of  electricity  [ 30 , 31 ].  Membrane  technology  is  a  promising  gas 
separation process due to its continuous operation and ability to 
treat gases at high ﬂow rates. Compared to adsorption/absorption- 
based  technologies,  it  presents  the  following  advantages:  lower 
energy  consumption,  good  weight  and  space  adsorption,  no  re- 
generation  process,  simple  modular  system,  low  capital  and  op- 
eration costs and environment-friendliness. There are many kinds 
of  membranes  for  CO 
2  capture,  such  as  polymeric  membranes 
and porous inorganic membranes. Polymeric membranes operated

on  the  dissolution-diffusion  principle  are  currently  being  devel- 
oped at pilot scales [32-37] , among which polybenzimidazole (PBI) 
membranes show special advantages in mechanical strength, ther- 
mal and chemical stability. The supported ionic-liquid membranes 
have been considered for pre-combustion CO 
2 capture process, but 
environmental  concern  on  noxious  ionic  liquids  as  well  as  high 
cost  limit  its  scale-up  applications.  The  porous  inorganic  mem- 
branes, such as zeolite membranes and metal organic framework 
(MOF) membranes offer advantages of higher permeability. How- 
ever, the stability of membrane materials under realistic operation 
conditions is still poor, especially at high temperatures. However, 
all these membrane technologies requiring pressurized operation 
to enhance the permeability and suffering permeability-selectivity 
tradeoff,  are  susceptible  to  water  attack  and  incompatible  with 
high  temperatures.  Readers  can  ﬁnd  more  details  on  the  above 
membrane-based CO 
2  capture  technologies  in  other  reviews  [ 38 , 
39 ]. 

An alternative solution to overcome these barriers is to capture 
2  directly into valuable products 

and convert the captured hot CO 

( e.g. syngas, methanol, oleﬁns and aromatics etc.). Such a capture- 
and-conversion combined system promises lower cost and higher 
eﬃciency since the thermal energy in the hot ﬂue gas can be ef- 
ﬁciently  utilized,  and  separate  reactant-puriﬁcation  (for  O 
2 ,  CO 
2 
and H 
2 ), compression and transportation steps can be subsequently 
avoided. 

The high-temperature CO 

2 transport membranes (CO 

2 TMs) be- 
ing reviewed in this article are perfectly positioned to enable such 
2  capture-and-conversion  combined  systems 
high-temperature  CO 
[40-42] . An immediate example is high-temperature CO 
2 TM reac- 
tor coupled with dry methane reforming (DMR) to produce syngas; 
the reaction requires 60 0-80 0 °C to overcome the thermodynamic 
constraint [43-45] . As a typical chemical-potential-gradient driven 
membrane reactor, CO 
2 TMs-based conversion reactors are modu- 
lar, scalable, continuous, electricity-free, and more importantly, in- 
crementally adding or removing CO 
2 ) along the length 
of a tubular plug-ﬂow membrane, thus mitigating over-oxidation, 
shifting thermodynamic equilibrium and ultimately enhancing re- 
actants conversion and product selectivity. Compared to the low- 
2  conversion  counterpart  ( e.g.  electroreduction  of 
temperature  CO 
CO 
2 TMs reactors are expected to be 
more eﬃcient, selective, and easy to separate products due to fa- 
vored thermodynamics/kinetics and gas-solid reactions. Compared 
to the conventional high temperature CaO-based cyclic CO 
2  cap- 
ture [ 46 , 47 ], on the other hand, the CO 
2 TM approach is also ad- 
vantageous in process continuity, eﬃciency, and ability to achieve 
capture and conversion in single reactor.

Due to the relatively short history of the CO 

2 TM development, 
only  one  review  article  of  the  same  topic  published  by  Mutch 
et  al.  in  early  2019  was  noted  [48] ,  in  which  materials  selec- 
tion/properties and their interfacial compatibility on long-term sta- 
bility are the primary focus. The difference of the present review, 
however, rests at its deeper and broader account of fundamental 
mechanisms,  materials  advancements,  performance  limiting  fac- 
tors, novel membrane reactor designs and important advances that 
have  not  been  covered  by  Mutch  et  al.  [48] .  The  review  starts 
2 capture chemistry and transport theory of three 
with the basic CO 
types of CO 
2 TMs, followed by a detailed assessment of how con- 
stituent materials and their intrinsic properties, along with the sur- 
face modiﬁcations and operating conditions, affect CO 
2 ﬂux density 
and  stability  of  the  membranes.  Several  membrane  reactor  con- 
cepts are then introduced to show how the captured CO 
2 is used 
as a soft oxidizer to convert feedstocks (e.g., methane and ethane) 
into valuable products (e.g. syngas and ethylene) via the oxidative 
route in single reactor designs. Finally, future development, chal- 
2 TMs and the associated reactors are 
lenges and prospective of CO 
candidly discussed. Fig. 1 illustrates a summary of the main com- 
ponents covered by this review.

2 TM  reviewed  here  is  electrochemical  in  nature  and 
consisted  of  a  porous  solid  phase  scaffold  inﬁltrated  with  a 
molten  carbonate  (MC)  phase.  The  porous  solid  phase  acts  as 
an ionic and/or electronic conductor and placeholder for the MC 
phase,  while  the  MC  phase  acts  as  the  carbonate  ionic  con- 
ductor and gas sealant. Thus, the membrane is microstructurally 
2 TM 
dense. Based on the charge carriers of the solid material, CO 
can be grouped into three categories: (1) m ixed o xide-ionic and 
c arbonate-ionic c onductor (MOCC) membrane, (2) m ixed e lectronic 
and c arbonate-ionic c onductor (MECC) membrane, and (3) m ixed 
e lectronic,  o xide-ionic  and  c arbonate-ionic  c onductor  (MEOCC) 
membrane.

The  chemistry  that  enables  MOCC,  MECC  and  MEOCC  mem-

c, respectively. In common, the CO

branes is taken in the form of CO

compensated by a concomitant opposite ﬂow of O 2 − in the oxide- 
ionic  conductor  phase.  Therefore,  the  MOCC  membrane  is  more

the  feed  side.  If  O 2 − is  transported  from  the  sweep  side  to  the 
feed side, the ratio of CO

has been observed by Lan et al. [54] , Zhang et al. [55] and Ovalle- 
Encinia et al. [56] . If O 2 − is transported from the feed side to the

Several phenomenological models have been built so far to de-

of advanced membrane materials.

2.2.2. Surface-reaction and bulk-diffusion co-controlled transport 

2 TM will control the CO 

In some cases, such as the membrane thickness is thin, surface 
reactions on two sides of a CO 
2 transport 
process. New ﬂux equations are required to describe such a mixed 
surface-reaction and bulk-diffusion controlled permeation process. 
To the best of our knowledge, there are no related ﬂux equations 
reported for CO 
2 TMs. However, similar ﬂux equations have been 
developed  for  oxygen  transport  membranes  (OTMs)  [72-74] .  For 
example,  a  model  was  built  to  simulate  the  oxygen  permeation 
through a mixed conducting membrane by coupling the bulk dif- 
fusion of oxide-ionic and electronic transport with two surface re- 
actions [75-77] . Three assumptions are used to establish the ﬂux 
equation: (i) transport characteristics of the electrons and oxide- 
ions in a given region are constant regardless of the location and 
chemical potential of oxygen; (ii) gas-phase oxygen diffusion is fast 
enough to ignore the concentration gradient on the surface; (iii) all 
the steps of the permeation are under isothermal conditions, and 
the law of mass action is applicable to gas exchange reactions on 
the gas-solid interfaces. For CO 
2 TMs, similar assumptions can be 
adopted to build the ﬂux equation: (i) transport characteristics of 
carbonate ions, electrons and oxide-ions in a given region are con- 
stant regardless of the location and chemical potential of CO 
2 ; (ii) 
2  diffusion is fast enough to neglect the concentra- 
gas-phase CO 
tion gradient; (iii) all the steps of the CO 
2  permeation are under 
isothermal conditions, and the law of mass action is applicable to 
2  exchange reactions on the gas-solid-liquid interfaces. There- 
CO

tained by ﬁtting Eqs. (10 - 12 ), r’ and r" at a given temperature and 
CO 
2 partial pressure can be calculated by Eqs. (13) and (14) . Finally, 
n’ and n" values, exchange coeﬃcients and diffusion coeﬃcient can 
be calculated from the obtained experimental data. Therefore, it is 
possible to distinguish how much the CO 
2 transport is controlled 
by bulk diffusion and surface exchange reactions.

2.3. Terminology used for CO 2 transport in CO 2 TMs 

There  are  several  terminologies  in  the  literature  describing 
CO

Knowing the meaning of each term will be useful to correctly com- 
pare  the  performance  among  different  membranes.  Permeation 
ﬂux ( J 
i ) is a commonly used term to describe the volume of gas 
(i) permeating through the membrane per unit area and unit time. 
The  SI  unit  is  m 3  m −2  (cid:2)s −1 ,  although  others  such  as  mL  cm −2 
(cid:2)min −1  are often used as well. For gas-phase transport, the vol- 
ume is strongly dependent on pressure and temperature. As such, 
the permeation ﬂux is often given in terms of a "standard condi- 
tion or STP" deﬁned as 273.15 K and 1 atmosphere (1.01325 bar), 
under which 1 mole of ideal gas is equivalent to 22400 mL. With

concentration of species i and that of sweep gas (such as Ar), re- 
spectively; Q (mLmin -1 ) is the ﬂow rate of the sweep gas, and S 
(cm 2 ) is the effective surface area of the membrane. 

However, the issue with reporting permeation ﬂux ( J 

i ) is that J 
i 
is a function of both the intrinsic properties of the membrane and 
operating  condition  of  the  experiments  ( e.g.  feed-gas  concentra- 
tion, pressure, temperature, membrane thickness, etc.). Therefore, 
using J 
i to compare membrane’s performance obtained under dif- 
ferent operating conditions is not objective.

Barrer (1 Barrer = 10 −10  (cm 3 @STP cm)/(cm 2  s cm-Hg)) was early 
introduced as a practical unit for permeability for easy compari- 
son of the suitability of a material to be used for membrane gas 
separation. 

Derived from Permeability, Permeance ( P M ) is deﬁned as the 
ratio of the Permeability to the membrane thickness (L). It is anal- 
ogous to a mass transfer coeﬃcient for a given species permeating 
through the membrane at a given thickness.

P M  is  an  important  parameter  when  comparing  the  separa-

its  SI  unit,  a  practical  unit  often  used  is  GPU  (gas  permeation

In gas separation, the membrane selectivity ( α

ij ) (aka. perms- 
electivity) is used to compare the separating eﬃciency of a mem- 
brane for 2 (or more) species. It is deﬁned as the ratio of the per- 
meability or permeance or ﬂux of components i and j through the 
membrane:

For traditional size-exclusive membranes, α

ij is determined by 
the  relative  populations  of  various  pore  sizes,  actual  pore  size, 
molecule deformability, and molecular adsorption ability. The per- 
meation ability and selectivity of this class of membranes are sub- 
ject to Robeson’s upper bound rule. In contrast, CO 
2  is the only 
species transportable through the CO 
2 TMs due to the electrochem- 
ical nature. Therefore, CO 
2 TM has an inﬁnite theoretical selectiv- 
2 . However, in reality, there is always a certain level of 
ity to CO 
physical leakage through the imperfect sealing (pin holes, etc.) in 
presumably dense microstructure of the membrane. Therefore, α
for CO 
other species (e.g. N

3. CO 2 TM Materials and Performance Limiting Factors 

Following the fundamental insights from the above ﬂux equa- 
tions,  in  this  section,  we  mainly  focus  on  the  effects  of  materi- 
als, microstructures, thickness, surface modiﬁcation, and operating 
conditions on CO 

2 ﬂux and long-term stability. 

3.1. Materials 

CO 

2 TMs are consisted of a (or two) porous solid matrix ﬁlled 
with a molten carbonate (MC) phase. The latter serves as a carbon- 
ate ionic conductor and a sealant to make the membrane gastight. 
The solid matrix materials are porous metals or oxide-ionic con- 
ducting  ceramics,  providing  the  needed  electronic  and/or  oxide- 
ionic  conduction  and  charge-compensation  for  the  MC  phase. 

7 

Therefore,  solid  matrix  materials  must  satisfy  the  following  re- 
quirements: 1) oxide-ionic, or electronic, or mixed oxide-ionic and 
electronic conductor; 2) good wettability with MC; 3) chemically 
stable at high temperatures in CO 
2 -containing gases; 4) chemically 
compatible with MC phase; 5) high mechanical strength.

From the ﬂux equations Eqs. 2 , 6 and (9) , the CO 

2 ﬂux depends 
strongly on MC’s ionic conductivity. A commonly used MC is the 
ternary  eutectic  carbonate system  containing (Li-Na-K) 
3  with 
a  molar  ratio  of  43.5:31.5:25  [ 53 , 64 , 68 , 78 , 79 ]  and  melting  point 
of ∼397 °C. Some binary eutectic carbonates, such as (Li-Na)

For MOCC membranes, since the conductivity of MC is much 
higher  than  that  of  the  ceramic  oxide-ionic  conducting  phase 
[ 87 , 88 ],  the  oxide-ion  transport  controls  the  bulk  diffusion  pro- 
2  permeation process, while MC phase has a little 
cess in the CO 
2 ﬂux according to Eqs. (2 - 4 ). For example, Wade

3  binary carbonate and (Li- 
2 CO 
3  ternary carbonate in YSZ-MC membranes; similar CO 
Na-K) 
2 
ﬂuxes were observed at 750 °C [89] . If the membrane is operated 
in the temperature range of 40 0-50 0 °C, (Li-Na-K) 
3 ternary car- 
bonate is a better choice due to its low melting point. Otherwise, 
3  binary carbonate is a better choice due to its higher 
(Li-Na) 
ionic conductivity. The other physical and chemical properties of 
these MCs, such as viscosity, density, surface tension, and gas sol- 
ubility  are  similar.  Therefore,  MCs  show  less  effect  on  CO 
2  per- 
meation performance than the  oxide-ion  phase for  MOCC  mem- 
2 TMs  are  fo- 
branes.  As  such,  the  main  research  interests  on  CO 
cused  on  solid  matrix  materials,  including  oxide-ion  conductors, 
electron conductors, and mixed electron and oxide-ion conductors.

3  supported MOCC membrane cannot transport CO

2 
permeability of 5-6 × 10 −12 mol m −1 s −1 Pa −1 ( ∼0.133 mL min −1 
cm −2 in ﬂux) at 750 °C. However, YSZ has a low oxide-ionic con- 
ductivity, see Table 2 , and reacts irreversibly with lithium carbon- 
ate, forming lithium zirconate at a low CO 
2 partial pressure [89] . 
Therefore, YSZ is not a good matrix material for MOCC membranes 
either. 

2 CO 

The ﬂuorite structured BYS is known to have a higher oxide- 
ionic  conductivity  than  YSZ.  As  expected,  a  higher  CO 
2  ﬂux  of 
0.083 mL min −1  cm −2  ( ∼1.1 × 10 −8  mol m −2  s −1  Pa −1  in perme- 
ance)  was  observed  with  BYS-MC  ((Li-Na-K) 
3 )  membrane  at 
650 °C [63] , comparing to ∼ 0.01 mL min −1 cm −2 (0.12 × 10 −8 mol 
m −2 s −1 Pa −1 in permeance) of YSZ-MC membrane [89] . In addi- 
tion, CO 
2  ﬂux was increased by 2.5 times with the phase of BYS 
changing from rhombohedral to cubic structure due to the higher 
oxide-ionic conductivity of the latter. However, the reported CO 
2 
ﬂux  of  BYS-MC  membrane  is  lower  than  that  of  SDC  (or  GDC)- 
MC membrane [ 65 , 66 ], see Table 3 , even though BYS has a higher 
oxide-ion conductivity than SDC (or GDC). This is because the poor 
wettability  between  BYS  and  MC,  causing  the  pores  in  the  BYS 
matrix not being fully ﬁlled by MC to form continuous MC net- 
3 layer is required to over- 
work. Pore surfaces modiﬁcation by Al

To avoid the chemical compatibility problem between SS and 
MC,  silver  (Ag),  which  shows  not  only  a  higher  electronic  con- 
ductivity, but also better stability with MC, has been studied as a 
porous matrix material by Huang group [50] . A 6-fold higher CO

by the Ag-MC membrane at 650 °C with 41.67% CO

and 16.66% N 
as shown in Fig. 5 a, CO 
2 ﬂux also decays at high temperatures. The 
cause for the degradation was attributed to the sintering of porous 
silver matrix as indicated in Fig. 5 b and c [51] . Surface modiﬁca- 
tion and microstructural optimization were considered to improve 
the stability of the Ag-MC membranes, which will be described in 
detail in later sections.

Up to now, doped CeO 

2 [100] ) and operating conditions ( e.g. syngas [ 65 , 101 , 102 ], H 

2 are the best MOCC membrane matrix 
materials,  largely  due  to  their  high  oxide-ion  conductivity,  good 
chemical stability, chemical compatibility and wettability with MC 
at  high  temperatures.  Thus,  MOCC  membranes  based  on  doped 
CeO 
2 matrix are widely adopted to evaluate ﬂux stability [96] and 
effects  of  membrane  thickness  [97] ,  matrix  geometry  (plate  or

tio  in  SDC-MC  membranes,  Zhang  et  al.  [49]  reported  the  high- 
2  ﬂux density at an SDC:MC ratio of 50:50 vol%. In addi- 
est CO 
tion, the CO 
2 ﬂux calculated by Eq. (3) agrees well with those in- 
dependently measured values for a 1.2-mm-thick membrane, see 
Fig. 4 c, which proves that CO 
2 permeation is indeed controlled by 
the bulk oxide-ion transport. It was also found that disk-shaped 
SDC-MC membrane shows a higher CO 
2 ﬂux than tube-shaped one, 
see Fig. 4 d, due to a higher particle packing density of green bod- 
ies  (before  sintering)  in  disk  samples  than  tubular  counterparts

The  silver’s  coarsening  issue  is  diﬃcult  to  ﬁx  by  just  surface 
modiﬁcation,  and  the  high  cost  of  silver  is  another  concern  for 
practical applications. To solve this cost and sintering issues, Zhang 
et al. reported NiO as a new matrix material [106] . The long-term 
CO 
2 ﬂux and stability of NiO-MC shown in Fig. 5 d indicates a “pre- 
activation” period and a high ﬂux > 1.0 mL min −1 cm −2 at 850 °C. 
The “pre-activation” period was explained by the in situ formation 
2 (LNO) between the NiO ma- 
1.6 O 
of an interfacial phase of Li 
trix and MC phase, as schematically shown in Fig. 5 e. LNO has a 
high electronic conductivity ( ∼200 S cm −1 ) and can serve as an 
electron conductor [106] .

So  far,  only  few  materials  have  been  studied  as  the  matrix 
material for MECC membranes, due to the stringent requirements 
such as high electronic conductivity in oxidizing atmosphere, good 
chemical compatibility and thermal stability with MC at high tem- 
peratures.  The  CO 
2  ﬂuxes  of  the  reported  MECC  membranes  are 
summarized in Table 4 , in which the NiO-MC membrane shows the 
most promising prospects owing to its low cost, good thermal sta-

900 °C for a 375- μm-thick membrane, in which a CO

showing a fast decay in CO

Fig.  6 a.  The  degradation  was  attributed  to  the  reaction  between 
LSCF and CO

of a strontium carbonate layer which inhibits the surface reaction,

came more pronounced compared to the fresh one, suggesting the 
decomposition of LCGFA. In addition, the CO 
2 ﬂux is much lower 
than  the  reported  LSCF-MC  membrane,  largely  due  to  the  lower 
oxide-ion conductivity of LCGFA (0.03 S cm −1 at 900 °C) than LSCF

In  addition  to  the  single-phase  mixed  conductor  matrix  ma- 
terials, dual-phase porous matrices have also been developed for 
MEOCC membranes. Ce 
3- δ (SDC- 
SSAF)  was  previously  used  as  an  OTM  material,  exhibiting  high 
oxygen permeation ﬂux and good stability under a CO 
2  contain- 
ing atmosphere [118] . Thus, it was used as a matrix material for 
MEOCC membranes. A similar phenomenon of CO 
2 ﬂux enhance- 
ment  by  the  presence  of  O 
2  in  the  feed-gas  was  observed  [56] . 
NiO-SDC is another sample of composite porous matrix for MEOCC 
membranes [55] . The highly electronic conducting phase, LNO, is 
formed in situ between MC and NiO during high temperature op- 
eration and serves as the electron conducting phase, see Fig. 8 a, 
while SDC serves as the O 2 − conducting phase, making the mem- 
3 2 −. Such a triple 
brane simultaneously transport e −, O 2 −, and CO 
conduction mechanism is supported by the permeated CO 
2 to O

2  ﬂux  increases  from  1.04  to  1.34 
ﬂux  ratio,  see  Fig.  8 b.  The  CO 
mL  min −1  cm −2  as  CO 
2  concentration  increases  from  5  to  25%, 
2  ﬂux  was  enhanced  slightly  from  0.51  to  0.56  mL 
while  the  O

2 concentration from 5% to 10%, then 
2  ﬂux  reaches  1.17  mL 
followed  by  a  plateau.  The  maximum  CO 
min −1 cm −2 at 850 °C through a NiO-SDC-MC 1.2-mm-thick mem- 

brane.  A  200-h  ﬂux  stability  test  at  850  °C  shows  no  sign  of 
degradation. 

CO 

2 permeation performances through different MEOCC mem- 
branes  are  summarized  in  Table  5 .  Compared  to  Table  3  and  4 , 
MEOCC  membranes  exhibit  higher  CO 
2  ﬂuxes  than  MOCC  and 
2  in the feed-side is essential for 
MECC counterparts. However, O 
achieving  a  high  ﬂux,  yielding  a  mixture  of  O 
2  in  the 
2 -separation process, such as using OTMs, is 
sweep-side. Further O

needed to obtain a pure stream of CO

drogenation of ethane (ODHE) to produce ethylene [ 55 , 119 , 120 ].

3.2. Microstructure of solid matrix 

The  porous  solid  matrix  in  CO 

2 TMs  serves  for  two  purposes: 
conducting oxide-ion/electron and immobilizing MC phase. There- 
fore, its microstructural features such as porosity, tortuosity, triple- 
phase boundary density and pore size/distribution play a crucial 
role in ﬂux performance and long-term stability. For MOCC mem- 
branes, CO 
2 transport is governed by Eq. (2) , in which permeation 
ﬂux  is  a  function  of  microstructural  parameters  (porosity ε,  MC 
volume  ratio  ϕ,  and  tortuosity  τ ).  On  the  other  hand,  the  total

a  similar  effective  conductivity  for  MC  (Li-Na-K

matrix sintering temperature from 1100 to 10 0 0 °C, demonstrating 
the  signiﬁcant  effect  by  the  microstructure.  In  studying  the  mi- 
crostructural effect on CO

interconnected three-dimensional SDC matrix, see Fig. 9 a and 9 b, 
with a range of ε/ τ and porosity [49] . The results show that the

as the SDC porosity is increased from 30 to 50%, while ε/ τ is in- 
creased from 0.0123 to 0.234. 

For  dual-phase  membranes,  the  amount  of  each  phase  needs 
to be enough to form continuity in the bulk so that both phases 
exceed the percolation threshold for transport, i.e. ≥30% vol. for 
the minor phase [123] . Thus, the porosity ε (or solid fraction, 1- ε) 
shows insigniﬁcant difference in these porous solids, the tortuosity 
( τ ) vary in a wide range. For example, the tortuosity of a porous 
SDC matrix is shown to decrease from 26.1 to 2.27 as the porosity 
increases from 30 to 50% [49] , a trend that was also conﬁrmed by 
the LSCF matrix [121] , in which a decrease in tortuosity from 17.69 
to 2.56 is observed as the porosity is increased by decreasing the 
sintering temperature from 1100 to 10 0 0 °C. In addition, it was re- 
ported that the disk-type membrane shows a higher CO 
2 ﬂux than 
the tubular one even with the same thickness [67] . The authors at- 
tributed it to a better microstructure (the better connections of the 
particles in the disk than that in the tube) of the ceramic phase in 
disk-shaped membranes [67] . Therefore, how to optimize the tor- 
tuosity of the solid matrix is of criticality to maximizing CO 
2 ﬂux 
of MOCC membranes. 

Pore size is another important parameter to ensure high CO 
2 
2 TMs. On one hand, the capillary 
ﬂux and long-term stability for CO 
forces of a matrix to withhold MC phase is highly dependent on 
pore size according to the Laplace equation:

where γ , θ , and r are MC surface tension, contact angle between 
solid matrix and MC, and pore radius of solid matrix, respectively; 
(cid:4) (cid:4) 
p (cid:4) and p 
are  external  and  internal  pressures  across  pore,  respec- 
tively. Too large a pore would not generate enough capillary forces 
to withhold MC phase, thus leading to a loss of MC and degrada- 
tion of ﬂux. On the other hand, large pores in solid matrix also 
lead  to  a  low  density  of  triple  phase  boundaries  (TPBs),  result- 
ing  in  low  ﬂux  density.  Thus,  decreasing  pore  size  of  the  solid 
matrix is needed to enhance both ﬂux and long-term stability of 
CO 

2 TMs. 
The effect of Ag-matrix pore size in Ag-MC membranes on per- 
meation  performance  was  studied  by  varying  pore  formers  with 
different  pore  sizes,  e.g.  microcrystalline  methylcellulose  (15-20 
μm)  vs.  carbon  black  (10  μm)  [ 69 , 107 ].  The  microstructures  of 
these silver matrices are compared in Fig. 9 c and 9 d. The ﬂux re- 
sults show a roughly 1.5 times improvement in CO 
2  ﬂux at 500- 
650  °C,  e.g.  from  0.24  to  0.37  mL  min −1  cm −2  at  600  °C,  by 
switching  pore  formers  from  microcrystalline  methylcellulose  to 
carbon black. The chemical/electrochemical dealloying technology, 
a well-established method to produce nanoporous metal structures 
for various applications [124] , was used to decrease the pore size 
and promote uniform pore distribution of Ag matrix. As shown in 
Fig. 9 e- 9 h, the microstructures of such prepared Ag matrix (with 
an average pore size of 1-5 μm) have led to a CO 
2 ﬂux as high as 
0.52 mL min −1 cm −2 at 600 °C [ 52 , 109 ]. 

The  pore  size  was  also  found  to  inﬂuence  the  stability  of 
CO 
2 ﬂux at 650 °C 
2 TMs. For example, a very fast degradation of CO 
after 20 h on-stream was observed on an Ag-MC membrane com- 
prising of an Ag matrix with 15-20 μm pore size [107] . With the 
pore size decreasing to 10 μm, the degradation started after 160 h 
on-stream at 600 °C [69] and after 30 h at 650 °C [50] . However, 
with pore size of 1-5 μm, no obviously degradation was observed 
during a 220-h testing at 600 °C with Ar sweep gas [109] and a 
2 -Ar sweep gas [52] . The main 
500-h testing at 600 °C with 9.44% H 

14 

mechanism for CO 
2 TMs degradation is the loss of MC during test, 
which is likely related to the sintering of Ag grains at high tem- 
peratures. As the loss of MC continues and accumulates, the gas 
tightness of membrane and continuity of MC phase will be com- 
promised [69] . 

3.3. Membrane thickness effect 

From a membrane transport perspective, the ﬂux of an active 
species through a membrane is controlled by both surface reaction 
and bulk diffusion. Zhu et al. [ 75 , 76 ] modeled the two processes 
in series with a resistors equivalent circuit model, see Eqs. (10) - 
(14) . The relevant importance of each process to the overall ﬂux is 
determined by the “Critical Thickness”, which is the ratio between 
bulk diffusivity (cm 2 /s) and surface exchange rate (cm/s) of the ac- 
tive species. A general rule is that the thinner the membrane, the 
more control of surface exchange, and the faster the surface ex- 
change rate the thinner the membrane can be with bulk diffusion 
control. Therefore, a greater Critical Thickness may be expected for 
CO 
2 TMs than for proton and oxygen transport membranes due to 
the slower surface exchange rate of CO 

2 . 

A  critical  thickness  of  0.84  mm  was  reported  for  an  Ag-MC 
membrane [69] , which means that a further decrease in thickness 
2  ﬂux. Under 
below 0.84 mm would not signiﬁcantly improve CO 
this condition, one should improve the surface exchange rate by 
applying catalyst or changing operating conditions or optimizing 
microstructure to favor surface reaction. The surface control was 
also conﬁrmed by Dong et al. [97] , in which the CO 
2 ﬂux of SDC- 
3 membrane was compared in a thickness range of 0.15 
Li/Na/K 
and 1.5 mm. It was found that the 0.15-mm-thick membrane ex- 
hibited only 3 times higher CO 
2  ﬂux than the 1.5-mm-thick one, 
but not 10 times as expected from the bulk-control ﬂux equation, 
due to the involvement of surface exchange reaction in the overall 
CO 

2 permeation process [97] .

Despite the fact of surface CO 

2 exchange control, there are still 
many effort s to develop thin-ﬁlm membrane for enhanced perfor- 
mance. Lu et al. [78] prepared an asymmetrical MOCC membrane 
with a thin, small pore (40% porosity, 0.05 μm in diameter), 10- 
μm-thick YSZ layer on a thick, large pore (30-40% porosity, 0.2 μm 
in diameter) MC-non-wettable BYS support. A CO 
2 ﬂux of 0.524 mL 
min −1  cm −2  was achieved at 650 °C, which is roughly 10 times 
higher  than  the  20 0-40 0 μm  thick  membrane.  But  the  increase 
of CO 
2  ﬂux is far less than the expected 20-40 times, suggesting 
the limitation from surface exchange. Another evidence of the sur- 
face  exchange  limitation  is  the  activation  energy  of  CO 
2  perme- 
ation process through a thinner YSZ-MC membrane, 106 kJ mol −1 
vs.  ∼84  kJ  mol −1  for  a  thicker  counterpart.  This  trending  is  un- 
derstandable because the overall CO 
2 permeation through a MOCC 
membrane is controlled by both surface reaction and bulk diffu- 
sion,  and  the  activation  energy  for  surface  reaction  is  generally 
higher  than  that  of  bulk  diffusion  process  [ 53 , 78 ].  For  a  thicker 
2 permeation is mainly limited by the bulk dif- 
membrane, the CO 
fusion process, thus exhibiting a lower activation energy than the 
thinner membrane where surface reaction dominates. The critical 
thickness of the YSZ-MC membrane was suggested to be > 10 μm, 
larger than YSZ-based oxygen permeation membranes ( < 10 μm) 
[125] . The presence of MC and/or different surface morphologies 
may be the underlying causes. 

3.4. Feed gas concentration effect 

3.4.1. CO 2 partial pressure 

From  the  CO 

2  ﬂux  equation  of  Eqs.  (2) - (9) ,  CO 

2  partial  pres- 
2 TMs is the major driving force for the CO 
sure gradient across CO 
2 
2  partial pressure gradient, the 
transport. Thus, the higher the CO 
2  ﬂux, which has been conﬁrmed by many studies 
higher the CO 
2 partial pressure under ambient as 
[ 61 , 65 , 66 , 69 , 91 ]. Increasing CO 
2 ﬂux. For example, for 
well as pressurized conditions increases CO 
2  ﬂux 
a 1.5-mm-thick SDC-MC membrane operated at 900 °C, CO 
increases from 0.39 to 0.79 mL min −1 cm −2 as the feed-side CO 
2 
partial pressure is increased from 0.1 to 0.9 atm. The ﬂux is also 

increased from 0.17 to 0.43 mL min −1 cm −2 as the total pressure 
at the feed side is increased from 1 to 5 atm (with a ﬁxed 50 vol% 
CO 

2 concentration) at 700 °C [65] . 
Varying  CO 

2  partial  pressure  across  the  membrane  has  also 
2  permeation  mechanisms.  The

relationship between CO

3.4.2. H 2 partial pressure 

Another way to enhance CO 

2 ﬂux of membranes is to decrease 
the partial pressure of oxygen at the sweep or feed side. For MOCC 
membranes, it can be done by adding H 
2  into the feed-side gas. 
Since  O 2 − is  transported  from  the  sweep  side  to  feed  side,  the 
2 at the feed-side creates a low oxygen partial pres- 
presence of H 
sure environment, thus promoting oxide-ion ﬂux and subsequently

2  is mixed with H 

increasing  CO 
2  ﬂux  in  the  opposite  direction  due  to  the  charge 
neutrality requirement. From this point of view, MOCC membranes

are more suited for capturing CO

served by Chen et al. [127] . 
On the other hand, if H

sands ppm in the ﬂue gas produced from coal-ﬁred power plants. 
2 TMs determine the stability and thus lifetime of 
Its effects on CO 
2  directly from ﬂue gas. Unfortunately, 
membranes to capture CO 
MC can spontaneously react with SO 
2 even at a concentration as 
low as 20 ppm, forming sulfates. The formed sulfate decreases the 
conductivity of carbonate-ion in MC, leading to the degradation of 
2 ﬂux [100] . So far, there is no effective way to resolve this prob- 
CO 
lem.  Therefore,  SO 
2  must  be  removed  from  ﬂue  gas  prior  to  its 
contact with CO

Surface  modiﬁcation  is  a  common  method  to  enhance  sur- 
face reactions/properties without changing the bulk properties. For 
CO 
2 TMs, it has been adopted to improve the wettability of solid 
matrix with MC phase so that MC phase can be effectively retained 
within the solid porous structure. The ideal material of choice for

with zero contact angle and the benchmark electrolyte matrix ma- 
terial for molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) [137-141] . During the 
development of CO

4 2 − in MC has been previously proposed via “cogwheel”
tion of CO

for the enhanced oxygen ﬂux is that Al

of the MC, which improves oxygen dissolution at the TPBs to favor 
the CO

Ag  matrix  against  sintering  [51] .  Such  an  Ag-MC  membrane  can 
operate  stably  at  higher  temperatures  ( >  700  °C),  see  Fig.  15 c, 
which  makes  CO 
2  capture  and  conversion  at  high  enough  tem- 
peratures  in  a  single  reactor  possible.  In  the  following  section, 
we will demonstrate a dry-oxy CH

membrane.

Another example of using surface modiﬁcation to improve wet- 
tability of the porous matrix with MC is the BYS-MC membrane. 
BYS is known to be the best oxide-ion conductor, but it is unfor- 
tunately  non-wettable  to  MC.  To  improve  the  wettability  of  BYS 
3 was coated over BYS pore surfaces 
with MC, a thin layer of Al 
2 ﬂux than SDC-MC 
[63] . However, as shown in Table 3 , a lower CO 
membrane was observed, even though BYS has a higher oxide-ion 
conductivity than SDC [ 49 , 95 ]. One possible reason for the lower 
2  ﬂux is low ε/ τ ratio of the porous BYS matrix and lowered 
CO 
porosity (20-30%) by surface modiﬁcation. Another possible reason 
is that the surface coating may hinder the reaction. Thus, there ex- 
ist rooms to improve CO 
2 ﬂux by optimizing the microstructure of 
BYS. 

An interesting study of surface modiﬁcation is to apply a cata- 
lyst layer on the membrane surface to promote surface reactions, 
2 TMs.  A 
which  is  particularly  effective  to  surface  controlled  CO 
higher CO 
2 ﬂux was achieved by coating Au-Pd (46:54 at.%) metal- 
lic  particles  on  the  feed  surface  of  a  dense  MEOCC  (SDC-SSAF- 
MC) membrane [122] . Fig. 16 a shows the proposed CO 
2 permeation 
2  at the feed side, the catalytic 
mechanism. In the presence of O 
activity provided by Au-Pd particles promote the reduction of O 
2 
into O 2 −, which further reacts with CO 
3 2 −, leading to 
2 ﬂux (from 0.28 to 0.35 mL min −1 cm −2 ) with 
an increase in CO 
O 
2 at

CH 

4 reforming with CO 

2 as an oxidizer to produce syngas (H 
2 
and CO) represents one of the most important chemical reactions 
to  mitigate  global  warming  effect  because  it  utilizes  two  most 
powerful greenhouse gases. Commonly known as dry methane re- 
forming (DMR), the reaction produces a syngas composition with 
H 

2 :CO = 1:1 at the expense of high thermal energy [143-146] : 

CO 2 + CH 4 = 2CO + 2H 2 , (cid:4)H o 

298K = 247 kJ mol −1 

(21) 

The  H 

2 :CO  = 1:1 syngas  is  ideal for  the  synthesis  of  valuable 
oxygenated chemicals and long-chain hydrocarbons [147] . Coking 
is a major issue for DMR to scale up to the commercial level. In 
addition,  DMR  reaction  requires  pure  CO 
2 ,  which  is  a  commod- 
ity  produced  from  rather  expensive  industrial  processes  such  as 
“amine chemical washing”, not to mention that compression and 
transportation of the CO 
2  to a DMR site add extra costs. Use of 
2 capture and conversion offers a low-cost solution 
CO 
to DMR, i.e. the captured hot CO 
2 at power plants can be directly 
converted on-site into valuable products such as syngas, avoiding 
compression and transportation and thus saving cost and energy. 

2 TMs for CO 

The combined CO 

2 capture and DMR process was ﬁrst theoret- 
ically studied using an LSCF-MC tubular membrane reactor [148] , 
4 are fed into shell and tube sides, re- 
in which a ﬂue gas and CH 
spectively, with catalyst packed on the CH 
4 side. During operation, 
2 permeates from the shell side to the tube side and reacts with 
CO 
4 con- 
4 to produce syngas. The modeled results showed that CH 
CH 
2 ﬂux can be as high as 48.06% and 1.52 mL min −1 
version and CO 
cm −2 at 800 °C, respectively, for a 0.075-mm-thick membrane un- 
4  space velocity of 3265.31 h −1  and CO 
der the condition of CH 
2 
partial pressure of 1 atm. The study also showed that adding O 
2 
into shell side will further improve reactor’s performance.

The DMR performance was experimentally demonstrated in a 
2  conversion  as  high  as 
LSCF-MC  membrane  reactor  [149] .  A  CO 
88.5%  was  achieved  with  a  packed  Ni/ γ -Al 
3  catalyst,  and  the 
2  conversion increases in the order of: blank system (without 
CO 
catalyst) < LSCF combustion catalyst < Ni/ γ -Al 
3 catalyst, due to 
the increased catalytic activity. However, the chemical interaction 
between  LSCF  and  CO 
2  eventually  led  to  stability  issue.  In  con- 
trast, with a GDC-MC membrane reactor loaded with a Ni-MgO- 
1 wt% Pt (NMP) catalyst and a LaNi 
3- δ (LNF) catalyst, see 
Fig. 17 a, Zhang et al. demonstrated a much improved DMR perfor- 
mance [92] . At 850 °C, over NMP and LNF catalysts, the two mem- 
brane  reactors  showed  syngas  production  rates  of  6.99  and  6.10 
mL min −1  cm −2 , and CH 
4  conversions of 93.9% and 73%, respec- 
tively. By comparison, the LNF catalyst exhibited a stronger coking 
and coarsening resistances than NMP catalyst, and thus a better 
long-term stability. No sign of degradation within 200-h of oper- 
ation was observed for the membrane reactor with LNF catalyst, 
see Fig. 17 b. Ni nanoparticles exsolved from LNF lattice under re- 
ducing environments are the underlying reason for the observed 
pre-activation behavior and sustained catalytic activity because ex- 
solution process takes time and the lattice Ni is free of coarsening. 
Compared to Ar sweep gas, the CO 
2 ﬂux is further increased with 
4 sweep gas owing to the in situ DMR reaction that consumes 
CH 
2 and shifts the equilibrium of the reaction. For 
the permeated CO 
example, at 850 °C and over NMP catalyst, the CO 
2  ﬂux was in- 
creased from 0.67 to 2.25 mL min −1 cm −2 at a CO 
2 conversion rate 
of 96% by switching the sweep gas from pure Ar to 3.57% CH 
4 -Ar 
mixture [92] . 
The H 

2 /CO ratio of the produced syngas by the above reactor 
was generally lower than 1, largely due to the concurrent reverse

MECC  membranes  have  a  fundamental  advantage  over  MOCC 
2 , si- 
for methane reforming because they can transport CO 
2  not only mitigates coking, but 
multaneously. The presence of O 
also provides the heat resulted from partial oxidation reaction for 
DMR.  Such  a  reaction  is  commonly  known  as  dry-oxy  methane 
reforming  (denoted  as  DOMR),  see  Fig.  18 a.  Due  to  the  high- 
temperature requirement, an Ag-MC MECC membrane overcoated 
2 was used in a reactor packed with the NMP catalyst 
with ALD-ZrO 
[119] . During operation, the sweep gas (CH 
4 ) reacts with both CO 
2 
2  permeated  in  the  MECC  membrane  reactor,  producing  a 
and  O 
syngas with a higher H 
2 /CO ratio. The performance of MOCC-DMR 
and MECC-DOMR membrane reactors are compared in Fig. 18 b, in 
which the same catalyst NMP was used, but the reactor tempera- 
ture was 800 °C for the MECC membrane reactor to ensure mini- 
mal silver sintering and 850 °C for the MOCC membrane reactor. 
Thermodynamically,  coking  is  more  favorable  to  form  at  800  °C 
2 and CO linearly increases 
than 850 °C. The production rates of H 
with methane concentration for the MECC membrane reactor as a 
sign of free coking, but this is not the case for the MOCC mem- 
brane  reactor,  implying  that  the  MECC  membrane  reactor  has  a 
better coking resistance than the MOCC counterpart.

magnitude in a temperature range of 740 to 800 °C, see Fig. 18 c, 
suggesting both thermodynamics and kinetics play active roles in 
the  laboratory-scale  DOMR  reactor.  However,  one  issue  for  Ag- 
based  MECC  membrane  reactors  is  the  poor  long-term  stabil- 
ity  caused  by  the  Ag-sintering  over  the  extended  period,  even 
with ALD-ZrO

Ag  and  ALD  coating  process  are  also  the  concerns  for  practical 
applications.

In searching for low-cost and stable MECC membranes, NiO-MC 
2  ﬂux and good 
membrane was reported to exhibit a high CO 
stability at 850 °C [106] ; the latter matches well with DOMR re- 
action temperature. However, the reduction of NiO into Ni metal 
under a reducing atmosphere induces volume shrinkage and thus 
causes loss of MC and poor stability. To address this problem [55] , 
a  triple-phase  NiO-SDC-MC  membrane  was  developed  in  labora- 
tory. A stable CO 
2  ﬂux and high DOMR performance over the 
NMP catalyst were achieved. During the initial period of operation, 
NiO  ﬁrst  reacts  with  MC  phase  to  form  an  electron-conducting 
phase LNO at high temperatures. Meanwhile, SDC and MC provide 
oxide-ion and carbonate-ion conductivities, respectively. At 850 °C, 
such a MEOCC membrane reactor was demonstrated with a syngas 
production rate of 7.4 mL min −1  cm −2  and CH 
2  conver- 
sion rate of 84.1 and 62.9%, respectively. No degradation was ob- 
served on the reactor for 130 h [55] . Similarly, a good DMR perfor-

4.2. Coupling with ethane dehydrogenation 

Ethylene is one of the most important chemical commodities 
to our modern society. Commercial production of ethylene is high- 
temperature ( > 900 °C) non-catalytic thermal dehydrogenation of 
either ethane or naphtha in the presence of steam, a process com- 
monly  known  as  Steam  Cracking  (SC)  [154] .  Technically,  a  com- 
mercial steam cracker operated above 900 °C can achieve a sin- 
gle  pass  ∼70%  conversion  with  ∼ 50%  yield  with  ethane  as  the 
feedstock [155] . However, the thermal dehydrogenation of ethane 
(TDHE) process is highly endothermic, consuming ∼22 GJ of en- 
ergy  and  emitting  1.5  ton  of  CO 
2  per  ton  of  ethylene  produced 
[156] . In addition, SC reactors need frequent shutdowns to decoke, 
resulting in high costs in operation and maintenance. One way to

decrease ethylene production cost and carbon emissions is to boost 
TDHE kinetics by catalysts, so that the operation temperature can 
be lowered. However, due to the thermodynamic constraint at low 
temperatures, the equilibrium ethane conversion is rather low, e.g. 
15% at 600 °C and 40% at 650-700 °C [157] . Therefore, development 
of advanced ethylene production technologies is still needed. 

Oxidative  dehydrogenation  of  ethane  (ODHE)  is  a  promising 
technology  to  convert  ethane  into  ethylene  with  lower  energy, 
higher ethane conversion rate and less coking [158] . Both O 
2 and 
2 have been used as oxidants for ODHE. A nearly 100% ethane 
CO 
conversion can be achieved with pure O 
2 as the oxidant. However, 
it is diﬃcult to avoid deep oxidation of ethylene since ethylene is 
chemically more reactive than ethane. Other issues associated with 
2 -ODHE are thermal management with excessive heat, uncontrol- 
O 
lable local combustion, and cost for pure O 
2 [159-161] . In compar- 
ison, CO 
2 with a weaker oxidizing power has the ability to convert 
ethane to ethylene without over-oxidation. The co-fed ODHE reac- 
tors, however, often produce a stream with low concentration of 
ethylene and high concentration of CO 
2 due to the use of high in- 
6  ratio ( > 3/1) to avoid carbon deposition [162-164] . 
let CO 
The low concentration of ethylene product increases the cost for 
downstream puriﬁcation.

It is important to note that membrane reactors present an in- 
herent advantage over conventional co-fed ODHE reactor systems. 
They operate under a continuous mode and add reactants and re- 
move  products  incrementally  along  the  length  of  a  tubular  plug 
ﬂow  membrane reactor,  thus  enhancing conversion and selectiv- 
ity. This feature has a potential to simplify the downstream ethy- 
lene puriﬁcation process, which is a signiﬁcant cost item for com- 
mercial  ethylene  production.  OTM  reactors  were  the  ﬁrst  mem- 
brane  systems  tried  for  O 
2 - 
ethane systems [ 159 , 161 , 165 ], and a remarkable performance has 
been  obtained  at  high  temperatures  ( ≥ 800  °C).  For  example, 
a  Bi 
3- δ tubular  membrane  reactor  was  reported  for 
ODHE  with  an  ethane  conversion  of  56%  and  ethylene  selectiv- 
ity  of  80%  at  875  °C  [159] .  On  another  case,  a  mixed  conduct- 
3- δ (BCFZ) hollow-ﬁber OTM membrane reac- 
ing BaCo x Fe y Zr 
tor was also reported for ODHE with similar performance at 800 
°C [166] . However, a critical challenge for these OTM membrane 
reactors  to  be  practical  is  their  poor  chemical  stability  in  CO 
2 - 
containing atmospheres [166] .

2 TM reactors can capture CO 

2 through RWGS reaction, thus enhancing C 

2 and instantly use it as a soft 
oxidizer to convert ethane into ethylene in single catalytic mem- 
brane  reactor.  One  advantage  is  the  excellent  chemical  stability 
of  CO

ing resistance. Such a combined CO 
successfully demonstrated in laboratory by using a GDC-MC mem- 
3 /ZSM-5 catalyst [120] . The 
brane reactor loaded with a 5 wt% Cr 
reactor  achieved a  ∼75%  C 
2  conversion 
and  ∼82%  C 
6 -Ar  as  the 
4  selectivity  at  800  °C  with  4.0%  C 
2 H 
sweep gas. The results shown in Fig. 19 b suggest that without CO 
2 
and/or catalyst the conversion is primarily dominated by TDHE re- 
action, suffering severe coking even though the initial C 
4 yield 
2  and catalyst, the main ethylene 
is higher. In the presence of CO 
production  route  is  still  TDHE  reaction,  but  the  permeated  CO 
2 
can effectively lift carbon through the RB reaction and remove H 
2 
through RWGS reaction. The major reaction pathways under each 
condition are proposed in Fig. 19 c. Due to the concurrent RWGS 
shifting  TDHE  equilibrium  and  RB  reaction  lifting  coke,  a  good 
long-term stability was achieved, see Fig. 19 d. The SEM microstruc-

4.3. Coupling with H 2 enrichment process 

Pre-combustion CO 

2  capture from integrated gasiﬁcation com- 
bined cycle (IGCC) coal-ﬁred power plants has attracted consider- 
able attention in recent decades because of its carbon-free com- 
bustion process. In a typical IGCC power cycle, coal is ﬁrst steam- 
gasiﬁed at high temperatures ( ∼1500 °C) to produce high pressure 
( ∼30 bars) syngas. The water gas shift (WGS) reaction is then used 
to convert CO/H 
2 and 
2  via a room tempera- 
2  stream. H 
H 
ture pressure swing process over solid sorbents and ﬁnally used 
for carbon-free combustion. Given the fact that the WGS reaction 
is exothermic, low temperature operation is thermodynamically fa- 
vored but with a penalty in kinetics and loss of thermal energy in 
the gasiﬁed syngas.

actors were ﬁrst studied as an approach to separating H 
2 
2 + H 
in WGS gas, aiming to shift WGS reaction (H 
2 ) to 
the right-hand side in the reactor and producing a high-pressure 
2 TM  reactors  can 
CO 
produce a high-pressure H 
2 from WGS 
gas, while shifting WGS equilibrium; the produced high-pressure 
H 
2 TM 
over HTM is its better stability. Pd-based HTMs are known to have 
high-temperature stability issue. Moreover, at high operating tem- 
peratures, no catalyst is needed for WGS because of suﬃciently fast 
kinetics, thus further simplifying the reactor design. A schematic of 
catalyst-free, MOCC membrane reactor for syngas WGS is concep- 
tually shown in Fig. 20 a [101] . 

2  is better suited for combustion. Another advantage of CO 

2 retentate by removing CO 

The  initial  performance  at  900  °C  of  such  MOCC-based  syn- 
gas WGS tubular reactor is encouraging: 0.36 mL min −1  cm −2  of 
single-pass  CO 
2  recovery  ﬂux  and  26.1%  of  CO  conversion  [101] . 
This  level  of  performance  is  much  better  than  the  conventional 
ﬁxed-bed  reactors  under  identical  conditions,  see  Fig.  20 b.  The 
study  also  suggests that  increasing the  pressure  of  reaction  side 
is an effective way to enhance CO conversion and CO 
2  recovery. 
In addition, SDC-MC membrane reactor exhibits excellent thermal 
2  separation 
and  chemical  stability  under  WGS  reaction  and  CO 
conditions, promising the durability of WGS reactors for combined 
H 

2 production and CO 

2 capture. 

The H 

2 enrichment from the WGS process is further expanded 
to steam reforming of methane (SRM) process; a schematic of the 
reactor is shown in Fig. 20 c [168] . An asymmetric membrane with

reactors.

5. Challenges and Potential Solutions 

Despite the intrinsic advantages ( e.g. in selectivity, permeabil- 
ity,  modularity,  scalability,  continuity,  simplicity,  etc.)  of  electro- 
chemical CO 
2 TMs and associated reactors over current benchmark 
sorption-based  methods,  and  their  potentials  to  be  an  energy- 
eﬃcient and cost-effective technology for combined CO 
2  capture 
and conversion, the current development of CO 
2 TMs and reactors 
is still limited at laboratory level. Demonstrations at bench-, pilot- 
scale and ultimately commercial scale require strong R&D activities 
to overcome the following key challenges. 

24 

5.1. Key challenges 

The most critical challenge for the current CO 

2 TMs and reac- 
tors R&D is to achieve meaningful long-term stability at the high- 
2  ﬂux possible. From an application perspective, long-term 
est CO 
ﬂux stability is more important than the magnitude of ﬂux. So far, 
the longest stability testing demonstrated at a laboratory scale is 
roughly 10 0 0 hours. The reason for poor stability is multiple, but 
the loss of MC caused by the poor wettability between the solid 
matrix and MC, and solid matrix sintering is deemed the primary 
reason leading to discontinuity of MC phase and increase in the 
leakage, ultimately decay in CO 
2 ﬂux. The secondary reason is the 
chemical reactions between gas sealants (Ag, ceramic bond, glass, 
etc.) and MC. The reliability of sealing materials needs to be care- 
fully considered when designing large-cell stacks and reactors as- 
sembly for practical use. Lessons learned from the mature molten 
carbonate fuel cells technology about the cell/stack/reactor design 
should be leveraged. 

To achieve the durability suitable for scale-up demonstrations, 

the following areas need to be further advanced. 

5.2. Membrane materials 

CO 

2 TMs are constructed with a solid porous matrix ﬁlled with 
a liquid MC phase. For solid porous matrix in MOCC membranes, 
doped ceria oxides (SDC, GDC etc.) are identiﬁed as the best ma- 
terials due to their high oxide-ion conductivity and good wettabil- 
2 S and SO 
ity with MC. However, their chemical reaction with H 
2 
impurities  in  ﬂue  gas  or  WGS  gas  hinders  their  practical  appli- 

P. Zhang, J. Tong, K. Huang et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100888 

cations. Therefore, ﬁnding new solid matrix materials with good 
oxide-ion conductivity and chemical stability in sulfur-containing 
environments are highly desirable for MOCC membranes develop- 
ment. 

For  MECC  membranes,  Ag-based  matrix  has  been  previously 
studied.  The  sintering  issue  of  Ag  at  high  temperatures  hinders 
its large-scale applications. Surface modiﬁcations and microstruc- 
tural optimization are still insuﬃcient to improve its stability to 
the  level  of  practical  applications,  not  to  mention  the  high  cost 
of  Ag.  Therefore,  more  studies  are  needed  to  understand  the 
composition-ﬂux-stability relationship in new low-cost and high- 
ﬂux NiO-based MECC membrane materials. The drawback of the 
NiO-MC membrane is its poor stability in reducing atmospheres. 
While adding SDC into NiO-MC membranes can improve the stabil- 
ity and enable trip-conduction, the presence of SDC phase reduces 
NiO volume, thus resulting in lowered electronic conductivity. Op- 
timization of phase volume among SDC, NiO and MC is needed for 
scale up demonstration. Alternatively, introducing electronic con- 
duction  in  SDC  phase  while  maintaining  good  chemical  stability 
and wettability with MC will mitigate the requirement for more 
NiO volume to provide enough electronic conduction. 

A fundamental problem associated with MC-based CO 

2 TMs is 
the thermal stability of molten carbonates at high temperatures. 
Thermodynamic calculations indicate that Li-Na-K carbonate sys- 
tem,  regardless  binary  or  ternary,  would  decompose  into  oxide 
by giving off CO 
2 -lean environments. Therefore, the upper 
temperature limit at which molten carbonates can be stably used 
needs further experimental veriﬁcations.

5.3. Microstructure/surface treatment 

Pore size, pore distribution, porosity and tortuosity of the solid 
matrix have a signiﬁcant impact on the performance (ﬂux and sta- 
bility)  of  CO 
2 TMs.  First,  they  determine  the  magnitude  of  capil- 
lary forces to withhold the MC phase. The ﬁner and more uniform 
the pores the higher the capillary forces and the higher pressure- 
differential under which the MC phase can withstand; the latter is 
vitally important to achieve long-term ﬂux stability for pressurized 
operations such as CO 
2  removal from a pressurized WGS stream. 
On the other hand, since the ratio of porosity to tortuosity ( ε/ τ ) is 
directly related to the effective conductivity of CO 
2 TMs, its magni- 
tude also governs CO 
2 ﬂux in a bulk-diffusion controlled transport. 
New synthesis methods are still being sought to fabricate low-cost, 
homogenously porous solid matrix with tortuous, small, and uni- 
formly distributed pores. On the other hand, modifying the surface 
of CO 
2 exchange kinetics as well as wet- 
tability between solid and MC phase remains an unexplored area. 

2 TMs that can improve CO 

5.4. CO 2 capture and conversion 

2 TMs  from  other  CO 

One  distinct  feature  of  CO 

2  capture  and 
conversion methods is the coupling of CO 
2 capture with conversion 
in  a  single  membrane  reactor  at  high  temperatures.  Up  to  now, 
2 TMs reactors, i.e. coupling with DMR, ODHE and WGS, are 
all CO 
demonstrated at laboratory scale. Demonstrating ﬂux and stability 
performance at bench-top and pilot scales are the vital tasks to ad- 
vance electrochemical CO 

2 TM systems toward commercialization. 

Another area worth further study is the application of catalysts 
directly to the membrane surface, instead of in a separate bed in- 
side the reactor, to better promote CO 
2 conversion. However, how 
to effectively load solid catalysts onto molten carbonate surface has 
not been explored yet. Supported thin-ﬁlm membranes may offer 
a solution to this problem as the catalyst can be decorated to the 
surface of the thick solid porous support that is free of MC. 

25 

5.5. Flux equation for triple-conducting membranes 

The  ﬂux  of  a  mixed  conducting  transport  in  CO 

2 TMs  is  in- 
ﬂuenced  by  both  surface  reaction  mechanisms  and  bulk  proper- 
ties/microstructures. The latter is particularly important for multi- 
phase transport because the volumetric fraction of each phase and 
tortuosity could signiﬁcantly affect the ﬂux. While the mechanisms 
2  ionization at gas-liquid and gas-solid interfaces in 
of surface CO 
MOCCs and MECCs seem to be straightforward, the triple conduc- 
3 2 −/O 2 −/e −)  in  multiphase  membranes  would  require  a 
tion  (CO 
new set of ﬂux formalisms deriving from the generic Eq. (1) to de- 
scribe the transport ﬂux. Equally important is to model the cou- 
2  by  combining  the  ﬂux 
pling  of  capture  and  conversion  of  CO 
equation with the rate kinetics of catalytic reactions and bound- 
ary conditions in membrane reactors. 

5.6. Physics-based modeling and system analysis 

The early discussion in section 2.2 on CO 

2  ﬂux as well as the 
early  work  on  CO 
2  transport  modeling follows  closely  the  tradi- 
tional  phenomenological  transport  theory,  which  is  largely  lim- 
ited  to  one-dimension  and  ignores  mechanistic  details  on  bulk 
transport  and  surface  reaction.  With  a  physics-based  approach, 
the  bulk  transport  and  surface  reactions  through  CO 
2 TM  can  be 
modeled  with  rich  physiochemical  details  in  high  dimensional- 
ity and better accuracy. Unfortunately, such physics-based multi- 
2 TMs 
dimensional models have so far not been demonstrated in CO 
and the associated catalytic reactors. Instead, several system-level 
models  have  been  published  to  demonstrate  the  advantages  of 
CO 
2 TM  reactors  in  energy  eﬃciency  and  cost  over  conventional 
technologies.  For  example,  Fang  et  al.  [169]  performed  a  lifecy- 
2 TM reactor system consist- 
cle techno-economic analysis of a CO 
ing of a MECC membrane and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) 
for  combined  CO 
2  capture  and  conversion  to  syngas  and  to  liq- 
uid synthetic fuel, and compared its techno-economic performance 
with renewable-based syngas-to-liquid technologies. Fig. 22 shows 
the process ﬂow diagram. The analysis shows a  parasitic energy 
of  321  kJ/kg  CO 
2  capture, 
which is half of that consumed by a typical amine washing plant. 
It  also  shows  that  an  increase  in  SOEC  surface  area  results  in 
a decreased parasitic energy while not signiﬁcantly affecting the 
system  eﬃciency.  The  analysis  further  shows  that  the  price  of 
synthetic fuels produced from MECC-SOEC system is competitive 
with that of biomass-to-liquid (BTL) fuel at an electricity price of 
$ 0.096/kwh.

The process is capable to capture at least 90% of the CO 

2 gen- 
erated by the power plant. With recovery of excess process heat 
for electricity production, the CO 
2 capture process after add-on to 
an existing power plant has an energy penalty of about 12%, which 
is less than DOE’s expectation (a parasitic energy load no greater 
than 20%). This energy penalty is better than other advanced post- 
combustion  CO 
2  capture  processes,  such  as  polymer  membrane- 
based  CO 
2  capture  (16%  energy  penalty)  [170]  and  amine-based 
absorption  systems  (26-41%  energy  penalty)  [171] .  However,  the 
cost  of  additional  capture  system  exceeds  the  DOE’s  cost  target 
($210/ton CO 

2 capture vs. $42/ton CO 

2 capture).

3 ) is the best choice for its 
low  eutectic  point.  However,  at  a  high  temperature  range  (550- 
3  binary  carbonate  is  a  better  choice  due  to 
900  °C),  (Li-Na) 
its higher carbonate-ion conductivity. For matrix materials used in 
MOCC membranes, doped ceria oxides (SDC, GDC etc.) are the best 
solid oxide-ion conducting materials. However, their chemical re- 
2 impurities in ﬂue gas hinders their prac- 
action with H 
tical applications. For MECC membranes, Ag is a good option for 
the electron-conducting phase in terms of conductivity and com- 
patibility with MC. However, its sintering problem needs to be ad- 
dressed  before  practical  demonstrations.  A  recent  noticeable  de- 
velopment towards low-cost, high-ﬂux and stable MECC is to use 
NiO as the solid matrix. The in-situ formed conductive Li 
1.6 O 
2 
phase  can  serve  as  the  electron-conducting  phase.  The  sintering 
and high-cost issues of Ag-based MECCs are subsequently solved.

2 TM-based CO 

In many cases, microstructure, surface modiﬁcation and operat- 
ing conditions are reviewed in detail with respect to permeation 
ﬂux and stability. All relevant materials (both MC and solid ma- 
trix), membrane thickness, operating temperature, feed and sweep 
gas  compositions,  and  CO 
2  ﬂux  and  stability  are  summarized  in 
Tables 3-5 for easy reference. Finally, designs and performances of 
2 capture and conversion reactors 
several types of CO 
4 as the sweep gas, the cap- 
are provided. As an example, with CH 
tured CO 
4 to produce syngas through 
2 can instantly react with CH 
DMR reaction. For MECC- and MEOCC-based membrane reactors, 
2 can reduce coking, an intrinsic problem for 
the co-transported O 
DMR  process.  The  CO 
2 TM  reactors  can  also  convert  ethane  into 
ethylene via oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) route us- 
ing the captured CO 
2  as a soft oxidizer. By combining with WGS 
process, MOCC membranes can promote the production of high- 
2 in single step without the need 
pressure H 
of any catalysts due to the high operating temperature. 
Finally, the proof-of-concept of electrochemical CO 

2 capture and 
conversion membranes has been successfully demonstrated at lab- 
oratory scale. A further demonstration of this new technology to 
bench-top, pilot and ultimately commercial levels and its competi- 
tiveness to the incumbent benchmark sorption-based technologies 
would require systematic advancements in materials, reactor de- 
sign and lifecycle analysis/system modeling in the near future.
