Mercury, as a global pollutant, has raised worldwide concern due to its high toxicity, long-distance trans-
port, persistence, and bioaccumulation in the environment. Coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) are consid-
ered as the major anthropogenic mercury emission source to the atmosphere, especially for China, India,
and the US. Studies on mercury in coal combustion process have been carried out for decades, which in-
clude content and occurrence forms of mercury in coal, mercury transformation during coal combustion,
sampling, co-removal and emission of mercury in CFPPs, mercury removal technologies for CFPPs. This
current review summarizes the knowledge and research developments concerning these mercury-related
issues, and hopes to provide a comprehensive understanding of mercury in coal combustion process and
guidance for future mercury research directions.

The average mercury content in the coal from China, the US, and South Africa is 0.20, 0.17, and
0.20 mg/kg, respectively, which is higher than the world’s coal average value of 0.1 mg/kg. In general,
mercury in coal is in the forms of sulfide-bound mercury (mainly pyritic mercury, dominant), clay-bound
mercury, and organic matter-bound mercury, which are influenced by diagenetic, coalification, and post-
diagenetic conditions, etc. Mercury transformation in coal combustion includes homogeneous (without
fly ash) and heterogeneous (with fly ash) reaction. The transformation is affected by the coal types, flue
gas components, flue gas temperature, combustion atmosphere, coal ash properties, etc. The effects of
chlorine, NOx, SO 2 , H 2 O, O 2 NH 3 on elemental mercury (Hg 0
) homogeneous oxidation and the influence
of physical structure properties, unburned carbon, and metal oxides in fly ash as well as flue gas compo-
nents on Hg 0
heterogeneous transformation are systematically reviewed in detail. For the mercury trans-
formation in oxy-coal combustion, O 2 promotes Hg 0
oxidation with Cl 2 while NO and CO 2 inhibit or do
oxidation in the atmosphere of NO and N 2 . SO 2 will limit Hg 0
not favor that reaction. CO 2 increases Hg 0
oxidation, while HCl has a higher oxidation effect on Hg 0
than that in air-coal combustion atmosphere.
Fly ash plays an important role in Hg 0
oxidation. SO 3 inhibits mercury retention by fly ash while H 2 O
promotes the oxidation.

The sampling or analysis principle, sampling requirements, and advantages and disadvantages of the
commonly used on-site mercury sampling methods, namely, Ontarion Hydro Method (OHM), US EPA
Method 30B, and Hg-CEMS, are compared. The air pollution control devices (APCDs) in CFPPs also have
the mercury co-removal ability besides the conventional pollutants, such as NO x , particulate matter (PM),
SO 2 , and fine PM. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment, electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or fab-
ric filter (FF), and wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) device are good at Hg 0
oxidation, particulate
mercury (Hg p
oxidation rate for
SCR equipment, and the total mercury (Hg t
) removal rate for ESP, FF, and WFGD

) capture, respectively. The Hg 0

device is 6.5–79.9%, 11.5–90.4%, 28.5–90%, and 3.9–72%, respectively. Wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP)
can capture Hg 0
, Hg 2 +
simultaneously. The mercury transformation process in SCR, ESP, FF,
WFGD, and WESP is also discussed. Hg t
removal in ESP + WFGD, SCR + ESP + WFGD, SCR + ESP + FF + WFGD,
and SCR + ESP + WFGD + WESP is 35.5–84%, 43.8–94.9%, 58.78–73.32%, and 56.59–89.07%, respectively. The
mercury emission concentration in the reviewed CFPPs of China, South Korea, Poland, the Netherlands,
and the US is 0.29–16.3 μg/m 3
. Mercury in some fly ash and gypsum, and in most WFGD and WESP
wastewater, is higher than the relevant limits, which needs to be paid attention to during their process-
ing.

Mercury removal technologies for CFPPs can be divided into pre-combustion (including coal wash-
ing technology and mild pyrolysis method), in-combustion (including low-NO x combustion technology,
circulating fluidized bed combustion technology, and halogens addition into coal), and post-combustion
(including existing commercial SCR catalyst improvement, inhibiting Hg 0
re-emission in WFGD, mercury
oxidizing catalysts, injecting oxidizing chemicals, carbon-based adsorbents, fly ash, calcium-based adsor-
bents, and mineral adsorbents) based on the mercury removal position. The mercury removal effects,
mercury removal mechanism, and/or influencing factors are summarized in detail. One of the regenera-
ble mercury removal adsorbents, the magnetic adsorbent modified by metal oxides or the metal halides,
is the most promising sorbent for mercury removal from CFPPs. It has advantages of high mercury re-
moval efficiency, low investment, easy separation from fly ash, and mercury recovery, etc. Lastly, further
works about mercury transformation in coal combustion atmosphere, mercury co-removal by APCDs, the
emission in CFPPs, and mercury removal technologies for CFPPs are noted.

1. Introduction

1.1. Mercury migration in the environment and its hazards

Mercury has caused widespread concern around the world due
to its great toxicity, which can damage human health and the en-
vironment [1,2] . The schematic diagram of the overall mercury cy-
cle in the atmosphere, modified from Travnikov [3] , is shown in
Fig. 1 . Mercury emitted from natural and anthropogenic sources, or
re-emitted from natural surfaces, includes gaseous elemental mer-
cury (Hg 0 ), gaseous oxidized mercury (Hg 2 + ), and particulate mer-
cury (Hg p ). The Hg 0 will undergo a series of chemical reactions in
both gaseous and aqueous phases to transform into Hg 2 + or Hg p .
Due to the high volatility of Hg 0 , it can stay in the atmosphere for
6–18 months. However, the residence time for the gaseous Hg 2 +

and  Hg p  in  the  atmosphere  is  estimated  in  hours  and  days  [4] .
Then,  Hg 2 +  and  Hg p  will  be  deposited  in  soil,  plants,  or  water,
which can combine with organic molecules to form methyl mer-
3 Hg + ). Thus, there are four common forms of mer-
cury (MeHg; CH
cury in the environment, namely, Hg 0 , Hg 2 + , Hg p , and MeHg.

The various forms of mercury determine its toxicity level. Mer-
cury  and  its  compounds  can  enter  human  body  via  the  diges-
tive  tract,  respiratory  tract,  and  skin  absorption.  In  general,  the
toxicity of mercury follows the decreasing order of organic mer-
cury > inorganic mercury > Hg 0 . Hg 0 can harm the human central
nervous system through the respiratory tract, while inorganic mer-
cury (such as water-soluble Hg 2 + ) will affect the kidneys via gas-
trointestinal absorption. Organic mercury (such as MeHg) can be
accumulated in fish and plants and then become enriched in hu-
man  bodies.  It  is  the  most  toxic,  as  it  can  damage  the  cerebral

cortex, cerebellum, and peripheral nerves [5,6] . The world-famous
Minamata Disease, which occurred in Japan in the 1950s, was be-
cause the residents ate the fish contaminated by MeHg. Mercury
emitted into atmosphere can be transported all over the globe de-
pending  upon  the  meteorological  conditions.  Thus,  mercury  is  a
global pollutant, which has the properties of long-distance trans-
port, high toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation in the envi-
ronment [7] .

1.2. Mercury emission sources

Mercury emission sources can be divided into two parts: natu-
ral and anthropogenic sources. The primary natural sources of mer-
cury  include  volcano  eruptions,  weathering  of  rocks,  forest  fires,
and  soil  erosion,  whereas  the  secondary  natural  release  occurs
from soils, sediments, bodies of water, landfills, etc. The anthro-
pogenic sources are fossil fuel combustion, metal production, ce-
ment production, etc. [2,8] . The contribution of mercury emissions
from natural sources is estimated at 45–66% of the total mercury
emissions [4] . In 2005, the global anthropogenic mercury emission
amount was estimated to be 1930 tonnes [9] . For the same year,
the proportion of global anthropogenic emissions of mercury to air
from  various  sections  is  shown  in  Fig.  2  [10] .  It  shows  that  the
fossil fuel (primarily coal) combustion for power and heating was
the largest single anthropogenic mercury emission source, occupy-
ing 45% of the total anthropogenic emission amount [11] . The ten
largest mercury emitting countries based on their emissions to air
in  2005  from  various  anthropogenic  sectors  are  shown  in  Fig.  3
[10] , the top three anthropogenic mercury emitting countries are
China, India, and the US. In addition, the fossil fuel combustion for
power and heating, mainly coal-fired power plants (CFPPs), are the
major anthropogenic source of mercury emissions [11] .

1.3. Mercury emission regulation and the international initiatives

To solve the problem of mercury pollution, many countries have
taken  relevant  measures  and  formulated  relevant  regulations.  In

the ten largest emitting countries [10] .

the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments of the US, mercury and its
compounds  were  classified  as  hazardous  air  pollutants.  In  2005,
the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) issued the Clean
Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), which restricted the mercury emission
amount from new CFPPs [12] . In 2008, the US Court of Appeals
ruled to abolish CAMR and required the US EPA to develop more
stringent mercury emission regulations. In December 2011, the US
EPA’s  Mercury  and  Air  Toxics  Standards  (MATS)  ruled  the  final
standards for limiting mercury emissions from CFPPs [13] . In Jan-
uary 2005, the European Commission also adopted a strategy to
reduce mercury emission levels in the environment [14] .

The Ministry of Environmental Protection in China initiated a
pilot mercury emission control project based on 16 CFPPs in 2010
[7] . The concentration limit (30 μg/m 3 ) for mercury and its com-
pounds  emitted  from  CFPPs  of  China  was  firstly  given  in  2011,
which  has  been  executed  since  January  1,  2015  [15] .  In  October
2013, more than 120 countries signed the Minamata Convention,
which focused on anthropogenic mercury emissions and aimed to
reduce global mercury pollution in the coming decades [2,4] . In or-
der to meet the Minamata Convention, mercury emission concen-
tration from CFPPs should be restricted under a value of 5 μg/m 3
and 3 μg/m 3 in 2020 and 2030, respectively, recommended by An-
cora et al. [16] . The mercury emission concentrations limits for the
new and existing CFPPs in China and the US are shown in Table 1
[7] . The emission standard of China is far higher than that of the
US,  which  means  China  should  take  strong  measures  to  signifi-
cantly decrease the mercury emissions from CFPPs.

From the issues raised above, it is clear that mercury is a global
pollutant that has been prioritized worldwide and there is an ur-
gent need to act on controlling mercury emission into the envi-
ronment. Among the various anthropogenic sources, CFPPs are the
major source of mercury emissions into the atmosphere. Thus, this

2. Coal consumption and utilization across the world

2.1. Coal consumption

The global primary energy consumption from 1992 to 2017 and
the  shares  of  global  primary  energy  consumption  from  1965  to
2017 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively, according to the BP
Statistical Review of World Energy (2018) [17] . It can be seen that
the  coal  consumption  amount  shows  an  increasing  trend,  which
has risen from about 2191 to 3731 Mt oil equivalent since 1992.
Although the share of coal in the global primary energy consump-
tion has been fluctuating since 1965, coal has always been the ma-
jor primary energy source with its share at nearly 30%, second only
to the share of oil.

Based  on  the  reported  regional  consumption  of  fuel  in  2017
[17] ,  the  top  four  regions  of  coal  consumption  are  Asia  Pacific,
Africa, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Europe in

decreasing order. China is the largest coal consumer in the world,
which  accounts  for  50.7%  of  the  total  coal  consumption  amount
in  2016.  The  following  top  ten  countries  behind  China  are  In-
dia (11.0%), the US (8.9%), Japan (3.2%), Russian Federation (2.5%),
South Korea (2.2%), South Africa (2.2%), Germany (1.9%), Indone-
sia (1.5%), and Poland (1.3%). In addition, coal makes a significant
contribution to each country’s own primary energy consumption
in  some  cases,  such  as  for  China  (60.43%),  India  (56.26%),  Japan
(26.40%), and the US (14.86%). For China, the total coal consump-
tion kept growing in the period of the 13th Five-year Plan (2016–
2020)  [18] .  Thus,  the  trend  of  coal  as  a  primary  energy  source
around the world, especially for China, will not change in the com-
ing decades [19] .

2.2. Coal utilization

Coal  can  be  used  in  many  industries,  including  the  steel,  ce-
ment,  building,  coal  power,  coke,  coal  chemistry,  and  paper  and
textile  industries,  etc.  [18,20] .  Most  of  these  industries  need  the
heat  from  coal  combustion.  Based  on  the  International  Energy
Agency (IEA) statistics, the world’s consumption of coal used for
power production accounted for 62.7% of total coal production in
2011, which had an average annual increase of 0.4% from 1990 to
2011. In the case of China, about 50% of coal production is con-
sumed to generate electricity. However, the ratio of coal consump-
tion for power production in most developed countries is signif-
icantly higher and mostly above 80%, such as 91% in the US and
76.2% in the EU in 2011 [21] . In 2015, 65.5% of the coal consump-
tion  in  the  world  was  used  in  electricity  and  commercial  heat,
while  82.7%  of  the  consumption  took  place  for  this  purpose  in
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
member countries [22] . In China, power production will be a key
industry  for  coal  utilization,  although  the  government  has  made
effort s to further enhance the constraints on the coal consumption
cap to comply with the requirements of its pollution control policy
in the long term (2020–2050) [23] .

Mercury  in  coal  is  known  to  be  of  concern  to  public  health
[11,23] and the environment. Facing the huge amount of coal con-
sumption every year worldwide, knowing the content and occur-
rence forms of mercury in coal is very important and necessary for
obtaining the mercury emission assessment and optimum mercury
removal technology during coal utilization, especially coal combus-
tion for power generation [24–27] .

3. Mercury content and forms in coal

3.1. Determination methods for mercury content in coal

The major standard mercury determination methods in coal in-
clude ASTM D6414-14: Acid extraction or wet oxidation/cold va-
por  atomic  absorption  [28] ,  ASTM  D6722-01:  Direct  combustion
analysis [29] , EPA Methods 7471B: Mercury in solid or semisolid
waste (manual cold-vapor technique) [30] , and ISO 15237: 2016:
Solid mineral fuels -Determination of total mercury content of coal
[31] . The main difference between these methods is the pretreat-
ment techniques of coal samples, which are chemical digestion and
thermal  decomposition.  Cold  vapor  atomic  absorption  spectrom-
etry and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy are usually
used for the detection of mercury after pretreatment. With a long
history and high recognition, the analytical method with chemi-
cal digestion has been widely adopted. However, the pretreatment
process involves many steps and requires mercury to be dissolved
in solution, which leads to an increased chance of sample contam-
ination in the digestion process [25] . In addition, the experimen-
tal personnel need to be well trained. Due to the advantages of
quickness, convenience, and high efficiency, the thermal decompo-
sition analytical method has become more favorable. The commer-
cial mercury analysis instruments include Hydra AA Hg Analyzer
(Teledyne Leeman Labs), DMA-80 Direct Hg Analyzer (Milestone),
the AMA 254 Hg Analyzer (Leco), the Hydra-C Hg Analyzer (Tele-
dyne Leeman Labs), and the RA-915M Hg Analyzer equipped with
the pyrolyzer PYRO-915, etc.

3.2. Mercury content in coal

Many researchers have determined the mercury content in coal
around  the  world  [32–43] .  Due  to  the  combined  effects  of  var-
ious  geological  factors  in  the  depositional  environment,  mercury
content in coal varies greatly in different regions, different coal-
forming periods, and different degrees of deterioration. For China,
Zhang et al. [32] measured 990 coal samples, finding that the av-
erage mercury content in the studied Chinese coal was 0.16 mg/kg
with a range of 0.003–10.5 mg/kg. Ren et al. [33] , Tang and Huang
[34] , Zheng et al. [35] , and Yang et al. [36] also reported the aver-
age concentration of mercury in Chinese coal with values of 0.20,
0.1,  0.19,  and  0.20 mg/kg  based  on  the  sample  numbers  of  1413,
1458, 1699, and 1793, respectively. Mukherjee et al. [37] collected
the information on mercury concentration in coal from India and

Russia, presenting the range of 0.11–0.80 and 0.02–0.9 mg/kg, re-
spectively. Finkelman [38] reported the average mercury value of
0.17 mg/kg in the US coal with changing scope of 0–10.0 mg/kg ac-
cording to 7649 coal samples. The mean mercury concentration in
the coal of South Africa, Indonesia, Poland, and Australia is 0.20,
0.10,  0.05,  and  0.06 mg/kg,  respectively  [39–42] .  Compared  with
the mean value of 0.1 mg/kg in the world’s coal given by Yudovich
and Ketris [43] , it can found that mercury content in the coal of
China, the US, and South Africa is higher, which needs to be given
more attention. The content of mercury in coal around the world
is summarized in Table 2 .

3.3. Mercury forms in coal

In general, the occurrence forms of mercury in coal can be de-

termined by using the following methods [37,44–46] :

(1) Correlational analysis method is used to explore the occur-
rence forms of mercury in coal based on the content corre-
lation of mercury with ash or sulfur (including total sulfur,
organic sulfur, pyrite sulfur, sulfate sulfur) in coal.

(2) The  float-sink  test  uses  several  organic  solvents  to  divide
the coal into sub-coal samples with different densities [47] .
Then,  the  correlation  between  the  main  component  and
mercury content in the sub-coal samples is studied [48] .
(3) Sequential chemical extraction procedure (SCEP) adopts spe-
cific chemical solvents to extract the different mercury forms
in coal samples step by step based on their different solubil-
ity. In general, the chemical forms of mercury in coal can be
divided into six chemical species, namely, water-leachable,
ion-exchangeable, organic-bound, carbonate-bound, silicate-
bound, and sulfide-bound [49,50] .

(4) Thermal treatment method is used to obtain the occurrence
mode  of  mercury  based  on  the  specified  release  temper-
atures  of  the  specified  mercury  compounds,  as  shown  in
Table 3 [47,51–55] .

(5) Direct  test  analysis  technology  uses  advanced  equipment
(such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to determine the speciation
and binding of mercury on coal directly. However, it is very
difficult  to  implement  due  to  the  low  mercury  concentra-
tion in the actual application. The silicon in the coal inter-
feres with the XPS detection results [56] . Thus, this method
is  generally  applied  for  the  mercury  sorbents,  which  have
high mercury content [57–59] .

In some cases, two or three of these methods are combined to

discover the forms of mercury in coal.

3.3.1. Correlational analysis method

Liu et al. [60] conducted a correlation analysis between mer-
cury concentration and the content of ash and total sulfur in the
coal, which found that mercury in the coal of Indonesia and Rus-
sia was mainly in the sulfide-bound form while that in Australian
coal was mainly bound to aluminosilicate. Feng et al. [61] found
that mercury in the 32 coal samples had a relationship with to-
tal sulfur and Fe. With the strong correlation between total sul-
fur and Fe as well as a large amount of pyrite observed by micro-
scope, it might be inferred that mercury mainly exists in pyrite.
Kostova [62] confirmed that mercury had strong connection with
organic matter, especially the organic sulphur compounds for the
lignite from the Karlovo basin, while the organic-bound mercury
and partially silicate-bound mercury were the main mercury forms
based on the high positive correlation of mercury with ash yield
and organic sulphur for the Beli Breg lignite. However, Ohki et al.
[63] found that mercury content in coal had no correlation with
sulfur (or pyrite sulfur) content but had a certain correlation with
ash  content  for  the  bituminous  coals  used  for  Japanese  power
plants and industries. Dziok et al. [64] used the correlation analysis
to explore the mercury form in Polish hard coals, which found that
mercury in the studied coals was both in the organic and inorganic
matter. For the organic matter, there was a significant correlation
between mercury and the total sulfur and organic sulfur. For the
inorganic matter, an obvious correlation could be found between
mercury and pyritic sulfur.

3.3.2. Float-sink test and sequential chemical extraction procedure

Wagner  and  Tlotleng  [48]  found  that  mercury  was  in  both
the  float  and  sink  fractions  during  the  float-sink  test,  indicat-
ing the existence of organic- and inorganic-bound mercury in the
coals.  Finkelman  [65]  concluded  that  mercury  mainly  existed  in
inorganic minerals, such as sulfide (sphalerite) or selenide in the
coals by studying the occurrence of trace elements in Illinois (US)
coals through the float-sink test. Pan et al. [66] adopted the SCEP
to  study  the  mercury  occurrence  mode  in  the  coals  from  four
different  coal  preparation  plants  in  China,  and  found  that  mer-
cury was mainly distributed in sulfide (mainly pyrite). Riley et al.
[67] adopted the SCEP to explore the occurrence mode of mercury
in six Australian coals, finding that mercury was predominantly as-
sociated with pyrite, while it might also be in some other forms,
such as organically bound and elemental mercury, sulphides, and

selenide-bound mercury. Zheng et al. [50] adopted the SCEP to in-
vestigate the mercury occurrence mode in Permian Huaibei coal
from  China.  Based  on  the  34  coal  samples,  they  reported  that
sulfide-bound mercury, organic-bound mercury, and silicate-bound
mercury were the main species. Bool and Helble [68] and Palmer
et al. [69] also presented that organic-bound mercury and sulfide-
bound mercury were the main mercury forms in the coal based
on the SCEP for the mercury form analysis of the Pittsburgh No.8
coal and the Antelope mine in the Powder River basin, Wyoming,
respectively.

3.3.3. Thermal treatment method and methods combined

Mashyanov  et  al.  [24]  used  a  gradual  heating  method  to  de-
termine  the  thermal  characteristics  of  mercury  in  coal  of  differ-
ent types from deposits in Russia, Ukraine, and South Africa, re-
vealing  the  existence  of  various  mercury  thermospecies,  includ-
ing in part the absorbed elemental mercury and mercury bound
to  pyrites.  Zheng  et  al.  [49]  concluded  that  sulfide-bound  mer-
cury  and  organic-bound  mercury  were  the  main  mercury  forms
in low-sulfur coals (sulfur content < 1.0%), by adopting the corre-
lational analysis method and sequential extraction procedure, and
they  concluded  that  the  correlation  between  mercury  and  dif-
ferent  forms  of  sulfur  in  the  study  was  in  the  order  of  pyrite
sulfur > total  sulfur > organic  sulfur > sulfate  sulfur.  Guo  et  al.
[70] used temperature-programmed decomposition (TPD) coupled
with  online  atomic  fluorescence  spectroscopy  and  acid  leaching
to  study  the  characterization  of  mercury  in  six  Chinese  coals
with  different  ranks.  They  found  that  mercury  in  the  coals  had
organic-bound mercury (16 −36%) releasing at 220 −600 °C, silicate-
bound mercury (10 −26%) releasing at > 600 °C, pyrite-bound mer-
cury  (5 −44%)  releasing  at  250 −630 °C,  and  HCl-soluble  mercury
(10 −34%) releasing at 150 −600 °C. Lusilao-Makiese et al. [39] com-
bined the SCEP and correlation analysis to investigate the mercury
occurrence forms in South African coals, concluding that a large
portion of the mercury in the studied coals was associated with
organic constituents and pyrite. Feng and Hong [71] used the SCEP
and  density  separation  method  to  study  the  mercury  species  in
coals from Guizhou, China, concluding that mercury in the coals
mainly existed in pyrite. Strezov et al. [72] investigated the form of
mercury in three coals by using the SCEP, physical separation, and
thermal treatment methods, which confirmed a strong relationship
between mercury and the pyritic sulfur in coal.

In  summary,  there  are  three  main  mercury  forms  in  coal,  in
which  sulfide-bound  mercury  (mainly  pyritic  mercury)  is  domi-
nant, followed by clay-bound mercury and organic matter-bound
mercury. The occurrence mode of mercury in coal has a strong cor-
relation with sulfur content in coal for most coals, in which pyritic
mercury is the typically dominant species; organic-bound mercury
and sulfide-bound mercury (mainly pyritic mercury) are the main
forms in low-sulfur coals. However, many factors, namely, diage-
netic, coalification, and post-diagenetic conditions, including phe-
nomena such as mineralization that post-dates coal formation and
magmatic intrusion, etc., can affect the occurrence form of mer-
cury in coal [64] , which results in the large changes in ratio range
of various mercury forms. Thus, the general results and the meth-
ods above can provide a suitable way to explore the mercury oc-
currence forms for each specific coal, based on their different pur-
poses, such as mercury removal by coal washing or mild pyrolysis,
or release in coal combustion or gasification, etc.

4.1. General transformation

In coal combustion process, coal particles firstly begin pyroly-
sis and ignition. With the volatile releasing, the char starts to burn

and break into smaller particles [73] . At the high combustion flame
temperature, almost all the mercury in coal decomposes into Hg 0
based on the mercury forms, mentioned above, in coal [74,75] . As
the flue gas cools, Hg 0 can react with flue gas components, such as
halogens (Cl
2 , etc. to trans-
form into Hg 2 +  through homogeneous reactions [75–77] . Part of
the Hg 0  will be catalytically oxidized to Hg 2 + or absorbed on fly
ash acting as Hg p through heterogeneous oxidation with the help
of fly ash and flue gas components [74,78–80] . In addition, some
Hg 2 +  can  also  be  absorbed  on  the  fly  ash  surface  as  Hg p  while
some  Hg 0  keeps  its  form  without  transformation  in  the  cooling
process. Finally, the mercury emitted into the atmosphere can ex-
ist in three forms: Hg 0 , Hg 2 + , and Hg p  [81,82] . The general mer-
cury transformation process, modified after [83] , is shown in Fig. 6 .
For CFPP, Hg 2 +  is easily removed by wet flue gas desulfurization
(WFGD) devices because of its high water solubility. The Hg p can
be captured with the use of particulate matter (PM) control de-
vices, such as an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or fabric filter (FF).
Due to its high volatility and water insolubility, it is very difficult
for APCDs in power plants to capture Hg 0  [74–86] . Thus, under-
standing the transformation mechanism of mercury in coal com-
bustion is very important for the selection or development of its
removal method. Many factors can influence mercury transforma-
tion, such as coal types, flue gas components, flue gas temperature,
combustion atmosphere, coal ash properties, etc. Based on partici-
pation of fly ash or not, the mercury reaction can be divided into
homogeneous (without fly ash) and heterogeneous (with fly ash)
reaction, which are discussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 .

4.2. Homogeneous reaction

4.2.1. Effect of chlorine

Chlorine  is  considered  as  the  key  element  for  Hg 0  oxidation
[87–89] . During coal combustion, chlorine in coal will be released
in the main form of atomic Cl, which transforms into HCl or Cl
2
with flue gas cooling. The relevant transformation process can be
described by the reactions (1) –(4) [90,91] . Ghorishi [92] examined
the effects of HCl concentration and temperature on Hg 0 oxidation
at the gas mixture of 40 μg/m 3 Hg 0 , 5% CO
2 , and the balance
2 , finding that the increasing concentration of HCl resulted in an
N
increase in Hg 0 oxidation. The Hg 0 oxidation rate ranged from 9.1%

2 , 2% O

to  27.2%,  corresponding  to  the  50  to  200  ppmv  of  HCl.  Agarwal
et al. [93] summarized that HCl oxidized Hg 0  more effectively at
temperatures higher than 600 °C, while Cl
2 led to a stronger mer-
cury  oxidation  effect  at  temperatures  below  500 °C.  It  has  been
shown that the Hg 0 reaction with HCl was favorable at higher tem-
peratures [94,95] while it reacted favorably with Cl
2 at lower tem-
peratures [96–98] . Laudal et al. [97] performed bench-scale exper-
iments to investigate the effects of various flue gas components on
Hg 0 oxidation using the Ontario Hydro Method (OHM) and found
2 could realize 84.8% Hg 0 oxidation at 175 °C with
that 10-ppmv Cl
flue  gas  components  of  N
2 O.  The  experiments
2 ,  and  H
2 ,  CO
of  Agarwal  et  al.  [99]  demonstrated  that  Hg 0  oxidation  reached
2  concentration exceeded 50 ppmv. Based on the
above 95% as Cl
electronic structure, Cl
2 is much stronger than HCl as an oxidizing
agent.

Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations show that all the mer-
cury  in  the  flue  gas  exists  as  Hg 0  at  temperatures  above  627 °C
while  it  will  be  in  the  form  of  HgCl
2  entirely  at  temperatures
below  452 °C  for  typical  coals  [100] .  However,  the  measurement
of  mercury  in  the  flue  gas  with  a  temperature  of  about  127 °C
in the full-scale combustion system does not support the equilib-
rium calculations results, the reported data of which is 30 −95% of
Hg 2 +  [89] . The experimental data of Fry et al. [101] showed that
quench rate had obvious effects on homogeneous mercury oxida-
tion, in which a change from −210 to −440 K/s led to the mer-
cury oxidation from 34% to 86% at 300 ppmv chlorine. It indicates
mercury oxidation with flue gas is kinetically controlled. Many re-
searchers have developed the reaction kinetic mechanisms to ex-
plore  the  Hg 0  oxidation  process  in  the  presence  of  Cl
2  or  HCl.
Widmer and West [102] firstly gave the rate constants in the Hg 0
oxidation mechanism with chlorine, which was the eight reaction
paths. Due to few experiments about the rate constants, assump-
tions and analogies were used by Widmer and West [102] that re-
sulted in the inaccurate kinetic parameters. Then, theoretical rate

constants for some of the eight Hg-Cl reactions were determined
by quantum chemistry and transition state theory (TST), such as
in the works of Sliger et al. [94] , Li et al. [103] , Wilcox et al. [104–
108] , Khalizov et al. [109] , Krishnakumar and Helble [110] , Liu et al.
[111] , and Zheng et al. [112] , which helped to improve the accuracy
of the reaction kinetic parameters, shown in Table 4 . Wilcox et al.
[113] summarized that the radical combination reactions concern-
ing HgCl and Cl intermediate species could be the main pathways
with the existence of chlorine radical chemistry based on theoret-
2 and HOCl seemed to play a ma-
ical calculations. In addition, Cl
jor role in mercury oxidation over HCl, while atomic Cl might be
in the dominant oxidation pathway, indicated by both the kinetic
and thermodynamic predications [104] . Krishnakumar and Helble
[110] adopted high-level quantum chemistry calculations to get the
TST rate constants for the eight-step homogeneous Hg-Cl reactions.
It  was  found  that  the  rate  constants  of  Hg/HgCl  reactions  with
HOCl were faster or comparable to those with Cl
2 , while reactions
between Hg/HgCl and HCl were the lowest. The conversion of Hg +
to Hg 2 + was faster than that of Hg 0 to Hg + , which indicated that
HgCl was a reactive intermediate. Hou et al. [114] used the chem-
ical dynamics software Chemkin to investigate the level of effect
of each reaction on Hg 0 oxidation, finding that R1, R7, and R5 had
great impact. It can be inferred that Cl, HOCl, and HCl are the im-
portant Cl species for Hg 0 oxidation. The gaseous mercury oxida-
tion behavior in homogeneous reaction with Cl compounds done
by Naruse et al. [115] showed that Hg 0 firstly reacted with Cl rad-
icals  to  produce  HgCl.  Then,  the  HgCl  reacted  with  Cl
2  to  form
2 . The Cl radical played a significant role in the relevant re-
HgCl
2 was more
action chains. Qiao and Xu [116] also concluded that Cl
effective than HCl for Hg 0  oxidation in the Hg/O/H/Cl system. In
addition, the reaction between Hg and Cl is faster than that be-
2 [117] . Thus, it can be summarized that the
tween Hg/HgCl and Cl
degree of effect of Cl forms on Hg 0 oxidation is the Cl radical, Cl
2 ,
and HCl in decreasing order.

2 above that temperature for typical O

Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations show that Cl

2  domi-
nates HCl at temperatures below 475 °C while HCl dominates over
Cl
2 O concentrations
[99] .  The  Cl  is  predicted  to  be  HCl  at  flame  temperatures  while
2 at the temperature of APCDs inlet by
half of it is thought to be Cl
equilibrium calculations. However, the kinetic calculations indicate
that less than 1% of the Cl is converted to Cl
2 at that temperature
[89] . The field test on halides emission at a 200 MW pulverized
coal combustion boiler showed that HCl was the main Cl form in
flue gas while Cl

2 concentration was extremely low [118] .

Based on the studies above, it can be summarized that Hg 0 ox-
idation by Cl is affected by the flue gas temperature, Cl forms, and
their concentration, etc., which is summarized in Fig. 7 .

to a mercury oxidation rate of 11% at 340 °C [119] , which indicated

2  at a flue gas temperature of 150 °C, shown in

the ratio of Hg 2 + increased up to 14%. This might be NO reacting

In addition, the effect of NO on Hg 0 oxidation by chlorine has
also been investigated by some researchers. Work done by Laudal
et al. [97] showed that the addition of NO could result in a de-
crease in the presence of oxidized mercury in the gas mixture of
2 , which might be due to a reaction between
N
2 , CO
2 , which was
NO and Cl
thermodynamically  favorable  at  temperatures  near  the  end  of  a
typical  power  plant.  Niksa  et  al.  [121]  predicted  that  lower  NO
concentration  ( < 20  ppmv)  benefited  Hg 0  oxidation  while  higher
NO concentration inhibited the Hg 0 conversion in the presence of
HCl.  Auzmendi-Murua  and  Bozzelli  [122]  indicated  that  NO  sig-
nificantly decreased mercury oxidation with the addition of chlo-
rine (Cl = 500 ppmv). Preciado et al. [123] studied the effects of
halogens on mercury oxidation under air- and oxygen-fired condi-
tions in a bench-scale, methane-fired, 300 W, quartz-lined reactor,
which found that the addition of NO ( < 300 ppmv) had little or
no effect on mercury oxidation by chlorine. Another explanation
for the influence of NO on mercury oxidation with the presence of
chlorine is that NO can react with OH, which takes away OH that
would react with H. Thus, more free H can react with Cl to produce
HCl, which results in little available chlorine reacting with mercury
[122] . The relevant reactions are shown in reactions (11) –(13) .

on mercury oxidation by HCl depends on the concentration of SO
2
and HCl. Studies in full-scale utilities indicate that SO
2 had a pos-
itive correlation with Hg 0  oxidation, and the interactions are af-
fected by the operating conditions, chlorine content in coal, and
temperature [126] .

acted with Cl to form OH and HCl (reaction (16) ), which removed
Cl from HCl, and slowed the mercury conversion by chlorine. Niksa

Hall et al. [128] investigated the Hg 0  homogeneous oxidation
2  in the temperature range of 20–700 °C, in which no mer-
by O
cury oxidation was observed. However, Niksa et al. [121] argued
that O
2 could weakly promote homogeneous Hg oxidation by the
kinetic model. Xu et al. [129,130] adopted detailed chemical kinet-
ics to study homogeneous mercury oxidation and also found that
2  benefited Hg 0  oxidation, especially at the low Cl
2  concentra-
O
tion; 1.5 −6.0% of mercury was predicted to be present as HgO in
all cases. Based on the studies mentioned above, it can be inferred
2 may promote Hg 0 oxidation, but the enhancement effect is
that O
slight.

4.2.6. Effect of NH 3

In addition to the conventional flue gas components described
above, NH
3  is also a non-negligible flue gas component after se-
lective catalytic reduction (SCR) device in coal-fired power plants.
In the findings of Hall et al. [119] , it is found that there is no re-
action between Hg 0 and NH
3 for the reaction temperature ranges
3 on Hg 0
of 20–600 °C. However, the works about influence of NH
homogeneous reaction with other flue gas components are little
reported, which need more studies.

4.3. Heterogeneous reaction

Though some homogenous mercury oxidation mechanisms have
been proposed to predict mercury oxidation in simulated flue gas,
these mechanisms are unable to accurately predict mercury oxida-
tion in actual coal-fired flue gas [79] . One reason is that the kinetic
parameters of the homogeneous reaction are not accurate enough
and incomplete. Another reason is the existence of heterogeneous
reaction between fly ash and Hg 0 in the presence of flue gas com-
ponents, which also plays an important role in mercury oxidation
or adsorption. Many factors can affect the heterogeneous reaction
of fly ash on Hg 0 , which include physical structure properties (sur-
face area, particle sizes, etc.) of fly ash, unburned carbon, metal
oxides (Fe
3 , etc.) in fly ash, and flue gas components, as

elaborated below.

4.3.1. Physical structure properties of fly ash

Zhou  et  al.  [131]  conducted  mercury  adsorption  by  coal-fired
fly ash with particle sizes of 25–50 μm, 50–74 μm, and 74–100 μm

36

was little correlation between the fly ash particle size and the mer-
cury captured, which indicated that particle size was not the main
factor for mercury capture. Hower et al. [140] reviewed the mer-
cury capture by native fly ash carbons in CFPPs and concluded that
mercury  capture  by  fly  ash  is  more  related  to  unburned  carbon
amount and surface chemistry.

It can be further generalized that the fly ash with larger parti-
cle sizes or surface area generally benefited mercury adsorption. In
fact, the changes of particle size and surface area are a reflection of
the content and type of unburned carbon in fly ash to some extent
[135,138] , which have great influence on mercury oxidation and/or
adsorption.

4.3.2. Unburned carbon in fly ash

In general, the UBC in coal fly ash is in the range of 2 −12%.
With  the  installation  of  low-NOx  burners,  which  require  low-
oxygen  and/or  low-temperature  combustion  conditions,  the  UBC
can reach up to 20% in some cases [141] . The close relationship
of  UBC  in  fly  ash  with  mercury  capture  has  been  reported;  the
capture  increases  with  the  increase  in  UBC  content  in  fly  ash
[140,142–144] .  Wilcox  et  al.  [113]  reported  that  UBC  correlated
with coal rank, in which low-rank coal-(such as lignite) derived fly
ash had the highest mercury capture efficiency compared to that
from high-rank coals (such as anthracite and bituminous). Hower
et al. [140,144,145] summarized that mercury capture by coal com-
bustion  fly  ash  is  also  affected  by  the  accessibility  and  type  of
fly ash carbon. Kostova et al. [137] indicated that fly ash carbon
from subbituminous coal was more efficient in capturing mercury
than ashes with much higher carbon from bituminous coal. Zhao
et  al.  [146]  argued  that  UBC  was  not  the  only  factor  that  con-
trolled mercury captured by fly ash, and there were obvious dif-
ferences in mercury retention capacities for various carbon forms.
The  anisotropic  carbon  particles  with  porous  network  structure
had a good mercury capture effect. Based on the study of influence
of fly ash carbon type on mercury adsorption, Lopez-Anton et al.
[147] showed that the capture of different mercury species by fly
ashes was dependent on their nature and the type of anisotropic
particles. In addition, the oxygen functional groups formed on the
carbon surface are indicated to be responsible for mercury reten-
tion [148,149] while other researchers conclude there is no obvi-
ous relationship between them [150] . Jew et al. [151] found that
mercury was bound to the carboxylic acid functional groups in the
fly ash. By investigating the chemical forms of the fluorine, chlo-
rine, oxygen, and carbon in coal fly ash and their correlations with
mercury retention, Deng et al. [152] revealed that carbon-oxygen
complexes, such as C = O, OH/C –O, and (O –C = O)–O, on the surface
were significant for mercury capture on fly ash.

Mercury adsorption on unburned carbon can be explained by
the  physical  and  chemical  reactions  between  the  carbon  surface
and mercury. The unburned carbon surface may contain some ad-
sorption centers, called major active sites, which can adsorb some
molecules to act as a secondary canter for the adsorption of more
molecules [141] . The existence of halogens, such as Cl or Br, can
promote  mercury  oxidation/adsorption  on  the  unburned  carbon
surface. The heterogeneous Hg/Cl mechanism on unburned carbon
is proposed as reactions (17) –(24) [153] .
StSA ( s ) + HCl → StCl ( s ) + H

StCl ( s ) + Cl → C l 2 + StSA ( s )

best mercury adsorption performance. Though the smaller fly ash
had  a  larger  specific  surface  area,  it  would  be  with  a  low  sur-
face  area  utilization  rate  for  mercury  adsorption  because  of  low
unburned  carbon  content  (UBC)  [132,133] .  He  et  al.  [134]  inves-
tigated  mercury  retention  by  fly  ash  with  five  size  fractions  of

had the highest mercury retention capacity, which might be due
to  its  high  UBC.  Wu  et  al.  [135]  indicated  that  fly  ash  with  a
particle size larger than 100 μm had the highest mercury adsorp-
tion efficiency of 67.83%, while fly ash with a particle size smaller
than 25 μm possessed the lowest mercury adsorption efficiency of
13.67%. Bhardwaj et al. [136] conducted mercury uptake tests by
four fly ashes from different CFPPs and found that both the sur-
face area and particle size had positive effects on mercury oxida-
tion and adsorption. Kostova et al. [137] suggested that the cap-
tured mercury increased as the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) sur-
face area and micropore surface area increased based on the rela-
tion of mercury content with BET and the micropore surface area
of fly ashes from the Republika power plant in Bulgaria. Suarez-
Ruiz and Parra [138] gave the relationship between the BET sur-
face area and mercury concentration of the fly ashes, and mercury
concentration in the sized fractions from four fly ashes, as shown
in Figs. 8 and 9 , respectively. It was revealed that there was a poor
relationship between the surface areas and mercury retention for
these fly ashes, while the finest particle size fraction had the low-
est mercury concentration. Gao et al. [139] concluded that there

addition, the mercury oxidation activity and capacity of α-Fe

and γ -Fe

to  the  formation  of  Fe-OH  groups.  Li  et  al.  [161]  conducted  ex-
periments to see the influence of magnetic grains separated from
fly ash, α-Fe
3 on mercury distribution in flue gas.
They found that magnetic grains in fly ash could oxidize the mer-
cury, and the influence of γ -Fe
3  on mercury distribution was
2 O
higher than α-Fe
3 . Yang et al. [162] performed the Hg 0 removal
capacities of magnetospheres from fly ash at a temperature range
of 10 0–40 0 °C, which revealed that the optimal Hg 0 removal capac-
ity for magnetospheres was 250 °C with the main Hg 0 adsorption
process occurring at a low reaction temperature (100 and 150 °C)
and the dominant Hg 0 oxidation process happening at a high tem-
perature (20 0–40 0 °C). Based on these findings, it can be concluded
that iron oxides in fly ash can promote the oxidation and adsorp-
tion of Hg 0 , which is affected by iron oxides types and reaction
temperature.

The  Hg 0  heterogeneous  reaction  mechanism  on  the  Fe
2 O
3
surface  in  the  presence  of  HCl  has  been  investigated  by  some
researchers.  Yang  et  al.  [153]  developed  a  detailed  chemical
model containing the Hg 0 homogeneous and heterogeneous mech-
anism  to  predict  mercury  oxidation  in  coal-fired  flue  gas,  in
which  the  Hg 0  heterogeneous  model  included  the  catalytic  ef-
3 within fly ash. The sensitivity analysis showed that
fects of Fe
2 O
Hg 0 → FeHgCl(s) → HgCl
2 was the main channel of mercury hetero-
geneous  oxidation  by  HCl  on  the  Fe
3  surface.  Moreover,  Yang
et al. [163] used the experimental method to confirm that Hg 0 het-
3  surface occurred by
erogeneous oxidation by HCl over the Fe
the gas-solid reaction between gaseous Hg 0  and active adsorbed
Cl species produced from HCl dissociation. The mercury oxidation
over Fe
3  in the presence of HCl was described by Yang et al.
[163] through the eight-step heterogeneous reaction kinetic model,
shown in reactions (25) –(32) . Jung et al. [164] used density func-
tional theory (DFT) to theoretically investigate the interaction be-
tween mercury and α-Fe
3 , results of which showed Cl played a
vital role in mercury adsorption onto α-Fe
3 . It was consistent
with experimental results, finding the relationship of Hg-Fe-Cl ex-
isted in fly ash. Liu et al. [57] adopted the DFT and experimen-
tal methods to study the Hg 0  adsorption mechanism on α-Fe
2 O
3
(001) surface in the existence of HCl, which found that the reac-
tion followed the Eley −Rideal mechanism with HCl pre-adsorption,
showing good agreement with that of Yang et al. [163] . Further-
more, Liu et al. [165] also used the bench-scale fixed bed reactor
to  investigate  Hg 0  oxidation  over α-Fe
3  samples
in the presence of HCl, which considered the wide reaction tem-
perature range of 80–680 °C. It was reported that the Hg 0 removal
3 could be divided into three stages
mechanism with HCl and Fe
based  on  the  reaction  temperature.  At  low  temperatures  (80–
280 °C), the most probable Hg 0 oxidation path was the Eley-Rideal
mechanism with HCl pre-adsorption, shown in Fig. 11 (a). For tem-
peratures of  280–580 °C,  Hg 0  removal efficiency  by α-Fe
3  and
γ -Fe
3  was  different  with  the  suitable  Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism, which was the reaction of adsorbed HCl and Hg 0 on
the  Fe
2 (s,  g),  shown
in  Fig.  11 (b).  For  temperatures  higher  than  680 °C,  both  the  ho-
mogenous reaction of Hg 0 and HCl and the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism were responsible for Hg 0 transformation.

Where, StSA(s), StCl(s), and StHgCl(s) represent the unoccupied,

tive site. Niksa et al. [154] also proposed the heterogeneous Hg/Br
reaction  paths  on  unburned  carbon  surface,  which  were  similar
to Hg/Cl on unburned carbon surface. The minor differences were
that  Hg 0  adsorption  was  faster  on  brominated  sites,  and  higher
Br in flue gas accelerated the recombination reactions which kept
very low surface coverage of Hg/Br species.

In summary, the mercury heterogeneous reaction on fly ash in-
volving unburned carbon includes physical adsorption and chem-
ical reactions. The gaseous Hg 0  and Hg 2 +  physically absorbed on
the surface can form Hg 0 (ads) and Hg 2 + (ads), which are the Hg p .
The surface structure characteristics, including particle size, surface
area, etc., affect the physical adsorption, which have a positive re-
lationship with UBC. On the other hand, the Hg 0 (g) can react with
the active sites on the surface to generate Hg 2 + (ads) and Hg 2 + (g),
the active sites for which may be some certain unburned carbon
forms (anisotropic carbon particles), oxygen function groups (C = O,
OH/C –O, (O –C = O)–O), and halogens, etc. The factors affecting the
Hg 0 heterogeneous reaction on the fly ash surface concerning un-
burned carbon are illustrated in Fig. 10 .

vantages of easy accessibility, easy separation, nonsecondary pol-
lution,  and  a  lower  price  than  other  sorbents,  the  iron  oxides
in fly ash have gained significant attention. The normal range of

4.3.4. Flue gas components

Flue  gas  components  can  also  affect  the  Hg 0  heterogeneous
reaction  with  fly  ash  [78,139] .  Based  on  the  stepwise  regres-
sion analysis [117] , it is reported that chlorine promotes mercury
chemisorption onto fly ash while sulfur inhibits adsorption of oxi-
dized mercury onto fly ash. At a typical flue gas temperature, SO
2
inhibits fly ash-induced Hg 0 removal slightly while NO has a posi-
2 in the simulated flue gas [166] . For
tive effect with the help of Br
actual flue gas conditions, injection of HBr will enhance mercury
capture by Powder River Basin (PRB) fly ash in a low temperature
range  [167] .  The  overall  influence  of  NO
2  on  mercury  oxidation
with the presence of fly ash is greater than that of Cl generating
from HCl by the Deacon reaction [126] . The results from mercury
retention by fly ash or fractions of fly ash enriched in unburned
carbon  particles  conducted  in  a  fixed  bed  with  a  reaction  tem-
perature of 120 °C indicated that SO
2 might block the active sites
on the fly ash surface for a reduction in mercury retention while
HCl bound to the fly ash surface favored the retention of mercury
[168] . The mercury oxidation by fly ash in N
2 , air, and HCl, respec-
tively, showed that fly ash catalyzed Hg 0 oxidation and the more
stable mercury compounds bound to fly ash occurred in the HCl at-
2 O concentration in flue gas has the in-
mosphere [169] . The high H
hibitive influence on mercury oxidation by fly ash [153] . Moreover,
the active sites on fly ash for the Hg 0 heterogeneous reaction were
proposed by Zhao et al. [169] , which were low-binding-energy cat-
alytic oxidation active sites, catalytic oxidation active sites, adsorp-
tion active sites, and high-binding-energy adsorption active sites,
respectively.

Compared to the mercury homogenous reaction, the heteroge-
neous  reaction  mechanism  among  fly  ash,  flue  gas  components,
and mercury is complicated. Based on published studies, the works
for the mercury heterogeneous reaction mainly focus on the phys-
2 O
ical structure properties of fly ash, unburned carbon, and Fe
3 ,
while the influence of flue gas components (including NH
3 , etc.)
and wide reaction temperature ranges for the fly ash on mercury
oxidation or adsorption has rarely been investigated. Mercury het-
erogeneous reaction needs further study.

4.4. Oxy-coal combustion

4.4.1. Definition and characteristics of oxy-coal combustion

Greenhouse gas emissions are now known to be a serious en-
2  has caused widespread con-
vironmental problem, in which CO
cern. The amount of CO
2 emissions from electricity production all
over the world is mainly from CFPPs [170] . There are three main
ways to capture CO
2  from coal combustion: pre-combustion cap-
ture, oxy-coal combustion, and post-combustion capture [171,172] .
The oxy-coal combustion technology, considered to be a promis-
ing technology for CO
2 (about 95–98%) and
2 capture, uses pure O
recycled flue gas for coal burning. The main flue gas components
for the oxy-coal combustion are CO
2 O, which can realize
2 [170,173] . The recycled flue gas
the separation and storage of CO
can be extracted from an outlet of the ESP or WFGD, and the non-
recycled flue gas is cleaned by the APCDs, which will be purified
for CO
2  storage. This technology has the advantages of easy CO
2
capture, being easily established in the existing CFPPs, and low in-
vestment, etc. [173–175] . The system diagram of the oxy-coal com-
bustion technology is shown in Fig. 12 [176] .

2  and H

The gas components between air-coal and oxy-coal combustion
are shown in Table 5 [177] . It shows that the concentration of CO
2
and H
2 O in the outlet flue gas for oxy-coal combustion is higher
than that for air-coal combustion. Compared to air-coal combus-
tion, content of CO and SO
2  is also higher while that of NO x  is
lower under oxy-coal combustion [170,178,179] . Due to the low flue
gas volume and flue gas circulation, the fly ash concentration in
oxy-coal combustion flue gas is about 1.5-times greater than that
in air-coal combustion flue gas [177] . Moreover, the Cl content and

Hg 0 percentage (73%) under oxy-coal combustion compared to that
(69%) under air-coal combustion, which was different from the re-
sults of Wang et al. [185] . The investigation of air-coal and oxy-coal
combustion in a 20 kW
th drop-tube furnace indicated that the ra-
tio of Hg 2 + to total Hg g and total Hg g concentration were higher
under oxy-coal combustion [187,188] . Zhuang and Pavlish [176] and
Yang et al. [191] found that mercury concentration at the ESP inlet
in oxy-coal combustion was about two times of that under air-coal
combustion conditions based on the experiments in a 173.5 kW
th
and 35 MW
th pulverized coal furnace, which might be due to the
accumulative effect of flue gas recycling and the reduction in gas
volume  in  the  oxy-coal  combustion  process.  The  transformation
from Hg g to Hg p and Hg 0 to Hg 2 + is promoted under the oxy-coal
combustion, which is ascribed to continuous reactions of mercury
with enriched HCl, unburned carbon, and other flue gas compo-
th Com-
nents [176] . Mitsui et al. [183] , using data from the 1.5 MW
bustion & Air Quality Control System (AQCS) test facility, indicated
that mercury concentration at the SCR inlet in oxy-coal combustion
was  more  than  that  in  air-coal  combustion.  Experiments  on  the
Callide Oxy-fuel Project (20 MW
th  oxy-PCC demonstration plant)
showed that Hg 2 + was the main form in the flue gas after the cy-
clone (68%) or the stack (99% or 89%) [189,190] .

Based on these results, it can be found that total Hg g concentra-
tion is higher for oxy-coal combustion than that for air-coal com-
bustion. However, there is still a disagreement in the proportion of
Hg 2 +  to total Hg g . In addition, mercury emission data from oxy-
coal combustion is sparse, especially the concentration and distri-
bution of various mercury species, mercury removal efficiencies by
each APCD, etc.

4.4.3. Mercury transformation under oxy-coal combustion

Mercury transformation concerning homogeneous (without fly
ash)  and  heterogeneous  (with  fly  ash)  reaction  under  oxy-coal
combustion has been investigated by various studies. For the mer-
2 in the oxy-coal simulated flue gas
cury homogeneous reaction, O
is found to promote the reaction between Hg and Cl
2 , while NO
limits that reaction by consuming O and ClO radicals at a simu-
lated flue gas temperature of 200 °C [178] . About 15% of total mer-
cury is oxidized when Hg 0 is in an atmosphere of NO and N
2 . The
2 can lead to an increase in mercury ox-
co-existence of CO
idation, which has no relation with CO
2  concentration [179] . The
existence of H
2 O in oxy-coal combustion benefits mercury oxida-
tion (25–45%) compared to the dry atmosphere (9%) of 10 0 0 ppmv

Thus, knowing the emission and transformation of mercury during

4.4.2. Mercury emission from oxy-coal combustion

The studies on mercury emission from oxy-coal combustion has
been conducted by several researchers in different reactors, which
include drop tube furnace, bubbling fluidized bed, circulating flu-
idized bed (CFB), and pulverized coal furnace with input heat from
th [176,183–191] . Wang et al. [184] conducted the
6 kW
air-coal and oxy-coal combustion of two kinds of coal on a 6 kW

CFB, the results of which showed that Hg 2 +  concentration under
oxy-coal combustion was lower than that under air-coal combus-
tion.  The  higher  percentage  of  Hg 2 +  under  oxy-coal  combustion

Total gaseous mercury (Hg g , total Hg g = Hg 2 + + Hg 0 ) concentration
under oxy-coal combustion (26 μg/Nm 3 ) was higher than that un-
der air-coal combustion (20 μg/Nm 3 ). In addition, there was a lager

coal combustion inhibited Hg 0 oxidation in the atmosphere of 6%

inar, methane-fired, bench-scale, quartz-lined reactor, Hg 0  oxida-
tion by HCl under oxy-firing conditions was higher than that un-
der air combustion. The addition of NO (less than 300 ppmv) and
2 (less than 400 ppmv) had little or no influence on the Hg 0 ox-
SO
idation by chlorine under both firing conditions [123] . Wang et al.

Based on these works, the following summary for the mercury
homogenous transformation under the oxy-coal combustion can be

drawn: (1) O

inhibit or do not favor that reaction; (2) CO
2  limits Hg 0  oxidation
idation in NO and N
2  atmospheres; (3) SO
while HCl has a higher oxidation effect on Hg 0  than that under
2 O on Hg 0
air-coal combustion conditions; and (4) the effect of H
oxidation has not come to an agreement yet, which may be re-
lated to the flue gas temperature or flue gas components. In ad-
dition,  most  explanations  for  the  effects  of  flue  gas  components
on mercury transformation in the oxy-coal combustion atmosphere
are only speculation without credible evidence. The mercury ho-
mogeneous transformation models under oxy-coal combustion are
sparse, which is important for the prediction of mercury species.

For the mercury heterogeneous transformation, fly ash is con-
sidered to be a main pathway for Hg 0  oxidation under oxy-coal
combustion conditions. The work on a fixed-bed experimental rig
showed  that  SO
3  reduced  mercury  adsorption  on  fly  ash,  while
mercury  capture  by  fly  ash  decreased  as  temperature  increased
[195] .  In  the  simulated  oxy-coal  combustion  flue  gas  (30%  H
2 O,
2 , 60-ppmv HCl, and 700 °C), the Hg 0 oxidation rate increased
6% O
from 37% (without fly ash) to 80% (with fly ash), which indicated
that fly ash had a significant promotional role on Hg 0  oxidation.
This may be due to many active sites on unburned carbon surface
in fly ash, which not only benefit the conversion of HCl to oxida-
tive Cl but also provide possible favorable sites for Hg 0 oxidation
2 under ac-
[193] . Izquierdo et al. [196] found that the increase of O
tual oxy-coal combustion conditions had little effect on the relative
partition between Hg p and Hg g , from the results in a 3 kW
th bub-
bling fluidized bed combustor. Combining the mercury adsorption
and desorption experiments under a simulated oxy-coal combus-
tion flue gas atmosphere, organic mercury, and HgS were the main

mercury species in fly ash. In addition, mercury TPD analysis indi-
cated mercury retention by fly ash was mainly by the carbon [197] .

which was caused by the generation of some active sites via reac-
tion between H
2 O and carbon-oxygen complexes or changes of the
surface conditions [198] .

Based on the literature review, mercury heterogeneous trans-
formation in the oxy-coal combustion atmosphere can be summa-
rized: (1) fly ash plays an important role for Hg 0 oxidation; (2) SO
3
inhibits mercury retention by fly ash while H
2 O promotes this phe-
nomenon; and (3) there is no agreement in distribution between
Hg p and Hg g affected by O
2 . In fact, little work has been conducted
on the mercury heterogeneous transformation with fly ash under
oxy-coal combustion conditions. Further works should include the
following: (1) difference in characteristics of fly ash between the
air-coal and oxy-coal combustion atmosphere, such as physical sur-
face structure, chemical composition, and mercury compounds in
fly ash; (2) effects of typical flue gas components on mercury re-
action by fly ash in a wide temperature range; and (3) establish-
ment of models of mercury heterogeneous transformation, which
helps in the development of mercury prediction in actual oxy-coal
combustion flue gas.

5. Sampling, co-removal, and emission of mercury in coal-fired
power plants

5.1. On-site mercury sampling methods

There are three main methods to sample mercury in flue gas
in CFPPs, namely, the wet-chemistry method based on the OHM,
the sorbent-trap method based on the US Environmental Protec-
tion  Agency  (US  EPA)  Method  30B,  and  the  mercury-continuous
emission monitoring system (Hg-CEMS) [199] , all of which are de-
scribed in detail as follows.

5.1.1. Ontario Hydro Method

The  Ontario  Hydro  Method  (OHM),  the  internationally  recog-
nized method for flue gas mercury sampling in CFPPs, uses chem-
ical solutions to selectively adsorb Hg g . It can also separate Hg p
from  Hg g  and  determine  specific  Hg g  species  (namely  Hg 0  and
Hg 2 + ) [200,201] . The schematic diagram of the OHM mercury sam-
pling  device  is  shown  in  Fig.  14  [86] .  It  mainly  consists  of  a

sampling probe, glass filter, impinger box, vacuum line, pump, and
a metering console. During sampling, mercury in flue gas is with-
drawn  isokinetically  via  the  probe  and  the  filter  with  the  tem-
perature maintained at 120 °C, followed by a series of impingers
in  an  ice  bath.  The  Hg p  is  collected  at  the  filter  in  the  form  of
particle. The first three impingers containing 1.0 mol/L KCl solu-
tion are used to adsorb Hg 2 + , while the fourth impinge with 5%
2 solution and last three impingers with
(V/V) HNO
4 solution are used for Hg 0 cap-
4% (w/V) KMnO
ture.  The  mercury  in  fly  ash  and  absorbing  solution  can  be  de-
termined  by  the  relevant  mercury  analyzer,  and  the  concentra-
tion of each mercury species in flue gas can be calculated by the
data of mercury analysis value, fly ash mass, flue gas volume, and
the volume related with absorbing solution. To ensure accuracy of
the test data, OHM requires that relative standard deviation (RSD)
should be less than 34% when mercury concentration is lower than
3 μg/m 3 . Otherwise, the RSD should be less than 11% if mercury
concentration is higher than 3 μg/m 3 [46] .

5.1.2. US EPA Method 30B

The US EPA Method 30B uses solid mercury adsorbent to cap-
ture mercury in flue gas, which can adsorb the total Hg g or spe-
cific mercury species (Hg 0 and Hg 2 + ) based on the adsorbent type.
The schematic diagrams of US EPA Method 30B for Hg g and spe-
cific mercury species are shown in Fig. 15 (a) [202] and Fig. 15 (b)
[203] , respectively. In general, the activated carbon (AC) modified
by halogens acts as the adsorbent to adsorb total gaseous mercury,
while the oxidized mercury is adsorbed by a special adsorbent.

From Fig. 15 (a) and (b), it can be seen that there are two identi-
cal adsorbents in the trap for mercury adsorption, where the front
part is called mercury collection and the latter is called mercury
breakthrough. To ensure the accuracy of mercury data sampled by
this method, the breakthrough rate (BR) and relative deviation (RD)
are selected as the main parameters for quality control based on
quality  assurance  and  quality  control  (QA/QC)  criteria  [204,205] ,
which  requires  that  BR  and  RD  should  be  no  more  than  10%  if
total  Hg g  concentration  is  higher  than  1 μg/m 3  while  the  values
should be no more than 20% when the total Hg g concentration is
lower than 1 μg/m 3 . The expressions of BR and RD are shown as

5.1.3. Mercury-continuous emission monitoring system

The  mercury  continuous  emission  monitoring  system  (Hg-
CEMS) can monitor the real-time concentration of different Hg g ,
including Hg g , Hg 2 + , and total Hg g . It is mainly composed of pre-
treatment/conversion  unit  and  analysis  unit,  the  schematic  dia-
gram of which is shown in Fig. 16 . At present, the mercury an-
alyzer  can  only  determine  the  Hg 0  concentration.  Thus,  Hg 2 +  in
flue gas should be firstly transformed into Hg 0 , and then be deter-
mined. There are two ways to transform Hg 2 + into Hg 0 , which are
(1) wet chemical reduction method using SnCl
2  solution, and (2)
high-temperature catalyst or high-temperature heating conversion
method.

5.1.4. Comparison of OHM, US EPA Method 30B, and Hg-CEMS

The OHM, which has been accepted as a standard mercury sam-
pling method worldwide, can determine Hg p , Hg 0 , and Hg 2 + in the
flue gas. The data from this method is usually used to check the ac-
curacy of data from US EPA Method 30B and Hg-CEMS. However, it
needs a long mercury sampling time (about 2–3 h) and larger flue
gas volume (about 1–2.5 m 3 , dry flue gas) for each time of mercury
sampling. OHM can not give the real-time mercury concentration.
In  addition,  the  mercury  sampling  operation  is  complicated  and
needs a significant number of chemical solutions and skilled oper-
ators. It is reported that Cl
2 in flue gas can form hypochlorite ion
in KCl solution, which can oxidize a certain amount of Hg 0 to Hg 2 +
in the solution [206] . The experiments of Linak et al. [207] showed
2  in a simulated flue gas
that the low concentration of 1-ppm Cl
mixture resulted in a bias of 10–20% of Hg 0 misreported as Hg 2 +
for the OHM. The existence of SO
2  in flue gas or the addition of
3 can inhibit the oxidation in the solution [208,209] . In fact,
Na
the existence of SO
2 in actual coal combustion flue gas eliminates
this bias of mercury speciation measurements, but it might be a
problem  for  the  few  combustor  or  research  works  where  Cl
2  is
present with little SO
2 [207] . The obtained mercury concentration
in flue gas is affected by the sampling operation, purity of chemi-
cal solutions, error in recovery, and digestion of the absorption so-
lution, etc.

2 O

2 S

Compared  to  the  OHM,  the  sampling  operation  of  US  EPA
Method 30B, which uses mercury adsorbent traps instead of the
absorption solution in OHM, is simpler. It saves the time and cost
for preparation, recovery, and digestion of the absorption solution.
For US EPA Method 30B, the mercury sampling needs about 1–3 h
with a flue gas volume of 20–100 L; it cannot monitor the online
mercury concentration. Generally, it cannot determine Hg p in flue
gas without collection of fly ash. Moreover, the flue gas compo-
2 or NO x concentration, will affect the accu-
nent, such as high SO
racy of the data. Thus, the method is usually applied at the outlet
of FGD. The types of mercury adsorbent and adsorption efficiency
are other factors that influence the accuracy of the data.

With implementation of the increasingly strict emission stan-
dards  for  mercury  from  coal-fired  flue  gas,  Hg-CEMS  is  encour-
aged  to  be  installed  in  CFPPs.  Different  from  OHM  and  US  EPA
Method 30B, the Hg-CEMS can give the real-time mercury emis-
sion concentration, which is very important for providing immedi-
ate feedback for boiler operation and applied removal technology
concerning mercury concentration. However, it can not determine
Hg p  concentration.  In  addition,  Hg-CEMS  involves  high  purchase
and maintenance costs, as well as periodic calibration tests. The
comparison of OHM, US EPA Method 30B, and Hg-CEMS is shown
in Table 6 .

5.2. Co-removal efficiencies across air pollution control devices

With more stringent emission limits on air pollutants from coal
combustion,  the  install  share  of  APCDs,  such  as  SCR  equipment,

used for removal of NOx, PM, SO

CFPPs. Taking China as an example, almost 90% of CFPPs have been
equipped with ESP, while the rest have ESP + FF [2] . By the end of
2 removal devices in total thermal
2007, the installed capacity of SO
power unit capacity was more than 50% with little share of SCR

[210] . However, the installed capacity of SO
2  control devices and
SCR equipments has accounted for 93.0% of total coal-fired gener-
ating unit capacity and 85.8% of the total thermal power unit ca-
pacity, respectively, by the end of 2016 [211] . It has been confirmed
that these APCDs have a co-removal effect on mercury emission

removal efficiencies by various APCDs in CFPPs, the data is mainly
from  China.  It  should  be  updated  in  light  of  the  large  installa-
tion share and many new APCDs combination types at present. In
this section, the field-test data of mercury co-removal efficiencies
across APCDs, mercury emission concentration in flue gas to the
atmosphere, and mercury content in coal CBPs in CFPPs is collected
from almost all the papers published from 20 0 0 to 2018 around
the world, as shown in Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary ma-
terial [85,86,199,213–239] . The Hg 0 oxidation rate across SCR and

5.2.1. Selective catalytic reduction

3 , TiO

5 , WO

SCR equipment is used for NO x removal from coal combustion
3  as a reducing agent. The SCR catalysts
in CFPPs, which uses NH
are mainly composed of V
2 with a working temper-
2 O
ature of 30 0–40 0 °C [240] . Field tests on mercury concentration in
flue gas at the inlet and outlet of SCR have shown that the SCR
device also has a co-effect on Hg 0 oxidation [241] . It is confirmed
that active Cl is the oxidizer for Hg 0  oxidation on the SCR cata-
lyst surface. Hg-Cl and NO –NH
3 redox reactions occur on the active
sites of SCR catalysts simultaneously [240] . Some mechanisms have
been proposed to elaborate the Hg 0 oxidation process across SCR
catalysts. These mechanisms include: (1) HCl is firstly absorbed on
the catalysts to produce active sites and then react with gaseous
or weakly bound Hg 0 [242] ; (2) the Eley-Rideal reaction, which in-
volves Cl compounds as intermediates [243,244] ; and (3) hetero-
geneous reactions, which obey the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mecha-
nism [245] . The detailed Hg 0 oxidation mechanism across SCR cat-
alysts needs further study, and it can be studied by a combination
of experiments and theoretical calculation.

Under the actual operation conditions in CFPPs, Hg 0 oxidation
by SCR device can be affected by flue gas components, boiler load,
SCR space velocity, SCR catalyst structure, and service time of the
catalysts.

(1) Flue gas components: Increasing HCl content in flue gas pro-
motes Hg 0  oxidation, while increasing the NH
3 /NO ratio at
SCR inlet reduces Hg 0  oxidation [243] . In addition, the in-
teractions of O
2 O, etc. may play a role on
3 , H
Hg 0 oxidation.

2 , CO, SO x , NH

(2) Boiler load: Decreasing boiler load increases Hg 0  oxidation
[246] . In fact, the boiler load has a relationship with the flue
gas temperature, and decreasing flue gas temperature ben-
efits Hg 0 oxidation. Studies observed that the mercury oxi-
dation rate increased from 50% at 410 °C to 78% at 290 °C in
a flue gas atmosphere with 10-ppmv HCl while it increased
from 8% at 320 °C to 43% at 260 °C in a flue gas of 0.3-ppmv
3 [113] .
HCl, 70-ppmv SO
(3) SCR space velocity: Increasing space velocity decreases Hg 0

oxidation by SCR [247] .

(4) SCR catalyst structure: The different structures of SCR cat-
alysts have various specific surface areas. The honey-comb
structure generally has higher Hg 0 oxidation efficiency than
the plate type [248] .

(5) Service time of the catalysts: A long service time of the cat-

alysts decreases Hg 0 oxidation ability [246] .

To evaluate the effects of SCR device on Hg 0 oxidation, the Hg 0
oxidation rate is adopted. Based on the data in Table S1, the Hg 0
oxidation rate across SCR device in CFPPs is in the range of 6.5–
79.9%.

5.2.2. Electrostatic precipitator and fabric filter

The ESP and FF are good at capturing Hg p in flue gas, benefit-
ing from the higher PM removal efficiency ( > 99%). With flue gas
cooling, some parts of Hg 0 and Hg 2 + will be adsorbed on fly ash
to generate Hg p , and Hg 0 will react with fly ash to produce Hg 2 +
or Hg p . Compared to ESP, FF has a higher PM removal ability, espe-
cially for fine PM. Thus, the mercury removal rate for FF is higher
than that for ESP, which can be found in Zhang et al. [225] (ESP-
11.5%,  FF-52.3%),  Cui  et  al.  [199]  (ESP-68.3%,  FF-70.0–71.6%),  and
Tian et al. [237] (ESP-33.17%, FF-67.92%) in Table S1.

The  mercury  removal  rate  across  ESP  or  FF  is  influenced  by
flue gas temperature, mercury species in flue gas, fly ash compo-
nents (unburned carbon and metal oxides), capture ability of ESP
or FF for PM, etc. [221] . According to the data in Table S1, the Hg t
removal rate for ESP and FF is 11.5–90.4% and 28.5–90%, respec-
tively. Wang et al. [249] summarized that average Hg t removal rate
for ESP in China, the US, South Korea, and Japan was 22%, 36%,
59%,  and  52%,  respectively.  In  addition,  Sung  et  al.  [233]  found
that more Hg 2 + was generated when flue gas passed through FF,
compared  to  ESP,  which  benefited  its  removal  by  WFGD.  Under
the same conditions, installing FF between ESP and WFGD made
mercury removal efficiency across the whole APCDs increase from
62.44% to 86.73%.

rate  across WFGD  device  is  in  the  range  of  83.45–94.53%.  How-
ever, in some cases the Hg 0  re-emission occurs during the Hg 2 +
removal process in the WFGD device, which is thought to be ex-
plained by two reasons [229,86] : (1) Hg 2 + and Hg 0 in flue gas can
2 2 + on the water layer on the external surface of desul-
generate Hg
2 2 +  reacts with OH − in seriflux to generate Hg 0
furizer. Then, Hg
2 in flue gas can reduce HgO to form Hg 0 . This is de-
and HgO. SO
scribed by reactions (38) –(40) ; (2) Hg 2 + dissolved in scrubber so-
lution can react with sulfite and sulfate to form HgSO
4 ,
in which sulfite and sulfate are from SO
2  dissolving in scrubber
4 may further participate in
3 and HgSO
solution. A portion of HgSO
some reactions to release Hg 0 . This is described as reactions (41) –
(42) . Moreover, the Hg 0  re-emission is affected by the operating
temperature, pH, O
2  concentration in flue gas, transitional metal
ions concentration, etc. It is found that high availability of excess
oxygen in the flue gas contacting with the desulfurization solution
leads to the lower reduction of Hg 2 + to Hg 0 while decreasing the
slurry pH or increasing the operating temperature enhances Hg 0
re-emission significantly [250,251] . However, Wu et al. [252] found
the opposite results by doing the Hg 0 re-emission experiments in
a lab-scale simulated scrubber, which indicated that the increase
of the slurry pH resulted in the increase in Hg 0 re-emission con-
centration.

The WFGD device is installed to removal SO

tion, fine PM can also be captured by the WFGD device. Due to
high water-solubility of Hg 2 +  in flue gas, WFGD device has high
co-capture ability. Based on the data in Table S1, the Hg 2 + removal

5.3. Emission concentration and emission factor

To  meet  strict  emission  limits,  WESP  is  installed  widely  in
the  ultra-low  emission  (ULE)  power  plants  and  has  an  impor-
tant role in collecting ultrafine particles and aerosols. Zhang et al.
[229] found WESP also has the co-effect for Hg t capture with a re-
moval rate of 34.52–47.42%. When the flue gas went through the
WESP, concentration of both Hg 2 + and Hg 0 decreased. Studies by
the US Department of Energy [253] indicated that the average re-
moval rate of Hg 0 , Hg 2 + , and Hg p in flue gas by WESP was 32–40%,
72–82%, and 33–100%, respectively. It is known that Hg 2 + and Hg p
can be collected by WESP, while there should be transformation of
Hg 0 to Hg 2 + or Hg p for Hg 0 removal. It is inferred that electrode
of WESP can produce an electronic corona, which results in gener-
ation of free radicals, such as O, OH, O
2 O,
and HCl by gas discharge. Thus, the Hg 0 in flue gas will be oxidized
into Hg 2 + by free radicals and then form Hg p . The transformation
process of Hg 0 to Hg 2 + can be interpreted by reactions (43) –(54)
[254–258] .

5.2.5. Combination of each air pollution control device

Based on the above discussion, it can be found that each APCD,
such  as  SCR,  ESP,  FF, WFGD,  and WESP,  has  a  positive  effect  on
flue gas mercury removal. Pudasainee et al. [221] reported the re-
lationship between the flue gas mercury oxidation rate of SCR or
removal rate of ESP, and WFGD with the total removal rate across
SCR + ESP + WFGD,  which  is  shown  in  Fig.  18 (a)–(c).  The  Hg t  re-
moval rate by SCR + ESP + WFGD has a strong relationship with mer-
cury removed by ESP, which is followed by WFGD and SCR device.
Because  many  factors,  like  coal  type,  flue  gas  components,  mer-
cury species in flue gas, fly ash composition, and operation condi-
tions, can affect the mercury removal rate by the APCD, it should
be  given  specific  treatment  to  evaluate  the  contribution  of  each
APCD for the Hg t removal rate. According to summarized data in
Table S1, the Hg t  removal rate for ESP + WFGD, SCR + ESP + WFGD,
SCR + ESP + FF + WFGD,  and  SCR + ESP + WFGD + WESP  is  35.5–84%,
43.8–94.9%, 58.78–73.32%, and 56.59–89.07%, respectively.

Hg t emission concentration in flue gas from the stack of CFPPs
to the atmosphere has raised widespread concern. Some countries,
such  as  China  and  the  US,  have  issued  relevant  limits  for  mer-
cury in flue gas emitted from CFPPs, which are 30 μg/m 3  (China)
[15] , 7 μg/m 3  (bituminous, the US), 20–35 μg/m 3  (subbituminous,
the US), 60 μg/m 3 (lignite, the US), and 6 μg/m 3 (coal gangue, the
US)  [259] ,  respectively.  Based  on  the  data  in  Table  S2,  mercury
emission concentration for China and South Korea is in the range
of 0.29–9.16 μg/m 3 and 0.48–16.3 μg/m 3 , respectively, while that for
Poland, the Netherlands, and the US is within the range of 2.0–
15.1 μg/m 3 .

To compare the mercury emission situations from different CF-
PPs, the mercury emission factor (MEF) is adopted in the work. The
MEF can be described as the ratio of the ultimate mercury emit-
ted to the atmosphere to the heat value coming from the feed-
ing  coal  [118] .  From  Table  S2,  the  MEF  for  the  CFPPs  in  China
ranges from 0.052–12.06 g/10 12 J. The MEF for 80 CFPPs in the US
with burning bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite coal is 0.046–
12.50 (average 1.63), 0.198–4.565 (average 2.08), and 1.723–24.04
(average 6.79) g/10 12 J, respectively, while that for Poland is 0.71–
6.09 g/10 12 J.

5.4. Mercury content in combustion by-products

Though there are no specific mercury emission standards on the
CBPs  from  CFPPs,  the  mercury  content  in  the  CBPs  needs  to  be
given attention, which can provide guidance for their subsequent
use and processing. Mercury content in bottom ash is extremely
low, with a range of 1.0 × 10 −4 –< 0.3 mg/kg, which is mainly due
to the high formation temperature. With flue gas cooling, part of
the mercury in flue gas can be transformed into Hg p through ab-
sorption or heterogeneous reaction between mercury and fly ash.
The  mercury  concentration  in  the  fly  ash,  summarized  in  Table
S2,  ranges  from  0.009  to  1.89 mg/kg,  which  is  obviously  higher
than the range of mercury concentration in bottom ash. With mer-
cury removal by WFGD and WESP, the concentration of mercury
in  gypsum,  WFGD  wastewater,  and  WESP  wastewater  is  0.006–
6.16 mg/kg,  1.0 × 10 −5 –10 mg/L,  and  9 × 10 −4 –0.867 mg/L,  respec-
tively.  Comparing  to  the  relevant  standards  for  soil  and  ground
water that are proposed by the State Technical Supervision Bureau
and National Environmental Protection Agency in China, which are
0.50 mg/kg for soil focused on agricultural production and human
health, and 0.001 mg/L for water applied in drinking and agricul-
tural irrigation, respectively [260,261] , mercury in some fly ash and
gypsum  as  well  as  most  WFGD  and WESP  wastewater  is  higher
than  the  limits,  which  needs  to  be  dealt  with  care  during  their
processing.

In summary, the APCDs in CFPPs have a positive effect on flue
gas mercury removal, in which SCR, ESP or FF, and WFGD are good
at  Hg 0  oxidation,  Hg p  capture,  and  Hg 2 +  removal,  respectively.
WESP also has the flue gas mercury removal ability. Due to the
diversity and complexity in coal properties, flue gas components,
mercury forms in flue gas, fly ash composition, operation condi-
tions, etc., the Hg 0 oxidation by SCR equipment, mercury removal
efficiency  across  APCDs,  flue  gas  emission  concentration,  and
mercury  content  in  CBPs  vary  widely.  For  mercury  co-removal
and  emission  in  CFPPs,  the  following  studies  need  to  be  done:
(1)  detail  mercury  transformation  or  the  removal  mechanism
across  each  APCD;  (2)  determine  the  way  to  improve  the  Hg 0
oxidation rate in SCR equipment, or removal efficiency by APCDs;
(3) obtain more mercury content data in CBPs, and give relevant
emission  limits;  and  (4)  define  the  chemical  species  of  mercury
in fly ash and gypsum, which is important for their utilization or
disposal.

6. Mercury removal technologies for coal-fired power plants

Based  on  the  mercury  removal  position  in  the  CFPPs,  mer-
cury removal technologies can be divided into pre-combustion, in-
combustion,  and  post-combustion  mercury  removal  technologies.
The pre-combustion technology introduced is to remove mercury
from coal before coal burning, which mainly includes coal wash-
ing  and  mild  pyrolysis  methods.  The  in-combustion  technology
includes  low-NO x  combustion  technology,  CFB  combustion  tech-
nology, coal blending, and the use of oxidizing chemicals in the
coal or furnace. The post-combustion technology mainly includes
the existing APCDs, mercury oxidizing catalysts, injecting oxidizing
chemicals into the flue gas, and mercury sorbents injection. Both
the  in-combustion  and  post-combustion  mercury  removal  tech-
nologies  are  to  transform  more  Hg 0  into  easily  capturable  Hg 2 +
and  Hg p  and  then  remove  them  by  the  existing  APCDs.  Accord-
ing to the composition of adsorbents, mercury removal adsorbents
can  be  classified  into  carbon-based  adsorbents  (AC,  biochar,  and
petroleum  coke),  fly  ash,  calcium-based  adsorbents,  and  mineral

adsorbents. Recently, some novel mercury control approaches have
been developed to improve the mercury removal efficiency and re-
duce the mercury removal cost further, which include regenerable
mercury removal adsorbent and multipollutant control technology.
The technologies for in-combustion and post-combustion mercury
removal in CFPPs are shown in Fig. 19 [81] .

6.1. Pre-combustion mercury removal

6.1.1. Coal washing technology

The  coal  washing  technologies  can  be  divided  into  physical
and non-physical. The physical washing technology for mercury re-
moval is based on the density and surface physical-chemical prop-
erties of the components in the coal. Generally, mercury is mainly
associated  with  pyrite  and  clay  in  coal.  The  washed  coal  is  hy-
drophobic while the most impurity components are hydrophilic. In
the physical coal washing process, the mercury will accumulate in
flotation residue and then be removed. Physical coal washing tech-
nologies  include  conventional  and  advanced  physical  separation

methods, such as dense media separation, froth flotation, and en-
hanced gravity concentration, etc. [262] . Smit et al. [263] adopted
column flotation and selective agglomeration to study the mercury
concentration changes in coal before and after coal washing based
on five types of coal.  Results showed that conventional washing
and column flotation reduced mercury concentration in raw coal in
the range of 40–> 57% with average value of 55%. Selective agglom-
eration reduced the mercury content in coal by 8–38% with an av-
erage of 16%. Ferris and Bencho [264] used a heavy-media cyclone
(conventional cleaning method) followed by a water-only cyclone
and a column flotation system to clean three types of coal. Results
showed that mercury concentration reduction was 42–45% in the
raw coals by heavy-media cyclone and 21–23% in the cleaned coals
by water-only cyclone and column flotation system. A combination
of these methods reduced mercury concentration in the coals by
63–65%. Neme [265] found that physical washing removed 0–26%
of mercury for the US midwestern bituminous coals. Brown et al.
[266] observed that the average mercury reduction rate for vari-
ous commercial operations by conventional washing methods was
21–37%. For the US, the coal washing rate for bituminous coal and
western coal is reported as approximately 77% and 10–15%, respec-
tively [75] . For China, the coal washing rate is relatively low, which
is 11.2%, 31.7%, and 10.9% for Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Shaanxi
(main raw coal production regions), respectively [267] . The differ-
ent physical coal washing methods and coal types affect the mer-
cury  removal  rate  from  coal  significantly,  which  has  wide  range
from 0% to 65% as mentioned above. The coal washing rate needs
improvement, especially for China. Thus, it is hard to meet mer-
cury removal requirements only by coal washing. In addition, phys-
ical coal washing technology may cause water or soil pollution by
mercury and an increase in capital investment, which also needs
attention.

Non-physical coal washing technologies have been explored by
the US Department of Energy: magnetic separation to capture mer-
cury in the form of pyrite (dry coal cleaning), mild chemical treat-
ments,  and  naturally  occurring  microbes  [266] .  Though  the  in-
creased liberation of the pyrite caused by the particle size reduc-
tion in the pulverizer might reduce the mercury removal cost for
dry  coal  cleaning,  the  removal  rate  significantly  depends  on  the
content  of  pyrite-bound  mercury.  In  addition,  the  chemical  coal
cleaning method is considered as a high-cost control technology.

processed while the processed coal can be used for stockpile or
direct combustion.

Keener et al. [51,269] studied the thermal release characteris-
tics of mercury in several bituminous coals, finding that maximum
mercury removal of approximately 80% was achieved at a tempera-
ture of 400 °C. Guffey and Bland [268] studied the effects of pyrol-
ysis parameters on mercury removal from low-rank PRB coal and
lignite, which indicated that the mercury removal rate was positive
to residence time and the sweep gas flow rate. A residence time of
4 min led to the maximum mercury removal efficiency, while in-
creasing the sweep gas flow rate from 10 to 125 cm 3 /min increased
the  removal  rate  from  40%  to  74%.  Chmielniak  et  al.  [270]  used
the mild pyrolysis method to remove mercury from lignite and an-
thracite coal, finding that mercury removal efficiency for lignite at
a temperature of 300 °C was about 93%, while that for hard coal at
a temperature of 350 °C was only approximately 24%. Minami et al.
[271]  showed  that  the  thermal  treatment  temperature  of  200 °C
could remove about 30% of mercury from Alberta subbituminous
coals. The mild pyrolysis method can remove mercury from coal to
a certain extent. However, the mercury removal rate has a wide
range,  which  is  affected  by  the  thermal  treatment  temperature,
residence time, sweep gas flow rate, and, especially, the mercury
forms in coal.

6.2. In-combustion mercury removal

6.1.2. Mild pyrolysis method

The  US  Western  Research  Institute  developed  the  pre-
combustion mild pyrolysis concept for mercury removal from coal,
which is shown in Fig. 20 [268] . There are two zones in this con-
cept:  one  is  to  remove  moisture  in  coal  with  a  temperature  of
approximately 149 °C, and the other is a hazardous air pollutants
(HAPs) zone, which aims to remove the mercury with a tempera-
ture of about 288 °C. The volatilized mercury will be collected and

The low-NO x  combustion technology is beneficial for mercury
removal, which may be due to the increased oxidized mercury con-
tent  caused  by  the  low  operating  temperature  and  high  UBC  in
fly ash. The CFB combustion technology can enhance the chance
of mercury adsorption by fly ash by extending the residence time
of flue gas in the furnace. Coal blending is used to mix the coal
with different types of coal or biomass with the main purpose of

48

increasing Cl content, which favors the transformation of Hg 0  to
Hg 2 + or Hg p . Compared to these methods, putting chemicals into
coal to remove mercury is widely studied, in which halogens are
the most popular oxidant. This method has the advantages of sim-
ple operation, high mercury removal efficiency, and low cost.

Berry  [272]  conducted  a  field  test  at  Plant  Miller  to  study
the  effect  of  CaBr
2  on  mercury  oxidation,  the  results  of  which
showed that mercury oxidation efficiency increased from 60% to
90% under the addition of 5 mg/kg bromine to coal. Zhuang et al.
[273] found that adding 20 0–80 0 mg/kg (coal basis) of chlorine (in
the form of CaCl
2 ) into a 650 MW subbituminous CFPP equipped
with SCR + FF + WFGD could achieve an overall mercury removal
of 75–96%, which was only 18–32% without the addition. A series
of spot tests conducted by the US Government Accountability Of-
fice at 14 different power plants showed that the addition of 25–
2 to coal resulted in more than 90% of Hg 0 being
300 mg/kg CaBr
oxidized in flue gas [274] . Pan et al. [275] used numerical simula-
tion and experimental method to study the effect of NH
4 Cl injec-
tion into the furnace on mercury transformation, which found that
the  proportion  of  Hg 0  and  Hg 2 +  to  the  total  mercury  decreased
while that of Hg p increased as the addition amount of NH
4 Cl in-
creased. Shi [276] used US EPA Method 30B, OHM, and Hg-CEMS to
determine the mercury removal from a 300 MW power plant in-
stalled with SCR, ESP, and WFGD by putting CaBr
2  into the coal,
which  indicated  that  the  addition  amount  of  20,  50,  100,  and
200 mg/kg could reduce the gas mercury emission ratio by about
20%, 30%, 60%, and 30%, respectively. Zhou et al. [277] and Zhao
et al. [278] indicated that the gaseous Hg 0 concentration showed
a decreasing trend with increasing the addition amount of CaCl
2 ,
NH
4 Br, respectively. However, all the above studies fo-
cus on mercury removal rate, which neglect the detailed mercury
removal mechanism.

SCR system has been installed widely in CFPPs, due to its ad-
vantages of high DeNO x efficiency, selectivity, and economic feasi-
bility. The vanadia phase V
5 in typical commercial SCR catalysts
can not only catalyze the reduction of NO x  but also catalyze the
Hg 0 oxidation. Stolle et al. [279] found that the Hg 0 oxidation abil-
ity increased with increasing the concentration of V
5 in the SCR
catalyst.  This  finding  was  similar  to  the  results  of  Kamata  et  al.
[280] , which reported that the Hg 0 oxidation rate showed almost

6.3.2. Inhibiting Hg 0 re-emission in wet flue gas desulfurization

As described in Section 5.2.3 , Hg 0 re-emission, namely Hg 2 + re-
duction, will occur in WFGD, which reduces mercury removal effi-
ciency. To suppress this phenomenon, oxidants or special chemical
reagents are introduced in the desulfurization solution. Krzy  ̇zy  ́nska
et al. [290] found that the extent of scrubbed mercury increased
from  40%  to  70%  with  the  amount  of  NaClO
2  added  in  the
slurry  increasing  from  0.81  to  1.62 mol/L.  The  lab-scale  experi-
ments to achieve mercury reduction by adding aluminum sulfate
in the aqueous solutions and gypsum slurries were performed by
González et al. [291] , the results of which showed that the alu-
minum sulfate decreased the slurry pH to a level where the sulfite
ions,  responsible  for  mercury  reduction,  ceased  to  form.  The  ef-
fects of thiocyanate ions (SCN −) or sulfide ions (S 2 − and HS −) on
Hg 0 re-emission from simulated WFGD solutions were conducted
by  Wang  et  al.  [292] ,  who  concluded  that  both  thiocyanate  and
sulfide ions inhibited reduction of aqueous Hg 2 +  to Hg 0 . For the
thiocyanate ions addition, inhibition of mercury reduction was be-
cause of the formation of a sulfite-thiocyanate- mercury complex
3 SCN −)  and  thiocyanate-mercury  complex  [Hg(SCN)x −(x-2)
(HgSO
(x = 2–4)].  The  formation  of  HgS  could  be  the  main  reason  for
inhibition  of  mercury  reduction  with  sulfide  ions  addition.  Wu
et al. [252] reported that Hg 0 re-emission suppression rates could
reach 80.82% and 70.42% when adding 0.00125% (w/w) Na
4 and
0.0 0 05%  (V/V)  trisodium  salt  nonahydrate  (TMT15)  in  the  simu-
lated scrubber, respectively. Omine et al. [250] demonstrated the
influence of sulfide-based additives on Hg 0 re-emission in a sim-
ulated batch scrubber, which showed that the suppression effec-
tiveness of sodium hydrogen sulfide, sodium sulfide (Na
2 S), TMT15,
and the Nalco-8034 reagent was 99%, 97%, 93%, and 99%, respec-
tively.  These  additives  benefited  the  precipitation  of  ionic  mer-
cury as mercury sulfide. In addition, Na
2 S, 2,4,6-trimercaptotiazine,
TMT, and sodium dithiocarbamate (DTCR) were confirmed to be ef-
fective enough to suppress Hg 0  re-emission from simulated FGD
liquors by Tang et al. [293] , who found that the addition of these
agents could make more than 90% of ionic mercury into a precipi-
tate and decreased Hg 2 + reduction efficiency from 54% to less than
3%. Sun et al. [294] concluded that DTCR had a better inhibitive
performance than TMT for the stabilization of mercury in flue gas
desulfurization gypsum. In summary, the methods to inhibit Hg 0
re-emission in WFGD mainly involve adjusting the pH, or sulfite
ions concentration, or forming a precipitate of mercury. However,
all the current available data are from simulated lab-scale WFGD

a  high  Hg 0  oxidation  ability  from  150  to  250 °C,  in  which  the
high  content  of  surface  cerium  and  oxygen  was  the  reason  for
their superior performance. The CuO/TiO
2 catalyst is confirmed to
concurrently increase higher than the 80% NO reduction and 90%
Hg 0  oxidation  rate  by  the  experiments  at  250 °C  in  a  simulated
3 SCR atmosphere [303] . The Hg 0 capture by the activated coke

et  al.  [304] ,  the  results  of  which  indicated  that  Hg 0  capture  of

that Hg 0 oxidation on MnO x /TiO

tion over CeO

0.5:0.5:1 and resulted in more than 95% of the mercury oxidized.

and full-scale tests are needed in the following studies.

6.3.3. Mercury oxidizing catalysts

6.3.4. Injecting oxidizing chemicals

According to the components, mercury oxidizing catalysts can
be divided into noble metal-based catalysts and non-noble metal-
based catalysts.

For the noble metal-based catalysts, a noble metal, such as Au,
Pd, Pt, and Rh, is used as the active ingredient with potential Hg 0
oxidation ability, regeneration potential, and good stability at high
temperature [283] . Aboud et al. [295] used DFT calculation to in-
vestigate the binding mechanism of mercury on the binary alloys
PdAu(111),  PdAg(111),  and  PdCu(111),  finding  that  small  addition
amount  of  Au,  Ag,  and  Cu  alloyed  with  Pd  increased  the  over-
all  mercury  binding  energy.  Sasmaz  et  al.  [296]  concluded  that
Pd had the highest mercury binding energy compared to Au, Ag,
and  Cu,  and  the  location  of  Au,  Ag,  and  Cu  atoms  in  both  sur-
face and the subsurface layers affected the reactivity of the sur-
face. To obtain the maximum specific surface areas of the catalysts,
the noble metals are loaded on various porous materials, includ-
2 ),
ing  alumina  (Al
carbons,  and  zeolite,  etc.  Hou  et  al.  [297]  found  that  the  Al
2 O
3
loaded with 8 wt% Pd could remove 90% of mercury at operation
temperatures of up to 270 °C. Hrdlicka et al. [298] reported that
Au/TiO
3  had  an  effect  on  mercury  oxidation  with
rate of 40–60% and 50–80%, respectively, in a simulated flue gas.
Li and Wilcox [299] adopted the DFT to study the reaction mecha-
nism of mercury oxidation on Au (111), and found that mercury ox-
idation obeyed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism where each
Hg 0 and Cl
2 (or HCl) species was adsorbed on the gold surface sep-
arately then the bimolecular reaction occurred by the formation of
bound HgCl and HgCl

To  reduce  the  cost  of  noble  metal-based  catalysts,  the  non-
noble  metal  catalysts,  which  include  transition  metal  catalysts,
have been investigated. Recently, many studies on Hg 0  oxidation
involving  transition  metal  oxide  catalysts  (such  as  V
2 ,
2 ) loaded on various materials (alumina,
Co
silica,  titania,  carbons,  zeolite,  etc.)  have  been  extensively  con-
ducted. The lower-cost transition metal catalysts can exhibit high
catalytic  oxidation  activity  by  comparison  with  the  noble  metal
catalysts. Li et al. [300] combined the copper oxides and cerium
2  (CuCeTi) catalyst, the re-
oxides with TiO

Cao  et  al.  [167]  conducted  experiments  on  mercury  capture
by  adding  HBr  or  both  the  HBr  and  selected  fly  ash  in  real
flue  gas  in  a  slipstream  reactor.  Results  showed  that  HBr  injec-
tion  had  an  effective  ability  for  Hg 0  capture  at  a  low  tempera-
ture  of  155 °C,  which  could  obtain  Hg 0  oxidation  rate  of  higher
than 90% at the HBr addition concentration of 4 ppmv. Compared
to  only  the  addition  of  HBr,  the  simultaneous  injection  of  HBr
(4 ppmv) and bituminous coal-derived fly ash (minimum amount
of 4.80 × 10 5 μg/m 3 ) could increase the mercury removal rate by
30%.  The  enhancement  of  hydrogen  halogens  (HF,  HCl,  HBr,  and
HI)  injection  on  Hg 0  oxidation  was  also  investigated  in  the  PRB
coal combustion flue gas in the slipstream reaction with and with-
out SCR catalyst by Cao et al. [307] , which indicated that the im-
pact  level  of  the  hydrogen  halogens  on  Hg 0  oxidation  was  HBr,
HI,  and  HCl  or  HF,  in  decreasing  order.  An  injection  of  approx-
imately  3-ppmv  HBr  or  5-ppmv  HI  could  achieve  80%  and  40%
of  the  Hg 0  oxidation  rate  for  the  empty  bed.  However,  the  ad-
dition  concentration  of  HCl  should  increase  to  300  ppmv  to  get
a  40%  Hg 0  oxidation  rate.  Stolle  et  al.  [308]  carried  out  lab  ex-
periments  on  Hg  oxidation  and  reduction  through  the  commer-
cial V
2 honeycomb and plate-type DeNO x cat-
alysts, the results of which demonstrated that the addition of HBr
was ten times more effective than HCl in enhancing the Hg 0  ox-
idation under the same conditions based on the mass concentra-
tion. Wen et al. [309] used quantum chemistry, kinetic simulation,
and experimental methods to study the mechanism and kinetics of
the Hg 0  oxidation by injecting ozone in the flue gas. They found
that the Hg 0 oxidation ability of oxidizing radicals obeyed the de-
2 , which were generated during
creasing order of NO
ozone injection. The Hg 0 oxidation rate had a positive linear rela-
tionship with the mole ratio of O
3 /NO or the reaction temperature,
in which Hg 0  oxidation rate of about 32% and 39% could be ob-
3 /NO  mole  ratio  of  2.0  at  150 °C  and  a  reaction
tained  for  the  O
3 /NO mole ratio of 1.6. With the
temperature of 250 °C with the O
2 + HgO for Hg 0 oxidation, the con-
key reaction of Hg + NO
3  was the vital factor for influencing Hg 0  oxida-
centration of NO
tion. Martinez and Deshpande [310] added H
2 as a source of OH
radicals  to  promote  Hg 0  to  Hg 2 + ,  concluding  that  the  best  tem-
perature range for Hg 0 oxidation was 4 80–4 90 °C. With addition of
2 , the greatest Hg 0 oxidation rate of 68% could be
260-ppmv H
observed at 491 °C. The sensitivity analysis of the reaction mech-
anism indicated that the supplementing of OH radicals promoted
the atomic Cl formation, which enhanced the oxidation process by
accelerating the generation of HgCl

In summary, the main mercury control thought of injecting oxi-
dizing chemicals into flue gas to remove mercury is similar to that
of putting oxidizing chemicals into coal or furnace. The studied in-
jected oxidizing chemicals mainly include hydrogen halogens (HF,
HCl, HBr, and HI), ozone, and H
2 . The literature data shows that
2 O
HBr has the more effective ability of Hg 0  oxidation based on the
equal addition amount of oxidizing additives.

6.3.5. Carbon-based adsorbents
6.3.5.1. Activated carbon.  Injecting activated carbon (AC) upstream
of  the  particle  control  device,  such  as  ESP  or  FF,  has  been  con-
sidered to be a mature and promising mercury removal technol-
ogy,  the  mercury  removal  effects  of  which  have  been  evaluated
in bench, pilot, and field-scale tests [311–315] . The pilot and field
tests have shown that the mercury removal rate by AC sorbents
ranges from 25% to 95% with the mass ratio of carbon/mercury in-
creasing from 20 0 0 to 15,0 0 0 [75] . Lots of factors can affect the
mercury capture ability of the AC sorbents, including the surface
area,  particle  sizes,  and  pore  volume  of  AC;  mercury  concentra-
tion in flue gas; flue gas temperature; flue gas components; and
surface chemical properties; etc. [316,317] . Min et al. [318] found
that mercury adsorption efficiency showed a linear increase with
the BET surface area increasing in the baseline gas condition. The
increase in particle size would decrease the mercury adsorptive ca-
pacity significantly while high initial mercury concentration led to
the increase in mercury uptake [319] . Ochiai et al. [320] investi-
2  on mercury removal by AC sor-
gated the effects of HCl and SO
bents in simulated coal combustion flue gas, the results of which
indicated that increasing HCl concentration benefited Hg 0 removal
2 inhibited Hg 0 cap-
by the AC sorbents while the presence of SO
ture  with  the  presence  of  HCl.  Miller  et  al.  [321]  indicated  that
adding one of HCl, NO, or NO x at a time to the baseline gas (mix-
ture of O
2 O) could improve the mercury capture
rate to 90–100% from 10–20% (baseline gas conditions) by lignite-
based AC at 107 °C. With increasing the CO
2 concentration from 0%
to 12% at 150 °C, the mercury adsorption efficiency of Calgon F400
AC  decreased  from  about  60%  to  25%  [322] .  Li  et  al.  [149]  used
heat treatment (927 °C) in N
2 , air oxidation (420 °C), and nitric acid
(6 N HNO
3 ) treatment to vary the surface oxygen functional groups
on  two  ACs  and  found  that  lactone  and  carbonyl  groups  might
be beneficial for Hg 0  capture while phenol groups inhibited Hg 0
adsorption. Moreover, Liu et al. [323] confirmed that lactone, car-
bonyl, and semiquinone were the active sites for Hg 0  adsorption
and phenol and carboxyl functional groups indicated a physisorp-
tion of mercury, which reduced mercury capture through DFT cal-
culation.

The high cost is an important reason for limiting the wide ap-
plication  of  AC  injection  mercury  removal  technology;  it  is  es-
timated  that  the  cost  for  82%  mercury  removal  by  using  AC  is
between  $110,0 0 0  and  $150,0 0 0  per  kg  of  mercury  [317] .  Thus,
many  methods  are  used  to  modify  the  AC  to  improve  its  mer-
cury removal efficiency, including halogen (Br, Cl, I) impregnation
or  vapour  deposition  [324–328] ,  sulfur  impregnation  [329–331] ,
metal oxide or metal chloride modification [82,332–336] , and non-
thermal plasma (NTP) treatment [337–339] . Jang et al. [324] found
that  the  AC  impregnated  with  1%  of  KI  and  HCl  solutions  im-
proved the mercury adsorption efficiency to 80–100% and almost
100% within 1.5 h, respectively, whereas the mercury adsorption
efficiency was 60–80% for the raw AC. Zhou et al. [340] reported
that NH
4 Br-AC) had a significantly larger mer-
cury adsorption capability compared to the raw AC, and the mer-
cury  removal  efficiency  of  both  the  ACs  increased  with  an  in-
crease in inlet Hg 0 concentration. O
2 and NO in flue gas benefited
mercury adsorption on NH
2  had negative effects.
In general, mercury removal effects obey the increasing order of
AC  <  Cl-impregnated  AC  <  Br-impregnated  AC  <  I-impregnated

4 Br modified AC (NH

4 Br-AC while SO

AC  [341] .  The  DFT  calculation  of  Padak  et  al.  [342]  on  mercury
adsorption  by  halide-impregnated  AC  showed  that  the  sequence
of  mercury  binding  strength  on  halogenated  AC  was  F-AC  >  Cl-
AC > Br- AC > I-AC. This result differs from the above experimen-
tal results of Zhou et al. [340] , which indicates the adsorption en-
ergy  of  mercury  halide  species  on  AC  is  not  the  only  factor  for
mercury adsorption on halogenated AC. Rungnim et al. [343] used
the DFT method to investigate the reaction mechanisms of mer-
cury adsorption and oxidation on halogenated AC completely, by
adopting two different halogenated AC modes (namely, X-AC and
X-AC-X, X = Cl, Br, I). They showed that halide types did not influ-
ence the mercury adsorption energy but affected the activation en-
ergy barrier of HgX formation significantly, which increased in the
order of HgI < HgBr < HgCl. This trend agreed with experimen-
tal results that mercury removal efficiency by halogen-impregnated
AC decreased as I-AC > Br-AC > Cl-AC. The oxidation mechanism of
the  mercury  at  (a)  atop  and  (b)  bridge  sites  of  X-AC  and  X-AC-
X modes is shown in Fig. 22 (a) and (b), respectively. Some tests
indicated  that  obtaining  90%  mercury  capture  needed  injection
rates  of  8.01 × 10 4 μg  brominate  AC  (Br-AC)  per  cubic  meter  of
stack gas while the injection rate  for raw AC  was 16.03 × 10 4 –
32.06  × 10 4 μg/m 3  [317] .  Zhong  et  al.  [327]  compared  the  mer-
cury  removal  efficiency  by  the  AC  modified  with  different  halo-
gens (shown in Fig. 23 ) and concluded that AC modified by iodine
steam vapour deposition had a much better mercury removal abil-
ity than that modified by bromide deposition, as well as by NH
4 Br
and NaBr impregnation, under the same experimental conditions.

Generally, sulfur impregnation decreases the surface area while
increases the maximum Hg 0 adsorption capacity compared to the
raw AC fiber [311] . Sano et al. [344] found that the sulfur impreg-
nated AC contributed to a mercury adsorption 50- times greater
than  that  of  raw  AC.  Qiu  et  al.  [345]  showed  that  the  mer-
cury  removal  capacity  of  composite  sulfurized  activated  carbon
(CSAC), which was impregnated wth aqueous-phase Na
2 S and fol-
lowed with vapour phase elemental sulfur, was 1.5 times higher
than the AC impregnated with single elemental sulfur. Yan et al.
[329] concluded that mercury adsorption by sulphur-impregnated
carbon  involved  both  physical  and  chemical  processes.  Lee  and
Park [346] stated that the pore characteristics of raw AC and types
of  sulfur  are  the  main  factors  affecting  mercury  capture  perfor-
mance on sulfur-impregnated AC, rather than the amount of im-
pregnated sulfur. Hsi et al. [347] indicated that elemental sulfur,
organic sulfur, and sulfate were formed on the sorbents (including
AC, pistachio shell char and pistachio AC, and zeolite) in the sulfur
impregnation process, in which elemental and organic sulfur were
vital  active  sites  for  Hg 0  and  HgCl
2  adsorption.  In  addition,  Hsi
and  Chen  [330]  investigated  the  effects  of  acidic/oxidizing  gases
on Hg 0 adsorption behavior on sulfur-impregnated AC, the results
of  which  showed  that  mercury-capture  ability  was  promoted  as
one acidic/oxidizing component added in the baseline components

moval efficiency compared to raw AC and AC –N
2 , which was due
to the large increase of oxygen-containing functional groups (C = O
and C(O) −O −C) present on the AC surface. In addition, AC modified
in HCl could generate C –Cl groups, which benefited the improve-
ment of Hg 0 oxidizing ability. Zhang et al. [339] used NTP to add
Cl active sites on AC in the Cl
2 atmosphere, finding that AC treated

with NTP in the Cl
mercury removal efficiency among the four samples, with a stable
removal rate of higher than 96% in one hour (shown in Fig. 25 ).

that C –Cl groups were formed during the Cl

removal efficiency by AC and AC treated with oxygen NTP [337] .

Ce x O y  and  C –Cl  were  formed  on  the  CeCl
3 -impregnated  AC  sur-
face, which were beneficial active elements for Hg 0 removal. Shen
et al. [348] studied the effects of several loaded metal chlorides
and metal oxides on mercury adsorption of AC, finding that metal
chlorides showed better Hg g removal performance than metal ox-
ides loaded on AC. They concluded that metal chlorides loaded on
AC had both the catalytic effect of valance-variable metal and chlo-
rine oxidation for mercury capture.

Recently,  NTP  treatment  has been adopted  to  modify  the  AC,
which has the advantages of no chemical solution and time-saving
compared to the impregnation method. Zhang et al. [337] used the
oxygen  NTP  to  modify  AC  for  Hg 0  capture,  the  results  of  which
indicated that AC treated with oxygen NTP had a better Hg 0  re-
moval performance than that of raw AC, as shown in Fig. 24 . The
average Hg 0  removal rate by the oxygen-NTP-treated AC was al-
most 2-3-times higher than that of raw AC. It was suggested that
oxygen NTP treatment increased the ester groups (C –O), carbonyl
groups (C = O), and adsorption activate sites on the AC surface, all
of which were vital for Hg 0 adsorption. Hu et al. [338] compared
the modification effects of AC treated with NTP in different atmo-

6.3.5.2. Biochar.  To  economize  the  cost  of  mercury  removal  by
using  AC  or  modified  AC,  biochar  as  the  adsorbent  carrier  has
been developed by some researchers. The mainstream modification
method is halogen impregnation [349–356] . Zhu et al. [350] com-
pared  the  mercury  removal  performance  of  the  rice  husk  char
modified  with  HBr,  NH
4 OH  based
on same amount of bromine or ammonia, confirming that halogen
played an important role in mercury capture. Li et al. [352] used a
low-cost biochar pyrolyzed from municipal solid waste to capture
Hg 0 , which found that the biochar pyrolyzed at 600 °C had better
mercury removal effects than that at 400 °C. Both microwave acti-
4 Cl modification promoted Hg 0 capture by the sor-
vation and NH
bents, which decreased from 67% to 55% within the initial 100 min.
XPS results indicated that the Hg 0 removal mechanism was mainly
the conversion of Hg 0 to HgCl
2 with the help of C –Cl groups. Shen
et al. [353] illustrated that the biochar (derived from medicinal-
residue  pyrolysis)  impregnated  with  NH
4 Cl  showed  much  better
mercury  adsorption  performance  than  the  biochar  impregnated
2  and HCl. The chemisorption governed the overall Hg 0
with ZnCl
capture  process  for  the  chloride-impregnated  biochars.  For  the
biochar (derived from waste tea) modified with NH
4 Cl, the ultra-
sound impregnation process enhanced its Hg 0  removal efficiency
by  20–30%,  which  was  because  of  uniform  distribution  and  the
larger specific surface area. In addition, NO and SO

In summary, halogen modification can enhance the mercury re-
moval efficiency of the biochar, in which C-X (X: I, Br, Cl) and C = O
may act as the major chemisorption sites for Hg 0 adsorption. NO

6.3.5.3. Petroleum coke.  Petroleum coke is a low-priced carbon ob-
tained as a byproduct from the upgrading of bitumen or petroleum
refinement  [357,358] .  It  has  a  high-sulphur  content,  and  the
petroleum coke is usually dumped off as waste. Thus, some stud-
ies  propose  to  use  it  as  a  potential  mercury  sorbent  after  ac-
tivation  with  different  chemicals.  Lee  et  al.  [357]  applied  high-
temperature  pyrolysis  to  petroleum  coke  so  as  to  bring  sulfur
to its surface, which was believed to capture gas-phase mercury.
Their  result  showed  that  the  specific  surface  area  of  petroleum
coke increased by nearly 10 times and mercury capture was sig-
nificantly increased after pyrolysis. The pyrolyzed petroleum coke
was claimed to have high potential as a sorbent for mercury cap-
ture. Hong et al. [359] evaluated the mercury adsorption effects of
petroleum coke, modified by NH
4 Br solution, the results of which
showed that 1% NH
4 Br-impregnated petroleum coke could remove
almost all the mercury in a fixed bed within 120 min, and the mer-
cury removal rate was more than 90% in the entrained flow reac-
tor system with a temperature of 120 °C, residence time of 2 s, and
C/Hg ratio of 90,0 0 0. Their results highly supported that the mod-
ified high sulfur petroleum coke could be used as highly effective
mercury capture adsorbent for CFPPs. Cai and Jia [360] modified
petroleum coke with a KOH-SO
2 activation method and used it to
remove mercury from the aqueous phase.

The activation processes mentioned above are energy intensive,
costly, and produce harmful pollutants. In order to overcome these
issues, Xiao et al. [361,362] adopted a chemical-mechanical bromi-
nation method to modify the petroleum coke for Hg 0 capture from
flue gas. Their study showed that the mercury removal efficiency
of petroleum coke was improved by 60–70% after bromination, and
bromine and sulfur in petroleum coke enhanced mercury capture.
The chemical-mechanical bromination process created more active

mercury adsorption sites on the brominated petroleum cokes. The
inherent thiophene and organic sulfide in petroleum coke played a
major role in mercury removal. In addition, the leaching test re-
vealed  that  the  brominated  petroleum  coke  showed  a  negligible
leachability of bromine and mercury from the spent sorbent, which
was safe for disposal after its use.

Common features of carbon-based adsorbents modification are
to  obtain  more  mercury  adsorption  or  oxidation  active  sites  on
their  surface,  and  to  ensure  a  certain  degree  of  surface  physical
structure.  In  addition,  the  flue  gas  components, such  as  O
2 ,  NO,
2 , have a significant effect on the mercury removed by the
and SO
adsorbent.

6.3.6. Fly ash

2 , CaBr

Fly ash produced from CFPPs is considered to be a promising
sorbent for mercury capture [363] . The mercury removal efficien-
cies  of  fly  ash  are  affected  by  its  physical  and  chemical  proper-
ties, including fly ash particle size [135] , surface area and average
pore size [137,364] , UBC, and metal oxides in fly ash [137,157,168] .
To  improve  the  mercury  capture  rate,  fly  ash  is  usually  modi-
fied  by  halogens  or  metal  oxides.  Zhang  et  al.  [365]  compared
the  mercury  removal  effects  of  two  fly  ashes  impregnated  with
CaCl
2 , and HBr in an air-entrained-flow reactor, the results
of which showed that the HBr modified fly ashes had the great-
est  mercury  adsorption  ability  among  the  three  modifiers.  Both
the two fly ashes modified with HBr increased their mercury re-
moval efficiency from 8.1% and 3.4% to 98.4% and 59.8%, respec-
tively,  as  shown  in  Fig.  26 .  In  addition,  Zhang  et  al.  [366]  con-
firmed that HgCl
2 , HgS, and HgO were the main mercury species
2  and HgO were the major
on the unmodified fly ash while HgBr
mercury forms in the HBr modified fly ash after Hg 0 adsorption in
the entrained-flow reactor through the determination of mercury
compounds by using the TPD method. HBr was thought to be the
major factor for Hg 0 oxidation. Zhou et al. [367] studied the influ-
ence of flue gas components and ash composition on Hg 0 oxidation
or adsorption by NH
4 Br-FA), the results of
4 Br modified fly ash (NH
which indicated that NH
4 Br modification of the fly ash enhanced
Hg 0 oxidation and adsorption, improving the Hg 0 removal rate of
0–10% to 50% in 120 min. HgBr

control  mercury  emission  in  a  300  MW  CFPP  in  China.  The  re-
sults indicated that the modified fly ash could reduce 40–50% of
Hg 0 with no obvious change in oxidized mercury. With the com-

tion, the total mercury removal rate could reach 75–90%. Xu et al.
[369] indicated that fly ash modified with CaBr

possessed great mercury removal performance compared with the
raw sample, in which both the chlorine and Cu 2 +  and Fe 3 +  pro-
moted Hg 0 oxidation. Xu et al. [370] adopted a wet-impregnation
method to load cobalt on fly ash for Hg 0 removal and found that

efficiency to 76% in a laboratory fixed-bed reactor with O

It can be summarized that the modified fly ash can be used for
mercury removal, especially with halogen modification. However,
the mercury capture effects will be changed in a wide range due to
the complexity of the physical and chemical structure of the fly ash
surface from different power plants. In addition, the mixture of the
modified fly ash and original fly ash from CFPPs should be tested
for stability and leaching of mercury and halogens before using it,
for example, in cement kilns, when producing brick or tiles, and
when disposing off in landfills, etc. [371,372] .

with the Ca/Hg weight ratio as high as 30 0,0 0 0 [374] .

Li et al. [203] used the chemical impregnation method to de-

etate and mesoporous silica, the results of which indicated that the
sorbent could adsorb the Hg 2 +  completely under N

Ca(OH)

about 20%, 30%, and 37%, respectively. As the adsorbing time in-
creased,  the  Hg 0  capture  rate  decreased.  The  ultimate  Hg 0  ad-
sorption amount for the three Ca-based adsorbents was 0.74, 1.05,
and  1.30 mg/kg,  respectively.  The  mercury  adsorption  ability  of
Mn x + /Ca(OH)

In general, Ca-based sorbent is less effective in mercury cap-
ture even after activation, which is more beneficial for Hg 2 + cap-
ture than Hg 0 adsorption. The presence of SO

on mercury removal of the adsorbent.

clays  and  KBr-clays)  to  remove  Hg 0  in  simulated  flue  gas  atmo-
spheres,  the  results  of  which  indicated  that  KBr  and  KI  modifi-
cation  significantly  enhanced  Hg 0  removal  by  the  clays.  Increas-
ing KI or KBr loading and adsorption temperature had positive ef-
fects on Hg 0  removal. This was especially the case with the clay
loaded with 3 wt% KI as it had the highest Hg 0 removal efficiency
of  78–89%  in  N
2  atmosphere  during  the  3  h  of  adsorption,
whereas the unmodified clay almost captured no Hg 0 . The pres-

In brief, using the mineral as the mercury removal adsorbent
is mainly modified by the halogens. The chemisorption played an
important role in mercury adsorption by the modified adsorbent.

6.4. Novel mercury control approaches

6.4.1. Non-separable regenerable mercury removal adsorbent

Liu et al. [381] synthesized the natural chabazite-based silver
nanocomposite (AgMC) to remove mercury from coal-fired flue gas,
finding  that  the  mercury  could  be  captured  by  the  AgMC  com-
pletely when the reaction temperature reached up to 250 °C. The
nano-silver particles were confirmed to be the main active com-
ponent for mercury removal via the amalgamation mechanism. In
addition, the removed mercury in the spent AgMC could be eas-
ily  released  for  safe  disposal  and  the  sorbent  could  be  regener-
ated by heating at 400 °C. Rodríguez-Pérez et al. [382] developed
a regenerable sorbent by dispersing gold nano-particles on an AC
to  remove  the  mercury  in  flue  gas  after  desulfurization  units  in
CFPPs. It showed that the regenerable sorbent prepared by using
5% doped gold to disperse gold nanoparticles on a carbon material
could capture mercury effectively, and the mercury removal effi-
ciency could be 100% over several cycles of generation. The sorbent
could be regenerated by thermal treatment at about 240 °C, and
Hg 0 could be recovered and collected. The main mercury capture
mechanism was the mercury amalgamation with gold and oxidized
mercury retained by the AC.

with  NTP  showed  higher  mercury  removal  ability  than  raw  sor-
bents. The content of the high-valence manganese oxides and lat-
tice oxygen were increased greatly by the NTP, which was signifi-
cant for mercury removal. During mercury removal, high-valence
manganese  oxides  and  lattice  oxygen  were  consumed.  However,
the NTP treatment could supplement it, which increased the mer-
cury  removal  regeneration  performance  compared  to  that  with-
out NTP treatment. The mercury removal efficiency for FM-1 for
the first (without NTP treatment), third (with NTP treatment), and
fifth (with NTP treatment) was about 90%, 82%, and 75%, respec-

Thus, a combination of magnetic separation, thermal regeneration,
and plasma treatment can make FeMnO x  an excellent recyclable
sorbent  for  mercury  emission  control,  the  schematic  diagram  of
which is shown in Fig. 28 [385] .

Yang et al. [386] developed a new regenerable magnetic cata-
lyst by loading cobalt oxide on magnetospheres (Co-MF) from fly
ash and found that the catalyst could obtain about 95% Hg 0  re-
moval efficiency at 150 °C in a simulated flue gas atmosphere with
the optimal loading of 5.8% cobalt species. The repeated oxidation-
regeneration cycles illustrated that the spent Co-MF catalyst could
be regenerated effectively by thermal treatment at 400 °C for 2 h.

The magnetic adsorbent modified by metal oxides or the metal
halide  will  be  the  most  promising  sorbent  for  mercury  removal
from a coal-fired flue gas, which has the advantages of high mer-
cury removal efficiency, low investment, easy separation from fly
ash,  mercury  recovery,  etc.  However,  the  field  tests  of  applying
these adsorbents in CFPPs are sparse and the method needs fur-
ther study.

The development of a novel, efficient, multi-pollutant sorbent

pensive equipment and minimize the environmental impact. How-
ever, it is very difficult for the present multipollutant control tech-

nologies to realize the highest removal rate for the NO, SO

the equipment and the catalyst production costs should be com-
prehensively taken into consideration.

Finally, in order to provide more information about the mercury

organizations/institutes/groups in this field especially focusing on
mercury emission control have been listed in Table S3.

7. Conclusions

Mercury is a global pollutant with high toxicity, long-distance
transport,  persistence,  and  bioaccumulation  in  the  environment.
Coal  has  always  been  the  major  primary  energy  source  in  the
world, and it has been mainly utilized to generate electricity. CFPP
is the major anthropogenic mercury emission source to the atmo-
sphere, especially for China, India, and the US. Many countries have
issued stringent mercury emission limits for CFPPs.

With advantages of quickness, convenience, and high efficiency,
the thermal decomposition analytical method to determine mer-
cury content in coal has become more favorable than the chemi-

cal digestion analytical method. The mean mercury concentration
in the coal of China (0.20 mg/kg), the US (0.17 mg/kg), and South
Africa  (0.20 mg/kg)  is  higher  than  that  of  the  world  (0.1 mg/kg),
which  needs  more  attention.  Mercury  forms  in  coal  are  sulfide-
bound  mercury  (mainly  pyritic  mercury,  dominant),  clay-bound
mercury, and organic matter-bound mercury in general. Mercury
in coal is strongly correlated with sulfur content for most coals,
in  which  pyritic  mercury  is  the  typically  dominant  form  while
organic- and sulfide-bound mercury (mainly pyritic mercury) are
the  major  species  in  low-sulfur  coals.  In  addition,  the  existing
forms of mercury in coal are affected by many factors, including
diagenetic, coalification, and post-diagenetic conditions.

Mercury transformation during coal combustion can be divided
into homogeneous (without fly ash) and heterogeneous (with fly
ash)  reaction,  which  are  influenced  by  the  coal  types,  flue  gas
components,  flue  gas  temperature,  combustion  atmosphere,  coal
ash properties, etc. For the mercury homogeneous reaction, chlo-
rine benefits Hg 0 oxidation and the oxidation degree are affected

effects  of  NO  on  Hg 0  oxidation  have  not  reached  into  a  consis-

slight  enhancement. For  the  Hg 0  heterogeneous  reaction, fly  ash
with larger particle size is generally beneficial for mercury adsorp-
tion,  which  has  a  relationship  with  the  UBC  and  carbon  types.
The  mercury  heterogeneous  reaction  on  fly  ash  concerning  UBC
contains the physical adsorption and chemical reaction, in which
the physical adsorption is influenced by the particle size, surface
area, etc. that are positive with UBC. In addition, the active sites,
including  some  certain  unburned  carbon  forms  (anisotropic  car-
bon particles), oxygen function groups (C = O, OH/C –O, (O –C = O)–
O),  and  halogens,  etc.,  can  transform  Hg 0  (g)  into  adsorbed  and
gaseous Hg 2 + . The iron oxides in fly ash promote Hg 0  oxidation
and adsorption, which are influenced by the iron oxides type and
reaction temperature. The Hg 0 → FeHgCl(s) → HgCl
2  is thought to
be  the  main  route  for  Hg 0  oxidation  by  HCl  on  the  Fe

face. For different reaction temperatures, the Hg 0 removal mecha-

The generally used on-site mercury sampling methods, namely,
OHM,  US  EPA  Method  30B,  and  Hg-CEMS,  are  summarized,  in-
cluding the sampling or analysis principle, sampling requirements,
and the comparsion of their advantages and disadvantages. With
more and more strict limits on pollutants emitted from CFPPs, the
installation  share  of  APCDs,  which  include  SCR,  ESP,  FF,  WFGD,
and WSEP, increases. The APCDs have co-beneficial effects on mer-
cury besides the conventional pollutants, like NO x , PM, SO
2 , and
fine PM. The SCR equipment is good at Hg 0  oxidation with rate
of  6.5–79.9%,  affected  by  flue  gas  components,  boiler  load,  SCR
space  velocity,  SCR  catalyst  structure,  and  service  time  of  the
catalysts.  With  high  PM  removal  efficiency,  the  ESP  and  FF  spe-
cialize  in  Hg p  capture.  The  Hg t  removal  rate  of  ESP  and  FF  is
11.5–90.4% and 28.5–90%, respectively, influenced by the flue gas
temperature,  mercury  species  in  flue  gas,  fly  ash  components,
and  their  PM  capture  performance,  etc.  FF  exerts  a  higher  mer-
cury  removal  rate  than  ESP,  due  to  its  higher  PM  capture  abil-
ity. WFGD device has high co-removal performance for Hg 2 +  be-
cause of its high water-solubility. The Hg 2 + removal rate by WFGD
is 83.45–94.53%, with the Hg t  removal rate of 3.9–72%. However,
Hg 0  re-emission  may  also  occur  in  WFGD  process,  which  is  af-
fected by the operating temperature, pH, O
2 concentration in flue
gas, transitional metal ions concentration, etc. WESP can remove
32–40%,  72–82%,  and  33–100%  of  Hg 0 ,  Hg 2 + ,  and  Hg p ,  respec-
tively. The mercury transformation across SCR, ESP, FF, WFGD, and
WESP  is  also  reviewed.  ESP  seems  to  be  a  stronger  contributor
for Hg t removal by SCR + ESP + WFGD, followed by WFGD and SCR
device.  The  Hg t  removal  rate  for  ESP + WFGD,  SCR + ESP + WFGD,
SCR + ESP + FF + WFGD,  and  SCR + ESP + WFGD + WESP  is  35.5–84%,
43.8–94.9%,  58.78–73.32%,  and  56.59–89.07%,  respectively.  The
mercury emission concentration in the reviewed CFPPs of China,
South  Korea,  and  Poland,  the  Netherlands  and  the  US  is  0.29–
16.3 μg/m 3 . The MEF expressed as g/10 12 J for the CFPPs is 0.052–
12.06 (China), 0.046–12.50 (average 1.63, the US, bituminous coal),
0.198–4.565  (average  2.08,  the  US,  subbituminous  coal),  1.723–
24.04 (average 6.79, the US, lignite coal), and 0.71–6.09 (Poland).
Mercury  in  some  fly  ash  and  gypsum,  and  in  most  WFGD  and
WESP wastewater is higher than the relevant limits, and attention
needs to be given to whether they are processed further or dis-
posed off.

For the pre-combustion mercury removal, physical coal wash-
ing  technologies  can  obtain  0–65%  of  the  mercury  removal  rate,
which is mainly affected by coal types. However, it is difficult to
meet  mercury  removal  requirements  only  by  coal  washing.  The
mild  pyrolysis  method  can  remove  mercury  from  coal  to  a  cer-
tain  extent,  and  the  mercury  removal  performance  has  a  wide
range, influenced by the thermal treatment temperature, residence
time,  sweep  gas  flow  rate,  and  especially  the  mercury  forms  in
coal. For in-combustion mercury removal, the low-NO x combustion
technology and CFB combustion technology enhance mercury re-
moval. Compared to these methods, putting halogens into coal to
transform Hg 0 to Hg 2 + or Hg p has been widely studied to remove
mercury, which is a method that is simple to operate, highly effi-
cient, and low in cost. It can achieve a 60–96% mercury removal
rate with little addition of halogens in field tests. Post-combustion
mercury removal can be divided into three aspects. One aspect is
the  improvement  of  the  existing  APCDs,  such  as  enhancing  Hg 0
oxidation  by  the  SCR  catalyst,  which  can  be  improved  through
2 , Ce-Mn ox-
modifying the catalyst by metal oxides such as RuO
2 ; and suppressing Hg 0 re-emission in
ides, CeO
WFGD  by  adding  oxidants  or  special  chemical  reagents,  such  as
NaClO
4 , TMT15, Nalco-8034
reagent,  DTCR,  etc.  The  second  aspect  is  to  use  mercury  oxidiz-
ing catalysts and oxidizing chemicals to transform Hg 0 into Hg 2 +

3 , SCN- or S 2 − and HS −, Na

3 , and CaCl

and/or Hg p , including noble metal-based catalysts and non-noble
metal-based  catalysts,  hydrogen  halogens  (HF,  HCl,  HBr,  and  HI),
2 .  For  oxidizing  chemicals,  the  HBr  seems  to  be
ozone,  and  H
more effective for Hg 0 oxidation. The last aspect is to adopt mer-
cury removal adsorbents, including carbon-based adsorbents (AC,
biochar,  and  petroleum  coke),  fly  ash,  calcium-based  adsorbents,
and mineral adsorbents. To enhance Hg 0 removal efficiency by the
AC, halogens, sulfur, metal chlorides, and NTP treatment have been
adopted to modify the AC. Mercury removal performance by the
AC follows the decreasing order of AC < Cl-impregnated AC < Br-
impregnated AC < I-impregnated AC. Halogen modification can im-
prove mercury removal efficiency by the biochar, in which C-X and
C = O may be the major chemisorption sites for Hg 0 adsorption. The
chemical-mechanical bromination process  can  generate  more  ac-
tive mercury adsorption sites on the brominated petroleum cokes,
which benefits Hg 0 removal. The modified fly ash can be adopted
to capture Hg 0 , especially by using the halogen modification. The
complexity of the physical and chemical structure of the fly ash
surface from different power plants results in a wide mercury re-
moval rate. Moreover, the subsequent utilization or disposal of the
fly ash adsorbents in light of the stability and leaching of mercury
and halogens should be considered. Ca-based sorbents have little
effect on mercury removal even after activation, which have more
Hg 2 +  adsorption  ability  than  Hg 0 .  The  mineral  mercury  removal
adsorbent is mainly modified by the halogens, in which chemisorp-
tion plays an important role in mercury adsorption.

For the regenerable mercury removal adsorbent, the magnetic
adsorbent modified by metal oxides or the metal halide is the most
promising  sorbent  for  the  removal  of  mercury  in  coal-fired  flue
gas compared to the noble metal and conventional metal oxides,
which has advantages of high mercury removal efficiency, low in-
vestment, easy separation from fly ash, and mercury recovery, etc.
It is very difficult for the current multipollutant control technolo-
2 , and Hg 0 simulta-
gies to realize a higher removal rate for NO, SO
neously.

For  mercury  transformation  in  coal  combustion  process,  the
heterogeneous reaction mechanism among fly ash, flue gas com-
ponents, and mercury is complicated compared to the mercury ho-
mogenous reaction. However, the present published studies mainly
focus on effects of fly ash physical structure properties, unburned
3 on Hg 0 oxidation. The influence of flue gas com-
carbon, and Fe
ponents and the wide reaction temperature range on mercury ox-
idation  or  adsorption  by  fly  ash  is  rarely  studied  systematically,
which needs further attention. The mercury emission data for oxy-
coal combustion is not enough, especially the concentration and
distribution of various mercury species, mercury removal efficien-
cies by APCDs, etc. Many explanations for the effects of flue gas
components on mercury transformation in oxy-coal combustion at-
mosphere are only prediction, which has no credible evidence. The
models for mercury homogeneous and heterogeneous transforma-
tion under oxy-coal combustion conditions should be developed.

For mercury co-removal and emission in CFPPs, the following
aspects need further study, including developing a detailed mer-
cury transformation or removal mechanism across each APCD, es-
pecially SCR equipment; exploring the way to improve the Hg 0 ox-
idation rate in SCR equipment, or the removal efficiency of APCDs
and  their  combination;  obtaining  more  mercury  content  data  in
CBPs  and  giving  relevant  emission  limits;  and  determining  the
chemical species of mercury in fly ash and gypsum, which is im-
portant for their utilization or disposal.

For  mercury  removal  technologies  for  CFPPs,  further  studies
include  those  investigating  the  inhibition  of  Hg 0  re-emission  in
WFGD device by oxidants or special chemical reagents on pilot-

and full-scale tests with technically and economically feasible addi-
tives; exploring the deep mercury removal mechanism by putting
halogens into the coal; studying the stability and leaching of mer-
cury and halogens of commonly used carbon-based adsorbents and
fly ash for their following disposal; and conducting more field tests
applying regenerable mercury removal adsorbent, especially mag-
netic adsorbent modified by metal oxides or the metal halides in
CFPPs which are foreseen to evaluate their applicability.
