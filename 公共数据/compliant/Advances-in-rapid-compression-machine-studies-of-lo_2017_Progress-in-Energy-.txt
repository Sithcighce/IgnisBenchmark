Rapid compression machines (RCMs) are widely used to acquire experimental insights into fuel autoignition
and pollutant formation chemistry, especially at conditions relevant to current and future combustion tech-
nologies. RCM studies emphasize important experimental regimes, characterized by low- to intermediate-
temperatures (600(cid:1)1200 K) and moderate to high pressures (5(cid:1)80 bar). At these conditions, which are
directly relevant to modern combustion schemes including low temperature combustion (LTC) for internal
combustion engines and dry low emissions (DLE) for gas turbine engines, combustion chemistry exhibits
complex and experimentally challenging behaviors such as the chemistry attributed to cool flame behavior
and the negative temperature coefficient regime. Challenges for studying this regime include that experi-
mental observations can be more sensitive to coupled physical-chemical processes leading to phenomena
such as mixed deflagrative/autoignitive combustion. Experimental strategies which leverage the strengths
of RCMs have been developed in recent years to make RCMs particularly well suited for elucidating LTC and
DLE chemistry, as well as convolved physical-chemical processes.

Specifically, this work presents a review of experimental and computational efforts applying RCMs to
study autoignition phenomena, and the insights gained through these efforts. A brief history of RCM devel-
opment is presented towards the steady improvement in design, characterization, instrumentation and
data analysis. Novel experimental approaches and measurement techniques, coordinated with computa-
tional methods are described which have expanded the utility of RCMs beyond empirical studies of explo-
sion limits to increasingly detailed understanding of autoignition chemistry and the role of physical-
chemical interactions. Fundamental insight into the autoignition chemistry of specific fuels is described,
demonstrating the extent of knowledge of low-temperature chemistry derived from RCM studies, from sim-
ple hydrocarbons to multi-component blends and full-boiling range fuels. Emerging needs and further
opportunities are suggested, including investigations of under-explored fuels and the implementation of
increasingly higher fidelity diagnostics.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

POver the past few decades, research into the operation and per-
formance of internal combustion (IC), as well as gas turbine engines
has been undergoing a quiet revolution. These advances address the
need for both maintaining or increasing engine efficiency, currently
at a peak of 45(cid:1)50% for compression ignition engines and 60% for
combined cycle gas turbine engines, whilst decreasing emissions
beyond what is currently achievable with costly after treatment,
to values lower than 80 mg/km for nitric oxides (NOx) and below
5 mg/km for particulate matter (PM) (Euro 6) (19 mg/km NOx
and 1.9 g/km PM (U.S. Tier 3)), and below 0.67 and 0.03 mg/kWh for
NOx and PM, respectively, for stationary applications [1,2].

PHistorically, reciprocating IC engines have been divided into pre-
mixed, spark-ignited (SI) gasoline engines and diffusion-controlled,
compression-ignition (CI) diesel engines. However, the demand for
high efficiency, combined with ever lower emissions regulations has
led to a wide range of experimentation into autoignition-driven
combustion regimes using a variety of fuels and operating condi-
tions. The range of new operating modes aims to reach an optimum
balance between creating premixed operation, which both reduces
peak combustion temperatures, thus NOx and soot formation, while
maintaining ignitability for combustion phasing just after top dead
center (TDC), which increases thermal efficiency. The fine balance
must also maintain high enough exhaust temperatures to allow suf-
ficient oxidation of remaining unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs), car-
bon monoxide (CO) and PM or soot. The CI operating strategies
based on these concepts rely on modifying the injection, mixing and
exhaust gas concentration to modulate the autoignition and heat
release rate of the resulting globally fuel lean, fully- or partially-
mixed reactants.

PThe variations on a particular strategy of autoignition-driven
combustion are designated by the extent of premixing and mode of
exhaust gas recycling such as homogeneous charge compression
ignition (HCCI). A popular nomenclature from diesel studies has
been the idea of low temperature combustion (LTC) to differentiate
from flame-driven combustion. In this paper, we use the term LTC to
denote the class of autoignition-controlled, or chemical kinetically
modulated processes, where both volumetric autoignition and local

Pdeflagrative fronts can be present. Recent review papers have dis-
cussed potential opportunities and challenges to the application of
these techniques in engine operation [3(cid:1)5]. The opportunities arise
from the ability to increase compression ratios and burn very lean or
dilute mixtures, leading to high efficiencies and low emissions. A
simple energy analysis for an engine cycle with combustion at TDC,
i.e., the Otto cycle, shows that increasing compression ratios
increases the thermal efficiency of engines in proportion to
(1 ¡ CR1 ¡ g), where CR is the compression ratio and g is the ratio of
specific heats of the working fluid. Higher compression ratios and
higher specific heat ratios, which are obtained for more overall fuel
lean and/or more dilute mixtures, increase engine efficiency. Trends
are similar for gas turbine engines where pressure ratios and g dic-
tate efficiencies. Limitations come from two related processes. First,
since autoignition of the mixed reactants is inherently controlled by
chemical kinetics, some LTC operating strategies are challenged by
the inability to precisely control combustion timing via spark and/or
fuel injection events, particularly over a broad range of state and
mixture conditions. Instead, the combination of reaction and mix-
ing after a given fuel injection time modulates the start of combus-
tion. Second, the rate of heat release in kinetically-modulated
schemes is no longer completely controlled by flame propagation
or fuel injection rates, but by the often rapid reaction rates of
chemical processes distributed throughout the combustion cham-
ber. Finally, pollutant emissions depend greatly on the local equiva-
lence ratio and temperature-time history of the mixture. This
complex situation creates opportunities for low temperature, low
emission combustion, but in a scenario where many external and
internal parameters determine the local temperature and state of
mixedness, and ultimately reaction rates.

POriginal work by Onishi et al. [6] highlighted the possibilities of
premixed autoignition using internal exhaust gas recirculation
(EGR) in two-stroke engines. Najt and Foster [7] extended the work
to four-stroke engines, and highlighted limitations regarding con-
trol. The topic was reawakened by a series of papers by Johansson
and coworkers [8(cid:1)10], who demonstrated the ability to control the
process using a combination of injection control, variable super-
charging and EGR. Work in the U.S. and Japan demonstrated the use
of diesel fuel in HCCI mode [11(cid:1)15]. The latter work spawned a
number of studies on variations of HCCI, as discussed below.

Pon the subject since then, difficulties in controlling ignition of pre-
mixed charges remain. However, the original ideas have found
fertile ground in existing diesel engines in the form of LTC by
leveraging the recent advances in the ability to deliver multiple
injections in CI systems.

PThe concept of LTC was highlighted by Akihama et al. [16], who
neatly described the tradeoffs between soot and NOx formation in a
regime diagram (which has been highly cited since) showing calcu-
lated soot and NOx contours as a function of temperature, T, and
equivalence ratio, ’, for a given residence time. The diagram allowed
examination of desirable ’-T pathways that have the potential
to avoid the formation of either NOx or soot towards the low

Ptemperature regions, using either fuel rich or fuel lean strategies.
The diagram shows a narrow valley at combustion temperatures
which can attain low NOx and low PM. Following this idea, the con-
cept has been exploited in practice, and indeed adopted into practi-
cal engines via multiple injections, high EGR, and high boost
concepts, to name a few, such as the Toyota UNIBUS [17], or the Nis-
san MK [18] systems and extensively discussed in other review
articles [4]. In particular, very high efficiencies, low emissions have
been demonstrated by the use of low cetane fuels at intermediate
compression ratios between those typical of CI and SI engines
[19,20]. Further, dual fuel concepts such as reactivity controlled
compression ignition employ a combination of low and high cetane
fuels, delivered through separately timed injection events, to achieve
similar fuel economy and emissions performance. Numerous studies
have recently explored the very wide operating space including fuel,
engine parameters and operating conditions [21,22].

PThe need to understand and control autoignition has been
strongly motivated by a growing interest in HCCI and LTC concepts
in recent years. Additionally, parallel development in highly boosted,
downsized direct
injected, spark-ignited gasoline engines has
highlighted some limitations of the current autoignition database.
Downsized, boosted SI engines offer advantages in overall engine
size, weight, and fuel consumption, yet a byproduct of boosting has
been the onset of knock and especially random episodes of violent
autoignition [23,24], sometimes referred to as superknock. The ori-
gins of superknock are still under debate, but it appears to be associ-
ated with a mixed mode of combustion, in which an early local
deflagration or autoignition event (produced for example, by non-
uniformities in fuel-air ratio or the presence of easily ignitable lubri-
cants) leads to a sudden pressure wave across the chamber, which,
depending on the state of the gas and the turbulent dissipation of
the localized reaction, can trigger subsequent reactions throughout
the system, in a state approaching a developing detonation [25(cid:1)27].
PHigh pressures lead to high efficiencies in continuous thermal
cycles, so gas turbines have also offered targets for understanding
autoignition. Current gas turbines for power production typically
operate at pressure ratios between 15(cid:1)30, and aeroengine turbines
operate at pressure ratios around 40(cid:1)45 [28]. An overall higher pres-
sure ratio offers the highest efficiencies for a single stage, though
most stationary gas turbines optimize the efficiency of the overall
combined cycle, including multiple staged heat additions with a
range of mixing scenarios. Aeroengine turbines are designed based
on fuel properties of conventional kerosene and jet fuels, and are
typically not premixed, but rather fuel-lean, direct injection, where
the fuel and air are introduced shortly before the combustor to avoid
autoignition and instabilities. Aeroengines operate over a wide range
of pressures, temperatures and flow rates, and must guarantee oper-
ability over the entire operating map for safety reasons (cid:1) premixing
is thus limited, and uncontrolled autoignition must be avoided. Gas
turbines for power generation make extensive use of fuel-air premix-
ing with a variety of strategies, called dry low emissions (DLE), to
differentiate from other methods for lowering NOx such as steam-
injection or humid cycles. Gas turbines for engine cycles can also use
autoignition to stabilize the second heat addition in combined cycle
combustors, such as the sequential combustor of Alstom [29,30],
allowing for sufficient heat release rates under dilute conditions, but
with minimized NO production. Gas turbines must balance the pro-
pensity for autoignition, flashback and instabilities, whilst still being
operable for a variety of fuels, typically natural gas, with a wide
range of minor gas compositions (mainly H2 and higher hydrocar-
bons in methane, as highlighted in Section 6), but also synthesis
gases, biogases, and new synthetic and modified liquid fuels and bio-
fuels. Synthetic fuels vary widely in composition and corresponding
propensities for autoignition [31], so it is challenging to design pre-
mixed or direct injection systems that work well with a wide variety
of fuels using a fixed geometry. Fuel chemistry and interactions with

Pthe turbulent flows can influence burning rates and important com-
bustor parameters, such as the lean blowout limit [32,33]. Further-
more, low- and intermediate-temperature chemistry, and associated
heat release can perturb the flame structure, especially under com-
plex mixing scenarios used in modern gas turbine engines [34,35]. As
such, the availability of reliable, verified chemical kinetic mecha-
nisms for the pressures and temperatures prevalent in the premixing
(autoignition) zone of gas turbines (initial pressures up to 50 bar,
temperatures up to 1200 K) is essential to aid future turbine design.

PThe development of engines and fuels has followed largely sepa-
rate paths. Gasoline became available to replace coal gas in steam
engines, and diesel and kerosene were originally available as safe
alternatives to coal gas for street lamps at the time when Otto and
Diesel were testing their inventions [36]. Once the infrastructure for
fuel distribution was established engines adapted to the available fuels
rather than optimizing the fuels for the engines. In recent years, there
have been relatively large scale efforts to introduce infrastructure for
alternative fuels, particularly oxygenated fuels such as ethanol (in
Brazil and the U.S.), methanol (in Sweden), along with liquefied petro-
leum and natural gas conversions in various parts of the world. The
requirement for the success of new cycles or fuels however, has often
been that the fuels must use the existing infrastructure. Furthermore,
whereas some fuels such as ethanol may allow higher efficiencies
owing to higher octane ratings, these benefits are often not realized,
as in many markets the need to operate on a range of fuels restricts
the ability of engines to dynamically adapt to fuels. In Brazil for exam-
ple, most light duty vehicles are adapted by automakers to operate
using either 100% ethanol or a blend of ethanol and gasoline. In these
systems, the oxygen sensor varies the engine calibration according to
the fuel in use, but the overall vehicle fleet achieves largely sub-opti-
mal efficiencies using either fuel. If maximum fuel efficiency gains are
to be realized, along with associated reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions, a much more detailed understanding of autoignition associ-
ated with LTC processes of a wide range of fuels is needed to design
novel and robust engine hardware and operating strategies.

1.2. Measurements of autoignition phenomena

PThe ability to design and control reciprocating engines and
gas turbine engines that utilize highly promising LTC and DLE
approaches, along with new varieties of fuels, depends on the avail-
ability of well validated models for: (i) the chemical kinetics of the
autoigniting mixture, (ii) the rate of turbulent dissipation of species
and heat through the reaction process, and (iii) the interaction
between turbulence, thermal/compositional gradients, and chemis-
try. As mentioned, these needs are also relevant to modern SI and CI
engines that employ techniques such as downsizing and charge
boosting, since LTC phenomena including low- and intermediate-
temperature heat release (LTHR and ITHR, respectively) can become
evident as boost pressure becomes significant [37,38]. These issues
represent substantial challenges to the combustion community.
While models exist based on theory and interpretation of engine
data, experimental validation of proposed fundamental chemical
and physical mechanisms is still needed to cover the range of operat-
ing conditions found in engines, since unacceptable discrepancies
and uncertainties still persist in existing models.

P1.2.1. Autoignition chemistry

PA significant database for autoignition chemistry of various fuels
at engine-relevant conditions has been compiled ever since IC
engines have existed, where early interest targeted gasoline engine
knock, and to some extent diesel fuel autoignition. Recent efforts
have also targeted jet fuels. Chemical kinetic models are typically
formulated based on data from a variety of sources, including rapid
compression machines (RCMs) [39], motored or skip-fired engines
[40], flow/jet reactors [41,42], and shock tubes [43]. Typical ranges

Pthe ability to vary composition, pressure and temperature indepen-
dently, and the straightforward extraction of samples for chemical
analysis. Flow reactors can measure a limited range of ignition
times, based on location downstream of the inlet. Jet reactors must
be operated using very dilute conditions, e.g., <1% O2, to ensure tem-
perature homogeneity across a section.

PShock tubes offer the ability to reach the highest temperatures of
the techniques considered, e.g., 2500 K, by a combination of incident
and reflected shocks. Shock tubes are single shot devices that create
transient test conditions, so probing reactions is most amenable to
fast response optical and laser-based diagnostics, as physical
sampling can be challenging for the shorter test times available
(typically <5 ms), though a few techniques have been developed,
especially for very dilute mixtures [44,45]. Shock tubes are typically
designed with consideration for minimizing boundary layer influen-
ces on the gas dynamics, while some have been extended to lower
temperature operation and longer reaction times, e.g., 10(cid:1)50 ms
[43,46], by careful tailoring of the mixture used in the driver section,
and extension of the length of the driver section to minimize expan-
sion wave and contact surface interactions with the test gas mixture
(see [47] and references therein). A particular strength of shock
tube studies remains higher temperature dilute mixture conditions,
which are particularly well suited to studies of elementary chemical
reactions and can be more straightforward to model without consid-
ering complex boundary conditions [48].

PRCMs also offer well-controlled state conditions for studying the
ignition properties of fuels while using realistic (e.g., dilute to undi-
luted) mixtures. Like shock tubes, the single-shot character of RCMs
affects the nature of diagnostics used to access the state of reaction;
and, long test times of RCMs enable physical sampling and other
experimental techniques. Much historical and recent effort has been
undertaken to address challenges associated with RCMs, including
heat transfer induced boundary layer growth, as well as others. The
current work reviews many contributions of RCM studies to the
understanding LTC and DLE relevant autoignition chemistry.

P1.2.2. Physical-chemical interactions

PA significant database for physical-chemical interactions cover-
ing a range of engine-relevant conditions has been developed
through the use of steady flow / constant pressure devices like burn-
ers and rigs [49,50]. These configurations have the ability to generate
statistically stationary conditions (more so than motored engines)
and are able to provide wide diagnostic access for the implementa-
tion of optically-based configurations, as well as physical sampling
based ones. These steady flow devices are able to cover a wide range
of flow rates and power levels, but can be limited in, for instance,
pressure ratings. Achieving energy densities that replicate recipro-
cating and gas turbine engines is also challenging. Single-shot devi-
ces like combustion bombs [51,52] and spray chambers [53] have
also been used to achieve IC engine-relevant conditions, but the
diagnostic access is reduced, while shot-to-shot variability compli-
cates analysis of the data, and comparison with models. Some
datasets relevant to physical-chemical interactions have also been

tal devices and combustion engines.

Pof operation for these apparatuses are summarized in Fig. 1 and
Table 1; though some facilities operate outside of these ranges. Fig. 1
is presented to highlight the thermodynamic conditions of these
devices, but the reactor, as well as chemical time scale of the mix-
ture, which is discussed in Section 1.4, are also important.

PAll devices have intrinsic optimal ranges of temperatures and
pressures, limited either by physical material constraints or the
achievable reaction times of interest. Starting with reciprocating
engines, these were the original devices where autoignition was
detected and from which many historical studies originated. A
motored engine is typically a continuously reciprocating device,
without direct fuel injection or spark, which can produce repeated
compression events for the resident mixture inside the engine. The
bulk composition inside the chamber can potentially be controlled
by purging post-reaction gases over many cycles, i.e., skip-firing, so
as to produce well-controlled initial, bottom dead center conditions
on average. Given the character of the compression process, how-
ever, the mixture experiences the many processes typical of engine
flow, including heat transfer to the walls, and characteristic turbu-
lent disturbances produced by the inlet and outlet conditions with
moving valves. This means that whereas the bulk conditions in the
engine are statistically stationary, each single stroke experiences a
different detailed distribution of temperature and velocity, which
affects the chemical reaction rates. Thus, the statistical distribution
of autoignition times or critical compression ratios ascertained from
motored engines typically reflects the distribution of operating con-
ditions. One advantage of motored engines is that species evolution
can typically be obtained by timed sampling events relative to the
crankangle position, or by extraction from the exhaust gas flow.

PFlow and jet reactors attempt to separate the confluence of
mixing and reaction by providing very fast mixing conditions
throughout the system, so fluctuations of temperature or species
concentration across the volume of the reactor (in the case of a jet-
stirred reactor) or across the radial dimension (for plug flow reac-
tors) can be considered negligible. The challenge in this case is to
maintain the reactor at high and uniform temperature, as well as
high pressure. This is typically accomplished through external heat-
ing of the diluent gas and walls. An advantage of these reactors is

Pacquired via controlled-turbulence RCMs, and these unique contri-
butions are discussed here, with suggestions for possible future
work in this area.

PComputational databases for physical-chemical interaction stud-
ies are also growing covering the finest scales through direct numer-
ical simulation [54(cid:1)58], as well as larger scales via large eddy
simulation (LES) [59,60]. Extremely beneficial
insight has been
drawn, but the applicable Reynolds and Mach numbers, and other
regimes, e.g., Damk€ohler, can be limited.

1.3. Rapid compression machines

PRCMs have been used since the earliest days of engine research to
study autoignition phenomena, and a description of the evolution of
the hardware is presented in Section 2. These single-shot, piston-
based machines produce relatively fast compression of the gases in a
chamber, creating high pressure and temperature and nearly adia-
batic conditions. Modern RCMs are often designed so the test mix-
tures and conditions are decoupled from the fluid mechanics and
mixing that result from the gas exchange process in production
reciprocating engines, thereby allowing the study of autoignition at
conditions controlled by the design of the device. Importantly, the
boundary and initial conditions can be well specified. Moreover,
autoignition processes in RCMs are representative of those that
occur within combustion engines, where these evolve through many
thermo-chemical regimes, and this complicated evolution can be dif-
ferent than that experienced in temperature/pressure controlled
devices, as discussed, for example, in [61].

PRCMs have progressed significantly in design so that modern
configurations are able to create well-specified, thermo-chemical
state conditions within the reaction chamber which are well con-
trolled for long periods of time (2(cid:1)150 ms), and thus enable the
study of autoignition chemistry. Additionally, some arrangements
are also able to generate controlled non-uniformities for investiga-
tion of physical-chemical interactions, as highlighted in the previous
section. A variety of temporally- and spatially-resolved diagnostics
can be implemented to acquire a wide range of measurements
towards the development and validation of autoignition chemistry
and turbulence-chemistry interactions (TCI) models, as well as
understanding how full-boiling range fuels behave at engine rele-
vant conditions. Various diagnostic techniques are discussed in
detail in Section 3. There are currently nearly thirty laboratories
worldwide that utilize RCMs for investigations of gas-phase autoig-
nition processes. An overview of the physical characteristics and
capabilities of these facilities is provided in the Supplementary
Material. In addition, another fifteen laboratories employ RCMs to
investigate spray combustion phenomena [62]. The relative simplic-
ity, range of accessible pressure and temperature conditions and the
ability to tailor and control the reactant composition have allowed
data acquired from RCMs to reliably quantify the reactivity and reac-
tion pathways of a large range of fuels, as well as provide valuable
data for the development and validation of chemical kinetic mecha-
nisms. Recent reviews by K(cid:1)eromn(cid:3)es [63] and Sung and Curran [39]
describe state-of-the-art techniques for applying RCMs in this man-
ner. The current manuscript extends these works to additionally
cover utilization for studying physical-chemical interactions, as well
as detailed design considerations, diagnostic implementation and
insight, and alternative approaches to modeling RCM processes.

PEarly RCM studies primarily addressed high load (i.e. high energy
density), near stoichiometric conditions relevant to SI engine knock,
where trends in fuel reactivity at some select conditions were an ini-
tial focus. Substantial insights were contributed by a number of
groups, including Jost et al. at Philipps-Universit€at Marburg [64(cid:1)67],
Leary et al. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
[68,69], and Fish et al. at Shell Thornton [70(cid:1)73]. Griffiths et al. at
the University of Leeds [74(cid:1)78] and Minetti et al. at Universit(cid:1)e Lille

PSciences et Technologies (ULST) [79(cid:1)84] expanded upon these and
acquired more quantitative datasets utilizing sophisticated diagnos-
tics over a wider range of conditions. Recent developments in LTC
and DLE engines require extension of experimental databases cover-
ing an expansive range of pressures (p D 5(cid:1)100+ bar), temperatures
(T D 600(cid:1)1100 K), and dilution levels (O2 D 5(cid:1)30%), from very lean to
rich fuel loadings (’ D 0.25(cid:1)4.0), and a range of residual gas concen-
trations (EGR D 0(cid:1)60%), specifically to understand the role of CO2,
H2O, NOx and UHC present in dilution strategies. Hydrocarbon fuels
were the initial focus for RCM studies, while recent developments in
the fuel industry have prompted expansion beyond conventional
fuels, and into alternatives such as oxygenated structures. A sum-
mary of the results of RCM studies of natural gas, gasoline surrogates,
full-boiling range fuels and fuel additives is provided in Section 6.

PThe evolution of certain reaction systems is highly dependent on
the molecular structure of the fuel as well as the temperature- and
pressure-time histories. A well-studied example is the delayed auto-
ignition phase in long-chain hydrocarbons, whereby an increase in
temperature can lead to longer ignition times, and thus an apparent
“negative temperature coefficient” (NTC) region when ignition delay
time data are plotted using Arrhenius or inverse temperature coordi-
nates. This region, which appears around 700(cid:1)850 K for isooctane at
a pressure of 20 bar in air levels of dilution (i.e. 21% O2, mole basis),
is identified in Fig. 2 [62]. Under these conditions there is a shift in
the main reaction routes from the formation of hydroperoxides that
result from interactions between the fuel radicals and molecular
oxygen, and its associated LTHR which dominate at lower tempera-
tures, to the non-branching formation of stable olefins/ethers/car-
bonyls, accompanied by ITHR. The chemical kinetic processes, and
observed behavior depend on the temporal evolution of temperature
and pressure throughout the experimental tests, and thus can com-
plicate interpretations of the measurements, as well as comparisons
between different RCM, shock tube, and reciprocating engine data-
sets where different operating characteristics affect the state prepa-
ration and induction period. For example,
ignition delay time
measurements in the NTC region can vary by a factor of 1.6 (interde-
cile range) or more for hydrocarbons displaying this behavior, and
this can be seen in Fig. 2 [62]. The data presented here include
results from several RCM facilities in the 2nd International RCM
Workshop, and highlight the need for rigorous specification of the
initial and boundary conditions for each test, e.g., heat loss charac-
teristics. Furthermore, this illustrates challenges associated with
comparing experimental results when only on a single characteristic
parameter, such as compressed temperature is used as the basis.

PAll experimental devices are subject to operating constraints
which may limit the range of conditions available. For RCMs which
acquire data to quantify fuel reactivity, understand autoignition
chemistry, and investigate interactions between chemistry and the
scalar/velocity fields, particular attention needs to be given to the
measurement of local thermal conditions. As in all physical devices,
the state conditions can be affected by boundary layer growth and
gas motion, since different temperatures prevail near the walls rela-
tive to the center, or core of the test sections. As discussed earlier,
the onset of autoignition and rate of heat release can be altered,
intentionally (as in reciprocating engines) or unintentionally, by the
presence of inhomogeneities, mixing, and turbulence in the combus-
tion chamber. In many current RCMs, significant effort has been
directed towards suppressing undesirable non-uniformities; some
historical data indicate that when these non-uniformities are present
substantial scatter can result [69]. Strategies to address these are cov-
ered in Section 2. In order to achieve low uncertainties towards the
development of reliable chemical kinetic information and models,
and the formulation of more accurate phenomenological insight cou-
pled with quantitatively accurate simulations, comparisons of experi-
mental RCM data need to go beyond evaluation of ignition delay
times. Indeed, detailed evaluations require sound understanding of
the physical and chemical phenomena taking place within
the system and the influence of these on commonly measured,
pressure-time histories. These issues are clearly not unique to RCMs
(cid:1) boundary layer and turbulence-chemistry interactions appear in
other devices such as shock tubes and flow/jet reactors [86,87]. The
present review surveys different approaches to resolve these issues,
and identifies ‘best practices’ and opportunities.

1.4. Characteristic time scales

PAutoignition phenomena that occur within piston engines and gas
turbines can be substantially affected by states of mixing and turbu-
lence, and the developing chemical kinetics represents one compo-
nent of knowledge necessary to accurately predict ignition and heat
release in practical devices and thus facilitate engine design. How to
identify and model the onset of autoignition has been explored using
direct numerical simulations (DNS) [88,89], where the propagation of
autoignition events can be distinguished from deflagrative processes.
Experimental approaches for investigating coupled autoignition and
deflagration phenomena, as well as developing detonation phenom-
ena using RCMs are discussed in this review.

PCharacteristic time scales associated with LTC phenomena in
engines and RCMs, include: compression time, tC, reaction, or induc-
tion time, tR, molecular diffusion time, tD, and turbulent diffusion
time, tT. The compression time is determined by the driving force on
the piston and the stroke of the machine. For typical RCM studies of

Pautoignition chemistry the compression time is often designed to be
as low as possible to minimize overall heat transfer and extent of
reaction before the test conditions are reached, yet the velocity is
limited to the low Mach number limit, to keep acoustic disturbances
to a minimum. Furthermore, turbulence should be inhibited by
avoiding high strain rate conditions. The reaction time is a function
of the composition of the mixture and the local temperature and
pressure. A related quantity is associated with the rate at which the
local temperature (and pressure) rises due to chemical heat release,
relative to the reaction, or ignition delay time. The normalized sensi-
tivity of the rate of temperature rise is given by a modified Zeldovich
number Ze D tR/tu D (q/cv T)(E/RT) where tu is the characteristic time
of chemical heat release (sometimes referred to as an excitation
time [90]), q is the chemical energy released, cv the specific heat at
constant volume, while E and R are the activation energy and the gas
constant, respectively. When Ze is large, the local heat release can
for instance, gas
lead to large thermal gradients followed by,
dynamic or other phenomena, e.g., knock [91]. The molecular diffu-
sion time is a function of the diffusion of heat and species across the
mixture, which also depends on the pressure, temperature and mix-
ing conditions in the chamber. The turbulent diffusion time depends
on the turbulence characteristics in the system.

PThe ratios of the time scales, or Damk€ohler number, for uniform
composition systems indicate a wide range of possible behaviors as
proposed in Fig. 3, from fully uniform autoignition to ignition in
stratified layers. The behaviors change dynamically depending on the
initial condition or operating point. For typical RCM studies of autoig-
nition chemistry, the objective is to achieve laminar autoignition in
the adiabatic region, called the core, which ideally does not mix with
the cooler regions near walls. At the other extreme, machines can be
configured to achieve a well-mixed, non-adiabatic reactor regime, for
instance, to investigate turbulence-chemistry interactions.

PThe panel on the right in Fig. 3 compares time scales for laminar
and turbulent diffusion and reaction. At laminar conditions with high
rates of molecular diffusion, reaction can be quenched by heat trans-
fer. Low rates of turbulence and diffusion are ideal conditions for lam-
inar rapid compression machines with adiabatic conditions in the
core region. High rates of turbulence relative to reaction and laminar
diffusion lead to uniform stirred conditions, such as in a turbulent
engine at high speeds. For intermediate regimes, even if the system
starts at a uniform temperature, regions of cold gas can be intermixed
with higher temperature, autoigniting regions. The panel on the left
in Fig. 3 compares the rates of diffusion, temperature rise and reac-
tion. Cases where the rate of temperature rise is small or gradual and
the rate of diffusion is low, lead to adiabatic and steady conditions.
When diffusion rates are low and reaction rates are high, rapid heat
release can lead to detonation and knock (depending on the rate of
heat release and heat loss relative to the local speed of sound, which

Pis not considered in the present diagram). The NTC region significantly
complicates the characterization of the state of the system, as the rel-
ative rate of heat transfer and heat release can cause the temperature
to transition into or out of the NTC region. This can become a source
of scatter in autoignition measurements in the NTC region, as shown
by the data from different facilities in Fig. 2.

PFor the present discussion on the contributions of RCM studies to
understanding low and intermediate temperature chemistry, insight
into diffusion and heat transfer effects on reaction as well as heat
release rate at different experimental conditions is critical to deter-
mining the uncertainty and accuracy of RCM measurements. The rel-
ative importance of these physical and chemical mechanisms must
also guide experimental design and the appropriate modeling
approaches, as discussed in Sections 2 and 4.

1.5. Overview

PThe objective of this paper is to extend the recent reviews by
K(cid:1)eromn(cid:3)es [63], and Sung and Curran [39], and present a summary of
important advances that have been achieved via rapid compression
machines as experimental platforms towards improving the under-
standing, development and validation of models for low temperature
combustion. Thanks to both historical and recent innovations, uncer-
tainties associated with the reaction chemistry of the LTC regime have
been substantially reduced. Further improvements are still necessary
so that predictive capabilities can be achieved toward the design of
advanced combustion engines. The focus within this review is primar-
ily on gas phase phenomena covering autoignition chemistry and
associated physical(cid:1)chemical interactions. While spray combustion
has been investigated in RCMs, these studies are not reviewed here.
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the
evolution of machine configurations from simple, uncontrolled falling
weight devices to sophisticated apparatuses where the thermo-chemi-
cal/fluid dynamic fields can be precisely controlled during the test
period for studies focused on either autoignition chemistry or physi-
cal-chemical interactions. Section 3 covers the implementation of vari-
ous diagnostic techniques, both intrusive and non-intrusive, in order
to probe the evolution of the reactive system within the test chamber.
Section 4 further discusses autoignition regimes and associated model-
ing approaches where facility-specific effects can be taken into
account. Section 5 presents results of RCM investigations of physical-
chemical interactions, including effects of large- and small-scale phe-
nomena. Section 6 reviews advances made towards the under-
standing and modeling of autoignition chemistry for a wide
range of fuels, from hydrogen to gasoline and jet fuel. Finally,
current needs and opportunities for combustion research using
RCMs,
topics and the implementation of
emerging diagnostics, are highlighted in Section 7.

2. RCM designs and configurations

PRCMs have been employed since the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury to access thermo-physical conditions relevant to conventional
and advanced combustion schemes. These regimes cover the transi-
tion from low to intermediate-temperature autoignition phenom-
ena, including tight coupling between the scalar and velocity fields
so that mixed deflagrative-autoignitive processes can take place.
Continual progress has been achieved towards accurately specifying
the state of the mixture during and post compression, enabling
detailed investigations of the chemical transformations that occur
throughout the ignition delay period prior to the main explosion or
heat release, as well as interactions between the evolving scalar and
velocity distributions. These studies have provided unique insights
into LTC phenomena, while advancements in RCM design have
enabled the thermo-physical conditions of the reacting mixtures to

Pbe more precisely controlled, and facilitated the implementation of
advanced diagnostics.

PThe intent of this section is to review the progress and increasing
sophistication of RCM designs in order to highlight experimental
techniques which have provided access to important combustion
regimes. Challenges with the experiment and ways to address these
are also discussed. There are currently nearly thirty machines in use
worldwide to study LTC phenomena, generally emphasizing either
homogeneous autoignition chemistry or physical-chemical interac-
tions. This section segregates these two topics, and discusses geo-
metrical and operational needs of each, as well as means to address
these accordingly. The first part details progress in RCM design
towards achieving well-behaved conditions during and post-com-
pression for autoignition studies, as well as some characterization
results that have motivated the need for new technological concepts,
including manipulation of the piston trajectory, temperature and
mixture homogeneity. The second part of the chapter focuses on
recent RCM developments which, for example, seek to create non-
homogeneous conditions necessary to study turbulence-chemistry
interactions, and other phenomena. Improvements in RCM configu-
rations have been critical in reducing uncertainties associated with
the measurements as well as interpretations of acquired data, while
historical advances have provided guidance and insight into the
design and operation of modern and future machines. Important
findings are summarized at the end of the section.

2.1. RCMs for autoignition chemistry / fuel reactivity studies

PIn order to understand the autoignition behavior and reactivity
characteristics of fuel components, blends and full-boiling range
fuels, the capability to generate a wide range of temperatures and
pressures is required. RCMs have been developed to access relevant
combustion conditions without complications of flow and gas
exchange. However, the long experience with these devices has
shown that RCM design and operation must be undertaken with
care, as with all experimental facilities, to avoid adverse influence
on the measurements. Here, we specifically discuss challenges asso-
ciated with, and strategies to control: (i) the gas compression pro-
cess, (ii) piston creep and rebound, (iii) the state and uniformity of
the reacting gas, and (iv) piston crevice containment. Approaches to
interpret the data are covered in Section 4.

PFor studies of autoignition chemistry, ideally the volumetric
compression process would be instantaneous to eliminate pre-test
fuel reactivity and provide well-defined initial conditions, while
the chemical reactions during the constant volume process would
occur at conditions that are spatially uniform and without heat loss.
These characteristics are impossible to achieve in practice: as an
example,
instantaneous piston acceleration/deceleration necessi-
tates unwieldy mechanical forces, and generates compressibility
effects leading to complex gas dynamics, as well as the development
of turbulent, inhomogeneous conditions. Heat transfer must inevita-
bly take place, since the walls of the reaction chamber are, in gen-
eral, much cooler than the reacting gas, and heat loss therefore
occurs during the test period, decreasing the temperature and pres-
sure in the test chamber and stratifying the mixture.

PSince ideal operation cannot be achieved, all designs represent
some compromise. An optimal, but realistic configuration is one that
can compress the gas in a time short enough to decouple the chemi-
cal time scales from the piston motion, while simultaneously ensur-
ing that the arresting of the piston occurs smoothly and without
rebound, minimizing the generation of gas dynamics and turbulence
within the reaction chamber. Additionally, the configuration should
achieve a good degree of thermal and compositional uniformity
throughout the test gas by suppressing fluid motion within the reac-
tion chamber. The hot core gases in the center of the reaction cham-
ber should be segregated from the cold walls by minimizing the

Pthickness and volume of the boundary layer relative to the reacting
gas. Dead volumes associated with ports and diagnostics should be
as small as possible, while chemical contamination due to lubricants
or seal materials, or catalytic effects at the walls should be elimi-
nated. Furthermore, the reaction chamber should incorporate fast
sensors for measurement and control, and optical access or sampling
capabilities to enable implementation of advanced diagnostics. As
with all ignition studies the experimental results should be consis-
tent and repeatable. Finally, flexible configurations, e.g., clearance
height control, can facilitate convenient modification of the thermo-
dynamic state of the reacting mixture for each test. The following
sub-section describes some historical efforts undertaken towards
developing machines to achieve these goals, as well as modern tech-
niques. For the interested reader, comprehensive reviews of early
RCMs can be found in refs. [68,92].

P2.1.1. Early designs

PThe first RCMs were created in response to industrial safety con-
cerns. These were designed with the goal to measure ‘minimum
ignition temperatures,’ where it was expected that the autoignition
process would be instantaneous when these temperatures were
reached. The first known efforts in this direction were initiated by
Nernst and realized by Falk [93,94]. One of the RCMs used in their
work is pictured in Fig. 4(a).

PFalk's RCMs were actuated by a falling weight that drove the
compressing piston within the cylinder until autoignition occurred.
The pressure increase then drove the unconstrained piston back-
wards. The lowest position of the piston inside the cylinder was
recorded by a moving ring, allowing a calculation of the maximum
adiabatic compressed temperature. Seals made from hemp cord
were used and lanoline was employed as a lubricant to seal the com-
bustion chamber. In their studies using hydrogen, gas mixtures were
synthesized by electrolysis and introduced in the chamber through a

Ptube. The chamber was then sealed by moving the piston past the
injection port. Dixon and Crofts [95] used an improved version of
the Falk design that recorded the piston position history via a revolv-
ing drum, and used a tuning fork as a time reference. They identified
an influence of lanoline on the measured ignition temperatures and
raised concerns regarding the effects of particles on the experiments.
Visualization techniques were employed in order to provide insight
into these interactions with the autoignition process. Related issues
have been noted by subsequent researchers [96]. To enable photo-
graphic techniques, a pendulum RCM, equipped with a glass reaction
chamber, was used by Dixon et al. [97], as pictured in Fig. 4b).

PCassel et al. also used a falling weight apparatus [98], which was
equipped with lead washers and a brake in order to minimize
rebound issues at the end of the compression. The compression time
was reduced to around 40 ms, and the measured volume histories
were used to deduce experimental pressure profiles by supposing
adiabatic compression, as shown in Fig. 5. Both of these develop-
ments uncovered evidence of a time delay before autoignition was
observed. This first evidence of an ignition delay time agreed with
the contemporary visualization work of Dixon et al. [97]. These stud-
ies initiated interest in reducing the duration of the compression
phase duration in order to better decipher this period. This finding
opened new avenues for evaluating and characterizing fuels based
on induction time covering a range of conditions, and has resulted in
unique insights into fuel decomposition and oxidation chemistry,
such as the discovery of NTC behavior. This early RCM work also
led to the eventual use of shock tubes to explore reaction times at
conditions not achievable in RCMs, e.g., tR less than about 1 ms, and
temperatures greater than 1200 K [99(cid:1)101].

P2.1.2. Control of the compression phase

PThe volumetric compression phase, or state preparation period of
the experiment is critically important towards achieving a well-

Pdefined test and ensuring minimal reactivity before the test condi-
tions are reached. In terms of evaluating the compression phase
duration, a typical parameter, t50, can be used and defined as the
time for the last 50% of the pressure rise to occur. This parameter is
slightly shorter than the time required for the last 50% of the tem-
perature rise, t50T, due to the different non-linear behaviors of pres-
sure and temperature during isentropic compression. The t50 and
t50T times are useful since they provide an indication of the duration
that the mixture spends at elevated state conditions before the con-
stant-volume test conditions are reached. This can be particularly
important when very reactive mixtures are used and measured igni-
tion delays are short, e.g., <3 ms.

PFig. 6 illustrates three simulated piston trajectories and the asso-
ciated pressure and temperature histories for the reacting gas. The
piston travel is normalized based on the stroke of the machine and
an assumed compression time, while the gas pressures and tempera-
tures are calculated based on an assumption of isentropic compres-
sion of air with a fixed heat capacity where the initial temperature
and pressure are Ti D 300 K and pi D 1 bar, respectively. The stroke
and clearance height are kept constant between these cases with a
compression ratio CR D 12, while the velocity profiles are modified.

PCase 1 generates a fairly constant velocity profile during com-
pression where the acceleration and deceleration periods are con-
fined to the beginning and end of the piston stroke, respectively. In
Case 2, the piston is accelerated through most of its displacement
such that the velocity peaks after the piston has traveled 80% of the
stroke, near an instantaneous compression ratio of 4. The trajectory
used for Case 2 has been adjusted so that the stroke, compression
time and t50 are identical to Case 1; although these constraints are
not realistic for an actual configuration, they are used here for illus-
trative purposes. The resulting t50T for this configuration is about
twenty percent shorter than for Case 1, while the temperature-time
history indicates that the mixture is much cooler through most of
the piston travel. This characteristic could be beneficial for minimiz-
ing pre-reaction chemistry when investigating very reactive mix-
tures. On the other hand, the peak piston velocity is more than twice
that of Case 1, while the deceleration rate is 50% larger. These fea-
tures have implications with regards to the mechanical intricacies
and structural requirements needed to ensure safe and consistent
operation, as well as minimizing the generation of aerodynamic
heating and turbulence within the reaction chamber as discussed in
[102]. Furthermore, boundary layer growth, bulk fluid motion, tur-
bulence, and heat loss can also be affected by the piston trajectory in
complicated ways, but this is not discussed here.

PCase 3 uses a profile similar to Case 2, but the peak piston velocity
and deceleration rates are limited to the maximum values used in
Case 1. For the same stroke, this requires an extension of the overall
compression time to nearly twice that used with Case 2. This modifi-
cation, while addressing the concerns just mentioned, could have
undesirable influences on heat loss and the boundary layer growth
that occurs during compression, as discussed later in this section.
The resulting t50 and t50T times are nearly identical to those realized
by Case 1. In Cases 1 and 2, the final 50% of the temperature and
pressure rise are entirely contained within the deceleration period.
This highlights the fact that it is the deceleration and piston seating
processes that are the primary influences on these parameters, and
thus the state preparation period, and the mechanical design of the
arresting mechanism must be undertaken with care.

PThere are a number of methods that can be used to facilitate fast
piston acceleration and deceleration, as well as control the velocity
profile through the stroke. Pneumatics, hydraulics or explosive
charges can be used to drive the piston, while pneumatics, hydrau-
lics or impact mechanics can be used to arrest the piston motion.
Hydraulic shear and mechanical cams can be employed to modulate
the velocity of the piston through its displacement. Each approach
has challenges and limitations. The development and resulting
characteristics of some of the methods are discussed next in the con-
text of historical machine development, with an outlook to future
capabilities.

PPneumatic driving systems, which typically use compressed air as
the gas, provide a fast way to accelerate the piston, whereby a sepa-
rate driving piston can be employed on a shaft using an area ratio
force multiplier that allows lower gas pressures in the pneumatic
driving chamber. The ratio of the piston areas dictates the allowed
ratio of pressures between the driving chamber and the combustion
chamber, where the maximum pressure in the combustion chamber
is typically the maximum compressed pressure or the pressure at
ignition. While these limits are usually determined based on static
analyses of the design configuration, the dynamics of the piston
deceleration can be affected as the pressure limits are approached,
leading to extended t50 times. A separate, large air reservoir can be
used to maintain consistent pressure in the pneumatic chamber as
the piston is displaced. This principle was first put into practice for
the construction of several RCMs developed at MIT [103], but also
served in the development of the RCM later used by Jost et al.
[66,104,105], and is employed in many contemporary machines.

PTo achieve rapid pressurization of the driving chamber, Leary
et al. [68] employed a poppet valve that separated a high pressure

POther approaches to control the start of the experiment in pneu-
matically-driven systems include the use a diaphragm such as
employed in shock tubes [107], a globe valve [108] or a converging
nozzle geometry [109]. The rupturing of the diaphragm, opening of
the valve or unseating of the nozzle induces rapid pressurization of
the driving piston and therefore starts the compression process in a
controlled and rapid manner [107]. However, the compression phase
duration, and to a lesser extent the pressure at the end of compres-
sion, can be subject to variability in these designs, as reported in
Shiga et al. [110].

PThe use of a hydraulic driving system is one way to reduce the
required piston area ratio for a device, since much higher hydraulic
pressures can be safely employed (e.g., »40 MPa compared to
2(cid:1)4 MPa for pneumatic systems) [111]. In addition, the initial and
final piston positions and the piston trajectory can be controlled
with fairly good precision. However, significant amounts of hydrau-
lic fluid must be transported into the driving chamber as the piston
is displaced in order to maintain the driving pressure. The timing
and capacity of the servo valves and hydraulic accumulators used to
actuate and control this can therefore influence performance. As a
result, slower compression times have generally been reported for
hydraulically-driven machines, e.g., 40(cid:1)60 ms [112,113].

PIn an effort to reduce the mechanical complexity and time
required to replace pins or diaphragms on pneumatic driving sys-
tems, other configurations have been devised. The RCM designed at
Shell Thornton by Affleck et al. [114], and now in use at the National
University of Ireland Galway [115] was configured with a hydraulic
section between the pneumatic and reaction chambers where this
can be used to lock the piston in place before compression and
achieve controlled, consistent actuation. Hydraulic fluid in front of an
integrated hydraulic piston, shown in Fig. 8, is pressurized to a level
that prevents the piston from moving at the retracted position, even
after the high pneumatic pressure is applied to the driving piston.
The retracted location is indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 8, while
the pressure on the opposite side of the hydraulic piston is kept near
atmospheric levels. The discharge of a small volume of the fluid from
the main chamber (i.e., in front of the piston) provides proper actu-
ation of the experiment as this causes the hydraulic pressure differ-
ential to disappear, and the piston subsequently moves. The timing
of depressurization of the main chamber can be used to synchronize
the motion of the two pistons for this opposed-piston geometry.

PThe hydraulic section in the Shell Thornton machine was care-
fully designed to modulate the piston velocity through the stroke.
This was inspired by novel braking configurations developed by
Rogowski at MIT [116], and Voinov et al. at the Institute of Chemical
Physics, USSR [117]. The large inner bore of the chamber at the
retracted location allows the piston to accelerate freely at the start
of the test with little hydraulic resistance. Partway through the
stroke, the bore of the chamber narrows so that when the piston
enters this section there is substantial hydraulic shear on the cir-
cumference of the piston, as well as pressurization of the fluid in
front of the piston. The gap between the piston circumference and
the inner bore was sized so the resulting hydraulic forces balance
the pneumatic driving force and this causes the velocity of the piston
to become nearly constant through the main portion of the stroke,
similar to the profile seen for Case 1 in Fig. 6a. Fast compression
times were also achieved with this machine due to its opposed-
piston configuration and short stroke for each piston, with
tC (cid:3) 13 ms, and t50 (cid:3) 1.5 ms. The robust design enabled the Shell
group to acquire a range of ignition and speciation data covering
cool flame/two-stage ignition chemistry [70(cid:1)73]. The machine at
the University of Leeds [118] is of nearly identical design and utilizes
this hydraulic chamber arrangement, though only one piston is
employed in order to facilitate a range of optical diagnostics in the
end wall of the reaction chamber, as discussed further in the next
section of this review.

Psection from a lower pressure section in the driving chamber, as
shown in Fig. 7. The poppet valve was raised with a screw jack, and
held in place by shear pins. A falling weight would break the pins
and allow compressed air to enter the lower section of the chamber.
The lowest section of this chamber, at first filled by a lower pressure
of air, was compressed by the piston and served as an air cushion
with the purpose to slow the compression piston and avoid mechan-
ical shock. Meticulous adjustment of the air pressures was needed.
This RCM was able to reach compression times as fast as tC D 6 ms,
with t50 around 1 ms, owing to its very short stroke (»9 cm). These
times are still fast by today's standards. The peak piston velocity was
near 20 m/s. A strain gage was used as a pressure sensor and the
piston position was evaluated from high speed photographs of the
piston relative to position references of equally spaced black and
white lines. The data from this machine, however, suffered from
reproducibility issues, and under certain conditions, pressure ringing
at ignition. The inconsistencies would be attributed in later work
to temperature inhomogeneities within the reaction chamber, as
observed in direct photographs and schlieren images [69,106]. Inho-
mogeneities most likely originated from the vigorous compression
process and the concave geometries of the piston and cylinder head,
which led to undesirable fluid motion and turbulence within the
reaction chamber. Nevertheless, data from this device enabled
early insight into the chemical kinetic effects of knock inhibitors
such as tetraethyl lead as well as features of mild ignition, which is
associated with convolved deflagrative/autoignitive processes, for a
variety of fuels, and these are discussed in more detail in Sections 5
and 6.

PFollowing this idea, the machine at the Universit(cid:1)e Pierre et Marie
Curie (UPMC) was designed to utilize dynamic control of various
hydraulic servo valves to regulate the hydraulic pressure in front of
the piston during the stroke and thus achieve similar constant-
velocity piston trajectories [113]. This was only possible however at
longer compression times, tC > 40 ms, with maximum velocities
around 5 m/s, due to servo valve limitations.

PAnother means to control the piston trajectory is the use of cou-
pled mechanical parts, as first demonstrated in Tizard and Pye's

PRCM, developed by Ricardo [119]. This machine employed a fly-
wheel-driven crank that brought the piston to TDC in approximately
120 ms before disconnecting, leaving it locked in that position. More
recent developments have yielded the construction of a number of
right-angled RCMs [120(cid:1)124], such as the one presented in Fig. 9.
These devices employ a moving cam to couple the motion of the
driving piston with the motion of the compressing piston, where the
advantage is precise control over the piston velocity and compres-
sion ratio, although relatively longer compression times typically

Presult (tC > 30 ms). With an arrangement of this type, a range of
piston trajectories can be easily prescribed by utilizing different
cam profiles [125,126]. Before compression, the driving piston is
usually kept in place by a hydraulic jack while the driving chamber
is pressurized.

PAs discussed earlier, the deceleration phase of the piston is criti-
cal towards ensuring short t50 and t50T times. One successful method
to achieve rapid stoppage of the piston without significant gas oscil-
lations is to use impact mechanics, where the momentum of the pis-
ton is transferred to another component of the machine upon
impact, as was originally done by Jost et al. [66,105] at Philipps-Uni-
versit€at Marburg, and as currently employed at the University of
Michigan [108], Nihon University [127] and the University of Cape
Town [128]. Final t50 times on the order of 0.5(cid:1)1.5 ms are possible
with this approach. Jost's RCM used an elastic shock between the
vertical, pneumatically driven piston and a floating buffer mass on
springs, as shown in Fig. 10a, to achieve high deceleration rates. The
masses of the shock damping system and of the piston were similar,
so the piston would come to rest nearly instantaneously, while the
floating mass was displaced further. This RCM was most likely the
first to be equipped with a piezoelectric pressure sensor since the
issue of mechanical vibration at piston arrest was successfully
resolved, and test times of several tens of milliseconds allowed Jost's
group to build a wide and comprehensive understanding of the igni-
tion of C4(cid:1)C8 alkanes. They reported data on two-stage ignition,
effects of temperature, pressure, ’ and of alkyl chain length on the
ignition delays, as well as evidence of NTC behavior for some fuels.
The effects of tetraethyl lead as an octane booster for gasoline surro-
gates were also investigated, as highlighted in Fig. 10b-d. Their inter-
pretation of the data suggested that while the first stage of ignition
was due to chemical branching, the second stage was made possible
because of thermal runaway. These findings provided early founda-
tional support towards the current understanding of causes for two-

Pstage ignition: indirect chemical branching through the formation of
unstable peroxides leading to LTHR, and thermal decomposition of
H2O2 accumulated from H-atom abstraction reactions involving HO2
for the second stage, as discussed more thoroughly in Section 6. Fur-
thermore, by studying the LTHR during autognition of n-heptane/air
mixtures with tetraethyl lead addition, the additive was found to be
effective only when the reaction temperature was high enough to
facilitate its decomposition and subsequent radical scavenging, so
that the second-stage ignition times were extended, while the first-
stage ones were typically unaffected.

PIkegami et al. [130] and later Donovan et al. [108] developed con-
figurations that used tapered pistons made of deformable material,
e.g., ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, to absorb the kinetic
energy of the piston. These arrangements also seal the reaction
chamber during the test period. Schmidt et al. [131] and Watanabe
et al. [127] employed buckling of calibrated aluminum tubes to
decelerate the piston. In principle, it was possible to vary the stroke
by adjusting the thickness of the tubes. Both of these concepts
required disassembly of the machine between tests in order to
unseat the piston or replace the shock absorbing tubes. To minimize
the interval between tests, Evezard [128] developed a hydraulically-
coupled momentum trap to decelerate the piston. Careful adjust-
ment of the distance between the momentum trap position before
the impact and the final resting place of the impacting end was
needed, but this design, along with its two-stage pneumatic driving
system, yields piston velocities as high as 8 m/s just before the end
of compression. Because of the unique configuration of the coupled
momentum trap, the combustion chamber in this RCM has a toroidal
geometry.

PAn alternative method to achieve fairly rapid, though somewhat
slower piston deceleration is based on hydraulic oil displacement. In
this concept a ring-groove [114], or similar geometry [102,116], is
used within the hydraulic chamber wherein oil must be displaced as

Pthe ring, located on the fore side of the hydraulic piston, enters a
stopping groove near the end of the piston stroke, as depicted in
Fig. 8. Compression of oil within the groove increases the pressure
quickly and this resistive force slows the piston's motion, while the
oil seeps from the groove back into the main hydraulic chamber.
Careful adjustment of the ring-groove clearances, and any additional
transfer ports, e.g., radially through the ring, is needed to achieve
precise control of the deceleration profile [132]. Numerous machines
currently in use employ this technique.

PFinally, controlled piston deceleration can also be achieved via a
prescribed cam profile or modulation of servo valves within hydrau-
lically driven configurations, as highlighted previously. Deceleration
rates can be limited due to the allowable stresses on the roller bear-
ings or in the connecting rod of the cam design, and the piston
motion is often damped using a shock absorber or a hydraulic brake.
Servo valve limitations can lead to fairly long deceleration rates, e.g.,
t50 (cid:3) 6.5 ms.

P2.1.3. Control of piston creep and rebound

PIt is possible for piston creep and/or rebound to occur during the
piston seating process, with rebound also possible during chemical
heat release. Creep is defined as slow movement of the piston in the
compressive direction, while rebound is defined as movement in the
expansive direction. Following the work of Cassel et al. [98], it was
identified that slight changes in the volume of the reaction chamber
at TDC can significantly alter the gas temperature, and therefore
lead to tremendous changes in the global reaction rate of the mix-
ture. It is thus crucial to ensure the volume of the chamber is well
controlled, at least for the duration of the ignition delay, or longer if
analyses are conducted through the main ignition process, e.g., rate
of heat release measurements. Hydraulically damped systems are
more prone to creep and rebound during piston seating due to the
dynamics of the oil displacement process and this needs to be con-
sidered in the design. Creep has however been proposed as a way to
counteract the influence of heat loss however, with the intent to
reduce the rate of pressure fall-off that can occur in the early portion
of the ignition delay period [133]. This does not prevent the growth
of the thermal boundary layer in the reaction chamber, but simply
maintains the elevated pressure and temperature of the core gases
for a slightly longer period of time, e.g., 10(cid:1)15 ms.

PAt the end of compression, the piston can be locked in its TDC
position by a combination of mechanical elements or driving pres-
sure, in such a manner that eventual heat release does not push the
piston back. The most frequently used solution in linear RCMs is to
impose a higher pneumatic force on the driving piston than the force
resulting on the combustion chamber piston, so the compression
piston is not displaced by the heat release. A very large bore driving
piston, or large driving pressure can be required in order to ensure
the absence of piston rebound. This can be challenging when high
compressed pressures are used, e.g., pc > 30 bar, since the reaction
chamber pressure can alter the piston dynamics during the decelera-
tion process, as well as at the point of heat release.

PHydraulically-assisted schemes have been used in hydraulically
decelerated machines wherein the main hydraulic chamber is main-
tained in a pressurized state during the actuation process while the
pressure in the groove at the endwall is reduced after piston seating,
e.g., via connection to a low pressure reservoir, [134]. Additionally, a
variety of mechanical solutions have been used, starting with the
clamping mechanism first demonstrated in Aubert and Pignot's RCM
[135]. Two pins mounted on springs were engaged in corresponding
holes on the compression piston axis and held in place at TDC. The
disadvantage of this system is of course its relative fragility and
ensuing limitation in terms of maximum pressure obtained while
the ignition takes place, as well as the possibility to induce piston
creep at the final stages of compression.

PTizard and Pye's RCM [119] and its flywheel-controlled compres-
sion phase also offered an early solution to this problem, with the
compromise of a longer compression phase. In a similar fashion,
some in-line RCMs are currently equipped with hinged arms, i.e.,
two-bar linkages, that keep the piston in place at TDC [136,137]. Kim
et al. [138] used a system of gears to connect the movement of the
driving piston and of the compression piston, which allows easy var-
iation of the compression ratio. Right-angled RCMs also keep the
combustion chamber volume rigorously constant after compression,
as a result of the mechanical linkage between the driving piston and
the compression piston.

P2.1.4. Control of the reacting gas

PThe autoignition behavior of the reacting mixture is critically
dependent on the gas temperature. To minimize uncertainties asso-
ciated with the experiment and understanding derived from the
measurements, the thermodynamic state of the gas must be accu-
rately determined, including any non-uniformities in the reaction
chamber. Temperature can be measured directly in RCM studies, as
discussed in Section 3, but this is difficult and under some conditions
the uncertainties are high, and thus most often temperature is
inferred from other direct measurements like pressure. The first
RCM studies considered the compression process to be fully adia-
batic with homogeneous conditions in the reaction chamber, i.e.,
isentropic; it was assumed compression was sufficiently rapid that
heat losses and non-uniformities were negligible. The temperature
obtained after compression was calculated based on the geometric
compression ratio with this hypothesis in mind. Nevertheless, meas-
urements by Tizard and Pye [139] proved this assumption to be
wrong. In their tests, the compression time was varied between tC
D 50 and 200 ms, and the measured pressure at the end of compres-
sion was compared with the calculated adiabatic pressure. These
data are shown in Fig. 11. Here the pressure at maximum compres-
sion, pc, is plotted as a function of overall compression time, with
the instantaneous, adiabatic values marked by extrapolation to zero
compression time, determined using a fixed specific heat ratio, g, for
the mixture. The results show how increasing compression times
leads to pressures lower than adiabatic, which is attributed to heat
transfer during compression.

adiabatic pressure (labeled as t D 0, no heat loss) as a function of the compression

the behavior of a flat piston geometry (reprinted from [39] with permission of Elsevier).

PTizard and Pye [139]

further highlighted the competition
between reaction rates and rates of gas cooling during the ignition
delay period covering a number of different fuels, including n-hep-
tane, diethyl ether and carbon disulphide. They explored differences
between ‘quiescent’ conditions and cases where an internal fan
was used to stir the gases in the reaction chamber, and they noted
shifts in measured ignition times as well as quenching limits for the
tests. Leary and co-workers [69,106] were one of the first groups to
identify, based on schlieren and direct imaging, the possibility of
generating non-uniformities within the reaction chamber during
compression due to piston-wall interactions, as the boundary layer
can be scraped from the wall to produce turbulent gas motion. Park
and Keck [102], using insight derived from IC engines studies, fur-
ther described the development of flows at the piston-wall interface,
where it is possible to generate a toroidal structure during compres-
sion. Griffiths et al. [140] were then one of the first groups to employ
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to better understand interac-
tions between large-scale thermal non-uniformities and the prog-
ress of autoignition. Their calculations, while coarse in terms of
spatial resolution and chemistry (e.g., 14 £ 50 cells with 30 species
participating in 70 reactions representing ditertbutyl peroxide
(DTBP) mixtures), highlighted boundary layer effects and the evolu-
tion of the corner vortex. The work by Griffiths et al. [140] showed
that reactivity can develop faster in cooler rather than hotter regions
of the reaction chamber for fuels with NTC behavior, though this is
dependent on the compressed conditions, as well as fuel loading.
Similar observations of induced non-uniformities and their influence
on the autoignition chemistry were subsequently described in fur-
ther multi-dimensional simulation studies conducted by Lee and
Hochgreb [141], Gu(cid:1)ezet and Kageyama [121], Chen and Karim [142],
and Frolov et al. [143]. Experimental measurements, based on Ray-
leigh scattering [144] and microthermocouples [145], confirmed the
development of toroidal structures, which were observed to persist
well into the ignition delay period under some conditions, e.g., for
longer than 50 ms. The results from studies such as these motivated
research towards improving the homogeneity of the test gases for
experiments focused on autoignition chemistry.

PWhen designing their RCM, Park and Keck [102] made several
recommendations to mitigate the detrimental behavior of gas
motion in the reaction chamber and the ensuing development of
temperature non-uniformities. Their scaling analyses indicated that
the Reynolds number, Re, based on stroke and mean piston speed,
should be less than about 105 in order to keep the boundary layer
laminar, while the Mach number of the piston should be less than
0.08 to avoid significant heating of the gases by sound waves gener-
ated by the piston. For their configuration, these constraints resulted
in piston velocity limits of 10 and 20 m/s, respectively. Their remain-
ing recommendations aimed to reduce the mixing of the boundary
layer with the central core gases. Firstly, they proposed a criterion
for the minimum ratio of the bore to height of the chamber, which
should be greater than 5. Consequently, the bore would exceed the

Pvortex diameter by at least tenfold, so as to minimize the extent of
vortex influence on the temperature field. Secondly, they proposed
implementing a crevice volume machined around the circumference
of the piston that could capture the thermal boundary layer which
develops along the cylinder walls during the compression phase,
and thereby prevent the vortex formation and subsequent mixing
with the core gases. This concept can be seen in Fig. 12, where
the core and boundary layer gases are shown schematically for a
creviced and an uncreviced, or flat piston.

PPark and Keck's piston crevice design (highlighted in Fig. 13, col-
umn (a)) was improved further by Lee and Hochgreb on the same
RCM [141], where a different geometry was suggested, with the fol-
lowing points in mind: (i) the clearance between the piston crown
and the wall should be larger than the boundary layer but small
enough to limit reemergence of the crevice contents back into the
reaction chamber during the delay period, (ii) the crevice should
have a shape able to quickly cool the captured boundary layer gases
to a temperature where reactivity can be considered negligible, and
(iii) the crevice volume should be large enough to contain the corre-
sponding volume of boundary layer gases. The improved configura-
tion is identified in column (b) of Fig. 13.

PThe effectiveness of this strategy was demonstrated by follow-on
detailed CFD studies [146,148], using higher spatial resolution and
improved physical sub-models resolving down to a 0.1 mm cell
thickness in the boundary layer, corresponding to 9000 cells at the
end of compression. The associated crevice geometries are presented
in columns (c) and (d) of Fig. 13, respectively. W€urmel and Simmie
[146] suggested that the dimension of the entrance of the crevice
may not play a significant role, once it is larger than a value sufficient
to capture the thickness of the boundary layer. They found that dilu-
ent gasses with different heat transfer properties could significantly
alter the boundary layer growth during piston compression, and
thus the effectiveness of the crevice. The size of successful crevice
volumes were around 12(cid:1)14% for the RCM system used by W€urmel
and Simmie [146], and 9(cid:1)13% for the RCM system used by Mittal

Pand Sung [147], relative to the compressed reaction chamber volume.
The capability of these crevices to reduce the vortex formation was
observed in the computational results, and confirmed experimentally
using acetone planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) thermometry
[148]. More recommendations on the crevice design and limitations
for vortex formation were provided based on additional CFD calcula-
tions in Mittal et al. [149], who noted that a longer stroke can result
in a larger vortex, while a wider clearance at the end of compression
could mitigate the influence of the vortex. This last finding is contra-
dictory with the recommendations of Park and Keck [102], though
the investigated geometries were slightly different. Large bore-to-
height ratios proposed in [102] generally lead to higher surface area
to volume ratios, and therefore greater heat loss and thermal stratifi-
cation under long test time conditions. In any event, producing crevi-
ces large enough to trap the entire thermal boundary layer during
compression can be challenging for experiments that utilize mixtures
with high thermal diffusivities, such as under low pressure conditions
(pc (cid:3) 5(cid:1)8 bar), as the thermal diffusivity is inversely proportional to
pressure. Mittal et al. [149], summarized the influence of the corner
vortex for a range of pressures and strokes, and this is depicted in
Fig. 14.

PFrom these studies, it is clear that properly configuring the piston
crevice for particular machine geometry and operating conditions is
key to adequately suppressing the corner vortex formation, and that
a single configuration may not be appropriate across a wide range of
facilities, or a range of experimental conditions explored during an
experimental campaign. Yousefian et al. [150] used non-dimensional
scaling to highlight that Peclet number, bore: stroke aspect ratio, and
crevice volume: swept volume ratio are key overall parameters
towards suppressing fluid motion and minimizing thermal non-
uniformities. Care must be taken in the crevice design and imple-
mentation to ensure that flow stratification, heat transfer and
boundary layer effects are minimized for a particular test series.

P2.1.5. Piston crevice containment

PThe development of creviced piston configurations has been a
significant advancement in the design of RCMs towards studying
autoignition chemistry and fuel reactivity, and has substantially
improved the quality of data recorded and reduced uncertainties in
Improved piston designs have
datasets from these machines.
enabled better descriptions of the gas mixture during and post com-
pression via the adiabatic core model which is presented and dis-
cussed in Section 4. For many reactive systems this approximation is
sufficiently accurate, as long as the thermal boundary layer repre-
sents only a small portion of the reaction chamber volume, isolated
at the walls of the chamber. There are many ways to conduct chemi-
cal kinetic simulations using this hypothesis which are reviewed in
Section 4. A particularly popular method employs a zero-dimen-
sional framework with a time-varying volume derived from pressure
records using non-reactive experiments. It has been demonstrated

Pthat during multi-stage ignition however, and even under slightly
exothermic conditions, e.g., ITHR, mass flow from the main reaction
chamber volume to the crevice can be significant, and can affect
observed ignition delay times [85,151]. These processes are not
taken into account in most adiabatic core simulation frameworks
[152]. In addition, creviced geometries can lead to uncertainties
associated with the gas composition when samples of the gas are
physically extracted from the reaction chamber for chemical analysis
and if unreacted/quenched components from the crevice are
extracted along with reacted gases from the core [153].

PThese issues have been targeted through the development of
crevice containment configurations, whereby the crevice volume is
isolated from the main reaction chamber once the compression
phase is completed. This has been implemented at the University of
Akron [154] by an O-ring seal around the circumference of the pis-
ton that engages at piston seating, while the reaction chamber
design employed at the University of Michigan [108] naturally seals
the convergent section of the chamber from the crevice volume
with the nose-cosed sabot that seats using an interference fit. These
geometries are illustrated in Fig. 15. Challenges exist when utilizing
this technique however. For instance, CFD calculations of the tem-
perature fields performed in Mittal and Bhari [154] suggested that
under some conditions high velocity flow can be forced into the
reaction chamber from the crevice volume as the seal engages, so
that a small vortex can be generated and evolve during the delay
period. Furthermore, the O-ring seal used to isolate the crevice
from the main reaction chamber can be subjected to severe
mechanical deformation during piston sealing, so that care must be
exercised to avoid particle generation and transport into the reac-
tion chamber due to seal degradation, as described in [154].

P2.1.6. Aerosol fueling and direct test chamber methods

PRCMs, like shock tubes, are typically limited to high volatility
fuels. This is especially pertinent when targeting undiluted condi-
tions where high concentrations of vaporized fuel are needed, e.g.,
1(cid:1)3% mole fraction. Conventionally, tests utilize pre-vaporized
mixtures of
fuel, oxygen and diluent, often mixed externally,
though sometimes within the reaction chamber, so the capability
to supply the gas-phase fuel is restricted by the vapor pressure of
the fuel. Large molecular weight components of jet and diesel fuel
have very low vapor pressures, e.g., 10 mbar and 0.5 mbar, respec-
tively, at temperatures typical of the initial test conditions, e.g.,
Ti D 25(cid:1)120 °C. Oxygen containing molecules can also have very
low vapor pressures. As the need grows for more comprehensive
understanding of the autoignition chemistry of large fuel molecules
and oxygenates, new techniques are needed to facilitate tests with
RCMs. Aerosol fuel loading and direct test chamber methods have
been suggested to address this issue without having to resort to
extremely high premixing tank and reaction chamber tempera-
tures.

using deformable material at the University of Michigan (adapted from [108] with permission of Elsevier).

PIn the aerosol fueling method [155], which was initially devel-
oped for shock tubes [156,157], a mixture of suspended fuel droplets
is created external to the reaction chamber, with the carrier, or bath
gas consisting of the oxidizer and diluent components. The multi-
phase mixture is delivered to the RCM in a continuous flow manner.
Just before the start of the test, the flow is interrupted and the reac-
tion chamber is sealed. As volumetric compression proceeds, the
increase in bath gas temperature leads to vaporization of the fuel
droplets, so by the end of compression the fuel is completely vapor-
ized and mixed with the oxidizer/diluent gas. In designing such an
experiment, the fuel droplets need to be uniformly distributed
within the flow, and must be small enough to ensure complete
vaporization and diffusive mixing by the end of the compression
stroke. This type of experiment is more complicated than typical
tests of gas-phase reactants and higher experimental uncertainties
can therefore result. Challenges are associated with the effects of
droplet impingement during aerosol delivery to the reaction cham-
ber, residual fluid motion during the piston compression process, as
well as accurate determinations of the gas phase fuel concentration
at the end of compression.

PAllen et al. [155] investigated the aerosol delivery process and
mixing within the reaction chamber with help from CFD simulations
and Mie scattering imaging. They also noted that the evaluation of
the compressed gas temperature can be complicated because of the
cooling effects associated with evaporation of the droplets. The con-
cept of aerosol RCMs and the near-droplet phenomena, including
evaporation and fuel vapor transport into the surrounding gas were
later studied through a droplet vaporization model developed by
Goldsborough et al. [158,159]. These studies provided guidelines on
experimental configurations and the interpretation of data. In order
to avoid thermal and compositional stratification, the droplet diame-
ters need to be on the order of just a few micrometers, with the max-
imum useable droplet diameters dependent on the fuel volatility.
The use of neon as a diluent over argon and nitrogen was recom-
mended, because of its higher thermal diffusivity, which can aid
evaporation and thus help reduce local compositional stratification.
PIn the direct test chamber method [160,161], small quantities of
low volatility fuel are directly injected into the reaction chamber
using a multi-pulse injection strategy with a gasoline-style injector.
The multi-pulse approach is intended to achieve precise control over
the total quantity of injected fuel while facilitating the generation of
small droplets within the reaction chamber which aids the evapora-
tion rates. This approach was motivated by the fact that since the
partial pressure requirements of the fuel are lower in the reaction
chamber, as compared to a large external mixing vessel, it may be
possible to achieve better fuel vaporization. In Allen et al. [160] the
fuel vapor was allowed to diffusively mix in the reaction chamber
for a short period of time, generally 2 min, before the compression

Pprocess was initiated. As with the aerosol loading technique, issues
regarding direct confirmation of the gas phase fuel concentration for
each test, as well as the uniformity of the mixture at the end of com-
pression are challenging. While the potential of these two novel
techniques has been experimentally demonstrated, additional work
is needed to further develop these concepts and demonstrate uncer-
tainties low enough to be equivalent with modern pre-vaporized/
premixed test practices.

2.2. RCMs to study physical-chemical interactions

PPhysical-chemical interactions play an important role in com-
bustion engines where, for example the timing of ignition or loca-
tion of flame stabilization, and rates of heat release are affected by
both physical and chemical mechanisms. Interactions can facilitate
stable combustion, or lead to unstable conditions which can result
in excessive pollutant formation, poor efficiencies and other detri-
mental behavior. In extreme cases, the combustion chamber or
engine can be destroyed. Interactions evolve due to temperature
and/or compositional gradients/fluctuations, as well as fluid
dynamic processes.

PWhile the study of autoignition chemistry is a primary focus of
modern RCM experiments and has motivated the design of most
machines, RCMs can also be used to investigate coupled physical-
chemical phenomena, including those associated with large-scale
gradients, turbulence, plasmas and localized gradients created by
phase change. The following briefly discusses these topics and some
design requirements, and directs the interested reader toward rele-
vant work. Configurations used for these studies pose different chal-
lenges than those used to investigate autoignition chemistry,
including the creation of appropriate test conditions, e.g., generation
of desired plasma, as well as integration of requisite diagnostics. Par-
ticularly critical is the requirement for spatially and temporally
resolved data that can complement conventional, volumetrically-
averaged measurements, like pressure, and provide insight into the
physical-chemical interactions. Advanced diagnostics for such stud-
ies are highlighted in Section 3 of this review, while investigations
exploring these interactions are discussed in Section 5.

P2.2.1. Stratified autoignition

PStratified autoignition describes conditions where large-scale
gradients lead to a cascade of ignition events within the reaction
chamber, generally via a propagating wave, as opposed to a defla-
grating front. Stratified autoignition can be used in engine applica-
tions to mitigate pressure rise rates in a range of LTC modes, e.g.,
HCCI [162]. RCMs designed to investigate these processes must gen-
erate controlled, large-scale thermal and/or compositional stratifica-
tion prior to the chemical induction period.

PIida and co-workers [163(cid:1)167] at Keio University configured an
RCM with a non-uniform heating system to thermally stratify the
mixture prior to initiation of compression. The reaction chamber
was mounted horizontally with hotter temperatures located on the
upper side of the cylinder, enhancing buoyancy effects. P€oschl and
Sattelmayer [168] at Technische Universit€at M€unchen implemented
a similar configuration in their machine. A continuous flow system
was used at Keio University to deliver the mixture through three
intake valves located at the base of the cylinder, i.e., bottom-dead-
center, and out two exhaust valves located in the head. The tempera-
tures of the three gas manifolds were individually controlled.
Under steady flow operation, where the gas had an axial velocity of
1.5 cm/s (Re (cid:3) 100), the mixture had a relatively small radial thermal
gradient (DT (cid:3) 10 K), with similar differences in the axial direction.
The overall distribution for an early system design had large bimodal
peaks located near the entrance and the exit of the cylinder; later
tests reported better thermal control, with root mean squared (RMS)
values near §1.5%. After closing the valves and a short residence
time (»2 min) to allow the fluid motion to decay, piston compres-
sion was used to increase the stratification to DT (cid:3) 25(cid:1)52 K, with
RMS values near §2.0(cid:1)2.5%. The design features of this RCM led to
bulk gradients near 1 K/mm at the initiation of compression, which
increased to span DT (cid:3) 50(cid:1)200 K across the bore. Compositional
stratification was also possible in this device by varying the seeding
rate of fuel and/or simulated exhaust gas residuals (CO2 and N2)
through each intake port. For instance, under some scenarios, fuel
was excluded from two of the ports (so only O2 and diluent
flowed), with the fuel was directed through the remaining port.
The fuel gradient could be positively or negatively correlated to the
lateral thermal gradient. Creviced pistons were not included in this
design, and the compression process was relatively slow, with a
maximum piston velocity of 6 m/s, tC D 185 ms, and t50 D 25 ms.
Since a flat piston was used in this machine,
in-cylinder fluid
motion and its influences may have been present during the tests,
but these were not documented.

P2.2.2. Turbulence(cid:1)chemistry interactions

PTurbulence(cid:1)chemistry interactions (TCI) occur when small-scale
gradients and fluctuations are present within the reacting mixture
and the turbulent time scale is on the same order as the characteris-
tic times for chemical reaction. These important phenomena have
been identified in many flame-driven combustion schemes, but can
also be relevant to autoignition-driven, LTC modes [169]. In early
TCI work using RCMs, the turbulence fields were typically not well-
controlled. Modern studies have focused on accurately characteriz-
ing these conditions within RCM reaction chambers. Large-scale
motion, such as corner vortices, can influence the measurements
and must be considered when designing RCMs for studies of small-
scale turbulence effects, while diagnostic implementation, including
location, timing and correlation of events, represent challenges in
machine configuration and operation.

PGriffiths and Franck, and Nimmo and co-workers [75,78]
employed two methods to generate turbulence in their RCM test
chamber. Their first approach, like Tizard and Pye [139], used an
internal fan to stir the gases in the reaction chamber. They also
designed a configuration where perforated mesh plates were placed
at the entrance to the reaction chamber in order to generate turbu-
lent flows during piston compression. As gas is forced through the
holes in the plate, high velocity flows are created in the reaction
chamber. A range of hole sizes and blockages ratios were employed
to achieve different turbulent conditions. Franck et al. [78] demon-
strated the influence of turbulence intensities on the measured igni-
tion delay times, as well as the minimum compressed temperatures
required for autoignition. Guibert et al. [113] at UPMC employed a
similar approach with mesh plates. Because their geometry used a
nose cone where the crevice volume was compressed, or squished,

Pduring the piston seating process such that the crevice gas was
forced into the reaction chamber, high velocity fields were generated
in the reaction chamber at the end of compression. The reaction
chamber was made from transparent sapphire which provided
excellent optical access, and utilized an octagonally shaped external
surface to ease visual bias correction. The optical arrangement
enabled measurements of the rates of turbulent kinetic energy decay
during the delay period.

PPark and Keck [102] highlighted through scaling analyses that
turbulence can also be generated in the reaction chamber when the
piston velocity based Re exceeds 105, or the boundary layer is not
captured by a creviced piston. Ihme [170] used stochastic, reduced-
order modeling to demonstrate the turbulence field can be signifi-
cantly enhanced via high strain rate operation, i.e., high piston
speeds, and through the use of high compression ratios, e.g., CR > 30.
Strozzi et al. [126] configured a square cross-section, flat (uncre-
viced) piston geometry to generate turbulent flows during piston
compression, while the flat walls of the reaction chamber facilitated
complete optical access without the need to correct for distortions
due to curvature. Another approach to generate turbulence is to cre-
ate large scale motion in the reaction chamber before piston com-
pression, as applied in Kojima and Suzuoki [171], where an initial
swirling flow was obtained using gas injectors placed on the periph-
ery of the reaction chamber. A particular challenge for designing
RCM hardware for TCI studies is the transient nature of RCM opera-
tion, and the time decaying statistics of the flow field. Consequently,
it is difficult to achieve reliable, ‘high turbulence, well-stirred uni-
form reaction’ conditions, as identified in Fig. 3, within RCM configu-
rations constructed to date.

P2.2.3. Knock

PKnock is associated with the evolution of gas dynamics within the
combustion chamber,
initiated by localized pressure spikes that
result from non-uniform, uncontrolled chemical heat release. The
propagation of pressure waves can remain sonic, or they can transi-
tion to supersonic detonation waves. Analogous processes occur
within RCMs and shock tubes, but the confined dimensions of RCMs
and associated wave (cid:1) wall interactions are more representative of
IC engines. There is a long history of knock investigation within IC
engine platforms, and many theories have been proposed to describe
its causes and development [172]. Recent work has also focused
on processes leading to superknock [27], as discussed in Section 1.
Some fuels are more prone to knock [173], while the combustion
chamber geometry [174], including the location of any spark plugs,
as well as the operating conditions [175] are influential. Conventional
knock measurements conducted using variable compression ratio
engines [176,177] can be influenced by many factors including evap-
orative cooling of the fuel, complex temperature and composition
fields due to filling processes, and turbulent flame propagation rates.
PTaylor et al. [178] designed one of the first configurations capable
of simultaneous end wall visualization and measurements of the
reaction chamber pressure and piston position during knocking
events. A strain guage was integrated into the crown of the piston,
while a high speed camera recorded markings on the piston shaft as
it traversed its stroke. Optically accessible cylinder heads were also
used by Griffiths et al. [74,179(cid:1)181], Hayashi et al. [182], Katsumata
et al. [183], Wang et al. [184(cid:1)187] and Tanoue et al. [188], while
Tanaka et al. [189] and P€oschl and Sattelmayer [168] employed Bow-
ditch-style pistons. P€oschl and Sattelmayer [168] also integrated
fiber optic access into their cylinder head, while Affleck and Fish
[71] located an optical port into the side-wall of their opposed-pis-
ton configuration. These transmissive heads, pistons and ports
enable recording of spatially-resolved emissions, including direct
and spectrally-filtered, as well as density gradients through the
autoignition and wave generation process. Affleck and Fish [71]
implemented a rapid sampling valve and expansion chamber to

Pextract product gases for quantification of individual species gener-
ated during the knocking process.

PSpark probes have been utilized to investigate forced-ignition
conditions where the probes have been centrally located [71], or
situated in the side-wall of the reaction chamber [168]. Side-wall
configurations allow non-symmetric conditions to be studied, for
instance flame propagation across a positive, or negative tempera-
ture gradient. The use of multiple pressure transducers located
across the reaction chamber can allow a deconvolution of the gas
dynamic processes [168]. Finally, very high speed diagnostics,
including near-megahertz imaging (250(cid:1)300 kfps) and pressure
measurements (200 kHz), as discussed in Section 2, are necessary in
order properly capture the very high speed phenomena that occur
during knock.

P2.2.4. Plasma-enhanced autoignition

PPlasma-enhanced autoignition is an emerging field with potential
application to reciprocating engines and gas turbines. Numerous
techniques have been developed to generate non-equilibrium plas-
mas, e.g., nano-second pulsed discharge, where these plasmas differ
significantly from conventional, equilibrium-type plasmas, e.g.,
spark discharge [190]. For non-equilibrium plasmas, much higher
electron temperatures can be achieved along with lower electron
number densities. Furthermore, non-equilibrium plasmas are more
kinetically active due to the rapid production of active radicals and
excited species via electron impact dissociation, excitation and sub-
sequent energy relaxation. Little is understood about plasma-
enhanced ignition at engine-relevant conditions, and much of the
work to date has been conducted at low pressure and for simple
fuels such as methane. Open questions include how the kinetic path-
ways of plasma-enhanced ignition are dependent on the plasma
properties, gas temperature and fuels, and particularly what interac-
tions occur between the plasma chemistry and low temperature
chemistry of the fuel.

PFew RCM studies have explored plasma-enhanced autoignition
phenomena and opportunities exist for new methods. RCMs must be
integrated thoughtfully with a method to generate the plasma, either
inside the reaction chamber or externally. Boumehdi and co-workers
[191,192] used a high-voltage electrode (d D 20 mm) located directly
on the head of the reaction chamber (bore D 50 mm) to create a
nanosecond pulsed, surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma. Taka-
hashi et al. [193] used a reactor tube located in the inlet manifold of
the RCM to generate a pulsed, dielectric barrier discharge plasma.

_
OH,

€
O, and

PSpecialized plasma diagnostics are required in addition to con-
ventional RCM diagnostics where important measurements include
_
H, ions and electron
number densities of key radicals, e.g.,
densities and local temperature. Plasma generation is not a volumet-
ric process but occurs near the surfaces of the electrodes, so the
capability for spatial resolution in the measurements is important.
Techniques for controlling fluid and aerodynamics, along with pre-
scribing non-stimulated autoignition chemistry are also relevant for
studies of plasma-enhanced autoignition in an analogous way, as for
autoignition chemistry experiments.

P2.2.5. Phase-change induced gradients

PPhase-change induced gradients are particularly relevant to
engine operation where fuel stratification due to spray events can
be used to facilitate an array of LTC schemes. At the smallest
scales, gradients in temperature and composition induced by
evaporation from fuel droplets can alter the chemical kinetic pro-
cesses leading to autoignition. The gradients and induced trans-
port can be much larger than those generated by wall effects.
Single droplets are one way to experimentally investigate the
effects of small-scale gradients in a well-controlled manner, and
have been utilized previously in studies in constant volume ves-
sels. There are only few data at pressure and temperature

Pconditions representative of LTC however. In such tests, a single
droplet is suspended in the reaction chamber using a wire, and
the surrounding gas subsequently compressed volumetrically by
the piston(s). The rising gas temperature induces evaporation
(similar to aerosol fuel loading techniques), and in oxidizing envi-
ronments this can lead to autoignition. Open questions include
how thermal/compositional gradients and transport influence the
evolution of autoignition chemistry, including the dynamics of
cool flame development and propagation [194].

PDesign and operational considerations for these tests include pis-
ton trajectory control to minimize the convolution of the gas com-
pression with fuel volatility, minimization of gas motion near the
droplet surface during and post compression, and ensuring the wire
and wall effects are minimal during the test period. The wire must
be sufficiently strong to withstand the compression heating and
thermal expansion/contraction, yet also sufficiently low mass to
reduce impacting the local state conditions. Fuel evaporation and
autoignition must occur on scales relevant to the gas compression
and heat loss. Necessary diagnostics include optical access and capa-
bility to monitor the two- or three-dimensional coupled physical-
chemical phenomena; especially the means to locate spatially and
temporally the phase interface, gas phase transport of the fuel and
resulting compositional / thermal gradients, and initiation/evolution
of the reaction front.

PKim et al. [195(cid:1)198] used a single-piston RCM geometry with the
droplet (400(cid:1)600 mm) suspended in the center of the final com-
pressed volume using a K-type, fine wire thermocouple (50 mm
wires, 100 mm bead diameter) to study single and bi-component
droplet ignition where effects of fuel volatility and reactivity were
investigated. Compression ratios could be varied from CR D 13 to 18
but with relatively long compression times of tC D 170(cid:1)210 ms
(vmax < 1 m/s). Optical access through the end wall provided a means
to record the droplet size throughout the compression, evaporation
and ignition processes. In some of the tests, advection due to buoy-
ancy and flow past the droplet during piston compression was evi-
dent near the droplet surface, highlighting challenges towards
mitigating this phenomenon and ensure diffusive-controlled trans-
port. Better resolution and measurement of the fuel concentration
and temperature fields could lead to improved fundamental under-
standing that can be derived from the tests.

2.3. Summary

PRCM design and configuration have developed significantly over
the past century, and especially during the past two decades, with
increasing control and manipulation of the reacting gas for both
autoignition chemistry studies, and those of coupled physical-chem-
ical processes. A number of ‘best practices’ have emerged where
these indicate that:

P(cid:4) Lubricants, oils and tiny particles can significantly foul the meas-
urements and should thus be avoided, for instance through easy
cleaning of the reaction chamber, and the use of filters in the
mixture introduction system.

P(cid:4) The gas compression process can affect the fuel/oxidizer chemis-
try, turbulence evolution and intensity, as well as heat loss, and
care should therefore be taken in order to achieve, and quantify
the desired experimental conditions.

P(cid:4) Compressed air provides the fastest rates of compression, while
the use of hydraulics requires sophisticated control mecha-
nisms, and hydraulic systems can be more prone to creep and
rebound.

P(cid:4) Though an important contribution has been the development of
creviced pistons, it is clear that properly configuring the piston
crevice for particular machine geometry and operating condi-
tions is key to adequately suppressing the corner vortex

ate across a wide range of facilities, or a range of experimental
conditions explored during an experimental campaign.

new components and devices are encouraged to leverage past
advances, and to publish detailed descriptions and characteriza-
tion work that demonstrate new capabilities, or limitations of

concepts.
reduced-order models before prototyping new concepts.

PThere are many opportunities to develop new configurations,
especially for continued investigation of physical-chemical interac-
tions, the implementation of increasingly higher fidelity diagnostics,
some of which are discussed in the next Section, and the utilization
of challenging fuels and extreme combustion regimes.

3. Development and application of standard and advanced RCM
diagnostics

PIn this section, methods for and results from the application of
standard and advanced diagnostics are described. These diagnostics
are necessary to achieve accurate observation of autoignition chem-
istry and physical-chemical interactions using RCMs. Some advanced
experimental methods target high fidelity measurements which can
supplement information provided by standard diagnostics, such as
pressure histories, and highlight opportunities for RCM research and
discoveries. Temporal, spatial, and other limiting resolutions for typ-
ical conditions are provided (when available), as well as methods to
overcome experimental challenges.

PAccurate measurements of pressure and estimates of the corre-
sponding temperature are minimum requirements for extracting the
necessary chemical reactivity characteristics for RCM experiments.
Measurements of pressure-time histories have been used since the
1930s to deduce ignition delay times for reacting mixtures. The pres-
sure data have been particularly useful in developing an understand-
ing of reactivity trends covering a range of temperatures, as well as
providing insight into heat loss and preliminary heat release prior to
the main ignition event. It should be noted that ignition time meas-
urements inferred from pressure traces are a result of the convolved
pressure-temperature history experienced during the induction
period, and thus the pressure and temperature information cannot
be easily deconvolved without additional information, as described
in Section 1. Additional details including temperature or species con-
centration measurements can be acquired via supplementary diag-
nostics to provide more complete information on the reactive
system. Details on the thermometry diagnostics are provided in the
references cited in this section and in comprehensive textbooks on
combustion diagnostics (see [199,200] for example).

PA wide range of diagnostics has been applied to RCM studies to
enhance the understanding of the chemistry and flow physics
important for LTC processes. Much has been learned about key reac-
tion pathways during ignition, as well as the effects of temperature,
pressure, heat loss, and fluid motion. The diagnostics can be catego-
rized as intrusive, where the application directly affects the sample
region, as in the case of thermocouples and gas sampling; or non-
intrusive, which generally leverage optical strategies like laser
absorption and laser induced fluorescence (LIF). All modern RCMs
are equipped with pressure transducers to acquire pressure-time
histories, and many use passive imaging in the form of high speed
cameras or photodiodes. A more complete picture of LTC phenom-
ena could be assembled via detailed descriptions of the spatial distri-
bution and time history of pressure, temperature,
intermediate
species and velocity fields. However, the experimental complexity
involved in spatially resolved fast diagnostics is prohibitive, and
often not necessary, to acquire sufficient understanding for develop-
ing and adequately validating predictive combustion models.

PIn the following sub-sections, we briefly introduce dynamic
pressure measurements and describe the implementation and
some of the major results obtained in RCM studies using many
advanced diagnostics. Measurements of temperature within the
reaction chamber are discussed, including examples of intrusive (e.
g. thermocouple) and non-intrusive techniques (e.g. fluorescence).
This is followed by a description of measurements to identify and
quantify stable and radical species, again including intrusive (e.g.
physical sampling) and non-intrusive (e.g. chemiluminescence,
laser absorption and extinction) methods. The section ends with
some examples of flow field measurements (e.g. particle image
velocimetry (PIV)), which are vital in studies of physical-chemical
interactions. The material in this section is meant to introduce the
topics of diagnostic measurements in RCMs, but the review is not
intended to be exhaustive. The reader is encouraged to consult
original references for details on the experimental hardware, analy-
sis, and subtleties associated with advanced diagnostic methods.
Opportunities to implement novel and emerging diagnostics are
discussed in Section 7.

3.1. Pressure measurements

PThere are numerous documents in the scientific, engineering and
commercial literature concerning how to make accurate measure-
ments using pressure sensors (typically based on piezoelectric crys-
tals) including topics of thermal shock, chemical compatibility,
durability and other important concerns [201(cid:1)203]. The IC engine
community has extensively documented methods that thoughtfully
consider these issues and others, such as the appropriate placement
of pressure transducers, analog-to-digital converter resolution,
charge amplifier matching, and triggering. Pressure history data
are routinely conditioned using filtering and averaging methods.
Because pressure measurements are the cornerstone of most RCM
studies, researchers should provide explicit documentation of the
data acquisition and conditioning applied in each study, as well as
examples of typical pressure data for a range of experiments.
Researchers new to RCM investigations are encouraged to explore
texts like the work by Rogers [201] and other important references
on ‘best practices’ for pressure sensor measurements. Data condi-
tioning affects the end-of-compression pressure and therefore end-
of-compression temperatures as well, if they are derived from the
pressure data. The uncertainty analyses should include the effects
of different methods of conditioning pressure data as well as differ-
ent means of defining end-of-compression (e.g. based on local pres-
sure maxima, pressure derivatives, pre- or post-data conditioning).
Even though the effects of pressure data conditioning on state con-
ditions are critical, reporting such analysis is not standard among
RCM studies, although it should be. Some examples of ‘best practi-
ces’ for considering pressure data analysis can be found in Mans-
field et al. [204].

3.2. Temperature measurements

PAutoignition is significantly influenced by the local temperature,
often in an exponential manner. Therefore, even small temporal
and spatial variations in temperature can significantly affect the
evolution of reactions. Thermal gradients and localized hot spots
are particularly associated with the development of non-uniform
ignition phenomena in RCMs. Most RCM studies do not directly
measure temperature, but rather infer temperature from pressure
measurements, e.g., via the adiabatic core hypothesis, as discussed
in Section 4. However, many efforts have pursued measurements of
temperature in RCMs with varying levels of spatial and temporal
fidelity. These endeavors have been critically important towards
reducing the uncertainty associated with investigations of LTC pro-
cesses within RCMs, and are discussed in detail here.

P3.2.1. Schlieren techniques

PSome of the earliest RCM studies took advantage of large areas
of optical access provided by transparent end-wall and side-wall
windows to apply schlieren imaging to study flow physics during
autoignition experiments [69,106]. Later studies applied schlieren
imaging to consider flame progress in RCMs equipped with spark
plugs, e.g. [205,206], and others have applied schlieren and shadow-
graph methods to image fuel spray development in RCMs e.g.
[112,206(cid:1)208] and engine knock phenomena e.g. [182,209(cid:1)211].
Often, these studies include photographic records of combustion
and ignition chemiluminescence, which offer further information on
the levels of homogeneity within the test chamber of the RCM
experiments.

PSchlieren imaging provides a measure of the density gradient,
which is a direct, qualitative indication of the thermal gradient,
when there are no pressure oscillations in the test chamber and the
mixture is homogeneous and non-reacting. With careful calibration,
schlieren imaging can be used for quantitative line-of-sight aver-
aged temperature measurement; however, schlieren methods have
been predominantly applied for qualitative studies in autoignition
experiments.

PIn the seminal work by Livengood and Leary [106], the authors
present schlieren images of isooctane and benzene autoignition
with comparison to non-reacting schlieren images of compressed
air. Significant non-uniformities were observed during the ignition
process of the different fuels. The authors proposed that the
observed temperature inhomogeneities could be attributed (in part)
to the piston travel during the compression phase where this
“scrapes off the boundary layer of air from the cylinder walls, pro-
ducing a turbulent region at the periphery of the chamber. . .” The
work by Livengood and Leary [106] was the first to suggest caution
in the exclusive use of pressure measurements to characterize auto-
ignition, both with regards to ignition time measurements, as well
as determination of the characteristic state conditions for the test.
The schlieren imaging data of Griffiths et al. [212], similar to earlier
results [69,106], showed spatial aspects to ignition of n-pentane and
the formation of ignition kernels. Later work by Strozzi et al. [126]
used qualitative schlieren imaging to show the formation of roll-up
vortices at the corners of the piston and test chamber for their
square cross-sectioned, flat piston RCM. The same data describe the
extent of thermal homogeneity within the test section and the time
scales of fluid-motion enhanced transport. These studies provided
the foundation for further work on the flow physics of RCMs,
how these influence the ignition measurements and how they can
be mitigated, and motivated the quantitative measurements of
temperature fields that develop in RCM studies.

P3.2.2. Thermocouple measurements

PThermocouples provide well established methods to quantify the
temperature field in combustion systems, while recognizing such
measurements require corrections for radiation, conduction and
convection heat transfer, and researchers must be aware of potential
catalytic interactions. Additionally, fine wires and small junctions
are required for adequate time response and good spatial resolution,
which necessitates the use of fragile experimental equipment. How-
ever, there are several RCM studies that have successfully applied
thermocouples for accurate temperature measurements with good
spatial and temporal fidelity.

PThe pioneering work of Desgroux et al. [144] demonstrated Ray-
leigh scattering to measure core gas temperatures in an RCM. The
optical measurements were complemented with fine wire thermo-
couple measurements [145]. The thermocouple measurements were
placed across the radius of the RCM at 5 mm intervals in the central
region of the test section, with higher resolution (1 mm) in the ther-
mal boundary layer near the wall. The single thermocouple, inserted
through a 1.2 mm double-bore ceramic rod was relocated after each

Ptest to build a composite image of the temperature profile within
the reaction chamber. The time response of a thermocouple is a
function of both the size of the thermocouple bead and the local gas
dynamic conditions. For reference, Desgroux et al. [145] used 12 mm
chromel-alumel wire with an estimated time response of less than
3 ms, and a data sampling rate of 25 kHz. Compression times were
adjusted to a duration of tC D 100 ms in order to minimize the effects
of the reaction chamber wall thermal dynamics. The results were the
first to provide spatially and temporally resolved data on the ther-
mal fields as they evolve during a typical RCM test. The studies of
non-reacting and reacting experiments conducted with a non-crev-
iced piston showed regions of fairly good thermal uniformity, where
bulk gradients on the order of 5 K/mm [145,213] were observed in
the time immediately after the end of compression, as seen in Fig 16.
The data presented in Fig. 16 are for mixtures with 1.65% isooctane,
where the 20.65% oxygen is replaced with N2 in the non-reacting
mixture. The non-reacting data, as mentioned in Section 2, indi-
cated the formation of a cooler toroidal region surrounding the cen-
tral portion of the RCM test section. Comparison of the non-reacting
and reacting data showed that heat release during the preliminary
stages of ignition, i.e., LTHR, attenuated this stratification and led to
a more thermally though not compositionally homogeneous mix-
ture. The thermocouple measurements by Desgroux et al. [145] and
later work by Donovan et al. [108] indicated that the thermal
boundary layers that formed near the walls of the respective RCMs
could be on the order of 3(cid:1)5 mm after 50 ms post-compression,
where bore-to-height ratios were 2.3 and 0.5(cid:1)1.0, respectively.
While the fine wire thermocouples used in these studies (12 mm
wire in [145] and 25 mm wire in [108]) provided good spatial and

ing RCM experiment and (b) a reacting RCM experiment. End of compression is
100 ms in both panels where Tc (cid:3) 700 K and pc (cid:3) 8 bar The data show the good ther-
mal uniformity that can be achieved in the core, or central region of the RCM immedi-
ately after the end of compression, and how a toroidal thermal structure evolves near
125 ms, 25 ms after the end of compression. LTHR within the reacting mixture attenu-
ates the magnitude of the temperature gradient as a function of time. (reprinted from

Ptemporal resolution (around »1(cid:1)10 ms for ignition experiments;
where the time response varies as a function of the bead size,
material and the Nusselt number of the RCM test conditions, as dis-
cussed in [108]), the thermocouples are often not sufficiently robust
to withstand the conditions of autoignition, especially with undi-
luted mixtures.

P3.2.3. Rayleigh scattering, fluorescence and absorption techniques

POptical diagnostics are more complex to deploy, but more robust
than thermocouples while providing adequate spatial and temporal
resolution. The spatial fidelity is generally better and the response
time faster, but data acquisition rates, which are a function of laser
pulse repetition, may be slower. Signal to noise issues can also result
in larger uncertainty bands for the measurements, and the data can-
not be easily averaged, as is often done in reciprocating engine stud-
ies where the cycle repetition rates are much higher than for most
RCMs. Optical access in RCMs can vary from the large windows used
in schlieren and chemiluminescence studies, to small ports with
windows around 1 cm in diameter. Line of sight diagnostics such
as laser absorption, typically use opposed ports, whereas Rayleigh
scattering and fluorescence require orthogonal optical access.

PDesgroux et al. [144,145] were the first to use Rayleigh scattering
measurements for temperature measurements. The repetition rate
of their laser (10 Hz, a pulsed frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser pro-
viding emission at 532 nm) limited the measurements to discrete
intervals after the end of compression in their RCM (nominally one
data point each, taken 100 ms after the end of compression), and
high interference from reflections limited measurements near the
wall [144,145]. The authors quoted a temperature accuracy of 3(cid:1)4%,
or §30 K, at the experimental conditions studied. The path-averaged
measurements provided some corroboration with the thermocouple
data, though questions arose regarding discrepancies between
the datasets, including differences in fidelity and tradeoffs between
the techniques.

PClarkson et al. [214] extensively characterized the temperature
field in their RCM using acetone LIF and Rayleigh scattering of non-
reacting and reacting test gas mixtures. LIF and Rayleigh scattering
signals, like many optical diagnostics, are sensitive to the density of
the test gas mixture as well as the composition. Thus, quantifying
the measurements from these diagnostics requires an understanding
of the evolution of the state conditions and extent of chemical reac-
tion during autoignition. Clarkson et al. [214] made recommenda-
tions on how to successfully apply LIF and Rayleigh methods to
identify spatial structures in RCM flow fields. Similarly to Desgroux
et al. [144,145], the authors conjectured that a toroidal structure
existed for their RCM hardware at the conditions studied, consisting
of a vortex formed at the end of compression where the center or
core region of the test gases could experience temperatures colder
than the surrounding fluid. The evidence for the fluid motion
included higher LIF signals in the center of test chamber than the
surroundings, as shown in Fig. 17(a). The LIF data also showed that
the thermal stratification was attenuated to a more uniform profile
by 30 ms after the end compression, as seen in Fig. 17(b). To further
study thermal stratification in the RCM, Clarkson et al. [214] also
used ditertbutyl peroxide (DTBP) as a thermo-chemical marker,
where exothermicity from the decomposition of the DTBP amplified
the pre-existing temperature field. Calibration of these optical meth-
ods for quantitative data is challenging. However, as noted in [214],
qualitative data can yield significant insight into the flow physics in
RCMs, just as in other reactors. Particularly, as identified in Section
2, these measurements have been crucial towards the development
of RCM configurations that can achieve more uniform conditions in
the reaction chamber for autoignition chemistry studies.

POptical diagnostics can also provide insight via semi-quantitative
measurements, where the measurements can be normalized, or
compared relative to a reference condition. For example, Griffiths

the LIF intensity (arbitrary units, since the signal was not calibrated) integrated over
the width of the laser beam. The pixel number represents the distance across the
width of the end-view imaging of the RCM (»0.2 mm/pixel). (reprinted from [214]

Pand co-workers used planar Rayleigh scattering to provide quantita-
tive measurements of the relative temperature field in their RCM
[74]. Representative scattering intensity data from [74] are pre-
sented in Fig. 18. When composition and pressure are constant
within the test volume, the scattering data can show the variation
and evolution in the temperature field at each discrete measurement
time. It should be highlighted that due to the 10 Hz laser repetition
rate, the images for each of these panels represent data averaged
from four different tests. The authors claimed excellent repeatability
of the tests, however. The two columns in the figure show data for
n-pentane/air ignition studies at two end of compression tempera-
tures, Tc D 690 K and 770 K. Because the state and composition
change as a function of time during the autoignition experiments,
the primary goal of the measurements was to understand the evolu-
tion of the temperature field at each point of the reaction progress.
As seen in Fig. 18, the temperature fields appear to be quite uniform
in the core of the chamber shortly before ignition (t D ¡2.8 ms)
where random, localized fluctuations were on the order of §4(cid:1)9 K,
with gradients near 10(cid:1)30 K/mm. For the Tc D 690 K condition
(Fig. 18a), the higher signals at the center of the test section that
develop at later times indicate cooler gases in the center relative to
the surrounding gases. The thermal stratification is attributed to a
roll-up vortex as the piston did not incorporate a crevice. The higher
signals at the edges of the images are attributed to interference from
reflection off the windows. The lower gradients in the signals out-
side of the region of interference were attributed to the development

Pof the thermal boundary layer, where this was interpreted as
approximately 5 mm thick. Assuming a uniform thickness of the
boundary layer around the core of the reactive gas, this suggests that
the boundary layer region occupied about 70% of the volume at these
conditions. Given the large bore to height ratio geometry, most of
the boundary layer penetration is in the axial direction. For Tc D 770
K (Fig. 18b), the temperature profile appears to evolve in a skewed
fashion, which the authors attributed to the formation and propaga-
tion of a flame across the reaction chamber, where this led to knock
at these conditions [74]. Though the measurements of the tempera-
ture field are made at discrete time intervals during the delay period
and only relative temperature can be deduced from the data, the
temporal and spatial resolution of this application of Rayleigh scat-
tering is very good.

PMittal and Sung [148] employed one-dimensional acetone LIF
using non-reacting mixtures to compare the temperature gradients
formed in an RCM equipped with a creviced piston to results using a
non-creviced piston. The authors applied a correction for absorption
that improves the sensitivity of this LIF method, and with some
assumptions and the use of a simplified one-dimensional gas model,
absolute temperatures were obtained from the data. Uncertainties
in temperature were estimated to be around §1.5% (§11 K), while
the scatter in the measurements was close to §0.5%. The spatial res-
olution was twice that obtained by Griffiths et al. [74], around
0.1 mm/pixel, while the experiments were similarly conducted using
a 10 Hz pulsed laser with data acquired at one discrete time during
each test. The LIF results showed that gradients due to uncontrolled
bulk fluid motion from the corner vortex could be on the order of
50(cid:1)100 K/mm. When the authors utilized a creviced piston, the cor-
ner vortex could be suppressed and the temperature of the gas in
the reaction chamber was more uniform, with bulk gradients mea-
sured to be on the order of 1(cid:1)5 K/mm, while peak local gradients
were near 5(cid:1)10 K/mm. Random temperature fluctuations were
observed to be less than 1% in the core gas for the creviced piston,
but larger (1.5(cid:1)3.0%) for the flat piston.

PMore recently, Strozzi et al. [122,215] applied planar laser
induced fluorescence (PLIF) to oxygen-free toluene mixtures to
temperature field
measure the instantaneous two-dimensional
formed in their RCM, which was designed with a square cross-
section to facilitate (in part) planar imaging, and utilized a non-
creviced piston. Their configuration was not designed to suppress

Pfluid dynamic motion, but to achieve turbulent conditions that are
similar to operating IC engines. In the absence of oxygen, toluene
provides higher fluorescence signals compared to acetone, and
toluene fluorescence has high sensitivity to temperature for the
conditions studied. The authors used a frequency quadrupled Nd:
YAG laser with 10 Hz repetition rate and the fluorescence data
were recorded with a 10 Hz sampling rate using an intensified
charge coupled device (ICCD) camera. As with earlier investiga-
tions, multiple tests were required in order to build a composite
dataset of the evolution of the temperature field. Their optical
arrangement yielded similar spatial resolution as Mittal and Sung
[148] of about 0.1 mm/pixel. Careful calibration methods were
used to create accurate, absolute, quantitative temperature meas-
urements. The spectroscopic theory and data analytics applied are
well described in Strozzi et al. [122]. Some results of their study
are shown in Fig. 19, where the data indicate both the large- and
small-scale features of the temperature field resolved in these
PLIF studies. The uncertainty in temperature was estimated to be
§5% (§45 K) at the highest temperatures, which were found in the
core region, and §1% (§10 K) at colder temperatures, e.g., in the
vortex or boundary layer. RMS temperatures across the core of the
reaction chamber were near §30(cid:1)60 K, where local fluctuations
were close to §14 K. Representative gradients are indicated in the
Fig. 19.

PDue to the high quenching rate of toluene by oxygen, toluene-
based PLIF cannot be applied to igniting mixtures; however, Griffiths
et al. [212] applied PLIF of acetone for thermometry and PLIF of
formaldehyde to reacting mixtures to study the complex effects of
thermal feedback, comparing an NTC (n-pentane) with a non-NTC
(DTBP) fuel. The PLIF data of the formaldehyde formed during igni-
tion were not converted to temperatures, but rather used as markers
of the intermediates formed during ignition of the two parent fuels.
The interactions between the reaction kinetics and the intrinsic tem-
perature fields created in their RCM led to interesting observations
regarding the relative reactivity of the fuel mixtures in cooler
and hotter zones. The authors concluded that a zero-dimensional
approximation of the test may be valid for RCM ignition studies
using fuels with positive temperature dependent reaction, even
when spatial inhomogenieties are present. However, the same could
not be said for NTC fuels exhibiting two-stage ignition behavior;
in this case the validity of a zero-dimensional approach and the

Pinterpretation of appropriate state conditions for the experiments
were described as questionable.

PNasir and Farooq [216] recently applied quantum cascade laser
absorption to make time-resolved temperature measurements (with
time resolution <10 ms) in both non-reacting (CO/N2) and reacting
(n-pentane/air doped with CO) mixtures. The temperature measure-
ments were line-of-sight averaged and based on two-line resonance
absorption spectroscopy of CO. As with many of the studies previ-
ously discussed, the results confirmed the RCM compression was
well-represented as an adiabatic core process. They estimated the
measurement uncertainty at §6.3% or approximately §50 K, and
with this diagnostic showed discrepancies in both the time of first-
stage ignition, and extent of low temperature heat release compared
to a detailed chemical kinetic model. The time resolution of the
quantum cascade laser diagnostic enables further studies to poten-
tially apply inversion methods to multiple probe beams to evaluate
spatial effects in RCMs.

3.3. Species measurements: radicals, stable intermediates and products

PSimilar to temperature measurements in RCMs, species measure-
ments can be categorized as intrusive (e.g. physical sampling) or
non-intrusive (e.g. laser absorption). Sampling measurements tend
to allow a large range of species to be identified and quantified
simultaneously, whereas optically based methods can provide meas-
urements of short-lived radicals, as well as provide additional tem-
poral and spatial fidelity in comparison to gas sampling. However,
the range of species measurements demonstrated with optical tech-
niques is more limited. Highlights and examples of both approaches
are provided in the following subsections.

P3.3.1. Gas sampling methods

PPhysical sampling of the test gases in RCM experiments has
yielded powerful insights into important reaction pathways during
autoignition. Physical sampling combined with analytical methods
like gas chromatography (GC) can be used to measure a broad
range of species including the stable reactants, intermediates, and
products of combustion. There are two general strategies employed
for gas sampling: quench all the gases in the test chamber to
increase the volume of gas available for analysis, or extract a small
sample that minimizes the impact on the rest of the test gases in
the RCM. Fig. 20 shows schematics of the typical hardware used for
the two approaches. Both methods have merits and challenges, and
sampling durations for both methods are typically on the order of
1(cid:1)2 ms. The physical sampling times limit these methods to autoig-
nition regimes where the chemical time scales are longer than the
sampling duration, to allow adequate time resolution. The use of a
punctured diaphragm, as indicated in Fig. 20a, minimizes the sam-
pling time for the former approach. In all cases an evacuated cham-
ber is connected to the test section of the RCM, and the gas sample
is extracted by expansion. The pressure differential between the
test section and the sample chamber ensures that the reaction
progress of the test gas mixture is quenched by rapidly decreasing
the temperature. When sampling valves are used, the studies are
usually limited to compressed pressures of pc <30 bar due to diffi-
culties of rapidly actuating and sealing the sampling valves. All
methods require an understanding of the quenching process and
quantification of any “dead” or unreacted volume of the test
section, e.g., piston crevice, and sampling system. The unreacted
volume of gases dilutes the sample and is a factor in the uncer-
tainty of the gas sampling measurements.

PGas-sampling has been applied to RCM experiments for decades
led by the pioneering work of Martinengo et al. [218], Roblee [219]
and Fish et al. [73]. Roblee [219] sampled intermediates by ruptur-
ing a diaphragm and rapidly expanding and quenching the entire
test gas mixture into an expansion chamber. The geometry and size
of the expansion chamber is critical to quenching the reactivity of
the test gas mixtures as described in Roblee [219]. The sampling
system used by Fish et al. [73] expanded the test chamber gases
into nitrogen, using expansion cooling and dilution to prevent
further reaction.

PThe ignition study by Fish et al. [73] demonstrated how insightful
gas sampling can be in terms of elucidating reaction chemistry.
Using sampling and gas chromatography, the authors quantified
over 40 intermediate species formed during 2-methylpentane/air
ignition studies, as well as upper limits on 7 additional species. By
referencing the species measured to the initial fuel concentration,
the authors identified the yields in the major classes of intermediate
species (alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, etc.) and used the
data to describe the reaction pathways of cool flame and two-stage
ignition chemistry.

PThe study by Fish et al. [73] is an example of how the mass bal-
ance of the parent fuel can be closed by taking into account all of the
important reaction pathways. Such studies provide further informa-
tion on branching fractions of overall reaction pathways, as well as
absolute reaction rates. Often however, not all peaks in the gas chro-
matograms can be identified or quantified. Calibration standards are
required for each species, and this is an expensive and time consum-
ing process. Additionally, standards are often not available or are
highly toxic. Fortunately, flame ionization detectors often allow cali-
bration factors to be extrapolated from similar species (same num-
ber of carbon atoms, same functional groups), at the expense of
increased uncertainty relative to calibration factors based on abso-
lute standards. Detection limits for species with absolute standards
vary, but can readily be sub-part per million. Multiple gas chroma-
tography ovens, columns and temperature programs are required to

Paccurately separate a broad range of species. Carbon recovery can be
challenging for intermediates from some constituents such as
heavier hydrocarbons or very polar species, which can adsorb or
absorb to the walls of the sampling vessel or condense in the mani-
fold that connects the reaction chamber to the analytical unit. How-
ever, quantitative and accurate measurements can be readily made
for many species, and recent improvements in analytical techniques,
such as multidimensional GC [220], hold promise for providing
isomeric distinction between many intermediate species.

PFollowing these early works, gas sampling has become a useful
diagnostic for RCMs. Speciation studies conducted at the University
of Leeds have applied gas sampling to RCM autoignition studies of
isopropyl nitrate [118] and normal/branched paraffins [77]. Specia-
tion studies at ULST have applied gas sampling to RCM ignition
studies covering a wide range of fuel structures including: normal
alkanes and alkenes [80,81,84,221(cid:1)223], saturated and unsaturated
cyclic alkanes [83], alkyl cycloparaffins [224], alkyl-substituted aro-
matics [225] and methyl esters [226]. At the University of Michigan,
the approach of using small gas samples has been developed and
applied to a range of fuels including alkanes [227(cid:1)229], alcohols
[217,228], and esters [230(cid:1)232]. The results of these studies have
provided new insights into autoignition chemistry. For example,
recent work by Wagnon et al. [232] identified high uncertainties in
the reaction chemistry of unsaturated esters and the reaction path-
ways involving smaller unsaturated and poly-unsaturated stable
and radical species. Representative results from this work are illus-
trated in Fig. 21 where noticeable achievements were made in
model predictions. Similarly, recent gas sampling measurements
from RCM studies at Tsinghua University have highlighted discrep-
ancies in model predictions of intermediate species during isobuta-
nol ignition [233].

PExhaust gas analyzers provide another means to measure the
products of combustion (CO, CO2, NOx, UHCs, etc.) and have been
used to quantify combustion efficiency in RCM fuel studies [234]
and to measure NOx production [189,234,235]. The primary products

Pdeuterium or tungsten-iodine lamps) which were spectrally filtered
(e.g., using monochromators) to target measurements of the species
of interest like NO2 and HNO [118]. As noted in [73], care must be
taken to correct for interfering species, background emission and
other optical phenomena. Generally, these studies also include care-
ful execution of calibration experiments or validation of important
spectroscopic constants, like absorption cross sections and broaden-
ing coefficients. In some measurements and studies, absorption and
emission features can be used to identify unknown intermediate
species: in [73] ultraviolet absorption was identified as due to the
formation of unsaturated carbonyl and b-dicarbonyl intermediates
during 2-methylpentane combustion with oxygen. The same absorp-
tion measurements were combined with gas chromatography meas-
urements, and allowed the authors to propose a detailed oxidation
pathway for 2-methylpentane at intermediate temperatures and
high pressures (Tc D 713(cid:1)933 K, pc D 10(cid:1)40 bar).

PEmission from chemiluminescence has been extensively applied
to RCM studies to document the spatial and temporal characteristics
of autoignition. These measurements have been enabled by dramatic
improvements in the past decade in the time response and sensitiv-
ity of high-speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) cameras. The high intensities of chemiluminescence that
occurs during ignition are well captured using modern CMOS cam-
eras which can provide temporal resolution of over 250,000 frames
per second. Results of high speed imaging studies include identifying
conditions associated with homogeneous and inhomogeneous igni-
tion behavior [204,238,239], characterizing the effects of charge
stratification and induced turbulence [113,240,241], identifying spa-
tial features associated with knocking conditions [74,183,242] such
as the formation of shock waves during knocking [127,241], and the
effects of thermal stratification on ignition [164,167,215]. Fig. 22
presents chemiluminescence imaging data acquired by Griffiths
et al. [74] during studies of knocking and non-knocking ignition of
n-pentane at two thermodynamic state conditions. The images dem-
onstrate the physical changes in the ignition characteristics associ-
ated with knocking conditions [212].

PICCD cameras have also been applied to chemiluminescence
studies in RCM facilities. In addition to good sensitivity in the visible
wavelength region, ICCD cameras are particularly sensitive in the
_
ultraviolet, where key species like
OH and NO have resonant features
and are often used as the sensor array in fluorescence studies which
are discussed below. In the work by Lim et al. [163], the authors
used ICCD imaging to characterize the effects of buoyant thermal
stratification on autoignition, with spatial resolution of 0.67 mm/
pixel and 8 images per cycle, using exposure times of 0.44 ms.

PAbsorption, emission and fluorescence methods can be applied
using naturally occurring species as in chemiluminescence investi-
gations, or by doping the reactant mixtures with additives. Recently,
laser absorption methods have been applied to RCM studies to mea-
sure targeted species, where this is different from early absorption
or emission studies which used recorded spectral characteristics to
identify various species. When additives such as acetone, toluene or
water are used, experimental validation must typically be under-
taken in order to demonstrate that the autoignition processes are
not significantly perturbed (chemically, thermally or otherwise) by
the additives.

PHe et al. [243] were the first to apply narrow-line absorption of
_
ultraviolet emission to
OH measurements during ignition studies of
isooctane. Following this, Sung and co-workers [236,244] applied
quantum cascade lasers to use near infrared laser scanning (200 Hz)
to obtain line-of-sight averaged temperature measurements based
on H2O spectra with both non-reacting and reacting gases in a crev-
iced-piston RCM. The studies demonstrated the application of high-
fidelity laser absorption methods in RCMs to investigate reaction
chemistry with part-per-million detectivity limits as seen in Fig. 23
and simulated
[243],

and thermometry with experimental

sion of Elsevier).

Pof combustion are typically measured post-ignition. By physically
sampling at different times after the end of compression, physical
sampling and exhaust gas analyzers, like GCs, can be used to create
quantitative time histories of these key species during and after the
ignition delay period. A challenge to measurements using exhaust
gas analyzers is the relatively high minimum detectable limit and
the relatively large sample volumes required for some devices. How-
ever, Van Blarigan et al. [234] described procedures to address these
issues.

P3.3.2. Absorption, emission, and fluorescence spectroscopy

PShort-lived radicals provide excellent targets for validating and
developing reaction mechanisms for autoignition processes relevant
to LTC. Because radicals recombine during most physical sampling
methods, attractive in situ diagnostics to measure radicals are
absorption, emission and fluorescence spectroscopy. Of course,
stable species can be measured using absorption and emission diag-
nostics, and such measurements also provide insight into fuel
consumption and major product reaction pathways. However,
absorption, emission and fluorescence diagnostics require accurate
understanding of the bulk and local temperature, pressure and com-
position in order to extract quantitative data on the radical or stable
species. Conversely, accurate understanding of the composition is
required to extract quantitative measurements of temperature.
Thus, there are many challenges as the reaction chemistry evolves
and with it ensuing endo- or exothermicity. Some methods com-
bine spectral features and methods to measure species concentra-
tions and temperature at the same time [236,237]. Line-of-sight
methods are further enabled by good spatial homogeneity of the
conditions probed by the laser or other light source, and thus the
development of strategies such as optimized creviced pistons has
significantly improved the capability to confidently implement
these techniques.

PSome of the earliest combustion chemistry studies using RCMs
like the work by Fish et al. [73] and Beeley et al. [118] applied
absorption spectroscopy using broad band light sources (such as

Pand Cheng [245] followed this laser extinction study with measure-
ments of soot formation under rich n-butane/O2/Ar conditions, while
Di Sante [246] used similar techniques to measure soot yields for
blends of n-heptane/toluene under rich conditions (’ D 3), covering
a range of temperatures from Tc D 675 to 800 K at pc D 11 bar

3.4. Velocity field characterization

PFew RCM studies have focused on quantifying flow field veloci-
ties, even though such data can be important towards understanding
a number of physical-chemical interaction phenomena. The lack of
data may be attributed to challenges associated with making these
measurements. In particular, intrusive methods such as hot wire
anemometry [205,247] can distort the flow field, and are generally
limited to point measurements, while optically based methods
require good optical access, significant signal calibration, and typi-
cally need some means to seed the flow [113,215,240]. Due to the
non-continuous nature of RCM operation, it is difficult to seed the
gas with particles and prevent them from settling prior to initiation
of the test. However, these challenges are offset by the significant
understanding provided by quantitative knowledge of the flow field.
One important area of current research is improving the quantitative
understanding of the effects of turbulence on chemical reactivity.
RCM studies provide an excellent opportunity to address these
fundamental issues, as demonstrated in [113,215,240]. It should
be noted that studies to date have been conducted in machines
designed to encourage turbulent flow fields, as opposed to geome-
tries configured to suppress fluid dynamic processes, as described in
Section 2. There are no experimental velocimetry studies to date
which have used creviced piston configurations.

PAs an example, Strozzi et al. [215] used PIV, seeded with zirco-
(dmean D 5 mm, dmax D 14 mm) deposited
nium oxide particles
directly into the evacuated reaction chamber and subsequently
mixed with the test gases in situ, using a pre-test residence time of
2 min to minimize residual flows. They conducted measurements of
the flow fields created in their square cross-section RCM where
autoignition of lean methane/air mixtures was studied. They com-
bined the PIV data (acquired using a laser pulse interval of 40 ms)
with chemiluminescence (acquired at 5(cid:1)9 kHz, 0.13(cid:1)0.26 mm/
pixel), and PLIF thermometry (described earlier) to provide a com-
prehensive understanding of the ignition characteristics in terms of
the ignition criterion first proposed by Zeldovich [248] and Gu et al.
[249], and extended by Sankaran et al. [250]. In particular, the data
presented in Fig. 25 show that the initial location of the ignition
is consistent with the hottest region identified in the
kernel
temperature field and this region is where the local ignition delay
time is the shortest. Heat is released by a combination of deflagra-
tive and autoignitive processes, depending on the local conditions.
The authors conducted extensive analysis of the two-dimensional
experimental data and used fundamental
theory to quantify
the thermal stratification and the effects on the local ignition
environment.

PThe study by Guibert et al. [240] similarly leveraged multiple
advanced diagnostics and further considered the effects of turbu-
lence intensity on autoignition behavior in the test section of their
RCM. Fig. 26 presents instantaneous results from the PIV measure-
ments where starch particles with dmean D 20 mm were used and
delivered via entrainment in the intake manifold of the machine.
The PIV data, acquired using a laser pulse interval of 1.4 ms, were
used to determine mean kinetic energy data, where some results as
a function of the time after the end of compression are presented in
Fig. 27. The RCM in the study employed a nose-cone geometry and a
small crevice volume at the exterior of the larger, main bore of the
machine to control the vortex rollup and capture some of the bound-
ary layer gases. However, most of the rollup gases are forced into the
smaller bore reaction chamber near the time of piston seating.

reduced to nearly §1% and §5%, respectively, for tests where 0.6%
H2O was seeded into the test mixture, and these were within § 5 K
of adiabatic core calculations. Multiple passes of the laser beam
(e.g., 6) were found to also reduce the measurement uncertainties.
Care was taken in these tests to ensure that the thermal boundary
layer occupied, at most, 5% of the laser path for each reported
measurement.

mation during ignition of n-heptane. By combining the laser attenu-
ation diagnostic with exhaust gas analysis, the authors were able to
identify mixture compositions and state conditions where NOx and
particulate emissions were simultaneously lowered. Kitsopanidis

distance from the center of the reaction chamber, and ‘y’ is the distance from the piston face. The temperature and velocity field data were acquired from non-reacting experi-
ments at 10 ms (left panels) and 30 ms (right panels) after the end of compression, where the reacting mixtures ignited at 10 and 30 ms, respectively. The temperatures were
determined using toluene PLIF and the velocities were determined using PIV during separate tests. Note that the PLIF measurements, due to signal to noise ratio limitations, were
conducted for only one half of the reaction chamber bore and the uniformly symmetric temperature field is assumed and imposed in the top panels. The emission intensity con-
tours were acquired from high speed imaging using a CMOS camera where Tc D 945 and 928 K and pc D 38.4 and 40.7 bar, respectively. (adapted from [215] with permission of
Elsevier).

PBecause of this arrangement, the flow fields in the reaction chamber
exhibit high velocities; much higher than with the geometry used in
[122]. The data for the tests showed the characteristic time for the
rate of turbulence dissipation can be of the same order as the charac-
teristic times for autoignition for the fuel-air mixtures studied. The
data indicated that the residual turbulence levels in the reaction
chamber can affect the progress of autoignition, and thus measured
ignition delay times and pressure rise rates. This is of course depen-
dent on the particular mixtures used, operating conditions explored
and RCM hardware utilized, though it is clear that for shorter igni-
tion times there will be a greater competition between the kinetics
and turbulence.

3.5. Summary

PThe development and application of standard and advanced RCM
diagnostics have enabled much needed insight into chemicophysical
processes that occur within RCMs. Whereas the studies discussed
here indicate a general pattern for temperature field measurements,
one should be cautious with generalizations. Mixture composition
and operating pressure can affect the heat transfer properties of the
experiments, via the thermal diffusivity, while RCMs use different
strategies to create the experimental conditions of interest, for
example square versus circular cross-sections, with and without pis-
ton crevice volumes, wall heating versus ambient surroundings,

Pmass spectroscopy provide more information with higher accuracy
than previous achievable.

PLaser diagnostics have also advanced providing higher temporal
and spatial resolution than physical sampling methods, albeit for
fewer species. Readers are directed to the numerous excellent
reviews of these spectroscopic methods for more information on the
implementation details of laser diagnostics, e.g. [251(cid:1)255]. Simulta-
neous application of independent measurements (gas sampling or
optically based) will provide further opportunities to refine reaction
rate theory and improve the predictive capabilities of modeling
combustion chemistry.

PThe work in [215] and [113] were the first of their kind to apply
such in-depth and complementary measurements and analysis for
low and high turbulence conditions, respectively. The studies high-
light opportunities for future explorations of turbulence and chem-
istry interactions, while also indicating the care that must be used
in understanding the complex fluid motion and chemistry interac-
tions within RCMs. The results also highlight the high quality
experimental evidence that can be acquired using RCMs to under-
stand turbulence - combustion chemistry interactions at conditions
that are highly relevant to current and next generation combustion
systems. In particular, RCMs provide powerful experimental plat-
forms to develop and validate combustion theory that is described
in Section 4. Few experimental platforms provide the time scales
necessary for such studies.

4. Autoignition regimes and modeling

PAutoignition regimes are distinguishable based on characteristic
time scales including compression, reaction, heat release and diffu-
sion (molecular and turbulent), as discussed in Section 1. Fundamen-
tally, these are associated with competing and/or coupled physical-
chemical processes. Various regimes are targeted during an RCM
experimental campaign via specialized machine configuration and/
or operating conditions. Modeling is often undertaken to comple-
ment RCM experiments, for instance towards the development and
validation of chemical kinetic and other models, to facilitate analysis
of the experimental data, or assist in the creation of more robust or
diverse experimental configurations. To some degree, it is necessary
to account for facility influences and/or physical interactions during
any RCM test, as it is for most experimental measurements [256].

PThis section provides additional detail on autoignition regimes,
specifically as they relate to RCM tests, and definitions of parameters
used later in this text. Furthermore, various modeling frameworks
are described, where these are able to provide, with increasing fidel-
ity, representations of facility effects and coupled physical-chemical
interactions that can occur within a reaction chamber during a
test. There are still many open questions concerning modeling
approaches for RCM experiments so that rigorous recommendations
of ‘best practices’ cannot be made at this time, however the state-of-
the-art is summarized at the end of the section.

4.1. Definitions

PFactors which influence the development of autoignition
behaviors include thermal and/or compositional stratification,
chemical kinetic sensitivity, endo-/exothermicity and the trans-
port characteristics of the reacting medium. Stratification and/or
fluctuations in temperature or composition within the reacting
gas can favor different chemical pathways, while kinetic sensitiv-
ity can cause the mixture to react on significantly different time
scales depending on the local conditions. Endo- and exothermicity
provides thermal and/or pressure feedback to some processes.
Finally, the properties of the mixture, such as the acoustic velocity
and thermal diffusivity, can affect the response of the system to
localized heat release.

Fig. 27. Mean total kinetic energy derived from PIV data as a function of time after the
end of compression. The unshaded bars show the average measured autoignition
delay time at Tc (cid:3) 840 K and pc (cid:3) 37 bar The shaded bars represent the time from the
end of compression to the maximum pressure, where the darker portions indicate the
time when visible emissions were recorded using the CMOS camera. The ignition data
correspond to four fuels: 1-hexene, primary reference fuel blend of 90% isooctane and
10% n-heptane (PRF90), methylcyclopentane and isooctane, in order of increasing
ignition delay time. (reprinted from [240] with permission of Springer Science).

Pcompression ratio versus diluent composition change, reacting ver-
sus non-reacting mixtures, and so on. Therefore, the reaction cham-
ber conditions, for example the presence and magnitude of thermal
gradients, are not identical from one study to the next. Further-
more, variability in each experiment can also affect interpretation
of the results for techniques that utilize line-of-sight averaging,
ensemble, or other composite methods. Absolute, quantitative tem-
perature measurements are challenging and the data currently
available, albeit for limited conditions and facility configurations,
are invaluable for the design of experiments and interpretation of
the resulting data, but uncertainties must be considered. Addition-
ally, all results to date have been one- or two-dimensional meas-
urements, although the data indicate three-dimensional flow fields
can be formed during RCM experiments. Within these caveats, the
results of the studies presented here suggest that for RCMs config-
ured to study autoignition chemistry by suppressing large scale
fluid motion, thermal boundary layers can grow to 5 mm thick dur-
ing the test period, and random fluctuations in temperature can be
lowered to less than 1%, with bulk and local gradients near 1(cid:1)10 K/
mm. Larger scale features associated with uncontrolled fluid
motion, like the vortex roll-up in non-creviced piston geometries,
have been identified with associated thermal gradients from 50 to
100 K/mm and temperature fluctuations of §2(cid:1)3%.

PSpecies measurements coupled with ignition delay time meas-
urements provide higher fidelity data for developing reaction theory
and for validation combustion kinetics. For example, excellent
agreement between experimental and model predictions for ignition
delay time have been demonstrated for a broad range of fuels and
conditions, as presented and discussed in Section 6. However, time-
resolved species measurements sometimes show significant discrep-
ancies between the model predictions and the experimental data,
even when the ignition delay times are in good agreement. Such dis-
crepancies indicate potential problems with the predictive certainty
of the models for important intermediates like small alkenes, as well
as trace species such as pollutants. Gas-smpling techniques have
matured in the past decade both with respect to the temporal fidel-
ity of the physical sampling hardware and with respect to advances
in the gas analysis. Multi-dimensional gas chromatography and

PVarious aspects of these features as they relate to RCM experi-
ments have recently been discussed by Grogan et al. [257] and
references therein, where a regime diagram was constructed to
parameterize the gas behavior during a test. This operating map,
which is depicted in Fig. 28, was formulated in terms of Damk€ohler
and Reynolds numbers (Da and Re, respectively), with demarcations
estimated to indicate transitions between various phenomena. The
Damk€ohler number used ignition delay time as the chemical time
scale (i.e., tT/tign), while the Reynolds number was parameterized
by the mean piston velocity and the bore of the reaction chamber. It
was assumed that laminar conditions in the test chamber are only
possible at very low Re based on diameter (of order or below unity),
although it should be realized that the transition is expected to occur
at higher Re [102], while creviced piston configurations can extend
this even further. The parameterization used for Fig. 28 requires
some adjustment for the wide range of machine configurations in
use today, covering those designed to investigate autoignition chem-
istry, as well as those used for turbulence-chemistry interaction
(TCI) studies, and this is an area of active investigation. The evolution
of various phenomena and their demarcation boundaries will shift
accordingly. Nevertheless, analogous diagrams have been created
for other experimental devices, e.g., [258,259], and are useful since
they can aid experimental design, for both machine arrangement as
well as selecting operating conditions.

PModern RCMs used to study autoignition chemistry are config-
ured to minimize non-uniformities and other physical effects such
as boundary layer growth, and thus tend to operate within the
region labeled 1 in Fig. 28. This region is bounded by the ‘compres-
sion’ limit (tign D tC), the ‘loss of adiabaticity’ limit (Dtign /tign<<1),
and the ‘mixed/detonation to deflagration, or DDT’ limit (f(xRe)).
RCMs designed to probe physical-chemical
interactions operate
intentionally outside of these boundaries. For instance, stratified
autoignition studies typically access the mixed ignition regime or
region 2, and TCI investigations operate in region 3.

PWhen expressed on an Arrhenius diagram, the limits for region
1 can be manifested roughly as shown in Fig. 29. Here, the bound-
aries indicate conditions where reliable autoignition chemistry data
can be acquired with relatively low uncertainties. Experiments are
typically conducted within this window via adjustments to c, ’, and
diluent:O2 ratio, in a manner similar to shock tubes. The locations of
these boundaries are somewhat facility dependent, being functions
of t50, surface area to volume ratio, etc., but normally ignition times
greater than 2 ms and less than 150 ms are within these limits. The
kinetic sensitivity of the reactive mixture can also shift the ‘mixed/
DDT’ limit to shorter or longer times, and this generally will not
coincide with other limits. Additional work to rigorously evaluate
these boundaries could benefit our understanding of autoignition
regimes.

Fig. 29. Representative Arrhenius plot for RCM ignition delay data of stoichiometric
isooctane/air mixtures at pc D 20 (§0.65) bar [62].

PAutoignition experiments typically use pressure-time measure-
ments as the primary diagnostic. Representative experimental traces
are presented in Fig. 30 for reacting and non-reacting tests using iso-
octane/air mixtures [62]. The air in RCM experiments is typically a
synthetic blend of O2 and N2/Ar and non-reacting tests are per-
formed by replacing the O2 with N2, since these gases have similar
thermo-physical properties. The non-reacting tests provide an indi-
cation of the heat loss or heat gain experienced during a particular
test, and can also be used to evaluate processes such as the evolution
and extent of preliminary exothermicity, e.g., LTHR or ITHR [260].

PIn Fig. 30 the parameters t0, t50, t1, tign, and Dp1 are identified.
The reference time, t0, is often specified as the location where the
pressure-time curve peaks during compression of a non-reacting
mixture, though some other definitions have also been used
[102,133]. The thermodynamic state conditions are typically evalu-
ated at this point. The time shown here does not necessarily corre-
spond to the end of piston travel, since at the elevated temperature
conditions there is significant competition between heat loss and
compression heating, so the pressure can begin to decrease before
the piston motion is completely arrested. The piston typically stops
moving 0.25(cid:1)3.0 ms after dp/dt becomes negative, but this can be as
long as 40 ms in some configurations. The parameter t50 is the time
required for the last 50% of the pressure and associated temperature
rise. This parameter is especially important for studies where highly
reactive fuels are investigated in order to avoid the ‘compression’
limit, since the pressure and temperature of the reacting gas are sig-
nificantly elevated near the end of piston compression. Low values
of t50 are thus essential for preventing fuel reactivity during the

Pcompression process, and also reducing uncertainties associated
with the evaluated thermodynamic state for a particular test condi-
tion. The time tign from the reference time is the induction period,
or ignition delay time, defined here where dp/dt is greatest. Studies
_
have also used a pressure-rise threshold or
OH emissions to mark
the main ignition point. The intermediate time interval, t1, is defined
based on the location of the inflection in the pressure trace, or the
peak of the derived heat release rate (HRR), shown in Fig. 30 normal-
ized by the lower heating value of the mixture, and may be observed
for mixtures where there is substantial LTHR. As seen in Fig. 30,
LTHR, which is quantified as the integral of the HRR curve during the
first-stage peak, and whose source is discussed further in Section 6,
generally involves a sharp rise in pressure, Dp1, while ITHR, which
can occur subsequent to, or without LTHR, involves a more gradual
rise in pressure that results from coupled self-heating processes, but
without a sharp inflection point preceding the main ignition.

4.2. Modeling

PA number of options exist for modeling RCM experiments, where
various levels of fidelity are used to account for facility influences
and/or physical interactions that occur during a test. As discussed
earlier, these interactions and influences can be moderate, like the
piston trajectory used within a device and the diffusive growth of a
laminar boundary layer, or they can be complex, with mixing and
transport processes spanning a range of length and time scales, as
with TCI studies. Realistic modeling of these along with detailed
chemical kinetic representations can be straightforward, or it can be
computationally intensive [261]. Detailed CFD studies conducted to
date have highlighted challenges associated with accurately describ-
ing the laminar-turbulent transitional flows that exist within RCMs,
and have indicated that low-fidelity turbulence models, e.g., Rey-
nolds Averaged Navier Stokes k-e, may be inadequate towards prop-
erly simulating this regime [148]. Few high-fidelity simulations have
been reported which can replicate the physical characteristics, i.e.,
fluctuations, experimentally measured in some RCMs, such as the
LIF measurements of [148], and further work using high-fidelity
multi-dimensional simulations such as DNS [261] would help
bracket physical phenomena. In many cases though, it is possible to
describe the systems in terms of a limited set of thermodynamic
parameters. These reduced-order models are generally classified as
either homogeneous or non-uniform, and are discussed in detail
next. The end of this section summarizes the state-of-the-art for
modeling RCM experiments.

P4.2.1. Homogeneous reactor models

PHomogeneous reactor models (HRMs) utilize the simplest
computational paradigm wherein the chemical
reactions are
assumed to proceed in a spatially uniform manner within the reac-
tion chamber where the temperature and chemical composition are
uniform, or at least that reactions are limited to a specified range of
locations such as the core gas outside the boundary layer. In this
case, only one state is needed to describe the reaction progress. Very
limited physical
interactions can be implemented with this
approach, and generally only specific facility effects of piston com-
pression and heat losses are taken into account.

assume spatial averaging across the thermal gradient that exists
between the walls of the reactor and the hot gases so that the time-
integrated thermodynamic state of the mixture corresponds to a vol-
ume-averaging of the gas within the reaction chamber. This is simi-
lar to a mixture-average temperature that results from application
of the ideal gas law based on the measured pressure and volume of
the chamber. The heat loss coefficient in [119,139] was determined
based on non-reacting tests using inerts including air, and was
adjusted for different operating conditions, as well as times past the
end of compression. They did not consider the compression process
within their simulations, and utilized single-step kinetics for the
autoignition chemistry. Halstead and co-workers [262,263] followed
a similar approach for their HRM where heat loss was also included
as a linear term. The coefficients were determined empirically cover-
ing a wide range of conditions via non-reacting experiments, and
expressed in terms of Reynolds and Grashof numbers. The piston
compression process was incorporated within their analysis using
simplified expressions for the measured piston trajectory. The
compression process was segregated into three constant velocity
intervals, where different values were used to approximate the
acceleration, coasting and deceleration periods. Halstead et al.
[262,263] implemented a more complicated kinetic scheme using
11 reactions and 12 species, commonly referred to as the Shell
model, which was able to replicate ignition delay times and two-
stage ignition behavior seen in their RCM tests.

PA number of later studies also employed an energy balance
formulation, e.g., [264(cid:1)266], however, it was subsequently demon-
strated that volumetrically-averaged state conditions do not realisti-
the dominant, chemically reactive conditions
cally represent
experienced within the reaction chamber [267,268]. As such, signifi-
cant discrepancies can arise between the HRM and experimental
measurements.

PKeck and co-workers [269,270] were the first to hypothesize that
autoignition chemistry within the reaction chamber proceeds at
faster rates within the hottest portion of the mixture, especially
when Arrhenius kinetics are applicable. This hypothesis followed
from analyses of end gas autoignition within spark-ignited systems,
e.g., spherical combustion vessels, and coincided with their develop-
ment of piston crevices as a means to suppress the corner vortex
development during compression, thereby segregating the colder
boundary layer gas from the adiabatic core. Their HRM was con-
structed as an adiabatic reactor where the experimental pressure
history was used, in conjunction with isentropic relations, to pre-
scribe an effective time-varying volume, for both the piston com-
pression and the subsequent delay periods. Their expression is
presented in Eq. (2), where this is derived by rearranging Eq. (1)
with the heat loss term eliminated, and the ideal gas equation of
state used to convert the volume rate change term into a pressure
rate change.

Here, the total number of moles in the reactor is approximated

using an isochoric assumption, facilitated by setting dp/dt|exp D 0,
beyond the point of noticeable exothermicity in the test, defined as
dp/dt|exp > 0.

PThe adiabatic core approach has been the basis of most HRMs uti-
lized over the past two decades, and is also frequently employed to
estimate the thermodynamic state conditions for experimental tests,
i.e., Tc, especially for comparison against other datasets, through
Arrhenius diagrams. This is achieved by rearranging Eq. (2) with the

PNumerous iterations and extensions have been proposed to the
adiabatic core HRM for simulating RCM experiments. Minetti and
co-workers [80] employed a simplified expression wherein the com-
pression process is modeled using a frozen chemistry assumption,
i.e., there are no appreciable changes in composition or exothermi-
city, while the delay period is modeled under isochoric conditions.
Wooldridge and co-workers [271,272] similarly used a frozen chem-
istry approximation during compression, with this assumption also
extended into the ignition delay period in order to derive an effec-
tive thermodynamic state (i.e., Teff, peff), which accounts for heat
loss or exothermicity due to ITHR, as well as non-uniform ignition
events, as discussed in Section 5. In this approach, the model simula-
tions can then be initiated using the effective temperature and pres-
sure as the starting point, with an isochoric condition applied.

PMohamed [273], Curran et al. [274] and others, e.g., [275] demon-
strated experimentally and computationally, respectively,
that
under some conditions chemical reactivity during piston compres-
sion can significantly alter the autoignition process and thus induc-
tion times, even if the ‘compression’ limit, as defined in Section 4.1,
is not strictly reached. This provides motivation to account for gas
reactivity during compression within the simulations. Tanaka et al.
[276] divided the compression process into two segments where the
piston was assumed to travel at constant velocity through the major-
ity of its displacement, with a constant rate of deceleration applied
at the end of compression. The assumed velocities were selected to
match representative experimental compression histories. During
the constant volume period an analytical model was employed to
simulate the growth of the thermal boundary layer within the reac-
tion chamber and this was converted into an effective volumetric
expansion of the adiabatic core. The constants for the boundary layer
model were adjusted in order to match experimental measurements.
Mittal and co-workers [268] used a similar approach for the com-
pression process, but added a third phase of constant acceleration at
the start of the piston motion. During the delay period they used
measurements of representative non-reacting tests with the O2
replaced with N2, to directly specify the dp/dt|exp term in Eq. (2). This
technique tends to provide very good replication of the pressure fall-
off due to heat loss without repeated tuning of the model constants.
Gallagher et al. [277] and Healy et al. [278] utilized a similar method
where non-reacting mixtures were compared directly against

Preacting ones, but in a coarser fashion the effective volumetric
expansion was approximated by two or three constant velocity seg-
ments. Details concerning the implementation of these empirical
approaches are discussed in Sung and Curran [39] where compari-
sons are made to simplified simulation methods, e.g., adiabatic,
constant volume.

PRefinements to the adiabatic core HRM since its inception have
enabled more realistic accountings of piston compression and heat
loss, and the influences that they have on the thermodynamic state
of the reacting mixture, and thus, the progress to ignition. Some
techniques however, can increase the number of tests that must
be conducted during an experimental campaign to adequately pre-
scribe the heat loss behavior for each mixture considered. W€urmel
and co-workers [146,279] demonstrated via CFD simulations and
experiments that the pressure decay during the delay period can be
significantly altered due to the composition of the test mixture and
operating condition used, e.g., nitrogen versus argon as the diluent,
so that many additional tests can be required. One approach to
address this, as demonstrated by Lee and Hochgreb [141], is to for-
mulate a multiple-zone, physics-based adiabatic core model that can
be applied, after proper validation, to any variety of mixtures and
test conditions. This model, a schematic of which is presented in
Fig. 31, utilizes a single zone to simulate the chemical kinetics, while
expressions for the growth of the thermal boundary and mass
flow to the piston crevice are used to account for the various
physical processes that occur during the delay period.

PIn this model the growth of the boundary layer depends on the
thermal gradient at the reaction chamber wall; a non-dimensional
expression was suggested in Lee and Hochgreb [141] to prescribe
the temperature profile across the boundary layer. The rate of mass
flow to the crevice depends on the pressure dynamics between the
crevice and the reaction chamber, and it was assumed that the flow
is fast enough such that no pressure differential can be established
between the crevice and the main volume of the chamber. Lee and
Hochgreb's formulation also assumed that the mass entering the
crevice is immediately cooled to the wall temperature due to the
large surface area to volume ratio that exists there. This model
inherently implies that the corner vortex is completely suppressed
by the piston crevice so that only diffusive heat loss occurs within
the reaction chamber. Brett et al. [115] extended this model for tests
exploring methane autoignition in an opposed-piston geometry.

PGoldsborough et al. [280] developed enhancements to this multi-
ple-zone HRM wherein many of the original assumptions were
relaxed based on observations from detailed CFD simulations. For
instance, the growth of the boundary layer in the reaction chamber
was determined using a one-dimensional discrete application of the
conduction equation so that the imposition of an assumed thermal

Pgradient was not required. The flow rate into, and cooling of the gas
in the crevice were based on more physically-realistic approxima-
tions using Reynolds- and Nusselt-based correlations, respectively.
An approach was also formulated to account for the additional gas
transfer into the crevice volume that occurs when there is significant
preliminary exothermicity, e.g., LTHR, during a test [152]. As dis-
cussed in Section 2, these processes can substantially increase
apparent ignition delay times under some conditions [85].

PAnother advantage of physics-based HRMs is that the boundary
layer growth and penetration into the core can be directly monitored
for each simulated condition. At long delay times the thickness of the
thermal layer can become significant and the ‘loss of adiabaticity’
limit may be reached, even if the reacting gas is not quenched. Fur-
thermore, within the NTC regime the ignition delay time may be
influenced by reactivity within the boundary layer, particularly after
this region has sufficiently grown [140]. More detailed models may
be appropriate under these conditions, as discussed next. Finally,
once properly parameterized, physics-based HRMs can be used
without the need to conduct non-reactive tests at each condition, so
that their implementation can be more cost-effective.

P4.2.2. Non-uniform reactor models

PFor RCM tests that explore non-uniform autoignition phenom-
ena, there is a need to account for spatial variations within the reac-
tion chamber. Reduced-order, non-uniform reactor models are one
approach, where these are less computationally expensive than for
instance, large eddy simulation (LES) techniques. Such models can
be classified as stratified or stochastic, where the former are focused
on describing large-scale, one- or two-dimensional gradients, such
as those due to non-uniform heating systems or diffusive boundary
layer growth, while the latter are focused on small-scale, e.g., parti-
cle-by-particle inhomogeneities, such as those caused by turbulent
mixing. Stratified reactor models, like the ‘onion-layer’, or ‘concen-
tric-balloon’ model, have been applied to simulate RCM conditions
in just a few studies [165], but there is an extensive literature on
their application to modeling stratified autoignition in HCCI engines
[281,282]. Potential exists for their use in various RCM studies,
including autoignition chemistry investigations to address and
reduce uncertainties under NTC conditions and long ignition delay
times where the measurements can be significantly affected by
boundary layer gradients [267,283,140]. Furthermore, this approach
may be beneficial for tests employing advanced diagnostics (e.g.,
line-of-sight absorption spectroscopy), where boundary layer gra-
dients have the potential to influence the measurements so that
undertaking representative simulations could be important for
interpreting these datasets.

PStochastic reactor models (SRMs) have recently been utilized
to simulate conditions where turbulence effects are influential.
Section 2 discussed ways that turbulence can be generated in RCMs
for TCI studies. In addition, turbulent conditions have the potential
to develop within the reaction chamber as a result of residual
motion from the filling process or at the boundary layer interface,
and due to compressive strain within the core, as discussed in
[102,170]. Analogous scenarios can be found in shock tubes and flow
reactors, and are sometimes taken into account when simulating
such non-idealized tests [41]. In reduced-order SRMs, it is generally
assumed that statistical homogeneity exists, meaning that the local
distributions of composition and temperature are identical at all
points throughout the reaction chamber. These models are limited
in the extent to which they can capture processes which are depen-
dent on both small-scale and large-scale phenomena, such as mild
ignition and knock, as discussed more in Section 5.

PStrozzi et al. [126] employed a transported probability distribu-
tion function (PDF) approach, where molecular diffusion, chemical
production, heat transfer and exothermicity perturb the statistics
based on the local conditions. Monte Carlo methods can be used to

air mixtures where various molecular mixing sub-models are used in the SRM simula-
tion. ‘Lt’ indicates the assumed integral length scale. Tc D 945 K, pc D 38.4 bar, ’ D 1,

Psolve the PDF equation, and Strozzi et al. employed 1000 individual
particles to achieve statistical convergence. A variety of approaches
were investigated for addressing the micro-mixing process, and
some results illustrating the influence of different sub-models are
presented in Fig. 32. Particle heat transfer was conducted using a
random walk approach and this was coupled to a mean convection
term using the IC engine-based, Woschni correlation [284]. In their
initial implementation, the authors assumed that the gas in the reac-
tion chamber was initially homogeneous, so that all of the heteroge-
neities generated during a test were due to heat transfer alone.

PIhme [170] formulated an SRM in order to simulate the amplifica-
tion of (presumed) velocity and scalar fluctuations due to piston
compression. This reactor model captures the influence of rapid
compressive strain on the production of inhomogeneities during a
test, which is one way that small-scale non-uniformities can be gen-
erated. The model employed rapid distortion theory (RDT) to
describe the evolution of initial distributions. RDT is an approach,
based on linear analysis, for estimating how turbulent fields are dis-
torted due to large-scale velocity gradients, bounding surfaces, etc.,
which are applied for a time shorter than the ‘turn-over’ time of the
flow. The effects of heat transfer were not taken into account directly
by altering the probability distribution function, for instance, but
were approximated during the delay period using a volumetric
expansion model [276] which was easily coupled to the RDT
approach. A Lagrangian Fokker-Planck method was employed to
account for interactions amongst thermal and compositional inho-
mogeneities via turbulent mixing and diffusion. Closure was
obtained via a k-e formulation and an Interaction by Exchange with
the Mean micro-mixing model. Due to the framework used for this
reactor model, initial PDFs for velocity, temperature, and composi-
tion, must be specified, and there is some ambiguity associated with
the initialization. Representative simulation results presented in
[170] covered parametric variations with the reactor model to high-
light influences of initial PDF specification, as well as machine oper-
ating characteristics, e.g., compression ratio, on the initiation and
progress of autoignition for a syngas mixture. Although the neces-
sary dimensionality is missing from this SRM, similar features,
including shifts in ignition timing and global rates of pressure rise,
were observed between the computed results and RCM measure-
ments under conditions where mild ignition is present, i.e., com-
bined deflagrative/autoignitive combustion,.

Padiabatic, strong behavior. While a range of reduced-order models
has been utilized to simulate RCM experiments, a number of open
questions remain regarding ‘best practices’, including the extent of
uncertainties associated with various HRM approaches and the level
of detail necessary to minimize these for various reacting systems,
as well as how to most appropriately represent complex physical-
chemical inateractions in a computationally-tractable framework.
Though some attempts to compare different HRM methodologies
have been undertaken [280,285], conclusions drawn are dependent
on the thermodynamic state conditions, operating characteristics of
the RCM hardware, and fuel/oxidizer/diluent composition. Some
mixtures and state conditions are more sensitive to facility effects,
such as the rate of piston compression and pressure decay experi-
enced during the delay period, or inhomogeneities that may be pres-
ent, while other reacting systems are less so. For instance, although
Curran et al. [274] demonstrated a significant influence of the com-
pression history on computed ignition delay times for stoichiometric
n-heptane/air mixtures, if the low temperature chemistry portion
of a model has much higher uncertainties associated with it than
the intermediate temperature chemistry component [286], and the
experiments are conducted at intermediate temperatures, achieved
via compression from near-room temperature conditions, then the
predictions could be perturbed in a complicated manner if the com-
pression history is simulated. To date there are no definitive metrics
or rigorous guidelines that can be used across a wide range of RCM
conditions. Furthermore, there are still questions that remain
regarding the use of reduced-order models towards comparing data-
sets between different RCM facilities, as well as other experimental
apparatuses. This is an area needing more investigation.

5. Studies of physical-chemical interactions

PWhereas studies of autoignition chemistry represent the primary
focus of modern RCM investigations and are discussed in detail in
Section 6, some important work has considered physical-chemical
interactions, often in specially-designed RCM configurations, as
described in Section 2. Phenomena covered in this section include
stratified autoignition, turbulence-chemistry interactions (TCI), mild
ignition and knock. These classifications refer to a range of possible
couplings between chemical reaction and transport. Stratified auto-
ignition and TCI generally occur across different length/time scales,
but are directly relevant to combustion processes in operating
engines; for example, they can be used to control rates of heat
release and pollutant formation in LTC schemes [162]. Mild ignition
in RCMs, shock tubes and flow reactors has been observed for many
years, and is associated with convolved deflagrative/autoignitive
processes. It is identified as undesirable in studies of autoignition
chemistry since it complicates the interpretation of datasets, and
thus the evaluation and validation of chemical kinetic models
[287,288]. The fundamental causes of mild ignition and its mitiga-
tion are of continued interest. Finally, knock can lead to unwanted
engine noise, and result in structural damage and engine failure if
not properly eliminated via operating conditions, fuel selection and/
or combustion chamber design [289].

PIn this section, highlights of RCM studies of chemical-physical
interactions are presented, starting with autoignition under strati-
fied thermal and/or compositional conditions, followed by results of
work focused on turbulence-chemistry interactions. RCM contribu-
tions to understanding the origin of mild, strong and mixed-mode
ignition are presented next, and the section ends with a discussion
of RCM investigations of knock phenomena.

Por sequential autoignition events that result have been explored by
Iida and co-workers [163(cid:1)167] using an optically accessible RCM, in
order to understand the influences of bulk thermal and composi-
tional stratification, as well as effects of fuel structure. Pressure and
piston position data were recorded during and post compression,
and chemiluminescence images were acquired using a high speed
camera (10,000 frames per second or 10 kilo-frames per second
(kfps)) with a resolution of 0.67 mm/pixel (improved to 0.40 mm/
pixel in later tests). The details of their specialized experimental
configuration were described in Section 2. The reactive mixtures uti-
lized a very lean condition (’ D 0.17), while comparisons were made
to non-reactive tests with air. For all of the reactive tests, autoigni-
tion and the accompanying heat release occurred during the com-
pression stroke, and this altered the piston dynamics by extending
the seating duration, i.e., t50 increased from 25 ms to 35 ms for
unreactive versus reactive experiments.

PThe tests utilized dimethyl ether (DME), n-heptane, n-butane
and isooctane as the fuels, with the first two selected due to their
greater LTHR at the compressed conditions. For cases where there
was no compositional stratification, the results indicated that DME
and n-heptane are less influenced by thermal stratification, since
ignition timings and rates of pressure rise were similar across the
various conditions. The chemiluminescence images for these fuels
demonstrated non-uniformities across the reaction chamber as the
mixtures became more stratified, there was delayed autoignition in
the cooler regions of the reaction chamber. Contrary to this behav-
ior, n-butane and especially isooctane experienced more noticeable
differences in the pressure measurements where the ignition tim-
ings were shifted (n-butane, earlier; isooctane, later) and the rates
of pressure rise were reduced. The thermally stratified mixtures
were seen to initiate heat release earlier, and had an overall slower
heat release process. The chemiluminescence data for these fuels
also highlighted changes in the spatial development of autoignition,
again starting in the hotter portion of the charge and propagating
from there. For the conditions explored in all of these tests autoig-
nition is expected to initiate in the hottest portions of the mixture,
since the NTC behavior is rather weak due to the very lean condi-
tions. Differences in observed fuel response may be attributed to
the fact that DME and n-heptane are more reactive and therefore
autoignite earlier in the compression stroke, under conditions
where the compressed pressure and temperature are lower and the
magnitude of stratification across the reaction chamber is also
lower.

PFor the compositionally stratified cases, only DME was used as
the fuel, and the tests revealed that the interactions between ther-
mal and compositional stratification are complex. For instance, at
the DT (cid:3) 25 K condition, when the thermal and compositional gra-
dients were in the same direction (positively correlated), the mix-
ture ignited faster, while at the DT (cid:3) 40 K condition, when the
thermal and compositional gradients were in opposite directions
(negatively correlated), the mixture ignited faster. These features
are probably influenced by the behavior of the NTC region for this
fuel/air mixture and thus not readily generalized. When simulated
EGR was used, the positively correlated mixture ignited earlier and
faster, while the negatively correlated mixture ignited later and took
longer to complete the heat release process. Nevertheless, these
characteristics have implications for controlling the autoignition and
heat release rates for conventional and advanced combustion sys-
tems. For instance, under most fuel injection scenarios the thermal
and compositional gradients are negatively correlated due to the
vaporization enthalpy of the fuel.

Pthe evolution of autoignition and interactions with flame front prop-
agation under low and high turbulence conditions, respectively,
where a range of advanced optical diagnostics were employed,
including schlieren, PIV, PLIF and chemiluminescence (described in
Section 3). Turbulent motion within the reaction chamber of RCMs,
like in IC engines, can be quite different than in canonical configura-
tions like swirl-stabilized flames, due to the presence of fluid(cid:1)wall
interactions and the ensuing generation of shear/mixing as well as
thermal inhomogeneities.

PStrozzi et al. [122,126,215] investigated TCI under conditions
where the turbulent fluid motion and succeeding heterogeneities
were generated solely due to vortex roll-up within a square cross-
section RCM that did not utilize creviced pistons. PIV measure-
ments indicated a maximum turbulent kinetic energy of 0.5 m2/s2
within the core of the reaction chamber at 2 ms before the end of
compression. Pressure and piston position data were recorded dur-
ing and post compression, and chemiluminescence imaging was
acquired using a high speed camera (5 and 9 kfps)) with a resolu-
tion of 0.128 and 0.256 mm/pixel, respectively. Stoichiometric mix-
tures of methane/air were used in [122,126,215] at compressed
temperatures and pressures of Tc D 926(cid:1)945 K, pc D 40 bar, respec-
tively. Under these conditions no NTC behavior was expected, so
the hotter regions within the reacting mixture are most reactive.
The chemiluminescence data revealed the presence of ignition ker-
nels at various locations within the mixture where these evolved
during the heat release process. The data were post-processed
using a binarization, front-tracking algorithm to determine local
propagation velocities, with these corrected to account for thermal
expansion of the burned gases. Analysis of the measurements indi-
cated that some fronts propagated with high apparent velocities,
near 40(cid:1)80 m/s, while others had velocities that were moderate,
near 5 m/s. The laminar burning velocity at the experimental
conditions was estimated to be near 1 m/s. The results suggested
different modes of front propagation, and so the PLIF-derived tem-
perature fields were analyzed with the theory of Zeldovich [248],
Gu et al. [249] and Sankaran et al. [290]. Fairly good correlation
was found for the delineation between spontaneous autoignition
and deflagrative propagation, except during the later stages of heat
release, while these modes were significantly dependent on the
local gradients in temperature and reactivity. Strozzi et al. [215]
concluded that under the conditions they investigated, the low-
intensity turbulent fields generated in their RCM only influenced
the initial development of heterogeneities and thus ensuing global
heat release rates, but had little, if any effect on the front propaga-
tion behavior, e.g., there was no wrinkling or smoothing of the
fronts.

PBen Houidi et al. [291] followed this with investigations of TCI
under NTC conditions. Lean (’ D 0.4) n-hexane and an n-heptane/
methylcyclohexane blends were used at pc D 12 and 15 bar, respec-
tively, covering Tc D 700(cid:1)900 K. As with earlier work in this facility
[215], they found that the reaction progress was not significantly
influenced by the local turbulence levels, with most of the propaga-
tion done by compression waves having velocities on the order of
40(cid:1)60 m/s, peaking near 1500 m/s. Both cool flame and hot ignition
fronts were visualized, and these were observed to initiate in regions
of highest reactivity, which could be either coldest or hottest zones,
or even both.

PGuibert et al. [113,240] investigated high turbulence conditions
in their RCM using a reaction chamber that had a contracting
geometry (relative to the bore of the swept volume), where perfo-
rated mesh plates were placed at the chamber's entrance. The
intent of their work, like Strozzi et al. [122,126,215], was to identify
various combustion modes during autoignition, and investigate the
influence of turbulence scale and intensity on the combustion
modes observed. They altered the turbulence field by changing the
mesh hole size, while maintaining similar blockage ratios (»40%).

PThe smallest holes generated higher levels of turbulence with
accompanying faster rates of heat loss and pressure drop after the
end of compression. PIV measurements indicated peak turbulent
kinetic energies near 70 m2/s2 within the core of the reaction
chamber, at 1 ms after the end of compression [240]. This is two
orders of magnitude greater than the environment within the RCM
used in [215]. Pressure and piston position data were recorded
during and post compression, with chemiluminescence imaging
acquired at 6 or 12.5 kfps using a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm/
pixel. Histograms of luminosity were generated from the chemilu-
minescence data, and bimodal features used to identify the pres-
ence of flame fronts. Flame curvatures and PDFs were temporally
tracked in order to quantify apparent displacement speeds of the
flames, and how these can be wrinkled during the autoignition
process. In Guibert et al. [113], propane and isooctane were used
as the fuels at ’ D 0.45 and 0.35(cid:1)0.50, respectively, with com-
pressed conditions near Tc D 920 K and pc D 35 bar. In Guibert et al.
[240] four fuels were investigated including isooctane, 1-hexene,
primary reference fuel blend of 90% isooctane / 10% n-heptane
(PRF90) and methyl cyclopentane, with ’ D 0.40 at compressed
temperatures and pressures near Tc D 840 K and pc D 38 bar At the
stoichiometries and state conditions of these studies, NTC behavior
is relatively weak so hotter regions within the reacting mixture are
expected to be the most reactive.

PGuibert et al. [113] classified two modes of combustion during
their tests. For the propane/air mixture, combustion initiated at a
single location and spread in a front-like manner. For the isooc-
tane/air mixtures however, autoignition started at multiple loca-
tions, where these spread throughout the reaction chamber and
eventually merged. For both fuel mixtures, at the leanest conditions
the displacement speeds increased slightly with time due to com-
pression of the unburned mixture by the expanding burned gases.
For the richest isooctane/air mixture, the increases in displacement
speed were more significant, while the reacting charge transitioned
to volumetric autoignition before the front could consume the
unreacted gas. The authors concluded that in the presence of signif-
icant turbulent fluid motion and thermal inhomogeneities, kinetic
interactions can be important during all stages of combustion. For
instance, once initiated, autoignition can enhance the level of inho-
mogeneity and thus more intensely couple physics and chemical
kinetics, inducing volumetric and front-like combustion. Further-
more, with increased fuel loading the ignition times are faster and
heat release is more significant, and this leads to a stronger
coupling between turbulence and chemistry.

PGuibert et al. [240] followed this work by more rigorously quan-
tifying the influence of turbulent fluid motion on autoignition, with
the fuels studied covering a wide range of ignition delay times,
tign D 7(cid:1)178 ms. During the induction period the authors observed
the turbulent kinetic energy of the mixture dissipated significantly
due to wall shear. Furthermore, the PIV measurements highlighted
vortex-flame-autoignition interactions. For instance,
in the 1-
hexene/air mixture, which had the shortest ignition delay times,
regions confined by eddies in the flow experienced thermal run-
away of the chemical reaction, and thus spontaneous volumetric
ignition occurred over a small region of the test section. The igni-
tion kernels significantly increased the local temperature, and thus
thermal gradient, since the characteristic time of turbulent mixing
dissipation was longer than the chemical time scale. The enhanced
temperature gradient then favored the development of a propaga-
tion front, where the initially wrinkled front became smooth due to
Lewis number effects. Differently, the isooctane/air mixture, which
had the longest ignition times, exhibited autoignition in a more vol-
umetric manner, with slight spatial spreading, and this was due to
thermal inhomogeneities initially present in the reaction chamber
that were homogenized by the local turbulent heat dissipation rates
during the induction period.

5.3. Mild ignition

PMild ignition and its causes have been extensively studied in
shock tubes, while historical and recent work has also been under-
taken using RCMs. Mild ignition refers to a convolved deflagrative/
autoignitive process, but generally in a regime where turbulence
interactions are weaker than the conditions targeted by, for exam-
ple, the UPMC's RCM [113,240], i.e. weaker than the high turbulence,
stirred uniform reaction regimes. Mild ignition has also been
identified and labeled as ‘weak ignition’ in some literature. These
events are characterized by the appearance of a single, or multiple
flame kernels at various locations throughout the reaction chamber,
which grow into distinguishable flame fronts. The fronts are gener-
ally not cool flames (which are defined in Section 6), but are associ-
ated with chemiluminescence due to high temperature chemistry.
Mild ignition can transition to strong, i.e., volumetric autoignition,
or detonation in shock tubes, for instance when the end gas, or
unburned mixture is sufficiently heated by the compressive action
accompanying the initial rise in pressure. This evolution can lead to
complex phenomena, including the generation of pressure waves,
detonation and knock, which are discussed in the next sub-section.
Preliminary exothermicity is often noted in the pressure and chemil-
luminescence emission during mild ignition events, but this is differ-
ent than LTHR or ITHR. LTHR and ITHR, which are described more in
Section 6, usually comprise about 2(cid:1)15% of the heating value of the
fuel, while pre-ignition heat release (PIHR) due to mild ignition and
its associated deflagrative processes can be much larger, with frac-
tions approaching 20(cid:1)80% [292]. Measured ignition delay times dur-
ing mild ignition events are generally shorter, indicating a difference
in reactivity relative to the nominal compressed conditions, for
example due to a hot spot. Finally, mild ignition can be associated
with high variability or scatter in the measurements depending on
the local conditions [288], and this highlights the stochasticity that
can accompany the process. There can be noticeable differences
between measurements in facilities where mild ignition is present,
indicating an influence of machine operating characteristics.

PEarly studies by Teichmann [293] and Leary and co-workers
[69,106], using their optically accessible RCMs, identified impor-
tant factors governing the rise of mild ignition events, including
the presence of thermal inhomogeneities. Taylor et al. [69] ruled
out fuel condensation due to piston compression as a cause,
but noted an influence of fuel loading, where leaner mixtures (e.
g., ’ < 0.5) did not exhibit deflagrative events. Haskell and co-
workers
catalytic effects of
suspended contaminant particles within the mixture, via dust or
within the fuel itself. Furutani et al. [238] identified flame-like
structures in their optical experiments, for both cool flame heat
release and hot ignition, where these were presumed to develop
from thermal heterogeneities.

[96,294] highlighted potential

P5.3.1. Shock tube observations

PA brief discussion of important shock tube studies of mild igni-
tion is presented here to supplement and provide insight into work
undertaken on this subject using RCMs. The first detailed measure-
ments of mild ignition were conducted by Saytzev and Soloukhin
[295] using an optically accessible shock tube where they employed
schlieren block photography and moving picture techniques for
tests using H2/O2 mixtures, as well as inert gases. The tests covered
pc D 1(cid:1)3 bar and Tc D 900(cid:1)1700 K. At lower temperatures, they
identified distributed combustion centers in the test section located
away from the endwall, which were seen to develop as a result of
perturbations in the pressure and temperature fields within the gas
behind the reflected shock wave. Local non-uniformities were
observed in the inert gas tests; based on the resolution of their
images and some simplifying assumptions, temperature variations
were estimated to be on the order of §10 K, or §1%. Voevodsky and

PSoloukhin [296] used similar conditions, pc D 0.5(cid:1)4.0 bar and Tc
D 800(cid:1)1700 K, again with H2/O2 mixtures where they demonstrated
that as pressures increased and temperatures decreased the ignition
process transitioned from strong to mild. Chemical kinetic analysis
was used and the transition was shown to correspond with the shift

OH to degenerate-

branching, or intermediate-temperature chemistry via

POppenheim and co-workers [297(cid:1)299] used a square cross-
section, optically accessible shock tube to perform measurements
employing stroboscopic,
laser-schlieren imaging techniques to
visualize spatial variations in the ignition process. In tests with
undiluted, stoichiometric H2/O2 mixtures [297] covering pc D 0.23
(cid:1)1.98 bar and Tc D 900(cid:1)1350 K, they noted a transition from
strong to mild ignition at higher pressure and lower tempera-
tures, similar to Voevodsky and Soloukhin [296]. Localized exo-
thermic centers were observed predominantly in the stagnant
regions of the tube near the corners, where the reflected shock
wave interacted with the boundary layer leading to bifurcation
and the development of inhomogeneities [297]. Flame propaga-
tion was initially slow, with practically no pressure rise, but the
reaction fronts transitioned to detonation waves as the tests pro-
gressed. Meyer and Oppenheim [297] argued that the shift from
strong to mild ignition phenomena is predominantly thermo-
physically based, influenced by the significant increase in ignition
delay times at lower temperatures. For instance, as the degener-
ate branching controlled regime is approached for H2/O2 mix-
tures, induction times become longer and the tests are therefore
more sensitive to temperature variations. Hot spots that form are
able to react at significantly faster rates than the surrounding gas.
At the same time, as a consequence of the longer induction
period, transport phenomena acquire greater influence and this
leads to the appearance of small flame kernels. Meyer and Oppen-
heim [297] constructed a regime diagram based on temperature
and pressure, and they identified an empirical limit of (@t/@T)p D
¡2 ms/K which demarcated the transition from strong to mild
ignition in their facility. This limit was found to roughly correlate
with the transition from chain- to degenerate-branching ignition
at their experimental conditions.

PVermeer et al. [299] and Cheng and Oppenheim [298] extended
this work covering n-heptane/O2/Ar, isooctane/O2/Ar and eleven
blends of CH4/H2/O2/Ar, respectively. For the n-heptane and isooc-
tane mixtures a mild ignition transition was found to occur when
(@lnt/@T)p D ¡0.012 and ¡0.008, respectively, while the methane/
hydrogen mixtures transitioned near (@t/@T)p D ¡0.2 to ¡0.7 ms/K,
depending on the CH4:H2 ratio. Vermeer et al. [299] argued that the
hydrocarbon fuels were better characterized by (@lnt/@T)p gradients
instead of by gradients of (@t/@T)p due to a coupling that exists
between the pulse duration of the exothermic centers and the induc-
tion times, which they speculated was not correlated for the fuel
blends containing H2.

PAdditional experimental insight covering a wider range of fuels,
including hydrogen, n-heptane,
isooctane, PRF blends, benzene,
methanol and methyltertbutyl ether (MTBE), as well as n-decane,
a-methylnaphthalene and DME, and at higher pressures was pro-
vided by Adomeit and co-workers [300(cid:1)304]. They used a square
cross-section, optically accessible shock tube rated to pc (cid:3) 20 bar,
and a metal shock tube rated to pc (cid:3) 50 bar, and employed shadow-
graph imaging techniques combined with pressure measurements
and records of CH* emissions (430.7 nm), as well as data from thin-
film heat transfer gauges. Their measurements highlighted spatial
details of the convolved deflagrative/autoignitive processes, and the
transitions to detonation in their devices. Ciezki and Adomeit [300]
identified an initial, slowly rising pressure and no merging of the
reflected shock and reaction front, while they noted the transition
from strong to mild ignition was not abrupt for n-heptane, as was

Pseen with other fuels, e.g., hydrogen [297], but occurred over a range
of temperatures, where the deflagrative portion of ignition was usu-
ally followed by detonation with short transition times. Pfahl et al.
[302] further described characteristics of mild ignition within their
tests covering three diesel-relevant fuels, where they noted the high
cetane rated fuels, n-decane and DME, more readily transitioned
from deflagrative behavior to detonation, while higher tempera-
tures, e.g., Tc > 960 K, were required for a-methylnaphthalene to
make this transition. Fieweger et al. [303] constructed regime dia-
grams for benzene and isooctane based on temperature and pres-
sure, similar to Meyer and Oppenheim [297], where demarcations
were identified between strong and mild ignition with the strong
ignition cases classified solely based on whether or not the ignition
process transitioned to detonation, even though many of the pres-
sure records contained noticeable PIHR.

PBlumenthal et al. [301] complemented this work with studies
where they identified a range of multi-dimensional phenomena for
mixtures using hydrogen, n-heptane and isooctane as the fuels.
Specifically, they studied the evolution of flame kernels starting at
locations far from the endwall, along with ensuing deflagration and
detonation waves. The development of spherical and planar waves
was described in detail, and correlations between the visual records
and recorded data from pressure transducers and photomultiplier
detectors were noted. Blumenthal et al. [301] distinguished mild
ignition from strong ignition such that flame kernels were absent
from strong ignition events. Based on this definition they concluded
that over at least some portion of the thermodynamic range
explored, all three fuels experienced mild ignition. Under some
conditions, the mixture located near the transducer was completely
consumed by the propagating deflagrative front, while in others
the pressure rise due to the flame caused the gas in this region to
volumetrically autoignite. n-Heptane was found to always transi-
tion to detonation. The behaviors observed in their tests were sum-
marized by again creating a regime diagram using (@t/@T)p plotted
as a function of temperature, with demarcations identified for
strong ignition, planar ignition structures, and spherical structures.
The strong ignition limit was correlated with a value of ¡2 ms/K,
similar to Meyer and Oppenheim's boundary for hydrogen [297],
but unlike Vermeer et al. [299], the derivative of the natural log
was not used for the hydrocarbon fuels. For the results shown in
Blumenthal et al. [301], only the low pressure (pc D 3 bar) hydrogen
tests yielded strong ignition behavior over an extensive portion of
the temperature regime studied.

PFinally, Fieweger et al. [304] discussed the influence of mild
ignition events on data acquired for autoignition chemistry stud-
ies. For most of their dataset they identified deflagrative phe-
nomena, where these transitioned to volumetric ignition and
detonation under some conditions. Shortened ignition times rel-
ative to purely chemical kinetic processes were observed. Some
times were estimated to be a factor of 10 faster due to the non-
uniform, multi-dimensional deflagration processes. These phe-
nomena can challenge the interpretation of data from a chemical
kinetic perspective [305]. Fieweger et al. [304] argued however,
that for tests that transition to detonation, the only interactions
between the gas at the endwall and the deflagrating front were
due to pressure couplings, so by assuming adiabatic compression
of the end gas during the induction period to account for exo-
thermicity in other portions of the reacting mixture, shifts or
advancements in ignition timing could be taken into account.
Formulating comparisons in this manner however, as discussed
earlier, requires (at a minimum) access to pressure-time histo-
ries for such datasets, e.g., [306], and while it may improve com-
parisons with homogeneous
it
introduces additional experimental and modeling uncertainties.
As such, a constrained reaction volume concept for shock tubes
in an attempt to eliminate mild
has been developed [307]

reactor model calculations,

Pignition phenomena, whereby fuel is loaded only near the end-
wall of the driven section to minimize exothermic effects.

PThese shock tube investigations identified complex physical and
chemical dynamics that influence mild ignition phenomena, where
sensitivities to inhomogeneities in the mixture, impurities, wall
properties, and the generation of local hot spots were highlighted.
More recent experimental works have extended these insights
[308(cid:1)311], and detailed simulation techniques have been used
where the development and evolution of non-uniformities caused
by gas dynamic processes, especially boundary layer interactions
with the reflected shock wave and shock bifurcation, have been
studied [86,312(cid:1)314]. These phenomena become very important at
long induction times. Gas dynamics are generally suppressed in
RCMs due to the lower rates of gas compression employed, as
highlighted in Section 2. However, inhomogeneities which facilitate
mild ignition events can be generated by other mechanisms in RCMs
and shock tubes.

P5.3.2. RCM measurements

PWooldridge and co-workers have conducted the most extensive
work to date using an RCM platform to study mild ignition. They
investigated syngas (i.e., H2/CO blends) [204,272] and isooctane
[213,315,316] as fuels. The configuration utilized for their work
incorporated a fully accessible optical endwall to enable high speed
imaging of the entire reaction chamber. Walton et al. [272] studied a
wide range of syngas blends covering H2:CO ratios from 0.25 to 4,
with Tc D 855(cid:1)1051 K and pc D 7.2(cid:1)26.7 bar They used diluent:O2
ratios near atmospheric conditions, with most of the mixtures near
’ D 0.4. The pressure records for much of the data revealed notice-
able PIHR, followed by a transition to volumetric ignition, but with-
out detonation. The imaging data indicated that deflagration fronts
propagated across the mixture starting at one or multiple exother-
mic centers in the reaction chamber. The visible emissions were
noted to correspond with the gradual increase in pressure, preceding
the main ignition event. These features can be seen in Fig. 33 where
results from a representative test are illustrated. The transition for
volumetric ignition occurs here after »40% of the total combustion
reaction enthalpy is released. For the leanest cases, no PIHR or
chemiluminescence front were observed. Like Fieweger et al. [304],
Walton et al. [272] suggested for modeling and analysis purposes
the deflagrative portion of the ignition process, in particular PIHR,
could be taken into account via empirical means, similar to

Fig. 33. Representative pressure-time history illustrating mild ignition behavior

insert chemiluminescence image illustrates a deflagrative process emanating from
localized autoignition near the upper portion of the reaction chamber. The timing of
this image is indicated on the pressure trace, while the transition to volumetric igni-
tion is identified on the dp/dt curve. (adapted from [272] with permission of Elsevier).

Pargument by Fieweger et al. [304], but specifically by establishing
an effective thermodynamic state for each test, as discussed in
Section 4. They proposed a time-integrated average condition,
beginning from the point of maximum piston compression to the
time of maximum pressure rise rate. The measured ignition delay
times in this work exhibited a change in activation energy below Tc
(cid:3) 1000 K, where this was in disagreement with a detailed chemical
kinetic model used for comparison. The authors argued the discrep-
ancy could be due to uncertainties in the model, most likely associ-
ated with CO + H

OH.

PWalton et al. [213] investigated mild ignition using isooctane as
the fuel. They covered a narrow range of state conditions with Tc
D 900(cid:1)1020 and pc D 9(cid:1)15 bar, but used a wide range of fuel load-
ings with ’ D 0.2(cid:1)2.0 and diluent:O2 levels from 1.4 to 5.9. As with
the syngas work, some of the tests exhibited mild ignition and some
did not. Effective thermodynamic state conditions were again
derived from the measurements, and comparisons with a chemical
kinetic model were shown. Using the chemiluminescence records,
the speeds of the reacting fronts were estimated and compared with
theoretical values, as proposed by Zeldovich [248]. For the theoreti-
cal calculations a temperature gradient of 3 K/mm was assumed,
which corresponds to bulk gradients that have been experimentally
measured in RCMs, as discussed in Section 3. The (@t/@T)p values for
the calculations were based on the experimentally measured results,
where these were observed to be reasonably close to predictions by
the kinetic model. Poor agreement however, was seen between the
measured and theoretically-calculated front speeds, with the mea-
sured values substantially greater than theoretical ones. On the
other hand, the experimental velocities were found to correlate
fairly well with fuel mole fraction. The influence of thermal diffusiv-
ity was also considered, and it was argued that mixtures with higher
diffusivities should be less susceptible to mild ignition since local
non-uniformities created during gas compression can be more effec-
tively homogenized before localized ignition takes place. This
hypothesis was evaluated using comparisons to select conditions
reported by Fieweger et al. [304], and agreeable trends were noted.

PAssanis et al. [315] investigated spark-assisted autoignition, or
what could be considered as ‘near’ mild ignition conditions, where
isooctane was again used as the fuel. For this study a local hot spot
was generated via high temperature plasma deposition using a con-
ventional spark plug located on the circumferential wall of the RCM
reaction chamber. The timings of the spark discharge were targeted
to occur at the end of the first quartile of the chemical induction
period. The spark discharge energy was kept constant between each
test. Compressed temperatures and pressures covered Tc D 942
(cid:1)1012 K and pc D 7.9(cid:1)9.6 bar, with ’ D 0.2(cid:1)0.99 and diluent:
O2 D 3.76(cid:1)7.47. Effective thermodynamic state conditions were
derived from the measurements, as per Walton et al. [272], in order
to account for PIHR in the data traces. Visual records and pressure
measurements were made, similar to the previous works. The
behaviors of the front propagation process under spark-ignited con-
ditions were found to be comparable to mild ignition seen in the
non-sparked, or spontaneous ignition tests studied in Walton et al.
[272] and [213]. For instance, some mixtures were determined to be
incapable of sustaining the imposed flame front, while others could
easily do so. The authors labeled the former conditions as ‘below
flammability limit’. This categorization is analogous to the incapacity
of, or propensity for mixtures to exhibit flame propagation during
spontaneous ignition tests, as noted in early work by Taylor et al.
[69]. The front velocities for each mixture were again determined
using the chemiluminescence records, and these values correlated
very well with the calculated adiabatic flame temperatures, in a
manner equivalent to correlations observed with fuel mole fraction
[213].

PMansfield and Wooldridge [204] further explored the delineation
between strong and mild ignition for syngas mixtures by conducting

Ptests in the University of Michigan RCM covering Tc D 950(cid:1)1150 K
and pc D 3(cid:1)15.2 bar, with two fuel loadings, ’ D 0.1 and 0.5. A blend
ratio of H2:CO D 0.7 was used with diluent:O2 D 3.76. To correlate
their data the authors constructed regime diagrams using pressure
and temperature, analogous to the work of Meyer and Oppenheim
[297]. Results for two equivalence ratios were presented on two
plots. For the higher ’ condition, data from two previous shock tube
studies, [301] and [317], were included in the diagram. Three theo-
retical approaches were employed in an attempt to explain the
demarcation between strong and mild ignition regimes. The first
analyzed the classical and extended second explosion limits for
H2/O2 mixtures, as suggested by Voevodsky and Soloukhin [296]. At
low pressure the demarcation agreed well with these limits, how-
ever at higher pressures the agreement was not good. The second
method was based on the thermal sensitivity of the mixture, as sug-
gested by Meyer and Oppenheim [297]. The gradient of ignition time
with respect to temperature, (@t/@T)p, was calculated for the H2:
CO D 0.7 mixture and isopleths were presented at the two equiva-
lence ratios. Values of ¡700 ms/K and ¡40 ms/K provided reasonable
agreement with the transition for the ’ D 0.1 and 0.5 mixtures,
respectively. The third methodology compared the laminar flame
speeds of the mixtures to the rates of reaction front propagation,
where it was identified that the diffusive flame velocity must be
large enough for the flame to propagate across the reaction chamber
before the upstream, or unburned mixture can autoignite. This crite-
rion was initially proposed by Zeldovich [248], and revisited by Gu
et al. [249] and Sankaran et al. [250]. The reaction front propagation
rates were estimated using an assumed thermal gradient, e.g., (dt/
dx)¡1 D ((dt/dT) £ (dT/dx))¡1, where this accounts for influences of
molecular transport. It was postulated heterogeneous deflagration is
more likely to be observed under conditions when the laminar flame
speed is much faster than the rate of sequential autoignition, or reac-
tion front propagation rate. Isopleths of presumed dT/dx were pre-
sented on the regime diagrams and these contours can be seen in
the pressure-temperature diagram presented in Fig. 34. For both fuel

tion for H2/O2 and syngas/air mixtures at ’ D 0.5. The strong ignition limit is shown as
the hashed area. Isopleths of thermal sensitivity of the ignition delay time calculated
using the reaction mechanism of Li et al. [318] are shown as solid lines. Isopleths of
ignition delay time calculated using the same reaction mechanism are shown as dot-
ted lines. The strong ignition limit appears to correlate well with a critical value of
thermal sensitivity. (reprinted from [204] with permission of Elsevier).

Pstructure and autoignition chemistry, (b) flame-autoignition interac-
tions, and (c) gas dynamic evolution after knock initiation.

P5.4.1. Fuel structure and autoignition chemistry effects

PTaylor et al. [178] acquired some of the first chemiluminescence
images and pressure records using an RCM to study the influence of
fuel structure and fuel loading on end gas autoignition and the
isooctane, benzene, triptane
development of knock. n-Heptane,
(2,2,3-trimethylbutane), and n-butane were used in mixtures with
air at ’ D 0.6(cid:1)1.5, while the effects of tetraethyllead doping were
also investigated. The compression ratio and initial temperature
were varied to cover a range of compressed conditions, pc D 20
(cid:1)30 bar and Tc D 750(cid:1)1050 K. Most of the tests utilized spontaneous
ignition of the gas mixture, though some tests employing forced
ignition, via a spark plug located in the cylinder wall, were also con-
ducted. Virtually all of the spontaneous ignition cases proceeded
through mild ignition, with localized flamelets observed across the
reaction chamber, where these compressed the unburned mixture
to autoignition, with this followed by oscillations in the pressure
trace. Due to the limitations of the data acquisition system, simulta-
neous visual and pressure measurements were not possible for most
of the tests, and there were significant shot-to-shot variations
caused by the thermal inhomogeneities within the reaction chamber
[106]. Nevertheless, Taylor et al. [178] discussed the influence of fuel
structure, and progress of heat release from the flamelets before the
initiation of knock.

PAffleck and Fish [71] conducted one of the earliest detailed RCM-
based investigations into the causes of knock where they employed
stoichiometric mixtures of 2-methylpentane/air at pc D 20 bar and
Tc D 653, 743 K. The lower temperature is within the low-tempera-
ture chemistry regime where the timing of first-stage heat release,
t1, is close to the main ignition point, tign. The higher temperature is
near the transition to NTC chemistry where there is a noticeable
time lag between the two stages of ignition, as was identified for the
isooctane/air data presented in Fig. 2. They compared the behavior
of spontaneous ignition events with forced ignition events, and clas-
sified the behaviors as either non-knocking or knocking. A range of
knocking behavior was achieved from light to heavy. The spark
probes were centrally located in the reaction chamber and they
acquired emissions records via spectral filtering techniques, while
they also sampled the product gases with analysis conducted using a
gas chromatograph coupled with a flame ionization detector.

PThe emissions records identified OH* at 306.4 nm, and there were
lines associated with the metals that had been removed from the
reaction chamber walls, e.g., nickel, especially during knocking con-
ditions. Under spontaneous ignition conditions OH* emission was
visible, but weak, while under spark-ignited and knocking condi-
tions the OH* emission intensity grew significantly. The GC analysis
identified both hydrocarbons and oxygenates as the organic prod-
ucts resulting from spontaneous ignition. C2 hydrocarbons were
the major constituents, along with smaller yields of propylene,
isobutene, isopentane, hexenes and benzene. Oxygenates included
acetone, butanone, propionaldehyde,
isobutyraldehyde, acrolein,
methacrolein, 3-methyloxetan, 2,2-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 2,4-
dimethyltetrahydrofuran, methyl vinyl ketone, and larger saturated
and unsaturated ketones. Under sparked conditions with no or mini-
mal knock, no oxygenates or products typical of first-stage ignition
were formed in detectable concentrations. However, as the intensity
of knock increased, products associated with spontaneous ignition
were observed with increasing concentration. The results supported
the idea that knock in IC engines is primarily related to autoignition
of the end gas, as opposed to DDT phenomena.

PGriffiths and Nimmo [179] investigated the influence of fuel
structure by comparing the knocking tendencies of n-butane and
isobutane using stoichiometric mixtures with argon as the diluent,
at pc D 10 bar and Tc D 900 K. The mixtures were not ignited by a

Fig. 35. Generalized regime diagram for combustion modes indicating transitions
between strong and mild ignition (reprinted from [319] with permission of Elsevier).

Ploadings, it was found that thermal gradients near 5 K/mm, identi-
fied as a critical value of thermal sensitivity, correlated well with the
demarcation between the strong and mild ignition regimes.

PFinally, Mansfield et al. [316] extended their analysis to mixtures
with isooctane as the fuel. Experiments were conducted covering Tc
D 740(cid:1)1125 K and pc D 3(cid:1)30 bar, while focusing on ’ D 0.25 and 1.0,
with diluent:O2 ratios near atmospheric levels. A second RCM was
used in this work which had different operating characteristics (e.g.,
pneumatic/hydraulic actuation vs. pneumatic/impact actuation), in
order to complement the data. Both configurations had full optical
access through the endwall, and high speed imaging of the tests was
conducted along with measurements of pressure. Regime diagrams
were constructed using pressure and temperature, while data from
two previous shock tube studies ([299] and [304]) were included for
comparison. Again, theoretical analyses based on Zeldovich [248],
Gu et al. [249], and Sankaran et al. [250] were used to explain the
transition to mild ignition at low temperatures and high pressures.
The thermal gradients required to facilitate mild ignition were simi-
larly estimated to be near dT/dx D 5(cid:1)10 K/mm, and this gave good
agreement between the three datasets.

PGrogan et al. [257] and Im et al. [319] have proposed similar
regime diagrams based on Damk€ohler and Reynolds number scaling
that can be used as guides when conducting tests under conditions
where mild ignition is possible. Fig. 35 from Im et al. [319] utilizes
two ignition Damk€ohler numbers, namely integral scale Dal and mix-
ing scale Daλ, the turbulent Reynolds number, and includes a sensi-
tivity parameter, K, for the ignition delay which is based on the prior
work by Zeldovich [248], Gu et al. [249] and Sankaran et al. [290].
This regime diagram was supported by data from [204] and by
recent computational studies of syngas autoignition [292,320]
where mild ignition due to local hot spots was investigated. As seen
in Fig. 35, strong or volumetric ignition is predicted to occur when
the mixture is dominated by turbulent mixing with low reactivity or
low Dal, and when the mixture is dominated by reactivity, regardless
of Reynolds number. Between the limit defined by the sensitivity
parameter Dal D K2 and Dal D 1, the diagram predicts mixed or
weak (i.e., mild) ignition will occur. Fig. 35 was proposed to serve as
a general guideline to identify when combustion systems, not only
within RCMs, are controlled by autoignition versus controlled by
flame propagation, and this highlights the utility of fundamental
RCM investigations.

5.4. Knock

PRCMs have been used as a well-controlled platform to study
knock under both spontaneous ignition, as well as forced ignition
conditions, i.e., generated from a spark or other ignition source. The

Pspark, but proceeded through spontaneous ignition. The authors
acquired pressure-time histories (200 kHz) and visualization data
through the endwall, using high speed photographs recorded at 6
kfps. Under the conditions they explored, the n-butane mixtures
were more reactive, with measured tign approximately half of the
value of the isobutane mixtures. The data for both fuels indicated
the existence of localized flame kernel development and propaga-
tion, along with associated PIHR. As discussed previously, these pro-
cesses can evolve due to thermal non-uniformities within the
reaction chamber. The authors found that the n-butane mixtures
more easily transitioned to rapid heat release where a greater por-
tion of the reaction enthalpy was released simultaneously, after
which acoustic waves with large amplitude ensued. For the isobu-
tane mixtures, most of the reactants were consumed by propagating
flamelets by the time chain-thermal explosion occurred so that no
gas dynamic phenomena ensued.

PGriffiths and co-workers [74,180,181], subsequently investigated
the thermokinetic interactions leading to the development of knock
in three related spontaneous ignition studies. They sought to better
understand how the chemical kinetic evolution of ignition influ-
enced the development of gas dynamics within the reaction cham-
[180] studied stoichiometric mixtures of
ber. Schreiber et al.
n-heptane/air at pc D 8 bar, Griffiths and Whitaker [181] utilized lean
n-pentane/air mixtures (’ D 0.5) at pc D 12.8(cid:1)14.8 bar, and Griffiths
et al. [74] used n-pentane/air mixtures over a wider range of stoichi-
ometry (’ D 0.6, 0.7, 1.0) at two initial pressure ranges yielding
pc D 7.9(cid:1)8.4 and 13.8(cid:1)14.8 bar A range of compressed temperatures
was targeted covering the transition from low temperature chemis-
try to NTC chemistry, i.e., Tc D 650(cid:1)950 K for n-heptane, and Tc D 690
(cid:1)820 K for n-pentane, where the diluent gas composition was modi-
fied to achieve these conditions. The transition from low tempera-
ture chemistry to NTC behavior for the n-heptane and n-pentane
mixtures occurred near Tc D 740(cid:1)760 K. Pressure-time histories
were acquired (200 kHz, in the critical interval of interest) and
accompanied by single-shot chemiluminescence photographs of the
n-pentane tests, taken at various times during the first and second
stages of heat release. Spectral filters distinguished spatial locations
associated with CH*, C2* and CH2O*. Filtered Rayleigh scattering was
used in Griffiths and Whitaker [181] to ascertain the relative tem-
perature distribution across the reaction chamber at successive
times during the autoignition process. In all of the n-pentane tests,
thermal inhomogeneities were identified within the reaction cham-
ber at the beginning of the induction period, and this was ascribed
to the rollup vortex generated in their flat piston configuration
[74,181]. The lowest temperatures outside the boundary layer were
located at the center of the reaction chamber (at around 1 ms after

Pthe end of compression), and were approximately 50 K cooler than
the surrounding gas. For the n-heptane tests, most of the pressure-
time data indicated the presence of substantial PIHR.

PFor the two fuels, covering a range of stoichiometry and pressure,
the measurements revealed at the lowest compressed temperatures
there was minimal gas dynamic development at the point of main
ignition. However, as the compressed temperatures increased, pro-
ceeding through the point of minimum tign, i.e., entering the NTC
region as seen in Fig. 36a, the behavior transitioned to intense pres-
sure ringing, or knock. This became severe at the highest tempera-
tures, as seen in Fig. 36b. The emissions records suggested there
were differences in the predominant chemistry associated with the
final stage of knocking reaction, as compared to conditions where
knock was not observed. For instance, at Tc D 722 K without knock,
the degree of uniformity in the chemiluminescence records implied
_
chemical reaction continued to be driven by H
O2 reactions late into
the main heat release. On the other hand, at Tc D 792 K with heavy
knock, the second stage of ignition which was induced close to the
wall of the reaction chamber, as a consequence of the preceding
interactions between the chemical kinetics and fluid mechanics, was
able to develop very rapidly to hot ignition through an early transi-
€
O atom chain branching. At these conditions, there was a dra-
tion to
matic growth in activity over an interval that was neither uniform
spontaneous ignition nor smooth flame development. Griffiths and
co-workers [74,181] argued that their results suggested that the
development of knock is connected to the competition between

heat release, with the latter leading to knock. The production of H

is favored at lower temperatures, and the stronger pressure depen-
_
dence of this reaction suggests the H
O2 propagation route is sus-
tained to higher temperatures when higher pressures prevail.

PTanaka et al. [189], in a study similar to Griffiths and Whitaker
[181], investigated knock development from unforced ignition using
an optically accessible RCM. They used n-heptane as the fuel with
diluent:O2 D 3.76(cid:1)5.64 covering a range of stoichiometry (’ D 0.38
(cid:1)2.0). In their configuration, the fuel was injected directly into the
reaction chamber, after which heated O2 and diluent gases were sup-
plied. The compression process was initiated after a dwell time of
300 s, which suggests thermal and compositional stratification may
have been present at the start of piston compression. Three com-
pression ratios were used to cover pc D 9.8(cid:1)14 bar and Tc D 678
(cid:1)736 K. High speed images were acquired (9 kfps) using a Bowditch-
style piston, and laser extinction measurements were made via a
He-Ne laser directed through the side wall. The imaging measure-
ments indicated that the spontaneous ignition process was not uni-
form, due to gradients generated by their uncreviced piston, and

Pperhaps the mixture preparation process. The authors found some of
the tests produced strong knocking conditions, as a result of thermo-
kinetic interactions, while others did not. They created a regime dia-
gram as a function of compressed temperature, stoichiometry and
extent of dilution, where the resulting transition between non-
knocking and knocking behavior corroborated the findings of Grif-
fiths and Whitaker [181], while mapping the behavior over a much
wider range of test conditions.

P5.4.2. Flame(cid:1)autoignition interactions

PHayashi et al. [182] used an optically accessible rapid compres-
sion expansion machine (RCEM) to investigate flame-autoignition
interactions where a spark plug located in the cylinder wall was
used to force ignition. The spark timing was varied from 60 to 120°
before TDC (i.e., 12(cid:1)25 ms before the end of compression), where
tC (cid:3) 40 ms. They used mixtures of n-butane/air with a narrow range
of stoichiometry, ’ D 0.9(cid:1)1.1, at compressed conditions (without
spark) near pc D 20 bar and Tc D 650(cid:1)800 K. High speed color photo-
graphs (3 kfps) and schlieren images (100 kfps) were acquired dur-
ing heavy knocking events. The color images showed a blueish flame
produced near the spark which expanded in a circular fashion,
increasing in brightness as the pressure increased. When knock
started, the unburned region flashed white and expanded into the
blue-colored burned region, after which the whole reaction chamber
became white. This was followed by radiation indicative of soot. The
schlieren images revealed the flame propagation through the mix-
ture, until the point where the end-gas autoignited, followed by
pressure waves into the unburned and burned regions. The wave
speeds were estimated to initially be near 1300(cid:1)1500 m/s, which
was greater than the sonic velocity of the mixture. As the waves
reflected at the far cylinder wall, the propagation magnitude was
reduced to the sonic speed.

PP€oschl and Sattelmayer [168] followed this work by investigating
the influence of large-scale thermal stratification on knock, also
using an optically accessible RCEM. They used PRF69 with air at
stoichiometric proportions. A range of compression ratios was
employed to achieve compressed conditions near pc D 15(cid:1)20 bar
and Tc D 750(cid:1)900 K. The mixture was thermally stratified before
compression by means of a non-uniform heating system, so a tem-
perature difference of DT D 10(cid:1)20 K was achieved from one side of
the reaction chamber to the other. No piston crevice was used in
their machine, but the authors conjectured only small-scale turbu-
lence was generated during compression, though no accounting for
piston-induced bulk fluid motion was made. Pressure-time histories
were recorded, along with high speed imaging (87.6 kfps) through a
Bowditch-style piston and via fiber optics integrated into the end-
wall (250 kfps). Spontaneous and forced ignition were explored
where the latter was achieved by a single spark plug positioned at
different locations on the endwall. The three arrangements of the
spark allowed the authors to investigate the influence of igniting the
mixture in the cooler or hotter portions of the charge.

PFor the spontaneous ignition conditions it was observed that
when ignition started in the hotter portion of the mixture, reaction
fronts propagated through the unburned gas with velocities near
50(cid:1)200 m/s for the cool flame, and near 500 m/s for the hot ignition.
The observations were considered indicative of a stratified, or
sequential autoignition process, which can propagate at much
greater velocities than diffusive/transport limited, flame processes,
as discussed in previous sections. Under these conditions, there was
no generation of gas dynamic waves within the reaction chamber.
For the forced ignition conditions, the authors found severe knock-
ing could most easily be generated when the mixture was sparked in
the cooler portion of the charge. Under this scenario the spark-
ignited flame could interact with the evolving autoignition front
leading to the development of a detonation wave with velocities
near 1400 m/s. The pressure waves could be reflected and focused at

Pthe nearby convex wall, and then passed through the reactive gas
mixture that had high concentrations of radicals and intermediate
species, where a bidirectional coupling of the pressure wave and
heat release could develop. Such a coupling mechanism has been
discussed extensively in the literature, and is often identified as
shock wave amplification by coherent energy release, or SWACER
[321].

PKatsumata et al.

[183] used an optically accessible RCM
(tC (cid:3) 5 ms) to investigate forced ignition conditions where a spark
probe was inserted into the reaction chamber to generate a spark
near the cylinder wall, or in the center of the reaction chamber. The
spark was timed to occur during the compression stroke. They used
a range of PRF blends from 0 to 90, at stoichiometric concentrations
in air, and varied CR and Ti to achieve a number of compressed con-
ditions covering Tc D 600(cid:1)900 K and pc D 20(cid:1)30 bar Both schlieren
imaging (45 kfps) and direct photography techniques (180 kfps)
were used. The schlieren imaging revealed effects of LTHR in the end
gas on flame propagation, specifically wrinkling of the flame. In both
spark configurations, they observed SWACER features as spontane-
ous ignition was induced near the walls of the reaction chamber,
similar to the observations of P€oschl and Sattelmayer [168]. It should
be noted that SWACER has also been identified in recent LES studies
of knock and superknock [26], and this highlights the similarity of
the physics within RCMs and those in IC engines.

PWang and co-workers [184(cid:1)186] also investigated knock under
both spontaneous and forced ignition conditions using an optically
accessible, single-piston RCM. isoOctane was used as the fuel and
this was blended at stoichiometric proportions with either argon
[184] or nitrogen [185,186] as the diluent. Pressure data were
recorded at 100 kHz, while high speed images were recorded at 45
or 288(cid:1)360 kfps, respectively. Higher resolution was used under the
lower frame rate conditions, e.g., 0.1 mm/pixel versus 0.45 mm/
pixel, respectively. Wang et al. [184] studied the evolution of knock
for situations where combustion is initiated locally due to random
suspended particles or thermal non-uniformities, i.e., a hot spot. The
nominal compressed conditions were Tc D 930 K and pc D 20 bar, on
the high temperature side of the NTC region. The ignition timing
observed during the tests, if due to hot spot initiation, suggested a
local temperature about 2(cid:1)3% greater than the surrounding gas. The
authors reported that out of hundreds of tests performed, only a few
initiated inhomogeneously, and they argued this behavior was simi-
lar to the sporadic nature of superknock. The visual images indicated
three distinct stages of combustion. After initial flame kernel forma-
tion in the adiabatic core, a deflagration phase ensued where the
flame propagated through the bulk mixture with a velocity near
11 m/s. As the flame neared the cylinder wall, the end gas autoig-
nited, and within a period of 20 ms a detonation front formed, and
the detonation front then propagated around the circumference of
the reaction chamber with a velocity close to 3100 m/s (Mach
number D 5.5). Since the Chapman(cid:1)Jouguet detonation velocity was
estimated to be near 2300 m/s, the authors concluded this front was
a strong detonation wave. When the remaining unburned mixture
was consumed by the detonation front, the waves were reduced to
the sonic velocity with pressure oscillations that continued for 3 to
5 ms. The combustion behavior observed in the RCM tests was
argued to be similar to superknock, where the timings of deflagra-
tion and autoignition kinetics must match so a detonation front can
be initiated at just the right time in the cycle; otherwise, the end gas
autoignition wave is too weak and leads to only sonic waves.

PQi et al. [185,186] followed this work to better understand and
quantify the requirements necessary for detonation within the reac-
tion chamber. They used forced ignition conditions and employed a
commercial spark plug where the electrodes were extended to the
central portion of the reaction chamber. The spark timing was con-
trolled to within 1 ms after the end of compression. The compression
ratio of the machine was adjusted to cover Tc D 640 to 730 K, with

Ppc D 10(cid:1)30 bar The compressed conditions were used to represent
boosted spark-ignited engines, and differently from their earlier
study [184], are in the low temperature autoignition regime for iso-
octane, i.e., before the transition to NTC chemistry. In this regime
there are only small changes in ignition delay time due to pressure
differences; however, as the system proceeds to end gas autoignition
with associated compression heating, this feature becomes more
complicated, since the end gas is compression heated into the NTC
regime. The pressure and high speed imaging data of this work also
indicated three stages of combustion, with two modes of end gas
autoignition identified, both of which occurred in the near-wall
region. Sequential autoignition with no detonation was detected via
high-pass filtering of the image sequence where the luminosity var-
iations could be extracted. They found under these conditions, no
flame front propagated after autoignition, although the area associ-
ated with autoignition increased and small pressure waves were ini-
tiated. Detonation, on the other hand, was detected by extreme
pressure rise rates (6.5 kbar/ms), while the imaging sequences
revealed front propagation rates were close to 1900 m/s, near the
calculated Chapman-Jouguet detonation velocity of 1870 m/s. The
authors compared these measurements to the detonation theory of
Kalghatgi and Bradley [27] and found the results were consistent
with the deflagration-detonation regime diagram described by Gu
et al. [249]. They noted also, as P€oschl and Sattelmayer [168] did ear-
lier, that the pressure wave initiated due to autoignition could inter-
act with the reaction chamber wall, resulting in what they termed
shock wave reflection-induced detonation. The authors also corre-
lated their data to the thermodynamic conditions used in the tests,
and identified a threshold energy density of »17.5 MJ/m3 required
to initiate sequential autoignition, while »20 MJ/m3 was required to
initiate detonation under their experimental conditions.

PTanoue et al. [188] used an optically accessible RCEM to study
flame-autoignition interactions, and the transition from sub-sonic to
detonation waves during forced ignition events. n-Butane:DME fuel
blends were used at molar ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, where
DME was employed to decrease the knock resistance of the fuel.
Stoichiometric ratios were used and compressed conditions near
pc D 30 bar and Tc D 700 K were targeted. For their tests an ignition
plug was located in the cylinder wall and used to ignite the
mixture at 20° before TDC (i.e., 5.1 ms before TDC). Chemilumines-
cence images were recorded using a high-speed camera and local
flame propagation speeds were deduced via image-processing soft-
ware. The authors noted for all four fuel blends the initial flame
speeds were near 5 m/s, and an initial autoignition event close by
the ignition plug propagated circumferentially along the cylinder
wall at a much higher velocity, near 22(cid:1)28 m/s. This was interpreted
as a subsonic autoignition front. After much of the charge had been
consumed, a second autoignition event was observed far from the
ignition plug, where this propagated at a velocity near 130(cid:1)520 m/s,
which was close to that of a developing detonation front. The deto-
nation theory described by Gu et al. [249] was used to interpret the
data, and the knock intensities were demonstrated to be well corre-
lated to the non-dimensional ratio of the autoignition propagation
velocity and the sound speed. The data also agreed with the detona-
tion peninsula described by Bradley [322].

P5.4.3. Gas dynamic evolution

PKono et al. [107] used a single-piston machine with endwall opti-
cal access to investigate gas dynamic evolution initiated by forced
ignition where blends of diethyl ether / acetone (1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1.5,
1:4.5) were used in stoichiometric concentrations with air at pc D 19
bar and Tc D 446 K. The diethyl ether was selected for its two-stage
ignition behavior. The mixtures were spark-ignited from the side of
the cylinder opposite the pressure transducer. The pressure data,
recorded at 200 kHz, were analyzed using a Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) method after the main ignition event in order to discern the

Pcharacteristics of the acoustic energy. They found that the knock
intensity, represented by the total acoustic energy, was inversely
dependent on the extent that flame propagation had been com-
pleted before the onset of end-gas autoignition. Furthermore, most
of the energy was contained within the first tangential mode, corre-
sponding to knock typically seen in IC engines [323].

PQi et al. [187] also studied the evolution of gas dynamics under
forced ignition conditions within an optically accessible RCM. They
utilized a commercial spark plug located in the wall of the reaction
chamber with stoichiometric mixtures of isooctane/air where the
geometric compression ratio of the machine was set to 11.35. The
compressed temperatures were close to Tc D 645 K, while three com-
pressed pressures were investigated, pc D 17, 19.5, 23 bar The higher
pressures were used to increase the intensity of knock, which was
consistent with their later work [186]. The pressure measurements
were recorded at 100 kHz, and chemiluminescence measurements
were recorded at 288 kfps. The signals were post-processed just after
ringing onset, analyzing the frequency domain of both the pressure
records and the chemiluminescence images with a pixel-by-pixel
technique. The images provided spatial detail concerning local pres-
sure and temperature fluctuations since the pixel sensitivity cap-
tured small variations in luminosity. The FFT analyses indicated
discrepancies between the optical signals and the pressure records,
which the authors attributed to the recessed mounting of the trans-
ducer. In agreement with Kono et al. [107], the FFT analysis also indi-
cated, that the dominant acoustic mode of the gas dynamics was the
first tangential mode, while the second tangential mode was also
important, particularly at the intermediate pressure condition inves-
tigated. Via the high speed images, the authors also detected soot
incandescence near the wall of the cylinder, near the point of knock
initiation, which they hypothesized to be due to fuel pyrolysis within
the crevice volume caused by the intense pressure waves.

5.5. Summary

PThe stratified autoignition and turbulence-chemistry interaction
studies reviewed here emphasize the complicated evolution of auto-
ignition chemistry within non-uniform temperature and composition
fields, especially with fuels that exhibit NTC behavior. While past
work has been constrained in terms of diagnostic access and/or fidel-
ity (both spatial and temporal), and there can be challenges in gener-
ating desired scalar and velocity fields, there are opportunities for
future investigations that can leverage the benefits of RCM platforms.
One example is the concerted generation of data that can be used to
improve the robustness of high fidelity modeling techniques, such as
DNS and LES, for engine scenarios such as homogeneous charge com-
pression ignition and reactivity controlled compression ignition.

PThe shock tube and RCM-based mild ignition studies reviewed
here illustrate complex phenomena and how they can influence
experimental measurements of autoignition chemistry. Fundamen-
tal insight has been gained indicating that some fuels and mixtures
are more susceptible to the evolution of deflagrative behavior, while
the critical thermal gradient necessary to facilitate mild ignition
within mixtures appears to be very low, and even near levels that
have been experimentally measured within the adiabatic core of
well-controlled reaction chambers, i.e., those utilizing creviced pis-
tons. Based on this, it is evident that care must be taken when con-
ducting tests under conditions where mild ignition is possible, and
diligence should be used in identifying the existence, or absence of
such events.

PThe knock studies reviewed here underscore the complexity of
phenomena associated with knock initiation and development. The
findings highlight that knock fundamentals in RCMs closely repro-
duce those observed within operating IC engines, and potential
exists for investigating still-open questions related to knock
the
including the generation of

Pcharacterization of large- and small-scale structures, as well as the
ability to adequately model relevant processes for engine design
purposes. Experimental measurements under these extreme condi-
tions however, can be challenging. Kilohertz (and greater) imaging
and pressure diagnostics are necessary to allow access to very high
speed phenomena that occur during knock, while the thermody-
namic conditions and localized pressure spikes can lead to serious
equipment damage. Furthermore, observations of Qi et al. [187] raise
concerns that soot can form during heavy knocking tests with or
without forced ignition, and contaminate the surfaces of the reaction
chamber, particularly for undiluted, high pressure conditions. This
finding is relevant to performing autoignition chemistry studies at
high fuel loading conditions.

6. Studies of autoignition chemistry

PMuch of what we know today about autoignition chemistry has
emerged from RCM studies where the device time scales are ame-
nable to reaction time scales at relevant conditions, as described in
the Introduction. This section details the vast array of knowledge
developed, complementing other experimental platforms and cov-
ering a range of fuels using RCMs, progressing from discussion of
results for fuels with the simplest-structures, H2 and CO, to discus-
sion of systematically more complex fuel structures, specifically
alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, oxygenates and closing with a
discussion of real fuels and fuel additives. In this context, it is useful
to consider the series of reaction pathways leading to autoignition
at LTC conditions, typical for many fuels, which have been exten-
sively discussed in [324(cid:1)326], and are illustrated in Fig. 37. At tem-
peratures below about 1200 K, reactions with the fuel molecule,
RH, are usually initiated via abstraction of a hydrogen atom from
_
the fuel (R1). O2 and a variety of radicals, e.g.,
O2, can partici-
_
pate, yielding an alkyl radical,
O2, H2O,
and H2O2. In systems with low concentrations of active radicals,
the initiation reactions are thought to occur between the fuel and
_
molecular oxygen, which then forms a hydroperoxyl radical, H
O2,
as the product.

_
R, and products such as H

_
OH, H

PAt temperatures as low as 500(cid:1)600 K, the fuel-derived alkyl radi-
_
cals react rapidly with O2 to form alkylperoxyl radicals, RO
O (R2a),
which can lead, through various transformations as marked in (R3a)
and (R3b), to the formation of hydroperoxide species and hydroper-
oxyalkyl and other small radicals. These in turn can react with addi-
tional fuel molecules by metatheses in order to regenerate alkyl
_
radicals. This causes a propagation chain in which
OH radicals are
the main chain carriers. The formation of hydroperoxides is

adapted from [325].

Pimportant, because these species contain a weak O(cid:1)(cid:1)OH bond whose
breaking leads to the formation of two radicals, which can then react
again with fuel molecules to give further alkyl radicals. This so-called
degenerate branching induces an exponential acceleration of reac-
tion rates, leading to spontaneous autoignition, or explosion.

PCool flames and LTHR are often observed preceding the main
ignition event in this regime [61]. These cool flames occur at temper-
atures much colder than the adiabatic flame temperature of
the mixture, and are typically bluish in color, indicative of CH2O*
chemiluminescence [327]. In stratified mixtures, such as in HCCI
engines and diesel sprays [328,329] or fundamental experiments
[194,291,330,331], these flames can propagate via advective/diffu-
sive or compressive/advective/diffusive mechanisms. In homoge-
nous mixtures typical of RCM experiments, the observed emissions
are mostly-uniform, lacking defined spatial structure indicative of a
flame [332]. CH2O concentrations peak in the mixture as the local
temperature rises following the decomposition of ketohydroperox-
_
ides which produces multiple
OH radicals, followed by, for example,
_
OH D CH2O + H2O. This first stage of ignition is typically asso-
CH3
ciated with an increase in temperature of 50(cid:1)200 K, and is identified
as a sharp rise in pressure, e.g., Dp1, as marked in Fig. 30. After LTHR,
the reactivity slows in part due to a shift in equilibrium to the
reverse of (R5a), while the concentration of H2O2 increases due to H-
_
O2 radicals, as well as recombination
atom abstraction reactions by H
_
_
_
CH3. During that time, significant
reactions of H
O2 with H
O2 and
quantities of H2O2 accumulate while the pressure and temperature
slowly increase in the core because of non-branching exothermic
reactions. This slow rise in temperature after LTHR is termed inter-
mediate temperature heat release (ITHR), as indicated in Fig. 30. The
second-stage, or main ignition follows when the temperature and
_
pressure are sufficient for H2O2 to decompose into two
OH radicals,
causing the intermediate temperature degenerate branching. The
terms ‘cool flame’ and ‘first-stage ignition’ have been used inter-
changeably in historical RCM investigations, however we reserve
‘cool flame’ to designate the low-temperature propagating front,
e.g., [291,330,333].

_
O2 radicals are much less reactive than

PAt higher temperatures, e.g., 800(cid:1)1000 K, the formation of
alkenes via (R3c) and (R5b) competes with the isomerization reac-
tions, (R3a) and (R5a), as does the dissociation of alkylperoxyl radi-
cals via the reverse of (R2a). These aspects lead to a reduction in the
overall reaction rate, particularly since alkenes are stable and rela-
_
tively unreactive, and H
OH
radicals, and this gives rise to NTC behavior, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
This distinctive feature of many fuels presents a range of tempera-
tures within which global induction times increase, or at least
remain nearly constant, as the temperature increases. The competi-
tion between channels leading to low-temperature branching and
those producing less reactive products, such as alkenes and cyclic
ethers (R5c), accounts for (at least in part) the decrease in reactivity
of many fuels when the extent of molecular branching increases, for
example from n-butane to 2-methylpropane. Analogously, the
increase in reactivity when the length of the linear carbon chain
increases, for example from n-butane to n-pentane, results from the
larger number of sites at which internal isomerization reactions
(R3a, R7) can occur. In the NTC regime, self-heating of the system
can also play an important role, where this transitions from LTHR to
ITHR. The extent of preliminary exothermicity is typically lower at
higher temperatures, with Dp1 being smaller, and the time from t1
to tign longer. Reactions associated with ITHR are generally less well
understood, but the direct (i.e., concerted) elimination reactions of
_
RO
O2 + alkene/ether/carbonyl species (R3c), followed
by H

_
O leading to H
_
O2 D H2O2 + O2, are thought to be important [334].
PAt temperatures above the NTC regime, for instance, greater than
about 1000 K, the decomposition of fuel radicals into smaller alkyl
radicals and alkenes is the predominant pathway traversed by most
fuel radicals containing more than three carbon atoms. H-atom

Section 1, proceeds through a range of thermo-chemical states. As
such, even though a system may start at low to intermediate tem-
peratures, the coupled self-heating, including LTHR/ITHR, generally
results in conditions where higher temperature chemistry evolves,
_
e.g., H2O2 (+M) D _
OH, and this is criti-
cally important for the multiplication in radicals leading to high
_
temperature heat release, e.g., via CO +
H. This complex
evolution is responsible for the propagation of combustion in oper-
ating engines, and is well replicated in RCM experiments.

PStudies of autoignition chemistry can generally be classified
based on the fuels investigated. As indicated earlier, they are pre-
sented here in hierarchical order, starting with the smallest mole-
cules, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, followed by alkanes, alkenes,
cycloalkanes, aromatics, oxygenates, and finally full-boiling range
fuels and fuel additives. These structural classes represent the con-
stituents of most market fuels for stationary and transportation
applications, including natural gas, LPG, gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel
fuel. LTC of real fuels, which typically consist of hundreds to thou-
sands of components, proceeds through a cascade of fuel fragments
and intermediate oxygenated species that are also present during
the decomposition and oxidation of small fuels, such as hydrogen
and propene. As such, the combustion chemistry of small molecules
is not only relevant for their utilization as fuels themselves, e.g.,
within natural gas, but also spans the development of hierarchical
chemical kinetic models for complex fuels at LTC conditions.

PThis section guides the reader through the evolving understand-
ing of autoignition at LTC conditions, covering the pioneering work
of Affleck and Fish [70] as well as current state-of-the-art. Whereas
most investigations during the last century focused on trends
observed within conventional engine regimes [69,105,293], recent
activities are often undertaken to acquire rigorous measurements
which can be used to develop and validate detailed chemical kinetic
models covering a wide range of conditions. Particular attention is
devoted in modern studies towards minimizing uncertainties associ-
ated with the measurements, as discussed in [39], so that predictive
computational tools can be formulated to aid the design of new fuels
and advanced combustion engines. The primary focus of the review
in this section is on experimental findings of autoignition chemistry;
however, some attention is paid to the development and comparison
of chemical kinetic models using the experimental datasets, as well
as interpretations facilitated by the modeling results.

6.1. Hydrogen/syngas mixtures

PHydrogen is an important fuel, not only because there is potential
to generate hydrogen via electrolysis of water using renewable

Ppower, but also because hydrogen oxidation kinetics, as just
highlighted, are critically important in the combustion of all hydro-
gen containing fuels, and thus it is the foundation of all hierarchical
kinetic models. Most hydrogen is currently produced by steam
reforming of natural gas, or by the gasification of coal, biomass or
municipal waste, where the resulting synthesis gas (syngas) also
contains significant fractions of CO. Syngas can be utilized as a low
pollution fuel for both stationary piston- and turbine-based engines.
PThere have been a number of studies of hydrogen and syngas oxi-
dation in RCMs (e.g., [204,272,335(cid:1)341]), the conditions of which
are summarized in Table 2. Experiments with hydrogen can be chal-
lenging, due to the sensitivity of autoignition to the presence of gas
in-homogeneities
impurities, vessel contamination, and thermal
[305,342]. Early ignition and non-uniform (i.e., mild) ignition has
been observed in many historical studies due to such issues. Hydro-
gen explosion limits at low temperatures have previously been char-
acterized in terms of threshold first and second pressure limits,
beyond which no explosion occurs [343]. Between the first and sec-
ond explosion limits, i.e., the ‘strong ignition’ regime, autoignition is
_
controlled primarily by branching via
OH and very little
coupled self-heating can be found in the experimental pressure
records. However, at pressure conditions above the extended
second limit, the autoignition of hydrogen follows a degenerate
branching process and is controlled primarily by the formation and

H + H2O2, H
OH (+M).
Under these conditions, chemical energy release in the pre-ignition
period plays an important role, where the rates of pressure/tempera-
ture rise evolve from a relatively slow process, transitioning to rapid
heat release at the point of main ignition. The rates of heat release
are generally lower than in the strong ignition regime, and there is
often a detectable level of ITHR in experimental measurements
before the system explodes. These features have been classified in
historical literature as the ‘weak ignition’ regime.

PLee and Hochgreb [335] provided some of the first experimental
autoignition data for hydrogen significantly above the extended sec-
ond explosion limit. They identified ITHR in the pressure records at
their lower temperature conditions while none was present at
_
higher temperatures. A modification to the rate constant for H2 + H

D _
H + H2O2 was seen to improve kinetic model predictions compared
to the experimental measurements.

PMittal et al. [340,341] studied the autoignition of H2/O2/Ar/N2
and H2/CO/O2/Ar/N2 mixtures. H2 was replaced by CO in order to
investigate the effect of the change in relative concentrations of both
fuels, while keeping the total fuel mole fraction constant. It was
found that even replacing small amounts of H2 with CO led to longer
ignition times and a decrease in reactivity. Moreover, the inhibiting
effect of CO addition was found to be much more pronounced with
increasing pressure. Chemical kinetic modeling showed that, at the
intermediate-temperatures and high-pressures explored in this

ric and fuel-lean (’ D 0.5) mixtures of H2, H2/CO, CH4, CH4/CO, CH4/
H2 and CH4/CO/H2. There was no inhibiting effect for replacement of
up to 50% of the H2 with CO, somewhat contrary to the findings of
Mittal et al. [340,341], but in agreement with detailed chemical
kinetic simulations.

mixture reactivity was controlled by hydrogen chemistry, with little
or no inhibiting effect of CO addition to H2, consistent with the work
of Gersen et al. [338]. However, for CO concentrations higher than
50%, the inhibiting effect of CO addition was found to be noticeable.

PWalton et al. [272] studied simulated syngas mixtures for lean to
stoichiometric equivalence ratios, initial oxygen mole percentages
from 15% to 20%, and H2:CO molar ratios between 0.25 and 4.0. They
found that the model of Davis et al. [345] agreed well with the
experimental data, though the trends with temperature and ’ were
not completely in agreement. The chemical kinetic simulations uti-
lized an effective state definition, as discussed in Section 4, to
account for early exothermicity (i.e., pre-ignition heat release)
observed at some test conditions.

PDas et al. [344] studied the effect of water addition on the reactiv-
ity of stoichiometric H2/O2/N2/Ar mixtures, for water addition of 0%,
10%, and 40% by mole. Under high-pressure conditions of 30 and
70 bar, the addition of water was seen to promote ignition. However,
for relatively lower pressure conditions, the addition of water
reduced the reactivity of the mixture. The mechanism of Hong et al.
_
[346] was modified by changing the rate of the reaction
H + O2 D
_
€

OH within the established uncertainty limits. Changing this rate
substantially improved the agreement of the model with both the
dry ignition data (i.e., no water) and the moist ignition data (i.e.,
with water) at low pressures, while not changing the already good
agreement at high pressures.

PDonohoe et al. [347] studied the influence of steam (i.e., water)
dilution on the autoignition behavior of hydrogen, carbon monox-
ide, and syngas mixtures, with 0%, 10%, and 30% H2O dilution. For
the hydrogen and syngas mixtures there was no significant chemi-
cal effect on ignition delay time. However, the higher heat capacity
and lower thermal diffusivity of H2O lead to lower heat losses to
the walls and result in shorter observed ignition delay times. For
the pure CO mixtures a significant chemical effect was observed.
Using a chemical kinetic model to interpret the data it was found
that the increased reactivity was due to the following series of reac-

highlighted earlier, is a critically important high-temperature chain
branching reaction.

PMansfield and Wooldridge [337] investigated the effects of chem-
ical impurities on the combustion of syngas, focusing on CH4, a com-
mon component of syngas, and trimethylsilanol (TMS), an unstudied
impurity related to those commonly found in landfill-based syngas.
Pressure-time history measurements and high-speed imaging of the
ignition process were again used to determine autoignition delay
times and observe ignition behaviors. The four simulated syngas
mixtures used were (1) pure syngas: 30% H2, 70% CO fuel volume,
(2) syngas with CH4: 27% H2, 67% CO, 6% CH4, (3) and (4) pure syngas
with 10 or 100 ppm TMS. The results uniquely illustrated the occur-
rence of two-step ignition behavior at higher pressures, with two
distinct regions of heat release and pressure rise. The first and
second autoignition delay times were therefore defined and inter-
estingly the times were affected differently by the addition of
impurities. The addition of CH4 consistently increased autoignition
delay times up to 40% at 15 bar, while increasing autoignition delay
times at 5 bar by up to a factor of three. Conversely, the addition of
10 ppm TMS caused a consistent decrease of »10(cid:1)30% in autoigni-
tion delay times at 15 bar with insignificant impact at 5 bar, and
100 ppm TMS impurity caused consistent decreases of 50(cid:1)70% at
15 bar and 20(cid:1)30% decreases at 5 bar The marked pressure depen-
dence of the autoignition delay time, typical for syngas at these
conditions, was virtually eliminated for the 100 ppm TMS mixture.
Kinetic modeling suggested that the promoting effects of TMS were
related to enhanced consumption and/or reduced production of
_
H
O2 radicals. The impact of TMS is remarkably similar to that for
SiH4 in pure H2 [348,349], suggesting a possible trend for poorly
understood Si-based species to promote autoignition in syngas and
hydrogen mixtures.

6.2. Linear and branched chain alkanes

PLinear and branched chain alkanes, or paraffins, constitute a
major portion of most modern fuels, including natural gas and
petroleum-based fuels, and there is a long history of their study
using RCMs. They are considered here from the simplest to the
more complex.

P6.2.1. Methane

PMethane is the primary constituent of natural gas and its ignition
chemistry is important for a range of conventional and advanced
combustion strategies. Yet there have been few studies on the oxida-
tion of pure methane in RCMs, most involving mixtures of methane
blended with other fuels such as hydrogen and small alkanes. Meth-
ane is a very unreactive fuel, in part due to the high activation
energy required for abstraction of its H-atoms and also because of
the relative low reactivity of the methyl radicals formed which can,
for example, undergo self-recombination producing stable ethane
molecules. Hence it is difficult to study methane autoignition at the
lower temperature (600(cid:1)1000 K) conditions typically encountered
in RCMs, and high pressures must be utilized and a narrow range of
temperatures covered. A summary of studies using methane and
methane-blended fuels is provided in Table 3.

PBrett et al. [115] reported ignition delay times for CH4/O2/Ar mix-
tures over a narrow temperature range. The experimental measure-
ments of ignition delay time were significantly longer than those
predicted by two chemical kinetic mechanisms, especially at tem-
peratures below 1000 K. Gersen et al. [338] also studied a stoichio-
metric CH4/O2/N2/Ar mixture and compared their data with the
same models as Brett et al. [115]. While Gersen et al. [338] found
that neither model agreed well with their data as well, the data from
the study of Gersen et al. [338] agreed well with the model from the
work of Petersen et al. [360].

PFurutani et al. [350] also reported ignition delay times for CH4/
O2/Ar mixtures over a narrow temperature range. They compared
the measurements to ignition delay times for blends of CH4/C2H6,

PCH4/C3H8, and CH4/n-C4H10, albeit at slightly lower temperatures, e.
g., 900(cid:1)1100 K; however, they did not evaluate predictions from
any kinetic model. It was found that at 20:1 molar blend ratios, the
stimulating influence of ethane and propane were very similar, with
reductions in tign of 60%, while n-butane was much more effective,
reducing tign by 80%. Furthermore, their measurements demon-
strated a non-linear response to n-butane doping for molar blend
ratios of CH4:n-C4H10 D 1, 3.25, 20,and 100.

PBurke et al. [351] studied the ignition of methane as part of a
larger study involving methane/DME mixtures using three different
shock tubes and an RCM. Under conditions listed in Table 3, they
found that the ignition delays agreed well with a new mechanism
they developed in their work.

PYu et al. [352] also studied the ignition of methane as part of a
larger study involving natural gas (i.e. blends of methane, ethane,
and propane). They found that the ignition delays decreased mono-
tonically with increasing temperature, but that tign at the lowest
temperatures was very sensitive to random uncertainties in the
experimental conditions. Near 880 K, for instance, variations of up to
§50% in ignition delay times were seen.

P6.2.2. Methane/hydrogen mixtures

PMethane/hydrogen fuel blends have recently drawn attention
due to interest in increasing the use of carbon-less and low-carbon

Pfuels. There are potential greenhouse gas benefits as well as substan-
tial emissions reductions that could be realized with engines operat-
ing on such fuel blends. Furthermore, hydrogen can enhance the
reactivity of methane at engine-relevant conditions so that these
fuel blends are easier to utilize than pure methane, resulting in
lower inlet temperatures and/or reduced compression ratios neces-
sary for effective engine operation.

blends were considered, ranging from pure methane to pure hydro-
gen. They found significant non-linear behavior where, for hydrogen
addition to methane at hydrogen mole percentages below 20% there
was only a slight decrease in reactivity but at mole percentages
above 50% there was a substantial decrease in ignition delay times.
Results for fuel-lean mixtures showed a slight effect of ’ on reactiv-
ity. All experiments were simulated using the detailed chemical
kinetic model of Petersen et al. [360], where generally good agree-
ment was observed between the simulations and the experimental

Pdilution. Pure methane and hydrogen-blended mixtures were pre-
pared, and it was found that increasing the hydrogen concentration
increased reactivity, reducing ignition delay times, consistent with
the findings of Gersen et al. [336] and Yu et al. [352].

P6.2.3. Methane/natural gas mixtures

PWhile the primary component of natural gas is methane, small
alkanes from C2 to C5 can constitute a significant fraction of the fuel,
from 15 to 35%, especially when extracted from gas fields that are
enhanced via unconventional extraction techniques like hydraulic
fracturing. Often, such gas supplies are termed ‘wet’ natural gas,
particularly if the heavier hydrocarbon fraction is large.

PHeyne et al. [354] studied the oxidation of a CH4/C2H6/C3H8 blend
containing 89/9/2 molar percentages. The measured ignition delay
times were compared to predictions using six chemical kinetic
mechanisms and most of the models were found to over-predict the
experimental ignition delays. To generate an improved model, com-
ponents of Gas Research Institute reaction mechanism, GRI-Mech
3.0 [361] were combined with the RAM Accelerator Mechanism
(RAMEC) [287], and two additional ethane reactions, and the rate
constants for 25 of the most sensitive reactions were adjusted within
their established uncertainty bounds by an evolutionary algorithm.
It was found that at the experimental conditions, reactions involving
peroxy and methylperoxy radicals were most sensitive and required
the largest changes in rate constants to adequately match the exper-
imental results.

PHealy et al. [355,356] used both a high-pressure shock tube and
an RCM to study a series of natural gas mixtures covering a wide
composition envelope, and at high-pressure conditions (up to
50 bar) of interest to the gas turbine industry. These were the first
such studies to present ignition delay times at conditions that signif-
icantly overlapped shock tube and RCM facilities, and demonstrated
the influences of facility effects such as heat loss, on the measure-
ments in the two different devices.

PMethane/propane mixtures in synthetic air were studied by
Healy et al. [355] for blends containing molar ratios of CH4/C3H8
of 90/10 and 70/30. The data showed characteristic NTC behavior
which was more pronounced for mixtures containing higher frac-
tions of propane. The findings highlighted the increasing roles
of the formation of ROOH and cyclic ethers on the oxidation
processes. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was used to
simulate the experimental data, and the model was able to quali-
tatively reproduce the influence of temperature, pressure, and
equivalence ratio very well. Reasonable quantitative agreement
was observed for some mixtures; for the 90/10 blends good
agreement was observed over the entire range of conditions. For
the 70/30 blends the model tended to over-predict reactivity,
with the divergence between the model and the experimental
data being more pronounced at lower temperatures, higher pres-
sures and for fuel-rich mixtures, highlighting the complexities of
fuel blend interactions.

PHealy et al. [355] also studied the oxidation of CH4/C2H6/C3H8/air
mixtures for blends containing molar ratios of 90/6.6/3.3, 70/15/15,
and 70/20/10 of each respective fuel component. The data were sim-
ulated using a detailed chemical kinetic model which qualitatively
reproduced the effect of change in equivalence ratio and pressure,
predicting that fuel-rich, high-pressure mixtures ignited fastest
while fuel-lean, low-pressure mixtures ignited slowest. Moreover,
the evolution of the reactivity as a function of temperature was well
captured, with the model predicting NTC behavior similar to experi-
mental observations. Quantitatively the model was generally in
excellent agreement with the experimental results but produced
shorter reaction times than measurements for the fuel-rich mixture
containing the highest quantity of propane (70/15/15 mixture) at
the lowest temperatures (770(cid:1)900 K), similar to the study for the
methane/propane mixtures [355].

PHealy et al. [356] studied the autoignition of CH4/n-C4H10 mix-
tures containing molar ratios of 90/10 and 70/30. A detailed chemi-
cal kinetic model developed in [355] was shown to quantitatively
reproduce the ignition delays, accurately capturing fuel mixture
reactivity as a function of fuel composition, equivalence ratio,
temperature, and pressure.

PIgnition delay times for the oxidation of quinternary (CH4/C2H6/
C3H8/n-C4H10/n-C5H12) natural gas mixtures [278,357,358] were
measured. In an attempt to test a wide range of natural gas composi-
tion, two natural gas mixtures were studied, one containing 81.25%
methane with decreasing concentrations (10/5/2.5/1.25%) of pro-
gressively larger alkanes (C2H6/C3H8/n-C4H10/n-C5H12) referred to as
NG2, and another composed of approximately 62.5% methane and
relatively higher concentrations (20/10/5/2.5%) of larger hydrocar-
bon species, referred to as NG3. A detailed chemical kinetic model
was used to simulate the data with good agreement observed
between the model and the experimentally measured delay times.
The NG3 mixtures produced faster reaction times compared to the
NG2 ones, as the former contained higher concentrations of larger
alkanes which have greater reactivity along the LTC pathways
described in Fig. 37.

PYu et al. [352] studied the effect of several EGR and syngas com-
ponents on the autoignition of a natural gas mixture composed of
89% methane, 9% ethane and 2% propane. Ignition delay times for
methane, natural gas, and mixtures of natural gas with hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water were measured. The
results showed that H2 addition accelerated mixture reactivity, simi-
lar to the findings of Gersen et al. [336]. The experimental data
were simulated using four chemical kinetic mechanisms from the
literature; the model by Heyne et al. [354], the NUIG model
[278,357,358], the model by Wang et al. [362], and the GRI-Mech 3.0
model [361] with the RAMEC sub-mechanism [287]. It was found
that natural gas ignition delays could be reproduced satisfactorily,
but improvements in the mechanisms were needed in order to
achieve an accurate, quantitative account of the effect of the inclu-
sion of hydrogen.

PAs discussed earlier for methane/hydrogen mixtures, Donohoe
et al. [353] also measured ignition delay times for natural gas/hydro-
gen mixtures. Two synthetic natural gas-fueled mixtures were used
which contained methane, ethane, propane, n-butane and n-pen-
tane, with one comprising 81.25/10/5/2.5/1.25% while the other con-
sisted of 62.5/20/10/5/2.5% C1/C2/C3/C4/C5 components in order to
encompass a wide range of possible natural gas compositions. The
experimental data showed that tign decreased with increasing tem-
perature, pressure, and an increase in long-chain hydrocarbons, sim-
ilar to earlier findings of [278,357,358]. Moreover, increasing the
H2 concentration also increased reactivity, reducing tign, consistent
again with the findings of Gersen et al. [336] and Yu et al. [352]. All
experiments were simulated using a detailed chemical kinetic model
[363] and generally, good agreement was observed between the
model and the experiments.

PAs discussed above for hydrogen/syngas mixtures in the same
study, Donohoe et al. [347] also reported the influence of steam (i.e.,
water) dilution on the autoignition behavior of methane and natural
gas mixtures with 0%, 10%, and 30% steam dilution. For all fuel mix-
tures it was found that there was no significant chemical effect on
tign, but that significant changes in the thermal properties affected
reactivity. Again, the primary effect was via the thermal and trans-
port properties: the addition of water increases the heat capacity
and reduces the thermal diffusivity of the mixtures, leading to lower
heat losses and shorter observed tign.

PThe findings of many of these recent investigations on natural gas
highlight needs to further improve the understanding of the chemi-
cal kinetics of higher hydrocarbons and hydrogen, especially at
high-pressure and low-temperature, at fuel-rich conditions and the
influence of EGR components, and in conjunction, formulate models

Pwhich can quantitatively capture the experimental trends observed
for future LTC engines.

P6.2.4. Ethane

PGersen et al. [359] studied the ignition of methane, ethane and
methane/ethane mixtures subject to NO2 doping. As expected from
previous work involving carbon chains longer than methane, ethane
is more reactive than methane. Furthermore, the data revealed that
NO2 addition to methane and methane/ethane blends significantly
increases the fuel reactivity, and this stimulating effect increases
at higher temperatures. Doping of NO2 to ethane however, was
not nearly as effective. Their modeling results suggested that the
ignition-promoting effects are due to new conversion channels

P6.2.5. Propane

PPropane is a significant component of ‘wet’ natural gas, as well as
petroleum. These feed-stocks are often refined to produce fuels such
as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), where LPG can be used in vehicles
as well as various heating appliances. LPG consists primarily of pro-
pane/butane blends, though significant quantities of propene and
isobutene can also be present. In addition to its importance as a fuel
component, propane is the smallest alkane for which cool flame and
NTC behavior can be observed at engine-relevant conditions, as evi-
dent in some of the natural gas studies previously described, and
discussed recently by Merchant et al. [61]. A summary of the low
temperature autoignition work carried out on propane, butane
isomers, and pentane isomers mixtures is provided in Table 4.

PGallagher et al. [277] investigated the oxidation of propane for
the conditions listed in Table 4. These data exhibited the characteris-
tic NTC behavior generated by the competing reaction pathways dis-
cussed in connection with Fig. 37. Gallagher et al. [277] found good
agreement with a model they developed, both with their RCM data
and previously published flow reactor data. Interestingly, it was
found that the ignition delay times recorded in the RCM were almost
two orders of magnitude longer than those reported by Cadman

Pet al. [375] and Herzler et al. [376,377] in shock tubes at tempera-
tures below approximately 1000 K. These discrepancies have been
discussed by Davidson and Hanson [47], Pang et al. [378], Petersen
et al. [379], and Chaos and Dryer [305] from the perspective of shock
tube experiments. Those studies highlighted the fact that non-ideal
effects in shock tubes, including incident shock wave attenuation
due to boundary layer growth, as well as other physical interactions
may lead to pressure increases during the induction period, resulting
in shorter ignition delays than if at a constant internal energy/spe-
cific volume condition. Moreover, in the experiments performed by
Herzler et al. [376,377] this type of pressure rise was identified and
highlighted by Petersen et al. [379], though the cause of it could not
be exactly determined. As discussed in Sections 2 and 4, RCMs gener-
ally experience a pressure decrease during the induction period due
to heat loss, and this extends ignition delay times relative to a con-
stant internal energy/specific volume condition. The different char-
acteristic effects of heat loss in RCMs and in shock tubes can explain
some discrepancies in literature data, though further experimental
datasets may help to clarify these issues further. Significantly, the
discrepancies highlight the need for careful selection of the simula-
tion framework, at the minimum including heat loss and boundary
layer effects, as described in Section 5, when comparing simulation
results to many experimental datasets.

PRecently, Dames et al. [364] developed a binary fuel model for
propane and DME under engine-relevant conditions where they
studied pure propane over a range of conditions. Both t1 and tign
were measured experimentally for these mixtures and a detailed
chemical kinetic model compared favorably to the data. It was
_
found that the reactions of H-atom abstraction from the fuel by
OH
_
radicals (R1) and also the reactions n-C3H7O
O2 (R3c)
_
and
OH (R6a, R7) all
controlled the low-temperature autoignition of propane. Rate con-
stants for these reactions were taken from the work of Goldsmith
et al. [380] and Merchant et al. [61] with some small adjustments in
activation energies for the key reactions.

Pis used as a blending agent for gasoline in cold weather environ-
ments due to its relatively high vapor pressure. This improves a
gasoline's vaporization characteristics within an engine's intake
manifold or combustion chamber and thereby enhances combustion
stability while reducing emissions. From a fundamental perspective,
butane is the smallest alkane that has isomeric structure branching.
PCarlier et al. [365] reported total ignition delay times for an
n-C4H10/O2/N2/Ar mixture, with the proportions of O2 and N2 + Ar
similar to that found in air. Ignition delay times ranged from about
90 to 180 ms, which is close to the ‘loss of adiabaticity’ limit shown
in Fig. 28. Simulations were performed using a chemical kinetic
mechanism by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
[381], and it was found that the model was substantially more reac-
tive than the experiments, in that the NTC region started at a lower
temperature (670 K in the model compared to 700 K in the experi-
ments) and ended earlier (710 K in the model, 810 K in the experi-
ments). However, the magnitude of the ignition delays at the start
and end of the NTC region was similar between the experiments and
the model.

PGriffiths et al. [76] studied the autoignition characteristics of
n-butane and isobutane as part of a study including hydrocarbons
between C4 and C7. It was found that n-butane was much slower to
react compared to the larger n-alkanes and this corresponded
with its higher octane rating. They postulated that, because low-
_
temperature chemistry is driven by alkylperoxyl (RO
O) radical
isomerization (R3a) followed by decomposition reactions to oxygen-
_
OH radicals (R5c), the reduced reactivity of
ated products and
n-butane might be associated with the inability to readily form
_
hydroperoxy-peroxy species, e.g.,
OOQOOH via (R5a). It was also
considered likely that the reactivities of the more highly branched
species, including isobutane, were constrained by similar mecha-
nisms to those controlling n-butane. There was no indication how-
ever, in either the pressure or light emission records, of a vigorous
development of two-stage ignition during the oxidation of isobu-
tane. Its reduced reactivity was thus ascribed to the activation ener-
gies associated with the transition states created during intra-
molecular H-atom isomerization reactions as a result of the tighter
carbon-atom structure, and the opportunity of only a primary
H-atom internal transfer when the initial radical is formed at the
tertiary site. This work provided significant contributions of early
experimental insights for the effects of branched structures on auto-
ignition behavior in LTC regimes.

PMinetti et al. [221] measured t1 and tign for the oxidation
and autoignition of stoichiometric, fuel-lean (’ D 0.8) and fuel-rich
(’ D 1.2) n-butane/air mixtures. In addition, concentration measure-
ments for selected major and minor species were recorded using a
rapid sampling system and GC(cid:1)MS analysis, as discussed in Section
3. C4 heterocycles were identified, which were believed to be formed
_
via isomerization and decomposition of butylperoxyl radicals (RO
O)
via (R5c). These data were simulated using a detailed chemical
kinetic mechanism [382] and predicted ignition delay times were
found to be of the same order of magnitude as those measured
experimentally. Reasonably good agreement was found for the
major species profiles, but minor species including 1- and 2-butene,
tetrahydrofuran, methyloxetane, and 2,3-dimethyl oxirane were
poorly predicted. This work highlighted the utility of employing
intermediate species as additional validation targets for chemical
kinetic mechanisms, while it has been recently demonstrated that
ignition delay times may not sufficiently constrain a model so that
measured time-histories of important intermediate species can pro-
vide additional constraints [383].

PMinetti et al. [79] compared tign measured for linear and branch
chained alkanes including n-butane, n-pentane, neopentane, n-hep-
tane, and isooctane. The data for n-butane reported in the work of
Minetti et al. [221] were compared to data recorded for n-pentane
and n-heptane for stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures. It was shown

Pthat n-butane was considerably slower to react compared to the
larger alkanes, consistent with the findings of Griffiths et al. [76].
Moreover, the minimum ignition temperature was higher for
n-butane at approximately 700 K, compared to close to 670 K for
n-pentane, and 625 K for n-heptane. Three chemical kinetic mecha-
nisms were used to simulate the n-butane results, one taken from
Kojima [384], one from Ranzi et al. [385], and the last developed by
the authors [79] in their study. It was found that the mechanism
from Ranzi et al. [385] best matched the n-butane experimental
data.

PKim et al. [138] studied the effects of pressure and temperature
on the autoignition of stoichiometric n-butane/synthetic air, as well
as mixtures of propane/n-butane containing 20/80 and 40/60 molar
volume blends of the two fuels. Compressed gas temperatures were
attained by altering the ratio of the inert gas components (Ar and
N2). Two-stage ignition events and NTC behavior were experimen-
tally observed. As the propane concentration was increased, the mix-
ture reactivity decreased; at 750 K, for the blends with 20% and 40%
propane, tign increased by approximately 41% and 55% respectively,
relative to tign measured for pure n-butane. These data highlighted
_
the difficulty of achieving RO
O isomerization with propane com-
pared to n-butane (R3a).

the authors observed temperature-dependent

PGersen et al. [366] measured ignition delay times of n-butane
and isobutane. Both butane isomers exhibited two-stage ignition at
low temperatures (680(cid:1)825 K), and also NTC behavior. Interest-
ingly, at temperatures below about 900 K, ignition delay times for
n-butane were shorter than for isobutane, while above this temper-
ature both isomers showed almost identical ignition delays. This
feature highlights the influence that branched structures have on
_
O isomerization and decomposition reactions to form oxy-
the RO
_
genated products and
OH radicals at lower temperatures. In addi-

reactivity in terms of ’. Below approximately 720 K, the ignition
delays were relatively insensitive to ’. However, above that tem-
perature, there was a marked difference in reactivity, resulting in a
factor of 2 difference in ignition delay at ’ D 0.5 versus ’ D 1.0. The
amplitude of the NTC region was decreased by increasing pressure
from 15 to 30 bar, while this pressure increase reduced the ignition
delay time for both isomers by roughly a factor of 3. In the region
where two-stage ignition was observed, the duration of the first
ignition stage decreased sharply in the temperature range of
680(cid:1)770 K, but became essentially constant above 770 K. These
data were simulated using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism
[358] and good quantitative agreement was observed between the
measurements and calculations for n-butane including both igni-
tion delay times in the two-stage region. However, substantial dif-
ferences were observed for isobutane, particularly in the NTC
region, indicating that more work was needed to better understand
and predict the influence of isobutane's methyl branch on its LTC
behavior.

PHealy et al. [285] used both an RCM and a shock tube to mea-
sure ignition delay times for n-butane/air mixtures for lean to rich
equivalence ratios covering a wide range of temperatures and pres-
sure. A detailed chemical kinetic model was used to simulate the
data and this was also able to reproduce a range of previously pub-
lished ignition delay time data for n-butane, showing generally
good agreement.

PHealy et al [367]. followed this with autoignition experiments
using isobutane/air mixtures across similar temperature and pres-
sure conditions, conducted within an RCM and a shock tube. The
detailed kinetic model for n-butane developed previously [285] was
updated with new reactions for isobutane combustion. The model
again showed good agreement with the data from this study, as well
as data available in the literature. The authors further used this
model to compare the reactivities of the butane isomers, and their
simulations correlated. They found that n-butane was more reactive

higher equivalence ratios and lower pressures.

P6.2.7. Pentane isomers

PPentane is an intermediate/heavy component of ‘wet’ natural gas
and is also present as a lighter component within petroleum feed-
stocks. It is often used as a primary constituent to denature ethanol
that is produced for E85 flexible fuel. Since its octane rating is lower
than that of gasoline, it can be blended with high fractions of etha-
nol, which has a research octane number (RON) of 109, and thus
achieve an octane rating that is suitable for modern gasoline engines.
The three isomers of pentane have provided substantial insight into
the influence of molecular structure on autoignition at LTC condi-
tions.

PIn the study on the autoignition characteristics of C4(cid:1)C7 n-alka-
nes published by Griffiths et al. [76], n-pentane was studied using
stoichiometric mixtures in synthetic air. In this study greater reac-
tivity was reported as the carbon number of the n-alkanes was
increased. This was evident in both the measured minimum temper-
ature at which spontaneous ignition first occurred, and in the mini-
mum and maximum duration of the ignition delay times measured
in the NTC region (»720(cid:1)850 K for n-pentane and n-hexane). These
trends corresponded loosely with the octane ratings of these fuels
[386]. Moreover, the reactivity of n-pentane and n-hexane paralleled
one another throughout the entire temperature range, with n-pen-
tane being consistently a factor of two or so slower compared to n-
hexane.

PIn another study, Griffiths et al. [368] measured ignition delay
times for a range of alkanes (C4(cid:1)C8) and mixtures of the PRFs, n-hep-
tane and isooctane, using stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures. Ignition
delay times were reported as a function of temperature for n-pen-
tane and 2,2-dimethylpropane (neopentane), among other fuels
including PRF mixtures. The ignition delay times for neopentane and
n-pentane were compared to fuels of similar RON covering a range
of temperatures and pressures. The reactivity of PRF80 was com-
pared to 2,4-dimethylpentane (RON D 83), 3,3-dimethylpentane
(RON D 81), and neopentane (RON D 85). It was shown that all four
fuels exhibited very different reactivities, with neopentane, which
had the highest RON being the fastest to ignite across all tempera-
tures. The same was true when n-pentane (RON D 62.5) was com-
pared with PRF60, where n-pentane was shown to ignite faster than
PRF60 in the temperature range of 700(cid:1)900 K, even though it has a
higher RON. However, at temperatures below 700 K and above
900 K, n-pentane was slower to ignite compared to PRF60. These
findings, along with those presented in [76] provided early demon-
strations of the complexity of autoignition processes within the NTC
regime, and this leads to particular challenges associated with using
octane ratings as a metric to characterize and predict fuel perfor-
mance within advanced LTC regimes which are governed, or signifi-
cantly influenced by autoignition chemistry. Furthermore,
the
findings highlight challenges of relating results from fundamental
apparatuses like RCMs and flow reactors to fuel performance in com-
bustion engines.

PMinetti et al. [79] acquired ignition delay data for linear and
branch chain alkanes including n-pentane and neopentane, among
other fuels discussed in other sections of this review. Fuel-oxygen-
inert mixtures were prepared with inert gases N2, Ar, and CO2 used
in varying proportions to achieve different compressed gas tempera-
tures. Stoichiometric mixtures were studied for all fuels where the
compressed pressure was adjusted depending on the fuel reactivity
and the mixture equivalence ratio. n-Pentane and neopentane were
studied at intermediate pressures, representing the intermediate
reactivity of the fuels investigated. Both two-stage and single-stage
ignition were identified in the pressure and natural light output
traces. It was demonstrated that for stoichiometric n-pentane/air
mixtures, tign decreased with increasing compressed charge density

Pi.e., pressure. Moreover, at a mean compressed charge density of
89.3 mol/m3 it was shown that neo-pentane was slower to react
compared to n-pentane in the temperature range of 650(cid:1)950 K. Fur-
thermore, the minimum ignition temperature of 700 K was higher
for neopentane than the 675 K required for n-pentane.

PWestbrook et al. [369] used RCM measurements to examine the
influences of pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio on the
autoignition of n-pentane. The experiments were simulated using a
detailed chemical kinetic mechanism where the calculations showed
that for most experiments, the fuel exhibited two-stage autoignition
except at the highest temperatures where little or no first-stage
autoignition occurred. The model predicted that the first-stage igni-
_
O radical isomerization
tion was controlled by low-temperature RO
pathways (R3a) that are quenched very effectively when the temper-
_
ature reaches a level such that the dissociation of RO
O (R3b, R3c) and
_
peroxyl-alkylhydroperoxide (
OOQOOH) radicals (R5b, R5c), respec-
tively, become more rapid than the reverse addition steps. The sec-
ignition was predicted to be controlled by the
ond stage of
_
dissociation of H2O2, leading to the formation of two reactive
OH
radicals. One important point of their work was that, in some cases,
LTHR was predicted to occur during the compression stroke. This
feature, as discussed in Section 4, can complicate the interpretation
of experimental datasets since the ‘compression’ limit is reached
and it is difficult to ascertain a baseline for defining the ignition
delay time. Modifications to the test gas conditions, e.g., pc, or the
machine configuration, e.g., t50, can be used to overcome this, while
simulations that include the full compression stroke are necessary
to compare with experimental measurements.

PCox et al. [77] studied the autoignition of n-pentane in stoichio-
metric mixtures with air. In the lower temperature range, two-stage
ignition occurred and the first-stage of ignition consumed approxi-
mately 15% of the fuel, based on physical gas sampling and subse-
quent GC analysis. However, at the higher temperature range, the
fuel ignited in one stage with a smoothly increasing extent of fuel
consumption. In both cases, there was no measurable fuel decompo-
sition during the compression stroke.

PRibaucour et al. [370] and Minetti and Ribaucour [81] compared
the autoignition behavior of n-pentane and 1-pentene. They found
both fuels showed two-stage ignition and NTC behavior, with 1-pen-
tene being less reactive. Its minimum ignition temperature limit was
higher than n-pentene, 700 K compared to 650 K, at a compressed
pressure of 7.4 bar, while early exothermicity and NTC behavior
were stronger for n-pentane and were observed over a wider tem-
perature range. These features illustrate differences in the isomeri-
zation and formation of diperoxy species which are necessary for
low-temperature oxidation, as discussed previously. Using their gas
sampling apparatus and GC(cid:1)MS analysis, these researchers com-
pared typical common products formed at low temperatures, includ-
ing the extent of fuel consumption as well as concentrations of
C4(cid:1)C5 olefins, C5 cyclic ethers, and C2(cid:1)C4 aldehydes. Very different
distribution patterns were observed. n-Pentane produced high con-
centrations of 2-pentene, 1-pentene, and 1-butene, and low concen-
the di-olefins 1,3-butadiene, and 1,3-pentadiene.
trations of
Conversely, 1-pentene produced relatively high concentrations of
1,3-butadiene and 1,3-pentadiene. C5 cyclic ethers (2-ethyl-3-meth-
yloxirane, 2-ethyloxetane, 2,4-dimethyloxetane, and 2-methyltetra-
hydrofuran) were produced in significant concentrations during the
oxidation of n-pentane, with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran dominating,
whereas only propyloxirane was produced in any significant quan-
tity for 1-pentene. Interestingly, its concentration was almost an
order of magnitude higher for 1-pentene compared to n-pentane
oxidation. Ethanal was the predominant aldehyde formed for both
fuels, but significant concentrations of propenal and butanal were
produced during the oxidation of 1-pentene, whereas propanal was
more substantial for n-pentane with little butanal formed. A detailed
mechanism was developed to simulate ignition delay times, LTHR

Pand product species distributions. Good results were obtained for
_
1-pentene, but only when: (1) direct addition channels of
OH and
_
O2 radicals to the double bond were included, and (2) if a higher
H
rate constant
the hydroperoxyalkyl
_
QOOH) radicals into cyclic ethers (R5c) was used when this radical
(
_
was formed by direct H
O2 radical addition instead of isomerization
_
of RO
O radicals. Analysis of the chemical kinetic mechanism for
1-pentene indicated that the total ignition delay time depended on
_
the competition between
QOOH radical addition to molecular oxy-
gen (R5a) followed by reactions leading to chain branching, and
the propagation reactions generating smaller alkenes (R5b). t1 was
found to depend mainly on the rate of decomposition of unsaturated
ketohydroperoxides (R8). This work contributed key, detailed exper-
imental and modeling results which identified influences of double
carbon bonds on the chemical kinetic processes leading to cool flame
and NTC behavior at LTC conditions.

PRibaucour et al. [371] measured ignition delay times for the three
isomers of pentane in order to better understand the influences of
variations in fuel molecular structure on autoignition behavior. It
was found that under similar conditions, the fuels showed reactivity
in the order n-pentane > neopentane > isopentane, while isopen-
tane showed a much stronger NTC behavior compared to the other
two isomers. The reactivity trends indicated greater flux through
(R3c) from the alkyl radical combination with O2 for isopentane, rel-
_
ative to the formation of the RO
O radical (R3a). Simulations were
also conducted using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism where
the model indicated that, in most cases, the reactive gases experi-
enced two-stage heat release, except at the highest compressed tem-
peratures, where little or no first-stage ignition was observed.
Similar to the work of Westbrook et al. [369], it was indicated that
the first-stage ignition is effectively quenched when the decomposi-
_
OOQOOH radicals becomes faster than the reverse
tion of RO
addition steps. The second-stage ignition was found to be controlled
by the dissociation of H2O2.

_
O and

PRecently, Bugler et al. [372] used RCM data to re-investigate the
kinetics of low-temperature fuel oxidation by studying the three iso-
mers of pentane. By updating the thermochemical parameters asso-
_
ciated with the intermediate species, e.g. RO
QOOH radicals,
and using rate constants calculated from the literature, including
Villano et al. [387,388], Miyoshi [389,390], Goldsmith et al. [380],
and Sharma et al. [391], it was possible to capture the reactivity of
all three isomers using a detailed chemical kinetic model. This work
highlighted the importance of consistently representing thermo-
chemical properties towards achieving predictive capability of
kinetic models at RCM (i.e., engine-relevant) conditions.

_
O and

PBugler et al. [373] went on to investigate all three pentane iso-
mers in both an RCM and two shock tubes. The data were recorded
over a wide range of stoichiometry and compressed conditions.
Comparisons of the reactivity of the three isomers at the higher pres-
sures indicated that at low temperatures (640(cid:1)900 K), the fuels
showed reactivity in the order n-pentane > neopentane > isopen-
tane, as observed in the study of Ribaucour et al. [371]. However, the
reactivity of all three isomers tended to converge at 900 K. At higher
temperatures (900(cid:1)1450 K) the reactivities of n-pentane and iso-
pentane were very similar, both being greater than the reactivity of
neopentane. This was investigated using a chemical kinetic model
where it was found at low temperatures neopentane reacts faster
than isopentane because there is no possible concerted elimination
reaction of neopentyl-peroxyl radicals whereas these are possible
for isopentyl-peroxyl radicals (and also for n-pentyl-peroxyl radi-
cals). At temperatures in the range 900(cid:1)1100 K, fuel alkyl radicals
_
still add to molecular oxygen forming RO
O radicals (R2a) and the
concerted elimination reactions possible for n- and isopentane lead
_
to the formation of olefins and H
O2 radicals via (R3c). The lack of a
concerted elimination reaction for neopentane leads to its much
reduced reactivity at these temperature (900(cid:1)1100 K) and pressure

_
P((cid:2) 10 bar) conditions, since the conversion of H
O2 radicals to H2O2,
_
and subsequently two
OH radicals is prevented. neoPentane contin-
ues to show a much reduced reactivity in comparison to the other
two isomers at even higher temperatures because b-scission of the
neopentyl radical leads to the formation of isobutene and a methyl
radical. isoButene, or methylpropene is a particularly unreactive
intermediate, as H-atom abstraction from it leads to the generation
of relatively unreactive, resonantly stabilized methyl allyl radicals.
The unmodified chemical kinetic model developed by Bugler et al.
[373] was also used to successfully simulate species profiles mea-
sured as a function of temperature at 1 and 10 bar in two different
jet-stirred reactors [392].

P6.2.8. Hexane isomers

PHexane is a major component of petroleum-derived gasoline, and
its five linear and branched chain isomeric structures result in a wide
range of autoignition behavior.

PAffleck and Fish [70] studied the autoignition of 2-methylpentane
under engine-relevant, fuel-lean conditions in an RCM, and sub-
atmospheric pressure, fuel-rich conditions in a Pyrex reactor. The
work focused on comparing the products of first-stage ignition
between the different conditions. In general, the measured products
between the cases were very similar, indicating a common chemical
mechanism could be operating at the widely varying pressure and
equivalence ratio conditions.

PFish and co-workers [72,73,393] studied autoignition processes
for four hexane isomers including 2-methylpentane, n-hexane, 2,2-
dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane. The autoignition charac-
teristics were also compared to isooctane and PRF mixtures of 25,
60, and 80 octane ratings. The authors removed gas samples from
the reaction chamber for analysis by gas chromatography. These
were some of the first speciated data to probe the decomposition
and oxidation processes of a gasoline relevant constituent at LTC
conditions. By using measurements of t1 and tign, the authors were
able to determine the relationship of the second-stage ignition delay
(i.e., the difference between t1 and tign) with Dp1. In addition, they
used the sampling experiments to elucidate the mechanism of low-
temperature oxidation of the fuels they studied, establishing further
experimental evidence for the chain carrying and chain branching
species during low-temperature oxidation of alkanes under engine-
relevant conditions.

PGriffiths et al. [368] included 2-methylpentane in their measure-
ments of C4(cid:1)C8 alkanes where stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures
were used. Ignition delay times were reported as a function of tem-
perature comparing the reactivity of 2-methylpentane (RON D 73)
to a PRF70 mixture. 2-Methylpentane was found to ignite more
readily than the PRF70 mixture in the temperature range of
730(cid:1)950 K. At lower temperatures, however, 2-methylpentane was
slower to react and had a higher minimum ignition temperature of
700 K compared to 675 K for the PRF70 mixture. This study further
illustrated differences that exist in LTC autoignition behavior for
fuels having different molecular structure, but very similar octane
ratings.

PZhang et al. [374] measured ignition delay times for n-hexane in
an RCM at stoichiometric conditions. These data were also comple-
mented by data measured in a shock tube for multiple fuel mixtures
and over a range of temperature and pressure. Moreover, to further
study the concentration of intermediate species formed during the
oxidation process, experiments were performed in a jet-stirred reac-
tor over a wide temperature range of 530(cid:1)1160 K at 10 bar and at
equivalence ratios of ’ D 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. A detailed chemical kinetic
model was developed to simulate the experimental results, which
was largely based on the reaction rate rules developed in the studies
of Bugler et al. [372,373] for the pentane isomers. It was found that
the new model was able to simulate the hexane results measured
in the study, while the rules were successfully applied to simulate

conditions of pressure, temperature, and mixture composition

P6.2.9. Heptane isomers

PNormal heptane has been used for many years as a reference fuel
for gasoline and diesel. Its octane rating of 0 is used to establish one
extremum of the octane scale, while its cetane rating is very similar
to the rating of typical petroleum-derived diesel sold in North
America. Moreover, substantial work has been undertaken using
n-heptane as a two-component surrogate, i.e., primary reference
fuel blend for gasoline and a single-component surrogate for diesel
engines. The study of n-heptane in RCMs can be challenging due to
its high reactivity. Most work to date has utilized low pressures,
extensive dilution or very lean conditions in order to overcome this.
A summary of the work carried out on n-heptane and larger alkanes
is provided in Table 5.

_
O and

PGriffiths et al. [76] studied the ignition of several n-alkanes. Under
the conditions investigated, n-heptane showed the highest level of
reactivity and appeared to show the least amount of NTC behavior in
the temperature range of 700(cid:1)850 K, indicating that at these condi-
_
QOOH isomerization processes, (R3a) and (R5a),
tions the RO
respectively, are much quicker than their competing decomposition to
_
H
O2 + alkene/ether/carbonyl species, (R3c) and (R5b), respectively, for
the C7 normal alkane. This behavior was shown by Curran et al. [274]
to be a facility effect caused by heat losses, non-homogeneous effects
or reaction during compression, with the model of Curran at al. repro-
ducing these n-heptane experiments by incorporating heat losses and
reaction during compression.

PCox et al.

[77] studied the autoignition characteristics of
stoichiometric n-heptane/air mixtures. Gas samples were also
extracted from the reactive mixture during the chemical induction
period and fuel conversion profiles were recorded. Under the
higher temperature conditions, a substantial portion of the n-
heptane was consumed during the compression stroke causing a
first-stage of ignition to occur during piston compression,
i.e.,

Pbefore the test conditions were reached. At the lower temperature
conditions however, little to no fuel was consumed during the com-
pression stroke, and two-stage ignition was present at the end-of-
compression condition, consuming about 40% of the fuel in the
first-stage, which was much greater than observed in their analo-
gous tests using n-pentane.

PMinetti et al. [80,222] measured ignition delay times and interme-
diate species concentrations during autoignition of stoichiometric n-
heptane/air mixtures. A wide range of species, including cyclic ethers,
were identified from their mass spectra. Concentration profiles of
alkenes, aldehydes, and ethers were recorded, showing significant
formation during the first-stage of ignition and consumption during
the main ignition event for most of the LTC intermediates. These
studies discussed the primary oxidation pathways of alkylperoxyl
and hydroperoxy-alkyl radicals, including isomerizations of the for-
mer, (R3a), and scissions of the latter, (R5b) and (R5c).

PTanaka et al. [395] measured ignition delay times of n-heptane
for varying ’ D 0.2(cid:1)0.5. In agreement with the study of Fish et al.
[72], tign was shown to correlate well with the energy released dur-
ing the first-stage of ignition, or LTHR, as indicated by the initial
pressure rise, Dp1.

PSilke et al. [396] measured ignition delay times of the nine hep-
tane isomers/air mixtures in order to study the influence of molecu-
lar structure on ignition propensity. The recorded ignition delays
showed good agreement with those reported by Griffiths et al. [76]
at compressed pressure of 10 bar All nine isomers exhibited NTC
behavior, while it was found that increased chain substitution
resulted in pronounced NTC along with decreased reactivity,
highlighting the increasing importance of (R3c) and (R5b), where
these compete more effectively with the isomerization steps due to
higher strain on the bond angles during hydrogen transfer. The order
of reactivity for the isomers was also shown to generally coincide
with the individual octane ratings. Di Sante [397] also measured
ignition delay times of stoichiometric n-heptane mixtures in air,
showing good agreement with those from Griffiths et al. [76] and
Silke et al. [396].

PKarwat et al. [228] conducted ignition delay and species meas-
urements for diluted stoichiometric n-heptane mixtures. Compari-
the experiments with a kinetic model showed poor
son of
agreement for several intermediates, particularly the heptane spe-
_
cies formed from reactions of the RO
O radicals. The intermediate
species profiles predicted by an updated kinetic model showed bet-
ter agreement with the measurements, and this again demonstrated
the benefit of including intermediate species profiles as additional
validation targets for kinetic model development and refinement.

PDi et al. [133] studied the effect of buffer (i.e., diluent) gas on the
reactivity of n-heptane. Two different gases were studied, including
nitrogen and argon. The buffer gas composition was found to
have no effect on t1, but the different specific heat capacities of
the diluents caused varying levels of pressure and temperature rise
due to LTHR. This, in turn, affected tign, with the use of argon as the
diluent resulting in substantially shorter overall
ignition delays
compared to nitrogen.

P6.2.10. isoOctane and PRF blends

PisoOctane, or 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane, has been used for many
years as a reference fuel for gasoline where its octane rating of 100
is used to establish the higher extremum of the octane scale. Its
highly branched configuration yields unique LTC behavior, while its
structure is also relevant as a fragment in the decomposition of
larger, highly branched hydrocarbons like the diesel reference fuel
2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethyl nonane (isocetane). Substantial experi-
mental and modeling work has been undertaken using isooctane as
a single- or two-component surrogate for gasoline, i.e., PRF blends,
in IC engines covering a range of conventional and LTC schemes.
Additionally, numerous measurements have been conducted within
RCM platforms. The extent of historical data and observed differen-
ces in some of the measurements also provided motivation to utilize
this fuel as the reference species for the RCM Workshop Characteri-
zation Initiative [62], some results of which were presented in Fig. 2.
PGriffiths et al. [368] used a reference temperature typical of that
experienced in the end gas of spark ignition engines under knocking
conditions, Tc D 900 K, to compare ignition delay times of the single-
component fuels which had the same RON to comparable PRF mix-
tures. Ignition delay times of some of the low octane fuels and their
corresponding PRF mixtures were shown to be in quantitative agree-
ment. However, the agreement became less satisfactory for fuels
with RONs higher than 85. The authors ascribed this difference to
the decreasing reactivity of the fuels. For the binary PRF mixtures
it was argued that appreciable reaction could occur during piston
compression, leading to a sensitization of the mixture in the post-
compression period at higher temperatures, whereas the single
component alkanes were not similarly reactive. These differences
were linked to the relative reactivities of the fuels and to charac-
teristics of reaction rates in the NTC regime, in the temperature
range of 750(cid:1)850 K. It was suggested that the minimum temper-
ature at which autoignition occurs within a given system, rather
than ignition delay time, might give a closer correlation of the
relationship between reactivity observed in RCMs and octane
numbers measured in operating engines. This idea has not been
explored to date, but would entail characterizing the thermo-
physical state of the gas over a wider range of conditions than
typically explored in RCMs, and could be subject to large uncer-
tainties, based on current understandings of gas motion and heat
loss phenomena. More recent work by Mehl et al. [403], and
Badra et al. [404] suggested that using a lower temperature and
higher pressure, e.g., Tc D 820 or 825 K and pc D 20 or 25 bar,
respectively, would enable better comparison between RON rat-
ings and RCM-measured tign.

PPark and Keck [102] measured ignition delays for stoichiometric
PRF/O2/N2/Ar mixtures with five blends including PRF100, 90, 75, 50,
and 0. It was found, consistent with the work of Griffiths et al. [368],

Pthat the ignition delays were not a linear function of octane rating. In
addition, for the experimental conditions utilized, t1 decreased signif-
icantly as the temperature increased, whereas tign stayed unchanged.
The authors also highlighted the importance of characterizing the
heat loss behavior of their configuration, as well as the procedures
used for mixture preparation when conducting RCM tests.

PMinetti et al. [222] measured ignition delay times and intermedi-
ate species concentrations during autoignition of stoichiometric iso-
octane/air. In general, the authors found that at the conditions
investigated isooctane was much less reactive than n-heptane,
which had a more significant two-stage ignition zone and required
much lower pressures to realize similar tign. Intermediate species
concentrations recorded using rapid gas sampling aided in under-
standing the low-temperature reaction pathways where the authors
highlighted the importance of b-scission reactions (R5b) in produc-
ing unsaturated species, such as methylpropene and substituted
pentenes, and noted that the primary stable oxygen containing het-
erocycle intermediates were tetrahydrofurans.

PTanaka et al. [395] measured ignition delay times of isooctane, as
well as PRF blends of 50, 75, and 90. For the fuels explored, the
authors attempted to uncover empirical relationships between tign,
Dp1, burn rates (defined as dp/dt at tign), ’, and octane rating. The
trends observed in the data were highly non-linear where tign was
found to be inversely proportional to Dp1, burn rate, and ’, and
directly proportional to octane rating.

PLim et al. [400] conducted RCM experiments for PRF blends of 0,
72, 82, 91, and 100. In many of their tests, LTHR occurred during the
compression stroke, so it was difficult to define t0. Additionally, as
the ‘loss of adiabaticity’ limit defined in Section 4 was reached for
some of the lean mixtures of low n-heptane content, autoignition
was quenched. Furthermore, the data were not displayed on a con-
ventional Arrhenius diagram so that trends from the pressure traces
had to be deduced. Nevertheless, their results showed that as the
n-heptane mixing ratio was decreased, both t1 and tign increased
while a slightly higher compressed temperature (»30 K) was
required to initiate LTHR. As well, as ’ increased, the extent of
LTHR, and thus Dp1 increased.

PHe et al. [271] measured ignition delay times of isooctane and
investigated the effect of addition of EGR species CO2 and H2O. Meas-
urements showed that H2O has a chemical effect, with ignition delays
decreasing with increasing water content, while CO2 was found to
have no effect for the conditions studied. The performance of various
kinetic mechanisms in predicting the ignition delay times was also
_
investigated. He et al. [243] further measured
OH concentrations
using narrow line absorption techniques, as discussed in Section 3,
and used these results to evaluate the significance of the rate con-
stants of important reactions, including H2O2 (+M) D _

PVanhove et al. [167] [398] studied ignition delay times of stoi-
chiometric isooctane/air mixtures, as well as mixtures of this fuel
with toluene and 1-hexene. It was found that isooctane was con-
verted to C8 intermediate products, including isooctenes and cyclic
ethers. In addition, it was noted that as isooctane is much less reac-
tive than n-heptane, the generation of a pool of radicals at low tem-
peratures requires higher pressure. The evolution of the ignition
delays with the addition of toluene or 1-hexene was found to be
highly non-linear, which was attributed to the formation of the
radical pool by the most reactive species.

PMittal and Sung [399] measured ignition delay times of isooc-
tane/O2/N2/Ar mixtures at, along with blends of isooctane and other
hydrocarbons, in order to understand the chemical kinetic interac-
tions between different fuel components. For binary fuel blends of
toluene and isooctane in particular, it was found that the variation of
ignition delay with the relative fuel proportion was highly nonlinear,
resulting in greatly enhanced reactivity even with a small addition of
isooctane to toluene. This finding correlated with results of octane

Ptesting performed by Morgan et al. [405] and ignition delay meas-
urements by Vanhove et al. [398].

PDi et al. [133] studied the influence of buffer gas on the autoigni-
tion characteristics of
isooctane in their study examining the
behavior of n-heptane. Three diluent gases were studied including
nitrogen, argon, and a mixture of argon and CO2. As with n-heptane,
using argon as the diluent resulted in similar t1 as compared to N2,
but shorter overall ignition delays, due to the larger Dp1 and temper-
ature rise of LTHR. Furthermore, the effect of third-body collision
efficiencies was probed by blending argon with CO2 such that the
specific heat nearly matched that of pure nitrogen. The authors con-
cluded that there was negligible effect due to the third-body colli-
sion efficiencies at their experimental conditions.

PZhang et al. [401] investigated two-stage ignition in the NTC
region for stoichiometric isooctane/O2/N2/Ar mixtures. It was found
that t1 was sensitive to O2 concentration, but was insensitive to the
dilution gas and fuel concentrations. A detailed model was used to
explain the cause of the NTC behavior, and this was predicted to be
due to the competition between (R5a), (R3c), (R5c) and (R2b), i.e.,
_
QOOH radical addition to O2,
the backward reaction of the second
_
_
OH, and the b-scission
RO

reactions of the alkyl radicals, respectively.

P6.2.11. Decane

PDecane is representative of some of the largest alkanes in gaso-
line, as well as some smaller components in jet fuel and diesel. There
has been only one study by Kumar et al. [402] using decane in an
RCM due to challenges associated with its high boiling point and
high reactivity. Dependence of t1 and tign on varying fuel concentra-
tions, oxygen mole fractions, pressure, and temperature were inves-
tigated in this study. tign was found to depend strongly on the
equivalence ratio and compressed gas pressure, but t1 depended pri-
marily on the compressed gas temperature and did not depend
strongly on ’ or pressure. In addition, through comparison to a
kinetic model, the decomposition of ketohydroperoxides via (R5a)
was shown to be important in both t1 and tign.

P6.2.12. Summary - alkanes

PThe understanding of LTC autoignition behavior for paraffinic
fuels has been developed over many years with the assistance of
successive RCM experiments. In order to expand this towards a com-
prehensive understanding of LTC autoignition, as well as the formu-
lation of fuel surrogates and the development of chemical kinetic
models for transportation liquid fuels, validation datasets of larger
alkanes beyond decane, such as dodecane and cetane, under engine
relevant conditions are needed. Several groups are currently con-
ducting RCM experiments towards those heavier hydrocarbons.

6.3. Cycloalkanes

PCycloalkanes, or naphthenes, can constitute a significant portion
of gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel, with larger fractions found in fuels
derived from non-traditional feed-stocks, e.g., shale oil, cellulosic-/
sugar-based biomass. The generally 5- and 6-membered ring struc-
tures of these components yield unique autoignition and pollutant
formation behavior compared to analogous straight and branched
chain alkanes, since ring opening and dehydrogenation processes
play important roles. Additional complexity in the chemistry arises
from multiple stable conformations of the cyclic structure for fuels
with ring sizes greater than six carbon atoms, and the influence
these conformations have on the internal isomerization reactions.
To date there has been little to no work reported investigating the
autoignition behavior of 5-membered ring naphthenes within RCMs,
while some studies have been conducted investigating 6-membered
ring fuels. A summary of the work performed on cycloalkanes is pro-
vided in Table 6, along with that on alkene and aromatic fuels.

P6.3.1. Cyclohexane

PLemaire et al. [83] studied the oxidation of cyclohexane to under-
stand the low-temperature pathways leading to the formation of
benzene. The oxidation characteristics of cyclohexene and cyclo-
hexa-1,3-diene were also investigated in this study. Cyclohexane
was found to exhibit two-stage ignition at low temperatures and sin-
gle-stage ignition at intermediate temperatures. NTC behavior was
evident at conditions investigated in this study. Pathways leading to
the formation of conjugated alkenes were observed to promote the
formation of benzene.

PVranckx et al. [406] reported ignition delay times of cyclohexane/
air mixtures and compared the measured values with those from
Lemaire et al. [83]. tign from [406] are consistently longer than those
in [83], where these significant differences were suggested to arise
partly from the longer compression time in [83] and higher heat
losses in [406]. Additionally, simulations were conducted to assess
the performance of three available kinetic models. All three models
were found to generally capture the autoignition characteristics of
cyclohexane but none of the mechanisms was observed to correctly
predict the measured tign over a wide temperature range. Sensitivity
analysis showed differences in the dominant reaction classes con-
trolling ignition for the three mechanisms which was due to the dif-
ferent reaction rates used in three mechanisms. The study of [406]
_
also identified the importance for further understanding the
QOOH
radical chemistry, e.g., (R5).

P6.3.2. Methylcyclohexane

PPitz et al. [407] measured tign of stoichiometric methylcyclohex-
ane (MCH) + oxidizer mixtures. MCH was found to exhibit two-stage
ignition behavior at low temperatures, and NTC behavior was also
observed. A detailed chemical kinetic model for MCH was developed
and the simulated ignition process was observed to be dependent on
the isomerization rates of methylcyclohexyl-peroxyl radicals (R3a).
_
Incorporation of isomerization rates of RO
O radicals resulted in lon-
ger ignition delays and the absence of NTC behavior. A kinetic model
using isomerization rates from Gulati and Walker [421] was found
to predict tign in reasonable agreement with measured values, along
with similar NTC behavior.

PMittal and Sung [408] measured ignition delay times of MCH/O2/
N2/Ar mixtures. In this work ’ was varied by changing the concen-
tration of oxygen at fixed MCH concentration (1.047%). t1 and tign
were found to depend significantly on oxygen concentration. Simu-
lations conducted using the MCH kinetic model developed by Pitz
et al. [407] predicted ignition delay times that were substantially dif-
ferent from the experimental measurements.

PWeber et al. [409] measured ignition delay times of MCH/O2/N2/
Ar mixtures at a higher compressed pressure of 50 bar A new chemi-
cal kinetic model of MCH was developed by updating the mechanism
of Pitz et al. [407] with new reaction pathways and more accurate
rate constants for many reactions, including (R1), (R2a), (R3a), (R5),
and (R8). The updated kinetic model was found to predict tign mea-
sured in [407(cid:1)409] with good agreement.

PIn the same study as that for isooctane discussed above, Zhang
et al. [401] investigated autoignition of lean (’ D 0.5) MCH/O2/N2/Ar
mixtures in the temperature range 702(cid:1)802 K at pc D 15 bar, where
two-stage ignition behavior was observed at Tc D 750(cid:1)785 K.

P6.3.3. Propylcyclohexane

PCrochet et al. [224] experimentally obtained tign of n-propylcy-
clohexane/air mixtures. Concentrations of 49 intermediate species
were also recorded using a rapid gas sampling technique and mass
spectrometry. The data indicated that a variety of bicyclic ethers, as
well as conjugated alkenes were formed during the first-stage igni-
tion period. In particular, 1-oxa-2-methylsprio[3,5]nonane and 1-
oxa-2-ethylspiro[2,5]octane, and 4-propylcyclohex-1-ene and 3-
propylcyclohex-1-ene were most abundant. The authors proposed

Pformation pathways for both classes of intermediates starting from
_
QOOH radicals, i.e., (R5b) and (R5c). Measured tign were com-
the
pared with high-pressure shock tube experiments and good agree-
ment was observed. Simulated ignition delay times, conducted using
a kinetic model of n-propylcyclohexane, were found to differ from
the experimental values by two orders of magnitude. These differen-
ces were attributed to the absence of low-temperature reaction
pathways in the model.

P6.3.4. Summary - cycloalkanes

POverall, the state of the art of understanding and simulations for
cycloalkanes significantly lag the development of paraffins. These
structures can indeed lead to increased complexity in the internal
isomerization reactions, and significantly affect the overall reactivity
of a multicomponent fuel. The large discrepancies between experi-
ments and models indicate that further work is clearly needed to
unravel the overall autoignition mechanism.

6.4. Alkenes

PAlkenes or olefins are present in petroleum-based fuels, with
especially significant quantities found in some renewable-based
fuels. Their autoignition behavior is substantially different from
saturated analogues, such that blending of fairly small amounts

P(5(cid:1)10% by volume) can alter the octane or cetane rating of a
fuel. Unfortunately, the PM and smog-forming potential of high
olefin fuels can be substantially greater than low olefin counter-
parts. Fundamentally, ethylene, propene, and larger alkenes are
important intermediates formed in the decomposition of many
fuels via (R3c) and (R5b). This section highlights features associ-
ated with double carbon bonds located within or branched from
the alkyl backbone, which affect the LTC behavior of these fuels,
through additional reaction pathways and formation of reso-
nance-stabilized allylic radicals that are not shown in Fig. 37.

PEthylene is typically not a component of liquid fuels, but as noted,
it is an important intermediate species formed due to b-scission
reactions of larger hydrocarbons. Additionally, it is a key intermedi-
ate in soot formation where its decomposition can lead to acetylene
which participates in the HACA (H-atom abstraction(cid:1)C2H2-addition)
mechanism. Kumar et al. [410] measured tign of diluted stoichiomet-
ric ethylene/oxidizer mixtures. Simulated tign using the Center for
Energy Research at the University of California at San Diego reaction
mechanism [422] exhibited good agreement with the experimental
data. Kinetic analyses demonstrated the importance of reactions
_
between ethylene and the H
O2 radical in the low-to-intermediate
temperature range.

also an important intermediate formed during combustion of larger

Pfuels, Burke et al. [411] recently conducted a series of tign measure-
ments in six different shock tubes and two RCMs covering a very
wide range of pressure and temperature. This study provided a basis
for extensive facility cross-comparisons for experimental tign, while
a large database was generated for model validation. Experimental
results were also compared to predictions of the chemical kinetic
mechanism developed in this study and good agreement was
observed.

PRecently, Zhou et al. [412] carried out a detailed experimental
and kinetic modeling investigation of the oxidation of isobutene.
This study included measurements of tign in shock tubes and RCMs,
laminar flame speeds, and speciation data measured in flow and jet-
stirred reactors. Based on chemical kinetic modeling it was found
that the reactivity of the alkene species at very low temperatures
_
(<800 K) is dominated by H
O2 addition reactions to the double bond
of the alkene followed by addition of O2 to the resulting radical. At
intermediate temperatures (800(cid:1)1300 K), the reactivity is con-
trolled by the competition between H-atom abstraction from the
_
alkene by O2 and
OH radicals with subsequent reaction between res-
_
onantly stabilized methyl-allyl radicals, and H
O2 resulting in chain
branching reactions. This work highlighted, similar to earlier studies
_
O2 combination
with larger alkenes which are discussed next, that H
reactions are critically important steps in the chain branching and
LTC oxidation of alkene fuels, and this is unique compared to alkane
combustion, as discussed above.

PRibaucour et al. [370] and Minetti et al. [81] compared the autoig-
nition behavior of 1-pentene and n-pentane and found that both fuels
showed two-stage ignition and NTC behavior, with 1-pentene being
less reactive. Details of this study are discussed in Section 6.2.7.

PVanhove et al. [84] investigated the autoignition chemistry of
stoichiometric mixtures of the three hexene isomers and discussed
the effect of the double bond position. Gas samples were also
extracted from the reactive mixtures and gas chromatography con-
ducted to analyze the composition of the sampled gas. Selectivities
of the main intermediates were reported, including C6 saturated O-
heterocycles, C6 saturated aldehydes and ketones, C6 unsaturated O-
heterocycles, C6 unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, hexadienes,
C2(cid:1)C5 saturated aldehydes, and C3(cid:1)C5 unsaturated aldehydes. Of the
three isomers of hexene, 1-hexene was found to be more reactive
while 3-hexene was found to be the least reactive. The NTC behavior
was more pronounced for 1-hexene while 3-hexene exhibited very
weak NTC behavior. The authors proposed pathways to the formation
of the major intermediate species based on analogy to the isomers of
_
pentane. Of particular influence was the addition of
O2 rad-
icals to the double bond, leading to epoxidation or scission of the
double bond, also discussed in [A3]. These features highlight the
influence of alkyl chain structure on the isomerization steps (R3a,
R5a) necessary for low-temperature ignition. In another study, Van-
hove et al. [398] measured the ignition delay times of stoichiometric
1-hexene/toluene, 1-hexene/isooctane, and 1-hexene/isooctane/tolu-
ene blends. Gas samples were extracted from the reactive mixtures
to understand the kinetic interactions between the hydrocarbons.

_
OH and H

PLemaire et al. [83] measured the ignition delay times of stoichio-
metric fuel/air mixtures of cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,3diene. In
their study, there was neither two-stage ignition or NTC behavior
observed for cyclohexa-1,3-diene. While cyclohexene behaved in an
intermediate way without a first-stage ignition, there existed a nar-
row, not very marked NTC region. Modeling work indicated that by
including addition of O2 to cyclohexenyl radicals (R2a) and the vari-
ous isomerizations of the resulting peroxyl radicals, most of the C6
products from cyclohexene could be predicted by the classical
scheme for low-temperature oxidation. However, as in [84], in order
_
to predict the formation of 1,2-epoxycyclohexane, addition of
OH and
_
H
O2 radicals to the double bond had to be included in the model. For
cyclohexa-1,3-diene, the classical scheme was found to be invalid, as
_
the C6 oxygenated products are only formed by addition of
OH and

_
PH
O2 radicals to the double bond. Furthermore, the pathways to ben-
zene are those leading to conjugated alkenes, which are more effi-
cient than those producing oxygenated products, either by adding
_
O2 to double bonds, or by addition of O2 to the initial cyclic radical.
H
PTanaka et al. [395] measured the ignition delay times of the
three linear heptene isomers in air under fuel lean conditions. Of
the three isomers, 1-heptene exhibited the shortest ignition delay
while 3-heptene exhibited the longest ignition delay. At their
experimental conditions, 1-heptene and 2-heptene both showed
two-stage ignition, though 3-heptene exhibited only single-stage
ignition behavior.

PIgnition delay times of diisobutylene-1 (DIB-1)/oxidizer mix-
tures and binary blends of DIB-1/toluene mixtures were measured
by Mittal and Sung [399]. It was shown that, consistent with the
work of Vanhove et al. [84], the inclusion of a double bond and
the location of its position can significantly alter the fuel ignition
characteristics.

P6.4.1. Summary - alkenes

PUnder low-to-intermediate-temperature conditions, the overall
chemical kinetic behavior of alkenes is a result of competition
between two channels (cid:1) reactions through hydrogen abstraction
_
from the alkyl chain, and in the main, the addition of
O2
radicals to the double bond [84]. When autoignition chemistry is
dominated by the reactivity of a double bond, alkenes do not exhibit
pronounced NTC behavior [84]. As highlighted in the study of Ribau-
cour et al. [370] covering the autoignition behavior of n-pentane and
_
1-pentene, the reactions involving direct addition of
O2 to
the double bond are the controlling steps. Therefore, the less pro-
nounced features of NTC behavior for alkenes, as compared to alka-
nes, indicate the addition reactions at the double bond dominate
over the peroxidation reactions of the alkenyl chain.

6.5. Aromatics

PAromatics are an important class of hydrocarbons within petro-
leum-derived fuels and their presence significantly influences auto-
ignition and heat release characteristics, as well as PM emissions.
The LTC behavior of fuels with high aromatic content can be quite
different than other fuels, even for blends with similar octane ratings
[423], and this can have significant implications for engine operation
and control, especially under LTC schemes.

P6.5.1. Benzene

PBeckers and Levedahl [413] studied the kinetics and mechanism
of rapid autoignition for benzene/air mixtures using an RCM and a
motored engine at the compressed conditions of 800 K and 20 bar in
the RCM, and 900 K and 40 bar in the engine. They found the kinetics
of the overall reaction can be described by a bimolecular rate equa-
tion with a low apparent activation energy near 11.6 kcal/mol
(48.53 kJ/mol). Furthermore, the motored engine tests revealed that
only 1.5% of the fuel molecules had decomposed, with 2- and 4-car-
bon acetylenes being the only hydrocarbon intermediates found.
Additional species detected included CO2, H2O, methanol, and HCHO
which were hypothesized to be oxidation products of acetylenes.
The lack of phenol derivatives indicated that the breaking of the ben-
zyl ring occurs very shortly after the first attack on the molecule,
which was in contrast to reported experiments at lower tempera-
tures, e.g., »600 K.

PMittal and Sung [414] reported tign for benzene/O2/N2/Ar mix-
tures. The mole fraction of benzene was fixed and the amount of
oxygen was varied in order to change ’. Simulations were also con-
ducted to examine the performance of various chemical kinetic
mechanisms for benzene, and these showed that none of the mecha-
nisms existing at the time succeeded in predicting the ignition delay
times with good agreement, where the apparent activation energies

Pof the models were much lower than observed in the experimental
measurements, and the ITHR was larger.

PThe co-oxidation of benzene in 50/50 mixtures with n-heptane
was reported by El Bakali et al. in [415]. Two-stage ignition was
observed in their RCM measurements, and qualitative analysis of the
intermediate products did not show the formation of aromatic prod-
ucts such as phenol, while a variety of products of n-heptane first-
stage reactivity were identified. The ignition delay results were com-
pared with predictions of a kinetic model developed by the authors,
showing overall good agreement.

P6.5.2. Alkyl substituted benzenes

PMittal and Sung [414] reported the ignition delay times of tolu-
ene/O2/N2/Ar. Experiments were conducted to understand the effects
of ’ and oxygen concentration on ignition delays. It was noted that
toluene was much more reactive than benzene under the same con-
ditions. The experimental results were compared to shock tube data
[424] to specifically analyze the ITHR. Under similar state conditions
and overall stoichiometry, but with 2.5 times greater fuel loading, i.
e., fuel mole fraction of 0.0228 compared to 0.00962, the shock tube
pressure records indicated substantially larger ITHR compared to the
RCM data. Mittal and Sung [414] argued that this could be due to
surface contamination in the shock tube experiments leading to non-
uniform, or mild ignition events, and presented evidence for this by
conducting tests where the RCM reaction chamber was intentionally
vitiated. Based on this, the apparently high ITHR in the shock tube
could have been due to deflagrative processes, or pre-ignition heat
release. Simulations of the experiments demonstrated that none of
the chemical kinetic mechanisms existing at the time succeeded in
predicting tign with good agreement. As with benzene, the apparent
activation energies were too low, while the ITHR appeared to be sig-
nificantly over-predicted by the models. Moreover, the various mod-
els
fuel consumption patterns, extents of
intermediates formed, and importance of different reactions.

indicated different

PDi Sante [397] measured ignition delay times of stoichiometric
n-heptane/toluene mixtures in air. Comparison of ignition delays for
pure n-heptane/air mixtures with those of n-heptane/toluene/air
mixtures showed that tign increased with increases in the amount of
toluene, while n-heptane chemistry dominates at low amounts of
toluene which is not surprising given the lower reactivity of toluene.
Ignition delay times obtained from numerical simulations conducted
using gasoline surrogate modeling from LLNL, validated notably on
the experimental results from [425] and [414], showed reasonable
agreement with experimental measurements.

PVanhove et al. [398] studied oxidation of n-heptane/toluene,
isooctane/toluene, 1-hexene/toluene binary blends and a three-
component surrogate gasoline fuel composed of 1-hexene/isooc-
tane/toluene. Ignition delays and intermediate species profiles were
measured using a gas sampling rig. tign was, as expected, observed
to increase nonlinearly with addition of toluene for the binary
blends at low temperatures. In addition, the apparent activation
energy in the NTC region was found to decrease with addition of tol-
uene to isooctane, hexane, and n-heptane. Speciation measurements
during the chemical induction times indicated that toluene is con-
verted to benzaldehyde and benzene, with trace concentrations of
cross reaction products such as ethylbenzene and heptenylbenzene
observed. Such cross reaction products have typically not been
detected in work using flow reactors operated in diluted regimes,
and this highlights interesting phenomena that may be present at
engine-relevant conditions. Additional data and investigation would
help resolve the contradictory implications of these datasets, and
the potential importance of such findings.

PThe high-pressure autoignition characteristics of binary fuel
blends of toluene/isooctane and toluene/DIB-1 were studied by
Mittal and Sung [399]. The relative proportion of the two fuels was
systematically varied in the binary blends, while the total fuel mole

Pfraction and ’ were kept constant. Experimental results showed that
the variation of tign with the relative fuel proportion was highly non-
linear, namely a small addition of isooctane or DIB-1 to toluene
resulted in greatly enhanced reactivity. Furthermore, the effect of
DIB-1 addition to toluene was seen to be more significant than the
stimulating effect of isooctane addition.

PRoubaud et al. [82,225,416] studied the autoignition characteristics
of 11 alkyl substituted benzenes to understand the effect of
substituent position and alkyl chain length on ignition delay character-
istics. The fuels included toluene, ethylbenzene, 2-ethyltoluene, n-pro-
pylbenzene, n-butylbenzene, xylene isomers, and trimethylbenzene
isomers. n-Butylbenzene and o-xylene were found to be the most
reactive. n-Butylbenzene was the only fuel that exhibited an NTC
behavior, while ignition delay times of o-xylene and 1,2,3 trimethyl-
benzene exhibited two-stage ignition and NTC behavior. The measure-
ments indicated that the fuel reactivity increases as the chain length
of the alkyl substitution increases, and the proximity of the substitu-
ents also increases the reactivity, since there is a greater capability for
intramolecular transformations leading to isomerization, e.g., (R3a).

PRoubaud et al. [225] recorded ignition delay times and intermedi-
ate species profiles during autoignition of n-butylbenzene, o-xylene,
and o-ethyltoluene. The intermediate species identified indicated
low-temperature pathways for alkyl substituted benzenes proceed-
ing through the formation of peroxy radicals (R2). Alkyl substituted
benzenes, in which isomerization of peroxy radicals is facilitated
(R3a), exhibit relatively higher reactivity. In poly-alkyl substituted
benzenes, substitution at the ortho site facilitates isomerisations
leading to chain branching at low temperatures. This explains the
trends observed in their earlier study [416], in which o-xylene and
1,2,3 trimethylbenzene were found to be reactive at low tempera-
tures. A detailed chemical kinetic model describing the autoignition
of n-butylbenzene was developed in Ribaucour et al. [82] which was
validated based on ignition delays and intermediate species concen-
trations, where the kinetic model predictions were found to agree
well with the experimental values.

PDarcy et al. [417] studied the autoignition of n-propylbenzene.
These RCM data were compared with and complemented shock
tube ignition delay data which had previously been recorded
under similar conditions of pressure and ’ [426]. Where overlap-
ping data existed, very good agreement was observed between
tign measured in the shock tube and the RCM facilities. The
experimental data were simulated using an updated detailed
chemical kinetic model, which included reactions in the low-
temperature oxidation regime with special attention given to
_
RO
O2 elimination (R3c) reactions
involving the secondary benzylic site on n-propylbenzene in
order to obtain good agreement with the experimental results.

PHusson et al. [418] studied the oxidation of n-butylbenzene in
various experimental facilities and developed a detailed chemical
kinetic model. Measurements included ignition delay times from an
RCM and a shock tube, as well as intermediate species from RCM
and JSR studies. Ignition delay times measured in the RCM comple-
mented well the data from the shock tube. Simulated results using
the detailed mechanism showed satisfactory agreement, while
chemical kinetic analyses demonstrated the importance of O2 addi-
tion to resonantly stabilized, 4-phenylbut-4-yl radicals (R2a).

PNakamura et al. [419] studied the autoignition of n-butylbenzene.
Similar to the study of Darcy et al. [417], the data were compared
with previously published shock tube ignition delay data [426]. The
RCM data were at lower temperatures, while the shock tube data
covered higher temperatures. Where overlap existed, good agree-
ment between the RCM and shock tube data was observed. A
detailed chemical kinetic mechanism including low-temperature
reactions was developed and used to simulate the data, and gener-
ally good agreement was observed between the model and the
experiments. Due to the overlapping conditions studied for both

Pn-propylbenzene [417] and n-butylbenzene [419], the results can be
directly compared. It was observed, both experimentally and with
model predictions, that the two fuels showed similar reactivity at
high temperatures (>1000 K), but n-butylbenzene was faster to
ignite compared to n-propylbenzene at
temperatures
(650(cid:1)1000 K). This is consistent with the findings of Roubaud et al.
[82,225,416]. The higher reactivity of n-butylbenzene compared to
n-propylbenzene is due to the longer n-butyl alkyl chain, allowing
_
for more facile RO
OOQOOH radical isomerization reactions,
(R3a) and (R6a), respectively.

P6.5.3. Other aromatics

PKukkadapu et al. [420] studied the autoignition of tetralin
(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene). The authors noted some ITHR
behavior at the lowest temperature experiments they conducted,
although no two-stage ignition or NTC behavior was found. The mea-
sured ignition delays were compared to an existing kinetic model
and relatively poor agreement was found. This was attributed to the
lack of low-temperature chemistry in the model, such as those steps
illustrated in Fig. 37.

P6.5.4. Summary - aromatics

PThere are still, to this day, large uncertainties linked to the kinetic
rate constants associated with aromatics autoignition. These struc-
tures lead to resonance-stabilized radicals, undergo radical addition
channels and can significantly affect the overall reactivity of a multi-
component fuel because of their increased complexity. These uncer-
tainties tend to play a smaller role for larger, single-ring molecules,
since the presence of a long alkyl chain tends to drive the reactivity.

6.6. Oxygenates

POxygenates are a special class of fuels that consists of alcohols,
esters, ethers, and ketones. They do not occur naturally in natural

Studies of oxygenated fuels using RCMs.

Pgas or petroleum reservoirs, but are often added to refined fuels for
a variety of reasons. Oxygenates can alter the octane or cetane rating
of a fuel, while they can also improve combustion performance
within engines so that lower CO, UHCs, and PM emissions can result
[326,427]. Oxygenates can be derived from renewable bio-feed-
stocks and thus hold interest as a means to reduce the impact of car-
bon dioxide emissions. Data from a variety of high-pressure devices
indicate that the mechanisms of oxygenate autoignition are con-
trolled by chemical oxidation routes involved in the oxygen moiety,
however as the fuel molecular weight increases without additional
oxygen, they become more dominated by the same mechanisms
involved in hydrocarbon autoignition. A summary of studies on oxy-
genated fuels is provided in Table 7.

P6.6.1. Alcohols

PAlcohols can be produced directly from biomass via fermentation
or gasification processes. Bio-alcohols typically include alcohols up
to C6 with a single hydroxyl group, and which have identified biolog-
ical production pathways. Larger molecules have also been investi-
gated in combustion engines as second-generation biofuels [427].
The combustion chemistry of these fuels has been reviewed recently
by Sarathy et al. [326], including steps relevant to autoignition.

P6.6.1.1. Methanol.
PLee et al. [428] studied the oxidation of alcohols
and ethers in an RCM. Although the measured tign data for methanol
were slightly lower than predicted values using reported reaction
mechanisms, the experimental and predicted values for the activa-
tion energy were in very good agreement at around 184 kJ/mol.

PKumar and Sung [429] investigated the autoignition of methanol.
By comparison to existing kinetic models, the authors found tign
were under-predicted by an order of magnitude. To ascertain possi-
ble reasons for the large discrepancies, a sensitivity analysis was
conducted. They found methanol autoignition to be most sensitive

_
PH-atom abstraction by H
O2 radicals. Updating the rate of this reac-
tion with a rate expression from the literature improved the model
predictions at low temperatures dramatically, while there was no
significant change in the mechanism performance at high tempera-
tures as a consequence of the modification.

PMost recently, a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was
used to simulate tign measured for methanol oxidation over a
wide range of pressures and ’ using both an RCM and a shock
tube [430]. At some conditions there was overlap in the experi-
mental conditions where it was found that the tign data in both
facilities agreed with one another. This work further demon-
strated the effective use of RCMs in measuring tign at longer
times than would otherwise be available allowing for the explo-
ration of lower temperature conditions.

P6.6.1.2. Ethanol.
PIn the RCM study of Lee et al. [428], there were five
data points reported for stoichiometric ethanol mixtures. The mea-
sured activation energy for ethanol autoignition was in good agree-
ment with previous shock tube results of 130 kJ/mol, despite tign
predicted by the shock tube correlation being a factor of three lower
than the measured values. Lee et al. [431] followed this with more
expansive tests, again using ethanol at stoichiometric conditions.
The measured ignition delays in this study were used to develop an
updated kinetic model for the combustion of ethanol, with good
agreement shown between the data and the model.

PMittal et al. [432] studied the autoignition of ethanol over a wide
range of stoichiometry, where ’ was changed by changing the oxy-
gen mole fraction at constant fuel mole fraction. The authors com-
pared their measurements to predictions from several kinetic
models and updated one recent model with new rates for the
_
C2H5OH + H
O2 reactions. These updates substantially improved the
agreement with the data measured in this study, while not affecting
agreement with data from previous work.

P6.6.1.3. Propanol.
PSurprisingly, there have been no experimental
RCM studies using propanol, as highlighted in [326], even though
the chemical kinetic pathways for propanol ignition at LTC condi-
tions are relevant to the autoignition behavior of larger alcohols.

P6.6.1.4. Butanol.
PWeber and co-workers [260,433] investigated the
autoignition of four butanol isomers (n-, iso-, sec- and t-). Further,
Weber et al. [433] determined the dependence of tign of n-butanol
on the initial fuel and oxygen concentrations by independently
varying these to adjust ’. No evidence of an NTC region or two-
stage ignition was found for any of the isomers. However, t-butanol
exhibited unique ITHR, which Weber and Sung [260] attributed
to different ignition chemistry in t-butanol as compared to the
other butanol isomers. The authors found that ITHR, which was not
associated with NTC behavior, increased with decreasing tempera-
ture and increasing ’. They hypothesized that this exothermicity
in part, to O2 addition to the fuel radical to form
was due,
b(cid:1)hydroxybutylperoxy, because only b(cid:1)hydroxybutyl radicals form
from t-butanol. The other isomers form primarily a-radicals that
_
tend to react with O2 to directly form H
O2 and an aldehyde. n-Buta-
nol was found to be the most reactive of the butanol isomers due to
_
O chemistry, but the order of reactivity of the other three
its facile RO
butanol isomers was shown to be dependent on pressure. In particu-
lar, t-butanol was the least reactive at 15 bar, but became the second
most reactive at 30 bar, behind only n-butanol.

PKarwat et al. [217] measured tign of stoichiometric n-butanol
mixtures. Comparison to a kinetic model [444] found good agree-
ment with the experiments in this study. Karwat and co-workers
further measured time-resolved species profiles during the induc-
tion period at approximately 900 K and 3 bar [217] and n-butanol/
n-heptane mixtures at approximately 9 bar and 700 K [228], using a
custom built rapid sampling apparatus described in Section 3. They

Pwere able to identify and quantify the mole fractions of important
intermediate species, including n-butanol, methane, carbon monox-
ide, ethene, propene, acetaldehyde, 1-butene, and n-butyraldehyde
[217]; and n-heptane, methanol, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde,
methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene,
1-hexene, 1,3-butadiene, 3-heptene, 2-heptene, n-butyraldehyde,
and carbon monoxide [228]. Karwat et al. [217] also compared their
n-butanol speciation results to the mechanism of Black et al. [444]
and found the model was able to predict the time-dependent mole
fraction of most intermediates with reasonable accuracy, though
ethene was a notable exception. When studying the blends of
n-butanol/n-heptane, Karwat et al. [228] found that n-butanol signif-
icantly reduced the formation of large unsaturated hydrocarbons
from n-heptane oxidation, indicating the synergistic effect that fuel
blending creates. Karwat et al. [228] further compared their n-buta-
nol/n-heptane speciation results with a custom model, including
sub-mechanisms for n-butanol from Sarathy et al. [445], n-heptane
from Mehl et al. [446], and C1(cid:1)C4 chemistry from Metcalfe et al.
[363]. They found the model was largely able to predict the mole
fractions of most major species, but intermediates such as n-butyral-
dehyde were strongly over-predicted [228].

PKumar et al. [434] studied the influence of blending n-butanol on
the ignition delay times of n-heptane and isooctane. The effect of
n-butanol addition on the development of the two-stage ignition for
n-heptane and isooctane was also illustrated. Experimental results
showed that the addition of n-butanol to n-heptane leads to a
decrease in overall reactivity, as manifested by the increase in both
t1 and tign for all the conditions studied. On the other hand, the
addition of n-butanol to isooctane was found to lead to shorter tign.
In addition, the experimental results were compared to predictions
simulated using a detailed chemical kinetic model, which was
obtained by systematically merging previously reported base models
for the individual fuel constituents. This compiled model was found
to generally well predict the qualitative and quantitative trends for
the autoignition of the binary fuel blends, although some discrepan-
cies between experiments and simulations for n-butanol/isooctane
blends were noted. A sensitivity analysis on the base and merged
models was further performed to understand the dependence of tign
on the model parameters.

PRecently, Ji et al. [233] measured both tign and intermediate spe-
cies formed during lean, isobutanol autoignition. Fast sampling and
gas chromatography were used to acquire and quantify the interme-
diate species during the induction period. The ignition delay times
and quantitative measurements of the mole fraction time histories
of methane, ethene, propene, isobutene, isobutyraldehyde, isobuta-
nol, and carbon monoxide were compared with predictions from the
detailed mechanisms developed by Sarathy et al. [445], Merchant
et al. [447], and Cai et al. [448]. It was shown that while the Sarathy
et al. mechanism predicted tign well, it over-predicted ethane con-
centrations by a factor of 6(cid:1)10, under-predicted isobutene by a
factor of 2, and over-predicted isobutyraldehyde by a factor of 2.

P6.6.1.5. Larger alcohols.
PTsujimura et al. [38,435] and Sarathy et al.
[436] measured tign of isopentanol over a range of ’ in air. ITHR
behavior similar to t-butanol [260] was found at 40 bar for isopenta-
nol [436]. Comparison with an updated model showed ignition
delays were accurately predicted for the stoichiometric condition,
but the model was unable to capture ’ dependence [436]. On the
other hand, the model was able to qualitatively capture the ITHR
behavior. Similar to isobutanol, the primary radical formed via H-
atom abstraction is the a-radical, leading primarily to the formation
of an aldehyde and hydroperoxyl radical. However, sufficient chain-
branching involving the g- and d-radicals is present to produce the
observed ITHR behavior, in contrast to the smaller butanol isomers.

PHeufer et al. [437] measured the ignition delay times of several
n-alkanes and n-alcohols, including n-pentanol and n-hexanol in

Pan RCM and a shock tube. The authors noted that n-pentanol and
n-hexanol both exhibit the typical alkane NTC behavior. By compari-
son to the corresponding alkane of the same carbon chain length,
the authors concluded normal alcohols are more reactive than nor-
mal alkanes in the high-temperature regime, but less reactive in the
low-to-intermediate temperature regime. The authors attributed
this to the effect of the alcohol group which reduces the bond disso-
ciation energy of the C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds corresponding to the carbon atom
nearest the alcohol group. At high temperatures, this reduction in
bond dissociation energy contributes to the reactivity by offering a
fast path for H-abstraction and quick formation of fuel radicals (R1).
However, at low-to-intermediate temperatures, the radicals formed
by this fast H-atom abstraction in turn form aldehydes instead of
_
QOOH radicals through (R3c), reducing the reactivity in comparison
to alkanes. Furthermore, the effect of the alcohol group is diminished
as the carbon chain length increases, indicating that for very long
carbon chains, negligible influence of the alcohol group might be
expected, especially for straight chain alkyl structures with the
hydroxyl group at the end position.

P6.6.2. Esters

PEsters are fuels that are structurally representative of biodiesel,
which can be produced directly from the trans-esterification of seed
oils, such as soybean and palm. This process is typically facilitated
using a small alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, so long chain (C12
and larger) methyl, or ethyl esters respectively result from the con-
version. Studies undertaken to date, within RCMs as well as other
laboratory devices, have investigated much smaller ester molecules,
such as C5 esters, as the low vapor pressures of these fuels and their
tendency to stick to the walls of the equipment hampers the use of
larger, lower volatility compounds.

PVranckx et al. [438] measured ignition delay times of stoichio-
metric mixtures of n-butyl formate. The same study also reported
ignition delay measurements from a shock tube and laminar flame
speed results. n-Butyl formate was found to exhibit two-stage igni-
tion and NTC behavior. The RCM measurements were found to com-
plement shock tube data, and the simulated ignition delay times and
laminar flame speeds using the kinetic model developed in this
study also showed good agreement.

PDooley et al. [439] measured tign of methyl butanoate. The tign
data exhibited Arrhenius behavior and no evidence of an NTC
regime. A chemical kinetic model was also developed in this study
and validated with data from other fundamental reactors, and this
was found to emulate the qualitative behavior of the ignition delays,
but the simulated tign differed substantially and further improve-
ments were needed.

PWalton et al. [231] measured tign of methyl butanoate and ethyl
propanoate. Ethyl propanoate was found to be more reactive than
methyl butanoate. A detailed kinetic model was developed in this
study and was found to predict tign of methyl butanoate with excel-
lent agreement while ethyl propanoate predictions were not as
good. Walton et al. [230] in a later study conducted rapid sampling
experiments to perform speciation measurements during autoigni-
tion of methyl butanoate. Evolution profiles of methane, ethane, eth-
ene, propene, and 1-butene were recorded. The kinetic model
developed in these studies was found to predict methane and ethene
concentrations with excellent agreement, while comparison of eth-
ane, propene, and 1-butene were not as good.

PHadjAli et al. [226] measured ignition delay times of C4(cid:1)C8
methyl esters to understand the influence of the chain length on the
ignition of methyl esters. Ignition delay measurements showed that
reactivity increases with increases in chain length for the conditions
investigated. Methyl pentanoate, methyl hexanoate, and methyl
heptanoate exhibited two-stage ignition behavior. Further tests
were conducted to understand the characteristics of methyl esters
which included comparison of ignition delays with those of n-

Palkanes and intermediate species measurements. Methyl hexanoate
was chosen as the representative for methyl esters. Comparison of
ignition delay times showed the following reactivity order: n-hep-
tane > methyl hexanoate > n-pentane > n-butane. t1 and tign of
methyl hexanoate were found to be shorter than those of n-pentane,
indicating the methyl ester functional group has a promoting effect
on low-temperature chemistry. Information on the intermediate
species formed during the induction period aided in understanding
the controlling reaction pathways. Proposed routes were con-
structed to yield observed methyl epoxyhexanoates, methyl hexe-
noates, and small unsaturated methyl esters + aldehydes that form
_
via O(cid:1)O, C(cid:1)O, and C(cid:1)C scission, respectively, of the
QOOH species,
(R5b) and (R5c). It was highlighted that most measured intermedi-
ates were formed by abstraction of the C2(cid:1)(cid:1)H bond, followed by
internal H-atom transfer from the 3, 4, 5 or 7 carbon, or H-atom
abstraction from the 3, 4, 5 or 7 carbon with H-transfer from the
C2(cid:1)(cid:1)H bond.

P6.6.3. Ethers

PEthers are typically produced via catalytic reformation or dehy-
dration of alcohols. The molecular structure of the alcohol dictates
the type of ether that is formed. Some ethers, e.g., dimethyl ether
(DME), have been suggested as direct replacements for diesel fuel.

PMTBE has been used a gasoline additive to reduce emissions and
enhance octane rating. Lee et al. [428] conducted RCM experiments
for stoichiometric MTBE mixtures. The measured activation energy
of 173 kJ/mol was found to be higher than the value of 117 kJ/mol
reported in the shock tube study of Curran et al. [449]. The work of
Lee et al. [428] demonstrated that the oxygenated fuels tested
(methanol, ethanol, and MTBE) are more resistant to autoignition as
compared to primary reference fuels.

PMittal et al. [275] measured ignition delay times of DME, in which
’ was varied by changing the oxygen concentration while keeping
fuel loading constant. DME was found to exhibit two-stage ignition
and NTC behavior. t1 was observed to be less sensitive to pressure
and ’. On the other hand, tign was observed to increase with equiva-
lence ratio, as the fuel loading was fixed and the oxygen concentra-
tion decreased with increase in ’ highlighting the importance of O2
concentration relative to ’. Simulations conducted using a DME
mechanism showed good agreement with the experimental findings.
Additional analyses using novel computational singular perturbation
techniques indicated that chemical species formed during the piston
compression process, even with negligible evolved exothermicity,
can considerably affect the autoignition observations. These results
emphasized the importance of constructing physically and chemi-
cally realistic simulation frameworks for the experiments, as dis-
cussed in Section 4.

PUsing an RCM and three different shock tubes, Burke et al. [351]
provided experimental and chemical kinetic model-predicted igni-
tion delay time data for DME/methane blends, pure DME, and pure
methane covering a range of conditions relevant to gas turbine envi-
ronments. By incorporating high-level rate constant measurements
and calculations available for the reactions of DME, and applying a
pressure-dependent treatment to the low-temperature reactions of
DME, the detailed chemical kinetic model developed in this study
was capable of accurately predicting this wide range of ignition
delay data, as well as available literature data including flow reactor,
JSR, shock tube ignition delay times, shock tube speciation, laminar
flame speed, and flame speciation results.

PAs mentioned earlier in the discussion of propane oxidation,
recently Dames et al. [364] studied binary mixtures of propane and
DME using an RCM with a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism anal-
ysis. Stoichiometric mixtures in air were used for pure propane and
pure DME mixtures in addition to various mixture blends comprising
90/10, 75/25, 50/50, and 25/75 propane/DME. It was found that pro-
pane was slowest to ignite, while the mixtures containing higher

Pconcentrations of DME were progressively faster in igniting. Much of
the kinetics of the propane/DME mixtures was predicted to be con-
trolled by the underlying DME chemistry. It was found that including
_
the pressure-dependent unimolecular decomposition of the CH3O

better agreement between the model and the experimental results. It
was also concluded that even though many cross reactions between
stable and radical species involved in the propane/DME sub-mecha-
nisms were included, they did not have a measurable effect on most
simulations. This suggested that important cross reactions that do
_
_
O2 radicals formed during the
OH and H
occur involve competition for
combustion process.

OCH2OCHO D HOCHO +H

PThese trends were further corroborated by Zhang et al. [440], who
investigated binary blends of DME and toluene using a high pressure
shock tube and an RCM. Ignition delay time data were acquired cov-
ering a range of ’, pressure and DME/toluene blend ratios, including
100/0, 74/26, 42/58, 24/76 and 0/100, respectively, where DME blend-
ing was used to facilitate investigation of toluene oxidation at NTC
conditions. They observed that the reactivity of the mixtures with
low toluene fractions was dominated by DME oxidation processes,
but at the 24/76 blend ratio, the global ignition processes shifted to
be controlled more by toluene than DME. Furthermore, simulations
with an updated kinetic model, extended to include possible cross
_
reactions between the two fuel-derived radicals and
OH-toluene addi-
tion reactions, exhibited significant discrepancies with the experi-
mental measurements, underscoring uncertainties in the chemical
kinetics and thermodynamics in existing toluene oxidation pathways
in the model, as well as the possible exclusion of necessary oxidation
pathways. Nonetheless, as was found by Dames et al. [364], and
somewhat in contrast to the gas sampling work of Vanhove et al.
[398], the model indicated that the only interactions between the
_
two fuels were via competition for the
O2 radical pools,
where toluene's ability to act as a radical sink (and by extention, an
anti-knock agent in operating engines) can be traced to its weak
_
allylic C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bond, the subsequent reactions of C6H5
CH2 radical, and
the lack of a rapid oxidation mechanism for this at LTC conditions.
Model discrepencies found in this work, and with other experimental
observations highlight the need for continued study in this area.

P6.6.4. Other oxygenates: ethylene oxide, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl
carbonate

PGriffiths and Perche [441] studied the spontaneous decomposi-
tion, oxidation and autoignition of ethylene oxide (i.e., oxiran) under
rapid compression. Ethylene oxide is the simplest epoxide, and is
isomeric with acetaldehyde and vinyl alcohol. Dilute mixtures
(1.25(cid:1)5.0% ethylene oxide) in argon were studied with added
amounts of oxygen (0.88%, 2.5%, and 3.75%). Pressure-time profiles
and emitted light intensities were recorded, while mixture composi-
tions were measured using mass spectrometry. It was found that
trace amounts of oxygen enhanced the rate and extent of reaction of
fuel. With approximately equal amounts of ethylene oxide and oxy-
gen, ignition occurred at conditions where none was possible in the
absence of oxygen, while tign also became significantly shorter.
Product compositions of ethylene oxide pyrolysis and oxidation
were reported and these included acetaldehyde, methane, ethane,
ethylene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water.
It was found that fuel decomposition occurred rapidly at tempera-
tures of 850 K and higher and that it was highly exothermic
(>100 kJ/mol), in contrast to acetaldehyde which was found to be
almost thermo-neutral, with decomposition only occurring at tem-
peratures greater than 1000 K. The results showed that small
amounts of ethylene oxide in air can be a potential explosion hazard
if modest but adiabatic compression occurs.

PVanhove et al. [442] performed an experimental and modeling
study of tetrahydrofuran at low temperatures using an RCM and JSR.
Two-stage ignition was observed within the RCM at temperatures
up to 810 K, and the evolution of tign with temperature demon-
strated a clear deviation from Arrhenius behavior in the temperature
range 680(cid:1)750 K. The JSR measurements, which were conducted at
1 bar and highly diluted conditions, corroborated the RCM data in
that an NTC zone was observed in the temperature range of
600(cid:1)750 K. Reactive mixtures were sampled from the RCM indicat-
ing the formation of C1¡C4 aldehydes and alkenes, a variety of oxy-
genated heterocycles, including oxirane, methyloxirane, oxetane,
furan, both isomers of dihydrofuran, 1,4-dioxene and butyrolactone,
as well as cyclopropane carboxaldehyde, formic acid, 2-propenyl
ester and butanedial. Speciated samples from the JSR, however, indi-
cated discrepancies with the RCM measurements where many of the
aforementioned oxygenated intermediates were not detected, while
methylvinylether and dihydrofuranols were observed. The differen-
ces between the results for the two experimental platforms indicate
that the relative significance of reaction pathways may differ
between RCM and JSR devices, and this highlights the importance of
conducting autoignition chemistry studies across a wide range of
conditions, including at high pressures and undiluted concentrations
that are representative of IC engine operation. Furthermore, they
emphasize the need for complementary datasets that can provide
insight into fuel reactivity, such as the possible evolution of cross
reactions between fuel components.

PNakamura et al. [443] measured tign for diethyl carbonate (DEC)
using both an RCM and a shock tube. The data were complemented
by speciation data measured in a JSR. The RCM results showed near-
NTC behavior and relatively low reactivity in the low-temperature
regime (660(cid:1)900 K) and these results were interpreted using a
chemical kinetic model. Analysis indicated that the chemical struc-
ture of DEC does not result in six- and seven-membered ring alkyl-
peroxyl radical isomerization reactions (R3a), but that 5-, 8-, and 9-
membered ring isomerization reactions are possible. Six-membered
ring isomerization reactions are thought to initiate low-temperature
branching reactions leading to high reactivity in the low-tempera-
ture regime, and thus the lack of these (and seven-membered ring
isomerization reactions) resulted in the reduced reactivity of DEC at
low temperatures.

6.7. Full-boiling range fuels

PFull-boiling range fuels are liquid fuels that consist of a diverse
mix of hydrocarbon species which cover a wide range of molecular
weights and isomeric structures. The distillation curves for such
fuels span a large range of temperature where the difference
between initial and final boiling points can be on the order of 100 to
200 K [450,451]. Gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel are included within
this classification. There are numerous challenges associated with
utilizing these fuels in RCMs, as well as other experimental appara-
tuses including preferential distillation, cracking, and contamina-
tion, along with greater susceptibility to perturbations within the
reaction chamber, e.g.,
thermal gradients. Moreover, chemical
kinetic modeling of the experiments requires the use of single or
multi-component surrogates, which may not be representative of
the real fuels. Discussions of these issues can be found in various
review papers (e.g., [324,452,453]). Nevertheless, it is often desirable
to have direct data from the real fuel as well as surrogate blends at
representative conditions, as opposed to just surrogate model com-
parisons, in order to understand differences and similarities between
such representative surrogate blends and the real fuels.

P6.7.1. Gasoline and its surrogates

PGasoline contains hydrocarbons that typically range from C4 to
C12, where octane ratings generally fall within RON (cid:3) 80(cid:1)95. Like

Pmany full-boiling range fuels, gasoline is compositionally variant,
meaning its chemical content varies significantly from source to
source, and season to season. While an octane rating may be speci-
fied for a particular batch, this metric, as highlighted in the work of
Griffiths et al. [368] and others, is not an adequate indicator of the
autoignition characteristics of a fuel at LTC conditions. As such, com-
parison of experimental results between studies using different gas-
olines, IC engine based or otherwise, is not always straightforward.
A summary of RCM studies performed on gasoline and its surrogates
is provided in Table 8.

PKim et al. [111] measured the ignition delay times of a commer-
cial gasoline (RON » 92) and two, three-component, Toluene Refer-
ence Fuel (TRF) surrogate blends containing isooctane, n-heptane,
and toluene. One surrogate blend (identified as A) was based on the
work of Gauthier et al. [458] and formulated at 63/17/20 (liquid vol-
ume ratio). The estimated RON/MON rating for surrogate A was
88.8/84.8 [405]. A second blend (identified as B) was proposed by
the authors at 54/22/24 (liquid volume ratio), where this had a lower
estimated RON/MON rating of 84.9/82.6. The measured ignition
delay times of the surrogate B more closely matched results with the
commercial gasoline, whereas the surrogate A formulation yielded
ignition delay times that were approximately 30(cid:1)50% longer.
The surrogate A measurements were in good agreement with the
shock tube data of Gauthier et al. [458], and it is unclear why
the commercial gasoline was more reactive than the A surrogate,
even though its RON rating was significantly higher. The experi-
mental data were also compared with simulations using a
reduced kinetic mechanism which included the main reaction
pathways for isooctane, n-heptane, and toluene. The simulations
indicated that under some conditions there could be significant
consumption of
the isooctane and n-heptane fuel molecules
before the test conditions are reached, while the toluene was
predicted to hardly decompose. This is similar to the findings of
Griffiths et al. [368]. The model did not appear to adequately
capture the preliminary heat release seen in the experiments.

PIgnition delay times of a research grade gasoline, RD387 (RON
D 91, MON D 82.7), were measured by Kukkadapu et al. [454] over a
wide range of conditions. The tign measurements for this study were
also found to complement the earlier shock tube data from Gauthier
et al. [458], though the temperature conditions did not directly over-
lap. Furthermore, simulated ignition delay times using the gasoline
surrogate model from LLNL were found to exhibit good agreement
with the experiments. Although some model improvements were
still needed, the level of agreement was encouraging, considering
the complexity of the associated chemistry for fully blended gaso-
line. A discrepancy in the slope of the NTC region was noted and
could be attributed to the lack of fidelity of the surrogate model and/
or the inadequacy of the surrogate formulation in question. Further
studies were therefore suggested to identify whether this discrep-
ancy was due to the surrogate model being more reactive in the NTC
regime, or the absence of naphthenes in the gasoline surrogate.

PIn subsequent work, Kukkadapu et al. [455,456] measured the
ignition delay times of two surrogates of RD387. One was a TRF
blend (A from [458]), while the other was a four-component TRF/2-

Ppentene blend, with this formulation intended to account for the
olefinic content of the RD387 (»4.7%). No cycloalkanes were used in
the four-component surrogate, though the RD387 contained 16%
naphthenes. The authors estimated the RON/MON rating of the TRF/
2-pentene blend to be 91/83 based on the work of Mehl et al. [459].
Comparison of the measured ignition delays of two gasoline surro-
gates with those of RD387 reported in [454] showed the four-com-
ponent surrogate performed better in emulating the autoignition
characteristics of RD387. The performance of the LLNL gasoline sur-
rogate model was also assessed and noted to be pressure dependent.
Furthermore, the agreement between the experimental and simu-
lated results was found to depend on the operating conditions. Good
agreement was observed at a compressed pressure of 20 bar, while
longer ignition delays were predicted by the chemical kinetic
model at 40 bar. Chemical kinetic analyses were further conducted
at varying pressures, temperatures, and ’ to identify the reactions
that influence simulated ignition delay times. It was found that t1
were very sensitive to the H-atom abstraction reactions from isooc-
tane, as well as the successive concerted elimination reactions pro-
_
O2 (R3c), and the b-scission reactions of hydroperoxy alkyl
ducing H
radicals (R5b) and (R5c). As is often the case in these systems, the
_
O2 D H2O2 + O2
production and decomposition of H2O2 via H
and H2O2 (+M) D _
_
OH (+M), respectively, were found to be
important in controlling tign.

PSarathy et al. [457] compared ignition delay times of two gasoline
fuels and their conventional two-component PRF surrogate. Two
non-oxygenated, alkane-rich FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion
Engines) gasoline fuels [460], namely FACE A and FACE C, were used.
PRF84 was chosen because the octane ratings of FACE A and FACE C
are identical with RON D MON D 84. The study intended to examine
whether two gasoline fuels with similar octane ratings but different
chemical composition exhibited identical
reactivity and also
whether a simple PRF can emulate the autoignition behavior of gaso-
line with a similar octane rating. Ignition delay times of the gasoline
fuels and PRF84 were measured in both an RCM and shock tubes.
The measurements showed both gasoline fuels exhibited identical
ignition delays over a wide range of temperatures and that PRF84
could emulate the reactivity of these gasolines at temperatures in
the NTC and high-temperature regime. PRF84 however, was found
to be more reactive than the gasolines at the lowest temperatures.
Furthermore, a six-component surrogate blend was also proposed to
model the FACE A and C fuels which included n-butane, n-heptane,
isopentane, 2-methyhexane,
isooctane, and toluene, though no
experimental measurements were reported with the surrogate mix-
ture. The results of this work are somewhat contradictory to that of
Griffiths et al. [368], and may be due to the more complex makeup
of the full-boiling range fuels, compared to the single component
hydrocarbons studied in [368].

P6.7.2. Jet fuel and its surrogates

PJet fuel has a typical range of hydrocarbons from C8 to C16, which
makes it heavier than gasoline, with a molecular weight of
140(cid:1)180 g/mol compared to 90(cid:1)105 g/mol for gasoline. It is also
more reactive than gasoline, with typical octane ratings near 30.

PThese features make it more difficult to utilize in RCM experiments
since it can be challenging to prepare pre-vaporized fuel/oxidizer/
diluent mixtures due to the fuel's lower vapor pressure. Meanwhile,
jet fuels can more easily decompose/oxidize during the compression
stroke, before the desired test conditions are reached, and this is
especially true if the t50 of the machine is longer than 4 to 5 ms. As
such, the ‘compression’ limit identified in Fig. 28 is more easily
reached so leaner/more dilute mixtures, lower temperature and/or
lower pressures must be used to avoid this [31,160,161]. A summary
of studies performed on jet fuel and its surrogates is provided in
Table 9.

PThe autoignition characteristics of conventional and alternative
jet fuels, including Jet-A, JP-8, and S-8, were studied by Kumar and
Sung [461,462]. All the three jet fuels were observed to exhibit two-
stage ignition and NTC behavior. Comparison of tign showed that S-8
was the most reactive followed by JP-8 and Jet-A, respectively
[461,462]. Dooley et al. [463,464] studied the oxidation of Jet-A, as
well as a three- and a four-component surrogate, containing n-dec-
ane/isooctane/toluene and n-dodecane/isooctane/1,3,5-trimethyl-
benzene/n-propylbenzene, respectively, using various fundamental
devices. Both of the surrogates were shown to replicate well the tign
of the target Jet-A [463,464], but there were discrepancies associated
with the first-stage ignition characteristics. The four-component
blend better matched the molecular weight of the fuel-boiling range
fuel, and therefore transport-dominated phenomena like extinction
in diffusion flames were better reproduced by this surrogate blend.

PHui et al. [465] studied combustion characteristics of Jet-A and
six other alternative jet fuels in various fundamental combustion
systems. Laminar flame speeds, DCN values, and RCM ignition delay
times of the six alternative fuels were measured and compared in
this study. All the six alternative fuels exhibited two-stage ignition
behavior and the comparison of ignition delays showed Jet-A was
the least reactive of all the jet fuels tested.

PAllen et al. [160] studied the autoignition characteristics of stoi-
chiometric JP-8/air and camelina hydro-processed renewable jet
fuel (CHRJ)/air mixtures. They employed the direct test chamber
method, discussed in Section 2, for this work. Significant discrepan-
cies were observed when comparing t1 and tign of JP-8 with those
measured by Kumar and Sung [461] and issues of fuel vaporization
in the mixture preparation process were discussed as a possible
cause. Comparison of tign of JP-8 and CHRJ in Allen et al. [160]
showed that CHRJ was more reactive than JP-8, which is in accor-
dance with their derived cetane number (DCN) values. Allen et al.
[161] further conducted measurements of JP-8, CHRJ, and tallow
hydro-treated renewable jet fuel (THRJ)/air mixtures. Ignition delay
measurements of Allen et al. [161] showed CHRJ and THRJ were
more reactive than JP-8. CHRJ and THRJ exhibited identical tign at
fuel lean conditions while tign values of CHRJ were greater than
those of THRJ at stoichiometric conditions. Experimentally measured
tign results were also compared with those of surrogates from simu-
lations. Two surrogate mixtures were employed, including pure 2-
methylnonane and binary blend of n-dodecane and 2-methylunde-
cane for CHRJ and THRJ, respectively. It was found the efficacy of the

Psurrogates for emulating ignition propensity decreased with increas-
ing pressure. The two-component surrogate performed relatively
well for most of the conditions while the single-component surro-
gate of 2-methylnonane was superior at low pressures.

P6.7.3. Diesel and its surrogates

PDiesel contains hydrocarbons that typically range from C8 to C21,
and its molecular weight ranges from 170 to 230 g/mol. Diesel
engines generally operate using fuels rated with Cetane values of
40(cid:1)55. Like jet fuel, there are substantial challenges associated with
conducting experiments using diesel associated with volatility and
reactivity. Although there have been a considerable number of RCM
studies on large molecular weight hydrocarbons as discussed earlier,
there has only been one so far covering reference diesel fuels. Kukka-
dapu and Sung [466] performed an autoignition study of blends of
ultra-low sulfer diesel fuel (ULSD#2) and a FACE research diesel fuel
blend (FD9A) at pc of 10, 15, and 20 bar, covering Tc between 678 K
and 938 K, at varying ’ of 0.5, 0.69, and 1.02 for diesel/O2/N2 mix-
tures. The equivalence ratio was varied by changing the oxygen
mole percentage while keeping the fuel mole percentage fixed at
0.514%. The results demonstrated that diesel blends with similar
cetane ratings but different compositions can exhibit varying igni-
tion propensities across different temperature regimes. In particular,
differences were observed at temperatures where low temperature
branching reactions are important, as illustrated in Fig. 37. Further-
more, the RCM measurements were found to complement existing
shock tube data in the literature [467,468] and thus provided an
addition to the experimental database of diesel blends needed for
development and validation of diesel surrogate models.

P6.7.4. Summary - full-boiling range fuels

PThe collection of studies shows that the still imperfect state of
knowledge in kinetic modeling of individual hydrocarbons, added to
non-linear interaction effects between different components means
that the expected uncertainty in the predicted ignition delays of full
boiling fuels relatively to surrogate mixtures under autoignition con-
ditions is still no better than within a factor of two, particularly at
high pressures. Whereas there have been significant advances in
prediction of fuels that more closely resemble gasolines under
engine-like conditions, challenges remain when considering either
blends of heavier fuels, or with oxygenated compounds. These diffi-
culties, however, must be put into context of what is an acceptable
uncertainty when making predictions for engineering purposes,
either for engine design or gas turbine or safety considerations.

6.8. Fuel additives

PFuel additives are chemicals that can be used in very small quan-
tities to significantly modify the ignition propensity and/or combus-
tion behavior of a fuel. These are typically distinguished from
blended fuel components, e.g., butane, and are generally added at
volume fractions near 1% or less, though they sometimes can be
present in larger amounts. Fuel additives have historically been

Pclassified as knock inhibitors
(anti-knock agents) or cetane
improvers, and while they have been explored primarily for conven-
tional SI and CI combustion systems, there are numerous potential
applications within LTC schemes [22]. These chemicals however, can
be difficult to utilize in RCM tests. Conventional anti-knock agents
like organometallics (e.g., tetraethyl lead), in addition to being toxic,
have a tendency to form metal oxides on the surfaces of the reaction
chamber, leading to contamination that is difficult to remove. Cetane
improvers, on the other hand, due to their high reactivity, even
at pre-test conditions, can lead to pre-ignition events in the fuel/
oxidizer mixing tank. Some fuel additives can also coat surfaces of
the mixing tank and foul feed lines to the reaction chamber, subse-
quently perturbing non-additized tests. A summary of studies per-
formed on fuel additives is provided in Table 10.

P6.8.1. Anti-knock agents

PJost and R€ogener [64] investigated the influence of various anti-
knock agents including aniline, iron pentacarbonyl, and TEL doped
into n-heptane at various levels from 1 to 4% volume basis, using
selected test conditions. The compression ratio was adjusted to vary
Tc, and pc shifted accordingly. The tign data indicated that the effec-
tiveness of the dopants could be ranked as aniline > iron pentacar-
bonyl > TEL. However, this is contrary to their respective octane
boosting effectiveness [471]. Furthermore, under some conditions,
TEL seemed to enhance the low temperature reactivity of the fuel/
air mixtures, resulting in shorter tign.

PR€ogener [65] followed this work with measurements using a
blend of TEL/n-heptane doped at 1.5% mole fraction, covering a
similar range of compressed temperatures and pressures, but also
exploring fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures, in addition to the stoi-
chiometric ones. Comparisons with undoped fuel tests indicated
that for all of the conditions explored, t1 was not noticeably
affected by the presence of TEL. However, tign was significantly
lengthened. Additionally, whereas the undoped fuel exhibited an
inverse dependency of (tign (cid:1) t1) on the compressed pressure, the
doped blend did not, so an increase in pc did not result in a

Pcorresponding decrease in (tign (cid:1) t1). The data for the doped blend
therefore exhibited NTC behavior, while this was absent with the
undoped fuel. This transition to NTC behavior with TEL addition
can be seen in Fig. 10c of Section 2.

PJovellanos et al. [469] studied the effect of TEL addition to
isooctane where changes in ignition delays and critical explosion
pressures, defined as the maximum pressure observed due to pre-
liminary heat release before autoignition, were recorded. The TEL
used in this work was a commercial blend that included 1,2-
dichloro- and 1,2-dibromo-ethane, which act as lead scavengers to
prevent surface contamination in operating engines. The preliminary
heat release measured in these tests, as documented in later work
[69], was due to mild ignition, or flame propagation within their
reaction chamber. This is discussed more shortly. The critical explo-
sion pressure was chosen as an indicator of the extent of mass
burned before transitioning to end gas autoignition, and thus knock.
A fuel with higher critical explosion pressure therefore was expected
to exhibit higher anti-knocking tendency. To understand the effect of
TEL, the authors utilized various fuel/air ratios and different doping
levels, where a range of compressed pressures and temperatures
were covered via adjustments to CR. The initial temperature and
pressure were held constant so Tc and pc changed simultaneously,
while doping levels were 0(cid:1)1230 ppm. In their analysis, there was
no attempt to account for the shifts in compressed conditions due to
changes in the mixture heat capacities. The experimental measure-
ments indicated that over the full range of conditions investigated,
the addition of TEL leads to increases in the critical explosion pres-
sure; however, over the range of ’ D 0.9(cid:1)1.35, the addition of TEL
results in no discernable effect on tign.

PTaylor et al. [69] followed this work by studying the influence of
TEL on a number of other fuels, including n-butane, n-heptane, iso-
octane, and benzene, using doping levels of 0(cid:1)800 ppm. The TEL
used for these tests was not blended with any lead scavengers. In
addition to measurements of tign, the authors also reported differen-
ces in the rates of pressure rise during ignition, as well as combus-
tion progress via high speed photography through the end wall. The

Poptical measurements were not recorded simultaneously with
the pressure-time histories due to experimental complications,
while changes to t1 were not documented in detail for these tests.
The authors noted for most of the experiments the chemilumines-
cence exhibited characteristics of either spotty ignition, with exo-
thermic centers sporadically located throughout
the reaction
chamber, or where distinct flame front(s) formed and propagated
across the reaction chamber. Often the mixtures transitioned to vol-
umetric autoignition. For only a few tests, the chemiluminescence
was observed to be uniformly distributed at ignition. Taylor et al.
[69] did not find any discernable effect of TEL on benzene. However,
the n-heptane/TEL blends at stoichiometric conditions exhibited
increased reactivity at temperatures below 720 K, while at tempera-
tures above this tign was noticeably lengthened. Furthermore, at
Tc D 820 K, the TEL more significantly extended tign for the leaner
mixtures. The isooctane/TEL blends, on the other hand, as noted by
Jovellanos et al. [469], did not experience any substantial changes to
tign, although the progress of ignition was significantly altered. For
instance, it was found that TEL reduced the rates of pressure rise,
and thus the violence of explosion by causing the mixture to burn
more slowly. The high speed photography data at Tc D 660 K, pc D 20
bar, and ’ D 1 revealed that the inflammation process occurred more
slowly because a well-defined flame front was established, whereas
without TEL there was no flame front. At Tc D 838 K, pc D 19 bar, TEL
did not appear to influence the general appearance or reaction rate
in the flame photographs, even though the pressure rise rates were
still reduced.

PInteractions between TEL and autoigniting mixtures are complex,
as demonstrated by the previous RCM studies. At the lowest temper-
atures, the release of ethyl radicals from the additive can stimulate
reactivity resulting in shortened ignition delays. Complete dissocia-
tion of TEL is endothermic and requires elevated temperatures how-
ever. Fuels with substantial LTHR can enhance this process, so that
the time difference between t1 and tign is increased [65]. After disso-
ciation, Pb radicals act as a significant radical scavenger and thus
reduce overall reactivity, while the formation of lead oxide (PbO)
precipant leads to a catalytic sink for formaldehyde and other impor-
tant radicals [472]. Flames that pass through the PbO fog are
significantly slowed, as observed in [69]. While TEL has been demon-
strated to be an excellent knock inhibitor, lead unfortunately poisons
catalytic converters by chemically bonding to active surface sites of
the catalyst and forming lead alloys. This reduces catalyst perfor-
mance by decreasing the fraction of surface area available to promote
CO and UHC oxidation, while it increases the distance through which
the reactant molecules must diffuse within the pore structure before
undergoing reaction. Disposal of lead contaminated catalysts can be
environmentally problematic and very costly.

PMohamed [273] investigated the effects of diethylamine (DEA)
(doped at »5% mol) on stoichiometric n-pentane and n-heptane
mixtures in synthetic air. Pressure-time data and total light output
data (via a photomultiplier) were recorded. It was found that DEA
extended the first-stage of the two-stage ignition of n-pentane and
n-heptane, leading to a decrease in both the pressure rise and the
light intensity associated with the LTHR process. This behavior is dif-
ferent than that observed in [473] with TEL. Moreover, a longer
second-stage ignition delay time was measured. Consequently, an
increase in tign was observed for n-heptane throughout the tempera-
ture range of 650(cid:1)950 K, where first-stage reactions persisted to
temperatures above 850 K. The tign of n-pentane was increased in
the range 650(cid:1)850 K by the addition of DEA, but was decreased at
compressed gas temperatures greater than 850 K. It was suggested
that the inhibiting role of DEA might be derived from its radical
_
scavenging interactions via

_
abstraction of DEA via H
O2, and subsequent decomposition of H2O2
_
OH radicals. These features were not explored or confirmed
into two
via chemical kinetic modeling, however.

PInvestigations with anti-knock agents have provided useful
insight into the evolution of, and perturbations to end gas auto-
ignition chemistry for various fuels, and how these influence
knock development. It can be difficult to extend the observed
shifts in tign at selected conditions to the performance of fuel
additives in operating engines. As discussed in Section 5, knock
ensues from highly coupled chemical-physical phenomena, of
which autoignition chemistry is one component. Evaporative
cooling, turbulent flame propagation, and pressure wave (cid:1) wall
interactions are also critically important. Some additives are only
influential within the high temperature flame zone of the com-
bustion chamber by altering propagation velocities, e.g., via par-
ticle condensation/growth and subsequent catalytic activity
[474(cid:1)476]. The work of Taylor et al. [69] illustrated how TEL can
affect flame propagation processes. Nevertheless, opportunities
exist to utilize RCM platforms to understand the perturbative
effects of emerging, non-toxic (e.g., bio-derived) fuel additives
under conditions relevant to modern, boosted SI engines [477],
as well as LTC regimes.

P6.8.2. Cetane improvers

PIn their study of anti-knock agents, Jost and R€ogener [64] also
investigated the influence of various cetane improvers including
amyl nitrite, ethyl nitrate, and acetone peroxide doped into n-
heptane at »5%, at 675 K and 16.5 bar The mixtures for these were at
stoichiometric ratios with air dilution levels. The limited tign data
indicated the effectiveness of the dopants could be ranked as ethyl
nitrate > acetone peroxide > amyl nitrite.

PJovellanos et al. [469] also studied the effect of ethyl nitrite on
the autoignition of 2,2,3 trimethyl butane, commonly referred as
triptane. Triptane is a highly branched hydrocarbon and exhibits
high anti-knocking tendency with an octane rating of RON/MON
D 112/101. Tests used a fixed compression ratio of 11.7 at stoi-
chiometric conditions where doping covered 0(cid:1)13%, liquid vol-
ume basis. This study showed the doping effectiveness of ethyl
nitrite was somewhat nonlinear where, in particular, no noticeable
change in tign was observed when the doping level was less than
0.2% by volume, while doping levels higher than this decreased
tign monotonically.
In addition, the critical explosion pressures
decreased monotonically with ethyl nitrite doping. At the highest
doping level, the authors found the fuel behaved analogously to
isooctane.

PInomata et al. [470] studied the effect of doping n-butane with
ethanal, diethyl ether, isopropyl nitrate, and DTBP in small amounts
(<5% by volume). Comparison of tign showed ethanal and diethyl
ether had a weak effect on reactivity, while addition of isopropyl
nitrate and DTBP had strong effects, where DTBP was found to be
more stimulating than isopropyl nitrate. Furthermore, the change in
reactivity due to the additives was dependent on the compressed
temperature. For temperatures in the NTC regime, between 765 K
and 785 K, it was observed that the additives did not affect the reac-
tivity until a critical doping level was reached, and beyond this value
the reactivity increased nonlinearly. For temperatures greater than
the NTC peak, in the range of 825(cid:1)880 K, a threshold doping level
was not observed and the reactivity increased with increasing vol-
ume percentage of the additive. Based on the experimental results,
the authors hypothesized the effectiveness of fuel additives on
cetane number enhancement is dependent on three main criteria:
(1) exothermic decomposition of the additive, (2) provision of multi-
ple free radicals upon decomposition, and (3) supplementary reac-
tivity induced through the molecular products as a result of the
oxidation of additives.

PGriffiths et al. [267] studied the decomposition of DTBP with and
without oxygen. The authors found the decomposition of DTBP
under pyrolysis conditions is greatly enhanced at higher tempera-
tures, while oxidation of DTBP for the conditions investigated pro-
ceeded through two-stage ignition. Second-stage ignition was
observed when the concentration levels of oxygen exceeded an
equi-molar proportion with DTBP. Dp1 was found to be less depen-
dent on oxygen when the oxygen concentrations were higher than
equi-molar proportion with DTBP.

PTanaka et al. [395] studied the effect of DTBP and 2-ethylhexyl
nitrate (2-EHN) addition to PRF90 and PRF100 (i.e., isooctane), doped
at 0(cid:1)2% liquid volume basis (0(cid:1)1.8% molar basis). Comparison of
tign showed DTBP had a higher ignition accelerating effect than
2-EHN. This finding however, is contrary to recent DCN tests and
accompanying HCCI engine studies conducted under fairly similar
conditions, albeit at lower doping levels [478]. The DTBP and 2-EHN
additives were observed to decrease t1 and tign, and the pressure
rise due to first-stage ignition increased when the mixtures were
doped using either additive. The authors illustrated that the shift in
Dp1 also correlated with the shorter tign, and this trend was similar
with the undoped fuel measurements. Both DTBP and 2-EHN dissoci-
ate quickly at elevated temperatures and produce alkoxyl radicals.
The highly reactive alkoxyl radicals abstract H-atoms from fuel mol-
ecules, thereby initiating the low-temperature branching chain.
DTBP produces two alkoxyl radicals upon dissociation, while 2-EHN
produces only one alkoxyl radical. Therefore, for the two additives
tested in this study, it was explained that DTBP had a higher ignition
accelerating effect.

PGoldsborough et al. [134] studied the effect of 2-EHN addition to
two gasoline surrogate fuels. Both surrogates were blended to have
an anti-knock index, i.e., (RON + MON)/2, of 91. The first was PRF91,
and the second a TRF blend containing 20% toluene, 12.8% n-heptane,
and 67.2% isooctane on a liquid volume basis. The predicted TRF91
octane rating was based on the work of Morgan et al. [405]. Doping
levels of 0(cid:1)3% liquid volume basis (0(cid:1)2.7% molar basis) were used.
The measurements indicated the reactivity of both surrogates
increased upon addition of 2-EHN and both surrogates exhibited
similar response upon addition of the dopant. However, it was
shown that 2-EHN was more effective at low temperatures in TRF91,
while in the intermediate temperature range 2-EHN was more effec-
tive in PRF91. Although the detailed chemical kinetic model used to
complement the measurements was found to replicate the experi-
mental trends observed, the magnitude of accelerative effect of the
additive on ignition was significantly over-predicted, and this sug-
gested deficiencies in the base gasoline surrogate model. Neverthe-
less, the simulations indicated that CH2O and CH3O2 chemistry are
very sensitive to the presence of 2-EHN, while dopant-derived 3-
heptyl radicals were predicted to play an important role in stimulat-
ing autoignition. Furthermore, nitrogen chemistry was found to be
important through the NO(cid:1)NO2 loop (see Section 6.2.4), which can
_
OH. At the highest doping levels,
generate substantial amounts of
the formation of methyl and ethyl nitrite, and nitric acid competes
_
with this loop so less
OH is generated, constraining the reactivity
enhancement of 2-EHN.

PRCM studies investigating cetane improvers have suggested var-
ious chemical kinetic processes by which fuel autoignition can be
stimulated due to the presence of additive decomposition products,
which include different types of radicals. While there is potential to
further investigate cetane improvers as they might be applied
in LTC engine schemes such as reactivity controlled compression
ignition [22], these studies have also highlighted opportunities
whereby conventional cetane improvers, or other radical precur-
sors, e.g., tert-butylhydroperoxide, could be used at very small con-
centrations to perturb the LTC pathways described in Fig. 37 in
order to better understand and more rigorously quantify fuel auto-
ignition chemistry. While this is sometimes undertaken in flow

Preactor and shock tube studies [479,480], it has not been pursued
within RCM platforms.

7. Summary and outlook

PFuture internal combustion and gas turbine engines will face
increasingly stringent fuel economy, performance and emissions
requirements. To meet these, next-generation devices are expected
to utilize a range of low temperature combustion approaches as dis-
cussed in Section 1. The design of such engines requires significantly
improved fundamental understandings of low- and intermediate-
temperature autoignition phenomena, along with the development
of robust combustion models that can reliably predict these pro-
cesses. Additionally, as new fuels, including those which are more
carbon-neutral, are integrated into the market, it will be necessary
to quantify how their combustion behavior is different from conven-
tional fuels so flexible engine operating schemes can be devised for
optimal performance.

PThis review extends significantly beyond recent works [63, 39],
and highlights the pivotal role RCM studies have played in under-
standing LTC/DLE phenomena,
including demonstrating novel
experimental approaches and advanced diagnostics which have
been employed as key tools towards improving our fundamental
understanding of, and capability to model relevant chemistry and
physics. The excellent diagnostic access and the ability to maintain
prescribed test conditions for relatively long periods of time have
enabled RCM studies to investigate autoignition processes at the
highest densities (e.g., lower temperatures and higher pressures)
and fuel loading conditions of any experimental methods.

PThe range of operation for RCMs overlaps that of shock tubes in
the high pressure (10(cid:1)60 bar),
intermediate temperature range
around 1000 K, and autoignition information from such devices are
typically in good agreement, once appropriate corrections for facility
effects are taken into account. The increasing understanding of fluid
and gas dynamic processes, which can limit the capabilities of both
devices, has greatly improved the agreement between experimental
data and model predictions, where these must take into account not
only the compressed conditions, but the evolution of boundary
layers and other physical phenomena that can be influential during
a particular test. Advances in instrumentation and understanding of
various physical processes, such as properly suppressing vortex roll-
up, has also led to much better consistency between RCM datasets.
For example, studies of isooctane autoignition can now be shown to
agree to within a factor of 1.6 (interdecile range) across a variety of
different machines [62], where the origin of variations in individual
measurements can be traced to the very high dependence of autoig-
nition chemistry on gas temperature history and its spatial distribu-
tion. The gas compression trajectory and piston crevice design are
accordingly very influential facility parameters [481].

PThe importance of temperature specification has motivated
recent efforts to rigorously quantify experimental uncertainties
associated with the evaluation of this parameter [482], and these
analyses should be extended to account for, not only random mea-
surement errors, but also systematic errors associated with experi-
mental configurations and operating protocol, e.g.,
[483,484].
Related to this, as discussed in Section 4, recent efforts have been
undertaken to quantify the extent of uncertainties associated with
various approaches used to model the experiments, and the level of
detail necessary to minimize these for various reacting systems,
though open questions still remain. Some mixtures and state condi-
tions are more sensitive to facility effects, while other reacting sys-
tems are less so. To date there are no definitive metrics or rigorous
guidelines that can be used across a wide range of conditions
towards evaluating chemical kinetic models, or comparing datasets
between different RCM facilities, and other experimental appara-
tuses. Theory on ignition phenomena have started to address these

Pissues, as seen by recent advances in defining ignition regimes in
terms of dimensionless parameters (presented in Section 4). This
remains a serious need for the entire combustion community.

PSignificant progress has been made towards generating consen-
sus for ‘best practices’ towards machine design and operation, some
of which were discussed in [39], with additional detail presented in
Section 2. Many of these ‘best practices’ have now become the norm
across many devices, while designers of new components and devi-
ces are encouraged to leverage past advances, and to publish
detailed descriptions and characterization work that demonstrate
new capabilities, or limitations of concepts. It is beneficial to apply
high-fidelity and/or reduced-order models before prototyping new
concepts. A limitation remains however, how to archive and report
RCM data which transparently describes the evolution of the state
conditions from start of compression to the time of autoignition,
particularly for researchers not familiar with RCM experiments. Data
conditioning, for instance, can affect the measured pressures and
thus computed temperatures, when derived from pressure data. It is
stressed that uncertainty analyses should include the effects of dif-
ferent methods of conditioning data, as well as different means to
define end-of-compression. The International RCM Workshop Char-
acterization Initiative has made progress towards this [62], but it is
still an area of need, and potential for considerable contribution to
the RCM and combustion communities.

PMechanistic information about chemical pathways has tradition-
ally emerged from continuous sampling of flow/jet reactors, often
though, under thermodynamic or fuel loading conditions far from
those experienced in operating engines. Recent advances in quench-
ing and sampling from RCMs, followed by gas composition analysis
has facilitated high impact studies allowing experimental interro-
gation of chemical intermediates at high pressures where there are
few data to develop theory and benchmark chemistry. Understand-
ing of the behavior of autoignition chemistry for branched and
unbranched hydrocarbons across low- and intermediate-tempera-
tures has been derived, in part, from careful RCM sampling work,
combined with mechanistic information from other studies. There is
a need to extend the current database with increasing use of time-
resolved diagnostics, some of which are highlighted in Section 3.
Speciation via gas sample analysis along with additional absorption
and LIF diagnostics will increase both the extent of mechanistic
information for a range of fuels, as well as provide additional con-
straints on absolute and relative reaction rates [500], which are criti-
cal for the construction and confident use of rate rules [372,485],
and for converging on unique solutions to represent combustion
chemistry. Challenges of adequately closing the carbon, or atom bal-
ance for tests with large molecular weight species can be mitigated
by, for example, coupling the sampling and analytical units with
heated glass-lined tubing [486]. The use of time-resolved absorption
diagnostics
evolving quickly
[487(cid:1)490,491], and while currently limited, could add further to the
arsenal of diagnostics providing mechanistic information, particu-
larly as longer and shorter wavelength sources become more acces-
sible and reliable. Additionally, approaches which could exploit the
isomeric selectivity and radical detection capabilities of synchro-
tron-based, molecular beam mass spectroscopy techniques, as has
been recently implemented with novel shock tube configurations
[45], could yield extremely valuable information at LTC conditions.
Implementation of advanced and emerging diagnostics will need to
consider and mitigate issues associated with non-idealities such as
boundary layer development, etc. at longer test times.

PHigh speed, spatially-resolved imaging diagnostics have pro-
vided a wealth of information on the effects of thermal stratifica-
tion and charge motion governing, for instance, the onset of mild
ignition as well as other physical-chemical interactions, as dis-
cussed in Section 5. These phenomena are significantly more com-
plex than pure chemical kinetic processes, yet are central to the

Poverall understanding of how autoignition takes place in practical
devices. Significantly more work needs to be done with the help of
advanced (kHz-range) diagnostics [492,493], as well as DNS and
LES simulations, in order to come to a clearer picture of the devel-
opment of non-uniformities, and the interplay between transport
and chemistry on the overall heat release rate in autoigniting mix-
tures. New and evolving techniques such as schlieren image (parti-
cle-free) velocimetry [494] and plentopic imaging [495,496] have
potential to provide additional
insight into these phenomena.
Application of such high speed, spatially-resolved diagnostics could
also help elucidate complex processes associated with emerging
LTC approaches such as plasma-assisted autoignition [191(cid:1)193].

PA growing set of fuels has been considered covering a range of
conditions in RCMs, yet there are still a number of quantitative
gaps, particularly at extreme densities (lower temperatures and
higher pressures (upwards of 100+ bar)) where it is difficult for
RCMs and shock tubes to maintain high quality experimental condi-
tions, and where diagnostics, even accurate/robust pressure trans-
ducers, are limited. Additionally, there is a lack of sufficiently
reliable information concerning real fuels, including natural gas
blends and full-boiling range fuels. The relatively lower reactivity
of natural gas components, which are currently very relevant for
use in industrial and large engines, means that the high pressures
and/or temperatures required for autoignition are often beyond the
capabilities of many existing devices. Furthermore, only recently
have well-characterized, research grade, full-boiling range trans-
portation fuels been formulated for standardized testing [460].
Challenges associated with the involatility of jet fuels and diesels,
as well as some oxygenates, are difficult to overcome, though new
experimental approaches as described in Section 2, hold promise
for conducting tests over a range of conditions. There is a relative
dearth of data for the many non-conventional fuels currently being
considered for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, where unique
functional groups or moieties within the molecular structures can
significantly affect combustion behavior.

PThe mechanisms of alkane autoignition are fairly well under-
stood, though a variety of quantitative gaps for specific com-
pounds still exist.
In addition, new data has indicated the
existence unique kinetic pathways not previously considered, such
_
as the addition of a third O2 to alternatively isomerized
OOQOOH
_
P(OOH)2), where this could compete with (R6a) in
species (i.e.,
Fig. 37, offering an additional route to chain branching [497,498].
The situation is not nearly as clear for alkenes, cyclic and aromatic
hydrocarbons, for which both mechanistic and rate information
are lacking. For instance, predictions of preliminary exothermic
temperature rise can be off by an order of magnitude, especially
at high concentrations. Furthermore, highly non-linear synergistic
and antagonistic effects that arise from fuel blending, particularly
observed with compounds of very different reactivity, pose a sig-
nificant challenge to predictive models, where data from different
devices/regimes can indicate different interactive behavior, such as
the potential for cross reactions. These complications are responsi-
ble for many of the difficulties in achieving closure between
multi-component surrogate blends and practical, full-boiling range
fuels [499]. There is also a need for more studies covering the
influences of real EGR (including minor constituents) and fuel
additives on LTC processes. While major combustion products
such as CO2 and H2O have been studied, there are very limited
data for pollutants such as NOx and UHCs, which can have signifi-
cantly greater perturbing characteristics. Opportunities to use fuel
additives as radical precursors to more facilely quantify autoigni-
tion chemistry are highlighted in Section 6. Finally, uncertainties
in chemical models are not well quantified, nor consistently
reported [286,383], but these must be addressed in order to rigor-
ously validate model results, and more effectively design new
RCM experiments that can constrain simulation predictions. These
