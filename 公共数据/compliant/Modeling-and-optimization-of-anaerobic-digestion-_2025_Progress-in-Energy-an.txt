Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an important technology that can be engaged to produce renewable energy and
valuable products from organic waste while reducing the net greenhouse gas emissions. Due to the AD process
complexity, further development of AD technology goes hand in hand with the advancement of underlying
mathematical models and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive and critical review of
current AD process modeling and optimization techniques as well as various aspects of further processing of AD
products. The most important mechanistically inspired, kinetic, and phenomenological AD models and the most
frequently used deterministic and stochastic methods for AD process optimization are addressed. The founda-
tions, properties, and features of these models and methods are highlighted, discussed, and compared with
respect to advantages, disadvantages, and various performance metrics; the models are also ranked with respect
to adequately introduced criteria. Since AD process optimization affects heavily the required treatment and
utilization of AD products, biogas and digestate utilization in the production of renewable energy and other
valuable products is also addressed. Furthermore, special attention is devoted to the challenges and future
research needs related to AD modeling and optimization, such are modeling issues related to foaming and mi-
crobial activities, AD model parameters calibration, CFD simulation challenges, availability of experimental data,
and optimization of the AD process with respect to further biogas and digestate utilizations. As current research
results indicate, further progress in these areas could notably improve AD modeling robustness and accuracy as
well as AD optimization performance.

1. Introduction

Global energy consumption has increased dramatically in recent
years and this trend is projected to continue. In 2022, the energy con-
sumption worldwide was around 604 EJ, of which the renewable energy
consumption represented less than 7.5 % [1]. According to some esti-
mates, by 2050 the total energy consumption will rise to 760 EJ with the
share of renewable energy expected to be around 32 % [1]. The most
important sources of renewable energy are solar, hydro, wind,
geothermal, ocean, hydrogen, biomass, and various wastes. By con-
verting waste into energy, the amount of waste entering landfills and
consequently greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduce substantially. The
most common technologies for waste to energy conversion are inciner-
ation,
thermal
de-polymerization, hydrothermal carbonization, and anaerobic diges-
tion (AD) [2]. Among these, AD technology used in biogas plants (Fig. 1)
has attracted remarkable attention within the scientific community
because it provides valuable environmental, economic, social, health,
and energy benefits.

For example, AD technology has a potential to: (i) reduce current

global GHG emissions approximately by 10–13 % [3], (ii) reduce
organic waste deposition at landfills and decrease odor [4], (iii) reduce
environmental pollution by heavy metals (heavy metals recovery from
digestate) [5], (iv) produce biofertilizers (nutrients N, P, and K recovery
from liquid and solid digestate or direct use of the digestate as fertilizer)
[6,7], (v) deliver liquid digestate for algae growth [8], and (vi) produce
clean energy (the produced biogas delivered 1.61 EJ in 2022 and this
figure is expected to increase up to 15 EJ in 2050) [1]. Once the pro-
duced biogas meets the corresponding quality requirements, it can be
used for production of heat, steam, electricity, and other valuable
products [9,10]. Furthermore, a desulfurized and purified biogas can be
used as alternative fuel for internal combustion engines, such are gas
engines and dual-fuel diesel engines [11]. Biogas purification delivers
CO2 as a byproduct, which can be used for various purposes, including
production of e-fuels and chemicals (methanol, methane, carbon mon-
oxide ...). Due to the mentioned benefits, it is no doubt that the AD
technology plays an important role in the scope of waste management,
environmental issues, and renewable energy production. Consequently,
considerable attention is nowadays focused on AD technology devel-
opment and implementation.

Till today, various AD technologies and their implementations have

been investigated in order to maximize the process efficiency. These
technologies are mostly related to feedstock, bioreactor type and
configuration, feeding strategy, and operating conditions.

Regarding feedstock, one usually distinguishes between using only a
single type of organic waste (mono AD) and several various types of
waste (AcoD). In the latter case, some feedstock-related limitations,
which may be encountered in mono AD, can be overcome or mitigated to
a reasonable degree [6]. In any case, the usability of some feedstock
types and AD performance can be improved by appropriate waste pre-
treatments [12], recirculation of liquid digestate after appropriate
treatments [13], as well as by biological and inorganic additives [14,
15]. With respect to the content of the total solids (TS) in the feedstock,
bioreactor capacity as well as energy needed for heating and stirring
have to be considered [16]. The TS consist mostly of particulate organic
matter (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, inert matter) and microbes [17,
18]. An AD process with more than 15 % of TS (solid AD) in the
bioreactor requires smaller bioreactor capacity, larger amounts of added
microbes, and less energy for heating and stirring, when compared to
liquid AD (less than 15 % of TS in the bioreactor) [16].

Related to bioreactor type, in general, the horizontal type behaves
well with respect to hydraulic retention time (HRT) of organic matter
(OM); the vertical type offers higher organic loading rates (OLR), while
the inclined type is likely to deliver optimal biogas yield [16]. All these
types can be used either as one-stage AD by performing all AD process
steps in one bioreactor, or can be configured for two- or three-stage AD

by physical separation of the digestion steps into two or three bio-
reactors [17].

Concerning the feeding strategy,

there are continuous, semi-
continuous, and batch operating modes. In continuous mode, the feed-
stock continuously flows into the bioreactor and the AD products flow
out of the bioreactor; this results in a steady-state process with practi-
cally constant conditions for microbial growth. In batch mode, the
feedstock is fed only once, resulting in time-depended substrate degra-
dation and biogas production as well as in variable conditions for mi-
crobial growth [16].

C), mesophilic (25 (cid:0) 40

With respect to operating conditions, temperature and pH value are
probably the most exposed parameters. An AD process can be performed
at psychrophilic (10 (cid:0) 25
C) or thermophilic
(40 (cid:0) 65
C) conditions. On the other hand, the pH value should usually
be somewhere within the interval of (5.5 (cid:0) 8.5) [19,20]. Finally, the
mixing strategy is also an important factor. Currently, the following
options are the most exposed: (i) impeller mixing by rotating various
types of impellers being submerged in the slurry; (ii) slurry recirculation
by the diffusion of the slurry through nozzles, previously pumped from
the center of the bioreactor; and (iii) gas sparging by compressed biogas
being forced through the entire bioreactor volume [21]. It has to be
noted that some of the mentioned AD technologies have already been
applied successfully in full-scale biogas plants and are fully commer-
cialized, while some of them are still being evaluated at lab-scale or
pilot-scale implementations.

Till

In general, experiment-based investigations and improvements of
various AD-related technologies are time consuming, labor intensive,
and expensive. Consequently, it is worth working on the development of
numerical simulation (NS) and numerical optimization of the AD pro-
cess. As these two procedures improve with time, one can expect to get
ever better understanding of the processes involved and ever more
refined technological solutions implementable in actual biogas plants.
today, various more or less sophisticated mechanistically
inspired, kinetic, and phenomenological AD models have been devel-
oped and some excellent reviews have already been done. In Ref. [22]
the emphasis is on mechanistically inspired ADM1-based AD models
developed up to the year 2012; phenomenological models are addressed
very briefly, while kinetic models as well as topics related to AD process
optimization are not addressed at all. In Ref. [16] the focus is on the
modeling of solid-state AD, where the contribution of mass transfer
phenomena becomes significant; some kinetic and phenomenological
models developed up to the year 2015 are also addressed, while AD
process optimization is not considered. In Ref. [23] the focus is on a few
kinetic and phenomenological AD models while ADM1-based modeling
and AD process optimization are addressed in a relatively modest extent.
A very nice presentation of kinetic and mechanistically inspired AD
models is offered in Ref. [24]; the phenomenological models as well as
AD process optimization topics, however, are not addressed. Regarding
AD process optimization, some limited reviews are available, which
focus primarily on stochastic optimization methods and typically refer
to a rather limited pool of involved AD models [23,25,26].

Although all these reviews offer an excellent insight into the topics
being considered within their respective primary focus, one can argue
that there are still some open issues or gaps which are surely of signif-
icant interest. In this context, probably the most valuable contributions
would be achieved by providing in one place the following: (i) a
comprehensive review and comparison of all types of AD models, from
a
mechanistically

phenomenological

inspired

ones;

(ii)

to

comprehensive review and evaluation of all types of optimization
methods engaged in AD optimization; (iii) a review of AD products’
requirements and their implications for the formulation and execution of
advanced optimization models which would include these requirements;
and (iv) a comprehensive and structured identification of all possible
challenges, ranging from availability of experimental data, over micro-
bial community considerations and phenomena like foaming, to nu-
merical issues like AD model calibration or stiffness of the involved
equations.

This work offers a good insight into the state-of-the-art of modeling
and optimization of the AD process in biogas plants. The main novelties
are related to: (i) structured presentation, characterization, and evalu-
ation of
the most efficient mechanistically inspired, kinetic, and
phenomenological AD models; (ii) clear presentation, characterization,
and evaluation of the most commonly used deterministic and stochastic
methods for AD optimization; (iii) revealing and exposing the most
important requirements for AD products with respect to their utiliza-
tions as well as biogas and digestate upgrading technologies, (iv) iden-
tification and structured presentation of current challenges related to
the availability of AD process experimental data, advanced AD
modeling, balance between simplicity and complexity of AD models,
stability and efficiency of AD simulations, and optimization of the AD
process. Section 2 contains a short description of AD-related biochem-
ical, chemical, and physicochemical processes as well as AD key pa-
rameters. The mechanistically inspired, kinetic, and phenomenological
AD models are presented in Section 3. The most significant AD models
are highlighted and compared, and their effectiveness is critically dis-
cussed. The most frequently referred implementations of AD models are
ranked by adequately introduced criteria. These criteria are based on a
complexity factor for mechanistically inspired AD models, an accuracy
factor for the kinetic models, and an overall accuracy factor for
phenomenological models. Furthermore, the AD models are discussed
with respect to their advantages, disadvantages, and five performance

evaluation metrics. In Section 4, the AD optimization procedures,
derived by combining various optimization methods with various AD
models, are presented, discussed, and evaluated with respect to their
advantages and disadvantages. The optimization methods most
frequently used in AD optimization are presented and evaluated in
relation to their efficiency and stability. Section 5 deals with biogas and
digestate treatments and their advanced utilizations. In Section 6
attention is focused on the challenges related to AD process modeling
and optimization in the context of ensuring high quality of AD products,
allowing for their further environmentally friendly processing and
usage. Finally, some future research needs are proposed.

2. AD technology

Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an extremely complex process, involving
biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical reactions. It is therefore of
utmost importance to identify and review briefly the key processes and
their most influential parameters.

2.1. AD process

In a bioreactor, AD transforms OM from complex substrate (T-CS) by
various biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical conversion pro-
cesses and various intermediates into biogas, liquid digestate, and solid
digestate [15,18,20,27–30]. These conversion processes are schemati-
cally presented in Fig. 2.

The biochemical processes in the liquid phase are related to various
bio-metabolism steps,
including disintegration, hydrolysis, acido-
genesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis, which are driven by the
concerted, sequential, and cooperative activities of various microbial
communities in the absence of oxygen [15–20,31]. A well-balanced
microbial consortium, which is crucial for efficient biogas production,
depends on the type and quantity of microbes [32]. For this reason, some
biological additives can be introduced directly into the bioreactor. Such
inoculation with biological additives can improve AD performance by:
(i) increasing the microbial diversity towards a better hydrolytic or
methanogenic activity (bioaugmentation); and (ii) providing enzymes to
facilitate hydrolysis of biodegradable macro components [14]. The
chemical processes in a bioreactor are related mostly to the liquid-liquid
processes, such are dissociation-association processes, complexation
processes by adding the synthetic chelating agents, adsorption, and
redox reactions [15,18,20,29,30,33]. The physicochemical processes in
a bioreactor are related mostly to the liquid-solid processes, such are
precipitation-dissolution processes, and to the liquid-gas mass transfer
processes [27]. Most of the mentioned biochemical, chemical, and
physicochemical processes can be positively influenced by various
inorganic (minerals, metals, ...) and organic (biochar, activated carbon,
...) additives.
Inorganic additives can significantly improve the
decomposition and biodegradation of organic pollutants, the stability of
the AD system, and further lead to improved production of CH4 [34]. On
the other hand, biochar, which contains important minerals, plays a
crucial role in microbial community and CH4 production [35].

The biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical processes involved
in AD take place on various time scales. In general, the chemical pro-
cesses are faster than the physicochemical and biochemical processes,
with the dissociation-association being the fastest one [29,36]. Physi-
cochemical
or
precipitation-dissolution, take place at a much lower rate [27], while the
slowest ones are the biochemical processes [29,36].

During the disintegration step of the AD process, the OM is degraded
to biodegradable macro components (solid substrate particulates) of:
carbohydrates
collagen
proteins,
n; and lipids (C57H104O6) [15,18,20]. Further
(CH1.93N0.3O0.55S0.006)
degradation of biodegradable macro components into monomers (sol-
uble components) is taking place during the hydrolysis step: carbohy-
drates to sugar (C6H12O6); proteins to gelatin (CH2.03O0.6N0.3S0.006),
consisting of
taurine, hydroxyproline,
aspartic acid, threonine, serine, glutamic acid, proline, lanthionine,
leucine,
glycine, alanine, cysteine, valine, methionine,
tyrosine, phenylalanine, hydroxylysine, histidine, ornithine,
lysine,
arginine, and tryptophan [20]; and lipids to glycerol (C3H8O3) and
various long-chain fatty acids: oleic acids (C18H34O2), linoleic acid
(C18H32O2), and palmitic acid (C16H34O). Disintegration and hydrolysis
steps are dependent on the activity of extracellular enzymes, such are
lipases, proteases, cellulases, and amylases [22]. As a rule, the hydro-
lysis is a relative slow process, but it can be accelerated by appropriate
pre-treatment processes [17]. The products of the hydrolytic reactions
are further transformed into CO2, NH3, H2S, and short-chain volatile
fatty acids (VFAs), such are acetic acid (C2H4O2), propionic acid
(C3H6O2), butyric acid (C4H8O2), and valeric acid (C5H10O2), by
appropriate acidogenic bacteria; the acidogenic bacteria exhibit a fast
growth rate and can survive in the extreme conditions [24]. The sub-
sequent reactions of VFAs are performed by the activity of acetogenic
bacteria. Although these reactions already produce a small amount of
CH4, the most important mechanisms to form CH4 are present in the
methanogenesis step, where acetotrophic methanogens ferment acetic
acid to CH4 and CO2 while hydrogenotrophic methanogens use H2 as a
reducing agent for the conversion of CO2 into CH4 [20,37–41]. The
methanogens are the most sensitive to the environment and they exhibit
the slowest growth among all AD microbial consortium [17]. Further-
more, by the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, the hydrogen sulfide
H2S is formed from hydrogen, acetic acid, and sulfate [20].

The most important biochemical reactions for degradations of com-
pounds through hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methano-
genesis are presented in Table 1 [15,20,31,42,43]. It has to be pointed
out that the reactions of degradations of propionic, butyric, and valeric
acids already include the hydrogen utilizing step [19].

The macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) are hy-
drolyzed during the AD process by appropriate enzymes. The microbial
biomass, represented by C5H7NO2 in Table 1, consists of various mi-
crobial groups of acidogens, acetogens, methanogens, and sulfate-
reducing bacteria; these microbial groups are involved in various
biochemical reactions to various extent. To enhance the biochemical
processes, biological additives, including various types of enzymes and
microbes, can be added.

The growth, activity, and inhibition of microbial cells, denoted by
C5H7NO2 in Table 1, depend on the feedstock and feeding strategy,
inorganic additives, instantaneous compounds concentrations in the
bioreactor, and instantaneous AD process conditions, especially pH
value and temperature [18]. A wide variety of substances have been
reported to be inhibitory to the AD processes. A substance may be
deemed inhibitory when it causes either an adverse shift in the microbial
population, or inhibition of microbial growth, or any other inhibitory
effect on any AD reaction. In praxis, the inhibitions of microbial growth
can be related to: (i) pH inhibition of all biological steps [43]; (ii)
hydrogen inhibition of acidogenic degraders (for uptake of glycerol, and

oleic acid) and acetogenic degraders (for uptake of propionic acid,
butyric acid, and valeric acid) [18,20,44]; (iii) hydrogen sulfide inhi-
bition of acetogenic degraders (for uptake of propionic acid, butyric
acid, and valeric acid), methanogenic degraders (for uptake of acetic
acid and hydrogen), and sulfate reducing bacteria (for uptake of sulfate,
propionic acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen) [20,45,46]; (iv) ammonia
inhibition of methanogenic degraders for uptake of acetic acid [20,29,
46]; (v) metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, ...) inhibitions of methanogenic de-
graders for uptake of acetic acid [18,20].

crobial growth, and consequently the biochemical processes [18,20].
For example, methane-forming microbes can only use undissociated
acetic acid; therefore, the consideration of the dissociation of nutrients
(e.g. acetic acid ...) and inhibitors (e.g. acetic and propionic acids,
long-chain fatty acids, H2S, NH3, and others) is very important [49].
Furthermore, total ammonia nitrogen, present in the form of NH3 and
+
NH
4 , inhibits the metabolism and activity of microbes. While process
+
inhibition by NH3 is rather well investigated, the effect of NH
4 is much
less studied. In this context, further research is needed since, for
example, Mlinar et al. [50] concluded that inhibition can be avoided to a
great extent and the processes stabilized by adjusting the pH-dependent
+
NH3/NH
4 ratio, when feeding nitrogen-rich substrates.

Complexation processes in the liquid phase involve various synthetic
chelating agents, which can be occasionally added into the bioreactor.
The added synthetic agents, such as ethyleneaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), and ethylenediamine-N,N′-dis-
uccinic acid (EDDS), influence the bioavailability of metal elements in
the AD process by forming stable soluble complexes and hence reduce
trace elements requirements [30]. Wang et al. [51] reported that humic
acid (HA), which contains various functional groups (phenols, carbo-
cyclic acids, and ketones) can react during the AD process of chicken
manure and corn stover with heavy metals (Co, Cu, Ni) through
adsorption and complexation reactions. Some of the most important
metal-ligand complexation pairs are Ca‐, Ca‐C2H4O, Mg‐, Ni‐,
Mg‐C2H4O, and Cu‐. The stability constants K0

Various adsorption, redox, and other chemical reactions of the AD
process (Table 4) include various trace elements, minerals, compounds,
nanoparticles (NPs), and conductive materials, such are Ni2+
, Co2+
,
Fe3+
, FeCl3, FeCl2, Fe2O3, Fe0, ZnO, biochar, etc. These
reactions also influence bioavailability of trace elements, which can
improve biogas quality by H2S removal and CO2 sequestration, improve
biogas and CH4 production, prevent foaming, and adjust nutrient con-
tent [27,52,53]. For example, Maharaj et al. [33] studied the fate of
trace elements by adsorption/desorption reactions including Ni2+
and
Co2+

and other trace elements.

Among the trace elements (Fe, Zn, Ni, Co, Mo, Cu, Mn, Se), which
considerably affect biogas production by enhancing or inhibiting mi-
crobial activity [15], iron in any form is the most important element
[54]. For example, the trace elements Fe2+/Fe3+
[27,29], as well as the
added compounds FeCl3 and FeCl2 can reduce H2S content in biogas
through redox reactions [15,55].

Furthermore, H2S can also be reduced by adding Fe2O3 NPs where
Fe2S3 and FeS are formed as well as by adding ZnO NPs where ZnS is
formed [56]. Zhu et al. [57] reported that the addition of ZnO NPs re-
duces H2S in the gas stream by 99 %; the produced H2S was first dis-
solved in the liquid phase, then dissociated into H
, and
(cid:0)
followed by the diffusion of HS
on
the hydroxide groups on the ZnO NPs surface. The added NPs influence
also the CH4 production. For example, by oxidation of Fe0 NPs into Fe2+
or by Schikorr reaction, H2 gas can be produced and consequently CH4
production is enhanced [28]. The added Fe0 NPs can directly serve as
electron donors for reducing CO2 into CH4 through methanogenesis,
leading to increased CH4 production [58,59]. Abdelsalam et al. [59]
have shown that the added Ni NPs yielded the highest biogas and CH4
production when compared to Co, Fe and Fe3O4 NPs. Besides the type of
NPs, their size and concentration also affect AD performance to a great
extent; a larger size and higher concentration often causes toxicity that
inhibits the methanogenesis activity. What seems to be obvious in
advance, however, is that among all NPs additives, the iron-based NPs
are the most attractive because they are biodegradable, inexpensive, and
probably non-toxic [52].

Conductive materials may significantly influence the cooperation
among various microbial groups by promoting electron exchange be-
tween electron-donating bacteria and methanogens. Such transfer can
be established via indirect interspecies electron transfer (IIET) or direct
interspecies electron transfer (DIET) [60,61]. During IEET, syntrophic
acetogens convert C2–C6 organic acids
to electron donors of
low-molecular weight, mainly H2, which may be consumed by metha-
nogens [62]. During DIET, the transfer of electrons between various
microbes takes place via electrically pili, cytochromes, and conductive
materials. The most frequently used conductive materials to stimulate
DIET are biochar, hydrochar, magnetite, hematite, carbon cloth, and
multi-walled or single-walled carbon nanotubes [63]. It is worth noting
that DIET is a faster and more efficient transfer than IIET [64]. As an

rate (CH3CH2CH2COO
In an AD process, it is assumed that the electrons released by oxidation
reactions are involved in the reduction reactions [65]; therefore, these
reactions of the AD process can be combined into one overall reaction
(Table 4). On the other hand, the microbial electron transfer has to be
considered in every detail in an electrically-enhanced AD processes. In
such bioelectrochemical systems, the microbes interact with electrodes
via the electron transfer through an external electrical circuit. One of the
frequently investigated bioelectrochemical systems is a microbial fuel

cell (MFC), where the electrical current is generated during the electron
transfer from anode to cathode. For example, in a two-chambers MFC
system the cathodic chamber is kept at aerobic conditions while the AD
process of organic waste takes place in the anodic chamber.

In general, additives can adsorb inhibitory compounds and promote
the formation of protective biofilms that allow microbes to grow under
more optimal conditions, but may also inhibit the AD process in case of
excessively high concentrations. Therefore, each practical AD imple-
mentation in a biogas plant necessitates the finding of optimal condi-
tions and concentrations of various additives in order to achieve the
desired CH4 production and other AD performances.

collected in Table 5 [47,68]. In the liquid phase, various metal ions
(contained in the feedstock and/or added into the bioreactor) react with
carbonate, sulfide, phosphate, and hydroxide (usually contained in the

bon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen (H2), ammonia
(NH3), water vapor (H2O) and various trace components varies in
dependence on the feedstock composition as well as on the process
conditions within the bioreactor [27].

2.2. AD key parameters

The most important parameters (Fig. 3) which influence AD perfor-
mance, are: (i) waste pretreatment parameters, (ii) feedstock composi-
tion and feeding strategy parameters, (iii) condition parameters, and (iv)
additive parameters [70]. To ensure good AD performance, it is of
outmost importance to determine optimal values of these key parame-
ters. In doing this, interaction among all parameters, especially feed-
stock composition, temperature, pH value, nutrients, HRT, OLR, and
additives should be considered [17,70]. Note that these key parameters
represent the entry points for introducing all kinds of design variables
when formulating an AD process optimization problem. So, especially in
advanced optimization scenarios, it is of outmost importance to keep a
summarized overview of these parameters in mind.

At this point it is worth mentioning that optimal values of these key
parameters may vary substantially in dependence on bioreactor design,
operating type (batch, CSTR), and configuration (one-stage, multi-stage)
[71]. For example, design and other bioreactor-related parameters affect
significantly the retention, growth, and acting of the microbes in the
bioreactor, and the separation between the acidogens and the metha-
nogens [72]. So, although currently full-scale single-stage AD systems
are still dominant due to the relative simplicity in design, build, and
operation [73], significant improvements are possible by optimizing the
bioreactor’s design along with its operational mode and by dividing
digestion into separate bioreactors (multi-stage AD system). This offers a
promising approach to improve the efficiency of the AD process.

2.2.1. Waste pretreatment

Waste pretreatment methods can enhance the AD process and
consequently influence the quantity and quality of produced biogas [12,
74]. These methods can be classified as (i) mechanical, (ii) chemical,
(iii) thermal, and (iv) biological [74,75].

In mechanical pretreatment through ultrasonification, microwave
irridation, and electro-kinetic disintegration, no chemical agents are
used. Instead, the waste particle size is reduced by a mechanical breakup
of organic components into smaller and more soluble fractions, which
increases the total particle surface area. This increases the probability of
contact between the substrate and the reactor’s microbial consortium
and consequently improves the AD process through increased biodeg-
radation rates [70]. Furthermore, smaller particle size promotes a more
homogeneous mixture in the bioreactor and consequently reduces the
difficulties related to material handling during mixing and pumping

Chemical pretreatment uses a variety of alkalis, acids, or oxidants
to decrease the biomass crystallinity, increase its porosity, remove
lignin, and thus, enhance the biomass surface availability for enzymatic
hydrolysis [74]. For example, various alkaline solutions in alkali pre-
treatment induce swelling and increase the effective surface area of
organic compounds, making the substrate more accessible to bacteria or
their enzymes. In acidic pretreatment, adequately diluted acids are most
frequently used since stronger acids can inhibit the AD process. In
oxidative pretreatment, hydrogen peroxide can be used to remove
hemicelluloses and lignin, resulting in an increase in cellulose content
and in CH4 production [74]. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide does not
generate inhibitory byproducts and unreacted chemical residues, which
represents the main advantage of this chemical [74,76].

By thermal pretreatment, the substrate structure is changed from
insoluble to soluble by applying heat; as a result, the biodegradability of
the substrate increases. Thermal pretreatment destroys the chemical
bonds of the cellular walls and the cellular components are released into
aqueous phase. Thermal pretreatment reduces significantly the time

required for hydrolysis. Consequently, HRT can be decreased by
reducing the volume of the reactor and consequently the related finan-
cial
investment. Commonly, the duration of thermal pretreatment
ranges from 30 to 60 min, the most frequently used temperatures are in
the interval [50–250
C], and the pressure is usually lower than 10 bar
[12,74]. However, the optimal choices of time, pressure, and tempera-
ture depend on the waste type and its components.

◦

In biological pretreatment various biological species are used.
Although these procedures can be time consuming, they are typically
cost-effective and environmentally friendly. In this context, ligninolytic
enzymes (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, laccase, ...) can
efficiently mineralize lignin into CO2 and H2O. The enzymatic and mi-
crobial pretreatments can be completed within one day, while the pre-
treatment with fungi requires long incubation periods up to few months
[70,77].

All of the various kinds of pretreatment methods can be used either
individually or combined by engaging two or more methods [78]. For
example, by using mechanical pretreatment with ultrasound, the cu-
mulative CH4 production can be increased up to 15 %. A chemical
pretreatment with KMnO4 can increase CH4 production up to 45 %.
However, by combining the ultrasound and KMnO4 pretreatments, the
cumulative CH4 production can increase up to 65 % [79].

2.2.2. Feedstock composition and feeding strategy

Feedstock parameters and feeding strategy are related to feedstock

composition, OLR, and HRT [80].

Feedstock may contain a wide range of simple and complex organic
compounds which can degrade during the AD process. Depending on
their sources (agricultural wastes, municipal,
food and industrial
wastes), specific organic compounds may predominate, which comes
with various consequences for the AD process [80]. For example, high
levels of carbohydrates may result in the rapid VFAs accumulation in the
reactor, decreased pH value, and suppressed methanogenesis. On the
other hand, protein rich substrates are rich in energy and produce a
relatively high amount of CH4 in the biogas, while high concentration of

ammonia can inhibit microbial growth and activities and can lead to
process instability. Furthermore, microbial inhibition and mass transfer
problems can be a consequence of fat rich organic compounds. There-
fore, an appropriate ratio of carbohydrate-rich, protein-rich, and fat-rich
organic materials is very important in order to reach the required
nutrient balance and microbial enrichment, to reduce the inhibitors
accumulation, and to increase the stability and high efficiency of biogas
production and CH4 yield. The availability of macro and micro-nutrients
has a great impact on the microbial efficiency of the AD process. Of
course, the required amounts of various nutrients and their balance
depend on the microbial types and process conditions. For example,
Song et al. [81] studied AD of organic fraction of municipal solid waste
in batch operating mode under mesophilic conditions; they concluded
that optimal feedstock composition was 32.8–43.6 % carbohydrate,
17–31.6 % protein, and 24.9–50.1 % lipid.

OLR, which represents the amount of organic solids which is loaded
per volume of the system per time, affects to a great extent the viability
of the microbes and their optimum activity. Loading of high amount of
organic materials into the system at once can lead to a shock which is a
consequence of higher activity of hydrolyzing and acidogenic bacteria.
This results in the accumulation of VFAs in the medium and possible
inactivation of all microbes due to the low pH value [82]. On the other
hand, a very low OLR leads to inefficient AD process, meaning that
optimal OLR is obviously needed; this optimum typically depends on
organic waste type and operating conditions.

HRT, which represents the average time spent by the substrate in the
reactor, influences directly the efficiency of AD process [83]. Lesser HRT
increases the risk of active biomass washout, whereas longer HRT re-
quires a larger volume of the reactor and hence a less economical design.
HRT depends on the type and construction of the bioreactor, as wells as
on feedstock and process parameters. The effect of an altered HRT on AD
process efficiency is very substrate-dependent [84]. Therefore, HRT
optimum will typically be unique for a particular biogas plant.

2.2.3. AD process conditions

The most important AD process condition parameters are tempera-

ture, pH value, and mixing parameters [5,12,85,86].

Temperature is the most important parameter because of its effects

on the microbial growth and activities, process kinetics and stability, as
well as on the quantity and quality of the produced biogas [87]. It is
known that each type of microbes requires their own optimal temper-
ature. The mesophilic microbes cannot survive in the thermophilic
temperature ranges, whereas thermophilic microbes can survive in
mesophilic temperature ranges, but their growth rate is slow [80]. In
general, AD microbes are very sensitive to temperature gradients [83].
◦
C because hydrolytic
Furthermore, the temperature must be below 65
enzymes can denaturate at higher temperatures [87]. Some in-
vestigations show that biogas production rate rises with increased
temperature, while the content of CH4 in the produced biogas reduces
[85]. So, while thermophilic temperatures promote higher biogas pro-
duction [12,82], mesophilic temperatures may deliver higher content of
CH4 in the produced biogas [88]. In order to obtain the desired quantity
and quality of the produced biogas while minimizing the energy needed
to heat the bioreactor, Kegl & Kovaˇc Kralj [19] have shown that in a
batch bioreactor the temperature has to vary during the AD process from
thermophilic to mesophilic conditions. This seems to be recommended
in general, but, of course, the precise optimal temperature history will
always depend on the actual AD biogas plant under consideration.

pH value influences microbial communities, AD performance, and
process stability. Each microbial group requires some optimum pH
range for its activity; any value below or above this range may quickly
become detrimental to these microbes [70]. For example, the pH range
of 5.5–6.5 is the most preferable for hydrolysis and acidogenesis. On the
other hand, the most suitable pH for acetogenesis and methanogenesis is
within the range of 7.0–8.5. Furthermore, pH value also plays a signif-
icant role in minimizing the inhibitory effects of VFAs and ammonia. In
order to obtain the desired quantity and quality of the produced biogas,
Kegl & Kovaˇc Kralj [19] have shown that in a batch bioreactor pH value
has to vary during the AD process. In praxis, this can be achieved by
adding various inorganic compounds and trace elements into the
bioreactor [15]. Of course, the quantities of such additives have to be
optimized in order to reach the optimal pH value history.

Mixing parameters such as mixing time and mixing intensity, as
well as parameters related to mixer design and working conditions, also
play an important role on biogas production. The optimal mixing pa-
rameters depend on the feedstock, pretreatment, and process conditions.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101199

For example, Singh et al. [21] concluded that at higher temperatures,
the mixing can be minimized to reduce power consumption and enhance
overall AD process efficiency.

2.2.4. Additives

In order to improve AD performance, various biological additives
(microbes and enzymes), carbon-based conductive additives (biochar,
granular activated carbon (GAC), graphene, graphite, carbon cloth,
carbon nanofibers, and multi-walled or single-walled carbon nano-
tubes), and inorganic additives (ferrous chloride, trace elements, min-
erals, nanomaterials, ...) can be used [89–92]. Specifically selected
microbes can improve the efficiency of biological processes and removal
of toxic or undesirable compounds from the AD process. Enzymes can be
considered as attractive harmless additives due to their ability to act in
the presence of toxic and non-degradable substances, as well as under
rapidly changing AD process conditions [93]. The carbon-based
conductive additives can increase CH4 production rate, decrease VFAs
accumulation, increase tolerance to inhibitors, and reduce the lag phase
in microbial growth [92]. Among these additives, biochar is practically
the most frequently used carbon-based conductive additive due to its
low production cost, extensive sources, and functionality [90–92].
Among inorganic additives, antifoaming agents [53], nanomaterials
(NMs) [53], various metals [94] and chemical compounds [89] are used.
In industrial biogas plants various commercial additives are frequently
used. For example, in the biogas plant discussed in Ref. [15], biological
additives containing enzymes (cellulase, xylanase, endo-1,4 ...) were
used to enhance hydrolysis; furthermore, inorganic additives, including
essential trace elements (Co, Cu, Na, Ni, Se, ...) and various compounds
(FeCl2, FeCl3, ...), were used to improve fermentation, reduce the pro-
duction of H2S, and prevent foaming during the AD process. Various
added metals form the sulfide, carbonate, and phosphate precipitates,
and more or less directly influence the pH value, microbial growth and
activities as well as the quality and quantity of the produced biogas. It
has to be pointed out that interactions of various additives are usually
not negligible. For example, Choong et al. [94] concluded that the
formed FeS precipitate can notably influence the solubility of the other
nutrient metals, such as Ni and Co.

3. Mathematical modeling of the AD process

Ideally, a mathematical model of the AD process should enable: (i)
prediction of the AD system behavior under various circumstances, (ii)
enhancement of AD performance by engaging numerical optimization,
and (iii) better insight into AD system behavior and its components’
interactions [16,22]. In this context, various AD models can be more or
less useful, depending on the actual needs in a specific problem at hand.
In general, there are three various categories of mathematical AD
models: (i) mechanistically inspired or white-box models, (ii) kinetic or
gray-box models, and (iii) phenomenological or black-box models [85,
95]. Mechanistically inspired mathematical models are based on the
underlying physics, biology, and chemistry, governing the behavior of
the AD process. These models provide good insight into the complex
mechanisms of the AD system; therefore, they are often the preferable
option for numerical simulation of the AD process. Commonly, these
models contain a rather large number of model parameters, which are
not generally known and need to be determined somehow in one or
another way. This is typically done by some kind of model calibration
with respect to adequate experimental data. However, although exper-
imental data is needed, the quantity of experimental data required for
calibration of mechanistically inspired models is the lowest among all
AD model categories. Kinetic models are based on usage of adequate
simplified equations, relating the AD performance to some input data.
These equations contain some unknown model parameters, which may
or may not have some physical interpretation and have to be estimated
somehow from known experimental data [96]. Typically, the amount of
experimental data needed is higher than the data needed for calibration

of mechanistically inspired AD models. Phenomenological models are
especially useful when the system mechanisms are unknown and when
there is a limited number of targeting outputs. These models are usually
build around some set of general-purpose basis functions, containing
unknown parameters such as weights and biases. These parameters have
no physical meaning; their values just have to be determined in such a
way that the input variables are transformed into output variables as
accurately and reliably as possible. The determination of these param-
eters requires a very high number of the data obtained from carefully
planned experiments. For this purpose, various design of experiments
(DoE) techniques are often used, such are fractional factorial types [97,
98],
types [99], central composite design [100],
Box-Behnken design [101], simplex centroid mixture design [102], and
Taguchi method [103]. To calibrate model parameters belonging to the
mechanistically inspired and kinetic models, as well as to estimate
weights and biases, belonging to the phenomenological models, various
stochastic or deterministic optimization methods are often used [25].

full

The most frequently used AD models, derived by mechanistical, ki-
netic, and phenomenological approaches, are collected in Fig. 4. As
shown, the number of needed experimental data increases from mech-
anistically inspired models to the phenomenological models, while the
usage of theory increases in the opposite direction.

The development of the most reliable AD models depends on the
knowledge about the theory of AD process and on the available exper-
imental data. The efficiency and reliability of these models can be esti-
mated by various statistical indicators (SIs) used to compare numerical
simulation and experimental data [15]. More precisely, the agreement
between measured and simulated AD performance (biogas and its
compounds production rate, pH, concentrations of components ...) can
be estimated by SIs, such are: (i) mean absolute error, εMAE, and relative
absolute error εRAE; (ii) root mean square error, εRMSE, and relative root
mean square error εrRMSE; (iii) coefficient of determination R2; and (iv)
relative index of agreement IA,rel. Since these indicators measure various
aspects of model performance, all of them have to exhibit acceptable
values for the model to be considered acceptable [15]. However,
perhaps the most frequently referred statistical indicator is the coeffi-
cient of determination R2.

The mechanistically inspired, kinetic, and phenomenological AD
models are discussed in Sections 3.1-3.3, while in Section 3.4 their ad-
vantages and disadvantages are addressed.

3.1. Mechanistically inspired AD models

To simulate the AD process, mechanistically inspired models rely on
the modeling of biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical processes,
described in Section 2; such models will be here denoted as “elementary
AD models”. These models enable the prediction of the concentration
dynamics of microbes and various components in the liquid, solid, and
gas phases during either batch or continuous operation of the bioreactor.
The elementary AD models can be enhanced by considering mass
transfer by diffusion and advection; such models will be here denoted as
“mass transfer enhanced AD models”. These models aim to improve the
prediction of AD performance by considering more precisely the inter-
action between solid substrate particulates and microbes. Apart from
this, in special cases a more precise velocity field might be needed as
well, for example, to determine more accurately the mixing process or to
optimize the reactor geometry. In such cases it becomes necessary to
couple the elementary AD models with the computational fluid dy-
namics (CFD) models; such models will be here denoted as “CFD
enhanced AD models”. Note that especially the introduction of CFD in-
creases drastically the complexity of the AD process modeling and comes
with additional difficulties.

Till today various more or less sophisticated elementary AD models

have been developed [21]. These models assume instantaneous and
complete mixing with homogeneous distribution of the solid substrate
particulates and microbes as well as uniform distribution of compo-
nents’ concentrations, pH value, and temperature in the whole biore-
actor [104]. Elementary AD models can be classified either as those
based on the BioModel with a mass-based unit system, proposed by
Angelidaki et al. [37,42] or those based on Anaerobic Digestion Model
No. 1 (ADM1). The ADM1 uses the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) for
component concentrations computation; it was proposed by the Inter-
national Water Association (IWA) Task Group for Mathematical
Modelling of Anaerobic Digestion Processes [105]. The BioModel was
primarily developed to deliver a good description of manure-based AD
systems [43], but was more recently extended for the AD process of more
complex substrates [15,20,106–109]. On the other hand, the ADM1 was
originally developed for the description of anaerobic wastewater treat-
ment processes [105], but was more recently extended for the descrip-
tion of organic waste bioconversion technologies [18,24,29,30,45,
110–113].

In general, mathematical modeling of the AD process includes
modeling of various biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical pro-
cesses in the bioreactor to form various intermediates and products
(Fig. 5). All biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical processes are
described by the equations of mass balance or concentration conditions,
various equilibrium equations, and equations of electro-neutrality con-
ditions or charge balances [27]. These equations consist of a system of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a system of algebraic equa-
tions (AEs), which can describe all relevant processes in the liquid, gas,
and solid phases as well as transitions between liquid-gas and
liquid-solid phases [18,29,30].

In the following, the main equations of up-to-date elementary AD
models are given in compact and as general as possible forms [15,18,20,
29,33,44,46,106,112–117]; the units of the involved quantities corre-
spond to the mass-based unit system. These elementary AD models track
the dynamics of the components in liquid, gas, and solid phases. Up to
five of the following groups of response variables may be involved in
these models to a various extent:

i) Concentrations of solid substrate particulates csSP,i, i ∈ IsSP; the set
IsSP of solid substrate particulates usually contains carbohydrates,

12

proteins,
lipids, and inert matter (the particulate material
emerging from the disintegration step and degraded in the hy-
drolysis step);

ii) Concentrations of soluble components in the liquid phase cliq,i,
i ∈ Iliq; the set Iliq of soluble components contains components,
such are sugar, amino acid, glycerol, oleic acid, total propionate,
total butyrate, total valerate, total acetate, inorganic carbon,
inorganic nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus, inorganic potassium,
inorganic sulfur in the form of sulfide or sulfate, hydrogen, and
methane; various species are present in all forms (ionic, free, and
total);

iii) Concentrations of microbial groups Xi, i ∈ Ibac; the set Ibac of
microbial groups contains various acidogenic, acetogenic,
methanogenic, and sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are involved
in biochemical reactions;

iv) Concentration of solid components cs,i, i ∈ Is; the set Is of solid
components contains mineral precipitates obtained from the
mineral precipitation processes involving specific soluble com-
pounds (Is typically contains carbonate, sulfide, phosphate, and
hydroxide precipitates);

v) Concentrations of biogas components cgas,i, i ∈ Igas; the set Igas of
biogas components includes methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen,
hydrogen sulfide, water vapor, and other gases, which are in
equilibrium with the corresponding components in the liquid
phase.

When the AD process runs in continuous mode, the mass balances
apply for: solid substrate particulates (Eq. (1)); soluble components in
the liquid phase (Eq. (2)); each microbial group (Eq. (3)); each
component emerging in the precipitation process (Eq. (4)); and each
biogas component (Eq. (5)). These mass balances can be defined as

b = 1 in case of uncompetitive inhibition.

Furthermore, to inhibit the growth rate of various microbial groups,
various inhibitors can be considered in the elementary AD models, such
are inadequate pH value, acetic and propionic acids, long-chain fatty
acids, H2S, NH3, and others. The pH effect on the growth rate of kth

Finally, it needs to be pointed out that microbial groups produce heat
due to their activities in biochemical reactions. Therefore, some ther-
modynamics- and heat-related aspects are presented briefly in the
following [120,121].

The heat from microbial activities can be determined by tracking the
changes in Gibbs free energy for various components uptake. The actual
Gibbs free energy ΔG
of any biochemical reaction, pre-
sented in Table 1, can be calculated as follows

values reach up to 30 kJ mol
hydrogen, and acetate, the ΔG values are negative; these values range up

degradations of valerate and butyrate are non-spontaneous, while the
degradations of all other compounds (glucose, amino acids, acetate,
hydrogen etc.) are spontaneous.

3.1.2. Mass transfer enhanced models

Mass transfer enhanced AD models gain relevance when the content
of TS (solid substrate particulates and microbes) raises above 15 %. They
aim to model more precisely mass transfer processes driven by diffusion
and advection. Within this context, diffusion is the transport of sub-
stances in a stationary solid or fluid under a concentration gradient,
while advection is the transport of substances achieved by the move-
ment of the fluid in the bioreactor. By diffusion, mass transfer enhanced
AD models try to address adequately the mass transfer process of soluble
(intermediate) products to microbial sites [16]. By advection, they try to
consider adequately the effects of spatial distribution and motion of
organic matter. Furthermore, they assume heterogeneous distribution of
solid substrate particulates and microbes [38,124].

Mass transfer of intermediate products, occurring between the solid
substrate particles and microbial cells, is driven by diffusion. This pro-
cess depends on the size of the microbes and solid substrate particulates
as well as on concentration gradient through a given surface area [38].
For example, due to the concentration gradient, sugar can diffuse into
the inside of microflora [125]. Li et al. [126] reported that free
ammonia, which diffuses into microbial cell, causes imbalance of pro-
tons. Furthermore, H2S, which is a product in the AD process, can easily
diffuse through a cell membrane into the cytoplasm. Once there, it can
denature native proteins through the formation of sulfide and disulfide
cross-links between polypeptide chains and consequently damage the
methanogens [126].

Two possible approaches, to model the transfer of intermediates
between solid substrate particles (waste particles, wp) and microbial
cells (seed particles, sp) by diffusion are the two-particle model [127]
and the core-shell diffusion model [128] (Fig. 6).

In the two-particle model, microbial cells are considered to be seed
particles with high methanogenic activity and low biodegradability,
while solid substrates are waste particles with low methanogenic ac-
tivity and high biodegradability [127]. This model assumes mass
transfer of intermediates between these particles (from wp to sp), driven
by diffusion. It is assumed that the concentration gradient of any
component is absent along the particle length. Furthermore, this model
does not permit exchange of bacteria between solid substrate particles.
The diffusion follows the Fick’s law and is taken into account by the
diffusion rate term, added to the physicochemical processes described
by Eqs. (1)–(5). The diffusion rate ρdiff,i of the ith solute can be written as

In a core-shell diffusion model, it is assumed that the core is repre-
sented by microflora (seed particles), which is surrounded by a substrate
shell (waste layer) in the form of small crowded waste particles [16,125,
128]. Furthermore, it is assumed that the concentration of the solute (for
example, sugar) at the outer surface of the waste layer is higher than in
the microflora due to the consumption of the solute by the microbes
[125]. This concentration gradient drives the diffusion of the solute in
the direction from the shell to the core [128]. The diffusion is assumed to
follow the Fick’s law, which is taken into account by an adequate
diffusion rate term that needs to be added to Eqs. (1)–(5). The diffusion
rate ρdiff,i of the ith solute transferring from the waste layer to the seed
particle can be written as [129]

vary by a factor higher than 1010 [125].

Besides of diffusion, mass transfer by advection is taken into account
by some distributed AD models [16,130–133]. These models assume
one- or more-dimensional heterogeneous mass distribution of solid
substrate particles and microbes and consider the effects of spatial dis-
tribution on the degradation of the organic matter. The one-dimensional
models are usually used to simulate the AD process in a bioreactor with
significant axial dispersion, such as in up-flow anaerobic sludge bed
(UASB) reactors [130] or in plug-flow reactors [131]. The diffusion and
advection transport phenomena for the ith solute can be considered by
adding the diffusion and advection rate ρdiff(cid:0) adv,i to Eqs. (1)–(5). For one-
and for multi-dimensional case this rate can be written as

is the advective

flow velocity with q denoting the flow velocity vector. At this point it is
worth noting that the authors of these models rather modestly address
the problem of how to estimate the advective flow velocity. One of the
exceptions to that is the work of Panaro et al. [131] where in a
one-dimensional model the advective flow velocity is derived by
considering constant density of the waste matrix and by requiring that
the sum of the volume fractions remains equal to unity.

It has to be pointed out that heterogeneous distribution of solid
substrate particulates and microbes, which is assumed by the mass
transfer enhanced AD models, substantially complicates the collection of
adequate experimental data by using traditional instrumentation [16].
The consequent lack of adequate experimental data is the reason that
currently these models are still not sufficiently validated. In this regard,
significant experimental efforts will still be necessary to gather the data
needed to verify the numerically obtained results as well as the as-
sumptions and additional parameters involved in the mass transfer
enhanced AD models.

3.1.3. CFD enhanced models

AD performance depends to a great extent on the mixing process in
the bioreactor since it promotes the contact between active microbes
and feed substrates, which enhances the whole AD process [86,134].
Sufficient mixing ensures homogeneous distribution of soluble sub-
strates and microbial cells, as well as pH value and temperature through
the whole bioreactor.

To investigate the mixing process in a bioreactor, hydrodynamics
modeling by employing CFD is often used [135]. The result of CFD
analysis is the flow behavior, most notably the velocity field and particle
trajectories. This can be exploited to identify both stagnant and
high-mixing-intensity zones, based on bioreactor geometry, feed loca-
tions, and operating conditions [86]. Since the overall flow pattern and
hydrodynamic characteristics are closely related to mixing [136], Dabiri
et al. [137] investigated the mixing process and the total energy con-
sumption needed for stirring to estimate the most suitable mixer rotation
speed. Furthermore, Li et al. [136] optimized the mixing performance
under suitable energy input and several geometric configurations.

CFD modeling of the fluid flow in a bioreactor is based on Navier-
Stokes equations: conservation of mass (Eq. (28)), conservation of mo-
mentum (Eq. (29)), and conservation of energy (Eq. (30)) [138–140].

In dependence on its viscosity, the fluid in the bioreactor can be
treated either as a Newtonian or a non-Newtonian fluid. The Newtonian
fluid has a constant viscosity, which can be assumed in a bioreactor with
low TS content in the substrate and high operating temperature. How-
ever, by increasing the TS content and lowering the temperature in the
bioreactor, the fluid behaves more like a non-Newtonian fluid, which
exhibits variable viscosity [21]. To address the governing partial dif-
ferential equations (PDEs) (Eqs. (28)–(32)), the Eulerian, Lagrangian, or
combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approaches may be adopted. In the
Eulerian approach the spatial coordinates are the independent ones and
the governing equations are written for a particle traversing a generic
observed point in space. On the other hand, in the Lagrangian approach

17

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101199

the material coordinates are the independent ones and the governing
equations are written for a generic observed particle travelling in space.
The numerical solution of the governing PDEs yields an approximate
solution in the observed domain; for this purpose, the unknown field is
often discretized by using the finite or boundary element method [104].
In this context, the reliability and time acceptability of CFD simulation is
significantly affected by factors like mesh density and quality, element
type, and time stepping scheme.

CFD provides a useful tool to investigate the mixing mode and power
consumption in the AD process of complex feed substrates [141].
Furthermore, mass and heat transfer during the AD process can also be
modeled with solid,
liquid, and gas phases included [16,86,135].
Furthermore, CFD also offers an attractive way to simulate turbulent

ensemble-averaged or time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, mean-
while LES solves the spatially averaged Navier-Stokes equations [104].
The fundamental PDEs (Eqs. (28)–(32)) are typically used in com-
mercial CFD software systems like ANSYS Fluent [135–137,142], ANSYS
CFX [143], and COMSOL Multiphysics [144], which are the most
frequently used CFD systems to simulate the AD process. Unfortunately,
these CFD codes do not provide an option to include the biochemical,
chemical, and physicochemical reactions into the simulation of an AD
process. In this view, investigation efforts are still underway in order to
couple the CFD and elementary AD models to get practically useable
CFD enhanced elementary AD models. It seems that till today the most
success was achieved by incorporating at least some simplified or partial
elementary AD models into the source terms present in Eqs. (28)–(32)
[135,142,145].

Dabiri et al. [145] integrated some parts of an elementary AD model
into the CFD model; various processes, such are hydrolysis, substrate
uptake, and degradation decay, have been included by appropriate
source terms. Rezavand et al. [142] proposed a direct link between some
biochemical reactions of the AD process and CFD supported hydrody-
namics. In the proposed smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model,
the computational domain was discretized by particles, each of which
carries the information of biologically active compounds and follows the
flow field. The biochemical reactions are integrated over time for each
particle, which allows to spatially resolve the concentrations of biolog-
ical compounds. The mass transfer interactions between particles are
reproduced by the diffusion equation, which links directly the mixing
process to biochemical reactions, while the total biogas production is
obtained by integrating over all particles. The obtained results show that
the SPH model makes it possible to study the impact of mixing on biogas
production. Furthermore, Tobo et al. [135] reported that the integration
of hydrolysis and biomass growth equations of the elementary AD model
into the CFD model helps to understand the impact of diffusion on
anaerobic digestion mixing. They implemented a part of ADM1 model
(hydrolysis and microbial growth modeling) as user functions into the
source term of the used CFD model. They concluded that the contribu-
tion of molecular and turbulent diffusion transport has a significant role
in the homogenization of AD and that it should be considered in the
optimization of the AD mixing process [135]. They also suggested that
the mixing in AD bioreactors is tied more to concentration distributions
than to traditional velocity distributions, which is typically adopted in a
CFD hydrodynamics model.

models are collected in Tables 7b and 7c, respectively. One may note
that in comparison to the elementary models, the mass transfer and CFD
enhanced models are rather rarely implemented for AD process
simulation.

The elementary mechanistically inspired models in Table 7a are
ranked with respect to their complexity. The definition of the complexity
measure is a rather delicate and ambiguous issue. For this reason, in this
work a normalized complexity factor ξc was introduced, which includes
various model characteristics. In this definition, the relative importance
of a particular model characteristic is specified by a corresponding
weighting factor. The choice of these weighting factors is also a delicate
issue due to the lack of universally applicable criteria. Anyhow, in this
work the complexity factor ξc was defined as

c,BM denotes the ξ*

where ξ*
c evaluated for the base model (BM) described
in Refs. [37,42]. The symbols ψ sSP, ψ s, ψ liq, and ψ gas denote the numbers
of the considered solid substrate particulates, components in the solid
phase, soluble components in the liquid phase, and biogas components,
respectively. Furthermore, ψ ODEs, ψ pH, ψ bac, ψ inh, and ψ MPs denote the
numbers of considered ODEs, ionic components included into ionic
equilibrium to determine the pH value, microbial types, inhibitors, and
model parameters, respectively.

The complexity factors of elementary mechanistically inspired AD
models (Table 7a) increase from 1 (base model) up to 5 (very complex
models developed in recent years). It may be worth noting that only a
few of the models listed in Table 7a [15,18,20,27,29,30,114,117,157,
160,161,163,164] have the complexity factor ξc higher than 3. These
models take into account the majority of the biochemical, chemical, and
physicochemical processes described in Section 2.1. Unfortunately,
increasing model complexity unavoidably leads to a more difficult
calibration process with higher demands on accuracy. For example, the
daily variation of feedstock composition/quantity is often neglected,
although should be taken into account to meet the calibration-related
requirements.

Although quite some of the listed models were developed or tested by
using estimated model parameters, one can argue that at least the most
important parameters have to be calibrated [114,161]. Moreover, some
investigations suggest that practically all model parameters should be
calibrated due to their interactions [15,20,117]. Once the model is
calibrated, it is very important that a satisfactory agreement of predicted
and measured AD characteristics is confirmed by adequate SIs. These
indicators have to exhibit satisfactory and similar values in both, cali-
bration and validation procedures; differences of more than 5 % be-
tween the calibration and validation indicators hint at possible
underfitting or overfitting of the AD model [15,44,114].

The mass transfer and CFD enhanced mechanistically inspired

3.2. Kinetic AD models

Various kinetic models may offer an attractive option to predict AD
performance in batch mode bioreactors. These models were developed
by adopting two assumptions that simplify the modeling significantly.
These two assumptions are: (i) microbial concentration is the only
responsible for biogas/ CH4 production and (ii) microbial growth is
limited only by the hydrolysis rate and substrate availability [16]. The
models based on these assumptions can be used to predict the biogas/
CH4 production kinetics when feeding various waste types and under
various feedstock-related parameters (waste pretreatments, inoculum
types, additives, ...). Furthermore, these models can identify the bot-
tlenecks that limit biogas/ CH4 production and the lag phase time tlag,
which depicts the microbial adaptation to the substrates [170]. The most
frequently used kinetic AD models belong to one of the following groups:
first-order kinetic models, logistic models, and Gompertz models [95,
170–175]. These models include only a few unknown kinetic parame-
ters, which have to be fitted by using the experimentally obtained AD
performance data. In order to find the model that best describes the
degradation kinetics of the studied feedstocks, single-stage kinetic or
multiple-stage kinetic modeling may be adopted [176]. In single-stage
modeling, the single kinetic (SS-SK) model or the combined kinetic
(SS-CK) models are applied to the whole digestion period. On the con-
trary, in the multiple-stage kinetic (MSK) modeling, various kinetic
models are used for various time subintervals of the digestion period
(Fig. 7).

3.2.1. Single-stage single kinetic models

The most frequently used single-stage single kinetic (SS-SK) models
are based on the first-order kinetic, logistic, or Gompertz model [170,
171,176].

First-order based kinetic models. A first-order kinetic model relies
on the assumption that hydrolysis governs the overall process and the
substrate supply is the limiting factor [171]. The basic form of this
model, which includes two unknown parameters, assumes that AD
performance follows the first-order kinetics [177]. By this assumption,
the response curve can be written as

y = y0

performance can be biogas/ CH4 production in (L) or biogas/ CH4 yield

. By substituting the kinetic constant k by the ratio of
maximum AD performance and its potential and by introducing the lag
phase in the first-order kinetic model, the transfer model with three

Logistic-based models. The logistic model is well suited for the
kinetics analysis of those AD processes, where the AD performance
rapidly increases in the initial phase of the process and subsequently
reaches a stable level [172,177]. The basic logistic model (Eq. (37))
[179], and the modified logistic model (Eq. (38)) [174,180], which both
involve three unknown parameters, can be written as

compounds. To analyze the kinetics of such AD systems by using SS
modeling, till today various SS-CK models were developed by coupling
various kinetic models. Wang et al. [187] coupled the first-order kinetic
model with the modified Gompertz model. This SS-CK model contains 5

3.2.3. Multiple-stage kinetic modeling

As mentioned, high TS content, waste pretreatment, and additives
usage may result in the cumulative CH4 production curve exhibiting a
stepped shape with two or more daily CH4 production peaks. In such
circumstances, MSK modeling becomes an attractive option [176]. To
build the most suitable MSK model, various kinetic models can be used.
For example, at the initial phase of the AD process the more readily
degradable materials are consumed, causing the biogas/ CH4 production
curve to follow a first-order pattern. Therefore, in the first time interval
the first-order kinetic model is usually a very good choice. As the AD
process progresses, more recalcitrant materials are made available,
leading to delayed biogas/ CH4 production, which is often manifested by
a sigmoidal shape of the actual response curve. Therefore, in these time
intervals the logistic and Gompertz based models are typically more
appropriate. For example, Pellera & Gidarakos [176] proposed an MSK
model of the following form

where ν ( /) is the response curve shape coefficient.

Gompertz-based models. To analyze the kinetics and productivity
capacity of organic residues for biogas/ CH4 production, a commonly
employed model is based on the Gompertz equation. The Gompertz
model assumes that AD performance is proportional to the substrate
level and to microbial mass [181]. Both, the basic Gompertz model (Eq.
(40)) [182,183], and the modified Gompertz model (Eq. (41)) [53,
183–185], include three unknown parameters, as follows

3.2.2. Single-stage combined kinetic models

In an AD process of substrates with high TS content it may quickly
happen that the cumulative CH4 production curve exhibits a stepped
shape with two or more daily CH4 production peaks [186]. This is
especially true if waste pretreatment is engaged and additives are used
since such circumstances may lead to increased variations in degrada-
tion rates of various groups of organic compounds. The first peak is due
to rapid utilization of the readily biodegradable organic compounds by
microbes, while the second and possible following peaks are caused by
subsequent degradation of poorly biodegradable organic

3.2.4. Frequently referred implementations of kinetic AD models

A list of frequently referred kinetic AD models, developed in the last
years, is given in Table 8. For each mathematical model, characterized
by the type and equation, the data given are related to numerical
implementation and model application. The numerical implementation
data is related to AD performance output characteristic, calibration
dependency (reflecting the need for a new calibration in case of a change
in the specified parameters), and the used code language or software
(CL/SW). The application data is related to the type of waste used as
feedstock and AD process conditions.

(45)

For these kinetic models, the SIs achieved by model calibration are
typically reported, while the SIs of model validation are rarely given.
Therefore, these models are ranged with respect to the accuracy factor ξa

This model (Eq. (45)) considers five time intervals of the AD period
by five kinetic models (one first-order kinetic and 4 modified logistic
models); it contains 14 unknown parameters.

It is obvious that the number of unknown parameters in such MSK
models depends on the number of the AD time intervals considered and

The accuracy factors ξa suggest that despite their simplicity, the ki-
netic models may offer an efficient way to estimate some of the
important AD output characteristics with reasonable accuracy. This can
be achieved for AD processes involving various substrates and various
process conditions. Usually, the reliability of these models was investi-

gated with respect to the TS content, substrate types, pretreatment
types, and additives. In this context, Karki et al. [170] have shown that
substrate type is the key parameter influencing the selection of best-fit
kinetic model. For single substrates, the modified Gompertz model has
usually proven to be the best-fit option among various tested SS-SK
models [172,173,177–180,189,191,197]. On the other hand, for com-
plex substrates with higher TS content, the SS-CK models enable better
fitting when compared to SS-SK models. Often, a good combination is
obtained by the coupling of either the first-order kinetic and the modi-
fied Gompertz model [170] or several modified Gompertz models [170].
In the case of using various substrate types and various substrate to
inoculum ratios, Pellera & Gidarakos [176] have shown that among
various kinetic models (SS-SK, SS-CK, MSK), the best fitting to the
experimental data (ξa = 1) can usually be obtained by using an adequate
MSK model.

3.3. Phenomenological AD models

Phenomenological AD models are not derived from the first princi-
ples. So, these models do not require a deep understanding of the
biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical processes taking place
during AD. Till today, quite some types of phenomenological models
were developed with the aim to simulate with reasonable accuracy AD
performance in various types of bioreactors.

In general, these models are based on various machine learning (ML)
technologies (unsupervised learning, reinforced learning, and super-
vised learning) as one of the key technologies for implementing the
artificial intelligence [198–200]. Unsupervised learning, as well as
reinforced learning are rarely used for the prediction of AD performance.
So, the most frequently used phenomenological AD models are based on
supervised learning technologies, which may be based on various
regression models, neural networks, support vector machines and others
[201]. The usage of these ML methods for AD simulation requires at least
two stages: (i) model training stage and (ii) model validation stage
(Fig. 8). In the training stage the AD model learns from the training data,
which are usually obtained by experiments. The set of training data,
consisting of input-output pairs, has to be constructed in an adequate
way. In the input-output pair (x,y), the vector x = [x1, x2, ...xM]T denotes
the data vector of M independent variables (features) which exhibit a
significant impact on the response variable y. Although the AD features

used in a particular AD model implementation may be quite diverse,
they can usually be classified into one of the following three groups:

(i) feeding substrate fractions and composition (organic municipal
waste, corn stover, corn silage, vegetables waste, sewage sludge,
wastewater, food waste, various animal manures, TS, VS, SS,
carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, COD, elements, compounds, ions,
ionic compounds ...);

(ii) additives (various microbes, enzymes,

trace elements, anti-

foaming agents, biochar, dosage and size of nanomaterials ...);

(iii) AD process conditions (temperature, pH value, electrical con-

ductivity, pretreatments, OLR, HRT ...).

Meanwhile, the response variable is usually related to biogas yield/
production, biogas composition, VFAs concentration, and others. The
training data set, consisting of N samples, can be expressed as Idata =
{
(x, y)
i

, i = 1...N

}

.

For model training, the most common supervised tasks are “classi-
fication” that separates the data and “regression” that fits the data; the
later one is most frequently used for AD modeling. The final result of the
training stage is a phenomenological AD model, which establishes the
relationship y = f(x). The obtained phenomenological AD model has to
be validated by simulating AD performance with new input data x* to
get y* = f(x*). For both, training and validation stages, the reliability,
efficiency, and accuracy of the AD model can be estimated by various
SIs, obtained by comparing the measured and simulated AD
performance.

In the following, the construction, architecture, and key principle of
the ML regression-based methods, used in the phenomenological AD
modeling, are presented briefly.

3.3.1. Regression models

To predict AD performance, various regression models with various
number of features have been developed so far. For illustration only
(Fig. 9) shows examples of a simple linear and non-linear regression
graphs with one feature and a multiple linear one involving two
features.

Simple and multiple linear regression (LR) models describe the
represented by a vector of

relationship between AD features,

independent variables x, and output AD process parameter, being the
dependent variable y. This relationship can be written as

y = wTx + b =

∑

M

i=1wixi + b

(47)

where w is the vector containing adequate weights, b is bias, and M is the
number of features. When the model contains only one feature (M = 1),
the model exhibits its simplest form and only one weight w1 and the bias
b need to be calibrated [191]. In case of two or more features (M > 1)
one has a multiple LR model with the obvious need to calibrate more
parameters [191,202]. Due to the non-linear relationship between the
most of the AD performances and the selected features, LR exhibits poor
estimation accuracy and poor possibility of generalization. Therefore, a
better prediction of AD performance can be reasonably expected by
using non-linear regression (NLR) models [203]. An example of such a
model can be written as

y =

∑M

∑M

∑M

i=1

j=1

k=1

wijkxixjxkexi + b

(48)

where wijk and b are the corresponding weights and the bias. The NLR
models proposed so far typically involve several AD features used to
determine one AD performance [204,205].

3.3.2. Random forest model

A regression random forest (RF) model, which combines outcomes
from a sequence of regression decision trees to generate the final pre-
diction (Fig. 10) can be used to predict various AD characteristics. A
random forest operates by constructing several decision trees during
training time and outputting the average output as the prediction of all

trees [206].

RF adopts the bootstrap resampling method to randomly form Ntree
sample sets Idata,k, k = 1...Ntree from the original sample set Idata (training
data) [199]. For each sample set Idata,k, a decision tree is constructed by
using Nnode nodes and Nsplit splits. In the process of generating the de-
cision tree model, each node is defined by considering only Mtry
(Mtry < M) randomly selected features from the set of all M features. The
final RF model output is obtained by simple averaging all individual tree
predictions yk [207] as
∑

y = 1
Ntree

k

yk;

k= 1...Ntree

(49)

where Ntree is the total number of trees and k represents the current tree.
The main tuning parameters are related to the number of trees in the
forest, Ntree, the number of features randomly sampled as candidates at
each node split, and the number of nodes in the trees. The RF model is an
attractive option for its implementation in AD modeling, since it shows
superior performance when interacting with large, high dimensional,
noisy, and imbalanced data. Furthermore, it provides information on the
importance of features, it exhibits a high tolerance for missing data, and
largely avoids overfitting problems [208].

3.3.3. Support vector machine model

The support vector machine (SVM) modeling (Fig. 11) has solid
theoretical foundations and offers generous generalization capabilities.
The SVM exhibits great performance in high-dimensional function
approximation problems due to the use of the kernel technique, which
maps feature vectors to a higher dimensional space [208]. By using the
chosen features x and given training data (x, y)
, i = 1...N, the support

vectors (SVs) are selected by using an ε -insensitive loss function ξε and
the prescribed distances ξi and ξ*
i of the training data points (Fig. 11).
The parameter ε controls the width of the ε -insensitive zone used for
fitting the training data and influences the number of support vectors sj,
j = 1...Ns; smaller values of ε lead to higher number Ns.

SVM constructs a linear regression by mapping the vectors x and sj to

margin constant C regulates the penalty; this penalty parameter de-
termines the trade-off between the flatness of the regression function
and the amount to which deviations larger than ε are tolerated.

Among the ML models, SVM has proven to be highly competitive in a

range of real-world scenarios in the AD field [210–213].

3.3.4. Artificial neural network models

An artificial neural network (ANN) model simulates the functioning
of biological neurons and implements various learning processes
imitating those going on in human brain. In an ANN model, the number
of input and output AD parameters is equal to the number of neurons
present in the input and output layers, respectively. Meanwhile, the
number of neurons in the hidden layers has to be adapted to the AD
system to be approximated and to the training algorithm [214,215]. In

Fig. 12. ANN model.

26

T. Kegl et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101199

general, a low number of neurons in the hidden layers causes high
training errors and high generalization errors due to underfitting [171].
On the other hand, a high number of neurons in the hidden layers may
result in low training errors, but still high generalization errors due to
overfitting.

jk and biases bh

The architecture of a basic ANN model with one hidden layer is
presented in Fig. 12. The value stored in each neuron in the hidden layer
and in the output layer depends on the weights and biases, which are
determined during the training stage. To compute the predicted
response, the input layer takes the values of M input neurons xj, cor-
k , j = 1...M, k = 1...H; this input is
rected by weights wh
transformed by H neurons in the hidden layer by using appropriate
transfer functions f h
t,k and activation functions f h

Good choices for the activation functions in the hidden and output
layers are the linear function (purelin), the logistic sigmoid function
(logsig), and the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function (tansig) (Fig. 12). In
this way, each AD performance y can be described in dependence of M
independent variables assembled in x.

To build an effective ANN model, an extensive input-output data
pairs set (x, y)
, i = 1...N, an adequate network topology (number of
i
neurons in various layers), and well-chosen forms of transfer and acti-
vation functions are necessary. In AD modeling, practical experience has
shown that this can be done in a relatively satisfactory manner [171,
204,210,215–219].

3.3.5. Frequently referred implementations of phenomenological AD models
Model parameters of ML-based models are tuned/calibrated/esti-
mated by the model itself. This is achieved by model training (calibra-
tion) where these parameters are determined according to a given
optimization strategy in order to minimize the error between the pre-
dicted and experimental values of output parameters. Quite often, the
accuracy of these models is estimated by the statistical indicator R2,
achieved during model training. But since R2 achieved during model
testing (validation) is obviously also important, it makes sense to esti-
mate the efficiency of the model in dependency of both indicators. So,
some of the recently published and most frequently used phenomeno-
logical ML AD models, for which both indicators were reported, are
collected in Table 9. This table also contains the most important data
related to model type with its characteristics and features (input vari-
ables). Furthermore, numerical implementation data includes output
parameters along with the corresponding statistical indicator R2, ob-
tained by the calibration of model parameters, used method for model
parameter (MPs) calibration, and used CL/SW. The application data is
related to the biogas plant design, operating mode (BM, CM, sCM), and
used feedstock.

)
tra values are higher
than 0.7, which looks relatively satisfactory. However, if the ξoa factor is
adopted to estimate the overall accuracy of the model, one can see that
some models perform relatively poorly. Among these, one can mostly
find RF and simple LR models, although ANN models are also present.
The inferior performance of these models is obviously at least partially
due to overfitting, as indicated by quite high values of the corresponding
ξfit factors. On the other end of the scale, one can mostly find ANN and
SVM models, exhibiting the ξoa factors close to one. According to this,
among the ML model variants the SVM and properly designed ANN
models seem to be the most attractive options for prediction of time-
dependent AD response.

3.4. Advantages and disadvantages of various AD models

Mechanistically inspired, kinetic, and phenomenological models
differ rather substantially with respect to the complexity and type of
needed input data as well as with respect to delivered AD response in-
formation. In this sense, they can not be seen as direct competitors but
rather as potentially good choices for specific circumstances. Mecha-
nistically inspired models seek to establish a mechanistic relationship
between input and output variables of the AD process. Meanwhile,
phenomenological and kinetic models seek to establish these relation-
ships and correlations in a statistical manner. While mechanistically
inspired models provide the causality which is missing from kinetic and
phenomenological models, their assumptions greatly hinder or prevent
the prediction of very complex processes (e.g. foaming in the bioreactor)
achievable by phenomenological models. So, in general, the advantages
of phenomenological as well as kinetic models are the disadvantages of
mechanistically inspired models and vice versa. The most important of
these advantages and disadvantages, exhibited by the most frequently
used AD models, are summarized in Table 10.

The accuracy of phenomenological and kinetic AD models can be
improved to the acceptable level by increasing the quantity and quality
of training data, by proper selection of appropriate features, and by
adequate architecture of the selected algorithm. On the other hand, the
accuracy of the mechanistically inspired models can be increased by
better knowledge of the actual processes and mechanisms during the
whole AD process in the bioreactor and by more accurate determination
or calibration of model parameters.

All adjustable parameters in the phenomenological and kinetic
models indicate the importance of the influence of certain variables on
AD performance; however, these parameters do not provide any insight
into the mechanisms inside the AD process. Beside of the interpretability
problem, another disadvantage is related to the large amount and the
diversity of the data required to construct a robust and accurate model.
On top of this, the problems related to underfitting and overfitting
should also not be underestimated. On the other hand, mechanistically
inspired models require deep knowledge about the processes, mecha-
nisms, and reactions during the AD process. So, perhaps their main
disadvantages are related to the difficulties encountered in determining
the correct biochemical, kinetic, and stoichiometric model parameters,
such are dissociation equilibrium constants, microbial growth rates,
liquid-gas transfer coefficients, Henry’s law coefficients, solubility
product constants, and others.

For the sake of convenience, it may be helpful to compare the AD

across the following five performance metrics:

(i) Applicability, which refers to the capacity of the model to
deliver reasonable accurate results for input data being fairly out

where x and q are the vectors of design and response variables,
respectively. In case of AD process optimization, the design vector x
contains all AD input parameters that can be varied independently by
the optimizer in order to search for the best possible response of the AD
system. Furthermore, the response vector q assembles all variables that
are computed during AD process simulation and represent the response
of the AD system. It is important to note that in this context x is the
independent variable while q depends on x. This dependence, written as
q = q(x), is given by the AD model used in the optimization procedure.
The imposed constraints typically reflect various AD-related re-
quirements or limitations, while the objective function must measure
the quality of AD performance. The objective function is often not easily
defined since one typically has to deal with multiple objectives such as
good biogas quality, good digestate properties, good effluent quality,
and low energy consumption [26]. If all involved functions are linear
with respect to x, the optimization problem is termed a linear pro-
gramming (LP) problem; otherwise, it is a nonlinear programming (NLP)
problem.

The AD optimization procedure can be illustrated by the flowchart
shown in Fig. 14. The procedure is iterative and always starts from some
initial design. Note that stochastic methods often operate on a whole set
of designs rather than on a single design, but the procedure is essentially
the same. Within each iteration, the current design is improved by
performing one full optimization step. Successive optimization steps
have to be repeated until a satisfactory (optimal) design is obtained.
Within each optimization step, the AD model is used one or more times
to compute the response of the AD system as well as all related data
needed by the currently engaged optimization method. Using these data,
the optimization method improves the design, which in turn is used as
the current design in the next optimization step. The rate of convergence
of this iterative procedure depends to a great extent on the complexity of
the chosen AD model and on the selected optimization method.

Optimization methods can be classified either as deterministic or

quently exhibit poor accuracy for some out-of-sample input data.

4. AD process optimization

Reliable and efficient mathematical models for numerical AD simu-
lation are of fundamental importance for AD process optimization. In
general, systematic optimization is a solution process of an optimal
design problem, where the objective function go (Eq. (54)), has to be
minimized, subject to m1 inequality constraints gi (Eq. (55)), and m2
equality constraints hi (Eq. (56)). This problem can be written as [19]

stochastic ones [25]. Furthermore, a distinction between gradient-based
and gradient-free methods is useful since the later ones can usually be
implemented much more easily. The methods most frequently used for
the solution of AD optimization problems are shown in Fig. 14. The
mostly used deterministic methods are both, gradient-based and
gradient-free. The stochastic methods are of two types, heuristic and
meta-heuristic, with the later ones being more frequently used in AD
optimization. Meta-heuristics methods can be either trajectory- or
population-based. It looks that the later ones, where multiple potential
solutions move towards the final solution simultaneously, are more
popular. Although stochastic optimization methods can be also
gradient-based, in AD optimization the gradient-free ones seem to be the
preferred option.

The deterministic and stochastic optimization methods, most
frequently used in the field of AD optimization, are discussed in Sections
4.1-4.2, while Section 4.3 deals with their advantages and
disadvantages.

4.1. Deterministic methods

In general, deterministic methods follow a rigorous procedure so that
they repeat the same path and provide the same solution when running
several times with the same input data.

4.1.1. Gradient-based optimization methods

Gradient-based optimization methods require the determination of
gradient information for the objective and constraint functions in order
to perform one step of design improvement; the gradients have to be
computed with respect to design variables. For AD optimization, the
most frequently used methods are sequential quadratic programming
(SQP), generalized reduced gradient (GRG), and a particular type of an
approximation method (AM). Note that approximation methods are a
wide family of quite diverse optimization methods. In this paper, the
term approximation method (AM) will be used to denote only one
particular method described in the following.

The SQP method is recognized as one of the most effective optimi-
zation techniques for solving constrained NLP optimization problems. In
each step the method generates a quadratic programming (QP) sub-
problem by linearizing the constraints and adopting some kind of a
quadratic approximation for the objective function [224]. In this way

the QP sub-problem is given by

min
d

∇g0(x, q)T d + 1
2

dT H g0(x, q) d

gi(x, q) + ∇gi(x, q)Td ≤ 0, i = 1...m1

hi(x, q) + ∇hi(x, q)Td = 0, i = 1...m2

(57)

(58)

(59)

where x is a fixed approximate solution obtained in the previous opti-
mization step and d represents the unknown search direction vector
needed for design improvement in the current step. Furthermore, H is
usually some more or less accurate approximation of the Hessian of the
Lagrangian function

L (x, q, λ, μ) = g0(x, q) + λ gi(x, q)T + μ hi(x, q)T

(60)

where λ and μ are the vectors of Lagrangian multipliers, corresponding
to inequality and equality constraints, respectively. After solving the QP
sub-problem for the vector d, the new improved design is obtained as x +
αd, where the step size α has to be determined by a separate line search
minimization procedure. A generic form of the SQP method algorithm is
shown in Fig. 15.

So far, the SQP method has been used successfully to calibrate the
model parameters of various kinetic models [225] as well as for AD
process optimization [226].

methods; its algorithm is shown in Fig. 16. By this method the inequality
constraints gi(x) ≤ 0 are replaced by equality constraints hi(x) + si = 0
using slack variables s. Furthermore, with respect to m equality con-
straints, the n design variables x are partitioned into (n (cid:0) m) independent
variables z and m dependent variables y. The independent variables are
used to improve the objective function, while the dependent variables
are used to satisfy the binding constraints [227,228]. The optimal design

The particular type of the AM method addressed in this work is
based on a special nonlinear and adjustable approximation of objective
and constraint functions. The utilized approximation enables to obtain
approximate functions with variable conservativeness, which implies an
adjustable approximate problem [230,231]. To achieve this, auxiliary
design variables yj are introduced within each optimization step. These
auxiliary variables are defined as

subject to constraints λ ≥ 0. This problem is solved by a simple iterative
procedure based on the gradient ∇L (̂y, λ) which serves as the search
direction dλ [231]. The flowchart diagram of the whole AM algorithm is
presented in Fig. 17.

The presented approximation method was used quite successfully for
AD optimization with various objective and constraint
functions,
various design variables and various feedstock substrates. This refers to
the case of a lab-scale biogas plant operating in batch mode [19,116] as
well as to the case of a full-scale biogas plant operating in continuous
mode [15,20].

4.1.2. Gradient-free optimization methods

The Simplex method relies on a geometric figure formed by n + 1
points in an n-dimensional space. The objective function g0 is computed
at each vertex xi, i = 1...n + 1 of the simplex. Using this information, the
simplex is moved in the search space and the objective function g0(xi) is

computed again at each vertex of the simplex. The process of moving the
simplex is continued until the optimum value of the function is reached
[232]. To move the simplex in the search space, three basic operations
are required: reflection, contraction, and expansion. The Nelder-Mead
algorithm of the Simplex method, including the computation of the
centroid point xc, reflected point xr, expanded point xe, and contracted
point xcontr, is presented in Fig. 18. The worst point xworst, where the
value of the objective function g0 is the largest, is excluded from the
computation of the centroid point xc. If the calculated reflected value xr
does not show improvement of g0, the second worst point is taken and
the process is repeated. In the case that xr is a new minimum point, then
it is possible to further expand the new simplex in the hope of further
reducing the value of g0; if the g0 of the expanded point xe is the new
minimum, xe replaces the xworst point; otherwise, xworst is replaced by xr.
The contraction operation is used when it is certain that the reflected
point is better than the 2nd worst point.

Among others, the Nelder-Mead Simplex method was used success-
fully in optimizing the start-up of an AD process [233]. In this work, the
difference between the calculated and measured CH4 production was
reduced by optimizing the values of time evolution of the OLR, the
blends of substrates corresponding to each OLR, and HRT.

4.1.3. Practical application of deterministic optimization methods in the
field of AD

For the sake of convenience, the most important data related to
practical applications of deterministic AD optimization procedures are
collected in Table 11.

From Table 11 it is evident, that deterministic optimization methods
can be used quite successfully for model parameters calibration of
various mechanistically and kinetic AD models as well as for AD process
optimization. In general, these deterministic optimization methods tend
to deliver the local optimum being located the nearest to the starting
point. Under some circumstances, for example in case of a large number
of design variables, this local solution may be quite far from the global
optimum. To mitigate this inconvenience, various strategies are
possible. For example, by using the active set optimization (ASO) pro-
cedure, a gradient-based AM was shown to deliver quite stable result
irrespective of the choice of the starting point [15,116].

4.2. Stochastic methods

In contrast to deterministic methods, the stochastic methods exhibit
the following characteristics: (i) they exhibit some randomness, (ii) they
produce different solutions in different runs, and (iii) the required
computational effort is substantial. The main advantage is that these
methods explore several regions of the search space simultaneously and
consequently are more likely to reach the global optimum [25]. Among
all stochastic optimization methods used in relation to AD systems, the
most frequently used is the genetic algorithm, followed by the particle
swarm and the ant-colony optimization methods. Stochastic optimiza-
tion methods tend to be quite convenient when phenomenological or
simple mechanistically inspired AD models are engaged and the number
of design variables is not too high.

4.2.1. Genetic algorithm

(k)

(0)

Genetic algorithm (GA), an evolutionary method, simulates the
biological process of evolution [26]. It starts by creating an initial
population with n individuals (n initial designs assembled in the set
X
). Each individual (AD design in our case) of the population is
analyzed to get its fitness (objective function value). The obtained re-
sults are used to create a new improved generation of individuals
(improved designs assembled in the set X
), which on average is ex-
pected to be better than the previous generation. This improvement is
achieved by simulating evolutionary processes of selection, reproduc-
tion, crossover, and mutation [239]. The selection helps to increase the
overall fitness of the population by choosing the best-suited individuals
and dismissing those exhibiting the lowest fitness values. During
reproduction, chromosomes from best performing individuals are used
to create new individuals by incorporating crossover. To diversify the
genetic pool in this process, mutation is introduced, which aims to
ensure thorough exploration of the whole design space. The flowchart of
a basic GA optimization algorithm is presented in Fig. 19. The conver-
gence or termination criteria can be reached when: (i) the prescribed
maximal number of generations is reached, (ii) the difference between

the best and the worst value of the objective function of the current
generation is equal to or less than a given threshold, (iii) the variation of
individuals from one generation to the next reaches a specified level of
stability, or (iv) when no further improvement can be achieved.

The GA method is very popular and it used the most frequently in AD
optimization [205,212,218,240–242]. The typical design variables are
various AD process parameters [212,240,241] or feed composition [205,
218].

4.2.2. Ant-colony optimization method

Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) is based on the natural behavior of
ants when searching for food [243]. On their way to the food source and
back home they leave a pheromone trail. All ants move with the same
speed and spread the pheromone at the same rate. Since the pheromone
evaporates at a constant rate as well, the shortest pathways will exhibit
the highest concentration of pheromone. This principle of the shortest
pathway is utilized by the ACO method, where the pheromone density is
simulated by an adequate probability distribution [26]. In the ACO
method, the ant is simulated by a simple computational agent that
searches for good solutions to a given optimization problem. For this

34

purpose, the optimization problem needs to be formulated as a problem
of finding the shortest path on a weighted graph.

To solve optimization problems related AD technology, a continuous
ACO method has to be used [244]. To record pheromone information by

,

cording to their corresponding value of the objective function, g0
i = 1...n,j = 1...k. In this way, the position of a particular design in the
archive will always correspond to its rank and the best design will be on
top.

The algorithm of a continuous ACO method is presented in Fig. 20. At
the beginning, a randomly generated design archive is constructed. This
archive is updated at the end of each iteration by adding Na newly
generated designs and removing the same number of worst designs. The

resents the pheromone evaporation intensity.

In the context of AD, Beltramo et al. [218,243] used ACO to identify
the most significant process variables. For this purpose, the accumula-
tion of the pheromone trail was used as a quality feature. From 19 model
parameters in ADM1, the variables selected by ACO were soluble sugar,
soluble amino acids, soluble acetic acid, particulate carbohydrates,
proteins, lipids, and particulate acetic acid [218].

4.2.3. Particle swarm optimization method

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a method inspired by in-
teractions within a bird crowd where the individuals cooperate and
exchange data about the regions they have searched [26,216]. Within
the PSO, the individuals of such swarms are called particles. A particle
can be viewed as a design while its current location is given by design
variable values. To get the optimal design, each ith particle in the swarm
moves towards a combination of its prior personal best position, x*
p,i, and
global best position, x*
g, in the swarm [245]. The personal best position

preserve the previous velocity of the particles during the optimization
process, while r1 and r2 are random vectors, which are uniformly
distributed within the range [0, 1]. The symbols c1 and c2 are the
learning acceleration coefficients, while Δt is the time interval in which
the position and velocity are updated; this parameter is usually
considered equal to 1 [216].

The algorithm of the PSO method is presented in Fig. 21.
Among others, the PSO method was used for AD model calibration
[216,246] as well as for AD process optimization [212,247]. For
example, Zaied et al. [216] used PSO to minimize the error of the ANN
by determining the optimum values for the weights and biases of the
model; the weights and biases were taken as design variables. Further-
more, Casallas-Ojeda et al. [247] used the PSO to maximize BMP of the
AD process of food and garden wastes.

4.2.4. Practical application of stochastic optimization methods in the field
of AD

In Table 12 the most important data of practical applications of the
stochastic optimization methods and their characteristics in the field of
AD technology are collected.

36

From Table 12 one can see that stochastic optimization methods
have been used for ANN model parameters calibration as well as for AD
process optimization. In general, utilization of stochastic optimization
methods increases the probability to find the global optimum, but may
require
if a computationally
substantial
demanding AD model is used.

computational

efforts

Among all the discussed methods, in the field of AD technology GA is
the most frequently used. For example, Kana et al. [242] used an ANN
model coupled with a GA optimization method to optimize the value of
the feedstock composition parameters in order to maximize biogas
production. They demonstrated that AD performance can be notably
improved by finding optimal percentages of banana steam, cow dung,
paper waste, rice bran, and saw dust in the AD feedstock. Barik &
Murugan [240] used the GA to determine optimal values of pH, C/N
ratio, and AD time with the aim to maximize biogas production in case of
using feedstock from seed cake of Karanja and cattle dung. Furthermore,
Huang et al. [241] optimized AD conditions parameters (pH value and
temperature) and feedstock parameters (influent COD, inflow rate) in
order to maximize biogas flowrate and minimize effluent COD by
engaging the GA method and an ANN model for AD performance pre-
diction. Saghouri et al. [205] obtained optimal feedstock composition of
44 % organic municipal solid waste, 24 % cow manure, and 32 %
municipal sewage sludge by using GA optimization; this result was ob-
tained by using either the nonlinear regression or the ANN model for AD
simulation. An ANN model used to predict AD performance and GA
optimization were also engaged to optimize the proportions of

substrates and inoculum in the feedstock in order to maximize biogas
yield [248]; the authors concluded that the proposed mixed anaerobic
consortia could be used quite efficiently as inoculum.

Beltramo et al. [243] used the ADM1 model for data generation,
which in turn was used for machine learning to generate an ANN model
to predict AD performance. In this investigation, the ACO method was
used to identify the most significant process variables in order to
simplify the model dimension and improve prediction performance. The
pheromone concentrations of the process variables (acetic acid, inor-
ganic nitrogen, inert solutes, carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, sugars,
amino and fatty acids) were distributed in the range of 0.69–0.95 units.
In practice, this can reduce the analytical time and costs and can be used
to manage the substrate composition.

To optimize ADM1 model parameters, Bai et al. [246] engaged the
PSO method in order to minimize the differences between numerical and
experimental data. By optimizing the values of ADM1 model parame-
ters, the VFAs concentrations computed at various pH values during the
AD process agreed quite well with the measured values. Based on the
work done, the authors also concluded that alkaline conditions are
beneficial for VFAs production in AD of waste-activated sludge. Zaied
et al. [216] used the PSO method to calibrate ANN model parameters to
predict AD performance when using palm oil mill effluent and cattle
manure as well as additives (hydrogen peroxide and ammonium bicar-
bonate). They concluded that the ANN-PSO model can precisely predict
the AD performance in case of variable feed substrate and additives
concentrations. Casallas-Ojeda et al. [247] demonstrated successful
optimization of feedstock parameters to maximize CH4 yield by using an
ANN model and the PSO method.

Some of the authors used various methods to solve the same opti-
mization problem. For example, Beltramo & Hitzman in Ref. [218] used
GA and ACO methods when considering the concentrations 19 process
variables (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, sugar, amino acids, fatty acids
...). The model dimension was reduced from 19 initial process variables

down to 7 most important when using the ACO method and to only 5
variables when using the GA method. However, both optimization
methods chose concentrations of particulate carbohydrates, proteins,
fats, and soluble acetic acid as the most important process variables for
the prediction of AD performance. Mahata et al. [212] applied the PSO
and GA methods for the same objective function. In case of engaging the
PSO method, the optimal solution was obtained after far less iterations
than in the case of the GA method. As indicated, the possible reason for
this might be that PSO does not comprise highly complex genetic op-
erators such as crossover and mutation, which are present in the GA.

4.3. Advantages and disadvantages of optimization methods

Till today various optimization methods have been used to solve
optimization problems related to AD processes. A comparison of these
methods shows that the deterministic methods are rather rarely engaged
when compared to the stochastic ones. It looks that deterministic opti-
mization methods are favored in combination with mechanistically
inspired AD models (Table 11) while the stochastic methods are used as
a rule in combination with phenomenological AD models (Table 12).
Furthermore, the same method was often used successfully for the
optimization of AD model parameters as well as for AD condition and
feedstock parameters.

As a general principle, gradient-based methods tend to converge
significantly faster on smooth functions when compared to gradient-free
optimization methods. One of the key advantages promoting the choice
of gradient-based methods is their effectiveness in solving optimal
design problems. This is especially true if the design space is large,
meaning that the number of design variables is considerably greater
than the number of constraint and objective functions. On the other
hand, gradient-free optimization methods require no design derivatives
and the objective functions are not required to be smooth. In deter-
ministic optimization, the state and decisions at the present stage

In the context of AD optimization, the most important advantages
and disadvantages of gradient-based deterministic and gradient-free
stochastic methods are summarized in Table 13. Although it is gener-
ally believed that efficient code execution parallelization is only possible
with gradient-free stochastic methods, it has been shown that it is also
possible to implement parallelization in a quite useful and computa-
tionally efficient way with gradient-based methods [15,20].

5. AD products treatment and utilization

The quality and quantity of the obtained AD products impact
significantly their further treatment and their usage. Since AD products
treatment technologies offer additional entry points for introducing
various design variables in advanced optimization scenarios, a brief
overview of biogas and digestate treatments as well as some possible
products utilizations, is given in the following.

5.1. Biogas treatment and utilization

Most biogas utilizations require certain biogas quality levels due to
possible negative impacts of individual biogas components and impu-
rities. For example, H2S and H2O are corrosive; they may cause corro-
sion in compressors, gas storage reservoirs, and engines [255].
Furthermore, due to the presence of H2S during combustion, very toxic
SO2 and SO3 are formed, which are harmful to human health and eco-
systems [256]. In fuel cell applications, even a small amount of H2S
increases the mass transport resistance through the electrodes which is
caused by the sulfur; this may block and deactivate the sites intended for
oxidation [257]. The presence of H2O can also lead to water accumu-
lation in pipes; depending on the circumstances, this water may either
condensate and/or freeze [258]. NH3 is also corrosive and may increase
the NOx emission of a combustion process [255]. CO2 reduces the
calorific value of the biogas and reduces the combustion stability [259].
On the other side, the presence of H2 in the biogas can improve its
combustion characteristics and reduce NOx emissions [259]. Siloxanes,
halogenated and sulfur compounds, dust particles, and other biogas
impurities can cause problems such as damages to equipment of com-
bustion engines, turbines, and boilers [260]. For example, during com-
bustion siloxanes form silicon oxide and microcrystalline quartz deposits
at spark plugs, valves, and cylinder heads, resulting in abrasion, over-
heating, and malfunctioning of engines and valves [261]. In addition,
the presence of siloxanes in biogas may lead to the formation and
deposition of SiO2; this may affect many components in a fuel cell sys-
tem, such as heat exchangers, catalysts, and sensors [262]. Dust particles
present in biogas may form deposits and consequently block nozzles and
fuel cells.

Obviously, biogas components and impurities can be harmful for
biogas conversion devices, human health, and environment [263]. This
necessitates their removal during biogas purification and opens new
opportunities in their further utilization in various applications [264].
For example, the removed CO2 can be used in production of valuable
chemicals (syngas, methanol, dimethyl ether, urea, dimethyl carbonate,

polyurethane, methane, ether, esters, acids, and other), which can be
applied as liquid fuels, fertilizers, and secondary chemicals [265].
Furthermore, high purity CO2 is extensively used in beverage industry in
the production of carbonated drinks. NH3 can be utilized in the fertilizer
industry as a nitrogen source, in the textile industry as a material used to
soften cotton, in antimicrobial drug production, and in production of
nitrogen-containing chemicals [266]. HsS can be used in the production
of sulfuric acid, sodium hydrosulfide, sodium, and inorganic sulfides;
these are needed to manufacture a wide range of consumer goods,
including pesticides, leather, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, dyes,
and heavy water for nuclear power plants [267]. Siloxanes can be used
in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and as anti-foam products due to their
useful properties such as high compressibility, low flammability, low
surface tension and water repelling properties, high thermal stability,
low toxicity, and biodegradability [258].

The biogas quality requirements with respect to the most important
biogas utilizations, which are the most frequently reported [262,265,
268,269], are presented in Fig. 22. The produced raw biogas can be used
directly and without any treatments for cooking and lighting purposes
[264]. Direct combustion of biogas is a simple and low cost technology,
which enables high biogas to heat conversion efficiency [270]. For all
other biogas utilizations, the contents of individual compounds and
impurities are more or less limited [265]. The least strict requirements
are for the usage of biogas in gas turbines, followed by boilers, Stirling
engines, and internal combustion engines. On the other side, biogas used
in natural gas grid injection and fuel cells requires the highest purity and
quality [262,268]. In general, biogas for gas turbines allows for the
highest tolerance capacity of H2S up to 10000 ppm [265]. Siloxane,
especially in micro-turbines, should be removed, and H2O vapor should
be kept at a low levels [262]. For boilers and Stirling engines, the con-
tent of H2S in biogas should be lower than 1000 ppm, while the removal
of CO2 is not required [265,269]. In boilers, the removal of moisture
from biogas is recommended because water may lead to corrosion in the
boiler nozzles. On the other hand, Stirling engines have a high tolerance
for moisture because biogas does not enter the engine cylinders [265].

When biogas is used as fuel in internal combustion engines for vehicles,
the upper limit of H2S content must be in the range of 500–50 ppm,
depending on the type of the engine [265,268]. Furthermore, it is rec-
ommended to remove H2O vapor and siloxane, while the removal of CO2
is not a necessity [265]. The allowed content of H2S in biogas for fuel
cells depends on the type of the fuel cell; the upper limit ranges from 20
ppm for phosphoric acid fuel cell (PA FC), through 10 ppm for molten
carbonate fuel cell (MC FC), to 1 ppm for the solid oxide and proton
exchange membrane fuel cells (SO FC and PEM FC) [268]. Kapoor et al.
[265] reported that moisture and other impurities have to be eliminated
from biogas for fuel cells applications. For the injection into a natural gas
grid, the biogas should be preferable upgraded to biomethane. There-
fore, other biogas components and impurities (foam, dust, siloxanes ...)
should be removed [271]. During the removal of various components

and impurities from raw biogas to get biomethane, the calorific value
increases from 20 MJ m

(cid:0) 3 to 36 MJ m

(cid:0) 3 [270].

To clean and upgrade the raw biogas by removing components and
impurities, various treatment technologies are available. The methods
based on these technologies can be divided either into physicochemical
or biological methods. The most
important biological separation
methods are: (i) biological filtration and (ii) biotrickling filtration [269].
Meanwhile, the most frequently used physicochemical methods are: (i)
physical and chemical absorption (water and amine scrubbing), (ii)
various adsorptions (pressure swing adsorption, adsorption on silica),
(iii) membrane separation, (iv) condensation, and (v) cryogenic sepa-
ration [269]. The selection of the most suitable removal method depends
on the initial concentration of the compound, economic conditions,
operating scale, as well as on the required residual content of the

removed compound [272]. Some characteristics of the most frequently
used biogas treatment technologies for cleaning, upgrading, reforming,
and bioconversion are given in Table 14 [256,262,263,265,271].
Furthermore, the efficiency with respect to the minimal residual content
of the removed compound and the operation cost are also given.

All these technologies can be used either individually or combined
sequentially in dependence on the requirements related to the biogas
quality. It has to be pointed out that these technologies typically require
substantial resources, i.e., energy and materials. Therefore, the decision
for the most appropriate technology will always be influenced by many
variables such as raw biogas quality, locality, technology’s investment
and operational costs, technological needs, and the requirements for
biogas quality.

5.2. Digestate treatment and utilization

Waste pretreatment, feedstock composition, feeding strategy, and
process conditions impact the composition and quality of the anaerobic
digestate to a great extent. Depending on the composition and quality,
digestate can be used for various applications with or without any
further treatments [273–276]. Some of the most frequent digestate
utilizations with some corresponding requirements are presented in
Fig. 23.

The obtained raw digestate, which is conventionally recognized as a
waste, can be legally utilized directly in agriculture and other land ap-
plications, if it meets the legislative requirements and standards [275].
These requirements, which are related to digestate properties (dry
matter, electrical conductivity, bulk density, moisture content), are
prescribed due to possible risks emerging in the digestate handling and
usage. For example, an improper handling and usage of digestate leads
to environmental risks such as leakage of nitrate into soil or water [270]
or nitrogen overload of agricultural land. Furthermore, high concen-
tration of ammonia in the digestate reduces the market value of the
fertilizer [270] and high content of water makes the fertilizer difficult to
handle, transport, and spread in the field [277]. To address these con-
cerns, conserve vulnerable regions, prevent communicable diseases, and
to educate on digestate storage and applications, various digestate
quality and safety standards have been drafted in various countries.
Practically in all these standards, the imposed requirements are related
to stability/maturity, hygiene, pathogens, nutrients, heavy metals, and
other organic/inorganic pollutants [278]. In general, a digestate should
not exceed 0.5 g kg-1 of impurities above 2 mm and can contain a
maximum of two viable seeds per liter of digestate; these requirements
ensure the digestate quality and reduce the injuries risk. In order to
maintain hygiene and prevent health risk, the Salmonella sp. should

practically not be found in a sample of 25 g of fresh digestate and
Escherichia coli should be lower than 1000 CFU g-1. The requirements for
heavy metals (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) as well as the requirements for
total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, magnesium, and ammo-
nium contents vary from country to country [275]. Only if the digestate
fulfills all regulations and standards, it can be used directly as fertilizer,
soil improver, or growing medium [275].

Besides of its direct usage in agricultural and other land applications,
the digestate can be separated into solid and liquid fractions by tech-
nologies such as pressing and thickening (gravity settling, centrifuga-
tion, filtration, air flotation, ...) [273]. The solid and liquid fractions can
be used as a source in various treatment technologies to produce energy
and other value-added products [275,279]. For example, to produce a
compost which provides nutrients to activate plant growth, the solid
digestate is usually used [270,278,280].

Solid digestate properties such as pH value and the presence of
moisture, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients (Mg, Fe, ...), impact the
quality of the obtained compost. This quality can be further improved by
adding various organic materials (woodchips and green waste) in
various composting processes [270]. The solid digestate can also be used
in various types of pyrolysis (slow, fast, microwave, catalyst pyrolysis
...) to produce bio-char, bio-oil, and syngas; the proportions of these
products depend on the digestate composition, pyrolysis type, and
process conditions. Pyrolysis products can be used for various applica-
tions in heating, power generation, extraction of chemicals, and trans-
portation fuels. Bio-char can be further used as adsorbent for heavy
metals and antibiotics removal [281]. Bio-oil, which contains acids,
aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, furans, sugars, and phenolics, can be
further treated in order to reach the standard of petroleum-based liquid
fuels. Syngas, which consists of C-, N-, and S-containing groups [276],
can also be utilized as fuel after appropriate treatments [276,281].
N-containing groups promote the formation of NOx photochemical
smog. During the combustion process of syngas, the S-containing groups
H2S and SO2 can be converted into SOx, which form photochemical
smog and acid rain pollution. C-containing groups represent combus-
tible gases CO and CH4, which can be used to generate heat and elec-
tricity. Bio-char and syngas can be produced from solid digestate by
gasification. The solid digestate, which contains a high quantity of un-
digested cell wall polymers, is suitable to produce bioethanol by using
fermentation [278].

Beside solid digestate, the liquid digestate is also suitable to produce
biofuels. In this context, the lipids from the liquid digestate can be
converted into biodiesel via the transesterification process and produce
glycerol as a byproduct [270]. To produce a fertilizer, the nutrients can
be recovered from liquid digestate; the nitrogen can be recovered as

41

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101199

ammonium sulfate and phosphorus can be recovered as struvite, Ca/Mg,
or Mg/P precipitate [282]. For this purpose, the concentration of ni-
(cid:0) 1, the alkalinity
trogen in digestate should be higher than 500 mg L
(cid:0) 1, while the
(concentration of CaCO3) should be higher than 4000 mg L
N/P, Ca/P, and Mg/P molar ratios are recommended to be above 1.0
[282].

The feasibility of nutrient recovery depends not only on the digestate
composition, but also on the engaged digestate treatment technologies.
The most frequently used treatment technologies for nutrient recovery
are struvite precipitation, calcium phosphate precipitation, and strip-
ping, while membrane separations are frequently combined with other
technologies to enhance the nutrient recovery [275]. A digestate, which
is rich in active anaerobic microbes, nutrients, and undegraded organic

matter, can be recirculated in the AD bioreactor to produce methane. In
doing so, it has to be kept in mind that a digestate typically includes
heavy metals and other compounds that have inhibitory effects on the
AD process [280]. For this reason, before being recirculated in the
bioreactor, the digestate has to be treated accordingly. For example,
after adequate removal of ammonia, heavy metals, and pathogens, the
recirculated liquid digestate can improve the AD process stability and
enhance methane production [278,283]. The liquid digestate can also be
used to produce freshwater by using adequate membrane processes
(ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, ...) [278].

In order to fulfill the regulations and standards for safe digestate land
disposal and to increase solid and liquid digestate utilization, various
treatment technologies are currently available. For the solid-liquid

digestate separation one can use drying, screw press separation, strip-

separation, various valorization technologies can be used. Among those,
the most important solid digestate valorization technologies are: (i)
composting, (ii) gasification, (iii) hydrothermal carbonization, (iv) py-
rolysis, and (v) fibers fermentation. The most important liquid digestate

depends on the digestate composition and on the required end products.
Some important characteristics of the most frequently used solid and
liquid digestate treatments technologies, which enable various high
value digestate products, are given in Table 15 [7,274,284,285].

6. Current challenges and future research directions

Further advances in AD technologies will surely require improve-
ments in AD process modeling and optimization techniques. The main
challenges expected in this quest can be classified into five main groups:
(i) availability of experimental data, (ii) advanced modeling of the AD
process, (iii) balance between simplicity and complexity of the AD
model, (iv) numerical stability and efficiency of AD process simulations,
and (v) AD optimization strategies to ensure environmentally friendly
processing and utilization of AD products.

6.1. Availability of experimental data

Due to AD process complexity, detailed and reliable experimental

data is of outmost importance to ensure progress in AD model devel-
opment and calibration/training. Moreover, due to the large number
and diversity of AD input parameters, very large amount of such data
would be needed. Unfortunately, the data provided in the publications
related to AD modeling are often not detailed enough and incomplete,
which makes the situation extremely inconvenient.

As the complexity of AD modeling increases, more detailed charac-
terization of feeding substrate and microbial community and more data
related to AD process conditions and AD performance are needed. The
determination of the composition as well as the physical and chemical
properties of each of the feeding substrates as well as the complex
substrate and microbial community characteristics is not an easy task.
Although the methods for characterization of microbes and substrates
are fairly well known, proper data required for numerical simulations
are often difficult to obtain. For example, most studies on AD microbiota
have focused mainly on the comparison of relative abundance of 16S
rRNA gene metataxonomics on lab-scale bioreactors [297,298]. The
microbial dynamics in response to operational parameters assessed
through lab-scale studies are not directly reflected in full-scale bio-
reactors due to differences in volumes, operational conditions, feeding
strategy, mixing, and substrate heterogeneity. Although efforts have
been made to profile the microbiota of full-scale biogas plants by using
very promising marker gene-based metataxonomics, the available data
are still insufficient [297]. Furthermore, there is a still absence of
experimental data related to fluctuations in the biochemical and phys-
icochemical properties of the influent feedstock from the same source
[3]. It is known that these properties of a particular substrate from the
same source may also be highly variable. For example, the lignocellu-
losic properties vary with respect the geographical location, biomass
maturation, and harvest periods. Animal manure properties vary with

animal food, environment and animal age, while food and municipal
wastes properties vary with seasonal, regional and other factors.
Furthermore, the application of various waste pretreatment methods
can also contribute to changes in feedstock properties. Due to the fact
that physical and biochemical characteristics of various feedstock types
play a critical role in preventing process instability and optimizing the
AD system, attention should be focused on feedstock evaluation and
monitoring during the daily management of full-scale biogas plants.

To study the basic influences of various physical and biochemical
feedstock characteristics on the AD process by utilizing numerical
modeling and optimization, a wide availability of a comprehensive data
bank of various substrates and microbial community characteristics
would be very helpful. Furthermore, daily monitoring of substrate
properties, feeding strategy, AD operational parameters, and AD per-
formance in real biogas plants is becoming ever more indispensable to
assure further development of AD modeling and optimization.

6.2. Advanced modeling of the AD processes

Some phenomena taking place in the bioreactor during anaerobic
digestion are relatively rarely and rather incompletely included into the
modeling of the AD process. Two of such most exposed phenomena are
the foaming process and the sophisticated activities of a high diversity
microbial community [299,300].

6.2.1. Foaming considerations

In an AD bioreactor, foaming represents a problem that affects the
efficiency and stability of the AD process. It can be caused by several
factors, which include AD process parameters (temperature, mixing in-
tensity, OLR),
feeding
strategy, additives, viscosity, and surface tension), metabolites – in-
termediates and products of metabolism, bioreactor configuration pa-
rameters, and microbial parameters [300]. Furthermore, Subramanian

feeding parameters (substrate composition,

& Pagilla [301] discussed the role of mixing in foam formation. Mixing
creates favorable conditions for AD foaming by entrapping bubbles into
which the formed gas can diffuse and by providing the necessary free
energy which lowers the energy barrier and may thus lead to a rapid rise
in the headspace volume due to foam. Additionally, incomplete degra-
dation of excess organic compounds leads to accumulation of hydro-
phobic or surface-active products, which may significantly promote
foaming [300,302–304]. As Duan et al. [302] reported, foaming may
also be to a great extent related to the abundance of specific bacteria.

To some degree, the problems related to foaming can be reduced by
engaging advanced modeling and numerical simulation in order to study
the mechanisms of the foam formation as well as the most important
parameters which induce foaming. For example, a study of bubble
growth dynamics can help to identify such influencing parameters.
Bubbles nucleation and growth in a bioreactor during the AD process as
well as the stability of the foam layer can be estimated by CFD modeling
by considering non-Newtonian fluids and appropriate mass, momentum
and diffusion equations [300,301]. Furthermore, the usage of various
AD phenomenological models (black box models) could also help to
identify foaming parameters and predict foaming in a relatively simple
and efficient way. Some authors tried to address foaming by utilizing
mechanistically inspired AD models. For example, Dalmau et al. [305]
developed a risk model for foaming simulation, which includes four
steps: knowledge acquisition, selection of key variables, implementa-
tion, and simulation. The aim of this risk model is not to diagnose
operational problems of microbiological origin with absolute certainty.
Instead, it is aimed at quantifying whether the simulated control stra-
tegies pose a severe risk for leading the system towards operational
problems.

Unfortunately, till today no universally recognized foaming mecha-
nism is available, that would describe comprehensively the situation in
any particular AD bioreactor [300]. This is because there is still a lack of
fundamental understanding of the correlations of foaming with the AD

44

process, feeding, bioreactor configuration parameters, and microbial
community [304]. Furthermore, the foaming influencing parameters
have no consistent quantitative relationship to the foaming process.

The microbes are the main functional body ensuring AD perfor-
mance, which is why the foaming mechanisms should probably be
explored at microbial community level [300,302–304]. Since the mi-
crobes are characterized by high diversity and the same microbial types
may have different functions under different environmental conditions,
this represents a significant challenge.

6.2.2. Microbial community considerations

Many microbial groups are typically involved in various steps of the
AD process as they interact in biochemical reactions to form various
metabolites. Microbial diversity in a bioreactor depends mainly on the
substrate type and composition, inoculum, and biological additives.
Meanwhile, microbial growth and activity depend on temperature, pH
value, primary and secondary metabolites concentrations, moisture
content, mixing intensity, OLR, HRT, and digester design. Current in-
vestigations of microbiological activities in the AD process show [44,
303] that various microbial domains (bacteria, fungi, and archaea) are
involved in hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis.
For example, over 40 bacteria genus (Anaerosphaera, Bacteroides, Clos-
tridium, Bacillus, Thermotoga, Campylobacter ...) and fungy genus
(Aspergillus, Humicola, Penicillium, Trichodema ...) are involved in the
AD hydrolysis and acidogenic steps. Acetogens, including various bac-
teria genera (Acetobacterium, Clostridium, Desulfotignum, Eubacterium,
Moorella, Ruminococcus, Thermoanaerobacter) can convert products ob-
tained from acidogenic phase into acetic acid, CO2, and H2, while the
archaea genus (Methanobacterium, Methanobrevibacter, Methanococcus,
Methanoculleus, Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobium, thanosarcina, Meth-
anospirillum, Methanothermobacter) are the most important microbes
involved in the methanogenesis step. For 153 species of methanogenic
archaea, the data of optimal growth temperature and pH value were
already successfully collected [303,306]. Unfortunately, these data are
not easily available for other involved microbial species. Moreover,
some other characteristics of microbes (maximal microbial growth rate
at optimal temperature, inhibitions, microbial growth rate, and Monod
saturation constants ...), which are crucial for advanced AD process
modeling, are not easily available.

Since all species involved in the AD process are not known and
identified completely, current complex mechanistically inspired AD
models consider only the main microbial groups belonging to acidogens,
acetogens, and methanogens [15,18,20,33]. Furthermore, in all these
AD models the initial concentrations of each microbial groups are usu-
ally unknown and have to be either estimated [33,43,44,114] or cali-
brated with respect to experimental AD performance data [15,20,116].
Since the microbial community plays the most important role in biogas
production, precise prediction, process monitoring, real-time control-
ling, and modeling of microbial communities’ performance are among
the most promising directions for improving AD process modeling and
optimization. In this context, the mathematical relations between AD
performances and each microbial species activity as well as identifica-
tion of the mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of inhibitory
compounds under various conditions should be much more thoroughly
investigated in the future.

6.3. Balance between simplicity and complexity of AD models

Maintaining an adequate balance between simplicity and complexity
of AD models is not trivial and so it may be worth taking a brief look at
the most important challenges related to this topic. In this context, AD
model parameters calibration, which is especially problematic for
complex mechanistically inspired AD models, is discussed first. After
that, some discussion is devoted to the consideration of change in
rheological properties of the substrate in CFD-enhanced mechanistically
inspired models. Finally, the underfitting and overfitting of the kinetic

and phenomenological AD models is addressed briefly.

6.3.1. Calibration of AD model parameters

More complex mechanistically inspired AD models contain many
parameters, which are practically unknown or hardly determined by
experiments. Good examples of such model parameters are dissociation
equilibrium constants, microbial growth rates, liquid-gas transfer co-
efficients, Henry’s law coefficients, solubility product constants, among
others. Since the actual number of these parameters may quickly
become a few hundred, their calibration is not an easy task.

To solve this problem, an appropriate calibration approach is
needed. So far, the most frequently used approach was to calibrate only
a small set of the most important parameters. These parameters are
selected based on their relative influence on the AD process, obtained
either by an adequate sensitivity analysis (SA) or some other approach
[15,20,44,112,114,115,234,307]. By using a local version of the SA, the
values of only one or few parameters are changed in order to evaluate
their effects on the AD performance. In contrast, a global SA tries to
estimate the importance of various model parameters when they interact
across the full problem space. For example, Fatolahi et al. [114] utilized
the local approach by changing the value of one parameter while
keeping other parameters constant; they performed the SA with the
Shannon entropy concept which resulted in 13 important model pa-
rameters of the AD process; to optimize these parameters, the GA
method was used. Ozgun et al. [308] determined the values of 8 AD
model parameters by utilizing an adequate SA and the trial and
correction technique. A similar approach was adopted by Odriozola
et al. [307] by using the Monte Carlo (MC) method. Zhao et al. [115]
used the SA to identify and evaluate five the most sensitive kinetic pa-
rameters during biogas production. Furthermore, Kovalovszki et al.
[112] reduced the number of the most important model parameters from
44 to 13 by using a SA coupled with the Latin Hypercube Sampling and
the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient methods. Ge et al. [309] used
the SVM model to determine seven ADM1 model parameters with
respect to C, H, O, N, S contents and digestion temperature; 7 parameters
with the highest sensitivities were selected from 17 ADM1 kinetic pa-
rameters. In the last years, two general applicable SA-based procedures
for calibration of a large number of model parameters were proposed.
These two procedures, shown in Fig. 24, are: (i) the hierarchical and
sequential single-parameter optimization (HSSPO) [234] and (ii) the
active set optimization (ASO) procedure [15,20].

In HSSPO the hierarchy processing is driven by SA and starts with an
initial elimination of the most insensitive parameters; their values are
fixed to the values proposed in the literature. The remaining parameters
undergo a quantitative evaluation of their relative impact on the process
outputs and an evaluation of their impact ubiquity across various model
outputs. This HSSPO procedure delivers a single measure of parameter
importance used for the hierarchy that defines the sequence of single
parameter optimizations. It has to be noted that in HSSPO once a
parameter is optimized and eliminated from the active set, its value
remains constant and can not affect further optimization process. In
contrast, the interactions of all parameters from the parameter set are
taken into account in the final stages of the ASO procedure. This pro-
cedure starts with a relatively small set of the most influencing param-
eters and ends with all model parameters being active in the final stages
of the procedure. The active design variables are selected on the basis of
SA, where the most important model parameters are determined with
respect to the analysis of variance of absolute average values of objective
function derivatives with respect to design variables. By coupling the SA
with the optimal design procedure, the model parameters are gradually
activated to act as current design variables until all model parameters
are active. In this procedure, the optimized values of the parameters
being active in the previous stage are used as the initial values for the
next stage with an increased set of active parameters. In this way, the
ASO procedure mitigates the dependence of the optimized values of the
model parameters on their initial values; the procedure is not very

45

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101199

complicated and exhibits rather good stability and efficiency.

Regarding future development, there is one issue that seems to
deserve special attention. When running calibration procedures with a
large set of AD parameters in various scenarios, the results indicate that
there may well exist certain either stronger or looser dependencies be-
tween several model parameters. Such dependencies always make the
calibration procedure more difficult and they increase the diversity of
possible solutions. So, getting more insight into such potential de-
pendencies, either by experimental or numerical procedures, would
surely prove beneficial for the understanding of the AD process.
Furthermore, this would obviously reduce the number of model pa-
rameters and make the calibration procedures more reliable and
efficient.

6.3.2. Changes in rheological properties of the substrate

Currently, CFD-enhanced mechanistically inspired modeling is still
accompanied by serious challenges. One of them is accurate determi-
nation of instantaneous physical properties of the substrate, i.e., the
content of the bioreactor, during the AD process. Substrates with low
content of TS, especially at higher temperatures, are more likely to
behave as a Newtonian fluid, while in case of a high TS share the fluid
behavior is non-Newtonian [21]. Currently, it is still not clear whether
the rheological properties like viscosity of the fluid substrate affect the
flow state in a bioreactor in a way that would significantly impact the
bioreactor outputs. In this context, it is also not clear whether the sub-
strate fluid should be treated as a Newtonian or as a non-Newtonian
fluid [310]. What is clear is that these properties may change during
the AD process in dependence on many parameters, including the
feeding strategy. Since
considered in
CDF-enhanced mechanistically inspired models, these models have the
potential to deliver accurate AD process simulations under various
mixing conditions. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to verify experi-
mentally the results obtained with such models, especially for a wide
range of circumstances in large-scale biogas plants. Furthermore, CFD
simulation of an AD process in a large and complex bioreactor requires
an extremely high computational effort; consequently, the building of
the grid model and grid density often have to adjusted to keep the
computer performance within acceptable limits.

should be

these

facts

It has to be noted that the mentioned challenges would only need to
be addressed if all biochemical, chemical, and physicochemical re-
actions of the AD process have to be considered in the CFD-enhanced
model. Till today, this was not the case since only some of the
biochemical reactions of elementary AD models have so far been linked
to or integrated into a CFD model [135,142]. For example, Rezavand
et al. [142] proposed a direct link between the biochemical and mixing
processes. Tobo et al. [135] integrated the hydrolysis and biomass
growth equations of an elementary AD model into CFD by utilizing
user-defined functions. However, a proper coupling between an
elementary AD model, which includes biochemical, chemical, and
physicochemical reactions, and a CFD model, would require to address
modeling issues that till now were neither widely investigated nor
solved.

6.3.3. Underfitting and overfitting

The efficiency of a ML-based solution depends on the nature and
characteristics of the data and the performance of the learning methods.
ML model training and validation require a large amount of data and if
these are insufficient, particularly for high-dimensional data-sets,
overfitting and low training efficiency will occur [208]. Note that the
selection of a proper ML method suitable for AD application is still a
challenge. Namely, the selection of a wrong ML method would result in a
model producing unexpected outcomes, which would make the model
practically worthless. When it comes to accuracy of an ML method, it is
important to understand the prediction errors - bias and variance. Bias is
an error resulting from erroneous assumptions in the ML method. High
bias (low complexity) can cause a method to miss the relevant relations

between features and target outputs (underfitting). On the other hand,
variance is an error resulting from the sensitivity to small fluctuations in
the training set. High variance (high complexity) can cause a method to
model the random noise in the training data, rather than the intended
outputs (overfitting). This bias-variance dilemma results from trying to
simultaneously minimize these two sources of error that prevent su-
pervised ML methods from potentially allowing to be generalized
beyond their training set.

Keeping this in mind, it seems that in AD performance prediction
simple ML models tend to be preferable compared to more complex ML
models. Namely, a simple ML model can: (i) prevent overfitting since it
suppresses the capturing of random effects; (ii) enable better interpret-
ability since a complex model can be hard to interpret, especially, when
features are correlated with each other; and (iii) increase computational
efficiency since a simple model trained on a low-dimensional dataset is
computationally very efficient. Despite that, the increasing demands of
prediction accuracy will inevitably reflect in increasing complexities of
new models. In this context, preventing overfitting, minimizing data
bias, and increasing rigor and reproducibility will probably be the major
challenges in creating new ML models for AD systems.

6.4. Stability and efficiency of AD process simulation

Stability and efficiency of numerical simulation of the AD processes
is affected by many factors, two of which seems to be particularly
important. The first one is related to the stiffness of the ODEs arising in
mechanistically inspired AD models and the other one is related to the
choice of the initialization scheme engaged in kinetic and phenomeno-
logical AD models.

6.4.1. Stiffness of mechanistically inspired AD model equations

Mechanistically inspired AD models rely on equations describing the
intertwined chemical, biochemical, and physicochemical processes.
Since these processes are complicated and take place on quite different
time scales, this inherently results in a rather stiff system of ODEs. A stiff
system raises problems related to numerical stability and accuracy of the
solution process and makes the numerical simulation of the AD process
somewhat challenging [20,46,142,311]. Consequently, the usage of
explicit solvers necessitates very short time steps and makes the inte-
gration computationally intensive. On the other hand, although some
implicit solvers can be used for stiff ODEs, such solvers can also become
inherently slow and unstable in simulation of AD processes [36].
Therefore, the origins of stiffness and the possibilities to reduce it in AD
modeling have already been investigated in more detail. It was found
out that one of the main reasons are the substantially different conver-
sion rates in various reactions (i.e. where the range of time constants is
large) [142,311]. Batstone et al. [36] argued that the rapid processes
control the step length and numerical solution stability, while the slow
processes determine the dynamic behavior. Therefore, to reduce the
stiffness of the model, attention should be focused on the reactions with
substantially different speeds [36]. Chemical reactions, such are
acid-base, complexation, and other ion pairing reactions, are faster than
physicochemical and biochemical reactions. For slower, bio-chemical
and physicochemical reactions, the ODEs must be used because we are
interested in the time-variable or dynamic variation of the constituents.
On the other hand, for fast chemical reactions, the steady-state solutions
are perfectly adequate and a thermodynamic equilibrium approach may
be applied [27,36]. For this reason, to determine ionic species concen-
trations in the bioreactor, a system of AEs can be used [20,48]. In this
case, the concentration of hydrogen ions H
, and consequently the pH

centration of cationic species with ion charge s, while ncat and nan denote
the total number of considered cationic and anionic species. In most
investigations, the pH value is determined by an iterative procedure
which tends to be much more time consuming than engaging ODEs [42,
158,237]. This makes the simulation of such a system challenging, and
so, in order to avoid excessively long simulation times, one needs to be
somewhat creative when implementing the model. One such solution is
given in Ref. [20], where the iterative determination of pH value is

as the underlying ODE.
Both approaches of handling the concentration of ionic species and
the pH value, discussed in the foregoing text, have already been used
within a quite complex AD model [20]. The results were quite promising
in the context of making the simulation of AD processes more stable and
efficient. Thus, similar approaches in this direction might be worth
further investigations in the future.

6.4.2. Choice of initialization scheme in ML modeling

The choice of initialization scheme plays a significant role in ML
modeling and it can be crucial for maintaining numerical stability. A
proper initialization scheme can reduce the computation time and
improve the convergence speed of training. The choice of the initiali-
zation scheme is closely related to the choice of the activation function,
where it is crucial to initialize the bias and weights appropriately to
ensure a ML model with high accuracy.

Although several architecture-specific initialization schemes have
already been proposed, these schemes are not always portable to new
architectures emerging in modeling of AD processes in various biogas
plants. Therefore, for stable and efficient ML modeling of the AD pro-
cess, attention should be focused on the development of the most suit-
able initialization scheme with all corresponding ML parameters.

6.5. Advanced optimization of the AD processes

To calibrate AD model parameters with respect to the experimentally
obtained AD performance and to improve AD performance, various
optimization techniques were developed and quite successfully used so
far. Unfortunately, a fair comparison of various deterministic and sto-
chastic optimization methods used to improve the same AD process is
still missing. Consequently, a critical evaluation of efficiency of these
methods applied in AD optimization is currently practically not possible.
Apart of the engaged optimization method, there is still a dilemma of
optimization targeting, like for example, more biogas of low quality or
less biogas of high quality. Such decisions are reflected in the definition
of design variables, objective function, and constraints. Note however,
that such decisions depend heavily on many factors, including the
further usage of the produced biogas and digestate (Section 5). For
example, to apply biogas as fuel in internal combustion engines, the H2S
content has to be strongly limited. To avoid or minimize later H2S
removal from biogas, the AD process should be optimized in such a way,
that the production of H2S during the AD process will be minimal. For
this reason, the permitted H2S formation and its content in biogas can be
limited or minimized by proper selection of design variables and
adequate definition objective and constraint functions. In this way, the
processing time and cost for H2S removal from biogas can potentially be
reduced significantly.

Finally, one should be noted that to achieve significant overall
progress, the AD optimization problem should be defined with respect to
a very complex background of circular economy from the technical,
ecological, and economical aspects. This is a sophisticated challenge,

47

since the problem formulation should incorporate waste pretreatment,
AD process, further treatments of AD products, and requirements of AD
products with respect to their utilization. Such complex optimization
tasks would require the technical, ecological, and economical knowl-
edge of waste pretreatment methods, AD process, AD products treat-
ments, and AD products utilizations. What looks particularly difficult in
this context is that this would necessitate the integration of additional
sophisticated numerical models, related to these technologies, into a
much more complex and comprehensive AD optimization model. Note
that to achieve maximal optimization effectiveness, these models would
need to incorporate not only the technical, but also economical and
environmental aspects.

In such a complex situation, the pool of AD key parameters would
even be extended beyond the one summarized in Section 2.2 and Section
5. This would open up further opportunities to introduce many new
influential design variables of very diverse types. Formulating an effi-
cient and useful optimization problem in such a scenario will represent a
huge challenge by itself, while another big challenge will be how to
drive the solution process in such a way that valuable and practically
useable results will be obtained.

7. Concluding remarks

As our requirements for AD performance increase, so do also the
requirements for the reliability, accuracy, and skillful utilization of
various AD models. In order to achieve further progress in refining and
improving the AD process by increasingly more detailed optimization of
its various stages, the mechanistically inspired mathematical models
seems to offer the most important fundament. As it currently stands, it
looks that further improvements in these models would require to
address the following topics:

• Consideration of instantaneous composition and properties of each
involved substrate. This would improve the prediction of AD per-
formance drastically by considering the variation in the content of
macro-, micro-, and nano-compounds as well as in the microbial
community composition. Furthermore, this would provide more
insight into the correlation between pretreatment methods and
process stability at the industrial level.

• Accurate estimate/computation of many involved model parameters,
such are biochemical, kinetic, and stoichiometric model parameters
(dissociation equilibrium constants, microbial growth rates, liquid-
gas transfer coefficients, Henry’s law coefficients, solubility prod-
uct constants, and others). The quality of final calibration of these
model parameters can be improved by performing systematic real
time measurements of various AD performances (biogas and its
compositions, concentrations of all compounds in liquid phase,
concentrations of precipitates, ...) and various AD operating condi-
tions parameters (temperature, pH, ...)

• Further investigations of mathematical relations between AD per-
formance and microbial diversity and activity. This includes research
needed to identify the mechanisms responsible for the accumulation
of inhibitory compounds under various conditions with particular
focus on linking the microbial community structure and function to
the AD operation.

• Modeling of the AD process linked directly to further processing of
the obtained AD digestate. This would include determination of
digestate quality and composition, adsorption of heavy metals from
liquid digestate by using appropriate nanomaterials, and elimination
of toxic components from solid digestate in order to enable its usage
as a fertilizer.

• Modeling of the AD process linked directly to electricity production
in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). This includes investigations of MFC
design (anaerobic chamber, aerobic chamber, membranes, elec-
trodes, ...), types of substrates, additives (conductive materials, pili,
cytochromes, ...), microbial
transfer

mechanisms (IIET, DIET), and appropriate modeling of all processes
in MFC systems (biochemical, chemical, physicochemical, electro-
chemical, and electrical processes).

• Incorporation of complex AD models into CFD. Firstly, this would
enable modeling of foaming phenomena by using the governing
partial differential equations; this requires knowledge of the micro-
bial structure of the influent substrates and mixture in the bioreactor
as well as the spatial description of the digester. Secondly, CFD
implementation offers the possibility further investigations of heat
transfer and the potential formation of temperature gradients inside
the bioreactor. This is important in the case of a thermophilic AD
process, where temperature becomes more relevant in the descrip-
tion of the fluid regime since temperature affects the mixture density
and viscosity. Thirdly, CFD would enable optimization of the mixing
process by adequate modeling of the molecular and turbulent
diffusion transports, which contribute significantly to the homoge-
nization of the substrates and biomass in the AD process.

Such complex optimization tasks may require skillful utilization of
both, deterministic and stochastic, optimization methods. In this way
the AD process conditions, feedstock loading rate, complex substrate
composition, pretreatments, and bioreactor configuration can be opti-
mized simultaneously in order to produce maximum volumes of CH4
and other valuable products with minimized harmful environmental
effects and costs. To determine the optimal bioreactor configuration,
special attention should be focused on the mixing process and heat
losses. By optimizing mixing of the content inside the bioreactor, one
can ensure efficient transfer of organic material for the active microbial
biomass, release of the gas bubbles trapped in the medium, and prevent
the sedimentation of denser particulate material. To increase the CH4
production, adequate chemicals and temperature for thermochemical
pre-treatment as well as the conditions for ultrasonic pre-treatment
should be optimized. Furthermore, to enhance the production rate and
biogas composition by additives, the optimal type, size, and dosage of
nanomaterials, should be searched for.

Some phenomena occurring in AD are extremely complex and still
insufficient investigated, which makes them very difficult to incorporate
into mechanistically inspired models. This is where kinetic and
phenomenological models may prove to be very useful and makes their
further development reasonable. In this context, perhaps the most
valuable topics worth further investigation are as follows:

• Effective systematic AD process data collection and processing with
the aim to ensure the needed volume and quality of AD process data.
Only sufficient quantities of relevant, representative and, high-
quality data may lead to accurate and efficient and ML models.
• Development of systematic procedures to overcome data scarcity by:
(i) extracting additional data from previously published literature;
(ii) performing design of experiments in order to improve ML effi-
ciency without increasing the sample size; (iii) developing new ML-
based methods which can be efficiently applied to small datasets.
• Development of systematic procedures to categorize and interpret
the contribution of many diverse input variables (features) to ML
models.

• Evaluation of the risk of foaming in a bioreactor during the AD
process under various operating conditions, various feeding sub-
strates, and various feeding strategies.

The research efforts should be directed towards enabling a symbiotic
interaction between mechanistically inspired, kinetic, and phenome-
nological modeling of the AD process. More generally, ML research
could be harnessed to overcome the current scalability limitations of
mechanistically inspired modelling, while mechanistically inspired
models could be used by machine learning methods both as transient
inputs and as a validating framework.

As the AD modeling is enhanced and refined, the advances poten-
tially offered by increasingly complex multi-objective optimization
strategies of the AD process become ever more attainable and promising.
In this context, special attention should be focused on the following is-
sues:

• Optimization of AD feedstock and AD process conditions (OLR, HRT,
temperature, pH value) in order to improve biogas quantity and
quality as well as digestate quality simultaneously; the quality of the
produced digestate, potentially useable as a fertilizer, depends on the
availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

• Optimization of waste pretreatment methods and improvement of

the AD process stability.

• Optimization of combined AD-related processes as a single process,
for example, a combination of the pre-treatment processes of sub-
strates, AD process, addition of biological and inorganic additives,
mixing processes in the bioreactor, and posttreatment of AD
products.
