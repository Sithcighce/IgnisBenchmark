Hydrogen is a key pillar in the global Net Zero strategy. Rapid scaling up of hydrogen production, transport,
distribution and utilization is expected. This entails that hydrogen, which is traditionally an industrial gas,
will come into proximity of populated urban areas and in some situations handled by the untrained public.
To realize all their benefits, hydrogen and its technologies must be safely developed and deployed. The
specific properties of hydrogen involving wide flammability range, low ignition energy and fast flame speed
implies that any accidental release of hydrogen can be easily ignited. Comparing with conventional fuels,
combustion systems fueled by hydrogen are also more prone to flame instability and abnormal combustion.
This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review about combustion research related to hydrogen safety. It
starts with a brief introduction which includes some overview about risk analysis, codes and standards. The
core content covers ignition, fire, explosions and deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). Considering that
DDT leads to detonation, and that detonation may also be induced directly under special circumstances, the
subject of detonation is also included for completeness. The review covers laboratory, medium and large-scale
experiments, as well as theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results. While highlights are provided
at the end of each section, the paper closes with some concluding remarks highlighting the achievements and
key knowledge gaps.

1. Introduction

1.1. General context

The combustion of fossil fuels, i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal, ac-
counts for more While fossil fuels constitute a well-known and practical
source of energy, their reserves are limited [1] and their utilization gen-
erates multi-scale pollution. At a local scale, their combustion directly
and indirectly produces various pollutants which affect local air qual-
ity and create pollution peak episodes under specific conditions [2].
Among others, these pollutants can include nitrogen and sulfur oxides,
carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, various volatile organic
compounds, and soot, which are primary pollutants [3] and secondary
pollutants including ozone [4] and peroxy acetyl nitrate [5]. All these
pollutants are harmful to humans and have dramatic consequences on
public health At a global scale, the combustion of fossil fuels generates
large amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) which cause climate change
with an increase of the average temperature on Earth and changes of
the composition and the dynamics of the atmosphere [2,6].

To mitigate the issues related to the extensive utilization of fossil
fuels, a rapid transition toward a sustainable and environmentally
friendly system of energy production is of the utmost importance.
Alternative renewable sources of energy include solar, wind, biomass,
geothermal, hydro, and tidal energies [7]. The implementation of re-
newable energy sources (RES) as replacements for fossil fuels is a
key step toward the creation of a carbon-neutral society. Energy stor-
age has an essential role to play in the energetic transition due to
the intermittency of RES [8]. Indeed, some of the RES, in particular
solar photovoltaics and wind turbines, are intrinsically intermittent,
so that energy storage solutions are required to transiently match
electricity supply with demand and take advantage of off-peak energy
production [9]. While many approaches can be employed, including
mechanical, potential energy, and electrochemical, the most promising
approach for long term storage of large quantity of energy is chem-
ical energy storage [9]. Two promising carbon-free chemical energy
carriers are hydrogen and ammonia; both fuels present a number of
advantages and challenges. The present review focuses on the safety
aspects of hydrogen. The economics, and technical aspects associated
with ammonia utilization as an energy carrier will not be discussed
further. The interested reader is invited to consult the related recent
reviews on this topic [7,9,10].

Hydrogen is fast evolving as an important energy carrier with wide
range of applications as fuel for on-road, marine, and aviation applica-
tions, as storage media for electricity generated by wind turbines [11];
and as an energy source for heating in both commercial [12] and
household applications, i.e., cooking and heating [13]. A hypothetical
study based on assumption of complete transition of German trans-
ports from conventional fuel- to hydrogen-powered predicted that the
later could contribute significantly to climate and air quality goals.
Nevertheless, hydrogen utilization also presents several challenges. The
low volumetric energy density of hydrogen complicates its utilization
in the transportation sector. The storage of hydrogen can be techni-
cally challenging, expansive, and potentially not very efficient [9].
Energy production in engines and gas turbines using the combustion
of hydrogen–air mixtures is also challenging. In particular, the thermo-
diffusive instabilities observed during the combustion of lean mixtures
require engineering solutions to mitigate unstable combustion, blow-
off, noise, and flash-back [14]. In other words, hydrogen is not a
drop-in replacement fuel with existing technologies and infrastructure,
and a transition to hydrogen as a primary energy carrier poses a number
of technical challenges. Despite such challenges, industrial solutions
have been developed to use pure hydrogen in gas turbines [15]. In
addition, the development of several other promising applications, such
as mild/flameless combustion of hydrogen-based mixtures [16], paves
the way toward a wide-spread utilization of hydrogen as a fuel.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

As with all fuels and energy carriers, there are risks and safety
issues with hydrogen. On behalf of the European Hydrogen Safety
Panel established by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, Wen et al. [14]
analyzed the 706 events that were, as of May 2021, in the European
Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database (HIAD 2.0), a public repos-
itory archiving data on incidents and near-misses involving hydrogen.
Fig. 1 shows the percentages of events initiated by hydrogen or non-
hydrogen systems (outer circle) and the different consequences of the
incidents (the inner circle). In most events, i.e., 75%, initiation was
related to hydrogen systems. The releases remained un-ignited in 15%
of the cases, and 6% were near-misses. Hydrogen got ignited in 79%
of the events, including 48% of cases which involve explosions. In
addition to HIAD 2.0, H2Tools [17], which was developed by the
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory through support from the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy (EERE), also contains an accidents database which collects
descriptions about over 200 hydrogen incidents. In addition, H2Tools
provides easily accessible information on hydrogen safety.

Hydrogen, with a very large mass diffusivity and low molecular
weight, has a wide flammability domain [19], a very low minimum
ignition energy [19], a high flame propagation speed, a high propensity
for flame acceleration (FA) [20], and a high sensitivity to detona-
tion [20,21]. As pointed out by Astbury [22], the combustion properties
of hydrogen are significantly different from those of more conventional
fuels, and a specific evaluation of the risk related to accidental hydro-
gen combustion is needed. To illustrate this aspect, Table 1 compares
the safety related properties of hydrogen and methane which have been
compiled by Das [23] and Klebanof et al. [24]. A good reference of
H2 combustion properties of relevance to industrial applications can
be found in H2Tools [17], which also contains some comparisons with
other fuels.

Early research on hydrogen safety was motivated by the hydrogen-
risk in nuclear power plant facilities. In 1979, a severe accident oc-
curred at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the U.S. The
partial loss of the cooling capability of the reactor in unit 2 induced the
partial melt-down of the core and the formation of hydrogen, which
eventually led to an explosion [25]. Although the consequences of
this accident were very limited, since the containment vessel could
withstand the explosion over-pressure, this event has been the starting
point of a large program devoted to the characterization of hydrogen
explosions [20]. In 2011, a severe accident at the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear plant in Japan occurred as a consequence of the most severe
earthquake and subsequent tsunami ever measured in Japan. The com-
plete loss of electricity supply led to core melt and to the production
of large amounts of hydrogen, which eventually ignited and broke
the third confinement barrier, i.e., the containment building [25].
This catastrophic event has further motivated the study of the critical
conditions leading to hydrogen explosions in nuclear plants.

Several review papers have been published about hydrogen safety.
The early review paper of Najjar [26] provided a good introduction
to main physical hazards of hydrogen in different applications. By
combining literature analysis with practical survey, Yang et al. [27]
reviewed key issues concerning hydrogen safety, including hydrogen
incident investigation, hydrogen leakage and diffusion, hydrogen ig-
nition, and explosion. Abohamzeh et al. [28] focused on literature
addressing safety challenges related to hydrogen storage, transmission,
and application processes. They analyzed a range of release and dis-
persion scenarios and their associated hazards for quantitative risk
assessment. Chau et al. [29] assessed hydrogen production technology
based on efficiency, safety, and infrastructure, by using a multi-criteria
decision making integrated analytic hierarchy process and life-cycle
index approach. West et al. [30] critically reviewed hydrogen safety
data collection tools, highlighting the importance of more compre-
hensive collection of hydrogen incident data. The recent review of
Yang et al. [31] focused on research related to high pressure leakage
diffusion, highlighting related knowledge gaps. Moradi and Groth [32]

reviewed the state-of-the-art in risk and reliability analysis. In the
context of applications of hydrogen technologies, the critical review of
Messaoudani et al. [33] focused on the hazards, safety and knowledge
gaps on hydrogen distribution via natural gas grid while the review
of Ustolin et al. [34] considered the loss of integrity of hydrogen
technologies. Boivin et al. [35] recently examined the fundamentals of
various aspects related to hydrogen safety.

Despite the potential of hydrogen to induce an accidental com-
bustion event, the occurrence of catastrophic events is relatively lim-
ited [18]. This is partially because hydrogen has been historically
used primarily as a specialty industrial gas with close attention to
safety by highly trained users. Future wide-spread use of hydrogen will
inevitably result in close contact between hydrogen and the public. This
change of paradigm brings additional safety concerns as, given the high
reactivity and destructive potential of hydrogen, accidental combus-
tion could strongly compromise the development of a hydrogen-based
economy. To bring the benefits of hydrogen to the society and ensure
its acceptance by the general public, hydrogen technologies must be
safely developed, introduced, and used [18]. Safety is of the utmost
importance in many aspects of hydrogen economy, including research
and development, and demonstration and deployment [36]. Hydrogen
safety is, hence, an active area of research that supports the safe and
sustainable implementation and operation of hydrogen systems [36–
38] with appropriate regulations, codes and standards (RCS), which
need to be underpinned by strong scientific principles [38].

The development of hydrogen energy applications has fueled a
series of international efforts. In Europe, the Network of Excellence for
Hydrogen Safety ‘‘HySAFE’’ was funded by the European Commission
between 2005 and 2009. A summary of HySAFE can be found in Jordan
et al. [37]. Reinecke et al. [39] further summarized the experimental
facilities on hydrogen safety identified through HySAFE. Following the
successful completion of the HySAFE project, the partners launched
the International Association for Hydrogen Safety, ‘‘HySAFE’’ in 2009
(https://hysafe.info/), which also organizes the worldwide unique bi-
ennial International Conference on Hydrogen Safety ICHS [40]. Tolias
et al. [41,42] and Baraldi et al. [43] tried to provide Best Practice
Guidelines (BPG) in numerical simulations for Fuel Cells and Hydrogen
applications as part of EU funded ‘‘SUpport to SAfety ANalysis of
Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies’’ SUSANA project. The recom-
mended BPG focused on the needs relevant to various activities related
to the assessments of hazard/risk in hydrogen facilities, including
consultancy, CFD simulation, and the establishment of regulations.

However, it should be noted that substantial progress has been achieved
in the development, validation and applications of CFD techniques for
hydrogen safety since the publication of these BPG.

In the U.S., the Department of Energy sponsored a series of hy-
drogen research projects in several national laboratories. Much of the
research is summarized in San Marchi et al. [38] and Barilo et al. [36].
Most of the research is pre-normative, primarily motivated by the need
to establish robust RCS for emerging hydrogen technologies. Some of
the work informed the development of Hydrogen Plus Other Alterna-
tive Fuels Risk Assessment Models (HyRAM+) [44–46], which will be
discussed in the next section.

1.2. Risk analysis, codes and standards

Being the lightest element in the periodic table, although the energy
density of hydrogen is high by mass (120 MJ/kg), the volumetric
density is generally low (10 MJ/m3 at NTP). Improved volumetric
hydrogen density can be achieved by storing the fuel as a compressed
gas, a liquid (20 K or −253 ◦C), cryo-compression (low temperature and
high pressure), or attached to another molecule (e.g., as a hydride).
The current technologies to store sufficient amounts of hydrogen in
practical applications include compressed gas and cryogenic liquid.
Compressed cylinders or storage of hydrogen as a gas typically requires
high-pressure tanks with pressure from several tens to a hundred
MPa. Storage of hydrogen as a liquid requires cryogenic tempera-
tures because the boiling point of hydrogen at one atmosphere is
−252.8 ◦C, which is well below the freezing temperature of oxygen (O2)
(−218.8 ◦C). There are safety concerns related to accidental release of
cryogenic liquid hydrogen, which evaporates with a volume expansion
of 1:848, posing significant risk as a highly flammable gas. Fueling
stations storing hydrogen in its liquid phase present an economical
advantage due to the high density of liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen gas has
no flash point as it is fully vaporized at ambient conditions. This also
indicates that cryogenic hydrogen flashes for all temperatures above
20 K.

Because it is non-toxic, most of the risk in the use of hydrogen (aside
from the pressure and/or cryogenic hazards) stem from its combustion
properties. Vapors of liquid hydrogen are easily ignited by weak (ther-
mal) ignition sources and become flammable at a low percentage in
air [24]. As cryogenic liquid hydrogen is typically stored at pressures
from 1 to around 3.5 MPa, ignition of accidentally released cryogenic
liquid hydrogen could result in jet flames. Delayed ignition could

also result in hydrogen explosions. Relatively little insight is available
about cryogenic liquid hydrogen jet flames [47] and the extent of
the ignition delay that could result in damaging explosions. Cryogenic
liquid hydrogen jet flames involve typical physicochemical processes of
spray combustion such as atomization, dispersion, evaporation, mixing,
ignition and flame propagation, as well as additional unique processes
and physics associated with the extreme low temperatures such as flash
evaporation, cryogenic boiling, condensation/freezing of surrounding
gases especially oxygen [48]. The oxygen frozen by liquid hydrogen,
once warmed up by the flame would evaporate and result in oxygen en-
riched combustion or even secondary explosion. The inner-/inter-phase
interactions could also influence the combustion behavior, rendering
it different from typical spray combustion. The gas–liquid–solid mul-
tiphase reacting flow under extreme conditions further increase the
complexity of cryogenic liquid hydrogen flames. All risk analyses and
the codes and standards that govern hydrogen’s use must consider
hydrogen’s combustion properties.

As shown in Fig. 2, the loss of containment (LOC) of hydrogen
has the potential to lead to a hazardous scenario. Scenarios outlined
in red dashes have the potential to be hazardous; these releases of
hydrogen can be gas or liquid, forming small leaks, jets or liquid pools.
As hydrogen has a wide flammability range and requires very little
energy for ignition, many incidents due to hydrogen LOC have resulted
in ignition, followed by fire and/or explosions [18].

A quantitative risk assessment (QRA) factors in the frequency of the
LOC, the consequences, and the potential to cause harm (most often to
humans). QRA can be used either to assess the safety of a particular
site (e.g., see [49–51]), or to help inform safety codes and standards
(e.g., see [52,53]). One toolkit that ties all of these factors together
that was developed specifically for hydrogen is HyRAM+ [44,45,54].
This software considers the impact of radiation from jet flames and the
consequences from overpressure from the delayed ignition of hydrogen
either in an unconfined space or after accumulation in an enclosure.
Other methods for performing QRA follow a formal process, such as
that outlined in the ‘‘Purple Book’’ [46], which recommends utilizing
industry standard software to perform consequence analyses. While
detailed discussion about QRA is outside the scope of this paper, it
should be mentioned that a range of risk assessment tools are available
to industry. They are relatively easy to use, and particularly suitable for
screening analysis. However, they are confined by the limitations of the
embedded methodology, failure frequency and reduced order models
such as PHAST [55] can be used for screening analysis to identify
critical areas for which a combination of engineering models and CFD
analysis should be conducted for more detailed consequence analysis
using established software such as FLACS [56], ANSYS Fluent [57] or
OpenFOAM [58], etc. Users are recommended to consider the pros and
cons of each software and their range of validations when selecting the

predictive tools. Skjold et al. [59] gave interesting perspectives con-
cerning reliable engineering models for evaluating the consequences of
specific scenarios of accidental fire and explosion.

As noted by Moretto and Quong [53], different jurisdictions (coun-
try, state, locality) adopt and often follow different standards, making
it challenging to develop a comprehensive list. There are different
international organizations, such as the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), and the International Electro-technical Commis-
sion (IEC) that have working groups and publish standards related
to hydrogen technologies. Many jurisdictions in the US have adopted
codes and standards from the National Fire Protection Association,
including NFPA 2: Hydrogen Technologies Code [47]. This standard, as
well as standards from ISO (e.g., ISO 19880-1:2020 Gaseous hydrogen
- Fueling stations - Part 1: General Requirements) and others, provide
safety (or setback, or separation) distances between hydrogen con-
taining infrastructure and different exposures (e.g., building openings,
combustible materials, other fuels) that are typically risk-informed
and are meant to reduce the risk of hydrogen siting to an acceptable
level, with the understanding that all accidents cannot be prevented.
It is critical that the models and reasoning used to develop these
safety standards are based on sound scientific principles, of which the
fundamentals of hydrogen combustion is a key piece.

1.3. Outline and scope of the review

The present review mainly focuses on the recent (primarily within
the past 15–20 years) experimental, analytical, and numerical results,
which contribute to a better understanding of the risks associated with
accidental hydrogen combustion and the development of appropriate
regulations to ensure the safe use of hydrogen. For some specific topics,
a more comprehensive review is provided in order to give a compre-
hensive view of a specific topic and include important seminal papers.
Fundamental combustion aspects that would be more applicable to the
use of hydrogen in a combustion system, such as the chemical kinetic
schemes for hydrogen combustion, the treatment of laminar flames, and
others, are only summarized as needed. Some safety-relevant aspects
of practical relevance, such as the quenching mechanisms of flame and
detonation arrestors, are also only briefly discussed with key references
provided to interested readers. It is noted that abnormal phenomena
like flashback in the turbulent core flow, wall boundary layer, or due
to vortex breakdown, are relevant to the safety of combustion devices.
However, these aspects on their own can be a topic for separate review
papers and are hence considered to be outside the scope of the present
review.

It is acknowledged that other recent reviews also provide important
information relevant to the safety of hydrogen, as discussed in Sec-
tion 1.1. For a more detailed review about the fundamental aspects

of hydrogen combustion, readers should refer to the comprehensive
review of Sanchez and Williams [60]. For those with particular interest
in flame acceleration and deflagration to detonation transition, the
earlier review of Ciccarelli and Dorofeev [20] provides much insight.
Oran et al. [61] recently provided a comprehensive review about the
mechanisms and occurrence of detonations in vapor cloud explosions,
which are also relevant to hydrogen safety. Some interesting perspec-
tives were given by Skjold et al. [59] about the role of fundamental
and applied combustion research in providing reliable engineering
models for assessing the consequences of accidental fire and explo-
sion scenarios. While acknowledging the practical importance of such
models in consequence analysis, they pointed out the aspects whose
understanding should significantly be improved.

This review firstly discusses various ignition mechanisms in Sec-
tion 2. Hydrogen jet fires, which can be formed during pressurized hy-
drogen release events, are discussed in Section 3 covering experiments,
analytical, and numerical modeling. This is followed by experimental,
theoretical, and numerical studies of hydrogen explosions in Section 4,
which naturally leads to the review of research on flame acceleration
(FA), and deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in Section 5.
Considering that DDT leads to detonation, and that detonation may
also be induced directly under special circumstances, the subject of
detonation is discussed separately in Section 6. A summary is given at
the end of each section. Concluding remarks are provided in Section 7.

2. Ignition phenomena

While some fundamental properties related to hydrogen ignition
have been summarized in Section 1, here we focus on the ignition of
accidentally released hydrogen. Potential ignition sources in this con-
text include flames, electrical sparks, fused wires, hot surfaces, heating
due to mechanical friction, rapid adiabatic compression, shock waves
and catalytic materials. All of these processes have the potential to heat
a portion of the combustible mixture to a sufficiently high temperature
such that adjacent un-combusted layers also react, producing a flame,
which propagates throughout the mixture. Combustion is the sustained
reaction of a fuel and oxygen. The global reaction H2 + 1∕2O2 →
H2O has many intermediate steps, and the interruption or avoidance
of a step can arrest propagation of the combustion reaction. It is
therefore important to understand some details of the ignition process
to understand the conditions for fire, deflagration, or detonation to
develop from unintended releases.

2.1. Combustion chemistry of hydrogen-based mixtures

Most energy production systems relying on the utilization of hy-
drogen as a fuel use oxygen or air as an oxidant. Similarly, the safety
aspects of hydrogen very often involve the accidental release of hy-
drogen in the ambient air. Therefore, it is most relevant to summarize
the main aspects of chemical kinetics of hydrogen–oxygen/air mix-
tures, which are important to understand ignition and combustion
phenomena.

Because the chemistry of hydrogen is an indispensable basis for
understanding and describing the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, it
has received a considerable amount of attention. This chemical system
is typically described by (i) 8 to 12 species, H2, O2, H, O, OH, OH∗,
HO2, H2O2, H2O, and several inert gas like N2, Ar, and He, and (ii) 20
to 30 reversible reactions. The reactions of ozone are usually ignored,
because of the insignificant quantity of O3 that could be formed under
combustion conditions. Many details reaction models [62–65] have
been proposed over the years and an example, proposed by Burke
et al. [62], is given in Table 2. It is noted that the reactions of OH∗ are
not included in this reaction model, although they could be relevant to
accurately reproducing the ignition delay-time derived in shock-tube
experiments using chemiluminescence [66,67]. Interested readers may
refer to the recent papers of Sharipov et al. [68,69] concerning the
latest developments on the chemical kinetics of OH∗ under combus-
tion relevant conditions. The reaction rate constants included in the
reaction mechanisms of hydrogen–oxygen mixtures largely come from
experimental measurements. The simple structure of several molecules
of this system enables to employ UV and IR laser techniques to directly
measure these constants. The mechanism of Hong et al. [63] is a perfect
example of such an approach since it includes several rates which
were updated based on laser absorption measurements behind reflected
shock wave. In addition, theoretical calculation of rate constants are
also of primary importance for developing chemically consistent reac-
tion models. In particular, high-pressure limits are difficult to access ex-
perimentally but can be calculated with good accuracy [70]. According
to Sanchez and Williams [60], the reactions of the hydrogen–oxygen
system can be classified into four categories: (i) shuffle reactions; (ii)
hydroperoxyl reactions; (iii) radical–radical recombination reactions;
and (iv) hydrogen peroxide reactions. A detailed discussion on the role
of these different reaction types as well as on the origin of their rate
constants is provided therein [60], and in other Refs. [62,63]. While the

reaction initiation is attributed to -R10, the pressure- and temperature-
dependent competition between the shuffle reactions and the reactions
of the hydroperoxyl largely dominate the evolution of the combustion
properties of hydrogen–oxygen mixtures [64]. These features are nicely
explained by considering the variations of the adiabatic ignition delay-
time with pressure and temperature, which is of primary importance
for many ignition phenomena.

The ignition delay-time (τi) is a commonly measured property that
gives insight into intermediate reactions during the ignition processes
of a fuel. Hydrogen–oxygen–diluent mixtures, with the diluent being
argon or nitrogen in most cases, have been extensively studied to
measure τi since the 1950’s and the pioneering study of Schott and
Kinsey [71]. Available data cover a wide range of conditions and
compositions: temperatures from 800 to 2700 K, pressures from 20
to 9000 kPa, equivalence ratios from 0.01 to 4, and diluent mole
fractions from 0 to 0.9985. Ignition delay data have been measured
in shock tube (ST) [64,67,72–76] and rapid compression machine
(RCM) [64,77,78]. Most data from the literature have been compiled
in the Respecth database (available at: http://respecth.chem.elte.hu/
respecth/index.php). Relatively recent efforts to improve the measure-
ment of τi in ST include the development of the constrained reactor
volume by Hanson et al. [79], as well as the works of Urzay et al. [80]
and of Hu et al. [81] which have been focused on the characterization
of the effect of impurities.

Although the measurement of the ignition delay-time at low tem-
perature is complicated by non-ideal facility effects [60], the tem-
perature dependence of τi at high temperature is well established.
Fig. 3 shows the ignition delay-time calculated for various hydrogen–
air mixtures using the detailed reaction model of Hong et al. [63]. The

adiabatic, constant pressure (CP) reactor model in Cantera [82] was
used for these calculations. The ignition delay-time curve demonstrates
a pronounced change of slope, whose precise temperature location
depends on the mixture composition and pressure. This cross-over
temperature delineates two regimes of hydrogen combustion: (i) the
high-temperature regime, in which the oxidation process is dominated
by chain-branching reactions; and (ii) the low-temperature regime, in
which the oxidation process is dominated by the reactions that involve
HO2 and H2O2.

Although additional complexity arises for lean and rich mixtures
[60], it is well known that the existence of the cross-over temperature
is due to the competition between the chain-branching reaction R1:
H+O2=OH+O and the termination reaction R9: H+O2(+M)=HO2(+M).
Following the seminal analysis of Lewis and von Elbe [83], the location
of the cross-over temperature is determined by the condition 2k1 =
k9[M], where k represents the rate constant. It is found that the cross-
over temperature is shifted toward higher temperatures as pressure is
increased [60] (around 1000 K at P =101 kPa and approximately 1400
K at P =3040 kPa, see Fig. 3). Boeck et al. [84] calculated the reduced
activation energy (θ) for the stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture over
a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The reduced activation
energy is defined as

Fig. 3. Ignition delay-time of hydrogen–air mixtures calculated using the adiabatic
constant pressure reactor model and the reaction mechanism of Hong et al. [63].

The competition between the high- and low-temperature chemistry in
the hydrogen–oxygen chemical system, and the associated shape of
the delay-time curve, is of primary importance for many auto-ignition
phenomena, especially at near-critical conditions between ignition and
quenching. The second-explosion limit, and associated peninsula in
the auto-ignition diagram, is a result of this competition, as shown in
several analytical studies, see [85]. The significantly longer ignition
delay-time in the low-temperature regime may play an important role
in the development of reactive bifurcated shock following reflection
from a straight wall. Critical conditions for hot surface ignition [86]
and ignition in an expanding medium [87] are largely determined by
the competition between R1 and R9. These aspects are further discussed
in the remainder of this section. A similar cross-over phenomenon
is also observed under flame conditions [60,62,64,88]. In particular,
O’Conaire et al. [89] attributed the decrease of the mass burning
velocity above 10 atm to the increase of k9 with pressure.

At high pressure and low temperature, the chemical reactions in-
volving H2O2 become important. Under such conditions, the increased
rate of R9 strongly limits the chain-branching processes, which leads to
the accumulation of H2O2, formed notably through R14 and -R17 [60].
The temperature increase associated to exothermic reactions such as
R14 could eventually bring the chemical system in a thermodynamic
state in which H2O2 becomes unstable and rapidly decomposes to
form two hydroxyl radicals, speeding up the overall reaction rate. Such
processes are particularly relevant to near-limit combustion phenom-
ena [60].

A large number of reaction mechanisms are available in the lit-
erature for describing the chemistry of hydrogen–oxygen mixtures.
Olm et al. [90] quantitatively evaluated 19 reaction models against a
comprehensive experimental database which includes ST, RCM, flame
speed, jet stirred reactor, and flow reactor data. In general, the reaction
mechanisms developed at the Combustion Chemistry Center at the
University of Ireland at Galway [64,89] demonstrated the best overall
agreement. Despite the outstanding performances of these mechanisms,
it should be kept in mind that for specific conditions, other mechanisms
may perform better.

Hydrogen can react with other oxidants, such as halogens [91]
or nitrogen oxides [92,93]. Each mixture exhibit different properties.
For example, H2/Cl2 can get ignited by UV light [94], whereas some
H2/NO2 mixtures can demonstrate multi-stage heat release [93]. Spe-
cific risk assessment needs to be performed for each hydrogen–oxidant
mixture. A detailed description of the combustion properties of such
mixtures is beyond the scope of the present review.

2.2. Flammability and explosion limits

According to [95], the flammability limits are defined as the lim-
iting compositions for which a self-sustained flame can be observed
under specific thermodynamic conditions. These limits are overall well
established because of their primary importance for assessing the risk of
accidental hydrogen explosion in nuclear power plants. In this frame-
work, the flammability domain is typically considered for hydrogen–
air–water vapor mixtures, see Fig. 4. In addition to the thermodynamic
state, a number of parameters can influence the determination of the
flammability domain, including the energy of the ignition source, the
source location, the geometry of the vessel, and phenomena related to
buoyancy and motion in the fresh gas [95].

The explosion limits are defined as the critical composition (at
fixed thermodynamic state), or thermodynamics conditions (at fixed
composition), separating auto-ignition and no-ignition events. For a sto-
ichiometric hydrogen–oxygen mixture in a closed vessel, the explosion
limits are well established and expressed in a Z-shaped curve [83],
giving the boundaries for the so-called first, second and third explosion
limits. Recent studies on this topic [85] have focused on establishing
analytical relationships to describe these limits, see Fig. 5.

2.3. Reflected shock ignition

During a hydrogen combustion event, a shock wave may be formed
as a result of various phenomena such as flame acceleration, high-
pressure expansion, rapid liquid evaporation. In many cases, the inci-
dent shock wave is not able to directly initiate an explosive reaction
through adiabatic compression. However, the temperature and pressure
behind the reflected shock are usually high enough to initiate the
combustion reaction [20]. Ignition behind a reflected shock wave is a
continuous topic of research in the context of shock tube experiments.
Depending on a number of parameters, reflected shock ignition can take
place according to either a ‘‘strong’’ mode or a ‘‘mild/weak/remote’’
mode [97]. Strong ignition takes place at high temperature and is
characterized by ignition at a single locus in the vicinity of the end wall
and the formation of a blast wave. On the other hand, mild ignition
takes place at low temperature and is characterized by a distributed
ignition in a highly non-uniform mixture with the formation of several
flame kernels, which eventually merge with each other [98]. In this
section, the idealized scenario of a normal shock reflection off a flat
end-wall is considered in more details. It is noted that shock reflection
off a non-flat end-wall, for example a conical or hemispherical end-wall,
significantly modifies the ignition characteristics [99].

measurements demonstrated both homogeneous and non-homogeneous
ignition events. For H2-O2 mixtures, they noted a sharp increase of the
ignition delay-time in the temperature range 970–1070 K, for reflected
shock pressures of 101, 202, and 303 kPa. Comparison with chemical
kinetic calculations showed a very good agreement at high tempera-
tures and significant discrepancies in the low-temperature regime with
a very important over-estimation of the delay-time by the chemical
kinetic model. The influence of vibrational non-equilibrium of O2 and
of the boundary layer on the ignition process were ruled out. The
authors pointed out that if the ignition is mild enough, then the ignition
delay-time might be greatly influenced by the specific conditions in
the ignition volume. Meyer and Oppenheim [100] used stroboscopic
laser-schlieren imaging to characterized the strong and weak modes
of ignition in undiluted stoichiometric H2-O2 mixtures. Strong igni-
tion was characterized by a homogeneous ignition in a thin layer of
gas adjacent to the end-wall. The combustion wave then propagates
downstream of the end-wall and transition to a detonation within few
microseconds, see Fig. 6. In the low-temperature regime, they observed
ignition at several locations, flame propagation, and eventually detona-
tion onset but after tens of microseconds. Meyer and Oppenheim [98,
100] pointed out that at low temperature, flow non-uniformities related
to gas-dynamics had enough time to develop and led to the distributed
ignition process. They proposed a theoretical model which considers
that strong ignition can take place if power pulses of heat release
originating from distinct hot spots in the non-uniform medium are
sufficiently coherent in time. This analysis led to the criterion that
the strong ignition limit is located on an isoline of ignition delay-time
gradient in the pressure–temperature space, with the value ∂τi∕∂T =
−2 μs/K providing a good agreement with the experimental data. In
addition to these seminal studies, several investigations were performed
on mild and strong ignition over the years. Interestingly, Blumenthal
et al. [102] reported that remote ignition in hydrogen–oxygen mixtures
did not always lead to detonation onset.

While remote ignition and associated pre-ignition compression have
been considered more recently by several authors [103,104] as the
main source of discrepancies between the experimental ignition delay-
time and the ones calculated using the adiabatic constant volume
reactor model, other authors [105] have pointed out the important role
of quantum effects on the reaction rates under high-density conditions.
Although not performed with hydrogen as a fuel, the studies of Ya-
mashita et al. [106] and Uygun et al. [107] are worth mentioning,
as they point out the importance of reflected shock bifurcation under
weak ignition conditions. The ultra-high-speed schlieren imaging study
performed by Yamashita et al. [106] provides a very insightful view
on the sequences of events that are taking place during strong and
mild ignition. The study of Uygun et al. [107] very clearly establishes
the relationship between the pressure evolution in the test section and
pre-ignition and propagation of flame kernels during a mild ignition
event. Ninnemann et al. [108] recently studied the impact of the
ST cleanliness on the ignition process behind reflected shock wave.
They combined end-wall high-speed imaging with pressure and OH*
emission measurements. For the mixture with high dilution, no pre-
ignition event could be observed but the delay-time measured with OH*
emission was associated to a circumferential ignition, while the inner
volume ignited at a much later time. They observed mild ignition and
significant pre-ignition pressure rise in the low temperature regime for
the mixture with low dilution, see Fig. 7. Regardless of the dilution
level, no significant impact of particle impurity on the delay-time could
be identified in their work. This seems in contradiction with the results
of Tulgestke et al. [109] who noted a significant impact of particle
impurity on long ignition delay-time in ST facilities.

2.3.1. Experimental studies

Despite experimental limitations which prevented obtaining deep
insight into the phenomenon, non-homogeneous ignition behind re-
flected shock wave was reported as early as 1949 and in the 1950’s
[101]. Several experimental studies in the 1960’s and 1970’s employed
schlieren imaging and/or streak systems to further investigate the mode
of ignition behind reflected shock waves. Saytzev and Soloukhin [101]
studied hydrogen–oxygen mixtures in the ranges 900–1700 K and 101–
303 kPa. Despite the very weak density fluctuations they reported,
localized hot spot ignition can clearly be observed in their images.

energy content of the mixture is large enough, detonation initiation
can take place. While such 1D numerical studies provide additional
insights into the reflected shock ignition phenomenon, they cannot
capture the full complexity of the interaction between the reflected
shock and the boundary layer (BL) formed behind the incident wave
and two-dimensional (2D) or even three-dimensional (3D) simulations
are required.

2.3.2.2. Two- and three-dimensional simulations. During reflected shock
ignition events, the growth of the BL behind the incident shock wave
and its interaction with the reflected shock cannot be neglected. Under
certain conditions, the resulting bifurcated shock structure that arises
from this interaction creates a highly non-uniform flow field and is
believed to play a dominant role during remote ignition phenomenon.
A bifurcated shock wave is comprised of three shocks, a slip line, a
separated bubble close to the wall, and a wall jet, see Fig. 8 reproduced
from [116]. The three shocks are the normal portion of the reflected
shock, an oblique or lambda shock (the foot), and a tail shock, and
form a triple point associated with the slip line. Bifurcation has been
extensively studied since the 1950’s [116–118] and, with the increas-
ing computational capabilities available worldwide, recent numerical
studies can even account for three-dimensional effects [119–123].

Ihme et al. [124] performed numerical simulations of reflected
shock ignition of a lean hydrogen–oxygen mixture in an adiabatic 2D
channel. The reflected shock pressure and temperature were 506 kPa
and 1100 K. Using a non-reactive simulation, they showed that viscous
heating could generate local temperatures in the BL higher by 150 K
than the bulk flow temperature. In subsequent reactive simulations,
they showed that initial ignition takes place within the BL in close
vicinity of the side-wall. Rapidly after this local ignition, a volumet-
ric ignition is observed close to the end-wall that rapidly leads to
detonation onset, which is consistent with a strong ignition event.
Khokhlov et al. [120] studied the formation of hot spot behind reflected
shock waves in a stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture. They considered a
3D square channel with a 5 cm by 5 cm cross-section. They noted
that the recirculation region of the bifurcated structure is highly un-
stable and continuously sheds vortices. Acoustic waves formation is
related to vortex shedding and modulates the shock wave, which
leads to production of entropy perturbations. Because these entropy
perturbations provide persistent elevated temperature regions, they
constitute the most likely regions for hot spot ignition. Following hot
spot ignition at these locations, detonation onset was rapidly achieved.
Grogan and Ihme [125] employed 2D simulations to study reflected
shock ignition in H2-O2(-Ar) mixtures. They noted that under similar
thermodynamic conditions, weak ignition can occur when the wall is
treated as adiabatic whereas strong ignition can occur when the wall

shock tube with an inner diameter of 14.17 cm.

such an approach enables isolation of the gas dynamics effect on
reflected shock ignition. In particular, a gradient of ignition delay-
time is always intrinsically present behind a reflected shock, with
the shorter delay-time being located close to the end-wall. Such a
gradient can significantly affect the ignition delay-time and/or lead
to detonation initiation through the well-known Zeldovich gradient
mechanism [110]. Oran et al. [111,112] studied strong and weak
ignition behind reflected shock wave and found that in both cases,
the sequence of events was: (i) formation of a reaction wave, (ii)
its strong acceleration; and (iii) its coupling with the reflected shock
to form a transmitted detonation wave. In the strong ignition case,
ignition is taking place in the close vicinity of the end-wall, whereas
in the mild ignition case, the initial ignition kernel was not located
at the end-wall but several cm away from it. The authors attributed
this feature to numerical errors, which induce temperature and velocity
fluctuations. Although these perturbations are present in both strong
and weak ignition simulations, their influence is magnified during weak
ignition due to the increased temperature-sensitivity of chemical pro-
cesses at low temperature. Melguizo-Gavilanes and Bauwens [113,114]
employed a non-dimensional formulation along with a three-step Ar-
rhenius chemical model. The local explosion at the end-wall generates
pressure waves, which influence chemical dynamics in the neighboring
gas regions. A feedback-loop mechanism between chemical heat release
and acoustics waves is taking place, and eventually leads to the onset of
detonation. This behavior is more and more pronounced and rapid as
the energy content of the mixture is increased. They reported a decrease
of the ignition delay-time by up to approximately 15% for an ignition
probe located at a distance from the end-wall. The work of Melguizo-
Gavilanes and Bauwens [113,114] was extended to include detailed
chemistry by Huang et al. [115]. They found that the reduction of the
ignition delay-time increased linearly with distance from the end-wall.
The reductions in delay-time were more pronounced than in [113,114],
probably because Huang et al. [115] considered much longer distances
from the end-wall for the locations of the ignition probes. In addition,
they also reported that if an appropriate gradient is present and the

12

are formed at some distance from the end-wall and could lead to
remote ignition away from the end-wall, which is consistent with the
experimental observation. Kiverin et al. [126] further studied reflected
shock ignition in hydrogen–air mixtures, considering a wide range
of heights for the 2D channel. They showed that in large channel,
remote ignition is more likely due to shear heating, while in small
channel, such ignition can be rather attributed to the compression of
the central part of the flow field by boundary layer growth. Based on
these considerations, they identified three modes of mild ignition: (i)
ignition in the vortical structures within the BL due to shear heating; (ii)
ignition within the recirculation zone of the bifurcated shock structure
due to shear heating; and (iii) ignition in the central part of the tube due
to compression heating induced by the BL growth. Despite the existence
of these distinct modes of ignition, the ignition delay-times obtained
are close to each other. Lipkowicz et al. [123,127] performed 2D and
3D simulations using a grid with as many as 2.2 billions computational
cells. A wide variety of non-reactive and reactive mixtures were studied
including pure Ar, pure N2, and H2-O2 and H2-CO mixtures with
Ar dilution ranging from 0 to 95%. Under high-dilution conditions,
despite the very weak reflected shock bifurcation, both remote and
strong ignition events were observed depending on the reflected shock
temperature. Remote ignition was typically observed at several tens of
cm from the end-wall. Similar results were obtained for two different
reaction mechanisms. For the undiluted mixtures, they observed strong
and mild ignition events with respective ignition locations close to
the end-wall, and away from the end-wall along the tube axis. The
authors considered these results to be very similar to the ones observed
experimentally [100]. For these simulation cases, they also noted the
formation of a second shock behind the reflected shock wave and
attributed this feature to the formation of a convergent–divergent
Laval-nozzle shaped stream tube. Huang et al. [128] performed 2D sim-
ulations for stoichiometric hydrogen–oxygen. They showed that both
viscous heating and pressure work are responsible for local heating
around the bifurcation foot. The former mechanism dominates at early
time after the SW reflection, while the latter process takes over at
later time. By progressively increasing the reflected shock temperature,
they observed (i) at the lowest temperature, a purely weak ignition
event characterized by ignition at a single location at the side wall
approximately 1 cm behind the tip of the forward-facing oblique shock;
(ii) at slightly higher temperature, a mixed weak and strong ignition
event with two ignition locations, one at the side wall and the other
one close to the end wall at the shear layer between the BL layer and
the bulk flow; (iii) strong ignition at a single location close to the end
wall. Event (ii), mixed weak and strong ignition, is shown in Fig. 10.

2.3.3. Simplified models for predicting the strong–weak ignition limit

Boeck et al. [84] compared several simple models which can pre-
dict if strong or mild ignition will take place. These models are: (i)
the extended second explosion limit based on the analysis of Lewis
and von Elbe [83]; (ii) the sensitivity parameter proposed by Meyer
and Oppenheim [98,100]; (iii) the χ number proposed by Radulescu
et al. [129]; (iv) the model of Grogan and Ihme [119] based on the
bifurcation Damkhöler number presented in the previous paragraph;
and (v) the model of Thomas et al. [130] which considers that the
outcome of the shock reflection, i.e., ignition or failure, depends on the
competition between chemical heat release and volumetric expansion
generated from the shock diffraction off the top corner of the finite
height obstacle. Applying the model of [119] requires making some
assumptions concerning the dimensions of the tube. The model of [130]
requires assuming an obstacle height and depicts a slightly different
situation than a shock reflection off a flat end-wall. Despite the very
different underlying assumptions employed to develop these models,
they typically agree to within 10% in terms of critical Mach number
separating the occurrence of mild and strong ignition events.

shock wave. A stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture diluted with 80% Ar was employed in the
simulation. The incident shock speed was 675 m/s and p5 = 36 kPa.

is treated as isothermal. This difference of behavior was attributed
to additional heating of the gas in the boundary layer by viscous
dissipation effects in the case of the simulation with adiabatic wall.
Overall, the simulation results were found to be consistent with the
domains of weak and strong ignition previously reported [97,100].
They also show that a small tube diameter leads to faster ignition than
a large tube diameter. They attributed the onset of detonation during a
weak ignition event to the shock wave amplification by coherent energy
release (SWACER) mechanism. They finally show that for similar post-
reflected shock conditions, the use of different reaction mechanisms
can lead to different ignition modes. Grogan and Ihme [119] further
studied the influence of the interaction between the reflected shock
and the boundary layer on the ignition process in ST. They defined a
bifurcation Damkhöler number (Dabif ) which corresponds to the ratio
of the characteristic time of growth of the bifurcated shock structure to
the characteristic chemical time-scale. According to this model, within
the regime in which bifurcation can take place, strong ignition would
occur for Dabif > 1, while weak ignition would occur for Dabif < 1.
Reasonable agreement with experimental data was found. Kiverin and
Yakovenko [121,122] performed 2D and 3D numerical simulations of
full ST with H2-O2-Ar mixtures as the test mixture and He as the driver
gas. Both square and cylindrical channels were simulated. They studied
in detail the interaction of the reflected wave with the BL behind the
incident shock. They noted that this incident BL is intrinsically unstable
and develops roller vortices at some distance away from the end wall.
Following their interaction with the bifurcated shock formed during the
reflected shock interaction with the laminar part of the incident BL, the
vortical structures are separated from the wall. Local heating is taking
place due to kinetic energy dissipation as the gas in the boundary layer
decelerates, while heat transfer at the wall induces local cooling. These
competing effects result in temperature stratification at the BL scale
with the hot regions being associated with the roller vortices at the
shear layer between the BL and the bulk flow. The temperature field
further evolves to form a hairpin forest. The flow structure is even more
complex if corners are present since two adjacent reflected BL interact
with each other, see Fig. 9.

Kiverin and Yakovenko [122] report hot spot at the limit between
the BL and the mean flow whose temperature is several hundreds K
higher than the temperature behind the normal portion of the reflected
shock. Because of the time required to form the vortical structures
in the BL behind the incident shock, regions of higher temperature

2.4. Spontaneous ignition

Spontaneous ignition may take place as a results of the sudden
release of pressurized hydrogen or liquid hydrogen storage devices.
Historic data showed that accidentally released pressurized hydrogen
could ignite in the absence of clearly identifiable ignition sources [131,
132]. As an example, the experimental investigations of Dryer et al.
[133] were partially motivated by a fire incident in their laboratory
in early 1980s. It was related to the rupture of a pressure relief burst
disk in a hydrogen gas supply system with pressure over 40 bar.
Although that there was no readily identifiable ignition source in the
vicinity, the sudden pressurized release resulted in a large turbulent jet
diffusion flame. Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database (HIAD 2.0)
is a publicly available database collecting systematic data and lessons
learnt on hydrogen-related undesired incidents or accidents [134].
The statistics from 426 incidents in HIAD which were considered of
statistical value in July 2020 [132] indicated that 84% of the accidental
releases resulted in ignition with 56% explosions and 28% fires.

Astbury and Hawksworth [131] analyzed some proposed mecha-
nisms for hydrogen spontaneous ignition, which include heating from
the Joule–Thomson effect, electrostatic charge generation, diffusion
ignition, sudden adiabatic compression, and hot surface ignition. The
Joule–Thomson effect refers to the expansion and cooling of a com-
pressed gas when it is vented to atmosphere through a nozzle. When the
initial temperature is below the Joule–Thomson inversion temperature,
then the gas cools down on expansion. Such is the case of air which
has an inversion temperature of around 325 ◦C. On the other hand, the
Joule–Thomson inversion temperature of hydrogen is approximately -
80 ◦C [135], which means that, under ambient temperature conditions,
the expansion of compressed hydrogen to atmospheric pressure will
induce an increase of temperature of the gas. However, the possibility
of spontaneous ignition due to Joule–Thomson expansion was ruled
out. The lack of experimental evidence about the other ignition mech-
anisms was also highlighted; but it was suggested that two or more of
the postulated mechanisms were present together in some spontaneous
ignition events, e.g., certain form of electrostatic charging might have

contributed to spontaneous ignition of leaks in pressurized hydrogen
release.

Subsequently, considerable amounts of efforts have been directed to
further study the above postulated mechanisms. This section is focused
on diffusion ignition, which has been demonstrated in both laboratory
and full-scale tests [133,136–141] as well as theoretical and numeri-
cal investigations [114,142–151]. The other ignition mechanisms are
discussed in Sections 2.3 and 2.5–2.7.

Zhou et al. [152] reviewed some experimental investigations up
to 2022 focusing on detailed results which are dependent on release
pressure, diameter, tube lengths, etc. Here, the discussions are around
the experimental and numerical modeling approaches as well as the
general trends in the findings. Past experimental and analytical studies
are discussed in the first subsection. Most numerical simulations are
reviewed in the second subsection apart from some which were re-
ported in the same paper as the experimental investigations. Whenever
possible, the authors also express their views about the approaches and
methodologies used.

2.4.1. Experimental investigations of spontaneous ignition

Due to the large volume of publications on this topic in the litera-
ture, only some representative references are included in this review.
A summary of the key experimental investigations is given in Table 3
and further discussions will follow. All reported tests were conducted
for releases through a section of tube, mostly circular, apart from
Yamashita et al. [138] who used square tubes.

Wolanski and Wojciki [153] experimentally investigated the injec-
tion of a combustible gas into an oxidizing atmosphere. They observed
strong shock wave ahead of the under-expanded jet triggered ignition
even though the overall temperature of the released hydrogen was
below its autoignition temperature; and postulated that the ignition
was triggered by the temperature increase of the combustible mixture
due to mass and heat diffusion at the contact region between the
hydrogen and shock-heated oxidizer. Based on their analysis, they
proposed the terminology of diffusion ignition. Subsequently, a series of
experimental studies were carried out to demonstrate diffusion ignition

Images of flame after exiting the tube

of pressurized hydrogen released through a length of tube by Dryer
et al. [133], Mogi et al. [136] and Lee et al. [140]. Burst disks were
used in all these tests to initially separate the pressurized hydrogen and
air. The laboratory tests of Dryer et al. [133] revealed the considerable
effect of the tube internal geometry downstream of the burst disk on the
likelihood of spontaneous ignition, especially for relatively low release
pressures. This led to the postulation that the rupture process of the
burst disk has an important influence on mixing and ignition through
multi-dimensional shock formation, reflection, and interactions. Some
experiments considered rupture disks made from different materials
and drew ‘‘crosses’’ on them prior to the tests [136].

The minimum required release pressure for spontaneous ignition to
occur was found to decrease with the tube length [136,140]. For insuf-
ficient tube lengths in the respective tests, even if spontaneous ignition
occurred, the hydrogen flame only existed briefly at the boundary layer
near the exit but quenched soon after spouting from the tube. The for-
mation of a complete flame across the tube was thought to be important
to initiate sustained spontaneous ignition which could transition into
a jet flame. The effect of the initial diaphragm shape was also found
to have some effect on the propensity for spontaneous ignition [139]
as it influences the subsequent shock-laden flow structure, mixing and
heating. Kitabayashi et al. [157] further revealed that the self-ignited
flame inside the tube underwent a quenching process that prevented it
from being sustained outside the tube when the tube length was longer
than a critical value. The actual critical value was dependent on the
test configuration, especially on the pressure and tube diameter.

Spontaneous ignition of direct release of pressurized hydrogen into
the air has not been demonstrated experimentally. Mironov et al. [141]
experimentally investigated the transient velocity of the shock wave
formed upon diaphragm rupture and suggested the necessity of a
focused air shock wave to trigger self-ignition and speculated that the
presence of some obstacles ahead of the jet exit might promote such
wave focusing. However, their attempt to experimentally demonstrate

this by releasing through a 15 mm opening into a 37-mm in radius
hemispherical cavity failed to result in ignition.

Since 2013, laboratory tests have been conducted with more de-
tailed diagnostic techniques. Using shadowgraph, high-speed direct
photography, pressure and light sensors, several investigations [138,
140,158] tracked the propagating shock waves and flames in a tube.
Their results indicated that ignition occurred initially in the mixed
region near the wall, followed by multiple subsequent ignitions as the
shock wave propagated and the formation of more flammable region
near the wall. Kim et al. [158] provided experimental evidence of
earlier ignition and flame propagation at increased burst pressure as
shown in Fig. 11, where the mixing of hydrogen and air is shown as a
dark region behind the leading shock wave in the shadowgraph, which
covers the whole tube cross section and indicates the development of
the mixing along the tube wall boundary layer. The ignition was found
to initiate at the boundary layer after the induction distance behind
the mixing front. Subsequently, the flame follows up the mixing front
and spread to the mixing tail of the mixing zone as the shock wave
propagated downstream. Some glinting flamelets were also observed
along the boundary layer. The same authors also investigated the effect
of placing a wall at some distance from the tube exit [159]. The wall,
if placed less than 10 diameters from the exit, was found to shorten the
time for the flame to stabilize in the cases where the tube length was
sufficient to facilitate spontaneous ignition and induce a strong flame.
The flame was observed to grow much faster at higher burst pressures
because of a wider expansion of hydrogen. If the tube length was too
short and the flame was not generated inside the tube, the mixing in
the recirculation zone at the edge of the wall was also unable to trigger
ignition.

More recently, Asahara et al. [162] reported direct photography and
shadowgraph images of a self-ignited flame through releases from a
620 mm rectangular tube, which developed into a standing flame as
shown in Fig. 12. They summarized the three possible scenarios from

their own as well as previous research [158] by defining a lower and
upper critical tube length:

1. Tube length < lower critical length: results in insufficient mixing
between hydrogen and air and a residence time less than the
local ignition delay time preventing autoignition from occurring
before the mixture exits the tube.

2. Tube length > upper critical length: results in spontaneous ig-
nition occurring near the tube wall, but the flame kernel in
the mixing region either cannot spread outside this region or
is quenched by the shock wave after propagating out from the
mixing region. Quenching may be due to steam formation inside
the tube and the vortex formed by expanding gas.

3. Tube length within the critical value: the flame kernel exits the
tube before it is quenched. An example is illustrated in Fig. 12,
where the flame image at 204 ms is shown together with the
shadowgraph.

Wang et al. [161] further observed experimentally the evolution of
the jet flame into explosions. This process was characterized by the
formation of the ring-shaped flame which ignited the H2-air mixture
in the shear layer. After the flame reached the top of the jet, it grad-
ually enveloped the jet surface to form fireball, and then accelerated
rapidly, leading to an explosion. The authors suggested that the two
vortex rings played a key role in the subsequent explosion. How-
ever, repeated experiments involving detailed diagnostics providing
quantitative measurements will be desirable to better understand the
phenomena.

It should be noted that while the use of the lower and upper
critical tube length summarizes the scenarios well, the actual critical
values of the tube length depend on a range of parameters including
the release pressure, the tube cross sectional area and shape, and
the environmental conditions including the existence of, distance to,
and layout of other objects in front the nozzle. Gong et al. [148]
derived some quantitative correlations for the critical conditions for the
occurrence of spontaneous ignition from their laboratory experiments,

but their validity is limited to the conditions of the experiments used
in their derivations. Parametric studies (experimental or numerical)
should in principle be capable to determine the critical lengths but
would require relatively large number of tests or numerical simulations.
Current numerical models, although some contain the necessary physics
and use high-order numerical schemes necessary to avoid predicting
spontaneous ignition because of numerical diffusion rather than physi-
cal processes, have not yet been quantitatively validated by the detailed
experimental studies.

2.4.2. Numerical simulations of spontaneous ignition

Table 4 provides an overview of the numerical simulations reported
in the literature. This will be followed by further discussions of key
features.

Numerical studies for releases through tube sections have been
reported by several authors [114,143–150]. Most of these were based
on two-dimensional (2D) studies using various CFD codes with differ-
ent numerical schemes and chemistry models. Some of these studies
captured the shock structures in the under-expanded regions which
were not reported experimentally. Liu et al. [142] first reported high-
resolution numerical simulations of direct release from high-pressure
hydrogen tank into the air using 2D axisymmetric Euler equations
with a chemical mechanism consisting of 9 species and 18 elementary
reactions to simulate H2-air combustion. However, as the viscosity
of the fluid is neglected in the Euler equations, such approach is
deemed not suitable. Subsequent researches have however, opted for
the full Navier–Stokes equations. Wen and co-workers [144–146] de-
veloped an implicit large eddy simulation (LES) approach to study the
underlying physics of spontaneous ignition in pressurized hydrogen
release. They used a 21-step kinetic scheme for describing combustion
chemistry [165]. Ultra-fine meshes were used to reduce false numerical
diffusion. Their predictions showed that for direct release into the air,
the rupturing process of the initial pressure boundary has important
influence on the propensity of spontaneous ignition and suggested that
there would be no spontaneous ignition if the pressure boundary rup-
ture rate is below a certain threshold value. It was further demonstrated

that even if spontaneous ignition occurred when the rupture rate was
sufficiently high, the initial flame width would be narrower compared
to the sudden release case, implying that it would be challenging for
such a weak flame to be sustained when stretched by the action of flow
divergence following sprouting out from the tube. This was thought
to be likely the reason why spontaneous ignition from direct release
into the air has never been demonstrated experimentally as in practical
release scenarios, including in the laboratory, the pressure boundary
did not rupture abruptly.

Subsequent numerical studies were largely focused on releases
through a section of a tube. The numerical simulations of Wen et al.
[144], as shown in Figs. 13 and 14, illustrated the evolution of the
initial generation of the leading curvilinear shock at the front of the
jet, formation of the Mach shock inside the expanded hydrogen, propa-
gation of the leading shock and its reflection by the wall as well as the
converging of the reflected transverse shock waves at the axial line and
then back toward the wall. Such a process repeats itself several times.

The initial high OH concentration and high temperature regions were
found to be near the tube wall. The simulations as shown in Fig. 14
also captured the glinting flamelets observed along the boundary layer
by Kim et al. [158] and the predicted shock velocities are also in the
same range. However, such agreement should only be considered as
qualitative as they were conducted several years before the experi-
ments with different tube diameter/lengths and under different release
pressure. Xu et al. [145] numerically simulated pressurized hydrogen
release at 100 and 300 bar through a hole of diameter D onto a flat
disk placed at distances of 1D, 2D and 3D from the exit. Their detailed
predictions revealed that the obstacle plate can either enhance the
thin flame following spontaneous ignition before the impingement of
the jet, or promote spontaneous ignition within the stagnation region.
However, in both cases, the flame cannot survive the strong secondary
flow divergence originating from the edge of the obstacle plate [145].
These experimental and numerical results together suggest that the
required shock focusing is strongly dependent on the actual geometric
arrangement.

The sprouting out of the jet flame from the tube and the mechanism
for its subsequent extinguishing or sustained development into a jet
flame have been investigated both experimentally and numerically.
An example is shown in Fig. 15 from the LES simulations of Bra-
gin and Molkov [149] using general-purpose CFD package FLUENT.
Combustion was modeled using the eddy-dissipation-concept model
by Magnussen [169] with the 21-step chemical reaction mechanism
of Gutheil et al. [170]. The grid resolution ranged from 250 μm to
10 mm. The relatively coarse grids could potentially lead to inaccurate
prediction of spontaneous ignition due to false numerical diffusion.
Nevertheless, the predicted flame separation phenomena, as shown on
the left frame of Fig. 15, was qualitatively in line with the experimental
observation of Mogi et al. [136]. Also shown are the authors’ numer-
ical predictions, revealing the vortex ring near the nozzle. Following
sprouting out from the tube, the flame was almost quenched due to
strong divergence and convection in the region between the nozzle
and the Mach disk which appeared at t=100 μs. However, the flame
kernels appeared at the Mach disk. This was attributed to reignition
or further development of the remaining weak flame kernel due to the
high stagnation temperature of the under-expanded subsonic hydrogen
jet.

Comments on the modeling approaches and state of validation:
Despite the above-mentioned efforts, sound validation of detailed
numerical simulations with sufficient fine grid resolutions for the same
conditions as those used in the experiments [138,158,166] are still
missing. Additionally, as shown in Table 4, a range of grid resolutions
were used by different investigators. To capture the evolution from
spontaneous ignition to jet flame or directly simulate the jet flame us-
ing prescribed boundary conditions, some investigators used relatively
coarse grids with the minimum resolution being around 450 μm [149,
150,161], it is unlikely that such resolutions can resolve the shock
structures responsible for spontaneous ignition and under-expanded jet
flames. For the latter, alternative approach of using notional nozzles
will be discussed in Section 3.

To limit the length of the manuscript, readers should refer to the
original references for details of the governing equations, modeling pa-
rameters, and assumptions. Some general comments are included here.

The DNS studies of Terashima et al. [139] demonstrated the effect
of initial diaphragm shape on spontaneous ignition of high-pressure
hydrogen in a two-dimensional duct while DNS of Yamada et al. [143]
showed the formation of a semi-spherical shock wave in the ambient air
at the early time of jetting. Their predictions captured the spontaneous
ignition of the hydrogen both inside the tube as well as at the tube
exit depending on the release pressure and tube length. Further CFD
studies were also conducted to investigate the effect of tube length, tube
internal structure [145,146,149,150] on the propensity of spontaneous
ignition occurrence and its subsequent evolution.

Some experimental and numerical studies also considered the ad-
dition of other gases, like methane and nitrogen, to hydrogen [166],
diaphragm rupturing conditions [139,156,160,166,167] as well as the
influence of oxidants (air, pure oxygen and pure nitrous oxide at
atmospheric pressure [168].

being smeared by numerical diffusion, ILES, which is also referred
to as Pseudo DNS, are generally necessary with high-order numerical
schemes. Commons features of the modeling approaches include:

• Full Navier–Stokes equations incorporating molecular diffusion,
e.g., a mixture-averaged multi-component approach for accu-
rate treatment of molecular transport with consideration of ther-
mal diffusion, which is important for non-premixed hydrogen
combustion.

• Detailed chemistry in the form of reduced kinetic schemes [165],

is essential.

• Diffusion in the contact region is a slow process. Explicitly cal-
culate physical diffusion in this region requires the use of high-
order numerical schemes and ultra-fine meshes in order to re-
duce numerical diffusion [142–146]. For spatial accuracy, higher-
order numerical schemes to reduce the numerical dissipation
and capture shock waves. Those used by previous authors have
included:

– Weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme (WENO) [171],

Wen and co-workers [144–146] used 5th order.

– The monotone upstream centered schemes for conservation

law (MUSCL) [139].

– Yamada et al. [143] used the second-order explicit Harten–
Yee non-MUSCL modified-flux type TVD scheme for the
convective terms and evaluated the viscous terms with the
standard second-order central difference formulae.

– For time integration, the third-order total variation dimin-
ishing (TVD) Runge–Kutta scheme is used. Wen and co-
authors [142–146] used the arbitrary Lagrangian and Eule-
rian (ALE) approach, which consists in solving convective

terms and the other terms separately. Each time cycle is
divided into two phases: a Lagrangian phase and a rezone
phase. Given the large difference of scale between diffusion
and advection, the two phases were handled with different
numerical schemes. In the Lagrangian phase, the diffusion
and pressure terms were treated with a second-order Crank–
Nicolson scheme, whereas a 3rd-order TVD Runge–Kutta
method was utilized in the rezone phase for solving the con-
vection terms. Yamada et al. [143] used the second-order
Strang-type fractional step method.

• To help reducing the computational costs, most authors exploited
the symmetric nature of the problem by conducting 2D simula-
tions.

• The current computing power renders it not feasible to capture
the whole process of spontaneous ignition and external flame in
the same simulation with sufficiently fine grid resolutions.

• Given the demanding requirement for grid resolution and higher
order numerical schemes, commercial CFD codes based on the
porosity density concept and embedded coefficients tuned from
large-scale experimental data for explosions, are not suitable for
simulating spontaneous ignition. Their use in simulating ignited
hydrogen releases either in the form of jet flames or explosions
will be discussed in Sections Sections 3 and 4. In such situations,
ignition is typically started by imposing a hot region.

2.5. Ignition by hot surfaces

Ignition by a hot surface constitutes a potential hazard in many
industrial settings, including nuclear plants, chemical processes, mines,

19

and commercial aviation [172–174]. Examples of hot surfaces include
mechanical spark formed during material handling, i.e., milling, cut-
ting, drilling, etc; radiant panels of heating devices; hot surfaces formed
by electrical heating of conducting elements; etc. Hot surface ignition
has been studied for many years with, for example, the pioneering
studies of Coward and Guest in 1927 [175], Silver in 1937 [176],
and Paterson in 1939 and 1940 [177,178]. Recent works on the topic
include extensive experimental and numerical studies performed at
the California Institute of Technology [86,172,179–189], the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology [190–194], and Peking University [195–197].
Under most conditions, hot surface ignition can be essentially con-
sidered as a non-adiabatic auto-ignition process. Among the many
aspects that influence hot surface ignition, two parameters should be
emphasized, (i) the size of the hot surface; and (ii) whether the hot
surface is stationary or in motion (or whether external flow is enforced
with respect to a stationary hot surface). Because of the very large
temperature dependence of the ignition delay-time for hydrogen–air
mixtures, ignition at low temperature by an extended hot surface, such
as a heated vessel [172], is usually not relevant for these mixtures.
On the other end, ignition by a localized or concentrated hot surface,
such as a small hot sphere, in the high-temperature regime has been
widely studied. In the following, we summarize first the papers in
which various stationary hot surfaces have been employed. Second, we
present the results obtained for moving hot surfaces. Third, we briefly
discuss some aspects specific to ignition over catalytic surfaces. In most
papers we are presenting, the hot surface is made of a non-combustible
material, that is, a material whose ignition temperature is significantly
higher than the surface temperature required to ignite hydrogen–air
or hydrogen–oxygen mixtures. For such materials, the surface might
be classified as reactive or non-reactive depending on whether surface
reactions take place or not.

2.5.1. Ignition by stationary hot surfaces

Rapidly heated wires with diameter on the order of 1 mm or lower
have been employed in several studies to investigate the hot surface
ignition phenomenon. Stout and Jones [198] employed nichrome wires
with diameters in the range 11 to 43 μm and a length of 1.5 mm to ignite
a mixture containing 20% of hydrogen in air. The wires were heated
for periods of 1 to 60 ms and the energy provided was in the range
2.8–38.5 mJ. It was found that ignition was always occurring whatever
the energy deposited was. Ashman and Buchler [199] employed rapidly
heated wires to study the ignition temperature and ignition delay of
stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixtures. The effects of wire size, in the
range 25-50 μm, material, tungsten and platinum, and gas pressure,
from 25 to 101 kPa, were investigated. The ignition delay-time as a
function of wire temperature could be well fitted with an Arrhenius
law. At a fixed wire temperature, the ignition delay-time increases
as the wire diameter or the gas pressure were reduced. Finally, they
reported that a 50 K higher temperature is required to reach a given
ignition delay-time value when using platinum instead of tungsten.
Buckel and Chandra [200] experimentally investigated the ignition of
hydrogen–oxygen mixtures by hot wires. The experiments covered a
range of gas compositions across the flammability limits and initial
gas pressures from 101 to 1100 kPa. The nichrome wires had a length
of 40 mm and a diameter of 0.20 mm and were heated at a rate of
2000–3000 K/s. At 101 kPa, the ignition threshold varied between
1177 K for 20% H2 and 1538 K for 10% H2. As the pressure was
increased from 101 to 1100 kPa, a small decrease of the ignition
threshold by approximately 50 K was observed. Buckel and Chandra
also proposed a simple model following the rationale of the original
model proposed by Laurendeau [201]. While the model reasonably
captured the variation of ignition temperature with composition, it
significantly over-predicted the decrease of the ignition temperature
with pressure observed experimentally.

Ignition by laser-heated spherical particles suspended in explo-
sives gaseous mixtures has been employed in several studies. Zhang

et al. [202] and Hills et al. [203] studied the ignition of hydrogen–air
mixtures by inert and reactive particles held at the tip of an optical
fiber. In Zhang et al. [202], sand and coal particles with a diameter
in the range 19-375 μm were employed. The core diameter of the
optical fiber was 50, 62.5, or 100 μm. They observed that the critical
power for ignition to take place generally increased as the particle
size and fiber core size were increased. A U-shape curve of the critical
optical power was observed as the concentration of hydrogen in air
was increased from 5 to 25%. The minimum was located around 10%–
15% of hydrogen. The utilization of coal particles resulted in lower
critical optical power than the utilization of inert sand particles. A
mathematical model describing the transient boundary layer around
a particle, and accounting for gas-phase and surface reactions was
shown to reproduce satisfactorily the experimental results. They also
noted that both continuous and pulsed modes could lead to ignition.
The study of Hills et al. [203] extended the parameter space used
by Zhang et al. with particle diameters up to 500 μm and different
materials employed including cotton wool, manganese dioxide, steel
wool, coal, and rock. Similar trends as in Zhang et al. were observed.
Beyer and Markus [204] used inert iron oxide spheres with diameters
of 0.5 to 1 mm. The initial temperature was 325 K and the initial
pressure was atmospheric. Mixtures with 5 to 30% of hydrogen in air
were utilized. For the smallest spheres, the ignition threshold reported
was between 1260 and 1360 K for the lowest and highest content
of hydrogen, respectively. For the largest spheres, a complex evolu-
tion was observed: the threshold drops from 1130 K to 1050 as the
hydrogen content is increased from 5 to 15%, and then increases to
1100 K for a hydrogen content of 30%. Roth et al. [190] investigated
the effects of the sphere diameter and of the surface material. They
employed two-color pyrometry to measure the sphere surface tem-
perature and high-speed chemiluminescence imaging to monitor the
ignition event. The hydrogen content was varied between 5 and 85%
in air. Spheres with a diameter in the range 0.3–0.8 mm and made of
different materials (silicon nitride, nickel-supported tungsten carbide,
steel types 1.3505, 1.3541, and 1.4034, casting steel, and aluminum)
were impulsively heated by a laser beam. Given the large number of
experimental configurations employed by Roth et al. we only detail
some representative results and additional results are shown in Fig. 16.
Considering a sphere diameter of 0.8 mm, the ignition threshold was
in the range 1070–1180 K, for hydrogen contents in the range 10%–
60%, ambient temperature and pressure, and Si3N4 (inert) as the sphere
material. As the material was changed to steel 1.3541 (reactive), the
ignition threshold increased to 1170–1330 K, for hydrogen contents of
5 to 65%. Further study by Roth et al. [191] confirmed these results
and also led to the establishment of a correlation between the laminar
flame speed and the ignition threshold.

Beyer and Markus [204], Roth et al. [190], Haber et al. [192],
and Wang and Chen [195] employed a relatively similar numerical
approach to simulate hot surface ignition by spherical particles. A
spherical hot surface is placed at the center of a 1D spherical chamber.
Detailed gas-phase chemistry and transport were considered. Beyer
and Markus [204] showed that the evolution of the ignition threshold
with particle diameter exhibits two asymptotes. At small diameter,
the ignition threshold increases very strongly as the sphere diameter
is reduced, forming a vertical asymptote. For a diameter larger than
5 mm, the ignition threshold essentially plateaus around 950 K, forming
a horizontal asymptote. Roth et al. [190] investigated the effects of
particle size and material. The heat transfer by radiation from the solid
to the gas phase was described using the Stefan–Boltzmann’s law. Only
the difference in thermal properties of the materials were accounted
for and surface chemistry was not included. While their simulation
results could reproduce most of the trends observed experimentally,
i.e., increased ignition threshold with the increase of hydrogen content
and the decrease of the particle size, the effect of the change of material
could not be well captured. The authors attributed this discrepancy to
the absence of surface reactions in the simulations. Haber et al. [192]

performed a comprehensive parametric study and investigated the
effects of stoichiometry, heating rate, particle size, and radical surface
destruction efficiencies. They employed the same approach as Roth
et al. [190] but the surface reactions were accounted for. The trans-
port of energy inside the solid sphere was also modeled. The ignition
threshold as a function of equivalence ratio was well reproduced and
exhibited a U-shaped profile with higher threshold for very lean and
very rich mixtures. They found that for large enough heating rates,
i.e., above 1000 K/s, no significant effect of this parameter on the
ignition threshold was observed. For a stoichiometric H2-air mixture,
they reported an increase of the surface temperature at ignition from
approximately 1000 K to above 1200 K, as the diameter of the sphere
was decreased from 1 to 0.1 mm. Concerning the effect of surface
reactions, they considered a range of values for the surface destruction
efficiencies in the range 0–0.01, and found that the ignition threshold
could be increased by up to 100 K. They compared the results obtained
using the 1D approach to results of 2D simulations and found an overall
agreement despite the higher complexity of the 2D flow field. In the
2D simulations, ignition was observed to always take place just above
the top surface of the sphere, consistent with other 2D simulations
made with a glow plug as the hot surface [86,185,186]. Wang and
Chen [195] studied the effects of particle size and temperature on
the ignition delay-time. They reported that both parameters strongly
influence the ignition delay-time, which is much longer under this 1D
situation than the 0D adiabatic delay-time at the same gas temperature.
This difference was attributed to diffusion-induced radical losses. They
underlined that the hot surface ignition can be characterized by a
Damköhler number defined as the ratio of the characteristics time of
diffusion to the characteristics time of reaction. It is also noted that
Wang et al. [197] recently performed an eigenvalue analysis which
enables to determine the critical Damköhler number for hot surface
ignition.

Several studies [86,185,186] employed a commercial glow plug,
Autolite 1110 with a height of 9.3 mm and a diameter of 5.1 mm,
as the hot surface and combined two-color pyrometry and interfer-
ometry to monitor the surface temperature and the gas temperature,
respectively. Melguizo-Gavilanes et al. [86] studied the effect of heating
rate on the hot surface ignition threshold for the stoichiometric H2–air
mixture at T1 = 300 K and p1 = 101 kPa. They measured 1052 ± 52
K and 1028 ± 53 K for heating rates of the hot surface of 18 and
190 K/s, respectively. Mevel et al. [185] further studied the effect
of heating rate on the ignition threshold. They used H2-air mixtures
containing 5 to 74% of hydrogen at T 1 = 300 K and p1 = 101 kPa.
The experimental threshold increased from 1010 K for a concentration
of H2 of 5%, to 1170 K for 74% H2. The heating rate of the hot
surface was varied in the range 60–180 K/s and the measurement of

the ignition threshold confirmed a limited impact of approximately
2.5%, the threshold being lower for large heating rate. On the other
hand, Mevel et al. reported that ignition on the side of glow plug
could occur when fast heating of the hot surface was employed, which
could lead to inaccurate measurement of the ignition threshold. Boeck
et al. [186] further investigated the dynamics of hot surface ignition
in the vicinity of the lower flammability limit. For hydrogen content
of 5%, they reported an unusual behavior referred to as ‘‘single puff’’.
Such a phenomenon corresponds to a single ignition event with the
formation of an ignition kernel confined in the close vicinity of the hot
surface. At later time, the top portion of the flame is detached from
the top surface and the formation of a thermal plume with continuous
chemical activity occurs; no flame propagation in the lateral direction
is taking place. Experimental evidence is lacking to determine if the
hot plume of products may act as an ignition source for more reactive
regions of a combustible cloud of a stratified H2-air mixture above the
hot surface.

In [86,185,186], axi-symmetric 2D numerical studies were also
performed with detailed chemistry [92]. It was shown that the most
likely location for ignition to take place is at the top of the glow
plug, slightly above its surface. As the buoyancy driven flow induced
by the hot surface heating of the gas separates around this location,
a stagnant volume of gas is formed. The appearance of the critical
conditions for ignition to take place is favored due to minimized
convective losses and maximized heat diffusion from the hot surface.
Chain-branching reactions become increasingly important as compared
to reactions forming peroxides for temperatures above 900–1000 K. A
sharp decrease in ignition delay time is hence expected with increasing
surface temperature, which would facilitate ignition when the ignition
delay-time and gas residence time near the hot surface become compa-
rable. In [185], the side ignition event observed experimentally could
be reproduced by imposing a hot spot on the side of the simulated
glow plug. It was also shown that only simulations performed using
the detailed reaction model of Hong et al. [63] could reproduced the
increase of the ignition threshold with the increase of the hydrogen
content. The effect of chemistry at the hot surface wall was estimated
by imposing destruction of intermediate species as they contact with
the surface. The removal of H and HO2 radicals at the wall induced an
increase of the ignition thresholds by up to 45 K for a hydrogen content
of 70%. In [186], the single puff phenomenon was further investigated
using numerical simulations. The thermal plume is composed of two
main regions: (i) an isothermal core surrounded by a reaction zone with
large concentrations of H, O, and OH; and (ii) a broad outer region
characterized by high concentrations of HO2 and H2O2. The authors
further break down the single puff event into four phases: (i) primary
ignition at the top of the glow plug; (ii) formation of an anchored

21

reaction zone at the top of the glow plug and of a thermal plume, the
reaction zone is fed by fresh gas traveling along the side of the glow
plug whereas the plume is filled with hot products; (iii) as the ratio
of the convective to chemical time-scale decreases, the fresh mixture
is consumed as it travels along the side of the glow plug, which leads
to the detachment of the reaction zone; and (iv) chemical activity is
displaced into the plume and sustained by radial diffusion of reactants.
Heated rods or cylinders were employed in several studies. Adomeit
[206] used rapidly heated chromium–nickel rods to study the hot
surface ignition of hydrogen–air mixtures in the pressure range 45–
560 kPa. The rods were 3–4 mm in diameter with a length of 35 mm.
The temperature field was monitored using a Mach–Zehnder interfer-
ometer. For a mixture with equivalence ratio of 0.9 at initial pressure
of 100 kPa, Adomeit reports an ignition delay-time of 6.4 ms for a
surface temperature of 1013 K. Large scatter in the measurements
were observed. The author emphasized that ignition takes place as the
temperature gradient becomes small enough. Kumar [205] used four
stainless steel rods to study hot surface ignition of H2-air and H2-O2-He
mixtures. The 20 cm long and 8 mm in diameter rods were placed in a
vertical position and heated at a rate of 5 K/s. The surface temperature
was monitored using thermocouples strapped to the hot surfaces. An
ignition threshold around 930 K and independent of the hydrogen con-
tent in the range 10 to 50% in air was reported. For mixtures containing
He, the ignition threshold appears to be few tens of K higher but is also
independent of equivalence ratio. These results tend to demonstrate the
importance of the surface area and residence time since only Kumar
observed ignition at temperatures below 950 K, despite the dramatic
increase of the ignition delay-time around this limiting temperature.
Kumar also employed a 1D numerical model, which considers detailed
chemistry and could satisfactorily reproduced the measured ignition
threshold. The stationary hot surface ignition experiment employed
in [86,185,186] was improved by Boeck et al. [183] by using an in-
house hot cylinder instead of a commercial glow plug. The hot cylinder
approach includes two major advantages over the glow plug setting:
(i) higher temperature homogeneity could be achieved; and (ii) the
hot cylinder could be positioned horizontally or vertically, allowing
studying the effect of the hot surface orientation. Similar conditions as
in [185] were employed. Fig. 17 shows that for a horizontal cylinder,
ignition is taking place in a stagnant gas region at the top of the
cylinder. In the case of a vertical orientation, such stagnation point does
not exist and, at the threshold, ignition is observed to take place close
to the end of the hot section of the cylinder. Nevertheless, no significant
difference between the horizontal and vertical orientation could be
observed for hydrogen–air mixtures in terms of ignition threshold.
Boeck et al. studied the temporal and spatial development of thermal
boundary layers and performed an analysis of the heat transfer. They
found that ignition is promoted in regions of long residence time and of
shallow temperature gradient, which also correspond to regions where
the thermal boundary layer is thick. This analysis was completed by the
utilization of the ignition threshold scaling law of Laurendeau [201]
which showed that the ignition threshold for hydrogen–air mixtures
demonstrate a low sensitivity to the Nusselt number, and thus to the
cylinder orientation, in the vicinity of the extended second-explosion
limit.

Mevel et al. [185] summarized the experimental data of several
studies on ignition by stationary hot surface, see Fig. 16. The data ex-
tend over the range of temperature 900–1400 K for hydrogen contents
between 5 and 73%. The variation of the ignition threshold can be
attributed to the effects of equivalence ratio, hot surface size, nature of
the hot surface material, characteristics of the flow field, and possibly
to the experimental technique. While several studies [131,183,185]
reported that the ignition of lean mixtures was easier than the ignition
of stoichiometric and rich mixtures, other studies reported a weak
dependence on equivalence ratio [205] or an opposite trend [204]. The
interpretation of the effect of equivalence ratio is complicated by the
effect of the hot surface size and material. In most cases, the decrease

of the hot surface size induces an increase of the ignition threshold. For
sub-millimeter hot sphere, an exponential increase of the threshold is
predicted by 1D simulation as the sphere diameter is decreased [204].
The specific chemical activity at the surface may modify the ignition
threshold by promoting radical formation, for example through the
reaction H2O2=2OH, or by promoting radical recombination, for ex-
ample through the reaction H+OH=H2O. Depending on the heating
rate, the flow field created around the hot surface can influence the
ignition dynamics, at least qualitatively [185]. Finally, the technique
for monitoring the hot surface ignition can also lead to significant
discrepancies; in particular, Mevel et al. [185] raised a number of issues
associated with the use of thermocouple.

2.5.2. Ignition by moving hot surfaces

Significantly fewer studies were performed for moving hot surface
and the very large majority of them employed spheres as the hot
surface. Before further detailing the studies on ignition by moving
spheres, we introduce some studies on the ignition of flowing gas
mixtures by a hot foil or a hot coiled wire.

Morreale et al. [207] used thin carbon steel plates, 4 mm by 0.4 mm,
or AISI 302 steel coiled wires, 34 mm in length and 0.25 mm in
diameter, placed in a tubular reactor made of quartz or sapphire. They
employed an IR-sensitive camera to monitor the temperature of the
hot foil. For the experiments performed with the foil, the mixtures
contained 5.7 or 6.5% of hydrogen in air and the flow rate was 50
or 100 ml/min. The ignition threshold of 1093 K measured for 5.7%
H2 and a flow rate of 100 ml/min decreases to 1033 K for 6.5% H2
and a flow rate of 100 ml/min, and to 993 K for 6.5% H2 and a flow
rate of 50 ml/min. For the experiments performed with the wire, the
hydrogen content was 5 or 10% and the residence time was 7 s. While
no ignition took place, significant conversion of H2 was observed for
temperatures above approximately 750 K and was attributed to surface
reactions. Wang et al. [208] studied the ignition of a jet of hydrogen
by a hot surface. The dominant parameters for ignition to occur was
the temperature of the hot surface, while the surface roughness as well
as the angle between the jet and the hot surface did not modify the
critical surface temperature measured to be 883–893 K.

Silver [176] studied the ignition by moving hot spherical particles
of a mixture containing 20% of hydrogen in air. The particles had a
diameter of 1.7 to 5.5 mm, a velocity in the range 2–5 m/s, and were
made of either quartz or platinum. A pyrometer was employed to mea-
sure the sphere surface temperature. The ignition threshold was around
1070 and 1200 K for the largest and smallest spheres, respectively.
Silver’s results indicate that, while the ignition temperature seemed
slightly higher for spheres made of platinum, the particle material had
a limited impact. The dominant parameters that control the occurrence
of ignition appeared to be the size and temperature of the hot sphere.
The velocity of the particles was not systematically reported. Silver
emphasized that the hot surface ignition threshold is much higher than
the auto-ignition temperature. Paterson [178] performed experiments
similar to those of Silver but characterized the velocity of the hot
sphere. In addition, a wide variety of materials were used. In many
experiments, the sphere velocity was 1.2 m/s. For a mixture containing
10% H2 in air, Paterson measured an ignition threshold on the order
of 100 K lower as compared to Silver’s values for a hydrogen content
of 20% and a sphere velocity of 4 m/s. Paterson also reported an
approximately 50 to 60 K higher threshold for spheres made of polished
platinum as compared to the other materials, considered as inert.
The effect of surface aging was investigated; for quartz spheres, aging
could lead to 15–20 K higher ignition threshold, whereas for platinum
spheres, aging could lead to 50–60 K lower threshold. More recently,
Jones et al. [187] studied the ignition of H2-O2-N2 mixtures by moving
hot spheres. They employed mixtures with different equivalence ratios,
Φ = 0.39–1.35, and dilutions levels, xN2 = 0.5–0.8, keeping the laminar
flame speed roughly constant around 35 cm/s. The sphere surface
temperature was monitored using two-color pyrometry whereas the

The interferometric imaging enabled to measure the gas temperature
within the boundary layer around the sphere and showed that, at the
threshold, ignition is taking place in the vicinity of the separation
region, consistent with the predictions of numerical simulations.

Melguizo-Gavilanes et al. [182] performed 2D numerical simula-
tions of ignition by falling hot spheres. The simulations include detailed
transport and chemistry. A stoichiometric H2-air mixture at 300 K
and 101 kPa was considered. Because the simulations closely followed
the experiments by Coronel et al. [184] and Jones et al. [187], a
nitrogen boundary layer is initially present around the sphere. The
reactive mixture has to diffuse into this boundary layer before chemical
reaction can be activated, which significantly delays ignition. Melguizo-
Gavilanes et al. studied the ignition dynamics as the sphere temperature
was progressively increased in consecutive simulations. In the close
vicinity of the ignition threshold, ignition is taking place within the
volume of gas adjacent to the flow separation region. For higher sphere
temperatures, the ignition location moves closer and closer to the
front stagnation point. It was also shown that the dominant chemistry
changes from chain branching to linear chain, as the temperature of
the sphere is decreased. Using the same model, Melguizo-Gavilanes
et al. [181] further studied the effect of differential diffusion on the
numerical predictions. They considered non-unity Lewis numbers and
differential diffusion. The predicted ignition threshold was found to
increase by 40 K when preferential diffusion was considered. A sen-
sitivity study revealed the diffusion of H atoms had an important role
to prevent ignition at temperatures below 1000 K. Zirwes et al. [193]
performed 2D and 3D numerical simulations of ignition by moving
hot sphere and studied the effect of mixture composition and sphere
velocity on the ignition threshold and ignition location. An example
of simulation result is shown in Fig. 19. They found that the ignition
threshold increased by 60–70 K as the equivalence ratio was increased
from Φ = 0.26–4.42. As the sphere velocity was increased from 0 to
30 m/s, the ignition threshold was increased by approximately 70 K.
The location of ignition at the threshold was found to move from the
rear stagnation point to the separation point as velocity was increased.
It is noted that 3D effects were observed only at large sphere velocity,
i.e., above 5 m/s.

Melguizo-Gavilanes and Shepherd [209] studied the effect of rota-
tion on the ignition threshold by a hot horizontal cylinder. The ignition
threshold varies within a range of approximately 10 K as the rotation
speed is varied from 0 to 480 rad/s. This study confirmed that ignition
is favored in regions of shallow temperature gradients.

2.5.3. Ignition by catalytic surfaces

According to Lewis and von Elbe [83], hot surface ignition is pro-
moted by a non-catalytic surface as compared to a catalytic surface. The

diameter moving hot sphere and experimental and numerical ignition thresholds for

gas temperature was measured using interferometry. For each set of
conditions, a large number of experiments were made and a statistical
analysis was performed. The results of such an analysis are shown in
Fig. 18 along with the evolution of the ignition threshold as a function
of equivalence ratio. Considering a confidence interval of 95%, the
uncertainty on the measured ignition threshold was from ±20 to ±43
K. The minimum temperatures for ignition to take place were 963, 999,
and 1007 K, for mixtures with Φ = 0.39, 1, and 1.35, respectively.

difference between these two kinds of surfaces is attributed to a favored
radical quenching at the surface for catalytic material. As detailed in
the previous sections, in most studies in which the effect of surface
material on hot surface ignition has been investigated, a higher ignition
threshold was reported, see for example [190,192,204]. In few studies,
as the one of Silver [176], no significant differences were observed for
the ignition threshold measured for quartz and platinum moving hot
particles. Few studies reported a promoting effect of catalytic surface.
For example, Cho and Law [210] measured an ignition temperature of
343 K for hydrogen–air mixtures flowing over wires made of platinum.
As pointed out by Haber et al. [192], the effect of catalytic surface is
usually on the same order of magnitude as the experimental uncertainty
on the ignition threshold, so that it is difficult to accurately quantify the
contribution of surface chemistry.

While a complete analysis of the literature on surface chemistry
under combustion relevant conditions would be of significant inter-
est, it is beyond the scope of the present review to address such a
wide topic. Nevertheless, we found important to briefly point out the
potential ignition risk by Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs),
which are employed to recombine hydrogen with oxygen during severe
accident in nuclear power plants, thus potentially mitigating the acci-
dental combustion in the confinement building. Typically, a catalyst
supported onto a layer of ceramic material is employed to form steam
from gaseous hydrogen and oxygen. Because of the energy released
during the catalytic process, 242 kJ/mol, the surface of the catalytic
recombiner can heat up and lead to ignition. Several studies have been
performed to determine the ignition characteristics of PARs. One such
study corresponds to the investigation by Chakraborty et al. [212] who
used a flow reactor equipped with a platinum catalytic bed represen-
tative of the PARs used in nuclear plants. The gas concentrations of
H2 and O2 were monitored and an IR camera enabled to measured
the catalytic surface temperature. A parametric study was performed to
determine the effects of the inlet gas velocity and temperature, of the
separation distance between the catalytic layers, and of the hydrogen
content. Under all conditions, the increase of the hydrogen content
leds to an increase of the surface temperature. The increase of the
inlet flow velocity and decrease of the separation distance induced a
faster rate of temperature increase as xH2 was ramped up. The inlet gas
temperature appeared unimportant. The surface temperature at ignition
was in the range 1233–1273 K. A number of numerical studies relevant
to ignition by PARs were performed using the SPARK code [96,211],
which considers the 2D Navier–Stokes equations with multi-component

transport and Soret effect, as well as gas-phase detailed kinetics and
surface chemistry over a Pt surface. Meynet and Bentaib [96] char-
acterized the operating regimes of the PARs for H2-air mixtures by
analyzing the homogeneous and heterogeneous heat release rates. For
a hydrogen content below 5.4%, the PARs operate within the purely
catalytic regime; the heat release from gas-phase reactions is zero while
that from the surface reactions increases with XH2. In the transition
regime, ignition in the gas-phase is taking place but the catalytic
activity is not fully suppressed; as xH2 is increased, the heat release
in the gas increases while the heat release at the surface decreases,
and these two parameters are related by a linear relationship. For
a hydrogen content above 10%, the catalytic activity is almost fully
suppressed and the gas-phase heat release increases with XH2; this is the
gaseous regime. Also studied were the effect of oxygen starvation and
water vapor concentration on the catalyst activity and the combustion
characteristics [211]. Fig. 20 shows an example of the simulated 2D
fields of temperature, H2 conversion efficiency, and OH mole fraction,
for various oxygen to nitrogen ratios. Under dry conditions, Meynet
et al. calculated an ignition temperature of 1143 K, in close agreement
with the experimental value of 1173 K. With a water vapor content
of 40%, the hydrogen and oxygen mole fractions required for ignition
to take place increased approximately from 5.8 to 6.5%, and from 7 to
8%, respectively. This is consistent with previous results of Meynet and
Bentaib [96]. The ignition domain significantly shrinks as the oxygen
content decreases. More recent simulations could reproduce all the
trends observed experimentally by Chakraborty et al. [212], but the
ignition threshold was under-estimated by approximately 10%.

2.6. Ignition by electric and laser sparks

Electric spark can be created at the surface of fabrics, in electrical
appliances, by interaction of charged dust particles, etc. While ignition
by an electric spark constitutes a commonly observed event, ignition by
a laser spark would be much less frequent. Nevertheless, mal-function
of a laser system could constitute a plausible scenario leading to un-
controlled ignition. Electric and laser spark ignition demonstrate a
number of similarities and constitute a very complex interplay between
plasma and chemical kinetics, and fluid mechanics [213]. Experimental
investigations of spark kernels as well as their transition to flames
are complex because of very short process times, and extremely high
core temperature and pressure, i.e., respectively up to 50,000 K and
10 MPa [214]. To assess the risk of ignition by an electric or laser

24

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

is a reactive gas mixture, ignition may occur. Spark ignition is a very
complex process which is strongly impacted by the spark dynamics and
the geometry of the electrodes [216].

2.6.1.1. Electric spark dynamics in non-reactive media. To differentiate
the effects due to the formation and evolution of the spark kernel and
those related to reactive flow dynamics, some studies have focused on
spark in non-reactive media. Experimental, theoretical, and numerical
studies have been performed to gain insights into this complex phe-
nomenon and determine the effects of various parameters such as the
electrode geometry, gap, and size. The quasi-instantaneous release of
the electrical energy within the electrode gap leads to the formation of a
high-temperature, high-pressure kernel. Experimental work has shown
that the kernel is under a non-equilibrium state with important vibra-
tional excitation [217]. The early flow field structure dominates the
shape and dynamics of the plasma kernel at later stage [218]. The rapid
expansion of the gas within the kernel leads to the formation of a shock
wave that is spherical near the electrode’s surface and cylindrical in the
electrode’s gap [216]. The competition between cylindrical and spher-
ical expansion leads to the formation of a hydrodynamic puff/jet [219,
220], with vorticity generation at the location of maximum shock
front curvature [215]. The complex flow field created by the diverging
shock wave leads to the formation of counter-rotating vortex pairs
which bring the cold gas into motion and induce the detachment
of high-temperature lobes outside of the spark gap, resulting in the
formation of a torus-like hot kernel [221,222]. The interaction between
the hot gas exiting the electrode gap with the colder gas outside of
it limits the growth of the plasma kernel. The region of maximum
temperature is shifted from the center of the spark gap to the ring of
the torus [221]. Because of the competition between the cylindrical
and spherical expansion, the geometry and size of the electrodes have
a dominant impact on the kernel dynamics [221,223]. Akram [218]
reported that the number of pair of counter-rotating vortices and their
detailed structures, can be significantly different. Kono et al. [221]
reported that for a large electrode gap, a non-toroidal hot kernel could
be formed. For a larger electrode diameter, the toroidal shape of the
hot kernel could be maintained but the formation of a stagnant and
hot region between the electrodes was induced, potentially resulting
in ignition quenching [221]. While some numerical studies [221] have
considered the hot kernel as a non-reactive medium, others [218] have
taken into account the effects of dissociation, ionization, and the vibra-
tional temperature. In general, the simulations can capture reasonably
well the main features of the spark ignition process. Reinmann and
Akram [223] indicated that their two-dimensional simulations could
reproduce rather well the shape of the plasma kernel, the shock wave
trajectory, as well as the temperature and density profiles. On the other
hand, discrepancies were observed for the energy provided to the gas.
Ekici et al. [222] performed two-dimensional simulation of electric
spark in air using several thermodynamic models of different complex-
ity. Despite the different expressions employed in the three models for
the equation of state and specific heat capacity, the energy deposited
and shock wave trajectory were overall consistent with experimental
results. On the other hand, the temperature profiles calculated at early
time showed some discrepancies.

2.6.1.2. Electric spark ignition. According to Chomiak [219], spark ig-
nition of combustible mixtures can be decomposed into two phases:
(i) formation of a plasma jet developing into a toroidal volume of
distributed reaction; and (ii) flame development at the border of the
reacting kernel as its rate of growth drops to below the propagation
velocity of the flame. Such a complex process has been extensively
studied in experimental and numerical investigations.

Thiele et al. [213,224,225] conducted a series of studies of spark
ignition, combining experiments and detailed 2D numerical simula-
tions. Various aspects were taken into account in their simulation,
including heat conduction from the gas to the electrodes, molecular
transport, and detailed chemistry. The coupling between gas dynamics

spark, the relevant metric is the minimum ignition energy (MIE), which
corresponds to the smallest quantity of energy required to initiate flame
propagation, and depends on a number of parameters. While other
types of electrical discharge, such as glow and corona discharge, could
potentially also lead to ignition, they were not reviewed in details. This
subsection focuses on the dynamics of spark ignition and the recent
experimental, numerical, and theoretical results on MIE.

2.6.1. Spark ignition dynamics

If the electric potential between two electrodes is above the break-
down voltage of the medium separating them, an electric spark can be
created. The rapid expansion of the gas within the plasma kernel creates
a shock wave. Following the separation of the shock wave from the hot
gas kernel, a complex flow field is established [215]. If the medium

25

and the electrical discharge properties were also accounted for through
heating by the electrical current. They performed a comprehensive
parametric study on the shape of the electrode for a mixture containing
20% H2 in air and found that the details of the flow field are signif-
icantly influenced by the geometry of the electrode’s tip. They also
investigated the shapes of the early flame kernels by monitoring OH
radicals generated during the ignition and the combustion through 2D
laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). Temperatures were measured using
coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS). They also conducted
2D simulations for initially quiescent mixtures but neglected the influ-
ence of surrounding environment and convective flows. For a central
position within the flame kernel, a ‘‘dying’’ plasma kernel was observed
but no transition to a self-sustained flame occurred since the H2-air
mixture with 5% H2 was too lean. For ignition cases, a self-sustained
flame is established after a period of 50-70 μs after arc breakdown. They
also pointed out the strong influence of the electrode geometry since
an oval and a toroidal OH kernel were obtained for sharpened and flat
electrodes tips, respectively. The numerical simulations demonstrated
qualitative agreement with the experimental results and a clear torus-
like hot kernel was observed few hundreds μs after break down, as
shown in Fig. 21. However, their numerical studies were limited to
process times up to 300 μs, covering only the early development of a
flame kernel initiated by an electrical spark.

Ono and Oda [217,226] also applied advanced diagnostics to the
study of spark ignition. They combined emission spectroscopy and OH
laser-induced predissociation fluorescence (OH-LIPF) to determine the
translational–rotational and vibrational temperatures during electrical
sparking. The OH-LIF set-up and images are shown in Fig. 22. Schlieren
visualization of the spark kernel was also performed. They found that
the rotational temperature of OH reaches approximately 850–1150 K
within 3 μs after the discharge, and attributed the gas temperature
increase to vibrational energy relaxation. The schlieren images clearly
show the formation of a cylindrical kernel at early time and its progres-
sive deformation as time increases. They found that the energy input
and the equivalence ratio have significant effect on the spark ignition.
At early time, a filament-shaped kernel is formed between the two
electrodes and is expanding outwardly with a higher velocity in the
direction perpendicular to the electrode axis. This process is influenced
by the energy input and the kernel can be more or less spherical. For
energy input much larger than the MIE, the time to flame ignition does
not depend much on the energy, while for energy input close to the
MIE, more variability is observed. The temporal evolution of the OH
density in the kernel also demonstrates important variability; it can be
almost constant for some time and then exponentially increase, or it
can decrease for a period and then increase rapidly. It is noted that
OH radicals are formed in the spark kernel even in the case of failed
ignition event. The role of heat loss to the electrodes in decreasing the
temperature in the kernel is also emphasized. If chemical heat release
is fast enough, the temperature can increase and ignition takes place.
Bane et al. [216] studied the effect of electrode geometry, including
cylindrical, conical, and flanged cylindrical, on spark ignition through
high-speed schlieren visualization and numerical simulation performed
with single-step Arrhenius chemistry and adaptive mesh refinement to
obtained highly resolved flow fluids. The electrode geometry has sig-
nificant influence on the temperature, rate of cooling of the hot kernel,
mixing region dynamics, and the ignition process. The interaction of the
nascent flame with the vortices typically formed during spark ignition
was pointed out. For the cylindrical and the conical electrode tips, very
similar features were observed. Considering a flanged electrode config-
uration, the viscous effects were found to generate a multidimensional
flow field and lead to a curved flame front; this observation was not
made in previous work due to a too low resolution of the simulations.
Under such high level of confinement, higher gas temperatures could
be generated and could lead to a lower MIE.

Essman et al. [227] and Kummer et al. [228] studied the near-
MIE spark ignition process using high-speed schlieren imaging, OH-
PLIF, and 1D numerical simulations. In both studies, they employed a

hydrogen–air mixture containing 23.3% of H2. For input energies in the
range 2.3–5.6 times the MIE, they did not detect significant differences
in the schlieren or PLIF images. The transition from a cylindrical to
a spherical/ellipsoidal, and eventually to a toroidal geometry could
be observed in both cases from the PLIF images. The main difference
was a slightly larger flame radius for the largest energy input. The
schlieren imaging showed that in all cases, a rather spherical flame was
formed after few ms. In case of successful ignition, the radial profile
of normalized LIF intensity evolves as follows: (i) at early times, a
Gaussian-like distribution centered on the center of the electrode gap
is formed; (ii) the peak value of the fluorescence intensity increases
and the profile gets larger; (iii) the Gaussian-shape eventually vanishes,
the LIF intensity in the center drops and its maximum is located at
the edges, forming a V-shaped OH kernel. If ignition is quenched, the
gaussian-like profile progressively disappears and no transition to a V-
shaped profile is observed. The V-shaped profile, which corresponds to
a slice of the toroidal hot kernel, is attributed to the rapid expansion
of the plasma kernel and to losses to the electrodes. The spark ignition
events did not demonstrate much variability. Such a behavior could be
attributed to the fact that experiments employed only input energies
much larger than the MIE.

While most studies have focused on ignition by an electric spark
generated by the discharge of a capacitor, Shekhar et al. [229] studied
the ignition of hydrogen–air mixtures by a contact arc, i.e., a low-
voltage electrical discharge generated as the distance between electrical
contacts is modified, so that contact is broken or created. Experiments
with high-speed visualization based on Mach–Zehnder interferometry
as well as numerical simulations were performed. All experiments were
performed under normal conditions of pressure and temperature. The
contact arc was created by moving linearly a tungsten electrode wire
along a cadmium block. Following ignition by the contact arc, the flame
front propagated with an approximately elliptical shape. Experimental
variability and the intrinsic statistical nature of the ignition process
prevented a quantitative determination of the ignition threshold. Com-
parison with the numerical results demonstrated reasonable qualitative
agreement although significant differences were observed for the igni-
tion delay-time. The authors mentioned that further improvement of
the discharge modeling could potentially improve the agreement with
the experimental results.

2.6.1.3. Laser spark ignition. Although the occurrence of a laser spark
cannot be completely ruled out, such an event is much less probable
than the formation of an electro-static discharge. As a consequence, we
only rapidly describe the main characteristics of the laser spark process
and point out the main difference with electric spark.

Ignition of a gaseous combustible mixture by a laser spark relies on
the formation of a high-temperature and high-pressure plasma kernel
following optical breakdown of the gas by a focused laser beam. The
expansion of the plasma kernel leads to the formation of a shock
wave which rapidly separates from the hot gas kernel. The complex
flow formed behind the shock induces the mixing of the hot gas
with the ambient mixture, which can lead to ignition under certain
conditions [230]. While the overall steps of this process appear similar
to the electrical spark case, a number of qualitative differences exist.
The plasma kernel formed at early time is typically on the order of
mm3 in volume, is rather axisymmetric about the axis of the laser beam
but non-symmetric along the laser beam direction. It has a teardrop
shape and might be idealized as two hemispherical regions of different
diameters linked to each other by a conical region. Because of the
particular shape of the plasma kernel, a teardrop-shaped shock wave
is initially formed and subsequently evolves to a spherical geometry.
The difference of shock decay rate for cylindrical and spherical shocks,
as well as the geometry evolution leads to the creation of vorticity
by the inhomogeneous strength of the curved shock and by baroclinic
torque, which results in the collapse of the teardrop kernel, and to
the formation of a toroidal region of high-temperature, and possibly

to the ejection of hot gas along the direction of the laser beam propa-
gation [230,231]. The direction of the gas jet can be either forward
or backward with respect to the laser source depending on various
parameters including the initial pressure of the mixture, the length of
the plasma kernel, and its aspect ratio [230]. Ignition may take place
either in the vicinity of the toroidal structure and/or close to the hot
gas jet. A ‘‘three-lob’’ flame may be formed as illustrated in Fig. 23.

Away from the flammability limits, the MIE obtained from a laser
spark ignition experiment is quite similar to that obtained from an
electric spark experiment. However, in the vicinity of the limits, laser
spark becomes much more effective than electric spark because of the
absence of losses to the electrodes [233]. A number of studies have
been performed on laser spark ignition using hydrogen-based mixtures.
Morsy and Chung [234] demonstrated the possibility of single-shot,
multi-point laser ignition and discussed the potential advantage of
such an approach to enhance burning of fuel-lean mixtures. Wang
et al. [235] studied the laser ignition of Ar-diluted stoichiometric
H2-O2 mixtures for various laser energies and initial sub-atmospheric
pressures of the gas. They reported a minimum ignition energy of 15
mJ. The process of flame kernel formation from the laser spark, as well
as the subsequent flame propagation were also discussed. Srivastava

et al. [236] and Dharamshi et al. [232] characterized the laser spark
ignition process in hydrogen–air mixtures and made a comparison with
electrical spark ignition. The experiments were performed in a constant
volume chamber at initial pressure of 1 or 3 MPa and initial temper-
ature in the range 323–373 K. They observed that the peak pressure
was reached after a shorter time when using a laser spark instead
of an electric spark, while the peak value was not modified. Using
high-speed shadowgraphy, they observed ignition kernel composed of
a torus-like structure and a front lobe. For the range of hydrogen
contents investigated, the minimum energy for successful ignition was
in between 10 and 15 mJ/pulse.

2.6.2. Minimum ignition energy

Pioneering studies on the determination of the MIE can be traced
back to the 1940’s and 1950’s [83,214]. While the general point of view
on spark ignition is that ignition source with an energy below the MIE
will not ignite the reactive mixture [214], more recent studies point
out a probable statistical nature of the spark ignition process.

2.6.2.1. Statistical nature of the spark ignition process. Considering that
ignition is a statistical phenomenon due to the inherent variability in

engineering test data, Bane et al. [214,237] developed a very low-
energy capacitive spark ignition system to test a range of spark energies
in lean hydrogen–oxygen–argon mixtures with hydrogen contents of 5,
6, and 7%. They used statistical tools to obtain probability distributions
for ignition versus the energy generated by sparks with varying lengths
up to 10 mm. Their results, shown in Fig. 24, suggested that ignition
is statistical in nature and highly dependent on mixture composition
and spark length; and a single threshold MIE value does not exist. The

statistical nature of spark ignition was also further discussed by the
same group [238,239] in the context of ignition tests with different
fuels and oxidants and the need for ignition probability in practical
applications.

The approach of Bane was employed more recently by other au-
thors [240]. The treatment of ignition by electric spark as a statistical
phenomenon, including an historical perspective of this approach, is
discussed at length in [214]. It is clearly demonstrated that, unlike

claimed by some authors, a statistical treatment cannot be applied to
the historical data on MIE because not enough information is provided.

2.6.2.2. Measurement of the minimum ignition energy. Under normal
conditions of pressure and temperature, the MIE of hydrogen–air mix-
tures ranges between few tens μJ around the stoichiometry and few mJ
close to the flammability limits [83,241,242]. As previously mentioned,
a number of parameters can potentially influence MIE and many studies
have been performed to quantify the impact of such effects. The poten-
tially important parameters include the fuel type, the equivalence ratio,
the dilution level, the temperature and pressure, the spark duration,
the material, surface roughness, and the geometry of the electrodes,
as well as the distance between them, whether the gas is quiescent or
in motion [240], the turbulence intensity, and the level of mixedness
between the fuel and the oxidizer.

Considering a quiescent environment, historical [83,242] and more
recent [241,243] studies have shown that the MIE is strongly influenced
by the hydrogen content and demonstrates a U-shape curve when
plotted as a function of hydrogen content, see Fig. 25. While the spark
duration was found to have no significant influence [241], the distance
between the electrodes has a large impact [241,243]. For a given
composition, Ono et al. [241] observed a variation on the order of a
factor of ten as the gap is varied from 0.5 to 4 mm. By attempting
ignition by both laboratory electrodes, and common electrical appli-
ances from everyday life, Swain et al. [243] showed that the spark
source is also a dominant factor for successful ignition or quenching
to occur. The effect of other parameters such as the humidity content
or the dilution level have also been tested. Ono et al. [241] found no
impact of relative humidity within the range 0%–90%. On the other
hand, Kumamoto et al. [244] showed that for an increase of the oxygen
fraction from 0.21 to 0.35 in H2-O2-N2 mixtures, the MIE was increased
by more than 2.8 times. Proust and Jamois [245] reported that the MIE
increases slightly for a temperature of 123 K as compared to ambient
temperature. This results was confirmed by Ghosh et al. [240]; they
studied very lean hydrogen–air mixtures, Φ=0.16, and found that the
MIE decreases approximately from 1 mJ at 205 K to 0.5 mJ at 295 K.
The effect of fluid motion and turbulence on spark ignition appears
to be complex. For a Reynolds number of up to approximately 10,000,
the results of Swain et al. [243] showed only a weak impact on the
sparking outcome. At a flow velocity around 2 m/s, Ghosh et al. [240]
did not observed a very significant impact on the MIE value as com-
pared to the one obtained for quiescent mixtures. As summarized by
Wu et al. [246], all the studies performed before theirs indicated that

ignition is more difficult in a turbulent environment, which results in a
higher MIE under such conditions. However, they further demonstrated
experimentally with various H2-O2-diluent mixtures that for mixtures
with Le>1, ignition in a near-isotropic turbulent environment can be
promoted because of the formation of negatively stretched flame seg-
ments whose burning intensity increases with stretch-rate. This result
was later confirmed by Shy et al. [247], who showed however, that
this turbulence-facilitated ignition phenomenon was restricted to small
electrode gaps.

2.6.2.3. Prediction of the minimum ignition energy.

2.6.2.3.1. Theoretical models The classical view on spark igni-
tion corresponds to the thermal model. It relies on the idea that ignition
success or failure is a result of the balance between chemical heat
release and thermal energy loss to the surrounding. The spark is viewed
as a point energy source whose energy is supplied as heat to the reactive
mixture. The heat diffusion leads to an exponential temperature profile
in a spherical volume of gas. Ignition would take place if the growth
rate of the hot kernel is large enough so that a minimum radius can
be reached before the temperature decreases to below the adiabatic
flame temperature [248]. Bane [214] proposed a modification to the
thermal model by considering a cylindrical kernel instead of a spherical

29

J.X. Wen et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

kernel. The model considers the flame kernel as a cylindrical volume of
gas and the electric spark as linear. The predictions agree reasonably
well with experimental results, especially when an accurate flame speed
measurement can be provided as input for the model [239].

Recent theoretical developments on forced ignition were performed
by Chen and Ju [249] and Yu and Chen [250]. Using a quasi-steady
assumption and high activation energy asymptotics, Chen and Ju in-
vestigated the effect of the input power on the ignition process within
the framework of the thermal-diffusive model. Both adiabatic and non-
adiabatic cases were considered. For sufficiently high energy input,
the ignition kernel branch intersects the branch of the propagating
flame. Such a condition can be considered to define a theoretical MIE.
For Lewis number lower/larger than unity, lower/larger critical input
powers were obtained. The effect of heat losses on the MIE is larger
for a Lewis number above unity. This work was extended by Yu and
Chen by retaining the contribution of unsteady terms while neglecting
radiative losses. They considered forced ignition with constant and
finite-duration central heating. In the case of the constant energy
source, unsteadiness tends to decrease the minimum velocity at which
the branches for ignition kernel and for flame propagation intercept.
Thus, a higher energy input would be needed to ensure successful
ignition. When considering a transient energy source, the MIE depends
on the power of the energy source and the duration of the energy
deposition. For a given power level, ignition quenching can take place
if the energy source is switched off after a too short period. They also
noticed the important impact of the memory effect in the determination
of the MIE whose value asymptotes for high enough power levels.

2.6.2.3.2. Numerical simulations

In many studies that relied on
numerical simulations to determine the MIE, a one-dimensional ap-
proach was employed. Although such an approach cannot reproduce
the detailed spark dynamics at early time [222], it can provide good
estimates of the MIE. Maas and Warnatz [251] and Kim et al. [252]
employed a similar approach to study MIE. The effect of equivalence ra-
tio, in particular the higher MIE for rich mixtures, could be captured by
Maas and Warnatz [251]. On the other hand, the two studies reported
an opposite evolution of the MIE with pressure, increasing for Maas and
Warnatz [251] but decreasing for Kim et al. [252]. The results of [252]
are in agreement with the experimental trend. Kusharin et al. [253,254]
investigated the effects of thermal radiation, and steam content on
the MIE. It was found that radiative losses can lead to an increase of
two orders of magnitude of the MIE, whereas a steam concentration
larger than 57% can prevent ignition at a temperature of 373 K and
atmospheric pressure. The most recent studies by Chen et al. [255]
and by Liang et al. [256] focused on the effect of preferential and
Soret diffusion, respectively. Chen et al. [255] reported that: (i) the
MIE varies linearly with the cube of the critical radius and that the
slope of this line decreases as the Zeldovich number increases; and (ii)
both the MIE and critical radius increase with the Lewis number. The
Soret diffusion of H2 was found to decrease/increase the MIE in the
close vicinity of the lean/rich flammability limits. Comparison with
experimental data demonstrated the primary importance of accounting
for Soret diffusion to ensure accurate prediction of the MIE.

Han et al. [257] employed two-dimensional numerical simulation
to investigate the effect of various parameters on the predicted MIE of
a hydrogen–air mixture. They considered detailed chemistry and took
into account heat losses to the electrodes to study the impact of the
energy supply procedure, the spark channel radius, the electrode size,
and gap distance. The MIE dramatically decreases if a 4-section instead
of a 1-section profile was employed to deliver the input energy. They
identified a critical spark channel radius of 0.35 mm above which the
MIE density is plateauing. While the MIE was found to be independent
of the electrode size for electrode gaps significantly larger than the
quenching distance, important discrepancies appeared as the electrode
gap was close to or shorter than the quenching distance. They also
studied in details the thermo-chemical processes during spark ignition.

2.6.3. Ignition of non-premixed mixture

Some studies have investigated the ignition by an electric spark of
partially premixed hydrogen–air mixtures formed as a jet of hydrogen
is released from a high-pressure source into the ambient atmosphere.

Imamura et al. [258] experimentally investigated the risk of hydro-
gen ignition at the exit of a ventilation duct by electrostatic discharge
created by the electrification of dust, rust, metal particle, or water
droplet, whose energy can be on the order of 10 to 100 times the
MIE measured in quiescent environment. They found that the use of a
tapered porous outlet is the most effective at preventing ignition by the
discharge formed by iron III oxide particles placed in the pipeline sys-
tem. They also showed that grounding the duct outlet enable to strongly
reduce the risk of electrostatic discharge formation and thus constitutes
a crucial element for ignition prevention. Merilo et al. [259] performed
a similar study and experimentally demonstrated the potential for even
a very small amount of particulates entrained in hydrogen releases to
generate electrostatic charge and induce electrostatic discharge igni-
tions in tests involving pressurized releases up to 14 MPa. This is shown
in Fig. 26.

Some studies have focused on the spark ignition of high-pressure
turbulent hydrogen jet into air [137,208,260–263]. Several of these
studies have attempted to establish the range of distances for which
electrical or laser spark ignition could be achieved, and to relate this
finding to the local hydrogen concentration. Ignition of the hydrogen
jet is possible only over a range of distances from the nozzle exit; if the
distance is too short/long, the hydrogen content is too high/low for
successful ignition to take place [263]. Takeno et al. [137] mentioned
that when the time-averaged hydrogen concentration was smaller than
10%, the flame was extinguished after a distance of 100–200 mm,
which was attributed to the characteristic spatial scale of eddies or
to inhomogeneous hydrogen distribution. Schefer et al. [260] reported
that local ignition could be achieved only if the composition at the laser
spark location was within the static flammability limits. This seems
consistent with the results of Swain et al. [262] who noted that the
maximum distances at which the jet can be ignited is shorter than the
distance at which a 4% concentration of H2 was measured. On the
other hand, Guo et al. [263] mentioned that the range of distance for
successful ignition measured experimentally was much larger than the
ignitable region determined from the estimated hydrogen concentration
along the axis of the jet. This seems in contradiction with the results
of [260,262]. Nevertheless, it is noted that Schefer et al. and Swain
et al. both measured the hydrogen concentration whereas Guo et al.
estimated it. The maximum distance for successful ignition proved to
be shorter for the highest flow velocity [262], whereas it increases with
the pressure in the tank [208]. Several authors [137,137] have pointed
out the statistical nature of the spark ignition process for ignition of
turbulent jet, and have pointed out the relevance of the concept of
flammability factor, which is obtained by integrating the local probabil-
ity density functions of the fuel concentration between the flammability
limits, and provides the true ignition probability [260]. Interestingly,
Wang et al. [208] did not find a significant effect of the spark energy
in the range 35 mJ to 3 J and concluded that the occurrence of the
spark rather than its energy is the relevant aspect for risk assessment
of hydrogen jet ignition.

2.7. Some miscellaneous topics on ignition

2.7.1. Ignition in expanding media

Mével et al. [87] conducted 0D numerical simulations with time-
dependent volumetric expansion induced by shock-speed decay. In
this quasi-unsteady approach, similar to [264], the shock speed was
assumed to follow a linear, exponential, or power-law decay, while
the temperature drop during the induction period was the same in
each case. For stoichiometric H2-air mixtures at p1 = 10–1013 kPa and
T1 = 300 K, two main conclusions could be drawn: (i) the expansion
induced by a shock-speed decay that follows a power law is the least

efficient at quenching ignition; and (ii) the complex response of the
ignition process to volumetric expansion can be attributed to the non-
monotonous evolution of the ignition delay-time with pressure and
temperature. Detailed thermo-chemical analyses demonstrated that, at
near-critical conditions, an increased competition is established be-
tween the chain-branching and the low-temperature chemical processes
for the production of OH. The competition between chemical heat re-
lease and volumetric expansion has been proposed as a dominant aspect
for successful ignition behind shock wave reflected off obstacles [130].
Coronel et al. [265] experimentally investigated the ignition of
stoichiometric hydrogen–oxygen(-nitrogen) by water hammer using a
special experimental facility composed of a gas gun and a U-shape pipe.
The U-shape pipe is filled with water and the reactive gaseous mixture
which are either in contact with each other or are separated by a solid
disk. The gas layer was subjected to a pressure pulse of triangular
shape. For experiments performed without the disk, they examined the
motion of the water–gas interface and determined ignition thresholds
using a combination of high-speed video, dynamic pressure and spec-
troscopic measurements. The Richtmyer–Meshkov and Rayleigh–Taylor
instabilities, induced by the impulsive acceleration of the water–gas
interface and deceleration created by the compression of the gas, were
found to result in large distortions of the initially planar and horizontal
water–gas interface. Peak pressures as high as 60 MPa were measured
under certain conditions. Although ignition did occur in some tests,
pressure increase was essentially suppressed by the dispersion and
mixing of water with the gas. Ignition leading to sustained combustion
with significant pressure increase was only achieved by eliminating the
instability of the water interface with the disk between the water and
gas.

Shepherd proposed a simple 0D unsteady model [266] to simulate
the experiment of Coronel et al. [265]. The reactor model was im-
plemented in Cantera and considers that the transient pressure pulse
during the water hammer ignition experiment could be approximated
by a Gaussian pressure pulse. Depending on the characteristics of the
pressure pulse, ignition or quenching was observed. These observa-
tions led Shepherd to propose the concept of critical pulse width to
characterize the critical ignition by a pressure pulse. This concept
is closely related to the concept of critical decay rate proposed by
Eckett et al. [264] to characterize ignition behind a decaying shock
wave. The concept of critical pulse width was further investigated by
Tan et al. [267] who performed detailed thermo-chemical analyses
including, heat release rate, rate of production, and sensitivity analysis.
They showed that at near-critical conditions, the competition between
H+O2=OH+O and H+O2(+M)=HO2(+M) was re-enforced. They also
proposed a non-dimensional modeling approach to describe ignition
induced by a pressure pulse.

2.7.2. Ignition following liquid hydrogen release

Van Wingerden et al. [268] released liquid hydrogen onto and
under water to explore the possibility of a rapid phase transition (RPT).
Although RPT was not observed, the liquid hydrogen quickly vaporized,
and a gas cloud formed above the release. The majority of the H2
released above the water, and all of the H2 released underwater ignited
in the gas-phase despite the absence of an obvious ignition source.
The authors suggested that a corona discharge from ice crystal motion
within the gas cloud above the release was the ignition source.

2.7.3. Ignition of real leaks

Iverson et al. [269] reported on combined experimental and nu-
merical investigations of ignited hydrogen leaks from a fitting attached
to a tube. They found it necessary to increase the supply pressure to
maintain the hydrogen flow due to leak path contraction upon heating
of the fittings. The results also suggested that, even if ignition takes
place, small, ignited hydrogen leaks from such compression fittings are
not likely to escalate.

2.7.4. Cavitation-induced ignition

Osipov et al. [270] discussed the possibility of cavitation-induced
self-ignition in cryogenic hydrogen–oxygen systems and mentioned five
possible mechanisms: (i) collapse of rarefied oxygen bubbles in liquid
oxygen, (ii) collapse of oxygen bubbles formed during impact of two
liquid oxygen blobs that have a chilled layer of liquid at their surface,
(iii) collapse of cold liquid droplets of hydrogen injected into hot liquid
oxygen, (iv) collapse of gaseous hydrogen–oxygen bubbles formed as
hot liquid droplets of oxygen penetrate into cold liquid hydrogen, and
(v) collapse of oxygen bubbles in the vicinity of the liquid oxygen
surface. They studied in more details scenario 5, considering that the
collapse of the oxygen bubble can be induced by a shock wave formed
at impact of a liquid oxygen droplet with a solid surface. The strong
pressure wave generated by the bubble collapse can then induced the
formation of a detonation in the gaseous hydrogen–oxygen mixture
surrounding the oxygen droplet.

2.8. Summary on ignition phenomena studies

Hydrogen–air mixtures are typically classified as easily ignitable, es-
sentially because of their low minimum ignition energy, which mainly
refers to ignition by electric spark. Nevertheless, ignition can be achie-
ved through a variety of processes, see overview in Fig. 27. The
classification of hydrogen–air mixtures as compared to other flammable
mixtures might be different depending on the ignition mechanism
considered in the risk assessment study. To summarize the studies
reviewed in this section, let us distinguish between unforced and forced
ignition phenomena.

Unforced ignition phenomena include shock ignition, spontaneous
ignition, and other specific ignition events. Reflected shock ignition

off the upstream face of obstacle plays a very important role in the
process of detonation onset in obstructed environment and for quasi-
detonation propagation. Idealized configurations considered in many
studies [100,106,108,111–115,119–123,127,128], with a wall block-
ing the complete channel area, demonstrate a number of principles.
In particular, the ignition process can be strongly influenced by the
boundary layer-reflected shock interaction which can induce a very
complex reflected shock wave bifurcation phenomenon and lead to
a remote ignition event rather than to a strong ignition. Recent 2D
and 3D dimensional numerical simulations [119–123,127,128] have
enabled a deep insight into the complex flow field formed during shock
wave bifurcation.

The spontaneous ignition of hydrogen has been extensively inves-
tigated experimentally [133,136–141] and numerically [114,142–151,
271]. Although some numerical studies predicted spontaneous ignition
during direct release into the atmosphere under certain pressures,
such a scenario has not been captured experimentally. Some numerical
simulations indicated that this might occur if the release was infinitely
fast, which is not possible in practice. Most literature has focused on
the spontaneous ignition during release through a section of a tube.
Generally, the propensity to spontaneous ignition increases with the
increase of the initial pressure and tube length, while it decreases with
hydrogen dilution by other gases. Early experimental investigations
were mainly qualitative in nature with limited global measurements.
Numerical studies, some with high-order numerical schemes and ultra-
fine grid resolutions, were conducted to capture the fast evolution and
complex shock laden flow structures leading to the autoignition. They
were largely conducted prior to the availability of those experiments
which produced images of the shock and flame structures. As such,
the reported numerical simulations have only been subjected to limited
qualitative comparison with experimental observations. Direct quanti-
tative comparison between the earlier numerical studies with the few
recent more detailed experiments is also not possible due to the dif-
ferences in initial pressure and tube geometry. Fresh numerical studies
with the same conditions as the newly available detailed measurements
are desirable. Regarding future efforts, some comments have also been
provided on the modeling approaches.

Forced ignition phenomena include hot surface and spark ignition.
Ignition by hot surface of various shapes (e.g., wire, sphere, cylinder),

has been extensively studied experimentally, theoretically, and numer-
ically [86,176,181–183,185–187,190–193,195,202–207]. The parame-
ters that control the ignition threshold are the size of the hot surface
(the threshold increases as the size decreases), the relative velocity
of the surface with respect to the gas (the threshold increases with
velocity), the equivalence ratio of the reactive mixture (the threshold
dependency on equivalence ratio depends on the reactive mixtures con-
sidered), and the reactivity of the surface (there is a higher threshold
for a reactive surface than for an inert surface). In many studies, the hot
surface ignition threshold was found to be around 1000 K and higher
for ambient pressure conditions [185]. Few exceptions are reported
with ignition temperatures around 900 K [205,208]. Comprehensive
numerical and experimental studies [86,181–183] have shown that
ignition by a hot surface is preferentially taking place at stagnation
and flow separation points due to minimized convective losses and
maximized heat diffusion from the hot surface at these locations. In
general, hot surface ignition is well understood and well characterized
experimentally. The ignition threshold can also be reasonably predicted
by numerical simulations. While many experimental and numerical
studies were performed under atmospheric or near-atmospheric pres-
sure conditions, data at high-pressure are lacking. One important aspect
related to hot surface ignition corresponds to the potential risk associ-
ated with catalytic hydrogen–oxygen recombiners. For high hydrogen
concentrations, the catalytic surface can become very hot and serves as
the ignition source. If the use of a catalytic recombiners is to be more
widely spread, their potential as ignition source will need to be better
characterized and considered in risk assessment studies.

Spark ignition has also been widely studied [213,214,216,217,224–
229,237,240,241,243,244,246,249,250]. Despite its high complexity,
the dynamics of the electric spark process is well understood and
has been studied in non-reactive [217,218,220–223] and in reactive
mixtures [213,216,217,224–229]. One basic feature of the electrical
spark process corresponds to the transition of the initial plasma kernel
(often quasi-cylindrical) into a region of high-temperature gas (often
toroidal). This transition is driven by the flow generated by the shock
resulting from the fast expansion of the plasma kernel. Ignition or
quenching can take place at the border of the reacting kernel depending
on a number of parameters including the spark energy, the geometry
of the electrode, the electrode spacing, the mixture composition, the

velocity of the fresh mixture, etc. For risk assessment, the relevant
parameter characterizing spark ignition corresponds to the MIE. This
quantity has been extensively measured [83,240–243,246,247] over
wide ranges of conditions. In general, relatively good consistency exists
between different studies [241]. Bane et al. [214,237] have further con-
firmed the statistical nature of the spark ignition process and employed
probability distribution to characterize the MIE. If the electric spark
is generated in a turbulent environment, the dynamics of the ignition
process can become even more complex and non-trivial effects, such
as the decrease of the MIE related to the increased burning intensity
of negatively stretched flame segments [246], can come into play. The
most recent theoretical developments in the framework of the thermal-
diffusive model [249,250] provided much insights into the effect of
various parameters on the process of ignition by a hot gas kernel.

Investigations have also been performed concerning ignition by wa-
ter hammer. One experimental study [265] demonstrated that ignition
could be achieved under certain conditions and also highlighted the in-
fluence of instability at the water–gas interface to hinder the transition
from ignition to stable combustion. Two numerical studies [266,267]
proposed a simple numerical model based on a Gaussian pressure pulse
to investigate critical ignition under water-hammer relevant conditions
and introduced the concept of critical pulse width. An interesting
0D modeling study [87] indicated the likelihood of non-monotonous
evolution of the ignition delay-time with pressure and temperature.
Finally, several scenarios for cavitation-induced ignition have been
proposed [270].

3. Jet flames

Molkov and Saffers [272] reviewed some earlier work on hydrogen
jet flames published from 1949 to 2013. Their review had a particular
focus on the correlations and identified that Froude number only based
correlations are deficient for under-expanded jet fires and proposed
their own flame length correlation accounting for the effects of Froude,
Reynolds, and Mach numbers. This paper takes a broader approach
incorporating experimental, analytical and numerical studies. In gen-
eral, hydrogen jet fires are high temperature flames, the characteristics
of which change with the release pressure, temperature and nozzle
size. These aspects have been the subject of considerable experimen-
tal, analytical and numerical investigations. On the other hand, the
behaviors of hydrogen jet fires are also influenced by the environment
conditions such as wind and proximity to grounds and other obstacles.
In comparison, relatively less investigations on these topics can be
found in the open literature, partly because of the related difficulties
to change such conditions systematically and safely.

3.1. Experimental investigations of hydrogen jet flames

Mogi et al. [274] experimentally investigated horizontal jet flames
from convergent nozzles with 0.1–4 mm diameter in the range of
overpressures 0.01–40 MPa. No stable flames were observed for nozzle
diameters of 0.1 and 0.2 mm as the flame blew off even if the spouting
pressure was increased up to 40 MPa. Their findings indicated that
under-expanded jet flames cannot be self-sustained at some conditions.
Schefer et al. [275] studied vertical hydrogen jet fires in the open for
both subsonic and sonic (choked) flows at pressures up to 17.2 MPa
and confirmed that the increase of the mass flow rate and diameter of
the jet nozzle induce an increase of the flame length. The same group
later extended their tests to a nozzle diameter of 5.08 mm with higher
pressures up to 41.3 MPa [273]. Under such conditions, departures
from ideal gas behavior became evident.

Fig. 28 shows typical single-frame video images of the visible flame
at various times, covering 11.3 m and 5.3 m in the vertical and
horizontal directions, respectively. The two horizontal glowing wires
were the ignition sources located at 1.9 and 2.6 m downstream of
the jet exit. Most successful ignition was triggered by the second

downstream wire where the flow velocity was sufficiently low and
the hydrogen/air mixture was within the flammability limits. The
images taken at slightly later times illustrate that the flame propagated
from the ignition location both upstream toward the jet exit where
it stabilized as a lifted flame (Fig. 28(b) and downstream into the
flammable mixture (Fig. 28(c) formed by hydrogen mixing with the
entrained air. This phenomenon is very important and was not only
observed for hydrogen jet flames under atmospheric conditions but also
for those under cryogenic conditions to be discussed in Section 3.4.
Fig. 28(d) was taken at 5 s when the flame had reached steady state.
Subsequently, the flame length slowly decreased over a period of about
500 s as the reservoir pressure decreased gradually. Except the flame
length which changed with time during the test, the flame appearance
remained constant during the test.

Horizontal hydrogen jet flames were experimentally investigated
by Imamura et al. [276] with internal diameter from 1 to 3 mm and
sprouting pressure up to 3 MPa; and at relatively large-scale by Studer
et al. [277] with internal diameters up to 15 mm and pressure up to
10 MPa. Some later tests reported by Proust et al. [278] for horizontal
jet flames covered the widest range of pressures from 1 to 90 MPa
and leak diameters of 1, 2, 3, and 10 mm. Fig. 29 shows the flame
length evolution with the orifice size and release pressure. The flame
length increased with the pressure but never exceeded 7 m. The rate

buoyancy. However, like all empirical/integral models, they are only
valid within the range of the experimental measurements used in their
derivation. Extrapolation of the models should be avoided unless extra
measurements become available to check their validity. As shown in
Fig. 30, Molkov and Saffers [272] suggested considering three jet flame
regimes: (i) buoyancy-controlled, (ii) ‘‘plateau’’, and (iii) ‘‘slope’’.

More recently, Yamamoto et al. [285] took schlieren images of
under-expanded non-premixed jet flame. Their results indicated that
the maximum waistline position, where the radial distance from the jet
axis to an elliptic stoichiometric contour reaches its maximum, comes
closer to the nozzle exit than the edge of the jet flame base, could be
used as a condition for flame blow off occurrence. Takeno et al. [286]
investigated the effect of shock structure on stabilization and blow-
off of hydrogen jet flames by using convergent, straight and divergent
nozzles with varying internal and external diameters. The graphical
abstract of their paper is shown in Fig. 31. The experiments revealed
that when the ratio of nozzle exit to ambient pressure was less than
2.45, the jet had sequential shock cell structures, a higher mass flow
rate of hydrogen was needed for the stabilization of a jet flame. They
further found that for highly under-expanded jets with ratio of nozzle
exit to ambient pressure greater than 4, characterized by a single Mach
disk, both the lift-off lengths and the minimum mass flow rate required
to obtain stable jet flame decreased with the ratio of the nozzle exit to
inlet cross-sectional areas. These findings were qualitatively supported
by their 2D numerical simulations.

In relation to the ignition of hydrogen leak in indoor environment,
Hooker et al. [287,288] carried out experimental and CFD investiga-
tions on the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behavior of
hydrogen jet fires using a 31 m3 enclosure, covering both subsonic and
chocked releases. The results indicated that sufficiently large ventila-
tion openings could prevent a jet fire from becoming under-ventilated
with the risk of incomplete combustion. The CFD studies of the authors
emphasized the importance of adequate boundary condition on the
enclosure walls to ensure reasonable predictions. Similar experiments
and numerical studies were also conducted by Xiao et al. [289] for
vented ignition and deflagration of a vertical sonic jet and indicated the
important influence of heat and mass transfer to the chamber walls and
it was essential for these to be adequately included in the CFD models
in order to simulate the confined hydrogen jet fire experiments.

3.2. Experimental investigations of jet fires of hydrogen blended with other
gases

Lowesmith and Hankinson [290,291] carried out large-scale high-
pressure jet fires involving natural gas and natural gas/hydrogen mix-
tures. Measurements were conducted for flame length and the incident

of increase was also found to slow down significantly above 30 MPa.
Some tests were also reported by Deimling et al. [279] and Kessler
et al. [280] for release pressures up 20 MPa through a nozzle diameter
of 10 mm. They observed transition of the outer jet layer into an
explosion converting to a nearly spherical volume at the jet head and
estimated the flame velocity from the nearly spherical explosion by an
averaged flame ball radius to be about 20 m/s. They also commented
on the frequency of self-initiation in the experiments. The combustion
process can be decomposed into (i) the shell combustion of the jet cone,
and (ii) a superimposed explosion of the decelerating jet head volume.
Some of the tests focused on the radiative characteristics of under-
expanded hydrogen jet fires [273,275,277,281]. Analytical models
have been developed on the basis of the experiments by Houf et al.
[282,283] and Ekoto et al. [284], who developed a new flame in-
tegral model to account for flame centerline trajectory distortion by
buoyancy effects. Prediction of the boundaries of the radiative heat
flux was achieved using a weighted multi-source model in which
the source emittance is tuned by radiant fraction. Comparison with
measurements indicated that model can be an effective tool to reduce
separation distances when flames are expected to be very sensitive to

radiation field produced around the fire were measured to provide
some global safety features of blended hydrogen and natural gas jet
fires.

Shmakov et al. [292] investigated the effect of adding inert (He,
N2, Ar, CO2) and reactive gas additives (CH4, O2, CF3Br, (CH3O)3PO)
to hydrogen and air on blow-off of flame at hydrogen release from
microleakage. The addition of the above gases to hydrogen was found
to narrow the microjet velocity range of stable combustion. The critical
velocity of flame blow-off was found to be mainly dependent on the
mean molecular weight of the combustible mixture with additives. It
was further found that when the gases were added to the air sur-
rounding the diffusion flame, the critical velocity of flame blow-off
was determined by their inhibiting effect on the chemical reactions of
hydrogen oxidation.

3.3. Numerical simulations of hydrogen jet flames

CFD based numerical studies typically bypass the shock-laden re-
gion of high-pressure releases and assume subsonic inlet boundary
conditions defined by the pseudo-diameter approach pioneered by
Birch et al. [293,294]. In this approach, isentropic expansion is typ-
ically assumed from stagnation conditions in the tank to the sonic
condition at the jet exit, through the notional nozzle expansion region
where the pressure reduces to atmospheric, as shown in Fig. 32.

Several authors have derived notional nozzle expressions for hydro-
gen through experimental measurements that rely on different assump-
tions such as conserved quantities (e.g., mass, momentum, entropy,
temperature) [273,295–297].

Ruggles and Ekoto [295] experimentally and analytically investi-
gated the ignition boundaries that result from compressed hydrogen
bulk storage leaks. Fig. 33 illustrates the mean schlieren images of
the under-expanded jet shock structures, including the barrel shock,
Mach disk, outer compression waves, and the diamond shaped reflected
shock structure downstream of the Mach disk. Their work indicated that
further notional nozzle refinement is needed to improve the prediction
fidelity. They further suggested using the Abel-Noble equation of state
to account for real gas effects when using these notional nozzle ex-
pressions. However, in the authors’ opinion, the necessity of using real
gas equation of state should be judged by the compressibility factor.
Hydrogen behaves as real gas under high pressure and low temperature.
Quantitatively, the decision should be based on the actual value of
the compressibility factor calculated at the initial release pressure
and temperature. This should be the case even if the notional nozzle
approach is used. For a comparison of these models, one can refer to
Ekoto et al. [284]. The comparative review of Molkov and Saffers [272]
suggested that ignoring losses could lead to overprediction of mass flow
rate and the flame length when considering narrow cracks.

Brennan et al. [298] conducted LES using commercial code ANSYS
FLUENT with the laminar flamelet models and assumed PDF shape
for combustion. Houf et al. [283] used in-house code with the RANS

approach and the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) for combustion.
Both groups of authors found that turbulence intensity has limited
effect on the flame length and achieved reasonably good agreement
between the predictions and measurements. The predicted flame length
was also in reasonably good agreement with the measurements of
Schefer et al. [273]. Wang et al. [299] conducted LES of the experi-
mentally tested conditions of hydrogen jet fires of [273,281] as well
as hydrogen/methane jet fires of Studer et al. [277]. They further
extended the modified EDC of Chen et al. [300] to address multi-
component fuels in the in-house version of FireFOAM code, which
is the LES based fire solver within the framework of open source
CFD code OpenFOAM [301]. The predictions achieved relatively good
quantitative agreement for flame length and radiant fraction with the
measurements of Schefer et al. [273], Studer et al. [277] and Ekoto
et al. [281]. The study of Wang et al. [299] also revealed that large-
scale hydrogen or hydrogen–methane jet fires cannot be regarded as
optically thin like their counterparts in small-scale laboratory tests. The
optical thickness of hydrogen jet fires tested by Schefer et al. [273],
Studer et al. [277] and Ekoto et al. [281] were estimated to be 0.8, 1.2
and 2.1, respectively. These fires behave like self-absorbing medium, in
which radiation absorption occurred within the fire.

Xiao et al. [302] used GASFLOW-MPI to simulate hydrogen jet fire
with heat transfer in a vented combustion chamber. Cirrone et al. [303]
numerically simulated 90 MPa hydrogen jet fires tested by Proust
et al. [278] using the commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT with real-
izable k-ε turbulence models and EDC for combustion, while the choice
of radiative properties is not clear. The results demonstrated good
agreement with the measured flame length, but less so for the radiative
properties dynamics during the first stage of the release (time<10 s).
Brennan et al. [304] numerically studied the overpressures arising from
jet fires from a 70 MPa onboard hydrogen storage tank through a
hole with a diameter of 3.34 mm, representing a thermally activated
pressure relief device (TPRD) in a small garage equipped with a unique
vent. The predicted overpressure for the ignited release is greater by
two orders of magnitude than for the unignited cases, reaching over
55 kPA in less than 1 s. Such overpressure could potentially cause
destruction of the structure. Numerical studies of the group have later
identified the pressure peaking phenomena, i.e., the existence of an
‘‘unexpected’’ pressure peak during the unignited release of a lighter
than air gas in a vented enclosure [305]. Unlike indoor release of
heavier than air gas, which is generally accompanied by a monotonic
increase of pressure until the steady state maximum pressure is reached,
there was a characteristic peak in the predicted pressure for a vented
enclosure, which exceeded the steady-state pressure. This was later
extended to ignited releases and validated against laboratory tests in
a vented enclosure of 1 m3 with three different gases: air, helium,
and hydrogen. The results contributed to the development of European

guidelines on indoor fuel cell and hydrogen systems. Recommendation
was also made for this phenomenon to be considered in relevant
Regulations, Codes and Standards.

Most hydrogen jet fire simulations conducted in the safety context,
as discussed above, used the notional nozzle approach to bypass the
near-nozzle shock laden region for computational efficiency. However,
the near field region needs to be incorporated in the simulations if
fine features in the under-expanded region is of interest. To achieve
this, it would be necessary to use pseudo ILES or DNS just like in
the situations of spontaneous ignition. Direct numerical simulations
of hydrogen–air turbulent jet lifted flames have been conducted by
Mizobuchi et al. [306,307]. The diameter of the hydrogen injector was
2 mm and a physical time of 0.5 ms was simulated. As illustrated in
Fig. 34(b), the lifted hydrogen flame was found to be composed of a
stable leading-edge flame, a vigorously turbulent inner rich premixed
flame, and several outer diffusion flame islands. These pockets of
diffusion flame burn in a rather flat shape in the outer boundary.
When these islands encounter the fluctuating inner rich premixed
flame, combustion is intensified due to increased hydrogen supply by
molecular diffusion. This process produces more diffusion flame islands
near the outer edge of the flame where there is an oxygen diffusion
layer. Increasing amount of the burned gas penetrates into the leading
edge of the flame, altering its structure, resulting in diffusion flame
islands near the leading-edge flame. Such transformation of the leading-
edge flame structure is thought to be an important mechanism for flame
stabilization. Further DNS by Mizobuchi et al. [308] using detailed
chemical reaction mechanism have shown tip opening in hydrogen
Bunsen flames. This was thought to be caused by lower hydrogen
concentration of the mixture coming into the cone due to its radial
outward diffusion, resulting in the breakdown of the reaction at the
downstream end of the cone. This series of DNS studies, although still
beyond the reach of the current computing power to be conducted
for high pressure hydrogen jets of realistic size, further highlight the
complexity of the underlying physics which may affect flame stability
as well as the possibility of incomplete combustion, leading to hydrogen
forming flammable cloud away from the original leak point or burner
in terms of indoor storage or use of hydrogen for heat. Such aspect is
also of safety concern.

3.4. Cryogenic hydrogen jet flames

Friedrich et al. [310] carried out release and combustion experi-
ments of cryogenic hydrogen jets with release temperatures between
34–65 K and pressures from 0.7 to 3.5 MPa. The different combustion
regimes observed include ignition with flash-back to the release nozzle
followed by a stable jet flame, a stable lifted flame without flash-
back as well as a transient burn with subsequent blow-off. Panda

and Hecht [311] experimentally studied the ignition characteristics of
a hydrogen jets for both atmospheric and cryogenic conditions with
initial temperatures of 37–295 K and pressures of 0.2–0.6 MPa. They
used a non-intrusive laser spark focused on the jet axis to measure
the maximum ignition distance. Their results revealed higher radiative
heat flux from jet flames of cold hydrogen in comparison with those
of atmospheric temperature for a given mass flow rate. The maxi-
mum ignition position and the flame length were also found to be
longer. Subsequently, Hecht and Chowdhury [312] studied the effect
of rectangular nozzle aspect ratio on low-temperature hydrogen jet
flame and found no obvious effect of the nozzle aspect ratio on the
hydrogen concentration distribution and the length/width of the flame.
Veser et al. [313] experimentally investigated the structure and flame
propagation of low-temperature hydrogen jets with initial temperature
of 35–80 K. They established some correlation between the flame
propagation direction and the local hydrogen concentration.

Cirrone et al. [314] numerically simulated the low-temperature hy-
drogen jet flame tested by Panda and Hecht [311] using the RANS ap-
proach assuming steady state. Their predictions captured the changing
trend of flame length and radiant heat flux, and correctly reproduced
the radiative heat flux from cryogenic hydrogen jet fire at different
locations. Ren and Wen [309,315] recently conducted DNS of unignited
cryogenic hydrogen jets and LES of the ignited jets. Thermodynamic
properties are calculated using the standard method for cryogenic
hydrogen, which relies on the explicit modeling of the Helmholtz free
energy [316]. The molecular transport model of Burali et al. [317],
which considers non-unity Lewis number effect, was used. The model
employed to calculate the thermal and transport properties is expected

to impact the hydrogen dispersion and, thus its spatial distribution. The

predictions, as shown in Fig. 35, illustrating that the ignition location,
zig, has considerable influence on the flame structure. For the near-
field ignition cases, with locations zig = 0.5 and 1.0 m, the nascent
flame grows from the ignition source and forms a diffusion flame on

the sides of the jet by propagating along its outer edge. Hydrogen–

air mixing is promoted by the shear at the high-velocity jet/quiescent

ambient air interface, which creates reactive pockets. The diffusion

flame propagation is also supported by the local backflow induced

by the rotating vortex generated in the shear turbulence. Therefore,

the expansion of the diffusion flame can be regarded as a turbulence-

controlled process. Ignition of the cold mixture inside the jet cannot

be achieved due to the low temperature in this region. The unreacted
mixture area is found to decrease as the zig is increased. For the far-field
ignition, with locations zig = 1.5 and 2.0 m, similar to the near-field
ignition case, the periphery of the jet is engulfed by a diffusion flame.

As the distance from the nozzle increases, the mixture temperature

within the main jet increases, whereas the fuel concentration gets closer

and closer to the stoichiometry. Such conditions favor the formation of

flame kernels. Inside the jet, premixed flame kernels form and grow

spontaneously to eventually form a premixed flame. Initially, because

of the low local flow velocity, the premixed flame propagates at a

velocity lower than the one of the diffusion flame. For these two cases,

deflagration waves were predicted.

3.5. Summary on jet flame studies

Most previous research on hydrogen gas jet flames were conducted
for open configurations while some limited studies examined hydro-
gen jet fires in enclosures. There is a significant body of knowledge,
including experimental data, numerical simulations and physics based
semi-empirical models available. However, it should be noted that
empirical/integral models are only valid within the range of the ex-
perimental measurements used in their derivation. Extrapolation of
the models should be supported by extra measurements to check their
validity.

Most of these studies addressed the safety related global features
like flame length, shape and radiative fractions rather than the fine
features of the flame structure and flame stabilization except the few
DNS studies, which revealed the co-existence of rich and lean premixed
flames as well as diffusion flame islands, which influence the flame
stabilization. Such features, especially flame stability, are also relevant
in the safety context, as jet fire blow-off, especially in confined or semi-
confined spaces could result in the formation of premixed hydrogen–air
cloud with potential explosion hazards.

There is relatively little published information about impinging
hydrogen jet fires addressing the effects of impingement on the com-
bustion characteristics and on flame impingement and the subsequent

effects on flame structure and thermal hazards. Such phenomenon
incurs additional physics such as the changed near and far field flow
structures, ignition and subsequent flame characteristics. Considerable
knowledge gaps exist on the topic.

With the current fast development of hydrogen transport through
long distance pipelines, there is concern about potentially very large
hydrogen jet fires which could result from pipeline-related accidents.
The radiative characteristics and hazards in such very large hydrogen
jet fires could increase significantly due to change in the spectral
radiative characteristics of very large hydrogen jet fires. However, no
experimental or CFD based numerical analysis have been conducted to
quantify the potential increase.

Some limited publications have emerged addressing jet flames in
cryogenic conditions, revealing the existence of different combustion
regimes including ignition with flash-back to the release nozzle, stable
jet flame, a stable lifted flame without flash-back as well as tran-
sient burning with subsequent blow-off. Detailed experimental mea-
surements are, however, lacking for liquid hydrogen jet fires to char-
acterize the resulting flashing jet fires and assist validation of CFD
models.

4. Deflagrations

One of the hazards from the delayed ignition of hydrogen is the
pressure generated during combustion, commonly termed explosion.
Overpressure can be generated from the combustion of a mixture
confined in an enclosure or in an unconfined space. Most hydrogen
explosions fall into the deflagration mode, in which the combustion
wave propagates at a velocity lower than the speed of sound (sub-sonic)
into the fresh, unburned mixture. In extreme cases, especially in the
presence of confinement and obstacles, the enhanced flame acceler-
ation can lead to deflagration to detonation transition (DDT), which
will be discussed in the next section. The present section addresses
deflagration. For completeness, it starts with an overview of laminar
and turbulent flame speeds. This is followed by the closely related
topic about self-acceleration of expanding flames. Subsequently, exper-
imental and numerical investigations of both semi-confined/confined
and unconfined hydrogen deflagrations are discussed. Because of some
very different features of vented hydrogen explosions and their special
importance to hydrogen energy application, which quite often involve
mobile storage facilities such as ISO containers, this topic is addressed
separately in the last sub-section.

4.1. Overview on laminar and turbulent flame speeds

Hydrogen burns in a non-luminous, almost invisible pale blue,
hot flame to water vapor. Impurities such as oceanic-air sodium or
other materials will give color to the hydrogen flame. Once ignited,
the laminar flame speed of hydrogen is high and has a propensity
to undergo deflagration to detonation transition. The relatively high
flame speeds, which are between 5 to 10 times that of pure methane
depending on the equivalence ratio, along with the wide flammabil-
ity range and low ignition energy, are the mains reasons why fires
and explosions represent a significant hazard for hydrogen. Molecular
diffusion plays an important role in the structure and propagation of
flames. The ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity is expressed
as the Lewis number (Le), which is in principle an evaluation of the
relative thermal and concentration boundary layer thicknesses [318].
In lean hydrogen combustion systems, the molecular mass diffusivity of
the mixture exceeds its thermal diffusivity, the mixture Le is less than
unity. The flame speeds in such cases are greater than the correspond-
ing unstretched laminar flame speeds. These effects are consequences
of the coupling between preferential diffusion and the reaction zone
structure. This is particularly important for hydrogen as the diffusivities
of hydrogen atoms and molecules are high. As reported by Dowdy
et al. [319], the Markstein length of H2-air flames change from about
−0.4mm at equivalence ratio of 0.3 up to 0.5 mm at equivalence ratio
of 2.3. Such characteristics renders lean hydrogen flames unstable. The
Lewis numbers, flame thickness, thermal expansion/heat content, and
activation energy, all play an important role when considering flame
dynamics asymptotically [320]. Once a flame has been ignited in a
hydrogen–air mixture, it may propagate with a high velocity [83],
owing to the large laminar flame speed of such mixtures. The laminar
flame speed is defined as the normal velocity of the fresh mixture with
respect to a fixed, planar flame front. Although hydrogen flames are
turbulent in most practical accidental scenarios, the turbulent burn-
ing velocity strongly depends on the turbulence parameters, turbulent
intensity and scales. It is well known that the propagation velocity
of a flame can differ from the laminar burning velocity by orders of
magnitude. Because the turbulence burning velocity is often expressed
as a function of laminar burning velocity and the turbulence parameters
with correlations from experiments, the treatment of laminar flame
speed is hence of paramount importance to the numerical modeling
of combustion in accidental hydrogen scenarios. The laminar flame
speed can be measured using a variety of experimental techniques.
Many studies [321,322] have revealed the difficulties in measuring
accurately this fundamental and important property when using the

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

popular spherically expanding flame technique. Recent experimental
and numerical studies [323–325] tend to show that large flame radius
data should be favored to reduce uncertainty when using this approach.
For hydrogen–air mixtures, a large number of studies have been per-
formed, see summary in [326], while measurements at near-cryogenic
conditions were recently performed by Proust and Jamois [245] and
by Ghosh et al. [327]. These studies showed that the laminar flame
speed decreases as the initial temperature is decreased. Because several
comprehensive reviews on laminar flame speed [328,329] have been
published in the last few years, we are not providing another extensive
review on this topic in the present document. In general, theoreti-
cal values agree well with the measurements, indicating fundamental
mechanisms of hydrogen combustion are adequately understood. As
an example, Fig. 36 shows the computed laminar flame speed of
hydrogen–air mixtures at atmospheric pressure for different normalized
equivalence ratios along with the measured values reported in several
studies. It should be noted, however, that important discrepancies
usually exist for very lean mixtures, since measurements in these condi-
tions is complicated by flame instability [321]. The laminar flame speed
is a function of pressure and temperature, which should be properly
accounted for in the modeling of premixed hydrogen flames [330].
Liu and MacFarlane [331] experimentally investigated the burning
velocities of H2-air mixtures as a function of the temperature and
composition of the unburned gases by laser doppler anemometry and
schlieren photography. A correlation was derived from the observed
burning velocities covering a hydrogen concentration range of 18 to
65% by volume, and a temperature range of 296–523 K. Verhelst and
Wallner [332] proposed a laminar velocity correlation for hydrogen/air
mixtures at spark ignition engine conditions, which is also used by some
modelers for hydrogen safety.

For laminar premixed flames, the molecular diffusion processes of
heat and species are known to be important while for highly turbulent
flames, turbulent mixing is expected to be dominant [334]. Several
experimental investigations have shown a dominant role of the Lewis
number even in highly turbulent premixed flames [335], especially
for increased pressure conditions [336]. These observations were con-
firmed in recent modeling of turbulent premixed combustion under
lean conditions, considering different fuels and pressures. This was
an unexpected results, since the Le characterizes molecular transport,
i.e., thermal and mass diffusivities, while highly turbulent flames are
believed to be primarily influenced by turbulent mixing rather than
molecular transport.

4.2. Self-accelerating spherical flames

Self-acceleration of expanding flames, which often occur in lean
mixtures [338], plays a crucial role in explosions. The increase in tur-
bulent flame speed as the turbulent intensity increases is significantly
larger for hydrogen–air than for hydrocarbon mixtures because to the
Le effects. In comparison with hydrocarbon–air flames under similar
conditions, turbulent combustion of lean hydrogen–air mixtures con-
sists of an abnormally large ratio of turbulent Strouhal number and lam-
inar flame speeds [339,340]. The phenomenon is commonly attributed
to the strong increase in the local burning rate due to significantly
increased local temperature and equivalence ratio in highly curved and
strained reaction zones induced by diffusive-thermal and preferential
diffusion [339]. Self-acceleration, owing to Darrieus–Landau (DL) and
diffusional-thermal instabilities, can lead to serious damage during
accidental hydrogen–air explosions. In order to aid understanding of
hydrogen explosions, a number of researchers performed explosion
tests in a closed chambers/vessels with optical access to observe flame
propagation using schlieren photography to capture the cellular flame
fronts evolution. Earlier experimental studies of Bradley et al. [341]
identified unstable wavelengths as a function of Markstein and Peclet
numbers. They found that spherical explosion flames firstly become
unstable at the first critical Peclet number (P ecr). Theoretically, the

effective reactivity of the fuel is highly dependent on the characteristic
flame size. The observed oscillatory rate of flame acceleration is consis-
tent with self-similar flame propagation. The authors also developed an
analytical model describing the growth of multiple generations of cells
on a spherical fame where the growth of each length scale was treated
independently [347]. Their results support a self-similar argument for
spherical flame acceleration and will be used in future studies to model
the behavior of large-scale flames.

Kim et al. [346] observed relatively large-scale flames in a 27.4 L
dual chamber compared to those in their previous experiments with a
0.79 L smaller chamber [348] as shown in Fig. 39. They also found, as
illustrated in Fig. 40, the critical Peclet number for the onset of flame
acceleration are comparable to previously found value in smaller scale
experiments of Jomaas et al. [349] and Kim et al. [348] as well as
the large-scale tests of Bauwens et al. [345], who observed significant
acceleration and increasing flame velocity by a factor of two for a
flame with radius of 0.5 m in their 64 m3 constant-pressure enclosure.
Katsumi et al. [344] further identified that the influence of flame
acceleration was stronger at lower equivalence ratio and proposed a
correlation which matches well their measurements.

Further insight of the thermo-diffusive instability development was
revealed by the two-dimensional numerical simulation of Berger et al.
[350] using detailed finite rate chemistry. They observed that local
cusps are the manifestation of the smallest length. This leads to the
appearance of cell on the flame front, whose size is approximately
that of the most unstable wavelength predicted by a linear stabil-
ity analysis. Their simulations also revealed a specific largest flame
intrinsic structure, which was referred to as flame finger, as shown
in Fig. 41, that emerges from the interaction of multiple small-scale
cusps. The numerical predictions revealed that thermodiffusively un-
stable flames periodically form and destroy these flame fingers, On the
other hand, the formation of a global cusp, characteristic of purely
hydrodynamically unstable flames, is suppressed.

4.3. Experimental investigations of hydrogen deflagrations

A series of large-scale tests have been conducted to help address-
ing safety issues in the fast evolving hydrogen energy applications
since 2005, especially for hydrogen vehicle refueling facilities. Takeno
et al. [351] reported large-scale experiments to investigate the hypo-
thetical scenario of dispersion and explosion of 40 MPa hydrogen gas
would leaks through pipe rupture as pressurized jets and disperses in
the air. Different ignition delay times were tested. Measurements were

angles), thermocouples (circles) and blast-wave transducers (triangles).

intrinsic flame instability of spherically expanding flame is relatively
well understood, see [342], which enables to estimate the critical flame
radius for onset of cellular flame with acceptable accuracy [324]. Al-
though the stretch effect stabilizes the flame at small radius, the flame
eventually becomes cellularly unstable, and therefore it accelerates
during flame expansion. As the flame radius increases substantially,
the flame reaches the self-similar regime [341,343]. It was generally
found that the flame propagation velocity increases as flame radius
increases [344–346].

Using the vented explosion facility shown in Fig. 37, which was
instrumented with background oriented schlieren technique, Bauwens
et al. [345] investigated spherical-flame acceleration in lean hydrogen–
air mixtures of different equivalence ratios. The experiments were
performed in a chamber of 64 m3 with a single 5.4 m2 vent to maintain
a constant internal pressure during flame propagation. The overall di-
mensions of the chamber is 4.6×3.0×4.6 m3 with a square vent located
on one of the vertical walls. Fig. 38 compares the development of fractal
structures on the flame surface over a range of equivalence ratios for a
number of flame radii. The results show very little variation between
the different equivalence ratios despite the increase of the overall flame
propagation velocity by a factor of 3.5 across the considered concentra-
tion range. The authors characterized the critical radius for the onset of
DL instability. The results evidenced that significant flame acceleration
was produced in lean hydrogen–air flames due to instabilities and the

front position with time revealed the maximum flame propagation
velocity to be about 978 m/s. Such flame propagation velocity of over
900 m/s in the open without the influence of obstacles was significant.
It was attributed to the initial turbulent mixing resulting from the high-
pressure jet, followed by strong turbulent premix combustion occurring
immediately after ignition.

Tanaka et al. [352] experimentally investigated hydrogen explo-
sions in a full-scale hydrogen filling station model as shown in Fig. 43(a).
The measured peak overpressure profiles in Fig. 43(b) can be seen to
decrease almost inversely with distance from the front face with its
value higher than has been reported for explosions of a comparably
sized, unconfined hydrogen cloud [353]. The maximum overpressure
was measured for the near-stoichiometric hydrogen concentration.

Large-scale hydrogen deflagration and detonation tests were con-
ducted by Groethe et al. [354] and Sato et al. [355]. Measurements
were conducted for flame-front time of arrival, blast pressure, heat

front), and imaging at locations from 5 to 50 m from the center. Rapid

rise of the pressure was observed due to deflagration as illustrated in

flux, high-speed video, standard video, and infrared video. A 300 m3
hemispherical facility was used for the open-space tests, see Fig. 44(a).
A thin plastic tent was employed to confine the mixture and was
cut before initiating a deflagration. The initial homogeneous hydrogen
concentration was varied from 15% (≈ 3.7 kg) to 30% (≈ 7.3 kg). To ex-
plore the effect of turbulence, an array of large cylinders, representative
of objects that could be found at a refueling station, was inserted within
the mixture for some experiments. For all tests, ignition was performed
at the bottom center of the facility. Blast and heat flux measurements
obtained at a distance of 15.61 m from the ignition point for a con-
figuration without obstacles (tests 4-03 and 7-03) and a configuration
with obstacles (test 4-04) are shown in Fig. 44(b). These obstacles were
found to provide no enhancement of the deflagration, which is in sharp
contrast to the results from smaller scale experiments having the same
volume blockage [356]. This feature could be related to the size of the
obstacles which is too large to induce a high level of turbulence. The
authors also performed several experiments in a 1/5-scale tunnel as
shown in Fig. 45(a). They released 0.1 and 2.2 kg of hydrogen into
the tunnel with and without ventilation to mimic a release from a
fuel cell vehicle or the storage cylinder on a hydrogen transport. For
some tunnel tests, obstacles representing vehicles providing an area
blockage ratio of 0.03, were used to investigate turbulent enhancement.
As shown in Fig. 44(b), the tests performed with an homogeneous
mixture containing 9.5% (0.32 kg) of hydrogen, the pressure increase
was too low to be detected by the sensors. For the mixture with 20%
(0.67 kg) of hydrogen, pressure pulses of approximately 35 kPa were
generated over the full length of the tunnel. The experiment performed

with 30% (1 kg) of hydrogen induced a pressure pulse of about 150 kPa,
which is significant higher than the pressure peak of 10 kPa recorded
during an equivalent unconfined experiment. On the other hand, in-
sertion of the vehicle models did not impact the deflagration, which is
attributed to the low blockage ratio of this configuration. Groethe et al.
also investigated possible enhancement related to partial confinement
produced by a narrow gap between plates, representing gaps between
equipment in a facility processing hydrogen or a refueling station.

Dorofeev [357] developed an empirical method to describe flame
acceleration in congested areas filled with combustible gases, consid-
ering flame folding arising from interactions with obstacles of the flow
produced by the flame and the turbulence-induced enhancement of the
burning rate in the flow ahead of the flame. The embedded coefficients
in the correlation were determined by fitting the model predictions
with available experimental data including that for hydrogen explo-
sions. The correlation can be used to evaluate the maximum flame
speed in vapor cloud explosions, considering the scale and density of
obstacles as parameters. However, caution should be exerted if the
application is outside the range of the data used to derive the fitting
coefficients.

A series of confined hydrogen tests were conducted by Marangon
et al. [358] in a 25 m3 cubic apparatus, Rai et al. [359] inside a 6
(L) × 0.9 (W) × 0.8 (H) m3 channel, Mogi et al. [360] in a small
cubic enclosure of 0.125 m3, Vaagsaether et al. [361] in a square
channel with 0.3 (L) × 0.045 (W) × 0.02 (H) m3 cross section with
a single cylindrical obstacle of blockage ratio 1/3 with 14 and 17 vol%
hydrogen in air. The resulting slow explosion only had a maximum

flow velocity of 13 m/s in the 14% H2 mixture and 23 m/s in the
17% H2 mixture. However, interesting measurements by PIV of the flow
velocity in the reactants ahead of the propagating flames we provided,
as shown in Fig. 46. Such data are useful for model validation.

Yáñez et al. [362] conducted an interesting analysis of the amount
of hydrogen taking part in the explosions that happened during the
Fukushima-Daiichi (Unit 1) nuclear power plant accident using both an-
alytic approximations and numerical calculations, which estimated that
130 kg of hydrogen was involved in the explosion. Their analysis also
suggested that even if a significantly smaller amount of hydrogen would
be involved, a devastating explosion would have occurred regardless.
Shirvill et al. [363] conducted premixed hydrogen–air experiments
at the experiments site of the Health and Safety Laboratory to examine
the effects of congestion and confining walls on turbulent deflagra-
tions in a hydrogen storage facility. The pressure sensor and ignition
positions are illustrated in Fig. 47. The congestion was induced by
hydrogen cylinders. The measured flame arrival time, as shown in
Fig. 48, indicated that the one- and two-wall experiments were not
significantly different qualitatively. However, the flame speed derived
from flame arrival times were slightly higher in the two-wall high-wall
ignition case when compared to the one-wall ignition case. This slightly
increased flame speed manifests in the form of overpressure as can
be seen in Fig. 48. These results suggest that the extra confinement
provided by two walls leads to higher overpressures and imply that the
use of blast wall to mitigate explosion overpressure needs to consider
the congestion incurred by the wall when sitting the wall and defining
its height. The authors later tests examined the effects of the increase in
hydrogen concentration in hydrogen–methane–air mixture [364,365].

4.4. Numerical simulations of hydrogen explosions

Molkov et al. [366] conducted CFD simulations to reveal the devel-
opment of a cellular structure and its fractal dimension in a large-scale
hydrogen–air confined deflagration. CFD simulations have also been

conducted by Makarov and Molkov [367] for stoichiometric hydrogen–
air deflagration in a closed 2.3-m diameter spherical vessel. García
et al. [368] reported a benchmark exercise for CFD predictions of stoi-
chiometric hydrogen–air mixture in a 10-m radius balloon numerically
tested by Schneider and Pfortner [369] and Becker and Ebert [370].
Seven organizations participated to the exercise using different CFD
codes as part of the HySAFE European Network of Excellence. Simi-
lar exercises were also reported by Baraldi et al. [371], also within
HySAFE, to simulate hydrogen explosions in a 78.5-m long tunnel
tested by Groethe et al. [354] and Sato et al. [355], and Makarov
et al. [372] for a lean uniform hydrogen–air mixture and a stratified
mixture with hydrogen concentration gradient experimentally tested
by Whitehouse et al. [373], which were performed in stratified and
uniform hydrogen–air mixtures. In both cases, the mixtures were qui-
escent and dry. The experiments were conducted in a closed vessel
which is 1.5 m in diameter and 5.7 m high and has an internal
volume of 10.7 m3. Fig. 49 compares the measured and predicted
pressure and flame dynamics for the uniform and gradient mixtures
with about the same average volumetric concentration. The gradient
mixture deflagration was an order of magnitude faster than that for
the uniform mixture while the measured peak overpressure was about
30% lower and showed more fluctuations with time. The later feature
could be attributed to the fluctuation of the concentration of hydrogen
at the pressure sensor’s location.

Wen et al. [374] conducted CFD simulations of hydrogen explosions
in a refueling environment and in a model storage room in a vehicle
refueling environment experimentally tested by Shirvill et al. [375].
Vendra et al. [376] conducted large eddy simulation using their in-
house modified OpenFOAM for hydrogen cloud explosion tests. They
considered the configuration experimentally investigated by Shirvill
et al. [363], which corresponds to an environment congested by hy-
drogen cylinders. Combustion was modeled with the flame surface
wrinkling model in which the transport of the progress variable is
governed by a laminar burning velocity and a flame surface wrinkling
factor [377]. The unstrained laminar burning velocity correlation of

Dahoe [378], covering different equivalence ratios, was used. The
predictions captured the measured flame arrival time and overpressure
with reasonable accuracy. The results were analyzed to shade light on
the impacts of congestion, confinement, and the location of ignition on
explosion overpressure. Bauwens and Dorofeev [379] analyzed the con-
sequences of an accidental hydrogen release in a ventilated ware-house
(>15,000 m3). They used FireFOAM to simulate the dispersion and
mixing of hydrogen, and developed a physics-based simplified model
to estimate the pressure loads induced in the facility by deflagration in
hydrogen–air mixtures.

The above CFD simulations have used a combination of relatively
simple turbulent combustion models which are readily available in AN-
SYS FLUENT and OpenFOAM. While these relatively simple combustion
models with some ad-hoc refinement to incorporate the variation of
laminar flame speed with mixture composition and non-unity Lewis
number effects, etc., were found to be sufficient to capture some global
features of turbulent deflagration in hydrogen explosions. Their ability
to resolve fine flame features is limited due to the lack of essential
physics to address the underlying fine chemical and physical processes.
Another series of efforts were conducted with the turbulent flame
closure (TFC) model and its variants. The TFC was firstly introduced by
Zimont [380] to address the different treatment of the effects of small-
scale and large-scale turbulent eddies on the burning velocity; and
subsequently improved [381]. Given that the mean flame thickness de-
pends on the characteristic time of flame-development and that the Kol-
mogorov time scale is much larger that the time scale of the interaction
between flamelets and small-scale turbulent eddies, the characteristic of
the ‘‘thickened flames regime’’ was suggested and is sometimes referred

to as ‘‘Intermediate Steady Propagation (ISP)’’ regime [380,381]. Based
on this concept, Lipatnikov and Chomiak [382] proposed the Flame-
Speed Closure (FSC) combustion model, which was referred to as the
Extended TFC model (ETFC). The ETFC will revert to the TFC model in
fully turbulent conditions.

Sathiah et al. [330] used the RANS approach to predict the vari-
ous regimes of hydrogen deflagration and its consequence in nuclear
power plants (NPP) using the setup of various NPP containment-like
experiments. The density-averaged Navier–Stokes equation with k-ε
turbulence model were solved using commercial CFD code ANSYS
FLUENT using the TFC model of Zimont et al. [381], and Lipat-
nikov and Chomiak [382] implemented through UDF for combustion.
Validation was firstly conducted with small-scale hydrogen–air fast
deflagration experiments from [383,384] using the ENACCEF facility.
The modeling approach was further validated against the deflagration
of both homogeneous CO2-He diluted hydrogen–air mixture [385]
and non-homogeneous hydrogen–air experiments [386] in the same
ENACCEF facility using different numbers of annular baffles to control
the blockage ratios. Fig. 50 shows the variation of the axial flame front
position with time calculated using three different levels of adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR). The predictions have captured the four dif-
ferent phases of flame propagation identified in the experiments: (a)
quasi-laminar flame propagation, (b) turbulent flame acceleration, (c)
turbulent flame deceleration, and (d) turbulent jet flame. The model
over predicted the flame velocity, defined as the ratio of axial flame
positions with time, measured experimentally. The authors identified
three possible causes: (a) the very low initial turbulence levels in the
experiments was over estimated, (b) overprediction of the turbulence

44

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

levels by the standard k-ε model, and (c) overprediction of the tur-
bulence source term by the applied TFC combustion model. As seen
in Fig. 50, a time shift between the experiments and the simulations
is introduced by the overprediction of the flame velocity. Additional
validation was also conducted with the medium-scale slow deflagration
experiments with homogeneous hydrogen–air [387] in a 9.2 m tall
cylindrical vessel with an internal diameter of 3.2 m and a total
volume of 60 m3. The results showed that the TFC model performs
better for fast deflagration experiments [385,388], whereas against the
relatively slow deflagration experiments, the ETFC model was shown to
be superior in the predictions [388]. Tadej et al. [389] reported qual-
itative and quantitative evaluation of the TFC and ETFC combustion
models against the large-scale upward flame propagation experiment
of hydrogen slow deflagration [390,391]. However, the simulations
with both TFC and ETFC substantially overpredicted the radial flame
propagation, the overpressure increase rate, and the overall combustion
energy output. The ETFC was found to be slightly superior. The likely
reason was thought to be linked with its inclusion of quasi-laminar
source term, which lent it more suitable for the chosen large-scale
validation experiment which did not have any turbulence-inducing
structure, and the combustion took place in low-turbulence regimes.

A number of CFD simulations have also been conducted to address
safety in hydrogen energy applications [302,392] with relatively few
details about the methodology used. On the other hand, detailed LES
simulations have been conducted by Volpiani et al. [393] using a dy-
namic flame wrinkling factor model in a relatively small semi-confined
environment with a square cross section combustion chamber (5 cm ×
5 cm × 5 cm) with repeated obstacles.

On another front, Puttock et al. [394] reported the development
and validation of PDRFOAM within the framework of OpenFOAM
for predicting gas explosions in congested plant. It uses the poros-
ity/distributed resistance (PDR) approach to account for the effect of
small-scale obstacles, such as pipes and vessels, on flame propagation
and explosion overpressure. The model uses porosity modified standard
k − ε turbulence model and the transport equations for the flame
wrinkling parameter are solved. While the model has yet to be tested
for hydrogen explosions, it represents an interesting perspective when
high confinement and complex geometry need to be addressed. How-
ever, further development of the sub-models to address the underlying
physics and further validation are necessary before the model can be
widely used for hydrogen explosion studies.

4.5. Vented deflagrations

Venting is the most frequently used measure for mitigating explo-
sions in industry. It is, however, not straightforward to design vent
systems that will open at the right combustion induced overpressure
to protect facilities and surroundings. The need to gain insight of the
underlying physics and develop relatively simple models to assist the
design of venting systems has motivated considerable experimental,
analytical, and numerical investigations.

In vented deflagrations, the flame evolution is influenced by mul-
tiple factors like enclosure geometry and size, the location, size and
deployment pressure of the vent, ignition location, and obstacle con-
figuration. The series of processes from ignition, flame propagation
and venting are accompanied by various instabilities [395,396]. The
hydrodynamic DL and thermo-diffusive instabilities are predominant
at the early stages of the flame propagation, leading to cellular and
wrinkled flame front. During venting, Helmholtz oscillations are gen-
erated within the enclosure by the expelled gases. The vented flame
and hot combustion products accelerate into the relatively cold ambient
environment, giving rise to Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities at the
in nature and couple with
flame interface. These instabilities coexist

flow turbulence to accelerate the turbulent deflagration. Their existence
renders the complex flame acceleration and distortion effects, which
govern the rate of overpressure development, to be too complicated
to be amenable to simple scaling laws. Tests at comparable scales to
that of the relevant practical applications are hence of great importance
to address the related safety issues. The present subsection is hence
focused on the discussion of experimental, analytical and CFD studies
of relatively large-scale vented hydrogen explosions.

4.5.1. Experimental investigations of vented deflagrations

Experimental investigations of vented deflagrations have involved
different gases, configurations and dimensions. Most of the earlier tests
were largely conducted with hydrocarbon fuels or dust explosions with
only limited few being conducted with hydrogen. The surge of interests
for hydrogen energy applications have led to the increase in the number
of vented hydrogen explosions tests. Table 5 provides a summary of the
major experimental investigations for vented hydrogen deflagrations.

Vented deflagration tests for hydrogen have been conducted with
enclosures of various shapes, sizes, and hydrogen concentrations by
volume from 8 to 30% [397,399–401,413]. Using the facility shown in
Fig. 37, Chao et al. [396] and Bauwens et al. [379,403–405] conducted
a series of tests for homogeneous hydrogen–air mixture from 12 to
20% with different ignition locations, with and without obstacles. Two
pressure peaks were observed as shown in Fig. 51. The first peak, often
referred to as Pext, was generated by a combination of the external
explosion, Helmholtz oscillations and the Taylor instability. The second
peak, Pvib, was observed in some of the tests as the flame approached
the walls due to interactions between the flame surface, acoustic waves
and the walls [337].

Kumar [399,400] considered the effects of initial turbulence and
found that much higher overpressures than those in quiescent mixtures
were observed even at low hydrogen concentrations. Hence, it was
suggested that turbulent flames are not prone to instabilities in the
same manner as laminar flames, in which the instabilities promote tran-
sition to turbulence. In case significant turbulence already exists, the
flame front instabilities responsible of oscillatory combustion does not
develop, implying that combustion is a scale-dependent phenomenon.
Kumar [399] found that some of the phenomena observed in the
large-scale vented combustion facility were not observed in the 2.3-m-
diameter vessel. Daubech et al. [401] tested two cylindrical chambers
of 1 m3 (length 1.4 m and internal diameter 0.94 m) and 10.5 m3
(length 5.5 m and internal diameter 1.6 m) with hydrogen mixtures
between 10 and 27%. The vents were 0.13 m2 and 2 m2, respectively
in each chamber. In all the tests, the ignition point was at the bottom
of the cylinder. Only one pressure peak Pext was observed. However,
as noted by Jallais and Kudriakov [413], very limited information
was available about the dynamics of the peak overpressure and on
data filtering in the above three tests [399–401] and the earlier tests
of Pasman [397]. In some other tests [414,415], a third peak in the
overpressure, Pobs, was also observed due to increase in flame surface
area when obstacles were present in the enclosure.

Some of the more recent tests have considered heterogeneous
hydrogen–air mixtures [288,406–409] in empty enclosures as well as
enclosures with varying degrees of realistic congestion. Skjold et al.
[407,408] conducted 66 tests in 20-foot (38.55 m3) shipping containers
to investigate the effects of hydrogen concentration, vent area, type
of venting device, ignition position as well as the level and type of
congestion inside the container. The results confirmed that adding in-
ternal congestion to the container significantly increased the maximum
explosion pressure. Fig. 52 illustrates the setup in the tests of Skjold
et al. [407,408]. Fig. 52(a) shows the bottle basket with twenty 50-L
high-pressure gas cylinders and a pipe rack with four layers of 1.2-
m-long pipes which could be fixed to the frame inside the container.
Fig. 52(b) illustrates the interior of a 20-foot ISO container with vent
panels in the ceiling and the pipe rack in middle position. Fig. 53
provides some snapshots, which were extracted from video footage in
3 of the 66 tests conducted. The top frames were from Test 09 with
bottle rack and venting through container door, which was initially
closed. One door rebounded off the gravel located on the container’s
side and was projected 30 m away. The internal overpressure reached
approximately 1.1 to 1.3 bar, which resulted in the rupture of the
container. The middle frames were from Test 14 with both pipe and
bottle racks in the container and the container door was open. Such
a highly congested environment promoted flame acceleration within
the pipe rack. In addition, vent opening was blocked by the bottle
basket. These two aspects led to high over-pressures. The bottom
frames were from Test 18 with pipe rack and commercial vent panels
on the roof. The results indicated the relatively higher effectiveness
of roof venting as compared to venting through the side with open
doors. In Fig. 54, the measured maximum overpressures for stratified
and homogeneous mixtures with commercial vent panels of 6 m2 on
the roof are illustrated. The authors also computed the overpressure
with the then available version of EN-14994 [416]. The non-uniform
mixtures resulted in stronger explosions compared to homogeneous

Schiavetti and Cacassi [409] also compared the effects of congestion
for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous mixtures with strati-
fied hydrogen concentration. Their results indicated that experiments
performed in idealized conditions with homogeneous mixtures in the
absence of obstacles would underestimate the maximum peak pressure
in practical situations where hydrogen is often stratified, and obstacles
are almost always present inside the enclosure.

Liang et al. [410] experimentally investigated the flame dynamics
of vented deflagration in stratified hydrogen–air layers. Although the
volume-averaged concentration of hydrogen is below the flammability
limit, significant overpressures were measured within the regions of
high local concentration. This is in line with the prediction of the
analytical model of Makarov et al. [417], which indicates that the
maximum overpressure of a vented localized deflagration in a non-
uniform mixture is controlled by the highest burning velocity reached
in only a small fraction of the mixture. Hao et al. [411] and Li
et al. [412] tested vented hydrogen explosion in a 40-foot container
with and without obstacles. They found that back ignition led to larger
peak displacement and acceleration than central ignition.

4.5.2. Numerical modeling of vented deflagrations

Baraldi et al. [418] reported validation exercise by different author
groups in the HySAFE project using the small-scale tests of Pasman
et al. [397] for stoichiometric hydrogen deflagrations in a 0.95 m3 ves-
sel with vents of different sizes (0.2 and 0.3 m2). Related CFD modeling
has also been reported by Molkov et al. [419] for vented methane–air
explosion in an empty 547 m3 enclosure using the LES approach. The
predictions evidenced the complexity of the simultaneous interactions
between flow, turbulence and combustion during flame propagation
inside the enclosure and after venting in the atmosphere. These studies
highlighted the challenges to model the vented deflagrations, for which
various flame instability effects combine with the effects due to flow
turbulence to influence flame acceleration and propagation in vented
deflagrations. These instabilities coexist in nature, but for the sake of
implementation convenience are mostly modeled in numerical simula-
tions as mutually exclusive events using either an algebraic expression
or solving a transport equation [337]. Bauwens et al. [337] developed
a 3D gas dynamic model for the simulation of gaseous combustion
in vented enclosures within the framework of OpenFOAM using the
combustion model of Weller et al. [301], in which the scalar flame
surface wrinkling factor was transported to capture the effect of flame
wrinkling on the burning velocity. In order to consider the significant
increase in the flame surface area and propagation speed due to flame
instabilities in a lean hydrogen–air mixture, the authors modified the
flame wrinkling factor to incorporate the flame instabilities as,

Ξ = Ξt ⋅ ΞDL ⋅ ΞRT

(2)

where ΞDL is the surface wrinkling factor due to the DL flame instabil-
ity, Ξt is the surface wrinkling factor due to turbulence, and ΞRT is the
surface wrinkling factor due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability.

The predictions of Bauwens et al. [337] captured the trends of the
initial pressure build-up for all the ignition locations and vent sizes in
their own tests. The predicted maximum overpressures for back igni-
tion tests were in reasonably good agreement with the measurements.
However, significant discrepancies existed between the measured and
predicted overpressure peaks for front and central front ignition. The
authors postulated that the latter was likely linked with the structural
response of the chamber which was not considered in the model.
Keenan et al. [420] modeled the same tests using ANSYS FLUENT
with modifications through UDFs to address the RT instability by
substituting the laminar burning velocity term with the sub-grid scale
(SGS) wrinkled burning velocity to consider the unresolved physics
affecting burning rate at all SGS lengths. Their predictions also con-
firmed the significant role of the instabilities throughout the coherent
deflagration process and trends of overpressure evolutions. However,
as shown in Fig. 55, the model modified with RT still did not result

14994 computes the overpressure from the mean concentrations and
hence it is unable to account for any inhomogeneity.

in obvious improvement in the agreement between the predictions and
measurements.

Vendra and Wen [421] modified the in-house version of OpenFOAM
to simulate the large-scale tests of Skjold et al. [407]. They used the
unstrained laminar flame speed correlation for lean hydrogen–air mix-
ture of Verhelst [422], which is valid for lean mixture with equivalence
ratio between 0.3 to 0.5. For mixtures having equivalence ratio higher
than 0.5, the Ravi and Peterson [423] correlation was used. The Lewis
number effects were considered using the reaction rate closure model
of Muppala et al. [424]. To account for the dominant effects of the
Darrieus–Landau and thermo-diffusive instabilities in lean hydrogen–
air mixtures, the analytical expression of Bauwens et al. [337] for
the modified flame surface wrinkling factor was adopted. The pre-
dictions well captured the magnitude of the first overpressure peak
with discernable time lags in occurrences of pressure peaks in the later
parts of the pressure trace due to the unaccounted structural response.
Subsequently, Vendra and Wen [425] further improved the model to
address fluid structure interaction (FSI) in a pseudo two-way approach.
The predictions of the improved model well captured the measured
trends of the overpressures and overcame the unphysical negative peak
pressures in their earlier predictions without FSI. Fig. 56 illustrates
the predicted interactions of the flame front with the obstacle in the
enclosure.

CFD modeling of vented hydrogen deflagrations have also been
reported by others [41,426]. Skjold et al. [408] reported the results of
a blind-prediction benchmark exercise involving different CFD models
simulating some planned vented hydrogen deflagration tests. Fig. 57
summarizes the results, showing significant spread in the predictions
of the maximum overpressure by different models or the same models
by different users.

4.5.3. The standards for vent panel design for explosion protection

The above experimental studies were largely motivated by the need
to develop physics-based empirical models (EMs) which could be used
for design of vent panels in hydrogen energy applications, which can be
included in the vent panel design standards. As already mentioned, the
EN-14994 model is the vent panel design standard in Europe [416]. The
latest version available was published in 2007. NFPA-68 is the Ameri-
can standard; the latest version available was published in 2018 [427].
Both standards cover all flammable gases and considered hydrogen
through some ad-hoc treatment. None of them specifically addressed
the underlying physics in vented hydrogen explosions or were validated
with realistic hydrogen explosion tests.

Bauwens et al. [403,404] developed an EM by considering three
different factors responsible for pressure rise inside an enclosure: (i)
external explosion, (ii) flame-acoustic interaction, and (iii) flame wrin-
kling caused by obstacles. These factors are responsible for multiple
peaks observed in pressure transient measurements. They proposed
physics-based formula to calculate the overpressures for these processes
separately and take the maximum of these three peaks as the resultant
overall peak overpressure. The model relies on the theoretical approach
of Bradley and Mitcheson [428] and Tamanini [429], which describe
the flame propagation inside enclosure, pressure rise related to the
burnt products expansion and venting-induced pressure loss. The fi-
nal overpressure depends on the interplay of these processes. Various
physical processes and fuel properties were considered to arrive at an
expression for calculating the overpressure peak due to external cloud:

aspect ratio. The factors kT and a were used to account for increase
in flame-front area due to Rayleigh–Taylor instability and need to be
determined. Molkov et al. [395] and Molkov [430] proposed a series
of models using the concept of turbulent Bradley number:

ease. As illustrated in Fig. 59, the model predictions for realistic
vented hydrogen deflagrations with initial turbulence, obstacles and
stratification in hydrogen–air concentrations compare favorably with
large scale experimental measurements.

The model has now been accepted in the new release of EN-

where Br is the Bradley number [428], σ is the expansion ratio, γ is the
specific heat ratio for unburnt gases, χ∕μ is the deflagration-outflow
interaction (DOI) number, in which χ is the turbulence factor and μ is
the discharge coefficient. The basic assumption of this model is that
the turbulent Bradley number correlates with overpressure. Various
experimental studies are used to get curve-fit for this correlation and
two equations were proposed, with the first giving the best-fit values
with the experimental data and the second a conservative estimate. The
correlation was subsequently improved over the years [431].

An independent evaluation was conducted by Jallais and Kudri-
akov [413] for the different versions of the above models. Their results
suggested the suitability of Bauwens et al.’s model [404] for lean
mixtures with hydrogen concentrations below 20% and for enclosure
with small aspect ratios; and of the model of Molkov et al. [395] for hy-
drogen concentration of 20%–30%. The evaluation also highlighted the
need for a model to consider non-homogeneous hydrogen–air mixtures.
A more recent evaluation was also conducted by Sinha et al. [432]
using a comprehensive range of historic and more recent experimental
measurements specifically for hydrogen, including initial turbulence
and obstacles. The EN-14994 model was found to over-predict the
pressure peak for lower hydrogen concentrations and under-predict
that for higher concentrations. The NFPA-68 model was found to over-
predict most of the considered experiments. Their results support the
recommendations of Jallais and Kudriakov [413] concerning the model
of Bauwens et al. [404] and Molkov et al. [395], but also identified
some limitations of both, especially the relatively large scatter in their
predictions, as illustrated in Fig. 58, for realistic obstacle configurations
studied in Skjold et al. [407].

Sinha et al. [434] proposed another EM based on external cloud ex-
plosion by considering the four processes in vented explosions, i.e., ig-
nition and spherical flame propagation, venting of unburnt mixture and
formation of the external cloud, combustion of the external cloud pro-
ducing external pressure and internal flame generating overpressure.
They considered each process with published correlations/detailed
measurement in the literature, e.g., the flame propagation speed was
estimated using the correlations which Bauwens et al. fitted from their
experimental measurements for lean hydrogen–air mixtures [345]. The
model was further simplified by Sinha and Wen [435] to consist of
just one equation as shown below for the internal pressure. It has
two pre-tabulated parameters (F 1 and F 2) for the fuel properties and
two geometric parameters (G1 and G2), which are simple functions of
enclosure and obstacle geometry, and can be computed with reasonable

4.6. Summary on deflagration studies

Considerable efforts have been devoted to experimental, analytical
and numerical investigations of hydrogen explosions as well as venting
as an effective mitigation measure to reduce over pressure conse-
quences of explosions. Both intermediate- and large-scale experimental
work have been reported along with CFD validations based on the
reported measurements. Most of these studies focused on the safety rel-
evant global behavior, especially the development of the overpressure
trends.

The CFD models used have included commercial codes FLACS,
GASFLOW-MPI, and ANSYS Fluent, the latter with some ad-hoc im-
provements through UDFs, as well as open source CFD code Open-
FOAM. The most often used combustion models have included the
flame wrinkling model [301], EDC, as well as more elaborated models
like TFC and ETFC. Quite often in the CFD simulations of large-scale
explosions, it is not possible to define grid resolutions strictly to the
need of resolving the underlying physics. Unless the grid resolutions
would allow the fine details of the underlying physics to be appropri-
ately captured, the potential improvement of predictions by refining
the sub-models will be limited. The resulting improvement which may
be achieved in one scenario may not necessarily be carried over to

a different scenario and geometrical arrangement. Most simulations
were conducted with the objective to establish the correct trends of
the overpressure development and predict the peak overpressure with
reasonable accuracy to aid consequence analysis, facility siting, etc.
For this purpose, the reported modeling approaches are considered
appropriate.

While the earlier hydrogen deflagration tests were mainly con-
ducted with homogeneous hydrogen–air mixtures, the recent surge
for the need to address safety issues in hydrogen energy applications
has led to a series of small-, medium-, and large-scale tests involv-
ing both homogeneous and non-homogeneous mixtures with stratified
hydrogen–air concentrations. As most of the experimental and numer-
ical studies concerning mixtures with concentration gradients were
conducted in the context of FA and DDT, they will be discussed in

the next section. Some of the reported tests have also incorporated
the effects of initial turbulence in the enclosure, as well as realistic
obstacles and commercial vent panels; they formed a valuable database
which supported the development and validation of both engineering
correlations and CFD models. In the latter, it was found necessary
to account for the associated hydrodynamic instabilities. Although
some improvements were achieved with more advanced combustion
treatment, they were limited. This could be due to the multi-physics and
multi-scale interaction between turbulence and combustion chemistry,
plus the effects of flame interaction with obstacles; as well as the
limitation in using finer grid resolution in large-scale applications to
mimic the exact geometric configurations in the experiments.

The experimental studies for vented hydrogen deflagrations have
also facilitated renewed efforts to compare the available EMs, which

52

can be used to assist the design of vent panels in practical applications.
A series of development/improvement have been reported for three
EMs [404,431,435]. The new EM developed by Sinha and Wen [435]
based on external flame shape evolution has been accepted for inclusion
in the new release of relevant European standard EN-14994.

5. Flame acceleration (FA) and deflagration to detonation transi-
tion (DDT)

Among all possible accidental combustion events, flame accelera-
tion (FA) followed by detonation onset constitutes the most severe and
destructive event, and is often referred to as deflagration to detonation
transition (DDT). It is usual to distinguish two main steps in the DDT
process corresponding to (i) the creation of the appropriate conditions
for detonation onset, i.e., the FA process, and (ii) detonation onset in
itself. Depending on the authors, DDT may be employed indifferently to
designate the FA and detonation onset processes altogether, or simply
detonation onset alone, as adiabatic-shock ignition abruptly becomes
the driving mechanism of the combustion wave propagation. The FA
and DDT processes are strongly influenced by the confinement and con-
gestion conditions and DDT is usually believed to be hardly achievable
in unconfined volume [436]. However, Oran et al. [61] pointed out
several scenarios which could lead to detonation onset in vapor cloud.
In essence, if a vapor cloud is formed, at least a part of it will likely be
located in a congested area, FA and DDT may occur at this location and
a detonation would propagates in all the volume whose compositions
are within the detonability limits. Other authors [437] claimed that
non-uniformity within the vapor cloud would constrain detonation
propagation to a limited volume. The risk of FA and DDT is particularly
important for hydrogen–air mixtures because of the wide range of
composition for which FA and DDT can take place [20]. In particular,
experimental evidences have demonstrated that, for hydrogen-based
mixtures, much less energetic mixtures could undergo strong FA, and
possibly DDT, as compared to hydrocarbon-based mixtures [20]. Sev-
eral reviews [20,116,438–440] on FA and DDT have been provided
over the years and the interested reader is invited to also consult these
references. In this section, we have considered FA and DDT under
three main situations: (i) confined and unobstructed environments; (ii)
confined and obstructed environments; and (iii) possibly obstructed,
semi-confined and unconfined environments.

5.1. FA and DDT in confined and unobstructed environment

Flame acceleration and DDT in smooth tube are influenced by a
large number of parameters such as the wall smoothness, the dimension
of the tube, the thermodynamic conditions of the fresh mixture, etc.
In the present section, we give an overview of the mechanisms of
FA and DDT in tube/channel typically employed in laboratory-scale
experiments, i.e., with cross-section or diameter typically in the range
2–100 mm. The description also relies on results obtained in numerical
simulation studies. While for many cases, the configuration considered
was a semi-open tube/channel and a weak ignition at the closed-end,
some results obtained in fully-closed channel were also included. Some
authors [20,441] have proposed to divide the FA and DDT processes in
a smooth tube into four main steps: (i) early propagation and pressure
wave formation; (ii) flame instability development and formation of
precursor shock wave; (iii) flame inversion and formation of a shock
train; and (iv) detonation onset. Steps (i), (ii), and (iii) may be classified
as part of the FA process, while step (iv) may be referred to as DDT
process. Nevertheless, in the present paper, we have chosen to simply
consider two phases, the FA phase and the detonation onset phase.

5.1.1. FA and DDT mechanisms
5.1.1.1. Flame acceleration. The evolution of the velocity along the
tube obtained experimentally and numerically is shown in Fig. 60.
Before an abrupt change of the velocity is taking place as a results
of detonation onset, the flame velocity undergoes mainly two phases
of acceleration. Early flame propagation, up to about 0.40–0.45 ms
in Fig. 60(c), may be divided into the following steps [440,442]: (i)
spherical flame; (ii) finger flame; iii) finger flame’s skirt touches the
wall; (iv) tulip flame; and (v) distorted tulip flame. It should be noted
that tulip and distorted tulip flames are not systematically observed.

Following ignition by a weak electric spark near the end-wall,
the flame initially propagates spherically or hemispherically. Due to
confinement, radial expansion of the flame is slowed down and the
propagation preferentially occurs along the tube/channel center-line.
The flame acquires the so-called ‘‘finger-shape’’ [442–446], leading
to an exponential increase of the flame surface, and thus a strong
acceleration of the flame tip, see Fig. 61(a). The strong curvature of
the flame front prevents the development of Darrius–Landau instabil-
ity [446]. The expansion of the gas across the flame front as well as
flame front acceleration generate pressure waves, which heat the fresh
gas and put it into motion. A precursor shock is eventually formed by
coalescence of the acoustic waves. According to the theoretical analysis
of Bychkov et al. [443], the evolution of the flame tip position during
this phase essentially depends on the laminar flame speed and the
expansion ratio. For highly reactive mixtures like hydrogen–oxygen,
such a mechanism can create a sonic flame [444]. Nevertheless, it was
shown by Valiev et al. [446] that significantly lower flame acceleration
could be achieved if the effect of gas compressibility is accounted
for. Despite qualitative consistency for all Lewis number (Le), a flame
propagating in a mixture with Le larger/lower than 1, undergoes
weaker/stronger acceleration [445]. The Schelkin mechanism, which
is related to wall friction and depends on the expansion ratio and the
Reynolds number, also plays a role in early flame acceleration [444].
Despite the exponential increase of the flame tip velocity induced by
the transition from the spherical/hemispherical geometry to the finger
geometry, this mechanism is short-lived [443], since it stops as the
flame skirt touches the wall and the flame front quickly moves along
the wall. The flame surface area dramatically decreases, heat losses are
enhanced, and rarefaction waves are created and overtake the flame
front [447], leading to an abrupt deceleration of the flame.

Following the deceleration of the flame as it contacts the wall,
the flame front flattens and an inversion of the flame can take place
and lead to the formation of the so-called ‘‘tulip flame’’ [442]. This
particular configuration is characterized by the concave shape of the
flame front with respect to the fresh gas and can be formed in a very
wide range of experimental conditions. Fig. 61(a) shows lateral and
oblique views of the tulip flame obtained numerically [450]. As pointed
out by Xiao et al. [450] and Shen et al. [451], many studies have been
performed on the formation and dynamics of the tulip flame. Clanet and
Searby [442], who employed semi-open tubes, indicated that viscosity
and acoustic waves were not the dominant factors for the formation
of tulip flame. They attributed the tulip flame appearance to Taylor
instability triggered by flame deceleration as the flame skirt touches
the wall. While a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain
the phenomenon, including hydrodynamic instability, Rayleigh–Taylor
(RT) instability, interaction of the flame with acoustic wave, vortex
formation in the burnt gas, etc, there is still no universally accepted
mechanism [450,451]. It is noted that several inversions finger–tulip–
finger flame may take place depending on the mixture’ properties and
the channel dimensions [441,450]. Fig. 61(b) illustrates such repeated
inversions which can lead to oscillation of the propagation velocity
with phases of acceleration and phases of deceleration related to the
increase and decrease of the flame surface area. In closed channels
of limited length, the periodic oscillations of the flame velocity are
favored by the interaction of the flame with pressure waves propagating
back and forth along the channel [447]. Experiments performed by

Shen et al. [452] over a range of initial pressures indicated that at sub-

atmospheric pressure, repeated inversions do not occur. They observed

variations of the flame shape along the propagation; the flame evolved
as follows: tulip flame => T-flame => tulip flame => planar flame =>
tulip flame. However, no complete inversion with re-formation of finger

flame was observed as at atmospheric pressure and above.

Under some conditions, the tulip flame may undergo significant
deformation as compared to its classic shape. Xiao et al. [453], the
first to report this particular feature, have proposed the term ‘‘distorted
tulip flame’’ to designate such special tulip flame, which seems to
have been observed mostly in relatively short, fully close channel.
Such a tulip flame is characterized by the appearance of secondary
cusps on the primary lips of the tulip. The trailing feature along the

54

J.X. Wen et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

center-line of the channel/tube of a distorted tulip flame is much
shorter than that of a classic tulip flame. Side and oblique views of the
distorted tulip flame are shown in Fig. 61(a). The shape of the flame
may oscillate between classic and distorted tulip, which can lead to
velocity fluctuations related to flame surface area increase/reduction.
Xiao et al. [447,450] performed experimental and numerical studies to
further understand the formation and dynamics of the distorted tulip
flame. Xiao et al. [450] employed a LES formulation to perform 3D sim-
ulation of flame propagation in a square channel. After demonstrating
the satisfactory agreement between the simulations and experiments,
they focused on the interaction of the flame with the flow and acoustic
wave and attributed the formation of the tulip and distorted tulip
flame to vortex dynamics in the burnt gas slightly away behind the
flame front. The more recent study of Xiao et al. [447] was performed
in 2D and considered a 1-step Arrhenius chemical model to describe
the reactivity of a stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture. While their
simulations tend to confirm the importance of vortical structures in
the burnt gas in creating the tulip flame, it was shown that these
features quickly disappeared and are not involved in the formation of
the distorted tulip flame. They attributed the transition from classic
to distorted tulip flame to the formation of near-wall vortices in the
fresh mixture, which blocks the flame propagation along the wall and
leads to the creation of the secondary cusps propagating toward the
channel center-line. They pointed out the important role of pressure
wave, and their interaction with the curved flame front in triggering
RT instabilities, which are responsible for the formation of the distorted
tulip flame.

Following the end of the early phase, and possibly a period of
deceleration, see Fig. 60, flame acceleration eventually resumes, see
period 0.5–2 ms in Fig. 60(c). Shepherd and Lee [439] pointed out
two potential mechanisms responsible for driving the flame accel-
eration, a fluid-dynamical and a gas-dynamical feedback loop. The
fluid-dynamical feedback loop is related to the intrinsic instability of
high-speed flows. As the flame accelerates, the flow ahead of it becomes
faster and faster, and eventually, an unsteady, turbulent flow is created
in the fresh mixture between the flame and the precursor shock. The
interaction of the flame with the vortical flow stretches and folds the
flame, which increases the energy release rate, which in turn, accelerate
the flame, which in turn promotes turbulent motion within the fresh
mixture, and so on. The gas-dynamical feedback loop is related to the
continuous heating of the fresh mixture by successive acoustic wave
and the flame speed response to this temperature increase. As the flame
propagates into a hotter fluid, it accelerates and creates new pressure
waves, which further heat the fresh mixture, and so on. According
to Shepherd and Lee [439], the fluid-dynamical feedback loop is the
dominant mechanism leading to the formation of fast flame with near-
sonic velocities with respect to the fresh mixture. Nevertheless, Ivanov
et al. [454] performed 3D simulations with detailed chemistry and
argued that the integrated nature of schlieren images over the width of
the channel can lead to miss-interpretation of the experimental results.
For instance, they stated that the flame is not turbulent but rather
highly cellular and laminar. This seems consistent with the statement
of Lee and Moen [438] who pointed out that turbulence rapidly decays
as it propagates in an unobstructed section that follows a section
equipped with obstacles. The analysis of Proust [455] of FA in rather
large scale tubes seems also consistent with the statement of Ivanov
et al. [454]. Based on FA and DDT experiments performed with several
fuel–air mixtures, including H2-air, performed in tube with length of
1.2–30 m and inner diameter of 22–250 mm, it is shown that the
acceleration is rather mixture-dependent than dependent of the tube
diameter. The author argued that these results suggest that turbulence
is not the main phenomenon responsible for FA. Regardless of the exact
mechanism responsible for the second phase of FA, it is important to
point out the formation of a pre-heat zone between the flame and the
precursor shock. The formation of this pre-heat zone is related to shock

coalescence and amplification, and has been viewed as a necessary
element for detonation onset [456].

In terms of flame structure, it is often observed that flame inversion
is taking place during the second phase of FA. As pointed out by
Ciccarelli and Dorofeev [20], this ‘‘new’’ flame inversion is not related
to the tulip flame which is formed during the early stage of the FA
process. The formation of this tulip flame has been usually attributed
to turbulence in the BL. As the BL behind the precursor shock grows, it
eventually becomes turbulent and the flame can propagate faster along
the walls, thus forming a tulip shaped flame. In some cases, apparent
flame inversion can be related to auto-ignition in the boundary layer,
followed by flame propagation along the wall. Such a process has been
observed both experimentally [441] and numerically [457–459], and
was attributed to viscous heating in the boundary layer. Examples of
inverted flames during the second phase of FA are shown in Fig. 62.

Possibly, the formation of a so-called ‘‘strange wave’’ can take place.
It is characterized by the strong coupling of a planar shock wave and
a highly wrinkled funnel-shaped flame which propagates steadily at a
velocity on the order of the speed of sound in the combustion products.
Recently, the formation and dynamics of such a strange wave in semi-
open square channels were studied by Yanez and Kuznetsov [460]
and by Ballossier et al. [461] using high-speed schlieren imaging, as
illustrated in Fig. 63. The authors intended to explain the strange wave
structure by a simple thermodynamic analysis but could not reconcile
experimental and theoretical propagation speeds, unless an energy loss
of 50% was assumed.

5.1.1.2. Detonation onset. According to Lee and Moen [438], detona-
tion onset is universally achieved by formation of strong blast waves
originating from one or several local explosions. Ciccarelli and Doro-
feev [20] distinguished detonation initiation due to (i) shock reflection
or focusing; and (ii) instabilities and mixing processes, including in-
stability at the flame front, flame interaction with a flame, a pressure
wave, a wall, explosion of a quenched pocket of gas, thermodynamic
fluctuations in the flow and boundary layer. The pioneering strobo-
scopic schlieren imaging by Urtiew and Oppenheim [462] has demon-
strated the wide variety of scenarios leading to such local explosion
and strong shock generation. They reported localized explosion at the
flame brush, at the precursor shock, or in between the flame and the
shock. Urtiew and Oppenheim also observed detonation onset induced
by coalescence of a train of shocks. In subsequent reviews after the
work of Urtiew and Oppenheim, Lee and Moen [438], and Shepherd
and Lee [439] indicated that detonation onset is most often taking
place at the flame brush. Some recent studies have focused on exper-
imentally determining the precise location of detonation onset using
two-direction or stereoscopic imaging. Ballossier et al. [441,461,463]
employed a 1.03 m long square channel with 10 × 10 mm2 cross-
section and perform two-direction visualization experiments during
FA and DDT for H2-O2(-N2) mixtures. Despite the change of flame
topology between the undiluted and diluted mixtures, they observed
preferentially detonation onset at the corner of the channel, regardless
of whether or not a strange wave was formed. Recognizing that the
study of Krivosheyev et al. [464] was performed using C2H2-O2-diluent
mixtures and in a cylindrical tube, it is worth mentioning that their
stereoscopic images of the fast flame and DDT events are consistent
with the results of Ballossier et al. [441,461], and show that the very
large majority of the auto-ignition kernels were located in the imme-
diate vicinity of the wall and at a distance of 0.5-0.8 tube diameter
ahead of the main flame. Fig. 64 shows an example of the stereoscopic
imaging performed by Krivosheyev et al. [464].

Significant variability and stochasticity in the exact DDT scenario
was nevertheless pointed out in [441,464]. The preferential ignition in
the close vicinity of the wall is usually attributed to viscous heating in
the boundary layer [448,457]. Many numerical studies also found that
local ignition was taking place in the boundary layer. Dzieminska and
Hayashi [458] and Tang et al. [459] performed FA and DDT simulations

in a channel of 2 mm in height. They used detailed chemistry and con-
sidered a stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture. They found that two, almost
symmetrical, local auto-ignitions took place within the boundary layer.
The flames originating from these explosions propagated preferentially
along the walls, in a first time, and then toward the center of the
channel, in a second time. Upon interaction between the flames, det-
onation onset occurred. Conversely, a funnel-shaped pre-heated zone
formed, and detonation onset resulted from secondary local explosions.
Three dimensional simulations by Machida et al. [465] performed for
a stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture also demonstrated detonation onset at
the corner of the square channel when adiabatic walls where employed.
On the other hand, ignition took place near the center of the channel
when isothermal walls where obtained. Ivanov et al. [454] performed
3D simulations with detailed chemistry and observed detonation onset
at the flame brush, close to a corner. They also indicated that the
location of the detonation onset could be wrongly interpreted from
experimental images as being ahead of the flame, while in fact, it is
taking place in the close vicinity of the flame brush.

Recognizing that local auto-ignition does not necessarily lead to
detonation onset, Lee and Moen [438] and other authors [448] pointed
out the need for the shock wave generated by the local explosion to be
amplified. Before we examine in more details the possible mechanisms
that can lead to the strong amplification of the weak shock wave
formed by local explosion, let us consider the potential implication of
the preheat zone located between the flame and the precursor shock.
According to Liberman et al. [448], the formation of such a pre-heat
zone is a necessary condition for the onset of detonation, regardless of
the exact mechanism leading to the amplification. They argued that the
temperature and length of the pre-heat zone are important factors that
control the restructuration of the temperature profile within the flame,
creating favorable conditions for DDT to occur. Kuznetsov et al. [456]
further examined the role of the preheat zone properties on detonation
onset through schlieren visualization experiments. Their results tend to
show that DDT can take place if the preheat zone is long enough, and
its temperature above a certain threshold.

A first mechanism that can lead to the amplification of the shock
wave formed by relatively weak local explosions, corresponds to the
so-called Zeldovich gradient mechanism [110]. As point out by sev-
eral authors [116,466], a concept similar to the gradient mechanism
corresponds to the Shock Wave Amplification by Coherent Energy
Release (SWACER), which was proposed by Lee et al. [94] to explain
their photochemical detonation initiation experiments. The gradient
mechanism relies on the formation of a spontaneous combustion wave
within a gradient of reactivity induced by temperature or concentration
non-uniformity. Local ignition can take place at the location of highest
reactivity, i.e., the hot spot, and the wave propagates along the gradient
through sequential auto-ignition at a velocity Dw = (∂τ / ∂x)−1, where
τ is the ignition delay-time, and x is the space coordinate. Possible
velocities of the auto-ignition wave range from the laminar flame speed
and up to the speed of light or above [116]. For appropriate values of
the wave propagation speed and of the length of the gradient, detona-
tion onset can be initiated by the coupling of the exothermic reaction
with the acoustic waves generated by the successive ignitions along the
gradient. Gu et al. [467] further studied the required conditions for
successful coupling to take place in a reactivity gradient and proposed
two non-dimensional numbers to characterize the process. The first
non-dimensional parameter, ξ, is defined as the ratio of the local speed
of sound to the velocity of the spontaneous wave. The second non-
dimensional number, ε, corresponds to the ratio of the acoustic to
excitation times. Considering the (ξ − ε) space, the region in which
a detonation can be initiated demonstrates a peninsula shape, often
referred to as the ‘‘detonation peninsula’’. The concept developed by
Gu et al. [467] was extensively studied for a large number of chemical
systems, including hydrogen–air mixtures [468].

On the other hand, Liberman et al. [449,469] and Ivanov et al. [470,
471] argued that the Zeldovich gradient mechanism cannot be phys-
ically realized. Considering that the temperature within the pre-heat

zone is in the range 600–800 K, they pointed out that the ignition delay-
time under such conditions is several orders of magnitude longer that
the entire FA and DDT processes. This observation is consistent with
the gas-dynamical analysis of Meyer et al. [472], who considered a
gas particle located in the pre-heat zone after successive compressions
by the complex wave system formed during FA. They found that the
thermodynamic state of such a particle cannot lead to ignition within
a reasonable amount of time. In addition, Liberman et al. [469,473]
indicated that the length of the hot spot required to trigger detonation
onset under such conditions was unrealistically large. They concluded
that the observation of DDT being initiated by a reactivity gradient in
numerical simulations is an artifact related to the use of 1-step chemical
models, that provide unrealistically short ignition delay-time when
extrapolated to such low temperatures [473]. They also pointed out
that such an event has actually never been reported in experiments or in
numerical simulations performed with detailed chemistry, except when
an idealized hot spot ignition problem is considered as in [467]. Further
recognizing that it is unclear if a reactivity gradient was effectively
formed and what physical mechanism was at work to create it, they
concluded that the pre-heat zone is in fact chemically frozen and
the hot spot ignition and subsequent amplification by the gradient
mechanism is of none importance. To explain detonation onset, they
proposed an alternative mechanism taking place at the edge of the
flame front, and, for simplicity, may be referred to as ‘‘pressure pulse
mechanism’’. Considering that the flame front can be viewed as a semi-
permeable piston, they note that the high-density fresh gas penetrating
the flame is almost instantaneously heated to a very high temperature,
which leads to very fast reaction and the formation of a high-amplitude
pressure pulse. In turn, flame acceleration is re-enforced, leading to
the generation of stronger shocks ahead of the flame, an increase of
the density of the mixture entering the flame, an increase of the heat
release rate, an increase of the pressure pulse amplitude, and so on.
A feedback loop mechanism is established and induces an exponential
increase of the pressure pulse amplitude, which becomes strong enough
to sustain detonation onset. This process is shown in Fig. 65. The
authors emphasized the very narrow character of the pressure pulse and
the very short time required for its transition to a developed detonation.
For completeness, it should be pointed out that, in addition to the
occurrence of local explosion, and to the appropriate conditions for
shock amplification to take place, a third condition exists for successful
detonation propagation to be established. This third condition is re-
lated to the length of the sensitized region in which an over-driven
detonation propagates before being transmitted to the fresh mixture
at its initial thermodynamic state. This aspect has some similarities

with the transmission of a detonation from a sensitive to an insensitive
mixture through a more or less sharp gradient of reactivity [474]. This
phenomenon has been studied in details by Kuznetsov et al. [475],
who showed that sharp gradient can more easily quench detonation
during transmission. Transmission of a detonation through an inert
layer of gas, and subsequent re-initiation or failure, as recently studied
numerically by Tang-Yuk et al. [476], also has a connection with the
phenomenon studied by Kuznetsov et al. [475], although Tang-Yuk
et al. employed a fully inert transition zone characterized by very sharp
interfaces.

The detailed characteristics of the FA and detonation onset pro-
cesses described above can be modulated by various parameters in-
cluding the properties of the mixture and the specific conditions of
the experiments and simulations. Table 6 provides an overview of the
parameters that were investigated in the past 10–15 years. Further
details are provided in the next sub-sections.

5.1.2. Effect of initial conditions in the fresh mixture
5.1.2.1. Effect of composition. As for many other combustion-related
phenomena, the composition of the reactive mixture, i.e., the equiv-
alence ratio and dilution, has very pronounced qualitative and quanti-
tative impacts on the FA and DDT processes. In addition, recent studies
have shown that the non-uniformity of the mixture composition can
have a dramatic effect. In this sub-section, we differentiate the effect
of composition for uniform and non-uniform mixtures.

5.1.2.1.1. Uniform mixtures The effect of composition has been
investigated in several studies [477,479,480,483,483]. Aizawa et al.
[477] and Wang et al. [479] focused on the determination of the DDT
run-up distance. Aizawa et al. [477] obtained U-shape curves. For very
lean or very rich mixtures, DDT may not be observed even for mixtures
without dilution [479]. It seems the position of the minimum run-up
distance as a function of equivalence ratio depends on the dilution
level. While Aizawa et al. [477] reported the minimum is located at the
stoichiometry for hydrogen–air mixtures, Wang et al. [479] reported
that, for undiluted mixtures, the DDT run-up distance gets shorter
as the hydrogen concentration is decreased from 66.7 to 50%. These
latter results appear consistent with the numerical results from Ivanov
and Kiverin [483] who studied the impact of nitrogen-dilution and
equivalence ratio on the FA and DDT processes. While no DDT could
be achieved in H2-air mixtures, for the hydrogen–oxygen mixtures,
DDT was effectively observed [483]. It appears that the evolution of
the DDT run-up distance with Φ does not correlate with the evolution

of the laminar flame speed, whose maximum is located on the rich
side. Wang et al. [479] measured a larger propagation velocity for
the stoichiometric mixture. Ivanov and Kiverin [483] indicated that
DDT took place a bit more/less rapidly in the lean/rich mixture with
Φ=0.9/1.1 [483]. Escofet-Martin et al. [480] reported a maximum
flame velocity and stronger FA for a mixture with 28.9% H2 in air. They
also noted that the flame velocity was larger on the rich side than on
the lean side. The change of equivalence ratio also plays a role on the
flame dynamics [484]. Flame stability and the associated development
of wrinkled flame, play a role in the early flame development and
subsequent FA [483]. For lean mixtures, thermo-diffusive instability
can be readily established, while lower dilution favor the development
of hydrodynamic instability related to the density ratio across the flame
front. For very lean and very rich flames, buoyancy tends to favor
propagation at the top of the channel [453]. The formation of tulip
flame also depends on the equivalence ratio. In a semi-open duct, Xiao
et al. [453] observed tulip flame formation only in the range Φ=1.17–
4.05, whereas they performed experiments in the range Φ=0.1–7.14.
In the case of closed duct, the range of equivalence ratio over which
tulip flames were observed increases to the range Φ=0.50–7.14, with
distorted tulip flame being restricted to the range Φ=0.84–4.22. Much
larger velocity and pressure oscillations were measured in the case of
distorted tulip flame, indicating that combustion is more stable under
conditions leading to classical tulip flame formation.

5.1.2.1.2. Non-uniform mixtures

Vertical concentration gradient
Daubech et al. [485] studied the impact of concentration gradi-
ent on FA in hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen mixtures. The gradients were
formed in a 2 m long vertical tube as two mixtures with different
equivalence ratios and dilutions were put in contact by opening a gate
valve. A sharp flame acceleration, approximately 850 m/s2, took place
over a distance of 20 cm. On the other hand, no significant impact on
the maximum explosion pressure could be observed.

Transverse concentration gradient
Vollmer et al. [486] and Boeck et al. [487,488] studied FA and
DDT processes in an unobstructed channel filled with mixtures demon-
strating transverse concentration gradients. A system of hydrogen jet
along with a precise control of the delay between injection and firing
enabled to create well controlled mixture property gradients. The trans-
verse concentration gradient induces an elongation of the flame which
does not propagate at the bottom of the channel since the mixture
composition at this location is below the lower flammability limit.

The elongation of the flame front results in the increase of the flame
surface area, which in turns induces an increase of the reaction rate in
the mixture with gradient. Such a mechanism induces a faster flame
acceleration and enables the flame to reach higher propagation speeds,
as shown in Fig. 66(a). The run-up distance, defined as the distance
between the ignition point and the location at which the flame velocity
reaches the speed of sound in the reactants, decreases as the steepness
of the concentration gradient is increased, see Fig. 66(b).

A number of numerical studies have considered the configurations
implemented by [486–488,518]. Khodadadi Azadboni et al. [489] stud-
ied the FA and DDT processes in a rich hydrogen–air mixture with
concentration gradient, containing on average 40% H2. Numerical
simulations were performed with detailed chemistry and demonstrated
good quantitative agreement with the experimental results in terms
of evolution of the flame tip velocity along the channel. Consistent
with the experiments, flame propagation at the top of the channel
was favored. The simulation clearly showed the large curvature of the
precursor shock induced by the transverse gradient of sound speed
in the fresh gas. Such a high curvature favored the formation of a
Mach reflections at the bottom, which led to detonation onset. In a
subsequent study, Khodadadi Azadboni et al. [490] studied the impact
of the average equivalence ratio on the FA and DDT in unobstructed
channel, still considering detailed chemistry. For a lean mixture with an
average hydrogen content of 25%, the very significant promotion of FA
and DDT as compared to the homogeneous case was well captured by
the simulation. For a rich mixture with average concentration of 35%,
the promoting effect of the concentration is much less significant, and
this feature was also well reproduced in the simulations.

Effect of mixedness
Other studies have focused on non-premixed or poorly mixed mix-
tures. Aizawa et al. [477] reported no differences on the run-up
distance between premixed and non-premixed conditions for near-
stoichiometric mixtures. On the contrary, the DDT domain appeared to
be wider under non-premixed conditions. Ivanov et al. [491] performed
2D numerical simulations considering fresh mixtures characterized by
randomly distributed pockets of gas whose composition was different
from the average concentration. The size of the spatial perturbation was
varied between 0.25 and 2.5 mm, and the amplitude of the perturbation
was also varied. Small-scale non-uniformities favored the formation of
small-scale wrinkles at the flame front, which significantly increased
the heat release rate and promoted DDT. On the other hand, large-
scale non-uniformities induced large-scale deformation of the flame,
which mitigated FA and DDT. The DDT run-up distance appeared

to be minimum for a given size of the concentration perturbation,
and to also strongly depend on the amplitude of the perturbation.
Lean mixtures were less affected by the spatial non-uniformities than
near-stoichiometric ones.

5.1.2.2. Effect of initial thermodynamic state. A number of studies [479,
492] have investigated the effect of initial pressure. At low enough
pressure, i.e., on the order of 8 kPa, quenching of the flame could
be achieved [479]. As the initial pressure is increased, FA and DDT
are favored. Kuznetsov et al. [492] reported a decrease of the run-
up distance following the law dDDT ∝ P −1.17
. The authors proposed a
simple model to correlate the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer
at DDT (δ) with the detonation cell width (λ) and found that δ = 10λ
or δ = 15λps, depending on whether the initial or the post-shock (ps)
conditions are employed to estimate the cell width. Wang et al. [479]
indicate that DDT could be observed over a wider and wider range of
hydrogen concentration as the initial pressure is increased.

1

Shen et al. [493] and Kuznetsov et al. [494] studied the effect of
cryogenic temperature on the FA and DDT in hydrogen-based mix-
tures. In [493], a H2-O2 mixture with Φ=2.6 was employed at initial
temperature of 77 K, and initial pressure in the range 40–101 kPa.
The tube was closed at both ends, had a length of 1 m and an inner
diameter of 2 cm. They showed that FA is significantly stronger in
cryogenic mixtures, which led to significantly shorter run-up distance
to fast flame formation than under ambient temperature conditions.
The authors also argued that the increased irregularity of the mixture
under cryogenic conditions could increase the detonation domain by
promoting the formation of galloping detonation under near-limit con-
ditions. In [494], experiments were performed at initial temperatures
in the range 90–293 K and initial pressure of 101 kPa. The hydrogen
content was varied between 8 and 60% in air. The tube was 5 m
long and had an inner diameter of 54 mm. At ambient temperature,
DDT was observed only for a mixture containing 30% H2, consistent
with the criterion giving the DDT run-up distance L = 500 λ. Under
cryogenic conditions, ignition below 15% and above 60% H2 could not
be achieved. Nevertheless, detonations were observed for a H2 content
in the range 20%–45%. In the ranges 16–20 and 45%–50% H2, the
authors observed stable propagation of the combustion wave for several
meters at a velocity close to the speed of sound in the combustion
products.

5.1.2.3. Effect of motion in fresh gas. Aizawa et al. [477] determined
the evolution of the DDT run-up distance as a function of the Reynolds
number of the flowing fresh mixture. Non-premixed, near-stoichio-

Re=12,300.

to water condensation at the wall behind the flame front, leading to
lower expansion ratio. Interestingly, the formation of a tulip flame was
suppressed for large enough pores.

5.1.3. Effect of experiment or simulation configuration
5.1.3.1. Effect of ignition source characteristics. Recent studies have es-
sentially focused on the investigation of the effect of the position of the
ignition source. If the ignition source is located just at the end-wall, a
hemispherical flame is initially formed, whereas if the ignition source
is located at some distance from the end-wall, a fully spherical flame is
initially formed. There is a competition between, on the one hand, heat
transfer to the wall and smaller flame surface area, which can delay
flame acceleration if the ignition is close to the wall, and, on the other
hand, the piston-like effect induced by the expansion of the burnt gas
against the end-wall, which would accelerate the DDT process [495].
For relatively large tube/channel cross-section, Blanchard et al. [495]
and Xiao et al. [496] reported that ignition at some distance from the
end-wall, i.e., on the order of few cm, promoted the FA process. On the
contrary, for significantly smaller cross-section, Ballossier et al. [497]
reported an opposite trend and attributed this difference in flame
propagation to the impact of the acoustic wave dynamics, which vary
significantly because of the location of the spark. Using numerical
simulation, Shen et al. [451] showed that an initially planar flame
rapidly evolved to a tulip, and then to a distorted tulip flame. Toward
the end of the channel, the flame front became rather flat again but
demonstrated important wrinkling. They also noted that, despite an
overall qualitative agreement in terms of tulip flame formation and dy-
namics between the initially planar and initially hemispherical ignition
source, the initial and final stages of the flame propagation process
appeared to be significantly affected by the geometry of the ignition
source. In the study of Xiao et al. [496], ignition in the middle of the
test section was also tested and led to the formation of a finger flame,
and then to a rather flat flame with significant front wrinkling, but
no tulip flame formation was observed. Finally, Ballossier et al. [497]
employed two types of igniters characterized by different repetition
rates, 0.5–16 kHz, and different total energy released, 0.12–1.45 mJ.
They found that the total energy provided did not have a significant
effect on the FA process, while the frequency of electrical sparks had a
moderate impact.

5.1.3.2. Effect of wall surface characteristics and of boundary condi-
tions. The effect of porous wall has been tested under two main
configurations. In the first one, the acoustically absorbant material,
i.e., polyurethane foam, basalt wool, or metallic wool, was placed
onto the end-wall [503]. Under such conditions, the higher frequency
acoustic peaks were reduced, but not the low frequency one. The
metallic wool was found to be the most efficient material at reducing
the pressure increase in the tube as well as the flame acceleration. In
the second configuration, the porous material was placed onto the side
wall [498–500]. When using a channel with the largest cross-section,
FA was stronger and the final flame velocity higher in channel equipped
with porous wall when large pores are used. These observations were
made for all equivalence ratios in the range 0.3 to 1. Although small
pores may still lead to slightly higher final flame speed, they result
in the reduction of the pressure. The authors proposed a critical Peclet
number of 40 above which the porous coating significantly affect flame
propagation. When using the channel with the smallest cross-section,
faster flame propagation was observed only for the configurations
with large pores, whereas lower flame speeds were measured for the
configurations with small pores. They also showed that when only
one wall was covered with the porous foam, FA was significantly
weaker than when two porous walls were used. The pores induce
the formation of smaller disturbances on the flame front, which leads
to the formation of a turbulent combustion wave if the mixture is
reactive enough to sustain significant acceleration. For very lean flame,
Φ=0.3, such a turbulization does not take place, which is attributed

Tsarichenko [501] studied the impact of a 1 mm thick moving
(1 m/s) water film at the wall during flame acceleration in a vertical
tube. For all hydrogen contents in the range 15%–30%, the presence of
the water film was found to increase the maximum pressure rise rate.
On the other hand, the maximum pressure measured was higher only
for hydrogen contents in the range 20%–30%, while for 15% hydrogen,
a lower explosion pressure was recorded. The change of maximum
pressure and pressure rise rate for different hydrogen contents were
attributed to two competing phenomena: (i) the film motion promotes
flame acceleration by inducing motion in the fresh gas ahead of the
flame front; while (ii) the evaporation of the water film decreases the
sensitivity of the fresh mixture and decreases the temperature of the
combustion products.

The effect of wall roughness was studied experimentally by Kuznet-
sov et al. [456] and Maeda et al. [502]. In [456], increasing the surface
roughness from 50 to 1000 μm reduces the DDT run-up distance by
approximately 4.5 times. In [502], stronger FA was observed for ex-
periments performed with rough wall, and DDT could not be achieved
in smooth tube. The authors also reported that a tulip flame is more
rapidly established when rough walls are used and that a second flame
front propagates along the walls ahead of the main flame front.

Some studies have also investigated the effects of various bound-
ary conditions on the FA and DDT processes in tube equipped with
smooth wall. For example, Fukuda et al. [504] considered three cases
to determine the impact of boundary conditions: (i) adiabatic or (ii)
isothermal walls without turbulence model, and (iii) adiabatic walls
with the Baldwin–Lomax turbulence model. In case (i), they observed
ignition within the boundary layer, then faster flame propagation along
the wall, and finally, local explosions close to the wall which led to
detonation onset. In case (ii), heat losses at the wall prevented such a
scenario, and faster flame propagation and local explosions leading to
DDT were observed at the center of the channel. In case (iii), although
fast flame propagation along the wall was not observed, the formation
of a hot spot within the boundary layer was effectively observed, and
led to a local explosion and eventually to the onset of detonation.

5.1.3.3. Effect of channel/tube dimensions. Aizawa et al. [477] and
Zhou et al. [506] respectively used experiments and simulations to
determine the effect of the channel/tube size on FA and DDT for
characteristic length from 2.5 to 25 cm. While DDT could not be
observed by Aizawa et al. [477] because of the limited length of their
tubes, they argued that the DDT domain should be larger in tubes with
large diameter because such tubes can accommodate larger cell size in
lean and rich mixtures. The 3D LES simulations of Zhou et al. [506]
indicate that the flame demonstrated cycles of transition from a finger
to tulip flame, and vice versa, with a higher frequency observed for
small cross-section channel. Concerning the flame propagation, small
cross-section favored high velocity at the early stage, while large cross-
section favored high velocity at a latter stage. These features were
respectively attributed to an earlier formation of vortices in small
channels, and to the formation of larger and more intense vortical
motion in large channels. A higher maximum velocity around 500 m/s
was obtained in the channel with the largest cross-section.

In the past years, several studies [470,471,507–510] were per-
formed to better understand the mechanism of FA and DDT in very
narrow tube/channel with characteristics length on the order or below
1 mm. Experiments by Nagai et al. [505] indicated that, as the channel
width was reduced, the range of initial pressure for which DDT oc-
curred became narrower. This was especially true for the mixtures with
Φ=1, while lean and rich mixtures appeared less affected. Although
large variability was observed, the main trend seemed to be that nar-
rower channel promoted short DDT run-up distance. These observations
are supported by the 2D numerical simulations of Ivanov et al. [470,

471] who reported a continuous exponential velocity increase until
DDT took place for a channel height of 0.5 mm. In larger channels,
there is a change of acceleration rate following an initial exponential
phase, which led to a much longer time to DDT. On the other hand,
this is in contrast with the results of Liu et al. [510]. For the largest
channels, FA was observed to take place almost immediately after
ignition, and was attributed to the increase of the flame surface area
by viscous-drag-induced stretching, and to the decrease of the effective
channel width by boundary layer growth. For the smallest channels,
FA was significantly delayed because of too strong viscous drag. A
significant amount of time was required for compression waves to
increase enough the temperature in the unburnt mixture for the flame
to accelerate. Concerning the mechanism of FA and DDT, Bradley and
Shehata [509] examined the possibility that a laminar flame accelerates
and create a shock strong enough to induce DDT in a semi-open tube.
They concluded that the mechanism of acceleration of the laminar
flame can lead to very high gas velocity for tube with inner diameter of
few mm or below. On the other hand, they reported that, for an initial
pressure of 100 kPa, this mechanism alone can explain DDT only for an
initial temperature of 375 K and for a tube diameter in the range 0.5–
1.35 mm. Numerical simulations show that in such narrow channels, a
finger flame would be formed in a first time [507,510]. In a second
time, due to the combined effect of viscous dissipation and shock
compression, the temperature in the boundary layer could increase to
a temperature high enough to trigger auto-ignition at some distance
behind the flame tip [507,510]. The spontaneous combustion wave
formed in the boundary layer progressively accelerates, overcoming the
leading tip, and strengthens the leading shock wave until detonation oc-
curs [507,510]. This process is shown in Fig. 67, as obtained by Houim
et al. [507] by performing 3D numerical simulation with detailed
chemistry. The exact scenario for detonation onset differs depending
on which study is considered. In Liu et al. [510], detonation onset was
a result of the collision of two flame fronts. Ivanov et al. [470,471]
attributed such an event to the pressure pulse mechanism. Finally,

Houim et al. [507] argued that it was triggered due to the temperature
gradient between the side and the center of the tube.

We also note the recent studies of Kuznetsov and Grune [511] and
Veiga-López et al. [512] on the modes of flame propagation in a thin
layer, 1 to 10 mm. In all cases, no sonic flame or detonation could be
achieved in unobstructed channels. This was attributed to the too short
length of the facility, 20 to 90 cm. In [512], flame propagation was
observed for a H2 content in air as low as 4.5%. At larger concentrations
but still below 10%, they observed steady propagation of flame cells
either isolated or describing fractal-like patterns.

5.1.3.4. Effect of channel/tube shape. A number of studies have exam-
ined the characteristics of the FA process in tee-shaped and bended
pipes, which are widely used configurations in industrial settings.
Emami et al. [481,482] reported that maximum flame speed and over-
pressure were lower in the case of a tee-shaped tube than for bended
pipes. Zhou et al. [513] reported that in their experiments, the flame
velocity was maximum in the straight part of the tube and minimum
in the bended part of the tube. The flame was found to re-accelerate
in the tube located after the bend. Similar trends were observed for
the pressure signal. It was also shown that the pressure in the concave
part of the bend was higher than in the convex part. More insight were
obtained by Mei et al. [514] in their 3D LES study of the impact of
the bend angle on the FA process. Some of their results are shown
in Fig. 68. Within the straight part of the tube, the presence of the
bend and its angle influenced the pressure dynamics, which in turn
modified the shape of the tulip flame formed after flow reversal, as
well as the velocity of the flame as it reached the bend. Because the
pressure is higher in the concave part of the bend, the flame propagates
preferentially along the convex surface, which results in a tongue-like
flame. The extent of this phenomenon depends on the bend’s angle,
and the flame speed at the bend location decreases as the bend angle
increases. The maximum flame velocity in the pipe, reached before the
bend, varied non-uniformly with the bend angle and is maximum for
a 90◦ bend, but is however lower than in the straight tube. It was
also found that the elbow significantly promoted pressure oscillations
during the FA process, especially for a large angle such as 150◦.

5.1.3.5. Effect of channel/tube opening. Xiao et al. [515] studied the
effect of partial opening on the characteristic of the FA process. The
opening ratio, open area (α) over cross-section area, was varied be-
tween 0.019 and 0.187. For small α, the flame dynamics was similar
to that observed in a fully closed channel, with the formation of
pronounced tulip and distorted tulip flames. As α was increased, the
formation of the tulip flame became less and less obvious. Higher flame
speed and more pronounced flame speed oscillations occurred as α was
increased. On the other hand, larger maximum pressure and pressure
oscillations were observed for small α.

Bykov et al. [516] have recently studied FA and DDT in a 1.8 m-long
square channels opened at both ends. The cross-sections were 4 × 4 to
20 × 20 mm2. In all cases, hydrogen–oxygen mixtures with a H2 content
in the range 15%–90% were employed. Because no piston effect is
induced in such a fully open channel, the flame propagated at low and
constant speed until the second half of the channel. Suddenly, strong
oscillations of the flame velocity were observed, followed by very rapid
acceleration and formation of a detonation, as shown in Fig. 69. A
strange wave was observed before DDT occurred, and detonation onset
was attributed to a ‘‘shockless mechanism’’. They interpreted their data
based on the Σ2 model. They found that neither hydraulic resistance
alone nor flame folding alone can explain the flame acceleration and

DDT. They indicated that a positive feedback exists between hydraulic

resistance and flame folding, which can lead to DDT.

conservation. Behind the obstacles, large-scale vortical motion is cre-
ated in the fresh gas. According to the numerical study of Qin and
Chen [524], the main cause of vorticity behind the obstacles corre-
sponds to baroclinic torque induced by the miss-aligned density and
pressure gradients generated in the fresh mixture as the flame propa-
gates. As the flame reaches the obstacles, it gets strongly accelerated
in the unrestricted area; the flame evolves from a finger flame to a tip-
shaped flame [521], or jet-like shape [523]. After passing through the
unrestricted area, the flame evolves to a mushroom-like shape [521,
525] and gets progressively entrained by the vortices generated be-
tween the obstacles [523,525]. These interactions lead to strongly
stretched and folded flames, whose convoluted surface area increases,
see Fig. 71.

While the velocity of the flame tip increases as the flame propa-
gates in the unrestricted area, it tends to decrease when propagating
between two obstacles, which results in an oscillating increasing trend
of the velocity along the channel axis [525]. The increased flame
surface area enables faster heat release rate, which accelerates the
flame and, in turn, accelerate the flow in the fresh gas between the
obstacles. At this stage, no or little turbulence is involved in this
feedback loop mechanism [20], and the feedback mechanism is driven
by flame–vortex interaction. Further increase of the flame surface area
is provided by Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities, which lead to small-
scale wrinkling of the flame front [524]. As the flame continuously
accelerates, the velocity in the fresh gas increases, leading to flow
detachment off the obstacle edges and to the creation of unstable shear
layers [525]. Small-scale motion is created in the fresh mixture, and
the flow progressively become turbulent. Turbulent recirculation zones
are created between the obstacles. As the flame propagates, the fractal
dimension of the flame progressively increases and reaches 1.5–1.7
after it has passed through several obstacles [524]. The high turbulence
intensity in the fresh gas makes the flame turbulent, which in turns
further increases the heat release rate, and accelerates the flame, and
so on. This second feedback loop involved in the FA process may
be referred to as ‘‘turbulent feedback loop’’. At this stage, the flame
velocity may significantly drop if the reactivity of the mixture is too
low to sustain such an intense turbulence [20]. Otherwise, the flame
continues to accelerate and becomes super-sonic with respect to the
fresh mixture at rest; relatively strong shocks propagating ahead of
the flame are formed and their dynamics start to significantly influ-
ence flame acceleration. Shock reflecting off the obstacles and side
walls interact with the flame and trigger and/or re-enforce a number
of instability mechanisms, including Richtmyer–Meshkov (RM) and
Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instabilities [520,523], which increase flame
surface area and enhance turbulent mixing [466]. A new feedback loop
is created; the instabilities further strengthen the heat release rate,
which in turn, further strengthen the shock waves. Boeck et al. [526]
studied the dynamics of shock–flame complex in the fast-flame regime
in an obstacle-laden channel using OH-PLIF and schlieren visualization,
see Fig. 72. They observed that, in this fast-flame regime, the flow
field dynamics is essentially controlled by precursor shock waves. They
also mentioned that shock–flame interaction seems to be the main
phenomenon for the development of small-scale flame perturbations,
dominating over turbulent combustion in the recirculation zones be-
tween the obstacles. The stronger shocks enhance flame acceleration by
increasing the temperature of the unreacted gas. The turbulent flame–
shock complex may reach a velocity close to the speed of sound in
the combustion products, i.e., in the range 800–1000 m/s, and enters
the regime of chocked flame. Ciccarelli and Dorofeev [20] as well
as Kiverin et al. [527] proposed detailed discussions concerning the
formation and dynamics of chocked flame. Eventually, the combustion
wave may continue propagating as a chocked flame, or may transit to
detonation [20].

For completeness, we note that an alternative mechanism of flame
acceleration has been proposed by Bychkov et al. [528] for chan-
nel obstructed by thin and tightly spaced obstacles. In such a spe-
cific configuration, the exponential increase of the flame tip veloc-
ity is driven by a jetflow originating from the delayed burning of

5.1.3.6. Effect of external energy addition.
Ivanov et al. [517] studied
numerically the effect of energy addition ahead of a flame on the FA
and DDT process in a semi-open channel. In particular, it was verified if
the additional flame deformation induced by a small energy input could
promote DDT. When no-slip conditions were imposed at the wall, the
energy input ahead of the flame induced a significantly faster FA and
DDT.

5.2. FA and DDT in confined and obstructed environment

The study of flame acceleration and detonation onset in obstructed
tube/channel is of primary importance to develop safety guidelines
for various industrial activities, and mitigate and prevent dramatic
accidental combustion events. The interactions of the flame-induced
flow with the obstruction provide very powerful mechanisms for ac-
celerating the flame, and detonation can be readily established under
such conditions. There is an almost infinite number of possible configu-
rations when considering the different numbers, shapes, arrangements,
blockage ratios (BR), etc, of the obstacles placed in the tube/channel.
According to Gamezo et al. [519], there are three main steps in the DDT
process in obstructed channels: (i) flame acceleration, or creation of the
required conditions for DDT to take place; (ii) detonation onset; and
(iii) detonation propagation. In the following sub-sections, we provide
a detailed description of phenomena (i) and (ii), while (iii) is treated
separately in the following chapter. In addition, a comprehensive re-
view of the effects of many parameters on the FA and DDT processes
in hydrogen-based mixtures is given. While, the following descriptions
intent to focus on the general aspects of the FA and DDT processes in
obstructed channel, some of the features we describe could be somehow
specific to the widely employed configuration consisting of a channel
equipped with repeated fence-like obstacles [520–522].

5.2.1. FA and DDT mechanisms
5.2.1.1. Flame acceleration. The typical evolution of the flame velocity
during FA and DDT in an obstructed channel obtained from a numerical
simulation by Lu et al. [522] is shown in Fig. 70. FA in channel
obstructed by repeated obstacles is a complex process and may be
divided into two main steps. During the early phase, shocks are not
involved and the acceleration is mostly related to the interaction of the
flame with the flow, while turbulence is progressively being activated
and turbulent combustion in recirculation zones between the obstacles
play an important role. During the second phase of FA, the flame–shock
interactions and associated instabilities play a fundamental role and
support the generation of high turbulence intensity [523].

Following ignition and early propagation, the expansion of the
initially laminar flame creates motion in the fresh mixture. At the
obstacles, the flow is accelerated in the unrestricted area due to mass

the reactive mixture between the obstacles. This mechanism was also
studied by Huang et al. [529], and in a subsequent study, Adebiyi
et al. [530] demonstrated that thermo-diffusive instability, character-
istic of lean hydrogen–air mixtures, strengthen the jetflow-induced FA
mechanism and leads to even faster flame propagation. On the other
hand, flame acceleration is weakened for mixtures with Le above unity,
representative of rich hydrogen–air mixtures.

5.2.1.2. Detonation onset. As the flame reaches a velocity close to the
speed of sound in the combustion products, detonation onset may take
place. Oran and Gamezo [116] pointed out that, in their simulations,
detonation onset was always achieved through the Zeldovich’s gradient
mechanism; gradients being formed by turbulent mixing of reacting
and unreacted gas, or through flame–flame, flame–shock, or flame–
vortex interactions [520]. A typical scenario involving the gradient
mechanism corresponds to the formation of a Mach stem by interaction
of the curved leading shock with the side wall, Mach stem reflection off
an obstacle, hot spot ignition(s), amplification of the resulting acoustic
wave within the surrounding gradient, and detonation onset. Possibly,
the amplification process can fail to induce detonation onset; in this
case, the fast flame and shock propagating from the hot spot may
induce other local ignitions, which themselves, will lead to successful
detonation onset [520]. Hot spot may arise from other locations includ-
ing contact surfaces, the turbulent flame brush, turbulent flame funnels,
and intense vortical structures [466]. Using idealized configurations,
Houim and Taylor [531] demonstrated that, regardless of whether a 1-
step or detailed reaction model was used, shock–flame interaction can
lead to the formation of hot spots and reactivity gradients, and even-
tually to detonation onset. Detonation onset through the interaction of
a finger flame with a shock wave was also studied experimentally and
numerically by Yang and Radulescu [532]. They confirmed that such
events can lead to rapid DDT onset. In general, the great importance
of interactions at the obstacle–wall corners in triggering DDT has
been underlined. As pointed out previously in the present review, the
involvement of the gradient mechanism in detonation onset has been a
topic of controversy for the past 12 years or so, and some authors have
considered such a feature to be an artifact related to the utilization
of 1-step chemical model [449]. In obstructed channel, the complex
flow field, as well as shock–flame and shock–shock interactions further
complicate the interpretation of the detonation onset events.

In their numerical simulations performed with a simplified 1-step
chemical model, Heidari and Wen [466] observed that local auto-
ignition was not restricted to the corners and that several hot spots
at different locations could be formed. On the other hand, they indi-
cated that the amplification process was compatible with the SWACER

mechanism. When they performed additional simulations using a de-
tailed reaction model, the time and distance to DDT were noticeably
increased. Lu et al. [522] argued that the choice of the physical
target employed to calibrate a 1-step chemical-diffusive model, ei-
ther the theoretical half-reaction length or the experimental cell size,
could significantly impact the simulation outcome. Using the experi-
mental cell size as the calibration target leads to a significantly less
sensitive mixture which undergoes fewer local explosions during the
pre-detonation period. Nevertheless, they observed qualitatively similar
DDT events at the obstacle–wall corner. Quantitative differences in
term of propagation trajectories were observed for channel of inter-
mediate heights for which the detonation cell size controls the mode
of propagation, either galloping detonation or quasi-detonation. For
the smallest and largest channels, no significant difference could be
observed. They recommended to use the experimental cell size as the
target for calibration in future work. Xiao et al. [534] specifically
investigated the possibility of detonation initiation by shock focusing.
They employed numerical simulations performed with a 1-step model
and considered an idealized collision between two shocks. They found
that direct initiation could be achieved only when two strong shocks
(M=3) collide with each other. When weaker shocks (M=2-2.7) were
considered, detonation onset was achieved by the gradient mechanism.
Dounia et al. [533] numerically investigated the effect of chemical
kinetics on the detonation onset in a 2D channel equipped with fence-
like obstacles. They observed that the DDT run-up distance obtained
when considering a 1-step chemical model was significantly longer
than the one obtained with detailed chemistry. This is illustrated in
Fig. 73, where it is also visible that the DDT onset location is different
when 1-step or detailed chemistry was used. Consistent with previous
numerical studies performed in unobstructed channel with detailed
chemistry [449,471], Dounia et al. found that DDT is initiated by a
pressure pulse created at the flame brush by shock focusing. Using high-
speed schlieren imaging, Obara et al. [535] studied experimentally the
DDT event in a channel equipped with repeated fence-like obstacles.
They employed a stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture and varied the obstacle
height, spacing, and the initial pressure to favor the occurrence of DDT.
They identified two mechanisms leading to the onset of the detonation.
In a first mechanism, the spacing between the obstacle is large, and
detonation was initiated at the flame front behind an obstacle as the
reflected shock interacted with the flame. The local explosion generated
a large amount of white light and led to the formation of a detonation
at some distance from the wall. This mechanism seems consistent with
the numerical observations of Dounia et al. [533] and others [449,471],
who attributed the onset of detonation to a pressure pulse in the vicinity

of the flame brush. In a second mechanism, the spacing between the
obstacle is small, and DDT was attributed to accumulation of weak
shock waves generated by weak local explosions between the obstacles.
Nevertheless, it is not always required that the flame reaches a
propagation speed equal to that of the speed of sound in the combus-
tion products for detonation onset to take place. Maeda et al. [536]
performed DDT experiments in a channel equipped with fence obstacle
at the bottom wall and used a stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture. When
using obstacles with BR of 0.05 and 0.1, they observed detonation
onset significantly before the flame could reach the speed of sound
in the products. They attributed the onset of detonation to volumetric

explosion taking place between the obstacles following unreacted and
reacted gas mixing by flame–vortex interaction. They argued that the
large obstacle spacing may be an important aspect of such a detonation
onset event. More recently, Li et al. [537] also observed detonation
onset before the flame has reached the speed of sound in the products.
They employed a stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture and performed exper-
iments in a channel equipped with continuous triangular obstacles.
For BR=0.1, they observed DDT as the flame had accelerated only to
740 m/s, significantly below the speed of sound in the products, about
1200 m/s. They pointed out that, for such a highly reactive mixture,

5.2.2. Regimes of flame propagation in obstructed channel

Using the final speed of the combustion wave as the criterion,
Peraldi et al. [539] proposed four different regimes of flame propa-
gation. These regimes are shown in Fig. 74 for flames propagating
in hydrogen–air mixtures in a tube filled with obstacles. In the slow
flame/quenching regime, the turbulence is too intense and induces
local quenching. This leads to a lower burning rate, and a largely sub-
sonic propagation. The flame speed is on the order of few hundreds
of m/s. Possibly, the combustion process can be fully quenched. If
the mixture can sustain intense turbulence, the flame becomes a fast
turbulent flame, and can accelerate until a propagation speed in the
range 600–1100 m/s is reached. In this range, the propagation velocity
is close to the speed of sound in the combustion products; the flame is
largely supersonic with respect to the fresh gas. This regime is usually
referred to as regime of ‘‘chocked flame’’. In this case, the propagation
speed may remain constant over large distances and is controlled by
the thermodynamic conditions and the properties of the mixture. If the
characteristic length between the obstacles is larger than the detonation
cell size (λ), DDT may occur; the detonation is propagating with a
quasi-constant speed but much lower than the theoretical Chapman–
Jouguet velocity. This is due to successive failure/re-initiation cycles
induced by the obstacles. This regime is usually referred to as ‘‘quasi-
detonation regime’’. If the characteristic length between the obstacles
is larger than approximately 13λ, then the influence of the obstacles
is limited and the propagation velocity is close to the CJ speed. As
pointed out by Chao and Lee [544], depending on the obstacles type
and configuration, the transition between the different regimes may
take place at different mixture compositions and can be smooth rather
than abrupt. They also emphasized that significant velocity fluctuations
can take place.

The detailed characteristics of the FA and detonation onset pro-
cesses, as well as the regimes of flame propagation in obstructed
channel are influenced by a large variety of parameters. Table 7 sum-
marizes these parameters and their effects. The complexity of the FA
and DDT processes makes it very difficult to isolate the effect of a single
parameter, whose impact might be promoting or inhibiting depending
on their own value, and on the values of other parameters. Additional
insights are provided in the next sub-sections.

5.2.3. Effect of initial conditions in the fresh mixture
5.2.3.1. Effect of composition.

5.2.3.1.1. Uniform mixtures Dorofeev et al. [545] analyzed a
large amount of experimental FA and DDT data obtained in obstructed
channels with different BR. Hydrogen–oxygen mixtures at various tem-
perature and pressure, and diluted with various diluents were consid-
ered along with hydrocarbon-based mixtures. They developed a simple
correlation that predicts the limit between fast and slow flames based
on the intrinsic mixture’s properties. The basic idea on which the model

shock compression and viscous heating in the BL could readily trigger
ignition and subsequent detonation onset.

For completeness, it is noted that, detonation onset may also take
place according to the turbulent jet ignition mechanism [438,541]. In
this case, detonation is initiated as a result of the strong turbulent
mixing of a stream of hot reacting gas with the fresh mixture, which
creates both the conditions for local explosion to be initiated, and
the reactivity gradient required for amplifying the resulting shock and
ensuring detonation onset [438]. While such an ignition event can be
initiated at the laboratory scale when using highly reactive mixtures
(fuel–oxygen), a large-scale facility is required when using less reactive
mixtures (fuel–air). Dorofeev et al. [541] performed a comprehensive
parametric study of jet ignition in hydrogen–air mixtures and observed
local detonation initiation under certain conditions. They found that
only mixtures with hydrogen contents in the range 25%–35% could
support local detonation onset, and that the size of the jet was the dom-
inant parameter that controlled the regime of combustion, turbulent
deflagration or local detonation. In obstructed tube/channel, such an
ignition event is favored by a limited number of obstacles and a very
high blockage ratio [542,543]. In such confined environments, the jet
can further interact with the precursor shock wave and with the walls,
which may favor detonation onset and its sustenance, while the exact
ignition mechanism might differ as compared to the one observed at
large scale.

relies is that the piston-effect, i.e., the expansion across the flame,
provides a mechanism for the flame to resist quenching by turbulent
motion. Since the propensity of the flame to resist turbulence-induced
quenching decreases as the Zeldovich number (β), or activation energy,
of the flame increases, stronger expansion ratio is required for fast
flame to be formed in mixtures with large activation energy. The effect
of composition on FA can thus be assessed through their effects on
the expansion ratio (σ) and on β. For hydrogen–air mixtures [349], σ
decreases away from the stoichiometry, while the Zeldovich number
decreases as the equivalence ratio is increased from 0.6 to 1.5, and then
plateaus up to Φ=2. Thus, near-stoichiometric mixtures have a higher
propensity for generating fast flame than off-stoichiometric ones. Ad-
dition of a diluent, such as water, would reduce σ, and decrease the
range of equivalence ratio over which fast flame can be observed. The
results of Kumar [546], Card et al. [547], and Teodorczyk et al. [548]
seem consistent with the observations of Dorofeev et al. [545], although
Card et al. [547] reported a minimum run-up distance for slightly rich
mixtures with Φ in the range 1.2–1.4. On the other hand, Kuznetsov
et al. [549] found that, for mixtures with the same cell width, the
potential for DDT was higher for mixtures with an irregular cellular
structure than for mixtures with a regular structure. These results
would indicate that mixtures with high activation energy could more
easily undergo FA and DDT. Although near-stoichiometric mixtures
are the most prone to FA and DDT, such events may also take place
in lean mixtures. Recent large-scale numerical simulations performed
by Hasslberger et al. [550] show that, in a pressurized water reactor
building, FA and DDT occurred for a homogeneous mixture with a H2
content as low as 17.5% in air at 293 K and 101 kPa.

5.2.3.1.2. Non-uniform mixtures

Vertical concentration gradient:
The effect of vertical concentration gradient was investigated at
different scales by Cheikhravat [551] and Kudriakov et al. [552]. For
a laboratory-scale facility, Cheikhravat [551] reported larger flame
velocity for mixtures with a negative gradient than for homogeneous
mixtures and for mixtures with a positive gradient. Hydrogen content
was in the range 10.5%–13%. The results appear different in the
large-scale facility HYKA. For an homogeneous mixture containing 9%
H2, a maximum flame velocity of 35 m/s was reported. For negative
gradients with average content of H2 in the range 9%–10%, maximum

flame speeds in the range 80–100 m/s were recorded. Finally, for
positive gradients with average contents of H2 in the range 8%–9%,
the maximum flame speed was similar, 100–130 m/s for ignition at
the bottom of the facility, or much higher, 620–750 m/s, for ignition
at the top of the facility. Higher over-pressures and pressure rise rates
were measured for mixtures with gradients, in particular for positive
gradients and ignition at the top of the facility. Corresponding large-
scale numerical simulations showed satisfactory agreement with the
experimental results.

Transverse concentration gradient:
Vollmer et al. [486,553] and Boeck et al. [487,488] studied the
effect of transverse concentration gradient in obstructed channel. Schli-
eren imaging demonstrated that for experiments performed for mix-
tures with a concentration gradient, the interaction of the flame with
the flow generated behind the obstacles leads to a more distributed
flame front across the height of the channel. This increases the energy
release rate and enables the flame to propagate in region with lower
equivalence ratio. Fig. 75 shows the maximum flame propagation
velocity along with the distance to reach the sound speed in the
reactants (run-up distance) in an obstructed channel for mixtures with
and without concentration gradient. Unlike what was observed in the
unobstructed channel, transverse concentration gradients appear to
have either little or significant influence on the FA and DDT processes,
depending on the specific experimental configuration employed [553].
For mixtures with gradients, the 7λ criterion [581] could either suc-
cessfully predicts the critical concentration for DDT to occur, or simply
fails to provide an accurate estimate. The choice of the concentration at
which the cell width should be taken to apply the 7λ criterion remains
unclear. The concentration gradients tend to reduce/increase the DDT
run-up distance for lean/rich average concentrations.

The experimental configurations presented above [486–488,518,
553] served as benchmarks for many numerical simulation studies. A
large number of parameters were investigated, including the hydrogen
content, gradient steepness, BR, and the obstacle spacing [489,554,
558,559]. In general, reasonable agreement was observed between
the simulations and the experiments when considering the flame tip
trajectory, the evolution of the flame velocity along the channel,
the DDT run-up distance, and the pressure signal [489,554–557].
The promoting/inhibiting effect of gradient in lean/rich mixtures was

also well captured by the simulations [554,559]. Khodadadi Azadboni
et al. [490] noted that the concentration gradients favor the develop-
ment of KH and RM instabilities during the DDT process. Fig. 76 shows
the detonation onset observed for a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous
30% hydrogen–air mixture in an obstructed channel [557]. The loca-
tion and mechanism of detonation onset appear to vary depending on
the exact parameters used in each study. In several studies, detonation
onset was observed to take place at the top of the channel, in a
hydrogen-rich region [555,559]. Detonation onset may be triggered
at one or several locations as the precursor shock reflects off the
top, bottom, or side wall, or off the obstacles [489]. Local ignition
in the pre-heat zone between the shock and the flame may also lead
to detonation onset [558,559]. Shamsadin Saeid et al. [559] reported
that for a steep gradient, the explosion center was located at the triple
point of the Mach reflection formed along the bottom wall. For less
steep gradient, local explosions leading to detonation onset were due
to the focusing of the shocks reflected from the obstacles or through
reflected shock–flame interaction. The exact location and mechanism
of detonation onset are modulated by different parameters such as the
equivalence ratio, or the obstacle spacing [558]. Following detonation
onset, the presence of gradient may also influence the propagation of
the developed detonation. In particular, Ettner et al. [554] reported
that for very steep gradient, very high pressure can be generated in
region in which the hydrogen content is too low to sustain detonation
at ambient temperature and pressure. This particular feature was
attributed to the formation of a Mach reflection at the bottom wall
due to the pronounced curvature of the shock front. Some authors
also pointed out the risk of secondary explosion related to the large
amount of unburnt hydrogen due to poor burning efficiency in the
hydrogen-rich regions [555].

Hasslberger et al. [550,560] numerically studied the impact of
transverse concentration gradient in a large-scale facilities, i.e., RUT
obstructed channel and Konvoi-type pressurized water reactor. They
employed a coupled flamelet deflagration model and a two-step auto-
ignition model to describe the reactivity of the hydrogen–air mixtures.
Considering the obstructed channel, they observed that DDT could be
achieved at an average concentration of 13% H2 in air when a gradient
was imposed, whereas only a fast flame could be formed without
gradient. Considering the pressurized water reactor, the concentration
gradient was found to induce faster FA and to trigger DDT significantly
earlier than for the corresponding homogeneous case.

5.2.3.2. Effect of initial thermodynamic state.
In the past 25 years, it
seems only a limited number of studies have investigated the effect
of initial pressure. Kumar [546] reported that, over the range 50 to
100 kPa, the maximum flame speed demonstrated only weak variations.
Scarpa et al. [561], who studied lean flames propagating in a tube
equipped with 24, equally-spaced obstacles with a BR of 0.3, indicated
that no significant difference could be observed for the flame velocity
profiles for initial pressures from 60 to 400 kPa.

A larger number of studies have been performed on the effect of
initial temperature. As previously mentioned, Dorofeev et al. [545]
developed a model to determine the potential of mixtures under given
conditions to generate fast flame. They mentioned that elevated ini-
tial temperature tends to decrease the critical σ required for fast
flame to be formed. They noted that β, and thus the potential for
turbulence-induced flame quenching, decreases as the initial temper-
ature is increased. This indicates that high initial temperature would
favor FA and DDT. This seems consistent with the numerical results
of Hasslberger et al. [550] and Heidari and Wen [466] obtained with
lean mixtures. On the contrary, Card et al. [547] reported that the
DDT run-up distance increased slightly as the initial temperature is
raised from 300 to 473 and to 573 K. Recently, Kuznetsov et al. [494]
studied FA and DDT in obstructed channel with BR=0.3 and 0.6 for
hydrogen–air mixtures under cryogenic conditions. The experiments
were performed in a 5 m long tube with inner diameter of 54 mm,
equipped with orifice-plate obstacles. Mixtures with hydrogen contents
in the range 8%–60% with initial temperature between 90 and 293 K
were employed. At ambient temperature, the critical expansion ratio
for fast flame propagation to be achieved was found to be 3.75, which
is consistent with previous results. On the other hand, this critical value
increases to 12.5 under cryogenic conditions, which led to a critical H2
concentration of 16% for fast flame to be formed. The evolution of the
critical expansion ratio as a function of initial temperature is shown in
Fig. 77. Detonation was observed for hydrogen contents above 19.5%
for BR=0.3, and only for a content of 30% for BR=0.6.

5.2.3.3. Effect of motion in fresh gas. Gray et al. [562] studied the effect
of motion in the fresh gas in an obstructed channel with BR=0.43.
The stoichiometric H2-air mixture was either quiescent or in motion
with velocity up to 8.2 m/s. For the quiescent mixture, the flame was
laminar and large-scale vortices were created between the obstacles.
Motion in the fresh gas favored the formation of a turbulent flame and
induced more rapid FA and larger maximum flame velocities.

5.2.3.4. Effect of radiative losses. Krishnamoorthy and Mulenga [563]
investigated the effect of radiative losses in lean hydrogen–air mixture
with Φ=0.5 at initial pressure from 10 to 303 kPa. Fence-like obstacles
with BR of 0.51 were employed. Radiative losses by water vapor
decrease the temperature of the combustion wave, which resulted in a
lower propagation velocity, and longer run-up distance to fast flame or
quasi-detonation formation. Maximum temperature and pressure were
lower in the radiating combustion wave. These effects were stronger
at high initial pressure. At 303 kPa, radiative losses represent up to
85% of the total heat losses during the FA stage, and up to 50% in the
quasi-detonation stage.

5.2.4. Effect of experiment or simulation configuration
5.2.4.1. Effect of ignition source characteristics. A limited number of
experimental studies have investigated the effect of ignition source
characteristics. Considering a vertical, large-scale facility, Kudriakov
et al. [552] found that much higher flame speeds, 6–7 times, could be
reached when ignition was performed at the top of the tube instead
of at the bottom. In a horizontal tube, Coates et al. [565] reported no
significant impact of the position nor of the strength of the ignition
source. Zheng and Wang [564] compared the DDT characteristics in

channels equipped with repetitive orifice plates when a classical spark
plug or a plasma initiator was employed to ignite the flame. They
reported a reduction of 60% of the time to detonation onset. They
attributed the faster DDT process to the ability of the plasma to create
electrons and free radicals within a large volume.

In addition, few numerical studies have examined the effect of
various aspect of the ignition system. Considering a Konvoi-type pres-
surized water reactor, Hasslberger et al. [550] reported that FA was
stronger when ignition was located at the bottom of the reactor,
whereas DDT occurred in any cases. Some studies have determined
the effect of the ignition source strength. While Gamezo et al. [520]
observed that, for an increase by 25 times of the ignition energy,
an initial shock wave was formed and led to a significantly faster
detonation onset, Heidari and Wen [566] reported detonation onset
in the vicinity of the flame brush and no contribution to detonation
onset of shock reflection at the obstacle as they increased their hot spot
temperatures from 2000 to 3000 K.

5.2.4.2. Effect of channel/tube configuration and dimensions.

5.2.4.2.1. Effect of obstacle blockage ratio, spacing and layout The
influence of obstacles in the FA and DDT processes is of primary

69

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

importance. A very large number of configurations can be considered
in terms of obstacles relative size (or BR), number, spacing, and lay-
out/arrangement, and can potentially lead to very specific behaviors
during both the FA and DDT stages. In this section, we successively
examine the impact of the obstacles blockage ratio, spacing, and layout.

Blockage ratio:
Because the blockage ratio is one of the most important parameters
for FA and DDT, a very large number of studies are available in the
literature concerning its effect. Various configurations with different
numbers and types of obstacles were employed. In general, increasing
BR tends to favor FA because it can promote strong turbulence. On
the other hand, a too high BR may delay DDT or prevent detonation
propagation. Nevertheless, some configurations with low or high BR
may also promote DDT under specific conditions. In the following, we
have differentiated the studies performed with one or two obstacles,
and those performed with a larger number of repeated obstacles. We
also mention the particular case of bank of obstacles which has been
studied in some recent papers.

Studying FA and DDT in a tube/channel equipped with a small num-
ber of obstacles provides insights into the effect of BR on the interaction
of the flame with obstacles, without generating a too complex flow
field. Qin and Chen [524] performed a comprehensive 2D numerical
study for a single fence-like obstacle configuration. Before the obstacles,
the flame evolves from spherical to finger flame. As it passes between
the two obstacles, a tip flame is formed and evolves into a mushroom
flame, and later into a twisted flame. The transition from finger to
tip flame is more pronounced as BR increases, and is accompanied by
a faster flame propagation velocity between the two obstacles. This
feature was attributed to the larger flow velocity and larger pressure-
gradient induced by obstacles with larger BR. At higher BR, larger
recirculation zones were created behind the obstacles due to vorticity
generated by baroclinic torque. Simultaneous OH-PLIF and schlieren
imaging by Boeck et al. [567] clearly indicated that the tip of the flame
remained laminar, while the edges became progressively wrinkled upon
interaction with vortices shed off the obstacle edge and the flame
propagated in the recirculation zone downstream the obstacle. The
flame–vortex interaction induced the transition to the mushroom flame,
and then to the twisted flame. At larger BR, the authors reported
that the higher flame velocity and the pressure gradients favored the
development of KH and RT instabilities, which participate to the defor-
mation of the flame front at different stages of the propagation. In their
study on the effect of irregular obstacle patterns, characterized with an
obstacle irregularity index, Brunoro Ahumada et al. [543] found that
increasing BR between two obstacles tends to promote short DDT run-
up distance, while decreasing BR tends to delay DDT and led to longer
run-up distance. They attributed the promoting effect of increasing
BR to the occurrence of a turbulent jet ignition behind the second
obstacle. Gaathaug et al. [542] considered a single pair of fence-like
obstacles and reported that a jet is formed between the two obstacles
and significantly increases the flame velocity, while detonation onset
was accomplished in the vicinity of the side wall. In their corresponding
2D simulations, detonation onset was achieved by a series of local
explosions taking place between the elongated flame and the wall,
significantly behind the flame tip.

A configuration that was widely employed in many early studies
on FA and DDT corresponds to the repeated orifice plates inserted into
cylindrical tubes [586]. For example, Veser et al. [568] investigate the
effect of BR in the range 0.3 to 0.75 for lean to stoichiometric hydrogen-
based mixtures. They reported that, regardless of the hydrogen content,
the run-up distance for FA to start decreases as BR is increased. The
corresponding 2D numerical simulations demonstrated the same trend.
It seems the repeated orifice plate configuration became less popular in
recent years. This might be due to the difficulty of visualizing the FA
and DDT processes in these facilities. Numerical simulations of such
a geometry is also challenging. In more recent papers, a very popular

configuration for studying FA and DDT corresponds to repeated fence-
like obstacles located only on one side of the channel/tube, either at
the bottom or at the top. Teodorczyk et al. [548] as well as Escofet-
Martin et al. [480] both observed a promoting effect on FA and DDT
of increasing BR up to approximately 0.5. However, they reported that
a too low or too high BR would prohibit detonation onset. Numerical
simulations by Ago et al. [569] essentially confirmed these results with
detonation onset observed for BR=0.3 and 0.45 but not for BR=0.16.
On the other hand, Maeda et al. [536] observed experimentally that for
the stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture, DDT takes place at a shorter distance
when using obstacles with small BR. This is shown in Fig. 78. They
attributed this unusual behavior to the high reactivity of the mixture.
This observation was later confirmed by Li et al. [537] using contin-
uous triangular obstacles. Interestingly, Obara et al. [535] proposed
an alternative option to characterize the channel obstruction extent.
Rather than BR, they indicated the volume occupied by the obstacle
with respect to the channel total volume. They found that the minimum
DDT distance was obtained for an obstacle volume of approximately
1.5%. For larger obstacle volumes, the DDT run-up distance increased
and reached a value approximately 60% higher as the obstacle volume
reaches about 7% of the total volume.

It is also noted that some studies employed arrays of round ob-
stacles, whose BR and arrangement were varied. Such configurations
typically include tens of obstacles. Kumar [546] performed a compre-
hensive parametric study of FA in a large-scale obstructed facility. The
blockage ratio was change from 0.1 to 0.3 and it was reported that
the increase of BR induced an increase of the maximum flame speed.
Li et al. [570] numerically studied the effect of BR on FA and DDT
in channels equipped with 2D arrays of round obstacles with either
an inline or a staggered arrangement. For a staggered configuration,
the authors reported a higher FA and faster DDT for BR=0.5 than
for BR=0.33. The slowest flame was observed for BR=0.67, and no
DDT could be achieved in this case. Higher blockage ratio also favored
higher amplitude of the oscillation of the wave velocity. The authors
pointed out that higher BR can promote FA due to the higher frequency
of collision of the flame with the obstacles and the entrainment of
the flame between the obstacles. On the other hand, a too high BR
can inhibit DDT by weakening shock focusing. Overall, these results
were consistent with the experimental observations by Pinos and Ci-
ccarelli [571] who employed similar configurations and reported that
BR was the dominant parameter under such conditions.

Spacing:
Using a vertical tube of large diameter, Kumar [546] studied the
effect of obstacle spacing on FA. The obstacle spacing was modified in
the range 0.275–1.1 m and it was found that increasing the spacing
led to a significant decrease of the flame speed. For example, for a H2
content of 20%, the maximum flame speed was reduced from 700 to
200 m/s as the spacing was increased from 0.275 to 1.1 m.

A number of studies have investigated the effect of obstacle spacing
in horizontal tube/channel equipped with different numbers of ob-
stacles. For a configuration with only 2 obstacles, Brunoro Ahumada
et al. [543] noted that rapid DDT induced by a turbulent jet ignition
behind the second obstacle could be achieved only for intermediate
or long distances between the obstacles. For the shortest distance,
DDT took place at the end of the tube after the leading shock wave
had interacted with the expansion section. Gamezo et al. [519] and
Rudy and Teodorczyk [572] numerically studied the effect of fence-like
obstacle spacing on the FA and DDT. Small obstacle spacing promoted
FA due to the faster increase of flame surface area. On the other hand,
larger obstacle spacing promoted DDT, which was attributed to the
ability of the curved shocks, formed by diffraction around the obstacles,
to evolve from regular to Mach reflection as they interact with the
side walls; a longer spacing enabled the stronger Mach stem to reflect
against the next obstacle and initiate detonation in the bottom corner.
If transition to Mach reflection was not achieved because of a too short
spacing, detonation was initiated by reflection of the leading shock

at the top corner of an obstacle. For such an event to take place, a
much stronger shock was required, which was produced by strong FA
induced through local explosions in pockets of unburnt gas located far
downstream of the leading shock. Fig. 79 shows flame propagating in
obstructed channels with different configurations, including different
spacing. In fact, Obara et al. [535] determined experimentally that
an optimum spacing (S) to obstacle height (H) ratio exists to ensure
a short DDT distance. For S/H=4, the DDT distance was minimum,
whereas for S/H=0.5, the increase in normalized run-up distance was
increased by approximately 60%. On the other hand, Maeda et al. [536]
reported that for highly reactive mixtures, larger obstacle spacing could
lead to shorter DDT run-up distance for small BR=0.05–0.1, than for
larger BR=0.15. For such a configuration, large pockets of unreacted
gas can be formed between the obstacles and their delayed explosion
would contribute to detonation onset.

For completeness, we recall the mechanism proposed by Bychkov
et al. [528] which provides very strong FA in the particular case of a
channel obstructed by thin and tightly spaced obstacles. In this case,
the very small distance between obstacles enables the delayed burning
of the mixture between the obstacles to create a strong jetflow, which
sustains flame acceleration.

Layout:

In their comprehensive numerical study of the effect of obstacle
spacing, Gamezo et al. [519] also considered symmetrical and stag-
gered configurations. Depending on the obstacle spacing, staggered
obstacles could either promote or inhibit DDT. For large enough spac-
ing, the authors pointed out that, because the leading shock was weaker
when staggered obstacles were used, detonation initiation was taking
place behind Mach stem formed by a secondary shock. Typical simula-
tion results obtained by Gamezo et al. [519] are shown in Fig. 79. Wang
et al. [573] extended the work of Gamezo et al. [519] by considering
four configurations: (1) the canonical configuration with symmetric
bottom and top obstacles; (2) non-symmetric bottom and top obstacles;
(3) obstacles only on the top wall; and (4) staggered obstacles, similar
to Gamezo et al. study. In addition, they also studied the effect of
having two fence-like obstacles of different lengths at the bottom and
top walls. During the FA phase, the obstacle arrangement influenced
the flame wrinkling and the formation of unburnt pockets of gas
around the obstacles, which led to different DDT run-up distances and
times; in decreasing order of efficiency at creating DDT, they reported
configurations 1, 2, 4, and 3. They distinguished two detonation onset
mechanisms; for cases 1, 2, and 4, it was attributed to hot spot ignition
in the vicinity of the flame front, while for case 3, it was attributed to
the formation of a high-pressure region in front of the flame by multiple
compression waves.

Ogawa et al. [574], Li et al. [570] and Pinos and Ciccarelli [571]
studied FA and DDT in channels filled with a bank of inline or staggered
round obstacles. Ogawa et al. [574] observed three main stages: (1)
flame acceleration due to flame surface area increase as the flow
interacts with the obstacles; (2) flame acceleration due to shock–flame
interaction; 3) potential DDT and formation of a quasi-detonation.
During the first stage, the most favorable configuration is the inline
one because the flow between the obstacle is faster due to a minimum
obstruction. On the other hand, during the second stage, faster FA is
achieved in the staggered configurations, which favors shock–flame in-
teraction. DDT actually does not occur for the inline configuration and
only a chocked flame is formed. Li et al. [570] employed similar con-
figurations as the ones used by Ogawa et al. [574] but also considered
an inline-scattered arrangement; the inline configuration employed
by Ogawa et al. was then referred to as inline-concentrated. The
shortest DDT run-up distance was observed for the inline-concentrated
case, while the longest was observed for the inline-scattered case. The
shortest run-up distance and time to DDT were both obtained for the
staggered case. The authors attributed these differences in terms of
DDT onset time and distance to the propensity of each configuration
to create strong shock focusing. Pinos and Ciccarelli [571] employed
a variety of hydrogen–air mixtures with different equivalence ratios
and used configurations with BR = 0.5 and 0.67. Experimentally, the
maximum flame velocity was found not to be much affected by the
layout of the obstacles in the regime of fast flame and BR appeared as
a more important parameter. The obstacle layout turned out to be more
important in the quasi-detonation regime.

Ogawa et al. [575] performed a similar study using square obstacles.
Vertically, the obstacles were staggered and the ignition location was
the bottom left corner of the computational domain. This particular
configuration results in the fact that both unobstructed and obstructed
paths exist between the obstacles. Consistent with the results of [571,
574], the flame initially propagates faster in the less obstructed paths,
and then FA is stronger in the more obstructed paths because shock–
flame interaction became the dominant mechanism for increasing the
heat release rate. DDT took place simultaneously at several highly
congested locations.

5.2.4.2.2. Effect of obstacle shape In the past few years, a num-
ber of experimental and numerical studies have employed obstacles
with various shapes. In most studies [537,565], the obstacles are lo-
cated on the side walls. However, the effect of the obstacle shape was
also studied for obstacles placed in the middle of the channel [576]. The
obstacle shapes include rectangle, square, half-cylinder, half-cylinder
placed at an angle of ±90◦, and triangle. The presence of sharp edges
on the obstacles favored the formation of vortical structures and vortex
shedding in the fresh gas. These features were responsible for FA, and in

turn for the formation of shocks, which eventually induced DDT [565,
576]. Therefore, it was found that rectangular and square obstacles are
the most efficient at promoting FA and DDT, while half-cylinders are
the least efficient. This feature was observed for both obstacle at the
wall and obstacle in the middle of the channel [565,576]. In the case of
half-cylinder obstacles, the chord length to tube diameter ratio (C/D)
has a profound and complex impact on flame dynamics. For small and
intermediate C/D, tulip-like flames were formed, whereas for large
C/D, only finger-tip flames were observed. A very complex pressure
field is formed due to the complex interaction of the shocks with
the curved obstacles, which led to multiple and complex reflections
and diffractions of the shocks. At the optimum C/D=0.5, short DDT
run-up distance and high combustion wave velocity are obtained. For
such obstacles, detonation onset was observed to take place in the
vicinity of the flame front, and close to the location of a pair of
obstacles. The experimental study of Li et al. [537] provides unusual
results. They employed a channel whose walls were equipped with
continuous triangular obstacles with BR in the range 0–0.7. The mixture
studied was stoichiometric H2-O2. The interaction of the flame with
the obstacles for different BR is shown in Fig. 80. Interestingly, the
shorter DDT run-up distance was observed for BR=0.1, despite a slower
flame acceleration during the early stage than for BR=0.3, 0.5, and 0.7.
While for BR=0.3 and 0.5, the flame propagation reached the choking
regime (around 1200 m/s) before DDT occurred, for BR=0.1, the flame
accelerated only to 740 m/s before DDT took place. The shorter DDT
run-up distance for BR=0.1 was attributed to the combined effects of
shock compression and viscous heating in the boundary layer.

For completeness, it is also noted that Golovastov et al. [577]
studied the effect on the DDT run-up distance for H2-air mixtures by
inserting a twisted ribbon inside a semi-closed detonation tube with
inner diameter of 20 mm. The ribbons had a length of 400 mm, a
width of 20 mm, and a pitch of 100 or 200 mm. The impact of a
flat plate was also studied. For stoichiometric mixture, the reduction of
the run-up distance was limited to 13%–17% when the plate or ribbon
were inserted in the tube. For a lean (Φ = 0.7) and a rich (Φ = 1.5)
mixture, the run-up distance was reduced by 40%–43% for the ribbon
with a 100 mm pitch, and became comparable to the run-up distance
measured for Φ = 1. For the stoichiometric mixture, the ribbon with a
pitch of 100 mm was less effective than the ribbon with a 200 mm
pitch, while for the lean and rich mixtures, the opposite trend was
observed.

5.2.4.2.3. Effect of obstacle flexibility Li et al. [578,579] com-
pared the FA process in a channel equipped with rigid and flexible
obstacles. These studies were motivated by the fact that in real indus-
trial settings, some obstacles can present some degrees of flexibility.
In [578], the authors employed a 1 m long 70 × 70 mm2 square channel

obstructed by a single obstacle with height of 50 mm, providing a
BR of 0.71. The flexible obstacle was made of polyurethane sponge.
Representative schlieren images obtained with rigid and flexible ob-
stacles are shown in Fig. 81. The authors pointed out the very clear
formation of a large vortex downstream of the flexible obstacle but
attributed this feature mainly to the higher roughness of the obstacle
surface. The deformation of the flexible obstacle modified the BR,
which in turn modified the flame propagation. For a stoichiometric and
a rich (Φ = 4) mixture, the flame acceleration was delayed when the
flexible obstacle was employed. For a lean (Φ = 0.6) mixture, FA was
rather promoted by the flexible obstacle. It was also mentioned that
the flexible obstacles modify the frequency and amplitude of acoustic
waves generated during the FA process. In [579], series of 3 rigid and
flexible obstacles were employed and the BR was decreased to 0.43.
The authors pointed out that for the flexible obstacles, the BR is in
fact time-dependent, which can affect the flame propagation and lead
to locally faster or slower flame than when rigid obstacles are used.
For rich mixtures (Φ = 2 and 3), FA was much less effective for the
flexible obstacle configuration, and lower flame speeds were achieved.
In addition, flexible obstacles tend to decrease the over-pressure during
FA, especially when Φ is equal or larger than 0.8.
5.2.4.2.4. Effect of channel/tube dimensions

It has been demon-
strated that the dimensions of the facility can have a very significant
impact on the DDT domain [173,580]. The most relevant example of
such an effect corresponds to the study of Dorofeev et al. [173] who
performed FA and DDT experiments in a very large scale facility with
a total volume of up to 480 m3, referred to as RUT facility. Under such
confinement conditions, detonation onset was possible at a hydrogen
concentration as low as 12.5% in air, whereas previous experiments
performed in smaller facilities reported a detonation limit at 15%
H2. In a subsequent study, Dorofeev et al. [581] further investigated
the effect of scale on detonation onset by considering a large set of
experimental data for a variety of hydrogen-based mixtures at different
initial conditions, and for different BR, scales, and geometries. By

providing a stricter definition of the characteristic length-scale (L) of
the facility, they further confirmed the applicability of the L > 7λ
criterion to determine the necessary conditions for DDT to take place in
a given facility and for a given mixture. This agreement is illustrated
in Fig. 82. It should be noted however, that defining L for complex
geometries, such as those encountered in industrial settings, remains
a challenging task [550]. The effect of scale was also pointed out by
Kudriakov et al. [552] when comparing the results of experiments
focusing on the effect of concentration gradients on FA.

Despite the many challenges that arise when performing large-
scale, 3D simulations, several studies [560,582,583] have focused on
simulating the experiments of Dorofeev et al. [173]. In general, these
large-scale simulations could capture the main qualitative features ob-
served experimentally, and even provide quantitatively correct results.
In particular, the results of Hasslberger et al. [560] essentially con-
firmed that detonation can be initiated at very low hydrogen content;
for the same specific configuration of the obstacles, the limit was 13.5%
in the simulation against 12.5% in the experiment. Nevertheless, the
authors pointed out that their approach only enabled to capture deto-
nation onset through reflected-shock initiation, while onset at the flame
brush could not be reproduced. These modeling efforts were further
extended to the simulation of FA and DDT in a full-scale pressurized
water nuclear reactor. Hasslberger et al. [550] considered a Konvoi-
type reactor building and studied the impact of various parameters such
as the hydrogen concentration, 15 or 17.5% H2 in air, ignition location,
bottom or top of the building, presence or absence of a concentration
gradient, initial temperature, 293 or 373 K, and initial pressure, 101
and 250 kPa. In all but one case, FA and DDT were observed to take
place. The strength of FA and exact location of DDT was found to vary
significantly with the various parameters tested. DDT was not observed
only for the case when a homogeneous concentration of 15% H2 in air
at 293 K and 101 kPa was considered.

On the other hand, small gap may prevent FA and DDT to take place.
Kuznetsov and Grune [511] studied FA and DDT in narrow layers.

They employed a 90 cm long rectangular channel with cross-section of
200 × 1–10 mm2. Mixtures with 4%–30% of hydrogen in air at ambient
conditions were used. For a stoichiometric mixture, detonation could be
successfully initiated for gaps of 6 and 8 mm when rough metal plates
were inserted in the channel. Under similar conditions but for a gap of
2 mm, only chocked flame propagation could be achieved.

5.2.4.3. Effect of channel/tube partial opening. Alekseev et al. [584] ex-
perimentally studied the effect of partial opening. They employed tubes
with inner diameters (D) of 46 and 92 mm with normalized length of
63 D and BR = 0.6. The lateral venting area was α = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 the
total area of the cylinder. Experiments were performed for hydrogen–
air mixtures with 9%–70% H2 and hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen mixtures
with 11%–40% H2. The critical expansion ratio for flame acceleration
to take place was increased by 2.24α. In vented tube, fast flame would
propagate at a velocity close to the sound speed in the reactants. On the
other hand, not much impact was observed for the critical conditions
for DDT to occur, and the velocity of quasi-detonation was not affected
as compared to a closed tube.

5.2.4.4. Effect of external energy addition. Gray and Lacoste [585]
employed nano-second pulsed plasma discharges with frequency of
100 kHz and energy of 10 mJ per pulse. The electrode assembly was
installed 100 cm downstream of a single orifice plate used to accelerate
the flame initiated with a weak electric spark. For a stoichiometric
hydrogen–air mixture, very high probability of DDT could be achieved
when the energy of the discharges and the positions of the electrodes
were optimized.

5.2.4.5. Effect of boundary conditions. Coates et al. [565] reported that
DDT in a channel obstructed by fence-like obstacles was promoted by
no-slip boundary conditions. As for the effect of adiabatic or isothermal
wall conditions, Xiao and Oran [576] found that for a large BR=0.67,
FA is much limited and DDT does not occur if isothermal walls are
employed, whereas for BR=0.5, Li et al. [570] reported that isother-
mal wall enabled better agreement with experiments by Pinos and
Ciccarelli [571], although no qualitative differences could be observed.

5.3. FA and DDT in semi-confined and unconfined environments

Only a limited number of studies were performed on the flame and
detonation dynamics in semi- and unconfined environments. We suc-
cessively summarize the studies focusing on the FA and DDT processes

in semi-confined and in confined environments. Finally, we present the
few studies focusing on the mechanism of detonation onset.

5.3.1. FA and DDT in semi-confined environments

A number of studies were performed on the FA and DDT processes
in horizontal [587–589] semi-confined layers. Flame acceleration and
DDT in a horizontal gas layer is shown in Fig. 83. Grune et al. [587,
588] and Kuznetsov et al. [589] studied the critical conditions for FA
and DDT to take place in a semi-confined horizontal layer containing
either homogeneous or stratified H2-O2-N2 mixtures. Depending on
the reactivity of the mixture, slow flame, sonic flame, and quasi-
detonation were observed. Nevertheless, fast flame could not be formed
in unobstructed channel for both mixtures with and without concen-
tration gradient. In homogeneous mixtures, quasi-detonation could be
obtained only if a nitrogen concentration lower that in air was used.
Grune et al. [587,588] found a linear correlation between the critical
expansion ratio for FA to take place and the inverse of the effective
layer height for both mixtures with and without concentration gradient.
In other studies [590,591], vertical configurations were employed.
Friedrich et al. [590] employed a 6 m in height vertical square channel.
The channel is opened on one side and equipped with repeated obsta-
cles with BR = 0.5. As in horizontal semi-confined layers, slow flame,
sonic flame, and quasi-detonation were observed depending on the con-
ditions. The critical expansion ratio for FA to take place was found to
follow σc = 4.5, where σ was calculated for the average concentration.
Concerning DDT onset, the critical conditions were well represented by
h∕λ > 13.5, where h is the height of the reactive layer, and λ was esti-
mated for the maximum H2 content. Golub et al. [591] experimentally
studied flame propagation in hydrogen–air mixtures (12%–30% H2)
contained in a 4.5 m3 cylindrical polyethylene envelope. They divided
the flame propagation into three stages: (i) hemispherical propagation;
(ii) transition stage; (iii) propagation along the cylindrical envelope.
The authors found acceleration exponents of 1.05–1.2 and 2.95–3.1,
respectively during stages (i) and (iii). In both cases, the exponent tends
to increase with hydrogen content. The results were interpreted based
on Kolmogorov theory.

Grune et al. [592] studied the self-acceleration of cylindrical flames
in semi-confined layers with widths of 6 to 250 mm. For gaps in the
range 6–100 mm, the flame speed in lean mixtures with up to 20%
H2 was 1.8 to 2.4 times larger than the laminar flame speed. For
richer mixtures, the observed flame speed was only 1.2 to 1.9 times
the laminar flame speed.

5.3.2. FA and DDT in unconfined environments

Thomas et al. [593] discussed the potential for explosion of un-
confined hydrogen vapor clouds. They emphasized the incorrectness of
the general idea that large hydrogen vapor clouds cannot be formed
because hydrogen would quickly ignite after release and/or the vapor
cloud would float away due to buoyancy. From the examination of
previous accidents involving accidental hydrogen release, they con-
cluded that, in some cases, the damages induced by hydrogen vapor
cloud explosion were compatible with the occurrence of a detonation.
The authors pointed out the important role of congestion in the de-
velopment of a detonation wave. The experimental results of Groethe
et al. [354] seems somehow consistent with the analysis of Thomas
et al. [593]. They performed a series of large-scale explosion tests using
various configurations. In one of them, they employed a stoichiometric
hydrogen–air mixture contained in a 300 m3 dome. They could initiate
a CJ detonation when using 10 g of C-4 high-explosive as the initiation
source. However, it remains unclear what is the mechanism responsible
for detonation onset, i.e., direct detonation initiation or FA followed by
DDT. On the other hand, the numerical results of Heidari et al. [583]
tend to indicate that detonation initiation in a large vapor cloud is
possible without congestion. They performed numerical simulations on
a domain of 11,200 m2 with unconfined vapor clouds of different aspect
ratios. A detonation could be initiated in the reactive H2-air cloud by
a small high-pressure and high-temperature region, and consumed all
the reactive gas. As the detonation exited the reactive cloud, the shock
wave diffracted at the top, and got quickly attenuated.

Hytovick et al. [594] studied the combustion regime resulting from
the interaction of a turbulent flame–shock complex with a soap bubble
containing a hydrogen–oxygen mixture. The flame–shock complex was
formed in a semi-open shock tube. They varied the equivalence ratio
of the mixture in the bubble. The regime of combustion appeared to be
highly sensitive to the equivalence ratio of the mixture in the bubble; as
Φ was increased from approximately 0.86 to 1.06, sonic flame, super-
sonic flame, quasi-detonation, and CJ detonation were observed. The
authors observed intense turbulent mixing as the flame–shock complex
interacted with the gas in the bubble. This mixing eventually led to the
initiation of a detonation. Detonation initiation was also observed for
rich mixtures with Φ = 1.16 and 1.23. In these cases, detonation was
initiated in the shock tube, decoupled after exiting the tube, and then
re-initiated upon interaction with the bubble.

A number of experimental studies were performed using plastic
tent [343,595,596] or the soap bubble technique [597] to study the

self-acceleration of spherically expanding flames in hydrogen-based
mixtures under unconfined conditions, see examples in Fig. 84. For
lean mixtures, flame acceleration was mainly attributed to flame sur-
face area increase induced by thermo-diffusive instabilities. For rich
mixtures, and when using a soap bubble, it was found that the mixing
induced at the bubble burst could significantly accelerate the flame
propagation. For all mixtures, especially as pressure was increased,
hydro-dynamic instability also contributes to flame acceleration. In
some studies, the authors indicated that self-similar flame propaga-
tion could possibly be achieved [343], while in others, the authors
could not draw a definitive conclusion [596]. The authors attempted
to determine the acceleration exponent (α), and fractal dimension of
the flames. For hydrogen–air mixtures, the exponent values ranged
between 1.05 and 1.55 depending on the equivalence ratio and con-
sidering the complete flame propagation. The exponent values were
found to be the largest for the leanest mixtures. For large enough
flame radii, the exponent tends to plateau around 1.3–1.4, which
seems consistent with experimental values obtained at high pressure
in a constant-pressure combustion chamber [598]. On the other hand,
Xin et al. [599] obtained a higher value of 1.564, after correcting
for 3D geometry the value obtained from high-resolution 2D numer-
ical simulations performed with detailed chemistry. For H2-O2-N2-Ar
mixtures, the exponent was found to continuously increases as the
flame developed, to reach a maximum value around 1.2 for a near-
stoichiometric mixture. The leanest mixture demonstrated the lowest
exponent. For hydrogen–air mixtures, the fractal dimension was found
to be in the range 2.2–2.35, depending on the studies and conditions.
In all experimental studies, higher flame velocity and acceleration led
to higher over-pressure. Bauwens et al. [345] performed a similar study
in a 64 m3 constant-pressure enclosure for hydrogen–air mixtures with
Φ = 0.33–0.57, and reported a value of α = 1.32. It is noted that
Grune et al. [592] also studied the self-acceleration of spherical flame
under unconfined conditions but did not provided flame acceleration
exponent. Jiang et al. [600] also performed a similar study but applied
external turbulence whose intensity was determined using stereo-PIV.
The residual mean square velocity in the fresh gas ranged from 0 to
0.6848 m/s. Under such conditions, the turbulent flame was in the
flamelet regime. They reported that the flame speed was approximately
15% higher when motion was induced in the fresh mixture. It was
also mentioned that maximum over-pressure, maximum pressure rise
rate, and maximum impulse were all significantly increased by the
initial turbulence. No detonation onset was reported in any of these

is undergoing isotropic turbulent fluctuations. They also developed a
turbulent version of the theoretical model of Gu et al. [467] to deter-
mine the critical conditions for detonation ignition by turbulent hot
spot. The turbulent version of the ratio of the hot spot size to the speed
of sound multiplied by the excitation time, provided a good estimate of
the detonability under turbulent conditions. For simulations performed
with values of this ratio above/below 1, strong/no acoustic–thermal
coupling took place which led to/prevented detonation onset.

5.4. Summary on FA and DDT studies

The study of FA and DDT has been a popular topic over the past
15 years and close to 200 papers have been examined during the
preparation of this review. Many of these studies are rather incremental
or repeated work. In general, there is a lack of quantitative information
concerning the state of the flow field during the FA and DDT processes,
which favors a subjective interpretation of the results. Many of the
investigations are essentially descriptive and the wording employed to
characterize the different phases of the process, especially detonation
onset, is not necessarily rigorous nor consistent between different pa-
pers. While few interesting numerical studies have been performed on
this topic, the possibility of DDT occurrence in a fully unconfined and
un-obstructed environment remains unclear. Despite such limitations,
a number of improvements and progresses in the characterization and
general understanding of FA and DDT have been possible and some
highlights are emphasized below.

Mainly motivated by nuclear plant safety, the effects of concentra-
tion gradients on the FA and DDT processes have been extensively in-
vestigated [485–490,490,518,550–558,560,587–590]. In smooth tube,
it was found that the DDT run-up distance is shorter and shorter as
the steepness of the transverse gradient is increased. Concerning FA
and DDT in obstructed channel, the concentration gradients decrease
and increase the run-up distance, respectively for lean and rich average
concentrations. In general, experimental studies performed for semi-
confined environment as well as numerical simulations have confirmed
such observations. These new results are important to better assess the
risk of FA and DDT in both obstructed and un-obstructed settings. In
particular, it was shown that some of the correlations used for risk
assessment that were developed using data obtained in homogeneous
mixtures are not fully applicable to inhomogeneous mixtures [553].

Another important novelty achieved in the recent years corresponds
to the implementation of improved imaging techniques for the study
of FA and DDT. For instance, two-direction and stereoscopic imaging
diagnostics were respectively employed by Ballossier et al. [441,461]
and Krivosheyev et al. [464] to determine the flame morphology during
FA as well as the precise location of DDT onset. These two approaches
provided much insights into the FA and DDT processes and enabled
to better understand the flame evolution during FA, and the dominant
role of the boundary layer and near-wall processes in the occurrence
of DDT event. Such approaches should be generalized in future studies

simulations were performed with a reaction–diffusion model representing a stoichio-

studies. The critical conditions for an unconfined expanding flame to
accelerate and transit to a detonation were investigated numerically
by Koksharov et al. [601]. The model employed was 1D, considered
detailed chemistry, and the Σ2-model was used to take into account
the increase of the flame surface area due to flame wrinkling induced
by flame instabilities. A critical flame radius of 11 m was found for the
onset of detonation, which is significantly smaller than the radius of
the precursor shock at that time, around 13 m. The authors noted that
the flame speed does not reach the CJ deflagration velocity before DDT
is taking place.

5.3.3. Detonation onset in unconfined environments

Poludnenko et al. [602] numerically studied the transition of turbu-
lent flame to detonation in unconfined environment. They performed
3D numerical simulations of turbulent flame propagation in the thin
reaction and the broken reaction regions. For high enough turbulence
intensity, the premixed turbulent flames are intrinsically unstable to
DDT. They identified a feedback loop between the turbulent flame and
pressure growth, that led to detonation onset. Under such conditions,
i.e., at temperature below 700 K, the characteristic time-scale for
auto-ignition is much too long and the runaway was driven by flame
propagation. Fig. 85 shows the characteristics of the FA and DDT
processes under such conditions.

Although performed in a constant volume, it is worth mentioning
the study of Towery et al. [603] who numerically and theoretically
investigated the effect of thermodynamic fluctuations on detonability
in a turbulent environment. They performed 3D numerical simulations
with detailed chemistry considering a cubic domain, in which the fluid

and coupled to quantitative diagnostics to characterize the flow field
during FA and DDT.

A number of experimental or numerical configurations, implement-
ing a very large variety of obstacle BR, spacings, and shapes, have been
employed to investigate FA and DDT [480,519,524,535,536,536,537,
542,543,548,565,567–576,578,579,604,605]. These parameters play a
dominant role in the FA and DDT processes and, depending on the
specific configuration, and on the characteristics of the mixture, may
have a promoting or a mitigating effect on either FA or DDT, or on
both phenomena. Importantly, Maeda et al. [536] and Li et al. [537]
reported that for very reactive mixtures, DDT could be promoted by
low BR. In general, the large variety of parameters that influence FA
and DDT in confined and obstructed environments makes it difficult to
determine if a specific configuration could rather promote or mitigate
the risk of FA and DDT. The approach proposed by Brunoro Ahumada
et al. [543] to quantify the irregularity of the obstacle patterns using
a well defined index is promising and should be further extended to
better characterize the potential for FA and DDT of specific obstacle
configurations. Interestingly, Li et al. [578,579] studied the effect of the
obstacle flexibility on the FA process. Because in real accidental events,
a large range of obstacle types could be present, including flexible ones,
this aspect should be further investigated and extended to conditions
under which DDT could take place.

Within the past 15 years, the increased computational power and
improved numerical approaches have enabled, on the one hand, to
perform very large-scale simulations, and, on the other hand, to gener-
alize the use of detailed chemistry in high-resolution simulation of FA
and DDT processes. Concerning very large-scale numerical simulations,
the impressive 3D results on FA and DDT in the RUT facility and in
a Konvoi-type reactor building by Hasslberger et al. [550,560] stand
out and provide much insights into accidental combustion events in
large-scale settings. The use of detailed chemistry has essentially led to
call into question the previous results obtained with 1-step chemistry,
especially in the case of FA and DDT simulations in smooth channel. Be-
cause 1-step models are typically calibrated based on high-temperature
ignition delay-time and cannot reproduce the change of activation re-
lated to the extended second explosion limit of hydrogen–air mixtures,
they predict significantly too fast ignition at low temperature. Liberman
et al. [449,469] further argued that, in previous numerical studies re-
lying on 1-step chemistry, detonation onset by the gradient mechanism
of Zeldovich was artificially taking place due to this over-predicted
reactivity. To explain detonation onset in the pre-heat zone behind
the relatively weak shock created during FA in a smooth tube, they
proposed a different mechanism which relies on the amplification of a
pressure pulse at the flame front. Although this new mechanism seems
mostly relevant for DDT in smooth tube, it has also been identified in
obstructed channel [533], and further study is required to clarify its
overall significance.

6. Detonation

The occurrence of a detonation constitutes the most extreme acci-
dental combustion event. Because a large amount of energy is typically
required to initiate directly a detonation, the most likely mechanism
leading to detonation onset corresponds to the DDT process. Neverthe-
less, the knowledge of the characteristics of detonation are still very
relevant for safety assessment. For instance, the critical conditions for
DDT to take place are often characterized using the detonation cell
width [173]. In case of accidental ignition of a fuel vapor cloud in
a partially congested area, some authors [61] claimed that all the
volume within the detonability limits will be consumed according to
the detonation mode, while other authors [437] have argued that non-
uniform mixture composition in the vapor cloud would significantly
restrict the volume of detonable mixture. In any case, it is important to
understand the conditions for detonation to propagate, especially under
near-limit conditions. As a consequence, the main characteristics and

features of detonation phenomena are given in this section. Relevant
studies on detonation propagation, near-limit detonation, direct deto-
nation initiation, detonation diffraction, and non-ideal detonation are
successively reviewed. It is noted that detonation suppression strategies
are not reviewed and the interested reader is invited to consult the
recent review on this topic by Wang et al. [606]. Similarly, the studies
on the characteristics of detonation engines, including oblique, pulsed,
and rotating detonation engines, are mentioned only when particularly
relevant to safety aspects. Several comprehensive reviews on detona-
tion engine are already available in the literature, see for example [607,
608]. Studies focusing on detonation under internal combustion engine
relevant conditions [609,610], frequently referred to as super-knock,
are not mentioned, nor are those on detonation stabilized by high-speed
projectile [611].

6.1. Detonation propagation

Unlike predicted by the Chapman–Jouguet and the Zeldovich–von
Neumann–Doering (ZND) theories, detonations are not planar, one-
dimensional, and steady, but intrinsically three-dimensional and un-
steady. Spatially, the detonation front exhibits a succession of convex
and planar sections/parts. Temporally, the detonation front continu-
ously oscillates around a ‘‘mean’’ position [612]. Detonations exhibit
a so-called cellular structure which has been widely employed to char-
acterize the sensitivity of different mixtures to detonate. The cellular
structure results from the intrinsically unstable coupling between the
shock front and the reaction zone and plays an important role in the
propagation mechanism of detonation [613].

6.1.1. Structure and stability

Although the existence of the cellular structure of detonation wave
was first demonstrated by Denisov and Troshin [614] using the soot foil
technique, the first direct visualization of a multi-headed detonation
was performed by White [615] using interferometry. The detonation
front is composed of alternating incident shocks and Mach stems,
which, along with the reflected shocks, intersect at the triple points
and form Mach reflection structures. For multi-headed detonation, two
families of triple points exist and propagate in opposite directions,
i.e., upward and downward. Triple points periodically collide, which
sustains the detonation propagation. The trajectories of the triple points
describe a diamond-shape pattern between two collisions, which is
referred to as cellular structure. Within a detonation cell, important
variations of the shock velocity, of the thermodynamic state behind
it, and of the induction zone length have been evidenced [612]. The
shock front structure fully controls the shape of the reaction zone which
demonstrates pronounced keystone features as a result of the difference
of shock strength between the incident shock and the Mach stem, and
of the presence of the slip line separating the flows behind the reflected
shock and the Mach stem. While the keystone feature could be deduced
from early shock polar and simple ignition delay-time calculations,
see Fig. 4 (d) in Fickett and Davis [616], the pioneering visualization
studies using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH radical at
the Technical University of Munich [617], and Caltech [618–621] were
instrumental in improving the understanding and description of the
detonation structure. The regularity of the structure of detonation prop-
agating in hydrogen–oxygen–diluent mixtures is strongly influenced by
the nature and quantity of the diluent employed [20]. For hydrogen–
oxygen mixtures highly diluted by argon, the leading shock front is
very regular and appears as a sharp line with a smooth contour. The
reaction zone is smooth and continuous and the keystone features are
very well defined. This is illustrated in Fig. 86(a). For hydrogen–oxygen
mixtures diluted by nitrogen, the leading shock front demonstrates
more important spatial variations. The reaction zone is more rugged
and wrinkled, and the keystone features are less pronounced, as seen
in Fig. 86(d).

Despite the deep insight provided by the OH-PLIF technique, it
has been shown [622–624] that in most cases, these images are only
partially representative of the actual detonation structure. This is due
to the strong absorption of the incident laser light at the detonation
front. Following the first few mm after the beginning of the reaction
zone, the remaining laser light is too weak to provide a LIF signal
representative of the local OH radical concentration. This limitation is
clearly visible when comparing Fig. 86 (b) to (c) and (e) to (f). In other
words, the detonation front is an optically thick object if employing a
strong absorption feature in the linear LIF regime [625], regardless of
the orientation of the incident laser light [626]. Recently, Rojas Chavez
et al. [627] examined the impact of the excitation scheme on OH-PLIF
imaging of detonation in a stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture. They
demonstrated that using saturated LIF or linear LIF in the optically
thin regime [625], enables to visualize the OH radical field away
from the detonation front. Grib et al. [628] employed a two-color LIF
approach to measure the temperature field of detonation propagating in
hydrogen-based mixtures. Their measurements were however limited to
the determination of the CJ temperature. A promising novel approach
was demonstrated by Rojas-Chavez et al. [629,630] and consists in
seeding the reactive mixture with few thousands ppm of NO and per-
form one- or two-dimensional NO-LIF. Since NO is present in the fresh
mixture, in the induction zone and in the reaction zone, the position
of the leading shock front and of the reaction zone can be clearly
identified, see Fig. 87. For completeness, it is noted that another laser-
based technique was employed to visualize detonation waves; Anderson
and Dabora [631] implemented planar Rayleigh scattering imaging and
coupled it to a schlieren system. They were able to visualize the density
field and measure the density jump across the different portions of
the leading shock front. They found that the maximum Rayleigh signal
intensity is located at the triple points which appear as extended circles
of high intensity. Rayleigh imaging was further studied numerically
by Bechon et al. [632] who showed that the density field structure
observed by Anderson and Dabora can be qualitatively reproduce only
if the limitation of the imaging system and of the post-processing,
i.e., camera resolution, dynamic range, spatial averaging, are taken into
account.

Characterizing the instability of the detonation is an important
aspect because it is usually observed that the detonation behavior is
different for highly regular and highly irregular mixtures. Depending on

the stability level, some correlations or simple theoretical models can
be employed or not to predict the detonation behavior under various
situations [633]. More details about these aspects are provided in the
following sections. There are usually three approaches to characterize
the instability of the mixture. The first one is based on the visual
observation of the cellular structure [634]. The structure would be
classified as having an excellent, a good, or a low regularity, or simply
as being irregular. This classification is somehow subjective and it has
been preferred to use more quantitative approaches in more recent
studies. These two other approaches are quite similar to each other and
are based on the determination of the some parameters which char-
acterize the mixture stability, the reduced activation energy (θ) [264]
and the χ stability parameter [635,636]. For a given mixture at given
initial conditions, the larger the distance between the neutral stability
curve and the calculated value of θ or χ, the higher the instability of
the detonation. For a stoichiometric hydrogen–oxygen mixture initially
at 20 kPa and 298 K, θ = 5.28 and χ = 2.25, which correspond to
typical values for a rather regular detonation. Although these values,
along with the stability level, change with various parameters (initial
pressure, dilution, diluent, equivalence ratio), detonation in hydrogen–
air mixtures are generally only moderately irregular, except under very

expected.

6.1.2. Experimental cell width data

The detonation cell width, i.e., the distance between two consecu-
tive triple points propagating in the same direction, characterizes the
sensitivity of reactive mixture to detonation and has been measured
extensively using the soot/smoked foil technique. A wide variety of
hydrogen-based mixtures have been employed, including undiluted
H2-O2 [637–641], H2-O2-diluent(s) [611,631,642], H2-air [643–647],
and H2-air-steam/CO2 [644,648]. The effect of ignition inhibitor [649,
650] and ignition promotors [650] addition has also been studied.
Experimental data obtained up to approximately 2000 are included
in the Detonation Database [21]. Since then, a number of additional
studies, for example by Mével et al. [73], Chen et al. [651], and
Crane et al. [650], have been performed and report complementary cell
width data. Fig. 88 shows examples of soot foils obtained for different
mixtures.

Table 8 presents selected detonation cell width for hydrogen–air
mixtures with various equivalence ratio [643,644,647]. Even for mod-
erately unstable detonation in a stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture
at near-ambient conditions, a difference larger than 30% can be ob-
served between the values reported in different studies. For near-
stoichiometric mixtures and ambient conditions, hydrogen–air mixtures
are very sensitive to detonation with a cell width on the order of 10–
15 mm. The cell width rapidly increases for off-stoichiometric mixtures
and a U-shape curve is observed in a log–log plot of the cell width as a
function of Φ. The cell width decreases according to a power-law as the
initial pressure is increased, and increases exponentially as the dilution
level is increased. These are typical trends [586]. The cell width also
tends to decrease as the initial temperature is increased but only few
data points are available, which complicates the interpretation of this
trend. Zitoun et al. [639] have reported that the detonation cell width
is approximately twice smaller at 123 K than at 293 K.

While the cell width constitutes an important and useful scaling
parameter, the cell width data have to be interpreted with care. Under

most conditions, there is no unique cell width but rather a distribution
of widths. Such a feature is not always mentioned or is reported as an
uncertainty, which is not a correct physical interpretation. For irregular
cellular structure, the cell width measured manually can be impaired
by the subjective interpretation of the experimentalist. The soot foil for
hydrogen–air mixtures is usually not too irregular. Guirao et al. [643]
discussed the specific difficulties in interpreting these soot foils and
reported prominent substructures for mixtures containing more than
28% of H2. While mathematical methods have been proposed to un-
ambiguously measure the cell width [652], these are not very widely
employed, possibly because they are difficult to apply to irregular
soot foil due to a high level of noise. Another important aspect for
interpreting the cell width data corresponds to the detonation velocity,
which is often not reported. Given, the exponential dependence of the
reaction rate on temperature, slightly faster or slower detonation wave
can produce significantly different cell width [653]. It is noted that the
3D interpretation of the cellular structure is significantly more compli-
cated, even for mixture with a regular structure, and confinement has
a very significant impact on the structure and dynamics of detonation.
Further details can be found in the studies of Monnier et al. [654,655].

6.1.3. Cell width prediction

Many theoretical and empirical models have been proposed to
predict the cell width. Given the very large number of models avail-
able, a complete review could not be performed and only represen-
tative examples are given. Interested readers can consult the review
of Vasiliev [656] on the dynamic detonation parameters, in which
different models that can be used to predict the detonation cell size are
discussed. In addition, a detailed discussion on the existing approaches
for cell width prediction is provided in Monnier et al. [655].

One of the earliest model for predicting the transverse wave spacing
has been proposed by Barthel [641] and is based on the study of
acoustic wave dynamics. Using ray tracking, it was shown that a single
hot spot is able to generate two hot spots located at a distance which is
related to the transverse wave spacing. Comparison of the predictions of
this model with measured detonation cell in hydrogen–oxygen mixtures
with and without argon dilution demonstrated satisfactory agreement.
Following the original idea of Schelkin and Troshin [657], according
to which the cell width is linearly proportional to the induction length,
some authors [658–660] have derived expressions to obtain the propor-
tionality factor (A) as a function of the initial composition and/or initial
thermodynamic conditions. Similar but more elaborated approaches
have been proposed by Gavrikov et al. [661] and Ng et al. [636].
These two models rely on the assumption that the proportionality
factor between the cell size and the induction zone length varies
with the detonation characteristics of each specific mixture, and in
particular, their stability. Gavrikov et al. expressed A as a function
of the effective activation energy and the ratio of the von Neumann
to initial temperature, while Ng et al. expressed A as a function of
a stability parameter (χ), which depends on the reduced activation
energy and the ratio of the induction to reaction zone lengths. Assuming
particular mathematical forms for the correlation equations, and using
a wide range of experimental data, the regression coefficients of the
correlations of Gavrikov and Ng were obtained by mathematical fitting.
A detailed description of the Cell Model is given in [656]. This
model is based on the concept of micro-explosion at the transverse wave
collision. A similar concept has been employed by Crane et al. [662]
to predict the cellular pattern for H2-O2 mixtures sensitized or not
by ozone. Recently, Monnier et al. [655] proposed a new model that
relies on the assumption that the burnt mass per unit of time is the
same in ZND and cellular detonations, and on graph theory to define
statistically a representative cellular pattern. The authors indicated that
their model is valid only for detonation whose driving mechanism is
ignition by adiabatic shock compression.

Some recent papers on detonation cell size prediction have em-
ployed the principles of machine learning. Yu et al. [663] employed
a supervised machine learning approach to obtain a non-parametric
model to predict the detonation cell width. Both 2-variate and 3-
variate support vector regression (SVR) were considered, where the
variates were the dimensionless activation energy, the dimensionless
temperature, and the dimensionless pressure. According to the authors,
the advantages of the SVR approach include: (i) no assumption on the
mathematical form of the model is made, (ii) better predictions are
achieved, (iii) higher stability, and (iv) a better adaptability. Both the
2- and 3-variate SVR models provide significantly better cell width
prediction than the model of Gavrikov et al. [661]. The most recent
study was performed by Malik et al. [664] and relied on the very
popular deep neural network approach to predict the detonation cell
width for several fuels, including hydrogen. The input parameters that
were retained were reactive mixture type, adiabatic flame temperature,
fuel fraction, and initial pressure in some cases; indicating that the
effective activation energy and the induction zone length were not
employed at all in the model, to avoid any influence from the chemical
kinetics mechanism. For hydrogen–air mixtures, cell width prediction
with a mean error below 15% was achieved.

Most of the models discussed above provide an average accuracy
of approximately a factor of two in the cell width prediction, see for

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

example Fig. 6.2 in [665]. It seems that recent models developed on the
principle of machine learning could provide better accuracy. In addi-
tion, it is noted that 2D numerical simulations performed with detailed
chemistry could also be employed to predict the cell size. Nevertheless,
as pointed out by Mevel et al. [623,666] and others [653,667], a
number of limitations may prevent accurate prediction of the cell width
using such an approach. These include: (i) experimental velocity deficit;
(ii) uncertainty of the reaction model; (iii) numerical mode-locking; (iv)
vibrational non-equilibrium impact; and (v) three-dimensional effects.

6.1.4. Propagation in mixtures with concentration gradient

Under actual accidental combustion conditions, it is very likely that
the composition of the mixture is not homogeneous and demonstrate
more or less important gradients of concentration. Such a situation
can significantly influence the detonation propagation and has been
investigated in a number of studies.

6.1.4.1. Experimental studies. Experimental studies have considered
two configurations for investigating the effect of concentration gradient
on detonation propagation.

In the first configuration, the gradient was parallel to the detonation
propagation direction. Such a situation has been studied by Kuznetsov
et al. [475] who investigated the transmission of a detonation from
a highly sensitive, stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture (driver) to a
less sensitive, lean hydrogen–air mixture (acceptor) through a con-
centration gradient. The gradient was formed by diffusion following
the opening of a sliding rubber membrane, while the strength of the
gradient was controlled by adjusting the detonation initiation time.
The dynamics of the detonation transmission process strongly depended
on the sharpness of the gradient. For weak gradient, a continuous
adaptation of the propagation velocity allowed the wave not to fail
before entering the less reactive mixture. On the contrary, for strong
gradient, shock and reaction zone decoupling was observed and re-
initiation in the acceptor mixture could take place or not depending
on the sensitivity of this mixture. The critical value of the gradient
separating these two behaviors appeared to be a strong function of the
difference of sensitivity between the driver and acceptor mixtures.

In the second configuration, the gradient was perpendicular to the
detonation propagation direction [668,669]. In [668], the transverse
gradients were formed by diffusion of oxygen or nitrogen through
a porous wall from a diffusion chamber to the detonation chamber
filled with a stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture. In [669], the transverse
gradients were formed by injecting hydrogen into air and controlling
the time of diffusion. Ishi et Kojima [668] reported that the propa-
gation velocity was not much affected when oxygen was allowed to
diffuse into the H2-O2 mixture. On the other hand, important velocity
deficit and larger run-up distances were measured when nitrogen was
employed as the diffusing species. For mixtures with nitrogen as the
diffusing species, the detonation front demonstrated significant tilting
and the cellular structure increased in size from the top to the bottom
wall. The cell at the bottom wall also appeared to be distorted and
exhibited a parallelogram shape rather than a diamond shape. The
tilted shape of the detonation front could be well explained by a ray
tracking approach. The study of Boeck et al. [669] provides additional
insights into the dynamics of detonation propagation in mixtures with
transverse concentration gradients. For mixtures with relatively shallow
concentration, a multi-headed detonation with important curvature was
observed. This strong curvature of the detonation front was attributed
to the vertical detonation speed gradient. For mixtures with a steeper
concentration gradient, a single-headed detonation exhibiting a large
Mach reflection structure was observed, see Fig. 89. The modification
of the overall structure has a strong effect on the pressure signal and
the soot foil. The pressure signal is non-symmetric between the top and
the bottom of the channel, with higher pressure at the bottom behind
the Mach stem of the dominant Mach reflection structure. Only a single
triple point track was observed, with an alternation of propagation

upward and downward. An overall trend that was observed by Boeck
et al. [669] corresponds to the increase of the detonation velocity
deficit as the steepness of the concentration gradient is increased. Up to
9% deficit compared to the CJ velocity were reported for the steepest
concentration gradients.

6.1.4.2. Theoretical and numerical studies. Vidal [670] performed a
theoretical analysis of the critical conditions for detonation existence
in mixtures with gradients of temperature and dilution in the direction
of detonation propagation. Large activation energy as well as small
variation of the initial conditions were assumed. Two limiting regimes
were identified: (i) the sub-critical regime, in which the detonation fails
due to the volumetric expansion behind the front; and (ii) the super-
critical regime, in which no decoupling/recoupling of the leading shock
and reaction zone were observed.

Configurations similar to the one studied experimentally by Boeck
et al. [669], i.e., with transverse gradients, were employed in several
two-dimensional numerical simulation studies
[671–673] performed
with detailed chemistry. Ettner et al. [671] and Han et al. [672] con-
sidered several linear variations of hydrogen and oxygen contents along
the channel height, whereas Song et al. [673] described the transverse
hydrogen concentration by sigmoid functions. Depending on the slope
of the gradient, they identified three modes of propagation: (i) curved
multi-head, for a shallow gradient; ii) single-head, for a steep gradient;
and (iii) alternating, for intermediate gradient. For shallow gradients,
only a slight distortion of the detonation front as well as locally larger
cell widths were observed. The presence of the concentration gradient
tends to induce an increase of the velocity deficit, of the cellular
irregularity, and of the formation of unreacted gas pockets behind the
detonation front. For steep gradients, only a single-headed detonation
could be established within the computational domain and a strong
transverse detonation was periodically formed. Such a wave consumes
the pre-conditioned gas behind the weak leading shock and limits the
velocity deficit in the vicinity of the detonability limit. The appearance
of Mach reflections of increasing strength leads to non-symmetric pres-
sure traces between the top and bottom walls with significantly larger
impulse at the wall than for an equivalent homogeneous mixture. In
the alternative mode, the wave structure alternates between multi-head
and single-head, with a global velocity in the range 0.7–1.9 DCJ [673].

6.1.5. Propagation in obstructed tube or channel

The seminal results of Peraldi et al. [539] have shown that the
propagation of detonation in tube or channel obstructed with orifice
plates can be significantly affected by the degree of congestion. If
the characteristic length-scale of the unobstructed area of the tube
is equal or slightly larger than the detonation cell width, detonation
can propagate with a quasi-constant velocity but significantly lower
than DCJ. Such a behavior was attributed to successive failure/re-
initiation cycles induced by the obstacles. This regime corresponds
to the ‘‘quasi-detonation regime’’. If the characteristic length-scale of
the unobstructed area of the tube gets larger than approximately 13λ,
then the influence of the obstacles on the detonation propagation is
much more limited and a propagation velocity close to the CJ velocity
is observed. In the past 7–8 years, the propagation of detonation in
tube/channel equipped with repeated obstacles has been extensively
studied using hydrogen-based mixtures. Various experimental arrange-
ments have been employed and provide new insights into the limit and
mechanism of detonation propagation in obstructed channels.

The orifice-plate arrangement remained the most popular one with
several studies performed in Canada [674–677], and China [678,679].
Cross and Ciccarelli [674] studied a classical DDT configuration as well
as the transmission of a fully developed CJ detonation into a section
with repeated obstacles. Similar behaviors and propagation limits were
observed for these two configurations. Motivated by the effect of BR,
which tends to decrease the propagation limit in obstructed channel,
Ciccarelli et al. [676] studied the effect of obstacles spacing on the
detonation propagation limits. They reported that the velocity deficit
in the quasi-detonation regime decreases as the obstacle spacing was
increased. The propagation limit was only weakly affected. Ciccarelli
and Cross [675] employed the soot foil technique while Rainsford
et al. [677] combined direct imaging and soot foils to gain further in-
sights into the propagation mechanism of quasi-detonation. Detonation
failure between the obstacles was attributed to detonation diffraction,
which leads to full decoupling of the leading shock and reaction zone.
The diffracting shock later reflects off the side walls, which leads
to hot spot formation and detonation re-initiation. As the detonation
propagation limit is progressively approached, the number of hot spot
decreases, and eventually, only a single hot spot is formed and ensures

81

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

detonation propagation. At the limit, successful global propagation of
the detonation can be achieved even though successful hot spot ignition
does not take place systematically behind each obstacle. For large
BR, single slapping detonation wave could be observed at near-limit
conditions. Possibly, detonation re-initiation could take place following
shock reflection off the upstream face of the obstacles when large BR
was used. Wang et al. [678] and Wang et al. [679] performed similar
experiments using a square channel and a cylindrical tube, respectively.
In general, they found that large obstacle spacing promotes faster
detonation propagation and extend the propagation domain. Their soot
foil records were consistent with those of Ciccarelli and Cross [675],
and they also confirmed the effects of BR and of the obstacle spacing
on the detonation velocity.

The fence-like arrangement in a square channel was also popularly
employed in recent years [680–683] because it enables visualizing
the detonation propagation, and possibly, performing simultaneous
soot-foil recording. Kellenberger and Ciccarelli [680] investigated the
propagation mechanism of quasi-detonation. Detonation failure was in-
duced by diffraction as the detonation exited the obstacles’ restriction.
Re-initiation was clearly observed to be related to shock focusing at
the channel centerline. These shocks originate from local explosions in
the reflected shock regions behind the obstacles. In a subsequent study,
Kellenberger and Ciccarelli [681] identified two near-limit modes of
propagation, a symmetric mode and an asymmetric mode for exper-
iments performed in a narrow channel. These are shown in Fig. 90.
The symmetric mode is characterized by simultaneous detonation ini-
tiation behind the top and bottom obstacles at each obstacle pair.
The asymmetric mode is characterized by detonation initiation behind
only one of the obstacles, alternating between the top and bottom
obstacles, leading to a ‘‘zig-zag’’ like propagation. Further study of
quasi-detonation was performed by Kellenberger and Ciccarelli [682,
683]. They found that a ‘‘single-head’’ mode of continuous propagation
can take place over a range of initial pressure if a wide channel
was employed. Unlike single-head detonation in round tube, which
are controlled by the acoustic characteristics of the tube, single-head
detonation in square channel are controlled by the obstacles geometry.
In other studies, more exotic obstacle designs and arrangements
were employed. Pinos and Ciccarelli [571] studied flame and deto-
nation propagation in a highly congested geometry with both inline
and staggered round obstacles. Sun et al. [684] studied detonation
propagation in a tube filled with tube bundle constituted of three to
five tubes. Wang and Ma [685] used repeated perforated plates and
studied the effects of the hole diameter and spacing, and of the plate
spacing. Chen et al. [686] investigated the detonation propagation
characteristics in tube obstructed by repeated circular obstacles and
studied the effects of BR, and obstacles spacing.

In general, the results obtained in all these studies, including those
performed with orifice plate, fence-like, or more exotic obstacles, were
overall consistent with the criteria of Peraldi et al. [539] and of Do-
rofeev et al. [173]. Nevertheless, some discrepancies may be observed
when a specific geometry, or particular configurations were employed,
including large BR and/or obstacle spacing. It is also noted that the cri-
terion indicating that CJ detonation could be observed for orifice plate
with open diameter larger than 13λ also failed for BR=0.5 [677]. Rains-
ford et al. [677] provide a comprehensive discussion on these aspects.
One interesting feature was observed by Pinos and Ciccarelli [571]
using banks of cylindrical obstacles. In the quasi-detonation regime, the
configuration with staggered cylinders induces a much lower velocity
deficit as compared to the configuration with inline cylinders. This fea-
ture was explained by the higher frequency of detonation re-initiation
enabled by the staggered cylinder configuration.

It should also be mentioned that detonation propagating in a chan-
nel equipped with obstacles with very large blockage ratio, such as an
orifice or slit plate, can be quenched altogether. Depending on various
parameters, including the reactivity of the mixture, the initial condi-
tions, the shape, the number, the layout, and the size of the orifice, etc,

detonation re-initiation can take place or not. Such a process has been
studied for hydrogen-based mixtures by several authors [687–690].
According to Chao et al. [687], a quasi-one-dimensional, supersonic,
turbulent interface between the burnt and unburnt gases that follows a
planar shock is formed downstream of the obstacle. Three-dimensional
numerical simulations [689] as well as schlieren imaging [688] indicate
that the flow field created by the interaction of the detonation wave
and the orifice plate may be significantly more complex. Unsteady
jets of combustion products are formed and are preceded by spherical
shock waves which interact with each other and with the walls. In
the studies that investigated detonation propagation in a tube/channel
equipped with orifice plates, detonation re-initiation was attributed to
(i) turbulent mixing between the hot combustion products and the fresh
mixture; or to (ii) shock focusing or shock reflection leading to the
formation of hot spot.

6.2. Near-limit detonation

Detonation propagation and sustenance are highly influenced by
the boundary conditions, i.e., the channel characteristic length-scale.
Although a domain of detonability can be measured or estimated based
on certain considerations, it remains a difficult task to define absolute
limits since these are intrinsically related to the characteristics length-
scale of the facility with respect to the characteristic length-scale of
the detonation, i.e., essentially the cell width. In the vicinity of the
limits, the detonation propagation may exhibit a range of very specific
behaviors, which are typically accompanied by a modification of the
structure of the detonation as compared to what is observed well within
the detonability domain. The knowledge and understanding of the
dynamics of near-limit detonation is particularly important for safety
assessment since such detonation are the most likely to be formed.

6.2.1. On the definition of detonation limits

As discussed by Lee [586] and other authors, see [691,692] and
references therein, the experimental determination or the prediction of
a detonability domain requires first to provide an operational definition
of the limits. While some authors have argued that the detonation limit
should be based on the change of structure that is taking place as the
detonation approaches the limits, other authors have proposed that the
detonation stability, based on the local velocity fluctuations, should be
considered to define the limit. The onset of single-head, or spinning,
detonation has been proposed as a criterion to determine the detonation
limits. Nevertheless, it could be argued that, beyond the regime of
spinning detonation, the propagation of detonation is still possible
and is achieved through the highly unstable, stuttering and galloping
modes. Thus, the onset of spinning detonation could be viewed as the
limit for stable detonation propagation. For risk assessment, it is usual
to adopt the most conservative criterion, and thus, it seems appropriate
to consider the onset or disappearance of galloping detonation as the
limit.

6.2.2. Propagation under loss conditions and detonation limits
6.2.2.1. Experimental results.
In general, detonation limits are deter-
mined by using annular or narrow channels, or tubes for which various
losses become strong enough to affect detonation propagation and
possibly induce failure. Considering a specific mixture, at a given
equivalence ratio, dilution level, and initial pressure and temperature,
the characteristic length of the channel/tube can be progressively
decreased until no detonation propagation is possible anymore. For
a tube, this critical diameter is frequently referred to as ‘‘limiting
tube diameter’’ (dl). Table 9 gives the limiting diameters as a func-
tion of equivalence ratio for hydrogen–air mixtures at near-ambient
conditions [693].

A strong dependence on the equivalence ratio can be observed.
Estimating the detonation limits by determining limiting tube diameter
is not necessarily a very practical approach since a series of tube

with various diameters need to be available. As a consequence, the
characteristic length-scale of the detonation facility is often fixed and
the initial pressure is progressively decreased to make the mixture less
and less sensitive to detonation. This approach enables to define a
limiting initial pressure at which detonation failure occurs. Xiao and

Weng [694] recently summarized the experimental results obtained in
narrow channel and small diameter tube for hydrogen–oxygen mixtures
with and without diluent. Fig. 91 shows the evolution of the average
detonation velocity as a function of the ratio of the channel width, or
tube diameter, to the induction zone length of a quasi-steady detonation
wave.

As the characteristics length-scale of the channel/tube decreases,
losses get more and more important and the detonation velocity deficit
increases. It reaches a minimum value in the range 0.75–0.85 DCJ,
depending on the specific mixtures and conditions, before failure oc-
curs [695]. Such experiments are sometime combined with soot foil
diagnostics and show that the detonation structure is modified and
transform to a single-headed, or spinning, detonation in the vicinity
of the limiting pressure, see Shi et al. [696] for recent examples in
hydrogen–oxygen mixtures. It is also noted that a particular narrow
channel facility equipped with exponential horn shaped ramp can
provide a constant lateral mass divergence and enables to study the

near-limit propagation of detonation, see Xiao and Radulescu [697] for
results obtained with hydrogen–oxygen–argon mixtures.

The initial temperature can impact the detonation limits. Pawel
et al. [693] studied the effect of initial temperature on the detonation
limits for hydrogen–oxygen and hydrogen–air mixtures. They employed
long tubes with inner diameters in the range 4 to 26 mm. For a fixed
initial pressure of 101 kPa, and initial temperatures of 195 and 295 K,
they reported that the range of equivalence ratio over which stable
propagation was observed was narrower at lower temperature. The
study of Zitoun et al. [639] indicated that, at low initial pressure, an
extension of the detonability domain as the initial temperature was
decreased from 293 to 123 K.

The effect of scale on the detonation limits has been presented pre-
viously in this manuscript while discussing the DDT limits observed in
large-scale facilities such as the one employed by Dorofeev et al. [173].
Briefly, it was shown that detonation onset can be observed for quite
insensitive mixtures, as long as the characteristic dimension of the
facility can accommodate 7λ [173,581], despite the very large deto-
nation cell of such mixtures. This significantly complicates defining an
absolute detonation limit, but, in absence of newer results, the lowest
concentration of 12.5% of H2 in air for which Dorofeev et al. [173]
observed DDT may be considered as the detonation limit.

It is also noted that the properties of the walls, such as their rough-
ness or their porosity, can have a dramatic impact on the detonation
limits.

Concerning wall roughness, opposite effects on the propagation of
detonation can be observed depending on whether the conditions are
well within the detonability domain or close to the limit [586]. For
highly sensitive mixtures, wall roughness results in a strong increase of
the velocity deficit. On the other hand, close to the limit, rough walls
may enable a detonation to propagate at a velocity much lower than the
CJ velocity, on the order of D∕DCJ = 0.4–0.5. Under such conditions,
the shock front and the reaction zone remain coupled and propagate
at a similar velocity but with a large separation distance between
them. Sequence of schlieren images obtained for a stoichiometric H2-
O2 mixture enabled to characterize the main features of low-velocity
detonation propagation in a channel with very rough walls, see Figure
7.26 in [586]. A tulip shape of the reaction zone is observed. The
complex reflections of the transverse waves at the walls and their
interactions with the turbulent reaction zone enhance the energy re-
lease rate which enables maintaining the propagation of the detonation
although auto-ignition is not possible due to the low speed of the shock
front. Recent results on the propagation of detonation in tube with very
rough walls were obtained by Zhang [698]. A stoichiometric hydrogen–
oxygen mixture was employed along with several Shchelkin spirals to
create different levels of roughness. While below a certain roughness

level, it was found that the detonability domain was extended, above
this threshold, roughness appeared to promote detonation failure and
the formation of a deflagration wave with velocity on the order of 0.4
DCJ.

Porous, or acoustically absorbent walls, induce a strong divergence
of the flow behind the shocks and generates expansion waves as the
supersonic flow is choked at its entrance in the pores. This mechanism
weakens the transverse wave of the detonation, and can lead to detona-
tion quenching. As a detonation propagates in the tube equipped with a
porous wall section, the detonation front is getting progressively wider
and eventually, the shock front and the reaction zone decouple, and
the detonation fails [586]. Mazaheri et al. [699] studied experimentally
and numerically the effect of porous wall on the propagation of detona-
tion in hydrogen-based mixtures. The simulations were performed with
a 1-step Arrhenius chemical model whose characteristics were represen-
tative of the highly regular H2-O2-Ar mixture used in the experiments.
In the numerical simulations, a curved detonation front, a velocity
deficit, and an increase of the irregularity of the cellular structure were
observed when porous walls were employed. For slow overall reaction
rate, the transverse waves were suppressed and the detonation failed.
These features are illustrated in Fig. 92. A consistent behavior was
observed experimentally; no unreacted gas pockets were formed behind
the front, which indicates the cellular structure did not transition to
high irregularity. Wang et al. [700] studied the propagation of detona-
tion in tubes with smooth and porous walls. Hydrogen–oxygen mixtures
diluted with nitrogen or argon were employed. They identified a critical
pressure above which self-sustained detonation propagation could be
achieved, and below which the detonation fails and a deflagration
with a velocity in the range 0.4–0.5 DCJ was measured. At the critical
pressure, they found that the ratio d∕λ is equal to 6–9, where d is the
tube diameter. Rao et al. [701] investigated the effect on detonation
propagation of the addition of a layer of polyacrylonitrile-based carbon
fiber onto the walls of a cylindrical tube. All the experiments were
performed with a stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture initially at 293
K and 100 kPa, while various thicknesses and layouts of the absorbing
layer were employed. To characterized the effect of the porous mate-
rial, the authors measured the velocity/intensity attenuation indices,
defined as the drop of velocity/pressure induced by porous walls with
respect to the average velocity/pressure in a tube without porous walls.
Large values of the attenuation indices are favored by thick, long,
and large layers of absorbing material. From these studies and other
previous work [702], it is well established that acoustically absorbent
walls would tend to reduce the detonability domain.

6.2.2.2. Theoretical models. Essentially two theoretical models can be
used to estimate the detonation limits: (i) the acoustic theory of spin-
ning detonation; and (ii) the quasi-steady detonation model. Below, we
recall the main features of these two models.

The acoustic theory has been developed independently by several
authors [703–706], see discussion in chapter 6 of Lee [586]. It describes
the dynamics of spinning detonation, which are characterized by a
stationary structure composed of a weak incident shock, a strong Mach
stem, and a strong transverse wave with two abrupt changes of slope.
The spinning, or single-head, detonation describes a helical path along
the inner wall with an average velocity that may be close to the CJ
one, i.e., 0.95 DCJ. The acoustic theory basically consists in determining
the critical conditions, in terms of composition, pressure, temperature,
for which a detonation propagates according to the spinning mode. If
considering that the detonation limit is achieved at the onset of the
spinning mode, then, the acoustic theory enables to predict such a limit.
The limiting tube diameter is given by

dl = λ

where knm is the mth root of the first derivative of the Bessel function;
and γ is the heat capacity ratio.

It is also noted that three dimensional numerical simulations of
spinning detonation, that include detailed chemistry for hydrogen–air
mixtures, were performed by Tsuboi et al. [707] and could potentially
be used to estimate detonation limits, if the boundary conditions can
be properly taken into account.

The other main approach to estimate detonation limits relies on
quasi-steady detonation models. Such detonation models include ad-
ditional source terms that describe losses induced by divergence (Fay-
type) or by heat transfer and friction at the wall (Zeldovich-type). It is
noted that for the Fay-type model, there are two ways of calculating
the boundary layer displacement thickness, depending on whether the
boundary layer is considered as turbulent or laminar. For a given rate
of loss, there are only few possible sub-CJ detonation velocities that
enables the flow to become sonic without the solution of the system of
equations becoming singular. Typically, diverging curves are obtained
when plotting the detonation velocity as a function of initial pressure,

which enables to define a critical pressure for self-sustained detona-
tion propagation. Recent applications of these quasi-steady models to
study detonation in hydrogen-based mixtures include the works of Shi
et al. [696], Veiga-Lopez et al. [708], and Weng et al. [709]. Xiao and
Weng [694] and Higgins [710] gave comprehensive descriptions of the
derivation and characteristics of the Fay-type and Zeldovich-type quasi-
steady detonation models, and the interested reader is invited to refer
to these publications for further details. As seen in Fig. 93, the critical
pressure for detonation failure in hydrogen-based mixtures can be
predicted with very good accuracy or within a factor of approximately
two, depending of the type of quasi-steady model and the conditions
employed.

It is noted that Radulescu and Lee [702] developed a modified
quasi-steady detonation model that account for the additional flow
divergence induced by porous wall. This model can be employed to pre-
dict the detonation limits in tube equipped with wall of given porosity
and reasonable agreement was obtained for mixtures with low reduced
activation energy,i.e., within 30%, while for irregular mixtures, large
discrepancy were observed, i.e., up to 2100% difference.

On the other hand, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no theory
that predicts the onset of highly unstable detonation modes, such as
stuttering and galloping detonation.

6.2.3. Propagation of highly unstable detonation

According to the classification of Lee et al. [711], there are six
modes of detonation propagation. The first mode corresponds to the
stable propagation mode. It is observed away from the limits, as the
cell width is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the
channel. It is characterized by a constant velocity close to the CJ
velocity, and the absence of fluctuations. This behavior is similar for
regular and irregular detonations. The second mode corresponds to the
rapid fluctuation mode and is observed as the cell width is comparable
to the characteristic length scale of the channel. The propagation
is characterized by low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations of the
velocity and an average velocity deficit on the order of 10%–20% DCJ.
Such a behavior may also be observed for regular and irregular detona-
tions. The third (stuttering) and fourth (galloping) modes of detonation

propagation are highly unstable and are observed only in highly irreg-
ular mixtures. Stuttering detonations are characterized by an average
velocity on the order of 0.7 DCJ and two types of velocity oscillations:
(i) large-amplitude, low-frequency oscillation, and (ii) low-amplitude,
high-frequency oscillation. Galloping detonation are characterized by
an average velocity on the order of 0.5–0.7 DCJ and demonstrate only
very large-amplitude (0.5 to 1.5 DCJ), low-frequency oscillations of
velocity. Mode five corresponds to the so-called low-velocity mode.
The velocity profile indicates that the high-velocity detonation progres-
sively fails and that the combustion wave velocity stabilizes around
0.4–0.5 DCJ. Weak fluctuations on the order of few m/s are observed in
the velocity history. In this regime, the reaction zone and the leading
shock wave are separated by a large distance [712]. This separation
distance remains rather constant over long distances. Beyond the low-
velocity mode, detonation failure (mode 6) occurs and deflagrative
propagation may take place. Overall, the galloping behavior is favored
by small diameter tube, high mixture irregularity, and low-pressure
conditions. Gao et al. [713] reviewed the experimental and numerical
studies performed on galloping detonation and provided a list of mix-
tures and conditions for which such highly unstable detonation were
observed. A detailed review of the literature [714] enabled us to find
few more studies which have examined the potential of detonation
propagating in hydrogen-based mixtures for featuring a galloping-like
behavior.

Because highly unstable detonations are typically observed in mix-
tures with highly irregular cellular structure, such as propane–oxygen
or methane–oxygen, it could be expected that stuttering and gallop-
ing modes of propagation are not favored in hydrogen-based mix-
tures. Several studies have investigated the near-limit behavior of these
mixtures. In the pioneering work by Mooradian and Gordon [715],
cycles of normal detonation propagation, spin, failure, and finally
re-initiation were evidenced in a 10 m long tube with inner diame-
ter of 20 mm for a lean hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen mixtures with a
nitrogen content up to 65%. Edwards et al. [716] combined several ex-
perimental techniques, including microwave interferometry, soot foil,
and spark-schlieren imaging, to investigate the dynamics of galloping
detonation in various mixtures including hydrogen–oxygen(-diluent)
mixtures where the diluents were either N2 or Ar. Mixtures containing
large amount of argon did not feature a galloping behavior, which
was less pronounced in hydrogen- than in propane-based mixtures.
Ul’yanitskii [717] studied near-limit detonation in a 7 m long tube
with 12.8 mm inner diameter. For H2-O2, a galloping behavior was ef-
fectively observed, but such a feature disappeared for nitrogen-diluted

mixtures and the detonation failed. Dupré et al. [691,692,718] per-
formed a series of studies using tubes of decreasing diameter, from
152 to 38 mm, connected to each other by 180◦ bends. The length
of each tube was between 5.66 and 11 m, depending on the studies.
In some of these studies, a short section of acoustically absorbent wall
was placed to eliminate the perturbations induced by the sharp bend.
To promote detonation re-initiation, a section with rough walls was also
placed after the acoustically absorbent wall. Galloping-like behavior
was observed for some lean H2-air mixtures. Ishi and Grönig [719]
employed a 14 m long tube with inner diameter of 45 mm. Stoi-
chiometric H2-O2(-N2/Ar) mixtures were used for the experiments.
Stuttering and galloping detonations were observed for high nitrogen-
dilution (70%), while only the stuttering behavior could be observed
for mixtures diluted with 50% of N2 or Ar. Ishii et al. [720] studied
detonation propagation in narrow gaps (0.8 to 3 mm) between two
horizontal plates of 500 mm in length. Hydrogen–oxygen mixtures with
an equivalence ratio in the range 0.2–2.5 and Ar-dilution between 0
and 82% were employed. As the gap was reduced below a critical
value, large velocity fluctuations resembling a galloping behavior were
observed. Given the very short length of the plates, it remains unclear
whether the large velocity fluctuations observed could be considered
as representative of a stuttering/galloping detonation or not. While
several studies have reported unstable detonations in hydrogen-based
mixtures, some discrepancies exist, and the detailed conditions for
which such detonations can be formed remains unclear. In general,
stuttering and galloping detonation can be observed in H2-O2 and lean
H2-O2-N2/air mixtures. For stoichiometric mixtures diluted with N2, it
seems the amount of nitrogen has to be above a certain threshold for
stuttering and galloping detonation to be formed. In mixtures diluted
with Ar, highly unstable detonation were never reported except by Ishi
and Grönig [719].

Concerning numerical studies, very few studies were performed on
galloping detonation and the only study that employed detailed chem-
ical kinetics was performed by Tsuboi et al. [721]. They considered a
stoichiometric H2-air mixture at low-pressure in channels with heights
of 5, 10 and 15 mm and included only viscous losses. The velocity pro-
files demonstrated fluctuations only in the range 0.85–1.1 DCJ, which
is not very consistent with the experimental observations. Their simu-
lations predicted hot-spot ignition in the boundary layer due to viscous
heating but this is likely due to the adiabatic wall assumption made in
their study and should not be expected to take place experimentally
because of unavoidable heat losses at the wall. A more consistent
behavior of galloping detonation was obtained in the 1D study of Aksa-
mento et al. [722], who employed stoichiometric methane–oxygen and

hydrogen–oxygen mixtures. Although a number of assumptions were
made to establish the governing equations, succession of low-velocity
propagation, re-initiation, high-velocity propagation, and failure, sim-
ilar to experimentally observed galloping cycles, could be reproduced,
as shown in Fig. 94.

6.2.4. Detonation limit in partially confined and unconfined vapor cloud

Detonation sustenance is strongly favored by highly confined condi-
tions, which results in the fact that detonation limits are different under
confined and semi-confined/unconfined conditions.

Detonation limits under partially unconfined conditions have been
studied in the framework of nuclear safety [643,723,724], and of
the development of rotating detonation engine [725,726]. Most of
these studies focused on the critical conditions for the sustenance of
detonation in a semi-confined layer of reactive gas located between a
solid wall and a layer of non-reactive gas. Under such conditions, the
failure of detonation is typically attributed to excessive curvature, triple
point loss at the reactive/non-reactive gas interface, the presence of an
expansion fan due to shock wave refraction at the gas/gas interface. In
a pioneering study, Guirao et al. [643] estimated the critical height for
successful detonation propagation in partially confined clouds based on
cell width measurements and semi-empirical correlations. The critical
height (h∗) for a semi-confined configuration was taken as h∗ = 5λ. The
estimation was extended to a fully unconfined case, and yielded h∗ =
6.5λ. A series of experiments were performed by Rudy et al. [271,723]
and Grune et al. [724] using large- and small-scale facilities. Hydrogen–
air and hydrogen–oxygen mixtures with various amounts of hydrogen,
under both uniform and non-uniform conditions, were employed. It
was found that the critical ratio h∗∕λ for self-sustained detonation
propagation increases as the height of the gas layer is increased. For
layer heights of 0.3, 3, and 60 cm, h∗∕λ was respectively of 2, 3, and
13. Under similar conditions, the critical layer height h∗ was found
equal to 3λ for a uniform mixture, but increased to 5-6λ for a non-
uniform mixture. The critical channel width (w∗) for self-sustained
propagation was also determined by using two yielding side walls.
The following relationship at critical conditions was obtained: w∗ =
4.9 − 5.5λ. Several experimental [725] and numerical [726] studies
were performed to determine the critical conditions for self-sustained
detonation propagation under conditions relevant to RDE, which are
similar to the ones considered in [271,723,724]. Using high-resolution
2D simulations performed with detailed chemistry, Taileb et al. [726]
determined the critical height of a semi-confined reactive gas layer

allowing successful propagation for a stoichiometric hydrogen–oxygen
mixture. For initial pressure and temperature of 100 kPa and 300 K,
they found a critical height of 6 mm, corresponding to about 8λ, which
is overall consistent with experimental measurement of 4.6 mm [725].
Further experiments were recently performed by Metrow et al. [727]
for semi-confined reactive layers formed by a gravity current between
an inert layer and a reactive hydrogen-based mixture. They reported a
critical height of 2-3λ for a H2-O2-N2 mixture with Φ = 2.5 and 24%
nitrogen, while the inert layer was pure Ar.

Bauwens and Dorofeev [437] considered a different configuration
by studying the detonability of a non-uniform hydrogen cloud formed
into air by a high-pressure hydrogen jet. They proposed a methodology
to estimate the volume and location of detonable gas in the vapor cloud.
The model is based on a comprehensive review of the critical conditions
for detonation propagation in semi-confined environment and in non-
uniform mixtures. It assumes that detonation is possible if the height
of the detonable region is at least equal to 5λ, and that the transverse
gradient of concentration is smooth enough so that dλ/dx is less than
0.1. As shown in Fig. 95, the detonable region predicted by the model
is rather small, and is located at a distance of several meters from the
orifice, essentially along an horizontal line with the orifice center.

6.3. Direct detonation initiation

As detailed in the previous section, detonation can be initiated
through the complex FA and DDT processes. In practice, this is the
scenario that would be taking place under most cases. Nevertheless,
detonation can also be initiated directly, as a large amount of en-
ergy is rapidly deposited within a restricted volume. Direct detonation
initiation (DDI) is a complex, transient process which involves shock
wave physics and chemical kinetics. The knowledge of the amount of
energy required to initiate directly a detonation in a given mixture is of
primary importance for the assessment of detonation hazard for a large
number of industrial activities including manufacturing processes and
nuclear energy production.

6.3.1. Direct initiation by a point energy source

Direct initiation of a detonation is achieved if the ignition source
is able to create on its own the critical conditions for detonation to
be formed and flame acceleration processes are not involved in any
way in the formation of the detonation [586]. When a point energy
source is employed, a strong blast wave is formed and propagates

spherically, which justifies that direct initiation is also referred to
as ‘‘blast wave initiation’’. The shock wave initiates chemical energy
release and couples with the reaction zone to form an over-driven
detonation. Depending on the amount of energy introduced, the over-
driven detonation might decay until a CJ detonation is formed, in case
of successful ignition, or until it becomes an acoustic wave, in case of
failure.

Three regimes of spherical detonation initiation are observed de-
pending on the energy density of the source igniter. The schlieren
images obtained by Bach et al. [728] provide a comprehensive view of
the direct detonation process. If the energy density is below a critical
threshold, i.e., the critical energy for direct initiation, the sub-critical
regime is observed. Initially, the shock front and the reaction zone
are coupled. However, after a short period of time, the reaction zone
decouples from the shock front and the distance between the two fronts
increases with time. The trajectory of the shock front during the early
times is consistent with the trajectory predicted by the reactive blast
wave theory but then, the two trajectories diverge as the chemical
energy release is not available anymore to sustain the shock due to
the decoupling [586]. For an energy density above the critical energy
for direct initiation, the reaction zone and the shock front are always
coupled. The detonation rapidly decays to a CJ detonation and the
characteristic cellular instability is observed. The experimental trajec-
tory of the shock front closely agrees with the theoretical reactive
blast wave trajectory. This is the super-critical regime. For an energy
density near the critical threshold, the early stages are similar to the
ones observed for the sub-critical case: (i) initially, an over-driven
detonation is formed; then (ii) decoupling of the shock front and the
reaction zone is taking place. However, at near critical condition, the
shock and reaction zone propagate at a sub-CJ, quasi-steady metastable
velocity for some time before local explosions are taking place and
overdriven detonation bubbles are created. The detonation bubbles
propagate preferentially in the pre-conditioned shocked gas volume
between the spherical shock front and the spherical reaction zone.
Eventually, an asymmetric expanding detonation is formed [586].

While direct detonation initiation was most frequently studied for
homogeneous mixture, Sochet et al. [729] investigated the critical
conditions for direct initiation in mixtures characterized by concentra-
tion gradients. They obtained the gradients by filling a soap bubble
with a H2-O2 mixture, and then by rupturing the bubble so that a
gradient can established itself by diffusion of the reactive mixture into
the surrounding air. The steepness of the gradient was controlled by
changing the time between the bubble rupture and ignition of the
exploding wire by an electrical impulse. They identified a critical time
of diffusion above which detonation cannot be directly initiated, which
depends on the given energy provided and the volume of the gaseous
charge. The authors also reported that the charge only partly detonates
if either the diffusion time or the nominal energy are close to their
critical values.

6.3.2. Direct initiation by shock focusing

It should be noted that direct initiation may also be achieved by
shock focusing. A number of experimental and numerical studies have

Gelfand et al. [730], Khomik et al. [731], and Smirnov et al. [99,
732] studied experimentally the initiation of detonation by shock focus-
ing. Experiments were typically performed in a shock tube equipped
with a reflector of different size or shape at the end-wall. Different
mode of detonation onset, including direct initiation, and DDT were
observed under focusing conditions. These two modes of detonation
initiation were further confirmed through numerical simulations by
Smirnov et al. [99,732] and Bengoechea et al. [733]. A typical exam-
ple of detonation initiation event is shown in Fig. 96. There exist a

be created at focus can lead to extremely rapid auto-ignition, which
triggers detonation. The critical Mach number for detonation onset
decreases as the size of the reflector or the reactivity of the mixture
were increased. On the other hand, the shape of the reflector had only a
small influence on the critical Mach number. Utkin et al. [734] studied
experimentally and numerically different shock focusing arrangements
including multi-focusing ones. The experimental results clearly demon-
strated that reflection at curvilinear surfaces led to shorter ignition
delay-time than reflection at a flat surface. The numerical study relied
on the utilization of a one-step model. They found that the arrangement
with two distributed reflectors was in general more efficient to initiate
detonation. They identified a critical Mach number of the incident
shock of 2.5 for detonation initiation to take place.

6.3.3. Critical initiation energy

The critical initiation energy (Ec) has been measured in a number
of studies. Table 10 summarizes the experimental values for hydrogen–
air mixtures over a wide range of compositions, for ambient and
near-ambient conditions.

It is clear that, even for near-stoichiometric mixtures, several kJ are
required to initiate directly a spherical detonation in such mixtures.
Owing to the large dependency of Ec on the detonation cell width,
or induction zone length, significantly lower values are required to di-
rectly initiate a detonation in hydrogen–oxygen mixtures. Kamenskihs
et al. [736] measured Ec for such highly reactive mixtures at initial
pressure up to 2 MPa. The results are shown in Fig. 97. For a stoichio-
metric mixture, Ec decreases from about 30 J at 0.1 MPa, to 0.2 J at
1 MPa. Above this initial pressure, Ec is essentially constant, which
was attributed by the authors to the extended second-explosion limit.
Under cryogenic conditions, Zitoun et al. [639] reported that, at sub-
atmospheric initial pressure, the critical energy increases with initial
temperature, while at near-atmospheric pressure, the critical energy
decreases as initial temperature is increased. It is also noted that some
experiments on critical detonation initiation in cylindrical geometry
were performed by some authors [737]. In this case, a cylindrical cord
of high explosive was employed rather than a spherical energy source.
Because of the non-instantaneous release of energy along the cord, the
detonation takes on a structure similar to that observed around high-
velocity projectiles. For a hydrogen–air mixture with Φ = 0.7–0.8, the
authors reported a critical energy of 30 kJ/m, corresponding to an
invariant explosion length of 55 cm.

It is important to note that, as pointed out by Eckett et al. [264], the
experimental values of critical initiation energy should be considered
with care. They pointed out that: (i) the resolution of the experimental
‘‘GO-NO GO’’ data may be quite low; (ii) different type of ignitors,
including exploding wire, electric spark, solid explosive, may lead
to very different Ec ; (iii) some data in the literature were obtained
indirectly; and (iv) low and high Ec , respectively obtained for highly
and weakly sensitive mixtures, are difficult to obtain and are likely
affected by a large uncertainty due to various non-ideal effects.

6.3.4. Theoretical models for predicting the critical initiation energy

As detailed in [586], theoretical studies on DDI can be traced back
to the pioneering work of Zeldovich et al. [738], who established the
early version of the blast wave theory. The Zeldovich condition has
been proposed to determine Ec . It indicates that the time spent by the
spherical blast wave at a velocity above DCJ should be at least equal
to the induction time for successful detonation onset to take place.
Quantitatively, this theory largely under-estimates the experimental
critical energy [739]. The blast wave theory was further improved
over the years and its modern version has been established by Lee and
Matsui [640]. They proposed that, at critical conditions, the surface
area of the spherical blast wave should be at least equal to the surface
of a planar detonation that can sustain a critical diffraction from a
cylindrical tube. This theory generally provides reliable estimates of Ec
and is still employed nowadays, see [736,739].

Two theoretical studies that provide readily applicable expressions
to calculate the critical initiation energy correspond to the critical
curvature (CC) model of He and Clavin [740], and the critical decay
rate (CDR) model of Eckett et al. [264]. They both employ the Eu-
ler equations but rely on opposite assumptions concerning the main
mechanism responsible for initiation failure. The CC model considers
that curvature is the dominant quenching mechanism and that the
detonation behaves as a quasi-steady wave during near-critical DDI.
These assumptions lead to the cancellation of the unsteady terms in
the Euler equations. Further assuming a square-wave reaction model,
and the Taylor–Sedov blast wave model, the authors could relate the
critical shock radius to the energy of a point source and provided a
global failure criterion. On the contrary, the authors of the CDR theory
emphasized that the curvature has a marginal contribution to the total
temperature gradient, does not provide any mechanism for quenching,
and cannot explain the failure of DDI in the planar geometry. They
considered that the main mechanism responsible for detonation failure
is unsteadiness, and neglected the curvature term. Using asymptotic
expansion in the limit of high activation energy, they established a
local failure criterion, that they further related to the energy of the
point source using the blast wave model of Korobeinikov. The resulting
analytical expression corresponds to the CDR model. The Ec predicted
by the CC and CDR models exhibited differences of approximately
three orders of magnitude, with the CC model providing the largest
values. Such large discrepancies were confirmed for different hydrogen-
based mixtures in several subsequent studies [741–743]. From the
comparison provided in Eckett et al. [264], the experimental Ec of

failure cases, see Fig. 99. The results of Kasimov and Stewart clearly
indicate that critical ignition can take place at a velocity significantly
below and a radius significantly smaller than the ones of the turning
point of the D − κ curve obtained by considering a quasi-steady deto-
nation wave. These results tend to show that, while the overall behavior
of a critical diverging detonation shows similarity with the quasi-steady
behavior, unsteadiness cannot be ignored. Kasimov and Stewart further
demonstrated the good capabilities of their model to predict Ec for
hydrogen-based mixtures when using a 1-step Arrhenius model. Quan-
titatively, these results are rather consistent with the predictions of the
CDR model, whereas they are about three orders of magnitude lower
than the predictions of the CC model. One drawback of this approach
is that the determination of the critical energy is not straight forward
if a detailed reaction model is employed, and an iterative numerical
approach is required to integrate the chemical source term from the
detonation front to the sonic point while respecting the generalized CJ
condition, see Soury and Mazaheri [744].

Recently, Clavin et al. [745] performed further theoretical analy-
sis of the DDI process, considering curvature, unsteadiness, and the
gradient of the burnt gas flow. They considered stable and weakly
unstable detonation in the limit of small heat release, and focused on
the dynamics of the sonic point. They argued that direct initiation is
achieved if the sonic point penetrates into the reaction zone and shields
it from the expansion originating from the rear. On the contrary, if the
sonic point cannot catch up with the reaction zone because of a too
high decay rate, failure occurs. Despite these noteworthy observations,
the authors did not provide an expression to calculate Ec.

For completeness, it is also noted that Vasiliev [656] discussed
some theoretical models that can be used to predict Ec , that Bratov
et al. [746] proposed a new criterion for detonation initiation in gas
based on the incubation-time concept, and that Liu et al. [747] have
proposed a model to predict Ec based on the critical decay time
concept.

As mentioned above, the experimental determination of the critical
energy for direct detonation initiation is very complex, which compli-
cates the assessment of the accuracy of the theoretical approaches to
predict this quantity. In addition, the cubic dependency of the critical
energy on the induction time/distance results in a large sensitivity
of the predicted Ec on chemical kinetics. From the comparisons pro-
vided by Eckett et al. [264], Kasimov and Stewart [741], Soury and
Mazaheri [744], and Weng et al. [743], it might be concluded that
models that account for the impact of unsteadiness demonstrate better
quantitative agreement with experimental data, as compared to the
critical curvature model.

6.3.5. Numerical studies on direct initiation
6.3.5.1. One-dimensional numerical simulation. Owing to the symme-
try of the combustion wave propagation during direct initiation, and
because of the large cost of multi-dimensional simulations, a large num-
ber of studies employed one-dimensional approaches to numerically
investigate the dynamics of direct detonation initiation.

In its simplest form, and in one dimension, the direct detona-
tion initiation process demonstrates some similarities with the one-
dimensional shock tube problem [748]. A strong shock wave is formed
as the high-pressure and high-temperature ignition region rapidly ex-
pands. Depending on the initial strength of the blast wave, its decay
rate, and the properties of the mixture, detonation initiation or failure
may take place. In some study, such as the one of Korytchenkoa
et al. [749], additional complications were accounted for by model-
ing the details of the plasma-related processes occurring in the spark
channel in addition to those occurring in the gas phase behind the
shock wave. They showed that the low efficiency of the capacitive
discharge is due to the very low fraction of the total energy converted
into kinetic energy. A large fraction of the energy was consumed
by dissociative processes. Such processes are not taken into account
in most other studies. A pioneering numerical study was performed

hydrogen-based mixtures was better reproduced by the CDR model
except for near-stoichiometric H2-air mixtures. In addition to the dif-
ference in the main assumption concerning the quasi-steady/unsteady
nature of the detonation wave during detonation initiation, the CC
and CDR models also differ through the blast wave model that they
employed to relate the critical conditions to the energy of the point
source. As indicated above, the CC model relies on the Taylor–Sedov
blast wave model, while the CDR model relies on the Korobeinikov
model. Weng et al. [743] recently verified that the large discrepancies
between the Ec predictions of the CC and CDR models are not related
to the difference in the blast wave models. Fig. 98 compares the
experimental and predicted Ec for hydrogen–air mixtures. Clearly, the
choice of the blast wave model can modify the calculated Ec by up to
several orders of magnitude. Comparison of Fig. 98 with figure 1.19 in
Eckett et al. [264] demonstrates the very large impact of the choice of
the reaction model in the predicted Ec. Regardless of the choice of the
blast wave model and of the reaction mechanism, the CC model always
predicts a much larger critical energy than the CDR model. Further
discussions about this aspect are provided in Weng et al. [743].

Kasimov and Stewart [741] proposed an evolution equation that
accounts for both curvature and unsteadiness and contains an embed-
ded sonic point. For slowly evolving weakly-curved detonation, they
identified an ignition separatrix which separates successful ignition and

with detailed chemistry by He [750]. Consistent with the CC theory,
it was shown that direct initiation can be achieved if the trajectory
of the wave crosses the upper branch of the quasi-steady detonation
curve. However, it was also shown that, even if the above condition
is respected, the 1D longitudinal instability can lead to detonation
quenching. Im and Yu [751] also employed detailed chemistry and
followed the approach of Eckett et al. [264] to investigate the relative
contributions of chemical heat release, curvature, and unsteadiness,
to the total derivative of temperature along the path of Lagrangian
particles during an unsuccessful DDI simulation. Consistent with the
CDR theory [264], they observed that the total derivative of tempera-
ture is largely dominated by the contributions of unsteadiness and heat
release, while the curvature term has only a very small amplitude, see
Fig. 100. Soury and Mazaheri [744] observed that in the sub-critical
regime, the pressure behind the shock becomes larger than the pressure
at the shock front, which leads to the formation of an expansion wave
which spreads toward the shock and weakens it. For successful ignition,
such a process was not observed and amplification of the leading shock
was achieved. The authors also indicated that reasonable predictions
of Ec could be achieved when applying the theory of Kasimov and
Steward [741] while employing multi-step chemistry. The state of the
fresh gas can also significantly influence the value of Ec. As shown
in Fig. 101, Qi and Chen [752] studied the effect of a local cold
or hot spot on the DDI process. They found that DDI was promoted
by a cold spot of small amplitude or a hot spot of large amplitude.
On the other hand, a cold spot of large amplitude or a hot spot of
small amplitude inhibited detonation initiation. They attributed these
behaviors to the competing effects induced by the local temperature
perturbation on the overall reaction rate and the volumetric energy
density. Most recently, Xie et al. [753] studied DDI in a weakly unstable
hydrogen-based mixture. They showed that the flow evolution within
both the induction and reaction zones can be described by combining
the shock change equation, the gradient evolution equations, and the
ZND model. While 1D simulation constitutes an interesting canonical
configuration to study the main dynamics of the DDI process, the
detonation quenching induced by strong pulsating behavior limits its
applicability to unstable mixtures.

6.3.5.2. Two-dimensional numerical simulation. Asahara et al. [754]
studied the dynamics of diverging cylindrical detonation by performing
two-dimensional numerical simulation with detailed chemistry. Quali-
tatively, the behaviors observed for the cylindrical detonations are very
similar to the one observed experimentally. In the sub-critical regime,
the cellular structure rapidly disappears. In the near-critical regime, the
variations of the cell width are important and spatially inhomogeneous.
In the super-critical regime, the cellular structure is minimally affected
during the direct initiation process. The authors found that, following
a transient period, the number of triple points increases at a linear
rate, which maintains the mean cell width approximately constant.
The length of the transient period increases with the energy of the
point source, while the rate of triple point generation is independent
of the input energy. The authors also noted the presence of unburnt
gas pockets. A similar study was recently performed by Jia et al. [755]
who focused on the effects of the ignition source characteristics and of
composition gradient.

Han et al. [756] and Shen and Parsani [757] studied DDI in two
dimensions using one-step irreversible chemical models. The study of
Han et al. [756] was limited to regular detonation structure similar to
the one of a highly-Ar diluted hydrogen–oxygen mixture. Unlike what
was observed for a planar geometry, for a cylindrical geometry, the
shock decay rate is higher for the 2D case than for the 1D case. This
behavior was attributed to the formation of pockets of unreacted gas
behind the curved detonation front, which delays the energy release,
see Fig. 102. Consequently, the cellular instability tends to inhibit the
direct initiation of detonation. Shen and Parsani [757] extended the
work of Han et al. [756] to highly unstable detonations and focused on

the effect of cellular instability on Ec . For weakly unstable detonation,
they found that the direct initiation process is essentially similar in 1D
and 2D. For moderately unstable detonation, several critical energies
could be identified in the 1D simulations, but only one Ec was found in
the 2D simulations. In highly unstable mixtures, direct initiation in 1D
always failed, but could be successfully achieved in 2D. They attributed
this feature to the dual role of instability, which can either promote
local ignition at hot spots due to the formation of strong transverse
waves in 2D simulations, or promote detonation failure by creating
strong expansion waves behind decaying shock in 1D.

6.4. Detonation diffraction

At an abrupt area change, detonation diffraction occurs and can lead
to quenching or re-initiation. Since the pioneering work of Zeldovich
et al. [738] the detonation diffraction phenomenon has received exten-
sive attention and has been investigated through experimental, theo-
retical, and numerical works. The detonation diffraction phenomenon
is relevant to a number of fundamental aspects, such as detonation
propagation in porous media [586], and practical applications, such
as industrial safety, and detonative propulsion [758]. A comprehensive
review on detonation diffraction has been provided by Schultz [759]
and include the relevant literature up to 2000. More recent studies
up to 2017, in particular those focusing on numerical simulations
of detonation, have been summarized in Gallier et al. [624]. In the
following, focus is brought on the most recent papers on detonation
diffraction but also recall some important results obtained in more
ancient studies.

6.4.1. Regimes of detonation diffraction

Detonation diffraction is observed when a detonation propagates
from a confined environment (tube, or square or rectangular channel)
into an unconfined environment. When the detonation exits the tube,
expansion waves are created at the corner of the tube and influence
the transmission of the detonation to the open space. The diffraction
process induces a change of geometry from an essentially planar to
a cylindrical or spherical wave. The outcome of a diffraction event
is influenced by a large number of parameters such as the mixture
composition, the initial thermodynamic conditions, the geometrical
characteristics of the area expansion, and the channel characteristic
length-scale [586,759–761]. The detonation diffraction process has
three possible outcomes: (i) the sub-critical outcome; (ii) the critical
outcome; and (iii) the super-critical outcome. Fig. 103 top shows an
example of a sub-critical outcome during detonation diffraction. Under
such conditions, the shock front and the reaction zone progressively
decouple due to the increased curvature and the action of the expan-
sion waves. The trajectory of the intersection of the expansion waves
with the detonation front can be described as a line which extends
between the corner of the channel and the channel axis. The expansion
waves induce an isentropic expansion of the fluid parcels within the
reaction zone. This results in the weakening of the transverse waves,
the increase of the local cell size and eventually, in the decoupling of
the shock front and the reaction zone. No re-initiation is taking place
and the detonation is quenched. The shock wave velocity progressively
drops whereas chemical activity within the reaction zone is essentially
frozen. Fig. 103 middle shows an example of a near-critical outcome
during detonation diffraction. Under such conditions, the shock front
and the reaction zone also progressively decouple. Nevertheless, local
re-initiation is taking place somewhere between the shock and the
reaction zone and a transverse detonation is propagating preferentially
within the shocked but unreacted gas layer formed by the decoupling
of the shock and the reaction zone. Fig. 103 bottom shows an example
of a super-critical outcome during detonation diffraction. Under such
conditions, full decoupling of the shock and the reaction zone is not
taking place and re-initiation occurs after a shorter time, as compared
to the near-critical case. As pressure is further increased, the detonation
would be less and less affected by the diffraction process.

6.4.2. Characteristic length-scale of detonation diffraction
6.4.2.1. Critical tube diameter. The critical tube diameter (dc ) corre-
sponds to the minimal tube diameter for which detonation re-initiation
takes place. For smaller diameter, detonation quenching is observed.
It depends strongly on the mixture composition and on the initial
pressure. Table 11 gives some typical critical diameter values for
hydrogen–air mixtures at near-ambient conditions. All these data were
taken from the study of Guirao et al. [643]. Although detonation
diffraction has been extensively studied, there is only limited number
of data available in the literature. This is because most studies focus

on the determination of the critical pressure for successful detonation
transmission to open space, rather than on the determination of the
critical tube diameter. The former approach is more easily applied than
the latter, since only the initial pressure needs to be modified, while the
experimental arrangement is fixed. From the data of Guirao et al. [643],
it can be seen that the critical tube diameter is relatively large for H2-
air mixtures. At Φ=1, it is around 200 mm, while it increases to more
than one meter for lean and rich mixtures. It should be noted however,
that pipes with such diameters might not be so uncommon in industrial
settings.

The critical tube diameter has been correlated with the cell width.
For irregular mixtures, the critical tube diameter to the cell width
ratio (dc /λ) is equal to 13 [586], while it can reach 20–30 for reg-
ular mixtures [633]. Ciccarelli [763] showed that for hydrogen–air
mixtures, dc/λ ranged from 18 to 24. Plaster et al. [764] found that
dc was smaller under cryogenic conditions. The critical length (lc )
for successful diffraction strongly depends on the geometry of the
channel [586]. For a rectangular channel with a large aspect ratio, the
correlation is lc /λ=3.

Several approaches can be employed to predict the critical tube
diameter. Following the findings of Eckett et al. [264] on DDI, Schultz
[759] proposed that detonation quenching during diffraction is due to
unsteadiness and established the CDR model for detonation diffraction.
This model typically predicts the critical tube diameter with satisfactory
accuracy, i.e. within a factor of 2–3, for H2-O2(-diluent) mixtures,
However, the results for some hydrogen–air mixtures might be largely
over-estimated, i.e., up to approximately 20 times. More recently, Rad-
ulescu et al. [765,766] established a model to predict the detonation
quenching for 2D channels. This model combined geometric shock
dynamics and the shock change equation to describe the dynamical
response of the detonation front to the expansion wave originating
from the corner of the channel. Prediction of the critical tube diameter
obtained experimentally within 40% and obtained numerically within
10% could be achieved. Comparison with other similar models showed
that the model of Radulescu et al. performed significantly better.

6.4.2.2. Re-initiation and wall reflection distances.
In the past 10 years,
some authors have proposed to characterize the detonation diffrac-
tion process using different length-scale than the critical tube diame-
ter [767,768]. They defined two new length-scale: (i) the re-initiation
distance, which corresponds to the distance between the corner of
the channel and the point at which re-initiation of the diffracting
detonation is taking place; and (ii) the wall reflection distance, which
corresponds to the distance between the corner of the channel and
the point at which transverse detonation initiated during diffraction
reflects at the wall. Fig. 104 illustrates the definition of the wall
reflection distance. While the early study focused on hydrocarbon
fuels [767], the most recent one [768] also employed hydrogen–oxygen
mixtures. For all the mixtures tested, the ratio reflection wall distance
to channel width was in the range 3.8 ± 0.8. The advantage of this
latter length-scale is that it seems independent of the regularity of the
mixture.

Yuan et al. [769] established a semi-analytical model to predict
the wall reflection distance. For regular hydrogen-based mixtures, they
noted that (i) for large deviation angles, the re-initiation location can
be theoretically predicted; (ii) the velocity of the transverse wave is
close to DCJ; and (iii) the shape of the decoupled shock front can
be adequately predicted by the Chester–Chisnell–Whitham theory. The
authors employed these characteristics to build their model and found
satisfactory agreement when comparing with the 2D numerical simula-
tions and the experimental results of Nagura et al. [767]. It should be
noted that Radulescu [770] reported that an erroneous equation was
used by Yuan et al. to calculate the rate of change of the surface area
of the diffracting shock. Corrected results were provided in [771] and
demonstrated a slight deterioration of the agreement with the reference
data.

6.4.3. Various cases of detonation diffraction

Detonation diffraction can take place in a wide variety of config-
urations. In particular, the re-initiation process can be significantly
influenced by the conditions of the reactive mixture and by the ge-
ometry downstream of the channel expansion. In the following, we
review different cases which have been studied either experimentally
or numerically over the past 20 years or so.

6.4.3.1. Classical diffraction scenarios.
In this section, we focus on the
studies in which the influence of side or front walls is unimportant in
the re-initiation process following detonation diffraction. In most stud-
ies, the expansion wall is located at 90◦, and spontaneous re-initiation
events could take place or not, leading to successful or unsuccessful
detonation transmission.

All the recent studies performed on detonation diffraction consid-
ered weakly unstable cases. As shown in Fig. 105, Gallier et al. [624]
obtained overall qualitative agreement with the OH-PLIF and OH∗
chemiluminescence experiments from Pintgen’s studies [761,772]. On
the other, the experimental critical pressure for transition from unsuc-
cessful to successful outcome could not be accurately reproduce in the
simulations. This result is consistent with the study of Deiterding [773]
who reported a critical channel height of Hc = 10λ. This value appears
to agree well with the experimental value for square channels [586],
but not with the typical value obtained for diffraction from a cylindrical
tube. This feature was attributed to the difference of geometry, cylin-
drical in the simulations against spherical in the experiments, which
significantly modifies the rate of expansion during diffraction [624].
Shi et al. [774] focused their study on the re-initiation mechanism
of planar and cellular detonation. Consistent with previous studies,
they found that detonation re-initiation is promoted by the cellular
structure. For the planar detonation, the authors found that the re-
initiation process was driven by the amplification of a pressure wave
formed in the far field. For the cellular detonation, they observed that
detonation re-initiation was achieved by the formation of a number of
local hot spots by multiple transverse wave collisions.

The configuration used by Yuan et al. [775] appears slightly differ-
ent since they considered smooth bended corners and not sharp ones
as in the studies presented above. Because of the smooth turning of
the wall, the area divergence is less strong than for a sharp corner.
This results in a delay and less important decoupling of the shock and
reaction zone along the wall. Re-initiation by a transverse detonation
rapidly takes place if the initial pressure is high enough. They also
showed that a larger radius of curvature is less efficient at inducing
shock-reaction zone decoupling. Comparisons with a theoretical model
based on the Chester–Chisnell–Whitham theory and the quasi-steady
detonation model demonstrate reasonable agreement.

6.4.3.2. Diffraction with shock reflection induced re-initiation. Re-initia-
tion of a diffracted detonation at a backward-facing step by shock
reflection at the side wall was also studied experimentally by Ohyagi
et al. [776] and numerically by Lv and Ihme [777], see Fig. 106.
Under super-critical conditions, the diffraction process does not cause
global extinction of the detonation and the reflection at the bottom wall
is unimportant. Under near-critical conditions, the decoupled shock
interacts with the bottom wall, which induces re-initiation. Under sub-
critical conditions, the shock reflection at the wall does not lead to a
re-initiation event. The numerical study showed that, depending on the
reactivity of the mixture, re-initiation can take place behind a regular
shock reflection through the SWACER mechanism, or behind a Mach
reflection through flame-acoustic and wave-wave interactions. It was
also found that viscous effects can promote detonation initiation.

Another configuration for which shock reflection is important for
the re-initiation process corresponds to detonation diffraction at a T-
branched channel. Guo et al. [778] and Wang et al. [779] pointed
out that since transverse waves and curved fronts are generated under
this configuration, the situation is more complex than when sponta-
neous detonation re-initiation is taking place. The detonation front gets

curved by the presence of the T-shape. Because of the angle between
the leading shock wave and the bottom wall located after the T, a Mach
reflection is formed for the portion of the detonation transmitted to the
straight part of the channel. The classical detonation structure is re-
established after a distance. The portion of the detonation propagating
in the vertical tube undergoes strong expansion and the shock and
reaction zone get decoupled. Detonation re-initiation takes place as the
diffracted shock reflects off the right corner and wall of the T-junction,
which leads to the formation of a transverse detonation propagating
in the region of shocked gas between the shock and reaction zone.
Eventually, a classical cellular structure is also re-established in the
bottom tube and the detonation is propagating downward. At very
low pressure, the detonation may be successfully transmitted to the

horizontal part of the T-junction, but fails in the vertical part. A similar
study was more recently performed by Heidari and Wen [780] and
further pointed out the important role for detonation re-initiation of
the collision of the diffracted shock at the wall in the vertical tube.

Wakita et al. [781] and Mikhalkin et al. [782] evaluated the pos-
sibility of using a reflection board in front of a diffracting detonation
to ensure detonation transmission. They demonstrated the existence of
an optimum distance between the tube exit and the reflection board
for promoting re-initiation. The authors identified two mechanisms
for successful detonation transmission: (i) if the detonation does not
completely fail before the board, re-initiation can take place by shock
reflection against the board; and (ii) if the detonation has completely

failed, the interaction of the shock wave with the reflecting board cre-
ates a torus-like pressure wave which induces re-initiation downstream
of the board.

6.4.3.3. Diffraction in bended tube. Several authors have studied the
propagation of detonation in hydrogen-based mixtures in smooth ben-
ded pipes and investigated the effects of several parameters.

Deiterding [773], Li et al. [783], and Yuan et al. [784], employed
a similar configuration consisting of two parallel bended walls. Diffrac-
tion is taking place along the diverging wall, while shock reflection
occurs along the converging wall. An increase of the cell size and
cell irregularity, as well as shock-reaction zone decoupling are taking
place in the diffracted region, while a re-initiation wave is formed
in the successfully transmitted region and propagates as a transverse
detonation within the decoupled region. Li et al. [783] varied the bend
angle from 30 to 90◦, see one simulation example in Fig. 107, and
observed that a larger angle affects more the detonation propagation.
Following the re-initiation of the detonation by the strong transverse
detonation, a longer distance downstream of the bend is required to
re-establish the steady detonation propagation dynamics when a larger
angle is considered. Yuan et al. [784] more closely focused on the
evolution of the regularity of the detonation wave as it propagates
through a 90◦ bend, and they identified the critical conditions for the
transition between stable and unstable structures. They also studied the
effect of the radius of curvature of the bended tube and found that
this parameter has a significant impact on the characteristics of the
diffraction process and the re-initiation of the transverse detonation
wave.

The dynamics of detonation propagation in bended channel is also
relevant to RDE applications, for which the combustion chamber cor-
responds to an annular channel. Several studies have considered a
U-shape configuration and performed numerical simulations. Melguizo-
Gavilanes et al. [758] investigated the dynamics of a detonation in a
semi-hollow channel; the internal wall of the combustor is partially
removed so that the detonation is propagating in a channel of increas-
ing width. They distinguished two phases during the propagation: (i)
The front first diffracts and then a transverse detonation consumes
the unreacted shocked gas, re-establishing the detonation over the full
width of the channel. Finally, a reactive Mach stem is formed at the
outer wall; (ii) A larger part of the detonation front at the inner wall
is affected by diffraction. The interaction of the Mach detonation with
the unreacted gas results in the formation of a s-shaped structure, and
a strong transverse detonation finally consumes the large pocket of
unreacted shocked gas. Zhang et al. [785] considered a simple U-shape

tions were performed with detailed chemistry and a stoichiometric H2/O2 mixture.

channel with a constant width. They proposed that the propagation
of detonation in an annular channel can be classified according to six
modes, depending on whether the detonation is stable, i.e., no decou-
pling is taking place, or unstable, i.e., local decoupling is taking place,
and on the dynamics of the Mach stem at the outer wall, i.e., growing,
steady, or decaying.

6.4.3.4. Diffraction over obstacles. Diffraction over obstacles has been
studied by several authors [786–788]. Yang et al. [786] and Shi
et al. [787] employed relatively similar configurations with the det-
onation interacting successively with the convex and concave parts of
a cylindrical obstacle. Regular and then Mach reflection occur as the
detonation wave interacts with the convex part of the half-cylinder. As
the detonation propagates over the diverging part of the obstacle, it
undergoes diffraction, which can lead to the decoupling of the shock
front and reaction zone and eventually to detonation failure. In the

stoichiometric H2-O2 mixture initially at 20 kPa and 300 K. Quasi-
detonations with various velocity deficits and irregularity levels were
established by placing fence-like obstacles of different heights along the
bottom wall. In general, quasi-detonation were found to be more easily
transmitted to open-space. Because of the high irregularity of the quasi-
detonation, the authors observed that the outcome, re-initiation or
failure, of the diffraction process demonstrates important stochasticity.
They showed that the probability of successful transmission increases
up to a given obstacle’s height. They attributed this feature to the
increased instability of the quasi-detonation as the obstacle height
increases. Beyond a critical length, the probability was observed to
decrease again, which was attributed to a too important velocity deficit.

6.4.3.7. Other diffraction studies. Qu et al. [792] studied detonation
propagation in diverging and converging channels using a detailed
chemical model for a H2-O2-Ar mixture. They observed that, as the
initially regular multi-headed cellular structure propagates passed the
area expansion, it becomes irregular. The cell width progressively
increases due to the corner expansion, until only one cell remains
and a significant portion of the shock front gets decoupled from the
reaction zone. Re-initiation is taking place through a strong transverse
detonation. It originates from the location at which the channel height
stops increasing and leads to the formation of a band of very small cells
in the decoupled region. The regular structure is eventually recovered
after some distance. The authors also noted that detonation diffraction
also occurs in the case of the converging channel; as the decrease of the
area stops, an expansion wave is generated at the corner and affects the
detonation structure.

Yuan et al. [793] studied the transmission to open-space of a det-
onation propagating in a bended tube. The detonation response to the
bend creates a curved detonation front, especially for small radius of
curvature in the bend. Successful transmission to open-space is favored
for the detonation propagating in the bended channel as compared
to the case with propagation in a straight tube. This behavior was
attributed to the formation of an asymmetric detonation front with a
Mach stem at the outer wall. This Mach stem can better resist the expan-
sion during transmission to open-space and favors re-initiation through
the formation of a transverse detonation. The process of diffraction
of the detonation wave following propagation in a bended channel is
shown in Fig. 109.

Xiao et al. [794] proposed a novel approach to analyze the dynamics
of the diverging front during diffraction. As illustrated in Fig. 110, the
method combines the forward and backward ray tracking approaches,
so that the ray is perpendicular to two successive detonation fronts.
Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results were employed to val-
idate this approach, which is well suited to study the diffracting front
dynamics away from the symmetry axis. The authors employed this
method to analysis the velocity–curvature relations at several locations
along the curved front and found that the resulting curves closely agree
with the predictions of the generalized ZND model.

For completeness, we note that other configurations can also lead to
detonation diffraction. For example, the transmission of a detonation
to a weaker explosive mixture in a layered configuration can lead to
detonation failure and subsequent re-initiation by shock reflection at
the bottom wall. This configuration was studied in the 1990’s, for
example by Jones et al. [795].

6.5. Non-ideal effects

6.5.1. Real-gas effects

While Ng et al. [636] estimated the detonation cell size of hydrogen–
air mixtures at pressure up to 1 MPa, all their calculations relied
on the ideal gas assumption. Above a certain pressure threshold, the
attractive and repulsive forces between the atoms and molecules can
significantly influence the thermo-dynamic state of the gas and modify
the combustion characteristics of reactive mixtures. Such effects are

study of Yang et al. [786], the curved diffracted shock then reflects at
the bottom wall, and possibly, detonation may be re-initiated. If total
decoupling has taken place before reflection, a DDT event triggered
by a Mach reflection with formation of a strong transverse detonation
was observed. If total decoupling has taken place before reflection,
the detonation was re-initiated upon reflection and no transverse
detonation was observed. The configuration used by Wang et al. [788]
was different; flat edge of the semi-circular obstacle placed on the way
of the detonation propagation; to ensure no shock reflection would
take place before diffraction. The studies of Shi et al. [787] and Wang
et al. [788] demonstrated that the angle at which decoupling is taking
place is very sensitive to the size of the obstacle, which can lead to
sub-, near-, and super-critical outcomes as the size of the obstacle was
increased. In other words, the smaller obstacles proved less efficient at
quenching detonation than the large ones. The cylindrical obstacles are
the most efficient to trigger detonation re-initiation.

6.4.3.5. Diffraction in flowing mixture. While most studies on deto-
nation diffraction have considered transmission to open-space into a
medium at rest, some investigations have been carried out for trans-
mission into flowing reactive mixtures [789,790]. The flow velocity in
the open-space was varied from 0 to Mach 4. The diffraction processes
in a mixture at rest and in a flowing mixture are shown in Fig. 108.
The expansion region at the upstream corner is transformed into a
compression region by the incoming flow, while the expansion at the
downstream corner is enhanced. For fast enough lateral flow, failure
at the left/right corner is prevented/promoted. Re-initiation on the
downstream side of the horizontal channel may eventually occur after
multiple reflection off the lateral walls. The promoting effect is less
important for unstable mixtures.

6.4.3.6. Diffraction of quasi-detonation. Recognizing that previous stud-
ies have focused on the diffraction of CJ detonation, Yan et al. [791]
studied the diffraction of quasi-detonation through numerical simula-
tions performed with a two-step reaction model representative of a

across the front is lower than expected from theory and attributed
this difference to an incomplete rotational relaxation of oxygen and
hydrogen. Manzhalei et al. [638] measured the detonation cell width
at high initial pressures, i.e., up to 1 Mpa, for several reactive mixtures
including H2-O2 mixtures. They reported that no qualitative change
could be detected in term of regularity of the cellular structure. The
most comprehensive study on RG effects on detonation properties was
performed at the CNRS in Poitiers by Bauer et al. [800–802]. The
investigations were performed for a variety of fuels including H2 with
and without N2 dilution and were performed over the range of pressure
0.2–3 MPa. The detonation velocity and the cell width were studied.

The complexification of the Euler equations as RG EoS and thermo-
dynamics are taken into account has limited the utilization of theory
to study the RG effects on detonation. Schall [803] extended the CJ
theory by considering the effect of the finite molecular volume using
the Noble-Abel (NA) EoS. The results indicate that the velocity is
higher for a NA gas than for a perfect gas, which enables a better
agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the pressure at the
CJ state is lower and the specific volume is higher for a Noble-Abel
gas. Costa and Gonzáles [804] studied both the effects of the finite
volume and of the molecular attraction by using the van der Walls
(vdW) EoS. The nonideal RG effects on the thermodynamic functions
and parameters were also considered. Although, the dominant RG effect
is due to the molecular volume, they reported that the prediction of
the detonation velocity is in better agreement with the experimental
data when the vdW EoS is used instead of the NA EoS. Recent work by
Radulescu [805] provides a number of relevant theoretical results in
the framework of the Noble-Abel stiffened gas EoS. Weng et al. [806]
extended the CDR theory to NA and vdW EoS and showed the critical
decay rate of the leading shock can be modified by up to two orders of
magnitude under certain conditions.

Several numerical studies have focused on the impact of RG effects
on the detonation properties, i.e., mainly the CJ state and the detona-
tion velocity. Astapov et al. [807] developed a numerical framework
to calculate the detonation properties using both the perfect gas and
vdW EoS. They varied the initial temperature between 80 and 1000 K,
the initial pressure between 0.01 and 100 MPa, and the hydrogen
mole fraction between 0.0956 and 0.91. Differences between the initial
state densities for the perfect gas and the van der Waals gas become
significant for an initial pressure of 200 kPa. Concerning the CJ state,
differences start to be noticeable for initial pressure between 20 and
50 MPa, depending on which parameter is considered. Comparing the
measured and calculated detonation velocities, it is observed that using
the perfect gas EoS leads to an under-estimation of the velocity whereas
using the van der Waals equation enables an accurate prediction of
the velocity. Schmitt and Butler [808] extended the work of Astapov
et al. to several other cubic EoS including vdW, Redlich-Kwong (RK),
Soave, and Peng–Robinson (PR). They compared the detonation veloc-
ity predicted using these EoS to the data obtained by Bauer [800]. It
was shown that the agreement between the experimental and theoret-
ical speeds is much better when using an EoS for real gas. The best
agreement was observed when considering either the Soave–Redlich–
Kwong or the Peng–Robinson EoS. They also showed that, at high initial
pressure, the perfect gas and van der Waals EoS respectively lead to an
under-estimation and an over-estimation of the CJ velocity. Noticeable
differences between the experimental velocity and the one predicted
using the perfect gas equation were observed for initial pressure above
1 MPa.

In addition to the study of the RG effects on the detonation prop-
erties, a number of papers have investigated their impact on the det-
onation structure. Schmitt and Butler [809] studied the effect of the
EoS on the ZND structure by considering both the perfect gas and the
Redlich-Kwong EoS. Significant differences between the calculations
appear for an initial pressure as low as 1 MPa. At 10 MPa, the induction
zone length is 2.5 times larger when using the RK EoS. The difference
between the two calculations decreases as the initial temperature is

usually referred to as real gas (RG) effects and have been shown to be
of primary importance for detonation under high-pressure conditions. It
is noted that accounting for RG effects requires to modify the equation
of state (EoS), the thermodynamic functions and properties, as well as
the chemical kinetics equation, i.e., the mass-action law. Experiment,
theory, and simulation were employed to study the RG effects on
detonation.

Experimental data on detonation obtained at initial pressure higher
than 0.1 MPa are rather scarce [796]. Gealer and Churchill [797]
measured the detonation velocity up to 7 MPa for hydrogen–oxygen
mixtures containing between 40 and 80% H2. At such a high initial
pressure, they noted that the experimental velocity was 2% higher
than the theoretical velocity. Duff [798] employed the side- and end-
wall soot foil technique to study the detonation stability and spinning
detonation at initial pressure as high as 200 kPa. It was noted that the
detonation instability persists even at high initial pressure. Levitt and
Honig [799] studied the structure of detonation in a lean hydrogen–
oxygen mixture, i.e., Φ = 0.1667, at initial pressure in the range
140–280 kPa. They employed the optical reflectivity technique and
showed that the detonation fronts are similar to normal shock in
terms of thickness and planarity. They noted that the density jump

increased because the real-gas effect become less pronounced. For both
the perfect gas and the Redlich-Kwong gas, a U-shape curve is observed
for the evolution of the induction zone length as a function of hydrogen
content. The induction zone length is always larger when using the
real-gas equation of state. Weng and Mevel [810] extended the work of
Schmitt and Butler [809] in two directions: (i) they employed the PR
EoS; and (ii) they investigated the impact induced by the modification
of the mass-action law. When including both the compressibility factor
and the fugacity coefficient in the calculations of the reaction rate,
the induction zone length can become even shorter in a RG than
in a perfect gas. They also performed an uncertainty quantification
study and showed that: (i) at high-pressure, the uncertainty induced
by the uncertainty on the RG model parameters is comparable to the
uncertainty induced by the uncertainty on the reaction rate constants;
and (ii) the species inducing the highest uncertainty corresponds to
the one with the largest mole fraction weighted molecular attraction
and covolume parameters. Taileb et al. [796] performed the first study
on the effect of RG on the 2D cellular structure of detonation. They
employed the Noble-Abel EoS, which considers only the effect of finite
molecular volume, and described the chemical kinetics using a 1-step
irreversible Arrhenius law. They observed that, for the same initial con-
ditions, the detonation cellular structure is significantly more regular in
a Noble-Abel gas than in a perfect gas. These observations were recently
confirmed by Weng and Mével [811]. Taileb et al. attributed the higher
irregularity observed for a perfect gas to forward jets formed during
Mach reflection. Such a phenomenon, which is illustrated in Fig. 111,
creates a shear layer which interacts with a triple point moving in the
opposite direction and leads to a more irregular Mach topology. In line
with previous results [812], the importance of the effective isentropic
coefficient in the dynamics of the detonation front has been pointed
out by Taileb et al. [796]; the higher effective isentropic coefficient for
a Noble-Abel gas leads to a more regular detonation front. The effect
of the co-volume on detonation stability was further studied by Weng
and Mevel [813] using linear stability analysis and high-resolution
simulation of 1D pulsating detonation.

6.5.2. Vibrational non-equilibrium effects

Following shock compression by the leading shock of the detona-
tion, translational equilibrium is achieved after 10 collisions whereas
rotational equilibrium is achieved after 10 to 20 collisions for most
small molecules except H2, which requires approximately 300 colli-
sions. Thus, rapid equilibrium is established between the translational

and rotational modes of energy. On the other hand, it takes thousands
of collisions for vibrational modes of energy to reach thermal equilib-
rium [814]. Such a thermal non-equilibrium can significantly affect the
rate of chemical reactions and pioneering work on the effect of thermal
non-equilibrium on detonation was performed by Tarver in the early
1980’s [815,816]. In addition, linear and non-linear stability analyses
by Uy et al. [817,818] have shown that thermal non-equilibrium had a
stabilizing effect and should lead to more regular detonation structure.
Taylor et al. [814], compared the detonation cell width measured
experimentally and calculated using high-resolution 2D numerical sim-
ulation with detailed chemistry for H2-O2-Ar and H2-air mixtures.
For the mixtures with Ar-dilution, a discrepancy of a factor of two
was observed, whereas for the H2-air mixture, a discrepancy as high
as a factor of four was reported. Taylor et al. also noticed that the
experimental cellular patterns for H2-air mixtures were much more
regular than the ones obtained numerically. They argued that such
discrepancies could be mainly attributed to vibrational non-equilibrium
and compared the characteristic time for vibrational relaxation to the
ignition delay-time. For a wide range of detonation-relevant conditions,
the ignition delay-time is less than 10 times the relaxation time for H2,
which could influence the ignition process.

The results of Taylor et al. have motivated more detailed studies
by Shi et al. [667], and Voelkel et al. [819] who performed 2D
numerical simulations of detonation under thermal equilibrium and
non-equilibrium conditions. The results obtained by Shi et al. [667],
and Voelkel et al. [819] are consistent with each other and show that
the cell width is significantly increased, by approximately 70 to 100%,
when thermal non-equilibrium is accounted for through a two- or multi-
temperature model. Fig. 112 presents the translational–rotational and
vibrational temperature fields calculated by Voelkel et al. [819] and
clearly shows that a significant distance is required to populate the
higher vibrational energy levels of H2, while those of O2 very rapidly
equilibrate.

While accounting for thermal non-equilibrium using a two- or multi-
temperature model constitutes a significant improvement over the uti-
lization of a thermal equilibrium model, such a model corresponds
to a very simplified approach and other authors have recently at-
tempted to employ a state-to-state modeling approach. In the vibra-
tionally resolved state-to-state approach, all possible vibrational levels
of molecules are considered and treated separately. The different en-
ergy transfers as well as the chemical reactions are included in the
reaction mechanism, which typically leads to extremely large reaction

models. Kadochnikov and Arsentiev [820] developed a STS model
which includes vibrational non-equilibrium for N2, O2, H2, and OH.
They showed that the extent of vibrational non-equilibrium increases
with the shock wave strength, which can significantly delay ignition
at high Mach number of the leading shock. Under the conditions they
selected, the distributions of vibrational energy levels were close to
Boltzmann ones, which implies that the use of a 2-temperature model
of the Park type can provide reasonably accurate results, as long as
the parameters of such a reduced-order model are adequately refined,
for example based on QCT results. More recently, Vargas et al. [821]
included STS models for N2 and O2 to simulate steady detonation in
H2-air mixtures. Their model includes 113 mass conservation equations
and 10150 elementary reactions. Although their STS description is
not complete, they showed that: (i) the induction zone is essentially
endothermic, and not thermally neutral as when considering thermal
equilibrium [586]; (ii) depending on which assumptions are used to
build the STS model, an increase of the induction zone length by up
to an order of magnitude can be observed; (iii) the distribution of O2
and N2 vibrational energies can be highly non-Bolztmanian behind the
shock front, which cannot be captured by a 2-temperature model; and
(iv) a STS framework has a good potential to provide a more accurate
detonation modeling.

6.6. Summary on detonation studies

As for FA and DDT, quite a large number of studies have been
performed over the past 15–20 years on various aspects of detonation

wave. In particular, detonation diffraction has received considerable
attention, probably because of its great significance for rotating detona-
tion engine whose most common design relies on the use of an annular
combustion chamber. It is also noted that the continuous increase of
computational power has enabled the flourishment of numerical studies
in which detailed chemistry is employed [622,624,732,754,773,777,
785]. Despite these efforts, it should be noted that many studies are
rather incremental or essentially repeated work. Nevertheless, several
research highlights should be pointed out.

One area for which important improvements have been made for
the study of detonation wave corresponds to the LIF technique and
associated results. Detailed modeling of the LIF process for OH rad-
icals [622,624,626] has enabled to correctly interpret the seminal
images from Austin [620] and Pintgen et al. [619], and have shown that
strong incident laser light absorption at the front makes impossible the
observation of OH radical away from the front if strong absorption lines
are employed. This insight has led to the implementation of excitation
schemes more adapted to detonation conditions, which do not suffer
from such a limitation and enable to visualize regions of high OH con-
centration at a large distance behind the front [627]. The most recent
application of the LIF technique at shorter wavelength along with NO-
seeding [629,630] is particularly promising since this approach enables
to measure the induction zone length of detonation wave, and paves
the way for quantitative validation of numerical simulations and for the
development of accurate detailed reaction model, specifically validated

and optimized for detonation conditions. Such quantitative detonation-
specific diagnostics have been missing for too long and efforts should be
made to further develop such capabilities to improve our understanding
of detonation wave structure and dynamics.

Another important improvement over the past 15–20 years cor-
responds to the detailed investigation of detonation propagation in
mixtures with transverse concentration gradients [668,669,671–673].
Such a configuration is more likely to be encountered in real accidental
events. It was shown that the shock front curvature induced by the
gradient can lead to the formation of a detonation Mach reflection that
generates much higher over-pressure than a detonation propagating in
a uniform mixture of equivalent average composition.

The large number of studies [571,674–683,791] performed on the
dynamics of quasi-detonation should also be pointed out due to their
strong implication for safety. Indeed, in practical scenario, it is likely
that an accidental detonation is initiated and propagates in a highly
congested area. A variety of experimental configurations for the ob-
stacles were employed including orifice plates, fence-like, and bank
of cylindrical obstacles. The comprehensive studies performed with
fence-like obstacles have enabled to identify a discontinuous regime
of near-limit quasi-detonation propagation with symmetric and non-
symmetric modes. For the non-symmetric mode, the initiation of the
detonation is taking place alternatively behind the top and the bottom
obstacle, which leads to a ‘‘zig-zag’’ propagation. While most recent
results on quasi-detonation are consistent with the seminal results of
Peraldi et al. [539], some discrepancies were also observed for specific
configurations. For instance, detonation failure could be observed in
some cases, even for an open diameter larger than 13λ. It is noted that
only few numerical studies [791] were performed on quasi-detonation
and future work should attempt to close this gap and obtain comple-
mentary results to allow for a better understanding of the dynamics of
quasi-detonation.

The study of non-ideal effects, including real gas effects and vibra-
tional non-equilibrium, has also been an important aspect of research
on detonation within the past 10 years. Concerning the real gas effects,
it should be noted that, depending on the exact real gas model em-
ployed, either an increase or a decrease of the induction zone length is
predicted [810]. The first two-dimensional numerical study performed
with a real gas model [796] has shown that the regularity of the
cellular structure can be strongly enhanced at high pressure due to the
increase of the isentropic coefficient induced by the finite molecular
volume. This latter aspect potentially has important implications for
safety since stable detonation are usually easier to quench. Further
investigation of real gas effects on multi-dimensional detonation is still
needed to complement the existing studies based on steady detonation
simulations or unsteady simulations relying on simple RG models. The
effect of vibrational non-equilibrium has been studied using simple
two- or multi-temperature [814,814,819] and more complex state-to-
state [820,821] vibrational non-equilibrium models. All these studies
converged toward the conclusion that vibrational non-equilibrium in-
duces a significant increase of the induction zone length, which could
explain, at least partly, the discrepancies between the numerical and
experimental cell widths. In addition, linear and non-linear stability
analyses [817,818] indicate that thermal non-equilibrium tends to
stabilize detonation. Experimental determination of the actual extent
of thermal non-equilibrium in detonation, and incorporation of more
comprehensive models in multi-dimensional simulation would further
improve the current understanding of the detonation community on
this aspect.

7. Concluding remarks and recommendations for future work

Hydrogen has a key role to play in the global transition to Net Zero.
This leads to increasing demand for hydrogen safety to be addressed
across its entire value chain from production, transport, distribution
to utilization. The paper starts with an overview of the risk analysis

framework with consideration that this traditional industrial gas will
come into proximity of the untrained public. The need for contin-
uous development and update of the RCS is highlighted although
detailed discussion around this topic is outside the scope of this re-
view. However, some of the pre-normative research which directly
addresses large-scale applications to inform industrial practices and
RCS are discussed here. It is also noted that most results obtained
worldwide in this context have been incorporated into the open source
HyRAM [44,45,54] risk analysis framework, enabling easy use by prac-
titioners, researchers and students. In the following, key achievements
and the associated knowledge gaps are summarized for the various
topics covered in this review.

7.1. Ignition

With regards to ignition, the review divided the bulk amounts of
literature into two main categories, i.e., unforced and forced ignition.
Unforced ignition phenomena include shock ignition, spontaneous
ignition, and other specific ignition events. Previous research has iden-
tified the very important role of reflected shock ignition in the process
of detonation onset in obstructed environment and for quasi-detonation
propagation. The spontaneous ignition of hydrogen has been exten-
sively investigated experimentally and numerically, indicating such an
event is a valid scenario for releases through a section of a tube.
Direct quantitative comparison between the earlier numerical studies
with the few recent more detailed experiments have not been reported
due to the differences in initial pressure and geometric conditions.
This hinders the application of the published numerical approaches to
address some fresh experimental observation in large-scale tests, for
which, detailed diagnostics or measurements are not possible. Quanti-
tative comparison with experiments involving detailed laser diagnostics
will be useful under the same initial pressure and geometric condi-
tions. These should be conducted with adequate grid resolutions to
minimize ignition due to numerical diffusion. Quantification valida-
tion will be essential to facilitate the application of the published
numerical approaches to address some fresh experimental observation
in large-scale tests. Potentially validated predictive tools can also be
used to generate ignition probabilities. Few published investigations
about ignition by water hammer were identified as well as some
scenarios for cavitation-induced ignition. The importance of the com-
petition between expansion and chemical kinetics for water hammer
ignition was pointed. While some possible mechanisms were discussed
for cavitation-induced ignition, there are insufficient results to guide
concluding comments. Further experimental investigations will be use-
ful to enable a clearer understanding the possible mechanisms about
cavitation-induced ignition.

Forced ignition phenomena include hot surface and spark ignition.
Ignition by hot surface of various shapes has been extensively studied
experimentally, theoretically, and numerically revealing the controlling
parameters identified. Most studies indicated that ignition by a hot
surface is preferentially taking place at stagnation and flow separation
points. This topic has been generally well addressed experimentally and
numerical simulations under atmospheric or near-atmospheric pressure
conditions. A few outstanding issues remain to be tackled: (1) data and
analytical investigations under high-pressure conditions are lacking.
This could be relevant to applications like hydrogen storage systems;
(2) relatively little is known about ignition in compositions close to
the low flammability limit and evolution from ‘‘puff’’ to flame, and
potential effect of turbulence in the vicinity of the hot surface.

Spark ignition has also been widely studied experimentally and
numerically, with the dynamics of the complex process being well
understood for both non-reactive and reactive mixtures. The important
role of the transition from the initial plasma kernel (often cylindrical)
into a region of high-temperature gas (often toroidal) is well recognized
with the influencing parameters identified as the spark energy, the

101

geometry of the electrode, the electrode spacing, the mixture composi-
tion, the velocity of the fresh mixture, etc. The MIE has been extensively
measured over wide ranges of conditions of atmospheric temperature.
Nevertheless, more data are required in the lower temperature ranges,
including cryogenic conditions as well as temperatures at high alti-
tudes, which are relevant to the operation as well as safety of hydrogen
fueled combustion systems for aircraft propulsion.

7.2. Jet fires

Most previous research on hydrogen gas jet flames were conducted
for open configurations while some limited studies examined hydrogen
jet fires in enclosures. The published investigations have mostly focused
on the safety related global features like flame length, shape and
radiative fractions. Detailed studies are lacking in the open literature
about some fine features of the flame structure and flame stabilization
in large-scale jet fires, in which rich and lean premixed flames as well
as diffusion flame islands might co-exist to influence flame stabiliza-
tion, which has safety implications with potential built up of unburnt
flammable mixtures in relatively hot environments. Results are also
lacking in the public domain for either experimental or CFD results for
impinging jet fires. Experimental and numerical investigations about
impinging hydrogen jet fires as well as jet fires in confined environment
are lacking. Further studies are recommended to clarify the effects of
impingement on the combustion characteristics, flame structure and
thermal hazards. The radiative characteristics and hazards associated
with very large hydrogen jet fires could increase significantly due to
change in the spectral radiative characteristics. Both experimental and
CFD based numerical analysis should be conducted to quantify the
potential increase in the resulting thermal hazards. Such work, in the
meantime, may also uncover some related knowledge gaps concerning
radiative heat transfer in very large hydrogen fires.

Some limited publications have emerged addressing jet flames in
cryogenic conditions, revealing the existence of different combustion
regimes including ignition with flash-back to the release nozzle, stable
jet flame, a stable lifted flame without flash-back as well as transient
burning with subsequent blow-off. While detailed experimental mea-
surements, which can be used for validation of CFD models for such
conditions, exist as proprietary data, such information is lacking in the
public domain and hence were not discussed in the present review. Ex-
perimental measurements with details about the near field combustion
characteristics of cryogenic hydrogen jet fires will be useful to aid the
understanding as well as facilitate validation of CFD models, which can
then be used to conduct further parametric studies of different scales
and parameters.

7.3. Deflagrations

Considerable efforts have been devoted to experimental, analyti-
cal, and numerical investigations of hydrogen explosions as well as
venting as an effective mitigation measure to reduce over pressure
consequences of explosions. Both medium and large-scale experimental
works have been reported along with CFD validations based on the
reported measurements. Most of these studies focused on the safety
relevant global behavior, especially the development of the overpres-
sure trends. Both experimental and numerical studies are required for
hydrogen vapor cloud explosions from cryogenic releases, for which
significant knowledge gaps exist.

The CFD models used have included commercial codes FLACS,
GASFLOW-MPI, and ANSYS Fluent, the later with some ad-hoc im-
provements through UDFs, as well as the open source CFD code Open-
FOAM. The most often used combustion models have included the
flame wrinkling model, EDC, as well as the more elaborated models
like TFC and ETFC. Quite often in the CFD simulations of large-scale
explosions, it is not possible to define grid resolutions strictly to the
need of resolving the underlying physics. Unless the grid resolutions

would allow the fine details of the underlying physics to be appropri-
ately captured, the potential improvement of predictions by refining
the sub-models will be limited.

Vented explosion tests have been conducted in small, medium and
large-scales with some incorporating the effects of initial turbulence,
realistic obstacles, commercial vent panels and mixtures with concen-
tration gradients. These data constituted a valuable database to support
the development and validation of both engineering correlations and
CFD models. The reviewed CFD simulations have mostly considered the
associated hydrodynamic instabilities and are able to achieve reason-
ably good agreement with the measurements. Three EMs [404,431,435]
have gone through evaluations of the historic data as well as recently
generated data. The recent EM developed by Sinha et al. [435] has also
been accepted for inclusion in the new release of relevant European
standard EN-14994. Existing engineering tools for vented hydrogen de-
flagrations have been developed and validated for situations involving
only one vent. Practical applications often require the considerations
for more than one vent to relieve the explosion overpressure. Further
development of the tools with the assistance of experimental data and
detailed CFD simulations will be useful.

7.4. FA and DDT

The study of FA and DDT is of primary importance for the safety
of practical applications relying on the utilization of hydrogen. A large
number of papers, mainly experimental and numerical ones, have been
published on this topic over the past 15–20 years, allowing a better
understanding of these potentially dramatic events.

Major limitations on the study of FA and DDT include: (i) the
lack of quantitative information concerning the thermodynamic state
of the flow during FA and DDT; (ii) the lack of a rigorous glossary
to describe and characterize the important events taking place during
FA and DDT; and (iii) the lack of knowledge on the propensity for
DDT occurrence in fully unconfined and un-obstructed environments.
Improved imaging techniques should be generalized in future studies
and coupled to quantitative diagnostics to better characterize the flow
field during FA and DDT.

Despite these limitations, a number of recent progresses should
be highlighted. The effect of reactivity/concentration gradients has
been investigated both in obstructed and un-obstructed environments,
allowing to better understand realistic accidental scenarios, such as
those potentially encountered in large-scale facilities. Further work
should be conducted to develop or modify some existing correlations
developed using data obtained in homogeneous mixtures for situations
involving inhomogeneous mixtures. Several studies have employed
advanced imaging approaches, further demonstrating the importance
of the boundary layer and near-wall processes in the occurrence of
DDT event in un-obstructed channels. A very large variety of obstacle
arrangements, shapes, spacings, and characteristics have been studied
and provide a comprehensive overview of effects of these parameters
on FA and DDT. The effect of the obstacle flexibility on the FA process
should be further studied experimentally and numerically, extended to
conditions under which DDT could take place. Finally, the continuous
increase of computational power has enabled to simulate FA and DDT
in large-scale environments, as well as to utilize realistic chemical
models to simulate laboratory-scale configurations.

7.5. Detonation

Detonation related phenomena have received significant attention
over the past 15–20 years. While detonation onset constitutes the most
severe accidental combustion event, many studies were motivated by
propulsion applications of detonation wave.

With the exception of the dynamic detonation parameters, i.e., the
cell size, limiting and critical tube diameters, and the critical initiation
energy, a main limitation in the study of detonation wave is the lack

102

J.X. Wen et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101202

of quantitative data for characterizing the state and composition of
the flow field behind the leading shock wave. The dynamic detonation
parameters are relatively easy to measure, albeit with significant uncer-
tainty. Nevertheless, their actual usefulness remains unclear, and while
some of them can be employed for practical purposes, it is difficult to
relate them to the detailed dynamics of detonation waves.

In recent years, several important advances in the study of det-
onation can be underlined. A noticeable advance corresponds to the
improvement made on the LIF technique, both in terms of modeling
and experimental approaches. In particular, the utilization of NO-LIF
has the potential to provide accurate measurements of the induction
zone length which could be employed to quantitatively validate multi-
dimensional numerical simulations of detonation. Efforts to perform
quantitative measurements in detonation wave should be pursued in
future studies. Significant progresses have also been made in the deter-
mination of the effects of concentration gradients on the propagation of
detonation and in the characterization of quasi-detonation dynamics. In
terms of numerical simulations, recent efforts have been focused on the
inclusion of real gas effects, and of vibrational non-equilibrium, allow-
ing to better characterize the impact of these phenomena. Further ef-
forts in numerical simulations of detonation wave should be focused on
the inclusion of realistic and well validated chemical models, improv-
ing the spatial resolution, and taking into account three-dimensional
effects.
