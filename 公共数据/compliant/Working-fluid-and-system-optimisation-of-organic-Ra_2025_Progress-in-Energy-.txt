Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems are a class of distributed power-generation systems that are suitable for
the efficient conversion of low-to-medium temperature thermal energy to useful power. These versatile systems
have significant potential to contribute in diverse ways to future clean and sustainable energy systems through,
e.g.,  deployment  for  waste-heat  recovery  in  industrial  facilities,  but  also  the  utilisation  of  renewable-heat
sources, thereby improving energy access and living standards, while reducing primary energy consumption
and the associated emissions. The energetic and economic performance, but also environmental sustainability
of ORC systems, all depend strongly on the working fluid employed, and therefore a significant effort has
been made in recent years to select, but also to design novel working fluids for ORC systems. In this context,
computer-aided  molecular  design  (CAMD)  techniques  have  emerged  as  highly  promising  approaches  with
which to explore the key role of working fluids, and present an opportunity, by focusing on the design of
new eco-friendly fluids with low environmental footprints, to identify alternatives to traditional refrigerants
with improved characteristics. In this review article, an overview of working-fluid and system optimisation
methodologies that can be used for the design and operation of next-generation ORC systems is provided. With
reference to wide-ranging applications from waste-heat recovery in industrial and automotive applications, to
biomass, geothermal and solar-energy conversion and/or storage, this review represents a comprehensive,
forward-looking exposition of the application of CAMD to the design of ORC technology.

1.  Introduction

Despite  recent  progress  in  the  development  of  renewable  energy
technologies and their increased deployment, global energy consump-
tion is still dominated by non-renewable sources such as coal, oil, and
natural gas [1]. Given this persisting reliance on fossil fuels and the
significant  amount  of  heat  that  is  inherently  wasted  from  a  diverse
range  of  processes,  important  opportunities  exist  for  the  recovery,
integration, use and/or conversion of this waste heat into electricity
or useful work [2,3], thus enabling energy efficiency improvements,
primary fuel consumption minimisation and, consequently, associated
emissions abatement [4,5]. The recovery and utilisation of industrial
waste-heat  streams  has  the  potential  to  provide  an  additional  8  EJ
of energy towards the annual energy consumption in Europe, thereby

reducing annual primary-energy use by over 15% [6]. The significant
opportunities that exist for technologies suitable for heat recovery and
energy integration are then apparent.

A wide variety of thermal power cycles have been studied for the
purpose  of  industrial  energy  integration  and  power  generation  from
lower-temperature thermal sources, including the Kalina cycle [7–10],
the Goswami cycle [11,12], carbon dioxide cycles [13,14], trilateral
cycles [15–17] and organic Rankine cycles [18–24], along with various
combined cycles [25,26]. Beyond these cycles, more novel and niche
alternative cycles have also been proposed for waste-heat recovery and
conversion  applications,  including  various  thermoacoustic  and  ther-
mofluidic  heat  engines  [27–30],  as  well  as  phase-change  unsteady
heat  engines  such  as  the  non-inertive-feedback  thermofluidic  engine
(NIFTE) [31–37] and the Up-THERM engine [6,38–42].

Amongst all of these options, particular interest has been observed
in organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems due to their applicability to
the  efficient  conversion  of  lower  grade  heat  to  useful  power  [2,4].
ORC  technology  has  been  experiencing  increasingly  wider  adoption
in comparison to competing solutions due to continued performance
improvements and cost reductions, as well as its versatility in being
suited to a wide-ranging mix of heat sources and applications. However,
it  remains  beset  by  a  number  of  technical  challenges;  in  particular,
working-fluid design and selection are key areas of ongoing attention
and research focus [18,21,43–45]. The working fluid is an important
and integral element of ORC systems as it has a direct bearing on the
design and specifications of key components and overall system size
and also affects important operational procedures. Therefore it has a
controlling role in determining not only the technical and thermody-
namic  performance  but  also  the  capital/investment  and  operational
costs of these systems and, thus, ultimately, their financial viability and
potential deployment in real applications.

Traditionally,  working-fluid  selection  for  ORC  systems  has  been
performed  via ad  hoc selection  rules  and  predefined  screening  lists
and criteria [46–52]. Following this conventional practice is inevitably
time-consuming and sub-optimal. Typically, multiple system-level op-
timisation studies are undertaken, drawing from a database of known,
pre-existing  fluids  of  known  chemical  families,  of  which  the  ther-
mophysical  properties  are  readily  available  [53,54].  The  process  is
complicated  by  the  numerous  chemical  families  and  working-fluid
options available, with a risk of missing suitable fluids if these are not
included a priori in the search database. Such approaches can also lead
to sub-optimal system designs and limit the flexibility in the design of
working fluids for ORCs, especially when one considers the possible
use  of  fluid  mixtures  [4].  A  further  complication  is  that  differing
ORC applications generally have different requirements, whereby this
approach can neither be used to identify new and potentially novel

4

working fluids nor be used to inform on the prospective manufacturing
processes required.

Computer-aided  molecular  design  (CAMD)  offers  a  more  holistic
approach  to  the  design  of  working  fluids  for  ORC  power  systems
across a wide range of applications, wherein the molecular structure of
prospective working fluids is optimised simultaneously alongside the
ORC  system  design  and  operation  in  a  single  optimisation  problem.
This has been facilitated by the development of advanced fluid theories
rooted in interactions on the molecular scale, providing an opportunity
for the intelligent design of working fluids for any ORC system con-
figuration [4,55], and bypassing the pre-emptive screening criteria of
traditional methods. When applying CAMD to ORC systems, potential
working fluids are described by functional groups; these groups can be
combined in different ways to form novel molecules such that a handful
of groups can be used to describe a large number of potential working
fluids across multiple chemical families. This presents a powerful tool
for  understanding  the  impact  of  the  working  fluid  on  the  design,
performance,  sizing,  environmental  impact,  and  operation  of  ORC
power systems.

With CAMD, several molecular groups with free bonding sites are
defined; these could be individual single/double/triple bonds or mul-
tiple  combinations  of  these,  (e.g.,  –CH3,  =CH2, >CH2, >CH–, >C<,
=CH–). These molecular groups can then be combined accordingly to
form a large number of different hydrocarbon molecules. Theoretically,
a collection of such molecular groups (including those with halogenated
groups  to  form  refrigerants)  can  be  used  to  describe  any  arbitrary
molecule, so long as all relevant groups present in the molecule are
incorporated in the decision space. While CAMD was initially applied
to solvent-design problems considering molecular target functions [56],
it has been further developed to integrate the design of process mod-
els  to  consider  a  process-based  target  function  (thus,  the  develop-
ment of computer-aided molecular and process design, CAMPD), to ad-
vance the integrated design and optimisation of solvent and separation
processes [57–60].

Aside from the required process models and constraints, such CAMPD
problems require molecular feasibility constraints to ensure that the
solutions  generated  from  the  combination  of  the  molecular  groups
represent genuine molecules [61–63]. A group-contribution equation
of state (EoS) is also typically required to provide accurate estimates of
the fluid properties of a molecule based on the constituent molecular
groups. Group-contribution models like those of Joback and Reid [64]
can provide pure-component property values as inputs to cubic EoS,
whereas  group-contribution  activity  coefficient  models  such  as  UNI-
FAC  [65]  can  be  combined  with  such  EoS  to  account  for  both  the
vapour  and  liquid  phase  behaviour  of  working  fluids.  While  those
are empirical in nature, an alternative would be to deploy molecular
EoS  such  as  those  based  on  the  statistical  associating  fluid  theory
(SAFT) [66,67]; group-contribution versions of these EoS are also read-
ily available [68–79] (see Section 4 for a discussion). By means of such
group-contribution  EoS  one  can  predict  the  properties  of  a  working
fluid  based  on  its  constituent  molecular  groups,  and  the  molecular
structure of the fluid can be optimised simultaneously alongside the
system, potentially identifying novel working fluids which may other-
wise be overlooked [4]. Finally, an optimisation algorithm is required
to  provide  a  solution  to  the  problem  formulation;  such  algorithms
are usually of the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) type
due to the integer nature of the molecular groups (and possibly other
process variables) involved in the problem.

In this paper, a comprehensive review of CAMD techniques as ap-
plied to ORC systems design is presented in the context of the efficient
and economically feasible conversion of heat to power. The discussed
design techniques are relevant to a diverse range of energy applications
featuring a variety of heat sources, from geothermal and biomass to
solar and waste heat. The details involved in formulating and solving
the  optimisation  problems  describing  the  ORC  system  and  working-
fluid design simultaneously are examined, while the important role of

working-fluid property prediction via various equation-of-state models
is  also  explored.  Finally,  the  review  is  concluded  with  a  discussion
of the outlook of working-fluid design for ORC power systems, their
impact on technology development in important energy applications,
and current challenges and opportunities, along with promising future
research directions.

2.  Overview of organic Rankine cycle power systems

2.1.  State-of-the-art

Rankine  cycles  are  a  well-known  principle  in  power  production
today. In a Rankine cycle, water (i.e., the working fluid) is evaporated
in the evaporator. This evaporated working fluid then flows through an
expander, effectively transforming heat into work. Subsequently, the
working fluid condenses by rejecting thermal energy to a heat sink.
Finally, a pump pressurises the working fluid, closing the loop. This
cycle is often used with water in large-capacity thermal plants where
the heat source comes either from combustion, nuclear fission, or other
relatively high-temperature heat (> 300 °C) from, for example, solar
sources. In Fig. 1, we show the main components, overall configuration
and flows in a simple Rankine cycle system.

This  cycle  can  also  use  other  working  fluids  instead  of  water.
Usually these are organic in nature, and the cycle is then referred to as
an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), with the working fluid being typically
a compound that exhibits its boiling point at lower temperatures than
water. Throughout the article, when using the terms ‘‘ORC’’ (without
any  qualifier),  or  ‘‘simple  ORC’’,  we  are  referring  to  the  cycle  as
illustrated  in Fig.  1,  either  with  or  without  superheating.  We  note
that some authors use the term ‘‘basic ORC’’ equivalently, although to
avoid confusion we avoid this terminology since it is sometimes used
to indicate exclusively the cycle without superheat.

ORCs are hereby applicable as power-production cycles on lower-
temperature ranges where the traditional vapour Rankine cycle is too
inefficient or costly to operate. In Fig. 2, we show the operation range
for typical ORCs based on the temperature of the heat source and the
electrical power of the installation. The figure is divided into different
regions:  ocean  thermal  energy  conversion  (OTEC),  micro  combined
heat  and  power  (μCHP)  systems,  steam  Rankine  cycles  and  main-
stream ORC systems. Mainstream ORC systems typically use waste heat,
geothermal energy or heat from biomass combustion as the heat source.
However, the applicability of ORC applications keeps extending. This is
partly due to new cycle topologies but also due to the introduction of

new working fluids that, for example, extend the ORC fluid thermal
stability  limit  to  higher  temperatures.  It  is  important  to  note  that
ORC efficiency is significantly impacted when the power rating and/or
heat  source  temperature  decrease.  The  temperature  impact  follows
from thermodynamic (Carnot efficiency) limitations, while size has an
impact on the relative losses and investment potential for increased
optimisation. Fig.  2 suggests  that  larger  ORC systems  with  a  higher
power-rating can offset the detrimental effect of attempting to operate
with reduced heat-source temperatures, and can remain cost-effective
when used in lower temperature applications.

2.2.  ORC market and potential

The  ORC  is  a  key  technology  in  increasing  the  effective  use  of
medium and low-temperature heat sources. The ORC can be applied
to  convert  a  wide  variety  of  heat  sources  [83],  but  currently,  it  is
primarily used in geothermal, waste-heat recovery (WHR), and biomass
applications [84]. These three together form 99% of the installed ORC
power. Other smaller utilised sources are waste-to-energy, solar, and
ocean thermal energy. The Knowledge Center on Organic Rankine Cycle
technology (KCORC) [85] performed market reports in 2016 and 2020,
which showed that the installed power at the end of 2020 was 4.1 GW,
of which 29% was installed in the last 4 years. Another 430 MW has
been installed or is planned to be installed since December 2020 [84].
This  indicates  the  clear  growth  of  this  technology,  in  particular  for
manufacturers of large (1 MW) ORC installations (ORMAT, Turboden,
and  EXERGY),  which  have  all  increased  their  installed  capacity  by
around 40%–50% in the past four years [84]. Yet, also manufacturers
of small ORC units have substantially increased their installed capacity.
In assessing the potential of this technology, we can consider the
available global waste-heat resource that can be technically recovered.
Waste  heat  has  been  found  to  account  for  over  half  of  the  global
primary energy [86]. As such, waste heat alone was in 2012 globally
estimated [87] to be around 68 PWh with a Carnot potential of 13 PWh.
In  particular,  significant  unutilised  low-grade  waste  heat  is  rejected
from  industrial  facilities  to  the  environment  [88,89].  This  untapped
resource has been found to amount to 15%–20% of the total industrial
energy consumption in the EU, UK and USA [90–92].

Looking at the KCORC [85] reports, only a very small fraction of
that potential is exploited. Economic considerations could affect the
exploitation potential. When comparing the specific investment cost of
ORC systems relative to other installations (e.g., internal combustion
engines, gas turbines, hydro, wind, or solar), the specific cost of an ORC
should be around 2500–3500 Euro/kW to be economically viable [93]
(2017). This only takes into account the revenue of the power output
and no indirect costs are considered such as related to environmental
impact  and  reliability.  The  investment  cost  for  an  ORC  unit  can  be
estimated around 2000–4000 Euro/kW [94] (2016), where the higher
values are typically for smaller installations. Efforts should be taken
to reduce the specific cost, especially for small-scale installations, and
that research should include thermodynamic, economic, and technical
aspects  to  be  optimised  [93].  Also  the  importance  of  the  electricity
cost from the grid should not be neglected, as was also found in case
studies [95].

2.3.  Selection of optimal working fluids

Working-fluid selection is an important and intrinsic part of ORC
design. There are no a priori ‘‘best’’ working fluids for ORC applications
because  the  choice  of  the  optimal  fluid  depends  on  several  design
aspects which are application-dependent and do not concern only the
plant energy performance. For instance, working-fluid characteristics
also influence the safety and cost of the installation [96–99]. These are:

• Specific cost; this has a rather direct impact on the ORC unit cost,

especially for large power capacity.

• Flammability; flammable fluids, such as hydrocarbons, are in use
in ORC plants, but they induce additional safety complications
and consequently increase the cost.

• Toxicity; toxic fluids can be used, but they bring with them extra

safety measurements and costs.

• Material compatibility; the working fluid has to be compatible
with all materials within the installation. This includes the metals
and elastomer seals of the machines but also lubricating oil(s).
• Environmental impact; while there are many indexes that would
need to be considered to enable a comprehensive environmental
impact assessment [100], two indexes have been mainly used in

6

C.N. Markides et al.

the published literature: the Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and
the Global Warming Potential (GWP). The ODP is the amount of
degradation a fluid causes to the ozone layer compared to CFC-11,
which has a fixed ODP of 1. Similarly, the GWP gives a measure
of the effect as a greenhouse gas relative to CO2 over a time frame
of 100 years.

• Thermal stability; the risk that working fluids will decompose to
other chemical constituents. While this will have a direct effect
on the original fluid thermodynamic and thermophysical proper-
ties, it can also degrade heat transfer, introduce non-condensable
gasses, or lead to corrosion problems.

Working-fluid thermodynamic characteristics that are important for

the cycle performance [96–99] are:

• Critical point; the critical point is important for multiple reasons.
Firstly, it determines the type of cycle. If the critical pressure is
above the maximum operating pressure, the cycle is subcritical,
as shown in Fig. 1. When the critical pressure is above the max-
imum operating pressure, the cycle is transcritical, as explained
later. The optimal critical temperature range is typically closely
related to the temperature of the thermal source. In practice [99],
the chosen critical temperature is often slightly larger than the
targeted evaporation temperature in subcritical ORCs. As such, a
better match with the heat transfer-fluid is achieved, resulting in
a higher average temperature during heat addition and, therefore,
higher thermal efficiency. Note that close to the critical point,
the specific heat of vaporisation is small, leading to higher pump
work [101].

• Dew-curve slope; a working fluid can be either defined as dry,
isentropic,  or  wet  depending  on  the  slope  of  the  saturation
vapour-pressure curve on the T –s diagram, i.e., ξ = (ds∕dT )x=1,
where s is  the  specific  entropy, T the  temperature  and x the
vapour quality. A fluid is defined as ‘dry’ when ξ > 0, ‘isentropic’
when ξ =  0,  and  ‘wet’  when ξ  < 0.  A  dry  fluid  is  consid-
ered beneficial because droplets, which may impinge on turbine
blades, cannot be formed along the expansion process as the fluid
expands through a superheated-vapour region. However, for very
dry fluids, the condenser load can become significantly high due
to the high degree of superheating reached by the vapour at the
end  of  the  expansion  process.  It  is  noted,  with  respect  to  the
above, that the fluid classification based on the dew-curve slope
has been the traditional classification approach of pure working
fluids, introduced by Tabor and Bronicki [102], and later Badr
et  al.  [103].  In  a  more  recent  approach,  Györke  et  al.  [104]
identifies limitations with this classification, and introduces a new
categorisation  approach  comprising  eight  distinct  fluid  classes:
ACZ,  ACZM,  AZCM,  ANZCM,  ANCZM,  ANCMZ,  ACNZM,  AC-
NMZ.  This  new  approach  is  useful  as  it  further  facilitates  the
identification of working fluids for ORCs.

• Density; a low density leads to high volume flow rates. This leads
to  higher  pressure  drops  in  the  heat  exchangers  and  a  larger
size  of  the  expander,  thus  increasing  the  cost  of  the  plant.  At
the same time, a low fluid density facilitates the realisation of
turbomachines also in small power-capacity applications.

• Enthalpy of vaporisation; a high enthalpy of vaporisation is pre-
ferred as it increases the thermal efficiency due to ‘carnotisation
of the cycle’ as more heat is added during evaporation [105,106].
However, other authors [107,108] say that low enthalpy of va-
porisation is better. In this way the temperature profile of the
working fluid matches better with the heat transfer-fluid and this
effectively increases the second-law efficiency.

• Viscosity; a low viscosity is beneficial in achieving low frictional

losses and promotes better heat transfer rates.

• Thermal  conductivity;  this  must  be  high  to  achieve  high  heat-

transfer rates per surface area.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

• Melting  temperature;  the  working  fluid  should  never  solidify
within the ORC circuits. The melting temperature should thus be
below the lowest possible ambient temperature.

• Condensing pressure; a condensing pressure above atmospheric
is advisable to reduce the risk of infiltration of non-condensable
gasses,  which  would  lead  to  degradation  of  the  system  perfor-
mance [109]. Another benefit is the reduction in expander price
due to the smaller volumetric ratio.

• Evaporating  pressure;  a  higher  evaporating  pressure  results  in
higher component cost and more-stringent safety considerations.
• Boiling point; a lower boiling point allows the working fluid to

evaporate from low-temperature heat sources.

The design of a cycle and choice of working fluid, which should be
performed simultaneously, can be based on various figures of merit,
depending on the application:

• Thermal efficiency [110,111]; the thermal efficiency is defined as
the net output work divided by the input thermal energy [110].
The  maximum  thermal  efficiency  of  any  power  cycle  between
two infinite thermal reservoirs at temperatures TL (low) and TH
(high) is the Carnot efficiency, defined as ηcarnot = 1 − TL∕TH. For
non-infinite  reservoirs  a  logarithmic  mean  temperature  can  be
used. The thermal efficiency is a common figure of merit for cycle
design.

• Exergy efficiency [112] (also known as the second-law efficiency);
This is defined as the net output power divided by the incoming
exergy flow of the heat transfer-fluid. This efficiency is often used
for  low-grade  heat-recovery  applications  because  the  thermal
efficiency does not take into account the finite thermal capacity
of the heat source.

• Cost-effectiveness; not only the thermodynamic efficiencies are
important but the cost of the installation can influence the de-
cision as well. It is possible to optimise the design based on a
thermo-economic objective function, as in [45]. As an alternative,
the  ratio  of  the  total  heat-exchanger  surface  area  to  the  net
produced  power  is  a  good  measurement  for  the  cost  per  unit
of  power  of  the  ORC  unit  [113].  This  is  not  to  been  further
substantiated against actual ORC prices.

A  working  fluid  should  be  chosen  considering  the  above  figures
of  merit,  given  the  chosen  cycle  configuration.  There  is  a  wide  va-
riety  of  possible  working-fluid  choices:  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs);
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs); hydrochlorofluoroolefin (HCFOs);
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); hydrofluoroolefin (HFOs); siloxanes; and
many  others  [114].  Some  of  these  may  no  longer  be  used  due  to
legislation. For example, due to the Montreal Protocol, 98% of ozone-
depleting substances (ODS) have been phased out globally compared
to 1990 levels. These regulations primarily imposed restrictions on the
utilisations of CFCs and HCFCs. Nowadays, refrigerants with high GWP
are in the process of being phased out. Depending on the country, there
are different regulations, but the trend is to ban the use of fluids with
GWP to 150 by 2030. Current GWP values are set at IPCC 4, but all
refrigerants  have  been  reassessed  during  IPCC  6  [114].  Refrigerants
are also classified according to whether they can be found in nature or
not. The natural refrigerants include ammonia, water, carbon dioxide,
and hydrocarbons. They exhibit zero ODP and low GWP values and,
in general, are compatible with elastomers of common use in industry.
Another important benefit is that they do not contain chlorine or fluo-
rine. Thus, they do not form aggressive acids when coming into contact
with water, a common cause of system failure in plants operating with
synthetic refrigerants [115].

Some refrigerants are actually mixtures of various refrigerants. For
example, R410a is a specific mixture of R32 and R125. These mixtures
can be azeotropic, showing no temperature glide during phase change,
or zeotropic. In this case, a temperature glide is observed during phase
change. This can be beneficial for a better temperature profile matching

with the heat source or sink. Changing the mixture percentage has an
influence on the amount of temperature glide [116]. The mixture com-
position gives immense flexibility in the optimal selection of working
fluids, therefore CAMD can be an important asset [117–119].

2.4.  ORC architectures and operating conditions

In this section, different cycle configurations will be discussed and
described.  The  simple  ORC  system,  as  shown  in Fig.  1,  is  the  first
possible architecture, as also introduced in Section 2.1.

A first possible adaption is the addition of a recuperator (Fig. 3),
whose purpose is to recover part of the thermal energy of the vapour
after expansion to preheat the working fluid pumped to the evaporator.
With respect to the simple ORC system, this results in a higher power
output per unit of heat input, or a higher thermal efficiency [110]. The
use of a recuperator does require that the vapour exhibit some degree
of  superheating  at  the  expander  outlet,  meaning  that  dry  fluids  are
necessary. It is important to note that the additional heat exchanger
also increases the installation cost and the overall pressure drop in the
working-fluid loop.

Another possibility is to cascade ORC systems, as shown in Fig. 4,
where a two-stage ORC system is presented. The heat exchanger that
works as an evaporator for the bottom cycle functions also as a con-
denser  for  the  topping  cycle.  The  expander  design  can  be  further
optimised for each working-fluid loop according to the selected tem-
perature  and  pressure  ranges.  Selection  of  the  optimal  combination
of working fluids could be achieved with CAMD. It is also important
to  note  that  the  thermal  input  is  fully  determined  by  the  topping
unit, while the thermal input in the cascaded cycles depends on the
thermal energy rejected during condensation in the working-fluid loops
above [120,121].

The addition of turbine bleeding and direct-contact heat exchangers
(Fig. 5) leads to so-called regenerative ORC system configurations. Tur-
bine bleeding refers to the process of extracting a portion of the steam
or gas from a turbine during operation. The preheating effect achieved
is similar to that in recuperator cycles. The difference, however, lies
in the type of heat exchanger used to preheat the liquid leaving the
condenser  and  the  source  of  thermal  energy  used  for  this  purpose.
It has been shown that regenerative cycles have higher thermal effi-
ciencies than the simple ORC system, and that the irreversibilities are
smaller,  resulting  in  higher  second-law  efficiencies  [122].  However,
the authors also note that this improvement heavily depends on the
used working fluid; the improvements in efficiency were negligible for
some working fluids, which would not justify the additional component

cost  in  practice.  Furthermore,  any  performance  improvements  must
more than compensate for the added capital investment and operat-
ing/maintenance costs. Therefore, these substantial modifications are
typically reserved for larger-scale systems, for which the implementa-
tion cost is lower relative to the performance benefits. In addition, in
many low-temperature applications, such as geothermal, waste or other
renewable heat sources, it will not result in a higher output power or
fuel reduction.

Another possibility is to combine different cycle adaptations. The
regenerative cycle with a recuperator is a common example of such
a combination.

Another  way  to  reduce  the  irreversibilities  associated  with  heat
transfer is to realise a cycle with multiple pressure levels, as shown
in Fig. 6. Here, the thermal energy is added to the cycle through two
evaporators operating at two different pressure levels.

In Fig.  7 we  illustrate  an  additional  configuration  known  as  the
organic flash cycle (OFC). With respect to the simple ORC system con-
figuration, a flash tank is installed downstream of the heat exchanger,
where the working fluid is heated up. The reason is that no working-
fluid  evaporation  occurs  during  the  heat-transfer  process.  The  dry
vapour needed to power the turbine is then generated in the flash tank,
which introduces a pressure drop causing a fraction of the working fluid
to evaporate. The same tank performs the function of separating the re-
sulting two-phase flow. The saturated vapour is routed to the expander,
while the saturated liquid is immediately routed to the condenser over
a throttling valve. The advantage of this cycle configuration is the good
temperature profile match with the heat source if the working fluid is
well chosen. A drawback, instead, is that saturated vapour is fed into
the turbine. This means that for wet working fluids, the vapour quality
diminishes along the expansion process. This has to be accounted for

in the expander design, which increases the production cost. Another
important drawback are the associated throttling irreversibilities over
the expansion valves. In Fig. 7, we show only the most simple OFC
system  configuration.  Different  variations  are  possible,  for  instance,
by including in the system multiple flash tanks, phase separators, and
expanders to split the corresponding thermodynamic transformations
over different pressure levels.

There are also other ways to reduce the irreversibilities associated
with heat transfer. The cycle configurations discussed in the following
share the same configuration as the simple ORC (Fig. 1), but they differ
in their operating principles. Firstly, in the trilateral cycle (TLC), the
working fluid is heated up only to saturated-liquid conditions before
it is fed to the expander. The TLC operating principle is thus similar
to  that  of  the  OFC  presented  earlier.  The  difference  lies  in  the  fact
that no flash tank is adopted: the fluid directly expands from a liquid
state in the expander. The temperature-profile matching in the heat
exchanger  interconnected  with  the  thermal  source,  also  called  the
primary  heat  exchanger,  results  in  higher  second-law  efficiencies  of
the TLC compared to the simple ORC [17]. Nevertheless, the overall
thermal efficiency of the TLC tends to be lower due to the relatively
low critical temperature of organic fluids [123]. This makes the TLC
more applicable as a bottoming cycle. A bottoming cycle utilises waste
heat  from  a  primary  cycle,  leading  to  increased  power  output.  The
bottoming cycle therefore operates at lower temperatures then the top
cycle  in  the  cascade.  Another  drawback  of  this  solution  is  that  the
fluid  volume  flow  rate  drastically  increases  compared  to  the  simple

Fig. 7. Configuration of an organic flash cycle system.

ORC. A second option is to partially evaporate the working fluid in
the primary heat exchanger, realising a cycle known as the partially
evaporating ORC (PEORC). The achievable second-law efficiency and
specific volume flow rate are somewhere between those of a simple
ORC and a TLC. It has been shown [124] that the PEORC can increase

9

C.N. Markides et al.

the net power output of the system compared to the TLC. However,
both the TLC and PEORC do require an expander capable of handling
two-phase flows, and this technology is not readily available.

Lastly, it is possible to increase the maximum pressure of the cycle
above the fluid critical pressure. This results in a transcritical cycle.
Because the working-fluid heating happens in supercritical conditions,
the temperature profile can be matched to the heat source, depending
on  the  working  fluid.  Similarly  to  the  TLC,  the  transcritical  cycle
could show lower thermal efficiencies (due to high pumping power)
in  favour  of  increased  heat  addition  to  the  cycle  and  reduced  irre-
versibilities (neglecting possible increased pressure drop) in the vapour
generator [125]. An interesting working fluid for transcritical cycles
is carbon dioxide [126]. Due to the low critical temperature (31 ◦ C),
the  supercritical  state  can  already  be  achieved  for  low  temperature
heat  sources.  Because  it  is  a  natural  refrigerant,  it  also  has  a  small
environmental impact as mentioned before.

A final adaptation is to use zeotropic mixtures, resulting in non-
isothermal phase changes depending on the mixture composition. These
fluids can be used in all topologies and configurations mentioned ear-
lier. Their benefit is that their temperature profiles during phase change
can be matched to the heat transfer-fluid or heat sink, reducing the irre-
versibilities and thus increasing the plant efficiency. It was shown [19]
that the best second-law efficiencies for zeotropic simple ORC cycles are
obtained by matching the temperature profiles of the working fluid and
the heat sink. Literature about zeotropic refrigerants combined with
various cycle architectures is scarce. In some studies [19,127] it has
been shown that zeotropic mixtures do improve the exergy efficiency
of supercritical cycles and cycles with a recuperator.

As can be seen from the above brief review, many cycle configura-
tions and operating principles exist. The system performance does not
depend on only the cycle configuration and heat-source characteristics,
but also the chosen working medium and its composition in the case of
a zeotropic mixture [128]. This means that choosing an optimal design
is no simple feat, and the assistance of CAMD for working-fluid design
and selection is a much-welcome tool.

2.5.  Off-design operation

Cycles are typically designed around their nominal working condi-
tions.  However,  they  should  still  operate  in  off-design  conditions  as
the  heat  source  or  the  heat  sink  are  frequently  transient  in  nature.
Furthermore,  due  to  component  selection  based  on  availability  and
cost, the actual operation can deviate from the original design condi-
tions. Part-load operation, meaning that the work output is modulated
according  to  a  set-point,  is  less  common.  ORCs  typically  operate  at
full power, extracting the maximum work out of a heat transfer-fluid.
The temperature and mass flow rates of these flows have a significant
influence on the system performance [129]. The mass flow rate of the
heat transfer-fluid is a key variable in net power generation. However,
contrary to expectation, the plant efficiency could decrease due to the
faster increase of condensing pressure resulting from increasing heat-
source flow rate and temperature [130]. A key component in off-design
cycle performance is the expander, as its isentropic efficiency and filling
factor vary with suction pressure and temperature and with discharge
pressure, influencing the system thermal efficiency [131]. The filling
factor  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  actual  volume  flow  rate  of  gas
drawn into expander to the theoretical volume flow rate based on its
working chamber geometry and the expander speed. A low filling factor
is detrimental as the expander is not utilised effectively. However, a
high filling factor does not necessarily mean that a higher power output
is achieved. It is possible that due to leakage paths the flow bypasses
much of the expansion process.

In literature, three methods are applied for simulating off-design
conditions [132]: a constant-efficiency method, a polynomial regres-
sion  method,  and  a  semi-empirical  method.  The  constant-efficiency
method, as its name suggests, is based on an assumption of constant

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

component  efficiencies  and  filling  factors  independent  of  the  opera-
tional  design  conditions.  In  the  polynomial  regression  method,  one
adapts  the  component  efficiencies  and  filling  factors  to  the  operat-
ing  conditions  by  means  of  a  polynomial  function.  A  second-order
multivariate polynomial [132] is frequently used. Lastly, in the semi-
empirical method, one models the components by means of physically-
based equations. On a component level, the discrepancies with exper-
imental data of a polynomial regression method and a semi-empirical
method can give comparable results. The coupling of polynomial re-
gression methods could show unreliability on the system level, while
this is not the case for a semi-empirical method [132]. Zeotropic mix-
tures are also interesting for off-design conditions, even though not a lot
of literature covers this topic. However, it was shown that a zeotropic
ORC outperforms a simple ORC in off-design conditions [133]. The au-
thors investigated a composition-adjustable ORC, where the zeotropic
mixture can be altered by adding or removing one of the two compo-
nents online. They concluded that there is an increase in performance,
but that it is not worth the extra investment cost and cycle complexity.

3.  Computer-aided design of ORC power systems

3.1.  Overview of fluid and ORC design problem challenges

By  definition,  the  goal  of  CAMD  is  to  determine  the  chemical
structures of molecules that optimise a set of properties that represent
desired  performance  targets  [56].  Both  parts  of  this  definition, i.e.,
the ‘‘chemical structures’’ and the ‘‘properties’’, have very significant
effects  on  the  working-fluid  and  ORC  design  procedures  and  their
performance [134].

In conventional approaches, the working fluid in an ORC system is
selected from a set of pre-determined molecular structures that usually
results from prior know-how about the suitability of some fluids for
the  given  process  [135,136].  Such  fluids  are  hereafter  described  as
conventional working fluids. This is very limiting in view of the vast
number of molecular structures (billions) [137] that could be consid-
ered  as  ORC  working-fluid  options.  Such  an  approach  prohibits  the
discovery of novel molecular structures that may be worth synthesising,
or of molecular structures that exist and are commercially available but
have never before been used in ORCs and may therefore be consid-
ered novel ORC working fluid options [98]. In CAMD, the molecular
structures  result  from  the  combination  of  molecular  fragments  that
could  be  functional  groups,  atoms,  or  bonds  [138].  This  is  because
the properties of a molecule can be estimated through contributions
from its fragments [139]. Systematic approaches are often used that
facilitate the evaluation of combinations of these molecular fragments
until  a  chemical  composition  is  identified  that  exhibits  the  highest
performance according to the selected figures of merit. The advantage
of  this  approach  is  that  vast  numbers  of  molecular  structures  may
be  attained  by  forming  combinations  from  a  finite  set  of  less  than
200 molecular fragments [140]. This enables the discovery of novel
molecular structures. Furthermore, there is no need to derive a database
of  pre-existing  molecules,  hence  avoiding  the  arbitrary  exclusion  of
molecular structures that could exhibit high performance when used in
an ORC. The immense number of combinations makes the fluid-design
problem computationally challenging, even for pure working fluids.

These computational requirements have not prevented researchers
from targeting the design of fluid mixtures, which enable higher exer-
getic performance than pure fluids for certain ORC applications [21].
In the context of CAMD, the identification of the desired ORC mixture
requires the simultaneous determination of (i) the number of pure com-
ponents that will comprise the mixture, (ii) the chemical composition of
each pure component, and (iii) the concentration of each component in
the mixture [141]. It is clear that this induces additional combinatorial
complexity, which has been addressed through various approaches over
the years for the design of both pure and mixed working fluids [134].
Optimisation  algorithms  appear  to  be  the  most  efficient  among  the

10

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

existing  approaches,  as  the  synthesis  of  the  chemical  structure(s)  is
systematically guided by the algorithmic operations in order to avoid
the exhaustive enumeration of all options [142].

The above are major requirements that pertain to the identification
of appropriate ORC working fluids with respect to their chemical struc-
ture. The determination and calculation of the ‘‘desired properties’’ that
may lead to the appropriate working fluids raise additional, significant
challenges. The development of CAMD has been based on the advent
of group contribution (GC) methods [65]. These provide quantitative
structure–activity relationships (QSPRs) that enable the prediction of
the working-fluid properties based on their molecular-fragment con-
stituents. The original CAMD implementation in ORCs [98] was based
on GC QSPRs [143] for the prediction of pure-component properties
at  standard  conditions  [139].  Such  QSPRs  can  be  used  as  input  to
cubic EoS to predict the vapour–liquid behaviour of mixtures as well
as enthalpies and other important properties. In recent years, advanced
EoS have also been developed that introduce physical molecular char-
acteristics in the prediction of mixture properties, hence avoiding the
use of QSPRs; these include SAFT [66,67] and its many variants, includ-
ing PC-SAFT [144], SAFT-VR Mie [145] and SAFT-γ Mie [79]. In the
case of PC-SAFT, the CAMD problem formulation was further changed
into one where discrete molecular structure decisions were replaced by
continuous targeting of molecules [57]. All these developments are im-
portant and have been used in ORC molecular or molecular-and-process
design applications [51,134,146]. Depending on the performance met-
ric  against  which  the  ORC  system  is  optimised,  different  ‘‘desired
properties’’  are  of  interest.  To  determine  the  relevant  properties  as
well  as  their  search  directions,  the  relationships  between  economic
and thermodynamic performance criteria commonly employed in ORC
design  and  working-fluid  properties  have  been  developed  [147].  In
addition to core criteria related to thermodynamic efficiency and eco-
nomics, additional criteria related to safety and environmental impacts
of working fluids, such as toxicity or GWP, have been considered [98].
The  advantage  of  using  molecular  or  mixture  properties  as  tar-
gets  in  CAMD  is  that  the  need  to  develop  and  incorporate  an  ORC
model is avoided, with beneficial effects on the ease of implementation
and  computational  complexity.  Such  approaches  have  succeeded  in
identifying efficient working fluids [98,137], as shown in subsequent
studies that performed an exhaustive evaluation of millions of working-
fluid structures using ORC model simulations [148] or thermodynamic
analysis of the atomic chemistries of the derived fluids [149]. However,
as the working fluids are inherent components of the ORC system, their
design or selection procedure should account for the prevailing ORC
operating conditions and equipment characteristics in order to evaluate
the economic and environmental behaviour of the system in which they
will be used. Depending on the level of detail of the employed ORC
model, it is possible to capture the equipment interactions at the ORC
system level, the dynamics of the processes in view of disturbances, the
changes in the temperature of the thermal energy sources and sinks, or
even local heat and mass transfer phenomena. All these characteristics
may affect the selection of the working fluid, putting emphasis on the
specific application needs and eventually expediting the development
and delivery of such systems. Clearly, the simultaneous evaluation of
the widest possible set of fluid and ORC system options with models of
high resolution, both in space and time, would be highly desirable in
order to attain designs that are both optimum and realistic prior to their
practical implementation. However, such a formulation would result
in an intractable computational problem. The need to address these
challenges has fostered the development of various methods that:

(a) Consider the design or selection of single fluids or mixtures1;

1 The mixture-selection problem refers to the determination of the optimum
number of components and/or concentration of a mixed fluid, using an initial
set of pure components with pre-specified chemical structures. The mixture-
design problem includes the determination of the chemical structure of at least
one of the components.

(b) Implement exhaustive enumeration of all design options or em-
ploy optimisation algorithms, considering single or multiple cri-
teria;

(c) Integrate  ORC  models  either  as  part  or  after  the  design  or

selection of fluids;

(d) Consider ORC equipment models of varying resolutions or ORC
and heat source/sink configurations of varying structures;
(e) Account for the uncertainties in the property prediction or in the

ORC equipment models;

(f) Propose designs considering steady-state or off-design operation.

To this end, important approaches have been developed that im-
plement CAMD (i.e., the determination of molecular structures of ORC
working  fluids)  considering  some  of  the  above  features.  These  ap-
proaches will be discussed in  Section 5. In the current section, we
will  address  how  the  above  considerations  have  been  accounted  for
as  part  of  fluid-selection  approaches.  The  latter  is  not  without  sig-
nificant  challenges.  For  example,  the  simultaneous  mixture-selection
and process-design problem requires the use of efficient optimisation
formulations and algorithms to attain high-quality designs, whereas the
consideration of high-resolution models in fluid selection requires very
intense computations. In all the above areas, there are important fluid-
selection and ORC-design contributions that need to be discussed in
order to highlight the following:

• Opportunities and challenges in future research efforts, as existing
CAMD approaches will move to integrate additional features;
• The features of the different methods and models, as prerequisites

for the understanding of the CAMD methods in Section 5;

• The benefits of CAMD over fluid selection approaches.

With  respect  to  points (a), (b), (c),  in  this  section,  we  review
works  that  include  mixture-selection  problems,  using  either  single-
or multi-objective optimisation algorithms. The focus is on the most-
advanced approaches that exhibit interesting methodological insights.
The results of straightforward implementations of such approaches, or
of approaches that employ either single or mixed fluids in an exhaustive
enumeration  of  options  and  eventually  present  mainly  technological
insights with respect to ORC operation, are not within the scope of this
section. The selection of mixtures is more challenging than that of pure
fluids because of the higher combinatorial complexity (mixture concen-
tration or composition are additional design variables) but also because
the non-ideal phase-change behaviour of mixtures introduces numerical
challenges. These features often result in different, non-trivial optimisa-
tion approaches in order to address the increased computational effort.
In points (d), (e), and (f), we are covering contributions with either pure
or mixed fluids, exhaustive enumeration, or optimisation approaches.
These points include considerably fewer works and represent directions
for future developments.

3.2.  Mixture selection using optimisation algorithms

In  this  section,  we  present  approaches  where  the  concentration
of mixtures comprising fluids of pre-specified structures, or the mix-
ture composition itself (i.e., the type and combination of pre-specified
fluid structures that comprise the mixture), are optimisation variables,
together with the ORC design parameters. The considered ORC configu-
rations are mainly of the simple or of the recuperated type, whereas in a
few cases, the ORC extracts heat or provides power to more-extensive
process systems. The reviewed studies include single-objective (SOO)
and muti-objective optimisation (MOO) formulations, which integrate
not only models for thermodynamic-cycle calculations but also models
for preliminary sizing of the ORC components, such as heat exchangers
and expanders. Within this review we aim to highlight key features of
the presented algorithms or design approaches in a sequence of increas-
ing complexity in terms of the employed models or optimisation formu-
lations. Key features of the reviewed works are summarised in Table 1

3.2.1.  Pre-specified mixture compositions

Angelino and Colonna [150] investigated a ternary mixture with
pre-specified concentration, but it is worth mentioning because it was
one of the first studies incorporating an optimisation approach for the
ORC conceptual design. The optimisation enabled the identification of
important trade-offs between plant cooling power consumption and the
air-cooled condenser surface area.

Chys  et  al.  [151]  investigated  the  use  of  13  mixtures  in  a  recu-
perated ORC system for low-to-medium thermal-source temperatures.
They considered both binary and ternary mixtures, and they performed
the optimisation of the cycle parameters for every mixture. They used a
deterministic, non-linear programming algorithm (NLP). The cycle was
optimised for each binary mixture separately, and a third component
was  added  afterwards  in  the  tertiary  mixtures.  In  addition  to  the
optimisation, they performed a parametric evaluation of the thermal
efficiency and the net generated electricity of the optimum solutions.
The authors noted that the use of mixtures may lead to fractionation
(a  large  amount  of  one  component  in  the  liquid  phase  and  a  large
amount of the other in the vapour phase); mixtures that may exhibit
fractionation in the heat exchangers should be avoided. This is because
in  a  case  of  leakage  the  mixture  concentration  would  change  very
fast, with detrimental effects on system performance. This constraint
is commonly overlooked in current studies dealing with the assessment
of fluid mixtures for ORC applications. It is also recommended to avoid
linear interpolation of pure-fluid heat-transfer coefficients as a method
for mixture heat-transfer coefficient prediction, as the latter is often
smaller than what is predicted from linear interpolation.

Victor et al. [152] proposed the optimisation of the concentration of
pre-specified working fluids for a simple ORC system, using simulated
annealing (SA) as the optimisation algorithm. The concentration of the
pre-specified mixture compositions was the optimisation parameter.

Lecompte et al. [19] optimised the ORC operating conditions and
mixture  concentration  for  a  set  of  binary  fluids  with  pre-specified
fluid structures. After attaining the optimum results for given design
conditions, a parametric sensitivity analysis was performed where the
design  variables  were  re-optimised  for  variable  operating  conditions
and design assumptions. These included varying the heat-source tem-
perature, the pinch-point temperature difference, and the glide slope
of the cooling fluid. Based on the definition provided by the authors,
the term pinch-point temperature difference refers to the temperature
of  the  heat  carrier  at  the  point  of  minimum  temperature  difference
between working fluid and heat carrier.

Garg  and  Orosz  [153]  used  particle  swarm  optimisation  (PSO)
to optimise the concentration of 10 binary mixtures of pre-specified
components, together with several ORC operating parameters and the
condenser  area.  The  binary  mixtures  resulted  from  shortlisting  and
combining five pure components that exhibited optimum performance

when adopted as working fluids of the ORC system. The optimisation
was performed for all the binary mixtures considering a fixed power
capacity of the plant of 5 kW and a wide heat-source temperature range.
Kolahi et al. [154] investigated six binary mixtures of pre-specified
compositions for the optimisation of an ORC in a geothermal binary
flash cycle. Each mixture was evaluated, optimising the highest and
lowest ORC temperatures in their entire concentration range with a
coarse step change of 10 %. At the optimum ORC design solution, the
authors selected the concentration range where the mixtures exhibited
their highest performance in terms of power output, thermal efficiency,
exergy destruction, and exergy efficiency. In a subsequent optimisation
step, the concentration was treated as a continuous parameter, together
with the operating ORC parameters, to find the overall optimum design
of the ORC unit.

The  above  studies  included  thermodynamic  models  of  the  ORC,
which mainly consist of mass and energy balances. The calculation of
heat-transfer areas requires models for heat-exchanger (HEX) sizing. A
few such studies that are based on SOO formulations are reported be-
low. MOO fluid-mixture selection and ORC design approaches without
or  with  HEX  sizing  models  are  reported  subsequently.  This  classifi-
cation is performed here to highlight that some works include more
challenging  optimisation  problems  due  to  the  need  for  HEX  sizing.
Details regarding the modelling and the types of HEX are reported in
Section 3.4.2.

Heberle  and  Brüggemann  [155]  evaluated  several  mixtures  and
fluids in an ORC system at various temperatures within the range 80–
180 °C. The authors first identified the optimum operating conditions
and fluid concentrations of the cycle using the second-law efficiency as
an indicator. For a few selected highly performing mixtures, the authors
performed cycle simulations using a model for the heat exchangers that
included correlations for heat transfer.

Wang et al. [156] determined the concentration of several binary
mixtures  of  pre-specified  concentrations  through  optimisation  of  a
simple ORC. The goal was to evaluate the ORC performance of each
mixture considering different criteria, including the cycle network out-
put  with  or  without  leakage  and  the  carbon  footprint  of  the  cycle.
The  ORC  model  included  the  calculation  of  the  evaporator  area.  A
carbon-footprint model was employed to calculate the emissions during
cycle construction, operation, and decommissioning (including disposal
and recycling of materials and working fluids). A leakage model was
used  to  account  for  the  leak  rate  of  the  fluid  and  the  operation  of
the cycle with different amounts of the working fluid at different time
instants. Equilibrium models and correlations were used for the leakage
and carbon-footprint calculations, respectively. The PSO algorithm was
used for optimisation, implemented for all fluids considering one of the
three different criteria in each case. In this study the authors introduced
unconventional criteria related to the environmental performance of
the  cycle,  which  should  be  accounted  for  during  mixture  selection
or design.

Han et al. [157] investigated the performance of binary mixtures of
pre-specified compositions in an ORC system that was part of a geother-
mal flash cycle and a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser
that used the ORC power output for the production of hydrogen. In the

12

optimisation, the authors aimed to maximise the ORC power output
using  the  high  and  low  cycle  temperatures  and  binary-mixture  con-
centration (mass fraction of one component) as optimisation variables.
The PSO algorithm was implemented for each binary mixture. Through
this study the authors showed that working-fluid selection impacts the
design of the entire system where an ORC is used.

MOO formulations include the work of Feng et al. [158], who inves-
tigated the performance of a binary mixture in a simple ORC system,
considering  simultaneously  the  optimisation  of  the  mixture  concen-
tration and the ORC operating conditions. A MOO genetic algorithm
(GA) was used to derive Pareto-optimum solutions that simultaneously
maximised the exergetic efficiency and minimised the levelised energy
cost of the cycle. The authors initially implemented the optimisation
considering  four  different  cases  of  evaporating  and condensing  tem-
perature values. Alternatives that had the shortest distance from the
ideal solution were selected using the technique for order preference by
similarity to ideal situation (TOPSIS) [172]. For the optimum mixture
concentration and the two pure components of the mixture, the authors
fitted polynomials of the levelised energy costs as a function of exer-
getic efficiency for each model. They then compared the performance of
pure and mixed fluids and found that the performance of the mixture is
overcome by the pure fluids in some of the evaporating and condensing
temperatures explored.

In a follow-up study, Feng et al. [159] used the same optimisation
approach to evaluate the performance of a pentane-R245fa mixture.
In  addition  to  the  TOPSIS  technique  to  select  the  most  favourable
options from the generated Pareto front, they used the Shannon en-
tropy  technique  [173]  and  the  linear  programming  technique  for
multi-dimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) [174]. The authors
found that TOPSIS was the most efficient of the three. Finally, Tiwari
et  al.  [160]  investigated  four  mixtures  using  GA  in  a  straightfor-
ward  MOO  formulation,  deriving  useful  technical  insights  from  the
Pareto fronts.

In the case of MOO formulations, studies that address the sizing of
heat exchangers also exist. Andreasen et al. [161] used an ORC model
considering heat-transfer features in the heat exchangers to assess the
performance  of  three  fluids,  including  one  mixture  of  pre-specified
composition and concentration, separately. Although in this work the
mixture concentration and composition are pre-specified, it has some
interesting features. MOO was used to consider 11 cycle parameters as
design variables, including parameters pertaining to the internals of the
boiler and of the condenser (i.e., number of tubes, inner tube diameter,
and baffle spacing). The optimisation procedure was also interesting,
as the authors performed the calculations following a sequence that
included simulation without considering pressure losses, design of the
heat  exchangers,  and  simulation  with  pressure  losses  considered  to
facilitate the computational effort in view of the rigorous heat-exchange
models. The sequence was repeated in every iteration of the GA. An
unusually  large  population  number  of  30000  individuals  was  used,
possibly to address the multiple design parameters, several of which
are continuous.

Oyewunmi  and  Markides  [162]  optimised  a  simple  ORC  system
configuration  for  two  mixtures  of  pre-specified  composition,  where
predictions were performed using SAFT-VR. This is an important EoS,
as discussed in subsequent sections. An NLP algorithm was used for
optimisation. The cycle was optimised for all mixture concentrations,
including  the  pure-component  cases,  in 10 % intervals.  The  authors
initially used a single objective (net power output), whereas an MOO
implementation  was  further  used  (equipment  cost),  and  the  Pareto
fronts were presented.

Noriega Sanchez et al. [163] considered 28 mixtures of pre-defined
composition that were evaluated through an ORC system. The sizing
of  the  heat  exchangers  was  performed  using  the  logarithmic-mean
temperature-difference method (LMTD). Further discretisation was per-
formed of the pressure difference across the turbine in order to evaluate
the vapour quality and to ensure that no liquid will be formed, which

usually  results  in  corrosion.  The  mixture  concentration  was  one  of
the  optimisation  variables,  along  with  the  evaporation  pressure,  the
condensation temperature, and the minimum temperature difference
approach  in  the  evaporator.  The  net  power  output,  the  second-law
efficiency, and the size of the heat exchangers (represented as global
conductance-UA  values)  were  the  objective  functions.  The  NSGA-II
algorithm  was  implemented  using  a  large  population  and  executed
several times. The repeated executions revealed that for the selected
algorithmic parameters, the Pareto front changed insignificantly.

Nasir et al. [164] investigated a case of an ORC system that was
combined with a vapour-compression cycle (VCC), either using separate
condensers or using a shared condenser. The authors investigated single
working  fluids  for  both  the  ORC  and  the  VCC,  but  they  tested  12
different combinations, together with the optimisation of both cycles.
The latter were optimised in terms of 11 operating parameters, so the
problem was challenging due to the increased model size (ORC and
VCC) and the number of design variables.

Rodriguez-Sotomonte et al. [165] investigated the performance of
an ORC in power and cooling cogeneration plant, considering a few
different fluids. An interesting feature of this work was that the authors
determined the number of individuals used in the GA through a 3k
factorial design of the design variables. The LINMAP approach was used
to select designs from the Pareto fronts.

The models used to size the heat exchangers during optimisation
have significant differences in the employed heat transfer correlations.
In most of them correlations are used that include the Nusselt number
but use different overall forms of the correlations (e.g., with different
coefficients).  Furthermore,  some  works  model  only  few  of  the  heat
transfer phenomena, whereas other works provide more comprehensive
models. For example, Wang et al. [156] use a formula only for the
single-  phase  heat  transfer  in  the  shell  side,  whereas  Heberle  and
Bruggemann [155] additionally provide correlations for the evapora-
tion of pure working fluids on a plain tube considering pool boiling
and  for  the  condensation  of  a  pure  working  fluid  in  plain  tubes.  In
addition to using different models, the optimisation studies also often
use different objective functions (see Table A.1 in Appendix). Therefore,
the results are only valid for the specific heat exchangers under inves-
tigation in each case and the specific assumptions made. The effects of
different heat transfer correlations in heat exchanger model predictions
and ORC performance are further discussed in Section 3.4.3.

3.2.2.  Derivation of mixtures from pure components

In  this  section,  we  discuss  studies  in  which  the  mixture  compo-
sition (number and type of fluids in the mixture) and concentration
(amount  of  components  in  the  mixture)  are  design  variables.  In  all
cases, the mixture compositions are derived from a list of pre-specified
pure components.

Micheli  et  al.  [166]  investigated  various  siloxane  mixtures  in  a
regenerative  ORC  system,  aiming  to  identify  the  optimum  mixture
composition and concentration. An initial set of 11 pure components
was searched freely by an evolutionary algorithm. As the optimisation
search proceeded, components that exhibited zero concentration were
gradually excluded until, eventually, 11 binary and five ternary mix-
tures were shortlisted as promising options. The off-design assessment
was also performed for a randomly selected pure component. In this
case, the turbine was modelled using the Stodola ellipse method [175],
allowing both the efficiency and expansion ratio to vary with the load.
The evaporator and condenser pressures were the design variables.

Andreasen et al. [167] identified the optimum mixture composition,
concentration,  and  ORC  operating  conditions,  in  a  work  where  pre-
specified  pure  components  were  combined  into  binary  mixtures  by
the optimisation algorithm. Mixtures of up to five components of pre-
specified compositions and concentrations were also included in the
database and compared with the designed binary mixtures. Optimisa-
tion results for the ORC were reported for each mixture (for either the
designed binary options or the pre-specified options). When the binary

13

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

mixture  composition  and  concentration  were  optimisation  variables,
the mixture composition identified in up to 500 generations of the GA
was kept fixed for another 200 generations, where the concentration,
the turbine inlet state, and the hot-fluid outlet temperature were op-
timised. This approach was followed because, as noted, the optimum
results varied at different executions of the GA. To facilitate the search,
when a mixture exhibited lower performance than that of its pure-fluid
constituents, it was removed from the list. The ORC model accounted
for both subcritical and supercritical conditions. The discretisation of
the  boiler  (pre-heater,  evaporator,  and  superheater)  was  coarse  for
subcritical  pressures,  as  the  pinch  point  could  be  easily  located  at
the saturated-liquid point. When the pressure of the resulting design
solution was close to or higher than supercritical, the optimisation of
the cycle and the mixture concentration was performed again using a
higher number of segments in the boiler to improve the accuracy of the
pinch point prediction.

Molina-Thierry  and  Flores-Tlacuahuac  [168]  proposed  the  simul-
taneous blend (i.e., mixture) selection and ORC system design in an
NLP formulation, testing several different objective functions in inde-
pendent  SOO  problems.  The  number  of  working  fluids  participating
in  the  mixture,  the  type  of  working  fluids  that  formed  the  mixture,
and the mixture concentration were optimised together with the ORC
operating  conditions.  The  working  fluids  that  were  used  to  attain
mixture combinations were selected from a pre-specified set of 3, 11 or
6 pure fluids in the performed case studies. The results in the different
objective  functions  indicated  mainly  binary  or  ternary  mixtures  as
optimum solutions.

Satanphol  et  al.  [169]  developed  a  mixture-selection  and  ORC-
design  approach,  where  the  mixtures  were  generated  and  selected
from a pool of 24 pure components. A maximum of six components
were  allowed  in  the  mixture,  and  the  optimisation  algorithm  freely
varied the mass flow rate of each component, together with the ORC
design variables. Each time that the mass flow rate of one component
was reduced to zero, that component was replaced with another one
from the pool. Two quaternary mixtures were shortlisted as optimum,
and their pure constituents were used to generate binary and ternary
mixtures.  Indeed,  it  was  observed  that  at  least  one  ternary  mixture
could outperform the quaternary mixture from which it was generated.
The  ORC  model  was  not  based  on  the  simultaneous  solution  of  all
the equations, as in Molina-Thierry and Flores-Tlacuahuac [168], but
in  a  tear-stream  approach.  Internally  to  the  sequentially  quadratic
programming (SQP) optimisation algorithm used here, two loops were
used to ensure the ORC model convergence. These included a procedure
for the determination of the upper bound on the evaporator pressure
to avoid the assumption of setting it to the critical temperature of the
pure constituent with the highest value. The procedure further included
a gradual increase of the evaporation temperature until convergence
could not be achieved in the corresponding flash.

Lee and Mitsos [170] developed a mixture selection and ORC op-
timisation  approach  in  order  to  recover  the  maximum  exergy  from
an LNG stream. A total of 1771 mixtures of up to three components
were derived from a pool of 23 pure components. The presence or not
of a pure component in the mixture was represented through binary
variables,  whereas  three  continuous  variables  represented  the  com-
ponent concentrations in the mixture and the condensation pressure.
The condenser was discretised in 100 segments. The area minimisation
between the hot- and cold-temperature curves was used as the objective
function  instead  of  minimising  the  exergy  loss  because  the  entropy
calculations were avoided, and the problem could be solved faster. A
hybrid algorithm (Fig. 8) was used comprising a GA to initially handle
the  MINLP  problem  formulation.  The  mixture  composition  attained
from the GA was then used in a subsequent NLP formulation which
included the two mixture concentrations and the condenser pressure
as design variables. This was done in order to improve the solution
attained from the GA with respect to the continuous variables. It was
noted that multiple executions of the GA resulted in the same solution

with respect to the integer variables (i.e., the mixture composition).
The NLP was decomposed into several subproblems where constraints
were added gradually to provide good starting points for the subsequent
subproblem, until the entire problem was solved. Specific focus was
placed on avoiding trivial solutions of the cubic EoS. BARON [176]
was used in the NLP stage. The authors noted that although the NLP
methodology solved the problem globally, the decomposition approach
did not provide global optimality.

Whereas  in  all  the  above  works  SOO  formulations  were  used,
Bernal-Lara and Flores-Tlacuahuac [171] extended the previous work
of Molina-Thierry and Flores-Tlacuahuac [168] towards incorporating
rigorous heat-exchanger models in a MOO formulation. The authors
considered  10  pure  working  fluids,  which  were  used  freely  by  the
algorithm to generate multi-component mixtures and any concentra-
tion. The goal was to optimise the cycle thermal efficiency and total
annualised costs simultaneously.

3.2.3.  Key observations

Tables 1 and A.1 (in the Appendix) indicate that mixture-selection
approaches  where  the  components  of  the  mixture  are  pre-specified,
considered  very  few  options.  On  several  occasions,  the  authors  pre-
selected  the  mixtures  from  literature  sources,  mainly  using  criteria
pertaining to their GWP and ODP etc. In the case where the mixtures
were derived from pure components, Lee and Mitsos [170] indicated
that a much larger number of 1771 mixtures can be generated, hence
significantly increasing the possibilities of identifying a suitable fluid
for the requirements of a particular application. CAMD approaches can
be  much  more  efficient  as  they  may  generate  and  assess  billions  of
molecular structures.

Among the employed optimisation algorithms, it appears that SA,
GA, and PSO have been used more frequently because they are easy to
attain (e.g., through commercial software such as MATLAB) or to imple-
ment. These metaheuristic algorithms can avoid local minima, enable
derivative-free optimisation, and are suitable for problems where the
lack of information, noise, non-smoothness, and discontinuities prohibit
the use of deterministic methods, as noted in Boukouvala et al. [177].
The  same  authors  note  that  metaheuristic  algorithms  can  be  used
with black- or grey-box models and in cases where large systems of
partial differential equations are coupled with nonlinear correlations
to represent systems including design aspects, heat transfer, fluid dy-
namics, etc.  These  are  useful  features  for  ORC  systems  design,  and
in the future, such algorithms could be used to introduce models of
high resolution in the simulations (e.g., turbine CFD). The downside of
such algorithms is that repeated executions result in a distribution of
locally optimum solutions. They could, therefore, be used to shortlist a
few promising solutions out of millions of options, which can then be
explored more rigorously. Apparently, they are not appropriate if the
optimum solution is desired with first- or second-derivative guarantees,
although they can be combined with deterministic algorithms to attain
guarantees for the NLP part of the problem, as in Lee and Mitsos [170].
Another downside is that metaheuristic algorithms often include multi-
ple control parameters and require large populations in order to attain
convergence [161]. The determination of the algorithmic parameters
should also follow a certain, rigorous procedure in order to be able
to statistically assess the quality of the optimum solution [178]. Such
issues are important, but they were not addressed in most reviewed
implementations, where the control parameters were defined arbitrar-
ily. The factorial design of Rodriguez Sotomonte et al. [165] was an
interesting exception. The time-consuming performance of such algo-
rithms is largely due to the lack of mechanisms to avoid revisiting the
same design points. More-advanced implementations exploit records of
past solutions to skip the re-evaluation of the expensive model when a
design point was simulated at a previous instant [179].

Deterministic  algorithms  provide  mathematical  guarantees  about
local  or  global  optimality  within  finite  runtime.  Relaxations  of  the

constraints are used in global algorithms (e.g., branch-and-bound ap-
proaches) until a desired tolerance is reached [180]. Their execution
is  faster  than  metaheuristics  because  they  exploit  gradient  informa-
tion, as opposed to a random search. Lee and Mitsos [170] provided
very useful insights regarding optimisation strategies that can be used
with such algorithms in ORCs. They proposed the gradual addition of
constraints in the calculations in order to generate starting points for
the  solution  of  the  subsequent  problem  with  more  constraints  until
the full problem is solved. They noted that such strategies facilitate
algorithmic  execution,  but  global  optimality  cannot  be  guaranteed
when they are used. These algorithms are not without challenges either,
as they require the identification of a feasible starting point, which is
usually done through multi-start strategies. Different starting points of-
ten result in a distribution of different locally optimum solutions when
non-convex, MINLP formulations are used [60]. The phase-equilibrium
calculations  may  also  introduce  discontinuities  in  the  constraints  of
the  phase-behaviour  and  other  numerical  issues  that  also  affect  the
non-linear solvers, irrespective of the type of optimisation algorithm
(metaheuristic or deterministic). An excellent discussion is presented in
Gopinath et al. [60], along with strategies to address such challenges.
In this study the authors address multiphase separation processes, but
the  discussed  approaches  are  very  relevant  to  ORCs.  In  Satanphol
et al. [169], the numerical solution of ORC models has been facilitated
through the use of tear-stream approaches in order to avoid the need for
simultaneous solution of large equation systems. In such approaches,
recycle streams are broken into an input and output stream, where an
iterative procedure allows the continuation of the calculations around
the units in the recycle loop until these streams match [181]. Although
these are easy to implement in simple ORC structures, their use in more-
advanced structures and in superstructure approaches is difficult. The
need to identify and use the non-trivial roots of the EoS is also very
important and should be considered in the area of ORCs [170].

In recent years, the incorporation of approximation algorithms in
deterministic approaches is becoming increasingly relevant [182]. Such
approaches are likely to enable the use of surrogates of high-resolution
models with deterministic algorithms. Huster et al. [180] presented an
algorithm where artificial neural network (ANN) models were fitted
for 20 different cases of pure-working-fluid–ORC model combinations
to  perform  thermo-economic  optimisation.  The  global  deterministic
algorithm MAiNGO [183] was used in both MOO and SOO formula-
tions.  Approximations  are  also  very  relevant  for  metaheuristic  algo-
rithms, where integrated material selection, process and controllability
assessment problems can be addressed efficiently [184].

Another important feature of the above studies is the use of MOO.
There  is  a  large  volume  of  publications  on  MOO  for  the  design  of
ORCs or the selection of pure fluids [185]. The evaluation of different
mixtures based on thermodynamic calculations includes indicators that
exhibit conflicting behaviour. For example, as the pure components of
binary mixtures move towards equal concentrations, the ORC exergy
efficiency increases, whereas the thermal efficiency decreases [141].
MOO can help select mixtures that exhibit optimum trade-offs. Insights
on the influence of mixture concentration may be unveiled, as a mixture
with the same composition may participate in a Pareto front at different
concentrations.  Opposing  trends  may  also  be  observed  in  economic
and thermal indicators or in economic and environmental, health, or
safety indicators. Several of the previously reviewed studies proposed
methods for the selection of Pareto solutions that exhibit the shortest
distance from an ideal point. An important feature of MOO approaches
that  has  been  overlooked  is  how  to  generate  Pareto  points  that  are
distributed evenly, and that approximate the Pareto front as efficiently
as possible. This is very challenging because the search space may be
nonconvex due to the underlying ORC models and integer variables.
The Pareto front itself may be discontinuous and non-convex. Important
algorithms that address such issues, such as the sandwich algorithm

with multi-level single linkage, have been developed and applied in
CAMD problems recently [186].

A cradle-to-grave analysis of ORC equipment and fluids was per-
formed by Wang et al. [156] to calculate the equivalent greenhouse-gas
emissions, also accounting for working-fluid leakage scenarios. Clearly,
issues of environmental, health, and safety impacts are very important
and should be accounted for during mixture selection or design. The
evaluation of such mixture properties is much more challenging than
for pure fluids because the former often exhibit non-ideal behaviour.
For  example,  mixtures  exhibit  minimum  or  maximum  flash  points,
i.e.,  flash  points  that  are  not  between  the  flash  points  of  the  pure
components [187]. Flash points are indicators of safety, and vapour–
liquid equilibrium calculations are needed for their prediction in the
case of mixtures. Liquid–liquid equilibrium calculations are also needed
to determine the solubility of mixtures in water in cases of leakage into
the environment. Frameworks for the incorporation of holistic sustain-
ability calculations in CAMD [100] and CAMPD [188] of solvents have
been developed that could also be used for ORC working-fluid selection
and system design.

Finally, it is worth discussing the work of Schwöbel et al. [148] and
the follow-up work of Preißinger et al. [216]. Although the authors
did not use optimisation algorithms or mixtures in these studies, the
key feature was the assessment of a database comprising 72 million
molecular  structures.  The  authors  applied  thermodynamic  filtering
criteria  and  initially  reduced  the  candidates  to  approximately  two
million options. After applying quantum-chemical calculations on those
options, they shortlisted 3174 fluids which were evaluated using ORC
simulations. While Schwöbel et al. [148]s used the cycle thermal effi-
ciency as a criterion, Preißinger et al. [216] employed a multi-criteria
approach where other aspects such as environmental impacts, toxicity,
and flammability were also considered. These studies are noteworthy
due  to  the  sheer  number  of  evaluated  molecules  as  well  as  due  to
the  use  of  advanced  thermodynamic  and  quantum-chemical  models.
The investigated molecules were part of the PubChem database, which
is available publicly. It is worth noting that the attainable structural
space  that  is  generated  through  CAMD  is  much  wider,  as  it  may
comprise up to billions of options [137]. With the use of optimisation
algorithms, it is not necessary to evaluate all options exhaustively. It
is sufficient to evaluate up to a few hundred thousand options [217]
in order to identify the molecular structure that optimally matches the
desired criteria.

3.3.  Fluid selection and optimum design of advanced ORC systems

In this section, we discuss different structural ORC and heat-recovery
options that go beyond conventional layouts and the systematic repre-
sentation approaches that are often used to derive and evaluate them.
Key features of the studies reviewed are summarised in Table 2 and
presented in more detail in Table A.2, in Appendix. Table A.2 contains
similar sections as those of Table A.1 in addition to details on the type
of ORC configuration (e.g., single, dual-loop, regenerative, etc.).

3.3.1.  Pre-specified ORC structures

In  this  section,  we  review  studies  that  include  pre-selected  ORC
structures with different pressurisation levels or separation of working-
fluid  streams,  to  name  but  a  few  options.  In  all  of  these,  multiple
different  fluids  are  considered  but  their  selection  is  not  part  of  the
optimisation problem formulation. The operating conditions of the ORC
structure are optimised for each one of the considered fluids.

Xi et al. [189] optimised a simple ORC and two regenerative ORC
configurations considering few pure fluids. The first configuration in-
cluded the single-stage regenerative ORC (SRORC), where part of the
vapour  at  the  turbine  outlet  circumvents  the  condenser  and  is  used
in a feed-water heater to preheat the remaining part of the working
fluid that has been condensed, before entering the evaporator. In this
configuration  one  pump  was  used  after  the  condenser  to  pump  the
liquid  to  the  feed-water  heater,  where  the  liquid  came  into  contact
with the vapour from the turbine. Another pump followed to drive the
overall liquid to the evaporator. In the dual-stage regenerative ORC
(DRORC), one stream was directed to the condenser after the turbine,
whereas two other vapour streams (instead of one in the SRORC) were
directed to two feed-water heaters, hence the system has three pumps.
The GA used for optimisation included deterministic selection, simple
arithmetic crossover and mutation, and an elite preservation strategy
as  operators.  Each  ORC  structure  was  optimised  separately  for  each
working fluid.

Woodland  et  al.  [190]  performed  operating  optimisation  of  ad-
vanced ORC system configurations (Fig. 9), even at transcritical con-
ditions, considering up to two unconventional mixtures. The ORC with
liquid-flooded expansion (ORCLFE) is a cycle where the expander is
flooded with a subcooled liquid in equilibrium with the working fluid
when the latter is expanded. The flooding liquid operates as a heat
source, helping to maintain a constantly high temperature during the
expansion,  bringing  it  closer  to  the  ideal  isothermal  expansion.  The
ORC  with  solution  circuit  (ORCSC)  uses  a  mixture  of  the  primary

working fluid and an absorbent with a high boiling-point difference.
The cycle exploits the temperature glide in the evaporator/ desorber
due to the use of the mixture to enable increased exergetic efficiency.
The absorbent is desorbed during the heat addition, hence enabling
an  almost  pure  working  fluid  to  be  expanded  in  the  turbine.  The
ORCLFE enables higher efficiency than the simple ORC, but a positive
displacement expander is needed. The ORCSC facilitates better capacity
control and can have lower working pressures than the typical ORC,
but its efficiency is lower. In terms of working fluids, investigations
should be performed to find more efficient options, as the cycles have
received  little  attention.  The  ORCSC  cycle  shares  common  features
with the operation of absorption refrigeration cycles (ammonia–water
is a typical fluid for such a cycle) hence similar fluid options may be
considered [218,219]. Despite the interesting features of these cycles,
additional  capital  expenditures  are  introduced  due  to  the  additional
equipment, whereas the separation and absorption processes in these
cycles need to be very efficient.

Walraven  et  al.  [191]  investigated  different  working  fluids  in  a
single-pressure recuperative and a double-pressure ORC configuration.
In  the  latter,  part  of  the  working  fluid  in  the  intermediate  pressure
level goes through the boiler and into the turbine, whereas the other
part is pre-heated at the intermediate pressure level and is then driven
to the higher pressure level before it is expanded in the turbine. The
operating  conditions  of  the  ORC  (e.g.,  temperatures,  pressures, etc.)
were  optimised  simultaneously  with  the  HEX  geometrical  character-
istics  (e.g.,  tube  lengths, etc.).  An  NLP  solver  was  used  [220]  with
automatic gradient differentiation [221]. The authors [222] mention
that  the  gradient-based  algorithm  using  finite-differencing  results  in
slow calculation and low accuracy. These issues were avoided by cal-
culating the gradients with automatic differentiation in reverse/adjoint
mode.  Multi-pressure  configurations  enable  higher  work  extraction
than single-pressure ones. The number of pressure levels, the type of
turbine used (e.g., expansion, induction), and their placement in the
multi-pressure cascade should be accounted for during optimisation as
they greatly affect the minimisation of exergy losses [194].

Sadeghi  et  al.  [209]  investigated  several  mixtures  of  up  to  five
components of pre-specified composition and concentration in a simple,
a parallel two-stage (PTORC) and a series two-stage ORC (STORC). The
PTORC includes separation and pressurisation of the saturated liquid
from the condenser into two pressure levels, using two pumps, prior
to  absorbing  heat  from  two  evaporators  placed  in  series.  The  high-
pressure  fluid  absorbs  heat  from  the  hot  fluid  that  enters  the  first

evaporator, whereas the low-pressure fluid absorbs heat in the second
evaporator from the heat source fluid that exits the first evaporator.
The two streams then enter the turbine where power is generated, and
one outlet stream is led to the condenser. In the STORC, the working
fluid  after  the  condenser  is  pressurised  to  the  low-pressure  level.  It
is then separated into two streams; one stream is led directly to the
turbine, whereas the other is pressurised to the high-pressure level and
then led to the turbine. The selection was performed in three stages. In
the first stage, a parametric analysis was performed with all fluids and
configurations, and the authors found that the STORC configuration is
the most efficient based on first- and second-law efficiency criteria. In
the second stage, specific STORC cycle parameters for all fluids were
varied, using the net power output and the turbine-sizing parameter
as cycle-performance criteria. The third stage included multi-objective
optimisation, using specific STORC cycle parameters as design variables
for mixture R32/R125/R134a, and the two criteria of the second stage
as objective functions. It was observed that the STORC configuration
with  the  selected  fluid  enables  the  highest  power  output  with  the
second-lowest turbine size.

Theamtat and Koonsrisuk [192] investigated different working flu-
ids in subcritical, supercritical, and trilateral cycles. The latter is an
advanced  layout  where  the  working  fluid  enters  the  expander  in  a
saturated-liquid instead of a saturated-vapour state. A two-phase expan-
sion occurs, reducing the heat-rejection requirements at the condenser.
In all cases, the golden-section search algorithm was used to identify a
locally optimum solution for the working fluid flow rate that maximised
the work output.

Wang  et  al.  [213]  investigated  a  dual-loop  ORC  considering  dif-
ferent  working-fluid  mixtures  for  the  low-temperature  (LT)  and  the
high-temperature (HT) loops. In the dual cycles, heat is extracted firstly
in the HT loop and then in the LT loop. An internal heat exchanger
acts as the condenser of the HT loop, where the fluid of the LT loop
is pre-heated after the pump. An MOO approach was used with the
NSGA-II algorithm, using the TOPSIS technique to identify the optimum
solution.  Thermal,  economic,  and  environmental  criteria  (emissions)
were used in the optimisation. Gray relational analysis was further used
to identify the optimum pair of fluid mixtures for the two cycles.

Emadi et al. [193] investigated a dual ORC configuration to exploit
the heat from a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a gas turbine (GT)
(Fig. 10). In this cycle, all the heat is extracted from the HT evapo-
rator (ORC1), whereas its condenser acts as the LT evaporator (ORC2

evaporator). An MOO approach was used with GA as the optimisation
approach. ANNs were used to generate a model of the SOFC–GT–ORC
that  facilitated  the  implementation  of  the  GA.  The  time-consuming
simulations of the rigorous SOFC–GT–ORC model where thus avoided.
The LINMAP technique was used to select the optimum solution from
the  generated  Pareto  front.  The  combination  of  two  different  fluids
for the top (R601) and bottom (ethane) cycle resulted in the optimum
trade-off between efficiency and cost.

3.3.2.  Design of ORC structures

The  previous  section  included  studies  where  the  ORC  configura-
tion was pre-determined, and an optimisation algorithm was used to
further  determine  the  optimum  operating  conditions.  In  this  section
we  consider  studies  in  which  the  ORC  configuration  itself  is  a  de-
sign  variable,  and  the  optimisation  algorithm  is  used  to  guide  the
search  towards  structural  features  that  optimise  a  performance  in-
dicator. In these cases, superstructure-based approaches (e.g., [210])
may  include  pre-determined  structural  options  which  are  activated
or  deactivated  during  the  search.  There  are  also  superstructure-free
approaches (e.g., [196] or [198]), where the optimisation  algorithm
adds or removes options, and the ORC structure evolves and results
from the optimisation search. There are a few such works, and hence
the superstructure-free approaches are discussed here even if there is
no selection of working fluids.

Stijepovic et al. [194] proposed a generic approach for the design
of multi-pressure ORC networks, built on a mathematical representa-
tion  of  the  exergy  composite  curves  approach  [223].  This  approach
is  an  extension  of  the  original  Pinch  analysis  method  [224]  where
temperature-enthalpy diagrams of the heat source fluid and the work-
ing  fluid  represent  the  composite  curves  and  determine  the  amount
of  heat  that  is  available  for  recovery  from  the  heat  source.  In  the
exergy composite curves, the temperature is replaced by the Carnot
factor (1 − T0∕T ). The area between the heat source fluid curve and

the enthalpy axis in the Carnot factor-enthalpy diagram represents the
maximum work that can be generated, whereas the area between the
heat source fluid and working fluid composite curves corresponds to
the exergy loss or the ideal work equivalent lost in heat transfer. With
the proposed representation (Fig. 11) the authors could determine the
optimum configuration of the heat-exchange operations between the
external pressure loop and the heat source and between the internal
heat-exchange processes within the different pressure loops. Expansion
and induction turbines were design options, with the latter enabling
different pressure loops to be contacted. The number of pressure levels
could be increased if the addition of a new level improved the per-
formance  of  the  previous  one.  An  induction  turbine  is  essentially  a
layout that may be represented as single stage turbine units connected
in series. The working fluid vapour from the high-pressure evaporator
first flows into the high-pressure turbine and the pressure decreases to
the low-stage evaporation pressure. The exhaust from the high-pressure
turbine and the vapour from the low-pressure evaporator flow into the
low-pressure turbine together, and the vapour pressure decreases to the
condensation pressure [225].

Toffolo  [196]  presented  an  approach  for  the  synthesis  of  ORC
systems, where the ORC is represented through two basic components,
an  expander,  and  a  compressor,  allowing  for  interruptions  (thermal
cuts) between them in the cycle path. The thermal cuts represent the
heat-transfer  processes  within  the  cycle  components  or  between  the
cycle  components  and  the  environment.  The  optimisation  algorithm
may freely select the optimum number of thermal cuts and basic com-
ponents, allowing for stream splitting and mixing, different temperature
and pressure levels, and numbers of basic cycles. This was called the
HEATSEP  method  (Fig.  12)  and  was  based  on  the  original  work  of
Lazzaretto and Toffolo [226] for the synthesis of thermal processes.
Toffolo further proposed a two-level formulation of the optimisation
problem.  Externally,  he  showed  how  to  model  the  structural  design
options within the operations of an MOO evolutionary algorithm such

as GA, indicating how a move between states of the algorithmic op-
erations  represents  a  change  in  the  structure  of  the  designed  ORC.
Internally,  for  every  generated  structure,  he  proposed  the  use  of  an
SQP  to  identify  the  optimum  operating  conditions  of  the  structure.
The implementation of the algorithm in a case study resulted in multi-
pressure cycles that comprised various dependent loops, where the flow
of  the  working  fluid  might  be  split  and  mixed,  whereas  heat  might
be  drawn  at  different  cycle  points.  The  work  was  further  extended
to  the  SYNTHSEP  framework  [197]  where  rules  were  proposed  for
the  framework  of  Toffolo  [196]  to  allow  for  the  implementation  of
reasonable thermal cuts in the generated structures.

Wang et al. [198] further proposed a rule-based approach for the
generation of structural options during ORC system optimisation. The
approach  was  based  on  the  hierarchical  imposition  of  rules,  imple-
mented through a mutation operation in an evolutionary optimisation
algorithm. The latter was used to handle the discrete structural design
variables, whereas, for each generated ORC structure, an NLP was used
internally to optimise the continuous parameters. A notable feature of
this work is that the authors discussed algorithmic convergence issues
in the form of repeated execution of the evolutionary algorithm and
the determination of optimality gaps. The work was extended by Wang
et al. [199] to account for MOO.

Lee  et  al.  [210]  proposed  a  superstructure  of  a  cryogenic  ORC,
which included several different alternatives such as multi-stream cryo-
genic heat exchangers, vapour flashes, multi-stage turbines, and vapour
re-condensation processes. All these were pre-specified in the super-
structure, and the GA algorithm could freely select different options.

Huster  et  al.  [200]  presented  a  superstructure  approach  for  the
design of ORCs that included various options, such as multiple pres-
sure levels, additional superheating options, direct expansion from the
higher to the lower pressure levels, omitting intermediate pressures and
turbine  bleeding.  The  heat  sources  could  also  be  used  in  sequential
or parallel modes (split into different streams). A key feature of this
work was the use of ANNs for the prediction of the thermodynamic
properties of the working fluid. Furthermore, the authors reduced the
attainable  design  space  by  introducing  logical  propositions  to  ratio-
nalise  the  selection  of  different  options  and  employed  appropriate
relaxations and constraints to facilitate the optimisation solver, while a
parallel version of the optimisation algorithm was also used. Through
the  proposed  approach,  they  managed  to  reduce  the  computational
effort by 49 % using relaxations, in a superstructure that included 28
structural, integer combinations.

In all the previous works systematic approaches were presented for
the design of advanced ORC configurations, which were implemented
for one fluid. In the approaches reported below superstructures were
employed where both the fluid and the final ORC configuration are
selected from a set of available options.

Kermani  et  al.  [201]  proposed  a  superstructure  that  enables  the
selection of multiple different pressure levels, the addition of all the
basic components of an ORC system at each level and the type of fluid
that is used, out of a number of options. The problem again was solved
at two levels, where a GA was used externally and mixed-integer linear
programming  (MILP)  internally.  Contrary  to  the  previous  works,  it
appears that the GA handled mainly the continuous variables, whereas
the  discrete  variables  were  handled  by  the  MILP.  SOO  and  MOO
formulations were further tested with different objective functions.

Bao et al. [202] proposed a superstructure for a three-stage con-
densation ORC that used the LNG cold energy. The working fluid was
split into three streams after the expansion and was condensed at three
temperature levels. After that, the fluid streams could be compressed in
parallel pumps (parallel arrangement) prior to being mixed and enter-
ing the evaporator. Another alternative was to compress two streams
in  parallel  and  then  mix  them  with  the  third  stream  and  compress
the  final  stream  (partial  parallel  arrangement).  The  final  alternative
was to compress the first stream, then mix it with the second stream,
compress  the  output  and  then  mix  this  with  the  third  stream  and
compress it (serial arrangement). Similarly, the superstructure could
include parallel, partial parallel, and serial expansion. In the first case,
the evaporator outlet was split and expanded using three turbines. In
the partial parallel arrangement, the fluid was first expanded in one
turbine and was then split into three streams that flowed in the partial
parallel arrangement of the condensers. In the serial arrangement, after
expanding all the fluid in one turbine, it was divided into two streams,
one  of  them  flowing  in  the  first  condenser,  whereas  the  other  was
expanded in another turbine and was further divided into two streams
prior to entering the two final condensers. The superstructure included
nine structural options, which were represented by three ternary, dis-
crete variables for the different configurations of the expansion and the
compression processes. Each working fluid, out of 12 options, was also
a binary variable. This superstructure was also optimised using GA.

Lin  et  al.  [214]  combined  the  HEATSEP  representation  of  Tof-
follo [196] to select pure fluids and mixtures out of a set of pre-specified
options. They used a similar solution approach to most of the previous
studies, where an external evolutionary algorithm handled the discrete
and  binary  structural  and  fluid  option  variables,  whereas  the  ORC
simulation was performed through an internal deterministic algorithm.
The proposed work was implemented in a two-stage condensation ORC
for LNG cold energy exploitation.

3.3.3.  Integration of heat sources

The  heat  that  is  provided  to  the  ORC  may  come  from  various
systems  that  have  different  flows,  operate  at  different  temperatures
or  pressures  and  that  simultaneously  serve  different  purposes  in  an
industrial or other site. The exchange of energy among such systems
and the ORC needs to result from a design approach that is able to
systematically capture and exploit all the interactions. In this section,
we  consider  studies  in  which  the  heat  source  is  integrated  through
systematic approaches with the ORC in order to improve the overall
system  performance.  Often  such  approaches  enable  the  design  of  a
heat-recovery network which can be integrated with simpler or more-
complex ORC configurations. Hipólito-Valencia et al. [203] proposed
a superstructure-based approach for the design of the utility network
that is used in a regenerative ORC (Fig. 13). The work was extended by
Hipólito-Valencia et al. [227] in cases of inter-plant heat integration of
utility networks, to serve either individual or shared regenerative ORCs.
The work was further extended by Lira-Barragán [205] in the design of
tri-generation systems. In this case, the utility superstructure was used
to design a network that simultaneously served an ORC, a steam RC,
and an absorption-refrigeration system.

Similarly  to  the  previous  study,  Chen  et  al.  [204]  employed  a
superstructure to design a utility network. The first stage included the
design of the utility network structure, and the second stage involved
the design of the ORC for this structure.

Soffiato et al. [215] developed an algorithm that used the HEATSEP
representation of Toffollo [196] and comprised three stages. The heat
composite curves of the boiler-heat source were first calculated for a
given set of design variables for the ORC, the latter was simulated, and
the algorithm calculated the cold composite curves at the condenser.
The mass flow rate of the working fluid was increased until the mini-
mum temperature difference was reached at the boiler-heat source and
condenser-cold sink sides. The net work output of the ORC was then
generated, and the algorithm continued until a value for the working-
fluid  flow  rate  was  found  that  violated  the  heat-transfer  feasibility
constraints at the hot and cold sides. The algorithm was implemented
separately for each ORC configuration and fluid.

Yu et al. [206] further proposed an approach for the simultaneous
design of the utility network and of the ORC operating conditions and
equipment sizes. A major contribution was the use of the mathematical
formulation of the pinch-based model of Duran and Grossmann [228],
where the use of fixed temperature intervals is avoided in the design
of the utility network.

Elsido et al. [207] proposed an optimisation approach for the design
of complex ORC configurations and the corresponding utility network.
The work was based on the generic superstructure of Elsido et al. [229].
The  superstructure  could  capture  multi-pressure  cycles  with  turbine
bleeding,  saturated,  superheated,  reheated,  or  regenerative  options,
combined heat and power cycles, condensing and non-condensing tur-
bines,  import  and  export  of  liquid  or  vapour  streams,  subcooling  of
the evaporator inlet, deaerators or desuperheaters, etc. The work was
focused on the efficient solution of the challenging MINLP formulation
through a decomposition approach that included outer-approximation
linearisation, McCormick relaxations, and adaptive piecewise lineari-
sation of the cost functions. The problem was essentially decomposed
into an MILP master and an NLP subproblem.

Marechal and Kalitventzeff [208] developed an approach based on
exergy composite curves for exploiting the external heat and cooling
utilities while designing an optimum ORC. The exergy curves allowed
the  targeting  of  the  mechanical  production  potential  from  a  set  of
heat-source streams. In the first stage, an MILP problem was solved to
identify the temperature levels of the external utilities that minimised
the exergy losses. Based on these temperature levels, the second stage
included the design of ORC configurations together with the identifica-
tion of the desired working fluid from a list of pre-determined options,
with the aim again to minimise the exergy losses. In the third stage,
an MILP problem was further solved to minimise the cost of the ORC

system from the list of options available from Stage 2. The approach
essentially enabled the gradual addition of constraints in the exergy
composite curves of a process.

Stijepovic  et  al.  [195]  proposed  the  integration  of  multiple  heat
sources  of  different  temperatures  into  a  superstructure,  which  can
enable the simultaneous design of multiple cycles that share the heat-
extraction section and the cooling utility, the design of the hot-utility
network, and the selection (number and type) of the working fluid. The
approach was based on the mathematical representation of the utility
requirements through pinch analysis tools and the use of optimisation.
A key finding was that when a dual (or higher) ORC cascade is the
optimum  solution,  each  one  of  them  may  operate  with  a  different
working fluid.

Scaccabarozzi et al. [211,212] presented an optimisation-based ap-
proach, where the concentration of different binary mixtures of pre-
specified composition was optimised simultaneously with the cycle and
the heat source. The ORC system was used to recover heat from an
internal combustion engine. The PGS-COM evolutionary algorithm was
used  to  maximise  the  cycle  power  output  and  efficiency.  PGS-COM
is  a  derivative-free  algorithm  for  non-smooth  constrained  black-box
models.  For  each  set  of  design  variables  that  was  generated  by  the
algorithm, the ORC model determined the stream temperatures. The

working-fluid mass flow rate was then optimised to maximise the heat
recovery from the heat source. The heat cascade methodology was used
for this purpose in the form of a linear programme [230], where the
ORC system flows and the mass flow rates of the external utilities were
used  as  optimisation  variables.  The  execution  of  the  PGS-COM  was
repeated five times to assess the quality of the optimum solution.

3.3.4.  Key observations

The reviewed studies indicate that there are multiple ORC config-
urations  that  need  to  be  considered  prior  to  selecting  the  one  that
exhibits  the  optimum  system  performance.  Approaches  that  enable
the automated generation of such structures during optimisation are
very important because the optimum results are highly dependent on
both  the  employed  working  fluid  and  the  availability  of  heat  and
cooling utilities. The approaches that integrate the design of the utility
network  and  of  the  ORC  structure  indicate  that  it  is  also  important
to recover the heat and cooling resources within optimum networks.
The consideration of working-fluid selection as part of the integration
of ORC systems with multiple heat-source streams or heat-exchanger
networks has been very limited to date, and only small sets of pre-
defined fluids have been considered in ORC integration studies. The
studies in which limited fluid-selection options are considered as part

21

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

of  ORC  design  and  system  integration  serve  as  a  demonstration  of
the importance of integrated approaches to simultaneous cycle design,
integration, and fluid selection. Similarly, while promising results have
been reported in early studies, the simultaneous selection and design of
working-fluid mixtures in heat-recovery-network design have received
little attention to date.

Such approaches and their extensions to consider working-fluid de-
sign for both single fluids and mixtures constitute a promising direction
for future research. However, as the optimisation problem is extended
from the simultaneous selection of fluids and design of ORC structures
to one that also requires the design of the corresponding heat-exchanger
networks,  the  complexities  incurred  by  the  optimisation  algorithms
further increase. Huster et al. [200] and Elsido et al. [207] discussed
the challenges in the development of efficient deterministic algorithms
for global optimisation of such systems. Approaches that include meta-
heuristics to handle the discrete variables and deterministic algorithms
to handle the continuous variables have been quite popular, as shown
in the Appendix (Table A.2). In such cases, it is important to perform
different executions and fine-tune the algorithmic parameters in order
to be able to assess the quality of the solutions.

Other than considering advanced and efficient optimisation algo-
rithms, it is also important to exploit insights that are provided by the
phase behaviour of the fluids to avoid examining options (e.g., working
fluid candidates or ORC structural options) that may have detrimental
effects on the ORC costs. For example, the shape of the temperature-
entropy curves changes for different working fluids, resulting in their
classification  as  wet,  dry  or  isentropic.  Györke  et  al.  [104]  noted
that based on these fluid types different ORC structures or equipment
may be necessary to avoid the appearance of liquid or of superheated
vapour  in  the  expander  outlet.  The  former  increases  the  equipment
maintenance costs, whereas the latter increases the cooling utility costs.
They further showed that this classification is not sufficient to predict
the phase of the fluid after expansion and proposed up to 32 poten-
tial  categories  to  ensure  that  all  potential  fluid  phase  outcomes  can
be attained. In combination with this classification approach, Györke
et al. [231] developed a rule of thumb, based on a correlation related
to molar isochoric specific heat capacity of saturated vapour states, to
identify dry or isentropic fluids out of a database of 74 options. Imre
and Groniewsky [232] applied the new classification to identify such
fluids out of 30 options and mainly for cryogenic applications, within
different upper and lower expansion temperature limits. The proposed
approach was also extended to selection of working fluids for trilateral
flash  cycles  [232].  Groniewsky  et  al.  [233]  extended  the  proposed
approach  to  account  for  different  expander  efficiencies  and  source–
sink temperatures that may be relevant for cryogenic, geothermal and
industrial waste-heat recovery applications. The authors also developed
a software that may select a working fluid from a database of 69 options
for different temperature ranges. Such an approach may be integrated
in ORC optimisation, introducing additional constraints and criteria to
reduce the optimisation effort and to result in highly performing fluids
and ORC systems.

Overall,  there  is  a  trend  to  formulate  increasingly  larger  design
problems to include a growing number of options  in terms of cycle
design, cycle integration with heat sources, and working-fluid selection,
as well as more-detailed equipment models in single, comprehensive
optimisation  models  that  become  increasingly  challenging  to  solve.
Research into problem-decomposition schemes, similar to the CAMPD
problem decomposition using MOO CAMD [217,234,235], may be a
promising direction for future research to enable the effective solution
of the envisaged larger problems.

An important issue here is the reliability and reproducibility of the
attained results. As the complexity of the ORC configurations increases
or  as  new  fluids  are  proposed  through  computational  approaches,
experimental validation is not easy because experimental data generally
exist for simpler configurations (Lecompte et al. [80] and well-known
working fluids, such as commercially available refrigerants [236,237].

Park et al. [236] indicate that experimental ORC layouts include mainly
basic cycle configurations where different expanders or working fluids
are tested. More complex experimental layouts are less frequent and
include the use of ORCs in trigeneration systems [238] or the testing
of multiple expanders in parallel [239]. The experimental testing of
more  advanced  systems  is  clearly  a  key  direction  for  future  work.
However, the motivation for building and testing experimental rigs of
more  advanced  systems  should  come  from  optimisation  studies  that
prove their economic and environmental benefits, as the capital costs
may often make them unappealing.

In view of the lack of experimental data, as a minimum requirement,
validations should be presented with experimental data of reference
fluids for simpler models that are used as the basis for the development
of more complex configurations. Additionally, all the details and data
used in the model equations should always be presented so that the
models may be reproduced. For design results that indicate improved
performance through more complex configurations or fluids for which
experimental data are not available, insights should always be provided
regarding  the  key  driving  forces  that  enable  performance  improve-
ments. An additional feature that could enhance the reliability of the
attained results is the consideration of uncertainty in various models,
parameters and correlations that are used. As discussed in Section 3.4.3
and 3.5, uncertainty significantly affects the attained results and the
ranking of the fluids. By using systematic methods to address it during
working fluid selection and ORC design, the results will become more
robust and likelier to closely match experimental outcomes.

3.4.  Fluid selection and rigorous equipment models

ORC performance improvements may be attained by designs that
focus on expander or heat-exchanger internals such as blade and pipe
geometries, to name but a few. The effects of the working fluids on
such designs are very pronounced, but the highly detailed models that
are  needed  result  in  challenging  design  problems.  There  are  several
studies in which such challenges have been addressed. Key features of
the reviewed studies are summarised in Table 3 and presented in more
detail in Tables A.3 (for expanders) and A.4 (for heat exchangers) in
the Appendix, where additional information is presented regarding the
modelling approaches and assumptions.

3.4.1.  Expanders

The expansion stage is absolutely critical in the achieved perfor-
mance  of  the  ORC  system.  A  variety  of  expansion  devices  can  be
employed  in  ORC  systems,  such  as  turbines  (with  radial  and  axial
configurations being the most-common options), positive-displacement
equipment (with scroll, screw, piston, and rotary vane expanders as
possible  and  common  alternatives),  and  ejectors  [282].  The  conver-
sion  of  the  potential  energy  (associated  with  the  total  pressure)  of
the working fluid upstream of the expander into either rotational or
linear displacement work, depending on the expander type (positive-
displacement or turbomachine) is closely related to the properties of
the  working  fluid.  Therefore,  the  design  of  the  expander  should  be
carefully considered with respect to the features and characteristics of
the working fluid. A series of recent studies incorporating investigations
of the interactions of working fluids with the expander design, the oper-
ating conditions prevailing in the expander, and the achieved expander
efficiency in combination with the overall ORC system thermodynamic
and economic performance are critically reviewed with the summary of
their approaches and conclusions shown in the Appendix (Table A.3).
Yue et al. [283] presented a model where the internal geometric
turbine and heat-exchanger features were considered. An axial flow tur-
bine was modelled considering rotor, blade, and nozzle characteristics.
Plate evaporator and condenser heat exchangers were also modelled
considering  plate  dimensions,  distances,  numbers,  and  materials  of
construction, to name but a few. An important observation was that
a zeotropic isobutane–isopentane mixture exhibited optimum thermal

performance at compositions that did not exhibit the maximum tem-
perature glide. Thus, proper accounting for equipment–working-fluid
interactions  is  crucial,  and  purely  thermodynamic  design  guidelines
lead to suboptimal performance.

Song et al. [279] pointed out that failure to accurately estimate the
turbine efficiency in ORC simulation calculations may lead to erroneous
results regarding the assessment of the performance of various working
fluids. In their work, a one-dimensional turbine-efficiency model was
integrated within the thermodynamic ORC model for the evaluation of
six working fluids. A breakdown into friction and leakage-related losses
for a wide range of operating conditions for each working fluid enabled
a reliable rank ordering of the investigated working fluids, in which
R123 exhibited the highest overall efficiency.

Fiaschi  et  al.  [242]  focused  on  the  radial-turbine  design  for  two
blade configurations and the accurate estimation of the losses for each
specific  design.  The  effect  of  key  design  parameters  such  as  blade
height, flow and load coefficients, and isentropic degree of expansion
on the geometric features of the expander were calculated for six single-
component  fluids.  An  explicit  mapping  of  working-fluid  and  radial-
turbine expander design and operating conditions was then derived. In
addition, a thorough analysis of the contribution of each loss factor in
the overall losses was performed for each working fluid under consid-
eration. Off-design studies for the two blade geometries were carried
out, examining the influence of corrected rotational speed on the gen-
erated power. Fluids with higher average density and lower volumetric
expansion, such as R134a and R1234yf, showed superior performance
in terms of expander efficiency under nominal operating conditions.

Rahbar et al. [243,244] aimed at the optimisation of a small radial
expander for ORC applications. Non-ideal gas behaviour was coupled
with a mean-line model for the expander. A GA was employed [243]
for the maximisation of the expander efficiency by calculation of a set
of operating (e.g., rotational speed, load and flow coefficient, degree
of  superheating  and  so  forth)  and  geometric  (e.g.,  rotor  exit  flow
angle, nozzle inlet to exit radii, rotor exit to inlet radii and so forth)
characteristics. An optimised expander tailored for the selected working

fluid could increase its efficiency by a maximum of 14.7 %, with R152a
resulting  in  the  highest  expander  efficiency  among  the  investigated
working fluids. R123a and R236ea achieved the smallest expander size.
White and Sayma [240] investigated 18 single components as work-
ing fluids in a 10 kWe system using a thermodynamic model for the
ORC  and  a  simplified  radial  expander  model.  The  optimisation  ap-
proach used an aggregate objective function with multiple terms aiming
at obtaining the optimal sizing of the ORC system equipment. Overall,
fluids R1234ze and R142b demonstrated the best performance, as re-
flected in the objective function value, while exhibiting a condensation
pressure below 3 bar.

Bekiloğlu et al. [241] screened 28 hydrocarbons based on their per-
formance on two objective functions: the total heat-exchanger area and
the maximum performance factor. Both objective functions considered
implicitly the economic cost for equipment purchase and installation
costs. A larger maximum performance factor indicated higher power
generation from a smaller turbine. An iterative radial-inflow turbine
design procedure was employed that determined the geometric features
of the turbine in order to achieve operation within a desired regime and
maintain the power losses due to friction and irregular flow patterns
contributing to pressure losses within an acceptable level. Therefore,
the direct impact of the working-fluid properties and behaviour was
taken into account.

Meroni  et  al.  [247]  investigated  the  employment  of  multi-stage
axial expanders for the evaluation of 11 working fluids. A sequence
of  optimisation  steps  that  considered  multiple  expander  stages  was
incorporated into the design procedure. For a conventional expander
design, the ideal turbine was characterised by a two-stage configuration
with  supersonic  converging  nozzles  and  post-expansion.  For  a  more
extreme  expander  design,  the  ideal  obtained  choice  was  a  single-
staged supersonic converging–diverging nozzle with an achieved Mach
number up to 2.

Lampe et al. [273] presented a holistic approach for the optimal
selection  of  working  fluids  in  ORC  systems  by  considering  a  CAMD
approach using group contribution and the PC-SAFT EoS to provide

23

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

the thermodynamic properties. A 1-D radial-expander model was in-
corporated  into  the  design  and  the  performance  simulation  of  the
ORC  system  for  each  working  fluid  that  was  generated  by  CAMD.
The optimisation framework offered an integrated approach that can
evaluate in a systematic way the interactions among the working-fluid
properties,  the  thermodynamic  features  of  the  overall  ORC,  and  the
aerodynamic conditions of the expander for a very large set of fluids.
Bahadormanesh et al. [280] investigated the impact of mechanical
vibrations  in  the  radial  expander  on  the  optimal  ORC  design  con-
sidering four pure organic refrigerants. The MOO approach that was
employed considered the thermal efficiency of the cycle and the per-
formance of the radial expander with respect to its size. The developed
tension and vibrations in the radial expanders were explicitly consid-
ered in the optimisation problem as constraints, and their impact on
the optimal solution was thoroughly explored. The trade-offs between
thermal efficiency and expander size enabled the calculation of superior
expander-design solutions.

Han et al. [249] and Li et al. [246] investigated the selection of
working fluids under both constant and variable turbine efficiencies.
Turbine  efficiency  may  change  due  to  variations  in  the  operating
conditions  induced  by  hot-source  temperature  drifting.  To  this  end,
a  turbine  model  accounting  for  losses  due  to  friction,  leakage,  and
other peripheral turbine features is absolutely necessary. Energy losses
based on the relative velocity ratio and, subsequently, the geometric
configuration of the turbine was estimated. Han et al. [249] consid-
ered  exergy  and  thermal  efficiency  in  addition  to  the  cost  per  kW,
whereas Li et al. [246] assessed exergy efficiency and total system cost,
both within a MOO framework. Optimal working-fluid selection was
influenced by the employed turbine-efficiency model. However, more-
realistic conditions were considered with the variable turbine-efficiency
approach. Han et al. [249] showed that cyclic and aromatic hydrocar-
bons were superior to chained hydrocarbons in performance, whereas
Li et al. [246] identified highly performing fluorohydrocarbons. Peng
et al. [263] compared the off-design performance of an ORC with a
transcritical CO2 power cycle in single-stage axial turbines. Mean-line
model and velocity triangles were used for the geometric design of the
axial turbines and the estimation of the off-design expander efficiency.
The CO2 power cycle exhibited a higher efficiency and improved ability
to cope with the off-design operation.

In  one  of  the  limited  number  of  studies  that  involve  a  detailed
multi-dimensional expander model, Gad-el-Hak et al. [270] employed
a numerical model that solved the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes
equations coupled with the k-ω turbulence model and a non-ideal EoS
for  the  prediction  of  the  thermodynamic  properties.  A  relationship
between isentropic efficiency and blade speed ratio was derived from
the numerical implementation of the experimentally validated radial
expander  model.  Zeotropic  mixtures  of  R600a/R245fa  at  some  con-
centrations showed an improvement in the efficiency in the range of
1.15 % to 1.6 %. Off-design operation increased the incidence losses in
the expander due to irregular incidence angles in the rotor. However,
the performance can be corrected to design levels by proper adjustment
of  the  nozzle  guide  geometry.  Wang  et  al.  [271],  through  a  similar
approach, compared the performance of R245fa and an R245fa/R134a
mixture  in  a  radial  expander  by  a  set  of  rigorous  CFD  simulations
and parametric sensitivity. Higher power output by more than 9 % and
isentropic efficiency by about 2.5 % were achieved with a lower mass
flow rate for the zeotropic mixture.

On a similar track, Jubori et al. [245] implemented rigorous sim-
ulation for the performance assessment of five organic fluids in low
temperature (< 100 °C) ORC systems. The investigation was performed
for  an  axial  and  a  radial  inflow  expander.  It  was  shown  that  the
key  operating  and  design  parameters  that  have  a  strong  impact  on
the  expander  performance  are  the  rotational  speed,  the  expansion
ratio  in  the  cycle,  the  associated  mass  flow  rate,  and  the  expander
size.  A  thermodynamic  model  and  a  mean-line  model  allowed  the
provision  of  the  geometric  characteristics  of  the  turbine,  whereas  a

CFD model enabled an accurate expander-performance prediction for a
wide range of the operational regime. Isopentane exhibited the highest
efficiency, and in general, the axial turbine was smaller in size than
the  radial-inflow  turbine.  Jubori  et  al.  [248]  extended  the  work  to
include  MOO  in  the  design  of  the  expander.  CFD  simulations  were
used in conjunction with a design space-filling technique to develop
a response surface that acted as the surrogate model for the expander
system. Nozzle and rotor-blade geometry, as defined by blade angle
and blade-thickness distributions, were optimised for isopentane and
R245fa based on efficiency and aerodynamic performance criteria. An
impressive enhancement of more than 10 % in the overall efficiency of
the expander was observed for both fluids. The optimal expander design
was subsequently incorporated into the overall ORC system design.

As the model detail for the expander increases, the complexity of
the optimisation problem becomes prohibitive from the computational
point  of  view.  The  latter  is  more  pronounced  when  working-fluid
selection decisions are to be determined. An approach to tackle such
a burden is the employment of simplified mathematical models that,
however,  encompass  the  fundamental  relations  and  interactions  be-
tween the key operating conditions and the performance indicators of
the ORC system for accuracy in predictions. Neural networks and other
data-driven  modelling  techniques  that  act  as  surrogate  models  have
been widely utilised in the optimisation of ORC systems [180,248,284,
285]. For example, Palagi et al. [284] considered the development of a
neural-network model that, apart from the thermodynamic ORC model,
included  a  detailed  model  for  an  in-flow  radial  expander.  Different
architectures were tested, including a shallow network with 20, 50 and
100 neurons in the hidden layer and a deep network with two hidden
layers, 30 neurons in the first layer and 10 in the second. The deep
network exhibited the lowest error in all the used training sets. The
neural-network model greatly facilitated the computational effort for
the optimisation. The approach was implemented for one working fluid.
Kim et al. [286] also developed a neural-network model for an in-flow
radial expander. The model was fitted using experimental data. A deep
network was used with two hidden layers. Different numbers of nodes
per layer were tested, ranging between 10 and 30. The highest accuracy
was attained when the first layer included 30 nodes and the second 10.
A single fluid was used here too. The use of such surrogate models for
the assessment of working fluids would require the development of as
many training data sets as the number of fluids under consideration. Of
critical importance is the accuracy of the developed data-based model,
which depended on the quality of the training data set.

3.4.2.  Heat exchangers

The heat-exchanger sizes are strongly dependent on working-fluid
properties, e.g., critical pressure, molecular weight, thermal conductiv-
ity, density, and the heat capacity [147]. The cost of heat exchangers in
an ORC is a significant part of the cycle capital cost, and this is reflected
in the proposed use of the ratio of ORC heat exchanger (HEX) area
to ORC net power to produce an economic performance metric [287].
Bernal-Lara and Flores-Tlacuahuac [171] show that this cost may be
up to 60%–70% of the total capital cost (with the rest being mainly
from the turbine) for low thermal efficiencies of 1%–2%, respectively. It
decreases to 45% for a thermal efficiency of 10%, with the contribution
of the turbine capital cost exceeding 50%. The modelling of HEXs as
part of ORC design has therefore received considerable attention. Both
shell-and-tube,  as  well  as  plate  HEXs,  have  been  modelled  in  ORC
studies. Key features of the HEX models used in different publications
are shown in the Appendix (Table A.4).

Heberle and Brüggemann [155] investigated a layout with a pre-
heater and evaporator, where the aim was to calculate the surface area.
All  the  geometric  parameters  of  the  HEXs  were  pre-specified.  Wang
et al. [156] investigated a layout with three zones in the evaporator
and  two  zones  in  the  condenser,  with  the  aim  of  determining  their
surface area. Details were not disclosed, but the employed heat-transfer
coefficient  correlation  indicates  that  a  shell-and-tube  type  HEX  was

24

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

assumed. Each HEX was discretised in 30 finite elements to calculate
heat  transfer  under  the  assumption  of  constant  properties  at  each
element. Andreasen et al. [161] provided more details about the heat
exchangers,  where  the  shell-and-tube  geometry  (including  angles  of
tubes in their relative positioning) was used to calculate their surface
area  and  pressure  drops.  Discretisation  in  30  control  volumes  was
performed in this case, too.

Oyewunmi and Markides [162] developed a model of shell-and-tube
HEXs with two zones in the boiler and the condenser. Heat-transfer
correlations were considered, with 100 segments of the variable size
used for each HEX. The calculations included pre-specified geometric
parameters and correlations for turbulent flow boiling of the mixtures.
Noriega Sanchez et al. [163] used the logarithmic-mean temperature
approach to determine the conductance and mentioned that the HEX
were discretised to perform the heat balances.

Among the researchers who included the determination of both the
mixture composition and concentration in their studies, few performed
HEX calculations. Satanphol et al. [169] used HEX models from ASPEN
Plus, assuming constant heat-transfer coefficients. Lee and Mitsos [170]
modelled  rigorously  only  the  condenser,  due  to  the  needs  of  their
application  on  LNG  cold-energy  recovery.  They  used  100  segments
in  the  problem  with  the  GA  solver  and  19  segments  in  the  final
subproblem of the NLP formulation (cf., Section 3.1). Bernal-Lara and
Flores-Tlacuahuac [171] calculated the surface area of the HEX, using
correlations in the shell and tube sides for the heat transfer and pressure
drops, for pre-specified geometric characteristics.

Studies are further reviewed that include the selection of pure fluids,
with  a  focus  on  cases  where  geometrical  characteristics  of  the  HEX
and  their  types  are  accounted  for.  Lecompte  et  al.  [250]  evaluated
different  pure  fluids  in  an  approach  where  the  optimum  part-load
and year-round operation of the ORC were determined in a step-wise
procedure. Pierobon et al. [251] presented a work where fluids from
a pre-specified set were used as options in an optimisation algorithm
that optimised the ORC and the geometric features of the HEX simulta-
neously. An MOO GA algorithm was used where 20 fluids were design
options, together with the condenser outlet pressure and pinch point,
the recuperator pinch point, the minimum temperature difference of
the economiser and the vaporiser, the turbine inlet pressure, the su-
perheating temperature difference and the target velocities in the tube
and shell sides of the HEX. These velocities were determined by using
the outer tube diameter, pitch, and baffle spacing as design variables in
a separate, simplex direct-search algorithm that provided an optimum
result for every vector of the ORC operating variables that was handled
by the GA.

Tian et al. [264] investigated the performance of a few mixtures
in  a  dual-loop  ORC,  where  the  geometric  features  of  the  employed
shell-and-tube  HEX  were  pre-determined.  The  number  of  tubes  was
manipulated  in  the  parametric  investigations  in  order  to  satisfy  the
pressure-drop constraint. Di Battista et al. [252] used a shell-and-tube
HEX  for  the  boiler,  a  plate-and-frame  HEX  for  the  recuperator,  and
a plate-and-tube HEX for the condenser. The latter was the same as
a  conventional  car  radiator.  The  plate-and-frame  HEX  enabled  low
minimum temperature approaches in smaller dimensions.

In  Li  et  al.  [281],  the  key  feature  was  the  method  for  the  eval-
uation  of  the  pressure  drop.  The  calculated  HEX  pressure  drop  was
used to iteratively update the cycle calculations until a threshold was
met in the pressure-drop predictions between consecutive iterations.
Different shell cross-sectional area sizes were also investigated. Huster
et  al.  [180]  developed  an  ANN  for  fluid–ORC  system  optimisation.
The  ANN  was  derived  from  a  full-scale  model  where  the  moving
boundary model (MBM) was used for the HEX, whose length was a
design variable.

While the above studies included geometric features of the HEX as
design variables, in several studies fixed HEX geometries were used. Le
et al. [272] considered a shell-and-tube HEX, including equations to
predict fouling. The discretisation of the HEXs in the case of two-phase

flows  indicated  that  50  segments  were  sufficient,  as  larger  numbers
up to 350 segments improved the predictions by less than 1 %. Yang
et al. [253] investigated a dual-loop ORC with few pure fluids. A fin-
and-tube type HEX was selected to recover heat from high-temperature
flue  gases,  whereas  plate  HEXs  were  proposed  for  the  intercooler,
condenser, preheater, and second evaporator.

Wang et al. [254] used plate HEXs for all the heat-transfer processes.
Rosset  et  al.  [255]  used  HEX  models  in  six  ORC  configurations  to
exploit engine waste heat, with all using an air-cooled condenser and
a regenerator. The configurations included single-source heat using the
engine coolant, single-source heat using exhaust gases, dual-source heat
with series evaporators, dual-source heat, dual-regeneration with series
evaporators, dual-source heat with parallel evaporators and dual-source
heat, dual-pressure with parallel evaporators.

Jankowski  and  co-workers  [256,257]  proposed  the  use  of  plate
HEXs,  considering  discretisation  of  1000 finite  elements  in  the  two-
phase regions. Bianchi et al. [258] used the moving-boundary model
(MBM)  for  the  HEX.  In  this  case,  the  HEX  had  only  three  zones,
whose limits were determined spatially by the phase-change features of
the fluid.

The  above  studies  refer  to  steady-state  simulations;  few  of  them
contain explicit mention of the use of an MBM. This model is mainly
used for dynamic modelling, but the division of the fluid flow in control
volumes that equal the number of states (e.g., subcooled, two-phase,
and superheated-vapour) corresponds to a moving-boundary approach
in  steady-state  [180].  The  difference  with  the  dynamic  implementa-
tion  of  this  model  is  that  the  size  of  the  control  volumes  varies  in
time during transient operation, following the saturated-liquid and the
saturated-vapour  boundaries  [288].  Another  model  that  is  used  for
dynamic HEX modelling is the finite-volume model (FVM). This consists
in discretising the HEX volume into a number of equal and constant
control volumes [288].

Grelet et al. [259] employed the FVM, where the HEX representa-
tion was based on discretisation into a number of longitudinal lumped
volumes of equal length. In each volume, there were three zones; one
representing the fluid state in the internal pipe, one representing the
state of the metal of the pipe wall, and a final one representing the fluid
state in the external pipe. Therefore, discretisation was implemented
both horizontally and vertically.

Shu et al. [260], Wang et al. [261] and Chen et al. [268] employed
the MBM in fluid-assessment studies. Cai et al. [269] compared the
MBM and the FVM based on results from an experimental rig for a mix-
ture at different concentrations. The authors noted that five ordinary
differential equations need to be solved at each volume in the FVM,
indicating that the need for multiple segments would increase the size
and complexity of the simulations compared to the MBM, which only
requires three segments. Both models matched the transient experimen-
tal results in the evaporator sufficiently, but the MBM simulation could
not continue in cases where the superheated state disappeared during
the experiment.

Zarogiannis and co-workers [265–267] further employed the FVM
for  the  boiler  and  condenser.  The  surface  areas  of  the  HEX  were
design variables, together with other cycle parameters, in a challenging
mixture-selection and optimum-ORC control problem. Pili et al. [262]
employed  the  MBM  for  the  boiler  and  considered  several  geomet-
ric parameters as design variables for the dynamic ORC performance
assessment of pure fluids (see Table A.4, in the Appendix).

3.4.3.  Key observations

Expander modelling is of paramount importance for the prediction
of  the  overall  ORC  efficiency  and  performance.  Working-fluid  ther-
modynamic  properties  influence  the  conditions  in  the  expander  for
a  given  set  of  geometric  configurations.  The  proper  adjustment  of
such configurations for optimal operation can be achieved through a
combination of empirical strategies and systematic optimisation pro-
cedures. Since expander performance can significantly deteriorate at

25

C.N. Markides et al.

off-design operating points, it is necessary that an optimisation pro-
cedure takes into consideration both the range of possible operating
conditions and the frequency that such conditions will occur during
the life span of the system. In this way, a robust expander performance
can  be  achieved  without  the  extra  costs  of  overdesign.  Truly,  3-D
computational  models  offer  good  accuracy  in  expander-performance
predictions, but the computational burden that is associated with such
models is large, and their use in optimisation studies is prohibitive.
However, 3-D expander models can provide a simulation test-bed for
the  generation  of  numerous  datasets  for  various  working  fluids  and
geometric configurations that will enable the development of surrogate
models for reliable performance predictions. The key challenges are the
determination of the degree of model resolution for 3-D simulations
to  obtain  accurate  performance  predictions,  preferably  validated  in
experimental test rigs, and the generation of sufficiently large data sets
for the development of high-fidelity surrogate models.

In the case of HEX modelling, the MBM has been mentioned in both
dynamic and steady-state simulations. The FVM has been used in dy-
namic simulations but has not been mentioned explicitly in steady-state
simulations, although the discretisation rationale was similar to that of
the dynamic implementation of the FVM. Xu et al. [289] noted that the
computational effort of the MBM is lower because the model equations
are solved only in three segments (e.g., preheating, evaporation, and
superheating in the boiler), whereas multiple segments are used in the
FVM model. The downside of the MBM is that numerical challenges
appear when one or more fluids in a mixture disappear from one of the
phases or when different phases (e.g., vapour or liquid) or states (e.g.,
superheated fluid) disappear. Such problems were also reported by Cai
et  al.  [269],  who  further  compared  predictions  from  the  MBM  and
the FVM with experimental data and observed insignificant differences
in both cases, despite the fact that the MBM is a lumped model. The
number of segments selected in the FVM affects the attained accuracy.
Xu et al. [289] reported errors that decrease from 10.5 % to 0.9 %, as
the number of segments increases from five to 30.

In ORCs, system simulations rely on phase-equilibrium calculations
that involve significant numerical challenges due to the appearance and
disappearance of phases and states, especially as the number of mixture
components and segments increases. In principle, the identification of
a stable phase requires the global minimisation of the state function
of interest, e.g., of the Gibbs free energy. Such functions are usually
nonconvex, and the identification of local minima results in states of
metastable equilibrium, whereas the use of global optimisation incurs
significant computational effort. To this end, advanced algorithms have
been  developed  to  address  such  issues,  such  as  the  Helmholtz  free
Energy  Lagrangian  Dual  (HELD)  algorithm  [290]  or  the  algorithm
of  Mitsos  and  Barton  [291]  that  is  also  based  on  Lagrange  duality.
These  algorithms  are  worth  considering  as  a  means  of  reducing  the
computational  effort  and  of  evaluating  phase  stability,  formation  of
azeotropes, the appearance of minimum or maximum flash points, etc.,
in ORC fluid selection and system design.

The two types of HEX that dominate the current literature are the
shell-and-tube HEX and the plate HEX. The latter are more compact
and  enable  better  heat  transfer  at  the  expense  of  higher  pressure
drops [252]. This results in the need for higher pressure on the working-
fluid side, higher backpressure on the heat-source side, and thus addi-
tional losses and costs if heat is to be extracted from flue gases; they
are also susceptible to problems when used at higher temperatures or
flows with particulates (e.g., internal-combustion engines). Di Battista
et al. [252] noted that shell-and-tube HEXs enable a reasonable trade-
off between heat-transfer efficiency and pressure drop, while their costs
are lower and their design is simpler. Different HEX types have also
been  proposed,  such  as  the  shell-and-louvered  fin  mini-tubes  [292],
the shell-and-tube HEX with plate baffles [293], the corrugated tube
HEX with twisted tape inserts [294] or the tube-in-tube HEX with metal
foam structures [295]. All these HEX types are worth investigating in
the context of different fluids and ORC configurations.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

The results attained by HEX models are affected by the use of differ-
ent heat transfer correlations. Zhang et al. [296] investigated the effects
of 8 two-phase heat transfer correlations, including 4 flow boiling and 4
flow condensation ones, in the operating, economic and environmental
ORC performance. At design conditions they found that for different
flow  condensation  correlations  the  relative  difference  between  the
maximum predicted condenser plate length and the minimum one is
up to 103%, whereas different flow boiling correlations do not affect
significantly the size of the evaporator. Under off-design conditions,
they found that the net power output exhibits a relative difference of
1.1% for 4 different flow boiling correlations.  Examining all combi-
nations of the flow boiling and combination condensation correlations
they reported that the relative difference of the electricity production
cost is up to 11.2%, whereas the environmental performance, measured
in total tons of CO2 equivalents, changes by less than 1%. Deviations
of similar ranges, due to the use of different heat transfer coefficients
in  the  evaporator,  were  also  reported  by  Calise  et  al.  [297].  They
additionally observed that for higher heat transfer areas the deviations
are lower. These findings indicate clearly that the choice of the heat
transfer coefficient incurs significant uncertainty and that systematic
methods are necessary to address it, as discussed in the next section.
If this uncertainty is not considered, then rankings of working fluids
may change significantly depending on the choice of the heat transfer
correlation or of other parameters with uncertainty, affecting especially
those fluids that exhibit close performance and behaviour.

3.5.  Uncertainty quantification approaches

In some studies on fluid selection sensitivity analysis has been em-
ployed to determine how certain cycle performance indicators change
when different fluids are considered or when some cycle operating pa-
rameters change [19,298]. This is important as the performance of the
fluids and the cycle may be affected by uncertainty in experimentally
attained  property  values,  in  the  underlying  property-  and  process-
prediction models, or by operating variability.  The quantification of
this  uncertainty  requires  the  use  of  approaches  that  can  account  si-
multaneously for the uncertain realisations of multiple parameters and
systematically assess their effects on different performance indicators.
One  such  approach  was  presented  by  Papadopoulos  et  al.  [141]
to assess the effects of property uncertainties in the thermal and ex-
ergetic ORC efficiency, considering a set of mixtures that was identi-
fied as Pareto-optimum in computer-aided molecular-mixture design.
The  method  included  non-linear  sensitivity  analysis  based  on  first-
derivative information, where multiple parameter variations were prop-
agated through the cycle model to determine their simultaneous effects
on multiple performance indicators. Essentially, the proposed method
quantified  the  sensitivity  of  the  cycle  performance  indicators  under
changes  in  the  multi-parametric  space  and  determined  the  property
parameters where the smallest variations incurred the highest perfor-
mance changes. The results indicated that the performance of certain
mixtures was sensitive to changes in property values such as the critical
temperature and pressure, and the boiling point. Mixtures were also
identified for which both the thermal and exergetic ORC predictions
were robust, as they were not affected significantly by changes in the
component property parameters. The approach was recently extended
[299] by incorporating second-derivative information in the analysis
and  testing  the  robustness  in  the  predictions  of  different  EoS  and
activity-coefficient  models  under  variability  in  property  parameters.
Sensitivity analysis based on second derivatives is vital in optimisation,
as models that give rise to process state and performance profiles that
are very non-linear may be avoided. The approach was implemented
in  a  vapour  absorption  refrigeration  cycle  and  can  be  easily  tested
in ORCs.

Frutiger and co-workers [300,301] developed an advanced, Monte
Carlo-based approach for uncertainty quantification and selection of

26

C.N. Markides et al.

ORC working fluids. 1965 pure working fluids were initially investi-
gated with respect to their performance in an ORC model. In the first
stage, two ORC operating parameters were sampled from a uniform dis-
tribution using the Latin-hypercube method. Each fluid was simulated
for each pair of sampled parameters, and the ones that satisfied specific
ORC operating constraints were selected. The process variables giving
the  highest  net  power  output  were  then  selected  for  each  selected
working fluid. In the second stage, 400 samples were drawn from a
normal distribution using a Latin hypercube for each one of the eight
fluid parameters. Each sample was then simulated through the ORC
at the optimal operating parameter values identified in the previous
stage.  The  fluids  were  then  rank-ordered  based  on  their  net  power
output,  with  their 95 % confidence  interval.  The  work  showed  that
the ranking of fluids differed significantly when property uncertainty
was considered.

The above uncertainty propagation approach was extended to in-
vestigate the sensitivity of the Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK) [302] and
PC-SAFT [303] EoS, when they are used in ORC simulations [304].
Uncertainties were quantified for the critical temperature and pressure,
and  for  the  acentric  factor  in  SRK,  for  the  segment  diameter,  the
chain length, and the energy parameters in PC-SAFT and the Aly-Lee,
ideal-gas heat-capacity coefficients [305]. The uncertain distributions
of these parameters were then propagated through the ORC model. It
was then observed that the departure functions of these EoS dominated
the total uncertainties in the ORC performance predictions and that SRK
incurred lower uncertainty in the simulation output.

Frutiger et al. [306] further evaluated the Monte Carlo sampling and
the Morris screening techniques to estimate the effects of different fluid
parameters in ORC power output. Uncertainties in critical temperature
and pressure, acentric factor, molecular weight, and the Aly-Lee, ideal-
gas heat-capacity coefficients were propagated through the ORC model
using the Peng–Robinson [307] EoS. It was observed that the Morris
screening technique was more reliable, as it did not require the assump-
tion of a linearisable model, as in the case of Monte Carlo. However,
Morris screening did not account for correlation and interdependencies
of the fluid parameters, which need to be filtered out. It was found that
the critical temperature and pressure and the acentric factor incurred
higher changes in the ORC net power output than the other investi-
gated parameters. Hence it is important to have accurate values for
these parameters.

Santos-Rodriguez et al. [308] addressed the mixture selection and
ORC design problem under uncertainty through a stochastic  optimi-
sation  framework.  Using  a  set  of  four  pre-specified  pure  fluids,  the
goal was to determine the optimum number and concentration of the
mixtures,  together  with  the  optimum  ORC  operating  characteristics.
The first stage addressed the perfect information problem, where the
effects  of  the  heat-source  temperature  on  the  mixture  composition
and concentration and on the cycle efficiency were determined. This
provided parameter sensitivity information and a target of ideal perfor-
mance. The stochastic optimisation problem was solved in the second
stage,  where  the  optimum  mixture  was  found  that  maximised  the
mean cycle efficiency over a desired heat-source temperature range.
The  approach  employed  risk  measures  in  the  form  of  the  variance
and the conditional value-at-risk in the formulation of the stochastic
optimisation problem to facilitate the optimisation search across the
uncertain  realisations.  The  results  indicated  that  different  mixtures
could be identified depending on the considered uncertain parameters.
Observations  that  are  similar  to  the  above  last  statement  were
made  in  several  of  the  reviewed  works.  Uncertainty  may  occur  in
the employed thermodynamic or process models (e.g., in parameters
such as fluid properties, transfer coefficients, etc.). The consideration of
uncertainty during fluid selection is important, but the need to evaluate
multiple uncertain realisations increases the computational effort. It is
therefore important to be able to identify the parameters that incur
the highest changes in the ORC performance indicators and avoid the
ones that exhibit low sensitivity to changes. The latter would increase

the computational effort without any significant effect on the attained
results. When uncertainty is represented through continuous distribu-
tions,  the  choice  of  the  distribution  sampling  method  is  important.
Uniform sampling is needed to ensure efficient representation of the
continuous distributions and to avoid oversampling some distribution
areas at the expense of others. There are various sampling methods,
such  as  Latin  hypercube  (LatHS),  Hammersley  sequence  (HSS),  and
Sobol sampling (SS) [309]. A recent study [309] on the use of such
methods in optimisation under uncertainty of various linear and non-
linear objective functions indicated that HSS performs best for up to 40
uncertain variables, SS for up to 100 variables, LatHS-SS for over 100
variables and LatHS-HSS for up to 250 variables.

The impact of using different heat transfer correlations has been
clearly  highlighted  in  the  previous  section,  however  the  underlying
uncertainties  have  not  been  accounted  for  in  ORC  optimisation  sys-
tematically. The different approaches outlined above may enable the
identification of both the heat transfer correlations and even specific
terms  included  in  each  one  of  them,  that  incur  the  highest  impacts
in  multiple  ORC  performance  indicator  simultaneously.  This  could
greatly  help  identify  which  correlations  or  which  correlation  terms
need  to  be  improved  through  further  experiments,  as  well  as  the
areas of the parameter space in which such experiments need to take
place. Furthermore, through some of the reported methods, the existing
correlations may be used simultaneously during ORC optimisation to
identify optimum system conditions and working fluids in view of the
uncertainty in such correlations.

3.6.  Fluid selection and ORC off-design assessment

The key features of approaches pertaining to the use of advanced
techniques for off-design ORC performance assessment considering dif-
ferent  fluids  are  summarised  in Table  A.5,  in Appendix.  Deviation
from the design point in an ORC system can result from the effects of
disturbances affecting the system (e.g., drifting in the hot- and cold-
source stream temperatures and flow rates, fouling in the evaporator
and  condenser,  and  so  forth),  and  output  power  level  changes.  The
direct  result  is  a  quick  deterioration  of  the  overall  efficiency  of  the
system. A control system aims to maintain the efficiency at the high-
est  possible  level  for  the  operating  set  of  conditions.  Working-fluid
properties are influenced by the changes in the operating conditions.
Depending on the sensitivity of the fluid properties to such changes, the
speed of response of the control system is affected despite the employed
control algorithm and its tuning [310]. Lu et al. [311] exploited this
fact and proposed a concentration adjustment to the working fluid, a
mixture of R245fa and R113, whenever the ORC system was in off-
design operating regime. In this way, the temperature glide could be
manipulated by altering the proportion of the most volatile to the least
volatile  components  in  the  mixture  so  that  the  overall  efficiency  is
maintained within the acceptable range.

Mavrou et al. [312,313] selected four novel and one conventional
fluid  mixture  that  exhibited  high  steady-state  performance  from  the
prior work of Mavrou et al. [314,315], to investigate their operabil-
ity  performance  under  the  influence  of  disturbances.  A  systematic
approach  was  used,  where  numerous  disturbances  were  propagated
simultaneously  through  a  non-linear,  equilibrium  solar  ORC  model
to investigate their impacts on multiple performance indicators. The
overall design goal was to minimise a sensitivity index, expressed in the
form of a control performance index that minimised the distance of the
controlled variables (e.g. work output) from the desired operating set-
point and the use of resources to bring the system back to its set-point.
The  authors  did  not  consider  dynamic  models  but  highlighted  in  a
systematic way, by considering a series of steady-state simulations, the
importance of considering variability as part of working-fluid selection.
Chatzopoulou et al. [316] employed an approach that combined an
optimisation algorithm with part-load operation. Initially, the authors
addressed  the  optimum  sizing  of  the  components  of  an  ORC  under

27

C.N. Markides et al.

steady-state operation. Subsequently, they optimised the operating con-
ditions of the cycle, for the identified optimum cycle size, for a series of
heat-source conditions. An interesting feature was how the simulation
of the expanders was handled. The operating points generated by the
optimiser at each iteration were introduced in expander maps to calcu-
late updated isentropic efficiencies and mass flow rates. The iterations
continued until the expander outputs matched those of the energy and
mass balances.

Pang et al. [317] investigated the long-term operation of a 3 kW
ORC under different control strategies for the pump head and, subse-
quently, the mass flow rate of the working fluid. They further developed
a simulation model that could act as a platform for the determination
of the optimal operational policies under off-design conditions. R245fa,
R123, and their mixtures were systematically evaluated with a mixture
achieving the highest system efficiency of 5.14 %.

Pili et al. [262] designed an ORC system for waste-heat recovery
with  an  application  for  heavy-duty  trucks  that  considered  working-
fluid interactions for a wide range of operating conditions. A dynamic
model for the ORC with an incorporated control system consisted of
one proportional-integral (PI) controller for the mass flow rate in the
pump and one proportional controller for the exhaust by-pass valve
in  the  evaporator.  The  time-averaged  power  generation  of  the  ORC
system was the criterion that was related to the off-design operation
and  closely  linked  to  the  controller  performance.  Toluene,  followed
by ethanol, exhibited the highest power generated, but the cost of the
required installation of a vacuum system should be taken into account.
Zarogiannis [267] and Zarogiannis et al. [265,266] investigated the
impact of different working fluids on the control system performance
in an ORC system. A model predictive control (MPC) approach was
developed to maintain the power output at the desired level. Dynamic
models were utilised for the heat exchangers and pseudo-steady-state
models  for  the  pump  and  the  expander  in  the  ORC  system.  Novel
and  conventional  hydrocarbon-  and  halogenated  hydrocarbon-based
mixtures were considered within an integrated framework featuring an
ORC system model and a model predictive controller. Variation in the
hot source streams was considered in the system where the employed
MPC aimed to maintain the evaporator temperature at the desired level
and  achieve  the  maximum  work  in  the  expander.  The  simultaneous
problem  of  working-mixture  selection  and  ORC  design  under  open
and closed loop conditions was solved using the SA algorithm. It was
proposed  to  deal  with  the  design  decisions  through  comprehensive
criteria, which ensure the full inclusion of the underlying interactions
simultaneously instead of the sequential design of individual parts of
the cycle. The results provided significant insights into the behaviour
of the ORC system under closed-loop conditions in view of different
working  media.  For  example,  it  was  observed  that  the  effort  of  the
controller to compensate for the imposed disturbances is higher when
the employed working fluid is sensitive to disturbances. A working fluid
that is more resilient (less sensitive to disturbances) would be able to
absorb disturbances of wider ranges without requiring significant effort
from the underlying controller.

The integration of ORC design with the dynamic performance under
closed-loop conditions for various working fluids and a wide range of
operational conditions and disturbance scenarios is still at the initial
stage of development. Even though expander and heat-exchanger mod-
els can capture the impact of off-design operation, the control system
can alleviate such impact with the proper adjustment of the ORC system
operation mode. Clearly, the effort of the control system to manipulate
system operation depends on the ability of the equipment to accommo-
date the required corrective actions and the potential of the working
fluid  to  absorb  the  effects  of  undesired  deviations  and  favour  high
efficiency. The in-depth analysis of design decisions, as represented by
equipment capacity, cycle configuration, and working-fluid selection,
in accordance with the achievable dynamic performance has not yet
been fully explored. For instance, the impact of the degree of over-
design in equipment size on the ability of the system to quickly and

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

effectively compensate for disturbances needs to be carefully estimated
in terms of cost for the design and economic benefit from minimising
the time of operation away from the economic optimum. Optimisation-
based  controllers  clearly  provide  insights  into  cycle  operation  in  a
direct link to the economics of the ORC system and could offer the
solution to the outlined challenges.

4.  Working-fluid property prediction

As discussed in the Introduction, the working fluid is an integral ele-
ment of an ORC system, with a controlling role in determining its tech-
nical and thermodynamic performance. A key factor in ORC design is
therefore the ability to provide accurate and reliable predictions of the
thermophysical properties of the working fluid in conditions relevant
to ORC operation, such as the changes in specific enthalpy and entropy
undergone by the working fluid through each process in the overall
cycle, as well its viscosity and thermal conductivity at each stage.

4.1.  Empirical, highly accurate physical property models and their limita-
tions

Highly  accurate,  empirical  EoS  have  been  developed  for  well-
measured pure substances [318,319] and a small set of mixtures [320].
These  models  usually  provide  the  most  accurate  representation  of  a
species’  physical  properties  if  such  a  model  exists  for  the  substance
of  interest.  Models  of  this  class  rely  on  the  availability  of  sufficient
experimental data and are not predictive in nature. Among the array
of well-measured substances, it is possible to screen for ORC working
fluids, whereas a wider design space of substances cannot be analysed.
Further, highly accurate EoS can be used to unambiguously (concerning
the  static  properties)  determine  the  thermodynamic  behaviour  of  a
considered  pure  substance.  In  that  sense,  such  models  serve  as  a
reference to assess other predictive models.

4.2.  Models based on empirical group-contribution (GC) approaches

The  philosophy  of  GC  approaches  is  a  simple  one:  properties  of
a substance are obtainable as a sum of contributions from appropri-
ately designated chemical (functional) groups that together constitute
the molecules of which the substance is comprised. GC methods are
more  successful  for  some  physical  properties  and  less  so  for  others,
which is caused by missing information of how functional groups are
connected  to  one  another.  Both  intra-molecular  energies  and  inter-
molecular energies (or the appropriate partition sums) suffer from the
lack of detail on connectivity and proximity. For example, the effect of
intra-molecular hydrogen bonding on the considered physical property
cannot be properly predicted with a GC method. Making a distinction
between a possibly incomplete description of intra-molecular energies
and of inter-molecular energies rationalises why GC methods are rather
successful for ideal-gas properties that only suffer from shortcomings in
the representation of intra-molecular contributions but not by lack of
effective inter-molecular detail.

An excellent summary of empirical GC methods is provided in the
book of Poling et al. [321]; we note that an updated edition [322] of
this classic text has recently been published. Another more-recent per-
spective on GC methods, in general, has been provided by Gani [323].
Lydersen [324] developed a successful GC method to estimate criti-
cal  properties  in  the  1950s;  his  approach  was  later  extended  in  the
1980s  by  Joback  and  Reid  [64,325]  to  estimate  a  variety  of  pure-
component thermodynamic properties, including (of particular impor-
tance in the context of ORC modelling) the critical pressure and tem-
perature, the normal boiling temperature, the enthalpy of vaporisation
(at  the  normal  boiling  point),  and  the  temperature-dependent  ideal-
p (T ).  In  spite  of  their  age,  the  Joback  and  Reid
gas  heat  capacity, c0
correlations remain especially popular; for example, they are incorpo-
rated in process-modelling software such as ASPEN PLUS [326] and

28

C.N. Markides et al.

gPROMS [327]. They were adopted, together with the Riedel corre-
lation  [328]  for  saturation  (or  vapour)  pressure,  in  the  ORC  CAMD
work  of  Palma-Flores  et  al.  [329];  these  authors  proposed  a  simul-
taneous product and process design method for waste-heat recovery
using novel organic fluids, using ‘‘Rankine-like’’ cycles. They were also
adopted by Lukawski et al. [330] in their development of molecular-
property methods for assessing ORC efficiency. The early correlative
approaches of this type (often referred to as first-order GC methods)
were refined by Marrero-Morejón, Gani and co-workers [143,331,332]
to incorporate isomerism and proximity effects through the introduc-
tion of secondary groups. For example, Lukawski et al. [330] found the
second-order GC critical-temperature correlation of Marrero-Morejón
and Pardillo-Fontdevila [332] to be more reliable than the first-order
Joback  and  Reid  correlation  for  cases  where  experimental  values  of
normal boiling temperature were not available; more recently, Fanxiao
et al. [333] found that the Marrero–Pardillo method provided for more-
accurate exergy efficiency predictions of ORC systems (also reporting
that PC-SAFT [144,303] (discussed below) performed better than ei-
ther). Among the second-order approaches, the method of Constantinou
and Gani [331] has become popular; this allows for the calculation of
normal boiling point and melting point, critical pressure and temper-
ature, and standard enthalpy of vaporisation at 298 K (among other
pure-component thermodynamic properties). The approach has been
used, for example, in the studies of Papadopoulos and co-workers [98,
100,141,314,315,334–337]. In 2017, an extensive review of GC meth-
ods in the context of pure working fluids for thermodynamic cycles
was undertaken by Su et al. [338]. These authors considered in turn
thermodynamic (boiling temperature, critical properties, freezing tem-
perature, enthalpy of vaporisation, isobaric heat capacity, density, and
vapour  pressure)  and  transport  (viscosity  and  thermal  conductivity)
properties  of  interest,  providing  a  near-comprehensive  listing  of  GC
methods available for each at the time of publication although, per-
haps reflecting their relative infancy at the time, GC SAFT approaches
were largely overlooked. These authors also discussed environmental,
physicochemical and economic properties.

A  weakness  of  empirical  GC  approaches  is  that  their  quality  is
constrained by the amount and quality of experimental data available
for parameter refinement at the time of their development; any sort of
extrapolation of their use, either in the context of their application to
fluids not represented among the original data sets, or for predicting
properties at thermodynamic conditions not considered during group
development,  is  ill-advised;  this  could  lead  to  inconsistencies  in  the
treatment of different candidate working-fluid molecules, whereby care
is required to ensure the selection of the most-appropriate correlations.
Poling et al. provide useful comparisons for this purpose in relation
to GC methods available at the turn of the millennium. In this con-
text,  we  note  that  the  contributions  for  the  Joback  and  Reid c0
p (T )
correlation were developed for temperatures from ambient to 1000 K,
which should suffice for most ORC applications, but this range should
be  kept  in  mind  should  the  low  temperature  of  the  cycle  be  below
ambient. Recently, a statistical-mechanics-based alternative [339] has
been proposed that retains better performance outside this temperature
range,  as  well  as  providing  a  significant  improvement  in  the  case
of halogenated compounds, for which the Joback and Reid approach
suffers reduced accuracy [321,339].

GC  approaches  have  also  been  developed  for  mixtures,  initially
focusing  on  activity  coefficients  in  liquid  mixtures.  Indeed,  perhaps
the most important GC method historically is the well-known univer-
sal  functional  activity  coefficient  (UNIFAC)  approach  [65,340,341],
that, together with its modifications, has been firmly established for
many years.

4.3.  Activity-coefficient models and cubic equations of state

Activity-coefficient models — in particular, local-composition activity-

coefficient models, exemplified by the Wilson [342], non-random two-
liquid  (NRTL)  [343],  the  universal  quasichemical  (UNIQUAC)  [344,

29

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

345] models, and the GC variants, the analytical solution of groups
(ASOG) model [346] and UNIFAC [65,340,341] – represent a route to
thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures that can be successfully
applied  in  the  case  of  working  fluids.  A  useful  discussion  of  the
approach and its strengths and weaknesses (particularly in comparison
to the use of EoS) has been provided in Chapters 5 and 6 of the book
of Kontogeorgis and Folas [347]. The NRTL model has been employed
for  working-fluid  modelling  in  the  context  of  ORCs  or  related  cycle
devices [348–352] while UNIFAC has been used by Thierry et al. [278]
in their work on simultaneous optimal design of multi-stage ORCs and
working-fluid mixtures. However, in general, the approach has not been
widely adopted in connection to ORCs and related systems.

In the context of CAMD, UNIFAC represents the most relevant of this
class of model due to its GC nature allied to the substantial database of
available parameters. Indeed, the feasibility of adopting GC approaches
such as this rests on the availability of numerous adjustable parameters,
which are obtained by adjustment (‘‘fitting’’) using experimental data.
Although, by now, the database of parameters available for UNIFAC
is  extensive,  parameters  for  a  particular  group  may  nevertheless  be
unavailable, in which case the approach cannot be used — this is a
problem that has its analogue in most GC approaches, including GC EoS
(see below). We note, however, that recently, the challenge of missing
UNIFAC parameters has been approached through the application of
matrix-completion methods to predict the missing parameters [353].

The quantum-mechanical conductor-like screening (COSMO) meth-
ods, further developed by Klamt for describing real solvents (COSMO-
RS)  [354–356]  offer  a  predictive  alternative  to  activity  coefficient
models  for  the  calculation  of  liquid  thermodynamic  properties.  De-
spite their foundation in quantum mechanics, these methods possess
adjustable  parameters  for  size,  short-ranged  hydrogen-bonding  ener-
gies,  and  element-specific  van  der  Waals  energies.  COSMO-RS  has
been adopted in working-fluid screening for ORCs [148,216,357] and
CAMD for chemical-engineering problems [358]. The more-transparent
COSMO  segment  activity-coefficient  model  (COSMO-SAC)  [359]  has
been adopted in ORC modelling [360] but, so far as we are aware, not
yet in a CAMD context. Recently, an open-source implementation [361]
of three versions [359,362,363] of COSMO-SAC has been made avail-
able by Bell and co-workers, together with an excellent exposition of
the approach [364], which will make it a convenient option for use in
future research.

In a recent ground-breaking enterprise, Winter and co-workers [365,
366] have introduced further predictive power to activity-coefficient
methods for binary mixtures through the so-called SMILES-to-Property
Transformer (SPT)–NRTL [366] approach, a transformer-based machine-
learning model to predict concentration-dependent thermodynamically
consistent binary activity coefficients and their corresponding NRTL pa-
rameters, based solely on simplified molecular-input line-entry system
(SMILES) codes. (SMILES [367–369] refers to a systematic procedure
for translating the molecular structure of a compound into a string of
symbols that is easily interpretable in a computer code.) These authors
introduced a pre-training step on synthetic property data sampled from
COSMO-RS and a second, fine-tuning step, training on experimental
data. They have provided NRTL parameters for 100 000 000 mixtures
with  more  than  10 000  unique  molecules,  and  have  demonstrated
superior performance from SPT–NRTL compared with COSMO-RS and
UNIFAC in most examples considered. There is clear potential for this
approach in the design of binary-mixture working fluids for ORCs.

A drawback with the activity-coefficient or COSMO-based approa-
ches is that one is obliged to adopt, in tandem, a different approach
to obtain vapour-phase properties; care must therefore be exercised to
ensure thermodynamic consistency. Typically, a cubic EoS is employed.
For  example,  Thierry  et  al.  adopted  the  SRK  EoS  [302]  (for  pure
components) and the predictive-SRK (PSRK) [370] (for mixtures) to-
gether with UNIFAC; in the investigations of Preißinger and co-workers
[148,216,357] the COSMO-RS theory was combined with a generalised
Patel–Teja equation [371], while Xu et al. chose the Peng–Robinson

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

EoS [307] in their study with COSMO-SAC. We note that this type of
combined approach is becoming more accessible to researchers outside
the field of fluid-thermodynamic modelling with the emergence in re-
cent times of open-source software, such as FeOs [372], that of Bell and
co-workers [361,364,373], Phasepy [374], and Clapeyron.jl [375,376],
wherein the Wilson, NRTL, UNIFAC and COSMO-SAC approaches, as
well  as  a  wide  variety  of  EoS  (both  cubic  and  SAFT)  have  all  been
implemented and can be straightforwardly combined.

GC  activity-coefficient  methods  such  as  UNIFAC,  as  well  as  the
COSMO approaches, are well suited to a CAMD framework, however
this may not be true of the equation (or equations) of state with which
they are paired. For the approach to be completely versatile these EoS
should also be amenable to application within a GC strategy.

Within the framework of EoS modelling of fluids, GC approaches
evolved  initially  in  relation  to  mixture  calculations  using  cubic  EoS
through so-called EoS/GE mixing rules. The link to GC approaches was
through the incorporation, within the mixing rules, of activity coeffi-
cients that could, for example, be obtained from a GC approach, such as
UNIFAC. The first of the EoS/GE mixing rules was developed by Huron
and Vidal [377]. Improved EoS/GE mixing rules were later introduced
by various researchers, including Michelsen and co-workers [378–380],
and Wong and Sandler [381]; the PSRK EoS [370] is an example that
falls into this category. Later, adopting a slightly different philosophy,
a GC approach was introduced that enables the prediction of the binary
interaction  (or  ‘‘kij ’’)  parameter  used  in  mixture  combining  rules  to
characterise  the  unlike  (cross)  attractive  EoS  parameter  [382,383].
Each of these two strategies confers predictive power on cubic EoS that
had hitherto been largely correlative, thereby allowing for their use in
the design of working-fluid mixtures.

More recently, GC approaches have been applied to pure-component
modelling with cubic EoS in the context of ORC modelling. The use of
standard cubic EoS such as SRK [302] or Peng–Robinson [307] requires
prior knowledge of the critical temperature, Tc, and pressure, pc, (to
evaluate the EoS parameters a and b), and the acentric factor, ω (for
the evaluation of the α function)). GC methods are available for each
of these and, by extension, can be used collectively for cubic EoS. For
example, Chen et al. [384] recently applied the Peng–Robinson and
the volume-translated Peng–Robinson (VTPR) [385] EoS in a CAMD
study pertaining to ORC working fluids. Following Peng et al. [386]
these  authors  used  the  GC  methods  of  Su  et  al.  [387]  for Tc, pc, ω
p , together with the GC method of Nannoola et al. [388] for the
and c0
critical volume, Vc, which is required in addition for the VTPR EoS. The
approach was tested on four commonly used working fluids, R245fa,
R600a, R601a and R1234ze(E); in terms of the predicted thermody-
namic properties it was observed that, although the deviations (from
REFPROP [389] data) were higher than those obtained when using the
Peng–Robinson and VTPR EoS parameterised in the conventional way,
they were nevertheless within acceptable limits.

4.4.  Statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT)

In essence, when adopting a traditional cubic EoS, one is assuming
that  the  fluid  molecule  can  be  adequately  represented  as  a  sphere
(in  particular,  of  a  hard  spherical  core  surrounded  by  a  region  of
attraction);  there  is  recognition  neither  of  asymmetry  in  molecular
shape nor of polarity in the underlying molecular model. A consequence
of the former is that cubic EoS are not well suited for modelling large,
highly non-spherical molecules; this may not be a concern since such
molecules  are  unlikely  to  be  encountered  in  the  context  of  working
fluids  for  ORCs.  The  neglect  of  polarity,  however,  is  of  more  sig-
nificance;  in  particular,  no  account  is  taken  of  the  possible  impact
of  intermolecular  association  (often  important  in  the  case  of  polar
molecules, which are commonly encountered in working-fluid design).
Thus, when adopting cubic EoS within CAMD, the relative success of
the strategy is dependent on the nature of molecules designed; in this
sense, cubic EoS are not naturally well suited for CAMD. By contrast, a

conventional SAFT EoS is more versatile; the adoption of a molecular
model comprising instead a chain of spherical segments allows better
recognition of molecular shape. The segments, which interact with each
other via a pair potential (such as Lennard-Jones, or Mie), can also be
furnished with ‘‘sticky sites’’ (sometimes described as ‘‘intermolecular
velcro’’), thereby accounting for association interactions, such as hydro-
gen bonding. Moreover, the EoS parameters each have a clear physical
meaning in relation to this molecular model; this is a key feature in
CAMD, facilitating searches in molecular parameter space.

The  Helmholtz  free  energy  of  the  fluid  is  expressed  as  a  sum  of
contributions,  each  arising  from  different  features  of  the  underlying
molecular model, making the SAFT approach highly adaptable, as is
reflected in the number of versions that have become available since the
first SAFT equation [66,67] was introduced by Gubbins and co-workers,
including  soft-SAFT  [390],  SAFT-VR  [391,392],  PC-SAFT  [144,303]
and  SAFT-VR  Mie  [145].  (We  note  that  implementations  of  all  the
major SAFT versions are available open-source, together with coded
algorithms for their use [372,375,376]). The inclusion of extra contri-
butions in the free-energy expression has allowed the development of
SAFT EoS for fluids of polar molecules [393–405], and of electrolyte
solutions [406–418]. The extra versatility of SAFT, compared to cubic
EoSs, comes at the price of greater computational expense. The majority
of the increased computational cost comes from the evaluation of the
association contribution, which includes numerical calculations (of the
bonding volume and degree of association). In addition to the extra
computational cost, a greater burden is placed on the numerical solvers
when solving, for example, for fluid-phase equilibrium, so that robust
solvers are required.

The first contribution to the free energy in any SAFT equation is the
ideal free energy, AIDEAL. However, strictly speaking, the evaluation of
this contribution is not made using the SAFT theory, which provides
only the residual (or non-ideal) part of the free energy; this subtlety is
often overlooked or misunderstood. In practice, the ideal contribution
is usually ‘‘backed out’’ from the ideal-gas heat capacity, whereby the
user is required to choose the source of c0
p appropriate to the problem
at hand — just as one would when using, for example, a cubic EoS;
typically the Joback and Reid [64] correlation is adopted. (In some
commercial software in which SAFT is implemented, the ideal contribu-
tion is hardwired; this may have contributed to the confusion over its
role in the theory.) The relative importance of the ideal contribution
to the whole free energy can be high, even in the liquid phase. This
can be assessed by comparing the ideal-gas and total heat capacities;
for example, at ambient conditions the ratio c0
p ∕cp for water is ∼ 45%.
The significance of the ideal contribution has been discussed in some
depth by Walker and Haslam [339], and is illustrated in Fig. 14, using
n-butane as an example fluid. The calculated (p, T ) fluid phase diagram
of n-butane  is  presented  as  a  colour  map  depicting  the  ratio c0
p ∕cp;
calculations were performed using (in this case) SAFT-γ Mie [79] (the
GC analogue of SAFT-VR Mie [145]), incorporating the c0
p model of
Walker  and  Haslam  [339].  One  can  see  that  the  ideal  contribution
is  dominant  throughout  much  of  the  phase  diagram,  exceeding  the
residual contribution even throughout much of the liquid region. This
emphasises the need for, at the least, an awareness of the characteristics
and range of applicability of the adopted correlation for c0
p .

In  the  context  of  the  current  article,  an  important  consequence
of the adaptability of the SAFT approach is that SAFT equations are
more suitable for CAMD modelling than, for example, their classical
cubic  counterparts.  Bardow  and  co-workers  [20,51,55,276,277,419–
428]  have  exploited  this  in  their  pioneering  CAMD  work  on  ORC
systems using PC-SAFT [144,303] (probably the most popular among
the widely-used versions of SAFT), adapting the approach taken in re-
lated earlier work [57] on integrated solvent and process design. These
authors showed that, by treating the PC-SAFT molecular parameters as
continuous, they can be optimised together with other process param-
eters, searching for the optimal hypothetical working fluid (and corre-
sponding ORC cycle). These parameters are mapped onto a database

of parameters representing real fluids using an approximation of the
process-based objective function to identify the best candidate working
fluid. In subsequent work, the MINLP is solved using a GC approach
both for the EoS and for transport coefficients [274,277,424,427,428].
Among  other  versions  of  SAFT,  SAFT-VR  Mie  [145]  has  also  found
considerable use in the context of modelling ORC systems [18,89,193,
316,429–439]. Through the use of the highly adaptable Mie potential
to  represent  the  interaction  between  monomer  segments,  allied  to
greater sophistication in the statistical–mechanical foundation of the
theory, this particular version of SAFT [145] was developed to provide
improved  descriptions  of  second-derivative  properties,  such  as  heat
capacity and Joule–Thomson coefficient – properties that are highly
relevant in the context of working fluids for ORCs and related devices
–  while  retaining  the  all-round  excellent  description  of  traditionally
targeted properties, such as fluid phase equilibrium and densities.

4.5.  Group-contribution SAFT approaches

Conventional  SAFT  EoS  such  as  SAFT-VR  Mie  and  PC-SAFT  –
notwithstanding  their  innovative  use  in  CAMD  –  are  not,  of  them-
selves, GC equations. However, GC adaptions of these and other SAFT
variants  have  been  published;  for  a  recent  review  see  Shaahmadi
et al. [440]. In some of these publications (Refs. [68,69,72,441–443]
for PC-SAFT; Ref. [71] for original SAFT [67] and SAFT-VR [391]), GC
approaches are introduced to characterise the (identical) segments of
the homonuclear chain comprising the model molecule, after the fashion
of  a  GC-based  mixing  rule  for  the  molecular  parameters  [444];  the
fluid properties are then evaluated using the existing SAFT theory. By
contrast to these homonuclear approaches, in the GC-SAFT-VR [78], hs-
PC-SAFT [444] and SAFT-γ [76,77,79] approaches, the GC concept is
embedded within the SAFT formalism itself. A more-detailed molecular
model is incorporated, wherein different types of monomeric segments
are used to represent the individual chemical functional groups making
up  a  molecule;  the  model  molecule  is,  therefore, heteronuclear.  A
systematic comparison of a homonuclear GC PC-SAFT approach and a
heteronuclear GC model showed that the heteronuclear leads to better
correlation  results  [445].  Moreover,  the  retention  of  the  functional-
group  information  in  the  molecular  model  allows  for  the  prediction
of  thermodynamic  properties  of  mixtures  based  on  pure-component

31

data alone [77–79,446], which can be an advantage. Markides and co-
workers have pioneered the use of this class of GC-SAFT EoS in the
context of ORCs or related systems, [146,275,447–451] adopting SAFT-
γ Mie. As the GC analogue of SAFT-VR Mie, SAFT-γ Mie is particularly
well suited for use in this setting. Recently, Rehner et al. [452] have
been  the  first  to  use  a  heterosegmented  GC  PC-SAFT  implementa-
tion [444] as the property-prediction model in a CAMPD application,
highlighting the design of an ORC system as a case study. In another
recent study, Rehner et al. [453] proposed a GC method for binary-
interaction parameters for the homo- and heteronuclear GC methods for
PC-SAFT. This advancement holds promise for enhancing the accuracy
of mixture modelling in ORC CAMPD applications relying on PC-SAFT.

4.6.  Equations of state informed by machine learning

Although a relatively new field, machine-learning (ML) techniques
are  already  impacting  thermodynamic-property  prediction  and  have
been applied to equations of state to improve their predictive power.
For example, Chaparro and Müller [454] have developed an ML EoS
by training a neural network on molecular-dynamics simulation data.
In  recent  years,  notable  advancements  have  been  made  in  leverag-
ing  ML  techniques  to  predict  EoS  parameters.  For  example,  Biswas
et al. [455] presented a graph neural network that outputs the critical
point and the acentric factor of a fluid, thereby providing a method to
parameterise many types of cubic EoS. In pioneering endeavours, deep
neural networks have been integrated to predict pure-component pa-
rameters of PC-SAFT, utilising either group counts [456] or extended-
connectivity fingerprints [457] as inputs. In a comprehensive study,
Felton et al. [458] evaluated various model architectures, with random
forests emerging as the most accurate in predicting vapour pressures
and  liquid  densities.  However,  these  models  encounter  two  primary
limitations: firstly, the models are trained solely on pure-component
parameters,  failing  to  capture  the  sensitivity  of  the  PC-SAFT  model
itself; secondly, the training of the models relies on existing databases
of pure-component parameters, limiting applicability to molecules with
adequate experimental data for parameter regression. To address these
challenges, Winter et al. [459] recently embedded the PC-SAFT EoS
directly  into  the  training  process  of  a  transformer  model.  By  doing
so, the authors could train their SPT model directly on experimental
vapour-pressure  and  liquid-density  data,  thereby  capturing  the  PC-
SAFT sensitivity on model parameters. The resulting SPTPC−SAFT model
demonstrates remarkable performance, enabling the prediction of pure-
component parameters from SMILES codes with an average percentage
deviation of 13.5 % for vapour pressures and 3 % for liquid densities.
Given  the  necessity  of  SMILES  codes  for  model  input,  integrating
the SPTPC−SAFT model into CAMPD for ORC systems would require a
derivative-free optimisation algorithm (for details, see Section 5.2).

4.7.  Prediction of transport coefficients

Transport coefficients, such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, or
diffusion coefficients, play a significant role in determining ORC equip-
ment  dimensions,  and  thus  the  cost  of  the  ORC  system.  Any  mean-
ingful objective function thus relies on sufficiently accurate estimates
of transport coefficients [274]. GC models were developed for shear
viscosity [64] and for thermal conductivity [460], although limited to
liquid phases or to vapour phases [461]. Transport coefficients, like
the viscosity η(T , p) are functions of state variables temperature and
pressure, or temperature and density. Models for transport coefficients
are  thus  often  based  on  input  from  thermal  EoS,  such  as  friction
theory [462] or free-volume theory [463]. For constructing predictive
models, the most successful approach is excess entropy scaling proposed
by Rosenfeld [464,465]. The approach is suitable for viscosity, thermal
conductivity, and self-diffusion coefficients and is very simple to imple-
ment. In view of this it is perhaps surprising that it was neglected for
a number of years before being taken up by Novak [466–470] and by

C.N. Markides et al.

Gross and co-workers [471–476]; subsequently the approach has been
championed by Bell and co-workers [477–484].

4.8.  Other properties

Excess entropy scaling is based on the observation that transport
coefficients, made dimensionless with a suitable reference value, are,
to an excellent approximation, univariate functions only of residual (or
excess) entropy sr es, with sr es(T , ρ, x)  = s(T , ρ, x) − sig(T , ρ, x), where
sig is the entropy of an ideal gas. In Fig. 15, the principle of excess
entropy scaling is illustrated for three substances (methane, CO2, and
n-decane). The left diagram gives experimental viscosity data η made
dimensionless using a Chapman–Enskog equation, η∗ = η∕ηCE, covering
a wide range of temperature and pressure. Simple Ansatz functions,
such as low-order polynomials, can be used to correlate the logarithm
of the scaled transport properties with residual entropy. The red curve
of the left diagram (corresponding to n-decane) leads to the predictions
(red curves) on the right diagram by back converting η = η∗ ⋅ ηCE.

Models  for  the  shear  viscosity  [467,469]  and  self-diffusion  coef-
ficients  [466]  were  proposed  by  Novak  using  the  PC-SAFT  EoS  for
the residual entropy sr es. Lötgering-Lin and Gross [471] developed a
predictive GC method based on entropy scaling and PC-SAFT. For 100
pure species, the mean absolute relative deviation is about 5% for the
entire fluid phase (i.e., for vapour and liquid states); for three chemical
families,  the  deviations  are  higher,  reaching  about  10%.  Water  is
represented with deviations of 3.1%. In a subsequent study on mixtures,
Lötgering-Lin  et  al.  [472]  determined  a  mixing  rule  from  results  of
molecular simulations and applied the mixture model in a completely
predictive  manner  to  viscosities  of  real  mixtures.  For  566  mixtures
(34,500  experimental  data  points),  they  obtained  relative  mean  de-
viations  of,  on  average,  6%  for  mixtures  without  hydrogen-bonding
species. Deviations exceeded 10% for mixtures with hydrogen-bonding,
indicating  that  such  mixtures  require  an  adjusted  binary-interaction
parameter (‘‘kij ’’) for improved results.

Thermal conductivity was studied by Hopp and Gross by param-
eterising pure substances individually [473] but also by a predictive
GC method [475]. Both studies showed good agreement with experi-
mental data for thermal conductivity, even for substances with strong
hydrogen-bonds such as water and alcohols. Hopp et al. [474] proposed
a model for the self-diffusion coefficients of pure substances. In prac-
tical applications, of course, one is interested in binary diffusion coef-
ficients, say Maxwell–Stefan diffusion coefficients. Several approaches
exist  for  estimating  binary  diffusion  coefficients  from  self-diffusion
coefficients [321,476,486].

In summary, entropy scaling has shown to be powerful in devis-
ing predictive models for transport coefficients. The ability to predict
transport coefficients allows for a rough sizing and cost estimation of
key process equipment, which in turn is a requirement for economic
objective  functions  for  process  and  working-fluid  optimisation  [274,
277,428].

Other  important  working-fluid  properties  include  environmental
properties  (ODP,  GWP,  flammability,  and  toxicity)  physicochemical
properties (molecular weight, stability against thermal decomposition,
and chemical compatibility (with engine materials and, for example,
with lubricating oil)); although not strictly fluid properties, both avail-
ability and cost may also be considered relevant in this context. The
simplest approach is to exclude such properties from the CAMD itself,
taking account of them instead in a post-processing step. For example,
in a CAMD study for the selection of working fluids for refrigeration
cycles, Essa and Mohamed [487] considered only fundamental thermo-
dynamic criteria in the CAMD itself, considering the other properties in
a subsequent step after generating a list of candidate molecules. How-
ever, GC methods are nevertheless available for all of these quantities,
as discussed by Su et al. [338] in relation to pure (single-component)
working fluids.

The flammability of mixtures has been discussed in Section 3.2.3,
where it is noted that the prediction of this property requires vapour–
liquid  equilibrium  calculations.  For  the  flammability  of  pure  com-
ponents  there  are  several  GC  methods  that  are  either  based  on  the
prediction of the flash point [488] or on the calculation of upper and
lower flammability limits [489–492]. The latter properties may be cal-
culated by accounting for the oxidation reaction of generic formulas of
organic compounds and for molecular characteristics such as the length
of the carbon skeleton, the type of bonds in the molecule and others.
For  ODP  and  GWP  of  pure  components,  there  are  GC  methods
available  [338,488],  although  these  are  not  comprehensive  for  all
compounds. For example, GC methods are available for ODP of one-
and two-carbon HFCs and HCFCs [493], and for one- and two-carbon
CFCs [494]; the more-recent method of Al et al. [495] is applicable to
CFCs, HCFCs, and haloalkanes. GC methods for predicting GWPs [495–
497] are applicable to a somewhat wider range of species, although still
focused on refrigerants and related fluids. In this context, we mention
also GC methods for radiative efficiency [498,499], upon which the
GWP is based.

In Section 3.2.3, we have mentioned the existence of holistic sus-
tainability assessment frameworks that have been used in both CAMD
[100] and CAMPD [188]. The first framework takes a cradle-to-gate
approach, whereby the sustainability features of the fluids are calcu-
lated for both fluid production and fluid use. The calculations for the
fluid use are based on pure-component properties, without accounting
for the fluid quantities that are necessary and that may eventually vary
the impacts of the fluids. In this context, the sustainability performance
of  the  fluids  is  summarised  into  environmental,  health,  and  safety
scores  which  are  calculated  by  various  properties.  The  environmen-
tal score includes water- and air-mediated effects, accumulation into
organisms and degradation in the environment of the chemicals. The

C.N. Markides et al.

health impacts are associated with chronic toxicity, whereas the safety
impacts  are  calculated  from  the  mobility,  fire  potential,  and  acute
toxicity of the chemicals. The sustainability performance during fluid
production  is  used  to  assess  the  impacts  of  the  production  stage  of
the fluids and considers its cumulative energy demand, GWP, and eco-
indicator 99 (EI99), which includes 11 properties that are associated
with the environmental impact. The environmental impacts of chemical
production were predicted from an ANN in this work [500], but they
can also be predicted through a GC model [501], or machine-learning-
based models [502]. A key feature of this work is a systematic approach
to deal with data gaps in property models. In the absence of data, a data
mining approach is used which deploys on-line similarity assessment
against molecules whose properties are available or can be predicted
through the employed models.

A cradle-to-grave approach for sustainability assessment in CAMPD
has  been  demonstrated  by  Fleitmann  et  al.  [188],  in  the  so-called
COSMO-susCAMPD framework. The authors demonstrate the approach
for  the  integrated  design  of  benign  solvents  and  hybrid  extraction–
distillation processes. To capture the environmental impacts of solvent
production,  the  authors  integrate  a  predictive  life-cycle-assessment
(LCA) framework based on Kleinekorte et al. [502,503] into the COSMO-
CAMPD framework, previously published by Scheffczyk et al. [504].
The predictive LCA framework is based on an ANN using molecular
descriptors such as structure information or thermodynamic properties
calculated from COSMO-RS. The environmental impacts of the solvent
use are calculated using life-cycle inventory data directly obtained from
the employed process model. The end-of-life of the solvent is modelled
using an aggregated process model from the literature for wastewater
treatment. The work highlights the importance of cradle-to-grave life
cycle  assessment  in  CAMPD  for  the  design  of  environmentally  be-
nign fluids, as simplified cradle-to-gate or economic assessments alone
can lead to suboptimal fluid selections. While the authors apply the
COSMO-susCAMPD framework for a chemical-engineering application,
the approach can be easily transferred to the design of working fluids
for organic Rankine cycles.

In recent years, significant efforts have been observed for the pre-
diction of various such properties through machine learning (ML) ap-
proaches. In typical GC methods, the property prediction model and the
number of model parameters are fixed, whereas the latter are regressed
through an appropriate algorithm. In GC-ML models, the number of
parameters and the model structure are not fixed a priori [505]. There
are various important properties that may be predicted through such
methods, including toxicity, bioconcentration factor, auto-ignition tem-
perature, photochemical oxidation potential, and others [506]. Purely
ML-based models have also been developed for the prediction of the
product  carbon  footprint  of  chemicals  such  as  FineChem  2  [507],
which  has  evolved  from  the  ANN  (FineChem)  developed  by  Wernet
et  al.  [500],  or  APPROPRIATE  [502],  which  is  based  on  Gaussian
process regression combined with an encoder–decoder neural network.

5.  Computer-aided molecular and process design for organic Rank-
ine cycles

CAMPD  for  organic  Rankine  cycles  aims  to  identify  an  optimal
working fluid (or mixture) jointly with the corresponding ORC system
that  optimise  an  objective  for  a  given  ORC  application.  An  optimal
combination  of  working  fluid  and  ORC  system  can  be  identified  by
directly linking ORC optimisation to a CAMD formulation. CAMD for-
mulations allow for the in silico design of novel working fluids [134].
For this purpose, molecular building blocks are combined to molecular
structures while still fulfilling chemical constraints. Thereby, a large
molecular design space can be considered to select optimal working
fluids.  The  link  between  a  CAMD  formulation  and  the  ORC  system
model  is  most  commonly  established  using  GC  approaches.  In  GC
approaches,  each  functional  group  has  a  contribution  to  a  certain

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

physical  property  or  parameters  used  as  input  of  a  thermodynamic-
property model (cf., Section 4). By linking the ORC system optimisation
to  CAMD,  working  fluids  can  be  chosen  as  a  degree  of  freedom  of
the ORC system optimisation and designed simultaneously to the ORC
conditions considering an objective function of the ORC system. Such
an integrated design thus leads to an optimal combination of working
fluid and ORC system for the considered design space (see Fig. 16).

5.1.  General CAMPD problem formulation

The origins of CAMPD can be traced back to chemical-engineering
problems, e.g., aiming to identify optimal solvents for separation pro-
cesses [508]. CAMPD problems are usually nonlinear due to the process
and thermodynamic property models. Moreover, CAMPD problems gen-
erally  include  discrete  degrees  of  freedom, e.g.,  binary  variables,  to
represent the molecular structure and the cycle configuration. Thus,
mathematically, CAMPD problems can be formulated as mixed-integer
nonlinear programmes [508]. A general MINLP problem formulation
for CAMPD of pure molecules is given in Problem (1):

(f1(x, y), f2(x, y), ... , fk (x, y))T

min
x,y
s.t.  h(x, y) = 0
g(x, y) ≤ 0
k(y) ≤ 0

The  CAMPD  model  minimises  a  set  of  objective  functions fi of
an ORC system. These objective functions are commonly either ther-
modynamic objectives, e.g., the ORC thermal efficiency or net power
output,  or  thermo-economic  objectives, e.g.,  specific  investment  cost
or net present value. The objective functions depend on the cycle and
equipment variables x and the molecular structure of the working fluid
y. The cycle and equipment variables x can be continuous variables
(e.g., pressure levels or the degree of superheating after evaporation)
or discrete variables (e.g., the number of turbine stages or binaries de-
scribing the ORC configuration). The objective functions are minimised
subject to equality constraints h and inequality constraints g and k. The
equality constraints h represent the cycle and equipment models (e.g.,
energy balances of the processes or sizing/costing correlations of the
equipment) and the property model of the working fluid. The inequality
constraints g represent design or operational limitations that ensure the
feasibility of the application (e.g., pressure limits or minimal approach
temperatures) and limitations on molecular properties ensuring com-
pliance with regulations or technical restrictions (e.g., flammability or
toxicity of the working fluid). The inequality constraints k represent the
CAMD formulation and provide the structural feasibility of the working
fluid  during  the  molecular  design, e.g..  For  example,  the  octet  rule
prevents open bonds in molecular structures, while specific equations
ensure the correct number of functional groups for ring structures or
double bonds (for details, see Refs. [509,510]). The CAMPD problem
in  Problem (1) generally  includes  continuous  and  discrete  degrees
of freedom of the cycle processes and equipment x and the discrete
degrees of freedom of the molecular structure of the working fluid y.
Solving the MINLP optimisation problem (Problem (1)) results in
the optimal working fluid jointly with the optimal ORC system. Ranking
the  most-promising  working  fluids  is  usually  beneficial  to  account
for  model  uncertainties.  Moreover,  such  a  ranking  enables  assessing
properties  not  captured  within  the  integrated  design  due  to  miss-
ing predictive models (e.g., chemical or thermal stability). The most-
promising  working  fluids  can  be  ranked  by  solving  the  MINLP  re-
peatedly, considering additional constraints. The so-called integer-cut
constraints prevent finding molecular structures identified in previous
optimisations [511,512].

The integrated design problem can be extended to mixtures.  For
this  purpose,  models  for  the  cycle  processes,  equipment,  and  ther-
modynamic properties must accurately capture the mixture behaviour
within the ORC processes. The design of mixtures can be enabled by
a computer-aided mixture and blend design (CAMbD) formulation. In
a CAMbD formulation, each mixture component is represented by its
molecular  structure,  and  constraints  ensure  the  structural  feasibility
of each molecular structure [139]. Furthermore, inequality constraints
can  be  added  to  the  design  problem  to  break  the  symmetry  of  the
molecular design space and prevent the design of identical molecular
structures of the components. Those inequality constraints avoid local
optima and reduce redundancy, leading to more efficient optimisation
by preventing the search algorithm from getting stuck in symmetric,
equivalent solutions. The integrated design of mixtures can choose the
number of components in the mixture, the molecular structure of each
component, and the concentration of each component in the mixture as
degrees of freedom of the integrated design problem (cf., Section 3.1).
However, the integrated design of mixtures increases the complexity
and is thus more challenging to solve.

The  tremendous  molecular  design  space  of  possible  working  flu-
ids [513] makes solving the MINLP of the integrated design challenging
in practice. The challenge of the MINLP is tackled by systematic design
methods [134,337]. The developed systematic design methods can be
distinguished according to the assessment criteria used to reflect the
actual ORC performance (i.e., the objective functions fi in Problem (1)):

(1) Molecular-design problems based on simplified performance in-
dicators using physical-property targets (Section 5.1.1); and
(2) Integrated molecular and process design problems using thermo-

dynamic or thermo-economic objectives (Section 5.1.2).

The following discussion in this section is focused on CAMPD so-
lution strategies for ORC systems. An overview of these strategies is
given in Table 4. For a detailed overview of CAMPD solution strategies
for energy and chemical engineering problems, the reader is referred
to the review of Papadopoulos et al. [134].

5.1.1.  Molecular design

Molecular-design problems aim to reduce the model complexity of
the CAMPD problem by first reducing the molecular design space based

on physical-property targets, whereas the resulting small, pre-selected
set of working fluids is then optimised regarding ORC system perfor-
mance. The pre-selection step employs a CAMD formulation in a single-
or multi-objective optimisation, using one or more physical-property
targets  as  the  objective  function.  These  property  targets,  crucial  for
maximising  ORC  system  performance,  must  be  defined  using  expert
knowledge  and  tailored  to  specific  applications,  e.g.,  by  accounting
for  heat  source  and  sink  temperatures.  Subsequently,  the  identified
working  fluids  are  evaluated  in  detailed  ORC  system  optimisations.
In  contrast  to  traditional  working-fluid  selection  (cf.,  Section 3.1),
molecular-design  problems  typically  consider  a  larger  molecular  de-
sign space in the initial fluid pre-selection. Since process information
is not required in the molecular-design problem of the pre-selection
step, he working-fluid design can be separated from the ORC system
design. Consequently, Problem (1) is simplified to the molecular-design
problem by neglecting the ORC processes and equipment equality and
inequality constraints and degrees of freedom. As a result, the CAMPD
problem is transformed into a simplified CAMD problem. The molecular
properties are typically calculated from the molecular structure of the
working fluid using GC approaches (cf., Section 4).

In early work, Papadopoulos et al. [98] proposed a CAMD method
for ORC working-fluid design, which combines a CAMD formulation
with  GC  approaches  for  pure-component  molecular-property  predic-
tion. A multi-objective molecular-design problem is solved in the first
step to capture the trade-off among several target properties. In this
problem formulation, five objective functions are considered to asso-
ciate the generated molecular structures with cycle process targets: the
density, latent heat of vaporisation, and thermal conductivity of the
working fluid are maximised, and the liquid heat capacity and viscosity
of  the  working  fluid  are  minimised.  Simultaneously,  constraints  are
considered on the melting-point temperature and critical temperature.
The multi-objective molecular-design problem results in a set of Pareto-
optimal molecules. In the subsequent step, these molecules are assessed
in ORC system simulations, also considering safety and environmental
molecular properties. The computational effort is reduced by identi-
fying  molecular  clusters  from  the  Pareto-optimal  working  fluids.  In
the  last  step,  the  most-promising  working  fluids  are  selected  from
each cluster and assessed in a detailed ORC system optimisation. The

proposed method identifies both conventional and novel working fluids
outperforming working fluids proposed in the literature. Thus, the work
highlights the advantages of CAMD for ORC working-fluid design. The
multi-objective  CAMD  formulation  is  used  to  avoid  the  assumption
that any particular pure-component property captures the ORC process
performance drivers better than another. The considered properties are
reasonable in terms of reflecting typical working-fluid requirements in
the ORC, but they are not exhaustive, and the possibility of considering
additional properties may not be excluded.

Palma-Flores et al. [137] analysed suitable physical-property targets
to design working fluids for ORCs. Based on guidelines and rules for
working-fluid  selection,  the  authors  defined  four  objective  functions
for the CAMD problem as combinations of molecular properties of the
working  fluid, i.e.,  the  enthalpy  of  vaporisation  and  the  liquid  heat
capacity of the working fluid, and the Gibbs energy of formation of
the ideal gas. The four objective functions are considered in individual
single-objective molecular-design problems. Subsequently, the identi-
fied working fluids are assessed in detailed process optimisations for
three  cycle  configurations.  From  the  optimisations,  the  authors  con-
cluded that the most-promising working fluids can be identified for the
considered ORC applications by minimising the liquid heat capacity of
the working fluids because the heat duty in the evaporator is decreased.
Due to uncertainties in property prediction, Andrés-Martínez and
Flores-Tlacuahuac [514] extended the work by an uncertainty analysis
and a robust formulation of the linear constraints. Thereby, GC model
uncertainties are considered during working-fluid design. The frame-
work  identifies  working  fluids  that  are  robust  against  uncertainties
in  property  prediction  and  different  from  those  identified  without
considering GC model uncertainties.

The use of simplified cycle indicators based on physical-property
targets enables the fast, straightforward, and robust design of molecular
structures without the need for detailed modelling. The thermodynamic-
property  models  that  could  be  used  to  predict  the  desired  physical
properties  may  range  from  empirical  models  to  robust  EoS,  such  as
SAFT (cf. Section 4). The molecular-design approaches described above
result in promising working fluids compared to the traditional working-
fluid selection, as shown by their subsequent performance assessment
through  ORC  system  simulations  or  in  comparison  with  third-party
investigations [148]. However, optimal target properties are typically
case-specific,  and  defining  proper  physical-property  targets  thus  re-
quires experience with the investigated system and its specifications,
which  is  often  missing  or  unreliable.  For  example,  the  critical  tem-
perature of the working fluid should align with the maximum cycle
temperature, which is influenced by the heat source temperature, to
ensure the cycle operates in subcritical or supercritical conditions [98].
Typically, the rules and guidelines from the traditional working-fluid
selection  (cf.,  Section 3.1)  are  used  to  define  the  physical  property
targets. However, knowing a priori which molecular property represents
the  ORC  performance  of  a  specific  application  most  accurately  in  a
single-  or  multi-objective  optimisation  is  impossible.  For  chemical-
engineering applications, Kossack et al. [515] have shown in early work
that a single-objective CAMD approach may result in a different optimal
solution  than  a  CAMPD  approach  using  a  process-based  objective.
MOO  formulations  allow  the  capture  of  multiple  physical-property
targets  and  their  trade-offs  simultaneously,  reducing  the  probabil-
ity of excluding promising working fluids. However, even for MOO,
it  is  challenging  to  know a  priori how  many  and  which  physical
properties  precisely  would  capture  the  working-fluid  behaviour  in
the ORC sufficiently. Considering different sets of objective functions
or Pareto-approximation algorithms may affect the generated Pareto
fronts, leading to the inclusion or omission of working fluids. More-
over, different pressures and temperatures are observed in the cycle
depending on the working fluid. Such varying cycle conditions may not
be captured by considering solely pure-component physical properties.
These challenges can be tackled in an integrated CAMPD formulation
considering an objective function that captures all trade-offs. Using an

ORC  system  model  in  a  CAMPD  formulation  considers  all  necessary
cycle  processes  and  conditions,  as  well  as  heat  transfer,  and  other
phenomena in the ORC equipment while evaluating the working fluids
using thermodynamic and/or sizing and economic indicators. In this
context, CAMPD approaches may result in different optimal working
fluids than CAMD approaches based solely on physical properties.

5.1.2.  Integrated molecular and process design

The  previously  presented  shortcomings  of  approaches  based  on
molecular-property  indicators  can  be  overcome  by  considering  ORC
system-related objective functions for working-fluid design [48,337].
Thus, a substantial effort has been made in the last decade to solve
the integrated molecular and process design problem as formulated in
Problem (1). ORC system-related objective functions assess the perfor-
mance of a working fluid within an ORC system and thus need reliable
knowledge of the thermodynamic behaviour of the working fluid. The
thermodynamic behaviour of a molecule can be estimated using predic-
tive thermodynamic-property models (cf., Section 4). Thermodynamic-
property  models  link  information  on  the  molecular  structure  to  the
thermodynamic  properties  of  a  molecule.  The  thermodynamic  prop-
erties  can  be  used  for  ORC  modelling,  yielding  ORC  system-related
objective functions. The employed thermodynamic-property model de-
fines which model can be used and, thus, the objective function(s) and
constraints of Problem (1). For example, a thermodynamic-equilibrium
model  enables  the  development  of  an  ORC  model  based  on  phase
equilibrium, mass, and energy balances, while additional models for
transport  properties  are  required  for  the  sizing  (and,  if  considering
economic indicators, also the costing) of the equipment.

Integrated thermodynamic design with steady-state operation
A basic thermodynamic ORC model based on equilibrium thermody-
namics requires equilibrium properties of the working fluid (e.g., den-
sities, enthalpies, or entropies) and, thus, a thermodynamic-property
model (cf., Section 4). In CAMPD for ORCs, most commonly, an EoS
is used as the thermodynamic-property model combined with GC ap-
proaches to calculate the parameters representing a working fluid in
the  EoS  from  its  molecular  structure.  A  thermodynamic  ORC  model
enables the consideration of thermodynamic objective functions (e.g.,
the ORC net power output or thermal efficiency) and constraints (e.g.,
limits on the pressure levels). Due to its simplicity, the first systematic
design methods developed to solve the CAMPD problem for ORCs were
focused on a thermodynamic ORC model.

In 2014 and 2015, Lampe et al. [51,419] proposed the so-called
continuous-molecular  targeting  —  computer-aided  molecular  design
(CoMT-CAMD) approach for ORCs, which decomposes the integrated
design problem in two subproblems (cf., Fig. 17). The idea of the CoMT-
CAMD approach originates from the work of Bardow et al. [57] on
solvent selection for separation processes. Initially, the discrete fluid
parameters  are  relaxed,  representing  the  working  fluid  in  the  used
thermodynamic-property model; here, the PC-SAFT EoS was adopted.
The continuous molecular representation enables the identification of
favourable  working-fluid  properties,  so-called  targets,  by  optimising
the  molecular  parameters  within  an  ORC  optimisation.  In  a  second
step, real working fluids are identified with performance closest to the
target either based on screening a database [51] or designing working
fluids using CAMD [419,425] and homosegmented GC approach of PC-
SAFT  [445].  Importantly,  the  objective  function  in  this  second  step
approximates  the  objective  used  in  the  targeting  step  and  does  not
simply aim to identify real working fluids with parameters closest to the
target, as sometimes misinterpreted in the literature. The distance in
parameter space depends on scaling and does not capture the different
impacts  of  different  properties  on  the  objective.  A  detailed  descrip-
tion of the solution strategy of the CoMT-CAMD method is given in
Section 5.2.

Another decomposition method based on a continuous molecular
representation has been proposed by Roskosch and Atakan [516] for

36

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

Su  et  al.  [488]  similarly  use  simple  GC  approaches  for  property
prediction in their working-fluid design method. However, the authors
solve the integrated design problem using a generate-and-test strategy,
which can only be solved efficiently for a small molecular design space
(cf., Section 5.2.1).

Simple GC approaches are fast and straightforward for thermody
namic-property prediction but lack a consistent thermodynamic basis
and, thus, accuracy. The accuracy of property prediction can be im-
proved  by  using  a  thermodynamic-property  model  like  an  EoS  (cf.,
Section 4).  Cignitti  et  al.  [518]  proposed  a  CAMPD  method  for  the
integrated design of ORCs and working fluids using the SRK EoS [302]
and GC approaches for the parameters representing a molecule in the
EoS. The MINLP is solved using an MINLP solver from the literature.
The authors compare the results to traditional working-fluid selection
and a decomposed molecular design and demonstrate the advantages of
the integrated design in both the performance of the identified working
fluids and the computational efficiency of the approach.

Due to the uncertainty in property prediction, Frutiger et al. [519]
extended  the  work  of  Cignitti  et  al.  [518]  by  a  Monte  Carlo-based
uncertainty analysis and analysed the impact of property uncertainties
on  the  identified  ranking  of  the  best  working  fluids.  The  proposed
method determines a ranking of promising working fluids jointly with
a probability distribution, indicating how likely a working fluid is to
be the best solution depending on the chosen uncertainties. The prob-
ability distribution supports a reliable selection of working fluids and
reduces the risk of suboptimal solutions due to property uncertainties.
The results highlight the need for accurate property prediction models
within an integrated design framework.

In general, cubic EoS are simple and reliable. However, they are
known for limited model accuracy for mixtures with non-ideal fluid
behaviour, e.g.,  polar  mixtures  [347].  Thus,  for  mixture  modelling,
cubic EoS are often combined with GE models requiring an assessment
of thermodynamic consistency (cf., Section 4).

The impact of property uncertainties on the ranking can be reduced
by using an EoS based on SAFT, which has strong predictive power
for  liquid,  vapour,  and  supercritical  phases  even  for  mixtures  with
non-ideal  behaviour  (cf.,  Section 4.4).  In  one  of  the  earliest  direct
integrated  design  methods,  Schilling  et  al.  [424]  used  the  PC-SAFT
EoS [144] and the corresponding homosegmented GC approach [445]
as the thermodynamic-property model. The method is based on Lampe
et al. [419] but directly integrates the CAMD formulation into the ini-
tial targeting stage, enabling the solution of the MINLP in an integrated
optimisation. A commercial MINLP solver based on outer approxima-
tion (cf., Fig. 18 (a)) is used to solve the integrated design problem.
The MINLP solver initially relaxes the discrete molecular degrees of
freedom as in the continuous-molecular targeting framework [419] (see
Section 5.2).

The method is thus called 1-stage CoMT-CAMD. The authors showed
that an integrated solution of the MINLP improves the robustness and
quality  of  the  results  compared  to  the  decomposition-based  CoMT-
CAMD method of Lampe et al. [419]. The work thus highlights the
advantages of a fully integrated solution. The authors integrated the
1-stage CoMT-CAMD method into the commercial software gPROMS
ProcessBuilder [327]. Recently, the two-stage CoMT-CAMD approach
has also been integrated into the in-house simulator of BASF SE [520].
Both  integrations  enable  using  model  libraries  and,  thus,  a  straight-
forward  and  efficient  definition  of  the  ORC  system  and  the  overall
integrated design problem [423]. Besides the integrated design of work-
ing fluids and ORCs, 1-stage CoMT-CAMD has also been successfully
applied to the integrated design of refrigerants and compression heat
pumps by Neumaier et al. [521] and refrigerants and adsorption chillers
by Mayer et al. [522]. The homo-segmented GC method of PC-SAFT
was also used by Wang et al. [523]. The authors solved the CAMPD
problem using a generate-and-test strategy (cf., Section 5.2.1) and were
thus limited to small molecular design space for efficient computation.

refrigerant  design  for  compression  heat  pumps  and  applied  to  ORC
working-fluid design [517], using the Peng–Robinson EoS [307]. The
working fluids are characterised by their critical temperature and pres-
sure, the acentric factor, and parameters of a correlation of the ideal-gas
heat capacity. These discrete fluid parameters are initially treated as
continuous within ORC optimisation. Subsequently, real working fluids
are identified by screening a database using an approximation of the
objective function around the hypothetical, optimal working fluid as
an assessment criterion.

Decomposing the integrated design problem into smaller subprob-
lems allows for a computationally efficient solution while still high-
lighting  the  benefits  of  system-related  assessment  criteria.  However,
the decomposition can introduce inaccuracies, which do not guarantee
global optimal solutions [134].

The  shortcomings  of  decomposition  methods  can  be  tackled  by
directly solving the integrated design problem in a single step. Such
a direct solution to the integrated design problem has been supported
in the past years by improved MINLP solvers and numerical techniques.
Palma-Flores et al. [329] have presented the earliest work to our knowl-
edge, which solves the MINLP problem of the integrated design of the
ORC systems and working fluids in a single step. The study builds upon
their earlier work on molecular design [137] but now directly links a
thermodynamic model of the ORC to the GC approaches used to predict
thermodynamic  properties  and  the  CAMD  formulation.  A  numerical
solver from the literature is used to solve the MINLP considering three
cycle configurations (see Section 5.2). The authors highlight that the
integrated  CAMPD  identifies  better  working  fluids  than  a  molecular
design based on simplified indicators using physical-property targets.

In addition to PC-SAFT, a powerful SAFT-based fluid model is the
predictive SAFT-γ Mie group-contribution EoS [79,145], used by White
et al. [447] for integrated ORC design. The authors reduced the com-
putational complexity within the proposed framework by decomposing
the molecular design space and solving individual MINLP optimisations
for n-alkanes, methyl alkanes, 1-alkenes, and 2-alkenes. The developed
integrated  design  method  has  been  applied  for  industrially  relevant
ORC  waste-heat-recovery  applications.  Beyond  integrated  thermody-
namic design, the authors discussed the identified working fluids in
detail regarding their relevant characteristics within an ORC system,
considering a simple model of a radial turbine [447] and sizing models
for the heat exchangers and their thermo-economic performance using
cost  correlation  for  the  equipment  [146].  The  work  underlines  the
good performance of SAFT-based thermodynamic-property models for
integrated molecular and power-cycle design frameworks.

However, increasing model complexity increases the computational
time and the possibility that algorithms fail for diverse design spaces.
One of the main challenges for a robust algorithm is working fluids
tested  during  the  optimisation  (either  real  or  hypothetical  working
fluids), which are infeasible for the considered ORC system due to a
mismatch between the physical properties and the process constraints
(e.g., the saturation temperatures within the given pressure range is
higher than the ORC heat-source temperature).

Therefore,  Bowskill  et  al.  [450]  proposed  an  integrated  design
framework for ORCs based on the SAFT-γ Mie GC EoS, which extends
an outer-approximation algorithm with a physical domain reduction
by feasibility tests (cf., Fig. 18(b)). The work is based on the CAMPD
framework developed by Gopinath et al. [60] for the integrated design
of solvents and separation processes. The feasibility tests of physical
properties before the ORC optimisation reduce the execution of infea-
sible evaluations. Thus, the framework enables a faster and more robust
integrated  design  and  allows  consideration  of  a  more  extensive  and
diverse  molecular  design  space  (i.e.,  functional  groups  for  branched
alkanes, alkenes, ethers, esters, carboxylic acids, and 1-alcohols).

The CAMD formulations typically used in CAMPD methods for ORCs
describe the molecular structures by the number of occurrences of a
certain molecular group within the molecular structure. Such CAMD
formulations are efficient and can be used with gradient-based opti-
misation if a proper thermodynamic-property model is used. However,
the underlying molecular representation also has two disadvantages for
CAMPD: (1) isomers cannot be distinguished; and (2) the CAMPD meth-
ods are limited to thermodynamic-property models that depend on the
group counts solely (e.g., classical GC methods). These disadvantages
can be overcome by more-advanced CAMPD formulations. Recently,
Rehner et al. [452] proposed a graph-based molecular representation,
the  so-called  molecule  superstructure,  an  approach  inspired  by  the
superstructures developed for flowsheet optimisation in chemical and
energy engineering. The graph-based molecule superstructure includes
the full connectivity information of the molecular groups and can thus
distinguish between isomers. Moreover, the proposed molecule super-
structure can be relaxed and thus be used within gradient-based opti-
misation algorithms. Due to the additional information on the group
connectivity,  higher-fidelity  thermodynamic-property  models  can  be
used within CAMPD, as, for example, demonstrated by the authors for
the hetero-segmented PC-SAFT EoS [445].

Equipment sizing, costing and integrated thermo-economic design
Thermodynamic  process  and  cycle  models  based  on  equilibrium
thermodynamics enable an efficient integrated design of working fluids
based on thermodynamic objectives. However, thermodynamic models
neglect equipment sizing (and costing) and thus have some shortcom-
ings, which can lead to suboptimal solutions:

(1) Fluid-dependent  parameters  are  usually  fixed, e.g.,  the  isen-
tropic turbine efficiency, neglecting significant impacts of fluid
behaviour  on  overall  operation  and  performance  [524]  (cf.;
Section 3.4);

38

C.N. Markides et al.

(2) The practical implementation of the optimum designs introduces
additional  design  degrees  of  freedom  and  constraints  of  the
equipment that could change significantly the anticipated ther-
modynamic and economic performance of the ORC system and
fluid [273]; and

(3) Thermodynamic models do not ensure economically competitive

ORC systems.

Thus,  the  integrated  design  of  ORC  systems  and  working  fluids
should  include  equipment  sizing  and  costing  to  capture  all  relevant
system-wide trade-offs. Sizing the equipment often requires additional
thermophysical properties like transport properties (e.g., viscosity or
thermal  conductivity)  and  thus  the  integration  of  proper  property
models (cf., Section 4.7). Lampe et al. [273] captured the impact of
the working fluid on the ORC turbine by integrating a model of a one-
stage radial inflow turbine into the 1-stage CoMT-CAMD framework
developed by Schilling et al. [424]. The model enables the calculation
of fluid-dependent isentropic turbine efficiencies and crucial turbine
design parameters, e.g., blade heights, Mach numbers, and rotational
speeds, limited within the integrated design. The authors showed that
limiting turbine design parameters can strongly influence the ranking of
the best working fluids, and that neglecting the turbine sizing can lead
to infeasible turbine geometries for the identified optimal fluids and
corresponding process settings. Thus, the study of Lampe et al. [273]
highlights  the  need  for  capturing  equipment  behaviour  within  the
working-fluid design.

Schilling  et  al.  [274]  extended  the  1-stage  CoMT-CAMD  frame-
work  [424]  by  equipment  models  for  sizing  heat  exchangers.  The
equipment  models  capture  the  heat  transfer  for  single-phase,  evap-
oration,  and  condensation.  For  this  purpose,  the  authors  integrated
advanced models for calculating viscosity [471] and thermal conduc-
tivity [475] of molecules into the framework. These recently developed
models  for  transport  properties  are  based  on  the  PC-SAFT  EoS  and
entropy  scaling  (cf.,  Section 4.7).  Thus,  equilibrium  and  transport
properties are modelled consistently within the integrated design. The
equipment sizing enables the calculation of the cost of the purchased
equipment  using  costing  correlations  and,  therefore,  the  investment
cost of the ORC. Thereby, a thermo-economic objective function can be
considered for the integrated design (e.g., the specific investment cost
or the net present value of the ORC). The authors demonstrated that the
optimal working fluid identified using a thermo-economic objective can
differ from that identified using a thermodynamic objective. Similarly,
van Kleef et al. [275] integrated a thermo-economic assessment into
the framework developed by White et al. [146,447]. For this purpose,
the  authors  used  GC  approaches  for  transport  properties  (cf.,  Sec-
tion 4.7). Moreover, equipment models for sizing the heat exchangers
and costing are directly linked to their integrated design framework.
The  trade-off  between  thermodynamic  and  thermo-economic  perfor-
mance was analysed using MOO. The authors investigated the impact
of  the  ORC  heat-source  temperature  on  the  working  fluid  ranking
and identify novel working fluids for ORC applications. Both Schilling
et  al.  [274]  and  van  Kleef  et  al.  [275]  highlighted  the  need  for  in-
tegrated equipment sizing and a thermo-economic assessment for the
integrated  design  of  working  fluids  and  ORC  systems.  However,  in-
tegrating  equipment  sizing  and  cost  estimation  models  into  CAMPD
problems  can  introduce  considerable  uncertainties,  primarily  due  to
cost estimations [525]. These uncertainties can worsen the accuracy
of the objective function and constraints, potentially leading to less re-
liable optimisation results. A key aspect is whether these uncertainties
result in systematic errors across all working fluids, keeping the ranking
unchanged,  or  if  they  vary  based  on  the  specific  working  fluid  and
consequently can change the ranking. The impact of these uncertainties
on  the  working  fluid  ranking  must  be  carefully  assessed  to  ensure
that the thermo-economic design remains robust despite the inherent
uncertainties in cost estimations.

The integrated design methods discussed so far allow for the inte-
grated ORC and working-fluid design for a fixed ORC configuration.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

This  limit  was  overcome  by  Schilling  et  al.  [428],  who  integrated
a  superstructure  of  the  ORC  system  into  the  1-stage  CoMT-CAMD
framework  [274].  Thereby,  the  authors  can  design  the  ORC  system
simultaneously with the working fluid. The superstructure of the ORC
system consists of optional internal heat regeneration, turbine bleeding,
and  reheating.  The  optimisation  algorithm  can  choose  these  options
by  additional  discrete  degrees  of  freedom.  The  whole  framework  is
integrated into the software gPROMS ProcessBuilder [327]. Thereby,
the superstructure of the ORC configuration can be defined straight-
forwardly using equipment model libraries. The framework identifies
the thermo-economically optimal working fluid jointly with the optimal
ORC configuration, cycle settings, and equipment sizes. The authors
showed that the optimal working fluid and cycle configuration depends
on the chosen objective function. The work highlights the impact of the
ORC configuration on the working-fluid selection. In recent work, Till-
manns et al. [526] applied the 1-stage CoMT-CAMD framework to the
integrated thermo-economic design of an ORC-based pumped-thermal
electricity storage (PTES) system. The authors designed the working
fluid for an ORC and the refrigerant for a heat pump simultaneously, to
obtain an optimal interaction between the ORC and heat pump within
the  PTES  system.  The  work  used  the  gPROMS  ProcessBuilder  [327]
implementation of 1-stage CoMT-CAMD and corresponding equipment
model libraries. The authors demonstrated the possibility of integrating
CAMPD for ORCs in the design of larger background systems involving
several thermodynamic cycles with a molecular degree of freedom.

Integrated design for off-design operation
The solution methods discussed so far focus on designing optimal
working fluids for ORC systems with steady-state operation or a nomi-
nal operating point. However, heat sources can be transient, and thus,
ORC  systems  have  to  be  operated  at  varying  off-design  conditions.
Because the heat source strongly impacts working-fluid selection [48],
fluids selected for a fixed heat source can be suboptimal if the real
heat-source behaviour is transient [312,527]. Thus, identifying optimal
working fluids for off-design operation needs an integrated design that
can capture the transient behaviour. In general, off-design operation
can be captured using dynamic models. Considering dynamic models
for integrated design leads to a computer-aided molecular process and
control  design  (CAMPCD)  problem  [134].  Mathematically,  CAMPCD
problems can be formulated as mixed-integer optimal control problems
(MIOCPs), which are challenging to solve.

Schilling et al. [427] captured the transient behaviour of the heat
source by considering multiple operating points in the so-called 1-stage
continuous-molecular  targeting-computer-aided  molecular  and  multi-
operating  process  design  (1-stage  CoMT-CAM2PD).  Thereby,  solving
challenging  optimal  control  problems  is  prevented.  The  authors  de-
scribed  the  transient  heat-source  behaviour  by  a  time  series  of  the
steady-state  heat-source  settings  (i.e.,  heat-source  temperature  and
mass  flow  rate).  From  this  time  series,  operating  points  were  se-
lected for the integrated design based on time-series aggregation tech-
niques [528]. The framework assumes quasi-steady-state operation and
identifies the working fluids with optimal thermodynamic properties in
the given range of off-design operations. The authors showed that work-
ing fluids identified considering multiple operating points outperform
those identified with only a single nominal operating point.

While quasi-steady-state models are efficient and robust for working-
fluid selection in early design stages, they do not capture the inertia
and dynamic response of ORC systems. Thus, quasi-steady-state models
cannot be used to find an optimal match of working fluid and ORC
control strategy [529]. The heat source up to the ORC system is not
always steady state, but is in fluctuation, especially the engine heat
source,  which  exhibits  a  rapid  fluctuation  with  a  fluctuation  period
on the second-minute level [262,530]. The off-design performance of
different  working  fluids  is  not  the  same,  so  it  is  necessary  to  study
the  design  of  working  fluids  in  ORC  in  transient  states.  Therefore,
Tillmanns  et  al.  [276]  directly  integrated  dynamic  models  for  the

39

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

ORC  equipment  into  the  two-stage  CoMT-CAMD  method  proposed
by  Lampe  et  al.  [419].  The  integration  transforms  the  initial  NLP
relaxation problem (i.e., the continuous-molecular targeting) into an
optimal  control  problem  (OCP).  The  entire  problem  is  implemented
into  the  software  Modelica  [531]  and  solved  using  the  commercial
OCP solver MUSCOD-II [532]. MUSCOD-II is a robust multiple-shooting
OCP solver that efficiently handles complex dynamic systems by solving
time intervals simultaneously. In order to have a better symbolisation,
a  sine  was  used  to  represent  the  transient  state  of  the  heat  source,
which is a commonly used method [533,534]. As a result of the OCP, a
hypothetical, optimal working fluid is identified with the corresponding
optimal ORC settings and control strategy. In the second stage, real
working fluids are identified using CAMD according to the previous
CoMT-CAMD method. The authors highlighted the advantages of inte-
grating dynamic ORC modelling and integrated working fluid and ORC
design for applications with a strong impact of the transient behaviour.
Due  to  the  challenges  of  dynamic  system  operation,  the  developed
method relies on a decomposition strategy and is limited to a small
molecular  design  space.  Moreover,  both  methods  developed  for  an
integrated design with transient ORC behaviour only consider the ther-
modynamic performance of the cycle, neglecting the equipment cost.
Nevertheless, the proposed methods underline the need for capturing
transient behaviour for selecting working fluids for ORC systems within
an integrated design framework.

5.1.3.  Integrated mixture and process design problem

The  systematic  design  methods  discussed  in  Section 5.1.2 focus
on the integrated design of ORCs and pure working fluids. However,
working-fluid mixtures can have favourable properties for ORCs due to
the temperature-glide during evaporation and condensation [21]. As for
pure components, finding an optimal combination of a working-fluid
mixture and ORC requires an objective function related to the wider
ORC system within the design. The problem formulation in Problem (1)
can be extended to design working-fluid mixtures. For this purpose, the
following requirements have to be considered:

(1) A thermodynamic-property model is needed to predict mixture

behaviour (see Section 4);

(2) The  process  and  equipment-sizing/costing  models  have  to  be
extended for mixtures. For example, appropriate models need
to  capture  the  temperature-glide  of  evaporation  and  conden-
sation,  and  the  equipment-sizing  models  need  to  capture  the
heat-transfer behaviour of mixtures;

(3) A computer-aided mixture and blend design (CAMbD) formula-
tion is required to design all mixture components. Due to the
molecular  and  combinatorial  complexity,  the  design  space  of
CAMbD formulation is much larger than for the design of pure
working fluids;

(4) A powerful solution algorithm is needed to handle the increased
number of discrete degrees of freedom and constraints and the
nonlinearity of mixture behaviour.

Systematic  solution  methods  have  been  developed,  fulfilling  the
requirements to tackle the integrated design of working-fluid mixtures
and ORC systems.

Papadopoulos et al. [141] linked a CAMbD formulation to a ther-
modynamic ORC model. The thermodynamic-property model is a cubic
EoS combined with GC approaches. In the presented integrated two-
step approach, the authors first applied the chemical feasibility con-
straints only to the first component of the working-fluid mixture but
relaxed the feasibility constraints for the second component. The opti-
mal first component was then identified in the first step using MOO and
fixed in the second step to identify the corresponding optimal second
component. The authors performed a post-design, nonlinear sensitivity
analysis of the employed thermodynamic property and cycle models
on selected mixtures. The analysis considers the simultaneous effects
of  multiple  different  fluid  properties  on  multiple  ORC  performance

indicators.  The  results  indicate  that  some  mixtures  are  more  robust
in property-value changes than others. Furthermore, it appears more
important  to  have  reliable  predictions  for  the  boiling  points  of  the
mixture components compared to their critical properties.

In recent work, Schilling et al. [277] extended the 1-stage CoMT-
CAMD  framework  [274]  for  the  integrated  design  of  working-fluid
mixtures  and  ORC  systems,  so-called  1-stage  continuous-molecular
targeting-computer-aided  mixture  and  blend  design  (1-stage  CoMT-
CAMbD). Following their approach for pure components, the authors
use  the  PC-SAFT  EoS  as  thermodynamic  property  model,  which  is
suitable for accurate prediction of mixture behaviour, even for working-
fluid  mixtures  with  non-ideal  behaviour  (see  Section 4 for  details).
Moreover, PC-SAFT has been proven suitable for designing working-
fluid mixtures based on molecular relaxation [535]. PC-SAFT is used
to calculate the equilibrium and transport properties of working-fluid
mixtures  in  a  thermodynamically  consistent  way.  The  authors  inte-
grated a CAMbD formulation that allows the design of the molecular
structure  of  two  mixture  components  and  the  mixture  composition
as  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  optimisation.  Moreover,  the  CAMbD
formulation incorporates inequality constraints to break the symmetry
of  the  molecular  design  space  and  ensure  that  identical  molecular
structures are not selected for both components. Specifically, the au-
thors  found  that  the  most  effective  approach  is  to  apply  inequality
constraints  on  the  pure  component  parameters  of  PC-SAFT,  which
successfully breaks symmetry in the molecular design space. The model
of  the  ORC  system  captures  the  temperature-glide  of  the  working
fluid  mixture  during  evaporation  and  condensation.  Moreover,  the
ORC  system  model  includes  heat-exchanger  sizing  for  working-fluid
mixtures. Thereby, a thermodynamic and thermo-economic design of
working-fluid mixtures is enabled. The authors applied their integrated
mixture design framework for various ORC heat source and sink speci-
fications demonstrating the strong impact of the ORC specifications on
the optimal mixture. The results show a lower potential of improve-
ment  for  working-fluid  mixtures  designed  using  a  thermo-economic
objective  (i.e.,  the  specific  investment  cost)  than  for  working-fluid
mixtures designed using a thermodynamic objective (i.e., the net power
output).  Rehner  et  al.  [536]  recently  extended  their  CAMPD  frame-
work,  originally  based  on  molecule  superstructures  [452],  to  design
working-fluid mixtures. This framework employs a graph-based molec-
ular  representation  for  both  components,  allowing  the  use  of  the
accurate heterosegmented GC method of PC-SAFT [445], along with
a recent GC method for binary interaction parameters [453], making
it particularly well-suited for designing working-fluid mixtures. Over-
all,  all  discussed  frameworks  for  ORC  mixture  design  highlight  the
potential of a systematic, integrated design of working-fluid mixtures
for ORCs.

5.2.  Solution strategies

Due to the challenging nature of solving MINLP problems, computer-
aided molecular design is not straightforward for the integrated design
of  molecules  and  processes.  Thus,  various  systematic  methods  have
been  developed  and  applied  for  the  integrated  design  of  working
fluids for organic Rankine cycles. Besides the employed ORC models
and thermodynamic-property models, these systematic design methods
differ in the employed solution strategy and algorithm.

The  solution  strategy  and  algorithm  strongly  depend  on  the  em-
ployed  thermodynamic-property  and  thermodynamic  system  model.
For  example,  efficient  gradient-based  optimisation  strategies  require
the calculation of analytical or numerical derivatives. Such derivatives,
in  turn,  need  a  molecular  description  and  thermodynamic-property
model,  allowing  for  a  continuous  molecular  representation.  A  con-
tinuous molecular representation and, thus, a gradient-based optimi-
sation  is  typically  enabled  by  GC  approaches  and  EoS.  In  contrast,
quantum-mechanical calculations rely on a discrete molecular repre-
sentation and require derivative-free optimisation strategies like meta-
heuristics [537]. Thus, a proper solution strategy and algorithm must

40

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

be chosen carefully to find suitable solutions for the integrated design
of working fluids and ORC systems. In this section, we give a short
overview  of  possible  solution  strategies.  For  a  detailed  overview  of
solution strategies, the reader is referred to the comprehensive review
on CAMPD from Papadopoulos et al. [134].

parameters closest to the target are sought. Real molecular structures
can be identified by a database screening [51,517] or CAMD [276,419].
CAMD,  combined  with  a  second-order  Taylor  approximation  of  the
objective and constraints, can be solved as a mixed-integer quadratic
problem (MIQP) using standard deterministic MIQP solvers.

5.2.1.  Generate-and-test

The generate-and-test approach is the most intuitive and straightfor-
ward but computationally less efficient solution strategy for integrated
design problems. Here, all molecular structures fulfilling the structural
and  property  constraints  of  a  CAMD  formulation  are  generated  ini-
tially and subsequently enumerated in process optimisation [56]. This
strategy  is  comparable  to  screening  a  pre-defined  database,  but  the
employed  molecule  database  is  generated  using  CAMD.  A  generate-
and-test strategy for designing working fluids for ORCs has been em-
ployed, e.g., by Su et al. [488]. Since all structurally feasible molecular
structures are assessed in enumerative ORC optimisations, a generate-
and-test approach ensures finding the globally optimal working fluid
of the considered design space. However, generate-and-test approaches
are typically only applied if the molecular design space is small due
to the high computational demand of the process optimisations during
the enumerative search. The size of the molecular design space can be
assessed by the initial generation of all feasible molecular structures,
which  is  typically  much  more  efficient  than  the  subsequent  process
optimisation of each structure.

5.2.2.  Decomposition methods

Decomposition  methods  aim  to  reduce  the  problem  complexity
of  the  integrated  design  by  decomposing  the  problem  into  several
smaller  subproblems.  The  smaller  subproblems  can  be  solved  more
quickly and efficiently. Decomposition methods can be separated into:
(1) molecular-design problems (see Section 5.1.1); and (2) molecular-
targeting problems (see Section 5.1.2). Decomposition-based molecular-
design problems initially reduce the molecular design space by consid-
ering low-resolution performance indicators and constraints based on
physical properties to avoid needing a more detailed thermodynamic
model of the ORC system that typically requires more demanding com-
putations. If the reduced molecular design space is small, enumerative
process  optimisations  can  be  performed,  or  the  reduced  MINLP  can
be solved. The size of the molecular design space can be assessed by
generating all feasible molecular structures. Alternatively, molecular-
clustering techniques can be employed to reduce the molecular design
space further [98].

In contrast, decomposition-based molecular-targeting problems ad-
dress  the  CAMPD  problem  by  identifying  favourable  ORC  system-
related target properties. For this purpose, the discrete molecule pa-
rameters representing a working fluid in the thermodynamic-property
model are typically relaxed, i.e., treated as continuous variables, and
optimised  simultaneously  with  the  ORC  degrees  of  freedom  consid-
ering  an  appropriate  objective  function  [51,276,419,517].  For  this
purpose,  a  thermodynamic-property  model  is  required  allowing  for
a continuous molecular representation, e.g., GC approaches that tar-
get pure-component properties or an EoS. The relaxation of discrete
molecule  parameters  transforms  the  MINLP  of  the  integrated  design
into  an  NLP,  which  can  be  solved  efficiently  using  gradient-based
NLP solvers.  The relaxed MINLP results in a hypothetical molecular
structure of the so-called target with optimal performance within the
considered  molecular  design  space.  The  target  serves  as  the  lower
bound of the optimisation problem. A convex hull and proper bounds
of the molecule parameters are typically required to ensure the tar-
get’s similarity to real molecular structures. In the second step, real
molecules  are  identified  with  similar  performance  as  the  target.  To
ensure  similar  performance,  real  molecules  are  assessed  considering
an approximation of the objective function and constraints, e.g., by a
first- or second-order Taylor approximation around the target. Thereby,
trade-offs can be considered, which are not captured if solely molecule

5.2.3.  Metaheuristic optimisation methods

Metaheuristics are optimisation strategies based on direct heuristic
(biased  random)  searches  to  generate  and  test  iteratively  sampling
points within the design space [538]. Unlike deterministic methods,
metaheuristics typically do not require derivatives, making them suit-
able for thermodynamic-property models that use discrete molecular
representations. Due to their systematically guided search approach,
metaheuristics only need to explore a small fraction of the design space,
which is computationally more efficient than exhaustive generate-and-
test  approaches  that  enumerate  all  options.  However,  finding  glob-
ally optimal solutions is not guaranteed. Furthermore, defining proper
stopping  criteria  can  be  challenging  in  ensuring  a  sufficiently  good
solution.

For instance, Papadopoulos et al. [98], used simulated annealing
(SA) [539] to design working fluids for ORCs. The SA algorithm mimics
the annealing process from metallurgy, where the solution ‘‘tempera-
ture’’ serves as the control parameter of the process. This ‘‘temperature’’
control parameter is gradually reduced, allowing the system to escape
local  optima  but  still  approach  a  global  optimum.  Another  example
is the genetic algorithm (GA) NSGA-II [540] employed by van Kleef
et al. [275], where potential solutions are treated as individuals in a
population. These solutions evolve over iterations through selection,
crossover, and mutation inspired by natural selection.

5.2.4.  Deterministic optimisation methods

Deterministic  optimisation  follows  a  rigorous  mathematical  ap-
proach,  leading  to  a  replicable  solution.  Typically,  deterministic  op-
timisation methods decompose the MINLP into smaller subproblems of
the MINLP [541]. For this purpose, strategies from mathematical pro-
gramming are employed, e.g., linear or quadratic approximations of the
objective and constraints or relaxing or fixing variables or constraints.
Grossmann  and  Kravanja  [541]  give  an  overview  of  deterministic
solution strategies for solving MINLPs. These strategies commonly rely
on calculating gradients, and sometimes also the Hessian, of the model
variables. Thus, an ORC model and thermodynamic-property model are
required,  which  allow  for  the  calculation  of  analytical  or  numerical
derivatives.  Compared  to  metaheuristics,  deterministic  optimisation
methods  typically  converge  faster,  offering  a  more  efficient  path  to
solving optimisation problems. For the integrated design of ORC sys-
tems  and  working  fluids,  deterministic  solution  methods  have  been
successfully  employed,  such  as  those  based  on  outer-approximation
formulations [542] combined with equality relaxation [137,146,273,
274,277,423,424,428,447],  branch-and-bound  algorithms  [137,329],
or branch-and-cut algorithms [518]. These studies have demonstrated
the effectiveness of deterministic solution methods in providing high-
precision results, particularly when accurate gradients are available.
However, a key insight is that while these approaches offer speed and
precision,  they  are  limited  by  their  reliance  on  derivative  informa-
tion and may struggle with highly non-linear or discontinuous design
spaces, potentially leading to only locally optimal solutions [277,424].
Deterministic optimisation algorithms, particularly global optimisa-
tion solvers, can rely on model equations given in their explicit form.
Explicit  model  equations  can  be  typically  implemented  for  GC  ap-
proaches and classical EoS, such as cubic EoS. However, more-advanced
and accurate thermodynamic-property models like SAFT-based EoS are
more demanding and typically evaluated in an external code to ensure
stable computation. The external code typically provides a black-box
model to the solver. If parts of the model are given in external code,
an optimisation algorithm is required that can handle black-box mod-
elling.  However,  black-box  capable  optimisation  algorithms  usually

41

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

only  ensure  a  locally  optimal  solution.  A  multi-start  procedure  can
be  employed  to  account  for  locally  optimal  solutions,  or  a  ranking
of the most-promising candidates can be calculated using integer-cut
constraints.  Despite  the  potential  challenge  with  black-box  models,
the ability of deterministic methods to systematically handle complex
design problems with well-defined mathematical models makes them
highly valuable for CAMPD problems.

5.2.5.  Multi-objective design methods

Optimisation strategies usually enable the consideration of a single
objective function. However, considering multiple objective functions
is often desired for integrated molecular and process design problems
(e.g.,  the  net  power  output  of  an  ORC  system,  and  its  associated
total capital investment). For this purpose, MOO strategies have been
developed. The result of MOO is a Pareto front of optimal solutions.
For CAMPD problems, the Pareto front can consist of several promis-
ing  working  fluids  (cf., Fig.  19).  It  is  recommended  to  choose  non-
aggregated objective functions for MOO, i.e., objective functions that
do not compromise a trade-off, to maximise the information content of
the result [543].

Most commonly, MOO strategies transform the problem into sev-
eral SOO problems. The most intuitive and straightforward approach
for  MOO  is  a  linear  scalarisation  of  the  objective  function, i.e.,  the
weighting sum of all objective functions [544]. The Pareto front can
be generated by repeating the integrated design problem with vary-
ing weighting factors. Other MOO strategies are, e.g., the normalised
normal constraint method [545], the epsilon-constraint method [546]
or  interactive  multi-objective  methods  combining  sandwiching  and
hyperboxing [547], which enable tailoring a Pareto front in the desired
region  and  are  suited  for  non-convex  objectives.  For  example,  the
normalised normal constraint method has been applied in CAMPD for
ORCs by Schilling et al. [274,424].

Due to its efficiency, another popular approach for multi-objective
optimisation  in  CAMPD  problems  for  ORCs  is  the  stochastic  non-
dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) [540]. The evolution-
ary NSGA-II algorithm employs a non-dominated sorting approach that
classifies solutions into different Pareto fronts based on dominance. The
algorithm has been applied to CAMPD for ORC, e.g., by van Kleef et
at. [275].

5.3.  Key observations on CAMPD for ORCs

The  development  of  CAMPD  solution  methods  for  working-fluid
selection for ORCs has gained considerable progress in the past decade.
Significant steps could be achieved in all parts of CAMPD problems:

• Thermodynamic-property  models have  been  integrated  with
increasingly  higher  predictive  power,  starting  from  simple  GC
approaches, progressing with cubic EoS, and finally using SAFT-
based EoS or quantum-mechanical calculations — moreover, ac-
curate  models  for  the  working  fluid’s  transport  properties  and
even non-conventional properties are incorporated, like safety or
environmental properties;

• ORC system and equipment models have been integrated with
increasing complexity, starting from pure-component molecular
properties  that  provide  indirect  links  with  ORC  performance,
progressing with thermodynamic process models, and finally im-
plementing sizing and costing of the equipment, cycle superstruc-
tures, and dynamic component models;

• The molecular design space has been increased, starting from
the  integrated  design  of  pure  working  fluids  towards  the  inte-
grated design of working-fluid mixtures;

• Advanced solution algorithms are developed, starting from prob-
lem decomposition towards a direct solution of integrated design
problem based on deterministic optimisation; and

• Practicability and applicability — while many developed so-
lution algorithms are specific tools enforcing expert knowledge
and experience, the first steps have been taken to achieve a more
user-friendly application for inexperienced users by integrating
CAMPD for ORCs into commercial software.

With  these  developments,  the  CAMPD  solution  methods  achieve
high integration and accuracy. Moreover, the developments enable the
consideration of objective functions and constraints for working-fluid
selection relevant for practical application (e.g., economic objectives or
sizing constraints for the equipment). Despite the increasing complexity
of  the  models  and  the  increasing  computational  cost,  the  required
computational time is still reasonable. The integrated design can be
solved in seconds to minutes considering a thermodynamic ORC model
and GC approaches and/or a cubic EoS [137,518]. Even an integrated
design  using  PC-SAFT  with  equipment  sizing  and  costing  and  cycle
configuration  superstructure  is  still  efficient  and  requires  less  than
an hour to calculate a ranking of five promising working fluids and
corresponding optimal cycle configurations [428]. However, it should
be noted that time is usually not a limiting factor at the early design
stages, for which an integrated design of working fluids and processes
is most relevant. In general, an integrated design is computationally
much more efficient than a decomposed generate-and-test procedure
of the considered design space [274,277,424,518].

In CAMPD for ORCs, open science is essential for ensuring repro-
ducibility  and  validation  of  the  assumptions  and  identified  working
fluids.  By  sharing  open-source  models,  datasets,  and  CAMPD  frame-
works,  researchers  can  replicate  studies,  validate  results,  and  build
on  each  other’s  work.  Open  access  to  thermodynamic  models  and
CAMPD frameworks ensures that advancements in CAMPD for ORCs
are grounded in validated data.

6.  Applications and case studies of ORC systems

The role and development trend of the application of CAMD tech-
niques in ORC system design can be intuitively reflected by an examina-
tion of various case studies across multiple industries. In the more than
a decade of theoretical research on the integration of CAMD methods
into ORC system design, the developed approaches have been applied
to the integrated design of processes and working fluids of ORC systems
with  low-  and  medium-temperature  heat  sources  such  as  internal-
combustion engine with combined heat and power (ICE-CHP) systems,
industrial waste-heat recovery, geothermal, solar thermal and so on.
It has been shown that CAMPD methods are practical, advanced, and
have good application prospects; the specific application scenarios and
corresponding CAMPD methods are reflected in Table 5 . In this section,
we  investigate  selected  CAMPD  case  studies  in  various  application
scenarios through enumeration and induction.

6.1.  Internal-combustion  engine  with  combined  heat  and  power  systems
(ICE-CHP)

When  the  exhaust  gas  of  an  internal-combustion  engine  is  used
as  the  heat  source  of  the  ORC  system,  its  temperature  is  usually
higher than that of geothermal, biomass energy, and most industrial
waste-heat sources. Simultaneously, the influence of the transient char-
acteristics of the exhaust gas on the design of the ORC system should
be specifically considered.

Cignitti et al. [518] applied a CAMPD approach to an ORC device
for energy recovery from the exhaust gas of a 37 MW marine diesel
engine from MAN Diesel & Turbo for the design of suitable working
fluids. The ORC unit had a regenerator and was designed to take into
account the 75% load point of the diesel engine, where the exhaust
gas inlet temperature was 509 K. The GC prediction method was used
to  describe  the  physical  properties  of  molecules  and  a  simultaneous
design method was proposed: an MINLP problem, to be solved using
the LINGO Global solver on the GAMS platform. The integrated method

employed in this work is summarised in the workflow shown in Fig. 20.
Considering the three cases of acyclic molecules, alicyclic molecules,
and aromatic molecules, respectively, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluorohexane,
1,1,2,2,3,3,4-heptafluoro-4-(propan-2-yl)cyclobutane and 1,2-difluoro-
6-methylcyclohexa-1,3-diene  were  judged  the  three  best  molecules,
with  the  net  power  outputs  of  1.21  MW,  1.20  MW,  and  1.05  MW.

An  analysis  of  all  possible  solutions  using  a  decomposition  method
justified  the  results  of  the  simultaneous  design  method  while  show-
ing  that  the  ORC  performance  was  significantly  correlated  with  the
condenser and heat-exchanger UA values. Compared to conventional
fluids  used  in  similar  ORC  applications,  such  as  MM,  Toluene,  i-
Pentane,  n-Pentane,  Cyclopentane  [551],  the  globally  optimal  fluid

(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluorohexane) designed in the case study had the
highest net power output and the lowest degree of superheat. In terms
of pressure ratio, it was only second to hexamethyldisiloxane, as shown
in Fig. 20. High net output power indicates good cycle performance,
and low superheat means improved heat utilisation and reduced heat
exchanger area requirements. High pressure ratios are a disadvantage,
resulting in higher cost and lower performance of the turbine.

Frutiger et al. [548] conducted an uncertainty analysis of the prop-
erties of 15 candidate working fluids obtained using the CAMD method
in the ORC of marine diesel exhaust-heat recovery by Cignitti et al. In
the working-fluid design, the power output values of the CAMD solution
of every working fluid were seen to be close, while the uncertainty
analysis gave a significantly different ranking, providing an additional
standard for the fluid class.

Schwobel  et  al.  [148]  designed  working  fluids  for  two  thermo-
dynamic  ORCs  for  passenger  cars  and  heavy-duty  trucks.  The  first
configuration is suitable for passenger cars without exhaust-gas recir-
culation.  However,  for  the  waste-heat  recovery  of  heavy  trucks,  the
exhaust  energy  from  post-processing  and  the  energy  from  exhaust-
gas  recirculation  was  considered  according  to  the  configuration  of
mass flow separation after the pump. To find the best fluids, a high-
throughput screening (HTS) was performed, which covered almost all
known chemical spaces with more than 72 million entries according to
the structures provided in the PubChem database. A set of 3174 po-
tential working fluids was considered for thermodynamic performance
ranking after applying quantum-chemical calculation-based structural
and thermodynamic filtering criteria to more than two million struc-
tures.  Computational-chemistry  methods  were  applied  to  predict  all
physicochemical properties of interest via COSMOtherm software (e.g.,
vapour pressure, critical point) and thermodynamic-process simulations
were performed (e.g., net power output) via the fast simulation tool De-
tailSimORC. The state equation, combining the COSMO-RS theory with
the generalised Patel–Teja [371] theory, extended the applicability of
thermodynamic calculations to critical points. This quantum-chemistry-
based COSMO-RS method is neither dependent on specific group con-
tributions nor restricted to specific classes of compounds, enabling the
analysis  of  millions  of  compounds  in  the  complete  known  chemical
space in a fully predictive manner of mass screening. A scheme of the
calculation workflow is presented in Fig. 21. It is interesting to note
that only 12 compounds in the top 100 resulting from this screening
(ranked  by  thermodynamic  properties)  were  previously  classified  as
ORC working fluids.

Schilling et al. [427] used CAMD technology to design the working
fluid for an ORC purposed to recover energy from the exhaust gas of
heavy-duty vehicles. The authors proposed the 1-stage CoMT-CAM2PD
algorithm, combining the 1-stage CoMT-CAMD with aggregation tech-
niques, allowing the transient nature of the heat source to be integrated

in  the  design.  Aggregation  technology  allows  the  representation  of
multiple  operation  points,  caused  by  transient  heat  sources,  using  a
few characteristic operating points. Subsequent evaluation of identified
working fluids ensured safety and environmental friendliness. The al-
gorithm was applied to the design of an ORC on a heavy-duty vehicle
considering  the  newly  developed  VECTO  Long  Haul  Cycle  (LHC)  as
input; only six aggregated operating points were necessary to represent
the transient exhaust gas. The optimal working fluid was identified as
ethyl formate, which increased the net power output by 30% compared
with the commonly used working fluid, ethanol.

The  working  conditions  of  the  engine  are  more  variable,  espe-
cially  for  automotive  engines.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  conduct
molecular-design research considering dynamic performance for ORCs
of  engine  waste-heat  recovery.  Tillmanns  et  al.  [276]  proposed  an
integrated  approach  for  optimising  the  ORC  processes  and  working
fluid that considers dynamics. The method is based on the CoMT-CAMD
approach.  The  result  is  an  OCP  yielding  the  optimal  working  fluid
and corresponding optimal system control given the dynamic inputs.
Successful application of the approach was demonstrated; in this case,
isobutane was identified as the best stable working fluid for dynamic
applications. In contrast, the integrated design based on steady-state
input (calculated as the average of temperature and mass flow of the
dynamic  heat  source)  failed,  overestimating  the  average  net  power
output of the top five identified working fluids by up to 30%.

6.2.  Industrial waste-heat recovery

Waste heat recovery in plants is an important technology to improve
efficiency and reduce emissions. There are various waste heat sources
in plants, including boiler exhaust gas, reactor waste heat and cooler
waste heat [552]. ORC is more advantageous in low-temperature heat
recovery in plants, which has great potential [553,554]. The variety of
heat sources and application scenarios require the support of the CAMD
method to customise the best working fluid for an ORC.

Schilling et al. [274,422] considered a subcritical, non-regenerated
ORC for waste-heat recovery, where the waste-heat source was waste
water at 150 °C and the cooling source was cooled water at 15 °C. The
authors utilised a consistent thermodynamic model for an integrated
thermo-economic design approach for ORC processes, equipment, and
working  fluids.  This  method  is  based  on  the  1-stage  CoMT-CAMD
approach, in which the properties of the working fluid are modelled
by the physically-based PC-SAFT EoS. A schematic illustration of the
presented 1-stage CoMT–CAMD approach is shown in Fig. 22.

In this case study, only short-chain alkanes and olefins were iden-
tified. The ideal optimal working fluid was obtained under the relaxed
NLP problem; the specific investment cost SIC = 3058 USD/kW, and
the net power output Pnet = 434 kW. The best practical working fluid

was identified as propylene, SIC = 3318 USD/kW, Pnet = 422 kW. It
was found that the final optimisation results were quite different from
the thermodynamic optimisation results using the net power output as
an objective function (here propane was ranked top; Pnet = 589 kW,
SIC = 6097 USD/kW). Multi-objective optimisation was used to more
closely  visualise  the  thermal-economic  trade-off  between  net  power
output and total capital investment; the results displayed in Fig. 19(b)
were  obtained  using  multi-objective  optimisation.  Through  this  case
study the authors also showed that the predicted specific purchased-
equipment cost and the cost-sharing of purchased-equipment cost show
good accordance with real ORC applications.

Using the above modelling method, ORC systems have been studied
considering the net present value (NPV) as the design goal. For a case in
which the waste-heat source was wastewater at 150 °C, and the cooling
condition was cooling water at 15 °C Schilling et al. [421] obtained
the ideal optimal working fluid under the relaxed NLP problem, with
an NPV of e2.1 million. Next, the five best working fluids were de-
termined, with the best actual working fluid being propylene with an
NPV of e1.8 million and Pnet = 489 kW. It was also found that the
final optimisation results were quite different from the thermodynamic
optimisation results wherein the net power output was the objective
function (propane, NPV = e0.55 × 106, Pnet = 589 kW).

Later, Schilling et al. [428] combined molecular design and super
structure-based flowsheet design and optimised these simultaneously.
This method was applied to the case of an ORC for waste-heat recovery.
In  the  system  design,  regeneration,  turbine  bleeding,  and  reheating
were considered as the expansion options of the basic cycle; NPV, SIC,
and Pnet were considered as the objective function. At the same time,
the process settings and working fluid were optimised, leading to the

best combination of these. The accuracy and the great improvement of
the calculation efficiency of the method were verified.

Based on the above-mentioned 1-stage CoMT-CAMD method, con-
sidering  again  an  ORC  system  for  which  the  waste-heat  source  was
waste water at 150 °C and the cooling by water at 15 °C, Schilling
et  al.  [277]  extended  the  integrated  design  method  of  circulation
and working fluid to mixed working-fluid design and proposed the 1-
stage CoMT-CAMbD method. The authors considered thermodynamic
and  thermo-economic  objectives.  The  most-promising  mixtures  were
effectively identified, maximising net power output or minimising SICs.
Comparison with the best pure components showed the potential to use
working-fluid mixtures. In particular, for the presented case study, the
net power output could be increased by 7%. In contrast, for thermo-
economic goals, the benefits of mixtures were generally lower com-
pared to pure components. However, if the optimal pure component
had a higher optimal superheat, the mixture could reduce certain in-
vestment costs. In addition, the effects of mixture composition, cooling
medium, and heat source temperature were also analysed.

Bowskill et al. [450] studied an ORC system for typical industrial
waste heat with a heat source temperature of 210 °C, with a cycle min-
imum and maximum temperature set to 20 °C and 200 °C, respectively.
An algorithm using an outer-approximation (OA) and an augmented
penalty scheme was proposed to calculate the chemical properties of
the  ORC  working  fluid  using  SAFT-γ Mie  [79]  and  the  GC  method,
and  to  enhance  the  performance  of  the  algorithm,  a  feasibility  test
was embedded in the algorithm to eliminate the infeasible parts of the
search space. The original OA framework and the version reinforced
with feasibility tests proposed in this work are shown in Fig. 18. The
algorithm yielded the top ten fluids, with n-butane ranking first. Using
this model, Bowskill et al. [450] performed calculations for the ORC

application of a 120 °C geothermal heat source and a solar heat source
with constant heat flow ̇Q = 1 MW, and obtained the optimal molecules
propane and pent-1,4-diene, respectively, for each case study. Feasibil-
ity tests for the case studies revealed that low-molecular-weight alkanes
(e.g., propane), olefins (e.g., pent-1,4-diene), and molecules containing
ether groups (e.g., methyl ethyl ether) are ideal ORC working fluids.

6.3.  Geothermal and biomass

In the geothermal field, the design of working fluids for ORC has
been realised for the first time through the CAMD approach. In 2010,
Papadopoulos et al. [98,334] proposed the use of the CAMD approach
to identify optimal working-fluid candidates for ORCs and conducted
a case study on a representative low-enthalpy geothermal field with
diverse  temperature  and  flow  characteristics.  Multiple  performance
indicators were considered as design objectives in the study; particular
attention  was  paid  to  safety  and  environmental  characteristics  such
as  flammability,  toxicity,  ODP  and  GWP.  A  performance  ranking  of
molecules was obtained, including traditional and new working fluids.
The  most  economically  efficient  molecule  was  found  to  be  methyl-
formate  (R611),  which  was  also  favourably  evaluated  based  on  the
other properties.

Extending the heat source range to 70–90 ◦C, Papadopoulos et al.
[335] determined various performance characteristics of optimal work-
ing fluids under the variable-heat-source condition. For the first time,
these authors addressed the design of binary working-fluid mixtures for
CAMD-based ORC systems. This CAMD method exploits the beneficial
properties  of  MOO  technology  by  combining  the  proposed  method
with a nonlinear sensitivity-analysis method to quantify and evaluate
the impact of inherent model uncertainty when selecting the highest-
performing option among the best candidate mixtures obtained at the
CAMD stage.

Papadopoulos et al. [141,336] illustrated the proposed approach by
considering a case study of ORC power generation based on a 95 °C
geothermal source at 9 kg/s flow rate, where the involved groups in-
cluded −CH3, >CH2, >CH−, >C<, FCH2O−, −CF3, >CF2, >CF−, with up
to 16 groups allowed in each molecule. In this case, a series of mixtures
were found, and their thermal efficiency and exergetic efficiency were
higher than those of isopentane–isobutane mixtures proposed in the
published  literature.  The  sensitivity  to  the  boiling  point  and  critical
properties of these mixtures was also analysed, indicating that for most
mixtures accurate knowledge of the boiling point temperature is more
important than of their critical properties. Details have been provided
in Section 3.5.

Lampe  et  al.  [51]  proposed  an  overall  ORC  design  framework
that enables simultaneous optimisation of processes and working fluid
based  on  system  performance.  The  simultaneous  optimisation  was
achieved by exploiting the molecular nature of the PC-SAFT EoS in the
CoMT-CAMD approach. To predict thermal properties, a quantitative
structure–property relationship (QSPR) for the heat capacity of ideal
gases was proposed that relies on pure-component parameters of PC-
SAFT.  The  two-step  approach  for  the  design  of  ORCs  is  shown  in
Fig. 17. This approach was applied in the optimisation of a geothermal
ORC. Taking the net power output as the optimisation objective, the
circulating parameters and circulating working fluid parameters were
obtained.  According  to  this,  the  ten  most-promising  working  fluids
were found from the database containing 200 substances, among which
R227ea  was  judged  the  best  practical  candidate  fluid,  and  it  was
observed that the top six working fluids from the real ranking list (used
to assess the method) were all included in the ten working fluids found
using this method.

Schilling et al. [420] applied the single-stage method of integrated
design of ORC processes and working fluid to the case study of inte-
grated design of a geothermal ORC. In this case, taking the net power

output as the objective function and considering 16 groups, the 1-stage
method identified all the top ten working fluids in the database, and
the computational effort was reduced by 94.1% compared to a single
optimisation process for all molecular structures in the database.

Tillmanns  et  al.  [425]  integrated  CoMT-CAMD  into  the  object-
oriented modelling language Modelica.  Modelica’s existing model li-
brary can be used to model the ORC system. The PC-SAFT state equa-
tion implemented using external functions provided the property pre-
diction of the working fluid. The design method was applied to the
integrated design of the ORC processes and working fluid of a geother-
mal power station, and the top five working fluids were successfully
identified; these mainly consisted of short-chain alkanes and olefins, as
shown in Table 6. The computational complexity of the optimisation
process  is  high  in  this  work,  and  if  an  uncertainty  analysis  can  be
carried out, it will make the results more informative.

Groniewsky  et  al.  [549]  used  the  Cycle-Tempo  thermodynamic-
modelling software to generate different ORC configurations, calling
the FluidProp thermodynamic library and performing calculations with
the PC-SAFT EoS, and implemented the CoMT-CAMD method using the
optimisation process under MATLAB. Two different geothermal ORC
configurations with heat-source temperatures between 80 and 180 °C
were investigated using this method: a simple cycle, and a regenerative
cycle.  The  initial  working-fluid  search  space  was  established  on  the
basis  of  PC-SAFT  parameters  of  60  real  substances  in  the  case.  The
results of CoMT-CAMD were checked against literature values obtained
from  conventional  optimisation  methods,  and  a  more  efficient  loop
configuration was determined for all 11 temperature terminations.

6.4.  Solar thermal

The 1-stage CoMT-CAMD method for the integrated design of the
ORC processes and working fluid proposed by Schilling et al. [423,424]
was also applied to the ORC power generation of solar heat sources.
The ORC structure included a reheater and a fixed solar thermal input
of Q =  463 kW. Here, nine of the top ten working fluids in limited
design space were identified by the 1-stage CoMT-CAMD method with
integer cutting. Due to the local properties of the solver, the method
missed  the  fifth-best  molecular  structure.  Compared  with  the  single
process optimisation of all molecular structures in the database, the
computational  workload  was  reduced  by  94.4%.  The  process  model
was extended by a detailed model of turbine design to demonstrate
the  possibility  of  modelling  process  components  in  a  more  detailed
way.  Compared  to  the  constant  turbine  efficiency,  the  efficiency  of
the turbine in this study is calculated from the cycle process param-
eters and the properties of the fluid, providing a more accurate and
realistic model. Of course, the calculations are more complex, but the
1-stage CoMT-CAMD methodology presented in this study allows for
the simultaneous design of fluid properties and components.

On this basis, Lampe et al. [273] added the turbine meanline design
procedure. A new design and optimisation method was proposed, which
combines working-fluid selection, thermal cycle design, and prelimi-
nary  turbine  design.  In  the  same  case,  the  top  ten  organic  working

47

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

fluids were obtained, mainly cyclopentane and cyclohexane derivatives,
with alkyl side chains. The working fluid that allowed the maximum
net power output was methylcyclohexane, with net power output Pnet
= 101.3 kW. This study demonstrated that in the case of small-scale
ORC systems, turbine design constraints greatly affect the selection of
the  best  working  fluid  and  the  corresponding  thermodynamic  cycle
parameters.

6.5.  Other technologies

Lampe et al. [55] used CoMT-CAMD to avoid complex MINLP prob-
lems,  and  the  working-fluid  characteristics  were  modelled  using  the
PC-SAFT EoS. Using this method, an ORC driven by a waste-heat source
at 360 °C was taken as an example to consider the linear siloxane family
with  the  prospect  of  high-temperature  application,  and  the  thermal
efficiency was taken as the optimisation goal. Based on the optimisation
results,  the  best  hypothetical  working  fluid  was  obtained.  The  most
suitable real working fluid, octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), was obtained
through a mapping to a list of pure components. Finally, through the
process optimisation of each of the working fluids considered, the result
of the mapping step was verified. This was the first time that process
optimisation was coupled with the selection of the working fluid, and
the process goal was taken as the standard vertebra. Avoiding the use
of targets other than process objectives in pre-selection may exclude
the best fluid from further consideration.

Subsequently, Lampe et al. [20] developed a GC method to predict
the pure-component parameters of PC-SAFT and realised the overall de-
sign of the new working fluid and the best system. The non-regenerative
ORC with a waste-heat source at 320 °C was taken as a case study, and
nine groups were considered to construct the working fluid. The opti-
mal combination of working fluid and process parameters was obtained
from the optimisation results, and the net power output of the resulting
cycle is 19.6 MW. The CAMD step identified the actual working fluid
with similar performance to the optimal fluid through database map-
ping and found the best actual working fluid to be chloroethane, with a
net power output of 17.8 MW, which was only 9% less than that of the
(hypothetical) optimal fluid. This is a good idea for optimisation. First
find a fluid with ideal parameters, then optimise to get a practically
feasible molecular structure based on the ideal parameters.

In the previously mentioned studies of Lampe and co-workers, due
to the method of database mapping, the selection can only be made
from  known  fluids;  the  actual  design  of  a  new  fluid  is  impossible.
Subsequently, Lampe et al. [419] integrated the CAMD method into
the mapping steps of the CoMT-CAMD framework to achieve integrated
process and fluid design. The CAMD method was based on a GC method
for the PC-SAFT parameters (GC PC-SAFT) [445]. By investigating the
case  of  non-regenerative  ORC  fluid  design  with  a  waste-heat  source
at 120 °C, the top ten working fluids were determined and verified
by  comparison  to  an  existing  database,  demonstrating  the  general
applicability of this method in the field of ORC working-fluid design.
White  et  al.  [550]  used  the  principle  of  CAMD  to  couple  the
thermodynamic  model  of  a  subcritical  and  non-regenerative  cycle
with the Peng–Robinson EoS [307] to optimise a subcritical and non-
regenerative  ORC  to  determine  the  relationship  between  the  best
working fluid and cycle operating conditions. They showed that when
the  temperature  of  the  heat  source  is  lower  than  300 °C,  the  rela-
tionship between the working fluid and cycle operating conditions is
determined. They observed and verified a linear relationship between
the heat-source temperature, TH and the optimal critical temperature
for maximum power output (Tc = 0.830 TH + 41.27 °C).

White et al. [447,448] proposed a CAMD-ORC optimisation method
based  on  the  SAFT-γ Mie  GC  EoS,  implementing  the  model  on  the
gPROMS platform. This method was used to study the optimal design
of  hydrocarbon  working  fluid  in  a  simple  ORC  cycle  for  waste-heat
recovery at three different heat-source temperatures (150 °C, 250 °C,
or 350 °C). In this study, the CAMD-ORC MINLP optimisation model

was  used  to  investigate  and  optimise  several  different  families  of
hydrocarbon  working  fluids,  namely n-alkanes,  methyl  alkanes,  1-
alkenes, and 2-alkenes. The results demonstrated that the theoretical
optimal fluid for maximising power output should have the thermody-
namic properties of maximising evaporation pressure and minimising
superheat.  This  reduces  the  latent  heat  of  evaporation  and  makes  a
better heat match between the working fluid and the heat source. As
far  as  the  actual  working  fluid  is  concerned,  simple  molecules  such
as  propane  and  propylene  were  found  to  be  especially  suitable  for
low-temperature  (150 °C)  heat  sources,  and  molecules  with  double
bonds  more  suitable  for  medium-and  high-grade  heat  sources  with
temperatures between 250 °C and 350 °C. Specifically, n-propane, 2-
pentene, and 2-hexene were identified as the best working fluids at
three heat-source temperatures, with optimal power output of 35.2 kW,
136.7 kW, and 219.0 kW, as shown in Fig. 23, and thermal efficiency
of 9.7%, 16.9%, and 17.8%, respectively.

CAMPD  methods  for  the  integrated  design  of  ORC  systems  and
working  fluids  have  rapidly  evolved  in  the  last  decade.  However,
three main areas of further development of the methodology can be
identified.  These  concern:  (i)  the  prediction  of  the  thermophysical
properties of working fluids, (ii) the modelling of the system equipment
characteristics both in on- and off-design conditions, as well as during
transients, and (iii) the numerical algorithms and the extension of the
methods to new applications.

7.1.  Thermodynamic, transport, and other thermophysical properties

On this basis, the thermal economic analysis is incorporated into
the CAMD-ORC framework, and the SIC of the system is taken as the
optimisation objective.[146] In the same case, the working fluids of
the ORC system with the lowest SIC were isoheptane, 2-pentene, and
2-heptene, with a SIC of £5620, £2760, and £2070 per kW, respectively.
The importance of considering thermal economy within the framework
of CAMD-ORC was demonstrated.

van Kleef et al. [275] further carried out multi-objective optimisa-
tion for the above case, taking into account the total investment cost
and  net  power  output,  showing  the  relationship  between  net  power
output  and  SIC.  These  authors  found  that  the  molecular  size  of  the
optimal  working  fluid  is  related  to  the  heat-source  temperature.  It
was shown that multi-objective optimisation allows designers to choose
work fluids that meet the requirements in a more flexible way.

In these case studies, it was found that different application sce-
narios lead to different optimal working fluids. From low-temperature
wastewater  to  high-temperature  heat  sources  in  nuclear  energy,  no
single  fluid  can  be  adapted  to  all  working  conditions,  which  is  one
of the driving forces behind the CAMD-ORC research. CAMD-ORC can
customise the working fluids for various scenarios to guide the design
of experiments as well as the development of related products. Con-
sidering the black-box nature of CAMD, it is necessary for researchers
to  provide  as  much  analysis  as  possible  on  the  cycle  performance
enhancement mechanism when designing working fluids to enhance the
credibility and theoretical nature of the design. Providing uncertainty
analysis can make the design results more informative. Based on the
results  and  analysis  of  the  CAMD-ORC,  more  focused  experimental
testing of application scenarios can be conducted to finalise the design
of the ORC, including the structure and the working fluid.

One  of  the  main  limitations  of  current  CAMPD  methods  is  that
the working-fluid design space covers principally molecules containing
carbon,  hydrogen,  and  oxygen.  A  few  studies  additionally  consider
halogenated functional groups  [98,141,518,519], given the advanta-
geous thermodynamic properties of halogenated fluids for ORC appli-
cations. The main challenge with this class of fluids is that GC-based
thermodynamic-property models tend to be less accurate due to their
limitations in predicting the molecular dipole moment, especially in the
case of multiple dipolar groups in the molecule. A potential solution
to these limitations is represented by the vector GC method recently
proposed by Hemprich et al. [555]. However, the modelling of halo-
genated substances may remain an academic problem given that these
compounds are toxic or fall into the group of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
substances  (PFAs)  whose  industrial  use  may  be  banned  in  the  near
future due to the health and environmental concerns they pose.

A fluid class which has not been considered in CAMPD for ORC
systems  so  far  is  that  of  siloxanes,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  these
compounds  are  frequently  adopted  in  ORC  gensets,  especially  for
relatively  high-temperature  applications.  It  follows  that  the  CAMPD
solution methods still need the development of a comprehensive set
of functional groups and a corresponding accurate property-prediction
model for all molecular families relevant to ORC systems. This need
is even more critical in the case of ORC systems operating with fluid
mixtures, as current methods for the prediction of binary-interaction
parameters lack sufficient accuracy or are applicable only to a restricted
class of mixtures. On the contrary, the prediction of transport properties
is performed in the more recent CAMPD implementations with high
reliability,  thanks  to  the  development  of  the  entropy  scaling-based
methods discussed in Section 4.

Besides thermodynamic properties, there are further properties that
are critical for a proper assessment of the suitability of a candidate

48

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

working fluid for a given ORC application, e.g., its flammability, toxic-
ity, environmental impact, and thermal stability. These characteristics
are,  generally,  assessed a  posteriori for  the  best  candidates  identi-
fied by the CAMPD method, though there are research works where
some of such properties were concurrently assessed via an automated
procedure  while  ranking  the  optimal  working  fluids,  see, e.g.,  [98].
In principle, the ideal working fluid should be non-flammable, non-
toxic,  environmentally  friendly,  and  thermally  stable  at  temperature
levels close to those of the heat sources. Given the expected evolution
in  environmental  regulations,  working  fluids  that  exhibit  high  GWP
will arguably not be feasible in the near future. Thus, the inclusion
of  an  upper  constraint  for  this  characteristic  in  the  CAMD  problem
formulation would be useful to prevent the optimiser from identifying
molecules that are not viable. Regarding flammability and toxicity, one
can, instead, argue that working fluids that are not fully satisfactory
with respect to these properties can still be attractive [556].

For instance, a flammable working fluid enabling high conversion
performance can still be the optimal choice. Appropriate measures to
guarantee system safety are, after all, consolidated practice in industry,
as also proven by the extensive use in ORC applications of fluids such
as toluene, cyclopentane, and other hydrocarbons. The additional in-
vestment costs that the adoption of a flammable or toxic working fluid
entails might be, indeed, compensated by the higher energy production
of the plant or by the smaller size of the equipment. Such extra costs
are, however, extremely difficult to estimate in a preliminary design
phase  and  then  accounted  for  in  the  CAMD  model.  The  costs  may
also vary significantly based on the plant location. At the same time,
there are applications such as waste-heat recovery from an industrial
process, where the use of flammable or toxic working fluid may conflict
with the environmental and safety regulation to which the industrial
plant is subject. For these applications, the identification of the optimal
working fluid cannot be performed without a qualitative estimation of
the hazard profile of the molecules.

Predictive  models  for  flammability,  toxicity,  and  environmental
properties  of  organic  chemicals  have  been  developed  for  decades,
see, e.g., Refs. [505,557] and show good reliability, at least for given
fluid categories and a subset of these indicators. Such models can be
incorporated into the CAMPD methodology to exclude molecules that
do not meet certain targets, such as null ODP and low GWP values
if their molecular representation matches that of the employed CAMD
formulation. In other words, the additional thermo-physical properties
of interest have to be modelled according to the molecular represen-
tation  of  the  working  fluid y in  the  optimisation  problem  (Problem
(1))  of  the  CAMPD  problem  (see  Section 5.1).  The  accuracy  of  the
predictive model is key to ensuring that no molecule is discarded due to
model uncertainties. Alternatively, more-advanced CAMD formulations
can be developed, e.g., molecule superstructures [452], that provide
a higher degree of structural information than state-of-the-art CAMD
formulations (e.g., group counts of molecular groups). With a higher
degree of structural information in the CAMD model, more-accurate
predictive models for thermo-physical properties can be made available
for CAMPD.

As far as thermal stability is concerned, no predictive models have
been established so far. This is a strong limitation for current CAMD
methods,  as  thermal  stability  data  are  available  mainly  for  those
molecules  that  are  already  of  common  use  in  the  ORC  technology.
The  potential  of  CAMD  methods  in  identifying  new  molecules  for
high-temperature  ORC  systems  is  then  considerably  hindered.  This
is a knowledge gap that would deserve extensive research efforts in
the future, and that is also of interest for other fields of application,
such as heat-transfer fluids, high-temperature heat pumps, as well as
gas-bearing  technology.  Predictive  models  for  fluid  thermal  stability
should not be limited to pure substances, as there is empirical evidence
that  mixtures  may  exhibit  higher  thermal  stability  than  the  single
molecules in the blend at hand. An example is siloxane-based mixtures
used as heat-transfer fluids in solar collectors, which can operate at
temperatures  exceeding 400 ◦C [558],  while  the  thermal  stability  of
pure siloxanes is limited to appreciably lower temperature levels.

7.2.  Preliminary design of system and equipment

State-of-the-art CAMPD frameworks for ORC systems enable, nowa-
days, the integrated optimisation of the thermodynamic cycle config-
uration  and  the  main  system  equipment.  This  represents  a  key  ad-
vancement in ORC system design with respect to conventional practice,
where  the  various  design  phases  are  performed  sequentially  and  it-
eratively repeated. The advantage of the integrated design approach
is the possibility of accounting explicitly in the optimisation for the
interdependency  between  the  thermodynamic  cycle  parameters  and
the cost, performance, as well as design feasibility [273,275,281] of
the various equipment. Due to the trade-off between such quantities,
in  a  sequential  design  workflow,  possible  optimal  solutions  may  be
overlooked, as already recognised by White et al. [447,448]. At the
same time, the consequence of a decision at one design stage can lead
to challenging problems later on. For instance, the choice of the cycle
maximum temperature and expansion ratio in the case of small power
capacity applications may lead to an unfeasible turbine design, as the
resulting rotational speed is too high or the height of the blade pas-
sages is too small for manufacturing. The implementation of a CAMPD
methodology performing the integrated optimisation of the ORC system
and the preliminary design of its main equipment arguably requires ad-
hoc ORC equipment models. On the one hand, the equipment models
have to be as detailed as possible since approximations can affect the
working-fluid selection. On the other hand, the more detailed equip-
ment models and larger ORC systems are considered in the CAMPD
problem, the more design variables the optimisation algorithm has to
deal with, and the higher the computational cost associated with the
evaluation of the objective functions. Further developments in system
and equipment modelling are envisaged in order to fully exploit the
potential of the CAMPD methodology.

The key equipment for an ORC application essentially are the heat
exchangers,  which  may  belong  not  only  to  the  working-fluid  loop
but  also  to  auxiliary  circuits  of  the  plant,  the  expander,  and,  to  a
lower extent, given the limited size and consumed power, the pump.
In the CAMPD studies targeting the simultaneous optimisation of the
thermodynamic cycle and the related system equipment (see Table 4),
the heat exchangers are typically modelled by assuming a counterflow
configuration and discretising the heat-transfer area in several control
volumes. The discretisation serves to capture the variation of the hot
and cold stream thermodynamic properties and the consequent change
in the heat-transfer coefficient and friction factor. These models are
analogous  to  those  used  in  industry  for  the  preliminary  design  of
heat-transfer equipment, and, as such, they exhibit adequate accuracy
given  the  purpose  of  CAMPD  studies.  More-complex  heat-exchanger
topologies than those considered so far can be simulated with a similar
modelling scheme by relying on the epsilon-NTU method or the cell
method described in Ref. [559]. A limitation of the current modelling
approach arguably consists in the fact that the flow configuration and
the surface topology of the heat exchanger are to be chosen a priori.
Consequently,  the  optimisation  has  to  be  repeated  if  the  best  heat-
exchanger  type  is  not  known  for  the  application  of  interest.  As  an
example, think of extended surface heat exchangers where various fin
topologies may be adopted. A solution to this limitation, which anyhow
transcends the sole CAMPD methods, being inherent in heat-exchanger
preliminary design practice, is currently unavailable.

Regarding the expander, this is often of the turbine type in ORC
applications,  apart  from  small  power  capacity  systems.  In  standard
design  practice,  the  preliminary  turbine  design  is  performed  based
on  the  so-called  mean-line  flow  model  of  the  machine  [560].  This
model is formulated with a lumped-parameter approach, accounting
for flow quantities only at the inlet and exit of each blade cascade,
regardless of the detailed shape of the blades. In spite of the simple
modelling approach, a mean-line code commonly features a relatively
high computational cost for system simulations due to the various fluid-
dynamic loss mechanisms that are to be considered and the nonlinearity

49

C.N. Markides et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

of the resulting system of equations. The work of Lampe et al. [273] is,
at present, the sole CAMPD study that included a mean-line code in the
system model to perform preliminary turbine sizing and performance
estimation according to the characteristics of the working fluid. The
code embeds some simplifications with respect to state-of-the-art mean-
line models and allows only for radial-inflow turbine configurations.
Though not demonstrated in their work, the authors assumed that the
accuracy of their simplified mean-line code is adequate for working-
fluid selection. A possible solution to prevent excessive simplifications
that deserve future investigation may be offered by current advance-
ments in reduced-order model techniques. A surrogate model of the
turbine  can  be  calibrated  based  on  the  results  of  a  validated  mean-
line  code  for  various  working  fluids,  in  analogy  with  the  procedure
described in Ref. [561] for the case of a centrifugal compressor. In prin-
ciple, for efficiency prediction, the surrogate model can even be trained
based on CFD results, thus enabling high accuracy with extremely low
computational costs. To ease its integration into a CAMPD framework,
the turbine reduced-order model must feature among the inputs the
same parameters of the adopted EoS or thermodynamic properties rep-
resentative of the working-fluid characteristics that can be calculated
based on the molecular representation of the working fluid y in the
optimisation problem (Problem (1)), such as the molecular complexity
and the isentropic pressure–volume exponent [561]. A similar approach
can also be adopted for the ORC pump. Moreover, the derivation of
validated reduced-order models for the preliminary design of various
turbine configurations, as well as of volumetric machines, may enable
a thorough comparison of the different expander technologies for the
application of interest. Notice that the CAMPD formulation would be
the key enabler of such a comparison, as the traditional working-fluid
selection process would arguably require an unfeasible simulation time
or lead to non-definitive conclusions if the comparison is repeated only
for a limited amount of compounds.

The improvement of the models for preliminary equipment design
can also facilitate the implementation in CAMPD frameworks of more-
accurate costing models for ORC equipment. In this regard, the models
currently in use typically estimate the cost of ORC equipment based
on the value of a single performance indicator. For example, the cost
of  an  expander  is  often  estimated  based  on  its  power  output.  How-
ever,  its  cost  depends  on  the  size  and  design  complexity,  which,  in
turn,  are  related  to  the  characteristics  of  the  working  fluid  and  the
thermodynamic  cycle.  Single  performance  indicators  do  not  capture
these  dependencies  and,  thus,  might  lead  to  inaccurate  cost  estima-
tions [562]. Furthermore, the cost of the working fluid should also be
considered. Having additional charge in the system has a direct increase
in the investment cost but also indirectly due to possibly more stringent
safety or environmental constraints.

Another  research  area  related  to  ORC  system  design  that  is  still
unexplored,  except  for  the  work  of  Schilling  et  al.  [427],  is  multi-
point  design  optimisation.  In  waste-heat-recovery  applications,  espe-
cially aboard vehicles or in solar plants, the operating conditions of
the  ORC  system  vary  over  time.  Consequently,  the  definition  of  a
single design point does not reflect the actual potential of the appli-
cation and may lead to the selection of a suboptimal working fluid,
as demonstrated by Schilling et al. [427]. In analogy with the design
practice of aero-engines, a better strategy is, then, to optimise the ORC
design for several operating conditions that are representative of the
actual  operating  envelope  of  the  system.  A  methodology  to  select  a
proper set of quasi-steady-state operating conditions based on the so-
called  aggregation  techniques  is  described  in  Ref.  [427].  The  main
limitation  of  this  exploratory  work  is  that  no  preliminary  design  of
the equipment is performed, thus making the prediction of the ORC
system performance in the various operating conditions arguably ap-
proximate. Proper evaluation of the objective functions in a multi-point
design optimisation problem requires, instead, an ORC model allowing
not only for equipment sizing but also for off-design simulation. The
implementation of an off-design model in a CAMPD framework will

require an ad-hoc modelling strategy for the expander, as in system
simulation, the off-design characteristics of an expander are commonly
predicted through pre-calculated or even experimentally-based perfor-
mance maps. Data-driven modelling techniques can provide a compu-
tationally efficient means for accurately predicting such performance
maps based on working-fluid characteristics and the expander design
inputs. On the contrary, for heat exchangers, similar models to those
used for preliminary sizing can be adopted.

Finally,  if  the  variation  of  the  ORC  system  operating  conditions
is  too  fast  to  consider  a  set  of  quasi-steady-state  operating  points,
the ORC off-design model is to be replaced by a dynamic model, as
studied in [276]. In this case, the CAMPD formulation includes the set
point of the manipulated variables of the control system. Consequently,
an  equivalent  optimal  control  problem  is  solved  in  addition  to  the
optimisation of the thermodynamic process and related equipment. The
current challenge of the methodology is related to the computational
cost associated with dynamic simulation. Notably, the simulation time
must be reduced such that the design space considered in the optimi-
sation or the level of detail of the models for preliminary sizing of the
system equipment can remain similar to those of CAMPD frameworks
for single steady-state design point optimisation. The ideal approach
consists in replacing the dynamic model with an equivalent transfer
function whose coefficients are expressed as a function of the character-
istics of the working fluid and the system equipment. As an alternative,
if the dynamic requirements of the application are stringent and then
the controllability of the system is of concern, a design approach similar
to that devised in Ref. [563] may be preferable for the CAMPD problem
formulation.  In  this  work,  as  the  first  step  of  the  methodology,  the
design of the ORC system is optimised with respect to two objectives
functions:  one  accounts  for  the  thermodynamic  performance  of  the
system, i.e.,  the  net  power  output;  the  second  objective  function  is
instead representative of the dynamic characteristics of the plant. This
quantity is the total volume of the more bulky equipment of the ORC
module, namely, the primary heat exchanger and the recuperator. In
the second step, the dynamic performance of the system is assessed by
simulating, in an automated way, critical transients for each design on
the Pareto front and by verifying whether the dynamic requirements of
the application are met or not. A PI (Proportional-Integral) controller
is tuned for each candidate solution by setting the proportional gain
to  a  value  that  is  proportional  to  the  heat  exchangers  volume,  thus
accounting for the specific characteristics of the selected solution on
the Pareto front while keeping the integral time at a suitable constant
value.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  these  simulations,  a  final  optimal
system  design  of  the  ORC  plant  can  be  selected,  knowing  that  the
equipment design characteristics, in particular the heat exchangers size,
will not hinder the synthesis of the controller.

7.3.  Optimisation algorithms and implementation opportunities

One of the key elements of a CAMPD method is the optimisation
algorithm. Possible options considered in the past are derivative-free
metaheuristic  algorithms  that  include  mechanisms  to  avoid  locally
optimum solutions. However, there is a large range of derivative-free
algorithms  other  than  metaheuristics  [177]  that  are  worth  explor-
ing,  as  they  may  facilitate  the  future  incorporation  of  high-fidelity
process  and  equipment  models  in  CAMPD for  ORC systems.  Indeed,
global  gradient-based  optimisation  algorithms  can  be  exploited  for
CAMPD problems if all equations of the models are given in an explicit
form [518,519]. However, explicit formulations of the mathematical
model are often possible only for simple thermodynamic ORC models
and  thermodynamic-property  models, e.g.,  GC  approaches,  or  cubic
EoS. More-complex system models are thus usually modelled by im-
plicit  functions,  and  local  optimisation  algorithms  have  to  be  used,
with the consequence that locally optimal solutions may be found by

the optimiser. A solution to this limitation may be provided by the re-
cent advancements in global optimisation algorithms for implicit func-
tions  [564,565]  or  using  embedded  machine-learning  models  [566].
The use of these algorithms for CAMPD deserves future investigations.
Regarding the applications, as shown in Section 6, CAMPD methods
have already been applied to almost all kinds of processes and energy
sources  of  economic  relevance  for  ORC  technologies.  Only  novel  or
niche applications have not been explored yet, such as ocean thermal
energy conversion, waste-heat recovery aboard aircraft, or propulsion
of satellites. The study of these applications does not require arguably
additional developments in the CAMPD methods. In principle, only the
system model must be adapted. A topic that requires, instead, further
advancements  is  process  integration.  In  current  CAMPD  studies  on
waste-heat recovery from industrial processes, the characteristics of the
waste-heat source represent an input of the design problem. A more-
efficient solution may be found by redesigning the thermal network
or the process itself from which waste heat is recovered to optimise
the ORC system integration and the overall energy consumption of the
plant.  Most  of  the  studies, e.g.,  Refs.  [567,568],  which  explore  this
design problem, make use of pinch analysis to optimally integrate the
ORC system with the multiple heat sources at different temperature
levels  of  an  industrial  process.  The  most  advanced  methods  dealing
with ORC design and process integration, such as those proposed in
Refs. [195,201,202], do not consider a predefined ORC configuration,
but the same ORC system model, also called ORC superstructure. This
model can be used to optimise the plant layout by means of additional
discrete design parameters that can activate or deactivate some flow
connections in the working-fluid loop(s). However, in these works, the
working fluid of the ORC is selected from a small list of predefined
organic compounds. At present, no CAMPD method has been imple-
mented to tackle ORC design and process integration. Only the work
of  Schilling  et  al.  [428]  considered  an  ORC  superstructure  within  a
CAMPD  framework,  though  the  optimiser  can  choose  only  between
three ORC configurations, while the ORC superstructures discussed in
the literature offer multiple options. Further developments in this area
are envisaged in the upcoming years since the choice of the ORC config-
uration impacts the ranking of optimal working fluids, as demonstrated
by Schilling et al. [428]. Another interesting research area for CAMD
methods is robust design. In the field of energy conversion technology,
this involves designing a thermal machine or prime mover, or even one
of their components, while accounting for uncertainty in the model as
well as in the design specifications. The goal is to minimise the impact
of  the  various  uncertainty  sources  on  the  selection  of  the  optimal
solution. The outcome of a robust CAMD procedure would consist of
a ranking of the optimal working fluids based on the chosen figure of
merit along with its uncertainty, which should be fluid-dependent.

Despite the potential of the method, CAMPD is still marginally used
in ORC design practice. The main reasons thereof are: (1) the risks felt
by manufacturers in adopting novel working fluids, especially if limited
experimental  data  about  their  thermochemical  and  thermophysical
properties are available; and (2) the specific expertise needed to set
up the optimisation problem and the system model in current CAMPD
tools, as well as to analyse the results. To facilitate their deployment in
ORC design practice, researchers should ensure that CAMPD methods
can be easily replicated. This can be achieved by thoroughly document-
ing the methods’ workflow or by making the CAMPD tools open source.
Another solution is to implement the developed methods into software
and tools of common use in the industry. In this way, the users can
be guided in the CAMPD problem implementation through a graphical
user interface and a sequential process, as in the case of software for
process simulation. The first step in this direction is represented by the
work of Schilling et al. [423,428], which shows that integrating CAMPD
methods in commercial process flowsheeting software is possible. Just
recently, an integrated molecule and process design approach has also
been integrated into the in-house flowsheet simulator of BASF SE [520].
However, both implementations are so far not commercially available.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 107 (2025) 101201

Tackling  the  challenges  mentioned  above  will  improve  the  rele-
vance, reliability, and applicability of CAMPD for ORC systems. How-
ever, it should be noted that aiming for increased model complexity
and more-accurate models in CAMPD may not always be worthwhile.
As the main aim of CAMPD is the selection of optimal molecules, the
key requirement for the adopted system and thermodynamic models
is to be accurate enough to properly capture the trends between the
various  molecules  with  respect  to  the  design  objectives.  Thus,  the
integration into CAMPD of more-accurate models and methods is mean-
ingful  only  if  they  lead  to  the  selection  of  different  working  fluids
with respect to their less-accurate counterparts. The comparison of the
solutions obtained with new CAMPD implementations against those of
state-of-the-art methods is thus always crucial for CAMPD research.

Expertise:
Professor Gross’s research focus is on molecular thermody-
namics. Together with his team he proposes methods and
models for predicting physical properties of mixtures, with
emphasis on fluid mixtures. His research covers static bulk
fluid  phases  and  phase  equilibria  using  analytic  models,
such as the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid the-
ory (PC-SAFT), developed together with Professor Sadowski.
Predictive models for dynamic properties, such as shear vis-
cosity, thermal conductivity and diffusion coefficients, were
recently developed based on the entropy scaling principle. A
significant emphasis is also placed on interfacial properties,
where predictive models from classical density functional
theory (DFT) were developed in his group, and applied to
various applications, such as fluid–liquid interfaces, adsorp-
tion phenomena, contact angles, but also the coupling of
DFT with continuum models from fluid mechanics.

With  regard  to  this  review  paper,  he  worked  on
integrated  design  of  fluids  and  processes,  in  long-term
cooperation with Professor Bardow and his group (CoMT-
CAMD). Predictive thermodynamic models, including trans-
port properties, are a prerequisite for conducting meaningful
optimisations of fluids and processes. He thereby considered
both  applications  in  separation  technology  and  in  power
cycles, mainly the organic Rankine cycle (ORC).

waste-heat recovery using ORC or sCO2 power systems.

He  developed  the  CO2-based  working-fluid  matching
theory of efficient waste-heat recovery and system minia-
turisation. Automotive engine needs system miniaturisation,
which requires efficient recovery of waste heat by working-
fluid matching design in the simple cycle mode, but there
is  no  effective  working-fluid  scheme  at  present.  Starting
from the exploration of new working fluids, he discovered
the correlation law between physical property of working

fluid  and  cycle  efficiency,  dynamic  response  and  system
miniaturisation,  and  put  forward  a  new  idea  of  defining
the  physical  property  of  ideal  working  fluid  and  actual
working fluid. The matching rule of physical property and
characteristic  of  CO2-hydrocarbon  mixture  was  explored,
and a new working fluid and its optimisation design method
were put forward to realise the efficient recovery of waste
heat under the miniaturisation system.
