The aim of this paper is to review recent progress in detection and quantification of hydroperoxides, and
to understand their reaction kinetics in combustion environments. Hydroperoxides, characterized by an
–OOH group, are ubiquitous in the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds ( ∼300 K), and
in the liquid and gas phase oxidation of fuel components at elevated temperatures ( ∼40 0–10 0 0 K). They
are responsible for two-stage fuel ignition in internal combustion engines and they play an important
role in the formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. The introduction
outlines the importance of hydroperoxide chemistry in combustion reaction processes. In addition to this
main topic, the role of hydroperoxides in atmospheric and liquid phase oxidation chemistry is also in-
troduced, for a more general perspective. The second part of this paper briefly reviews the mechanistic
insights of hydroperoxide chemistry in combustion systems, including experimental detection of these
reactive species before 2010. Since that time significant progress has been made by advanced diagnostic
techniques like tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry and infrared
cavity ring-down spectroscopy. The third chapter of this work summarizes progress in gas phase oxida-
tion experiments to measure hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides, olefinic hydroperoxides, ketohy-
droperoxides, and more complex hydroperoxides that include as many as five oxygen atoms. The fourth
section details recent advances in understanding the combustion chemistry of hydroperoxides, involv-
ing the formation of carboxylic acids and diones, as well as the development of oxidation models that
include a third O 2 addition reaction mechanism. Finally, challenges are discussed, and perspectives are
offered regarding the future of accurately measuring molecule-specific hydroperoxide concentrations and
understanding their respective reaction kinetics.

1. Introduction

Hydroperoxides are molecules containing an –OOH group. The
O –O  single  bond  in  hydroperoxides  is  substantially  weaker  than
other single bonds of organic compounds. C –C bond dissociation
energies (BDE) in organic compounds are most often between 250

oxidation processes. Organic peroxides are mainly alkyl hydroper-
oxides  that  contain  an  –OOH  function  linked  to  an  alkyl  chain,
alkyldihydroperoxides with two –OOH functions connected to an
alkyl chain, ketohydroperoxides (KHPs) that include an –OOH func-
tion linked to an aldehyde or a ketone, and olefinic hydroperoxides,
i.e.  molecules  including  an  –OOH  function  linked  to  an  alkenyl
chain.

This  review  primarily  addresses  hydroperoxides  important  in
combustion chemistry; however, for a more general background of
the role of hydroperoxides in oxidation reactions, the introduction
provides information about the significance of hydroperoxides in
two other contexts: atmospheric chemistry ( Section 1.1 ) and liquid
phase oxidation ( Section 1.2 ). The term low-temperature oxidation
is used in the field of combustion, while in atmospheric and liquid
phase  chemistry,  auto-oxidation  is  normally  adopted;  both  terms
relate to the chemistry of the peroxy radicals and the formation
of peroxide species [13] . Heavy-weight organic hydroperoxides are
also important in biological systems as they can be formed from
the reactions of radicals and singlet O-atoms with lipids, peptides,
proteins or amino-acids and they have adverse effects on human
health [14–16] . Hydroperoxides in biological systems will not be
detailed in this review.

1.1. Hydroperoxides in atmospheric chemistry

2 O

Peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide (H

2 ) and organic hy-
droperoxides,  are  important  oxidants  in  the  atmosphere  with  a
mixing ratio (i.e., mole fraction) of 0.1–1 ppb [8,17–20] . They par-
ticipate  in  HO x ,  NO x ,  and  O
3  chemistry  [21,22] ;  they  contribute
to acid precipitations and acid mists [23] , and they are important
components in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) [24–28] . The for-
mation and depletion kinetics of peroxides have been the targets
of research for many years [29] . It is understood that the ambi-
ent environment (concentration level of NO x , level of solar radia-
tion, temperature, pressure, and humidity), affects the generation
of hydroperoxides [30–32] . Some studies have shown that the pro-
duction of H
2 is positively correlated to temperature and solar
radiation [33–38] , while high concentrations of NO x inhibit the for-
mation of peroxides.

In the gas phase, the oxidation of volatile organic compounds
(VOC) leads to H
2 and other organic hydroperoxides. Table 1 lists
some peroxide and peroxy acid intermediates commonly observed
in the atmosphere [23] . The peroxide with the highest concentra-
tion in the atmosphere is H
2 , while methyl hydroperoxide and
hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide are among the most important or-
2 production is the
ganic peroxides [23] . One major route for H

2 )

[39] . The reaction of methylperoxy radical and ethylperoxy radical
with hydroperoxy radical (RO  ̇O + HO  ̇O (cid:2) ROOH + O
2 ) could pro-
duce methyl hydroperoxide and ethyl hydroperoxide [40] .

and 440 kJ/mol and the BDEs for C –H bonds are between 350 and
590 kJ/mol.  For  C –O  and  O –H  bonds,  BDEs  are  in  the  range  of
330–480 kJ/mol and 350–480 kJ/mol, respectively [1] . In compari-
son, the BDE of the O –OH bond in hydrogen peroxide (H
2 , the
most  stable  hydroperoxide),  is  211 kJ/mol  [1] .  These  small  BDEs
of hydroperoxides enable bond dissociation and the formation of
two  radical  species,  leading  to  enhanced  reactivity.  As  shown  in
Fig. 1 , this easy bond dissociation has made hydroperoxides – es-
pecially  ketohydroperoxides  – the  center  of  chemistry  governing
low-temperature oxidation and triggering autoignition in internal
combustion engines ( Section 1.2 ).

The  stability  and  oxidative  properties  of  hydrogen  peroxide
make it a valuable product with a wide range of applications such
as tooth whitening, bleaching, or disinfectants [2] . Hydrogen perox-
ide has also been proposed as a green monopropellant for rocket
engines [3] . This versatility is not applicable to organic peroxides
(i.e., carbon-containing hydroperoxides), and – with the exception
of tert -butyl hydroperoxide – few can be purchased. Hydrogen per-
oxide [4] and tert -butyl hydroperoxide [5] are commonly used as
precursors for hydroxyl radicals in chemical kinetics studies using
laser flash photolysis and shock tube experiments, respectively.

Several  methods  have  been  proposed  to  synthesize  small  or-
ganic  hydroperoxides  [6–11] ;  these  are  largely  based  on  reac-
tions of hydrogen peroxide with suitable precursors. For example,
dimethyl sulfate/diethyl sulfate can be used to produce methyl hy-
5 OOH); formalde-
droperoxide (CH
hyde  can  yield  hydroxymethyl  hydroperoxide  (HOCH
2 OOH);  ac-
etaldehyde  can  be  transformed  to  1-hydroxyethyl  hydroperoxide,
and  alkyl  methanesulfonate  can  form  alkyl  hydroperoxides  ( n-
propyl through n- decyl).

Detection, identification, quantification, and thorough investiga-
tion of the kinetics of organic hydroperoxides are very challenging,
mainly due to the lack of commercial availability of these reactive
intermediates,  the  difficulties  in  their  synthesis  and  purification
due  to  their  potential  for  spontaneous  and  exothermic  decom-
position  [11 , 12] ,  and  the  limitations  of  analytical  tools  (e.g.,  gas
chromatography, GC). For these reasons, reports on the kinetics of
hydroperoxides in the literature are scarce.

Nevertheless, as shown here, abundant evidence can be found
in  the  literature  for  the  formation  of  organic  peroxides  during

auto-oxidation process [70,71] ; it also affects the atmospheric SOA
formation and evolution processes.

1.2. Hydroperoxides in the chemistry of fuel oxidation and
combustion

This section introduces hydroperoxide chemistry in gas phase
oxidation.  Historically,  studies  of  liquid  and  gas  phase  oxidation
(especially those directed toward understanding the chemistry of
hydroperoxides), were performed in parallel. Observations in the
liquid  phase  oxidation  of  hydrocarbons  helped  to  reveal  their
chemistry in the gas phase; this section begins with a summary
of liquid phase oxidation from the important literature.

Alkyl hydroperoxides are known to be the primary products and
promoters of liquid phase oxidation of organic reactants [72–76] .
When radical intermediates are generated, they react directly with
the initial organic reactant by H-abstraction. The addition of oxy-
gen to the radical site that follows forms a peroxy radical, which
subsequently reacts by H-abstraction of another organic molecule
to produce a hydroperoxide. The decomposition of this hydroper-
oxide via the weak O –O bond forms two new radicals and pro-
motes the reaction propagation [77] . The hydroperoxides formed
in jet fuels could then attack elastomers which result in leaks, or
inoperation in aircraft fuel systems [78] .

Fuel liquid phase oxidation can also yield a wide range of prod-
ucts,  in  addition  to  hydroperoxides:  isomeric  alkenes,  alcohols,
ketones,  aldehydes,  esters,  carboxylic  acids,  cyclic  ethers  or  lac-
tones [72,75,79] . The formation of these products affects the sta-
bility of fuels, lubricants and/or additives under storage or operat-
ing conditions, and can ultimately lead to the formation of gums
and deposits that degrade engine operating conditions by block-
ing mechanical devices [80] . Furthermore, the oxidation stability of
methyl esters is of the highest concern since it is one of the major
technical issues associated with the use of biodiesel [81] .

The chemistry of hydrocarbon liquid phase oxidation was de-
termined by measuring several key intermediates: In 1979, a team
that  included  Stephan  Korcek  at  Ford  Motor  Company  reported
yields of isomeric monohydroperoxides as high as 10% during n -
hexadecane oxidation in a stirred flow reactor at 453 K [73] . The
hydroperoxides were quantified by GC after a complex procedure
of reduction, purification, and separation [73] . Isomeric hydroper-
oxides were reduced in isomeric alcohols by sodium borohydride.
After reduction, the authors observed the diols that indicated the
presence  of  dihydroperoxides  or  KHPs  [73] .  In  another  study  of
pentaerythrityl tetraheptanoate auto-oxidation [82] , Korcek’s team
mentioned that the auto-oxidation mechanism of hydrocarbons oc-
curs through the formation of KHPs; today this mechanism is con-
sidered  in  kinetic  modeling.  These  authors  specifically  examined
the  importance  of γ -KHPs  where  the  carbonyl  and  hydroperoxy
functions were separated by a –CH
2 – group; such KHPs can be the
precursors for carboxylic acids and methyl ketones, experimentally
discovered to be significant products [73,82] . In 1994, using a sim-
ilar procedure, the same team [83] again studied the n -hexadecane
oxidation  reaction  network  from  393  to  463 K;  the  presence  of
hydroperoxyhexadecanones (KHPs, O = C
31 OOH) or dihydroper-
2 ]  was  revealed  through  the  for-
16 H
oxyhexadecanes  [C
mation  of  hexadecanediols  during  the  reduction  by  triphenyl-
phosphine.

Hydroperoxides are also important during gas phase fuel chem-
istry in internal combustion engines because they trigger the first
stage  (cool  flame)  and  the  second  stage  autoignition  of  gasoline
and diesel fuel components [84–86] . This relationship can be seen
in  Fig.  3 ,  which  shows  the  history  of  simulated  species  during
constant pressure n- heptane autoignition. First stage autoignition,
indicated  by  the  first  small  temperature  (T)  rise,  occurs  when
KHPs  begin  to  be  consumed.  The  second  stage  autoignition  –

(b) cyclohexene. Only the radical pathway from the initial adduct is presented.

In addition to these pathways, some studies suggest that the
ozonolysis of alkenes may directly lead to hydrogen and hydrox-
ymethyl peroxide and methyl hydroperoxide [41–47] , without the
participation of hydroperoxy and alkylperoxy radicals. As shown in
Fig. 2 (a), the O
3 addition to ethylene leads to a primary ozonide,
which subsequently dissociates into a diradical intermediate. The
dissociation of this diradical leads either to a carbonyl oxide (i.e.,
the Criegee intermediate (CI)), or the isomerization of the diradical
produces a KHP, recently detected in ozonolysis experiments [48] .
The  formation  of  the  peroxides  is  promoted  in  humid  envi-
ronments  by  the  reaction  of  the  CI  with  water  vapor  [47,49] ;
see  Fig.  2 (a).  In  this  process,  hydroxymethyl  hydroperoxide  can
be produced [23,50] . Similarly, the bimolecular reaction of the CI
with formic acid could lead to hydroperoxymethyl formate (HPMF,
2 OCHO)  [51–56] .  The  experimental  measurements  reveal
HOOCH
a  very  fast  rate  for  the  reaction  of  the  CI  with  carboxylic  acids
[57,58] .

For larger alkenes ( Fig. 2 (b)), the formed CIs could undergo a
1,4-hydrogen shift to form an α-hydroperoxide alkene (i.e., a vinyl-
hydroperoxide  (VHP)  intermediate  [59] ).  Some  small  VHPs  were
measured via carboxylic acid-catalyzed tautomerization of CIs [60] .
The decomposition of VHP releases an   ̇OH radical and leads to a
vinoxy radical; the latter undergoes further intramolecular isomer-
ization and multiple O
2 addition steps, causing highly oxygenated
molecules (HOM) in the ozonolysis of biogenic emissions, such as
mono-terpenes and their model compounds [25,61–63] .

HOM  intermediates  have  extremely  low  volatility;  they  nor-
mally  contain  multiple  functional  groups  such  as  carbonyl,  hy-
droxyl,  and  hydroperoxy,  and  are  an  important  source  for  SOA
[25] . Although the estimated mass contribution of the compounds
containing hydroperoxy groups in α-pinene SOA varies greatly in
different studies [26] , the peroxides have been shown to be the
major constituents of SOA [27, 64–69] . The decomposition of the
hydroperoxy  group  recycles  the   ̇OH  radicals via  photo-oxidation
and/or bimolecular reactions with other radicals, and enhances the

RH (not shown in Fig. 1 ), yielding alkyl hydroperoxide (ROOH) iso-
mers.  Similarly,  abstractions  of  an  H-atom  from  the  reactant  by
RO  ̇O radicals are the main reactions that produce hydroperoxides
during the liquid phase oxidation [75] . ROOH dissociation is an-
other branching reaction that regenerates   ̇OH radicals, along with
the  formation  of  a  reactive  alkoxy  radical.  When  the  tempera-
ture  is  sufficiently  high  ( >  ∼ 700 K)  to  overcome  the  barrier  for
O –OH bond dissociation, these branching reactions from H
2 and
ROOH consume the stable molecules produced at lower temper-
atures,  and  increase  the  global  reactivity.  However,  the  most  ef-
ficient branching reaction (the origin of high reactivity of alkane
at  temperatures  as  low  as  550 K),  is  a  reaction  that  participates
in  a  second  propagating  cycle  (cycle  2).  This  branching  reaction
occurs  after  a  second  oxygen  addition  to   ̇QOOH  radical,  produc-
ing a hydroperoxyalkyl peroxy (  ̇OOQOOH) radical. The internal iso-
merization of this radical by abstracting the C –H adjacent to the
–OOH  group,  followed  by  a  rapid  OH-elimination,  yields  a  KHP
molecule  and  an   ̇OH  radical.  As  discussed  at  the  beginning  of
this  section,  this  reaction  pathway  is  similar  to  the  channel  to-
ward KHPs in liquid phase oxidation [82,83] . The further decom-
position of KHPs results in another   ̇OH radical and a ketoalkoxyl
radical.

2 O

With  increased  temperature,  cycle  2  becomes  less  important
and   ̇OH radicals are reduced. In contrast, cycle 1 and the forma-
tion of HO  ̇O radicals begins to prevail. First, oxygen addition reac-
tions are reversed and inhibited at higher temperatures. Second, at
higher temperatures the activation energy barriers for   ̇QOOH radi-
cal dissociation to cyclic ethers and other β-scission products (cy-
cle 1), and the concerted elimination of RO  ̇O radical to HO  ̇O radi-
cal, are overcome. This is the origin of a specific behavior of alkane
oxidation observed since 1929 [97] : the counter-intuitive negative
temperature coefficient (NTC).

The  kinetic  scheme  shown  in  Fig.  1  is  the  basis  for  the  re-
cent  models  of  alkane  low-temperature  oxidation.  This  reaction
scheme  has  been  used  since  the  90s,  particularly  by  teams  at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [98] , Milano [99] , Nancy
[100] , Galway [88] and KAUST [101] , in order to develop detailed
kinetic  mechanisms.  These  models  were  progressively  refined  to
improve prediction of ignition delay times (IDTs) in shock tubes
and rapid compression machines, as well as a wide range of pol-
lutants in flow reactors (jet-stirred reactors and tubular reactors)
[102] . Significant progress in these models was made by using the-
oretical calculations ( ab initio methods) to predict thermochemical
data and rate parameters [103] . Beginning in 2010, several stud-
ies updated the rate rules of reactions in the cycles of Fig. 1 from
such  calculations  (Refs.  [104–108] ).  This  improved  the  accuracy
of  the  models,  such  as  those  developed  in  Nancy  [107,108]  for
C
5 +
alkanes.  The  Galway  models  were  derived  from  those  generated
in  the  90s  by  Curran  et  al.  [98]  at  Lawrence  Livermore  Na-
tional Laboratory. Two recent Galway models are specifically men-
tioned here: Bugler et al. for n- pentane [111] and Zhang et al. for
n- heptane [88] .

These  detailed  mechanisms  were  built  using  reaction  classes
and  kinetic  rate  rules,  which  are  well  defined  for  C
3 +  alkanes
[110 , 115–117] ,  and  can  also  be  established  for  alkenes  [118,119] ,
ethers [120] , or other large oxygenated species, such as alcohols
[121]  or  aldehydes  [122] .  For  small  oxygenated  and  unsaturated
compounds that can be produced from alkane oxidation, the def-
inition of reaction classes is more complicated and some specific
reactions  frequently  need  to  be  considered.  These  reactions  are
gathered  in  a  dedicated  reaction  basis,  or  core  mechanism,  and
inserted  as  part  of  any  alkane  oxidation  mechanism.  In  recent
alkane mechanisms from Galway [88,111] , this core mechanism is
the  AramcoMech  2.0  [118] ,  which  notably  includes  reactions  for

Gas phase chemistry of fuel component oxidation at low tem-
peratures (below 900 K) has been studied for many years because
it is the origin of autoignition and the cool flame phenomena [89] .
Readers are referred to Griffiths and Scott [90] , Walker and Morley
[91] , and more recent papers by Battin-Leclerc [92] , Zádor et al.
[93] and Westbrook et al. [94] . Hydroperoxides are at the center of
this chemistry. The main steps, currently accepted to explain this
chemistry for alkane oxidation, appear in Fig. 1 .

The chemistry is initiated by slow reactions of the fuel molecule
with oxygen. Except in this very early stage, the chemistry is well
described as propagation cycles initiated by an H-abstraction of a
hydroxyl radical (  ̇OH) from the fuel molecule, RH in Fig. 1 . How-
ever, under specific conditions, HO  ̇O + fuel and RO  ̇O + fuel can also
be minor importance. The focus on   ̇OH here arises from the dom-
inant role of this radical under most conditions and from the fact
that   ̇OH is the radical that results from chain branching. An alkyl
radical (  ̇R) is formed during this process and the oxygen addition
to   ̇R leads to the RO  ̇O radical. Further isomerization of the RO  ̇O
radical involves the internal transfer of an H-atom to produce a
hydroperoxyalkyl (  ̇QOOH) radical. This first cycle (cycle 1) is closed
via the formation of an oxygenated product (a cyclic ether, an alde-
hyde or a ketone) and the regeneration of an   ̇OH radical from the
 ̇QOOH radical.

The most abundant oxygenated products resulting from cycle 1
are cyclic ethers [95] , which are routinely identified and quantified
by GC [96] . Cyclic ethers could be derivatives of oxiranes, oxetanes,
tetrahydrofurans, and tetrahydropyrans that include an oxygenated
heterocycle with three, four, five and six atoms, respectively.

A reaction competing with the oxygen addition to the   ̇R rad-
ical is a concerted reaction of   ̇R with O
2 ; the conjugated alkene
and an HO  ̇O radical are formed. In the RO  ̇O radical, the reaction
competing  with  its  internal  isomerization  is  the  concerted  HO  ̇O
elimination, also leading to the conjugated alkene. HO  ̇O can yield
hydrogen peroxide (H
2 ) by H-abstraction from the initial reac-
tant RH, or by disproportionation with another HO  ̇O radical. H

dissociation is typically viewed as a chain branching reaction that
regenerates two reactive   ̇OH radicals from two less reactive HO  ̇O
radicals.

Other concurrent channels occurring from the RO  ̇O radical are
disproportionation with HO  ̇O radical and H-abstractions from the

2,  the  predictions  were  satisfactory  for  fuel  and  C
ucts  (around  20%  maximum  deviation),  but  they  deteriorated
above 800 K for heavier products such as cyclic ethers. Neverthe-
less,  the  type  and  selectivity  of  the  different  ethers  were  well
reproduced.

This  paper  focuses  on  recent  progress  toward  the  detection
and  quantification  of  hydroperoxides,  and  understanding  their
chemistry  in  combustion  environments.  The  second  part  of  this
review  summarizes  the  literature  on  hydroperoxide  measure-
ments  and  reaction  mechanism  developments  up  to  2010.  The
third section reviews progress and achievements in the detection
and  quantification  of  hydroperoxides  during  gas  phase  oxidation
since  2010.  In  2009,  the  pilot  paper  [123]  in  a  series  about
hydroperoxide  measurements  in  combustion  experiments  was
published,  marking  the  starting  point  of  the  third  part  of  this
review paper. The fourth section details advances in understanding
hydroperoxide  chemistry,  which  is  flourishing  with  the  recent
detection of carboxylic acids, diones, and more complex hydroper-
oxides with up to five oxygen atoms added to the fuel molecule.
The  fifth  and  final  section  examines  perspectives  and  offers  a
conclusion.

2. Understanding hydroperoxide combustion chemistry:
progress to 2010

This section describes how the dominant role of KHPs in low-
temperature oxidation (occurring before autoignition) of fuel com-
ponents has been increasingly understood, and how the existence
of hydroperoxides was first experimentally confirmed.

2.1. Mechanistic insights into the role of hydroperoxides in
hydrocarbon oxidation

While the principles of branched chain reactions were well es-
tablished by Semenov before 1960 [124,125] , the chemical struc-
ture  of  the  branching  agents  involved  in  hydrocarbon  oxidation
was  discovered  considerably  later.  The  roles  of  alkyl  hydroper-
oxides  and  hydrogen  peroxide  in  the  occurrence  of  cool  flame
and ignition phenomena have been understood since 1961, from
the  work  of  Cartlidge  and  Tipper  [126] .  Their  influence  was
later  confirmed  by  Burgess  and  Laughlin  [127] ,  who  added  2-
heptylhydroperoxide during n- heptane oxidation in a static vessel
and observed a significant reduction of the induction period before
the cool flame.

The  reactions  involved  in  cycle  1  of  Fig.  1  became  well  un-
derstood at the end of the 60s, after the papers of Knox in 1967
[128] and Fish in 1968 [129,130] . In Pollard’s review in 1977 [95] ,
cycle 1 of Fig. 1 , and the second oxygen addition, were well estab-
lished, along with accountability for the formation of a wide range
of cyclic ethers (oxiranes, oxetanes, tetrahydrofurans, tetrahydropy-
rans). However, the formation of KHPs in gas phase oxidation pro-
cesses was not mentioned; instead, the branching agents derived

from the second oxygen addition were considered to be alkyldihy-
droperoxides.

Following the work of Korcek and coworkers on liquid phase
oxidation [82] , a review by Benson in 1981 [131] mentioned the
formation  of  alkyl  hydroperoxides  with  a  carbonyl  function  (i.e.,
KHPs) for C
6  and larger reactants. Such species were later men-
tioned in 1985 by Cox and Cole [132] , who described their updated
SHELL model [133] to simulate the autoignition of hydrocarbon air
mixtures. In 1988, the manually written mechanism of n- butane
oxidation  by  the  groups  of  Westbrook  and  Cernansky  [134]  in-
cluded a branching reaction leading to two   ̇OH radicals. The reac-
tion began with an   ̇OOQOOH radical but did not include the KHPs.
A  more  complete  reaction  mechanism  (which  included  KHPs  as
the branching agents), has been developed since 1992. The repre-
sentive works are alkane low-temperature oxidation by Chevalier
et al. [135] , Ranzi et al. [99] , and Warth et al. [100] . These first at-
tempts significantly clarified the determinant role of KHP in the
modeling of low-temperature oxidation. A paper written in 1998
by Curran et al. [98] , about the modeling of n- heptane oxidation,
included KHPs in reaction class 23: “Isomerization of   ̇OOQOOH and
formation  of  ketohydroperoxide  and   ̇OH ”.  Afterward,  the  reactions
involved in cycle 2 of Fig. 1 became the standard for hydrocarbon
low-temperature oxidation models.

2.2. Hydroperoxide detection in hydrocarbon gas phase oxidation

As  summarized  above,  several  papers  mentioned  the  analysis
of  hydroperoxides  during  gas  phase  oxidation  in  the  60s.  Most
importantly, the work by Cartlidge and Tipper [136] in 1960 de-
scribed the measurement of 5–10% of butyl hydroperoxides dur-
ing the n -butane oxidation between 588 and 618 K. The reaction
was studied in a flow system and the products were analyzed by
paper-chromatographic analysis [137] . In the same work [136] , us-
ing cyclohexane as fuel, these authors found appreciable yields of
the monohydroperoxide; the amounts of hydrogen peroxide were
much  smaller.  Using  n- heptane  as  a  fuel,  dihydroperoxyheptane
and hydrogen peroxide were the main peroxides. Another study in
1967 by Burgess and Laughlin used an iodometric method to fol-
low organic hydroperoxides during n- heptane cool-flame in a static
vessel [127] .

Following  this  pioneering  work,  Sahetchian’s  team  at  CNRS-
Orsay obtained the next important results on hydroperoxide mea-
surements.  From  1988  to  1990,  Sahetchian  et  al.  [138,139]  mea-
sured  hydroperoxides  extracted  from  a  motored  cooperative  fuel
research (CFR) engine fueled with n- heptane. The CFR engine was
first designed in 1928 as a test engine with adjustable compres-
sion ratio (from 4:1 to 10:1) and adjustable ignition timing [140] .
This laboratory engine could be used as a reactor with high pres-
sure and variable volume to study the low-temperature reactivity
(before ignition) of the fuels by properly adjusting the intake tem-
perature, pressure, compression ratio, inlet air temperature, fuel/air
equivalence  ratio,  engine  speed,  etc.  [141–145] .  Low-temperature
oxidation products were sampled from the exhaust line and ana-
lyzed by GC, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy [142–
145] , and recently by mass spectrometry [146] .

In  these  experiments  by  Sahetchian  et  al.  [138,139] ,  a  micro-
probe  was  connected  to  a  cold  finger  maintained  at  77 K.  After
rinsing with methanol, the trapped compounds were analyzed us-
ing two chromatographic methods and the analytes were kept in
the liquid phase: thin layer chromatography and high pressure liq-
uid chromatography (HPLC). In addition to hydrogen peroxide, per-
acetic acid (CH
3 COOOH), and alkyl hydroperoxides, the authors de-
tected  a  compound  bearing  an  –OOH  group  and  a  second  polar
function at compression ratio, just before autoignition, when using
n -heptane. However, when using n- butane as the fuel, and under

reactor [149] .

the same conditions [139] , the absence of this hydroperoxide com-
plex and the absence of the autoignition event, was observed.

In 1991, during a further study of n- heptane oxidation in a mo-
tored CFR engine and in a flow reactor, Sahetchian et al. [147] iden-
tified  the  hydroperoxide  complex  as  a  heptylketohydroperoxide.
Their mass spectrometric analysis of the obtained methanol solu-
tion revealed a peak at m/z = 145, indicating a molecular weight
of 146 and a compound with a formula C
3 . Furthermore, the
KHP structure was confirmed by infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV)
spectroscopy. The IR spectrum showed a strong peak at 1414 cm −1 ,
characteristic  of  the  carbonyl  function  of  heptanone;  and  the
UV absorption at 210 nm was consistent with the hydroperoxide
function [147] .

The same team revealed the presence of KHPs during the mo-
tored CFR engine oxidation of n- pentane and n- octane [148] . The
KHPs appeared at compression ratios just before autoignition, and
the heavier fuel molecule showed earlier in the cycle, where they
were formed. In contrast, KHPs and autoignition were not observed
during propane and n- butane oxidation.

In  2003,  Sahetchian  and  coworkers  [149]  presented  data  ob-
tained  by  electron  ionization  mass  spectrometry  (EI-MS)  of  the
KHP  isomers  formed  during  n- hexane  oxidation.  In  this  work,
the  KHP  was  measured  after  trapping,  rinsing  with  acetoni-
trile,  and  GC–MS  analysis  of  the  obtained  acetonitrile  solution.
Figure  5  shows  the  mass  spectrum  obtained  for  2-hexanone-4-
hydroperoxide. The authors also reported a noticeable amount of
hexadiones,  a  type  of  product  not  commonly  considered  at  that
time.

An additional study of the gas phase oxidation of n- dodecane
in  a  flow  reactor  [150]  by  the  team  of  Sahetchian,  reported  the
formation of polycarbonyl hydroperoxides, including four or more
oxygen atoms, in addition to the formation of KHPs. The formation
of dodecadiones was also mentioned.

After  the  previously  described  work  of  Sahetchian  et  al.
[138,139,147–150] , few other experiments were conducted to mea-
sure KHPs in the gas phase oxidation. While the gas phase oxi-
dation mechanism based on cycle 2 of Fig. 1 has been widely ac-
cepted in detailed kinetic models of hydrocarbons, until 2010, the
key assumption in these models – the formation of KHPs – was
supported only by the work of one team.

In 2005, a paper published in “Science ” [151] brought awareness
of the possibilities for species detection and identification by time-
of-flight  mass  spectrometry  with  photoionization by  synchrotron
radiation. Based on this technique, Battin-Leclerc et al. [123] cou-
pled a JSR with synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spec-
trometry at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL),
University  of  Science  and  Technology  of  China  in  Hefei.  During
the low-temperature oxidation of n -butane, the C
4 -KHPs and the
4  alkyl  hydroperoxides  were  directly  detected.  Compared  to

3.1.1. Ideal reactors for controlled laboratory-scale oxidation
experiments

To  simulate  real  world  environments,  as  found  either  in  in-
ternal combustion engines or in the atmosphere, researchers rou-
tinely take advantage of two types of laboratory-scale reactors –
plug flow and perfectly stirred reactors. Jet-stirred reactors (JSR)
and flow tubes (FT) have been the two main reactor types used
to study hydroperoxide chemistry in complex gas phase reactions
– especially  in  fuel  oxidation  studies  since  2010.  These  reactors
are generally used under isothermal and isobaric conditions with a
gas mixture continuously flowing inside. They are popular because
they can be simulated by zero-dimensional models. The dilution
by inert gas in these reactors is kept large enough to avoid signifi-
cant temperature gradients inside the reactor due to the oxidation
exothermicity [159] .

A FT consists of a cylindrical tube located in an oven in which a
flow of gaseous fuel is injected into a laminar or turbulent flow of
a diluent/oxygen mixture [160] . While pressures as high as 10 MPa
have been used, the typical pressure in FT experiments is 100 kPa,
with typical residence times ranging from 10 ms to 20 s [161,162] .
With a suitable design, FTs can be modeled as plug–flow reactors
[163] ,  but  it  is  advisable  to  consider  the  experimental  tempera-
ture profile when running simulations. FTs that can easily be made
from alumina have already been used at temperatures as high as
1800 K [164] .

Due  to  their  complex  geometry,  JSRs  are  usually  made  from
fused  silica,  which  limits their  maximum  accessible temperature
to ∼1200 K [159] . A JSR consists of a heated sphere in which rapid
mixing  is  achieved  by  four  turbulent  jets  located  near  the  cen-
ter of an injection cross. The injection cross is in the middle of
the sphere, attached to a preheating zone with negligible volume
compared  to  the  sphere  [159] .  Typical  pressures  in  JSR  experi-
ments range from 100 kPa [154] to 1 MPa [165] , but oxidation ex-
periments were also performed at higher pressures (up to 4 MPa
[166] ). Typical residence times range from ∼0.1 to ∼10 s [167–169] ,
according to reactor geometry. Using the design proposed in Ref.
[170] , a JSR can be modeled as a perfectly stirred reactor. During
the JSR oxidation of C
3 + hydrocarbons, the temperature-dependent
mole fraction profiles of reactants usually indicate three reactiv-
ity  zones:  one  below  650 K,  one  between  650  and  800 K,  and
one  above  800 K  [153] .  This  is  clearly  visible  in  Fig.  4  for  n -
pentane oxidation. The first reactivity zone corresponds to the low-
temperature chemistry, which is governed by cycle 2 of Fig. 1 . The
second zone is the NTC zone, in which cycle 1 and HO  ̇O radical
formation  are  dominant.  Reactivity  above  800 K  is  due  to  high-

temperature  chemistry  triggered  by  the  decomposition  of  H
These three reactivity zones result in the temperature dependence
of most products exhibiting two peaks (see CO, aldehydes, propene
and  cyclic  ethers  in  Fig.  4 ):  a  first  peak  occurs  when  the  low-
temperature reactivity is maximum and the decline in the inter-
mediate mole fractions is due to the reversal of the R + O
2 /RO  ̇O
equilibrium; a second peak is produced when the rate of fuel con-
sumption at high temperatures is maximized due to the decompo-
sition of the H
2 . The second decline in the intermediate mole
fractions is due to their lower production, caused by the large fuel
depletion, and combined with their increased consumption due to
the large radical pool.

Analyses  of  the  complex  products  formed  during  low-
temperature  oxidation  studies  in  JSRs  and  FTs  are  usually  per-
formed by GC and FTIR spectroscopy, such as the work by CNRS-
Nancy [159] , CNRS-Orléans [159] , Princeton University [171] , and
KAUST  [172] .  However,  these  two  diagnostic  techniques  are  not
generally suitable for direct analysis of the hydroperoxide products,
instead, JSRs and FTs are coupled with two other types of analyti-
cal methods – time-of-flight mass spectrometry techniques and in-
frared cavity ring-down spectroscopy.

advanced  method  lay  in  direct  measurement  of  the  hydroperox-
ides. This work offered new possibilities for more accurate quan-
tification of individual hydroperoxides [152,153] .

In a subsequent paper [154] , the authors reported a photoion-
ization  efficiency  (PIE)  curve  ( Fig.  6 )  for  m/z = 104,  which  corre-
sponds to possible KHPs produced in n- butane oxidation. The mea-
sured ionization energy of ∼9.3 eV in Fig. 6 is close to the value
derived from theoretical calculations [123] , which were performed
with  the  CBS-QB3  method  [155] ,  using  Gaussian03  [156] .  It  was
later determined that caution is necessary when interpreting the
ionization thresholds of these flexible molecules for identification
purposes, and additional information, such as fragmentation pat-
terns, should also be taken into account [157] .

In 2015, using the same mass spectrometry technique, Eskola
et  al.  [158]  confirmed  this  measurement  at  the  Advanced  Light
Source, a synchrotron user facility at the Lawrence Berkeley Na-
tional  Laboratory,  during  n- butane  oxidation  and  using  pulsed-
photolysis (PIE curve in Fig. 6 ). It can be seen that the two separate
experiments produced similar results, suggesting that the major C
4
KHP isomers may be the same in thermal and photolysis exper-
iments,  and/or  that  the  PIE  curves  are  invariant  of  the  isomeric
structure.

The detection of the KHP in 2010, followed by confirmation in
2015, opened the door to a wide range of hydroperoxide measure-
ments, as shown in the following section.

3. Progress in hydroperoxide detection and quantification since
2010

This section is organized as follows: Section 3.1 describes the
main  experimental  techniques  used  to  measure  the  hydroperox-
ides.  Section  3.2  summarizes  the  corresponding  results  in  an-
alyzing  hydroperoxides,  specifically  addressing  hydrogen  perox-
ide, alkyl hydroperoxides, olefinic hydroperoxides, KHPs, and more
complex hydroperoxides.

3.1. Advances in diagnostics for hydroperoxide analysis

The  detection,  identification  and  quantification  of  hydroper-
oxides  in  oxidation  environments  is  not  an  easy  task,  given
their  reactivity,  molecular  size  and  stability.  To  this  end,  re-
searchers have established a set of idealized reactors for controlled
laboratory-scale  experiments  which  are  briefly  described  next.
The two main types of analytical methods used to analyze these
reactive species, formed in idealized systems, have been time-of-
flight mass spectrometry and laser-based absorption spectroscopy.
While laser-based absorption spectroscopy can be applied to small
hydroperoxides,  the  detection  of  KHPs  has  only  become  feasible
with advanced mass spectrometry techniques [123] .

3.1.2. Advanced mass spectrometry techniques

Mass spectrometry is a universal diagnostic tool based on de-
termining a molecule’s mass-to-charge ( m/z ) ratio after an ioniza-
tion process; it has been applied to detect hydroperoxide species
in several laboratories [152,157,173–175] . It is a highly multiplexed
technique that allows for sensitive detection of all species simulta-
neously without prior knowledge of their chemical identities and
as  such,  it  is  very  useful  for  determining  mixture  compositions
[152,176–178] .  Although  mass  spectrometry  primarily  determines
the mass of a particular molecule, structural information can be
obtained through observations of molecule-specific fragmentation
patterns and appearance energies.

Described  first  are  some  experimental  aspects  that  should
be considered when employing mass spectrometry for detection,
identification, and – in some cases – quantification of hydroper-
oxide species in reactive environments. The steps to convert mass
spectra  into  quantitative  species  concentrations  are  discussed  in
the section that follows.

3.1.2.1. Experimental aspects of mass spectrometry for hydroperoxide
analysis

The  goal  being  to  provide  accurate  quantitative  measure-
ments  of  hydroperoxide  intermediate  concentrations  in  reactive
environments, and given the species’ reactivities, it is challenging
to  quantitatively  transfer  these  reactive  intermediates  into  the
ionization  region  of  the  mass  spectrometer.  One  possibility  is
to  sample  the  gaseous  components  through  molecular–beam
expansion  [179–181] ,  out  of  the  reactive  environments  and  into
the higher vacuum of a mass spectrometer ( Fig. 7 ). This approach
is  typically  implemented  by  sampling,  via  a  small  pin  hole  and
a  pressure  drop  between  the  reactor  and  the  inlet  of  the  mass
spectrometer.

In such a molecular beam – guided towards the ionization re-
gion of the mass spectrometer – all sampled molecules fly with
basically the same velocity, precluding further collisions and reac-
tions among its components, and the highly reactive species, like
hydroperoxides, are preserved. Using this approach, the chemical
composition at the sampling location is nearly identical to that of
the molecular beam in the ionization region of the mass spectrom-
eter, enabling quantitative measurements with this technique. The
accuracy  of  these  measurements depends on  many  different pa-
rameters. In flame sampling experiments, which use a similar ex-
perimental configuration, it was shown that although substantial
cooling of the vibrational temperature was observed, the molecular
beam did not fall clearly in either of the limiting cases (effusive or
supersonic [183] ). Thus, this technique enables accurate measure-
ments, ensuring that the chemical composition at the sampling lo-
cation is identical to the composition of the molecular beam in the
ionization region of the mass spectrometer.

Figure 7 shows the two setups established at Sandia [182] and
Hefei [123] . Although both models use molecular-beam mass spec-
trometry  with  tunable  synchrotron  vacuum-ultraviolet  photoion-
ization  (SVUV-PIMS)  as  a  diagnostic,  the  reactor  design  and  the
sampling  position  are  different.  The  design  of  the  Hefei  JSR  fol-
lows  the  work  of  CNRS-Nancy  [153]  while  Sandia  JSR  relates  to
the work of CNRS-Orléans [166] . The major difference between the
two reactors lies in the preheating section. In the Hefei JSR, the
reactant/O
2 /dilution gas mixture is premixed in the preheating an-
nular tube, whose volume is a few percent of the JSR. In the Sandia
JSR, the reactant/dilution gases are preheated in an inner annular
2 /dilution gases are preheated in an outer annular
tube and the O
tube. The reactant/O
2 /dilution gas mixture is mixed at a position
usually  30 mm  away  from  the  inlet  of  the  reactor.  Another  ma-
jor difference between the two models is the sampling cone and
the sampling position. In the Hefei JSR, the quartz cone is fused
within the JSR and inserted inside the sphere of the reactor. The

connection point is at the side wall of the reactor. For the San-
dia model, the cone is inserted into the outlet of the reactor, but
the two pieces are not fused together. Finally, the position of the
thermocouple that measures the reactor temperature is also differ-
ent. In the Hefei JSR, the thermocouple is located inside the intra-
annular space of the preheating zone, its extremity is on the level
of the injection cross. The thermocouple in the Sandia JSR is fixed
at the tip of the sampling cone. The cooling effect of the sampling
causes the measured temperature to be slightly lower than the re-
action temperature inside the JSR.

At Princeton University, two studies showed hydrogen peroxide
measurements using a tubular reactor coupled with a molecular
beam EI-MS diagnostic [184,185] . The ionization energy used (i.e.,
30 eV) was too high to detect organic hydroperoxides.

In another approach [119,173,186] at CNRS-Nancy, gas mixtures
from a JSR were sampled and transferred through a capillary tube
into the ionization region of the mass spectrometer. While reac-
tions between the sampled gaseous components were not stopped,
reliable quantitative information could still be obtained when the
residence time in the transfer line was maintained at much less
than the mean residence time in the reactors. This approach has
been  combined  with  laser-based  ionization  techniques.  The  JSR
used  at  CNRS-Nancy  with  MS,  GC  and  CRDS  (cavity  ring-down
spectroscopy, Section 3.1.3 ) has the same geometry as that used
in Hefei with SVUV-PIMS. For comparison purposes, both reactors
were often used under the same operating conditions.

For  the  ionization  of  gaseous  species,  several  different  ion-
ization  techniques  are  employed  in  mass  spectrometry.  Most
commonly,  the  gaseous  species  are  ionized  via  removal  of  the
most-weakly  bound  valence  electron  after  interactions  with  en-
ergetic electrons (electron ionization, EI) or photons (photon ion-
ization,  PI).  In  the  PI  technique,  tools  have  become  available
that  are  either  based  on  laser  or  synchrotron-generated  radia-
tion.  The  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  EI  and  PI  tech-
niques in combustion chemistry research have been described in
detail  in  Ref.  [178]  and  are  briefly  summarized  hereafter.  Ion-
ization  of  the  sampled  species  can  be  alternatively  achieved  via
gas  phase  ion  molecule  reactions  at  atmospheric  pressures  (at-
mospheric  pressure  chemical  ionization,  APCI).  APCI  is  a  soft
ionization  technique  in  which  the  species  are  typically  ionized
through a proton transfer onto the targeted molecule. The model
used  at  KAUST,  where  the  JSR  and  the  APCI  source  are  com-
bined  with  an  orbitrap  mass  spectrometer  (OTMS),  is  shown  in
Fig. 8 .

For  the  detection  of  hydroperoxide  species,  the  PI  and  APCI
techniques have proven to be very successful [174] . Compared to
the EI technique (which suffers partly from the large width of the
electron’s  energy  distribution),  APCI  and  PI  have  the  advantage
of avoiding fragmentation under special experimental conditions.
For  the  photoionization  of  hydroperoxide  species,  energies  in
the range from 8 to 10 eV are typically necessary. Photons in this
energy range can be generated using non-linear mixing schemes in
a laser laboratory (at CNRS-Nancy [173] ), or at vacuum-ultraviolet
(VUV)  beamlines  at  synchrotrons  found  at  the  Advanced  Light
Source in Berkeley (USA) [187] , the National Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory  in  Hefei  (China)  [188–190] ,  the  Swiss  Light  Source
at  the  Paul-Scherrer  Institute  (Switzerland)  [191] ,  and  at  SOLEIL
(France) [192] . The wide-range tunability and the high photon flux
of  synchrotron-generated  VUV  photons  are  unmatched  by  laser-
based PI techniques, providing an advantage for sensitive species
detection  and  their  identification,  based  on  so-called  PIE  curves.
The  possibility  to  ionize  near  a  molecule’s  ionization  threshold
can especially minimize complications when interpreting the mass
spectra. However, it should also be pointed out that fragmentation
can be used (as discussed by Moshammer et al. [157] ), for species
identification.

In the four mass spectrometers which were extensively used to
analyse  hydroperoxides  (CNRS-Nancy,  USTC,  Sandia,  and  KAUST),
the separation of the created ions was based on either their re-
spective flight time to the detector (time-of-flight mass spectrom-
etry),  or  on  an  orbitrap.  These  mass  spectrometers  offer  a  wide
range  of  resolving  power  and  are  suitable  for  separating  oxy-
genated from hydrocarbon species. Mass resolutions of m/ (cid:5)m of
∼20 0 0 (CNRS-Nancy), ∼250 0 (USTC), ∼40 0 0 (Sandia), 10 5 (KAUST)

are  typically  achieved.  To  avoid  confusion  about  the  different
mass  resolution  of  the  various  instruments,  the  m/z  ratio  of  the
targeted species is given only as the nominal mass throughout this
manuscript.

In addition to detection of the hydroperoxide species based on
m/z ratio, mass spectrometry also allows for the identification of
the molecular structure of the detected species. First, to analyze
the  fragmentation  pattern  (arguably  difficult  to  identify  in  mass

exists, it also showed its limitations in assigning isomeric struc-
tures for other systems. This technical approach is fine for small
hydroperoxide  species,  including  H
3 OOH,  and  these
small  molecules  can  easily  be  assigned  for  molecular  structures.
However, even with this state-of-the-art diagnostic, the assignment
for larger molecules should also be based on chemical intuition,
not on PIE curves alone. In the future, new analytical mass spec-
trometry tools might become available to overcome these limita-
tions.  These  techniques  are  likely  to  include  photoelectron  pho-
toion coincidence (PEPICO) or Tandem MS, as already successfully
implemented for combustion research [191–196] .

spectra obtained from complex reaction mixtures), the combina-
tion of mass spectrometric detection with synchrotron generated,
tunable VUV radiation for ionization and high-level ab-initio cal-
culations  have  proven  to  be  very  successful.  The  ability  to  ex-
perimentally  determine  ionization  and  fragment  appearance  en-
ergies  via  the  PIE  curves  is  unmatched  by  any  other  ionization
technique.  Because  of  the  substantial  vibrational  cooling  in  the
molecular  beam,  the  internal  energy  of  the  targeted  species  is
small  and  thresholds  for  reactor-sampled  and  room  temperature
PIE curves have been found to be identical in shape, within the
experimental signal-to-noise ratios. Hot-bands are not typically ob-
served and the internal energy of the targeted species does not af-
fect the species’ assignments [154,157] . For example, Moshammer
et  al.  [157]  clearly  identified  hydroperoxymethylformate  (HPMF,
HOOCH
2 OCHO)  as  the  KHP  produced  in  the  low-temperature
oxidation  of  dimethyl  ether  (DME)  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  by
matching the observed ionization and fragment appearance ener-
gies to calculated values ( Fig. 9 ).

As  noted  in Ref.  [157] , it  is  necessary to  emphasize the  con-
formeric  structures  when  assigning  PIE  curves  to  structural  iso-
mers,  adding  complexity  to  the  data  analysis  and  interpretation.
While  the  work  of  Moshammer  et  al.  [157]  clearly  benefited
from  the  fact  that  only  one  possible  isomeric  form  of  the  KHP

Strategies  to  convert  mass  spectra  into  quantitative  species
concentration  profiles  have  been  developed  for  PI  techniques
[176,182,197–199] . For EI mass spectrometry, Guo et al. [175] used
a direct calibration method to quantify H
2  during the FT oxi-
dation of DME. In the case of APCI mass spectrometry, it has not
been  applied  to  quantify  hydroperoxide  species;  therefore,  only
strategies to obtain quantitative information based on the PI tech-
niques are described here. The quantification strategies are based
on the fact that the targeted species mole fraction is correlated to
the observed signal intensity by the following relationship:
x i ( T ) = S i ( T , E ) / [ σi ( E ) × φ( E ) × SW × MD F i × c × FKT ( T ) ]

(1)

2 O

In Eq. (1) , x

i (T) is the mole fraction of species i at a given tem-
i (T, E) is the energy-dependent total ion signal related
perature T, S
to the targeted species, σ
i (E) is the ionization cross-section at a
given  photon  energy,  φ(E)  is  the  photon  flux,  SW  is  the  num-
ber  of  mass  spectral  accumulations  (sweeps),  MDF
i  is  the  mass
discrimination factor, c is a calibration constant, and FKT(T) is a
temperature-dependent sampling function.

Sometimes it is sufficient – and more convenient – to report
the ratio of the target species mole fraction to a known reference
species. Eq. (1) can then be rewritten as:

x i ( T ) / x

ref ( T ) = S i ( T , E ) / S

ref ( T , E ) × σ

ref ( E ) / σi ( E ) × MD F

ref / MD F i
(2)

With this approach, uncertainties associated with the accurate
measurement of the photon flux and the determination of c × FKT
are eliminated. More importantly, such an approach allows quan-
tification  of  the  laser-based  single-photon  ionization  mass  spec-
tra when access to the Ar signal (normally used as the calibration
standard) is not accessible because the photon energy of 10.6 eV is
below the argon ionization energy. For example, Rodriguez et al.
( n- pentane  [173] ,  n- heptane/ n- decane  [186] )  and  Meng  et  al.  (1-
hexene [119] ) used propene as a reference species, with its con-
centration determined from accompanying GC measurements.

When  all  the  parameters  are  known,  Eq.  (1)  can  be  used

to  directly  calculate  the  mole  fraction  x

tors (which correct for a m/z -dependent detection efficiency), are
typically  measured  using  calibrated  gas  mixtures,  covering  the

from the literature, newly measured, and estimated based on simi-
lar structures, or it is calculated using a theoretical framework. The
sampling function FKT and calibration constant c are determined
from the experimental data, taking into account the known inlet
flow conditions and the mass balance.

There  are  a  couple  of  challenges  associated  with  the  quan-
tification  of  the  peroxide  species:  (a)  These  compounds  tend  to
be unstable under ambient conditions and, with the exception of
2  and HO  ̇O [200] , experimentally determined photoionization
H
cross-sections  for  peroxide  species  are  not  available.  (b)  The
fragmentation patterns of the peroxide ions are mostly unknown,
complicating  quantification  procedures,  since  the  total  photoion-
ization  cross-sections  must  be  correlated  to  the  total  ion  count
that corresponds to the sum of the parent and fragment ions.

Theoretical frameworks have been developed to overcome the
challenges in determining photoionization cross-sections of unsta-
ble species. Based on work from Bobeldijk et al. [201] , photoioniza-
tion cross-sections can be estimated using group additivity theory;
however, as discussed below, the additivity rule appears to result
in cross-sections that are usually too large, i.e. the experimentally
determined  peroxide  mole  fractions  are  too  small.  Nevertheless,
this approach has been used (for example in Ref. [173] ), for the
quantification of hydroperoxides in n- pentane oxidation. This re-
sulted in the determination of mole fractions for methyl hydroper-
oxide  (cross-section  ∼4  Mb  at  10.6 eV)  and  ethyl  hydroperoxide
(cross-section ∼5 Mb) that agreed with the modeling predictions
to within a factor of 2.5 [111] . A significant underdetermination of
the experimental mole fraction – a factor ∼125 – was found for
KHPs with cross-section ∼15 Mb.

In an alternative approach, routines to quantum-chemically cal-
culate photoionization cross-sections have been developed [202–
210] .  Moshammer  et  al.  [182]  used  routines  from  Lucchese  and
coworkers for the quantification of methyl hydroperoxide and hy-
droperoxymethylformate (HPMF) in a dimethyl ether (DME) low-
temperature  oxidation  study.  Following  a  large  set  of  test  cases
[182] , it was concluded that this theoretical approach resulted in
cross-sections  that  were  good  to  within  a  factor  of  two.  In  the
DME oxidation study [182] , calculated cross-sections for CH
3 OOH
and HPMF were ∼6 Mb at energies up to 2 eV above the ioniza-
tion energy ( Fig. 10 (a) and (c)). It is noted that discrepancies in
the results from the group additivity rules (Bobeldijk et al. [201] )
can exist. Following the procedures of Bobeldijk et al. [201] , the
group additivity rules resulted in cross-sections at 11.8 eV of 9 Mb
for CH
3 OOH and 40 Mb for the HPMF. The result of the theoreti-
cally derived ionization cross-section is comparable to that of the
group additivity of CH
3 OOH; the group additivity leads to an un-
usually large cross-section for the more complex HPMF molecule
which seems to be outside the expected uncertainty of the theo-
retically derived value. For H
2 a large energy-dependence of the
photoionization cross-section was observed, largely due to the in-
volvement of a low-lying excited electronic state of H
2 (see Sup-
plementary Material of Ref. [182] ).

Until now, these quantum-chemical routines have not been cou-
pled  with  Franck–Condon  overlap  calculations  (a  future  research
topic), considering the large-amplitude motions in these peroxide
species. Therefore, Moshammer et al. [182] normalized the experi-
mentally determined PIE curves to the theoretically predicted value
as shown here in Fig. 10 (a) and (c).

Using  this  approach,  methyl  hydroperoxide  was  quantified,
and, as shown in Fig. 10 (b), the experimentally determined mole

fraction agreed reasonably well with the modeled value, using an
up-to-date chemically detailed kinetic model. The same procedures
were applied by Tao et al. [199] to quantify the methyl hydroperox-
ide and its corresponding methyl hydroperoxyl radical during the
low-temperature oxidation of acetaldehyde.

The situation for quantifying KHPs is more complicated because
fragmentation patterns of the peroxide ions must be considered;
this is because both the additivity rules and quantum-chemically
calculated  cross-sections  typically  result  in  total  photoionization
cross-sections. Therefore, the identification of fragment ions in the
complex  mass  spectra  is  important.  This  can  be  achieved  using
chemical intuition or experimentally observed appearance energies
and comparison with theoretical calculations. For example, for the
quantification of the HPMF in the DME low-temperature oxidation,
it was essential to identify the –H, –CO, –HOO fragmentation chan-
nels which then contributed to the total ion count of HPMF ( Figs. 9
and 10 (c)). The total ion count for the targeted species is then the
sum of the ions observed at the m/z of the parent ion and at the
respective masses of the fragments. Using the same normalization
strategy for methyl hydroperoxide (i.e. normalizing the experimen-
tal PIE curve onto the calculated photoionization cross section), al-
lowed for a quantification of HPMF, resulting in mole fractions that
were in reasonable agreement with up-to-date kinetic model cal-
culations ( Fig. 10 (d)).

3.1.3. Infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopy

Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is a highly sensitive di-
rect absorption technique based on the rate of absorption of the
light  confined  in  an  optical  cavity,  which  consists  of  two  highly
reflective mirrors (CRDS mirrors usually have a selectivity around
0.99997) fixed at each end of a cell. The high sensitivity is obtained
by trapping an absorbed laser beam inside the cell and by the cor-
responding high value of the length of the optical path: e.g., an
80 cm cell can have an actual optical path of around 100 km.

Due to its high sensitivity and relatively low cost, this technique
is  widely  used  in  many  research  areas,  mainly  in  physical,  ana-
lytical and atmospheric chemistries, but also in biology, medicine,
environmental and combustion chemistry [211] . CRDS has become
the technique of choice for detection of species important in the
atmosphere [212–215] – even those present in trace amounts.

This  section  describes  how  CRDS  was  used  to  identify  and
quantify reaction products and how this technique was applied to
study hydrogen peroxide formation during low-temperature oxida-
tion of fuels. The low-temperature oxidation studies that have used
CRDS to date are also listed.

3.1.3.1. Spectroscopic  method  applied  to  low-temperature  oxidation
studies

Cavity  ring-down  spectroscopy  has  been  used  in  the  field
of  combustion  chemistry  since  the  mid-90s  to  probe  various
species  – even  reactive  species  like  hydroxyl  radicals  in  flames
[216–218] .  It  was  also  used  to  measure  the  absolute  volume
fraction  of  soot  particles  in  flames  [219] .  Several  types  of  CRDS
are  used,  they  differ  mainly  by  the  light  source  used.  Standard
pulsed  CRDS  (using  a  pulsed  laser)  are  easiest  to  use;  however,
the continuous wave CRDS ( cw -CRDS), using a constant laser with
lower bandwidth, allows single longitudinal mode excitation and is
frequently utilized. The cw -CRDS has higher sensitivity, repetition
rate and spectral resolution than standard pulsed CRDS [220] .

The sensitivity of CRDS depends mainly on the length of the
optical path in the cell. In optimal conditions, and due to the trap-
ping of the absorbed laser beam inside the cavity, a CRDS tech-
nique can have a sensitivity 10 7  times better than a single path
absorption technique [221] . Application of cw -CRDS to the study
of the low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons and biofuels is

CRDS cell, functioning with an infrared diode laser, and a JSR. To
our knowledge, two experimental set-ups, based on CRDS are cur-
rently being developed to study fuel oxidation. The first was de-
veloped at CNRS-Nancy in collaboration with the University of Lille
[222] . Some years later, another model was built at CNRS-Orléans
[223] . These two experimental set-ups are very similar. The main
difference is the sampling method: a sonic probe is used in Nancy
and a sampling cone is implemented in Orléans. As described here-
after, hydrogen peroxide was successfully detected using both ex-
perimental set-up. Another difference is the wavelength range used
for the measurements: typically 6 638–6 643 cm −1 at CNRS-Nancy,
and 6 623–6 626 cm −1 at CNRS-Orléans. Figure 11 shows the setup
at CNRS-Nancy. The cw -CRDS cell is a glass tube with the two mir-
rors located at each end of a cylindrical cell.

Although it uses a continuous-wave (cw) diode laser, the so-
called cw -CRDS method at Nancy is not really a continuous-wave
technique; the laser light provided by a diode laser (in the 6624–
6647  cm −1  range)  passed  through  an  acousto-optic  modulator
(AOM). The AOM was triggered by an avalanche photodiode that
detects light emitted by the cavity. The first order diffracted beam
was  sent  to  the  cell  and  rapidly  extinguished  when  the  photo-
detector  found  a  strong  signal  from  the  cavity  (when  the  reso-
nance occurred). During this time, the decrease of the signal due
to species absorption was recorded as a function of time. The ring-
down time was extracted from the signal decay by performing a
Levenberg–Marquardt exponential fit.

A fused silica tube sonic probe with a ∼100 μm pin hole at its
tip ( Fig. 11 ) performed the sampling inside the gas phase of the
reactor. The probe created the required pressure drop between the
reactor (operated at slightly above atmospheric pressure), and the
cell which was under partial vacuum (between 1.33 and 6.67 kPa).
The gas expansion in the probe froze the reaction [159] .

3.1.3.2. Identification and quantification of reaction products

Figure  12  displays  the  spectrum  recorded  in  the  6638–
6642  cm −1  range  during  the  oxidation  study  of  dimethyl  ether
[120] .  Additional  spectra  recorded  for  water,  hydrogen  perox-
ide/water solution, and a spectrum of formaldehyde [224] from the
literature, are also presented. This figure illustrates the difficulty in
identifying isolated peaks in combustion mixtures where many ab-
sorbing products are present. Symbols in the panels of Fig.12 cor-
respond to peaks used for the detection of the given species.

When  the  peaks  have  been  selected  for  the  quantification,
frequency-specific  absorption  coefficients  α( ν)  can  be  calculated
from the ring-down time using Eq. (3) :

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

α( υ ) =

R L
c

1
τ ( υ )

− 1

τ0 ( υ )

(3)

where R
L is the ratio of the cavity length (i.e. the distance between
the two cavity mirrors) to the length of the absorption cell, c is the
speed of light, τ ( ν) and τ ο( ν) are the ring-down times measured
with the cell containing species A and with an empty cell, respec-
tively. In the Nancy setup, the R

L ≈ 1.
The concentration of the species A is deduced from α( ν) and
from the value of the absorption cross-section of species A at the
considered wavelength using Eq. (4) :
α( υ ) = [ A ] × σ ( υ ) ,
(4)
where [A] is the concentration of species A and σ ( ν) is the absorp-
tion cross-section of species A.

One major advantage of this technique is that the absorption
cross-section is an absolute value. It depends mostly on the wave-
length  ν and  can  be  measured  independently  from  the  setups.
For example, the cross-section used for the quantification of hy-
drogen peroxide in all the experiments performed at CNRS-Nancy
( Section 3.2.1 ) was taken from the measurements of Parker et al.

[225] .  In  this  work,  hydrogen  peroxide  absorption  cross-sections
were  obtained  by  the  combination  of  spectroscopic  and  kinetic
measurements of   ̇OH and HO  ̇O radicals, produced by the photol-
2  at 248 nm. Time-resolved measurements of   ̇OH and
ysis of H
HO  ̇O  radicals  by  laser-induced  fluorescence  were  used  to  deter-
mine the initial hydrogen peroxide concentrations, the absorption
cross-sections were then derived from the absorption coefficients.
Note  that  peak  broadening  was  observed  when  the  pressure  in
the cell increased. Because the temperature is given (room tem-
perature), the temperature dependence of the cross-section is not
important.

The theoretical detection limit α

min depends on the mirror re-
flectivity  R ,  the  length  of  the  cell  L,  and  the  minimum  relative

variation of the ring down time that can be detected, (

For conditions usually used in combustion studies [222] (e.g.,

a reflectivity of 99.99%, a cavity length of 70 cm, and a  (

min  is close to 1.4 × 10 −8  cm −1 . This corresponds to
a  concentration  of  about  50 ppm  when  detecting  formaldehyde
using  the  peak  at  6639.33  cm −1 .  However,  this  detection  limit
can  significantly  increase  under  less  than  ideal  conditions.  For
example,  when  the  spectra  are  crowded  with  very  close  peaks,
and  when  the  baseline  around  the  quantified  peak  is  not  well

3.1.3.3. Low-temperature oxidation studies performed using cw-CRDS
Table 2 summarizes published studies on fuel oxidation using a
JSR and cw-CRDS. Several species (CH
4 ,
HONO,  and  HO  ̇O  radical)  can  be  measured  by  CRDS,  with  care-
ful  selection  of  the  wavelengths.  The  first  study  using  CRDS  for
low-temperature oxidation focused on the detection of intermedi-
ates during the oxidation of methane [222] . The detected species
were formaldehyde, methane, and water. Hydrogen peroxide was
not  detected  in  this  study,  because  its  concentrations  were  be-
low  the  estimated  detection  limit  of  130 ppm.  Hydrogen  perox-
ide  was  detected  by  CRDS  in  the  following  studies  with  fuels
like n -butane [223,226,227] , dimethyl ether [120,228] , and heav-
ier organic reactants [119,122,173,186] of n -pentane, n -heptane, 1-
hexene, and n -hexanal. However, the attempt to detect hydrogen
peroxide was not successful in n -decane oxidation [186] ; accord-
ing to the analysis, this was caused by condensation in the CRDS
cell due to the low volatility of n -decane and its many reaction
products.

The uncertainties of mole fraction depend mainly on the un-
certainties of the cross-sections used for quantification. For species
like  hydrogen  peroxide,  the  relative  uncertainties  of  the  cross-
sections are ∼20% [119] . Another source of uncertainty is the def-
inition of  the  baseline; it  is  not always possible to  consider the
maximum ring-down time as the base line. For systems presenting
a  complex  absorption  spectrum  (e.g.,  n- butane  oxidation),  peaks
are very close, and the ring-down time does not go back to the
baseline. This challenge can result in a relative uncertainty of 5%
in the absorption coefficient in some unfavorable cases. To mini-
mize uncertainty, the ring-down times at both sides of the peak
were usually chosen and an average value used. Overall, relative
uncertainties in the mole fractions of the closed shell species in
Table 2 quantified by cw -CRDS are usually ∼30%.

Note that some molecules (large alkanes) present a continuous
absorption over the entire range of wavelengths investigated. This
absorption causes a shift of the baseline, depending on the con-
centration of the molecule. This shift is especially notable when
the molecule is the initial reactant; the shift does not affect the
uncertainties, but it reduces the sensitivity.

3.2. Main experimental results of hydroperoxide analysis

3.2.1. Hydrogen peroxide

As  is  shown  in  Fig.  1 ,  the  preferred  way  to  produce  hydro-
gen peroxide is by disproportionation of two HO  ̇O radicals (and in
some special cases, by the H-abstraction from fuel by HO  ̇O radical,
not shown in Fig. 1 ), and the dominant way to consume hydrogen
peroxide is by decomposition into two   ̇OH radicals. As a branching
reaction, H
2 dissociation is of particular importance for trigger-
ing the start of second stage engine autoignition [230] . Hydrogen
peroxide concentrations were also measured in studies of burner

2 O

stabilized cool flames; these were first performed by Carlier et al.
[231] using electronic paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in an
n -butane cool flame. Because a recent review focuses on cool flame
studies [232] , this subject will not be detailed here.

Due to its high reactivity, detection of hydrogen peroxide is not
obvious; its mole fractions were rarely reported in the literature,
even if its formation in gas phase oxidation is proven very early
[136] .  Analytical  methods  with  direct  sampling  strategies  (sonic
probe, molecular beam) are required to obtain reliable data for this
species. The following sections describe significant results related
to quantification of hydrogen peroxide under reactor conditions.

This discussion is divided into two parts: (1) data recorded in
hydrocarbon oxidation studies, and (2) data obtained during oxi-
dation studies of biofuel components. There is an increasing inter-
est in molecules found in biofuels as they can substitute – at least
partially – conventional fuels from crude oil [233–236] . Among the
fuels obtained from biomass, ethers are promising candidates. The
oxidation of dimethyl ether (DME, CH
3 ), the simplest ether
has been studied extensively, as reviewed in Ref. [120] . Hydrogen
peroxide was detected in several independent studies of DME ox-
idation using molecular-beam mass spectrometry (both EI and PI)
[157,175,237] and cw -CRDS [120,228] . Table 3 summarizes the ex-
perimental measurement of hydrogen peroxide during gas phase
oxidation of fuels.

3 OCH

Hydrocarbons: Hydrogen peroxide was first detected in a low-
temperature  JSR  oxidation  study  of  n -butane  by  SVUV-PIMS
[154,238] . At that time, no data was available for the cross-section
of hydrogen peroxide, and an estimated value of 8.58 Mb at 11 eV
was used for quantification. This estimation was based on the cor-
relation proposed by Koizumi [242] . Predictions from a model de-
veloped by the authors [238] over-estimated the experimental data
by a factor of ∼ 50. Recently, Dodson et al. [200] measured the
cross-section of hydrogen peroxide from the ionization threshold
up to 12 eV; they obtained a cross-section of 1.213 Mb at 11.008 eV,
which was about seven times lower than the previous estimated
value. Thus, using the measured cross-section, the model predic-
tion is approaching the experimental value.

Additional  n -butane  oxidation  experiments  were  performed
later  at  CNRS-Nancy  using  cw -CRDS  over  a  wider  tempera-
ture  range  (covering  both  low  and  high  temperature  chemistry
[226,227] ).  Higher  dilution  than  in  previous  SVUV-PIMS  experi-
ment was adopted because n -butane presented a continuous ab-
sorption in the investigated wavelength range and caused a shift of
the ring-down time baseline. Along with hydrogen peroxide, water,
formaldehyde  and  ethylene  were  detected.  Figure  13  shows  that
the  experimental  mole  fraction  profile  of  hydrogen  peroxide  ex-
hibits two peaks. As described previously, these two peaks corre-
spond to the two reaction zones induced by NTC behavior.

As  shown  in  Fig.  13 ,  the  kinetic  model  [227]  also  pre-
dicted  these  two  peaks.  The  agreement  between  experimental

hydrogen peroxide in the low-temperature region. It was observed
at ∼ 630 K in the CRNS-Nancy experiment, but at ∼ 670 K in the
CNRS-Orléans  experiment.  There  is  no  obvious  explanation  for
these  discrepancies,  especially  for  the  shift  of  the  temperature
corresponding  to  the  peak  mole  fraction.  Interestingly,  the  shift
was  observed  for  hydrogen  peroxide,  but  not  for  formaldehyde.
New n -butane experiments with other diagnostic techniques (e.g.
SVUV-PIMS), could provide additional data and help confirm these
results.

Hydrogen peroxide was also detected in the oxidation of larger
alkanes.  Rodriguez  et  al.  [173,186]  quantified  this  species  during
the  oxidation  of  n- pentane  and  n- heptane  using  cw- CRDS.  In  a
later JSR oxidation study of n -heptane, Wang et al. also observed
the formation of hydrogen peroxide [146] . Figure 14 presents the
data for hydrogen peroxide at several equivalence ratios during n-
pentane and n- heptane oxidation. The models from Galway satis-
factorily predicted the mole fractions of hydrogen peroxide in the
low-temperature reaction zone [88,111] . However, the model sig-
nificantly overpredicted the mole fraction of hydrogen peroxide in
the high-temperature reaction zone. This phenomenon is also ob-
served for n -butane oxidation in Fig. 13 .

2 O

Furthermore, the oxidation of both alkanes was studied in the
low-temperature region (50 0–70 0 K) using SVUV-PIMS at the Na-
tional  Synchrotron  Radiation  Laboratory  in  Hefei  [173,186] .  The
main difference was that the carrier gas at Nancy was helium, and
argon  was  used  in  Hefei.  Figure  14  also  displays  the  mole  frac-
2  obtained  by  SVUV-PIMS  in  n -pentane  and
tion  profiles  of  H
n -heptane oxidation. Note that in both cases, the authors extrap-
olated the cross-sections of H
2  from the data by Dodson et al.
[200] to calculate the mole fractions of hydrogen peroxide mea-
sured at 13.05 eV. Despite this approximation, excellent agreement
of  the  two  datasets  by  cw- CRDS  and  SVUV-PIMS  was  observed.
Moreover,  no  temperature  shift  was  observed  between  the  two
mole fraction profiles, which were obtained by different JSRs and
sampling methods in the two experiments [173,186] .

Meng  et  al.  [119]  revisited  the  low-temperature  oxidation  of
1-alkenes, which has considerable chemical specificity due to the
presence of the double bond. They performed 1-hexene oxidation
experiments in a JSR and measured hydrogen peroxide mole frac-
tions by cw -CRDS. Because of the NTC behavior and similar to alka-
nes (discussion in Section 3.1.1 ), two peaks in mole fraction pro-
file of hydrogen peroxide were observed in different temperature

measurement  and  model  prediction  was  good  in  the  low-
temperature zone, but the model over-estimated the mole fractions
by a factor of ∼ 4 in the high-temperature regime. In the model,
the kinetic parameters for the decomposition of hydrogen perox-
ide by Baulch et al. [243] were updated to the new values by Troe
[244] . As shown in Figs. 1 and 2 in Ref. [227] , using the new rate
parameters did not improve H
2 prediction above 800 K, but led
to better agreement of the overall reactivity. The authors also pro-
posed a consumption reaction of hydrogen peroxide on the wall.
After including this reaction, the model prediction agreed better
with  the  experiment  (dotted  line  in  Fig.  13 ).  Additional  experi-
ments performed in a JSR with silicium coating (Siliconert TM 20 0 0,
provided by SilcoTek) did not show any significant difference (Fig.
9 in Ref. [227] ) compared to the original JSR. But, this did not ab-
solutely confirm that wall effects could not occur.

Djehiche and coworkers [223] later repeated the n -butane oxi-
dation experiment by Bahrini et al. [226] using the cw -CRDS setup
built  at  CNRS-Orléans.  The  comparison  of  both  datasets  showed
that the H
2 mole fractions obtained at Orléans were two times
larger  than  those  measured  in  Nancy.  Another  difference  was
the  temperature  that  corresponds  to  the  peak  mole  fraction  of

Biofuels : Hydrogen peroxide was first quantified in biofuel sys-
tem in the oxidation of linear ethers. Guo et al. [175] reported the
first direct measurement of hydrogen peroxide during the oxida-

tion of DME. The quantification of H

2 ; the experiment was performed in a flow
reactor in the low-temperature region of 490–750 K. A molecular
beam was used for direct sampling and EI-MS for detection. Re-
sults showed DME to be a somewhat reactive molecule, which be-
gins to react at ∼550 K. A significant production of hydrogen per-
oxide was also reported, and an early peak mole fraction at 600 K
(Fig.  4  in  Ref.  [175] ).  Model  predictions  in  the  literature  for  hy-
drogen peroxide were satisfactory, but fuel conversion was signifi-
cantly over-estimated at around 600 K (Fig. 3b in Ref. [175] ). Later,
Kurimoto et al. [237] extended the operating conditions of these
experiments and refined the kinetic model.

Rodriguez et al. [120] also detected hydrogen peroxide during
the JSR oxidation of DME over a wider temperature range (500–
1100 K),  using  cw- CRDS.  As  indicated  by  the  selectivity  diagram
in  Fig.  15 (a),  hydrogen  peroxide  was  among  the  main  reaction
products of DME oxidation at 625 K. This temperature corresponds
to the peak mole fraction of H
2  in the low-temperature reac-
2 O
tion zone ( Fig. 15 (b)). These observations are consistent with those
of  Guo  et  al.  [175] .  Figure  15 (b)  shows  that  predictions  using  a
model updated by the authors under-estimated the mole fractions
of  hydrogen  peroxide  across  the  studied  temperature  range,  and
especially under stoichiometric and fuel-lean conditions. The un-
2  mole  fraction  by  the  model  in  the  high-
derestimation  of  H

temperature  region  was  in  contrast  to  the  observation  of  C

Moshammer et al. [182] , in which the models over-predicted the
H

2 mole fraction.
Le Tan et al. [228] also studied the JSR oxidation of DME, con-
ducting experiments over a temperature range of 540–840 K and
using cw- CRDS to detect HO  ̇O radical and hydrogen peroxide. The
cw- CRDS also measured H
2 O. Models in the literature
2 O and CH
were used to predict the temperature-dependent mole fractions of
these four intermediates. DME reactivity predicted by the models
could  not  be  evaluated  because  the  DME  mole  fraction  was  not
measured;  however,  the  measured  temperature  dependence  and
mole fraction of H
2  was satisfactorily predicted by a model in
the literature [245] .

2 O

The  formation  of  hydrogen  peroxide  was  also  reported  by
Moshammer  et  al.  [182]  during  the  JSR  oxidation  of  DME  (470–
990 K)  using  SVUV-PIMS.  The  photoionization  cross-section  used
was  from  Dodson  et  al.  [200] .  Similar  to  the  work  of  Rodriguez
et al. [120] , the experimental temperature dependence of hydrogen
peroxide mole fraction displayed two maxima: one at around 600 K
and another at around 800 K. Literature models [120,245,246] pre-
dicted this dependence well, but the computed values of the H
2 O

a factor from about two to at least five, across the studied temper-
ature range. Interestingly, Moshammer et al. showed that three dif-
ferent up-to-date models predicted largely different H
2 concen-
trations in the high-temperature range, clearly revealing the need
for further improvement of detailed chemical mechanisms.

The  temperature  dependence  of  the  mole  fraction  of  hydro-
gen  peroxide  has  also  been  observed  by  Sun  et  al.  [239]  during
the  JSR  oxidation  of  dimethoxymethane  (DMM,  CH
3 ),
using  SVUV-PIMS.  The  JSR  was  operated  at  temperatures  from
488 to 869 K and pressure close to one atmosphere, with a mix-
ture  at  φ =  0.5  and  with  2%  of  fuel.  The  hydrogen  peroxide
mole fraction was evaluated using the cross-section published by

on the photoabsorption and photoionization cross-sections, respec-
tively.  Given  the  fact  that  the  photoionization  experiments  de-
scribed  here  were  largely  performed  at  synchrotron  facilities,  it
seems that the cw -CRDS technique is easier to implement.

In  most  cases,  the  up-to-date  mechanisms  were  challenged
to  accurately  predict  the  mole  fraction  of  H
2 ,  especially  in
the high-temperature reaction zone. This is somewhat unexpected
since  the  combustion  mechanism  of  the  H
2  system  is  well
known [249] . However, given the fact that the HO  ̇O radical is the
2 , the chemistry of HO  ̇O or the fuel-specific re-
main source for H
actions to HO  ̇O should be investigated further, since uncertainties
in the kinetic parameters for the decomposition of hydrogen per-
oxide are not expected to explain the observed deviations. From
the experimental viewpoint, the influence of the wall effect could
not be excluded either, as mentioned in Refs. [227,237] . Decompo-
sition of hydrogen peroxide at the walls of the reactor or of the
CRDS probe may affect the measurement of H
In parallel to the measurement of H

2 , experimental efforts
were  conducted  to  establish  measurement  routines  to  quantita-
tively detect HO  ̇O radicals. While considerable work has been pub-
lished regarding radical analysis in flames [188,217] , few attempts
were made to measure radicals during fuel low-temperature oxi-
dation without a combined photolysis initiation.   ̇OH and HO  ̇O rad-
icals were detected in n -butane JSR oxidation using fluorescence
assay  by  gas  expansion  technique  (FAGE),  but  the  quantification
included substantial uncertainties [250] . HO  ̇O radicals were later
measured during n -butane JSR oxidation using cw- CRDS [223] un-
der the same conditions as Ref. [250] . The shapes of the tempera-
ture dependence of HO  ̇O radicals measured by FAGE and cw -CRDS
were comparable, except for the high-temperature reaction zone:
the FAGE HO  ̇O mole fractions peaked at ∼ 900 K, whereas the cw -
CRDS HO  ̇O mole fractions peaked at ∼ 830 K. The maximum mole
fraction of HO  ̇O radicals at 650 K differed by a factor of three in
the two studies. Very good agreement was observed over the range
of 780–830 K. HO  ̇O radicals were also quantified during DME oxi-
dation in a JSR and a FT by cw- CRDS [228] and by mid-infrared
Faraday rotation spectroscopy [237,251] , respectively.

3.2.2. Alkyl hydroperoxides

In this section, recent studies on alkyl hydroperoxides will be
summarized.  Because  their  formation  pathways  are  distinct,  two
kinds of alkyl hydroperoxides were distinguished: alkyl hydroper-
oxides  with  less  carbon  atoms  than  in  the  fuel  reactant,  and
alkyl  hydroperoxides  with  the  same  carbon  skeleton  as  the  fuel
molecule (e.g., ROOH in Fig. 1 ). Dominant consumption of the two
types of organic hydroperoxides occur from the dissociation of the
O –OH bond, which leads to an alkoxy radical and an   ̇OH radical.
Table 4 summarizes gas phase oxidation studies in which attempts
to quantify alkyl hydroperoxides have been made. To the best of
our knowledge, these attempts were only performed in JSR oxida-
tion studies.

As shown in Fig. 1 , an alkyl hydroperoxide is produced mainly
from the reaction of an HO  ̇O radical with an alkyl peroxy radical
(and in some cases, by the H-abstractions from fuel by RO  ̇O radi-
cals, not shown in Fig. 1 ). In an alkyl hydroperoxide with less car-
bon atoms than the reactant, the peroxy radical is produced from
the O
2 addition to the alkyl radicals. These alkyl radicals could be
produced by β-C –C scission reactions of the fuel radicals (  ̇R) or ke-
toalkoxyl radicals [146] .

In  2010,  during  the  JSR  oxidation  of  n -butane,  Battin-Leclerc
et  al.  [123]  measured  the  temperature  dependence  of  signals  at
m/z 48 and 62 and identified them as methyl and ethyl hydroper-
oxides  by  SVUV-PIMS.  In  a  paper  that  followed  [238] ,  the  mole
fractions for these compounds were estimated; the cross-sections

In addition to the ether biofuels, aldehydes are another class of
oxygenated compounds that have reported the formation of H
2 .
Tao et al. [199] studied the oxidation of acetaldehyde in a JSR using
SVUV-PIMS after molecular-beam sampling. Although acetaldehy-
des are not currently considered to be biofuels, they are impor-
tant  intermediates  formed  in  alkanes  oxidation  [92]  and  in  the
oxidation  of  oxygenated  molecules  like  alcohols  [121] .  Figure  16
shows the temperature dependence of the H
2 mole fractions in
acetaldehyde  oxidation.  In  this  data  evaluation,  the  authors  also
adopted H
2 cross-sections measured by Dodson et al. [200] . The
authors  developed  a  model  for  acetaldehyde  oxidation  based  on
the AramcoMech 2.0 mechanism [118] . This model reproduces well
the high reactivity of acetaldehyde, but overpredicts the maximum
H

2 mole fraction by a factor of ∼ 6.
In  the  JSR  oxidation  study  of  n -butanal,  the  mole  fraction
profile  of  H
2  was  also  measured  by  SVUV-PIMS  [240] .  The
result  indicated  a  maximum  mole  fraction  of  1.3  × 10 −3  at
670 K  using  the  cross-sections  measured  by  Dodson  et  al.  [200] .
However,  a  comparison  with  the  model  prediction  was  not
shown.

Rodriguez et al. [122] investigated the oxidation of n -hexanal in
a JSR by GC and cw- CRDS. Using cw -CRDS, a large amount of hy-
drogen peroxide was measured during the oxidation of this very
reactive fuel. Its maximum mole fraction, 8.6 × 10 −4 at 650 K and
φ = 0.5, is in the same order of magnitude as those of typical low-
temperature reaction products, such as formaldehyde or acetalde-
hyde. Generally, the model developed by the authors satisfactorily

In summary, the cw -CRDS technique has proven to be a pow-
erful  tool  to  measure  mole  fractions  of  hydrogen  peroxide  dur-
ing the oxidation of fuels. It is expected that larger hydroperox-
3 OOH)), could be detected in
ides (e.g. methyl hydroperoxide (CH
other spectral regions. Application of this technique for n -heptane
and n -hexanal oxidation was successful; However, some limitation
for even larger molecules such as n -decane was observed, due to
the  condensation  in  the  CRDS  cell.  It  is  possible  that  molecular
beam  sampling,  coupled  to  a  CRDS  cell,  could  solve  this  prob-
lem.  The  SVUV-PIMS  technique  also  provided  reliable  data  for

10 eV), were based on the correlation proposed by Koizumi [242] .
In these studies, the mole fraction of butenes measured by GC was
used  as  reference.  Large  discrepancies,  with  a  factor  of  200  for
methyl hydroperoxide and a factor of 20 for ethyl hydroperoxide,
were  observed  when  comparing  the  experimental  mole  fraction
profiles to the predictions by a model in the literature [256] . The
very large discrepancies can be attributed to uncertainties in the
estimated cross-sections, for example the estimated cross-section
value for CH
3 OOH is a factor of 50 higher than the calculation of
Moshammer et al. [182] . However, the uncertainties of the kinetic
model cannot be ruled out since the model was developed using
old kinetic data and rate rules [256] .

In  subsequent  papers  for  the  JSR  oxidation  of  hydrocarbons
(e.g., propane [108] , isomers of hexane [257] , 1-hexene [254] , n-
heptane  [258] )  using  SVUV-PIMS  in  Hefei,  the  authors  did  not
mention the formation of C
2 alkyl hydroperoxides; this was be-
cause signal intensities were low and did not attract attention at
that time.

In later work, the Nancy team studied the JSR oxidation of alka-
nes using SPI-MS. In the n -pentane oxidation studied by Rodriguez
et  al.  [173] ,  the  mass  spectrum  in  Fig.  17  clearly  showed  mass
peaks at m/z = 48 and 62. Other m/z will be discussed further in
the text. This observation led to revisiting older data obtained in
Hefei and reanalyzing the PIE curve for both m/z = 48 and 62. In
comparisons to theoretical calculations, the ionization onset con-
firmed that these two peaks can be attributed to methyl and ethyl
hydroperoxides, respectively.

Rodriguez  et  al.  [186]  also  re-examined  the  JSR  oxidation  of
n- heptane  by  SPI-MS.  The  PIE  curve  obtained  by  Herbinet  et  al.
[258]  confirmed  the  species  identification.  In  addition  to  methyl

and ethyl hydroperoxides, isomers of propyl hydroperoxide were
also  detected  for  this  C
7  alkane.  These  species  were  also  ob-
served during a recent study by Wang et al. [146] on n- heptane
JSR  oxidation  using  SVUV-PIMS  and  APCI-OTMS.  Rodriguez  et  al.

[173,186] furthermore estimated the mole fractions of these C
3
hydroperoxides with cross-sections calculated using the group ad-
ditivity method proposed by Bobeldijk et al. [201] . Due to signifi-
cant fragmentation during ionization of KHPs, this group additiv-
ity method is not entirely reliable for estimating the cross-sections
for  KHPs  (see  Section  3.2.4 );  however,  it  gives  satisfactory  esti-
mations  for  some  alkyl  hydroperoxides,  as  shown  hereafter.  The
estimated cross-sections for the C
3  hydroperoxides at 10.6 eV
are 4.4 Mb, 5.1 Mb, and 5.8 Mb, respectively. The contribution of
each group was estimated from the analysis of standard species.
This  estimation  did  not  consider  the  O –OH  group  because  no
standard was available. In the mole fraction evaluation, the mole

(see  Fig.  10  for  DME);  for  n -butanal,  it  peaked  closer  to  650 K.
In all  these studies,  the  cross-section of  CH
3 OOH  employed was
the  same  as  was  theoretically  calculated  by  Moshammer  et  al.
[182]  ( Section  3.1.2.2 ).  The  calculated  cross-section  was  7  Mb  at
11 eV. This value was very close to the estimation (5 Mb at 11 eV)
by Rodriguez et al. [186] , who used the group additivity method
proposed by Bobeldijk et al. [201] . It is important to note that with
this theoretically calculated cross-section, the experimental mole
fractions of CH
3 OOH were well predicted by models of DME [120] ,
DMM [239,247] , acetaldehyde [259] , and propanal [253] . Knowing
3 O  ̇O radical chemistry has been studied much less than
that the CH
the H
2  system, it is surprising to see that in some cases the
up-to-date  models  more  closely  predicted  the  methyl  hydroper-
oxide mole fractions than that of hydrogen peroxide. In addition
to methyl hydroperoxide, ethyl hydroperoxide was also quantified
in  propanal  oxidation  [253]  and  detected  in  n -butanal  oxidation
[240] .

C n -1 alkyl radicals have been shown to be important interme-
diates during the oxidation of C n  aldehydes [259] . In a study of
propanal oxidation [253] , ethyl hydroperoxide was quantified using
the cross-section in Ref. [186] , which was based on the group addi-
tivity method proposed by Bobeldijk et al. [201] . The cross-section
value was 7.6 Mb at 11 eV. This is a reasonable increase compared
to the 5.1 Mb at 10.6 eV, mentioned above [182] . The mole fraction
profile obtained was well predicted using the model proposed by
the authors. The analysis shows that the decomposition of methyl
and ethyl hydroperoxides were the dominant source of hydroxyl
radicals at 675 K for all equivalence ratios (i.e., φ = 0.35, 1.0, and
4.0). Propyl hydroperoxide was quantified during the oxidation of
n -butanal  [240] .  With  a  cross-section  estimated  to  be  5  Mb  at
11 eV, the obtained mole fraction profile was well predicted using
the model of Pelucchi et al. [260] . It was noted that in the quantifi-
cation of C
3 hydroperoxides, these studies used values between
5–8 Mb at 11 eV for the three compounds.

Different  from  the  C

3  hydroperoxides  mentioned
2 ,  and  C
above, the alkyl hydroperoxides with the same carbon skeleton as
the reactant were derived directly from the alkyl peroxy radicals.
These radicals were produced by the O
2 addition to the fuel rad-
icals (  ̇R). Because the isomerizations of alkyl peroxy radicals com-
peted directly with the pathways that form this type of alkyl hy-
droperoxide, their production became less favorable when the iso-
merization routes were easier. In fact, a long carbon chain of the
reactant favors these isomerizations. This may explain the discov-
ery that alkyl hydroperoxides with the same carbon skeleton as the
reactant were observed only in C
5 fuels. However, it should be
noted that in a recent study of n- heptane oxidation, Wang et al.
[146] observed a peak at m/z 132, corresponding to the C
7  alkyl
hydroperoxides.

For  the  pentyl  hydroperoxides  measured  by  Rodriguez  et  al.
[173]  during  n -pentane  JSR  oxidation  (see  m/z = 104  in  Fig.  17 ),
mole fractions were derived from the cross-section (i.e., 15.1 Mb
at 11 eV) evaluated using the group additivity method proposed by
Bobeldijk et al. [201] . Good agreement was observed between pre-
dictions from the recent Galway pentane model [111] and the ex-
perimental mole fractions.

In summary, it appears that for the C

3 hydroperoxides and
pentyl  hydroperoxides,  the  mole  fractions  obtained  from  cross-
section by calculation and group additivity method are consistent
with predictions from the up-to-date kinetic models.

Figure 18 presents the experimental mole fractions of these three

the order of methyl hydroperoxide > ethyl hydroperoxide > propyl
hydroperoxide; the mole fraction of propyl hydroperoxide is much
lower, i.e., below 5 ppm.

3 alkyl radicals than those for C

For methyl and ethyl hydroperoxides, the model reproduced the
shape of the experimental profiles well, as well as the influence of
the equivalence ratio from 0.25 to four. The predicted mole frac-
tions were nevertheless a factor of three to five times larger than
the  experimental  measurements;  this  discrepancy  is  not  signifi-
cant considering that the estimated cross-sections had significant
uncertainties. However, bad prediction of the temperature depen-
dence for propyl hydroperoxides indicates larger kinetic uncertain-
ties for the reactions of C
2 alkyl
radicals. It was particularly noted that the model drastically over-
7 OOH  intermediates  at  very  low
predicted  the  formation  of  C
3  alkyl hydroper-
temperatures, i.e. according to the model, the C
2 alkyl hy-
1 and C
oxide formed at lower temperatures than the C
droperoxides. It was also noted that the measured equivalence ra-
tio effect on propyl hydroperoxides was slightly different from that
of methyl and ethyl hydroperoxides. The reason for this inconsis-
tency is still unclear.

3 hydroperoxides were also measured in 1-hexene JSR
oxidation using SPI-MS [119] ; their quantification used the calibra-
tion method proposed in Refs. [173,186] . Predictions using a model
developed  by  the  authors  agreed  with  the  experimental  results
within a factor of two for methyl and ethyl hydroperoxides, and
a factor of four for propyl hydroperoxides.

Olefinic hydroperoxides can be produced by combination of an
alkenyl radical with an HO  ̇O radical, and the bimolecular reaction
of HO  ̇O with RO  ̇O, which is produced from the O
2 addition to the
alkenyl radical [254] . Alkenyl radicals are mainly produced by H-
abstractions from alkenes. Due to the presence of the double bond,

resonance-stabilized radicals  may  be  formed;  these  – as  well  as
HO  ̇O radicals – are the predominant radicals observed before en-
gine autoignition of olefins. For alkane fuels, olefinic hydroperox-
ides can also be produced from hydroperoxyalkyl radicals (  ̇QOOH
in Fig. 1 ) by β-scission reactions, or abstraction reactions by O
2 .
In the case of olefinic hydroperoxides with the same carbon skele-
ton as the alkane reactant, another pathway should be considered:
the elimination of HO  ̇O radical from hydroperoxyalkylperoxy radi-
cals (  ̇OOQOOH in Fig. 1 ) and/or dihydroperoxyalkyl radicals. Dihy-
droperoxyalkyl radicals can be obtained from   ̇OOQOOH radicals by
internal isomerizations [100] . Further explanation about these un-
conventional pathways are given in Section 3.2.5 .

1-hexene. The SVUV-PIMS in Hefei detected a signal at m/z = 116.
Experimentally measured ionization energy is consistent with the
values  from  theoretical  calculations  ( ∼ 9.25 eV)  for hexenyl  hy-
droperoxides.  This  m/z  at  116  was  also  detected  by  Meng  et  al.
[119] in their JSR oxidation study of 1-hexene using SPI-MS. The
m/z = 74 that corresponds to C

5 OOH was also measured.

Rodriguez et al. [173 , 186] also detected olefinic hydroperoxides
by  SPI-MS  in  their  JSR  oxidation  studies  of  alkanes.  The  identi-
fication of these peroxides was achieved via PIE curves obtained
by  SVUV-PIMS.  For  example,  the  signal  at  m/z = 74,  88,  and  102
in Fig. 17 for n- pentane oxidation, corresponds to isomers of al-
lyl hydroperoxide, butenyl hydroperoxides, and pentenyl hydroper-
oxides, respectively. During the JSR oxidation of three alkanes ( n-
pentane, n- heptane, and n- decane), olefinic hydroperoxides with C
3
up to C x carbon chain were detected, with x being the number of
carbon atoms of the reactant. However, the heptenyl and octenyl
hydroperoxides were not measured during n- decane oxidation. In
a recent work on n- heptane oxidation, Wang et al. [146] also de-
tected the olefinic hydroperoxides from C

3 to C

The m/z ratio corresponding to olefinic hydroperoxides with the
same carbon skeleton as the reactant was detected by SVUV-PIMS
during the JSR oxidation of a wide range of linear, branched and
cyclic  C
12  alkanes,  and  biofuel  components  [146,174,255,261] .
Examples of recorded mass spectra are given in Fig. 19 . This fig-
ure shows that hydroperoxides which include a C = C bond while
keeping the same structure as the reactant, are not only formed in
alkanes oxidation (panels (A) to (J)), but are also produced when
oxygenated  fuels  with  long  carbon  chains  are  used  as  reactants
(panels (K) to (O)).

In a time-resolved SVUV-PIMS study of the tetrahydrofuran ox-
idation  initiated  by  photolysis  in  a  FT  at  1.3 kPa,  Antonov  et  al.
[262]  reported  a  signal  at  m/z = 102,  which  they  attributed  to
2,3-dihydrofuranyl hydroperoxide. This intermediate was identified
from a comparison between experimental and theoretically calcu-
lated ionization energies ( ∼8.57 eV).

The  temperature  dependence  of  the  signal  of  an  olefinic  hy-
droperoxide  was  plotted  during  the  JSR  oxidation  study  of  2-
methylhexane  (see  Fig.  3 b  of  Ref.  [255] ).  However,  due  to  the
lack  of  photoionization  cross-sections,  this  intermediate  was  not
quantified.

In  Refs.  [119,173,186]  for  n -pentane,  n -heptane,  n -decane,  and
1-hexene  oxidation,  the  temperature  profiles  of  all  the  detected
olefinic  hydroperoxides  were  systematically  plotted.  Tentative
quantifications of these peroxides were performed based on cross-
sections  evaluated  using  the  group  additivity  method  proposed
by  Bobeldijk  et  al.  [201] .  Models  of  n -pentane  [111] ,  n -heptane
[88] ,  n -decane  [186]  and  1-hexene  [119]  in  the  literature  were
adopted  to  predict  the  mole  fraction  of  these  olefinic  hydroper-
oxides.  In  contrast  to  the  prediction  of  alkyl  hydroperoxides  by
these models, significantly larger deviations between experiments

and  simulations  were  observed  for  the  olefinic  hydroperoxides.
Among the olefinic hydroperoxides, the deviations were generally
3  species; the largest deviations were observed
the smallest for C
when the corresponding combination reaction of an alkenyl radi-
cal with an HO  ̇O radical was not included in the model.

2 –C

In  summary,  with  recent  progress  in  mass  spectrometry
methods,  a  wide  range  of  alkyl  hydroperoxides  and  olefinic  hy-
droperoxides  has  been  detected  during  gas  phase  oxidation  of
numerous C
12 alkanes, alkenes and oxygenated molecules. Due
to  the  difficulty  in  acquiring  photoionization  cross-sections  of
these  species,  quantification  studies  are  scarce  and  often  prone
to  significant  uncertainty.  However,  in  the  case  of  CH
3 OOH,
the cross-sections could be theoretically calculated, and a reliable
quantification was achieved. The up-to-date models also satisfacto-
rily predicted the mole fraction of CH
3 OOH, indicating satisfactory
understanding of the oxidation kinetics of this small peroxide. In
larger  alkyl  hydroperoxides,  as  well  as  olefinic  hydroperoxides,
large  discrepancies  between  experimental  and  modeling  results
were generally observed. Both the accuracy of the photoionization
cross-sections and the reaction kinetics of these species must be
improved,  e.g.,  synthesizing  the  peroxides  and  measuring  their
photoionization cross-sections, improving the method of photoion-
ization cross-sections calculation, and exploring the key reaction
pathways and calculating the rate coefficients.

3.2.4. Ketohydroperoxides

KHPs  have  been  included  in  the  kinetic  models  ever  since
the  pioneering  work  of  Sahetchian  et  al.  [147] ,  and  the  semi-
nal  paper  of  Curran  et  al.  [98] .  Only  recently,  however,  Battin-
Leclerc  et  al.  [123]  discovered  strong  experimental  evidence  for
the presence of KHPs. The authors coupled a JSR with molecular-
beam  sampling  and  mass-spectrometric  detection  using  single-
photon ionization via synchrotron radiation. In a series of papers
[123,154,238] , the groups of Battin-Leclerc and Qi reported the de-
tection,  identification  and  tentative  quantification  of  the  KHP  in
low-temperature oxidation of n -butane. Since the detection of the
KHPs was reported for n -butane, experimental evidence for KHPs
in the low-temperature oxidation of many other hydrocarbons and
oxygenated fuels has been published (e.g., Ref. [174,254,255,263] ).
Chemical  ionization  and  laser-based  photoionization  techniques
have also made it possible to detect KHP in non-synchrotron-based
experiments, e.g. Ref. [146,173] . Table 5 lists studies that have mea-
sured the temperature dependence of mole fractions, or signals of
KHP.

Whereas  Table  5  indicates  that  KHPs  were  detected  when
3 )
DME, propanal, n -butanal, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (CH
and  C
4 +  alkanes  were  used  as  fuel,  KHPs  were  not  observed
when propane oxidation was studied using SVUV-PIMS [108] , even
though  propyl  hydroperoxide  was  observed  ( Table  4 ).  Note  that
3 , cor-
the JSR oxidation of n -butanal [240] detected a KHP, C
responding  to  the  KHP  expected  from  propyl  radical  oxidation.
This  KHP  is  an  important  intermediate  during  the  oxidation  of
n -butanal.

For  a  long  time,  the  high  reactivity  of  these  multi-functional
intermediates  hampered  their  detection;  as  described  in
Section  3.1.2 ,  molecular-beam  sampling  and  soft  ionization  mass
spectrometric techniques made their direct measurement possible.
The main approach to the identification of KHPs is the exact m/z
ratio  in  the  high-resolution  mass-spectrometric  detection  (e.g.,
TOF), which provides information about their chemical composi-
tion. Furthermore, observed ionization energy and fragmentation
patterns have proved to be very helpful and should be considered
when  identifying  KHPs.  While  this  approach  worked  for  DME
[182]  and  neo -pentane  [263] ,  in  which  only  one  KHP  isomer
is  conceivable,  more  work  is  needed  for  the  identification  and

separation of different isomeric structures when molecular struc-
ture of the fuel becomes more complex.

In their neo -pentane work [263] , Eskola et al. measured time-
dependent signal profiles of KHP at different pressures, tem pera-
tures, and oxygen concentrations in a flow reactor, with chlorine-
initiated production of the respective radicals. For this molecule,
only  one γ -KHP  isomer  can  be  formed.  Their  results  at  206 kPa
2 concentration also increased
and 575 K showed that increasing O
the relative intensity of the KHP signal ( Fig. 20 ). The authors used a

recent neo -pentane model [110] to simulate their observations. The
time-dependent profile shape of KHP, and its temperature- and O
2
concentration-dependent  production  were  well  predicted  by  the
model.

In recent work by Koritze et al. [265] , the KHP in cyclohexene
oxidation was measured using the same type of experimentation.
Interestingly, the PIE curve obtained for the KHPs was very sim-
ilar to those measured for KHPs in n -butane oxidation [154 , 158] ,
this  may  be  due  to  the  probable  consequence  of  ionization  by

emitting a valence electron from the same structural feature – in
this  case  the  –OOH  function  – and  leading  to  similar  electronic
structure.

Identification of several isomeric KHPs was not reported during
the preparation of this review; however, the isomeric contributions
of KHPs is of critical importance to understanding low-temperature
oxidation chemistry, because isomeric ratios of KHPs are ultimately
linked to initial H-abstraction reactions [254 , 257] . When consider-
ing complex molecules, more than one initial hydrogen abstraction
reaction can occur, forming different RO  ̇O and   ̇QOOH radicals.

The  correct  level  of  theoretical  calculations  of  ionization  en-
ergies  and  fragmentation  patterns  is  an  important  aspect  in  the
identification of KHPs. It should be noted that identification based
on PIE curves alone can be unreliable because of the conformer-
dependence of the PIE curve. Also, these flexible molecules may
have small Franck-Condon overlaps near the ionization threshold,
which  cause  a  weak  signal  that  is  difficult  to  interpret.  Further-
more, given the large molecular structures, calculations for the ion-
ization  energies  become  more  complex  and  the  associated  error
bars larger. A unique identification based on the observed and cal-
culated ionization threshold becomes complicated.

The conversion of the mass spectra into temperature-dependent
mole fraction profiles is only possible if the absolute photoioniza-
tion cross-section is known. In the n -butane oxidation experiments
of Herbinet et al. [238] , KHP was quantified based on an estimated
photoionization cross-section and using the butene mole fraction
measured by GC as the reference.

Since the molecules have a similar ionization energy ( ∼9.4 eV),
the cross section for the KHP was assumed to be identical to that
for tetrahydrofuran, which is in the range of 6.6–8.5 Mb from 10
to 11 eV [266] . It was noted that considerable uncertainty accom-
panies this assumption. As shown in Fig. 21 , a discrepancy within
a  factor  of  five  was  observed  between  the  model  predicted  and
the experimentally measured KHP mole fraction. This discrepancy
appears to be reasonable considering the estimation of the cross-
sections and the fact that no fragmentation patterns were consid-
ered in the analysis of KHPs.

In  further  work  on  n -pentane  [173]  and  n -heptane  [186]  ox-
idation,  photoionization  cross-sections,  based  on  the  same  addi-
tivity  rules  [201]  as  described  in  Sections  3.2.2  and  3.2.3 ,  were
used  to  quantify  KHPs.  The  resulting  mole  fraction  was  at  least
one order of magnitude smaller than the simulated values. These

discrepancies can be traced to the break-down of additivity rules
for hydroperoxide species. The derived cross-sections were unrea-
sonably large, resulting in very low concentrations. Also, additivity
rules  determine the  total  cross-sections,  thus  fragmentation pat-
terns are inherently not considered in the analysis, leading to ad-
ditional uncertainties in the procedures used to convert mass spec-
tral signals into mole fraction profiles.

To overcome these problems, Moshammer et al. [182] used cal-
culated photoionization cross-sections that were found to be good
within a factor of two ( Fig. 10 ) for the small sized molecules they
studied. They also found that most of the mass spectral signal of
the HPMF (the KHP in the DME oxidation), appears on a fragment
peak at m/z = 64 (CH
3 ), confirming the importance of including
fragmentation patterns, even when using the near-threshold ion-
ization with synchrotron techniques.

Fragments are  quite  common  in  mass  spectrometry  and  they
can be useful for identification purposes; however, when analyzing
a complex reacting mixture, fragmentations can preclude the exact
quantitative  interpretation  of  the  mass  spectra.  Sometimes  frag-
mentation cannot be avoided, even at narrow photon energy distri-
bution and single-photon ionization close to the ionization energy.
In the work of Moshammer et al. [182] , the identification of CH
4 O
3
as a fragment was based on a) the fragment signal with the same
temperature trace as the signal of the parent ion, and b) theoretical
calculations of the fragment appearance energies, which could be
compared to the measured onsets in the synchrotron-based mass-
selected PIE scans. This assignment is consistent with the loss of
CO after ionization of formic acid esters (note that HPMF can be
considered a formic acid ester) [267] . Using this approach, reason-
able concentration profiles were determined that compared favor-
ably with the simulations; this is important to note, because the
DME oxidation chemistry could be interpreted as being well un-
derstood.

The JSR oxidation study of hexane isomers performed in Hefei
[257]  has  shown  that  the  structure  of  the  fuel  molecule  affects
the  formation  of  KHPs.  Figure  22  shows  that  the  maxima  of
the  KHP  signal  is  observed  at  553 K  for  n -hexane,  580 K  for  2-
methylpentane, and 600 K for 3-methylpentane. This phenomenon
is related mainly to the reactivity of the fuel molecules; it also in-
dicates that KHP is an indicator of the intramolecular isomerization
propensity, e.g., branching of the molecule hinders isomerization of
the peroxy radicals.

A recent study on the ozone-assisted oxidation of ethylene also
revealed the formation of KHP. The experiment was carried out in
a JSR from 300 K to 10 0 0 K. The KHP (i.e. HOOCH
2 CHO) was suc-
cessfully identified using a combination of the PIE curve recorded
by SVUV-PIMS and ab-initio calculations of the corresponding ion-
ization energy. In the quantification, an estimated photoionization

cross-section of 5 Mb at 10.5 eV resulted in 5 ppm of KHP at 300 K
[48] .

In  summary,  the  detection,  identification,  and  quantification
of  KHPs  have  become  possible  in  recent  years.  Advanced  mass-
spectrometric techniques have become routine; but, using current
techniques, the isomeric identification of the KHPs in complex sys-
tems is still challenging. Methods to extract concentration profiles
have  been  successfully  improved  and  tested  over  the  last  years;
however, these techniques, which heavily rely on theoretical cal-
culations for fragmentation patterns and ionization cross-sections,
are still associated with significant uncertainties, limited to small
size molecules, and requiring refinement for future procedures.

3.2.5. More complex hydroperoxides

The organic peroxides mentioned above - especially those with
the same carbon skeleton as the fuel molecule - could be produced
from the RO  ̇O and   ̇OOQOOH radicals in cycles 1 and 2 of Fig. 1 . The
observation of olefinic hydroperoxides with the same carbon skele-
ton as the fuel molecule indicates that the   ̇OOQOOH radicals could
undergo HO  ̇O concerted elimination and/or further intramolecular
H-atom isomerization to produce dihydroperoxyalkyl radical. One
example from the 2,5-dimethylhexane low-temperature oxidation
is shown in Fig. 23 .

For the   ̇OOQOOH radical in Fig. 23 (a) (apart from the standard
isomerization to  the  KHP  by  abstracting the  H-atom  adjacent  to
the  –OOH  group  via  a  six-member  ring  transition  state,  and  by
immediate elimination of an OH), it could undergo an alternative
isomerization to dihydroperoxyalkyl radical (  ̇P(OOH)
2 ) by abstract-
ing  the  tertiary  C –H  (via  a  seven-member  ring  transition  state)
[104] . Intramolecular H-atom abstraction of the C –H alpha to the
–OOH group by an –O  ̇O is the standard isomerization usually con-
sidered in models in the literature [98 , 101] ; intramolecular H-atom
abstraction from a C –H–not alpha to the –OOH group by an –O  ̇O
is  an  alternative  isomerization.  The  lower  bond  dissociation  en-
ergy of the tertiary C –H makes this pathway feasible [104] . This is
also indicated by the estimated rate constants in Fig. 23 . Once the
2  radical is produced, it undergoes concerted β-C –O scis-
 ̇P(OOH)
sion to form an olefinic hydroperoxide, or it undergoes cyclization
to form a hydroperoxy cyclic ether (HPCE), an isomer of the keto-
hydroperoxide [109] . The formation of HPCE was already indicated
by Battin-Leclerc et al. [154] in n -butane low-temperature oxida-
tion modeling in 2011. Here we define the position of the –OOH
2 radical as β, γ , δ,
group relative to the radical site in the   ̇P(OOH)
etc. The radical site is at the α position. For the β-  ̇P(OOH)
2  rad-
ical in Fig. 23 (a), its dissociation rate is fast, making the further
2  addition  to  the  radical  site  unfavorable,  especially  under  rel-
O
atively low pressure (e.g. below 10 atm) [105] ; however, for the

et al. [104] . Rate constant of   ̇P(OOH) 2 radicals unimolecular dissociation at 500 K

compete with its unimolecular reactions, as indicated in Fig. 23 (b).
The existence of this channel was also indicated by Jensen et al.
[73] during liquid phase auto-oxidation of n -hexadecane. The au-
thor measured species such as trihydroperoxides and hydroperoxy
cyclic peroxides with the same skeleton as the initial fuel, allowing
them to also consider a mechanism involving three O
2 additions.
Several years later, in a gas phase oxidation study of n -dodecane
at 518 K, the group of Sahetchian [150] measured the di-, and even
tri-ketohydroperoxide.

To  explore  the  fate  of  the   ̇OOQOOH  radical  (i.e.  whether
2  addition  to
or  not  its  alternative  isomerization  and  further  O

2,5-dimethylhexane  was  investigated  by  Wang  et  al.  [261] .  The
mass  spectrum  measured  at  510 K,  employing  soft  synchrotron-
generated photons of 9.5 eV, is presented in Fig. 24 .

In addition to the mass peaks corresponding to alkene, cyclic
ether,  olefinic  hydroperoxide,  and  ketohydroperoxide,  two  addi-
tional peaks were detected that correspond to molecular formu-
4 .  The  temperature  profiles  of  these
lae  of  C
two intermediates were similar to that of the KHP, indicating that
they  contained  the  –OOH  function  group.  Analysis  of  the  frag-
ment pattern also supported the conclusion that these two species
are  peroxides.  The  C
5  intermediate  probably  has  one  car-
bonyl/keto  group  and  two  –OOH  groups  (i.e.,  a  ketodihydroper-

oxide  (KDHP)).  The  mass  interval  of  cyclic  ether  (C

Further  studies  by  Wang  et  al.  [174,255]  revealed  that  the
highly oxygenated intermediates with four and five oxygen atoms
added  to  the  fuel  molecule  were  produced  during  the  low-
temperature  oxidation  of  normal  alkanes  (e.g.,  n -heptane,  n -
decane, and n -dodecane), branched alkanes (e.g., 2-methylhexane,
2-methylnonane,  4-methylheptane,  and  2,7-dimethyloctane),  cy-
cloalkanes  (cyclohexane,  cycloheptane,  methylcyclohexane,  n -
butylcyclohexane),  aldehyde  (e.g.,  decanal),  ketone  (e.g.,  2-
decanone), alcohol (e.g., 1-decanol), ether (e.g., dipentyl ether), and
ester  (e.g.,  methyl  decanoate).  In  the  JSR  experiments  analyzed
by the SVUV-PIMS, the elemental composition of these intermedi-
ates was clarified during examination of the low-temperature ox-
idation  reactions  with  O
2  as  the  oxidizer,  respectively.
In addition, the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization orbitrap
mass spectrometer, with mass resolution of ∼10 0,0 0 0, was used to
study the low-temperature oxidation process [146] . The highly oxy-
genated intermediates detected by the SVUV-PIMS were confirmed
by  this  additional  experiment.  The  number  of  the  –OOH  groups
in  the  highly  oxygenated  intermediates  was  clarified  by  adding
D
2 O into the low-temperature oxidation reaction system. The H/D
exchange  reaction  occurred  when  the  -OOH  group  in  the  highly

Based on these findings, Wang et al. [174] proposed a general-
ized reaction scheme for the low-temperature oxidation of hydro-
carbon and oxygenated molecules, driven by the successive reac-
tions of the fuel radical (i.e., O
2  additions and intramolecular H-
atom migrations). The important radical intermediates were RO  ̇O,
 ̇QOOH,   ̇OOQOOH,   ̇P(OOH)

3  in  Fig.  26 .
Specifically,  RO  ̇O  radicals  (peroxy  radicals)  produced  by  the  O

addition to   ̇R radicals;   ̇QOOH radicals (hydroperoxyalkyl radicals)
generated from the isomerization of RO  ̇O radicals;   ̇OOQOOH rad-
icals  (hydroperoxyalkyl  peroxy  radicals)  produced  from  the  O
2
addition  to   ̇QOOH  radicals;   ̇P(OOH)
2  radicals  (dihydroperoxyalkyl
radicals)  generated  from  the  isomerization  of   ̇OOQOOH  radicals;
 ̇OOP(OOH)

(trihydroperoxyalkyl  radicals)  formed  from  the  isomerization  of

termediates led to products with zero to five oxygen atoms added
to  the  fuel  molecules.  Possible  structures  of  these  products  are

The formation of the highly oxygenated intermediates with five
oxygen atoms added to the fuel radical is affected by its molec-
ular structure. The relative ratios of the highly oxygenated prod-
ucts  with  five  oxygen  atoms,  to  ketohydroperoxide  with  three
oxygen  atoms,  in  the  oxidation  of  n -heptane,  2-methylhexane,
2,5-dimethylhexane, cycloheptane, n -decane, 2-methylnonane, 2,7-
dimethyloctane, n -butylcyclohexane, were estimated by assuming
that these two types of species have the same total photoionization
cross-sections. Under the experimental conditions of near one at-
mosphere, equivalence ratio of 1.0, and argon dilution of ∼88%, the
ratio varied between 1% ( n -heptane) and 13% ( n -butylcyclohexane),
as shown in Fig. 27 . The general trends were (1) for molecules with
the same functional group, the longer carbon chain increased the

The observation of highly oxygenated intermediates was made
in  an  ideal  reactor  under  much  lower  pressure  than  that  of
engine  combustion.  One  question  is  whether  these  highly  oxy-
genated intermediates from the generalized low-temperature oxi-
dation mechanism are produced in engine relevant conditions. To
answer this question, Wang et al. [146] investigated n -heptane low-
temperature oxidation in both a JSR and a CFR engine. Conditions
for the JSR experiment included 1% of fuel, equivalence ratio of 1.0,
and a pressure of 101.3 kPa. CFR engine specifications and test con-
ditions are shown in Table 6 . Under these conditions, n -heptane
was partially oxidized, while ignition was avoided.

The  products  of  n -heptane  low-temperature  oxidation  in  the
JSR were sampled via a molecular-beam and analyzed by SVUV-
PIMS. With partial oxidation of n -heptane in the CFR engine, the
products were sampled from the exhaust line and condensed in a
trap. Methanol dissolved the products, which were then injected
into  the  atmospheric  pressure  chemical  ionization  (APCI)  source
with  a  syringe  and  analyzed  by  the  Orbitrap  mass  spectrometer
(OTMS). Intermediates, with zero to five oxygen atoms added to
the n -heptane molecule, were observed in both experiments and
are shown in Fig. 28 .

In  summary,  the  more  complex  hydroperoxides  (highly  oxy-

the fuel molecule) were observed in the low-temperature oxida-
tion of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds in an ideal reac-
tor (JSR). This type of intermediate was also observed during low-
temperature  oxidation  of  n- heptane  in  a  CFR  engine.  The  obser-

(50 0–150 0 K):

limit),
0 = [Ar] 2.5 × 10 24 T −2.3 exp( −24,534/T) cm 3 mol −1 s −1
(low-pressure limit in argon)

This rate constant evaluated for H

2 decomposition has been
adopted in many up-to-date kinetic models of hydrocarbon oxida-
tion (Ref. [88] ).

Due  to  atmospheric  implications,  the  other  reactions  of  hy-
drogen  peroxide  which  were  investigated  thoroughly  were  H-
abstractions  with   ̇OH  radicals,  O-atoms,  and  H-atoms.  Most  of
these studies were carried out near room temperature. Readers are
referred to the review by Atkinson et al. [39] in 2004. One of the
2 with hydroxyl radicals
most recent studies for the reaction of H
was performed by Hong et al. [278] , behind reflected shock waves.
The  experiments  were  carried  out  at  between  1020  and  1460 K.
Tunable diode laser absorption at 2550.96 nm was used to probe
2 O and ring dye laser absorption at 306 nm to follow   ̇OH radi-
H
cals. The authors proposed the following rate expression in their
studied temperature range:

2 O

• k = 4.6 × 10 13 exp( −2630/T) cm 3 mol −1 s −1 .

At  1020 K,  this  rate  expression leads  to  a  rate  constant  value
of  3.5 × 10 12  cm 3  mol −1  s −1 ,  slightly  faster  than  the  value  of
2.3 × 10 12  cm 3  mol −1  s −1  obtained  from  the  expression  recom-
mended by Baulch et al. [279] between 240 and 1700 K:

• k = 1.6 × 10 18 exp( −14,800/T) + 1.9 × 10 12 exp( −215 K/T) cm 3

mol −1 s −1 .

In addition to these reactions, the reaction of hydrogen peroxide
with H-atoms was also notably investigated experimentally [280–
282] (more details in the review paper by Baulch et al. [279] ) and
theoretically [283,284] . There are two channels for this reaction:

• H

2 O

2 +  ̇H (cid:2) H

2 O +  ̇OH (channel 1),

(cid:2) H

2 + HO  ̇O (channel 2).

The team of Walker [280] proposed the rate constants for the
above two reactions at temperatures higher than room tempera-
ture. In their work, the decomposition of H
2 was investigated in
the presence of hydrogen in a flow reactor between 713 and 773 K.
In 2005, a review by Baulch et al. [279] recommended the fol-

2 O

lowing rate constants for these two channels:

• k = 1.02 × 10 13 exp( −1800/T) cm 3 mol −1 s −1 (channel 1),
• k = 1.69 × 10 12 exp( −1890/T) cm 3 mol −1 s −1 (channel 2).

4.1.2. Reactions of alkyl and allyl hydroperoxides

At the temperature of interest for this review, alkyl hydroper-
oxides  decompose  primarily  by  breaking  the  weak  O –OH  bond:
ROOH = R  ̇O +  ̇OH.  Pioneering  work  by  Kirk  and  Knox  [285]  de-
termined  the  rate  constants  of  this  reaction  in  the  gas  phase
pyrolysis  of  ethyl,  iso -propyl  and  t- butyl  hydroperoxides,  mixed
with  benzene  in  a  flow  tube.  However,  the  kinetic  parameters
widely used in current models for the gas phase decomposition of
alkyl hydroperoxides were proposed in 1982 by Sahetchian et al.
[286] .  The  authors  studied  the  decomposition  of  n- heptyl-1  and
n- heptyl-2 hydroperoxides, added in a H
2  mixture flowing in
a  dynamic  reactor.  The  hydroperoxides  were  synthesized  via  a
reaction  of  heptylmethyl  sulfonates  with  30%  hydrogen  peroxide
as proposed in Refs. [6 , 7] . Rate constants were obtained by follow-
ing the evolution of the HO  ̇O radicals. HO  ̇O radical analysis was

4. Progress in understanding hydroperoxide chemistry

In parallel to hydroperoxide analyses, studies were conducted
to better understand the chemical kinetics of these reactive inter-
mediates, especially for their decomposition pathways. The few ki-
netic studies related to hydroperoxide reactions are described in
Section 4.1 . Reaction kinetics of KHPs – especially reactions lead-
ing to unusual products, such as carboxylic acids and diones – are
described in Section 4.2 . Finally, kinetic models which include the
third O
2  addition reactions are discussed in Section 4.3 , together
with the implication of these reactions in real world systems.

4.1. Kinetic studies on hydroperoxides

This section briefly summarizes kinetic studies that address hy-
droperoxide reactions. Given its higher stability compared to other
hydroperoxides, it is not surprising that hydrogen peroxide is the
most studied peroxide molecule; kinetic investigations for organic
hydroperoxides  are  scarce;  and  there  are  few  kinetic  studies  for
alkylhydroperoxides. However, there has been no experimental ki-
netic study on ketohydroperoxides and/or even more complex hy-
droperoxides.

4.1.1. Reactions of hydrogen peroxide

2 –O

Because  of  its  importance  in  explaining  the  H

2  reactiv-
ity [269] and hydrocarbon autoignition [230] , the decomposition
of  hydrogen  peroxide  [270 , 271] ,  and  its  thermodynamic  proper-
ties [272] , has been studied for several decades. However, only a
few experimental studies have been performed in the temperature
range  beyond  900 K.  In  this  temperature  condition,  this  branch-
ing reaction is important in the promotion of fuel ignition. Experi-
ments in the literature were all performed using shock tubes with
sophisticated  optical  diagnostics  [273–276] .  In  Hong  et  al.  [275] ,
the  decomposition  rate  was  followed  via  the  formation  of  H
2 O,
which  was  measured  by  tunable  laser  absorption.  H
2  decom-
position was also investigated theoretically in Ref. [277] . In 2011,

studies were performed by Vaghjiani and Ravishankara [12] , Niki
et al. [293] , and Wang and Chen [294] . The three studies used FTIR
3 OOH with a FTIR spectrum provided
spectroscopy to analyze CH
in Ref. [293] . There are two channels for the reaction of CH

with   ̇OH radicals:

performed  using  electronic  paramagnetic  resonance,  a  technique
that Sahetchian began to use in Yerevan [287] . The following rate
expressions were proposed:

• k = 1.1 × 10 16 exp( −21,892/T) s −1 ( n -heptyl-1 hydroperoxide),
• k = 7 × 10 15 exp( −20,886 K/T) s −1 ( n -heptyl-2 hydroperoxide).

The  decomposition  of  allyl  hydroperoxide  was  investigated
theoretically  by  Goldsmith  et  al.  [288]  and  a  high-pressure-limit
rate  constant  with  k = 3.1 × 10 16  T −1.5  exp( −21,580 K/T)  s −1  was
proposed. The accuracy of the rate constant for organic hydroper-
oxides  decomposition  determines  the  accuracy  of  the  model
prediction  because  the  decomposition  of  the  O –OH  bond  is  the
determining  hydroperoxide  consumption  pathway.  As  shown  in
Fig.  29 ,  the  activation  energy  of  this  reaction  has  a  significant
effect  on  tem perature  dependence  of  the  mole  fractions  of  allyl
hydroperoxide during JSR oxidation of hydrocarbon [119,186] .

Current  models  usually  use  a  single  value  for  the  rate  con-
stant of this O –OH bond decomposition and do not consider the
exact  structure  of  the  hydroperoxide.  As  demonstrated  by  the
good  agreement  between  experimental  and  modeling  results  in
the  recent  papers  reviewed  in  Section  3.2.2 ,  this  assumption  is
appropriate  for  CH
3 OOH.  However,  Sahetchian  et  al.  [286]  found
a  difference  of  2 kcal/mol  for  the  bond  dissociation  energy  be-
tween  n- heptyl-1  and  n- heptyl-2  hydroperoxides.  More  studies
on  this  decomposition  would  certainly  be  valuable  to  improve
hydroperoxide predictions.

An  accurate  prediction  of  the  hydroperoxide  also  relies  on
thermodynamic  data.  In  the  case  of  allyl  hydroperoxide  in
Fig.  29 ,  Rodriguez  et  al.  [186]  estimated  the  thermodynamic
data  using  quantum  chemistry  calculation  and  the  atomization
method. The thermodynamic values ( (cid:5)
0 (298 K), − 12.1 kcal/mol;
S
0 (298 K), 78.6 cal/mol/K; and Cp (300 K), 22.6 cal/mol/K) are close
to the evaluation of Goldsmith et al. [289] ( −11.9 ± 0.9 kcal/mol,
82.0  ± 2.1 cal/mol/K,  25.1  ± 0.7 cal/mol/K).  Several  studies  re-

For the larger hydroperoxides, however, thermodynamic data were
usually estimated by the group additivity method [88,291,292] , and
may have larger uncertainties. Further investigations on the meth-
ods would be required to better evaluate the thermodynamic prop-
erties of the complex hydroperoxides.

Due  to  the  high  interest  in  organic  hydroperoxides  in  atmo-
spheric  chemistry,  the  H-abstraction  rate  constant  by   ̇OH  radi-
cals  from  a  few  hydroperoxides  were  also  investigated,  and  the
 ̇OH radical was photolytically generated. For methyl hydroperoxide,

The experiments focused on the measurement near room tem-
perature. However, the study by Vaghjiani and Ravishankara [12] ,
3 OOH prepared by methylation of hydrogen peroxide, was
with CH
conducted in the temperature range of 203–423 K. In this work, the
following rate expressions were proposed:

• k = 1.07 × 10 12 exp(220 K/T) cm 3 mol −1 s −1 (channel 1),
• k = 1.76 × 10 12  exp(190/T) cm 3  mol −1  s −1  (channel 1 + channel

2).

These experimental data in the work of Vaghjiani and Ravis-
hankara [12] are in good agreement with theoretical calculations
by  Luo  et  al.  [295] .  Using  a  similar  experimental  method  as  for
methyl hydroperoxide, a measurement for the rate constant of the
reaction of ethyl hydroperoxide with   ̇OH radical was also reported
at  room  temperature  (3.6 × 10 12  cm 3  mol −1  s −1 )  by  Wang  and
Chen [296] .

In  addition,  the  H-abstraction  rate  constant  by   ̇OH  radicals
was measured for tert- butyl hydroperoxide [297] between 206 and
375 K:

• k = 4.21 × 10 11 exp(485/T) cm 3 mol −1 s −1 .

The kinetics of the H-abstraction by   ̇OH radicals were also in-
vestigated for hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HMHP) [298] , one of
the most abundant hydroperoxides in the atmosphere (see section
1.1), and for isoprene hydroxy hydroperoxides produced during the
atmospheric  oxidation  of  isoprene.  Further  oxidation  of  isoprene
hydroxy hydroperoxides was indicated as a source of SOA [299] .

4.2. Kinetics of ketohydroperoxides and implementation in
mechanisms

This section describes how KHP decomposition is currently un-
derstood: first through the usual unimolecular loss of an   ̇OH radi-
cal ( Section 4.2.1 ), then via unimolecular isomerization to organic
acids (the so-called Korcek mechanism ( Section 4.2.2 )), and lastly by
pathways involving dione formation ( Section 4.2.3 ), postulated af-
ter the detection of dione intermediates in hydrocarbon oxidation
[238] .

4.2.1. Unimolecular OH loss of ketohydroperoxides and subsequent
reactions

Based  on  the  measurement  by  Sahetchian  et  al.  [286]  for
the  decomposition  of  heptyl  hydroperoxides,  a  rate  constant  of
k = 1.0 × 10 16  exp( −21,640/T)  s −1  for  reaction  type  24:  Ketohy-
droperoxide  decomposition ,  was  adopted  by  Curran  et  al.  [98]  in
their  n- heptane  oxidation  model.  Since  then,  many  hydrocarbon
oxidation  models  proposed  in  the  literature  have  included  this
reaction, with a rate constant close to this value [84] (activation
energies  are  normally  in  the  ± 1 kcal/mol  range  and  A-factors
are  in  the  range  of  a  factor  of  ∼2).  Although  KHP  dissociation
with  the  release  of  the   ̇OH  is  the  crucial  step  for  fuel  ignition,
experimental  and  theoretical  studies  for  the  rate  constants  of
this  reaction  are  scarce.  Goldsmith  et  al.  [300]  used  quantum
chemistry  calculations  to  investigate  the  decomposition  of  the
γ -KHP  obtained  during  propane  oxidation.  Here,  γ -KHP  is  the
KHP,  in  which  the  carbonyl  ( –C = O)  and  hydroperoxy  ( –OOH)

groups are separated by one –CH
2 in the carbon chain. A rate con-
stant of k = 1.8 × 10 16 exp( −21,640/T) s −1 was reported. This rate
expression is close to the study of Sahetchian et al. [286] . Later,
Goldsmith  et  al.  [301]  revisited  the  calculation  of  this  reaction
by  considering  the  effect  of  non-thermal  energy  distributions  of
the γ -KHP intermediate. The result showed a possibly significant
decomposition  of  KHPs  before  thermalization,  at  higher  internal
energies and lower pressures. However, more kinetic studies from
both experimental and theoretical calculation on this type of reac-
tion would certainly be of interest, and beneficial to the improve-
ment  of  hydrocarbon  oxidation  modeling.  Moreover,  the  reliable
measurements of KHP concentrations could help to establish a rate
constant when models are tuned to predict the experimental data.
As shown in Fig. 30 , in hydrocarbon oxidation, the decomposi-
tion of KHP via the loss of an   ̇OH radical leads to ketoalkoxyl rad-
icals. On one hand, the β-C –C scission of this radical through the
C –C bond close to the carbonyl group leads to aldehydes – impor-
tant intermediates during low-temperature oxidation (channel 1).
On the other hand, the β–C –C scission of this radical through the
C –C bond away from the carbonyl group produces diones (channel
2), as will be discussed in Section 4.2.3 . Estimated rate constants
indicate that these two channels are competitive. A recent study of
n -heptane low-temperature oxidation [146] detected diones with
two to six carbon numbers, confirming the feasibility of this sec-
ond reaction channel.

Furthermore, in ether oxidation, the decomposition of the KHP
via the   ̇OH loss is a source of acids. Large amounts of acids have
been observed during the oxidation of dimethyl (DME) and diethyl
(DEE) ethers.

In 20 0 0, Curran et al. [171] studied the oxidation of DME us-
ing the Princeton flow reactor; they reported formic acid as a ma-
jor product. In these experiments, formic acid was detected and
quantified by FTIR. These results were reproduced well by a model
proposed by the authors. The formation of formic acid during DME
oxidation was confirmed by further experimental studies in tubular
reactors using FTIR [303] , EI-MBMS [237,304] , and GC with thermal
conductivity detector [305] .

Similar to this previous work, Moshammer et al. [182] quanti-
fied formic acid during their JSR oxidation study of dimethyl ether.
Performic and carbonic acids were also detected. The model pre-
diction for formic acid was satisfactory using the model of Burke
et al. [245] and Wang et al. [246] . In both models, formic acid was
produced from the   ̇OCH
2 OCHO radical, the dissociation product of
HPMF (i.e., the KHP from DME oxidation), after breaking the O –OH
bond.  However,  the  specific  reaction  mechanism  for  formic  acid
from   ̇OCH
2 OCHO radical was different in the two models.
In  the  model  by  Burke  et  al.  [245] ,  the  reaction  mech-
anism  for  formic  acid  was  that  proposed  by  Curran  et  al.
[171]  in  20 0 0.  The  reaction  starts  from  the  intramolecular  iso-
merization  of   ̇OCH
2 O  ̇CO  via  a  five-member
ring  transition  state.  The  decomposition  of  this  intermediate
led  to  formic  acid  HC( = O)OH,  CO,  and  an  H-atom.  Later,  a
facile  pathway  to  formic  acid  from  the   ̇OCH
2 OCHO  radical  (i.e.,
2 OCHO (cid:2) HC( = O)OH + H  ̇CO), was explored by Andersen and
 ̇OCH
Carter [51,306] . This pathway, highlighted in Fig. 31 , was further
confirmed by Wang et al. [246] , with high level quantum chem-

2 OCHO  to  give  HOCH

istry calculations, and used in their DME oxidation model. Com-
pared to this pathway, the calculation shows that the intramolecu-
lar isomerization of   ̇OCH
2 OCHO to HOCH

2 O  ̇CO is not important.

In  addition  to  these  channels,  the  Korcek  reaction  of  HPMF
could also produce formic acid [157,182] . However, other theoreti-
cal calculation revealed that HMPF can easily dissociate into formic
acid, and the smallest Criegee intermediate (CH
2 OO) [51–54] , in-
stead  of  dissociation  via  the  Korcek  mechanism  ( Section  4.2.2 ).
This pathway could be another source of formic acid in DME low-
temperature oxidation.

In two recent JSR oxidation studies of diethyl ether (DEE) by
Serinyel et al. [169] and by Tran et al. [307] , acetic acid was also
observed as an abundant product. The high concentration of this
acid made it easily quantified by GC, even though the presence of
two O-atoms in a C
2 molecule made the detection by flame ioniza-
tion detection unfavorable. Consumption of the DEE and the forma-
tion of acetic acid from the work of Tran et al. [307] are shown in
Fig. 32 . Their kinetic model, based on the theoretical calculations
from  Sakai  et  al.  [308] ,  predicted  the  experimental  observation
well. The rate analysis revealed that over 90% of the consumption
3 CH(OOH)OC( = O)CH
of  DEE  led  to  KHP,  CH
3 ,  which  decomposed
3 CH(  ̇O)OC( = O)CH
3 and   ̇OH radicals. In the model, the sub-
into CH
sequent reactions of this intermediate followed the analogous re-
action as   ̇OCH
2 OCHO and led to acetic acid. The rate constant of
this reaction is assumed to be identical to that of   ̇OCH
2 OCHO, cal-
culated by Wang et al. [246] . However, the activation energy was
reduced  by  2 kcal/mol,  considering the  difference in  bond  disso-
ciation energies between the primary- and secondary-carbon po-
sitions. The rapid formation of KHP, and its selective reaction to
acetic acid, explains both the very high reactivity of DEE and the
abundant formation of acetic acid at low temperatures (maximum
mole fraction above 2.5 × 10 −3 ). When the temperature increased,
β-scission reactions of the   ̇QOOH radical were more favorable. The
pathway could compete with the channels leading to the KHP, ex-
plaining the particular shape of the NTC zone displayed in Fig. 32 .
The model underestimated the acetic acid formation by a fac-
tor of two to three in the work of Serinyel et al. [169] . The main
reaction pathway for acetic acid is:
C H 3  ̇ C O + O 2 (cid:3) C H 3 C ( =O ) O  ̇ O

C H 3 C ( =O ) O  ̇ O + HO  ̇ O (cid:2) C H 3 C ( =O ) OH + O 2 + . O .

C H 3 C ( =O ) O  ̇ O + CHO  ̇ O (cid:2) C H 3 C ( =O ) OH + O 2 + C H 2 O .

The last two reaction channels are overall reactions, details of
which can be found in Refs. [29 , 40] . The authors mentioned that
underestimation may be partly due to uncertainties in the fate of
3 O  ̇O), as well as missing pathways.
the methylperoxy radicals (CH
Regarding this discussion, the pathway of KHP to acetic acid might
be the missing pathway.

Formic  acid  was  also  observed  as  an  important  intermediate
during the JSR oxidation of dibutylether by Thion et al. [309] . In
their model, formic acid was mainly formed from the addition of
 ̇OH  radical  to  formaldehyde.  The  model  over-predicted  the  mole
fraction  of  formic  acid.  However,  the  authors  deduced  that  this
may have been caused by the over-prediction of formaldehyde in
the model.

4.2.2. Korcek decomposition and the formation of acids

To avoid negative impact on the environment [310] , it is im-
portant to better understand the potential for direct emissions of
monocarboxylic  acids  from  the  combustion  process.  To  this  end,
Battin-Leclerc  et  al.  [311]  proposed  tentative  channels  to  predict
acid  formation  in  combustion  systems,  such  as  the  addition  of
 ̇OH radicals to formaldehyde, leading to formic acid, reactions of

additional  reaction  of  an   ̇OH  radical  to  formaldehyde;  under-
prediction of this acid at a low temperature encouraged the au-
thors to consider other pathways to formic acid.

In 2010, Herbinet et al. studied n -butane oxidation in a JSR by
SVUV-PIMS [238] . The formation of a significant amount of acetic
acid  ( m/z = 60)  was  reported,  with  a  maximum  mole  fraction  of
around 1 × 10 -3 . A large peak of formic acid ( m/z = 46) was also
observed,  but  not  quantified.  Acetic  acid  was  quantified  by  the
same team [108] during the JSR oxidation of propane using both
GC and SVUV-PIMS. For both hydrocarbons, satisfactory agreement
was found between GC and SVUV-PIMS measurements ( Fig. 33 (a)
and (b)). A comparison between the experimental and simulated
mole fractions of acetic acid during the JSR oxidation of linear C
3 ,
C
7 alkanes [108,238,258] is presented in Fig. 33 . Discrepan-
cies observed between the modeled and experimental profiles in
propane and n -butane oxidation are not currently understood.

4 and C

The  Nancy-Hefei  team  also  reported  the  formation  of  acetic
and propanoic acids during the JSR oxidation of isomers of hex-
ane [257] , n- pentane [111] , and n- heptane [258] using GC or SVUV-
PIMS. Quantification of these organic acids in the SVUV-PIMS ex-
periment was achieved by measuring the absolute photoionization
cross-section of acetic acid and propanoic acid, as shown in Fig. 34 .
The  ionization  energy  of  the  acid  is  normally  higher  than  that
of the olefinic hydroperoxide isomer. For example, the ionization
energy of propanoic acid is 10.44 eV, while for allyl hydroperox-
ide it is 9.55 eV [173] . The signal measured for acids may contain
the signal of the olefinic hydroperoxide isomers. The PIE curve for
C
2 measured during n -heptane oxidation [146] is presented in
Fig. 34 . Apart from the ionization energy onset close to propanoic
acid ( ∼ 10.36 eV), the onset of the allyl hydroperoxide isomer is
clearly observed at ∼ 9.45 eV. In the work on n- heptane by Ro-
driguez et al. [186] , the peak at m/z = 74 could correspond to both
propanoic acid and allyl hydroperoxide at 11 eV. However, the max-
imum propanoic acid mole fraction is around 6 × 10 -5 [258] , no-
tably larger than that of allyl hydroperoxide at around 7 × 10 -6
( Fig. 29 ).

trast, carboxylic acids were first found to be significant products

[73 , 82] ; C

Carboxylic acids were also observed during the gas phase oxi-
dation of hydrocarbons. Using FTIR, formic acid was quantified in
1999 by Cernansky’s team during the oxidation of neo -pentane in
a  flow  reactor  [314] .  In  their  model,  the  authors  considered  an

skeleton, e.g. from acetaldehyde to acetic acid [317] . The reaction
starts with H-abstraction of the aldehydic H-atom, O
2 addition to
the radical site, and disproportionation of the obtained peroxy rad-
ical with an HO  ̇O radical. As shown in Fig. 4 , small aldehydes are
common products of alkane oxidation. They can be easily produced
from KHP decomposition. This model [258] satisfactorily predicted
the acid formation in the case of n- heptane oxidation, but deviated
by a factor of ten in the case of propane [108] .

Following  the  hypothesis  of  Korcek  et  al.  [73,82] ,  that  car-
boxylic  acid  can  be  formed  from  γ -KHPs  during  alkane  oxida-
tion, Jalan et al. [316] used high level computational methods to
thoroughly investigate this pathway for the smallest γ -KHP from
propane oxidation. They proposed a mechanism that led to formic
and  acetic  acid  via  a  cyclic  peroxide  isomer  of  the  γ -KHP.  The
work  by  Moshammer  et  al.  [182]  detected  carbonic  acid  during
the low-temperature oxidation of DME, potentially providing ev-
idence for the Korcek decomposition mechanism. Taking into ac-
count the channels proposed by Jalan et al. [316] , Goldsmith et al.

subsequently  [301]  investigated  the  decomposition  of  the  C
KHP theoretically. The potential energy diagram that they calcu-
lated is shown in Fig. 35 (a), and the branching fractions between
the  four  channels  derived  from  master  equation  calculations  are
displayed in Fig. 35 (b). This last figure shows that formic acid is
the main acid product and acid formation is maximum in the early
stages of alkane oxidation around 500 K. The proposed rate expres-
sions at 101.3 kPa in helium for the formation of formic acid and
acetaldehyde ( k

They found that whatever the method, the pathway related to the
Korcek mechanism always had the lowest energy transition state.

Recent kinetic modeling studies have included the Korcek path-
ways  to  carboxylic  acid.  In  a  reexamination  of  their  models  for
alkane  oxidation,  Ranzi  et  al.  [292,315]  included  a  new  reaction

propane, n- butane and n- heptane JSR oxidation. Experimental data (solid symbols

(lines) using the model of Refs. [292 , 315] , include pathway proposed by Jalan et al.
[316] .

As discussed above, acetic acid measured by GC and SVUV-PIMS
were in good agreement during the JSR oxidation of propane and
n -butane.  However,  this  was  not  the  case  for  the  C
6 +  hydrocar-
bons. For example, in the n -heptane JSR oxidation study, the mole
fraction of acetic acid and propanoic acid measured by GC differed
from those measured by SVUV-PIMS [258] . The shapes of the two
profiles  from  GC  and  SVUV-PIMS  were  notably  different,  with  a
sharp peak around 550 K for the GC measurement, indicating pos-
sible decomposition of KHPs in the GC column, or during the trans-
fer line between the reactor and the inlet of GC [153] .

The  presence  of  formic,  acetic,  propanoic,  and  butanoic  acids
was also reported by Wang et al. [146] in their n- heptane JSR ox-
idation study. Evidence for propanoic acid is shown in Fig. 34 (b).
The  formation  of  formic  acid  was  also  detected  by  Eskola  et  al.
[263] using SVUV-PIMS during a study of the photo-initiated ox-
idation of neo -pentane in a flow tube.

Table 7 summarizes literature studies on gas phase oxidation
of fuels, in which carboxylic acids were quantified. Based on these
experiments, several attempts were made to model the formation
of carboxylic acids. Herbinet et al. [258] proposed reactions starting

With these added reactions, the acid mole fraction reported for
7 alkanes [108 , 238 , 258] was
the JSR oxidation of linear C
4 , and C
modeled by Ranzi’s group [292 , 315] . However, the acetic acid in C
3
4  alkanes was still significantly underpredicted – especailly
and C
4  alkane, as shown in Fig. 33 . The good prediction of acetic
for C
acid in C
7 alkane may have been achieved by the much larger rate
constant from estimation.

In the recent n -heptane kinetic model developed by Zhang et al.
[88] , these reactions were included with the same rate constants as
Ranzi et al. [292] . However, the mole fractions of acids measured
during n -heptane JSR oxidation by Herbinet et al. [258] were sig-
nificantly underpredicted. The authors stated that this discrepancy

could have been caused by the too rapid decomposition rate con-
stants  of  ketohydroperoxides  via  –OOH  bond  dissociation.  While
both rate expressions are based on that proposed by Sahetchian
[286] , the global rate constant at 600 K for the decomposition of
all KHP isomers in the model of Zhang et al. [88] is about twice
that used in the Milano n- heptane model [292] . Thus, for a better
evaluation of the Korcek reactions, more kinetic work is needed to
study the dissociation of KHPs. Furthermore, as discussed by Wang
et al. [146] , it is very likely that there are other channels for or-
ganic acid formation during the gas phase oxidation of alkanes.

Thus  far,  Section  4.2.1  has  examined  the  importance  of  car-
boxylic  acids as intermediates during ether  oxidation.  Carboxylic
acids – including non-alkanoic acids – have frequently been quan-
tified during the JSR oxidation of other oxygenated fuels; they are
particularly  important  in  esters  with  a  C
2 +  alkylic  chain,  which
can easily form an alkanoic acid and an alkene by an unimolecu-
lar elimination involving a six-member ring transition state [323] .
This explains the large amounts of formic acid, propanoic acid and
pentanoic acid observed during the JSR oxidation of butyl formate
[318] , propyl acetate [319] , ethyl propanoate [320] , and ethyl pen-
tanoate [321] , respectively. For example, in the case of ethyl pen-
tanoate, the following molecular reaction is involved:
C 2 H 5 OC ( =O ) C 4 H 9 (cid:2) C 4 H 9 C ( =O ) OH + C 2 H 4 .

Furthermore, carboxylic acids were quantified during JSR oxida-
4 aldehydes by SVUV-PIMS [199 , 240 , 253] and

In propanal oxidation studied by Zhang et al. [253] , the tem-
perature  dependence  of  formic  acid  was  also  measured,  with  a
maximum  mole  fraction  around  600 K.  The  experimental  obser-
vation was reasonably predicted by the model developed in this
work;  but  the  authors  did  not  analyze  the  major  reaction  path-
ways  for  formic  acid.  Similarly,  the  mole  fraction  of  acetic  and
butanoic  acids  was  measured  by  Liao  et  al.  in  n -butanal  oxida-
tion [240] . The formation of both acids peaked around 650 K; how-
ever, the reaction kinetics for these acids was not discussed in the
paper.

4.2.3. Dione formation from ketohydroperoxides

As  mentioned  in  Section  2.2 ,  the  Sahetchian  group  reported
the formation of dodecadiones in their low-temperature oxidation
study of n -dodecane in the gas phase [150] . Most isomers are γ -
diones (the dione in which the two carbonyl functions are sepa-
2 – group). γ -diones were also observed during the
rated by a –CH
cool flames of hydrocarbons, such as butanal-3-one from n -butane
and 2,4-pentanedione from n -pentane. These diones are important
intermediates at temperatures below the cool flame zone [324] . A
study by Barusch et al. [324] showed that as much as 10% of the
initial  n -pentane  was  converted  into  γ -diones.  Before  2010,  the
formation  of  organic  compounds  including  two  carbonyl  groups
was not often reported during gas phase oxidation of fuels under
combustion relevant conditions.

In recent work, diones with the same carbon skeleton as the
fuel molecule have been widely detected in JSR oxidation of alka-
nes using SVUV-PIMS [173 , 186 , 257 , 258] or using SPI-MS [173 , 186] .
One  interesting  observation  is  that  species  including  a  carbonyl
and  an  alcohol  function  often  formed  along  with  the  dione  in-
termediates. The presence of γ -diones was also identified by GC–
7 alkanes [257 , 258] ; however, the
MS during the oxidation of C
temperature dependence of their mole fractions differed from the
measurement by SVUV-PIMS [258] . Similar to the observations of
carboxylic acids in the GC measurement (see Section 4.2.2 ), the au-
thors proposed that the additional diones were produced from de-
composition of KHP in the GC column and/or during the transfer
line between the reactor and the inlet of GC. Table 8 summarizes
the studies in the literature of fuel oxidation in the gas phase, in
which diones were quantified, or their signals as a function of tem-
perature were measured.

6 –C

The observation of diones (i.e., C

7 -diones) during n -heptane ox-
idation by the Nancy-Hefei team was further confirmed by Wang
et al. [146] in their JSR oxidation study of n -heptane using SVUV-
PIMS and APCI-OPMS. These authors also reported intermediates
2  ( n = 2–6), which may
with the molecular formula of C n H
potentially be interpreted as C

2 n −2 O
6 diones.

2 –C

Eskola et al. reported the formation of 2,2-dimethylpropanedial
that was identified by SVUV-PIMS during their study of the photo-
initiated  oxidation  of  neo -pentane  in  a  flow  tube  [263] .  Unfor-
tunately,  they  were  unable  to  provide  quantitative  information.
The substantial formation of diones was reflected by its high sig-
nal  intensity.  For  example,  signal  intensities  of  the  diones  with
the  same  carbon  skeleton  as  the  fuel  are  the  same  order  of
magnitude  as  those  of  cyclic  ethers,  one  of  the  major  prod-
ucts  during  alkane  JSR  oxidation  [146 , 173 , 186 , 257 , 258] .  This  can
be  seen  in  Fig.  4  in  Ref.  [146] ,  where  the  signal  intensities  of
cyclic  ethers  (C
2 )  at  600 K  are  very
similar.

These similar concentrations were also observed during JSR ox-
5 -
idation of n- pentane [173] . The measured mole fractions of the C
diones are on the order of 1.5 × 10 −4 at an equivalence ratio of 0.5
( Fig. 37 (a)), close to that of cyclic ethers under the same condi-
tions ( Fig. 4 ). In the quantification of diones, their photoionization
cross-sections  were  estimated  from  the  group  additivity  method
proposed by Bobeldijk et al. [201] . The uncertainty for the dione

et al. [199] quantified formic and acetic acids, as shown in Fig. 36 .
Simulations  using  the  model  of  the  authors  [199]  predicted
the  observed  amounts  of  acetic  acid  well,  but  not  the  temper-
ature  where  the  maximum  mole  fraction  occurred.  The  kinetic
model showed some reactions that may also explain acid forma-
tion  during  alkane  oxidation.  For  example,  acetic  acid  was  pro-
duced from ketene (CH
2 CO), also a potential product of KHP de-
composition during alkane oxidation. The   ̇OH radical addition to
2 C( = O)OH radical; and the subsequent reac-
ketene formed a   ̇CH
3 C( = O)OH. In formic
tion of this radical with HO  ̇O radical led to CH
acid ( Fig. 36 ), its formation was not satisfactorily predicted. Anal-
ysis showed that formic acid was produced from the   ̇OH radical
addition to formaldehyde, and then a C –H β-scission.

The formation of diones was also reported during the gas phase
oxidation  of  oxygenated  fuels.  The  dione  with  the  same  carbon
skeleton as the fuel molecule was identified by SVUV-PIMS during
the oxidation study of DME [157] , DEE [307] , and 1,2-DME [264] .

compound were very good ( Fig. 32 ). According to the model [307] ,
acetic  anhydride resulted from the KHP via the H-abstraction of
the C –H adjacent to the –OOH group and a subsequent β-O –O scis-
sion.

3 C( = O)OC( = O)CH

The production of diones was also reported during the oxida-
tion  of  a  cyclic  ether,  tetrahydrofuran.  The  formation  of  butane-
dial was observed by Vanhove et al. [325] from rapid compression
machine experiments using GC, and by Antonov et al. [262] , from
photo-initiated oxidation in a flow tube by SVUV-PIMS.

Since  the  experimental  observation  of  diones  in  2010  [238] ,
effort s  have  been  made  in  both  kinetic  modeling  and  the-
oretical  calculations  to  explore  their  formation  pathways.
Figure  38  summarizes  the  up-to-date  channels  proposed  in  the
literature.

In  a  first-proposed  pathway  [154] ,  the  β-C –H  scission  of
the  ketoalkoxy  radical  leads  to  diones;  the  ketoalkoxy  radical  is
derived from the KHP by breaking the O –OH bond.  However, in
modeling n -heptane oxidation [258] , these authors found that this
channel  (Ea  ≈ 81 kJ/mol)  cannot  compete  with  the  β-C –C  scis-
sion (Ea ≈ 65 kJ/mol) of the ketoalkoxy radical. Afterward, another
channel was postulated, i.e., the molecular decomposition of KHP
to produce water and diones. However, even with this additional
reaction,  the  experimental  formation  of  diones  was  significantly
underpredicted.

Later,  Ranzi  et  al.  [292 , 315]  included  a  new  reaction  class
in  their  updated  modeling  of  alkane  oxidation,  in  which  H-
abstractions from KHP led directly to a dione, an   ̇OH radical, and
H
2 O.  The  dione  mole  fraction  obtained  during  the  JSR  oxidation
of propane, n -butane and n -heptane [108 , 238 , 258] was predicted;
however,  apart  from  the  under-prediction  of  mole  fraction,  the
temperature dependence of the dione mole fraction in propane ox-
idation was not reproduced well ( Fig. 33 ). This deviation can also
be seen in Fig. 37 a, which displays dione profiles computed dur-
ing  n- pentane  JSR  oxidation  by  the  model  of  Bugler  et  al.  [111] .
In  this  model,  the  new  reaction  class  proposed  by  Ranzi  et  al.
[292 , 315] was considered. The predicted temperature correspond-
ing to the maximum formation of dione was about 40 K lower than
the experimental measurement ( Fig. 37 a). This work showed that
the most recent models in the literature still do not satisfactorily
predict dione formation. Some ambiguous issues must be resolved

mole fraction is expected to be lower than for the hydroperoxides
( Section 3.2 ), because the group’s contributions could all be esti-
mated from the analysis of standard species. However, the model
could not predict their temperature dependence of formation and
mole fractions.

The formation of diones also depends on the structure of the
fuel. For example, the JSR oxidation study of the five isomers of
hexane [257] showed that the branching level of the fuel molecule
significantly impacted the formation of C
6 -diones, which have the
same carbon skeleton as the fuel. The linear isomer produced al-
most an order of magnitude more diones than the dimethyl iso-
mers, assuming that these diones have close photoionization cross-
sections [ Fig. 37 (b)].

been proposed, reaction kinetics studies in the literature are very
scarce. In this section, the few studies related to the third O
2 addi-
tion reactions are discussed, such as the alternative isomerization
of the   ̇OOQOOH radical, model development for the third O
2 reac-
tions and their effect on IDT and combustion phasing.

4.3.1. Alternative isomerization of the   ̇OOQOOH radical

As shown in Section 3.2.5 , the third O

2  addition in fuel low-
temperature  oxidation  leads  to  highly  oxygenated  intermediates
with four and five oxygen atoms added to the fuel molecule. The
prerequisite of this reaction mechanism is alternative isomerization
of   ̇OOQOOH radicals. The reaction kinetics of this type of reaction
has  been  investigated  in  recent  years.  Sharma  et  al.  [104]  stud-
ied  the  thermochemistry  and  rate  constants  of  several  selected
 ̇OOQOOH radicals; special attention was paid to the hindered ro-
tors of molecules with multiple internal rotors. Rate constants for
the standard isomerization of   ̇OOQOOH to KHP were obtained and
used in up-to-date Galway models [88 , 109 , 291] . For alternative iso-
merization pathways, the rate constants were not computed. In-
stead,  they  calculated  the  rate  constants  of  RO  ̇O  isomerizations,
which  could  be  used  to  estimate  alternative  isomerization  rate
constants. They mentioned that for some   ̇OOQOOH radicals, alter-
native isomerization is more important than standard isomeriza-
tion. Two examples of the   ̇OOQOOH radicals, whose alternative iso-
merization is more important than the standard isomerization, are
shown in Fig. 23 .

Miyoshi et al. [105] carried out a comprehensive kinetic anal-
ysis of various kinds of   ̇OOQOOH radicals and suggested that the
alternative isomerization rate constants of   ̇OOQOOH could be re-
ferred to analogous RO  ̇O radicals. The importance of the alternative
isomerization was also highlighted by Goldsmith et  al.  [300] for
 ̇OOQOOH radical in propane oxidation and by Sun et al. [327] for
 ̇OOQOOH  radical  in  neo -pentane  oxidation.  Recently,  Yao  et  al.
[328]  studied  site-specific  rate  constants  of  some   ̇OOQOOH  rad-
icals;  their  study  suggested  that  referring  to  the  analogous  RO  ̇O
radicals may underestimate the alternative isomerization rate con-
stants of   ̇OOQOOH radicals. Mohamed et al. [329 , 330] systemically
studied  standard  isomerizations  and  alternative  isomerization  of
 ̇OOQOQH radicals in n -butane and iso -butane oxidation. The com-
petitive relationship of these two reactions and the feasibility of
referring to RO  ̇O radicals to obtain the rate constants of   ̇OOQOOH
alternative isomerization were discussed. Their results showed that
the rate constant of   ̇OOQOOH alternative isomerization reactions
are generally in good agreement with analogous RO  ̇O isomerization
rates. The analogy is feasible for a few cases of   ̇OOQOOH alterna-
tive isomerization reactions; however, discrepancies were observed
in some other cases. Similarly, Xing et al. [331 , 332] investigated the
competitive relationship of a class of representative   ̇OOQOOH radi-
cals which undergo the standard isomerization and alternative iso-
merization via the most favorable isomerization pathways by the
six-member ring transition state. They concluded that torsional an-
harmonicity plays a significant role in the competition between the
two isomerization pathways; and the size of the effect depends on
the structure of the alkyl group, e.g. for   ̇OOQOOH radical like 3-
peroxy-1-hexyl hydroperoxide and 3-peroxy-5-methyl-1-hexyl hy-
droperoxide, standard isomerization are the minor reactions over
the investigated temperature range of 298 −1500 K, and alternative
isomerization reactions always dominate.

Supported  by  theoretical  calculation,  the  alternative  isomer-
ization pathways of   ̇OOQOOH to   ̇P(OOH)
2  radicals were included
in the kinetic models of n -pentane [109 , 111] , n -hexane [291] , n -
heptane  [88] ,  and  cyclohexane  [333] .  Rate  constants  for  the  al-
ternative isomerization pathways in the three n -alkanes oxidation
models were estimated by referring to analogous RO  ̇O isomeriza-
tion rates [104] . In these models, the subsequent reactions of the
 ̇P(OOH)
2  radical  included  cyclization  to  form  hydroperoxy  cyclic

for the existing models to correctly predict the dione formation.
Xing  et  al.  [268]  performed  theoretical  calculations  of  these  H-
abstractions from KHP in n -pentane oxidation, but they did not in-
volve a comprehensive study on the modeling. In addition to the
reaction channels mentioned above, two other channels have yet
to be tested in combustion chemistry modeling:

• the decomposition of KHP to produce water and dione through
a roaming reaction, proposed by West and Goldsmith [326] ,

• a chemically activated   ̇QOOH + O

2 reaction in parallel with the

formation of KHP, suggested by Eskola et al. [263] .

In summary, the findings in Section 4.2 demonstrated that the
degradation of KHPs does not occur only through cycle 2 of Fig. 1 ,
via  a  rapid  decomposition  to  yield  ketoalkoxy  and   ̇OH  radicals.
Even  all  the  related  channels  are  not  yet  fully  understood;  KHP
decomposition  can  also  be  a  source  of  C
2  carboxylic  acids
( Section 4.2.2 ). The Korcek mechanism described in Fig. 35 is a po-
tential source for carboxylic acids. The competitive relationship be-
tween the KHP dissociation to   ̇OH radicals and the Korcek reaction
of KHP must be thoroughly studied; however, there could be some
additional channels that have not yet been identified.

1 –C

Furthermore, diones with the same carbon skeleton as the fuel
are  important  products  of  hydrocarbon  oxidation  ( Fig.  37 a).  The
pathways envisaged for dione formation are reviewed; and even
though it is strongly suggested that diones come from the path-
ways following KHP consumption, the mechanism involved is still
not well demonstrated and must be more thoroughly explored.

4.3. Kinetic modeling of third O 2 addition reactions

Another interesting topic is reaction kinetics for the third O

addition  reactions.  Because  these  pathways  have  only  recently

mate the thermodynamic properties of these species [290] .

A similar methodology was used to complete the reaction ki-
netic model of n -hexane low-temperature oxidation, recently up-
dated by Wang et al. [334] . In the update, 70 species and 151 re-
actions were added after including the third O
2 reactions in the n -
hexane kinetic model, which originally had 1118 species and 4808
reactions;  these  numbers  are  expected  to  increase  greatly  when
the represented fuel molecules in jet and diesel fuels are consid-
ered.

The  effect  of  the  third  O

2  addition  reactions  on  the  IDTs  of
n -hexane and combustion phasing in HCCI n -hexane combustion
was also investigated [334] . Figure 40 (a) presents the IDTs of n -

ditions. This discrepancy was reduced when the third O
2 addition
reaction pathways were included in the model (represented by the
black line in Fig. 40 (a)). Results  also revealed that promotion of
2  addition  reactions  depends  on  temperature,
IDT  by  the  third  O
which determines the equilibrium of the third O
2  addition path-
way. High temperature (the temperature under the aforementioned
2 addition and resulted
shock tube conditions) inhibited the third O
in a negligible effect on the IDT.

A further study by Wang et al. [334] explored the effect of the
third O
2 addition reactions on the combustion phasing in n -hexane
HCCI combustion. The input parameters for the simulations were
intake pressure 101.3 kPa, temperature 336 K, and equivalence ra-
tio 0.4. The temperature profile as a function of crank angle in the
cylinder (one crank angle degree corresponds to a time delay of
0.1 ms) is presented in Fig. 40 (b). The grey line is the simulation

4.3.3. Implication for the modeling of real world systems

2  addition to   ̇P(OOH)

The  simulation  displayed  in  Fig.  40  shows  that  the  third  O
2
addition reactions promoted the ignition process in both constant
volume and compression ignition of HCCI. Therefore, the question
is how the third O
2 addition reaction promoted the ignition pro-
cess. The brute force sensitivity analysis by Wang et al. [334] shows
that the O
2  radicals and the decomposition
5  intermediates (e.g., KDHP) have a significant effect on
of the O
the ignition of n -hexane. Later, Tingas et al. [335] used the compu-
tational singular perturbation (CSP) approach to explore the reac-
tion dynamics of n -hexane ignition. In their work, two models of
n -hexane, with and without the third O
2 addition reaction mecha-
nism [291 , 334] , were adopted to simulate the ignition behavior of
n -hexane under constant volume (closed batch reactor model) and
variable volume (adiabatic single-zone HCCI engine model).

In the constant volume, the IDT of n -hexane at initial pressure
of 6.08 MPa, initial temperature of 600 K, and equivalence ratio of
1.0 was simulated. Only the first stage ignition was observed in this
simulation. Figure 41 a presents the evolution of the fast explosive
time scale τ
i in the two n -hexane models. In the context of CSP,
the time scale of a mode sets the time frame of the action in this
particular mode. As such, the characteristic mode has a time scale
which will be among the fastest of the slow time scales. In au-
toignition systems, the fast explosive time scale τ
i is typically the
characteristic time scale, characterizing the dynamics of the entire
system [336] . Therefore, the fast explosive time scale is directly re-
lated to the ignition delay time (IDT) and the reactions compos-
ing the fast explosive time scale have a significant effect on the

To thoroughly explore the role of each elementary reaction in
the explosive stage, the three points of the ignition process, P1, P2
and P3 in Fig. 41 , were selected. The first point, P1, is at t = 0 s, cor-
responding to radical species production at the initial stage. P2 and
P3 are at t/ 3 and 2 t/ 3, respectively; they are the times when the
growth of the radical pool is in its exponential phase. The quantifi-

cation contribution of the reaction groups (first O

analyzed. The results revealed that the following three types of re-
actions (only included in the n -hexane model with the third O

addition pathways), contribute to radical chain branching and pro-
mote the explosive nature of n -hexane ignition.

Among them, the decomposition of KDHP is the dominant reac-
tion in decreasing the IDT. A similar conclusion was obtained dur-
ing the ignition process under HCCI conditions, which resulted in
two-stage ignition of n -hexane. However, the role of the third O
2
addition reaction in this process decayed with time and the pro-
motion of IDT became negligible at the end of the first stage igni-
tion.

The kinetic modeling and CSP analysis showed that the afore-

have allowed for the detection of these highly oxygenated species.
Furthermore, strategies for quantitative measurements are lacking,
significantly hampering progress. On the theoretical side, progress
toward a complete understanding of the intermediates involved in
this newly detected reaction scheme is precluded because the size
of the molecular structures, containing a large number of heavy
atoms (C  and O), increase computing time  while simultaneously
lowering the accuracy of the calculations [338] .

5. Conclusion and perspectives

In  this  section,  major  conclusions  from  the  recent  develop-
ment of experimental methods and progress in understanding hy-
droperoxide  chemistry  are  summarized.  Perspectives  concerning
hydroperoxide  studies  in  combustion  and  atmospheric  environ-
ment are also discussed.

5.1. Development of transformative experimental methods

The results presented in this paper have developed mainly from
studies of the low-temperature fuel oxidation in a JSR, which was
coupled  to  two  types  of  analytical  diagnostics,  i.e.,  continuous-
wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy ( cw -CRDS) and photoioniza-
tion mass-spectroscopy (PI-MS). The advantages and disadvantages
of  these  two  diagnostics  for  the  analysis  of  hydroperoxides  and
other intermediates are presented in Table 10 .

2 O

As can be seen from this summary and the discussion in this
review, CRDS has been established as a sensitive technique to de-
2 and other labile species such as HO  ̇O radicals in combus-
tect H
tion studies. In this method, the spectroscopic data of the target
intermediate  must  be  known  in  advance  and  interferences  from
other  intermediates  considered,  limiting  this  technique  to  small
molecules  and  radicals.  Furthermore,  due  to  condensation  prob-
lems in the low-pressure spectroscopic cell at ambient tempera-
ture,  currently  the  method is also  limited in the analysis of  the
intermediates in the JSR oxidation of heavy fuels, i.e., only up to n -
heptane and hexanal ( Section 3.2.1 ). However, the range of species
probed by CRDS can certainly be enlarged. For example, the ab-
solute cross-section of HONO, a potentially important intermediate
in fuel oxidation in the presence of NO x  [339] , was measured by
CRDS in the near-infrared region [214] .

Mass spectrometry techniques allow detection of intermediates
without prior knowledge of their identity, permitting detection of
large and/or complex species. Condensation is normally not a prob-
lem, especially using molecular-beam sampling. Using this method,
JSR oxidation studies for fuels up to methyl decanoate have been
reported. The SVUV-PIMS method has already been used to probe
the product from the thermal degradation of notably heavier fuels,
such as biomass pyrolysis [340–342] . JSR sampling molecular-beam
mass spectrometry has also been used to investigate the ozonolysis
process of biogenic emissions [48] that produces complex species
within the pool of oxygenated intermediates [62] .

cw -CRDS and mass spectrometry benefit from probe sampling
(e.g., molecular beam and sonic probe), enabling sufficient cooling
of the reactants and intermediates. Unfortunately, both techniques
currently exhibit limitations when exploring the structures of more
complex intermediates.

Operating  conditions  using  these  two  diagnostic  techniques
could  be  expanded.  At  present,  all  the  JSR  oxidation  studies  us-
ing CRDS or photoionization mass-spectrometry have been carried
out at around 100 kPa; these methods must be adapted to study
the reaction process at pressures more relevant to engine combus-
tion [338] (up to 6 MPa for diesel engines [86] , up to 12 MPa for
HCCI engines [85] ). A JSR with a sampling probe has already been
used  at  pressures  up  to  4 MPa  [166] ,  together  with  the  conven-
tional analytical methods of GC and FTIR. One perspective could

generated  additional  radical  chain-branching  intermediates  of
KDHP.  The  bond  dissociation  of  the  –OOH  groups  of  KDHP  pro-
duced  extra   ̇OH  radicals  that  may  have  extended  ignition  limits
in certain combustion environments. This newly explored third O
2
addition reaction may advance the ignition process at high pres-
sures and offer better prediction of the IDT of long chain alkanes
[337] .

To  summarize  Section  4.3 ,  it  is  now  well-accepted  that
 ̇OOQOOH radicals not only lead to KHP but can also isomerize to a
wide range of   ̇P(OOH)
2 radicals. Such alternative isomerization can
be important, especially when yielding tertiary radicals ( Fig. 23 ).
These   ̇P(OOH)
2 addition re-
2 radicals are candidates for a third O
action  and  are  a  source  of  compounds  with  four  or  five  oxygen
atoms added to the same skeleton as the fuel molecule ( Fig. 26 ).
This section shows that these pathways, postulated to follow the
2  addition in an oxidation model, changed the prediction
third O
of  IDTs  in  RCM  or  in  an  HCCI  engine.  However,  kinetic  data  for
these reactions is still very scarce. More thorough studies for reac-
tion kinetics of the typical structure of intermediates are needed.
More  investigations  are  needed  to  better  understand  the  condi-
tions in which this refinement may be fully necessary, consider-
ation of these new pathways will involve significant enlargement
of the models.

Mapping the initial conditions that revealed the effect of third
O
2  addition reactions on the IDT was performed by Wang et al.
[174] using the modeling of n -heptane as a prototype. Results from
Fig. 42 reveal that (i) the effect of third O
2 addition pathways on
the  IDT  was  more  evident  at  lower  temperatures;  (ii)  the  effect
of third O
2  addition pathways on the IDT was more apparent at
higher pressures; and correspondingly, the ratio of KDHP to KHP
species was higher at higher pressures. For example, a reduction
of about 20% in the ignition delay time was noted at 100 kPa, and
60%  at  5 MPa,  at  a  temperature  of  600 K  [174] .  Additional  simu-
lations showed that the third O
2  addition reaction had a greater
effect on the IDT under fuel-lean conditions than under fuel-rich
conditions. Similar conclusions were also obtained by Tingas et al.
[335] .

Moreover,  the  desired  kinetic  studies  are  hampered  by  the
difficulty  in  detecting  these  elusive  intermediates.  So  far,  only
molecular-beam  mass  spectrometry  experiments  with  soft  ion-
ization through synchrotron-generated vacuum-ultraviolet photons

Limitations/Difficulties

Due to condensation/adsorption problems, CRDS are not fully

adapted to analyze intermediates for large fuel (e.g.,
n -decane) oxidation.
Mirror cleaning frequently required, especially for
combustion experiments.

For species with known photoionization cross-sections,
uncertainties of ∼25% are typical and are larger when
ionization cross-sections are calculated or estimated.

Extensive calibration of the mass spectrometer is necessary
(MDFs, etc.). Furthermore, photoionization cross-sections
need to be known.

A simple mass spectrum can be accumulated in about two
minutes with sufficient signal to noise (S/N) ratio. Several
mass spectra at different photon energies are necessary at
any given temperature for a complete analysis.

Species identification and quantification nearly impossible for
large molecules. Interpretation of mass spectra becomes
complex.

be the coupling of high pressure JSRs (for example up to 1 MPa),
using  cw -CRDS  cell,  or  with  PIMS.  A  high  pressure  flow  reactor,
working at pressures up to 200 kPa, has already been coupled to a
molecular-beam mass spectrometer [158] . Sampling was achieved
with an orifice positioned at the center of the end wall of the re-
actor. A solution by which to sample the reactor at atmospheric
pressure could be the use of a sampling cone, proven to work for
atmospheric pressure sampling, and challenging at high pressure
for two main reasons. 1) The cone, usually made of fused silica to
avoid wall reactions, should resist the large difference in pressure
( (cid:5)P ≈ 1.1 MPa for a 1 MPa inside the reactor). The use of a cone
made of metal (and preferably coated with non-reactive materials),
could overcome this problem, but wall reactions may still occur.
The use of a thick-fused silica cone would be preferable, if possible.
2) The difference in pressure between the reactor and the analyt-
ical device should be preserved. One solution would be to control
the size of the hole at the tip of the sampling cone; this may not
be a universal solution since sampling cone holes are usually hand
made.  Laser  or  ultrasonic  drilling  can  help  solve  this  issue.  For
the PIMS, another solution would be faster pumping between the
sampling cone and the skimmer, an additional stage between the
sampling cone and the skimmer. For cw -CRDS, the use of a fused
silica capillary tube is an option. However, this solution does not
work for the sampling of reactive species like radicals.

While current techniques to detect and identify hydroperoxide
species in complex environments have been proven to be very suc-
cessful, some limitations remain:

• Small Franck-Condon overlaps may preclude the sensitive de-

tection of some important intermediates;

• Species, and specifically isomeric identification based on the PIE
curve, appear to be unreliable and/or achievable without theo-
retical support, which can be difficult when the size of the fuel
molecule increases;

• Dissociative  ionization  might  preclude  a  complete  qualita-
tive/quantitative interpretation of the sampled mass spectra;
• Access to synchrotron radiation facilities is highly competitive

and therefore limited.

To  overcome  some  of  these  challenges,  new  diagnostic  tech-
niques  that  address  at  least  one  of  the  above  issues,  must  be
developed.

For  example,  photoelectron-photoion-coincidence  (PEPICO)
mass spectrometry might become a useful tool for the advanced
diagnostics  of  hydroperoxides  in  low-temperature  oxidation  en-
vironments [343 , 344] . In this technique, which also relies on the
soft  ionization,  not  only  the  photoion  is  detected  (as  in  regular
mass  spectrometry),  but  the  ejected  photoelectron  is  also  de-
tected in coincidence. The energy of the ejected electron and the
related  photoelectron  spectra  can  be  used  for  isomer-resolved
detection. While it is possible to perform PEPICO experiments in
the laboratory using lasers, two VUV beamlines at SOLEIL, France
and  PSI,  Switzerland  mastered  this  technique  and  offer  a  great
advantage in photon flux and duty cycle compared to laboratory
experiments  [191 , 192 , 345] .  Flame-sampling  experiments  have
proven that PEPICO can be used as an isomer-resolving diagnostic
technique for complex environments [191–195 , 346 , 347] . An exam-
ple is shown in Fig. 43 , in which Pieper et al. [195] used PEPICO
to  identify  the  isomers  at  m/z = 68  from  a  fuel-rich  iso -pentane
flame. It shows how the two-dimensional image of the electrons
that  correlate  to  m/z = 68  ions  ( Fig.  43 a)  is  converted  into  the
photoelectron spectra ( Fig. 43 b) and how this is fitted to reference
spectra  of  the  four  m/z = 68  isomers  1,3-pentadiene,  isoprene,
cyclopentene, and 1,4-pentadiene.

The photoelectron spectra are likely to be unknown for the hy-
droperoxides examined in this review. For identification purposes
with PEPICO, and as with SVUV-PIMS, results must be combined
with theoretical calculations of the ionization and binding energies.
Non-synchrotron-based  mass-spectrometric  diagnostic  tech-
niques already implemented in the laboratories include laser-based
techniques  with  four-wave  mixing  and  atmospheric-pressure

used to identify functional groups [25] . These advanced diagnostic
techniques typically come with a high resolution mass spectrom-
eter  that  allows  exact  determination  of  the  molecular  formula.
However, issues remain concerning the quantification of the signal,
i.e., the conversion of the mass spectra into mole fraction profiles.
A more advanced diagnostic technique, called tandem or two-
dimensional mass spectrometry , deserves to be tested for the study
of  the  peroxide  chemistry.  This  technique  should  chiefly  offer
the  possibility  of  clarifying  the  chemical  structure  of  sampled
molecules [349 , 350] . In this technique, currently being developed
for  flame-sampling  experiments  [196] ,  ions  are  created  using  a
soft ionization technique and mass is selected using a quadrupole
mass filter. These mass-selected ions are fragmented in a process
called  collision-induced  fragmentation  [351 , 352] .  The  created  frag-
ment ions are then mass selected with a second mass spectrom-
eter;  the  observed  fragmentation  pattern  is  expected  to  provide
structural information, possibly overcoming the challenges in iden-
tifying molecular structures using current experimental techniques
[349 , 350] .

Although  the  fragmentation  pattern  of  the  hydroperoxide
species might be useful when identifying molecular structures, in
a totally different approach, rotational spectroscopy might be devel-
oped into a tool that enables unique identification capabilities. Ro-
tational spectroscopy, also known as microwave spectroscopy , mea-
sures the frequency of the transitions between rotational states of
freely rotating, polar molecules in the gas phase [353] . Microwave
spectroscopy  is  known  to  provide  the  most  accurate  molecular
structures;  it  is  not  only  sensitive  to  isomeric,  but  also  to  con-
formeric structures [353 , 354] ; and it is based on the fact that the
quantized rotational states of individual molecules depend on the
moment of inertia, and therefore, the molecular structure. The in-
vention of chirped-pulse microwave spectroscopy, in particular, has
overcome some inherent problems, such as narrow band resonator
style experiments that precluded easy detection of overview spec-
tra and quantification [355] .

Worldwide  effort s  are  being  undert aken  to  est ablish  chirped-
pulse  microwave  spectroscopy  as  an  analytical  tool  in  physical
chemistry problems [354 , 356 , 357] . Microwave spectroscopy is typ-
ically conducted in pulsed molecular-beam experiments that result
in rotational temperatures in the molecular beam of less than 5 K.
Such rotationally cold molecules are needed to increase the sensi-
tivity of this technique, which is dependent on the population dif-
ferences between the different rotational states. This might hamper
the technique for applicability in the study of peroxide chemistry
in complex environments, but Hansen et al. [358] recently showed
that low rotational temperatures can be achieved after sampling
from hot flame environments, allowing the detection of oxygenated
species in laboratory flames. Their experimental set-up, and a typi-
cal rotational spectrum after flame-sampling, are shown in Fig. 44 .
The challenges arising with the interpretation of the microwave
spectra  from  complex  gas  mixtures  are  complementary  to  those
discussed  above,  which  govern  interpretation  of  the  mass  spec-
tra. While mass spectrometry typically allows only for identifica-
tion of mass-to-charge ratios, without providing detailed structural
information, microwave spectroscopy has the potential to provide
highly detailed structural information. Challenges may arise from
assigning spectroscopic features to unknown chemical structures,
from  the  complexity  of  the  rotational  spectra  due  to  additional
interactions of the rotational momentum with nuclear and elec-
tronic spins, and from different conformeric states of large flexible
molecules. Furthermore, frequency ranges of the microwave com-
ponents are limited, resulting in restrictions to accessible rotational
transitions for targeted species in the given frequency range.

to  be  underestimated  by  a  large  factor,  due  to  the  disregard  of
significant fragmentation of this species. For these hydroperoxides

are  alkenyl  and  small  alkyl  hydroperoxides),  while  the  hydrogen
peroxide  peaks  at  the  highest  temperature.  The  maximum  mole
fraction  of  acetic  acid  was  observed  at  temperatures  about  15 K
lower than that of pentadiones.

In  comparison  to  Fig.  1 ,  Fig.  46  shows  the  significant  im-
provement in understanding reaction pathways during alkane low-
temperature oxidation since 2010. This low-temperature oxidation
mechanism is also important in microgravity cool flame formation
of fuel droplets [232 , 359] and in the oxidative stability of lubri-
cants and other industrial fluids [80] .

The  improvements  include  several  aspects.  First,  in  addition
to  the  formation  of  the  many  normal  oxidation  products  (cyclic
ethers, aldehydes, and ketones), two new types of intermediates
must be considered: carboxylic acids (e.g., C
2 ) and diones with
two  carbonyl  groups.  As  shown  in  Fig.  45 ,  these  products  are
formed in impressive amounts.

Second, alkyl and ketohydroperoxides are not the only organic
hydroperoxides  that  must  be  considered.  As  previously  demon-
strated,  pathways  leading  to  olefinic  hydroperoxides  (OHP  in
Fig. 46 ) should also be taken into account.

Last, is a third propagating cycle (cycle 3 in Fig. 46 ) that in-
cludes a branching channel derived from a third O
2 addition path-
way  which  has  been  proven  feasible.  This  pathway  is  a  source
of hydroperoxides, with five O-atoms added to the fuel molecule,
such as ketodihydroperoxides (KDHP). A slight promotion of IDTs
by  this  new  cycle  has  been  reported  at  low  temperatures.  The
third O
2 addition pathway is also a potential source of hydroper-
oxides  with  four  O-atoms  added  to  the  fuel  molecule,  such  as
olefinic dihydroperoxides (ODHP), or di-ketohydroperoxides (DKHP,
not shown in Fig. 46 ). For these newly proposed reaction pathways,
more kinetic investigations are necessary to fully identify the in-
volved channels and their rate parameters – necessary for the eval-
uation of their roles in the ignition process.

The key reaction that determines the first stage ignition in the
reaction  scheme  is  the  decomposition  of  KHPs.  The  reaction  ki-
netics  related  to  these  intermediates  are  the  basis  for  complete

exploration of the Korcek reaction to organic acids, the dione for-
mation from KHPs, and the importance of the third O
2  addition
pathways on the ignition process. Currently, studies on the reaction
kinetics of hydroperoxides – especially of KHPs – are scarce, both
experimentally and theoretically. From the experimental side, col-
laboration with organic chemists to synthetize the hydroperoxides
(ketohydroperoxides and other hydroperoxides) would aid in the
study of reaction kinetics and the measurement of physical proper-
ties, like photoelectron and photoionization efficiency spectra. This
type of experimentation is challenging because these hydroperox-
ides can violently dissociate. For the theoretical investigation, the
only study in the literature is on the γ -KHP reaction in propane
oxidation [300 , 301] . Considering the complexity of the fuel struc-
tures (linear, branched, cyclic, and oxygenated), the large number
of possible KHP isomers, and the competition of unimolecular and
bimolecular reactions, the systemic and comprehensive investiga-
tion of reaction kinetics of KHPs is certainly necessary. A recent
study by Grambow et al. [322] , showed that the unimolecular reac-
tion pathways of the simplest γ -KHP, 3-hydroperoxypropanal, are
much more complex than expected. The authors discovered 68 re-
actions that were previously unknown and completely unexpected
for this KHP. The importance of these newly discovered reactions
must still be proven.

The proposition of the third O

2 addition pathways creates new
research  avenues  for  autoignition  and  hydroperoxide  chemistry.
The  questions  are  whether  further  O
2  addition  (fourth  and  fifth
2 additions [174] ) could occur; what is the appropriate environ-
O
ment for the further O
2 addition, how can we observe them, and
how would they affect our understanding of autoignition and at-
mospheric chemistry? The highly oxygenated intermediates, with
eleven O-atoms added to the reactant, were observed during the
atmospheric auto-oxidation of aromatics [360] , indicating a fifth O
2

2  addition,  e.g.,  a  fourth  O

addition reaction process. From the analysis of Wang et al. [174] ,
the  prerequisites  for  further  O
2  addi-
tion, are “(i) sufficient length of the carbon backbone, which allows
multiple H-shift of the peroxy radical; (ii) functional groups such
as tertiary C –H, naphthenic C –H, and oxygenated functions (e.g.,
carbonyl, keto, –OOH, –OH) which facilitate alternative isomeriza-
tion; (iii) an adequate concentration of O
2  (e.g., pressure, fuel/O
2
2  addition  reaction  (bimolec-
ratio),  which  affects  the  rate  of  O
ular  reactions)  and  subsequent  competition  with  bond-breaking
via concerted H-transfer/beta-scission, which are favored at higher
pressures and lower fuel/O
2  ratios; and (iv) an appropriate tem-
perature for the oxidation reaction, which affects the equilibrium
of the O
2 addition
2 addition reaction (lower temperature favors O
reactions).”

It is expected that the concentration of hydroperoxide interme-
2  addition is lower than those
diates from the fourth and fifth O
2  addition. To capture these reactive intermedi-
from the third O
ates, it is necessary to increase the detection limit of the SVUV-
PIMS  method.  Furthermore,  the  atmospheric  pressure  chemical

ionization (APCI) mass spectrometer, using nitrate (NO

and acetate (CH
containing –OOH groups and could require a technique to explore
autoignition and hydroperoxide chemistry.

Third O

2 addition pathways are also important for atmospheric
auto-oxidation chemistry. The unburnt hydrocarbons (alkanes, cy-
cloalkanes, and aromatics) and oxygenated compounds (aldehyde,
keto compounds, and organic acids) from internal combustion en-
gines are important sources of pollutants in the urban area [361] .
Their oxidation reaction by   ̇OH radical leads to radical intermedi-
ates; and the O
2 addition to the radical site forms peroxy radicals.
Similar to low-temperature oxidation in combustion environments

(e.g.,  T  >  500 K,  at  which  organic  compounds  start  to  react  by
oxidation  without  photochemical  initiation),  peroxy  radicals  are
also the center for the atmospheric auto-oxidation of organic com-
pounds  [13] .  In  the  ozonolysis,  or  OH-radical-initiated  oxidation
of  unsaturated  hydrocarbons,  peroxy  radicals  undergo  internal
transfer  of  the  weakly  bound  H  atoms  connected  to  the  oxy-
genated functional groups ( –OH and –C = O) and allylic sites, etc.
However, for the peroxy radicals from saturated hydrocarbon auto-
oxidation,  the  bimolecular  reactions  are  usually  more  important
[362 , 363] .

A recent study by Praske et al. revealed that the auto-oxidation
of peroxy radicals from saturated hydrocarbons becomes increas-
ingly  important  in  urban  and  suburban  North  America  [364] .  In
remote areas, as well as urban areas with decreasing NO x  emis-
sion due to the strict regulation from power generation and trans-
portation, peroxy radicals might undergo auto-oxidation pathways
that involve internal hydrogen migration and O
2 addition and pro-
duce hydroperoxide intermediates with multiple functional groups.
This process should be more favorable for organic compounds with
weak C –H bond (tertiary C –H, allylic C –H) and/or oxygenated func-
tions. The higher temperature of summer afternoons and tropical
areas should also favor the auto-oxidation process [364] .

Furthermore, as highlighted in Fig. 47 , it is necessary to estab-
lish an intelligent system of varieties and relative importance of
the products generated by auto-oxidation processes. They might be
emitted  at  the  outlet  of  engines  and  interact  with  species  from
biogenic  sources  to  form  secondary  organic  aerosol  (SOA),  with
significant  implications  for  global  climates  [365] .  This  is  partic-
ularly important for low-volatility organic compounds, like those
containing several oxygen atoms, which can result from hydroper-

oxide or polyhydroperoxide decomposition and can be the start-
ing  nucleus  for  SOA.  Moreover,  extremely  low-volatility  organic
compounds  (ELVOC),  with  a  few  functional  groups  added  to  the
VOC  reactants,  can  be  generated  from  multigeneration  oxidation
of  oxidation  products  and/or  auto-oxidation  of  the  organic  per-
oxy  radical  from  the  initial  VOC  reactant  [365] .  Their  extremely
low vapor pressure could cause them to condense onto the grow-
ing  particles  in  an  irreversible  process.  Another  important  com-
bustion source for organic aerosols is the burning of biomass. An
important fraction of organic compounds from biomass burning is
semi-volatility and intermediate-volatility organic compounds. Un-
derstanding of their emissions and their role in SOA production is
still poor [366 , 367] , and the SOA from biomass burning is not well
constrained in global climate models [368–370] .

To  this  end,  collaborations  from  combustion  and  atmosphere
scientists could bridge the gap. For example, both the SVUV-PIMS
method commonly used in combustion studies and the APCI mass
spectrometer with clustering technique commonly adopted in the
atmospheric  research,  could  be  used  to  investigate  atmospheric
auto-oxidation of hydrocarbons within well-defined laboratory re-
actors (FT and JSR). The combination of these two methods is ex-
pected  to  clarify  the  species  pool  with  a  wide  range  of  volatil-
ity, and improve the identification of their probable structures. The
experience of scientists in combustion and atmospheric chemistry
could be joined to improve detailed kinetic models and predict the
atmospheric  auto-oxidation  process  [371–373] .  The  ultimate  goal
is to develop combustion models that predict fuel ignition, flame
propagation, and pollutant emissions, in cooperation with climate
models that predict the chemical and dynamic evolution of SOA
and global climate forcing.

searcher (Research Director 1st class since 2015) study-
ing detailed kinetic mechanisms to model gas-phase com-
plex reactions, especially the combustion and the low-
temperature oxidation of the components of transporta-
tion  fuels,  including  biofuels.  She  was  an  invited  re-
searcher at AEA Technology, Harwell, UK (1993) and in
N.O.A .A .,  Boulder,  USA  (1997)  to  work  on  atmospheric
chemistry. She is the former head of a team specialized
in Combustion Kinetics from 20 0 0 to 2016. Battin-Leclerc
was awarded an ERC Advanced research grant in 2008
(invited in 2015 by ERC to give a lecture at the Summer Davos “World Economic
Forum”), the CNRS Silver Medal in 2010, as Fellow of the Combustion Institute in
2018. She was the chair of the management committee of COST Action CM0901
gathering 23 countries (2010–2014). She was a co-editor of the book: Cleaner Com-
bustion – Developing Detailed Chemical Kinetic Models, F. Battin-Leclerc, J. Simmie,
E. Blurock Eds., Springer September 2013. Battin-Leclerc served as a technical co-
chair for the 34th International Symposium on Combustion, Warsaw, Poland. She
published over 150 papers in peer-reviewed international journals.
