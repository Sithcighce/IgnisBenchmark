Chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (ClPAHs and BrPAHs; XPAHs) are carcino-
genic organic pollutants which are mainly produced and emitted from combustion processes. In some
environmental matrices, XPAHs display similar toxic properties and even higher toxic equivalent quan-
tities (TEQs) than dioxins. Understanding the sources and formation mechanisms of XPAHs is important
for controlling their emissions and human exposure to these ubiquitous pollutants. Nevertheless, compre-
hensive knowledge on the sources, formation mechanisms, and environmental characteristics of XPAHs,
which are considered as emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is lacking. Here, we review and
discuss the knowledge on the primary sources (i.e. formation mechanisms, levels, composition pattern,
emission factors in combustion and other anthropogenic sources), and secondary formation (i.e. forma-
tion from reactions between emitted PAHs and halogens in environmental compartments). Congener pro-
files of XPAHs released from various anthropogenic sources are evaluated for their possible application as
source tracers of XPAHs. Regarding the chlorination of PAHs, we suggest and discuss two possible mecha-
nisms, which result in the production of different congeners under different processes. Finally, knowledge
on environmental exposure to XPAHs is reviewed. Research needs with regard to formation, emission, an-
alytical methods, environmental exposure and environmental risk assessment are outlined.

1. Introduction

Chlorinated  and  brominated  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons
(ClPAHs and BrPAHs; XPAHs) are halogenated derivatives of poly-
cyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  and  carcinogens  [1,2] .  Due
to differences in ring number, substitution position, and number
of  halogenated  atoms,  there  can  be  a  large  number  of  XPAH
congeners. Structures of some XPAHs with 3–5 rings are shown in
Fig. 1 . Two ring ClPAHs, i.e. polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs),
are included in Annex A and C of the Stockholm Convention on
Persistent  Organic  Pollutants  (POPs),  which  requires  that  their
emission  and  production  must  be  controlled  [3] .  Many  previous
studies reviewed PCN sources [3] therefore, this review focuses on
3–5 ring XPAHs.

XPAHs  (i.e.  3–5  rings;  same  as  below)  can  be  formed  as  by-
products of combustion processes [4–6] , and emitted together with
polychlorinated  dibenzo- p -dioxins  and  dibenzofurans  (PCDD/Fs)
and  PCNs  [7–11] .  They  can  also  be  formed  in  photochemical
reactions [12] . Because of the high toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ),
PCDD/Fs have been regulated, e.g., under directive 2010/75/EU on
industrial emissions, as well as for certain industries, e.g., waste
incineration [13] . In stack gas and fly ash from secondary copper
smelting processes and cement kiln co-processing waste processes,
TEQs of XPAHs are found at same order of magnitude of as TEQs of
PCDD/Fs [14,15] . XPAHs have been identified to be easily formed in
the presence of PAHs and halogens during combustion processes
[4,5,8,16] .  In  fact,  halogens  are  present  as  minor  components  of
all feeding materials [17–20] , and PAHs are found in the exhausts
of  combustion  processes  [21–23] .  Therefore,  even  though  there

is no regulation on the emission of XPAHs, XPAHs should not be
ignored  when  evaluating carcinogenic  risks  of  organic  pollutants
in emitted mixtures.

Currently,  there  are  no  internationally  accepted  toxic  equiva-
lency  factor  (TEF)  values  for  XPAH  congeners.  However,  several
studies  have  evaluated  the  Aryl  hydrocarbon  receptor  (AhR)-
mediated activities of XPAH congeners and reported their relative
BaP )  [15,24]  or  to  2,3,7,8-
potencies  to  benzo[a]pyrene  (BaP)  (REP
tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin  (2,3,7,8-TCDD)  (REP
TCDD )  [25,26] .  The
REP
TCDD  values  of  XPAHs  are  shown  in  Table  1 .  REP
values  of  XPAH  congeners  were  found  to  be  comparable  with
some  penta-chlorinated  naphthalenes  (PeCNs)  and  higher  than
some  tetra-chlorinated  naphthalenes  (TeCNs)  based  on  the  same
cell-based bioassay [27–29] .

BaP  or  REP

Previous studies have reported the vapor pressures of several
XPAHs  [30,31] .  These  studies  show  that  the  vapor  pressures  of
mono- to di- XPAHs range between 10 7 –10 –2 Pa, which are similar
to that of PCDD/Fs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) [30–33] .
For most XPAHs, only estimated values of the other fate-relevant
physicochemical properties, i.e., octanol-water partition coefficients
(K ow ), water solubility and Henry’s law constant are available (Es-
timation Programs Interface Suite  TM ; EPI-Suite  TM ) [34–36] . The
reported  physicochemical  property  parameters  for  XPAHs  are  in
similar  ranges  as  those  of  PCDD/Fs  [37–39]  and  PCBs  [40] .  In
addition, the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of XPAHs were
also  reported  [41] ,  and  results  in  these  studies  suggested  that
XPAHs  can  accumulate  along  food  chains  [42–45] .  Based  on  the
reported physico-chemical of XPAHs, it can be estimated that these
substances  have  the  potential  to  be  re-volatilized  from  surfaces,

transported to remote locations (e.g., Antarctic areas) worldwide,
where PCDD/Fs and PCBs have already been detected [42,46–48] ,
and  accumulate  in  the  vegetation  and  wildlife  in  these  areas.
However, no studies on the long-range transport potential or accu-
mulation of XPAH in the remote abiotic environment or biota exist.
XPAHs are considered as an emerging group of POPs because
of  their  toxicity,  potential  to  undergo  long-range  transport  to
remote  locations  and  bioaccumulation,  and  are  thus  of  concern
because  of  their  potential  adverse  impact  on  human  health  and
the  ecosystem.  XPAHs  can  be  formed  once  there  are  PAHs  and
halogens during industrial processes [4,5,8,16] , or in environmental
compartments from (photo)chemical reactions between PAHs and
halogens [12] . XPAHs are ubiquitous; they have been detected in
many environmental matrices, including air [49,50] , water [51,52] ,
soil [53–55] , and sediment [34,563–58] . Nevertheless, a thorough
assessment  of  their  sources,  formation  mechanisms,  and  occur-
rence in the environment is still lacking. In this review, we provide
a comprehensive perspective on the sources, mechanisms of their
formation during combustion processes, and mechanisms of their
secondary formation (i.e. reactions between PAHs and halogens in
environmental compartments such as atmosphere). We provide a
summary  of  their  concentrations,  composition  profiles,  fate  and
behavior  in  the  environment,  toxicity  and  potential  impacts  on
human and ecosystem health. The review also includes suggestions
on future research directions on these compounds based on the
knowledge and data gaps identified while reviewing the available
research.

2. Analytical methods of XPAHs

There  are  potentially  thousands  of  XPAHs  congeners  in  the
environment, but only dozens have up to date been detected. Most
of the detected XPAHs have 3–5 aromatic rings which are mono-

to tri- chlorinated or brominated. Detection and quantification of
XPAHs  is  difficult,  because  of  the  extremely  low  concentrations
in the abiotic environmental media. No standardized methods for
sampling, extraction and instrument analysis of XPAHs exist.

Sampling methods for other POPs have been applied to XPAHs
[59–61] . For example, the standard procedures (such as EN 1948
and  JIS  K  0311)  for  sampling  stack  gas  emitted  from  stationary
sources for subsequent analyses of POPs, have been modified and
applied for the analysis of XPAHs [61–63] . Polyurethane foam (PUF)
and quartz fiber filters have been used for trapping gaseous and
particulate  phase  XPAHs,  respectively  [49,61] .  These  procedures’
suitability for sampling XPAHs has been evaluated and confirmed
to be effective [61] . Soils, sediments and biota are also sampled
and  pretreated  in  a  similar  manner  as  samples  to  be  analyzed
for POPs. They are subsequently dried (air, oven or freeze dried)
before being extracted [41,53,55] . Soxhlet [7,8,53,55,61] , accelerate
solvent  [58,61]  and  ultrasonic  [49,64]  extractions  with  pure  or
various  mixtures  of  organic  solvents  (hexane,  dichloromethane,
acetone, toluene) have been used for XPAHs in stack gas, ambient
air  (particle  bound  on  filters  and  gaseous  phase  on  PUFs),  sedi-
ment,  soil  and  biota  samples.  XPAHs  in  aqueous  phase  are  first
passed  though  solid  phase  extraction  column,  with  the  XPAHs
enriched on the solid phase followed by subsequent elution of the
XPAHs with organic solvents [65] . Extracts of samples are cleaned
up  on  silica  gel  column  [7,61,66] .  For  some  samples,  activated
carbon cartridge column or gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
column  were  additionally  applied  to  further  clean  the  extract
from  matrix  substances  such  as  lipids,  pigments  or  other  im-
purities  [61,67] .  Deuterated  PAH  standards  were  frequently  used
as  the  internal  standards  for  quantifying  the  XPAHs.  For  exam-
ple,  phenanthrene-d
12  were
spiked to the samples before extraction [68,69] . Jin et al. [61] also
used  13 C
6 -labeled  XPAH  standards  as  the  internal  standards,  i.e.,

Several  instrumental  techniques,  such  as  gas  chromatography
coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC/MS) [14,50] , triple
quadrupole  mass  spectrometry  (GC/MS/MS)  [54] ,  high  resolution
mass  spectrometry  (GC/HRMS)  [61,70,71] ,  and  comprehensive
two  dimensional  gas  chromatography  coupled  with  (high  res-
olution)  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  (GC ×GC/TOF-MS  or
GC ×GC/HRTOF-MS)  [41,72–74] ,  are  the  method  of  choice  for
the  identification  and  qualification  of  XPAHs  in  extracts  from
samples  (industrial,  environmental,  biota).  Targeted  analyses  of
XPAHs was often conducted with GC/MS, GC/MS/MS and GC/HRMS
with  EI  sources.  GC/HRMS  in  selected  ion  mode  (SIM)  is  the
most  widely  applied  method  for  the  quantification  of  XPAHs  in
environmental  samples  because  of  the  high  selectivity  and  high
sensitivity of this instrumental technique [61,70,71] . GC × GC/TOF-
MS  or  GC  × GC/HRTOF-MS  and  Fourier  transform  ion  cyclotron
resonance  mass  spectrometry  have  been  applied  for  non-target
analyses and screening of extracts of soils and biota. The studies
with these methods identified several high halogenated XPAHs in
soil and biota [41,72,74] .

3. Primary sources of XPAHs

3.1. Source categories of XPAHs

3.1.1. Waste combustion, metallurgical processes, and cement
production

As  previously  mentioned,  XPAHs  are  by-products  formed  and
emitted  from  combustion  processes  taking  place  during  many
anthropogenic activities. Industrial processes such as waste incin-
eration  [6,8,75] ,  primary  and  secondary  metallurgical  processing
[7,76] , and cement kiln production co-processing solid wastes pro-
cesses [66] have been identified as substantial sources of XPAHs.
Organic  residues  in  feeding  material,  e.g.,  cable  wrapping,  wire,
polymers, and coal, are the sources of carbon [77–79] . Polyvinyl
chloride  (PVC),  brominated  flame  retardants,  and  printed  circuit
boards  are  sources  of  chlorine  and/or  bromine  [80–83] .  XPAHs
can  form  during  incomplete  combustion,  because  of  insufficient
residence time, oxygen concentration or temperature. XPAHs often
form alongside other POPs, such as PCDD/Fs and PCBs [82,84,85] .

Stack  gas  and  fly  ash  are  important  carriers  of  XPAHs  from
industrial  sources  (see  Table  2 ).  The  highest  concentrations  of
ClPAHs  in  stack  gas  were  reported  by  Ohura  et  al.  [86] ,  based
on  54  waste  incinerators  in  Japan,  and  Wang  et  al.,  based  on
industrial waste incinerators [75] . Highest concentrations of XPAHs
in  fly  ash  samples  were  also  reported  by  Wang  et  al.  [75] .  In
studies  on  industrial  emission  of  XPAHs  over  the  last  5  years,
secondary  copper  smelting  processes  accounted  for  similar  con-
centrations  of  XPAHs  as  waste  incinerators  [61,76] ,  and  cement
kiln co-processing solid waste processes accounted for the lowest
concentrations of XPAHs in fly ash and stack gas among the inves-
tigated  industries.  9-/2-chlorophenanthrene  (9-/2-ClPhe),  1-ClPyr,
and  6-chlorobenz[a]pyrene  (6-ClBaP)  were  the  dominant  con-
geners in studies on waste incinerators and metallurgical smelting
industries [7,8,76,86] . In addition, the TEQs of XPAHs in stack gas
or  fly  ash  were  comparable  to  those  of  PCDD/Fs  from  the  same
industries [7,8,66,76] , highlighting the significant contributions of
XPAHs to total TEQs.

The  magnitude  of  XPAHs  emitted  from  industries,  such  as
metal  and  cement  production,  can  be  related  to  the  production
capacities and flow rates of stack gas. A summary of the emission
factors  and  annual  emissions  amounts  of  XPAHs  from  several
major industrial sectors (i.e., cement kiln co-processing solid waste
industry,  iron  ore  sintering  industry,  secondary  aluminum  and

Fig. 2.  Evaluation of mean emission factors and annually mean emission amounts in several industries in China [7,66,76] . SC: secondary copper smelting industry; CK: cement
kiln co-processing solid waste industry; IS: iron ore sintering industry; SA: secondary aluminum smelting industry; SL: secondary lead smelting industry. (a) Emission factors;
(b) Annual emission amounts. .

secondary  lead  smelting  industries)  of  China  is  shown  in  Fig.  2
[7,66,76] . Emission factors and annual emissions were drived from
XPAH concentrations in the stack gas, flow rate of the stack gas,
production  capacity  of  the  plants,  and  annual  production  of  the
respective industry [7,66,76] . As shown in Fig. 2 , even though the
secondary copper smelting industry accounts for the highest XPAH
concentrations in stack gas, its mean emission factor and annual
emission  amount  are  lower  than  those  of  the  iron  ore  sintering
industry,  which  exhibits  the  highest  emission  factor  and  annual
emission  amount  of  XPAHs  among  the  investigated  industries.
Reasons could be the production capacity of the iron ore sintering
is much  higher than the other industries in China. Furthermore,
even though its mean XPAH emission factor is lowest among the
investigated industries, the annual emission amount of the cement
kiln  co-processing  solid  waste  industry  is  ranked  second  among
the  investigated  industries  in  China  ( Fig.  2 ).  The  reason  is  the
historic  and  even  on  the  global  scale  huge  cement  production
in  China.  With  2.35  billion  tons  of  cement,  China  accounted  for
about 50% of the world production in 2015. In addition, about 93.1
million tons of clinker were produced together with dealing with
waste in 2015 [66,87] . The large contribution of the cement kiln
co-processing solid waste industry to total annual emissions made
it become important in the XPAH emission inventory of China.

3.1.2. Dismantling of e-waste

E-waste  dismantling  is  an  important  source  of  XPAHs  for
surrounding  environment.  More  than  46  million  tons  of  e-waste
were generated worldwide in 2017, and the amount of e-waste is
expected to grow to 52.2 million tons in 2021 [88] . Most e-wastes
are dismantled by using low-tech methods in developing countries
[89–91] . Plastic materials, such as PVC, accounts for about 26% of
the  volume  of  e-wastes  [92–94] ,  while  brominated  flame  retar-
dants are used for the package of e-wastes [93,94] . The methods
for  the  dismantling  and  processing  of  e-waste,  such  as  manual
disassembly, roasting, acid leaching and open burning [14,92] , lead
to the formation of the XPAHs. Ma et al. [14] investigated ClPAH
concentrations  in  environmental  samples  collected  around  an  e-
waste recycling facility and reported higher TEQs for ClPAHs than
for PCDD/Fs in e-waste, leaves, and soil (308 pg TEQ g −1 vs 66.9
pg TEQ g −1 , 361 pg TEQ g −1 vs 147 pg TEQ g −1 , and 92.3 TEQ g −1
vs 70.6 pg TEQ g −1 , respectively). In this study, concentrations of
ClPAHs in soil samples at the e-waste site (26.8 ng g –1 ) were found
to be 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than those in agricultural
soil (ND–0.76 ng g –1 ) [14] . 6-ClBaP was reported to be the dom-
inant  congener  in  workshop  floor  dust  and  surface  soil  samples
from the e-waste recycling facility, whereas 1-ClPyr was the dom-
inant congener in e-waste and leaf samples [14] . Nishimura et al.

[91] also collected soil samples from e-waste open burning areas
in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Ghana, and reported concentra-
tions of total ClPAHs and BrPAHs on the order of 21–2800 ng g –1
and 5.8–520 ng g –1 , respectively, with three ring ClPAHs found to
be dominant, accounting for 53–89% of total ClPAHs.

3.1.3. Automobile emissions

Automobile emissions are another important source of XPAHs.
Haglund et al. [95] detected XPAHs in automobile exhaust samples,
and found that XPAH concentrations in snow samples decreased
with  increasing  distance  of  the  sampling  sites  from  the  road.
Nilsson and Ostman [96] reported higher concentrations of ClPAHs
from road tunnel air samples than from urban area air samples,
strongly  suggesting  the  contribution  of  automobile  emissions  to
the  atmospheric  inventory.  In  these  studies,  halogenated  scav-
engers  (ethylene  dichloride  and  ethylene  dibromide)  in  leaded
gasoline were identified as the major sources of halogens for the
formation of XPAHs. Ishaq et al. [11] also analyzed ClPAHs in air
samples from road tunnels and suggested that the main reason for
the lower ClPAH concentrations in air samples collected in 1996
(3.4 pg m –3 ) as compared to 1991 (29 pg m –3 ) was the decrease
in the use of leaded fuel containing halogenated scavengers [11] .
Even though leaded fuel has been banned in most of the world
since the 21th century, diesel fuel contains Cl in minor amounts
[97–99] .  Furthermore,  the  dispersants,  added  to  retain  dirt  in
suspension, contain Cl, too [97] . This suggests that XPAHs can be
formed together with other POPs in diesel engines. Engine type,
treatment technology and fuel type would affect XPAH emissions
from  the  vehicles  [100,101] .  Road  transport  emissions  have  also
been  identified  as  an  important  source  of  several  halogenated
POPs, such as PCDD/Fs, PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers
(PBDEs) [97,100,102–105] . For example, a study in 2008 in Dalian,
China reported that traffic emissions accounted for 2–19% of total
PCDD/F  emissions  [106] ,  and  a  study  on  sources  of  PBDEs  in
2010 reported that road transport contributes to 28% of the total
combustion  sources  [107] .  For  XPAHs,  the  contribution  of  road
traffic emission to the total XPAH emissions was estimated to be
23% in urban air of Japan in 2016 [68] .

3.1.4. Other primary sources

Other  chlorine-related  industries,  such  as  chlor-alkali  plants,
are emission sources of ClPAHs. Horri et al. [56] reported higher
concentrations  of  ClPAHs  (8820  pg  g –1  dry  weight)  in  sediment
collected near a former chlor-alkali plant than that collected from
water bodies near other industrialized areas. Ishaq et al. [11] also
identified  higher  concentrations  of  ClPAHs  in  sediment  collected

from industrialized areas containing chlor-alkali plants. Paper pro-
duction is another likely source of ClPAHs. For example, Koistinen
et al. [108] detected polychlorinated fluorene (ClFlu) congeners in
pulp, effluent, and biosludge from a bleached kraft mill and Ishaq
et  al.  [11]  identified  high  concentrations  of  ClPAHs  in  sediment
outside a pulp and paper mill.

Photoreactions may drive the formation of XPAHs. Experiments
on the photochemical products of PAHs in chlorine-containing so-
lutions report the formation of ClPAHs [109] . In addition, Sankoda
et  al.  [12,110]  reported  the  formation  and  accumulation  of  high
amounts  of  9,10-dichloroanthracene  (9,10-Cl
2 Ant)  in  Arao  tidal
flat  sediment  as  a  result  of  their  photo  irradiation  .  Chlorine  is
often applied as a drinking-water disinfectant in water treatment
plants. This treatment has been linked to the formation of ClPAHs
[51,52,111] .  Xu  et  al.  [111]  investigated  the  formation  of  ClPAHs
during chlorine disinfection of drinking water and found 9-ClAnt
and  9,10-Cl
2 Ant  to  be  the  main  mono-chlorinated  and  dichlori-
nated XPAHs formed, respectively. In another study by Wang et al.,
1-ClPyr was the dominant congener in the lake water, wastewater,
sewage treatment plant effluent, and tap water [52] .

3.2. Identification of XPAH sources

Source  identification  is  important  for  tracing  the  origin  of
pollutants,  and  consequently  controlling  pollutant  formation  and
emission.  Congener fingerprints are often  used  as  source  indica-
tors.  The  congener  distributions  of  XPAHs  in  stack  gas  samples
from  multiple  industrial  sources  and  urban  air  in  Beijing  are
provided in Fig. 3 . As shown in the figure, distributions of XPAH
congeners  are  different  among  sources.  Based  on  these  results,
combustion processes predominantly release congeners 9-/2-ClPhe
and 1-ClPyr ( Fig. 3 ) [7,8,76] , while photochemical reactions result
in  a  high  proportion  of  9,10-Cl
2 Ant  [12,110] .  1-bromopyrene  (1-
BrPyr) was the dominant BrPAH congener in the stack gas and air
samples. The only exception is with the stack gas from secondary
copper smelting industry ( Fig. 3 ), in which 9-bromophenanthrene
(9-BrPhe) was the dominant BrPAHs ( Fig. 3 ).

Molecular  diagnostic  ratios  has  been  adopted  to  apportion
different  sources  of  XPAHs.  The  ratios  which  are  often  applied
include  6-ClBaP/1-ClPyr,  3-chlorofluoranthene  (3-ClFlt)/1-ClPyr,
7-ClBaA/1-ClPyr,  6-ClBaP/3-ClFlt,  1-ClPyr/3-ClFlt,  and  7-ClBaA/3-
ClFlt  for  ClPAHs,  and  7-BrBaA/1-BrPyr  and  9-BrPhe/1-BrPyr
for  BrPAHs  [8,64,112] .  Our  previous  studies  provided  informa-
tion  on  3-bromofluoranthene  (3-BrFlt)  /1-BrPyr,  1-BrPyr/3-BrFlt,
7-BrBaA/3-BrFlt, and 9-BrPhe/3-BrFlt concentration ratios in emis-
sions from various industries [7,76] . A summary of XPAH congener
ratios  in  stack  gas  and  fly  ash  samples  collected  from  different
sources are listed in Table 3 , which shows various differences in
the  ratios  among  studies.  For  example,  the  ratios  of  1-ClPyr  /3-
ClFlt are higher in the stack gas samples from waste incinerators,
iron ore sintering plants, secondary aluminum smelting plants and
secondary lead smelting plants than those from secondary copper
smelting plants and cement kiln co-processing solid waste plants.
Principal component analysis (PCA) on data from Table 3 is shown
in  Fig.  4 .  The  ClPAH  and  BrPAH  ratios  show  specificities  among
different sources, which suggests that such information could be
used for tracing the sources of ClPAHs and BrPAHs.

4. Formation of XPAHs and their mechanisms

XPAH  formation  during  different  activities,  e.g.,  combustion
processes,  photochemical  reactions,  and  water  disinfection,  has
been investigated [8,109,111] , and XPAH congeners are reported to
correlate well with their parent PAHs in certain matrices, e.g., par-
ticles and fly ash [8,112] . However, the mechanisms for the forma-
tion of XPAHs, remain unclear. In particular, although electrophilic

chlorination  is  suggested  as  a  major  formation  mechanism  for
ClPAHs [4,78] , the formation mechanisms of BrPAHs are less clear.

4.1. Industries and other anthropogenic combustion sources

As  discussed  above,  many  combustion  processes  are  primary
sources  of  XPAHs.  In  experiments  mimicking  the  combustion  of
PVC and waste printed circuit boards, the organic pollutants, e.g.,
PCDD/Fs  and  PAHs,  and  the  inorganic  compounds,  e.g.,  HCl,  Cl
2 ,
HBr, and Br
2 have been identified as important products [82,113–
115] . Having similar structures and physicochemical properties as
other POPs, in particular PCNs and PCDD/Fs, XPAHs can be formed
together  with  these  substance  classes  in  incomplete  combustion
[4,7,116] .

Previous studies have reported the formation of ClPAHs during
combustion  of  PVC.  For  example,  Wang  et  al.  [4]  simulated  the
burning  of  PVC  in  a  tube  type  furnace  and  found  that  the  for-
mation  of  ClPAHs  increased  with  increasing  temperature  (range
60 0 −90 0 °C).  Conversely,  Miyake  et  al.  [117]  simulated  furnace
combustion of polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) and observed that
ClPAH  levels  decreased  with  increasing  temperature  (80 0,  90 0,
950 °C)  and  increased  with  increasing  residence  time  (2,  4,  8 s).
The dominant ClPAHs during this study were 1-ClPyr and 9-ClPhe.

In  both  studies,  monochlorinated  PAH  congeners  accounted  for
a greater fraction than the higher chlorinated PAH congeners. In
addition, Wu et al. explored formation characteristics for XPAHs on
fly ash matrix from metal smelters [118] . In this study, not only the
concentrations of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PCNs, and PBDEs increased, but
also the concentrations of XPAHs increased once the fly ashes were
heated to 250 −450 °C [118–121] . However, the variation of XPAH
concentrations  with  temperatures  were  different  from  the  varia-
tions of the other chlorinated substance classes i.e., in secondary
aluminum fly ash. Highest XPAH was found at 250 °C, while the
highest  concentrations  of  most  other  POPs  were  found  around
350 °C. This suggests different formation mechanisms [118,119] .

Direct  scission  of  the  PVC  chain  to  form  chlorine  containing
pyrolyzates was reported as a minor degradation pathway during
PVC combustion [122–124] . The first decomposition stage of PVC is
the dehydrochlorination step [123,124] . This suggests that forma-
tion of ClPAHs by direct intramolecular cyclization within chlorine
containing polymers under combustion processes may be a minor
formation  pathway  [4] .  Thus,  formation  of  PAHs  should  be  the
first step in the formation of ClPAHs during combustion processes.
Studies  on  formation  mechanisms  of  BrPAHs  are  still  lacking.
However,  the  formation  of  other  brominated  POPs  seems  to  go
through similar pathways as chlorinated POPs [121] . The formation

pathways of BrPAHs are therefore suggested to be similar to those
of  ClPAHs.  Based  on  the  formation  mechanisms  of  PAHs  during
combustion  processes  [125–127] ,  we  suggest  several  possibilities
for the formation of XPAHs during combustion processes: (1) PAHs
are  chlorinated  or  brominated  to  form  XPAHs;  (2)  during  ring
structure growth, low ring XPAH radicals react with other PAHs,
XPAH radicals, or short-chain unsaturated organics e.g., acetylene,
to  form  high  ring  XPAHs;  and/or  (3)  PAH  radicals  react  with
chlorine  or  bromine  containing  unsaturated  organics.  Whether
these formation pathways occur during real combustion processes
remains unclear, and thus additional research is required to verify
the formation mechanisms of XPAHs.

Nevertheless,  chlorination  pathways  for  the  formation  of
chloropyrene (ClPyr) have been suggested based on PVC combus-
tion. Miyake et al. [78] found chlorination as the major formation
pathway for ClPyr, and following the Arrhenius equation (logarithm
of rate constant (ln k) correlated well with the inverse of temper-
2 Pyr),
ature  (1/T)).  In  addition,  1-ClPyr,  1,3-dichloropyrene  (1,3-Cl
1,6-dichloropyrene  (1,6-Cl
2 Pyr),
2 Pyr),  1,8-dichloropyrene  (1,8-Cl
1,3,6-trichloropyrene  (1,3,6-Cl
3 Pyr),  and  1,3,6,8-tetrachloropyrene
4 Pyr)  were  the  main  mono-  to  tetra-products  formed
(1,3,6,8-Cl
[78] . Therefore, based on the above studies, the pathways for the
chlorination of pyrene (Pyr) are summarized in Fig. 5 .

4.2. Photochemical reactions and water disinfection

Apart from anthropogenic sources, XPAHs are formed in atmo-
spheric processes. Previous studies have reported that atmospheric
concentrations of XPAHs differ from day to night [50,128] . Research
by  Sankoda  et  al.  reported  no  chlorinated  derivatives  generated
from irradiated samples of phenanthrene (Phe) [110] . Other experi-
ments on the formation of XPAHs have indicated that photo irradi-
ation of anthracene (Ant) produces 9,10-Cl
2 Ant, 9-chloroanthracene
(9-ClAnt), and 2-ClAnt [12,110] . In addition, photo-irradiation of Pyr
and BaP in brine solution results in two chlorinated photoreaction
products:1-ClPyr and 6-ClBaP [109] . The photo-chlorination mech-

anisms of PAHs under photo-irradiation are suggested in Eqs. (1) –
( 7 ) [109] . In many environmental matrices, e.g., soils, sediments,
and aerosol particles, metal oxides are abundant. Some studies ver-
ified the formation of ClPAHs under photocatalysis of metal oxides.
For  example,  Sugiyama  et  al.  [129]  tested  nine  metal  oxides  for
their  ability  to  enhance  ClPyr  formation  under  photo-irradiation
and identified titanium dioxide and silicon dioxides as the most
effective for promoting the  formation of  ClPyr  isomers, followed
by  aluminum  oxide,  and  magnesium  oxide,  while  calcium  oxide
did not promote formation. The morphologies of the metal oxides
would also affect the formation of ClPAHs, e.g. dichloropyrene was
detected  in  silicic  anhydride  but  was  not  detected  in  quartz  or
silica gel forms which are also the silicon dioxides [129] .

XPAH  degradation  under  photoreactions  has  also  been  ana-
lyzed. Ohura et al. [130] conducted photolysis of PAH congeners
and  ClPAH  congeners  in  cyclohexane  and  demonstrated  that  the
photostability  of  PAHs  increased  as  BaP  <  benz[a]anthracene
(BaA)  ≤ Pyr  <  Phe  <  fluoranthene  (Flt),  whereas  that

dichlorofluoranthene  (3,4-Cl
2 Flt).  These  results  are  not  totally
consistent  with  other  research,  which  reported  that  the  half-life
of  ClPAHs  under  irradiation  increased  as  follows:  6-ClBaP  <  1-
2 Phe < 9-
ClPyr < 7-ClBaA < 3,9-Cl
2 Phe < 3,9,10-Cl
ClPhe  <  5,7dichlorofluoranthene  (5,7-Cl
2 Flt  =  8-
ClFlt  <  3,4-Cl
2 Flt  <  3-ClFlt  [64] .  However,  the  sequences  of
the  ClPAH  homologues  are  almost  the  same  in  the  two  stud-
ies.  The  photostability  of  ClPAHs  does  not  always  correlate
with  that  of  their  parent  PAHs,  indicating  that  structural  sub-
stitution  of  chlorine  can  affect  compound  photostability.  The
photolysis  products  of  ClPhe  congeners  have  also  been  reported
[130] . For example, the main photolysis products of 9-ClPhe and
2 Phe  are  benzocoumarin  and  chlorinated  benzocoumarin,
3,9-Cl
respectively, whereas the main photolysis products of 9,10-Cl
2 Phe
and  3,9,10-Cl

The chlorination pathways of acenaphthene (Ace) during water

(5-ClAce)  and  3-chloroacenaphthene  (3-ClAce)  found  to  be  the
main  monochloroacenaphthene  (mono-ClAce)  congeners  [111] .
Furthermore, the chlorination processes of Pyr during water dis-
infection  are  same  as  shown  in  Fig.  5 ,  with  1-ClPyr  identified
as  the  main  mono-ClPyr  product,  1,3-,1,6-,  and  1,8-  the  main

4.3. Suggested chlorination mechanisms of ClPAHs

Previous  studies  reported  that  there  were  significant  correla-
tions  between  certain  ClPAH  congeners  and  their  corresponding
parent  PAH  congeners,  which  suggested  that  the  chlorination  of
PAHs is as important mechanism for ClPAH formation [8,112,131] .
Chlorination was also  suggested as  one of  the important forma-
tion mechanisms for PCNs and PCDD/Fs in combustion processes
[132,133] .  The  mechanisms  for  the  chlorination  of  PAHs  to  form
XPAHs in combustion processes, photochemistry, and water disin-
fection have been the subject of intensive, but inconclusive studies.

Fig. 8.  Suggested chlorination mechanisms of ClPAHs; initiated by Cl radical (a) or OH radical (b).

The pathway for the chlorination of parent PAH congeners in vari-
ous matrices was found to be similar [78,109,111,134] . Substitution
of hydrogen by chlorine at different ring sites can lead to different
ClPAH products, except for sites that are symmetric and have the
same energies e.g., 9 and 10 position in Ant and Phe. Chlorination
(chlorine radical reaction) preference for a specific carbon on the
aromatic ring is driven by the frontier electron density of the car-
bon [12,64,135] . The Fukui index (f −1 (x)) has often been calculated
and  used  to  assess/predict  the  relative  tendency  of  electrophilic
chlorine radical reaction at the various carbon positions on an aro-
matic ring of a PAH [111,135,136] . These studies suggest the same
chlorination  preference  of  PAHs:  e.g.,  for  Ant,  9-position  =  10-
position > 1-position = 4-position = 5-position = 8-position > 2-
position = 3-position = 6-position = 7-position ( Table 4 ).

Based  on  the  chlorination  mechanisms  of  other  PAH  deriva-
tives, the chlorination of PAHs to form ClPAHs was suggested to be
initiated by (a) chlorine radicals (Cl • ), (b) hydroxyl ( • OH) or nitrate
• ,  in  ambient  air  during  nighttime  only)  ( Fig.  8 ).
radicals  (NO
3
Using Pyr, Cl •  and  • OH as the examples in Fig. 8 , position 1 has
the highest frontier electron density and therefore has the highest
probability of being first attacked by a free radical. In pathway (a),
the Cl •  reacts with the PAHs at position 1. This is followed by a
second Cl • reaction at position 2, and subsequent removal of HCl.
In pathway (b), the • OH reacts with the Pyr, at carbon position 1,
followed by a second reaction of the radical intermediate with Cl •
at position 2, with the subsequent departure of H
2 O leading to the
formation of 2-ClPyr. As shown in Fig. 8 , pathway (a) leads to the
formation of 1-ClPyr, whereas pathway (b) leads to the formation
of  2-ClPyr.  The  same  mechanism  also  occurs  in  Flt,  with  3-ClFlt
and  1-ClFlt  the  major  products  of  pathway  (a)  and  2-ClFlt  the
major product of pathway (b).

of Cl
2 react with PAHs by electrophilic chlorination under high
temperatures or is catalyzed by transition metal chlorides which
act as the Lewis acid. Mechanisms are shown in Fig. 9 , Scheme 1
[133] . The other mechanisms for the chlorination, i.e., metal chlo-
rides react as the chlorinating agents to facilitate the chlorination
of aromatics by constituting a polarized metal chloride molecule,
or by constituting a organometallic intermediate, were also sug-
gested  during  these  combustion  processes  [133,141,142]  ( Fig.  9 ,
Scheme 2 and 3 ). The highest yield temperature of the chlorinated
organic  compounds,  i.e.,  PCNs,  and  ClPAHs,  as  a  result  of  metal
chlorides  catalyzed  chlorination,  were  suggested  to  be  at  the
temperature of 200 −350 °C [118,120,133] .

ambient conditions, i.e., the aqueous phase present in atmospheric

low. Pathway (a) ( Fig. 8 ) can occur during combustion processes,
photoreactions,  and  water  disinfection  processes  with  hetero-
geneous  reactions.  In  the  presence  of  • OH,  pathway  (b)  is  also
possible.

Cl •  do contribute to the degradation of aliphatic and aromatic
hydrocarbons  in  tropospheric  chemistry  [146–149] .  As  the  main
5 and aerosol chloride
Cl source is the reaction between NO
( Eqs. (12) and ( 13 )) and subsequent photolysis of NO
2 Cl ( Eq. (14) ),
the Cl • is most abundant in polluted coastal environments of some
continents (Europe, South and East Asia) and over some marginal
seas  (Mediterranean,  North  Sea)  [149,150] .  Other  precursors  of
Cl • ,  such  as  Cl
2  have  been  observed  in  the  marine  atmosphere
[148,151] .  The  reaction  rate  coefficients  for  Cl  attack  to  various
3-ring  PAHs  has  been  experimentally  determined  (acenaphthy-
lene  (Acy),  Ace)  or  estimated  (theoretical  chemistry;  Ant,  Pyr)
[152] .  These  are  higher  (Acy,  Ace,  by  a  factor  of  ≈3)  or  lower
(Ant, Pry, by a factor of ≈ 20) than for the OH attack ( Table 5 )
[153] .  This  would  imply  that  the  degradation  of  these  PAHs
even in marine photochemistry would be dominated by the • OH,
considering  that  the  Cl •  concentration  is  expected  in  the  range
10 3 −10 4  molecules  cm −3  in  coastal  regions  [147] ,  in  contrast  to
• OH concentration of 10 5 −10 6 molecules cm −3 . The corresponding
global source terms for few 3-ring and one 4-ring ClPAHs burdens

can be estimated as 191 and 51 t year −1  from Acy and Ace, and

For these PAH source terms, the PAH concentration, C
from the balance of PAH source (i.e., global emissions) and sinks
( Table  5 ;  considering  global  mean  Cl •  and  • OH  concentrations
of  620  and  1.16  ×10 6  molecules  cm −3  [147,154] ). Only  an  upper
bound for the source term for ClPyr isomers can be given, as Pyr
partitions  to  the  particulate  phase  to  a  significant  extent  and,
hence, is subject to additional sinks (i.e., heterogeneous chemistry,
dry and wet particle deposition). Considering the global emission
terms of the PAHs and assuming similar reactivity of PAHs with
Cl • for the same number of rings, the total source term, db
ClPAH /dt,
from pathway (a) can be estimated to be ≈300 t year −1 , with 2/3
due to ClAcy. However, there is no study reporting the contribution
of ClAcy to total ClPAHs in atmosphere yet. Incongruence of the
spatial distributions of PAHs on one hand side and Cl radicals on
the  other  hand  side  may  translate  into  an  uncertainty  of  ±50%.
These  ClPAH  source  terms  will  not  reflect  the  ClPAH  mix  over
coastal areas, open ocean or elsewhere far from sources, because
their chemical (homogeneous and eventually heterogeneous) and
physical (wet and dry deposition of gaseous and eventually partic-
ulate phases) sinks will differ lar gely, and because of an additional
source, pathway (b).

In  daytime  atmospheric  chemistry,  where  the  chemistry  of
PAHs is largely initiated by the attack of the • OH, both pathways
(a)  and  (b)  are  likely  to  occur,  (b)  in  competition  with  both  O
2
(formation of oxygenated PAHs) and NO
2 (formation of nitro-PAHs)
[148,155]  ( Fig.  8 ).  No  estimate  for  the  ClPAH  source  terms  from
pathways (b) can be made, because the relative rate coefficients
of  these  radicals  are  unknown.  Monochloronaphthalene  and  1,2-
dichloronaphthalene,  but  also  coumarin  and  phthalic  anhydride
are formed in the reaction of Cl •  with naphthalene (Nap); ClAce,
acenaphthenone  and  acenaphthenol  are  formed  in  the  reaction
with  Ace;  and  ClAcy,  acenaphthenequinone  and  chloroacenaph-
thenone and naphthalic anhydride in the reaction with Acy [156] .
Cl •  reacts  with  Ace  under  H-abstraction  rather  than  addition,
similar to the reaction of • OH with Ace [156] .

BrPAH  from  atmospheric  chemistry  are  presumably  insignifi-
cant: The activation of Br radicals from sea salt bromide occurs in
snow and brine in northern high latitudes, far from significant PAH
sources [157] . Over the oceans, Br radicals’ abundance is on the
order of 10 7  molecules cm −3  [158] , but because of fast reactions
with ozone and volatile organic compounds, BrPAH yields will be
very low.

are always lower than that of many other 3 ring or 4 ring PAHs
[111,131] . The oxidation processes of atmospheric Ant are suggested
in  Fig.  10 ,  whereby  Ant  is  attacked  by  • OH  to  form  anthracen-
9-ol  (anthranol),  with  10 H -anthracen-9-one  (anthrone)  and
9,10-anthraquinone then formed as oxidation products [159,160] .

Many  studies  have  suggested  that  9,10-Cl

2 Ant  is  found  at
higher concentrations than 9-ClAnt [76,110,131] . In stack gas from
waste incinerators, and in heavily polluted atmospheres, however,
9-ClAnt  has  been  detected  at  higher  concentrations  than  9,10-
2 Ant  [86,131] .  The  relative  Gibbs  free  energies  for  conversion
Cl
of  Ant  to  9-ClAnt  and  9-ClAnt  to  9,10-Cl
2 Ant  have  been  calcu-
lated  in  previous  research  [76] ,  and  suggest  that  the  formation
of 9-ClAnt from Ant requires higher energies than the formation
2 Ant  from  9-ClAnt.  Absolute  hardness  ( η),  a  measure
of  9,10-Cl
of compound stability, is defined as the gap between the energy
of highest occupied molecular orbital ( E HOMO ) and the energy of
unoccupied  molecular  orbital  ( E LUMO ).  η has  also  been  reported
for 9-ClAnt and 9,10-Cl
2 Ant suggested to be
2 Ant [12] , with 9,10-Cl
more environmentally stable than 9-ClAnt. Laboratory experiments
have  also  demonstrated  that  9-ClAnt  rapidly  decomposes  under
continuous  UV  irradiation,  whereas  concentration  of  9,10-Cl
2 Ant
remains constant [110] . These results suggest that the 9-ClAnt/9,10-
Cl
2 Ant ratio is higher in a newly formed mixture than in an aged
mixture  when  steady  state  is  reached.  Therefore,  the  ratio  of
9-ClAnt/9,10-Cl

2 Ant can be used to track the ClPAH sources.

5. Occurrence of XPAHs in the environment

As  discussed  above,  high  concentrations  of  XPAHs  have  been
detected in environmental matrices, including in air [95] , soil [14] ,
and sediment [56] sampled close to combustion and other indus-
trial pollution sources. However, most of the sampling sites in the
environment  are  influenced  by  complex  sources  of  XPAHs.  Here,
we review the literature on the occurrence, distribution, levels and
composition  patterns  of  XPAHs  found  in  various  environmental
matrices  that  are  contaminated  by  emissions  from  fossil  fueled
industries and other combustion sources.

5.1. XPAHs in the atmosphere

Most studies of XPAHs in atmosphere concern urban air (see
Table 6 ). Often only the particulate phase is studied. More studies
were on ClPAHs than on BrPAHs, and a greater number of studies
originate in Asia, especially Japan and China, than in other regions.
As shown in Table 6 , concentrations of ClPAHs in air samples
range  from  10 2  fg  m –3  to  10 2 ng  m –3  in  different  places  and
are 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than those of PAHs and 1–2
orders of magnitude higher than those of BrPAHs. Locations with
high  concentrations  of  PAHs  in  air  will  usually  also  show  high
concentrations  of  XPAHs  because  of  the  similarity  in  sources
of  these  two  compound  groups.  The  highest  concentrations  of
atmospheric  ClPAHs  have  been  reported  in  Beijing,  China,  with
severe  air  pollution  during  the  winter  months  due  to  large  coal
combustion activities to meet heating demands [131] , whereas the
lowest concentration of ClPAHs have been reported in Kanazawa,
Japan, in August [71] .

The  patterns  of  ClPAH  congeners  in  air  samples  are  similar
among various studies. In general, 6-ClBaP is found at the highest
concentration  in  the  particulate  phase,  followed  by  1-ClPyr  and
3-ClFlt  [24,49,50,69,71,112] ,  although  there  are  some  exceptions.
For example, Kitazawa et al. [41] and Ohura et al. [69,112] reported
concentrations of 7-ClBaA as high or higher than that of 3-ClFlt.
Ohura et al. [64] , who studied annual variations of ClPAHs in total
suspended particles (TSP) in Japan, reported higher concentrations
of 1-ClPyr than of 6-ClBaP. Jin et al. [131] described the dominance
of 6-ClBaP in particulate matters collected in summer months in
Beijing, but higher concentrations of 3-ClFlt and 1-ClPyr than of
ClBaP during the heating period in winter. This finding is suggested
to be a result of the dominance of different sources of ClPAHs in
the different seasons. In the gaseous phase, 9-ClPhe is reported to
be the dominant ClPAH congener [49,131] . Due to limited studies
on their characteristics in air, the atmospheric profiles of BrPAH
congeners analyzed in different studies are not uniform. For exam-
2 BaA to be the dominant BrPAH
ple, Ohura et al. [24] found 5,7-Br
congener in particles, followed by 7,12-Br
2 BaA and 6-BrBaP. Con-
versely, Jin et al. [131] reported that 1-bromoanthracene (1-BrAnt),
3-bromophenanthrene  (3-BrPhe),  and  2-bromophenanthrene  (2-

BrPhe)  were  dominant  in  the  gaseous  phase,  whereas  3-BrFlt,
2 Ant),  and  1-BrPyr  were
1,8-  /1,5-dibromoanthracene  (1,8-/1,5-Br
dominant in the particulate phase.

Other atmospheric characteristics of XPAHs, such as gas-particle
distribution and particle size segregation, have been studied. Ohura
et al. [49,128] reported that the concentrations of ClPAHs in the
gaseous phase were more than two times higher, on average, than
those  in  the  particulate  phase.  Jin  et  al.  [36,131]  also  reported
higher fractions of XPAHs in the gaseous phase than in the par-
ticulate  phase  in  the  non-heating  period  in  Beijing,  but  higher
fractions  of  XPAHs  in  the  particulate  phase  than  in  the  gaseous
phase  during  the  heating  period  in  winter  in  Beijing.  The  gas-
particle distribution as well as the mass size distribution of XPAHs
were described as driven by the subcooled liquid vapor pressures
[131,161] . Jin et al. [131] reported that in the particulate phase, 74%
1 . Kakimoto
of ClPAHs and 54% of BrPAHs were associated with PM
et al. [161] reported on the size distributions of ClPAHs and found
that ∼15% were in the ultrafine size fraction ( < 0.1 μm).

The  characteristics  of  atmospheric  XPAHs  are  affected  by
temperature.  Seasonal  trends  in  atmospheric  ClPAHs  have  been
studied,  with  higher  concentrations  found  in  colder  than  in
warmer seasons [49,71,112] , which is similar to what is known for
the  parent  PAHs.  Temperature-driven  anthropogenic  activities  in
cold seasons may be one reason for this, e.g., indoor heating. Tem-
perature can also influence the gas-particle distribution and size
segregation of XPAHs. Ohura et al. [49] established correlations be-
tween temperature and ClPAH concentration in both the gaseous
and  particulate  phases.  Gaseous  phase  concentrations  of  some
ClPAH congeners show significant temperature dependence, with
temperature accounting for 27–63% of variability [49] . Temperature
also exhibits a positive correlation with the volatility of XPAH con-
geners. For example, Jin et al. [36] reported correspondences be-
tween vapor pressure and gas-particle distribution as well as mass
size distribution of XPAHs. The relationship between temperature
and gas-particle partition coefficients ( K p ) has also been evaluated,
with positive correlations found between reciprocal temperatures
and K p , indicating that higher temperature may lead to higher frac-
tions of XPAH congeners in the gaseous phase [36] , similar to what
is established for other classes of semivolatile non-polar organics,
including  the  PAHs  [162-164] .  Significant  correlations  have  also
been found between temperature and geometric mean diameter or
geometric standard deviation of XPAHs in particles, suggesting that
temperature can influence particle size distributions of XPAHs [36] .
Photochemical reactions can also influence the concentrations
of  XPAHs  in  the  atmosphere.  Ohura  et  al.  [128]  reported  that
concentrations  of  particulate  ClPAHs  were  slightly  higher  in  the
night-time than in the daytime, but not for gaseous ClPAHs. Ma
et al. [50] found higher night-time particle concentrations of ClPAH
congeners, such as 9-ClPhe, 3-ClFlt, 1-ClPry, 7-ClBaA, and 6-ClBaP,
than  concentrations  in  the  daytime.  These  studies  indicate  that

photolysis of ClPAHs which occurs during the day is a major pro-
cess that reduces the concentration of XPAHs in the atmosphere.
Parent  PAH  concentrations  can  also  affect  the  concentrations
of  ClPAHs.  Many  studies  on  atmospheric  ClPAHs  have  reported
significant correlations between parent PAH congeners and ClPAH
congeners in the particulate phase [128] . These findings indicate
that chlorination of PAHs is a likely formation pathway for ClPAHs.
Inorganic  anions  can  also  influence  ClPAH  concentrations.,  e.g.,
3 – and Cl – are well correlated with ClPAHs in particles [128] .
NO
Anthropogenic  activities  and  production  can  emit  XPAHs  into
the atmosphere [11,96] . For example, Nilsson and Ostman [96] re-
ported  that  ClPAH  congener  concentrations  in  the  particulate
and gaseous phases were 0.4–10.4 pg m –3  and n.d.–17.5 pg m –3 ,
respectively,  in  urban  street,  and  of  2.0–19.1  pg  m –3  and  n.d–
30.7  pg  m –3 ,  respectively,  in  road  tunnel  samples.  Studies  on
XPAHs  in  air  of  industrial  areas  (including  ambient  air  from
e-waste,  industrial,  and  metallurgical  areas)  have  also  been  re-
ported,  and  are  summarized in  Table  7  [7,68,76,90] . Wang  et  al.
[90] reported higher concentrations of XPAHs from e-waste areas
than  urban  areas.  Jin  et  al.  [76]  analyzed  atmospheric  XPAHs
from a secondary copper smelting plant working places and sur-
rounding areas, and found higher concentrations at the smelting
plant  working  place  than  surrounding  areas,  thus  highlighting
the  industrial  sources.  Xu  et  al.  [7]  also  reported  that  XPAH
concentrations  in  the  ambient  air  surrounding  industrial  areas
were well correlated  with stack gas from  the industries.  No ob-
servations of XPAH in wet or dry deposition have been reported
so far.

5.2. XPAHs in soil, sediment, water and biota

Determined  by  (semi-)volatility  and  lipophilicity,  and  similar
to  most  PAHs  and  PCDD/Fs,  XPAHs  are  expected  to  cycle  across
environmental compartments. The more lipophilic substances (log
K ow ≥ 5) may be bioaccumulative, hence, may lead to significant
exposure in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Compared with at-
mospheric studies, XPAH studies on other environmental matrices
are more limited.

XPAHs in soil have been reported. Ni and Zeng [53] collected
surface soil samples in an urban environment (Shenzhen, China),
and  analyzed  nine  XPAH  congeners,  with  ClPAHs  and  BrPAHs
found at concentrations of n.d.–7.56 and n.d.–134 ng g –1 , respec-
tively. In this study, the ClPAH concentration in soil of traffic sites
was higher than those in agricultural soil, which was also higher
than in soils from greenbelt [53] . Another study by Ma et al. on
the ClPAHs in dust (0.27–206 ng g –1 ) and soil (0.05–94.3 ng g –1 )
samples from Shanghai also suggested the source could be atmo-
spheric deposition of vehicle exhausts [55] . Ma et al. [14] collected
surface  soil  samples  from  the  vicinity  of  an  e-waste  recycling
facility,  chemical  industrial  complex,  and  agricultural  areas  in

central  and  eastern  China,  and  found  average  ClPAH  concentra-
tions of 26.8 ng g –1 , 88.0 ng g –1 , and 0.15 ng g –1 , respectively. The
significantly  higher  concentrations  of  XPAHs  in  polluted  areas
compared  with  agricultural  areas  demonstrates  the  emission  of
ClPAHs during industrial processes. Nishimura et al. [91] also col-
lected soil samples from e-waste open burning areas in Vietnam,
the Philippines, and Ghana, and reported total ClPAH and BrPAH
concentrations of 21–2800 ng g –1 and 5.8–520 ng g –1 , respectively,
which  are  higher  than  those  reported  in  the  above  studies  [14] .
Another study by Fernando et al. [74] also reported concentrations
of ClPAHs in the soil samples were much higher than PCDD/Fs and
comparable  to  PAHs,  after  the  fire  at  the  Plastimet  Inc.  plastics
recycling facility in Canada, which consumed 400 tonnes of PVC.
Due  to  the  limited  studies  on  XPAHs  in  soils,  information  on
XPAH congener profiles is scarce. However, Ma et al. [14] reported
6-ClBaP  to  be  the  dominant  ClPAH  congener  in  soil  samples,
whereas Nishimura et al. [91] reported three ring ClPAHs to be the
dominant ClPAHs, accounting for 53–89% of total ClPAHs.

Analyses  of  XPAHs  in  sediment  are  summarized  in  Table  8 .
As  shown,  concentrations  of  ClPAHs  range  from  dozens  pg  g –1
to  thousands  ng  g –1  and  concentrations  of  BrPAHs  range  from
several  pg  g –1  to  several  ng  g –1 .  The  lowest  concentrations  of
ClPAHs have been reported in Tokyo Bay, Saginaw River watershed,
and Kyushu Island [12,56] , although no ClPAHs were detected in
sediment  from  Danshui  River  in  Taiwan  and  Wajiro  tidal  flat  in
Kyushu  Island,  USA  [12] .  The  highest  concentrations  of  ClPAHs
have  been  found  in  sediment  from  an  industrialized  area  in
Norway  (1200 ng  g –1 )  [11] ,  outside  a  pulp  and  paper  mill  along
the  Swedish  coast  of  the  Bothnian  Sea  (310 ng  g –1 )  [11] ,  and  in
Maozhou River in Shenzhen, China (3.0–301 ng g –1 ) [165] . While
studies  on  BrPAHs  are  limited,  the  highest  concentrations  have
been found in sediments from Maozhou River [165] . These studies
suggest  that  XPAHs  are  emitted  during  anthropogenic  activities,
and  ClPAH  congeners  in  sediment,  such  as  6-ClBaP  and  1-ClPyr,
may be indicators of ClPAH from anthropogenic activities. For ex-
ample, Ishaq et al. [11] , who studied sediments from the Northern
Baltic, Swedish coast of the Bothnian Sea, and Norway, found that
contributions of chlorinated PAH homologues followed the order

chloropyrene/chlorofluoranthene  (ClPyr/ClFlt)  >  chlorophenan-
threne/chloroanthracene  (ClPhe/ClAnt)  >  chlorofluorene  (ClFlu).
In  addition,  Horii  et  al.  [56]  and  Ohura  et  al.  [57] ,  who  studied
sediments  collected  from  anthropogenic  polluted  areas  in  Tokyo
Bay,  Saginaw  River  watershed,  New  Bedford  Harbor,  Brunswick,
Yellow  Sea,  and  Sri  Lanka,  found  that  6-ClBaP,  1-ClPyr,  and  3-
ClFlt were prominent among ClPAHs. Furthermore, Sankoda et al.
[12,110] identified ClPAH congeners (i.e., 2-ClAnt and 9,10-Cl
2 Ant)
as indicators of UV irradiation driven-formation in sediment.

ClPAHs  have  also  been  detected  in  water.  Shiraishi  et  al.
[51] analyzed ClPAHs in tap water, which were found at concen-
trations  of  10 –2 –10 –1 ng  L –1 .  Wang  et  al.  [52]  used  solid-phase
extraction  to  analyze  ClPAHs  in  tap  water,  surface  water  from
Shaoping Lake, wastewater from an industrial plant, and effluent
from  a  sewage  treatment  plant,  and  reported  concentrations
of  ClPAHs  of  n.d.–2.2 ng  L –1 ,  n.d.–25.7,  6.1–35.2,  and  n.d.–20.2,
respectively, with 1-ClPyr found to be the dominant congener.

XPAH  levels  in  leaves  from  e-waste  dismantling  areas  [14] ,
biological samples (river otter,  northern pike, lake whitefish and
snails)  in  an  oil-sands  region,  Canada  [166] ,  rice  [167] ,  mussels
[56]  and  some  freshwater  species  [41]  were  reported.  The  TEQ
concentrations  of  ClPAHs  in  leaves  from  e-wastes  dismantling
areas  (361  pg  TEQ  g –1 )  were  much  higher  than  those  of  PAHs
(4.22  pg  TEQ  g –1 )  and  PCDD/Fs  (147  pg  TEQ  g –1 )  in  the  same
samples [14] . Furthermore, ClPAHs were recently detected in raw
and  cooked  meat  samples,  and  it  was  found  that  cooking  style
would affect the ClPAHs generated [67] .

6. Challenges and future prospects

As the knowledge on several aspects of XPAHs is still lacking,

we suggest several directions for future research.

(a) XPAH formation and degradation mechanisms during combus-
tion and metallurgical processes: These are poorly understood.
Related  research  on  influencing  factors,  e.g.  temperature,
residence  time  and  catalysis  by  metal  oxides,  will  help  to
understand and set abatement-effective combustion conditions

16

R. Jin, M. Zheng and G. Lammel et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 76 (2020) 100803

in order to control XPAH formation, and degrade XPAHs. The
combustion  processes  need  to  be  further  explored,  which
includes,  besides  other,  yet  unaddressed  industries  and  road
transport. Technological measures should be taken to mitigate
such emissions.

(b) XPAH  fingerprints  of  various  different  sources  and  emission
inventories: Fingerprints of XPAHs from several industries are
now  available.  However,  for  the  other  important  sources,  e.g.
e-waste dismantling which is an emerging source, and automo-
bile  emission,  such  information  is  lacking.  The  determination
of substance patterns (fingerprints) of primary XPAH sources,
will serve as the basis for source characterization, assessment,
apportionment anddetermination of emission strengths.

(c) Atmospheric

chemistry

sources:  Globally,

atmospheric
chemistry  of  Cl  radicals  may  result  in  formation  of
300  ± 150  t  ClPAH  year –1 ,  ≈2/3  of  this  as  ClAcy.  Another
significant  source  might  be  provided  by  the  combined  re-
actions  of  OH  and  Cl  radicals.  On  the  global  scale,  these
secondary sources very likely exceed the industrial and mobile
(road traffic) sources. Strongest such source terms are expected
in  polluted  coastal  environments  of  Europe,  South  and  East
Asia.  However,  nothing  is  known  about  the  atmospheric  life-
times  of  the  individual  ClPAHs  and  the  resulting  levels  and
composition of ClPAH outside industrial and urban areas i.e., in
the rural and remote terrestrial and the coastal and open ocean
marine  atmospheric  environments.  Such  field  measurements
apart  from  chemical  kinetic  studies  ((a),  above)  are  needed
to  understand  atmospheric  distribution  and  fate  of  ClPAHs.
Moreover, ClPAHs are formed in anaerobic processes in marine
sediments and more studies are needed in order to assess the
significance for the ClPAH budget.

(d) Physico-chemical and substance degradation data: The physico-
chemical  substance  data  (vapor  pressure,  Henry  coefficient,
water solubility, K ow ) and degradation kinetics data are needed
to  characterize  environmental  fate  and  exposure  and  assess
the  environmental  risk.  Such  data  are  needed  to  assess  the
long-range transport potential and the accumulation of XPAH
in  biota.  Studies  should  determine  XPAH  substance  patterns
at  receptor  sites  and  in  remote  environments,  both  in  air  as
well as in ground compartments (soil, surface water) and biota
(plants and animals) of terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
(e) XPAH analytical methods: The analysis of XPAHs is challenging,
as  standard  reference  materials,  internal  standards,  standard-
ized analytical methods are not available and inter-laboratory
(round  robin)  tests  have  not  been  conducted.  More  standard
reference materials on XPAHs, and the agreement on standard
methods are needed.

(f) Toxicity analysis of XPAHs: Even though the toxicities of several
XPAH congeners have been reported and evaluated ( Table 1 ),
toxicological  information  on  most  XPAH  congeners  remains
to  be  elucidated.  Therefore,  current  studies  on  XPAHs  may
have underestimated their TEQ contributions. Thus, more com-
prehensive  and  accurate  information  on  XPAH  toxicities,  e.g.
mutagenicity, is necessary.

7. Conclusions

Formation and emission during anthropogenic activities (espe-
cially  combustion  related)  are  important  sources  of  XPAHs.  This
article is an up-to-date review of the scientific literature on XPAHs
with  regards  to  their  sources  and  their  formation  mechanism
(e.g.,  waste  incineration,  metallurgical  smelting,  cement  kiln  co-
processing wastes, and vehicular emissions), e-waste dismantling
processes, photochemical reactions, and water disinfection. Waste
combustion and metallurgical smelting are the strongest primary
anthropogenic  XPAH  emission  sources.  E-waste  dismantling  was

also suggested to be an emerging source of XPAHs. However, other
potential sources of XPAHs, such as the automobile emission, have
not  been  characterized  yet.  More  studies  are  required  to  assess
the relative contributions from primary industrial and secondary
photochemical ClPAH sources in the environment. Two alternative
chlorination  mechanisms,  i.e.,  initiated  by  Cl •  or  by  • OH,  are
suggested  to  be  significant  for  XPAH  formation.  These  are  both
significant for the combustion processes as well as in atmospheric
chemistry.  The  contamination  of  the  atmospheric  environment
by specific XPAH sources has been shown. However, atmospheric
long-range transport and the related exposure of the multimedia
remote environment to XPAHs needs to be studied.

XPAHs are an emerging pollutant class, whose environmental
risks  cannot  fully  be  assessed  based  on  present-day  knowledge
of  environmental  exposure  and  also  of  effects  for  humans  and
wildlife.  These  risks  from  XPAHs  should  be  addressed  as  their
toxicological and physico-chemical properties and source strengths
suggest that their adverse effects on health and ecosystem might
be comparable to those of PCDD/Fs.
