    "reasoning": "The answer accurately describes the rate-limiting steps in oxygen permeation through MIEC membranes, correctly identifying both surface reactions and bulk ambipolar diffusion as potential limiting mechanisms. It properly quotes and interprets the original text regarding oxygen permeation dependencies. The explanation of how temperature, pressure, and membrane thickness affect the dominant resistance is thermodynamically sound and consistent with established principles of membrane transport phenomena. The discussion of activation energies and their relationship to temperature-dependent behavior is physically correct. While the answer provides additional context beyond the original text, all elaborations are scientifically accurate and help explain the underlying mechanisms.",

    "reasoning": "The answer accurately describes the physical phenomena at both Umf and Umb transitions, correctly explaining the pressure drop behavior and particle movement patterns. It matches the original text's description of particle behavior at Umf and the subsequent bubbling phenomenon. The explanation of gas bypassing as bubbles beyond Umf is also consistent. The additional context about CSP applications and particle/gas property dependencies is technically sound and relevant to the question.",

    "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the original text and expands on it with correct physical principles. It correctly describes the pressure effects on electron mean free path, the formation of ethane as the first product, and the enhanced methane conversion at higher temperatures. The explanation of Paschen's law and collision frequency effects is physically sound and consistent with fundamental plasma physics. The cause-effect relationships are properly maintained throughout the explanation.",

    "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains why ex-situ configuration yields better results, consistent with the original text. It correctly identifies the key advantages: separate control of operating conditions, selective production of monoaromatics, and reduced catalyst contamination. The physical and chemical principles described are sound, including the relationships between temperature control, residence time, and product formation. The explanation of how separation of pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading leads to better outcomes is logically coherent and aligns with fundamental principles of catalytic processes.",

    "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects and expands upon the key points from the original text regarding closure problems in high-speed turbulent combustion modeling. It correctly identifies that traditional scale-separation assumptions become inadequate due to the close coupling between flow compressions/expansions and combustion. The additional technical details about unclosed terms and specific mechanisms (baroclinic torque, pressure-dilatation effects) are consistent with established combustion science principles. The answer maintains factual accuracy while providing deeper context beyond the original text.",
