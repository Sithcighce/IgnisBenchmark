Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) have attracted considerable attention over the last decade because of
their vital roles in clean energy, consumer product, national defense and security applications, among other uses.
Due  to  the  retention  of  REY  during  coal  burning,  coal  combustion  ash  is  considered  as  potential  alternative
sources for REY. Understanding the content, speciation, retention and/or transformation behavior of REY during
coal combustion not only expands our knowledge of the combustion behavior of the trace elements in coal, but
also  provides  basis  for  modeling  REY  partitioning  during  coal  combustion  and  for  developing  economically
viable REY recovery technologies. This review makes a critical summary of recent progress in the study of REY in
coal ash. The contents and the extraction potentials of REY in coal ash derived from 15 major coal-producing
countries  worldwide  were  summarized  and  evaluated.  Various  analytical  methods  for  determining  REY  bulk
contents  and  speciation,  together  with  the  solid  sample  pretreatment,  analytical  accuracy  and  precision,  ad-
vantages and disadvantages were summarized and compared. Modern analytical approaches combined indirect
methods (e.g., sequential extraction) shed light on the physical distribution, mineralogy, and the chemical state
of  REY  in  coal  ash.  Three  types  of  REY  occurrences  in  coal  ash,  including  Si-Al  glassy  association,  discrete
minerals or compounds, and organic association (bound with unburned carbon) were defined in the review. The
glassy  association  can  be  further  divided  into  REY  minerals  closely  bound  to  glass  phases  and  dispersed
throughout the glassy structure. REY partitioning in various emission streams, the size distribution, and their
enrichment behavior in coal ash were discussed. Thermal behavior and transformation of various REY forms in
coal during combustion process, including organic-associated REY, REY phosphates, REY carbonates, clay-bound
REY and among others were summarized. Two possible retention mechanisms of REY by aluminosilicate glass at
boiler temperature were proposed: the incorporation of the individual REY phases into the glass as inclusions and
the diffusion of REY phases throughout Si-Al glass structures in the melting process. Feed coal mineral types,
mineral-mineral  associations,  boiler  conditions,  and  other  factors  control  the  retention  process.  After  coal
combustion,  the  speciation  of  REY  in  fly  ash  may  be  modified  by  the  reactions  of  REY  phases  with  flue  gas
components. Further, an overview of REY transformation mechanisms during coal combustion was deeply dis-
cussed.  Finally,  current  extraction  techniques  for  REY  recovery  from  coal  combustion  ash  were  introduced.
Future outlooks and research problems were also identified.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background of rare earth elements in coal ash study and their
significance

The story of metals recovery from coal ash (i.e. fly ash and bottom

ash) can be traced back to the late 19th century, at which vanadium (V)
and silver (Ag) were separated from the Poland coal ash [1]. Late in the
20th century much attention has been given to coal combustion residues
(mainly ash) as potential sources for valuable elements including gold
(Au), germanium (Ge), gallium (Ga), and uranium (U) [2]. By the middle
of the 20th century, U and Ge have been commercially extracted from

coal ash residues in the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Japan [3–5].
Coal and its ash even became the main U source for the nuclear appli-
cations in the post-World War II period [6,7]. Today, the extraction of
Ge from the high-Ge coal-derived ash in China and Russian Far East has
been the main sources of Ge (more than 50%) for world industry [8,9].
In case of rare earth elements (herein REYSc represents the sum of the
lanthanides plus Y, and Sc; REY, REE+Y; REE, if both Y and Sc are not
included),  several  international  agencies  and  national  governments
have identified REY, especially the middle and heavy REY as the critical
metals because of their special applications in the high-tech areas, such
as  renewable  energy  technologies,  catalysts,  permanent  magnets,
metallurgical  additives,  and  rechargeable  batteries  [10,11].  The
shortage of conventional rare earth ore deposits in recent years, espe-
cially  the  heavy  rare  earth  elements  (HREY),  stimulated  attempts  to
exploit alternative sources to meet the ever-increasing demand for REY
by modern society [11]. Coal and coal ash containing rare metals have
again attracted special attention by a number of countries including the
United States [12–17], Europe [18–23], China [24–28], Russia [7,29],
India [30,31], South Africa [32], Indonesia [33], and among others to
alleviate the REY resource depletion crises.

Coal  seams  with  anomalously  high  contents  of  rare  and  precious
metals could be possible sources of REY [7,34]. A number of coals, such
as  the  Kentucky Fire  Clay coal  in  Eastern USA  [35,36],  southwestern
China coal [37–39], and Russian Far East coal [29] have been identified
with high REY concentration. For detailed knowledge of REE-rich coal
deposits, readers are referred to the review by Seredin and Dai [7], Dai
et al. [8], and Zhang et al. [40]. To evaluate the coal-related materials as
resources for REY, Seredin and Dai [7] proposed the cut-off grade for
REY oxides (herein used as REO, sum of La2O3  to Lu2O3  plus Y2O3) in
coal  ash  is  0.1%.  Most  of  REY  in  coal  are  inorganic  minerals  (e.g.
REY-phosphates) having high melting, boiling, and thermal decompo-
sition temperature [41], allowing them to be enriched in coal ash after
removal  of  organic  matter  [42].  The  concentration  of  REO  in  ash  re-
sidual after REY-rich coal burning is up to 1-3%, comparable to that of
conventional economic ores [43]. Moreover, the extraction of REY from
coal ash has several advantages over the conventional ores, for example
fly ash is readily available waste with typical particle size ranging from
0.1-100  μm,  which  can  avoid  mining  and  milling  costs  spent  in  the
traditional ores (e.g., carbonatite and ion-adsorbed ores). The recovery
of REY from coal ash is also an innovative use of coal fly ash with higher
economic value. Besides, coal-derived ash is relatively free of radioac-
tive  substances  compared  to  the  radioactive  elements  (Th  and  U)
released with the conventional REE ores utilization [10,44]. In brief, the
recovery of REY as well as critical metals from these waste materials, if
successful on an industrial scale, can both alleviate the REY depletion
crisis worldwide and beneficiate the coal-related industries [7,8].

1.2. Scope of the review

An  increasing  number  of  literature,  scientific  reports,  and  patents
have been published to characterize and extract REY from coal ash, since
the  United  States  Department  of  Energy  (US-DOE)  initiated  several
projects for recovering REY from coal combustion byproducts in 2014
[17]. Before the extraction of REY from coal ash, it is important to make
clear  that  (1)  the  concentration,  physical  distribution,  and  chemical
speciation  of  REY  in  coal  ash  and  (2)  how  these  characteristics  are
associated with the REY extractability. In coal-fired power plants, how
REY partition from coal to fly ash and to which constituents the REY are
bound  in  coal  ash  (i.e.,  fly  ash  and  bottom  ash  or  boiler  slag)  are
dependent  upon  factors  such  as  the  feed  coal  properties,  the  thermal
stability of REE species, boiler conditions (temperature, O2 contents, and
other parameters), and configuration of the flue gas purification devices.
A final viable scheme for REY recovery from coal ash requires identifi-
cation of ash fractions that enrich REY which are easily leached at mild
conditions.  Understanding  the  fate  of  REY  during  coal  burning  in
coal-fired power plants can provide a knowledge basis for modeling REE

partitioning behavior and for designing proper extraction processes to
promote REY recovery from coal ash [8,17].

The recovery of REY from coal and coal ash is ongoing and will be a
hot topic in the foreseeable future. Several review papers are available
related to the concentrations, speciation, and genetic origin of REY in
coal  [6,8,9,17]  and  the  recovery  methods  of  REY  from  coal  and  coal
byproducts [40,45,46]. However, there is no systematic knowledge on
the retention and transformation behavior of REY during coal combus-
tion; and a summary of the contents, distribution, and chemical speci-
ation of REY in coal ash as well as the REY extraction methods is lacking.
To  better  understand  the  resource  base  and  improve  the  knowledge
about REY in coal ash that can be recovered in the future, this paper
serves as a summary review of recent work focusing on the contents,
distribution, speciation, and recovery methods of REY in coal ash, with
special attention to the partitioning behavior of REY during coal com-
bustion. The problems and future outlooks are introduced in each sec-
tion and the end of the paper.

2. Nature of REY-rich coal

2.1. Nature of REY

As defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
[47],  rare  earth  elements  consist  of  15  lanthanides  series  (atomic
number 57 of lanthanum to 71 of lutetium), plus scandium (Sc, atomic
number 21) and yttrium (Y, atomic number 21) (Fig. 1). The electron
configuration for Sc is recognized as [Ar]3d14s2, Y as [Kr]3d14s2, and
REE  as  [Xe]4fn5dm6s2.  The  similarity  in  valence  electron  (outermost
shell) is the reason behind the similarities of physicochemical properties
among the 17 rare earths. Due to differences in electron structures, such
as the number of electrons in 4f orbitals, REY shows different properties
and each of them has special applications in high-technologies [48–54].
Various  classification  methods  have  been  developed  and  used  to  un-
derstand  their  distinct  behavior  in  different  processes,  such  as  rock
geochemical evolution history [43,55–59], mineral processing [60–64],
and  environmental  mobility,  etc.  [65–71].  For  coal-related  studies,  a
classification scheme of rare earth elements has been built by dividing
the REY into light REE (La to Sm) and HREE (Eu to Lu), with Y some-
times being included among the HREE [36,72,73,74]. Seredin and Dai
[7] proposed a threefold classification that is used to divide the REY into
light (LREY; La through Sm), middle (Eu through Dy plus Y), and heavy
rare earth elements (Ho through Lu) (Fig. 1). The ratio of LREE to HREE
(L/H) was used to assess the distribution of REE in coal and coal ash
[29]. To further evaluate coal as a REY raw materials, a threefold in-
dustrial division of REY, i.e., critical (Nd, Eu, Tb, Dy, Y, and Er), un-
critical  (La,  Pr,  Sm,  and  Gd)  and  excessive  (Ce,  Ho,  Tm,  Yb,  and  Lu)
groups is proposed [7,78]. Note that the classification of REY into crit-
ical, uncritical, and excessive groups is somewhat subjective and tran-
sient, contingent upon the global market demands and the supplies on
hand [75]. The price of individual REY fluctuated sharply over the last
decade [76–79].

The abundance of REY in natural samples follows the Oddo-Harkins
rule, in which elements with even atomic numbers are more abundant
than odd-numbered elements [80,81]. This effect can also be reflected in
coal and coal fly ash (Fig 2a). Normalization of REY to reference ma-
terials  is  necessary  to  eliminate  the  “zigzag”  shape  caused  by  the
Oddo-Harkins  effects  and  to  compare  the  fractionation  of  REY  in
different processes. Average concentrations of REY in world coal or coal
ash [82] have been normalized to chondrites [83], Upper Continental
Crust  (UCC)  [84],  North  American  Shale  Composite  [85],  and
Post-Archaean Australian Shale Composite (PAAS) for geochemical and
coal combustion studies. The former (i.e., chondrites normalization) is
suggested not to be used in coal-related studies because chondrite is the
primitive materials of solar systems which is commonly used in igne-
ous/metamorphic geochemistry. It is known that coal is derived from
the  upper  earth  crusts  having  similar  genetic  origins  to  UCC,  and

Fig. 2. Plots showing how REE data are presented. (a) Plots of REE abundances in order of atomic number of rare earths, showing “zig-zag” shape constrained by the
Oddo-Harkins rule; Promethium (Pm, atomic number (61) is omitted because it is not stable in nature; (b) Plots show how normalization of REE concentration data
results in smooth patterns for distribution. The average REE concentrations (parts per million) of the materials shown in the legends represents: 1) Chondrites, data
from Boynton [83]; 2) the upper continental crust (UCC), data from Taylor and McLennan [84]; 3) the North American Shale Composite (NASC), data from Gromet
et al. [85]; and 4) the world hard coal and coal ash, data from Ketris and Yudovich [82].

therefore, REY in coal or coal-related materials are commonly normal-
ized  to  the  average  REY  abundance  in  UCC.  In  addition  to  UCC  and
chondrites,  normalization  to  shale  such  as  the  North  American  Shale
Composite (NASC) [85] has been used in some investigations. In pre-
senting REY data, any of the normalization patterns are acceptable.

When  normalizing  to  UCC,  three  enrichment  types  of  REY  can  be
identified [7,34]: L-type (LREY, LaN/LuN  > 1; N  indicates a value cor-
rected  against  a  standard  distribution,  such  as  the  Upper  Continental
Crust), M-type (LaN/SmN <1, GdN/LuN > 1), and H-type (LaN/LuN <1).
Besides  the  enrichment  types,  the  following  ratios  can  be  used  to
decouple Ce, Eu, and Gd from the other REE in the distribution patterns
[7,34]:

EuN/EuN

* = EuN/(0.67SmN + 0.33TbN)

CeN/CeN

* = CeN/(0.5LaN + 0.5PrN)

GdN/GdN* = GdN/(0.33SmN + 0.67TbN)

(1)

(3)

Different distribution patterns and the distinct features of Ce, Eu, and
Gd correspond to different processes or origins [34], thus REY are a good
tracer  which  has  been  widely  used  in  the  geochemical  and  environ-
mental  studies  [67,86–90].  Other  definitions  of  the  REY  distribution
patterns and REY anomalies (e.g., La and Y anomalies) are also proposed
[29,36,72,73];  therefore,  the  reader  should  be  cautious  to  carefully

examine the definitions in any literature.

2.2. Contents of REY in coal and REY rich coal

2.2.1. Abundance of REY in coals around the world

A  summary  of  average  REY  contents  in  coal  from  some  coal-
producing  countries,  i.e.,  China,  Columbia,  Democratic  People’s  Re-
public (DPR) of Korea, North Asia (Siberia, Russia Far East, Mongolia,
and  Kazakhstan),  Turkey,  and  the  United  States  is  shown  in  Table  1.
Among  the  countries,  coals  from  China  contained  the  most  abundant
REY, followed by Turkey and other countries. Ketris and Yudovich [82]
reported  that  the  average  abundance  of  REY  in  the  world  coal  was
estimated to be 68.6 μg g-1, comparable to that of UCC (Fig. 2b). On the
basis of data from Ketris and Yudovich [82], Zhang et al. [40] estimated
a  total  of  ~  50  million  metric  tons  of  REE  reserved  in  world  coal,
equating to almost half of the REE reserve of traditional REE-bearing ore
deposits.  Note  that  the  concentrations  of  REY  significantly  vary  in
different coal deposits and different mines, or even show large variations
at a single seam in a single mine [36,91–93]. Rare earth elements in coal
are usually at trace level (below 0.1 w.t.%). It is necessary to identify
REY-rich coal or enrich REY in coal ash such to meet the requirement for
the industrial extraction [40].

2.2.2. REY rich coal in major coal-producing countries

Coal is arguably one of the most complicated rocks on earth [100]
and  is  a  typical  geochemical  barrier  that  can  enrich  many  precious
metals, such as REY, U, Ge, Ga, V, platinum group elements (PGEs), and
among others [6,9]. The increasing demand for REY in recent years has
stimulated  the  exploration  of  alternative  rare  earth  sources  including
REE-rich  coal  deposits  around  the  world.  Seredin  and  Dai  et  al.  [7]
proposed the cut-off grade of REY concentration for potential industrial
utilization. The cut-off value of REO content is required to be greater
than 0.1% in coal ash, or 800-900 μg g-1 in coal ash for coal seams with
thickness above five meters. The US-DOE set a criterion in their work for
assessing  raw  coal  as  REY  resources:  the  total  REY  content  shall  be
greater than 300 μg g-1 on a whole dry coal basis. As shown in Table 2,
coal geologists have so far identified several typical REE-rich coal beds
(> 0.1%, ash-basis), such as the Pavlovka coal from Russian Far East
[29],  the  Fire  Clay  coal  from  central  Appalachian  basin  of  Eastern
United States [35,36], and the Fuisui and Heshan coals from Sichuan
basin of southwestern China [38]. These coals and their corresponding
combustion ashes have been considered as potential REY resources. In
some literature, the REY-rich coals are broadly referred as ‘metalliferous
coal deposits’ or ‘coal-hosted ore deposits’, which had been accurately
defined by Seredin and Finkelman [6] as coals with trace element con-
tents  10-times  higher  than  the  world  average.  This  term  has  been
gradually accepted and widely used in many studies thereafter [8,14,17,
100–102].

To date, the study of REY-rich coals in the United States and China,
including the distribution, reserve, geochemical behavior [24,37–39,91,
105,106] and related extraction method [27,107,108] have come a long
way in the last decade. The United States Geological Survey systemati-
cally investigated the spatial distribution of REY in coals from different

US coal basins. All the data has been recorded in the USGS Coal Quality
database, known as the COALQUAL database with the latest Version 3.0
(V3.0) published online (https://ncrdspublic.er.usgs.gov/coalqual/). As
shown in Fig. 3, samples with REY contents higher than 1000 μg g-1 (ash
basis)  are  densely  distributed  in  the  Appalachian  and  Black  Warrior

Fig. 3. Coal-hosted REE metallogenic zone across the United States. Black dot
represents the sample containing REY greater than 1000 μg g-1 (ash basis). The
distribution  map  of  REE-bearing  coals  was  obtained  from  the  web-based
COALQUAL  V3.0  database  at  the  USGS  website  (https://ncrdspublic.er.usgs.
gov/coalqual/).

basins.  Other  regions,  including  the  Illinois,  Forest  City,  and  Arkoma
basins, etc., are sporadically distributed with REY-rich coals. Based on
the data of 5378 coal samples from USGS COALQUAL database, Lin et al.
[109] estimated that about 9-13% of the samples in the Unites States are
promising coals for REY extraction. Bituminous coals from Central Ap-
palachian  region,  especially  from  Eastern  Kentucky  are  probably  the
best option for the beneficial recovery of REY [35,36,109].

recognized,  namely

Coals from China, especially from southwestern China, contain high
concentration of REY [37,38,92,106,110,111]. Based on the location of
coal  basins  and  their  regional  tectonic  back-ground,  two  coal-hosted

REE  metallogenic  zones  have  been
Erlian-Hailaer

REY
Sichuan-Yunnan-Guangxi REY mineralization belt [106]. As shown in
Fig.  4,  the  first  region  is  situated  in  the  Erlian  basin  of  northeastern
China,  where  the  REY-rich  coals  are  mainly  formed  in  early-middle
Jurassic period. The average REY concentration of coal is 397.3 μg g-1
and the maximum concentration can be up to 1461.2 μg g-1. The second
coal-hosted REY metallogenic belt locates in the southwestern of China,
including coal deposits from Sichuan province, Chongqing city, Guangxi
Province,  and  Yunnan  Province.  Dai  et  al.  [34,37–39],  Zhuang  et  al.
[112,113], Zhao [110,114], and among others [115–118] have studied
the REY origins and distribution in the coals from the REY mineraliza-
tion belt. Average abundance of REY in this region is estimated to be in
the range of 874 μg g-1  to 2497 μg g-1  (ash basis) and have thus been
considered as promising coals for REY recovery [37,38,92]. According
to the data from China Geological Survey (https://www.cgs.gov.cn/xw
l/ddyw/201802/t20180226_451616.html), the total reserve of REY in
these coal-hosted ore approaches approximately 11.3 million tons.

Overall, the REY-enriched coals from the US and China have been
used  as  steam  coal  for  power  generation  for  many  years  [16,28,
119–122];  the  combustion  process  can  further  enrich  REY  in  the  ash
which is beneficial to the extraction. While a few coal-hosted REE ore
deposits have been identified worldwide, the uneven distribution of REY
in different coals from different regions still requires a full investigation
of  REY  distribution  before  the  industrial  extraction  and  utilization.
Taking the distribution of REY in China as an example, while the average
REY content in Chinese coal (136 μg g-1) is higher than the world coal
[95], many coal deposits in China cannot be used as potential raw ma-
terials  for  REY  extraction.  The  North  China  coal  basin  is  the  most
important  coal  producing  area  for  Chinese  industry,  however,  the
average content of REY in the northern Chinese coals is estimated to be
111.2 μg g-1 [123], much lower than the extraction criterion [7].

2.3. REY occurrence in coal

The modes of occurrence of REY in coal are important to anticipate
their behavior during coal combustion. REY in coal are closely associ-
ated with their geological origins, i.e., detrital inputs from the source
rocks by wind and water, mineralized REY-rich fluids, and volcanic ash
deposits [8,9,34]. Achieving a detailed knowledge of REY speciation in a
coal is difficult because: (1) REY enrichment in coal is usually a function
of multiple modes of mineralization resulting in complicate REY asso-
ciations  [35]  and  (2)  the  concentration  of  an  individual  element  is
commonly less than 100 μg g-1. Broadly, REY in coal can be classified
into  inorganic  and  organic  matter  associations  (Fig.  5)  [7,132].  The
inorganic forms are the common REY associations in coal including in-
dividual  REY-bearing  minerals  (such  as  phosphates,  sulfates,  carbon-
ates,  and  fluorocarbonates,  etc.),  substitutions  in  the  crystalline
structure of accessory minerals (zircon, apatite, etc.), adsorbed to clay
minerals, and dissolved in pore waters in coal [7,133,134]. For organic
associations, REY in low-rank coal might be bound with carbon func-
tional  groups  (e.g.  -COOH  and  OH)  or  form  organometallics  [72,91,
124]. To model the partitioning behavior of REY during coal combus-
tion, study of REY forms in coal should answer the following questions:
(1)  what  is  the  ratio  of  each  REY  associations  (mass  balance  of  REY
forms) in REY-rich coal? (2) what is the size range of REY-bearing par-
ticles in coal and how does REY-bearing phases distribute in coal matrix?
(3) what are the thermal properties of common REY-bearing species in
coal?

2.3.1. Proportions of organic and inorganic associations of REY in coal

Besides REY binding forms, the study of different REY associations
and  their  proportions  in  coal  is  important  to  the  prediction  of  REY
speciation in coal ash and understanding REY transformation behavior
during  coal  combustion.  However,  quantitative analysis  of  each  asso-
ciation in coal is hard to be achieved by current techniques. Considering
the thermal stability of REY-bearing phase, more attention is given to
the distribution ratio of REY in organic matter and inorganic matter in
coal. In general, coal minerals are the primary hosts of REY especially in
high-rank coals [7,133,135]. A part of REY are considered to be asso-
ciated with organics in low-rank coals, such as lignite [29,72,127]. The
first literature supporting the organic occurrences of REY in coal might
be from Yershov [128], who favored the organic bonding of Y and Yb in
Kizelovsk coal from the former Soviet Union. Seredin and his colleagues
[29,129] found that about 50% of REY in the lignite and subbituminous
coals in the Russian Far East region can be extracted by 1% NaOH, which

are considered to be distributed in the humic matter. The organic as-
sociation  of  REY  in  coal  was  further  reported  in  various  coals  from
different countries, and confirmed by a series of adsorption experiments
(adsorption of REY onto humic and fluvic acids, peat, and coals) [29,72,
127].

Since  early  the  1980s,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  investi-
gated the modes of occurrence of REY in coals of various ranks (from
lignite to bituminous coal) through selective leaching procedure [125,
130,131].  Although  indirect,  sequential  extraction  experiments  can
rapidly provide the opportunity to quantify the REE occurrences in coal.
The results showed that REY in most coals occur in monazite, xenotime,
and  other  phosphate  minerals,  and  less  than  10%  of  the  total  REY
existing in US lignite was associated with organic matter [132]. On the
basis  of  summarizing  their  previous  studies  and  using  the  same
sequential leaching protocol on another 20 international coal samples,
Finkelman et al. [125] concluded that most of LREY (> 90%) in coal
occurred in mineral phase and about 25-30% HREY had an organic as-
sociation (Table 3). Further selective leaching on low-rank coals found
that  more  REY  were  associated  with  organics  than  that  of  high-rank
coals.  Lin  et  al.  [124]  estimated  that  25%  REY  were  associated  with
organics in the low-ash central Appalachian coals. Based on the organic
solvent extraction on seven coals from Shanxi, China, Wang et al. [91]
suggested  that  REE  in  organic  matter  were  probably  adsorbed  by
hydrogen-containing  functional  groups  and  HREE  might  be  directly
bound to carbon. Dai et al. [133] also found that aluminosilicates were
the primary hosts for REE in bituminous coals from Ningxia Province of
China.  However,  although  HREY  are  gerenerally  considerded to  have
preferences for coal organic matter, there are still disputes on the dis-
tribution  of  LREE  and  HREE  in  different  occurrence  modes  [72,125,
138].

In summary, REY in coals have both inorganic and organic associa-
tions, and low ash and low rank coals generally have more organically
associated REY than high-ash and high-rank coals. However, the pro-
portions of organically- and inorganically-associated REY differ between
coal deposits and even with samples from a single coal bed, which are
certainly a function of geological settings of coal basins (e.g., source-
rock  properties,  volcanic  eruptions,  etc.),  weathering  conditions  dur-
ing peat and coal formation, and depositional environment [7,125]. The
share of each REY forms in the balance of the total REY in Table 3 is a
general result and can be updated with more studies carrying out in the
future. To develop reliable sequential extraction procedure, verification
experiments by direct techniques and double-checked by leaching pure
substance and certified coal standards are strongly suggested.

essential  to  understanding  their  partitioning  behavior  during  coal
combustion. According to the chemical components and the modes of
occurrences as noted above, REY-bearing mineral grains in coal can be
divided into:

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)1009546

B. Fu et al.

• REY  phosphates,  including  monazite,  xenotime,  florencite,  and

water-bearing aluminum phosphates;

• REY  carbonates,  including  bastnaesite,  lanthanite,  kimuaite,  and

important  information  on  predicting  size  distribution  of  REY  in
coal-derived  ashes.  However,  there  are  several  severe  limitations  to
quantify the REY containing minerals in coal via CCSEM technique:

others;

• Isomorphic  admixtures  in  minerals:  zircon,  apatite,  REY-bearing
aluminum phosphates, sulfates of the alunite supergroup (APS min-
erals); and

• Adsorbed onto clays.

The size of these REY-bearing particles can vary from several tens of
microns (Fig. 6a), to several microns (Fig. 6b and c), to the submicron to
nanometer scale (Fig. 6d) [37,39,135]. The size and shape of REY par-
ticles  are  associated  with  their  different  origins.  In  addition  to  the
discrete minerals inherited from the source region (i.e., volcanic ash or
peralkaline basement rocks of the coal basin) [36,136–138], a number of
SEM-EDS  studies  have  shown  that  the  fine  authigenic  REY-bearing
minerals,  formed  from  chemical  or  biochemical  precipitation  of
REE-bearing mineralized solutions, are typical forms for the majority of
REY-enriched  coals.  These  fine-grained  clastic  and  authigenic  REY
minerals  usually  have  particle  size  less  than  10  μm  [14,35,37–39,92,
110,111,135,136,139].

scanning

electron  microscopy

The  fine  particle  size  of  REE-bearing  mineral  grains  and  the  low
concentration of individual REY in coal make the quantification of the
size distribution of REY mineral grains a challenging task. Based on the
computer-controlled
techniques
(CCSEM), a research team from the University of North Dakota found
that 97 REE-bearing particles of 3307 particles in a lignite are all less
than 10 μm [140] (Details are available at https://edx.netl.doe.gov/d
ataset/70fc29f0-91d5-4fed-83bb-93fe0d0c0c66/resource/45ae0e7
9-9470-4db1-8869-9716afbd7302). Indeed, 75% of the 97 REE-bearing
particles are in the size range of 0.4-1.0 μm. The particle size of most of
REE-bearing phase in REY-rich coal is considered in the size of < 10 μm
and some fractions are even sub-micron particles [140]. This provides

• Even in the REY rich coal, the lower concentrations of REY, espe-

cially the HREY are below the detection limits of EDS;

• The REY minerals are chosen and identified based on their chemical
compositions, thus, there is no allowance for identifying an unclas-
sified particle or particles with different chemistry from those in the
mineral data files;

• Interference peaks in some cases appear in the EDS spectra, requiring

de-convolution of the overlapping peaks; and

• Nano-sized  REE-bearing  minerals  might  occur  in  other  mineral
matrices  (such  as  kaolinite),  making  the  quantification  analysis
difficult and inaccurate.

In  addition  to  the  particle  size  distribution,  spatial  distribution  of
REY-bearing particles within single coal particle is another important
parameter  affecting  REY  combustion  behavior  in  coal-fired  power
plants.  REY  bound  with  included  minerals  within  coal  char  might  be
subjected to a more reducing and a higher temperature condition than
the  excluded  minerals  [141,142].  Therefore,  the  decomposition  and
evaporation  of  the  included  REY-bearing  minerals  might  be  strength-
ened. Previous electron microscopy studies revealed that REY-bearing
mineral  particles  seemed  to  mainly  occur  in  the  organic  maceral  of
coal [6,35,100,126,143]. Some of them are dispersed into coal macerals,
and a part of REY mineral grains are embedded in other mineral matrix,
such  as  clay  minerals  and  carbonates  within  a  coal  particle  (Fig.  6).
Excluded REY-minerals in coal is rarely reported in published literature.
The CCSEM study as illustrated in the technical report further demon-
strated that the REY-bearing particles mainly occur as included minerals
in coal [140].

3. Determination of REY in coal ash

As shown in Fig. 7, methods for analysis of REY in coal ash can be
divided into the following categories: (1) methods that measure the total
REY concentrations and (2) methods that determine speciation of REY in
coal ash. Both the bulk elemental analysis and speciation analysis for
REY in coal ash are critical to design cost-effective and environmental-
friendly  extraction  methods.  The  use  of  various  techniques  for  trace
element analysis has been developed for many years; however, a reliable
and accurate determination of REY in coal ash still has some problems.
This is mainly because (1) the complex matrix of the organic/inorganic
constituents in coal ash and potential contamination during sampling,
preservation,  and  pretreatment  procedure,  all  of  which  make  REY
determination  difficult  and  complicated;  and  (2)  REY  associations  in
coal ash are usually too fine (also few) to be discerned and are hetero-
geneously distributed among crystalline minerals, amorphous materials,
and unburned carbon [144–147], making the accurate speciation anal-
ysis very difficult. Therefore, conventional analytical methods used for
quantifying  REY  contents  in  various  materials,  including  gravimetry,
titrimetric,  spectrophotometry,  and  atomic  absorption  spectrometry
(AAS) have limitations, such as high detection limits, low sensitivities,
poor  accuracy,  and  time-consuming  process.  These  methods  are  not
suitable for REY determination in complicated coal ash and will not be
considered in this review.

Previous summary of trace elements (mainly toxic elements) deter-
mination in coal and coal ash has been quite extensively made, including
reviews and papers by Karr [148], Vouropoulos [149], Huggins [150],
Bullock  [151],  ASTM  [152].  Nonetheless,  few  studies  focused  on  the
REY determination in coal-related materials. The following section will
review the REY analytical methods in coal ash, based on the available
literature published over the last thirty years.

Fig. 8 is a statistical illustration of the share of various methods in the
analyses  of  lanthanides.  In  the  last  two  decades,  the  most  common
analysis methods of bulk REY in coal ash are inductively coupled plasma
mass  spectrometry  (ICP-MS)  [16,18,19,22,23,27,28,32,33,93,97,107,
108,119,120,158,165,166,169-171-173,175-182,185-186,190–196,
204,230,234,237-238,246-247,250-253,258-259,262,264,270,272,
364-367],  followed  by  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission
spectrometry or atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES/AES) [15,22,
30,31,33,122,140,159,161,163-164,173,184-186,231,236,363],
instrumental  neutron  activation  analysis  (INAA)  [32,98,125,131,140,
185-186,211-213,357],  and  X-ray  fluorescence  (XRF)  [20-21,186,
215-220]. Other common-used techniques for the trace elements anal-
ysis in coal ash, including atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) and
atomic  absorption  spectrometry  (AAS),  are  difficult  for  quantitative
determination  of  REY,  because  the  stable  compounds  forming  at  the
flame zone lead to low atomization efficiency and potential spectra in-
terferences.  Direct  analysis  techniques,  such  as  laser-induced  break--
down spectrometry (LIBS) for solid samples, are still under development
[153].  Hence,  the  following  text  reviewed  here  will  focus  on  bulk
analysis of REY in coal ash by ICP-OES, ICP-MS, XRF, and INAA.

237-238,246-247,250-253,258-259,262,264,270,272,364-367],  ICP-OES  [15,
22,30,31,33,122,140,159,161,163-164,173,184-186,231,236,363],  INAA  [32,
98,125,131,140,185-186,211-213,357], and XRF [20-21,186,215-220] used in
REY  determination  in  coal  ash,  data  compiled  from  the  published  literature
over last thirty years.

For  the  solid  ash  particles,  sample  pretreatment  is  a  key  step  for
preparing a sample for ICP-based analysis. The first principle for sample
preparation for trace element analysis requires producing samples that
are representative of the original material without alteration, either by
losses of volatile fractions or by adventitious additions. Although some
researchers  attempted  to  introduce  suspended  solids/slurries  or  pul-
verized coal into the high temperature plasma [154–156], the precision
and  reproducibility  for  the  elemental  determination  are  poor  [150].
REY-containing aqueous solutions obtained from solid ash particles by
acid digestion and/or alkaline fusion are required for ICP-based tech-
niques  [16,19,22–24,28,42,108,120,152,157–161].  Several  sample
preparation  methods,  such  as  acid  dissolution,  bomb  decomposition,
alkaline fusion, and sintering have been widely used in numerous lab-
oratories. Here, a short review of the sample pretreatment methods is
made before the review of REY analysis through ICP-based techniques.
The pretreatment methods for coal ash includes:

■  Open acid digestion (hot plate digestion)
■  Closed vessel digestion
■  Microwave digestion
■  Alkaline fusion or sintering

Open  acid  digestion  is  commonly  used  for  sample  preparation  for
REY determination in coal ash by the means of ICP-OES/MS (Table 4).
Several national standard methods have set up detailed digestion pro-
cedure  using  open  acid  digestion  method,  such as  American  ASTM  D
6357-19  [152],  Chinese  Standard  MT/T  1014-2006  [162],  and  ISO
23380. It generally involves weighing certain amounts of coal ash (0.1g
or more), transferring the sample to an anti-corrosive container (e.g.,
Teflon cups), and adding concentrated acid and/or other oxidation re-
agents at a fixed mixing ratio. Next the digestion vessel is placed on a hot
plate with all the acids, especially HF, being nearly completed evapo-
rated. The obtained wet solid (mainly salts) is re-dissolved with dilute
HNO3, filtered, and diluted to a certain volume. Most of ash components,
including unburned carbon, aluminosilicates, carbonates, sulfates, and
other mineral or mineraloids, can be dissolved with the acid mixtures.
However,  some  REY-bearing  particles  (such  as  zircon)  may  not  be

dissolved;  therefore,  higher  digestion  temperature  (130-150
C)  and
longer digestion time (at least 5 h) are required for complete dissolution.
Obviously, the main advantages of the open hot-plate digestion method
over other pretreatment methods are its simplicity and low cost; how-
ever, the drawbacks are also evident, including the high amount of acid
consumed,  acid  mist  escape,  and  longer  time  for  the  whole  digestion
process. For example, 40-ml HF plus aqua regia are consumed by the
ASTM D 6357 method and a longer time, including the ashing, digestion,
evaporation, and re-dissolving process, is required compared to other
techniques.

The  closed-vessel  digestion  method,  also  known  as  oxygen-bomb
decomposition  is  widely  used  in  rock  dissolution  for  geochemistry
studies. It is based on transferring known amounts of samples and mix
acids to a Teflon-lined bomb. Then, the closed vessel is stirred, sealed,
and  placed  in  an  electric  oven  at  a  high  temperature  (190
C).  After
dissolution, it is necessary to drive off the acid (HF) at a certain tem-
◦
perature (e.g., 140
C). These procedures can be repeated for achieving a
complete  dissolution  of  the  solid  residual.  For  REY  determination,
Querol  et  al.  [170,171]  developed  a
two-step  closed-vessel
acid-digestion method for trace elements determination in coal and coal
fly ash (Table 4). Trace elements are sequentially extracted with HNO3
(volatile elements) and HF-HClO4-HNO3  (non-volatile elements). Tag-
gart et al. [16] proposed a simple closed-vessel method for total REY
quantification analysis. Coal ash (34 ± 1 mg) was digested overnight at
90-100
C with 2-ml each of HNO3  and HF. The acidified sample was
then evaporated to dryness and further re-digested overnight at 90-100
◦
C in a mixture of HNO3-H2O2. The recovery of NIST fly ash 1633c was
in  the  range  of  89.2-102.4%.  The  closed  PTFE-lined  stainless-steel
bombs or Parr bombs used for dissolving rocks at high temperature and
high pressure are also used for coal ash digestion [28,171,177]. Overall,
the recoveries of closed-vessel digestion were satisfied by comparing the
test value to the certified values of NIST Standard Reference Materials

(SRMs) (Table 4). It can be used for REY analysis in ash samples, and the
amount  of  acid  volume  and  the  operation  steps  could  be  reduced
compared to the open acid-digestion method. However, the whole time
for  the  digestion  is  long  and,  thus,  the  working  efficiency  would  be
affected if many ash samples need to be analyzed. In addition, care must
be taken to avoid (1) the loss of volatile REY species in the vapor that
might escape when the pressure is released and (2) the loss of elements
by adsorption on the walls of the bomb.

A  number  of  laboratories  use  microwave  digestion  systems  to
dissolve coal ash for REY determination [19,27,119,158,161,169,172,
173,178–180]. For microwave digestion, a known amount (~ 0.1g) of
coal ashes plus certain volume of mixed acids are digested in a micro-
wave  oven.  Next,  the  mixture  is  heated  to  remove  the  HF  and
re-dissolved with acids. In comparison to open acid digestion and closed
vessel digestion, the microwave digestion can greatly reduce the time
and  acid  volume  required  for  the  sample  dissolution.  As  shown  in
Table 4, the longest duration time for microwave digestion reported in
the  published  literature  is  within  two  hours  and  the  total  volume  of
mixed acid is generally below 10 ml. Important operation parameters
including digestion time, temperature, pressure, acid types, and the ratio
of solid-to-acid adopted in the microwave digestion vary significantly
among different laboratories. All of these parameters affect the detection
of  REY  by  ICP-OES/MS  [172,173].  However,  detailed  pretreatment
methods or the data for quality control are not reported in many pub-
lished  studies  (see  the  ‘recovery  column’  in  Table  4).  Thus,  it  is  rec-
ommended that the accuracy and precision of the analytical procedure
should be presented in further research literature. In addition, compared
with  other  pretreatment  methods,  few  international  or  national  stan-
dards  give  certified  microwave  digestion  methods  for  ash  digestion.
Considering  the  great  advantages  of  microwave  digestion  over  other
pretreatment methods, future efforts are required to develop standard
microwave digestion methods.

Finally, alkaline fusion method is also a potential choice for sample
preparation  for  REY  determination.  It  is  based  on  the  fusion  of  ash
samples with alkaline materials (lithium meta-/tetraborate, Na2O2, and
among  others)  at  high  temperature  (450
C  or  higher).  After  cooling
down, the homogeneous glassy materials are dissolved with HNO3  or
HCl. REY in the resulting solutions will be finally analyzed by either ICP-
OES or ICP-MS. Among the alkaline fusion methods, lithium meta/tet-
raborate alkaline sintering has been the most popular methods for pre-
paring a liquid sample for REY quantification. Briefly, coal ash is added
to lithium metaborate or borate flux, thoroughly mixed, fused in furnace
at  1000-1100
C,  and  the  resulting  solids  are  re-dissolved  in  diluted
HNO3. This method has been written in the ASTM D4503-08 [174] for
trace elements determination (REY not included) in solid waste, and has
been further used for REY quantification in coal ash in literature [174].
Besides, Na2O2 alkaline sintering was also used in REY determination in
ash samples, as proposed and used by several USGS laboratories [174,
C) required in the digestion is

significantly  lower  than  that  of  lithium  metaborate  or  borate  fusion
method,  but  acid  concentration  for  the  subsequent  re-dissolution  is
higher (25% HNO3) compared to the ASTM alkaline fusion method (5%
HNO3). In addition to Li meta/tetraborate alkaline fusion and sodium
peroxide sintering, Mondal et al. [31] used alkali fusion (NaOH-NaNO3)
method for REY quantification in coal ash.

◦

Overall,  due  to  the  encapsulation  of  REY  within  aluminonsilicate
glass of coal ash (see section 5), the analysis of REY requires reagents
that can decompose the glass matrix. In comparison to acid digestion,
alkaline  fusion  is  more  effective  in  extracting  REY  from  the  matrix.
Among the alkaline reagents, Na2O2 and NaOH were the most effective
reagents  for analysis of REY in coal ashes [167]. Attention should be
paid to the high procedural blanks for example the introduction of Ba,
Ca, and other interfering elements, since a large volume of flux used in
the fusion process could be detrimental to trace analysis of individual
rare  earth  elements.  For  example,  scandium  cannot  be  accurately
determined  (overestimated)  using  the  method  described  by  the  U.S.
Geological  Survey,  because  the  use  of  Zr  crucible  can  result  in  Zr
interfering with the Sc analysis [16,32,167].

To  further  benefit  the  readers  and  researchers  in  measuring  REY
contents  in  coal  ash,  here  the  DOE-supported  round-robin  interlabor-
atory study (RRIS) was served as a typical example to compare the re-
sults (also the pros and cons) of different pretreatment methods on REY
determination  in  coal  ash.  In  the  round-robin  inter-laboratory  study
[140], thirteen qualified laboratories participated in determining rare
earth elements in coal, coal ash, and other related materials for evalu-
ating the accuracy, precision, and intra-/between-laboratory reproduc-
ibility  of  pretreatment  methods  on  REY  determination  in  coal  ash
(Table  4).  Eleven  materials  including  coals  of  different  rank,  coal  fly
ashes,  coal-bearing  rocks,  and  mine  waste  as  well  as  four  standard
reference materials (SRM NIST 1633c, 1632e, 2780a, and USGS SBC-1)
were sent to the laboratories and prepared via three procedures:

■  Procedure A: ASTM D6357 method–Mixed acid (i.e., hydrochloric,
nitric, and hydrofluoric) digestion with heating followed by ICP-MS/
OES analysis;

■  Procedure B: ASTM D4503 – High-temperature lithium borate fusion

digestion followed by ICP-MS/OES analysis; and

■  Procedure C: Microwave digestion – Mixed acid (i.e., hydrochloric,
nitric, and hydrofluoric) digestion with heating plus the addition of
boric acid to neutralize the hydrofluoric acid followed by ICP–MS.

The results indicated that Procedure A and Procedure B are effective
for  total  REY  extraction  from  the  ash  particles  (Table  5),  showing
acceptable  recoveries  (±15%)  for  fly  ash  reference  material  (NIST
1633c). In terms of the precision, the reproducibility RSD results showed
that both open acid digestion (Procedure A) and alkaline fusion (Pro-
cedure B) can perform excellently in producing concentrations of REY
with lower RSDs (< 5%); and Procedure A performed slightly better than

Procedure B because the introduction of alkali reagents into the solution
may result in matrix interferences, which should be reduced by diluting
the  digestion  solution prior  to ICP-MS  analysis.  Procedure  C,  i.e.,  the
mixed acid digestion with heat plus the addition of boric acid showed
the worst mean recoveries (62-96%) and repeatability (RSD > 5%). It is
suggested that both of the acid digestion (without boric acid) and the
alkaline  fusion  methods  can  be  effective  in  REY  determination.  In
addition to these two procedures, any other pretreatment methods can
be  used  before  providing  appropriate  validation  with  reference
materials.

3.1.2.

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)
ICP-OES, which is also known as inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission  spectrometry  (ICP-AES)  has  been  widely  used  in  analysis  of
REY  in  coal  and  coal  ash  [15,30,31,122,156,159,163,164,167,173,
183–186].  The  superior  properties  of  the  ICP  torch  as  an  excitation
source can produce a very high-temperature plasma (7000-10,000 K).
Solutions containing REY for analysis are pumped into the nebulizer and
sprayed as aerosols into the hot plasma, where it can easily atomize and
ionizes the refractory REY. The excited rare earth species naturally emit
their  unique  radiation,  which  are  then  detected  by  the  spectrometer.
Modern  ICP-OES  can  simultaneously  analyze  up  to  70  elements  with
polychromatous or array detectors and also enjoys several advantages in
comparison  to  conventional  techniques,  such  as  direct  current  arc
spectrometry  or  alternating  current  spark  spectrometry  :  (i)  the  high
temperature (above 7000 K) and electron density (1014-1016 cm-3) of
the plasma can destroy almost every species in the sample, minimizing
the chemical interferences; (ii) low background emission and chemical
interferences;  (iii)  good  accuracy  and  precision;  (iv)  wide  linear
response range; and (v) reasonable costs compared to other trace ele-
ments analytical techniques, such as INAA and ICP-MS.

The accuracy of ICP-OES, like other analytical techniques, decrease
significantly when approaching the limits of detection (LOD). To reach
an accuracy in the range of 2%, the minimum concentration of the an-
alyte should at least be 100-times the LOD. The LOD of the method is
sample and matrix dependent, and for lanthanides it is usually in the
range  of  0.1-100  μg  L-1.  Usually, the  concentration  of  individual  rare
earth elements in coal ash is below 100 μg g-1 and a part of REY is at sub-
μg g-1  level. Thus, quantification of trace amounts of REY in digestion
solutions,  especially  for  most  HREY  (Tb  and  Ho  to  Lu)  in  coal  ash  is
difficult by ICP-OES technique. Readers should be cautioned to the data
listed  references  in  Table  4,  where  most  of  the  ash  samples  have
extremely high total REY contents (> 1000 μg g-1).

The most important source of instrumental inaccuracy in ICP-OES is
the spectral inferences derived from the plasma. The interferences are
likely to occur in the analysis of trace REY in coal ash having complex
chemical compositions. Especially, the concentrations of Fe, Ca, K, Na,
Ti, and Ba in coal ash are several orders of magnitude higher than the
REY contents, which may result in the total or partial overlap of analyte
(REY) with the interfering species’ lines [187]. Eze. et al. [186] carried
out  a  comparative  study  of  REY  determination  in  coal  fly  ash  using
INAA, ICP-OES, XRF, and ICP-MS. Based on analysis of the NIST stan-
dard coal fly ash 1633b and a South African fly ash, the authors found
that REY contents in coal ash determined by ICP-OES are much lower
than those by INAA and ICP-MS (Table 6). This is probably caused by the
spectra interference or problems occurring in sample preparation pro-
cess  (such  as  incomplete  digestion).  The  selection  of  appropriate
analytical line and use software for spectra recognition are important to
avoid
the
ion/cation-exchange separation used for matrix elimination in compli-
cated geological samples can be applied to REY determination in coal
ash [187–189].

creates  similar  improvements  in  mass  spectrometry  techniques  [197,
198]. In comparison to ICP-OES, ICP-MS shows several advantages: (i)
lower detection limits (at ppt level); (ii) wider linear response ranges (up
to nine orders of magnitude); (iii) much faster in simultaneous deter-
mining multi-elements; (iv) simpler spectra that can avoid matrix sep-
aration. Overall, ICP-MS is a better choice for REY determination in coal
ash than that of ICP-OES, but the high costs would limit its use in some

To obtain accurate and reliable data, several shortcomings of ICP-MS
should be considered including the mass spectral interferences and its
intolerance to high contents of dissolved solids (matrix effects) in solu-
tions. For REY analysis, the spectral interferences may arise from the
formation  of  oxide  and  hydroxide  ions  in  the  ICP  segment.  Table  7
summarizes potential spectral inferences species on REY ions in ICP-MS
system. As shown in Table 7, the formation of REE oxide ions (REEO
)
especially  the  occurrence  of  LREEO
(with  higher  ionization  energy)
that maybe generated from the high-temperature plasma can interfere
with  the  determination  of  the  HREE,  such  as  143NdO
,

144SmO
. Fortunately, the yield of

is  only  a  few  thousandths  or  lower;  and  therefore,  in-
on  HREE  can  be  neglected  due  to  the  lower

concentrations of individual REY (at ~ μg g-1  level) in coal ash. How-
ever, as Si-rich materials, the determination of Sc in coal ash by ICP-MS
may be plagued by spectral interferences from the ash matrix constitu-
ents such as Si and Ca, Li and B if using lithium metaborate or borate flux
as fusion reagents to digest the ash samples [190]. Li et al. [377] re-
ported that the interferences of B and Ca on Sc analysis are negligible
when the B and Ca content is below 100 and 200 μg mL-1  in the final
solution  for  ICP-MS  analysis.  In  terms  of  Si-based  interferences,  the
employment  of  high-resolution  ICP-MS  [376],  algebraic  corrections
[377], and collision/reaction cell technique [190] during the determi-
nation of Sc in siliceous rocks by ICP-MS can be referred to overcome the
polyatomic  interferences.  In  addition,  the  interferences  of  Ba-bearing

on 151Eu
on 153Eu
is another problem which must
be eliminated if the ash contains high Ba contents [198,199]. Yan et al.
[172] used an AG50W-x8 cation resin to separate Ba species from the
acid digestion solution of coal fly ash samples. Precision and accuracy of
their procedure have been demonstrated by repeat analyses of National
Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) standard references of coal and
fly ash samples. The authors also proposed a ratio of Ba/Eu (1000) as
basis for evaluation of the interference of Ba on Eu. If Ba/Eu > 1000,

then Ba in coal fly ash can greatly interfere with Eu determination, and
measures should be taken to diminish the interferences [172].

The use of sector-field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrom-
etry  (SF-ICP-MS)  in  high  resolution  mode  maybe  an  effective  way  to
reduce the polyatomic interferences occurring in quadruple inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Q-ICP-MS). Thompson et al. [200]
carried out a comparative analysis of REE in a series of coal-based wastes
by Q-ICP-MS and SF-ICP-MS. As revealed, Q-ICP-MS can handle most of
geological materials, including coal ash for the determination of REY;
whilst, for ash samples containing large amounts of Ba (Ba/Eu > 1000),
SF-ICP-MS may be suitable to accurately determine all REY (especially
Eu). Other methods that have been used to overcome the spectral in-
terferences  for  environmental  samples  and  geological  matrices,
including: measure bivalent ions (Eu2+
) [201], use of algebraic correc-
tions [202–204], optimize instrumental parameters (ICP power, carrier
gas flow rate, among others) [205–208], and apply de-solvation tech-
niques  [204,209].  These  methods  could  be  potential  solutions  to  the
accurate analysis of REY in coal fly ash. In addition, both matrix effects
and  spectral  interferences  for  ICP-MS  greatly  depend  on  the  sample
introduction  techniques  employed.  The  pneumatic  nebulization  for

polytetra-fluoroethylene (PTFE) as a chemical modifier to promote REY
vaporization,  solid  coal  fly  ash  sample  (< 325  mesh)  was  directly
introduced into the ETV system, vaporized in a graphite furnace, and
was carried into ICP torch for ionization. Their results revealed that the
spectral interferences of matrix elements including Al, Fe, Si, Na, K, Ca,
Mg, and Ba on REE were reduced with sample introduction by ETV.

Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA)

Instrumental  Neutron  activation  analysis  (INAA)  is  a  robust  tech-
nique to detect trace elements (including rare earth elements) in coal
and coal ash. The working principal of INAA was built upon the nuclear
reactions, where the half-life of radioactive isotopes and the γ-ray en-
ergy of each elements are unique and can be used as “fingerprint”  for
elemental identification and quantification [210,211]. It generally in-
volves: (1) activation process, involving irradiation of the stable isotopes
of one element in the sample by thermal neutrons, (2) decay process,
involving emission of different types of ionizing radiations during the
decay of the radioactive isotopes, and (3) detection of the radiation, such
as the β-radiation, γ-radiation, and sometimes determine the decay rate
of  the  radioactive  nuclei.  Accordingly,  the  overall  test  time  for  INAA
analysis  requires  several  weeks,  much  longer  than  other  instruments
[198]. This is one of main drawbacks of INAA analysis. Besides, the use
of  INAA  have  several  other  disadvantages:  (1)  it  suffers  from
time-consuming  procedures,  interferences  of  major  elements  in  the
samples, and high costs of operation [198]; and (2) it cannot analyze the
full suite of REY, because the low γ-ray energies for detecting Er and Tm,
low sensitivity to neutrons activated from Ho and Y, and no stable Pr
isotopes.

The  major  advantages  of  INAA  are  also  obvious:  (1)  it  is  a  non-
destructive  analysis  technique,  material  remains  intact;  (2)  sample
preparation is very simple, i.e., drying and weighing mg of test samples
without  chemical  treatment  (e.g.,  dissolution);  (3)  it  allows  simulta-
neous analysis of ~40 radionuclides; (4) a very sensitive technique can
determine elements at μg g-1  and sub-μg g-1  concentrations. Therefore,
INAA has been used for the development and certification of reference
materials  at  national  organizations,  such  as  the  National  Institute  of
Standards and Technology (NIST).

INAA has been widely used to detect trace elements (including rare
earth elements) in coal-related materials [150]. For REY determination
in coal ash, Tu et al. [212] determined eight rare earth elements (La, Ce,
Nd, Eu, Tb, Dy, Yb, and Sc) in a Chinese coal fly ash by the means of
INAA using NIST SRMs 1632a as multi-element standards. In their study

[212], the procedure in the INAA analysis involved both short and long
irradiations with thermal neutron flux (24 h), the decay of the radio-
nuclides (3 weeks), and the measurement of the gamma-ray by a Ge (Le)
detector (4 h). Besides, the γ-ray lines of  169Yb overlap with  182Ta at
179.5 keV and 160Tb with 131Ba at 215.8 keV. Thus, INAA cannot be used
in routine analysis for most laboratories with such a long measurement
period accompanying high costs and long time. Nevertheless, due to its
high  sensitivity  and  ability  of  multi-elemental  and  non-destructive
analysis,  INAA  has  been  used  as  one  of  the  principal  reference
methods to determine REY in coal ash [32,186,213]. For example, in the
DOE-supported  REE  characterization  projects  [140],  to  evaluate  the
precision  and  accuracy of  the  ICP-based  REE  determination  methods,
one laboratory applied INAA as the reference method. As illustrated in
Table 6, INAA had the best performance in determining REE in coal ash
with  average  REE  recovery  approaching  100%.  Wagner  et  al.  [32]
gained comparable values of six REEs (Sc, La, Ce, Eu, Sm, and Tb) in five
South African coal fly ash samples analyzed by INAA to that of ICP-MS.

3.1.5. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis

In  addition  to  INAA,  XRF  is  another  nondestructive  method  for
determining REY in the solid ash. It is usually used for analysis of major
elements  in  geological  and  environmental  materials  [214].  Some  re-
searchers, for examples, Kuhn et al. [215] and Prather et al. [216] tried
to  extend this technique  to trace  elements  analysis  in coal.  The main
advantages of XRF are: (1) in situ analysis of elements without sample
preparation, such ashing, milling, pelletization, or digestion; and thus,
the overall measurement time is shorter and less expensive relative to
other instrumental techniques; (2) simultaneous analysis of both major
and  minor  components;  (3)  covering  wide  ranges  from  < 1  μg  g-1  to
100%;  and  (4)  it  is  a  common  laboratory  instrument  and  therefore
readily accessible. Therefore, XRF plays an important role in geochem-
ical  survey  and  environmental  monitoring  because  of  simple  sample
preparation process and quick measurements of multi-element within a
few minutes [217,218]. Depending upon the detector types, there are
general two XRF techniques, i.e., energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry  (EDXRF)  and  wavelength-dispersive  X-ray  fluorescence
spectrometry (WDXRF). For quantitative analysis, WDXRF shows better
performance in analysis of trace REY in solid materials, including coal
ash [219–221]. However, several problems occur in REY determination
by XRF:

• Sample matrix effects (Absorption/enhancements)
• Spectral interferences
• Low sensitivity
• Sample homogeneity and size effects

Therefore, the use of XRF techniques for quantifying REY in coal ash
is not as popular as other three instrumental methods (Fig. 8). For REY

B. Fu et al.

analysis in coal ash, the most serious problems of WDXRF are probably
matrix effects and overlapping of the analytical lines. For example, the
signals  of  HREE  in  coal  ash  may  be  weakened  (absorption  effects)
because of the absorption of X-rays by light rare earth elements or other
major elements in coal ash. In a study by Eze et al. [186], only Sc, La, and
Ce were detected by XRF due to no suitable standards for calibration.
Table 8 listed the possible interfering lines in the XRF analysis of REY in
coal ash. Smoli ́nski et al. [219] developed a method for the quantifica-
tion analysis of REE based on WDXRF. The matrix effects and spectra
interferences during REY determination are corrected by calibration and
peak  de-convolution  of  the  overlapping  spectral  lines.  Based  on  the
analysis of 16 REY in 12 different coal combustion ash and eight certi-
fied reference materials, the relative standard deviations (RSD) and the
recoveries of most REY in the standard ash samples are estimated to be
2.1-12.9% and < 10%, respectively. However, the recovery rates of Tb
(21.8%), Dy (21.8%), and Er (20.1%) in the standard ash are not satis-
fied. This is mainly caused by the lower concentrations of HREE in coal
ash and thus the Lα  lines (2θ  angles of Tb and Dy: 56-58
) are easily

Portable XRF is generally used as a screening tool in field geological
and environmental investigations, for rapidly determining the elemental
compositions  of  ores,  rocks,  sediments,  etc.,  [222–227].  To  quickly
identify REY-rich coal or coal ash in the U.S. coalfield and power plants,
Bryan et al. [218] studied the use of a portable hand-held XRF to esti-
mate the concentrations of REY. Generally, the results of LREE content
obtained from the portable XRF units could be correlated to the labo-
ratory  quantitative  analysis,  with  a  correlation  coefficient  of  0.878.
Thus, it can be used to screen likely samples for submission to the lab-
oratory.  The  accuracy,  however,  is  not  quantitatively  reliable.  For
example, the detected Y contents in the NIST 1633c via the portable XRF
were 5-7 times higher than the certified values.

Overall,  a  general  conclusion  can  be  reached  is  that  the  main
analytical  techniques  have  been  used  for  REY  determination  in  last
twenty years are ICP-MS, ICP-OES, INAA, and XRF (Fig. 8). A compar-
ison  of  these  analytical  methods  in  REY  determination  in  coal  ash  is
summarized in Table 9. Coal ash usually contains low concentration of
individual  REY  (sub-μg  g-1  to  μg  g-1  range)  and  the  major  chemical
components and inorganic salts could bring matrix effects, spectral in-
terferences,  and  other  instrumental  problems  for  the  four  analytical
techniques.  ICP-MS  is  recommended for  determining REY  in  coal  ash
because of its high sensitivity, multi-elemental capability, and reason-
able costs. The measurement of REY, especially low content HREE by
ICP-MS is critical because ICP-MS can directly determine the digestion

solutions  without  separation  and  pre-concentration  procedure.  As
mentioned in 3.1.3, in terms of HREE determination, several methods
can overcome the spectral interferences during the ICP-MS analysis of
HREY  in  coal  ash  digestion  solutions:  i)  monitoring  the  isobaric  REE
interferences from oxides of lighter REE (La, Ce, Pr and Nd)) or other
elements (BaO and BaOH) on the HREE, for example using the mass ratio
of CeO/Ce or ThO/Th, and the value should be kept < 2%, ii) the use of
collision cell by introducing pure gas (such as helium) to eliminate the
polyatomic and doubly-charged interferences, iii) algebraic correction
that  can  be  used  to  reduce  overlapped  spectra  lines,  for  example  the
interference  of  PrO  and  NdO  on  Gd  and  Tb.  In  contrast,  pre-
concentration and matrix separation might be necessary prior to ICP-
OES analysis (especially for HREE), for the coal ash containing REY at
normal  concentration  level  (contents  of  total  REY  below  300  μg  g-1).
Further work should develop workable pretreatment methods to over-
come these problems. INAA could be a reference method for assessing
the precision and accuracy in determination of REY by other techniques.
XRF, as a rapid and nondestructive method for analysis of solid sample,
is suitable for exploring REE-rich coal ash in field survey.

3.2. Speciation analysis

3.2.1.

Indirect methods

Speciation  of  REY  in  coal  ash  assists  in  understanding  their  parti-
tioning behavior in coal combustion process and inform REY recoveries
strategies [26,229–232]. Methods that are used to measure REY occur-
rences  in  coal  ash  can  be  classified  into  indirect  methods  and  direct
methods  (Fig.  7).  Indirect  methods  refer  to  applying  the  method  of
statistical calculations, physical separations, and chemical leaching to
gaining the affinities of REY to special components of coal ash.

Statistical  calculation  can  provide  preliminary  but  limited  REY
speciation  information  [18,20,22,121,170,175,180].  Physical  separa-
tion such as float-sink and magnetic separations are methods for REY
separation from bulk fly ash [12,23,33,108,121,170,175,176,179,185].
These
indirect  methods  are  more  used  for  beneficiation  and
pre-concentration of REY from fly ash for the further extraction, having
few implications for REY occurrences. The detailed descriptions can be
referred  to section 7. Here, we will focus on making a review on the
chemical leaching methods, since it is an effective process to quantify
REY speciation and have implications for REY extraction from coal ash.
Sequential chemical extraction (SCE) has been extensively used for
determining trace elements associations in coal fly ashes. As shown in
Table  10,  numerous  sequential  leaching  protocols  were  designed  to
study the REY speciation in coal ash [16,20,27,108,121,145,159,163,
171,176,196,233,234]. In these leaching procedurals, REY associations
can generally be classified into three types:

■ Easily-leached fraction: including the water-soluble, ion-exchange-
able, and weak acid-soluble forms, which can be easily released with
mild regents such as deionized water, ammonium acetate, magne-
sium chloride, dilute HCl, acetic acid, and sodium acetate, etc.;
■  Metal-oxide  bound  fractions  and  organic/sulfide  forms:  including
Fe/Mn-oxides, crystalline Fe/Al-oxides forms, amorphous Fe oxides-
bound,  crystalline  Fe  oxides-bound,  and  organic/sulfide-bound;
dissolution  of  these  REE-bearing  forms  requires  relatively  strong
acid or chelating agents (e.g., oxalic acid); and

■  Insoluble  forms  or  residual  forms:  strong  acid/alkaline  digestion

methods as indicated in 3.1.1 are necessary for REY leaching.

The major problems of SCE process may arise from the assumption
that  each  chemical  reagent  reacts  with  a  special  REY-bearing  phase.
However,  this  might  be  not  true  in  many  cases  because  REY  can  be
leached  from  multiple  phases  by  one  kind  of  reagent  [145]; and  sec-
ondary reactions (e.g. re-adsorption, precipitation, and re-dissolution)
may  occur  in  the  leaching  steps.  Therefore,  it  is  suggested  that  each
step of the SCE process should be theoretically and/or experimentally

verified. As shown in Table 10, Liu et al. [145] proposed a three-step
sequential acid leaching procedure for discerning REY associations in
coal ash. The procedure was validated by (1) the acid leaching experi-
ments with REY reference compounds and (2) the thermodynamic pre-
diction  of  solubility  of  REE  pure  compounds  at  varying  pH  by
geochemical  software  PHREEQC.  This  procedure  may  be  suitable  to
quantify REY occurrences in fly ashes. Note that the predicted dissolu-
tion curve of some REE-bearing phases by PHREEQC, for example the
complete dissolution of monazite at pH = 1.0 seems to be unrealistic
[229]. As indicated by Liu et al. [145], the ash compositions, particle
size, and  physical distribution of REY-bearing minerals can affect the
REY dissolution kinetics. To this end, a reliable and convincing quanti-
fication  of  REY  species  in  fly  ash  by  sequential  leaching  methods  re-
quires cross-validation using direct techniques.

3.2.2. Direct microanalysis methods

In recent years, to develop effective REY recovery techniques, there
are a number of studies working on in-situ identifying and quantifying
REY speciation in coal fly ash by advanced instrumental analysis [122,
144–147,192,230–233,235–238]. As summarized in Fig. 7, these direct
methods are generally divided into:

■  Instrumental  microanalysis  techniques:  laser-ablation  ICP-MS  (LA-
ICP-MS),  secondary  ion  mass  spectrometry  (SIMS;  also  called  ion
microprobe analysis);

■  Electron microscopy techniques: scanning electron microscopy and
energy-dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy  (SEM-EDS),  electron  probe
micro  analysis  (EPMA),  focused  ion  beam  and  scanning  electron
microscopy (FIB-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
related  techniques,  including  selected  area  electron  diffraction
(SAED),  fast  Fourier  transform  (FFT),  and  electron  energy  loss
spectroscopy (EELS); and

■  Synchrotron-based techniques: X-ray absorption near edge structure
(XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), micro-
probe  X-ray  fluorescence  spectroscopy  (μXRF),  micro-XANES
(μXANES), and micro-EXAFS (μEXAFS)

SEM-EDS  can  be  used  to  determine  REY  occurrences  in  fly  ash
powder or polished pellet. REY-bearing phases usually appear to be very
bright in the ash pellets at backscattered mode, since the brightness of
the backscattered imaging depended on the average atomic number of
the material. As a result,  SEM-EDS is capable of finding discrete REY
minerals that are dispersed in coal ash [122,144,147,192,236]. EPMA is
similar in scope to the SEM method, and one of the main differences
between the two methods is that element concentrations can be accu-
rately  quantified  by  the  wavelength  dispersive  spectrometry  (WDS).
EPMA  has  significantly  lower  detection  limits  (~0.01wt.%)  for  REY
relative to EDS (~0.1wt.%) and is thus more capable of determining the
dispersed occurrences of REY in trace phases [146,147,192]. However,
the bulk analysis indicated that the concentration of individual REY in
coal ash is generally less than 100 μg g-1, especially for some low-content
HREE  being  far  beyond  the  detectability  of  EPMA.  In  addition,  REY
mineral  phases  are  very  complicated,  one  single  particle  (several

microns  in  diameter)  may  contain  nanoscale  multiple  REE-bearing
phases  [144,233].  Detailed  and  accurate  information  on  trace  REY
phase in coal ash can be obtained with TEM and other micro-scale mass
spectrometric techniques.

TEM and related techniques to determine REY occurrences in fly ash
have been extensively used by Hower et al. [122,144,192,231,233,236].
Electron microscopic examination of coal ash by SEM-EDS and EPMA
lays  foundation  for  the  use  of  these  advanced  techniques.  After  the
SEM-EDS survey of a small quantity of coal ash, REE-rich particles are
identified  and  localized,  then  the  individual  minerals  or  mineral  as-
semblages  of  interest  can  be  isolated  and  extracted  through  in  situ
Focused  Ion  Beam  (FIB)  technology.  Following  FIB  extraction,  the
lift-out samples are mounted on a Cu grid and ion milled to 100 nm or
less for the TEM analysis. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) is
employed for mineralogy identification of the selected grains; and fast
Fourier transform (FFT), computed by image analysis software, is used
to  determine  the  lattice  spacing  in  HRTEM  micrographs.  Chemical
identification in TEM is available in some units via electron energy loss
spectroscopy  (EELS)  and  EDS.  A  detailed  procedural  is  presented  in
Fig. 9.

The microanalysis based on mass spectrometric techniques has been
widely used in trace element geochemistry study of inorganic minerals
and rocks [239–243]. A major difference in these microanalysis tech-
niques  is  the  rate  and  depth  of  penetration  within  the  sample.  In
LA-ICP-MS, solid samples are ablated with a laser source to tens of mi-
crometers in a matter of seconds. Accordingly, LA-ICP-MS is useful in
detecting  compositional  variation  with  sample  depth.  Application  of
LA-ICP-MS to coal ash aims principally at quantifying the spatial dis-
tribution and association of elements in coal fly ash. Spears [244], Bauer
et al. [245], and Kostova et al. [246] used LA-ICP-MS [244] to determine
the  major  element  contents  in  epoxy-mounted  coal  fly  ash  samples.
Piispanen  et  al.  [246]  compared  the  LA-ICP-MS  results  of  major  ele-
ments in fly ash samples to the results by SEM-EDS, finding a consistent
result  between  the  two  methods.  Trace  elements  of  environmental
concern, such as As, Se, and Pb, have been successfully determined in fly
ash pellets by LA-ICP-MS, as reported by Spears [244]. For REY deter-
mination, Hood et al. [192] applied LA-ICP-MS to determine the con-
centration of Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm in a set of fly ash samples
derived from Kentucky Fire Clay coal using NIST SRMs 610, 612, and
614 as calibration standards. The matrix and the homogeneity of NIST
reference  materials  differ  from  that  of  fly  ash  so  that  the  results  are
semi-quantitative.  Thompson  et  al.  [237,247]  explored  the  use  of
varying laser spot size (32-60 μm) to determine the REY concentration in
coal fly ash. Instead of selecting a specific element as an internal stan-
dard, the quantification of REY in randomly selected laser spots were
achieved by normalizing all elements to 100% against NIST SRM 610
glass reference. The overall average REY concentration of the randomly
ablated spots in NIST SRM 1633b is comparable to the certified values.
Recent studies have tried to use SIMS to discern REY and other rare
metal occurrences in coal ash. For example, like REY, lithium (Li) is also
a critical metal which might be recovered from some coal ash. To gain
insights on the speciation of Li in coal ash, Hu et al. [248] used SIMS to
analyze the distribution of Li in high-Al coal fly ash, using Bi1+
as

or Bi3+

the primary ion beam with a spot size of 0.2 μm. In SIMS, a primary
beam of incident ions sputters secondary ions from the sample at a much
slower rate, typically leading to penetration depths of only about 1-5
μm. Compared to smaller ion microprobes, the SHRIMP-RG (Sensitive
High Resolution Ion Microprobe –  Reverse Geometry) ion microprobe
and other SHRIMP configurations employ a large format magnetic sector
mass spectrometer with high mass resolution, thereby minimizing the
effect  of  isobaric  interferences  in  SIMS  analysis.  Kolker  et  al.  [146]
analyzed  REE  distribution  and  occurrences  within  ash  particles  using
Stanford-USGS  SHRIMP-RG  ion  microprobe.  An  oxygen  negative-ion
beam with spot size of 15 μm was used to quantify eleven REE in 19
US and international coal fly ashes. NIST glass standards (SRM 611 and
613)  were  used  as  internal  standard  for  calibration  and  the  overall
analytical uncertainty for REE was reported to be within 10–20%.

Overall,  microanalysis  techniques  can  provide  important  informa-
tion on REY species and interparticle distribution differences in complex
ash  matrices.  SEM-EDX  and  EPMA  are  the  most  common  techniques
used  for  geochemistry  study  in  many  laboratories  but  have  limited
detection limits and lower resolution (compared to TEM) for analyzing
trace metals in coal ash. For REY determination, these two methods can
be used as preliminary steps for other advanced microscale techniques,
such as TEM, LA-ICP-MS, and SIMS. In both LA-ICP-MS and SIMS, they
have appropriate detection limits at the μg g-1 to sub-μg g-1 level, which
is  important  to  characterize  grain-scale  REY  distribution  in  coal  ash.
However,  a  major  problem  of  these  two  methods  is  obtaining  a  cali-
bration standard which should be: (1) homogenous on a grain scale, (2)
a  good  matrix  match  to  the  material  being  analyzed,  and  (3)  avoid
spectral interferences of other isotopes [239,244,249]. In addition, the
working spot size of LA-ICP-MS or SIMS might be too large to distinguish
REY associations in the fly ash particles. These large-scale techniques
gloss over the actual mineral and (potentially) non-mineral associations
at nanoscale.  TEM and  related techniques, such as  SAED can provide
more details of REY occurrences in the nanoscale examination, which is
an important supplement to the association of REY in coal fly ash.

3.2.3. Synchrotron-based techniques

Synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy-based analysis is another powerful
technique to discern the speciation of REY in coal ash. For those ele-
ments of relatively high abundance in fly ash samples (such as La, Ce,
Nd, and Y), X-ray absorption spectroscopy of a fly ash sample can be
used to assess bulk-level element speciation. For example, bulk XANES
has been used to identify major phases of Ce and Y, primarily through
linear  combination  fitting  (LCF)  models  of  the  sample  spectrum  with
spectra of reference compounds [145,232,233]. The analyses generate
relative percentages of the element as different reference species. This
approach generally requires careful selection  of known reference  ma-
terials that could be reasonable approximations of the elemental forms
in fly ash. Thus, the selection of reference materials must consider the
conditions of fly ash formation and collection. The selection process can
be  especially  challenging  if  the  individual  elements  are  distributed
diffusely within aluminosilicate glasses. In this case, the localized co-
ordination  state  of  REY  is  not  readily  represented  by  a  commercially
available  material  (see  section  6.4),  and  is  not  easy  to  mimic  in
laboratory-synthesized materials.

The utility of XANES analyses is often limited by the relatively high
concentration requirements of the method, particularly as coal fly ash is
also  enriched  in  other  elements  that  might  be  interfering  (Table  11).
Quantitative  identification  of  REY  species  also  requires  sufficient  dif-
ferences  in  the  spectral  features  of  candidate  reference  compounds,
which are difficult to achieve. In a previous application of yttrium K-
edge  XANES  for  coal  fly  ash,  the  spectral  features  of  an  yttrium  car-
bonate  mineral  (Y2(CO3)3•3H2O)  and  monazite  standard  were
remarkably similar to Y-doped glass and monazite reference materials
(Fig. 10). Thus, in the fitting of XANES spectra for coal fly ash samples,
the replacement of one of these references with the other did not sub-
stantially alter the quality of the model fits. These subtleties emphasize

the  need  for  careful  and  cautious  interpretation  of  XANES  results.  In
other  words,  often  the  results  are  limited  to  qualitative  descriptions
rather  than  quantitative  interpretations.  In  addition  to  XANES  tech-
nique, the use of EXAFS spectroscopy can determine the local bonding
environment  of  the  absorber  atom  (~5  Å)  and  provide  structural  in-
formation  such  as  coordination  number  and  bond  distance  that  can
differentiate  compounds  (e.g.,  between  Y-O  and  Y-P  structures)  and
complement results of XANES analysis. However, due to the low REE
concentrations and line inferences, there have been no study for REE in
coal fly ash using EXAFS. Therefore, more work with EXAFS or other
similar bulk elemental  speciation  methods is  required to improve the
determination REE speciation in coal ash.

A  summary  and  comparison  on  the  advantages  and  limitations  of
various methods for determining REY speciation is given in Table 12. As
shown in Table 12, the identification and quantification of REE in coal
ash  is  still  challenging  due  to  low  REY  contents  and  complex  ash
matrices. One should keep in mind that due to the limitations of each
method;  no  single  scale/  technique  can  provide  all  of  the  answers.
Depending on the ash properties (particle size, crystallinity, REY con-
tents, and among others), readers should be cautious to the speciation
results  derived  from  different  analytical  techniques.  Comprehensive
results  from  both  indirect  and  direct  methods  are  recommended  for
studies on the speciation of REY in coal ash.

4. Concentrations and valuation of REY in coal ash

4.1. REY concentrations in world coal ash

In the review by Ketris and Yudovich [82], the average REY content
in the world coal ashes is estimated to be 404.5 μg g-1, approximately
three-times greater than that in the earth’s crust (180.9 μg g-1). How-
ever,  the  results  from  Ketris  and  Yudovich  [82]  were  the  equivalent
value of REY in coal on an ash basis, rather than the determined values
in real coal combustion ash produced at power plants. In order to better
evaluate  the  reserve  of  REY  from  the  existing  coal  combustion  ash,
current study compiled data of 581 ash samples derived from different
coal-fired  power  plants  in  15  countries  (Table  13).  Considering  the
number of samples available from each country, six countries including

Spain, England, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland are in the group
of Europe; and four countries including South Africa, India, South Korea,
and  Indonesia  are  classified into  the  group  of  “other  countries”.  As  a
result, the average concentration of REY in world coal ash is estimated to
be 435.45 μg g-1, slightly higher than the reported value by Ketris and
Yudovich [82]. Coal ash of China (473 μg g-1) and the U.S. (459.61 μg
g-1) contains higher contents of REY than that of Europe (278.65 μg g-1)
and other countries (298 μg g-1). This might be caused by the limited
number of samples from these two regions, where no data is available on
the  coal  ash  generated  from  the  combustion  of  coals  containing  high
REY contents. The rare earth oxides (REO) have been used as a proxy for
estimating the abundance of metals in ores. Some coal ash, for example,
fly ash from Eastern Kentucky pulverized-coal fired power plants [250]
has  been  reported  to  have  extremely  high  REE  concentrations
(1202-1667  μg  g-1),  comparable  to  the  REO  content  of  some  conven-
tional  REE  ores,  such  as  the  ion-adsorbing  type  rare  earth  ores  and
low-grade hydrothermal ores associated with alkaline igneous activities.

4.2. REY contents in coal ash from major coal-producing countries

4.2.1. Contents and spatial distribution

The  concentration  of  REY  in  coal  ash  is  largely  dependent  on  the
geological origin of the parent coal. The burning of coal from some coal-
hosted ore deposits can further enrich REY in coal ash and may produce
the potential “artificial REY ores” (REY-rich coal ash). Thus, prioritiza-
tion of ash sources for REY recovery requires a detailed knowledge on
REY concentrations of different types of coal ash from different origins
or  regions.  The  information  is  also  vital  in  order  to  explore  possible
strategies  to  leach  REY  from  the  ash  during  recovery  operations  and
understand the potential valuation of the coal ash with respect to the
REY reserves. In view of this, previous findings in the published litera-
ture are summarized and discussed in the review, with emphasis on ash
samples from U.S. and Chinese power plants as two examples.

Extensive  analysis  of  REY  contents  has  been  performed  on  ash
samples from U.S. power plants (Table 13). Taggart et al. [16] made a
broad survey study of REY contents in over 100 U.S. coal fly ash samples
produced from coals from three major coal basins, namely the Appala-
chian basin, Illinois basin, and Powder River basin (Fig. 11A). The total

REY content and trends in the U.S. fly ashes are:

■  REY  contents  differed  significantly  by  coal  basins,  showing  a
(cid:0) 1) > Illi-
(cid:0) 1) > Powder River coal ash (337 μg

decreasing order of Appalachian basin coal ash (591 μg g
nois Basin coal ash (403 μg g
(cid:0) 1);
g

■ Relative  to  the  UCC,  REY  distribution  pattern  of  coal  fly  ash  dis-
played  different  enrichment  modes  among  the  three  basins,  sug-
gesting the characterization of REY in coal ash mainly inherited from
the feed coals.

Afterwards, fly ash samples from burning Illinois basin and Powder
River basin have been detailed investigated by Hower et al. [251] and
Huang et al. [120], respectively. The results confirmed the REY contents
for Illinois Basin coal-sourced and Powder River basin coal-sourced fly
ashes were less than those of Central Appalachian coal-sourced fly ashes.
Meanwhile, a scattered distribution of the REY in coals of each region is
also  observed  due  to  the  mine-to-mine  variations  of  REY  contents  in
parent coals and the varying combustion conditions.

For Chinese coal ashes, compiled data from published literature on
REY concentrations from different provinces and/or regions from China
is discussed. A total of 227 sets of data related to REY analysis (including
11 samples from the first author’s laboratory) were collected from 14
provinces or cities in China [24,25,27,28,93,117,119,161,169,178–180,
252,253]. The spatial distribution of REY contents in coal ashes among
different provinces or cities of China is compared (Fig. 12).

Based on the available data and the geographic locations, provinces
with different REY concentrations in coal ashes can be divided into three
zones (Fig. 12). The total REY differed among these zones, following the
decreasing order of Zone I (623.5 μg g-1) > Zone II (430.9 μg g-1) > Zone
III (318.6 μg g-1). Zone I consists of four provinces or cities located in
southwestern China (Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Guizhou). This
is consistent with the distribution of REY contents in Chinese coal basins,
where feed coals mined from the southwestern China are rich in REY.
Zone II consists of five provinces from central China (Shanxi, Shandong,
Henan,  Hubei,  and  Anhui);  and  one  province  from  southern  China
(Guangdong province) is also included, because the feed coal for power
generation  is  mainly  derived  from  the  central  regions  (e.g.,  Shanxi

not significantly enriched in the coal ashes from Zone III. This is prob-
ably caused by (i) the “mineralized coal” from Zone III not fed into the
utility boilers at the time of sampling and (ii) insufficient published data
related to the abundances of REY in the coal ashes from this region.

4.2.2. Critical REY ratios

In addition to the total REY concentration, the ratio of critical rare
earth element (selected MREY and HREY) is another important param-
eter  influencing  the  potential  values  of  rare  earth  ores.  As  shown  in
Table 13, the average ratio of critical REY (Nd, Eu, Tb, Dy, Y, and Er) in
the world coal ash is 36%, which is higher than some conventional REY
ores.  Accordingly,  coal  ashes  that  are  enriched  in  critical  REY  would
provide alternative sources to the conventional rare earth ores.

Similar to  the  REY contents, the  critical REY  fraction also  heavily
depends on the origins of feed coal. For the U.S. coal ashes, the critical
REY fraction was greatest for the Appalachian basin and Illinois basin-
sourced  coal  ashes  (Fig.  11B)  than  ashes  from  Powder  River  basin.
There are no statistically differences in the critical REY ratios between
Appalachian basin and Illinois basin coal ashes [16].

The ratio of critical REY in different zones in China is displayed in
Fig. 13.  The data demonstrated  that the  critical  REY  content differed
significantly among the three regions (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.005).
Ashes from Zone II had higher critical REY ratios than those from Zone I
(median difference of 3.4%) and Zone III (median difference of 7.3%).
Regardless  of  the  differences,  the  ratio  of  critical-to-excessive  REY  of
Chinese coal ashes is higher than that of selected conventional REE ores
currently being mined, such as the super large Bayan Obo Fe-REE-Nb ore
deposit in Inner Mongolia of China (< 10% critical REY). As shown in

province). REY concentrations in coal ashes from Zone II are much lower
than those of Zone I. Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions,
as two important coal producing areas located in the Northeastern and
Northwestern  China  are  grouped  into  Zone  III.  Although  some  coals
from Inner Mongolia, such as REY-rich Pennsylvanian coals from Jungar
and Daqingshan coalfields are reported to have high concentration of
REY [254], the compiled results at present study suggest that REY are

the UCC normalization curve of REY in coal ash, REY in coal combustion
ash  show  a  medium-  and  heavy-  REY  distribution  pattern,  which  is
different from the typical REE ores (LREE rich type).

Overall, both of the total REY and critical REY contents are mainly
determined by the origin of feed coals. Coal ash samples produced in U.
S. and China would provide three times the critical REY of total REY
extracted per kg than that of conventional ores. The high fraction of in
coal ash may represent a major advantage over the conventional ores if
the  extraction  costs  per  kg  of  can  match  that  of  REE  mining  and
extraction.

4.3. Estimation of REY reserves and economic value

4.3.1. Reserve of REY in coal ash

The “workable reserve” of REY in coal combustion ash depends not
only on their concentration but also on the quantity of available ash. In
the United States, around 59.6% of the 45.7 Mt of coal combustion ash
produced  annually  in  the  US  is  beneficially  reused,  whereas  the
remainder was generally discarded [255]. Taggart et al. [16] estimated

that the annual production of REO in unused portion of coal fly ash was
4000 t for the Appalachian Basin, 1280 t for the Illinois basin, and 3630 t
for the Powder River basin. The unused fly ash comprises a REY reserve
that is similar in scale to the annual production of REY at the Mountain
Pass mine (4769 tons in 2014).

China  is  the  world’s  largest  consumer  of  coal,  with  annual  usage
surpassing that of the US, Japan, and European Union combine [256].
Annual amount of generated combustion residual from thermal power
plant is huge. In 2017, about 70% of 686 Mt was reused for beneficial
purposes  [257].  The  remainder  is  disposed  in  landfills  and  thus  the
annual ash production plus the fly ash already in storage constitute a
huge potential REY resource. Based on Taggart et  al. [16], this study
made  a  similar  assessment  of  REY  reserves  in  the  unused  coal  ash
annually produced by Chinese power plants. Assuming that coal-fired
power generation of each provinces mirrors the relative coal ash pro-
duction by region, then the annual total amount of coal ash produced
from the Zone I, Zone II, and Zone III was estimated to be around 32.8,
260.5,  90.0 million  tons, respectively;  and the  amount  of unused ash
accounted for 30% of the total ash, that is, 9.8 million tons for Zone I,

literature [24,25,27,28,93,117,119,161,169,178–180,252,253].

78.2  million  tons  for  Zone  II,  and  27.0  million  tons  for  Zone  III
(Table 13).

4.3.2. Valuation of REY in coal ash

Based on the data in Table 14, the annual total tonnage of REO in the
discarded  coal  ash  is  estimated  to  be  8029  t  for  the  southwestern
provinces of Zone I, 42,114 t for the central provinces of Zone II, and
9769 t for Zone III, respectively. If all of REO in the unused coal ash is
extracted, the total amount could be around 59,909 t (Table 14). This
coal  ash  reserve  of  REO  annually  (the  year  of  2019)  produced  from
China power plants is nearly half of the annual China REY mine pro-
duction (132 thousand Mt of REO in 2019; Data sources: https://www.
statista.com/statistics/268011/top-countries-in-rare-earth-mine-pr
oduction/).  According  to  the  2020  prices  for  REO  (http://www.reht.
com/h-nd-426.html),  the  total  value  of  the  REO  in  the  discarded  ash
reserve from China is estimated at 14.8 billion yuan (Table 15), which is
equivalent to U.S. 2.2 billion dollars based on the annual average ex-
change rate of Chinese Yuan to US dollar (0.15 USD). The REY value in
Chinese  coal  ash  is  lower  than  that  of  US  coal  ash  as  estimated  by
Taggart et al. (4.3 billion dollars) [16]. Main reasons are the large var-
iations of REY prices with time, different REY contents (especially crit-
ical REY) and Sc is excluded from the valuation due to insufficient Sc
data in coal ash. Note that only a part of coal ash could be extracted for
rare earths products, as indicated by the large variations of REY con-
centration in different coal ashes [258]. Accordingly, the valuation of
REY reserved in coal ashes is likely smaller since not all of the unused
ash can meet the requirements of being used as extraction sources. Be-
sides  the  total  value,  the  value  of  REO  per  ton  of  coal  ash  was  also
calculated  to  provide  a  basis  for  assessing  the  use  of  coal  ash  as  an
alternative REY source. As shown in Table 15, it is estimated that the
per-ton REO values is 180.1 yuan for Zone I, 111.9 yuan for Zone II, and
66.3 yuan for Zone III. The main contributors to the value of REO are
some of the critical rare earths. The high prices of Nd (374 yuan/kg), Tb
(4950 yuan/kg), and Dy (1950 yuan/kg) contribute to near 70% of the
total value of the whole REY value in coal ash. The result highlights the
importance of the high ratio of critical REY in ash, which is one of the
main advantages over other conventional rare earth ores.

Overall, the value of REY in coal ash primarily depends on several
factors, i.e., the total REY concentration in coal ash, the ratio of critical
REY, the separation technology, and the global market price of REO [18,
281,295]. The valuations will be adjusted, depending upon these factors
especially the extraction techniques that are currently developed. The
costs  for  REY  recovery  from  coal  ash,  such  as  transportation  and
extraction processes, should be scaled regarding the valuation. To add

values and reduce the overall costs, the selection and pre-concentration
of REY-rich coal ash as well as co-extraction of other metals or reuse the
wastes  after  extraction  should  be  considered  and  incorporated  in  the
extraction procedure (see the discussion in section 7). There are huge
amounts of “old ash”  preserved in landfill sites (e.g., ash ponds), that
have  been  accumulating  for  many  years  could  be  a  source  but  is  not
considered  in  the  valuation.  Considering  the  state  of  the  coal-fired
generating  industry  (continues  to  fall)  in  the  developed  countries,
such as in the U.S., this preserved ash would be a more viable resource.
Waste management regulations would additionally drive the scientific
community and relevant enterprises to explore the REY recovery from
coal  ash,  particularly  for  the  REY-rich  ash  disposed  in  potential  agri-
culture lands [16,122].

5. Speciation of REY in coal ash

5.1. Definition and classification of REY forms in coal ash

The combustion of coal in a utility boiler can significantly alter the
speciation of REY in coal. As reviewed in section 3.2, the speciation of
REY in coal ash has been extensively studied by techniques at the bulk
[16,108,230] and micro scales [122,144,146,192,230,233,236]. Glassy
materials,  crystalline  minerals,  and  unburned  carbon  are  the  main
components comprising coal ash. REY have been found to be associated
with these three main phases. Based on the REY chemistry, mineralogy,
and physical distribution within fly ash, the speciation of REY in coal ash
is classified as: amorphous glassy associations; discrete minerals, both
the major REE-bearing minerals and trace associations in other minerals,
or compounds; and organic associations (bound to unburned carbon).
The  third  type  seems  to  be  elusive  with  only  a  few  TEM  cases  study
finding  it  as  inclusions  dispersed  into  the  amorphous  and  graphitic
carbons, so that more studies and evidences are needed to make it clear
and credible (Fig.. 14).

5.2. Associations with amorphous glassy materials

Aluminosilicate  glasses  are  the  dominant  phases  in  coal-derived
Class F fly ashes. A number of studies have indicated that REY associ-
ated with glassy materials in coal ash might be the dominant form [20,
27,121,122,145,146,196,231–233].  As  shown  in  Fig.  15,  correlation
analysis  of  REY  contents  versus  major  elements  contents  in  fly  ashes
found  that  REY  showed  a  positive  correlation  to  SiO2  and  Al2O3.
Sequential  chemical  extraction  studies  on  coal  fly  ash  samples  from
Southwestern  China  [27],  Eastern  United  States  [260],  and  northeast
Spain [171] indicated that more than 70% of REY were hard to leach in
various acid solutions and were considered to be bound with silicates
and aluminosilicates.

Amorphous  Si-Al  glassy  associations  can  be  further  divided  into
those having REY dispersed throughout the whole glass grains and in-
dividual REE-bearing phases that are closely bound with Si-Al glasses
(Fig.  14).  Scale  is  a  key  parameter  to  discern  these  associations  and
various microscale techniques, including SEM-EDS, EPMA, TEM and the
related  techniques,  SIMS,  synchrotron-based  micro  XRF  imaging  and
micro XANES, and among others are necessary for identifying these REY
forms.  REY  dispersed  throughout  the  aluminosilicate  glass  have  been
reported in several instrumental studies. Using Ce as a proxy for all of
the REY, an EPMA study of REY-enriched Kentucky fly ashes by Hower
et al. [238] was conducted, and the WDS mapping observed that REY
were distributed throughout the glassy ash particles, such as Si-Al glassy
cenospheres and frothy glassy particles. Note that at that scale, EPMA
may not tell if the Ce was truly dispersed or in fine minerals. The dis-
tribution of REY in individual fly ash Si-Al glass grains was determined
using the Stanford/USGS SHRIMP-RG ion microprobe [146]. The uni-
form  distribution  of  REY  in  single  aluminosilicate  particles  to  that  of
bulk  fly ash  is  indicative  of  REY partitioning  into  the  aluminosilicate
glasses. In a study by Stuckman et al. [232], a suite of four coal fly ash

and three bottom ash samples derived from the Appalachian basin were
studied  by  synchrotron  micro-X-ray  fluorescence  and  near-edge  ab-
sorption  spectroscopy  (μ-XRF  and  μ-XANES).  The  μ-XRF  mapping
showed that REY were dispersed throughout the aluminosilicate glass in
irregular  shapes  with  large  grain  size  (> 40  μm).  In  another  XANES
study [233], linear combination fits of bulk Y-XANES spectra of nine fly
ashes  from  the  central  Appalachian  basin,  Illinois  basin,  and  Powder
River  basin  found  that  22-76%  of  REE  occur  as  Y-doped  glass.  After
leaching these ash samples with 1M oxalic acid, the bulk ash fits were
dominated by Y-doped glass.

The close association of REY mineral particles with glassy matrices is
another common REY occurrence in fly ash. In the study of Liu et al.
[230],  REY-rich  phosphate  particle  (xenotime  in  ~10  μm  size)  was
observed by SEM-EDS in a US coal-derived fly ash, and the REE minerals
were found to be totally encapsulated or at the edge of Si-Al glasses. In
combination  of  SEM-EDS  and  LA-ICP-MS,  Thompson  et  al.  [237]
observed that small grains (~10 μm) of monazite, zircon, and apatite
were  commonly  embedded  within  Al-Si  glassy  cenospheres,  Al-Si
spheres,  or  other  aluminosilicate  glass  forms  and  the  particle  size  of
these REY-bearing glassy phases was mostly in the range of 50-80 μm
(Fig. 16). Synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence and near-edge absorp-
tion spectroscopy (μ-XRF and μ-XANES) also provided direct evidences
[218]. In their study, Ce hotspots, an area (4–30 μm) denoted by the
yellow to red color on the maps representing high XRF signal intensity,

were mostly found within glass phase (13 out of 19) in μ-XRF maps. In
six  of  13  Ce  hotspots,  the  Ce  hotspots  were  encapsulated  in
irregular-shaped aluminosilicate grains. The co-localization of Ce with
Si, Al, Ca, P, Ti, and Nd suggested that monazite is embedded in glass
phase. Similarly, as a proxy element, Y was found to be co-localized with
a range of elements, including Si, P, Ca, Fe, and other REE by μ-XRF
mapping  techniques  [145,233].  Further  analysis  by  μ-XANES  reveals
REY  phosphates,  REY  oxides,  or  REY  carbonate  making  up  these  Y
hotspots.

The use of TEM and related techniques, such as SAED and EDS can
provide insights into the glass-REY mineral associations. TEM studies of
REY-rich  Kentucky  fly  ash  samples  have  revealed  a  variety  of  REY-
bearing  minerals and  amorphous  phases to  be present within  the  ash
[122,144,192,231,236]. For example, Hower et al. [122] found ~10 nm
xenotime (YPO4) particles included within monazite in the ponded ash
from the burning of eastern Kentucky coal; the composite mineral as-
sembles are within glass. The nanosized REY phosphates within glass
phase  were  further  confirmed  by  X-ray  pattern  of  the  separated  REE
grain after FIB extraction. Fig. 17 illustrates a STEM image of a REY rich
region, EDS mapping showing the La, Ce, and Nd region surrounded by
complex mineral assemblages.

A  mineralogic  examination  of  Fig.  17  particle  is  seen  on  Fig.  18,
where  the  lattice  interlayer  spacing  and  the  diffraction  pattern,  as
derived  from  FFT  and  SAED  indicate  a  Ce  orthophosphate  monazite,
with a monoclinic unit cell. In addition to monazite, xenotime, zircon,
and among other, crichtonite-group minerals, possibly davidite ((Ce,La)
(Y,U)(Ti,Fe)20O38)  or  (Ce,La)(Y,U,  Fe)(Ti,Fe)20(OH,O)38))  were  found
within Si-Al glass in a stoker ash from the combustion of REY-rich coal
(Fig.  19)  [25].  However,  some  REY-rich  areas  have  no  discernable
minerals,  as  indicated  by  SAED  or  FFT  imaging  for  the  crystallinity
[144]. This may indicate that REY disperse into the glassy structures.
The restrictions of the current technique determine that it cannot detect
exceptionally fine minerals, overlapped, and/or disparate mineral grain
orientations if REY present as the complicated forms.

5.3. Associations with discrete minerals or compounds

Discrete  REY-bearing  minerals/compounds  are  another  common
REY  forms  in  coal  ash.  While  aluminosilicate  glass  is  the  main  ash
component, it can be observed that some discrete REY-bearing minerals/

compounds have no contact with the glass phases. In comparison to the
amorphous  glassy  associations  as  noted  above,  discrete  REY  minerals
or/and compounds are not exclusively enclosed within the glassy matrix
of  coal  ash,  showing  certain  independence  from  the  glass  phases
(Fig.  20-21).  Typical  discrete  REY  phosphates,  REY  carbonates,  REY
oxides, REY silicates, REY sulfates, REY-bearing iron oxides, etc., have
been observed in coal fly ashes. By using polarized reflected-light and
oil-immersion optics, Fig. 20 (A) shows a monazite grain in a Kentucky
Fire  Clay  coal-derived  fly  ash,  and  Fig.  20  (B)  illustrates  a  zircon  (a
potential Y source) grain in fly ash from Powder River Basin subbitu-
minous coal-derived fly ash. These two large mineral particles might be
extreme examples of the discrete mineral/compound associations, since
most  REY  particles  in  ash  are  too  small  to  be  observed  using  fly  ash
petrographic methods. Fig. 21 illustrates a EDS mapping result showing
that  discrete  REY-bearing  phosphate  minerals  rhabdophane  (Ce,La)
(PO4•H2O)  and  monazite  (Ce,La,Nd,Th)(PO4,SiO4),  as  well  as  REY-
enriched calcium oxide were identified in a coal fly ash from combus-
tion of coal from a Ohio pulverized coal-fueled power plant. Discrete
pure REY phosphates (~30-μm size) and minor REY contained in lime
have been observed in two US coal fly ashes [147].

Quantification of discrete REY-bearing minerals or compounds in fly
ash is important for evaluation of REE extraction efficiency and some
synchrotron microscopy and spectroscopy may provide some important
information  in  this  aspect  [145,232,233].  The  LCF  of  bulk  Y  XANES
spectroscopy of fly ash from three major coal basins of the U.S. suggest
that bulk ash fits were comprised primarily of Y2O3 (18% to 51%) and
Y-doped glass (22% to 76%) [233]. While in another Y XANES study
[145], no Y-doped glass was detected in the LCF results; instead REY
oxides (35-55%), REY-bearing hematite (20(cid:0) 30%), and REY phosphates
(20(cid:0) 25%) or apatite (20(cid:0) 35%) consisted of the REY species in fly ash.
Both of the bulk Y studies only used Y-doped glass as reference com-
pounds, meaning that REY species closely bound with glassy materials
(e.g., encapsulation or embedding) may not be detected by the method.
This may cause the different fitting results of micro-scale synchrotron
spectroscopy (μ-XANES) of REE hotspots in the same fly ash from that of
bulk XANES. In Liu et al.’s study [145], twelve Y hotspots with particle

in  μXANES  fits  among  Appalachian  basin,  Illinois  basin,  and  Powder
River basin ashes. Results from XANES at both bulk and micro scale can
be  informative  for  knowing  the  speciation  of  REY  in  fly  ash  and
contribute to the confirmation of certain amounts of discrete REY min-
erals  or  compounds  in  fly  ash  but  are  still  challenging  to  provide  a
complete and quantitative information.

5.4. Associations with unburned carbon

Unburned carbon in fly ash has been proved to be important trapper
for many trace metals, such as Hg, As, Se, and among others [262,263].
In a recent study by Hower et al. [264], the froth flotation of fly ashes
collected  from  one  power  plant  burning  Pennsylvanian-age  Kentucky
coal generates low density, C-rich particles. The concentration of REY in
the carbon froth concentrate (512 ppm) is comparable to the feed ash

size from < 10 μm to 50 μm in fly ashes was fitted and the LCF results of
Y μXANES showed that five of the hotspots were identified as REY ox-
ides,  three  as  REY  phosphates  (churchite/xneotime),  one  as  REE  in
Ca-rich  Si-Al  glass,  and  the  rest  had  no  results  because  of  indistin-
guishable LCF data profile. Taggart et al. [233] observed great variations

(464 ppm), indicating that the fly ash carbon may host certain amounts
of  REY.  TEM  studies  found  that  graphitic  and  fullerene-like  carbons,
often containing included/entrained nanoscale minerals and/or metals,
occur in the fly ash resulting from the burning of bituminous coal [122,
192,235,265]. In accordance with the established occurrences of trace
metals with fly ash carbon deposited on aluminosilicate glass particles,
Hower et al. [122] and Hood et al. [192] observed association of REY
with the nanosized carbons by HR-TEM technique. In Hood et al.’s study
[192], a thin-layer carbon shell containing Ce and Nd is noted (Fig. 22).
The nano-sized carbon deposits onto a Si-Al-O glassy sphere. Similarly,
in another study by Hower et al. [122], an complex ash constituent of
Al-Si spheres, Fe-bearing minerals, and unburned carbon can be seen;
the Al-Si glass sphere with an Fe-O core, possibly spinel, is surrounded
by  Ce-Nd-Sm-Y-bearing  graphitic  carbon  (Fig.  23).  The  original  con-
struction implied that the REY are part of the graphite structure. How-
ever, the TEM resolution is still insufficient to distinguish if REY are in
the same particles or occur individually or in varying concentrations.
Fig.  24  shows  a  detailed  view  of  the  graphitic  carbon  at  the  scale  of
10-nm including few-nano-size Ce and Fe particles [235]. The sample is
a C-rich concentrate product produced by the froth flotation of a fly ash.
Note that the locations of the Ce Lβ peaks are close to that of the La, Pr,
Sm,  and  Gd  peaks,  which  cannot  be  discerned  by  the  software.  It  is
suggested that these REY might also be present in the particles [235].

In addition to the association of metals with carbon surrounding Si-
Al glassy ash particles, fly ash carbon also encases the Fe-spinels along
with rare earth elements. Fig. 25 illustrates the carbon deposit on the
surface of the several spinel grains entraining Nd, Ce, Sm, and Y. The ash
sample is a magnetic fraction of a beneficiated fly ash [192]. TEM im-
aging  and  the  EDS  mapping  of  the  Fe-spinel  minerals  at  a  larger
magnification further indicated that the spinel minerals occur in asso-
ciation with REY (Fig. 26). The enrichment of some REY, for example Gd
and Pr has been noted in the magnetic fractions of fly ashes from Eastern
Kentucky power plants [12,122]. In their study [12], despite that the
total REY contents of the magnetic concentrate (327 μg g-1) being lower
than the clean product fraction (< 200 mesh, 485 μg g-1), the Gd content
shows  a  enrichment  trend  in the  magnetic  fraction  (55 μg g-1  for the
magnetic  fraction  versus  18  μg  g-1  REY  for  the  <200-mesh  fraction).
Praseodymium is another element with a notably increased content in
the magnetic fraction (35 μg g-1 versus 19 μg g-1).

Overall, results of the TEM combined with the EDS mapping indi-
cated  that  nanosized  particles  containing  a  broad  suite  of  REY  were
found  in  amorphous  and  graphitic  carbons  surrounding  and  binding
either aluminosilicate glass or iron spinel grains in coal ash. It seems that
REY occurs as sub-micron, nano-scale mineral grains associated with fly
ash carbons. In another sample from the study of Hower et al. [122],
some Ce oxide was observed as 1-2-nm spheres encased with carbon,
suggesting that the particles may be formed in the ash by nucleation and

growth, consistent with the observation of REY inclusions in graphitic
carbons,  which  might  form  during  incomplete  combustion  processes,
not as the fractured remnants of minerals from the coal. However, unlike
the REY minerals seen in the fly ashes, the association of REY with un-
burned carbon is very difficult to resolve and the formation mechanisms
seem to be elusive. In contrast the visible individual mineral inclusions
in  the  carbons,  some  REY  either  dispersed  throughout  (Fig.  22)  or
incorporated  into  the  fly  ash  carbons  (Fig.  24)  are  too  small  to  be
detected as independent mineral grains or really bound to the unburned
carbon (like Hg-C structure). More research and evidence are needed for
confirming  those  associations  and  the  formation  mechanisms  in  the
future.

6. Behavior of REY in coal-fired power plants

6.1. REY partitioning across the coal-fired power plants

When  considering  the  fate  of  REY  in  coal-fired  power  plants,  it  is
important  to  estimate  the  distribution  of  REY  in  various  product
streams. This determines which types of coal combustion byproducts are
suitable for REY recovery upon the coal combustion. Generally, inputs of
REY  into  a  utility  combustion  system  include coal  and  any  additives,
such as limestone for desulphurization, and urea for denitrification; the
outputs  from  a  coal-fired  power  plant  include  bottom  ash,  fly  ash,
gypsum,  filter  sludge,  flue  gas,  and  escaped  fine  particulate  matter
[266].

6.1.1. Mass balances of REY in power plants

Table 16 gives a summary of the distribution of REY among different
emission streams of coal-fired power plants. Several filed measurements
and laboratory combustion tests estimated the overall mass balance of
REY in various streams, finding the mass balance ratios greatly varied in
different plants. In a work by Wu et al. [180], the distribution of REY in
four China coal-fired power plants was investigated. The mass balance
obtained  for  a  300-MW  circulated  fluidized  bed  boiler  (CFB)  and  a

pulverized  coal-fired  (PC)  power  plant  were  satisfied  (79.4-103.4%).
Only  37-79.4%  REY  recovery  were  obtained  for  another  two  power
plants.  In  another  laboratory-scale  case  study  by  Li  et  al.  [185],  an
evaluation  of  REY  partitioning  behavior  during  coal  combustion  was
performed  at  three  pilot-scale  combustion  tests  on  a  50-kW  underfed
stoker  unit.  Good  mass  balance  closures  (81-84%)  were  achieved  for
REY (taking Ce as proxy) of the two combustion runs, with another one
having lower ratios (37%).

The mass balance ratio of REY by measuring the REY content in all
types of solid products (e.g., gypsum) and particularly flue gas has rarely
been reported. Based on US Environmental Protection Agency Method
29 (EPA Method 29) for sampling and determination of trace metals in
flue gas , recent field measurements on five Guizhou coal-fired power
plants in Southwest China indicated that the concentration of REY in
gypsums and flue gases was low, with ranges of 5.7-11.7 μg g-1 and 5.9-
21.4 μg m-3, respectively [28]. The mass balance ratio for REY in the five
power plants was acceptable (90.3-113.7%). Overall, a closed balance
for  REY  in  coal  power  plants  is  difficult  to  obtain  and  the  evaluated
ratios are subjected to large errors. The lower mass balance ratios for
some  measurements  may  arise  because  (1)  the  collected  combustion
byproducts do not correspond the coal burned in the furnace, this usu-
ally occurs in utility boiler experiencing large deviations, such as the
boiler load, combustion temperature, residence time, varying feed coal
sources, and among others; (2) REY emitted as gaseous species are not
determined; and (3) contaminants in sample preparation and analytical
errors in REY determination.

6.1.2. Relative distribution of REY among ash streams

Following  the  summary  of  Smith  [267],  Meij  [266],  and  Clarke
[268], and modified from Hower et al. [262], three groups of elements
are  broadly  classified  according  to  their  volatility  and  partitioning
behavior  during  coal  combustion  (Fig.  27).  Due  to  the  high  boiling
temperature, REY in coal are hardly volatilized and can be categorized
as non-volatile elements. As shown in Table 16, almost all of REY par-
titioned into the solid ash after coal combustion. The mass fractions of
REY in gypsum plus flue gas were calculated to be less than 1% [28].
Therefore, coal ash has been regarded as a primary byproduct for REY
recovery. Moreover, it seems that fly ash may have more advantages for
REY recovery than bottom ash in terms of the REY concentration and
“reserve”. Mardon and Hower [250] arranged a set of REE-rich Fire Clay
coals from a single seam of a single mine burned in a 220-MW wall-fired
boiler  for  tracking  the  fate  of  trace  elements  in  coal  combustion.  Fly
ashes collected from the economizer, mechanical hopper, and electro-
static precipitator hopper have higher REY contents (average value of
1422 μg g-1,  ash-basis) than bottom ash (1203 μg g-1, ash-basis).  The
slight higher REY contents in fly ash than bottom ash were also reported
in many other power plants [24,27,119,161,178] . The mass ratio of fly
ash to bottom ash for utility PC boilers varied significantly, but generally
around 4:1. As a result, during coal combustion, most of REY in coal
could transfer into the fly ash. In the studies of Wu et al. [180] and Li
et al. [28], REY in coal fly ash derived from nine Chinese power plants
show higher mass ratio of 42-94% than that of bottom ash (6-58%) [28,
180]. These results could be useful for selecting REY sources from coal
combustion byproducts. Note that an uneven distribution between fly
ash and bottom ash does not follow the classification of trace element in
Fig. 27 [266]. The variation of REY contents in fly ash as a function of
particle sizes and collection arrays in power plants is not only controlled
by the REY volatility but other factors as will be discussed below.

6.2. REY partitioning within ash-collection systems

6.2.1. Variations in REY distribution pattern within ash-collection systems
The distribution of REY content within fly ash collection system, i.e.,
electrostatic precipitator (ESP), baghouse or fabric filter (FF) is firstly
dependent on their concentrations in feed coal. After coal combustion,
the  partitioning  of  several  volatile  elements  (Group  2&3  in  Fig.  27)
within ESP or FF is a function of flue gas temperature and particle size at
the collection point [272]. As with the decreased flue gas temperature
and ash particle size, the concentration of volatile trace elements trend
towards the back row of the ash collection system. Unlike the volatile

collection

trace elements (e.g., Hg, As, and Se), rare earth elements have very low
volatility; therefore, significant variations in REY content may not be
expected among the fly ashes collected from different zones of individ-
ual
of
theAppalachian-high-REE-bituminous-coal  fired  power  plant  with  a
two-row mechanical (cyclone)/three-row ESP ash collection system is a
good case showing the REY distribution in fly ash capture system [250].
The  fractionation  of  REY  in  the  mechanical  and  ESP  fly  ashes,  while
variable, shows less temperature-related distribution than observed in
the volatile elements. Rather, the total REY fall within a narrow range of
1214-1668  μg  g-1  (Fig.  28  (a)).  A  decrease  in  the  ratio  of  LREE  (La
through  Eu)  to  HREE  (HREE:  Gd  through  Lu)  can  be  observed  from
mechanical rows (> 8) through the last row of ESP (< 6) (Fig. 28 (b)).
Hower et al. [167] also noted the fractionation between LREE and HREE
after examining the chemistry of paired feed coal and corresponding ash
from five different anthracite-burning stoker boilers. Light lanthanides
decreased in concentration relative to heavy REE, as seen in the average
coal LREE/HREE (9.8) against the average ash LREE/HREE (9.4). The
N  (3.7 to 3.4) while increase in GdN/Gd*
decrease in the average CeN/Ce*
N
(1.9 to 2.1) from coal to ash also indicates a shift in LREE and HREE
during coal combustion.

Similar to the REY variation in the study of Hower [250,262], the
enrichment  of  heavy  lanthanides  towards  the  back  rows  of  the  ash
collection  systems  is  notable  in  another  three  Kentucky  power  plants
plus  power  plants  from  Bulgaria  [259].  There  are  three-  to  five-row
mechanical/ESP-ash  collection  system  installed  within  these  power
plants, burning coals of varying ranks (lignite, subbituminous coal, and
bituminous coal), with Plant P exclusively burning a small amount of
waste  tires  with  high-S  coal.  When  the  last-row  ESP  lanthanides  are
normalized  to  the  first-row  REY  concentrations,  all  cases  exhibit  an
enrichment in the HREE (Fig. 29, after Hower et al. [259]). The ratio of
critical to total REY also increases from the front ESP rows to the rear
rows.

Overall,  there  is  no  significant  partitioning  of  REY  within  ash
collection systems. Nonetheless, with respect to the enrichment of HREE
in  coal  fly  ash  especially  the  back  rows  of  ash  collection  system,  the
detailed mechanisms are still not well understood. It is known that the
flue gas temperature and particle size decrease with increased distance
from the boiler. In the study of Liu et al. [158], the distribution of REY in
a  series  of  fly  ash  derived  from the  combustion  of  coal  at  a  100-MW
pulverized-coal-fired  power  plant  in  southeastern  Kentucky  was
measured.  The  ratio  of  LREE/HREE  decreases  in  economizer  (7.15)
through mechanical hoppers (6.45) to the last row of ESP (4.74), sug-
gesting  the  enrichment  of  HREE  would  be  associated  with  either  a
decrease in flue gas temperature or in the fly ash particle size. Fly ash
petrology may provide some evidences explaining the increased HREE
contents in fine fly ash, which might be due to [262] (1) the result of
HREE  having  an  affiliation  to  the  organics  in  feed  coal;  and  (2)  the
capture of the fine REY minerals into the glassy particles varying in size,
chemistry,  and  structure,  demonstrated  by  fly  ash  petrology  study  of
sized ash, which will be discussed below.

6.2.2. Variations of REY in sized fly ash and implications for REY
partitioning trend

The particle size distribution of REY in fly ash is important to REY
beneficiation from bulk ash into sized ash containing high contents of
REY [21,166,259]. To understand the variation of REY contents versus
particle size, the size dependence of REY has been investigated in several
studies  [20,21,23,24,33,119,158,161,170,178,192].  Apart  from  the
finest fly ashes (minus 500-mesh), the REY concentrations in sized fly
ash  (100-500  mesh)  of  individual  hoppers,  as  examined  by  Liu  et  al.
[158] noted above, have no defined trend (Fig. 30a). For the fly ash with
particle  size  lower  than  200-mesh  size,  the  ratio  of  LREE/HREE  de-
creases with the decrease in ash size for all the ash hoppers (Fig. 30a).
Similar  to  Liu  et  al.  (2014),  the  enrichment  of  REY  and  decrease  in

mine, thus eliminating the variations from multiple coal sources on REY
fractionation during coal combustion [158,250]. As shown in Fig. 31, all
sized fractions show similar distribution pattern, characterized by me-
dium REY enrichment mode and positive anomalies of Eu and Gd. This
suggested  that  there  is  no  notable  fractionation  among  different  size
fractions. Difference in fly ash petrology may account for the LREE/H-
REE distributions. For the two most abundant fractions of mechanical
ash,  LREE/HREE  significantly  differs  between  the  100-325  mesh  ash
(7.30-7.37) and the fraction < 325 mesh (5.35-5.94). The 100-325 mesh
ash has 70.1% glass compared to 85.8% glass in the <325-mesh fraction.
As  summarized  in  section  5,  REY  bound  with  glassy  materials  is  the
dominant association in coal fly ash. Variations in the amount and size of
REY  minerals  between  and  in  the  microscopically  identifiable  fly  ash
constituents can contribute to the differences in REY contents across the
ash-collection array and the sized ash fractions.

LREE/HREE in the finest fly ash by sieving is also reported by several
investigations  [21,23,167,192].  However,  one  exception  study  of  the
sized fly ash from Jungar power plant found that the concentration of
REY  in  the  finer  fly  ash  were  not  significantly  enriched  and  only
increased  by  a  factor  of  less  than  2.5.  For  fly  ash  with  much  smaller
particle size (< 20 μm), the enrichment of REY in the finer sized ash was
noted in two cases study [166,170]. With an air-based classifier, fly ash
was separated into size down to 2.2 μm (the whole size ranging from 2.2
to 43.2 μm), and REY exhibited an increase in the finest size fraction but
depleted in the second-finest sized ash (2.2-9.7μm) relative to the bulk
fly ash [166]. In another study [170], fly ash was separated into 0.3-2.5
and 2.5-10 μm size range using a cascade impactor. The contents of REY
increased from 352.4 μg g-1 in the fine fly ash (2.5 -10 μm) to 384 μg g-1
in the coarse ash (2.5-10 μm).

Overall, as non-volatile elements, REY show an enrichment in finer
fly ash but a relatively random distribution in the whole size range, and
the enrichment of HREY (decreasing LREE/HREE) towards the finer fly
ash is notable. The normalized distribution pattern of REY versus the
particle size provides clues for REY partition among various sized ash
(Fig. 31). Here, the sized ash from the same hoppers from a southern
Kentucky power plant perhaps gives the best examples, since coal feed to
the boiler was specially arranged from a single coal seam from a single

Phosphate minerals such as monazite and xenotime are the common
REY-bearing minerals found in coal (see section 2.3). These phosphate
minerals  have  high  melting  temperature  point,  depending  upon  their

elemental components: monazite (RPO4) melts at 1916

C,  respectively  [273].  Accordingly,  monazite  and  xenotime
particles  with  high  thermal  stability  would  remain  intact  during  coal
combustion  and,  after  removal  of  organic  matter,  should  be  more
commonly seen in coal fly ash than that in the feed coal. However, the
mineralogy study of fly ash at micro-scale does not support this deduc-
tion. The microanalysis of REY-rich coal, for example, the well-known
REY-bearing  Fire  Clay  coal  [36,46,135],  can  readily  find  discrete
monazite particles and other REY-bearing minerals (such as zircon) at
several microns disseminated through the coal matrix. In contrast, the
fly ash has few REY mineral grains that can be seen by optical/electron
microscopy [144,147,192,231,236]. If monazite and other REY-bearing
phases are scarcely to be observed at the scale of optical/electron mi-
croscopy, where are the rare earth elements in fly ashes? Hood et al.
[192] demonstrated that pure monazite grains (hundreds of microme-
ters)  will  shatter  into  micron  and  sub-micron  particle  at  1400  oC
(Fig. 32). A possible mechanism of the heat-induced fragmentation is the
expansion of He produced from the decay of 238U and 232Th [274–276].
Among the other important REY minerals in coal, REE-bearing carbon-
ates may also experience fragmentation at boiler temperature because
the release of carbon dioxide [230]. Zircon will decompose to zirconia
and  cristobalite  in  the  temperature  range  of  1285-1720
C  [277].

Apatite, fluorapatite, and zircon may also experience fragmentation at
boiler  temperatures.  Very  fine  REE  phosphate  minerals,  REY-bearing
CaO, and other unknown phases at a few μm to nm are observed in fly
ash, suggesting the REY mineral fragmentation contributes to the final
distribution and occurrences in coal ash.

6.3.2. Phase transformation and chemical reactions

While the REY minerals are thermally stable, REE-bearing phases in
coal may experience complicated chemical transformation during coal
combustion. For example, the XANES results of Ce in fly ash samples
have  identified  that  the  redox-sensitive  trivalent  REE  (Ce)  could  be
changed into high valence state (RE4+
) [145,232]. Thermal decompo-
sition  and  conversion  of  individual  REE-bearing  phases  in  coal  can
provide  insights  into  the  transformation  behavior  of  REE  during  coal
combustion. Liu et al. [230] used an in-situ XRD combined with a ther-
mal analyzer to monitor the phase transformation of typical pure REY
phases at the temperature range of 25-1000
C (Fig. 33) and found that
(1) REE-organic compounds and REE carbonates will decompose (T >
300 °C) into oxides; (2) water-bearing REE phosphates will lose water
after heating with no Ce oxidation; (3) REE phosphates such as monazite
and xenotime have no structure change; but (4) REE-bearing phosphates
(e.g.  apatite)  and  zircon  show  characteristics  of  melting  on  mineral
surface. A summary of the thermal conversion pathways of typical REE
forms in coal is illustrated in Table 17.

◦

Note  that  the  combustion  temperature  (< 1000  °C)  of  the  experi-
mental  devices  limits  Liu  et  al’s  [230]  observations  and  conclusions.
First of all, the flame temperature for the most-commonly used pulver-
ized coal-fired boiler varies from 1200-1800 °C. When the combustion
temperature  is  above  1000  °C,  the  stable  REE  mineral  phases  may
shatter into small grains (such as monazite) or chemically decompose
into other phases (such as zircon), as mentioned above. In addition, as an
important carrier for REY in coal, apatite is not stable and can transform
into other phases with temperature being greater than 1000 °C; and the
decomposition temperature is dependent on the anion position in the
hexagonal axis showing decrease order of F(fluorapatite) > Cl (chlor-
apatite) > OH (hydroxyapatite) [278] (Table 17). Secondly, there are
still many other REE minerals or non-mineral phases, such as REY car-
bonates  (kimuratie  and  lanthanite)  and  REE-bearing  clay  phases
requiring an in-depth study for their combustion behavior. As noted in
2.3, most of REE mineral grains are included within coal macerals, and
thus  the  combustion  atmosphere  (reducing  or  oxidizing)  should  be
considered  in  the  future  work  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  REY
speciation transformation behavior in coal combustion process.

After coal burning, fly ash will be exposed to flue gas with varying
temperature along the process path from the flame zone (1300 -1700 oC)
to  the  inlet  of  ESP  or  FF  (around  150  oC).  Flue  gas  is  a  complicated
oxidizing system, in which the gas compositions mainly consist of N2,
CO2, H2O, and O2; minor amounts of NOX, SOX, CO, HCl, and Cl2; and

trace amounts of gaseous heavy metals such as Hg [279–281]. In the
complex environment of flue gas, the REY associations contained within
fly ash could be impacted due to the reactions occurring between fly ash
and flue gas. There are about 30s are available for the occurrences of the
gas-solid reactions [282]. A good example of the reactions between flue
gas components and REY speciation can be the presence of Ce (IV) in
coal ash, despite that Ce (III) might be the dominant valence state (>
85%) in coal-derived fly ash [230,232]. Using the μ-XRF mapping and
μ-XANES techniques, Stuckman et al. [232] observed the co-existence of
Ce, S, P, and Ca in eleven coal ash samples, inferring the formation of

REE species such as REE-bearing sulfates and carbonates in the transport
process of coal-derived flue gas in power plants. Bulk Ce XANES spectra
of  some  fly  ash  samples  also  matched  the  reference  Ce  (III)  chloride
spectra, suggesting a chlorination of REY in the flue gas. In another study
by Taggart et al. [233], bulk Y XANES results indicated that Y coordi-
nation  states  in  class  F  fly  ash  samples  resemble  a  combination  of
Y-bearing  carbonates  and  other  species  (Y-doped  glass  and  YPO4);
whereas Y spectra of class C fly ash shows characteristics of Y2(SO4)3.
Potential reactions of REY species in fly ash with flue gas components
can be described as following [42,253]:

6.4. Further retention mechanisms by fly ash glass

Apart from organic-bound REY, REY in coal is seldom vaporized into
gaseous form in flue gas during coal combustion [230,251]. Most of REY
in coal is transformed into the solid residual (mainly fly ash) (Table 16).
As  discussed  in  section  5,  the  instrumental  analysis  and  chemical
leaching of REY from coal fly ash demonstrated that a large fraction of
REY is captured and enclosed within the Si-Al-based glassy materials.
This would be understandable since the glass is usually the most abun-
dant constituent in coal ash [283–285]. However, the detailed retention
mechanisms are unclear. This is largely because (1) the details of the
decomposition  and  chemical  reactions  of  various  coal  minerals  in
combustion  process,  especially  for  a  particle  containing  a  mixture  of
mineral
inclusions  are  poorly  understood  [160];  and  (2)  the
morphology, chemistry, structure, and size of glass in coal ash itself are
complex to be characterized [286,287], which will influence the reac-
tivity of fly ash glass [288–291]. The fly ash glass reactivity is important
in many areas, for example the use of fly ash as a pozzolan in concrete
[292,293],  the  environmental  leachability  of  hazardous  elements
released from ash landfilling sites [286,290,294], and the recovery of
valuable metals as we discussed in this study. Therefore, the following
section will make a short review on the characteristics of fly ash glass,
providing a basis for understanding the close association of REY with
glass and for designing an efficient REY extraction scheme.

6.4.1. Origin and formation

According to ASTM [295], glass is a type of non-crystalline inorganic
material  formed  upon  the  melts  cooling.  Glass  is  also  regarded  as  a
super-cooled  liquid  product  obtained  from  high-temperature  melt
[296]. From the point of mineralogy and petrology, fly ash is essentially
composed of crystalline minerals, unburnt carbon, and non-crystalline
aluminosilicate  glass  [297].  For  coal  ash,  quantitative  X-ray  diffrac-
tion researches [285] and petrographic examinations [297–299] indi-
cate that the Si-Al glass is the dominant phases in most fly ashes; and it is
not  a  uniform  and  homogeneous  aluminosilicate  material.  The  petro-
graphic  examination  of  coal  ash  is  typically  performed  on  an
epoxy-bound  ash  pellet  with  polarized  reflected-light,  oil-immersion
optics  [300,301],  with  the  unburned  carbon  usually  being  the  main
target [296,337,340],  [300]. In the case of inorganic compositions of
coal ash, Hower et al. [297,299,301] proposed a classification scheme
detailing the inorganic components as amorphous glass, mullite, crys-
talline silicates, spinel, lime, sulfates, and oxidized minerals (Fig. 34).
Under  optical  microscopy,  typical  fly  ash  glass  includes:  amorphous
solid and frothy phases (Fig. 35A), glassy cenospheres (Fig. 35B), and
pleiopheres (Fig. 35B). The formation of these different glasses in the
context of pulverized coal-fired (PC) combustion involves the mineral
reactions in the melting and cooling history of coal ash, which can be
summarized as:

• thermal decomposition and transformation of aluminosilicate min-
erals (mainly clays) in combustion zone to mullite, spinel, cristoba-
lite  and  liquid  phase,  which  occurs  exothermically  above  950  °C
[302];

• melting of the mineral products to liquid droplets on the surface of
the  coal  particle  and  coalescence  into  large  particle  as  the  char
burning [287,303–305]; and

• quenching of the liquid as it leaves the combustion zone in boiler.

including  quartz,  carbonates,  and  pyrite

Feed  coal  mineral  types  and  temperature  are  important  factors
affecting the formation of silicate melts in pulverized coal combustion
process  [287,297,302,303,305,306].  Clay  minerals  usually  dominate
the coal mineralogy and are the main sources for silicate melts and glass
formation. The combustion behavior of clays and other common min-
erals
in  coal  are
well-understood [297,302,307–309]. As summarized in Table 18 [297],
coal  minerals  and  their  decomposition  products  having  high  melting
point  above  the  boiler  temperature  include:  (1)  crystalline  minerals
including  quartz,  mullite,  lime,  MgO,  etc.,  and  (2)  poorly-crystalline
materials  such  as  cristobalite.  These  minerals  and  their  intermedia
products may survive the whole coal combustion process.

However,  note  that  the  melting  point  of  a  mineral  may  change,
largely depending upon the mineral compositions, mineral-mineral as-
sociation and the combustion atmosphere (oxidizing or reducing). For
example,  the  clay  mineral  decomposition  products  typically  melt  at
above 1400 °C, but the melting can occur at around 980 °C for SiO2-
Al2O3-K2O eutectics. This is often seen in illite and smecite combustion
process, because these two minerals contain certain amounts of alkaline
elements [308]. Besides, the “included”  clay minerals usually co-exist
with  other  minerals  within  individual  coal  particles  [310,311].
Table 19 gives the types of mineral-mineral association in a U.K. bitu-
minous  coal  as  determined  by  CCSEM  technique  [310].  As  expected,
clays  are  the  dominant  associations  and  almost  40%  of  the  mineral
matter  are  present  as  multiple  mineral  occurrences  in  a  single  coal
particle.  Thus,  the  mineral  reactions  in  coal  burning  are  not  only
self-transformations  but  thermal  reactions  of  their  intermediate  prod-
ucts with other minerals and mineraloids. Melting of the thermal inac-
tive components (quartz and clay decomposition products) with adding
modifiers may  occur as  the burnout of  coal particles  (mineral coales-
cence) [287,305,310,312]. For example, the SiO2-Al2O3-CaO system has
several eutectics at around 1200-1300 °C [313–315]. At 1000-1200 °C,
pyrites co-existing with clay minerals in a single coal particle (reducing

may also have influence on the REY mineral transformation, as will be
discussed in next section.

To summarize, the melting of inorganic components in boiler is the
basis for glass formation in fly ash. When the coal particles burn in a PC
boiler, spherical droplets and inflated molten particles derived from the
combustion of clay and other minerals are the two notable features. As
the  particle  leave  the  boiler,  the  quenching  of  the  spherical  molten
particles will form the spherical glassy particle. If the included minerals
within  coal  particles  are  fully  melted,  the  gases  released  from  the
decomposition of char, carbonates, sulfide minerals, and vaporization of
pore water may be trapped in the liquid microspheres. Then the gases
can bloat the molten melt up to a 500-μm diameter hollow particle [303,
318,319]; and the size and the thickness of the particle (cenosphere) are
a  function  of  the  melt  viscosity  and  gas  pressure.  The  pure  mineral
decomposition and reactions are important to understand the formation
of silicate liquid but cannot capture the real interactions among two or
more different minerals in coal combustion process. The details of the
mineral-mineral reactions, especially for a mineral mixture containing
one or more types of mineral inclusions are poorly understood [302,306,
310,320,321].  Besides,  fly  ash  glass  usually  co-exist  with  crystalline
minerals,  for  example  magnetite  and  mullite  crystals  presenting  as  a
spherical  shell of  the fly ash  glass [286,299,302]. These  minerals are
derived from either recrystallization of the melts or directly from parent

mineral  transformations  in  the  thermal  conversion  process  [302,306,
322]. The REY phases that are immediately adjacent to or surrounded by
the  mineral  phases  (such  as  mullite  and  quartz)  within  a  dense  Al-Si
glass would offer physical resistance to the release of REY from fly ash
[122,144,231].

6.4.2. Structure and chemistry

Glasses  are  usually  described  as  “non-crystalline”,  “vitreous”,  or
“amorphous”  solids  [296].  These  terms  are  considered  to  be  synony-
mous, revealing the state of atoms in the glasses are highly disordered.
For  fly  ash  glass,  it  mainly  consists  of  silicate  and/or  aluminosilicate
glass, and it can be simply described as“... an inorganic product of fusion
which has been cooled to a rigid condition without crystallizing.” [323].
Many attempts have been made to understand the structure of silicate
melts and glass materials. It is beyond the scope of this study to review
the extensive papers on glass structure and its formation mechanisms;
but generally, the random network model and crystallite model can be
used as two typical models for the description of silicate glass structure
[323]. For a complex system such as coal fly ash, the random network
model proposed by Zachariasen [324] that was established on the basis
of crystal chemistry view of Goldschmidt has been widely used [287,
290,291,298]. The glass structure in coal ash and its relationship with
glass composition are very complex, because the inter- and intra-particle
heterogeneity of fly ash brings difficulties to an absolute understanding
of fly ash glass [287,288,290,305,306]. A basic knowledge is that the
structure  and  chemistry  of  the  fly  ash  glass  vary  with  the  feed  coal
properties and the boiler operational conditions.

Structurally, the atoms in silicate glass are disordered arranged in
long  range  but  has  short-  and  medium-range  order.  This  short-range
order  but  long-range  disorder  atomic  model  has  been  extensively
examined by various analytical methods, for example extended X-ray-
absorption fine structure, nuclear magnetic resonance, and nano-beam
electron diffraction [325–331]. The structure disorder in fly ash glass
has  been  considered  as  a  result  of  three  factors  [284]:  (1)  rapid
quenching of silicate melts; (2) network isomorphic substitution; and (3)
cation modification. The tetrahedral [SiO4] is the skeleton of the fly ash
glass according to the network theory [324]. Usually, though, fly ash
glass has a multi-component chemistry and is more complex than the
vitreous  SiO2.  In  the  three-dimensional  network  structure,  the
co-melting of silicon oxides with other network formers such as Al3+
,
Fe3+
(with  coordination  numbers  of  3  or  4)  can  replace  Si
(disorder due to substitution). The introduction of network modifiers,
, with coordination numbers ≥ 6
such as Na
induces  de-polymerization  of  the  network  (disorder  due  to  modifica-
tion). The intermediates, such as Al, can either reinforce (coordination
number of four) or weakens the network (coordination number of five or
six), depending upon the amount of Al and the modifier elements [284,

287,305,307]. Accordingly, both of the substitution and cation modifi-
cation order would prevail in the structure of fly ash glass [284,308]. For
example, the position of 2θ in XRD patterns of sodium silicate shows a
) with increasing Na2O
marked shift in the halo to a higher angle (32-34
content (0-50%) [323]. In another study, Brindle and McCarthy [305]
extensively  examined  the  relationship  between  ash  glass  content  and
chemistry of 75 European fly ashes. Their result suggested a major in-
fluence of alkali elements on the glass formation during coal combustion
[305].

◦

The chemistry of fly ash glass is dominated by SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, and
Fe2O3; with minor MgO, K2O, Na2O, P2O5; and trace elements including
rare earth elements. Based on the structural characteristics of the major
components, Hemmings and Berry [284] summarized that the chemistry
of fly ash glass locates between silica fume and the Ca-rich blast furnace
slag:

• lignite ash bituminous ash has 72% network formers (SiO2 + Al2O3
+ Fe2O3) and 28% network modifiers (MgO + K2O + Na2O + CaO);
• subbituminous  ash  has  81-84%  network  formers  (SiO2  + Al2O3  +
Fe2O3) and 16-19% network modifiers (MgO + K2O + Na2O + CaO);
and

• bituminous ash has 84-90% network formers (SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3)

and 10-16% network modifiers (MgO + K2O + Na2O + CaO).

However, the result is a general summary of chemical compositions
of  fly  ash  glass.  Ash  particles  may  greatly  vary  in  their  compositions
from grain-to-grain (inter-particle difference) in a fly ash derived from
the burning of the same coal at a power plant. This extreme heteroge-
neity of fly ash is a result of (1) feed coal properties, i.e., variations in
coal rank and seam to seam changes resulting in the coal mineralogy
that are differentiated largely by the alkaline and alkaline earth element
contents,  e.g.,  lignite  usually  contains  more  of  K,  Na,  and  Ca  than
bituminous coal [283,312]; and (2) variations in the formation condi-
tions and collection points at the power plants, for example, the boiler
condition,  load,  ESP  fields,  and  among  others  [250,262,272,332].
Therefore, it would be more difficult to study the distribution differences
of REY among various glasses in coal ash due to its trace amount in coal
ash.

6.4.3. Possible incorporation mechanisms of REY into fly ash glass

Based on the study of REY speciation in coal ash and the glass for-
mation mechanisms during coal combustion, two capture mechanisms
can be broadly proposed:

• the incorporation of individual fine REY-bearing mineral grain into

Si-Al melts (physical encapsulation);

• the  incorporation  of  rare  earth  elements  into  the  aluminosilicate
glass structures in the melting process (physiochemical diffusion).

The first  capture  mechanism has  been  demonstrated by  numerous
electron  microscopy  studies  [122,144,147,192,231,237,333].  Typical
REY-bearing  mineral  grains  such  as  monazite,  xenotime,  zircon,  and
apatite  at  varying  size  (from  several  microns  to  nanometers)  are
observed  to  be  partly  or  fully  embedded  within  fly  ash  glass
(Figs. 16-19). Mineral-mineral associations may be an important factor
influencing the process. As indicated in Section 2.3, prior to combustion
in coal-fired boilers, these REE-bearing minerals are almost dispersed
within coal organic maceral as included minerals (Fig. 6a and b); and
usually intermixed with other major coal minerals (such as clay minerals
in Fig. 6c and d). In this case, incorporation of these REY-bearing min-
eral  grains  into  glassy  components  can  occur  when  the  silicate  melts
form at PC boiler temperature (1300-1700 °C). The stable REY mineral
grains  or  its  derivative  products  will  naturally  enclosed  within  the
new-formed glass upon the cooling of the melts, at concentration and
particle size usually below the detection limit of XRD and optical mi-
croscopy techniques, respectively [192,237,238].

B. Fu et al.

Another possible pathway for capturing the REY mineral inclusions
may result from mineral collision and coalescence during the burnout of
parent  char  particles  [310].  Mineral  coalescence  has  been  used  to
describe the ash formation mechanism, and conditions for completing
the mineral coalescence generally require [334]: (1) at least two mineral
grains  included  within  one  coal  particle,  (2)  the  local  temperature  is
enough for mineral melting, and (3) contact between the molten parti-
cles.  As  indicated  in  Table  19,  individual  coal  particles  often  contain
more than one mineral grains, where REY phases may be present in some
coal particles. For PC boilers operating at normal temperature (> 1300
°C), the included REY-bearing constituents and the melted silicates will
be exposed as the decomposition and oxidation of coal char particles.
The distance between the ash droplets and REY minerals decreases as the
char combustion progress and finally would contact and merge into one
large particle in case of no fragmentation. Due to thermal stability of
REY minerals, the heterogeneity of the coalescent particles may exist, for
example monazite and zircon still persist in the large cenosphere or solid
glassy  sphere  particles  after  coalescence  (Fig.  16).  Note  that  the  coa-
lescence of minerals is limited to the coal char fragmentation. If there is
no char fragmentation, all the included minerals in a single coal particle
can be merged into one large particle (full-coalescence) after the com-
plete burnout of char [335,336]. But char fragmentation is usually seen
in  coal  particle  combustion  which  may  diminish  mineral  coalescence
[337,338]. A negative relationship between coal particle fragmentation
and mineral coalescence can be observed [142,339]. Thus, three models
including full-coalescence, partial-coalescence, and no-coalescence have
been proposed for different scenarios of mineral coalescence [322,335,
340,341]. The extent of mineral coalescence may account for the REY
associations in coal ash, that is, REY minerals are observed to have fully
enclosed, partially enclosed, or have no contact with the glassy particles
in coal ash. Besides  char fragmentation, the extent of mineral coales-
cence is also influence by the boiler type, mineral types and associations,
and mineral particle size [142].

In the case of the second retention mechanism, although most of the
REY-bearing phases in coal have high melting points, the incorporation
of REY-bearing phases into silicate melts (co-melting) might occur if (1)
the local temperature is high up to the melting interactions; (2) active
components (e.g., Na2O/CaO) exist in the silicate melts, and interactions
between  physically-associated  minerals  may  be  likely  to  bring  about
thermal chemical reactions at a high temperature. Evidences from the
direct determination of REY in various aluminosilicate glass particles via
SHRIMP-RG  analysis  may  support  the  REY  incorporation  mechanism
[146].  The  REE  distribution  patterns  in  different  fly  ash  glasses,  i.e.,
Al-rich  aluminosilicates,  Si-rich  aluminosilicates,  and  Ca-  and  Fe-rich
aluminosilicates,  are  similar  to  that  of  the  bulk  ash  (Fig.  36  a).  As
shown in Fig. 36 b, one zircon particle is found in the ash samples but the
chondrite-normalized  REE  distribution  of  zircon  exhibits  a  different
enrichment  mode  (HREE-enrichment  type)  from  the  bulk  fly  ash
(LREE-enrichment type). If the discrete mineral dominates the REY as-
sociations  in  ash,  then  the  normalized  distribution  pattern  cannot  be
consistent among various ash particles (see Figs. 31 and 36a). Therefore,
the enrichment of REY in coal ash would be explained by the diffusion of
REY into the fly ash glass at the expenses of REE trace phases in coal
[146].

The incorporation mechanisms are somewhat analogous to the pro-
cess in making rare earth silicate glass and in natural igneous system
[342,343]. The incorporation of rare earth oxides (RE2O3) into alumi-
nosilicate glass usually occurs at around 1500 °C (melting temperature)
[344–352].  This  suggest  that  similar  processes  may  occur  inside  the
pulverized coal-fired boilers, where the normal operating temperatures
◦
are maintained in 1300-1700
C. On the basis of reactions for producing
REY-bearing  silicate  glass,  the  REE  trace  phases,  at  least  for  some
REY-bearing  oxides  generated  from  decomposition  of  organic-bound
REE or carbonate-bound REE in coal might be dispersed into the sili-
cate melts. Even for the thermal stable REE phosphates (such as mona-
zite), potential reactions for decomposing monazite would happen when

active components such as CaO exists [353]:

3CaO + 2REPO4  = RE2O3  + Ca3(PO4)3

(7)

The decomposition temperature of monazite by adding CaO is 650-
780  °C,  significantly  lower  than  the  coal  combustion  temperature  in
power plants.  Note  that the  reaction  rate is  limited  by the  slow solid
diffusion rate; however, the multi-component coal-derived silicate melts
(especially containing high amounts of network modifiers) would favor
the reaction because the mass transfer process could be improved within
a liquid system [353].

Local structure of REY in the silicate glass network can provide more
details about the REY incorporation mechanisms. Various techniques,
for  example  magic  angle  spinning  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  spec-
troscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray and neutron diffraction spectros-
copy, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and atomistic molecular
dynamics  simulations  have  been  used  to  understand  the  structure  of
REY-bearing silicate glass [344,345,347,348,350,350,352,354–357]. As
illustrated  in  a  Y-bearing  glass  model  complexes  [348]  (Fig.  37),  the
primary units of the network are basically composed of SiO4  and AlO4
groups connected by bridging oxygen. Yttrium or Sc have coordination
numbers ≥ 5, connecting with their neighboring cation-centered poly-
hedral SiO4 and AlOx (x = 4, 5, and 6) predominantly by corner-sharing,
then by edge-sharing and rarely connected by the polyhedral face [344,
345,348,349,356].  The introduction  of  RE3+
into  aluminosilicate will
alter the structure and increase the configurational disorder, which are
manifested by: (1) the occurrence of higher-coordination Al species, i.e.,
AlO5 and AlO6, perhaps at the expense of AlO4 by the virtual reaction,
REO7 + AlO4 → REO6 + AlO5 [352,356]; (2) anomalous features of free
O ions and Al-O (NBO) over wider compositional ranges [344,345,356];
and (3) violations of Loewenstein’s rule by the presence of Al [4](cid:0) O(cid:0) Al
[4] bridges [356,358,359]. These short- and medium-range disorder will
be  concurrently  increased  with  the  filed  strength  of  RE3+
[349].
Generally, RE3+
ions have been considered to play dual roles in, not only
modifying  the  network  by  generating  NBO,  but  also  balancing  the
negatively  charged  AlO4  unit  [348,349,352,356,360].  For  example,
alkaline

earth-aluminosilicate glass exhibits dual functionality, i.e., decreasing
the  polymerization  like  a  modifier  at  high  temperature  but  strength-
ening  the  glass  network  at  lower  temperature.  Therefore,  when
considering the REY diffusion mechanisms during coal combustion, the
combustion  temperature  and  coal  mineralogy  including  the  mineral
types and mineral-mineral associations should be considered.

To  summarize,  during  coal  combustion,  the  enrichment  of  REY  in
coal ash is mainly related to the REY incorporation into silicate melts
and, thus, the fly ash glasses are the main hosts for REY. As shown in
Fig.  38,  two  retention  mechanisms  are  proposed  in  this  review.  The
capture of REY-bearing trace phases into glass is manifested by the direct
observation  of  micro-  and  nano-sized  REE-bearing  minerals  or  com-
pounds enclosed (or partially encapsulated) within aluminosilicate glass
[27,121,122,145,147,232,236]. While the coal ash is more enriched in
REY, REY-bearing trace phases are less common in coal ash than in the
parent coal. This might be explained by the size reduction of the REY
trace phases into nano-sized particles due to thermal shock [144,192].
The uniform chondrite-normalized REE distribution patterns for various
fly ash constituents versus bulk ash [146] and the consistent bulk Ce
[232] or Y [145,233] XANES of fly ash samples resembling Ce-, Y-doped
aluminosilicates argue against REY occurrences as randomly captured
and distributed sub-micron domains. Diffusion of REY from trace phases
to the aluminosilicate glass might be another REY capture mechanism.
Similar processes could be observed in REY-glass making industry or in
natural  magmatic  melt  system,  but  the  diffusion  mechanism  for
enriching  REY  in  coal  ash  seems  to  be  elusive.  In  a  coal-fired  power
plant,  thermal  maxima  last  on  the  order  of  1-2s,  whereas  times  in
diffusion  of  RE2O3  into  silicate  glass  is  generally  longer  (15  min  or
more).  Thus,  diffusion  of  trace  REE  phases  might  be  difficult  in  coal

volatile  trace  elements  (such  as  Hg,  As,  and  Se),  REY  entering  the
coal-fired boiler seem not be systematically fractionated between coal,
fly ash, and bottom ash. Nonetheless, the relative higher mass percent-
ages  of  REY  in  fly  ash  than  bottom  ash  can  be  observed,  probably
resulting from the (1) the ratio of fly ash to bottom ash produced in coal
combustion  process  is  usually  about 4:1;  and  (2)  higher  REY  concen-
trations in fly ash than in bottom ash. Likewise, little partitioning be-
tween  the  ash-collection  rows  is  observed.  However,  variation  in  the
light versus heavy REE has been noted between ESP rows and among
sized fractions of fly ashes. Currently, it is still not clear what is behind
the phenomenon, and two reasons may account for it: (1) HREE have
preferences for organic matter in coal, leading to HREE enrichment in
finer  fly  ash  particles  via  a  more  intense  vaporization-condensation
process  during  coal  combustion;  (2)  finer  fly  ash  particles  from
back-rows of ESP system may contain more glass components than that
of the coarse particles from the first ESP rows.

Detailed partitioning mechanisms of REY from coal to the solid ash
involve thermal decomposition of various REE species in coal, mineral
fragmentation, and incorporation of REY species into silicate melts at
furnace temperature (Fig. 39). Most of REY in coal occurs as thermally
stable  minerals  such  as  REY  phosphates  and  silicates,  indicating  that
some  REY  trace  phases  in  coal  may  survive  and  remain  intact  in  the
combustion process. However, one cannot readily reach the conclusions
that REY will not be subject to vaporize-condensation process and other
thermal reactions during coal combustion, because 1) some of REY in
coal occur as thermal unstable compounds, such REY-bearing carbon-
ates and organic-associated REY (Table 3); 2) different REY have their
special thermal properties and reactivities, as can be reflected in their
C; Fig. 27); and 3) even for the
wide boiling-point range (1193-3454
thermal stable REY-bearing minerals, these minerals, along with other
“active”  minerals  included  within  one  coal  particle  can  coalesce  and
react at a high-temperature condition (Fig. 38). It is commonly observed
that  REY  occur  in  aluminosilicate  glass  of  coal  ash  [16,23,121,122,
145–147,176,192,231–233,237,238].  The  partitioning  of  REY  species
into aluminosilicate glass is controlled by (1) variation in coal origins /
sources,  both  resulting  in  different  coal  mineralogical  characteristics
and  different  feed  coal  chemistry  affecting  the  glass  formation;  (2)
variations during ash formation and collection at coal-fired power plant,
such  as  the  combustion  conditions  of  the  boiler,  load,  ash  collection
device configurations, etc. After coal combustion, the interactions be-
tween REY in fly ash and flue gas compositions may further influence the
final speciation of REY in coal ash.

combustion systems. Overall, current research data is still insufficient
for a full understanding of REY enrichment mechanisms in aluminosil-
icate  glass  of  coal  ash.  It  is  necessary  to  know  whether  the  physical
encapsulation or diffusion mechanism dominate the REY incorporation
process  during  coal  combustion.  This  is  because  the  location  and
structure of REY in glasses greatly influence the extraction efficiency of
REY from coal ash, which is reflected in the chemical durability of the
aluminosilicate glass. Rare earth-bearing glasses, if the diffusion mech-
anism dominates, the extraction of fly ash glass might be more difficult
because rare earth cations in the glass network can increase the water,
acid, and alkaline resistance of glass [361,362].

6.5. Overview of REY partitioning mechanisms in coal-fired power plants

An overview of REY partitioning behavior in coal-fired power plants
is illustrated in Fig. 39. The mass balance of REY is an average value
based  on  the  field  sampling  data  from  Li  et  al.  [28]  as  an  example
explaining the REY fate in power plant. As shown in Fig. 39, due to the
high boiling temperature, REY in coal is hardly volatilized and therefore
the stack emission of REY from coal-fired power plants is negligible. In
contrast,  most  of  REY  will  partition  into  coal  ash.  Generally,  unlike

7. Methods for REY recovery from coal ash

7.1. Current REY extraction methods

Many laboratory experimental studies have been conducted in recent
years to  recover REY from coal combustion ash,  and the  investigated
methods can be classified as: (1) physical beneficiation [23,33,108,122,
166,175,363],  and  (2)  hydrometallurgical  extraction  [30,31,122,364,
365]. Moreover, pretreatment by roasting with the addition of appro-
priate  additives  has  also  been  employed  in  combination  with

hydrometallurgical extraction to achieve higher recovery values of REE
from coal combustion ash [107,165,366]. As reported in the literature,
the highest content of REY in coal combustion ash, especially coal fly
ash, is usually associated with fine-particle size, medium-density, and
non-magnetic  fractions  [23,33,108,175].  Therefore,  preconcentrates
containing  more  REY  relative  to  feed  ash  materials  can  be  obtained
using physical beneficiation methods, such as sieving, gravity separa-
tion, magnetic separation, and froth flotation.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)10095436

B. Fu et al.

7.2. Physical beneficiation

7.3. Hydrometallurgical extraction

A  summary of physical beneficiation performances is  presented in
Table 20. As shown in Table 20, preconcentrates of higher REY content
have  been  generated  from  several  coal  fly  ashes  through  physical
beneficiation;  however,  the  enrichment  ratios  of  REY  content  in  the
preconcentrates to that in the feeds are exceedingly low. This fact sug-
gested the low efficiency of using physical beneficiation to preconcen-
trate  REY  from  coal  combustion  ash.  In  order  to  achieve  a  higher
enrichment  ratio  and  produce  a  product  of  higher  grade,  different
physical beneficiation methods can be collectively applied. For example,
Blissett et al. [23] obtained a product containing 637 ppm of REY from a
fly ash with 505 ppm of REY, using flotation, magnetic separation, and
classifying cyclone to remove unburned carbon, magnetic particles, and
coarse particles, respectively. Pan et al. [108] used a process consisting
of size fractionation at 38 μm and magnetic separation of the undersize
material. Non-magnetic material containing 1025 ppm of REY was ob-
tained from a fly ash with 782 ppm of REY. Using preconcentrated coal
combustion  ash  as  a  higher-grade  feedstock  reduces  the  cost  for  REY
recovery. Besides, physical beneficiation can (1) produce a more uni-
form  feed  to  the  chemical  processing, (2)  eliminate  oversize  material
that  would  be  inefficient  to  process,  (3)  eliminate  carbons  that  can
adsorb chemicals, and (4) eliminate magnetics which usually have lower
REY.

While REY can be enriched from coal combustion ash using physical
beneficiation, in order to generate high-grade REY products hydromet-
allurgical  extraction  has  to  be  applied  to  transfer  REY  into  solution
which, in turn, can be further processed for purification and upgrading.
However,  due  to  the  inclusion  of  REY  in  the  glassy  matrix  of  coal
combustion ash, the leaching recovery of REY is normally low and harsh
reaction  conditions  are  required  [107,122,365,367].  As  reported  in  a
study  performed  on  a  fly  ash sample  collected from  a  Chinese power
plant, less than 20% of total rare earth elements were leached using 12M
HCl or 16M HNO3 [367]. The low leaching recovery of REE agrees with
findings  from  sequential  chemical  extraction  characterization  studies
reported in literature [26,121,368]. The majority of REE in coal com-
bustion ash is associated with aluminum-silicate phases which can only
be dissolved by digestion. However, there are some exceptions. Nearly
100%  of  rare  earth  recovery  has  been  achieved
for  high
calcium-containing fly ashes such as samples derived from Power River
Basin  coals  in  the  U.S.  [364].  Coal  combustion  ashes  generated  from
fluidized  bed  combustors  showed  relatively  high  leachabilities,  likely
due  to  the  lower  combustion  temperatures  than  pulverized  or  stoker
coal-fired boilers [15].

Given the low leachability of REY in most fly ashes, pretreatment by
roasting with additives (e.g., NaOH, Na2CO3, and CaO) or reacting with
strong  alkaline solutions  have  been applied  to dissolve  REY from ash
into solution [27,108,165,176,364,366,369]. In both cases, the amor-
phous  glassy  structure  of  coal  combustion  ash  is  destroyed,  and
difficult-to-leach rare earth minerals such as monazite are decomposed,
collectively  contributing  towards  high  REY  recoveries.  For  example,
Taggart  et  al.  [165]  compared  different  roasting  additives  and  found
that NaOH and Na2O2 performed better than other chemicals, and >90%
of total REY can be recovered followed by leaching under mild condi-
tions  such  as  1-2M  HNO3.  Strong  alkaline  solutions,  such  as  6.25  M
NaOH  [364],  3  M  NaOH  [369],  and  40%  NaOH  [27],  are  able  to
decompose aluminum-silicate glassy matrix into soluble species, such as
- [370,371]. Therefore, REY
2-, and Al(OH)4
H2SiO4
encapsulated in the matrix can be released and mostly converted into
rare  earth  hydroxides  under  such  strong  alkaline  conditions  [372],
which can be easily leached under weakly acidic conditions. Based on
the above discussions, the most effective way to recover REY from coal
combustion ash is combining physical and chemical methods. By taking
advantage of the fractionation characteristics of REY in the particles of
different physical natures, a high-grade feed material can be obtained
from  coal  combustion  ash  for  downstream  pretreatment  and  acid
leaching  processes.  Using  this  concept,  Pan  et  al.  [108]  developed  a
process, consisting of size classification, magnetic separation, roasting,
and  acid  leaching  units,  which  enables  80%  of  REY  in  the  physical
separation product to be recovered.

Nearly all existing studies reported in the literature failed to incor-
porate economic analysis. This analysis is essential for the commercial
deployment of technologies and processing flowsheets developed based
on laboratory experimental results. As shown in Table 21, nearly all the
hydrometallurgical  and  pyrometallurgical  methods  reported  in  the
literature consume an exceedingly high dosage of chemicals, suggesting
that operating costs for the recovery of REY from coal combustion ash
will be high, leading to low economic viability. The situation is wors-
ened by the fact that as an alternate resource, coal combustion ash has a
much lower REY content relative to conventional rare earth ore deposits.
As presented in a report by [373], the per tonne cost to process fly ash in
a commercial plant using alkaline followed by acid leaching is approx-
imately $140. This cost is too high to make the recovery economically
viable  if  only  REE  is  produced  as  the  saleable  product.  In  order  to
improve the economic viability for REE recovery from coal combustion
ash,  it  needs  to  be  combined  with  other  beneficial  uses,  such  as
aluminum  recovery  and  zeolite  production  [374,375].  A  technical
roadmap for recovering REY from coal combustion ash is presented in

leaching  –  purification,  preconcentration  –  alkaline  leaching  –  acid
leaching  –  purification,  and  preconcentration  –  roasting  –  leaching  –
purification. For a specific ash material, a comprehensive experimental
program  is  required  to  find  the  most  efficient  and  cost-effective
flowsheet.

8. Conclusions

Coal ash is one of the most promising sources for rare earth elements
and  yttrium  (REY).  The  present  work  aims  for  (1)  making  a  compre-
hensive summary of REY contents, distribution, speciation, and analyt-
ical  methods  for REY  in coal  ash; (2) a  deeper  understanding of  REY
partitioning  behavior  in  particular  the  speciation  transformation  and
retention  mechanisms  during  coal  combustion;  and  (3)  the  recovery
methods  developed  in  recent  years.  The  distribution  of  REY  among
various  streams  across  the  whole  power  plants  and  the  retention
mechanisms of REY by fly ash glasses are deeply discussed.

• The most fundamental control on REY in coal ash is their amount in
the parent coal. REY in coal is most commonly in phosphate minerals
but can occur in a number of other minerals (carbonates, silicates,
etc.) as “included” minerals and in organic association in low-rank
coals. The concentration of REY greatly varies in different coal de-
posits or even coal seams, and the combustion of “metalliferous coal”
can  produce  REY-rich  ash  meeting  the  cut-off  grade  for  industrial
extraction. A detailed knowledge of REY in feed coals is essential for
providing both a background and basis for recovering REY from the
resulting ash as alternative sources.

• Methods to characterize REY in coal ash can inform REY extraction
strategies. A summary and comparison on the advantages and limi-
tations  of  various  methods  for  determining  REY  contents  and

speciation is made in this study. Methods that are used for total REY
content  determinations  mainly  include  ICP-MS,  followed  by  ICP-
OES, INAA, and XRF. ICP-MS is recommended for determining REY
in  coal  ash  because  of  its  high  sensitivity  and  multi-elemental
capability.  INAA  could  be  a  reference  method  for  estimating  the
precision and accuracy in determination of REY by other techniques.
XRF,  as  a  rapid  and  nondestructive  method  for  analysis  of  solid
sample, is suitable for field survey screening coal ash for laboratory
examination  and  REY  recovery.  Sequential  leaching  can  quantify
REY  associations  but  often  have  difficulties  in  accurately  distin-
guished REY speciation in coal ash. Speciation of relatively abundant
REY  such  as  Ce  and  Y  can  be  completed  using  synchrotron-based
XANES  on  either  the  bulk-  or  micro-scale.  However,  the  similar
spectral features of reference materials restrict the results to qualitive
descriptions.  TEM  is  useful  in  analyzing  nanometer-scale  REY-
bearing  domains,  which  may  differ  considerably  from  macro-  and
micro-scale REY hosts.

• The contents and reserve of REY in coal ash are the primary factor
determining the extraction potentials of REY from fly ash. This study
updates  the  reported  value  from  Ketris  and  Yudovich  [82],  which
was  obtained  based  on  the  REY  contents  in  coal.  Rather,  current
work compiled data of 581 coal ashes produced at coal-fired power
plants from 15 countries around the world. The estimated average
REY  contents  in  world  coal-derived  fly  ash  are  435.4  μg  g-1.  The
concentration of REY in coal ash greatly varies, which heavily de-
pends on the geological origin of feed coal. REY contents in Chinese
coal ash (473 μg g-1) and U.S. coal ash (459.61 μg g-1) are higher than
those in European (278.65 μg g-1) and other countries (298 μg g-1).
Coal-derived fly ashes from China and U.S. are two typical examples
showing the variations of REY with feed coal origins. In comparison
to  coal  ash  from  other  regions,  the  central  Appalachian  basin
coal-derived  ashes  and  southwestern  China  coal  ashes  are  signifi-
cantly enriched REY, providing three times the critical REY of total
REY extracted per kg than that of conventional ores.

• The speciation of REY in coal ash is another key factor affecting the
extraction efficiencies of REY from coal ash. This study classifies the
speciation  of  REY  in  coal  ash  as  amorphous  glassy  associations,
discrete  REY  minerals  or  compounds, and  as  REY  bound  with  un-
burned carbon. Rare earth elements are mostly found to be associ-
ated  with  aluminosilicate  glass  in  coal  ash.  Two  possible  forms
account for the Si-Al glassy associations, i.e., individual REY-bearing
phases that are closely bound with aluminosilicate glasses and REY
dispersed throughout the fly ash glass. The former association has
been extensively demonstrated via electron microscopy observations
or synchrotron-based XANES analysis. Direct determinations by the
means  of  ion  microprobe  indicate  that  REY  in  fly  ash  samples  is
dispersed  into  Si-Al  glasses  formed  during  melting  at  boiler  tem-
peratures.  Discrete  REY  minerals  are  usually  more  difficult  to  be
detected in coal ash than that in coal, with particle size ranging from
several microns to ~nm, or even to sub-nanometers (as shown by
TEM). The association of REY with unburned carbon is difficult to be
distinguished. Only nanosized particles containing REY are found in
amorphous and graphitic carbons surrounding Al-Si glass and Fe-rich
particles in fly ashes.

• Rare earth elements and yttrium are not volatile elements; and their
mass distributions among different emission streams in power plants
show  an  enrichment  in  the  combustion  ash,  especially  in  fly  ash.
There  is  no  significant  REY  fractionation  among  different  ESP  fly
ashes  or  in  the  sized  ash  based  on  their  normalized  distribution
pattern  relative  to  the  upper  continental  crust  (UCC).  However,  a
significant variation in the light REE versus heavy REE is noted be-
tween ESP rows and among sized fractions of fly ashes. Variations in
the  amount  and  size  of  REY  minerals  between  and  in  the
microscopically-identifiable  fly  ash  constituents  can  contribute  to
the differences in REY contents across the ash-collection array.

• The speciation of REY in coal can be greatly altered during and after
coal combustion. The thermally stable REY-bearing minerals, such as
phosphates, silicates, etc. in coal may not melt at boiler but, instead,
shatter into very fine grains. Thermal decomposition and oxidation
of  REY-organic  compounds,  REY  carbonates,  water-bearing  REY
phosphates and sulfates, and other minerals have been observed in
both  pure  mineral  combustion  experiments  and  direct  XANES  de-
terminations. Most of REY is retained in aluminosilicate glass with
very  few  REY  phases  emitted  as  gaseous  forms.  The  heat-induced
fragmented  REY  minerals,  neo-formed  minerals,  or  the  original
REY  minerals  in  coal  are  partitioned  into  the  Al-Si  glass  by  two
mechanisms: the incorporation of the individual REY phases into the
glass as inclusions and the diffusion of REE phases throughout Si-Al
glass  structures  in  the  melting  process.  The  retention  of  REY  by
aluminosilicate  glass  is  controlled  by  the  feed-coal  mineral  types,
mineral-mineral  associations,  boiler  conditions,  etc.  After  coal
combustion at boiler temperatures, the speciation of REY in may be
further influenced and modified by the reactions of REY phases with
flue gas components.

• REY  recovery  from  coal  combustion  ash  normally  requires  harsh
conditions because of the encapsulation of REY-rich particles in the
glassy matrix. Various methods have been tested in existing studies,
such as physical beneficiation, roasting, alkaline leaching, and acid
leaching. Based on the review, using physical beneficiation first to
generate concentrates with higher REY content followed by hydro-
metallurgical processing can improve the economic viability of the
recovery.

9. Problems and future outlooks

• A number of works have been devoted to the REY contents in coal,
but  the  contents  in  coal  ash,  especially  the  REY  contents  in  the
ponded  ash  are  not  known.  Portable  XRF  has  been  developed  for

screening coal ashes for REY recovery in field survey, but its preci-
sion and accuracy should be further improved.

• While a number of techniques have been used to determine the REY
associations in coal or coal ash, methods that can be used for quan-
tifying  various  REY  associations  in  coal  or  coal  ash  should  be
developed. The quantification of REY minerals in coal by CCSEM is a
good start, but the size and the trace amounts of REY phases (at ~ μg
g-1  or sub-μg g-1  level) in heterogenous coal ash make the quantifi-
cation results unsatisfactory.

• The  current  TEM  studies  observed  the  nanosized  REY  inclusions
occurring in the bituminous coal-derived fly ash. More research and
studies are needed for confirming those associations by extending the
work to higher and lower coal ranks.

• Current studies have investigated the high-temperature reactions of
pure REY species are limited to below 1000 °C and in an air atmo-
sphere, future work on behavior of the main REY species in coal at a
wider  temperature  range,  a  more  oxidizing  and  reducing  atmo-
sphere,  and  in  the  presence  of  acid  gas  components  should  be
expanded to modeling the REY transformation behavior.

• One of the main reasons for a lower extraction efficiency of REY from
coal ash in particular Class F fly ash is that most of REY partitioned
into aluminosilicate glasses in the combustion process. The ash glass
reactivities including their dissolution rates and chemical durability
are  determined  by  the  fly  ash  glass  structures  and  compositions.
Initial fundamental work on the diffusion of REY into glasses in coal
ash should determine what types of glasses host REY in coal ash and
the  formation  conditions,  with  consideration  of  the  effects  of
mineral-coal and mineral-mineral associations.

• Recovery of REY from coal combustion ash is viable from a technical
point of view per existing studies; however, the economic viability of
REY  recovery  from  coal  combustion  ash  has  not  been  sufficiently
assessed. More efforts are required to evaluate capital and operating
expenses to generate a certain quantity of REY. Moreover, REY re-
covery  needs  to  be  combined  with  other  beneficial  uses  of  coal
