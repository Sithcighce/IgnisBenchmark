Oxy-fuel combustion has received significant attention because it is widely considered to be a promising
method for cost-effective CO2 capture. The key to the success of oxy-fuel combustion processes is the avail-
ability of inexpensive O2. Therefore, development of low-cost and robust technologies for air separation or
separating O2 from air is critical. Great progress has been made in this research and development area.
However, a recent review of the progress made in the area is lacking. This review is designed to fill the gap.
The review focuses on three major technologies for separating oxygen from air, including membranes,
adsorption, and chemical-looping with oxygen uncoupling. The separation principles, characteristics, chal-
lenges and the associated solutions of these major technologies are systematically discussed. Future oppor-
tunities are outlined for each.

1. Introduction

POxygen is widely used in industry in numerous ways, with some
primary applications related to combustion and gasification [1].
Although air is frequently used as an oxidizer, the nitrogen in air can
have negative impacts on combustion processes. Essentially, the
heat absorbed by nitrogen during combustion is wasted through
thermodynamic cycles, despite efforts at heat recovery, and often
will form harmful NOx compounds. Combustion processes can thus
be improved by lowering the amount of nitrogen used in the com-
bustion air and increasing the amount of oxygen [2]. Although
increasing oxygen concentration would lead to higher adiabatic
flame temperature, in actual applications, oxygen is diluted by recir-
culated CO2 so as to control the temperature to the required level set
by boiler metallurgical constraints. The benefits of combustion in
oxygen include higher combustion efficiencies due to lower heat
loss, easier CO2 capture due to very high CO2 concentration in the
flue gas, lower NOx emissions, and improved temperature stability
[3].

PAlthough alternative energy technologies such as solar and wind
energy are emerging and under rapid development in recent years,
advanced combustion technologies will remain highly relevant in
the next few decades. In the U.S., approximately 83% of greenhouse
gas emissions are produced from the combustion and nonfuel uses
of fossil fuels, which currently supply over 85% of the energy needs
in both the United States and other nations [4]. CO2 emission mitiga-
tion options include the development of higher efficiency power
generation cycles and equipment, the use of less carbon-intensive
fuels, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) [5].

PPost-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion are the
three major carbon capture technologies. Post-combustion capture,
which uses chemical absorption/desorption processes with amines
to scrub CO2 directly from the exhaust, is the primary conventional
method [6]. Since post-combustion capture units are installed as
“add-ons” at the exit of the flue gas stack, the upstream power plant
does not require significant modification [6]. However, due to the
low CO2 concentrations typical of hydrocarbon oxidation in air [5]
and thermal energy requirements for chemical scrubbing processes,
among other factors [7], post-combustion capture is both energy-
intensive and expensive. Pre-combustion capture is an alternative
CCS technology that essentially removes carbon from the fuel prior
to combustion via processes such as steam reforming, partial oxida-
tion, or auto-thermal reforming, and transfers part of the chemical
bond energy stored in the original hydrocarbon into pure hydrogen
[8,9]. This method requires complex processing equipment and
incurs exergetic losses for each conversion into another chemical
form, thus making it expensive, and barriers to commercial applica-
tion of gasification are common to pre-combustion capture [6].

PIn contrast to pre- and post-combustion techniques, oxy-com-
bustion is a promising CCS technology with the potential to

Psignificantly reduce the penalty associated with the CO2 separation
process. Along with significant CCS cost reduction compared to post-
combustion capture, the International Energy Agency (IEA) pre-
sented a technology roadmap for oxy-fuel combustion in coal-fired
power plants using CO2 capture [10], with clear indication that this
technology can be commercialized by 2020. In oxy-combustion, fuel
is oxidized in a nearly nitrogen-free, CO2 diluted mixture such that
the products consist mainly of CO2 and water vapor, thus enabling a
relatively simple and inexpensive condensation separation process
[6]. However, oxy-combustion requires the separation of oxygen
from air prior to combustion.

PSince high-purity oxygen (O2) is required for both technologies,
air separation units are required for both pre-combustion and oxy-
combustion systems. Although all three major carbon capture
approaches are highly important in CCS technology, this article
focuses mainly on air separation methods related to oxy-combus-
tion. Fig. 1 presents a typical oxy-combustion system. In oxy-com-
bustion, the concentration of CO2 in the flue gas can reach more
than 80% (flue gas consists mainly of CO2 and water, with addi-
tional components including particulates, SOx, and NOx) and after a
simple purification process can exceed 95%, to meet the needs of
large-scale transfer and storage via pipeline. Not only can this tech-
nology facilitate the recovery of CO2 in flue gas, it can also greatly
reduce SO2 and NOx emissions in order to achieve the synergistic
removal of pollutants for near-zero emissions in clean coal utiliza-
tion technology.

PIn addition, CO2 sequestration in geologic formations shows
promise because of the large number of potential geologic sinks [4].
Also, with higher petroleum prices, there is increased interest in
using CO2 flooding for enhanced oil recovery; and with higher natu-
ral gas prices, there will be growing interest in using CO2 for
increased coal bed methane production [4]. However, none of these
activities would be possible in the first place unless CO2 were cap-
tured. Hence, in order to capture CO2 effectively, oxygen is essential.
POxygen also plays a very important role in coal gasification [1,11]
by enhancing the efficiency of the gasifier and downstream pro-
cesses [12]. Because of the high operating pressures of these pro-
cesses, economics favor the use of oxygen purities of 90% or higher
[13]. In contrast, when coal burns or is reacted in air, 79% of which is
nitrogen (N2), the resulting CO2 is diluted and more costly to sepa-
rate. Thus, improved air separation methods are vital if all these ben-
efits in combustion and gasification are to be realized.

2. Oxygen separation methods

PTo meet the needs of large-scale oxy-fuel combustion technolo-
gies, cryogenic air separation (CAS, also known as cryogenic distilla-
tion) is currently the most feasible technique for producing oxygen,
nitrogen, and argon as either gaseous or liquid products [14]. This
technique relies on fractional distillation of air at low temperature

Pand pressure for separation. In other words, air is separated accord-
ing to the different boiling temperatures of its components. An air
separation unit (ASU) using a conventional, multi-column cryogenic
distillation process produces oxygen from compressed air at high
rates of recovery and purity. For a given separation method, the
energy requirement is usually proportional to the recovery, since
this parameter is related to the flow of air required by thermal
power. An increase in the air excess requires more power consump-
tion, which penalize the energetic efficiency of the process. At pres-
ent, cryogenic plants producing up to > 150 tons/day of O2 have
been developed. Typical state-of-the-art CAS units produce oxygen
with a purity of 99.5% by volume at an oxygen recovery rate of
97.85% [15].

PHowever, the compression of air and fractional distillation of the
components are highly energy-intensive, representing about 85% of
the energy consumption in the entire air separation unit [16].
Approximately 3 ¡ 4% additional energy penalty is caused by using a
CAS unit for oxygen production for the oxy-fuel process and the cap-
ital cost of CAS-based systems accounts for about 14% of the total
oxy-fuel plant [17]. For oxy-fuel combustion, gaseous oxygen is
needed. Therefore, the compression energy requirement associated
with liquefaction of the product can be partially recovered with an
advanced CAS unit specifically designed for oxy-fuel combustion.
Generally, a CAS unit can consume between 10(cid:1)40% of the gross
power output for an oxy-fuel combustion plant. If the presence of Ar
in the oxygen product with a lower purity of oxygen of »95% is
acceptable for oxy-fuel combustion, then the electrical energy
requirement for oxygen production will be reduced from »350 to
»200 kWh/ton of O2, which accounts for 60(cid:1)70% of the additional
energy consumption needed for a new plant [18,19]. Due to the
highly integrated cryogenic process design, potential approaches for
thermal integration of a CAS unit into an oxy-fuel steam power plant
are limited to heat of compression recovery and perhaps advanced
flue gas heat recovery [20].

PDespite their complicated design, commercial cryogenic units
have low Second Law efficiencies in the range of 15(cid:1)24% [18], which
results in a First Law efficiency loss of up to 8.5% compared to a typi-
cal natural gas combined cycle power plant without CCS [21]. There-
fore, although cryogenic air separation is a mature and reliable
technology suitable for large-scale air separation, the economic pen-
alties remain a major obstacle. Moreover, because cryogenic tech-
nology is mature, it is therefore less likely to achieve significant
future cost reductions from technology improvements, prompting
many researchers to investigate the use of alternative air separation
systems [22].

POne such alternative approach is to use polymeric membranes or
ion transport membranes (ITM). Polymeric membranes exploit dif-
ferent oxygen and nitrogen diffusion rates through a membrane that
separates high-pressure and low-pressure process streams [1]. ITMs
are solid inorganic oxide ceramic materials that also act as mem-
branes by allowing oxygen ions to pass through the ceramic crystal
structure. Oxygen molecules are converted to oxygen ions at the sur-
face of the membrane, then are transported through the membrane
by an applied electric voltage or oxygen partial pressure difference,
ultimately reforming as oxygen molecules after passing through the
membrane material [1].

PThe use of membranes in gas separation processes is predicted to
increase by a factor of five by 2020 [9], and many studies are cur-
rently being conducted to improve their chemical stability and per-
formance under more demanding operational conditions [23].
Moreover, Air Products has fabricated small-scale (500 kg O2 per
day) modular ITM units that cost 35% less and require up to 60% less
energy per kg of O2 than conventional large-scale cryogenic systems
[9]. Membrane separation methods are simple and economical com-
pared to cryogenic methods, but reliable membranes are rare and
thermodynamic penalties must be addressed. ITM systems operate

Pat relatively high temperatures and rely on a difference in oxygen
chemical potential to drive the separation process [24]. This technol-
ogy still needs further development before widespread implementa-
tion in the commercial power generation sector.

PPressure swing adsorption (PSA) and temperature swing adsorp-
tion (TSA), two alternative approaches for separating oxygen from
air, provide separation without liquefaction. Adsorption separation
is based on the principle that, because nitrogen is more polarizable
than oxygen, a sorbent can selectively adsorb nitrogen, thereby
allowing oxygen gas to pass without restriction. PSA operates at
ambient temperature, making it economical, and easy to apply with
low energy consumption. While cryogenic distillation is suited for
large-scale operations, PSA and TSA technologies are presently best
suited for small and medium-sized production, and have already
enjoyed significant development in small-scale applications, includ-
ing the pulp and paper industry and medical applications, such as
oxygen production in the home for patients with lung disease [25].
Some major difficulties remain to be solved for large-scale applica-
tion, including limited adsorbent capacity, which leads to decreased
purity at larger gas flow rates.

PTo reduce the oxygen production cost in oxy-fuel combustion
and coal gasification processes and to make the CO2 available for
use, a novel technique based on chemical-looping with oxygen
uncoupling (CLOU), also known as chemical-looping air separation
(CLAS), has developed quickly in the last ten years. CLOU/CLAS offers
the advantage of significantly lower capital costs and reduced oper-
ating costs of 40(cid:1)70%, compared to conventional oxygen production
technologies [26]; further, recycling CO2 separated from gasification
or flue gases using carbon capture could not only promote oxygen
production of CLOU systems, but also enhance the coal gasification
process through the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 þ CÐ2CO)
[27]. CLAS developed originally from chemical-looping combustion
(CLC) because CLC suffers from several drawbacks, including the
requirements for an oxygen production unit, a larger reactor volume,
and a carbon stripper, as well as issues with solids handling, CO2
capture efficiency, and SOx emissions. Therefore, CLOU/CLAS was
proposed as a step-change solution. CLAS is similar to CLC, but the
mechanism of fuel conversion is different when oxygen gas is pro-
duced during the process via a metal oxide carrier material, which
could result in significant advantages with respect to fuel conversion
rates.

PMembrane separation and pressure and temperature swing
adsorption to produce oxygen have been the primary competing
methods compared to industrial cryogenic air separation, while
chemical-looping with oxygen uncoupling is a novel and highly
promising oxygen production method that garnered increased
attention in the last ten years. All three technologies will be dis-
cussed in greater detail below. Other commercial technologies, such
as water electrolysis, have only been used for very small-scale appli-
cations, and a variety of new oxygen generation techniques (e.g.,
ceramic auto-thermal recovery) are still at the laboratory stage,
which will not be considered in this review.

2.1. Membranes

P2.1.1. Polymeric membranes

PPolymeric membranes have received the most attention due to
their advantages: high selectivity between gases, good mechanical
properties, and economical processing capability [9,28(cid:1)30]. These
polymers can be modified with ease by various substituents and
insertion of metal cations such as Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, production of co-
polymers, or carbon membranes produced by pyrolysis of polymer
precursors [31(cid:1)34]. While glassy polymers often possess adequate
selectivity, their permeability requires improvement. However, their
application to separation processes under harsh conditions is

PProduction of pure O2 is more difficult because a small quantity of
N2 always permeates through the membranes, which results in oxy-
gen enriched air rather than pure O2. Since the practical enrichment
limit for one-stage membrane air separation is around 40% O2, a
two-stage membrane separation is often used to increase the perme-
ate O2 purity [41]. The volume of gas sent to the second-stage sepa-
rator is usually one-third to one-quarter of the volume entering the
first-stage unit; since the gas is more concentrated, the second-stage
is much smaller, with lower capital cost.

P2.1.2. Mixed matrix membranes

PAlong with process improvements, material advances have
received much attention in recent years. A very promising strategy
for improving mass transport through polymer films is the incorpo-
ration of inorganic materials, such as zeolites and carbon-based
molecular sieves, which are good candidates for the preparation of
inorganic membranes due to their molecular sieving property, ther-
mal resistance, and chemical stability [42(cid:1)47]. This new class of
membrane materials is called mixed matrix membranes (MMMs)
and offers significant potential improvements in membrane separa-
tion technology. These membranes combine the advantages of the
selectivity of the fillers and the simplicity of polymer membrane
processing [48]. The successful application of MMMs depends
mainly on the polymer matrix selection, the inorganic filler, and the
interaction between these two phases [49].

POver the past dozen years, much work has been done on MMMs.
Pechar et al. dispersed zeolite L in a matrix of 6FDA ¡ 6FpDA ¡ DABA
polyimide and demonstrated that the resulting membranes dis-
played increased permeability, although without
substantial
improvements in selectivity [50]. Sen et al. investigated the effect of
zeolite loading on the performance of polycarbonate (PC)/zeolite 4A
membranes [48]. Permeability levels decreased with zeolite loading
and were lower than the pure polycarbonate membrane. As opposed
to the permeability, selectivity performance was higher than that of
pure polycarbonate membranes. Dual-layer polyethersulfone (PES)/
P84 hollow fiber membranes with a PES/zeolite b mixed matrix
dense selective layer were successfully fabricated by Li et al. [51].
The dual-layer hollow fibers exhibited around 10 ¡ 20% enhanced
O2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity compared to those of the dense PES
films.

PRecent research has shown that the interfacial region, which is
the transition phase between the polymer and inorganic phases, is
of particular importance [49]. The interaction between the polymer

Pdifficult because glassy polymeric membranes are susceptible to
plasticization and thermal instability [35(cid:1)37].

PA general polymeric membrane based air separation is schemati-
cally depicted in Fig. 2. The feed gas is passed across the membrane
surface under a pressure driving force [38]. The permeate is the gas
that penetrates through the membrane and comes out as the low-
pressure stream. The retentate is the remaining gas that exits as the
high-pressure stream. Both permeate and retentate can be used if
they meet the desired product purities.

PThere are a number of mechanisms for gas separation in mem-
branes [38]. Knudson diffusion occurs when gas components are
separated based on the difference in the mean free path of the gas
molecules. Molecular sieving, which is based on size exclusion, and
solution-diffusion, which is based on the solubility of gas molecules
within a membrane and their diffusion through the dense mem-
brane matrix, are two other mechanisms. The last one is the typical
separation mechanism for polymeric membranes used for air sepa-
ration. These three mechanisms are shown schematically in Fig. 3.

PAccording to Fick's 1st law, a relationship exists between
throughput, membrane area, membrane thickness, and driving
force; namely, that the flux of gas passing per unit time and unit
area is proportional to the pressure difference across the membrane,
but inversely proportional to membrane thickness [39]. Given the
permeability coefficient, px, the pressure difference of upstream and
downstream chambers, Pb ¡ Pl, and the membrane thickness, l, the

Pand the inorganic material is of concern, as undesirable channels
may be created between both phases if the polymer chains do not
completely interact with the inorganic phase, which may deteriorate
the gas separation performance of the membranes. Li et al. demon-
strated that the adhesion between zeolite A and the polyethersul-
fone matrix could be improved by modifying the zeolite surface
with a (3-aminopropyl) diethoxymethyl silane (APDEMS) coupling
agent [52]. Both the permeability and the selectivity of MMMs made
from the modified zeolite were higher than those of MMMs made
from the unmodified zeolite at 20 wt% zeolite loading because of a
decrease in the degree of partial pore blockage of the zeolite. Li et al.
also pointed out that using a large pore-size zeolite for MMMs would
potentially offset the negative effects of partial pore blockage and
polymer chain rigidification on permeability. Clarizia et al. compared
APDEMS with other coupling agents [53]. Diethanolamine, being a
smaller coupling agent than APDEMS, was more effective for reduc-
ing the void between the zeolite and the polymer. The success of
Grignard-treated zeolites in the polymer matrix indicated that cou-
pling of the polymer to the sieve surface was not necessary for suc-
cessful MMM formation [54].

PFunk and Lloyd introduced the concept of zeolite-filled micropo-
rous MMMs and discussed their potential use for gas separations
[55]. Such membranes address the drawbacks of both zeolite films
and dense mixed matrix membranes by providing a porous matrix
for the zeolite particles, allowing only the particles to participate in
the separation. Permeation modeling of microporous MMMs showed
potential for improvement over dense MMM performance [55]. Chen
et al. merged the mixed matrix concept with a nonsolvent-induced
phase separation system and formed porous polysulfone (PSF)
matrix membranes with different zeolite 4A contents [28]. The per-
meation properties of porous MMMs were highly dependent on the
zeolite content; the introduction of zeolite particles distorted the
closed pores in the PSF matrix and formed nonselective voids, which
resulted in very high oxygen flux, but low O2/N2 selectivity. On the
other hand, annealing temperature significantly changes the micro-
structure of porous MMMs. Increasing the annealing temperature
decreases gas permeability of oxygen, but improves the O2/N2 selec-
tivity [29]. Thus, a comprehensive consideration of permeation and
selectivity is required for a set annealing temperature. Although
MMM materials are expensive and difficult to process as mem-
branes, deficiencies in either polymeric or purely molecular sieving
media suggest the need for this hybrid approach to develop mem-
branes for gas separation and achieve better material processing to
improve MMMs.

PAnother improvement could be to provide differentiated condi-
tions (other than sorption(cid:1)diffusion) in mass transport between the
oxygen and the nitrogen, such as application of a magnetic field,
which actively influences the oxygen and nitrogen transport. This
difference in magnetic properties of oxygen (paramagnetic) and
nitrogen (diamagnetic) was used previously only in magneto-
responsive colloidal systems [56(cid:1)58]. Rybak et al. worked on poly-
mer membranes prepared from ethylcellulose (EC) and poly (2,6-
dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) filled with neodymium pow-
der or iron oxides for oxygen air enrichment [59(cid:1)61]. They found
that incorporation of magnetic powder (MQP-0) improved the trans-
port properties of EC and PPO membranes. They also worked on
another type of magnetic powder (MQP-14-12) and different poly-
mer matrices (LPI and HBPI) known to be highly selective and stable.
The new material showed acceptable selectivity with good thermo-
oxidative stability; adding magnetic powder and increasing the
magnetic field increased permeability, with additional slight
increases in selectivity and sorption as well.

P2.1.3. Ceramic ion transport membranes

PHigh temperature ceramic membranes are generally used for ion
transport membrane (ITM) units. For ITMs, oxygen ions are

Ptransported from the high oxygen-concentration side (also called
the “feed”) to the low oxygen-concentration side (also called the
“permeate”). Alternative names for ITMs include “mixed conducing
membranes” and “oxygen transport membranes.”

PIn order to diffuse through the membrane, oxygen must first be
incorporated into the crystal lattice structure of the material [24,62].
Oxygen is adsorbed on a porous, electrically conductive coating that
is applied to the surface of the membrane. The oxygen dissociates to
form oxygen ions, which are transported through the non-porous
ceramic electrolyte. The oxygen dissociates to form oxygen ions,
which are transported through the non-porous ceramic electrolyte.
Once through the membrane, the oxygen ions lose electrons, form-
ing molecular oxygen, which is then desorbed from the membrane's
surface, as shown in Fig. 4 [62]. Oxygen flux is usually obtained by
imposing a driving force across the membrane. The driving force can
be either an electrical potential gradient or a partial pressure gradi-
ent. For some materials that provide only ionic conductivity, electro-
des are needed to complete the electron pathway for charge
compensation. For mixed ionic-electronic membranes, no electrodes
are required, although an oxygen pressure difference on both sides
of the membrane is needed to operate [23].

PGenerally, ITMs are composed of specific combinations of inor-
ganic compounds with particular crystal lattice structures, such as
perovskite or fluorite [23], and are often called mixed oxygen ionic
and electronic conducting (MIEC) membranes. In order to achieve
better performance and operational life, the membrane material
requires certain properties, especially high oxygen flux, good mate-
rial strength at high temperature, good resistance to system contam-
inants such as sulfur, and amenability to standard ceramic
processing techniques that facilitate the design and manufacture of
multi-layer, planar wafer structures [23].

PThin membranes maximize oxygen flux, as the flux is inversely
proportional to the thickness of the membrane, but are susceptible
to mechanical failure. Thus, thin film synthesis on porous substrates
is the preferred method so as to provide mechanical strength with-
out significantly decreasing the flux [23]. Due to differences in ther-
mal expansion coefficients that may lead to cracks and mechanical
instability of these supported thin film membranes, a clever idea is
to use a porous substrate made from the same material as the thin
film to eliminate the compatibility problems. Other possible
improvements include dual-phase membranes and membrane sur-
faces and chemical and structural modifications.

PCommon membrane materials include perovskites and fluorites
[23]. Perovskites are typified by the cubic crystal structure of cal-
cium titanium oxide, with chemical formula CaTiO3 or generically,
ABO3. A1+B5+O3, A2+B4+O3, and A3+B3+O3 are the most common

Pperovskite combinations, with CaTiO3 being an A2+B4+O3 type.
Ceramic membranes containing such compounds are called perov-
skite membranes [63]. Imperfections or defects within the perov-
skite structure are highly important, because the ideal, non-
defective perovskite structure, shown in Fig. 5 [63], cannot conduct
oxide ions. The presence of defects or oxygen vacancies is necessary
for conduction or diffusion to occur. Generally, the stability of the
perovskite structure is improved by B-site doping to produce AB1-
xBnew,xO3-d with a more stable cation, Bnew. The term d denotes the
number of vacancies or defects. The higher the number of oxygen
vacancies, the higher the oxygen permeation flux.

PBecause of their theoretically infinite selectivity for oxygen, MIEC
membranes have potential application in air separation; however,
proper selection of effective doping strategies is vital to improve the
physical properties of perovskite membrane materials that produce
excellent oxygen flux.

PSrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d (SCF) [64] exhibits a high oxygen permeation flux
of 2.3 £ 10¡6 mol/s cm2 under an air/He oxygen mixture at 850 °C.
Due to the high oxygen permeation flux of SCF, its conductivity, oxy-
gen permeability, surface exchange kinetics, and stability properties
have been widely investigated [65]. However, SCF exhibits poor
chemical and structural stability at low oxygen partial pressure con-
ditions. Shao et al. developed Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d (BSCF) using
Ba to partially substitute Sr [71]. BSCF exhibits high oxygen perme-
ation and good stability for oxygen separation and the polyoxy-
methylene reaction [66,67]. SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d modified with ZrO2 or
yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has also been proven to have a high
oxygen permeation flux, stable structure, and high mechanical
strength [68], although a potential problem of a mismatch of the
thermal expansion coefficient between the two phases has not been
solved.

PTo further improve the stability of the membrane materials, cati-
ons with a single dominant oxidation state (e.g., Zr4+, Ga3+, and Al3+)
[69(cid:1)72] have been used to partially substitute the reducible B-site
ions (Co3+, Fe3+). Liu et al. [73] developed a novel perovskite-
type mixed-conducting membrane based on SrSc0.05Co0.95O3-d
with good oxygen permeability. Wu et al. [76] reported that
BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-d (BCFN) membranes showed a high and stable
oxygen permeation flux and that the structural stability of Co-
based perovskite membrane could be improved by Nb-doping
loss of the high oxygen
at the B-site without any substantial

ier).

Ppermeation. This supposition was verified in the SrCo1-yNbyO3-d
system, e.g. SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-d has a higher permeation flux than
Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d
and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d membranes under
similar operating conditions
[74,75]. A novel Ta-stabilized
BaCo0.7Fe0.2Ta0.1O3-d (BCFT) for oxygen permeation and partial oxi-
dation of methane (POM) [76] was also developed. BCFT exhibits
good oxygen permeation (around 1.18 £ 10¡6 mol/s cm2 at 950 °C
with a membrane thickness of 1.0 mm) and excellent stability
(more than 420 h long-term operation for POM). Chen et al.
used tantalum to partially dope the B-site of SrCoO3-d [77], and
indicated that the resulting SrCo0.9Ta0.1O3-d membrane exhibited
good structural stability and high oxygen permeation. They showed
that Ta doping concentration has a significant effect on the phase
structure of Sr(Co1-yTay)O3-d that alters both stability and oxygen
permeability.

PThe partial doping (e.g., by Zr4+, Cr3+/4+, Ti4+, and Nb5+) in the
B-site may significantly improve the structural stability of perovskite
materials [23,78]. When Lu et al. produced a Fe/Nb co-doped Sr
(Co0.8Fe0.1Nb0.1)O3-d using the solid-state reaction method, its struc-
tural stability improved significantly compared to that of Fe-doped
Sr(Co0.8Fe0.2)O3-d or (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8Fe0.2)O3-d oxides [79]. Among
the doped oxide materials explored, BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-d (BCFN)
was reported to be one of the most promising membrane materials,
with high oxygen permeability and superior structural stability. Kida
et al. demonstrated that surface modification of (Ba0.95La0.05)FeO3-d
membranes with (La1-xSrx)FeO3-d catalyst layers led to an increase in
oxygen permeation flux at 700(cid:1)930 °C [80].

PIn order

to enhance oxygen flux, He et al. developed
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d (LSCF) membranes impregnated with fluorite
phase Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) nanoparticles for highly efficient oxygen
separation membranes [81]. A sandwich structure, including a 4 mm
thick, dense LSCF layer prepared by drop-coating, was developed
as a simple and cost-effective method for thin membrane prepara-
tion. The surface exchange kinetics were enhanced by GDC impreg-
nation and the new structure showed significantly higher oxygen
separation performance (doubled O2 flux at 700 °C compared to
unmodified thin films and conventionally prepared membrane
disks).

PPreviously, MIEC perovskite membranes with high oxygen per-
meability have been discovered almost entirely among cobalt-
containing oxides, such as LaCoO3-d and (Ba/Sr)CoO3-d based perov-
skite materials [66,67,82]. However, recent reports have demon-
strated that the substitution of Sr or La by Ba in the A-site will lead
to a higher level of oxygen non-stoichiometry and increase the oxy-
gen permeation flux [82,83]. For example, Shao et al. studied the
effect of Ba partially substituting for Sr in the SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d
system and pointed out that Ba doping can significantly improve the
oxygen permeation rate [82]. Also, molecular oxygen is more easily
dissociated on the surface of BaCoO3 compared to Ba0.6La0.2CoO3-d
and Ba0.1La0.9CoO3-d [83]. Therefore, an effective way to improve
the stability of BaCoO3 is through proper doping at the B-site
[84(cid:1)87].

PThe operating temperature for a typical ITM is above 700 °C, with
the oxygen partial pressure difference across the membrane ranging
from 0.2 to a few bars [62]. Table 1 lists oxygen flux and operating
conditions available in the literature for some major ceramic mem-
brane materials. A comprehensive compilation of available oxygen
permeation data has been reported by Sunarso, et al [23]. and
Mancini and Mitsos [62]. The key results of this concise overview of
common membrane materials are the operating temperature, partial
pressure range, and the maximum oxygen flux.

PTo model a complicated membrane separation process without a
massive amount of computation, details such as the physical com-
plexity of the surface exchange reactions, bulk diffusion, and rela-
tionship to composition, structure, and operating conditions must
be captured concisely. An idealized equation for LSCF can be

P2.1.4. Integrated membrane process considerations

PAs mentioned previously, high-temperatures (well above 700 °C)
must be provided to operate an ITM unit. In a standard electrical
generation power plant, this heat can be supplied only by the flue
gases [20]. A general scheme for a membrane integrated oxy-fuel
combustion process is shown in Fig. 6 [96]. The oxygen, when sepa-
rated from air by the membrane, is carried by the sweep gas, CO2.
This mixture of CO2/O2 is then used for combustion because the
undiluted, purified oxygen would produce unacceptably high adia-
batic temperatures within the furnace. After combustion and purifi-
cation, the exhaust gas mainly consists of CO2. Part of the CO2 is

Precycled as the sweep gas and the rest is compressed for delivery
and storage [96].

PIn one concept, the recycled flue gas can serve two purposes
simultaneously, which are to provide the required thermal energy
for the membrane to operate and to enhance the oxygen flux by
sweeping the membrane. The Foster Wheeler Power Group [97] sug-
gested a design wherein the double role of the flue gas is uncoupled
in order to make use of a conventional flue gas treatment system
[20]. However, depending on the membrane material used, CO2 or
other impurities in the sweep gas can disrupt the oxygen flux, as
well as degrade the membrane.

PChen et al. demonstrated that degradation of SCF perovskite
membranes in a CO2 atmosphere was affected by the residual oxy-
gen partial pressure in the CO2 sweep gas and that the CO2 tolerance
of the membranes could be increased by increasing the oxygen par-
tial pressure [96]. They proposed a new design in which an extra
CO2/O2 recycle was introduced, with long-term oxygen permeation
tests at 950 °C showing that mixing 5% oxygen with the CO2 sweep
gas could prevent SCF membrane degradation without sacrificing its
high oxygen permeability. However, 17% of additional membrane
area is needed to achieve the same oxygen yield compared with
pure CO2 as sweep gas [96].

2.2. Adsorption

separation method. Adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions, gas

Pmolecules, liquid molecules, or dissolved solids to a surface [98].
This process creates a film of the adsorbate on the surface of the
adsorbent. The term ‘adsorption’ was first used by Kayser in 1881
[98]. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the
absorbate) permeates or is dissolved by a liquid or solid (the absor-
bent). Adsorption is a surface-based process, while absorption in a
bulk process involving the whole volume of the material. The
term sorption encompasses both processes, while desorption is its
opposite [99].

PSince competition of different molecules for the adsorbent sites
exists, the Langmuir adsorption equation is commonly used to deter-
mine the fractional coverage of each component on the adsorbent.
Suppose adsorption takes place through the reversible mechanism
Ag þ SÐAS

ðR1Þ

where A refers to a gas molecule and S refers to an adsorption site.
For a given temperature, the adsorption equilibrium constant, K, is
calculated by dividing the adsorption rate constant, k, by the desorp-
tion rate constant, k-1. If P is the partial pressure of the gas (or repre-
sents the molar concentration of the adsorbate in a solution) and
the fractional surface coverage, u, is defined as the fraction of the
adsorption sites occupied by A, then the relationship between u and
K at equilibrium can be expressed as

u 1⁄4 KP

ðE5Þ

PIn order to separate each component of a mixed gas, two require-
ments must be satisfied [100,101]. First, the sorbent must have non-
unity selectivity for the components of interest. Second, in order to
regenerate the sorbent for cyclic use, higher pressure must increase
the adsorption amount of a component, while lower pressure must
decrease the adsorption amount. This necessary cycling of the pres-
sure to first adsorb and then to regenerate the sorbent is the origin
of the term pressure swing adsorption (PSA).

PHowever, higher pressure tends to lead to a smaller separation
factor between components, resulting in selectivity closer to one.
Thus, standard adsorption pressures are just above atmospheric (0.2
to 0.7 MPa absolute), while the desorption pressure is usually at
atmospheric (0.1 MPa absolute). The working temperature is usually
maintained at ambient conditions, although sorbents for high-tem-
perature air separation are being studied for certain applications
[102]. If temperature differences are used to adsorb and desorb the
gas being separated, the process is then temperature swing adsorp-
tion (TSA), with low or ambient temperatures used during adsorp-
tion cycles and elevated temperatures used to regenerate the
sorbent.

PPSA/TSA processes have several advantages over other oxygen
production methods. They usually operate near ambient tempera-
ture and atmospheric pressure conditions, which saves energy com-
pared to the elevated temperature requirement of ion transport
membranes and the cryogenic cooling requirement of standard dis-
tillation. The major energy consumption of the process lies in the
compressor or blower, which operates at low pressure differentials,
making it less energy intensive than the high pressures followed by
expansions required to achieve cryogenic distillation. Also, fully

Pautomated operation can be achieved with PSA/TSA. Since required
concentrations can be achieved in a short period (usually within
minutes) within the adsorbent beds, fast response is also a benefit.
Other advantages include simplicity of facilities, as well as safe and
reliable operation [98]. However, selectivity values among O2, N2,
and Ar remain a major drawback that need vast advancement for
sorbent materials.

P2.2.1. Development and characterization of sorbents

PAdsorption processes are based on the preferential adsorption of
one gas relative to others, e.g. the adsorption of nitrogen preferen-
tially to oxygen to produce an enriched oxygen stream, on certain
natural and synthetic sorbent materials [1].

PFor PSA/TSA processes, zeolites are the most often used sorbent
materials. Zeolites are natural and synthetic minerals possessing
micro-porous silica-alumina crystalline structures that have pores of
molecular diameter. The shape-selective properties of zeolites are
the basis for their use in molecular adsorption. Further, non-uniform
electric fields exist in the void spaces of the material because of the
charge imbalance introduced by aluminum atoms substituted within
the silica framework of the crystal, causing the preferential adsorp-
tion of specific molecules which are more polarizable due to their
greater electrostatic quadrupole moments [103]. A cation, such as
hydrogen or sodium, is associated with the substituted aluminum
atoms to maintain electrical neutrality. When N2 is in close proxim-
ity to one of these exposed cations within the zeolite crystal, a
charge-induced dipole forms, attracting N2 to these sites in the zeo-
lite crystal [103]. Since N2 is more polarizable than O2, the zeolite
selectively adsorbs N2 and allows O2 gas to pass unrestricted. Thus,
in zeolite-based air separation, N2 molecules are more strongly
adsorbed than O2 molecules [104].

PZeolite structure types A, and X and Y, which are shown in
Figs. 7(a) and (b), respectively, have dominated commercial adsorp-
4¡ tet-
tion applications. The basic building block of zeolites are SiO4
rahedra. In these figures, each line intersection represents a silicon
(or a substituted aluminum) atom joined to their neighbors through
oxygen atoms that lie along the lines. Thus, each silicon (or alumi-
num) atom is at the center of a tetrahedron with four surrounding
oxygen atoms. The structures continue to repeat in space.

PAdsorption can be controlled by applying different types of zeo-
lites. The size of the various available windows or apertures and
pore structures and the amount of aluminum substitution for silicon
in the zeolite family of minerals determine the type of molecules
that each zeolite will adsorb [105].

(cid:3)

PFirst, separation and purification can be accomplished by simple
molecular sieving. The aperture size leading to the zeolite pores
decreases with temperature, and thus, for some molecules, molecu-
lar sieving occurs only below certain temperatures [106]. Take 4A
zeolite for example. The kinetic diameter of N2 is approximately
0.2 A
larger than O2. At temperatures below 100 °C, N2 is essentially
excluded, while Ar becomes excluded at below 150 °C [99]. A sche-
matic is given in Fig. 8 that shows the relationship between effective
pore sizes of selected zeolites (on the x axis) and the kinetic diame-
ters of various molecules (on the y axis) at two different tempera-
tures. This figure provides an idea of the possibilities available for
size exclusion separations under different temperature conditions.

PSecond, separation and purification can also be accomplished by
using differences in diffusivities, i.e., kinetic separation. In this case,
although both species being separated are able to enter the pores,
only one or predominantly one species adsorbs on the surface, while
the other continues to diffuse through the system. A potentially use-
ful approach for kinetic separation is to use partially ion-exchanged
zeolites.

PZeolite frameworks usually have a number of sites for the charge-
balancing cations that occupy them [99]. The cations are distributed
in a way that minimizes the free energy of the system. The

Pdistribution of the cations on the sites depends on the treatment
temperature, the cationic species, and the degree of hydration. Since
water molecules have a strong influence on the adsorption effect,
they are removed by drying prior to adsorption applications. There-
fore, only the highly dehydrated zeolite materials that are typically
used are discussed in this work.

(cid:3)

PThe most probable cation sites in type A zeolite are indicated by
the Roman numerals in Fig. 7(a). The unit cell of type A zeolite con-
tains 24 tetrahedra, 12 A1O4 and 12 SiO4. The free diameter in the
central cavity is 11.4 A
, which is accessible through six 8-member
oxygen-ring apertures with an unobstructed diameter of 4.4 A
[99].
Type A zeolites are synthesized in the sodium form, with 12 sodium
cations occupying all eight sites in I and three sites in II, plus one site
in III. The sodium form can be ion-exchanged by various other cati-
ons, including hydrogen ions. The commercial type 4A zeolite has an
effective aperture size of 3.8 A
, while type 3A zeolite is formed by
exchanging Na+ with K+, resulting in a smaller effective aperture
due to the larger K+. The aperture size of the sodium
size of 3.0 A
form can also be increased by exchanging Na+ with Ca2+ or Mg2+, as
2 Na+ are replaced by one divalent cation. Ca2+ or Mg2+ exchanged
type A is designated 5A, with a larger aperture size of 4.3 A

.

PSimilarly, the locations for the cations in zeolites X and Y are
shown in Fig. 7(b). Sites I, I’, and II’ are not exposed and are not avail-
able for interaction with adsorbate molecules, except water mole-
cules due to their small kinetic diameter (which is quantified in
Fig. 8). This fact makes nearly one-half of the cations unavailable
for adsorption. Sites II and III are exposed to the cavity and are

ious zeolites with different effective pore sizes at temperatures of 77 K (solid lines)

Passociated with the six- and four-member rings, respectively. Alkali
metal cations occupy both of these sites, but alkaline earth metal
cations tend to occupy site II only [99].

PIon exchange can be facilitated by adding metal cations to the
structure of the zeolite in order to attract certain molecules. Histor-
ically, calcium has been a common cation exchanged in zeolites,
but other materials such as silver-exchanged zeolites can be more
effective in O2 production [107]. The cation sites can be predicted
by calculating the cation-lattice interaction energies, which consist
of electrostatic, polarization, dispersion/repulsion, and charge-
transfer energies, with preference for sites with the highest ener-
gies [99]. This technique can also be used to predict the sites for
ion
zeolites with mixed cations that are obtained by partial
exchange. According to Yang [99], the site selectivity values deter-
mined for cations in type A zeolites are as follows: Li+, Na+, Ca2+,
and Sr2+ prefer six-ring sites (site I), whereas K+, Cs+, and Ba2+ pre-
fer the eight-ring sites (site II).

PWhen N2 and O2 are interacting with identical cation sites, the
interaction energies are similar because their sizes, polarizabilities,
and magnetic fields are quite similar. The main difference in the
total interaction energies comes from the quadrupole difference
because N2 has a much higher quadrupole moment than O2.
The interaction energy of the typical pairs O2 ¡ Li+, O2 ¡ Na+,
N2 ¡ Li+, and N2 ¡ Na+ are 32, 20, 51, and 36 kJ/mol, respectively.
For O2 interacting with Li+ and Na+, the difference of 12 kJ/mol is
caused by the different sizes of the ions, which results in the differ-
ence in the interaction energy [99].

PSignificant improvement in N2/O2 selectivity was observed by ion
exchange of Na+ with Li+ in LSX (low silica X type zeolite) [99]. LiLSX
with near 100% Li exchange has been the best sorbent used commer-
cially for O2 production during the past decade [99]. More recently, a
partially exchanged Ag+ LiLSX was reported to exhibit very strong
interactions with N2. LiLSX exchanged with only 1(cid:1)3% Ag+ exhibits
better performance compared to pure LiLSX in O2 production from
air by PSA [99]. Cost estimates suggest a significant gain is possible
using Ag-containing Li-LSX zeolite [99].

PIn many cases with PSA, however, oxygen product purities in
excess of 95% are difficult to achieve due to the presence of argon
(Ar) in air. Ar has almost identical adsorption equilibrium properties
as O2 [99]. Silver-exchanged zeolites, such as silver mordenite, sil-
ver-exchanged zeolite A, silver-exchanged zeolite X, and silver-
exchanged Li-Na-LSX have all been reported to show some degree of
Ar over O2 selectivity [99]. In 2013, Shi et al [108] demonstrated a
composite adsorbent of Ag-Engelhard titanosilicate-10 (ETS-10)
crystals and Ludox HS-40 colloidal silica, and obtained an adsorbent
with a high N2/O2 equilibrium selectivity of 6.23 and adsorption
capacity of 0.622 mol ¢ kg¡1 at standard conditions, with an

Air Products developed a low silica X zeolite, AgLiLSX, with a moder-
ate equilibrium selectivity of 4.98 for N2/O2 and 1.14 for Ar/O2 at

0.850 mol ¢ kg¡1 [109]. The high adsorption working capacity and
N2/O2 equilibrium selectivity at lower pressures, combined with the
reasonable Ar/O2 selectivity, suggest that zeolite AgLiLSX could be
useful for producing high-purity oxygen in a single-stage PSA unit.

and

PApart from the zeolite materials, carbon molecular sieves (CMS)
with a kinetic selectivity of O2 over Ar have been investigated and
employed for production of purified gases. CMS rely on the differ-
ence between oxygen and nitrogen adsorption speeds. Since CMS
have pore sizes on the same order of magnitude as the size of air
molecules, and oxygen has a smaller molecular diameter than nitro-
gen, oxygen diffuses more rapidly into the pores of the adsorbent
[110(cid:1)112]. Thus, CMS are especially selective to oxygen and, as a
result, produce enriched nitrogen, while zeolites are more selective
to nitrogen and therefore produce enriched oxygen [113].

PSpecifically, 5A (CaA) and 13X (NaX) zeolites have been the most
commonly used sorbents for O2 production in air separation [99].
Fig. 9 shows the adsorption isotherms of N2, O2, and Ar on zeolites
5A and 13X at 293.15 K, as reported by Mofarahi and Shokroo [103].
The isotherms imply that zeolites 5A and 13X have difficulty in sepa-
rating Ar from O2 because of their nearly identical adsorption
amounts [103]. However, the adsorption capacity of N2 is much
larger than that of either O2 or Ar, especially for zeolite 13X.

PFig. 10 shows the influence of feed flow rate on PSA unit perfor-
mance for the two types of zeolites. Oxygen purity decreases—
although oxygen recovery increases(cid:1)as the feed flow rate increases
[103]. Mofarahi and Shokroo speculate that the decrease in purity
may have resulted from the feed flow rate being too high, such that

Pthe different gas components did not equilibrate in the bed. The
figure also shows that oxygen purity levels were almost the same,
near the »95% upper limit, for these two types of zeolite when the
feed flow rate was low (less than about 23 nL/min) [103].

P2.2.2. Pressure swing adsorption process considerations

PWhile both PSA and TSA are widely used in industry, because TSA
is designed in a similar manner (with the exception that tempera-
ture change is adopted instead of pressure change for regeneration),
only the PSA process is discussed in detail in this work. The main
equipment required in PSA is a compressor, a filter/conditioner, two
parallel adsorption beds, and a storage vessel. The compressor is
needed to supply the required volume of atmospheric air that will
produce the desired purity and output flow rate of oxygen, to pro-
duce the necessary pressure change to achieve the pressure swing
effect, and to overcome the pressure drop through the system. The
filter is used to remove water vapor and impurities such as CO2 and
CO from the air prior to the adsorption beds. The storage vessel
allows for product storage for later use and minimizes or eliminates
supply disruptions as the swings between beds take place.

PStandard PSA operation usually involves five steps, namely
adsorption, pressure equalization, blowdown (to begin regenera-
tion), purge, and re-pressurization [104,114]. During the adsorption
step, a gas mixture (e.g., air) first flows into one sorbent tower, and
undergoes an adsorption process at a certain elevated pressure. The
pressure equalization step then follows, as the saturated tower and
the other purged tower (ready to be put into adsorption service) are
pressure-balanced in order to re-gain some oxygen, which is also
beneficial for increasing oxygen concentration [100]. (Leavitt et al
[115]. discuss the effectiveness of the pressure equalization step.) In
the subsequent blowdown step, the pressure of the saturated tower
is reduced further to desorb most of the adsorbed nitrogen through
the vent. The purge step then uses a portion of the oxygen product
to purge the tower and fully regenerate it. An oxygen purge is used
to achieve higher purity and recovery rates of the product [116]. The
final step involves re-pressurization to prepare the tower for a new
adsorption-desorption cycle. Thus, the two sorbent towers alternate
between adsorption and regeneration steps to produce nearly con-
tinuous product flow.

PThe most widely used designs are two, three, or four-bed PSA,
and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), which can increase production
capacities and recoveries. The first two-bed PSA was designed by
Skarstorm in 1957 [117]. An example of the design of a two-bed PSA
is shown in Fig. 11 [118]. While the first sorbent bed adsorbs and
produces oxygen at the outlet, the second bed is depressurized dur-
ing the blowdown process. The cycle is completed when the second
bed is re-pressurized to the required conditions for adsorption. The
main advantage of the two-bed technique is that the process is sim-
ple, making it easy to operate. However, it is unable to produce oxy-
gen continuously, and buffer vessels must be used in order to
produce a stable flow of oxygen.

PSeveral studies reported that most of the PAS systems for O2
separation using zeolite molecular sieves showed 90(cid:1)93% purity
with > 50% recovery or > 95% purity with below 30% recovery
[104,112]. Further purifications based on oxygen enriched air can
result in much higher recovery. Jee et al. [118] reported 98.0(cid:1)99.9%
O2 purity and 56(cid:1)66% recovery when feed flow has 95% O2. Tian
et al. [119] investigated on the performance of a dual-reflux PSA pro-
cess and O2 purity was enriched to 99.1% with a recovery of 98%.

PAnother important contribution to the two-bed process was first
provided by Guerin De Montgareuil et al. [120]. Called the Guerin-
Domine cycle, this was a PSA process based on VSA (often referred
to as vacuum pressure swing adsorption or VPSA). The main differ-
ence between Skarstorm's method and Guerin's lies in the use of
vacuum during desorption. The adsorption process works at near

Pambient pressure, and then swings to a vacuum for desorption to
regenerate the adsorbent material.

PThe alternatives to the two-bed PSA are three-bed or four-bed
designs, implemented in order to produce a continuous flow of oxy-
gen, as well as to increase the recovery rate of oxygen during multi-
bed processes. The main idea is to always keep one bed active in the
adsorption step. However, the systems become more complicated
and challenging to operate when more beds are involved. Thus,
multi-bed systems require more detailed analysis to ensure stability
and to minimize complexity [121].

2.3. Chemical looping

P2.3.1. Oxygen production mechanism

PCLAS is another oxygen production technology to burn solid fuels
in gas-phase oxygen without the need for a highly energy-intensive
process. It differs from the chemical looping combustion technology
in that the fuel does not have to react directly with the metal oxides.
The process uses two interconnected fluidized bed reactors, an air
reactor (AR) and a fuel reactor (FR). The oxygen carrier is typically a
metal oxide, which decomposes in the fuel reactor to release gas
phase oxygen. The reduced oxygen carrier is then transported to the
air reactor where it reacts with the oxygen to reform the original
metal oxide for recirculation back to the FR [122], as shown in
Fig. 12.

PWithin the fuel reactor, the oxygen carrier releases oxygen
through the decomposition of the oxidized form of the metal oxide,
generically MexOy-2, via reaction R2:
MexOy $ MexOy(cid:1)2 þ O2

ðR2Þ

PThe released CLAS oxygen is used for normal combustion of the

fuel in the fuel reactor, through the typical reaction R3:

reactor (AR) is shown at top, while the fuel reactor (FR) is shown at bottom (Reprinted

PThe experimental work on CLOU and CLAS processes were first
published by Lyngfelt and Mattisson in 2009 [122] and by Moghta-
deri in 2010 [124], respectively. Some monometallic oxide systems
were proposed as feasible oxygen carrier materials, including CuO,
Mn2O3, and Co3O4. A thermodynamic analysis was performed show-
ing that CuO and Mn2O3 were most promising because their reduc-
tion is exothermic, which would result in an additional temperature
increase in the fuel reactor. This increase in temperature could be a
significant advantage, as it would promote the oxygen release rate.
Experiments were also performed in a batch fluidized bed reactor
with coal and petroleum coke using Cu-based oxygen carrier par-
ticles. The experiments showed that the overall CLAS reaction rate
under these conditions was governed by the oxygen release reaction
(R2) and the combustion reaction (R3).

PBased on additional thermodynamic analyses of oxygen carriers
for CLOU, Shulman et al. [125] reported that the oxide pairs Cuo-
Cu2O, Mn2O3 ¡ Mn3O4, and Co3O4(cid:1)(cid:1)CoO were potential candidates
for CLAS. Of these, CuO has received the most attention and seems to
be the most promising with respect to the rate of oxygen release, see
for example references [126(cid:1)128]. The monometallic oxides of Cu,
Mn, and Co release oxygen in the fuel reactor through reactions (R5-
R7) below [122]. R8 is the decomposition reaction for a multi-oxide
system of (MnyFe1-y)Ox, which has also shown promise as a CLAS
material, both thermodynamically and experimentally [129].

Pabove 1028 °C, Mn2O3 at temperatures above 899 °C, Co3O4 above
889 °C, and (Mn0.8Fe0.2)2O3 above 960 °C. For the combined oxide
system of (Mn0.8Fe0.2)2O3, there are two parallel curves that con-
verge at higher temperatures, which exist due to the presence of a
two-phase region where both the oxidized and reduced oxides exist
[129].

PIn the air reactor, the oxygen carrier needs to react with air to
reduce the oxygen concentration in the outlet to a reasonable level,
not exceeding 5%; otherwise, heat losses and subsequent process
efficiency would be unacceptable. A CLAS system using oxygen car-
riers of CuO, Mn2O3, Co3O4, and (Mn0.8Fe0.2)2O3 was modeled from
the oxygen partial pressure and temperature relations obtained
from experiments, with maximum temperatures in the air reactor of
955 °C, 820 °C, 850 °C, and 890 °C, respectively [122]. When the par-
ticles are transferred to the fuel reactor, a high temperature is clearly
advantageous to increase the rate of oxygen release.

P2.3.2. Performance of chemical looping materials

PThe CLOU concept was first experimentally demonstrated using a
Cu-based oxygen carrier with both gaseous and solid fuels [122].
There have been a large number of articles published in the last five
years with experimental investigations of different oxygen carrier
materials, mostly based on Cu and Mn oxides.

PBesides the pure CuO and Mn2O3 discussed in previous section,
several mixed oxides of Cu and Mn have the ability to release O2. A
series of different spinel compounds, with the formula CuxMn3-xO4
(x = 3Cu/(Cu + Mn)), can form in the Cu-Mn system that have CLAS
characteristics of oxygen release and reoxidation under appropriate
reaction conditions.

PIn addition to the Cu-Mn system, other mixed oxides of Mn, for
example materials containing oxides of Fe, Ni, Si, and Mg have been
found to possess CLAS characteristics. For example, the Mn-Fe oxide
system mentioned in the previous section has been studied in detail
by Crum et al. [130]. The oxides of Mn and Fe form a solid solution
with the mineral name bixbyite, (FexMn1-x)2O3, in the temperature
range 700(cid:1)950 °C. Depending on the atomic ratio of Mn to (Mn + Fe),
a spinel phase with the general formula (Mn0.8Fe0.2)2O3 is formed at
temperatures higher than 945 °C.

PApart from the iron oxides mentioned above, perovskite-type
oxides (already discussed in some detail in association with ion
transport membranes in Section 2.1.3) with the general formula
ABO3-d, for which A and B are cations with large and small radii and
the degree of oxygen deficiency of the structure is given by d, also
possess CLAS characteristics. In a cubic perovskite structure, alkali,
alkaline-earth, or rare-earth-metal cations A are 12-fold coordinated
with the oxygen anions, whereas the transition-metal cations B are
6-fold coordinated with oxygen. The vacancies in perovskite materi-
als facilitate the migration of oxygen ions during the decomposition
and re-oxidation of the material [131].

PFrom a thermodynamic point of view, CaMnO3-d is currently the
most promising perovskite for CLAS. However, one disadvantage of
CaMnO3-d is its irreversible decomposition at high temperatures.
One possibility to avoid the irreversible decomposition of CaMnO3-d
is by partial substitution of Mn-sites with other transition-metal
oxides. For instance, Leion et al. [132] investigated the CLAS charac-
teristics of CaMn1-xTixO3-d by using both thermogravimetric
analysis and a fluidized(cid:1)bed reactor in the temperature range of
630(cid:1)1000 °C. CaMn1-xTixO3-d was prepared by using spray pyrolysis
followed by freeze granulation. The materials were calcined in the
temperature range 1050(cid:1)1250 °C.

PTable 2 contains an overview of the experimental investigations
of CLAS/CLOU materials performed in laboratory experiments; and
the investigations in a pilot unit (continuous interconnected fluid-
ized bed reactor) are summarized in Table 3. Adanez et al. [133] and
Mattisson [122] provided details of the discussion on CLAS materials
in 2011 and 2013 respectively. From the data in the tables, the tem-
peratures required for CLAS operation almost always exceed 700 °C
and generally range between »850 and 1000 °C.

PAs previously mentioned, copper oxide has received a great deal
of attention as an efficient oxygen carrier for CLAS applications,
owing to its high reactivity and high oxygen transport capacity. Sev-
eral studies have found that CuO with ZrO2 or MgAl2O4 is highly
promising as a CLAS material [127,128,136,137,158]. Although
highly promising with respect to reactivity, Adanez-Rubio et al. also
reported that the particles of CuO and MgAl2O4 increase in porosity
as a function of time and hence lose mechanical strength [136]. In
addition, Arjmand et al. compared the feasibility of using CuO with

PAl2O3 and MgAl2O4 as a support and found that CuO combines read-
ily with Al2O3 to form CuAl2O4, which does not have CLAS properties
[128].

PAlthough the monometallic systems of CuO/Cu2O and Mn2O3/
Mn3O4 clearly showed interesting properties for CLAS applica-
tion, they are not without drawbacks. Copper has a relatively
high cost and low melting temperature, and manganese materi-
als suffer from slow kinetics of reoxidation of Mn2O3/Mn3O4 to
Mn2O3 at low temperatures needed in order to fully oxidize
[122]. Therefore, the combined oxides, such as
the material
the (Mn0.8Fe0.2)2O3/(Mn0.8Fe0.2)3O4
system mentioned above,
have been considered.

PSeveral other combined oxides of recent interest include other
Mn-Fe-O systems. Ryden et al. [154] investigated two bimetallic
oxide carriers, one of which was Mn3O4 mixed with Fe2O3 in a molar
ratio of 2, while the other was a natural manganese ore with a rela-
tively high content of Fe2O3. Both materials had a CLAS effect in the
temperature interval of 850(cid:1)1000 °C and showed excellent proper-
ties for carbon capture after combustion. Unfortunately, both mate-
rials deteriorated and turned to very fine powder after several hours
of combustion. This lack of mechanical stability appears to be a gen-
eral problem with this system, as swelling and increased porosity
were noted also by Shulman et al. [155]

PAnother combined oxide system of interest is Mn-Si-O. Shulman
et al. [155] prepared particles of 80 wt% Mn3O4 with SiO2 by
freeze granulation. The system released oxygen in the gas phase in
the temperature range of 820(cid:1)900 °C, but showed no reaction at
950(cid:1)1100 °C. Jing et al. investigated spray-dried particles of Mn3O4/
SiO2 with varying contents of Mn using a batch fluidized bed reactor
[141]. When the samples contained more than 90% Mn3O4, the par-
ticles showed no uncoupling at 900 °C, while the samples containing
50 and 70 wt% Mn3O4 released oxygen.

PFinally, some research has been conducted on other combined
oxides, such as Mn2O3 with CuO [147], Mn-Ni with Mn-Mg
[125,155], etc. with all these systems showing some interesting
CLAS results. These systems variously demonstrated improved sta-
bility, better mechanical strength, and faster oxidation reaction
kinetics; higher reaction rates with methane that increased with
time on-stream; and potential for CaO enhancement compared to
the single metal carriers studied previously. Additional development
is likely to improve upon these properties.

P2.3.3. CLAS process considerations

PIn addition to material advancements, developments in CLAS pro-
cess configurations were also studied by many researchers. During
the CLAS process, due to the low ash fusion temperature, the

Poperating temperature cannot exceed »1000 °C. At this temperature,
the oxygen concentration of the product stream in the fuel reactor
can only reach »12 vol% with Cu oxides, which is much less than rec-
ommended (25 vol%) for the complete combustion in an oxy-contin-
uous interconnected fluidized bed (cFB) reactor. Shah et al. [159]
developed a novel chemical looping oxy combustor (CLOC) process
which provides an integration of CLAS with a fluidized bed oxy-fuel
combustor, which has the advantage of eliminating the need for an
additional oxygen polishing unit and carbon stripper, as well as min-
imizing the problems related to solids handling and separation. The
energy penalty of the CLOC process was found to be »4(cid:1)5 times
smaller than those of the CAS unit cases, and half of that of the CLOU
process.

PShah et al. [123] proposed an integrated chemical looping air sep-
aration (ICLAS) process, in which a mixture of recycled flue gas
and/or steam is used during the reduction half cycle. This process is
specifically designed for integration into coal- or gas-fired oxy-fuel
power plants, and is expected to offset the energy penalty associated
with CAS units. Zhou et al. [26] further worked on the techno-eco-
nomic assessment of the ICLAS process and came to the conclusion
that the energy requirement for ICLAS would be 75(cid:1)80% lower than
CAS units, but that ICLAS can become feasible only if economic con-
ditions improve.

PAs noted in the Introduction, CLAS processes have largely been
confined to the laboratory and small pilot plant scales. Utility-scale
operations that could operate in a large, 1 GWe coal-fired power
plant are likely decades away. No retrofit options are realistically
possible; new, grassroots designs would surely be required. How-
ever, smaller scale processes have the potential to be more immedi-
ately competitive with PSA/TSA scale separations. Further, as noted
next, the difficulties associated with this scale-up are not insur-
mountable, but will require sustained research and development
efforts to continue.

PThe operational challenges associated with fluidized beds trans-
ferring fairly dense materials between reactors and the safety issues
associated with fuel-air systems operated cyclically between reac-
tors respectively have been addressed through industrial experience,
such as Sasol's with iron based Fischer(cid:1)Tropsch catalysts in circulat-
ing loop reactors, and general petroleum refining industry experi-
ence of operating fluid catalytic cracking reactors for the past
75 years. However, this does not mean that such operation is easy.
The separation and recovery of the oxygen transfer material can
pose significant difficulties, especially if mechanical degradation
and attrition are occurring, as some of the materials discussed in
Section 2.3.2 undergo (e.g., Mn3O4 mixed with Fe2O3).

PBeyond these potential operational challenges, the appeal of
inherent oxygen separation by the very chemical reaction (i.e., com-
bustion) that is desired is strong. Despite the increased mechanical
complexity associated with fluidized bed operation and circulation
of solids, the natural air separation that occurs by splitting the com-
bustion reactions away from the air oxidant are compelling. The
technical challenges that CLAS process development is facing should
find solace in the same rich industrial history mentioned above.
Fluid catalytic cracking reactors and slurry-bubble column reactors
used in Fischer(cid:1)Tropsch synthesis have developed attrition-resis-
tant materials that face more mechanically challenging environ-
ments than the CLAS oxygen carriers require. The unique feature of
the CLAS systems is the high temperatures at which the circulation
occurs.

3. Challenges and opportunities

3.1. Membranes

PThe primary challenge with membranes for oxygen separation is
in the materials area, with focus on the fundamental need to

Pproduce membranes with both sufficient thinness and mechanical
integrity to produce high fluxes and reasonable durability. Polymer
membranes that maintain integrity at higher operating tempera-
tures are needed. Mixed matrix membranes that combine, for exam-
ple, polymers and zeolites, require better contact and adhesion
between the components to avoid pinholes and other non-selective
bypassing. Ion transport membranes generally require high temper-
atures and may suffer from chemical instability.

PAs is true in much of science and technology, the opportunities lie
in the same areas as the challenges. Polymer membranes that are
stable at higher temperatures would extend the operating envelope
and potential for applications within existing combustion units. Sim-
ilarly, new ion transport membranes that can effectively transport
oxygen ions at temperatures that are experienced in the cooler flue
gas sections of combustion plants, e.g., < < 700 °C, would revolution-
ize oxygen separations for combustion processes. Better material
processing techniques and adhesion might make mixed matrix
membranes feasible. The surface modification efforts applied to the
added inorganic phase to make them bond more strongly with the
polymers, while simultaneously avoiding pore plugging, is a definite
opportunity.

PSeveral questions that may guide future research directions
include the following. Can membranes be made that incorporate
structural supports as integral parts of the membrane, instead of
merely coating on a porous substrate? For all, but especially for the
mixed matrix membranes, can materials with the same coefficient
of thermal expansion be engineered? In inverse analogy to the mate-
rials research that has raised the threshold temperature for super-
conductivity, can materials be developed that will allow ion
transport membranes to operate at much lower temperatures,
either through better substituents in the perovskite structures or
completely new materials?

3.2. Adsorption

PThe primary challenges facing adsorption processes are the need
to improve the selectivity of the sorbents used and process intensifi-
cation that would allow construction of economical world scale
plants that could compete with cryogenic distillation. This may be a
daunting challenge because there are likely no simple answers to
these economy of scale issues, but the potential for lower operating
costs and energy savings offered by adsorption are compelling. In
addition, the improvement on oxygen recovery of sorbent materials
may also be a challenge, as low recovery leads to much higher air
excess required and would result in higher energy consumption.
Other challenges are efficient control and operation of more complex
systems. As noted previously, these systems are generally highly
automated and straightforward to operate, but the three and four
bed processes introduce additional complexity.

PThe opportunities associated with PSA and TSA cycles are more
process related. However, sorbent selection is a complex problem
because it depends not only on the adsorption cycle, but also the
form of sorbent that are to be used. In order to bring better purity,
recovery and productivity, the attributes of a sorbent such as capac-
ity, selectivity, regenerability, kinetics, and cost are still listed as
highest priority. These would be the enabling feature or the critical
hurdle to overcome to make the economic step-change that is
required. Small and intermediate scale operations are proven, but
the scale-up to large plants has yet proven to be economically viable.
Unfortunately, the field of adsorption and sorbents is fairly mature,
which means that the required transformative technology is not
likely to be found in the zeolite and carbon based materials currently
in use. Material advances in new areas are probably required.

PThis discussion on materials leads into the first scientific question
that can direct future research in the area. Can materials beyond zeo-
lites and carbon molecular sieves be developed with higher capacity

Pand selectivity? Along the promising lines of the silver-substituted
zeolites, are there other ion exchange possibilities or hybrid materi-
als, similar to the mixed matrix membranes, that could enhance
adsorption selectivity and/or capacity? What are the most viable
strategies to overcome the economy of scale hurdles associated with
adding multiple parallel trains and instead increase adsorbent bed
sizes in single train operations?

Putilization. Although CLAS is under rapid development in recent
years, it largely remains at lab stage with large-scale application yet
to be tested. Further research on new chemical and physical mem-
branes, sorbents and chemical-looping material is essential in the
field of ASU, not to mention more efficient and cost-effective techni-
ques for the scale-up of novel technologies to larger industrial appli-
cations.

3.3. Chemical looping

Acknowledgments

PAs introduced in Section 2.3.3 on CLAS process considerations, a
number of the challenges and opportunities for chemical looping
operations to facilitate oxy-fuel combustion already have been iden-
tified. However, materials remain the primary challenges with CLAS
systems. Mechanical stability and oxygen transfer rates are key char-
acteristics for successful systems. Oxygen carriers that are active at
lower temperatures would be desirable, but are less likely to be
developed due to thermodynamic constraints on the solid systems.
The process economics will likely hinge on the cost and lifetime of
the oxygen carrier.

PAs with ion transport membranes, material development appears
to be an area ripe with opportunity. Although the perovskite materi-
als have shown promise and there are a number of research follow-
ing different strategies to improve chemical and mechanical stability
of CLAS materials, less research has been performed in the area of
additives and dopants for the CLAS solids compared to the ion
exchange membranes. There appear to be areas of potential overlap
between these research efforts. On one hand, similar to the improve-
ments demonstrated in the ion transport membranes, chemical per-
formance will certainly be enhanced as more additives and dopants
are explored, and experimental studies will thus be benefitted by
being augmented, directed, and reinforced by the available theoreti-
cal calculations such as density functional theory predictions. On the
other hand, theoretical tools may be less meaningful when consider-
ing mechanical stabilities, as mechanical strength is often affected
by the overall performance of the particles. Particles with high
mechanical strength have been developed by optimizing preparation
and calcining conditions. In addition, the high mechanical strength
must be maintained during multiple redox cycles, which is the main
problem to be overcome.

PA few of the many potential scientific questions to guide future
CLAS research include the following. Beyond mechanical and chemi-
cal stability and high oxygen transfer capacity and rates, what are
the characteristics of the ideal CLAS oxygen carrier? How close are
the present materials to achieving these ideals? Although the initial
studies of support materials has not been overwhelmingly positive,
are there other options yet to be explored (e.g., ceria has received
some attention due to its oxygen reservoir ability, but it is relatively
expensive; are there other supports that can enhance the oxygen
carriers)?

4. Conclusion

PThe preceding discussion provides a review of three major tech-
nologies as alternatives to cryogenic air separation for the produc-
tion of oxygen. Based on this review, membrane methods are simple
and economical compared to cryogenic methods. However reliable
membranes are still hard to find and ITMs must be operated at rela-
tively high temperatures. Adsorption air separation methods are
also very promising, yet currently suited only for small and
medium-sized markets. Decreased purity due to larger gas flow rates
and other factors still impede PSA and TSA technologies from large-
scale application. Oxygen generated by the CLAS air separation
method could result in significant advantages with respect to fuel
conversion rates compared to chemical-looping combustion, which
make this technique highly promising in oxy-fuel combustion
