Contents

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in our daily lives. Both light and heat are generated from
LED chips and then transmitted or conducted through multiple packaging materials and interfaces. Part
of the transmitted light converts into heat along the light propagation; in return, the accumulation of
heat leads to the degradation of light output. The accumulated heat negatively influences the reliability
and longevity of LEDs, and thus thermal management is critical for LED packaging and applications. On
the other hand, in LED packaging processes, many fluid flow problems exist, such as phosphor coating,
silicone injection, chip bonding, solder reflow, etc. Among them, phosphor coating is the most impor-
tant process which is essential for LED performance. Phosphor gel is a kind of non-Newton fluid and its
coating process is a typical fluid-flow problem. Overall, since LED packaging and applications present
many heat and fluid flow problems, obtaining a full understanding of these problems enables advance-
ments in the development of LED processes and designs. In this review, the emphasis is placed on heat
generation in chips, heat flow in packages and application products, fluid flow in phosphor coating process,
etc. This is a domain in which significant progress has been achieved in the last decade, and reporting
on these advances will facilitate state-of-the-art LED packaging and application technologies.

1. Introduction

Light-emitting diode (LED), as a type of solid-state lighting (SSL),
is a lighting technology that arguably constitutes the greatest ad-
vancement in the lighting industry in the previous century [1–3].
In an LED, electricity is converted into light. It is well recognized
that LEDs offer the following advantages. (1) Energy savings: LED
requires less energy to emit equivalent light compared to other light
sources. (2) Long lifetime: Due to their compact physical charac-
teristics, LEDs are also more long-lasting than other lamps.
Incandescent bulbs tend to last 1000 hours as heat destroys the fil-
ament, and fluorescent lamps tend to last 10,000 hours. While LEDs
can last over 50,000 hours or more in theory. (3) Environment-
friendly characteristics: Unlike fluorescent lamps, there is no mercury
in LEDs, which is environment-friendly whenever the LEDs are dis-
carded. (4) Wide color temperatures: LEDs provide a wider range
of color temperature (4500 K–12,000 K) and a wider operation tem-
perature (−20 °C to 85 °C). (5) Quick startup: LEDs do not have low-
temperature startup problems, which is different from many other
lighting sources, such as metal halogen lamps. Based on the above
advantages, so far, LEDs have been considered as the fourth gen-
eration of light sources [1,4]. They have been extensively applied

in our daily lives, including street lamps, backlighting, automobile
headlamps, and general lighting. It is believed that LEDs will benefit
the whole world even more extensively and profoundly in the future
[5,6]. Due to LEDs’ contribution to the whole of human society, the
2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three scientists for the
invention of efficient blue LEDs based on gallium nitride (GaN) [7].

1.1. Basic knowledge of LED

For high-power LED chips, the key part is the “PN junction” where
a quantum well or multiple quantum well (MQW) layers are sand-
wiched with a p-GaN layer and an n-GaN layer [1]. In a PN junction,
the “P” material contains an excess of positive charges (also called
holes) due to the absence of electrons. The “N” material contains
an excess of negative charges due to the presence of electrons. To
understand the lighting principle, we can consider an unbiased PN
junction. Fig. 1 shows the PN energy band diagram. The depletion
region extends mainly into the p-side. There is a potential barrier
from Ec on the n-side to the Ec on the p-side, which is called the
built-in voltage, V0. This potential barrier prevents the excess free
electrons on the n-side from diffusing into the p-side. When a voltage
V is applied to the junction, the built-in potential is reduced from

Fig. 1. LED lighitng principle. (a) The energy band diagram of a PN junction without any bias. Built-in potential V0 prevents electrons from diffusing from the n-side to the
p-side. (b) The applied bias reduces V0 and thereby allows electrons to diffuse or be injected into the p-side, resulting in light emission when electrons and holes recombine.

V0 to V0–V. This allows electrons from the n-side to get injected into
the p-side and recombine with the holes there, resulting in spon-
taneous emission of photons (light).

To make the PN junction applicable to LEDs, different types of
LED chips have been proposed. Fig. 2 presents three kinds of LED
chip designs, which include the conventional chip, the vertical chip,
and the flip chip. The conventional chip generally utilizes sap-
phire as the substrate for epitaxial growth. p- and n-electrodes are
arranged at the two edges of the top surface of the chip. However,
the thermal conductivity of the sapphire substrate (~20−40 W/
(m·K)) is low compared to that of silicon (~150 W/(m·K)); so, it
establishes a barrier for the chip heat dissipation. To improve this
shortcoming of conventional chips, vertical injection chip and flip
chip designs have been proposed [8]. Unlike the conventional chip,
the electrodes in the vertical injection chip are arranged at the top
and bottom of the chip. Such an electrode structure can improve
the uniformity of current density distribution, resulting in MQW
utilization efficiency enhancement and lighting emitting efficien-
cy (LEE) improvement. Compared to conventional LEDs, the flip-
chip LED is “flipped-over” or inverted [9]. The electrodes are arranged
at the bottom of the chip, and light is emitted from the top surface.
As a result, such structure avoids light absorption by the metal
contact in conventional chips, and the utilization efficiency of the
MQW is enhanced. Moreover, in the flip chip, the sapphire is ar-
ranged as the top layer, which can, to a certain extent, solve the poor
heat dissipation problem of conventional chips. Heat generated in
the flip chip LED can be dissipated to the packaging board through
the highly thermally conductive contact electrodes rather than sap-
phire. Thus, flip chips possess better thermal characteristics.

Blue LED chips cannot be directly used in application products,
and it is necessary that they are packaged and emit white light. Cur-
rently, the most common packaging method of producing white light
is shown in Fig. 3. Under the blue light emission, yellow phos-
phors (such as cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet, YAG:Ce3+)
could emit yellow light, and the mixture of transmitted blue and
yellow lights generate white light. By controlling the energy ratio
of blue light and yellow light, the white light can be obtained at
different color temperatures. This method is easy and simple to
handle with high luminous efficiency. Thus, it has been widely
adopted in industry.

1.2. LED packaging process and its application

Fig. 4 shows the LED industry chain. It consists of three catego-
ries: the upstream, the midstream, and the downstream. Epitaxy
growth is the first step in the upstream, in which the emitting layer,
cladding layer, buffer layer, reflector, etc., are accomplished in this
process. The metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is
the main method to produce blue, green, and ultraviolet epitaxy ma-
terials, such as GaN or GaAs. Different colors of LEDs can be made
by employing different types of epiwafer. After the fabrication of
LED wafers in the MOCVD chamber, the chip manufacturers will dice

the wafer into LED chips with positive and negative electrodes. The
chip manufacturing process includes film plating, lithography, chem-
ical or iron etching, scribing, etc. In Fig. 4, the midstream industry
is referred to as packaging. Through the upstream, we can obtain
blue light LED chips. Before the application, we should convert the
blue light emitted from the blue light LED chips into white light LEDs
by packaging. The typical way to convert blue light into white light
is shown in Fig. 3. Currently, there are many types of LED pack-
ages. According to the number of LED chips, it can be categorized
as single-chip package, multiple-chip package, or chip-on-board
(COB) package. The downstream industry refers to the integration
of LED modules into lighting luminaries and systems aimed at dif-
ferent applications, such as street lamps, backlighting units, general
lighting, etc.

From the industry chain of high power LEDs, it is seen that pack-
aging constitutes an essential step from LED chip to applications.
Packaging not only can ensure better performance of LED devices
by enhancing reliability and optical characteristics, but can also
realize control and adjustment of the final optical performance. A
typical lead-frame LED package and the function of each part are
shown in Fig. 5. In this LED packaging, the LED chip is used to emit
blue light, but it will generate heat as well. The solder is used to
bond the chip onto the copper slug. The copper heat slug is used
to dissipate the heat. The lead-frame and boding wire are utilized
for electrical interconnection. The optical lens and phosphors are
used to control the lighting performance and light conversion. The

moulding compound is employed to maintain the lead-frame and
copper heat slug, and to fasten the optical lens.

To reach the above functions, the standard LED packaging process
is formed in industry, and is shown in Table 1. Step by step, the pack-
aging processes are as follows.

(a) Chip bonding: The chip is bonded onto the substrate by solder.
The solder is a kind of non-Newton fluid cured in the reflow
process. It is a complex problem coupled with fluid flowing,
fluid curing, and heat dissipation. The solder will cure while
flowing in the reflow process, and temperatures influence the
flowing characteristics greatly.

(b) Wire bonding: The electrodes of the chip are connected to
the lead frame by the bonding wires. The bonding wires can
be gold, copper, aluminum, etc.

(c) Phosphor coating: Phosphor silicone matrix of a certain con-
centration is dispersed onto the chip surface to form a
phosphor layer. The purpose of coating the phosphor layer
onto the blue LED chip is to convert part of blue light into
yellow light, resulting in white light after color mixing. Phos-
phor coating is a typical fluid flowing problem, and the final
phosphor layer’s morphology is dependent on the flowing
characteristics, and determines the final optical perfor-
mance of LEDs. In addition, phosphor particle sedimentation
may occur in the silicone due to the larger density of phos-
phors, which plays a negative role in the final optical
performance. Therefore, phosphor particle distribution also
needs to be well-controlled during coating. Phosphor coating
constitutes an important and difficult problem. Understand-
ing the flowing and thermal properties can greatly help to

control the flow and reveal potential new processes for phos-
phor coating.

(d) Lens laying: The lens is embedded into the molding com-
pound by the mechanical structure. The lenses, as the
dominant optics, are the key components to realize differ-
ent optical requirements of applications. Conventional lenses
are hemispherical, but their optical performances are poor.
Freeform lenses possess better optical performance, and can
be designed to suit various illumination requirements.
(e) Encapsulation: The silicone is filled into the interspace
between the lens and the molding compound to protect the
chip and bonding wires. This step is a total fluid flowing
problem since the silicone curing at room temperature could
be omitted. The injection pressure and nozzle size are the key
parameters that should be well-controlled.

Through the above packaging steps, white LED modules can be
obtained. However, the typical power for a single module is about
1 W, which is not bright enough for lighting. Therefore, we usually
assembly many modules into LED lamps, whose power ranges from
several watts (e.g., light bulbs) to hundreds or thousands of watts
(e.g., street lamps, search lights, etc.). For such lighting fixtures, the
heat generated in tiny chips will conduct to the ambient through
multiple materials and interfaces. Thus, there are many thermal re-
sistances that influence this heat transfer process, such as interfacial
thermal resistance, thermal spreading resistance, and component-
to-ambient thermal resistance.

1.3. Existing heat and fluid flow problems

Table 1 shows the LED packaging processes step by step. It can
be seen that there are many heat and fluid flow problems in LED
packaging and applications. Among them, three typical problems,
i.e. heat generation, phosphor flow, and heat dissipation, as shown
in Fig. 6, are mainly discussed in this review due to the space limi-
tations. The three problems are introduced in detail as below.

Firstly, LED chips are considered to be the primary heat source
in LED packages. The mechanism of heat generation in LED chips
is the non-radiative recombination process, which is dependent on
the materials of MQWs. The current power conversion efficiency
for blue LED chips is about 55%, and thus 45% of the input electri-
cal energy is directly converted to heat [10]. As previously stated
and shown in Fig. 3, along the light propagation, part of the light

Fig. 7. Flowing process of phosphor gel on LED package.

converts into heat, and thus currently ~70% of the input electrical
energy converts to heat in LED products.

Secondly, phosphor-embedded silicone matrix or phosphor gel,
as can be seen from Fig. 3 and Table 1, is the key component that
converts part of the blue light into yellow light, so as to finally gen-
erate white light. The phosphor gel is a kind of non-Newton fluid,
which may cure after a period of time, and the curing time can be
shortened when heated [11–13]. Fig. 7 shows the phosphor gel
flowing process, which includes four steps: contacting, wetting,
spreading, and stabilizing. It can be seen that after dispensing a drop
of phosphor gel onto the LED chip, the phosphor gel contacts the
chip first, then wets to cover the chip, then spreads along the heat
slug, and finally stabilizes to form a convex shape. Meanwhile, in
the flow process, the phosphor particles may settle due to the gravity
effect, which would cause non-uniform particle distribution in the
gel. It has been demonstrated that phosphor gel morphology and
particle distribution play important roles in determining the final
optical characteristics of white LED packages [14–18]. Improper phos-
phor gel morphology and particle distribution may cause poor color
characteristics, i.e., blue rings or yellow rings, at the edge of the light-
ing pattern, as shown in Fig. 8. The flowing property of the phosphor
gel should be well considered in the phosphor coating process in
LED packaging. In addition, not only the heat generated in LED chips
will be conducted to phosphors, but also the phosphors will gen-
erate heat during the photoluminescent process. The curing process
of the matrix and silicone will occur simultaneously with the flowing
process. High temperature will accelerate the curing process since
silicone’s viscosity increases greatly at high temperature. There-
fore, the heat and fluid flow problems should be considered
simultaneously in the phosphor coating process.

Thirdly, to prolong the reliability and lifetime of LEDs, we need
to attempt to dissipate the heat generated inside of the package to

phosphor flow, and heat dissipation.

coating.

the ambient and decrease the working temperature as much as pos-
sible because high temperature greatly deteriorates LEDs’
performance. This is a systematic problem since it refers to heat gen-
eration, heat conduction and spreading, interface heat flow, and
convection to the ambient.

It should be noted that the heat dissipation and fluid flow are
usually coupled with each other and should be considered
simultaneously.

1.4. Review arrangement

In this review, we began with an introduction of heat genera-
tion in LED chips, followed by a detailed review of phosphor coating
process. Different phosphor coating processes were compared with
a presentation of corresponding advantages and disadvantages. We
then focused on the thermal management of LEDs, from chip to
package, and from package to application. Thermal resistance con-
stituted the parameter to evaluate the heat dissipation ability, and
thus interfacial resistance, spreading resistance, and component-
to-ambient resistance were introduced systematically. Finally, state-
of-the-art thermal management solutions for LEDs were presented.

2. Heat generation of LED chips

LED chips are the core and functional part that produce light.
Accompanying light emitting, heat will be generated within LED
chips due to different kinds of nonradiative recombinations and other
causes of photon annihilation. In this section, emphasis will be placed
on analyzing the nonradiative recombination in the active region
of LED chips and the factors that prohibit photon emission and lead
to heat generation. Efficient LED chip designs from the perspec-
tive of epitaxial growth are reviewed with the purpose of suppressing
the nonradiative recombination. In the active region of LED chips,
Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination and Auger recombina-
tion are explained, whereas current crowding and electron overflow
outside of the active region are also included in this section. Widely
reported techniques to improve the light extraction efficiency of LED
chips, such as roughing, photonic crystal integration, surface
plasmonics, etc., will be covered. In the last part of this section, new
LED chip designs are listed based on nanowire epitaxial growth tech-
niques, which show great potential advantages over existing planar
multiple quantum well (MQW) designs.

2.1. Heat generation due to nonradiative recombination

Fig. 9 shows the schematic of the band gap of semiconductor ma-
terial, which has an electronic band structure determined by the
crystal properties of the material. The discrete energy distribution
is affected by the absolute temperature. Above absolute zero tem-
perature, the existing energy levels are filled with electrons according
to the Boltzmann distribution. The free electrons range from their
bounds to a freely moving state which is called a conduction band
(CB). The valance band (VB) is the highest range of electron ener-
gies in which electrons are bounded. The difference between CB and
VB is called band gap or forbidden band, since ideally there is no
electron energy state within this region [19].

The freely moving electrons in the meta-stable state exist in the
CB until they fall to the VB and recombine with an electron hole.
This process is referred to as recombination. There are two types
of recombination within the active region of LED chips, i.e., radia-
tive recombination and nonradiative recombination. For radiative
recombination, the electron fills a hole in the valance band by re-
leasing a photon with energy equal to the band gap energy of the
semiconductor material [20]. This process is the foundation of the
LED working mechanism. For nonradiative recombination, the re-
leasing energy exists in the form of atom vibrations within the

Fig. 9. Schematic of the band gap of a semiconductor material.

crystal, such as phonons; if the energy is not collected, it dissi-
pates as heat. Apparently, the nonradiative recombination should
be minimized for high device performance and low heat genera-
tion [21]. In the active layer of LED chips, there are two major
nonradiative recombination processes, i.e., defect-related SRH re-
combination and Auger recombination, which will be described in
detail below.

2.1.1. Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination

Fig. 10 shows the band diagram which illustrates the recombi-
nation process. In Fig. 10, the SRH recombination is used to describe
the recombination of the electron and hole at the undesired energy
level, which is created within the band gap by defects in the lattice.
They were first investigated by Shockley, Read, and Hall in 1952 and
were used as a model to study the nonradiative recombination
caused by defects [22].

Defects in the crystal structure are the main cause of SRH
nonradiative recombination. These defects include unwanted foreign
atoms, crystallographic defects, etc. All of the defects have energy
level bands that are different from the major semiconductor atoms.
Therefore, the one or more new energy levels can be generated
within the forbidden band gap. Unfortunately, these energy levels
within the gap of the semiconductor are efficient recombination
centers, especially when the deep level is near the middle of the
gap. Detailed analytical expressions are obtained for the lifetime es-
timation of the SRH recombination [21]. These expressions reveal
that when the trap level is at or close to the mid-gap energy, the
lifetime is twice the minority lifetime, and the probability of SRH
recombination is increased. Moreover, the increase of tempera-
ture will raise the nonradiative recombination probability. For
simplicity, the recombination rate can be estimated by RSRH = An,
where A is the SRH recombination coefficient and n is the carrier
concentration [23].

2.1.2. Auger recombination

Auger recombination describes the process in which the elec-
tron in CB gives off excess energy and recombines with a hole in
VB. During this process, the excess energy is obtained by a second
electron or hole instead of emitting the energy as a photon. The
newly excited electrons or holes release their energy through col-
lision with the crystal lattice and return back to the band edges.

The probability of Auger recombination increases with the con-
centration of charge carriers since this process is based on the ability
of the charge carriers to exchange energy. The rate of Auger recom-
bination can be expressed as RAuger = Cn3, where C is Auger

Polytechnic Institute, US).

recombination coefficient and n represents the carrier concentra-
tion. The coefficient C on the scale of 10−28–10−29 cm6/s for III–V
semiconductors plays an important role [24]. Normally, C de-
creases with the increased energy band gap. According to the
reported Auger recombination coefficients in Table 2, the simula-
tion work adopts 10−30 cm6/s for GaN-based LED chip design, which
exhibits good prediction of device performance [29]. More de-
tailed discussions about the Auger recombination coefficients can
be found in a report by Cho et al. [30] At low carrier concentra-
tions, the Auger recombination is neglected for practical reasons.
However, at very high excitation intensity or the carrier injection
current situation, n is much higher and Auger recombination should
be considered.

the injected carriers are away from the surface. This can be real-
ized by carrier injection under one contact which is smaller than
the LED chip.

2.2. Heat generation due to current crowding and overflow

In Section 2.1, heat generation within the active region of LED
chips due to the nonradiative recombination was introduced. Here,
the focus will be placed on heat generated outside of the LED active
region. Particularly, heat generation due to current crowding and
overflow will be considered. The solutions are largely attributed to
efficient LED chip design at the epitaxial and device level.

2.1.3. Surface recombination

2.2.1. Current crowding in LED chips

Nonradiative recombination also occurs at the semiconductor
surface. At surfaces, the periodicity of the crystal lattice ends. There-
fore, the band diagram will change at the surface since the strict
periodicity of the crystal arrangement is perturbed. Additional elec-
tronic states will appear within the forbidden gap of the material
[31]. Fortunately, surface recombination can be greatly reduced if

In the realm of semiconductor physics, current crowding is used
to describe a nonhomogeneous distribution of current density
through the semiconductor at the vicinity of the contacts and over
the PN junctions. As shown in Fig. 11(a), in conventional LED chips,
the GaN layer grows on insulating substrates (e.g., sapphire) where
electrons laterally spread from n-pad to p-pad. Due to this geom-
etry, the finite resistance of the Ohmic contact and the confinement
layer causes the current to “crowd” near the edge of the contact.
As shown in Fig. 11(b), the current density distribution can be un-
desirably non-uniform. The current density could drop from 99 A/
cm2 at n-pad to 11 A/cm2 at p-pad [32].

Due to the non-linear distribution of the current density, the
crowding phenomenon becomes more severe in high power LEDs
operating at large current density. The remarkable current concen-
tration at the edges of p-type and n-type electrodes has a detrimental
effect on device performance. On the one hand, the local increase

of carrier density leads to a high recombination rate, causing non-
uniformity of light emission in the active region. This will induce
localized overheating of the heterostructure at certain points and
the formation of hot spots, whereas a large portion of the device
remains inactive during operation. On the other hand, the inho-
mogeneous distribution of current will increase the electromigration
effect, and voids are formed. Overall, current crowding will induce
the local overheating of the heterostructure, lower the device per-
formance, and increase the series resistance.

Various solutions have been proposed to reduce the current
crowding problem, such as multi-fingered chip design [33]. Through
simulations, Joshi et al. report that the current crowding problem
is finally eliminated by a combination of multi-finger with delta-
doping design. Vertical chip configuration can also solve this problem.

2.2.2. Current overflow in LED chips

Current overflow, also referred to as electron leakage, de-
scribes the process in which the energetic electrons move from
n-type through the active region and recombine with holes in the
p-type GaN without being confined in the active region. Since only
the carriers confined in the active region are able to participate in
the radiative recombination, the recombination caused by elec-
tron overflow generates unwanted heat. The current overflow is
mainly caused by the higher carrier mobility of the electrons [34]
(about 200 cm2 V−1 s−1) than that of the holes (about 10 cm2 V−1 s−1)
[35]. The longer current spreading length caused by the higher mo-
bility leads to fewer holes than electrons being injected into the
active region. This is the reason why the AlGaN electron blocking
layer (EBL) is usually adopted on the p-side of the active region.

Several theories have been offered to elucidate the reasons for,
and eliminate, the effect of current overflow. The three most well-
known are reviewed below. The first explanation concerns the poor
hole-injection efficiency. Due to the large effective hole mass, low
hole mobility limits the transportation length. In addition, with the
purpose of effectively confining electrons, the Al content is raised.
However, the high mole fraction of Al also prohibits hole injection
[36–38]. Another explanation is that an ineffective EBL should be
the cause of the electrons not being blocked. As we pursue high ef-
ficiency, large carrier concentration is injected into the LED chip.
The increase of concentration and mobility makes it easier for elec-
tron transport. Even though a wide band gap design combined with
an optimal 15% Al mole fraction in the EBL is adopted, this may not
be sufficient for blocking the electrons. A further increase of Al frac-
tion, in addition to the above mentioned reason, will also cause a
polarization mismatch between AlGaN and GaN for the most widely
researched and industrially accepted LED chip design grown in the
c-direction [39,40]. One alternative explanation is that the active
region in the form of MQW and EBL design are not able to fully
confine the electrons. Those escaped electrons will enter the p-type
region, non-radioactively recombine with holes, and generate heat.
The probability of capturing electrons as a function of QW width
was studied [41]. It was proven that increasing the QW thickness
will raise the carrier dwell time, and therefore reduce current over-
flow [42]. Reports on modification of MQW and EBL have also been
presented [43–47]. Moreover, there are some successful reports that
explored LED growth on m-, a-, and other non-polar planes [48–50],
which show lower polarization mismatch than c-plane LEDs.

difference of GaN (n = 2.5)/air (n = 1) interface. Total internal re-
flection (TIR) occurs when the incident angle exceeds the critical
value θc = asin(n1/n2), which can be calculated based on Snell’s law.
The TIR leads to a narrow escape cone of only 23.5°, with an escape
probability of only 4% from the top surface of the LED [51].

Techniques have been developed to improve light extraction ef-
ficiency (LEE), including photonic crystal, periodic surface texturing,
surface roughing, patterned sapphire substrate, and reflectors using
Al or Au electrodes. In this section, we will review the LEE improve-
ment techniques separately at different locations of the LED chip.
Thin-film flip-chip (TFFC) design is widely used in current com-
mercial LEDs, which possess high LEE as compared to that of
conventional LED package design. Thin film LEDs could be real-
ized by removing the sapphire substrate by the laser lift-off
technique. On the other hand, flip-chip LEDs are achieved by sub-
mounting the p-GaN on a high reflectance-metallic mirror to form
the vertical LED configuration. This allows photons to emit from the
thicker n-GaN layer side, and enables a more flexible surface tex-
turing and patterning process on n­GaN to enhance LEE without the
potential effect on the InGaN QWs active region. The TFFC LEDs
combine these two techniques, and therefore show great poten-
tial to enhance LEE.

2.3.1. Light emitting surface texturing and roughening

With the purpose of randomizing the light reflected at the
semiconductor/air or GaN/substrate, surface texturing and rough-
ening are widely-used methods. On the one hand, the straight
propagation paths are disturbed, which enable multiple incidents
on the interface to escape outside of the LED chip [52–54]. On the
other hand, the spherical micro lens array can form a dome-shape
at the interface to lead to more efficient LEE. Successful designs have
been reported by researchers to improve LED output efficiency
[51,53,55]. In addition, the direction of the emission light is un-
confined, resulting in a Lambertian radiation pattern.

To increase the photon escape cone, a SiO2/polystyrene micro lens
array was deposited on the emission surface of the LEDs to form
closed-packed lens arrays, as shown in Fig. 12 [51]. By adding the
refractive index gradient, these arrays allow photons emanating from
the QW to be scattered out of the LED structure with a larger photon
escape cone from 23.5° to 39.8°. Using the SiO2/PS micro lens arrays,
the LEE of the LEDs can be increased with a larger photon escape
cone, and Fresnel reflection loss can be reduced.

An efficient and cost-effective way to study surface texture in
terms of LEE is through simulation. Zhao et al. studied the LEE of
the four TFFC LEDs with different surface texturing by the three-
dimensional finite difference time domain (3D-FDTD) method [53].
Fig. 13 shows the four simulation cases, i.e., flat top surface and top
surfaces with SiO2, SiO2/polystyrene, and GaN micro lens array. They
concluded that by adopting an optimal GaN micro lens diameter
of 1 μm and p-GaN thickness of 195 nm, the LEE could be im-
proved by 2.6 times.

Tsai et al. etched the light emitting layer of a vertical LED chip,
and the corresponding textured structure is shown in Fig. 14(e). The
etching process is shown in Fig. 14(a)–(d). As expected, the results
shown in Fig. 14(f) indicate that the light output power of the top
surface textured LEDs is much higher than conventional LEDs, which
demonstrates that the top surface textures can improve LEE [55].

2.3. Heat generation due to light confinement

2.3.2. Photonic crystal to direct the light emitting shape

Photons generated by radiative recombination may not be able
to escape from the LED chip if they are totally internally reflected
at the semiconductor–air interface. If the incident angle of the light
ray is close to normal, they are effectively extracted outside of the
LED chip; otherwise, they will be trapped inside [21] and con-
verted into heat. This occurs because of the large refractive index

Photonic crystal is added on the top layer of conventional chip
p-GaN. The dielectric constant of the crystal distributes periodi-
cally with special microstructures. Electromagnetic waves
propagating inside will be modulated to form a photonic band gap.
Then, the photon propagation is prohibited if its frequency falls
within the range of the forbidden band. One solution is to use
photonic crystals to gather the non-directional light emitted from

10

the active layer to contact the semiconductor; another solution is
to use the air interface in an angle less than the critical angle of total
reflection to avoid the absorption in the active layer. As shown in
Fig. 15, Lai et al. [56] applied a two-dimensional (2D) photonic quasi-
crystal (PQC) structure to the p-GaN surface of an LED by nano-
imprint lithography and roughened the side of the n-GaN surface.
The result shows that the efficiency of the LED with PQC is sub-
stantially improved compared to the conventional LED.

2.3.3. Patterned sapphire substrate (PSS)

When light emits from the active layer, a very large part will prop-
agate backward directly to the sapphire substrate. Thus, to increase
the escaping opportunity from the LED chip, patterned sapphire sub-
strate offers a promising solution since it can break the TIR and
increase the LEE [57]. Zhang et al. [58] fabricated three types of
nanopatterned sapphire substrates (NPSS) by keeping the same
heights at 200 nm and varying the pattern spacing from 0 nm to
120 nm. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of these
structures are shown in Fig. 16(a)–(f). Here, FSS means flat sap-
phire substrate. The performance of the three types of patterned
substrate LEDs was measured and compared to flat sapphire sub-
strate LED. As shown in Fig. 16, it is clear that LEDs with a patterned
substrate exhibit a large enhancement, and that the denser the pat-
terns are packaged, the higher is the LEE of the LED.

2.3.4. Adding a reflector in flip chip LEDs

Metal reflectors can also be used to enhance LEE, and the dis-
tance between the active region and the metal reflector has a vital
influence on the amplification of LEE. When the Ohmic contact layer
is changed to metal, such as Ag or Au, most of the backward light
will be reflected. However, although a large portion of light will be
reflected, a part of the light is still absorbed by the metal or escapes

tive index material between the semiconductor/air interfaces; (b) schematic of LEDs

through the layer. The escaped amount of light will increase if the
top surface of the metal is rough. Therefore, researchers focus on
novel structures at the top surface of the metal layer to return the
back light. Jan et al. [59] put forward a new structure at the inter-
face between the metal layer and the semiconductor. Specifically,
they added an n-shaping layer, as shown in Fig. 17(a), which can
enhance the total reflectance of these layers at the bottom of the
device. As a result, the LEE increased up to 50% compared to the
previously reported values. The specific total output light flux is
shown in Fig. 17(b).

2.4. Future trends of LED chip design with low heat generation

Based on the above analysis and an understanding of heat gen-
eration within LED chips, efforts have been made to increase the
probability of radiative recombination, and thus reduce heat gen-
eration within the active region. From an epitaxial perspective, LED
chips evolve from p–n junction to double heterojunction and MQW

design. The carriers are well confined within the active region, and
the recombination probability is greatly improved. Better epitaxy
design, such as an optimal electron blocking layer, will soften the
current overflow issues. At the chip level, the sapphire substrates
with high thermal resistance in conventional LED chip design are
replaced by the vertical or flip chip design. This trend not only im-
proves thermal conductivity, but also overcomes the current
crowding problem. Moreover, a large portion of light will be ex-
tracted from the LED chip to reduce the photon annihilation which
generates heat. On the light emitting surface of LEDs, surface tex-
turing and roughening, as well as photonic crystals, are adopted to
improve light output efficiency. Patterned sapphire substrate and
reflector at the metal contact are also proven to constitute effec-
tive candidates to increase LEE.

In the future, it can be reasonably assumed that researchers and
industry will continue to pursue high efficiency, brightness, and low
cost GaN-based solid state lighting technology. In addition to adopt-
ing the above methods to reduce heat generation, obtaining usage

of a large area, low cost Si substrates, non-polar GaN, and improve-
ments of chip design are needed [60]. The GaN nanowire based LED
offers advantages over its planar counterpart in the following ways.
Due to the large aspect-ratio, the dislocation density within the GaN
nanowire could be greatly reduced [61]. The small diameter of the
nanowire also relieves the strain caused by the lattice and thermal
expansion mismatch, which presents a problematic challenge when
planar GaN is grown on a large area or on substrates with large dif-
ferences of thermal expansion coefficient. Moreover, the active region
is enclosed within the core/shell nanowire, and surface recombi-
nation is reduced. Due to the non-planar structure, LEE can be greatly
improved. Furthermore, researchers have reported that multicolor
LEDs can be realized on a single chip through controlling over the
nanocolumn diameter from 137 to 270 nm [62].

3. Phosphor coating and fluid flow

In Section 1.3, we stated that phosphor coating is the most im-
portant fluid flow problem in LED packaging since the coating
process determines the phosphor thickness, location, distribution,
and morphology in LED packaging. For this coating fluid, phos-
phor particles are dispersed in silicone matrix, and the mixture, or
phosphor gel, is a kind of non-Newton fluids. It has been vali-
dated that phosphor concentration, thickness, particle distribution
and morphology influence the optical performance of LEDs greatly.

Phosphor location constitutes the primary consideration in LED pack-
aging. When altering the phosphor layer from being close to being
remote to the chip, the propagation path and energy of the light
will be affected in terms of the scattering and absorption of the phos-
phor, the reflection of the reflector, the absorption of the chip, the
refraction of the lens, etc. Therefore, changing the phosphor loca-
tion will affect the LEE and CCT of LEDs. Phosphor thickness and
concentration are the second consideration in LEDs because the lu-
minous flux and color of LEDs are adjusted mainly through changing
the thickness and concentration. Thickness and concentration can
be varied in manufacturing and will therefore affect the optical con-
sistency of LEDs. Moreover, the dispensed phosphor gel on LED chip
may have different shapes, such as planar, hemispherical, spheri-
cal cap, etc. The phosphor particles scatter the light, and thus the
light propagation in different shapes of phosphor gel may be com-
pletely different. Therefore, phosphor morphology or shape also
requires specific consideration.

3.1. Phosphor coating methods

Currently, there are three common methods to coat phosphor
gel in LED packaging, i.e. freely dispensed coating, conformal coating
and remote coating. Fig. 18 shows the schematics and pictures of
the corresponding phosphor morphologies in three methods. Freely
dispensed coating, as shown in Fig. 18(a), is the most convention-

al method. As presented in Fig. 7, this approach dispenses phosphor
silicone on the chip without a mold restricting the flow of the phos-
phor gel until a surface force balance is achieved. The shape of the
phosphor layer is a spherical cap. Therefore, the light color from the
central zone tends to be warm white, whereas the light color from
the edge zone tends to be cool white. The major advantage of this
method is that no special techniques are required, and thereby manu-
facturing time and cost are reduced. However, the primary
shortcoming of this approach is also evident. Specifically, it cannot
effectively control phosphor silicone volume and morphology; there-
fore the repeatability and consistency are relatively low and may
reduce the yield of products.

Conformal coating, as shown in Fig. 18(b), is a progressive pack-
aging process which can realize an extraordinarily thin phosphor
layer. To control the final color output, the concentration of the phos-
phor layer is usually high due to the thin thickness. This method
overcomes the nonuniform thickness of the phosphor layer in the
freely dispensed method, and the angular color uniformity of the
white light can be greatly enhanced. The conformal coating method
was firstly developed by Lumileds, which applied the electropho-
retic method [63] to deposit charged phosphor particles on the chip
surface. Since controlling the voltage and deposition time can adjust
the thickness of phosphor film, conformal coating can easily realize
micron precision. Other developed approaches such as slurry [64],
settling [65], and evaporating solvent [66] can also realize confor-
mal phosphor coating. Although conformal coating can achieve good
optical performance, it is confirmed by experiments that there is
still approximately 50%–60% of light that is back-scattered by the
phosphor layer [67,68]. These light rays will be re-absorbed by the
chip and part of the energy is lost due to the absorption of pack-
aging materials. Moreover, the localized heating caused by the high
power chip can induce thermal quenching and reduce the quantum
efficiency of the phosphor [69].

Fig. 18(c) shows the remote coating packaging. In this coating
process, since only a small part of the light rays will reach the chip
and be absorbed, adjusting the phosphor layer from being close to
being remote to the chip can reduce the backscattering incidents
and increase light extraction [70,71]. In addition, increased dis-
tance also improves color stability by lowering the surface
temperature of the phosphor [72]. This coating approach normal-
ly requires a reflector to fix the phosphor layer. The main
disadvantage of remote coating is that the shape of the phosphor

layer is not perfectly level. Affected by the surface tension of liquid,
the pre-cured encapsulant materials and phosphor layer normally
present concave surfaces. Some methods can partly solve this
concave surface problem such as adjusting the reflector angle, using
high viscosity silicone gel, lowering the fluid temperature, etc.
However, these methods cannot fundamentally solve this issue. Since
the viscosity of phosphor silicone is generally higher than that of
the pre-cured encapsulant, the curvature of phosphor gel will be
larger, which will cause the thickness of the phosphor layer to be
slightly greater in the central zones. Since the remote phosphor layer
is away from the LED chips, its area is usually much larger than the
area of the LED chips. Therefore, another disadvantage is that the
large-area phosphor layer will disorder the light propagation and
substantially deteriorate the re-emission light pattern because the
well-designed optics are usually just designed for the chips or small
light sources.

3.2. Fluid analysis techniques

As a viscous fluid, the flowing behavior of phosphor gel influ-
ences the phosphor coating process greatly. Elucidating this behavior
will fundamentally help to realize process control. However, this
flow is quite complex, as it is related to many factors, such as in-
ertial force, capillary force, gravitational force, wettability, porosity,
surface roughness, etc. To realize the flow analysis of phosphor
coating, the following three techniques are necessary.

3.2.1. Fluid property analysis

Phosphor gel consists of a silicone matrix and phosphor par-
ticles, and thus its fluid property is dependent on the physical
properties of silicone and phosphor parameters (concentration, par-
ticle size distribution, surface properties, etc.). In general, silicone
behaves as a shear-thinning power-law fluid with a viscosity of ap-
proximately 4 Pa·s at 20 °C and surface tension of approximately
0.031 N/m. Similarly, phosphor gel also behaves as a shear-thinning
power-law fluid, and its flowing process would influence the shear
rate, viscosity distribution and the dynamic wetting characteristic
[73,74]. However, due to silicone’s thermosetting property [75] as
well as the filling effect of phosphor particles, the viscosity, surface
tension and rheological characteristics of phosphor gel change with
the phosphor parameters and temperature.

3.2.2. Surface wettability analysis

It is well-known that surface structure substantially influences
wetting properties. Fig. 19 shows a liquid droplet on a solid sub-
strate, and there are three different phases in this case. When
gravitational forces are negligible compared to surface tensions, the
shape of the droplet is a spherical cap. Three surface tensions need
to be considered here: solid–liquid (γsl), liquid–vapor (γlv), and solid–
vapor (γsv). Young’s equation [76] gives the relation between the
equilibrium contact angle θeq and the three surface tensions as:

γ

sv

(1)

When the surface tensions differ from each other; such that γsv–
γsl–γlv > 0, Young’s equation is not satisfied for any angle θ, and the
fluid would spread over and completely wet the substrate corre-
spondingly. For macroscopic wetting, Young’s equation is sufficient
to describe the wetting state of any solid–liquid–vapor system. One
way of changing the surface properties and wetting state is through
microtexturing. According to the wetting behaviors on the rough
surfaces [77,78], two kinds of wetting states exist. When the drop-
lets reside on the top surface of the roughness surface, this is called
as Cassie–Baxter (CB) state. When the droplets impale the rough-
ness grooves, this is called as Wenzel state. Based on the fluid
properties and surface structure, we can design patterned sur-
faces or structured surfaces to realize the desired phosphor
morphology.

3.2.3. Energy and force analysis

During the flowing process, the kinetic energy, interfacial po-
tential energy, and gravitational potential energy are balanced by
the viscous dissipation, and the energy balance equation can be
written as [79]:

Fig. 20. (a) LED module with a conventional freeform lens where the inner surface
is a hemisphere and (b) LED module with a freeform lens that can realize confor-
mal phosphor coating.

without impact velocity, the capillary force and gravity are the main
driving forces. However, when they impact on a surface, the inertia
force should be taken into consideration, and the capillary effects
can be neglected if We >> Re1/2 during droplet impact [81]. For drop-
lets whose diameters are smaller than lc, gravity could be ignored.
Capillary force and interfacial tension constitute the main driving
forces in the inner flow, and the viscous force is the main resistant
force during the flowing process.

where ΔEk(t) represents the kinetic energy variation, ΔEp(t) is the
interfacial potential energy variation, ΔEg(t) is the gravitational po-
tential energy variation, and ΔLf(t) represents viscous dissipation.
Among these energies, ΔEg(t) can be neglected for tiny liquid drops;
ΔEk(t) can also be ignored for tiny liquid drops which have no impact
velocity. Conservation of energy implied that, due to the viscous dis-
sipation, the total energy of the system must decrease as the
spreading process proceeds.

Regarding force analysis, the flow of droplets is controlled by cap-
illary force, gravity, interfacial tension, viscous force and inertia force
[80]. Two dimensionless numbers are often used to characterize
droplet wetting dynamics – Weber number (We, =ρu2d/γ) and Reyn-
olds number (Re, =ρud/μ). In the definitions, ρ is the density, u is
the velocity, and d is the diameter of the droplet. The Weber number
represents the ratio of inertia force and interfacial force, while the
Reynolds number represents the ratio of inertia force and viscous
force. For droplets whose diameters are larger than the capillary
length (lc, =(γ/ρg)1/2), when they are gently dropped on the surface

Fig. 19. Young’s equation equates the surface tension forces at equilibrium.

To further enhance the efficiency of LED packaging, great efforts
have been made to discover new processes, especially for new phos-
phor coating methods based on the fluid analysis.

3.3.1. Special packaging structure

Conventional phosphor coating methods usually realize a hemi-
sphere, or spherical cap phosphor morphology, but their optical
performances are limited. To overcome these limitations, some
special packaging structures have been developed for realizing more
optimal phosphor morphologies based on fluid properties.

Kuo et al. [82] employed a pulse spray coating method to realize
a patterned remote phosphor structure, which could increase the
extraction efficiency of blue rays at a large angle, and improve the
stability of angular-dependent CCT. Liu et al. [83] proposed a mul-
tilayer phosphor configuration with a pyramidal shape and inverse
concentration distribution. Hu et al. [84] modified the convention-
al Kubelka–Munk theory to analyze the phosphor layer and proposed
the bi-layer structure with inverse concentration distribution to
enhance the light extraction efficiency. Chen et al. [85] inserted a
thin silicone layer into the dual-layer remote phosphor structure
and found that this structure enhanced lumen flux by 5% at the same
CCT. Wang and Huang [86] proposed a feedback coating method to
stack yellow, green, and red phosphor layers, so as to realize the
desired chromaticity coordinates and spectra. Hu et al. [87] real-
ized conformal phosphor coating from the aspect of packaging lens
design. Fig. 20 shows the freeform lens whose inner surface was flat
rather than a conventional hemisphere, thus when filling the space
between the lens and LED chip with phosphor gel, a conformal phos-
phor coating was formed. They used the flat inner surface to realize
the conformal coating, while used the freeform outer surface to
control the lighting characteristics. With accurate control of the light

path by the freeform lens, it was possible to realize phosphor con-
formal coating and uniform illumination simultaneously.

3.3.2. Fluid morphology control

Accurately controlling the morphology of phosphor gel consti-
tutes an advanced approach for realizing the desired optical
performance of white-light LEDs (wLEDs), since this method deals
with material modification and fluid flow behaviors on a struc-
tured surface.

Huang et al. [88] added Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) into the phos-
phor silicone composite and realized a spherical phosphor
encapsulant for white LED packaging, and Fig. 21 shows two dif-
ferent phosphor morphologies with/without PtNPs. With PtNPs, as
shown in Fig. 21(a), the curing reaction of the silicone was accel-
erated, thereby resulting in the stabilization of phosphor silicone
composite quickly. While the composite without PtNP catalyst spread
over the substrate, as shown in Fig. 21(b). The large surface area of
the PtNPs effectively catalyzed the curing reaction of the silicone.
About a 20.6% enhancement in luminous efficiency was observed.
This spherical morphology was achieved based on the fluid anal-
ysis by considering the silicone’s flowing and curing simultaneously.
Zheng and Luo [89] proposed a new substrate structure to enhance
the CCT consistency of LEDs by controlling the liquid morphology
based on wetting theory. In the wetting process, the final phos-
phor morphology meets the rule of interfacial free energy
minimization. Based on this primary rule, Zheng and Luo added two
symmetrical parts on the two sides of copper slug. When the dis-
pensed phosphor volume is too much, phosphor gel will spread along
the novel structure to keep the interfacial free energy minimal, and
the phosphor volume on the LED chip is consistent. Using their sub-
strate, the variations of phosphor volume in each coating process
could be greatly reduced and controlled, and thus the CCT consis-
tency could be improved by 42.3%. Lee et al. [90] applied surface
treatment to phosphors to improve the hydrophobic properties by
plasmas generated from a O-(Si(CH3)3)2 (HMDSO) plasma in a low-
pressure environment. They also studied the effect of surface
treatment on the total surface free energy by measuring the contact
angle. It was found that plasma treatment of phosphors signifi-
cantly improved the hydrophobicity of the phosphor gel (contact
angle >150°) and the corresponding total surface free energy de-
creased substantially. Jang et al. [91] carried out hydrophobic coating
on silicate-based yellow phosphors to improve the long-term sta-
bility and reliability of phosphors. After coating, the contact angle
of the phosphor powder increased to 133.0° for water and 140.5°
for glycerol.

3.3.3. Other typical processes for phosphor coating
3.3.3.1. Pulsed spray process. Huang et al. [92] proposed a pulsed
spray (PS) process to coat a conformal phosphor on LEDs. The PS
approach with an interval control is used to feed the phosphor slurry
through an air atomizing nozzle to spray and pile up the phos-

board (COB); and (b) the magnification of an individual LED (reprinted from Ref. 92

phor layer by layer. As a result, a thin and uniform phosphor is coated
along the perimeter of the chip. From their results, an accurate color
distribution at a wide range of CCT (from 2500 K to 9500 K) was
observed. This PS approach can also be applied to wire-bonded LED
chips and an array of chips on a board (COB). The phosphor mor-
phology coated by this PS process was shown in Fig. 22.

3.3.3.2. Capillary microchannel process. Zheng et al. demonstrated
a conformal phosphor coating method for wLEDs using a capillary
microchannel [93]. The phosphor gel flowed spontaneously in the
capillary microchannel and was pinned at the edge of the fixture
due to the surface tension effect. With experimental validations both
by conventional and vertical chips, their method could effectively
improve the angular color uniformity (ACU) of the wLEDs.

3.3.3.3. Wafer-level process. In an effort to duplicate the success of
integrated circuit (IC) packaging with LED packaging, the wafer-
level coating process is the first attempt in terms of phosphor coating.
Literally, the wafer-level process comprises coating phosphor gel
on the wafer. Zhang and Lee proposed a novel encapsulation process
for a wafer-level LED array [94]. The wafer substrates were fabri-
cated by a wafer-level lithography and plating process. Their process
takes advantage of square trenches fabricated by a deep reaction
ion etching (DRIE) process as barriers to limit the spread of the epoxy
encapsulant, and can adjust the geometry of the encapsulation via
controlling the volume of the epoxy and the dimension of the
trenches. The encapsulation array on a wafer is shown in Fig. 23(a).
Based on the concept of screen printing, Lee and Lee developed a
new methodology for coating a uniform yellow phosphor layer [95].
A silicon mold plate was fabricated with etched cavities, and served
as a printing mask. The yellow phosphor powder was pushed into
the apertures by a squeegee blade and bonded to the LED with UV
curable epoxy. The morphology of the screen-printed phosphor layer

is shown in Fig. 23(b). Liu et al. developed a new structure for 3D
wafer level LED packaging [96]. The structure consisted of a silicon
submount wafer, a silicon cap wafer, and a layer of phosphor film.
Each part was independently fabricated and subsequently as-
sembled at the wafer-level. Experimental results indicated that the
current wafer level packaging method with a remote phosphor con-
figuration could generate white light illumination with CCT ranging
from cold white to warm white. Xie et al. fabricated a novel pack-
aging structure for wafer-level LED packaging based on Si material
and a TSV array [97]. A thin layer of optical glass with phosphor
was bonded to the cavity wafer. The lumen efficiency is 106 lm/
W, the color rendering index is 70, and the color temperature is
4460 K. Compared to traditional LED, the advantages of this 3D in-
tegration package were good thermal diffusivity, high light efficiency,
and less footprint.

In addition to the above coating methods, some other coating
processes, such as electrophoresis process [63], slurry process [64],
and settling process [65], have also been developed to realize some
specific phosphor coating. These coating methods may have good
capability in phosphor morphology control, and could realize the
desired optical characteristics of LEDs. However, these methods may
refer to electrical/chemical reactions rather than fluid analysis. There-
fore, not much detail about these methods is provided here and
interested readers may refer to Refs. 63–65.

3.4. Future trends of LED phosphor coating

Phosphor coating plays a significant role in affecting the optical/
thermal performance of phosphor-converted LEDs. Obtaining a better
understanding of the heat and fluid flow behaviors of phosphor gel
will help to develop more highly-efficient packaging processes.
Trends include: (1) application-specific coating process. Based on
a full understanding and control of phosphor fluid, it may be pos-
sible to realize the optimal phosphor parameters (such as thickness,
concentration, location, morphology, distribution, etc.) to achieve
any desired CCT, luminous efficiency, color uniformity, etc. At the
same time, the product consistency and yield will be guaranteed
as well. (2) IC-compatible coating process. In the future, LEDs will
be more and more widely used and the LED amounts are exponen-
tially increasing. Analog to the success of IC packaging, LED packaging
will develop more and more IC-compatible processes. Especially, the
phosphor coating process will take example for some mature pro-
cesses in IC packaging, such as inkjet printing, nozzle printing, offset
printing, gravure printing, roll-to-roll manufacturing, etc. (3) Wafer-
level coating. As mentioned above, the development of this process
will simplify the packaging process, enhance product yield and
reduce manufacturing cost.

4. Thermal management in LED packaging and applications

4.1. Thermal resistance network of LED lamps

There are three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection
and radiation [98]. Generally, the operating temperature of LED chips
should be maintained below 120 °C, and thus heat dissipation of
LED packaging through radiation could be neglected due to the rel-
ative low temperature. This implies that in LEDs, conduction and
convection are the main heat transfer modes. The typical LED lamp
structure is shown in Fig. 24. The LED chip is mounted onto a copper
slug for heat dissipation, and is then fastened in the moulding com-
pound as LED modules. The chip size is usually 1 mm × 1 mm, while
the module is usually about 10 mm × 10 mm. Due to the high power
requirement, many modules are then attached to the printed circuit
board (PCB) substrate which is further bonded with a large heat sink.
The sizes of the typical LED lamp change from several centimeters
to meters. Thermal interface materials (TIMs) are usually chosen as
the bonding materials in this architecture. Fig. 24 also shows the
heat dissipation paths and thermal resistance network for LED pack-
aging and applications. Heat generated from the chip is dissipated
through two paths. Part of the heat generated in the typical
leadframe LEDs will take the “upper path” to dissipate through the
phosphor layer, encapsulant and optical lens; the rest of the heat
is dissipated through the “lower path”, which comprises the chip,
lead frame, and substrate. Since the encapsulant and phosphor layer
are usually made of polymer or polymeric composites with low
thermal conductivity of ~0.2 W/(m·K) [99,100], thermal resistance
at the upper path is quite large. Therefore, most heat is dissipated
through the “lower path”. Obviously, in the heat dissipation process,
heat would conduct through many materials and interfaces.

To evaluate the system thermal resistance network, the thermal
resistance network model has been developed to predict the thermal
behavior of LEDs due to its low cost and high accuracy. However,
this method relies on carefully considered approximations of the
related heat transfer phenomena [101–108]. Christensen and Graham
[109] built a thermal resistance model for Luxeon packaging LED
arrays. In their work, the thermal resistance network was ana-
lyzed in order to understand the role of various thermal resistances
in cooling the compact arrays. Han et al. [110] also developed a
thermal resistance network model for thermal analysis of Luxeon
packaging. The model was validated with the experimental data and
utilized to study the effect of key parameters on the junction tem-
perature. Using the compact thermal model, Luo et al. [111]
presented an engineering approach to predict the junction tem-
perature of high power LEDs. Detailed calculations of each thermal
resistance and the total thermal resistance were validated. Regard-

17

ing the COB packaging LED arrays, Ha and Graham [112] built a
thermal resistance model for thermal analysis. Using the analyti-
cal expression of thermal resistance, it is possible to determine the
effect of design parameters, such as material properties, LED spacing,
substrate thickness, etc., on the system thermal resistance.

In order to build the resistance network model, there are four
types of resistances that should be analyzed and calculated: (1) ma-
terials bulky resistance; (2) thermal interface material (TIM)
resistance; (3) thermal spreading resistance; and (4) component-
to-ambient resistance. Regarding materials bulky resistance, it is
usually determined by the material thermal conductivity and size.
For thermal interface resistance, it is difficult to estimate due to its
complicated mechanical and thermal properties. Thermal spread-
ing resistance constitutes a key resistance in a network, which is
largely dependent on the geometry of contacting bodies and the
thermal boundary conditions. Fig. 24 clearly shows the large change
from chip to lamp. Heat will dissipate from the small-sized chip to
the large-sized lamp, and finally to the ambient. Obviously, this will
lead to a large amount of thermal spreading resistance. Last, but
not the least, the component-to-ambient thermal resistance pre-
dominantly reflects the heat dissipation ability of the LED lamp. The
component-to-ambient resistance varies greatly from the differ-
ent solutions. In this review, three typical thermal resistances are
discussed specifically in the following sections, i.e., interface resis-
tance, spreading resistance, and component-to-ambient resistance
(or heat-sink resistance).

4.2. Thermal resistance of thermal interface material (TIM) and its
control

4.2.1. Thermal resistance of TIM

In Fig. 24, heat generated from chips must pass through several
solid–solid interfaces, such as die–slug, die–board, slug–board and
board–heat sink. It is well known [113,114] that when two solid sur-
faces are joined, as shown in Fig. 25(a), the real contact between
two bodies is established only on a few surface asperities. Conse-
quently, the heat flux Q across such interfaces needs to be constricted
at the microcontact spots. On a macroscopic scale, it brings in a tem-
perature difference (ΔT) at the interface resulting in a thermal
resistance called contact thermal resistance (Rc).

c = Δ
R

T Q

(3)

To reduce Rc, a typical thermal solution is to fill the interfacial
gap between the asperities with highly conductive materials, such
as the thermal interface materials (TIMs). Fig. 25(b) illustrates the
use of TIMs in LED packaging. The TIM 1 layer is for chip bonding,
and the TIM 2 layer is utilized for the attachment of the slug to the
board and the board to the heat sink. The most common TIM 1 in-
cludes solders and adhesives which require the reflow or curing
process when used. Fluidic polymer-based TIMs are widely used as
TIM 2, including thermal greases and phase change materials (PCMs).
By inserting the TIMs into the solid surface, as shown in Fig. 25(b),
a solid–TIM–solid joint forms at the surface. Fig. 25(b) shows that
the TIM has a finite bond line thickness (BLT) at the joint and cannot
completely fill the gap due to its inability to completely wet the
surface [115]. Therefore, thermal resistance of TIM (RTIM) has two
components: the bulk resistance of the TIM (Rbulk) arising from its
finite BLT and the Rc at the TIM–solid interface arising from the in-
complete wetting. From Fig. 25(b), RTIM can be written as:

(4)

From Eq. (4), we can see that there are three factors that deter-
mine RTIM: (1) Rc; (2) thermal conductivity of TIM (kTIM); and (3) BLT.

Fig. 25. Schematic showing (a) Rc at the solid–solid interface, and (b) RTIM at the
solid–TIM–solid joint.

One typical TIM is solder, which possesses relatively large thermal
conductivity [116–118]. However, the continuing increase in pack-
aging density of LEDs has resulted in a major challenge concerning
on reliability of this interconnect material. For the solder joints, one
primary factor that hinders joint reliability is the void formation
during the reflow process [119–126]. Panton et al. [119] simu-
lated void growth in molten solder bumps. The physical model in
the study shows that the bubble motion is subjected to buoyancy
force, drag force produced by the bulk fluid viscous flow, and the
thermocapillary self-propulsion effect. The simulation results can
predict the final locations and sizes of the voids after the reflow
process. Experiments were also conducted to identify the loca-
tions and measure the sizes of the voids in the solder bumps [120].
It is found that the predicted results match well with the experi-
mental findings. Ume and Jie [125] also detected the voids of solder
bumps by various techniques, such as 2-D X-ray, 3-D X-ray, acous-
tic inspection and laser-ultrasound.

Another kind of TIM is the polymer-based TIMs which are pre-
dominantly manufactured by introducing highly thermally
conductive particles such as ceramics, metals, and metal oxides into
the polymer matrix [126–128]. In 2006, Prasher [129] conducted
a comprehensive review of the polymer-based TIMs by discussing
and analyzing the models of kTIM, BLT and Rc. Since then, some pro-
gress has been made on models and new solutions for the reduction
of RTIM. Thus we would like to introduce the developments from the
aspects of the three factors in Eq. (4) here.

4.2.1.1. Rc models. Past literature is replete with models of Rc at the
solid–solid interface [113,114,130–133]. These studies have all as-
serted that Rc is a function of surface roughness, slope of asperity,

By analyzing the models at

apparent area of contact, mechanical properties of solid bodies, and
load between the surfaces. However, these models are not suit-
able for modeling the TIMs–solid contact, because the mechanical
properties, such as the hardness and Young’s modulus, cannot be
defined for polymer-based materials which possess liquid properties.
the solid–solid contacts
[113,114,131–138], the development of models should take account
of both topographical and mechanical analyses at the contact. Based
on the solid–solid models, some models for the liquid–solid contact
have been built. Prasher [115] has modeled Rc of PCM and grease
based on the definition of Rc proposed by Madhusudana [114]. Taking
the wettability of the TIM on rough surface into consideration and
by mechanical analysis, the model successfully illustrated the in-
terface characteristics at the TIM–solid contact. The model is based
on the surface geometry assumption that the solid asperities are
conical in shape and the spacing of the peaks and valleys is equal
to the roughness sampling interval. However, the roughness
sampling interval cannot be used to describe surface topography
because it is a profilometer parameter used to modify the rough-
ness measurement conditions [139]. Heichal and Chandra [140] have
modeled the Rc between molten metal droplets and a solid surface.
In this model, the rough surface was idealized as a series of half-
cylinders with same ratio placed next to each other. However, this
description of surfaces was concerned that the substrates were pol-
ished with emery paper in one direction [140,141]. Recently,
Hamasaiid et al. [142,143] developed a predictive model for the
casting-die interface. The advantages of this model are assuming
that the heights of asperity follow a Gaussian distribution which
is more acceptable for describing the surface topography [113], and
using a parameter, mean asperity peak spacing (Rsm), as the spacing
of the peaks and valleys. Fig. 26(a) schematically presents the profile
of the liquid–solid interface based on the topographic assumption
of Hamasaiid’s model [143]. Based on the definition of Rc in the CMY
model [113], the authors expressed Rc as function of the effective
thermal conductivity of the contacting bodies ks, mean asperity peak
spacing (Rsm), root-mean-square deviation of the profile (σ) and the
height of entrapped air (Y) between the liquid and solid surfaces:

In the model, Y is found to influence Rc strongly and deter-
mined by the mechanical analysis. The analysis in Hamasaiid’s model
is completed by evaluating the capillarity pressure of the molten
alloy as a function of the applied pressure through experiments.
However, this method is difficult to apply in the estimation of Y in
TIM–solid contact. Based on Hamasaiid’s model, Yuan et al. [144]
proposed an improved model for the prediction of Rc at the TIM–
solid interface. In the model, wettability analysis at the interface
was conducted to calculate Y. As shown in Fig. 26(b), when TIM im-
pinges on the solid surface, it spreads out and wets the microcavity
of the solid surface. An equilibrium state is then established at the
interface among the applied pressure P, the capillarity pressure due
to the surface tension of TIM γl, and the back pressure of air. By ap-
plying the ideal gas equilibrium equation on the entrapped air, it
is possible to calculate the Y for the microcavities [144]. Rc at the
TIM–aluminum interface was also measured for comparison with
the modeling results. The modeling results were found to match the
experimental data within 14.3% when the applied pressure was
0.1 MPa.

4.2.1.2. kTIM. Polymer-based TIMs are filled with highly conduc-
tive particles and considered as composites. In addition to the

Fig. 26. Schematic of (a) profile of the TIM–solid interface; and (b) spreading of TIM
on the solid rough surface.

intrinsic properties of fillers, thermal properties of composites
depend on the filler loading [100,128], geometry [145,146], orien-
tation to the thermal gradient [145,147–149], distribution
[127,150–152], and interfacial properties [100,128]. Much litera-
ture exists regarding the kTIM models of composites. Prasher [128]
has reviewed and discussed the most common and important the-
oretical models, such as the Maxwell–Garnett model (MG) [153–155],
Bruggeman’s symmetric model (BSM) [156], Bruggeman’s asym-
metric model (BAM) [157], the percolation model [158–162], and
the resistive network model [100,163,164]. These models focus on
homogenous composites filled with randomly distributed spheri-
cal or cubic particles. However, with the increasing use of new non-
spherical fillers in TIMs, such as graphene nanosheets (GNPs), boron
nitride (BN) platelets and carbon nanotube (CNT), TIMs have become
the heterogeneous materials with anisotropic kTIM. Apart from the
geometry, the anisotropic thermal property of fillers is another reason
for the anisotropy of kTIM. For example, GNP, with a high aspect ratio,
has an in-plane thermal conductivity of ~2000 W/(m·K), whereas
the through-plane thermal conductivity is less than 1 W/mK
[165,166]. The experimental results [167] show that kTIM of GNP-
epoxy in the horizontal direction can be five times higher than that
in the vertical direction when GNPs are oriented horizontally. There-
fore, the geometry of fillers should be taken into consideration in
developing the models.

Lewis and Nielsen (LN) [168] modified the Halpin–Tsai equa-
tion [169] to build a thermal conductivity model. Their model
considers the effect of particles shape and orientation, and the type
of packing for a two-phase system. However, this model does not
include the interface resistance between the particle and the matrix
which is found to have a dramatic effect on thermal conductivity

19

according to the extant literatures [100,128]. Thermal interface re-
sistance arises from the combination of a poor mechanical or
chemical adherence at the interface and a thermal expansion mis-
match [100,128]. Based on the Maxwell–Garnett model [153], Nan
and Birringer [170] derived an effective medium approximation
(EMA) formulation for predicting the effective thermal conductiv-
ity of composites made of arbitrary ellipsoidal particles dispersed
in a matrix. The formulation is for four limited cases: (1) aligned
continuous fibers, (2) laminated flat plates, (3) spheres and (4) com-
pletely misoriented ellipsoidal particles. One of the advantages of
the EMA formulation is that it considers the effect of interface re-
sistance. The LN model and EMA have been applied in previous
studies [171–173] for thermal conductivity prediction of compos-
ites filled with platelets or penny-shaped particles, such as BN, GNP,
SiC, Al2O3, etc. Compared to the experimental results, the predic-
tion of the model or formulation does not match well. According
to the studies [171,173,174], a model called the Hatta–Taya (HT)
model is useful in predicting the thermal conductivity of platelet-
filled composites. Hatta and Taya [175] used an equivalent inclusion
method to build the predictive model as expressed:

stress of the material τy and the applied pressure P. τy can be ex-
pressed as [179]

where km and kp are the thermal conductivities of the matrix and
particles, respectively; f is the particles volume fraction; and Si is
a factor dependent on filler shape and direction. When the matrix
// = π 4

p
⊥ = −1 2 // (perpendicular) where the variable p (= tp/
(parallel) or S
d) is the inverse of the particle aspect ratio, tp and d are the thickness
and diameter of the particle, respectively.

S

In addition to geometry and orientation, particle distribution also
has a great effect on kTIM. Devpura et al. [176] illustrated the effect
through percolation theory [177]. As the high thermally conduc-
tive particles form a continuous chain from heat source to heat sink,
there is a sudden increase in thermal conductivity. McCullough [178]
also emphasized that increasing the filler concentration promotes
the formation of preferential paths for heat conduction passing
through the composite. Khiabani et al. [151] studied the effect of
squeeze flow on the thermal properties of particulate TIMs by means
of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). They first obtained the parti-
cle distribution by simulating the squeezing process, and found that
two particle stack lines form in diagonal directions. After calculat-
ing the temperature and heat flux distribution of TIMs, it is found
that there was relatively lower temperature and higher heat flux
in the diagonal directions.

4.2.1.3. BLT. The BLT of particle-filled TIM should depend on the rhe-
ology of the material [128]. There are four types of constitutive
models used to explain the rheological behavior of polymers: (1)
Newtonian fluid, (2) Power Law fluid, (3) Bingham fluid and (4)
Herschel–Bulkley (H–B) fluid [179]. For these fluids with constant
radii located between two substrates, the theoretical formulation
of thickness has been summarized by Prasher et al. [128] It is found
that Newtonian and Power Law fluid models cannot be used to model
BLT of particle-filled TIM because the steady state thickness of the
two fluid models is assumed as to be zero, which is unrealistic.
Prasher et al. [128] found that these models underestimated the BLT
of TIMs greatly and proposed a polymer rheology based empirical
model:

BLT =

where C and M are 1.31 × 10−4 and 0.166, respectively [130]. This
model shows that BLT of particle-filled TIM depends on the yield

where A and fm are the constant and maximum particle volume frac-
tion, respectively. Thus τy depends on the particle volume fraction
f. The analytical models [153–157] show that kTIM of particle-filled
TIM also depends on f. Many studies [128,180–183] have found that,
as shown in Fig. 27, filling the TIM with a high volume fraction of
particles can only be effective in decreasing Rbulk when the filling
fraction f is less than the critical f. In this period, the filling will in-
crease the kTIM and kTIM dominates the filling influence. When the
filling fraction f is larger than the critical f, the BLT starts to dom-
inate and causes Rbulk to increase. Therefore, when decreasing the
Rbulk, the fillers and the fraction should be well designed.

4.2.2. Thermal resistance of TIM control

According to Eq. (4), reduction of RTIM can be achieved by re-
ducing Rc, increasing kTIM and reducing BLT. Based on models
[115,144], Rc can be decreased by increasing the applied pressure,
using the TIMs with high surface tension and thermal conductiv-
ity, and machining the substrate with low surface roughness.

kTIM is often reinforced by increasing the filler volume fraction
[128]. However, as mentioned above, a high volume fraction of par-
ticles may increase the bulk resistance of TIM due to the increase
of BLT. In addition to particles loading, kTIM can also be reinforced
by controlling the particles orientation. Inspired by the HT model
[175], aligning the platelet-shaped fillers in the direction of heat
load can greatly enhance the thermal performance of TIMs. As il-
lustrated in Fig. 28, the TIM layer is expected to provide efficient
heat flow from the heat source to the heat sink in the direction
normal to the layer. The ideal orientation of fillers is normal to the
TIM plane (Fig. 28a), whereas the isotropic and parallel orienta-
tions (Fig. 28b and 28c) are much less favorable. Several synthetic
approaches have been applied to prepare the polymer composites
containing the well-aligned fillers, such as electrical fields [127], mag-
netic fields [172], tape-casting [173], spin-coating combined with
thermal imidization [174], and gravitational force [183]. Control-
ling the filler distribution is another effective method to increase
kTIM. Yung and Liem [150] enhanced the thermal conductivity of com-
posites by filling different size particles in a matrix. Through multi-
modal particle mixing, the smaller particles can fill the gaps between

20

this technology, as seen in Fig. 27, the optimal volume fraction fo2
is higher than fo1. In addition, Rae et al. [152] made a qualitative
analysis of the particle stacking by assuming particle-filled TIM as
a deformable porous media made up of the particles. They found
that the squeeze rate had a great effect on the steady state BLT. In
this work, the sample prepared with a relatively high squeeze rate
tended to be thinner than those prepared with reduced squeeze rates.
The increase of power density and integration in LEDs requires
lower total thermal resistance at the TIMs layer. A large body of re-
search exists concerning the models and optimization of kTIM.
However, the increase of kTIM may be not helpful for decreasing re-
sistance. Models for Rc and BLT are still insufficient, and technical
methods which focus on their reduction are scarce. Although using
advanced materials as TIMs is inevitable, the exploitation of these
materials should follow fundamental physical-based models to obtain
their full advantages.

4.3. Thermal spreading resistance and its control

4.3.1. Thermal spreading resistance

LED chips are on the scale of millimeters, while LED modules
are on the scale of centimeters, and the sizes of LED lamps may
change from several centimeters to several meters. This large size
difference leads to large thermal spreading resistance (Rs) in the in-
ternal heat conduction process [187]. Thermal spreading resistance,
which occurs when a small heat source comes in contact with the
base of a larger plate, is a key form of thermal resistance in thermal
modeling of LED packages and applications. Fig. 29 shows a simu-
lation result for such an occurrence. When the areas of the chip and
the substrate are the same, the temperature is uniform through-
out; however, when the chip is much smaller than the substrate,
the temperature is obviously nonuniform and the hot spot phe-
nomenon exists. Rs is an increasingly important issue in thermal
management, as microelectronic/LED packages become increas-
ingly powerful and compact. In high heat flux applications, Rs can
comprise 60–70% of the total thermal resistance. When Rs is large,
heat will not be distributed uniformly throughout the plate and will
result in a hot spot.

4.3.2. Thermal spreading resistance control

Regarding the control of thermal spreading resistance, the first
step is to develop methods to calculate or evaluate resistance.
Kennedy [188] found analytical solutions in a cylinder with a con-
stant heat flux over a part of one end and a variety of boundary
conditions at the other surfaces. Kadambi and Abuaf [189] and Krane
[190] obtained analytical solutions in two- and three-dimensional
(2D and 3D) rectangular bodies with insulated sides and a convec-
tive boundary condition on the surface opposite to the heat input.
Ellison et al. [191] derived an exact 3D solution for the steady state
heat conduction equation with the source on an otherwise adia-
batic surface and Newtonian cooling on the opposing surface.
Muzychka et al. [192–198] studied Rs from a variety of aspects, in-
cluding heat source location, boundary conditions and types of flux
channel, and provided a series of analytical expressions for the cal-
culation of Rs. These works provide methods to deal with the single
LED packages and multiple LEDs or LED array.

With the formula of Rs, many methods have been developed to
control thermal spreading resistance. One convenient and intu-
itive method is to simply increase the ratio of the heat source size
to its heat sink. Based on this, it is common to use an LED array with
lower single chip power to decrease Rs. Fig. 30 shows the influ-
ence of Rs on temperature distribution under different heat source
distributions. It is seen in Fig. 30 that a centered heat source leads
to large Rs and hotspot phenomenon, while distributed heat sources
with the same power input can decrease Rs and cause a more uniform
temperature distribution and a lower junction temperature. This con-

the bigger particles and matrix, forming the preferential paths for
heat conduction. Rae et al. [152] found that thermal conductivity
of the heterogeneous composites can be greater than that of com-
posites filled with homogeneously distributed particles. The
heterogeneity of composites in that work was driven by squeeze
flow during which filler particles become entrapped and com-
pacted, while the polymer matrix continues to flow. Moreover, some
studies focus on the reduction of the interface resistance between
matrix and fillers to increase kTIM. This approach relies on the ef-
fective surface treatments for the fillers. Xu and Chung [126] made
surface treatments for BN and AlN particles using acetone, acids,
and silane. The results show that these treatments can increase the
thermal conductivity of BN and AlN particle epoxy-matrix com-
posites by up to 97%. Through experiments, Yung and Liem [150]
also found that adding the silane coupling agent enhances the ef-
fective thermal conductivity of the polymer composite material.

Recently, a trend exists to use extremely high thermal conduc-
tivity materials, such as CNTs, tin nanowires, and graphene as the
reinforcements in TIMs or TIMs directly. Biercuk et al. [184] pre-
pared composites loaded with 1 wt% unpurified single-wall CNTs.
The composites showed a 125% increase in thermal conductivity at
room temperature. Feng et al. [185] produced a TIM based on double-
sided array of tin nanowires. This material is prepared using a hot-
pressing approach with the assistance of anodic aluminum oxide
templates. The results indicate that RTIM of two rough copper sur-
faces assisted by the tin nanowires array can reduce to 20 mm2 K W−1
at 1 MPa. Shahil and Balandin [146] produced graphene–multilayer
graphene nanocomposites as the highly efficient TIMs. The kTIM mea-
surements revealed a dramatic enhancement by 2300% in the
graphene-based polymer at the filler loading fraction of 10 vol %.
Based on Prasher’s model [128], BLT can be decreased by in-
creasing the applied pressure and decreasing the yield stress of TIMs.
However, conventional TIMs, with high particles loading, general-
ly possess large yield stress resulting in a high BLT. Therefore, it is
necessary to find effective technical solutions to reduce BLT. Through
experiments, Brunschwiler et al. [186] found that two particle stack
lines form in diagonal directions when the TIM is placed between
two flat plates. Khiabani et al. [151] also found this phenomenon
by simulations. Based on these observations, the hierarchical nested
channel interface technology (HNC) [186] was proposed recently
to achieve thin TIMs but with high particle loadings. In this tech-
nology, channels are machined along the bifurcation lines in one
of the solid surfaces, which can prevent particle stacking and pre-
serve material uniformity during bondline formation. By means of

stitutes an important rule in designing LED packages and
applications.

Therefore, many researchers optimized LED distribution to de-
crease the junction temperature according to this rule. Yang et al.
[199] analyzed the effect of LED chip size on thermal spreading
resistance by both simulations and experiments. They found that
when the chip size increased from 15 mil to 40 mil, the total thermal
resistance decreases exponentially and the thermal spreading re-
sistance had a great effect on the total thermal resistance of LED
packages. They also found that for LED modules with the same
substrate thickness and power input, using graphite composite to
replace aluminum as the substrate material reduced the spread-
ing resistance by nearly 14%. Yang et al. [200] studied the thickness
of copper substrate on the thermal spreading resistance in LED
packages. They found that with the initial increase in copper thick-
ness (up to 0.6 mm), the total thermal resistance (Rcu) of the copper
substrate decreases with the copper thickness, which is attribut-
able to the decrease in Rs. Afterwards, Rcu starts to lightly increase
with the copper thickness, which is attributable to the increases

of the bulky thermal resistance of the copper substrate. The
minimum Rcu value occurs at the copper thickness of about 0.6 mm.
Concerning LED lamps that assemble many LED modules onto a
board (e.g., PCB or MCPCB), thermal spreading resistance becomes
the dominant resistance since the size difference is very large. In
this circumstance, it would be desirable to optimize the LED dis-
tribution to control the thermal spreading resistance. Cheng et al.
[201] applied the thermal spreading resistance network to opti-
mize the LED chip arrangement for an 80 W LED lamp. Ha and
Graham [112] analyzed the thermal resistance of LED-array as a
function of pitch (chip distance) by the analytical method and com-
pared with the FEA simulations, as shown in Fig. 31. The pitch was
found to be an important factor in determining the thermal resis-
tance of LED array. Although the larger pitch can achieve a lower
thermal resistance, the pitch is usually determined by considering
other factors such as optical performance. For effective thermal man-
agement, it is better to minimize the interference of heat spreading
in the substrate level with tuning the substrate type, thickness of
each layer, etc.

thermal solutions are chosen on the basis of power, heat source area,
heat dissipation space, application situations, etc.

Thermal management solutions for LED applications can be
divided into passive cooling and active cooling, just as the solu-
tions for electronic devices. The key difference between these two
methods is whether an external power source is needed. Passive
cooling generally does not use a power source, such as a heat sink
by natural convection and a heat pipe; whereas, active cooling means
that there is a power source, such as forced convection with a cooling
fan and liquid delivery pump. Compared to active cooling, passive
cooling offers the advantages of simple structure, easy fabrication,
flexibility, low cost, and high reliability. However, the heat dissi-
pation capacity and efficiency of passive cooling are always limited
by its dimensions and structure. For some high thermal density ap-
plications, passive cooling is insufficient, and active cooling is
required.

4.4.1. Passive cooling
4.4.1.1. Substrate. The first component that LED chips or modules
are packaged on is the substrate. Currently, LED substrates can be
classified into five types [202,203]. (1) PCB (printed circuit board)
is the most widely used LED substrate, which is composed of fiber
glass and an epoxy resin material (FR4). FR4 is a composite mate-
rial composed of woven fiberglass cloth and an epoxy resin binder,
and is nearly impermeable to water. However, the thermal con-
ductivity of FR-4 is very low (through-plane: 0.29–0.34 W/(m·K);
in-plane: 0.81–1.1 W/(m·K)). The manufacturing and fabrication of
PCBs are quite mature and low-cost, but its disadvantage is its poor
thermal performance, resulting in low power (much less than 1 W).
An inexpensive way to improve its thermal conductivity is to add
thermal vias, which are created by drilling holes and copper plating
them [204]. (2) MCPCBs (metal core printed circuit boards) are at-
tached by a metal plate (Al- or Cu-thin plate) to increase thermal
conductivity in PCBs. The merit of this kind of LED is that the contact
surface temperature of a MCPCB is much lower than that of a PCB.
However, the thermal conductivity is still at a low level because of
the dielectric materials inside. (3) IMSs (insulated metal sub-
strates) create a legal system (insulated level) by accumulating high
polymer dielectric level etch copper coil electric circuits or printed
circuits. This is accomplished by adhesive direct bonding on the Al-
or Cu-plate with no PCB/FR4 materials in between. The thermal con-
ductivity can be enhanced to about 1.6 W/(m·K). (4) CSs (ceramic
substrates) are increasingly used as alternatives to PCB or MCPCB.
In CSs, a thin layer of high polymer dielectric materials is coated
onto the metal surfaces to block the electric conduction in the metal
plate. The thermal conductivity of CSs could be enhanced to about
50 W/(m·K), and the CTE is about 4 ppm/K. The disadvantage of this
kind of substrate is its high cost with the size limited to about 5
in2 or below. (5) DCBS (direct copper bonded substrate) is an ad-
vanced technology. The manufacturing process passes over O2 and
N2 to interface between the copper plate and the ceramics (Al2O3,
AlN), and a thin layer of CuO forms with the Cu surface reaction.
Then, when heated, the CuO and Al2O3 or AlN interact to form the
insulated compound. When the dielectric level is Al2O3, the thermal
conductivity is about 24 W/(m·K), and the CTE is about 7 ppm/K.
When the dielectric level is AlN, the thermal conductivity is about
170 W/(m·K), and the CTE is about 6 ppm/K. The DCBS exhibits the
best thermal performance among the above mentioned kinds of LED
substrates.

4.4.1.2. Fin heat sink. Although the heat dissipation efficiency of the
fin heat sink is usually limited, it is the most widely used thermal
solution. In addition to passive cooling, the fin heat sink is also used
in active cooling, e.g., fins are used to cool the heated working liquid
in microchannels, microjets, etc. Therefore, the fin heat sink is the
most fundamental method to dissipate heat to the ambient. In LED

substrates (reprinted from Ref. 112 with permission of Elsevier).

Another method to control thermal spreading resistance com-
prises focusing on the substrates. However, the ability of bulky
substrate optimization (e.g., material, size, structure, etc.) to control
thermal spreading resistance is quite limited. The substrate coupled
with some other working mechanism, such as phase change, is pre-
ferred. As a result, a flat heat pipe or vapor chamber offers an optimal
solution to control thermal spreading resistance. Generally, they are
fabricated as advanced substrates to assemble LEDs. A detailed dis-
cussion of these advanced solutions will be presented in the
following section.

4.4. Component-to-ambient thermal resistance control

To effectively dissipate the heat in LEDs to the ambient is the ul-
timate goal of thermal management. The thermal resistance in this
process is called component-to-ambient thermal resistance and is
different from thermal solutions. In LED applications, different

lamp design, placing the LED packaging onto a metallic board and
then attaching it to a heat sink is recognized as a common method.
Here, heat generated in LEDs is thus dissipated to the ambient from
the attached heat sink via either natural convection or forced con-
vection. So far, in LED packaging and products, studies of the fin heat
sink can be classified into three categories.

4.4.1.2.1. Fin design and optimization. When selecting a proper
heat sink that meets the required thermal criteria, one needs to
evaluate/examine various fin parameters that affect heat sink
efficiency and the overall performance of the system. Fin heat
sink design methodology has been well outlined by many research-
ers [205–211]. Among the extensive studies on fin heat sink in
LED applications, most researchers focus on the optimization of
fin parameters, including spacing, height, configurations, orienta-
tion, etc., through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, or
experiments. Changing fin parameters is the most effective way to
optimize fin performance, and many methods have been devel-
oped, such as the least energy method [212], the least entropy
generation method [213–218], the minimum entransy dissipation-
based thermal resistance principle [219–223], etc. The enhancement
of fin efficiency results in the decrease of LED junction tempera-
ture directly. Charles and Wang [224] designed different fin patterns,
including rectangular, trapezoidal and inverted trapezoidal config-
uration. They found that the heat transfer coefficient of the
inverted trapezoidal fins was higher than the trapezoidal and
rectangular ones by ~25% and ~10%, respectively. Luo et al. [225]
developed a semi-empirical algorithm to optimize plate fin heat
sink for LED street lamp application, of which the basic optimiza-
tion flowchart is shown in Fig. 32. The fin height, fin thickness and
fin spacing of horizontal plate fin heat sinks were designed and
optimized with the aim of maximal heat dissipation and the least
material. The method is based on empirical equations, and is
relatively simple for engineers.

4.4.1.2.2. Fin heat sink design in specific LED applications.
Considering the working characteristics of LED applications, such
as chip distribution, orientation, heat flux density, and system space,
some specific thermal designs were developed by simulations or
experiments. Shyu et al. [226] experimentally investigated a 270 W
LED backlight panel with a plate fin heat sink. Rather than the fin
parameters, they analyzed the effect of shroud clearance and ob-
structions at the entrance or exit on overall performance were
examined. This is the typical specific case for LED applications. Luo
et al. [227] examined the thermal behavior of a 4 W LED bulb and
then designed a heat dissipation structure for a 16 W LED bulb.

4.4.1.2.3. Special fin heat sink design with new material or
structure. Some researchers improved fin efficiency by changing the
working principles of the conventional fin heat sink. Yang et al. [228]
brazed a layer of metal foam and carbon foam on the n fin surface.
Through experiments, they found that the metal/carbon foam could
enhance the heat transfer performance due to the relatively higher
emissivity. Meanwhile, the weight of the heat sink was reduced as
much as 33%. Yang et al. [229] developed a thermosyphon heat sink
that utilized the phase change of the working liquid inside the heat
sink. Their design takes advantage of the heat pipe and conven-
tional heat sink, and thus good performance was achieved in LED
street lamps. Huang et al. [230] developed a plastic fin sink which
uses the enhancement of surface emissivity and geometry surface
area to compensate for the deterioration of heat dissipation ability
caused by the plastic materials in a 7 W LED lamp. Fig. 33 shows a
fin heat sink comparison with a conventional aluminum fin heat
sink. It is observed that the maximal temperature increased by 3 °C;
however, the material weight and cost will be sharply decreased.
Jang et al. [231] focused on a radial heat sink for LED lighting
applications, i.e., in which both convection and radiation are con-
sidered. Kim et al. [232] reports hybrid pin fins with internal channels
to cool high power LEDs under natural convection or forced

convection. Near the bottom of the heat sink, they drilled some holes
to inhale the air. The heated air flows upward and the chimney effect
was utilized to enhance heat dissipation efficiency greatly. Fig. 34
displayed this fin design. Although it is clear that the heat transfer
coefficient will increase greatly due to the chimney effect, it may
also raise the manufacturing costs.

4.4.1.3. Heat pipe and vapor chamber. Heat pipe technology is an ad-
vanced alternative efficient cooling method, which can transfer heat
while keeping a relatively uniform temperature distribution owing
to the inherent phase change heat transfer mechanism. The general
working principle is that the working liquid absorbs heat in the evap-
oration region and changes to vapor. The vapor will flow in the whole
space inside the heat pipe, and then condense to a liquid in the con-
densation region. The condensed liquid will then flow back to the
evaporation region through wicks. Continuing this cycle, the heat
in electronic devices (e.g., LEDs) will be transferred efficiently to the

from Ref. 232 with permission of IEEE).

ambient. From the working principle, there are no moving parts in
a heat pipe and simple fluids, such as water, can be used as the
working fluid. There are different types of heat pipe cooling methods,
such as heat pipes, loop heat pipes, vapor chambers (or called as
flat plate heat pipes), but they all share the similar working prin-
ciples. The difference between heat pipes and vapor chambers is
that the heat transfer in heat pipes is in one dimension, but in a
vapor chamber, it is in two dimensions, thus the heat transfer ef-
ficiency is enhanced greatly in vapor chambers.

Since heat pipes are advanced passive cooling methods that are
suitable for cooling electronics, numerous studies exist on heat pipes
that are applied in LED packages or products. Three categories can
be identified as follows.

4.4.1.3.1. Performance study of heat pipes. For LED applications,
the large difference in size between LED chips and substrate results
in a large temperature difference between the LED chips and the
edges of the substrates. In this situation, vapor chambers are proven
to be potential alternatives to solve this problem. It is demon-
strated that a sophisticated design of a vapor chamber provides an
equivalent thermal conductivity of 6500–7000 W/(m·K), which is
much larger than that of a metal substrate [233,234]. To fulfill this
target, many researchers focused on the performance improve-
ment of heat pipes or vapor chambers in terms of the reduction of
thermal resistance. Lu et al. [235] applied a vapor chamber coupled
heat sink for high power LEDs and the total thermal resistance was
8.8 K/W at 3 W. The thermal spreading resistance of a vapor chamber
could be as low as 0.38 K/W from Wang and coworkers [203]. Huang
et al. [236] applied a lamp-type vapor chamber to high power LED
systems in natural convection, and found that thermal spreading
resistance was lower than the metal plate by 34% at 30 W. Li et al.
[237] fabricated a copper–water loop heat pipe (LHP) for LED illu-
mination applications. They found that total thermal resistance
ranged from 1.0 to 0.4 K/W (heating loads ranged from 30 W to
300 W). Hu et al. [238] fabricated a flat-plate vapor chamber by sin-
tering copper powders and diffusion bonding. The transient and

25

steady temperature distributions of the flat plate vapor chamber
were experimentally measured. The results illustrate that the vapor
chamber can realize low thermal resistance (~0.3 K/W) and achieve
good temperature uniformity. It could be concluded that heat pipes
or vapor chambers, if well designed and fabricated, possess excel-
lent thermal behavior in terms of heat transportation and spreading
with low thermal resistance. However, in heat pipes or vapor cham-
bers, some limitations confine thermal performance, in particular,
the maximum heat transfer rate. The most obvious factors under
common operations are capillary and boiling limits, as these factors
will cause the dry-out phenomenon, leading to heat pipe failure.
In fact, these two limitations cannot be eliminated but only post-
poned. By increasing the capillary pressure and permeability of the
inner wick structure, the heat transfer rate may be enhanced.

4.4.1.3.2. Novel heat pipes based on new materials or
structures. Yang et al. [239] investigated a polymer vapor chamber
with copper micro thermal via, and found that the use of thermal
via design reduced the lateral thermal resistance by 20–25%. Ye et al.
[240] designed a polymer based loop heat pipe (LHP) and as-
sembled with a silicon substrate to cool an LED package. The polymer
LHP exhibited light weight and transparency, and could enhance the
thermal conductivity of polymers. A group of sensors can provide
accurate temperature measurement. Their present design could
supply a low and relatively stable temperature to maintain higher
optical power, more luminous flux and less color shift. Luo et al. [241]
fabricated a silicon-glass microheat pipes (MHPs) to cool a 10 W
high-power LED module. Grooves were fabricated on the silicon
wafer and ionized water was chosen as the working fluid in the
MHPs. Improved performance was observed with comparison ex-
periments. Lin et al. [242] fabricated an aluminum plate oscillating
heat pipes (OHPs) to cool 64 W LED modules. A series of parallel
interconnected rectangular channels were manufactured as a me-
andering closed loop in an aluminum plate. The results showed that
the LED temperature significantly decreased by natural convec-
tion when a plate OHP was used.

Liu et al. [243] studied a bionic transpiration heat pipe system
for LED cooling, which is inspired by the physiological process of
plant transpiration. The system consisted of the following inter-
pretations. As shown in Fig. 35, the leaf section of a plant served
as a membrane (water-permeable, micro/nano porous) across which
the ambient water vapor (AWV) quasi-equilibrated with the satu-
rated liquid water inside of the membrane under the same low
pressure. A net flux of water vapor emitting into the ambient air
occurred, and the pressure difference between the ambient air and
the AWV was balanced by the across-membrane pressure differ-
ence and the tension of the AWV. The system enabled the extraction
of water, and the extracted water evaporated on the way, absorb-
ing a considerable amount of heat from the ambient. This comprised
a heat pipe or a heat pipe cluster resembling a xylem vasculature,
as indicated in Fig. 35. Their simulation results demonstrated that
the bionic transpiration heat pipe used in LED cooling could main-
tain an average temperature below 55.6 °C.

4.4.1.3.3. Coupled with some specific LED applications. Except for
the above directions, some researchers have focused on the spe-
cific application of heat pipes with LED applications. Tang et al. [244]
investigated the thermal performance of LED street light modules
with and without heat pipes. The improvement of heat dissipa-
tion with heat pipes was significant. Thermal resistance could be
reduced by over 50% with heat pipes compared with the module
without heat pipes. Fu et al. [245] designed and manufactured a
1000 W high-power LED tennis court lamp with a heat pipe-fin air
cooling system. Due to the volume requirement, a large fin heat sink
could be replaced by a compact one with heat pipes. Simulation
results showed that the highest LED temperature was controlled at

permission of IEEE).

92 °C, which could guarantee an acceptable thermal and reliabili-
ty performance.

4.4.2. Active cooling

Not all LED applications can be passively cooled. Higher power
LEDs usually require higher levels of cooling than standard heat sinks
can provide. In such cases, active cooling methods are preferred due
to the great enhancement in heat dissipation ability. Generally, the
active cooling methods that are suitable for LEDs include forced air
cooling and liquid cooling. These two methods will be discussed in
detail as follows.

4.4.2.1. Forced air cooling. Forced air cooling is often necessary for
applications in which the volume/surface area is small or the ambient
temperature is high, and thus natural convection is inadequate to
dissipate the heat in time [246–248]. Forced convection is driven
by externally powered components, such as a fan or a pump, which
can generate a high air flow rate and achieve one or two orders of
magnitude higher heat transfer coefficient compared to that in
natural convection. Therefore, forced air cooling can endure a lower
temperature difference over the ambient according to Newton’s
cooling law. Forced air cooling systems can help provide the needed
heat dissipation levels for high power LEDs, although not as quietly,
dependably, or reliably as passive heat sinks cool lower power LEDs.
They are not orientation-dependent, but typically cost more than
passive cooling due to their complexity and power consumption.
Therefore, a balance between performance and reliability needs to
be considered when choosing the fin heat sink to cool LEDs light
sources. In forced air cooling, a fin heat sink is usually coupled to
provide a highly-efficient, highly-reliable cooling solution for LEDs.
The studied on fin heat sink, whether applied in passive cooling
(natural convection) or in active cooling (forced convection, forced
air cooling), falls in the range of parameter optimization, new ma-
terials or structures, coupling with some specific LED application,

26

resistance can be reduced by 50% in the LED thermal performance
test.

4.4.2.2. Liquid cooling. Liquid cooling can enhance thermal man-
agement with a simple structure, transparency and small weight.
Furthermore, liquid can remove the heat rather than conduct it, and
thus liquid performs as better “thermal conductivity” than solid.
Liquid cooling has already been successively applied in many mi-
croelectronic applications and will be easily transferred to LEDs. In
some LEDs, the output power is likely to go up to 3–10 W for a single
chip where the heat flux can be very high. Passive heat sinks fail
to dissipate the heat in a timely manner for these LED devices except
for exponentially increasing in size and weight. Under this circum-
stance, some liquid cooling alternatives may be appropriate.
Currently, the most widely used liquid cooling methods consti-
tute two main types, i.e. microchannel cooling and microjet cooling.

4.4.2.2.1. Microchannel cooling. Microchannel heat sinks combine
the attributes of very high surface area to volume ratio, large con-
vective heat transfer coefficient, small mass and volume, and small
coolant inventory [256,257]. These attributes render these
microchannels very suitable for cooling high-power LEDs or LED
arrays. The microchannel heat sink cooling concept was first intro-
duced by Tuckerman and Pease in the early 1980s [258]. Since this
pioneering work, microchannel heat sinks have received consider-
able attention, and several studies have since been published which
can be grouped as analytical [259–265], numerical [266,267], or ex-
perimental [268–277]. In applications, a microchannel heat sink often
operates in the cooling system which comprises a microchannel heat
sink, a micropump, a reservoir and a small heat exchanger with a
fan [278,279]. In a microchannel-based heat sink, the microchannel
structure plays a critical role in affecting the overall cooling capac-
ity of the system. The most common structure is a straight fin with
a rectangular cross-section. Zhang et al. [280] reported such a
microchannel heat sink to cool a high-power LED array. Theoreti-
cal analysis and simulation verification were conducted and the
results revealed that the minimum thermal resistance could reach
0.019 K/W. Yuan et al. [281] reported a detailed thermal analysis
of LED packaging with a microchannel cooler. They also opti-
mized the inner fin geometry inside the microchannel, flow velocity,
and total power. The simulation results showed that the
microchannel cooler reduced the average die temperature and the
staggered fins achieved better thermal performance than the straight
fins. Deng and Liu [282] proposed to use liquid metal as the coolant
rather than water to cool high power LEDs. Their experimental setup
was shown in Fig. 37. A series of experiments under different op-
erational conditions were conducted to evaluate the thermal
performance with comparisons to water. Under the same heat load,
when using the liquid metal as the coolant, the temperature rise

edge and (c) face-to-face (reprinted from Ref. 250 with permission of Elsevier).

etc. Therefore, we will not describe this here, and interested readers
are referred Section 4.4.1.

Instead, we would like to review studies on piezoelectric fans
to generate forced air cooling. Piezoelectric fans are micro-vibrating
machines used as airflow generators to help dissipate heat. They
consist of a cantilever beam bonded with a piezoelectric material
near their base ends. An input signal to the piezoelectric material
causes oscillatory motion at the free end of the beam, and the signal
could induce the surrounding flow. Acikalin et al. [249] experimen-
tally investigated the optimal design of a single piezoelectric fan
to cool LEDs. They considered different experimental configura-
tions, fan amplitude, working distance between the fan and LED,
fan length, fan frequency offset from resonance, etc. They found that
applying piezoelectric fan resulted in a temperature drop at the LED
of more than 36.4 °C. Sufian et al. [250] reported on the heat dis-
sipation ability study on LED array using piezoelectric fans by both
numerical and experimental methods. As shown in Fig. 36, two
piezoelectric fans were vertically oriented to the LED package, i.e.
edge-to-edge arrangement and face-to-face arrangement. The results
showed that the single fan enhanced the average heat transfer co-
efficient by ~1.8 times for the LED package, and the dual fans
enhanced the coefficient by ~2.3 times for edge-to-edge configu-
ration and ~2.4 times for face-to-face configuration. Ma and Li [251]
applied a dual-sided multiple fans system with a piezoelectric ac-
tuator in the thermal management of 30 W LEDs. Several parameters
were discussed, including vibrating amplitude, power input, and ar-
rangements. Ma et al. [252,253] fabricated a micro multiple
piezoelectric magnetic fan (m-MPMF) to provide an innovative
cooling solution to the thermal management of LED lighting. The
results showed that the m-MPMF system could keep the temper-
ature of a 9 W LEDs substrate below 55 °C, and a T-shape m-MPMF
could further reduce the temperature to 45.2 °C with only 0.3 W

of LED substrates was about 13 °C, which was much lower than that
based on water (about 22 °C).

In the downstream of microchannels, the temperature of the
working liquid is increased and the cooling characteristics deterio-
rated consequently. Maintaining the uniform cooling performance
of the microchannel cooling system plays an essential role in de-
creasing the thermal stress and enhancing consistent optical/
thermal performance of multiple LEDs or LED arrays. In this situation,
Luo et al. [283,284] established a compact thermal model to char-
acterize the thermal behaviors of a rectangular fractal tree-like
microchannel substrate with multiple LEDs under a target of high
temperature uniformity in LEDs. The main concept is to increase
the microchannel cross area to compensate for the decrease in heat
transfer coefficient between the working liquid and the substrate.
Thus, according to Newton’s cooling law, the cooling capability may
remain constant. They also fabricated prototypes and performed ex-
periments to validate their models. The schematic and prototype
of the rectangular fractal tree-like microchannel substrates are il-
lustrated in Fig. 38.

4.4.2.2.2. Microjet cooling. The microjet cooling method offers
a new method for heat flux management of the entire surface as
well as hot spots of the power electronics and high-power LEDs
[285,286]. Compared with the microchannel cooling system, the
microjet cooling system is composed of a microjet array device, a
micro-pump and a mini fluid container with a heat sink. In addi-
tion, the microjet is comparable with or better than microchannel
cooling for a large target plate with a proper arrangement [287].
Luo et al. [288] performed numerical and experimental analyses of
a microjet-based cooling system for the thermal management of high
power LEDs. In their study, an array of 2 × 2 LED chips, with a size
of 1 × 1 mm, was embedded in a 15 × 15 mm substrate. Their system
showed a maximum increase of 36.7 °C in the chip temperature with
an input power of 5.6W and a flow rate of 9.7 ml/s. Furthermore,
Luo and Liu [289] carried out a parametric analysis to determine
the effect of microjet diameter, top cavity height, flow rate, and the
material of the device to identify an optimal design. Based on their
optimal design, they fabricated the microjet cooling system to cool
a 220 W LED lamp. The substrate temperature of the LED chips in
the 220 W LED lamp was just 69.4 °C when the room temperature
was 30.8 °C.

5. Conclusions and perspectives

In this review, the heat and fluid flow problems in LED packag-
ing and applications were investigated. We first introduced the LED
packaging processes, from which it can be seen that LED packag-
ing comprises three aspects: (1) heat generation and dissipation;
(2) fluid flowing and molding; and (3) light extraction and control;

the latter one is dependent on the first two. To obtain a better un-
derstanding of the heat and fluid flow problems in LEDs, heat
generation was first reviewed with some solutions to confine the
heat generation. Then, the problem of phosphor gel flow was re-
viewed. Different phosphor coating methods and their developing
trends were provided. The heat flow problem was presented in detail
from three separate aspects, i.e., interface resistance, spreading re-
sistance, and component-to-ambient resistance. The causes and
corresponding solutions for these three thermal resistances were
discussed.

The main objective of this review is to provide a comprehen-
sive understanding of the heat and fluid flow problems in high-
power LED packaging and applications. In fact, heat and fluid flow
problems exist not only in LED packaging, but also in other elec-
tronic packaging. The attempt made here was to illustrate the basic
mechanism of the heat and fluid flow characteristics, so as to assist
related engineers to solve these problems fundamentally. The overall
goal was divided into the following purposes: (1) to understand the
mechanism of heat generation inside LED chips and to provide some
ways to extract more light outside of the chips and confine the heat
generation (see Section 2); (2) to summarize existing state-of-the-
art phosphor coating processes and to highlight the development
trends, which are based on a deep understanding of fluid flow be-
haviors (see Section 3); (3) to present the basic idea of controlling
the heat flow problem in LED packaging (similar to IC packaging)
from three aspects, i.e., controlling interface resistance, spreading
resistance, and the component-to-ambient resistance (see Section
4); and (4) to develop some practical solutions to solve and control
the heat flow in LEDs, so as to decrease the junction temperature
and enhance reliability (see Section 4).

These conclusions do not imply that the heat and fluid flow
problems in LEDs are totally understood or solved, but simply provide
state-of-the-art understandings and solutions to these problems.
Issues that are worth pursuing and/or exploring in the future include,
but are not limited to: (1) Better LED chips. The chips could be
modified for higher light extraction efficiency, and less heat gen-
eration by advanced manufacturing processes. (2) New packaging
materials. New packaging materials may be developed, such as the
interfacial materials, phosphors, optical components, heat spread-
ers, etc. (3) More efficient packaging structures. By developing some
new structures, both the optical and thermal performance of LEDs
may be enhanced. No matter which above issues will be broken
through, it is a must to get a full understanding of heat and fluid
flow problems in LEDs first since the LED packaging coupled with
heat and fluid flow indeed. It is hoped that this review will help
interested readers to obtain a thorough understanding of heat and
fluid flow problems and to figure out where they come from and
how to control them. It is only after we achieve this that we will
be in the position to make our own contributions to designing
