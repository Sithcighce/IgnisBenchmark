Boundary layer flashback in premixed jet flames has been the subject of detailed experimental and numerical
investigation since the 19400s. The traditional approach for characterizing flashback has involved the critical
velocity gradient concept, with higher values indicating a higher flashback propensity for a given situation.
Recent studies in confined configurations have illustrated that a key assumption underlying the critical veloc-
ity gradient concept, namely a lack of interaction between the flame and the approaching flow, is fundamen-
tally incorrect. However, for unconfined configurations, where this interaction is much less important, the
critical velocity gradient concept is able to partially capture flashback characteristics. Historically, the critical
velocity gradient concept predicts trends of flashback behavior in laminar configurations for a wide range of
temperatures, pressures, and fuel compositions more consistently than in turbulent configurations. This is
due in part to the fact that many laminar studies establish well behaved velocity conditions in the tube con-
veying the premixed reactants to the reaction zone. Yet many important practical systems are in the turbu-
lent regime and cannot be approximated by a simplified analysis. Studies to date in either regime, while
numerous, generally do not provide a comprehensive methodology for accounting for all parameters. Recent
work has attempted to capture the effect of a large number of these parameters in the turbulent regime,
with some emphasis on providing design tools that can be used to estimate flashback propensity in more
general terms. These approaches have demonstrated reasonable performance for the limited data available at
elevated temperature and pressure which are representative of important practical system such as lean pre-
mixed combustors for gas turbines. While progress has been made in the last few years relative to predicting
flashback for practical systems with high Reynolds numbers, only limited data are available for developing
and validating correlations. Open questions remain in terms of using detailed numerical simulations and
complex reaction chemistry to predict flashback for unconfined flames. In addition, flame-wall interaction in
X(vs idealized fully
terms of heat transfer, sensitivity to turbulence levels,D
developed flow), and the role of high pressure must be further evaluated.

1. Introduction

PThe combustion of fossil fuels is expected to play a key role as a
power generation source in the foreseeable future. Petroleum and
natural gas are an essential part of total power generation in many
countries worldwide. Combustion driven engines are utilized to pro-
duce the required energy consumption by residential, commercial,
and manufacturing sectors. Combustion engines, including gas tur-
bines, not only have high reliability, but also offer an excellent load
following ability [1,2]. Given the inherent advantages of gas turbines,
they have been consistently evolving to improve efficiency while
also using an increasingly variable fuel composition [1,3]. As manu-
facturers develop more robust gas turbines in terms of performance
and stability, pollutant emission remains a key concern. Environ-
mental awareness has prompted development of combustion sys-
tems with remarkably low pollutant emission levels [4,5]. To
achieve this goal, premixed combustion is implemented along with
a precise control of the temperature inside the combustor [1,3,6].
The pollutant emission of a gas turbine is significantly controlled by
decreasing temperature spatial variation and operating within the
lean combustion limit. However, operability issues including lean
blow-off, auto-ignition, flashback, and dynamic stability are chal-
lenging due to the intrinsic characteristics of premixed flames
[1,3,6]. Current gas turbines operate within a narrow range of fuel/
air ratio to avoid these aforementioned problems. As a result, the
operating range of an engine must be determined for various fuels
prior to its design and development. Experimental data, theories,
and numerical modeling can effectively contribute to evaluate the
combustion characteristics under various operating conditions.
Operability issues in an engine can cause severe damage to the
engine and the stability of the combustion system has been exten-
sively studied in past few decades to address this problem [6,7].

PIn recent years, the ability to extract natural gas using advanced
hydraulic fracturing technology has led to an abundance of this fuel
[8,9]. Natural gas is appealing due to its inherently low emissions
compared to liquid and solid fossil fuels. However, the combustion
of all fossil derived hydrocarbons generates pollutants including CO,
unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), particular matter (C), and especially
CO2, a greenhouse gas produced by complete combustion of fuel. As
a result, while natural gas is currently plentiful, near term strategies
for using fuel derived from renewable sources (e.g., alternative fuels)
must still be pursued if a reduction in carbon signature is to be
achieved [10]. Using alternative fuels is an important step providing
a realistic solution toward resolving a long term problem. For exam-
ple, the combustion of hydrogen eliminates the direct generation of

Pcarbon species. Steam reforming of natural gas is a common method
of hydrogen production [11,12] in which hydrogen-rich content
fuels can be derived and combusted in a gas turbine while allowing
management of the associated carbon [13]. In terms of coal as a fuel,
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) represents a technol-
ogy to manage CO2 emission for clean coal applications [14,15]. The
synthesis gas produced through the IGCC process contains mainly
hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the latter of which can be further
shifted to H2 and CO2 through reactions with water [13]. The cap-
tured CO2 can be transported and stored in suitable places, playing
an important role in reducing greenhouse emission and mitigating
climate change [16,17]. Hydrogen can also be produced renewably
via electrolysis of water using electricity generated by wind or pho-
tovoltaic [18]. This hydrogen can be added to the existing natural
gas infrastructure or combusted directly.

PIn light of these developments with increased consideration for
carbon management, it is apparent that fuel flexibility remains a key
consideration for gas turbine systems. It also underscores the impor-
tance of high hydrogen content fuels [19] for which the fuel/air mix-
ture preparation and subsequent combustion behavior needs to be
well understood. It is clear that syngas composition changes the
flame behavior [6]. Of particular relevance to lean premixed gas tur-
bines combustion systems is determination of how fuel composition
impacts flashback propensity.

PFlashback has been the subject of many studies in the past few
decades. This paper summarizes the major findings from research
dating to the 19400s, when a systematic experiment was developed
to investigate boundary layer flashback. Furthermore, recent prog-
ress, technical challenges, and recommendations for future studies
are discussed. Despite the fact that prediction of flashback propen-
sity is crucial to overcome the operability issues associated with gas
turbines, the lack of a comprehensive study to summarize all obser-
vations, conclusions, and theories developed in the past is still
apparent. This paper summarizes the main contributions of related
research and is organized such that the reader can locate a specific
topic and obtain an overview of previous studies.

2. Flashback mechanisms

PFlashback occurs when the flame propagates from the combus-
tion zone into the premixing section of the combustor. Flame flash-
back significantly increases the temperature inside the premixer,
which is not originally designed for this purpose. Furthermore, if
the flame anchors within the wake of existing geometric features
inside the premixer passage ways, it can cause serious damage to

domain, illustrated in Fig. 2. As the flow reversal is enhanced by the
instability process, the flame propagates upstream of the step.

2.3. Combustion induced vortex breakdown

PCIVB flashback is a prevalent mechanism in swirl stabilized gas
turbine combustors. Vortex breakdown is a unique characteristic of
swirling flows and depends on the swirl number, which describes
the relative amount of swirl strength. If the swirl number is above a
critical value, it leads to generation of vortex breakdown [34,35];
otherwise reverse flow would not occur. An increase in azimuthal
velocity relative to axial velocity causes vortex breakdown and crea-
tion of a reverse flow region. Vortex break down is an abrupt change
in the vortex structure leading to the formation of a stagnation point
and recirculation region downstream of it. In a study by Konle et al.
[36], particle image velocimetry (PIV)-laser induced fluorescence
(LIF) measurements with high temporal resolution identified the for-
mation of a closed bubble at the tip of the internal recirculation zone,
which is induced by small changes of the flow field as indicated in
Fig. 3. Positive vorticity generated by the volumetric expansion tends
to move the bubble downstream and stabilizes the flame; however,
the baroclinic torque produces negative vorticity, enhancing the
negative axial velocity and causing the upstream propagation of the
bubble [37(cid:1)40].

PA competition between the volume expansion and baroclinic
toques dictates the movement of the bubble and determines
whether fast flame propagation occurs. The position of flame
front relative to the recirculation bubble was observed to be a
critical parameter in triggering CIVB flashback [36]. A flame front
located downstream of the stagnation point provides a favorable
condition for the generation of reverse flow caused by baroclinic
torque. However, if the flame anchors upstream of the stagnation
point, the volume expansion term compensates for an increase of

Pthe engine. Flashback in gas turbine premixers can occur as a result
of at least four mechanisms [6,20,21]: (1) core flow flashback, (2)
combustion instability induced flashback, (3) combustion induced
vortex breakdown (CIVB), and (4) boundary layer flashback. Each is
briefly introduced for context.

2.1. Core flow flashback

PFlame propagation in the core flow occurs when the turbulent
burning velocity exceeds the local flow velocity in the core flow
[6,20]. The turbulent burning velocity magnitude plays the main role
in triggering the core flow flashback and is a function of turbulent-
flame interaction as well as chemical kinetics [22]. As a result, the
fuel composition and turbulence structure are essential parameters
for determining the core flow flashback limits [23,24]. A typical com-
bustor is designed to avoid core flashback by simply increasing the
axial velocity. However, common flame stabilization methods used
in practical devices may lead to core flashback. For instance, swirl
significantly decreases the local axial velocity component. In addi-
tion, flame stretching caused by the vortex-flame interaction
increases the turbulent flame speed [25(cid:1)27]. Consequently, these
two effects, higher turbulent flame speed and lower flow axial veloc-
ity, can lead to core flow flashback.

PThe key characteristic of core flashback is the turbulent burning
velocity which has been extensively studied in the literature and is
often presented as a function of laminar flame speed and turbulence
characteristics [28(cid:1)31]. Fuels with higher flame speed, such as
hydrogen, increase the potential risk of flashback compared to natu-
ral gas. Several correlations for turbulent burning velocity have
shown promise as a prediction tool for core flow flashback [22,32].
However, these correlations cannot be generally extended to various
fuels since the turbulent burning velocity is strongly dependent
upon fuel compositions [23,24]. In addition, different concepts asso-
ciated with the definition of turbulent burning velocity result in dif-
ferent values, which also contributes to inconsistency among the
existing data in the literature and challenges in interpretation [22].

2.2. Combustion instability induced flashback

PFlashback due to combustion instability occurs as a result of large
amplitude fluctuations of the flow field [6,21]. Instabilities can be
generated by the interaction of the acoustic modes, unsteady heat
release, and flow structure. Pressure and velocity oscillations associ-
ated with the instability can induce the flame movement and gener-
ate large vortices leading to the flow reversal [33], which can
potentially result in flashback. Fig. 1 indicates the instability of the
flame stabilized by backward-facing step [33]. The pulsation cycle of
the flow structure leads to the lifting of the flame from the edge of
step and eventually triggers flashback. A large eddy simulation (LES)
performed by Thibaut et al. [21] investigated the flashback induced
by the flame instability. The interactions between acoustic, turbu-
lence, and combustion were effectively captured by imposing an

the turbulent flame speed. As a result, the upstream flame prop-
agation cannot occur in the core flow region. But the flow veloc-
ity decreases close to the wall due to no-slip boundary condition
and this can be a potential route for the onset of flashback. The
burning velocity also decreases near the so called “quenching
distance” where the reaction cannot sustain itself due to heat
loss or flame stretch [44(cid:1)46]. Hence, flashback occurs at a loca-
tion where the local burning velocity is large enough to over-
come the local flow velocity near the wall. Boundary layer
flashback has been characterized by the “critical velocity gradi-
ent” concept in the literature [47]. The critical velocity gradient
corresponds to the bulk flow velocity at the condition of flash-
back and thus is an indicator of the flashback propensity of a
mixture for a given condition. Boundary layer flashback has been
studied under laminar and turbulent flow conditions for different
parameters including fuel/oxidizer composition, preheat temper-
ature, operating pressure, burner material, and geometrical
burner configuration. It is noted that the most recent research
has focused on high hydrogen content fuels as interest in the use
of low carbon fuels increases.

PWith a brief overview of known flashback mechanisms provided,
emphasis is now focused on the boundary layer mechanism which is
the primary mechanism considered in this review.

PLewis and Von Elbe first conducted a systematic experiment
and developed a prediction model for boundary layer flashback
[47]. Garside et al. carried out the first flashback experiment at
sub-atmospheric pressure [49], while Edse first studied the tur-
bulent boundary layer flashback at high pressure [56]. The effect
of preheat temperature and tip temperature were first investi-
gated by Grumer and Harris [62] and Bollinger and Edse [66],
respectively. The first numerical study was conducted by Lee and
Xien [86] for propagation of a premixed laminar flame through a
T’D
tube.

in order to propagate
upstream; otherwise, the flame remains stable. For the former
case, the bubble propagates upstream under special circumstan-
ces and moves the flame front into the premixing zone, which
can then lead to flashback.

PA number of experimental studies investigated the effects of
syngas compositions on CIVB flashback. Various fuel composi-
tions, representing actual syngas mixtures [42] have been con-
sidered, and the results indicate that fuels with higher hydrogen
concentration tends to have higher propensity for flashback via
the CIVB mechanism. In general, for swirl stabilized systems, it is
noted that (1) flashback characteristics depends on the swirl
number and (2) multiple flashback mechanisms may result
depending on swirl strength which creates some challenges in
interpreting flashback for these systems. Some work has also
been directed at this issue by varying the swirl number and indi-
cated that the upstream flame propagation speed was signifi-
cantly different based on flashback mechanisms [43].

3.1. Simple model for boundary layer flashback prediction

PThis is based on the assumption that the flow velocity remains linear
close to the wall.

PThe critical velocity gradient model neglects the flame-flow
interaction and assumes that the flow velocity remains undisturbed.
Fig. 5 indicates the flame front stabilized inside a burner close to the
wall. The velocity profile of the unburned mixture u(y) represents a
laminar flow approaching the flame front. The flame speed denoted
by Sf(y) decreases close to the wall due to the heat loss and quench-
ing of radicals. The flame is quenched at a certain distance from the
wall and part of the flame close to the wall trails behind the central
position as indicated in Fig. 5 [47,48,63]. The quenching distance in
Fig. 5 is denoted by dq. The velocity gradient g at the wall in Eq. (1)
is used to describe the flashback, in which tw is the shear stress and
mu is the viscosity of the unburned mixture.

PBased on this theory, flashback occurs when the flow velocity
drops below the burning velocity somewhere in the flow field close
to the wall. The location at which the burning velocity is equal to the
flow velocity is defined as the penetration distance dp [113], indi-
cated in Fig. 5. The magnitude of the flow bulk velocity at the onset
of flashback corresponds to the critical velocity gradient at the wall,
gc. Hence, the flame does not propagate as long as the velocity gradi-
ent is higher than this critical value (i.e. gc).

PTo explain this concept in more detail, a tube burner is consid-
ered in which the flame stabilizes downstream of the burner rim.
Fig. 6 represents several flow conditions relative to the propagation
of the flame into the tube [47]. The burning velocity is zero within
the quenching distance and it gradually increases to its constant nor-
laminar flame
mal value corresponding to the one-dimensional
speed. Both quenching and penetration distances are indicated in
Fig. 6. Line (2) indicates the critical velocity gradient condition at
which flashback is possible. As the flow velocity is decreased (line
(1)), the flame flashes back and propagates upstream. However, if
the flow velocity is further increased than the critical value (line
(2)), the flame is swept out of the tube.

PThe velocity gradient at the wall is approximated by the ratio of
the flow velocity to the penetration distance as follows in Eq. (2).

PThe flow velocity at the penetration distance is equal to the burn-
ing velocity at the critical condition. Furthermore, the burning veloc-
ity magnitude at the penetration distance is assumed to be close to
its normal value and can thus be approximated by the laminar flame
speed SL [47]. The laminar flame speed is calculated based on the
one-dimensional steady flow assumption. With these simplifica-
tions, Eq. (2) reduces to:

in which r is radial distance and U is the bulk flow velocity. Combin-

PThe critical velocity gradient concept has been frequently used in
the literature to characterize boundary layer flashback. It was used
as a means to evaluate flashback propensity of a given fuel at differ-
ent operating conditions. Regarding fuel composition impacts, it is
evident that the influence of fuel composition on laminar flame
speed and penetration distance can capture the effects.

PWhile Eq. (3) was originally proposed to predict the flashback
propensity of laminar flames [47], the concept was extended to tur-
bulent conditions. For fully developed turbulent flow in a pipe
upstream of location which the flame stabilizes, the velocity gradi-
ent is estimated from the Blasius correlations for smooth pipes with
the diameter of D at a given Reynolds number Re [114]:

in which f and n are friction factor and kinematic viscosity, respec-
tively. Eq. (3) and Eq. (8) are used together to determine the flash-
back propensity of turbulent flames [63].

PThe only parameter not fully described in this simple analysis is
the penetration distance for a specific fuel or distance from the wall
at which the flow velocity is equal to the burning velocity. Indeed,
the penetration distance in Eq. (3) needs to be determined in order
to predict flashback propensity of different fuel compositions.
The overall variation of penetration distance is considered to be
proportional to the quenching distance, as frequently reported in
the literature [48,51,61,69,76,82,85]. Flame quenching near the wall
can be categorized into three situations: (1) quenching between two
parallel plates or inside a tube, (2) head-on quenching, and (3) side-
wall quenching. The first quenching type is defined as a minimum
distance between two parallel plates (or minimum tube diameter) at
which the flame can propagate through the channel (or tube). Many
experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the rela-
tion between the passage characteristic dimension as a function of
fuel variation, equivalence ratio, pressure, wall temperature, and
X. It is difficult to isolate the effect of one variable since

Pall parameters are coupled and cannot be changed independently.
Nevertheless, different studies have tried to address this problem
by investigating various parameters [44,115(cid:1)117] and finding
empirical relations [118(cid:1)121].

PThe measurement of quenching distance for a single wall is more
complicated. Head-on quenching is defined as the flame propagates
perpendicular to the wall (studied in [122(cid:1)125]) as indicated in
Fig. 7, while for sidewall quenching, the flame propagates parallel

flame propagates upstream along the wall in which the sidewall
quenching plays an important role. However, it is noted that the
quenching distance between two parallel plates (or inside a tube)
has been used in the literature to characterize boundary layer
flashback [48,51,69,76,85].

PThe critical velocity gradient model originally developed neglects
flame-flow interaction which is a significant simplification. As sug-
gested in Fig. 6, the flow velocity profile at the onset of flashback
was assumed to not be influenced by the flame. In addition, the
burning velocity profile is assumed to only be affected by the wall
and consideration of quenching distance. Yet this approach has been
widely implemented in the literature and has proven capable of
correlating the experimental data for laminar and certain types of
turbulent flames, as will be shown in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

3.2. Underlying physics of boundary layer flashback

PMore recent experimental and numerical simulations reveal that
the flame-flow interaction near the wall can have a significant effect
on flow velocity distribution for both laminar and turbulent flows at
the onset of flashback [99,100,106,108]. In practical devices, the pre-
mixed fuel/air mixture is injected into the combustor by the burner
premixer. At normal operating conditions, the flame stabilizes past
the burner rim due to the sudden expansion as the flow is injected
from the burner into the combustion chamber. The schematic of the
stable flame front is shown in Fig. 8(a). When the boundary layer
flashback limit is reached, the flame propagates upstream into pre-
mixed reactants, indicated in Fig. 8(b).

PAs a result, it is apparent that two regimes must be considered for
physical interpretation and modeling. The first is the regime prior to
transition of the stabilized flame at the burner rim into the injector.
This regime is labeled as an “unconfined flame” situation. Once the
flame enters the premixer/injector and propagates upstream along
the wall, the underlying physics of the problem are different. This
second regime is labeled as a “confined flame” throughout the
paper.

PUntil the transition of the unconfined flame from the burner rim
into the premixer tube, the flame does not strongly affect the veloc-
ity distribution of the incoming flow and the flow velocity profile
upstream of the flame front remains approximately undisturbed as
experimentally observed and discussed in [106]. This is the main
reason why the critical velocity gradient concept originally con-
ceived was able to characterize boundary layer flashback propensity,
especially under laminar conditions.

PHowever, once the flame propagates into the burner (confined
flames), the basic assumption of the critical velocity gradient

Fig. 7. Flame-wall interaction: (a) head-on quenching and (b) sidewall quenching.

Fig. 8. Flame configuration: (a) unconfined flame stabilized downstream of the pre-
mixer tube and (b) confined flame stabilized in a tube [94].

Pconcept is not valid [99,100]. The flow-flame interaction near the
wall-region for confined flames cannot be neglected. The flame is
strongly curved towards the unburned mixture as flame propagates
upstream leading to a divergence of streamlines and adverse pres-
sure gradient. When the gas expansion is large enough relative to
the local flow velocity near the wall, it can cause the boundary layer
separation as discussed in more detail in Section 5.4.

3.3. Parameters impacting boundary layer flashback

PMany parameters impact flashback propensity; as a result, isolat-
ing the effect of a specific variable is difficult. In general, all parame-
ters can be categorized into the following groups:

P(cid:3) Flow and D
P(cid:3) Operating D
P(cid:3) Flame D

Xcombustion D
Xconditions
Xconfiguration and D

Xcharacteristics

Xboundary D

Xlayer D

Xheating

PHow each impacts flashback propensity is discussed in the

sections below.

P3.3.1. Flow and combustion characteristics

PThe flow bulk velocity directly impacts boundary layer flashback
by changing the streamwise momentum near the wall-region. As
the mean flow velocity increases, the local flame speed must
increase in order to propagate upstream. Hence, flashback propen-
sity occurs at fuel/air ratios nearer to those associated with the high-
est flame speed as the bulk flow velocity increases. Furthermore, the
velocity profile of the incoming flow, where the flame stabilizes,
affects the flashback limits. For instance, it was noted experimentally
that when the incoming flow is not fully developed, the flashback
propensity decreases due to the higher wall shear stress, which is a
function of entrance length [83].

PThe boundary layer flashback limit is quite different under
laminar and turbulent boundary conditions. The flame-wall inter-
action is more complex under turbulent conditions [127,128].
Depending on the turbulent Reynolds number, the turbulent com-
bustion regime dictates the flame structure and defines how the

Psmall scale eddies interact with the flame [129,130]. Hence, the
turbulent flame speed is also a function of turbulence intensity
and consequently higher turbulence intensity results in higher
flashback propensity [22].

PCombustion characteristics of premixed flames are dependent
upon the fuel composition. The mixture burning velocity plays a key
role in triggering the flashback and is largely a function of chemical
kinetic mechanisms. Furthermore, the thermal and radical quench-
ing by the wall varies significantly with different fuel compositions
which, in turn, leads to different flashback limits [48,57,65,69]. The
high flashback propensity of hydrogen mixtures is a result of high
burning velocity and small quenching distance. The flame propaga-
tion is enhanced for low Lewis number premixed flames as verified
for various fuel compositions by experimental and numerical studies
[131(cid:1)136].

P3.3.2. Operating conditions

PPressure and preheat temperature are two important factors
in boundary layer flashback. An increase in preheat temperature
increases the burning velocity significantly [137]. Consequently,
boundary layer flashback propensity increases for higher preheat
in Section 4.3
temperatures, which will be discussed in detail
and 5.3.

PBoundary layer flashback experiments at high pressure are espe-
cially germane to gas turbine applications. Conclusions and results
drawn from atmospheric pressure tests must be further verified at
high pressure prior to any general conclusion for systems operated
at elevated pressure. It is noted that the effect of sub-atmospheric
pressures on flashback has been studied [67,70,76], but these
results cannot be extended to elevated pressures as will be dis-
cussed in Section 5.3.

P3.3.3. Flame configuration and boundary layer heating

PExperimental results have indicated that the flame-flow interac-
tion near the wall-region cannot be neglected for flames propagating
through a channel (confined flames) [99,100]. As will be discussed in
Section 5.4.1, confined flames are more prone to flashback and the
flame-wall interaction for confined flames has received considerable
attention in recent years in both experimental and numerical model-
ing studies. When the flame propagates upstream in the confined
configuration, the flame leading edge is convex towards the reac-
tants, enhancing the flame stretch effect and causing the approach
flow to decelerate.

PBurner heads constructed from different materials show varying
flashback propensity [66,98,103,104]. The effect of thermal coupling
between the burner head and flame on flashback propensity has been
found to be an important parameter. A qualitative relationship has
been observed between flashback and the variables involved in the
construction and operation of the burners [66,98,103,104]. The flame
temperature and product species also vary with fuel composition, in
turn influencing the heat transfer between the burner rim and flame
front (see Fig. 8(a)). This can cause the burner tip temperature to
change depending on the fuel compositions for a given equivalence
ratio. The heat is conducted upstream along the burner, causing the
heat addition from the wall into the incoming reactants. The bound-
ary layer heating leads to a point of inflection in the velocity profile,
which can induce flow separation. As a result, flashback propensity is
more pronounced for uncooled burners. Unsteady transitions in oper-
ating conditions (e.g. a sudden drop in reactant flow rates) can also
trigger boundary layer flashback [138]. It is also noted that the flame,
which does not initially flash back at a given condition, can eventually
flash back after long periods of operation due to small perturbations
which may lead to an increase in the premixer wall temperature.

PUsing an enclosure about an unconfined flame can also
change the flashback propensity limits due to resulting recircula-
tion regions in the sudden expansion region and change in

Pthe local heat transfer characteristics which will be explained in
Section 5.2 [98,104].

4. Laminar flames

PDetermination of limits for boundary layer flashback of laminar
flames received much attention in the early literature. Different
basic models and correlations,
including Lewis and von Elbe's
critical velocity concept, were developed in order to characterize the
flashback propensity. These prediction models were used to com-
pare the experimental results with various fuel compositions, pre-
the
heat
sensitivity of flashback limit to the burner diameter, ranging from
quenching limit to large values, was evaluated for different fuel/oxi-
dizer mixtures. Numerical simulations of laminar flame provided
more detail regarding the flame-flow interaction and have been
used to reproduce the flashback limits obtained from experimental
results. The detailed discussion is presented in following sections.

temperatures, and operating pressures.

In addition,

4.1. Prediction models

PAs mentioned previously, Lewis and Von Elbe [47] developed the
critical velocity gradient model to predict the flashback propensity
of jet flames. The penetration distance of the flame near the wall cal-
culated from Eq. (3) was found to be about the half of quenching dis-
tance of a flame through plane parallel plates and predicted to be
one-third of quenching distance for cylindrical tubes. This concept
was further developed by using non-dimensional parameters. Put-
nam et al. used Peclet numbers to present the critical velocity gradi-
ent model in non-dimensional form [52]. Peclet number represents
the balance between the characteristic time scales of the flow and
chemical reaction [52,139,140]. Based on this approach, flow and
flame Peclet numbers are defined for a tube diameter of D in Eq. (9)
and Eq. (10):

where a is thermal diffusivity and U is the flow bulk velocity. In this
model, the penetration distance (dp) is considered to be a multiple of
the laminar flame thickness calculated from one-dimensional steady
analysis as follows [141]:

in which K is an arbitrary constant. Substituting Eq. (11) in Eq. (5)
and using D for the burner diameter, this equation is written as:

equation can be simplified to the non-dimensional form [52]:

PThis approach assumes a linear velocity profile near the wall. Fur-
thermore, the burning velocity is assumed to be equal to the one-
dimensional laminar flame speed, which is not affected by the
quenching in the vicinity of the tube wall. These assumptions were
relaxed to improve the prediction model developed in [52]. Indeed,
the penetration distance dp at which the flow velocity equals the
flame speed is an unknown parameter and must be determined.
Fig. 9 illustrates the flow and flame velocity profiles at the onset of
flashback. Parameter e denotes the distance from the wall at which
the burning velocity starts falling as a parabolic curve to zero value

Fig. 10. Peclet number non-dimensional analysis for boundary layer flashback, repro-
duced from [52].

PThe Peclet number analysis can predict the limited data for the
laminar flame stabilized beyond a tube burner exit. However, signifi-
cant deviation is observed at small Peclet numbersD
X in Fig. 10. The
authors mention several effects as the main reasons for the observed
deviation [52]. Namely that the equations derived do not take into
account the difference between one-dimensional and two-dimen-
sional heat transfer from the flame, the change in the flame front,
and the change of the flow direction at the flame front. Furthermore,
the quenching distance is dependent on the tube size and increases
as the tube size decreases. A group of data at high Peclet numbers
also deviates from the trend line in Fig. 10 and this was associated
with turbulent effects previously identified by von Elbe and Menster
[48].

PBased on the conclusion made by Wohl et al. [61] who state that
the penetration distance is proportional to flame thickness and
quenching distance, Berlad et al. presented the critical velocity gra-
dient model as a function of the quenching distance as follows [69]:

PThe penetration distance used by Von Elbe and Mentser [48] is
about the half of the quenching distance for flame quenching
between parallel plates. Assuming the quenching distance of circular
tube is about 1.5 times that of parallel plates, the constant C should
be 3 from Von Elbe and Mentser [48]. The application of Eq. (21) was
further examined using a wide variety of published experimental
data for various fuels [44,47,48,60,61,63,142]. Fig. 11 presents the
variation of critical velocity gradient versus the ratio of laminar
flame speed to the quenching distance for various fuels at different
pressures, preheat temperatures, and equivalence ratios. Based on
this study, the value of C is not constant and increases from 2.5 to
5 as gc increases from 10 to 105 1/s. Hence, the constant C can be rep-
resented as function of gc itself, resulting in a power law variation
suggested in [51] (Eq. (22)). This correlation is indicated by the solid

Plaminar flows, the critical velocity gradient is small compared to
Xturbulent flows.

PSection 4.1 has summarized the key basic models developed for
boundary layer flashback of laminar premixed flames. The main
underlying assumption of predictive models is that the flame and
flow do not interact. As a result, the laminar velocity profile is pre-
sumed to remain undisturbed at onset of flashback and is therefore
known from the analytical solution of fully developed laminar flows
in a circular tube or two-dimensional channel. In addition, flame
characteristics are described by one-dimensional flame propagation
theory. By combining the premixed flame and flow characteristics,
the critical condition at which flashback occurs is obtained.

4.2. Effect of burner diameter and temperature

PIn their original work, Lewis and Von Elbe also investigated the
effect of burner diameter on flashback behavior of fully developed
laminar flows of natural gas air mixtures [47]. The tube burner was
constructed from Pyrex with inner diameters varying from 0.315 to
1.55 cm. Between each test the burner was cooled down to the room
temperature as the cooling effect was found an important parameter
for obtaining consistent data. The inner surface of the Pyrex burner
was also coated with various salts and metals to examine the effect
of the surface material inside the tube. Because the heat conductivity
of the burner is several times larger than that of a gas, the overall
heat loss to the atmosphere is determined by the gas conductivity,
not that of the burner. Hence, it was concluded that the wall temper-
ature (up to 100 °C) had little effect on flashback propensity [47].
This is in good agreement with the study by Miller and Setzer [74],
who concluded that the effect of premixer wall temperature is negli-
gible below 115 °C. They did note that higher tip temperatures cause
a strong effect on flashback limits. The effect of burner material on
the tip temperature is discussed in more detail in Section 5.2.

PFig. 12 presents the critical flow rates at which flashback occurs as
a function of the mixture composition for burner diameters from
0.333 to 1.55 cm. The dashed curve shows the data at the beginning
of the flame upstream propagation and the solid curve indicates “full
flashback.” The data between these two curves (solid points) repre-
sents situations in which the flame cone was partially drawn into the
tube. It was concluded that this resulted from some local high tem-
perature regions on the burner rim due to “some irregularity” that
was not further defined or discussed. The partially propagated flame
increases the pressure inside the tube and causes a deflection of the
streamlines in the opposite direction. The flame at this condition was
described as a “tilted flame” in which the dynamic symmetry of the
flame was destroyed. The flame can propagate upstream unless the
flame is quenched because of the tube cooling. The velocity gradient
in this region, where the flame propagates into the burner, decreases
due to the streamline distortion and consequently the flame flashes
back below the critical flashback value. The velocity gradient of lami-
nar flow in Eq. (5) was modified for tilted flames in [47] and later
used by Grumer for predicting turbulent flashback limits [77].

PThe flow velocity at which flashback occurs increases with an
increase in the burner diameter. Indeed, for a given volumetric air
flow rate, the flow bulk velocity decreases with square of the diame-
ter resulting in lower equivalence ratio or fuel percent. The points at
zero flow rate show the inflammability limit of natural gas for
upstream propagation.

PThe variation of critical velocity gradient calculated from Eq. (5)
is illustrated in Fig. 13 as a function of natural gas concentration in
air. The critical velocity gradient can correlate the effect of D
Xburner
diameter for the diameter range studied. However, some discrep-
ancy for the burner diameter of 1.55 cm is observed near stoichio-
metric conditions. This might be due to D
Xincipient turbulence at these
conditions causing an increase in the burning velocity [47]. The
flame propagation is fully arrested for the limiting diameter for

by Wohl [61]. The dependency of critical velocity gradient on pres-
sure was determined from the original model developed in [47,48].

causes a decrease in burning velocity and flame thickness, while

sional parameter in numerical modeling of the laminar boundary
layer flashback [90,94]. This non-dimensional group has been used
in the literature to characterize flashback propensity of laminar as
well as turbulent flames [90,94,110,138].

P0.315 cm. It is also observed that the burners with small diameters
close to this value (0.333 and 0.389 cm) do not follow the general
trend. This was explained by the fact that the flow velocity profile
within the wall and the penetration distance for small burner
diameters is not linear.

PFig. 14 presents another view of the effect of the burner diameter
on flashback propensity at a lean condition (7.5% natural gas) [47].
At sufficiently large diameter, the critical velocity gradient remains
approximately constant. The lack of diameter dependence was also
observed by Kurz [73] for laminar flames for various hydrocarbon air
mixtures shielded with inert gases of helium and nitrogen. However,
the ratio of penetration distance to the burner diameter increases as
the burner diameter decreases and finally reaches a point at which
this value is no longer small enough to apply one of underlying

Passumptions made for the critical velocity gradient concept. An
underlying assumption of the critical velocity gradient concept is
based on estimating the flow velocity at the penetration distance by
the tangent to the velocity profile at the wall. This assumption is not
valid when the penetration distance is comparable to the burner
diameter; hence, the effect of the velocity profile curvature should
be considered. With further decrease in burner diameter, the lami-
nar burning velocity across the exit is entirely affected by the
quenching distance. For burner diameters less than 0.389 cm in
Fig. 14, the burning velocity is reduced, even at the burner axis, lead-
ing to a sudden decrease of critical velocity gradient. The flame is
eventually quenched by the smallest diameter as indicated in Fig. 14.
PThe qualitative effect of the burner diameter on critical velocity
gradient shown in Fig. 13 depends on the fuel concentration. For
instance, the critical velocity gradient slightly increases with an
increase in burner diameter at rich conditions. Hence, a general con-
clusion for variation of the critical velocity gradient with the burner
diameter cannot be made regardless of the fuel percentage in the
mixture. Furthermore, observations obtained from different studies
are not entirely consistent. Fig. 15 shows the flashback propensity
of methane/air mixtures for two burner diameters at atmospheric
pressure and room temperature [93]. The critical velocity gradient
decreases with an increase in burner diameter at rich conditions.
The burner tip temperature in the experiment [93] was not con-
trolled during each test and values were not reported. This may be

Pwere used interchangeably. The burner tube was cooled frequently
between tests to avoid an increase in the temperature. Fig. 16 indi-
cates the variation of critical velocity gradient with the methane
concentration in nitrogen/oxygen mixtures at burner diameters
ranging from 1.397 to 18.07 mm. The burner diameter range was
selected such that the Reynolds number remained less than 2000 for
all cases. For methane/air reaction (labeled by the ratio of 0.21 in
Fig. 16), results of different burner diameters match well with the
general trend line. However, when the burner diameter is compara-
ble to the flame quenching distances, the deviation is pronounced as
seen from the top curve in Fig. 16. An increase of oxygen in the mix-
ture does not change the dependency of the critical velocity gradient
on burner diameter.

PFig. 17 illustrates the variation of critical velocity gradient for
propane/oxygen-nitrogen mixtures with different burner diameters.
The propane/air mixture is not significantly influenced by changing
the burner diameter. However, when the diameter decreases to a
sufficiently small value, the quenching effect becomes more impor-
tant. As discussed relative to Fig. 13, for small diameters, the physical
assumption of the linear velocity profile close to the wall used in the
critical velocity gradient concept is not valid. A significant deviation
from the solid curve (shown by diamond and cross shapes) is
observed for propane/oxygen mixture in Fig. 17. The effect of dilu-
tion at the burner rim for fuel rich mixtures becomes more impor-
tant as oxidizer other than air is used.

PA more recent experiment studied the effect of burner diameter
on laminar flashback of H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO and H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4 mixtures with
variation of hydrogen from 5% to 25% in both mixtures [96].
Fig. 18(a) indicates the variation of the critical velocity gradient of
25% H2(cid:1)75% CO mixture at three different burner diameters, i.e. 6, 7,
and 10.6 mm. In this study, the effect of burner diameter is negligible
at lean conditions and becomes more pronounced as the equivalence
ratio increases. Furthermore, the largest diameter in Fig. 18(a) has
the lowest critical velocity gradient for fuel rich mixtures. This
observation was not reported by Lewis and Elbe [47] for methane/
air mixtures and may be due to the thermal coupling effect between
the burner head and flame.

PThe effect of burner diameter observed by Dam et al. on flashback
propensity of 25% H2(cid:1)75% CH4 mixture is also illustrated in
Fig. 18(b). The effect of diameter is pronounced at lean condition. In
addition, the 7 mm burner tube has the lowest critical velocity

PIn other work from von Elbe's group, the flashback limit of meth-
ane and propane with the mixture of oxygen and nitrogen was
determined for laminar flames at atmospheric pressure and room
temperature [51]. The flow was fully developed and the fuel/air mix-
ture was injected through a Pyrex tube unless a constraint due to
the flame temperature occurred. Near stoichiometric conditions for
cases with oxygen used as an oxidizer, quartz, porcelain or copper

Pgradient. It is noted that the addition of 25% H2 to the carbon monox-
ide or methane (Fig. 18(a) and (b)) does not show the similar behav-
ior. The methane mixture is less affected by the hydrogen addition
for fuel rich mixtures. The results suggest that the heat transfer to
the burner rim and the quenching distance are complicated func-
tions of fuel composition and influenced by the burner diameter at
small diameters. The description of such a different characteristic is
described in Section 4.4. It appears that no general conclusion can
be made regarding the variation of critical velocity gradient with
diameter according to the study by Dam et al. [96].

PEarly studies concluded that the critical velocity gradient is inde-
pendent of burner diameter for sufficiently large values. However, it
is noted that the effect of burner diameter cannot simply be
extended to all equivalence ratio ranges and various fuel composi-
tions. The size of the burner has an important effect on heat transfer
between the burner rim and flame front. The complicated heat bal-
ance at the burner rim including convection of the gas flow mixture,
radiation of products, and conduction of the burner material cannot
be predicted by the simple critical velocity gradient model. Conse-
quently, the variation of the burner diameter impacts differently on
flashback limits for various fuel/air compositions. Furthermore, the
heat balance between the burner rim and flame front is significantly
affected by the equivalence ratio, determining the temperature of
the stabilized flame. This is the main reason why experiments exam-
ining different fuel compositions do not show consistent results. In
order to isolate the effect of the burner diameter, the burner tip tem-
perature needs to be monitored or controlled carefully. A small dis-
turbance in flame front shape such as tilted flame can significantly
change the tip temperature resulting in a different flashback limit.
The size of burner (at sufficiently large values) does not significantly
influence the flashback limits in terms of critical velocity gradient if
the burner is cooled during the experiment and flashback is gradu-
ally approached such that the burner rim temperature remains at
quasi-steady heat balance. However, this behavior changes when
the quenching distance is comparable to the burner with small
diameters.

4.3. Effect of preheat temperature and operating pressure

PDugger studied the effect of preheat temperature on flashback
propensity of propane/air flames under laminar conditions [63]. The
temperature of the reactants was varied from 300 to 620 K. The
burner tube was constructed from brass with an inner diameter of
1.56 cm. The tube wall temperature was controlled such that it

Papproximately remained constant at the temperature of the reac-
tants. The Reynolds number values were less than 2000. Fig. 19
presents the variation of critical velocity gradient with equivalence
ratio at four different preheat temperatures of 306, 422, 506, and
617 K and illustrates that the critical velocity gradient increases with
an increase in the preheat temperature. The laminar flame speed
increases with temperature raised to an exponent which is a func-
tion of fuel composition [145(cid:1)147]. Furthermore, the quenching dis-
tance decreases as the preheat temperature increases [44] and this
effect is more pronounced in the experiment of Dugger [44] since
the burner wall temperature was controlled to be the same as the
preheat temperature.

PTo isolate the effect of laminar flame speed on flashback propen-
sity, laminar propane/air mixture burning velocities are calculated
from Eq. (28) as proposed by Metghalchi and Keck [145]. This
expression is valid in the pressure range from 0.4 to 40 atm:

in which Tu0 D 298 K and P0 D 1 atm. SL0, a, and b are fitted constants
presented in Table 1 [145]. Assuming an equivalence ratio of 1.2 in
Fig. 19, critical velocity gradients at four preheat temperatures are
gc0 D 640, 1.79gc0, 2.426gc0 and 4.87gc0, respectively. Using Eq. (3) (in
which gc/SL) and the laminar flame speed in Eq. (28), critical velocity
gradient values can be calculated with respect to the reference
preheat temperature of T0 D 306 K and the reference critical velocity
gradient of gc0 D 640.

PBased on Eq. (29), the critical velocity gradients at three preheat
temperatures of 422, 506, and 617 K are 1.91gc0, 2.76gc0 and 4.12gc0,
respectively. These predicted values at 422 and 506 K preheat tem-
peratures are higher than the actual values obtained from measure-
ments, while the predicted value at 617 K is lower. Consequently,
the effect of preheat temperature on laminar burning velocity alone
does not account for an increase in critical velocity gradient as its
impact on quenching distance must also be accounted for.

Fig. 19. Effect of preheat temperature on flashback propensity of propane/air mix-
ture, reproduced from [63].

PA similar approach was used by Khitrin et al. [82] to study flash-
back propensity of methane/oxygen and methane/air mixtures with
the preheat temperature varied from 20 to 400 °C. The study was
conducted for quartz and metal tube burners with different diame-
ters ranging from 18 to 25 mm. The temperature of the burner rim
was maintained at the mixture preheat temperature to within 10 °C.
Fig. 20 illustrates the variation of the critical velocity gradient
with equivalence ratio at five preheat temperatures. The slope of
the critical velocity gradient is a function of equivalence ratio and
exhibits more sensitivity as preheat increases.

PThe measured data from Khitrin [82] are plotted in Fig. 21 using
the Peclet number (Eq. (13)) as a non-dimensional parameter. The
solid line shows the variation of Peflow D 0.01(Peflame )2, in which
the constant differs from the dashed line suggested by Putnam
and Jensen [52] representing Peflow D 0.0125(Peflame )2. Nevertheless,
good agreement between the data obtained from various preheat
temperatures and the correlations developed in previous studies is

Pnoted. This illustrates that the critical velocity gradient model is able
to predict the preheat temperature effects. The difference between
these two constants (i.e. 0.01 and 0.0125) may be due to the laminar
flame speed measurement and its calibration.

PThe effect of preheat temperatures on flashback limit of meth-
ane/air mixtures was studied by Grumer and Harris [62] for sharp-
edged short ports, which are common in gas appliances. Fig. 22
shows the variation of critical velocity gradient as a function of pre-
heat temperature for mixtures with given fractions of stoichiometric
F (i.e. the fuel percentage divided by the stoichiometric fuel percent-
age). The velocity profile for this burner was not fully developed and
the critical velocity gradient was determined using an experimen-
tally derived equation from [59,148]. It is noted that the variation
of critical velocity gradient with preheat temperature shown in
Fig. 22 is better captured by exponential function rather than power
law relation, which is generally used for laminar burning velocity
correlations.

PFine conducted boundary layer flashback experiments for hydro-
gen/air mixtures at sub-atmospheric pressures varied from 0.15 to
1 atm [67,71]. The original model by Lewis and Von Elbe [47] was
modified to take into account the effect of pressure. Flames were sta-
bilized at the burner rim using burners with diameters of 0.546,
1.016, and 1.459 cm. The flow was fully developed at the exit section.
The tip temperature was noted as a contributor to flashback and was
thus controlled by water cooling to eliminate its effect. The pressure
was increased slowly to approach flashback at constant mass flow
rate and preheat temperature. The burning velocity was measured
by determining the total flame area from Schlieren images. The
equivalence ratio was varied from 0.8 to 2.25. These tests were
mainly obtained for rich conditions due to the high uncertainty at
lower mass flow rates and characteristic of hydrogen flames.

PFig. 23 shows the variation of the critical velocity gradient with
pressure at equivalence ratio of 1.8 for three burner diameters stud-
ied by Fine [67,71]. The critical velocity gradient increases as the
ambient pressure increases, resulting in higher flashback propensity.

effect.

PFine [67,71] also measured burning velocity as a function of pres-
sure at different equivalence ratios and a similar relation to Eq. (30)
was suggested:

SL / Pnu

ð31Þ
Pnu varied between 0.208 and 0.256 for the equivalence ratio
between 1.1 (cid:2) fD
X (cid:2) 1.9. This correlation suggests that the laminar
burning velocity increases with an increase in pressure. This is con-
sistent with other studies of the burning velocity of hydrogen/air
flames at sub-atmospheric pressure in the literature. For example,
Fig. 24 illustrates the variation of laminar flame speed with pressure
at different hydrogen concentrations [149]. For equivalence ratios
D 0:25), the reaction order is less than 2 and a
less than 0.79 (XH2
negative pressure dependence is observed, while for equivalence
ratio higher than 0.79, the reaction order is larger than 2 with posi-
tive pressure dependence. This indicates that the laminar flame
speed increases with an increase of sub-atmospheric pressure at fuel
rich conditions [149] consistent with the positive exponents pro-
posed by Fine for Eq. (31).

PBased on equations Eq. (30), Eq. (31) and using Eq. (3), the varia-

tion of the quenching distance with pressure would be:

dq / Pnq
ð32Þ
in which nq is equal to nu ¡ nf. Considering the average values for
pressure exponents of critical velocity gradient and laminar flame
speed, nq D ¡1.12 was suggested [67,71]. The comparison of the
pressure exponent of quenching distance (nq D ¡1.12) to the experi-
mental results of Drell and Belles [75] for parallel plates indicates
good agreement as illustrated in Fig. 25. Drell and Belles reported
pressure exponents of 1.051, 1.138, and 1.097 for the quenching dis-
tance between two parallel plates at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1, and
2, respectively [75].

PThe variation of critical velocity gradient with equivalence ratio
at different pressures found by Fine is indicated in Fig. 26 [67,71].
The slope of the critical velocity gradient variation increases with an
increase in pressure. This indicates that the flashback propensity is
more sensitive to equivalence ratio variation at higher pressures.
A general correlation was found to fit all the measured data of
hydrogen/air flames at reduced pressures:

coefficient in Eq. (33) was found to be 3 from the study by Von Elbe
at al. [48].

PFurther work by Fine [70] investigated the effect of pressure
on flashback propensity of hydrogen/oxygen-argon and hydrogen/
oxygen-helium in which the concentrations of oxygen, argon, and
helium were 20.6, 79.4, and 79.4, respectively. The experiment setup
was similar to that used in previous studies [67,71]. The equivalence
ratio was varied in the range of 0.9 (cid:2) f (cid:2) 2.25 for the hydrogen/oxy-
gen-argon mixtures and 1.1 (cid:2) f (cid:2) 1.5 for the hydrogen/oxygen-
helium mixtures. The burner head diameter used in this experiment
was 0.546 and 1.016 cm. Fig. 27 presents the variation of critical
velocity gradient as a function of pressure for hydrogen/oxygen-
Xargon and hydrogen/oxygen-helium. The flashback data of argon
diluted mixture are in a good agreement with results for helium
diluted mixture. The pressure exponents of critical velocity gradients
for hydrogen/oxygen-argon mixtures are 1.59 and 1.49 at equiva-
lence ratios of 1.1 and 1.5 respectively. The exponent values are 1.50
and 1.48 for the hydrogen/oxygen-helium mixtures at these same
equivalence ratios, respectively, which are slightly different com-
pared to the hydrogen/oxygen-argon mixtures. The average pressure

flames at different pressures, top curve (atmospheric data from [48]), reproduced

Pexponent for equivalence ratios between 0.9 (cid:2) f (cid:2) 2.25 was 1.51 for
both argon and helium diluted mixtures.

PThe burning velocity of the mixture diluted by helium is much
larger than the burning velocity of the hydrogen/oxygen-argon mix-
tures [70,150]. This suggests that the quenching distance of the
helium diluted mixture increases in a manner that the critical veloc-
ity gradient remains approximately constant. This is consistent with
the observation that the flame for the hydrogen/oxygen-helium mix-
ture anchored at a larger distance from the burner rim [70]. Further-
more, results for two burner diameters follow the same trend line as
indicated in Fig. 27, except at richest condition with equivalence
ratio of 2.25 (see Fig. 28). For the 1.016 cm diameter tube, a transi-
tion from laminar to turbulent flow for the hydrogen/oxygen-argon
mixture occurs at critical velocity gradient about 8000 resulting in a
departure from the trend line as shown in Fig. 27(a).

PThe variation of critical velocity gradient with equivalence ratio
for hydrogen/oxygen-argon observed by Fine [108] is shown in
Fig. 28. An increase in pressure increases the velocity gradient at
which flashback occurs, as previously mentioned. Data points for
both burner diameters are coincident as no significant different was

Pinterchangeability of fuels [58]. Boundary layer flashback was inves-
tigated for natural gas, methane, ethane, and propane with air as an
oxidizer. Burner diameters ranging from 0.390 to 1.358 cm were
used. The laminar flow was fully developed at the burner exit and
the burner head temperature was controlled to remain at room tem-
perature before starting each test.

PFig. 29 indicates the variation of critical velocity gradient as func-
tion of “fraction of stoichiometric” (i.e. the fuel percentage divided
by the stoichiometric fuel percentage) for natural gas, methane, eth-
ane, and propane. Flashback curves in Fig. 29 qualitatively peak at
the same fraction of stoichiometric for methane, natural gas, and
ethane. However, the flashback curve of propane slightly shifts to
the right as previously verified by Harris et al. [51] and shown in
Fig. 17.

PMethane/air mixtures have the lowest flashback propensity of
the hydrocarbon fuels studied. The critical velocity gradient for natu-
ral gas is slightly higher than that of methane due to the presence of
higher hydrocarbons in the mixture. Ethane has a higher critical
velocity gradient than propane at lean conditions, while the opposite
is true at rich conditions. In order to interpret the difference in flash-
back limits, the laminar burning velocity of these fuels, as deter-
mined by Davis and Law [153] are compared in Fig. 30. As shown,
the laminar burning velocity of methane is lower than other fuels.
The laminar burning velocity of ethane is slightly higher than pro-
pane within the stoichiometric and rich conditions, which can be
also observed in [154,155]. Therefore, the critical velocity gradient

Pobserved with the exception of equivalence ratio of 2.25. The diame-
ter dependence at the richest condition is attributed to diffusion
effects at the burner rim. The maximum critical velocity gradient
occurs at about 39 percent hydrogen for both helium and argon
diluted mixtures. This value agrees well with previous studies con-
ducted for hydrogen-air flames [47,67,71].

PThe results from the literature indicate that flashback limits are
strongly affected by the preheat temperature and operating pres-
sure. An increase of preheat temperature increases the laminar flame
speed causing flashback to occur at higher air flow rate for a given
equivalence ratio. Furthermore, the propagation of the flame front
into the tube is a function of the burner tip temperature. Since the
burner temperature remains approximately constant at the preheat
temperature, the quenching distance significantly decreases at high
preheat temperatures. In order to determine the effect of preheat
temperature on flashback propensity, both laminar flame speed and
quenching distance need to be considered for various fuel composi-
tions.

PAll laminar flame flashback studies in the literature are limited to
one atmosphere or sub-atmospheric operating pressures. The effect
of sub-atmospheric pressure on critical velocity gradient is primarily
determined by the fuel composition and equivalence ratio. In fact,
the laminar flame speed of different fuels can increase or decrease
with an increases of pressure at lean or rich conditions, and this
pressure dependence is weak in many cases [149,151,152]. As a
result, the quenching distance plays a crucial role in changing the
flashback limit. The quenching effect can be significant when deter-
mining the overall variation of flashback limits regardless of an
increase or decreases of laminar burning velocity with pressure.
Despite the insight offered by the studies discussed in this section,
for practical devices operating at elevated pressure or with high
hydrogen content fuels, the flow is usually turbulent, hence applica-
tion of these results is dubious.

4.4. Fuel composition

PWith the general ability of flashback tendencies of laminar flames
to be characterized with the critical velocity gradient concept,
experimental efforts were directed towards using the concept to
help determine the stability limits of various fuel compositions.

investigate the effect of individual fuels and their mixtures at room

Pbehavior shown in Fig. 29 does not follow the qualitative variation of
the laminar burning velocity for propane, and ethane.

PFig. 31 shows the flashback propensity of methane-propane and
methane-ethane as a function of fuel volume concentration as stud-
ied by Davu et al. [93]. The addition of 25% propane to methane
increases the maximum critical velocity gradient from 400 1/s to
490 1/s. Similarly with an addition of 5% ethane, the critical velocity
gradient has the same amount of increase. This is consistent with
the previous observation associated with Fig. 29 regarding the
higher peak of critical velocity gradient for ethane.

P4.4.2. Hydrogen rich fuels

PFurther discussion is now directed at hydrogen/air mixtures
owing to the known high flashback propensity of hydrogen. Hydro-
gen has higher burning velocities and a smaller quenching distance
than hydrocarbons [68,156]. The thermal and mass diffusivity of
hydrogen are considerably larger compared to those for hydrocar-
bon fuels. Furthermore, reaction kinetics of hydrocarbons are basi-
cally limited by CO ! CO2, which is relatively slow. The reaction
kinetics of hydrogen is fast due in part to the lack of this step which
must occur in all hydrocarbons fuels [141,157]. As a result, the flash-
back propensity of hydrogen is generally much higher than hydro-
carbon fuels.

PVon Elbe and Mentser [48] were the first to measure the flash-
back propensity of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure for different
burner diameters varied from 0.108 to 0.33 cm. Water-cooling
was used to control the temperature of the burner head. Fig. 32
indicates the critical velocity gradient variation of hydrogen for
the laminar flame [48]. The solid curve shows the flashback limit
where the flame fully propagates upstream. The region between
the dashed curved (beginning of partial entrance) and solid curve
represents the partial entrance of the flame front into the burner,
described as a tilted flame in [47]. The region of tilted flame is
more extensive than that observed for natural gas flames as pre-
viously discussed in Section 4.2. These regions invoke perturba-
tions to the stable flame and consequently led to flashback
except at very lean or rich conditions [48]. Critical velocity gradi-
ent values of hydrogen shown in Fig. 32 are significantly larger
than those for methane shown in Fig. 13. The maximum critical
velocity gradient of hydrogen/air flames is more than twenty

hydrogen concentration (equivalence ratio of 1.59).

PFig. 33 illustrates the laminar burning velocity of hydrogen/air
mixture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure obtained
from Koroll et al [30]. The maximum laminar burning velocity
occurs at 42 percent hydrogen concentration and is in good
agreement with the maximum critical velocity gradient observed
in Fig. 32.

P4.4.3. Fuel mixtures

PEarly studies demonstrated that the flashback propensity of
binary mixtures is not generally a linear function of the individ-
ual components, especially when hydrogen or carbon monoxide
is one of the components [55,57]. To better understand the
behavior of binary mixtures, a comprehensive study was con-
ducted by Grumer and Harris to investigate the flashback pro-
pensity of methane-hydrogen, carbon monoxide-hydrogen, and

Pcarbon monoxide-methane [57]. Experiments were carried out
for several ratios of the two components. Since it was difficult to
make a stability diagram for all different fuel compositions,
results were presented in terms of critical velocity gradient vari-
ation as a function of hydrogen or carbon monoxide addition at
given fraction of stoichiometric (F).

PFig. 34 indicates the variation of critical velocity gradient for
hydrogen-methane/air flames. From 0 to 50% hydrogen concentra-
tion, the ratio is defined by H2/CH4 and from 50 to 100% hydrogen,
the ratio is denoted by CH4/H2. The results are presented for both
fuel lean and rich conditions as labeled by the fraction of stoichio-
metric in Fig. 34. Adding a small amount of methane to hydrogen
decreases flashback propensity significantly; however, adding a
small amount of hydrogen to the methane does not drastically
increase the critical velocity gradient.

PThis observation is consistent with the variation of the laminar
flame speed for hydrogen-natural gas mixtures [161]. Fig. 35 indi-
cates the variation of the normalized laminar burning velocity as a
function of hydrogen concentration in the mixture at equivalence
ratio ranging from 0.6 to 1.4. Based on the definition in [161], the
burning velocity increment can be defined as:

mixture extends from stoichiometric fraction of 0.6 to 2.2, which is
wider than that for hydrogen-methane mixtures (Fig. 34). If Fig. 36 is
plotted in normal axis as a function of hydrogen concentration, the
critical velocity gradient linearly varies for fraction of stoichiometric
less than 1.4. However, when the hydrogen concentration is high,
the critical velocity gradient increases rapidly with further increase
in hydrogen content. This observation is consistent with the normal-
ized laminar burning velocity measurement (see Eq. (36)) by Dong

mixture as a function of hydrogen concentration at different equivalence ratios [161].

Pthe overall trend, which is not predicted by the laminar burning
velocity variation. There is no explanation for this observation in
[57].

PTo further explore the subtleties of fuel mixture effects, Fig. 38
presents the variation of critical velocity gradient for carbon monox-
ide-hydrogen/air mixtures as a function of fuel volume concentra-
tion. The addition of hydrogen to carbon monoxide significantly
increases the critical velocity gradient. The effect of hydrogen con-
centration on critical velocity gradient is pronounced at lean condi-
tions according to Fig. 38(a) (data from Grumer and Harris [57]).
However, this conclusion is not consistent with the recent experi-
mental study by Dam et al. [96]. Indeed, as indicated in Fig. 38(b),
the effect of hydrogen addition in lean mixtures is small compared
to its effect when added to fuel rich conditions. Furthermore, the
addition of hydrogen shifts the peak of critical velocity gradient to
lean conditions in Fig. 38(a), while the opposite is observed in Fig. 38
(b). It is noted the maximum critical velocity gradient of hydrogen
occurs at 40% fuel concentration as previously observed in Fig. 32
[48], which is in agreement with the qualitative trend observed in
Fig. 38(a).

PFig. 39 presents the critical velocity gradient variation of carbon
monoxide-methane/air mixtures. Adding small amount of meth-
ane to carbon monoxide increases the flashback propensity drasti-
cally. However, the addition of small amounts of carbon monoxide
to methane has only a slight effect. The molecular weight of
methane is smaller than that of carbon monoxide and the addition
of methane would be even smaller in terms of mass fraction. This
illustrates that the dissimilar behavior resulting from adding a
second fuel component to a single gas cannot be explained by dif-
ference in mass fraction [57].

PThe critical velocity gradient variation in Fig. 39 is in accordance
with the laminar burning velocity measurements by Scholte and
Vaags [163] (shown in Fig. 40). Fig. 40 shows the burning velocity of
methane-carbon monoxide mixtures as a function of the fuel/air
ratio. An addition of a small amount of methane significantly
increases the laminar burning velocity. With adding more methane,
the laminar burning velocity peaks at about 90% CO-10% CH4 and
finally drops to the methane burning velocity. It is interesting to
note that a similar point exists in Fig. 39 (i.e. CH4/CO D 0.1) at which
the critical velocity gradient is maximum. Furthermore, Fig. 39 illus-
trates that methane has a higher flashback propensity than carbon
monoxide for fraction of stoichiometric less than 1.2, which is con-
sistent with the laminar burning velocity variation reported in [163].
PTo create a stability diagram for a specific fuel binary composi-
tions, one can select the fuel component ratios in Fig. 34, Fig. 36,

ferent fuel concentrations (F), reproduced from [57].

PThe flashback propensity of air mixed with hydrogen-ethylene,
propane-hydrogen, and hydrogen diluted with nitrogen was also
investigated by Grumer et al. [65]. Fig. 41 and Fig. 42 present experi-
mental results for these mixtures. Adding small amounts of ethylene
or propane to hydrogen significantly decreases the flashback

ylene or propane increases the critical velocity gradient to a small
extent.

PFig. 43 illustrates the variation of laminar burning velocity for
propane-hydrogen/air mixtures as a function of equivalence ratio at
various hydrogen concentrations [164]. Xh denotes the volume per-
cent of hydrogen in the fuel mixture. For a given equivalence ratio,
small increase of propane in the pure hydrogen results in a signifi-
cantly lower laminar flame speed and consequently much lower
flashback limit as concluded in [55,65].

PThese results again indicate that the flashback propensity of mul-
ticomponent fuels is not a linear combination of the critical velocity
gradient of single components involving hydrogen or carbon monox-
Xfor certain fuel components,

a weighted average critical velocity gradient can been successfully
applied. These fuels include binary and ternary hydrocarbon fuels
including mixtures of alkanes and alkenes such as methane, ethane,
propane, butane, and ethylene as studied in [65,72]. Fig. 44 illus-
trates the flame stability diagram of mixture containing 79.4% meth-
ane-20.6% ethylene. The solid curve represents the calculated data

in which, y and z are fuel components and n is fractional volume con-
centration of each component. Values of gy, gz are obtained from crit-
ical velocity gradients of single component fuels.

PWhen hydrogen and carbon monoxide are present in multicom-
ponent fuels, a modified version of Eq. (37) was developed to calcu-
late the critical velocity gradient of ternary fuel mixtures. Indeed,
the critical velocity gradient of a multicomponent fuel is calculated
from flashback limits of binary fuel mixtures, which are available for
different fuel compositions as previously discussed. For a mixture
including three gases a, b, and g, a combination of two binary fuels
a C b D ny and a C g D nz are considered in which the value of a is
devide between b and g in the ratio of b/g. The selection of a, b, and
g for a ternary fuel mixture was based on experimental results. For a
fuel mixture containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane,
the binary fuel components are selected as CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4 and H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4.
Fig. 45 illustrates the evaluation of the implemented method for
three fuel components. The curve lines represent calculated values
from Eq. (37) and predict experimental results fairly well as shown
in Fig. 45(a). But, clear deviation is observed in Fig. 45(b) at rich con-
dition.

PEq. (37) was also implemented to predict the flashback propen-
sity of multicomponent fuels as summarized in Table 2. Carbon diox-
ide and nitrogen were treated as diluents. This means that associated
critical velocity gradients of these constituents are considered to be
zero in Eq. (37). The critical velocity gradients of these fuels were
calculated by assuming different single and binary mixtures as indi-
cated in Table 3. As mentioned earlier, the selection of a was not

PThis method was extended to characterize the flashback
propensity of mixtures diluted with inert gases including nitro-
gen and carbon dioxide. The characteristic values of binary and
multicomponent fuels (gc)M, fM, and a were determined as
functions of
inert-free mixture and diluents concentrations.
Some correlation were developed for hydrogen, carbon monox-
ide, methane, ethane, ethylene, and propane with combination of
either nitrogen or carbon monoxide [78].

PA similar approach was used by Van Krevelen et al. for binary and
multicomponent fuel mixtures and characteristic values were tabu-
lated in [78]. As previously pointed out, the characteristic parame-
ters for mixtures of hydrocarbons are additive [57,65]. Consistent
with earlier studies, it was concluded that this cannot be extended
to mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen with hydrocarbons
[78]. Furthermore, the behavior of the carbon monoxide was men-
tioned to be abnormal in many respects. Hence, “depression factors”
were defined to capture this effect.

PIn further work to predict fuel composition effects when hydro-
gen is present, Caffo and Padovani developed a simpler method to

ized flashback curve has a peak value (gc)R D 1 at FR D 1. Using
characteristic values in Table 4 and generalized flashback curve in
Fig. 47 (semi-log plot), one can obtain the critical velocity gradient
at desired fuel concentration for studied fuels using Eq. (38) and
Eq. (39).

Ppredict the flashback propensity in multicomponent fuels [81]. In
their correlation, the critical velocity gradient of multicomponent
fuels was calculated by assigning a constant coefficient to hydrocar-
bons and a variable coefficient to hydrogen. Thus, the critical veloc-
ity gradient of inert-free mixtures was introduced as:

X

ai£%Ci

£%H2 C

gc D aH2
where ai is a coefficient for hydrocarbons present in the mixture. ai is
fixed for each component depending on the equivalence ratio. aH2 is
the hydrogen coefficient represented as a function of the mixture
stoichiometric air coefficient (As) and the concentration of other
hydrocarbons (%Ci) accompanying the hydrogen. Based on the
experimental results, aH2 was presented in the form of:

ð40Þ

D

ð41Þ

Ki£%Ci

aH2
in which Ki is determined from the mixture stoichiometric air coeffi-
cient (As). This variation is indicated in Fig. 48 for various fuels and
nitrogen as a diluentD
X. The overall value of aH2 is primarily affected by
(As) according to Eq. (41). The values of ai are also tabulated in
Table 5. This result was also extended to carbon monoxide and
different coefficients were tabulated in [81]. It is noted that all coeffi-
cients in Table 5 and reference [81] were obtained for stoichiometric
conditions and cannot be generally extended to other equivalence
ratios. The study by Caffo and Padovani indicates that the critical
velocity gradient of the hydrogen and hydrocarbons mixtures can be
expressed as a function of the mixture stoichiometric air coefficient.
This method was evaluated for various fuel compositions at stoichio-
metric condition with hydrogen concentration varied from 8% to
56% in the fuel mixture and the results matched experimental dataD
within 5% [81].

PCorrelations for lashback propensity of multicomponent fuel
mixtures under laminar conditions were also developed by Putnam
et al. [85]. They examined different fuel compositions as summa-
rized in Table 6 [85]. Flashback propensity of each mixture was
determined for various equivalence ratios and the value of gcdq/SL
was calculated for each case and reported in Table 6. Each group
labeled by (a, b, and c) has a constant adiabatic flame temperature
and a constant product composition at stoichiometric condition.
The burning velocity was measured by determining the flame
front angle stabilized above the burner rim. Quenching distance
was reported as the minimum width between two plates in
which the flame can propagate. The critical velocity gradient was
calculated from Eq. (5). The equivalence ratio corresponding to

mum quenching distance value However, the peak of the burning
velocity (SL) occurred at lower equivalence ratioD
X compared to
that corresponding to the maximum gc and minimum dq condi-
tion. This deviation was attributed to the burning velocity mea-
surement procedure for the atmospheric test conditions. The

PIn summary, fuel composition can significantly impact the flash-
back limit as illustrated for single, binary, and multi-component
fuels. A direct relationship between laminar burning velocity and
flashback propensity is clearly observed for all fuel mixtures as pre-
dicted by simple models. Different studies have developed various
correlations for the flashback limit of multicomponent fuels. Many
of the studies observed that special consideration is required when
hydrogen or carbon monoxide is present in the mixture. The empiri-
cal equations include various coefficients which are not known or
validated for all operation conditions and experiment configura-
tions. However, qualitative comparisons made in Section 4.4 can be
served as a tool to investigate the interchangeability of fuel gases
[54,58].

4.5. Numerical analysis

PNumerical simulations of boundary layer flashback have pro-
vided important details about the influence of the flame on the flow
field. One-dimensional numerical simulations have been conducted
for flame propagation normal to the wall (see head-on quenching in
Fig. 7) by different studies [123,125,165(cid:1)169]. However, only a few
studies have addressed laminar boundary layer flashback, and these
are summarized in this section.

PThe first numerical study was performed by Lee and T’D

Xien [86]
in 1982 for propagation of a premixed laminar flame through a
tube. The analysis was limited to small diameters due to the
computational cost. This pioneering simulation showed the
importance of the flame back-pressure due to flame-flow interac-
tion. The steady state Navier-Stokes and energy equations were
solved numerically for the laminar flow with singleD
X-step chemi-
cal reaction and second order finite rate Arrhenius kinetics. A
parabolic velocity profile for fully developed laminar flow was
assumed at inlet condition with a variable magnitude in order to
produce stationary flame representing the flashback condition.
The wall temperature was considered equal to the unburned
mixture temperature (T0 D 298 K). The effect of the tube radius
on flashback limits was studied for ten cases at equivalence ratio
of 1 as indicated in Fig. 50. The reference length (L) was defined
by the flame thickness, which is the ratio of thermal diffusivity
to the one-dimensional laminar burning velocity (a=SL D 4:629£
¡3 cm). The reference value of SL D 38 cm/s was used as a scaling
10
parameter. As the tube radius decreases, the critical velocity

Fig. 50. Critical velocity gradient as a function of tube radius, reproduced from [86].

Pgradient increases and then abruptly reduces. This trend line is
similar to the experimental results of Lewis and Elbe [47] in Fig. 14.
At first, when the tube diameter decreases, the quenching distance
moves closer to the tube axis and the critical velocity gradient
assumption based on the linear velocity profile close to the wall is
not valid. With further decrease of the tube diameter, the flame
within the entire tube is influence by the quenching effect.

PFig. 50 also shows that the calculated critical velocity gradient
reaches a plateau independent of the tube radius since the flame sta-
bilization zone remains approximately unchanged at sufficiently
large diameters. This value seems slightly high compared to mea-
sured critical velocity gradient value in the experimental data of
[113] (denoted by dashed line in Fig. 50). The quenching limit was
interpolated from calculated results (indicated by dotted line) and
the tube radius at which quenching occurs is lower than reported
experimental values in [113]. It is noted that the experimental data
in [47,113] were obtained for an unconfined flame stabilized in
ambient air, while the numerical analysis was conducted for a con-
fined flame.

PThe flame front is bent towards the unburned reactants through
nearly the entire channel since the tube size was relatively small
(recall the smallest diameter used by Lewis and Elbe). The shape and
characteristic of the flame front are similar to the observation based
on experimental results in Fig. 5 [47,48,63]. The flame front is
strongly curved inside the tube and one-dimensional flame sheet
cannot provide a realistic valueD
X for the laminar flame speed, espe-
cially close to the tube wall (see the isothermal line in Fig. 51).

PThe static pressure increases normal to the flame front and
then decreases, which is in agreement with velocity vectors in
Fig. 51. The unburned mixture decelerates as it approaches the
flame front in Fig. 51. When the temperature of the mixture
increases across the flame front, the density decreases and flow
velocity increases accordingly.
Interaction between velocity,
pressure, and heat release leads to the distortion of the stream-
line before entering the flame zone, previously observed in
experimental results of [170,171]. Divergence of the velocity vec-
tors continues through the reaction zone and, as the flow passes
the flame, the streamlines become parallel to the tube axis. The
calculated burning velocity along the tube axis was higher than
the one-dimensional laminar flame speed due to the interaction
of the flame and pressure field [86].

PLee and T’D

Xien [86] only considered the confined flame configura-
tion. However, in practical applications, the flame is generally stabi-
lized downstream of the burner rim. Mallens and Goey conducted a
numerical study for unconfined methane/air flames and compared
results with the experimental data [89]. The experimental setup by

Pburners. The experimental data agree well with the numerical
results and the difference is less than 10% for all widths and diame-
ters studied [89]. The deviation is more significant for the tube
burner, possibly due to the low mass flow rate and associated uncer-
tainty in measurements which can be up to 15 percent. The experi-
mental results of Harris et al. [51] are shown as solid squares for two
tube burner diameters of 8.82 and 9.66 mm. As suggested by the
numerical results in Fig. 52, the slit burner has a lower critical veloc-
ity gradient than the tube burner, which is consistent with the con-
clusion made by Putnam and Jensen [52]. The difference between
the two burner configurations reduces to less than 5 percent for
burner diameters larger than 6 mm. This trend is not predicted by
experimental results probably due to the measurement uncertainty.
Furthermore, the effect of tip temperature can be significant for the
tube burner since it was not cooled in this experiment.

PThe critical velocity gradient decreases with an increases of
burner diameter or channel width, which is consistent with the
numerical results by Lee and T’D
Xien [86]. As the burner diameter
decreases, the quenching distance is comparable to the burner diam-
eter and consequently the velocity at which flashback occurs can no
longer be estimated by a linear velocity profile.

PFig. 53 presents the variation of critical velocity gradient as a
function of equivalence ratio for the 5 mm diameter burner. The
numerical results match well with experimental data within equiva-
lence ratio of 0.9 and 1.1. However, the numerical model does not
follow the experiment trend line outside this interval. The deviation
between numerical and experimental results is significant for the
lowest and highest equivalence ratios studied. This is attributed to
inaccuracies in the calculated burning velocity resulting from the
singleD
X-step chemical reaction as well as inaccuracies in flow rates
when setting the equivalence ratio in the experiment. The maximum
critical velocity gradient occurs at equivalence ratio of 1, corre-
sponding to experiment by Harris et al. [51].

PKurdyumov et al. [90] carried out a simplified analysis of bound-
ary layer flashback. They investigated the propagation of a flame
close to the wall inside a tube, the diameter of which was much
larger than the preheated flame thickness. With this condition, the
computational domain was modeled by the flow over a flat plate
and the so-called thermal-diffusive approximation was used.
Neglecting the density and viscosity variation with temperature, the
laminar velocity profile (u D Ay, v D 0) remains undisturbed through
the entire domain. As a result, energy and deficient reactant mass
conservations were solved without fluid dynamic coupling in non-
dimensional forms for adiabatic and isothermal wall boundary

PMallens and Goey consisted of a rectangular slit burner with cross
section of 55 mm £ 2b, in which 2b was varied from 4 to 10 mm. The
burner rim temperature was kept constant at 50 °C by water cooling.
A similar setup was used to measure the flashback propensity of
flames stabilized downstream of circular tubes with diameters from
4 to 10 mm. The tip temperature was not controlled during this
experiment as it was believed to have a negligible effect on flashback
limits. The range of equivalence ratio covered in both experiment
was between 0.9 and 1.1 and flow was fully developed at the burner
exit.

PMallens and Goey also conducted a steady two-dimensional sim-
ulation of both laminar premixed flames considered in their experi-
mental study. Governing equations of motion D
Xand energy were
formulated with stream-vorticity functions and solved considering
singleD
X-step chemical reaction with the Arrhenius type source term.
A parabolic velocity profile was used at inlet condition. The detailed
description of the numerical method implemented is available else-
where [89,172(cid:1)174]. In order to simulate the flashback limit by the
steady code, the bulk flow velocity was decreased incrementally (5
percent reduction at each step) to reach the condition when the
flame did not stabilize at the burner rim and propagated upstream.
This critical flow rate was reported as a flashback limit for numerical
results.

PThe comparison of numerical and experimental results is illus-
trated in Fig. 52. The critical velocity gradient variation as a function
of burner width and diameter are shown for both slit and tube

Ptube normalized by the planar laminar burning velocity for various
Lewis numbers [92]. The isothermal and adiabatic boundary condi-
tions are denoted by solid and dashed lines, respectively. The circle
symbols show the tube radius at which the flame quenching occurs.
For Lewis number less than unity, the calculated flame speed is
larger than that of the adiabatic planar burning velocity due to the
cellular flame structure. It is noted that two solutions exist for the
isothermal wall, upper branch (stable) and lower branch (unstable),
separated by the quenching radius. For Lewis number larger than
unity, the flame propagation approaches the planar burning velocity
monotonically by an increase of the tube radius. For unity Lewis
number, the curve has a “mushroom-shaped” as observed in
[88,175] and the stable branch approaches the planar flame speed
asymptotically. When the tube diameter is sufficiently large com-
pared to the quenching radius, three dimensional analysis is
required and calculated burning velocity changes significantly [92].
However, if the tube diameter is similar to the quenching diameter,
two dimensional analysis successfully predicts the results since the
flame structure is essentially two dimensional.

PFlame propagation in the boundary layer was studied numeri-
cally and experimentally by Kurdyumov et al. [94] and qualitative
agreement was observed. The experiment was conducted with pro-
pane/air and methane/air mixtures at equivalence ratio of 0.53 and
0.57, respectively. The tube diameter was 21.4 mm and laminar flow
was fully developed with the Reynolds number less than 150 for all
cases. The flame was stabilized downstream of the burner similar to
the experiment by Lewis and Elbe [47]. Kurdyumov et al. imple-
mented laser tomography to capture the streamlines through the
steady flame [94]. A tilted flame flashback was observed in this
experiment and Fig. 8(b) indicates the flame anchoring inside the
tube burner. The flame front is strongly curved close to the tube wall
as previously illustrated in Fig. 5 [47,48,63]. The flame thickness was
estimated around 0.23 mm and since it is significantly smaller than
the tube diameter, the flame structure was considered two-dimen-
sional in the laser sheet plane near the wall. Fig. 55(a) shows the
tomographic cut of streamlines across the flame zone. The parabolic
velocity profile is also indicated in Fig. 55(a) within 9 mm from the
tube wall. As the flow approaches the flame front, the streamline
departs from the parallel path along the tube wall due to back pres-
sure of the flame front.

PThe critical velocity gradient of methane/air mixture at equiva-
lence ratio of 0.57 was 50 1/s, which is in good agreement with
Lewis and Von Elbe's results [47] shown in Fig. 13. The value for

Pconditions.
XSingle-step chemical reaction with Arrhenius kinetics
was used while taking into account the effect of Lewis number of dif-
ferent fuels. The Karlovitz number was used to present flashback
limits and defined as (ag=S2
L ), which is inversely proportional to the
Damk€ohler number (Ka D 1/Da). Based on this definition, flashback
occurs if the velocity gradient drops below a critical value. For Lewis
number less than unity, the diffusion of the fuel is enhanced, result-
ing in an increase in flame temperature and, consequently, higher
burning velocity. Hence, the critical velocity gradient increases with
a decrease in Lewis number leading to higher Karlovitz number. The
Lewis number effect is more pronounced for the adiabatic wall
boundary condition.

PAs pointed out, the governing equations of motion were not
solved in this analysis and consequently the flame-flow interaction
was not captured by the simulation. The interaction of heat release,
pressure, and velocity distribution plays a crucial role in boundary
layer flashback inside a tube or channel as discussed in Section 5.4.

PA two-dimensional simulation of the flame propagation in a tube
was also carried out in [91,92] considering the thermo-diffusive
approximation. Fig. 54 shows the flame propagation velocity in a

Pthe propane/air mixture at equivalence ratio of 0.53 was found to be
39 1/s, which is in agreement with results from [113].

PThe steady Navier-Stokes and energy equations were solved
numerically along singleD
X-step chemical reaction and Arrhenius law
[94]. The two dimensional numerical simulation was similar to the
study in [86], but final equation were simplified by asymptotic tech-
niques for scale parameters of the problem. The effect of Lewis num-
ber was studied as a parameter, while the Prandtl number was
assumed to be a constant value at 0.72. The dependency of viscosity,
thermal conductivity, and fuel diffusivity on the temperature were
represented by a power law function. Streamlines obtained from
numerical results is similar to the experimental results as indicated
in Fig. 55(b). Streamlines are deviated as approaching the flame front
and then become parallel to the tube wall, which is consistent with
observation in Fig. 55(a).

PFig. 56 illustrates the critical Damk€ohler number as a function of
Lewis number for isothermal and adiabatic wall boundary condi-
tions. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 56 for comparison.
With a decrease in the Lewis number, the Damk€ohler number
decreases, corresponding to increased flashback propensity. The
experimental results of methane/air with Le (cid:4) 1.8 and propane/air
with Le (cid:4) 0.97 mixture show that the flashback occurs at critical con-
ditions of Da D 9.8 and Da D 6.5, respectively, which are in agreement
with the numerical results shown in Fig. 56. For Lewis numbers less
than unity, the differential diffusion and curvature effects cause a
higher flame temperature and burning velocity. It is important to
realize that the real boundary condition of the tube wall is the com-
bination of both isothermal and adiabatic cases and the experimen-
tal data fall within these two limits (i.e. solid and dashed lines) as
indicated in Fig. 56.

PThe flame-wall interaction of the laminar flow has been numeri-
cally studied in the literature through one-dimensional and multidi-
mensional analyses. The one-dimensional numerical modeling of
laminar flame-wall
interaction was mainly focused on head-on
quenching in which the premixed flame propagates perpendicular
to the wall. However, these studies cannot be applied to boundary
layer flashback since the flame propagates parallel to the wall and
Xreaction mechanisms
the sidewall quenching occurs. In addition,
used in most of these studies areD
X limited to the single-step model,
which is not able to provide realistic results due to the lack of recom-
bination reactions near the wall.

PThe multidimensional numerical simulation of wall-flame inter-
action is expensive in terms of computational time. As a result,
much of the existing research in the literature feature single-step
chemical reaction mechanisms or are simplified by the thermal-dif-
fusive approximation. The latter case neglects fluid dynamics cou-
pling in which the flow is not affected by the thermal expansion
resulting from the presence of the flame.

4.6. Key points and status

P(cid:3) For unconfined flames, the interaction between the approaching
reactants and the flame is small which is a major assumption
underlying the critical velocity gradient concept. In this case, the
critical velocity gradient concept to be successfully applied to
predict flashback. The flow-flame interaction is significant in
confined flames and thus the concept is less able to capture the
behavior and a new physical framework is needed to account for
these cases. Work in recent years has established this frame-
work (e.g., [99]).

P(cid:3) Generalization of the concept to flows that are not fully devel-
oped has yet to be completely evaluated. Most studies specifi-
cally generate fully developed flow to allow analytical
expressions to be used to estimate the velocity gradient near the
wall. The role of developing flow in impacting flashback remains
an open question.

P(cid:3) The role of the quenching distance is very important and yet
different concepts are used to establish the value of this
parameter. The quenching distance is measured between two
parallel plates (inside a tube) or approximated by the flame
thickness. These concepts may not be able to provide realis-
tic values for the boundary layer flashback in which sidewall
quenching occurs.

P(cid:3) Burner diameter plays a role in flashback once it falls below
a certain diameter, which is comparable to the quenching
distance. Above this diameter, burner diameter appears to be
unimportant based on studies isolating this parameter. From
a practical view,
for uncooled burners, thermal coupling
between the flame and the burner results in a complex inter-
action between factors impacting heat transfer (e.g., flame
temperature, flame proximity to the burner rim, product
composition, and burner diameter). This interaction is not
captured by models of the flashback process in any compre-
hensive manner.

P(cid:3) The reactant temperature plays a strong role on flashback of
laminar flames. This is due to temperature effect on both the
flame propagation rates (they increase with temperature)
and quenching distance (reduces with increased tempera-
ture). The relative changes in these two parameters is a func-
to difficulty in
tion of
generalizing the effect in a manner that can be readily cap-
tured with a simple model. These effects, when also consid-
ered in the heat transfer impacts mentioned in regards to
burner diameter effects, require careful consideration in any
general model.

composition which leads

fuel

P(cid:3) Only a few studies have considered the impacts of operating
pressure on laminar flame flashback. The laminar flame speed
dependence on pressure has been established for many condi-
tions in recent years and generally decreases weakly with an
increase of pressure. The quenching distance, which is propor-
tional to the flame thickness, decreases roughly linearly with
pressure and plays the main role for increased flashback propen-
sity at high pressure.

P(cid:3) Fuel composition plays a complex role on flashback behavior,
but straightforward correlations have been developed to capture
these effects especially for burners with controlled temperature.
If hydrogen or carbon monoxide is involved in the mixture, addi-
tional consideration is required. The addition of small amounts
of these species can have a strong impact on flashback propen-
sity for a given condition.

P(cid:3) Numerical simulation of flashback in laminar jet flames has been
carried out on a limited basis. Highly simplified chemistry and
two dimensional approaches have been used with some success,
but general agreement with experimental results is not as close
as desired.

5. Turbulent flames

PAs discussed in Section 4, boundary layer flashback of laminar
flames has been extensively investigated in the literature and the
critical velocity gradient concept is able to capture the overall
behavior. However, the flame-wall interaction in turbulent flows is
significantly more complex [176]. Considering the nature of turbu-
lent flashback which, to a large degree, is a function of turbulent
Reynolds number, spatially and temporally resolved diagnostics are
required to capture the detailed processes. Due to computational
complexity and the inherent temporal nature of turbulent flashback,
simulations of the phenomena are relatively few with recent direct
numerical simulations by Gruber et al. [100,108] one notable exam-
ple. Due to the lack and/or cost of appropriate computational and
experimental resources, many researchers have relied on the basic
theory developed for laminar flames by Lewis and Von Elbe [47] in
an attempt to estimate flashback in turbulent flames. As is discussed
in this section, application of the basic theory has been made with
some success although some completely new approaches have been
considered in recent years.

5.1. Prediction models

PThe laminar burning velocity and quenching distance can be
measured by different techniques [177,178] as implemented by
many researchers. However, extending laminar boundary layer
flashback results to turbulent flames requires additional consider-
ation. Also, in practice, the velocity profile at the burner head is not
always fully developed due to the short length of premixer or pres-
ence of a nozzle or other feature in the premixer passage. The simple
critical velocity gradient concept may not apply to such cases as evi-
denced by the study of Yamazaki and Tsuji [80] for a converging noz-
zle with different perforated plates. Nevertheless, the concept of
critical velocity gradient originally developed for laminar flames has
been frequently used for characterizing turbulent boundary layer
flashback propensity in the literature.

PKhitrin et al. studied the turbulent flashback propensity for
methane-air, methane-oxygen, and hydrogen-air mixtures [82].
Fig. 57 presents the flashback velocity of laminar and turbulent
flames as a function of hydrogen concentration in the mixture.
Different points on the solid line show various burner diameters
as labeled in Fig. 57. Two dashed lines represent the flashback of
laminar hydrogen flame from [48]. The velocity at which flash-
back occurs is much higher for turbulent flames. According to
Fig. 57, flashback velocity under turbulent conditions is not
strongly affected by burner diameter while the flashback velocity
of laminar flame is a function of diameter which is also consis-
tent with Fig. 12 and Eq. (5).

PFig. 58 illustrates the experimental data with respect to the criti-
cal velocity gradient model on a log-log plot. While the trends are
captured to some extent, the deviation from the solid line (Eq. (43))
is fairly significant in terms of predicting flashback propensity.

PIn this case, the critical velocity gradient model is not able to cor-
rectly predict the turbulent boundary layer flashback due to the sim-
plifying assumptions used in the original for the model, including (1)
linear velocity profile near the wall and (2) use of the unstretched
laminar burning velocity. However, the velocity gradient at the wall

in which Peflame D DSL/a and Pr is the Prandtl number of the
unburned mixture. This equation was obtained based on the laminar
critical velocity gradient model neglecting flame-flow interaction.
The extension of critical velocity gradient model to turbulent flame
was justified by assuming that the flashback of turbulent flame
occurs in the viscous sublayer (y C < 5) where the velocity profile is
linear. This basic model was applied to the experimental data for
methane/oxygen and methane/air mixtures under turbulent condi-
tions [82]. A Prandtl number of 0.9 was assumed for methane/
oxygen and methane/air mixtures and the penetration distance was
considered proportional to the one-dimensional flame thickness
(dp D Ka/SL) [82]. With these considerations, the final form of Eq. (42)

Pcan still characterize the local flow velocity and can be used along
with the local turbulent burning velocity for boundary layer flash-
back prediction as discussed in Section 5.4.2.

Pmagnitude is comparable to the burner diameter, the velocity at
which flashback occurs cannot be approximated by the linear veloc-
ity profile close to the wall. This observation is consistent with previ-
ous studies [47,48] for laminar flames.

5.2. Effect of flame configuration and boundary layer heating

PThe effect of thermal coupling between the burnerD

X and flame
front was noted in the literature even in the in the initial experi-
ments conducted by Lewis and von Elbe [47]. To reach flashback lim-
its, the equivalence ratio is required to be gradually increased such
that the burner rim temperature remains in balance with the heat
transfer from flame front, i.e. a quasi-steady process. It has been
observed that, if flashback is approached quickly in an uncooled
burner rim, the critical velocity gradient determined may be signifi-
cantly different from the result with a slow approach. The first com-
prehensive study to investigate the effect of tip temperature on
turbulent boundary layer flashback was conducted by Bollinger and
Edse [66]. The experiment was carried out for hydrogen/oxygen
flames at atmospheric pressure. The effect of burner material, burner
diameter, and tube wall thickness were studied. Experiments for
burners with small diameter were carried out in a closed room.
Some other tests with larger diameter tubes were conducted in an
open firing pit. The tip temperature was monitored using thermo-
couples mounted on the burner head. The flashback was approached
slowly to ensure that the thermal equilibrium was maintained as the
equivalence ratio increased.

PFig. 59 indicates the variation of critical velocity gradient as a
function of hydrogen concentration for various burner diameters
and thicknesses. Curves 2, 3, and 5 represent the effect of the burner
diameter on critical velocity gradient. Results from burner tubes
with diameters of 0.483 and 0.613 cm are similar at lean conditions.
However, the dilution of the excess hydrogen with surrounding air
leads to a significant deviation between results of curve 3 and 5 at
rich condition. Also, the trend line of curve 2 differs significantly
from two other burner tube diameters. This effect is more pro-
nounced for the curve 1 with thinner wall as illustrated in Fig. 59.
The ratio of quenching distance to burner diameter increases as the
burner diameter decreases. Indeed, once the quenching distance

Xwalls (0.009 in), D

Xi.e. curve 2 vs 1, curve 3 vs 4 in Fig. 59D

PThe critical velocity gradient of burners with thicker walls
(0.025 in) is consistently higher than that for burner tubes with thin-
ner D
X. The effect
of dilution via entrainment is stronger for thinner tube walls, leading
to lower burning velocity at the burner rim and consequently a more
stable flame. Hence, while the thicker tube wall may decrease tip
temperature, they are more prone to flashback due to the reduced
dilution effect according to [66].

PFig. 60 and Fig. 61 illustrate the effect of the burner tube material
on critical velocity gradient and tip temperature for a constant
burner thickness. The flashback propensity for the copper burner is
much lower than the other studied burner materials. This is due to
the significantly lower tip temperature of the copper burner as indi-
cated in Fig. 61. Comparing the thermal conductivity of burner mate-
rials studied in [179], it is observed that the tip temperature is
proportional to the thermal conductivity as indicated in Fig. 61. The
heat transfer from the flame to the burner balances with the heat
loss to the ambient air and the incoming unburned mixture. The
heat conduction along the tube wall is determined by the burner
material and consequently the heat loss increases with an increase
in thermal conductivity of the burner head, leading to lower burner
tip temperature. However, the critical velocity gradient variation
does not simply follow the thermal conductivity and tip temperature
variations for stainless steel, Inconel, and Monel as illustrated by
Fig. 60. The thermal conductivity of these materials is approximately
the same order of magnitude. The nickel burner has much higher
thermal conductivity than stainless steel, Inconel, and Monel result-
ing in lower tip temperature and critical velocity gradient.

PFlashback propensity of high hydrogen content fuels was studied
for an unconfined flame (recall Fig. 8) by Shaffer et al. [102]. Differ-
ent fuel compositions including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and
methane were investigated. The experiment was carried out at
atmospheric pressure and room temperature for two constant adia-
batic flame temperatures of 1700 and 1900 K. The flow was fully
developed at the burner exit. The premixed reactants were injected
through a quartz tube and flame was stabilized inside a quartz liner.
To approach flashback, the fuel and air mass flow rates were

Pand carbon monoxide. Different preheat temperatures of 300, 450,
588, and 810 K were examined for all fuel compositions mentioned.
To investigate the effect of tip temperature on flashback propensity,
burner heads constructed from stainless steel and quartz were used.
Comparing the critical mass flow rate for stainless steel and quartz
burners for a given fuel composition, it was concluded that the
quartz burner head increases the flashback propensity. This is attrib-
uted by Duan et al. [103,104] to an increase of tip temperature,
resulting from the lower thermal conductivity compared to the
stainless steel. A simple analytical heat transfer solution was derived
to show the dependency of the burner tip temperature on thermal
conductivity for non-preheated mixtures. Based on this analysis, the
tip temperature is proportional to square root of the thermal con-
ductivity for a jet flame operating at room temperature.

PSome correlations were developed in [103] based on statistical
analysis of the data to predict the critical velocity gradient as a func-
tion of fuel contents, thermal properties, laminar flame speed, ther-
mal properties, and quenching distance. The quenching distance
was approximated by the one-dimensional-flame thickness taking
into account the effect of wall temperature.

PDuan et al. studied the influence of burner materials and geomet-
rical flame configurations on flashback propensity of hydrogen/air
jet flames [104]. Different burners were investigated including open,
confined, and enclosed flames (recall Fig. 8). Two enclosures with
inner diameters of 44.45 and 63.5 mm were used to evaluate the
effect of enclosure size on tip temperature and flashback limits. Fur-
thermore, a ceramic block with a slightly larger inner diameter than
the injector diameter was connected to the injector, resembling the
confined flame.

PThe tip temperature of the enclosed flame was significantly
higher than the open flame as the recirculation of hot products influ-
ences the burner rim temperature. Comparison of the associated
critical velocity gradient indicated higher flashback propensity of
the enclosed flame for metal and quartz burner heads. The difference
between flashback limits of open and enclosed flames is more pro-
nounced for the quartz burner with lower thermal conductivity. As a
result, the difference in flashback limits is mainly due to boundary
layer heating, which can induce the upstream flame propagation.

PDuan et al. [104] also concluded that enclosure size has a negligi-
ble effect on tip temperature of the stainless steel burner, while it
significantly affects the quartz burner. The quartz burner has a
higher tip temperature for a given adiabatic flame temperature and
is more sensitive to the enclosure size. Hence, the critical velocity
gradient remains approximately constant for the stainless steel
burner and decreases with an increaseD
X of enclosure size for the
quartz burner. This indicates that the variation of critical velocity
gradient is a result of change in the tip temperature and conse-
quently the boundary layer heating. It also illustrates that a complex
interaction between burner geometry and materials exists.

PFig. 62 summarizes all results in terms of critical velocity gradient
as a function of equivalence ratio. Note that the confined flame has
significantly higher flashback propensity than unconfined flames
regardless of the burner size and material. This conclusion was noted
in [98] as will be discussed later. It was observed in [99] that the
flashback mechanism for confined flames is affected by the flame-
flow interaction in the near-wall region at the onset of flashback.
Indeed, a recirculation region exists in the boundary layer before
the flashback occurrence, enhancing the flame regression into the
burner (further discussed in Section 5.4). Cooling the burner
decreases the flashback propensity as seen from results of stainless
steel burner in Fig. 62. Furthermore, the injector diameter has a neg-
ligible effect on flashback limits of hydrogen flames, consistent with
the findings of Khitrin et al. [82].

PTurbulent boundary layer flashback D

channel with the presence of an adverse pressure gradient was

Pdecreased simultaneously such that the equivalence ratio remained
constant, corresponding to a given adiabatic flame temperature.

PThe hydrogen data were obtained without an enclosure for com-
parison with results from [82,98]. A significant difference was
observed for hydrogen with open flames and mainly attributed to
the burner material of the injector as burner cooling was not imple-
mented in this study. A quartz tube used in this experiment, while
the flame in [98] was stabilized on top of a brass pilot burner. Final
results of this study were presented in the form of a least squares
best fit correlation based on fuel compositions and adiabatic flame
temperatures as:

þ0:604:H2:CH4 þ0:00264:CH4:AFT2

ð44Þ

in which, the fuel concentration and adiabatic flame temperature
are in percent and Kelvin, respectively. The effect of fuel composi-
tion can be isolated in this correlation and some conclusions were
made by varying the fuel component concentration in Eq. (44). As
carbon monoxide or methane are added to the pure hydrogen, the
flashback propensity decreases to a different degree, which is con-
sistent with the conclusion in [103]. The hydrogen-carbon monox-
ide mixture is found to be more prone to flashback than the
hydrogen-methane for a given volume concentration of hydrogen
in the mixture. This is in agreement with laminar flashbackD
Xresults
shown in Fig. 34 for H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4 and Fig. 36 for H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO. It is noted
that the addition of the methane to hydrogen decreases the lami-
nar burning velocity exponentially (see Fig. 35), while the laminar
burning velocity of H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO mixture decreases linearly with an
increase of carbon monoxide (see Fig. 37).

PA similar correlation Eq. (45) was also developed for tip tempera-
ture variation as a function of fuel composition and adiabatic flame
temperature [102]. The hydrogen content has a significant impact
on increasing the tip temperature and, for constant hydrogen con-
centration, added CO content increases flashback propensity more
than added CH4.

previous data in the literature for a tube burner. A diffuser with rect-
angular cross section was considered and the lower diffuser wall
was adjustedD
X to the 4° slope. The flow was fully developed at the
burner exit.

PThe temperature of the lower diffuser wall was controlled by
impinging the air though three jets and monitored by three thermo-
couples.

PThe flame tip location in the boundary layer was captured by OH*
images. It was observed that the flame tip was strongly curved
towards the wall channel as previously indicated in Fig. 5. The criti-
cal velocity gradient was then calculated from the wall friction by
the Reynolds averaged numerical simulation (RANS) of a 2D model.

PThe final results are summarized in Table 7 for methane and
hydrogen at different mass flow rates. gc denotes the mean critical
velocity gradient calculated from the friction factor obtained by
numerical simulation. Another set of experiments were conducted
for each case to evaluate the effect of the wall heating on flashback
propensity.

PThe critical velocity gradient results for confined flames are sig-
nificantly higher than previous results in the literature for uncon-
fined flames. The critical velocity gradient of natural gas at
equivalence ratio of 0.8 in [77] was reported to be less 2000 1/s for
turbulent flame, which is three times smaller than the value
reported in Table 7 [97]. Such a significant difference reveals that
the flashback characteristic is influenced by the flame configuration
(i.e. confined and unconfined flames in Fig. 8).

PThe significantly different flashback limit for confined flames was
further studied by Eichler et al. [98] for hydrogen/air mixtures. A
setup similar to that shown in Fig. 63 was used [98]. The metal chan-
nel was followed by a ceramic tile and another ceramic block. Three

ration 3, two small steps are formed between the channel, tile, and

PAs mentioned earlier, the flashback propensity of confined flames
in a channel was significantly higher than the existing data for
unconfined tube burners. However, this was only validated for the
channel, and it was not clear if the confinement is the main reason
for such an increase. Hence, a confined flame was also studied in
[98] for a tube burner to compare results from both experiments. A
pilot burner made from brass was used to stabilize the flame. A
ceramic block was used above the pilot burner and caused the flame
to creep upstream along the ceramic wall and finally stabilized at
the burner rim, resembling the condition when the flame already
exists in the tube. The pilot burner surface was air cooled to keep the
temperature between 40 and 60 °C. Fully developed flow was not
achieved and consequently the velocity profile was verified by PIV
measurement and RANS simulations. It was verified that the velocity
gradient at the tube wall can be estimated by the Blasius correlation
in Eq. (8) with less than 4% error from the measured values.

PFig. 64 presents all results obtained for flashback limits in the
channel and tube burner at different equivalence ratios. The first key
observation is that the flashback data points of the unconfined tube
burner lie significantly lower than those for all confined cases. Fur-
thermore, the results for confined flames in either the channel or the
tube are qualitatively similar. These two observations suggest that
the higher flashback limit of confined flames is a result of different
flashback characteristics and can be verified by both channel and
tube burners.

PThe flashback limit of configuration 1 (recall Fig. 63) is gener-
ally higher for all ranges of equivalence ratio covered. The sec-
ond configuration with 0.5 mm step has a lower flashback limit
than the first configuration, but this difference vanishes as the

PFine [71,76] was similar to the previous work by the same group
carried out under laminar conditions [67]. Burner tubes of 0.546,
1.016, 1.459, and 1.890 cm diameters were used. The turbulent
flame speed was calculated by determining the mean flame sur-
face from the captured images as explained in [71,181]. The lon-
gitudinal velocity fluctuation was measured at the center of the
burner to find the range of Reynolds number at which the transi-
tion to turbulent flow occurred. This measurement was made in
the absence of the flame and the transition range was found to
be occurring between 1500 (cid:2) Re (cid:2) 2500. In addition, the flash-
back data show a clear transition from a laminar regime to the
turbulent regime at similar range of Reynolds numbers. The criti-
cal velocity gradient in transition regime was calculated using
the laminar approach in Eq. (5).

ratio of 0.95. The pressure exponents of the critical velocity gradient
(slope of solid lines in Fig. 65) are 1.28 and 1.22 for laminar and tur-
bulent flames, respectively. It was observed that the pressure expo-
nent remained approximately constant
for both laminar and
turbulent flames and it was independent of the burner diameter.
The average pressure exponent of critical velocity gradient for turbu-
lent flashback was 1.31, which is similar to the 1.35 § 0.08, previ-
ously found for laminar conditions (Section 4.3). The pressure value
stays constant at transitional region (horizontal dashed lines in
Fig. 65), while the Reynolds number is increased. The value of critical
velocity gradient corresponding to the transition regime increases
with a decrease in diameter. This transition for the diameter of 1.016
occurs at critical velocity gradient of 4000, which is higher than the
measured value for the cold flow.

PThe critical velocity gradient of the turbulent flames was found to
be approximately 2.8 times that of laminar flames [76]. Hence, the
constant coefficient in Eq. (33) (Section 4.3) is multiplied by this
value, resulting in 7.3 in the expression:

PThe comparison of the laminar and turbulent velocities indicated
that the ratio of turbulent burning velocity to the laminar burning
velocity is always less than 1.3 for this study. Consequently, an
increases in critical velocity gradient of turbulent flames is not solely
a result of higher flame speed. Indeed, the penetration distance of
turbulent flame also decreases according to the Eq. (48) and thus
also plays an important role in increasing flashback propensity for
turbulent conditions.

PFig. 66 illustrates the variation of critical velocity gradient for
hydrogen/20.6% oxygen-79.4% argon at equivalence ratio of 1.5. The

unconfined configurations [98].

Pequivalence ratio increases to 1. A few data points were obtained
for the configuration 3 with 2 mm step and the trend line indi-
cates a lower flashback propensity compared to 0.5 mm step.
Hence, an increase in step size decreases the flashback limit as
indicated in Fig. 64. For very lean conditions with equivalence
ratio less than 0.4, the flame did not flashback through the entire
channel and the flame oscillated between the intersection of
ceramic tile and steel block, so this was mentioned as a reason
for an offset of data points for three first sets. The flashback limit
of the channel with metal corner is similar to results for the
ceramic block and no clear difference was observed. It was also
noted that the flashback data of the metal corner was limited
due to observed thermoacoustic instabilities, which was a result
of lower surface temperature compared to the ceramic case.

PThe thermal coupling between the burner rim and flame front
plays an important role in boundary layer flashback of uncon-
fined flames. As a result, an increase in tip temperature can sig-
nificantly affect the boundary layer heating and triggering the
flashback. Burners constructed from different materials show
variation in flashback propensity limits when the burner is not
cooled. The presence of the flame enclosure increases the tip
temperature and consequently results in higher flashback pro-
pensity. Furthermore, a decrease of the enclosure size reduces
the heat loss to the ambient air and the entrainment of the fresh
oxidizer, leading to higher tip temperatures. The flashback pro-
pensity of confined flames is consistently higher than unconfined
flames as experimentally verified for flame propagation through
circular tubes and channels. The significant difference in flash-
back limit reveals that the flame-flow interaction near the wall-
region cannot be predicted by the critical velocity gradient con-
cept for confined flames. This observation has been the main
objective of recent numerical and experimental studies in the lit-
erature [99,100,106,108], discussed in Section 5.4.

5.3. Effect of operating pressure and preheat temperature

POnly a handful of studies of turbulent flashback propensity for
mixtures at elevated pressures have been reported in the litera-
ture. Edse carried out the first flashback experiments using a
Bunsen burner flame at pressures up to 100 atm for hydrogen/
oxygen mixtures [56]. The other few studies that exist are dis-
cussed in this section.

PThe effect of sub-atmospheric pressure on the flashback pro-
pensity of hydrogen was studied for laminar flow, transitional,
and turbulent flows by Fine [71,76]. Air and 20.6% oxygen-79.4%
argon were used as oxidizers in these experiments with hydro-
gen as the fuel and flashback propensity was examined for
equivalence ratios between 0.8 and 3. The experiment setup by

P0.546, 1.016, 1.459, and 1.890 cm were examined. The range of
equivalence ratio studied for propane/50% oxygen-50% nitrogen var-
ied between 0.6 and 1.45. Propane/oxygen and propane/20.6% oxy-
gen-79.4% argon were studied at equivalence ratios of 0.85 and 1,
respectively. Critical velocity gradient data were independent of the
burner diameter, except for the equivalence ratio larger than 1.25.

PThe laminar critical velocity gradient for propane/50% oxygen-
50% nitrogen peaked at the equivalence ratio of 1.05, while the maxi-
mum critical velocity gradient for turbulent flame was not observed
within the range of equivalence ratio studied.

Fig. 66. Critical velocity gradient of hydrogen/20.6% oxygen-79.4% argon as a function
of pressure at equivalence ratio of 1.5, reproduced from [76].

Ppressure exponent of critical velocity gradient is about 1.52 for tur-
bulent flames, which is equal to the value reported for the laminar
flame in [70] as discussed in Section 4.3.

PFig. 67 illustrates the variation of critical velocity gradient as a
function of
fuel percentage for hydrogen/air at different sub-
Xatmospheric pressures. For a given hydrogen concentration, the crit-
ical velocity gradient increases with an increase in pressure. Further-
more, the slope of critical velocity gradient variation increases with
an increases of pressure at lean and rich conditions. An important
observation is that the maximum critical velocity gradient is inde-
pendent of pressure and diluents, and remains constant at equiva-
lence ratio of 1.5. The laminar flame speed also peaks at the same
equivalence ratio of 1.5 according to [67] (see Fig. 26), stating that
the critical velocity gradient is proportional to the reaction rate.

PA similar study was conducted by Fine to examine the effect of
sub-atmospheric pressure on flashback propensity of propane/oxy-
gen, propane/50% oxygen-50% nitrogen, and propane/20.6% oxygen-
79.4% argon [70,76] using an experiment setup similar to their previ-
ous laminar studies [67,71]. The turbulent burning velocity was
determined based on the mean surface of the flame front as previ-
ously pointed out. Again, burner tubes with inner diameters of

and turbulent regimes. Laminar and turbulent flames showD

trend in logarithmic scales and the slope of these trends line (i.e.
pressure exponent) are equal to 1.17 and 1.22, respectively. Further-
more, the data obtained at different burner diameter lie on the same
line. In transition regime, the pressure remains constant (horizontal
dashed lines) while the Reynolds number is increased and the range
of Reynolds number found to be similar; 1500 (cid:2) Re (cid:2) 2500, as previ-
ously observed in [71]. The transition to the turbulent flow for the
burner diameter of 0.546 was not observed at pressures below one
atmosphere. At very low Reynolds numbers, the slope of critical
velocity gradient for the laminar flame drops below the slope of solid
line as indicated in Fig. 68. This is mainly due to the fact that the
velocity gradient cannot be calculated by the linear velocity profile
asD

PThe average pressure exponents of critical velocity gradient for
propane/50% oxygen-50% nitrogen in laminar and turbulent regimes
were 1.13 and 1.11, respectively. These values are slightly lower
than those of hydrogen flames as previously mentioned from [71].
For propane/oxygen, the pressure exponent of 1.4 was found for
both laminar and turbulent flames. Propane/20.6% oxygen-79.4%
argon data points were not sufficient to find the pressure exponent
under turbulent conditions, while the pressure exponent of 0.91 was
found for the laminar flames.

Xquenching effect is enhanced.

PUsing the measured burning velocity and quenching distance in
[182], the critical velocity gradient can be represented as the ratio of
the laminar burning velocity to the quenching distance. This ratio
for the laminar flame at equivalence ratio of 1 is written as:

found for the laminar hydrogen flames. The ratio of critical velocity

PThe effect of preheat temperature (300 to 620 K) and sub-atmo-
spheric pressure was studied by Fine [79]. Different fuels were
examined in this experiment including hydrogen/air, propane/oxy-
gen-nitrogen, ethylene/oxygen-nitrogen, and ethylene/air. Oxygen-
nitrogen mixture contains 50% oxygen and 50% nitrogen by volume.
A brass tube burner head with 1.016 cm in diameter was used. The
tip temperature was kept within § 10 K of the preheated gas tem-
perature. For high heating value mixtures (such as propane) at high
equivalence ratio, the tip temperature was higher than some low
preheat temperatures. Hence, the burner was connected to the
chamber to decrease the tip temperature through increasing the
conduction heat loss.

functions of pressure and temperature for hydrogen/air and eth-
ylene/air. Each figureD

Pmaximum. Flashback curves at a given preheat temperature are
divided into three sections including laminar (R < 1500), transi-
tion (1500 < Re < 2500), and turbulent regimes (Re > 2500). In
Fig. 69(a), dashed line represents the non-preheat data studied
in [70,71,76], obtained for water-cooled burner head. The room
temperature data in Fig. 69(b) represent the experimental results
from [49]. The pressure exponent of critical velocity gradient is
independent of preheat temperature for the different mixtures
studied. The trend line in Fig. 69(b) has some curvature for low
Reynolds numbers. This is due the enhanced flame quenching
effect at these particular conditions. The variation of the critical
velocity gradient as a function of preheat temperature is also
independent of pressure. The average temperature exponent of
critical velocity gradient, i.e. slope of the trend line in Fig. 69(a)
and Fig. 69(b), are 1.52 and 1.59, respectively.

PThe flashback propensity of hydrogen-carbon monoxide flames
was studied by Daniele at al. [95] at elevated pressures up to 15 atm.
H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO mixtures in equal volumetric concentration were studied at
equivalence ratios between 0.2 and 0.7. Fuel/D
Xair mixtures were pre-
heated between 577 K and 674 K and were injected into the combus-
tor by a pipe with the inner diameter of 25 mm. The complete
description of the high pressure facility used in this experiment can
be found elsewhere [95,183]. Flashback was approached by gradu-
ally increasing equivalence ratio while the preheat temperature and
pressure remained constant. Furthermore, mass flow rate was
adjusted to obtain a constant velocity for each set of data. Flashback
was controlled by both active and passive mechanisms. For passive
control, nitrogen gas was injected into the boundary layer of the
burner located 150 mm upstream of the injector outlet. The nitrogen
mass flow rate remained constant at 1% of the air flow rate for all
operating conditions such that the flame position was not affected in
significant manner.

PFig. 70 presents the equivalence ratio at which flashback occurs
as a function of pressure. The velocity at the burner head was kept
constant at 45, 60, and 65 m/s as labeled for each data set. An
increase in pressure for a given preheat temperature and velocity at
the burner head decreases the equivalence ratio at flashback signifi-
cantly, corresponding to increased flashback propensity. The depen-
dency of the equivalence ratio on the pressure can be represented by
fD
Xall pressure exponents in Fig. 70.
For a constant pressure and velocity, an increase in preheat tempera-
ture from 577 to 674 K decreases the equivalence ratio at flashback,
indicating higher flashback propensity.
It was noted that an
increases of injector velocity from 45 to 60 m/s has a small effect on
increasing flashback limit.

PThe turbulent burning velocity in this experiment was measured
using the global consumption approach and it was observed that an
increase in pressure had different impacts on turbulent flame speed
depending on equivalence ratio [95]. Close to the flashback limit, the
turbulent flame speed increases with an increase of pressure (pres-
sure exponent of 0.12). Since this dependency is weak, the turbulent
burning velocity alone cannot explain the significant increase in
flashback propensity with an increase of pressure. Indeed, it was
concluded that the dependency of D
X pressure is mainly
due to the quenching distance variation [95].

Xflashback onD

PLin et al. used the turbulent burning velocity to predict flashback
propensity of high hydrogen content fuels at high pressure [105].
The experiment was conducted with hydrogen rich fuel gases
including 70% H2-30% N2, 85% H2-15% N2, and pure hydrogen react-
ing with air. The bulk velocity at the injector and preheat tempera-
ture were kept constant at 40 m/s and 623 K, while the pressure was
varied up to 10 atm. The experiment setup was similar to the previ-
ous studies by that group [95]. The turbulent flame speed was calcu-
lated using the global consumption rate definition [17].

X to D

PLin et al. [105] observed that the flame length can be a good indi-
cation of flashback. Indeed, flashback occurred when the flame
Xtwice the diameter of the injector. Furthermore,
length reducedD
the turbulent velocity correlated well with the flame length. The
maximum turbulent burning velocity before flashback was on order
of 10 m/s, which was close to the flow velocity in premixing tube at
the boundary of viscous sublayer (y C D 5). As a result, the critical
velocity gradient was used to predict flashback propensity. The lami-
nar flame speed in Eq. (5) was replaced by the turbulent flame speed.
Based on previous conclusions in the literature, the penetration dis-
tance was estimated by the quenching distance, which is propor-
tional to the flame thickness (df) [52]. The final correlation proposed
by Lin et al. [105] to predict flashback limit is written as:
gc D ST
Le£df
PFlashback occurs when the velocity gradient of the flowD

X, esti-
mated by the Blasius correlation in Eq. (8), is equal to the value of gc.
Fully developed flow was not achieved in this experiment. Neverthe-
less, the velocity gradient of turbulent flow was calculated from
Eq. (8). Lewis number is used in Eq. (51) to capture the influence of
Xwas based on the observation that the
hydrogen in the mixture. This D
effect of Lewis number was significant on flashback propensity as
described in [90,92,94].

ð51Þ

PThe model by Lin et al. [105] (Eq. (51)) was evaluated against the
experimental flashback data for 50% H2-50% CO in [95]. The model
predicts the higher flashback propensity associated with higher pre-
heat temperatures and pressures. The comparison of experimental
results with predicted data shows a reasonable agreement in Fig. 71.

PIt should be noted that the experimental data were presented for
45 m/s, which is 5 m/s above the velocity of the predicted data.
Considering this fact, the predicted data points would be slightly
different.

PAnother experimental study of boundary layer flashback of a
2.54 cm diameter, fully developed premixed jet flame at gas turbine
premixer conditions was carried out by Kalantari et al. [110]. The
flashback propensity of hydrogen jet flames was investigated at ele-
vated pressures (3(cid:1)8 atm) and temperatures (300(cid:1)500 K). The range
of Reynolds number studied in this experiment was 5 £ 104 < ReD
X<
3 £ 105. Three burner materials including stainless steel, copper, and
zirconia ceramic were used to evaluate the effect of tip temperature
on flashback propensity. The tip temperature was measured by two
thermocouples located at the burner rim.

PAn increase in pressure causes higher flashback propensity and
flashback limits were found to be more sensitive to equivalence ratio
at higher pressures. Fig. 72 indicates the variation of equivalence
ratio as a function of pressure at different preheat temperatures and
injector bulk velocities. An increase in preheat temperature for a
given velocity increases the equivalence ratio at which flashback
occurs. The higher mass flow rates results in higher equivalence ratio
at flashback, but this cannot be used as an effective method to avoid

PThe variation of tip temperature as a function of equivalence ratio
is illustrated in Fig. 73 for different preheat temperatures and pres-
sures. Trend lines indicate the variation of flashback propensity cor-
responding to velocity change at the burner head. An increase in
preheat temperature for a given pressure increases the tip tempera-
ture at which flashback occurs, while the equivalence ratio at which
flashback occurs decreases. Indeed, the higher tip temperature is a
result of balance between an increase in preheat temperature and
the decrease in equivalence ratio. For constant mixture temperature,
an increase in pressure significantly decreases the equivalence ratio
at which flashback occurs, while increasing the tip temperature at
flashback. This observation is explained by considering the depen-
dency of the quenching distance on pressure. As the pressure
increases, the quenching distance decreases and consequently indu-

Xthe flashback propensity. Furthermore, the effect of tip tempera-
ture is enhanced with an increase of pressure. This observation is
consistent with the experimental study by Edse [56] for hydrogen/
oxygen mixture at high pressure. Edse observed significant scatter-
ing in flashback limits for a given condition at high pressure due to

parameters, Kalantari et al., developed a correlation based on Buck-
ingham Pi theorem [110] and calibrated using the experimental data

PLewis number is calculated based on the thermal diffusivity of

unburned preheat temperature, tip temperature, and operating
pressure are defined in three independent non-dimensional groups.
The developed correlation was used for the experimental results at
high pressure as well as the existing high pressure results for
H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO from [95], as depicted in Fig. 74. Furthermore, the applica-
tion of the correlation was evaluated for a commercial 65 kW micro
turbine generator [112]. The atmospheric pressure result is for a
combustor, removed from the engine, configuredD
Xto operate at atmo-
spheric pressure and various preheat temperatures (i.e. 300 to
700 K) [101,112]. The engine data were obtained for a commercial
engine operated at different engine loads. In both configurations,
studies were carried out with various amounts of hydrogen added to
either natural gas or carbon monoxide [112]. The predicted Dam-
k€ohler numbers are in good agreement with the experimental result
as indicated in Fig. 74.

PThe turbulent flashback propensity of a mixture increases at high
pressure as experimentally observed for various fuel compositions.
It is thus apparent that the laminar flame speed cannot be used to
determine the turbulent flashback limit and that the turbulent burn-
ing velocity is required to address the flame propagation at high
Reynolds number. However, as pointed out in Section 2.1, turbulent
burning velocity is a function of flow characteristics and can be
determined byD
Xdifferent definitions [22]. While the ratio of turbulent
burning velocity to laminar flame speed is considered a function of
pressure based on consumption speed and flame angle methods

Pmagnitude on pressure was found to be weak in several studies
[29,189,190]. Furthermore, the quenching distance decreases with
an increase of pressure and was found to be an influential parameter
for increased flashback propensity at high pressure.

5.4. Flame(cid:1)wall interaction in boundary layer flashback

PA large number of experimental studies have investigated bound-
ary layer flashback in the literature, primarily using the concept of
critical velocity gradient for interpreting final results. In addition, a
few numerical studies have been performed to study boundary layer
flashback in more detail, mainly limited to laminar conditions. Until
fairly recently, the underlying physics of the problem was based on
the model (by Lewis and Elbe [47]) neglecting flame-flow interac-
tion. However, the lack of experimental and numerical analyses
taking into account high spatial and temporal resolution are still
apparent. Section 5.4 discusses recent important studies having sig-
nificant contributions to understanding of boundary layer flashback.

P5.4.1. Confined flames

PThe confined flame situation refers to a condition in which the
flame already exists in the boundary layer within a tube or channel.
Flame can enter the premixing tube due to the operability issues
such as pressure, velocity fluctuations, and auto ignition as indicated
in Fig. 8. The turbulent flame propagation through a channel has
been studied experimentally and numerically with high spatial and
temporal resolutions, achieved by micro-resolution particle image
velocimetry (Micro-PIV) measurements and direct numerical simu-
lation (DNS). Since there is no mechanism for flame anchoring
through a channel, the flame rapidly propagate upstream [99,100].

PEichler and Sattelmayer investigated boundary layer flashback of
premixed flame for confined flames using simultaneous micro-PIV
and chemiluminescence measurements [99]. Flame-flow interaction
near the wall-region at the onset of flashback was studied in detail
and presented conclusion were also verified by the numerical simu-
lation of a laminar premixed flame stabilized on a flat plate using
ANSYS CFX [99]. As discussed in prior work [98], the critical velocity
gradient model cannot capture the characteristic of confined flames
and temporally and spatially resolved measurements were used in
this experiment to capture the onset of flashback. The setup used in
this experiment was similar to configuration 1 in Fig. 63. Both lami-
nar and turbulent flames for hydrogen and methane were investi-
gated in this study. The high spatial resolution required for
capturing the structure of the near-wall region for the turbulent

be seen from the black isoline of hydrogen molar fraction. As equiva-
lence ratio increases, the maximum height and length of back flow
region increases. The ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the back flow
region is a result of balance between the heat transfer from the flame
front, heat loss to the wall and external region. The height of back
flow region is considerably larger than the quenching distance. As
the maximum height of the back flow region reaches a certain value;
which is dictated by energy balance, the reaction can sustain itself
inside the back flow region and flashback occurs. The back flow
region at the onset of flashback is continuously moved upstream by
the adverse pressure in front of the flame.

PDirect numerical simulation of boundary layer flashback in fully
developed turbulent channel flow was carried out by Gruber et al
[100]. The turbulent flame-wall interaction was studied for hydro-
gen/air with detailed chemical mechanisms developed by Li etD
X al.
[193]. The simulation was obtained for Reynolds number of 3200
(friction Reynolds number, Ret D 180) based on the channel half
width, preheat temperature of 750 K, and equivalence ratio of 1.5.
The rich mixture was examined at pressures of 1 and 2 atm for chan-
nel half widths of 1 and 0.5 cm, respectively. The compressible Nav-
ier-Stokes equations were solved in three-dimensional domain
to simulate the freely propagation of non-anchored flame through
turbulent planner channel flow.

PFig. 77 indicates the upstream flame propagation inside the chan-
nel at different time steps. The laminar flame is initially present in
the flow field with alternating streaks in the near-wall region which
are the coherent structures of the turbulent boundary layer [194]. As
shown in Fig. 77, no back flow region is observed in the flow field ini-
tially simulated for the non-reactive mixture. Then, the high speed
sweeps causes the formation of flame cusps, i.e. the convex flame

PMie-scattering was also implemented to estimate the flame location
in captured images. The detailed description of micro PIV setup and
its alignments can be found in [99,191]. Since the channel length
was not long enough, the flow did not reach a fully developed state.
PFig. 75 presents the turbulent flame flashback behavior of hydro-
gen/air mixture by OH* chemiluminescence, Mie-scattering, and
velocity contour images. The highly stochastic behavior of the turbu-
lent flow is clear in Fig. 75 with presence of flame wrinkles. The con-
cave wrinkles are formed into cusps, which can either travel
upstream, move down stream, or stay at initial location. It was also
observed that cusps in 40(cid:1)50% of cases divided into new cusps,
going through the same process of moving or remainingD
X. The
upstream movement comprising high fraction of formed cusps leads
to the flame flashback. For first set of images at tD 0, the flame tip is
not located at the center of the channel (yellow line) and conse-
quently the flame did not appear in Mie-scattering image. In the
next three images, the flame location can be estimated by the low
density fluid. The white line represents the zero axial velocity in the
flow field and the formation of back flow region. The back flow
region was observed for cases in which the cups propagated
upstream; however, backflow was not formed as the cusps were
washed downstream of the flame. The boundary layer separation
was also observed for laminar flashback of methane/air flames.

PThis experiment shed some new light on the flame-flow interac-
tion at the onset of flashback. An increase of pressure upstream of
the flame front leads to the flow separation observed for both lami-
nar and turbulent flames for studied cases. Hoferichter et al. recently
developed a flashback prediction model for confined flames based
on the separation of the turbulent boundary layer [111].

PThe boundary layer separation was further verified by numerical
simulation of a laminar flame. In this model, the hydrogen/air mix-
ture was stabilized on a flat plate with a hot wall segment used as a
flame holder. The temperature of the mixture and the flat plate were
kept constant at 293.15 K. The laminar premixed combustion was
modeled by finite-rate chemistry with five species and three steps
mechanisms based on Boivin et al. [192]. Full description of the
implemented method can be found in [99].

PAn increase of pressure upstream of the flame front is a result of
two dimension characteristics of the flame-flow interaction and was
not predicted in simplified numerical models existing in the litera-
ture. The convex flame bulge towards reactants in the boundary
layer results in the adverse pressure gradient and flow deceleration,
which can potentially leads to the flow separation (see [138],
chapter 7).

Psuppresses the formation of back flow region; as a result, the LES
may not be able to capture the structure of flame-flow interaction in
the near-wall region.

P5.4.2. Unconfined flames

PIn premixed combustors, the flame is generally stabilized down-
stream of the injector/premixer duct where the fuel/air mixture
enters the combustion chamber with a larger cross sectional area.
This sudden expansion is limited to the liner diameter, which is typi-
cally much larger than the premixer duct diameter. As this expan-
sion ratio increases, the combustor resembles the case with free
injection of the combustible mixture to the ambient air (Fig. 8).
Boundary layer flashback of jet flames has been extensively studied
in the literature, but the detailed characteristics of the problem have
not been well understood. The lack of numerical simulation address-
ing boundary layer flashback of jet flames is noted. Besides, all
experimental studies in the literature are limited to investigating
the flashback limits, in which the critical velocity gradient is used for
comparison.

PIn order to the characterize the flame-flow interaction at the
onset of flashback for unconfined jet flames, an experimental inves-
tigation at atmospheric pressure was conducted by Baumgartner
et al. [106]. The high speed PIV, micro-PLIF along with chemilumi-
nescence imaging were used to capture the spatial and temporal var-
iations of the propagating hydrogen flame. The D
Xexperimental setup
includes a high aspect ratio rectangular channel to resemble a two-
dimensional flow through a planner channel. The flame is stabilized
downstream of the burner exit to the ambient air.

PSimultaneous OH* Chemiluminescence was used along the PIV or
PLIF measurements. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the
propagating flame were captured by the implemented high fre-
quency lasers and long-distance microscopes. Further details of the
laser diagnostics setup, measurement, and post processing of the
data are found in [106].

PFig. 79 presents the axial velocity contour with the propagation of
the flame front at the onset of flashback for the bulk velocity of 7 m/s,
equivalence ratio of 0.5, and temperature of the 293 K. The six
images with the time interval of 0.33 ms show the flashback begin-
ning and propagation of the flame front in which streamlines are
indicated by white lines. The streamlines near the wall-region are
highly deflected toward the expansion region, which is not observed
for a jet flow without the reaction. The black dashed line in Fig. 79
represent the approximate flame front location extracted from Mie
scattering images. As the equivalence ratio is increased to the critical
value, the leading flame tip is formed close to the edge of the lower

Pregion towards the products, while the low speed ejections lead to
the formation of bulges, i.e. the convex flame towards the reactants
(upstream leading edge in Fig. 77). Darrieus-Landau hydrodynamic
instability [195] induced by this mechanism enhances the interac-
tion between the turbulent boundary layer and premixed flame.
Consequently, the backflow region is generated upstream of the
bulges shown by blue surfaces in Fig. 77. Indeed, these back flow
pockets are results of the fluid expansion across the flame front
occurring at the low-speed streaks locations.

PThese reverse flow regions are located near the wall with y C < 20
and extended up to 60(cid:1)70 wall units in upstream direction. The
height of backflow region reported in the experimental study by
Eichler is y C D 25 to 30 [196]. The upstream propagation speed of
the leading-edge flame is significantly enhanced by the presence of
backflow pockets facilitating flashback. This is according to signifi-
cantly higher critical velocity gradients associated with confined
flames as shown in Fig. 64 [98]. Fig. 78 illustrates the streamwise
velocity contour with location of the flame front (white line) relative
to the backD
Xflow region. The maximum negative velocity magnitude
is u C » ¡5 or half of the laminar flame speed (Fig. 78) and located at
the wall distance of y C D 9, which matches well to the position of
the upstream leading edge flame. It is noted that the flame is
quenched at y C D 2, which is much smaller than the height of back
flow region.

PIt was observed that the size of back flow region and the maxi-
mum strength of negative streamwise velocity are influenced by the
mesh resolution of the boundary layer. Indeed, the course mesh

Pwall and starts propagating upstream. With upstream propagation of
leading flame, the flow decelerates as colored by red region in
Fig. 79. The upstream flame propagation through the duct enhances
the reactants deceleration and can eventually lead to the boundary
layer separation as previously observed from the experimental
results for confined flames. This behavior isD
Xnot observed in Fig. 79
since the flame is partially confined by the lower wall.

PThe flame propagation in boundary layer flashback of an uncon-
fined flame is not triggered by the immediate jump of the flame into
the burner. Indeed, it initially starts with the formation of the lead-
ing flame front close to the wall appearing as a strongly curved flame
tip towards the unburned mixture. This behavior is depicted with
the schematic of flashback occurrence in Fig. 80. The part of the
flame anchored below the wall remains approximately undisturbed
as the flame propagates upstream. The distance from the wall where
the leading flame tip propagates is indicated by df and is approxi-
mately equal to 1 mm as reported in [106], which is in good agree-
ment with the measured values (0.53(cid:1)0.96 mm) for a confined
flame in [196].

PBased on this observation, a prediction model was proposed
in [106]. Flashback starts at distance of sf from the burner rim,
which is larger than the head-on quenching distance (dq) as illus-
trated in Fig. 80. At this location (sf), the burning velocity is
equal to the flow velocity providing the proper condition for the
flame propagation. Based on experimental results, the streamline
passing from the location (sf) coincides with the distance (yf)
from the channel wall, which is slightly lower than the distance
df in Fig. 80. Assuming the axial velocity distribution inside the
channel at the onset of flashback is not affected by the stable
flame anchored downstream of the burner rim, the prediction
model was proposed as following:
(cid:7) (cid:8)
/ u yf

(cid:7) (cid:8)
D u sf

ð54Þ

Sf sf

(cid:7) (cid:8)

PThis equation states that the prediction of boundary layer flash-
back for unconfined flames is a function of the undisturbed velocity
profile of the flow inside the channel. Experimental results showed
that the distance (yf) is between 0.6 and 0.7 mm and almost indepen-
dent of equivalence ratio. This range of (yf) corresponds to y C D 13
and y C D 21 and falls within the buffer layer region, while the critical
velocity gradient model assumption is that the flow velocity at flash-
back can be approximated by the linear velocity profile in the vis-
cous sublayer. Hoferichter et al. further developed this flashback
prediction model by assuming that the location at which flashback is
triggered corresponds to the maximum streamwise turbulence
intensity in a fully developed duct flow. This model includes a bal-
ance between the local turbulent burning velocity and the local flow
velocity at y C D 16.4 [109].

PThe flame-flow interaction in unconfined configurations at the
onset of flashback does not significantly impact the upstream
flow field. As a result, the velocity profile remains approximately
undisturbed upstream of the anchored flame. This is the main

Preason why the concept of critical velocity gradient has been
able to predict various data in the literature for the onset of
flashback. The presence of backflow region has been experimen-
tally observed and numerically verified for both laminar and tur-
bulent flame propagation through a channel. But, it is important
to realize that the backflow region occurs only if the necessary
conditions are met. Otherwise, the presence of backflow pockets
cannot be generally extended to all fuel compositions and oper-
ating conditions. Indeed, the flame expansion ratio needs to be
large enough compared to the fluid velocity close to the wall,
which determines the flow retardation in that region.

5.5. Key points and status

P(cid:3) Flashback limit is dictated by the turbulent boundary layer
structure and the critical velocity gradient concept is less able to
capture flashback behavior of turbulent flames compared to
laminar flames. This is due in part to the breakdown of assump-
tions underlying the theory such as linear velocity profiles and
no consideration of turbulent flame characteristics.

P(cid:3) The role of heat transfer between the flame and the burner is
similar to that in laminar flames. The net result is strong interac-
tions between parameters that affect heat transfer such as flame
temperature and proximity of the flame to the burner. The
boundary layer heating can potentially lead to the flow separa-
tion in the boundary layer, inducing the upstream flame propa-
gation. As a result, incorporation of key heat transfer effects is
required to generalize any predictive model for capturing flash-
back tendencies.

P(cid:3) Work done on turbulent configurations underscores the impor-
tance of considering which regime the flame is in, whether it be
unconfined or confined. It is evident that once the flame transi-
tions from outside the premixer tube to within it, the propaga-
tion rate greatly increases. If the flame issues into an enclosure
(e.g., a combustor), the impact on flow field and heat transfer
again impacts the flashback behavior. Thus applying models
based on open flames may not provide accurate results for
flames issuing into an enclosure.

P(cid:3) More work has been carried on the pressure effect on turbulent
flame flashback than for laminar flames. Increased flashback
propensity at high pressure is a result of higher turbulent burn-
ing velocity and lower quenching distance. But, the contribution
of each parameter to the overall trend (i.e. flashback as a func-
tion of pressure) is not well understood due to limited studies at
high pressure.

P(cid:3) Some success in capturing these complex interactions has been
found recently using Buckingham Pi theory as applied to data
available over a range of fuel types, burner materials, operating
pressure, and reactant temperatures (e.g., [110,112]). A limita-
tion of the approach is that the heat transfer effects are captured
by the burner tip temperature which is really a culmination
of many other factors associated with the overall heat transfer
process.

P(cid:3) Recent insights into the behavior of confined turbulent flames
has established a new framework to develop new theories and
models for addressing flame propagation in these cases. These
insights have been established with both detailed experiments
(e.g., [99,104]) and high fidelity simulations (e.g., [100]). New
approaches have been developed in light of these insights (e.g.,
[111]).

Fig. 80. Schematic of flame front transition from the stable condition to flashback
[106].

P(cid:3) The presence of backflow region for boundary layer flashback of
confined flames has been observed. The backflow region occurs
only if the flame expansion ratio is large enough compared to
the fluid velocity in the near-wall region of a channel.

6. Closing remarks and recommendations

References

PBoundary layer flashback has been studied since the 19400s. The
effects of various parameters including fuel/oxidizer composition,
preheat temperature, operating pressure, burner material, and geo-
metrical burner configuration under laminar and turbulent condi-
tions have been examined. The concept of a critical velocity
gradient, neglecting the flame-flow interaction, has been used fre-
quently in the literature to interpret experimental results. The
transition of the stabilized flame at burner rim to the injector
(unconfined configuration) has been addressed by numerous
researchers, while the flame propagation through circular tubes or
channels (confined configuration) has been the subject of both
experimental and numerical simulations in the literature. These two
regimes feature fundamentally different phenomenological behavior
as discussed in Section 5.4. Recent experimental and numerical stud-
ies of confined flames have been particularly illuminating.

PLaminar boundary layer flashback has been extensively studied
in the literature for various fuel compositions (Sections 4). However,
studies carried out for turbulent boundary layer flashback are lim-
ited (Section 5), especially those featuring numerical simulations.
Numerical modeling of the flame-wall
interaction for laminar
boundary layer flashback has mainly focused on two-dimensional
analysis using single-step chemical reaction mechanism. It is also
noted that the most recent research have emphasized flashback pro-
pensity of high hydrogen content fuels and syngas fuels.

PIt is apparent that more studies are required at gas turbine pre-
mixer conditions to investigate the effect of pressure and high Rey-
nolds numberD
Xon flashback propensity. The effect of pressure can be
isolated by controlling the burner rim temperature under conditions
of interest. Such effects have not been studied at elevated pressure.
In addition, laser diagnostic techniques such PIV, PLIF, and flame
spectroscopy can be implemented to provide a better understanding
of boundary layer flashback at high pressures.

PThe effect of turbulence intensity on flashback propensity, espe-
cially at elevated pressure, has not yet been studied in the literature.
The strategy to alter the turbulence of the air/fuel mixture has
proven difficult in narrow ducts as the fully developed flow needs to
be attained, but with varying turbulence. It is noted that no numeri-
cal simulation has been conducted for the transition of the turbulent
stabilized flame at burner rim to the injector as flashback occurs.
Indeed, the numerical simulation addressing flame-wall interaction
using detailed chemical kinetics for unconfined configurations is still
required. These open questions warrant further work, but progress
has been made in terms of design tool development as well as
phenomenological understanding of the boundary layer flashback
mechanism.
