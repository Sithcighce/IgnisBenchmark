Thermal hazards of reactive chemicals have been a major concern due to the unceasing occurrences of
fire and explosion accidents in industry. Understanding thermal threats of these chemicals not only con-
tributes to the process safety and sustainability in the research and development (R&D) level, but pro-
motes the efficiency of loss prevention, firefighting and emergency responses. Numerous studies have
been conducted towards the comprehensive assessment of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals. The
chemicals and methods varied in these studies, and yet some topics were commonly concerned by re-
searchers in relevant fields. Further to say, these topics should also be targeted at when dealing with
thermal hazards of new chemicals in future. This article provides an up-to-date overview of the com-
mon ground regarding the comprehensive understanding of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals in in-
dustry level; whereby, the main limitations and challenges to be faced are explored. The discussed key
points include, the classification and reactivity of typical reactive chemicals, the fundamental steps to-
wards the comprehensive understanding of their thermal hazards (including the identification of reaction
mechanisms, the calculation of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, and the characterization of ther-
mal safety properties), and the applicable theoretical, experimental and engineering approaches in each
step. The primary goal of this review is to lay out the essential basics that should be focused in every trial
to comprehensively understand the thermal hazards of reactive chemicals. The further research directions
are also presented based on the current research gaps and the context of Industry 4.0.

1. Introduction

Due to the boom of modern chemical industry since the 19th
century, numerous chemicals have been developed. Chemical sub-
stances with potential adverse effects on people, property and en-
vironment are generally known as “hazardous materials”. The term
of “reactive chemicals” refers to a category  of hazardous chemi-
cals initiating chemical reactions by themselves or with other sub-
stances  [1] .  These  reactions  are  often  exothermic  and  can  pro-
duce  flammable  gases  and/or  explosive  products  to  trigger  ac-
cidents  with  severe  consequences.  Reactivity  of  these  chemicals
can  be  driven  by  friction,  shock,  electrostatic  charge  and  heat,
and  so  on.  Among  these  factors,  thermal  related  reactivity  is
of  great  concern  to  the  fire  protection  community.  A  review  of
319  major  industrial  accidents  occurred  from  1917  to  2011  in-
dicated  that,  three  cases  including  fire,  explosion  and  toxic  re-
lease dominated the accidents in industry [2] . Primary cases could
have  secondary  effects.  For  example,  fires  were  often  followed
by explosions and vice versa. A large number of fire and explo-
sion  accidents  have  occurred  in  chemical  facilities,  plants,  ware-
houses, and industrial parks or during transport, primarily due to
the uncontrolled thermal runaway incidents of reactive chemicals
[2–4] .

Although  the  total  number  of  major  industrial  accidents  has
been decreasing in recent years [2] , fire and explosion incidents
and accidents are still of great challenge to the industry communi-
ties for their catastrophic consequences once happened. For exam-
ple, a major fire and explosion accident [5–7] occurred at a con-
tainer storage station of Tianjin Port, China in 2015. This accident
caused 165 deaths, 798 injuries, over 6 billion financial losses, dis-
astrous influence on community, and severe pollution to the en-
vironment. The initial fire and explosion was caused by an over-
heated container for nitrocellulose (NC), which is an energetic ma-
terial  with  spontaneous  combustion  hazard.  A  followed-by  more
dramatic explosion occurred, mainly due to the detonation of 800
tons of ammonium nitrate (AN). Due to a large amount of other
reactive chemicals stored in the same area, fires continued to burn
uncontrollably and finally led to 8 additional explosions in the in-
dustrial park. This accident has drawn high attention from the in-
dustry communities due to its dramatic consequences in the con-
temporary era. It is apparent that the thermal hazards of NC, AN,
as well as other reactive chemicals were under-estimated in indus-
trial level, and there was no effective response plan for the poten-
tial thermal runaway.

Back to the very beginning, the lack of accurate understanding
of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals is a major cause of al-
most all the fire and explosion accidents in modern industry [8–
10] .  Fig.  1  explains  how  the  thermal  hazards  of  reactive  chemi-
cals can contribute to thermal runaway incidents and the followed-
by fire and explosion accidents under a general chemical applica-
tion scenario. Apparently, accurate understanding of chemicals is a
prerequisite for their sustainable use at the R&D stage. Scientific

knowledge of their thermal hazards can also enable the prediction
of unfolded consequences if chemicals are exposed to thermal en-
vironment, and thus help with emergency response in industrial
parks [11] . Note that the inherent property of chemicals and mix-
tures is not the only factor that contribute to fire and explosion.
A thermal runaway process is generally governed by three factors
[12] , the heat generation due to reaction (influenced by mass of
reactive mixture and reactor size), the heat exchange with envi-
ronment (such as the surface of reactor), and the internal heat and
mass transfer (such as the physical state of substances and ther-
mophysical properties).

Many  researchers  and  engineers  in  fields  of  chemistry,  fire
and  explosion,  process  safety  and  loss  prevention  need  to  deal
with chemicals containing potential thermal threats constantly. The
comprehensive  understanding  of  their  thermal  threats  is  a  chal-
lenging target due to the complex coupling of both inherent prop-
erty  and  environment  conditions.  Numerous  studies  have  been
conducted  theoretically  and/or  experimentally  to  investigate  the
thermal hazards of the big reactive chemical family. We have ana-
lyzed existing studies regarding this topic in the last three decades,
and identified the common ground that has been highly focused.
Despite the varieties in chemicals and application scenarios, there
were some fundamental actions towards the purpose of compre-
hensive  thermal  hazard  assessment.  The  thermal  reactivity  of  a
chemical  must  be  fully  understood  through  a  series  of  physico-
chemical parameters. The potential thermal threats of a chemical
such as thermal stability, flammability, explosiveness and ignitabil-
ity  (by  self-heating  or  external  energy)  should  be  quantitatively
characterized. A reactive chemical should also be properly classi-
fied on basis of the reactivity phenomena and potential hazards
for storage or transport purposes.

To  the  knowledge  of  the  authors,  there  is  no  state-of-the-art
review  article  with  regard  to  the  aforementioned  actions,  which
should also be the key points towards the comprehensive under-
standing of thermal hazards of new chemicals in future. This pa-
per does not intend to target at a particular form of thermal haz-
ard or a certain kind of chemical. The fundamental purpose of this
article is to present the issues of interest regarding the common
ground with up-to-date discussions, and to provide a guideline for
potential users to handle the thermal hazards of a new chemical.
Some new perspectives are also presented to fill in the current re-
search gaps. Note that the term of thermal hazard technically dif-
fers from thermal risk. The term of risk or the likelihood of harm
occurring is introduced when exposure is considered in conjunc-
tion with the data of potential hazards [12] . This article mainly fo-
cuses on the extensive studies related to the thermal hazards of re-
active chemicals; nevertheless some contents of thermal risks are
also covered due to the intimate relations between hazard identi-
fication and risk assessment in industry. It is expected that this re-
view will provide values to readers in relevant fields by seeing the
whole picture, and bring helps to investigate the thermal threats
of reactive chemicals in future.

2. Classification and thermal characteristics of reactive
chemicals

2.1. Brief of chemical classifications by different authorities

The classification of chemicals is to analyze the hazard related
data of a chemical by deciding whether the chemical should be
classified as hazardous, and which kind of hazard is covered by the
chemical. Depending on the nature of the hazards, different hazard
classes can be defined. For example, flammable solids have phys-
ical hazards, and carcinogen can cause health hazards. The iden-
tification of hazard class is fundamental to conveniently manage
chemicals in industry. When it comes to reactive chemicals or mix-
tures, a proper classification on basis of their reactivity is essen-
tial to achieve the purpose of safe handling, processing, storage,
transport or placing on the market. Such requirements were also
highly included in the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authoriza-
tion, and Restriction of Chemicals) regulations regarding the infor-
mation collection and assessment on the properties and hazards of
substances in European Union (EU) [13] .

The classification of chemicals has been studied for quite a long
time. Different understandings in chemical reactivity led to the va-
riety in classification. Till now, two classification schemes proposed
by the United Nations (UN) have been widely applied internation-
ally, i.e. the so-called Orange Book and Purple Book. Early in the
1950s, a series of recommendations was developed under the um-
brella of the United Nation Economics and Social Council’s Com-
mittee of Experts for the Transport of Dangerous Goods towards
the classification, labeling, packaging, and segregation of dangerous
goods. Relevant regulations and recommendations were tentatively
harmonized in the Orange Book entitled “Recommendations on the
Transport  of  Dangerous Goods” (UN  TDG).  Currently  it consists  of

two volumes, the Model Regulations with latest edition (20th) in
2019 [14] and the Manual of Tests and Criteria with latest edition
(6th) in 2015 [15] . The Orange Book has been addressed to govern-
ments and international organizations concerned with safety in the
transport of dangerous goods, and regularly amended and updated
in response to the development of technology and the changing
needs of users. The UN DTG applied physical hazards of chemicals,
particularly the explosibility and flammability as the main criteria
for classification. Nine classes were defined with some divisions, as
listed in Table 1 .

The  classification  by  UN  TDG  contributed  to  the  harmoniza-
tion of classification and labeling of chemicals as dangerous goods
in the transport sector regarding their physical hazards. However,
there  were  still  many  systems  of  classification  and  labeling  of
chemicals under different regularity regimes (e.g. work safety, en-
vironment protection, and consumer protection). For all the other
situations  than  transport,  the  objective  of  global  harmonization
was highlighted by the Economic and Social Council towards the
international mandate at the 1992’s United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED). The conference proposed
an agenda that “a globally harmonized hazard classification and com-
patible labeling system, including material safety data sheets and eas-
ily understandable symbols, should be available, if feasible, by the year
20 0 0 ”. A decade of work with regard to this mandate contributed
to the Purple Book entitled “Globally Harmonized System of Classi-
fication and Labeling for Chemicals (GHS)” [16] . The UN GHS, with
latest edition (8th) in 2019 developed a harmonized criterion for
substances and mixtures on basis of their physical, health and en-
vironment hazards. Referring to the nature of hazards, 17 physical
hazard classes, 10 health hazard classes and 2 classes of hazards
to environment were involved. Within each hazard class, a term of
“hazard category” (i.e. the division of criterion) in forms of num-

A summary of the physical hazard classes and corresponding haz-

[22] ,  and  the  OSHA  Hazard  Communication  Standard  (HCS)  and
so on.

As two most popular international classification systems, both
UN DTG and UN GHS recommendations [14–16] have been adopted
by  many  developed  and  developing  countries  and  authorities  to
their national legislation or standards, such as the implementation
of  GHS  by  the  Classification,  Labeling  and  Packaging  (CLP)  Reg-
ulation  within  all  EU  members  [17] ,  the  catalogue  of  Hazardous
Chemicals with GHS classifications in China [18 , 19] , the GHS Clas-
sification  Results  by  Japanese  Ministries  [20] ,  the  Industry  Code
of  Practice  on  Chemicals  Classification  and  Hazard  Communica-
tion  (ICOP)  in  Malaysia  [21] ,  the  European  Agreement  concern-

Besides,  there  are  other  classification  systems  deserved  to  be
mentioned.  The  U.S.  Chemical  Safety  and  Hazard  Investigation
Board  (CSB)  simply  classifies  reactive  materials  into  three  types,
self-reacting  chemicals,  chemicals  react  with  common  contami-
nants,  and  energetic  materials  [23] .  The  United  State  National
Fire  Protection  Association  (NFPA)  400  entitled  “Hazardous  ma-
terials  code ” [24]  divides  reactive  chemicals  into  seven  branches
according  to  their  physical  hazards,  which  are  unstable  reac-
tive  solids/liquids/gases,  water  reactive  solids/liquids/gases,  ox-
idizer  (solids/liquids/gases),  pyrophoric  solids/gases,  flammable

solid, organic peroxide (solids/liquids), and flammable/combustible
solids/liquids/gases. The US Coast Guard CHRIS system involves 24
categories according to the potential reactions of chemicals [25] .
The NFPA 704 hazard diamond (with latest edition of 2017) enti-
tled “Standard System for the Identification of Hazards of Materials
for Emergency Response ” [26] applies 4 categories to label danger-
ous substances for transport, i.e. health hazard, flammability haz-
ard, instability (reactivity) hazard and special hazards. The simple-
to-use character has made NFPA 704 one of the most popular sys-
tems  for hazards classification and ranking. The severity of haz-
ard is presented by a numerical rating ranging from 0 (least haz-
ardous) to 4 (most hazardous). The NFPA 400 [24] applies a 9 divi-
sion based classification according to the chemical’s reactivity, in-
cluding  acids,  alcohols,  alkyl  halides,  cyanides,  isocyanates,  met-
als,  nitrogen  halogen  compounds,  oxyanion  and  peroxides.  More
detailed classification could be accessed in the Chemical Reactiv-
ity Worksheet (CRW) database and the CAMEO Chemical software,
both  offered by the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration (NOAA) [27–29] . They divide over thousands of chemicals
into 68 reactive groups belonging to 14 categories, namely acids,
bases, boron compounds, carbon compounds, halogen compounds,
metals/neutral salts, nitrogen compounds, oxidizing agents, oxygen
compounds, phosphorus compounds, reducing agents, silicon com-
pounds, sulfur compounds and other.

2.2. Discussions on the chemical classifications by United Nation

Typical  forms  of  reactivity  that  may  lead  to  thermal  hazards
mainly include flammability, explosivity potential, oxidability, py-
rophoricity, self-heating properties, water-reactivity, self-reactivity
and  organic  peroxide  family  belonging.  It  is  apparent  that  these
forms  of  reactivity  and  the  corresponding  underpinning  phe-
nomenology were applied as primary basis for the classification of
chemicals by regulations of both UN TDG [14 , 15] and UN GHS [16] ,
as presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. Comparing to TDG,
GHS  further  refined  the  reactivity  with  a  more  detailed  classifi-
cation. For example, the substances with spontaneous combustion
hazards (corresponding to division 4.2 under TDG) were divided by
GHS into three different hazard classes, including pyrophoric solid,
pyrophoric liquid, and self-heating substances and mixtures. The
major  difference  between  pyrophoricity  and  self-heating  is  that
self-heating  substances  will  ignite  only  when  they  are  stored  in
large amounts (kilograms) and after long periods of time (hours or
days). However, the term of pyrophoric is not commonly used in
existing literatures because the boundary between the two terms
must be known through standard experiments. Please note that the
hazard classes and divisions defined by UN were all proposed on
basis of the conventions setting thresholds limits of standard safety
parameters  and  official  testing  procedures,  which  were  summa-
rized in the Manual of Tests and Criteria [15] . When applying both
UN  GHS  and  UN  TDG  regulations  for  classification,  users  should
know that whatever defaults the official testing procedures for the
targeted safety parameter may have, the procedures in the man-
ual should prevail over other testing procedures developed by the
scientific community, unless at some stage these emerging testing
procedures are introduced in the manual and relevant updates of
official documents.

The existing regulation schemes define notably the classes of
dangerous  substances  according  to  their  physical  hazards,  which
actually  are  implicitly  most  types  of  reactivity  that  chemicals
may  entail  with  few  exceptions.  Although  a  majority  of  hazard
classes  were  defined  on  basis  of  a  particular  reactivity  as  listed
in Tables 1 and 2 , it does not mean that the substances of haz-
ard class only have the particular reactivity. Since UN GHS requires
that all the hazards of a chemical should be assigned and com-
municated,  there  is  no  prioritization  of  hazards  under  the  sce-

nario that certain hazard class is not applicable or should not be
assigned  just  because  another  one  has  been  assigned.  This  may
lead to some traps and pitfalls when classifying the physical haz-
ards, since some physical and chemical factors may preclude the
simultaneous assignment of certain physical hazard class. For ex-
ample, lots of flammable solids also have self-reactive properties;
aerosols have both flammability and pressure hazards; some oxi-
dizing solids also present explosive hazards when they are stored
in large quantities. In summary, a chemical or chemical group may
be listed under more than one hazard class or category due to the
similarities in chemical structure and reactions. Therefore, the im-
plementation of both UN TDG and UN GHS could be challenging
with regard to the classification of chemicals with complicated re-
activity and various physical hazards.

Under the course of the implementation of both UN TDG and
UN  GHS  [14–16]  by  more  and  more  countries  across  the  world,
as  well  as  the  wide  application  by  industry,  the  combination  of
hazard  classes  has  been  placed  on  the  agenda.  A  recent  work
regarding  the  combination  of  physical  hazard  classes  under  UN
GHS was conducted by Wilrich et al. [30] , who proposed a cross-
classification outline with Fig. 2 . Apparently, the relations among
thermally hazardous substances in the big reactive chemical family
are quite intricate and complex, and thus the problem that phys-
ical hazard classes might be assigned simultaneously to a chemi-
cal is not trivial. Effective strategies should be developed for both
classification and testing on basis of the outlined combinations of
physical hazards.

Problems may also generate when the regulations of both UN
TDG  and  UN  GHS  are  translated  by  other  authorities  or  used
together  with  other  regulations.  Although  the  classifications  of
UN  GHS  and  UN  TDG  are  based  on  the  same  criterion  and  test
method, some principles of the two systems may differ from ex-
isting regulations, and result in additional classifications. Wilrich
et  al.  [17]  discussed  this  topic  with  regard  to  the  physical  haz-
ard classes under EU GLP and UN GHS, their intricate interfaces to
transport and former EU legislation. They concluded that, “available
physical  hazard  classifications  for  the  transport  of  dangerous  goods
and according to the former EU system can be used as available infor-
mation when classifying according to the GHS. However, the interfaces
of these classification systems and their limitations have to be under-
stood well when concluding on GHS/CLP classifications. This applies
not only to industry when applying CLP but especially to legislators
when adapting legislation that in one way or another refers to the
classification of chemicals .”

Another potential limitation for use in terms of reactivity haz-
ard assessment is that, the existing hazard classes by UN were de-
fined with conventional threshold values that have been tentatively
harmonized at world level with some success. This has been done
for all the hazard classes. Such harmonization of convention was
of  course  necessary  for  their  operational  use  through  regulation
for major chemical hazard control, but by the way, setting limits
for hazard classes does not mean there is no activity of the chem-
ical which just lies over the limit. For example, one liquid having
a flash point up to 60 °C (the limit of category 3 for flammable
liquids in the GHS [16] and in the EU CLP) is considered as dan-
gerous because it is rated by these regulations as a flammable liq-
uid. Based on the defined convention, another liquid with a flash
point  of  61  °C  would  not  be  included  in  the  CLP  as  flammable
liquid,  whilst  having  however  very  close  flammability  properties
and potential hazards. In addition, this liquid would be considered
as flammable liquid of category 4, for countries such as US and
Canada that have considered class 4 as flammable liquids. This in-
dicates the limits due to the threshold values set by pure “conven-
tion”. Such issues are not only limited to the flammable liquids,
but to all the hazard classes which applies the pure “convention”
as threshold values to define the hazard class.

The aforementioned issues highlight the importance of global
harmonization of classification and labeling of chemicals. A thor-
ough harmonization not only refers to the combination of classes
involved in different regulations, but the consistencies in the defi-
nition and description of reactivity, ranking system of hazard cat-
egory, testing procedures, criteria and solution to the pure “con-
vention” issues in a global level. Taking the UN GHS’s hazard cat-
egory listed in Table 2 as an example, there are three hazard cat-
egory ranking forms (number, letter or group). The basic princi-
ple is that, hazard category with 1 or A has greater hazards than
that with 2 or B. This is consistent with the OSHA’S rating sys-
tem where 1 is the most severe hazard and 4 is the least severe
hazard.  However  it  is  the  exact  opposite  of  NFPA  704  where  0
refers to the least level of hazard and 4 represents the most haz-
ardous level [26] . Such inconsistency may lead to potential confu-
sion for untrained users. More consistent ranking systems by term
of medium, low, high might make it more convenient for applica-
tion. The thorough harmonization of classification regulations may
be challenging, but study-worthy in order to meet the global im-
plementation trend [31] . Relevant committees and authorities, such
as the International Group of Experts on the Explosion Risks of Un-
stable Substances (IGUS) [32] should put this topic on agenda. As
a group of international experts, IGUS aims to exchange informa-

tion on the behavior of unstable substances and improve safety in
production, storage, transport, and use of these substances. They
have  been  working  in  close  collaboration  of  international  bod-
ies  in  charge  of  improving  recognition  of  reactive  chemical  and
the way to evaluate their relating thermal hazards for more than
50 years. Members of IGUS are meeting twice a year in the fo-
rum to prepare work performed in the matter at United Nations
level.

2.3. Reactivity and classification of typical reactive chemicals

The underpinning phenomenology of reactivity of many chemi-
cals is the basis of their official classification as recognized dangers,
and yet the reactivity of chemicals can be simultaneously in forms
of self-heating, incompatibility, pyrophoricity, and water reactivity
and so on. Concerning the topic of this article, several typical reac-
tive chemicals of interest are focused as follows to further discuss
the intricate interfaces between thermal reactivity and their classi-
fication.

AN is a thermally reactive chemical with both commercial and
military applications. The thermal hazards of AN have been widely
investigated.  AN  is  not  combustible  at  normal  temperature  and
pressure, and thus is normally regarded as an oxidizer according to

the strong oxidability. However, the reactivity of AN is very com-
plex. According to Marlair and Kordek [33] , there was a threefold-
hazard of AN, the fire related hazards, hazards related to thermal
decomposition and explosion hazards. Although many significant
fire  and  explosion  accidents,  such  as  the  Tianjin  Port  accidents
mentioned in Section 1 , have occurred during the industrial use
of  AN,  pure  AN  was  not  the  trigger  of  these  accidents.  In  most
of the accidents, fire occurred with some initiating sources, such
as the involvement of contaminations (chemical incompatibility).
Then AN played the role as a powerful supporter of fire through
the in situ oxidizing agent. Regarding the thermal stability, numer-
ous milligram scale experiments have indicated that the decompo-
sition of AN occurred when heated above some 190 °C, and the
thermal stability could be greatly reduced by the involvement of
diverse  additives,  to  name  but  a  few,  sodium  sulfate  and  potas-
sium chloride [34] , pyrite [35] , sodium and chloride salts [36 , 37] ,
inorganic acids impurities such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric
acid [38] , and many other common catalysts [39–43] . These addi-
tives are very likely to exist during manufacturing, transport, stor-
age and processing of AN and thus can cause unexpected exother-
mic reactions. As for the explosion hazards, AN itself was not a so-
called “sensitive” explosive material, but environment parameters
including confinement and contamination of the products played
role in the “accidental explosive” or explosivity potential reactiv-
ity of AN. Still today, there are many debates about the complex
sets of reactions that prevail in accidental explosions of AN [44 , 45] .
Probably, the description from the NFPA 400 can comprehensively
summarize the explosive hazards of AN, as “materials that in them-
selves are capable of detonation or explosive decomposition, but that
require a strong initiating source or that must be heated under con-
finement before initiation ” [24] .

With these complexities in reactivity, a simple allocation of AN
into oxidizing substance would certainly bring errors. In the UN
TDG’s Model Regulations [14] , several AN related substances were
specially focused regarding the hazard class, as listed in Table 3 .
The hazard class of AN depends significantly on its physical status.
Because the physical states of AN could change from one to an-
other under certain conditions, the corresponding criteria should
also  be  adjusted  according  to  the  UN  Manual  of  Tests  and  Crite-
ria  [15]  for  an  approximate  classification.  Briefly,  apart  from  UN
2071 pertaining to fertilizers presenting self-sustained decomposi-
tion hazard and accordingly classified in class 9, all other AN based
fertilizers are potentially classified into division 5.1 under UN 2067
according to expert judgment (and not testing) that has ended up
in a recent change appearing in the last version of the GHS with a
new decision logic scheme [16] . For the explosive hazards of AN, it
may be classified into division 1.1D (UN 0082) or 1.5D (UN 0331)
according to standard experiments.

The thermal hazards of organic peroxides (OPs) are also a ma-
jor concern in chemical industry. OPs as a big chemical family is
widely used as free radical sources to initiate polymerization re-
actions [46, 47] . Based on structure differences, major types of OPs
include hydroperoxides, dialkyl peroxides, diacyl peroxides, ketone
peroxide, peroxyketals, peroxyesters, peroxydicarbonates, alkylper-
oxy  carbonates  and  so  on.  For  all  OPs,  the  weak  oxygen-oxygen
linkage characterizes their thermal reactivity and spontaneous de-
composition tendency. By splitting the peroxide bonds, OPs can de-
compose  and  burn  vigorously,  releasing  a  large  amount  of  heat,
toxic and/or flammable gases or vapors [48–51] . Some kinds of OPs
decompose  explosively  in  confined  environment.  Moreover,  ther-
mal  decomposition  of  OPs  can  be  easily  initiated  and  promoted
with inclusion of impurities. Studies [9, 52, 53] have indicated that
the possible contaminants such as acids, alkalis, hydroxyl ions, and
heavy metals can act as catalysts and promoters to significantly re-
duce the thermal stability of some OPs, such ascumene hydroper-
oxide (CHP), benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and dicumyl peroxide (DCPO).
For example, under isothermal conditions, the time-to-maximum
rate ( TMR ) of 75 wt.% BPO at 80 °C was significantly reduced from
46.18 hours to less than 6 hours due to the involvement of ben-
zene, benzoic acid and phenol [50] . For more information, the fea-
tured  article  by  Clark  [46]  and  Duh  et  al.  [47]  comprehensively
summarized the thermal characteristics of peroxides and peroxide-
forming compounds.

The organic peroxides were classified into a single class by both
UN TDG (Division 5.2) and UN GHS (No.15 in category of physi-
cal hazards), and yet there are distinctions in the physicochemical
properties among different chemical members in the big OP fam-
ily. More detailed classification of OPs are necessary and have been
conducted by UN and NFPA. Both regulations considered the po-
tential fire and explosion risks as criteria for classification, as listed
in Table 4 . UN GHS [16] divided OPs into seven hazard categories
(Type A~Type G). The newest edition of NFPA 400 [24] used a five-
level classification. Such classification provided reference to differ
one OP from another, and yet they were not quite often mentioned
in existing research articles when studying the thermal decompo-
sition and assessing the thermal hazards of OPs. This is probably
because the boundaries between different types depend largely on
the experimental procedures, sample status and ambient. Besides,
both classifications did not relate to the aforementioned major OP
types, that is to say, the current classification of chemicals are di-
vorced from the structure differences of OPs, despite the fact that
both reactivity and physical hazards as basis for classification are
strongly determined by their structure information.

The chemical family of energetic materials also has complex re-
activity. Energetic materials generally refer to the substances with
energy content larger than 800 J/g [54] . Typical energetic materi-

(Corresponding to Type E by UN).
Class IV: burn in the same manner as ordinary combustibles

or they do not support combustion and present no reactivity

als include explosives, propellants, pyrotechnic compositions, and
fuels and so on. In addition to their inherent thermal instability,
explosivity  potential,  and  self-reactivity,  many  catalysts  and  pro-
moters can also accelerate the self-heating and thermal decompo-
sition of energetic materials due to chemical incompatibility. Tak-
ing the organic nitro compounds (e.g. aromatic and aliphatic ni-
tro compounds) as an example, due to the high amount of chem-
ical  energy  stored  in  the  nitro  bonds,  these  substances  can  de-
compose violently or explosively with release of a large amount
of gases in confined environment [55] . When mixed with incom-
patible  chemicals  or  contaminated  by  impurities,  thermal  run-
away will occur at a much lower temperature. Possible incompat-
ible  substances  include  sulphuric  acid,  caustic  soda,  sodium  sul-
phate/nitrate,  metallic  nitrates/chlorides,  nitrophenols,  nitrophen-
ates,  and  metal  salts/chlorides/ions  and  so  on  [56, 57] .  Some  en-
ergetic  materials,  such  as  propellants,  also  have  water-reactivity
[58, 59] .  For  example,  according  to  the  C80  experiments  by  Guo
et al. [59] , the onset decomposition temperature reduced by 10 K
if  moisture  content  of  the  studied  propellants  increased  by  30
%.  Generally,  the  reactivity  in  forms  of  flammability,  explosivity
potential, oxidability, pyrophoricity, self-heating properties, water-
reactivity, and self-reactivity are all covered by the energetic ma-
terial family, so the energetic materials may be allocated to varied
classes according to a particular reactivity form. For example, ac-
cording to UN TDG [14] , energetic materials may be classified as
Class 1, Class 4, and Division 5.1 according to the physical hazards.
Currently there is no unified scheme for accurate classification of
the big energetic material family.

Various coals [60–65] and biomass fuels of organic nature, such
as  wood,  agricultural  products  and  wastes  [66–76]  can  undergo
self-heating and spontaneous combustion if the rate of heat gen-
erated by oxidation exceeded the rate of heat dissipation. These
substances are often stored with large amounts under settled en-
vironment for long periods of time. Their self-heating stability can
be influenced by ambient temperature, ventilation, humidity, and

bulk size and so on. A typical hazardous scenario is that the uncon-
trolled spontaneous combustion of bulk biomass fuels in wildland
will cause catastrophic wildfires. This has been a highly concerned
topic  by  the  fire  community  for  many  years  [77–80] .  However,
many  biomass  fuels  are  not  highlighted  in  the  existing  UN  reg-
ulation systems, or recognized as dangerous as “self-heating sub-
stances” simply because biomass material is not often recognized
as  chemical  per  se.  Although  the  global  bioenergy  production  is
on the rise, there is no global classification system with regard to
their thermal hazards, which is quite necessary to safely manage
the biological source materials.

3. Fundamental steps towards the comprehensive assessment
of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals

Continuous efforts have been taken by researchers in relevant
fields towards the comprehensive understanding of thermal threats
of reactive chemicals. Despite the unlimited number of chemicals,
the varied thermophysical properties, and their complicated reac-
tivity, the hazard assessment could be summarized as a hierarchi-
cal process involving identification, estimation and hierarchization
[81] . Learning from hundreds pieces of existing studies in this field,
three fundamental steps were generally involved towards the com-
prehensive assessment of reactive chemicals’ thermal hazards. The
first step was to characterize the thermal decomposition mecha-
nisms. Findings in this step would contribute to the followed-by
calculation of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. The final step,
based  on  the  calculations  in  the  second  step,  was  to  character-
ize the thermal properties by appropriate thermal safety param-
eters, thermal risk diagrams and thermal risk indexes. A schematic
overview  of  the  three  fundamental  steps  is  presented  in  Fig.  3 .
Note that this summarized three-step strategy, being highlighted
by most researchers in the field for many years, can also be ap-
plied as a framework to deal with potential thermal threats of new
chemicals in future.

3.1. Step 1: identification of reaction mechanism

The term of “reaction mechanism” refers to the step by step se-
quence of elementary reactions by which overall chemical change
occurs  [82] .  From  the  reaction  kinetics  perspective,  the  reaction
mechanism of reactive materials can be simply defined by a qual-
itative distinction between autocatalysis type (AC type) and ther-
mal decomposition type (TD type, normally n -th order reactions)
[83 , 84] , or be described by a detailed mechanism scheme consist-
ing  of  several  reaction  pathways.  Fig.  4  (a)  explains  the  general
thermal  decomposition  pathways  of  AC  type  and  TD  type  reac-
tive chemicals. Currently, no standard is available to distinguish TD
type from AC type regarding a new chemical. The knowledge of
chemicals with similar structures is a rough way. For example, the
explosives, energetic materials and organic peroxides are generally
AC type substances [85 , 86] . In laboratory, the identification of AC
type compound was often performed by conducting calorimetric
experiments  and  analyzing  the  heat  release  or  sample  tempera-
ture [50 , 51 , 87 , 88] . Two laboratory approaches to identify AC and
TD type chemicals are presented by Fig. 4 (b) and (c), respectively.
As shown in Fig. 4 (b), a fundamental approach to differ AC type
chemicals from TD type is to conduct isothermal thermal decom-
position experiments. Since all physical and chemical processes are
accompanied with heat exchange, the heat production of a reaction
is proportional to the reaction rate. A TD type reaction is basically
accelerated by temperature increase and the reaction rate depends
only upon temperature through an n -th order rate law, that is, at a
certain temperature the heat flow leaps to the maximum at the
beginning  and  then  declines  exponentially  [89] .  If,  at  the  initial
stage, some intermediate free radicals are generated and in turn

trigger self-acceleration decomposition, the reaction scheme repre-
sents the mechanism of AC type. The generation and consumption
of free radicals simultaneously occur in the initial decomposition
stage (i.e. induction period), leading to the gradual increase of both
reaction rate and heat flow until they reach the climax. Then the
consumption of the intermediate product dominants the process,
and both reaction rate and heat flow start to decrease. The reaction
characteristics vary with temperature, and thus the thermal power
profiles obtained under dynamic heating program are incapable to
tell between TD type and AC type chemicals.

An  alternative  method  to  characterize  the  type  of  decompo-
sition,  as  presented  in  Fig.  4  (c),  is  to  conduct  self-heating  ex-
periments for chemicals charged in open-cup cell or confined in
the closed cell [86] . When being warmed up to the surrounding
temperature,  the  heat  generation  rate  of  the  TD  type  chemicals
can exceed the heat transfer rate from the chemical to the am-
bient throughout self-heating, and thus the temperature of chemi-
cal continuously increases until the ultimate thermal runaway oc-
curs. Differently, the AC type chemical does not continue to self-
heat when being warmed up to the surrounding temperature, but
remains  at  the  surrounding  temperature  for  a  long  time.  In  the
meantime, the autocatalyst is generated and proceeds very slowly.
The final thermal runaway happens when all the autocatalysts are
produced. Note that in the induction period, there is no noticeable
thermal conversion at temperature lower than the onset temper-
ature. Finally the heat generation rate suddenly increases to the
maximum, with a higher order of magnitudes than heat genera-
tion rate of the induction period [90 , 91] .

In  addition  to  the  laboratory  thermogram  methods,  Bou-Diab
[90] discussed the potential capability of apparent activation en-
ergy  ( E a )  to  identify  the  autocatalytic  decomposition.  The  au-
thor calculated the apparent activation energy of a large amount
of  chemicals  through  dynamic  Differential  Scanning  Calorimeter
(DSC) experiments, and derived a threshold to differ TD type sub-
stances from AC type. If the value of activation energy was higher
than 220 kJ mol −1 , the decomposition was assumed to be autocat-
alytic. This method was validated against 100 commonly used pure
compounds in chemical industry, with reliability of 80 % when the
value of E a ranged from 180 to 220 kJ mol −1 . This study provided
implication for the quantitative identification of autocatalytic reac-
tions, and yet estimation methods with higher reliability should be
developed and validated against a larger dataset of chemical from
different hazard classes.

Although the three methods above enable the identification of
possible autocatalytic reactivity of AC type chemicals, these meth-
ods are unable to tell exactly what chemical reactions happen dur-
ing thermal decomposition. The main chemical compounds, partic-
ularly the free radicals that significantly contribute to autocataly-
sis and thermal runaway hazards, can only be identified by chem-
ical  component  based  reaction  pathways  [92] .  Detailed  reaction
steps of a chemical reaction are normally unable to obtain, so the
conjectured mechanism has been alternatively applied to identify
the major reactions during decomposition. An example of conjec-
tured mechanism developed by Muravyev et al. [93] is presented
by the illustration in Fig. 5 , where the thermal decomposition pro-
cess  of  dihydroxylammonium  5,50-bistetrazole-1,10-diolate  (TKX-

50) was described with two steps within temperature regions of
443~463  K  and  488  ~523  K,  respectively.  Both  the  thermal  dia-
gram profiles and the calculated reaction kinetics indicated a two-
step mechanism, which was presented chemically by detecting the
intermediates and products through an Infrared Spectroscopy (IR)
spectroscopy and an X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique (marked in
blue), respectively.

Plenty studies have been performed regarding the development
of conjectured reaction mechanism for reactive chemicals. The ap-
proaches  can  be  theoretical  ones  with  computational  chemistry
or experimental ones through chemical analysis techniques, which
will  be  featured  in  Sections  4.1.1  and 4.2.1 ,  respectively.  On  one
hand, information provided by a conjectured thermolysis mecha-
nism of initial stages indicates the inherent reactivity of chemicals,
whereby the source of thermal hazards can be controlled by recon-
struction of chemical structure in the R&D level. Besides, a visual
thermal decomposition scheme consisting of several controlled re-
actions is required to develop material’s pyrolysis models, which
is becoming more and more popular among researchers to study
material’s fire behavior under different scenarios [94–98] . A com-
prehensive understanding of reaction mechanism is also a funda-
mental  step  towards  the  followed-by  calculation  of  kinetics  and
thermodynamics, as well as the characterization of thermal safety
properties.

3.2. Step 2: calculation of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics

Both  kinetic  properties  (how  fast  a  reaction  takes  place)  and
thermodynamics (how much energy is released) are fundamental
data to characterize the thermal stability, flammability and fire be-
havior of reactive chemicals. The definition of safety operating lim-
its for a chemical process also requires the information provided
by  kinetics  and  thermodynamics  [99] .  Reaction  kinetics  is  a  nu-
merical description of reactions progress (rate) as function of time
t or temperature T . The fundamental purpose of reaction kinetics
analysis is to obtain the kinetic triplet, i.e. the reaction model (or
mechanism function) f ( α), the apparent activation energy E a , and
the pre-exponential factor A . Numerous methodologies have been
proposed to determine reaction kinetics on basis of thermal de-
composition experiments. This paper will present some typical ap-
proaches in this field, and introduce the recent updates in kinetics
calculation through inverse analysis.

As a basic indicator for chemical’s inherent reactivity, kinetics
should be determined when the sample is thermally thin. Thermo-
gravimetry (TG) and DSC are among the most frequently used mil-
ligram scale techniques to determine kinetics and thermodynam-
ics. In TG analysis, the mass data collected as a function of tem-
perature is transformed to a non-dimensional parameter, the con-
version rate or reaction extent α. The value of α varies between 0
and 1, as defined in Eq. (1) . Subscript 0 and f denote the initial and
final mass, respectively. m refers to the instantaneous mass during
decomposition.
α = ( m 0 − m ) / ( m 0 − m

f )

The  majority  of  kinetic  methods  used  in  the  area  of  thermal
analysis consider the rate to be a function of only two variables,
T  and α.  The  dependence of  the  process  rate  on  temperature  is
represented by the rate constant, k ( T ), which is normally assumed
to follow the Arrhenius Law with Eq. (2) for a single-step process.
Numerous reaction models denoted by f ( α) were summarized in
these publications [100–103] .

The reaction rate expression varies with the number of reaction
stages and assumption of reaction models, but can all be solved

by  both  model-fitting  and  model-free  (iso-conversional)  analysis.
Typical model-free methods mainly include the Kissinger method,
the Friedman method and the Flynn/Wall/Ozawa (FWO) method.
Li et al. [104] calculated the kinetic triplets by using five differ-
ent  model-free  methods,  model  fitting  method,  and  distributed
activation  energy  model  (DAEM)  method.  Except  from  Friedman
method, the curves of the apparent activation energy values versus
conversional extent obtained from the other four iso-conversional
methods coincide with each other. More methodologies have been
summarized in the guidelines of performing kinetic computations
on thermal analysis recommended by the Kinetics Committee of
the International Confederation for Thermal Analysis and Calorime-
ter (ICTAC) [101, 102] . Among numerous model-free kinetic analy-
sis methods, an “overall DSC plus TG processed with Kissinger or
FWO  method” has  been  widely  applied  to  obtain  kinetics  of  re-
active chemicals. The analysis process is as follows. Experiments
in dynamic temperature rise or isothermal model should be con-
ducted primarily to obtain the thermal power or mass loss pro-
file. Then the profile can be analyzed to calculate reaction kinet-
ics according to the procedures included by the American Society
for Testing Material (ASTM), with the latest standard of E2890-12
(2018) [105] (Kissinger method) and E698-18 [106] (FWO method),
respectively.

Thermodynamic parameters mainly refer to the entropy of acti-
vation ( (cid:3)S (cid:3) = / (cid:3)S ∗), the enthalpy of activation ( (cid:3)H (cid:3) = / (cid:3)H ∗), and the
free  energy  of  activation  ( (cid:3)G (cid:3) = / (cid:3)G ∗).  According  to  the  activated
complex  theory  (or  the  transition  theory)  [107] ,  the  calculation
equations for thermodynamics are based on Eqs. (3) –(5) ,

where e is the Neper number (2.7183); χ is the transition factor
which is unity for monomolecular reactions; R is the gas constant
B  is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10 −23 J/K);
(8.314 J/mol/K); k
h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10 −34  J s), and T
P  is the peak
temperature of Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) or DSC curves
at the corresponding exothermic decomposition stage.

A positive value of (cid:3)S ∗ indicates the malleable activated com-
plex which leads to large degrees of freedom of rotation and vibra-
tion [109 , 110] , or the corresponding activated complex is of lower
degree of arrangement than the initial state [110] . In other words,
the corresponding stage with a positive (cid:3)S ∗ can be regarded as a
“fast” stage. A negative value of (cid:3)S ∗ means a “slow” stage. A posi-
tive value of (cid:3)G ∗ indicates that the stage is not a spontaneous pro-
cess at room temperature and is necessary to connect with intro-
duction of heat. A larger value of (cid:3)G ∗ refers to a harder decompo-
sition process. A positive value of (cid:3)H ∗ is related to the endother-
mic  peaks  in  DTA/DSC  curve.  And  a  large  value  of  (cid:3)H ∗ means
that  the  corresponding  decomposition  process  needs  more  ener-
gies than the lower one. Detailed discussions of thermodynamics
are available in these literatures [107–112] .

In  recent  years,  inverse  modeling  (or  inverse  analysis)  is  in-
creasingly regarded as a promising methodology to obtain reliable
kinetics and thermodynamics. The fundamental principle of inverse
modeling is to obtain kinetic parameters that can validate against
the experimental data, mainly by TG. Inverse analysis generally in-
volves three steps that may be repeated as many times as neces-
sary. The first step is to determine an appropriate functional form
to model the parameter of interest, such as the kinetics triplet. The
second step is to simulate the experiments based on the model de-
veloped with an initial guess of desired parameters. And the last
step  is  to  iteratively  adjust  the  parameters  in  the  model  till  an

acceptable agreement between the experimental data and model
prediction is achieved.

Several  generalized  pyrolysis  modeling  methodologies  have
been developed and successfully applied to determine the kinetics
and thermodynamics of varied chemicals and substances. One typ-
ical framework among them is the ThermaKin developed by Sto-
liarov and Lyon [113, 114] . By inverse analysis of TG, DSC and Mi-
croscale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC) data, ThermaKin enables
the determination of kinetics, thermodynamics and heats of com-
plete  combustion  of  gaseous  pyrolyzate  released  during  decom-
position. This methodology has good flexibility to define most of
the  thermophysical  parameters  of  a  component  as  functions  of
temperature  through  quadratic  polynomial  formulations.  Another
prominent pyrolysis modeling methodology, the open-source tool
of Gpyro, also provides the manually-iterated inverse modeling en-
vironment  to  determine  the  kinetics  and  thermodynamics  [94] .
Gpyro was originally developed to simulate a wide range of sce-
narios  including  sample  temperature,  species,  and  pressure  dis-
tributions inside the combustible solids during pyrolysis. Kinetics
of both heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions can
be captured in Gpyro through inverse analysis of relevant experi-
ments.

For  some  AC  type  highly  reactive  chemicals  containing  nu-
merous  fast  parallel  reactions  during  decomposition,  the  inverse
modeling  as  a  sophisticated  calculation  method  has  been  con-
ducted  to  find  the  best  sets  of  kinetics  to  validate  against  both
DSC  and  TG  data.  For  example,  Wei  et  al.  [115]  conducted  both
n -th  order  and  autocatalytic  modeling  with  nonlinear  optimiza-
tion  methods  to  calculate  the  kinetics  of  NC.  Only  kinetics  ob-
tained  by  autocatalytic  model  were  successfully  verified  by  the
experimental  heat  production  and  heat  production  rate.  A  se-
ries of similar studies was also performed by Lin and co-authors
to  obtain  reliable  reaction  kinetics  of  a  series  of  high  exother-
mic AC type materials, including tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB)
[116] ,  octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine  (HMX)  [117] ,
2,4,6,8,10,12-Hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaaza-isowurtzitane  (HNIW)
[118] , and rifle gun propellant (GP) [119] and so on.

To obtain the best fit for experimental data, optimization is a
fundamental mathematical action during inverse analysis. So far,
the most popular optimization algorithm to extract kinetics (and
thermodynamics) is the natural selection based evolutional algo-
rithm of genetic algorithm (GA) [120] . As a robust heuristic search
method,  GA  is  widely  used  for  data  search  and  optimization  to
obtain  the  most  fitted  dataset.  Some  examples  are  given  as  fol-
lows. Ben Talouba et al. [51] combined GA with a locally conver-
gent method to estimate and optimize the reaction kinetics of ther-
mal decomposition of organic peroxides. Rein and co-authors have
successfully applied GA to optimize the inverse modeling results
with  several  cases,  including  the  kinetic  and  stoichiometric  pa-
rameters of scheme in smoldering combustion polyurethane foam
[121] , the thermal and oxidative decomposition kinetics of shoul-
dering combustion of peat in wildland [122] , and the pyrolysis ki-
netics and multi-objective inverse modeling related properties of
cellulose [123] and so on. Li et al. [124] determined the pyrolysis
kinetics properties of medium density fiberboard by inversely an-
alyzing TG and DSC data and optimizing the results with GA. In
Ding et al.’s work [125] , another optimization algorithm, Shuffled
Complex Evolution was applied to optimize the pyrolysis kinetic
properties of beech. The derived kinetics was able to predict the
TG data at heating rates from 5 to 80 K/min. It is worth mention-
ing that, the advanced properties in optimization algorithms con-
tribute to another feature of inverse analysis, i.e. the capability to
develop multi-step reaction mechanisms and then to calculate the
kinetics and thermodynamics of each step involved. This feature
is particularly useful when dealing with decompositions consisting
of second-order reactions. The aforementioned framework of Ther-

maKin possesses such feature to determine the kinetics and ther-
modynamics of up to 30 reactions within a single pyrolysis model.
On basis of the data of each step, both mass loss and heat release
of each component involved in the defined mechanism can be sep-
arated from the total TG and DSC profiles, respectively, to indicate
the effects of particular reactions and components on the entire
thermal decomposition process.

3.3. Step 3: characterization of thermal safety properties

3.3.1. Determination of thermal safety parameters

A large number of thermal safety parameters have been used in
literatures to characterize the thermal hazards of reactive chemi-
cals. This review will summarize some commonly used ones by re-
ferring to relevant literatures/standards, as listed in Table 5 . These
standards are mainly retrieved from the latest ASTM regulations,
with several ones from the UN regulations. Note that many of the
ASTM standards cited in Table 5 are provided by the ASTM Com-
mittee E27 (Hazard Potential of Chemicals). As one of the most ac-
tive committees focusing on hazards of chemicals for more than 30
years, the committee members have published numerous, widely
used consensus standards dealing with testing and predictive pro-
cedures to characterize thermal stability, chemical incompatibility,
energy  release,  flammability  and  ignitability  of  substances.  More
information about the important role of ASTM E27 in international
hazard assessment was discussed by Frurip et al. [99] and Britton
et al. [126] . All the ASTM standards mentioned in this article can
be accessed online at www.ASTM.org or in the annual print ASTM
Standard. A few parameters and procedures defined in ASTM were
also cited by the NFPA to develop their own standards, as com-
pared by these authors [99 , 126] . Table 5 also involves a column
of risk index designation, which will be explained in Section 3.3.2 .
From the current research status, hazards related to thermal stabil-
ity, pyrophoricity, self-heating properties, self-reactivity have been
highly focused as the most common causes of thermal runaway,
and thus relevant thermal safety parameters are primarily focused
in the following contents. Flammability and explosivity potential
related parameters will also be briefly introduced at the end of this
section.

The very basic parameter to describe thermal stability of reac-
tive  chemicals  is  the  onset  temperature  ( T on ,  T onset ,  or  T o ).  As  a
critical temperature term, it is listed in the UN TDG’s recommenda-
tion of Manual of Tests and Criteria [15] , referring to the minimum
temperature at which thermal decomposition occurs, and. The in-
terpretation of onset temperature is fundamental when conduct-
ing DSC, TG and similar thermal screening experiments. T on could
be  determined  as  the  cross  temperature  point  between  baseline
and tangent line of a heat flow or mass loss profile. The standard
test procedure to determine onset temperature by DSC is involved
in the ASTM E537-12 [127] entitled Thermal Stability of Chemicals
by  Differential  Scanning  Calorimeter .  Under  isothermal  conditions,
the onset temperature describes the Constant-Temperature Stabil-
ity ( CTS ), which is involved in the ASTM E487-14 standard [128] .

Although researchers have applied T on to describe the thermal
stability of chemicals for a long time [129] , its capability to accu-
rately represent the thermal hazards is questionable. Hofelich and
LaBarge [130] discussed the misuse of T on  and pointed out that,
T on was not an upper stability limit for the start of reaction, or a
critical temperature for safety operation. Some researchers derived
f ), peak temperature ( T p , T m , or T max ), and
the final temperature ( T
highest heat flow or peak power ( W p ) [46, 52 , 131] from thermo-
grams, and listed together with T on to describe the thermal prop-
erty of chemicals. For reactive chemicals releasing a large amount
of gases, parameters including the maximum pressure during over-
all  reaction  ( P max )  and  maximum  pressure  rise  rate  ((d P /d t ) max )
were also used to characterize the potential risk of explosion. In-

It is applicable for thermal decomposition under micro calorimetric
experiments. The value depends on measurement techniques.
It refers to the energy liberated when a substance undergoes
complete combustion, with excess of oxygen at standard conditions
(25 °C and 1 bar), or the enthalpy change for the combustion
reaction. It is sometimes used in combustion/fire behavior
calorimetric experiments as total heat release ( THR ).

It describes the mass consumption by TG experiments. It can be
applied for all kinds of scenario with mass loss. It is often noted as
total mass loss ( TML ) in fire experiments.
It is one of the hazard potential figures-of-merit, referring to the
observed temperature rise of a self-heating decomposition reaction
under adiabatic conditions. The PHI-factor should be considered
before calculation.
It is applicable for combustible dusts.

It is applicable for bench/large scale fire tests. It is often measured
together with Visible Smoke Release Rates and HRR through certain
standard procedures.

It describes the mass loss by TG, combustion/fire behavior tests, and
other experiments which involve mass loss. It is calculated as the
first-order derivation of mass loss.

It is applicable for both thermal decomposition behavior (through
DSC or similar techniques), and combustion/fire behavior (with fire
calorimeters). The value obtained by microscale tests refers to the
first-order derivation of heat flow. The second application is more
popular, referring to the heat available in every square foot of
surface absorbing heat within a particular surface. It is often
measured with oxygen consumption theor.

It is applicable for bench and large scale combustion/fire behavior
experiments.

It normally describes the pressure change of samples by calorimeter
experiments, or by other non-standard tests where the pressure is
measured.

formation of pressure can be obtained through a Vent Sizing Pack-
age  (VSP/VSP2)  [9 , 52 , 132–135] ,  or  by  a  pressure-sensitive  trans-
ducer with C80 calorimeter [38 , 52 , 136 , 137] . These parameters all
provide basic information of chemical’s thermal behavior, and yet
are of limited help as a single parameter to characterize the ther-
mal  stability,  since  they  are  largely  influenced  by  the  sensitiv-
ity  of  calorimeter,  sample  size,  sample  status,  and  heating  rate
and so on.

When  describing  the  critical  time  of  thermal  decomposition,
the  Time-to-Maximum-Rate  ( TMR ),  as  one  of  the  hazard  poten-
tial figures-of-merits of ASTM E1231-19 standard [138] , is a rec-
ommended  parameter.  TMR  describes  the  possibility  for  chemi-
cals to undergo thermal runaway, or the time available for emer-
gency  response  [139] .  The  TMR  can  be  experimentally  measured
by  calorimeters,  or  be  analytically  calculated  on  basis  of  kinet-
ics,  heat  capacity,  and  heat  of  decomposition.  The  experimental

method is to analyze the time required by an exothermic reaction
to reach the maximum temperature rise. Since TMR is usually de-
termined under isothermal adiabatic condition, more detailed de-
scription could be, time to maximum rate under adiabatic condi-
ad ), or adiabatic time to maximum rate as a function of
tions ( TMR
initial temperature ( TMR ( T
iso ). A relevant term of Reaction
Induction Time ( RIT ) is involved in the ASTM E2026-16 standard
[140] , referring to the time of the induction period under isother-
mal condition (normally from room temperature to 400 °C) for ma-
terials with catalytic, autocatalytic, and accelerating reactions.

in ), TMR

The experimental TMR can be affected by both vessel type and
sample mass. For example, comparing to stainless-steel DSC, an Ac-
celerating Rate Calorimeter (ARC) or a glass vessel based C80 with
sample amount larger than 2 g was more reliable to measure TMR
[139] . Note that when applying ARC, the thermal inertia of PHI fac-
tor ( (cid:5)) should be considered since part of the reaction heat is used
to  heat  up  the  sample  bomb  [141] .  The  analytical  calculation  of
ad  is based on the heat exchange and energy balance theory.

where c p is the specific heat, U is the overall heat transfer coeffi-

becomes zero, and there is a thermal equilibrium between sample
and cell. Based on the relations of system temperature, heat re-

Therefore, it is able to analytically estimate the TMR

also be calculated by some well-developed commercial software,
such as the Advanced Kinetics and Technology Solution software

hazards of vessels containing reactive chemicals, the assumptions
must be carefully considered.

For non-adiabatic system, the safety parameter SADT or T
SADT
was proposed. SADT is an internationally recognized criterion rec-
ommended  by  the  UN  TDG  [14 , 15]  to  evaluate  thermal  hazards
of chemicals stored in packages as dangerous goods. The UN GHS
[16] also inherited SADT as a classification criterion for self-reactive
substances.  According  to  UN  TDG  [14] ,  the  definition  of  SADT
is, “the lowest temperature at which self-accelerating decomposition
may occur with a substance in the packaging as used in transport ”.
The modified term of self-heating oxidation temperatures ( SHOT s)
was used  by Wang and co-authors  [144 , 145] when studying  the
spontaneous oxidation of cotton and coal stockpile. SADT depends
strongly  on  the  ambient  temperature,  decomposition  kinetics  of
substance,  packaging  shape,  and  the  heat  transfer  properties  of

determination methods as follows [15] ,

• H.1: United States SADT test, package transport;
• H.2: Adiabatic storage test (AST), packages, IBCs and tanks;
• H.3: Isothermal storage test (IST), packages, IBCs and tanks pack-

ages, IBCs and tanks;

• H.4: Heat accumulation storage test (Dewar test), packages, IBCs

and small tanks;

Only H.1 test can directly determine SADT of real packages with
size up to 220 L. The other three methods are laboratory-scale tests
and scale-up procedures are required to determine the SADTs for
real packaging. Although H.1 test gives the most reliable answer,
it  was  rarely  used  due  to  the  expensiveness.  The  H.2~H.4  tests
are attractive but all have limitations [146–148] . Numerous pub-
lications  are  available  dealing  with  both  laboratory  experiments
of SADT and its scale-up methodologies. The update Orange Book
(St/SG/AC.10/11Rev6.) [15] noted that the H series SADT tests are
not exhaustive and other tests may be used if they give correct
SADT of the substance packaged for transport.

Currently, the combination of milligram scale calorimeter and
theoretical models is primarily used to estimate SADTs [149–153] .
Different  equations  for  SADT  estimation  have  been  proposed  ac-
cording to solid system, liquid system, system with large surface-
area to volume ratio, and well-stirred liquid system with low vis-
cosity [154–156] . Comparing to large scale tests, experiments by
milligram scale calorimeters are safer and of less costs, but should
be  carefully  conducted  to  ensure  reliable  scale-up  of  data.  The
working conditions of different calorimeters may lead to errors in
SADT measurement. For example, the estimated SADTs through ARC
were less reliable than C80 due to low sensitivity [178] . Whether
the  SADT  of  tested  substance  is  in  the  validation  domain  of  se-
lected  equipment  should  be  checked  before  experiments.  In  ad-
dition,  physical  behaviors  such  as  melting  and  sublimation  may
occur at temperature close to the decomposition onset tempera-
ture  and  thus  influence  the  reliability  of  SADT .  Taking  the  2,2’-
azobis (isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) as an example [153] , the exother-
mic and endothermic effects competed with each other at temper-
ature at around SADT , leading to difficulty in identifying the real
SADT. Moreover, SADT is not applicable to identify the critical con-
dition of chemicals with autocatalytic reaction, because it is always
higher than the critical thermal runaway temperature. A more de-
tailed  discussion  of  SADT  estimation  methodologies  and  possible
errors was presented by Kossoy and Sheinman [147] . Several com-
putational models or simulation tools have been proposed to de-
termine SADT through heat balance equations, which will be dis-
cussed in Section 4.1.2 .

On basis of SADT , UN defined another two temperature related
criteria, the Control Temperature ( CT ) and the Emergency Temper-
ature  ( ET )  [15] .  CT  refers  to  the  maximum  temperature  for  sub-
stances to be safely transported. ET is the temperature at which
emergency procedures should be implemented when losing tem-
perature control. The values of CT and ET are determined on basis
of the packaging conditions and the region of SADT , according to
the principles listed in Table 6 .

The term of No-Return Temperature ( TNR or T

NR ) is often used
together with SADT , referring to a critical temperature at which the
change of heat generation equals the heat loss. Similar terms, in-
cluding the critical ambient temperature ( CAT ) and thermal decom-
position temperature  ( TDT ), were  applied by  Luo  and  co-authors
to describe the self-heating property of biomass and fishmeal un-
der  certain  storage  conditions  [157–159] .  TDT  was  directly  mea-
sured through experiments, and CAT (i.e. TNR ) was calculated from
Frank-Kamenetskii theory. They defined the term of Lower Criti-
cal Ambient Temperature ( LCAT ) and Upper Critical Ambient Tem-
perature ( UCAT ) to describe the critical steady state. The relation-
ship between TNR and SADT can be understood by the thermogram
of  heat  generation  and  heat  release,  which  will  be  described  in
Section 4.1.2 .

These parameters mentioned above are the critical values that
characterize the possibility of thermal runaway incidents. To de-
scribe how much energy is released, the term of heat of reaction
or heat of decomposition (of per unit mass sample) is normally
used to describe the heat release, represented as (cid:3)H , (cid:3)H r , (cid:3)H
d ,
or Q . Based on the Hess’s Law, the heat of reaction depends only
on the initial and final state, not the reaction path, so the (cid:3)H can
be calculated as the integration of heat release rate (d H /d t ) in all
the temperature range or in all the time range (if the heating rate
is equal). Technically, (cid:3)H calculated by calorimetric experiments
includes the thermodynamic heat of reaction, the heat absorbed
by  sample  cell,  and  other  effects  such  as  evaporation  [160 , 161] ,
therefore the reduction of baseline is important to avoid potential
errors. Some researchers applied the similar term of total energy
release or energy content ( TER, TER ( T
in )) [116] to measure the po-
tential severity of an accident. For single stage reaction under adia-
batic conditions, the TER can be evaluated from the adiabatic tem-
in ) depends on the
perature rise. For multi-stage reactions, TER ( T

The term of auto ignition temperature ( AIT ) is commonly used
to characterize the degree of auto-ignitability of chemicals. AIT is
the lowest temperature at which substance spontaneously ignites
in  normal  atmosphere  without  an  external  ignition  source.  This
temperature is required to supply the activation energy required
for  combustion.  Being  included  in  the  ASTM  E659-15  [162] ,  AIT
has been applied as a general term for various auto ignition sce-
narios. Many similar terms have been used, such as the sponta-
neous  ignition  temperature  ( SIT,  T
SI ),  the  critical  self-
CR ), the thermal ignition
ignition temperature ( T
TlAD  or
temperature ( T
be0  or T
t
cr,hot-spot )
ig ) and the critical temperature of hot-spot initiation ( T
[70 , 163–167] . They all represent the lowest tempearture at which
reactive substance has the potential to transform from thermal de-
composition to explosion. In addition to the inherent chemical and
physical properties of subtances, the critical ignition parameter can
be  influenced  by  the  experiments,  sample  conditions  (e.g.  parti-
cle size) and the environment (e.g. whether confined). For exam-
ple, the SADTs of TD type chemicals are often lower than TCR , and
yet  the SADT can be much  higher than TCR for  autocatalytic  re-
action [147] . AIT can also be analytically calculated, as detailed in
Section 4.1 .

Explosion  potential  is  one  of  the  hazard  potential  figures-of-
merits included in the ASTM E1231-19 standard [138] to describe
the  explosive  safety  of  reactive  chemicals.  It  is  also  required  by
the REACH Regulation to describe both impact sensitivity and ther-
mal stability of chemicals. Explosivity is a complicated reactivity
phenomenon and depends largely on the physical status of chem-
icals (e.g. solid, liquid, gas, dust layer and dust cloud) and ambi-
ent. Many characterization parameters have been applied by dif-
ferent  authors,  to  name  but  a  few,  the  maximum  rate  of  pres-
sure  rise  (d p /d t )  [10] ,  limiting  oxygen  concentration  ( LOC )  [73] ,
specific constant ( K max ) [74] , detonation velocity, pressure or tem-

perature, heat of detonation [74] , minimum ignition energy ( MIE )
[168] , maximum explosion pressure ( P max ) [168] , thermal sensitiv-
ity probability density function ( S ( T )) [169] and thermal explosion
probability ( P
TE ) [170] and so on. A few parameters are included
in the ASTM with standard testing procedures, such as the critical
half  thickness  in  E1231-19  [138] ,  the  maximum  rate  of  pressure
rise ( KSt ) and maximum pressure ( P max ) for combustible dusts in
E1226-12a [171] , and the minimum explosible concentration ( MEC )
of combustible dusts in E1515-14 [172] . The term of critical temper-
atures of thermal explosion ( T
b ) was often applied to de-
scribe the explosive potential of energetic materials with milligram
scale  experiments  [115 , 163 , 173 , 174] .  A  simple  estimation  method
on basis of Semenov’s thermal explosion theory was applied to es-
timate this critical parameter, as presented in Eqs. (10) and (11) ,
where a, b, c and d are coefficients and can be obtained by sev-
eral groups of T on under different heating rates ( β). When β ap-
proaches  0,  the  value  of  T on  equals  to  a .  To  apply  this  method,
calorimetric experiments under at least three heating rates should
be performed.

To describe the flammability of a liquid, the standard term of
Flash  Point  ( FP )  is  included  in  the  ASTM  E502-07  [175]  and  re-
quired by both REACH and UN for packaging and labeling of haz-
ardous liquids. The definition of FP is, “the lowest temperature of the
liquid (as measured in a prescribed manner) at a pressure corrected
to 101.325 kPa, at which application of an ignition source causes the
vapor of the liquid to ignite momentarily and the flame to propagate
across the surface of the liquid under the specified conditions of test ”
[176] .  The  relevant  terms  of  Lower  and  Upper  Flammable  Limit
Temperatures  ( LFLT  and  UFLT )  are  included  in  the  ASTM  E1232-
07 (2019) [177] to describe the flammability of liquid in equilib-
rium with vapor in air. The flammability of gases is characterized
in  the  REACH  Regulation  by  the  Lower  and  Upper  Flammability
Limits ( LFL and UFL ) with air at 293.15 K and standard pressure of
101.3 kPa, and included in E681-09 (2015) [178] as the lower and
upper flammable concentration limit ( LCL and UCL ). Similar terms
include the Lower Explosive Limit ( LEL ), the upper flash point or
upper explosion point, the Limiting Oxygen (Oxidant) Concentra-
tion ( LOC ) for gases and vapors in E2079-19 [179] and E2931-13
(2019)  [180] ,  and  the  flammability  limits  for  combustible  vapor-
oxidant mixtures in E918-83 (2011) [181] and so on.

Some  thermal  safety  parameters  were  proposed  for  certain
kinds  of  substances  or  under  certain  conditions.  For  example,  a
self-heating rate index, R
70  is defined as the ratio of time taken
to reach 70 °C/h to measure the spontaneous combustion propen-
sity  of  coals  [61 , 182] .  Thermal  safety  parameters  related  to  dust
layer or dust cloud defined by the latest ASTM standards mainly
include, the Minimum Auto Ignition Temperature for dust clouds
(E1491-06 (2019)) [183] , the Hot-Surface Ignition Temperature of
Dust Layers (E2021-15) [184] , the Minimum Ignition Energy ( MIE )
for dust cloud in air (E2019-03 (2019)) [185] and for gaseous mix-
tures (E582-07 (2013) e1) [186] . Other dust safety related terms
collected from previous studies with no standards mainly include,
the layer ignition temperature ( LIT ) (safe surface temperature of a
particular  dust),  the  maximum  permissible  surface  temperatures
( MPST )  (ignition  temperature  of  a  dust  layer  with  known  thick-
ness decreased by a safety factor of 75 °C), the minimum ignition
temperature ( MIT ) (the lowest temperature at which dust ignited),
the minimum ignition temperature with the dust forming a cloud
( MIT/MIT c ) or deposited in a layer ( MIT

l ) [187–189] .

Parameters to describe the fire behavior of materials are also
included in Table 5 . Heat Release Rate ( HRR ) is arguably the sin-
gle most important parameter to characterize the flammability of
products and their consequent fire hazards [190] . HRR in fire tests
refers to the available heat in every square foot of surface absorb-
ing heat within a particular surface, or how much a given mate-
rial contributes to the energy production and fire growth. Relevant
latest ASTM standards for calculation of HRR mainly include, the
E906M-17 [191] by thermopile method, the E1354-17 [192] , E1474-
14 [193] , E2965-17 [194] and E2067-15 [195] by oxygen consump-
tion calorimetry fire tests with different scales. The integration of
HRR with corresponding time region leads to another parameter,
Total Heat Release ( THR ), referring to the total energy production
during material’s fire behavior. A relevant term is the heat of com-
bustion ( H c ), which is included in E2965-17 [194] by oxygen con-
sumption  calorimeter,  in  D240-19  [196]  and  D4809-18  [197]  by
bomb calorimeter, and in E2067-15 [195] by full-scale oxygen con-
sumption  calorimetry.  Similarly,  the  Mass  Loss  Rate  ( MLR )  was
used to describe the mass loss in a fire incident through conical ra-
diant heater on basis of E2102-17 [198] , or by oxygen consumption
calorimetry according to E2965-17 [194] and E2067-15 [195] . The
integration of MLR with time indicates the total mass consumed
during combustion.

Another important term in the field of fire research is the Heat
Flux, referring to the rate of heat energy transferred per surface
unit area. A critical radiant flux [199] is normally used to describe
the minimum heat flux at which a material with exposure of cer-
tain radiant flux can ignited under bench scale fire behavior tests.
Similarly, the critical ignition time, or time to ignition can also be
derived  to  estimate  the  ignitibility  of  materials.  It  can  be  mea-
sured through conical radiant heater according to the procedure
of E2102-17 [198] , or via full-scale oxygen consumption calorime-
try  with  E2067-15  [195] .  Other  terms  derived  from  bench  and
large  scale  fire  behavior  tests  and  relevant  standards  mainly  in-
clude, Time to Sustained Flaming in E2965-17 [194] ; Smoke Pro-
duction in E2965-17 [194] , E2067-15 [195] and E800-14 [200] ; Vis-
ible Smoke Release Rate in E906M-17 [191] and E1354-17 [192] .
Note that these fire behavior parameters have not been widely ap-
plied for reactive chemicals, because of the limited fire behavior
experiments  conducted  by  previous  researchers.  Section  4.2  will
further discuss this issue. One thing to note, sometimes the terms
of heat release rate and mass loss rate were used to describe the
heat flow and mass consumption information of thermograms ob-
tained by milligram scale experiments.

In  summary,  various  parameters  have  been  proposed  to  de-
scribe the thermal properties of reactive chemicals. Although the
underpinning phenomena of thermal stability, ignitability and ex-
plosivity  differ  from  each  other,  when  the  analysis  is  based  on
calorimeters  at  milligram  scale,  the  experimental  methodology
(e.g. techniques, temperature program, and procedures), data out-
puts (e.g. an exothermic thermogram) as well as the fundamen-
tal data processing methods (e.g. detection of onset temperature,
heat of reaction, pressure change or kinetics) are often in the same
manner. The major difference is how to interpret the potential re-
activity  and  thermal  hazards  with  proper  subscripts.  The  devel-
opment of computer science and technology has provided conve-
nience to analytically predict most of the aforementioned parame-
ters, either by considering the relationship between inherent ther-
mal reactivity and molecular structure (for absolute parameters) or
by solving the conservation equations with heat and mass transfer
theories. Relevant approaches will be introduced in Section 4.1 .

Since no single parameter can fully characterize the reactivity
of a substance or a reactive system, a certain set of safety param-
eters was often used to represent the thermal hazards from dif-
ferent perspectives. Kossoy et al. [12] recommended four criteria
for preliminary assessment of reactive hazards, including time to

conversion limit under isothermal conditions ( TCL ) [160] , TMR , adi-
abatic temperature rise ( (cid:3)T ), and a reactivity rating number ( N r )
defined by NFPA. In a series of the so-called green thermal analy-
sis conducted by Lin and co-authors [116–119 , 201] , thermal safety
parameters such as (cid:3)H , E a , SADT , CT , ET , TCR , TMR , TER , and TCL
were all listed for both solid and liquid reactive chemicals. Among
these studies, there were rare discussions that divided the thermal
safety parameters into different categories. In a relevant study per-
formed by Cao et al. [202] , TMR
iso was used as an index to indicate
whether an autocatalytic reaction would occur promptly; (cid:3)H , and
Q max under constant temperatures were used to analyze the degree
of thermal hazards during transportation and storage; and SADT ,
TCL , CT and ET were used to indicate the likelihood of fire and ex-
plosion. In a series of studies of self-ignition risks of biomass fuels
[73 , 74 , 203 , 204] , two perspectives were focused, thermal suscepti-
bility  and  thermal  stability.  Thermal  susceptibility  was  reflected
by  three  parameters,  the  propensity  to  oxidize  (a  Maciejasz  in-
dex), the thermal degradation (the temperature of the emission of
flammable volatile substances), and self-ignition risk ( E a and char-
acteristic oxidation temperature, T
charact ). Meanwhile thermal sta-
bility was characterized by the self-ignition temperature ( SIT ) with
sample stored in an isothermal hot oven. Such categorizations help
to define the thermal properties of reactive chemicals from differ-
ent perspectives. But further discussions on how to better catego-
rize the aforementioned thermal safety parameters for hazard as-
sessment are still required.

This review presents three perspectives which may help with
this  topic.  A  very  simple  perspective  is  to  divide  them  into  ab-
solute  and  relative  parameter.  Absolute  parameters,  such  as  FP ,
are  the  inherent  physicochemicial  properties  of  chemicals.  Rela-
tive  parameters,  such  as  TMR ,  depend  on  both  inherent  proper-
ties and experimental conditions. Most of the thermal safety pa-
rameters are relative ones. Secondly, since thermal safety param-
eters in essence are either the threshold to cause the underpin-
ning phenomena of reactivity, or the consequences caused by the
phenomena, the parameters can be related into the reactivity cat-
egories  discussed  in  Section  2 .  For  example,  FP  is  a  flammabil-
ity parameter; onset temperature is a thermal stability parameter.
The third perspective is to organize the thermal safety parameters
through their mathematical implications. Despite the varieties in
reactivity and scenario, thermal safety parameters can be summa-
rized into three types, the critical values related parameters (e.g.
critical time, critical temperature, critical concentration, and crit-
ical  energy),  the  change  (rise  and  loss)  related  parameters  (e.g.
mass  loss,  heat  release)  and  the  change  rate  related  parameters
(e.g. mass loss rate, heat release rate). As a categorization approach
highly recommended by these authors, this category is applied in
the followed-by step to designate each thermal safety parameter
into the definition of thermal risk.

3.3.2. Definition and estimation of thermal risks

To  simply  characterize  the  thermal  threats  of  reactive  chem-
icals,  many  authors  integrated  different  thermal  safety  parame-
ters into a more general criterion of “thermal risk”, by consider-
ing both probability (sensitivity) and severity of chemical’s thermal
runaway incidents [205] . Probability refers to  how  easily chemi-
cals can decompose with given amount of energy. Severity is about
the amount or speed of energy liberated during thermal decompo-
sition. Despite the varied thermal safety parameters, they all de-
scribe the thermal hazards of chemicals or processes in terms of
either probability or severity. Relating to the aforementioned pa-
rameter types, the critical value related parameters are probability
indexes, the change related parameters are severity indexes, and
the change rate related parameters can also be arguably regarded
as severity indexes since the change rate contributes to severity of
consequences. Therefore, it is possible to define a thermal risk by

selecting two or several thermal safety parameters. Table 7 sum-
marizes the typical definitions of thermal risks from existing stud-
ies. Detailed information are as follows.

In the 1990s, Ando et al. [160] discussed the relations of ther-
mal safety parmeters among 820 reactive materials, and identified
that  the  onset  temperature  and  heat  of  decomposition  were  in-
dependent of each other. Then Saraf et al. [206] proposed a two-
dimensional matrix with x-axis of onset temperature (probability)
and y-axis of heat of reaction (severity). The levels of thermal risk
were set from class I to IV. The matrix involved two critical values,

Magalhães et al. [76] applied the first DTG (first-order differen-
tial of TG) peak temperature and activation energy as severity and
probability, respectively. Four levels of thermal risks, low, medium,
high and very-high, were defined. Similar definition was applied by
Jones et al. [207] to evaluate the thermal risk of coal and biomass
fuels. Similarly, when conducting TG experiments in presence of
oxidation reactions, the first DTG peak temperature was defined as

mal risks were divided into three zones and marked by different
colors. Another three-level based thermal risk diagram was plot-
ted by Mage et al. [208] . The severity was expressed by the heat
release and the probability of occurrence was indicated with TD
24 .
In addition, Murasawa et al. [209] established a thermal risk dia-
gram for biomass fuels by considering three indicators, the onset
temperature, the heat of generation, and the amount of flammable
gases products. The onset temperature according to C80 measure-
ment was set into five levels. The total heat of generation obtained
by TAM at 50 °C after 72 hours was set into six levels. The risk
of flammable gas as a third indicator was defined according to the
gas concentration detected by gas chromatography, and shown by
circles with different diameters.

Besides the thermal risk diagrams, several normalized thermal
indexes  were  proposed  to  calculate  the  thermal  risks  and  rank
their levels. The earliest thermal risk index was defined by Stull
[142, 143 , 210] with a term of Reaction Hazard Index ( RHI ). It con-
sisted of an E a  as probability and a maximum adiabatic temper-
ature ( T m ) as severity. The equation of RHI is shown in Eq. (12) ,
where T m can be estimated by Eq. (13) . The units are as follows,
T m  and T on  (K), E a  (kcal/mol), C p  (J/mol K) and (cid:2)H (J/mol). The
RHI divided thermal risks into four levels as, Level 1 for RHI < 4,
Level 2 for 4 (cid:2) RHI < 5, Level 3 for 5 (cid:2) RHI < 6 and Level 4 for RHI
≥ 6.

Saraf et al. [206] proposed a Reaction Risk Index ( RRI ) to char-
acterize  the  thermal  risks  of  peroxide  and  hydro  peroxide  com-
pounds.  The  RRI  consisted  of  a  temperature  safety  ratio  ( τ )  as
probability, and the amount of energy released to the energy re-
leased by TNT ( β ’ ) as severity. The equation is shown in Eq. (14) .
T process  refers to the available thermal energy, T on  represents the
energy required for thermal activation, and τ is a measurement of
reaction rate.

Wang et al. [143] found the linear correlations between T on and

was above the onset temperature, they defined a Thermal Risk In-
dex of ( TRI ) through (cid:2)H and TMR

fined  ratios, β ’’  (measurement  of  reaction  severity)  and ε (mea-
surement  of  reaction  occurrence  probability). β ’’  was  defined  as
the amount of energy released by the substance for risk assess-
ment to the energy released by a reference compound. ε repre-
sented the adiabatic time to maximum rate of the same reference
compound to that of the substance used for risk assessment. The
formula is shown in Eq. (15) ,

where the unit of (cid:2)H is cal/g and the unit of TMR

equation was developed with Di-t-butyl peroxide (DTBP) as a refer-
ence compound for normalization, of which the values of (cid:2)H and
TMR
ad were 133 cal/g and 98 min, respectively. They characterized
the thermal risks into four levels based on the rules that, Level 1
for TRI < 1, Level 2 for 1 (cid:2) RHI < 2, Level 3 for 2 (cid:2) RHI < 3 and Level
4 for TRI ≥ 3.

Yang  et  al.  [211]  proposed  a  Thermal  Hazard  Index  ( THI )
through non-dimensionally processing of heat of reaction and on-
set temperature as indicators for severity and probability, respec-
tively.  The  methodology  was to  standardize T on  and  (cid:2)H  via  ris-
ing  semi-normal  distribution  and  descending  semi-normal  dis-
tribution  functions,  respectively.  The  calculation  of  THI  was  by
Eq.  (16) .  Five  risk  levels  were  defined  according  to  the  range
of  THI  among  79  compounds  as  follows,  Level  1  for  THI < 0.08;
Level 2 for 0.08 < THI < 0.17; Level 3 for 0.17 < THI < 0.34; Level 4 for
0.34 < THI < 0.45; Level 5 for THI > 0.45.

For  the  thermal  hazard  assessment  of  sulphide  mineral  ores
conducted by Busura et al. [212] , the core parameters of the global
thermal reactions ( A and E a ) were processed with a joint proba-
bility  rule  to  describe  the  probability,  and  the  enthalpy  of  reac-
tion was applied to evaluate the severity. The formula is shown in

Besides, Stoessel [213] developed a diagram with five critical-
ity classes to evaluate the probability of accidents. Four temper-
ature  levels  were  measured  for  assessment,  namely  the  process
temperature ( T p ), the maximum temperature of synthesis reaction
D24 and the maximum temperature for technical reasons
( MTSR ), T

( MTT ). Severity was defined by the energy of (cid:2)T
ad , the pressure
(for closed system), and the extension (for open system). Instead
of  using  a  single  index  formula,  Stoessel  considered  the  effects
of  cooling  failure  on  the  four  temperature  levels.  This  criticality
framework was implemented by the TRAS 410 German guideline as
a regulation for chemical’s hazard assessment [214] . The Stoessel’s
framework was further adopted by Jiang et al. [215] , who proposed
a new methodology to assess the thermal runaway risk of two step
synthesis reactions of both TBPB and tert-butyl peracetate (TBPA).
Each  reaction  step  was  assigned  with  a  risk  matrix.  The  maxi-
mum  adiabatic  temperature  rise  after  cooling  failure,  (cid:2)T
ad ,  was
assigned as severity, and the corresponding T
D24 was set as prob-
ability. Recently, the same research group [216] published a modi-
fied Stoessel’s critical diagram by considering the final temperature
( T
f ) to more reasonably evaluate the process safety. A latest work
by Pan et al. [217] applied the quantitative structure-property re-
lationships (QSPR) modeling to assess the thermal risk of organic
peroxides solely from their chemical structures. More information
about QSPR modeling will be presented in Section 4.1.1 . In their
work, probability index ( PI ) and severity index ( SI ) were defined
on basis of QSPR modeling of T on and TMR
ad , and QSPR model of
(cid:2)H , respectively. The final formulas are given in Eqs. (18) ~(19),

P I = 0 . 119 f 1 ( x 1 ) + 0 . 146 f 2 ( x 2 ) + 0 . 138 f 3 ( x 3 ) + 0 . 113 f 4 ( x 4 )

where f
i ) ( i = 1,2,3,4) is the
lar descriptors selected for probability, and g
dimensionless value of molecular descriptors selected for severity.
The constants were weights of corresponding descriptors. The the-
oretical calculated risks by this method were proved to be consist-
ing with both RHI and TRI collected by calorimetric experiments.
Five levels of risks were defined as, Level I for low hazard, Level II
for medium hazard, Level III for high hazard, Level IV for very high
hazard, and Level V for extremely high hazard.

The term of thermal risk index developed by both probability
and severity is a summative way to describe the thermal threats of
substances, and can be used for preliminary assessment for emer-
gency responses planning in industry [10 , 218] . However, there are
still  major  discrepancies  in  the  selection  of  particular  safety  pa-
rameter to define probability or severity, the choice of reference
chemicals  for  normalization, and  the  ranking  of  risks.  These  au-
thors will provide some outlooks as follows. For the selection of
thermal safety parameters to define a risk diagram or a risk in-
dex, Table 5 indicates that there are many possible combinations
between critical value related parameters and change/change rate
related parameters. The existing combinations listed in Table 7 are
far from enough. Further discussions regarding this topic are re-
quired. Particularly, existing studies rarely applied the parameters
related to fire behavior ( HRR , THR , Critical Radiant Flux) for risk
analysis. Please note that although each parameter can be desig-
nated  to  either  probability  or  severity,  sometimes  these  param-
eters  should  not  be  directly  used  to  define  a  thermal  risk.  Nor-
malization  with  proper  reference  material  is  required.  The  relia-
bility  of  some  parameters  is  also  questionable,  for  example,  on-
set  decomposition  temperature  can  be  greatly  influenced  by  the
calorimetric technique and sample size. Besides, certain perspec-
tives of safety may not be reflected in a two-dimensional thermal
risk diagram or index. When there are both self-heating decom-
position and explosion risks with a large amount of gas release,
both pressure increase and flammability of the gas [209] should

be  involved  in  a  diagram  or  an  index  to  describe  the  risk.  A
more detailed definition of risk may consist of three parts, with
the  formula  of,  Risk  =  Hazard  × Exposure  × Vulnerability  [219–
221] .  Such  formula  has  not  been  applied  to  estimate  the  ther-
mal  risks  of  reactive  chemicals.  For  the  selection  of  references
materials,  the  existing  choices  including  DTBP  [142 , 143 , 212 , 215] ,
TNT [206 , 212] , 2-Amino-4-Chlorophenol [212] , 2,6-Dichlorobenzoyl
chloride [212] and [215] have indicated the fact that there is no
single suitable reference material for all. Nevertheless it is possible
to develop a short list consisting of several candidate materials to
meet a particular definition, or to be applicable to a certain reac-
tive chemical family. The ideal reference materials should fulfill the
following requirements. To be first, the material should be readily
available in consistent purity, i.e. be commercially available. Sec-
ondly, the safety parameters of materials applied for risk definition
should be well established with known and reasonable uncertain-
ties [222] . In addition, it should be universally acceptable to all the
methods, software or instruments for calculation. Besides, the ther-
mal instability properties of reference materials should be exten-
sively studied and widely recognized. As for the rank of risks, with
the deficiency of standards, researchers can make some adoptions
from the flammability and instability hazard rating by the NFPA
704 [24] .

Recently,  a  new  perspective  to  estimate  the  thermal  risks
of  general  chemical  compounds  was  proposed  by  Mage  et  al.
[208] through data mining and model developing. The schematic
description of this methodology is given in Fig. 6 . Since each DSC
curve carries information of decomposition temperature and heat
of generation, similar DSC curves obtained under the same envi-

ronmental conditions can to some extent indicate similar thermal
stability  properties  albeit  the  specific  chemical  for  experiments.
The similarities in thermograms were explored by these authors
through data mining with a large number of DSC datasets collected
under the same procedure. The DSC curves were processed into a
hierarchical clustering with seven indexes, according to their dif-
ferences  in  onset  temperature  and  heat  of  generation.  Then  the
molecular  structures  and  their  corresponding  clusters  were  con-
nected  with  a  decision  tree.  For  new  compound,  its  DSC  curve
could be predicted by obtaining the Marrero-Gani groups and dis-
tributing  them  into  the  corresponding index  cluster.  In  addition,
the seven clusters were assigned into three levels of risks by a risk
diagram where the severity was expressed by the heat release and
24 . This work
the probability of occurrence was indicated with TD
provided new insights for thermal risk assessment among the big
reactive chemical family by merely analyzing the DSC profiles. Fur-
ther progresses can be made with help of the burgeoning intelli-
gent technology and a larger dataset obtained under other thermal
screening experiments.

4. Methodologies and tools for thermal hazard assessment

To  conduct  the  fundamental  steps  summarized  in  Section  3 ,
plenty of theoretical and experimental methodologies, as well as
engineering tools with specific application purposes have been de-
veloped. This section will review some popular methodologies and
tools in this field, according to their principles, application scenar-
ios, advantages and challenges.

4.1. Theoretical methodologies for thermal hazard assessment

As presented in Fig. 7 , the occurrence of thermal runaway in-
cidents,  and  fire  and  explosion  accidents  in  industry  could  be
attributed  to  both  the  inherent  property  (thermal  reactivity)  of
chemicals  and  the  effect  of  ambient  conditions.  On  one  hand,
since the inherent physicochemical properties of chemicals are de-
termined  merely  by  the  structure,  numerous  numerical  studies
have  been  conducted  by  targeting  at  how  structure  of  a  chemi-
cal could reflect its thermal reactivity. These studies will be intro-
duced in Section 4.1.1 , corresponding to the “molecular scale anal-
ysis” framework in Fig. 7 . On the other hand, environment condi-
tions can influence the thermal reactivity of chemicals due to the
heat  and  mass  transfer.  These  influences  can  be  mathematically
predicted by solving the three conservation equations, where the
physicochemical properties of chemicals determined from molec-
ular scale analysis are the fundamental inputs. The core purpose
of these mathematical simulations is to explore how the environ-
ment can influence the critical thermal runaway conditions. Rele-
vant studies will be reviewed in Section 4.1.2 , corresponding to the
summarized “mathematical simulations” framework in Fig. 7 .

4.1.1. Molecular scale analysis on basis of chemical structure

Molecular  scale  analysis  refers  to  all  forms  of  theoretical
methodologies  to  understand  thermal  reactivity  and  hazards  of
chemicals by merely considering the structure. Broadly speaking,
such analysis can be performed in forms of computational quan-
tum chemistry, molecular dynamics and empirical correlations and
so  on.  Benefiting  from  the  development  of  computational  facili-
ties and technologies, molecular scale analysis, especially advanced
molecular modeling has been successfully applied by researchers
to identify the potential reactivity of substances, and to predict a

series of physicochemical properties including some thermal safety
parameters.  This  section  will  discuss  these  methodologies  with
three sub-parts as follows.

Part I: Identification of potential thermal reactivity with quan-
tum chemistry theory

The easiest way to identify potential thermal hazards of chemi-
cals is to identify the particular thermally active functional groups
with existing knowledge. It is not a precise approach but has been
commonly used as a rule of thumb to qualitatively estimate chem-
ical’s  reactivity  [206] .  Ando  et  al.  [160]  validated  the  relation  of
thermal hazards and the functional groups through analysis of DSC
profiles of over 800 reactive materials. Results indicated that 98 %
of the chemicals with functional groups of organic peroxides, azo-
compounds, n-oxides and nitro compounds decomposed exother-
mically with thermal runway risks. To be more specific, -NO
2  is
an indicator for explosive nitro compounds; chemicals containing
-O-O- and -O-OH are mainly peroxide and hydrogen compounds
with  low  thermal  stability.  These  featured  function  groups  were
also used by the United Nation to define hazard class, e.g. the Class
5 under UN TDG [14] and class of “organic peroxides” under UN
GHS [16] . The Bretherick’s handbook [224] provides more detailed
description of reactive functional groups and their potential ther-
mal hazards within the entire reactive chemical family.

More  reliable  approach  to  identify  chemical’s  potential  reac-
tivity should be performed by computational chemistry with ad-
vanced tools [225] . Initially released in 1970s, the Gaussian soft-
ware  was  a  primer  computer  program  for  computational  chem-
istry. The name originates from Pople’s use of Gaussian orbitals to
speed up molecular electronic structure calculations [226] . It has
been continuously updated and widely applied for computational
chemistry  researches  since  then.  The  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  method

22

Q. Sun, L. Jiang and M. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100832

[227] and the Density Functional Theory (DFT) are two most pop-
ular numerical methods in computational chemistry to obtain the
reaction kinetics, thermodynamic properties and thermal decom-
position  pathways  [228] .  The  calculation  of  bond  of  dissociation
energy ( BDE ) is fundamental for these calculations. BDE refers to
the enthalpy change for the bond to cleave at certain temperature.
The calculation formula of BDE is, (cid:2)H
T (B) -
T (A-B), where H denotes the enthalpy of molecules or free rad-
H
icals [223] . Because the thermal decomposition of reactive chem-
icals normally occurs with the broken of the weakest bond, BDE
can be used to estimate the activation energy by the equation of
E a = γ p ( BDE ), where γ p is the positive transfer coefficient.

T (A-B) = H

T (A) + H

Featured functional groups determine the reaction properties of
chemicals, so the knowledge of structure not only helps to predict
thermal  hazards  of  a  particular  chemical,  but  contributes  to  the
understanding of potential effects of structure changes on its ther-
mal stability. The research conducted by Bian et al. [223] provided
an example. Through a series of BDE calculations with the Gaus-
sian software, they found that adding oxidized structures such as
p-benzoquinone and aldehyde groups of cured phenolic resin (PR)
could significantly reduce the BDE of C-C; and the thermal stabil-
ity of the C-C bonds in methylene bridge could be improved by the
formation of hydrogen bond in the O-O ’ type structure. Their cal-
culation explained the observed thermal stability of cured PR and
provided important insights for the development of polymers with
high flame retardancy. In the medicine development industry, or-
ganic peroxides are playing important role, and yet the inherent
instability  brings  potential  thermal  hazards.  A  relevant  study  by
Gome et al. [229] identified two sources of thermal risks of 1, 2, 4,
5-tetraoxane by calculating the (cid:3)E and (cid:3)G , and thus proposed a
structural modification method for thermal stabilization. By relat-
ing the BDE of important functional groups to varied temperatures,
another important application of computational chemistry is to de-
velop the thermal decomposition pathways. For example, Fayet et
al. [230] identified the pathways of the most energetically favor-
able reactions for o-nitrotoluene. The influences of substituents na-
ture (nitro, methyl, amino, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl) and po-
sition (from carbon 3 to carbon 6) on thermal stability could be
easily understood by the proposed pathways. In another case [231] ,
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with DFT was used to obtain
the initial thermal decomposition reactions of a synthesized ener-
getic  material,  TKX-50.  MD  simulations  indicated  that  the  initial
thermal process was the sequential proton transfer from hydroxyl-
amine to the bistetrazole moiety. The transfer occurred at a much
lower temperature comparing to the ring breaking reactions, and
provided the energy required for further decomposition. Therefore,
by preventing the proton transfer between cation and anion, it is
able to develop less sensitive azole-based high energy density ma-
terials.

In  summary,  the  identification  of  featured  functional  groups
and the calculation of BDE are two fundamental theoretical activi-
ties to estimate the thermal reactivity and develop decomposition
pathways at molecular level. Such studies normally target at one
particular  chemical,  and  the  findings  can  provide  important  in-
formation for the design of new materials or the modification of
the existing ones with particular thermal reactivity demand [232] .
Since  certain  structural  information  reflects  some  similar  physi-
cal and/or chemical properties, the sophisticated molecular scale
modeling methodologies were developed to estimate the proper-
ties of chemicals within a large set of chemicals from similar fam-
ily. These modeling studies are reviewed as follows.

Part II: Prediction of physicochemical properties by GC/GC + and
QSPR modeling

Appying  molecular  scale  modeling  methodologies,  such  as
group-contributions (GC), QSPR equations of states (EoS), COSMO-

RS/SAC, and molecular simulations (MS), to estimate the physico-
chemical properties of chemicals is quite popular in recent years.
GC and QSPR are two most popularly used methods among them
to predict the thermal properties of reactive chemicals, and will
be highlighted in the current review. Since a comprehensive peer-
review of relevant studies with these methods is already published
by Nieto-Draghi et al. [176] , this paper will introduce this topic by
citing some typical works since then.

As  an  empirical  method,  GC  modeling,  sometimes  called  as
structural  group  contribution  (SGC/GC)  modeling  or  molecular
group contribution (MGC) modeling, applies a sum of contributions
made by different blocks (representing different functional groups)
to describe the property of a molecule. Detailed information of this
method was provided by Poling et al. in a handbook entitled The
properties of gases and liquids [233] . The simplicity of GC modeling
has made it quite popular for engineering design. Recently, a mod-
ified method of GC + modeling was proposed [234 , 235] to improve
the description flexibility of thermodnamic properties of complex
systems. The concept of QSPR modeling was initially proposed in
the middle 19th century. After the first project proposed by Hansh
and Fujita [236] , constant progresses have been made in the im-
provement of molecular descriptors, the update of data processing
technology, and the design of validation tests. QSPR modeling was
also explicitly mentioned in the EU’s REACH Regulation [237] and
highlighted as a powerful method to predict the physicochemical
properties of chemicals.

The  fundamental  principle  of  QSPR  modeling  is  that,  simi-
lar molecular structures have similar properties and the structure
variations lead to differences in macroscopic properties, i.e. Prop-
erty = f ( descriptors ). The output of QSPR models is one or several
analytical  expressions  that  correlate  the  properties  of  molecules
by several computationally or experimentally derived parameters,
noted as the descriptors [238] . To some extents, GC modeling is
a  special  case  of  QSPR  modeling  since  the  chemical  descriptors
of QSPR modeling can be directly used as building blocks in GC
modeling  [239 , 240] .  Developing  QSPR  models  normally  requires
the  following  elements,  (1)  an  appropriate  selection  of  descrip-
tors in forms of constitutional, topological, geometric or quantum
chemical  [230] ,  (2)  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  chemical
structure via computational chemistry, (3) a large amount of re-
liable experimental dataset (divided into a training set and a val-
idation set), and (4) the application of advanced data processing
tools such as artificial neural networks (ANN), partial least-squares
(PLS), support vector machines (SVM), GA, multilinear regressions
(MLR) and nonlinear regressions (NL) [237] . Most recently, the in-
telligent technology of deep learning was applied to automatically
capture QSPR models and estimate physicochemical properties of
pure compounds [241 , 242] . A schematic overview of the formal-
ism of QSPR modeling is presented in Fig. 8 . More information of
QSPR modeling can be accessed in the handbook entitled Chemi-
cal thermodynamics for process simulation by Gmehling et al. [243] ,
as well as the handbook entitled A primer on QSAR/QSPR Model-
ing: Fundamental Concepts written by Roy et al. [238] . Numerous
GC/GC + /QSPR models have been proposed to estimate the physic-
ochemical  properties  of  pure  compounds  and  mixtures.  For  the
purpose of this paper, only properties related to thermal stability,
flammability and explosivity with interest will be reviewed.

To be first, many AIT models regarding both pure compounds
and mixtures have been developed by GC or QSPR modeling, to
name just a few, Hukkerikar et al. [235] , Suzuki [244] , Tetteh et al.
[245 , 246] , Taskinen and Yliruusi [247] , Pan et al. [248 , 249] , Frutiger
et  al.  [250] ,  Lan  et  al.  [251] ,  and  Shen  et  al.  [252] .  An  ANN-GC
based AIT prediction model developed by Gharagheizi [253] is in-
troduced with Fig. 9 to explain how the GC modeling works. The
AIT data of 1025 pure compounds from different chemical fami-
lies were applied for modeling. Similar to QSPR modeling, it con-

sisted  of  both  model  development  and  model  validation.  In  the
group  contribution  definition  stage,  the  molecules  of  chemicals
were  broken  down  into  a  certain  number  of  groups  on  basis  of
their contributions to the ignitibility property. The group contribu-
tions summed up to the property value of the entire molecule. 146
functional groups were found to have significant contributions to
the AIT prediction capability. Then a three layer Feed Forward Ar-
tificial Neural Network (FFANN) was developed to search for the
relationship between functional groups and the AIT . The results of
the developed GC models were validated against the experiments
to prove the accuracy. Besides pure compounds, QSPR models have
been gradually developed to estimate the AIT of mixtures. The re-

cent work by Lan et al. [251] explored the dependence of AIT on
the volume ratio of the fuel components with both experiments
and QSPR modelings. The model showed promising capability to
predict the AIT of binary miscible liquid mixtures as a function of
the ratio of the fuel components. In another QSPR modeling per-
formed by the same research group [248] , a novel statistical learn-
ing theory of SVM and a machine learning algorithm were applied
to model the nonlinear relationship between descriptors and AIT
for the first time. The performance of their models indicated the
potential of machine learning and similar newly developed intelli-
gent tools to estimate other properties of both pure chemicals and
mixtures via QSPR modeling.

The  applications  of  GC/GC +  and  QSPR  modeling  to  predict
flash  point  of  pure  compounds  and  mixtures  have  been  exten-
sively reviewed by Nieto-Draghi et al. [176] , Vidal et al. [254] , and
Gharagheizi et al. [255] . A few new FP prediction models on ba-
sis of QSPR have been proposed since then, by researchers such
as Gharagheizi et al. [256] , Alibakhshi and co-authors [257–259] ,
Álvarez  et  al.  [260] ,  and  Serat  et  al.  [261] .  Taking  one  piece  of
work  by  Gharagheizi  et  al.  [256]  as  an  example,  QSPR  model-
ing was applied to estimate the upper flash point of pure com-
pounds. A multi-linear equation with eight parameters was devel-
oped. The optimization of parameter was conducted through a GA-
MLR method among parameters collected from over thousand pure
compounds belonging to different chemical families.

For the prediction of LFL/LFLT and UFL/UFLT of chemicals, typ-
ical  QSPR  modeling  studies,  such  as  Gharagheizi  [262]  were  al-
ready summarized by Nieto-Draghi et al. [176] . A remarkable up-
date since then was conducted by Wang et al. [263] , who extended
the application of QSPR modeling to predict the LFLT s of gas mix-
tures. The same research group also conducted a series of molecu-
lar scale modeling for MIE of various chemicals. For the first time,
these authors developed a QSPR model to predict the MIE of hydro-
carbon fuels [264] . To sum up, there have been numerous studies
regarding the application of QSPR modeling for properties predic-
tion in recent years, largely due to the rapid development of com-
puter technology for data processing.

The prediction of thermal stability is also an interested topic
targeted  by  QSPR  modeling  researchers.  The  thermal  stability  of
chemicals is normally represented by onset temperature and heat
of decomposition. Many QSPR models have been successfully de-
veloped  to  predict  the  thermal  stability  of  nitroaromatic  com-
pounds and energetic materials [265–268] , organic peroxides [269–
271] , ionic liquids [272] and organic reactive chemicals in general
[273] . Besides, the SADT as an important thermal stability parame-
ter was also highly concerned for QSPR modeling. A few SADT es-
timation models have been developed by QSPR modeling to char-
acterize the self-heating potential of chemicals within certain fam-
ilies, including the publications by Pan et al. [249] , Liu et al. [268] ,
Gao  et  al.  [274] ,  Wang  et  al.  [275] ,  He  et  al.  [276] ,  Fayet  et  al.
[267 , 271] and Jitao et al. [277] . For the characterization of explo-
siveness of chemicals, relevant QSPR models have been developed
with varied perspectives, for instance the electric spark sensitivity
[278] , shock sensitivity [279 , 280] , friction sensitivity [281] , deto-
nation properties [282–284] and activation energy [285] . More re-
search progresses can be retrieved from a most recent review arti-
cle by Jiao et al. [286] , who summarized the development of QSPR
models within the past decade for the accurate and reliable predic-
tion of typical fire and explosion-related properties including UFL ,

vanced modeling approaches

The  sophisticated  QSPR  models  mentioned  above  can  predict
thermal  properties  of  a  wide  range  of  reactive  chemicals.  How-
ever, the development of QSPR models is an endeavor-needed pro-
cess, requiring the users to have professional backgrounds in both
quantum chemistry theory and experiences in applying advanced
software for data processing [287] . Recently, researchers began to
seek for easier approaches to predict the physicochemical proper-
ties with reliability. For the first time, Keshavarz [288] developed
a reliable and simple model to predict the condensed-phase heat
of formation of energetic compounds. In contrast to traditional GC
and QSPR modeling, this coding-free molecular modeling method-
ology showed satisfying prediction ability, and did not need com-
puter codes and complicated descriptors. In the past five years, Ke-
shavarz and co-authors have continuously extended this method-
ology  to  estimate  other  physicochemical  properties  of  chemicals

within certain family, including the heat of decomposition of ni-
troaromatics [289] , the temperature of maximum mass loss of or-
ganic azides [290] , the AIT of organic compounds containing en-
ergetic  functional  groups  of  nitro,  nitrate,  nitramine,  and  perox-
ide [291] , the onset decomposition temperature of cubic polyhe-
dral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) [292] , and both decomposi-
tion onset temperature and heat of decomposition of organic per-
oxides [293] .

Most  recently,  Suleiman  et  al.  [294]  proposed  another  sim-
ple property prediction method by combining hybrid support vec-
tor regression and gravitational search algorithm together, namely
the hybrid SVR-GSA method. It was initially introduced to predict
the AIT of organic energetic compounds. Compared with the ex-
isting  AIT  models,  this  hybrid  SVR-GSA  methodology  did  not  re-
quire  specific  functional  groups  as  descriptors,  and  significantly
outperformed the AIT model by Keshavarz et al. [281] and Chen
et al. [295] . The same research group has successfully applied this
method to predict the MIE of explosive chemicals [296] and heat
of detonation of aromatic energetic compounds [297] . The outputs
from these two publications all showed superior performance com-
paring to the prediction accuracy by existing sophisticated QSPR
models, or by Keshavarz’s simple models.

The prior property screening by GC/GC + modeling, QSPR mod-
eling and other theoretical methodologies enables the identifica-
tion of thermal hazards of chemicals merely from structure infor-
mation. These theoretical predictive methods provide the pertinent
complementary  opportunity  to  quickly  predict  the  physicochem-
ical  properties  of  substances  with  certain  reliability.  This  brings
insights  for  safety  design  of  new  chemicals  to  prevent  thermal
risks at the R&D level. Benefiting from the advanced data process-
ing  ability  of  computers,  simpler,  more  reliable  and  more  intel-
ligent approaches are burgeoning. However, some technical chal-
lenge need to overcome. To be first, most of the proposed molecu-
lar scale models only work well when predicting the physicochem-
ical properties of chemicals that have similar structures or under
similar situations with those chemicals applied for model develop-
ment. Therefore, both the development and validation of models
for  multicomponent  systems  should  be  further  investigated.  Be-
sides,  the  thermal  stability  and  fire  related  properties  are  not  a
function of molecular structure and decomposition pathway alone.
Improper selection of datasets can bring errors in the model, al-
though the validation results are acceptable. Fundamentally, the re-
lationships between sensitivity and heat capacity, heat conductiv-
ity, and decomposition temperature have not been fully considered
during QSPR modeling. Besides, there are limited discussions about
the  acceptability  of  existing  models  towards  the  regulatory  use
such as the OECD principles [176] , or the reliability when adopt-
ing these models to industrial practice. Finally, the development
of a robust molecular scale model requires a large amount of ac-
curate experimental data, and yet the availability of these data is
still challenging. Considering the thermal safety parameters listed
in Table 5 and the complicated reactivity of the big reactive chem-
ical  family,  major  effort s  in  molecular  scale  modeling  to  predict
thermal hazards of reactive chemical are still highly required.

4.1.2. Mathematical simulations with heat and mass transfer theories
Methodologies in Section 4.1.1 only consider the inherent prop-
erties  of  reactive  chemicals,  and  yet  the  thermal  risks  of  reac-
tive chemicals also depend significantly on environmental condi-
tions.  Besides,  scale-up  is  required  to  estimate  the  critical  ther-
mal safety parameters obtained by the aforementioned UN H2~H4
tests. Therefore, another important theoretical topic related to haz-
ard assessment is to simulate the thermal behavior of substances
by predicting the  critical thermal runaway conditions under  dif-
ferent scenarios. Factors including package size, sample mass, heat
and mass transfer and surroundings can be adjusted in these sim-

In Semenov model, temperature rise rate in a reaction system
is uniform. To satisfy this assumption, the liquid samples must be
well stirred or the air around the container must be well circu-
lated,  to  avoid  any  temperature  gradient  between  reacting  mass
inside and outside of the system. For system with temperature gra-
dient, a Frank-Kamenetskii model with Eq. (24) was proposed in-
stead to describe the heat balance,

Through a series of processing, the CAT or SADT of substances
in large dimension can be analytically calculated through Eq. (25) .
The  critical  ambient  temperature  is  influenced  by  both  proper-
ties  of  chemicals  and  the  differences  in  geometries  or  packages
with  Eq.  (26)  [156 , 158 , 305] .  Besides,  both  Semenov  and  Frank-
Kamenetskii  theory  are  only  applicable  to  the  determination  of
SADT s of TC type substances. For AC type chemicals, the explosion
limit is empirically a function of induction period [306] and thus
more sophisticated numerical simulations should be applied.

When samples are stored in large volume, heat generated dur-
ing reactions is unable to instantaneously exchange with surround-
ings. For such scenario, the self-ignition behavior of chemicals de-
pends on the characteristics of bulk materials, packaging and the
ambient conditions. More sophisticated numerical simulation ap-
proaches are required to solve the critical condition. Therefore, a
corrected F-K parameter with a Biot number was defined to simu-
late the heat convection in boundary [300 , 301 , 307] . The principle
is based on Eqs. (27) –(29) [116 , 118] ,

ulations to extend laboratory experiments to real situations. Kos-
soy  and  Sheinman  [154]  divided  these  theoretical  methods  into
two branches, the family of semi-analytical methods and the so-
phisticated numerical simulation methods. The major difference is
whether the critical parameters can be analytically calculated or
must be numerically simulated. By comparing the temperature gra-
dients between thermal system and the surroundings, three ther-
mal scenarios have been defined, i.e. Semenov model [38] , Frank-
Kamenetskii model [298] and Thomas model [299–301] . Illustra-
tions of these models are shown in Fig. 7 . Semi-analytical meth-
ods mainly refer to the former two well-known models. The self-
ignition or thermal explosion model was initially proposed by Se-
menov in 1920s with a heat balance equation for a lumped sys-
tem (with T uniform), and then modified by Frank-Kamenetskii for
transient heat conduction (distributed) system (with T gradients)
[298] .  Detailed  discussions  of  the  models  are  available  in  these
publications [302–304] . A brief review of their principles, assump-
tions and applications are presented below.

A primary application of the family of semi-analytical methods
is to obtain SADT of chemicals with different packaging. The heat
balance can be defined by the difference between the heat gener-
ation rate from the system and the heat transfer rate to the envi-
ronment via Eq. (20) ,

Relevant  models  built  by  the  equations  above  have  been  ap-
plied to simulate the critical thermal runaway conditions of coal
[64 , 308–314] , biomass piles [70 , 315] and metals [182 , 316] in con-
text of different reactor geometry (barrel or cubic box), boundary
conditions and environmental conditions. Wu et al. [312] compared
the capability of analytical models and numerical simulations by
predicting  the  self-ignition  parameters  of  coal  dust  samples.  Re-
sults indicated that the steady-state Frank-Kamenetzkii model and
an empiric Pseudo-Arrhenius (P-A) method have similar prediction
ability, but the more sophisticated numerical model is more reli-
able to evaluate the self-ignition temperature. Particularly, numer-
ical simulations can estimate the induction time of samples in in-
dustrial scales, and identify the influences of diverse factors, such
as storage temperature, shape of deposits, moisture and oxygen, on
self-ignition of coals.

In course of the rapid development of computer technology, nu-
merical  simulations  coupling  with  heat  and  mass  transfer  theo-
ries have become a matter of interest. These simulations can be
conducted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling soft-
ware [310] , Finite-Element-Code COMSOL Multiphysics [70] , open-
source tool Gpyro [64] , and some problem-oriented tools such as
the  AKTS-TA-Software  [154] ,  the  ThermEx  and  ConvEx  program
packages [154] and the Thermal Safety Software (TSS) [154] . Par-
ticularly,  CFD  modeling  has  been  primarily  applied  to  study  the
thermal behavior of coals from varied perspectives, such as the in-
duction time [310] , the effects of ventilation on spontaneous heat-
ing of coal [311] , the low-temperature oxidation of coal [313] , and
the influence of ambient variables [314] . COMSOL Multiphysics ap-
plies the built-in heat treatment physical fields and user defined
partial differential equations to solve heat and mass transfer prob-
lems [317] . For example, Ferrero et al. [70] predicted the heating-
up of wood chip piles with COMSOL. Three heat sources that may
contribute to the temperature increase inside the piles were con-
sidered  for  simulations,  including  a  chemical  heat  source  from
Arrhenius-type oxidations, a physical heat source related to evap-
oration/adsorption or condensation/desorption, and a heat source
from microbial exothermal reactions. Recently, a one-dimensional
computational model coupling heat and mass transfer, and chemi-
cal reactions was developed by Gpyro [64] , which accurately simu-
lated the self-ignition temperature of coal under both hot plate and
oven-basket  experiments.  It  is  impossible  to  list  all  the  relevant
studies due to limited paper length. However, in spite of different
software and tools, the fundamental principle of these mathemat-
ical simulation methodologies is to solve the conservation equa-
tions for mass, energy, and chemical species based on the mathe-
matical combustion theory.

4.2. Experimental methodologies for thermal hazard assessment

Theoretical  studies  enable  the  effective  prediction  of  reactiv-
ity of chemicals without conducting experiments. However, both
molecular scale modeling and theoretical simulations rely on ex-
periments to provide data for model development and validation.
Besides, laboratory experiments provide accurate first-hand data of
thermal hazard information. Hence it is the most commonly used
methodology to explore thermal threats of reactive chemicals.

A  large  number  of  experimental  techniques  are  available  to
characterize the thermal stability, ignitability, flammability and fire
behavior of chemicals, as summarized in Fig. 11 and Table 8 . These
techniques can be divided by different ways. Based on the scale
of sample applied in experiments, they range from microscale to
mesoscale experiments. Large scale experiments regarding reactive
chemicals are not recommended due to the consumption of sam-
ples and potential dangers. According to the primary purpose and
data outputs, these techniques can be chemical related ones and
thermal related (no chemical) ones. Chemical information mainly

refers to the structure change of condensed-phase components and
information of gases during thermal decomposition or combustion.
These techniques were often applied as basis for thermal decom-
position mechanism analysis. The thermal related datasets mainly
include mass loss, heat release, temperature of samples and pres-
sure change. In many cases, thermal and chemical related infor-
mation were simultaneously obtained through a single technique
or a manual combination of several techniques with some acces-
sories, such as thermocouples. These combinations are also sum-
marized in Table 8 . In the following content, some representative
experimental studies are reviewed to explain these techniques and
their combinations with two sub-sections, the thermal decomposi-
tion screening and chemical analysis experiments (where samples
are normally in milligram scale) in Section 4.2.1 , and experimental
methodologies to study the self-heating ignitability, flammability
and fire behavior of reactive chemicals (where samples are often
not thermally-thin) in Section 4.2.2 .

4.2.1. Microscale experiments for thermal decomposition screening
and chemical analysis

Calorimeter is the most common technique to obtain thermal
information of reactive chemicals or chemical process. Calorimeter
refers to both the setup used for thermal screening experiments
and  the  process  of  measuring  heat  of  reaction,  physical  change,
heat  capacity  and  other  thermophysical  properties.  A  variety  of
calorimeters are available, mainly including TG, DSC, Simultaneous
Thermal Analysis (STA), DTA, ARC, Reactive System Screening Tool
(RSST),  C80,  TAM  series,  Automated  Pressure  Tracking  Adiabatic
Calorimeter  (APTAC),  VSP/VSP2  and  so  on.  The  data  outputs  of
these techniques are summarized in Table 8 . Some techniques have
been  included  in  the  ASTM  as  standard  approaches  for  thermal
hazards  investigation,  to  name  just  a  few,  ARC  (E1981-98(2012)
[318] ),  DSC  (E537-12  [126] ,  E967-18  [319]  and  E2160-04  (2018)
[320]  and  TG  (E2550-17 [321] ).  ARC  as an  adiabatic calorimeter
is commonly used for safety analysis of reactors and pilot plants.
Different  from  DSC,  ARC  applies  the  heat-wait-seek  protocol  to
detect  self-heating  time,  temperature  and  pressure  change  dur-
ing exothermic reactions. Sun et al. [322] compared the sensitiv-
ity  and  temperature  region  of  DSC,  ARC,  C80  and  ARC.  DSC  has
the widest working temperature region among the four techniques,
and TAM has the lowest sensitivity. Besides, the maximum sam-
ple  loading  of  ARC,  C80  and  VSP  is  larger  than  other  adiabatic
calorimeters,  so  they  are  often  applied  to  investigate  the  self-
heating of full lithium ion batteries [323–326] . Four temperature
principles were often used, isothermal, isoperiodic, adiabatic, and
temperature-programmed heating. These methods record the data
of  heat  flow,  mass  loss,  or  pressure  release,  which  are  basic  in-
puts to conduct the fundamental steps involved in Section 3 . When
conducting experiments through thermal information-based tech-
niques, researchers should select the most suitable ones based on
the particular research purpose.

Several microscale techniques were often used together to ob-
tain a full understanding of thermal properties of chemicals. The
overall “DSC plus TG” method, as discussed in Section 3.2 , is the
most  popular  combination  till  now.  TG  provides  information  of
mass loss and corresponding temperature region, and DSC provides
the evolution of heat generation. The advanced combination via a
Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (STA), as a single technique, can si-
multaneously provide both heat flow and mass loss data. Pressure
detection techniques are required if the reactive chemical is highly
exothermic and can release a large amount of gases. For example,
both RSST and DSC were used by Wang [142] as preliminary anal-
ysis tools to study the thermal reactivity of some highly reactive
substances, and APTAC was applied for a detailed characterization
of pressure generation. As mentioned before, thermal decomposi-
tion experiments through apparatuses listed above were often con-

ducted in laboratory at mg-scale or g-scale. When it comes to in-
dustrial practices, theoretical scale-up by the principles mentioned
in Section 4.1.2 is required. For instance, NC as a thermally sensi-
tive and explosive chemical is often stored in bulk, but the auto-
catalytic reactivity and explosiveness of NC restrict the determina-
tion of its critical thermal runaway conditions through self-heating
experiments. Wei et al. [115] applied both experiments and simula-

tions to characterize its thermal hazards. Two thermal safety tem-
peratures, the critical storage temperature and the critical thermal
explosion temperature, were numerically analyzed. The former pa-
rameter was presented by TMR and TCL . The latter was calculated
by Eqs. (10) –(11) . The onset temperature recorded by DSC experi-
ments, and the activation energy obtained by inverse analysis were
applied as inputs to predict the critical condition. Similar research

methodology was applied by Lin and co-authors [116–119 , 201] to
analyze the thermal hazards of reactive chemicals from different
families.

Calorimetric techniques can follow up the heat balance during
decomposition and screen thermal hazards of reactive chemicals.
However, they are unable to identify the reactions. Therefore, ap-
paratuses focusing on chemical analysis were often used together
with  calorimeters  to  obtain  component-based  reaction  mecha-
nisms. The chemical analysis techniques could detect the evolved
gaseous components during thermal decomposition, or record the
change of chemical structures in condensed-phase. Fourier Trans-
form Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and GC/MS as two most popular
ones were often applied together with TG to obtain the gaseous
compounds  and  structural  changes  during  decomposition  [327–
329] .  Other  techniques,  including  XRD,  Nuclear  Magnetic  Reso-
nance  (NMR)  and  Raman  Spectrum  [330 , 331]  also  enabled  the
analysis of gases and/or condensed-phase components. For exam-
ple, a methodology of STA/XRD/Raman spectrum [331] was applied
to study the spontaneous combustion potential of sulfide miner-
als  powder  and  characterize  the  combustion  products  under  air
(mainly  FeO  and  Fe
3 )  at-
mosphere;  a  XRD  was  applied to  analyze  the  chemical  informa-
tion of a complicated explosive substance of “red oil” (the source
of fire and explosions during the PUREX spent nuclear fuel repro-
cessing) collected after C80 experiments [332] . Table 8 lists more
techniques, their possible combinations with thermal information
based techniques and their data outputs. Besides the detection of
chemical information, chemical analytic techniques may also indi-
cate the thermal stability. A relevant study was conducted by Luo
et  al.  [157] .  Since  onset  decomposition  temperature  differs  with
heating rates and sensitivity of calorimeters, these authors argued
that  using  calorimetric  techniques  directly  to  obtain  CAT  or  TDT
was not reliable. Alternatively, they collected structure change in-
formation through FTIR and GC-MS. The TDT of cotton was desig-
nated at around 210 °C due to the significantly increased absorp-
tion in C = O bond by FTIR and the release of a large amount of
gases observed by GC-MS.

4.2.2. Mesoscale experiments about self-heating ignitability,
flammability and fire behavior

Although the microscale techniques can detect thermal behav-
ior  of  reactive  chemicals  with  limited  sample  size,  the  amount
of  chemicals  in  industrial  practice  is  often  much  larger.  When
self-heating occurs, temperature gradients inside bulk of chemicals
could not be obtained by milligram scale experiments. To charac-
terize the self-ignition and combustion of chemicals accumulated
into  certain  volume,  mesoscale  experiments  with  larger  sample
loading are required.

By far the most scientifically informative experiments for self-
heating ignition is the standardized oven-basket test. The critical
oven  temperature  that  triggers  the  ignition  of  bulk  of  materials
is an important parameter for safety storage and transport of re-
active  chemicals.  In  oven-basket  tests,  chemicals  are  placed  into
mesh wire basket with certain volume [164 , 333] . Thermocouples
are usually placed at center of the basket, half of the distance be-
tween center and outer surface, and outside the basket according
to the particular research purposes. A balance is also installed to
record the mass change of sample during decomposition. The size
of basket varies based on the research purposes, e.g. Wang et al.
[164] explored the self-heating ignition behavior of coal in oven-
basket with coal pile heights changing from 2.5 cm to 10 cm (lab-
oratory scale) and from 25 cm to 100 cm (large scale). The bas-
ket tests can also be combined with aforementioned thermal and
chemical analysis apparatuses. For example, a hot-oven test cou-
pled with TG and FTIR [333] was used to explore the self-ignition

and smoldering characteristics of coal dust accumulations in both
O

2 atmospheres.

Another typical self-heating ignitability testing method, the hot
plate  test,  or  the  hot  surface  dust  layer  test,  is  designed  to  ob-
tain  the  minimum  ignition  temperature  of  a  dust  layer  with  a
given thickness [302 , 334] . It has a heating electric resistance with
a metallic plate on it. A metal ring with different heights is placed
on the hot surface, being filled with the dust layer. By setting up
thermocouples in different places of the dust layer and hot plate,
the temperature of ambient, dust layer and heated surface can be
recorded. Since both hot-plate and oven-basket tests are designed
to obtain the self-ignition condition, the theoretical relations be-
tween each other have been widely discussed. For example, a cor-
relation  was  obtained  by  Janes  et  al.  [302]  to  estimate  the  self-
ignition temperature of a dust layer on basis of hot-oven tests; and
a computational model was developed by Gpyro to predict the self-
heating ignition of coals under both tests [64] .

Reactive chemicals are generally storage in warehouses and in-
dustrial  premises,  so  understanding  their  fire  behavior  can  help
to  reduce  the  fire  and  explosion  in  these  places  or  assist  with
firefighting. The Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA) [335] and Cone
Calorimeter [336] are two most popular modern fire testing tech-
niques for now. Both apparatuses aim to provide information on
material’s flammability and fire behavior exposed to external heat
flux, including the time to ignition, the critical ignition heat flux,
the heat release rate, the combustion gases, and the mass loss and
so on. Accurate measurements of aforementioned information are
essential  to  extract  material’s  flammability  properties,  which  are
the basic inputs for fire behavior modeling under different scenar-
ios.  With  over  30  years’  history,  both  techniques  have  been  dif-
fusely used by the fire community to investigate fire behavior of
materials, particularly the construction products and building ma-
terials,  in  laboratory  or  in  large  burn  halls  with  heat  release  of
10~20 MW [336–340] .

Similarly  to  Cone  Calorimeter,  the  thermal  radiation  environ-
ment  provided  by  the  bench  scale  apparatus  of  CAPA  II  is  also
an  alternative  to  study  the  flammability  of  materials.  CAPA  II
was originally designed to facilitate analysis of pyrolysis of char-
ring and intumescent solids [341] . This apparatus (utilizing water-
cooled chamber walls) provides well-defined boundary conditions
and  highly  resolved  simultaneous  measurements  of  back  surface
temperature, mass loss, and shape profile evolution for a sample
exposed  to  a  given  radiant  heat.  The  radiation  supplied  from  a
conical electric heater was carefully characterized to account for
changes in the top sample surface position. The oxygen concen-
tration  on  the  sample  surface  was  maintained  below  1  vol.%  to
ensure that the sample decomposes under an anaerobic environ-
ment, which simulated a solid material burning under a contin-
uous diffusion flame. Through inverse analysis of milligram-scale
and CAPA II experiments with ThermaKin, Stoliarov’s group has de-
veloped a systematic methodology to characterize the pyrolysis of
polymeric solids. This methodology has been successfully applied
to capture the pyrolysis behavior of both non-charring [342] and
charring [343–345] synthetic polymers, composite materials [346] ,
and some polymeric materials containing multiple flame retardants
[47,95,96,98,347] .

Comparing to polymers, the fire behavior of reactive chemicals
is more complex due to the potential autocatalytic characteristics,
violent reactivity, oxidizing ability, potential explosiveness, and the
presence of hetero-atoms. For example, due to the presence of the
oxidizer,  fire  behavior  of  energetic  materials  differs  from  classic
solid fuels. Energetic materials do not require oxygen from the air
to support the combustion, so using oxygen consumption calorime-
ter  to  study  their  fire  performance,  particularly  to  calculate  the
HRR is precluded [348] . Biteau and co-authors have conducted a
series of experiments and analysis concerning this topic [349–353] .

In one study [352] , the HRR of energetic materials was calculated
by both Oxygen Consumption (OC) and Carbon Dioxide Generation
(CDG) principles. Results indicated that the HRR calculated by CDG
was higher than the one obtained by OC, due to the different lev-
els of completeness of the oxygen concentration and energy con-
stants calculation. These authors proposed a correction approach
for oxygen consumption and energy constants to obtain an accu-
rate estimation of HRR for the tested energetic materials. Further
verification and exploration is required towards the development
of generic constants that are applicable to other energetic mate-
rials. In another study by the same group [353] , the influence of
oxygen  concentration  on  combustion  behavior  of  a  fuel-oxidizer
mixture was investigated by FPA. They identified that the critical
oxygen concentration required by sample from air to sustain the
combustion was around 17 %. This critical value resulted in a tran-
sition of the flame regime from long diffusion flame to short pre-
mixed flame. Their studies also proved that the FM Global FPA is
a better tool, comparing to the Cone Calorimeter, to study fire be-
havior of highly reactive chemicals as it allows controlling the feed
of heat and oxidizer to the reaction zone. These researches pro-
vide insights for fire behavior research of other reactive chemicals
or mixtures with oxidizing property. More experiments should be
conducted to investigate the fire behavior of other reactive chemi-
cals.

Another  active  group  worth  mentioning  is  Eshetu  and  co-
authors, who have dedicated to the comprehensive understanding
of thermal stability and combustion behavior of reactive chemicals
applied in batteries, including carbonates-based electrolytes [354] ,
pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquids [355] and solvents used in elec-
trolytes for large scale lithium ion batteries [356] . These studies
were proposed in context of the booming of lithium ion batteries
in industry and the increasing demands for understanding fire be-
havior of these chemicals. A series of key parameters governing the
fire  induced  hazards  was  collected  through  combustion  and  fire
behavior tests. These indicators mainly included, the ease of igni-
tion (ignition time), the combustion-related energetic variables (ef-
fective heat of combustion and heat release rate), and the specific
mass loss rate and fire-induced toxicity (gas release). By combining
mesoscale and microscale experiments, the identified fire hazards
of  electrolytes  bring  important  values  for  realistic  and  industrial
applications.

Other researchers applying these techniques to study the fire
behavior of reactive chemicals mainly include, Kwot et al. [357] ,
who applied the INERIS’ FPA instrument to determine the fire be-
havior of sodium and potassium methoxides (classified by UN TDG
as  substances  liable  to  spontaneous  combustion)  and  their  solu-
tions in methanol; and Wei et al. [336] who applied an ISO 5660-
1 [358] Cone Calorimeter to study the fire characteristics of NC,
and recorded the flame height, heat release rate, mass loss rate,
flame temperature and critical radiant heat flux. They found that
with  limited  sample  of  4.5  g,  the  flame  height  of  NC  reached
over 80 mm once ignited. Comparing to the thermal power pro-
files  obtained  at  milligram  scale,  experiments  in  mesoscale  pro-
vided straightforward information about the fire behavior of NC.
In addition, targeting at both thermal runaway and fire behavior
of lithium ion batteries, Sun and Wang’s research group recently
developed  a  modified  cone  calorimeter  with  a  self-made  heater
[359] . This setup enables the measurement of temperature, voltage
variation, heat release rate and gas generation during combustion
of batteries.

MCC is also a flammability testing technique and has been a
mainstay in fire research laboratories [360–363] . MCC is also in-
cluded  in  ASTM  D7309-19  standard  [364]  as  a  primary  tool  for
flammability characterization of plastics and other solid materials.
The principle of MCC is to use controlled thermal decomposition
of specimens and thermal oxidation of the specimen gases as they

are  released  from  the  specimen  to  simulate  the  condensed  and
gaseous phase of flaming combustion. The output is the amount
of  heat  released  in  flaming  combustion  per  unit  mass  of  mate-
rial. MCC enables the determination of thermochemical informa-
tion, such as specific heat release rate, ignition temperature and
heat of combustion. This technique is quite popular in the field of
flammability studies of polymers. Currently, there are limited stud-
ies that applying MCC to characterize the flammability of reactive
chemicals.

Technically speaking, the fire behavior of chemicals within most
of the hazard classes included in both UN TDG and UN GHS can be
investigated by the techniques introduced above. The information
of mass loss, mass loss rate, heat release rate, total heat release,
critical  ignition  time,  critical  radiant  flux  and  combustible  gases
related  to  these  substances  are  important  to  understand  chemi-
cal’s thermal hazards. These data can also be further inversely an-
alyzed to obtain the kinetics, thermodynamics and to predict ma-
terial’s  fire  behavior  through  several  generalized  pyrolysis  mod-
els including the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) solid-phase model
[365] , FireFOAM pyrolysis model [366] , Gpyro [94] and ThermaKin
[113 , 114] . However, from the status quo point of view, investiga-
tions on fire behavior of reactive chemicals as dangerous goods are
far from sufficient. Existing works listed above are just the tip of
the iceberg, and continuous effort s are required to study the fire
hazards of the big reactive chemical family.

4.3. Engineering tools for thermal hazard assessment

4.3.1. Chemical reactivity and incompatibility analysis tools

Plenty of engineering tools enables the searching of chemical’s
reactivity. The basic property of chemicals, including their physical
hazards and safety precautions for handling, storing, and transport,
can be obtained from their Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) or
Safety Data Sheets (SDS) from hundreds of web sources. But these
datasets rarely provide comprehensive reactivity, thermal stability
and  fire  behavior  related  data  of  chemicals  under  different  sce-
narios. A few relevant handbooks have been published, involving
the fundamental information of chemicals’ reactivity. For example,
the Bretherick’s handbook of reactive chemical hazards [224] as a
must-have presents a worldwide unique reference work on reac-
tive properties and hazards. This handbook was originally written
by Leslie Bretherick, who was an internationally recognized author-
ity in field of laboratory safety research. The latest update of this
handbook  is  the  eighth  version  edited  by  Peter  Urben  and  pub-
lished in 2017.

To identify the unexpected reactions that may cause fire and
explosion  between  parries  of  substances,  a  chemical  incompati-
bility chart (sometimes called as compatibility chart or reactivity
chart) is a quite straight-forward approach. Understanding the po-
tential incompatibility of chemicals is also required by some reg-
ulations.  For  example  the  US  OSHA  Process  Safety  Management
Rule (OSHA 1910.119) required that reactivity information of highly
hazardous chemical should be gathered and listed by the rule. In-
compatible materials were forbidden to be stored or transported
together  by  relevant  regulations.  As  a  long  term  topic,  numer-
ous chemical incompatibilities charts are available. A very simple
chemical incompatibility chart according to the UN TDG classifi-
cation was presented with 14 categories, designated to a decision
of either compatible (Y) or incompatible (N) [22] . With focus of
environmental risks, a hazardous waste incompatibility table was
proposed for chemicals from 25 categories with 9 incompatibility
decisions [367] . A larger chemical incompatibility table with 100
different  segregation  groups  was  proposed  by  Winder  and  Zarei
[25] , who combined different segregation systems in accordance to
chemical’s flammability, water incompatibility and other character-
istics. Regarding the preparation of compatibility charts, the ASTM

30

Q. Sun, L. Jiang and M. Li et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100832

E2012-06 (2012) standard entitled Standard Guide for the Prepara-
tion of a Binary Chemical Compatibility Chart [368] provided acids
for the accurate assessment of chemical compatibility, the suitable
experimental  techniques  for  gathering  compatibility  information,
the incorporation of user-friendliness, and the provision for revi-
sions [99] .

From above, an incompatibility table can be very simple with
several  rows  and  columns,  or  be  quite  complicated  with  a  very
detailed classification of chemicals with structure differences. The
complexity level is related to the particular classification standards
for  chemicals.  It  is  quite  easy  to  prepare  or  understand  a  sim-
ple  compatibility  chart,  but  the  limited  dimensions  lead  to  in-
convenience when dealing with the big reactive chemical family.
Several advanced chemical incompatibility analysis software have
been developed to overcome this problem. In the CRW 4.0 soft-
ware offered by the NOAA, the complicated incompatibility rela-
tions among over thousands of chemicals can be easily analyzed
through the embedded chemical reactivity worksheets. Three com-
patibility decisions, “compatible”, “incompatible” and “caution”, are
defined. On basis of the same classification system, the software of
CAMEO (with full name of Computer-Aided Management of Emer-
gency Operations) Chemicals also enables the drawing of compat-
ibility charts. Note that CAMEO Chemicals is a part of the CAMEO
software family offered by both NOAA and EPA. Beyond the out-
puts of incompatibility charts, CAMEO Chemicals is also capable of
predicting the possible reactions if chemicals are mixed.

The screening tool of Chemical Thermodynamic and Energy Re-
lease Program (CHETAH) is also a recommended tool for evalua-
tion of energy release and thermodynamic properties. It has been
coordinated by the ASTM E27 committee for many years [99] . The
program is developed with the Benson’s group contribution tech-
nique, which only applies molecular structure information for anal-
ysis. The major actions supported by CHETAH include, the classifi-
cation of a chemical or mixture according to the ability to decom-
pose, the access to a thermochemical database, the calculation of
thermochemical properties, and the estimation of thermal hazards
for reaction and compounds. The hazard assessment is conducted
by calculation of lower flammable limits, minimum ignition tem-
perature, limiting oxygen concentrations, and maximum adiabatic
fame temperature and so on. From simple chemical incompatibility
charts to advanced software, the compatibility analysis approaches
are becoming more powerful owing much to the boom of com-
puter science and technology. The foundation of these approaches
are closely related to the classification of chemicals, i.e. the physi-
cal hazards and hazard classes. Therefore, progress can be further
achieved by coupling the incompatibility with thermal hazards of
reactive chemicals from different categories.

4.3.2. Accident learning and decision-making tools

Accident  research  is  not  a  new  topic.  The  founder  of  mod-
ern  accident  research,  Bortkiewicz,  argued  in  the  late  18th  cen-
tury that the accidents occurred at random and were inexplicable
[369] . Till now, numerous accident databases and accident analy-
sis tools/software have been developed for the purpose of learning
from  past  accidents,  or  predicting  the  development  of  incidents.
These databases can be in national or in international levels. In Eu-
rope, the most popular database is Major Accident Reporting Sys-
tem (MARS, which is renamed as eMARS after going online) [370] .
MARS was created at 1984 within the framework of EU directive
82/501, the so-called “SEVESO” directive. It registers all the major
industrial accidents notified to the EN authorities and OECD mem-
bers. The database comprises of a “short report” with immediate
notification  of  accidents  and  a  “full  report” after  fully  investiga-
tion. Other industrial accident database in Europe mainly include,
the  ZEMA  in  Germany,  the  ARIA  in  France,  the  AEA  technology
MHIDAS (Major Hazards Incident Data Service) database in UK, the

TNO FACTS (Failure and Accidents Technical information System)
database  in  the  Netherlands,  the  World  Offshore  Accident  Data
(WOAD) and so on. Note that both MHIDAS and FACTSare interna-
tional database that collect over ten thousands of industrial acci-
dents during processing, transport and storage of hazardous goods.
The  US  has  only  one  official  accident  database  in  federal  level,
i.e. the US Accident Reporting Information System (IRIS). There are
several accident databases in Japan, such as the Failure Knowledge
Database and the Relational Information System for Chemical Acci-
dents Database (RISCAD). China has three official chemical safety-
related databases affiliated to different departments [371] , namely
the  Accident  Inquiry  System  (AIS),  the  Chemical  Accident  Cases
(CAC), and the Daily Accidents Information (DAI). More discussions
about accident databases are available in these papers [370 , 372] .

Besides accident database, lots of software have been developed
concerning  accident  evolution  prediction,  fire  rescue  and  emer-
gency response. These tools generally integrate gas dispersion, fire
and  explosion  models,  and  are  often  linked  to  geographical  in-
formation system for decision-making [373] . Several typical soft-
ware  tools  are  named  as  follows.  The  Quantitative  Risk  Assess-
ment (QRA) enables a quantitative risk assessment for transporta-
tion of dangerous goods in road tunnel. The OSIRIS risk simulation
tool [373] is a user-friendly software for the training of firemen
or manufacturers of dangerous raw materials. OSIRIS enables the
simulation of fire, explosion, toxic gas dispersion and leakage inci-
dents. The TerExis also enables the evaluation of immediate con-
sequences of accidents of dangerous substances. With connection
to the geographic information system, TerExis enables the risk as-
sessment and emergency planning by modeling the worst possible
consequence. BREEZE is a premier provider for dispersion modeling
analysis. Currently, the BREEZE software has many sub-software or
tools with different functions, such as accidental hazardous release
modeling, fire and explosion modeling, and explosion consequence
modeling and so on. The software family CAMEO is also a power-
ful tool to assist management of hazardous materials. CAMEO con-
sisted of four sub-programs, CAMEO fm , CAMEO Chemicals, ALOHA,
and MARPLOT. In addition to the CAMEO Chemicals introduced in
Section 4.3.1 , other three programs support accident researches in
different perspectives. The feature of CAMEO fm is to manage data
of chemicals stored or transported in the near community. ALOHA
is a modeling tool to estimate the traveling of splatted chemical
clouds and some types of fire and explosion incidents. MARPLOT
is a mapping tool to estimate the geospatial information for emer-
gency incidents and develop custom maps. As a simple-to-use tool,
CAMEO can be applied by website, desktop program as well as mo-
bile APPs of both iOS and android system.

Some researchers used the term of Decision Support Systems
(DSSs)  instead  to  describe  the  relevant  engineering  tools.  DSS
refers to the various management tools that support decision mak-
ing  to  find  the  most  adequate  strategic,  tactical  and  operational
solutions to reduce both accident probability and potential conse-
quences. A comprehensive DSS consists of the following modules,
GUI (Graphical User Interface), GIS (Geographical Information Sys-
tem), DBMS (Data Base Management System), MBMS (Model Base
Management System), Generator of alternatives, and MCDA (Deci-
sion Model-Multi Criteria Decision Aid). More DSS systems towards
safe transport of hazardous materials have been reviewed by Tor-
retta et al. [374] and will not be repeated here.

Previous analysis of various industrial accidents carried out by
different researchers [375–377] all indicated the same rule that, a
large quantity of accidents were caused by errors in design. There-
fore, it is important to take advantage of past accident information
and disseminate them directly into safety design. General methods
for chemical process safety evaluation in the design stage include,
Failure Mode and Effects analysis (FMEA) [378] , Hazard and Oper-
ability Study (HAZOP) [379] , semi-quantitative method of layer of

31

protection (LOPA) [380] , and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) [381] and so
on. Limitations and advantages of these methods were comprehen-
sively reviewed by Kidam et al. [382–384] . Typical frameworks fo-
cused specifically on fire and explosion risk assessment include the
Chemical Runaway Reaction Hazard Index (RRHI) [385] , the Dow’s
Fire and Explosion Index (FEI) [386] , and the Fire and Explosion
Damage Index (FEDI) [387] and so on. More information of rele-
vant safety indices for process safety assessment can be accessed
from the comprehensive review provided by Roy et al. [388] .

5. Final remarks and recommendations for further research

Ultimately, learning from existing studies related to the assess-
ment of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals in the past three
decades,  this  article  summarizes  the  common  ground  that  has
been highly focused by researchers in relevant fields, and presents
a comprehensive review of current status, challenges, and perspec-
tives  of  research  topics  in  future.  The  issues  of  interest  mainly
include  the  classification  and  thermal  characteristics  of  reactive
chemicals, fundamental steps towards the comprehensive assess-
ment of their thermal hazards, and the applied methodologies to
conduct these steps.

Talking  about  the  future  topics,  this  article  lays  emphasis  on
the prospect of process safety in the context of Industry 4.0. As a
new conception from the modern industry, Industry 4.0 has been
increasingly highlighted [389–391] . Industry 4.0 applies informa-
tion  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  and  internet  of  things
(IoT)  to  improve  productivity,  reduce  risks,  control  environment
and  enhance  the  productivity  intelligence  in  industry.  Moktadir
et al. [392] discussed the implications of Industry 4.0 for process
safety, and argued that new technologies such as advanced simu-
lations, cloud computing, data mining and machine learning could
efficiently assist with the safety management. Since thermally haz-
ardous substances are the primary sources of fire and explosions
in industry, effort s towards the comprehensive assessment of ther-
mal hazards of these chemicals play vital role to fulfill the Industry
4.0. According to this background, the conception of Industry 4.0 is
considered by these authors to make recommendations for further
researches.

As  the  first  remark  of  this  review,  the  classification  schemes
recommended by both UN TDG and UN GHS are focused and com-
pared according to their classification principles, features and limi-
tations. Both regulations provided well-defined hazard classes, cat-
egory and testing criteria. Although the UN regulations have been
internationally adopted and increasingly implemented by many au-
thorities to classify hazardous chemicals, effort s are still required
to  achieve  a  more  throughout  harmonization  of  existing  regula-
tions. It is recommended that such harmonization should be pri-
marily achieved by combining the physical hazard classes of ex-
isting regulations, and further be conducted by improving the in-
depth consistencies (e.g. the definition and description of reactiv-
ity, the ranking system of hazard category, the test procedures and
relevant criteria etc.) in global level. The ICT and IoT of Industry 4.0
can bring valuable help to achieve these purposes. This is primar-
ily a technical and political topic, and yet many scientific problems
need to overcome.

Both UN TDG and UN GHS referred to the underpinning phe-
nomenology  of  reactivity  as  basis  to  classify  chemicals’  physical
hazards. The varied forms of reactivity often lead to traps and pit-
falls when dealing with some typical reactive chemicals. The limits
due to threshold values set by pure “convention” may bring dis-
cordance when define the hazard class of some chemicals whose
property values are near the setting limits. One more thing, there
are  no  specific  classifications  with  regard  to  the  big  energetic
material family and biological source family, although these sub-
stances have high tendency to cause fire and explosion accidents in

industry. The complexities in reactivity have made the hazard clas-
sification quite challenging. Therefore, having comprehensive un-
derstanding of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals is an essential
step towards the throughout harmonization of classification regu-
lations.

The classification of reactive chemicals is closely linked to the
assessment of their thermal hazards in many ways. Fig. 12 sum-
marizes the interlaced relations between and among the big re-
active chemical family, sub-families of reactive chemicals, hazard
classes  and  divisions,  forms  of  thermal  reactivity,  thermal  safety
parameters, thermal risk indexes and ranking, chemical incompati-
bility and molecular scale modeling. As discussed in Section 2 , the
big reactive chemical family can be divided into many sub-families
(e.g. organic peroxide family, family of nitro compounds) accord-
ing to the domain structure and relevant thermophysical proper-
ties. Each chemical from one sub-family may contain several ther-
mal reactivity phenomena (i.e. physical hazards), such as the spon-
taneous combustion tendency, flammability and explosiveness po-
tential. These phenomena were applied by the UN to classify reac-
tive chemicals into several classes, and each class was divided into
several divisions. Therefore, their relations can be analyzed with
two perspectives. On one hand, the thermal reactivity phenomena
can be characterized by a set of probability and severity related
thermal safety parameters, which further define the thermal risks
of the phenomena. For the ranking of risks, although there is no
international standard for now, it is somewhat related to the divi-
sion of classes regulated by UN. On the other hand, the develop-
ment of GC/QSPR models is based on chemical’s structural infor-
mation, which determines the classification of sub-families. Since
the ultimate purpose of these models is to predict the thermophys-
ical properties of reactive chemical, which further contribute to the
calculation of probability related thermal safety parameters, sever-
ity related thermal safety parameters and thermal risk indexes, it
is possible to develop thermal risk indexes through molecular scale
modeling. Some progresses have been made by Pan et al. [217] to
evaluate the thermal risks of the organic peroxide family through
QSPR modeling. This is a field at the early stages of development.
From  Fig.  12 ,  there  are  many  potential  research  topics  from  the
classification of reactive chemicals to the assessment of their ther-
mal hazards. All the relations with question marks have not been
fully understood.

Towards the comprehensive assessment of thermal hazards of
reactive  chemicals,  three  fundamental  steps  as  common  ground
were widely focused by previous researchers, namely, to identify
the  reaction  mechanisms,  to  calculate  the  reaction  kinetics  and
thermodynamics, and to characterize the thermal safety properties
by appropriate thermal safety parameters, thermal risk diagrams
and risk indexes. When it comes to reaction mechanisms, distin-
guishing the general n -th order decomposition from autocatalytic
reaction is fundamental for the followed-by assessment steps. Var-
ious thermal safety parameters have been proposed, which can be
summarized into three types according to the mathematical mean-
ings. This article designates the parameters into thermal risk in-
dexes as follows, the critical values related parameters (designated
as probability), change related parameters (designated as severity),
and change rate related parameters (designated as severity). Note
that the summarized three-step strategy is also recommended as a
framework to understand the thermal hazards of new chemicals in
future.

To achieve the objectives involved in the three-step framework,
plenty of theoretical, experimental and engineering methodologies
have been developed. Theoretical studies can performed by merely
considering the molecular structure with computational quantum
chemistry. Both GC modeling and QSPR modeling have been suc-
cessfully  applied  to  estimate  the  thermal  properties  of  reactive
chemicals within certain chemical families. The other theoretical

perspective  is  to  relate  the  chemical  reactivity  to  defined  ambi-
ent  and  predict  the  critical  thermal  conditions  through  numeri-
cal or analytical calculations. Existing experimental methodologies
are  proposed  with  different  primary  purposes,  mainly  including
the calorimetric screening of thermal stability, the investigation of
self-ignition  tendency,  the  detection  of  condensed-phase  compo-
nents and gases, and the characterization of materials’ flammabil-
ity  and  fire  behavior.  At  microscale,  calorimeters  have  been  the
most  popular tools  to  screen thermal stability of  chemicals,  and
are  often  applied  together  with  chemical  analysis  techniques  to
develop  a  conjectured  decomposition  mechanism.  At  mesoscale,
studies  focusing  on  chemicals’  self-heating  ignitability  are  quite
common,  mainly  through  standard  hot-plate  test  or  oven-basket
tests. Flammability and fire behavior related techniques, mainly the
Cone Calorimeter and FPA, have not been widely applied to study
the fire hazards of reactive chemicals. The engineering tools that
support chemical property search, chemical incompatibility predic-
tion, accident analysis, safety assessment and decision-making are
also included in this review.

The constantly evolving science of thermal hazard assessment
of reactive chemicals is facing with many challenges, not only from
the interpretation of volume of data being generated with new in-
novative technologies, but also in attempting to quantitatively in-
corporate these information and technologies into comprehensive
assessment of potential fire and explosions in industrial level. The
scale-up fire safety research from laboratory analysis to real world
has been a hot topic and highlighted at the ISO TC92 level by the
Fire Safety Committee. Under this background, this review lays par-
ticular  emphasis on the  scale-up studies  regarding the big  reac-
tive chemical family. Comparing to the constructions and building
materials  which  have  been  widely  investigated  by  the  fire  com-
munity for many years, scale-up studies regarding reactive chemi-
cals are quite limited. The complex reactivity of chemicals further
widens the gaps between laboratory and industry. Considering the

current state of the art and the prospect of process safety in Indus-
try 4.0, a graphic abstract is plotted as Fig. 13 to show where we
are and where we should go towards the comprehensive assess-
ment of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals. Some perspectives
and recommendations for further researches are presented as fol-
lows.

For each fundamental step summarized in Section 3 , many re-
search gaps should be filled up. First, simple and reliable meth-
ods should be developed to identify the AC type chemicals which
contribute  to  a  majority  of  the  big  reactive  chemical  family.  In-
verse analysis of experimental data as a reliable approach should
be highlighted when calculating kinetics and thermodynamics of
chemicals  with  autocatalytic  reactivity.  The  accuracy  of  kinetics
and thermodynamics directly determines the reliability of the cal-
culated thermal safety parameters and risk indexes. Some neces-
sary research topics have been proposed in relevant sections. As
final remarks, the disparities in the selection of thermal safety pa-
rameters, the definition of risk indexes, the ranking systems, and
the applied reference materials for normalization should be fully
studied with large datasets and be carefully handled by relevant
authorities  and  committees.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  re-
searchers refer to the terms listed by well-known authorities, such
as UN TDG, UN GHS, ASTM E27, and NFPA 704 as much as possi-
ble. Otherwise authors should provide reliability analysis of their
results and, more practically, provide emphasis on how their pa-
rameters can be used for hazard characterization and safety con-
trol of chemicals in industrial practices. Although advances have
been observed in the development of thermal safety indices, their
applications remain subjective in nature [388] . More sophisticated
thermal risk indexes should be developed by coupling the thermal
safety parameters from multiple perspectives, e.g. self-heating, ox-
idizing, gas releasing and explosiveness properties. Note that the
standardization  of  methods  for  mitigating  the  fire  risks  of  haz-
ardous materials has been included by the ISO TC92, in program of

long term standardization of fire safety in support of performance-
based design. The current review further emphasizes the impor-
tance of this topic with regard to the standardization of thermal
safety properties of the big reactive chemical family.

Fig. 13 describes how a small amount of reactive chemicals are
linked to the entire chemical industry. Reactive chemicals are often
stored in different kinds of containers, which are then arranged in
warehouses. Together with other kinds of chemicals, these contain-
ers and warehouses form an industrial park. If one reactive chem-
ical underwent thermal runaway and the situation was not effi-
ciently controlled, a “domino effect” would occur [393] . Studying
the  collapse  of  this  “domino” phenomenon  from  thermophysical
perspectives can help to understand how the reactivity (thermal
stability, spontaneous combustion tendency, etc.) of chemicals con-
tributes to small scale fires, and how the fires evolves into dra-
matic fire and explosion accidents in industrial level. The findings
will also help to find the best arrangement of containers in chem-
ical warehouse, or the proper layout of warehouses to prevent ac-
cidents in industrial parks. Relevant studies are greatly benefitable
to the process safety, loss prevention, firefighting and emergency
response of users who need to deal with thermally reactive chem-
icals. Both experimental and theoretical studies corresponding to
this topic are far from enough.

For  experimental  researches,  bench  scale  fire  tests  by  Cone
Calorimeter and FPA (a recommend one) should be performed to
understand the flammability of reactive chemicals. These experi-
ments are not included in the UN’s H series tests, and yet demands
are increasing by the modern chemical warehouses and industrial
parks, particularly by the booming of new fuel and energy related
industries. The major technical challenge here is the calculation of
HRR, since it depends significantly on inherent oxidizing property
during  combustion.  Theoretically,  the  physical  field  of  milligram
experiments is controlled by thermal conductivity because chem-
icals are thermally-thin. However, thermal conduction, convection,
and radiation all exist in medium and large scale fires. The change
in dominant physical fields should be emphasized for scale-up. It
is necessary to develop more sophisticated simulation models by
considering all the physical fields.

The  bottommost  element  for  the  comprehensive  understand-
ing of reactive chemicals is a large dataset of chemicals’ thermal
safety properties. The rise of advanced data processing, and most
recently,  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligent  technologies
in  Industry  4.0  have  brought  new  perspectives.  These  advanced
methodologies can be the stepping-stone to develop more compre-
hensive database, more advanced analysis tools, and simpler and
more reliable theoretical models related to the hazard assessment
of  thermally  reactive  chemicals.  As  stated  in  Section  4.1.1 ,  some
successes of simpler and more reliable molecular scale modeling
have been achieved under the umbrella of these techniques. Much
need to be done within larger reactive chemical families.

In the long run, on basis of the big thermal property dataset
and  advanced  data  processing  techniques,  sophisticated  thermal
safety database for reactive chemicals could be developed to bet-
ter  assist  the  fire  and  explosion  prevention  and  safety  control
in  industry  [394] .  An  ideal  up-to-date  database  should  at  least
cover the thermophysical property, chemical incompatibility, ther-
mal safety parameters from different reactivity perspectives, ther-
mal risk indexes and data related to flammability and fire behavior
under typical fire scenarios. Besides, it should integrate advanced
searching  functions  and  be  available  online.  One  encouragement
regarding the database development is that, there have been sev-
eral handbooks containing the fire safety relevant data of some re-
active chemicals, such as the SFPE handbook of Fire Protection Engi-
neering by Hurley et al. [395] , the Ignition handbook by Babrauskas
[396] and the Bretherix’s handbook of reactive chemical hazards
[224 , 397] . The ICT and IoT of Industry 4.0 may help to collect ex-
isting datasets and integrate them into more advanced ones.

Another recommendation is the development of standard and
robust systematic assessment methodologies and tools, which suf-
ficiently enable the thermal hazard assessment of reactive chemi-
cals under different scenarios. Although numerous theoretical and
experimental  methodologies  as  well  as  engineering  tools  have
been proposed, many of them were designed with particular sce-
nario and were not very convenient for general users. There is no
standard and robust systematic framework which sufficiently con-
ducts the thermal hazards and thermal risks assessment of reac-

34

tive chemicals by considering varied scenarios. An ideal assessment
methodology should at least have the following features 81 , [398] ,
(1) characterizing the thermal properties by considering inherent
properties,  chemical  incompatibility  and  environment  factors  to-
gether; (2) applying robust safety parameters and standard thermal
risk indexes to define thermal properties and indicate the thermal
threats  of  chemicals  under  different  scenarios;  (3)  being  able  to
dynamically predict the evolution of fire and explosion incidents
with  environment  change  in  storage  houses  or  the  in  industrial
parks, and providing instant instructions for emergency response;
and (4) being simple to use by operators with limited coding or
quantum chemistry background. As a fundamental framework, the
three steps summarized in this article may bring some values to-
wards this topic. Of course, such methodology, either in forms of
software or cloud platform, can only be developed once the rel-
evant scientific research gaps are solved. As the final remark, the
proper assessment of reactive hazards requires regulatory, techni-
cal and methodological assessments to corporate together [12] . The
prospect  of  thermal  safety  in  Industrial  4.0  is  a  dynamic  socio-
technical system at global level [399 , 400] . Each stakeholder within
the  system,  including  hazardous  process,  researchers,  operators,
staff, management of company, control authority, government, as-
sociations,  public  pressure  and  market,  should  take  on  their  re-
sponsibilities and act as a whole.
