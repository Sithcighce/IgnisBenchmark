Turbulence is an effective way to spread particles and drops in a fluid, which is critical for many energy systems,
ranging  from  carbon-based  power-production  to  spray  cooling  for  renewable  energy  storage.  Combining  the
intricacies of turbulence with the complexities of particle motion has led to numerous advances, especially in the
last two decades in terms of turbulent bias, and turbulence modulations, as well as experimental confirmation of
previous theories regarding turbulent diffusion and turbulent particle collisions. In this review, the fundamental
features of turbulence are related to key Stokes numbers that describe one-way coupling (influence of turbulence
on particle motion). This includes turbulent diffusivity for a range of inertias and drift parameters, as well as new
work that describes the kinetic energy of particle velocity and of particle relative velocity. Turbulent biases are
then reviewed including non-linear drag bias, preferential bias, clustering bias, diffusiophoresis and turbopho-
resis. Next, recent progress in turbulence modulation and particle collision frequency are discussed. Finally, a
generalized flow regimes is presented to summarize the interactions as a function of particle size and particle
concentration.

1. Multiphase flow in energy systems

Energy systems often includes multiphase turbulent flow, including
those that used carbon-based fuels and those that are based on renew-
able energy.

For ground-based energy production from combustion of natural gas,
the products can include soot particles which are generally filtered from
the exhaust gases. For coal combustion, soot particles and ash can be
formed but multiphase flow aspects are also involved in the fuel feed and
fluidized bed regions. In these facilities, particle filtering in the turbulent
flows is even more important. A common approach is to employ cyclone
filters, which use centrifugal and gravity forces to achieve separation of
the particles from the gas stream.

Air-breathing  power  and  propulsion  systems  generally  involve
multiphase  turbulent  flow.  For  example,  a  turbo-jet  engine  can  have
particles in the inlet, the combustor, and the exhaust. Particulate matter
from the entering flow could lead to blade damage or accretion in the
high-speed compressor section. To avoid this, a centrifugal separator can
be used to cyclone out the particles, but this is made less efficient by
turbulence. The compressor is followed by a combustor, which includes
spray nozzles to produce fuel drops for combustion, which is made more
efficient by turbulence. The combustion efficiency is improved when the
drops are uniformly distributed in the combustor via turbulence.

Renewable  energy  systems  can  also  be  influenced  by  turbulent

multiphase  flow.  For  example,  solar  panels  and  wind  turbine  blades
must be designed to withstand particle erosion as well as ice accretion.
Both  icing  and  erosion  are  complex  multiphase  flows  which  involve
trajectories influenced by the local aerodynamics and critical aspects of
the impact physics. Multiphase flow can also be important for energy
storage  systems  that  support  renewable  energy.  For  example,  com-
pressed air energy storage can be made highly efficient if the process is
made  nearly  isothermal  by  spraying  small  drop  into  the  air  stream
during compression and expansion. This creates a high surface area for
heat transfer  which  can be enhanced  and  more efficient  by  turbulent
mixing.

In  the  following,  multiphase  turbulence  is  considered  in  terms  of
turbulent diffusion of particles, the bias effects of turbulence on particle
velocity, the effects of particle on turbulence, and finally, the effect of
turbulence  on  particle  collisions.  Computational  methods  for  treating
turbulent dispersed flow are discussed by Balachandar & Eaton [1].

2. Terminology and particle equation of motion

A few essential definitions will be introduced to describe the basic
features of multiphase flow herein. First, a “particle”  is defined as an
unattached freely-moving body immersed in a fluid, which is the “sur-
rounding flow”. Herein, we focus on “dispersed flow”, whereby particle
motion is primarily influenced by that of the surrounding flow, rather
than  by  particle  collisions.  In  contrast,  “dense  flow”  occurs  when

particle collisions dominate particle motion, which is more likely at high
particle concentrations.

For  dispersed  flow,  the  collection  of  all  the  particles  in  the  flow
domain is defined as the “dispersed phase” while the surrounding fluid is
defined as the “continuous phase”. The latter definition assumes that the
surrounding flow can be considered as a continuum. The continuous-
phase  variables  and  properties  will  be  typically  designated  by  the
subscript “f" (e.g., ρf  is the surrounding fluid’s density and μf  is its dy-
namic viscosity), while the dispersed-phase variables and properties will
be  typically  designated  by  the  subscript  “p",  (e.g.,  ρp  is  the  particle
density).

For  a  particle,  we  define  a  relationship  between  its  volume  and

diameter as

particle density is much greater than the fluid density.

Next, we define the velocity of surrounding fluid in the point-force
reference  frame  (u),  as  the  velocity  which  neglects  the  presence  and
motion of the particle. Thus, the flow defined by u is “unhindered” by
the presence of the particle (ignores the local details of the flow path
deflection  around  the  particle  surface).  Note  that  if  there  are  other
particles in the domain, u takes into account their integrated influence
on the flow but not the influence of the particle for which it is being
referenced.

If one interpolates the unhindered surrounding velocity field (u) to
the particle centroid (xp), this is termed the surrounding fluid velocity
“seen” by the particle and is denoted as u@p. This hypothetical velocity
allows  one  to  define  a  relative  particle  velocity  (w)  as  the  difference
between the particle (v) and that of the unhindered surrounding fluid
(u@p), which can be related to the drag force (FD), drag coefficient (CD)
and the Stokes drag correction factor (φ) as

The RHS of latter equation shows that the relationship between these
two drag normalizations, through the particle Reynolds number (Rep).
Based on this Reynolds number, there are two important regimes for a
smooth spherical solid particle: the Stokes’ regime (for which φ = 1) and
Newton’s regime (for which CD is a constant):

Note that non-spherical particle shapes can lead to drag modifications
[2–4]. Using the particle drag and assuming high-density particles in a
gas  (ρp»ρf),  one  may  identify  the  particle  response  time  (τp)  and  the

The  latter  equation  ignores  added  mass,  fluid  stress  and  history
forces which can often be ignored for solid particle or liquid drops in a
gas. This particle response time of Eq. (6a) can be compared to various
flow time scales as discussed in the following section. It should be noted
that the creeping flow limit where φ is a constant, allows this response
time to be independent of time for a fixed particle size, and the case of φ
= 1 for a sphere is often used. In the general case where the drag is non-
linear, the changes in response time due to changes in relative velocity
should  be  considered.  However,  these  changes  may  be  reasonably
neglected if the particle relative velocity only weakly from the relative
velocity (wterm, defined when LHS acceleration of Eq. (6b) is zero).

3. Basic characteristics of turbulence

For use in later discussions with particles, some basic characteristics
of turbulent flows are introduced. For a statistically stationary flow, one
may  decompose  the  instantaneous  velocity  in  terms  of  the  position
vector (X) and time (t) as

u(X, t) = u(X) + u

The magnitude of the randomly directed velocity fluctuations can be
characterized  by turbulent kinetic energy and also used to define the

The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) transport PDE includes the Eulerian
time-derivative,  the  mean  convection of  turbulent  energy,  the  kinetic
energy  diffusive  flux  and  the  production  and  dissipation  of  turbulent
kinetic energy

ε ≡ (cid:0)

 ̇kdiss

9b

As shown in Eq. (9a), the LHS time derivative will be zero for ergodically
stationary flow and the RHS generation term is divided into a production
term  associated  with  flow  instabilities  and  a  dissipation  term,  whose
magnitude is defined as the turbulent energy dissipation, ε (Eq. (9b)).
In  general,  turbulent  flows  can  be  nasty  to  analyze  due  to  spatial
gradients  and  directional  differences,  i.e.,  as  they  Nonhomogeneous
Anisotropic Turbulence (NAsT). A useful and common historical ideal-
ization  is  Homogenous  Isotropic  Stationary  Turbulence  (HIST).  This
flow has no spatial gradients such that the kinetic energy and dissipation
are independent of location

∇k = 0and∇ε = 0for homogeneous turbulence

10

Further, it is isotropic since the magnitude of the velocity fluctuations
are independent of direction and thus are all equal

While stationary turbulence can never be perfectly homogenous, many
flows fortunately have at least some regions that can be considered as
“nearly”  HIST. These regions are generally far from any solid surfaces
and area associated with near uniform mean velocity.

To characterize the average spatial and temporal correlation of tur-
bulent structures, one may define the “velocity correlation coefficient”,
which is denoted as Γ and quantified as time-average of the product of
one component of the velocity fluctuations at a given point and time
with another component of the velocity fluctuations at a different time
(with a time shift τ) and/or at a different location (with a spatial shift
vector χ ). If one considers this coefficient along either a Lagrangian path
or a moving-Eulerian path and integrates over all time shifts, this yields
the Lagrangian or the moving-Eulerian integral time scales, e.g.,

12b

12c

As noted in the last expression, the timescales are also homogeneous and
isotropic  for  HIST.  However,  the  Lagrangian  time  scale  is  generally
smaller than the moving-Eulerian time scale for weak turbulence and
can be approximately quantified [5] as

τΛL / τΛmE ≈ 0.6 for uΛ≪u

13

The difference arises since the Lagrangian fluid path meanders and in-
teracts with other structures. However, the quantitative ratio of 0.6 is
only a rough estimate and the can vary significantly for different types of
flow. For example, ratios ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 have been reported, e.
g., Elghobashi & Truesdell [6]; Squires & Eaton [7]; Loth & Stedl [8];
Coppen et al. 2001 [9], and Wang & Manhart [10].

One may also define integral length scales by decomposing the ve-
locity fluctuations into the streamwise direction and lateral direction as

If one instead considers the lateral velocity fluctuations, the associated

expressed (with a streamwise spatial shift) as

For HIST at low turbulence intensities, Wang & Stock [11] and Synder &
Lumley  [12]  showed  that  the  continuity  effect  (which  stems  from
applying the continuity equation) yields

Λy = Λz = 1/2Λx for uΛ≪u and HIST

17

Thus, the integral length-scales are anisotropic even when the turbulent
velocity fluctuations are isotropic.

The proportionality for the lateral length scale is quantified through

∫∞

k =

E(n) dn

0

22

The  relationship  between  E  and  n/2π  = 1/l  is  conceptually  shown  in
Fig. 1, whereby the largest wavenumbers are limited by the macroscopic
length scale (D) and the smallest scales by the Kolmogorov length scale
(η), beyond which viscous dissipation effectively filters the turbulence.
The wave number associated with the integral length scale (Λ) occurs
between these limits near the peak in the energy distribution.

If the flow Reynolds number is high enough so that the spectrum is
wide,  the  downward  cascade  of  energy  can  give  rise  to  an  “inertial
subrange”  for  which  Λ»l»η  such  that  the  wavelengths  and  the  wave
numbers are related as

E ∼ ε2/3n(cid:0) 5/3 ∼ ε2/3l5/3 for Λ»l »η

23

This  result  yields  a  (cid:0) 5/3  slope  when  considered  on  a  log-log  plot
(Fig. 1).

One  may  also  define  the  directional  specific  turbulent  energy  per
frequency in a given direction as G. For  example, the energy per fre-
quency  for  streamwise  velocity  fluctuations  (in  the  x  direction)  is  Gx
which is defined based on

the “turbulence structure parameter” (cΛ), defined as

24

This parameter typically ranges from 0.5 to 2, such that there is no single
value of the structure parameter for all flows, and instead we can only
expect cΛ~1 for an approximately HIST flow. One may also define the
“dissipation parameter” (cε) and the “dissipation length scale” (Λε) as

For a HIST flow, G is independent of direction (as was the case for E).

time scale as

19b

This simple model provides a reasonable representation of the peak
kinetic energy at frequencies on the order of 1/τΛ as well as the tran-
sition to energy decay at higher frequencies.

As with the structure parameter, the dissipation parameter is of order
unity for nearly HIST flows (cε~1), but the quantitative value depends
on the flow type and Reynolds number.

In turbulent free-shear flows at high Reynolds numbers, the smallest
scales are the “Kolmogorov microscales” (η) and by dimensional analysis
and physical reasoning are proportional to the turbulent dissipation and
kinematic viscosity as

(cid:0)

20

Notably,  turbulent  dissipation  for  this  timescale  is  often  difficult  to
measure as it requires careful measuring the high-frequency dissipation
range of the turbulent spectrum [13]. As an example, the experimental
dissipation was measured using such spectra by Aliseda et al. [14] using
two different techniques that “were found to agree within 10%” for all
locations.

To consider distribution of turbulent energy, l can be defined as a
turbulent  wavelength  which  can  be  related  the  dimensional  “wave
number” (n) as

n ≡ 2π/l

21

Note that a non-dimensional wave number can be defined by using the
Kolmogorov length scale, which is convenient when comparing spectra
from different flows at high wavenumbers. The “specific turbulent en-
ergy” (E) is defined as the kinetic energy per wave number and its in-
tegral over all wave numbers equals the total kinetic energy, i.e.

Fig. 1. Schematic of the turbulence energy spectrum plotted on a log-log scale of
specific turbulent kinetic energy as a function of the inverse of the wavelength
[adapted from 70]. The turbulence is generally produced by instabilities at the
domain scales and become strongest at the integral scales (Λ). The energy then
cascades down into smaller and smaller scales until it is dissipated by viscosity
at the micro-scales (η). For a high enough Reynolds number, a well-developed
inertial subrange (with a (cid:0) 5/3 slope on a log-log plot) will form between the
integral scales and the Taylor scale (λ).

4. Turbulent Stokes numbers

Inertia  determines  a  particle’s  velocity  reaction  to  turbulent  flow
fluctuations  and  the  associated  drag-based  response  time  (τp).  This
inertia influence can be used to define the integral Stokes number (StΛ)
based on the Lagrangian integral time scale (τΛL) and the:

StΛ ≡

τp
τΛL

=

(cid:0)

ρpd2
)
18μf φ

τΛL

26

Note that φ = 1 for spherical particles at low Reynolds numbers per
Eq. (5b). The influence of the integral-scale Stokes number on particle
dynamics can be summarized as

StΛ«1 particle closely follows integral-scale structures

27a

StΛ~1 particle motion partly follows the integral-scale structures            27b

StΛ»1 particle motion is weakly affected by the integral-scale structures  27c

These regimes are illustrated in Fig. 2 based on the eddy and braid
structure of a turbulent mixing layer. It can be seen that larger inertia
particles  tend  to  follow  their  initial  path.  For  intermediate  inertias
(StΛ~1), the particle has a significant response to the eddies but also has
a significant deviation from the fluid path lines.

Similarly, the Kolmogorov Stokes number (Stη) is based on the Kol-

mogorov time scale (τη)

Stη ≡

and establishes the following regimes:

Stη  = 1  for  zero  gravity,  showing  particle  location  (black  dots)  and  vorticity
contours (red is maximum and blue is minimum) indicating particles tend to be
centrifuged  out  of  vortices  into  regions  of  low  vorticity,  from  Ref.  [19]

Stη«1 particle motion closely follows all turbulent structures                  29a

Stη~1 particle motion partly follows the micro-structures                       29b

Stη»1 particle motion is weakly affected by the micro-structures              29c

Note that the response for Eq. (29a) arises since Stη«1 indicates that a
particle will have a small Stokes number relative to all the (larger) times
scales  of  the  turbulence.  When  Stη~1,  particles  tend  to  be  closely
grouped  in  some  regions  and  be  completely  absent  in  other  regions,
known as “preferential concentration”  [17,18]. In particular, particles
tend  to  accumulate  in  thin-banded  regions  with  concentration  thick-
nesses on the order of the Kolmogorov length scale (η) as shown in Fig. 3.
The  figure  also  shows  that  particles  coincide  with  regions  of  low
vorticity,  which  is  qualitatively  consistent  with  centrifuging  out  of
vortex cores as shown in Fig. 2.

Another  useful  viewpoint  of  particle  spread  by  turbulence  is  to
consider the concentration of the particles in a time-averaged sense. In
this case,  the turbulent structures are  no longer individually resolved
and the average particle concentration spreads smoothly by “turbulent
diffusion”.  Fig.  4  highlights  the  differences  between  the  unsteady
structural dispersion of particles (Fig. 4a) and mean turbulent diffusion
of particles (Fig. 4b). While the former uncovers the fluid physics of the

particle motion, the latter is often more important to quantify system-
level performance of a multiphase system. In the following, the mean
spread  (turbulent  diffusion)  of  particles  in  terms  of  the  influence  of
particle inertia and particle terminal velocity is analyzed.

5. Turbulent diffusion of particles

5.1. Particle diffusivity and fluid-tracer limit

To quantify turbulent diffusion for particles, Taylor [21] and Hinze
[15] considered a group of particles originating from a fixed single point
in  space  (Xpo)  but  released  at  different  times  (to).  Owing  to  different
turbulent structures appearing at various times, each particle will follow
a  different  trajectory  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  Cartesian  particle  co-
ordinates can be combined to form the particle position vector while the
particle time shift along the trajectory can be defined relative to the time
since release

A statistically large number of particle trajectories (Np) can be used
to define an ensemble average for the mean position vector of the par-
ticles at a given time shift and the associated deviation from this mean
for a single particle with index i:

If we neglect effects of initial conditions and the surrounding fluid
mean velocity is uniform, then the ensemble-averaged particle velocity
will also be uniform.

If we consider the y-component of the particle positions, the square
of the deviation can be used to define the particle spread (with units of

releases is a cloud of particles that surrounds the mean position defined
by Eq. (31a). Similarly, the instantaneous particle velocity (v) can be
decomposed into ensemble-averaged and fluctuation values and related
to the particle position time derivatives as

Similar expression can be obtained for the spread and the spread rate
in the x and z directions. Note that the square root of the spread (with
units of length) characterizes the mean size of the mean particle cloud
(as shown in Fig. 5 for the x and z directions). Notably, the time deriv-
ative on the RHS of Eq. (33b) is related to the particle velocity fluctu-
ation of Eq. (32). A normalized particle turbulent diffusivity can then be
defined  as  the  particle  diffusivity  compared  to  the  fluid  turbulent
diffusivity, e.g., in the y direction

To understand the separate effects of particle inertia is finite and of
gravity,  it  is  helpful  to  consider  two  relative  velocities  limits.  In
particular, the “weak-drift”  limit is defined by no gravitational effects
nor  initial  relative  velocity  (so  the  average  relative  velocity  is  zero)
while  the “strong-drift”  limit is  defined  by  a  relative velocity (due to
terminal velocity or the initial velocity) that is much greater than the
turbulent strength:

Similar expressions can be written for the particle velocity deviation
and diffusivity in the x and z directions. To consider the correlation on
the RHS of Eq. (35b), it is helpful to define the integral time scale for the
fluid turbulence along the particle path, where this time scale is denoted
τ@p. This time scale is based on the ensemble-averaged correlation of the
fluid velocity fluctuations along the particle path. If we consider a HIST
flow, this correlation is equal to the time-averaged correlation with the
same time and space shift (along the particle path)

The “@p” subscript on the LHS denotes that this correlation is based
on the unhindered fluid velocity interpolated to the particle position.
The integral time scale for the fluid turbulence along the particle path
(τ@p) can then be defined by integrating over all time shifts as

∫∞

38

This is the average time it takes for fluid velocity fluctuations in the y
direction to decay along the particle path, where similar expressions can
be written for the x and z directions.

The  simplest  particle  diffusivity  limit  is  for  a  zero-inertia  particle
(StΛ  = 0). In this case, the trajectory follows the fluid exactly (Xp  = Xf
and  v  = u),  the  particle  turbulent  diffusivity  and  integral  time  scale
revert to that for the fluid turbulent diffusivity, e.g., in the y direction as

Θp,y→Θturb,y

τ@p,y→τΛL,y

39a

39b

One may also define a normalized turbulent diffusivity for the par-

ticle relative to the fluid as

/

Θ∗ ≡ Θp

Θturb for StΛ→0and HIST

40

For HIST, this normalized turbulent diffusivity tends to unity at all
locations, times and directions (since the fluid diffusion is also homo-
geneous and isotropic). As such, the particle cloud will grow as a sphere
and at the same rate as a fluid tracer.

When the particle inertia is finite and gravity is significant, the fluid
and particle diffusivities will be generally different so that Eq. (40) no
longer holds. In particular, gravitational effects can influence particle
diffusivity. These effects can be characterized by the ratio of the terminal
velocity  (wterm)  to  the  strength  of  velocity  fluctuations  (uΛ),  which  is
defined as the “drift parameter”

γ ≡

wterm
uΛ

41

At  a  low  drift  parameter,  gravitational  effects  are  weak,  and  the
particle  motion  is  more  influenced  by  drag  via  the  continuous  phase
turbulence. However, as the drift parameter increases, particles become
more likely to cut through the turbulent structures due to gravitational

42a

42b

These weak-drift and strong-drift limits will be characterized in the
next two sections in terms of Stokes number and drift parameter, and
then a following section will combine these results for the generalized
case of intermediate drift.

5.2. Weak-drift limit and inertial effects

The  simplest  influence  of  particle  inertia  on  its  diffusivity  occurs
when the mean particle path can be approximated with the mean fluid
path (i.e., when the mean relative velocity is negligible in comparison)
in the weak-drift limit. Such a condition occurs when the particle rela-
tive velocity (w) is dominated by the random effects of turbulence rather
by the deterministic effects of gravity or particle initial conditions. Since
the mean particle trajectory and mean fluid path lines coincide, so will
the ensemble-averaged velocities

〈v〉wd ≈ 〈u@p〉for weak (cid:0) drift limit

43

For HIST with high inertia particles, the correlation coefficient for
the fluid velocity fluctuations along the mean particle path of Eq. (37)
will be similar to the moving-Eulerian fluid path as discussed by Reeks
[22], and from Eq. (12b), this extends to the integral time scales

Γ@p(τ) ≈ ΓmE(τ)for weak (cid:0) drift and StΛ→∞

τ@p ≈ τΛ mE

44a

44b

Recalling the result of Eq. (39b), the integral time scale seen by the
path will generally increase from τΛL  to τΛmE  as the Stokes number in-
creases. Wang & Stock [11] developed a semi-empirical a model for this
increase. However, the ratio of τΛL/τΛmE  can vary from 0.03 to 1.0 (as
noted in Section 2) such that a single quantitative relationship can be
difficult to ascertain. One approach is to use the Hinze theory [15] which
ignores this dependence and employs Eq. (39b) for all Stokes numbers.
The  Wang  &  Stock  and  Hinze  approaches  will  be  shown  later  to  be
similar but with some quantitative differences.

To quantify the finite-inertia particle response to this spectrum, one
may  neglect  gravitational  effects  and  the  particle  initial  conditions
(based  on  Eqs.  (43)  and  (44))  and  apply  the  Hinze  small-inertia
assumption (τ@p  = τΛL). In this hypothetical limit, the equation of mo-
tion can be expressed in terms of the instantaneous and fluctuating ve-
locities (relative to an ensemble average as in Eq. (32)) is

If one further assumes linear drag (so that τp  is constant along the
particle path), this second equation can be integrated over all the fluid
frequencies to obtain the spectrum of particle velocity fluctuations. This
particle velocity spectrum can then be integrated to obtain the turbulent
diffusivity of the particles [15] and the primary steps are outlined below.
First,  we  consider  one-dimensional  forms  of  the  fluid  and  particle

velocity fluctuations in the form of Fourier series as

46b

These expressions include four length scales where l1 and l2 depend
on the fluid characteristics while l3  and l4  also depend on the particle
characteristics. The resulting frequency spectrum of the particle velocity
fluctuations is then

Gp(f ) = G(f )

47

In order to obtain the ratio on the RHS, one may substitute the fluid
and particle velocity fluctuations of Eq. (46) into the perturbation par-
ticle equation of motion of Eq. (45b). Carrying out the differentiations
and integrals, then setting all the coefficients of the sine terms for a given
frequency to be equal and doing the same for the cosine terms yields

These length scale relationships can then be substituted into Eq. (47)
to obtain the particle frequency spectrum. This spectrum can then be
substituted into Eq. (46b) to get the particle velocity fluctuations from
which  the  weak-drift  particle  diffusivity  (Θwd)  can  be  obtained  using
Eqs. (34), (36) and (44) with the Hinze assumption (τ@p = τΛL) as

met for large inertia particles (e.g., it is not yet met for StΛ = 10 in Fig. 6).
Moreover,  the  assumption  τ@p  = τΛL  is  not  reasonable  at  high  Stokes
numbers. In particular, Reeks [22] showed that high inertia can lead to
an increased diffusivity

Θ∗

wd > 1forτ≫τp≫τΛmE

53

However, the quantitative degree of increase at high inertia is not
well  understood.  Reeks  [22]  predicted  a  nearly  60%  increase  in
long-time  diffusivity  while  Wang  &  Stock  [11]  predicted  increases  of
more than 80%. However, DNS results of Squires and Eaton [7], Ahmed
& Elghobashi [23], and He et al. [24] demonstrated increases of 25% or
less, while quantitative results from experiments at weak drift are not
readily available.

If we employ the small-inertia weak-drift particle spread rate, one
may obtain the particle spread at a given time by integrating Eq. (49)
yielding the HIST result

Since the integral time scales and velocity fluctuations are isotropic
for HIST, the weak-drift particle turbulent diffusivity is also isotropic, i.

The spread is isotropic in all directions consistent with the isotropy of
Eq.  (50).  Notably,  this  result  neglects  terminal  velocity,  which  is
considered in the following.

Thus, the particles will diffuse uniformly in all directions, i.e., the
positional spread about the mean particle trajectory can be represented
as a spherical particle cloud (Fig. 5) and the diffusivity characterizes the
rate at which the cloud size increases.

Using  the  above  and  Eq.  (34),  we  can  obtain  a  normalized  Hinze
weak-drift  particle  diffusivity  in  terms  of  the  integral-scale  Stokes
number of Eq. (26) as

This dependence on the integral-scale Stokes number (StΛ) and the
ratio of the time along the particle path to the integral time scale (τ/τΛL)
is presented in Fig. 6. For very short times (τ«τΛL), the diffusivity ratio
tends to zero especially for large Stokes numbers, i.e., inertia causes the
particle spread rate to be initially slower than that for the fluid particles
(species). For long times (compared to both the fluid integral-scale and
the particle response time), this plot and Eq. (51) shows the normalized
diffusivity for weak-drift small-inertia particles approaches unity

Θ∗

wd = 1forτ≫τΛL≫τp

52

As such, the long-time turbulent spread rate for particles tends to that
of a fluid species. This result is perhaps non-intuitive and occurs because
the long-time limit allows sufficient time for the particles to respond to
all scales of the turbulence. However, the long-time limit is not easily

5.3. Strong-drift limit and eddy-crossing effects

We  next  consider  the  strong-drift  limit  when  either  the  terminal
velocity (wterm) or initial velocity (wo) is very high compared to turbulent
velocity fluctuations (uΛ) as discussed by Csanady [25]. In this limit, the
turbulence can be considered “frozen”). In this frozen turbulence limit,
the fluid velocity fluctuations are shifted in time by the mean velocity as
shown in Fig. 7. As a result, the dashed blue lines have no change in u’
since this field shifts as frozen, i.e.

Therefore, the correlation between u’ values along the dashed black
line in Fig. 7 is equivalent to that along the dotted black line. In other
words, the change in u’ seen by a strong-drift particle over a shift in time
and space given by v and τ (RHS of Eq. (55b)) is the same as that for a
spatial shift wτ with no shift in time (LHS of Eq. (55b)).

The fluid velocity fluctuations at any point can be decomposed (per
Eq. (14)) into those that are parallel and perpendicular to the mean fluid
velocity as

If one assumes that the relative velocity in the denominator of the
RHS  is  a  constant  and  equal  the  ensemble-averaged  value,  and  one
further assumes that the spatial correlations are independent of direc-
tion (homogeneous turbulence), the remaining portions of the RHS can
be equated with the parallel and perpendicular integral length scales of
Eqs. (15) and (16), i.e.

The  first  two  relationships  can  also  be  qualitatively  inferred  from
Fig. 8 where τsd can be related to the time it takes for a particle to cross a
turbulent structure of size Λ while moving at a speed w. As a result, τsd is
termed the “eddy-crossing”  time. The third relationship indicates that
the  particle-Lagrangian  time  scale  of  the  fluid  turbulence  anisotropic
(depends on the direction of the velocity fluctuations) since these the
streamwise and lateral integral length scales differ by a factor of two
because of continuity effects (Eq. (17)).

If one considers the turbulent energy per frequency (Eq. (25)) along

Fig. 8. Schematic of eddy-crossing effect where Λ  is the integral length-scale
and  w  is  the  relative  velocity  traversing  this  structure.  If  the  turbulence  is

Since τsd is shorter than τΛL due to eddy crossing, a strong-drift par-

If  we  consider  the  change  in  the  integral  time  scale  seen  by  the

These  diffusivity  ratios  are  plotted  in  Fig.  9  for  cΛ  = 1  (a  typical
value). For small drift parameters, the diffusivity ratios approach unity,
consistent with the weak-drift limit (Eq. (52)). As the drift parameter
increases (due to higher particle terminal velocity), there is a decrease in
the longitudinal diffusivity (due to the eddy-crossing effect) and an even
larger reduction in the lateral diffusivity (due to the eddy-crossing effect
and the continuity effect).

The lateral spread can be obtained by substituting τ@p for τΛL in Eq.
(54a) (so as to account for eddy-crossing and continuity effects). For a
flow with mean velocity in the x direction, the lateral spread will be in
the  y  and  z  directions.  In  this  case,  the  lateral  spread  based  on  inte-
grating Eqs. (54a) and (65b) is given as

Thus, the lateral spread rate is approximately half of the longitudinal
spread rate for strong-drift particles in HIST due to a combination of the
eddy-crossing  and  the  integral  length  scale  isotropy.  As  such,  an
ensemble-averaged strong-drift particle cloud at a given time will have a
longer dimension in the streamwise direction than that in the two lateral
directions.

5.4. Diffusivity for intermediate drift

Next, we consider the case of intermediate drift (between the limits
of weak drift and strong drift) where the particle diffusivity will be in
between these limits. This diffusivity will be primarily driven the inte-
gral time scales of the fluid velocity fluctuations. For intermediate drift
in HIST, Csanady [25] developed an approximate relationship for these
time scales along the particle path (τ@p of Eq. (38)) as

This model reverts to the small-inertia Hinze limit for weak drift (Eq.

The “@p” subscript represents the fluid velocity fluctuations seen along

Using these spectra, the HIST particle turbulent diffusivity in the y
direction  and  its  long-time  normalized  value  can  be  obtained  (in  a
manner similar to Eqs. (59)–(63)) as

This prediction is shown in Fig. 10 and compares well with a particle
spread in a nearly HIST experimental flow (grid-generated wake flow in
a wind tunnels) if one employs cΛ  = 1.5. Again, it should be noted that
other  experiments  may  be  better  predicted  with  another  cΛ,  such  no
single coefficient value is expected to robustly predict spread for various
turbulent flows.

6. Turbulence impact on particle velocity fluctuations

6.1. Particle turbulent kinetic energy

As noted in the previous section, the turbulent kinetic energy of fluid
fluctuations seen by particles along their paths in homogeneous turbu-
lence  is  the  same  as  the  TKE  at  a  fixed  point  in  space  regardless  of
particle  properties.  However,  particle  inertia  and  gravitational  drift
significantly influence particle diffusivity. The dependencies also occur
for particle velocity fluctuations as shown in the following.

Similar to the definition of fluid turbulent kinetic energy, the tur-
bulent kinetic energy of the particles can be defined as the sum of the
velocity fluctuations as

To  obtain  these  velocity  fluctuations,  we  can  follow  the  approach
used for Eq. (47) except that the integral time scale of the fluid turbu-
lence seen by the particles will be based on τ@p (instead of on τΛL) per Eq.
(65). As such, the ensemble-averaged y-velocity fluctuations for the fluid
and for the particles can both be expressed in terms of integrations over
all the frequencies

The  particle-path  Stokes  number  is  based  on  the  anisotropic  time
scales of Eq. (65). If the particle-path Stokes numbers for parallel and
perpendicular fluid velocities are respectively defined as Stx and Sty, the
streamwise and lateral components for the particle velocity fluctuations
are given as

As  such,  the  Stokes  numbers  are  equal  for  the  weak-drift  limit.
However,  the  parallel  Stokes  number  will  be  half  the  perpendicular
Stokes number for the strong-drift limit. This anisotropy of the Stokes
numbers for intermediate drifts, will lead to differences in the particle
velocity fluctuations of Eq. (74).

It is also interesting to see how the particle TKE differs from the fluid
TKE. Using Eq. (71) and assuming the lateral components are equal but
different that the streamwise components yields

HIST can be expressed as

For HIST, Eq. (72a) is isotropic (since TKE is invariant of the refer-
ence frame) but Eq. (72b) is anisotropic (due to anisotropic time scales
seen along the particle per Eq. (48)).

The resulting particle velocity fluctuations after integration for HIST
can be expressed [15] in terms of a particle-path Stokes number (St@p),

This  limit  was  obtained  by  Ref.  [18]  and  reasonably  predicts  the
particle  TKE  of  over  a  wide  range  of  Stokes  numbers  as  shown  in
Fig. 11a, and is reasonable for non-linear drag [26,27]. However, the
Hinze theory tends to underestimate kp at high Stokes number, which is
due  to an  underestimation  of τ@p  in  this limit,  i.e.,  it  should actually
increase to τΛmE per Eq. (44b).

It is interesting that the above yields two seemingly contradictory
results  for  increasing  particle  inertia:  particle  velocity  fluctuations
reduce (Eq. (78)) but the long-time diffusion is unchanged (Eq. (52)). To
understand this, recall that the turbulent diffusion is a product of the
integral time scale and the velocity fluctuations of a quantity (e.g., Eq.
(62)). Therefore, the reduction in the particle kinetic energy with Stokes
number must be accompanied by an increase in the integral time scale of
the particle velocity fluctuations. This is attributed to increased particle
inertia  which  filter  out  smaller  frequencies  from  the  fluid  turbulence
leading to longer correlation times for the particle velocity.

To  consider  more  general  drift  conditions  with  Eq.  (74),  one  may
apply the terminal velocity assumptions of Eq. (75). The resulting ratio
of the particle perpendicular to streamwise velocity fluctuations and the

As shown in Fig. 11b, the particle TKE ratio based on the Wang &
Stock  semi-empirical  model yields  reasonable agreement  with  experi-
ments. However, there is significant experimental variations relative to
the theories, which can be related to the differences in cΛ  and τΛL/τΛmE,
which can vary from flow to flow. In addition, non-linear drag bias and
preferential bias can impact the particle kinetic energy [30]. These two
turbulent biases rely on a model for the relative velocity fluctuations,
which is discussed next.

6.2. Particle relative velocity fluctuations

The  relative  velocity  dynamics  of  particles  are  important  as  they
control many turbulent interphase coupling aspects, e.g., momentum,
heat  and  mass  transfer  to  the  particle  as  well  as  breakup  for  drops.
Fortunately,  the  above  analysis  can  be  extended  to  determine  these
relative fluctuations. To start, the relative velocity of a single particle in
the x direction is represented as a Fourier integral per Eq. (72) as

expressed as

Using Eqs. (46), (47) and (72), the ensemble-average of the relative

obtained as

The  result  of  Eq.  (79a)  indicates  that  parallel  and  perpendicular
particle  velocity  fluctuations  are  equal  for  γ  = 0,  but  finite  drift  will
cause the parallel (vertical) velocities to be less than the perpendicular
(horizontal) velocities. The result of Eq. (79b) indicates that particle TKE
tends to the fluid TKE as Stokes numbers and drift parameter tend to
zero, but otherwise particle TKE will be reduced as Stokes number and/
or drift parameter increase. Both these trends have been confirmed with
experiments and simulations [31,30]. It should be noted that the above
assumes  particle  relative  velocity  is  driven  by  homogenous  isotropic
turbulence, and thus will not be appropriate if the turbulence is aniso-
tropic or non-homogenous, or if the particle relative velocity is dictated
by wall reflections [32].

To  simplify  Eq.  (79b)  for  HIST  flow,  it  is  helpful  to  consider  the

strong-drift limits as

as

For St→0, the particles have negligible inertia so that their relative
velocities are negligible compared to the fluid velocity fluctuations. For
St→∞, the particles will not respond to the turbulence so their relative

velocities approach that of the fluid velocity fluctuations. To illustrate
the latter limit, consider a particle released in a flow with no mean ve-
locity with such high inertia particle that it remains nearly stationary (v
~ 0). In this case, the relative velocity fluctuations are nearly equal to
the surrounding fluid fluctuations. The result of Eq. (87) indicates that
intermediate  Stokes  numbers  will  have  relative  velocity  fluctuations
between these two limits. These theoretical trends are shown in Fig. 12
and are generally consistent with available data for particles, whereby
relative velocity fluctuations increase as the inertia gets larger.

To obtain the strength of the relative particle velocity fluctuations,
the sum in all three directions can be written in vector form for HIST as

4)  diffusiophoresis  (Δvα)  which  biases  particle  velocity  toward  low

concentrations

5)  turbophoresis (Δvk) which biases particle velocity to low TKE regions

The  non-linear  drag  bias  and  turbophoresis  impact  the  ensemble-
averaged  relative  velocity  and  while  the  rest  primarily  impact  the
ensemble-averaged  fluid  velocity,  and  if  all  biases  are  linearly  com-
bined, the ensemble-averaged particle velocity can be approximated as

To evaluate these biases with experiments and simulations, a stirred
box flow condition is often employed where the mean flow is zero, but
turbulence is finite. In that case, the settling velocity equals the terminal
velocity plus any biases,

vsettle = wterm + ΔwRe + Δvpref + Δvclus + Δvα + Δvkfor u = 0

93

This effects of the first three biases for this condition are shown in
Fig. 13, where the biases grow stronger as the turbulence level increases
(as the drift parameter decreases). This figure also shows that the biases
can act in opposite directions, to either increase or decrease the particle
relative  velocity.  The  following  sections  discuss  the  reasons  for  these
trends  as  well  theory  and  models  as  compared  to  experimental  and
numerical results for these different biases.

This  result  can  be  used  to  estimate  turbulent  biases,  as  discussed

below.

7. Turbulent biases on mean particle velocity

The  particle  settling  velocity  can  be  defined  as  the  ensemble-
averaged  particle  velocity,  which  can  be  decomposed  into  ensemble
averages of the relative velocity and the fluid velocity seen by the par-
ticles as

vsettle ≡ 〈v〉 = 〈w〉 + 〈u@p〉

90

If there are no turbulent biases, the ensemble-averaged relative ve-

locity will be

〈v〉 = wterm + u@pif no turbulent biases

91

This  will  be  reasonable  in  conditions  of  linear  drag,  one-way
coupling, homogenous particle  concentration  and homogenous turbu-
lence. However, there are at least five turbulent bias mechanisms that
can modify the ensemble-averaged particle velocity including:

1) non-linear  drag  bias  (ΔwRe)  which  decreases  the  mean  relative  ve-

locity at high Rep

2)  preferential bias (Δvpref) which augments the particle velocity in the

direction of gravity

3)  clustering bias (Δvclus) which increases the mean relative velocity at

high concentration

7.1. Non-linear drag bias

For  a  particle  with  non-linear  drag,  the  mean  particle  settling  ve-
locity can be reduced due to turbulence via the non-linear drag bias. To
demonstrate  this,  consider  many  particles  averaged  over  long  times
settling in a HIST flow with no mean fluid velocity so the gravitational
forces balance out the ensemble-averaged drag for high-density particles
as

Fg = ∀pρpg = 〈FD〉for ρp»ρf

using Eq. (3b) while the LHS can be expressed with the terminal velocity,

Thus, the settling velocity (LHS) for a particle with Newton-based

turbulence fluctuations. This reduction is the “non-linear drag bias” and

considers first-order terms, this bias can be expressed as

experimental turbulence and the neglect of the history forces and the
container boundaries for Eq. (100). However, some differences can also
be attributed to preferential concentration bias, as discussed below.

7.2. Preferential bias and clustering

As  shown  in  Figs.  2  and  3,  small  particles  tend  to  concentrate  in
certain regions of the flow yielding non-uniform particle concentration.
This tendency is defined as preferential concentration and is especially
strong for Kolmogorov Stokes numbers near unity (Stη~1). An important
consequence of this phenomena is that the average fluid velocity seen by
the  particles  in  these  concentrated  regions  can  be  different  than  that
averaged over all regions. If the mean particle concentration is small and
uniform, the velocity difference is

Thus, particles with Newton-based drag will fall slower in turbulence
than they would in steady flow conditions.

To generalize this bias for intermediate particle Reynolds numbers,
an  implicit  model  was  developed  by  Mei  [36].  A  similar  alternative
explicit model employing Eqs. (68) and (74) with cΛ≈1 [37] is given as

This expression yields no bias for the linear-drag regime (Yterm = 1)
and yields the Newton-based drag bias of Eq. (99) for Yterm = 2, where
the square root term on the RHS can be expressed in term of the draft
parameter using Eq. (75). As shown in Fig. 14, this explicit model pre-
dicts the trends of settling velocity reduction for experiments and sim-
ulations of particles in oscillating fluids and in turbulent flows. These
experiments  include  drops  in  a  container  with  turbulence  forced  by
loudspeakers  [30],  particles  falling  in  vertically  oscillating  water  col-
umn [38], and particles in a turbulent Couette-Taylor water flow [39]
and particles in active-grid-generated turbulence in a wind tunnel [40].
However, there are large variations especially for high turbulence levels.
Some  of  these  differences  can  be  related  to  the  anisotropy  of  the

The LHS is termed “preferential bias”  and can change the particle

settling velocity independently of the “non-linear drag bias”.

Preferential bias generally arises because particle positions are more
likely to “see” downward fluid velocity fluctuations. The reason for this
is shown schematically in Fig. 15a where particles are centrifuged to the
outside  of  eddies  (Fig.  2b)  which  causes  them  to  be  preferentially
located in downdrafts. Thus, the fluid velocity along the particle path is
biased downward, in the direction of gravity. This “preferential bias”
therefore increases the particle settling velocity as compared to the case
where there is no turbulence.

To model effects of preferential bias in a dilute distribution of par-
ticles,  consider  HIST  flow  with  a  uniform  mean  velocity  and  linear
particle  drag  (so  non-linear  drag  bias  can  be  neglected).  To  obtain  a
relationship between the velocities of Eq. (101), we define the Eulerian
ensemble average for an arbitrary quantity q based on the average value
seen by all particles that pass through a location X (at different times) as

〈q(X)〉 ≡

∑Npm

k=1q(X)

ensemble average for given location

102

As  such,  this  ensemble-average  reflects  a  particle  concentration
weighting of a quantity. If one assumes that the particles all have the
same  volume,  this  can  be  expressed  as  a  volumetric  concentration
weighting as

concentrations  are  correlated  with  fluid  velocity  fluctuations  in  the
gravity direction. Per Fig. 15, the fluid velocity along the particle path is
biased in the direction of gravity so

Δvpref ⋅g > 0

107

In the following, results (from theory, models, experiments and nu-
merical simulations) for this bias are first considered first for one-way
coupling  (α→0)  and  then  for  clustering  conditions  where  both  two-
way and three-way coupling effects become important.

For sparse conditions where one-way coupling is in effect, the pref-
erential  bias  effect  was  treated  theoretically  [42]  for  particles  with
linear drag and small Kolmogorov-scale Stokes number (defined in Eq.
(28)) in a HIST flow with weak turbulence relative to terminal velocity.
For these conditions, the preferential concentration bias was found to be
a function of a preferential turbulent length scale (lpref) as

A  comparison  with  settling  velocity  from  experiments  and  DNS  is
shown  in  Fig.  16a,  where  this  small-particle  theoretical  bias  qualita-
tively explains the settling velocity increase as Stη initially grows, but it
does not explain the general decrease for Stη>1 nor does it explain the
influence of the drift parameter. For variations in the drift parameter
with a fixed Stη, Fig. 16b also shows a settling velocity peak, this time at
around γ = 0.5. As such, both Stη and γ are important to preferential bias
(whereas the small-particle theory only considers the effect of Stη). Wang
& Maxey [44] noted that these peaks occur because particles with low
Stη  and γ  tend to closely follow the fluid resulting in reduced opportu-
nities for preferential concentration, while particles with high Stη and γ
have  increased  eddy-crossing  relative  to  the  microscales,  which  also
reduces this effect.

The predicted combined effects of Stokes number and drift param-
eter are shown in Fig. 17, and can be used to develop an empirical model

Comparisons  of  this  model  with  experiments  and  DNS  shown  in
Fig. 16a indicate qualitative agreement in capturing the peaks, but the
experimental results tend to have larger settling velocities, particularly
for Stη<1. Good et al. [30] suggested that the increased experimental
bias may be due to turbulent flow gradients and flow complexity around
the particle that modifies their drag forces. In addition, clustering bias
(to  be discussed  later) may  have  a  significant  role  since  this tends  to
augment the preferential bias.

The  experiments  in  Fig.  16b  also  show  experimental  bias  values
greater than that predicted by the linear drag DNS results (solid lines,
which match Eq. (111)), especially for γ  < 0.5. However, this trend is
reversed for Stη = 2. This can be partly explained by the presence of non-
linear drag bias as indicated by the non-linear drag DNS results (dashed
lines). These counteracting effects are also shown in Fig. 13, where the
non-linear  drag  bias  reduces  fall  velocity  while  the  preferential  bias
increases fall velocity. The competing trends for these two effects can be

combined based on Eq. (93) as

vsettle = wterm + ΔwRe + Δwpref for u = 0

112

However, this combination with Eq. (100) and Eq. (111) only gives
qualitive  predictions  when  compared  to  experiments.  Moreover,  ex-
periments by Rosa et al. [47] indicated that preferential bias can vary for
Reλ<100, and this influence of the Taylor length was studies in more
detail  by  Mora  et  al.  [48].  Because  of  these  complications,  a  robust
theory or model to robustly predict preferential bias is still needed.

If  the  particle  concentration  in  a  region  becomes  significant,  the
preferential bias becomes even more complicated since both two-way
and  three-way  coupling  effects  can  occur.  In  particular,  the  group  of
particles induces a local downward velocity of the local fluid (two-way
coupling), so the local particles fall faster as well. In addition, the par-
ticles are closer to each other and therefore can have reduced relative
drag  via  drafting  effects  (three-way  coupling).  This  combination  can
increase the average relative fall velocity beyond that of the terminal
velocity. The fluid physics for this bias are discussed by Aliseda et al.
[14] who note that the effect is strengthened with increases in the local
concentration and the cluster diameter.

As shown in Fig. 18a, particles with mass loadings as small as 1%
(cid:0) 5) can have much higher fall velocities
(volume fractions as low as 10
than predicted by  the preferential  bias model of  Eq. (110).  These  ex-
periments  were  conducted  with  droplets  released  in  grid-generated
turbulence  in  a  wind  tunnel  [14].  While  more  work  is  needed  to
develop  a  theory  or  model  to  robustly  predict  cluster  bias,  DNS  with
two-way  coupling  has  been  found  to  reasonably  represent  the  trends
associated with increased mass loading [49] as shown in Fig. 18b giving
direction to future research.

7.3. Diffusiophoresis and turbophoresis

There are also two gradient-based turbulent drift mechanisms that
can  lead  to  a  bias  in  particle  velocity:  “diffusiophoresis”  caused  by  a
mean gradient in particle concentration and “turbophoresis” caused by a
mean gradient in turbulent kinetic energy. Both mechanisms cause a net
drift of particles in the direction opposite to the gradient. As such, these
biases are not related to gravitational effects. Rather, diffusiophoresis
and  turbophoresis  effects  are  related  to  the  turbulent  diffusion  of
particles.

A particle concentration gradient in HIST will, over time, tend to be
equilibrated, i.e., this gradient will tend to be diffused over time due to
turbulent  mixing.  The  net  particle  transport  towards  regions  of  low
particle is termed diffusiophoresis. This is illustrated in Fig. 19a for a
stirred box flow. The concentration gradient (more particles on the left
than on the right) coupled with particle velocity fluctuations caused by
turbulence will yield a net particle flux to the right (since there are more
trajectory opportunities for this to occur).

To model diffusiophoresis, consider an HIST flow with linear drag
(ΔwRe = 0) with no preferential concentration (Δvpref = 0) but a gradient
in  particle  concentration.  In  this  case,  the  ensemble  average  of  the
particle velocity can be expanded to show dependency on a turbulent
correlation

〈v〉 = αv / α = (α + α′ )(v + v′ ) / α = v + α′ v′ / α

Fig.  19. Illustration  of  particle  concentration  flux  in  a  stirred  box  flow  (tur-
bulence with no mean fluid velocity) where a rightward drift will be caused: a)
a  gradient  in  particle  concentration  (diffusiophoresis)  and  b)  a  gradient  in
turbulence intensity (turbophoresis). In both case, black particles are likely to
move  across  the  dashed  flux  boundary  than  grey  particles,  which  leads  to  a
right-ward mean flow of particles; adapted from Ref. [16] with permission.

The particle TKE can be related to the surrounding fluid TKE by Eq. (77).
Further details on this bias are discussed by Elghobashi &  Abou-Arab
[50].

If we now consider a uniform particle concentration but a gradient in
the  fluid  TKE,  then  turbophoresis  can  be  important.  As  shown  in
Fig. 19b, if there is higher turbulence on the left-hand side, particles on
this side will have more random motion and are more likely to be flung
to the right-hand side (as compared to particles in the low turbulence
region  being  flung  to  the  left-hand  side).  As  such,  non-homogenous
turbulence  will  drive  particles  from  high  turbulence  regions  into  low
turbulence regions via turbophoresis.

A simple version of the  turbophoretic velocity can be modeled by

taking a time average of the particle equation of motion

For small response times (StΛ«1) for a flow with steady and uniform
mean flow, the LHS mean particle acceleration at a fixed location can be
approximated by the mean acceleration of the continuous phase along
the fluid path, which can then be decomposed into Eulerian time de-
rivative (which is zero for steady mean flow) and a spatial gradient term
(which is only non-zero for the velocity fluctuations for uniform mean
flow)

If one further assumes that the turbulence is isotropic, the RHS can be
written as 2/3 of the TKE gradient. This result can be combined with Eq.
(116) to yield a model for the turbophoretic velocity bias, which can be
generalized  for  larger  Stokes  numbers  by  using  the  particle  kinetic
energy

fluctuations  by  employing  the  directional  velocity  fluctuations  of  Eq.
(82) for directional turbophoresis.

8. Two-way turbulence coupling by particles

If  the  flow  is  turbulent,  two-way  coupling  associated  with  the
continuous-phase turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is often referred to as
turbulence “modulation”. The changes can be referenced to the changes
in  the  TKE  for  single-phase  flow  via  the  production  and  destruction
terms.  When  particles  are  introduced,  there  are  now  two  sets  of  pro-
duction and destruction terms as shown in Fig. 20: those associated the
continuous-phase fluid interactions and those associated with the par-
ticle interactions. For example, TKE production can be associated with
continuous-phase flow gradients (which can change if particles impact
the mean velocity field) but also by the particle wakes (especially for
large  particles).  In  addition,  viscous  dissipation  occurs  at  the  Kolmo-
gorov  scales  via ε  (which  can change  if  particle  impact  the  turbulent
spectrum, as will be discussed below) but also on the particle surfaces
(especially for small particles). The overall change in TKE generation
with the four mechanisms identified in Fig. 20 can be formalized as
 ̇k =  ̇kprod,f +  ̇kprod,p +  ̇kdiss,f +  ̇kdiss,p =  ̇kprod,f +  ̇kprod,p (cid:0) ε (cid:0) εp

119

The  two  production  terms  reflect  energy  gains,  whereas  the  two
dissipation terms reflect TKE losses (ε and εp are defined as positive for
losses).  For  HIST,  the  net  changes  will  be  balanced  whereas  no  such
balance may occur for NAsT flows.

(enhancement  or  reduction)  in  Fig.  20  can  be  conceptualized  by
considering the hypothetical example of flow past stationary particles
(fixed in space). If the incoming flow has high velocity gradients, the
presence of the small hypothetically-fixed particles can serve to reduce
those gradients by increasing dissipation thereby reducing TKE. In fact,
this is the principle of flow conditioning screens used to reduce turbu-
lence  levels  and  velocity  gradients  in  wind  tunnels.  However,  if  the
incoming flow has low turbulence, large stationary particles will pro-
duce turbulent wakes which will increase the downstream turbulence.
As  another  hypothetical  example,  the  addition  of  small  neutrally-
buoyant particles  in a turbulent bath can increase viscous dissipation
at  the  particle  scales  (εp).  Unfortunately,  the  actual  production  and
dissipation mechanisms are much more complicated because the parti-
cles move and react to the turbulence. In addition, most flows have re-
gions  of  high  velocity  gradients,  anisotropy  and  TKE  production  that
convect and/or diffuses into other regions where the mean velocity is
more uniform, and the dissipation is higher. Therefore, all four terms on
the RHS of Eq. (119) can change due to particles. All this can make it
difficult to assess the effects of the particles on the turbulence. As such, it
is often difficult to predict whether particles will qualitatively increase
or decrease a flow’s TKE, let alone predict the magnitude of the change
[52]. For example, gas turbulence in a vertical pipe flow of air was found
to  be modified  by the  addition of  particle of  different sizes and  mass
loadings [53]. For small particles, the turbulence was reduced due to
work  by the fluid on the particle  motion. For large particles, the tur-
bulence was enhanced due to particle wakes. In both cases, the changes
in turbulent kinetic energy (via production by large particles or dissi-
pation by small particles) was intensified as the particle mass loading
increases.

To understand the physics of these changes, it is helpful to consider
the spectra of the turbulent kinetic energy. An example of the influence
of  particle  on  the  measured  streamwise  specific  energy  spectrum  is
shown in Fig. 21. The single-phase flow spectrum is fully-developed with
a nearly (cid:0) 5/3 slope in the inertial subrange. However, the presence of
particles yields two major changes: a reduction at the low frequencies
(attributed to particle dissipation) and an increase at high frequencies
(attributed to the passage of particle wakes). This combination of energy
decreasing at low frequencies (where the particles are small relative to
the integral scales) and increasing at high frequencies (where the par-
ticles  approach the size of  the turbulent scales) has been  observed in
several other turbulent flows [31,53] Thus, turbulence modulation does
not manifest in a simple across-the-board increase or decrease in TKE
but  instead  the  turbulent  spectrum  changes  locally  depending  on  the
relative particle scales.

Fig.  21. Specific  kinetic  energy  for  streamwise  velocity  fluctuations  in  the
presence of copper particles (70 μm in diameter) at M = 0.2 compared to that
for  the  unladen  flow  (Fx,o)  for  different  frequencies  in  a  turbulent  boundary
layer [54,16].

In the following, theoretical treatments of turbulence modulation are

considered, followed by experimental trends and models.

8.1. Theoretical fomulation of modulation

While a unified robust theoretical treatment of turbulence modula-
tion has proved elusive, some basic mechanisms can be analyzed and we
first consider turbulent dissipation, followed by turbulence production.
If the particles have no significant relative velocity with the fluid,
then  the  change  in  dissipation  is  due  to  the  mixed  fluid  viscosity  via
particle  volume  fraction  (Eq.  5.8a).  However,  this  effect  is  weak  for
high-density particles since the volume fraction is generally very small
for such flows (for a given mass fraction). If the particles instead have
significant relative velocity, then the dissipation near the particle sur-
faces will be enhanced [55]. To describe this turbulent dissipation by
particle relative velocity (εp), one may employ an energy/work principle
whereby  the viscous losses at  particle  surfaces  equal the  rate  of fluid
work applied by the moving particles. This work can be based on the
product  of  the  interphase  force  and  the fluid  velocity.  Since the  drag
force is generally the primary interphase fluid dynamic force and can be
related to the particle response time, the work rate per particle is

120

If one assumes that τp is constant based on a liner drag law as is often
reasonable  for  small  particles  (which  tend  to  drive  dissipation),  the
ensemble average of the work rate by the particles per unit mass of fluid
becomes

This expression includes the work done by the mean and fluctuating
particle  motions  on  the  mean  and  fluctuation  fluid  velocity.  If  we
consider  only  the  fluctuations,  the  resulting  particle-induced  kinetic
energy dissipation can be expressed in terms of a velocity correlation as

netic energy dissipation

124

This  result  was  obtained  by  Mando  et  al.  [56]  where  the  RHS
expansion is based on Eq. (82). Note that the RHS term in parentheses is
generally positive since particle velocity fluctuations are less than fluid
velocity  fluctuations  (Fig.  11).  Therefore,  this  is  a  mechanism  for
increased dissipation, which can translate into reduced TKE for small
particles.  Notably,  the  above  expression  for  εp  can  be  generalized  to
include correlations of particle concentration fluctuations [57], which
can be important if preferential concentration is significant.

To estimate the overall impact of particles on dissipation, one may
compare this enhanced dissipation at the particle surfaces (εp) with the
turbulent dissipation at the Kolmogorov scales for an unladen HIST flow

125

The RHS includes cε,o as the unladen dissipation parameter from Eq.
(19a) as well as the integral Stokes number and drift parameter based on
the unladen turbulence (StΛ,ο  and γo). The result indicates that smaller
Stokes numbers and larger mass loadings will yield larger dissipation,
and both trends are qualitatively consistent with more TKE damping for
small particles. However, careful experimental measurements in a HIST
flow [55] have shown that overall turbulent dissipation actually reduces
very little for such conditions. This suggests that increases in εp  as M
increases are counteracted with decreases in ε, i.e., the turbulent spec-
trum  is  asymmetrically  modified  (consistent  with  Fig.  21).  As  such,
changes in overall dissipation rates are often weak and are not the pri-
mary factor for TKE attenuation [31,55]. Instead, the changes in TKE
can be related to changes in the overall spectrum shape via the size of the
turbulent integral scales. In particular, the ratio of the fluid TKE with
particles (k) and compared to that for no particles (ko) can be related the
ratio of the laden and unladen dissipation rates and dissipation length
scales per Eq. (19b) as

126

Thus,  weak  changes  in  the  dissipation  indicate  that  significant
changes in the kinetic energy must be related to changes in the turbulent
length  scales.  This  hypothesis  is  consistent  with  measurements  of

reduced the integral length scales as the TKE reduced [55]. Similarly,
larger particles were found to increase the turbulent length scale and
were associated with increased TKE [58].

Turning now to turbulence production via in Eq. (119), it is helpful to
consider the mechanical work added to the fluid based on the interphase
force and relative velocity of a particle. If the drag force dominates the
interphase fluid force, the work may be estimated as

FD ⋅ w =

127

Some  of  this  impact  can  adjust  the  mean  velocity  of  the  fluid  via
momentum, which will therefore change the shear-induced turbulence
production.

This work can be used to change the mean momentum of the fluid.
These changes can, in turn, change the mean velocity gradients which
will therefore change the shear-induced turbulence production (kprod,f).
However, some of work of Eq. (127) can be translated into turbulence
addition if there is unsteadiness in the particle wake (which especially
occurs for larger particles at higher Reynolds numbers). If we define this
fraction of this work converted to wake unsteadiness as cprod, the asso-
ciated turbulence production (obtained via the same approach used to
obtain Eq. (122)) becomes

 ̇kprop,p = cprodM〈

w⋅w
〉
τp

128

The RHS indicates that increasing particle mass loading will increase
turbulence  production.  The  RHS  correlation  can  be  simplified  by
assuming linear drag (so τp  is constant) and approximating w with the
steady  terminal  velocity  so  that  only  cprod  (the  fraction  of  energy
resulting in wake unsteadiness) is needed to apply Eq. (128).

If we consider the solid sphere particles in a uniform steady flow, the
wakes are steady for Rep < 130 such that one may expect cprod = 0 for
these conditions. Such a hypothesis is consistent with experiments [59]
and resolved-surface simulations [60] which indicated that significant
turbulence is only induced for Rep > 210, for which there is strong wake
unsteadiness. However, Hoque et al. [58] observed turbulence increases
in  grid-generated  turbulence  for  Rep  values  ranging  from  10  to  100.
Similarly, Parthasarathy and Faeth [61] observed particle-induced tur-
bulence with a fully-developed cascade (including a (cid:0) 5/3 slope for the
inertial  sub-range)  for  Rep  as  low  as  38.  This  suggests  that  the  sur-
rounding turbulence can be enhanced even when the particle wakes are
steady. As such, the mechanism of turbulence augmentation by unsteady
particle wakes is not well understood, and this has hindered a theoretical
framework.

8.2. Turbulence modulation tends and models

To  characterize  the  influence of  particle  size  and  turbulent  length
scale  on  turbulence  modulation,  Crowe  [62]  broadly  reviewed  pipe
flows with particles in air and found that the ratio of particle diameter to
an integral length  scale  generally dictates  whether TKE is reduced or
augmented. However, the pipe flow has large gradients in the mean flow
and kinetic energy, as well as significant turbulence anisotropy. If one
considers  flows  that  are  nearly  HIST,  a  more  fundamental  picture  of
modulation can emerge. Modulation in nearly HIST flows can be rep-
resented by changes in kinetic energy (k/ko) as a function of the particle
diameter relative to the local dissipation length scale (d/Λε, defined with
Eq. (19b)) as well as mass loading (defined in Eq. (123)). Experiments
with  wind  tunnel  grid-generated  turbulence  [31],  a  stirred  container
using synthetic jet actuators [55,63], a turbulent jet [56], and a stirred
container  using  oscillating  grids  [58]  can  all  be  characterized  by  the
following criteria:

The  experiments  also  generally  showed  that  the  attenuation  and
augmentation  effects  are  both  greater  with  larger  mass  loadings,
consistent with Eqs. (122) and (128).

A simple empirical model which employs the mass loading effect of
Eq.  (128),  the  length-scale  relationship  of  Eq.  (126),  and  follows  the
trends of Eq. (129) can be given as

One  may  also  investigate  this  model  for  pipe  and  channel  flows,
keeping  in  mind  their  anisotropic  and  non-homogeneous  turbulence.
Given  these complexities,  the  TKE and  turbulent length scale  may  be
best can be considered in an average-sense by using area-averaged TKE
or TKE at the pipe half-radius, e.g., the Λε≈0.2R [62]. This helps avoid
focusing on regions dominated by dissipation (at the pipe centerline) or
by TKE production (at the pipe wall). Using this approach, available data
for  vertical  pipe  and  channel  air  flows  where  the  turbulence  was
modulated by particles [17,53,64,65] are shown in Fig. 22. Again, all the
experimental  data  for  the  pipe  flows  are  well  characterized  by  the
criteria of Eq. (129). The model of Eq. (130) (depicted by solid lines in
Fig. 22a) is again shown to be qualitatively consistent in terms of effect
of  length-scale  ratio  and  mass  loading.  In  addition,  a  more  complex
empirical  model  of  Crowe  [62]  for  pipe  flow  centerline  turbulence
changes (which is based on Eq. (119) with several empirical parameters)
is  shown  in Fig. 22b  by  the  dashed  lines. The  Crowe  model does  not
appear to be as robust as Eq. (130) for modulation at the half-radius,
despite additional physics built into this model.

Example modulations for small and large particles are considered as
a  function  of  mass  loading  in  Fig.  23  for  small  and  large  particles,

Kulick et al. [17] compared to the turbulence modulation prediction based on:
a) the length-scale modulation model, and b) the Crowe pipe flow modulation
model for centerline changes.

et al. [17], and Varaksin et al. [33] along with modulation models for: a) small
particles (5d/Λε<1) and b) large particles (5d/Λε>1).

comparing  measurements  and  models.  This  includes  previously
mentioned pipe and channel air flow experiments [17,53,64,65] as well
as  jet  flow  modulation  [56]  and  an  additional  pipe  flow  experiment
[33].  These  results  and  Eq.  (130)  can  be  used  to  set  an  approximate
criterion for turbulence modulation as

M ̃>0.05 significant turbulence modulation

131

However,  both the  Crowe  and length-scale  modulation models fail  to
capture the extent of turbulence attenuation seen in several of the ex-
periments as also shown in Figs. 22 and 23, indicating that such models
should only be used as qualitative guides.

9. Three-way and four-way turbulence coupling

In  the  following,  three-way  coupling  and  four-way  coupling  are
considered in the presence of turbulence. In particular, three-way tur-
bulence  coupling  occurs  due  to  turbulent  fluid  dynamic  interactions
between  particles  (without  direct  particle  contact)  while  four-way
coupling  considers  collisions  between  particles  due  to  turbulence
(direct particle contact).

For three-way coupling, one particle’s local flow field impacts that of
another  particle.  In  steady  flows,  this  is  most  often  manifested  via
drafting and the same principle can occur in turbulence. As such, a wake
interaction criterion can be applied based on the mean volume fraction
as

α ̃>0.01 for significant mean three (cid:0) way coupling

α ̃> 0.1 for dense flow via three (cid:0) way coupling

131a

131b

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience97(2023)10109420

E. Loth

However, drafting effects can be reduced by turbulence since it can
increase the mixing and diffusion of a particle’s wake before this wake
intersects  with  another  particle  [60]  before  this  wake  intersects  with
another  particle.  Furthermore,  turbulence  can  also  cause  regions  of
increased particle concentration via clustering which can reduce local
gaps between particles and enhance localized drafting effects. Clustering
can be particularly pronounced via preferential concentration for small
particles as shown in Fig. 3. This clustering can occur for mass loadings
as low as 1% as shown in Fig. 18 and for volume fractions. As such, a
three-way coupling clustering criterion for turbulence can be proposed
as

M ̃>0.01 for significant three (cid:0) way coupling at Stη ∼ 1

132

This is much more restrictive than the three-way coupling criteria of

Eq. (130).

Particle collisions can also be significantly enhanced by the presence
of turbulence since they induced increased particle velocity fluctuations
and can be characterized by the collision frequency per particle (fcoll)
and the collision Stokes number, given as

Stcoll ≡ τpfcoll

133

For turbulent flow, there are two important limits for fcoll: 1) “kinetic-
based”  limit for large-inertia particles due to integral-scale turbulence
and 2) “diffusion-based”  limit for small-inertia particles due to micro-
scale  turbulence.  These  two  limits  are  considered  below  for  mono-
disperse particle in isotropic turbulence followed by an approximation
for intermediate-inertia particles.

For  kinetic-based  collisions,  particle  trajectories  are  assumed  to
intersect based on random fluctuations of the particles in turbulent flow.
This occurs when the particles emanate from different eddies and have
significant inertias (e.g., StΛ>1). To analyze this condition, Abrahamson
[66] assumed the two particle trajectories are uncorrelated (since they
are associated with different turbulent structures) and the particle ve-
locity fluctuations have a Gaussian distribution. If the particle have a
constant size (diameter), the kinetic-based collision frequency per par-
ticle (fcoll,k) as obtained by Sommerfeld [26] is expressed as

√

fcoll,k = 4

π

′

rmsfor kinetic (cid:0) based collisions

134

As expected, this frequency scales with particle number density. For
particles with weak eddy-crossing effects (γ«1), these particle velocity
fluctuations are isotropic and are related to the fluid TKE and particle
Stokes number. The fluid TKE can then be related to the integral time
and length scales using Eqs. (7) and (18) to yield a kinetic-based fre-
quency and collisional Stokes number (using Eq. (133)) as

This Stokes number quantifies the importance of collisions relative to
particle  drag  for  the  particle  trajectories,  where  Stcoll,k  > 1  indicates
collision-dominated  trajectories.  For  large  particles  with  a  Newton-
based  drag,  τp  scales  with  d  and  thus  so  does  StΛ  (Eq.  (26)).  As  a

particles  are  less  likely  to  have  collision-dominated  trajectories  for  a
given particle volumetric concentration. If one considers small particles
with a linear drag (φ = const.), τp scales with d2 and thus so does StΛ. As a
result, Stcoll will scale with d for StΛ«1 indicating that very small particles
are also less likely to have collision-dominated trajectories for a given
αindicating intermediate sized particles are more likely to have four-way
coupling effects. However, it should be noted that the kinetic-based limit
may not be appropriate if the particles are too small.

In the other limit of very small particle inertias, Saffman & Turner
[67] investigated a diffusion-based collision mechanism by considering

two  particles  in  a  straining  region  associated  with  the  same
Kolmogorov-scale eddy. The particles are considered to have small sizes
and  response  times  relative  to  these  eddies,  i.e.,  d«η  and  Stη«1.  Inte-
grating  over  the  probability  distribution  function  of  relative  particle
velocities for this flow, the resulting diffusion-based collision frequency
per particle (fε) was obtained theoretically by Saffman &  Turner [67]
(with additional details in Sundaram & Collins [28]), as

fcoll,ε =

√

̅̅̅̅̅̅

for diffusion (cid:0) based collisions

136

The diffusion-based collision frequency increases rapidly with par-
ticle diameter but varies inversely with the Kolmogorov time scale. For
monodisperse particles, the corresponding collisional Stokes number is

Stcoll,ε ≡ τpfcoll,ε ≈ 1.24αStη

137

Thus, the relative importance of collisions increases with both par-
ticle concentration and inertia. Comparing Eq. (137) to Eq. (135), the
diffusion-based  Stokes  number  is  generally  smaller  than  the  kinetic-
based  Stokes  number,  which  is  consistent  with  particles  being  less
likely to collide if their trajectories are controlled by the same turbulent
eddy.

For  intermediate  particle  sizes,  one  may  expect  that  the  collision
frequency will have an upper bound given by the large-inertia kinetic-
based  theory  and  a  lower  bound  given  by  the  small-inertia  diffusion-
based theory. Such a trend is shown in Fig. 24, where the predictions of
collision rates indeed tend to the diffusion theory (Eq. (137)) for small
Stokes numbers and to the kinetic theory (Eq. (135)) for larger Stokes
numbers. This intermediate regime can be complex as it includes effects
of particle inertia, preferential concentration, and integral-scale turbu-
lence [68] and thus does not readily lend itself to theoretical analysis.
Therefore, empirical models are typically used and are a combination of
the  two  extreme  limits  [28,69,70].  One  such  combination  empirical
model for the turbulent collisional frequency is given as

fcoll ≈

fcoll,ε + StΛfcoll,k
1 + StΛ

for collisions in turbulence

138

This model yields the diffusion limit when StΛ  is very small and the
kinetic  limit  when  StΛ  is  very  large.  As  shown  in  Fig.  24,  this  simple
combination  provides  qualitative  agreement  with  simulations.  Unfor-
tunately,  no  direct  measurements  are  available  for  near  HIST  flows
for  experimental  validation.

Thus, particle collisions will be significant for Stcoll  > 0.1 and will
dominate for Stcoll > 0.1. However, preferential concentration effects can
cause  increased  local  concentrations,  such  that  the  above  models  for
Stcoll  may  underestimate  collisions  for  Stη~1.  This  collisional  Stokes
number in turbulence is typically much larger than that for other non-
turbulent  collision  mechanisms.  As  such,  four-way  coupling  effects
(particle collisions) are more likely to occur once turbulence is intro-
duced to a flow.

10. Multiphase coupling summary

The various coupling regimes for turbulent flow are summarized in
the  following  for  one-way  coupling  (turbulence  affects  the  particle
motion, but not vice versa), then for two-way coupling (particles affect
the  turbulence),  three-way  coupling  (the  particles  interact  fluid
dynamically  in  the  turbulence),  and  four-way  coupling  (turbulence
causes  particle  collisions).  For  the  one-way  coupling,  the  turbulent
Stokes  numbers  are  the  primary  indicator  of  the  particle’s  ability  to
follow  the  flow  and  this  coupling  can  be  summarized  in  order  of
increasing particle size/inertia as:

Stη«1particles closely follows all turbulent flow structure

Stη ∼ 1 particles partly follows the microscales
StΛ«1 particles closely follows integral (cid:0) scale structures

StΛ ∼ 1 particles partly follows the integral (cid:0) scale structures

StΛ»1 particles only weakly affected by turbulent structures

140

The  two-way,  three-way,  and  four-way  turbulent  coupling  criteria  of
Eqs. (130)–(132) and (139) can also be summarized as:

M > 0.05turbulence modulation is significant

α > 0.01 mean three (cid:0) way coupling is significant

M > 0.01 & Stη ∼ 1 local clustering bias is significant
α ̃>0.1 dense flow where three (cid:0) way coupling dominates

141

Stcoll > 0.1 four (cid:0) way coupling becomes significant

Stcoll > 10 dense flow where four (cid:0) way coupling dominates

Importantly, these coupling criteria do not account for detailed as-
pects such as domain geometry, non-linear drag, eddy-crossing effects,
anisotropic  and/or  non-homogenous  turbulence,  etc.  The  criteria  are
therefore simply qualitative guides.
