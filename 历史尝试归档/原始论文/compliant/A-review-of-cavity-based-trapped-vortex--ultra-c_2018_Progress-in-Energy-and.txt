Trapped vortex combustor (TVC) is different from conventional swirl-stabilized combustors. It takes advantages of a
cavity to stabilize the flame. When the cavity size of a TVC is well designed, a large rotating vortex can be formed in
the cavity. The vortex cannot shed out the cavity and is thus named a “locked” or “stable” vortex. One of the main
challenges for TVC design is fuel injection. Typically, fuel can be injected directly into the cavity or from the diffuser
upstream. Injecting from the diffuser leads to the fuel being mixed with the air before it enters the combustor. When
the fuel is injected directly into the cavity, it is desirable to supply the fuel in such way that the locked vortex in the
cavity is reinforced. Furthermore, the fuel-air mixing in the cavity will be promoted, as the bypass air is directly
added into the cavity. Since the recirculation zone anchored in the cavity is not exposed to the main incoming flow,
stable combustion is achieved, even in the presence of a high speed main flow as typically expected in Ramjets and
Scramjets. A well-designed trapped vortex combustor (TVC) enables a better fuel-air mixing, a better stabilized flame,
lower emission, ultra-compact and high efficient combustion to be achievable. As a promising combustion concept,
intensive scientific research has been conducted on TVC in the application areas of aerospace propulsion, power gen-
eration and waste incineration. In this work, we will firstly introduce the fundamental concepts, the development
and evolution history of TVCs. The combustion, aerodynamics, and aeroacoustics features of trapped vortex combus-
tion are then described. This includes reviewing and discussing the cavity flow/aerodynamics, fuel-air injection and
mixing, trapped vortex combustion, emission and combustion of alternative fuels, and aeroacoustics characteristics.
The ‘spin-off’ application of trapped vortex combustion concept for the design of ultra-compact and high-g combus-
tors, inter-turbine burners, in-Situ and flameless TVC reheat combustors are then reviewed and discussed. Various
practical applications of trapped vortex combustion concept in gas turbines, ramjets, scramjets and waste incinera-
tors are discussed and summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions of the design and implementation of
TVCs are provided.

1. Introduction

PFor propulsion and power generation systems, control of com-
bustion emission and stable combustion are two of the most critical
requirements [1], in addition to developing effective cooling tech-
nologies and innovative composite materials. Due to its impact on
environment and health, controlling combustion emissions such as
unburned hydrocarbons [2], carbon monoxide, particulate matter,
oxides of sulfur and NOx (nitrogen oxides) has been an active area of
great public concern since 19700s. Thus the combustion-involved
industries have undergone rapid changes in the combustion technol-
ogies used to meet the increased emission standard [1]. Carbon diox-
ide was initially not considered as pollutants in 19800s. However,
those combustion products are found to contribute to global warm-
ing a few decades ago. This leads to extensive international attention
and efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions too. In addition, the
reduction of NOx emissions has been receiving more and more atten-
tion due to its toxicity, it is a precursor to acid rain and chemical
smog, and it has direct impact on the ozone depletion in the strato-
sphere. To reduce NOx emissions, the dry low emissions (DLE)
approach [3] was introduced in the late 19800s. DLE approach as
shown schematically in Fig. 1(a) also minimized the need for costly
onsite requirement. The continued development of DLE approach
gave rise to NOx emissions from industrial gas turbines being
reduced to the levels between 2 and 25 ppm.

PThe majority of industrial gas turbines are not able to achieve
NOx emissions below 5 ppm. The implementation of expensive
exhaust gas after-treatment, such as selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) [4] is needed. The SCR technology means that highly toxic
ammonia needs to be injected into the exhaust stream to neutralize
these remaining emissions. However, such technique is not only
very costly, but also creates environmental hazards [4]. In addition,
SCR requires the storage and handling of ammonia. Generally, ther-
mal NOx is formed in the primary zone of the combustor. The highest
gas temperature and the associated thermal NOx emissions occur. A
decrease in the maximum temperature achieved at more lean condi-
tions, gives rise to reduced thermal NOx emissions [1,5]. However,
the CO emission is
the combustion chamber
approaches ‘lean extinction’ [5].

increased, as

PIn order to meet more and more stringent NOx emissions as
shown in Fig. 1(b) (< 5 ppm in the absence of SCR), industrial com-
bustors must be operated near the lean extinction limit [6]. As the
lean extinction limit is reached, the combustor temperature is too
low and the flame is very weak, and sudden ‘flameouts’ may occur
[7]. In addition, these combustors are more susceptible to combus-
tion instabilities [8,9]. These instabilities occur, when unsteady heat
release is ‘constructively’ coupled with the acoustic disturbances in

Pthe combustion system to produce large-amplitude limit cycle oscil-
lations (also known as combustion instability) [8,9]. Combustion-
driven oscillations [10,11] caused serious damages to the gas tur-
bines and aero-engines since early 1990 s [1]. Intensive research has
been conducted in the industrial gas turbines community to balance
extremely low emissions, with engine flameouts and the limit cycle
fluctuations.

PThe other critical requirement for propulsion and power genera-
tion systems is ‘stable combustion’ [12]. It is often achieved by using
recirculation zones to provide continuous sources of ignition, by
well mixing the combustion products with the fresh fuel and oxidant
reactants. Conventionally, swirl vanes [3], bluff-bodies [7] and rear-
ward-facing [9] steps are used as effective approaches to establish a
recirculation zone for flame stabilization. There is a broad literature
that has been established on these approaches. Interested readers
can refer to the excellent review papers [3,7,9] or any textbook on
combustion [13].

PTo meet these two critical requirements of low emissions and
stable combustion, the concept of trapped vortex combustion (TVC)
[14,15] can also be applied. It is fundamentally different from con-
ventional swirl-stabilized combustion as shown in Fig. 1(a) [3,16].
The TVC concept [17,18] employs a cavity to stabilize the flame (see
Fig. 1(c)). The actual stabilization mechanism associated with the
TVC is relatively simple (see Fig. 1(c)). A conventional bluff or fore-
body is located upstream of a smaller bluff body, which is commonly
referred to as an aft-body. The flow over the first bluff body sepa-
rates and develops shear layer instabilities. These instabilities in
most circumstances are responsible for
initiating a blowout
[19(cid:1)21]. The alternating array of vortices are conveniently trapped
or locked between the two bodies [22]. If the aft-body or the second
bluff body is absent, a regular dump-plane with a separation vortex
behind the step [9], which can be applied to stabilize the flame. This
is similar to the TVC concept. In the TVC concept, the cavity design
plays a critical role. If the cavity size is designed properly, then a
large vortex can be created and filled inside the cavity [22,23]. The
vortex will rotate smoothly. It does not shed out of the cavity and
thus “safely locked” in the cavity [23,24]. Fuel and air may be
injected directly into the cavity to promote the fuel-air mixing in the
cavity. Furthermore, injecting the fuel properly into the cavity may
reinforce the ‘locked’ vortex. The hot recirculation zone is well
‘locked’ in the cavity. And it does not expose to the main flow. This
enables a stable combustion being achieved, even in the presence of
a high speed main flow. Thus TVC shows great potential to provide
effective flame stabilization even at extremely lean conditions.

POne attractive feature of TVC is that it can be applied to handle a
high inlet velocity (supersonic or hypersonic) [25,26]. This high
velocity flow can also be associated with hydrogen-rich fuels, when

Pit is operated under lean premixed conditions. It is quite challenging
to burn high hydrogen content fuels, since the flame speed of hydro-
gen [27] is approximately 6 times that of natural gas. To prevent
flashback, the main flow velocity needs to be much larger than the
flame speed. However, this high flow velocity [28] creates problems
in establishing and maintaining the swirl-stabilized effect. The prob-
lem becomes more complicated in the design of lean premix com-
bustors, since flashback of the flame into the fuel injector causes
severe damages to the hardware and leads to engine failure. How-
ever, the TVC technology may be a good candidate [25,26,29] to pro-
vide a stable combustion with a lower pressure drop/loss and lower
acoustic emission resulting from cavity resonance and downstream
edge [30,31], even with a high inlet velocity flow.

PAnother critical feature of TVC design involves transporting and
mixing [32] the hot combustion products from the vortex locked in
the cavity into the main flow stream. This can be achieved by using
wake regions generated by bodies, or struts [33,34], immersed in the
main flow. By using geometric features to ignite the incoming fuel-
air mixture [35], instead of aerodynamic features, the trapped vortex
combustion is less sensitive to unstable combustion. This is particu-
larly important near the lean flame extinction limit, where small
flow fluctuations may give rise to flame extinction. In a TVC system,
very stable, yet more energetic, primary/core flame zone is resistant
to external flow field disturbances [36]. This enables the lean and
rich blowout limits being extended. Previous review [20] has shown
that the TVC configuration can withstand through-put velocities
below or above Mach number 1.0 (even in hypersonic engines). In
addition, TVC configuration has a larger flame-holding surface area.
Thus the TVC concept facilitates the design of more compact

Pcombustors (even ultra-compact [37]) with a shorter flame but a
higher combustion efficiency and a lower emission [38]. However,
the extremely hot recirculation zone with allied primary combustion
in the cavity leads to a high surface temperature gradient in the tran-
sition region. The associated high thermal gradient gives rise to a
higher stress level, even buckling and bending problems. This means
that effective cooling techniques [39] and innovative materials
[40(cid:1)43] are needed for the design of flame-holding cavities. Inade-
quate cooling may lead to excessive material temperature with
decreased reliability and durability. Thus cooling the cavity [39] and
developing innovative ceramic matrix composite materials [40,41]
will remain two of the key challenging technologies for the design
and application of TVCs. A number of cooling techniques such as
convective, film and effusion cooling, which are applied in modern
and future gas turbine engines, and their applications are well
reviewed and discussed in Ref. [39].

PTVC may become the next-generation combustion technology
[22], as conjectured by General Electric [44], National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) [45], Air Force Research Labora-
tory (AFRL) [14] and Innovative Scientific Solutions Inc. [36]. During
the past 4 decades, trapped vortex combustion has gained more and
more attention, as a promising flame-holding technology in subsonic
and supersonic engine systems. However, there are outstanding
questions concerning the design and effectiveness application of
TVC concept in practice such as

P1) What are the optimal cavity dimensions and it's geometry that
yield the most effective flame-holding capability with a mini-
mum pressure loss.

P2) What are the optimal configurations and locations of the fuel
and air injections that lead to the best mixing, flame-holding
and combustion performances.

P3) What are the effective cooling technologies to avoid excessive
heat transfer to the cavity walls and to decrease the pressure
losses and the drag penalties?

P4) If TVC is applied in propulsion systems operated at supersonic/
hypersonic flight conditions, then what are the effects of shock
wave, and how to maximize the residence time?

PThese questions need to be addressed by academic researchers
and industrial R&D engineers, and motivate extensive researches on
trapped vortex combustors (TVCs). Numerous experimental and
numerical investigations are conducted on TVCs to have a better

2. Concepts and development history of trapped vortex
combustor

PThe trapped vortex combustor (TVC) concept was proposed by
AFRL (Air Force Research Laboratory) in 1990s or late 1980s [14]. A
series of follow-up studies [46(cid:1)48] was conducted on aero-engine
flame stabilization. These initial studies were financially supported
by AFRL, the US Navy, and the Strategic Environmental Research
Development Program (SERDP) [49]. Fundamental studies, develop-
ment and application of TVC in aero-engines [24,42], land-based
power generation systems [44] are motivated by more and more
stringent NOx emission standards and how to prevent the onset of
self-sustained combustion instability [2,9,11] associated with lean
premixed engines.

PBefore describing the physics and features of a TVC, it is useful to
briefly outline the essential features of a conventional gas turbine
combustor [51]. A simplified swirl-stabilized combustion system
[3,15] is considered as shown in Fig. 2(a). It has a primary recircula-
tion zone that is established by a swirler located around the fuel
injector. Some of the hot combustion products are transported back
towards the combustor face and ignite the incoming fuel and air, as
they are mixed in the combustion chamber. In this way, continu-
ously combustion and stable flame are provided. Combustion stabil-
ity is achieved by the recirculation zones in the forward corners of
the combustor. If the inlet air flow velocity is quite high, the swirl

Pnumber is increased. And the primary recirculation zone becomes
unstable, depending on the swirl number. This will lead to poor
flame stability and lower combustion efficiency. For this, a diffuser is
applied to slow down the combustion inlet air and to avoid an unsta-
ble primary zone being created. The air used for combustion is typi-
cally considered to be the primary airflow. Excessive air is provided
and injected through perforated liners [52,53] into the combustion
chamber for cooling and achieving lean combustion. Such cooling
flow is known as a ‘secondary’ air flow. The ‘secondary’ air is used to
mix and to shape the temperature profile of the exhaust gases, as it
enters the turbine vanes. This ‘secondary’ air is also used to dilute
and decrease temperature, which is so high as to cause damages to
the turbine vanes.

PA trapped vortex combustion system is schematically shown in
Fig. 2(b). The similarities and significant differences between a TVC
and the conventional swirler-stabilized combustor can be clearly
observed by comparing Fig. 2(a) and (b). The cavity employed in the
TVC configuration [55] is properly sized so that it has a stable recir-
culation zone over a wide range of main airflow conditions. This can
be achieved by applying a relatively low-pressure drop across the
combustor. The fuel and air are injected directly into the cavities to
reinforce the vortex [56]. Based on the cavity fuel and air injections,
there is a cavity equivalence ratio. On the other hand, an overall
equivalence ratio is defined as the total fuel and air injected in the
engine system. Ignition of the main combustor is achieved, as the
main fuel and air mix with the hot products from the pilot flame.
The recirculation zones behind the struts [57] function like flame-
holders that are similar to those used in afterburners. The rapid mix-
ing in the wakes behind the struts promotes a rapid combustion. In
addition, the struts help to distribute the exit gases so that an
acceptable radial profile and pattern-factor can be achieved without
using liner jets [52,53]. Because the pilot flame is shielded from the
main flow by the cavity, stable and efficient combustion can be
achieved [58], even in the presence of a high inlet velocity flow.

PIn concept, the TVC seems to be simple [56]. However, it has great
potential to provide better performances and lower emissions.
Because of the stable recirculation zones in the flame-holding cavi-
ties, a TVC is expected to have low lean-blow-out (LBO) limits and
good altitude relight capabilities. If rapid mixing can be achieved in
the flame-holding cavities, then a TVC can achieve a higher combus-
tion efficiency over a wider operating range. Low NOx emission can
be achieved through different implementation strategies. One is to
rapidly mix the oxidant and the fuel. Another one is to operate a TVC
as a staged system with lean or premixed combustion. When a TVC
is operated at high inlet velocities, low thermal NOx could also be
achieved as a result of the reduced residence time. Finally, a TVC can
be operated as rich-burn quick-quench lean-burn (RQL) combustor
[58]. The cavities provide the rich-burn mode and the rapid mixing,
while the main air (no main fuel) provides the quick-quench
lean-burn modes. Whether these strategies can be successfully

Pimplemented is a question that will be addressed in this review of
the development history of TVC designs in the following subsec-
tions.

2.1. First generation TVC

PThe earliest design of a TVC [15] involves an axisymmetric config-
uration with only an outer cavity and no diffuser or struts employed.
However, this configuration does not result in stable combustion,
because the cavities were too large. A more flexible configuration
was then proposed and tested, where the cavity size could be
changed and the flame in the cavity can be clearly observed. This
was demonstrated in the first generation TVC [35,59], as shown in
Fig. 3. The two disks in tandem are used to form a cavity. And the
cavity length could be changed by moving the tube attached to the
cavity back face out or in. Across the back face of the cavity, propane
and air were injected separately. It was found by trial and error that
a stable combustion is achieved with an after-disk diameter of
0.73D0 and a cavity length of 0.59D0. Here D0 is the diameter for the
forward disk. Furthermore, a stable vortex is locked in the proper-
size cavity and stable flames are observed.

PTo determine the optimum size of a flame-holding cavity, the
rules for sizing cavities were studied [60,61] to reduce the drag of
bluff-bodies in non-reacting flows. An optimal separation distance
was found [61] for a ratio of afterbody-to-forebody disk diameters
less than 1, where the drag was minimized. The minimum drag was
found [60] to correspond to the condition where a stable recircula-
tion zone is created. To validate the findings of the previous works
[60,61] and to predict the combusting results of the 1st generation
TVC, a time-dependent axisymmetric mathematical model was
developed and applied [62] to examine three different size cavities,
i.e. (1) undersized, (2) right-size and (3) oversized. When the cavity
is undersized, the drag is relatively large because of shedding from
the after-disk. However, when the cavity is properly sized, a stable
vortex is formed in the cavity and in the near-wake region of the
after-disk, the drag is a minimum. Also, very little fluid is entrained
into the cavity. The entrainment of the main flow into the cavity of
TVC is found to depend on the cavity optimum dimensions. The opti-
mum size relatively restricts the entrainment of the main air flow
into the cavity compared to the non-optimal cavities. This means
that the stabile cavity vortex is the best choice for flame stabiliza-
tion. However, it may not be the best solution from the point of view
of fuel-air mixing, as discussed in Ref. [63]. In addition, the reacting
flow simulations [35,62] revealed that the dynamic vortices locked
in the cavity with the air and fuel injected did not shed, even though

Pthe cavity size was determined based on non-reacting cold-flow
conditions. It is also noted that when the vortex is trapped in the
cavity, the stagnation point is located at the downstream corner of
the cavity. This observation is similar to that of Ref. [64]. When the
cavity is too large, the vortex in the cavity is unsteady and the drag
is large. In general, a cavity which is properly sized for a minimum
drag for non-reacting flows is found to be the optimum size for a sta-
ble combustion in a reacting flow. The first generation TVC was
found to have LBO limits considerably below those of conventional
combustors and operate stably over a wide range of inlet air veloci-
ties and F/A (fuel to air) ratios [35,59].

2.2. Second generation TVC

PThe 2nd generation TVC is an axisymmetric can-type configura-
tion [15]. Different from the 1st generation TVC, the 2nd generation
has the cavity surrounding the casing instead of the combustor cen-
ter as shown in Fig. 4(a). And there are several struts or flame hold-
ers in front of the cavity. The second generation TVC is designed to
improve lean-blow-out and combustion efficiency [35,36,49], as
shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b) respectively. A typical axisymmetric can-
type configuration of 2nd generation TVC is illustrated in Fig. 4(a).
The cavity depth is about the same as that for the optimum deigns of
the first generation TVC. The depths of the forward and back wall are
29.8 mm and 21.5 mm respectively. The length of the cavity is
50.5 mm, somewhat longer than that of the first generation TVC. The
outer circumferential wall of the cavity is made of quartz. The diam-
eter is about 152.4 mm. The struts result in a 50% blockage of the
inlet area to the main combustor. Across the back face of the cavity,
gaseous propane and air are injected. Each fuel jet is surrounded by
4 air jets. The cavity air flow is controllable and metered indepen-
dently of the main airflow. To promote mixing, ignition, flame-hold-
ing and distribution of the heat for the main burner circumferential
struts or splitters are used. The fuel and air are premixed at the inlet
of the burner.

PThe most impressive aspect of the second generation TVC is its
large dynamic operating range [50,55]. The overall equivalence ratio
could be rapidly changed from 1 to 0.05 and then back to 1. The LBO
performance of the 2nd generation TVC is shown in Fig. 5(a). Here
only the cavity is fueled. The LBO experiments are conducted by
establishing a flame in the cavity with a fixed main airflow rate. The
fuel flow rate is slowly reduced until the visible flame in the cavity is
extinguished. This process is repeated at a different main airflow
rate. The 2nd generation TVC exhibited LBO limits significantly
below those of an advanced combustor that uses swirl to stabilize

Pthe flame [3,15,51]. Both the advanced and TVC combustors are
operated at atmospheric pressure. Fig. 5(b) compares the combus-
tion efficiency of the 2nd generation TVC, the advanced combustor
and a current combustor as a function of total fuel flow. TVC is found
to be associated with a higher combustion efficiency. In general, the
2nd generation TVC exhibited excellent LBO capabilities and efficient
operation over a wide dynamic range. Furthermore, this TVC is not
susceptible to combustion instabilities [2,9,11], as typically encoun-
tered in lean premixed pre-vaporized (LPP) combustors.

2.3. Third generation TVC

POne of main challenges is how to inject liquid fuel into the cavity
in a way that can be easily implemented in practice. Since most of
fuel needs to be injected near the main combustor inlet, the number
of penetrations through the high-pressure case should remain to be
a minimum [37,45]. Furthermore, the plumbing should be as simple
as possible. This means that injecting the liquid fuel from the front
face of the cavity is a good option. Thus, the key challenge is to deter-
mine the optimum locations in the cavity for the fuel nozzles and
primary combustion air jets. These challenges are solved in the 3rd
generation TVC. Fig. 4(b) illustrates a two/three-dimensional sector
of the 3rd generation TVC designed for optical viewing and easy
replacement of the cavities [15]. The cavities are built by properly
placing square tubes. This design allowed the fabrication of the cavi-
ties with different patterns of air jets and pressure atomizer fuel

Pnozzles to be achieved easily. Illustrations of the air- and fuel-injec-
tion sites are also provided in Fig. 4(b). The struts and splitter plate
act as flame holders to promote mixing and igniting the hot products
transported from the cavities with the premixed fuel and air of the
main combustor [50].

PDetailed studies performed on the 3rd generation TVC showed
that the main vortices in the double vortex and the single vortex
configurations are safely ‘trapped’ in the cavities for all operating
conditions. No combustion instabilities
[3,11,12] have been
observed from these two configurations. However, combustion
instability [59] was found to be related to the location of the fuel
nozzles and it has been observed for several other configurations.
Some experimental results obtained from the 3rd generation TVC
are summarized in Fig. 6(a)(cid:1)(c) [15]. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the dou-
ble vortex cavity design provided the lowest LBO limits. Certainly,
all three TVC designs shown in Fig. 6 had LBO limits below those of
conventional combustion systems operating at the same conditions.
The comparison of combustion efficiencies is made as shown in
Fig. 6(b). Again the double vortex design exhibited the highest com-
bustion efficiency at the lowest overall equivalence ratio. The TVC
designs are associated with a relatively higher combustion effi-
ciency than the conventional combustor, whether ethanol fuel or
JP-8 fuel is burned. Fig. 6(c) indicates that a TVC could have a wide
operating range.

PTo determine the optimum location of the air and fuel injection
sites in the cavities, 19 cavity configurations with different patterns

figurations for injecting fuel and air into cavity [15]. Reprinted from [15] with permission of Dr. D. Shouse and D. Burrus.

Pof air and fuel injections were proposed and evaluated. In all the
designs, the fuel is injected from the cavity's front face. Ethanol and
JP-8 fuel are chosen in the experiment because of its low heating
value. The optimum overall performances are obtained from two
cavity designs as shown in Fig. 6(d) and (e). A cooling approach was
also examined for the back face and corners of the cavities as shown
schematically in Fig. 6(f). While a small vortex is also produced near
the aft corner of the cavity, double vorticities are generated by a line
of air jets located deep on the front face of the cavity and near the
center of the aft face of the cavity. Locating the fuel deep in the cav-
ity plays a critical role in achieving good idle performance. The single
vortex design is shown in Fig. 6(e); the fuel injectors are located just
above the centerline of the front face of the cavity. Small variations
in the location of the fuel injectors have a strong effect on the com-
bustor performance.

PThere are some interests in evaluating the TVC concept for a
number of practical applications. The National Energy Technology
Laboratory (NETL) is interested in reducing NOx emission from
power-generation gas turbine engines that burn low-Btu fuels [15].
These fuels contain fuel-bound nitrogen (FBN) [2] compounds such
as ammonia. An RQL combustor approach is one possible way to
stop the FBN from becoming NOx. Experiments have been conducted
with the 3rd generation TVC to determine whether the TVC, oper-
ated in a RQL mode, could stop some of the FBN from becoming NOx.
These experiments have been conducted at atmospheric conditions,
with ethanol fuel supplied. Pyridine or butylamine were used as an
additives to simulate FBN compounds. Experimental tests were con-
ducted with one cavity fueled and two cavities fueled. With combus-
tion in both cavities, only about 17% of FBN was converted to NOx.
These results are quite encouraging, since these are the first FBN
experiments performed with a TVC. NETL has designed an RQL/TVC

Pcombustor [58] for conducting follow-up research at their Morgan-
town Laboratory.

2.4. Fourth generation TVC

PThe experimental studies on the 3rd generation TVC provided
useful information needed to design two high pressure TVC sectors
for evaluating the TVC operated under realistic pressure and inlet air
temperature conditions. This is the 4th generation TVC. A double
vortex and a single vortex cavity were designed in a high-pressure
sector rig located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [15]. Also, a
dual-passage and a tri-passage diffuser were designed for this rig.
There are 4 TVC configurations being examined [54]. The first config-
uration involves a high pressure TVC including a dual-passage dif-
fuser and a double or single vortex cavity arrangement. These
arrangements are illustrated in Fig. 7(a) and (b) and are referred to
as the 2P-2 V and 2P-1 V TVC.

PA total of 54 fuel injectors are applied in the 2P-1/2 V TVC sector.
This large number of fuel injectors facilitates good distribution and
mixing of the fuel and air. A tri-passage diffuser with double vortex
cavities (3P-2 V TVC) is shown in Fig. 7(c). It is constructed in essen-
tially the same way as the 2P-2 V TVC sector. The cavity and diffuser
components could also be configured for 2P-1 V and 3P-1 V TVCs.
These configurations are not shown, because very few experiments
have been conducted with them. This is due to the instability that
resulted from single vortex cavity design [15]. The cavity fuel injec-
tors were located deep in the cavities. Some of the fuel was trans-
ported directly into the main air stream. This burning fuel appeared
to couple to the small vortex that is shed over the aft-wall corner of
the cavity. This small vortex resulted from the way in which air is

Pused to cool the aft face of the cavity. A similar vortex occurs in the
double vortex cavity design.

PThe Air Force combustion facility [49,50] where the TVC sectors
were evaluated was designed with full optical access to the inside of
a TVC sector. Fig. 7(d) is a photograph of the 3P-2 V TVC operating
with the cavities and the main fueled. It can be seen that the main
fuel spray from the center air passage has collapsed. Indeed, a closer
observation of the flame showed that the fuel spray has collapsed
for all of the main fuel nozzles. However, the center passage created
the major problem, since there was not adequate heat at the exit of
the center air passage to vaporize the fuel. This problem can be
solved partially by replacing the tri-passage [45] fuel spray bars with
the bi-passage spray bars. Thus, only the outer main air passages are
fueled.

PAssessment of the performance revealed that the prototype 4th
generation TVC test rig had exceeded all initial expectations. A more
detailed description of the TVC sectors and the high-pressure test
results can be found in Ref. [54]. Some results from the 3P-2 V TVC
are presented in Fig. 8. The LBO characteristics of the 3P-2 V TVC is
shown in Fig. 8(a). Comparison is then made between the 4th gener-
ation TVC and the blow out characteristics for two conventional
swirl stabilized combustors [49,50]. The LBO limits for the TVC are
found to be about 50% below those for the conventional combustors.
Furthermore, the TVC LBO limits do not depend strongly on the load-
ing parameters as those for conventional combustors. Fig. 8(b) illus-
trates the altitude relight capabilities of the 4th generation TVC. The
TVC altitudes relight is found to be considerably better than that for
swirl-stabilized combustors. Conventional combustors have a relight
capability of about 9 km. There appears to be significant improve-
ments in relight capability. Fig. 8(c) illustrates the large operating

Prange of the TVC. Effective combustion efficiencies above 99% were
achieved for an overall equivalence ratio between 0.12 and 0.82.
This represents about a 40% wider range than that typically achieved
by conventional gas turbine combustion systems. Fig 8(d) shows the
exit gas temperature profile across the duct height with cavity-only
and with cavity-plus-main-combustor operations. Results are shown
for two fuel-air ratios with the main and cavities operating. The tem-
perature profiles are relatively flat, even with cavity only operation,
which is a good indication that the struts are evenly distributing the
hot products transported out of the cavities. Although the tempera-
ture profiles of rigs do not always accurately reflect those of annular
combustors of the same design, the temperature data do offer the
potential of achieving low pattern factors with the TVC without the
use of liner jets.

2.5. High inlet velocity/pressure TVC

PThe potential of applying TVC such as 3P-2 V configuration in
ramjet and scramjet engine systems is recently evaluated via con-
ducting high-speed experiments at NASA Glenn [48,50]. The high
inlet velocities were obtained in the experiments via increasing the
pressure drop across the combustor. In a ramjet, this pressure drop
could be generated by ram air, not by the upstream plenum. The
experiments have been conducted with cavities only fueled and at 3
fuel-air ratios. Although these experiments do not simulate a ramjet
operation, they do provide some insights into the operation of the
cavity at high inlet velocities. Stable cavity flames were clearly
observed. And the vortex well trapped in the cavity became more
intense and smaller with an increased pressure drop. Fig. 9(a) shows
the variation of the measured combustion efficiency with the fuel/

Pair ratio. The combustion efficiency is found to remain above 99% for
a cavity equivalence ratio between 1.2 and 3.8. The efficiency for the
higher inlet velocity condition was essentially over the full range of
the primary equivalence ratios tested. Fig. 9(b) shows the measured
NOx emission index. The TVC gives a 55% reduction in NOx for the
advanced commercial engine cycle as compared to the 1996 ICAO
standard [15]. This suggests that NOx production can be significantly
reduced with a TVC operating with a high inlet-air velocity. These
promising results offer strong support that a TVC is a good candidate
for powering a ramjet. A joint program is in progress with NASA
Glen to further evaluate the TVC as a hypersonic combustion system.

3. Characteristics of trapped vortex combustor

PTVC involves multi-physics and characteristics such as 1)
cavity aerodynamics [56] and aeroacoustics [65], 2) fuel (liquid
or gas) injection and fuel-air mixing [66(cid:1)68], 3) vortex-combus-
tion characteristics
[71,72].
Extensive research has already been conducted to shed lights on
the fundamental physics and mechanisms of such cavity-based
flame holders. We will review and discuss the characteristics
of trapped vortex combustion systems [73,74] in the following
subsections.

3.1. Cavity flow and aerodynamics characteristics

PUnderstanding the fluid dynamics of cavities in a cross flow (sub-
sonic [56,75] or supersonic [23,76]) is critical to ensure appropriate
fuel-air ratio in TVCs and appropriate temperature distributions
downstream of the combustor. For this, a number of researchers
[29,60,77] studied the flow characteristics of a stable/locked vortex
after-body, since the aerodynamic drag is decreased in the presence
of a cavity attached behind. When incoming air flows subsonically
over a cavity created by a fore- and after-body disk, there are 4 flow
regimes as shown in Fig. 10(a)(cid:1)(d).

PThe 4 regimes include: (1) the wake backflow, (2) the unsteady
cavity vortex, (3) the steady cavity vortex and (4) the compressed
cavity vortex. For the 1st and 2nd flow regimes, the vortices gener-
ated between the fore- and after-body are not fully included in the
cavity. They are still somehow related to the downstream recircula-
tion zone. The vortices are under the influence of wake flow down-
stream of the after-body. Experimental test [60] confirmed that
these vortices are unstable. When the after-body is placed at a cer-
tain distance from the fore-body such that no flow is spilled over the
after-body, a stable vortex occurs and the flowing fluid in the main
stream moves smoothly over the cavity. In this case, the cavity is
filled with a ‘large rotating’ vortex [84]. Now the stagnation point in
this regime is on the after-body's top surface, and disconnected with
the wake. For this, the cavity vortex is found to be ‘locked safely’
inside. The compressed cavity vortex as shown in Fig. 10(d) is pres-
ent, when the cavity length is greater than that of the steady vortex
regime. The cavity vortex is elongated and compressed by the main
flow. The stagnation point is on the after-body's front surface. This
means that the flow in the main stream goes into the cavity directly.
The direct flow impingement on the after-body's front surface gives
rise to a large undesirable drag being produced from a large pressure
increase. The compressed cavity vortex is found to be unstable, since

Pthere is a strong and continuous exchange of fluid between main
flow and the cavity [29,60].

PThe momentum ratios and cavity sizes were found to play impor-
tant roles on affecting mass exchange in a subsonic TVC. The acetone
PLIF Measurements [79] reveals that the vortices were locked in the
cavity, as the cavity aspect ratio is varied. In addition, the fuel-air
ratio and inlet Mach number were shown to influence the flame and
combustion dynamics, as experimentally visualized [69] in a single-
cavity trapped vortex combustor (see Fig. 11(a) and (b)). Fig. 11(c)(cid:1)
(h) shows the images illustrating the effects of increasing fuel-air
ratio (FAR) and increasing inlet Mach number on the visible length
and the physical appearance of the flames. As FAR is set to 0.008 and
the inlet Mach number is increased, as shown in Fig. 11(c)(cid:1)(e), the
flames are all confined within the cavities. The flame length becomes
shorter and the color of the flames is changed from yellow to blue.
This indicates more intense combustions at high-velocity flow con-
ditions. However, as the inlet Mach number remains unchanged but
FAR is increased, the flame length is increased.

PCold-flow non-reacting tests were also conducted [69] to gain
insights on vortical flow patterns within the cavity, turbulence
intensity distribution and interaction between the cavity stream and
mainstream. It is found that the flow in the cavity features a dual-
vortex pattern, as shown in Fig. 12, whereas in the plane along with
the radial strut, the single-vortex flow pattern is established in the
cavity. Mixing and interaction between the cavity stream and main-
stream occurs mainly in the wake regions of radial struts. Combus-
tion tests [69] are then carried out with preheated air (473 K) at
atmospheric pressure using liquid kerosene. Flame images at differ-
ent operating conditions are obtained as shown in Fig. 11(c)(cid:1)(h).
The effects of the fuel/air ratio and the inlet Mach number on the
cavity flames are examined. The flame length is found to increase as
the fuel/air ratio is increased. As the inlet Mach number is increased,
the flame becomes shorter and the color changes from yellow to

Pblue, indicating more intense or complete combustion. The combus-
tion efficiency is in the range of 92%¡100%. Furthermore, good flame
stability is achieved, since the fuel to air ratio at lean blow out (LBO)
is in the range from 0.0043 to 0.0056, as the inlet Mach number is
varied from 0.15 to 0.3. However, the fuel injection in the main-
stream and the combustion performance evaluation at high-temper-
ature, high-pressure operating conditions are not studied.

PThe experimental measurements on a low NOx subsonic TVC
combustor [70] revealed that a stable combustion is achieved by a
large recirculation zone with distributed combustion and nearly uni-
form temperature values that exceed the auto-ignition temperature
values. Fig. 13 shows the measured velocity vectors and concentra-
tions of the chemical species such as NOx, O2, CHC, CO and CO2. It
revealed that in the regions of higher temperatures, the O2 concen-
trations are relatively low. This contributes dramatically to hinder
the NO formation via the classical thermal mechanism. In the recir-
culation zone, the O2 concentrations are relatively low and the CO2
concentrations are relatively high. This clearly indicated the pres-
ence of recirculated combustion product gases originating from
regions where the oxidation process is already in a more advanced
stage.

PLES (large-eddy simulations) [82,83] with an immersed boundary
method implemented were conducted on a subsonic TVC for the
non-reacting and reacting flows. The photo and schematic of the
trapped vortex combustor are shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b) respec-
is based on tabulated chemistry

Passociated with a presumed PDF (PCM-FPI) for premixed flames. The
vortical structure of the cavity flow with PIV measurements and LES
predictions are shown in Fig. 14(c) and (d). Good agreement is
observed. The effect of swirling is shown in Fig. 14(e) and (f). A
strong modification of the cavity flow dynamics is clearly observed.
Furthermore, two coherent structures of same sizes keep the flow in
the cavity, with its emptying mainly affected by the upper vortex.
Fig. 14(g) and (h) illustrate the trapped vortex combustion with a
beta-presumed PDF and a premixed flamelet tabulated chemistry,
which is characterized by progress variable F as defined in Ref. [82]
and temperature. These studies indicate that the cavity seems to be
an interesting option for fuel-lean burning.

PThere are current interests in whether spinning motion can
improve the fuel-air mixing and combustion performance in TVCs. It
is found in Refs. [78,84] that stable cavity flows are achieved in a
higher subsonic TVC without and with a spinning motion, as shown
in Fig. 15(a) and (b) respectively. The non-reacting case was studied
by conducting LES simulations via the JETCODE developed at Stan-
ford University [78]. The 3D streamlines viewed in the relative refer-
ence frame are also obtained, as shown in Fig. 15.

P3D streamlines in combusting flows without and with the spin-
ning motions are shown in Fig. 16(a) and (b) respectively. Compared
with 3D flow in the non-spinning case as shown in Fig. 16(a), obvi-
ous 3D flow features are clearly seen in the cavity and in the wake
region as the spinning motion is involved as shown in Fig. 16(b). The
flow near the combustor centerline still rotates as shown in Fig. 16

P(b). As the rotating reference frame spins at 30,000 rpm, the rotating
streamlines indicate that there is a higher spinning rate. The com-
bustion efficiency of the TVC in the absence or presence of the spin-
ning motion is illustrated in Fig. 16(c). The spinning motion is found
to lead to an increased combustion efficiency close to the spinning
disc. The improved performance can be explained by the increased
fuel-air mixing resulted from the spinning motion.

PFurther non-reacting study [85] on investigating the TVC oper-
ated in swirling flow reveals attractive cold flow-field characteristics
and the stability of the locked vortex in different swirling flow con-
ditions. Three dimensional unsteady simulations are performed by
solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier(cid:1)Stokes (RANS) equations
with the commercial flow solver ANSYS FLUENT v16.1. The Reynolds
Stress Model (RSM) is selected for the turbulence closure to better
predict the anisotropic turbulence features encountered in highly

Pswirling flows. Validation with the experimental data shows that the
RSM model can provide rather good agreements for flows with a
swirl number up to S = 0.98. Numerical results of the swirling TVC
reveal that the cavity vortex can still be trapped well in flows with 2
different swirl numbers, as shown in Fig. 17(a) and (b) respectively.

PDue to the swirling flows, strong tangential motion is introduced
into the cavity vortex, and vortex breakdown is established in the
sudden expansion region of the TVC. Turbulence kinetic energy and
turbulence intensity are significantly increased by around 300%. This
indicates the fuel-air mixing can be dramatically improved. A flow
disturbance, swirl number suddenly changing from 0.6 to 0.98, is
added to the TVC to study the stability of vortices. The transient
results show that the cavity vortex is quite resistant to the flow dis-
turbances and is still trapped well in the cavity, while vortex shed-
ding is observed in the conventional breakdown vortex region when

Pthe flow disturbances is added. This study reveals that the TVC is a
promising combustor concept for swirling flow operations, not only
because of high turbulence levels that is good for mixing, but also
because the cavity vortex for flame stabilization is more robust.

PSupersonic flow over cavities has also been extensively studied
[86(cid:1)88], because of the strong relevance to the development of ram-
jets [89] and scramjets [23,90]. The main idea is to create a recircula-
tion region inside the cavity with a hot pool of radicals. This will
reduce the induction time, and enables auto-ignition of the fuel/air
mixture being achieved. When a cavity is exposed to a high-speed
cross flow, the cavity may experience self-sustained flow oscillations
[87,90]. Thus pressures, densities and velocities in and around the
cavity will be fluctuating. This will lead to drag penalties. Fig. 18
shows the magnitude of pressure fluctuation on the bottom of the
cavity (see Fig. 18(a)) and drag coefficient (see Fig. 18(b)) for differ-
ent length-to-depth raitos L/D [23]. When the oscillatory mode
inside the cavity is changed from transverse mode to a longitudinal
one, there was a sharp rise of oscillatory level and drag. With
increased L/D, the fluctuation magnitude is decreased, while the
drag coefficient is increased significantly.

PCavity supersonic flow can be categorized into two basic flow
regimes, depending strongly on the length-to-depth ratio L/D [23].
For L/D < 7(cid:1)10, the cavity flow is ‘open’ (see Fig. 19(a)), since the
upper shear layer reattaches to the back face. For L/D > 10(cid:1)13, the
cavity flow is ‘closed’ (see Fig. 19(b)), since the free shear layer reat-
taches to the lower wall. In both cases, a shear layer is separated

Pfrom the upstream lip and reattached downstream [91]. The critical
length-to-depth ratio corresponding to a transition between differ-
ent cavity flow regimes depends strongly on the boundary-layer
thickness at the leading edge of the cavity, the flow Mach number,
and the cavity width. Larger aspect ratio cavities are associated
with longitudinal oscillations [92], while small aspect ratio cavities
(L/D < 2(cid:1)3) are dominated by transverse oscillations [93]. The drag
of the cavity is increased by the high pressure at the rear faces as a
result of the shear layer impingement. Large drag losses result from
the pressure increase in the back wall vicinity and the pressure
decrease in the front wall (see Fig. 19(b)).

PA cavity with self-sustained oscillations [90,91] is defined to be
unstable. And many experimental and computational studies [91]
have been conducted to better understand the physics of cavity
flows and the means to control their nature. The self-sustained flow
fluctuations consist of two types of flow disturbances. One is charac-
terized by broadband small amplitude pressure fluctuations typical
of turbulent shear layers. The other consists of discrete resonances
whose amplitude, frequency, and harmonics depend strongly on the
cavity geometry and external flow conditions. Open cavities [23]
were found experimentally to be dominated by transverse or longi-
tudinal mode oscillations (see Fig. 19(a)), which depend on the Mach
number M1 and L/D. In a short cavity filled by a single large vortex,
the oscillation is excited by a transverse mode. The transition from
transverse to longitudinal mode oscillation was found to occur near
L/D = 2 at M1 = 1.5 and between L/D = 2 and 3 at M1 = 2.5. However,

where cI is defined as the normalized sound speed in the cavity,
which is assumed to be equal to that in a stagnating free-stream.
DF corresponding to a time delay Dt = DF/v is assumed to result
from the effect of pressure waves reflection at the bottom wall of
the cavity.

PCavity flame-holders can be designed to involve with a cone-strut
or guide vane to improve flame stabilization capacity [94(cid:1)96]. To
achieve a stabilized flame in a Ma = 3.25 Scramjet combustor over a
wider equivalence ratio range, a cone-strut is introduced to a cavity
flame-holder. The experimental results show that the flame-holding
range is broaden by approximately 50% [94,95]. A guided vane could
also be designed and introduced to TVC to improve the fuel-air mix-
ing in the cavity. Preliminary numerical non-reacting simulations
show that introducing the guided vane will introduce about 5% of
drag penalty. However, the combustion efficiency can be increased
by approximately 14% [96].

PSelf-excited combustion-driven oscillations also known as com-
bustion instability have been found [97(cid:1)99] to occur in combustion
systems with a cavity flame-holder, even in supersonic flow condi-
tions. The underlying mechanism was shown to due to the coupling
between transient combustion response and unsteady flow motion
in a confined volume, where acoustic pressure waves can be excited
and sustained. This mechanism is typically applied to explain the
combustion instability occurred in subsonic conditions. However,
under supersonic flow conditions, acoustic pressure waves cannot
propagate upstream. And flow oscillations generated in the flame
zone can simply travel downstream and exit from the engine. Thus
no feedback loop is formed, which is essential to sustain combustion
and flow instabilities. However, combustion instability with fre-
quencies of 100(cid:1)400 Hz was experimentally observed in an ethyl-
ene-fueled scramjet combustor as reported in Refs [97,98]. The
generation mechanism is identified to be the interaction between
unsteady heat release fluctuations in the flame zone and the tran-
sient responses in pre-combustion shock and fuel mixing respec-
tively. The onset of combustion instability in TVCs depends strongly
on the flight/flow conditions and inflow stagnation temperature
[98]. A series of experiments are conducted on a Ma = 4.0 Scramjet
combustor with a cavity flame-holder confined to evaluate the
effects of (1) the cavity location, (2) its length to depth ratio and (3)
aft-wall angle on combustion-driven oscillations. The experiments
reveal that combustion instability does occur in supersonic engines
with a cavity flameholder, which is generally assumed to be unlikely
to occur.

PResidence time of the supersonic and subsonic flow inside a cav-
ity depends on the mass exchange rate in and out of the cavity. In
the open cavities, mass and momentum transfer mechanisms are
determined by the vortex structure inside the cavity and the longitu-
dinal oscillations. It is numerically demonstrated [100] that there
was one large vortex stationed near the trailing edge of the cavity
and a secondary vortex near the upstream wall. The large trailing
vortex interacts with the unstable shear layer and determines the
mass exchange of the cavity. As the trailing edge vortex occupies a
larger volume inside the cavity, the mass exchange is increased and
the flow residence time inside the cavity is decreased. It is worth
noting that for some applications, supersonic cavity oscillating flow
is undesirable such as weapons bay. To prevent or mitigate this oscil-
lating cavity flow, a triangular bump or a sub-cavity can be designed
near the leading edge of the cavity. Interested readers can refer to
the interesting work [101].

3.2. Fuel injection and fuel-air mixing characteristics

PIn the trapped vortex combustor geometry, the mainstream fluid
is difficult to enter into the recirculation area in the cavity (typi-
cally < 3% of the total vortex mass) [79]. This means that reactants
need to be injected directly into the cavity. In this way, a very effi-
cient turbulent mixing of reactants is achieved. This fuel-air injec-
tion strategy also compensates for the lack of oxidizer due to a low
fluid exchange between the mainstream flow and vortex region. Fur-
thermore, the vortex itself in the cavity can be strengthened by the
direct injection of reactants, thus being stabilized over a wide range
of the inlet airflow and fuel rates. This indicates that some form of
fuel- oxidant premixing may occur in the cavity, even while the
flameless combustion mode [102,103] can be combined with
trapped vortex combustion.

PThe mass injection can change the dynamic characteristics of the
flow inside and around the cavity dramatically. This is numerically
demonstrated [35,36] by using a third-order accurate, time-depen-
dent CFD with chemistry code. The dynamic flow associated with an
axisymmetric, center-body TVC was studied under both non-react-
ing and reacting conditions. The effect of mass injection in the cavity
on pressure coefficient was summarized in Fig. 20. It is shown that
the pressure coefficient is decreased with the injection mass. And
the pressure coefficient for 180% injection becomes nearly steady.
However, the frequency of the oscillations is decreased with injec-
tion mass. It was also found that the mass injection can increase the
optimum cavity size (width-to-diameter ratio). As a small amount of
fluid (< 50% with respect to the primary fuel and air injection) was
injected into a non-optimum cavity, the flow unsteadiness was
increased as shown in Fig. 20. The simulations also revealed that a
thinner after-body can lead to the cavity flow being more dynamic.

PThe fuel-air momentum ratio is found to play a critical role on
influencing the mixing and vortex structure in a cavity. This is exper-
imentally illustrated by conducting both PLIF (planar laser induced
fluorescence) [104,105] and PIV (particle image velocimetry) optical
diagnostic measurements on a single cavity TVC [66]. It was found
[66] that the fuel-air mixing in the cavity is enhanced as the momen-
tum flux ratio (MFR) is decreased as shown in Fig. 21(a) and (c). This
is most likely due to a favorable vortex being formed in the cavity.
Comparing the scalar dissipation rates of mixture fraction with the
vorticity contours revealed that a good agreement was obtained as
shown in Fig. 21(b) and (d). The regions of the maximum mixing are

Pobserved to be along the fuel-air interface. Reacting flow PIV meas-
urements showed that the vortex was displaced from the center of
the cavity towards the guide vane. In general, the detailed measure-
ments showed interesting features of the flow including the pres-
ence of a dual cavity structure. A better understanding of the
underlying physics of the cavity flow was obtained to highlight the
importance of the fuel-air momentum ratio parameter as shown in
Fig. 21.

PEntrainment of the main flow into the cavity was found to be a
minimum in the absence of air or fuel jets, as a large, stable vortex is
trapped within the cavity with an optimal width-to-depth ratio. This
is confirmed by direct numerical simulations (DNS) [62] of reacting
and non-reacting flows over a cavity. When air was directly injected
into the cavity to drive the flow, stabilizing the vortex needs to be
achieved by a larger cavity width-to-depth ratio. Similar findings
were obtained for reacting flow cases [35,36]. Indirect measure-
ments of the entrainment of cross-flow into the cavity of a subsonic
TVC revealed that the entrainment of air into or out of the cavity
was determined indirectly from CO emissions and LBO (lean blow-
out) measurements. For high momentum ratios (i.e. ratio of cavity
momentum to mainstream momentum (cid:3)1) a maximum entrain-
ment (i.e. »40%) was observed for a cavity length to depth ratio
equal to 0.55. However,
for low momentum ratios, minimum
entrainment of the main flow into the cavity (i.e. »4%) was observed
for the cavity length to depth ratios of 0.55(cid:1)0.90.

PDirect measurements of mixing and mass transport in a TVC are
typically conducted by using PLIF [106(cid:1)108]. The acetone PLIF
measurements [109] was performed to quantify mixing in non-
reacting flows, where the gas phase composition was within the
flammability limits. Similar PLIF measurements [110] were applied
to study scalar dissipation rates in turbulent opposed flows and jets.
How to achieve good mixing between the cavity products and the
mainstream flow is a major challenge for TVC design. A passive mix-
ing enhancement approach was proposed in Ref. [32]. Inclined struts
along with a flow guide wave as shown in Fig. 22(a) were designed
and tested on a TVC operated at an atmospheric pressure condition.
The measured flame images are shown in Fig. 22(b)-(e). Excellent
mixing is found. And a small flame length, low pressure drop (in the
range of 0.35), and low NOx emission (1(cid:1)3 ppm) are achieved. The
flame stability is excellent, and combustion efficiency is reasonable
in the range of 96%. The mixing improvement is due to a counter-
clockwise cavity vortex resulting from the flow guide vane. The vor-
tex is conductive to the mixing with the mainstream flow due to the
rise of cavity combustion products along the inclined struts.

POne of the common fuel injection schemes applied in supersonic
combustors is to inject fuels upstream from the wall of the cavity
flame-holder [23]. Furthermore, shock waves are generated at
supersonic or hypersonic flight conditions, which affect the flow
field around the cavity and the behavior of the shear layer over the
cavity. The effects of shockwaves on fuel-air mixing and combustion
dynamics in the supersonic cavity flame holder (Ma = 3) are numeri-
cally and experimentally studied [111]. A shock wave impinging
near the fuel injection leads to the shear layer into the cavity flow
and may quench combustion in the wake of the fuel jet due to the
increased fuel concentration within the cavity. However, a shock
wave impinging over the cavity gives rise to greatly enhanced mix-
ing and stronger combustion in the cavity. This is due to the shear
layer being lifted until interacting with the incident shock wave and
reattaching at the rear section of the cavity.

3.3. Emissions and combustion of alternative fuels

PAnother attractive feature of TVC is that different types of fuels
such as syngas and methane in either liquid and gas phase can be
applied [112]. For conventional combustion systems, it is difficult to
burn syngas, because of its varying compositions and considerably

Palternative fuels such as hydrogen and synthetic gas (syngas).
The flame temperature, the flow field, and species concentrations
inside the TVC were obtained as shown in Fig. 23(b)(cid:1)(d). Hydro-
gen enriched hydrocarbon fuels combustion (see Fig. 23(b)) was
shown to produce more energy, a higher temperature (14%
increase when methane is replaced with methane/hydrogen mix-
ture with 75% hydrogen fraction). The NOx emission is increased,
as the fraction of hydrogen is increased for methane/hydrogen
fuel mixture (see Fig. 23(d)). The flame for methane combustion
(see Fig. 23(c)) was found in the primary vortex region. However
it was shifted to the secondary vortex region for hydrogen
combustion.

POH species concentration in a cavity of a TVC burning syngas was
measured by using PLIF. Comparison is then performed between
Syngas and methane in terms of mixing and flame stabilization
[113,114], as shown in Fig. 24(a) and (b) respectively. The momen-
tum flux ratio (MFR) is found to be a critical parameter governing
the combustion process and the mixture formation. At high MFR, the
combustion is restricted to a mixing layer flame at the interface of
the fuel and air in the cavity like in a jet diffusion flame. The syngas
addition in the mainstream does not change the MFR dramatically in
the cavity. Thus the flame location and extent look quite similar.
This indicates that the combustor can be operated stably in the
absence of syngas addition in the mainstream, and all fuel can be
injected into the cavity. For methane, the mechanism of mixing is
different from that of syngas due to the much lower MFRs. And the
flame stabilization mechanism (see Fig. 24(c) and (d)) is different
from that of syngas. The methane and syngas combustion in the TVC
with the flow guide vane are found to be different in terms of the
flow structure, flame location and fuel-air mixing patterns. However,
these phenomena are shown to be dominated by the MFR and the
local cavity equivalence ratio.

PIn addition to the premixed and non-premixed combustion
modes as discuss above, TVC can also be operated in the rich-burn,

3.4. Aeroacoustics characteristics

PWhen air stream flows over cavities,

intense self-sustained
acoustic oscillations may occur under certain conditions [101]. If the
oscillations are coupled with the resonance of the engine structure,
this may result in a catastrophic failure [115]. Cavity is assumed to
be open, when reattachment occurs near the cavity's trailing edge.
However, when the reattachment point is located on the cavity's
bottom, it is considered to be closed. For the closed cavities, acoustic
fluctuations are associated with a broadband frequency spectrum.
However, open cavities selectively amplify a number of acoustic
tones, as typically found in cavity combustors. Those acoustic tones
may be generated as normal resonance phenomena or an acoustic
feedback loop. Normal resonance occurs, when the free stream
Mach number is below 0.2 [116]. The open- or closed-cavity flow
characteristics were shown to be altered by imposing micro-jet air
flow [117].

PWhen high Mach number air flows over a cavity, the acoustic
feedback mechanism [118] is schematically illustrated in Fig. 25. The
faster grazing flow passing over the slower recirculation in the cavity
gives rise to Kelvin-Helmholtz oscillations in the shear layer. The
shear layer then leads to vortices. Instability is created by the inter-
action of the shear layer and unsteadiness in the cavity [119]. The
phishing shear layer is pulsed arrives at the trailing edge of the cav-
ity. This implies the development of a region of high pressure next
to another low pressure, which leads to an acoustic dipole. The radi-
ated acoustic waves propagating upstream disturb the shear layer at
the leading edge of the cavity. This in turn causes additional vortex
shedding. The feedback loop resulting from vortex-acoustics interac-
tion may selectively amplify a dominant frequency [118].

PA formula to predict the acoustic resonant frequency was pro-
posed about 50 years ago [120]. The empirical constants involved in
the formula need to be modified, if an influence of an opposing wall
is considered. Recently, unsteady RANS simulations were conducted
[119] to improve the formula proposed in Ref. [120]. This was done
by replacing the empirical constant (vortex velocity to the free
stream velocity) by vortex velocities extracted from numerical
results. The equation provides reasonable estimates of the acoustic
resonant frequencies, which agree well with the experimental

Pmeasurements, especially at high Mach numbers [30]. To study
unsteady reacting cavity flow in a TVC, KIVA-3 V [65], a numerical
tool was applied. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier(cid:1)Stokes equa-
tions were solved with k-e turbulence model and a modified eddy
dissipation concept. It was found [65] that the cavity depth mode
acoustic resonances are predominant over the shear layer resonan-
ces [120] in the expected combustor-operating range. This implies
that resonant frequencies do not depend on the flow velocity or cav-
ity length, but depend on the cavity depth. The cavity air and fuel
injection seems to have no effect on the resonant frequencies. This
further confirms the depth-mode resonance. Acoustic power is
found to increase with the cavity injection. An extended literature
review [121] was performed to summarize some recent advances in
simulations, modeling, and control of flow/acoustics resonances in

Pflows over open cavities. Flow-excited acoustic resonance in deep
cavity was analytically modeled [122]. Experimentally measured
values were used for the vortex convection velocity and phase to cal-
culate the amplitude of the oscillation and frequency ratio. It was
concluded that the model provides good predictions. Flow-excited
acoustic resonance in a shallow cavity was also studied [123]. It was
demonstrated that there was a significant change in the acoustic
feedback mechanism and amplification of the induced fluctuations
by the pressure of the closed cavity.

PAeroacoustics signature of a combusting/reacting TVC was exper-
imentally measured [124], as shown in Fig. 26. The measurements as
shown in Fig. 26(a) and (b) indicate that the OASPL (overall sound
pressure level) is increased with the primary air velocity and cavity
equivalence ratio (Kc).

4. Derived concepts of trapped vortex combustor

PNext-generation gas turbine engines [125(cid:1)127] are expected to
perform better than conventional engines [85,102] in many aspects.
For example, advanced/future combustors are much shorter and uti-
lize non-metallic materials to meet the demand of required thrust-
to-weight ratio. The compact combustors are associated with a
higher temperature gradient [39], a shorter residence time [23],
which is beneficial
in reducing the NOx emissions. However,
unburned hydrogen-carbon (UHC) and CO emissions may increase
due to inadequate reaction time. In addition, the partially-reacted
fuel could escape the shorter combustion chamber. And the mixture
may continue to burn in the turbine stages, which could pose a series
of rotating component challenges such as not rotating vane and
blade durability, and increased pressure loss. To meet the conflicting
challenges and requirements, trapped vortex combustion concept
can be modified and applied.

4.1. Ultra-compact cavity combustor

POne configuration of a more aggressive trapped vortex combus-
tor designs is known as ultra-compact combustor (UCC) [128,129].
This novel design of UCC is to meet the challenges of improved
engine durability, higher peak temperatures, higher compression
ratio, and reduced weight with lower emissions. Intensive research
and development on UCC are underway [130,131]. There are two
main objectives: (1) how to achieve effective stabilization of the pri-
mary reaction zone in the circumferential cavity, (2) how to effec-
tively migrate the primary zone products back into the core to
present flow to the high-pressure turbine consistent with traditional
combustor design. To achieve those objectives, two different config-
urations of ultra-compact combustors have proposed as shown
Fig. 27(a) and (b) respectively.

PThe first configuration is TVC-based UCC design (see Fig. 27(a)). It
is axisymmetric and involves sustaining cavity rotation in the same
plane as the core flow. The cavity vortex is stabilized in the presence
of opposing jets of air and fuel [133,134]. Its size is such that migra-
tion from the cavity occurs smoothly in the absence of additional
entrainments from the upstream core. The second configuration is
also known as high-g combustor, as shown in Fig. 27(b). Air is
injected into the circumferential cavity with a tangential compo-
nent. Thus a second regime of bulk fluid movement is induced
around the engine centerline. The exhaust emissions and tempera-
ture from such high-g combustor at varying operating conditions are
quantified and measured [135]. Experimental study of a high g-
loaded combustion system has been successfully conducted in Ref.
[130]. The experimental results confirm that this type of high-g

Ploaded system has great potential to be used as an ultra-compact
combustor for a main burner, or as an inter-turbine burner (ITB)
[136,137].

PTo compare the UCC design as shown in Fig. 28(b), a segment of a
conventional annular combustor is illustrated in Fig. 28(a). Air enters
the combustion chamber through dome swirlers and liner holes. The
air is used for mixing and cooling. In the conventional design, the
residence time in the combustor depends on its axial length. Thus
the engine should be long enough to achieve complete combustion.
The fuel-air mixture is burned, and then exits the combustor. The
hot combustion product is then convected to turbine inlet guide
vanes. The vanes redirect the flow at the correct angle at the high
pressure turbine rotor. In a typical engine system, the air exiting the
compressor is decelerated and de-swirled, before entering the com-
bustion system plenum. The air is then locally re-swirled in the com-
bustor to improve mixing and flame stabilization. Then the flow is
turned once again and accelerated before entering the turbine. Each
of these processes takes place in the engine axial direction. However,
in the UCC design/concept, a cavity runs around the outer circumfer-
ence of the extended turbine inlet guide vanes [138(cid:1)140], as shown
in Fig. 28(b).

PFuel is injected into this UCC cavity. Beside the cavity, there is a
radial cavity that extends to the inner platform on each vane. The
main objective is to burn rich in the circumferential cavity. This pro-
vides much of the required combustion residence time to take place
in the circumferential direction of the engine, rather than axial as is
designed conventionally. The flow within this cavity is swirled to
produce high-g loading and to enhance fuel-air mixing. Flame stabi-
lization is achieved as hot combustion products are recirculated
inside the cavity. The intermediate combustion products are trans-
ported via wakes into the radial cavities in the vane surfaces. Here
combustion continues at a reduced equivalence ratio, since the
mainstream air is entrained into the wakes. Finally there may be a
minimum blockage flame, where combustion products are entrained
and distributed into the main flow.

PThe main findings obtained from the previous studies [138(cid:1)141]

on the UCC are summarized as:

P1) Excellent lean-blow out (LBO) performance.
P2) Higher combustion efficiencies over a wide operating range.
P3) Higher heat release rate in comparison with conventional com-

bustors by up to 200%.

P4) Stable, efficient operation at 200(cid:1)300% higher loading than for

conventional combustors.

P5) The radial-vane cavity effectively transports the mixture form

the cavity to the main flow.

P6) Short combustion lengths in comparison with conventional

combustors operating at similar conditions.

P7) Pressure effects enable the combustion efficiency being
improved for a given configuration. However, it has little impact
on the lean-blowout (LBO) performance.

P8) The unreacted mixture transport into the main airflow is a
strong function of air injection and cavity g-loading. Increased
g-loads create a centrifugal effect in the cavity, keeping the
unreacted mixture toward the cavity outside diameter. How-
ever, a limit is reached where flame extinction occurs in the
cavity, due to high velocities that are unable to sustain the
flame. Therefore a window of optimal g-loading seems to be
500(cid:1)3500 g.

PA further development of the UCC concept is denoted by the cav-
ity-inside-cavity (CIC) design [37]. Its main idea is to introduce a sec-
ond cavity, channeled inside the primary one. All fuel needed is
injected through the secondary cavity. Additional air is also injected

Pin the CIC to increase fuel-air mixing and to create a stable vortex
inside the cavity. This is the basic concept of such CIC burner.

4.2. High-g cavity combustor

PHigh-g combustors [142,143] are proposed and designed as an
alternative configuration of UCC due to the potential benefits of
combustion at high-g loading. The flame speeds were found [144] to
increase across a range of g-load from 500 to 3500 g. And the com-
bustion efficiency was increased, as shown in Fig. 29(a). To explain
this behavior, a ‘bubble transport hypotheses’ was developed and
validated [144]. It stated that buoyant bubbles of reacting mixture
were accelerated beyond the local flame front by the increased den-
sity gradients induced by the g-load. The bubble SB (burning veloc-
ity) was further shown to be related to the g-load on the fluid by
SB = 1.25g0.5. Observed flame propagation then progressed at the
greater of either the turbulent flame speed or the bubble velocity.
Recent numerical simulation [145] showed that good agreement

Pflame. Therefore a window of optimal g-loading appears to be
500(cid:1)3500 g's.

P6) Higher g-loads result in efficiency degradation.
P7) Pressure has little effect on the LBO performance but improves

the combustion efficiency for a given configuration.

P8) Future research is needed to better understand proper film-cool-
ing [146] hole geometry and placement of coolant on the hybrid
vane of a high-g combustor. A number of film-geometries are
investigated by Johnson et al [140] such as fan-shaped holes,
laid-back holes, trenches, and ramps.

PIn general, understanding and developing TVC-based ultra-com-
pact [139,141] and high-g combustors are critical for turbine-burner
research and development in that they provide insights about
flame-holding and combustion in high accelerating (radial) flows.

4.3. Inter-turbine burner (ITB)

PWith cavity flame-holding capacity, the continuous-turbine-
burner (CTB) concept was proposed as an augmentative combustor
at UC Irvine [147]. In such burners, combustion continues in the sta-
tor and rotor. Thermodynamic analysis [148] showed that applying
CTB in ground-based engines and aircraft turbojet engines gives rise
to improvement on power/weight and combustion efficiencies. To
avoid complications with burning in a stator or rotor stage, the
inter-turbine-burner (ITB) concept is proposed [148]. CTB can be
assumed to consist of N-stage ITB, as N is infinitely large. There are
various options to choose the combustion chamber. One option is to
take advantage of the transition duct between the low- and high-
pressure turbine stages. Another option is to utilize the turbine sta-
tor (nozzle) passages. However, this option is associated with the
challenge of significant acceleration of the flow in the presence of
mixing and reacting. Another option is to use both the transition
duct and the first stator (turbine nozzle) in the low-pressure turbine.
This enables the combustion processes beginning in the transition
duct but extending into the stators. All these options require com-
bustors to be more compact, i.e. a smaller size, with decreased resi-
dence time.

PTo improve part-power performance of turbine engines, the US.
Department of Defense (DOD) supported 3 projects, aimed to
develop and demonstrate ITB technology on gas turbine engines
[147,148]. One project conducted by Creare, Inc. is to perform cycle
analyses to examine the potential benefit of ITB. Another project
conducted by Spytek Aerospace Corporation is to implement an ITB
to existing engines. Emphasis is placed on how to provide air into
the primary combustion zone of the ITB and to successfully entrain
the combustion products into the main flow. The final project is to
provide detailed ITB designs and their integration into small turbine
engines. This research is conducted jointly by Honeywell Aircraft
Engines and Advanced Products Research, Inc., which has prior expe-
rience with trapped vortex combustors. Preliminary results showed
that implementing ITB can lead to part-power fuel efficiency being
increased by 7 to 17%. These projects demonstrate the growing feasi-
bility of employing ITB to achieve the design of more compact and
efficient engines. However, detailed information of these studies
were not fully documented due to the commercial nature.

P4.3.1. T-s cycle analysis of ITB

PTemperature-entropy cycle analysis is conducted to gain insight
on the ITB and CTB performances. Fig. 31 shows the concept for ITB
(inter-turbine burner). There may be 1, 2, or N such ITB as shown in
Fig. 31(a) and (b). Clearly, as N goes to infinity, the N-ITB cycle
approaches the CTB cycle [148]. In the ideal application of ITB, com-
bustion occurs in both the stator and rotor regimes of each stage.
Temperature remains constant through all stages, while additional
thermal energy balances the rates for energy conversion to kinetic

Pwas obtained. The propagation mechanism was shown to be primar-
ily Rayleigh-Taylor instability with turbulent flame speed and ther-
mal expansion.

PThe high-g combustor as shown in Fig. 30 is designed by using
high swirl in a circumferential cavity to enhance reaction rates via
high cavity g-loading on the order of 3000 g's [126,140]. Increase in
reaction rates indicates that the combustor volume can be dramati-
cally reduced. Experimental results have shown promise of high-g
combustor for future engine applications. Lean blowout (LBO) fuel-
air limits at 25(cid:1)50% the value of current systems were demon-
strated as shown in Fig. 29(b). Combustion efficiency was measured
over a wide range of high-g combustor operating conditions as
shown in Fig. 29(a). The results confirmed the attractive features of
high-g cavity combustion.

PThe previous and on-going researches on high-g cavity-based

combustion systems reveal:

P1) Shorter combustion lengths approximately at 50% of conven-

tional combustors operating at similar conditions.

P2) Excellent LBO performance. The high-g combustor is about
200(cid:1)400% that of conventional combustors while still maintain-
ing the same or lower LBO levels. For some configurations, LBO
does not depend on combustor loading parameter.

P3) A trade exists between the cavity extraction via radial vane cavi-
ties which affect temperature distribution, LBO and combustion
efficiency.

P4) Unreacted mixture transport into the main airflow depends

strongly on air injection and cavity g-loading.

P5) Increased g-loads create a centrifugal effect in the cavity, keep-
ing un-reacted mixture toward the cavity OD (outer diameter).
However, a limit is reached where flame extinction occurs in the
cavity due to high velocities which are unable to sustain the

Penergy and mechanical work. One application of ITB in practice is
that combustion is present between consecutive turbine stages. Fuel
injection and burning between stages leads to a monotonically
increasing temperature in that portion, immediately followed by a
sharp temperature decrease through the turbine stage. The sharp
temperature drop occurs at constant or near constant entropy. This
enables thermal energy being converted to mechanical work in the
turbine stage (nozzle or rotor). Another application of ITB is that the
combustion can occur within the nozzle. Thermal energy is
increased, and part of it is converted to kinetic energy. The tempera-
ture is then decreased dramatically in the downstream region of the
stator and the rotor. Here, thermal energy is again converted to
kinetic one. And the kinetic energy is finally converted to mechanical
work. Any application of ITBs will lead to a more compact engine
with a smaller size and less weight.

PThe performance improvement by implementing ITB in compari-
son with conventional gas turbine engines is clearly confirmed in
Fig. 32. The results are obtained by conducting temperature-entropy
(T-s) cycle analysis [148]. The specific thrust and TSPC (thrust spe-
cific fuel consumption) are dramatically increased.

PIn spite of the attractive features of ITBs, there are many chal-
lenges that need to address the combustion within the turbine stage
and the stator passage. For example (1) how to ignite in a high-accel-
eration flow; (2) how to achieve effective flame-holding in a high-
acceleration flow; (3) how to completely vaporize liquid fuel for
complete mixing and combustion within a short residence time; (4)

Phow to achieve hydrodynamic stability of a stratified flow with a
large turning acceleration; (5) how to meet the increased demands
for rotors and stators cooling; and (6) how to maintain an acceptable
loading of aerodynamic forces on the rotor blades.

P4.3.2. ITB in a turning or converging channel

PThese challenges associated with the development and applica-
tion of ITB in subsonic and supersonic engine systems intrigues
intensive experiment and numerical research. For example, experi-
ments were conducted at UC Irvine [147,148] in a high-speed sub-
sonic combustion rig with optical windows for laser diagnostic
measurement. The photos of the cavity combustion are shown in
Fig. 33(a)(cid:1)(c).

PThe qualitative behaviors for liquid-fuel combustion as shown in
Fig. 33(d) were found to be quite similar to those of gaseous fuel, as
the experimental setup reached thermal equilibrium. The combus-
tion was more vigorous. However, as fuel flow rate is increased dra-
matically, combustion can not be sustained. However, for most of
the conditions described in the operational map, liquid-fuel combus-
tion was achieved. The temperature profile across the cavity is
shown in Fig. 33(e). Details measurements including non-reacting
flow and reacting cases (combustion test) with gaseous and liquid
fuels supplied are available in Refs [140,149]. It is found that (1)
there are two distinct combustion zones; the shear layer and the
cavity. (2) The cavity behaves like a stirred reactor and the shear
layer behaves like a diffusion flame. (3) The mixing time scales

Pdetermine the division of overall combustion between the cavity and
the shear layer. (4) The temperature pattern at the exit shows that
the mixing of burned gases and the main air flow is more efficient in
the shallow-cavity case in comparison with the deep-cavity case.
These findings are confirmed with the numerical studies of cavity-
driven reacting flows.

PThe effect of curvature on flame-anchoring as expected in ITB is
experimentally studied [148,149], as shown in Fig. 33(a). Two test
sections are designed. Both tested sections share the same channel
curvature and contraction characteristics. The cavity dimensions
and axial locations are exactly the same. The only difference of these
two sections was the radial location of the cavity. One test rig had
the cavity on the channel's inner wall of, while the other test rig had
the cavity on the channel's outer wall. The cavity depth is variable to
create deep (5 cm) or shallow (2 cm) cavity. For each setup, two cav-
ity aspect ratios (L/D = 1 and 2.5) were studied. The fuel such as pro-
pane and liquid n-heptane in liquid and gaseous was injected at
different places to find the optimum injection location. The injection
location was found to affect the absolute values of temperatures and
burning efficiency, but the qualitative behavior of the flame-holding
was not affected. Flame blowout investigations [150] were also con-
ducted, as the fuel and air flow rates were varied over a wide range.
This is achieved by keeping the fuel flow rate constant and the air-
flow rate increased from zero to blowout. The blowout tests showed
that the cavity combustion went through 3 distinct regimes as
shown in Fig 33(a)(cid:1)(c). This behavior was found to occur in both
test sections with both shallow and deep-cavity configuration for
gaseous fuels.

PTo analyze flame-anchoring mechanisms, CH* chemilumines-
cence investigation was by conducted via using a charge-coupled-
device sensor on a camera with a narrowband filter 431 § 10 nm. In

Paddition, a high-speed camera was applied to capture flame images.
The bright areas in Fig. 34 denote the areas of combustion. It can be
seen that combustion takes place in both the shear layer and the cav-
ity. It is also found that the flame in the shear layer is anchored at the
cavity's upstream edge. And the shear layer is linearly expanding.
However, the cavity where the combustion occurs is almost uni-
form.

PThe series of experimental studies [147,148] reveal that:

P1) The combustion is associate with a diffusion flame at low Rey-

nolds numbers, when it was confined to the shear layer.

P2) In the presence of a combustion inside the cavity, the measured
temperature profile inside the cavity is almost uniform, except
near the walls. This mimics a well-stirred reactor.

P3) If the equivalence ratio of the fuel-air mixture was within the
flammability limit, combustion occurred. It was initiated by the
strong heat transferred from the shear layer via convection and
radiation.

P4) When Reynolds numbers is large, the percentage of combustion
in the shear layer is decreased, while the percentage of cavity
combustion is increased. This is confirmed by the change in rela-
tive intensities of the cavity combustion and the shear layer as
shown in the narrowband-filtered images.

PTo simulate the experiments, numerical simulations are per-
formed on high-speed, accelerating and turbulent turning flows of

Pturning and converging channel [151,152]. The aim is to better
understand the effects of turning flow, streamwise acceleration and
a cavity on mixing, and the effects of fuel injection into the cavity on
flame holding and fuel-air mixing. Fig. 35 shows the density and
reaction-rate contours for the converging and turning cases.

PHigh-reaction-rate is found to be much smaller in the turning/
converging channel than the non-converging/turning channel. The
high reaction rate region is downstream of the cavity. Finally, the
less than 1% stagnation pressure losses confirm the merits of the ITB
concept. The experimental and numerical results reveal that Kelvin-
Helmholtz instability is always present in any channel-cavity flow.
The centrifugal instability is related to Rayleigh's circulation crite-
rion for stability: Rayleigh-Taylor instability is found to be present
only in the curved channel configurations. Here gravitational forces

Pcan be neglected. Since the combustion products are less dense but
the fuel is denser than the flowing air in the channel, it is difficult to
predict whether the Rayleigh-Taylor instability will be destabilizing
or stabilizing. The density in the cavity is shown to be affected by
the fuel injection configuration. As parallel injection is adopted,
high-density fluid is injected at the cavity's upstream wall. And low-
density combustion products fill most of the cavity. This makes the
case with the cavity on the outside more susceptible to Rayleigh-
Taylor instabilities.

with possibly reduced combustion emissions, a so-called in-situ

Phas great potential to be applied in gas turbine engines for generat-
ing very low combustion noise, a uniform temperature distribution
and negligibly small emission of NOx and CO. The latter adopts the
concept of stabilizing combustion in a small volume and at high flow
rates. Thus FTVCRC can deliver multiple benefits, including environ-
mental, economic and operational advantages. The main features of
FTVCRC include higher efficiency, lower chemical and acoustic emis-
sions, more reliable operation and extended life time of mechanical
components [102,103].

PFlameless combustion phenomenon was first observed in Ref.
[155] from the experimental tests with a self-recuperative burner. It
was shown that (1) the combustion was stable and very quiet; (2) no
UV-signal, no UHC and NO could be detected; (3) CO emission was
below 1 ppm; (4) no flame could be observed. These features charac-
terize such flameless combustion, which is a new technology. It
forms nearly invisible flames with a uniformly distributed combus-
tion and temperature, producing very low combustion noise. It is
also known as flameless oxidation [155], high temperature air com-
bustion [156,157], moderate and intense low oxygen dilution
(MILD) combustion [158,159] and heat recirculating combustion
[156]. Following the previous study [155], extensive researches on
flameless combustion were then conducted. To generate flameless
combustion, low amount of fuel needs to react with a very high tem-
perature oxidizer with intensified turbulence for rapid mixing. It is
found that the high air temperature is effective on increasing the
burning rate [157], thus allowing self-ignition. High temperature air
combustion is found to reduce combustion noise, improve thermal
field uniformity and flame stability, and generate lower peak tem-
perature and smaller temperature gradients relative to air-diluted
combustion.

PApplication of such a flameless combustion (FC) concept in
furnaces was attempted. The successful application
industrial
encourages FC applications in other fields, such as land-based
gas turbine engines for power generation. Flamme [160] worked
on an EC funded project to develop FC burner technology, which
can be operated under gas turbine conditions. It was found that
at atmospheric conditions with a pressure loss less than 5%, both
the acoustic and pollutant emissions levels from multiple FC
burners are extremely low. Based on the previous numerical and
experimental studies, it was proposed that there were 2 main
requirements for generating flameless mode in gas turbine
engines [102,103]. One is that the local turbulence should be
intensified enough to achieve distributed reaction, i.e. the eddies
are smaller than the reacting layer. The second is that after mix-
ing with the exhaust gases, the mixture ignites before leaving
i.e. the ignition time delay of the mixture is
the combustor,
shorter than residence time.

PFTVRB involves the advantages of enhanced stability and reliabil-
ity, low combustion noise, low emissions, uniform temperature dis-
tribution, improved pattern factor, and high efficiency. However,
one of the main drawbacks of FTVRB is that it is found to be more
susceptible to combustion instability. The experimental
tests
revealed that the cavity pilot flame was more susceptible to the
onset of combustion-driven oscillations [3, 9-11] in pressure and
heat release at certain operating conditions, as shown in Fig. 38. For
a swirl ratio with high oscillation amplitudes, modal analysis con-
firmed that the combustion system is linearly unstable. To suppress
such combustion instability, a phase-shift controller can be applied
[102,103].

5. Various industry applications

PIn recent years, cavity flame holders as an integrated fuel injec-
tion/flame-holding approach have been proposed as a promising
concept for flame-holding and stabilization in various industries
such as power generation and waste incineration and aerospace.

Preheat combustor (fuel injection via airfoil injection) was proposed
and developed by Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation [153].
The main objective is to develop a gas reheat concept applicable for
gas turbines, in which fuel is added via one or more stages of blades
and vanes. The fundamental idea is to inject enough fuel at the vane
trailing edge to increase the temperature of the working medium.
This kind of combustor has a similar application as ITB (inter-turbine
burner). The ITB concept can be considered partly as a reheat strat-
egy. However, an in-situ reheat burner is fully integrated into the
flow configuration. The in-situ reheat process is similar to the
sequential combustion reheat. In in-situ reheat combustor [154],
fuel is injected through the high-pressure turbine stage airfoils
instead of reheat combustor baskets, with reheat-combustion pro-
ceeding in the wakes of the airfoils. The reheat combustor basket
applied with sequential combustion reheat is replaced by an ‘in-situ
combustor’ representing the flow path between the blade and the
vane. A schematic comparison of the turbine layouts with sequential
combustion reheat and with in-situ reheat is shown in Fig. 36. It is
conceptualized that the in-situ reheat combustor may be lower in
cost, more compact and have a lower pressure drop than the sequen-
tial combustion reheat combustor. The in-situ combustors achieving
low NOx emissions have been conceived. However, they are still
under development and tests. Numerical simulations were setup to
estimate the performance of the in situ reheat cycles at turbine off-
design conditions

4.5. Flameless TVC reheat combustor

PAs a valuable and promising candidate for a next-generation gas
turbine engine combustion system, a flameless TVC Reheat Combus-
tor (FTVCRC) [102,103] as shown in Fig. 37(a) and (b) is proposed
and tested. FTVCRC combines the two recently developed combus-
tion concepts: (1) the flameless combustion and (2) the trapped vor-
tex combustion, as shown in Fig. 37(d)(cid:1)(e). The former provides a
promising combustion technology, flameless oxidation. Implement-
ing the flameless combustion concept in furnaces indicates that it

5.1. Aerospace application

POne of the practical applications of trapped vortex combustion
concept is to design a cavity flame holder to power a propulsion sys-
tem in Aerospace industry. These propulsion systems include ram-
jets and scramjets and aero-engines.

P5.1.1. Ramjets

PRamjets [78,84] are typically referred to a group of air-breathing
jet engine that uses the engine's forward motion to compress incom-
ing air without an axial compressor. They are different from super-
sonic combustion ramjets (scramjets). As the engines are moving
forward, incoming air entering the engine inlet is compressed, then
mixed with the fuel and burned in the combustor. Unlike conven-
tional combustors implemented in gas turbine engines where a swirl
stabilizer is applied to provide circulation zones by utilizing swirling
flow, ramjets take advantage of flame holders such as bluff bodies
[161] or sudden expansions, as shown in Fig. 39. These geometric
structures can create recirculation zones with relatively low flow
speeds for fuel-air mixing and flame stabilization [162].

PThe design of backward facing step or sudden expansion for
flame stabilization is widely applied in solid fuel ramjets due to its
simplicity for solid fuel grain assembly. The sudden change of cross-
sectional area enables the recirculation zones being formed down-
stream the step, where the fuel-air mixing and stable combustion

Pcould occur. Using bluff bodies for flame stabilization in ramjets was
well reviewed in Ref. [162]. The effects of various parameters in the
design of bluff bodies and flow conditions on stabilizing flame, such
as the bluff body's configurations, pressure, temperature, and the
fuel-air mixture composition were discussed. Experimental study
was conducted to shed lights on the flame-stabilizing performance
of applying baffles in high-speed flow streams [163]. The effects of
the baffle shapes and diameters, the flow speed, pressure, and tem-
perature were examined. It is shown that a higher inlet temperature
helps widening the limit of burning. However, the inlet pressure has
little effect on the stability range. It is also found that large bluff bod-
ies applied in ramjet combustors are more effective on stabilizing
the flame at high-speed flows. However, these larger flame holders
have a larger blockage ratio and associated with larger drag and total
pressure loss than the small bluff bodies. In 1980s, the barchan dune
(BD) vortex flame holder was proposed [164]. Compared with con-
ventional V-gutter flame holders, the BD-type ones can dramatically
reduce drag and increase the flame stability limit. However, the
main challenge in applying BD-type flame holder is how to maintain
the complicated curve configurations in extremely hot temperature
environments, since the performance of the flame holder depends
strongly on its geometry.

PAnother design for effective flame-holding in ramjets is trapped
vortex combustion. The main idea is to take advantage of well-
designed cavity flame-holder to create a recirculation zone. In the

Pcavities, hot combustion products act as a continuous ignition source
to achieve stable combustion. The use of such well-design cavities to
stabilize and enhance combustion in mini-ramjets was studied for
non-reacting and reacting flows [78,84] as shown schematically in
Fig. 40.

PNon-reacting flow simulations were conducted to gain insight on
cold flow fuel-air mixing performance and identifying a proper pro-
pane (C3H8) injection strategy. Several different propane injection
schemes were evaluated and compared. Four injection locations as
summarized in Table 1 were tested. Except the last case the fuel is

Padded in the cavity's upstream, the other three fuel-injection
schemes (Cases 1 - 3) are associated with the propane being injected
into the cavity directly at different locations.

PSimulation results of these 4 cases are shown in Fig. 41. It can be
seen from Fig. 41(a) that the trapped cavity vortex is not enhanced
but destroyed by the fuel injection, as indicated by the streamlines.
Some propane mixes with the incoming air flow in a thin layer at the
cavity opening and spills out. Part of the propane is transported to
the cavity bottom. Fig. 41(b) shows that as the propane is added
from the after-body's top (corresponding to Case 2), there is still a

Ptrapped vortex. However, it is compressed to be smaller by the pro-
pane stream. Fig. 41(c) shows the results of case 3, as the propane is
added from the after-body's bottom. Since the fuel injection direc-
tion follows the trapped vortex's rotating direction, the strength of
the cavity vortex is reinforced and enhanced. However, it can be
seen that for the first three cases the equivalence ratio > 3.0 is pres-
ent in the cavity and it is too rich to lead to combustion. Fig. 41(d)
illustrates the simulation results, as the propane is added to the
upstream main flow. It can be seen that the cavity vortex is still
trapped in the cavity well. Furthermore, the equivalence ratios in
the cavity are approximately 1.0 in comparison with 3.0 in the for-
mer cases.

PGood fuel-air mixing performance is achieved as revealed in
Fig. 41(d). This is due to the following facts. One fact is that the pro-
pane injection is “early” (further upstream). Another fact is that the
contact surface area between the propane and air in the upstream
injection is much greater than for the other 3 configurations. When
the propane is added into the cavity directly, the contact surface of
the air and propane is confined in the shear layer at the cavity open-
ing. Thus, the propane can only slip out of the cavity via following
the velocity tangential to the main air flow stream. However, the
propane can penetrate into and interact with the main flow stream,
and thus expands much more contact surface with the air, as it is
added perpendicularly to the main air flow. This dramatically pro-
motes the micro-mixing by manipulated macro-mixing. The final
fact is that the flow structure of the propane jet is normal to the
main air flow [165(cid:1)167]. This also helps the fuel-air mixing process.

PThe counter-rotating vortex pair continuously rolls the surrounding
air into the core of the propane jet. And the wake vortices and horse-
shoe vortex also increase the mixing rate. The best injection angle is
found to be 90°, which is based on the optimum momentum flux.
However, when the momentum flux ratio changes, the best angle
needs to be further studied.

PAngled fuel

injection facilitates to enhance fuel-air mixing
and decrease pressure loss. This injection scheme has been stud-
ied extensively in the scramjet community [48,94,98], as it gen-
erates a weaker shock, in comparison with normal fuel injections
in supersonic flows. The injection angle effect was studied
numerically [78] on the same miniature Ramjet as shown in
Fig. 40 by choosing 3 injection angles (90°, 60°, and 30°), while
maintaining the momentum flux ratio to be 1.09. Fig. 42(a)
shows the combustion efficiency, as the injection angle is varied.
It can be seen that injecting the propane at 90° leads to an
increased combustion efficiency. However, there is a small differ-
ence at the combustor exit. As the injection angle is decreased,
the fuel penetration depth is decreased so that the fuel stream is
closer to the center-body. It is worth noting that since the analy-
sis [78,84] is based on the optimum momentum flux of 1.09, the
best injection angle of 90° is identified. However, this best angle
may not be applicable to other TVC designs with a different fuel-
air momentum flux ratio. For example,
for a ramjet with a
choked fuel nozzle, the optimum angle will not be 90° and needs
to be optimized to provide best combustion performance. To
shed lights on the effect of upstream injection location, 3

Pdifferent injections with the same momentum flux ratio were
examined as shown in Fig. 42(b) in terms of the combustion effi-
ciency. If the propane is injected “early”, then it has more time
to mix, burn and thus slightly higher combustion efficiency.

PHowever, the combustion efficiency difference at the combustor
exit is almost negligible.
In comparison with the combustor
length, the small changes of the injector location has little
impact on the overall combustor performance.

Pthe effects of Coriolis force and eddy diffusivity, in comparison with
1000(cid:1)1500 J/kg of the non-spinning combustor. The kinetic energy
in the spinning cavity as shown in Fig. 44(b) is confined within the
cavity opening. It is the primary vortex produced by the entrainment
of the main air flow. However, the kinetic energy in the non-
spinning combustor is transported to the cavity's bottom along the
locked vortex.

PThe spinning motion effect on trapped vortex combustion tem-
perature is shown in Fig. 45. It can be observed that there is a cavity
pilot flame with a maximum temperature of 2400 K in both spinning
and non-spinning combustion chambers. Furthermore, the maxi-
mum temperature zone in the spinning combustion chamber is
slightly downstream, while it occurs in the non-spinning combus-
tion chamber just located behind the after-body.

PCloser observation on the temperature contour of the non-spin-
ning combustion chamber as shown in Fig. 45(a) reveals that the
entire main combustion chamber is filled with hot combustion prod-
ucts, and even in the region close to the combustion chamber casing.
However, in the spinning combustor as shown in Fig. 45(b), the hot
flow region in the main combustion chamber is concentrated more
to the axis. Furthermore, the temperature close to the spinning com-
bustion chamber casing is not as high as the non-spinning one. This
is due to the density change resulting from combustion. The density
change in the spinning motion introduces another type of a second-
ary flow resulting from centrifugal forces. When a fluid element in
the spinning flow is considered, its density is suddenly decreased
because of heat release. The centrifugal force exerted on the fluid
element is less than the radial pressure gradient as mathematically
described as r u2
dr. Thus, the fluid element will be pushed to a
new balanced position towards the combustor center line where the
centrifugal force equals to the pressure gradient.

P5.1.2. Scramjets

PFor supersonic air-breathing engines, the time available for fuel
addition, fuel-air mixing and combustion are very short, of the order
of 1 ms. Therefore flame stabilization [24,90] plays an important role
in the development of scramjets. Conventionally, there are 3 techni-
ques for flame-holding in supersonic flows: (1) creating a recircula-
tion region where the fuel and air can be mixed partially at
relatively low velocities, (2) interaction between partially or fully
mixed fuel and oxidizer and a shock wave, and (3) forming coherent
structures containing unmixed fuel and oxidizer, where a diffusion
flame occurs, as the mixtures are convected downstream. These tra-
ditional techniques can be implemented in a supersonic combustor
in 3 different configurations, as shown schematically in Fig. 46.

frame: 0 rpm combusting flow and (b) 30,000 rpm combusting flow [84]. Courtesy of
Dr. S. Chen.

PThe effect of spinning motion [78,84] on the fuel injection effect
and mixing characteristics was numerically studied in the miniature
ramjet, as shown in Fig 40. 3D stream trajectories when propane-
burned combustion occurs are viewed in the rotating reference
frame as plotted in Fig. 43. In the absence of spinning motion, the
propane stream goes straightly through the combustion chamber
(see Fig. 43(a)). However, the presence of spinning motion leads
!
to the fuel stream being bent due to Coriolis force,(cid:1)2
ur (see
Fig. 43(b)).

PTo shed insights on the effect of the spinning motion on fuel-air
mixing, the distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy are illus-
trated in Fig. 44. When the TVC combustor is associated with spin-
ning motion as shown in Fig. 44(b), the level of turbulent kinetic
energy is dramatically increased to approximately 2500 J/kg due to

PAs an integrated fuel injection/flame-holding technique, trapped
vortex combustion has been proposed as an alternative promising
concept during the past few decades in Scramjet communities [168].
It is an alternative promising flame-holding scheme, due to the
promising results obtained from flight tests and the feasibility dem-
onstrations in lab-scale supersonic combustor. Currently, there are
two main research directions: 1) trapping a vortex within the cavity
and 2) cavity-actuated mixing enhancement for flame-holding and
stabilization of supersonic combustion. The first application of cavity
flame holders was a joint Russian/French dual-mode scramjet flight
test (hydrogen fueled) [169]. The flame holder was designed by the
Central Institution of Aviation Motors (CIAM) in Moscow. Further
experimental tests [170,171] confirmed that using a cavity after the
ramp injector can lead to significant improvement of the hydrocar-
bon combustion efficiency in a supersonic combustor. Similar flame
stabilization schemes [23,48] have been applied on a solid-fuel

Psupersonic combustor. It was found that self-ignition and sustained
combustion of PMMA (Plexiglas) under supersonic flow conditions
were achievable.

PPrevious works on scramjet TVCs have confirmed the benefits of
upstream fuel injection. The mixing and combustion characteristics
of a supersonic combustor in scramjets were numerically studied
[172], as the fuel is added upstream of a cavity flame-holder. It was
shown that the interaction of the fuel jet with the shear layer at the
cavity opening affects strongly the fuel-air mixing and flame-holding
processes. As the fuel jet flows over the cavity, a “counter-rotating
vortex pair” of the jet in cross-flow rolls up the shear layer. The mass
exchange between the main stream and the cavity is then enhanced.
If a stable flame is locked inside the cavity, the interaction also trans-
ports hot combustion products to the jet and the main stream to
ignite the unburned fuel-oxidizer mixture. A number of previous
investigations [173,174] have also shown that upstream fuel

Pinjection helped to dampen cavity oscillations. This fuel injection
configuration helps to enhance the shear layer growth rate which in
turn promotes to stabilize the cavity vortex [175]. Optimum design
of a cavity flame holder corresponding to the most effective flame-
holding capability with a minimum flow loss can be achieved from
comprehensive studies of the flow-field and or fuel-oxidizer mixing
characteristics of reacting and non-reacting cavities.
Intensive
research efforts related to non-reacting cavities employed in low
and high Mach number air flows are well reviewed and summarized
in Refs. [23,48]. Open questions impacting the effectiveness of using
such cavities as flame holders in supersonic combustion chambers
are discussed in Sect. 3.

P5.1.3. Aero-engines

PThe trapped vortex (TV) combustion concept is also exploited in
the design of next-generation aero-engines to improve altitude
relight, lean-blow-out, and durability while maintaining cost, weight
and combustor exit temperature profile. A new TV annular combus-
tor (TVC) was proposed and designed [25] as shown schematically in
Fig. 47. It takes advantages of driven cavities incorporated into the
combustor liners. The TV combustor being developed is different
from the conventional one in that it uses a rich-quench-lean design
approach. All fuel is introduced into the cavities. Here, the fuel is
evaporated and mixed with a portion of the total air, partially burns
and eventually leaves the cavities. Vortices are trapped in the cavi-
ties by using the main air chutes through the dome to increase the
mixing time, and provide additional air to mix with the partially
burned gases to achieve complete combustion and to quench NOx
formation prior to reaching the combustor exit.

5.2. Power generation

PFor power generation, a lean premixed TV combustor has been
designed and tested in Ref. [17]. The trapped vortex combustor was
fired on methane and tested, as shown in Fig. 48. For comparison,
a simple bluff body combustor was also tested. All tests were

Pperformed at elevated pressures and inlet temperature and at lean
fuel-air ratios, which were representative of power generation gas
turbine engines.

PThe experimental data obtained from the bluff body and TVC
showed that combustion efficiency was above 99.5% as shown in
Fig. 49(a). Furthermore, the TVC efficiency is much higher than
that of the bluff body. Although the wall quenching effects which
are relatively constant for both the bluff body and TVC configura-
tions, the TVC design leads to the CO emissions being reduced by
more than a factor of 10. The reduction in CO emissions results
from the flame holding features involving increased interaction
between the premixed methane and air flow and the hot prod-
ucts of the combustion in the TVC cavity. As shown in Fig. 49(b),
the TVC has made dramatic improvements on the overall emis-
sions characteristics. As reported in Ref. [17], less than 20 ppm
of CO and NOx@15% O2 is achieved over a useful stoichiometric
range, superior to the bluff body performance. Furthermore, the
10 ppm NOx/10 ppm CO threshold is achieved. In summary, the
performance evaluation confirms that the optimized design of
TVC has the great potential for successful integration into a pro-
totype power generation system because of its robustness and
straightforward design.

PTo achieve low emissions over a wide range of fuel types for land-
based stationary gas turbines, a spin-off trapped vortex combustion
approach was proposed and evaluated [58]. It combines the poten-
tial advantages of trapped vortex combustion and a staged rich-
lean-burn (RQL) [176] combustor. Experiments
burn quick-mix,
were conducted at an inlet-air temperature of 644 K and 10 atm
(1013 kPa) pressure condition. The measured CO and NOx levels are
found to be quite low as expected. This finding is consistent with
that obtained in Ref. [44], in which the TVC concept was evaluated
on heave-duty gas turbines. The premixed injection of natural gas
into the TVC at heave-duty gas turbine conditions was tested. As the
cavity residence time is increased, NOx emission is decreased. The
emission performance was measured, as rich zone equivalence ratio
is varied over a range of operating conditions as shown in Fig. 50.

PThe TVC has been confirmed with reduced emissions and high turn-
down with liquid fuels. It could also overcome existing lean pre-
mixed performance constraints.

PDue to the attractive features of the TVCs, Ramjen Power
Systems, Inc. is currently working on commercializing a lean-
premixed methane-fired trapped-vortex combustion system [29].
This TVC is based on locking a vortex structure between the
fore- and aft-bodies of the cavity. Strong interaction between the
hot highly turbulent cavity gas and the cold channel flow is cre-
ated by using flame stabilizing features designed and placed in
the channel flow.

5.3. Waste incineration

PWaste incinerator is simply a combustion system/device, which
is used to burn waste materials [177(cid:1)180]. The incinerator's perfor-
mance depends on (1) its combustion stability and (2) how well the
combustion air and waste material or fuel are mixed and maintained
at high temperature for sufficient time. To achieve good perfor-
mance, the main requirements for designing an effective incinera-
tion system include:

P1) capability to handle varying waste compositions
P2) compliance with increased regulatory/emission requirements
P3) maximum possible combustion efficiency
P4) capability to handle varying flows-waste may be produced con-

tinuously or in batches

P5) efficient

control

equipment

P6) low maintenance costs
P7) capability to maintain combustion performance over long

timescales

P8) reliable start-up essential for a standby incinerator
P9) high availability- if the incinerator unit is unavailable, the pro-
cess plant may require shutting down, thus incurring major
costs.

PThe first trapped vortex incineration may be dated back to 1990s
[178(cid:1)180]. It is derived from a dump combustor with movable
ceramic plugs implemented to create a combustion cavity to trap
vortex, as shown schematically in Fig. 51(a). The combustion process
was found to strongly depend on the aspect ratio of the combustor
and the equivalence ratio. ‘Quiet’ [178] and high-frequency resonant
modes were observed to be associated with vortex pairs locked in
the cavity [179]. However, a low-frequency resonant mode (chug-
ging) was also found in a cavity (see Fig. 51(b)) with a large aspect
ratio and low equivalence ratio. This oscillation mode is not desir-
able to waste incineration, since the recirculation zone in the cavity
is periodically pushed out, which will reduce the residence time.

PThe destruction and removal efficiency can be as low as 90% due
to the periodic destruction of the recirculation zone. The high- and
low-frequency modes result from self-sustained combustion insta-
bility [3,9]. This was confirmed by the 1D acoustic analysis of the
combustion system [179,180]. The acoustically-excited vortex com-
bustor [178,179] was design to destruct liquid and gaseous waste
surrogates. In the incineration application, fluid waste/pyrolysis gas
surrogates are injected into the recirculation zones of the device's
combustion cavity [178,179]. Here the surrogates are trapped for
relatively longer time under high temperature and/or high radical

Pconcentration conditions. This enables the surrogates to be
destroyed to a high degree.

6. Challenges for TVC designs and implementation

PThe main challenges revealed from the foregoing and ongoing
studies of trapped vortex combustion in high- or low Mach number
flows [181(cid:1)183] can be summarized as:

P1) Cavity and its stability: to achieve flame holding [184,185], cavi-
ties with the length-to-depth ratio L/D < 7(cid:1)10 (also known as
open cavities) are good candidates, since they are associated
with reduced drag coefficients in comparison with closed cavi-
ties with L/D > 10(cid:1)13. The dimensions of an open cavity need to
be properly chosen for ignition and flame-holding [186,187]. For
example, the cavity depth needs to be determined according to
the required residence time to initiate ignition, while the cavity
length needs to be designed to provide sufficient volume of radi-
cals to sustain the combustion further downstream [188,189]. In
addition, an unstable cavity can enhance mixing [190(cid:1)192] and
ignition as a result of strong cavity resonant oscillations. How-
ever, this cavity is unlikely to provide a continuous flame-hold-
ing region [193,194], as revealed in previous experimental
studies. To sustain continuous and stable combustor, a stable
cavity is preferred [194,195].

P2) Fuel injection: fuel injection from a jet nozzle upstream or inside
the cavity can dramatically change the characteristics of shear
layer (for example, the thickness and stability of the shear layer).
Thus the cavity flame-holding performance [190,191] is altered.
Previous studies have confirmed that the interaction between
fuel injection and a cavity leads to different oscillation frequen-
cies [183]. One of the important research areas are fuel injection,
especially in supersonic flow conditions. Typically, there are 2
types of injection concepts. One is steady, for example skewing
and/or swirling the fuel jet. The other is unsteady, such as using
small perturbations. One of the typical perturbations is pulsed

Pjets [192]. Little previous work has been conducted on pulsed
injection into supersonic flow.

P3) Residence time and mixing: A number of researchers have con-
firmed the aerodynamic advantages of trapping vortices inside
small aspect ratio cavities (L/D < 1) both as a means of reducing
the drag penalties of cavities and obtaining stable flame holding
in a low-speed combustor. A small aspect ratio cavity may be
adapted to provide a stable and sustained combustion in super-
sonic flows [181,182]. However, the cavity flow residence time
associated with high-speed flows will be smaller than for low-
speed flows. The short residence time might eliminate its flame-
holding capability [196(cid:1)199]. Therefore, the residence time
inside the cavity should be sufficient to initiate the ignition pro-
cess, which can be characterized by Damkohler number (> 1).
For example, to increase the residence time, fuel needs to be
injected within the cavity flame holder to provide auto ignition
and flame holding [200,201]. Otherwise, it was very challenging
to achieve auto-ignition [201] from small dimension injectors in
the Mach 6 flight condition and low combustor pressures of the
design point.

P4) Heat transfer effect of the cavity wall: As high temperature air is
stagnating and locking in the cavity, excessive heat transfer [39]
will occur to the cavity walls. To cool and protect the cavity sur-
face, additional mass from a porous surface can be applied via
transpiration/cooling technique [39(cid:1)42]. This technique can
reduce the pressure losses associated with the shock wave
structure of the cavity. It also decreases the skin-friction losses
on the cavity floor surface. Thus fuel mass bleeding inside the
cavity pressure distribution. In this way, the intensity of the
strong trailing-edge reattachment shock wave can be reduced.
Therefore, an optimized cavity with transpiration/cooling tech-
nique applied needs to be designed to improve the pressure
losses and to reduce the drag penalties.

P5) Innovative materials: For most TVC applications, a primary com-
bustion zone is established in the cavity with quench air intro-
duced form the dome [202,203]. A strong recirculation zone
with allied primary combustion in the cavity along with a high
surface temperature in the transition region is created. The asso-
ciated high thermal gradients causes high stress levels, even
buckling and bending problems. This imposes a serious chal-
lenge to identify an optimal material for combustor cooling
application, which needs to be meet the high thermo-mechani-
cal requirements and survived in the hostile TVC environment.
The material main properties and features should include but
not limited to
Pa) Improved thermal resistance.
Pb) Increased corrosion resistance even in oxidizing environ-

ment.

Pc) Increased durability.
Pd) Increased stiffness, strength and decreased density (light-

weighted).

PResearches on applying SiC-SiC ceramic matrix composite (CMC)
materials [40(cid:1)43] on TVC are ongoing. Preliminary tests confirm
that the CMC material provides dramatic improvement to the ther-
mal capability. However, the stress and thermal gradients are not
well controlled.
Improvement on these materials needs to be
achieved.

P6) Shock wave-jet interaction: In supersonic flight conditions,
shock waves can be generated from a cavity flame holder
[181,182]. These waves enhance the mixing of fuel jets injected
upstream of the cavity. As confirmed by the previous studies
[181,182], the shock waves produced from a stable cavity can be
used to enhance mixing, while an unstable cavity can be used to

Pactuate mixing. The jet will interact with the strong trailing-
edge shock wave of the cavity, as it reaches to the back wall. The
molecular mixing between supersonic air and gaseous fuel is
enhanced by the oblique shock wave-jet interaction through the
vorticity generated due to the baroclinic torque. This will signifi-
cantly increase the spreading rate of the jet and mixing perfor-
mance of the fuel/air, and so lead to increased combustion
efficiency [196(cid:1)200].

P7) Flight conditions and total enthalpy of incoming air: During
hypersonic flight conditions with a high Mach number (Ma > 8),
both the inlet flow speed and the total enthalpy of air entering
the combustor is quite high. In this hypersonic flight regime, the
typical fuel for a cavity flame-holder is hydrogen, because of its
reduced combustion characteristic times. Igniting the hydrogen-
air mixing system by the cavity flame-holder can be achieved by
the high-stagnation temperature radical runway, even without
appreciable heat release. As the flight Mach number is below
Mach 8 but greater than 1 [181,182], applying an effective flame
holder is crucial in the design of stable combustors. In this
supersonic flight regime, a cavity flame holder needs to be
designed to achieve longer flow residence times. This is due to
the fact that the total enthalpies associated with hydrocarbon
fuels (good candidate for supersonic flights) are relatively low
but the ignition delay time is relatively longer. In general, prop-
erly designed cavities can be used in supersonic and hypersonic
propulsion systems [181,182] over a wide range of flow/flight
conditions.

7. Conclusions and future work

PIn this work, we have provided a review of trapped vortex com-
bustors operated in subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows for
flame holding in various engine systems, such as gas turbines, waste
incinerator, ramjet, scramjet et al. Trapped vortex combustors are
designed to produce a lock-in vortex, which is protected from the
main stream flow. The vortex acts as a pilot flame. It also acts as a
continuous ignition source for the main combustor. This is the fun-
damental working principle of trapped vortex combustors (TVCs). In
a TVC, air and fuel injection should be strategically-placed in the for-
ward and rear walls of the cavity to drive the vortex contained. As
the fuel is injected into the cavities, it is quickly mixed and burned
in the stable trapped-vortex flow structure. Here hot combustion
gases are recirculated by the vortex. The characteristic flow field,
aerodynamics, fuel-air mixing, combustion and acoustics features of
the designed cavities are discussed.

PTo determine the optimum designs of the flame-holding cavity in
subsonic and supersonic flow conditions, intensive experimental
and numerical studies were performed to address industry concerns
and to achieve ignition of both liquid and gaseous fuels and to mini-
mize drag penalties. Insightful findings are obtained from both non-
reacting and reacting tests and their interaction with fuel jets in
terms of drag penalties for different cavity geometries, and flow resi-
dence time inside a cavity, which is crucial to initiate the ignition.
The feasibility of applying TVC concept in industries has been dem-
onstrated in practical gas turbine combustors operated with a realis-
tic inlet temperature and pressure condition by burning different
types and phases of fuel. Foregoing and ongoing studies on the TVC
have confirmed that the TVCs offer significant improvements in LBO
and altitude relight, in comparison with conventional swirl stabi-
lized combustors. They can also offer a wider operating range as
well as a great potential to operate efficiently with high inlet veloci-
ties. TVCs can be applied in a rich-burn, quick-quench, lean-burn
(RQL) system to reduce NOx emission, which involves burning low-
cost fuels containing fuel-bound nitrogen. The TVCs can be operated
in RQL mode as well as a staged, main/pilot mode. The following

PPromising results have been obtained to date from both laborato-
ries and real combustion tests. However, it is worth noting that the
TVC technology is still in the stage of application and commercializa-
tion for subsonic engines and a stage of development for supersonic
and hypersonic propulsion systems. The key challenges which need
to be addressed for the development and application of flame-hold-
ing cavities for industrial combustors include

P1) Optimizing the cavity dimensions and geometry such as differ-
ent wall divergence angles to maximize the residence time,
especially with a given inlet stagnation pressure and tempera-
ture at supersonic or hypersonic flight conditions.

P2) Optimizing the fuel and air injection locations and distributions
to achieve the optimum combustion dynamics and emission
performance.

PCommercial designs and practical issues associated with cost,
weight, and life have not been addressed in any detail in this work.
Follow-up programs are needed to further develop the capabilities
of the TVC (trapped vortex combustion) and address these chal-
lenges and issues. The future research topics on TVC include but not
limited to
