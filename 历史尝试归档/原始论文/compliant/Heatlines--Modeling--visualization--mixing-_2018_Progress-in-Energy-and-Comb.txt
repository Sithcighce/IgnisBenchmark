The bulk motion of fluid and diffusive transport within fluid are two processes during natural or forced con-
vection. The complexity of the convective heat flow is realized since last few decades and the analysis of the
heat flow as well as thermal characteristics gradually becomes cumbersome. Although earlier researchers
studied convective heat flow via velocity profiles, streamlines and isotherms, these tools were not enough
for the efficient visualization of the unique features of convection heat flow. An efficient tool, termed as
‘heatline’ (mathematically represented as heatfunction) was first proposed by Kimura and Bejan in 1983 for
the heat flow visualization during convective heat flow. The aim of this article is to review existing works
on ‘heatline’ involving various physical systems. The mathematical implications of heatfunctions based on
derivations of governing equations and boundary conditions for heatfunctions are presented in detail. The
non-homogeneous boundary conditions for heatfunctions arise due to hot or cold or adiabatic walls as well
as the junction between the walls and these conditions vary with the location of the reference or datum of
the heatfunction. The physics on the heat flow via ‘heatlines’ are found to be invariant with the locations of
the reference value of the heatfunction. The heat flow visualization is analyzed for various test cases from
simple one dimensional boundary layer problem to convection in two dimensional complex cavities. The
detailed explanations of earlier works on ‘heatlines’ during one dimensional flow involving forced or natural
convection with various applications are discussed. Further, applications of ‘heatlines’ during convective
heat flow within enclosed cavities involving uniform or non uniform heating of walls, discrete heating or
cooling, conjugate convection and mixed convection are discussed and ‘heatlines’ are found to be successful
to demonstrate various complex heat flow paths and multiple heat flow circulation cells. Overall, the analy-
sis of convective heat flow from simple to complicated geometries via ‘heatline’ is crucial for the visualiza-
tion of the thermal transport, mixing and efficient thermal management.

1. Introduction

PConvection heat transfer involves the advective transport (bulk
motion of fluid) and diffusive transport (random Brownian motion
of individual particles in fluid). Convection is induced via several
means such as natural, forced, gravitational, thermo-magnetic etc.
Heat transfer by convection plays the pivotal role in various engi-
neering and industrial applications as evident from the review
articles on domestic solar heating [1,2], electrochemical systems [3],
heat exchangers [4], building and ventilation [5], food industries [6],
drying of organic waste materials [7], energy storage [8] and many
more. In addition, convection heat transfer also occurs in several
natural phenomena such as the atmospheric air flow [9], ocean cur-
rents [10] and flow in the earth’s mantle [11]. The thermal manage-
ment and efficient
thermal mixing were found to be major
objectives for various applications as explained by the earlier articles
[12(cid:1)19]. Consequently, this review projects the role of of the con-
vection heat flow on thermal transport leading to the thermal man-
agement for convective systems.

PThe convection heat flow is extremely diverse and that is highly
influenced by a number of parameters such as the fluid properties,
geometry, nature of flow, phases etc. In general, the convection heat
transfer is classified as the external or internal flow (based on the
geometry), natural or forced or mixed convection (based on the driv-
ing mechanism), single or multiple phase (based on the number of

Pphases), laminar or turbulent (based on nature of flow) etc. The field
of convection has been evolved as a sequence from the simple one
dimensional boundary layer problem to convection in two dimen-
sional complex cavities. The prime focus of earlier works for the con-
vective heat transfer analysis was to determine the velocity profiles
and heat transfer coefficients. Further, the problems of convection
gradually became more applied and complicated involving direct
applications in a wide spectrum of industrial and engineering
domains. Thus, the analysis of velocity profiles and heat transfer
coefficients associated with natural convection was not enough and
the efficient visualization tools were required to appreciate the
unique features of convection heat flow. To start with, the tools used
by researchers to understand the heat flow behaviors based on the
isotherms and streamlines associated with various techniques of
flow visualization are discussed below.

PSignificant number of recent works illustrate that, the isotherms
(to visualize temperature distribution) and streamlines (to visualize
fluid flow) are commonly used to study the convective heat transfer
in various systems [20(cid:1)26]. The importance of the visualization of
the physics of energy flow in addition to the temperature distribu-
tion and fluid flow is analyzed in the previous works [20(cid:1)26]. The
‘thermal management’ and ‘efficient processing’ evolved as the key
factors for industrial processing and management of the heat flow in
recent years. Although the fluid flow during convection can be effec-
tively illustrated by streamlines, isotherms cannot represent the

P‘heat flow’ as the isotherms indicate only the spatial distribution of
temperature. The need of a proper tool instead of the standard tech-
niques (isotherms and streamlines) based on the efficient visualiza-
tion of the energy flow during the convection process is highly
desirable. Although Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used for the
fluid flow visualization, the experimental visualization of the heat
flow path is yet to be introduced. It may be noted that, techniques
such as the infrared thermography, thermochromic liquid crystals
(TLCs) etc. provide only the information of the temperature distribu-
tion and it is inadequate to gain thorough knowledge about the heat
flow based on the temperature distribution. A visualization tool may
be important to understand the heat flow during convection. In addi-
tion, the heat flow situation during convection heat transfer is cum-
bersome, involving the conductive and convective heat fluxes.

PA theoretical approach for the heat flow visualization during con-
duction heat transfer is simple as the heat flow is perpendicular to
the isotherms and the visualization is graphically done via ‘heat-
lines’. The heatlines and streamlines are analogous as ‘streamlines’
and ‘heatlines’ represent velocity vectors and energy flux vectors,
respectively [27]. The streamlines and heatlines [27,28] are con-
structed such that the tangent to the streamlines denotes velocity
vectors whereas the tangent to the heatlines denotes energy flux
vectors. The streamlines and heatlines also denote the trajectories of
fluid motion and energy or heat flow, respectively at the steady
state. The direction or path of the heatlines depicts the actual heat
flow as that carries the resultant heat via conduction and bulk
enthalpy flow. During conduction dominant transport, the heatlines
represent the trajectories of the heat flow from the hot to cold
region. On the other hand, the heatlines are qualitatively identical
with the streamlines during the convection dominant heat transfer
especially at the core of the enclosure or away from walls. Overall,
the heat flow path for convective heat transfer is complex as the
heat flux is due to combination of conductive and convective heat
transfer. In addition, the visualization of the heat flow path during
convective heat transfer is not trivial due to the presence of multiple
fluid flow circulation cells with low or high intensities. The investi-
gation of the proper path of the heat flow and intensity of the ther-
mal mixing is highly desirable for the efficient convective heat
transfer mechanism.

PKimura and Bejan [28] first proposed ‘heatlines’, which can
uniquely govern the trajectory of the heat flow [29] in the presence
of natural convection within square cavities. Costa [30,31] also pro-
vided an unified approach for the evaluations of streamlines and
heatlines. Heatlines, which are adequate tools for the visualization,
are mathematically represented by heatfunctions. Similar to stream-
lines and streamfunctions, heatfunctions are obtained for heatlines
such that the heatfunction satisfies the energy balance equation. The
heat flow visualization in the case of convection heat transfer is non-
trivial as the direction of the heat flow is non-orthogonal to the iso-
therms based on the direction and intensity of the convective flow
processes. Although the heatline approach has gained significant
attention for various thermal energy oriented applications in recent
years, ever increasing demand of visualizing the heat flow in various
complex geometries with complex thermal boundary conditions
will support the research community in making use of heatline

Papproach as a primary tool for the analysis of convective heat trans-
fer. The challenges to implement the heatline approach involve to
address various critical issues such as the unique solution of Pois-
son-type heatfunction equation, derivation of
the appropriate
boundary conditions and interpretation of results with the qualita-
tive and quantitative features of heatlines.

PIn the recent past, several numerical studies have been con-
ducted based on the heat flow visualization in various systems via
heatlines. Hence, it is important to consolidate all the existing works
on the heatlines. The current article is the first attempt to outline all
the existing works on the heatline approach involving various physi-
cal systems and establish the uniqueness of heatlines for the visuali-
zation of thermal mixing and management via demonstrating
various case studies involving convective heat transport. Following
Kimura and Bejan [28], the heatline approach was implemented by
various researchers to investigate different types of convection prob-
lem. Thus, each section in this article is further sub-divided into vari-
ous sub-sections to address the implications and challenges of the
heatline approach for the heat flow visualization.

PIn the next section (Section 2), the mathematical background of
the visualization methods is elucidated with the analogy between
the streamfunction and heatfunction. The detailed evaluation on the
heatfunction is analyzed in detail. Various works on the one dimen-
sional flow and the semi-analytical solution procedure are discussed
for convection flows. Further, works on natural convective heat flow
within various cavities are divided based on the thermal boundary
conditions. The implementations of the heatfunction boundary con-
ditions for various thermal boundary conditions are discussed for
various test cases. Subsequently, the mathematical formulations of
heatfunction equations and boundary conditions for special prob-
lems such as convection within discretely heated cavities and conju-
gate convection are addressed for various case studies. The generic
numerical technique via finite element method to solve the heat-
function equations is also discussed. A number of test studies (Sec-
tions 3 and 4) address various practical examples involving the heat
flow patterns and heat transfer rates as explained via the heatlines
for various one dimensional (Section 3) and two dimensional (Sec-
tion 4) geometries. Section 3 is devoted to the heatline studies dur-
ing forced convection boundary layer flows, natural convection
boundary layer flows and mixed convection channel flows. Section 4
presents the detailed discussion on heatline studies during natural
convection in two dimensional enclosures, natural convection in
discretely heated enclosures, conjugate natural convection and
mixed convection in enclosures. A brief review of the works based
on the convection in open cavities involving various physical sys-
tems is presented in Section 4. Section 4 also presents the effects of
the heatfunction boundary conditions on the trends of the heatlines.
Various discrepancies on the heatfunction formulation and the heat-
lines are presented in Section 5. Finally, a summary on ‘heatlines’
approach is presented in Section 6 to address the novelty on founda-
tion, role and impact of the heatlines for the visualization, thermal
mixing and thermal management of physical systems during con-
vective heat flow. Section 6 concludes the review with the overall
perspective of ‘heatlines’.

2. Mathematical background on visualization

PIn general, the solution of the governing equations for convective
flow results in the velocity and temperature components. The 2D
velocity components are used to formulate ‘streamfunction’ based
on the equation of continuity to visualize the fluid flow. The stream-
functions are pictorially represented via ‘streamlines’. The visualiza-
tion of heat transfer during convection associated with 2D velocity
components is pictorially represented via ‘heatlines’, which are
uniquely determined via ‘heatfunctions’. The heatfunctions are
derived based on the steady state energy balance equation.

2.1. Convective heat flow visualization: streamlines vs heatlines

P2.1.1. Streamlines and streamfunctions

PThe streamfunctions (C ) are the mathematical representation of
the streamlines. The streamfunction (C) is obtained from the veloc-
ity components (u and v) in such a way that the continuity equation
for the incompressible fluid (as assumed in the case studies of this
review) is satisfied. The relationships between the velocity compo-
nents (u and v are x and y component velocities, respectively) and
streamfunction (C) in the Cartesian coordinates are [27]

@C

u 1⁄4

and

v 1⁄4 (cid:1)

@C

PThe volumetric flow (dQ) through the control surface through
an element ds of the unity depth can also be given in terms of dC
as follows:

dQ 1⁄4

@C
@x

ð2Þ

Here, C relates physically to the volumetric flow rate and
C D constant indicates the path of the fluid flow based on Eqs. (1a)
and (1b). Thus the streamline (C 1⁄4 constant) has been used as a
visualization and analysis tool for the fluid flow.

PUsing the dimensionless variables, the relationships between the
dimensionless streamfunction (c) and velocity components (U and
V) for two dimensional and incompressible flows are

1⁄4 0. The no-slip condition is valid at the solid
equation,
boundaries as there is no cross flow. Thus, the streamfunction
boundary condition at the walls is c 1⁄4 0 to solve Eq. (4). As inferred
from the above definition of the streamfunction, the positive sign of
c denotes the anticlockwise circulation while the clockwise circula-
tion is represented by the negative sign of c. The second-order par-
tial differential equation (Eq. (4)) is solved using appropriate
mathematical techniques such as the finite difference method [32],
finite volume method [33,34], finite element method [35] to
obtain the distributions of the streamfunction. Based on various
signs (+ or (cid:1)) on the streamfunction maps, the directions of the fluid
flow are studied. The flow separation and multiple fluid circulation
cells are also efficiently visualized via the streamlines.

P2.1.2. Heatlines and heatfunctions

balance equation at the steady state is satisfied. The steady state

The unit normal vectors along the x and y directions are represented
as ex and ey, respectively. The analysis of the conduction heat trans-
fer can be made using only the isotherms, as the heat flux lines can
be easily obtained as the perpendicular lines to the isotherms. Thus,
the heat flux lines or heatlines are the trajectories of the heat flow
during conduction heat transfer. On the other hand, the heat flux
lines are not perpendicular to isotherms ( r h ¢ r T 61⁄4 0) when the
fluid medium is anisotropic or the heat transfer is convection domi-
nant. Thus, in the convective heat flow, the ‘heatlines’ (which are not
the heat flux lines) are used to visualize the heat flow trajectories.
The basic equations for the heatfunction during two dimensional
convective flow are discussed next.
PConvection heat transfer
PDuring convection heat transfer, the direction of the total energy
flux vector (enthalpy advection and heat diffusion) is tangent to
‘heatlines’ [27]. As mentioned earlier, the heatlines in the convection
heat transfer are similar to the heat flux lines employed frequently
in the study of conduction heat transfer. Although the streamlines
adequately represent the fluid flow during convection, and iso-
therms indicate the spatial variations of the temperature in the con-
duction heat transfer, they are inadequate to analyze the proper
path and intensity of heat flow during convection. In order to effec-
tively analyze the convective heat transfer, where the heat flow is
coupled with the fluid flow, Kimura and Bejan [28] developed the
concept of ‘heatfunctions’ and ‘heatlines’ as described below.

An analogy between ‘C’ (Eqs. (1a) and (1b)) and ‘h’ (Eqs. (10a) and
(10b)) clearly demonstrate that the streamlines and heatlines are
analogous and the tangent to the heatlines denotes the direction of
energy flow [27]. Eqs. (10a) and (10b) are differentiated with respect
to y and x, respectively, and subtracting the resulting equations side-
by-side yields the dimensional heatfunction equation as follows:

Eqs. (10a) and (10b) clearly indicate that, r h ¢ r T 61⁄4 0 which signify
the isotherms and the heatlines (which are not the heat flux lines)
are not perpendicular for convective heat transfer. Note that, the
above definition also applies to the energy transport due to convec-
tion through the fluid-saturated porous medium.

ð11Þ

PThe heatfunction equation, Eq. (11) is solved to obtain the heat-
function for various one dimensional and two dimensional convec-
tion problems for the fluid and porous media. In one dimensional
problems, the closed form semi-analytical solutions were obtained
by various researchers as discussed later in this article. The evalua-
tion of the heatfunction for the two dimensional problems involving
non-trivial boundary conditions is highly challenging. A number of
works on the heat flow visualization for the two dimensional prob-
lems are also available in the literature. Various modified dimen-
sionless forms of the heatfunction equation are considered by the
researchers via different scaling analysis as discussed in the later
sections.

2.2. Heatfunctions in the one-dimensional domain: boundary layer
based solutions

PA few works on the boundary layer problems involving (a) the
flow of fluid over a horizontal plate (see Fig. 1(a and b)), (b) the flow
of fluid over a vertical plate (see Fig. 1(c and d)), (c) the flow of fluid
within two parallel horizontal plates (see Fig. 1(e and f)) and (d) the
flow of fluid within two parallel vertical plates (see Fig. 1(g(cid:1)i)) are
carried out by various researchers in the past involving the fluid and
porous media with different physical systems [36(cid:1)42]. The explana-
tion of the closed form solution procedure for a few test cases
involving the forced, natural and mixed convection problems are
discussed in the next sections.

P2.2.1. Forced convection

PForced convection near a horizontal flat plate with the uniform
temperature or uniform heat flux (see Figs. 1(a and b)) via the
one-dimensional approximation is first reported by Morega and
Bejan [36]. Two cases based on the presence of the hot plate with
the cold fluid (see Fig. 1(a)) and cold plate with the hot fluid (see
Fig. 1(b)) were considered for the heat flow visualization. The
governing equations of the velocity (u and v) and temperature (T)
were solved using the similarity approach based solution method
[36]. The dimensional heatfunction [h(x, y)] is defined inside the
boundary layer region in terms of the first order derivatives [36]

. The analytical solution of the heatfunc-

tion equation for the parallel-plate space filled with a saturated
porous medium with the fully developed seepage flow was also
compared with the solution of the heatfunction equation for the par-
allel-plate channel with the pure fluid during fully developed flow
[37]. The detailed discussion of the results in terms of the heatfunc-
tions and heatlines during forced convection involving the boundary
layer flow will be presented in a later section.

P2.2.2. Natural convection

PThe closed-form analytical expressions of the heatfunction equa-
tion during natural convection adjacent to a vertical wall (the maxi-
mum wall
length 1⁄4 L) via one-dimensional approximation (see
Fig. 1(c and d)) are obtained by Costa [38] using the similar proce-
dure as discussed in section 2.2.1 [36]. The fluid flow and tempera-
ture profiles in the boundary layer region near the hot vertical wall
(see Fig. 1(c)) and cold vertical wall (see Fig. 1(d)) are obtained using
the similarity formulation approach [38]. The heatfunction for natu-
ral convection adjacent to the vertical wall is defined as follows [38]:

As explained by Costa [38], the cold wall subjected to a constant
heat flux cannot be handled via the similarity solution method.
In addition to the work reported by Costa [38], a number of ear-
lier works were also carried out on the heatline based investiga-
tion of the magnetohydrodynamic natural convection boundary
layer flow of a electrically conducting incompressible fluid [39]
and magnetohydrodynamic natural convection flow [40] along a
heated vertical flat plate. Rani et al. [41] investigated the tran-
sient, natural convective, boundary layer flow of a couple stress
fluid flowing over a vertical cylinder. The detailed discussion of
the results in terms of the heatfunctions and heatlines during
natural convection for the boundary layer flow will be presented
in a later section.

P2.2.3. Mixed convection

PMixed convection in a channel with the fully pure fluid flow,
fluid saturated porous media flow and partially fluid saturated
porous medium flow are analyzed to observe the heatline pat-
terns in a vertical channel. The non-dimensionalized momentum
and energy balance equations for all three cases were solved for
the fully developed mixed convection flow in the channels (see
Fig. 1(g(cid:1)i)) to visualize the fluid flow and temperature field
[42].

PThe heatfunction [h(x, y)] equations as defined inside the bound-
ary layer region in terms of the first order derivatives for a two-
dimensional, incompressible and steady flow can be expressed as
[42]:

where Tref is the lowest temperature. Mixed-convection fully devel-
oped flow (see Fig. 1(g(cid:1)i)) corresponds to v 1⁄4 0 and

2.3. Heatfunction formulation for turbulent flow near a hot/cold
boundary wall

PA significant amount of earlier works were involved on the heat
flow visualization during laminar flow. Till date, turbulent flow has
not been analyzed in detail for the heat flow visualization via heat-
lines. However, Bejan [29] outlined the solution of the heatfunction
during turbulent flow near a horizontal solid wall [see Fig. 1(a and
b)] and the solution is explained briefly next. The boundary layer
approximated energy balance equation for turbulent flow near a
wall is

PThe solutions of the heatfunctions illustrate that the heatlines are
inclined as they emanate from the hot wall [29]. The heatlines depict
the flow of heat from the hot fluid to the cold wall (Eq. (48)). The
heatlines are also highly inclined to the cold wall and those are pres-
ent only near the cold wall.

2.4. Heatfunctions: natural convection in enclosures in the presence of
various hot wall(s)

PThe analytical or closed form solution of the heatfunction
(governed by Poisson’s equation) subjected to various homoge-
neous or non-homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary con-
ditions is not possible in two dimensional enclosed cavities and
numerical solution methods have been employed.
It may be
noted that the evaluation of various homogeneous and non-
homogeneous boundary conditions with proper sign (+ or -) is
critical to obtain the solution for Poisson type heatfunction equa-
tion as discussed next. A number of heatfunction boundary con-
ditions were developed involving various applications. The
heatfunction boundary condition is highly dependent on various
thermal boundary conditions. A generalized framework on the
existing works on the boundary conditions for the heatfunction
within two dimensional domains can be analyzed via various
‘Types’ based on the imposed thermal boundary conditions. The
presence or absence of the adiabatic wall forms the basis of vari-
ous ‘Types’ of problems. In general, the heatfunction, H 1⁄4 0 is
assumed for an adiabatic wall. However, H 1⁄4 0 can be assumed at
any point for enclosures with no adiabatic walls. The schematic
diagrams of various two dimensional domains with hot and cold
walls involving adiabatic wall(s) [(I): Type 1], one adiabatic wall
[(II): Type 2] and no adiabatic wall [(III): Type 3] are presented in
Fig. 2 (I-III). The details of the derivation of the heatfunction
boundary conditions along various walls and junctions are pre-
sented for a few test cases in the following section. Table 1 also
summarizes various heatfunction boundary conditions along vari-
ous walls and junctions as reported in the earlier works. In addi-
tion, a few works on natural convection with the discrete heat
sources/sinks and conjugate natural convection are discussed.

The Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions of H for iso-
thermal (hot or cold) walls and the Dirichlet non-homogeneous
boundary conditions for the adiabatic walls are obtained from
Eqs. (49a), (49b), (52a) and (52b). The Dirichlet boundary condi-
tion for H has been derived and expressed in terms of the aver-
age Nusselt numbers. Note that, the solutions of Eqs. (50) and
(53) depicted via heatlines are strongly dependent on the Dirich-
let boundary condition with the appropriate sign (+ or (cid:1)) to
explain the direction of the heat flow circulation (clockwise or
anticlockwise) as discussed in the earlier work [28]. In this context,
the Nusselt number, which represents the dimensionless heat
transfer rate, requires a generic definition involving the direction
of heat flux represented by appropriate signs. A generalized defini-
tion of the local Nusselt number (Nu) along the wall of a cavity is
written as follows [46]:

Nu 1⁄4 (cid:1)dsn ¢ r u ;

ð55Þ

Here, ds for a surface is either positive or negative which is strongly
dependent on the directions of the outward normal and heat flux. It
may be noted that, ds is þ1; if the heat flux and outward normal on a
surface are in the same direction. Similarly, ds is considered as (cid:1)1; if
the heat flux and outward normal are in the opposite directions. The
importance of the usage of ds is presented in an earlier work by
Biswal and Basak [46]. Note that, n is the outward normal vector
from the surface. The average Nusselt numbers at the walls (Nu) are
obtained by integrating the local Nusselt numbers along the walls as

The tangent vector along the considered wall is represented as t and
ds corresponds to the elementary length along the wall. Here, NuDA
corresponds to the average Nusselt numbers along the left wall and
LDA corresponds to the length of the left wall (see Fig. 2(I)(a)). In the
case of the square cavity, the value of LDA is 1. Eqs. (57a) and (57b)
denote HðDÞ 1⁄4 LDANuDA and HðCÞ 1⁄4 LBCNuBC; respectively. Note that,
Eq. (49a) also denotes that, H along the adiabatic wall is constant in
the presence of static wall (U 1⁄4 V 1⁄4 0). Therefore, HðCÞ 1⁄4 LBCNuBC 1⁄4
LADNuAD 1⁄4 HðDÞ; and this relationship is the consequence of the
balance of dimensionless heat flux (energy in D energy out) i.e,
LADNuAD 1⁄4 LBCNuBC. A reference value HðCÞ 1⁄4 HðDÞ 1⁄4 HðCDÞ 1⁄4 0
can also be assumed and the Dirichlet boundary conditions can be
obtained for H(A) and H(B) [46].

PAfter the first work by Kimura and Bejan [28], the research was
directed to demonstrate the heat flow visualization for natural con-
vection within various differentially heated square enclosures (Fig. 2
(I)(a)) [47(cid:1)50],
inclined square enclosures (Fig. 2(I)(b)) [51,52],
rhombic and parallellogrammic enclosures (Fig. 2(I)(c)) [53(cid:1)56],
trapezoidal enclosures (Fig. 2(I)(d)) [57,58] and curved side walled

Penclosures (Fig. 2(I)(e(cid:1)f)) [59]. The derivation and implementation
of the heatfunction boundary conditions are non-trivial for the
inclined and curved walls. In addition, the derivation and calculation
of the local Nusselt numbers along the inclined/curved walls are
highly challenging as reported in various works reported by Basak
and co-workers [51,52,54,55,57(cid:1)59]. As reported in a representative
case by Basak et al.[52], the dimensionless heatfunction equations in
the X and Y directions are given as

In order to solve the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)), the heatfunc-
tion boundary conditions (Table 1) were derived in a similar way as
presented earlier (Eqs. (57a) and (57b)).

PIn addition to the pure fluid media and fluid saturated porous
media, the type 1a boundary condition is also used to investigate
the diverse areas of the natural convection such as double diffusive
convection [56].

PType 1b
PA few works on the heat flow visualization within differentially
heated right angled triangular enclosures were presented by Kaluri
et al. [60] and Anandalakshmi et al. [61] for the fluid and porous
media. The right angled triangular enclosure was differentially
heated in the presence of the adiabatic bottom wall as presented in
Fig. 2(I)(g). Various cases based on the uniform/linear heating of the
left/right walls were considered in earlier works [60,61]. The Neu-
mann boundary conditions, n ¢ r H 1⁄4 0 for the isothermally hot or
cold left or right wall and n ¢ r H 1⁄4 1 or (cid:1)cos’ for the linearly heated
left/right wall were derived. The reference of the heatfunction
(H 1⁄4 0) was considered along the bottom adiabatic wall (AB) and
HðAÞ 1⁄4 HðBÞ 1⁄4 0. The Dirichlet boundary condition along the top
edge and the Neumann boundary conditions along the hot/cold
walls were obtained from Eqs. (58a) and (58b). At the top vertex C,
the Dirichlet boundary condition for H can be obtained by integrat-
ing Eq. 58 as [60,61]

Basak et al. [62] also carried out natural convection studies within
the porous right angled triangular enclosures with the concave/con-
vex hot surface (Fig. 2I(h) and (i)). The left vertical wall was cold in
the presence of the hot concave/convex right wall and adiabatic bot-
tom wall. The Neumann heatfunction boundary conditions for the
isothermal heating or cooling and Dirichlet heatfunction boundary
condition for the adiabatic wall were implemented as illustrated in
Table 1to solve the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) [62].

PType 1c
PBello-Ochende [63] studied the natural convection heat transfer
via the heatline approach within the square cavity with the
Rayleigh-B(cid:1)enard heating involving the hot bottom, cold top and
adiabatic side walls (Fig. 2I(j)). Kaddiri et al. [64] conducted a two-
dimensional steady-state Rayleigh-B(cid:1)enard convection of thermode-
pendent power-law fluids confined in a square cavity (Fig. 2(I)(j)). In
addition, Raji et al. [65] reported the investigation of natural convec-
tion within an air filled square cavity involving the sinusoidally
(with time) bottom hot wall and cold top wall involving adiabatic
side walls. Later, Dhar et al. [66] carried out the unsteady state natu-
ral convection studies during solidification of a eutectic solution in a
rectangular cavity subjected to the Rayleigh-B(cid:1)enard heating.

PThe heat flow visualization during natural convection involving
the Rayleigh-B(cid:1)enard heating of various square and rhombic enclo-
sures was studied by Anandalakshmi and Basak [54,55] (Fig. 2(I)(k)).
The Neumann boundary conditions, n ¢ r H 1⁄4 0 are valid for the iso-
thermal walls. As the left and right walls are adiabatic, the values of
the heatfunction are constants along the side walls (Eqs. (58a) and
(58b)). The reference value of the heatfunction, HðAÞ 1⁄4 HðDÞ 1⁄4 HðADÞ
1⁄4 0 was assumed along the left wall. The Dirichlet heatfunction
boundary conditions along the right wall were derived from Eqs. (58a)
and (58b). The heatfunction boundary conditions for the representa-
tive cases [54,55] are presented in Table 1.

P2.4.2. Enclosures with multiple hot or cold walls and one adiabatic wall

PType 2a
PBasak and Roy [35] considered the uniformly or sinusoidally
heated bottom wall in the presence of the hot or cold left wall, cold
right wall and adiabatic top wall (Fig. 2(II)(a and b)). The Neumann
boundary conditions, n ¢ r H 1⁄4 0 were considered for the isother-
mally hot/cold bottom/side walls whereas, n ¢ r H 1⁄4 p cospX were
considered for the sinusoidally heated bottom wall [35]. The refer-
ence condition, HðCÞ 1⁄4 HðDÞ 1⁄4 HðCDÞ 1⁄4 0 was assumed along the
adiabatic wall following Eqs. (58a) and (58b) (see Table 1). Further,
the Dirichlet boundary conditions of the heatfunction were derived

Pusing Eqs. (58a) and (58b) as illustrated in Table 1. The Dirichlet
boundary conditions at the junctions (A and B) are shown below.

Following the work of Basak and Roy [35], various works on the
similar type of thermal boundary conditions (isothermal/sinusoi-
dal hot bottom wall, cold side walls and adiabatic top wall) were
carried out for natural convection in square enclosures with dif-
ferent thermal aspect ratios [67], rhombic enclosures [68,69]
(Fig. 2(II)(c)), tilted square enclosures [70(cid:1)72] (Fig. 2(II)(d)) and
trapezoidal enclosures [73,74] (Fig. 2(II)(e)) for the fluid and
porous media. The similar Dirichlet boundary conditions at the
junctions (Eqs. (62a) and (62b)) were implemented to derive the
heatfunction boundary conditions [67(cid:1)74] (Table 1). In addition,
Hossain and Alim [75] numerically investigated the two-dimensional
laminar steady-state MHD natural convection within the trapezoidal
cavity of various inclination angles with the non-uniformly heated
bottom wall, cold side walls and adiabatic top wall via the heatline
concept (Fig. 2(II)(d)).

PAnalysis of natural convection within square and trapezoidal
enclosures involving the isothermally hot bottom wall with (a)
the linearly heated side walls and (b) the isothermally cooled
left wall with the linearly heated right wall in the presence of
the adiabatic top wall was carried out by Basak et al. [76] and
Ramakrishna et al. [77] (Fig. 2II(f)). The Neumann boundary con-
dition with n ¢ r H 1⁄4 0 was considered along the isothermally
heated bottom wall or isothermally cooled right wall. Along the
linearly heated left and right wall, n ¢ r H 1⁄4 § sin’ was imple-
mented. Along the top adiabatic wall, HðCÞ 1⁄4 HðDÞ 1⁄4 HðCDÞ 1⁄4 0
was considered. The following Dirichlet heatfunction (H) boundary
conditions (see Table 1) were derived from Eqs. (58a) and (58b): at

based on the orientation of the triangle were considered for the
study and the triangular cavity was comprised of the horizontal/
vertical adiabatic wall with the linearly heated inclined walls [79]
(Fig. 2II(h(cid:1)j)]. The Neumann boundary conditions were derived
such that, n ¢ r H 1⁄4 sin’ or (cid:1) sin’; along the inclined walls. It may
be noted that, the boundary conditions for Type 2d are given only for

P2.4.3. Type 1a and 2a: natural convection involving nanofluids

PIn addition to the fluid and porous media, a few works on natural
convection in nanofluid filled enclosures were also carried out via
the heatline approach [80(cid:1)82] involving type 1a and type 2a bound-
ary conditions (Fig. 2(I)(a) and (II)(a)). The steady two-dimensional
natural convection flow in the square cavity filled with the base fluid
(water) and nanofluid (Cu, Al2O3 and TiO2 with the mass fraction
(cid:3) 0.2) was considered [80]. The heatfunction equations in the

P2.4.4. Enclosures with multiple hot or cold walls and no adiabatic walls

PType 3a
PDue to the absence of the adiabatic wall, the implementation of the
reference of the heatfunction is non-trivial for the systems with only
hot/cold walls. A generalized set of the heatfunction boundary condi-
tions was also derived for a square cavity with the wavy right vertical
wall [83]. The geometry of the two-dimensional air-filled square cavity
with the wavy right vertical wall [f 1⁄4 1 (cid:1) λ þ λ cosð2pnyÞ; where n is
the number of undulations and λ is the wave amplitude] filled with the
viscous fluid is shown in Fig. 2(III)(a) [83]. The bottom wall was sinusoi-
dally heated in the presence of the cold side walls and top wall (Fig. 2III
(a)). In (ξ, h) domain, the equations of the heatfunction (Eqs. (58a) and
(58b)) are expressed as follows [83]:

PVarol et al. [78] also considered natural convection heat flow in
the triangular cavities with the non-isothermal heating of the bot-
tom wall involving the cold left and right walls (Fig. 2(III)(b)). The
reference of the heatfunction boundary conditions was considered
at the origin as HðAÞ 1⁄4 0. The heatfunction boundary conditions
(Table 1) along various walls were derived using the similar formula-
tions as mentioned earlier (Eq. (64a)(cid:1)(64c)) and the boundary con-
ditions are summarized in Table 1.

PType 3c
PBasak et al. [84,85] studied natural convection within the
inverted isosceles triangular cavity involving (a) the hot inclined
walls with the cold horizontal wall and (b) the cold inclined walls
with the hot horizontal wall (Fig. 2(III)(c)). The Neumann boundary
conditions along the isothermal walls are specified as n ¢ r H 1⁄4 0. In
the case of a triangle involving the cold or hot inclined walls (AC
and AB) and hot top wall (BC), the reference of the heatfunction,
HðAÞ 1⁄4 0 was considered at the junction of the cold or hot walls
(Fig. 2(III)(c)). The heatfunction boundary conditions (cold inclined
walls and hot top wall) (Table 1) were derived as follows [84]:

Using the similar approach (Eqs. (75a)(cid:1)(75b)), Basak et al. [86(cid:1)89]
also solved the heatfunction equations for the heat flow visualization
within the entrapped triangular enclosures (Fig. 2(III)(d)) filled with
various fluid and porous media. The walls were considered as iso-
thermally hot/cold in the absence of the adiabatic wall. Thus, H 1⁄4 0
was considered at the point, E such that HðEÞ 1⁄4 0 (see Fig. 2(III)(d)).
Further, the Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions were
derived at the various points using the similar approach as discussed
above (Eqs. (75a) and (75b)). The detailed discussion of the results in
terms of the heatfunctions and heatlines during natural convection
within two dimensional enclosures involving various thermal
boundary conditions will be presented in a later section.

2.5. Heatfunctions: natural convection in enclosures with discrete
heaters along the walls

PThe presence of the discrete heat sources along the walls
results in various interesting heat and fluid flow characteristics.
Also, the heatfunction formulation is non-trivial due to the pres-
ence of the discrete heat sources and sinks. A number of works
on natural convection within various cavities with one or

the

left

along

and right walls were

Pmultiple heating sources/sinks are found in the literature
[32,35,43,47,90(cid:1)103]. The systems with the horizontal (top and
bottom) adiabatic walls involving various hot or cold or adiabatic
strips
considered
[32,43,90,91] and the schematic representations are shown in
Fig. 3(I). In addition, the systems involving one adiabatic wall
(top wall) in the presence of various hot or cold or adiabatic
strips along the side and bottom walls were also studied
[35,95(cid:1)103] (Fig. 3(II)). In another situation, the hot or cold or
adiabatic strips are distributed along all the walls of the cavity
as illustrated in Fig. 3(III) [47].

PThe formulation of the heatfunction boundary condition for
one representative case involving the distributed heat sources
along the bottom and side walls involving one adiabatic wall is
presented in Table 2 [96] (Fig. 3(II)(d)). Along the isothermal
hot or cold strips, Neumann heatfunction boundary condition
(n ¢ r H 1⁄4 0) was implemented. The reference condition of the heat-
function (HðCÞ 1⁄4 HðDÞ 1⁄4 HðCDÞ 1⁄4 0) was considered along the top
adiabatic wall (Fig. 3(II)(d)). Further, a set of the Dirichlet boundary
conditions for H were derived at various junction points along the
bottom and side walls by integrating Eqs. (58a) and (58b). A repre-
sentative Dirichlet condition for a junction point (Ya) is given below
[96]:

In a similar way as presented in Eq. (76), the heatfunction boundary
conditions at various junctions were derived for the considered case
study [96] (Fig. 3(II)(d)). The detailed derivations of the heatfunction
boundary conditions for all test cases are not discussed for the brev-
ity. The heatfunction boundary conditions for a case study [96] are
presented in Table 2 (Fig. 3(II)(d)).

PThe detailed explanation on the distribution of the heatlines and
the effects of various geometrical and thermal parameters during
natural convection in discretely heated enclosures will be presented
in a later section.

2.6. Heatfunctions: conjugate natural convection in enclosures

PDue to various practical applications involving conduction heat
transfer at the thick solid wall(s) and convection heat transfer
within fluid, a number of works on the conjugate natural convec-
tion involving various thermal boundary conditions are found in
the literature [30,44,45,104(cid:1)117]. Fig. 4(I) illustrates the schematic
representations of the two dimensional square enclosures involving
thick wall(s). The schematic representation of the two dimensional
square enclosures involving thick fins and rectangular blocks on
the walls is illustrated in Fig. 4(II). The schematic representation of
the physical systems involving square block(s) inside the enclosure
involving different thermal boundary conditions is presented in
Fig. 4(III).

PA few representative cases involving thick walls (Fig. 4(I)) are
considered for the derivation of the heatfunction boundary condi-
tions. The differentially heated square cavity involving the side walls
of finite thicknesses as reported by Basak et al. [104] is taken as the
representative case (Fig. 4(I)(a and c)). Note that, heat transfer in
the solid phase occurs due to conduction whereas convection is the
dominant mode of heat transfer in the fluid phase. The unified
energy balance equation for the two dimensional conjugate natural
convection [104] is as follows:

PEqs. (81a) and (81b) finally lead to the standard heatfunction
equation, Eq. (59). The Neumann boundary condition (n ¢ r H 1⁄4 0)
was assumed along the isothermal hot or cold walls. The Dirichlet
boundary condition for the bottom insulated wall is obtained from
Eq. (81a) which is simplified into HðAÞ 1⁄4 HðBÞ 1⁄4 HðABÞ 1⁄4 0. The
Dirichlet boundary condition along the top insulated wall also can
be derived using Eq. (81a) in a similar way as discussed for type 1a.

PAnother way to derive and represent the heatfunction boundary
conditions for the conjugate convection problems is presented as

separately for the fluid and solid phases. The dimensionless forms of
the heatfunction equations in the fluid region (Hf) take the similar
form as presented in Eqs. (58a), (58b), (59). The solid region corre-
sponds to U 1⁄4 V 1⁄4 0. Thus, the heatfunction equation in the solid

heatfunction, H is continuous such that, the heatfunction of the
solid cylinder is identical to the heatfunction of the surrounding
fluid.

PKhorasanizadeh et al. [125] analyzed the heatlines during mixed
convection in a lid-driven cavity (Fig. 5(e)) filled with Cu-water
nanofluid. The dimensionless energy balance equation for mixed

which yield a single equation and take the form of Eq. (59). The heat-
function expression is obtained at the points C and D using the
homogeneous heatfunction boundary condition, HðAÞ 1⁄4 HðBÞ 1⁄4 0
(see Fig. 5(e)).

PBiswas et al. [126] investigated mixed convection induced by the
movement of the side wall of a differentially heated square cavity
involving a centrally positioned adiabatic block as presented in Fig. 5(f).
The energy balance and heatfunction equations as considered by Biswas
et al. [126] are presented earlier as Eqs. (87), (90a) and (90b), respec-
tively. The heatfunction expression is obtained at the points C and D
using the reference value, HðAÞ 1⁄4 HðBÞ 1⁄4 0 (Fig. 5(f)). The boundary

As the block is adiabatic, the boundary conditions along the surfaces
of the adiabatic block can be obtained as H 1⁄4 constant along the sur-
faces of the block. The detailed explanation of the results in terms of
the heatfunctions and heatlines during mixed convection in two
dimensional enclosures will be presented in a later section.

2.8. Heatfunction formulation: turbulent flow in enclosures

PAlthough a number of earlier works are devoted on laminar flow
in various geometries or enclosures involving natural and mixed
convection, the heatfunction evaluation during turbulent flows have
not been explored in various situations till date. However, a few ear-
lier works outlined the heatfunction governing equations during tur-
bulent flow in slot ventilated enclosures [127,128]. The energy
balance equation for incompressible fluid within a slot ventilated
enclosure during turbulent flow is [127,128]

PThe heatfunctions can be evaluated from above derivatives while
temperature and flow are simulated via finite volume method. Note
that, the heatfunctions are estimated with differences in values but
not with absolute values [128]. A few test cases demonstrated that
the heatlines can be successfully employed to visualize the heat flow
during the turbulent slot-ventilated flow with hot and cold regimes
[127,128].

2.9. Sensitivity of the heatfunction boundary conditions

PBiswal and Basak [46] investigated the effect of the implementa-
tion of the heatfunction boundary conditions. This study was carried
out for natural convection heat flow within enclosures with various
shapes filled with different fluids. The heatfunction equation
(Eq. (59)) was solved for various test cases of the heatfunction
boundary conditions via Galerkin finite element method. Note that,
the imposition of the reference of H or H 1⁄4 0 may be non-unique as
H 1⁄4 0 may be assumed at any point or surface especially for the sys-
tem with more than one adiabatic wall or no adiabatic wall. Biswal
and Basak [46] explored various thermal (uniform heating/cooling)
and heatfunction boundary conditions for enclosures with various
geometries.

PTwo sets of enclosures were taken into consideration based on
the axis of symmetry of the geometrical configurations and thermal
boundary conditions (see Fig. 6) [46]. As presented in Fig. 6, Group I
consists of square, trapezoidal and curved enclosures and Group II
consists of parallellogrammic and tilted square enclosures [46].
Three sets of the thermal boundary conditions (Fig. 6) such as (a)
case 1: the left wall is isothermally hot, right wall is isothermally
cold and horizontal walls are adiabatic, (b) case 2: the bottom wall is
isothermally hot, left and right walls are cold and top wall is adia-
batic and (c) case 3: the bottom wall is isothermally hot and other
walls are isothermally cold. Sensitivity of various boundary condi-
tions were experimented via assuming, H 1⁄4 0 at various locations
[46]. The reference heatfunction value, H 1⁄4 0 was considered at the
the top wall
(HðAÞ 1⁄4 HðBÞ 1⁄4 HðABÞ 1⁄4 0) and at
bottom wall
(HðCÞ 1⁄4 HðDÞ 1⁄4 HðCDÞ 1⁄4 0) for cases 1a and 1b, respectively (Fig. 6
(i)). As seen from Fig. 6(ii) the reference, H 1⁄4 0 was assumed along
the top adiabatic wall (HðCÞ 1⁄4 HðDÞ 1⁄4 HðCDÞ 1⁄4 0), at the bottom
left (HðAÞ 1⁄4 0) and bottom right (HðBÞ 1⁄4 0) corners for cases 2a, 2b
and 2c, respectively. Similarly, H 1⁄4 0 was assumed at the mid point
of the top wall (HðMÞ 1⁄4 0), top left (HðDÞ 1⁄4 0) and bottom right
(HðBÞ 1⁄4 0) corners of the cavity for cases 3a, 3b and 3c, respectively
(Fig. 6(iii)). Note that, various possible Dirichlet boundary conditions
for the heatfunction in terms of the average Nusselt numbers were
derived and examined for all cases and presented in Table 3. The
results in terms of the heatfunctions and heatlines will be discussed
in a later section.

2.10. Solution procedure for the heatfunction evaluation

PThe momentum and energy balance equations can be solved via
various numerical techniques to obtain the velocity and temperature
components. Further, using the velocity and temperature compo-
nents, Poisson equation for the heatfunction is solved with proper
heatfunction boundary conditions as discussed earlier. In general,
various numerical techniques such as the finite difference, finite vol-
ume and finite element methods were used by the earlier research-
ers to solve the heatfunction equations.

PIn this review, an outline on the solution procedure via the Galer-
kin finite element method have been presented. The governing
equations were solved via the Galerkin finite element method to
obtain the velocity and temperature components [129]. The velocity
(U and V), temperature (u) and heatfunction (H) components are

configuration) and Group II (asymmetric thermal boundary condition and geometrical
configuration) for (i) differentially heated cavity, (ii) hot bottom wall, cold side walls
and top adiabatic wall, and (iii) hot bottom wall with cold side and top walls. Inset
tables show various locations of the reference condition of the heatfunction (H 1⁄4 0).

tion and mixed convection can be derived and they are found in ear-
lier works [95(cid:1)100,104,118(cid:1)123]. Substituting Eq. (102) in Eq. (59),

The above residual equation (Eq. (103)) is further supplemented
with various Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in order
to obtain an unique solution (solution can be obtained via LU decom-
position of linear algebraic system of equations). The Neumann and
Dirichlet boundary conditions of H are obtained as derived from
Eqs. (58a) and (58b) and are specified earlier for various thermal
boundary conditions in the earlier sections. The sample heatfunction
boundary conditions are also presented in Tables 1(cid:1)3 involving vari-
ous physical systems (Figs. 2(cid:1)6).

2.11. Heatfunction vs. synergy: is synergy a fundamental quantity?

PThe concept termed as ‘synergy’ (literal meaning is joint work or
combined action) was proposed by Guo et al. [130] to demonstrate
the collaboration of conduction with the enthalpy flow in convec-
tion. As reported in the first work by Guo et al. [130] in 1998, the
mathematical background of the concept ‘synergy’ is presented
next. The energy balance equations for the duct flow and boundary
layer flows are written as follows:

PGuo et al. [130] also stated that, the synergy concept helps in under-
standing the enhancement or optimization of the convective heat
transfer. In addition, Guo et al. [130] argued that, based on the syn-
ergy concept (field synergy degree between the velocity and temper-
ature gradient fields),
transfer could be
the convective heat
enhanced by raising the intensity of heat source.

PHowever, in a recent article, Bejan [131] compared the heatlines
and synergy. Bejan [131] reported that synergy is merely a replica-
tion of heatlines [28]. Bejan [131] also proved that synergy is not
related to the heat transfer enhancement technique unless there is a
change in geometrical configurations or special inserts to accelerate
the flow. Bejan [131] criticized the idea of correlating the heat source
term in conduction term with the convective term. In addition, Bejan
[131] added that, the heat flow by thermal convection is absent
when force is zero whereas, the heat flow by thermal diffusion con-
tinues. Bejan [131] also commented that the idea of increasing the
synergy angle between the heat flux lines and streamlines for better
heat transfer enhancement is wrong because the maximum angle
occurs on the centerline, where heat transfer is significantly less.
Also, the designer does not know how to access the synergy angle
for better heat transfer, which corresponds to change in the flow
configuration. Finally, it is concluded that, synergy is a repetition of
the heatlines and the synergy angle maximization concept has no
physical basis [131].

3. Application of heatlines for boundary layer type problems

3.1. Forced convection boundary layer flows

PMorega and Bejan [36] reported the analytical solutions of the
heatfunction equations (see Eqs. (18), (22) and (24)) for the laminar
boundary layer with the forced convection involving flow near a flat
wall with isothermal and isoflux boundary conditions (see Fig. 1(a
and b) for the isothermal case). Fig. 7 (a and b) illustrate the pattern
of the heatlines near the hot wall and cold wall, respectively corre-
sponding to Pr 1⁄4 0:72 (air) [36]. The path of the convective heat
transfer from a hot fluid to a cold wall (Fig. 7(b)) differs totally from
the path followed by convection from a hot wall to a cold fluid
(Fig. 7(a)). The hot wall acts as the heat source to heat the cold fluid
and the heat flow trajectories are emanated from the hot wall (Fig. 7
(a)). On the other hand, the heatlines from the fluid at X 1⁄4 0 are dis-
tributed throughout the cold wall signifying the heat flow from the
hot fluid to the cold wall (Fig. 7(b)). The heatlines emanate from the
hot wall and they are swept downstream by the flowing fluid. Thus,
the heatlines are slanted towards the hot wall. The density of the
heatlines is slightly larger near the upstream region based on the
larger temperature gradients. Further, the density of the heatlines
decreases along the downstream direction (Fig. 7(a)). As the hot fluid
flows along the cold wall, the maximum temperature gradient was
observed at the entry point (Fig. 7(b)). Consequently, the dense

Pthe exponential decay of the mean temperature difference. On the
other hand, in the presence of the cold wall (Fig. 1(f)), the heatlines
are slightly dense at the entry zone due to higher thermal gradient
and those are sparser along the trailing zone. The heatlines are per-
pendicular to the walls at the point where they meet the walls
depicting conduction heat transfer near the walls involving both the
hot and cold walls. Morega and Bejan [37] concluded that, the pat-
tern of the heatlines is highly influenced by the role of the walls
(heat source/sink) involving flow over a plate or flow within parallel
plates.

3.2. Natural convection boundary layer flows

PThe solution of the heatfunction for laminar natural convection
involving boundary layers near the hot or cold vertical wall was
reported by Costa [38] (see Fig. 1(c and d)) via the similarity
approach (see Eqs. (28) and (31)). In order to present the heatfunc-
tion analysis during natural convection for the wide range of Prandtl
numbers, Costa [38] expressed similarity variables as the function of
Pr in the analytical expression for the dimensionless heatfunction
(see Eq. (28)). The dimensionless heatlines for the isothermal hot
wall at Pr 1⁄4 0:73 are shown in Figs. 7(c). The perpendicular heatlines
near the hot wall
indicates conduction dominant heat transfer
(Fig. 7(c)). It is observed that, the bottom portion of the hot wall
delivers maximum amount of heat to the cold fluid based on the
dense heatlines. Thus, the heat transfer rate is maximum near the
bottom portion of the hot wall as seen from Fig. 7(c). On the other
hand, heatlines are sparse near top portion of the hot wall depicting
less heat transfer rate to that portion (Fig. 7(c)). The corresponding
heatlines along the isothermal cold vertical wall are presented in
Fig. 7(d). The heat flow occurs in the negative X direction involving
the isothermal cold wall (Fig. 7(d)) which is in contrast to the situa-
tion involving the isothermal hot wall (Fig. 7(c)). The presence of the
cold wall results in the increase in density of the hot fluid. Thus, the
dense fluid moves downward to deliver heat to the isothermal cold
surface (Fig. 7(d)). The heatlines are denser within the fluid com-
pared to those along the cold wall as seen from Fig. 7(d). In contrast
to the situation with hot wall, the heatlines are uniformly dense
throughout the fluid zone in the presence of the hot fluid and cold
wall (Fig. 7(d)). The density of heatlines along the X axis is larger
compared to that along the Y axis (Fig. 7(d)). The top portion of the
cold wall receives less amount of heat based on the presence of
sparse heatlines (Fig. 7(d)). The heat transfer rate across the bound-
ary layer through the exterior edge is larger for the case with the iso-
thermal cold wall and hot fluid (Fig. 7(d)) in contrast to the case with
isothermal hot wall and cold fluid (Fig. 7(c)). Overall, the heatlines
presented a clear picture of the heat flow during boundary layer
flow involving hot and cold vertical walls.

PAnalysis of

the magnetohydrodynamic natural convection
boundary layer flow of an electrically conducting incompressible
fluid along a hot vertical flat plate in the presence of the strong cross
magnetic field was reported by Siddiqa et al. [39]. The analytical
solution for the heatfunction can be obtained using the governing
equations (Eqs. (26a) and (26b)) as discussed in Section 2.2.2. The
results in terms of the heatlines were reported for the various values
of Buoyancy ratio parameter (5 (cid:3) Bu (cid:3) 10) and Schmidt number
(1 (cid:3) Sc (cid:3) 50). Note that, Bu 1⁄4
where GrC; Gr and D
correspond to Grashof number for mass diffusion, Grashof number
for thermal diffusion and mass diffusion coefficient, respectively.
The influence of Bu on the heatline trajectories is found to be more
prominent near the leading edge of the plate. It was observed that,
the heatlines along the wall are less dense at the higher Bu signifying
lower heat transfer rates. Also, the heatfunction values decrease far
away from the wall as the hot surface transfers significant amount of
heat to the nearby zone of fluids. It was also observed that, the heat-
lines become more intense near the boundary as Sc increases from 1

and Sc 1⁄4

vection over a vertical wall (Pr 1⁄4 0:73) [38] (refer Fig. 1(c-d)) (Reprinted with
permission from Elsevier).

Pheatlines at the upstream indicate the maximum heat transfer rate
from hot fluid to the cold wall (Fig. 7(b)). As the heatlines approach
to the boundary layer region, they slowly bend and become perpen-
dicular to the cold wall. The perpendicular heatlines near the wall
depict the conduction dominant heat transfer (Fig. 7(b)). The change
in the direction of the heatline occurs, approximately, at the half
of the distance between the left edge of the boundary layer and
the point where the heatline ends the cold wall. The density of the
heatlines decreases and the sparse heatlines are seen near the right
edge of the cold wall indicating the less heat transfer at that region
(Fig. 7(b)). The trends of the heatline trajectories near the hot/cold
wall at Pr 1⁄4 0:02 (Figures not shown) are found to be qualitatively
similar to Pr 1⁄4 0:72 (Fig. 7(a and b)). However, based on the high
thermal diffusivity, the disperse heatlines extend well away from
the wall for Pr 1⁄4 0:2.

PMorega and Bejan [37] also studied the heatline patterns during
forced convection heat and fluid flow in the fluid saturated porous
medium with various physical systems involving (a) boundary layer
near an isothermal wall (see Fig. 1(a and b)), (b) boundary layer near
a wall with the uniform heat flux (see Fig. 1(a)) and (c) porous layer
confined by two parallel plates (see Fig. 1(e and f)). The analytical
solutions for the hot and cold isothermal walls are illustrated in
Eqs. (25a) and (25b), respectively. The fluid acts as the heat source
and the wall acts as the heat sink for the system involving the cold
wall (similar to Fig. 7(b)). Thus, the heatlines emerge from the flow-
ing fluid and end on the cold wall depicting the heat flow path. In
contrast, in the case of the hot wall with the uniform temperature or
uniform heat flux (similar to Fig. 7(a)), the heatlines emanate from
the hot wall and those are slanted towards the direction of the fluid
flow signifying the exact path of the heat flow. The density of the
heatlines along X axis is larger for the hot wall (similar to Fig. 7(a))
compared to that for the cold wall (similar to Fig. 7(b)). On the other
hand, the density of the heatlines along Y axis is larger for the cold
wall (similar to Fig. 7(b)) compared to that for the hot wall (similar
to Fig. 7(a)). During the flow within the parallel plates involving the
hot walls (Fig. 1(e)), the heatlines near the hot walls are parallel and
those are inclined in the direction of the fluid flow (Figures not
shown). The density of the heatlines decreases along the wall due to

Pto 50. In another work, Siddiqa et al. [40] presented a boundary layer
analysis in order to study the effect of the hall current on the magne-
tohydrodynamic natural convection flow with the strong cross mag-
netic field. The heatlines were plotted and illustrated in details for
the various values of the hall current parameter, mh (1⁄4 vc
c ),
where vc measures the cyclotron frequency of electron and tc is the
collision time of electrons with ions, for the case of liquid metals
(Pr 1⁄4 0:015). At the lower mh, the heatlines were smooth monotonic
curves whereas, at the higher mh, the heatlines were found to be dis-
torted especially near the central region. The greater distortion in
the heatlines can be explained based on the higher magnetic force,
which acts as a resistive force. Overall, the heatlines illustrated a
clear picture of heat flow under the effects of the hall current.

PRani et al. [41] investigated the transient and natural convection
boundary layer flow of a couple stress fluid flowing over a vertical
cylinder. The heatfunctions were obtained based on the steady
energy balance equation. The governing equations of the heatfunc-
tions in x and r directions are analogous to Eqs. (26a) and (26b),
respectively. A second order partial differential equation of the heat-
function was finally obtained. The heatfunctions were evaluated via
second order central difference formula. The results were obtained
in terms of the heatlines for various values of Schmidt number
(Sc 1⁄4 0:6 and 0.94), Prandtl number (Pr 1⁄4 0:7 and 7) and Buoyancy
ratio (Bu 1⁄4 2 and 8). Common to all the parameters, the heatlines
are denser near the bottom portion compared to the top portion of
the wall. The rate of heat transfer from the hot wall to the fluid is
highest at the leading edge and is decreased with an increase in the
axial position. Therefore, the heatlines near the wall are dense. The
maximum value of the heatfunction decreases with Sc whereas, that
increases with Pr and Bu. The deviation of the heatlines along the
hot wall is more prominent for the larger Pr. It is found that the heat-
lines are slightly distorted near the wall for higher Sc and Pr due to
the enhanced convective effects. Overall, the heatlines are useful to
visualize the convective heat flow over a vertical cylinder.

3.3. Mixed convection heat transfer in channels

PThe heat flow was visualized during fully developed laminar flow
involving mixed convection heat transfer for the channels filled with
fluid, fluid saturated porous medium and partially filled with porous
layer [42] (Figs. 1(g(cid:1)i)). The analytical solutions for the heatfunction
are presented in Eqs. (37), (39)(cid:1)(41). The heatline patterns in the

Gr
Re

channel involving Pe 1⁄4 0:01 and
1⁄4 1 are not affected from the
flow of fluid. Thus, the heat flow path is almost horizontal (Figures
not shown). As Pe increases to 1, the heatlines are highly distorted
based on the dominant convection heat transfer in the vertical direc-
tion. The convection heat transport rate in the vertical direction
Gr
increases as Pe increases to 5 for the pure fluid medium. As
Re
increases to 400, the heatlines at Pe 1⁄4 0:01 remain similar to those

for

Gr
Re

1⁄4 1 for the fluid medium. At Pe 1⁄4 1; the heatlines travel

upward followed by a downward path after some distance to reach

the left wall at

Gr
Re

1⁄4 400. Further, the heatlines are highly distorted

at Pe 1⁄4 5 and

Gr
Re

1⁄4 400 involving the fluid medium. At Pe 1⁄4 1 and 5,

eventhough the convective effect exists, the distortion of the heat-
lines is less prominent for the channel filled with the fluid saturated
porous medium involving

1⁄4 1 and 400 (Figures not shown).

mission from Elsevier).

P(Fig. 8(a and b)). At Rk 1⁄4 0:05; Gr
1⁄4 2000 and Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)4; the iso-
Re
therms are parallel to the vertical walls and the temperature in the
right half of the channel [porous layer] is maintained uniform with u
1⁄4 0:5 due to the low thermal conductivity ratio or high effective
thermal conductivity of the porous medium. Consequently, the iso-
therms with u (cid:3) 0.5 are observed in the left half of the channel [fluid
layer] due to the high resistance to the heat flow in the left half of
the channel (Fig. 8(a)). The fluid flow in the right half of the channel
[porous layer] is weak compared to left half of the channel [fluid
layer] based on the high flow resistance within the porous medium
in the right half (Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)4) (Fig. 8(a)). The heatlines are perpendic-
ular to isothermal vertical walls depicting conductive heat transport.
The lesser gradients of the heatfunction further indicate that heat is
transported horizontally from the hot wall to the cold wall [conduc-
tive heat transport] at Pe 1⁄4 0:01. In addition to the horizontal heat-
lines in the right half of the channel
[porous layer] due to
conduction, the distorted heatlines due to convection are also found
to occur near the middle portion of the channel at Pe 1⁄4 1 (see the
middle panel of heatlines of Fig. 8(a)). Also, the heat transfer rate
near the interface region between the porous [right half of the chan-
nel] and fluid layers [left half of the channel] is enhanced with Pe as
seen from the large thermal gradient based on the highly dense
heatlines. As seen from the middle and right panels of Fig. 8(a), the
heatlines emerge from the right wall and rise from the interface
region due to the convection dominant heat transfer in the left half
of the channel at Pe 1⁄4 1 and 5. The heat transfer rate is high near the
interface region between the porous and fluid layers as seen from
the large thermal gradient based on the highly dense heatlines (see
the right panel of Fig. 8(a). As the conductivity ratio increases
(Rk 1⁄4 100), the porous region offers the high resistance (low thermal
conductivity) to the heat flow compared to the lower conductivity
ratio (Rk 1⁄4 0:05). In addition, the thermal conductivity of the fluid
region is larger for Rk 1⁄4 100 and the spatial distributions at Rk 1⁄4
100 are shown in Fig. 8(b). At Rk 1⁄4 100; the buoyancy effect is less
(due to the less thermal gradients) in the left half and a parabolic
velocity profile exists. Also, based on significantly larger thermal
conductivity of the fluid medium, a cold zone is found near the left
half of the channel at Rk 1⁄4 100. As explained earlier, the heatlines
are smooth, parallel and those are perpendicular to the isothermal
walls at Pe 1⁄4 0:01 (see the left panel of Fig. 8(b)). The heat flow in
the horizontal direction from the porous medium towards the inter-
face is significantly less based on the less effective thermal conduc-
tivity of the porous medium. Along the right wall, the large thermal
gradient based on the highly dense heatlines are seen for Pe 1⁄4 1 at

PRk 1⁄4 100 compared to Rk 1⁄4 0:05 (see the middle panels of Fig. 8(a
and b)). Also, conduction heat transfer from the right portion to the
interface is weak as seen from the comparatively sparse heatlines
at Pe 1⁄4 1 at Rk 1⁄4 100 in contrast to that at Rk 1⁄4 0:05. Further, in the
left half of the channel, heat transfer occurs almost horizontally
through the fluid to the left wall as the thermal conductivity of the
fluid is significantly high at Rk 1⁄4 100. Also, due to the presence of
the cold regime, the heatlines are sparse involving less heatfunction
gradients at the left half as seen from Fig. 8(b). As Pe increases fur-
ther (Pe 1⁄4 5), the region of the dense heat flow moves towards the
hot right wall as seen from the highly dense heatlines near that
region for Pe 1⁄4 5 at Rk 1⁄4 100 compared to Rk 1⁄4 0:05 (see the right
panel plots of Fig. 8(a and b)). Overall, the path of the heat flow in
the channel is highly affected by Peclet number (Pe) for all cases
[42]. Also, the increase or decrease of the heat transfer rate may be
estimated from the dimensionless heat transfer rate using heatfunc-
tion values for all cases [42]. The heatlines are proved to be the use-
ful tool to depict the heat flow in channels involving fluid, porous
and partially filled porous media.

4. Application of heatlines for natural or mixed convection
within cavities

4.1. Natural convection in enclosures in the presence of various hot wall
(s)

P4.1.1. Enclosures with hot wall, cold wall and adiabatic wall(s)-
differential or Rayleigh-B(cid:1)enard heating (Type 1)

PType 1a
PKimura and Bejan [28] employed ‘heatlines’ to visualize natural
convection in a differentially heated square enclosure (Fig. 2(I)(a)).
The governing heatfunction equation (Eq. (50)) with the appropriate
heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 1a of Table 1) was
solved numerically using Allen-Southwell finite difference scheme.
The figures are not shown for the brevity of the review. However,
the qualitative features of heatlines will be addressed as follows. At
the low Ra (Ra 1⁄4 140), the heatlines are found to be orthogonal to
the isotherms depicting the conduction dominant heat transfer. At R
a 1⁄4 1:4 (cid:5) 106; the intense convective heat circulation cells are
observed apart from convective end-to-end heatlines within the
square enclosure. The shape of the heatlines near the core is found
to be identical with the streamlines, signifying the convection domi-
nant heat flow and high thermal mixing at Ra 1⁄4 1:4 (cid:5) 106. The
stronger thermal gradients are found especially along the upper por-
tion of the right wall and the lower portion of the left wall. This can
also be explained based on the strong heatfunction gradient along
those zones. It may be noted that, convection heat transfer is mostly
dominant near the core of the enclosure based on the presence of
the closed loop heatlines whereas the heat transfer is conduction
dominant especially near the walls and that can be explained based
on the end-to-end heatlines. Overall, the pioneering work by Kimura
and Bejan [28] depicted that, the heatline patterns are useful in visu-
alizing the convective heat transfer process within the square enclo-
sure. Similar works have also been carried out in order to visualize
convective heat flow within differentially heated square enclosures
involving fluid media [47(cid:1)49].

PWaheed [50] investigated natural convection within a differen-
tially heated porous square enclosure for a wide range of Rayleigh
number (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106) at Darcy number, Da 1⁄4 0:01 and Prandtl
number, Pr 1⁄4 0:01 (Fig. 2(I)(a)). The heatfunction equation (Eq. (59))
along with the prescribed boundary conditions (see type 1a of
Table 1) was solved using the finite-difference scheme. The heatlines
are almost parallel to the horizontal walls and those are orthogonal
to the isotherms at the low Ra (Ra 1⁄4 103) depicting the dominance
of conduction heat transfer (see Fig. 9(i)(a)). At Ra 1⁄4 105; intense
heatline cells are found to occur near the core depicting the high

Pthermal mixing (see Fig. 9(ii)(a)). The high convective effect results
in compressed isotherms especially near the lower half of the left
wall and upper half of the right wall. This can be further explained
based on the dense heatlines near those zones (see Fig. 9(ii)(a)). On
the other hand, sparse heatlines near the upper portion of the left
wall and lower portion of the right wall signify comparatively lesser
amount of heat transfer (see Fig. 9(ii)(a)). This can also be explained
based on the lesser temperature gradients near the upper portion of
the left wall and lower portion of the right wall. Overall, the heat-
lines provide an effective way to identify the conduction dominant
or convection heat flow circulation zones within the differentially
heated square cavity for various Ra.

PNatural convection of nanofluids (copper-water) within differen-
tially heated square enclosures (Fig. 2(I)(a)) have been investigated
based on the heatlines by Basak and Chamkha [80] for the base fluid
as water. The Galerkin finite element method was employed to solve
the heatfunction equation (see Eq. (59)) using the heatfunction
boundary condition (see Section 2.4.3 and Eqs. (70a) and (70b)).
The numerical results have been illustrated in terms of the stream-
lines,
isotherms and heatlines for various Rayleigh numbers
(103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 105) and volume fractions of nanoparticle (f 1⁄4 0:1 and
0.2) in the base fluid (water). The qualitative trends of results are
similar to Fig. 9(i)(a) and (ii)(a) and the detailed illustrations of the
results are omitted for the brevity. The results are first discussed for
f 1⁄4 0:1 and various Ra. At Ra 1⁄4 103; the streamlines with compara-
tively larger intensity are observed for water (base fluid) than those
for nanofluid (Figures not shown). The isotherms are almost parallel
to the side walls and those are slightly distorted near the core for
water and nanofluid at Ra 1⁄4 103. The isotherms at the core are more
curved and distorted for water compared to nanofluid at Ra 1⁄4 103.
The closed loop heatlines are observed for water depicting the initia-
tion of the convective heat flow whereas, the end-to-end heatlines
depict conductive heat flow for nanofluids at Ra 1⁄4 103. As Ra
increases to 105, the intensity of convection is largely enhanced as
the convective cells for the heatlines appear both for water and
nanofluids (Figures not shown). However, in contrast to the lower
Ra, it is observed that, the diameter and size of the heatline cells for
nanofluid are quite larger than those for water at Ra 1⁄4 105 (Figures
not shown). Note that, the dense heatlines occur at the bottom por-
tion of the left wall and top portion of the right wall both for nano-
fluid and water especially at Ra 1⁄4 105. However, the heatfunction
gradient along the walls is found to be slightly higher for nanofluid
compared to those for water at Ra 1⁄4 105 (Figures not shown). Thus,
stronger compression of isotherms is observed along the top portion
of the right wall and bottom portion of the left wall for nanofluid
compared to water. The effect of nanofluid fraction (f) has been
clearly illustrated for the various regimes for Ra (Figures not shown).
At f 1⁄4 0:2; the intensity of the streamfunction is largely decreased
and the isotherms are parallel vertical lines in the presence of nano-
fluids at the low Ra. The heatlines for nanofluid are almost straight
horizontal lines connecting the side walls and those are almost par-
allel to the adiabatic walls at the low Ra depicting greater dominance
of conduction at f 1⁄4 0:2 compared to f 1⁄4 0:1 (Figures not shown).
Due to the greater dominance of the buoyancy force over viscous
force at Ra 1⁄4 105 with f 1⁄4 0:2; the intensity of the heatline cell is
found to be significantly higher compared to f 1⁄4 0:1 and water.
Thus, the heatline concept is found to be effective in explaining the
difference in energy flow behavior for various volume fractions (f)
of nanofluids inside the square cavity.

PBasak et al. [51,52] carried out heatline studies in the differen-
tially heated tilted square enclosure involving the porous [51] and
fluid [52] media (Fig. 2(I)(b)). The heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) is
solved using the Galerkin finite element method with the appropri-
ate heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 1a of Table 1). In
order to maintain the brevity of the review, the results for the fluid
media [52] are discussed. The numerical studies were carried out for

streamfunctions and heatfunctions decrease with ’ at the low Ra in
contrast to those at the high Ra where the intensities of streamfunc-
tions and heatfunctions increase with ’. At Ra 1⁄4 103; the end-to-
end heatlines and convective heatline cells are found to occur in the

in
Fig. 9(i)(b). Consequently, the isotherms are smooth and they are

almost parallel to the side walls for ’ 1⁄4 60
(Fig. 9(i)(b)). On the
other hand, the isotherms are found to be slightly distorted near the
central regime of the cavities involving ’ 1⁄4 15
and 30° (Figures not
shown). As Ra increases to 105, the heatline cells span almost the
entire central core of the cavity and those lead to the significant
recirculation of heat near the core of the enclosure especially for the
higher ’’s. Hence, a large zone near the central core is maintained at
the uniform temperature at Ra 1⁄4 105 for the higher ’’s. Due to the
enhanced thermal mixing at Ra 1⁄4 105; a large mixing zone is
observed at the core and the isotherms are found to be largely com-
pressed especially towards the central portion of the side walls (see
Fig. 9(ii)(b)). It is also found that the intensity of the heatline cells is

Pfurther enhanced inside the cavity for the higher Pr, irrespective of ’
(Figures not shown). Consequently, the thermal mixing is largely
enhanced near the core of the cavity for all ’s compared to
Pr 1⁄4 0:025. Overall, the heatlines demonstrate the trajectories of the
conductive heatlines at the lower Ra whereas the major portion of
the cavity involves the heat flow due to the convective circulation

Pdepicting the heat flow from the hotter to cooler part of the wall. The
strong thermal gradient is observed along the lower half of the left
wall based on the presence of the dense heatlines (Figures not

shown). At Ra 1⁄4 105 and ’ 1⁄4 0
formed near the central core of the enclosure and that results in sig-
nificant thermal mixing. Consequently, isotherms are largely dis-
torted and compressed towards the lower half of the left wall. It may
be noted that, the strength of the fluid and heat flow increases with
B; the
nanoparticle volume fraction. As the cavity is tilted at ’ 1⁄4 30
heatlines are clustered along the lower half of the left wall (Figures
not shown). In addition, the convective heatline cells are found to
span the entire central zone of the enclosure. Consequently, the cen-
tral portion of the enclosure is maintained at the uniform tempera-
ture and the isotherms are strongly compressed towards the lower
portion of the left wall resulting in the formation of the strong tem-
perature gradient (Figures not shown). At the higher ’, the strength
as well as size of the heatline cells is observed to be further
enhanced leading to the higher thermal mixing (Figures not shown).
Overall, the heatline concept is successfully demonstrated to illus-
trate the effect of inclination angles on the path and intensity of
convective heat flow in nanofluids.

PCosta et al. [53] carried out a numerical study for laminar natural
convection heat transfer occurring in a vertical stack of differentially
heated parallellogrammic (Fig. 2(I)(c)) partial enclosures and
reported the thermal diode effect on the thermal performance of the
enclosure. The heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) was solved using the
heatfunction boundary condition (see type 1a of Table 1). The results
were obtained for fluids with Pr 1⁄4 0:73 at Ra 1⁄4 107 for various incli-
nation angles of the parallellogrammic enclosure with the horizontal
B; § 30° and § 60°) and two different enclosure aspect

However, in the parallellogrammic enclosures (’ 1⁄4 § 30
the heatline circulation cells are observed in each partition (Figures
not shown). In addition, the heat flow within the enclosure is also
demonstrated via the end-to-end convective heatlines which ema-
nate from the lower portion of the left wall and end to the right wall
in each panel (Figures not shown). Note that, for the inclination
B; § 60°, the inclined heat circulation cells of higher
angles, ’ 1⁄4 § 30
magnitudes are observed in each partition for A 1⁄4 0:2. As the enclo-
sure aspect ratio (A) increases to 0.5, the dense heatlines are
observed near the lower half of the hot wall and along the upper half
of the cold wall. Consequently, strong temperature gradient is
observed along the lower half of the left wall and upper half of the
right wall (Figures not shown). Overall, the heatlines are demon-
strated to explain the effects of various inclination angles on the
intensity and trajectory of the heat flow within the parallellogram-
mic enclosure.

PAnandalakshmi and Basak [54,55] analyzed the steady laminar
natural convective flow within differentially heated rhombic cav-
ities (Fig. 2(I)(c)) for fluid [54] and porous media [55]. In order
to maintain the brevity of the review, the discussions on the
heatlines and isotherms of the fluid media [54] are presented for
various inclination angles (’) over a wide range of Rayleigh num-
ber, Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105 and Prandtl number, Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 1000. The
Galerkin finite element method was used to solve the heatfunction
equation (Eq. (59)) using the appropriate heatfunction boundary
conditions (see type 1a of Table 1). As expected, the heat transfer is
B
conduction dominant for the lower ’’s (’ 1⁄4 30
and 45°) at Ra 1⁄4
103 irrespective of Pr based on the parallel and smooth heatlines
B
(see Fig. 9(i)(c) for ’ 1⁄4 45
). In addition, the isotherms are found to
be orthogonal to the heatlines demonstrating the dominance of
conduction at the low Ra. The closed loop heatlines and slightly
distorted isotherms are found at the core for ’ 1⁄4 75
and 90° (Fig-
ures not shown) for all Pr even at Ra 1⁄4 103. At Ra 1⁄4 105; multiple

B

Pflow circulations are observed at Pr 1⁄4 0:015 for all ’’s (see Fig. 9(ii)
B
). It may be noted that, the primary fluid and heat
(c) for ’ 1⁄4 45
B
circulation cells span almost 90% of the enclosure for ’ 1⁄4 90
. Con-
sequently, the thermal mixing is found to be higher near the cen-
B
tral core of the enclosure with ’ 1⁄4 90
(Figures not shown)
compared to the other ’’s. The isotherms of Fig. 9(ii)(c) at Ra 1⁄4 105
depict that the thermal boundary layer thickness is lesser near the
central portion of the side walls whereas, the thermal boundary
layer is found to be greater near the lower and upper portions of
the side walls. The multiple convective heatline circulation cells
transport heat locally in various zones at Pr 1⁄4 0:015 and Ra 1⁄4 105.
Multiple circulation cells are suppressed and single flow circula-
tion cells are found to occupy the entire cavity at the higher Pr val-
ues (0.7, 7.2 and 1000) for all ’’s (Figures not shown). Interesting
features on the heatlines further illustrate that the direct heat
transport to the cold wall is rare, but the cold wall receives heat via
the convective heat circulation cells for all ’’s especially at ’ (cid:2) 45°
in both cases irrespective of Pr at Ra 1⁄4 105. Overall, the effects of
various geometrical and thermal parameters on the convective
heat flow is visualized efficiently via the heatlines.

PCosta [56] numerically studied the double-diffusive natural
convection in a differentially heated parallellogrammic enclo-
sures (Fig. 2(I)(c)) filled with moist air for various parameters
(buoyancy ratio: 1 (cid:3) Bu (cid:3) 10, Ra 1⁄4 105 and aspect ratio D 0.5) for
two different cases: (i) case 1: combined global heat and mass
flows, (ii) case 2: opposite global heat and mass flows. The heat-
function equation (Eq. (59)) was solved using the heatfunction
boundary conditions given in Table 1 (see type 1a of Table 1). The
numerical method used in this work is an adaptation of a two-
dimensional laminar version of the control-volume-based finite
element method. At Bu 1⁄4 1; a large heatline cell is observed at the
core depicting the dominance of convection at Ra 1⁄4 105. Due to
the greater thermal mixing near the central core, the isotherms are
largely compressed towards the side walls resulting in the high
temperature gradient at Bu 1⁄4 1 and Ra 1⁄4 105 for case 1 (Figures
not shown). As Bu increases to 10, the intensity and size of the
heatline cell are increased leading to the enhanced thermal mixing
at the core for case 1. The heatline features for case 2 clearly illus-
trate that the heatlines emanating from the left wall travel through
the bottom half of the cavity and end at the right wall (Figures not
shown). This contrasts the heatline features for case 1 where it was
observed that, the heatlines emerging from the left wall travel
through the top half of the cavity before ending at the right wall. In
contrast to case 1, the heat flow occurs through the lower half of
the cavity for case 2 (Figures not shown). In addition, relatively
weaker heatline cells occur near the left wall for case 2. Due to the
presence of the heatline cells near the left wall, the end-to-end
heatlines are compressed near the upper half of the left wall for
case 2 (Figures not shown). Overall, the heatlines clearly illustrate
various heat flow patterns within the parallellogrammic cavity and
these heatline patterns form the basis of thermal management
which can be triggered via parameters in cases 1 and 2.

PRamakrishna et al. [57,58] studied natural convection for the
fluid and porous media within trapezoidal cavities and illustrations
are shown for the fluid media [57]. Ramakrishna et al. [57] carried

to ’ 1⁄4 30
heatline cells, the larger amount of heat is recirculated near the core
of the enclosure and that further results in the compression of the
isotherms especially towards the central portion of the side walls of
the enclosures for Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (see Fig. 9(ii)(d)). It may be noted that,
the isotherms are slightly distorted near the upper left and right cor-
ner regions of the enclosure due to the presence of the tiny second-
ary heatline cells at Ra 1⁄4 105 (see Fig. 9(ii)(d)). At the higher Pr
(Pr 1⁄4 7:2), the heatlines near the wall are found to be almost parallel
and the heatline cells take the shape of the cavity, irrespective of ’
(Figures not shown). It may be noted that, the intensity of the heat-
line cells is found to be increased at Pr 1⁄4 7:2 compared to that at
Pr 1⁄4 0:015. It is interesting to observe that, the heatline cell within
the square enclosure (’ 1⁄4 90

PAlsabery et al. [82] used the heatline concept to visualize the con-
vective heat flow within a differentially heated trapezoidal cavity
(Fig. 2(I)(d)) partly filled with nanofluid porous layer and partly with
non-Newtonian fluid. The study was carried out for Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1)
13:4; 0.3 (cid:3) S (cid:3) 0.7 (S: porous layer thickness), 0.6 (cid:3) n (cid:3) 1.4 (n:
power-law index), 0° (cid:3) ’ (cid:3) 21.8° (’: the side wall inclination angle),
0° (cid:3) ’c (cid:3) 90° (’c: cavity inclination angle) and f 1⁄4 0 and 0.05 (f:
nanofluid volume fraction) at Ra 1⁄4 105 and Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3. The heat-
function equation (see Eq. (59)) subjected to the heatfunction
boundary conditions (see type 1a of Table 1) was solved numerically
based on the finite volume method using a collocated grid system.
At Pr 1⁄4 0:015; the heat circulation cell takes an oval shape and that
occurs near the lower half of the cavity for both f 1⁄4 0 and 0.05 (Fig-
ures not shown). As Pr increases to 13.4, the unicellular heatline cells
span almost 80% of the entire cavity indicating the large thermal
mixing at the core and consequently, the intensity is found to be
higher compared to the low Pr. Note that, common to all Pr, the cir-
culation intensity is found to be higher for f 1⁄4 0:05 due to the larger
thermal conductivity of nanofluid compared to f 1⁄4 0 (Figures not
shown). Interesting features of the heatlines are achieved for various
values of S. Note that, the lower S (S 1⁄4 0:3) corresponds to the higher
thickness of the non-Newtonian fluid layer. It is observed that, the
heatline circulation cell is restricted along the non-Newtonian fluid
layer at S 1⁄4 0:3; irrespective of f. As S increases to 0.5 and 0.7, the
heatline cell is found to diminish in size and finally disappears for
both f (Figures not shown). Hence, at S 1⁄4 0:7; the heat transport is
dominated by conduction based on the presence of the end-to-end
heatlines connecting the hot and cold walls. The effect of n is also
demonstrated and it is found that the intensity of the heatline cells
B;
grows stronger for both f as n increases from 0.6 to 1.4. At ’ 1⁄4 0
the irregularly shaped heatline cell is observed for both f. As ’ (the
side wall inclination angle) increases from 0° to 21.8°, the heatline
cell is found to expand diagonally and consequently, the heat flow is
found to be enhanced from the left wall to the upper portion of the
right wall for both f. Common to all f, the strength of the heatline
cell is found to be higher for f 1⁄4 0:05 compared to f 1⁄4 0 (Figures
(cavity inclination angle), the heat flow
not shown). At fc 1⁄4 30

Poccurs through the upper half of the enclosure and the heatline cells
span a larger zone near the lower half (Figures not shown). As ’c
increases to 90°, the heat flow is found to occur in the lower half of
the cavity as depicted by the end-to-end heatlines and the heatline
cells are slightly shifted towards the upper half, irrespective of f
(Figures not shown). Finally, the visualization of convective heat
flow within the differentially heated trapezoidal cavity consisting of
porous media, nanofluid and non-Newtonian fluid is efficiently dem-
onstrated via the heatlines (Figures not shown).

PBiswal and Basak [59] carried out the numerical computations
within the differentially heated enclosures involving curved side
walls at various Prandtl numbers (Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 1000) for various
Rayleigh numbers (Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 106) involving various cases based on
the convexity/concavity of the curved side walls (Fig. 2(I)(e and f)).
The left wall of the enclosure is maintained isothermally hot and the
right wall is maintained isothermally cold along with insulated hori-
zontal wall. Eq. (59) was solved using the Galerkin finite element
method with the appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions (see
type 1a of Table 1). Comparative studies of the concave and convex
cases show that the heat and flow distributions are affected signifi-
cantly by the wall curvature for the concave cases. The significant
variations in the thermal and flow characteristics are not observed
for various wall curvatures for the convex cases. At the low Ra, the
end-to-end heatlines and smooth isotherms are observed in the
enclosure for the concave cases (see Fig. 9(i)(e)), whereas in the con-
vex cases, the end-to-end heatlines along with the closed loop heat-
lines and slightly distorted isotherms are observed even at the low
Ra (see Fig. 9(i)(f)). As the wall curvature increases, the magnitudes
of the streamlines and intensity of the closed loop heatlines are
found to be decreased in the concave cases (Figures not shown). On
the other hand, the increase in the wall curvature in the convex
cases results in the enhancement of magnitudes of the streamlines
and closed loop heatlines. At Ra 1⁄4 105 and Pr 1⁄4 0:015; the second-
ary fluid and heatline circulation cells are observed within the enclo-
sure along the concave wall (see Fig. 9(ii)(e)). In contrast, the single
fluid flow and heatline circulation cells are observed throughout the
enclosure except at the corner zones for all the cases of convexities
at Ra 1⁄4 105 and Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (see Fig. 9(ii)(f)). At the low Ra, the larger
heat transfer rate is observed for the concave cases whereas the heat
transfer rate is found to be significantly larger in the convex cases at
the high Ra for all Pr. Overall, the heatlines clearly illustrate that the
heat flow patterns largely depend on the curvature of the side walls.

PType 1b
PKaluri et al. [60] and Anandalakshmi et al. [61] carried out the
detailed analysis on the role of the aspect ratio and thermal bound-
ary conditions on natural convection heat flow within right angled
triangular enclosures involving the fluid and porous media (Fig. 2(I)
(g)] and the results for the porous media are presented as the repre-
sentative cases. The numerical results were obtained for various
B; 30° and
fluid properties (Pr 1⁄4 0:015 and 0.7), top angles (’ 1⁄4 15
45°) and porosities (Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)5 (cid:1) 10(cid:1)3) at Ra 1⁄4 5 (cid:5) 105 [61]. The
Galerkin finite element method was used in order to solve the heat-
function equation (Eq. (59)) using the appropriate heatfunction
boundary conditions (see type 1b of Table 1). The heatline and iso-
therm characteristics of the representative case involving the iso-
thermally cold left and hot right walls and adiabatic bottom wall for
Pr 1⁄4 0:015 and Pr 1⁄4 0:7 at Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3 are shown in Fig. 10(i and ii)
(a) [61]. At Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)5; the heatlines are observed to be smooth and
almost parallel to the bottom wall indicating the conduction domi-
nant heat transfer within the cavity for all the values of ’ (Figures
not shown). At Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3; the convection is significantly enhanced
due to the increase in intensity of flow circulation and the heatlines
are found to take curved shapes signifying heat circulations indicat-
ing the convection dominant heat transfer for Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (see Fig. 10
(i)(a)) and 0.7 (see Fig. 10(ii)(a)). Note that, the thermal mixing is
enhanced due to the intense convection at the higher Da (see Fig. 10

P(i and ii)(a)). It is interesting to observe that for the higher Pr
(Pr 1⁄4 0:7), the intense heatline cell recirculates large amount of heat
from the right wall to the left wall and that further results in the
greater temperature gradient especially along the upper portion of
the left wall and lower half of the right wall (see Fig. 10(ii)(a)). Also,
the thermal mixing zone near the central core of the cavities is found
to be significantly enhanced for Pr 1⁄4 0:7 compared to Pr 1⁄4 0:015.
The effects of the thermal boundary conditions and top angle on the
heat flow patterns are clearly visualized via the heatlines. Kaluri
et al. [60] and Anandalakshmi et al. [61] also studied the convective
heat flow via the heatlines for different sets of thermal boundary
conditions. The detailed explanations on the heat flow via the heat-
lines for all the boundary conditions can be explained in a similar
manner and hence, they are excluded in order to maintain the brev-
ity of the review.

PBasak et al. [62] analyzed natural convection in a porous right
angled triangular enclosure with a convex/concave hypotenuse
(Fig. 2(I)(h), (i)). The cavity is subjected to the isothermal cold left
wall, isothermal hot curved right wall, and adiabatic bottom wall
(Fig. 2(I)(h), (i)). The Galerkin finite element method was used in
order to solve the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) using the appro-
priate heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 1b of Table 1).
The numerical studies were carried out for a wide range of Darcy
number (Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)5 (cid:1) 10) and Prandtl number (Pr 1⁄4 0:01 (cid:1) 7:2) at a
fixed Rayleigh number (Ra 1⁄4 106) and the results have been illus-
trated via the isotherms and heatlines. The end-to-end heatlines are
observed to be smooth and parallel to the bottom wall indicating the
conduction dominant heat transfer within the cavity at the low Da
for both the concave and convex hypotenuses involving all Pr. The
heatline circulation cells with very less magnitudes are found at the
bottom portion of the enclosure (concave and convex) at the low Da
for all Pr [62]. The magnitudes of heatfunction are significantly high
at the top edge of the enclosure due to the temperature singularity
at the hot-cold junction. At the high Da (Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)2), the intensity as

Pwell as size of the heatline circulation cell is significant for both the
concave (see Fig. 10(i)(b)) and convex (see Fig. 10(i)(c)) cases involv-
ing Pr 1⁄4 0:01. Note that, multiple heatline cells occur for the concave
case (see Fig. 10(i)(b)) in contrast to the convex case (see Fig. 10(i)
(c)) for Pr 1⁄4 0:01 [62]. It is also found that, the multiple heatlines are
effective in enhancing the local thermal mixing within the cavity.
The isotherms of Fig. 10(i)(b) and (c) signify that the temperature
gradient is increased along the left and curved walls for Pr 1⁄4 0:01 at
Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)2 compared to the low Da. At Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)2 and Pr 1⁄4 0:7; the
heatline circulation cells are further intense and they span almost
the entire cavity for both the concave and convex cases at high Pr
(Pr 1⁄4 0:7 and 7.2) indicating the high thermal mixing (see Fig. 10(ii)
(b) and (c)). Due to the enhanced thermal mixing, the isotherms are
strongly compressed towards the side walls for both the concave
and convex cases (see Fig. 10(ii)(b) and (c)) at the high Pr (Pr 1⁄4 0:7)
compared to Pr 1⁄4 0:01. Thus, the heatlines demonstrate how to reg-
ulate or promote the local convective heat flow circulation or global
heat circulation cells for the hot concave/convex wall involving vari-
ous fluid (Pr 1⁄4 0:01 (cid:1) 7:2) within the porous medium.

PType 1c
PBello-Ochende [63] carried out the study of natural convection
within a square cavity subjected to Rayleigh-B(cid:1)enard heating
(Fig. 2(I)(j)) via the heatline approach for a range of Ra
(0.5 £ Racr (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 8 £ Racr; Racr is the critical Rayleigh number and
that corresponds to 1708) at Pr 1⁄4 0:7. A modified form of the non-
dimensional heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (50) with the
heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 1c of Table 1) was solved
using the central finite difference method. During the B(cid:1)enard type
configuration, the subcritical (0.5 £ Racr), threshold or critical (Racr)
and postcritical (8 £ Racr) values of Ra can be determined. At subcrit-
ical Ra, the weak unicellular fluid circulation cell with the lesser
intensity is observed (Figures not shown). Thus, the heatline trajec-
tories are found to be almost parallel the adiabatic vertical walls due
to the greater dominance of conduction. At the critical Ra, the

Pintensity of the fluid circulation cells is largely increased and the
heatlines are found to be slightly distorted at the central core region
(Figures not shown). As the intensity of convection gradually
increases above the threshold state, the heatline patterns tend to
show signs of symmetric clustering about the vertical mid-section of
the enclosure. At 8 £ Racr, two distinct apparently centrosymmetric
heatline patterns emerge indicating the existence of identical energy
flow patterns. Overall, almost similar heatline and streamline cells
occur at the core of the cavity for the higher Ra depicting the domi-
nance of the convective heat transfer (Figures not shown). The con-
vective heat flow path from the bottom to top surface during
Rayleigh(cid:1)B(cid:1)enard convection is efficiently visualized via the heat-
lines. ‘Heatlines’ play the lead role to demonstrate the path of the
heat flow to depict a portion near the side walls involving the paral-
lel heat flow trajectories and another zone involving the convective
heat flow circulation. The different characteristics of the heatline tra-
jectories can be thermally managed based on critical, postcritical and
subcritical Rayleigh numbers.

PTwo-dimensional steady-state Rayleigh(cid:1)B(cid:1)enard convection of
thermodependent power-law fluids confined in a square cavity
(Fig. 2(I)(j)) was conducted numerically by Kaddiri et al. [64]. The
dimensional form of the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) subjected
to the different dimensional forms of heatfunction boundary condi-
tions [64] (similar to type 1c of Table 1) was solved using the second
order central finite difference method. The effects of the governing
parameters such as Pearson number [Pearson number (m) measures
the effect of temperature change on the effective viscosity; m 1⁄4 0
and 10], the flow behavior index (0.6 (cid:3) fn (cid:3) 1.4), and Rayleigh num-
ber (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 105) on the flow onset, flow structure, and heat
transfer were examined. Note that, the values of fn are selected so
that they can represent the shear-thinning (0 < fn < 1), Newtonian
(fn 1⁄4 1), and shear-thickening (fn > 1) cases. The results are first dis-
cussed for m 1⁄4 0. The streamline features at m 1⁄4 0 demonstrate
that the flow circulation cells spread over the entire square enclo-
sure irrespective of fn and Ra [64]. Note that, the end-to-end heat-
lines are almost parallel lines to the adiabatic walls especially for
103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 3 £ 103 corresponding to m 1⁄4 0 irrespective of fn and Ra.
At m 1⁄4 0; the isotherms are found to be parallel near the walls
except near the central core region of the cavity especially for fn 1⁄4
0:6 and 1 involving lower values of Ra. However, at the higher Ra,
the intensity of the convective flow is found to be enhanced as
depicted by the intense convective heatlines which lead to the dis-
torted isotherms to occur near the central core region of the enclo-
sure for m 1⁄4 0 irrespective of fn (Figures not shown). The results are
next discussed for m 1⁄4 10. The streamlines are intensified and
crowded in the region near the lower left corner region of the cavity
at m 1⁄4 10 especially at the low Ra irrespective of fn. However, at the
high Ra, the eye of the streamline vortex is found to be slightly
shifted upward towards the central regime of the cavity irrespective
of fn [64]. In contrast to m 1⁄4 0; the convective heatline circulation
cells are found to occur near the lower central core of the square
enclosure at m 1⁄4 10 involving fn 1⁄4 0:6 and 1, irrespective of Ra. It
may be noted that, the convective heatline cell spans slightly greater
area in the lower half of the cavity for fn 1⁄4 0:6 compared to fn 1⁄4 1 at
m 1⁄4 10 irrespective of Ra (Figures not shown). Thus, the end-to-end
heatlines involve many undulations leading to the larger path to
transport heat from the hot to cold wall. As fn increases beyond 1
(fn 1⁄4 1:4), the convective heatline cells disappear and only the end-
to-end heatlines are found to occur within 3 £ 103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 5 £ 104 for
m 1⁄4 10 (Figures not shown). However, a tiny heatline cell is formed
near the lower portion of the cavity at Ra 1⁄4 105 for m 1⁄4 10 involv-
ing fn 1⁄4 1:4 (Figures not shown). Overall, the heatline demonstrates
how rheological property of fluid (fn) and Pearson number (m) would
promote or suppress various complex structures of convective heat
flow trajectories which can be used to maintain temperature levels
for various thermal processing applications.

PRaji et al. [65] reported numerical results of natural convection
within an air filled square cavity subjected to periodic cooling from
the top wall in the presence of the hot bottom wall and adiabatic
vertical walls (Fig. 2(I)(j)) for Ra 1⁄4 106 and 0 (cid:3) a (cid:3) 0.8 (a D ampli-
tude ratio). The heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) with various
heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 1c of Table 1) was dis-
cretized and solved using a second order accurate finite difference
method. The heatline features are discussed only for a 1⁄4 0:175 and
0.4. At the lower a (a 1⁄4 0:175), multiple heatline cells along with the
end-to-end heatlines are observed within the square cavity (Figures
not shown). The primary heatline cells span almost 80% of the entire
square cavity and the secondary heatline circulation cells occur near
the upper left and lower right corner regions of the enclosure at a 1⁄4
0:175 (Figures not shown). Due to the large primary heatline cells
near the central core, the thermal mixing is largely enhanced near
the central core. Hence, a large zone of the temperature uniformity
is observed near the central core of the cavity. As a increases to 0.4,
two large primary heatline cells are found to occur near the lower
and upper halves of the enclosure (Figures not shown). Conse-
quently, two distinct zones of temperature uniformity are observed
near the upper and lower halves. In addition, the heatlines emanat-
ing from the bottom wall travel a larger path to reach the top cold
wall for a 1⁄4 0:4 compared to a 1⁄4 0:175 (Figures not shown). Overall,
the heatlines demonstrate the role of the amplitude ratio on the
management of various patterns of convection heat flow and ther-
mal mixing.

PDhar et al. [66] carried out unsteady state natural convection
studies during the solidification of an aqueous ammonium chloride
solution in a rectangular cavity subjected to Rayleigh(cid:1)B(cid:1)enard heat-
ing (Fig. 2(I)(j)). The dimensional
the heatfunction
equation (Eq. (59)) and heatfunction boundary conditions (similar to
type 1c of Table 1) were solved using the finite volume method. The
results are presented in terms of the heatlines over a wide range of
time (t 1⁄4 10; 50 and 250 min). At t 1⁄4 10 min, a number of closed
loop heatline cells occur as the cavity is mostly filled with liquid. It is
interesting to observe that the heatline cells expand mostly near the
core of the enclosure (Figures not shown). As t increases to 50 and
250 min, the size of the heatline cells is reduced and the cells are
shifted towards the bottom wall of the enclosure (Figures not
shown). In addition, the heatlines become straight due to the domi-
nance of conduction within the cavity at the higher t. This may be
explained based on the fact that, as time progresses, the liquid
within the cavity undergoes solidification process (Figures not
shown). Overall, the results clearly demonstrate that heatlines can
be used to understand the heat transport and associated physics of
solidification.

PThe heatline method was also adopted by Anandalakshmi and
Basak [54,55] in order to analyze natural convection heat transfer
within fluid [54] and porous [55] media filled rhombic enclosure for
various inclination angles (’) subjected to Rayleigh(cid:1)B(cid:1)enard heating
strategy (Fig. 2(I)(k)). In order to maintain the brevity of review, the
numerical results are only discussed for the fluid filled rhombic
enclosure [54]. The numerical studies were carried out for a wide
range of Ra, Pr and ’. The Galerkin finite element was employed in
order to solve the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) using various
heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 1c of Table 1). At Ra 1⁄4
103; the heatlines are found to be slightly distorted near the middle
portion of the cavity especially for the lower ’’s whereas, the heat-
lines are found to be almost straight lines parallel to the side walls at
higher ’’s (Figures not shown). Consequently, uniform temperature
gradients are observed almost throughout the domain at higher ’’s
except near the top right and bottom left corners of the cavity where
the poor heat distribution is observed. At Ra 1⁄4 105; the intense heat-
line cells are observed within all the enclosures. The size and magni-
tude of the closed loop primary heatline cells increase with ’
(Figures not shown). It is also observed that, the secondary heatline

Pcell near the left bottom corner region of the cavity disappears at the
higher ’. Due to the intense heat circulation near the core, a large
zone near the central core is maintained at uniform temperature,
especially for ’ 1⁄4 75
and 90° (Figures not shown). Consequently,
the isotherms are found to be largely compressed along the horizon-
tal walls. Interesting features at the higher Pr (Pr 1⁄4 1000) depict
that the heatlines are highly distorted and the closed loop heatlines
almost fill the entire cavity especially at larger ’’s (Figures not
shown). As a result, a large portion of the central zone of the cavity
is maintained at uniform temperature especially for ’ 1⁄4 75
and
90°. Overall, the heatline approach highlights the role of rhombic to
square cavities for the evolution of various sizes of convective heat-
line cells which will be important for thermal processing during Ray-
leigh-B(cid:1)enard heating.

P4.1.2. Enclosures with multiple hot or cold walls and one adiabatic wall
(Type 2)

PType 2a
PBasak and Roy [35] investigated the role of heatlines in order
to visualize the heat flow within the square enclosure involving
uniformly heated bottom wall along with cold side walls and
(Fig. 2(II)(a)). The Galerkin finite element
adiabatic top wall
method was implemented to solve the heatfunction governing
equation (Eq. (59)) with the various heatfunction boundary condi-
tions (see type 2a of Table 1). The results are first illustrated for
Pr 1⁄4 0:026 for a wide range of Ra (Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105). Due to the uni-
form heating of the bottom wall, buoyancy forces are induced and

Pthe fluid rises vertically near the middle portion of the bottom wall.
Further, fluid falls down along the cold vertical walls resulting in the
formation of counter-clockwise fluid circulation cells. At the low Ra
(Ra 1⁄4 103) and Pr 1⁄4 0:026; the heatlines clearly illustrate that the
bottom portion of the cold side walls receives the significant amount
of the heat from the hot wall (see Fig. 11(i)(a)). On the other hand,
the top portion of the cavity remains cool due to the less transport of
heat from the bottom wall as depicted by the sparse heatlines (see
Fig. 11(i)(a)) for Pr 1⁄4 0:026. Overall, the temperature gradient along
the side walls is relatively weak and the thermal boundary layer
thickness gradually increases from the lower to the upper half of the
side walls for Pr 1⁄4 0:026 (see Fig. 11(i)(a)). As Ra increases to 105,
the intense multiple convective fluid and heat circulation cells are
found to occur for Pr 1⁄4 0:026 (see Fig. 11(ii)(a)). Note that, the pri-
mary heat circulation cells circulate large amount of heat near the
upper half of the square enclosure and consequently, the upper cen-
tral core of the square enclosure is maintained at uniform tempera-
ture corresponding to u 1⁄4 0:1 (cid:1) 0:3 for Pr 1⁄4 0:026 (see Fig. 11(ii)
(a)). In addition, the dense heatlines are found to occur especially
along the upper portion of the cold side walls and hence, the thick-
ness of the thermal boundary layer is largely reduced near the upper
cold side walls for Pr 1⁄4 0:026 and Ra 1⁄4 105 (see Fig. 11(ii)(a)). Note
that, the isotherms near the bottom wall are found to be distorted
due to the presence of the tiny secondary heat circulation cells for Pr
1⁄4 0:026 (see Fig. 11(ii)(a)). As Pr increases to 0.7 and 1000, the sec-
ondary circulations disappear and the strength of the fluid and heat
circulation cells is found to be further enhanced within the square

Penclosure (Figures not shown). Due to the enhanced convection, the
intense heat circulation cells recirculate large amount of heat near
the central core regime of the square enclosure. Therefore, the entire
central core is maintained at u 1⁄4 0:4 (cid:1) 0:5 and the strong thermal
gradient is observed along the side walls (Figures not shown). Over-
all, the thermal mixing is largely enhanced near the central core of
the enclosure for Pr 1⁄4 0:7 and 1000 compared to Pr 1⁄4 0:026. ‘Heat-
lines’ clearly demonstrate interesting patterns of convective heat
flow circulation cells at the core for various fluids (different values
of Pr). The formation of various thermal mixing zones would be use-
ful to choose appropriate fluid for specific thermal processing appli-
cations.

investigation of natural convection within
porous square enclosures was performed for various thermal

(uA 1⁄4 0:1 (cid:1) 0:9) at Ra 1⁄4 105 [67]. The Galerkin finite element
method was used in order
the heatfunction
equation (Eq. (59)) using the appropriate heatfunction boundary
conditions (see type 2a of Table 1). Common to all thermal aspect
ratios (uA) at Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)5; Pr 1⁄4 0:015 and Ra 1⁄4 105; the heatlines
illustrate that, the left wall receives heat from the left half of the
bottom wall whereas, the right wall receives heat from the right
half of the bottom wall (similar to Fig. 11(i)(a) and (ii)(a)). Sparsely
distributed heatlines are observed with the low magnitude along
the top region of the side walls for all uA. At Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3; common to
all uA, a pair of heatline cells are observed within the enclosure
associated with the end-to-end heatlines signifying the enhanced
convection (Figures not shown). It is interesting to observe that the
eye of the heatline vortex shifts upward as uA increases. At Da 1⁄4
10(cid:1)1; a pair of primary heatline cells occur near the upper half of
the enclosure whereas a pair of tiny heatline cells occur near the
central core in the lower half of the enclosure, irrespective of uA
(Figures not shown). It may also be noted that, the intensity of the
heatline cells is found to increase with uA. As Pr increases to 1000,
the intensity of convection is largely enhanced, irrespective of uA.
It is interesting to observe that the heatline cells span a greater
area near the central core for the case with uA 1⁄4 0:9 compared to uA
1⁄4 0:1 and 0.5 (Figures not shown). Overall, ‘heatlines’ are useful to
provide control parameters for the evolution of single and multiple
heat circulation zones within the square cavity for various uA.

PBasak and Chamkha [80] carried out natural convection studies
involving nanofluid in the presence of the hot bottom wall, cold side
walls and adiabatic top wall (Fig. 2(II)(a)). As mentioned earlier, the
heatfunction equation (see Eq. (59)) along with the prescribed
boundary conditions (see type 2a of Table 1 and Eqs. (71a) and
(71b)) were solved using the Galerkin finite element method. Iso-
therms and heatlines are analyzed for a wide range of Ra
(103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 105) and nanoparticle volume fraction (0.1 (cid:3) f (cid:3) 0.2).
The results are first discussed for Ra 1⁄4 103 involving various ’ and
those are compared with the base fluid (water). As mentioned ear-
lier, the lower value of Ra corresponds to conduction dominant heat
transfer. Hence, the end-to-end heatlines are found to emanate from
the bottom wall and they are symmetrically distributed along the
left and right walls for both nanofluids and base fluid based on the
symmetric boundary conditions (Figures not shown). The heatlines
clearly depict that the lower half of the side walls receive compara-
tively greater amount of heat from the bottom wall whereas, the
heat flow to the upper half of the cold side walls is lower based on
the weak heatfunction gradient irrespective of f (Figures not
shown). Hence, the thermal boundary layer is found to grow at the
edge of the bottom corners and the larger thickness of boundary

Player is found to be seen at the top portion of side wall (Figures not
shown). The thermal boundary layer thickness at the top portion of
side walls is larger for nanofluids and that increases with f. At Ra 1⁄4
105; the intensity of convection is largely enhanced based on the
intense heatline cells for all f. It may be noted that, a pair of sym-
metric heatline cells are observed within the square enclosure at the
high Ra for both nanofluids and base fluid (Figures not shown). It is
interesting to observe that the convective heat transport for water
(base fluid) is more intense compared to nanofluids at the center of
each heatline circulation zone at the high Ra irrespective of all f
(Figures not shown). In addition, it is also found that the size of the
heatline cell is bigger for water than that for nanofluid, irrespective
of f. Note that, the size of the heatline cell for nanofluid is gradually
reduced with f and hence, larger cold zones are observed through-
out the cavity for nanofluid, irrespective of f (Figures not shown).
The heatlines clearly depict that the conductive heatlines are dense
near the top portion of the vertical walls and they lead to larger local
heat transfer rate for the higher f’s (Figures not shown). The heat-
lines illustrate that the wall heat transport rates are increased by
similar order due to the addition of nanofluid. Overall, the heatline
trajectories within nanofluid filled cavities clearly demonstrate that
the overall thermal mixing in the square enclosure is reduced while
conduction heat transfer rate at the side wall is enhanced with the
addition of nanofluid.

PBasak and Roy [35] carried out numerical studies within a square
enclosure subjected to the isothermal hot bottom and left walls
along with isothermally cold right wall and adiabatic top wall (Fig. 2
(II)(b)). As mentioned earlier, the Galerkin finite element method
was used to solve the heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59))
with the various heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 2a of
Table 1). The numerical studies were carried out for fluids with Pr 1⁄4
0:026 and 1000 over wide range of Ra (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 105). At Ra 1⁄4 103
and Pr 1⁄4 0:026; the end-to-end heatlines emanate from the bottom
and left walls and end on the right wall, depicting the path of the
heat flow (see Fig. 11(i)(b)). As the temperature gradient is maxi-
mum near the lower right corner of the enclosure, the thermal
boundary layer is found to develop towards the upper half of the
right wall (see Fig. 11(i)(b)). As Ra increases to 105, large heatline cir-
culation cells span almost 90% of the enclosure and the intensity of
the circulation cell is found to be significantly higher at Ra 1⁄4 105
(see Fig. 11(ii)(b)). Consequently, the thermal mixing is largely
enhanced near the central core of the square enclosure and a large
zone of the uniform temperature is observed near the central core.
Note that, secondary heatline cells are found to occur near the upper
left corner region of the enclosure (see Fig. 11(ii)(b)). The heatlines
demonstrate that the hot bottom wall distributes large amount of
heat to the cold wall whereas the hot left wall distributes heat to the
top portion of the cold wall (see Fig. 11(ii)(b)). Due to the enhanced
heating of walls, the central core of the square enclosure is main-
tained at the large temperature and the isotherms are found to be
strongly compressed along the middle portion of the right wall and
right half of the bottom wall at the higher Ra (see Fig. 11(ii)(b)). At
the higher Pr (Pr 1⁄4 1000), a large primary heatline circulation cell is
found to occur, and the secondary circulation cells are completely
absent. Due to the enhanced momentum diffusivity, the intensity of
circulation is larger and large amount of heat is transferred to the
top portion of the cold wall. Therefore, the isotherms are largely
compressed at the top regime of the cold wall for Pr 1⁄4 1000 com-
pared to Pr 1⁄4 0:026. The heatlines explicitly illustrate the role of hot
wall(s) for various conduction and convection heat transfer zones. In
addition, the zone of convective heat circulation can be enhanced
via suitably altering hot zones along the walls using the heatline
concept.

heating of the bottom wall (case 2) (see Fig. 2(II)(c)). The heatfunc-
tion governing equation (Eq. (59)) with various heatfunction bound-
ary conditions (see type 2a of Table 1) was solved using the Galerkin
finite element method [68,69]. The results are elaborated for the
fluid media [68] in order to maintain the brevity of the review. The
heatlines and isotherms are shown for the various regimes of Prandtl

and Rayleigh numbers involving various inclination angles ð’ 1⁄4 30

) at Ra 1⁄4 103 and 105 for Pr 1⁄4 0:015
representative case (’ 1⁄4 45
(see Fig. 11(i)(c) and (ii)(c)). The heatlines and isotherms are mostly
smooth curves for all the inclination angles during the conduction
dominant heat transport at Ra 1⁄4 103 (see Fig. 11(i)(c)). Note that,
the larger amount of heat is transferred from the bottom wall to the
left wall especially for the lower ’ and hence, the temperature gradi-
ent is found to be slightly stronger along the left wall compared to
the right wall (see Fig. 11(i)(c)). At the higher Ra (Ra 1⁄4 105), the mul-
tiple heat circulation cells are observed for Pr 1⁄4 0:015 involving all
the inclination angles (see Fig. 11(ii)(c)). On the other hand, the mul-
tiple circulation cells are suppressed and two asymmetric flow circu-
lation cells are found to occupy the entire cavity for the higher Pr
fluids (7.2 and 1000) at the higher inclination angles and Ra 1⁄4 105
(Figures not shown). Interesting features on the heatlines further
demonstrate that the major heat transport to the left wall occurs
directly from the bottom wall whereas the right wall receives heat
based on the convective cell at the smaller inclination angles. On the
other hand, the heat flow is almost evenly distributed to the side
walls at the larger ’’s and larger Pr. Thus, the heatlines are effective
in explaining the heat flow characteristics which vary with ’. The
inclination angles and Prandtl number exhibit important role for
convective heat flow and selective heating of either left or right wall,
as efficiently demonstrated via the heatline trajectories.

PBasak and co-workers [70(cid:1)72] analyzed the heat flow visualiza-
tion during natural convection within tilted square cavities with the
isothermally cold side walls, uniform or non-uniformly heated bot-
tom wall and insulated top wall (Fig. 2(II)(d)) involving fluid [70,71]
and porous [72] media. The Galerkin finite element method was
used in order to solve the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) involving
the appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 2a of
Table 1). The results for fluid media [71] are discussed in order to
maintain the brevity of the review. Numerical results are illustrated
for Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (Fig. 11(i)(d), (ii)(d)). At Ra 1⁄4 103; the strong anti-
clockwise fluid circulation cells with weak clockwise fluid circula-
whereas the clockwise fluid
tion cells are found to occur for ’ 1⁄4 15
circulation cells are absent and anticlockwise fluid circulation cells
span almost the entire cavity for the higher ’’s (’ 1⁄4 45
and 75°).
The heatline characteristics are qualitatively similar for all ’’s at spe-
cific values of Ra. Hence, the heatline characteristics are presented
(see Fig. 11(i)(d)). At Ra 1⁄4 103; the heatline trajec-
only for ’ 1⁄4 45
tories demonstrate the presence of the end-to-end heatlines which
originate from the bottom wall and end on the side walls (see Fig. 11
(i)(d)). Due to the weak heat flow at Ra 1⁄4 103; the isotherms exhibit
weak temperature gradient along the side walls and that can also be
explained based on the sparse heatlines (see Fig. 11(i)(d)). On the
other hand, the dense vertical heatlines signify the stratified temper-
ature zones near the bottom wall of the square enclosure (see Fig. 11
(i)(d)). At Ra 1⁄4 105; the intense closed loop heatline cells near the
central portion of the cavity lead to the enhanced thermal mixing
and thus, the central portion of the cavity is maintained at an uni-
form temperature (see Fig. 11(ii)(d)). However, it is interesting to
observe that the intensity of the heatfunction decreases with ’ (Fig-
ures not shown). Due to the high thermal mixing, the strong temper-
ature gradient is found to occur near the bottom and right walls of
the inclined square enclosure (see Fig. 11(ii)(d)). The heatlines illus-
trate the larger intensity of the convective heat circulation at Ra 1⁄4
105 for Pr 1⁄4 1000 (Figures not shown). It is interesting to observe

r 1⁄4 1000 (Figures not shown). Therefore, a large portion of the right
half of the cavity is maintained at the uniform temperature com-
pared to left half of the cavity for ’ (cid:3) 45°. On the other hand, a single

anticlockwise heatline cell is observed within the cavity for ’ 1⁄4 75
(Figures not shown). Hence, a large region near the central core is
maintained at the uniform temperature for ’ 1⁄4 75
(Figures not

from the bottom wall to the side walls for Pr 1⁄4 1000 at Ra 1⁄4 105
irrespective of ’s (Figures not shown). The isotherms display strong
compression especially along the top portion of side walls for ’ 1⁄4
15
and 75°. It may be noted that, the quali-
tative features of the heatlines are similar for the cases involving the
uniform and non-uniform heating of the bottom wall irrespective of
Pr and Ra. However, the intensity of the heat transfer rate and con-
vective heat circulation is decreased based on the lesser heating
effects for the non-uniform heating of the bottom wall compared to
the uniform heating. Overall, the heatlines are useful to investigate
the role of the tilt angle and various thermal boundary conditions at
the walls on the heat flow visualization for an efficient thermal man-
agement.

PBasak et al. [73,74] carried out the heatline analysis within trape-
zoidal enclosures with the uniformly and non-uniformly heated bot-
tom wall,
insulated top wall and cold side walls (Fig. 2(II)(e))
involving the fluid and porous media. The heatfunction governing
equation (Eq. (59)) with various heatfunction boundary conditions
(see type 2a of Table 1) was solved using the Galerkin finite element
method. The results for the parametric studies involving the fluid
media [73] for the wide range of Rayleigh numbers (Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105)
and Prandtl numbers (Pr 1⁄4 0:026 (cid:1) 1000) with various inclination
angles of the left wall with Y-axis (’ 1⁄4 45
) are presented. Note
that, the heatlines are dense near the central vertical region of the
enclosure whereas they are sparse along the side walls especially for
’ 1⁄4 45
(Figure not shown). As a
result, the temperature gradient near the side walls is comparatively
weaker for ’ 1⁄4 45
(Figure not
shown). The lower central zone is maintained at the large tempera-
ture gradient whereas the major portions of the side walls or top
portion are maintained at the low temperature gradient as exhibited
by the heatline trajectories. The shapes of the heatlines near the core
are identical to the streamlines, indicating the convection dominant
heat transfer at Ra 1⁄4 105 for all Pr. Due to the enhanced convection
at the high Ra, the large heat flow circulation cells at each half
occupy more than 35% of the cavity leading to the enhancement of
the thermal mixing for ’ 1⁄4 45
(see Fig. 11(ii)(e)) and 30° (Figure
not shown). Due to the larger thermal mixing near the central core,
the isotherms are strongly compressed towards the central portion
of the side walls (see Fig. 11(ii)(e)). At Pr 1⁄4 0:7 and 1000, the multi-
ple fluid and heatline cells disappear and the strength of the convec-
tive fluid and heat circulation cells is largely increased, irrespective
of ’. Consequently, the thermal mixing near the central core of the
enclosures is largely enhanced and that leads to large uniform tem-
perature zone near the core. In addition, the isotherms at the high Pr
are strongly compressed along the upper half of the cold side walls
compared to the lower Pr case, irrespective of ’. Overall, the heat-
lines clearly outline the variation in the heat flow patterns with ’
[73]. Hossain and Alim [75] numerically investigated the two-
dimensional laminar steady-state on MHD natural convection within
trapezoidal cavity of various inclination angles with the non-uni-
formly heated bottom wall, cold side walls and adiabatic top wall
(Fig. 2(II)(e)). The heatline and isotherm characteristics within the
trapezoidal enclosures [75] are found to be qualitatively similar to
the earlier works by Basak et al. [73,74].

tigated numerically by Basak et al. [76] and Ramakrishna et al. [77]
for the fluid and porous media, respectively. Eq. (59) was solved
using the Galerkin finite element method with the appropriate heat-
function boundary conditions (see type 2b of Table 1). The fluid

(Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105) and Pr (Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 1000) with different inclina-
tion angles of the right wall with the X-axis (’ 1⁄4 45
). Similar
to the previous works [73,74], the conduction dominant heat trans-
fer is found to occur at Pr 1⁄4 0:015 and Ra 1⁄4 103 based on the
smooth end-to-end heatlines. The localized convection is observed
at Ra 1⁄4 105 with the low Pr based on the multiple circulations of the
heatlines. The heat flow from the bottom wall to the cold side walls
is symmetric for case 1 (Figures not shown). Note that, isotherms are
strongly compressed near the side walls especially for ’ 1⁄4 45
and
60° and that can also be explained based on the strong heatfunction
gradients at Ra 1⁄4 105 (Figures not shown). The dense heatlines sig-

nify the larger thermal mixing near the core especially for ’ 1⁄4 45
and 60° (Figures not shown). It may be noted that, the intensity of
B
the heatline cells is lower for the square cavity (’ 1⁄4 90
) compared
B
to other cavities (’ 1⁄4 45
and 60°) irrespective of Pr and Ra. On the
other hand, the case of the linearly heated left wall and cold right
wall (case 2) shows that the heatlines are asymmetrically distributed
throughout the enclosure compared to case 1 (Figures not shown).
The dense heatlines depict that the heat transfer rate along the right
wall is larger compared to that at the left wall for all ’’s irrespective
of Pr. It is also observed that, the isotherms are highly compressed
along the bottom and right walls due to the intense heatline circula-
tions near the right wall. Overall, the heatlines demonstrate that the
heat distribution along the side walls can be enhanced based on vari-
ous heating situations of the side walls.

PType 2c
PVarol et al. [78] studied natural convection via the heatline
method in a porous right angled triangular enclosure. Two different
thermal boundary conditions (Fig. 2(II)(g)) are applied for the verti-
cal and inclined walls (case 1: non-uniform heating of the bottom
wall with the cold inclined wall and adiabatic vertical wall, case 2:
non-uniform heating of the bottom wall with the cold vertical wall
and insulated inclined wall). The finite difference method was
employed to solve the heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59))
subjected to the appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions (see
type 2c of Table 1). Numerical studies were illustrated for various
values of Darcy(cid:1)Rayleigh number (RaD 1⁄4 Ra ¢ Da 1⁄4 100 (cid:1) 1000) and
aspect ratio (0.25 (cid:3) A (cid:3) 1). The heatline distributions are first dis-
cussed for A 1⁄4 1 involving various values of RaD. At the low RaD
(RaD 1⁄4 100), a pair of asymmetric heatline cells occur for both cases
1 and 2 involving A 1⁄4 1. As RaD increases (RaD (cid:2) 250), the heatline
cell in the right half of the enclosure intensifies for case 1 and hence,
the isotherms are found to be largely compressed along the inclined
wall or the center of the bottom wall within the triangular enclosure
involving A 1⁄4 1 (Figures not shown). On the other hand, the heatline
cell in the left half expands and spans almost 70% of the cavity for
case 2 involving A 1⁄4 1 at the higher RaD (Figures not shown). The
decrease in A (A 1⁄4 aspect ratio) has the significant effect on the heat
flow pattern within the triangular enclosure (Figures not shown).
The numerical results in terms of the heatlines and isotherms are
discussed next for various A at RaD 1⁄4 1000 [78]. The heatline fea-
tures for case 1 depict that the strength of the heatline cell in the left
half is gradually enhanced whereas the intensity of the primary

Pheatline cell in the right half is reduced as A decreases from 1 to 0.5
(Figures not shown). Interestingly, at A 1⁄4 0:25; four tiny multiple
heatline cells occur for case 1 involving RaD 1⁄4 1000. The heatline
trajectories for case 2 demonstrate that the primary heatline cell in
the left half spans the larger region in the cavity for all A
(A 1⁄4 0:25 (cid:1) 1) involving RaD 1⁄4 1000 (Figures not shown). Conse-
quently, the secondary heatline cell is diminished in size and that is
gradually shifted to the extreme right corner region of the cavity for
the lower A involving RaD 1⁄4 1000. The isotherm characteristics
depict that the strong temperature gradient is formed along (i) the
central zone of the bottom wall and/or the middle portion of the
inclined wall (case 1) or (ii) the central zone of the bottom wall and
the middle portion of the left wall (case 2). The role of the adiabatic
or insulated situation either at the vertical and inclined wall along-
with various aspect ratios suitably demonstrates the patterns of the
convective heatline cells leading to various degrees of thermal gra-
dients and single/multiple thermal mixing zones.

PType 2d
PNatural convection in the isosceles triangular enclosures with
various configurations [case 1: inverted (Fig. 2(II)(h)), case 2: straight
(Fig. 2(II)(i)) and case 3: tilted (Fig. 2(II)(j)) was studied via the heat-
line analysis for the linear heating of inclined walls and adiabatic
vertical or horizontal wall (see Figs. 2(II)(h(cid:1)j)) involving various flu-
ids (Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 1000) at Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105 for inclination angles (’)
corresponding to 45° and 60° [79]. Eq. (59) was solved using the
Galerkin finite element method with the appropriate heatfunction
boundary conditions (see type 2d of Table 1). The heat flow distribu-
tions indicate the conduction dominant heat transfer at the low Ra
(Ra 1⁄4 103) for case 1 and case 2 (Figures not shown). On the other
hand, the convective heat flow is observed for case 3 and that is fur-
ther depicted by the presence of the convective heat circulation cells
(Figures not shown). As expected, heat transfer occurs from the
lower half to the upper half of the side walls due to the linear heating
boundary condition in all the cases. The isotherms are sparsely dis-
tributed along the corner regions of the triangular enclosures at the
low Ra in all the cases (Figures not shown). As Ra increases to 105,
the enhanced thermal mixing is observed at the core of the cavity
based on the significant enhancement in the intensity of the heatline
cells. Although the distributions of the fluid flow and heat flow are
and 60°, the intensity of the fluid
qualitatively similar for ’ 1⁄4 45
flow and heat flow decreases as ’ increases (Figures not shown). The
strength of the fluid flow and heatline circulation cells is found to be
higher in case 3 for the identical parameters at Ra 1⁄4 105 involving
Pr 1⁄4 0:015. Note that,
the isotherms are slightly compressed
towards the corner regions of the adiabatic wall for both cases 1 and
2 (Figures not shown). In contrast to cases 1 and 2, the isotherms are
found to be more compressed at the corner region of the adiabatic
walls for case 3. In all the cases, the higher temperature uniformity
is observed at the central zone for Ra 1⁄4 105 due to the greater ther-
mal mixing compared to Ra 1⁄4 103 (Figures not shown). Based on the
heat flow distribution, the symmetric heat flow circulations occur
for cases 1 and 2 whereas single heat flow circulation signifies the
enhanced thermal mixing for case 3 (Figures not shown). As Pr
increases to 1000, the multiple heat circulation cells disappear and
the two oppositely rotating heat circulation cells span the entire cav-
ity in case 1 and case 2 whereas the single heat circulation cell grows
bigger for case 3 (Figures not shown). The heatlines demonstrate
that tilt angles of various triangular cavities with the linear heating
of the inclined wall and adiabatic long wall can effectively control
the convective transport and wall heat transfer rates.

Phot bottom wall with the isothermally cold left, right (wavy surface
with varying amplitudes and number of undulations) and top walls
(Fig. 2(III)(a)). The dimensional form of the heatfunction governing
equation (Eq. (59)) was discretized using the staggered, non-uniform
control volumes and the heatfunction equation was solved numeri-
cally by the finite volume method using the appropriate dimensional
form of the heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 3a of
Table 1). The effect of various parameters such as the undulation
amplitude (λ 1⁄4 0:02 (cid:1) 0:1), number of undulations of the right wall
(1 (cid:3) N (cid:3) 3) and Rayleigh number (Ra 1⁄4 100 (cid:1) 106) on the heatline
and temperature distributions within the complicated cavity were
studied. Due to the waviness of the right wall, the asymmetric heat-
line circulation cells are observed for all λ and N at Ra 1⁄4 105. At the
higher λ (λ 1⁄4 0:1), the size of the heat circulation cell occurring at
the left half is reduced whereas, the size of the heatline cell at the
right half of the enclosure increases (Figures not shown). As the rela-
tive size of the cells changes with λ, the isotherms are observed to
have a skewness towards the left vertical wall at the higher λ (Fig-
ures not shown). It is also interesting to observe that the intensity of
the heat circulation cells decreases with N (N 1⁄4 number of undula-
tions) and the effect is more prominent at the higher λ. Note that,
the isotherms depict wavy fold features near the right half especially
for the higher values of N (N 1⁄4 2 (cid:1) 3). At Ra 1⁄4 105 and 106, the
intense asymmetric heatline cells are observed within the cavity and
the intensity of the right heat circulation cell is significantly higher
compared to the left heat circulation cell, irrespective of N (Figures
not shown). Overall, the heatlines clearly demonstrate the role of
wavy vertical walls with various degree of undulations on convec-
tive heat circulation cells within enclosures leading to the compres-
sion of isotherms (large thermal gradients) at the walls.

PType 3b
PVarol et al. [78] also presented the heatlines in a porous right
angled triangular enclosure with cold side walls and non-uniformly
heated bottom wall (Fig. 2(III)(b)). The finite difference method was
used to solve the heatfunction governing equations (Eq. (59)) using
the appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions (see type 3b of
Table 1). Numerical results are discussed for the various values of
Darcy(cid:1)Rayleigh number (RaD 1⁄4 Ra ¢ Da 1⁄4 100 (cid:1) 1000) and aspect
ratio (0.25 (cid:3) A (cid:3) 1). Results are first discussed for A 1⁄4 1. It is inter-
esting to observe that a pair of asymmetric heatline cells occur near
the lower half of the right angled triangular enclosure for A 1⁄4 1; irre-
spective of RaD (Figures not shown). It is also observed that, the size
and intensity of the heat circulation cells are greater in the left half
in contrast to the right half for all RaD involving A 1⁄4 1 (similar fea-
tures are discussed for type 2c [78]). As RaD increases to 500, the pri-
mary heat circulation cell near the bottom left half spreads largely
towards the top half and compresses the secondary heat circulation
cell to the bottom right corners of the enclosure due to the intense
convection for A 1⁄4 1 (Figures not shown). In addition, the weak sec-
ondary heatline cell occurs near the vicinity of the upper portion of
the inclined wall. The isotherms represent the plume type distribu-
tions within the cavity for all RaD involving A 1⁄4 1 (Figures not
shown). Due to the presence of the inclined wall, the isotherms are
observed to have skewness towards the left vertical wall of the
enclosure, especially at the high RaD involving A 1⁄4 1. The character-
istics of the heatlines and isotherms are observed to be similar with
those for type 2c boundary conditions involving various values of A
at RaD 1⁄4 1000 (Figures not shown). As A decreases from 1 to 0.5, the
intensity of primary heatline cell near the left half of the cavity
increases whereas, the strength of the heatline cell in the right half
of the cavity drastically reduces at RaD 1⁄4 1000 (Figures not shown).
It is also found that the weak secondary heatline cell in the top half
disappears for A 1⁄4 0:75 and 0.5 at RaD 1⁄4 1000. The further decrease
in the aspect ratio (A 1⁄4 0:25) leads to the formation of B(cid:1)enard cells
and the isotherms depict the wavy distribution (Figures not shown).
The role of various walls with various thermal boundary conditions

Pis important to trigger convection heatline circulation cells as eluci-
dated for type 2c. However, the heatline trajectories for type 3b
boundary conditions are the key for the thermal management to
promote multiple B(cid:1)enard type heat circulation cells for the low
aspect ratios (A) at the high RaD involving specific thermal process-
ing applications,
PType 3c
PBasak et al. [84,85] analyzed the heat flow pattern within fluid
[84] and porous [85] inverted triangular cavities with the hot/cold
inclined walls and cold/hot horizontal wall (Fig. 2(III)(c)) using the
heatline concept. The heatline characteristics are found to be almost
similar to the earlier results obtained in the inverted triangular cav-
ity with type 2d boundary conditions for the studies by Basak
et al. [79]. Hence, in order to maintain the brevity of the review, the
numerical results for the present work [84,85] are not discussed in
details. It is worthwhile to compare the heat flow characteristics
within the regular and inverted isosceles triangular cavities as
shown in Fig. 2(III)(d). Such triangular configurations can be used for
heat exchangers or heat recovery systems. The heatlines are found
to be the effective tool for the detailed comparison of heat flow visu-
alization for two entrapped cavities [86,87]. The inclined walls of the
enclosures are isothermally hot whereas the horizontal walls are
maintained isothermally cold [86]. On the other hand, the horizontal
walls are isothermally heated whereas the inclined walls are kept at
isothermally cold for another study [87]. In both the studies, the
Galerkin finite element method was used to solve the heatfunction
governing equation (Eq. (59)) with the appropriate heatfunction
boundary conditions (see type 3c of Table 1) [86,87]. The test
case involving the hot horizontal walls and cold inclined walls [87]
(Fig. 2(III)(d)) is considered and results are discussed for a wide
range of fluids ðPr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 1000Þ with various values of Ra
(Ra 1⁄4 102 (cid:1) 105) in order to analyze the heat transfer process. The
numerical results are first discussed for Pr 1⁄4 0:015. At Ra 1⁄4 102;
heat is transferred mostly by conduction to the inclined walls from
the horizontal walls as depicted by the end-to-end heatlines con-
necting the hot and cold walls (see Fig. 12(i)(a)). Note that, isotherms
are found to be smooth parabolic curves in both the triangles (see
Fig. 12(i)(a)). At the high Ra (Ra 1⁄4 105), the heatlines are found to be
intense in both the triangles (upper and lower) and that further
depicts the strong dominance of convection heat transfer process
(see Fig. 12(ii)(a)). Due to the presence of the multiple heatline cells
with larger intensities, the isotherms are largely distorted within the
lower triangle compared to the upper triangle (see Fig. 12(ii)(a)).
Similar to the previous cases with other geometries at Pr 1⁄4 1000;
the multiple circulations disappear completely and the heatlines are
found to be dense near the bottom portion of the inclined walls
within the lower triangular cavity depicting the larger heat transfer
rate along that zone (Figures not shown). It is observed that, the heat
transfer near the central region of the lower triangular cavity is dom-
inated by convection as seen from the heatlines. The enhanced ther-
mal mixing occurs near the core of the lower triangle at the higher
Pr and Ra. On the other hand, in the upper triangle, there is almost
no effect of the change of Prandtl number on the pattern of the heat-
line trajectories at the vertex and core. The heatline trajectories elu-
cidate an optimal thermal management policy as the higher Pr fluid
may be used in the lower triangular cavity and any fluid irrespective
of the value of Pr can be considered for the upper triangular cavity,
involving isothermally hot horizontal and cold inclined walls.

PBasak and co-workers [88,89] also studied the heat recovery and
heat transfer rates in entrapped porous triangular cavities. Two dif-
ferent thermal boundary conditions are considered within the
entrapped triangular cavities. Basak et al. [88] considered the hot
inclined walls with cold horizontal walls (Fig. 2(III)(d)). Basak
et al. [89] also carried out numerical studies in entrapped porous tri-
angular cavities with hot horizontal walls and cold inclined walls
(Fig. 2(III)(d)). As mentioned earlier, the heatfunction governing

and (ii) convection dominant regime at (a) Ra 1⁄4 105 [87] and (b) Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3 with Ra 1⁄4 5 (cid:5) 105 [89] involving Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (Reprinted with permission from Elsevier).

Pequation (Eq. (59)) with various heatfunction boundary conditions
(see type 3c of Table 1) was solved using the Galerkin finite element
method. In order to maintain the brevity of the review, the test case
with cold inclined walls with hot horizontal walls is discussed [89].
Fig. 12(i)(b) demonstrates that at the low Da, the qualitative features
of the heatlines and isotherms are found to be almost similar to
those at the lower Ra (see Fig. 12(i)(a)). At Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3; multiple heat-
line circulation cells with greater intensity are observed in the lower
triangle resulting in the compressed isotherms along the middle por-
tion of the inclined walls and near the bottom wall of the lower tri-
angle (see Fig. 12(ii)(b)). However, the number of the heatline cells
can be suppressed due to the presence of the porous medium (see
Fig. 12(i)(b) and (ii)(b)). As seen earlier, a pair of weak heatline cells
are observed near the central regime of the upper triangle and that
further results in the stratified layers of isotherms in the upper trian-
gle (see Fig. 12(ii)(b)). The heatline trajectories depict two important
factors: the presence of multiple heatline circulations as a function
of Pr and the suppression of the intensity of the heatline cells due to
the presence of the porous medium and those are important for vari-
ous requirements to entrap or extract heat for heat exchanger and
heat recovery applications.

4.2. Natural convection within enclosed cavities with discrete heaters
along the walls

PZhao et al. [43] performed numerical studies for two-dimensional
laminar natural convection induced by two discrete heating ele-
ments flush mounted on the right wall of a square enclosure (Fig. 3
(I)(a)). Two cases are considered based on thermal boundary condi-
tions of the heaters along the side walls. Case 1 involves the sinusoi-
dal heating due to the heater situated in the upper half (heater-1)
whereas the heater in the lower half (heater-2) of the right wall is
maintained at constant temperature (uniform heating). Case 2
depicts the opposite situation of interchanging the boundary condi-
tions of heater-1 and heater-2 in case 1 (Figures not shown). The
left wall is maintained at the cold temperature and that acts as
the heat sink. It may be noted that the horizontal walls of the enclo-
sure are maintained adiabatic. The heatfunction governing
equation (Eq. (53)) was solved numerically using the heatfunction
boundary conditions as explained in Section 2.5 employing the finite
volume procedure based on SIMPLE algorithm. The numerical results
for case 1 are discussed for frv 1⁄4 0:66 (frv is the non-dimensional
frequency of the wall temperature) whereas the results for case 2

Pare discussed for frv 1⁄4 0:63 involving a range of the dimensionless
time (31 (cid:3) t (cid:3) 35) for Pr 1⁄4 0:7 fluid at Ra 1⁄4 106 (Figures not shown).
At frv 1⁄4 0:66 and t 1⁄4 31; the primary heat circulation cell was
found to span almost 80% of the entire square enclosure for case 1.
In addition, the strong secondary heat circulation cells are found to
occur near heater-1 and near the upper left corner of the enclosure
for case 1 (Figures not shown). As the dimensionless time is
increased (t 1⁄4 35), the secondary heatline cells disappear and a
large heatline circulation cell with a single vortex is found to span
the entire square enclosure. The intense heatline cells exhibit larger
heat distribution from heater-1 to the adjacent cold wall and hence,
the strong thermal gradient is found to occur along heater-1 com-
pared to heater-2 (Figures not shown). Case 2 exhibits a bi-cellular
heatline circulation cells in the upper and central halves of the
square enclosure for t 1⁄4 35. In addition, a large secondary heat cir-
culation cell also occurs at the lower right half of the square enclo-
sure and that further results in the high temperature gradient near
heater-2 (Figures not shown). Overall, the heatline features clearly
illustrate the variation in heat flow with time (t). Also, the heatline
patterns are effective in explaining the occurrence of various ther-
mal mixing zones in the cavities for the different t and frv (Figures
not shown). The heatlines are demonstrated to be efficient to visual-
ize the heat flow within the enclosures involving the localized heat
sources.

PDouble diffusive natural convection within a vertical porous
square enclosure with the localized heating and salting from one
side was numerically studied by Liu et al. [90]. The horizontal walls
and sections on the right wall except the heater, are maintained adi-
abatic whereas the left wall is maintained isothermally cold (Fig. 3(I)
(b)). A finite element based finite volume method was developed to
solve the heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59)) using the heat-
function boundary conditions as explained in Section 2.5. Results
were obtained for the various locations of the heaters along the right
wall (case 1: heater is located at the lower portion, case 2: heater is
located at the central portion, case 3: heater is located at the top por-
tion) over a wide range of buoyancy ratio ((cid:1)55(cid:3)Bu(cid:3)55) at Le 1⁄4 10
and RaD 1⁄4 100 (RaD 1⁄4 Ra ¢ Da). However, the numerical results are
discussed only for Bu 1⁄4 (cid:1)20 and 20 [90]. Note that, the negative
values of Bu correspond to the opposing flow (buoyancy driven flow
is in the opposite direction of the shear driven flow) whereas, the
positive values of Bu depict the aiding flows (buoyancy driven flow
is in same direction of the shear driven flow). It is found that the
heatlines are almost parallel to each other near the central core,

Pdepicting the conduction dominant heat transfer for all Bu, irrespec-
tive of the locations of the heater along the right wall (cases 1-3).
Common to all Bu, the end-to- end heatlines emanating from the hot
source are found to be uniformly distributed throughout the left
wall resulting in higher temperature gradient especially for case 2
(Figures not shown). Due to the greater heat flow, the central core of
the enclosure involving case 2 heating strategy is maintained at the
higher uniform temperature, irrespective of Bu (Figures not shown).
For the cases with Bu 1⁄4 20; the heatlines are found to first move
upward and further, they tend to travel in the downward direction
depicting aiding flows whereas, the heatlines are found to first bend
downward and tend to divert in upward direction for the case with B
u 1⁄4 (cid:1)20 depicting opposing flows (Figures not shown). Overall, the
heatlines are effective in illustrating the change in heat flow patterns
for various values of Bu. In addition, the heatline features also depict
that the overall thermal mixing is higher for the case involving the
central positioning of the heaters.

PMobedi et al. [32] carried out the visualization of diffusion and
convection heat transport in a square cavity with natural convection.
The square cavity is discretely heated along the upper half of the left
wall and cooled along the upper portion of the right wall (Fig. 3(I)
(c)). Note that, other sections of the walls are maintained adiabatic.
The heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59)) associated with the
heatfunction boundary conditions as explained in Section 2.5 was
solved point by point. Results were presented in terms of the heat-
lines and isotherms for the various values of Ra (102 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106) and
Pr 1⁄4 0:7. Two types of the heatline trajectories (diffusion heatlines
and convective heatlines) are elucidated for this review (Figures not
shown). At Ra 1⁄4 102; the zone near the top wall consists of parallel
heatlines implying the diffusive transport whereas the rest of the
zones contains heat circulation cells depicting convection domi-
nance (Figures not shown). As Ra increases to 105 and 106, the heat-
line circulation cell is enlarged near the upper right corner region of
the cavity and that further results in the greater heatfunction gradi-
ent near the top wall (Figures not shown).
In addition, as Ra
increases, the strength of the convection heat transfer is gradually
enhanced and that further results in the enhanced thermal mixing
over a larger area in the cavity (Figures not shown). Overall, the
heatline patterns lead to the thermal management in the cavity at
various zones corresponding to either diffusion or convection domi-
nance.

PDeng [91] studied laminar natural convection in a two-dimen-
sional square cavity with two and three discrete heat source-sink
pairs on the vertical side walls (Fig. 3(I)(d(cid:1)i)). The study was carried
out in order to visualize the effect of the location of the heaters on
the heat flow within the square enclosure. Three different cases
were considered based on the discrete heat source-sink pair location
on the vertical walls. Case 1 involves the location of the heat sources
along the left wall and heat sinks along the right wall (Fig. 3(I)(d)
and (g))). Case 2 involves a source-sink pair on each side wall (Fig. 3
(I)(e) and (h)). Finally, case 3 involves all the sources and sinks on
the left wall (Fig. 3(I)(f) and (i)). The rest of the sections on the left
and right walls along with the horizontal walls are maintained adia-
batic (Fig. 3(I)(d(cid:1)i)). The heatfunctions were obtained via post proc-
essing of Eqs. (58a) and (58b). Numerical simulations were carried
out for Ra 1⁄4 106 involving Pr 1⁄4 0:71. Numerical results are first
illustrated for the two hot source-sink pairs at Ra 1⁄4 106. An intense
heat circulation cell is found to occur near the core of the square
enclosure for the case 1 heating strategy (see Fig. 13(a)). In addition,
it is also observed that, the large amount of heat flow occurs from
the bottom heat source at the left wall to the cold sink in the upper
half of the right wall based on the dense heatlines (see Fig. 13(a)).
Consequently, the higher temperature gradient is found to occur
along the lower heat source of the left wall and upper cold sink of
the right wall (see Fig. 13(a)). The case 2 heating strategy displays
the formation of two heat circulation cells in the upper and lower

Phalves of the square enclosure (see Fig. 13(b)). Significant amount of
heat is transported to the upper heat sink on the left wall from two
heaters and that can be explained based on the larger heatfunction
gradient. The heatline trajectories from two opposite heaters end at
the upper heat sink of the left wall. The heatlines from the lower
heater take a longer path accompanied by large convective heatline
cells. On the other hand, comparatively lesser amount of heat is
transferred to the heat sink on the right wall from the heater at the
left wall and the heatline trajectories also surround the convective
heatline cells (see Fig. 13(b)). The dense heatline trajectories ema-
nating from both the heaters lead to a horizontal plume type iso-
therms near the junction of the heater-sink junction at the left wall.
Due to the enhanced heat transport as depicted by the heatline tra-
jectories, the isotherms are largely compressed near the junction of
the heater-sink at the left wall. Four distinct heat circulation cells
are observed within the square enclosure as the heat source-sink are
alternately placed along the left wall for case 3 (see Fig. 13(c)). It is
also observed that, the heater in the lower portion of the left wall
transfers larger amount of heat to the adjacent cold zones and that is
clearly demonstrated based on the dense heatlines (see Fig. 13(c)).
In addition, the plume type isotherms are also observed at the junc-
tion of the bottom heater-sink at the left wall (see Fig. 13(c)). On the
other hand, the sparse heatlines signify comparatively smaller
amount of heat transport from the top or bottom heater to the top or
bottom portion of the cavity (see Fig. 13(c)). The heatlines demon-
strate that the type of heat source-sink arrangement plays a crucial
role to maintain various targeted thermal mixing zones for various
processing applications. Results are next illustrated for three hot
source-sink pairs. The case 1 heating strategy displays a single heat-
line circulation cell with multiple vortices (see Fig. 13(d)). The larger
heatfunction gradient along the top cold sink of the right wall clearly
signifies that the top cold sink receives the large amount of heat
from all the heaters of the left wall. Consequently, the temperature
gradient is found to be higher along the lower hot zone of the left
wall and the upper cold sink along the right wall (see Fig. 13(d)). The
case 2 heating strategy demonstrates the formation of three heat cir-
culation cells within the square enclosure (see Fig. 13(e)). Note that,
the heat distribution to the top cold sink of the right wall
is
enhanced due to the combined heatline trajectories from the top
heater at the left wall and only heater at the right wall. The central
sink at the left wall receives heat from the heater at the bottom por-
tion of the right wall and only heater at the right wall whereas the
bottom sink at the right wall receives heat from bottom heater at
the left wall. Hence, the temperature gradient is found to be larger
along the top cold sink of the right wall and central cold sink of the
left wall (see Fig. 13(e)). The case 3 heating strategy (three hot
source-sink pairs along the left wall) displays the formation of six
heat circulation cells in the square enclosure (see Fig. 13(f)). Similar
to case 2, the top and central cold sinks of the left wall receive major-
ity of the heat from the adjacent heaters and that can be explained
based on the larger temperature gradient (see Fig. 13(f)). The heat-
line trajectories clearly demonstrate that the multiple heat source-
sink with case 3 can be useful to maintain a hotter left and cooler
right zone required for the specific thermal management. The overall
spectrum of the heatlines [91] associated with various heat source-
sink assemblies as seen in Figs 13(a-f) are found to be unique visuali-
zation route for ‘thermal management’ involving thermal processing
with distributed heaters.

PDas and Basak [92,93] analyzed the role of the various positions
of discrete heaters along each side wall within a square enclosure
for fluid [92] and porous [93] media. The heatline trajectories within
fluid medium [92] are discussed for the brevity. The horizontal
walls of the square enclosure are maintained adiabatic. The Galerkin
finite element method was used to solve the heatfunction
equation (Eq. (59)) using the heatfunction boundary conditions as
explained in Section 2.5. In order to maintain the brevity of the

Preview, the numerical results are discussed only for the central (case

(103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 105) for Pr 1⁄4 0:015 and 7.2. Results are first analyzed for

circular arcs connecting the hot and cold sections of the side walls
depicting the dominance of conduction (Figures not shown). How-
ever, as Ra increases to 105, the intense primary and secondary heat-
line cells are observed throughout the cavity and that results in
uniform temperature distribution near the central core of the enclo-
sure irrespective of Pr (figures not shown). Various locations of heat-
ers at the side walls significantly alter the heat flow to the cold
zones and size and/or intensity of convective heat circulation zones.
The heatline trajectories illustrate that both the heaters along the
side walls should not be near to the top wall as the hot fluid would
recirculate heat near the top portion leading to poor heat transfer to
the bottom colder zones [92,93]. Interesting features of heatlines are
also observed for case 2 which involves one heater at the top portion
and other at the bottom portion (Fig. 3(I)(k)]. Although the heatline
features are similar for cases 1 and 2, it is found that the upper cold
right wall and lower cold left wall receive heat from both the heaters
for case 2 and this contrasts the heat flow features of case 1, irre-
spective of Ra and Pr. At Ra 1⁄4 105; due to the asymmetric locations
of the heaters along the side walls (case 2), the asymmetric heatline
cells are observed within the square enclosure and that further
results in the large thermal mixing near the central core for both Pr.

PHence, the heatlines are found to be an effective tool in demon-
strating the various thermal mixing zones within the square enclo-
sure for different discrete heating strategies.
In addition, the
heatlines can be used to decide optimal locations of heaters for the
efficient thermal management involving specific thermal processing
applications.

PKim and Jang [94] numerically and experimentally studied the
heat transfer phenomena in a sensor tube of a mass flow controller
involving the presence of a discrete heater along the bottom wall of
the cavity (Fig. 3(II)(a)). The dimensional form of the heatfunction
governing equation (Eq. (59)) for tube coordinates was solved using
the control volume based finite difference method [94] subjected to
the dimensional heatfunction boundary conditions as explained in
Section 2.5. The results are obtained for the various flow rates
(10 cm3/min (cid:3) _v(cid:3)50 cm3/min) in terms of the heatlines which clearly
describe the net flow of heat in the sensor tube comprising both the
tube wall and the gas stream (Figures not shown). It may be noted
that, the narrower spacing between two adjacent heatlines corre-
sponding to the larger heatfunction gradient depicts higher heat
transfer between the heatlines. The heatlines clearly state that heat
is transferred from the heater along the axial tube wall via conduc-
tion. Further, heat is transferred from the wall to the gas stream at
the upstream section and from the gas stream to the wall at the
downstream section via convection (Figures not shown). At the
upstream section, higher heat is transferred from the tube wall to
the gas stream especially for the higher flow rate ( _v). Thus, the tube

Pwall temperature at the upstream section is decreased with the flow
rate. On the other hand, at the downstream section, the higher heat
transfer rate occurs from the gas stream to the tube wall for the
higher mass flow rate ( _m) (Figures not shown). Therefore, the tube
wall temperature at the downstream section is increased with the
flow rate. Overall, the heat transport in the enclosure (sensor tube of
a mass flow controller) involving a discrete heater along the bottom
wall is clearly illustrated by the heatlines. In addition, the heatlines
provide the essential visualization tool of thermal management/dis-
tribution for the heat transfer process involving bottom heater tube
and gas stream.

PBasak and co-workers [35,95(cid:1)100] analyzed the heatline
approach in order to visualize the heat flow to study laminar natural
convection in fluid
[35,97,99,100] and porous [95,96,98] filled
square cavities with distributed heat sources (Fig. 3(II)(b(cid:1)d)). Vari-
ous cases were considered based on the locations of single
[35,95(cid:1)100] and multiple [96,99,100] heaters along the walls. How-
ever, in order to maintain the brevity of the review, the cases involv-
ing the central location of the heaters along the walls (case 1),
central location of the heater along the bottom wall while asymmet-
ric heater locations along the side walls (case 2) and multiple heaters
along the side walls and bottom wall (case 3) are discussed (Fig. 3(II)
(b(cid:1)d)). The discrete heating within fluid filled square cavity [97,99]
is discussed in details. Numerical studies were carried out for a wide
range of fluids with Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 1000 over a range of Rayleigh
numbers, Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105. The Galerkin finite element method was
used to solve the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) using the heat-
function boundary conditions as derived based on Section 2.5. Com-
mon to all the cases, the heat source at the central regime of the

Pbottom wall transfers heat to the adjacent cold regimes as well as to
the small regions at the lower portion of the side walls irrespective
of Ra (see Fig. 14 (i and ii)(a(cid:1)c)). In case 1, the cold upper portions of
the side walls receive heat from the heat sources at the central por-
tions of the bottom and side walls (see Fig. 14(i and ii)(a)) irrespec-
tive of Ra. In case 2, the upper cold portion of the right wall receives
heat from the heaters of the left, right and bottom walls in contrast
to the other cold sections of the enclosure irrespective of Ra (see
Fig. 14(i and ii)(b)). In case 3, the cold portion along the lower half
receives heat from all the adjacent heaters whereas the upper cold
portion of the side walls receive heat only from the heaters along
the central portion of the side walls (see Fig. 14(i and ii)(c)) irrespec-
tive of Ra. Common to all the cases, at the low Ra, the smooth end-
to-end heatlines are observed (see Fig. 14(i)(a and c)) indicating con-
duction dominance whereas, at the high Ra, the intense heatline cir-
culation cells are observed indicating greater heat circulation near
the central core (see Fig. 14(ii)(a and c)). Consequently, the thermal
mixing is found to be higher in all the cases at Ra 1⁄4 105. However,
the larger temperature uniformity is observed especially for cases 2-
3 (see Fig. 14(ii)(b and c)) compared to case 1 (see Fig. 14(ii)(a)). The
strength of the heatline cells is found to be largely increased for
the higher Pr (Pr 1⁄4 1000) involving cases 1(cid:1)3. Consequently, the
enhanced thermal mixing leads to larger zones of uniform tempera-
ture near the central regime of the square cavity, irrespective of
cases 1(cid:1)3 at the higher Pr. It is clearly shown that, the heatlines are
effective in explaining the heat flow trajectories which are the key
to the thermal management to control the heat flow in a particular
location, enhanced convective heat flow circulations and finally,
thermal mixing.

abatic sections and remaining sections on the side walls are cold (see the second panel plots of Figs. (i)(a(cid:1)c) and (ii)(a(cid:1)c)).

PBanerjee et al. [101] reported the steady state simulation of natu-
ral convection in a horizontal planar square cavity with two discrete
heat sources flush-mounted on its bottom wall (Note that, L1 is the
left heater length, and L2 is the right heater length) (Fig. 3(II)(e)). The
heaters are modeled as constant-flux heat sources (q00
2). The
rest of the portions on the bottom wall and the entire top wall are
adiabatic. The side walls of the cavity are isothermal heat sinks. The
buoyancy-driven convection is simulated for varying length and/or
strength ratios of the two heat sources involving a fixed cavity size
and a constant value of total thermal energy input. The post process-
ing of the heatfunction equations (Eqs. (58a) and (58b)) was carried
out to obtain heatfunctions based on the finite volume based solu-
tions of velocities and temperature. Numerical results were obtained
for a wide range of parameters such as the heater length ratio
(0.4 (cid:3) Lr (cid:3) 1.7), flux strength ratio of heaters (0:4(cid:3)q00
(cid:3)3) at Ra 1⁄4 7:1

and the flux strength ratio of the heaters is defined as q00

The parameter, Ra 1⁄4 7:1 (cid:5) 105 signifies the convection dominant
regime within the enclosures. Simulation studies were also carried
out for the different values of q00
involving Lr 1⁄4 1 (Figures not
r
shown). In the case of q00
r 1⁄4 0:4; the heatline circulation cells above
the right heater are found to spread over the entire cavity (Figures
not shown). On the other hand, the convection roll over the left
heater is squeezed up as a corner vortex for q00
r increases
(0:5(cid:3)q00
(cid:3)2), the recirculation vortex over the left heater grows in
r
intensity and consequently, the size of the right recirculation vortex
over the right heater is gradually reduced. At q00
r 1⁄4 3; the heatline
trajectories indicate that the left vortex practically occupies the
entire cavity and that squeezes the right vortex as a small corner roll
near the right top corner (Figures not shown). Consequently, the
heat flow is found to be increased especially to the bottom half of
the right wall and that is further represented by the compressed iso-
therms along those zones (Figures not shown). As Lr increases from
0.4 to 1.7, the left fluid and heat circulation vortices grow progres-
sively strong and that results in strong thermal gradient along the
upper half of the side walls (Figures not shown). It may be noted
that, the heatlines are symmetric for Lr 1⁄4 1 and q00
r 1⁄4 1 compared to
the other cases. Thus, trajectories of heatlines illustrate that the
length and flux strength of the heaters are the two important param-
eters to control heat flow in various zones in the cavities.

PBanerjee et al. [102] also carried out thermomagnetic convection
within a square cavity along the bottom wall (Fig. 3(II)(e)). It may
also be noted that, the external magnets with identical dipoles are
located at the distance MY (symmetric with respect to the centerline)
such that the external magnet on the left half is located at X 1⁄4 0:25
and Y 1⁄4 (cid:1)MY and the external magnet on the right half is located at
X 1⁄4 0:75 and Y 1⁄4 (cid:1)MY . Each external magnet is placed just below a
heater (with constant heat flux and finite length) which is attached
with the bottom wall. The working fluid was considered to be a
water-based ferrofluid (Pr 1⁄4 49:6). The finite volume method was
used to solve the heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59)) along
with the heatfunction boundary conditions based on Section 2.5. The
heatline trajectories were obtained for a range of values of MY
(0.1 (cid:3) MY (cid:3) 0.25) and the vertical depth of
the enclosure, L
(1⁄4 0:02 m and 0.07 m). It is interesting to observe that the intensity
of the heat circulation is lower for the case with MY 1⁄4 0:25 due to a
weaker magnetic field compared to MY 1⁄4 0:1 (Figures not shown). It
may be noted that, the heatlines are sparsely distributed along the
central core for MY 1⁄4 0:25 and that indicates lower convection rates
(Figures not shown). On the other hand, the heatlines are clustered
especially near the lower central vertical zone of the cavity for MY 1⁄4
0:1 depicting intense convection. It is also observed that, few heat-
lines emanating from the heaters are directly connected to the side
walls for MY 1⁄4 0:25; indicating an overall weaker participation of

Pthe heatline cells in heat transfer compared to MY 1⁄4 0:1 (Figures not
shown). The heatline features for various vertical depths (L) of the
enclosures signify that the heatlines are sparse and the intensity of
the heatline cells is lesser for the smaller cavity (L 1⁄4 0:02 m) com-
pared to the larger one (L 1⁄4 0:07 m) where dense heatlines along
with intense heatline cells are observed indicating greater convec-
tion effects (Figures not shown). Note that, the magnets within L 1⁄4
0:02 m cavity induce stronger magnetic field leading to weaker con-
vection and heatline circulation cells. Overall, the heatline is found
to be beneficial in locating the heat stagnation and convection zones
in the cavity in the presence of multiple localized heat sources and
external magnets.

PDeng et al. [103] presented a systematic numerical study on a
two-dimensional, steady state and laminar natural convection of
fluid (Pr 1⁄4 0:71) in a rectangular enclosure with discrete heat sour-
ces on the top half of the left wall and left half of the bottom wall
(Fig. 3(II)(f)). The right wall is maintained isothermally cold and the
other sections of the walls are kept adiabatic. It may be noted that,
the heaters are maintained at constant hot temperature or constant
heat flux. Studies were carried out for the four different cases of
combined temperature scale (case I: both the heaters are maintained
at isothermal high temperature, case II: left heat source of isother-
mal high temperature and bottom heater with constant heat flux,
case III: left heat source at constant heat flux and bottom heater
with isothermal high temperature, case IV: constant heat flux along
both the heaters). It may be noted that, the case I heating strategy
further involves two different heating cases (case Ia: temperature of
the heater on the bottom wall is higher than that on the left wall,
case Ib: temperature of the heater on the left wall is higher than that
on the bottom wall). The heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) was solved
involving the heatfunction boundary conditions (as explained in
Section 2.5) using the finite volume method. Similar to the previous
study [91], convection is found to be very weak at the low Rayleigh
number (Ra 1⁄4 103) as the end-to-end heatlines are mostly observed
within the cavity for all the cases. As Ra increases (Ra 1⁄4 105), con-
vection is found to be stronger in all the cases and hence, intense
heat circulation cells are formed within the enclosure (see Fig. 15
(a(cid:1)e)). This further results in larger heat transport to the cold right
wall from the hot sources in the left and bottom walls (see Fig. 15
(a(cid:1)e)). The heatline characteristics for case Ia clearly illustrate that
the heat transfer rate is higher from the bottom heat source to the
cold right wall whereas the heat transfer rate is comparatively lower
from the heater on the left wall to the cold right wall (see Fig. 15(a)).
On the other hand, the dense heatlines near the heater of the left
wall depict the larger heat transfer rate to the cold right wall for the
case Ib heating strategy (see Fig. 15(b). Results of cases II(cid:1)IV for Ra 1⁄4
105 are found to be interesting. The overall heat flow within the cav-
ity is dominated by the isothermal heat source, and the effect of the
heat flux source is not as strong as that of the isothermal heat source
(see Fig. 15(c(cid:1)e)). This is further indicated by the heatlines which
clearly display that the heat flow is greater to the right wall from the
heater on the left wall for case II (see Fig. 15(c)) whereas, the heat
flow is greater from the discrete heater on the bottom wall to the
right wall for case III (see Fig. 15(d)). In addition, it is also found that
the intensity of the convective heatline cells is slightly lesser for case
II compared to case III (see Fig. 15(c and d)). In case IV, the two heat
sources of uniform flux surfaces display features which can be
explained in a similar manner of cases Ia and Ib (see Fig. 15(a and b)
and (e)). Based on the effective heat circulation over a larger zone,
the overall thermal performance is found to be improved for cases Ia
and III in contrast to the other cases (case Ib, case II and case IV)
within the square cavity. The heatline trajectories are found to be
useful to control the heating rates at various targeted portions of the
cavity via using the isothermal heater or constant flux heater.

PDas and Basak [92,93] also used the heatline approach in order to
visualize the effect of the symmetric and asymmetric locations of

Pheaters on the heat flow within the triangular enclosures. The heat-

cussed as the representative case in order to maintain the brevity of

as a representative case. The horizontal wall of the triangular enclo-
sure is maintained adiabatic. The Galerkin finite element method
was used to solve the heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59))
using the heatfunction boundary conditions based on Section 2.5.

P(103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 105) and Pr (Pr 1⁄4 0:015 and 7.2). At Ra 1⁄4 103; the heat-
line features are similar to those observed in the previous works
[35,97]. However, at Ra 1⁄4 105 and Pr 1⁄4 0:015; a large primary heat-
line cell is found to span the central core of the triangular-type 1 and
type 2 cavities (Figures not shown). As a result, a large zone near the
central core is maintained at the higher uniform temperature based
on the intense primary heat circulation cells. In addition, the second-
ary heatline cells are observed near the lower half of the side walls
within the triangular-type 1 enclosure and near the upper half of the
side walls within the triangular-type 2 enclosure (Figures not
shown). It may be noted that, the secondary heatline cells result in
local thermal mixing near the corner region of the triangular enclo-
sures (Figures not shown). At Pr 1⁄4 7:2 and Ra 1⁄4 105; the heatline
cells are found to expand horizontally and they spread over a larger
region near the core. Hence, the thermal mixing is found to be
extended over a large zone near the central core compared to Pr 1⁄4
0:015 (Figures not shown). Overall, the heatlines clearly illustrate
that the specific locations of asymmetric heaters promote convective
heat transport over an extensive region especially within the trian-
gular-type 2 (inverted triangular) cavity. In addition, Das and Basak
[92,93] carried out comparative studies on the heatlines for various
configurations of cavities (square, triangular-type 1 and triangular
type 2). A few representative case studies demonstrate that triangu-
lar-type 1 or type 2 cavity can be recommended based on the
enhanced thermal mixing for specific locations of heaters.

PAs mentioned earlier, Soleimani et al. [47] carried out natural
convection studies within air filled (Pr 1⁄4 0:7) square enclosures sub-
jected to the discrete heating from the middle portion of the left and
bottom walls (Fig. 3(III)(a)). It may be noted that, the middle section
of the top and right walls are maintained isothermally cold. The
other portions of the walls are maintained adiabatic. The heatfunc-
tion governing equations (Eqs. (58a) and (58b)) were numerically
solved using the local radial basis function-based differential quad-
rature (LRBF-DQ) method involving various heatfunction boundary
conditions based on Section 2.5. Numerical studies were carried out
over a wide range of Ra (Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105). At Ra 1⁄4 103; the cold zone
along the top wall receives heat from the heaters located along the
left as well as the bottom wall whereas the cold zone along the right
wall receives heat from the heater of the bottom wall only (Figures
not shown). However, the temperature gradient is weaker along the
hot and cold walls at Ra 1⁄4 103. As Ra increases to 105, the large heat-
line cells span almost the entire enclosure and that results in the
larger heat circulation near the central core (Figures not shown). In
addition, the intense heatline cells result in larger heat flow from the
heaters to the cold zones and that further results in larger tempera-
ture gradient along the cold and hot side walls compared to Ra 1⁄4
103 (Figures not shown). It may be noted that, the larger thermal
mixing is found to occur near the central core of the enclosures and
that can also be explained based on the larger temperature unifor-
mity near the central core at Ra 1⁄4 105 (Figures not shown). Except
for the low Ra (Ra 1⁄4 103), the thermal mixing is larger near the core
area for the case involving discrete heating compared to the case
involving differential heating for Ra (cid:2) 104 (Figures not shown). The
heatline trajectories devise the way of thermal management to
choose the discrete heating policy over differential heating. In addi-
tion, various thermal properties designated via Pr and Ra can be the
control parameters to promote the enhanced thermal mixing in vari-
ous zones of the cavities.

4.3. Conjugate natural convection within enclosed cavities

PBasak et al. [104] studied the heatline trajectories during conju-
gate natural convection in a square cavity. The heat flow distribution
within the square cavity enclosed by the vertical conducting walls
(Fig. 4(I)(a(cid:1)c)) of the finite thicknesses, tl (thickness of the left wall)
and tr (thickness of the right wall) was analyzed for various fluids

P(Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 1000) based on the thick walls at the left or/and right
wall(s) [case 1: thick left wall, case 2: thick right wall and case 3:
thick left and right walls] with different thermal conductivity ratios
between solid and fluid regions (Rk 1⁄4 ks=kf 1⁄4 0:1 (cid:1) 10; ks denotes
the thermal conductivity of the solid phase and kf depicts the ther-
mal conductivity of the fluid within the enclosure). The comparison
of cases 1-3 is done with the identical total thickness of the walls
such that tl (case 1) D tr (case 2) D tl þ tr (case 3) D 0.2 (see Fig. 16
(i)(a(cid:1)c) and (ii)(a(cid:1)c)). The Galerkin finite element method was used
to solve the heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59)) using the
appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions (see Section 2.6).
Numerical results are first presented in terms of isotherms and heat-
lines for Rk 1⁄4 0:1. At Ra 1⁄4 103; the end-to-end parallel heatlines
occur for all three cases (see Fig. 16(i)(a(cid:1)c)) whereas additional con-
vective heatline cells occur at the lower portion of the cavity only for
case 1 (see Fig. 16(i)(a)) and case 3 (see Fig. 16(i)(c)). Due to the con-
duction dominant effect, the isotherms are parallel to the side walls
within the solid block for all the cases and that can also be explained
based on the parallel heatlines (see Fig. 16(i)(a(cid:1)c)). On the other
hand, the isotherms are slightly distorted near the core of the cavity
in all the cases due to the comparatively higher convective effect
(see Fig. 16(i)(a(cid:1)c)). At Ra 1⁄4 105; the strength of the heat circulation
cells is largely enhanced in all the cases and the isotherms are found
to be distorted near the core due to the convective heat transport
(see Fig. 16(ii)(a(cid:1)c)). However, the heatline and isotherm features
within the solid wall are found to be similar to Ra 1⁄4 103 (see Fig. 16
(ii)(a(cid:1)c)). Fig. 16(ii)(a(cid:1)c) illustrate the role of the placement of the
thick wall at the high Ra. The thick wall in case 1 and case 3 leads to
larger intense heatline circulation cells with large heating rates at
the center. On the other hand, a thick wall near the hot left wall may
not be recommended as the thick wall at the hot side would entrap
heat and thus the heatline cells would be less intense leading to
lesser heating rate at the core. As Rk increases to 10, the heatline cir-
culation cells intensify and they occupy almost 80% of the cavity,
indicating higher thermal mixing within the cavity in almost all the
cases (Figures not shown). Note that, a crescent shaped heatline vor-
tex is observed for Rk 1⁄4 10 compared to Rk 1⁄4 0:1 in all the cases.
The increase in the wall thickness also has significant impact on the
heatline characteristics within the enclosure. The heatlines demon-
strate that the thermal mixing at the core of the cavity and wall heat
transfer rate can be controlled suitably via various parameters such
as Rk, tl and tr.

PMobedi and Oztop [105] numerically studied conjugate natural
convection within a rectangular enclosure involving a thick solid
ceiling (Fig. 4(I)(d)). The enclosure involves the hot left wall and cold
right wall along with the adiabatic horizontal walls. The finite differ-
ence method was
heatfunction
equation (Eq. (59)) with the appropriate boundary conditions (see
Section 2.6). Numerical results were obtained in terms of the heat-
lines and isotherms for various values of Ra (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106), the
dimensionless ceiling wall thickness (tc 1⁄4 0:05 and 0.5) and thermal
conductivity ratio (Rk 1⁄4 1 and 100) for Pr 1⁄4 0:71. Results are first
discussed for the thick horizontal top wall, tc 1⁄4 0:5; low thermal
conductivity ratio, Rk 1⁄4 1 and two different values of Ra (Ra 1⁄4 103
and 106). At Ra 1⁄4 103;
the parallel end-to-end heatlines are
observed within the solid block whereas, the weak heatline cell is
observed near the lower central half of the fluid filled enclosure (Fig-
ures not shown). At Ra 1⁄4 106; the heatlines are found to be slightly
distorted within the solid block and a large heatline cell spans the
rest of the enclosure. In addition, the dense heatlines are observed
near the top and side walls of the fluid-filled enclosure (Figures not
shown). For the higher Rk (Rk 1⁄4 100), the strong one-dimensional
conduction heat transfer in the solid wall is observed whereas, the
heatline patterns are found to be similar to Rk 1⁄4 1 in the rest of the
cavity (Figures not shown). As the thickness of the solid wall is
reduced (tc 1⁄4 0:05), the heatline circulation cells are found to span

Palmost 80% of the entire enclosure and the heatlines are clustered
near the top half of the enclosure (Figures not shown). Similar to tc 1⁄4
0:5; almost one dimensional heat transfer exists in the ceiling wall of
the enclosure. The effect of the presence of the solid ceilings on the
patterns of the heat flow in the fluid region and solid wall is clearly
illustrated via heatlines.

PHakyemez et al. [106] numerically investigated the effect and
location of the heat barrier along the ceiling wall on the heat flow
within the enclosure. Note that, a heat barrier is located along the
ceiling wall with the finite thickness as shown in Fig. 4(I)(e). The
heat barrier is an insulated partition between the left and right
halves of the ceiling. The vertical walls of the enclosure are differen-
tially heated and the horizontal walls are adiabatic. The heatfunction
equation (Eq. (59)) was solved by employing the alternating-direc-
tion implicit (ADI) method using various heatfunction boundary con-
ditions (see Section 2.6). Results were obtained for a wide range of
Ra (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106) and thermal conductivity ratio (1 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 100) at
Pr 1⁄4 0:71. Results are first discussed for the low Ra (Ra 1⁄4 103) at
various values of Rk. At Rk 1⁄4 1; the presence of the heat barrier in
the ceiling does not considerably affect the heat transfer rate
through the fluid region of the enclosure (see Fig. 16(i)(d)). However,
the heatlines are found to be slightly distorted near the barrier as
they bend near the lower tip of the barrier (see Fig. 16(i)(d)). The
path of the heatlines at Rk 1⁄4 1 illustrates that, heat is transferred
from the hot region of the ceiling to the fluid and subsequently, that
passes to the cold region of the ceiling wall (see Fig. 16(i)(d)). Fig. 16
(i)(d) also illustrates that, direct heat transfer from the hot to the

Pcold wall is not observed near the top portion of the cavity due to
the presence of the heat barrier. On the other hand, heat is trans-
ferred directly from the hot wall to the cold wall at the central and
lower portions of the enclosure (Fig. 16(i)(d)). Note that, the iso-
therms are almost vertical straight lines near the left and right walls
whereas, they are found to be slightly distorted near the central core
of the cavity as depicted in Fig. 16(i)(d). At the higher Rk (Rk 1⁄4 100),
two separate hot and cold regions with almost uniform heat distri-
butions occur at the right and left halves of the heat barrier (Figures
not shown). It is also found that the isotherms in the upper side of
the fluid region are distributed from the edge of the heat barrier (Fig-
ures not shown). Results are next discussed for higher Ra. At Ra 1⁄4
106; the convection effect is largely dominant and significant heat in
the fluid region is transferred via convection (see Fig. 16(ii)(d)).
Hence, isotherms form strong temperature gradient along the left
and right walls based on the dense heatlines (see Fig. 16(ii)(d)). At Rk
1⁄4 1; heat transfer through the ceiling is slightly affected by the heat
barrier as depicted by the heatlines and isotherms involving Ra 1⁄4
106 (see Fig. 16(ii)(d)). At Ra 1⁄4 106 and Rk 1⁄4 1; the sparse heatlines
are observed in the ceiling wall as demonstrated in Fig. 16(ii)(d).
Although the weak distribution of isotherms is observed in the left
half of the solid wall (near the left side of the barrier), the clustered
isotherms occur near the extreme right half of the solid wall (near
the right side of the barrier) (see Fig. 16(ii)(d)). At the higher Rk
(Rk 1⁄4 100) and Ra 1⁄4 106; conduction in the ceiling wall is strong
and the isotherms are clustered at the edge of the heat barrier due to
the formation of hot and cold regions. It is found that heatlines are

Pdense towards the right half of the heat-barrier for the higher Rk
(Rk 1⁄4 100) compared to Rk 1⁄4 1 involving Ra 1⁄4 106. Overall, the
heatlines illustrate a few complex features in heat flow distribution
within the ceiling in the presence of the heat barrier. In addition, the
complicated path of the heatline trajectories across the barrier and
the heatlines at the core fluid are coupled to determine the overall
heating pattern in the cavity with the top ceiling involving industrial
applications.

PVarol et al. [107] performed a numerical study on natural convec-
tion heat transfer of cold water near 4°C in a thick bottom walled
porous cavity. It is assumed that the cavity is isothermally heated
from the bottom wall and cooled from the ceiling with adiabatic ver-
tical walls (Fig. 4(I)(f)). The finite difference method was used to
solve the governing heatfunction equations (Eq. (59)) [107] using
various heatfunction boundary conditions based on the Section 2.6.
The effects of the thermal conductivity ratio (Rk 1⁄4 0:1 (cid:1) 10), Dar-
cy(cid:1)Rayleigh number (Ra 1⁄4 1000 (cid:1) 3000) and bottom wall thickness
(tD 1⁄4 0:1 (cid:1) 0:2) were studied. Results are first illustrated at Rk 1⁄4 tD
1⁄4 0:1 for various Ra. Common to all Ra, the heat circulation cells are
found to occur in the bottom half of the enclosure whereas vertical
parallel heatlines are found to occur in the top half due to the poor
fluid circulation in the upper half (Figures not shown). It may be
noted that, the increase in Ra enhances the strength of convection as
exhibited by the intense heatline circulation cells in the bottom
zone (Figures not shown). Consequently, the isotherms are found to
be more distorted in the bottom half. However, in the bottom solid
wall, the heatlines are found to be parallel to each other and also
parallel to the vertical walls signifying one-dimensional conduction
heat transfer irrespective of Ra (Figures not shown). The increase in
the wall thickness (tD) from 0.1 to 0.2 reduces the strength of the
heatline circulation cells and that increases the effect of conduction
heat transfer (Figures not shown). It is also observed that, the
increase in the thermal conductivity ratio (Rk 1⁄4 10) increases the
number of heatline circulation cells due to the high conductivity of
the solid wall (Figures not shown). In addition, the strength of the
heatline circulation cells is found to be largely enhanced and that
further signifies strong convection across a large region in the cen-
tral half of the enclosure for the higher values of Rk (Rk 1⁄4 10). Over-
all,
transfer is
conduction dominant within the solid walls irrespective of Rk, tD and
Ra. Finally, various heatline trajectories and evolution of multiple
heatline circulation cells are predicted in porous enclosures with the
thick bottom wall involving large thermal conductivity ratio (Rk)
with tD 1⁄4 0:2.

PAlsabery et al. [108] carried out studies on the heatline visualiza-
tion during conjugate natural convection in a square cavity filled
with nanofluid and subjected to sinusoidal temperature variations
on both the horizontal walls (Fig. 4(I)(g)). The vertical walls of the
square cavity are maintained adiabatic. Various thicknesses of the
solid wall are considered at the bottom wall. The heatfunction gov-
erning equation (Eq. (59)) involving the specified heatfunction
boundary conditions (see Section 2.6) was solved numerically using
the finite difference method over a wide range of Rayleigh number,
105 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 108, thermal conductivity ratio (0.44 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 23.8) and
solid wall thickness (0.1 (cid:3) tD (cid:3) 0.5). The heatline characteristics are
first illustrated for various Ra at tD 1⁄4 0:3 and Rk 1⁄4 1. At Ra 1⁄4 105;
the weak heatline cell is observed within nanofluid layer near the
upper half of the enclosure. The heatlines within the solid block are
almost straight and parallel to the adiabatic wall whereas, the dis-
torted heatlines are observed in the nanofluid bed depicting the
onset of convection (Figures not shown). At the higher Ra, the inten-
sity of heatlines is significantly increased and they occupy almost
the entire nanofluid layer. Hence, a large region near the core of the
nanofluid bed is maintained at uniform temperature (Figures not
shown). As the conductivity ratio (Rk) increases, the heatline cells
disappear and parallel end-to-end heatlines connect the horizontal

Pwalls (Figures not shown). At the high Rk, the gradient of the heat-
functions for the heatlines in the middle of the cavity is slightly
stronger than those near to the solid wall due to the high resistance
of the solid wall at the low conductivity (Figures not shown). For the
higher wall thickness (tD (cid:2) 0.3), a pair of asymmetric heatline cells
are observed in the nanofluid bed whereas parallel heatlines are sus-
tained in the solid block (Figures not shown). The benefits and limi-
tations of the presence of the solid block based on the extent of
thermal mixing and rate of heat transfer for nanofluids are clearly
illustrated via heatlines.

PMobedi [109] carried out natural convection studies in a square
cavity with the horizontal walls of the finite thickness (Fig. 4(I)(h)).
The vertical walls of the cavity are at different constant tempera-
tures while the outer surfaces of horizontal walls are insulated
(Fig. 4(I)(h)). The heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59)) was
numerically solved by the finite difference method using the appro-
priate heatfunction boundary conditions (see Section 2.6). The
steady state results are obtained for wide ranges of Rayleigh number
(103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106) and thermal conductivity ratio (Rk 1⁄4 1 and 50) for
Pr 1⁄4 0:71. Results are first illustrated at Ra 1⁄4 103 for various values
of Rk. At Rk 1⁄4 1; the weak heatline cell is found to occur near the
lower half of the enclosure whereas, the weak heatline cell disap-
pears for the case with Rk 1⁄4 50 (Figures not shown). As observed
earlier, the straight and parallel heatlines are observed within the
solid wall near the lower and upper halves at Rk 1⁄4 50 (Figures not
shown). The isotherms in the fluid region as well as in the solid walls
are nearly parallel to each other as convection heat transfer is poor
in the entire fluid domain at Ra 1⁄4 103; irrespective of Rk (Figures not
shown). Results are next discussed at Ra 1⁄4 106 for various values of
Rk. At the lower Rk, a large heatline cell is found to encompass the
fluid region of the cavity and hence, the end-to-end heatlines origi-
nating from the left wall are clustered towards the top half of the
enclosure. As Rk increases further to 50, the heatline cell is found to
shrink and conductive heatlines are largely dominant within the
cavity (Figures not shown). The strength of the heatline cell is
decreased and the magnitude of the conductive heatlines is largely
enhanced for the higher Rk (Rk 1⁄4 50) compared to Rk 1⁄4 1 (Figures
not shown). Due to the significant thermal mixing near the central
core, the isotherms are largely squeezed towards the side walls for
Rk 1⁄4 1 involving Ra 1⁄4 106. Note that, at Rk 1⁄4 1; the isotherms are
slightly distorted within the solid walls whereas, at Rk 1⁄4 50; the
temperature distribution in the horizontal walls is almost linear and
heat transfer is one dimensional (Figures not shown). Overall, similar
to the previous works [105(cid:1)108], the heatline features clearly illus-
trate that the thickness of the solid walls largely influences the heat
flow or heat circulation pattern within the enclosure.

PZhao et al. [110,111] investigated the fluid flow and heat transfer
in the building elements involving fluid filled square enclosures sur-
rounded by thick finite walls (Fig. 4(I)(i)). It may be noted that, the
square enclosure consists of a hot left wall, right cold wall and adia-
batic horizontal walls. In order to maintain the brevity of the review,
the numerical results of one representative work [111] are discussed
in detail. The governing heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) with the
appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions (see Section 2.6) was
solved via the finite volume method. The heatlines and isotherms

are obtained for various values of volume ratio scale (Vr 1⁄4 0

square enclosure. It was found that heat transfer is conduction domi-
nant at Ra 1⁄4 10 and 103 and that is clearly depicted by the end-to-
end heatlines (Figures not shown). At Ra 1⁄4 105; the unidirectional
convective heat circulation cells are found to expand near the central

Pcore of the enclosure (Figures not shown). The effect of Vr on heat
transfer within the square enclosure is illustrated at Ra 1⁄4 105 (Fig-
ures not shown). It is interesting to observe that the unicellular heat
B
circulation cells occur within the enclosure for Vr 1⁄4 0
(Figures
not shown). Note that, heat transfer is convection dominant within
the fluid filled square enclosure whereas conduction heat transfer
with parallel end-to-end heatlines dominates the rest of the enclo-
sure (Figures not shown). It is found that, as Vr increases beyond 60°,
the convective heatline circulation cells are reduced in size and the
vortex of the heatline cells shift towards the top wall (Figures not
shown). At the lower value of Vr, the multiple heatline cells can
appear. As Vr increase beyond 60°, the concentric circular heatline
cells with lesser intensities appear. For Vr > 75°, the heatline cells
disappear and only the end-to-end parallel horizontal heatlines are
found to dominate the entire square enclosure (Figures not shown).
Overall, the volume ratio scale (Vr) is a tuning parameter to maintain
conduction heat transport in specific zones. In addition, the heatline
trajectories dictate the value of the volume ratio scale to achieve a
well thermal mixing zone.

PCosta [112] numerically studied natural convection in partitioned
square enclosures filled with air. Two partitions of finite thickness
are considered and they are placed in the enclosure following an
ordered arrangement (Fig. 4(II)(a)). It may be noted that, both the
partitions are maintained adiabatic. Costa [112] considered the hori-
zontal walls to be either adiabatic (type I) or maintained at a specific
non-uniform temperature (cyclic, type II). The cyclic temperature
boundary was verified such that, uðX; 0Þ 1⁄4 uðX; 1Þ8X. A two-

Pdimensional laminar control-volume based finite element method
was used to solve the heatfunction governing equations (Eq. (59) for
the fluid phase and Eq. (83) for the solid phase) using the appropri-
ate heatfunction boundary conditions (see Section 2.6). The heat-
lines and isotherms are discussed for various values of thermal
conductivity ratio (Rk 1⁄4 ks=kf 1⁄4 0 (cid:1) 10) and for different thermal
boundary conditions (case 1: hot left and cold right wall, case 2: cold
left and hot right wall) at Ra 1⁄4 106 for Pr 1⁄4 0:71. Results are first
discussed for type I involving cases 1 and 2. For case 1, at Rk 1⁄4 0; L-
shaped heatline cells are formed near the left half of the enclosure
due to the presence of the partition on the left half of the bottom
wall. In addition, very few heatlines leaving the hot left wall reach at
the right cold wall depicting poor heat flow within the cavity. Due to
the weak heat circulation near the central core, stratified tempera-
ture zones are observed. For case 2 with Rk 1⁄4 0; the heatline cells
with multiple vortices are observed near the central portion of the
enclosure and the large amount of heat is transferred from the hot
right wall to the cold left wall due to the larger heat recirculation
compared to case 1. Consequently, the large temperature gradient is
observed along the upper half of the left wall and lower half of the
right wall for case 2. At the higher Rk (Rk 1⁄4 10), a pair of L-shaped
dense heatline cells are formed in each half of the square cavity for
case 1 (see Fig. 17(i)(a)) whereas the heatlines with multiple vortices
occupy the entire region between the partitions in the square cavity
for case 2 (see Fig. 17(ii)(a)). It may be noted that, the intensity of
the heatline cells in the left half is comparatively greater than that in
the right half for case 1 (see Fig. 17(i)(a)) whereas, the strength of

Pboth the heatline cells is found to be almost similar for case 2 (see
Fig. 17(ii)(a)). Overall, the intensity of the heat flow is comparatively
larger for case 2 than that for case 1 depicting larger thermal mixing
for case 2 (see Fig. 17(i and ii)(a)). Consequently, the temperature
gradient along the left wall is found to be slightly enhanced for case
2 compared to case 1 (see Fig. 17(i and ii)(a)). Results are next illus-
trated for the type II involving cases 1 and 2 at Rk 1⁄4 10. It is found
that heatline and isotherm distributions for the type II exhibit almost
identical patterns as that of type I near the interior region of the
enclosure irrespective of cases 1 and 2. However, slight changes
occur near the horizontal walls of the enclosure, as heat is being
transferred in that region for the type II boundary condition. As the
horizontal walls are maintained at identical temperatures, a few
end-to-end heatlines emanating from the left (case 1) or right (case
2) wall end on the horizontal walls. Overall, the effect of the partition
on the thermal management within a square enclosure is success-
fully illustrated via the heatline trajectories.

PHu et al. [44] numerically investigated conjugate natural convec-
tion heat transfer within a differentially heated square enclosure
with rectangular obstacles of equal volume attached along the
horizontal walls
(Fig. 4(II)(b)). The governing heatfunction
equations (Eqs. (52a) and (52b) for fluid media and Eqs. (84a) and
(84b) for solid media) were solved using the finite volume method
using the appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions based on
the Section 2.6. The heat flow and temperature distributions within
the enclosures were analyzed for a wide range of parameters such
as Rayleigh number (106 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 107), solid to fluid volume ratio
(g 1⁄4 0:36 and 0.64), number of rectangular obstacles (NA D 8, 10, 12,
14) and thermal conductivity ratio (0.1 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 10) for Pr 1⁄4 0:71.
Results are first illustrated for various NA with Rk 1⁄4 1 and g 1⁄4 0:36
at Ra 1⁄4 106. It is interesting to observe that the strong convective
primary heatline cells occur near the central core of the enclosure
leading to the distorted isotherms. At NA 1⁄4 8; multiple convective
heatline cells are found to occur near the gap within the obstacles in
the top and bottom halves of the square cavity (see Fig. 17(i)(b)).
Fig. 17(i)(b) also depicts that the heatlines are clustered near the
central regime of the cavity and a few small heatline circulation cells
surrounded by the heatline trajectories occur at the central zone.
Due to the dense heatlines, the isotherms are slightly distorted near
the central regime of the cavity (see Fig. 17(i)(b)). As NA increases to
14, the end-to-end heatlines span the entire upper half of the cavity
whereas the tiny heatline cells are sustained near the obstacle gaps
especially in the left half of the bottom regime within the square
cavity (see Fig. 17(ii)(b)). It is observed that, the large horizontally
skewed heat circulation cells encompass the entire central regime of
the cavity and the vortex of the heatline cell is located near the left
half of the central core (see Fig. 17(ii)(b)). Note that, the isotherms
for NA 1⁄4 14 exhibit almost similar features as those for NA 1⁄4 8 (see
Fig. 17(i and ii)(b)). The heatline characteristics at Ra 1⁄4 107 clearly
depict that the intensity of the heatline cells is enhanced and they
expand horizontally near the central core. The intense heatline cells
are found to occur near the obstacle gaps even for the higher NA at
Ra 1⁄4 107. The isotherms for Ra 1⁄4 107 are found to be qualitatively
similar to those for Ra 1⁄4 106. The effect of the partition-fluid ther-
mal conductivity ratio, Rk is also studied and it is found that the solid
obstacles with the low thermal conductivity lead to high resistance
on the heat flow. Consequently, the intensity of the heat flow in the
enclosure is found to be lesser and that is depicted by the weaker
heatline cells. As Rk increases, the intense heatline cells are found to
occur inside the obstacle gaps of the enclosure. As g increases to
0.64, the conduction heat transfer becomes predominant in almost
90% of the enclosure as indicated by the parallel isotherms and heat-
lines. Overall, the heatline studies clearly demonstrate that the recir-
culation of heat decreases near the central core of the cavities
especially for the higher NA and g. The solid obstacles in the fluid
medium can appear in various processing applications (electronics

Por semiconductor) and the heatline trajectories are found to be
indispensable to decide the optimal number of obstacles for conduc-
tion or convection dominant transport.

PLaminar natural convection and conduction in enclosures divided
by a partition with different thicknesses is investigated numerically
by Koca et al. [113]. It may be noted that, the thickness of the lower
portion of the partition is greater than the thickness of the top por-
tion of the partition as shown in Fig. 4(II)(c). The thickness ratio of
the partition (s) is defined as the ratio of the thicknesses of the bot-
tom and top portions of the partition. The cavity is differentially
heated from the left vertical wall and cooled from the right, while
the top and bottom walls are adiabatic (Fig. 4(II)(c)). The cavity
is assumed to be filled with air (Pr 1⁄4 0:71). The finite difference
method was
governing
equations (Eq. (59) for the fluid media and (83) for the solid media)
using the appropriate heatfunction boundary conditions (see Sec-
tion 2.6). The problem was solved for different values of Rayleigh
number (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106), thickness ratio of the partition (2 (cid:3) s (cid:3) 4),
and thermal conductivity ratio (0.1 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 10.0). At Ra 1⁄4 103; the
heatlines are parallel to the horizontal walls, showing almost one-
dimensional heat transfer from the hot to cold plate (Figures not
shown). As Ra increases further to 105 and 106, the intense heat cir-
culation cells appear in the left half and the secondary heat circula-
tion cells are found to occur along the right half of the enclosure
(Figures not shown). Consequently, the isotherms are largely dis-
torted throughout the enclosure except the solid partition where
smooth isotherms are observed due to conductive effect. The heat-
lines and isotherms do not show any significant variation with the
thickness ratio of partition (s). It is interesting to observe that the
intensity of the heat circulation cell in the left half decreases with Rk
whereas the strength of the secondary heat circulation cell
is
enhanced in the right half of the enclosure at Ra 1⁄4 106 (Figures not
shown). Note that, the isotherms are distributed as parallel to the
vertical walls inside the partition for the lower values of Rk whereas
the distorted isotherms are found to dominate throughout the enclo-
sure for the higher values of Rk (Figures not shown). Common to all
cases, the heatlines clearly illustrate that two separate thermal mix-
ing zones are observed in the cavity due to the partition and the
intensity of the heat circulation cell in the left half is significantly
higher compared to the right half (Figures not shown). The heatlines
can be used to forecast heating patterns for various values of s and
Rk.

PThe effects of a ceiling-mounted barrier on natural convection
heat transfer in a differentially heated square cavity (Fig. 4(II)(d))
are numerically investigated by Ilis et al. [114]. The finite difference
governing
method was
equation (Eq. (59)) using the appropriate heatfunction boundary
conditions (see Section 2.6). Numerical study was performed for var-
ious values of the position of the barrier along the top wall
(0.125 (cid:3) Xb (cid:3) 0.875; Xb is the position of the barrier on the top wall
whose dimensionless length is 1) over a wide range of Rayleigh
numbers (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106). The barrier is assumed to have very low
thermal conductivity. At Ra 1⁄4 103; the heatlines and isotherms are
found to be qualitatively similar to those observed in previous works
[44,112,113]. At Ra 1⁄4 106; the intense heatline cells occur within the
cavity depicting intense convection, irrespective of Xb (Figures not
shown). Common to any position of the barrier, the heatline cells are
protruded by the presence of the barrier. Consequently, the position
of the barrier plays a significant role to break or distort the heatline
cells remarkably. The heatline features for Xb 1⁄4 0:125 clearly illus-
trate that the heatline cells span the entire right half of the cavity
and the vortex of the heatline cell occurs very close to the barrier
just below the top wall (Figures not shown). It is found that the pres-
ence of the barrier near the middle portion of the top wall (Xb 1⁄4 0:5)
results in the segregation of the heatline cells (Figures not shown).

Pthe square enclosure and the center of the vortex of the heatline cell
is located very close to the left wall. The barrier acts as an indicator
to deform the heatline trajectories such that the density of the heat-
lines along the side walls leading to the desired heat transfer rates,
can be easily controlled (Figures not shown). In addition, the heat-
line features clearly demonstrate the formation of two distinct ther-
mal mixing zones within the cavity for Xb 1⁄4 0:5 whereas a single
thermal mixing zone is observed within the cavity for Xb 1⁄4 0:125
and 0.875.

PThe classical problem of the differential heating of a square
enclosure with a solid conducting body at the core (Fig. 4(III)(a)) was
numerically studied by various authors [30,110,111,115,116]. In
order to maintain the brevity of the review, numerical studies are
discussed only for the work carried out by Zhao et al. [111]. The gov-
erning heatfunction equation (Eq. (59)) along with the appropriate
heatfunction boundary conditions based on Section 2.6 was solved
using the finite volume method. Numerical studies were carried out
B
for Pr 1⁄4 0:71. The effect of the volume ratio scale (Vr 1⁄4 0
) on
the heat flow within the enclosure was studied in detail for Rk 1⁄4 1
and Ra 1⁄4 105. It is interesting to observe that the unicellular heat
B
circulation cell occurs within the enclosure for Vr 1⁄4 0
. The
end-to-end heatlines appear at the upper portion for Vr (cid:3) 45°. It may
be noted that, convection is found to be largely dominant within the
B
entire enclosure for Vr 1⁄4 0
as exhibited by the intense convec-
tive heatline cells. However, as Vr increases beyond 45°, the convec-
tive heat circulation cells are reduced in size and they are squeezed
towards the bottom left half of the enclosure (Figures not shown).
For Vr > 75°, the heatline cells disappear and only the end-to-end
heatlines are observed to dominate the entire square enclosure (Fig-
ures not shown). Overall, the heatlines illustrate that the increase in
Vr results in the dominance of conduction throughout the enclosure.
A few interesting features of the heatlines can also be explained for
the different values of Ra (103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106). At the low Rayleigh num-
ber (Ra 1⁄4 103), the heatlines exhibit the smooth parallel
lines
throughout the cavity and they signify the dominance of conduction
(Figures not shown). As Ra further increases to 106, the intense heat-
line cells are found to encompass the solid body. Consequently, the
wall to wall heatlines are found to be sharply squeezed towards the
top half of the square cavity (Figures not shown). The effects of the
thermal conductivity ratio, Rk (0.1 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 10) were also studied on
the heatline distribution within the cavity at Ra 1⁄4 106. At the lower
Rk (Rk 1⁄4 0:1 and 0.4), very few heatlines are found in the solid body
due to the lesser dominance of conduction (Figures not shown). As
Rk increases to 10, the conductivity ratio increases and hence, many
heatlines are observed inside the solid body (Figures not shown).
Overall, the heatlines clearly explain that the size and thermal con-
ductivity of the solid body largely determine the overall thermal
management in the cavity. The heatlines also demonstrate that the
thermal mixing zones disappear from the square cavity for the
greater size of the solid conducting body.

PThe inverse conjugate natural convection problem with multiple
unknown heating fluxes was studied by Zhang et al. [45] (Fig. 4(III)
(b)) within a square enclosure consisting of a solid block near the
core. The top and bottom walls of the square enclosure are main-
tained cold whereas, the boundary heat fluxes corresponding to Qu1
1⁄4 (cid:1)sinðpYÞ and Qu2 1⁄4 (cid:1)sinð2pYÞ are maintained along the left and
right walls, respectively (Fig. 4(III)(b)). The governing heatfunction
equations (Eqs. (52a) and (52b)) along with the appropriate heat-
function boundary conditions (see Section 2.6) were solved using
the finite volume method. The effect of thermal Rayleigh number
(103 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106), size of the solid block (0.2 (cid:3) B (cid:3) 0.8) and thermal
conductivity ratio (0.2 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 10) on the heat flow patterns within
the fluid (Pr 1⁄4 0:72) filled enclosure was studied in detail. At the
lower Ra (Ra 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 104), natural convection is weak and heat
transfer within the enclosure occurs mainly by thermal conduction
(Figures not shown). The end-to-end smooth heatlines are found to

Pconnect the hot side walls and the cold horizontal walls. As Ra
increases to 106, the heatlines demonstrate clearly the existence of
distinct vertical boundary layer region along the side walls and heat
transfer inside the enclosure is dominated by the thermal convection
(Figures not shown). Note that, the closed loop heatline cells occur
adjacent to the top corner region of the solid block and in the vicinity
near the top half of the left wall (Figures not shown). The size of the
solid block (0.2 (cid:3) B (cid:3) 0.8) is also found to have significant effect on
the heatline features within the square enclosure. For the lower
block size (0.2 (cid:3) B (cid:3) 0.4), it is observed that, majority of the heat
transport occurs from the right wall to a large zone of the top and
bottom walls (Figures not shown). In addition, a few heatlines ema-
nating from the right wall end on the left wall. On the other hand,
the heat flux from the left wall is restricted to a narrow region in the
extreme left corners of the horizontal walls (Figures not shown). It is
also observed that, a few heatlines connect the upper and lower por-
tions of the left wall. As the size of the solid block increases (B (cid:2) 0.6),
heat flow from both the walls is further restricted to the extreme
corner regions of the horizontal wall and consequently, the middle
portion of the horizontal walls receives comparatively lesser heat
(Figures not shown). It is interesting to observe that the heatline fea-
tures do not vary significantly for the higher values of Rk except for
the fact that the heat transport via conduction occurs through the
solid for the higher value of Rk (Figures not shown). Zhang et al. [45]
also studied the effect of the number of blocks (NB 1⁄4 1; 4 and 9) on
the heat flow pattern inside the cavity and that has been discussed
later.

PLima and Ganzarolli [117] used the heatline approach in order to
analyze role of the central solid body on overall heat transfer rates in
a square enclosure. The square enclosure is subjected to isothermal
heating of the bottom wall and isothermal cooling of the left wall
(Fig. 4(III)(c)). The top and right walls of the enclosure are main-
tained adiabatic (Fig. 4(III)(c)). The effect of the square body on the
steady state heat transfer in the enclosure was investigated for Pr 1⁄4
0:71 over a wide range of Ra (104 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 106) and the ratio of the
thermal conductivities of the solid and fluid media (1 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 100). In
another case, the square body is maintained adiabatic. The finite vol-
ume method was used to solve the heatfunction governing equa-
tion [117] with the heatfunction boundary conditions
(see
Section 2.6). Results are first illustrated for the various values of Rk
at Ra (cid:2) 105. Common to all the cases, the energy flow occurs across a
path which connects the enclosure wall to the solid body (Figures
not shown). At the lower Rk (Rk 1⁄4 1), very few heatlines connect the
bottom hot wall and left cold wall via the solid block. However, as Rk
increases to 100, significant number of heatlines connect the bottom
wall and left wall via the solid body (Figures not shown). This may
be explained based on the enhanced rate of conduction heat transfer
at the higher values of Rk. The heatline trajectories are end-to-end
type for the higher values of Rk with larger solid bodies. A critical
size of the central square body can be obtained based on the fact
that the Nusselt number of the wall of the enclosure remains invari-
ant beyond the critical size of the square body. The heatline trajecto-
ries are found to be the only thermal management avenue to
promote conduction dominant heat transport at any Ra via regulat-
ing the size and thermal conductivity of the central solid body within
the cavity. On the other hand, the effect of the adiabatic block at the
center of the cavity is also found promising. The role of the size of
the central adiabatic block on the central heatline eddy and heatline
trajectories near the walls was investigated. In general, the heatline
circulation cells appear at the center in the absence of any solid
block as explained for convection with various all boundary condi-
tions (see Section 4.1). The heatline eddies as well as heatline trajec-
tories near the wall remain unaffected for an adiabatic block with
small size at the center and the critical size can be determined based
on the average Nusselt number values at the wall. The center of the
heatline circulation cell or eddy detects a thermally inactive zone

Pwhere the placement of the adiabatic body does not affect the over-
all heat transfer process. The thermally inactive zone implies that
the heatline trajectories do not emanate from that zone to deliver
heat at other cooler parts. The heatline analysis of small adiabatic
block vs large conducting block within the cavity provides the strate-
gies for thermal processing. The location of thermally inactive zone
and the critical size of the adiabatic device with online measure-
ments are the direct consequences of the heatline trajectories. On
the other hand, the heatline approach can be used to develop corre-
lations to predict the maximum size of a solid obstacle which can be
placed within fluid in the presence of natural convection without
disturbing the heat transfer rate.

PHu et al. [44] also numerically investigated conjugate natural
convection heat transfer within a differentially heated square enclo-
sure with solid square obstacles of equal volume as given in Fig. 4
(III)(d), similar to those used in the electronic cooling industries. The
fluid flow, heat flow and temperature distribution within the enclo-
sures involving square obstacles are analyzed for a wide range of
parameters such as thermal Rayleigh number (106 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 107), solid
to fluid volume ratio (g 1⁄4 0:36 and 0.64), number of square
obstacles (NB D 16, 25, 36, 49) and thermal conductivity ratio
(0.1 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 10). Interesting features of the heat flow are observed
within the enclosure at Ra 1⁄4 106 and g 1⁄4 0:36 for various values of
NB. Fig. 17(i)(c) depicts the heatline and isotherm distributions
within the square cavity for NB 1⁄4 16. It is observed that, multiple
heatline cells encompass the solid obstacles throughout the cavity
(see Fig. 17(i)(c)). This is in contrast to the case involving the rectan-
gular obstacles (NA), where the convective heatline cells are found to
occur near the gap within the obstacles (see the discussion for Fig. 4
(II)(b)). It is also found that the dense heatlines emanating from the
lower half of the left wall, travel through the obstacle gaps in the top
half and end on the upper portion of the right wall (see Fig. 17(i)(c)).
Hence, the dense heatlines are observed near the regime in the vicin-
ity of the left wall and also within the obstacle gaps in the top half of
the square enclosure (see Fig. 17(i)(c)). As seen in earlier cases, the
isotherms form slightly higher temperature gradient near the lower
half of the left wall and top half of the right wall (see Fig. 17(i)(c)). It
may be noted that, the isotherms tend to become vertical and dense
heatlines penetrate through the obstacles as NB increases to 49 (see
Fig. 17(ii)(c)). Similar to NB 1⁄4 16; multiple convective heatline cells
are found to occur in the cavity and the large convective heatline
cells encompass the square obstacles near the middle zone (see
Fig. 17(ii)(c)). Overall, it is observed that, the strength of the heatline
circulation cells is found to be decreased with NB (see Fig. 17(i and ii)
(c)). Zhang et al. [45] also studied the effect of the increasing number
of solid blocks in the square enclosure subjected to the sinusoidal
heat flux (see Fig. 4(III)(b)) on the vertical wall with the isothermal
cooling of the horizontal wall at Ra 1⁄4 104. Fig. 17(i and ii)(d) illus-
trate that the end-to-end heatlines only occur in the square cavity
and isotherms form circular arcs along the hot wall [45].

PThe heatline features are next discussed at Ra 1⁄4 107 [44]. It is
found that heatlines leave the left hot wall from a narrow region in
the lower half, and reaches the right cold wall in its upper half (Fig-
ures not shown). In addition, the intensity of the heatline cells is
found to be enhanced and they expand horizontally near the central
core compared to Ra 1⁄4 106. It may be noted that the heatline cells
encompass a larger zone near the core of the cavity for Ra 1⁄4 107
(Figures not shown) compared to Ra 1⁄4 106 especially for the larger
number of blocks (NB 1⁄4 49). Common to all NB, it is found that a few
heatlines pass through the solid obstacles compared to Ra 1⁄4 106
and heat is almost transferred through the narrow channels between
the solid obstacles (Figures not shown). The heatlines clearly dem-
onstrate that the heat transfer rate in the enclosure is found to
decrease with the number of solid obstacles (NB). It is also observed
that the isotherms cluster near the lower left and upper right
regions, and that further shows that temperature gradient near the

Pwalls increases with Ra (Figures not shown). The effect of the solid-
fluid thermal conductivity ratio (Rk) was also studied on the heat
flow through the square obstacles. It was found that the square
obstacles of the low thermal conductivity leads to the high resis-
tance on heat flow and consequently, the intensity of heat flow is
found to be lesser (Figures not shown). Similar to the case involving
the rectangular obstacles (NA), more heatlines are found to pass
through the square obstacles for the higher Rk. As g (solid to fluid
volume ratio) increases to 0.64, the conduction heat transfer effect
becomes predominant in almost 90% of both the enclosures as indi-
cated by the parallel isotherms and heatlines, irrespective of NB and
Rk (Figures not shown). Overall, the heatlines will be useful to govern
the path of the heat flow for multiple electronic components in a
system. The heatline trajectories in the presence of multiple square
blocks may be useful to design a realistic electronic configuration
assembly to optimize the heat flow and heat transfer rate within the
system.

PBasak and co-workers carried out mixed convection lid driven
flow within fluid [118] or porous medium [119] filled square enclo-
sure involving various thermal boundary conditions (case 1: the bot-
tom wall is uniformly heated whereas the side walls are maintained
cold, case 2: the bottom wall is non-uniformly heated in the pres-
ence of the cold side walls, case 3: both the side walls are linearly
heated in the presence of the uniformly heated bottom wall and
case 4: the linearly heated left wall in the presence of the cold right
wall and uniformly heated bottom wall) as seen in Fig. 5(a). Mixed
convection is employed via moving the top lid in the positive x direc-
tion. The heatfunction governing equation (Eq. (59)) along with the
various heatfunction boundary condition (see Eqs. (91a) and (91b))
was solved using the Galerkin finite element method. In order to
maintain the brevity of the review, numerical studies involving
mixed convection within lid driven porous enclosure [119] are
discussed in this section. The effect of the parameters such as Darcy
(Gr 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105),
number
Prandtl
number
(Re 1⁄4 1 (cid:1) 100) is discussed next. Results are first illustrated for cases
1 and 2 (Figures not shown). At the high Da, the eye of the heat circu-
lation cells is stretched along the corner region indicating intense
convection (Figures not shown). Further, the symmetric distribution
of the heatlines is observed and the thickness of the thermal bound-
ary layer decreases along the side walls with Da (Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3) for the
higher Pr at the low Re. Dominant lid driven effects are observed at
the larger Re, irrespective of Da and the thermal boundary layer is
confined to the bottom and left walls as observed from the dense
heatlines in cases 1 and 2 (Figures not shown). However, for cases 3
and 4, the heatlines are parallel for smaller values of Gr and Ra at the
low Da. On the other hand, the heatlines as well as isotherms near
the top wall tend to be non-symmetric for all Da values correspond-
ing to the high values of Gr and Re. Multiple heatline circulation cells
are observed for Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)3 and Pr 1⁄4 7:2 at Gr 1⁄4 105 and the iso-
therms are found to be highly non-symmetric (Figures not shown).
Smaller thermal boundary layer thickness is observed at the top por-
tion of the right wall based on larger gradients of heatfunctions, for
higher Re and Gr irrespective of Da in case 3 (Figures not shown). It
is also interesting to find the existence of the large heatline circula-
tion cell near the right wall accompanied by small heatline circula-
tion cell near the top left corner at the higher Da, Gr and Pr for case
4. The large heatline circulation cell near the right wall leads to the
compressed isotherms at the right wall for case 4 (Figures not
shown). The heatline approach was effective in explaining the lesser
recirculation of heat in the cavity at the higher Re irrespective of Gr,
Da and Pr. Overall, the heatlines demonstrate that the motion of the
top lid significantly alters the heatline circulation cells in the

Ppresence of various types of thermal boundary conditions. The ther-
mal mixing zone involving convective heatline circulation cells can
be tuned based on various parameters (Re, Gr and Da) and thermal
boundary conditions.

PBasak and co-workers [120,121] also investigated mixed convec-
tion heat transfer within fluid [120] or porous [121] medium filled
square cavities for various thermal boundary conditions at the bot-
tom and side walls (see Fig. 5(a)) based on different values of the
thermal aspect ratio (uA). Mixed convection is induced via moving
the top lid in the positive x direction. As the thermal aspect ratio (uA)
varies from 0 to 1, various thermal boundary conditions are imposed
on the bottom and side walls, such as uA 1⁄4 0 corresponds to the sinu-
soidally heated bottom wall and cold side walls whereas uA 1⁄4 1 corre-
sponds to the uniformly heated bottom wall and linearly heated side
walls. The Galerkin finite element method was used to solve the heat-
function equation (Eq. (59)) with various heatfunction boundary con-
ditions (see Eqs. (91a), (91b)) for a wide range of parameters
(Re 1⁄4 1 (cid:1) 100; Pr 1⁄4 0:015 (cid:1) 10; Da 1⁄4 10(cid:1)5 (cid:1) 10(cid:1)3Gr 1⁄4 103 (cid:1) 105;
uA 1⁄4 0:1 (cid:1) 0:9). Overall, it is found that the larger thermal mixing
results in the larger temperature uniformity near the central core of
the enclosure for uA 1⁄4 0:1 and 0.5 compared to uA 1⁄4 0:9 and the
effect is more prominent especially at the high Gr [120] and Da [121]
irrespective of Pr (Figures not shown). Overall, the heatline analysis
clearly infers that the suitable choice of uA is beneficial in describing
the path of the dense heat flow and various local thermal mixing zones
designated by the multiple heat circulation cells.

PRoy et al. [122,123] studied the role of various moving walls on
energy transfer rates via the heat flow visualization during mixed
convection in fluid [122] and porous media [123] filled square cavi-
ties. In order to maintain the brevity of the review, numerical studies
on mixed convection are discussed only within the porous square
cavity [123]. The simulations were carried out for two cases based
on the motion of the horizontal wall(s) [case 1a: the top wall moving
in the right direction, case 1b: the bottom wall moving in the left
direction, case 1c: the top and bottom walls moving simultaneously
in the opposite directions, case 1d: top and bottom walls moving
simultaneously in the same direction (see Fig. 5(b)) or vertical wall
(s) (case 2a: the left wall moving in the top direction, case 2b: the
left and right walls moving in the opposite directions, case 2c: the
left and right walls moving in the same direction; see Fig. 5(c)). Note
that, cases 1a-1d and 2a-2c involve the isothermally heated bottom
wall, cold side wall and adiabatic top wall. The Galerkin finite ele-
ment method was used to solve the heatfunction equation (Eq. (59))
using various heatfunction boundary conditions (see Eqs. (91a),
(91b)). The heat flow distribution within the cavity was analyzed for
various dimensionless numbers involving the effective properties in
the presence of the porous medium, Prandtl number (Prm 1⁄4 Pr=(cid:2); Pr
denotes Prandtl number and (cid:2) depicts the porosity), Prm 1⁄4 0:026 (cid:1)
7:2; Reynolds number, Re 1⁄4 10 (cid:1) 100 and modified Darcy number
(Dam 1⁄4 Da=(cid:2); Da denotes Darcy number and (cid:2) depicts the porosity),
Dam 1⁄4 10(cid:1)4 (cid:1) 10(cid:1)2 at Gr 1⁄4 105. Results are first discussed for cases
1a-1d involving various values of Re, Dam and Prm (Figures not
shown). At the low Prm (Prm 1⁄4 0:026), the end-to-end heatlines are
observed in all the cases irrespective of Dam and Re (Figures not
shown). The heatlines are largely dispersed near the top portion of
the side walls resulting in the large boundary layer thickness in all
the cases (Figures not shown). A pair of the asymmetric heatline cells
are observed in all the cases at Dam 1⁄4 10(cid:1)2; Re 1⁄4 10 and Prm 1⁄4 7:2.
The heatline features of cases 1a and 1d clearly demonstrate that the
size of the heatline cell is found to be higher on the right half of the
cavity whereas the larger size of the heatline cell is observed along
the left half of the cavity for cases 1b and 1c at Dam 1⁄4 10(cid:1)2 involving
Re 1⁄4 10 and Prm 1⁄4 7:2. As Re increases to 100, a large heatline cell is
accompanied by small circulation cells which are strong functions of
cases 1a-1d (Figures not shown). The heatline characteristics are
explained in details for cases 1a-1d for Re 1⁄4 100 at Dam 1⁄4 10(cid:1)2 and

PPrm 1⁄4 7:2. The heatline features of case 1a display the formation of a
large clockwise primary heatline cell which spans a large portion of
the enclosure. Due to the static top wall in case 1b, the buoyancy
force tends to be dominant leading to the anticlockwise heatline cell
to grow in the left half of the cavity and the anticlockwise heatline
cell further impinges the primary heatline cell in the right half (Fig-
ures not shown). For case 1c, the clockwise heatline cell expands
throughout the top and bottom walls due to the motion of top and
bottom walls in the opposite directions. The heatline features for
case 1d display the elongated secondary heatline cells near the bot-
tom wall due to the motion of the bottom wall whereas the primary
heatline cell occurs near the top half of the cavity. Similar to cases
1a-1d, the end-to-end heatlines are observed for cases 2a-2c at Prm
1⁄4 0:026 irrespective of Dam and Re (Figures not shown). However,
interesting heatline features are observed at Prm 1⁄4 7:2 involving D
am 1⁄4 10(cid:1)2 and Re 1⁄4 100. For case 2a, tiny secondary heatline cells
are observed along the top portion of the left wall due to its vertical
motion of the left wall whereas asymmetric heatline cells occur near
the core. The heatline features for case 2b display the formation of a
large heatline cell in the right half and that expands horizontally
resulting in the formation of secondary heatline cells near the top
and bottom corner regions in the left half (Figures not shown). The
heatline features for case 2c are almost similar to those for case 2a
except the fact that tiny secondary heatline cells are absent near the
left wall for case 2c (Figures not shown). Overall, a larger zone of uni-
form temperature is observed near the core of the square cavity for
cases 1a-1d and 2a-2c at the higher values of Prm, Re and Dam indi-
cating the larger thermal mixing (Figures not shown). The heatline
approach is effective in explaining the effect of the various wall
movements on the heat flow in the cavities and the heatline features
clearly illustrate the formation of the greater number of thermal
mixing zones for cases 1a-1d (horizontal wall movement) compared
to cases 2a-2c (vertical wall movement). Overall, the heatlines
clearly illustrate that the various types of movement of walls are
effective in controlling the thermal mixing zones within the cavity.

PCosta and Raimundo [124] studied mixed convection in a differ-
entially heated square enclosure with a rotating cylinder located
near the center of the enclosure (see Fig. 5(d)). The control volume
based finite element method was used to solve the heatfunction
equation (Eqs. (93a), (93b), (94)) with the appropriate heatfunction
boundary conditions as given in Section 2.7 (Eqs. (95a), (95b)).
Numerical results were reported for a wide range of the dimension-
less rotating velocity (Vv 1⁄4 vL2
; where L is the height of the cavity
af
and af is thermal diffusivity of the fluid; (cid:1)1000(cid:3)Vv(cid:3)1000; ‘ - ’
denotes the clockwise direction and ‘ + ’ denotes the anti-clockwise
direction), geometrical aspect ratio (0.1 (cid:3) Ra (cid:3) 0.4; Ra is defined as
the ratio of the radius of the cylinder and height of the square cav-
ity), thermal conductivity ratio of solid and fluid (1 (cid:3) Rk (cid:3) 10) and

heat capacity ratio [1 (cid:3) Rc (cid:3) 10; Rc 1⁄4

where r is the density

and Cp is the heat capacity of the solid (s) or fluid (f)] for the cylinder
within the square enclosure containing fluid (Pr 1⁄4 0:7) at Ra 1⁄4 105.
Results are first discussed at Rc 1⁄4 Rk 1⁄4 1 for (cid:1)500(cid:3)Vv(cid:3)500 at Ra 1⁄4
0:4 (Fig. 18(a)(cid:1)(d)). As the cylindrical cavity rotates in the clockwise
direction (Vv 1⁄4 (cid:1)500), the convective heat circulation cells sur-
round the cylinder, concentric heatline circles occur within the cyl-
inder and heat is transferred to the cold right wall in the clockwise
direction (Fig. 18(a)). Due to the intense convection, the isotherms
are largely compressed towards the central portion of the vertical
wall. At Vv 1⁄4 500; the natural convection and rotating effects
oppose to each other with a flow motion in the clockwise direction.
The parallel concentric circular heatlines are prevalent only within
the cylinder (Fig. 18(b)). A few anti-clockwise heatline cells surround
the cylinder denoting circular heat path due to the motion of

Pcells are found to occur near the four corners of the square enclosure
and a few heatlines penetrate from four corners to the cylinder. The
concentric circular heatlines are observed with the cylinder. In gen-
eral, at Rk 1⁄4 10; the end-to-end heatlines are major heat transport
avenues. The heatline features are also discussed for Rc 1⁄4 10 at Rk 1⁄4
10 and Vv 1⁄4 500 (Fig. 18(d)). At Rc 1⁄4 10; the secondary heat circula-
tion cells disappear and concentric circular heatlines prevail only
within the cylindrical cavity. As Ra decreases to 0.2, the heat flow is
largely increased from the left wall to the right wall and hence, the
larger heatfunction gradient is prevalent along the left wall especially
for the higher Rk and lower Rc involving (cid:1)500(cid:3)Vv(cid:3)500 (Figures not
shown). The heatline results are further discussed for Vv 1⁄4 (cid:1)1000
and 1000 at Rc 1⁄4 Rk 1⁄4 1 and Ra 1⁄4 0:1. Due to the lesser size of the
cylinder (Ra 1⁄4 0:1) and greater rotating velocity ((cid:1)1000(cid:3)Vv(cid:3)1000),
the strength of the heatline cells is enhanced and that further results
in significant amount of heat to be transferred from the left wall to the
right wall (Fig. 18(e), (f)). Although the end-to-end heatline patterns
are almost similar for Vv 1⁄4 (cid:1)1000 and 1000, the slight variation is
observed in shape of the heatline cell near the core. Note that, the mul-
tiple crescent shaped vortices are observed for Vv 1⁄4 1000 (Fig. 18(f))
whereas, the heatline cell is unicellular for Vv 1⁄4 (cid:1)1000 (Fig. 18(e)).
Overall, the heatline is found to be an indispensable tool for demon-
strating the variation in energy flow distribution for various magni-
tudes of rotating velocities for the inner cylinder. Also, the heatlines
demonstrate the change in the location of the single or multiple ther-
mal mixing zones or fully conduction zone or heat barrier in the cavity
for different values of Vv, Rc, Rk and Ra.

PKhorasanizadeh et al. [125] numerically studied mixed convec-
tion within lid driven square cavity filled with Cu-water nanofluid or
pure water. The horizontal walls of the cavity are adiabatic while the
left vertical wall is maintained isothermally hot and the right vertical
wall is maintained isothermally cold (see Fig. 5(e)). The top wall
moves from the left to right at a constant speed. The heatfunctions
were obtained using Eqs. (97a) and (97b) (Section 2.7). Numerical
results in terms of the heatlines are obtained for Ra 1⁄4 104 (cid:1) 106 and
Re 1⁄4 1 (cid:1) 100 involving nanofluid (f 1⁄4 0:05; f signifies the volume
fraction of the Cu nanoparticles in fluid) and pure fluid (f 1⁄4 0). At
Re 1⁄4 1 and Ra 1⁄4 104; the heatline cells of the lesser magnitude
occur within the square cavity and the end-to-end heatlines connect
the left and right walls via the upper half of the cavity, irrespective
of f (Figures not shown). It may be noted that, the heatline cells
near the core are oval or elliptical in shape for both f 1⁄4 0:05 and 0.
The intensity of the heatline cells is also found to be slightly higher for
f 1⁄4 0:05 compared to f 1⁄4 0 (Figures not shown). At the higher Ra
(Ra 1⁄4 106) and Re 1⁄4 1; the heatline cells are found to expand near the
core and they take the shape of the square cavity. In addition, the
intensity of the heatline cells is increased at Ra 1⁄4 106 for both f
(f 1⁄4 0:05 and 0). Similar to Ra 1⁄4 104; the intensity of the heat flow is
found to be slightly higher for the nanofluid in contrast to the base
fluid (Figures not shown). At Re 1⁄4 100 and Ra 1⁄4 104; the intensity of
the heatline cells is increased significantly for both the values of f
(f 1⁄4 0 and 0.05) and the heatlines are found to be denser near the
driving lid due to the larger effects of forced convection (Figures not
shown). However, the intensity of the heat flow is found to be higher
for the base fluid (f 1⁄4 0) compared to the nanofluid and that con-
trasts the heatline features at Re 1⁄4 1. At Re 1⁄4 100 and Ra 1⁄4 106; the
intense heat circulation near the central core results in compressed
isotherms along the left and top walls (Figures not shown). Also, the
heatline vortex is found to occur near the top wall at Re 1⁄4 100 and
Ra 1⁄4 106 and that contrasts the heatline features at Re 1⁄4 1. Similar to
Ra 1⁄4 104; the intensity of the heat flow is higher for the nanofluid
(f 1⁄4 0:05) compared to the base fluid (f 1⁄4 0). Overall, the heatlines
demonstrate the role of the moving lid for nanofluids and base fluid.
The heatline trajectories also demonstrate that the thermal mixing at
the core as well as heat transfer rate at the wall can be enhanced for
nanofluids at specific values of Re and Ra.

right wall in the anti-clockwise direction. Similar to Vv 1⁄4 (cid:1)500; the
isotherms are largely compressed near the middle portion of the
side walls in the square cavity. The heatline characteristics are next
discussed for Rk 1⁄4 10 at Rc 1⁄4 1 and Vv 1⁄4 500 (Fig. 18(c)). Note that,

PBiswas et al. [126] used the heatline concept in order to exhibit
the enhanced or preferential heat flow using central adiabatic block
within the lid-driven differentially heated fluid (Pr 1⁄4 0:71) filled
square cavity (see Fig. 5(f)). Three cases with respect to the move-
ment of the left and right walls are considered (case 1: the left wall
moving up and right wall moving down, case 2: the left wall moving
down and right wall moving up, case 3: both the side walls moving
up). The heatfunction governing equations (Eqs. 90a and b) sub-
jected to the boundary conditions (see Eqs. (98a) and (98b)) were
iteratively solved involving the post processing via integration
method with in house code based on the finite volume method.
Results are illustrated at Re 1⁄4 200 for various values of Richardson
numbers, Ri (0.1 (cid:3) Ri (cid:3) 10) and different areas of the solid block
(S 1⁄4 0:3 and 0.5). Results are first discussed for case 1. At Ri 1⁄4 0:1
and S 1⁄4 0:3; the weak heatline cell is found to occur near the top
portion of the left wall and central zone of the bottom wall involving
case 1 (Figures not shown). The adiabatic block plays a role to hinder
the heat flow around the bottom portion of the cavity. Consequently,
the dense heatlines emerge from the left wall, travel around the
upper portion and end at the right wall. As S increases to 0.5, the
weak heatline circulation cell is continued to be seen near the bot-
tom wall and the heatline trajectories are confined above the adia-
batic block or around the top portion of the cavity for case 1 (Figures
not shown). The larger size of the adiabatic block hinders the heat
transport within fluid at the bottom portion. At the higher Ri, the
two weak heatline cells occur at the left and right sides of the adia-
batic block for S 1⁄4 0:3; the heatline trajectories are pushed up and
compressed largely near the side walls. The hindrance of the heat
flow to fluid around the bottom portion is quite prominent involving
higher values of Ri (Figures not shown). Results are next discussed
for case 2. The downward lid motion of the left wall forces heat to
flow downward. Consequently, case 2 offers significant heat flow
below the adiabatic block while heat will continue to flow around
the top portion due to differential heating effect. Thus, the heatline
circulation cells develop around the adiabatic block. At the higher Ri
(Ri (cid:2) 1), another local heat circulation cells also develop along the
left wall for both S 1⁄4 0:3 and 0.5. Overall, the heatline trajectories
demonstrate that the top portion involves dense heatline trajecto-
ries via conduction whereas the bottom portion involves thermal
mixing effect via the heatline circulation cells (Figures not shown).
The heatline characteristics of case 3 at Ri 1⁄4 0:1 demonstrate that
clockwise rotating heatline cells occur near the left wall for both S 1⁄4
0:3 and 0.5 (Figures not shown). As Ri increases to 10, another clock-
wise heatline circulation cell appears near the right wall for S 1⁄4 0:3.
Similar to case 1, case 3 corresponds to the end-to-end heatlines
near the top portion whereas the bottom portion corresponds to hin-
drance of the heat flow, which is prominent for S 1⁄4 0:5 (Figures not
shown). The heatline studies clearly demonstrate that the heat
transfer rate improves with the insertion of an adiabatic square
block at the center of the square enclosure for the higher Ri
(Ri 1⁄4 10) and the motion of lids leads to the heat transfer enhance-
ment with the adiabatic block especially for case 2. The combination
of lid motion for case 1 or 3 with the proper size of the adiabatic
block can lead to high heat transfer rates at the top portion with the
desirable heat barrier effect along the bottom portion.

4.5. Convection for miscellaneous applications: partially open or
ventilated cavities and channels

PA number of heatline studies were carried out in the partially
open or ventilated cavity during natural convection [132(cid:1)135] as
well as mixed convection [48,127,128,136(cid:1)142]. A few heatline
studies are also found in the literature based on the forced convec-
tion [33,34,143,144]. A number of studies considered ventilation
ports near the lower and upper corners of the side walls or along the
middle portion of the top wall [48,127,128,132,133,136(cid:1)142]. A few

Pstudies also considered flow through parallel plates [143,144] and
convection within an open square cavity [134,135]. Numerical stud-
ies were carried out for various parameters such as Grashof number
(Gr), Reynolds number (Re), Lewis number (Le) and buoyancy ratio
(Bu). A few interesting features on the role of the heatlines for mixed
convection involving the open cavity with various inlet and outlet
positions are briefly explained as follows (Figures are omitted for
the brevity). The role of the inlet flow at the bottom corner of the
right wall with the varying position of the outlet either at the corner
or center of the top wall within a square cavity was investigated
[136]. The heater is located at the bottom left corner. The dense
heatlines are found to emanate from the heater exhibiting the heat
flow trajectories. At the higher values of Gr, patterns of multiple
heatline circulation cells occur for various locations of the outlet
[136]. The effect of the inlet and outlet in the presence of the heater
at the center of the left wall was also investigated [138]. The inlet of
flow corresponds to the bottom of the right wall and the outlet is sit-
uated at the center of the top wall. As expected, the heatlines are
found to emanate from the heater at the left wall. The heatlines are
concentrated near the left wall and upto the center of the top wall at
the low value of buoyancy ratio, Bu. The multiple heat flow circula-
tion cells occur throughout the cavity at Re 1⁄4 100; Gr 1⁄4 104 and
Bu 1⁄4 1 [138]. Similar analysis was extended for various locations of
the outlet at the top wall [139,140]. The heatline trajectories are
found to be sensitive of the outlet position and they follow the com-
plex path based on the outlet. The heatline trajectories were also
analyzed in the presence of the turbulent flow involving the inlet
and outlet (at the left wall) at the top and bottom portions, respec-
tively [127]. The right wall is maintained at spatially varying heat
flux and the heatlines are emanated from the right wall to left wall.
An outline of the governing equations of the heatfunction for the tur-
bulent flow is given in Section 2.8 (see Eqs. (101a) and (101b)). The
heatlines can be confined at the top portion and various heatline cir-
culation cells with complex heatline trajectories can also be found.
The turbulence model was also applied for another set of locations
of inlet and outlet flow [128]. The heatlines in the open cavity are
found to be very effective in order to visualize the energy paths con-
necting the entry and exit points. In addition, the heatline trajecto-
ries within the ventilated cavity clearly depict various patterns of
the thermal mixing within the enclosure based on different locations
of inflow and outflow.

4.6. Sensitivity of the heatfunction boundary conditions

PEarlier sections clearly demonstrate the heat flow visualization
and heat distribution based on the heatlines for various test cases.
The heatlines are pictorial representations of the heatfunctions
which are mathematically obtained via solving Poisson type differ-
ential equations (Eq. (59)) with various boundary conditions. As dis-
cussed earlier, the heatfunction boundary conditions are either
Dirichlet or Neumann type. In general, a homogeneous Dirichlet con-
dition, H 1⁄4 0 can be set as a datum or reference condition at any
point in the domain and other boundary conditions can be subse-
quently derived. Although the implementation of the heatfunction
boundary conditions based on any arbitrary location of H 1⁄4 0 can
vary, the heatline trajectories to visualize the convective heat flow
with the proper understanding of the direction and intensity of the
heat flow is invariant. In this context, Biswal and Basak [46] carried
out a comprehensive analysis on the role of various possible heat-
function boundary conditions involving natural convection within
enclosures with various shapes filled with different fluids for a set of
thermal boundary conditions (see Fig. 6 and Section 2.9). Various
possible Dirichlet boundary conditions for the heatfunction in terms
of the average Nusselt numbers are derived and examined for all the
cases (see Table 3). Results for heatlines involving the convection
dominant heat transfer within the convex walled cavity at Pr 1⁄4 7:2

Pgenerally considered at the adiabatic wall of the cavity or any conve-
nient point (origin or cold-cold junction) as mentioned in Section 2.9.
Overall, case studies as carried out by Biswal and Basak [46] con-
clude that, the heat flow patterns remain the same in the cavity irre-
spective of the choice of the heatfunction boundary conditions
based on the selection of the location of H 1⁄4 0. Thus, the heatline
concept is found to be robust for the heat flow visualization irrespec-
tive of the reference of the heatfunction (H 1⁄4 0) involving any type
of thermal boundary conditions with simple and complicated
domains.

5. Comments on the discrepancy of heatlines

PThe heatlines specifically represent the heat flow from a hot zone
to a cold zone in a particular system. As seen in most of the works,
the heatlines emanating from the hot surface and ending on the cold
surface are orthogonal to isothermal surfaces. As the heatlines
approach the top adiabatic wall, they slowly bend and become paral-
lel to that surface. The correct heatline features can only be obtained
via implementation of the correct heatfunction boundary conditions
across the walls and the hot-cold junctions. As mentioned earlier,
although the governing equation for the both streamfunction and
heatfunction is Poisson type, the non-homogeneous boundary con-
ditions prevail for the heatfunction. The discrepancy in the heatlines
implies that the heat flows from the cold wall to the hot wall or hot
wall to any adiabatic wall or hot wall to the same/different hot wall.
These discrepancies on the heatline trajectories were observed in a
few earlier works [145(cid:1)149] and hence, those works are not eluci-
dated in details.

6. Comprehensive outlook on ‘Heatlines’: foundation, impact
and perspectives

6.1. Foundation

PVarious hot and cold spots, thermal mixing zone or zone with the
high heat transfer rate is the consequence of thermal processing.
The distributions of isotherms are not adequate to address several
questions on energy transport and thermal management: How can
we identify zones with conduction or convection heat transfer domi-
nance? How is the path of the heat flow from single or multiple heat-
ers to multiple cold zones? Is it possible to enhance thermal mixing
based on some control parameters? Consequently, the path or tra-
jectories of the heat flow or ‘heatlines’ has been developed and
explored for various problems with industrial applications. The term
‘heatline’ was first introduced in 1983 [28]. Several works on the
heatlines were carried out for the visualization of the heat flow for
the boundary layer problems involving natural, forced and mixed
convection heat transfer.

PThe heatfunction is the mathematical representation of the heat-
line. Alternatively, each heatline corresponds to the constant value
of the heatfunction. The evaluation of the heatfunction can be
obtained via solving a set of first order partial differential equations
analytically or numerically for the boundary layer problem. On the
other hand, the evaluation of the heatfunction during convection
within enclosures requires the solution of the Poisson equation and
the solution strongly depends on the non-homogeneous Dirichlet or
Neumann conditions with proper signs (+ or -). In addition, the solu-
tion for the heatfunction depends on the reference of the heatfunc-
tion (H 1⁄4 0) which can be assigned at the adiabatic wall. However,
the location of the reference of the heatfunction is not straightfor-
ward for the situations with no adiabatic walls. This review is a first
attempt to present an unified approach to evaluate the boundary
conditions of the heatfunction involving a generalized approach
where the Dirichlet type heatfunction boundary conditions are rep-
resented in terms of the average Nusselt numbers with proper signs

Fig. 19. Isotherms (u) and heatlines (H) for different thermal boundary conditions
(cases 1-3) involving various locations of reference points of H 1⁄4 0 (refer Fig. 6) for
fluid involving Pr 1⁄4 7:2 at Ra 1⁄4 105 [46] (Reprinted with permission from Elsevier).

Pand Ra 1⁄4 105 are presented in Fig. 19(a)(cid:1)(c). A large closed loop
heatline cells are found at the core of the cavity for cases 1a and 1b
depicting the high thermal mixing (Fig. 19(a)). The qualitative fea-
tures of closed loop heatline cells are similar for cases 1a and 1b. The
heatline cells correspond to the negative sign similar to the stream-
line cells (Figures not shown) in both the cases (Fig. 19(a)). The heat-
line cells in cases 1a and 1b illustrate the invariance of direction of
convective heat flow with the imposition of H 1⁄4 0 involving the dif-
ferential heating. The dense heatlines are seen along the major por-
tions of side walls except at the top portion of the left and bottom
portions of the right wall. Similarly, irrespective of the imposition of
the heatfunction boundary conditions, the distributions of the heat-
lines within the interior region and along the walls are similar as
seen from the heatline contours for cases 2 (2a-2c) and 3 (3a-3c)
[see Fig. 19(b) and (c)]. The reference of the heatfunction (H 1⁄4 0) is

P(+ or (cid:1)) for various enclosures with straight or curved walls involv-
ing assemblies of thermal and velocity boundary conditions. Finally,
the heatfunctions in enclosures are evaluated based on the numeri-
cal solution (finite difference, finite volume and finite element meth-
ods).

PThe heatfunctions are pictorially denoted by ‘heatline trajecto-
ries’ and the prime applications of the heatlines revolve around to
visualize the detailed path of the heat flow towards ‘thermal man-
agement’ and ‘thermal mixing’. The role, impact and perspectives of
the heatlines associated with various heat flow visualization features
leading to guidelines for thermal management involving the bound-
ary layer problems and convection in enclosures are elucidated
below.

6.2.

‘Heatlines’ for boundary layer problems

P(cid:4) The boundary layer flow has been studied during forced or natu-
ral convection involving fluid or porous media over the horizon-
tal flat plate for two cases: (i) the cold fluid and hot wall and (ii)
the hot fluid and cold wall. The heatline trajectories depict that
the parallel heatlines emanate from the entire hot wall for (i). In
short, the entire hot wall participates to supply heat to the cold
fluid. On the other hand, the dense heatlines are found to occur
at the upstream point for (ii). This signifies that the significant
heat transport occurs from the hot fluid to the cold wall near the
entry point. In addition, the heatlines are disperse far from the
entry point for (ii). Thus, a small zone near the upstream point
of the cold wall would involve significant heat transport rate as
depicted by the dense heatline trajectories. The heatline trajec-
tories significantly vary for different fluid (Pr 1⁄4 7; 0:72; and
0,02) involving various thermal processing applications.

P(cid:4) The case studies for the heatline trajectories also involve natural
convection with the vertical wall for (i) the cold fluid and hot
vertical wall and (ii) the hot fluid and cold vertical wall. The
heatline trajectories depict the parallel heatlines for (i). How-
ever, the bottom portion of the hot wall involves enhanced heat
transport rate to fluid. The heatlines clearly depict that the mas-
sive heat transport to the cold fluid is confined near the hot wall
(i). The zone of the cold fluid far from the hot wall would not
receive significant heat. In contrast, the hot fluid would deliver
heat to the entire portion of the cold wall (ii). The bottom por-
tion of the cold wall receives larger heat than the top portion.
Interestingly, the horizontal and vertical walls definitely have
opposite characteristics either to heat fluid or extract heat from
fluid. The analysis of the heatline trajectories involving the hori-
zontal or vertical wall directs the application of horizontal or
vertical wall for specific thermal processes with the objective of
either targeted or global transfer of heat. A few applications on
the heatline visualization with the hot vertical wall involve mag-
netohydrodynamics and couple stress fluid flowing over a verti-
cal cylinder.

P(cid:4) The heatline trajectories have been demonstrated within the
boundary layer during the flow within horizontal parallel plates.
Similar to the flow over the horizontal plate, the density of the
parallel heatline decreases along the hot wall whereas the heat-
lines are slightly dense at the entry for the cold wall.

P(cid:4) The heatlines are visualized for mixed convection flow within
vertical channels filled with fluid or fluid saturated porous or
partially filled porous medium. The heatlines demonstrate that
the convective flow does not disturb the parallel heatline trajec-
tories at the low Peclet number (Pe). At the high Peclet number
(Pe (cid:2) 1), the heatline trajectories are strongly dependent on the
fluid or porous or partially filled porous medium. Consequently,
Darcy number (Da) and thermal conductivity ratio (Rk) largely
influence the heatline patterns for the system involving fluid-
porous media. The heatline trajectories can be triggered by

Psuitable control parameters such as Pe or Da or Rk to achieve the
enhanced heat flow in the porous body attached with the fluid
medium. This analysis may be useful for understanding the
enhanced thermal processing rate in practical situations involv-
ing oil saturated soil (porous) materials during extraction pro-
cess.

‘Heatlines’ for natural convection in enclosures in the presence of

6.3.
various hot wall(s)

P6.3.1. Type 1: enclosures with hot wall, cold wall and adiabatic wall(s)-
differential or Rayleigh(cid:1)B(cid:1)enard heating

P(cid:4) Natural convection within cavities filled with fluid or porous
media involving two parallel horizontal adiabatic walls in the
presence of hot and cold side walls is studied. The heatline tra-
jectories depict that conductive heat transport is dominant
within a zone near the side walls. The end-to-end heatlines
depict the smaller path of heat flow, they are parallel and occupy
the entire cavity at the low Rayleigh number (Ra). In contrast, at
the high Ra, the heat circulation cells are evolved at the core
and the end-to-end heatlines emerging from the hot wall take
the longer path to deliver heat to the cooler zone. The core
would gain heat from the heatline trajectories and that heat will
follow the path of the fluid circulation cells which grow bigger
at the high Ra and Pr. Consequently, the large heatline cell at the
core is maintained at uniform temperature, termed as ‘thermal
mixing’ zone and finally, the end-to-end heatlines are confined
near a narrow zone along some zones of the side walls leading
to the large heat transfer rate.

P(cid:4) The heatline trajectories adequately explain the effect of nano-
fluid on the heat transfer rates within cavities. The heatlines
clearly depict that the conduction dominance near the walls pre-
vails for larger volume faction of nanoparticle. The trajectories
dictate that the intensity of the heatline cells leading to thermal
mixing can be enhanced in the presence of nanofluid. Conse-
quently, the heat transfer rates at few locations of side walls can
be enhanced as indicated via the dense heatlines.

P(cid:4) The two parallel inclined walls are maintained hot and cold for
natural convection within titled cavities filled with fluid, porous
on nanofluid media. The heatline trajectories are the strong
functions of the tilt angle. The intensity and size of the convec-
tive circulation cell can be enhanced for various tilt positions.
The heatlines are the key for the thermal management to main-
tain uniform temperature or thermal mixing via identifying the
control parameters such as tilt angles or nanofluid volume fac-
tions (’) at various Ra and Pr.

P(cid:4) Convection can occur in the presence of two horizontal adiabatic
walls and the hot and cold side walls in parallellogrammic and
rhombic cavities The aspect ratio (A) and inclination angle of the
side wall for the parallellogrammic enclosure are two major
control parameters for the evolution of single or multiple heat
circulation cells. The dense heatline trajectories along various
zones can evolve with specific values of the aspect ratio of paral-
lellogrammic enclosure. The buoyancy ratio (Bu) plays as an
important parameter for the heat flow visualization of during
double-diffusive convection in parallellogrammic enclosure. The
occurrence of the heatline circulation cells along left or right
walls and the role of these cells on the complex heat flow path
depicted by the heatline trajectories are thermal management
issues during global heat and mass flow trajectories. The multi-
ple heatline cells, cell size and complex end-to-end heatline tra-
jectories can also be tuned via various inclination angles of
rhombic cavities for various fluid (Pr) at the high Ra.

P(cid:4) The horizontal walls are maintained adiabatic with the hot and
cold side walls during convection in trapezoidal cavities. The
evolution of the heatline cells involving the size, intensity and
location can be controlled via various inclination angles at the
high Ra. The inclination angle of the side wall can be one of the
control parameters to develop the thermal mixing patterns via
the heatline cells for thermal processing of various fluids. It is
B
found that, the inclination angle, ’ 1⁄4 60
is optimal for molten
B
metals (Pr 1⁄4 0:015) whereas square cavity (’ 1⁄4 90
) can be
safely used for processing of salt water. A complex situation
involving tilted trapezoidal cavities with similar thermal bound-
ary conditions is considered for the analysis of convection
involving porous medium, nanofluid and non-Newtonian fluid.
This analysis detects the evolution of various patterns and
growth of heatline cells which are controlled by the inclination
or tilt angle or porous layer thickness. Consequently, the com-
plex pattern of heatlines is found to be useful to explain heating
characteristics in thermal processing applications.

P(cid:4) The parallel horizontal adiabatic walls involving hot and cold
curved side (concave or convex) walls are also considered for
convection. The concavity or convexity of the walls are found to
be important for the evolution of single or multiple heat circula-
tion cells for thermal treatment of various fluids. The sharp con-
cavity of walls can lead to the end-to-end heatlines even at the
high Ra for specific material processing applications. On the
other hand, the enhanced intensity with multiple circulation
cells can be achieved for cavities involving convex side walls.
The curvature of the side walls can be suitably tuned to alter the
heatline trajectories for efficient thermal management during
material processing.

P(cid:4) The bottom wall is maintained adiabatic while the left and
right walls are maintained hot or cold for natural convection
within right angled triangular cavities. The unequal lengths
of the left and right walls in the triangular cavity play an
important role for the evolution of the heatline trajectories.
The growth and intensity of the heat circulation cells and
thermal mixing at various locations can be controlled via
thermal boundary conditions along the left and right walls.
This concept of convection in triangular cavity is further
extended via modifying the right wall with concave or con-
vex surface. The curved surface is maintained hot. The multi-
ple local convection heat circulation cells or a large global
heat circulation cell can be suitably tuned with various
degrees of concavity or convexity.

P(cid:4) Convection within two parallel side adiabatic walls in the pres-
ence of the hot bottom and cold top walls lead to the Rayleigh
B(cid:1)enard convection cells within square cavities. The subcritical,
critical and postcritical values of Ra are important for predic-
tions of the heatline trajectories. In general, the convection cells
(single or multiple) are weak and the parallel heatline trajecto-
ries occur within the cavity for subcritical Ra. Based on various
values of postcritical Ra, thermal management involving various
zones with parallel heatline trajectories and heatline circulation
cells can be devised. The similar heating situation is applied for
thermodependent power law fluids. It is found that the rheologi-
cal properties and effect of temperature can promote or sup-
press various complex heat flow trajectories to maintain various
temperature levels during material processing. The effect of
periodic cooling of top wall is evaluated via various amplitude
ratio. The amplitude ratio is the key parameter for the manage-
ment on the evolution of various heatline circulation cells at the
top and bottom portions of the square cavity to maintain various
levels of temperature uniformity or thermal mixing for various
processing applications. The role of the bottom hot and top cold
walls with the adiabatic side walls is evaluated for the

Psolidification in the rectangular cavity. The heatline trajectories
bring out the detailed physics of heat transfer during solidifica-
tion. Finally, similar heating situation is studied in rhombic vs
square cavities. The inclination angles of the side wall control
the growth and intensity of single or multiple heatline circula-
tion cells.

P6.3.2. Type 2: enclosures with multiple hot or cold walls and one
adiabatic wall

P(cid:4) Natural convection is studied within square cavities involving
the top adiabatic wall, bottom horizontal wall and side cold
walls. The heatline trajectories exhibit symmetric heat flow
path from the bottom to side walls. In general, the top portion of
the side walls receives less heat at the low Ra. The two primary
symmetric heat circulation cells develop at the center leading to
large thermal mixing zones. The multiple heat circulation cells
are found at the low Pr. The heat circulation cells alter signifi-
cantly the end-to-end heat flow paths. The large heat circulation
cells have positive impact on the enhanced heat transfer rate at
middle and top portions of the side walls. The heating patterns
of the cavity wall can be altered via the non-uniform or sinusoi-
dal heating pattern of the bottom wall and linear heating pattern
of side walls. The heating pattern can be controlled via ‘thermal
aspect ratio’. The eye of the heatline cell can be shifted based on
various values of the thermal aspect ratio. The growth, number
and intensity of heatline cells can be tuned via various values of
thermal aspect ratio and Pr. The heatline trajectories are also
studied for convection in nanofluids within cavities with the
cold side walls, hot bottom wall and top adiabatic wall. The
heatline cells at the core can become less intense (less thermal
mixing) with the large volume fraction of nanofluids while the
heat transfer rate along the side wall is improved with the larger
volume fraction. A large portion of thermal mixing zone with
the large heat circulation cells occurs for convection of fluids
with the hot bottom and left walls involving the cold right wall.
Consequently, the large heat transfer rate is observed at the
right wall based on large number of heatline trajectories carry-
ing heat from the bottom as well as left wall.

P(cid:4) Natural convection is investigated for rhombic cavities with the
hot bottom wall, cold inclines walls and adiabatic top wall. The
heatline trajectories indicate that the enhanced heat transfer
can occur either of the inclined walls based on the inclination
angle. The evolution of single or multiple heatline circulations
occur in the rhombic cavity. The heatline trajectories elucidate
that the inclination angle and Prandtl number can control the
growth and size of the heatline cells as well as the heat transfer
rate at the side walls.

P(cid:4) One wall is maintained hot and that wall is attached with two
cold adjacent walls in the presence of one adiabatic wall during
natural convection within tilted square cavities. A few interest-
ing characteristics on various heat circulation cells occur at the
high Ra. It is found that the asymmetric heat circulation cells
can appear at the low values of tilt angles. The single large heat
circulation cells can occur at the high tilt angles (’ (cid:2) 75°). The
large heat circulation cells would lead to the high compression
of the isotherms or high heat transfer rate at the top portion of
the cold side walls. The heatlines clearly demonstrate that the
tilt angle and Prandtl number play significant role on achieving
local or global thermal mixing for various material processing
applications.

P(cid:4) The bottom wall is maintained hot alongwith the two cold side
walls during natural convection within trapezoidal cavities. The
heatline trajectories are similar to those as explained earlier for
square cavities with type 2 boundary conditions. The larger ther-
mal mixing with the large heatline circulation cells can be

Pachieved based on larger inclination angles of the side walls. The
thermal processing within trapezoidal cavities is also carried
out with the hot bottom wall in the presence of linearly heated
side wall(s) or isothermally cooled side wall. The heating pat-
terns are compared for various inclination angles from trapezoi-
dal to square cavities. The heatlines trajectories elucidate that
the trapezoidal cavities promote enhanced thermal mixing com-
pared to square cavities. The selective high heat transfer rate
can be promoted via asymmetric thermal boundary conditions
at the side walls as projected by heatline trajectories.

P(cid:4) The vertical or inclined wall can be maintained adiabatic
whereas one side wall is cold in the presence of the hot bottom
wall for natural convection within right angled triangular cavity.
The effect of the location (vertical or inclined wall) of the adia-
batic wall and the aspect ratio has been investigated for the
visualization of the heatline trajectories. The heatlines demon-
strate a series of patterns of multiple heatline cells which can be
tuned based on the aspect ratio or the location of adiabatic walls.
Various local thermal mixing zones can occur for various proc-
essing applications.

P(cid:4) Various tilt positions of the isosceles triangular cavities in the
presence of the adiabatic wall and non-isothermal heating of
side walls (identical lengths) are considered for convection.
Three tilt positions are considered where two cases involve the
horizontal adiabatic wall and other case involves the vertical
adiabatic wall. The two symmetric heatline circulation cells
occur for the cases with the horizontal adiabatic wall whereas
unicellular heat circulation cells occur for the case with the ver-
tical adiabatic wall. The wall heat transfer rates can be signifi-
cantly altered with various tilt positions. The heatlines can
forecast selective enhanced heating rates at various locations of
walls and desired thermal mixing zones at the core for various
orientation of the adiabatic wall within tilted triangular cavities.

P6.3.3. Type 3: enclosures with multiple hot or cold walls and no
adiabatic wall

P(cid:4) Natural convection within modified square enclosures with the
wavy shaped right wall is considered. The bottom wall is main-
tained hot and other walls are maintained cold. The amplitude
and number of undulations of the right wall have significant
impact on the heatline circulation cells and heat transfer rate
along the walls. The amplitude of undulations significantly influ-
ences the growth an locations of the heatline cells. As the ampli-
tude of undulation increases, the heatline cells near the right
wall gradually become more intense. The higher number of
undulations also suppress the intensity of the heatline cell. The
cold side wall with undulations in the presence of the hot bot-
tom wall with no adiabatic wall plays the major role to control
thermal mixing and wall heat transfer rates as explained via the
heatline trajectories.

P(cid:4) A few interesting features of heatlines are observed for the right
angled vertical cavity with the hot bottom wall and cold inclined
walls during convection in porous right angled triangular cavity.
The major heatline cell grows near the left wall and the growth
of the cell can be administered via various values of aspect ratio.
The lower values of the aspect ratio (A (cid:7) 0.25) lead to initiate
Rayleigh B(cid:1)enard type cells near the right wall. The multiple local
thermal mixing zones, preferential thermal mixing near the left
wall and enhanced wall heat transfer rates are the outcome of
the heat flow visualization characteristics.

P(cid:4) Type 3 boundary conditions have direct applications for heat
exchanger or heat recovery applications. The two entrapped tri-
angular cavities (bottom and top) occur between two pipes with
tilted square cross section. The fluid/porous media within the

Ptriangular cavities can be used for the heat exchange from the
fluid flowing within pipes. The triangular cavities involve cold or
hot inclined walls with hot or cold bottom and top horizontal
walls. Based on the thermal boundary conditions of the walls,
either any fluid or fluid with the high Pr can be used in bottom
or top triangular cavities for the efficient heat exchange as
depicted via heatline circulation patterns and end-to-end heat-
lines. The presence of the porous medium was found to be
important for suppressing convective heat flow whereas multi-
ple heat flow circulation cells can occur for low Pr fluids. The
heatlines demonstrate an unique application on how to entrap
or promote heat flow intensities.

‘Heatlines’ for natural convection in enclosed cavities with discrete

6.4.
heaters along the walls

P6.4.1. Heaters are attached with side walls and other portions of the
walls are maintained adiabatic and cold

P(cid:4) The presence of two heaters at the right wall is investigated with
the upper heater (heater-1) involving the sinusoidal heating and
lower heater (heater-2) involving the uniform heating for case 1
while the heating pattern (sinusoidal or uniform) is reversed for
case 2. In both the cases, the left wall is maintained cold as heat
sink. The role of frequency of the wall heating and dimensionless
time during sinusoidal heating pattern is clearly elucidated via
the heatline trajectories. Case 1 demonstrates the large heatline
circulation cell near heater-1 and the number of secondary cir-
culation cells can be tuned with the dimensionless time. On the
other hand, case 2 demonstrates bi-cellular heatline circulation
cells in the upper and central halves. Similar to case 1, a large
heatline circulation cell occurs near the right half. The influence
of time in sinusoidal heating either for heater-1 or heater-2 is
depicted via the growth and intensity of the heatline cells. This
time dependent heating pattern in specific locations of the side
wall can promote thermal mixing and heat transfer rates for
specific applications. The heatline trajectories are found to play
the crucial role for thermal management.

P(cid:4) One single heater can be placed at various locations of the right
wall during double diffusive convection within a square cavity.
Similar to previous study, the left wall is maintained isother-
mally cold. The buoyancy ratio (Bu) is found to play an impor-
tant role for the evolution of the heatline cells. Note that, the
positive value of Bu corresponds to the aiding flow (buoyancy
driven flow and shear driven flow are in the same direction)
whereas the negative value of Bu corresponds to the opposing
flow (buoyancy driven flow and shear driven flow are in oppo-
site directions). The heatline path can be drastically changed via
positive or negative values of Bu. The heatline can bend upward
and finally travel downward for the high positive values of Bu.
Similarly the heatline bends downward for the high negative
values of Bu. The concept of buoyancy ratio is found to be useful
to optimize the heat flow path and thermal mixing. The heatline
trajectories detect that the thermal mixing can be enhanced
with the central location of the heater at the right wall.

P(cid:4) The upper portion of the left wall can be maintained hot and the
upper portion of the right wall is isothermally cooled during nat-
ural convection within a square cavity. This heating setup has a
unique objective to analyze discrete diffusive (end-to-end heat-
lines) and convection (heatline circulations) zones for all the
ranges of Ra. At the lower values of Ra, the end-to-end parallel
heatlines occur near the upper portion whereas the lower por-
tion contains the convective heatline circulation cells. The circu-
lation cells can be enlarged for the higher values of Ra. A few
processing applications may involve the zones of high thermal

Pmixing as well as large heat transfer zones. Consequently, this
heating set-up with various values of Ra can thermally manage
various heat circulation patterns and zones with the end-to-end
heatlines.

P(cid:4) Various combinations of heaters and sinks can be placed along
the side walls during convection in square cavities. Three differ-
ent combinations can be considered: heat sources along the left
wall and sinks along the right wall (case 1); heat source-sink
pair at each side wall (case 2) and heat sources and sink at the
left wall (case 3). The rest of the portion is insulated. This situa-
tion has direct applications in systems involving multiple heat-
ing elements (chips) associated with sinks (fans). The heatline
trajectories are found to be the unique tool (a way of thermal
management) to deduce how the heat flow occurs from a heater
to the sinks. A heater at a particular location may not deliver
heat to the nearest sink or may deliver heat to the nearest sink
via a long trajectory associated with large heatline circulation
cells. Various combinations of source-sink combinations lead to
multiple heatline circulation cells. As mentioned earlier, the top
and central heaters can deliver heat to the sinks at the top por-
tions whereas heat from the bottom heaters follows the longer
path to reach almost all sinks. The thermal mixing zone, hotter
left zone and cooler right zone are the few outcomes which can
be explained via various heatline trajectories and heatline cells
within multiple heater-sink assemblies.

P(cid:4) Heaters can be placed as symmetric or asymmetric manner in
each side wall of the square cavity. The rest of the portion of the
side walls is maintained isothermally cold and horizontal walls
are maintained adiabatic. This set-up can be a replacement of
differential heating with the hot left wall and cold right wall as
the length of two discrete heaters is identical to the length of
the hot left wall. During differential heating, the thermal mixing
at the core is poor. The symmetric or asymmetric heaters are
found to be instrumental to enhance thermal mixing at the core
based on various patterns of heatline cells. The heatline trajecto-
ries also suggest that the heaters should not be placed near the
top portion as the heatline trajectories will not reach the bottom
portion for a global enhancement of the heating rate. The heat-
line cells and trajectories can provide guidelines or thermal
management policy on enhanced thermal processing rates with
the optimal arrangements of symmetric and asymmetric loca-
tions of heaters.

P6.4.2. Heaters are attached with bottom and side walls, top or bottom
wall is maintained adiabatic and other portions of the walls are
maintained cold with a few cases of adiabatic strips at the side or
bottom wall

P(cid:4) The heater can be placed at the center of the bottom wall in the
square cavity. A combined numerical and experimental study
with the mass flow controller is carried out for convection in the
cavity. The heatline trajectories depict that conduction is domi-
nant for the heat transport from the heater along the axial tube
wall. Convection heatline circulation cells are observed during
heat transport to or from the wall. The circular heatlines exhibit
convection heat transport from the wall to gas stream at the
upstream or from the gas stream to the wall at the downstream.
The heatline trajectories clearly play the decisive role for the
change in temperature in tube wall at the upstream or down-
stream section.

P(cid:4) A few series of discrete heaters can be arranged at the side and
bottom walls within square cavities. Initially, a central heater at
the bottom and two heaters are arranged at various locations of
side walls. Two symmetric heat circulation cells at the top por-
tion and two at the bottom occurs for the heaters located at the

Pcenter of the side walls. The asymmetric heaters at the side walls
change dramatically the pattern of the heatlines. The asymmet-
ric heaters play critical role to distribute heat at various cold
zones of the cavity leading to the large heat circulation cell. In
another study, two multiple heaters are placed at the bottom
wall and each side all such that the total heater length remains
unchanged with the length of the single heater at each wall in
the previous case. The multiple heaters promote multiple heat
circulation cells. The heatline trajectories are the key for the
thermal management to decide whether to choose two asym-
metric heaters or multiple heaters at each wall.

P(cid:4) Two discrete heaters can be placed at the bottom wall within the
square cavity. Each heater is maintained at constant heat flux.
The effect of various ratios of the length of heaters and heat flux
of heaters is investigated. In general, the heatline cells are sym-
metric if each of the ratio is 1. The ratio of the heat flux or length
of two heaters plays the crucial role to control the size of the left
or right vortex of the heatline cells and heat transfer rates at var-
ious portions of the side walls. The same heating set up is further
used in the presences of two external magnets just below the
heaters. This set up is used for the analysis of convection within
ferrofluids (Pr 1⁄4 49:6). The external magnets can be moved near
to or far from the bottom wall. The heat circulation cell is found to
be weaker for the magnets far away from the heater. In addition,
the heat circulation cells are stronger for the large dimension of
the cavity as the magnetic field weakly influences the heat circula-
tion cells. The two discrete heaters at the bottom wall with vari-
ous parameters (the ratio of heat flux or length and distance of
the external magnet) control the evolution of heat circulation cells
at various locations and heatline trajectories.

P(cid:4) Two discrete heaters can be located at the top portion of the left
wall and the left portion of the bottom wall within a square cav-
ity. The right wall can be maintained cold. Each of the heaters
can be maintained either at constant heat flux or at constant
high temperature. Various combinations of heating conditions
(constant heat flux or temperature) is demonstrated via the
heatline trajectories which depict heat transport at the cold
right wall and bottom portion of the left wall. The strength of
the heatline circulation cells and heat transfer rate at various
portions of the cold walls can be enhanced via isothermal heat
sources. A few sets involving heaters with specific combinations
of heat flux or isothermal condition demonstrate enhanced ther-
mal mixing and heat transfer rates.

P(cid:4) Two heaters (identical size) can be placed at the side walls for the
two types (type 1: normal triangle and type 2: inverted triangle)
of isosceles triangular cavities with the horizontal adiabatic wall.
The heaters can be placed at symmetric or asymmetric positions
along side walls. The heating patterns are compared with square
cavities involving two horizontal adiabatic walls with identical
heater lengths at the side walls. It may be noted that the sum of
the horizontal walls of the square cavity is identical with the hor-
izontal wall of the triangular cavity. The area of the square or tri-
angular cavity is maintained identical. Similar to square cavities,
the asymmetric locations of heaters lead to larger heat circulation
cells for triangular cavities. The heatline trajectories detect that
the triangular (type 1 or type 2) cavity can promote the thermal
mixing compared to the square cavity.

P6.4.3. Heaters are attached with bottom and left walls with multiple
cold and adiabatic strips at all the walls

P(cid:4) The heaters can be arranged at the center of the left and bottom
walls of the square cavity. The cold zone at the top wall receives
heat from both the heaters whereas the bottom heater delivers
heat to the cold zone of the right wall. Similar to previous cases,

Pthe larger thermal mixing occurs via large heatline circulation
cells at the higher Ra. A comparison with the differential heating
dictates that this set up of heaters certainly promotes thermal
mixing with the assistance of heatline trajectories tool. The dis-
crete heaters are definitely the positive outcome of the heatlines
based thermal management.

6.5.

‘Heatlines’ for conjugate convection in enclosed cavities

P6.5.1. Finite thickness at the side wall (s) and/or horizontal wall(s)

P(cid:4) The thick solid wall can occur at the left (case 1) or right (case 2)
side or at both the side walls (case 3). The thick wall(s) either at
one side wall or both the side walls can influence the heatlines
during convection within the square cavity with the cold left
wall, hot right wall in the presence of adiabatic horizontal walls.
The comparison of the heating pattern is important as the total
thickness of the thick wall(s) is identical for cases 1-3. The heat-
line cells would be less intense in the presence of the thick wall
attached with the hot side wall as the thick wall would entrap
heat and heat will not penetrate to fluid. The heatlines are paral-
lel within thick wall corresponding to one dimensional conduc-
tion heat transfer even at the high Ra. The thermal mixing at the
core associated with large heatline vortex can be suitably tuned
with the thermal conductivity ratio (Rk) and thickness of side
wall(s) at the high Ra. In order to preserve liquid materials or
molten metals at the high uniform temperature, the heatline
cells and trajectories are the route for the thermal management
via controlled thickness of the walls with the appropriate ther-
mal conductivity ratio.

P(cid:4) The thick solid wall (ceiling) can be placed at the top wall in the
presence of the hot left wall, cold right wall and adiabatic hori-
zontal walls. The parallel heatlines or one dimensional conduc-
tion heat transfer occurs within the solid wall especially for the
high thermal conductivity ratio. Similar to previous case, the
large heatline circulation cell occurs within fluid and the heat-
line vortex spans over 80% of the enclosure for the smaller thick-
ness of the wall. The solid ceiling is found to be the major factor
to control the structure of heatline cells. The idea of top ceiling
is further extended in the presence of the insulated heat barrier
at the center of solid ceiling. The heat barrier has significant role
to change structures of the heatline trajectories and heat circula-
tion cells for the high thermal conductivity ratio. In that case, the
heat barrier leads to separate hot and cold regimes within the
solid ceiling. The heatlines are found to be more dense at the
right side of the heat barrier. The heat barrier in the solid ceiling
is an interesting concept to alter heating patterns in the solid
barrier (one dimensional conduction does not occur) as well as
the thermal mixing in the fluid regime as depicted via the heat-
line trajectories.

P(cid:4) The thick solid wall can be placed at the bottom wall or at both
the horizontal walls in the presence of various heating condi-
tions of the horizontal walls within the square cavity. A study
within porous cavity with the hot bottom thick wall, top cold
wall and adiabatic vertical walls exhibits that various values of
the thermal conductivity ratio and thickness of the solid wall
can lead to various patterns of the heatline vortex to maintain
desired temperature. Thermal processing of nanofluid is also
studied in the presence of the thick bottom wall due to the sinu-
soidal heating at horizontal walls with adiabatic side walls. The
solid wall at the bottom with the higher thickness can lead to
the asymmetric heatline vortices. The role of thick horizontal
walls can be examined with the adiabatic horizontal walls, hot
left wall and cold right wall. The thermal conductivity ratio can
be varied and a global conduction dominant heat transport can

Pbe found beyond a critical value of the thermal conductivity
ratio. Obviously, the heatline circulation cells are controlled via
the presence of the thick walls with lower values of the thermal
conductivity ratio. Common to all above studies, the topography
of the thick wall and thermal conductivity ratio (Rk) are the
prime factors for the size and intensity of heatline vortex and
thermal mixing.

P(cid:4) All the walls with the finite thickness can influence the convec-
tion pattern within the square cavity with the differential heat-
ing in the presence of the adiabatic horizontal walls. The
thickness of all the walls plays an important role to control the
multiple or concentrated circular heatline cells. The heatline tra-
jectories demonstrate that thickness of the walls can be suitably
tuned to achieve conduction heat transfer zone as well as tar-
geted thermally well mixed zone.

P6.5.2. Thick fins and rectangular blocks attached with the walls

P(cid:4) Two vertical thick partitions or obstacles can be hanged from the
top and bottom walls within a differentially heated square cav-
ity with adiabatic (type I) or non-uniformly heated (type II) hori-
zontal walls. The left wall can be maintained hot (case 1) or cold
(case 2). The heating patterns of the walls (cases 1 and 2; types I
and II) play important role to determine the shapes of the heat-
line trajectories. For type I condition of the horizontal wall, case
2 promotes intense heatline cells with equal size at the core and
large heat transfer rates along the walls at the high value of ther-
mal conductivity ratio (Rk). Although type II exhibits similar
heatline trajectories at the core, the end-to-end heatlines are
found to be connected between either of the side wall and the
horizontal walls. A series of vertical fins with the high thermal
conductivity can represent ‘first construct’ based on constructal
theory [150,151] which has applications from engineering to
medical sciences. The heatlines are found to be unique tools to
devise an optimal design of first construct to achieve thermal
mixing within interior zones surrounded by heated surfaces. A
few test cases of various topography of fins to promote thermal
mixing at the interior zones follow next.

P(cid:4) A number of obstacles can be hanged from the top and bot-
tom walls within a differentially heated square cavity with
the adiabatic horizontal walls. The number of rectangular
obstacles (NA) is varied between 8-14. For NA 1⁄4 8; the heat-
line circulation cells are found at the gap between obstacles. As
NA increases to 14, the tiny heatline circulation cells occur
between the obstacles and a large number of end-to-end heat-
lines prevail. The larger value of Rk leads to the more intense
heatline cells. On the other hand, the larger numbers of solid
obstacles or partitions lead to intense conductive heatlines. In
general, a number of solid obstacles definitely lead to complex
heat flow trajectories which also result in a completely differ-
ent isotherm distributions compared to the differentially
heated cavity. The heatlines spectrum plays a decisive role on
the optimal number of obstacles with proper thermal conduc-
tivity ratio to maintain convection or conduction dominant
heating effect which is in general useful for electronic systems
and related applications.

P(cid:4) A vertical partition with the thinner upper portion and thicker
lower portion can be attached in a differentially heated square
cavity with the top and bottom adiabatic walls. Similar to previ-
ous studies, the thermal conductivity ratio, Rk can be varied. At
the higher values of Ra, the intense heatline circulations appear
in the left half whereas the multiple circulation cells appear in
the right half. The intensities of heatline cells can be tuned with
various values of Rk. The two distinct/different thermal mixing
zones at the left and right halves can be useful for simultaneous

lines can be used as a forecasting tool towards the efficient ther-
for simultaneous material processing in
mal management
a series of chambers which are separated by various vertical
partitions.

P(cid:4) Finally, the influence of varying position of an adiabatic vertical
obstacle or ceiling-mounted barrier which is hanged from the
top wall within a differentially heated square cavity with the
horizontal adiabatic walls is studied. The three positions of the
ceiling-mounted barrier are chosen at near the left wall, center
or near the right wall. The presence of the barrier at the center
leads to the segregation of heatline cells whereas the other posi-
tions lead to the large intense heatline cell. This unique study
shows that an adiabatic barrier simply can deform or break the
heatline cells leading to various thermal mixing zones and
desired values of wall heat transfer rates.

P6.5.3. Single or multiple square blocks within cavities

P(cid:4) A square conducting block can be placed at a center of the differ-
entially heated square cavity with adiabatic horizontal walls.
The thermal conductivity ratio, Rk plays an important role to
decide the trajectories of heatlines. At the low Rk, the heatline
circulation cells surround the solid block and the end-to-end
heatlines are sharply squeezed towards the top half at the high
Ra. At Rk 1⁄4 10; a number of heatlines pass through the solid
block leading to mostly end-to-end type heatlines. Another
study focuses with the central solid block involving non-uniform
sinusoidal heat fluxes at the side walls with horizontal cold
walls. Various heatline trajectories exhibit the path of the heat
flow from the right wall to the horizontal walls. The heat flow to
the middle portion of the horizontal walls can be restricted via
the larger size of the solid block. The dimension of the solid
block and Rk are the key for the thermal management to obtain
convective or conducting heatlines.

P(cid:4) The comparison of the central conducting or adiabatic solid
block is studied for convection within the square cavity with the
hot bottom wall, cold left wall and other adiabatic walls. Similar
to earlier cases, the end-to-end heatlines through the conduct-
ing block are observed for the higher values of Rk. The wall heat
transfer rate or density of the end-to-end heatlines can be
invariant for the larger size of the conducting solid block. On the
other hand, a thermally inactive zone at the center of heatline
vortex in the absence of the sold block can be identified at the
high Ra. In that case, the heatline trajectories detect a critical
size of the central adiabatic solid block which does not disturb
the heatlines. Consequently, the adiabatic block with the online
measuring device can be placed within the cavity based on the
heatline trajectories.

P(cid:4) Finally, a number of multiple conducting small square blocks
(NB 1⁄4 16 (cid:1) 49) can be placed at the center of the square enclo-
sure. It is found that multiple heatlines encompass the solid
obstacles throughout the cavity for NB 1⁄4 16. On the other hand,
the end-to-end heatlines with conductive heat transfer prevails
for NB 1⁄4 49. The heatlines demonstrate various complex paths
or trajectories surrounding or passing through the solid blocks.
The conducting solid blocks may represent the parts of elec-
tronic system assemblies and ‘heatlines’ is the unique thermal
management tool to optimize heat transfer rates or thermal
mixing within the enclosures.

6.6.

‘Heatlines’ for mixed convection within enclosed or open cavities

P(cid:4) Mixed convection in square cavities can be induced with the top
lid (insulated) moving in positive x direction while the bottom

Pwall can be isothermally/non-isothermally heated and the side
walls can be cooled or linearly heated from the bottom corners.
Multiple heatline circulation cells and thermal mixing zones can
be controlled via the motion of top lid and various thermal
boundary conditions. A tuning parameter, ‘thermal aspect ratio
(uA)’ can be defined such that uA 1⁄4 0 corresponds to the sinusoi-
dally heated bottom wall and cold side walls whereas uA 1⁄4 1
corresponds to isothermally heated bottom wall and linearly
heated side walls. Thus, uA is an unique parameter to control the
evolution of heatline cells such that uA (cid:7) 0.5 triggers large ther-
mal mixing zones with single/multiple heatline circulation cells
at the core and dense heatline cells at the side walls. In addition,
various complex paths of the heatlines can be derived based on
various values of uA at specific values of Pr, Re and Gr.

P(cid:4) The effect of the motion of various walls within square cavities
can have significant effect on the heatline trajectories and heat-
line circulation cells. A few test cases involve the motion of the
top lid or bottom lid or both the horizontal lids while the side
wall is stationary (case 1) whereas test studies with case 2
involve the motion of the left or right or both the walls. The
directions of the motion of the walls are important in the case of
both the moving walls. Common to all cases, the top wall is
maintained adiabatic, bottom wall is isothermally hot and side
walls are maintained cold. The test studies find that the various
combinations of the motion of the wall(s) can control the size of
heat circulation cells in the left or right half or unidirectional
heat circulation cells spanning the entire cavity. It is found that
the motion of horizontal wall(s) promotes multiple thermal
mixing zones based on multiple heatline circulation cells.

P(cid:4) Mixed convection can be induced with a centrally located rotat-
ing cylinder within a differentially heated square cavity. The
size and angular velocity of the cylinder play the important role
for heatline trajectories from the left to right wall. The clockwise
rotation of cylinder assists the buoyancy induced heat flow path
leading to convective heat circulations at the core. On the other
hand, the anti-clockwise motion of the cylinder hinders the heat
flow at the core. The cylinder with lower diameter promotes
intense convective heatline cells at the center. The anticlockwise
motion of cylinders with small size can lead to various patterns
of multiples heatline cells. The end-to-end heatlines can also be
found within the entire domain at the high thermal conductivity
ratio, Rk. The multiple thermal mixing zone or conduction zone
or heat barrier zone can be thermally managed based on the
heatline trajectories. The heatline trajectories forecast various
heating patterns to decide the tuning parameters such as size
and rotation type (clockwise or anti-clockwise) of the inner cyl-
inder.

P(cid:4) The presence of nanofluid within the differentially heated cavity
shows that thermal mixing at the core and wall heat transfer
rates can be controlled via the motion of the top lid.

P(cid:4) The presence of the central adiabatic block within the differen-
tially heated cavity is studied for three cases involving case 1
(the left wall moving up and right wall moving down), case 2
(the left wall moving down and right wall moving up) and case
3 (both the side walls moving up). The motion of the side walls
plays a dramatic role to alter the heatline trajectories. Common
to all cases, the top portion of the cavity above the adiabatic
block corresponds to the end-to-end heatlines whereas the
motion of the side walls detects that heatline cells or thermal
barrier zones can occur at the center or bottom portion.
Although case 2 promotes thermal mixing, case 1 or 3 hinders
the heat flow along the bottom portion. The heatline trajectories
play the unique role to decide the set-up of mixed convection
for particular applications based on the thermal processing at
the top portion while the heat flow can be hindered at the bot-
tom zone within the cavity.

P(cid:4) A few test cases are carried out with various locations of the
inlet and outlet flow of air in the presence of the heater at the
left or right wall within a square cavity. The heatline trajectories
depict that the heatlines are confined from the heater to the out-
let (mostly at the top wall). The multiple heat flow circulation
cells can be observed for various values of dimensionless num-
bers. The heatline trajectories as well as the multiple heatline
cells also derive the complex path of energy flow from inlet to
outlet. The heatlines can provide guidelines and forecast optimal
situations for efficient thermal management in open or venti-
lated cavities.

6.7. Perspectives

PIn general, both experimental or numerical visualization techni-
ques are available for fluid flow visualization. On the other hand,
infrared thermography or pyrometer or thermochromic liquid crys-
tals (TLCs) can measure temperature which is the outcome of the
heat flow. Heat or energy is invisible and the effect is realized via hot
or cold zone. The ‘invisible heat’ flow can only be visualized via the
mathematical tool, ‘heatlines’. It is the essential idea why the heat-
lines are distinct, new, and useful. It may be noted that, the heatline
direction or energy flux vector is the same as the heat flux vector
only for pure conduction whereas the heatlines follow the stream-
lines for the convection dominance. Therefore, the unique formula-
tion of ‘heatlines’ would be devised such that the heatlines can be
automatically tuned in the presence of conduction or convection or
both. The mathematical rigors of ‘heatlines’ and ‘streamlines’ are not
the same. The governing equation of the heatfunctions is developed
based on spatial temperature and velocity fields whereas the
streamfunctions are simply based on the equation of continuity
(velocity fields). The numerical implementation of the streamlines is
simple within enclosed cavities as the no slip boundary condition
with c 1⁄4 0 is applied at the walls. On the other hand, energy trans-
fer occurs across the hot or cold walls although H 1⁄4 0 is satisfied
along an adiabatic wall. However, the location of the reference, H 1⁄4
0 may be chosen at any point in the case of multiple adiabatic walls
or combination of hot-cold walls in the absence of any adiabatic
wall. Based on the location of the reference, H 1⁄4 0; various non-zero
Dirichlet and Neumann conditions along the hot/cold wall, multiple
adiabatic walls, junction between two different walls (hot or cold or
adiabatic) and moving walls for energy transfer can be projected in a
unified manner such that the evaluation of ‘heatlines’ can be done
accurately involving complex situations. Although the mathematics
of the heatline with the arbitrary locations of H 1⁄4 0 involving differ-
ent sets of non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for H
(see Table 3) would lead different numerical values of the heatfunc-
tions within domains, the physics, path of the heat flow and direc-
tions of multiple heatline circulation cells are found to be invariant
of any location of H 1⁄4 0 [46]. The accurate heatline trajectories
imply that the heat flow occurs only from the hot to cold wall. In
addition, the heat flow and fluid flow vortices are identical for the
convection dominant flow.

PThis review brings together visually the flow of heat in all its
modes: forced, natural, mixed and conjugate convection. The com-
plex path of heat flow or ‘heatlines’ between the hot and cold walls
traversing around various heatline circulation cells or vortices can
dictate subsequent strategies to control heating rates, uniform heat-
ing or thermal mixing zone, etc which are essential for thermal man-
agement. The thermal mixing, enhanced heating rates at the wall
and various thermal management policies are elucidated for convec-
tion involving various hot and cold walls, discrete heaters, solid
walls or fins or blocks, moving walls and combined inflow-outflow
streams. The role of the heatlines on thermal mixing and manage-
ment have been found to be useful to decide the specific strategies

Pfor material processing, assemblies of electronic systems etc. The
heatline visualization of convection in enclosures can be applied to
heat flow applications in ducts and combustion chambers. The heat-
line and massline (the trajectories of species transport analogous to
heatline) were found to be successful to visualize for reacting and
non-reacting flows [152,153]. Future work can explore the coupled
heatline and massline strategies for multicomponent mass transport
with isothermal/non-isothermal reactions which would be useful
for visualization of combustion processes. In addition, the heat and
species transport trajectories (‘heatlines’ and ‘masslines’) can be
explored for 3D systems. Indeed, an attempt was made to visualize
3D heat flow via the thermal streamline concept [154] and the con-
cept of the thermal streamline would be the precursor for the imple-
mentation of ‘heatlines’ in 3D flow systems. Although most of the
test cases involve the laminar flow, the heatlines can be formulated
for the turbulent flow as discussed for flow over a plate or within
cavities [29,127,128]. Future work on the heatlines may be focussed
towards visualization of energy flow associated with 3D laminar/tur-
bulent flow involving atmospheric, combustion and complex large
scale industrial reacting flow processes. In sum, the spectrum of
‘heatlines’ (trajectories, path and circulation cells) would continue
to be the efficacious numerical tool for visualization of complex con-
vective processes towards thermal management for years to come.
The approach is particularly important because of the dominant role
played today by computational techniques and software packages.
Future computational packages would require to incorporate the
visualization method detailed in this review.
