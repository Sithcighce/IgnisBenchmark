Perovskite oxides have substantial role in the sustainable energy delivery as reflected by their applicability
as oxygen-transporting membranes (OTMs), as electrode/electrolyte components in solid oxide fuel cells
(SOFCs), and as OTM-based reactors. These applications represent three major directions that enable the
membrane-based oxy-fuel combustion technology, the clean and efficient chemical to electrical energy con-
version, and the production of higher value-added chemicals from lower value raw materials. The attrac-
tiveness of perovskite oxides arises from the possibility to incorporate different A-site and B-site metal
elements into their ABO3-d lattice to form essentially A1-xA’xB1-yB’yO3-d compound which allows tailoring of
the oxygen non-stoichiometry (and thus the oxygen ionic conductivity), the oxygen reduction reaction
activity, and the electronic conductivity to fit a particular application. This paper reviews the basic aspects
and progresses in these three directions. The advantages and limitations of perovskites in each application
are highlighted and discussed as well as the pertaining aspects.

1. Introduction

PThe substantial interest on perovskite oxides over the past few
decades and even until now have stemmed from their catalytic and/
or ionic and/or mixed ionic-electronic transport properties [1-3].
Perovskite refers to the mixed oxides adopting the idealized crystal
structure formula of ABO3 (shown in Fig. 1) where the total positive
valence of A and B cations is equal to 6 (the total negative valence of
oxygen anions) as represented by A2+B4+O3 or A1+B5+O3, or A3+B3+O3.
In real world, more often than not, perovskite exists as ABO3§d
where d denotes the oxygen anion deficiency or excess depending
on the total valence amount of A-site and B-site cations. The latter
case is more rarely found in common perovskites. Different types of
elements are included in the A- and B-site of ABO3 perovskite due to
their different requirements for the ionic radius. A-site cation nor-
mally has larger size (1.10(cid:1)1.80 A
) while B-site cation has medium
size (0.62(cid:1)1.00 A
) on which the A-site cation is surrounded by 12
oxygen anions and the B-site cation is surrounded by 6 oxygen
anions [2,3]. A-site cation is normally composed of alkaline earth,
alkaline, and lanthanide ions in a twelve-fold coordination whereas
B-site is mainly composed of smaller transition metal ions in a six-
fold coordination with oxygen ions. In addition to the primitive cubic
perovskite structure, A2BB’O6 double cubic perovskites and other
multiple lattice perovskite compounds may also exist. A2BB’O6 dou-
ble perovskites, for example, have an ordered rock salt-like arrange-
ment of BO6 and B’O6 corner-shared octahedral units in the crystal
structure [4]. The A-sites are occupied by alkaline or rare earth ions
(e.g., La, Ba, and Sr) while the B-sites are filled with transition metal
ions (e.g., Mo and W). Detailed explanations on the crystal chemistry
and the criteria for multiple ion substitution in perovskite oxide are
available from the reviews of Roy and co-workers [2,5].

PThe ideal simple perovskite structure can be regarded as a cubic
close-packed structure in which the oxygen and the A-site cations
are stacked in cubic close-packed layers along the cubic [111] direc-
tion (Fig. 1 (b)). Some of the resulting octahedral holes are occupied
by B-site cations [2]. Perovskite can also be considered as ReO3-type
framework constructed from corner-sharing BO6 octahedral and
with A-site ions placed in twelve-coordinate interstices. It was found
that the existence of a stable BO3 skeletal is the most important

(cid:3)

Pprerequisite for a stable cubic perovskite phase structure [7]. From
the geometric point of view, stable octahedral coordination within
the perovskite oxides is favorable when the B-site cation radius is
more than 0.51 A
. Meanwhile, the BO3 skeletal sub-lattice can be fur-
ther stabilized by large A-site cations in octahedral coordination at
the center of eight BO6 octahedral. The presence of small or large A-
site cation may distort the BO6 skeletal sub-lattice from the ideal
cubic representation. The lowest limit for the A-site cation radius is
normally 0.9 A
. Some other crystal geometries such as orthorhombic
or rhombohedral is favored if this distortion is too large. The A and
B-site cation size limit which can be tolerated to maintain specific
structure is defined through the tolerance factor as follows:
ð
Þ
t 1⁄4 RA þ RO

ð
RB þ RO

(cid:3)

where RA, RB, and RO represents the radius of A-site cation, B-site
cation, and oxygen anion, respectively.

PIn perovskite oxides, t equal 1 represents ideal cubic structure
formation while its deviation from 1 indicates a mismatch between
the equilibrium A-O and B-O bond lengths [8]. In reality, the perov-
skite structure can exist over the relative wide tolerance range with
the value of t between 0.75 and 1. In case of the tolerance factor
smaller than 0.9 but larger than 0.75, a cooperative bulking of corner
bulking of the corner shared octahedron takes place, leading to the
orthorhombic distortion. In this case, the A-site ions are displaced
along pseudo-cubic directions or (010) directions. A small deforma-
tion from cubic to rhombohedral symmetry may take place when
there is no octahedral buckling in the crystal lattice with the toler-
ance factors, t between 0.9 and 1.0 [8]. Goldschmidt tolerance factor
provides an estimate towards the cubic structure formation. The
derivation for the Goldschmidt factor is based on the assumption of
an ideal packing where the A-site cation touches B-site cation and
vice versa. In real practice, there are additional interactions that may
cause deviation from this ideal packing such as Coulombic interac-
tion, etc. Therefore, in most cases, it is not impossible for a cubic
structure to form even when the tolerance factor is slightly larger
than 1 [9].

PIn addition to the A and B-site cation radius, the other require-
ment needs to be met for the perovskite structure is the electrical

Pneutrality, i.e., that the sum of charges of A and B-site cations must
be equal to the total charges of oxygen anions. Partial substitution of
A and B-site cations by doping with different cations with varying
ionic radius and valence is thus possible within the perovskite
framework. Due to the tolerance of the perovskite structure against
the change of its compositional ions, non-stoichiometry phenome-
non in perovskites becomes very common, arising from either cation
deficiency in the A or B-site, anion deficiency, or anion excess. In the
cation deficiency case, A-site cations can be absent without the col-
lapse of the perovskite structure due to the stability of the BO3 sub-
lattice [10]. On the contrary, B-site cation vacancies are not energeti-
cally favored considering the large structure formation change and
the small size of the B cations in perovskites.

PIn comparison to the cation-deficiencies, oxygen vacancies are
more common in perovskite structure. Oxygen vacancies are partic-
ularly important towards oxygen ionic conduction. Oxygen gas is
incorporated and released from the crystal lattice of the perovskite
material at the high and low oxygen chemical potential side. The
oxygen vacancies enable oxygen ions to be selectively transported
through the lattice via a hopping mechanism, providing there is a
gradient in oxygen chemical potential. This is feasible only when the
oxygen ions possess sufficient thermal energy to overcome the
energy barrier to hop from one lattice site to the other, which is ful-
filled at elevated temperatures [3]. The oxygen vacancy concentra-
tion can be adjusted by substituting ions of similar size but different
valence. For example, oxygen vacancies in LaBO3 oxide can be
formed as a result of partial replacement of some La3+ ions by Sr2+ in
La1-xSrxBO3-d. When the B-site cations adopt a mixed-valence state,
charge neutrality is maintained by both the formation of oxygen
vacancies and a change in the valence state of the B-site cations. The
oxides might show high oxygen ion conductivity due to the high
oxygen vacancy concentration as well as high electronic conductiv-
ity due to the mixed-valence state [11]. The concentration of oxygen
vacancies can also be increased by B-site cation substitution using
divalent metal, such as Cu and Ni. If the valence state of the B-site
cations is fixed, electrical neutrality is maintained only by the forma-
tion of oxygen vacancies. In this case, the perovskite oxides may pre-
dominantly show ionic conductivity. It is worth noting that the
concentration of oxygen vacancies may not always be proportional
to the oxygen ionic conductivity especially since large concentration
of oxygen vacancies may lead to the formation of oxygen vacancies
ordering [12].

PThe electronic conduction in perovskite structure is realized via
B-site (transition metal) lattice ions through overlapping B-O-B
bonds via a mechanism known as the Zerner double exchange pro-
cess as shown below:
Bnþ (cid:1)O2(cid:1)(cid:1)B

ð2Þ
PThis process is facilitated by strong overlap between the B site ion
and O2- orbital which is maximized for B-O-B angles at 180°, i.e.,
cubic structure. In the orthorhombic structure, the tilting of BO6
octahedral leads to a decrease in the B-O-B overlap which provides a
larger barrier to the electronic conduction along the perovskite crys-
tal lattice. In accordance to the above double exchange mechanism,
electronic conduction requires the presence of B-site cations with
multiple valences. The electronic conduction can be of n-type or p-
type, depending on the material properties and the ambient oxygen
partial pressure. The Fermi energy level shifts from the center of the
energy gap toward the empty zone for an n-type semiconductor or
the filled band for a p-type semiconductor [13]. An n-type conductor
is an electron conductor while a p-type conductor is an electron hole
conductor. The n-type electronic conductors are generally not stable
at high temperatures in air or other oxidizing atmospheres since an
oxygen deficiency is required to generate electrons. However, p-
type electronic conductors are typically stable in air because an
excess of oxygen is required to generate holes [14]. As such,

Pperovskite-type oxides with p-type electronic conductivity are
generally inactive for methane partial oxidation while those with
n-type electronic conductivity, dominant ionic conductivity, and
negligible conductivity are active for this reaction [15].

PTo this end, the desired ionic transport properties, ionic and/or
electronic conductivity, oxygen reduction reactivity, and mechanical
and/or structural stability can be obtained by combining different
metal oxides into the crystal lattices. Theoretically, if the mixed
ionic-electronic conducting properties are desired, oxygen vacancies
and electron conduction can be promoted by incorporating metal
cation with low valence in A-site so that the total valence of cation is
much less than 6 and incorporating transition metal elements into
the B-site, respectively [3]. Vice versa, if only oxygen ionic conductor
is required, non-transition metal can be chosen, such as Ga; LaGaO3,
for example, has been reported as an excellent oxygen ionic conduc-
tor [16]. The resultant performance is determined by the combina-
these properties depending on the specific
tion of some of
application considered. For example, high ionic and electronic con-
ductivities and structural stability are very crucial for oxygen trans-
porting membrane (OTM) and OTM-based reactor applications
while high oxygen reduction reactivity is imperative for cathode
application in solid oxide fuel cells.

PThis review deals with the perovskite applications into three
important areas: oxygen separation membranes, solid oxide fuel
cells, and membrane reactors, all of which are performed at elevated
temperatures (>500 °C) due to the need for the oxygen vacancies
which can only be formed in substantial amount at these tempera-
tures. These applications are considered very crucial due to their
role towards less emission and higher efficiency energy production
processes. In the oxygen separation membranes case, for example,
mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite can be used as
ionic transport membrane for oxygen production, which is more
competitive in terms of energy and capital consumption relative to
the conventional cryogenic distillation [3]. Given its mixed ionic-
electronic conductivity and oxygen reduction reaction activity,
perovskite can also be utilized as a cathode in solid oxide fuel cells
to create larger reaction area relative to the conventional ionic con-
ductor cathode or as an electrolyte, or as an anode [17]. Perovskite
oxides especially the ones that contain transition metal cations in
their B-site exhibit mixed ionic-electronic conductivity and thus,
high oxygen reduction activity. These properties enable the creation
of larger triple phase boundaries, i.e., the interfaces between oxygen
ion, oxygen gas, and electron, where the oxygen reduction reaction
occurs with respect to the pure ionic conductor or pure electronic
conductor [18]. As membrane within membrane reactor, perovskite
allows both separation and catalytic processes to be achieved in sin-
gle step [19]. The applications of perovskite by no means are limited
to only these topics. Readers interested in other applications can
find out more details in the excellent review made by Peena and
Fierro [1].

2. Perovskite membranes for oxygen separation

POxygen is considered as one of the most frequently used gas in
modern industrial process. In spite of its abundance in earth's atmo-
sphere, pure oxygen is expensive and difficult to be produced in
massive scale; often requiring energy intensive steps. Therefore,
numerous processes have used atmospheric air as their main source
of pure oxygen. In this case, other gases are also produced and com-
bined into a mixture which should be handled properly after pro-
cess. Considerable efforts have recently been paid towards the study
and design of solid oxide materials with the ability to conduct oxy-
gen ions in their crystal lattice. Perovskite materials which can con-
duct electrons in addition to oxygen ions, the so-called mixed
(oxygen) ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs), have gained great
interest as OTM material. When these MIECs are used as membranes

Psubjected to two different atmospheres of distinct oxygen potential,
they can transport the oxygen across the potential gradient. The
implementation of perovskite-based oxygen separation membrane
technology offers advantages for integration in power generation
cycles with carbon dioxide (CO2) capture by oxy-fuel combustion
[20].

2.1. Oxygen permeation

POxygen permeation process through a MIEC membrane includes
the following steps in series (Fig. 2): (1) oxygen molecular diffusion
from the gas stream to the membrane surface; (2) reaction between
molecular oxygen and oxygen vacancy on the membrane surface;
(3) bulk diffusion of oxygen ion (or vacancy) across the membrane;
(4) reaction between lattice oxygen and electron-hole on the mem-
brane surface; and (5) mass transfer of oxygen from the membrane
surface to the gas stream. In general, the resistances between the
gas phase and the membrane (steps 1 and 5) are much smaller than
the other steps and thus may be considered negligible [21].

PFor a relatively thick membrane, the bulk diffusion is generally
the rate-limiting step. In this case, the Wagner equation is usually
used to describe the permeation flux [23]:

Pelectrolyte is extrapolated to zero thickness. The Wagner theory has
been extended to treat the experimental situation where the oxygen
vacancies concentration in the membrane varies significantly from
one side to the other because of the difference in oxygen partial
pressure [24]. In this case, the flux can be written as:

where DV is the vacancy diffusion coefficient, Vm is the molar

is proportional to the oxygen partial pressure:

In most studies, it is generally assumed that the interfacial processes
are infinitely fast. This assumption is useful to simplify the physical
model and its mathematical formulation. However, sometimes it
may also be fundamentally misleading. Electrode kinetics and inter-
facial mass transfer, in fact, contribute significantly to the total
impedance of many all-solid-state electrochemical systems. For
instance, the total resistance of a cell would vanish as the thickness
of electrolyte approaches zero if the resistance to the processes at
the interface is indeed negligible. Experimental observations, how-
ever, indicate that the impedance of a solid-state electrochemical
cell approaches a finite value, as the interfacial resistance of

2.2. Progress in perovskite-type oxygen permeation membrane

PSince Teraoka et al. first reported the high electrical conductivity
and oxygen permeability of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-d series MIEC perov-
skite oxides, these materials have attracted intensive interests from
the global researchers [26]. Further work proceeded to substitute A
and B site ions in La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-d mixed conducting oxide [27];
reporting that the sequence of oxygen permeation performance is
improved in the order of Na < Sr < Ca < Ba (with Sr in A site replaced
by Na, Ca, and Ba) and La < Pr < Nd < Sm < Gd (with La in A site
substituted by Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd). It was also shown that the intro-
duction of Cu and Ni into the B-site increases the oxygen vacancy
content of the perovskite materials, thereby improving the oxygen
permeation ability. Fe, Cr, and Mn doping into B-site, on the other
hand, has negative effect on the oxygen permeation flux. This result
implies that the partial substitution of A and B-site cation can signifi-
cantly influence the oxygen permeation performance due to their
composition and phase structure change.

PThe A and B-site ion substitution of AxA’1-xByB’1-yO3-d (A, A’ = La,
Ba, Sr, Ca, etc.; B, B’ = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.) has been applied to
develop the mixed conducting perovskite materials [28]. Along with
further studies, it is gradually accepted that except for high oxygen

Ppermeation flux, the stability of the membrane materials is another
priority for practical applications. Perovskite type SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d
showed excellent oxygen permeability [29-31], the fluxes of which
reached 2.82 mL cm¡2 min¡1 at 850 °C under the air/helium atmos-
pheres [27]. Unfortunately, the cubic structure of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d
oxide can be maintained only at high temperatures (>790 °C) and
under high oxygen partial pressure (above 0.1 atm). Lowering the
operation temperature down to 790 °C induces the phase transfor-
mation due to the formation of mixed region of oxygen vacancy dis-
ordering and oxygen vacancy ordering. Moreover, the limited
stability of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d used for membrane reactors was also
reported. Pei et al. [30] investigated the long term stability of SrCo0.8-
Fe0.2O3-d membrane in the tubular membrane reactor. They found
that there were two possible reasons which might cause the mem-
brane stability degradation and membrane cracking, i.e., the surface
tension force from the gradient difference across the two sides of
the membrane and the thermal expansion coefficient disparity due
to the material decomposition of the membrane with one side
exposed to the reducing atmosphere.

PBy partially substituting other metal ions into SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d
membrane, the material stability could be effectively enhanced.
The doping effect of La3+ on the phase structure of La1-xSrxCo0.8-
Fe0.2O3-d membrane was studied by Prado et al. [32]. They found
that the material could maintain stable perovskite structure
(cid:1)5 atm) with the La3+
under pure nitrogen atmosphere (PO2
doping amount at 0.4 mol fraction. Furthermore, Shao et al. [33]
developed mixed conducting Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d (BSCF) perov-
skite oxide with excellent oxygen permeability and structure sta-
bility by utilizing Ba2+ to partially replace Sr2+ in the A-site. It was
shown that the introduction of Ba2+ into A-site inhibited the oxida-
tion of B-site ions at high temperature and reducing environment,
i.e., the oxidation of low valence state Co3+ and Fe3+ into high
valence state Co4+ and Fe4+, respectively. Other strategies involve
utilizing metal ions with fixed valence state such as Ga3+, Ti4+, and
Zr4+ to substitute cobalt ions at B-site to improve material stability
at the extreme operating conditions. Tong et al. [34] developed
perovskite type BaZr0.2Co0.4Fe0.4O3-d which showed the stable oxy-
gen permeation fluxes under the long term test of 2200 hours at
850 °C; implying that the combination between tetravalent metal
ions and oxygen ions might increase the material stability. How-
ever, the doping of tetravalent metal ions such as Ti4+ and Zr4+ into
B-site could also result in the decrease of the oxygen permeation
performance. Kharton et al. [35] ascribed this decrease to the cou-
lombic force between B-site ions and oxygen ions which also
explains the fact that A3+B3+O3 has the better ion conductivity than
A2+B4+O3.

PIt is generally thought that the perovskite mixed conducting
materials containing cobalt have higher oxygen permeability. How-
ever, the existence of cobalt in perovskite oxides also causes the
structure instability at high temperatures and reducing atmos-
pheres. It was reported that BaCeO3 oxide has good phase stability
for its perovskite structure at reducing atmospheres. Zhu et al. [36]
developed novel cobalt-free BaCe1-yFeyO3-d based on BaCeO3 oxide
by using Fe to partially substitute Ce into the B-site. The introduc-
tion of Ba2+ with large ionic radius at A-site not only decreases
the metal-oxygen bond energy and increases the crystal lattice
free volume but also bring the tolerance factor closer to 1. From
the point view of ionic radius size, the ideal structure of La(Sr)Ga
(Mg)O3 solid oxide leads to favorable oxygen ion conductivity of
0.08 S cm¡1 at 800 °C. The partial doping of transition metal ele-
ments such as Fe and Ni on the B-site of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 increased
the electronic conductivity of the materials. Mackay et al. [37] uti-
lized Mg to replace Fe in La1-xSrxGa1-yFeyO3;
leading to the
enhancement of oxygen permeation fluxes. This result suggests
that Mg doping plays an important role to decrease the bond
energy between metal ions and oxygen ions towards increasing
the oxygen vacancy concentration.

PThe oxygen permeation performances of some perovskite mem-
brane materials are listed in Table 1 [26,27,33,36,38-47]. A compre-
hensive compilation of available oxygen permeation data has been
reported by Sunarso et al. [3]. It should be taken into consideration
that the oxygen permeation tests were not always carried out under
identical conditions such as driving forces due to different oxygen
partial pressure gradients across the wall thickness, which might
have affected the permeation rate. The discrepancies in the oxygen
permeation fluxes can be correlated to the differences in the type of
membrane materials, the membrane thickness, as well as the oper-
ating conditions. Another explanation is that although the composi-
tion of two membranes may be the same, the microstructure could
be different that could significantly impact the oxygen ion transport
process. This phenomenon can be contributed to the differences in
the preparation methods and the membrane thickness associated
with the experimental conditions.

PAlthough remarkable advances to increase the oxygen flux and
stability have been made during the last decades, there are still
many remaining challenges to realize the practical application for
the perovskite mixed conducting membrane. For example, it is diffi-
cult to find single perovskite membrane material exhibiting high
oxygen permeation fluxes that satisfy the requirements for indus-
trial applications. Other challenges include the chemical and
mechanical stabilities of perovskite membranes for long-term oper-
ation at high temperatures and pressures in reducing atmospheres.

PSome strategies have been adopted to obtain perovskite membranes
with improved properties.

PIn the dual-phase membrane approach, the limited electronic
conductivity on the highly stable (yet low oxygen permeable) oxy-
gen ionic conductor phase can be addressed by adding another
electronic conductor phase [48,49]. Fig. 3 illustrates the oxygen
transport processes in the dual-phase membranes. Kharton et al.
[48] prepared a dual-phase membrane consisting of fluorite-type
ionic conducting (IC) oxide (i.e., Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-d (GDC)) for oxygen
ionic transport and perovskite-type electronic conducting (EC) oxide
(i.e., La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-d (LSM)) for electronic transport (Fig. 3(a)). The
oxygen surface-exchange reaction is generally anticipated to be lim-
ited at the triple phase boundary (TPB) [18]. Therefore, the oxygen
permeation performance can be improved by replacing the pure EC
oxide with a perovskite-type MIEC oxide (e.g., La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.2Co0.8O3-d
(LSCF)) for both oxygen ionic and electronic transport (Fig. 3(b)) [50-
52]. The introduction of ionic transport to the EC phase extends the
oxygen surface-exchange reaction beyond the TPBs and ideally over
much of the MIEC surface [18]. For example, a dual-phase membrane
comprising of fluorite-type IC oxide Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-d and perovskite-

Ptype MIEC oxide La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.2Co0.8O3-d (LSCF) was investigated by
Joo et al. [51]. At 850 °C, the oxygen flux of a 30 mm-thick membrane
was still considered low at 8.0 £ 10¡3 mL cm¡2 min¡1 under an air/
He gradient. Fang et al. [53] prepared a dual-phase membrane, using
a predominantly ionic conducting fluorite-type MIEC oxide (i.e.,
Ce0.85Gd0.1Cu0.02O2-d (CGCO)) and a predominantly electronic con-
ducting perovskite-type MIEC oxide (i.e., La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-d (LCF))
(Fig. 3(c)). This strategy leads to simultaneous oxygen ionic and elec-
tronic transport in both MIEC phases; extending the oxygen surface-
exchange reaction to the overall dual-phase membrane surface and
increasing the surface-exchange reaction rate and bulk diffusion
for oxygen permeation. A maximum oxygen permeation flux of
0.70 mL cm¡2 min¡1 was obtained with a 0.5 mm-thick membrane
at 950 °C using pure CO2 as the sweep gas. Moreover, the membrane
possessed excellent stability in the presence of CO2 even at lower
temperatures (800 °C) during long-term operation.

PMost of the related research works focus on the traditional disk
shape membranes since they are easy to prepare by the conventional
static-pressing method. However, these disk membranes only offer
very limited membrane area and brings many problems associated

Pwith flat designs such as sealing, connection, and pressure resistance
when they are applied into a multiple planar stack. Thin tubes and
hollow fibers are promising alternatives, since these geometries
lead to separation modules with larger membrane area per unit
volume [54-56]. Remarkable oxygen permeation flux higher than
10 mL cm¡2 min¡1 has been achieved on the hollow fiber perovskite
membranes [57,58]. Nonetheless, these membranes might not be
economical for long-term permeation purpose in the industry due to
the decaying performance over time. Other strategy has also focused
on using very stable materials and thin film engineering to achieve
very high fluxes to obtain high and stable oxygen fluxes [59].

2.3. Perovskite membranes integration in oxy-fuel combustion

PThe reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the
challenges in addressing global climate change. The so-called near-
zero-emission combustion technology can be achieved through
three different types of CO2 capture technologies, i.e., pre-combus-
tion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion (Fig. 4). The pre-
combustion is mainly applied to coal-gasification plants while the
post-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion can be applied to both
coal and gas fired plants. The post-combustion technology is also
currently the most mature process for CO2 capture [60]. For coal-
fired plants, the pre-combustion technology has the lowest cost per
(British) tonne of CO2 avoided while the post-combustion and oxy-
fuel technologies involve relatively identical costs [61]. However, for
gas-fired plants, the cost per (British) tonne of CO2 avoided for the
post-combustion capture is almost 50% lower than the other two
CCS technologies. The post-combustion is normally the least efficient
option with an energy penalty of about 8% and 6% for the coal- and
gas-fired plants, respectively [61].

PIn oxy-fuel combustion, fuel is combusted with pure oxygen
rather than air. This reduces the amount of nitrogen present in the
exhaust gas that affects the subsequent separation process. Substan-
tial reduction in NOx emissions is another advantage of this technol-
ogy [63]. At present, there are no full-scale plants using oxy-fuel
combustion in operation but only a few sub-scale commercial dem-
onstration plants are under development such as the 25 MWe
(megawatts electricity) and 250 MWe oxy-coal units proposed by CS
Energy and Vattenfall, respectively [64]. Cryogenic air separation is
the current default technology for oxy-fuel power plants. Its very
high energy consumption nonetheless reduces the total plant

Pefficiency by 8 to 12% [65]. Perovskite-based OTMs are perceived
as the best alternative to cryogenic air separation as it is able to
significantly lower the efficiency loss [66].

PFig. 5 shows the schematic diagram of an oxy-fuel combustion
power plant incorporating perovskite-structured OTMs. The atmo-
spheric air is compressed up to 10 bar and then heated into the
boiler up to 800 °C before being supplied to the membrane. The sep-
arated oxygen is carried by the sweep gas, i.e., CO2 and the resultant
CO2 and O2 gas mixture is used to oxidize the fossil fuel. The exhaust
gas mainly consists of CO2 (> 95%) after combustion and purification.
Part of the CO2 is recycled as sweep gas while the rest is compressed
for delivery and storage.

PThe perovskite membrane modules can be operated in either
three-end or four-end mode [68], as shown in Fig. 6. In the three-
end mode, there is no sweep gas and the oxygen is extracted from
the membrane module by a vacuum pump (Fig. 6(a)). In the four-
end membrane operation mode, the flue gas is recycled at high tem-
perature and used directly as sweep gas on the permeate side (Fig. 6
(b)). The four-end concept has not been realized in practice because
of several technological challenges, which include the need to
develop (1) a high temperature flue gas cleaning unit (700(cid:1)1000 °C)
to remove dust and impurities; (2) a high temperature recirculation
fan (500(cid:1)700 °C); and (3) a highly stable ceramic membrane that
can maintain high oxygen permeability in the presence of high con-
centration of CO2 and/or SO2. These problems do not apply to the
three-end mode as there is no direct contact between the membrane
and the flue gas. Moreover, conventional flue gas cleaning and recir-
culation fan materials can be used in three-end mode. The four-end
mode nonetheless offers simpler air separation unit and heat inte-
gration design.

PSufficient oxygen permeability and good stability under CO2
atmosphere are two important requirements that should be met
simultaneously for practical application of perovskite-based ceramic
membranes in the oxy-fuel combustion process especially if the
four-end mode is to be utilized [69]. Most mixed conducting ceramic
materials contain alkaline-earth elements like Ca, Sr, or Ba. Due to
the presence of these elements, carbonates formation would occur
when these membranes are exposed to a CO2-containing atmo-
sphere. This reaction results in the formation of an alkaline-earth
carbonate layer on the membrane surface that is impermeable to
oxygen; leading to a decline in oxygen flux or even to a non-perme-
ating membrane. CO2 resistance of an alkaline-earth-containing

Pmaterial based on its carbonate formation at a specific temperature
and CO2 partial pressure can be theoretically assessed using the
Ellingham diagram (Fig. 7) [70]. The dashed lines denote the chemi-
cal potential of CO2 at a particular CO2 partial pressure while the
bold continuous lines denote the chemical potential of CO2 for
decomposition of a particular carbonate; both are functions of tem-
perature. The stability of a particular carbonate is estimated by
comparing the CO2 chemical potential at a particular CO2 partial
pressure and temperature against the decomposition chemical
potential at the same temperature. If the former is lower than the
latter, the carbonate is thermodynamically unstable.

PA highly oxygen-permeable material SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d for exam-
ple, showed a decrease in oxygen flux to almost zero within 100 h
when CO2 was used as sweep gas [71]. To increase the CO2 tolerance
of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d membranes, Sr2+ was partially substituted with
La3+ [72], or Co/Fe with Ti4+ [71], Zr4+ [73], Ta5+ [74] or Nb5+ [75].
This improvement in CO2 tolerance is however attained at the
expense of a decrease in oxygen flux [76]. Besides partial substitu-
tion, the dual-phase OTMs can be adopted to improve CO2-tolerance
[77,78] despite their relatively poor oxygen permeabilities. There is

Palso a correlation between the stability and the oxygen chemical
potential where the CO2 tolerance was reported to increase with
increasing oxygen partial pressure in the CO2-containing gas
[76,78]. For example, long-term oxygen permeation tests at 900 °C
showed that the use of oxygen-enriched air as the feed and pure CO2
as the sweep gas can prevent the structure degradation of the dual-
phase Ce0.8Gd0.15Cu0.02O2-d-SrFeO3-d (CGCO-SFO) membrane with-
out reducing its high oxygen permeability of 0.84 mL cm¡2 min¡1
[78]. The impacts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on the oxygen permeation
of perovskite, which is nearly inevitable in the case of flue gas from
power plant, have also been investigated [79]. The oxygen perme-
ability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d hollow fiber membranes, for exam-
ple, was reported to be reduced with small amount of SO2 added in
the sweep gas, and this poisoning effect was irreversible [80]. The
dense uniform and smooth inner surface of fresh membrane could
be severely damaged after SO2 exposure resulting from the decom-
position of the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d material and the formation of
SrSO4. It is therefore necessary to remove SO2 on the flue gas prior to
the perovskite membrane unit in oxy-fuel power plant or to develop
SO2-tolerable oxygen permeation membrane material. Despite the

Ppromising technology for use in oxy-fuel combustion CO2 capture
process, continuous development in high-performance OTM materi-
als with improved mechanical strength is still needed. The integra-
tion of OTM reactor into the oxy-fuel combustion process also
requires proper design and analysis.

3. Perovskites in solid oxide fuel cells

PIn addition to the oxy-fuel combustion application, perovskites
also have applications in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). SOFCs are high-
temperature electrochemical devices which directly convert the
chemical energy to the electricity with high efficiency, low emis-
sions, and fuel flexibility [81-83]. They operate at an energy effi-
i.e., double that of conventional
ciency of higher than 80%,
combustion-based power generation [84]. The fuel flexibility allows
SOFCs to use hydrocarbon fuels and thus, act as a bridging technol-
ogy between hydrocarbon- and future hydrogen-based economies
[81]. The main components of SOFCs systems are stacks, which are
constructed from single cells, interconnectors, sealant, and other
auxiliary cell components. As the most important part of SOFCs, the
single cell is typically composed of a porous cermet anode and a
porous oxide cathode, with a dense electrolyte sandwiching this
anode-cathode pair (Fig. 8). The cathode functions as the catalyst for
the electrocatalytic reduction of molecular oxygen to oxygen ions by
providing electrons that are transferred from the anode. The anode
catalyzes the oxidation of fuel by oxygen ions that diffused from the
cathode through the electrolyte together with the simultaneous
release of electrons, which are transported through an external cir-
cuit to the cathode. Such electrons can be utilized to do work when
an external load is connected. The electrolyte can be grouped based
on its ion conducting phenomenon, i.e., oxide ionic conducting and
proton conducting. It needs to be fully dense to prevent gaseous fuel
from contacting air and burning. The interconnector is another
important component of SOFCs that separates the anode and

3.1. Perovskites as cathode materials

PLanthanum cobaltite-based perovskite-type oxides are typical
mixed conductors, which have been widely investigated as potential
cathodes of SOFCs with doped ceria electrolytes [86-90]. La1-
xSrxCoO3-d (LSC) perovskites shows favorable oxygen-ionic conduc-
tivity and ultra-high electronic conductivity of over 1000 S cm¡1
[91], but poor phase stability [92]. To solve the stability problem,
one effective strategy is the partial substitution of cobalt ion with
iron, leading to the development of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-d (LSCF) per-
ovskites [93-98]. After the substitution, the phase stability is greatly
the
improved. While the electronic conductivity is reduced,
maximum conductivity can still exceed 300 S cm¡1 for certain

LSCF is also reported to be favorably high, reaching »1 £ 10¡3 S cm¡1
at 750 °C for La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-d (measured by electron blocking
electrode technique) [100].

PAlthough the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides is directly
related to the B-site cation, the modification of the A-site cation
could lead to a change in the valence state and redox properties of
the B-site cations [1,101], thus altering the catalytic activity of the
oxides. There have been substantial efforts to modify the phase sta-
bility and electrochemical activity of LSC by replacing La with other
rare earth metals [102-105]. Takeda et al. [102] demonstrated the
substitution of La with Gd with the formation of Gd1-xSrxCoO3-d
oxides contribute negatively towards the electrode performance.
However, the replacement of La with Sm as represented by Sm1-
xSrxCoO3-d (SSC) perovskites introduced beneficial effect [103].
Those materials exhibit high conductivity with the maximum con-
ductivity up to 1000 S cm¡1 at x = 0.5 [104]. It was further demon-
strated that the overpotentials of SSC cathodes are relatively low
[105]. Dense thin-film Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-d electrode showed »50%
lower overpotential than La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d under the similar opera-
tion conditions [106]. The rate-determining step of oxygen reduction
over dense Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-d thin-film cathode was determined to be
the adsorption(cid:1)desorption of oxygen at the electrode surface, the
same as La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d electrode, yet the adsorption and desorption
rate constants of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-d was found to be approximately an
order of magnitude larger than the corresponding values of
La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d [106]. Despite the high surface exchange kinetics,
the low-temperature electrode performance of SSC is still insuffi-
cient. An area specific resistance of »20 V cm2 was obtained for a
single-phase SSC electrode at 500 °C measured by symmetric cell
test [107]. High-temperature permeation study demonstrated that
dense SSC membrane had only modest oxygen flux [108]. This sug-
gests that the oxygen ionic conductivity of SSC is relatively low at
reduced temperature resulting in the reduced TPB length.

PMixed conducting Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d was initially developed
by Shao et al. as a material for ceramic oxygen-separation membrane
or membrane reactor [33,41,109-111]. The oxygen permeation flux
of a mixed conducting membrane was conceived to be closely
related to the electronic and oxygen ionic conductivity of the mem-
brane material. BSCF was even reported to show higher oxygen per-
meability than SSC [17]. As a result, BSCF may be a promising
cathode material of Intermediate Temperature (IT)-SOFC. Shao and
Haile [17] were the first to investigate the performance of BSCF as a
cathode of IT-SOFC. Outstanding low-temperature electrode perfor-
mance was attained. A single cell based on a 20 mm-thick samaria-
doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte film with humidified (3% water vapor)
hydrogen as the fuel and air as the oxidant demonstrated maximum
power densities of 1010 mW cm¡2 at 600 °C. Liu et al. [112] reported
that by further reducing the thickness of gadolinium-doped ceria
(GDC) electrolyte to around 10 mm, an anode-supported single cell
with the BSCF cathode and a Ni-GDC cermet anode achieved peak
power densities of 1329, 863, 454, 208, and 83 mW cm¡2 at 600,
550, 500, 450, and 400 °C, respectively. A combined in-situ neutron
diffraction and thermo-gravimetric study yielded unusually high
values for the oxygen non-stoichiometry in BSCF of d = 0.7(cid:1)0.8
between 600 and 900 °C in PO2 range of 0.001(cid:1)1 atm [113]. Excep-
tionally high concentrations of mobile oxygen vacancies pro-
nouncedly improved the oxygen reduction reaction process on BSCF
cathode at low temperature. Baumann et al. [114, 115] reported an
extremely low absolute value of
the electrochemical surface
exchange resistance of only »0.09 V cm2 at 750 °C in air, which is
more than 50 times lower than the corresponding value measured
for La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d microelectrodes utilizing similar geome-
try. The progress in understanding and development of BSCF-based
cathodes for IT-SOFCs has been summarized by Zhou et al. [116].

PIt is well-known that surface oxygen vacancies are beneficial
towards oxygen adsorption, dissociation and diffusion. However,
high bulk oxygen vacancy concentration may create a suppressing
effect on the electron polaron hopping in the perovskite lattice. To
this end, increasing oxygen non-stoichiometry was often accompa-
nied by reduction in electronic conductivity. Insufficient electrical
conductivity may also introduce a large charge-transfer resistance.
For example, BSCF has relatively low electrical conductivity of only
»40 S cm¡1 [117]. It was demonstrated that some donor-doped
SrCoO3-d perovskites possess both high oxygen vacancy concentra-
tion and electrical conductivity. Aguadero et al. [118] successfully
stabilized a tetragonal perovskite phase by replacing Co in the
SrCoO3-d system with 10 mol % of Sb5+. The thermal evolution of the
electrical conductivity of SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-d exhibits a maximum value
of 300 S cm¡1 at 400 °C. Lin et al. [119] reported that, on SDC electro-
lyte, SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-d electrode exhibit low polarization resistances
of 0.09 V cm2 in air at 700 °C under open-circuit conditions during
symmetric cell test. A detailed study of SrCo1-ySbyO3-d perovskites
showed that the composition with y = 0.05 has the lowest ASR values
ranging from 0.009 to 0.23 V cm2 in the 900(cid:1)600 °C temperature
range with an activation energy of only 0.82 eV [120]. It is likely that
the introduction of Sb5+ into SrCoO3-d provides an electron-doping
effect, thus, enhancing the mixed valence over the cobalt ion
and promoting the electrical conductivity. Zhou et al. [121, 122] syn-
thesized Nb-doped perovskite cathode, i.e., SrNb0.1Co0.9O3-d. This
material showed both high conductivity and oxygen vacancy con-
centration between 400(cid:1)600 °C. A cell utilizing SrNb0.1Co0.9O3-d as a
cathode delivered power density as high as 561 mW cm¡2 at 500 °C
in a SDC-based fuel cell.

PAs mentioned above, several perovskite compounds with cobalt
as the predominant B-site cation have high electrochemical perfor-
mance. However, most cobalt-rich compositions have high thermal
expansion coefficient (TEC) which might cause delamination of the
cathode from the electrolyte on thermal cycling. This disadvantage
is even more severe for BSCF perovskite since the TEC of BSCF is sub-
stantially larger than most electrolytes [123]. Due to this mismatch,
in some cases, the high TEC leads to the BSCF cathode peeled off
from the GDC|ScSZ(89ZrO2(cid:1)10Sc2O3(cid:1)1CeO2) electrolyte [124]. A
decrease in cobalt content might reduce the TEC of the cobalt-con-
taining materials, partially due to the depressed oxidation of cobalt
ion from Co3+ to Co4+ [113,125]. Nevertheless, over-substitution of
the cobalt ion may lead to a sharp increase in cathodic polarization
resistance for oxygen reduction reaction. The major challenge lies in
obtaining simultaneously a high electrocatalytic activity at low oper-
ation temperatures (normally obtained using cobalt-containing
materials) together with low TEC. The family of Sr-Co-O system
oxides with cubic perovskite crystal structure shows both the high
oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity. Zeng et al. [126] found that
scandium doping into the cobalt site in SrCoO3-d oxides effectively
stabilized the cubic perovskite structure in a wide temperature
range. It is very likely that doping small amount of Sc3+ effectively
stabilized the cobalt ion at the lower valence state and/or the high
spin state. Zhou et al. [127,128] utilized SrSc0.2Co0.8O3-d perovskite
as a cathode material for IT-SOFCs. The material showed an almost
linear thermal expansion from room temperature to 1000 °C in air
with average TEC of only 16.9 £ 10¡6 K¡1. The Sc-doping not only
dramatically reduced TEC but also brought about extremely high
oxygen vacancy concentrations in the lattice at low temperature.
The ASR of SrSc0.2Co0.8O3-d at 550 °C is only 0.206 V cm2. A peak
power density as high as 564 mW cm¡2 was obtained on a 20 mm
thick SDC electrolyte utilizing SrSc0.2Co0.8O3-d cathode at 500 °C.

PSome cobalt-free perovskite oxide materials have been devel-
oped as the cathodes to decrease the TEC. La(Ni,Fe)O3-d (LNF) has
been considered as an attractive material for cathode considering its
high electronic conductivity which reaches 580 S cm¡1 at 800 °C for
x = 0.4 [129]. Its thermal expansion coefficient is also compatible to

Pthat of the GDC which favors the thermomechanical stability of their
combination. Another advantage of these LNF cathodes is their resis-
tance against potential Cr poisoning which may diffuse from the cell
interconnect material [130]. Notwithstanding, some studies claim
problems associated with its reactivity towards GDC; the products of
which are poorly conducting phases at the electrolyte|cathode inter-
face [131,132]. Doping with strontium on the lanthanum site, La1-
ySryFe1-xNixO3-d, has been reported to increase the ionic conductivity
by introducing oxygen vacancies in the system but also provide the
detrimental effect of increasing the thermal expansion coefficient. Cu
doping in these systems has also been investigated, and fuel cells
containing LaNi0.2Fe0.8-xCuxO3 cathodes have been fabricated by Li
and Zhu [133]. The materials were prepared by the co-precipitation
method on which single phase samples were obtained for x < 0.15.
These fuel cells demonstrated good peak power densities of 635 and
763 mW cm¡2 at 580 and 650 °C, respectively. Hou et al. [134] syn-
thesized molybdenum-doped LaNiO3 (LaNi1-xMoxO3) which showed
acceptable electrochemical performance at 800 °C. The segregation of
La2MoO6 from nominal LaNi0.75Mo0.25O3-d introduces La vacancies,
which partially re-oxidizes Ni(II) to give mixed valence in the Ni(III)/
Ni(II) couple at 800 °C in air while leaving enough Mo(VI) to provide
randomly distributed oxygen vacancies [134].

PAnother group of cobalt-free perovskites are based on SrFeO3-d.
Conventionally, rare earth elements, e.g., La, have been used to par-
tially substitute Sr (represented for example by (La,Sr)FeO3-d (LSF))
to restrain the temperature-induced structure transformation
[135, 136]. This doped perovskite has a very low TEC which
matches well with SDC electrolytes. However, LSF does not deliver
satisfactory electrochemical performance as a cathode in IT-SOFCs.
Bi doping of SrFeO3-d results in the formation of a structure with
high symmetry and extraordinary electrochemical performance (i.
e., Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-d (BSF)) due to the presence of a lone electron pair
in Bi3+, which is not available in La3+ [137-139]. BSF also shows an
activation energy (Ea) of only 117 kJ mol¡1 for oxygen reduction
reaction which is relatively low relative to other cobalt-free catho-
des, i.e., 183 kJ mol¡1 for La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-d [140] and 142 kJ mol¡1 for
i.e., 164 kJ mol¡1 for
GaBaFe2O5+d
La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-d [140].

[141] and cobalt cathodes,

PCation-ordered double-perovskite structures such as LnBaCo2O5
+d (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) have also been investigated due to their
faster oxygen ion diffusion, faster surface oxygen exchange, and
higher electrical conductivity at lower temperatures than primitive
perovskite cathode materials [142-144]. Choi et al. [145] reported a
synergistic effect of co-doping in PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2(cid:1)xFexO5+d, which has
created pore channels that dramatically enhance oxygen ion diffu-
sion and surface oxygen exchange while maintaining excellent com-
patibility and stability under operating conditions. Test cells based
on these cathode materials demonstrated peak power densities of
710 and 2200 mW cm(cid:1)2 at 500 and 600 °C. Excellent stability and
activity under both air and CO2-containing atmosphere was
observed by doping Ca in A-site of the double-perovskite NdBa1(cid:1)x-
CaxCo2O5+d
[142]. A maximum power density of
2114 mW cm(cid:1)2 was reported at 600 °C and the cell performance of
NBCaCO was stable at 550 °C. Deng et al. [146] synthesized a B-site-
ordered double perovskite of Ba2CoMo0.5Nb0.5O6¡x (BCMN) where
its A-site is fully occupied by Ba. This compound showed potential
as SOFC cathode operating at 700 °C. Zhou et al. [147] reported that
the extraordinary cathode performance of Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6¡x
(BBSC) at 600 °C (0.22 V cm2) was due to its high oxygen vacancy
bulk diffusion and surface exchange rates, and high electrical con-
ductivity. BBSC also has a low TEC of 17.9 £ 10¡6 K¡1 due to the
absence of Co4+. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) analysis con-
firmed that Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8(cid:1)xO6(cid:1)d (x = 0.1 and 0.2, denoted as
BBSC0.1, and BBSC0.2, respectively) indeed has B-site cation-ordered
double perovskite structure [148]. In such double perovskite, the B-
site cations are ordered in Ba2BB0O6(cid:1)x formula with B = [Co2+] and

(NBCaCO)

PB0 = [Sc3+, Bi5+, Co3+]. This suggests the presence of two different Co
local environments in the BBSC, which may be beneficial in promot-
ing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.

PWhile considerable progress has been made in perovskite SOFC
cathodes, it remains difficult to produce an ideal cathode with high
electrical conductivity, good chemical and thermomechanical stabil-
ity, comparable thermal expansion with the electrolyte, and high
electrochemical activity for ORR. Nevertheless, the flexibility of the
perovskite structure with respect to doping and partial substitution
of A or B cations warrant their further study.

3.2. Perovskites as electrolyte materials

PThe electrolyte is responsible for conducting ions between the
electrodes, for the separation of the reacting gases, and for the inter-
nal electronic conduction blocking (i.e., forcing the electrons to flow
through the external circuit). It must be stable in both reducing and
oxidizing environments with sufficiently high ionic conductivity but
low electronic conductivity at the SOFC operating temperature [149].
Its electronic conductivity must be kept as low as possible to prevent
losses from leakage currents that will decrease the energy conversion
efficiency. The electrolyte can be grouped based on its conducting
species, i.e., oxygen ion conductors and proton conductors.

PIn oxygen ion conductors, current flow occurs by the movements
of oxide ions through the crystal lattice (Fig. 8(a)). This is a thermally
activated process wherein the oxygen ions hop from one crystal lat-
tice site to the other randomly. The ionic conduction depends on the
mobility of the ions and therefore, on the temperature. At high tem-
peratures, the conductivity can reach 1 S cm¡1, which is of the same
order of magnitude as for liquid electrolytes [150]. High oxygen ion
conductivity has been reported in perovskite-structured oxide
derived from lanthanum gallate (LaGaO3), in particular the La1-
xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-d (LSGM) series [151]. The partial substitution of lan-
thanum for strontium and the incorporation of divalent magnesium
cations into the gallium sub-lattice increase the concentration of
oxygen vacancies within the material. Using transition metal doping,
the electrical conductivity of LSGM is much improved relative to YSZ
and doped ceria (Fig. 9). The introduction of a small amount of Ni
onto the B-site of LSGM was found to improve performance without

Pintroducing electronic conductivity [152]. The problem of LSGM is
on the anode-electrolyte side. The dissolution of NiO into LSGM
phase takes place significantly during the high-temperature sinter-
ing process of cells [153]. Electronic shorting paths inside the LSGM
electrolyte may occur, whereby NiO in LSGM is reduced to Ni metal
by hydrogen.

PThe performance of SOFC using oxygen-ion conducting electro-
lyte decreases sharply with decreasing temperature due to the high
activation energy for oxygen ion conduction. Another type of prom-
ising electrolyte is proton conductors [154-156] (Fig. 8(b)). Facile
proton migration in the proton conductors makes them very attrac-
tive electrolyte materials for IT-SOFCs operating at 350(cid:1)600 °C. Pro-
ton conductors demonstrate proton conductivity when exposed to
hydrogen and/or water vapor atmospheres. Protonic defects are
formed by the dissociative absorption of water at the surface, which
requires the presence of oxide-ion vacancies. Water from the gas-
phase dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a proton, with the
hydroxide ion filling an oxide-ion vacancy and the proton forming a
covalent bond with a lattice oxygen. This reaction can be written
according to Kr€oger(cid:1)Vink notation [157]:

PAmong perovskite-structured oxides, BaCeO3-based materials are
regarded as benchmark materials for their high and nearly pure pro-
ton conductivity [158]. Nonetheless, doped BaCeO3 materials have
been proved to be chemically unstable in acidic and amphoteric
gases,
i.e., CO2, SO2, and H2O so that carbonates, sulfates, and
hydroxides might be produced [159]. The poor chemical stability
of BaCeO3 is not surprising considering its perovskite structure
instability below 631 °C relative to the constituent oxides [160].
Partial replacement of Ce4+ by Zr4+ which yields oxides of the type
BaCe1-x-yZrxYyO3-d has been suggested as a highly effective method
to improve the chemical stability of cerates, yet this stability trades
off the original proton conductivity and sinterability [161]. Yang
et al. [162] reported that BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2-xYbxO3-d exhibits high ionic
conductivity at relatively low temperatures (500 to 700 °C). Using Yb
doping, the material shows the ability to resist deactivation by sulfur
and coking; attributed to the mixed conductor's enhanced catalytic
activity for sulfur oxidation and hydrocarbon cracking and reforming
as well as enhanced water adsorption capability.

PThe relatively high proton conductivity and high chemical stabil-
ity in CO2-rich atmosphere has made barium cerate and zirconate
perovskites as a promising solid electrolyte material. However, the
required high sintering temperature may cause stoichiometry losses
and further reduction of the conductivity. More work is needed to
improve and/or develop the synthesis methods and processing tech-
niques to achieve low-sintering temperature without compromising
the electrolyte performance.

3.3. Perovskites as anode materials

PA major advantage of SOFCs is that they have much greater fuel
flexibility due to the fact that O2¡ anions are the only species trans-
ported through the electrolyte, allowing SOFC to operate on any
combustible fuel. The Ni cermets show excellent electrochemical
performance in H2, yet the material can be degraded by interaction
with various contaminants in the fuel. Sulfur in the fuel gas is a
potent poison for the nickel electrocatalyst. The Ni cermets are also
affected by H2S at the ppm level, the poisoning effect of which may
be irreversible. Ni may also catalyze the coking in CO at low temper-
atures [163]. The coking may result in the loss of Ni from the anode
through a corrosion process [164].

PSubstantial effort has been devoted to the development of new
anode materials to overcome these problems. Ceria-based anodes
(Cu/ceria composite anode or Ru/ceria catalyst layer) have demon-
strated great potential for direct use of hydrocarbons in a SOFC
[165-167]. However, low melting point of Cu makes it difficult to
fabricate anode-supported cells using conventional co-firing ceramic
methods. Furthermore, poor catalytic activity of Cu for fuel oxidation
limits cell power output. Moreover, Ru/ceria thin layer also
decreases power density thus causing difficulty in current collection
and it also increases cost of fuel cell.

PPerovskite oxides have been evaluated as alternatives to metal-
ceria based systems due to their high ionic and electronic conductiv-
ity, compositional flexibility, and stability in the reducing atmo-
sphere. The most widely studied perovskites are titanates and
chromites. SrTiO3 is a good electronic conductor at low oxygen par-
tial pressures; its ionic conductivity can be increased by doping
selected metals. With yttrium doping on the A-site of SrTiO3, the
electrical conductivity of SrTiO3 reaches 100 S cm¡1 [168, 169]. The
conductivity can also be improved by doping niobium on the B-site
[170]. However, the electrocatalytic activity for H2 oxidation is very
poor on these materials [171]. Doped LaCrO3-based materials are
used as interconnects in high-temperature SOFCs and are stable in
reducing environments. Strontium-doped LaCrO3 does not catalyze
carbon deposition and thus can be used as an anode. The B-site of
strontium-doped LaCrO3 has been doped with various transition
metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) to introduce oxygen vacancies [172,173].
Among these materials, La1-xSrxCr0.5Mn0.5O3-d perovskites showed
good activity for oxidation of both H2 and CH4 [172,173].

PDouble-perovskite Sr2MgMoO6 was also reported to be a promis-
ing anode material that demonstrates long-term stability with good
sulfur tolerance and superior single-cell performance in hydrogen
and methane at 800 °C [174]. The valence states and the electro-
chemical performances of
the double-perovskites Sr2MMoO6
(M = Co, Ni) anodes were subsequently investigated by the same
research group [175]. Sengodan et al. [176] reported that double
perovskite PrBaMn2O5+d (PBM) can be used as high-performance
anode. The layered PBM anode also showed stability in anode opera-
tion conditions and exhibited high sulfur and coking tolerance under
various fuel conditions. These anodes’ catalytic activity, electrical
conductivity, and power density nonetheless are still substantially
lower than those for the conventional Ni-YSZ anode [176].

PAlbeit significant progress made in the development of perov-
skite SOFC anodes, significant challenges remain particularly their
low catalytic activity compared with Ni. This opens up a new and
promising research avenues to develop perovskite anodes with high
catalytic activity and unprecedented electronic conductivity.

4. Perovskite membrane reactors

PAnother important application of perovskites is in OTM-based
membrane reactors. In the past two decades, perovskite-based OTM
reactors as the devices combining the separation and chemical reac-
tions in a single unit have attracted immense attention. The advan-
tages of perovskite-based OTM reactors used in reactions are: (1)
avoiding the costly separation of the nitrogen from air; (2) the equi-
librium constraint of many reversible reactions can be overcome by
removal of one or more products through the membrane, thus further
increasing the conversion; and (3) the gradual introduction of oxygen
reduces contact with the partially oxidized products, which avoids
the further oxidation thus enhances the yield of the desired products
[177-179]. Moreover, they offer several advantages over conventional
reactors including significant process intensification due to in-site O2
separation from the reaction mixture, lower energy consumption as
they can be operated at mild temperatures, efficient energy integra-
tion, and relatively safe in operation [180]. The typical functions of
perovskite oxide membranes in membrane reactors can be classified

Pinto two groups: (1) selectivity enhancement in distributor type
membrane reactors, and (2) conversion enhancement in extractor
type membrane reactors. The distributor configuration has the benefit
of the establishment of uniform species concentrations along the
reactor that leads to higher selectivity. This type of membrane reactor
has widely been studied for partial oxidation of methane (POM) to
syngas and oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). In the case of the
extractor configuration in which the membrane is utilized to selec-
tively remove a product from the reaction zone. Most work on prod-
uct removal has addressed coupling reactions with water splitting.

4.1. Distributor type perovskite membrane reactors

P4.1.1. Partial oxidation of methane (POM)

POne of the most commercial applications of perovskite oxides
membrane reactors are the production of syngas through POM via
the following reaction [181]:
CH4 þ 0:5O2 ! CO þ 2H2; DH0

1⁄4 (cid:1)35:7 kJ mol

PDuring the past years, most of the research efforts has been
focused onto: (1) developing novel membrane materials which can
be stable for long-time operation at elevated temperatures under
strongly reducing atmosphere such as the mixture of carbon monox-
ide and hydrogen at the less loss of oxygen permeability; (2) the
modification of membrane surface to improve the oxygen surface
exchange or as a catalyst for POM; and (3) designing membrane
reactors with new configurations. Table 2 lists the POM performance
of different membrane materials and different configurations
[34, 52,178,182-202].

PSeveral research studies focused on the surface modification
of the membrane to improve the performance of POM in the
membrane reactor. Yaremchenko et al. [178] studied the POM
performance in (SrFe)0.7(SrAl2)0.3Oz membrane reactor, where
(SrFe)0.7(SrAl2)0.3Oz was used both as a membrane reactor and cata-
lyst. At 950 °C, the CH4 conversion rose from 5.2% at 850 °C to 16.1%
and the CO selectivity varied in the range of 7.6(cid:1)13.9%. In Ba0.5Sr0.5-
Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d (BSCF) membrane reactor packed with Ni/ZrO2 cata-
lyst, a cross-shaped pattern was formed on the surface by laser
ablation [179]. At 850 °C, 91.5% CO selectivity, 98.8% CH4 conversion,
and about 11.0 mL cm¡2 min¡1 oxygen flux was achieved. Tan et al.
[203] also reported increased oxygen flux and methane conversion
due to the Pt coating on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d hollow fiber mem-
brane. The effect of catalysts on the performance of POM in

Pperovskite oxides membrane reactors has also been reported else-
where [204, 205]. The mathematical modeling of POM in the cata-
lytic perovskite-based membrane reactor has also been conducted
to improve the understanding of the process and to compare the
performance with conventional reactors [206, 207].

PCoke oven gas (COG) is a by-product generated in the coke pro-
duction from coal process at 800 °C. It is a potential raw material for
syngas or hydrogen production via partial oxidation of methane. The
main components of COG are 54(cid:1)59% H2, 24(cid:1)31% CH4, and 5.5(cid:1)7%
CO [208]. Several studies reported that complete utilization of
hydrogen can be realized via the reforming of COG in perovskite
oxides membrane reactors [209-211]. Cheng et al. [209] studied the
performance of reforming of COG in a BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-d mem-
brane reactor combined with a Ru-Ni/Mg(Al)O catalyst and reported
13.3 mL cm¡2 min¡1 oxygen flux, 100% toluene conversion, 73.4%
CH4 conversion, 79.2% CO2 conversion, 75.5% H2 yield, and 78.6% CO
yield at 875 °C. Yang et al. [210] also studied the performance of
reforming of COG in the same material membrane reactor (BaCo0.7-
Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-d) combined with a NiO/MgO solid solution catalyst and
found a result of 16.3 mL cm¡2 min¡1 oxygen flux, 95% CH4 conver-
sion, 80% H2 yield, and 106% CO yield at 875 °C.

PDespite considerable research and development of OTMs for
POM, they must be chemically and mechanically stable at elevated
temperatures in a large oxygen gradient with one side of the mem-
brane is exposed to oxidizing atmosphere (i.e., air) while the other
side is exposed to the reducing atmosphere (i.e., mixture of H2 and
CO). The requirement on the stability of the membrane materials
may be reduced with the application of two-stage membrane reactor
(Fig. 10) [212]. In this reactor, part of the methane is converted into
CO2 and H2O by reaction with oxygen permeated through the mem-
brane. The resultant mixture is then transferred to a catalyst bed
where the remaining CH4 is reformed to syngas.

PIn terms of the strategy for developing and operating the mem-
brane reactor, the two-stage membrane reactor configuration allows
for the distribution of the overall risk among the two separate com-
ponents. This is conducive to the energy consumption because the
heat released by the deep oxidation of part of the methane at the
membrane stage of the reactor is supplied to the catalyst bed where
endothermic reforming reactions take place [212]. The as-produced
syngas is desirable for applications because it contains no N2 and has
a lower H2/CO ratio compared to the regular methane steam reform-
ing. The emission of NOx is eliminated due to the use of an OTM that
is impermeable to N2. Despite their promise for application to POM,

Pmembrane surface to form water which then participates in the
reaction via steam reforming. Fan et al. [217] also compared the per-
formance of the carbon dioxide reforming of methane in SrFeCo0.5Ox
membrane and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d membrane system, which
also shows show the better performance in Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d
membrane reactors and could be more suitable for low-temperature
oxygen-assisted reactions.

P4.1.3. Oxidation reforming of heptane

PAnother typical example of oxidative reforming applications in
perovskite oxides membrane reactor is the oxidative of liquid fuels
to carbon monoxide/hydrogen mixtures. Liquid hydrocarbons, i.e.,
naphtha, gasoline, diesel oil, and kerosene could be on-board hydro-
gen sources in the near future and heptane was selected as a typical
component of them.

ð13Þ
PZhu et al. [218] investigated the oxidation reforming of heptane
to generate syngas in a disk Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d membrane reac-
tor packed with LiLaNiO/g-Al2O3 catalyst. At 850 °C, a heptane con-
version of 100%, a CO selectivity of 91(cid:1)93%, and H2 selectivity of
95(cid:1)97% were achieved. The process was further studied in three dif-
ferent modified configurations: the first membrane reactor only had
a bare membrane without any catalyst; the second one possessed a
modified membrane, which was prepared through a pretreatment
with a small quantity of catalyst powder at 1040 °C; the third one
had 400 mg catalyst on the membrane, which formed a catalyst bed
[219]. The reforming catalyst LiLaNiO/g-Al2O3 with 10 wt. % Ni was
used in this system. It was reported that the different treatments of
catalyst have substantial effects on the reforming reactions in the
dense ceramic membrane reactor. On the basis of the results in three
membrane reactors, a reaction pathway of hydrocarbon reforming
in dense ceramic membrane reactor was proposed (Fig. 11): (1)
most hydrocarbons react directly with the active oxygen species on
the modified membrane surface first to produce CO, CO2, H2O, and
H2; (2) unreacted active oxygen species recombine into gas-phase
oxygen quickly and diffuse away from the membrane surface; and
(3) unreacted hydrocarbons reforms with CO2, H2O, and a small
amount of gas-phase oxygen in the catalyst bed [219].

P4.1.4. Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM)

PAnother application of methane in perovskite oxides membrane

reactors is OCM, represented by following equations [181]:

PIn some cases, the perovskite oxides membrane itself served as a
catalyst. The main challenge of the reforming process is the low
selectivity to C2, since C2 (C2H4 and C2H6) products are more reactive

(Reprinted from [212] with permission of John Wiley and Sons, Inc).

Pthe two-stage membrane reactors are likely to face challenges in the
reactor fabrication techniques and the scale-up.

P4.1.2. Oxidation reforming of methane

PSyngas can be obtained by steam reforming of methane (SRM)
and carbon dioxide reforming of methane via the following reactions

PAs shown above, the H2/CO ratio from SRM is 3, which is unsuit-
able for methanol or the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The SRM is also
highly endothermic and require large amounts of energy. Zhang
et al. [214] investigated the oxidative steam reforming of methane
(OSRM) process in a thin tubular Al2O3-doped SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3¡d mem-
brane reactor packed with a Ni/g-Al2O3 catalyst, which couples exo-
thermic POM and endothermic SRM reactions in the same side of
the membrane for generating syngas. The advantages of the OSRM
in membrane reactors: (1) the H2/CO ratio for efficient syngas pro-
duction can be tuned by adjusting the participation of the POM or
SEM reaction; and (2) the OSRM process is expected to be operated
auto-thermally. The results show that both the reaction temperature
and H2O/CH4 rate are key factors effluence the CO selectivity, H2/CO
rate and heat equilibrium of the reactions. Between 850(cid:1)900 °C,
methane and steam conversions were larger than 93% with the CO
selectivity larger than 91%.

PSlade et al. [215] studied the performance of carbon dioxide
reforming of methane reactions in a SrFeCo0.5Ox membrane reactor
packed with a Pt/ZrO2 catalyst with a feeding ratio of CO2/CH4 = 1:1.
For comparison, the performance was investigated in a blank boron
nitride coated stainless steel membrane reactor, and the oxygen was
co-fed with carbon dioxide and methane. It shows a methane con-
version three times higher with the membrane than with any
amount of co-fed oxygen. The results suggest that oxygen supplied
by the OTMs is more reactive than co-fed molecular oxygen. Slade
et al. [216] then studied the performance of the coupling reactions
on SrFeCo0.5Ox membrane and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d membrane
packed with Pt/ZrO2 or Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst. They found that
Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d membrane exhibited significantly higher
flux than that for SrFeCo0.5Ox membrane and that the Pt/CeZrO2 cat-
alyst was significantly more active than the Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. They
the
stated that membrane oxygen reacts with hydrogen at

Pthan the reactant (CH4) and easy to be oxidized. The incorporation
of the perovskite oxides membrane reactor can improve the effi-
ciency through gradual introduction of oxygen. It has been estimated
that a single-pass conversion of 35(cid:1)37% and selectivity of 85(cid:1)88%
(equivalent to a C2 yield of >30%) is required to attain commercial
competitiveness for OCM [220]. The performance of OCM in
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d disk-shaped membrane reactors was studied
by ten Elshof et al. [221] and very low C2 yields (0.25(cid:1)3%) were
obtained. Wang et al. [222] compared the performance of the
Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d membrane tube was employed as a reactor
for the OCM reaction without catalyst and the packed-bed reactor
using BSCF as catalyst. They found an increase of C2 selectivity by
20% and obtained about 62% C2 selectivity when 93% of CH4 concen-
tration at 850 °C. When the BSCF membrane tube was packed with
an active OCM catalyst (La-Sr/CaO), the highest C2 yield of 15%
was achieved at 850 °C.

PA comparative study was investigated by modifying disk
Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d membrane surface with three different cata-
lysts for OCM: Pt/MgO, Sr/La2O3 and LaSr/CaO. LaSr/CaO provided
the highest yield between 900 and 1000 °C and a C2-hydrocarbon
yield of more than 18% with a CH4 concentration of 34% was
achieved (at a selectivity of more than 65%) at 950 °C [221]. Tan and
Li [223] studied the performance of OCM in a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d
perovskite hollow fiber membrane reactor. A maximum C2 yield of
15.3% with a corresponding selectivity of 43.8% was obtained at
950 °C. However, noticeable gaseous oxygen was found in the prod-
uct stream with the concentration of 4(cid:1)6% and the total amount of
oxygen provided by the blank membrane reactor was larger than
the amount consumed by OCM reaction. They then packed addi-
tional SrTi0.9Li0.1O3-d catalysts for OCM reaction inside the La0.6Sr0.4-
Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d hollow fiber membrane reactor [224]. Compared to
the performance in the blank LSCF hollow fiber membrane, they
observed a remarkable increase in methane conversion and oxygen
permeation rate with a decrease in C2 selectivity. A maximum C2
yield of around 21% can be achieved in the packed catalyst hollow
fiber membrane reactor at 975 °C.

PCzuprat et al. [225] studied the performance in a BaCoxFeyZrzO3-d
(x + y + z = 1) hollow fiber membrane reactor packed with a 2 wt. %
Mn/5 wt. % Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst. At 800 °C, the highest C2 selectiv-
ity of about 75% was obtained at a CH4 conversion of 6% with a C2H4:
C2H6 ratio of 2:1, the highest C2H4:C2H6 ratio of 4:1 and maximum
C2 yield of 17% (at 50% C2 selectivity). Bhatia et al. [226] studied the
OCM reaction in a supported tubular Ba0.5Ce0.4Gd0.1Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d
membrane with a Na-W-Mn/SiO2 catalyst on the support. This
reactor showed C2 yield up to 34.7% with CH4 conversion of
51.6%, C2 selectivity of 67.4% and oxygen permeation flux of
1.4 mL cm¡2 min¡1 at 850 °C.

P4.1.5. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane

PEthylene is a key intermediate chemical feedstock in chemical
industry and ethylene is currently produced by the steam cracking
of ethane, ethane-propane mixture, naphtha or heavier feed stocks,
which is a strong endothermic reaction with intensive energy
consumption and extensive coke formation. Oxidative dehydro-
genation of ethane to ethylene (ODE) is exothermic and involves
coke formation. The presence of oxygen limits the coke forma-
tion. However, the co-feed oxygen or enriched air contribution
to reactor would cause ODE reaction to be thermodynamically
favored towards undesired combustion reactions and the lower
yield of ethylene. Meanwhile, the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane to propene (ODP) suffers from the same problems as
ODE. The introduction of perovskite oxide membrane reactor to
ODE and ODP would avoid direct contact of oxygen and alkanes,
and therefore limits the side reactions. Generally, an ethylene
yield of at least 70% is required to replace the existing technol-
ogy for commercial applications [227].

PMost research studies on ODE have been focused on different
membrane materials, different membrane configurations, surface
modification, and catalysts. Rebeilleau-Dassonneville et al. [228,229]
studied the performance of ODE in a disk Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d
membrane reactor with different catalytic modifications (Ni cluster,
V MgO micron grain, and Pd nano cluster) on the permeate side. A
decrease in ethane conversion and unaltered ethylene selectivity
was observed after Ni cluster deposition on the membrane. Mean-
while, long-term stable operation (i.e., 23 days) and ethylene yields
of about 75% were observed at temperatures of 767 °C or 777 °C
when using membranes with V MgO micron grain or Pd nano cluster
modification respectively. These results indicated the importance of
surface exchange for oxygen permeation. Wang et al. [230] studied
the performance of ODE in a BaCoxFeyZrzO3-d (x + y + z = 1) hollow
fiber membrane. The BaCoxFeyZrzO3-d catalytic activity for ODE was
studied in a packed bed reactor. BaCoxFeyZrzO3-d demonstrated a
moderate catalytic activity at low temperature. Comparing the ODE
using the BaCoxFeyZrzO3-d disk and hollow fiber membrane reactors,
the best ethylene selectivity was about 64% lower than the 79%
selectivity which was obtained in the BaCoxFeyZrzO3-d disk-shaped
membrane. This was due to the long contact time in the hollow fiber
membrane reactor which leads to more pronounced oxidation of
ethylene/ethane to CO and CO2.

PA multi-zone (dehydrogenation and oxidation zones, which was
prepared by coating part of the membrane surface with gold paste)
(x + y + z = 1) hollow fiber membrane reactor
BaCoxFeyZrzO3¡d
packed with dehydrogenation catalyst (Actisorb 410, S€udchemie,
Cr2O3 on Ca aluminate) was proposed [231]. This membrane geome-
try allowed more precise control of oxygen feeding into the reactor
over its axial length and provided a low average oxygen concentra-
tion compared to traditional membrane reactors, which gave high
ethane selectivity by selectivity burning off in situ the hydrogen
from conventional catalytic dehydrogenation. At 725 °C, the highest
ethane conversion was achieved around 95(cid:1)100% with an ethylene
selectivity of approximately 55%; the highest ethylene selectivity
was 70% at an ethane conversion of around 52%. The optimization of
the operating conditions in a perovskite oxides membrane reactor of
ODE is studied based on Soft Computing techniques and the highest
yield of ethylene in the optimization exceeded 87% [232].

PThe same multi-zone BaCoxFeyZrzO3¡d (x + y + z = 1) hollow fiber
membrane reactor was also used for the oxidative dehydrogenation
of propane (ODP) [233]. By using this novel hollow fiber membrane
reactor packed with a Pt/Sn/K ODP catalyst, oxygen separation and
propene formation could be established even at temperatures as low
as 625 °C with long term stability. The highest propene selectivity of
75% was observed with a propane conversion of 26% at 625 °C (88%
total olefin selectivity) whereas the highest propene yield of 36%
was obtained with 48% propene selectivity and 75% propane conver-
sion at 725 °C (total olefin yield amounts 69%). Czuprat et al. [234]
studied the mechanistic aspects of propane dehydrogenation with
catalytic selective hydrogen combustion in the BaCoxFeyZrzO3¡d hol-
low fiber membrane reactor packed with a commercial Pt-Sn dehy-
drogenation catalyst by transient analysis of products with a sub-
millisecond time resolution. The formation of gas phase O2 on the
permeate side should be avoided to achieve a high propene selectiv-
ity at high propane conversions. It is essential to control the ratio of
the H2 and C3H8/C3H6 oxidation rates over the membrane and the
diffusion rate of oxygen ions through the membrane.

P4.1.6. Selective oxidation of ammonia

PPerovskite oxides membrane reactors are also used for selective
oxidation of ammonia to NO by some researchers [235-237]. NO pro-
duced from ammonia is the raw material required to produce nitric
acid. The traditional technology relies upon oxidizing ammonia on
Pt-Rh alloy gauzes, which has not been used for 80 years. The main
drawbacks of the technology are: (1) metal loss of the catalyst in

Preaction process; (2) high production cost; and (3) the production of
N2O, an environmentally harmful gas. Perovskite oxides membrane
roles in this reaction are two-folds, i.e., as a separator and catalyst
for ammonia oxidation. Ammonia is fed to the reaction side of the
membrane while air is simultaneously fed to the other side of the
membrane. The selective oxidation of ammonia were performed
in La1-xAxFeO3-d (A = Ca, Sr; x = 0.1(cid:1)0.2) [235] and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8-
Fe0.2O3-d [237] membranes; the results of which show high NO selec-
tivity and no N2O formation.

4.2. Extractor type perovskite membrane reactors

P4.2.1. Coupling reactions with water splitting (WS)

PIn the past 30 years, immense research efforts have been per-
formed to study direct
thermochemical water splitting (WS).
Although water decomposition into oxygen and hydrogen is concep-
tually simple, efficient hydrogen production from water remains dif-
ficult due to the low equilibrium constant of KP (cid:6) 2 £ 10 ¡ 8 at 950 °C.

PSignificant amounts of hydrogen or oxygen can be generated
at moderate temperatures if the equilibrium is shifted toward
dissociation by removing either oxygen or hydrogen instan-
taneously. A maximum H2 production rate of 6 mL cm¡2 min¡1
was achieved by Balachandran et al.
in a 0.10 mm-thick Gd-
doped CeO2 and Ni composite membrane by feeding H2 to the
permeated side at 900 °C [238]. However, the generation of
hydrogen at the feed side of the membrane is traded-off by the
loss of the same amounts of hydrogen at the permeate side (that
consumes the permeated oxygen).

PJiang et al. [239,240] first studied WS coupling POM in a BaCox-
FeyZr1-x-yO3-d (BCFZ) hollow fiber membrane packed with Ni-based
catalysts in POM reaction side. Simultaneous production of hydrogen
and synthesis gas can be obtained. At 950 °C, a H2 production rate of
3.1 mL cm¡2 min¡1 with a CH4 conversion of 70% and CO selectivity
of 60% was achieved [239]. For a better performance, the surface of
the BCFZ hollow fiber membrane was modified by coating a catalyti-
cally active BCFZ-Pd porous layer [240]. Results showed that the
oxygen permeation flux of the BCFZ membrane with a BCFZ-Pd
porous layer increased 3.5 times relative to the blank BCFZ mem-
brane (when feeding reactive CH4 onto the permeation side of the
membrane). The hydrogen production rate was also increased from
0.7 to 2.1 mL cm¡2 min¡1 at 950 °C after depositing a BCFZ-Pd porous
layer onto BCFZ membrane.

PJiang et al. [241] combined WS with ODE in a BaCoxFeyZr1-x-yO3-d
(BCFZ) hollow fiber membrane to generate hydrogen and ethylene.
Water dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen on the core side of the
membrane. The oxygen produced was then removed as oxygen ions
to the shell side and reacted with ethane to produce ethylene
and water. As a result, a hydrogen production rate of around
1.0 mL cm¡2 min¡1 with ethylene yield of around 53% (with 59% of
ethane conversion and 89% of ethylene selectivity) was achieved at
800 °C.Among the various ethanol reforming routes for H2 produc-
tion, auto-thermal reforming of ethanol, and more generally oxida-
tive steam reforming of ethanol (OSRE), is an attractive option via
the following reaction [242]:
C2H5OH þ 2H2O þ 0:5O2 ! 2CO2 þ 5H2; DH0

298K

1⁄4 (cid:1)68:3 kJ mol

(cid:1)1

ð17Þ

PThe OSRE has been widely investigated in the catalytic fixed-bed
and micro-channel reactors. Most of these works focused on the
development of high efficiency catalyst. Park et al. [242] first investi-
gated the OSRE with air as oxygen source in La0.7Sr0.3Cu0.2Fe0.8O3-d
membrane reactor . At 700 °C, an ethanol conversion of 58.7% with

Pan H2 production rate of about 0.12 mL cm¡2 min¡1 was achieved at
an H2O/EtOH (ethanol) ratio of 3. Zhu et al. [243] developed a highly
effective and sustainable route for H2 production, which combines
WS with OSRE in a tubular SrCo0.4Fe0.5Zr0.1O3-d membrane reactor
packed with Ni/Al2O3. WS takes place at the tube side of the
membrane and the OSRE occurs at the shell side simultaneously
or, equivalently, ethanol and water react with oxygen, which
permeates through the membrane upon water dissociation, to pro-
duce H2 and CO2 over supported transition metal catalysts. By
coupling OSRE with WS reactions on the opposite sides of the oxy-
gen permeable membrane, hydrogen production rates of 6.8 and
1.8 mL cm¡2 min¡1, respectively, were achieved at 750 °C.

PCao et al. [244] reported the combination of thermal water split-
ting with the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane and
ethylene in a novel asymmetric Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d disc mem-
brane with 2 wt. % Mn-5 wt. % Na2WO4 catalyst. Oxygen produced
from thermal water splitting was transported through the dense
BSCF membrane and consumed during the coupling of methane. At
950 °C, about 9% of the injected H2O was converted to hydrogen
with a production rate of about 3.3 mL cm¡2 min¡1 with 26% of CH4
conversion and 6.5% C2 selectivity. Fang et al. [245] presented water
splitting coupled with POM by means of a dual-phase OTM based on
Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925
(25 wt. %)
(SDC-SSAF) with a sandwich-like symmetrical structure. The perfor-
mance of the membrane reactor degraded as a result of catalyst
deactivation (i.e., coking). It was demonstrated that the catalyst can
be regenerated in situ in a single unit by conducting the water split-
ting reaction on the catalyst-deactivated side. Li et al. [246] demon-
strated a membrane reactor consisting of an OTM and catalyst to co-
produce ammonia synthesis gas (ASG) and liquid-fuel synthesis gas
(LFSG) from water, air, and methane in single step. In the membrane
reactor, there is no direct CO2 emission and CO or H2S is absent in
the ammonia synthesis gas. The energy consumption for the produc-
tion of the two synthesis gases can be reduced by 63 % using this
membrane reactor.

P4.2.2. Thermal decomposition of carbon dioxide (TDCD) coupling with
POM

PThermal decomposition of carbon dioxide (TDCD) to CO and O2 is
a potential route for the consumption and utilization of CO2 via the
following reaction:
CO2 $ CO þ 0:5O2; DH0

1⁄4 283 kJ mol

ð18Þ

(cid:1)1

298K

PHowever, this reaction is a highly endothermic reaction, takes
place only at high temperature and is limited by the thermodynamic
equilibrium. To date, some research has been performed to carry out
TDCD using perovskite oxides membrane reactor. In this process,
CO2 was swept to one side of the membrane and the produced O2
permeated to other side of the membrane which then reacted with
CH4 to generate syngas on the other side of membrane.

PFan et al. [247] investigated the TDCD coupled with POM in SrFe-
Co0.5Ox membrane reactor and reported CO2 conversion of 10% at
940 °C. Jin et al. [248] reported 11.1% CO2 conversion, 84.5% CH4 con-
version, 93% CO selectivity and H2/CO ratio of 1.8 at 900 °C in SrCo0.4-
Fe0.5Zr0.1O3-d membrane reactor packed with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in
POM side. Jin et al. [249] also reported an innovative catalytic pro-
cess to decompose CO2 into CO and O2 in the similar SrCo0.4-
Fe0.5Zr0.1O3-d membrane reactor packed with a perovskite oxides
oxide supported noble metal catalyst, or Pt/SrCo0.4Fe0.5Zr0.1O3-d on
which high activity was observed. Furthermore, during the catalytic
process, the activity of the Pt/SrCo0.4Fe0.5Zr0.1O3-d catalyst can be
self-regenerated by removing the produced lattice oxygen through
the dense oxygen permeable ceramic membrane. At 900 °C, this
catalytic process achieved 100% CO selectivity and 15.8% CO2
conversion.

PA 3 wt. % Al2O3-SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d

tubular membrane reactor
packed with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was used for TDCD coupling POM by
Zhang et al. [250]. At 900 °C, the CO2 conversion, CH4 conversion and
CO selectivity reached about 12.4%, 86%, and 93%, respectively (at
H2/CO ratio of 1.8). Compared with the disk-shaped membrane, the
CO2 conversion in the thin tubular membrane is higher at the same
operation temperature. The 3 wt. % Al2O3-SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-d tubular
membrane reactor could also be operated for about 62 h at 900 °C.
The surface modification of the SrCo0.4Fe0.5Zr0.1O3-d membrane was
performed by coating a porous layer to improve the stability of the
membrane reactor [251]. The porous layer material
is SrCo0.4-
Fe0.5Zr0.1O3-d. The results show that the porous layer reduced effi-
ciently the corrosion of gases on the membrane material. Moreover,
the porous layer coating works more effective on the feed side (CO2)
than the permeate side (CH4).

P4.2.3. Coupling reactions with NOx decomposition

PNitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide are major atmospheric pollu-
tants which might contribute to the ozone layer degradation if
released to the atmosphere. During the past decades, substantial
efforts have been devoted to the development of catalytic technolo-
gies to eliminate these oxides, such as non-selective catalytic
(NSCR), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with NH3 or hydrocarbon,
and direct catalytic decomposition of NO:
NO $ 0:5N2 þ O(cid:7)

ð19Þ

N2O $ N2 þ O(cid:7)

ð20Þ

PThe major drawback of NSCR and SCR is the high cost of the
reducing agents. The direct catalytic decomposition of NO or
N2O, on the other hand, suffers from oxygen inhibition. To avoid
inhibition by adsorbed oxygen, the formed O2 formed can be
directly removed from the reaction zone by perovskite oxides
membrane. The decomposition of NO and N2O on the membrane
surface occurs through similar process. First, the adsorbed NO is
catalytically decomposed on the surface of the membrane into
N2 and surface oxygen(O*). The surface oxygen (O*) is then
removed as oxygen ions (O2-) via the perovskite oxides mem-
brane. To ensure a sufficient driving force for the oxygen trans-
port through the membrane, reactants such as methane can be
fed to the permeate side. Jiang et al. [252] demonstrated direct
decomposition of NO coupling with oxidation steam reforming of
methane in a BaCoxFeyZr1-x-yO3-d (BCFZ) hollow fiber membrane.
NO was fed to the core side while methane and H2O were fed to
the shell side of the membrane. The oxidation steam reforming
of methane side was packed with Ni-based catalyst. By in situ
removal of the inhibitor oxygen, NO conversion reached almost
100%, N2 yield reached was around 95% even with co-existing 3%
O2 in the feed at 875 °C.

PThe decomposition of N2O coupling with oxidation steam
reforming of methane was also demonstrated in a BaCoxFeyZr1-x-
yO3-d hollow fiber membrane, which both acts also as the catalyst for
N2O decomposition [240,253]. N2O was fed to the core side while
methane and H2O were fed to the shell side of the membrane. The
results show demonstrate several points, i.e., (1) the addition of
methane to the shell side can greatly improve the N2O decomposi-
tion by removing oxygen in situ; (2) co-feeding oxygen has no nega-
tive effect on the N2O decomposition; and (3) a CH4 conversion in
excess of over 90% and a CO selectivity of 90% was achieved for at
least 60 h in this membrane reactor [253]. N2O decomposition cou-
pled with ODE was studied on BaCoxFeyZr1-x-yO3-d hollow fiber
membrane [240]. N2O was fed to the core side while C2H6 and H2O
were fed to the shell side. According to N2O decomposition equation
and ODE equation, the oxygen generated from N2O decomposition
on the core side was consumed by ethane on the shell side. A

Pcomplete decomposition of N2O, an ethane conversion of 85% and an
ethylene selectivity of 86% were obtained at 850 °C.

5. Conclusions

PThere are numerous research works reported in the literature on
the potential applications of perovskites in oxygen separators, solid
oxide fuel cells, and membrane reactors. Energy scenario analyses
indicate that future technology concepts for clean energy production
could be techno-economically enabled by a low-cost oxygen produc-
tion technology. Apart from the fact that the integrated perovskite
membranes can reduce energy costs in comparison to the conven-
tional oxygen production, the potential of these membranes is not
yet fully developed. Moreover, although the MIEC perovskites can be
a good technological option for membrane-based oxy-fuel plants in
the long future, further improvements in membrane material and
fabrication, process design, and external factors such as CO2 penal-
ties and energy legislation are still crucial to make this promising
technology possible. Likewise, a wide variety of perovskite type
oxides have been developed to achieve higher oxygen reduction
reaction activity or ionic conductivity at lower temperatures, which
is essential towards improved SOFC performance that shows high
reliability and stable operation. There is still a margin to improve the
performance of the potential perovskite materials as well as to
improve the fabrication routes to these materials. The perovskite
membrane reactor technology has the potential of not only integrat-
ing various operations but also providing important benefits in the
process intensification perspective. The critical issue of this technol-
ogy is mainly the stability of the membrane under high operating
temperatures and pressures. The utilization of perovskites in oxygen
separation, solid oxide fuel cells, and membrane reactors is an
emerging discipline; however, there are number of issues that need
to be addressed. Further research and development in material sci-
ence and engineering are required to evolve the perovskite materials
to a stage where their applicability can be widely demonstrated.
