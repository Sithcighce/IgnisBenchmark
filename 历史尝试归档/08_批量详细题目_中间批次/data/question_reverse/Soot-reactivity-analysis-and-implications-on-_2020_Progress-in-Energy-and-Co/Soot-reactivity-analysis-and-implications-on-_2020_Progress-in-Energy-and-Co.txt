Internal  combustion  engines  are  among  the  main  sources  of  soot  particles,  especially  when  non- 
homogeneous and high fuel-air ratio conditions are achieved in the combustion chamber (both diesel 
and direct injection spark ignition engines). Environmental regulations for the road transportation limit 
the number and mass of particles signiﬁcantly, making the use of diesel and gasoline particle ﬁlters -DPF, 
GPF- essential for trapping and burning off, or regenerating, the soot. The tendency of soot to be burnt is 
called oxidative reactivity, which depends on the combined effect of all its properties and characteristics. 
The reactivity of soot particles was considered a detrimental characteristic in the past, prompting atmo- 
spheric reactions that form more harmful pollutants or lubricant oil degradation. However, some bene- 
ﬁcial effects of this characteristic are now acknowledged, such as reducing the number of active ﬁlter 
regeneration events, and thus fuel consumption, driver annoyance and ﬁlter thermal stress. This review 
summarizes the results of soot characterization by applying different analysis techniques. These tech- 
niques have been categorized in structural, chemical and thermal, depending on the type of soot property 
they look into. Structural techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, 
analyze the defects in the graphitic nanostructure, or describe the bulk patterns of the graphitic nanos- 
tructure (X-ray diffraction spectrometry) or the porous microstructure (physisorption or chemisorption). 
Also, microscopic techniques provide valuable information about the visible nano- and microstructure. 
Chemical techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption ﬁne structure spectroscopy, or magnetic 
nuclear resonance describe the chemical oxidizing state, mainly on the soot surface. Other techniques, 
such as thermogravimetry and differential calorimetry directly analyze the thermal or mass response of 
soot under a hot and oxidizing environment. Finally, soot is oxidized in particulate ﬁlters during active 
or passive-active regeneration processes depending on its structural and chemical characteristics. These 
characteristics have been found to be associated with both engine conditions (mainly engine load) and 
type of fuel (with preferential effect of oxygenated fuels). However, it has been demonstrated that differ- 
ent soot characteristics may contribute to opposite trends in reactivity, and therefore, a partial analysis 
of soot characteristics may lead to incorrect conclusions.

1. Introduction 

Particles emitted by road vehicles are formed in the combustion 
chamber when the injected fuel is heated, due to local pyrolytic 
reactions in oxygen-deﬁcient regions of the chamber [1–4] . These 
conditions  are  more  likely  when  combustion  starts  on  a  non- 
homogeneous fuel-air mixture, as in the case of diesel engines or, 
to a lesser extent, in spark ignition direct injection ones. The fuel 
molecules suffer hydrogen abstraction, cycling and growth, leading 
to  the  formation  of  liquid-like  young  soot,  which  then  becomes 
solid mature soot [1–3] . In this growing/maturation process, soot 
is  organized  in  the  form  of  carbon  graphene-like  layers  which 
are  irregularly  superimposed,  forming  units  (primary  particles) 
with nearly spherical shapes [2,3,5] . Primary particles are subject 
to  fast  motion  and  frequent  collisions  within  the  ﬂame  [1–3,5] . 
While  hot  temperature  remains  and  the  local  accessibility  of 
oxygen increases, soot particle growth is compensated by surface 
(or  internal)  oxidation,  and  then  they  stop  growing  and  start  to 
form cluster-shaped agglomerates [1–3] . Nevertheless, most of the 
soot  initially  formed  ﬁnally  disappears  through  oxidation  before 
the ﬂame is extinguished depending on both the reaction kinetics 
and the availability of oxidants and soot precursors [2–4,6] . When 
the remaining agglomerates are expelled from the chamber, they 
may  adsorb  hydrocarbons  on  their  surface.  However,  the  rate  of 
changes  in  their  internal  and  external  carbonaceous  structure 
decreases suddenly, to the point where no signiﬁcant modiﬁcation 
of  their  geometrical  and  structural  characteristics  is  observed 
along the exhaust manifold [1] . 

In modern diesel vehicle engines and recently in direct injection 
spark ignition engines, most soot agglomerates are trapped in par- 
ticulate ﬁlters, usually denoted as DPF for diesel engines and GPF 
for  spark  ignition  engines.  In  contrast,  older  engines  emitted  all 
soot particles to the atmosphere. In the exhaust tube, particles are 
mostly below 500 nm in size and include signiﬁcant number of ul- 
traﬁne particles, i.e. those below 100 nm [7,8] . The particles mainly 
consist of branched agglomerates, which are composed of approx- 
imately  spherical  soot  primary  particles  with  diameters  around 
25 nm [9,10] and inherent densities around 1850 kg/m 3  [2,11,12] , 
and the content of organic compounds (with lower densities and 
usually adsorbed on the soot surface) is rather variable [8] . Since 
soot  agglomerates  have  a  high  light  absorption  eﬃciency  in  the 
visible wavelength range, the emitted particles are generally iden- 
tiﬁed as black carbon by environmentalists and as smoke by engi- 
neers. Depending on their size and aerodynamic shape, it is pos- 
sible that these particles will remain suspended in ambient air for 
such a time that they may undergo regional and intercontinental 
transport, before being ﬁnally deposited to the ground. However, 
the average atmospheric lifetime is estimated at about a week [13] . 
During  the  process  described  above,  soot  agglomerates  can 
react  with  the  surrounding  ambient.  Reactivity  is  a  measure  of 
how  readily  a  substance  undergoes  a  chemical  reaction,  which 
is generally accompanied by a release of energy. One of the ﬁrst 

chances to react takes place after being trapped in the particulate 
ﬁlter. Here, the soot reactivity can be deﬁned as the soot tendency 
to be oxidized at high rate, and it is usually referred to as oxidative 
reactivity. At high exhaust temperature (either as a consequence 
of  high  engine  load  or  because  some  extra  fuel  is  post-injected 
during  an  active  regeneration  process)  [14] ,  soot  particles  may 
or  may  not  be  oxidized  depending  on  their  reactivity.  In  the 
former case, more reactive soot would lead to slower (or even no) 
accumulation  in  the  ﬁlter.  In  the  latter  case,  more  reactive  soot 
would lead to faster ﬁlter regeneration [15,16] . In both cases, high 
soot reactivity has positive consequences in fuel consumption (re- 
duced post-injection period), economic saving (reduced need for 
fuel-borne additives), engine performance (derived from reduced 
exhaust back-pressure), driving annoyance (derived reduced from 
noise) and risk of failure (from ﬁlter wear or ﬁlter cracking due to 
excessive thermal stress if too much soot is accumulated) [14–16] . 
However,  there  are  other  cases  where  high  soot  reactivity  may 
have negative consequences. For example, more reactive soot may 
accelerate  corrosion  of  metal  pieces,  or  may  accelerate  lubricant 
oil  degradation  [17,18] .  Other  negative  consequences  stem  from 
soot particles having been suspended in the atmosphere. Due to 
their reactivity, they may become hydrophilic and act as nuclei for 
water condensation and for the formation of ice and cirrus clouds 
[19] ,  thus  affecting  both  local  weather  and  global  climate  [20] , 
they can contribute to nucleation of sulfuric acid and formation of 
sulfates in the presence of water [21] , or they can serve as a pho- 
tocatalytic support for other atmospheric heterogeneous reactions 
[22] leading to the formation of highly oxidizing species such as 
ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere and to the destruc- 
tion of ozone in the lower stratosphere. Finally, soot particles with 
high reactivity may also have negative effects following inhalation 
or  ingestion  by  living  beings  [23] .  It  has  been  proven  that  in- 
creasing contents of reactive oxygen species in soot particles, such 
as  aromatic  carbonyls  and  dihydrofuran  species,  or  smaller  and 
highly disordered particles, increase redox-cycling activity leading 
to inﬂammation and cellular damage, which may enhance respi- 
ratory, cardiovascular, cancerous and allergic diseases [24–26] . In a 
review by Niessner [27] , the term “biological reactivity of soot” is 
used to encompass these topics. According to Su et al. [28] , defects 
in soot nanostructure play an important role in the toxicity and 
inﬂammatory potential and thus, the biological reactivity of soot. 

The  transport  sector  has  been  one  of  the  main  contributors 
to  soot  particle  emissions,  although  future  expected  trends  in 
transport (electriﬁcation, hybridization) may alter this. Due to the 
harmful effects described above, particle (and other) emissions in 
transport are limited all over the world through emission regula- 
tions, and the limits have become more stringent with time. For 
example, particle mass limits have dropped by more than 95% from 
the early 90s (Euro 1) to 2009 (Euro 5) for light-duty diesel vehi- 
cles in Europe. Car manufacturers have widely introduced particle 
ﬁlters  in  their  vehicles  to  comply  with  this  limit,  but  now  con- 
cern has moved towards particle number, for which the ﬁlters are

not so effective. Particle number limit (6 × 10 11  #/km, consider- 
ing only particles above 23 nm) was ﬁrst introduced in 2011 (Euro 
5b) for diesel cars. Moreover, Euro 6 set the same limit for gasoline 
and diesel cars, since new GDI vehicles are known to emit substan- 
tial numbers of particles. This narrows the emissions gap between 
diesel and gasoline vehicles, in line with US standards. Future regu- 
lations will decrease the lower size limit for particle number mea- 
surement, and will establish new certiﬁcation procedures, more re- 
alistic, that will make even more diﬃcult to fulﬁll the limits. 

Soot  reactivity  depends  on  the  chemical  composition  of  soot 
(mainly surface composition), on the microscopic morphology (i.e. 
the  shape  of  the  agglomerate  and  its  cluster-type  arrangement) 
and on the internal nanostructure. All these parameters can change 
with the operation conditions and the fuel used, as it is reviewed 
in the present work. Of special relevance is the effect of biofuels, 
which  are  being  promoted  mainly  because  of  their  renewable 
character. Most biofuels have been found to reduce particle mass 
and  number  (although  the  magnitude  is  variable  depending  on 
the type of biofuel [29] , their oxygen content or the presence of 
contaminants  [30] ).  Lower  soot  emission  implies  evident  bene- 
ﬁts  in  the  performance  of  both  GPFs  and  DPFs  [31] ,  through  a 
reduced pressure drop and fewer active regeneration events, but 
a  complete  analysis  must  consider  the  reactivity  of  the  trapped 
soot, since reactivity modulates the soot oxidation process in the 
ﬁlters. 

Techniques used to assess soot reactivity examine the chemical 
composition on the soot surface (Fourier transform infrared spec- 
troscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spec- 
troscopy, Near-edge X-ray absorption ﬁne structure spectroscopy, 
magnetic  nuclear  resonance,  etc.),  the  defects  in  the  graphitic 
nanostructure (Raman spectroscopy and Electron energy loss spec- 
troscopy) the bulk patterns of the graphitic nanostructure (X-ray 
diffraction spectrometry), the porous microstructure (physisorption 
or chemisorption), the visible nano- (high resolution transmission 
electron  microscopy,  HRTEM)  or  microstructure  (transmission 
electron microscopy, TEM, or scanning electron microscopy, SEM), 
or directly analyze the thermal or mass response of soot under a 
hot and oxidizing environment (thermogravimetry and differential 
calorimetry). Some of these techniques use graphite as a reference 
because  it  is  a  structurally  well-ordered,  chemically  pure  and 
very inert material. Among the listed techniques, those measuring 
chemical  composition  or  graphitic  structure  contribute  to  chem- 
ical,  structural  or  morphological  arguments,  while  those  based 
on  thermal  analysis  combine  all  these  arguments  and  provide 
a  comprehensive  reactivity  result.  Finally,  a  practical  approach 
consists in observing soot reactivity in the actual reactor or in a 
physical model as close as possible to the actual reactor. In this 
review, the main practical interest is focused on particulate ﬁlters, 
and  therefore,  a  ﬁnal  section  is  devoted  to  experiences  on  ﬁlter 
regeneration.  Many  techniques  with  very  different  principles  are 
available to characterize soot, and the ﬁnal choice will inevitably 
depend  not  only  on  the  soot  characteristics  to  be  studied,  but 
also on the technique accessibility, cost, test time and uncertainty 
of  the  results.  For  instance,  thermogravimetric  analyzers  and 
porosimeters are quite simple and accessible in most labs, and the 
tests  are  inexpensive,  but  they  can  be  time-intensive  depending 
of the experimental parameters. In contrast, transmission electron 
microscopes  or  Raman  spectrometers  are  expensive  instruments 
and the tests must be performed by experienced users. 

In  the  last  decade,  current  trends  in  the  automobile  sector, 
such  as  the  extensive  use  of  particle  ﬁlters  in  automobiles  and 
a  wider  array  of  fuels,  have  given  rise  to  a  body  of  works  that 
analyzes  a  limited  number  of  soot  properties,  with  occasion- 
ally  contradictory  results.  Most  of  this  work  rarely  examines  all 
properties  involved  in  soot  reactivity  together  with  validation 
tests, since only full-equipped leading laboratories could afford it. 

Therefore,  a  review  manuscript  is  now  necessary  for  building  a 
picture  of  soot  properties  (with  emphasis  on  real  soot  samples) 
and analytical techniques that better  explain soot reactivity, and 
for discussing the relationship between the soot reactivity and the 
thermal processes that occur in particle ﬁlters. 

This manuscript is organized into sections, where each section 
is devoted to the results of soot analysis from one technique or a 
group of techniques. All sections have a common structure, with 
a  brief  description  of  the  techniques  and  their  fundamentals  at 
the  beginning,  followed  by  a  discussion  on  the  effect  of  i)  the 
operation  mode,  ii)  the  working  parameters  and  iii)  the  type  of 
fuel on the oxidative reactivity of the soot. Hereinafter, the term 
“operation  mode” refers  to  the  combination  of  engine  load  and 
speed, whereas “working parameters” includes the injection con- 
ditions (timing, strategy and pressure) and the EGR rate. Studies 
that analyze real soot collected from engines/vehicles have been 
prioritized  over  studies  involving  commercial  soot  surrogates, 
such as Printex-U, Degussa or Regal 600. There are other previous 
reviews on the topic [32] that provide the reader with a profound 
insight  on  the  fundamentals  of  the  analytical  techniques  and 
on  the  results  with  soot  surrogates  (Printex-U,  mainly).  When 
necessary,  results  from  these  surrogates  are  included  and  these 
analyses are clearly indicated in the text. 

2. Techniques for structural characterization 

The techniques in this section have been widely used to study 
different  characteristics  related  to  soot  nanostructure  and  mor- 
phology.  Not  all  the  techniques  described  in  this  section  have 
been used to the same extent to analyze diesel soot: while X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron 
microscopy  (TEM)  are  highly  relevant  for  soot  analysis,  other 
techniques, such as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and 
surface area analysis, have been less conclusive. 

Most  of  the  techniques  in  this  group  are  powerful  tools  for 
nano- and micro-structural assessment of soot, and unique in their 
ability to quantify the resemblance of the soot structure to that of 
graphite, which is used as a reference for its low oxidative reac- 
tivity. However, researchers must deal with some issues that may 
impede  consistent  results.  Experienced  technicians  are  needed 
to  run  the  tests  and  select  adequate  operating  parameters  for 
soot analysis, which usually differ from those used by default for 
other substances. Additionally, most techniques use beams focused 
locally on the soot sample; therefore, results should be based on 
an average of a wide number of measurements at different sam ple 
locations. A previous examination of each measurement is required 
to remove from the analysis those that could be interfered with 
impurities. Finally, after each test, the spectra (Raman, XRD) or the 
image (TEM) obtained by the equipment must be depurated and 
treated to derive the targeted soot properties. This process involves 
ﬁtting data with a number of statistical distributions or algorithms 
for image analysis, which introduce uncertainties in the results. 

2.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) 

X-ray  diffraction  provides  information  about  soot  crystallinity 
through  diffraction  patterns  produced  from  the  interaction  be- 
tween X rays and the soot sample. As can be seen in Fig. 1 a) and 
b), a typical soot diffraction pattern results in a large background 
intensity, due to the amorphous carbon in the soot, and two bands. 
The  ﬁrst  band  is  located  at  a  diffraction  angle  around  2 θ = 25 °, 
and  the  second  band  at  2 θ = 43 °.  Besides  these  bands,  an  addi- 
tional small band, named γ in some literature, was detected at a 
diffraction angle of 2 θ = 19 ° in several studies [16,33] . This band 
has been associated either with the presence of amorphous carbon 
connecting the edges of contiguous crystallites [34,35] or with the

subsequent buckling and exfoliation of carbon layers [35] . In some 
studies  about  soot  nanostructure,  the  diffraction  patterns  have 
been  deconvoluted  using  Gaussian  [36–39]  or  pseudo  – Voigt 
[16,33,40–43]  functions,  though  other  studies  [18,44–47]  do  not 
specify  the  deconvolution  method.  From  the  diffraction  patterns 
(height  and  sharpness  of  the  peaks)  and  using  Bragg’s  law  ( Eq. 
(1 ))  and  Scherrer  equations  ( Eqs.  (2 )  and  (3 )),  X–ray  diffraction 
provides  information  about  the  interplanar  distance  between

the  crystallites  ( L c  and  L a ,  respectively).  These  parameters  are 
shown in Fig. 1 c) for a purely graphitic lattice, although such an

To study soot nanostructure, the parameters obtained with XRD 
( d 002 ,  L a  and  L c )  are  traditionally  compared  with  those  obtained 
in the study of graphite [49] , which is used as a reference due to 
its well-ordered nanostructure. In other works [27,50] , researchers 
used a different technique, based on electrical conductivity mea- 
surements,  to  study  the  degree  of  order  of  soot  nanostructure. 
Since  graphite  has  a  high  conductivity,  measuring  this  property 
in  soot  samples  may  provide  an  indication  of  the  degree  of 
graphitization. 

Different studies establish relationships between these param- 
eters ( d 002 , L a  and L c ) and soot reactivity. According to Belenkov 
[49] ,  the  interplanar  distance  between  graphene  layers,  d 002 ,  is 
related to the binding energy of the planes. As d 002 increases, the 
binding energy of the planes decreases, thus these planes are less 
stable and more vulnerable to oxidant attack [49,51] . In addition, 
the  crystallite  length,  L a ,  could  also  be  related  to  reactivity.  Ac- 
cording to Al-Qurashi and Boehman [51] , as the stacking thickness 
of  the  crystallites  increases,  the  density  of  carbon  atoms  at  the 
edge  of  the  graphene  layers  decreases,  resulting  in  a  decrease 
in  reactivity.  These  carbon  atoms  at  the  borders  of  the  layers 
are 100–1000 times more reactive than those in the basal plane, 
because they have higher aﬃnity to form bonds with chemisorbed 
oxygen, due to the availability of unpaired sp 2  electrons. Finally, 
higher values of L c are characteristic of a more graphitic, and thus 
less reactive [51] , structure. 

Different researchers have evaluated engine load effects on soot 
nanostructure. Ruiz et al. [41] generated soot in two steady con- 
ditions (43 Nm and 95 Nm, both at 2410 rpm) in a direct injection 
automotive diesel engine performing a dual fuel combustion with 
n -butanol or ethanol. Three steady operation points were selected 
by Lapuerta et al. [16] to generate soot (1667 rpm 78 Nm, 1972 rpm 
95 Nm  and  2276 rpm  164 Nm)  in  a  Euro  5  engine  running  with 
diesel and an animal fat biodiesel. In both studies, the researchers 
observed  that  the  interplanar  distance  between  graphene  layers 
becomes  smaller  as  engine  load  increases.  The  same  trend  as 
[41]  was  observed  by  Song  et  al.  [52]  who  generated  soot  in 
two steady conditions (1800 rpm 25 % and 75 % of peak load) to 
evaluate the effect of a fuel-borne catalyst on soot characteristics. 
Although  these  authors  did  not  analyze  the  results  in  depth,  an 
exhaustive examination of the diffraction patterns obtained in this 
study shows that band 002 is displaced towards higher 2 θ diffrac- 
tion  angles  for  soot  generated  at  high  load  condition.  Regarding 
the  effect  of  engine  load  on  the  graphitic  crystallite  parameters 
( L a and L c ) trends found in the different studies are contradictory. 
While Ruiz et al. [41] observed that engine load has no effect on 
these  parameters,  Braun  et  al.  [38] ,  who  generated  soot  at  two 
load conditions (ﬁxing speed and varying torque) in a two-cylinder 
engine, observed that L a and L c increased as engine load was in- 
creased.  On  the  other  hand,  Lapuerta  et  al.  [38]  analyzed  the 
crystallite parameters from diesel soot, and found trends similar 
to  those  obtained  in  [41] ,  while  the  crystallite  parameters  from 
biodiesel soot followed similar trends to those obtained in [38] . 

According to the results described above, it seems that as the 
engine load increases (higher soot formation temperatures), soot 
nanostructure  becomes  more  ordered  (lower  d 002  and  higher  L c 
and  L a ),  meaning  that  soot  nanostructure  becomes  increasingly 
similar  to  that  of  graphite.  These  results  are  in  line  with  the 
conceptual  model  proposed  by  Griﬃth  and  Marsh  [53] ,  which 
shows  that  more  ordered  graphene  layers  are  formed  at  higher 
combustion  temperatures.  This  agrees  with  the  results  reported 

by Alexandrino et al. [54] , who found that soot samples formed 
at higher temperature featured more ordered structures (XRD and 
Raman spectroscopy results) and were more reactive towards both 
oxygen and nitrogen monoxide. 

Studies  with  soot  collected  from  aircraft  engines  show  that 
the  nanostructure  is  quite  similar  to  that  described  so  far,  with 
an  onion-like  arrangement  of  concentric  graphitic  layers  of  dif- 
ferent  lengths.  However,  the  effect  of  the  engine  load  on  the 
soot  nanostructure  is  less  clear,  possibly  because  combustion  is 
controlled  differently  compared  to  diesel  engines.  Parent  et  al. 
[55]  analyzed  the  effect  of  engine  load  on  the  nanostructure 
of  soot  collected  at  the  exhaust  of  a  turbofan  engine.  Although 
the  interplanar  distance  was  similar  to  those  obtained  in  diesel 
engines, no signiﬁcant effect of the engine load on this parameter 
was observed. The same conclusion was reached in [56,57] after 
analyzing soot collected from different aircraft turbine engines at 
different operating speeds and thrusts. 

To date, there are not many studies relating the effect of engine 
parameters modiﬁcation on soot nanostructure. Ye et al. [58] gen- 
erated soot in a common-rail turbocharged direct injection diesel 
engine to evaluate the effect of injection pressure on soot charac- 
teristics. In this study, no relationship was found between crystal- 
lite parameters and injection pressure. On the other hand, Yehliu 
et al. [59] investigated the injection strategy effect on soot prop- 
erties. In this study, soot was generated in a 2.5 L direct injection 
light-duty diesel engine and, as in the previous study, no effect of 
the injection strategy on the soot nanostructure was found. Both 
Rohani and Bae [36] and Al-Qurashi and Boehman [51] analyzed 
the effect of the EGR ratio on the dimension of the crystallites. In 
general, they observed that EGR led to soot samples with lower 
crystallite parameters ( L a  and L c ), although the effect on the dis- 
tance between graphitic layers ( d 002 ) was different in both works. 
The effect of fuel on soot nanostructure has been widely stud- 
ied.  Speciﬁcally,  numerous  investigations  have  studied  biodiesel 
soot  nanostructure.  Soriano  et  al.  [40]  observed  that  soot  from 
neat biodiesel (72% soybean 28% palm oil) has lower interplanar 
distance  between  graphene  layers  and  larger  crystallite  dimen- 
sions ( L a  and L c ) than diesel soot. Similar results were observed 
by  Lapuerta  et  al.  [16] ,  but  in  the  case  of  L a  and  L c  this  effect 
was  only  observed  at  high  load.  Bhardwaj  et  al.  [60]  reported 
analogous results too, but in this case, soot from biodiesel (RME) 
presented higher stacking thickness of the crystallites than diesel 
soot. On the other hand, Yehliu et al. [59] observed opposite trend 
to [16,40] , with soot from a pure soybean methyl ester, presenting 
lower  L c  and  L a  than  diesel  soot.  In  other  studies  [45,58]  soot 
generated from diesel–biodiesel blends (80% diesel -20% soybean 
oil in both cases) was observed to possess shorter crystallites ( L a ) 
in general, than soot generated from diesel fuel. 

The nanostructure of soot generated from different oxygenated 
fuels  has  been  analyzed  as  well.  While  Gogoi  et  al.  [37]  evalu- 
ated the effect of an oxygenated additive (2,5-dimethylfuran) on 
soot  nanostructure,  Ruiz  et  al.  [41]  studied  the  effect  of  diesel 
combustion with ethanol or butanol (both injected in the intake 
manifold). Finally, Agudelo et al. [33] analyzed soot nanostructure 
from crude vegetable oils, which showed higher stacking thickness 
and length of the crystallites than diesel soot. This result does not 
agree  with  those  obtained  in  [37,41] ,  where  soot  nanostructure 
was unaffected by the presence of oxygen. The different content 
of  oxygen  and  the  different  nature  of  these  biofuels  may  be 
responsible for these discrepancies. 

Regarding  soot  generated  from  paraﬃnic  fuels,  the  re- 
sults  shown  in  the  literature  are  contradictory.  While  in 
[40,44,59,60]  soot  generated  from  paraﬃnic  fuels  (Gas-to-Liquid 
fuels  derived  from  natural  gas  through  Fischer  Tropsch  process 
-GTL- or hydrotreated vegetable oils -HVO) showed higher L a than 
diesel  soot,  in  [40,45]  the  trend  was  just  the  opposite.  Most  of 

6 

M. Lapuerta, J. Rodríguez–Fernández and J. Sánchez-Valdepeñas / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100833 

these  investigations  did  not  show  error  bars  or  other  statistical 
parameters  showing  whether  the  differences  observed  in  the 
results were signiﬁcant or not. For this reason, the effect of the 
paraﬃnic  fuels  on  soot  nanostructure  is  diﬃcult  to  assess.  In  a 
more  fundamental  investigation,  Wei  et  al.  [46]  generated  soot 
with  two  different  fuels  (n-heptane  and  a  blend  of  toluene  and 
n-heptane). In this study, soot generated from the paraﬃnic fuel 
(n-heptane) showed higher L a  than soot generated from the fuel 
containing  aromatic  compounds  (toluene  and  n-heptane  blend). 
According  to  these  results,  though  not  mentioned  explicitly,  it 
seems that the presence of aromatic compounds in the fuel favors 
the formation of soot with a more disordered nanostructure than 
soot generated from fuel without aromatics. 

According to the results shown in this section, it can be con- 
cluded  that  the  engine  load,  the  engine  parameters  or  the  type 
of fuel used have not been shown to have unique effects on soot 
nanostructure. For this reason, other analytical techniques must be 
used in complement to assess the effect of these parameters on 
soot nanostructure. 

A similar technique to XRD is SAXS (Small Angle X-Ray Scat- 
tering), which has been widely used to analyze the microstructure 
of  biomolecules  [61] .  This  technique  has  been  used  in  a  few 
studies to  characterize size, shape and fractal dimension of  soot 
agglomerates [38,62] . The main difference between XRD and SAXS 
is the angular range scanned by the monochromatic beam. While 
in  XRD  the  scanned  angular  interval  ranges  from  approximately 
5–70 °, in SAXS the upper end of the range is around 5 °, and the 
lower  end  of  the  range  approaches  tenth  of  a  degree.  Another 
difference between XRD and SAXS is the way in which the results 
are presented. In a typical XRD diffractogram, intensity is plotted 
versus the diffraction degree, whereas in a SAXS diffractogram, the 
intensity is plotted versus the scattering vector ( q ). By ﬁtting the 
diffractograms obtained with SAXS, it is possible obtain informa- 
tion about soot nanostructure using Guinier and Porod equations.

Few studies have been published using SAXS to perform anal- 
ysis on soot from internal combustion engines, but this technique 
has been used successfully in studies about diffusion ﬂames [63] . 
Regarding  engine  soot,  work  by  Braun  et  al.  [38,64]  should  be 
highlighted. In these studies, soot was generated in two different 
load  conditions  (idle  on  one  side,  and  1200 rpm,  13 Nm  on  the 
other  side).  In  this  work,  agglomerates  from  soot  generated  at 
higher  load  conditions  presented  higher  fractal  dimension  and 
lower size. Although, these results (fractal dimension and agglom- 
erate size) can be obtained using transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM), the main advantage of SAXS compared to TEM is the faster 
analysis and processing of the results. 

2.2. Raman spectroscopy 

Raman spectroscopy is a technique widely used to characterize 
the internal structure of carbonaceous substances, including diesel 
soot.  This  technique  analyzes  the  light  scattered  by  the  sample 
upon irradiation with a monochromatic beam. The majority of the 
scattered radiation presents the same wavelength as the incident 
one, but a small fraction of the scattered radiation has a different 
wavelength (Raman scattering). This scattered radiation, with dif- 
ferent wavelength, provides information about soot nanostructure 
[65] .  In  contrast  to  XRD,  this  information  is  not  only  related  to 
the  crystalline  portion,  but  also  to  the  amorphous  carbon  [32] . 
Regarding carbonaceous materials, Raman spectroscopy has been 
traditionally used to analyze coal, and for this reason, most of the 
literature discusses the most appropriate parameter values for coal 
analysis  (laser  wavelength,  laser  intensity  and  sample  exposure 

time). The number of publications in which diesel soot is analyzed 
with  this  technique  is  much  lower  than  the  number  of  studies 
focusing on coal. In this ﬁeld, it is therefore necessary to highlight 
the study by Sadezky et al. [66] and Lapuerta et al. [67] , in which 
parameter values are proposed to obtain the most accurate results 
when analyzing diesel soot. 

Raman  spectroscopy,  when  applied  to  diesel  soot,  has  been 
used to study the degree of order of soot nanostructure compared 
to graphite nanostructure. In Fig. 1 a) a typical spectrum obtained 
when analyzing soot with Raman spectroscopy is shown. Though 
a bit arbitrary, deconvoluting this spectrum has been proven to be 
helpful for facilitating the work. Traditionally the method devel- 
oped by Sadezky et al. [66] is used for deconvolution. This method 
uses four Lorentzian functions ( G, D 1 , D 2  and D 4  bands) and one 
Gaussian function ( D 3 band) to ﬁt the soot spectrum. The D 1 band 
is  the  most  intense  band  and  it  is  related  to  the  nanostructure 
disorder  due  to  vacancies  or  crystalline  defects  [66,67] .  There  is 
some  disagreement  about  the  meaning  of  D 2  band.  According 
to  Jawhari  et  al.  [68]  this  band  is  related  to  a  lattice  mode  in 
graphitic crystallites when some disorder is introduced, but Parent 
et  al.  [55]  explained  that  the  D 2  band  corresponds  to  lattice 
vibrations,  similar  to  that  of  the  G  band  but  involving  isolated 
layers.  Nevertheless,  the  D 2  band  has  been  rarely  considered  in 
soot.  The  D 3  band  is  associated  with  amorphous  carbon  which 
derives from organic molecules or functional groups. D 4  band is 
related to carbon–carbon bonds, such as those of ionic impurities 
or polyene-like structures [69] . Finally, the G band is characteristic 
of the graphitic structure, as shown in Fig. 1 b), which represents 
a typical spectrum obtained when analyzing graphite. Other work 
from  Patel  et  al.  [47]  and  Lapuerta  et  al.  [67]  used  a  different 
version  of  the  method  proposed  by  Sadezky  et  al.  [66] .  While 
Patel  et  al.  [47]  discarded  the  D 2  and  D 4  bands,  Lapuerta  et  al. 
[67] discarded the D 2 band only, because this band is not usually 
observed in the Raman spectra of diesel soot. 

In Raman spectroscopy, the ratio between the different D bands 
Di / I G ,  i = 1,  2,  3,  4)  and  the  ratio 
and  the  G  band  intensities  ( I 
Di / A G ,  i = 1,  2,  3,  4)  have  been  related  to 
between  their  areas  ( A 
the presence of defects in the basal plane of the graphene layers 
that  form  diesel  soot  [41,66,67] .  In  addition,  other  authors  have 
related  the  width  of  the  different  bands,  quantiﬁed  through  the 
FWHM  (full  width  at  half  maximum),  with  the  defects  on  soot 
nanostructure. However, there is no general agreement regarding 
which  of  these  parameters  is  most  signiﬁcant,  although  it  is 
clear that not all of them need to be used, since they cannot be 
considered as independent variables. Some authors [70–72] have 
proposed different  correlations  to  link  the  results  obtained from 
Raman spectroscopy (ratio I D1 / I G , speciﬁcally) with the length of 
the  crystallites  ( L a )  obtained  with  XRD.  Furthermore,  Zhu  et  al. 
[73] estimated the interplanar distance ( d 002 ) from the correlation 
proposed  in  [70]  and  the  graphite  atomic  model  [49] .  Finally, 
Casiraghi et al. [74] proposed a correlation to calculate the hydro- 
gen content in the soot sample from the spectrum obtained using 
Raman spectroscopy. 

Different  authors  have  used  Raman  spectroscopy  to  assess 
the effect of engine load, engine parameters and/or fuel on soot 
nanostructure.  In  all  the  studies  consulted  [16,41,53,58,75,76] , 
no  effect  of  engine  load  was  observed  on  soot  nanostructure, 
neither when evaluated from the I D1 / I G ratio nor from the A D1 / A G 
ratio. In premixed ﬂames, some research groups [77] also found 
that  combustion  temperature  affected  the  dehydrogenation  and 
aromatization processes of soot, but did not signiﬁcantly change 
the ﬁnal nanostructural characteristics (in the temperature range 
160 0-170 0 K). However, although it was not mentioned explicitly, 
in the results from Lapuerta et al. [16] , Parent et al. [55] , Ye et al. 
[58]  and  Yehliu  et  al.  [75] ,  it  can  generally  be  observed  that  as 
the  load  engine  increases,  the  nanostructural  degree  of  order 

M. Lapuerta, J. Rodríguez–Fernández and J. Sánchez-Valdepeñas / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100833 

7 

increases,  i.e.,  ratio  I D1 /I G  decreases.  Although  the  differences 
cannot  be  considered  signiﬁcant,  these  trends  agree  with  the 
conceptual model of Marsh and Griﬃths [53] , mentioned above. 

Regarding the effect of the injection parameters, Yehliu et al. 
[75]  compared  a  conventional  combustion  mode  and  an  HECC 
(high-eﬃciency  clean  combustion)  mode,  the  latter  consisting  of 
an advanced injection and high EGR ratio. The HECC mode resulted 
in a more disorganized soot nanostructure than the conventional 
mode.  In  addition,  Ye  et  al.  [58] ,  Mühlbauer  et  al.  [78]  and  Ess 
et al. [79] studied the effect of injection pressure. In the study of 
Mühlbauer et al. [78] , in which soot was generated in a light-duty 
diesel engine that complies with Euro 5 standard, the effects of 
three different injection pressures (300 bar, 620 bar and 10 0 0 bar) 
were assessed. Results showed that increasing injection pressure 
from  300  bar  to  620  bar  had  no  effect  on  I D1 / I G  ratio,  but  the 
soot  generated  with  an  injection  pressure  of  10 0 0  bar  showed 
a  lower  I D1 / I G  ratio,  i.e.,  a  structure  with  less  defects  than  the 
other  soots.  However,  Ye  et  al.  [58]  and  Ess  et  al.  [79]  did  not 
observe  any  effect  of  injection  pressure  on  soot  nanostructure. 
Results obtained in these studies suggest the existence of similar 
carbon  structures  for  soot  generated  at  different  injection  pres- 
sures.  The  discrepancies  between  the  study  of  Mühlbauer  et  al. 
[78] and the study of Ye et al. [58] may be attributed to the type 
of engine: while the former used a light duty diesel engine, the 
latter used a heavy-duty engine. The differences between results 
from Mühlbauer et al. [62] and Ess et al. [63] are more complex 
to explain, since both investigations were carried out in the same 
research  group  and  with  the  same  engine  running  in  the  same 
operation  modes.  Finally,  the  effect  of  boost  pressure  on  soot 
nanostructure  was  studied  in  the  investigations  by  Mühlbauer 
et al. [78] and Ess et al. [79] , leading to no signiﬁcant effect. 

The effect of EGR rate on soot nanostructure was assessed in 
different  studies  [36,51] .  Rohanni  et  al.  [36]  observed  that  soot 
generated  with  and  without  EGR  had  similar  nanostructure,  i.e., 
similar I D1 / I G and A D1 / A G ratios. These results are partially in line 
with those obtained in the investigation of Al-Qurashi et al. [51] , 
who observed that as the oxidation process progressed, the nanos- 
tructure of soot generated with and without EGR remained similar. 
In this last work [51] , at the initial stage of the oxidation process 
(0%  burn-off),  soot  generated  under  high  EGR  ratio  presented  a 
more disordered nanostructure than the other soot. Nevertheless, 
both  studies  [36,51]  limited  the  explored  EGR  range  to  values 
lower than 25%. Thus, it is not possible to assess the effect of EGR 
at higher ratios, which are typical in current combustion modes. 

Finally, the effect of fuel has been evaluated in different studies. 
Most  of  the  investigations  consulted  focus  on  comparing  diesel 
and biodiesel soots [16,40,45,67,80,81,82] . The most common trend 
observed is that biodiesel soot has a more ordered nanostructure 
than diesel soot. The studies consulted usually used I D1 / I G ratio to 
study  soot  nanostructure  [16,40,67,82] ,  but  others  used  the  I D / I G 
ratio [45,80,81] . Results obtained in these investigations revealed 
that  biodiesel  soot  present  ratios  ( I D1 / I G  or  I D / I G )  approximately 
5–20% lower than those for diesel soot. However, results obtained 
in some of these studies cannot be considered signiﬁcant [40,81] , 
since  the  error  bars  overlap.  Intramolecular  oxygen  in  biodiesel 
could be the reason for this behavior, due to its role in the oxi- 
dation process of the graphitic layers. In this process, the oxidant 
agents from the exhaust gases attack the active sites present in the 
structural defects. This favors the removal of structural defects and 
the formation of more ordered graphitic layers. Although it seems 
clear that biodiesel soot has a more ordered nanostructure than 
diesel  soot,  according  to  Raman  spectroscopy  results,  often  the 
opposite trend is observed when diesel-biodiesel blends are used 
[45,58,80,83] . Although some of these results may not be consid- 
ered signiﬁcant (with error bars overlapping) [45,58] , they could 
be explained by the fact that when oxygen concentration is not 

high enough, soot oxidation is not as favored as soot formation. 
Biodiesel has a much wider hydrocarbon segment (C16–C18) than 
diesel fuel, and therefore larger PAH molecules are more likely to 
be produced during pyrolysis process. The formation of heavy PAH 
leads  to  a  disordered  structure  through  coalescence  and  growth 
mechanisms [83] . 

The  effect  of  paraﬃnic  fuels  (Fischer  Tropsch  fuels,  mainly) 
on  soot  nanostructure  has  also  been  evaluated  in  a  few  studies 
[40,42,45,80] .  In  this  work,  soot  generated  from  paraﬃnic  fuels 
and diesel fuels showed very similar structures. These results are 
not in line with those obtained in the investigation by Wei et al. 
[46] , who observed that the presence of aromatic compounds in 
the  fuel  leads  to  the  formation  of  soot  with  a  more  disordered 
structure compared to soot generated from fuels free of aromatics. 
In addition, Agudelo et al. [33] evaluated the nanostructure soot 
generated  from  different  crude  vegetable  oils.  Results  obtained 
show that i) soot from crude vegetable oils has a more ordered 
structure  than  diesel  soot  and  ii)  the  G  band  of  soot  samples 
from  vegetable  oils  was  shifted  towards  higher  wavenumber  in 
comparison  to  diesel  soot.  Nanostructure  of  soot  generated  in 
dual-fuel  combustion  processes  have  been  assessed  too.  In  the 
study of Mustaﬁ et al. [76] soot was generated from a dual-fuel 
combustion of diesel and natural gas or biogas, while in the study 
of  Nithyanandan  et  al.  [84]  soot  was  generated  from  diesel  and 
compressed natural gas. In these studies, soot generated from dual 
fuel  combustion  presented  a  more  ordered  nanostructure  than 
diesel  soot.  Furthermore,  Ruiz  et  al.  [41]  evaluated  the  effect  of 
dual-fuel combustion with n-butanol or ethanol. These authors ob- 
served that the dual-fuel combustion process did not signiﬁcantly 
modify the soot nanostructure compared to diesel fuel. 

2.3. Electron microscopy 

Electron microscopy is an imaging technique that allows both 
high magniﬁcation and resolution, enough to reveal detailed mor- 
phological features of the examined particles down to micro- and 
nanoscales.  Overlapping  of  several  soot  agglomerates  should  be 
avoided for precise deﬁnition of the agglomerate and its contour. 
The best results are obtained when the soot sample is collected on 
grids immersed in the exhaust stream for a short time (less than 
one  second).  Methods  based  on  inertial  impaction  may  collect 
preferentially  larger  particles,  leading  to  parameter  values  that 
do not represent the soot agglomerate population. Thus, methods 
based  on  soot  thermophoresis  are  preferred.  These  images,  ob- 
tained with different microscopes such as SEM (scanning electron 
microscopy)  or  TEM  (transmission  electron  microscopy),  can  be 
processed with different softwares to obtain additional information 
about the morphology of the soot sample. Most of the consulted 
studies  used  TEM  instead  of  SEM  to  analyze  soot  morphology 
[85,86] , due to the higher resolution achievable with the former 
with respect to the latter, and because it has better potential to 
analyze  individual  agglomerates.  For  this  reason,  only  studies  in 
which soot was analyzed with TEM are presented in this review. 
Among  the  studies  using  TEM,  much  of  the  reviewed  literature 
used images obtained with HRTEM (high-resolution transmission 
electron microscope) to analyze the soot internal nanostructure. 

2.3.1. Transmission electron microscopy 

From  the  images  obtained  with  TEM,  a  number  of  different 
parameters are used to describe soot morphology, such as primary 
particle diameter ( d p 0 ), projected area of the agglomerate ( A p ) and 
radius  of  gyration  ( R g ).  In  some  studies,  however,  the  radius  of 
the  circumscribed  circle  is  used  instead.  Additionally,  other  pa- 
rameters such as fractal dimension ( D 
f ), primary particle number 
f ) can be further obtained from the power- 
( n p 0 ) and prefactor ( k 
law  relationship  ( Eq.  (5 )).  To  solve  this  equation,  an  additional 

8

power-law relationship ( Eq. (6 )) must be used, since the primary 
particle number cannot be obtained from the TEM images. Eq. (6 ) 
quantiﬁes,  statistically,  the  volume  (i.e.,  the  number  of  primary 
particles assuming uniform  projected  area ( A p 0 )  for  all of  them) 
which  is  hidden  behind  the  projected  area  of  the  agglomerate. 
This quantiﬁcation is made with the overlapping exponent ( z ).

The value of the overlapping exponent ( z ) is a source of great 
controversy  among  the  different  investigators.  Medalia  et  al. 
[87]  proposed  a  value  of  1.15  for  this  exponent,  while  other 
authors  [88]  [89]  proposed  a  value  of  1.09.  Oh  and  Sorensen 
[90] ,  using  a  software  to  generate  agglomerates,  proposed  an 
overlapping exponent of 1.10. In a recent study, Martos et al. [91] , 
using  different  software  for  random  generation  of  agglomerates, 
and  analyzing  15500  images,  obtained  an  average  value  for  the 
overlapping factor of 1.13. Some authors have also proposed vari- 
able values of the overlapping exponent depending on the number 
of primary particles, or the fractal dimension, or both. Kandilian 
et  al.  [92]  proposed  an  equation  to  estimate  the  overlapping 
exponent as function of the fractal dimension. Lapuerta et al. [93] , 
proposed an iterative method to calculate the fractal dimension of 
agglomerates through expressions that connect the prefactor and 
the overlapping exponent with the fractal dimension. This method 
has been improved in further studies [94,95] . 

Primary particle size and agglomerate size can both inﬂuence 
soot  reactivity.  As  these  parameters  decrease,  the  soot  surface 
area  per  unit  volume  increases,  and  the  oxidant  agents  have 
greater  access  to  the  carbonaceous  substrate.  Additionally,  and 
regardless of size, both fractal dimension and prefactor may affect 
soot  reactivity.  These  characteristics  are  related  to  the  degree 
of  soot  packaging,  thus  affecting  soot  oxidation  kinetics.  As  the 
fractal  dimension  decreases,  the  soot  matrix  is  more  prone  to 
oxidation. 

The effect of engine load on soot morphology has been widely 
studied  in  the  literature,  although  the  results  obtained  in  the 
different  studies  are  contradictory.  The  most  accepted  trend  in 
literature is that the engine load has no effect on soot morphology 
[16,41,52,58,96] . According to Ye et al. [58] , this trend can be ex- 
plained by the combined effect of higher fuel-air ratio, which tends 
to extend the primary particle growth, and higher in-cylinder tem- 
perature,  which  promotes  the  oxidation  of  the  primary  particle. 
However, other investigators [73,97–99] found that as the engine 
load  increases,  the  size  of  the  primary  particle  decreases.  This 
result would imply that, at higher engine loads, particle oxidation 
is more sensitive to the high in-cylinder temperature than the par- 
ticle formation rate [97] . Zhu et al. [73] observed that in a lower 
temperature range, the primary particle size increases slightly with 
increasing temperature, indicating that particle growth supersedes 
particle  oxidation.  However,  in  a  higher  temperature  range,  the 
primary  particle  size  decreases  with  temperature.  Finally,  other 
investigators  observed  that  as  the  engine  load  increases,  the 
primary  particle  size  increases  [100,101] ,  although  in  [100]  the 
differences  observed  were  not  signiﬁcant.  Lapuerta  et  al.  [101] , 
explained that at high engine loads, combustion takes place both 
with lower excess oxygen and with higher pressure and tempera- 
ture levels in the combustion chamber. In any case, discrepancies 
may be attributed to differences in engines, operation modes, fuel 
characteristics and image processing procedure. 

Furthermore, some studies have evaluated the effect of engine 
load  over  the  fractal  dimension.  Once  more,  most  of  the  results 

obtained in these investigations are contradictory. Ruiz et al. [41] , 
Ye et al. [58] , Li et al. [99] and Lapuerta et al. [102] found that 
as  the  engine  load  increases,  the  fractal  dimension  increases. 
However,  the  differences  observed  between  the  fractal  dimen- 
sion  of  soot  generated  at  low  load  and  at  high  load  cannot  be 
considered as signiﬁcant in some cases. A similar conclusion was 
reached by Song et al. [52] , who observed no effect of the engine 
load  on  the  fractal  dimension  of  soot  agglomerates.  Finally,  Lu 
et al. [100] observed that as the engine load increases the fractal 
dimension decreases. 

The effect of other engine parameters such as injection timing, 
injection strategy, injection pressure or EGR on soot morphology 
have also been evaluated in the literature, but not to the same ex- 
tent as the effect of engine load or type of fuel. Xu et al. [97] stud- 
ied the effect of injection timing on soot morphology and observed 
that advancing the injection timing leads to a decrease in the av- 
erage primary particle size. Particles generated with an advanced 
injection timing underwent a longer oxidation period than those 
generated with a retarded injection timing and for this reason, ox- 
idative radicals (OH or O) had more time to react with the surface 
of soot particles. In other studies, the effect of injection pressure 
on  soot  morphology  was  evaluated  [78,98,103] .  In  general,  the 
average size of the primary particles decreases with higher fuel in- 
jection pressure. According to Xu et al. [103] , an increase in the in- 
jection pressure leads to an enhanced fuel-air mixing process, thus 
reducing the formation of soot precursors and the rates of particle 
inception and growth. Furthermore, as the injection pressure in- 
creases, the maximum adiabatic ﬂame temperature increases too. 
This favors the presence of different oxidative radicals that increase 
the oxidation rate. In contrast, Ye et al. [58] observed that the in- 
jection pressure has a negligible impact on the size of primary par- 
ticles. However, in the same study, the increase in injection pres- 
sure decreased the average fractal dimension by 5%. Finally, the ef- 
fect of EGR was studied in the work of Lapuerta et al. [101] . These 
authors  observed  that  increasing  the  EGR  showed  no  signiﬁcant 
changes in the size of the primary particle. This was attributed to 
the  compromise between  higher  temperature  levels  in  the  com- 
bustion chamber and lower oxygen concentration in the ﬂame. Al- 
Qurashi et al. [51] studied the effect of EGR on the size of primary 
particles during the oxidation process. These authors observed that 
for lower burn-off degrees (up to 50%), the reduction in the size of 
primary particles of both types of soot (generated with and with- 
out EGR) was similar. However, for higher burn-off degrees the re- 
duction of the primary particle size was more pronounced for the 
soot generated without EGR than for the soot generated with EGR. 
As suggested based on HRTEM images at advanced conversion lev- 
els, primary particles of soot generated with EGR undergo an inter- 
nal burning process, which contributes to stabilizing their external 
size. 

Regarding  the  fuel  effect,  different  studies  have  assessed  the 
effect  of  biodiesel  on  the  size  of  primary  particles.  The  general 
trend indicates that the use of biodiesel fuel leads to a particle size 
reduction between 11% - 30% (depending on the operation mode 
at  which  soot  was  generated)  [16,43,44,81,104–106] .  The  main 
reason  for  this  trend  could  be  the  oxygen  content  in  biodiesel 
fuels. Intramolecular oxygen in biodiesel fuels acts as an oxidant 
agent and inhibits the formation of soot precursors, leading to a 
reduction in the size and number of soot particles. Furthermore, 
biodiesel  is  free  of  aromatic  compounds,  species  that  favor  soot 
inception. However, a lesser amount of studies found the opposite 
trend [40,82] , namely that the use of biodiesel leads to an increase 
in the size of the primary particles. According to Salamanca et al. 
[82] ,  the  large  size  of  soot  particles  generated  from  biodiesel  is 
a  consequence  of  incomplete  combustion  of  the  large  molecular 
weight components of biodiesel. Soriano et al. [40] and Ye et al. 
[58] evaluated the effect of biodiesel on the soot morphology, and 

M. Lapuerta, J. Rodríguez–Fernández and J. Sánchez-Valdepeñas / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100833 

9 

found that the fractal dimension of soot generated from biodiesel 
is similar to that obtained with diesel soot. 

Other  authors  have  studied  the  primary  particle  size  of  soot 
generated from paraﬃnic fuels [40,44,80] . Results obtained show 
that primary particles of soot generated from paraﬃnic fuels are 
smaller than those obtained from biodiesel fuel. Finally, Agudelo 
et al. [33] evaluated the effect of two different crude vegetable oils 
on soot morphology and observed that soot from crude vegetable 
oils  had  similar  particle  primary  size  compared  to  diesel  fuel. 
Otherwise,  the  fractal  dimension  of  agglomerates  from  crude 
vegetable oil was slightly lower than that of diesel agglomerates. 

The morphology of soot emitted in dual-fuel combustion pro- 
cesses  has  also  been  studied.  While  dual-fuel  combustion  with 
alcohols resulted in average primary particle sizes similar to those 
of  soot  generated  from  diesel  fuel  only  [41,96] ,  Nithyanandan 
et  al.  [84]  found  that  the  average  size  of  soot  primary  particles 
generated  in  dual-fuel  combustion  processes  with  compressed 
natural gas was larger than that from diesel soot. 

Finally, Wei et al. [46] studied the effect of aromatic compounds 
on the size of primary particles. They observed that soot primary 
particles generated from a fuel with aromatic content were larger 
than those generated from a fuel without aromatic content, com- 
ﬁrming  that  aromatic  compounds  favor  the  formation  of  soot 
precursors and the inception and growth of primary particles. 

A  summary  of  the  results  reviewed  in  this  section  is  shown 
in  Table  1 .  As  observed,  the  average  diameter  of  the  primary 
particles  is  approximately  20–30 nm,  although  in  the  study  of 
Omidvarborna et al. [104] the primary particle size is larger than 
in  the  other  studies.  This  is  probably  due  to  the  fact  that  soot 
was generated in a combustion chamber. Fractal dimension ranges 
between 1.5 and 2.3 in all the investigations consulted. 

2.3.2. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy 

Soot  nanostructure  has  often  been  evaluated  from  images 
obtained with HRTEM. Images must be analyzed in a sequence of 
steps,  which  includes  noise  reduction,  mathematical  algorithms 
and/or  statistical  data  treatment,  that  differ  among  authors  and 
can hinder comparison of the results. For example, Apicella et al. 
[110] compared two image analysis procedures, resulting in differ- 
ent values for the length of the carbon layers and other structural 
parameters.  In  any  case,  images  show  that  soot  particles  are 
formed with more-or-less deformed and incomplete graphene lay- 
ers, which give soot an “onion-like” structure. This structure is far 
from being regular, and shows a more amorphous structure close 
to the particle core, where the graphene layers are settled more ir- 
regularly [111] . The parameters studied are usually the interplanar 
distance  between  graphene  layers,  the  length  of  the  crystallites 
and  the  tortuosity  of  the  layers.  As  explained  in  Section  2.1 , 
both the distance between graphene layers and the length of the 
crystallites could be related to soot reactivity. In [112] , the authors 
suggest that the layer dimensions alter the ratio of edge to basal 
plane sites, with the edge sites being more reactive. Furthermore, 
the tortuosity (i.e. the curvature of the graphene layers) is related 
with the nanostructure degree of order. It is expected that as the 
tortuosity increases (i.e. less nanostructural order), soot reactivity 
increases.  These  soot  characteristics  (distance  between  graphitic 
lattices, length of the crystallites and tortuosity) have been studied 
with different, often custom-built, software, as was developed by 
Vander Wal et al. [113] , Yehliu et al. [114] , Botero et al. [115] or 
Sharma  et  al.  [116] .  Different  soot  characteristics  obtained  with 
HRTEM,  such  as  the  interplanar  distance  and  the  length  of  the 
crystallites,  can  be  obtained  with  XRD  as  well  (according  to 
Eqs. (1) to (3) in Section 2.1 ). Most of the results [95] show that 
there is a qualitative agreement between both techniques. How- 
ever, in many of the studies [59,116–118] , a numerical discrepancy 
between  the  results  obtained  with  either  technique  has  been 

observed. According to Short et al. [117] and Guerrero Peña et al. 
[118] , the height of the peaks in XRD diffractograms is sensitive 
to the amount of larger crystallites, even if the quantity of these 
crystallites  is  small.  Thus,  the  length  of  the  crystallites  obtained 
with XRD is typically overestimated. In the study of Yehliu et al. 
[59]  and  Short  et  al.  [117] ,  the  use  of  the  Diamond’s  empirical 
formula is proposed to reduce this discrepancy. In addition, with 
HRTEM,  a  two-dimensional  projection  of  a  three-dimensional 
particle is analyzed, which could be another source of discrepancy 
between the results obtained with XRD and HRTEM. 

Different  authors  have  assessed  the  effect  of  engine  load  on 
soot nanostructural parameters obtained with HRTEM. According 
to  Xu  et  al.  [97]  [103]  and  Lu  et  al.  [100] ,  as  the  engine  load 
increases,  soot  nanostructure  becomes  more  ordered,  i.e.  lower 
tortuosity and higher length of the graphene layers. However, in 
the most recent study [100] , and in the study by Happonen et al. 
[111] , the differences between soot generated at different engine 
loads were negligible. In general, observed effects of engine load 
on  soot  nanostructure  are  consistent  with  trends  observed  in 
studies that use XRD and Raman spectroscopy. 

Regarding the effect of injection timing, Yehliu et al. [75] gener- 
ated soot at two different steady operation modes which differed 
in the injection timing by two crank angle degrees (4 degCA bTDC 
and  2  degCA  bTDC).  These  authors  found  that  soot  generated 
at  2  degCA  possessed  shorter  carbon  layer  lengths  than  soot 
generated at 4 °CA, although a larger variation range would have 
been preferable for conﬁrming this trend. On the other hand, Xu 
et  al.  [97]  observed  that,  at  high  load  conditions,  delaying  the 
injection timing from 5 degCA bTDC to 5 degCA aTDC led to a soot 
with higher carbon layer lengths. According to [97] , the increased 
precursor  concentration  together  with  the  higher  combustion 
duration at 5 degCA aTDC favored the addition of these species to 
the carbon layers. Sun et al. [119] qualitatively studied the effect 
of the dwell angle between main and post-injection on the soot 
nanostructure. Results obtained showed that soot from long dwell 
post-injection  has  higher  portion  of  amorphous  carbon  and  less 
ordered  graphene  layers.  With  regard  to  the  effect  of  injection 
pressure  on  soot  nanostructure,  Xu  et  al.  [103]  found  that  soot 
generated  at  higher  injection  pressure  had  lower  carbon  layer 
length and tortuosity. These investigators explained that increasing 
the injection pressure decreases the residence time of the fuel in 
the soot-forming region, resulting in less time for soot formation 
and  growth.  In  addition,  soot  precursors  are  reduced  at  higher 
injection pressures, which may decrease the soot nucleation and 
growth rates.  The combination of  these two  effects may explain 
the lower carbon layer length at higher injection pressures. Yehliu 
et  al.  [59]  studied  the  effect  of  injection  strategy  on  the  soot 
nanostructure observing that soot generated in an operation mode 
with  split  injection  had  lower  carbon  layer  length  compared  to 
soot generated in the mode with a single injection event. Finally, 
Li et al. [120] evaluated the effect of EGR on soot nanostructure 
observing that as the EGR increases soot nanostructure becomes 
more ordered, i.e., soot layers are longer and less tortuous. 

The effect of biodiesel and paraﬃnic fuels on soot nanostruc- 
ture has also been studied. Yehliu et al. [59] , Liati et al. [105] and 
Boehman  et  al.  [121]  found  that  soot  from  either  neat  biodiesel 
(derived  soybean  [59]  or  rapeseed  [105]  oils)  or  diesel-biodiesel 
blends  (B20  [121] )  has  a  more  disordered  nanostructure  than 
diesel  soot.  This  ﬁnding  is  contradictory  with  those  obtained 
with XRD and Raman spectroscopy, which showed, as a rule, that 
biodiesel soot has a more ordered nanostructure than diesel soot. 
On  the  other  hand,  with  regard  to  the  effect  of  paraﬃnic  fuel, 
Yehliu  et  al.  [59]  and  Song  et  al.  [80]  showed  that  soot  from 
Fischer-Tropsch fuel presents a more ordered nanostructure than 
soot  from  biodiesel.  In  the  study  of  Wei  et  al.  [46] ,  the  effect 
of  aromatic  on  soot  nanostructure  was  evaluated.  These  authors

observed  that  soot  from  fuels  with  aromatic  compounds  has  a 
more  amorphous  nanostructure  than  soot  from  non-aromatic 
fuels.  Finally,  Nithyanandan  et  al.  [84]  qualitatively  evaluated 
the  nanostructure  of  soot  generated  in  a  dual-fuel  combustion 
with  compressed  natural  gas.  They  showed  that  soot  generated 
with  a  higher  substitution  percentage  of  natural  gas  presents  a 
more  amorphous  nanostructure.  This  result  could  be  explained 
because  the  addition  of  natural  gas  reduces  the  formation  of 
soot  precursors  and  favors  the  formation  of  more  immature 
particles. 

2.4. Surface area analysis 

Surface  area  plays  an  important  role  in  solid-gas  reactions. 
The  analysis  of  this  characteristic  provides  information  about 
soot structure. It is expected that surface area is related to soot 
reactivity,  since  as  the  surface  area  increases the  oxidant  agents 
have more accessibility to the carbonaceous substrate. While X-ray 
diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and TEM describe the nano and 
microstructure of soot, surface area analysis provides information 
on a broad scale. However, it has been suggested [32] that more 
open carbon structures, i.e. those with lower values of fractal di- 
mension, show very high speciﬁc surface area as well, evidencing 
a connection between both parameters. 

This technique assesses the number of adsorption sites avail- 
able  on  a  particle  through  the  measurement  of  the  amount  of 
a  gas  (usually  N 
2 ),  which  can  be  adsorbed  on  the  particle  sur- 
face  at  a  ﬁxed  temperature.  In  this  way,  adsorption  isotherms 
are  obtained.  With  this  information  the  soot  surface  area  can 
be  estimated  using  BET  [122]  or  BJH  [123]  theories,  where  BET 

theory  is  most  commonly  used  in  the  literature  [47,124,125] . 
Typical adsorption isotherms for soot and graphite are shown in 
Fig.  1 ,  revealing  that  the  capacity  to  adsorb  gas  is  much  higher 
for  soot  than  for  graphite  (i.e.  soot  has  higher  speciﬁc  surface 
area). 

The  shape  of  the  adsorption  isotherm  depends  on  the  ad- 
sorption  process  on  the  surface  sample  and  it  is  related  to  the 
size  of  the  pores  in  the  sample.  According  to  IUPAC,  the  differ- 
ent  isotherms  can  be  classiﬁed  in  six  groups.  In  addition,  some 
isotherms have a hysteresis loop which is related to the shape and 
size (macro-, meso- and nanopores) of the pores in the sample. 

The effect of engine load, injection parameters or type of fuel 
on the soot surface area has rarely been evaluated in the literature. 
Only  in  [124]  were  the  effects  of  fuel  and  injection  parameters 
evaluated. Injection timing, injection pressure or injection strategy 
have no evident effect on the soot surface area. In contrast, the 
fuel seems to have a clear effect on the soot surface area. In this 
study [124] , soot was generated from three different fuels (diesel, 
HVO and GTL) and soot generated from paraﬃnic fuels (HVO and 
GTL)  was  observed  to  have  higher  surface  area  than  soot  from 
diesel fuel. 

Different  authors  have  characterized  the  surface  area  of  the 
soot analyzed in their work. Table 2 summarizes the results ob- 
tained by different authors that analyze soot surface area. In these 
studies,  the  surface  area  was  obtained  through  the  adsorption 
isotherm  via  BET  theory.  From  these  results,  some  conclusions 
can be drawn. First, a huge variation in the results of diesel soot 
surface area can be observed (20–450 m 2 /g). This is relevant since 
some  authors  [126]  set  100  m 2 /g  as  a  threshold  to  distinguish 
between  porous  and  nonporous  materials.  This  variation  can  be

associated  with  the  soot  sampling  method  used  in  the  different 
studies.  In  methods  that  use  vacuum  pumps,  the  pressure  drop 
exerted through the collecting ﬁlter is typically higher than that 
in a DPF during the soot trapping period (20–80 hPa), resulting in 
a decrease in the soot surface area. On the contrary, using other 
collection  methods  in  which  vacuum  pumps  are  not  necessary, 
the compaction process can be avoided. Thermal pre-treatment of 
soot is another factor that can affect the results shown in Table 2 . 
In  the  study  by  Azambre  et  al.  [127] ,  soot  that  was  thermally 
treated showed higher surface area than untreated soot. Thermal 
pre-treatment of the sample removes volatile compounds from the 
soot surface, thus recovering surface area. Arnal et al. [128] proved 
that if absorbed species are desorbed from the sample by treating 
it at high temperature and inert atmosphere, surface area increases 
up to 450-500 m 2 /g. This can explain the differences observed in 
Lapuerta et al. [124] and Ishiguro et al. [125] , despite their use of 
very similar collection methods. In [124] , soot was devolatilized, 
whereas in [125] nothing was mentioned, possibly indicating that 
no devolatilization process was performed. Finally, Table 2 shows 
that, as a rule, soot generated from paraﬃnic (HVO and GTL) and 
biodiesel fuels has a higher surface area than soot generated from 
diesel fuel, probably as a consequence of the lower mean diameter 
of primary particles. 

The soot active surface area (ASA) [33,40,41,51] has also been 
studied.  This  parameter  is  related  to  soot  active  sites,  which 
include  sites  such  as  those  bonded  to  heteroatoms,  nascent 
sites, or edge carbon atoms [51] . These active sites possess high 
binding  energy  with  oxygen  atoms,  which  reside  preferentially 
on  the  edges  or  defects  of  the  soot  basal  plane  [51] .  Active 
surface  area  is  determined  either  from  the  weight  uptake  of 
the  sample  due  to  oxygenated  compounds  that  form  at  ap- 
proximately  300  °C  after  the  material  has  been  outgassed  at  a 
temperature higher than 500 °C. Usually, the study of soot active 
surface  area  is  performed  with  a  thermogravimetric  analyzer 
(TGA,  see  Section  3 ).  The  study  of  the  active  surface  area  must 
be  done  carefully.  The  sample  weight  increases  very  slightly  as 
a  consequence  of  oxygen  chemisorption  and  a  well  calibrated 
analyzer  is  therefore  necessary  to  guarantee  that  the  weight 
variation  is  due  to  oxygen  chemisorption  and  not  to  other  ef- 
fects,  such  the  buoyancy  effect  [129]  or  inaccuracies  from  the 
analyzer. 

2.5. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) 

Electron  energy  loss  spectroscopy  provides  information  about 
the atomic structure of the sample. This technique measures the 
energy loss of the electrons resulting from the inelastic interaction 
of a beam of low-energy electrons with the orbital electrons from 
the  molecules  [135] .  The  energy  of  the  beam  and  the  distance 
from the electron probe to the sample must be carefully selected 
to avoid radiation damage and to obtain reliable results [136] . A 
typical soot spectrum obtained with this technique, and compared 
to one for graphite, is shown in Fig. 2 . 

As  shown  in  the  spectrum,  two  different  peaks  ( π ∗ and  σ ∗) 
can  be  distinguished.  π ∗ peak  is  located  around  285  eV  and  it 
is  associated  with  sp 2  hybridization  bonds  (graphitic  carbon  in 
soot). σ ∗ peak is located around 290–305 eV and it is associated 
with  sp 3  hybridization  bonds  (disorder  in  carbon  layers).  In  the 
reviewed  work,  soot  nanostructure  was  evaluated  based  on  the 
ratio between π ∗ peak and σ ∗ peak intensities (I π ∗ /I σ ∗ ). This ratio 
provides information about the relationship between the orbitals 
sp 2 /sp 3 in C = C bonds. As the ratio I π ∗ /I σ ∗ increases, the graphitic 
carbon  and  the  degree  of  order  of  soot  nanostructure  increases. 
In the investigation by Knauer et al. [138] , a correlation to study 
the  percentage  of  sp 2 -bonded  carbon  was  proposed.  To  use  this 
correlation, the spectra must be deconvoluted with three Gaussian 
curves. 

The  use  of  electron  energy  loss  spectroscopy  to  study  soot 
nanostructure is not widespread. However, there are some studies 
in which the nanostructure was assessed with this technique. In 
the study by Happonen et al. [111] , the effect of engine load on 
soot nanostructure was evaluated. In this investigation, soot was 
generated  in  a  heavy-duty  diesel  engine  at  two  different  loads 
(220 0 rpm at 10 0% engine load and 220 0 rpm at 50% engine load). 
Soot nanostructure was not observed to be affected by the engine 
load.  Al-Qurashi  et  al.  [51]  studied  the  effect  of  EGR  on  soot 
nanostructure with EELS. Based on the ratio I π ∗ /I σ ∗ , the authors 
observed that as the EGR increases, soot nanostructure becomes 
more disordered. This result was consistent with those obtained 
in the same study using other techniques. 

The effect of fuel on soot nanostructure, analyzed with EELS, 
has also been studied in the literature. Happonen et al. [111] eval- 
uated soot generated from two different fuels (diesel and HVO). In

this study soot spectra obtained with EELS were similar, although 
these spectra were analyzed qualitatively. The authors concluded 
that the fuel tested has no effect on soot nanostructure. In the in- 
vestigations by Song et al. [45,80] the nanostructure of soot gen- 
erated from a Fischer–Tropsch fuel and a neat soybean biodiesel 
fuel  was  studied.  Results  obtained  showed  that  soot  generated 
from biodiesel has a more ordered structure than soot generated 
from the Fischer-Tropsch fuel. More ordered biodiesel soot has also 
been  observed  in  other  studies  using  different  techniques.  Wei 
et al. [46] evaluated the effect of fuel aromatic compounds on soot 
nanostructure.  The  authors  observed  that  soot  generated  from  a 
fuel with aromatic compounds has a more disorder nanostructure 
than soot generated from a fuel without aromatics. This is consis- 
tent with the results obtained in this study with other techniques. 
Finally, soot generated in ﬂames was analyzed with EELS. Gogoi 
et al. [37] and Alrefaai et al. [39] assessed the effect of different 
additives  (2,5-dimethyfuran  and  dicyclopentadiene,  respectively) 
to diesel fuel. Results showed that as the quantity of additive was 
increased, soot nanostructure became more disordered, i.e., with 
lower I π ∗ /I σ ∗ ratio. 

2.6. Particle sizers 

Particle sizers are commonly used for classiﬁcation of exhaust 
particle agglomerates according to their size. Particle size strongly 
affects human health, since smaller particles are more prone to be 
absorbed by living organisms [139] . In the same way as the size of 
primary particles, smaller agglomerates have larger speciﬁc surface 
area and are thus more reactive towards oxidation. Particle sizers 
are based on the measurement of aerodynamic particle size (such 
as impactors or electrical low-pressure impactors -ELPI-) or elec- 
tric  mobility  diameter  (such  as  scanning  mobility  particle  sizers 
-SMPS-, exhaust particle size spectrometers -EEPS-, or differential 
mobility analyzers -DMA-), and their characteristics are compared 
elsewhere [140,141] . Rodríguez-Fernández et al. [15] measured the 
particle size distribution with a SMPS and calculated the average 
surface area assuming spherical particles and a density function. 
They  concluded  that  the  surface  area  correlated  well  with  soot 
reactivity. 

Among  the  engine  parameters,  most  authors  [142,143]  agree 
that  increasing  the  engine  speed  (at  constant  air-to-fuel  ratio) 
decreases the mean diameter of the particle distribution and the 
total  particle  concentration.  This  is  because  the  combustion  du- 
ration decreases and the primary soot particles have less time to 
form agglomerates. Increasing the engine load typically increases 
the mean diameter because more fuel is injected [144] . Increasing 
the injection pressure favors lower mean diameters because better 
air-fuel mixing is achieved, thus decreasing the number of primary 
particles available in the chamber to form agglomerates [145] . 

Assuming  that  both  primary  particle  size  and  agglomerate 
size  are  inversely  proportional  to  speciﬁc  surface  area  and  thus 
reactivity, a comparison of these methods is of interest. Compared 
to microscopy techniques for primary particle size determination 
( Section 2.3 ), particle (agglomerate) sizers provide straightforward 
results, with no or minimal post-processing. However, measuring 
with particle sizers implies a previous dilution of the exhaust gas 
sample,  which  promotes  the  nucleation  of  hydrocarbons  com- 
prising the majority of the nucleation mode ( < 30 nm), and thus, 
modiﬁes the size distribution by diminishing its mean diameter. 
This  may  be  the  reason  why,  occasionally,  when  comparing  dif- 
ferent engine modes [146] , lower mean diameters of the particle 
distribution  are  reported,  but  when  the  nonvolatile  part  of  the 
particles collected are subjected to an oxidation test, the sample 
is proven to be less reactive. 

In addition to the former application, particle sizers have been 
used  to  estimate  the  fractal  dimension  of  soot  agglomerates,  as 
an  indirect  method  to  characterize  soot  reactivity.  Based  on  the 
evidence  that  the  performance  of  both  types  of  instruments  are 
differently affected by the fractal structure of soot agglomerates, 
Kutz  and  Schmidt-Ott  [147]  proposed  estimation  of  the  fractal 
dimension  by  combining  a  differential  mobility  analyzer  and  a 
low-pressure impactor, although they did not apply their method 
to soot agglomerates. Van Gulijk et al. [148] obtained the fractal 
dimension of soot agglomerates from the combination of a SMPS 
and  an  ELPI.  Another  type  of  methods  is  based  on  the  combi- 
nation  of  particle  mass  measurement  (which  can  be  considered 
proportional to the number of primary particles if uniformity in 
size and density is assumed) with particle sizers. Burtscher et al. 

14 

M. Lapuerta, J. Rodríguez–Fernández and J. Sánchez-Valdepeñas / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100833 

[149] compared the mobility diameter (measured with SMPS) and 
the mass of the particles to obtain the fractal dimension using an 
equation similar to Eq. (5 ). However they used the mobility radius 
instead of the radius of gyration. 

Finally,  many  authors  such  as  Virtanen  et  al.  [150]  and  Yon 
et  al.  [151]  have  developed  methods  that  include  the  fractal 
dimension in a density function, and thus allow derivation of the 
fractal dimension from effective density measurements. 

3. Techniques for chemical characterization 

This group of techniques has been used to evaluate functional 
groups on the soot surface. If only soot is to be analyzed, methods 
that dilute and cool down the exhaust gas should be avoided to 
impede  hydrocarbon  condensation  on  the  soot  surface  as  much 
as  possible.  In  any  case,  methods  that  collect  soot  directly  from 
the combustion chamber are expected to provide different results 
to those sampling from the exhaust pipe, since the soot chemical 
composition is continuously changing inside the chamber due to 
very high temperatures. 

Despite the fact that they are more affordable to laboratories 
(especially  infrared  analysis  in  any  of  its  variations),  chemical 
analysis  techniques  have  not  been  as  widely  used  as  structural 
ones. This is because the morphological and absorptive properties 
of  soot  hinder  the  analysis,  the  results  are  typically  obtained  in 
the form of more-or-less overlapped peaks and the quality of the 
signal  depends  on  the  correct  choice  of  technique.  Nevertheless, 
these  chemical  techniques  are  necessary  for  identifying  inter- 
mediate  compounds  and  functionalities  that  are  formed  during 
the  reaction  of  soot  with  several  oxidant  species  (as  detailed  in 
next  section).  This  information  could  explain  from  a  chemical 
perspective the differences in reactivity among different samples. 
The  studies  reviewed  here  mainly  identify  functional  groups  on 
soot in a qualitative, but not quantitative, manner. 

This section is divided into three sub-sections according to the 
type  of  technique,  two  sections  for  techniques  that  characterize 
dry soot and a third for characterization of adsorbed hydrocarbons. 
First, techniques based on absorption/scattering of radiation such 
as infrared techniques (FTIR, DRIFTS and ATR), energy dispersive 
spectroscopy (EDS) and near edge X ray absorption ﬁne structure 
(NEXAFS) are reviewed. Second, techniques based on atomic exci- 
tation, such as X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR), are brieﬂy described. Third, chromato- 
graphic techniques for chemical characterization of hydrocarbons 
that are adsorbed or condensed on the soot surface are discussed. 

3.1. Techniques based on absorption or scattering of radiation 

These techniques provide information about functional groups 
on  the  soot  surface  from  absorption  or  scattering  of  radiation 
upon  interaction  with  the  sample.  Not  all  the  techniques  based 
on this phenomenon are used to the same extent. While the use 
of  infrared  analysis  techniques  is  widespread,  near  edge  X  ray 
absorption ﬁne structure (NEXAFS) is only used in a few studies. 

Infrared techniques identify the soot surface compounds from 
the interaction between infrared radiation with soot. Infrared ra- 
diation in the range of 40 0 0–40 0 cm −1 is absorbed by the organic 
molecules  and  converted  in  molecular  vibration,  and  infrared 
spectra  are  thus  obtained  ( Fig.  3 ).  The  frequency  or  wavelength 
of absorption depends on different factors: relative masses of the 
atoms, bonds and molecular geometry [152] . Infrared techniques 
used to evaluate the soot (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
– FTIR, diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy 
– DRIFTS  and  attenuated  total  reﬂectance  – ATR)  are  based  on 
this physical principle. FTIR is the most commonly used technique 
in the literature for identifying the functional groups on the soot 

surface. However, in case of analyzing pulverized solids, the use 
of DRIFTS is more suitable than FTIR, because diffuse reﬂectance, 
which is produced from the interaction between the soot sample 
and the infrared radiation, is collected with this technique. Finally, 
ATR has been used in a few studies and the results obtained are 
not very promising so far [96] , although it has the advantage of 
a lower attenuation of the radiation due to a shorter path length 
into the sample [32] . 

In near edge X ray absorption ﬁne structure (NEXAFS), the soot 
sample is irradiated with an X ray beam. Due to the interaction 
between soot and X-ray radiation, an absorption peak is produced, 
known  as  the  absorption  edge.  The  energy  range  at  which  the 
absorption edge appears is unique for each chemical element, and 
so, identiﬁcation of chemical compounds that absorb the radiation 
is possible [153–155] . Results obtained with this technique were 
used by Liati et al. [154] to study soot nanostructure by examining 
the  degree  of  graphitization  of  the  soot.  This  parameter,  ﬁrst 
proposed by Jäger et al [156] , was deﬁned as the ratio between 
the  intensities  of  the  peaks  located  at  285.3  eV  and  292  eV, 
respectively.  These  peaks  are  related  to  the  molecular  bonding 
environment  of  carbon  atoms.  A  typical  soot  spectrum  obtained 
with NEXAFS is shown in Fig. 4 . 

From the spectra shown in Figs. 5 and 6 , the functional groups 
on  soot  can  be  determined.  Each  peak  or  band  in  these  spectra 
can be assigned to a functional group according to Tables 3 and 4 , 
as explained in the literature. 

Not many studies have evaluated the effect of engine load on 
soot functional groups with infrared techniques or NEXAFS. Wang 
et al. [172] generated soot in a six-cylinder heavy-duty diesel en- 
gine running at two different loads, which was then analyzed with 
infrared spectroscopy. In this study, the ratio of the aromatic peak 
( I 1620 )  (other  peaks  associated  with  aromatics  were  neglected) 
and the aliphatic peak ( I 2925 ) was used to determine the relative 
presence of aromatic groups ( I 1620 / I 2925 ). The results revealed that 
i)  the  engine  load  has  no  effect  on  the  aromatic  concentration 
and ii) soot reactivity (quantiﬁed with TGA analysis) seems to be 
well correlated with the aliphatic concentration. Also, Parent et al. 
[55] and Liati et al. [154] studied the effect of the aircraft engine 
load  on  soot  properties  with  NEXAFS.  Parent  et  al.  [55]  did  not

ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect, probably due to the narrow load range 
tested (70–100%), but Liati et al. [154] reported an increase in the 
degree of graphitization of high-load (85–100%) soot compared to 
idle soot. The effect of engine load on soot functional groups was 
also analyzed by Braun et al. [171] . In this study soot generated 
at  high  engine  load  presented  more  aromatic  compounds  than 
soot generated at low engine load. This result disagrees with that 
from Wang et al. [172] . Braun’s research group, at the University 
of  Kentucky,  carried  out  several  investigations  where  soot  was 
analyzed with NEXAFS, but in all these studies the analysis was 
qualitative (the peaks in the spectrum were assigned to a speciﬁc 
functional group) [155,169,173] . 

In the investigation by Lapuerta et al. [124] , soot generated in 
a  Euro  5  diesel  engine  was  analyzed  with  DRIFTS  (among  other 
techniques). Results obtained in this investigation show that en- 
gine parameters (injection timing, injection pressure and injection 
strategy) do not have a signiﬁcant effect on soot functional groups, 
since  error  bars  overlap  in  most  of  the  cases.  However,  HVO 
presented more oxygenated functionalities (hydroxyl groups) than

increases.  The  authors  explained  that  this  could  be  related  to 
the  higher  reactivity  of  soot  generated  in  dual  fuel  combustion. 
Ruiz et al. [41] came to the same conclusion when analyzing soot 
generated  in  a  dual  fuel  combustion  with  n-butanol  or  hydrous 
ethanol.  The  results  obtained  with  FTIR  and  thermogravimetry 
(see  Section  3 )  show  a  clear  correlation  between  soot  reactivity 
and the concentration of aliphatic and oxygenated (OH) functional 
groups. In contrast, different conclusions were obtained by Gogoi 
et al. [37] , where soot generated in an atmospheric-pressure dif- 
fusion ﬂame was analyzed with FTIR. In this work, soot reactivity 
measured with TGA increased as the aromatic compounds on soot 
surface decreased. 

As can be seen in this section, the effect of functional groups 
on soot reactivity is not well understood. According to some work 
[45,82] ,  oxygenated  compounds  can  improve  soot  reactivity,  as 
it  has  been  hypothesized  that  these  intermediate  oxygenated 
compounds  formed  during  soot  oxidation  have  inﬂuence  on  key 
oxidation  reactions.  On  the  other  hand,  these  oxygenated  com- 
pounds could attack the active sites present in structural defects, 
favoring the removal of these defects, and thus obtaining a more 
graphitized,  and  less  reactive,  soot.  For  this  reason,  determin- 
ing  which  soot  characteristics  have  the  most  inﬂuence  on  soot 
reactivity requires execution of a complete soot characterization.

3.2. Techniques based on atomic excitation 

the other fuels (diesel and GTL). According to Song et al. [45] , the 
presence of oxygenated compounds on diesel soot could be related 
to a higher reactivity. 

The effect of fuel has been evaluated in various studies with 
different  infrared  techniques.  Song  et  al.  [45]  used  FTIR  to  an- 
alyze  soot  generated  from  four  different  fuels  (diesel,  soybean 
biodiesel,  Fischer-Tropsch  fuel  and  a  B20  biodiesel-diesel  blend). 
In this study, the ratio of the carboxyl peak and the aromatic peak 
( I 1740 / I 1620 ) was used to determine the relative presence of oxygen 
groups. The results revealed that the presence of oxygenated func- 
tionalities is strongly correlated with soot reactivity (quantiﬁed by 
thermogravimetric analysis). This conclusion can also be inferred 
from Salamanca et al. [82] , although the authors did not formulate 
it  in  an  explicit  way.  Similar  results  were  obtained  by  Soriano 
et al. [40] . The authors used FTIR to analyze different soot samples 
from  different  fuels  (diesel,  72%  soybean-28%  palm  biodiesel, 
GTL  and  farnesane).  The  spectra  obtained  showed  that  biodiesel 
soot  presents  the  highest  absorbance  peaks  for  oxygenated  and 
aliphatic  groups,  which  could  be  related  to  its  higher  reactivity. 
Furthermore, the higher reactivity of GTL soot compared to diesel 
and farnesane soot  could be  explained by the  higher content  of 
aliphatic  compounds  in  GTL  soot.  This  last  conclusion  was  also 
reached by Agudelo et al. [33] . In this study, soot generated from 
three different fuels (one diesel and two crude vegetable oils) was 
examined with FTIR and DRIFTS. The results revealed that aliphatic 
groups are more important in governing soot oxidation reactivity 
than  other  oxygenated  surface  functional  groups  because  these 
aliphatic  groups  contribute  to  increase  the  interplanar  distance 
between layers. These results agree with that of Wang et al. [172] , 
although this study does not offer any explanation for the appar- 
ent  relationship  between  soot  reactivity  and  aliphatic  functional 
groups. 

Nithyanandan et al. [84] used DRIFTS, among other techniques, 
to  characterize  soot  from  a  dual  fuel  combustion  (diesel  and 
compressed  natural  gas)  in  a  single-cylinder  diesel  engine.  The 
results  showed  that  as  the  natural  gas  substitution  increases 
the  concentration  of  aliphatic  and  oxygenated  functional  groups 

Techniques based on atomic excitation can also provide infor- 
mation  about  the  functional  groups  on  soot.  Among  techniques 
based on this physical principle, the most commonly used are X 
ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). 

In  X  ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  a  monochromatic 
soft  X  ray beam  interacts with  core  electrons around  the  nuclei 
of the different atoms that are present in the surface of the soot 
sample  under  high  vacuum  [174] .  As  consequence  of  this  inter- 
action, photoelectrons are emitted and their energy is measured 
with a spectrometer. The binding energy of the emitted electrons 
is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  incident  radiation 
energy and the energy measured in the spectrometer. A spectrum 
is thus obtained in which each element of the sample produces 
a series of characteristic peaks at a certain binding energy, from 
which the element in the soot sample can be identiﬁed. 

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides information about 
the  chemical  structure  of  soot  samples.  Brieﬂy,  a  soot  sample 
is  placed  in  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  and  it  is  irradiated  with  radiofre- 
quencies. In this way, the nuclei that form the sample resonates. 
As  the  nuclei  relax  back  to  their  initial  energy  state,  they  emit 
electromagnetic  radiation,  which  provides  information  about  the 
functional groups on the soot sample [175] . In the different studies 
reviewed, soot was analyzed with 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR, although 
both types of NMR are complementary. 

Finally, in energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), a high energy 
electron beam collides against the atoms that form soot. As result 
of  this  collision,  an  electron  from  an  inner  shell  is  expelled, 
creating a vacancy which is then occupied by an upper electronic 
level electron. In this process, X rays are released with an energy 
equal to the difference between the two electronic shells involved 
in this phenomenon. These X rays provide information about the 
chemical  compounds  in  the  soot  sample,  because  the  energy  of 
these  X  rays  is  characteristic  for  each  chemical  element  [176] , 
although  the  detection  of  elements  with  low  atomic  number 
(Z < 11)  is  less  accurate.  This  constitutes  a  limitation  of  this  par- 
ticular technique for soot analysis. For this reason, this technique 
has  been  used  mainly  to  evaluate  the  presence  of  contaminants 
on  soot.  Ultimately,  this  technique  is  commonly  used  together

with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, see Section 1.2) or 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 

Typical  soot  spectra  obtained  with  XPS,  NMR  and  EDS  are 
shown  in  Figs.  7 –9  respectively.  Upon  analysis  of  these  spectra, 
information  about  the  functional  groups  and  chemical  elements 
on soot can be obtained. According to the literature consulted, the 
peaks  that  appear  in  these  spectra  are  assigned  to  the  different 
chemical compounds present on soot, as listed in Tables 5 –7 . 

As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 5 , the peaks corresponding to the 
different functional groups are within a narrow range of energies 
(284–290  eV  for  carbon  and  532–535  eV  for  oxygen).  For  this 
reason, the deconvolution of these bands may not be accurate, and 
so,  some  investigators  have  used  derivatization  reactions  [177] . 
These  reactions  transform  a  particular  functional  group  present 

on  the  soot  surface  into  another  functional  group  with  a  differ- 
entiating  chemical  element  which  is  easily  detectable  in  an  XPS 
analysis. However, despite the limitations mentioned above, there 
are a high number of investigators that use this technique without 
a previous derivatization process [53,59,119] . Additionally, nuclear 
magnetic  resonance  has  traditionally  been  used  to  analyze  coal 
[178,179] , although there is some work in which soot is analyzed 
with this technique [106,159,166,180,181] . Finally, energy dispersive 
spectroscopy has not been widely used for soot analysis, due to 
the limitations mentioned above. 

The effect of engine load on soot functional groups was studied 
by Wang et al. [172] . By studying the high-resolution carbon band 
obtained  with  XPS,  they  observed  that  the  oxygenated  surface 
groups  did  not  show  correlation  with  soot  reactivity  evaluated

with  TGA.  This  conclusion  appears  to  be  in  disagreement  with 
the ﬁndings from Song et al. [45] , who analyzed soot with FTIR 
and observed that the oxidation reactivity of diesel soot is more 
dependent on the relative initial surface oxygen groups than soot 
structure or pore size distribution. However, Wang et al. [172] only 
identiﬁed  two  oxygenated  functional  groups  (C –OH  and  C = O), 
meaning  that  it  is  not  possible  to  dismiss  the  possibility  that 
other  oxygenated  functionalities  also  inﬂuence  soot  reactivity. 
The effect of engine load was also studied by Mustaﬁ et al. [76] . 
They observed that soot generated at low and high load contain 
the same functional groups in general, although some differences 
were  found.  While  soot  at  high  load  did  not  contain  alcohol  or 
ether functional groups, soot at low load did not present paraﬃnic 
groups. 

In  line  with  the  above  investigations,  Parent  et  al.  [55]  used 
XPS  among  other  techniques,  to  study  the  effect  of  engine  load 
on soot generated in the exhaust of a turbofan engine. This study 
was  mainly  qualitative  and  focused  on  the  high-resolution  oxy- 
gen  spectrum.  Results  obtained  showed  the  presence  of  ketone, 
carbonyl,  carboxyl  and  ether  functional  groups,  similar  to  those 
present  on  diesel  soot.  In  [186] ,  the  authors  used  XPS  for  the 
analysis  of  soot  collected  from  four  aircrafts,  and  their  results 
indicated that around 20% of the content were oxygenated groups. 
The  effect  of  fuel  injection  parameters  on  soot  functional 
groups has also been evaluated with XPS. Sun et al. [119] studied 
the impact of the amount of fuel by post-injection and the dwell 
angle between main and post injection. This study was performed 
with a modern diesel engine running with ultra-low sulfur diesel. 
These investigators quantiﬁed the sp 3 /sp 2  carbon ratio from XPS 
spectra. This ratio provides information about the defects on soot 
nanostructure, and it is calculated as the area of the deconvoluted 

band centered at 285 eV (that corresponds to sp 2 hybridized car- 
bon, which represents ordered carbon [187] ) divided by the area of 
the deconvoluted band centered in 284.2 eV (attributed to sp 3 hy- 
bridized carbon and representing defects that can disrupt the sp 2 
hybridized network  [188,189] ). Results  showed  that  as  the  dwell 
angle  increased,  the  oxygen  functional  groups  on  soot  increased 
too.  Furthermore,  this  study  reveals  a  good  correlation  between 
oxygenated  functional  groups  and  soot  reactivity  (analyzed  with 
TGA),  similar  to  the  investigation  by  Song  [45] .  Yehliu  et  al. 
[59] analyzed the effect of the injection strategy (single injection 
and split injection) on soot surface groups with XPS. They showed 
that the use of single injection or split injection has no effect on 
oxygenated  functional  groups,  although  this  conclusion  it  is  not 
mentioned explicitly in the study. However, the concentration of 
oxygenated  functional  groups  was  not  well  correlated  with  soot 
reactivity. This ﬁnding agrees with that obtained by Wang et al. 
[172] , but it is in disagreement with those obtained by Song et al. 
[45] and Sun et al. [119] . 

Regarding  the  effect  of  fuel,  Yehliu  et  al.  [59]  observed  the 
effect  of  three  different  fuels  (diesel,  soybean  biodiesel  and  a 
Fischer-Tropsch  fuel)  oxygenated  functional  groups  on  soot  from 
XPS  spectra.  Results  revealed  that  there  was  no  difference  be- 
tween the content of oxygenated functional groups of the different 
fuels.  Mustaﬁ et  al.  [76]  observed  several  differences  between 
the  functional  groups  of  soot  generated  with  diesel  and  soot 
generated in a dual fuel combustion with natural gas. The main 
difference between these types of soot was the lower amount of 
aromatic groups on the soot generated in the dual fuel combustion 
process.  Liu  et  al.  [189] ,  also  used  XPS  to  analyze  the  effect  of 
fuel on soot oxygenated functional groups. In this study, soot was 
generated  from  two  different  fuels:  n-heptane  and  a  mixture  of 
n-heptane and toluene. The authors evaluated the high-resolution 
carbon peak and they observed that the presence of oxygenated 
groups  (C –OH  and  C = O)  was  higher  in  the  n-heptane/toluene 
soot.  This  soot  possessed  a  more  tortuous  nanostructure,  be- 
cause  the  addition  of  toluene  enhances  the  generation  of  PAHs 
with  ﬁve-membered  rings,  thus  providing  more  active  sites 
for  the  bonding  of  OH  and  O  radicals  during  the  oxidation 
process. 

However,  the  results  from  chemical  analysis  techniques  are 
often  contradictory.  This  could  be  explained  because  generally, 
the spectra obtained with XPS are not suﬃciently well deﬁned, or 
they show overlapped peaks that may lead to uncertainties or in- 
accuracies in their interpretation. Previous chemical derivatization 
reactions, which have been only marginally used so far, may be a 
promising path to eliminate uncertainties. Studies by Langley et al. 
[177] and Lapuerta et al. [43] compared soot analysis before and 
after  derivatization,  and  both  revealed  the  presence  of  carbonyl, 
carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and permitted their quantiﬁcation. 

Ma  et  al.  [106] ,  Fernandes  et  al.  [180]  and  Clague  et  al. 
[181]  studied  soot  generated  in  diesel  engines  with  13 C  NMR. 
These  authors  observed  that  soot  was  mainly  composed  of  aro- 

M. Lapuerta, J. Rodríguez–Fernández and J. Sánchez-Valdepeñas / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100833 

19 

matic functionalities, in addition to alkyl and carbonyl functional 
groups.  On  the  other  hand,  different  authors  [159,166]  analyzed 
soot with 1 H NMR. Manoj et al. [166] used 1 H NMR soot spectrum 
to  show  that  diesel  soot  is  mainly  composed  of  large  chains  of 
aliphatic  hydrocarbons  joined  to  different  aromatic  rings.  These 
results agree with those obtained by Santamaría et al. [159] , who 
analyzed soot from an ethylene inverse diffusion ﬂame. 

There  are  not  too  many  studies  in  which  soot  was  analyzed 
with EDS, and these investigations have been mainly focused on 
the study of inorganic impurities on soot. In these studies, diesel 
soot presents a lower quantity of impurities than biodiesel soot, 
and  these  impurities  are  composed  mainly  of  calcium,  zinc  and 
phosphor [81,105,166,190,191] . According to Moldanová et al. [192] , 
the presence of impurities such as inorganic salts and oxides may 
contribute to catalyze the soot oxidation process. 

As mentioned in the previous section, different studies try to 
ﬁnd  relationships  between  the  results  obtained  with  the  tech- 
niques described above and soot reactivity. However, contradictory 
conclusions  have  been  obtained  and  the  need  to  carry  out  a 
complete soot characterization is evident. 

3.3. Chromatographic techniques 

Finally,  chromatographic  techniques  can  be  used  to  identify 
and, eventually, quantify hydrocarbons adsorbed on the soot sur- 
face. If these hydrocarbons are present in the material trapped in a 
DPF (e.g., due to extended very low-temperature operation such as 
idle speed), they can modify the oxidative reactivity of the sample. 
The base approach uses organic solvents to extract the soluble 
organic fraction (SOF), followed by a concentration step of the liq- 
uid to remove most of the solvent. The extract is ﬁnally analyzed 
in  gas  chromatography  coupled  to  mass  spectrometry  (GC-MS) 
[193]  or  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC).  With  these  methods,  a 
decrease in the amount of organic matter with increasing engine 
load  has  been  reported  [194] ,  which  was  mainly  composed  of 
linear and branched paraﬃns (65–90%) and PAHs (less than 25%, 
with the lowest contents at high torque and high speed). Balles- 
teros et al. [195] analyzed adsorbed PAHs in HPLC, reporting an 
increase  with  the  EGR  ratio  and  the  presence  of  ethanol  in  the 
fuel blend, and no effect of the injection strategy. When the same 
researchers [196] tested biodiesel fuels, they found less adsorbed 
PAHs compared to conventional diesel fuels. 

The selection of the solvent is essential to assure the solubility 
of all the hydrocarbons. To avoid uncertainty in this process, laser 
desorption has been proposed instead. One method consists in us- 
ing MS for identifying hydrocarbons previously desorbed from the 
soot substrate with a two-step laser, the ﬁrst laser for HC desorp- 
tion and the second one for HC ionization (abbreviated as L2MS) 
[197] . This technique has been used to successfully identify mix- 
tures of PAHs on the soot surface, ranging from 10 to 25 C-atoms 
and 8 to 14 H-atoms [198] . Similar results were obtained by Storey 
et al [199] in a GC-MS with a different desorption technique. Other 
procedures have been developed to inject the solid sample with 
absorbed HCs directly through the injector of the GC [200] . 

Regardless of the technique, the ﬁnal MS spectra are complex 
and their interpretation is challenging. Recently, statistical multi- 
variate analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis 
and hierarchical clustering analysis, have been successfully applied 
for this task [201] . 

4. Techniques for thermal characterization 

4.1. General description 

a  “group  of  techniques  in  which  a  property  of  the  sample  is 
monitored against time or temperature while the temperature of 
the  sample,  in  a  speciﬁed  atmosphere,  is  programmed”.  Precise 
and reliable measurements are not trivial since thermal methods 
work  under  non-equilibrium conditions  as  a  consequence  of  the 
temperature  gradient  between  the  sample  and  its  surroundings 
(often  referred  to  as  thermal  lag).  Besides,  temperature  is  often 
non-homogenous throughout the sample, and thus, these methods 
provide integral results [203] . Both thermal lag and temperature 
proﬁle  depend  on  instrumental,  operational  and  sample  param- 
eters,  which  may  impede  the  comparison  of  results  reported  by 
different authors. 

Despite these limitations, the most favorable point of thermal 
analysis techniques is that the result is a direct measurement of 
soot reactivity, which is not a physical- or chemical-independent 
property,  but  the  ﬁnal  effect  of  some  or  all  properties  on  the 
oxidation of soot. The instruments are simple to use and available 
in  any  lab,  and  the  result  can  be  easily  interpreted.  They  are 
ﬂexible enough to mimic the conditions in practical applications 
(temperature  range,  temperature  gradient,  atmosphere  compo- 
sition,  ambient  pressure).  Moreover,  it  is  common  to  develop 
home-made instruments, or to adapt the existing ones, to enhance 
the  research  potential.  The  technique  most  commonly  used  to 
study  the  soot  oxidation  pattern  or  the  soot  reactivity  is  TGA 
(thermogravimetric  analysis),  although  other  techniques  such  as 
DSC  (differential  scanning  calorimetry)  or  techniques  based  on 
chemical reactors have been used, but not to the same extent than 
TGA.  From  the  information  obtained  with  these  techniques,  two 
types of studies can be performed: a) soot reactivity ( Section 4.2 ) 
and b) soot oxidation kinetics ( Section 4.3 ). 

Thermogravimetric analysis and scanning differential calorime- 
try  have been used to study the soot oxidation process through 
the loss of soot mass, in the case of TGA, and the energy released 
by soot oxidation, in the case of DSC. With both techniques the 
conditions under which the oxidation process is carried out can 
be selected, i.e., the oxidant agents or the heating method (either 
isotherm or heating ramp), among others. With techniques based 
on chemical reactors, the same type of studies as with TGA and 
DSC  can  be  performed.  However,  the  main  differences  lie  in 
the  chamber  in  which  the  oxidation  process  is  carried  out  and 
the  variable  being  monitored.  For  techniques  based  on  chemical 
reactors, the geometry of the chamber is designed based on the 
process  that  the  investigators  want  to  replicate.  While  TGA  and 
DSC  instruments  measure  the  mass  loss  or  the  energy  released, 
respectively,  techniques  based  on  chemical  reactors  are  typically 
prepared to record the evolution of the reactants and/or products 
(mainly  CO 
2 )  of  the  oxidation  reaction.  Typical  soot  oxidation 
thermograms  obtained  with  TGA,  DSC  or  techniques  based  on 
chemical reactors are shown in Fig. 8 . Thermograms obtained with 
TGA ( Fig. 8 a) and b)) represent the conversion fraction ( α) and the 
normalized  mass  loss  rate  (d α/d T )  instead  of  the  mass  loss  and 
the  mass  loss  rate,  as  these  normalized  variables  are  commonly 
used  in  the  study  of  the  solid  state  reactions  [204] .  As  shown 
in Fig. 10 a) and b), graphite is less reactive than soot and needs 
higher temperature, under a heating ramp test, or a longer time, 
under an isotherm test, to complete oxidation. The normalization 
of  the  studied  variable  is  possible,  although  less  common,  with 
all  other  thermal  techniques.  Under  a  temperature  ramp,  peaks 
at lower temperatures than that shown in Fig. 10 b) and d) could 
appear if there is water or hydrocarbons adsorbed in the sample. 

4.2. Soot reactivity from thermal characterization 

According to the International Confederation for Thermal Anal- 
ysis  and  Calorimetry  [202] ,  thermal  analysis  methods  comprise 

In studies about soot reactivity, the investigators have followed 
different criteria. When soot is oxidized being subjected to heat- 
ing  ramps,  some  authors  [206]  have  deﬁned  temperatures  that

are  characteristic  of  the  oxidation  process  such  as  the  starting 
oxidation  temperature  ( SOT ),  ﬁnal  oxidation  temperature  ( FOT ), 
triggering  oxidation  temperature  ( TOT )  and  maximum  mass  loss 
rate temperature ( MLRT max ). In a study by Bhardwaj et al. [44] , the 
temperatures  at  which  10,  50  and  90  %  of  the  initial  soot  mass 
is oxidized, were used. In other studies, involving biomass rather 
than soot [207] , the authors have proposed another parameter to 
characterize  the  reactivity  of  the  sample.  This  parameter,  called 
reactivity  in  the  above-mentioned  study,  is  the  reaction  rate 
constant for a ﬁrst-order reaction model. 

The effect of engine load on soot reactivity has been examined 
in different studies, but the results are not always consistent. The 
most  accepted  trend  is  that  as  the  engine  load  increases,  soot 
reactivity decreases [41,75,100,103] . Ruiz et al. [41] and Xu et al. 
[103] explained this inverse relationship between engine load and 

soot reactivity through soot nanostructure, although this relation- 
ship has not been observed in other studies [40,78] . On the con- 
trary, Leidenberger et al. [98] found the opposite trend, although it 
is not said explicitly. Finally, other authors [16,206] did not observe 
any evident relationship between soot reactivity and engine load. 

Regarding  the  effect  of  engine  parameters  on  soot  reactivity, 
Yehliu  et  al.  [75]  generated  soot  at  a  steady  operation  mode 
with  two  different  injection  timing  settings  (injection  starts  at 
4  °CA  bTDC  and  2  °CA  bTDC).  Despite  the  small  variation,  they 
found that soot generated at 2 °CA was more reactive than soot 
generated  at  4  °CA.  Sun  et  al.  [119]  studied  the  effect  of  soot 
post-injection  on  soot  reactivity,  concluding  that  soot  from  long 
dwell  post-injection  conditions  shows  higher  reactivity  than 
soot  from  short  dwell  post-injections.  They  explained  that  soot 
nanostructure  with  higher  portions  of  amorphous  carbon  and 
less  ordered  graphene  layers  under  long  dwell  post-injections 
is  responsible  for  this  result.  Other  investigators  have  studied 
the  effect  of  injection  pressure  on  soot  reactivity.  All  of  them 
[58,78,79,98,103,124]  observed that soot  generated  in  engine 
modes with higher injection pressure shows higher reactivity. Xu 
et al. [103] argued that i) small graphene layer segments at high 
injection pressure increase the ratio of edge sites, which provides 
more active sites for oxidation and ii) smaller primary particle size 
for soot generated in the higher injection pressure mode provides 
more surface for oxidation. This last argument is coincident with 
that  proposed  by  Leidenberger  et  al.  [98] .  Finally,  the  effect  of 
EGR on soot reactivity has also been evaluated, with contradictory 
results. While Rohani et al. [36] and Li et al. [120] found that soot 
generated at higher EGR levels is less reactive than soot generated 
at  lower  EGR  levels,  Al-Qurashi  et  al.  [51]  found  the  opposite 
result. According to [51] , soot generated with high EGR exhibited 
dual simultaneous burning modes (fast internal burning and slow 
external  burning),  which  favors  the  accessibility  of  oxygen  to 
the interior of the particles, thus explaining the higher reactivity 
of  this  soot.  Li  et  al.  [120]  explained  that  the  differences  ob- 
served between their results and the results from Al-Qurashi et al. 
[51] could be attributed to the engine conditions. While in [51] the 
operating  conditions  led  to  a  premixed-dominated  heat  release 
pattern, in [120] the operating conditions mainly led to diffusion 
combustion.

The effect of the oxidation atmosphere has also been analyzed. 
This  parameter  is  important  for  understanding  the  oxidation 
process in the DPF. Besides air, the effect of NO 
2 on soot oxidation 
has  been  studied,  since  this  gas  is  present  at  a  non-negligible 
concentration  in  the  exhaust  gas.  According  to  Shrivastava  et  al. 
[208] NO 
2 promoting low tempera- 
ture oxidation of soot in the range of 200 °C–400 °C. This ﬁnding 
was conﬁrmed in different studies [209–211] . Rodríguez-Fernández 
et  al.  [210]  found  that  NO 
2  slightly  enhances  soot  oxidation  at 
temperatures below 300 °C. Nevertheless, at higher temperatures 
soot oxidation was dominated by oxygen availability. 

2 is a stronger oxidant than O 

2 -soot  or  NO 

Different  studies  have  shown  that  the  adsorption/desorption 
processes, the formation of intermediate species, and the oxidation 
mechanisms  involved  in  O 
2 -soot  reactions  are  dif- 
ferent. Under an oxygen atmosphere, the formation of metastable 
compounds  on  the  surface  that  later  desorb  in  the  form  of  CO 
has  been  documented  [212] .  Also,  carbonyl,  quinone  and  pyrone 
functionalities  [213]  have  been  identiﬁed,  among  others.  This 
variety of intermediates could be responsible for the existence of 
a  whole  range  of  activation  energies  during  the  adsorption  and 
desorption steps, as concluded in [214] , resulting in the release of 
both CO and CO 
2 . Therefore, Schejbal et al. [215,216] proposed the 
simpliﬁed reaction R.1 (assuming that the particle matter contains 
2 ,  with 
only  elementary  carbon)  to  describe  soot  oxidation  by  O 
the fraction of CO 
2 availability in 
the reaction zone. In reaction R.1, the carbon fraction that is not 
totally oxidized is represented by coeﬃcient f CO .

In the case of soot interaction with NO 

such  as  C-NO 

2 ,  C-ONO  and  C-N-NO 

2 , intermediate products 
2 ,  which  are  different  from 

2 and NO 

2  attack,  are  formed  at  low  temperature 
those  found  under  O 
2 with 
[217] . This can explain the higher reactivity of soot with NO 
2 . After the reaction, CO and CO 
respect to the reactivity with O 
2 
are formed, like in the case of O 
2 atmosphere, but NO is formed as 
well. Schejbal et al. [215,216] and Stanmore et al. [217] proposed 
different  oxidation  reactions  (R.2  to  R.4)  in  their  investigations 
to study the NO 
2 -soot reaction. Additionally, a different oxidation 
reaction (R.5) was proposed for the oxidation of soot in the pres- 
ence of both O 
2 [215,216] . This reaction helps explain the 
synergistic effect sometimes described. Setiabudi et al. [211] and 
Seong et al. [218] observed that the oxidation process takes place 
2 are involved together. Schejbal et al. 
at higher rates if O 
2 , the 
[215] explained that, in the presence of 10% of O 
reaction rate at 300 °C is about twice as high as that of soot-NO 
2 
reaction.  Finally,  Abián  et  al.  [209]  examined  the  reactivity  of 
several soot samples in a tubular reactor under two atmospheres: 
2 . At 500 °C, all samples were completely 
500 ppm NO 
oxidized in the presence of NO 
2 , it was necessary 
to increase the temperature up to 600 °C to complete the reaction. 
This suggests the much higher reactivity of soot with NO 

2 , but with 5% O

Distinct  from  NO 

2 ,  NO  is  less  effective  as  an  oxidant  and 
temperatures  higher  than  600  °C  are  required.  The  reactivity  of 
carbonaceous  samples  with  oxygen  and  NO  was  compared  in 
[219] , at concentrations of 50 0–20 0 0 ppm and at a temperature of 
10 0 0 °C (such a high temperature is needed for NO to show some 
reactivity). Even at this temperature, oxygen was shown to be a 
more effective oxidant. 

The  effect  of  fuel  on  soot  reactivity  has  been  widely 
studied.  The  literature  reviewed  showed  that  soot  from 
biodiesel,  and  more  generally,  from  oxygenated  fuels,  is  more 
reactive  than  soot  generated  from  diesel  fuels  [16,40,43–
45,58,59,80,83,104,106,121,124,129,133,206,209,210] .  As  shown  in 
Section 1.2.1, soot from oxygenated fuels usually has a lower aver- 
age primary particle size than soot from non-oxygenated fuels. This 
characteristic is inversely related to both the soot surface area and 
the oxygen accessibility to the carbonaceous substrate and it can 
thus be related to soot reactivity. According to Song et al. [45,80] , 
the higher reactivity from biodiesel soot in comparison to diesel 
soot could also be explained based on the higher concentration of 
oxygenated functionalities in biodiesel soot (carboxyl and lactone 
peaks were identiﬁed in the spectrum). According to their results, 
the initial oxygen groups on the soot surface play a more decisive 
role in reactivity than the initial nanostructure. The authors sug- 
gested that the oxygen groups in the surface are involved in the 
internal structural change observed at the beginning of oxidation. 
Soriano et al. [40] and Rodríguez-Fernández et al. [206] argued that 
organic materials and small traces of metal ashes, which are higher 
in biodiesel soot compared to diesel soot, may result in a higher 
oxidation reactivity. Yehliu et al. [59] observed that soot reactivity 
was well correlated with nanostructural parameters. Agudelo et al. 
[33] found that soot from different crude vegetable oils was more 
reactive than diesel soot. These authors argued that the presence of 
aliphatic groups on the soot surface was even more important than 
the presence of oxygenated groups in governing soot oxidation. 

The  effect  of  paraﬃnic  fuels  on  soot  reactivity  has  been 
evaluated  in  other  work.  According  to  [45,59,80]  soot  from 
Fischer-Tropsch  fuel  has  lower  reactivity  than  soot  from  diesel 
fuel. However, in [40,124,210] , the opposite trend was observed. Fi- 
nally, other investigators [44,124,210] observed that soot generated 
from  other  paraﬃnic  fuels  (HVO)  showed  more  reactivity  than 
diesel  soot,  although  Cadrazco  et  al.  [42]  observed  the  opposite 
trend, in line with [45,59,80] . 

In summary, the oxidation of soot in thermal analysis devices 
(thermo-gravimetric balance, mainly) is a direct measurement of 
the soot oxidative reactivity. Differently, the characterization tech- 
niques  discussed  in  previous  sections  evaluate  properties  of  the 
soot that may be involved in the mechanisms responsible for soot 
oxidation.  By  contrasting  the  results  in  the  present  and  former 
sections, it appears that the speciﬁc surface area available for ox- 
idation is a decisive parameter, while the occurrence of particular 
chemical functionalities or soot nanostructure may be less relevant. 
This is deduced from the wide agreement among authors on how 
smaller particle sizes and high porosities (responsible for internal 
burning modes in some soot samples) lead to higher reactivity. 

4.3. Soot oxidation kinetics from thermal characterization 

The estimation of kinetic parameters from the results provided 
by thermal analysis must be done with caution. The oxidation of 
a soot bed in a thermal analyzer involves both the kinetics of the 
occurring  chemical  reaction/s  and  the  effects  of  mass  and  heat 
transfer.  Depending  on  dimensions  and  experimental  conditions, 
the latter may be dominant, and the reaction is then referred to

as  diffusion-controlled.  If  kinetic  data  are  to  be  extracted  from 
a  thermal  experiment,  conditions  that  could  move  the  reaction 
towards  a  diffusion-controlled  regime  should  be  avoided.  From 
this perspective, slow temperature ramps (in non-isothermal tests) 
[206] , low sample mass [220] (though assuring the accuracy and 
repeatability of the results), or using pans whose shape and height 
do not hamper the oxygen diffusion [221–223] , are preferred. 

From the results obtained with thermal analysis techniques, the 
parameters associated to soot oxidation kinetics can be estimated, 
such as activation energy ( E a ), pre-exponential factor ( A ) and reac- 
tion rate constant ( k c ). The usual way to derive these parameters 
is ﬁtting the experimental data to an Arrhenius-type reaction, as 
follows Eqs. (7 ) and ( (8) ):

where  p O2  is  the  partial  pressure  of  oxygen,  T  is  the  absolute 
temperature, R is the gas constant, β is the heating rate, and f ( α) 
is a mathematical function that describes the reaction mechanism. 
To model solid-state reactions, different equations have been pro- 
posed in the literature. According to the mechanism that controls 
the reaction, these models are divided into nucleation, geometrical 
contraction, diffusion, or reaction-order ( Table 8 ) [204,224] . 

In  the  literature  [44,60,106,129] ,  the  activation  energy  is  the 
most  discussed  kinetic  parameter  and  the  authors  usually  re- 
late  this  parameter  to  soot  reactivity.  In  these  studies,  the  most 
widespread  interpretation  of  the  activation  energy  is  the  energy 
that  must  be  provided  to  the  soot  sample  in  order  to  start  the 
oxidation process. According to this interpretation, the lower the 
activation energy, the higher the oxidative reactivity of the soot. 
This  relationship  between  reactivity  and  activation  energy  could 
be equivocal, since the reaction rate constant depends on both the 
activation energy and the pre-exponential factor. For this reason, 
studies exclusively based on the activation energy inevitably result 
in misleading conclusions. A summary of the kinetic parameters 
obtained in different studies when soot is analyzed is shown in 
Table 9 . Despite the shortcomings noted above, results shown in 
Table 9 conﬁrm some of the conclusions from the work presented 
in Section 3.2 . For instance, results in [45] and [59] show a lower 
activation energy and a higher reaction rate (i.e. higher reactivity)

for  soybean-derived  biodiesel  compared  to  regular  diesel,  where 
the values for a 20% biodiesel content blend are between those for 
either pure fuel. As discussed earlier, this may be related to the 
smaller  size  of  the  primary  particles  (i.e.  higher  speciﬁc  surface 
area) with oxygenated fuels. Also, in [44,60] , the estimated kinetic 
parameters for soot from paraﬃnic fuels did not differ much from 
those  for  diesel  fuel,  which  is  consistent  with  the  discrepancies 
described  in  Section  4.2 .  Finally,  the  activation  energy  of  the 
oxidation  reaction  is  in  the  range  55–70  kJ/mol  for  NO 
2  and  in 
the range 10 0–20 0 kJ/mol for oxygen, which supports the larger 
effectiveness  of  NO 
2  as  a  soot  oxidant,  as  discussed  in  previous 
section. 

Table  9  shows  that  the  preferred  model  for  ﬁtting  the  ex- 
perimental  curves,  and  thus  deducing  the  oxidation  kinetic 
parameters,  is  the  ﬁrst-order  equation.  This  model  may  not  ac- 
curately  reproduce  the  soot  oxidation  process,  since  it  assumes 
that the reaction rate is proportional to the fraction remaining of 

reactants.  For  this  reason,  the  use  of  other  models,  such  as  the 
geometrical  contraction  models,  should  be  explored  to  evaluate 
their  potential  to  simulate  the  soot  oxidation  process.  Moreover, 
the complexity of soot oxidation (the experimental rate of reaction 
can exhibit two peaks [206] instead of one, even when the sample 
was devolatilized to avoid the artifacts derived from the presence 
of  water  and  hydrocarbons)  suggests  that  other  models  beyond 
those listed in Table 8 could be more appropriate, such as models 
that account for the growth and the opening of occluded pores or 
the appearance of active sites [236] . 

5. Implications on diesel particulate ﬁlters 

Engine manufacturers have adopted different solutions, such as 
the use of diesel particulate ﬁlters, to meet with the standards re- 
lated to emissions. These devices have been traditionally installed 
in conjunction with a DOC (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst). However, in

modern engines, due to the increasingly stringent standards, NO 
X 
aftertreatment systems like LNT (Lean NO 
X Trap) or SCR (Selective 
Catalytic Reduction) have been installed in the last years together 
with both DOC and DPF. Diesel particulate ﬁlters collect the soot 
formed  during  the  combustion  process  (i.e.  the  loading  process) 
and the soot collected is then oxidized in a regeneration process. 
Filter regeneration can be performed actively, mainly through late 
fuel injections in the combustion chamber, which increase the ex- 
haust temperature once the fuel is burnt in the DOC, or passively, 
with catalysts applied on the ﬁlter media to promote soot oxida- 
tion with NO 
2 , as described previously. The regeneration process 
is  strongly  inﬂuenced  by  different  factors  such  as  the  ﬂowrate, 
composition and temperature of the exhaust gases, the DPF char- 
acteristics and the soot physicochemical properties. This last factor 
plays  an  important  role  in  the  regeneration  process  and  it  has 
thus  received  signiﬁcant  attention  by  different  authors.  A  good 
understanding of these properties can help engine manufacturers 
design more eﬃcient regeneration processes, so that the different 
drawbacks associated with this process can be minimized. Some of 
these drawbacks are the penalization in fuel consumption (accord- 
ing to [14] , active regeneration costs about 2–3% fuel consumption, 
while  passive  regeneration  strategies  can  drop  this  penalty  by 
about  80%),  the  reduction  of  ﬁltering  eﬃciency  (Beatrice  et  al. 
[237]  reported  a  progressive  increase  in  the  particle  number 
measured downstream of the ﬁlter during the regeneration phase) 
and the reduction in lifetime of the particle ﬁlter. 

Traditionally,  regeneration  processes  have  been  classiﬁed  into 
active  and  passive  processes.  In  active  regeneration  processes, 
additional energy must be introduced to achieve suﬃcient temper- 
ature for soot oxidation. The use of post-injection is the most usual 
method  to  perform  this  type  of  regeneration  process,  although 
other methods (burners [238] , oxygen injection [239] , injector in 
the  exhaust  system  [240] ,  Throttle  Valve  Actuator  – TVA  [241] ) 
have also been used. In passive regeneration process, soot oxida- 
tion  temperature  is  lowered  by  means  of  a  formulated  catalyst, 
the  use  of  additives,  or  the  addition  of  nitrogen  dioxide  which, 
at low temperatures ( ≈350 °C, typical of the passive regeneration 
process),  is  a  more  active  oxidant  than  oxygen.  Nevertheless, 
most of the engine manufacturers use a combination of the two 
methods  above  described.  In  an  active-passive  regeneration  pro- 
cess, a catalyst-based ﬁlter is equipped with some kind of active 
regeneration system. 

Most of the studies have measured and discussed the particle or 
gaseous emissions during regeneration events [14,242,243] , but not 
many of them have evaluated the effect of soot characteristics on 
this process. Lapuerta et al. [244] modiﬁed different engine param- 
eters (injection timing, injection strategy, and EGR ratio) to assess 
their importance in the regeneration process. In this investigation, 
soot properties were not evaluated, but in some cases, results were 
linked with soot characteristics. According to the results presented, 
the rate of regeneration increases as the EGR ratio decreases. Al- 
though these authors explained that the oxygen concentration is 
a primary factor governing DPF regeneration, soot reactivity was 
proven  to  have  an  important  impact  on  this  process  as  well.  In 
line with this study, Liati et al. [245] evaluated the soot charac- 
teristics along the exhaust aftertreatment system, since the formed 
particles  are  susceptible  to  modiﬁcations  of  their  characteristics 
within the exhaust system, and speciﬁcally in the DPF. Among the 
results  presented  by  these  investigators,  it  is  observed  that  the 
nanostructure of soot collected downstream of the DPF during the 
regeneration process exhibits a higher degree of order than soot 
collected upstream or soot collected downstream but under non- 
regenerating  conditions.  This  means  that  only  particles  with  the 
highest degree of order can survive a regeneration process. In an- 
other  study,  Liati  et  al.  [246]  evaluated  soot  deposited  in  a  DPF 
during different loading and regeneration processes. These authors 

suggested that biodiesel soot nanostructure resulted in a higher re- 
activity, although no results from thermal analysis were shown. 

The effect of the type of fuel in the regeneration process has 
also  been  studied.  The  most  accepted  trend  in  the  literature  is 
that when the engine is running with biodiesel, or with biodiesel 
blends, the regeneration process is faster than with diesel fuel or 
paraﬃnic fuels [15,45,80,121] . Rodríguez-Fernández et al. [15] ob- 
served that soot generated from animal fat biodiesel has a higher 
surface  area  than  those  from  diesel  fuel.  This  could  be  related 
to reactivity, since as the soot surface area increases, the oxygen 
accessibility  to  the  carbonaceous  matrix  is  expected  to  increase. 
On the other hand, Song et al. [80] argued that the surface oxygen 
groups  are  more  important  than  the  structure  or  pore  size  dis- 
tribution, since they provide the means for more rapid oxidation 
and drastic structural transformation during the oxidation process. 
Furthermore, Song et al. [80] and Boehman et al. [121] explained 
that biodiesel soot may undergo a capsule type oxidation different 
from diesel fuel or Fischer-Tropsch fuel, which enhances the rate of 
soot oxidation. Finally, in [16] , a trend opposite to that described 
above was observed, i.e., regeneration process was faster when the 
engine  was  running  with  diesel  fuel  instead  of  biodiesel.  These 
authors  explained  that  the  lower  exhaust  temperature  obtained 
with  biodiesel  (approximately  40  °C  lower  than  for  diesel)  was 
responsible  for  this  result,  which  stands  in  contrast  to  results 
obtained in the TGA analysis (where soot from biodiesel was more 
reactive  than  diesel  soot).  Although  the  studies  by  Rodríguez- 
Fernández et al. [15] and Lapuerta et al. [16] were performed in 
the  same  experimental  installation,  these  investigators  obtained 
opposite  trends.  In  [15] ,  the  authors  explained  that  the  lower 
difference  in  exhaust  temperature  of  biodiesel  with  respect  to 
diesel  fuel  (30  °C  approximately)  compared  to  that  obtained 
by  Lapuerta  et  al.  [16]  (60  °C)  was  not  suﬃcient  to  get  diesel 
regeneration closer to biodiesel regeneration. To achieve the same 
regeneration temperature with diesel and biodiesel fuels, Di Iorio 
et al. [247] re-calibrated the regeneration strategy to increase the 
fuel mass rate in the post-injections when biodiesel was used as 
fuel. However, these authors did not compare the duration of the 
regeneration process nor the pressure drop evolution. 

In [15,45] , the regeneration process with paraﬃninc fuels was 
found to be similar to that with diesel fuel. This result contrasts 
with the ﬁndings of these authors when using the thermogravi- 
metric  analyzer.  While  Song  et  al.  [45]  found  that  soot  from  a 
Fischer-Tropsch fuel was less reactive than diesel soot, Rodríguez- 
Fernández  et  al.  [15]  observed  the  opposite  trend  when  HVO 
and  GTL  fuels  were  analyzed.  In  [15] ,  the  discrepancy  between 
the results obtained in the regeneration process and in the TGA 
was  explained  through  NO x  emissions,  which  were  lower  with 
paraﬃnic fuels than with diesel fuel. As explained in Section 3.2 , 
as NO x emissions increase, the oxidation process is enhanced. 

In other investigations, the DPF loading process has been stud- 
2 concentration in 
ied. This process is highly inﬂuenced by the NO 
the exhaust gases, the fuel used, and the soot reactivity. Bhardwaj 
et  al.  [44]  studied  the  DPF  loading  process  with  three  different 
fuels  (diesel,  HVO  and  rapeseed  biodiesel).  In  this  investigation, 
the loading process was found to be faster when the engine was 
running  with  diesel  fuel  compared  to  other  fuels.  Although  not 
said  explicitly,  the  higher  reactivity  of  HVO  and  biodiesel  (mea- 
sured with TGA), together with the lower particle emissions from 
these fuels, could explain this trend. Similar results were found in 
Rodríguez-Fernández et al. [15] , who observed that paraﬃnic and 
biodiesel fuels were the  only  ones  that  achieved the break-even 
temperature (BET) in the DPF loading process (i.e., the temperature 
at which soot accumulation balances soot oxidation in the DPF). 
Likely explaining this result are the higher NO 
2 emissions observed 
with these fuels, whose reactivity towards soot is much higher at 
low temperatures (150 °C–300 °C) [248] , the higher reactivity of 

26 

M. Lapuerta, J. Rodríguez–Fernández and J. Sánchez-Valdepeñas / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 78 (2020) 100833 

soot from these fuels and the lower particulate emissions of HVO, 
GTL, and biodiesel with respect to diesel fuel. 

According to the results shown in this section, it can be con- 
cluded that soot reactivity has an important effect on the loading 
and  regeneration  processes  that  take  place  in  the  DPF,  although 
other  factors,  such  as  the  exhaust  temperature  or  the  exhaust 
gas  composition  also  play  an  important  role.  A  more  reactive 
soot decreases the duration of the regeneration process. For this 
reason, the penalty in the fuel consumption associated with the 
post-injection, which is needed to carry out the active regenera- 
tion  process,  could  be  reduced.  Speciﬁcally,  in  [15] ,  the  authors 
observed that fuel consumption in the regeneration process with 
animal fat biodiesel was 5 % lower than that obtained with diesel 
fuel.  The  higher  reactivity  of  biodiesel  soot  in  comparison  with 
diesel soot could partially explain this result. On the other hand, 
the  length  of  the  regeneration  process  also  has  some  effect  on 
the dilution of fuel in the lubricant oil in the engine sump [249] . 
During the late post-injection used in the regeneration process (at 
the end of the expansion stroke and during exhaust stroke), a thin 
ﬁlm of fuel can build up on the cylinder walls causing lubricant 
degradation  [250] .  This,  in  turn,  may  lead  to  a  more  frequent 
need for oil draining and engine maintenance [16,249] . Finally, in 
[251] , it was found that during the DPF loading process, the fuel 
consumption increased 4% as the DPF load increased up to 80 hPa. 
This  ﬁnding  shows  that  the  use  of  fuels  with  lower  particulate 
matter emissions or fuels that promote the formation of a more 
reactive  soot  leads  to  a  lower  fuel  consumption  in  the  loading 
process. Furthermore, as the duration of loading process increases, 
the lapse between two regeneration events increases, which has 
beneﬁcial implications for the DPF lifetime, and the oil degradation 
time. 

6. Conclusions 

In general, a wide disparity among available results has been 
found  in  the  reviewed  body  of  work,  making  it  diﬃcult  to  dis- 
cern  a  dominant  trend.  Some  reasons  have  been  discussed  to 
explain  these  discrepancies,  such  as  the  complexity  of  some  of 
the techniques, the heterogeneity of soot and some of its inherent 
properties  (e.g.  the  high  capacity  of  absorb  radiation).  Never- 
theless,  in  some  cases,  it  has  been  possible  to  ﬁnd  results  from 
different authors that point in the same direction: 

As  a  rule,  results  obtained  from  the  structural  analysis  tech- 
niques (e.g. XRD, Raman spectroscopy and HRTEM) showed that as 
engine load increases, soot nanostructure becomes more ordered. 
The higher in-cylinder temperature may contribute to organization 
of the soot nanostructure into more ordered layers, as reported by 
Griﬃth and Marsh in their conceptual model. 

Those  researchers  who  studied  the  effect  of  fuel  on  the  soot 
nanostructure, have concluded that soot from biodiesel fuels shows 
a more ordered nanostructure and lower primary particle size than 
soot from diesel fuel. Both effects, which could contribute oppo- 
sitely to soot reactivity, are explained based on the intramolecular 
oxygen in biodiesel fuel. On the one hand, oxygen plays an evident 
role in the oxidation process of the graphitic layers, favoring the 
formation  of  a  more  ordered  nanostructure.  On  the  other  hand, 
oxygen acts as oxidant agent and inhibits soot precursors, leading 
to a reduction in the size and number of soot particles. 

The results from chemical analysis techniques are more obscure 
and  data  from  different  sources  are  often  contradictory.  Most 
authors  report  qualitative  results  about  the  presence  of  speciﬁc 
functional  groups  on  the  soot  surface,  and  they  may  also  con- 
jecture how the presence of one or more functionalities may be 
related to the soot reactivity. Generally, the spectra obtained with 
chemical analysis techniques show poorly deﬁned or overlapping 
peaks, leading to inaccuracies in interpretation. Therefore, the cur- 

rent challenge for a successful application of chemical techniques 
to  soot  analysis  is  to  improve  the  resolution  of  the  spectra.  In 
the  meantime,  using  a  previous  chemical  derivatization  reaction 
(only marginally used so far) or applying new and more accurate 
techniques, may be promising paths. 

Regarding  the  results  obtained  with  thermal  analysis  tech- 
niques,  it  has  been  observed  that  soot  from  biodiesel  fuels,  and 
more  generally,  from  oxygenated  fuels,  exhibits  higher  reactivity 
than  soot  from  diesel  fuels.  In  addition,  thermal  experiments 
conﬁrm that the oxidant atmosphere plays a decisive role in the 
oxidation  process.  According  to  different  studies,  the  reactivity 
of  NO 
2  towards  soot  is  far  higher  than  that  of  oxygen  at  low 
temperatures (in the range of 200 °C–400 °C, approximately), as it 
has been proven in real operation of particle ﬁlters. 

As  shown  in  this  review,  a  large  body  of  work  propose  re- 
lationships  between  soot  reactivity  and  results  obtained  from 
just one or a few soot analysis techniques. The conclusions from 
such  investigations  may  not  be  accurate,  since  there  is  not  a 
comprehensive picture of the soot characteristics and properties. 
It is always possible that other properties that were not measured 
could  have  a  more  prominent  effect  on  the  oxidative  reactivity 
of  soot.  This  suggests  the  necessity  for  carrying  out  a  complete 
characterization  of  soot  at  different  levels,  including  nano  and 
microstructure,  morphology,  porosity,  surface  area,  functional 
groups  in  the  soot  structure,  and  composition  of  hydrocarbons 
that  will  eventually  be  adsorbed.  Nevertheless,  the  importance 
of the adsorbed hydrocarbons on reactivity is limited, since most 
hydrocarbons are removed from the soot surface at typical exhaust 
temperatures. 

Among  all  the  properties  of  soot  that  could  be  related  to 
its  oxidative  reactivity,  the  extent  of  surface  area  accessible  for 
oxidant  species  has  been  revealed  as  critical,  as  it  happens  on 
solid-gas reactions. Thus, parameters like soot porosity or size of 
the primary particles usually correlate well with reactivity results 
obtained by thermal analysis experiments. 

In  some  cases,  the  reviewed  work  did  not  perform  enough 
replications of the measured soot properties. For this reason, it is 
not  possible  to  apply  statistical  procedures  to  assess  the  signiﬁ- 
cance of the results or to discern which of the soot characteristics 
correlate better with its reactivity. Nevertheless, different studies 
show  a  good  agreement  between  soot  reactivity,  measured  with 
the  thermal  analysis  techniques,  and  the  size  of  the  primary 
particles. This characteristic is closely related to the soot surface 
area, and thus to the soot surface exposed to the different oxidant 
agents involved in the oxidation process. 

Finally,  in  the  last  section  of  this  review,  the  results  about 
the regeneration process in the diesel particulate ﬁlter are men- 
tioned.  Most  of  the  studies  reviewed  show  a  good  agreement 
between  the  results  obtained  from  thermal  analysis  techniques 
and in the regeneration process. For this reason, thermal analysis 
for  studying  soot  reactivity  emerges  as  a  powerful  tool,  which 
increases the interest in the use of such techniques. Besides, these 
instruments  are  simple,  ﬂexible  and  available  in  most  research 
centers. 

Ultimately,  all  the  results  provided  by  these  different  tech- 
niques,  even  if  they  do  not  show  a  complete  overview  of  soot 
reactivity,  contribute  to  enhancing the  knowledge of  soot  mech- 
anisms  not  only  during  the  ﬁlter  regeneration,  but  also  during 
the  previous  inception-growth-collisions-agglomeration-oxidation 
processes in the combustion chamber.

State University (United States) under a pre-doc program to study diesel particle 
size  distributions.  Later,  in  20 08-20 09,  he  occupied  a  postdoc  position  at  the 
Power Systems Engine Group of University of Birmingham (UK) to work on dual 
combustion, fuel reforming and nitrogen oxide aftertreatment. He has evaluated 3 
doctoral theses, presented more than 20 contributions in conferences, published 
40 JCR research articles and collaborated in 12 publicly-ﬁnanced projects and more 
than 40 projects with private automotive fuel companies. He is reviewer for various 
journals and member of the Spanish Biodiesel Technical Committee from APPA 
since 2010.

is  researcher  at  the  University  of  Castilla-La  Mancha 
(UCLM, Spain) and a member of the Fuels and Engines 
Group since 2012. His investigation has been focused on 
emissions from diesel engines, speciﬁcally in the study 
of diesel soot. He has also worked in other ﬁelds such 
as fuel characterization. At present he has published 12 
scientiﬁc articles in international journals (ﬁve of which 
are focused on soot characterization with different analy- 
sis techniques) and collaborated in 2 public projects and 
more than 15 projects with private companies in the au- 
tomotive and fuel sectors.

Previously, he was assistant professor at the University 
Politécnica de Valencia, also in Spain. He has led the Fu- 
els and Engines Group since its foundation in 1996. The 
research lines of this group are mainly focused on diesel 
combustion and emissions, with particular attention to 
the effect of the use of residual and renewable fuels from 
different feedstocks on the engine gaseous and particu- 
late emissions. He spent a sabbatical year in the Penn- 
sylvania State University, USA (2010–2011), another half- 
sabbatical at the Combustion Research Laboratory (Uni- 
versity  of  Toronto,  Canada),  and  a  six-month  stage  in 
CETAM (Centro de Tecnologías Ambientales, Valparaíso, Chile). He has advised 14 
doctoral theses, presented more than 80 congresses, published 130 scientiﬁc arti- 
cles in international journals, collaborated with around 60 companies in the area 
of fuels and engines and received funds from 25 competitive projects from institu- 
tions. He was awarded with the prize from Castilla-La Mancha government to the 
technological innovation in 2005. He is member of the Spanish Scientiﬁc Committee 
for standardization in Fuels and Lubricants (AENOR) and of the Biofuels Committee 
from the Spanish Association of Renewable Energy Producers (APPA).

José
Fernández  is  Assistant  Professor  at  the  University  of 
Castilla-La  Mancha  (UCLM,  Spain)  since  2011  and  a 
member  of  the  Fuels  and  Engines  Group  since  2003. 
From the beginning of his career, his research has been 
focused  on  1)  diesel  combustion  and  diesel  engine 
performance and emissions, and 2) the effect of fueling 
diesel  engines  and  vehicles  with  renewable  and  other 
alternative  fuels  (biodiesel,  e-diesel,  hydrotreated  veg- 
etable oil or Fischer-Tropsch fuels, among others). More 
recently,  he  has  studied  diesel  aftertreatment  devices, 
with  one  thesis  advised  (and  two  more  in  progress) 
on this topic. In 2006, he stayed three months at Penn
