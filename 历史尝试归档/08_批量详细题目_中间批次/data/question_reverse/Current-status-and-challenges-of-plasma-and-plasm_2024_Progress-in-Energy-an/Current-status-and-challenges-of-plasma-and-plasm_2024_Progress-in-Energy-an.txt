Non-thermal plasma appears as a promising alternative technology to develop the electrification of the petro-
chemical  industry.  Non-thermal  plasma  has  the  advantage  of  operating  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  room
temperature in “on/off” mode. The high-energy electrons generated are able to activate many reactants allowing
thermodynamically unfavorable reactions to occur. Methane coupling is particularly important to produce C2
hydrocarbons,  especially  ethylene  known  as  a  platform  chemical  for  the  synthesis  of  many  products.  In  this
review, the state-of-the-art of plasma and plasma-catalysis for methane coupling is described. Focus is given on
plasma chemistry and the influence of different parameters related to plasma reactors and gas composition are
discussed. The role of a catalyst coupled with plasma is detailed and synergies are explained for various catalytic
compositions.

1. Introduction

Light olefins are key components in our societies that are in constant
demand for chemicals to produce modern consumer goods. The Inter-
national Energy Agency reported, in 2018, that petrochemical demand
will  consume  an  additional  56  billion  cubic  meters  of  natural  gas  by
2030, increasing to 83 bcm by 2050 [1]. Seven primary petrochemicals
(ammonia,  methanol,  ethylene,  propylene,  benzene,  toluene,  and  xy-
lenes) provide the key building blocks on which most of the chemical
industry  is  based.  The  global  demand  for  ethylene,  one  of  the  target
products for the plastic industry, was estimated to be 185 million tons in
2022  [2].  As  an  alternative  process  to  naptha  steam  cracking,  the
possible production of ethylene from the direct conversion of methane
has led to vigorous industrial and academic research. However, the low
natural gas price is currently not sufficient to overcome the process’s
high costs. A recent techno-economic analysis of the oxidative coupling
of methane reported that to be competitive, the process must achieve at
least 25–30% C2 yield to reach an ethylene cost below 1000 €/ton [3].
Considering the foreseen prices of oil and natural gas, combined with the
development of efficient technologies for direct methane conversion, the
process should become economically viable in around 20 years. In the

range of nascent technologies, catalysis coupled to electro, photo and
non-thermal  plasma  methane  activation  are  the  most  widely  investi-
gated to offer reliable alternatives to traditional processes.

The attempts to break the methane C–H bond and lower its activation
barrier energy using catalysts have led to the report of promising results.
In  fact,  different  catalytic  processes  involving  a  direct  conversion  of
methane  to  C2,  such  as  the  oxidative  coupling  [4–9]  and  the
non-oxidative coupling of methane [10–14] have been published in the
literature. The thermal catalytic processes result in C2 yields up to 25%
with low selectivity, mainly due to catalysts’ surface contamination by
carbon. In the context of high carbon dioxide emissions, the decarbon-
ization  of  the  chemical  industry  is  a  subject  of  great  interest  and  the
electrification of the petrochemical industry is at the center of extensive
research  work.  Catalysis  coupled  to  electro,  photo  and  non-thermal
plasma  has  the  advantage  of  being  non-thermal  through  electrical
activation,  where  the  presence  of  an  electric  field  promotes  surface
charges and their diffusion [15,16]. Furthermore, the low temperature
reduces coke deposition, catalyst deactivation, and favors selectivity to
products that would degrade under thermal activation. One advantage
of non-thermal plasma resides in its reactivity zone, which is not limited
to the contact surface of the electrodes (2D-like process) but is extended
to the complete reactor volume as in thermal catalysis (3D-like process).

Additionally,  plasma  can  activate  gases  readily  with  just  an  on/off
switch and thus can be adapted to time-varying renewable energy pro-
duction. In this context, C2 production from methane using non-thermal
plasma is investigated as the process could become economically viable
with the decrease in electricity prices [17]. Non-thermal plasmas are at
non-thermodynamic equilibrium, where electrons can reach an average
temperature  of  1–10  eV  (~104–105  K)  and  surrounding  gas  remains
close to ambient. Ionization processes are determined by the electrons’
energy and lead to reactive free radicals, metastable and excited state
atoms that rapidly undergo several chemical reactions [18,19]. When a
high voltage is applied between two electrodes, an intense electric field
is generated and the free electrons in the gas are accelerated. They will
collide with the surrounding molecules and will give rise to ionization
and excitation reactions, creating an electron avalanche, which leads to
the propagation of a discharge and the formation of the plasma.

Various plasma processes have been proposed as alternative tools for
methane  conversion  [20,21].  It  was  suggested  that  an  appropriate
design of discharge reactors can modify and improve the selectivity to
the  desired  products.  Different  types  of  plasma  such  as  corona  [14,
22–24], glidarc discharge [25–27], dielectric barrier discharge [28–31],
micro  DBD  [32,33]  and  microwave  plasmas  [34,35]  were  developed.
Dielectric barrier discharge is one of the most extensively investigated
types of reactor. DBD, also called silent discharges, are generated be-
tween two electrodes of various shapes, e.g. planar, cylindrical or tip and
are separated by an insulating material (dielectric barrier) made either
of glass, quartz or ceramics. The dielectric allows plasma diffusion in the
whole  discharge  volume  by  dispersing  the  micro-filaments  over  the
electrode  surface.  The  dielectric  surface  charging  reduces  the  field
strength in the gap, preventing an arc formation after the breakdown.
Various factors will affect the total charge transferred in a discharge,
such as the gas properties, the discharge gap and the properties of the
dielectric  [21,36].  Among  the  advantages  of  DBD  plasma  reactors,
scalability and ease of maintaining the non-thermal plasma offer good
control  of  the  process  [21].  However,  the  principal  disadvantages  of
DBD are the lack of homogeneity and the high energy cost. Even if, to the
eye, it seems that all the gas in the inter-electrode space is ionized, this is
not the case in practice. High-speed camera images show that the plasma
is  made  up  of  very  fine  streamers  (small  gas  threads).  Moreover,  the
presence  of  a  dielectric  requires  the  use  of  alternating  voltage  with
relatively high frequencies to avoid surface charging and extinction of
the plasma. Any materials subject to alternating current will heat up and
a non-negligible part of the injected power will not be used to generate
plasma but will be lost upon heating.

Despite the large number of publications in this field, the C2 yield in
the methane coupling in plasma remains low (below 40%), due to the
high electron energy requirements to trigger ionization reactions [21].
Since advances in improving product selectivity are essential, the com-
bination  of  non-thermal  plasma  with  a  catalyst  was  proposed,  as
described  in  “The  2020  plasma  catalysis  roadmap”  [16].  Coupling

catalysis to plasma can enhance the process in a manner that cannot be
achieved by plasma alone or by catalysis, separately. There are two ways
in which plasma and catalyst can be configured: either the catalyst is
placed  in  the  plasma  discharge  (IPC),  or  in  the  post-discharge  (PPC).
Some  types  of plasma  reactors present particular  difficulties  in incor-
porating the catalyst directly in the discharge region (e.g. gliding arc).
The  dielectric  barrier  discharge  plasma  is,  once  again,  one  of  the
most studied systems due to its configuration, facilitating the filling of
the  volume  with  catalyst  particles.  How  the  catalytic  materials  are
introduced  in  the  plasma  plays  an  important  role  in  determining  the
nature of the plasma–catalyst interaction. When the catalyst is placed
into the discharge volume, the electrons, ions, radicals and all the other
plasma  species  will  activate  the  catalyst,  depending  on  its  chemical
nature and electrical properties. In the case of a post-discharge catalyst,
only  the  long-lived  species  and  stable  intermediates  will  reach  the
catalyst [37]. In the same time, the catalyst in the plasma volume act as a
dielectric material, reducing the gap width of the reactor and, conse-
quently, enhancing the electric field strength and electron temperature
[38].

The main benefit of combining plasma and a catalyst is the resulting
synergistic effect: the whole process’s performance is higher than both
processes taken separately [37]. This synergistic effect comes with its
share of issues as questions remain in assessing the benefits associated
with the plasma versus those coming from the catalyst [39]. Moreover,
the catalyst is not left unscathed by the plasma impact. Plasma changes
the chemical and electronic properties of a surface [39,40]. For example,
in  the  field  of  catalyst  synthesis,  non-thermal  plasma  treatment  can
enhance the stability and activity of catalysts [41]. Plasma activation
can improve nanoparticle dispersion on surfaces, reduce particle sizes
and strengthen the metal support interaction. Based on published work,
Table 1 briefly summarizes the plasma catalytic interactions at stake in
the process.

If these synergistic effects showed improvements in terms of reactant
conversion and energy efficiency, the process still suffers from technical
issues. Coke formation remains a problem as it deactivates the catalyst

and reduces the plasma discharge to its neutralization. In addition, the
plasma electric field influences the catalyst surface in terms of surface
diffusion. The electron impact alters the surface, which may create de-
fects, thus modifying the catalyst’s active phase and lowering its reac-
tivity [21].

The  review  aims  to  evaluate  the  current  state  of  the  art  in  the
coupling of methane by plasma alone and plasma-catalysis, with a focus
on the effect of the reaction conditions and fixed parameters. The first
part is dedicated to sole plasma and is presented in two sections on the
non-oxidative and oxidative coupling of methane. The plasma chemistry
is first described, followed by the description of the influence of different
parameters. The effects of added gases such as N2, H2 and noble gases, as
well as the effects of oxidants (oxygen, carbon dioxide and water) on the
reaction are reported. In the second part, the coupling of plasma with
catalysis is described with a focus on the chemistry at the surface of the
material. The effects of catalyst particle size, shape and dielectric con-
stant are reported.

2. Plasma-alone for non- and oxidative coupling of methane

2.1. Plasma-alone for the non-oxidative coupling of methane

One  approach  for  the  plasma  valorization  of  methane  in  the  non-
oxidative  conversion  consisted  in  feeding  pure  methane  into  the
plasma  zone.  Some  studies  also  investigated  the  addition  of  non-
oxidative  gases  (noble  gases,  hydrogen  or  nitrogen)  in  the  methane
effluent. The nature and distribution of products depend on the reaction
parameters  (specific  energy  input,  type  of  plasma  reactor,  gap,  tem-
perature, pressure and residence time) which are also interrelated. The
main products reported in the literature are acetylene, ethylene, ethane,
hydrogen,  carbon  and higher  hydrocarbons in  much smaller  amounts
[21].

(Table 2), while heterogeneous reactions will occur between the plasma-
activated  species  and  the  catalyst  surface  [18].  These  reactions  are
mainly valid for atmospheric pressure plasma (and above) where par-
ticle recombination takes place.

As described in diverse publications (non-exhaustive list [20,21,26,
43–47]),  most  of  the  energy  is  spent  producing  electrons  that  are
accelerated in the electric field to form high-energy electrons. Electron
impact reactions depend on the electron energy distribution function (or
electron temperature) and the electron collisional cross-section areas of
a  molecule.  The  electron  energy  is  controlled  by  the  reduced  electric
(cid:0) 1), divided
field strength, E/N. It is defined by the electric field (E, V cm
by the gas number density (N, cm

(cid:0) 3).
Vibrational  excitation  will  happen  with  low  energy  electrons

CH3, CH2, CH and H radicals will be produced from the electron’s
inelastic collisions with the methane molecules, at higher electron en-
ergy.  The  following  mechanism  for  methane  decomposition  reaction

A 1D fluid model was developed for a cylindrical DBD plasma with
pure  methane.  The  simulation  showed  that  methane  activation  starts
mainly  with  the  radical  reaction  (3)  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  methane
ionization (7) and (8) [49]. The radical reaction (3) is responsible for
79% of the total electronic dissociation of methane, while the reaction
(4) accounts for 15% and (5) for 5%. Methane ionization (7) accounts for
66% and (8) for 33%. The recombination (and dissociation) reactions to
various hydrocarbons were also depicted in their model. They did not
take the vibrational excitation into account despite their importance, as
they were only seen as energy loss reactions for the electrons. In their
numerical simulation, Nozaki et al. [45] reported similar fragmentation
patterns (CH3, CH2, CH and C) in pure methane using a microscale DBD
plasma  reactor  and  showed  their  dependence  on  the  reduced  electric
field. From the simulated time evolution of a streamer, they showed that
the  density  of  the  CH3  radical  was  dominant.  Methane  hydrogen
+
ion helped to produce methyl radicals. Ethane was
abstraction by CH4
the main product because coupling of methyl radicals is most likely to
occur. From a simulated fragmentation pattern as a function of external
electric field, the author showed that fragmentation into methyl radicals
is maximum (60%) at an electric field of 80 Td, which corresponds to the
breakdown field of methane. As the electric field increased (up to 500
Td), methane fragmentation pattern shifted from CH3  radicals to CH2,
CH and C, affecting the final product distribution.

2.1.2.

Influence of the plasma type and reactor geometry

Many efforts have been made on the plasma type and reactor design
in order to improve efficiency in methane coupling reaction, yielding
different  performances  in  terms  of  conversion,  energy cost  and  selec-
tivity towards hydrocarbons.

AC and pulsed discharges: They are the most common sources in the
non-oxidative  methane  reaction  as  their  low  temperatures  might  be
favorable for some reactions, due to their thermodynamics. Experiments
using pure methane as a feed gas are resumed in Table 3. In the case of
pulsed discharges, methane conversion is generally superior to 20% at
(cid:0) 1), while in the case of
very low specific energy input (SEI <1.44 kJ L
AC discharges, conversions superior to 20% are achieved at much higher
(cid:0) 1. The product selectivities are highly
SEI, varying from 25 to 150 kJ L
dependent  on  the  plasma  source:  very  high  selectivities  of  acetylene
obtained in the pulse discharges as compared to AC discharges, where
ethane is predominant. The generation of plasma from pulsed excitation
ensures  very  high  instantaneous  energy  and  reduced  electric  field  to
produce highly energetic electrons promoting methane conversion, as
well as acetylene and ethylene products [50].

Spark discharges: When comparing pulsed corona and pulsed spark
discharges, Kangjun et al. [51] observed a methane conversion of 36.8%
for corona against 60.2% for spark discharges. This effect was related to
higher  electron  energy  in  spark  than  in  corona  pulsed  discharges.  In
spark discharge, C2 selectivity was 93.1% which included 95% of acet-
ylene. C2  selectivity with the pulsed corona discharge was only 59.2%
including  58.3%  of  acetylene.  Kado  et  al.  [52]  showed  that  indepen-
dently of the reactant (methane, ethane, ethylene or propane), acetylene
was  the  major  reaction  product  in  a  pulsed  spark  discharge.  From
emission spectroscopy and isotope exchange reactions, they concluded
that the very high electron density due to strong current (40 A) in short
time (500 ns) of the spark contributed to the successive dehydrogenation
of methane to CH3, CH2, CH radicals up to atomic carbon and hydrogen.
They also reported that carbon recombination into C2  and hydrogena-
tion into CH radicals would be high, promoting ethylene formation.

Reactor  geometry:  The  performance  of  two  reactor  geometries,
namely  coaxial  and  plate-to-plate,  using  CH4:  H2  = 1:1  mixture
(Table  3b)  [53]  was  compared  using  nanosecond  pulsed  discharge.
Methane conversion was favored in the coaxial configuration (45%) due
to the higher energy channeling into the discharge, i.e. higher electron
density and greater ionization rates, compared to plate-to-plate (35%),
while the selectivity of the products (acetylene, ethylene and ethane)
were  not  impacted.  The  authors  attributed  the  differences  in  perfor-
mance between the two reactors to the heating effects. The low reactor
mass  and  stainless-steel  cylindrical  ground  electrode  of  the  coaxial
reactor  resulted  in  limited  heat  loss,  thus  thermal-driven  cracking  of
methane was added to the electron impact. On the other hand, the high
heat capacity of the plate-to-plate reactor resulted in greater heat loss
and therefore, lower bulk gas temperature and lower methane conver-
the
sion.  Nevertheless,

energy-to-chemicals  transfer  occurred  at  a  lower  energy  cost  in
plate-to-plate geometry, while the substantial amount of energy in the
coaxial one was dissipated into gas heating. The reactor geometry affects
the  gas  velocity  and  temperature  within  the  discharge  zone  and  thus
methane conversion. However, C2 selectivity was not altered in the re-
ported publications.

Modelling:  Adding  up  to  experimental  investigations,  numerical
simulation of the reaction kinetics of a spark discharge at atmospheric
pressure showed that accumulated CH2 radicals in the discharge channel
react very rapidly with hydrogen radicals to form CH radicals (CH2  +
• + H2),  precursors  in  the  formation  of  acetylene  [54].  Such

reactivity is also linked to the temperature of spark discharges, which
are  considered  warm  plasmas  (103–104  ◦
C)  as  compared  to  DBD  and
corona which are cold plasmas (ambient temperatures up to 500

C).

In their studies using a 0D modeling approach, Heijkers et al. [55]
gave possible reaction pathways of methane conversion into hydrocar-
bons  (i.e. acetylene, ethylene and ethane)  and hydrogen,  in  a DBD, a
microwave and a gliding arc plasma. They compared their calculated
and  experimental  results  according  to  fixed  conditions  and  obtained
satisfactory correlations between them. Additionally, they highlighted
the  beneficial  effect  of  temperature  on  methane  conversion  in  the
gliding  arc  and  in  atmospheric  pressure  microwave  plasmas.  In  both
cases,  neutral  dissociation  and  dehydrogenation  processes  of  the  hy-
drocarbons  take  place,  forming  acetylene,  hydrogen,  and,  to  a  lesser
extent,  ethylene.  In  cases  of  DBD  and  reduced  pressure  microwave
plasmas, dissociation by electron impact and three-body recombination
processes occurred, creating more saturated compounds. Ethane was the
main product, but other hydrocarbons were detected such as propane

and butane.

2.1.3.

Influence of the gap

Using a repetitive nanosecond pulsed plasma and by varying the gap
from 3 to 8 mm width, Lotfalipour et al. [63] showed that 5 mm was the
optimal gap for methane conversion in their process (Table 4). However,
only small variations in selectivities to C2–C6 with the electrode spacing
were  observed.  The  distance  between  the  two  electrodes  impacts  the
plasma by modifying the average electron energy and reduced electric
field, which drops with increased gap width. Despite the mean electron
energy  decrease,  the  authors  suggested  the  importance  of  vibrational
excitation reactions, reactions (1) and (2), and low momentum transfer
cross section at a mean electron energy of around 0.3 eV to improve the
conversion process. They concluded on the difficulty to relate average
electron energy to conversion efficiencies when modifying the electrode
gap because it also altered the pulse energy. Beloqui et al. [14] reported
a maximum methane conversion with an electrode gap between 5 and 7
mm. At longer distances, the electric discharge would weaken or not be
generated. The author concluded that in the case of electrodes having
different geometries, not only the length but also the shape of the plasma
volume  changed  with  the  electrode  gap,  resulting,  in  some  cases,  in
variations in the product distribution, but without further investigation.
In a  gliding arc reactor [26],  methane conversion rate and  C2  hy-
drocarbon yield increased with the electrode gap distance from 2 to 4
mm. However, higher voltages were needed for larger gaps and over 4
mm, the discharge was unstable.

In the recent work by Delikonstantis et al. [53], using a plate-to-plate
configuration  and  nanosecond  pulses  of  various  frequencies,  the

V. Maslova et al.

optimum gap range for methane conversion was between 2.5 and 3.5
mm. At 3 kHz, the selectivity of acetylene reached a maximum at a 2.5
mm gap. At 10 kHz, acetylene selectivity was not only stable over the
range of 2.5–3.5 mm but was also improved when compared to 3 kHz
due to a higher concentration of active species with a longer lifetime.
The  greatest  yield  of  acetylene  in  this  range  was  due  to  the  efficient
load-impedance matching and subsequent high energy in the plasma.

The authors also observed several types of plasma regimes generated
with different gaps. The spark regime (in the range of 2–3.5 mm) was the
most advised for efficient plasma performances. At spark regime, cor-
responding  to  a  high  energy  regime  in  the  discharge,  methane  was
cracked  into  C  and  C2  via  an  electron-impact  reaction  (confirmed  by
optical  emission  spectroscopy),  generating  acetylene  via  stepwise  C2
hydrogenation and leaving a high carbon content. At lower gaps (≤3
mm), even when a spark regime was generated, the discharge did not
propagate into streamers because of the reduced space. As a result, high
bulk  temperature  and  low  energy  input  promoted  methane  thermal
cracking  into  CH3,  forming  ethane  via  CH3  coupling,  and  further
resulting  in  acetylene  via  stepwise  ethane  dehydrogenation.  Note-
worthy, lower carbon deposition was produced in this case. At greater
gaps,  the  spark  discharge  went  into  filamentary  mode  and  further  to
diffuse regime, delivering low energy input and thus low performance.
In the experiments referenced in Table 4, the product selectivity was
mostly independent of the electrode distance (except corona), indicating
that the reaction pathways of methane conversion are not changed by
varying  the  electrode  distance.  For  example,  in  DBD  and  micro  DBD
experiments, for three discharge gaps (0.4, 0.9 and 1.9 mm), the applied
voltage  and  current  remained  constant  while  the  methane  flow  was
varied to maintain the same residence time (4.1 s) for all configurations
[57]. However, the SEI increased and methane conversion improvement
was related to the SEI and not to the discharge gap. At constant SEI, a
decrease of the methane conversion (15.8%) was registered only when
the  gap  was  greater  than  1  mm,  which  was  the  result  of  low  plasma
density and applied electric field intensity.

An  important  parameter  in  non-thermal  plasma  is  the  reduced
electric  field  E/N  which  determines  the  mean  electron  energy  in  a
plasma and is inversely proportional to the gap distance. Above a certain
gap distance defined by the geometry of the reactor, the decrease in the
reduced electric field and the mean electron energy leads to a decrease
in methane conversion and C2 yield (Fig. 1).

2.1.4.

Influence of the pressure

The  pressure  in  the  system  is  also  an  important  parameter  to  be

considered in the distribution of products. Taking into consideration the
breakdown voltage, it is a function of the product of the discharge gap
and discharge pressure, known as the Paschen curve. The pressure rise
leads to a decrease in the electron mean free path due to higher mo-
lecular  density,  requiring  a  higher  electric  field  to  maintain  the
discharge. At constant power, the breakdown voltage increases with the
increase in pressure [53,60,64].

In their nanosecond pulsed discharge reactor, Scapinello et al. [48]
showed that acetylene or ethylene were major products depending on
the pressure. At atmospheric pressure, CH3, CH2  and CH radicals were
formed, with methyl radicals being the most abundant primary prod-
ucts,  from  electron  impact  dissociation  and  thermal  cracking  (due  to
high temperature). methyl radical recombination into ethane occurred
in  the  first  step,  followed  by  successive  dehydrogenation,  through
cracking or H abstraction. This led to a majority of acetylene following
C2H6→C2H5→C2H4→C2H3→C2H2.

Above 3 bars, ethane was also the first product formed from methyl
radical coupling. Concomitantly, a higher gas temperature was reached,
enhancing  methane  conversion  and  concentration  of  methyl  radicals.
Stepwise ethane dehydrogenation to acetylene was the main mechanism
of acetylene formation. Due to the high bulk gas temperature at 3 bars,
methyl radicals were combined not only to ethane, but also to ethylene.
Then,  as  under  atmospheric  pressure,  thermal  stepwise  ethane  dehy-
drogenation to acetylene occurred.

2.1.5.

Influence of the specific energy input

One  essential  parameter  in  plasma-assisted  methane  conversion  is
the specific energy input, which is defined as the plasma input power
(cid:0) 1 of feed
divided by the methane flow rate. It is usually expressed in kJ L
(cid:0) 1 of input methane. SEI can be altered by either varying
flow or kJ mol
the  input  power,  or  the  flow  rate,  i.e.  residence  time.  Increasing  the
power (via the applied voltage or pulse frequency) increases the energy
function of electrons and the frequency of electron-molecule collisions
which then leads to higher methane conversion. On the other hand, high
SEI favors carbon formation. The trick is to find a good balance between
those parameters to promote both methane conversion and selectivity to
desired products.

2.1.5.1. Effect  of  the  input  power. Increasing  the  applied  voltage  in-
creases the electric field strength, electron density, and energy brought
to the system. Liu et al. [65] obtained an increase in methane conversion
that was almost linear with the input power from 15 to 75 W, corre-
(cid:0) 1 of pure methane in a DBD plasma.

The maximum methane conversion reached 36% at a discharge power of
75 W, which was also predicted by an artificial neural network model. In
addition,  increasing  the  discharge  power  decreased  the  selectivity  of
acetylene  and  ethylene  by  30%  and  simultaneously  enhanced  the
selectivity of saturated hydrocarbons (ethane, propane and butane). A
perfect match between the experimental and simulated data at discharge
powers between 15 and 55 W was achieved. The authors suggested that
increasing the plasma power inhibits the generation of light hydrocar-
bons and converts them to saturated hydrocarbons and hydrogen.

(cid:0) 1  to 76 kJ L

The input energy showed a powerful but also antagonist effect on the
conversion of methane, depending on the plasma configuration. Using a
micro-plasma  reactor  (micro-DBD,  below  1  mm)  with  pure  methane
flow,  Wang  et  al.  [57]  showed  that  increasing  the  power,  thus  the
(cid:0) 1, led to an increase in
average input energy from 31 J L
methane conversion (maximum at 20.5%). They stated that the increase
in the specific energy input (SEI) is linked to the enhanced electric field
and to the increased average input energy per methane molecule. Ethane
was the main product due to the low energy per pulse (1.3 mJ) and short
period (<52 μs) of the micro discharge. Moreover, selectivity to ethane
(cid:0) 1)  was  favored  due  to  its  lower  thermodynamics  when
(67.5  kJ  mol
(cid:0) 1).  Further  increase  of  the  SEI,
compared  to  ethylene  (202.6  kJ  mol
(cid:0) 1,  had  negative  results  on  the  reaction,  leading  to  an
above  90  kJ  L
unstable  plasma  process  and  a  9%  selectivity  to  carbon.  With  that in
mind, the increase in methane conversion was observed up to the limit
where carbon formation and its deposition altered the discharge char-
acteristics. A decrease in the ethane selectivity was equally observed.
This was attributed to the more energetic plasma species and the reac-
tion of ethane to form higher hydrocarbons or degradation to carbon.

Zhu  et  al.  [24]  found  that  methane  conversion  and  C2  yield  were
promoted  when  the  input  energy  density  was  increased  in  a  positive
pulsed  corona  discharge,  and  more  favorably  than  under  a  negative
corona.  They  explained  this  difference  based  on  the  propagation  of
streamers.  Positive  pulse  streamers  can  cross  the  electrode  gap  and
activate a larger volume than negative pulse streamers which  remain
concentrated in the vicinity of the corona wire. They increased the SEI
by  increasing  the  input  power  and  decreasing  the  residence  time,  fa-
voring methane conversion and C2 yield. At an input energy density of
(cid:0) 1, the conversion of methane reached 44.6% and 31.6% C2
1.8 kJ mol
yield with an acetylene yield of 30.1%.

2.1.5.2. The  effect  of  pulse  repetition  frequency  and  pulse  duration. In
their 2017 review, Scapinello et al. [21] cited a large number of authors
who  reported  only  a  weak  effect  of  frequency  (below  10  kHz)  on
methane conversion and product selectivities, either from experimental
or modeling studies with various DBD plasma reactors, due to their low
energy density and low temperature. However, above 10 kHz, frequency
leads to a different reactivity trend as the gas temperature increases. As
cited by the authors, the memory effect and ionic remnants would also
modify  the  chemical  reactions  and  physical  characteristics  of  the
discharge and thus affect methane conversion. Jeong et al. [66] have
shown that in a pulsed DC barrier discharge at atmospheric pressure, the
selectivities of ethane and ethylene were not influenced by the change of
pulse frequency, but by the change of energy input from applied voltage
and methane flow rate. The increase in the pulse frequency led only to
an increase in methane conversion but there was no significant change
in the product selectivities.

Recently,  the  same  group  [53]  looked  at  the  influence  of  applied
frequency on the conversion of methane and product selectivity using
nanosecond  pulse  discharge  in  a  plate-to-plate  configuration.  The
methane conversion and acetylene yield were maximized in an optimal
range  of  frequencies  (3–10  kHz),  where  the  discharge  and  bulk  tem-
peratures, as well as the concentration of active species with long life-
times  were  high.  Such  effects  would  promote  thermal  cracking  of
methane instead of excitation and ionization of the gas. A further in-
crease in the frequency (above 20 kHz) led to an even higher bulk gas

temperature, reducing the plasma resistance and energy in the heating
of the system instead of channeling it into the discharge. The drop in
energy input in the discharge took over the thermal effect that led to the
decrease in methane conversion and acetylene yield.

The  methane  conversion  and  product  distribution  dependence  on
pulse repetition and pulse duration in a microwave plasma was studied
by Heintze et al. [35]. The results were plotted as a function of the en-
ergy  input,  i.e.  pulse  duration  increase.  At  low  frequency  (200  Hz),
increasing the pulse duration from 100 to 300 μs (energy input from 2.2
(cid:0) 1) enhanced methane conversion (from 19% to 68%)
to 9.8 eV molecule
and acetylene selectivity (from 48% to 72%). Ethylene and ethane se-
lectivities  remained  below  20%  and  tend  to  decrease  slightly  with
increased SEI. A much different trend was observed at high frequency (1
kHz) with very short pulses (from 20 to 60 μs), where the increase of
input energy to 9 eV led to 90% methane conversion and changed the
profile of C2 products selectivity. Increasing the energy input from 1.5 to
(cid:0) 1  increased the acetylene selectivity from 5% to 80%,
9 eV molecule
while the ethane selectivity dropped considerably (from 75% to nearly
zero from 7 eV molecule

(cid:0) 1).

The authors showed an increased concentration of atomic hydrogen
with  increasing  energy  density,  thus  increasing  the  dehydrogenation
reaction. Additionally, they recorded the gas temperature time-averaged
over the microwave pulse and observed a significant increase with the
increase of input energy from 1477 k to 2551 K. In their process, the
dissociation of methane to produce CHx and atomic hydrogen is greatly
enhanced  with  energy  input,  either  from  pulse  frequency  or  pulse
duration increase. The increase in gas temperature with the energy input
enhances the dehydrogenation of methane (whose rate is exponentially
dependent on temperature) and reduces the energy requirements for the
conversion. The selectivity to C2 products also depends on the concen-
tration  of  hydrogen  atoms  and  temperature.  From  time  resolved  OES
analysis, long pulses (100–300 μs) lead to a strong increase of hydrogen
atoms,  enhancing  the  reaction  rate  of  atomic  hydrogen  and  favoring
acetylene production, while short pulses result in low concentration of
hydrogen atoms and are selective to ethane. This conclusion is only valid
for low energy inputs. At high energy input, the dehydrogenation of CHx
and C2Hx by hydrogen atoms and by the high gas temperature shifts the
selectivity of ethane to acetylene for the short and long pulse durations.

2.1.5.3. The effect of residence time. The residence time, by changing the
gas flow rate, influences the SEI and thus the methane conversion [32,
56]. Experiments were performed at the same deposited power while
varying the total gas flow rate. Consequently, the specific energy input
varied  as  a  function  of  residence  time.  Long  residence  times  in  the
discharge  volume  increase  the  collision  probability  of  the  feed  gas
molecules with the plasma active species and increase the energy input,
enhancing highly energetic electrons. Increasing the residence time in
the plasma discharge zone can significantly enhance the conversion of
methane, as seen in Table 5.

The  increase  in  conversion  of  methane  with  prolonged  residence
time [44,56,57,67] resulted in high C2 yields. However, it was difficult
to draw a trend since, to double the value of the C2 yield, the residence
time had to be increased six times in Ref. [44] as compared to an in-
crease  of  only  three  times  in  Ref.  [32].  In  the  presence  of  helium, in
stoichiometry with methane, the C2 yield was less affected by the resi-
dence time: doubling the residence time from 12 to 24 s led to an in-
crease  in  C2  yield  by  only  5%.  The  selectivity  of  ethane,  however,
decreased  with  the  increased  residence  time,  as  was  the  case  for  the
overall  C2  selectivities,  suggesting  carbon  deposition  even  though  no
indication was given by the authors.

The residence time is an important parameter not only in DBD re-
actors  but  also  in  gliding  arc  reactors  [26].  Increasing  the  flow  rate
(cid:0) 1 in this case) led to the formation of
above a certain value (66 mL min
an intermittent discharge, caused by the carbon deposition. As the flow
rate increased, the C2 hydrocarbons selectivity fluctuated around 90%,

balance was lower due to a more important carbon deposition.

2.1.6.

Influence of the temperature

As seen previously, the system reactivity can be influenced by the
temperature  evolution  inside  the  plasma  volume,  either  from  Joule
dissipation  or  from  external  heating  (in  the  presence  of  an  oxidant
[68–70]).

An  example  illustrating  this  behavior  is  the  increase  in  ethane
selectivity  with  the  decreased  gas  temperature  of  different  plasma
sources: hollow cathode = pulsed spark < pulsed DBD < AC DBD. AC
and pulsed DBD were also the sources with the lowest electron density
[20]. The same effect was observed by Li [61], when comparing pulsed
streamer discharges, pulsed spark discharges, pulsed DC DBD and AC
DBD. Acetylene yield was almost the same in pulsed streamer discharges
as in pulsed spark discharges. The highest ethane yield (~6% at 700 kJ
(cid:0) 1 of methane) was obtained in pulsed DC DBD. In all four electric
mol
discharges,  the  ethylene  yield  was  less  than  2%  and  in  the  DBD  the
acetylene yield was less than 0.5%.

One  study  [71]  revealed,  from  a  simulation,  that  endothermic  re-
actions (i.e. homolytic scissions) occurred in the first few milliseconds of
a non-thermal pulsed plasma discharge, when the local temperature rose
rapidly (Fig. 2).

The  authors  proposed reaction  mechanisms,  starting with  an  elec-
tronic impact generating radicals and ions from methane dissociation.
Then,  radical  propagation  and  recombination  led  to  exothermic  re-
actions  and  an  increase  in  the  local  gas  temperature,  which  would

noticeably affect the energy efficiency. High energy efficiencies would
be  obtained  if  the  local  gas  temperature  allowed  the  thermal  decom-
position  of  ethane  and  methane,  valorizing  the  thermal  energy  from
exothermic  reactions  instead  of  losing  it  upon  dissipation.  They
concluded that high energy efficiencies are linked to the plasma’s high
specific  energies  and  to  the  formation  of  acetylene,  which  is  thermo-
dynamically stable at elevated local temperatures.

Tarverdi et al. [67] observed, in a DBD plasma, a synergistic effect of
the reactor temperature on methane conversion, C2  and C3+ selectiv-
◦
ities. Increasing the reactor temperature to 350
C led to higher methane
conversion (from 18 to 26% at CH4/He ratio = 1). C2  selectivity was
altered by the reactor temperature. The acetylene and ethylene selec-
tivities  increased,  while  the  ethane  selectivity  decreased  with  the
increased temperature.

2.1.7.

Influence of co-existing gases

2.1.7.1. The  addition  of  nitrogen. Using  nitrogen  appears  to  provide
stability  to  the  plasma  discharge  [72]  and  has  been  used  in  various
applications  such  as  air  stream  decontamination,  combustion  or
hydrogen  production,  to  name  a  few.  The  addition  of  nitrogen  as  a
co-feed for methane coupling is not very common and, to our knowl-
edge, only a very few studies have treated this subject (Table 6). Despite
its  elevated  dissociation  energy  (9.7  eV),  nitrogen  can  dissociate  and
react to produce hydrogen cyanide and ammonia in low concentrations.
The experimental and computational studies performed by Snoeckx
et al. [73] revealed that increasing nitrogen content led to an increase in

methane  conversion  and  hydrogen  yield.  The  authors  reported  a
decrease in electron density with rising nitrogen content, lowering the
impact probabilities with methane molecules. This effect was counter-
acted by the lower reaction rate constant of three-body reactions with
nitrogen (instead of methane) as the third body, reducing the generation
of  methane  from  recombination  reactions.  Finally,  a  non-symmetric
change of the dominant three-body reaction occurred at 90% nitrogen
content (methane as the third body is three times more efficient than
nitrogen).  With  increasing  nitrogen  content,  penning  dissociation
became  the  dominant  reaction  and  favored  methane  dissociation  and
hydrogen yield. However, the overall decrease of methane content with
rising  nitrogen  content impacted  the  overall  methane conversion  (i.e.
CH4 loss (%) = CH4 content (%) × CH4 conversion (%)) and hydrogen
yield,  which  decreased  with  increasing  nitrogen  content.  Only  small
yields of hydrogen cyanide or ammonia were predicted from calcula-
tions  (ppm  and  ppb  levels)  due  to  the  low  nitrogen  ionization  (low
electron  energy),  knowing  that  nitrogen  metastable  species  are  pre-
cursors for their formation.

However,  one  of  these  two  studies  provided  results  only  in  the
presence of nitrogen, so no comparison could be made with the reaction
under pure methane. Nevertheless, the presence of nitrogen in excess
(95%) in the feed resulted in good methane conversion, reaching 80%
depending on the plasma source [20]. As seen in previous sections, the
plasma  source  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  product  selectivities:
low-density plasmas such as DBD, which have low electron energy, will
favor the formation of ethane, while high-density plasma (with a high
electron  density  and  a  higher  bulk  gas  temperature)  will  favor  dehy-
drogenation to acetylene.

In the case of excess methane in the feed [56], the addition of 10%
nitrogen  did not result in  a significant  improvement  in methane con-
version (36.5–37.6%). The C2 yield slightly decreased from 11% to 9%
when nitrogen was present as a co-feed gas. An interesting feature was
the  increase  in  carbon  balance  from  71%  to  93%  when  nitrogen  was
added as an additive due to the presence of metastable excited species.
Based on Snoeckx et al. [73] work, the author implied that the addition
of  nitrogen  led  to  active  nitrogen  metastable  species.  The  methane
dissociation then occurred via Penning dissociation reactions due to the
collision of methane with those metastable species.

Interestingly, the addition of nitrogen to methane was also used as a
precursor for ammonia and C2 synthesis [74], but only in the presence of
a cobalt supported on γ-alumina catalyst. The authors showed improved
conversion  of  methane and  an  increased production  rate of  ammonia
under  microwave  plasma  as  compared  to  microwave  only.  However,
catalyst deactivation by black carbon limited the process.

2.1.7.2. The  addition of hydrogen. Hydrogen is generally added to the
feed either to hydrogenate acetylene or its precursor, or for carbon black
suppression [60,75]. The addition of hydrogen as a diluting gas stabi-
lizes the discharge, improving methane dissociation. This enhancement
was  explained  by  the  exceptional  thermal  conductivity  of  hydrogen
(0.18 W/mK), which provides a large volume of heat energy. In addi-
tion, the slightly lower dissociation energy of the H–H bond (4.52 eV)

compared  to  the  CH3–H bond  (4.55  eV),  led  to  the  reaction  of  the  H
radical (from the H–H bond) with the hydrogen in methane, enhancing
methane activation and conversion [76,77].

The effect of hydrogen was examined in different types of plasma and
the  results  are  presented  in  Table  7.  In  the  case  of  DBD  plasma,  the
addition of 10% hydrogen led to a small increase in methane conversion
from 33.2 to 36.5%, and a slight change of C2 product yield. The overall
results were not improved as compared to pure methane, suggesting that
there is an optimum proportion at which hydrogen will have a positive
effect. As a matter of fact, simulation analysis showed that there is an
optimal  value  of  the  CH4/H2  ratio  to  maximize  methane  conversion
[78]. With an initial ratio <25%, the collisions between electrons and
methane are insignificant, therefore, minimal consumption of methane
is expected due to the low methane density and high recombination rate
of CH3 and H radicals. The highest methane consumption was observed
at  50%  methane,  which  was  attributed  to  a  higher  energy  amount
channeled  into  the  plasma  due  to  the  maximum  collisions.  At  ratios
>50%, hydrogen was formed via collisions of electrons with ethane. As a
result,  ethylene  production  increased,  and  its  dehydrogenation  was
slowed down in the presence of hydrogen. The same effect was observed
in  a  non-equilibrium  pulsed  discharge,  where  contents  up  to  50%
hydrogen  had  no  marked  effect  on  methane  conversion  and  product
selectivity  [75].  However,  as  the  hydrogen  concentration  increased
further,  the  state  of  discharge  became  more  stable  and  methane  con-
version increased. Over 80% hydrogen, the process lost its interest due
to the severe reduction of the possible electron’s collision with methane.
In  a  nanosecond  pulsed  discharge  at  atmospheric  pressure,  the
addition of hydrogen decreased the carbon lack [60]. Carbon lack was
defined as carbon balance with carbon deposited on the reactor walls
and heavier species (C3–C6) inputs. At a pressure of 5 bar, by increasing
the amount of hydrogen, product selectivity shifted from acetylene to
ethylene.  The  ratio  CH4:H2  of  1:1  led  to  the  highest  ethylene  yield
(19.5%)  and  an  acetylene  yield  below  1%.  However,  the  increase  in
pressure  also  resulted  in  the  intensification  of  carbon  deposition  and
heavier  species  formation.  The  authors  referred  to  the  fundamentals
related to pressure modification to explain their results. As mentioned
previously, the pressure rise leads to a decrease in the electron mean free
path due to higher molecular density, hence increasing the breakdown
voltage. The direct consequence is the need for a stronger electric field to
generate and maintain the plasma discharge. Additionally, as the pres-
sure  increases,  a  thermal  effect  leads  to  thermal  equilibrium  and  a
decrease  in  energetic  collisions.  By  combining  hydrogen  content  and
pressure rise, it is then possible to shift the selectivity from acetylene to
ethylene.

Heintze  et  al.  [35]  investigated  the  effect  of  atomic  hydrogen  on
methane  conversion  and  product  distribution  in  a  pulsed  microwave
plasma. At low energy (2eV/molecule) with 17% hydrogen, ethane was
the most abundant product but with a much lower selectivity (45%) than
without hydrogen (~80%). Conversely, ethylene (15%) and acetylene
(25%)  selectivities  were  three  times  higher  than  in  the  absence  of
hydrogen. The increase of energy, hence local temperature, led to the
dehydrogenation of CHx  and C2Hx  entities and to the shift of product

2.1.7.3. The addition of noble gases. Plasma discharge initiation, prop-
agation  and reactivity  are modified  in the  presence of  noble gases. A
majority  of  published  work  accordingly  agreed  that  CH3  radicals  are
formed via homolytic hydrogen abstraction of methane, either catalyt-
ically or by electronic impact. In the presence of noble gases, the for-
mation  of  methyl  radicals  can  also  be  a  result  of  direct  methane
collisions with excited noble gas species. Even though noble gases own a
higher  ionization  energy  compared  to  methane,  their  breakdown
voltage is much lower. This phenomenon is attributed to the small size of
noble  gas  atoms,  resulting  in  longer  electron  mean  free  path,  greater
electron  acceleration  and  an  increase  in  their  temperature  [78].
Compared to argon or nitrogen, activated helium is a much better charge
and  energy  transfer  body  [67].  The  “Penning  dissociation”  phenome-
non, identified as an energy transfer from excited entities to others in the
ground state, explains the improved methane reactivity in helium [79]:

Argon  as  diluent  is  also  involved  in  some  extra  reactions  in  the
plasma zone [26]. The argon atom in its ionic or excited state act as an
energy carrier. The ionized species in the plasma can be involved in the
charge-exchange and electro-ion recombination reactions:
Ar + e(cid:0) → Ar+ + 2 e(cid:0)

(32)

The conversion of methane can be considerably affected by the na-
ture of the noble gases, as it can be seen in Table 8. Regrettably, the
studies did not provide results under pure methane for comparison.

The ratio of methane/noble gas is an important parameter and can
have adverse effects on the plasma reaction. In their study, Wang et al.
[32] showed a decrease in both methane conversion and selectivities to
acetylene  and  ethylene  while  ethane  selectivity  increased  when  the
CH4/Ar ratio increased in a micro DBD plasma. High content of methane
in the feed favors its dissociation into methyl radicals and recombination
in ethane. Under low CH4/Ar ratio, Penning dissociation phenomenon is
favored  and  methane  dissociates  to  CH3  and  further  to  CH2  and  CH
radicals, promoting recombination into acetylene and ethylene.

In their glidarc reactor [26], Hu S. et al. also reported a decrease in
methane  conversion  (from  ~45%  to  ~28%)  and  total  C2  selectivities
with the increase in CH4/Ar ratio. They observed deposited carbon on
the electrodes, whose amount increased with the reaction time. At low
carbon content, an increase in C2 selectivity was observed. The authors
suggested  that  the  reaction  mechanisms  involved  an  equilibrium  be-
tween the following species: C2H2x ↔ 2CHx
, depending on
the carbon content.

Noble gases do not undergo chemical transformation, they mostly act
like energy carriers for the reaction and they will modify the methane
activation mechanism during the plasma treatment. Generally, a noble
gas can affect methane conversion by increasing the electron tempera-
ture and the density of electrons and active species. Atomic hydrogen
plays  a  key  role  in  the  methane  plasma  chemistry,  with  hydrogen
abstraction  by  H  atoms  being  an  important  channel  for  further
dehydrogenation.

2.2. Plasma-alone for the oxidative coupling of methane

Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane:

Within the vast literature involving the partial oxidation of methane,
oxygen, carbon dioxide and water have been used as additives to pro-
mote the efficiency of the process and selectivity to end products. In this
section, publications that reported the production of C2 compounds are
reported. In the production of C2 hydrocarbons, the DBD plasma reactors
present both advantages and drawbacks. When pure methane is used as
a feed, a major issue is the coke formation and the carbon deposition on
the  surface  of  the  electrode  and/or  dielectric,  which  will  impact  the
power. In this case, the number of discharge streamers is reduced, thus
limiting the number of energetic electrons that interact with the feed gas
in the discharge zone, which consequently lowers the methane conver-
sion.  For  this  reason,  several  studies  [47,59,62]  have  attempted  to
reduce the coke formation by adding an oxidant to the discharge feed.
Despite  the  low  improvements  in  yield  of  C2  compounds,  mostly
ethylene,  hindering  a  cost-effective  upscaling,  active  research  in  this
field has resulted in reliable mechanisms understanding [8].

2.2.1. Effect of the oxidant nature: oxygen with methane

2.2.1.1. Plasma  chemistry. C–H  bond  dissociation  is  the  rate  deter-
mining step in methane activation. One advantage of plasma reactivity
comes from its electronic activation of molecules. The process, though,
requires a large amount of energy to trigger inelastic electron collisions,
which is partially lost via molecular collisions, which is responsible for
the  low  energy  efficiency  of  the  methane  dissociation  [33].  The  high
(cid:0) 1  at 298 K) makes electronic methane
activation energy (440 kJ mol
dissociation a slow reaction. This can be counteracted by adding oxygen
which, even if present in traces, can induce exothermic reactions. The
presence of oxygen in a plasma results in the formation of ionic species
(O
), excited neutrals (O*, O2*, O3*) and ozone [80].

Kogelschatz et al. [42,80] showed that in oxygen plasma in micro
DBD, about 80% of the electron energy went into the dissociation pro-
cess in E/N range of 100–200 Td. In their publication, Liu et al. [22]
specified that in corona discharge at low input voltages, i.e. low reduced
electric field, O
formation reaction is the determining step. Increasing
the voltage will enhance the reduced electric field and mean electron
and disso-
energy, increasing in consequence the concentration of O
ciated radicals, promoting succeeding reactions. The authors suggested
a “saturation” ionization rate in their corona system that may limit the
rate of conversion. They reported the following reactions:

Based on optical emission spectroscopy results and kinetic data of
combustion modeling, it was proposed that the reaction O(1D) + CH4
→OH
plays  a  key  role  in  plasma  methane  conversion  [82].
Moreover, the authors showed that the activation degree of oxygen was
increased  by  using  a  single  dielectric  plasma  reactor  and  an  arc
discharge plasma reactor. Zhang et al. [68] studied in an AC DBD reactor
the effect of an external temperature on the partial oxidation of methane
in excess of nitrogen. Not only did they confirmed the electron-induced
chemistry, but they also include thermal activation (up to a limit) for
methane and oxygen conversion. From their results, they suggested that
methane partial oxidation is mainly governed by the electron density at
a given temperature and E/N, the reaction rate of the electron impact
dissociation being proportional to the electron density. Once external
heat  was  brought  to  the  system,  methane  and  oxygen  conversion
increased up to a temperature limit (773 K) then dropped. At this tem-
perature,  the  plasma  shifted  from  a  filamentary  discharge  mode  to  a
resistive  power  loss  mode  (from  Lissajous  observation).  Selectivity  to
product  was  only  linked  to  thermo-chemistry  since  it  remained  un-
changed with the increase in energy input or E/N intensity. The increase
in the background temperature from 273 K to 773 K improved carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide selectivities, while hydrogen and C2  se-
lectivities  dropped,  due  to  the  change  in  plasma  resistance  at  high
temperatures.

2.2.1.2. Influence of the oxygen-methane ratio. The addition of oxygen at
different concentrations in the gas mixture affects the conversion and
selectivities to C2, oxygenated compounds and syngas. The low energy
threshold  for  oxygen  dissociation  produces  reactive  atomic  oxygen
species which improve methane conversion and reduce carbon deposi-
tion. The heat released from exothermic oxidation reactions also pro-
motes  thermo-chemical  reactions.  However,  these  reactions  are  only
beneficial  at  low ratios  where  they  supplement  the  electron/methane
dissociation  reactions.  At  high  levels  of  oxygen,  the  reduction  of  the

average electron temperature and reaction of oxygen with carbon favor
syngas and carbon dioxide selectivities at the expense of C2.

The effect of the methane-oxygen ratio was reported in a study using
negative DC glow discharge for ethylene production [83]. At relatively
low  oxygen  content  (20–25%),  the  conversion  of  methane  reached  a
maximum  at  ~20%  with  46%  selectivity  in  acetylene  and  ethylene
(Table  9).  A  complete  suppression  of  carbon  filaments  that  were
observed in the absence of oxygen was achieved. At high oxygen content
(above  30%),  the  methane  conversion  dropped  due  to  the  increased
collisions between energetic electrons with oxygen rather than methane.
The  C2  selectivity  also  dropped  and a  shift of  acetylene  and  ethylene
selectivity to ethane was observed. The authors suggested that, under
high oxygen content, the energy of the free electrons would be lower
than  under  low  oxygen  content,  at  the  same  energy  input.  Methane
dissociation  into  methyl  radicals  would  be  favored  with  subsequent
dimerization in ethane. While, at low oxygen content, the higher elec-
tron collision with methane would favor its conversion into CH2 radicals
and increase ethylene production.

Methane-oxygen activation using DBD plasma was investigated [47]
in the presence of noble gases. The oxidative methane conversion ex-
periments  were  performed  with  either  1%  or  5%  oxygen  in  10%
methane diluted in argon, at a constant applied voltage of 5 kV.

The addition of oxygen (1%) slightly enhanced methane conversion,
which decreased to 5%. A small amount of oxygen improved methane
conversion via electron impact dissociation reactions and reactions with
reactive atomic oxygen. Thermo-chemical reactions also took place due
to the heat released by the exothermic oxidation reactions. However, at
higher oxygen content, methane conversion was limited by the reduc-
tion of the average electron temperature. The introduction of oxygen did
reduce carbon formation (improved carbon balance) but, at high con-
tent, the selectivity to C2 species, especially ethane was shifted to syngas
formation  (Table  9).  The  drop  in  hydrogen  selectivity  was  due  to  its
reaction with oxygen to form water.

Aghamir et al. [84] studied the effect of the methane-oxygen ratio
diluted in helium on the methanol and C2 selectivities in a DBD reactor.
The methane flow rate was kept constant, while oxygen flow rate was
(cid:0) 1. The
adjusted with helium to maintain a total flow rate of 100 mL min
conversion  of  methane  improved  slightly  from  7%  to  12%  when  the
O2/CH4  ratio  increased  from  0.1  to  1.  The  highest  methanol  and
ethylene selectivities were obtained at low oxygen content (O2/CH4  =
0.05),  while  (surprising  result)  neither  ethane  nor  acetylene  were
detected  (Fig.  3).  The  authors  based  their  argumentation  on  the  pro-
(cid:0)
duction of O2
active species from electron impact reactions. On
one, side the active oxygen species improved methane dissociation into
methyl radicals and the production of ethylene, while on the other side,
OH
reaction  with  hydrogen  would  promote  methanol
production.

2.2.2. Effect of the oxidant nature: carbon dioxide and methane

2.2.2.1. Plasma  chemistry. The  use  of  carbon  dioxide  as  a  milder
oxidant  can,  in  some  cases,  be  preferable  to  favor  the  desired  end
products, as summarized in different reviews [36,85,86]. Puliyalil et al.
[36]  discussed  the  fundamentals  behind  methane  and  carbon  dioxide
activation in non-thermal plasmas, as well as the ensuing mechanistic
routes of excited species recombination to valuable products. Methane
dissociation into methyl radicals requires electron energies of 4.45 eV
[87]. To lose more than one hydrogen, higher electron energy is needed
to produce CH2 and CH radicals (~10 eV), while the oxidants have lower
dissociation energies (5.5 eV for carbon dioxide and 5.1 eV for oxygen).
Non-equilibrium plasmas can provide electrons with energies up to 10
eV [36], but they are scarce and it is most likely that methane further
dissociation  will  occur  via  thermal  dehydrogenation  or  reaction  with
excited species of carbon dioxide. Methane conversion increases under
the influence of the reactive oxygen species arising from carbon dioxide.
A  mechanism  proposed  by  Istadi  et  al.  [85]  relates  the  removal  of  H
atom from methane to generate methyl radicals that subsequently react
with excited species from carbon dioxide in the plasma zone. Co-feeding
methane and carbon dioxide favor their respective conversion.

Ozkan et al. [88] described the reaction pathways for the formation
and  consumption  of  intermediates  and  value-added  products  from
methane  and  carbon  dioxide.  Hydrogen  is  produced  from  numerous
reactions,  via  radical  or  electron-induced  dissociation  of  hydrocarbon
species.

Ethane is generated from different pathways. The most probable is
the recombination of two CH3 radicals (reaction 83). Ethane can also be
formed via C2H5 radicals (reactions 84 and 85). However, another study
with  an  atmospheric  DBD  source has  shown  that the  density of  C2H5
radicals is lower than the density of CH3 radicals, thus the formation of
ethane is less probable [73].

The  addition  of  noble  gases  (e.g.  argon  and  helium)  in  methane-
carbon dioxide plasmas provides a dilution degree and the new active
species formed may speed up the reactions, as observed in non-oxidative
processes.  They  will  act  as  third  body  molecules,  providing  charge
transfer  to  carbon  dioxide  and  methane,  improving  their  conversion.
Moreover, the rather low breakdown potential of argon and helium in-
creases the density of micro-discharges and electrons in the plasma and
may improve oxygenates yield [86].

Janeco et al. [92] evaluated the role of helium in a kinetic model
study  of  a  DBD  plasma.  They  showed  that  the  addition  of  helium  to
CH4/CO2 mixture led to significant changes in the electron kinetics. The
elastic collisions in helium induced a shift of the electron velocity dis-
tribution function and led to an increase in the electronic excitation and
ionization  frequencies  in  methane  and  carbon dioxide.  Moreover,  the
ionization  reactions  involved  collisions  between  methane,  carbon  di-
oxide and their products, but not helium.

Changes in electron kinetics were also illustrated by Goujard et al.
[79] in a coaxial DBD reactor, who showed that the addition of helium to
a methane and carbon dioxide feed modified the physical parameters
(discharge energy) and the chemical reactivity (reactants and products
selectivity) of the plasma discharge. At a fixed contact time, the con-
versions of methane and carbon dioxide increased with the amount of
helium in the gas mixture. The dilution with helium greatly enhanced
the selectivity to syngas, while the selectivities for higher hydrocarbons
decreased significantly.

The overall spatially and time-averaged mean electron energy was
calculated in a one-dimensional fluid model on a cylindrical DBD reactor
for pure methane (2 eV), oxygen (1.6 eV) and carbon dioxide (2.1 eV)
[93]. The calculations of the mean electron energy and ion (positive and
negative) densities showed that methane with oxygen plasma possesses
the highest density  of negative ions and  is more electronegative than
with carbon dioxide. It resulted in a change in selectivity to products.
Hydrogen  peroxide,  methanol,  ethanol,  methyl  hydroperoxide
(CH3OOH), and ethyl hydroperoxide (C2H5OOH) were the highest with
oxygen.  When  the  gas  was  switched  to  carbon  monoxide,  hydrogen,
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, ketene or ethenone (CH2CO) and higher
hydrocarbons (CxHy) were favored.

Within the published data, only a few models have been proposed
due to the complexity of linking discharge characteristics (in terms of
small volume and extremely short time frame) to the chemical kinetics
occurring in the whole reactor in a wider time range [92].

2.2.2.2. Influence of the specific input energy. As already reported, a high
SEI results in an increased probability of the collision of reactant mol-
ecules with  highly energetic electrons and  active  species,  resulting in
increased conversion. In their review, Istadi et al. [85] reported the ef-
fect  of  input  energy  in  various  DBD  reactors,  including  power  and
residence time modifications. At low discharge power, carbon dioxide
conversion  is  higher  than  methane  due  to  its  lower  dissociation
threshold  energy.  By  increasing  the  discharge  power,  electrons  with
higher  energy  are  produced,  improving  the  methane  conversion  and
altering the  selectivity to  hydrocarbons. The authors reported several
publications  where  high  power  led  to  a  temperature  increase  in  the
discharge  channel,  shifting the  selectivity  of C2–C3  hydrocarbons  and
oxygenates to C4–C5  hydrocarbons, via thermal reactions. High power
resulted  also  in  a  lower  energy  efficiency  of  the  process  and  in  coke
formation,  which  is  a  critical  problem.  Moreover,  some  publications

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience101(2024)10109613

V. Maslova et al.

were ambiguous when looking at products distribution, in particular the
H2/CO ratio and hydrocarbons selectivity. As example, Liu et al. [94]
reported an increase of the H2/CO ratio, with constant carbon monoxide
selectivity, implying a decrease of the H/C ratio of hydrocarbons with
increased power, while Song et al. [95] reported constant hydrocarbons
selectivity and H2/CO ratio. In their review, Istadi et al. [85] reported
that the change in residence time does not affect the H2/CO ratio, that
would depend mainly on the CH4/CO2 ratio.

Similarly to their study on partial oxidation, Zhang et al. [69] studied
the dry reforming reaction on the same AC DBD reactor with the addi-
tion of external heat. They reported the same effects, i.e. the electron
induced chemistry for methane and carbon dioxide dissociation, while
selectivity to products was dictated by thermo-chemistry. Methane and
carbon  dioxide  conversion  increased  with  the  SEI  (increased  input
power), while selectivities to carbon monoxide, hydrogen, ethane and
propane were not altered. When the temperature was increased to 773
K, the selectivity to syngas dropped as the selectivity to hydrocarbons
rose.  CH2  and  CH  species  are  assumed  to  be  produced  by  thermal
dehydrogenation.  The  same  effects  on  methane  and  carbon  dioxide
conversion  and  hydrocarbons  selectivity  were  observed  on  a  nano-
second pulsed DBD plasma by Mei et al. [96], except that the H2/CO
ratio decreased with power.

The  influence  of  the  specific  energy  input  was  also  studied  in  a
gliding  arc  reactor  by  varying  the  input  power  (Table  10)  [27].  The
increase in the SEI led to an increase in both methane and carbon di-
oxide  conversions,  while  the  acetylene  and  ethylene  selectivities
decreased.  The  selectivity  to  acetylene  was  always  higher  than  the
selectivity to ethylene, which was explained by the lower bond disso-
ciation energy of CH2CH–H (4.76 eV) [97] compared to CHC–H (5.71
eV) [98], thus leading to further dehydrogenation. No ethane was re-
ported,  due  to  the  higher  temperature  of  GAD  compared  to  DBD  or
pulsed glow reactor, which led to a rapid dehydrogenation of ethane.

The coke deposition on the electrodes was high at elevated power
and in excess of methane. The coke deposition inhibited the insulating
properties of the Teflon plates covering the gliding arc electrodes. This
not only led to plasma instability but also to a discharge between the
Teflon and the electrodes, ensuing safety issues (arc).

Uytdenhouwen et al. [99] carried out a systematic study on the effect
of  the  DBD  reactor  geometry  on  the  methane  coupling  reaction  by
varying the shape and size of the reaction zone and the gas flow direc-
tion in a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane. They reported that a
short and wide configuration with seven inlets - seven outlets placed in
front  of  each  other  performed  better  than  a  traditional  configuration
with  a  long  and  narrow  geometry.  They  also  stated  that  in  a  one
inlet-one  outlet  reactor  with  a  flow  from  the  bottom  to  the  top,  the
traditional long configuration resulted in methane conversion of 13.7%.
With  the  same  residence  time  but  in  a  shorter  and  wider  reactor
configuration methane conversion increased slightly to 14.9%. This was
explained by the reduced gas velocity in short but wide reactor, allowing
a  better diffusion and mixing of reactants and products. As  expected,

methane conversion was found to be dependent on the input power and
the residence time. In the pursuit of investigating the effect of SEI, it was
found that increasing the residence time favored methane and carbon
dioxide conversion since SEI increased.

2.2.2.3. Influence  of  methane/carbon  dioxide  ratio. The  hydrocarbons
selectivity was found to be strongly dependent on the molar ratio, as it
was observed with oxygen (Table 11). In a study by Pham et al. [100],
the production of syngas was favored, the carbon monoxide selectivity
being equal to ~70%, when a stoichiometric mixture of methane and
carbon dioxide was used in a DBD reactor (Fig. 4).

The hydrocarbons selectivity (from C2  to C4) became important in
excess  methane.  Within  C2  products,  ethane  selectivity  reached  23%
with a ratio equal to 6.5, whereas ethylene and acetylene selectivities
were lower than 3%. The production of hydrocarbons was concomitant
with carbon deposition, mainly with a high molar ratio (carbon balance
= 75%). The methane conversion was not strongly modified by the gas
ratio, which was close to 20%.

In a coaxial DBD reactor [101], methane conversion was dependent
on  the  molar  ratio,  which  increased  in  excess  of  carbon  dioxide.
Following the same trend, the hydrogen selectivity increased to nearly
100%  and  the  carbon  monoxide  selectivity  to  72%.  However,  the
selectivity of ethane decreased by a factor of 2 while its yield was quite
independent of the ratio. It appeared that methane conversion, selec-
tivities  and  yields  of  carbon  monoxide  and  hydrogen  are  favored  in
excess of carbon monoxide, preventing the recombination of CHx species
to produce higher hydrocarbons. A similar trend was reported by D. Mei
et  al.  [96]  who  observed  the  improvement  of  methane  conversion,
carbon monoxide and hydrogen selectivity in excess of carbon dioxide.
The selectivity of ethane was notably enhanced at high ratios.

Activation by pulse corona plasma [102] followed the same trend as
DBD plasma. The conversion of methane increased in excess of carbon
dioxide. The yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased with increasing carbon
dioxide content in feed reaching, at 40% carbon dioxide, a maximum
yield of 12.7%. The acetylene concentration was relatively high within
the  C2  compounds  but  decreased  with  an  increase  in  carbon  dioxide
content. Ethane and ethylene were also detected and their concentra-
tions increased with the carbon dioxide content.

Recently, the effect of the ratio was studied using parallel electrodes
in  a  gliding  plasma  configuration  [25].  Following  the  same  trend  as
discussed above, the conversion of methane increased from 48% to 55%
with the increase of the carbon dioxide content from ~26% to ~72%,
while  the  selectivity  of  acetylene  decreased  from  40%  to  8%.  Other
hydrocarbons were detected with a lower selectivity: ethylene (1.5–2%),
butane  (0.2–1.7%),  benzene  (0.2–3.1%)  and  the  selectivity  of  ethane
was not reported.

In their study on the effect of the DBD reactor geometry, Uytden-
houwen  et  al.  [99]  also  looked  at  the  influence  of  the  CO2:CH4  ratio
(from 6:1 to 1:6) and reported a constant decrease in methane conver-
sion as the carbon dioxide content increased. Carbon dioxide conversion
went through a maximum at a 3:1 (CO2: CH4) ratio with 15%. Increasing
the methane content up to 100% methane improved the hydrocarbon
content,  which  reached  72%  of  C2,  17%  of  C3,  2%  isobutane,  5%
n-butane  and  2%  2-methylbutane.  However,  in  terms  of  energy  effi-
ciency and conversions, they reported an optimum energy cost of 1.5
kWh/mol of reactant mixture at a 3:1 and 6:1 (CO2: CH4) ratios.

2.2.3. Effect of the oxidant nature: water and methane

It  is  established  in  the  literature  that  the  presence  of  water  vapor
consumes electrons to form OH radicals but also species such as H2O
,
reducing the electrons availability for methane activation. Nevertheless,
the use of water vapor inhibits carbon deposition efficiently while sta-
bilizing the discharge.

reforming reaction occurred in addition to coupling reaction.

The  conversion  of  methane  in  the  presence  of  steam  was  equally
investigated  by  Zhang  et  al.  [59]  in  a  DBD  reactor,  by  changing  the
power,  the  gap,  the  electrode  material,  the  flow  rate  and  steam  pro-
portion. A part of the results are presented in Table 12.

The  conversion  of  methane  was  improved  in  presence  of  steam,
although the differences were not that significant. The distribution of
products, especially ethylene selectivity, was strongly influenced by the
presence  of the  oxidant in  the feed.  Liu et  al.  [70] studied the  steam
reforming of methane in a DBD reactor with a controlled external tem-
perature, following the same way as their studies on partial oxidation
and dry reforming reaction. They reported the effect of electron induced
chemistry and thermo-chemistry (i.e. background gas temperature) on
the  conversions and  product  selectivities. Water conversion  would  be
dependent on the electron-impact reactions, while methane would be
converted by both electron-impact and thermal reactions. Selectivity to
ethane was found to be dependent on thermo-chemistry.

2.3. Comparison of plasma-alone non-oxidative and oxidative methane
coupling

Different  input  parameters  have  been  studied  in  order  to  achieve
high CH4  conversion and olefin yield. As already mentioned, the main
products  of  methane  conversion  are  acetylene,  ethane,  ethylene,
hydrogen and carbon. Data presented in the literature concerning the
carbon balance or product yield (mainly hydrogen) is incomplete, since,

most of the time, the information is missing. The large number of plasma
sources that have been studied for direct methane conversion to added
value products makes it difficult to draw an objective comparison be-
tween  them  when  plotting  C2  selectivity  versus  methane  conversion
(Fig. 6). Nevertheless, pulsed discharges reach the highest C2  selectiv-
ities with methane conversion around 40%.

It  was  shown  from  published  work  that  methane  conversion  is
mainly  improved  by  the  high electron energy  (which  depends  on the
reduced  electric  field  strength)  and  to  thermal  effect.  Each  type  of
plasma  provides  a  range  of  electron  density  and  reduced  electric
strength on which reactivity will depend (Table 13). Due to their simple
design and ease of implementation, most of the research to date has been
performed with DBDs. To improve the conversion and the product dis-
tribution, several approaches have been investigated, including chang-
ing  the  residence  time,  the  applied  voltage,  the  pulse  frequency  and
duration, the gap, the pressure, using different electrode materials and/
or mixing with other gases. All those parameters in fine altered the SEI.
While  not  present  in  every  publication  reported,  the  specific  energy
input (SEI) represents a suitable parameter to compare the data.

Specific  Energy  Input  (SEI),  is  defined  as  the  deposed  energy  per

mole (or liter) of methane and can be estimated as:

Increasing the SEI not only increases the dissociation reaction rate
but also the heat dissipation, which will depend greatly on the plasma
source  (Fig.  7).  However,  the  product  selectivities  are  generally
dependent on the SEI. The best conversions were obtained with spark
discharges,  but  pulsed  discharges  were  reported  to  have  the  best  C2
selectivities  at  relatively  high  conversions  (40–50%)  as  compared  to
DBD. It appears that most of the DBD plasma results in methane con-
version  below  40%,  with  C2  selectivity  oscillating  between  20%  and
60% for the majority. In fact, DBD favors ethane formation and a little
C3, C4  compounds, owing to its low electron density and temperature.
When  the  electron  density  and  energy  increases,  by  increasing  the
reduced electric field, methane fragmentation shifts from CH3 radicals to
CH2,  CH  radicals  and  C  and  favor C2  products  formation.  The pulsed

nanodischarge  approach  seems  promising  as  it  results  in  high  energy
efficiency due to the presence of high energy electrons over a very short
pulse duration (usually <500 ns).

Considering  the  plasma  oxidative  coupling  of  methane,  different
optimum values for methane conversion and C2 selectivities have been
published.  Some  publication  reported  acetylene,  ethylene  and  ethane
selectivities separately, but in some cases, only the total C2  selectivity
was  given.  Fig.  8  is  an  attempt  to  compare  the  different  sources  of
plasmas used  in the  OCM  reaction  on total  C2  selectivities. The main
trend  that  can  be  highlighted  from  Fig.  8  is  the  tendency  of  C2  to
decrease with the methane conversion for the DBD and corona reactors.
It was reported that high methane conversion is linked to high SEI which
leads  to  temperature  increase  in  the  discharge  channel,  shifting  the
selectivity  of  C2  hydrocarbons  to  C4–C5  hydrocarbons,  via  thermal
reactions.

In the case of DBD plasmas, the C2  selectivity is below 50%, inde-
pendently of the type of oxidant or the ratio between the methane and
the oxidant. In terms of conversion, however, all of the data shows the
same trend, namely conversions superior to 50% when methane is in
excess in  the  feed, thanks to  the  higher  collision probability between
methane and the plasma active species. The C2 selectivity in MW and DC
glow  plasmas  is  high,  with  high  methane  conversion  for  MW.  MW
plasma generates a thermodynamic equilibrium at very high tempera-
tures in a very dense plasma in which C2 species are thermodynamically
favored and the most stable.

A comparison between the plasma reaction of methane alone and in
presence of an oxidant was performed and the results are presented in
Fig. 9.

The tendency for C2  selectivity is similar to the results obtained in
absence  of  oxidant,  i.e.  the  higher  the  C2  selectivity,  the  lower  the
methane conversion. In OCM reaction, C2  selectivity is above 50% for
some data, but only for microwave and pulse discharges. C2 selectivity is
also higher for experiments under methane/oxygen when compared to
methane/carbon dioxide and is due to differences in the chemical re-
action  pathways.  The  oxygen  acts  as  an  oxidizer  and  reacts  with
methane to form methyl and hydroxyl radicals, reaction (45). Methyl
radicals will then subsequently form ethane from recombination (reac-
tion 46) and ethylene from oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (reac-
tion 49 and 50). On the other hand, when a plasma is generated in a gas
mixture containing methane and carbon dioxide, the main reaction that
occurs is the dry reforming of methane to form carbon monoxide and

hydrogen as the main compounds and hydrocarbons to a lesser extent.
Pinh ̃ao et al. [104] linked the plasma reactor to plug flow type re-
actors where parameters such as particle number, gas volume, concen-
tration of species or volumetric flow rate are altered during the plasma
activation.  The  author  proposed  two  methods  to  avoid  producing
approximate results, by integrating either a precise semi-automatic flow
measurement with a bubble flow meter or an internal standard (IS) in
the process gas. The internal standard method was tested in the case of
methane conversion with methane –carbon dioxide mixtures with and
without helium but the addition of internal standard interfered with the
plasma discharge. The author overcame this problem by inserting the IS
at the exhaust of the reactor, upstream from the point of measurement.
They found errors up to 20% on process parameters with volumetric flux
changes. They concluded on how process calculations should integrate
the  changes  (i.e.  gas  temperature,  volumetric  flow  rate,  presence  of
condensates) coming from reactions within the reactor.

3. Plasma-catalysis for methane coupling

Many  studies  looked  at  the  interaction  between  a  plasma  and  the
packing  materials  inside  the  discharge  region  [31,105–108]  and  the
results  indicated  that  the  discharge  characteristics  are  strongly  con-
nected  to  packing  materials  that  can  affect  the  electric  field,  the  gas
breakdown  behavior  and  the  electron  parameters.  A  major  change
concerns the development of the discharge itself. Kim et al. [109] pub-
lished  a  detailed  scheme  of  the  changes  induced  by  the  presence  of
catalyst particles in the discharge volume (Fig. 10).

When  the high voltage is  applied between the  electrodes, a  micro
electric  field  develops  between  the  catalyst  particles,  which  become
micro-anodes and micro-cathodes. Then, micro-discharges are initiated
and the electrons between the charged particles collide with methane
molecules. In this micro electric field, secondary electrons (generated
from the interaction of methane ions with the surface atoms) sustain the
plasma discharge.

In  a  DBD  reactor,  Tu  et  al.  [110]  reported,  without  catalyst,

micro-discharges of radii 100–200 μm and 10 ns duration, dispersed in
the whole plasma area. The addition of a packed material, filling up the
plasma zone, led to a reduction of the plasma volume, interfering with
the propagation of micro-discharges. The plasma filaments developed at
(and spread over) the surface of the catalyst pellets or beads, resulting in
a  combination  of
surface  discharge  and  weak  filamentary
micro-discharge.  The  same  authors  [111]  highlighted  that  the  syner-
gistic  effect  of  plasma-catalysis  coupling  results  from  an  equilibrium
between the modification of the discharge propagation mode and the
emerging  plasma  activity  at  the  catalyst  surface.  The  development  of
filamentary  versus  surface  discharges  would  depend  on  many  factors
such  as  particle  size,  shape  and  chemical  and  physical  properties,
influencing both the propagation and intensity of the discharge.

In practice, it exists a wide range of catalytic materials dedicated to
plasma-catalytic coupling and presenting a multitude of pore sizes and
dielectric constants. The accessibility of the pore volume is important
since  the  plasma  active  species  might  interfere  within  and  modify
chemical, physical or structural characteristics. Several computational
studies by Bogaerts group, performed in two-dimensional fluid model
for  atmospheric  pressure  discharges,  have  investigated  these  effects
[112–114].  They  indicated  that  the  formation  of  microdischarges  is
possible when the pores diameter is larger than the Debye length value,
between 100 nm and 1 μm. This value depends on the electron density
and temperature of the plasma streamer. They showed that plasma can
diffuse in pores close to 50 nm, corresponding to the upper limit size of
mesopores, but to a certain extent and in a very limited time period.

3.1. Influence of particle size

Packing  catalytic  materials  in  the  plasma  reactor  modifies  the
discharge  electrical  properties,  such  as  the  electric  field  strength  and
electron  energy  distribution,  leading  to  a  modification  of  the  overall
performance.  Butterworth  et  al.  [115]  observed  both  positive  and
negative effects on the plasma properties by lowering the size of parti-
cles  in  a  study  on  a  packed-bed  DBD  for  carbon  dioxide  conversion.
Small particles may limit the formation of the discharge in the reactor
volume. Moreover, the decrease in particles size reduces the residence
time and increases pressure drop in the reactor at a constant flow rate.
Nevertheless,  small  particle  sizes  favor  the  density  of  contact  points
initiating discharges, due to an enhanced electric field. It also increases
the interfacial area between the solid and the plasma and enhances the
volume fraction of the bed occupied by the plasma. The author high-
lighted that small particles packed-bed favored surface discharges over
filamentary micro-discharges. This conclusion was based on Gallon et al.
work [111] on methane reforming, which showed that the addition of
packed catalyst in a DBD reactor led to a combination of surface dis-
charges  on  the  catalyst  and  spatially  limited  micro-discharges  in  the
volume.  The  absence  of  catalyst
to  strong  filamentary
micro-discharges. Their conclusions were based on the observation of
current signals.

On a MgO/Al2O3 catalyst (specific surface area 184 m2 g

(cid:0) 1) in a DBD
reactor operating under a CH4/Ar flow [116], an increase in CH4  con-
version and C2 yield was observed with a decrease in the size of particles.
It  confirmed  the  dependence  of  the  surface  interactions  between  the
plasma active species and the catalyst on the particle sizes. On the other
hand, enhancing the contact between the plasma and the catalyst sur-
face favored the formation of solid carbon. The smallest the particle size,
the lowest the ethane selectivity and carbon balance.

In a recent publication, Bouchoul et al. [117] studied the effect of
particle sizes on the C2 selectivity for the dry reforming of methane re-
action  using  a  cylindrical  DBD  plasma  at  atmospheric  pressure.  The
important role of particle size (between 900 and 300 μm) on conversions
and  selectivities  was  also  demonstrated.  In  particular,  the  finer  the
particle size, the better the conversions (of both methane and carbon
dioxide)  and  the  lower  the  selectivity  to  ethane.  They  based  their
conclusion on the development of the plasma in a reactor filled with a

catalyst. The plasma discharge would be in two states: 1) plasma in gas
phase  between  the  catalyst  grains,  considered  as  volume  plasma;  2)
plasma on the surface of the catalyst (i.e. surface plasma). The recorded
effect may come from the increase in the total external surface of the
smaller  catalyst  grains,  thus  favoring  the  development  of  the  surface
plasma  and  thus  catalytic  activity.  Regarding  the  secondary  reaction
products,  the  larger  the  grain  size,  the  higher  the  ethane  selectivity,
suggesting that the recombination of methyl radicals to form ethane is
favored in the gas phase and not at the surface of the catalytic support.
The  effect  of  packed  particles  was  investigated  over  α-Al2O3,  sea
sand, and KIT-6 and for each material, 3 groups with different sizes were
prepared (0 < S < 53 μm < M < 100 μm < L < 150 μm) [109]. The data
are  reported  in  Table  14.  Independently  of  the  nature  of  the  packing
material, the maximum methane conversion was achieved in the case of
M size particles, as an effect of microelectrodes induced by an external
electric field between packed dielectric particles. Acetylene selectivity
decreased as the particle size increased. Ethylene selectivity was at its
minimum for the M size particles (although the difference was not al-
ways significant). The C2 selectivity was the highest for S particles, most
probably due to their high specific surface area. The authors suggested
that in the case of small particles (S), CH2 and CH species had a higher
probability  of  being  coupled  into  unsaturated  C2  hydrocarbons.  In
contrast, if the size of the particles was large (L) and the space between
the particles was also large, the dehydrogenation seemed to occur more
frequently  than  the  coupling,  which  resulted  in  additional  carbon
deposition [109]. The increased amount of carbon deposition ensuing
from  the  dehydrogenation  reaction  seemed  to  be  the  result  of  the
increased capacitance of dielectric M particles, leading to a large num-
ber of micro-discharges.

This effect was not visible in other studies, like in the case of MgO/
Al2O3  particles, since metal-oxide doping affected the micro-discharge
efficiency  of  the  system.  The  addition  of  MgO  caused  a  difference  in
the  temperature  on  the  surface  of  the  catalyst,  resulting  in  different
catalytic  activity.  In  addition,  the  electric  conductivity  and  surface
charge  of  the  catalyst  modified  the  nature  of  radicals  and,  in  conse-
quence, the product selectivities [116].

3.2. Influence of the material shape

Jo et al. [108] investigated the effects of the surface area and the
shape of a packing material to understand how the discharge charac-
teristics are altered in the methane activation reaction. Three different
types of Al2O3 were prepared, as shown in Table 15.

The discharge was affected by the surface properties of the packed
material. A change in the electric field was observed depending on the
material placed in the discharge. Both γ-Al2O3 samples showed similar
current peaks at a fixed voltage, while α-Al2O3  beads showed low cur-
rent peaks. The change in current density modified the electron density

and the power. CH4  conversion was lower in presence α-Al2O3  beads.
Interestingly, the author reported that methane conversions for γ-Al2O3
beads  and crushed beads were identical independently of the applied
voltage despite the lower power density when the beads were used. The
catalyst shape affected the breakdown voltage (from Lissajous Q-V plots
observation), thus changing the local electric field and power (Fig. 11).
The study proved that, in a DBD reactor, the discharge parameters
were  strongly  affected  by  the  catalyst  shape  and  surface  properties.
γ-Al2O3  packing proved to be the most efficient in terms of CH4  con-
version thanks to its lower capacitance compared to α-Al2O3, providing
both  local  filamentary  discharges  in  the  pores  of  γ-Al2O3  and  surface
discharges. However, the authors did not take into account the differ-
ences in surface composition and particularly presence of –OH groups
for γ-Al2O3 [118].

3.3. Influence of the dielectric constant

The dielectric constant of the packed material will affect the surface

charging, thus the intensity and propagation of the discharge.

Zhang et al. [119] reported the importance of surface charging on the
plasma propagation inside the catalyst pores with a 2D computational
model.  They  studied  the  discharge  streamer  in  a  cylindrical  DBD
discharge. They chose characteristic dielectric constants, ranging from 4
to 200, of five metal oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and CaTiO3) with

different pore diameters.

First, they looked at the streamer propagation in the discharge vol-
ume.  The  plasma  spreading  over  the  dielectric  was  reduced  as  the
dielectric constant increased, meaning that the plasma covers a wider
area of the dielectric layer at small εr (Fig. 12). The direct consequence is
a modification of the discharge behavior from a surface discharge to a
localized filamentary mode as the dielectric constant increases. Then,
they achieved a simulation of the pores and reported the plasma density
distribution near and inside the pores, for different pore diameters and
dielectric constants. Increasing the dielectric constant led to an increase
of the plasma density (maximum at εr  = 50) but to a decrease of the
streamer propagation within the pore, due to surface charging. Surface
charging  occurs  when  the  streamer  reaches  the  pore  sidewalls  and  it
depends on the dielectric constant. At εr < 50, surface charging induces
surface  discharge  along  the  pore  sidewalls  and  favors  the  streamer
propagation  in  the  pores.  For  εr  > 50,  dielectric  polarization  is  more
pronounced,  weakening  the  surface  charging  and  slowing  down  the
streamer propagation. The discharge is more localized and more elec-
trons  will  accumulate  near  the  sharp  edge  of  the  pore  entrance.  A
moderate  εr  of  50  showed  the  highest  plasma  density  with  enhanced
electric  field  near  the  pore  entrance,  favoring  the  propagation  in  the
pore.

Taheraslani et al. [31] studied methane coupling to C2  in a packed
bed  DBD  reactor  with  materials  presenting  different  porosities  and
dielectric constants. High dielectric BaTiO3 (dielectric constant >1000)
resulted  in  a  lower  conversion  of  methane  (Fig.  13)  compared  to  the
reactor  packed  with  low  dielectric  materials  δ-alumina,  α-alumina
(dielectric  constant  = 9–10)  and  silica-SBA-15  (dielectric  constant  =
2–5). Silica-SBA-15 catalyst showed a reduced activity compared to α-
and γ-alumina. The authors considered that the high surface area (673
(cid:0) 1) and high porosity favored the trapping of charges in the pores of
m2 g
silica-SBA-15, reducing the plasma discharge propagation and electric
field. Solid deposits were also observed on SBA-15 which modified the
plasma discharge formation and reduced the electric field intensity.

The author concluded that a high dielectric material with small pores
reduces  the  electric  field  of  the  plasma  due  to  the  accumulation  and
mutual  polarization  of  charges  inside  the  pores.  Low  dielectric  mate-
rials, despite their very small pores (20 nm for γ-alumina) improved the
strength of the electric field, enhancing surface discharge and methane
conversion.

Looking at the selectivities on Table 16, BaTiO3  exhibited the best

selectivity towards C2H2 and C2H4 despite its lowest conversion.

For  δ-alumina,  α-alumina,  and  silica-SBA-15,  the  same  trend  was
followed but to a lower extend. The authors did not comment on the
surface  chemical  properties  of  materials  (e.g.  acid  base  properties),
which could explain the results to a certain extent. The correlation of
methane  conversion  in  dry  reforming  process  as  well  as  methanol
selectivity with a dielectric constant of packed oxides was demonstrated
by N. Bouchoul et al. [120]. The activity was favored for the catalysts
with  low  dielectric  constants,  indicating  that  a  low  electric  field,
therefore low density of reactive species, was beneficial for the studied
reaction. Debek et al. [121] obtained a similar tendency in the carbon
dioxide  hydrogenation  under  plasma  coupled  to  catalysis:  carbon

3.4. Catalysts in the plasma-assisted oxidative coupling of methane

Most of the catalysts developed for plasma processes are transition
metal-based. Oxides of transition metals have been investigated in both
thermal catalysis and plasma catalysis, mainly due to their acid-base and
redox properties [39]. Efficient catalysts in the catalytic OCM reaction
are basic metal oxides. The addition of alkaline metals (lithium, sodium,
cesium)  to  magnesium  oxides  has  led  to  interesting  catalytic  perfor-
mances  and  C2  selectivity,  but  the  catalysts  were  not  stable  at  high
◦
temperatures (≥750
C) [122]. The acid-base properties and the oxygen
mobility are among the parameters favoring the OCM reaction. The rare
earth oxides are relatively more active than other alkaline oxides and
allow the production of C2+ hydrocarbons at lower temperatures. Sheng
C
et al. [123] showed that the non-oxidative methane coupling at 650
over Mo2C/[B]ZSM-5 catalyst produces ethylene with very high selec-
tivity (>90%). Nevertheless, the conversion of methane was limited at
1%.  In  order  to  enhance  catalytic  activity  in  long-running  processes,

they must be stable and resistant to abrasion and attrition loss. Addition
of a porous support, thermally stable and inert will avoid pressure drop
and catalyst fouling [9]. The catalytic activity (selectivity or yield) can
be strongly influenced by the chemical interactions between the active
catalyst component and the support, which depend on their chemical
nature [124].

Porous  support  materials  offer  potential  advantages  such  as  high
surface area, facile mass transport and homogeneous dispersion of active
sites.  Different  silicon  dioxide  materials  [125],  silicon  carbide  [126],
alumina [127] are common supports in the catalytic oxidative coupling
of methane.

In the plasma-assisted OCM, the supports are no different than those
used in the conventional catalytic process. Many studies have been re-
ported on the utilization of alumina either alone, as support for metal
oxides  or  in  the  presence  of  a  metal  (mainly  nickel).  It  is  worth
mentioning  that  nickel  on  alumina  catalysts  have  been  generally
employed for syngas production (in the presence of methane and carbon
dioxide  feed  but  not  at  an  optimal  ratio  to  produce  hydrocarbons).
However, some studies have reported relatively high C2 selectivities and
are included in the upcoming section.

3.4.1. Effect of alumina-based catalysts

3.4.1.1. Effect  of  alumina  catalysts. Li et al. [61] studied the effect of
alumina pellets in different types of plasma discharges on pure methane.
For  all  the  discharge  processes,  the  insertion  of  the  γ-alumina  pellets
increased methane conversion and C2 yield (Table 17). They highlighted
that  in  the  case  of  pulsed  streamer  discharge  plasma,  introducing
γ-alumina can decrease deposited carbon (estimated at 3% with catalyst
against 14% without catalyst) and improve C2 selectivity. Although the
highest CH4  conversion (35%) and C2  (25%) yield were registered for
the pulsed streamer discharge, the predominant product among C2  hy-
drocarbons was acetylene. Positive effects on alumina catalysts on the
conversion of methane were also shown by Kasinathan et al. [116] who
studied  the  non-oxidative  methane  activation  using  10%  methane  in
argon  in  a  DBD  reactor.  The  conversion  of  methane  over  alumina
reached 10.4% at 6 kV, as compared to 7.2% obtained with the plasma
alone. The acetylene and ethylene selectivities increased by ~20% when
an alumina catalyst was placed in the reactor, while the selectivity of
ethane dropped by approximately 20%. The same effect on the C2  hy-
drocarbons  selectivities  was  observed  by  Gallon  et  al.  [111].  When
alumina  catalyst  was  introduced  into  the  reactor,  it  caused  a  slight

decrease  in  ethane  selectivity  and  a  slight  increase  in  acetylene  and
ethylene selectivities.

The  α-  and  γ-alumina  grains  of  355–650  μm  were  compared  in
methane  coupling  using  carbon  dioxide  in  a  DBD  reactor  [120].  The
conversion  of  methane  was  greater  for  γ-alumina  (30%)  than  for
α-alumina (22%) owing to a higher degree of hydroxylation. As it was
suggested by Liu et al. [23], the materials with strong dipole character
and a great concentration of surface hydroxyls are easily charged. Once
the degree of polarization is excessive, dehydration may occur; leaving
oxygen  vacancies,  which  may  react  to  form  active  sites  for  methyl
radical generation. Considering the formation of hydrocarbons and ox-
ygenates, the catalysts showed selectivity mainly towards ethane: 8.8%
and  11%  for  γ-Al2O3  and  α-Al2O3,  respectively.  In  lesser  amount  the
catalysts exhibited the selectivity to ethylene, 0.3% and 1.0%; propane,
1.2%  and  0.7%;  methanol,  0.4%  and  0.5%;  formaldehyde,  0.9%  and
1.4%;  acetaldehyde,  0.2%  and  0.3%  for  γ-Al2O3  and  α-Al2O3,  respec-
tively, and C3H6O, 0.6% for both.

However, in some publications, the introduction of alumina particles
in the plasma volume of a methane and carbon dioxide mixture can also
have  a  negative  effect  on  the  methane  conversion  [105].  Recently,
Andersen et al. [128] observed a drop in methane conversion, ethylene
and acetylene total selectivity with the introduction of γ-alumina beads
(diameter 3.5–4.4 mm) compared to plasma alone in the reaction of dry
reforming of methane. The methane conversion and total ethylene and
acetylene  selectivity  were  32.5%  and  0.724%  for  plasma  only,  and
27.5% and 0.322% with alumina beads. While the selectivity to ethane
were not substantially different: 11.6% and 11.8% for plasma only and
with  γ-alumina,  respectively.  The  authors  attributed  the  decrease  in
methane conversion to the shorter residence time of the feed due to the
introduction of packing material. Despite the enhanced electric field at
the contact points of the catalyst, and thus increased electron temper-
ature  and  electron  impact  dissociation,  it  did  not  compensate  for  the
effect of a shorter residence time at the same power.

The  variability  of  the  results  obtained  for  the  alumina  catalysts
confirms  once  again  the  importance  of  the  catalyst  morphology,  and
most probably the nature of surface chemical species like the presence of
hydroxyl  groups  at  the  surface  of  γ-alumina.  These  results  were
explained in the early works of Liu et al. [23], who suggested that the
methane  conversion  to  higher  hydrocarbons  is  promoted  by  the  con-
centration  of  polarized  OH  groups.  Gadzhieva  et  al.  [129]  used  IR
spectroscopy  to  show  that  methane  adsorption  sites  are  formed  on
γ-alumina  by  molecular  and  dissociative  mechanisms  under  plasma

3.4.1.2. Effect of the metal over alumina. The interaction of plasma with
various noble (Pd, Pt) and non-noble metals (Ni, Cu ...) supported on
Al2O3  was investigated by different authors. In order to highlight the
effect of the metal, it is important to compare the results obtained in the
plasma - “metal over alumina” reaction to those obtained in the plasma -
“alumina alone” reaction. This comparison is not always possible, since
many authors studied the reaction directly in the presence of the metal
supported on alumina, failing to report the results without the metal. In
the  following  section,  the  data  with  plasma-alone  are  provided  for
comparison whenever the data with plasma-alumina alone is not indi-
cated.  As  previously  mentioned,  the  metal over  alumina  catalysts are
mainly used in the reforming reaction and are not optimized for high
yields of C2 hydrocarbons.

3.4.1.2.1. Effect of nickel over alumina. The results reported with Ni/
Al2O3 are summarized in Table 18. It was reported that adding nickel on
alumina enhances the conversion of methane and shows a synergistic
effect for methane conversion under plasma [101]. On the other hand,
the presence of nickel has a negative effect on C2 selectivity. However,
the reduction of nickel-alumina catalyst by methane in a DBD coaxial
reactor was reported to have a negative effect on methane conversion
[110,130]. Although the data without the catalyst were not reported,
the  authors  stated  that  the  presence  of  nickel  on  alumina  led  to  a
decrease in conversions of methane and carbon dioxide. These results
were explained by the discharge modifications inherent to the catalyst
packing in the plasma reactor [110]. Nickel contributed to the expansion
of the discharge and enhancement of charge transfer (Fig. 14). Antag-
onist effects were identified as: 1- filamentary micro-discharges fading
in detriment to weak filamentary and surface discharge, reducing the
plasma reactivity; 2- the presence of nickel on alumina favored the in-
tensity and spreading of surface discharges, thus reactivity, but without
counteracting totally the loss induced by the discharge alteration.

3.4.1.2.2. Effect of noble metals over alumina catalysts. The influence
of palladium on alumina was studied in a pulse corona plasma operating
under a methane and carbon dioxide feed [102], as detailed in Table 19.
A methane conversion of 43.3% and C2  selectivity of 30.6%, in which
acetylene was in proportion of 74% with only γ-alumina. In contrast, the
Pd/δ-Al2O3  catalyst  had  a  high  ethylene  content  (>65%)  with  C2
selectivity  of  ~40%.  The  Pd–La2O3/δ-Al2O3  catalyst  ended  with  the
highest C2 selectivity (70%) and high ethylene content (~65%), making
the Pd–La2O3/δ-Al2O3  catalyst a promising candidate in acetylene hy-
drogenation. A possible explanation of this effect comes from the po-
tential  interactions  between  lanthanum  oxide  and  alumina,  which
generates new active sites for the catalytic conversion of methane.

The combination of a gliding discharge with a mobile bed of catalyst
was studied by Mlotek et al. [131] using platinum and palladium sup-
ported on alumina  ceramic (size 0.16–0.315 mm) under a mixture  of
methane  and  hydrogen  (40  vol%  CH4).  The  results  showed  that  the
presence  of  the  noble  metal  did  not  change  the  global  methane  con-
version into C2  hydrocarbons, as compared to the bare support, but it

strongly  modified  the  distribution  of  C2  hydrocarbons:  acetylene  was
only produced over α-alumina while ethylene and ethane became the
main gaseous products over platinum and palladium. The highest yield
in ethane was obtained using Pd/α-Al2O3, which is consistent with the
literature  as  both  platinum  and  palladium  are  known  to  be  active  in
hydrocarbon  hydrogenation  reaction  [132].  Carbon  deposition  was
observed with high selectivity (27%) on bare α-alumina but decreased to
25% in the presence of palladium and to 16% in the presence of plat-
inum, due to the enhanced reaction of solid carbon with hydrogen in
presence  of  noble  metal,  producing  hydrocarbons.  The  influence  of
palladium on the alumina was studied in a pulse corona plasma oper-
ating  under a  methane  and  carbon  dioxide  feed  [102],  as  detailed  in
Table 19.

Using a DBD reactor, Jo et al. [133] confirmed that the presence of
platinum modifies the selectivity towards C2  hydrocarbons and favors
the production of ethane. However, methane conversion decreased to
12% with platinum compared to 13.5% with the bare support with beads
of 1 mm diameter due to the decrease in the electric field intensity in
presence of the noble metal.

The  author  used  a  Maxwell  program  and  a  simplified  model  con-
sisting of spherical alumina beads and platinum particles to calculate the
electric field. A strong and homogeneous electric field developed at the
contact surfaces of the alumina beads and in the space in close proximity
(Fig.  15).  When  the  metallic  particles  were  added,  the  electric  field
became highly distorted, being the strongest at the high voltage elec-
trode and the weakest at the ground. It resulted in a reduced propagation
of the electric field, thus hindering electron acceleration and tempera-
ture rise, which are essential for methane activation.

Taheraslani et al. [134] confirmed that the presence of palladium on

γ-alumina  enhanced  the  conversion  of  methane  in  the  dry  reforming
process using a DBD system compared to bare and with 10 wt% silver
impregnated supports. An opposite trend was observed when comparing
the selectivity to C2. In the defined conditions, the main C2  product in
the  gas phase was  ethane, with more than 10% selectivity  for all the
catalysts. The authors also reported the formation of higher hydrocar-
bons such as propane and isomers of butane and multiple liquid phase
products  such  as  methanol,  ethanol,  dimethyl  ether  and  formic  acid,
with similar selectivity for the different catalysts. They suggested that
the high-energy plasma facilitates the reforming reaction and promotes
interactions between the electrode surface and adsorbed species, leading
to  methane  decomposition  and  carbon  deposition.  The  latter  would
block  the  sites  for  further  reactions,  explaining  the  similarities  in
selectivity between these catalysts.

As  previous  authors  suggested,  the  modification  of  the  discharge
characteristics in the presence of a catalyst which in parallel enhances
the  activity,  affects  both  conversions  and  selectivities  according  to
defined plasma or chemical conditions.

3.4.1.2.3. Effect of other metals over alumina catalysts. The interac-
tion  of  plasma  with  various  other  metals  supported  on  alumina  was
investigated as summarized in Table 20. When compared to the empty
reactor or filled with alumina, the presence of iron had negative effects
on the conversion of methane and product selectivities. In the case of the
other  metals,  no  significant  effects  were  recorded  as  compared  to
alumina alone or the empty reactor. Overall, in the presence of carbon
dioxide, the catalysts supported on alumina do not provide satisfactory
results. Even though in some cases the textural properties of the catalysts
supported  on  alumina  were  very  similar  (specific  surface  area  in  the
(cid:0) 1, and average pore diameter 5.01–5.05 Å),
range of 144.5–151.4 m2 g
the results indicated that the effect of the catalysts did not depend on the
textural properties of the supported metal catalysts [101].

In contrast, 10 wt% copper on γ-alumina showed improved methane
conversion  in  dry  reforming  process  compared  to  alumina  alone,  but
quite comparable to results without packing material. The selectivity to

Fig.  15. Evolution  of  the  calculated  electric  field  in  the  DBD  reactor  packed
with Al2O3  beads (a) without and (b) with Pt. Applied voltage: 5 kV. Only the
electric field generated by external sources (i.e. applied voltage) is calculated.
Internal sources (induced by local differences in the distributions of ions and
electrons within the reactor) is too difficult to compute. The author considered
that  densities  of  the  ions  and  electrons  that  generate  such  fields  are  propor-
tional to the external applied voltage [133].

γ-alumina led to a decrease in methane conversion compared to the bare
support. However, the authors showed that palladium particles favored
the  production  of  unsaturated  hydrocarbons  (mainly  ethane)  and
limited  the  formation  of  carbon  deposits.  The  group  of  Lefferts  [30]
explained this effect by a fast hydrogenation rate of CHx and C2Hy on the
catalyst surface due to the presence of Pd, minimizing carbon deposi-
tion. A positive effect on product selectivities was also observed in the
presence of hydrogen. They investigated the effect of the catalytic layer
thickness on the walls of a structured reactor. The catalyst thickness did
not  influence  the  methane  conversion,  which  is  only  affected  by  the
plasma  properties,  but  it  did  influence  the  product  distribution.
Increasing  the  thickness,  i.e.  the  catalyst  loading  from  1.7  to  5.9  mg,
decreased  the  acetylene  formation  and  carbon  deposition,  while
increasing ethylene and ethane selectivities along with the other satu-
rated hydrocarbon. The same study reported improved performance of
structured catalyst (thin film on the reactor wall) compared to packed
material in a fixed-bed reactor. The authors suggested that the contact

C2 products was similar to alumina alone due to the presence of carbon
residues  blocking  the  active  site  as  already  mentioned.  In  addition,
copper-supported alumina showed significant enhancement of methanol
selectivity (not shown in Table 20) compared to alumina alone and other
deposited metals (3.16% compared to 1.17–1.40%). The highest meth-
anol selectivity was ascribed to a two-way mechanism: one is by the gas
phase  reaction  between  methyl  and  hydroxyl  radicals,  and  another,
surface-catalyzed  carbon  dioxide  activation  leading  to  formate,  a  pe-
culiarity known for Cu/Al2O3 from thermal catalysis. The combination
of copper with ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst registered the best results in terms of
conversion and selectivity under a mixture consisting of 50% methane,
12.5%  hydrogen  and  37.5%  argon  [107].  With  neutral  quartz  glass
packing, the overall products selectivity was slightly higher as compared
to an empty reactor. When the catalyst bed was present in the reactor,
the methane conversion was closer to that obtained for an empty reactor

than the reactor containing quartz glass. However, the presence of the
catalyst directly in the discharge zone resulted in approximately 20%
increase of C2 selectivity, improving the yield as compared to the empty
reactor and the reactor filled with quartz glass. For comparison, it would
have been interesting to see the results with alumina alone.

3.4.1.3. The influence of oxides over alumina support. The different oxide
catalysts supported on alumina are summarized in Table 21. Lanthanum
oxide is considered one of the most efficient oxide catalysts for oxidative
methane  coupling  and  has  been  investigated  by  several  groups.  They
have either examined the influence of lanthanum oxide weight percent,
or the effect of temperature. Zhang et al. [102] reported that all weight
percent  (5–12  wt%)  catalysts  provided  a  C2  hydrocarbon  selectivity
greater than 60%, but with a declining trend with increasing lanthanum
oxide  weight  percent,  while  the  methane  conversion  level  was

maintained at roughly 24%. No change was observed in the distribution
of C2 products, with acetylene being the major product independently of
the catalyst weight percent. It would have been interesting to see if and
how  the  plasma  power  was  influenced  by  the  weight  percent  of  the
catalyst, but unfortunately the authors did not provide this information.
Pham et al. [100] used a high loading of lanthanum oxide (40 wt%),
which was tested at different temperatures. The catalyst was supported
on alumina balls to avoid the use of a catalytic bed that would favor a
homogeneous  phase  reaction.  First,  the  authors  showed  that  at  room
temperature  the  presence  of  lanthanum  oxide  does  not  significantly
modify the methane and carbon dioxide conversions, or the hydrocar-
bon selectivity, the results being approximately the same as those ob-
tained  with  pure  alumina  balls.  The  methane  conversion  increased
slightly with the increase in temperature. Titanium oxide and magne-
sium oxide had the best catalytic activity among the oxides supported on
alumina, with ethane yields superior to the total yield of C2  products
obtained in the case of lanthanum oxide.

3.4.2. Effect of zeolite catalysts

The interest in zeolite as materials in plasma catalysis comes from
their  physico-chemical  characteristics  (permittivity,  acidity-basicity,
specific  surface).  Their  capacity  to  generate  a  plasma  with  a  strong
electric field near the pores of their micro- and nano-featured structures
allows reactions that thermal catalysis cannot provide [39].

3.4.2.1. Effect  of  coupling  zeolites  with  plasma. Modifications  of  the
zeolite support or of the supported metal properties have been the two
pathways  investigated  for  low-temperature  methane  conversion  over
zeolites.  The  electrical  charging  of  a  Y  zeolite  by  a  corona  discharge
modified its catalytic properties in terms of electrostatic potential and
work function at the surface [23].

A comparative investigation of plasma catalytic methane conversion
to  C2  hydrocarbons  over  different  kinds  of  zeolite  is  presented  in
Table 22. Zeolite X and Y are aluminosilicate molecular sieves with a
faujasite-type  structure  (FAU).  The  Si/Al  atomic  ratio  determines  the
zeolite designation as X for ratios in the 1 to 1.5 range and higher for Y-
type zeolite, with a high ratio being thermally stable [135,136].

The NaX zeolite slightly improved the selectivity of C2  products as
compared  to  the  empty  reactor.  The  NaY  zeolite  had  negative  effects
compared to plasma alone and a decrease in methane conversion and C2
selectivity was observed. When comparing the two zeolites in the same
conditions, the NaX zeolite performed better than the NaY, with a C2
yield of 16.2%, as compared to 12.1% for the NaY zeolite.

A  rather  complex  catalyst  based  on  modified  zeolite  Y  revealed  a
high conversion of methane into ethylene [137]. The material consisted
of oxalate ligand-functionalized copper modified zeolite Y (prepared via
the surface organometallic chemistry approach) resulting in 5 wt% Cu
incorporated into zeolite Y. Then the latter was modified using in high
frequency ultrasonic technique with Pt partially encapsulated onto CeO2

selectivity

powder (prepared by flame spray pyrolysis of Pt acetylacetonate with
CeO2). The author suggested that the high methane conversion (74%)
(~32%)  are  governed  by  a
and
strong-metal-support interaction, which shifted downward the d-band
center of Pt with respect to Fermi level. The consequence was a weak
adsorption of the C2H4 π-bond at the Pt site, preventing its hydrogena-
tion into ethane.

to  ethylene

Zeolite structural modifications by sodium hydroxide treatment aim
at dissolving part of the silicon to increase the catalyst’s polarizability
and basicity. The advantage of a high degree of polarization would be
the  formation  of  oxygen  vacancies  on  the  surface,  due  to  possible
dehydration, which would form an active site for CH3 radical formation,
as seen in previous section [23]. The sodium hydroxide-treated Y zeolite
registered  superior  results  in  terms  of  C2  selectivity  and  yield,  as
compared to the NaY zeolite. The results are even comparable to those
obtained using the NaX zeolite, since sodium-hydroxide treated Y has
the highest density of basic sites and NaX has the strongest basic sites. If
hydrogen  radicals  were  meant  to  promote  higher  hydrocarbons,  they
also led to polymerization, catalyst deactivation and low yields of higher
hydrocarbon. This effect was limited by the addition of oxygen, which
(cid:0)
generated active species like O
and OH radicals, maintaining the
sodium
discharge  and  avoiding  polymerization  within
hydroxide-treated Y zeolite.

3.4.2.2. Effect  of  coupling  metal/zeolite  with  plasma. A  comparative
study on plasma catalytic methane conversion to C2 hydrocarbons over
different metals supported on ZSM-5 zeolite in the presence of oxygen or
carbon  dioxide  [34]  is  summarized  in  Table  23.  Oxygen  in  the  feed
provides  active  oxygenated  species  that  enhance  methane  activation.
Adding  iron  enhanced  C2  selectivities  compared  to  the  sole  zeolite,
mainly acetylene and ethylene due to the presence of carbon monoxide
and carbon dioxide which affected the recombination of methyl and/or
ethyl radicals from methane conversion [34]. Nickel led to the smallest
C2 selectivities (ethylene or acetylene) compared to the other Fe- ZSM-5
catalysts, due to the loss of activity by oxidation of its surface. However,
the authors highlighted that despite a low conversion, the property of
nickel to generate C2  radicals from methane leads to intermediate spe-
cies, which are important in gas phase reactivity. The highest methane
conversion  was  obtained  with  Co-ZSM-5.  According  to  the  authors,
co-polymerization and coking enhanced the generation of C2 radicals in
hydrogen abstraction from methane. In the presence of Co-ZSM-5, C2
selectivity was found to be higher in microwave (MW) plasma (~90%)
compared  to  radiofrequency  (RF)  plasma  (62%)  despite  a  higher
methane conversion in RF plasma (RF = 78.4% against MW = 54.9%).
The  formation  of  COx  inhibiting  C2  products  was  pointed  out  as
responsible for this activity loss.

Comparing modified catalysts (NaX and NaOH treated Y), Na-ZSM-5
was the most acidic, which led to a poor plasma-catalytic activity [138].
Na-ZSM-5  catalyst  was  rapidly  deactivated  due  to  the  carbon

contamination  produced  during  the  plasma  reaction,  shifting  the
discharge propagation mode towards an arc. The overall activity was
reduced  in  this  case,  which  was  not  observed  in  the  other  zeolites.
Krawczyk et al. [105] observed similar carbon contamination and sug-
gested  that  soot  and  other  organic  compounds  (arising  from  higher
hydrocarbons) blocked the zeolite active centers (Fig. 16).

3.4.3. Effect of SBA-15 catalysts

In  heterogeneous  catalysis,  mesoporous  silica  (SBA-15)  gained
distinct attention as a promising catalyst and support due to its large
surface area, large pore size and high stability.

The group of Subrahmanyam [140] tested SBA-15 in methane OCM
in a DBD reactor, alone and with Pd-supported nanoparticles reduced by
conventional  thermal  treatment  and  by  in-situ  plasma  treatment
(Table  24).  The  authors  reported  the  formation  of  hydrogen,  carbon
monoxide,  carbon  dioxide  and  ethane,  with  the  largest  selectivity  to
ethane (17%) for SBA-15 sample alone and a methane conversion of 7%.
Pd-decorated samples showed improved conversion of methane (10%)
though lower selectivity towards ethane (12%), emphasizing the pres-
ence of secondary reactions, namely coupling, cleavage, H-transfer and
CO/CO2  hydrogenation, leading to the improvement of product selec-
tivity in the liquid phase (methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, ethanol
and acetone). A total liquid selectivity for in-plasma reduced Pt-SBA-15
was 70% (comparable to classical reduction of Pd), in contrast to 58%
for  SBA-15  alone.  The  adsorption-desorption  process  on  palladium,
being  an  active  site  with  basic  properties,  was  responsible  for  this
enhanced activity. In addition, the authors emphasized the formation of
oxygenates thanks to the mesopores of SBA-15. The decomposition of
adsorbed CHxO species to carbon monoxide is avoided since  the gen-
eration of plasma streamers is suppressed within small pores.

3.4.4. Effect of other metal oxides

The activity of different oxides such as BaO, La2O3, ZnO, CaO, MgO,
TiO2 and CeO2 was followed in the oxidative coupling of methane using
carbon  dioxide  in  a  DBD  reactor  at  a  fixed  power  of  8  W,  with  75%
helium [120]. The data are summarized in Table 25. The lowest reported
activity was with TiO2, reaching only 5.6% of methane conversion. The

conversion  of  methane  over  ZnO,  BaO  and  CeO2  were  improved
compared  to  TiO2,  resulting  in  14.9,  21.3  and  20.5%,  respectively.
However,  a  poor  carbon  balance  suggested  a  significant  amount  of
carbon deposition. The best results were obtained with CaO, La2O3 and
MgO with 25, 22 and 26% methane conversion, and 97, 93 and 89%
carbon balance, respectively. Regarding the hydrocarbons and oxygen-
ates  products,  the  catalysts  showed  mainly  selectivity  to  ethane
(8.8–13%).  To  a  minor  extent,  the  catalysts  showed  selectivity  to
ethylene  (0–0.5%),  propane  (0–1.4%),  methanol  (0–1.0%),  formalde-
hyde  (0–1.7%),  acetaldehyde  (0–0.3%)  and  C3H6O  (0–0.7%).  The
different  activities  in  methane  conversion  were  linked  to  the  permit-
tivity of the materials. The greater the permittivity, the lower the con-
version of carbon dioxide and methane, as seen previously.

The effect of cerium oxide in a Ni/C catalyst was examined for the
dry reforming of methane in a DBD plasma reactor [141]. The presence
of cerium oxide showed a strong interaction with nickel nanoparticles,
preventing their growth and improving the dispersion. Therefore, small
and  homogenously  distributed  nickel  nanoparticles  lowered  the  acti-
vation energy of methane, improving its conversion. The increase in the
cerium oxide molar ratio from 0 to 5% mol. in Ni/C led to a methane
conversion increase from 50.5 to 58.3%. On the other hand, the carbon
dioxide conversion increased with the increase of cerium oxide from 0 to
1% mol. and decreased at higher loadings. The increase in carbon di-
oxide  conversion  was  explained  by  the  positive  effect  of  strong  basic
sites inherent to cerium oxide, thus a good affinity to adsorb and activate
carbon dioxide. As for the drop of carbon dioxide conversion, it was due
to the shrinkage of specific surface area of the catalyst due to cerium
oxide size growth at higher loading. It resulted in a decrease of active
sites for carbon dioxide adsorption. Among the hydrocarbons, alkanes
were present as the main products with an increase in ethane selectivity
from 16.7 to 17.8% with higher cerium oxide content. The selectivity of
propane was as high as 4.5–5.7%, followed by unsaturated hydrocar-
bons: ethylene (~1%), acetylene (~1%) and propene (<0.5%).

Hu et al. [142] investigated the effect of cerium oxide prepared by
the hydrothermal method and 0.5 wt% Pd/CeO2 on methane conversion
at different external temperatures and in a nanosecond pulsed DBD. The
conversion  of  methane  was  greater  in  the  plasma-catalytic  system  at
980
C compared to catalytic system alone for both cerium oxide and
Pd/CeO2. Methane conversion of 5% and 11.5% for cerium oxide, 12.9%
and  23.6%  for  Pd/CeO2  was  obtained  without  and  with  plasma,
respectively. Both CeO2 and Pd/CeO2 catalysts, with or without plasma,
led to ethylene as the major C2 product (~10%), followed by acetylene
(~4%) and ethane (<1%). This indicates that plasma and the presence
of palladium activate methane and influence the formation of methyl
radicals,  but do  not  influence subsequent  reactions. Nevertheless,  the
selectivity  was  strongly  influenced  by  the  external  temperature.  The
◦
conversion of methane increased with the temperature rise from 800
C
◦
to 900
C, compromising the selectivity to hydrocarbons and increasing
the  selectivity  to  hydrogen,  indicating  carbon  deposition  at  higher
temperatures.  Nevertheless,  compared  to  conventional  catalysis,  the

addition of plasma increased the catalyst’s coke-resistance.

Another CeO2-based system was studied by the group of S. Kawi [29]
on  non-oxidative  coupling  of  methane  at  low  temperature,  using  a
mixture of CH4/He in 1/1 ratio (total flux: 20 ml min-1). The authors
compared the activity of atomically dispersed single atoms (Pt/CeO2--
SAC) prepared by atom-trapping method and nanoparticles of Pt species
(Pt/CeO2-NP). The conversion of methane and yield to C2 products at 72
W applied power in a mixture of CH4/He over a Pt-single atom were
greater (43% and 20%) compared to plasma alone (35% and 6%), CeO2

(35% and 8%) and nanoparticulate Pt over CeO2  (40% and 14%). The
authors  suggested  that  the  presence  of  uncoordinated  Pt  species  can
convert vibrationally excited methane, that usually does not contribute
significantly to the methyl radical formation (<1%) compared to elec-
tronically excited methane, but consumes more than 50% of total energy
provided to the system. As a result, vibrationally excited methane can be
dissociated over single atoms of Pt and CH3*-, CH2*- and CH*- moieties
are  involved  in  the  coupling  process  over  two  neighboring  Pt  sites,
avoiding the formation of coke and oligomerization. After 2 h of reaction

at  54  W,  the  spent  catalyst  revealed  the  presence  of  Pt  nanoclusters
instead of uncoordinated Pt species, which explains why C2  selectivity
has  decreased  since  unselective  coke  formation  over  Pt  nanoparticles
favors  deep  dehydrogenation.  Table  26  provides  a  summary  of  the
findings.

3.5. Post-plasma catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane

Post-plasma palladium catalysts were also tested for the production
of C2 hydrocarbons from methane. Delikonstantis et al. [143] reported
an optimized nanosecond pulsed discharge reactor with a post plasma
catalyst in terms of energy cost and selectivity to acetylene by varying
flow rate, flow and catalyst composition and inter-electrode gap. Based
on their findings and the data reported in the literature, a comparison
was  drawn  between  the  different  2-stage  setups  (plasma  followed  by
catalyst) and displayed in Table 27.

The hybrid reactor [143] showed the best ethylene performance in
terms  of  energy  cost  as  compared  with  the  other  systems  despite  its
lower yield. Though the advantage of gas recirculation in the AC plasma
catalytic  reactor  [144]  should  be  taken  into  account.  In  fact,  the
improved collision probability of methane molecules with the plasma
led  to  higher  conversion  (66–74%  for  recycle  ratios  from  0  to  4),
lowering the energy cost from 10.6 eV/molecule to 9.3 eV/molecule in
this specific case. The yield of ethylene in the recycle plasma reactor
reached 55% with a Pd based catalyst. The author also reported good
selectivity for ethylene (35%) and other C3–C5 light olefins (23%) on a
cheaper catalyst based on nickel-zinc in the hydrogenation of acetylene.
Palladium  supported  catalyst  is  commonly  used  for  the  selective
hydrogenation  of  small  amounts  of  acetylene  in  the  purification  of
ethylene. The silver-palladium catalysts following a spark discharge can
give  ethylene  yields  up  to  50–60%  [51,144,145].  The  addition  of
palladium  to the NaOH-treated Y-zeolite  allowed the selective  hydro-
genation of acetylene to ethylene but at a low yield (19.3%) and high
energy cost as compared with the other processes [147]. The addition of
a catalyst in post discharge presents undeniable advantages for ethylene
production since single plasma favors acetylene selectivity. Combining
gas  recirculation  with  an  optimized  hybrid  reactor  would  be  a  good
solution to improve both ethylene yield and lower energy costs.

4. Compiling plasma alone and plasma-catalysis results

Numerous  plasma-assisted  processes  have  been  investigated  and
proposed for the coupling of methane to C2 added value products. Hy-
bridization of plasma and catalyst into one system does provide a syn-
ergistic result for activation at low temperatures. It has the potential to
enhance  the  conversion  of  methane  and  to  improve  the  selectivity

toward the desirable C2 products, but it is not all that elementary. The
reviewed  studies  have  shown  a  positive  effect  of  plasma–catalysis
combination processes on the methane coupling reaction. However, the
combined data plotted in Fig. 17 shows a large array of scattered results
from the plasma-alone and the plasma-catalytic processes. It reveals how
strongly interconnected all the parameters described in this review are.
In any plasma-catalytic process, the complexity of the catalyst sur-
face  and  gas-phase  chemistry  are  strongly  correlated  to  the  physical
properties of the individual plasma and catalyst. First of all, the com-
parison of different plasma sources is challenging since the reactors, the
generators and discharge characteristics (specific energy, electron en-
ergy distribution and electron density) differ strongly from one study to
another. Second of all, the target products and the chosen methodologies
to  determine  their  presence  and  concentration  differ  as  well.  Some
literature reports are either incomplete or inaccurate and may lead to
early  conclusions.  The  specific  energy  input  represents  a  suitable
parameter  for  the  comparison  of  the  data (Fig.  18),  even though  this
parameter is not present in every publication reported. The plasma alone
and the plasma-catalytic processes, for which SEI has been provided or
(cid:0) 1 of methane feed.
determined, have values varying from 1 to 512 kJ L
The methane conversion for plasma alone is usually below 50% for SEI
(cid:0) 1  and the selectivities for C2  products are over
values up to ~64 kJ L
(cid:0) 1, higher
40%. However, for SEI values varying from 64 to 512 kJ L
conversions of methane (>50%) were achieved, but the selectivities of
C2 products dropped, in some cases, to under 50%.

Most of the data in the plasma-catalytic processes is comprised be-
(cid:0) 1, but with conversion and selectivity below 50%.
tween 4 and 64 kJ L
The SEI range has an effect on methane conversion and C2  selectivity,
both in plasma alone and in plasma-catalytic systems: low SEI will favor
high selectivities but low conversions, while high SEI will increase the
conversion  but  lower  the  selectivity.  C2  yield  as  a  function  of  SEI
(Fig. 19) highlights that both plasma and plasma-catalysis processes are
efficient  to  produce  light  hydrocarbons  and  some  publications  have
shown enhanced C2 yield at moderate energy input.

Various types of plasma for methane conversion into higher hydro-
carbons yield different performances in terms of conversion, energy cost
and selectivity towards hydrocarbons. For this reason, it is important to
have a clear understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each
type of discharge. Major advantages of cold plasma techniques are the
low operating temperature, the low thermal inertia and the fast response
to fluctuating or intermittent operating conditions. The specific energy
input is the best indicator of the process efficiency, as it changes with
each  variable  parameter.  The  advantage  of  glidarc,  microwave  and
spark discharges is linked to their characteristics as they are warm and
dense plasma. The pulsed nanodischarge approach seems promising as it

results in high energy efficiency.

The addition of gases to the methane feed changes the reactivity of
the system, which can have considerable effects on the methane con-
version, carbon deposition or selectivities to final reaction products. The
non-oxidative  methane  coupling  is  performed  with  additives  like
hydrogen,  nitrogen  or  noble  gases.  Even  though  the  additive  gas  can
have positive effects on the methane conversion, the cost (especially for
the noble gases) and the formation of undesired products (mostly in the
case  of  nitrogen)  must  be  considered.  Hydrogen  seems  promising  for
methane conversion, but the product selectivities can be shifted only by
a combined effect of hydrogen content in the feed and plasma reactor
pressure.  Concerning  the  oxidative  coupling  of  methane,  oxygen  is
considered effective for the activation of methane and the reduction of
carbon  contamination. However,  excessive  oxidation  leads to  the  for-
mation of carbon dioxide and a wide variety of oxygenated products that
limit selectivity to C2. The use of carbon dioxide as a milder oxidant may
sometimes be preferable for the activation of methane, but it also leads
to  the  production  of  syngas  and  oxygenated  compounds.  The  plasma
chemistry in the presence of an oxidant is quite complex and, until now,
its  understanding  remains  limited.  Understanding  the  underlying
plasma chemistry in the oxidative or non-oxidative coupling of methane
is  of  great  interest  in  the  optimization  of  this  technology,  especially
when the aim is to include a catalyst for the improvement of product
yields.

Packing material into the discharge affects the electric field, the gas
breakdown voltage and plasma behavior. It also modifies the electron
density and electron energy distribution. Many factors, such as particle
size,  shape,  structure,  chemical  nature  and  location  (and  hence  the
volume  fraction  of  the  packed  material  in  the  discharge  area)  may
improve  the  overall  processing  performance  compared  to  plasma  or
catalyst taken separately. These results are particularly interesting and
future  research  should  focus  on  this  type of  discharges  in  association
with  optimized  catalytic  phases.  Dielectric  constants  and  pore  sizes
contribute to the performance of the plasma by changing its electrical
properties  and  propagation  mode.  The  availability  of  plasma  species
inside the pore is of significant importance, as their interaction with the
surface might affect the morphology and work function of the catalyst,
influencing its performance. Moreover, if the plasma species can exist
inside the pores, it will increase the active surface of the catalyst that can
participate in the reactions. The favored packing materials must have a
low  dielectric  constant,  high  surface  area,  facile  mass  transport  and
homogeneous  dispersion  of  active  sites.  The  catalytic  activity  can  be
influenced  by  strong  metal  support  interactions  between  the  active
catalyst component and the support. Novel design of efficient catalysts
for the coupling of methane assisted by plasma requires deeper inves-
tigation of the surface effects such as oxygen vacancy, acid–base prop-
erty,  surface  oxide  reducibility  and  most  importantly,  how  they
influence and/or react with the plasma reactive species.

The synergism that originates from the complex plasma-catalyst in-
teractions  still  represents  a  challenge  of  understanding.  Plasma  and
catalyst characteristics and reactivities are interconnected. Plasma in-
duces modifications in morphology, chemistry and surface work func-
tion,  altering  activity.  Catalyst  properties  such  as  dielectric  constant,
acidity-basicity  or  structure  affect  plasma  properties  near  the  surface
such  as  the  electric-field  distribution,  surface  charging  and  electron-
energy  distribution.  Many  efforts  have  been  carried  out  to  integrate
plasma and catalysis in one step since it modifies selectivity to desired
products, as well as energy efficiency. Moreover, the catalyst generates a
wider variety of reaction products as compared to plasma alone.

Considering the current results from a cost perspective, a consider-
able advantage of the plasma alone process is that no catalyst is involved
in the reaction therefore, the operation of the plasma reactor is stable

and  the  process  is  easy  to  integrate.  The  challenges  associated  with
catalyst utilization, such as catalyst activation, regeneration, poisoning
and aging, consist in avoiding the disruption of the continuous opera-
tion. The process is still confronted to the formation of carbonaceous
residue leading to the decrease of reactor performances and eventually
to discharge extinction.

Reaching  high  energy  efficiency  is  the  biggest  challenge  to  the
industrialization  of  the  plasma  process.  Although  it  is  considered  by
many  that  the  integration  of  plasma  and  catalysis  can  lead  to  a  high
energy efficiency, the critical selectivity/conversion limitations related
to the experiments have led to the conclusion that, for the moment, the
use of plasma-catalytic systems does not achieve favorable energy effi-
ciencies as compared to the plasma process alone or thermal catalysis. In
order  to  define  appropriately  the  energy  efficiency,  its  calculation
should also be internationally standardized. Although various innova-
tive strategies in catalyst synthesis, plasma reactor type and configura-
tion have been employed in order to achieve oxidative or non-oxidative
methane  coupling  with  high  and  stable  C2  yield,  the  improvement
achieved so far is not significant enough to take the process to an in-
dustrial and economically viable stage. It is still essential to accurately
characterize and strengthen the understanding of the reaction mecha-
nisms of plasma coupling with catalysis, before considering scaling up
the process. The understanding of plasma-catalytic mechanisms occur-
ring  in  such  complex  systems  still  requires  the  development  of  new
approaches  and  techniques  to  provide  insight  into  the  associated
fundamental  phenomena  and  plasma-catalyst  interaction.  Answers  to
queries  on  the  behavior  of  the  plasma  process  and  surface  reaction
should come from additional research (experimental and modeling) on
the propagation of the discharge in the porosity of the material.
