Smouldering combustion is an important and complex phenomenon that is central to a wide range of 
problems (hazards) and solutions (applications). A rich history of research in the context of ﬁre safety 
has yet to be integrated with the more recent, rapidly growing body of work in engineered smouldering 
solutions. The variety of disciplines, materials involved, and perspectives on smouldering have resulted in 
a lack of unity in the expression of key concepts, terminology used, interpretation of results, and conclu- 
sions extracted. This review brings together theoretical, experimental, and modelling studies across both 
ﬁre safety and applied smouldering research to produce a uniﬁed conceptual understanding of smoulder- 
ing combustion. The review includes ( i ) an overview of the fundamental processes with a synthesis of 
nomenclature to generate a consistent set of terms for these fundamental processes, ( ii ) a distillation of 
ignition, extinction, and transition to ﬂaming research, ( iii ) a review of the temporal and spatial distribu- 
tion of heat and mass transfer processes as well as their solution using analytical and numerical methods, 
( iv ) an overview of smouldering emissions and emission treatment systems, and ( v ) a summary of key 
gaps and opportunities for future research. Beyond merely review, a new conceptual model is provided 
that articulates similarities and critical differences between the two main smouldering systems: porous 
solid fuels and condensed fuels in inert porous media. A quantitative analysis of this conceptual model 
reveals that the evolution of a smouldering front, while a local process, is determined by a global energy 
balance that is cumulative in time and has to be integrated in space. As such, the fate of a smoulder- 
ing reaction can be predicted before the effects of global heat exchange have impacted the reaction. This 
approach is relevant to all forms of smouldering (including ﬁre safety), but it is particularly important 
when using smouldering as an engineered process that results in the positive use of the energy released 
by the smouldering reaction (applied smouldering). In applied smouldering, predicting the fate of a re- 
action ahead of time allows operators to modify the conditions of the process to maintain self-sustained 
smouldering propagation and thus fully harness the beneﬁts of the reaction.

1. Introduction 

Smouldering combustion is a fascinating, important, and com- 
plex phenomenon. It has played a key role in the relationship be- 
tween humans and ﬁre for millennia [1 , 2] and is recognized as a 
natural part of terrestrial ecosystems [3] . Smouldering as a com- 
bustion  problem  was  ﬁrst  acknowledged  by  Palmer  [4]  and  has 
been studied mostly in the context of ﬁre safety because it is rec- 
ognized as a relevant process of destructive ﬁres. Applied smoul- 
dering is now emerging as a tool for engineers to address a wide 
range of environmental and industrial challenges. 

Smouldering – combustion in the absence of ﬂames – has been 
studied from many perspectives and in many contexts: from mi- 
croscopic considerations (single grain or pore) to peat mega-ﬁres 
smouldering across hundreds of thousands of hectares; from nat- 
ural  convection  in  foam to  forced convection  in  cigarettes;  from 
unintentional self-heating of waste piles to intentional treatment 
of contaminated soil; from out-of-control underground coal seam 
ﬁres to intentional applications for underground oil and gas recov- 
ery. It has been studied in micro-gravity, analysed with combustion 
theory, modelled with simple and complex approaches, and scaled 
up by 5 orders of magnitude from laboratory to ﬁeld-scale applica- 
tions. The disciplines taking interest in smouldering extend beyond 
the  ﬁre  and  combustion  communities  to  chemistry,  soil  science, 
energy, space engineering, heat transfer, mechanical engineering, 
petroleum engineering, hydrogeology, environmental engineering, 
and porous media processes amongst others. 

The variety of disciplines, materials involved and perspectives 
on smouldering phenomena has resulted in a lack of unity in the 
expression of key concepts, in the terminology used, in the inter- 
pretation of the results, and in the conclusions extracted. Smoul- 
dering has been named in situ combustion, glowing combustion, 
ﬁre ﬂooding, and ﬁltration combustion in different contexts. There 
are many ideas in the literature that could appear contradictory 
and many questions that remain unresolved. The recent introduc- 
tion of applied smouldering research is informed by, and also in- 
forms, traditional smouldering research, yet the results of research 
in this area are not reguarly integrated with other smouldering re- 
lated ﬁndings. 

The  complexity  of  smouldering  processes  relative  to  those  of 
ﬂaming  combustion,  and  the  nuanced  interplay  of  physical  and 
chemical processes in smouldering, changes the scope of the nec- 
essary science. Traditional smouldering analyses emphasize the im- 
portance of local and temporal phenomena as is commonly done 
for most combustion processes. However, there is limited appre- 
ciation for the fact that smouldering behaviour at the scale of a 
system depends on the integral, in space and time, of many key 
processes. Smouldering is a process that is deﬁned by the result 
of continual feedback between heat and mass transfer processes 
and chemical kinetics that can determine the fate of smouldering 
and its propagation. The outcomes can be drastically different: in- 
creasing temperatures leading to super-adiabatic conditions and/or 
ﬂaming, self-sustaining propagation with steady temperatures, or 
decaying propagation leading to extinction. As a result of our dis- 
jointed understanding of smouldering, our ability to interpret con- 
ditions, recommend actions, and intentionally control smouldering 
is limited. On one hand, a smouldering reaction may be considered 
weak, with relatively low temperatures and propagation rates that 
suggest it is perpetually on the verge of quenching. On the other 
hand, the same reaction may be recognized as remarkably robust 
with the potential to sustain itself for centuries with no interven- 
tion, or even survive every attempt at suppression. 

As a discipline, ﬁre science still has much unresolved complex- 
ity relative to most others [5] . And, despite being one of the most 
relevant and complex ﬁre processes, smouldering science has re- 
ceived  much  less  attention  than  most  other  aspects  of  ﬁre  [6] . 
Smouldering has always had a relatively minor proﬁle in the ﬁre 
discipline. However, that is changing. In the 1950s and 60 s, the 
percentage of ﬁre papers about smouldering was virtually zero. De- 
spite a rapid rise in the total number of ﬁre papers, the percent- 
age about smouldering increased to 0.08% by 1970, to 0.8% by 1980 
and to over 1% in 2018. The ﬁrst substantial review of smouldering 
appeared in 1985: a pioneering study by Ohlemiller [7] that pro- 
vided the ﬁrst theoretical framework to describe smouldering com- 
bustion.  Subsequent  reviews  [6 , 8 , 9]  present  summaries  of  stud- 
ies  conducted  after  1985  but  retain  the  framework  proposed  by 
Ohlemiller [7] .

All previous reviews agree that the universal characteristic of 
smouldering is the presence of a porous medium of suﬃcient per- 
meability to air, ensuring suﬃcient oxygen is available to the re- 
action. That oxygen diffuses into the surface of the reacting fuel, 
driving its exothermic oxidation. When the rate of heat generated 
and retained exceeds that lost to endothermic processes and the 
environment, smouldering can be self-sustaining. 

Traditionally, smouldering research focused on porous solid fu- 
els  (hereafter  referred  to  as  PSFs).  These  include  textiles  (linen, 
cotton, wool, paper, leather), synthetic materials (expanded ther- 
mosetting  plastics,  polyurethane  foam,  foam  rubber,  polyisocy- 
naurate foams, phenolformaldehyde foams, wood ﬁbre insulation 
boards), fuels (coal, charcoal, wood, granular carbon), plants and 
grains  (tobacco,  hay,  brewing  grains,  sawdust),  soils  (peat,  forest 
litter  such  as  leaves  and  pine  needles),  and  foods  (corn  starch, 
sugar, ﬁsh meal). The primary objective was to understand the risk 
of ﬁre from PSFs and consider means to prevent ignition (includ- 
ing self-ignition) or achieve suppression [10-21] . The potential for 
cigarettes to cause ignition of bedding and upholstery is a classic 
example [22-27] . Also studied in this context was oil-soaked ‘lag- 
ging’ (pipe insulation), one of the few cases in which liquids were 
considered  the  fuel  [3 , 28] .  Given  that  the  motivation  for  study- 
ing smouldering has been intimately related to the material burn- 
ing, smouldering literature is very material speciﬁc. Most studies 
address issues pertaining to a speciﬁc material, and only in very 
few occasions are conclusions drawn that have explicit applicabil- 
ity across different materials. 

Two key aspects of smouldering that make it such a serious ﬁre 
risk are ( i ) it can initiate from heat sources that are insuﬃcient 
to cause ﬂaming, and ( ii ) once initiated it is extremely diﬃcult to 
suppress [7 , 17] . Thus, smouldering is known to be responsible for 
recurrent coal seam ﬁres burning for centuries [29 , 30] and for peat 
megaﬁres visible from space [14] , both with extremely serious im- 
plications for environmental and human health. 

Recently,  smouldering  has  been  recognized  as  a  process  that 
can be harnessed for human beneﬁt. The reasons why it is such 
a  persistent  ﬁre  risk  also  underlie  its  value  in  applications;  for 
example,  materials  that  have  too  low  caloriﬁc  value  or  are  too 
wet to ﬂame can be smouldered. Since the process can be engi- 
neered  to  be  self-sustaining,  it  can  have  a  very  low  energy  and 
carbon  footprint.  When  used  for  waste  management,  for  exam- 
ple,  the  competing  technologies  are  usually  thermal  processes, 
such  as  pyrolysis,  volatilization,  or  incineration.  These  processes 
are energy intensive because they are endothermic and/or suffer 
from  signiﬁcant  heat  losses.  The  large  and  unmanageable  losses 
often  result  in  the  need  for  continuous  inputs  of  supplemental 
heat or fuel. Applied smouldering is also highly controllable, since 
the rate of fuel consumption is generally proportional to the air 
mass ﬂow rate [7] and this is easily controlled in engineered sys- 
tems.  These  advantages  suggest  that  smouldering  presents  sig- 
niﬁcant  beneﬁts  for  those  responsible  for  combustible  materials 
that  need  disposal,  volume  reduction,  and/or  conversion  to  heat 
and gas. 

There  are  many  examples  of  applied  smouldering.  Use  of  in 
situ combustion, or ﬁre-ﬂooding, to recover crude oil from reser- 
voirs  has  been  extensively  investigated  (e.g.,  [31-39] ).  This  has 

been  combined  with  other  approaches,  such  as  steam  injection, 
to  maximize  oil  production  ahead  of  the  combustion  front  [34] . 
Smouldering  has  also  been  proposed  for  recovering  metals  from 
heavy oil waste [40] , for sintering of iron ore [41 , 42] , for under- 
ground coal gasiﬁcation [43] , for landmine detection [44] , for re- 
cycling shredded tires [45] , and for reducing the volume of land- 
ﬁlls [46] . Smouldering has been applied commercially for in situ 
(i.e.,  on  site,  below  ground)  remediation  of  industrially  polluted 
soil  [47-54] .  Commercial  smouldering  systems  have  been  devel- 
oped to treat waste industrial liquids, such as crude oil tank bot- 
toms, in above ground systems [55] . In addition, smouldering has 
been proposed for managing sewage sludge (in some cases termed 
biosolids), the dominant waste from wastewater treatment plants 
[56] , and for recovering energy from pine bark waste [57] . Recently 
smouldering  has  been  applied  as  an  energy  eﬃcient  destruction 
technique for human faeces [58-61] . This has led to the develop- 
ment of a continuous smouldering reactor that recovers and reuses 
the excess energy as part of an innovative, off-grid toilet designed 
to  address  the  sanitation  challenges  of  impoverished  countries 
[62] . 

Applied smouldering requires a thorough understanding of the 
process in order to optimize the operational conditions in the con- 
text of an industrial application. In several of the cases above, the 
fuel  is  a  liquid  (e.g.,  coal  tar,  creosote,  petroleum  hydrocarbons) 
that is found already embedded in a porous medium (soil). How- 
ever, in other applications (e.g., crude oil, biosolids, pine bark, fae- 
ces) the fuel is intentionally mixed with an inert porous medium, 
such  as  quartz  sand.  In  contrast  to  PSF,  these  systems  will  be 
collectively referred to as Condensed Fuels in Inert Porous Media 
(CFIPM). All of these smouldering applications employ a relatively 
short, intentional ignition event followed by a forced, continued air 
supply. CFIPM present some different conditions than PSF in tradi- 
tional smouldering studies, including different heat transfer char- 
acteristics, much lower porosity (e.g., 98% in polyurethane foam vs. 
35% in sand), lower permeability to air, and higher airﬂow rates 
(resulting in, for example, reduced buoyancy effects). Also, sensi- 
tivity to key process variables is important, such as moisture con- 
tent and enriched oxygen concentration; variables that are less rel- 
evant  to  a  ﬁre  safety  context.  Moreover,  a  substantial  subset  of 
ﬁre safety studies have studied opposed smouldering, where the 
oxygen feeding the reaction is ﬂowing in the direction opposite to 
the reaction’s propagation. In contrast, engineered smouldering re- 
search focuses on forward smouldering, where air is injected be- 
hind the front and ﬂows in the same direction as the propagating 
reaction. 

Taken together, the wide range of available studies provide a 
comprehensive picture of the different processes affecting smoul- 
dering.  However,  these  studies  have  not  been  synthesized  into 
a  holistic  understanding  of  smouldering.  This  review  aims  to 
bring  together  the  diversity  of  studies  – theoretical,  experimen- 
tal,  and  modelling  – across  both  natural  and  engineered  smoul- 
dering  research  to  produce  a  uniﬁed  conceptual  understanding 
of smouldering combustion. While recognizing that different ma- 
terials  will  emphasize  or  de-emphasize  certain  phenomena,  this 
review  will  focus  on  a  conceptual  understanding  and  therefore 
will  only  use  material  dependant  studies  to  illustrate  speciﬁc 
phenomena.  This  will  inevitably  exclude  certain  studies  where 
the  phenomena  has  already  been  described  by  means  of  exam- 
ples  illustrated  by  different  materials.  A  novel  aspect  of  this  re- 
view  is  to  articulate  the  state  of  the  art  in  considering  smoul- 
dering  as  an  energy  balance  integrated  in  time  and  space.  This 
conceptual  model  has  important  implications  for  managing  ﬁre 
risk  and  effectively  harnessing  smouldering  to  solve  engineering 
challenges. 

The framework for discussion is one-dimensional smouldering. 
However,  many  of  the  concepts  are  relevant  to  the  spectrum  of

conditions  including multi-dimensional smouldering.  The  general 
framework  proposed  here  is  based  on  a  smouldering  front  that 
spans the sample cross-section utilizing oxygen delivered through 
the effective porosity of the porous medium to the reaction zone. 
Surface smouldering, such as that which occurs on the surface of 
wood or incense is a limit state of this process. Numerous stud- 
ies have examined these valuable phenomena and two excellent 
examples (e.g., [7 , 63] ), serve to illustrate this limit behaviour. Nev- 
ertheless, the ﬂow ﬁelds and the PSF characteristics of such sys- 
tems are relatively unique and are not truly related to smoulder- 
ing but to the external ﬂows induced by the environment and/or 
the smouldering front. Therefore, this limit behaviour represents a 
special case outside a general conceptual understanding of smoul- 
dering, and thus it is only covered brieﬂy. 

Section  2  provides  essential  background  and  introduces  key 
processes and nomenclature. It serves to introduce main concepts 
that are expanded upon in subsequent sections. The nomenclature 
establishes  a  consistent  terminology  used  throughout  the  paper. 
Moreover, this section summarizes the stoichiometry and kinetics 
of smouldering chemistry. This is a highly studied ﬁeld and the re- 
view attempts to summarize the diversity of approaches and high- 
light the costs and beneﬁts of the degree of complexity included 
in kinetic schemes. 

Section 3 summarizes the research into ignition and extinction. 
It discusses the traditional, local analyses of ignition and extinc- 
tion. Moreover, it highlights both theoretical consideration and ex- 
perimental  studies  of  ignition  and  extinction.  Key  dimensionless 
numbers in smouldering are reviewed and linked to the concepts 
in this section. Finally, the topic of the transition of smouldering to 
ﬂaming combustion is reviewed. 

Section  4  presents  a  general  conceptual  model  of  smoulder- 
ing combustion, detailing key similarities and differences between 
PSF  and  CFIPM  systems.  Moreover,  it  presents  these  in  the  con- 
text of understanding smouldering as a process that depends on 
heat  and  mass  transfer  processes  integrated  in  time  and  space. 
The  traditional  local  energy  balance  is  discussed  in  the  context 
of  a  bed-integrated,  (i.e.,  global)  energy  balance  for  the  system. 
The  global  energy  balance  concept  is  then  presented  as  cen- 
tral to differentiating a self-sustaining from a non-self-sustaining 
smouldering  system.  This  conceptual  model  is  new  and  articu- 
lates  an  understanding  of  smouldering  that  has  emerged  from 
the  extensive  body  of  research  underlying  this  review.  The  en- 
ergy balance concept is then employed to explain the role of heat 
losses,  of  ignition,  and  of  extinction  on  the  self-sustainability  of 
a smouldering system. Moreover, the concept of smouldering ro- 
bustness – as a measure of how far system conditions are from 
extinction  – is  articulated  in  the  context  of  a  system  energy 
balance. 

Section 5 focuses on smouldering emissions, the sensitivity of 
emissions to fuel types and smouldering characteristics, and emis- 
sion treatment systems. Particular attention is given to the emis- 
sions of metals and nitrous oxides. The review concludes by sum- 
marizing the research gaps and opportunities for the smouldering 
ﬁeld, covering hazard management as well as practical applications 
moving forward. 

Self-propagating  high-temperature  synthesis  (SHS)  [64-67] , 
packed  bed  incinerators  [68-70] ,  porous  media  burners  [71 , 72] 
and  ﬁxed  bed  catalytic  reactors  [73 , 74]  amongst  others  are  pro- 
cess  that  share  many  commonalities  with  smouldering  combus- 
tion and have led to important breakthroughs in the understand- 
ing of smouldering. As such, relevant information from these ar- 
eas  of  research  will  be  invoked  throughout  this  review.  Nev- 
ertheless,  extensive  literature  that  includes  many  review  papers 
have  been  published  on  these  subjects;  therefore,  a  review  of 
these research areas will be considered outside the scope of this 
study. 

2. Fundamental processes 

2.1. Key processes 

Smouldering combustion differs from other forms of combus- 
tion  (premixed  combustion,  non-premixed  ﬂaming  combustion, 
etc.)  in  several  key  ways.  First,  smouldering  characteristic  time 
scales are consistent with diffusive processes. Characteristic rates 
for radiative and convective transport as well as reaction rates can 
all be quantiﬁed by diffusive approximations [7 , 75] . Heat exchange 
minimizes losses by radiation, conduction, and convection allow- 
ing chemical reactions to proceed at rates and temperatures typ- 
ically  too  low  to  sustain  other  combustion  processes.  A  second 
unique feature of smouldering combustion is that different reac- 
tions can occur simultaneously but spatially distributed in regions 
that do not necessarily correspond to the region of maximum tem- 
perature. In ﬂaming combustion, reactions are also spatially dis- 
tributed but around the region of maximum temperature. There- 
fore,  in  traditional  combustion  processes,  the  ﬂame  thickness  is 
very  thin,  so  all  chemical  processes  compete  in  close  proximity. 
The spatial distribution of the chemical reactions in smouldering 
can result in the suppression of some reactions and the promo- 
tion of others at very different locations. This spatial distribution 
can affect heat and mass transfer processes as well as the resul- 
tant  products  of  combustion.  Third,  in  smouldering,  the  porous 
medium serves as a heat exchanger; therefore, ﬁltration and con- 
densation/recondensation  are  common  mechanisms  that  further 
complicate the spatial distribution of the reactions. The result is 
a temporal evolution of the smouldering front, and of the prod- 
ucts generated, as the front progresses. While the chemical mech- 
anisms associated with any combustion process might be relevant 
for smouldering, these particular features of smouldering can re- 
sult in outputs that are very different from any conventional com- 
bustion process. 

Smouldering  has  been  examined  at  a  variety  of  scales.  Pore- 
scale  systems  are  required  when  considering  such  processes  as 
chemical  reaction  kinetics  and  the  diffusion  of  oxygen  into  the 
fuel surface [76] . Macroscopic systems, such as those deﬁned by 
a Representative Elementary Volume (REV) [77] , are valuable for 
considering bulk properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, bulk den- 
sity,  thermal  conductivity),  the  corresponding  ﬂux-gradient  rela- 
tionships (e.g., Darcy’s Law for ﬂuid ﬂow, Fourier’s Law for heat 
conduction), and the conservation of mass and energy model for- 
mulations that employ them [78 , 79] . Bed-scale systems are needed 
for smouldering propagation (average peak temperature, front ve- 
locity) and energy balance considerations [80 , 81] . Field-scale sys- 
tems are relevant for studying large engineering problems where 
the scale of the problem is larger than the scale of heterogene- 
ity of key properties, e.g., coal seam burning [29 , 30] , in situ com- 
bustion for oil recovery [31-39] , in situ and ex situ contaminated 
soil treatment [49 , 53] . This review does not aim to summarize all 
of this work. Rather, it tries to summarize key aspects that form 
a common theme and link the smouldering propagation process 
across these scales. 

Indeed, the chemical mechanisms referred to above are a local 
phenomenon. “Local” will be a key word used in this review to 
describe any process that can be considered at a small scale with 
respect to space (relative to the scale of the system) and occur- 
ring at a speciﬁc time. For example, processes happening within 
a thin reaction front are considered local, such as reaction rates, 
mass transfer, and heat exchange. However, the output of a smoul- 
dering system referred to above is a global phenomenon. “Global”
will  be  a  key  word  referring  to  processes  that  must  be  consid- 
ered as integrated over space (e.g., over the fuel bed/entire system) 
and/or over time. Examples of global phenomena include net en- 
ergy production, total fuel mass destruction, and cumulative gases

produced. Some processes can be considered either at the local or 
the global scale, such as heat transfer. One of the goals of this re- 
view is to clearly differentiate local from global smouldering be- 
haviour, so the key words will appear regularly to underscore this 
distinction. 

In  smouldering  combustion,  chemical  reactions  are  inextrica- 
bly  coupled  with  heat  and  mass  transfer  mechanisms.  Thermo- 
gravimetry (TG), Differential Thermogravimetry (DTG), and Differ- 
ential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) have been extensively employed 
to isolate the chemistry from the heat and mass transfer mecha- 
nisms. They provide an environment of controlled atmosphere and 
heating rate, with negligible thermal gradient and species trans- 
port. Moreover, only heterogeneous reactions are measured due to 
the short residence time of air in the sample [7] . The use of these 
techniques along with bench scale experiments have been central 
to deﬁning key processes, both local and global, related to smoul- 
dering. 

2.2. Process nomenclature 

Inconsistencies  in  terminology  and  confusion  in  the  concepts 
related to smouldering are common in the literature. This section 
attempts to establish a consistent nomenclature for key processes 
so as to provide a foundation for the rest of the paper. 

For  the  purposes  of  this  review,  seven  distinct  processes 
are  identiﬁed  related  to  smouldering:  inert  heating,  endother- 
mic pyrolysis, exothermic degradation, assisted thermal degradation, 
self-sustaining thermal degradation, self-sustaining smouldering, and 
smouldering  propagation .  In  smouldering,  spatial  distribution  of 
chemistry and temperature means that the relationship between 
chemistry  and  temperature  is  not  always  direct;  therefore,  it  is 
necessary to separate heat and mass transfer from chemistry. This 
is the main reason to deﬁne these seven processes. These processes 
will then be used, in combination with heat and mass transfer con- 
siderations, to describe different smouldering regimes. These pro- 
cesses should not be directly related to ignition, extinction or tran- 
sition to ﬂaming but purely relate (with the exception of smoulder- 
ing propagation ) to local thermochemistry. 

Note that the temperature ranges at which these processes oc- 
cur are variable, may overlap, and depend on fuel composition, at- 
mosphere, and heating rates [7 , 82] . Literature on solid and liquid 
fuels (when appropriate) will be used to deﬁne each of these pro- 
cesses. However, most of the examples will be taken from biomass 
decomposition literature, which provides substantial research rele- 
vant to smouldering combustion. 

If the heat provided either by an external source or by exother- 
mal processes is insuﬃcient to overcome the activation energy of 
the endothermic pyrolysis and oxidative reactions, these reactions 
will not occur. Under these conditions, temperature changes only 
relate  to  enthalpy  changes  and  mass  loss  is  associated  only  to 
phase change. Both processes are driven by thermodynamics. This 
process  is  herein  referred  to  as  inert  heating .  A  review  of  most 
of  the  relevant  literature  associated  to  inert  heating  is  provided 
by [83] and [84] together with experimental results that indicate 
that  the  evaporation  of  relatively  stable  high  molecular  weight 
species  occurs  below  220 °C,  generating  numerous  products.  De- 
composition of biomass containing compounds such as starch, cel- 
lulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin occurs mostly at tempera- 
tures higher than 220 °C. Oja et al. [83] and Schulten [84] provide 
a  detailed  analysis  of  these  products.  Further  analysis  is  beyond 
the scope of this study except, given their importance, it is worth 
brieﬂy discussing water, gl ycerol, and nicotine (typical of tobacco 
products, where extensive literature is available). 

Inert  heating  can  include  low  temperature  endothermic  pro- 
cesses such as the evaporation of water, nicotine, or glycerol. Fig. 1 
shows the comparative degradation of tobacco, glycerol, and a mix-

mixture heated at 35 °C min −1

permission of Elsevier). 

ture  of  tobacco  and  glycerol.  The  evaporation  of  water  appears 
as  an  endothermic  process  at  approximately  100 °C  for  tobacco 
and tobacco-glycerol mixtures. At temperatures between 120 and 
250 °C the endothermic evaporation of glycerol is observed for all 
three  materials  with  the  mixture  showing  an  endothermic  peak 
in  between  the  tobacco  and  the  pure  glycerol.  The  evaporation 
of nicotine is not obvious from the TGA/DSC curves, nevertheless, 
many studies have shown that the endothermic evaporation of dif- 
ferent forms of nicotine compounds occurs in a range of temper- 
atures between 110 °C and 220 °C [85] . Analysis of gas emissions 
show that these three compounds do not undergo any chemical 
transformation,  thus,  thermodynamics  controls  evaporation,  and 
mass  loss  occurs  purely  due  to  inert  heating.  Inert  heating  will 
produce emissions that will most likely recondense within the rel- 
atively cool porous medium ahead of the smouldering front un- 
less the processes are very close to the surface or the ﬂow drives 
them away from the porous medium. In experiments using reac- 
tors where the ﬂow drives emissions towards the porous medium, 
then these emissions will not appear until the front approaches the 
end of the reactor [50] . 

As the temperature increases beyond those of inert heating, but 
below oxidation temperatures, thermal degradation of the fuel –
i.e., the decomposition of the fuel into different, typically shorter- 
chain compounds – will occur. There is no evidence in the biomass 
literature that indicates that self-sustaining smouldering can occur 
as a single-step oxidation with no thermal degradation, neverthe- 
less, thermal degradation can occur without self-sustaining smoul- 
dering. Most solid (e.g., coal, oil shale) or liquid hydrocarbons (e.g., 
crude oil, bitumen, coal tar) can be endothermically degraded into 
heavy liquids (tar) and porous solids (char). Tar is any high molec- 
ular weight product that is volatile at these intermediate temper- 
atures but condenses near ambient temperatures. Char is a solid 
porous  material  with  large  surface-to-volume  ratio  and  variable 
structure, reactivity, and composition (containing not only carbon 
but varying amounts of C, H, N, and O). In liquid hydrocarbons, tars 
are described as a mixture of maltenes (liquid phase that is solu- 
ble in n-heptane) and asphaltenes (solid particles, insoluble in n- 
heptane, dispersed in the liquid phase) [87-98] . Maltene degrada- 
tion results in asphaltenes and asphaltene degradation yields char 
[89 , 92 , 97 , 99-104] . Different types  of  tar  and  char  (and fractions) 
can be produced from different types of fuels, atmosphere (inert 
or oxidative), and heating rates [7 , 82 , 105] . Ohlemiller and Rogers 
[82] describe different char vs tar formation paths for solid hydro- 
carbons. Foams, cellulosic materials, and many rigid polyurethanes 
typically form only a solid char in either oxidizing or inert atmo-

they produce CO or CO 
2 ). There is currently no evidence that the 
net energy resulting from exothermic degradation and endother- 
mic pyrolysis is capable of proceeding towards oxidation with no 
external  heat  supply  [7 , 117-120] .  This  separation  of  endothermic 
pyrolysis  and  exothermic  degradation  processes  is  necessary  be- 
cause self-sustained smouldering requires an energy balance that is 
positive enough to raise the temperature of the chars/tars formed 
to levels were oxidation can occur. 

At  this  stage  we  can  introduce  three  different  processes,  as- 
sisted thermal degradation, self-sustaining thermal degradation , and 
self-sustaining smouldering . These are local processes that describe 
three different possible outcomes of the local energy balance. This 
review will refer to the overall combination of exothermic degrada- 
tion and endothermic pyrolysis that leads to a negative energy re- 
lease as assisted thermal degradation . As an example, in Fig. 2 a, be- 
low 300 °C-350 °C, endothermic pyrolysis reactions dominate over 
exothermic degradation reactions requiring an external heat sup- 
ply to sustain the fuel degradation. It might be possible that, for 
certain fuels, exothermic degradation overwhelms the endothermic 
nature of pyrolysis and the result is an exothermic process that re- 
leases a surplus of heat ( Fig. 2 b). In that case, if this surplus of 
heat is less than the apparent activation energy of all combined 
degradation chemical reactions occurring near the released heat, 
the process remains as assisted thermal degradation . Whereas, if the 
net heat generated by the process surpasses the apparent activa- 
tion  energy  of  all  degradation  chemical  reactions  combined,  the 
degradation  process  has  the  potential  to  become  self-sustaining. 
This review will refer to this latter process as self-sustained thermal 
degradation . If the net energy production exceeds the energy re- 
quired to activate oxidative chemical reactions, then self-sustained 
smouldering can occur. 

It  is  important  not  to  confuse  self-sustained  smouldering  with 
the  self-sustained  propagation  of  a  smouldering  reaction,  herein 
referred to as smouldering propagation . Self-sustained smouldering 
is an intrinsic (i.e., local) chemical process that does not consider 
heat  and  mass  transfer  throughout  the  porous  fuel  bed.  Smoul- 
dering propagation is the result of complex heat and mass trans- 
fer  processes  (including  an  exchange  of  heat,  oxygen,  and  com- 
bustion  products)  that  allows  a  self-sustained  smouldering  reac- 
tion to propagate through a porous bed [7 , 64 , 107 , 110 , 119 , 122-130] . 
Thus, smouldering combustion is not local but global, in that it re- 
quires integration of processes in time and in space throughout the 
fuel bed. In biomass materials, heat losses are unavoidable and the 
transport of oxygen and gaseous reaction products is never ideal. 
Therefore, the conditions leading to smouldering propagation al- 
ways involve ineﬃciencies associated with heat and mass trans- 
fer that do not need to be considered when analysing the condi- 
tions leading to intrinsic self-sustained smouldering. Hence, while 
the  local  reaction  is  always  referred  to  as  self-sustained  smoul- 
dering, the global process of smouldering propagation can be self- 
sustained or non-self-sustained (further discussed in Section 4 ). 

2.3. Reaction zones 

Fig. 3 shows the TG-DTG-DSC curves associated with the ther- 
mal decomposition of Bright and Burley tobaccos [131] that serves 
to illustrate the different processes described above. More recent 
studies  report  similar  observations  [132-134] .  Zone  I  represents 
the inert heating zone where endothermic evaporation of volatile 
compounds occurs. Zone II represents the exothermic degradation 
while  Zone  III  and  Zone  IV  correspond  to  endothermic  pyroly- 
sis. Despite the minor differences, both tobaccos show exactly the 
same degradation sequence. In both cases moisture evaporation is 
not present (biomass was dried prior to the test). 

Fig.  4  compares  degradation  in  the  presence  of  oxygen  with 
degradation in a nitrogen atmosphere [132 , 133] . As soon as oxygen

spheres [16 , 106-112] . In contrast, ﬂexible urethane foams may form 
both tar and char in variable fractions [110-112] . 

Pyrolysis has been used in the literature as an all-encompassing 
term for the generation of thermal degradation by-products. As a 
result,  pyrolysis  has  been  used  to  deﬁne  both  endothermic  and 
exothermic processes, which can cause confusion. In this review, 
these subsets of thermal degradation are clearly distinguished: En- 
dothermic  degradation  processes  are  referred  to  as  endothermic 
pyrolysis while exothermic thermal degradation processes are re- 
ferred to as exothermic degradation. 

For  biomass  speciﬁcally,  Tumuluru  et  al.  [113]  provide  a  de- 
tailed review of low temperature biomass degradation as part of 
a discussion on torrefaction, i.e., thermal degradation typically be- 
tween 200 and 320 °C. Fig. 2 compares the degradation paths for 
hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and pectin (typical components of 
biomass). While the onset of degradation for cellulose occurs above 
300 °C, and this degradation corresponds to endothermic pyrolysis, 
hemicellulose and pectin undergo exothermic degradation between 
220 °C and 250 °C as does lignin, but as early as 150 °C. The compo- 
sition of the gas products of degradation below 300 °C is provided 
by [114] for different biomass products, showing the presence of 
CH 
2 . Typical mass loss in this stage can reach ap- 
proximately 10% of the biomass [115] . Yang et al. [116] attribute 
the  exothermic  degradation  of  hemicellulose  to  the  larger  pres- 
ence of organic compounds containing C–O, while the presence of 
methoxyl–O–CH 
3  with lignin might be responsible for these ear- 
lier degradation steps. Exothermic degradation reactions include de- 
polymerisation and the production of altered and rearranged poly- 
sugar structures but do not involve an external oxidizer (even if

[133]  presented  in  Fig.  4 .  Yang  et  al.  [116]  report  peaks  in  the 
same range for the exothermic degradation of hemicellulose and 
Einhorn-Stoll et al. [121] for pectin (see Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, in the 
presence of oxygen extrinsic to the fuel, the second and third peak 
result in exothermic reactions. The heat ﬂux ( Fig. 7 ) from these re- 
actions increases strongly with the heating rate showing that they 
are  weakly  exothermic.  However,  in  some  materials  such  as  hu- 
man faeces, animal faeces [137] , or biosolids [138] the exothermic 
degradation  is  strong  and  inherent  in  the  conversion  process  of 
such materials ( Fig. 8 ). 

It  is  likely  that  these  reactions  will  not  sustain  propagation 
through the biomass, nevertheless, it is not possible to establish 
this unless a detailed solution to the mass, momentum, and energy 
equations is obtained for the exact conﬁguration of the porous ma- 
trix. 

The strongest oxidative reaction appears between ∼434 °C and 
460 °C.  This  peak  is  consistent  between  the  results  reported  in

tion is what most studies in the literature often classify as the sec- 
ond step of a two-reaction model such as the one presented below. 
Many studies will refer to this step as “char oxidation”. The tem- 
peratures presented above are just indicators of the reaction, “char 
oxidation” can manifest itself during smouldering at much higher 
temperatures [38 , 40 , 45] .

is present Zone III separates from Zone IV showing the presence of 
a new and very signiﬁcant peak ( ∼ 480 °C) and a second minor 
peak ( ∼650 °C). These peaks correspond to self-sustained smoul- 
dering. Since smouldering propagation incorporates heat and mass 
transfer, it cannot be analysed using TGA. While it is clear that self- 
sustained  smouldering  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  smouldering 
propagation, these temperatures represent the lower limit where 
the chemistry is net exothermic. Thus, emissions from smouldering 
propagation can be traced ultimately back to these temperatures. 
There is no need for higher temperature chemistry for smoulder- 
ing propagation to exist. 

In many forms of biomass, the rate of mass loss shows three 
major  peaks  ( Figs.  5  and  6 )  under  N 
2  and  four  peaks  under 
air [134-136] . The two low temperature major degradation steps 
(115 °C  and  250 °C)  correspond  to  the  inert  heating  zone  (water 
and glycerol evaporation), as shown in Fig. 1 . The third step corre- 
sponds to assisted thermal degradation as illustrated in Figs. 1 to 4 . 
Under air, the fourth step corresponds to the self-sustained smoul- 
dering (oxidation) step. 

The heat ﬂow curve ( Fig. 7 ) shows two visible peaks under N 
2 
with  the  common  lags  of  a  few  degrees  typical  of  high  heating 
rates and/or large particle size. In the absence of a well character- 
ized baseline, it is not possible to establish if any of the individual 
peaks might be endo- or exothermic. However, comparison with 
Figs. 1 and 2 allows inferring that the lower peaks might corre- 
spond to products such as nicotine evaporation [85] and that the 
higher peaks could correspond to exothermic degradation of hemi- 
cellulose and lignin or endothermic pyrolysis of cellulose [116] . 

The studies by Barontini et al. [134] and Park [135] show that 
in  the  presence  of  oxygen  a  fourth  peak  above  400 °C  appears. 
This is the clearest difference between the mass loss rate traces 
in nitrogen and air presented in Figs. 6 and 7 . The behaviour be- 
low  400 °C  seems  to  remain  unaffected  by  the  presence  of  oxy- 
gen.  These  observations  are  consistent  with  those  of  [132]  and

The ﬁrst step will encompass, within a global heat of pyroly- 
sis ( (cid:3)H pyr ), the endothermicity associated to inert heating and as- 
sisted thermal degradation. Meanwhile the second term will incor- 
porate, within a global heat of combustion ( (cid:3)H 
oxid ), all exothermic 
terms  associated  with  self-sustained  smouldering.  As  described 
before,  biomass  does  not  necessarily  ﬁt  this  simple  formulation 
in  that  all  endothermicity  ( (cid:3)H pyr )  seems  to  occur  below  200 °C 
and that assisted thermal degradation also incorporates exothermic 
steps ( Figs. 1 to 4 ). 

It  is  currently  not  clear  the  necessary  number  of  steps  re- 
quired  to  model  smouldering  propagation  and  how  this  is  af- 
fected by the fuel type and environmental conditions (further dis- 
cussed in Section 2.4 ). Reduction of steps seems to be only possible 
when heat and mass transfer enables spatially resolving inert heat- 
ing and assisted thermal degradation together ahead of a highly 
exothermic front. Nevertheless, other factors such as oxygen con- 
centration in the gas phase or compounds intrinsic to the fuel can 
drive these decomposition steps, thereby complicating the step re- 
duction process. It is important to note that the literature does not 
provide any fundamental method to deliver a reduced chemical ki- 
netic model for smouldering. The combination of Kissinger and Ge- 
netic Algorithms was ﬁrst suggested by Rein et al. [108] to extract 
kinetic  parameters  from  best  ﬁts  to  TGA  data  (further  discussed 
in Section 2.4 ). These mathematical ﬁts, in combination with pre- 
viously proposed reduced reaction models [7 , 117 , 139] , helped de- 
liver adequate predictions of smouldering temperatures and prop- 
agation rates as well as to infer chemical explanations for observa- 
tions, such as the enhancement of the rate of decomposition that 
occurs when oxygen is present in the gas phase [106] . While there 
is value to this approach, it is clear that, as a mathematical ﬁt to 
highly  non-linear  equations,  it  is  not  always  a  reliable  approach 
to justify when multiple steps are necessary to fully describe the 
degradation of a material [140] .

occurring  at  temperatures  lower  than  the  highest  temperature

2 ( Fig. 9 ). The production of CO 

peak ( ∼434 °C and 460 °C), it is necessary to look at the production 
of CO and CO 
2 in nitrogen covers 
the entire temperature range above 100 °C while the production of 
CO only begins above 225 °C. The same trend can be observed for 
the production of CO and CO 
2  in air, where the main difference 
is the magnitude of the peaks and the presence of a new peak at 
∼425 °C.  As  mentioned  above,  several  reactions  in  the  thermally 
2  [113- 
assisted regime can lead to the production of CO and CO 
116] , nevertheless, above 280 °C-290 °C ( Fig. 4 ) the presence of ex- 
trinsic oxygen starts having a signiﬁcant effect on the degradation 
process. 

The CO/CO 

2 ratio is commonly used as a signature of the pres- 
ence of oxidation reactions and in particular smouldering (whether 
self-sustained smouldering or smouldering propagation) seems to 
deliver  well-deﬁned  CO/CO 
2  ratios  for  solid  fuels  [18] .  For  the 
∼130 °C peak the ratio is zero, and therefore it can be assumed 
with certainty that CO 
2 emerges from the assisted thermal degra- 
dation of the biomass but is not the product of oxidative reactions. 
The second peak appears at ∼325 °C, for this peak the CO/CO 
2 ratio 
is approximately 0.25 for both air and nitrogen. The production of 
2 increases in magnitude with a larger supply of oxygen 
CO and CO 
but the CO/CO 
2 ratio remains approximately constant. This shows 
that this reaction is oxygen limited but it is the same reaction for 
nitrogen and air. This peak could potentially be associated to tran- 
sitions from the decomposition of hemicellulose (lower tempera- 
ture) to that of lignin and cellulose (higher temperature) ( Fig. 2 
and [113] ). Nevertheless, it is not possible to discard the presence 
of smouldering reactions. For the ﬁnal peak ( ∼425 °C), the CO/CO 
2 

ratio is 0.05. After all the lignocellulosic biomass (hemicellulose, 
cellulose, and lignin) has been thermally degraded to char, thereby 
increasing the biomass’ surface to volume ratio, the surrounding 
2  attacks the highly exposed surface of the remaining char and 
O 
promotes complete combustion, resulting in a lower CO/CO 
2 ratio. 
Despite being lower, these ratios are still within typical ranges for 
smouldering combustion. For smouldering of organic material em- 
2 values can be variable 
bedded within an inert sand matrix, CO/CO 
depending on fuel type and system conditions, ranging from 0.05 
to 0.40, with lower values favoured by higher air ﬂow rates and 
larger scales; a value of 0.20 at the laboratory scale for smoulder- 
ing faeces-in-sand [62] is an example. 

2.4. Chemistry 

A  research  topic  that  has  received  great  attention  in 
the  context  of  smouldering  is  the  deﬁnition  of  the  ki- 
netic  mechanisms  that  describe  the  main  chemical  reactions 
[7 , 76 , 106 , 107 , 109 , 110 , 130 , 141 , 142] . These kinetic mechanisms gen- 
erally describe competing exothermic and endothermic reactions, 
which combined, can result in net consumption or generation of 
heat. They can also aim to describe the production and consump- 
tion of key by-products. In virtually all instances, they represent a 
simpliﬁcation of the true (complex) chemical systems. Ideally, they 
provide information on the main reactions dominating the smoul- 
dering  system  at  various  temperatures  and  locations  within  the 
preheating and reaction zones (see Section 4 General Conceptual 
Model of Smouldering).

generated  from  non-smouldering  data  purely  as  an  optimization 
exercise [110] , it remains an open question the degree to which 
they  accurately  represent  smouldering  phenomena  (further  dis- 
cussed below). 

There are many chemical reactions that can occur within pyrol- 
ysis, assisted, or self-sustained thermal degradation of fuels [113] . 
Oxidative reactions tend to be much faster than pyrolysis reactions, 
so strong simpliﬁcations are possible and the literature provides ki- 
netic models of different levels of complexity [16 , 106-109] . These 
models range from simple one-step (global) reactions to complex 
systems with multiple steps. Table 1 provides a compilation of ki- 
netic  mechanisms  from  one  to  nine  steps  for  a  variety  of  solid 
and liquid hydrocarbons (peat, polyurethane foam, biomass, cellu- 
lose, cardboard, wood, tire waste, crude oil, heavy oil, bitumen, tar 
sands, oil shale, and asphalt). The aim of Table 1 is to show groups 
of generic kinetic mechanisms, thereby providing a synthesis of the 
disparate studies in the literature. 

The  majority  of  the  mechanisms  presented  in  Table  1  were 
proposed  based  on  the  seven  main  smouldering  processes  (see 
Section 2.2 Nomenclature) and using TG, DTG, and DSC data (un- 
der  air,  N 
2  atmospheres,  heating  rates  from  1  to  80 °C 
min −1 , and sample masses between 2 and 50 mg [89 , 90 , 96 , 97 , 100-

the dotted lines represent rod samples. Lines with downward peaks correspond to 
the weight loss rate and the decaying lines to the residual weight (reprinted from

The interest in smouldering chemistry stems from the oppor- 
tunities presented by the capability of numerical models to repro- 
duce the temporal and spatial evolution of smouldering propaga- 
tion [76 , 110] that was evidenced experimentally with polyurethane 
foams [143 , 144] . However, and as explained above, since they are

Highlights 
Widely used kinetic mechanis due to its 
simplicity. It is mostly employed in 
analytical smouldering models. Kinetic 
parameters are typically estimated 
through analytical methods. As pyrolysis 
reactions are not included, adjustment 
of the heat of oxidation is necessary to 
avoid extremely high temperatures. 
Fuel pyrolysis is included in Eq. (4) and 
(5). Eq. (4) implies that char oxidation 
can be neglected and Eq. (5) indicates 
that fuel oxidation is not relevant. For 
oil shale and any other material with 
inorganic content, an endothermic 
decarbonation (carbonates 
decomposition) can be introduced, Eq. 
(6). Eq. (7) neglects pyrolysis reactions 
and takes into account fuel and char 
oxidation. 

Competition between fuel pyrolysis and 
fuel oxidation is introduced in Eq. (8), 
whereas in Eq. (9) drying is included 
neglecting fuel oxidation. Although 
drying is a phase-change process, it is 
typically assumed as an Arrhenius-type 
reaction in TG analysis. However, when 
applied into smouldering simulations, it 
fails to properly simulate the heat and 
mass transfer aspects of drying below 
boiling temperatures [107] . 

Three oxidation reactions are introduced 
in Eq. (10): fuel (heavy oil), tar (light 
oil), and char (coke) oxidations. Eq. (11) 
shows that oil shale undergoes drying, 
fuel pyrolysis yielding tar (mixture of 
oily hydrocarbons) and char (ﬁxed 
carbon). Char is oxidized and an 
endothermic decarbonation takes place. 
Both mechanisms were reformulated in 
terms of generic terms.

ics, Resins, and Asphaltenes [91 , 95 , 176] ) analysis (i.e., a technique 
that separates liquid compounds into fractions according to their 
solubility in solvents of different polarity). Examples of TG, DTG, 
and DSC data are provided in Sections 2.1 - 2.3 . Most of the cited 
studies had the end goal of simply ﬁtting kinetic reaction param- 
eters against TG/DTG data without applying them to smouldering 
numerical models [103] . 

A  one-step  oxidation  reaction  mechanism  (Eq.  3)  is  widely 
used  in  the  forward  and  opposed  smouldering  literature 
[64 , 122 , 123 , 125-130 , 145-149]  due  to  its  simplicity.  Such  global 
reactions  blend  endothermic  pyrolysis,  exothermic  degradation, 
and  oxidation  components  [122 , 123] .  One-step  mechanisms  are 
popular in analytical smouldering models [64 , 122 , 123 , 125 , 146-149] 
and  in  models  that  investigate  factors  affecting  self-sustaining 
smouldering behaviour without directly considering the effect of 
pyrolysis  [145] .  The  absence  of  pyrolysis  reactions  in  analytical 
models  is  understandable  since  more  reactions  introduce  more 

non-linearities  into  the  governing  equations.  Numerical  models 
usually neglect pyrolysis reactions based on the assumption that 
the  heat  of  pyrolysis  ( (cid:3)H pyr )  is  relatively  small  when  compared 
with  the  heat  of  oxidation  ( (cid:3)H 
oxid )  [7 , 64 , 118 , 119 , 122 , 123 , 125- 
130 , 145-150]  thus  treating  its  endothermicity  as  a  correction  to 
the energy released by oxidation can be deemed appropriate. Un- 
der robust smouldering conditions this is usually a valid approach 
(e.g., [80 , 81] ). However, it is known that pyrolysis is an important 
energy  sink  since,  near  extinction,  oxidation  reactions  decrease 
to  such  an  extent  that  pyrolysis  may  no  longer  be  a  negligible 
component  of  the  energy  balance  [7 , 76 , 108 , 124 , 151 , 155 , 177] .  In 
addition, the understanding of pyrolysis has been considered nec- 
essary  to  simulate  smouldering  ignition  [76 , 105 , 106 , 151 , 177-179] . 
Smouldering models that neglect pyrolysis and heat losses tend to 
show peak temperatures that increase excessively due to the large 
(cid:3)H 
oxid .  Thus,  such  one-step  oxidation  models  [64 , 122 , 123 , 125- 
130 , 145-149] may need to adjust the (cid:3)H 
oxid heuristically to avoid 
unrealistically high temperatures.

Two-step  mechanisms  are  presented  in  Eqs.  (4–7).  Eq.  (4) 
shows  a  simpliﬁed  mechanism  for  opposed  smouldering,  where 
fuel is endothermically pyrolyzed and exothermically oxidized at 
the  same  time.  In  opposed  smouldering,  char  oxidation  is  con- 
sidered  negligible  due  to  its  slow  kinetics  [180]  (note  that  in 
opposed  smouldering  heat  transfer  is  toward  the  burnt  region, 
Fig. 19 b), and all of the energy released comes from fuel oxidation 
[7 , 118 , 124 , 151 , 153] .  In  this  conﬁguration,  oxygen  will  be  mostly 
consumed at the smouldering front leaving the char in an oxygen 
deﬁcient environment. This prevents char oxidation. This mecha- 
nism adds pyrolysis only as a heat sink. 

Moussa et al. [117] also proposed a two-step mechanism (Eq. 
5)  for  cellulosic  materials.  First,  fuel  is  pyrolyzed,  creating  char, 
which is subsequently oxidized. This mechanism is mostly used in 
forward smouldering because heat is transferred towards the vir- 
gin fuel ahead of the smouldering front (which consumes the oxy- 
gen) and the oxygen deﬁcient region favours pyrolysis. The two- 
step  mechanism  does  not  take  into  account  fuel  oxidation  (due 
to  its  negligible  energy  released  [152] ).  Recently,  Zanoni  et  al. 
[152] conﬁrmed that the same two-step mechanism (Eq. (5)) was 
able to simulate self-sustaining forward smouldering and smoul- 
dering propagation for bitumen embedded in a sand matrix. The 
main energy release was attributed to char oxidation [80] . 

The  literature  shows  the  addition  or  elimination  of  steps  for 
speciﬁc fuels. For example, in Eq. (6) (e.g., oil shale smouldering 
[150] ), a new heat sink was introduced: the endothermic decom- 
position of carbonates, which is different from endothermic pyrol- 
ysis. In Eq. (7) pyrolysis is deemed negligible and the process is 
governed by two exothermic reactions from fuel and char oxida- 
tion [118] . 

Observing  two  exothermic  peaks  in  DSC  experiments  for 
polyurethane  foams,  Ohlemiller  [7]  ﬁrst  proposed  a  three-step 
mechanism (Eq. (8)), which was an improvement of Eq. (5), deﬁn- 
ing  smouldering  as  a  competition  between  endothermic  pyrol- 
ysis  and  exothermic  degradation  (ﬁrst  exothermic  peak).  Both 
reactions  form  char,  which  is  completely  or  partially  oxidized 
(second exothermic peak), resulting in self-sustained smouldering 
[7 , 99 , 103 , 110 , 112 , 118 , 124 , 141 , 142 , 151 , 170 , 176 , 181 , 182] . 

Rein et al. [110] proposed and optimized more complex kinetic 
mechanisms for polyurethane foam. Based on TG experiments, they 
concluded  that  a  ﬁve-step  mechanism  (Eq.  (12))  was  more  ap- 
propriate  to  phenomenologically  predict  the  experimental  obser- 
vations of the species distributions in both opposed and forward 
smouldering. This was determined after Rein et al. [157] , where a 
three-step mechanism (Eq. 8)) for foam was tested in a smoulder- 
ing model and under-predicted char production. The model limita- 
tions were attributed to the application of only one pyrolysis reac- 
tion. 

Research on smouldering of wet fuels (e.g., biomass, peat) intro- 
duced water evaporation (Eqs. (7, 9, 11, and 16), typically treated as 
a chemical reaction [106-108 , 159 , 163] rather than a phase-change 
process (a part of inert heating). Thus, most of the kinetic mecha- 
nisms including water evaporation, when applied into smouldering 
combustion models, are not able to capture the physical charac- 
teristics of drying, such as the boiling temperature plateau around 
100 °C.  Moreover,  they  would  not  be  able  to  consider  the  effect 
of  water  on  the  energy  balance  (i.e.,  as  described  in  Section  4 ). 
It is important to note that some fuels (e.g., peat) have a signif- 
icant fraction of water and its movement by evaporation and re- 
condensation can alter the energy balance in the ignition, prop- 
agation, and extinction of the smouldering front [7 , 108 , 183] (see 
Section 3 for further discussion). 

Complex kinetic mechanisms with seven (Eq. 16), eight (Eq. 17) 
reactions  were  used  with  the  intention  of  predicting  the  transi- 
tion  to  ﬂaming  [155 , 160 , 161] .  More  reactions  have  the  tendency 
of ﬁtting TG data with more precision. However, when employed 

in smouldering combustion models, these extra reactions generally 
produce negligible effects on  the predicted smouldering process. 
For example, Rein et al. [110] concluded that the oxidation of the 
virgin foam in forward smouldering may be neglected since nearly 
all the fuel was converted to β-foam. In addition, β-foam was con- 
sumed by oxidation instead of its competing pyrolysis reaction. An- 
other example can be found in [160] , in which the model was very 
sensitive to the ﬁrst char oxidation but not sensitive to the ﬁnal 
step of pyrolysis and ﬁnal char oxidation. 

The  mechanisms  presented  in  Table  1  were  developed  based 
on experimental observations of TG/DTG data and accepted math- 
ematical  formulations  for  the  decomposition  chemistry.  These 
mathematical formulations are necessary to incorporate the chem- 
ical reaction into smouldering propagation models. Chemistry the- 
ory describes such mechanisms in terms of reaction rates ( ˙ R ): 
(cid:2)

[ Y O 2 ] m 

(19) 

where n and m are the reaction orders, Y F and Y 
O2 are the mass 
fractions  of  fuel  and  oxygen,  respectively.  Z  is  the  temperature- 
dependant component of the reaction rate and it is generally de- 
scribed by the Arrhenius equation: 
(cid:5)

(cid:4)

Z = Aexp 

− E

(20) 

where A is the pre-exponential factor, E is the activation energy, 
R g  is  the  ideal  gas  constant,  and  T  is  the  temperature.  Pyrolysis 
reaction rates are represented by Eq. (19) with Y O2 = 0. 

The application of such kinetic mechanisms in smouldering nu- 
merical models requires the estimation of the kinetic parameters, 
i.e., activation energy ( E ), pre-exponential factor ( A ), and reaction 
orders ( n,m ), as described in the Arrhenius equation. These expres- 
sions are continuous functions, therefore a unique temperature for 
the onset of these reactions is diﬃcult to establish. Characteristic 
temperatures obtained from TG/DTG/DSC data are generally used 
to describe the temperature at which each process occurs. Never- 
theless, these temperatures depend on the heating rates and sam- 
ple sizes used. 

Several  methods  may  be  used  to  calculate/estimate  the  Ar- 
rhenius  parameters  from  TG/DTG/DSC  data:  Kissinger,  Ozawa, 
(GA), 
Freeman-Carroll,  Coats-Redfern,  Genetic  Algorithms 
Levenberg-Marquart  (LM)  algorithm,  etc.  105 , [106 , 110 , 159 , 162- 
165 , 184-192] . Limitations can be found in all of them. For exam- 
ple,  graphical  methods  (e.g.,  Kissinger,  Ozawa)  are  only  suitable 
for  reactions  that  are  simple,  non-noisy,  and  non-overlapping. 
LM  algorithms  converge  quickly  but  are  sensitive  to  the  initial 
guess.  GA  can  be  used  for  a  large  number  of  unknown  kinetic 
parameters;  however,  it  is  time  consuming  and  stochastic,  i.e., 
the solution uniqueness is not guaranteed [105 , 110 , 159 , 184] . It is 
important to further discuss the methodologies used to obtain the 
kinetic parameters because the applicability of these values to the 
modelling of smouldering propagation is intimately related to the 
way in which they were obtained. 

Figs. 10 and 11 show an example of the kinetic parameter cal- 
culation for the pyrolysis of cellulosic paper [193] via the Kissinger 
method [185] . Note that, although pyrolysis is shown as an exam- 
ple, kinetic parameters for oxidation reactions can also be calcu- 
lated via the Kissinger method [185] . Fig. 10 describes one main 
peak in the DTG. Therefore, a one-step pyrolysis mechanism simi- 
lar to the ﬁrst reaction of Eq. (4) ( Table 1 ) was used. The Kissinger 
method is presented in Fig. 11 , where ln ( ( d T /d t ) /T 2 
max ) is plotted 
against 10 0 0/ T max . Here, dT / dt is the heating rate and T max  is the 
corresponding temperature at the DTG peak. The slope of the lin- 
ear regression is E / R g , where R g is the ideal gas constant, and the 
intercept is ln ( AR g / E ). Therefore, E and A were calculated from Fig. 
11 as 220 kJ mol −1 and 1.2 × 10 19 min −1 , respectively. In cases with

use a small particle ( μm scale) of fuel and thus are not able to 
incorporate the role of an inert matrix; therefore, potentially im- 
portant heat and mass transfer and surface area effects on the re- 
actions may be neglected [7] . Third, the compensation effect (i.e., 
any variation in the activation energy ( E ) will cause also a change 
in the pre-exponential factor ( A ), which partially compensates for 
the effect of the activation energy change) may occur since ln ( A ) 
has a linear relationship with E [195] ; this is especially relevant to 
complex mechanisms, in which several reactions may have simi- 
lar decomposition temperature intervals. The compensation effect 
may arise as a result of either the inﬂuence of experimental fac- 
tors (e.g., heating rates) or the mathematical nature of the Arrhe- 
nius equation [105 , 110 , 129 , 141 , 150 , 196-199] . Fourth, some studies 
[76 , 151] have suggested that kinetic parameters associated with a 
speciﬁc reaction mechanism might have no fundamental physical 
meaning and, even if carefully estimated, they may have to be sig- 
niﬁcantly changed to produce the best possible description of real- 
ity. 

Clearly,  chemical  mechanisms  and  kinetic  parameters  depend 
on  the  type  of  fuel,  TG/DTG/DSC  heating  rates,  chosen  kinetic 
mechanism complexity, and methods of estimation. The appropri- 
ateness of the ﬁnal chemical scheme must be considered carefully 
in the context of the intended application. It is not expected that 
the same set of kinetic parameters will be appropriate to describe 
different scenarios: ( i ) TG/DTG data, ( ii ) TG/DTG/DSC data, ( iii ) an- 
alytical descriptions of self-sustaining smouldering, ( iv ) smoulder- 
ing propagation under robust conditions, ( v ) smouldering propa- 
gation under non-robust conditions, ( vi ) smouldering propagation 
of wet fuels, ( vii ) the global energy balance in a smouldering sys- 
tem, and ( viii ) the emissions/by-products resulting from smoulder- 
ing  propagation  (see  Section  5  Emissions),  to  name  only  a  few 
scenarios. It is an open question as to the appropriateness of the 
existing schemes for many of these uses and the degree of sim- 
pliﬁcation  that  can  be  employed  while  still  producing  meaning- 
ful  predictions.  Currently,  this  question  cannot  be  addressed  be- 
cause mass transfer effects between the different phases has not 
been studied  in  detail. The  reaction  rates  depend on  the  supply 
of reactants to the reaction zone ( Eq. (19) ) and the reaction oc- 
curs in the solid phase, therefore, without detailed quantiﬁcation 
of  mass  transfer  between  phases  it  is  not  possible  to  ascertain 
if  the  mathematical  expression  and  embedded  parameters  prop- 
erly quantify the reaction rates. This is a matter that needs further 
study.

more complex chemistry, such as in polyurethane foams, numer- 
ous chemical reactions can take place, some competing with oth- 
ers. Therefore, analytical methods cannot be employed and more 
robust techniques, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), are valuable 
to determine a set of kinetic parameters. Fig. 12 and Table 2 show 
an example of the estimation of kinetic and stoichiometric param- 
eters for polyurethane foam via GA [110] . The optimization process 
used the 5-step mechanism shown in Eq. (12), Table 1 . Twenty pa- 
rameters (log 
10 ( A ), E, n , and v ) were optimized at the same time 
( Table 2 ) by minimizing the difference between experimental data 
(mass loss ( Y ) and mass loss rate ( ˙ Y )) and numerical results:

where the constant γ represents the relative inﬂuence of Y over

optimization approaches can be found in [110] .

Although the literature on kinetic parameters estimation is ex- 
tensive,  there  are  reasons  to  be  cautious  in  applying  them  to 
smouldering systems. First, TG/DTG/DSC experiments use low and 
constant heating rates ([O(10 0–10 1 °C min −1 )]), whereas smoulder- 
ing typically occurs at higher and viariable heating rates ([O(10 1 –
10 3 °C min −1 )]) [106] . Such low heating rates favour some minor, 
low temperature reactions that often lose relevance at high heat- 
ing rates, thereby causing some discrepancy in the calculation of 
the Arrhenius parameters [152] . Second, TG/DTG/DSC experiments

Biomass is a fuel that has received extensive attention in the 
last few years. The focus has been to improve the numerical model 
ﬁrst proposed by Leach et al. [122] and apply it to biomass with 
signiﬁcant moisture content and susceptible to smouldering such 
as peat. While numerous studies and conﬁgurations have been ex- 
plored (e.g., [108 , 109 , 111 , 156 , 200 , 201] ) and compared to different 
experimental results (e.g., [202-204] ), the basis for the numerical 
scheme, the methodologies for the extraction of chemical kinetic 
parameters, the numerical treatment of moisture evaporation, and 
the reaction mechanisms are fundamentally the same. The general 
conclusion  of  these  studies  is  that  the  most  appropriate  kinetic 
scheme to reproduce the experimental results depends on the spe- 
ciﬁc conﬁguration and the characteristics of the fuel. It is impor- 
tant to note that, in these models, the numerical scheme used to 
describe smouldering includes numerous parameters that do not 
allow one to fully separate the role of chemistry from that of heat 
and mass transport. 

3. Ignition, extinction, and transition to ﬂaming 

3.1. Ignition 

Ignition of a porous solid fuel is a problem that has been of 
interest  for  the  last  century  and  is  deeply  embedded  in  general 

combustion ignition theories. The ﬁrst studies of combustion ig- 
nition were undertaken to understand coal mine explosions [205- 
208] . While theoretical and numerical formulations of combustion 
ignition have proposed criteria for ignition and detailed combus- 
tion ignition measurements have delivered insight into the under- 
lying physical processes applicable to smouldering, there are still 
many unanswered questions concerning ignition. 

Ignition of a smouldering reaction follows the same fundamen- 
tal principles as solid ignition, thus can potentially be described by 
the same methods. However, smouldering ignition is complicated 
by the intricacies of heat and mass transfer. Since smouldering is 
a heterogeneous reaction, diffusion of oxygen through the fuel sur- 
face deﬁnes the supply of oxidizer and the release of energy. Char- 
acteristic time scales for diffusion tend to be longer than those as- 
sociated to convection and radiation and therefore heat losses are 
of greater signiﬁcance. Smouldering is therefore commonly found 
only within porous media where heat transfer away from the re- 
action is limited by Darcy’s law [77] while oxygen diffusion is still 
enabled by the presence of oxygen in the pores. 

This section will present classic porous solid fuels ignition the- 
ory to provide insights into the ignition process and to establish 
its  limitations  when  addressing  smouldering.  A  numerical  anal- 
ysis that introduces transport processes then provides additional 
parameters controlling ignition of a smouldering reaction. Subse-

quently, Section 4.7 will provide a complementary understanding 
of ignition in the context of local and global energy balances. 

3.1.1. Fundamental principles of ignition 

Homogeneous ignition of a non-premixed ﬂame is attained by 
heating the solid until it undergoes pyrolysis [209] . The released 
volatiles will combine with oxygen and, as the temperature con- 
tinues to increase, a series of chemical reactions will occur leading 
to the net release of energy [210] . In contrast, heterogeneous igni- 
tion involves a solid exposed to oxygen that undergoes oxidation 
if the oxygen diffuses through its surface faster than the rate at 
which heating can induce pyrolysis [211-213] . The heat released by 
the heterogeneous reaction can continue to support the oxidation 
of the solid or can induce pyrolysis at a suﬃcient rate that the re- 
leased volatiles can lead to a homogeneous reaction (i.e., transition 
to ﬂaming) [207] . 

Since smouldering combustion is a heterogeneous reaction, ig- 
nition will follow the same processes as for heterogeneous com- 
bustion of any solid; nevertheless, transport processes tend to be 
complicated by the fact that the fuel is a porous medium. Further- 
more,  the  transition  from  heterogeneous  to  homogeneous  com- 
bustion  (i.e.,  transition  to  ﬂaming)  is  not  only  a  function  of  the 
characteristics  of  the  solid  fuel  and  the  heating  rates  but  it  is 
also strongly dependant on the transport mechanisms within the 
porous medium. The analysis of smouldering as a ﬁre safety prob- 
lem has searched for simple criteria that deﬁne whether ignition 
or transition to ﬂaming will occur. Ignition and transition to ﬂam- 
ing have thus been treated as secondary objectives in smouldering 
research with the characterization of the reaction’s propagation be- 
ing the primary focus. When smouldering is used as a controlled 
process [47 , 58 , 214] then the understanding of ignition and transi- 
tion to ﬂaming becomes a primary objective. 

There are not many experimental studies on smouldering igni- 
tion, and without exception they are phenomenological in nature. 
Ohlemiller [215] examined the effect of igniter geometry on smoul- 
der ignition of cellulose. Kitano and Nagano [216] , Anthenien and 
Fernandez-Pello [217] and Anderson et al. [218] have studied en- 
ergetic requirements to initiate a self-sustaining smoulder reaction 
under natural and forced convection ﬂow conditions. These studies 
examine the parameters and factors that control smouldering igni- 
tion and propagation. All of these studies stem from experimental 
observations and therefore are limited by the speciﬁcities of the fu- 
els used and the conditions of the studies. Nevertheless, they pro- 
vide insights into the various relevant processes. The main conclu- 
sion stemming from these studies is that smouldering ignition is a 
consequence of a very ﬁne balance between heat supply and heat 
losses to and from the reactive front and the heat generated by the 
reaction. While this is no different from any ignition event, what 
differentiates smouldering is the effect of the porous medium on 
the energy balance and the conditions leading to a heterogeneous 
or a homogeneous reaction. 

Both Anderson et al. [218] and Anthenien and Fernandez-Pello 
[217]  identiﬁed  critical  values  of  external  heat  input  that  re- 
sulted in ﬂaming combustion. Nevertheless, the role of the porous 
medium was only described in a qualitative manner. Torero and 
Fernandez-Pello [143 , 219] and Torero et al. [144 , 220] showed that 
a smouldering reaction will only propagate in polyurethane foam if 
the reaction was deep in the porous medium. This was explained 
by the insulating nature of the char minimizing heat losses. In the 
case  of  peat,  similar  experiments  were  conducted,  showing  that 
the  thickness  of  the  necessary  insulating  layer  decreased  as  the 
oxygen  concentration  (and  subsequent  char  oxidation)  increased 
[142] . For high oxygen concentrations (above ambient) almost no 
insulating layer was necessary and smouldering behaves almost as 
a surface process propagating into the porous medium, leaving be- 
hind almost no char. Similar observations have been reported by 

others 180 , [218 , 221 , 222] . Bar-Ilan et al. [223] explored the role of 
edge heat losses in a one-dimensional smouldering reaction. The 
authors introduced a simple heat loss term to quantify the bound- 
ary condition and attributed to these losses the need for a mini- 
mum size for the porous medium that will sustain smouldering. 

In summary, experimental studies indicate that smouldering ig- 
nition  can  be  described  in  a  similar  manner  to  any  other  igni- 
tion event. As opposed to homogeneous ignition, there is an up- 
per bound to heterogeneous ignition, where excessive heat supply 
favours pyrolysis and therefore leads to ﬂaming ignition. The heat 
released by smouldering reactions is relatively small, therefore it is 
necessary to consider the impact of the porous medium’s charac- 
teristics as well as its size and boundary heat losses. 

Theoretical studies of ignition are more extensive and are gen- 
erally based on the framework proposed by Semenov [224] . This 
is  consistent  with  the  experimental  observations  above  but  it  is 
limited  by  its  simplicity. While  the  principles of  Semenov’s  the- 
ory are applicable, their use in smouldering ignition is limited be- 
cause most materials susceptible to smouldering will degrade fol- 
lowing complex chemical pathways. Therefore, it is not possible to 
obtain an unique rate of heat release as used in Semenov’s theory 
[210 , 213 , 224 , 225] . Furthermore, transport of energy and species are 
usually the dominant factors deﬁning the conditions for ignition. 
The literature lists a number of parameters generally involved in 
the theoretical characterization of smouldering ignition. These pa- 
rameters are presented in Table 3 and represent all main forms of 
transport as well as the reaction kinetics. 

Simple  criteria  based  on  an  energy  balance  and  small  values 
of  Biot  number,  Bi → 0  (see  deﬁnition  of  Biot  number  and  sev- 
eral other dimensionless parameters in Table 3 ), prove to be in- 
suﬃcient. The result is that many authors have reported a range 
of conditions under which ignition can occur that are outside the 
bounds of Semenov’s deﬁnition [207 , 211 , 212 , 224 , 225] . 

The modiﬁed formulation proposed by Frank-Kamenetskii [232] , 
which allows for a high Bi, is potentially more appropriate for the 
analysis of smouldering ignition. Nevertheless, the formulation by 
Frank-Kamenetskii is also limited in that: ( i ) it proposes a purely 
thermal  analysis  that  ignores  mass  transfer  limitations,  and  ( ii ) 
heat losses from the ignition region normally only include conduc- 
tion  through  the  porous  medium.  Therefore,  convection  through 
the  porous  medium  and  local  thermal  non-equilibrium  between 
solid  and  gas  phases  cannot  be  resolved  by  Frank-Kamenetskii’s 
formulation.  Furthermore,  the  temperature  at  the  surface  of  the 
porous  medium  and  the  ambient  atmosphere  have  to  be  equal, 
which tends to only be the case for Bi > 10. For smouldering, these 
assumptions are not generally valid. Thomas [233] introduced in- 
termediate Biot numbers to account for a different boundary con- 
dition. Thomas added a simple but more realistic physical treat- 
ment, which considers conduction through the solid and convec- 
tive  heat  loss  from  the  surface,  i.e.,  a  Robin  boundary  condition 
type [234 , 235] . This approach adds some relevant physics, never- 
theless, it does not fully address the complexity of heat and mass 
transfer associated to smouldering. 

The objective of all these analyses was to extract a critical pa- 
rameter for ignition. Table 4 summarizes the different critical pa- 
rameters developed in the literature. As can be seen from the ta- 
ble, the critical parameter for ignition can be expressed in various 
ways (i.e., the critical rate of heat generation, critical environmen- 
tal temperature, and critical dimensionless rate of heating). The va- 
riety of forms for the critical ignition parameters reﬂects different 
representations of the conditions leading to ignition. While differ- 
ent in form, they all deliver a common parameter – a critical tem- 
perature – that reﬂects a local energy balance at the reaction zone. 
Thus, the critical parameters presented in Table 4 are also valid for 
a smouldering reaction. However, the conditions that lead to that 
critical parameter are limited. None of the formulations stemming

Main dimensionless parameters for the analysis of a 1D smouldering front prop- 
agation. This table assumes: ( i ) local thermal equilibrium, ( ii ) negligible pressure 
drop across the smouldering front (i.e., high permeability bed) – Darcy’s law 
becomes trivial [123] , ( iii ) one-step global reaction, and ( iv ) the pore space is 
saturated with gas. Therefore, the dimensionless numbers can be grouped into: 
ﬂuid ﬂow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions and heat transfer. Note that the 
dimensionless numbers deﬁnitions presented here may vary depending on the 
length scale used. See Symbols and Nomenclature for variable deﬁnitions. More 
details on each dimensionless number can be found in the references presented 
in the table. 

from  a  local  energy  balance  are  capable  of  describing  the  effect 
that thermal and species transport between gas and solid phases 
in the porous medium can have on the reaction. 

The identiﬁcation of the roles of global and local energy bal- 
ances on the onset of self-sustained smouldering propagation makes 
evident the need for a much more precise understanding of heat 

and  mass  transfer  processes  within  porous  media.  Existing  igni- 
tion  criteria  presented  in  Table  4  remain  valid  for  the  ignition 
of self-sustained smouldering , nevertheless, these criteria are only 
relevant to self-sustained smouldering propagation if the heat and 
mass  transfer  processes  pertaining  to  the  global  energy  balance 
are properly quantiﬁed. Recent contributions on the actual exper- 
imental and numerical status of ignition research can be found in 
[209,236,237] . 

3.1.2. Experimental studies of ignition 

Most experimental studies on smouldering focus on character- 
izing the reaction’s propagation. Nevertheless, before propagation 
is attained, ignition has to be achieved. For this purpose, detailed 
ignition protocols have been described in the literature. These pro- 
tocols reﬂect the need to achieve a positive local energy balance at 
the reaction zone so that self-sustained smouldering can be attained, 
nevertheless, it has also been recognized, while not explicitly, that 
the overall energy input also needs to be suﬃcient to initiate self- 
sustained propagation . 

Fig.  13  summarizes  the  main  experimental  ignition  protocols 
used in the literature. In Fig. 13 a, the radiation source is placed 
a few centimetres above the fuel bed surface. This setup is similar 
to the cone heater used in [38 , 240] . The radiation source is driven 
by electrical thermal resistance arranged in a conical shape so that 
a calibrated amount of radiative energy (kW m − 2 ) can be supplied 
to the surface of the fuel bed. Typically, the external heater irradi- 
ates between 10 kW m − 2 and 70 kW m − 2 [48] but for materials 
such as polyurethane, heat ﬂuxes as low as 2–10 kW m − 2  have 
been reported to support smouldering ignition [241] . The conﬁgu- 
ration shown in Fig. 13 a corresponds to a radiative ﬂux traversing a 
semi-transparent medium (e.g., a quartz window) used to seal the 
top of the reactor to allow for downward airﬂow. In this conﬁg- 
uration, the surface absorbs most of the radiation because typical 
porous media that support smouldering have small radiative ex- 
tinction depths. In-depth radiation is neglected at the surface and 
the heat input is treated purely as a boundary condition. Heat is 
then  transferred  inwards  by  means  of  conduction,  radiation  be- 
tween the pores, and convection. Any radiative transfer from the

external source is treated in this manner and, as a result, the rate 
of in-depth heat transfer is limited by the surface temperature. 

Once the reaction starts, the reaction zone rapidly becomes the 
hottest region in the porous medium, and therefore becomes the 
source from which heat is transferred to other regions. To attain 
a positive energy balance at the reaction front, it is necessary to 
reduce  heat  transfer  to  regions  that  are  not  in  the  propagation 
path and maximize high temperatures along the bed depth. Stud- 
ies indicate that the location of the reaction relative to the system 
boundaries was critical to achieve ignition [144] . The lower bound 
of  the  ignition window  is  therefore deﬁned by  attaining a  posi- 
tive energy balance at the initial location of the reaction front. The 
other  parameters  inﬂuencing  temperatures  along  the  bed  depth, 
and the potential of radiation as an ignition source, are the fuel 
bed properties of the fuel bed such as porosity, effective thermal 
inertia ( k ρC p ), particle diameter, and solid-to-ﬂuid conductivity ra- 
tio [242-246] . This approach implicitly reﬂects the need for a pos- 
itive global energy balance. 

To understand ignition, it is necessary to evaluate the energy 
balance at the reaction zone. This requires a variety of simpliﬁca- 
tions. A common assumption is to consider an overall thermal con- 
ductivity resulting from the local thermal equilibrium of solid and 
gas. As established by Nield and Bejan [79] , if heat conduction in 
the solid and ﬂuid phases occurs in parallel, the effective thermal 
eff is the weighted arithmetic 
conductivity of a porous medium k 
= (1 − ϕ) k s + ϕk g . Farrag 
mean of the conductivities k s  and k g : k 
eff
et al. [247] shows experimentally that temperature has an effect 
on the effective thermal conductivity of the porous media. Thus, 
Farrag et al. [247] extends the deﬁnition of the effective thermal 
conductivity  to  a  function  of  temperature.  Convective  ﬂows  will 
inevitably exist in the porous medium, nevertheless, it has gener- 
ally been considered that they are suﬃciently small to maintain a 
thermal equilibrium framework and therefore to account for them 
only  a  correction  to  the  effective  thermal  conductivity  is  neces- 
sary. In a similar manner, radiation between pores has been ap- 
proximated by means of an effective thermal conductivity. Thus, 
the contribution of convection and radiation between the pores to 
the effective thermal conductivity is assumed to take an additive 
form  ( k 
rad ).  In  most  experimental  studies,  the 
eff
ﬂow rates and heating rates are set so that these conditions are 
preserved and the evolution of the temperature during the ignition 
period can be described by a purely conductive approximation.

A complicating aspect of smouldering ignition is that it has an 
upper ignition bound deﬁned by ﬂaming. The upper bound of the 
ignition window is deﬁned by a very different set of parameters 
and is highly dependant on the characteristics of the combustible 
material. Very few studies have explored this limit, therefore, it is 
not possible to provide a general description of this upper bound; 
nevertheless,  it  is  clear  that  in  most  cases  as  the  heat  ﬂux  in- 
creases, melting and/or gasiﬁcation will be promoted and lead to 
ﬂaming as opposed to smouldering [218] . In the case of some solid 
porous fuels, melting eliminates the porous structure, thereby pro- 
moting ﬂaming ignition. In a similar manner for CFIPM’s, a high 
heat ﬂux accelerates gasiﬁcation of the combustible material and 
promotes ignition in the gas phase. Given that the processes that 
deﬁne the upper limits of radiative heating are material dependant, 
it is not possible to deﬁne bounds that apply universally. Never- 
theless, the upper bounds for the ignition source for smouldering 
have been explored by several authors [28 , 60 , 241 , 248-253] mostly 
for polyurethane foams [241 , 252 , 253] . 

Practical  approaches  have  been  used  to  attain  the  conditions 
described above. In Fig. 13 b, ignition can be achieved by an em- 
bedded  conduction  source  [47 , 48 , 50 , 52 , 56 , 59 , 62 , 152 , 246 , 254 , 255] , 
placed between an inert porous bed and a bed of fuel that under- 
goes ignition. The objective is to increase the temperature of the 
heater beyond the ignition temperature of the primary fuel, while 
preventing its ﬂaming. Thermal equilibrium and an effective ther- 
mal conductivity remain the basic assumptions used to analyse this 
ignition protocol. It is noted that when the bed is comprised of a 
condensed fuel in an inert porous medium (where fuel is not ex- 
posed to the surface), then ﬂaming is not possible since the critical 
ﬂame diameter is greater than the pore size. 

To  overcome  the  limitations  of  radiative  ignition  and  to 
carry  heat  to  greater  bed  depth,  the  air  supply  can  be  heated 
[38 , 49 , 60 , 61] ( Fig. 13 c). In this case, heat transfer relies on local 
thermal non-equilibrium and is strongly inﬂuenced by the charac- 
teristics of the porous medium. Some experimental studies have 
used ﬂames as a source of heat ( Fig. 13 c) 45 , 256] . While ignition 
of certain fuels can be achieved by impinging a ﬂame, a ﬂame in- 
creases the temperature at the impingement point beyond the con- 
ditions that promote ﬂaming of the combustible material. Further- 
more, the combustion products from the ﬂame have low oxygen 
concentration, thus the ﬂame develops a region where the reduc- 
tion of oxygen supply promotes pyrolysis over the onset of smoul- 

20

dering  reactions.  Therefore,  the  generation  of  high  temperatures 
and low oxygen concentration regions make smouldering ignition 
by  means  of  a  ﬂame  very  diﬃcult  to  control  and  not  viable for 
most materials. A common procedure is to combine the heat of the 
ﬂame with a convective ﬂow, which is essentially the same pro- 
cess as igniting by heated air. No detailed theoretical framework 
has been used to quantify these types of ignition protocols. 

It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  none  of  these  studies 
achieved a detailed characterization of the heat and mass transfer 
processes during ignition. Thus, their analyses embed simpliﬁca- 
tions to accommodate their speciﬁc experimental conditions. 

In  summary,  experimental  ignition  protocols  for  self-sustained 
smouldering propagation intuitively aim to achieve common objec- 
tives:  ( i )  attain  a  critical  condition  that  delivers  a  positive  local 
energy  balance  ( self-sustained  smouldering );  ( ii )  ensure  this  criti- 
cal condition is achieved despite the inﬂuence of boundaries and 
global  thermal  conditions  within  the  reactor  ( positive  global  en- 
ergy balance ); ( iii ) maintain temperature below characteristic val- 
ues  that  promote  homogeneous  over  heterogeneous  combustion 
(i.e., avoid transition to ﬂaming); ( iv ) deliver local conditions (i.e., 
temperature  and  oxygen  concentrations)  that  favour  exothermic 
oxidation over endothermic pyrolysis. Note that these points are 
deﬁned by the characteristics of the ignition region. Therefore, the 
characteristics of self-sustaining smouldering propagation might, de- 
spite all effort s, be independent of the ignition method once the 
front is outside the distance of inﬂuence of the igniter and the ox- 
idation reaction dominates the energy balance. 

3.2. Extinction 

As the uses of smouldering vary, critical conditions that govern 
self-sustained  smouldering  and  propagation  are  becoming  more 
relevant. For example, smouldering extinction, which was once of 
primary interest to characterize smouldering as a ﬁre safety haz- 
ard, is now a key condition that deﬁnes the economic success of 
smouldering as a new technology for the destruction or conver- 
sion to energy of low caloriﬁc fuels. While smouldering ignition 
has received very little theoretical attention, extinction has been 
more carefully addressed. In the following section, the fundamen- 
tals of extinction are explored through classical theories and addi- 
tional insights are provided by experimental studies of extinction. 
Subsequently, Section 4.7 considers extinction from the perspective 
of a local and global energy balance. 

3.2.1. Fundamental principles of extinction 

To explain the state of smouldering extinction theory it is ﬁrst 
useful  to  introduce  key  concepts  developed  for  describing  ﬂam- 
ing extinction because many concepts are repurposed. The topic of 
ﬂame extinction has been extensively studied [257-260] and pro- 
viding a comprehensive review is beyond the scope of this study; 
only those studies relevant to smouldering will be presented here. 
Ultimately,  extinction  results  from  a  local  energy  imbalance, 
where energy is lost from the reaction zone faster than the en- 
ergy  can  be  released  from  exothermic  chemical  reactions.  This 
causes  the  chemical  processes  driving  combustion  to  cease.  Ex- 
tending from Semenov’s ignition criterion [224] , extinction condi- 
tions can be attained when the Damköhler number decreases be- 
low a critical value. Liñán [179] and Fendell [261] ﬁrst highlighted 
the use of Damköhler number to describe extinction and ignition 
in a counter-ﬂow diffusion ﬂame. Their theory draws heavily from 
the structure of diffusion ﬂames and solutions obtained require the 
use of high-activation energy asymptotic methods [262 , 263] . The 
same approach was used by Dosanjh et al. [75] to study smoul- 
dering extinction so it is helpful to brieﬂy review the analysis by 
Liñán [179] . 

The analysis aims at obtaining a critical Damköhler number that 
serves to characterize ignition and extinction. Assuming a one-step 
Arrhenius reaction that is ﬁrst-order with respect to the fuel and 
oxidizer, the temperature form of the steady-state energy equation 
is obtained:

k are the dimensional activation energy, ideal gas constant, pre- 
exponential factor, heat released per mass of fuel, the speciﬁc heat

derivations detailed in Chung et al. [264] and Fendell [261] , and 
using  the  Schvab-Zeldovich  procedure  with  equal  diffusivities  of 
mass and heat ( Le = 1), the non-dimensional temperature distribu- 
tion becomes:

where  erfc  is  the  complementary  error  function.  This  leads  to 
Eq. (23) being re-written as:

where the new boundary conditions become  ¯T = ¯T ∞ at χ = 0 and 
¯T = ¯T −∞ − θ at χ = 1. Here, θ is ( ¯T ∞ − ¯T −∞ ) . Liñán [179] then ob- 
tains the asymptotic solutions for four possible regimes: ( i ) nearly 
frozen ignition, ( ii ) unstable, partial burning where both reactants 
cross the reaction zone, ( iii ) premixed ﬂame where only one reac- 
tant leaks through the reaction zone, and ( iv ) near equilibrium, dif- 
fusion controlled. Solutions from these regimes illustrate the char- 
acteristic S-curve [179] that explains extinction conditions in diffu- 
sion ﬂames at a minimum Damköhler number and temperature. 

(26) 

A  number  of  theoretical  studies  have  built  from  this  method 
to understand smouldering extinction starting with Dosanjh et al. 
[75] . These authors used a very similar analysis to describe an op- 
posed smouldering front in one-dimension that is steady along the 
frame of reference travelling with the reaction zone. This is just an 
extension of the analysis developed by Liñán [179] when describ- 
ing a laminar premixed ﬂame. Furthermore, it assumes the smoul- 
der reaction can be described with a ﬁnite-rate, one-step reaction 
[262] . The conceptual form of the model is presented in Fig. 14 , 
where the comparison to a premixed ﬂame is quite clear, as the 
reactants are shown to enter the reaction zone from the bottom to

where Y O

extinction, the smoulder velocity can be set to 0, which implies 
θ = (cid:3)H . This can be rearranged to obtain the extinction condition:

(32) 

This implies that, at extinction, all the energy from the reac- 
tion is less than that necessary to heat the incoming reactants. This 
provides a reasonable criterion to describe extinction. 

Schult  et  al.  [64]  extended  this  analysis,  again  using  high- 
activation energy asymptotic methods, by including heterogeneous 
reaction rates and removing the assumptions regarding the small 
degree of conversion of solid and that the average heat capacity of 
the reactants remains constant. The physical condition for extinc- 
tion here is again identiﬁed as the heat released being less than 
the heat necessary to bring the incoming reactants to a smoulder- 
ing combustion temperature. Although these models are adiabatic, 
additional heat loss terms (e.g., to the environment, phase change 
of fuel, pyrolysis effects) could be included. It is also acknowledged 
that, as local thermal equilibrium is assumed, a multi-phase tem- 
perature description would also be helpful to improve the accu- 
racy and provide deeper physical meaning. This analysis expanded 
the understanding of governing extinction mechanisms under solid 
and gas deﬁcient cases and proposed additional key critical param- 
eters:  initial  oxygen  concentration,  stoichiometric  coeﬃcient,  gas 
heat  capacity,  activation  energy,  heat  released  per  mass  of  oxy- 
gen reacted, initial temperature, and the product of initial heat ca- 
pacity with density. The results from this analysis matched well 
with experiments performed by Ohlemiller and Lucca [180] but did 
not match extinction results from Torero et al. [144] . It is diﬃcult 
to fully resolve the speciﬁc assumptions that may be responsible 
for this discrepancy, but it certainly suggests that conditions gov- 
erning the smouldering extinction limits were not consistent be- 
tween the experimental result and the mathematical representa- 
tion. An important difference between the deﬁnition of extinction 
by Ohlemiller and Lucca [180] and that of Torero et al. [144] is that 
the latter considered extinction in the context of the spatial pro- 
gression of the smouldering front within the reactor ( self-sustained 
smouldering propagation ). Ohlemiller and Lucca’s [180] approach is 
instead  focused  on  a  terminal  condition  ( self-sustained  smoulder- 
ing ). The analysis of Schult et al. [64] refers to the ultimate ex- 
tinction of self-sustained smouldering , thus, is more suitable to the 
results of Ohlemiller and Lucca [180] . Decker and Schult [266] di- 
rectly expand upon this work and further investigated the dynamic 
effects of a smoulder wave near extinction. Lozinski and Buckmas- 
ter [177] also revisited Dosanjh et al. [75] ’s model and provided 
extra insight into the use of a temperature-dependant endother- 
mic pyrolysis term, as well as the use of a classical heat loss term. 
However, the solutions still required many simpliﬁcations, in par- 
ticular, the condition of local thermal equilibrium was asssumed 
in all these studies. Thus, the differences between global and local 
energy balances cannot be fully described in these analyses, and so 
their comparison with experiments remains limited. 

Repurposed  homogeneous  combustion  theory  has  led  to  rea- 
sonable simpliﬁcations and valuable solutions using high activation 
energy asymptotic techniques that provide adequate phenomeno-

the top (as the reaction is travelling downward). The parallel be- 
tween a porous matrix and a premixed ﬂame inevitably invokes 
the assumption of local thermal equilibrium between phases. 

Note that the proposed reactant transport for this model does 
not address the diffusion of oxidant through the pore space and 
into  the  surface  of  the  fuel.  Therefore,  the  scale  of  the  concep- 
tual  model  proposed  may  be  inappropriately  large,  and  a  global 
phenomenon (the extinction of self-sustained smouldering propaga- 
tion ) may be confused with the local phenomenon (extinction of 
self-sustained smouldering ). Nevertheless, the analysis provides use- 
ful insight into extinction and lays the foundation for smouldering 
extinction theories. 

By integrating the energy equation over the reaction zone and 
assuming  all  oxygen  is  consumed  and  diffusive  heat  and  mass 
transport is negligible (i.e., convective transport dominates) the en- 
ergy equation can be rearranged to express the smouldering veloc- 
ity ( v

logical explanations for self-sustained smouldering extinction. Nev- 
ertheless, there remains a signiﬁcant discrepancy between smoul- 
dering  extinction  theory  and  results  from  experiments.  Impor- 
tantly,  the  initial  conceptual  model  and  resulting  set  of  govern- 
ing equations and assumptions appear to require more attention, 
as ad-hoc approaches that build from Dosanjh et al. [75] ’s origi- 
nal analysis still seem to exclude phenomena that govern the ex- 
tinction of self-sustained smouldering propagation . Therefore, there 
is still a gap in the literature and room for a harmonized explana- 
tion of smouldering extinction. 

3.2.2. Experimental studies of extinction 

Only  a  few  experimental  studies  have  addressed  smoulder- 
ing extinction and in most cases the extinction process has just 
been characterized as a necessary condition to avoid ﬁre spread 
[144 , 222 , 223 , 267 , 268] .  Earlier  studies  established  air  ﬂow  limits 
(oxygen-limited  conditions)  that  resulted  in  endothermic  pyroly- 
sis reactions becoming dominant over exothermic oxidation [268] . 
This results in smouldering sustained by the heat of the igniter, 
so as soon as the igniter is turned off, extinction follows. While 
no detailed description of the sequence of events leading to ex- 
tinction was provided, these results provide evidence of the differ- 
ence between self-sustained smouldering and self-sustained smoul- 
dering propagation . 

The  progression  towards  extinction  (limits  of  self-sustained 
smouldering propagation ) was not discussed until the solid porous 
fuel studies by Torero et al. [144] where smouldering fronts were 
ignited,  initiated  propagation,  but  eventually  drifted  towards  ex- 
tinction. In Torero et al. [144] , the effects of buoyancy in opposed 
smouldering under downward and upward conﬁgurations were in- 
vestigated. In downward opposed smouldering, air ﬂows along the 
column’s cold walls towards the reaction zone, reaching the vir- 
gin fuel region. Since the virgin fuel has relatively low permeabil- 
ity, air returns and moves upward along the centre-line with the 
forced air. This excess of air enhances the reaction front by provid- 
ing more oxygen, but also can cool it and lead to extinction if the 
reaction is already weak. In upwards opposed smouldering, extinc- 
tion occurs due to buoyant ﬂows that oppose and partially cancel 
the air ﬂux. After extinction, residual char is still oxidized by the 
remaining oxygen in the system, especially near the igniter where 
temperatures are high. These effects of buoyancy are relevant pri- 
marily to porous solid fuel (PSF) systems with low air ﬂuxes. 

For forward smouldering of condensed fuels in inert porous sys- 
tems,  it  has  been  shown  that  progress  towards  extinction  looks 
similar, regardless if caused by low air ﬂux,  low fuel concentra- 
tion,  very  low  oxygen  content,  low  fuel  energy  content,  or  high 
heat losses [81] . Each of these either reduces the energy generated, 
or increases the energy lost, such that the local energy balance be- 
comes negative. 

Experimental studies support these observations. For example, 
heat losses to the perimeter of the reactor were studied and quan- 
tiﬁed by [38 , 80 , 223] . Bar-Ilan et al. [223] quantiﬁed the losses by 
the identiﬁcation of a minimum reactor size necessary to sustain 
one-dimensional smouldering propagation. Zanoni et al. [80] found 
that 28–52% of the total energy in a laboratory column smoulder- 
ing system was lost to the surroundings, agreeing with [38 , 129] . 
Such losses reduce the amount of energy that can be transferred 
forward, potentially leading to extinction. 

Studies on condensed fuels in inert porous media (CFIPM) sys- 
tems have demonstrated that smouldering extinction occurs if fuel 
concentrations are less than approximately 3 - 5 g fuel per kg of 
inert porous media [53] . Furthermore, local Darcy air ﬂuxes less 
than approximately 0.5 cm s − 1 in CFIPM systems also can lead to 
extinction [47 , 81 , 151 , 255 , 269] . In opposed smouldering for PSF sys- 
tems, extinction by convective cooling at high air ﬂuxes was found 
by  [144 , 222] ,  which  aligns  with  Eq.  (32) .  Under  oxygen-limited 

conditions, additional oxygen supplied by higher air ﬂux drives ad- 
ditional  heat  generation,  which  offsets  the  heat  removed  as  the 
gas  passes  through  the  reaction  front.  Under  fuel-limited  condi- 
tions, cold air passes through the hot sample, resulting in partial 
consumption of the oxygen and decreasing the peak temperature. 
The reduced oxygen environment favoured pyrolysis over exother- 
mic  oxidation  and  lead  to  extinction  [76 , 123 , 151] .  In  CFIPM  sys- 
tems, convective cooling only drives extinction at extremely high 
air ﬂuxes (e.g., above 30 cm s − 1 ) (further detailed in Section 4.4 ). 
In this case, the energy generation is instead limited by chemistry 
(i.e., kinetic-limited) then additional oxygen supplied by higher air 
ﬂuxes  does  not  drive  the  same  increase  in  heat  generation,  and 
may  not  offset the  heat  removed as  the  gas passes through  the 
reaction front. Ultimately, this may also result in decreasing peak 
temperatures and lead to extinction [76, 123, 151]. 

Moisture  content  (MC)  of  the  fuel  is  also  a  heat  sink  and 
thus  affects  the  energy  balance  critical  to  extinction.  A  “criti- 
cal  MC” is  deﬁned  as  a  practical  extinction  limit  in  which  self- 
sustaining smouldering cannot be achieved. The concept of a criti- 
cal MC is often discussed with respect to the smouldering of peat 
[16 , 108 , 109 , 201 , 202 , 270] .  However,  there  remains  an  opportunity 
for  further  research  to  provide  a  robust  mechanism  to  fully  ex- 
plain the role of moisture content in smouldering propagation and 
smouldering extinction. 

The  study  by  Torero  et  al.  [144]  deﬁned  a  methodology  that 
focused  on  the  evolution  of  the  smouldering  reaction  as  it  pro- 
gressed  through  the  reaction  front.  Only  this  new  approach  al- 
lowed  to  experimentally  separate  the  effects  of  the  local  and 
global energy balances on extinction. Therefore, this methodology 
allowed  differentiation  of  extinction  of  self-sustained  smouldering 
from the arrest of self-sustained smouldering propagation . 

3.3. Transition to ﬂaming 

Transition from smouldering to ﬂaming combustion is a process 
that is relevant only to porous solid fuel (PSF) systems. Systems 
containing condensed fuels in inert porous media cannot experi- 
ence transition to ﬂaming within the matrix. Flaming is possible 
under some circumstances when the reaction approaches an open 
boundary with a semi-volatile fuel present in the adjacent matrix. 
However, all transition to ﬂaming research focuses on PSF systems, 
where this event poses a serious ﬁre hazard, and thus is the focus 
of this section. 

The basic principles behind this process were ﬁrst discussed by 
Ohlemiller [222] and later reviewed by Santoso et al. [271] . The 
former study predates most of the studies that look at the evolu- 
tion in space and time from smouldering towards ﬂaming, and the 
latter focuses on a phenomenological description focused on the 
transition from smouldering to ﬂaming in wildﬁres. Santoso et al. 
[271] also provide a detailed review of other transition to ﬂam- 
ing studies. These are also discussed here for completeness and to 
establish evidence of the importance of the local and global en- 
ergy balances in the transition from smouldering to ﬂaming. Nev- 
ertheless, for a detailed list of all studies devoted to this matter 
the reader should consult Santoso et al. [271] . 

In  a  similar  manner  to  ignition  and  extinction,  transition  to 
ﬂaming  is  a  process  that  is  inﬂuenced  by  the  different  thermal 
time scales; thus, it needs to be studied employing local thermal 
non-equilibrium conditions [161] . There are very few studies that 
systematically  study  transition  to  ﬂaming  [161 , 222 , 267 , 272-275] . 
Tse et al. [272] established that transition to ﬂaming is ultimately 
driven by an increase in the local energy supply that favours gasi- 
ﬁcation over heterogeneous combustion. Nevertheless, the condi- 
tions that lead to this increased energy release are dominated by 
changes in the nature of the porous matrix that affect the trans- 
port of oxidizer to the reaction zone. The observations by Tse et al. 

J.L. Torero, J.I. Gerhard and M.F. Martins et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 81 (2020) 100869 

23 

[272] therefore only apply to materials, such as polyurethane foam, 
where  consumption  of  the  fuel  changes  the  morphology  of  the 
porous matrix. 

Forward smouldering in porous solid fuels (i.e., reactive porous 
media)  was  considered  a  precursor  of  transition  to  ﬂaming 
[272 , 273] . Literature shows four possible factors affecting the tran- 
sition to ﬂaming under either natural or forced air forward smoul- 
dering: ( i ) strong secondary char oxidation behind the front, ( ii ) 
acceleration of the smouldering front velocity, ( iii ) increase of oxy- 
gen supply, and ( iv ) increase in sample size.  Smouldering of  re- 
active porous matrices typically leaves unburnt char (highly per- 
meable  matrix  with  large  pore  diameters)  behind  the  front  due 
to oxygen-limited propagation and heat losses. Residual char re- 
mains as an insulating material [180 , 221 , 222] . Under speciﬁc con- 
ditions, pyrolysis gases might circulate in convective currents in- 
side  the  large  pores  within  this  residual  char  [272] .  When  air 
reaches the residual char region, char oxidation occurs and, if suf- 
ﬁciently energetic, it can ignite the pyrolysis gases (if ﬂammability 
limits and suﬃcient heat are attained [274] ) that might be circu- 
lating in the large pores, thereby causing the transition to ﬂam- 
ing [143 , 180 , 219 , 222 , 272-274 , 276] . Note that the formation of large 
pores is a necessary but not a suﬃcient condition for transition to 
ﬂaming, since large pores were found in ﬂaming and non-ﬂaming 
conditions [273] . 

Bar-Ilan et al. [276] suggested that high front velocities might 
cause transition to ﬂaming. On the other hand, Tse et al. [272] and 
Putzeys et al. [273] showed that the front velocity sometimes de- 
creases as transition to ﬂaming is approaching, indicating that an 
increase in the front velocity is not the primary cause of transition 
to ﬂaming. Furthermore, the front velocity is a function of multi- 
ple factors, such as the location of oxygen consumption. Transition 
to ﬂaming was often observed as the higher temperature char ox- 
idation was enhanced. The enhanced char oxidation consumes a 
larger fraction of the oxygen, which in turn has the potential to 
slow down the smouldering reaction [272] . 

Large  oxygen  concentrations  ( > 30%)  are  also  suggested  as  a 
cause of transition to ﬂaming [117 , 273 , 274] . The increase in oxy- 
gen concentration increases the reaction rate of the char oxidation, 
consequently increasing the heat release rate and local tempera- 
tures [142 , 273 , 276] . Note that high air ﬂuxes may cause the same 
effect. However, although an increase in air ﬂux will enhance the 
oxygen mass ﬂux, high air ﬂuxes may decrease the front tempera- 
ture by convective cooling [274] . 

Finally, large samples were observed as another condition nec- 
essary for transition to ﬂaming. In small samples, heat losses dom- 
inate and extinction occurs. However, small samples can transition 
to ﬂaming when exposed to high oxygen concentrations [272] . 

The limited literature on transition to ﬂaming does not fully es- 
tablishing all the variables involved in this process. Nevertheless, 
it is clear that the interplay between the global energy and local 
energy balances determines the conditions necessary to shift from 
heterogeneous to homogeneous reactions. As discussed for prop- 
agation,  ignition,  and  extinction,  the  global  energy  balance  pro- 
vides an essential component of the local conditions at the reac- 
tion zone. For transition to ﬂaming, the region of signiﬁcant inter- 
est does not seem to be at the smouldering front, but rather at 
the trailing char oxidation front. Given the importance of this phe- 
nomenon for ﬁre safety, this is an issue that needs to receive much 
greater attention.

and liquid phases separately (left and middle). The liquid shown is water, but oil in

age grain diameter of 0.65 mm, porosity = 0.44, saturation (i.e., fraction of porosity

global (i.e., full system, bed) scale. The integral of these processes, 
in conjunction with boundary conditions, such as perimeter heat 
losses,  provides  a  net  energy  balance  that  evolves  in  time  and 
properly describes self-sustained smouldering propagation . The over- 
all energy balance serves to deﬁne a local energy balance at the 
reaction zone so, at any given time, the smouldering reaction may 
be robust and self-sustaining, weak and self-sustaining, declining, 
or extinguishing. Further details about such an analysis are given 
in Section 4.7 . 

The key parameters controlling the nature of the smouldering 
process are the fuel and heat and mass transfer processes to and 
away from the reaction zone. As indicated in Section 1 (Introduc- 
tion), there are two systems of primary interest: porous solid fuels 
(e.g., polyurethane foam, coal, and tobacco) and condensed-phase 
fuels  (solid,  liquid,  sludge)  embedded  in  an  inert  porous  matrix 
(e.g.,  oil  shale,  tar-contaminated  soil,  engineered  mixtures  of  or- 
ganic material and sand). In the discussion below, key common el- 
ements between these two types of systems are identiﬁed, as well 
as  signiﬁcant  differences  between  them.  Furthermore,  these  will 
be discussed in the context of speciﬁc characteristics of the heat 
transfer processes. 

4. General conceptual model of smouldering propagation 

4.1. Fuel bed characteristics 

In this section, the goal is to provide a summary of key ele- 
ments of a conceptual model of smouldering propagation. Smoul- 
dering propagation, as outlined in Section 2 , is the result of heat 
and mass transfer processes integrated in space and time at the 

Smouldering is a heterogeneous combustion reaction, with oxy- 
gen  (gas)  penetrating  the  surface  of  the  combustible  material 
(solid). Smouldering requires the fuel to exist either as a porous 
medium itself or to be embedded within a porous medium. Porous

solid fuels (PSF) (e.g., polyurethane foam, coal, and tobacco) pro- 
vide a reactive porous medium. In contrast, condensed fuels in in- 
ert porous media (CFIPM) constitute inert media (e.g., sand, soil, 
rock, metal or ceramic beads) containing solid, liquid, or semi-solid 
fuel distributed in its pores and pore throats. Fig. 15 , with exam- 
ples of these two systems, demonstrates some similarities and also 
some clear differences between the two. The differences are quan- 
tiﬁed in Table 5 . 

Porous  solid  fuels,  in  comparison  to  condensed  fuels  in  inert 
porous media, are relatively reactive, immobile materials that con- 
tain large pores. Their high surface area to volume ratios support 
robust heterogeneous reactions and their large pores support the 
transport  of  reactants  and  products  in  and  out  of  the  reaction 
zone (e.g., Fig. 15 a). The macroscopic properties of the bulk ma- 
terial include high porosity, high pore connectivity, high effective 
permeability to air, low thermal conductivity, and low volumetric 
heat capacity. If it is an anthropogenic material (e.g., foam, tobacco 
product) then it is likely very homogeneous at the bed scale. Since 
the matrix is reactive, fuel shrinkage is common, which may dam- 
age the integrity of the smouldering front under certain conditions. 
Moreover,  smouldering  of  porous  solid  fuels  typically  leaves  un- 
oxidized char behind, which insulates the front against heat losses. 
Complete consumption of the char is generally prevented by en- 
hanced heat losses induced by the transformation of the porous 
matrix. For porous solid fuels, the void fraction is large and air sup- 
ply by natural convection is common, thus the reaction can often 
propagate in the absence of any forced ﬂow (i.e., air naturally en- 
ters the porous fuel induced by a density difference between hot 
gases inside and cold gases outside the system and boundary layer 
ﬂows [122 , 219 , 282-284] ). Fig. 16 illustrates several common exam- 
ples of PSF. 

Condensed  fuels  in  inert  porous  media  provide  contrasting 
properties. The fuel may: ( i ) be embedded within the microporos- 
ity of the inert porous medium (e.g., pyrolyzed sugar within alu- 
mina particles [269] ), ( ii ) exist as a thin liquid or solid coating of 
the inert media grains at low fuel concentrations (e.g., oil sands), 
( iii ) occupy a fraction of the porosity at higher concentrations (e.g., 
oil-contaminated soil in Fig. 17 c), ( iv ) entirely ﬁll the porosity (e.g., 
oil-soaked insulation), or ( v ) may be at concentrations so high that 
the porosity is exceeded, where the inert grains are expanded from 
a  typical  packing  structure  – perhaps  losing  direct  contact  with 
each other – and the total volume of the mixture is larger than 
the volume of the inert medium alone. The latter is possible, for 
example, when artiﬁcially mixing organic wastes with inert or or- 
ganic media for waste treatment (e.g., [57] ). Fig. 17 provides exam- 
ples of the wide range of materials that are CFIPM. 

In  all  of  these  cases,  signﬁcant  shrinkage  of  the  bed  during 
smouldering  does  not  occur.  If  the  inert  medium  is  quartz  and 
was  dry  when  exposed  to  the  organic  material,  then  the  quartz 
is likely hydrophobic; however, if the quartz was initially wet then 
it is likely hydrophilic, with a thin layer of water between the fuel 

and the grain [288] . Therefore, the portion of the porosity not oc- 
cupied by fuel may be air-ﬁlled or water-ﬁlled. The macroscopic 
properties include a relatively low effective air permeability (this is 
the product of the inert media intrinsic permeability and the rela- 
tive permeability reduction associated with the fraction of porosity 
that is occupied). These systems also exhibit relatively low poros- 
ity, smaller average pore size, and potentially wider distribution of 
pore sizes (function of grain size and grain size distribution). More- 
over, they exhibit relatively high thermal conductivity, high volu- 
metric heat capacity, and higher dry bulk density. The surface area 
to volume ratio of the fuel is less than PSF systems and is a func- 
tion of fuel saturation [38] . In addition, liquid fuels are potentially 
mobile due to liquid phase hydraulic gradients, inﬂuenced by gas 
phase pneumatic gradients, and affected by temperature-induced 
viscosity reductions [50] . 

The characteristics of the porous matrix and the fuel have im- 
portant implications for the relevant mass transfer, heat transfer, 
heat  generating,  and  heat  loss  processes.  Fig.  18  illustrates  the 
key mass and heat transfer processes for PSF and CFIPM systems. 
The two types of systems have many processes in common, albeit 
their relative magnitude and importance may differ. For exam ple, 
in both cases the heated fuel, char, and any ash will transfer heat 
to the walls (items 4, 9 and 14 in Fig. 18 ), heat will be transferred 
perpendicular to propagation (item 10) and heat will be transferred 
by conduction and radiation through the pores (items 3 and 7, re- 
spectively).  However,  there  are  certain  mechanisms  that  will  be 
present in one type of system but not the other. For example, the 
inert matrix will retain heat, thus heat losses from the heated bed 
behind the front will be important for CFIPM but not for PSF. The 
energy retained in the inert bed can enable combustion to con- 
tinue until fuel is fully consumed in CFIPM while, in the case of 
PSF, heat losses often extinguish the reaction before the fuel has 
been completely consumed. Thus, PSF systems are likely to result 
in chars that will rapidly cool down and remain after smouldering. 
While this is possible for CFIPM’s, it is uncommon because the in- 
ert porous medium is a major heat reservoir. For the same reason, 
radial heat losses through the wall (item 9) are more signiﬁcant 
for CFIPM than for PSF systems. 

The implications of these pore- and macro-scale properties on 
smouldering behaviour are many and important. As a ﬁrst illustra- 
tive example, a reasonable assumption for PSF smouldering stud- 
ies is that local thermal equilibrium (LTE) exists between the fuel 
and the air [111] . However, this is not the case for CFIPM systems 
due to ( i ) the high contrast in thermal properties between the ma- 
trix  and  the  air,  ( ii )  the  higher  local  air  ﬂow  velocities  and  ( iii ) 
the potentially smaller surface to volume ratio. Thus, accounting 
for local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) might not be necessary 
for PSF but essential for CFIPM [246] . Zanoni et al. [152] , employ- 
ing a new LTNE correlation function [246] for CFIPM systems using 
sand, demonstrated a normalized average temperature difference

as great as 36% between the air and solid at typical air ﬂow rates 
for smouldering of bitumen in sand. 

The role of intrinsic permeability provides a second illustrative 
example. The intrinsic permeability to air can range over 7 orders 
of magnitude in CFIPM systems ( Table 5 ), and the effective per- 
meability (i.e., additionally accounting for fuel concentration) ex- 
pands that several orders of magnitude further – always towards 
lower values. Therefore, for CFIPM systems, natural convection is 
insuﬃcient to support smouldering in most instances. Rather, sig- 
niﬁcant pressure gradients are required to deliver forced air ﬂow 
at  a  suﬃcient  oxygen  mass  ﬂux  to  sustain  smouldering.  Heuris- 
tic studies have suggested local, macroscopic values of ∼ 0.5 cm 
s − 1  Darcy  air  ﬂux  (volume  of  air  per  unit  total  cross-sectional 

area perpendicular to ﬂow) are required to sustain applied smoul- 
dering  (e.g.,  organic  liquid  embedded  in  a  coarse  sand  in  a  pi- 
lot  treatment  reactor  [55] ).  Many  examples  of  PSF  fuel  matrices 
have shown that as the smouldering front progresses through the 
sample the permeability can increase several orders of magnitude 
due  to  the  transformations  occurring  within  the  porous  matrix 
[219 , 282] . The increase in permeability can enable signiﬁcant buoy- 
ancy induced ﬂows that can sustain or extinguish a smouldering 
reaction  [220] .  Thus,  while  peat  (PSF)  will  smoulder  indeﬁnitely 
fuelled by natural convection, leading to catastrophic peat forest 
ﬁres [204] , smouldering of tar-contaminated soil (CFIPM) will stop 
immediately when injected air ﬂow is terminated [48] . Moreover, 
CFIPM systems will typically have a threshold of effective perme-

ability below which insuﬃcient oxygen can be delivered and thus 
smouldering is not possible; therefore, smouldering is not possible 
in clay. While elevated air ﬂows are predicted to provide convec- 
tive cooling of the reaction in PSF systems, this is not observed for 
CFIPM systems for practical values of air ﬂux (e.g., 1 – 10 cm s − 1 ) 
[59 , 81] . 

Other effects, while different in nature, appear in both PSF and 
CFIPM  systems.  Mobility  of  the  fuel  is  one  such  process.  Mobil- 
ity of fuel can be a beneﬁt or a drawback that appears in both 
PSF and CFIPM systems. Oil mobilization ahead of the smouldering 
front is intentional in ﬁre ﬂooding for enhanced oil recovery. It can 
also  be  a  beneﬁt  for  waste  destruction  for  oil-contaminated  soil 
if the liquid cascades downwards into the front, feeding continu- 
ous smouldering. Kinsman et al. [50] demonstrates this effect and 
provides a method to calculate the upwards air ﬂow rate that will 
counter downwards mobility of liquid fuel. However, migrating fuel 
can also cause unusual behaviour such as pseudo-super-adiabatic 
effects in which peak temperatures climb and front velocities de- 
crease [45] . In the case of PSFs, melting can result in liquid fuel 
migration or the collapse of the porous matrix. The ultimate im- 
pact  of  fuel  migration  is  uncertain,  nevertheless,  several  studies 
have reported phenomena such as pore clogging due to melting 
and leading to extinction [82 , 122 , 221] . 

As illustrated by the above examples, the nature of the fuel ma- 
trix can result in behaviour that is common or unique to the char- 
acteristics  of  each  particular  fuel.  Therefore,  when  analysing  the 
available data, it is important to extrapolate behaviour with cau- 
tion  because  speciﬁc  phenomena  can  manifest  itself  in  different 
ways whether smouldering is occurring in the context of a PSF or 
a CFIPM. 

4.2. Classic framework 

The complexity of the heat transfer processes requires simpli- 
fying the problem for study. The main simpliﬁcation is to idealize 
the processes within the framework of a one-dimensional smoul- 
dering wave, which can be further separated into two conﬁgura- 
tions: ( i ) ﬂow transfers heat away from the reaction towards the 
unburnt fuel (forward), and ( ii ) ﬂow transfers heat from the reac- 
tion towards the burnt region (opposed) ( Fig. 19 ). The direction of 
the smouldering front relative to the air ﬂux deﬁnes the conﬁgu- 
ration [3 , 143 , 180 , 282] . 

In  opposed  (also  known  as  ‘reverse’)  smouldering  ( Fig.  19 b), 
the  direction  of  the  smouldering  front  is  in  the  opposite  direc- 
tion to the air ﬂux [180] . Opposed smouldering typically occurs in 
conjunction with natural convection, in which air generally trav- 
els through the cold virgin fuel and reaches a reaction front that 
is travelling towards it. Smouldering of a coal pile, can occur in a 
similar manner even when ignited at the bottom. In this case the 
supply of oxygen is determined by air ingress at the top and sides 
of  the  pile  [292] .  Since  the  air  is  cold,  the  smouldering  front  is 
cooled down to heat up the gas [222] . Once the air is heated and 
passed through the front, convective heat transfer is towards the 
burnt region, resulting in less heat being transferred in support of 
propagation. Opposed smouldering is common for non-engineered 
PSF systems. 

Forward smouldering ( Fig. 19 a) is when both the front and air 
ﬂux travel in the same direction [180] . Cold air ﬂows into the burnt 
region, a portion of which is still hot, heating up the air. Convective 
heat transfer in the gas phase delivers energy to the front where 
additional energy is generated from oxidative reactions. Convective 
heat transfer then deposits energy in the cold fuel/matrix ahead 
of the front, where it is stored and contributes to pre-heating and 
fuel pyrolysis. In this way, forward smouldering stores and recy- 
cles  energy  in  a  manner  that  supports  self-sustained  smouldering 
propagation .  This  energy  eﬃciency  means  it  is  the  conﬁguration

are labelled the form of the fuel (PSF or CFIPM) in the system. 

of choice for applied smouldering and CFIPM systems. In fact, op- 
posed smouldering is often impossible in such systems due to the 
inherent thermal mass and chemical properties, which require the 
beneﬁt of energy storage and recycling to be self-sustaining. The 
focus  in  the  rest  of  this  review  is  on  forward  smouldering,  but 
many  of  the  concepts  are  still  relevant  to  opposed  smouldering. 
Moreover,  it  is  acknowledged  that  most  real-world  smouldering 
scenarios are multi-dimensional and that, in the cases where buoy- 
ancy is relevant, the ﬂow ﬁeld could result in simultaneous for- 
ward and opposed propagation [220] . Thus, this framework is used 
mostly  for  clarity  but  it  is  likely  that  most  cases  will  include  a 
combination of both forward and opposed propagation [143 , 282] . 

4.3. Distribution of temperature in space 

Smouldering  studies  have  regularly  used  temperature  as  the 
main indicator for the net energy balance in the system. Thus, it 
is useful to identify different regions and processes according to 
their spatial distribution with respect to temperature. Fig. 20 rep- 
resents a conceptual model of the vertical spatial distribution of 
temperature for a forward smouldering combustion reaction, de- 
picted at a single time. The ﬁgure contrasts PSF and CFIPM sys- 
tems and the corresponding changes in oxygen concentration, fuel 
concentration, and fuel composition. The ﬁgure further identiﬁes 
key regions, which will form the basis for the conceptual model of 
smouldering referred to throughout the rest of this manuscript. 

In Fig. 20 , the uppermost “Virgin Fuel” region is well ahead of 
the  smouldering  front  and  since  it  receives  only  cold  (less  than 
∼80 °C) gas ﬂow, the fuel is unaffected by the smouldering reaction 
and the region exhibits near-ambient temperature ( T 0 ). However, 
volatilized hydrocarbons and water vapour arriving by convection 
will condense/recondense in this region, altering the composition 
and moisture content of the fuel/matrix. Moreover, evaporation of 
water and liquid compounds can occur due to gas ﬂow.

Fig. 20.  Conceptual model of a forward upward smouldering front. Within the colours are labelled the form of the fuel and Inert Porous Media (IPM) in the system. Within 
the temperature and oxygen proﬁles (depicted at a particular moment in time) are labelled the heat transfer regions. This schematic highlights the two extreme cases, 
illustrating only the main differences in driving forces. 

In  the  “Preheating” region,  between  the  Smouldering  region 
and the Virgin Fuel region, the fuel/matrix is exposed to elevated 
temperatures (between ∼80 °C and ∼500 °C, fuel-dependant) trans- 
ferred  forward  primarily  by  convection  and  conduction.  The  air 
ﬂowing  through  this  region  exhibits  a  reduced  oxygen  fraction 
( Y O2,  f = x % in Fig. 20 b) due to partial consumption in the oxida- 
tion reaction that precedes it. At high fuel concentrations and low 
oxygen mass ﬂuxes, oxygen can be entirely consumed before en- 
tering this region ( Y O2,  f = 0% in Fig. 20 b). The upper part of this 
region (temperatures between ∼80 °C and 220 °C) is characterized 
by inert heating, including the volatilization and boiling of  light 
hydrocarbons and water. The lower part of this region (tempera- 
tures between ∼220 °C and 550 °C) is dominated by assisted ther- 
mal degradation (see Section 2 Nomenclature). Most importantly, 
the signiﬁcant energy transferred forward from below supports the 
generation of a solid porous char by endothermic pyrolysis. 

The boundary between the “Preheating region” and the “Smoul- 
dering region” is characterized by the temperature exceeding the 
ig  ∼550 °C)  and  an  in- 
smouldering  ignition  temperature  (e.g.,  T 
creasing  oxygen  concentration.  In  this  region  the  char  has  ex- 
ceeded the activation energy for exothermic oxidation and there is 
suﬃcient oxygen for oxidation to proceed. Temperatures rise dra- 
matically in this region, with the reaction “front” coincident with 
the location of the maximum rate of energy release and the peak 
temperature ( T max ) (e.g., ∼700 – 1200 °C). T max is primarily depen- 
dant on the type (energy content) and concentration of fuel in the 
system. The majority of oxygen consumption occurs in this region. 
Generally, the smouldering region is quite thin, on the order of mm 
38 , 152] to cm [50] for CFIPM, whereas this region can be thicker 
for  PSF  [76 , 111] , for  which  the  local  rates  of  energy  release  and 
storage are lower and thus the energy is more widely distributed. 
The boundary between the “Smouldering region” occurs when ox- 
idation reactions no longer occur, but the reasons are different for 
CFIPM systems and PSF systems. For inert porous media systems 
that exhibit smouldering propagation, in which the energy storage 

and recycling is so high, this occurs where the fuel is eliminated 
from the bed ( Fig. 21 a). However, for porous solid fuels, in which 
a much higher fraction of the generated heat is lost, this occurs 
where  the  temperature  falls  below  that  required  for  exothermic 
oxidation. Thus, in the latter, residual char with some (pyrolyzed) 
organic content typically remains behind the front ( Fig. 21 b). 

After the “Smouldering region”, CFIPM systems exhibit a “Heat 
Storage” region not observed in PSF systems. The storage of heat 
in CFIPM systems is associated with the high-volume fraction of 
inert (mineral) content, which exhibits a high heat capacity. No re- 
actions occur beyond the “Smouldering region” and therefore the 
oxygen remains constant at the initial concentration ( Y O2,0 ) deliv- 
ered from the lower boundary. In the “Heat Storage region”, the 
rate  of  change  of  temperature  depends  primarily  on  radial  heat 
losses [150 , 152] . Radial losses depend, in turn on the surface area 
to volume ratio of the system. In laboratory column reactors, tem- 
perature decreases here can be large, while in larger constructed or 
ﬁeld systems, the “Heat Storage region” can exhibit a nearly con- 
stant temperature plateau extending for considerable distance be- 
hind the smouldering front. The heat storage region plays an im- 
portant role in the signiﬁcant energy recycling and high energy ef- 
ﬁciency of CFIPM systems. 

The “Cooling region” completes the proﬁle extending to ambi- 
ent temperature at its lower boundary. It is characterized by a rel- 
atively rapid temperature decay, dominated by local thermal non- 
equilibrium convective heat transfer from the hot bed to the in- 
coming cold air. 

4.4. Evolution of the reaction in space and time 

The entire heated proﬁle, from “Virgin Fuel region” to “Cooling 
region”, propagates in space and evolves in time, as the distribu- 
tion of energy in the smouldering system evolves. Fig. 22 illustrates 
a sequence of these proﬁles for smouldering propagation that is 
initially  self-sustaining  and  then  experiences  a  transition  toward

extinction. The “Preheating region” exhibits a relatively consistent 
rate of temperature increase, associated with the rate of forward 
heat transfer. If water was present, a plateau at ≤100 °C [56] would 
be observed at the front end of the thermal front until all the wa- 
ter was removed. 

After  ignition,  the  temperatures  observed  in  the  "Self- 
sustaining"  region  exhibit  repeating  temperature-time  proﬁles 
crossing each other up to a consistent peak temperature as the re- 
action propagates ( Fig. 22 ). This is a deﬁning characteristic of self- 
sustained smouldering propagation . The leading edge of the “Smoul- 
dering region”, identiﬁed by the steepest temperature rise in time 
( Fig.  20 b),  maintains  an  approximately  constant  velocity  as  long 

as:  ( i )  bed  conditions  (fuel  concentration,  intrinsic  permeability, 
air ﬂux, etc.) at and ahead of the smouldering front are constant, 
and ( ii ) the boiling front for water or volatile compounds remains 
far from the smouldering front. Such conditions are common for 
self-sustaining smouldering systems that are robust (i.e., the de- 
gree to which the reaction resists extinction; see Section 4.7 for 
further details). It is not uncommon, at least in CFIPM systems, for 
the heated proﬁle to thicken with time (particularly thickening the 
“Heat Storage region”), indicating increased cumulative energy in 
the system. In these cases, the energy extracted by the air from 
the inert media and radial energy losses are less than the energy 
produced by the propagating front. It is important to note that this 

30 

J.L. Torero, J.I. Gerhard and M.F. Martins et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 81 (2020) 100869 

is  not  necessarily  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  the  maximum 
reaction temperature. This is because the thickness of the heated 
proﬁle is a function of a global energy balance, while the reaction 
temperature is the result of local energy exchanges. 

The  illustrated  transition  from  self-sustaining  to  extinction 
( Fig. 22 ) is a dramatic example of an evolution in space and time 
that reﬂects a reduction in the net energy balance to below zero. 
This  could  be  due  to  any  parameters  increasing  the  energy  lost 
(e.g.,  increased  heat  losses  from  reduced  insulation  or  increased 
water content) or reducing the energy generated (e.g., reduced fuel 
concentration  or  reduced  air  ﬂow  rate).  After  the  transition,  the 
temperature proﬁles lose many of the distinctive features articu- 
lated above, and instead are dominated by diminishing peak tem- 
peratures, more gradual temperature increases in the “Preheating 
region”, and temprature proﬁles characteristic of heat transer only 
as energy dissipates throughout the system. 

The  behaviour  of  smouldering  propagation  is  sensitive  to  a 
number of key input and boundary parameters. These have been 
explored  in  both  experimental  [47 , 56 , 59 , 75 , 118 , 142 , 144 , 255 , 269 , 
293-296]  and  modelling  [7 , 16 , 75 , 76 , 108 , 118-120 , 122 , 123 , 129 , 141 , 
148 , 150 , 151 , 153 , 157 , 177 , 223 , 297 , 298]  studies.  Fig.  23  attempts  to 
summarize some of the sensitivity trends for temperature in time 
and in space. The sensitivity analysis for all the variables presented 
in Fig. 23 reﬂect the underlying, dominating inﬂuence of the en- 
ergy balance: the greater the net positive energy, the higher the 
peak temperature and the higher the front velocity. The different 
plots show the different manifestations on the energy balance in- 
duced by changes to these variables. Fig 23 is not intended to be 
speciﬁc to CFIPM or PSF systems, but instead to be a generalization 
of trends appropriate to both systems. 

The  top  panels  of  Fig.  23  illustrate  that  Darcy  velocity  in 
the  direction  of  the  front  propagation  (air  ﬂow  rate  per  unit 
cross-sectional  area)  has  a  strong  effect.  Higher  air  ﬂux  leads 
to  increased oxidation  rates  that  exceed  the  capacity  of  forward 
heat transfer resulting in an increase in peak temperature at the 
reaction front. It also results in more stored energy and a shorter 
“Cooling region” due to enhanced convective heat transfer. A clear 
result  of  increased  Darcy  velocity  is  an  increased  smouldering 
propagation  velocity.  Darcy  and  smouldering  velocities  can  be 
linearly  related.  This  is  because  convection  of  heat  from  the 
reaction to the unburnt fuel in the “Preheating region” dominates 
[7 , 47 , 59 , 75 , 76 , 81 , 118-120 , 122 , 123 , 129 , 144 , 151 , 153 , 157 , 177 , 255 , 269 , 
293 , 297] ; see example in Fig. 24 [59] . Fig. 24 demonstrates that at 
very high Darcy velocities (i.e., greater than 30 cm s − 1 ), convective 
cooling will start to deliver a decrease in the peak temperature. 
At these high velocities, the impact of LTNE between the air and 
solid  phase  is  signiﬁcant.  The  cold  air  entering  the  hot  reaction 
zone causes a cooling effect in the local energy balance, thereby 
dropping the peak temperatures. Despite the drop in peak temper- 
atures, forward convective heat transfer continues to increase and 
therefore the front propagation velocity continues to rise. 

Moreover, a key factor is whether excess oxygen exists beyond 
the  reaction  zone  or  whether  all  oxygen  is  consumed  (i.e.,  Y 
O2 , 
f = x % or Y 
O2 ,  f = 0% in Fig. 20 b). When excess oxygen exists (i.e., 
propagation is fuel-limited), all the available fuel is consumed for 
a set of heat transfer conditions. However, if all the oxygen is con- 
sumed for the same heat transfer conditions (i.e., propagation is 
oxygen-limited), not all the available fuel is consumed and, con- 
sequently, less energy is produced and the temperature and front 
velocity  are  negatively  affected.  This  issue  will  be  discussed  in 
greater detail in following sections. 

The sensitivity of smouldering to fuel concentration (saturation) 
illustrated in Fig. 23 is a prime example of this general phenom- 
ena. More fuel per unit volume always generates more total energy, 
with dramatic effects at low to intermediate fuel contents. How- 
ever, as the fuel approaches 50% of the porosity in CFIPM systems, 

the amount of fuel requires more energy to heat and more time 
to fully consume so the smouldering front slows down. Moreover, 
beyond 50%, oxygen is fully depleted and peak temperature and 
velocities are impacted even further [81] . Similar, but less sensi- 
tive, effects are observed for O 
2 mass fraction in the gas phase and 
the heat of combustion of the fuel, since increases in each produce 
more energy per unit mass of fuel oxidized. Moreover, the range 
of heat losses explored in Fig. 23 are insuﬃcient to affect the peak 
temperatures resulting from a robust local energy balance, how- 
ever, the temperature proﬁles reveal that increased heat losses de- 
crease the energy stored in the “Heat Storage region” ( Fig. 20 ). 

A further effect that cannot be observed in Fig. 23 but that has 
been reported in the literature [47 , 81 , 151 , 255 , 269] is that in the 
case of CFIPM systems, there is a minimum air ﬂux necessary to 
support self-sustained smouldering (on the order of 0.5 cm s − 1 ). 
Altogether this reveals that for applied smouldering, injected air 
ﬂux is one of the most useful parameters manipulated by the op- 
erator, allowing control of the mass rate of fuel destruction and 
terminating the reaction at will. In PSF systems (e.g., underground 
coal seams), characterized by minimal heat losses, high porosity, 
high permeability and other features of PSF systems ( Table 5 ), the 
low Darcy velocities of natural convection are suﬃcient to main- 
tain  self-sustaining  propagation;  this  is  one  reason  extinction  in 
such systems remains a key challenge [29 , 30] . 

4.5. Governing equations 

The articulated conceptual model comes out of the complex in- 
terplay of heat and mass transfer processes and chemical reactions 
that  evolve  in  space  and  time.  These  are  typically  described  via 
coupled momentum, mass, and energy conservation equations de- 
lineated at the macroscopic scale with Representative Elementary 
Volume (REV, the minimum volume over which averaging is mean- 
ingful) properties. The ﬁrst comprehensive mathematical represen- 
tation  of  a  propagating  smouldering  wave  is  due  to  Ohlemiller 
[7] and has been improved and reproduced by many others [3] , 
nevertheless, the essence of this framework remains the same. 

A  mathematical  description  of  the  relevant  processes  in  one- 
dimensional smouldering is summarized below. This applies to PSF 
systems and to CFIPM systems in which the fuel and the solid are 
assumed to have effective properties of a single solid phase. The 
conservation of mass [299] for the gas phase is deﬁned:

tion or production of chemical species as well as evaporation and

proaches: Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE) and Local Thermal Non- 
Equilibrium (LTNE). When assuming LTE, the temperatures of the

where φg = φ

O2,bk ), and Eq. (44) describes the transport of 
2 in the bulk gas ( Y

O2,sf ). The sink term ( Q O2 ) indicates 
2 at the surface of the solid ( Y 
O 
the depletion of oxygen by oxidation reactions on the fuel surface. 
Eqs. (43) and (44) are also linked by a mass transfer coeﬃcient 
( h m ) [302] . h m has not been studied beyond conventional textbook 
values and its determination still poses complex practical problems 
that have not been resolved. Thus, proper quantiﬁcation of t h m re- 
mains a key limitation to all existing mathematical models. Even 
the most recent studies use approximations for forward diffusion 
through the porous bed by modifying the gas phase diffusivity by 
a simple constant labelled the tortuosity factor [303] , but do not 
model diffusion of oxygen to the pore surface in an explicit man- 
ner [304] . Given that oxidizer diffusion to the surface could be the 
rate limiting mechanism, this hinders the use of numerical mod- 
els for the purpose of assessing the adequacy of different reaction 
mechanisms and their respective kinetic constants. 

When  certain  assumptions  are  made  (e.g.,  one-dimensional 
conﬁguration, simple reaction models, LTE, simpliﬁed source, ne- 
glecting sink terms [64 , 75 , 147] ), the above equations can be solved 
analytically.  Approximate  analytical  expressions  are  used  for  de- 
termining the structure of the smouldering front, the front prop- 
agation velocity, and the maximum (adiabatic) temperature at the 
combustion front [64 , 75 , 125 , 143 , 147-149 , 305] . 

Solution of these equations needs to address (and many times 
simplify) a comprehensive system of chemical kinetics; this is re- 
viewed in Section 2.4 Chemistry. The complexity of the system of 
equations  solved  must  be  commensurate  with  the  problem  un- 
der consideration. The above equations may be suﬃcient for ro- 
bust  smouldering  in  one-dimension  in  a  bed  of  ﬁxed  bulk  den- 
sity. For many cases of smouldering in natural and applied con- 
texts, they will need to be solved numerically to access a more de- 
tailed interplay of heat and mass transfer with chemical reactions 
in space and time. Explicit study of radial heat loss, front geome- 
try, and fuel/bed heterogeneity require multidimensional equations 
and  models.  Considering  a  bed  that  changes  under  smouldering 
(e.g., where the bulk of the system mass is carbon-based) requires 
an explicit analysis of the evolution of the porous medium, e.g., 
permeability and porosity changes. However, relatively straightfor- 
ward cases, such as those involving steady-state systems, can be 
investigated with analytical solutions. 

4.6. Analytic solutions 

Analytical  descriptions  of  different  aspects  of  smoul- 
dering  propagation  have  been  provided  by  many  authors 
[64 , 117 , 122 , 123 , 125 , 146-149 , 306-308] .  Three  distinct 
forward 
smouldering structures have been described: reaction leading, re- 
action trailing, and super-adiabatic ( Fig. 25 ). The deﬁnition of each 
structure is based on simple analytical assumptions, and the con- 
ditions that lead to structure change are still not well understood. 
However, since it is present in the smouldering literature, a brief 
summary will be described here for completeness. In the reaction 
leading structure ( Fig. 25 a), the chemical reaction front propagates 
faster than the heat transfer front, whereas in the reaction trailing 
structure  ( Fig.  25 b),  the  opposite  occurs.  In  the  super-adiabatic 
structure ( Fig. 25 c), the velocity of the reaction front overlaps the 
velocity of the heat transfer front, causing a steep increase in the 
combustion temperature ( T max ); in theory, it approaches inﬁnity. In 
practice, the reaction leading structure has been observed virtually 
for almost the integrity of the experimental research on forward 
smouldering  of  PSF  and  CFIPM  systems;  this  appears  to  be  the 
dominant structure for the practical conditions of interest to these 
systems.

sink term [80 , 81 , 152 , 223] . The means by which this term is quan- 
tiﬁed depends on the conﬁguration that is being approximated by 
Eq. (39) . For multicomponent systems where liquid and gas may 
occupy  the  pore  space,  effective  thermal  properties  for  the  con- 
densed (solid/liquid) phases are considered:

The interfacial heat transfer coeﬃcient ( h sg ) is typically deter- 
mined  from  an  empirical  Nusselt  number  ( Nu )  versus  Reynolds 
number ( Re ) and Prandtl number ( Pr ) correlation. The Wakao et al. 
[301]  correlation  has  been  widely  used  to  quantify  the  interfa- 
cial heat transfer coeﬃcient ( h sg ) [151 , 157] . However, it has been 
shown  to  over-predict  heat  transfer  between  phases  and  erro- 
neously  lead  to  conditions  that  tend  to  thermal  equilibrium  be- 
tween phases in smouldering systems [246] . A validated correla- 
tion for CFIPM systems with quartz sand matrix is:

valid for 0.5 ≤Re ≤31 [246] . This correlation shows that LTNE results 
over a much wider range of conditions than previously believed. 
Nevertheless, there is still a wide range of scenarios where within 
the REV the difference between the solid and gas temperature is 
negligible ( T g = T s = T ). In these cases, the hypothesis of LTE can still 
be made. 

Eq. (36) considers that all of the bulk oxygen is available for the 
oxidation  reaction.  Nevertheless, Leach  et  al.  [76]  suggested  that 
diffusion of oxygen into the surface of the fuel (here, fuel is the 
porous solid) might limit the reaction rate:

the context. The earliest front velocity models were empirical rela- 
tionships ﬁtted to experimental data from smouldering dust trains 
and board strips at various air velocities by Palmer [4] . These ﬁrst 
models postulated smouldering spread was limited by the oxygen 
supply to the smouldering surface and thus ﬁtted the experimen- 
tal data to a linear function of the airﬂow. Ohlemiller [7] later pro- 
posed the necessary equations to comprehensively model smoul- 
dering  but  resorted  to  a  numerical  solution.  It  is  Dosanjh  et  al. 
[75]  who  provided  the  ﬁrst  analytical  solution  for  the  front  ve- 
locity (see Eq. (27) ). Torero et al. [143 , 144 , 219 , 223] extended the 
theory from Dosanjh et al. [75] and developed a similar analytical 
expression for the front velocity based on an energy balance at the 
oxygen-limited reaction front, local thermal equilibrium, and two- 
step reactions (pyrolysis and oxidation):

Although analytical expressions are useful for general understand- 
ing of the process, in complex cases in which many chemical reac- 
tions take place, local thermal equilibrium is not valid, or further 
understanding  is  necessary,  evaluating  smouldering  with  simple 
analytical expressions provides insuﬃcient information. Numerical 
models have been used to release some of the assumptions nec- 
essary to obtain analytical solutions and to expand the exploration 
of parameters that cannot be varied within these models. 

4.7. Global energy balance 

As introduced in Section 2 , the ultimate characteristics of the 
smouldering front are the result of a local energy balance at the 
reaction  zone;  this  is  well  described  by  Dosanjh  et  al.  [75 , 122] . 
However, to fully describe the local energy balance, a global (sys- 
tem, bed) energy balance is needed. Fig. 26 illustrates the differ- 
ence between the local and global energy balance concepts; while 
a CFIPM system is illustrated as an example, the concepts and en- 
ergy components apply equally to both CFIPM and PSF systems. As 
shown, the global energy balance considers all the major sources 
and sinks in the system: the energy absorbed by pyrolysis, released 
by oxidation at different locations in the system, lost radially, en- 
tering the system (heater during ignition), and leaving the system 
(gas convection) (see equations in Table 6 ). This allows an individ- 
ual and cumulative treatment of all heat transfer time scales and 
links them to local heat transfer in the proximity of the reaction 
front. When the Net Energy Rate ( ˙ E net ) is positive, then the smoul- 
dering propagation is self-sustaining and the greater its magnitude, 
the more robust the smouldering. When  ˙ E net  falls below zero, the 
system predicts, in advance, that unless a parameter changes (e.g., 
increase in air ﬂow) smouldering will inevitably go extinct 80 , 81] . 
Using a numerical model, Zanoni et al. [152] described the role 
of the global energy balance to predict ignition and extinction for 
smouldering bitumen/sand mixtures. Details on the model and a 
sensitivity analysis can be found in ]80 , 81 , 152] . Here, a few pub- 
lished results are presented along with a suite of new results in 
order to illustrate the value of a global energy balance analysis in 
describing and explaining smouldering propagation, ignition, and 
extinction. While a CFIPM case is used for example, this type of 
analysis is applicable to all smouldering systems including PSF sce- 
narios. 

Figs.  27 a-c  describe  the  global  energy  balance  for  Case  1  (a 
robust smouldering propagation case): air ﬂux ( u g ) = 0.058 m s − 1 , 
2 ) = 0.204.

Fig. 25.  Forward smouldering front: (a) reaction leading (process dominated by the 
reaction layer, i.e., the reaction layer travels faster than the heat transfer layer); 
(b) reaction trailing (process dominated by the heat exchange layer, i.e., the heat 
transfer layer travels faster than the reaction layer); (c) super-adiabatic (the heat 
transfer later and reaction layer travel at the same velocity leading to a singularity 
in the peak temperature) (adapted from [125 , 147] ). 

From the analysis, a non-dimensional propagation velocity ( (cid:3)) 

for the smouldering front structure emerges [64 , 75 , 125 , 147 , 305] :

where [O

smouldering front structure is reaction leading ( (cid:3) < 1), reaction 
trailing ( (cid:3) > 1), and super-adiabatic ( (cid:3) = 1). Thus, following the 
assumptions above, an analytical expression for the smouldering 
front velocity ( v 
f ) and the combustion temperature ( T max ) were ob- 
tained:

Eq. (48) provides physical insight into the parameters controlling

in smouldering research. A fast front velocity may represent a sig-

is only ever 50% of the oxidation energy (magenta line, Fig. 27 b). 
This continuing positive energy balance causes energy accumula- 
tion  ( E net ) in  the  porous  medium  (red  line,  Fig.  27 c).  As  the  re- 
action approaches the end of the domain (DT = 1; i.e., dimension- 
less  time  of  1),  energy  leaves  the  system  via  hot  air  convection 
( ˙ E out ) (green line, Fig. 27 b). After this, all fuel is eliminated (i.e., 
oxid =  ˙ E pyr = 0  and  only  clean,  hot  sand  remains)  and  only  ˙ E 
˙ E 
loss 
and  ˙ E out are observed as the system cools ( Fig. 27 b). 

Figs. 27 e-g present Case 2, which is the same Case 1 but with 
lower air ﬂow ( u g = 0.014 m s − 1 ) [81] . In this case, the reaction suc- 
cessfully ignites but quickly diminishes and proceeds to extinction. 
Fig. 27 g reveals that  ˙ E net becomes negative at early time due to ra- 
dial energy losses exceeding oxidation energy gains ( Fig. 27 f). Here, 
it  is observed that  the  global energy balance predicts extinction 
will occur even when temperatures are high at the reaction front 
and  oxidation  is  active  ( Fig.  27 e).  In  other  words,  when  the  cu- 
mulative energy in the system, E net , starts decreasing while much 
fuel remains, failure is predicted ( Fig. 27 g). This is consistent with 
the transient extinction observations of Torero and Fernandez-Pello 
[143 , 219] and explains the discrepancies between these observa- 
tion and previous theoretical models. 

The  global  energy  balance  for  Cases  1  and  2  were  compared 
with the local energy balance ( Figs. 27 d and 27 h) at a single repre- 
sentative time (DT = 0.2; i.e., when the smouldering reaction propa- 
gated 20% of the length of the reactor) following the methodology 
presented in Zanoni et al. [81] . In Case 1 (self-sustaining propaga- 
tion), the local energy balance is dominated by the rate by which 
oxidation ( oxid ) delivers energy to the front ( Fig. 27 d). The convec- 
tive rate by which energy enters the front ( in ) exceeds the rate by 
which energy leaves the front ( out ). In addition to the energy out , 
it is necessary to add the rate of energy supply needed to sustatin 
pyrolysis ( pyr ). It is important to note that for the conditions stud- 
ied in this example the energy loss to pyrolysis is consistently low 
[80 , 81] . The radial heat losses ( loss ) is negligible in the local analy- 
sis due to a very thin front. In the global energy balance ( Fig. 27 d), 
there is no energy entering ( in ) or leaving ( out ) the system. More- 
over, global energy losses are not negligible, exceeding by 10 to 
20 times the local heat loss. For the global system, the net energy 
balance leads to less energy than the local balance, nevertheless, it 
still remains positive therefore the smouldering propagation is self- 
sustained ( Fig. 27 d). In this case, local and global energy analyses 
describe a scenario that is self-sustaining.

Fig. 27 h describes the local and global energy balances for Case 
2  (extinction-after-ignition).  It  is  clear  that  the  oxidation  energy 
rate is less than the previous case due to the lower oxygen mass 
ﬂux. In the local analysis, energy in and energy out of the front are 
essentially equal. At this time (DT = 0.2), oxidation is still occurring, 

while pyrolysis and heat losses are minor, which means the local 
net energy rate is positive. However, in the global energy balance, 
radial losses are much higher due to the long heated length. 

When radial losses are combined with the pyrolysis energy con- 
sumption rate, sinks exceed sources and the global net energy rate

is negative, in contrast to the positive local energy balance. This 
illustrates how the smouldering reaction can still be active while 
the global energy balance predicts that extinction is approaching. 
At this time, conditions could be altered (e.g., more heat added, 
heat losses reduced, air ﬂux increased) such that the global energy 
balance returns to positive and the smouldering propagation would 
switch to self-sustaining. 

b = 0.15,  O 

The same approach was used to study ignition, presented here 
for the ﬁrst time. Figs. 28 a-c show Case 3, a failure-to-ignite sce- 
nario  ( u g = 0.025 m  s − 1 ,  S 
2 = 0.204)  in  which  the  heater 
was turned on at t = 0 s and turned off at DT = −0.15 ( t = 3049.5 s). 
At the moment that the heater is turned off, the temperature at 
the  ﬁrst  thermocouple  starts  decreasing  ( Fig.  28 a)  and  only  in- 
creases again when the air is turned on, at DT = 0 ( t = 4926 s). How- 
ever,  this  increase  in  temperature  is  not  enough  to  create  self- 
sustaining conditions, i.e., oxidation is weak, decreasing with time 
and losses are high, increasing with time ( Fig. 28 b). This results in 
a negative net energy rate at DT = 0.237 ( t = 7070 s), causing a rapid 
extinction due to insuﬃcient heat supply for self-sustained smoul- 
dering propagation. These results have similar qualitative features 
to the observations that have led to most smouldering ignition ex- 
perimental protocols. 

Studies  conducted  to  develop  ignition  experimental  protocols 
demonstrated  that  it  was  not  suﬃcient  to  bring  the  reaction  to 
a critical ignition temperature (or Damköhler number to support 
self-sustained  smouldering ),  but  that  it  was  necessary  to  have  a 
positive global heat transfer environment to support self-sustained 
smouldering propagation . As evidence for this, this simulation was 
rerun (Case 4) except, this time, the heater was turned back on 
at DT = 0.237 ( t = 7070 s) and kept on until DT = 0.94 ( t = 13460s), 
which resulted in an increase in the temperature ( Fig. 28 d) suﬃ- 
cient to fully re-activate oxidation ( Fig. 28 e). This created an en- 
ergy balance that led to a positive global net energy rate ( Fig. 28 f) 
and achieved self-sustaining smouldering propagation. 

The four circled times shown in Fig. 28 c and 28 f were used to 
compare the global with local energy balances for these two cases. 
Figs.  29 a  and  29 b  describe  regions  (1)  and  (2),  respectively,  for 
the Case 3 (Failure to Ignite); Figs. 29 c and 29 d describe regions 
(3) and (4), respectively, for the repeat with re-ignition (Case 4). 
Fig. 29 a (DT = 0.237, t = 7070 s) reveals that, although the global net 
energy rate is zero, the local net energy rate is positive because 
oxidation is still active and local radial losses are small. At 7510 s 
(DT = 0.28,  Fig.  29 b),  the  non-self-sustaining  fate  of  the  reaction 
(due to insuﬃcient ignition) is indicated by a negative net energy

rate, whereas the local energy balance is still describing a positive 
net energy rate. This conﬁrms, now also for an ignition case, that 
the global energy balance predicts in advance the extinction (or 
non-ignition) of  the  front,  as  long  as  no  conditions  are  changed 
[80 , 81] .  Moments  after  the  heater  is  turned  back  on  ( Fig.  29 c), 
there is a sudden increase in the global net energy rate, which is 
entirely dominated by the input of energy from the heater (note 
that all the other components either for the local or global energy 
balances are unchanged, Fig. 29 c). The reinitiated heater provides 
the energy necessary to strengthen oxidation, consequently creat- 
ing a self-sustaining front with positive net energy rates locally and 
globally ( Fig. 29 d). 

The global energy balance is valuable not only  to  distinguish 
self-sustaining versus extinguishing cases, but also the robustness 
of the smouldering system. Robustness ultimately describes how 
far the system is from extinction. In these simulations, robustness 
is measured by the positive magnitude of the net energy rate at a 
given time, i.e., how rapidly excess energy is being generated and 
stored. A robust system can suffer mild or temporary negative cir- 
cumstances (e.g., temporary loss of air ﬂow, reaction reaching lim- 
ited zone of low fuel content) and survive to propagate in a self- 
sustaining manner. Fig. 30 illustrates this for a series of cases of 
varying operating conditions, including saturation, air ﬂux, oxygen 
content, heat of combustion, and radial heat losses. The ﬁgure re- 
veals that robustness of the system increases with increasing fuel 
saturation, air ﬂux, oxygen content of the air, and heat of combus- 
tion. It further illustrates that a minimum value in all of these pa- 
rameters is needed to avoid extinction. Robustness decreases with 
increases in heat losses and  a maximum  value must  not  be ex- 
ceeded to avoid extinction. The speciﬁc net energy rate values and 
extinction limits shown are speciﬁc to the cases examined, but the 
concepts and procedures are expected to be generally applicable 
across smouldering scenarios. The use of the global energy balance 
concept, in combination with traditional local energy balance met- 
rics, to better understand and control smouldering has signiﬁcant 
potential.

The introduction of the global energy balance allows full de- 
scriptions of the seven distinct processes identiﬁed in Section 2 . In 
the case of inert heating, the local energy balance is negative but 
the global energy balance is positive. Temperatures have not yet 
attained  conditions  that  introduce  signiﬁcant  heat  generation  or 
pyrolysis reactions. In the case of endothermic pyrolysis, the local 
energy balance is negative. The global energy balance is negative 
and the temperature has only increased to a magnitude where en- 
dothermic pyrolysis reactions proceed but oxidation reactions are 
yet  not  evident.  In  the  case  of  exothermic  degradation,  the  non- 
oxidative degradation chemistry can have exothermic components, 
therefore the local energy balance can be positive with no assis- 
tance  from  the  global  energy  balance.  In  assisted  thermal  degra-

dation, endothermic components are stronger than exothermic re- 
actions  and  therefore  the  local  energy  balance  needs  assistance 
from  the  global  energy  balance  for  the  reactions  to  proceed.  In 
self-sustaining thermal degradation that assistance is not necessary. 
In a similar manner, in self-sustaining smouldering the local energy 
balance is positive but the exothermic reactions are oxidative. The 
global  energy  balance  can  be  positive  or  negative.  As  explained 
above, if the global energy balance is negative the reaction will not 
propagate and eventually extinguish. If the global energy balance 
is positive, then smouldering propagation will follow. Furthermore, 
the relationship between the local and global energy balance can 
also serve to describe in a more comprehensive way ignition, ex- 
tinction, and transition to ﬂaming. And in all cases these apply to 
both PSF and CFIPM systems. 

Overall, the conceptual model of smouldering presented in this 
section integrates concepts developed over 50 years of smoulder- 
ing research. Moreover, it provides fresh perspectives on the con- 
tinuum of behaviour exhibited by porous solid fuels and condensed 
fuels  in  inert  porous  matrices.  Finally,  it  posits  this  conceptual 
framework in the language of local versus global energy balances, 
which can – for the ﬁrst time – explain the wide range of smoul- 
dering behaviours observed. 

5. Emissions 

5.1. Introduction 

The species associated emissions from smouldering combustion 
are often far more numerous and complex with many species ex- 
hibiting  much  greater  yields  than  for  ﬂaming  combustion  [309- 
312] . The spatial resolution of the different regions associated with 
smouldering  propagation  (see  Section  4 )  allows  for  a  complex 
combination  of  compounds  transferred  with  the  ﬂow  from  each 
stage of the degradation process. Furthermore, the heterogeneous 
oxidation steps are oxygen-limited [133 , 180] , since oxygen pene- 
trating the surface is diffusion-limited, despite a potential excess 
in bulk-phase oxygen, and therefore combustion is necessarily in- 
complete. The inert heating, pyrolysis, and exothermic degradation 
processes are well known to generate many complex gaseous com- 
pounds [3 , 313] . 

The basics of the processes ( Section 2 ) has been detailed above 
and  the  spatial  distribution  and  temporal  evolution  of  tempera- 
ture regions are detailed in Section 4 . In this section, our goal is 
to explicitly link these processes and regions with expected types 
of emissions. For example, in the inert heating region, volatile and 
semi-volatile non-water compounds can be distilled from the fuel 
as it is heated ahead of the front, thereby causing these substances 
to  change  to  the  vapour  state  while  experiencing  negligible  py- 
rolytic degradation [313-315] . These compounds will continuously 
recondense in the cold regions ahead of the front and re-volatilize 
as the self-sustained smouldering reaction progresses [142 , 316] . 

The  assisted  thermal  degradation  processes,  comprising  en- 
dothermic pyrolysis and exothermic degradation, exist in the hotter 
portion of the preheating region and thus precede the smouldering 
front. Pyrolysis of a fuel causes it to reduce to a solid, carbon-rich 
char while also degrading into condensable, semi-volatile compo- 
nents ubiquitously deﬁned as tars [313 , 317] . Gas phase compounds 
may also be formed by high temperature, oxygen-limited pyrolysis 
of the fuel or residual char, which may be referred to as gasiﬁ- 
cation [15 , 180] . The condensed phase fuel often produced, in part 
from  assisted  thermal  degradation,  is  the  fuel  which  undergoes 
smouldering  combustion  [110 , 313] .  The  tars  formed  through  this 
process can either undergo further degradation themselves or be 
emitted as condensable gaseous vapours. Assisted thermal degra- 
dation of a single species fuel can therefore create many different 
emission products, which are not formed from the oxidative com- 

bustion process but rather the high temperature, reduced condi- 
tions ahead of the self-sustained smouldering reaction. However, 
most fuels contain numerous species and their co-pyrolysis can re- 
sult in pyrosynthetic reactions whereby new species can be formed 
heterogeneously  and  homogenously  from  the  different  pyrolysis 
products interacting (e.g., [318] ). The assisted thermal degradation 
processes dominate emissions formation and the preheating region 
is the dominant emissions forming location associated with smoul- 
dering [313 , 319] . 

As indicated above, inert heating will produce emissions that 
will most likely recondense within the porous media and will not 
appear  unless  the  reaction  front  is  reaching  the  end  of  the  re- 
actor  [50] .  The  thermally  assisted  region  will  also  deliver  many 
species that will condense/recondense and follow the same  pat- 
tern as the products of inert heating. Nevertheless, several highly 
volatile  products  will  inevitably  emerge  through  the  integrity  of 
the process [143] . 

In smouldering combustion, the ratio of CO/CO 

2 is much higher 
than in conventional ﬂaming combustion. The exact ratio will vary 
depending on oxidant ﬂux to the reaction zone and fuel chemistry. 
CO and CO 
2  are predominantly produced from fuel oxidation but 
both can also be emitted during exothermic degradation, in partic- 
ular for biological fuels, with CO 
2 dominating the pair below 550 °C 
and CO dominating above 550 °C [320] . 

There  is  no  clear  agreement  in  the  literature  as  to  whether 
smouldering  or  ﬂaming  combustion  of  the  same  fuel  produces 
more  particulate  matter,  with  some  ﬁnding  smouldering  gener- 
ates  more  [321] ,  while  others  indicating  ﬂaming  produces  more 
[322-324] . However, it is clear that the particulate emissions from 
smouldering and ﬂaming the same fuel will be different. 

5.2. Links to fuel types 

The emissions from smouldering are most strongly correlated 
to the chemical composition of the fuel. Therefore, the fuel chem- 
istry governs the possible gaseous and condensable thermal degra- 
dation products as well as the extent of ﬁxed carbon remaining 
for combustion, thereby also inﬂuencing combustion temperatures. 
The temperature affects the type of emissions produced but, in the 
case of smouldering, it is secondary to the importance of the fuel’s 
chemical structure. Table 7 catalogues general emission products 
as a function of the starting fuel, relevant process ( Section 2 ), and 
spatial temperature region ( Section 4 ). 

It is beyond the scope of this work to explore the minutia of 
emission formation mechanisms, however, the major compounds 
and trends are summarized. 

Biological  fuels  including  peat,  biomass,  tobacco,  etc.,  are  all 
chemically similar in that they are formed from mixtures of cel- 
lulose, lignin, saccharides, organic acids, proteins, and steroids, as 
well as long chain hydrocarbons in the form of fats or waxes. These 
fuels all contain oxygen bearing molecules, which gives them char- 
acteristically low-temperature pyrolysis products that are relatively 
unique. Many low molecular weight oxygenated groups are evolved 
through pyrolysis of these fuels below 300 °C, thereby creating a 
highly aliphatic char [15 , 319 , 329 , 333 , 344] . Increasing temperatures 
results  in  the  char  becoming  more  aromatic  in  content  and  the 
evolution of gas phase alkanes [15] . 

If temperatures are able to rise above 600 °C, some polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may begin to form and will increase 
in concentration with increasing temperatures [318 , 328 , 334] . PAHs 
can  be  formed  in  the  absence  of  oxygen,  and  can  therefore  be 
considered products of endothermic pyrolysis. However, PAHs have 
also been shown to yield equal or higher concentrations under ox- 
idative conditions and, thus, can also be considered products of in- 
complete combustion [318 , 335] .

Heavy  hydrocarbons  are  capable  of  undergoing  smouldering 
combustion so long as they are suspended in a porous matrix al- 
lowing  adequate  air  ﬂux,  heat  storage,  and  surface  area  for  re- 
action [48 , 50 , 80 , 81 , 152 , 255 , 296] . Smoulderable hydrocarbons are a 
complex mixture of numerous aliphatic and aromatic groups often 
containing oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur impurities. Emissions from 
these combustible materials have not been characterized in detail, 
nevertheless, these fuels have been shown to deliver smouldering 
temperatures that exceed 800 °C with the subsequent potential for 
the production of species more common to gas phase combustion. 
Polyurethane  foam  has  been  extensively  studied  and  shown 
to  thermally  break  down  in  two  steps,  starting  with  the  scis- 
sion  of  the  polyol-isocyante  bond  between  250  and  300 °C 
[110 , 143 , 194 , 343] . Both compounds can further degrade at higher 
temperatures with polyol decomposing to contribute a secondary 
char [343] . Additional details, in particular with respect to agricul- 
tural fuels, are presented in Section 2 . 

5.3. Metals 

Metal  emissions  are  affected  by  metal  content  of  the  com- 
bustible material, fuel bed temperature, and the level of particu- 
late matter control. Metals volatilize in the preheating or smoul- 
dering regions (depending on compound boiling temperature) and 
then recondense in the cooler portions of the fuel bed ahead of the 
front or in the exhaust gas stream. Most metals (except mercury) 
generally recondense/adsorb onto ﬁne particulate in the emissions 
and are removed with those ﬁne particulates. Therefore, an effec- 
tive technique to control the metals emissions in the ﬂue gas is 
to employ an ash removal device. However, due to the instability 
of the mercury compounds in the gaseous form at higher tempera- 
tures, more often above 700 °C, the compounds decompose to form 
elementary mercury. The elementary mercury is not readily solu- 
ble and thus, unlike other heavy metals, is not removed with the 
ash during simple post-combustion ﬂue gas treatments (e.g., with 
wet scrubbing systems). 

Additionally, some ﬂue gas components may react with the dis- 
solved  mercury  compounds  and  release  elementary  mercury.  To 
reduce this effect, additives may be added to scrubbing water or 
the ﬂue gas, which would react with the mercury compounds and 
form  precipitates.  Some  of  the  additives  in  the  market  include 
trimercapto-S-triazine (TMT 15) from Degussa AG and Nalmet A1 
from Nalco Chemie GmbH [345] . 

Different types of emission control systems have been used on 
incinerators. In general, old installations included only electrostatic 
precipitators (ESP) for control of particulates. Some of these instal- 
lations achieved low emissions for some metals. However, ESP may 
be problematic because they can produce dioxins and furans. Many 
installations include a semi-dry scrubber where an alkaline reac- 
tant (e.g., lime) is injected to absorb acid gases. An ESP or a fab- 
ric ﬁlter that removes the particulate matter follows the scrubber. 
In general, the dry scrubber-equipped facilities have shown lower 
heavy metal emissions in the stack gases. 

Flue gas temperature and particulate matter size are major fac- 
tors in controlling heavy metals emissions. The metals and their 
compounds carried by the furnace exhaust ﬂue gas enter the emis- 
sion control system as solids, liquids, and vapours. In the semi-dry 
scrubber, some of the vapours condense to solids or liquids (de- 
pending on the vapour pressure/temperature relationship), which 
are then removed from the ﬂue gas. Based on theoretical vapour 
pressure considerations, it should be possible to remove 99% of the 
heavy metals by lowering the ﬂue gas temperature to below 200 °C 
[346] . 

During smouldering, particulate matter most likely is only emit- 
ted if the reaction front is allowed to progress to the end of the 
reactor; therefore, the metals in the combustible material are ex-

pected to remain primarily in the ash and/or within the pores of 
the inert porous matrix. With the exception of some scenarios in 
surface smouldering, as the energy from combustion is mostly ac- 
cumulated within the reactor, the temperature of the ﬂue gas is 
usually  below  200 °C  [50] .  Furthermore,  controlling  smouldering 
temperatures below 700 °C is possible [56] , thereby avoiding the 
formation of elementary mercury altogether. In this way, all the 
metals should be present in the ash and/or within the porous ma- 
trix. Importantly, this represents a potential source for metals re- 
covery. 

5.4. NOx formation

2 , NO 

NO x  is the general term which encapsulates the seven oxides 
5 ); however, in 
2 O, N 
of nitrogen (NO, NO 
combustion, NO x generally only pertains to the production of NO 
and NO 
2 . Though NO x formation has been extensively studied, par- 
ticularly in the relation to boilers, incinerators, and ﬂuidised bed 
reactors, very little focus has been given to NO x formation during 
smouldering.

There are generally three pathways for NO x  production: Ther- 
mal NO x , Prompt NO x , and Fuel NO x . Prompt NO x forms from at- 
mospheric nitrogen reacting in hydrocarbon-rich ﬂame zones and 
is therefore inapplicable to smouldering combustion and will not 
be discussed further. 

Thermal NO x is formed during the high temperature oxidation 
of  atmospheric nitrogen following the  two-step  Zeldvich  mecha- 
nism [347] . Under the Zeldvich model, Thermal NO x formation is 
highly sensitive to temperature, with NO x formation being signiﬁ- 
cantly reduced at temperatures less than 130 0–160 0 °C [348 , 349] . 
Though it is possible that biomass smouldering may foster peak 
temperatures beyond the onset of Thermal NO x production, these 
temperatures have not been commonly attained with biomass or 
sludge [18 , 56 , 293] and may be more practical with more energetic 
materials like coal tar [50] . Most acceptable operating conditions 
will not exceed 700 °C, thus, self-sustained smouldering propaga- 
tion can be maintained at temperatures below those that result in 
signiﬁcant production of Thermal NO x . 

Many fuels contain a small percentage of organically bound ni- 
trogen, which can contribute signiﬁcantly to the total NO x produc- 
tion. Table 8 shows the typical nitrogen contents within a variety 
of fuels. 

Fuel  nitrogen  is  typically  bound  to  the  fuel  by  C –N  or  H –N 
bonds  which  are  substantially  weaker  than  the  triple  bond  of 
molecular nitrogen [350] . Unsurprisingly, it is easier to break these 
bonds, thus Fuel NO x forms far more readily than Thermal NO x and 
at  relatively  lower  temperatures  relevant  for  smouldering.  Fuel- 
bound nitrogen is the dominant NO x formation pathway account- 
ing for 50% −80% of the NO x in these systems [348 , 351 , 352] . How-

the excess char. Char NO x therefore only accounts for a small por- 
tion of Fuel NO x . Char formation is integral to smouldering com- 
bustion;  the  extent  to  which  its  formation  affects  NO x  yields  is 
likely signiﬁcant but unexplored. 

As  discussed  previously,  there  is  very  limited  research  that 
speciﬁcally explores NO x formation in a smouldering regime. How- 
ever, these limited studies do agree that Volatile NO x accounts for 
the majority of total NO x , with some contribution from Char NO x 
and no Thermal NO x ( Fig. 32 ). 

The early-time peak of NO x in Fig. 32 indicates the formation of 
Volatile NO x from volatile nitrogen species. After all volatiles have 
been emitted, a constant production of NO x from the oxidation of 
char nitrogen occurs until the fuel is completely consumed. 

The spatial variability of smouldering has the potential to affect 
NO x  formation in a number of ways. The chemical and physical 
characteristics of the fuel will evolve throughout time and space as 
smouldering progresses. The fuel will thermally degrade as it un- 
dergoes pyrolysis producing volatiles and char. The characteristics 
of the char can also change with time as the oxidation front ap- 
proaches and temperatures increase. Likewise, the emitted species 
will change in the same space over different times. The formation 
of Volatile NO x and Char NO x from fuel nitrogen will therefore be a 
complicated matter in a smouldering system. For example, it is un- 
clear what effect the abundance of evolved volatiles and tars gen- 
erated from smouldering or the role that the porous media will 
have on the volatile nitrogen and its competition for free oxygen. 
In addition, the spatial temperature distribution and local thermal 
non-equilibrium ahead of the combustion front is much different 
for  smouldering  than  traditional  combustion  systems,  and  could 
have a profound effect on the formation potential of NO x . Similarly, 
the characteristics of the evolving char produced during pyrolysis 
and its effect on Char NO x formation/reduction are unexplored. Fi- 
nally,  fuels  such  as  sludges,  which  have  signiﬁcantly  higher  fuel 
nitrogen  content  and  cannot  be  conventionally  treated  by  incin- 
eration, can be destroyed by smouldering. The effect of this fuel 
stoichiometry on NO x formation has yet to be seen. 

5.5. Summary 

It is important to reiterate that the spatial and temporal evo- 
lution of the smouldering front within the porous bed will deter- 
mine the overall emissions from a reactor. Though it is well es- 
tablished that emissions from smouldering have multiple forma- 
tion pathways, many smouldering experimental studies look at the 
bulk emissions for the global smouldering process and do not dis- 
tinguish how or when they were formed. In contrast, extensive re- 
search has been carried out (primarily via TGA or Pyrolyser) to de- 
termine pyrolytic and oxidative thermal processes for many differ- 
ent chemical species with various reaction mechanisms proposed 
for the detected gaseous emissions. Important physical and chemi- 
cal information can be elucidated from these studies, however, care 
must  be  taken  when  extrapolating  these  results  to  smouldering.

ever, despite the signiﬁcant contribution of fuel nitrogen to the to- 
tal NO x production, only 10% −60% [353] is converted to NO x due 
to competing oxidation and reduction mechanisms. 

Fuel nitrogen has been found to split between volatile species 
and the residual char during thermal degradation; both of which 
can be oxidized to form either Volatile NO x or Char NO x or be re- 
2 . Nitrogen-bearing fuels have also been found to pro- 
duced to N 
duce appreciable levels NH 
3 and HCN during combustion [354 , 355] 
with  the  NH 
3 /NO x  ratio  generally  increasing  as  the  combustion 
reaction  becomes  more  dominated  by  smouldering  than  ﬂaming 
[356] . 

Volatile NO x is generally considered to form through the oxida- 
tion of HCN, NH 
3 , and HNCO volatiles and is typically responsible 
for 60% −80% of the total Fuel NO x [348 , 349 , 351] . Volatile NO x for- 
mation is a homogenous process and is therefore highly dependant 
on contact with free oxygen. Local conditions beyond the combus- 
tion front therefore determine the extent to which volatile nitro- 
gen  is  oxidized  or  reduced.  Smouldering  can  be  controlled  such 
that it operates near a stoichiometric oxidant ﬂux, which would re- 
sult in reducing conditions beyond the combustion front, but typi- 
cally smouldering is sustained with excess air. NO x produced from 
volatile nitrogen can also be reduced by heterogeneous reactions 
with the char. 

The quantity of fuel nitrogen that remains in the char is vari- 
able and depends on the fuel composition as well as the extent 
of heating it experiences [351 , 357] . Studies on the combustion of 
char at single char particle conditions (i.e., approaching the limit 
of zero char mass) have shown that char nitrogen can be oxidized 
to NO with a net conversion of 65–100% [358] . As Char NO x yields 
are  substantially  lower  than  this  in  practice,  the  produced  NO x 
is believed to undergo heterogeneous reduction by reacting with 
other, active char particles, which has been thoroughly reviewed 
by [359] . NO yields as a function of increasing coal char masses is 
shown in Fig. 31 , which clearly demonstrates that as more char is 
in the system, the eﬃciency of the conversion of char nitrogen to 
NO rapidly decreases due to the reduction of NO by reaction with

Smouldering is a dynamic process where temperature and species 
concentrations can vary sharply over very small distances. Further- 
more, heating rates in smouldering are dependant on the gaseous 
ﬂux through the system and can also vary in space and time. Of- 
ten, thermal degradation studies do not mimic the conditions as 
experienced in actual smouldering combustion by using unrepre- 
sentative heating rates and atmospheres [313] . H 
2 , for example, is 
often  a  main  pyrolytic  decomposition  product  found  in  thermal 
degradation studies but is generally negligible in true smoulder- 
ing because most heating rates favour the formation of H 
2 O. While 
it is not possible to generalize the production of different species 
during  smouldering,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  the  nature  of 
the reactions present during smouldering and the temperatures at 
which they occur. The speciﬁc operating conditions will determine 
the species produced and their quantities. There is very little data 
available on the production of different pollutants under the spe- 
ciﬁc conditions of smouldering, thus, it is very important to evalu- 
ate this topic experimentally. 

6. Research gaps and opportunities 

Smouldering combustion is a growing research ﬁeld of critical 
value to society [361] . Innovative experimental and numerical work 
has  brought  our  understanding  of  smouldering  science  to  levels 
where solutions to long-standing ﬁre safety challenges are within 
reach and novel applications to solve a wide range of safety, waste, 
and energy problems are emerging [362–367] . Integrating the ex- 
isting research into a uniﬁed conceptual model and emphasizing 
the key role of local and global energy balances reveals a frame- 
work upon which predictions are realistic and, thus, proactive ma- 
nipulation of complex smouldering systems is possible for produc- 
tive purposes. Moreover, this exercise reveals some remaining re- 
search gaps and opportunities for future research directions; a se- 
lection of these are summarized below. 

Beyond conventional textbook values, the mass transfer coeﬃ- 
cient between solid and gas phases in the porous medium ( h m ) has 
not been studied and its determination still poses complex practi- 
cal problems that have not been resolved. Thus, proper quantiﬁca- 
tion of the mass transfer coeﬃcient ( h m ) remains a limitation to 
all existing mathematical models. 

There exists very little data available on the production of dif- 
ferent pollutants under the speciﬁc conditions of smouldering, thus 
it is very important to evaluate this topic experimentally. More- 
over, emissions control technologies optimized for smouldering ap- 
plications have not received attention but will be critical for up- 
scaling and commercializating smouldering applications. 

By  identifying  the  roles  of  global  and  local  energy  balances 
on the onset of self-sustained smouldering propagation , it becomes 
clear that a much more precise understanding of heat and mass 
transfer processes within porous media is needed. Existing ignition 
criteria presented in Table 4 remain valid for the ignition of self- 
sustained smouldering , nevertheless, these criteria are only relevant 
to self-sustained smouldering propagation if heat and mass transfer 
processes pertaining the global energy balance are properly quan- 
tiﬁed. 

The conceptual model and resulting set of governing equations 
and  assumptions  in  ad-hoc  approaches  to  extinction  that  build 
from  Dosanjh  et  al.  [75] ’s  original  analysis  still  seem  to  exclude 
phenomena that govern the extinction of self-sustained smoulder- 
ing propagation . Therefore, there is still a gap in the literature and 
room for a harmonized explanation of smouldering extinction. 

The limited literature on transition to ﬂaming does not yet al- 
low establishing all the variables involved in this process. Never- 
theless, it is clear that the interplay between global and local en- 
ergy balances determines whether the conditions necessary to shift 
from a heterogeneous to a homogeneous reaction can be attained. 

Characterization of the evolution of the porous media as thermal 
conditions progress towards transition to ﬂaming appears essen- 
tial. Given the importance of this phenomenon for ﬁre safety, this 
is an issue that needs to receive much greater attention. 

It is an open question as to the appropriateness of the existing 
mathematical representations of chemical schemes for the full de- 
scription of all stages of smouldering and the degree of simpliﬁca- 
tion that can be employed while still producing meaningful predic- 
tions. Currently, this question cannot be addressed because mass 
transfer effects between the different phases have not been stud- 
ied in detail. The reaction rates depend on the supply of reactants 
to the reaction zone ( Eq. (19) ) and the reaction occurs in the solid 
phase. Therefore, without detailed quantiﬁcation of mass transfer 
between phases it is not possible to ascertain if the mathematical 
expression and embedded parameters properly quantify the reac- 
tion  rates.  As  a  simple  example,  water  evaporation/condensation 
– which are critical to applications of smouldering destruction of 
high  moisture  content  wastes  – are  currently  treated  as  chemi- 
cal reactions. However, to simulate this process with correct en- 
ergy balance considerations, water evaporation/condensation must 
be integrated as a phase-change process; resolving this challenge 
is a signiﬁcant opportunity, as are many related aspects within this 
sub-discipline. 

In general, there exists a much larger body of information on 
porous  solid  fuels  than  on  condensed  fuels  in  inert  porous  me- 
dia.  Nevertheless,  in  the  context  of  the  former,  effective  means 
of extinguishing large smouldering hazards remains elusive. More- 
over, for the latter, a wide array of thermodynamic parameters re- 
main  to  be  quantiﬁed.  Little  research  exists  on  effectively  man- 
aging combustible wastes with smouldering and the potential to 
thereby recover materials and energy as part of the drive towards 
a fully circular economy. There is substantial opportunity to use 
smouldering to destroy a long list of legacy organic contaminants 
as well as the many emerging contaminants being revealed as ex- 
tensive in the environment. Smouldering applications all share the 
promise  of  providing  well  controlled  engineering  processes  that 
are technically effective while also low energy, low carbon foot- 
print, and therefore more sustainable than alternatives (e.g., incin- 
eration) [361] . However, such research is in its early stages and the 
myriad of potential applications and process optimizations reveals 
a research landscape rich in opportunities.
