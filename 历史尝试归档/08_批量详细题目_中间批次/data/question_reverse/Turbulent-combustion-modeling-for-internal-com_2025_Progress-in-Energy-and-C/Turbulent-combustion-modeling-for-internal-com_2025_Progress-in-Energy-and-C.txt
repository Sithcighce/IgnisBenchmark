The modeling of combustion or, to be exact, turbulent combustion using numerical simulation has become
state-of-the-art in the process of developing internal combustion engines (ICE). Since the combustion regimes
that occur fundamentally differ depending on the combustion concept used, several turbulent combustion
models have been developed to meet the respective requirements. The selection of appropriate combustion
models is crucial to accurately reflect the physical processes, specifically considering the mixing conditions and
the effects of turbulence on the mean reaction rate. This review provides an overview of turbulent combustion
models for use in ICE computational fluid dynamics. After a brief introduction to the basic aspects of ICE
combustion simulation, the underlying governing equations and the required physical background are outlined.
Next, the relevant turbulent combustion models for ICE application and their mathematical formulations are
aggregated to enable the discussion of relevant model parameters and characteristics. A comprehensive review
of application cases with respect to ICE technologies, namely spark ignition and compression ignition, is given.
Furthermore, recent advances and future prospects in terms of the integration of future fuels, the enhancement
of turbulent combustion models to meet future engine technologies and the use of machine learning techniques
to advance turbulent combustion simulation in the context of ICE are discussed.

1.  Introduction

The importance of the internal combustion engine (ICE) in the last
150 years seems to be the most obvious when the words ‘engineering’
and ‘engineer’ are examined. The ICE stands out as an innovation that
revolutionized mobility, pushed forward industry and had a significant
influence (directly or indirectly) on the economy in the 20th century.
Consequently, research on combustion engines was as topical in the
last century as artificial intelligence is today. However, looking on at
mobility, the use of electric vehicles for short and medium distances
will  reduce  the  number  of  cars  powered  by  ICEs  in  the  next  few
decades. Even though, ICEs will still play an important role [1] as they
will still be used in transportation of goods [2], shipping [3] and power
generation  [4]  in  remote  areas.  In  this  context,  further  research  on
the development of ICEs remains important and ongoing. To comply
with emission legislation and to decrease the carbon footprint of ICEs
(which  is  essential  in  order  to  meet  global  climate  targets  such  as
‘‘Paris 2015’’), the current and future focus is on measures including the
use of alternative fuels and advanced combustion concepts with high
compression ratios and lean mixtures [5–12], require very significant
effort for their control and engine part design [1].

Supported by detailed experiments, simulation plays a significant
role in research and development of engines [13]. In addition to well-
established zero-dimensional (0D) simulation models, the increase in
computational power in recent decades has paved the way for three-
dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. The
application  of  3D  CFD  simulations  in  ICE  research  is  versatile  and
includes combustion investigations, gas exchange simulations, injection

analysis,  fluid–structure  interactions  and  the  analysis  of  engine  part
stresses, water jacket optimization, among others. As the title suggests,
this  review  focuses  on  the  simulation  of  the  combustion  process  of
ICEs  using  CFD  simulation.  The  simulation  of  engine  combustion  is
generally a very difficult task. High levels of turbulence, a complex
moving domain and non-trivial mixture processes close to the flame
front are examples of the complexity of transient combustion inside
ICEs [14]. Since the development of combustion models is often driven
by research groups focusing not on engine combustion but rather on
low pressure combustion applications such as thermal turbomachiner-
ies, the use of combustion models ‘‘off the rack’’ for CFD simulation
of  ICEs  should  be  treated  with  caution.  Although  the  topic  of  tur-
bulent  combustion  modeling  for  ICEs  has  been  addressed  in  several
well-known review articles [15–18], this paper picks-up the topic to
emphasize  its  relevance  and  furthermore  to  provide  added  value  to
the  ICE  scientific  and  technological  communities.  To  this  end,  the
key  targets  of  the  authors  are  to  (i)  give  an  overview  of  state-of-
the-art  turbulent  combustion  models  for  ICE  application,  (ii)  review
and critically assess recent works and application examples, and (iii)
give  an  outlook  on  future  prospects.  The  aim  is  to  reach  a  broad
range of the ICE-related community from junior engineers seeking a
comprehensive overview of the topic to experts interested in what has
been  achieved  since  the  last  reviews  were  published  and  where  the
journey will take the topic in the future. To fulfill these requirements,
the present article is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview
of  the  general  ICE  combustion  concepts  and  the  resulting  demands
on turbulent combustion modeling. Section 3 presents the governing
equations  for  the  simulation  of  reacting  flows  and  summarizes  the
principles of chemical reaction modeling and the different regimes that

2.  Basic aspects of ICE combustion simulation

The following section provides an overview of common ICE combus-
tion concepts, focusing on the specific modeling requirements for their
accurate simulation. A classification in terms of the ignition concept is
chosen which enables a systematic overview due to its simplicity. Fig. 1
shows a schematic illustration of the covered ICE concepts. More details
on the relevant flame regime of each combustion concept are found in
Section 3.3.

2.1.  Spark-ignition engines

In general, a distinction can be made between homogeneous and
stratified charged spark-ignition (SI) engines. Although the ideal mixing
of  all  reactants  inside  an  ICE  is  generally  not  possible,  being  the
lean  turbocharged  SI  engines  operating  with  admixture  upstream  of
compressor the closest situation, the assumption of a perfect homoge-
neous charge is essentially acceptable for engines with external mixture
formation and, under special conditions, for engines with very early
direct injection. The charge is assumed to be spatially homogeneous in
the combustion chamber at ignition. In contrast to stoichiometrically
operated engine, which was the first choice in concepts for SI engines
when  operated  with  three-way  catalyst,  in  most  of  the  applications
modern concepts prefer lean or stoichiometric but highly diluted with
exhaust gas mixtures to decrease fuel consumption, being the second
compatible  with  the  three-way  catalyst  mandatory  in  some  cases  to
comply with emission standards as in passenger car applications. As
implied  by  the  term,  the  main  characteristic  of  SI  engines  is  that
the combustion process under normal conditions is initiated by single
or  multiple  local  energy  sources.  These  energy  sources  are  usually
provided  by  an  electric  arc  between  the  electrodes  of  a  spark  plug,
but unconventional methods such as laser ignition are also feasible.
If  the  energy  source  releases  enough  energy  within  or  close  to  an
ignitable  mixture,  combustion  is  initiated.  The  flame  kernel,  which
is  initially  laminar,  undergoes  progressive  wrinkling,  leading  to  its
transformation into a turbulent flame, a process known as the laminar-
to-turbulent  flame  transition.  Since  the  resulting  thin  flame  front  is
highly influenced by the turbulent flow in the cylinder, the combustion
duration greatly depends on the existing in-cylinder flow conditions.
Therefore, adequate modeling of flame propagation requires substantial
knowledge of the flow conditions in the cylinder and especially of the
flow around the ignition source. The modeling process becomes even
more  complex  due  to  the  turbulence-chemistry  interaction  (TCI).  It
is necessary to distinguish between large eddies which solely wrinkle
the  flame  front  and  eddies  in  the  scale  of  the  flame  front  which
influence  the  combustion  process  on  a  microscale  level.  Ideally,  a
turbulent combustion model that is applied to SI combustion takes into
account the TCI on both levels (macro- and microscale) or is based on
meaningful modeling assumptions. In general, ignition and initial flame
kernel development are one very important aspect to model and predict
cycle-to-cylce variations (CCV). Additionally, the choice of the correct
turbulence modeling approach, using LES for CCV, is another aspect
that has to be considered. Especially at conditions when the air/fuel
ratio reaches flammability limits, the prediction of CCV and emissions
are key challenges.

In the case of direct injection SI engines, the homogeneity of the
mixture is directly dependent on the fuel injection timing, increasing
the stratification as it is shifted towards the compression stroke. This
stratification results in higher spatial deviations in the air/fuel ratio as
the mixture becomes more stratified. In standard operation, a nearly
stoichiometric mixture is desirable at the spark plug at ignition time to
promote stable and fast flame kernel development in the early phase
of  the  combustion  process,  while  in  some  particular  conditions  this

mixture  can  be  locally  enriched  as  it  is  the  case  of  catalyst  light-
off strategies. As the flame propagates in the combustion chamber, it
reaches  zones  with  both  rich  and  lean  mixtures,  which  significantly
influence the local flame speed. Since the flame speed at stoichiometric
conditions is higher than in rich and lean mixture zones, a nose-shaped
flame is generated [19]. A secondary diffusion flame arises from the
mixing of lean and rich zone residuals behind the flame front. Thus,
the turbulent combustion model has to handle combustion regimes with
substantially different demands on turbulence combustion interaction.
Furthermore,  since  the  flame  propagation  is  influenced  by  the  local
mixture composition and turbulence intensity, the correct prediction
of stratification in the combustion chamber is highly important. This
requires accurate modeling of the fuel spray and its interaction with
the turbulent flow field in the cylinder and the combustion chamber
walls.  As  the  combustion  process  is  highly  affected  by  the  charge
stratification  and  the  in-cylinder  flow  field,  these  quantities  greatly
influence CCV and pollutant formation, so they must therefore be pre-
cisely determined using numerical simulation. Due to the combustion
of locally rich mixtures in direct injection SI, the formation of particle
emissions in addition to other gaseous emissions plays an important
role,  thus  requiring  appropriate  models  to  accurately  predict  these
emission components.

Another  factor  which  shows  the  importance  of  determining  the
correct  flame  propagation  is  the  time  at  which  the  flame  hits  the
combustion chamber walls since combustion can only occur if the flame
propagates through a flammable mixture in the cylinder. As modern SI
engines are increasingly operated at conditions which promote abnor-
mal combustion events such as pre-ignition or knocking combustion,
the modeling of these events is becoming more important.

For the sake of completeness, the concept of turbulent jet ignition
(TJI) through the use of prechamber combustion deserves a mention at
this point. This concept is based on the ignition of a flammable mixture
in a smaller volume (as compared to the main combustion chamber).
The  flame  front  propagates  through  the  prechamber  and  forces  hot
products and active radicals to flow into the main combustion chamber
via overflow bores. This leads to a more accelerated combustion in the
main chamber than with conventional spark ignition since there are
multiple ignition locations. It is obvious that this combustion concept
is a very challenging task for numerical simulation. Based on the design
of the system, i.e., active or passive, the prechamber can be treated as
if it is similar to a homogeneous SI or direct injection SI subsystem by

adopting the aforementioned simulation demands. However, the main
combustion chamber filled with homogeneous mixture can be modeled
by models that take into account the ignition of the mixture by the
prechamber ejected jets, and the later combustion development from
the inside to the outside of these jets. Since the prechamber combustion
process is highly influenced by the scavenging process, especially in the
case of passive prechambers, the simulation of the flow prior to ignition
is vital to combustion prediction.

2.2.  Compression-ignition engines

As  the  name  suggests,  compression  ignition  (CI)  engines  do  not
require an additional energy source to trigger the combustion process
as is the case for SI engines. Combustion is initiated by a combination
of the state in the combustion chamber and the flammability of the fuel.
The most common CI engine technology is non-premixed CI, usually
known as diesel engine, which is characterized by a direct injection of
the fuel into highly compressed air in the cylinder. In addition to the in-
cylinder flow conditions prior to injection, which are commonly driven
by swirl motion, predicting the injection and mixing processes with suf-
ficient accuracy is particularly critical and mandatory to obtain reliable
results from turbulent combustion simulation. Especially the accurate
modeling of droplet dynamics, jet breakup and fuel evaporation are
highly complex and require appropriate submodels. Furthermore, the
requirements  in  terms  of  spatial  and  temporal  discretization  during
injection  in  the  jet  domain  have  a  comprehensive  influence  on  the
computational time and accuracy. As the stratification of the charge in
the combustion chamber yields local deviations between rich and lean
mixtures, the formation of particle emissions such as soot in rich re-
gions and NOx in lean regions are of major interest in terms of emission
prediction. Due to the low sensitivity of mixture-driven combustion to
variability in local conditions, the CCV caused by combustion are of
minor interest.

In response to the need to reduce NOx emission, low temperature
combustion (LTC) concepts have been developed. One popular example
of this family of combustion concepts is the homogeneous charge com-
pression ignition (HCCI) concept [20,21]. HCCI is based on autoignition
of a homogeneous mixture as a result of the temperature rise in the
cylinder during the compression stroke. Since temperature distribution
highly influences the autoignition process, accurate prediction of the
flow thermochemical conditions prior to combustion is indispensable.

Furthermore, modeling of the underlying chemistry in order to accu-
rately predict autoignition and thus the start of combustion is essential
to  the  development  of  combustion  concepts  for  stable  operation.  A
similar  combustion  concept  that  also  includes  fuel-rich  mixtures  is
partially premixed compression ignition (PPCI) [22]. The main differ-
ence between HCCI and PPCI is that the charge distribution for PPCI
is  more  heterogeneous  at  ignition  compared  to  HCCI.  Another  LTC
concept is premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) [23]. Unlike
HCCI, which is based on early formation of a homogeneous mixture,
PCCI is similar to non-premixed CI with the difference that the fuel is
injected earlier in the compression stroke, which enables more moder-
ate mixing times. The low temperature is achieved with considerable
use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). As PCCI combines direct fuel
injection and autoignition, the simulation demands mentioned for non-
premixed CI in terms of injection and mixing as well as for HCCI in
terms of chemistry modeling hold true for this concept. Even though
one of the main aims of LTC is to reduce NOx and soot, the modeling
of  these  emissions  is  still  relevant  but  not  as  critical  as  with  other
combustion concepts. Yet since one of the main challenges in applying
these  combustion  concepts  is  ignition  control,  the  investigation  of
cyclic variations is of great interest. To achieve improved control of
the combustion process while retaining the nature of LTC, reactivity
controlled compression ignition (RCCI) was introduced [24]. In general,
RCCI is similar to HCCI as it is based on a homogeneous mixture that
undergoes a temperature increase during the compression stroke, but
instead of increasing the temperature until autoignition conditions of
the fuel are reached, the temperature is kept below the autoignition
level  and  ignition  is  initiated  by  injection  of  a  high-reactivity  fuel.
Thus,  ignition  timing  can  be  controlled  to  a  certain  extent  by  the
injection process while the temperature of the charge is kept at low
levels.  However,  the  use  of  two  separate  fuels  requires  a  specific
model that can handle the different chemistry. Furthermore, the fuel
injection, mixing and ignition processes indicate similar demands as
in the aforementioned injection-based combustion concepts. Another
concept is the thermally stratified compression ignition (TSCI) concept
which is based on direct injection of water or water-fuel mixtures to
force a thermal stratification which leads to staggered autoignition and
consequently to reduced peak heat release rates. Since the efficiency of
the TSCI concept is based on the evaporating cooling of the injected
water, its accurate prediction is crucial for analysis using numerical
simulation.  To  complete  the  overview  of  combustion  concepts  and
modeling demands, dual fuel (DF) combustion has to be mentioned.
Although DF combustion cannot be directly classified as CI, nor does
it fit in the category of SI engines, this paper treats it as part of the CI
class with the awareness that this classification is not strict. DF in the
sense of combustion technology describes the use of at least two fuels to
power combustion whereas one fuel is used to ignite the remaining fuel
components (e.g., pilot diesel injection for natural gas engines), which
introduces higher energy for charge ignition compared to spark plugs
and thus yields more stable engine operation with the drawback of a
potential increase in emissions [25,26]. The demands for modeling DF
combustion are comprehensive since fuel injection, mixing and ignition
have to be covered in a secondary flammable charge. Thus, modeling
concepts should be able to cope with different combustion regimes as
well as the chemistry of more than one fuel. The accurate determination
of emissions with DF concepts is critical and should therefore be part
of numerical simulation.

3.  Governing equations and physical background

The  following  section  presents  an  overview  of  the  basic  set  of
conservation equations required to calculate reacting flows. It also pro-
vides insight into the physics of flame fronts and the major properties
of combustion regimes, namely premixed, non-premixed and partially
premixed, and their occurrence in internal combustion engines.

3.1.  Flow equations

Numerical simulation of fluid mechanics is based on solving partial
differential equations (PDE) in a certain spatial and temporal domain.
The equations mathematically express the conservation of mass, mo-
mentum (Navier–Stokes equations) and energy. Any consideration of
reactive flows must take into account the conservation of species. For
a detailed derivation of the following equations, the authors refer to
standard fluid mechanics or combustion theory books (Batchelor [27],
Becker [28], Williams [29]). The governing equations are:

not possible, the Hirschfelder and Curtiss approximation [30] is
widely used as the best first-order approximate solution of (5)

An important characteristic number which links the thermal and
mass diffusivities was introduced in form of the species Lewis number:

Lek =

(8)

where cp is the constant pressure specific heat and Dk is the molecular
diffusivity of species k. The assumption of a species Lek which is equal
to the global Le is commonly made due to similar cp and Dk across
the species if the molecular weight is similar. Furthermore, it is com-
monly assumed to have unity Le, which corresponds to equal thermal
and mass diffusivities. This assumption holds true for the majority of
practical combustion systems except for hydrogen combustion where
Le is lower than unity.

Poinsot and Veynante highlighted the differences between equations

of reacting and non-reacting flows [31]:

• A  reacting  gas  is  a  non-isothermal  mixture  of  multiple  species

which must be tracked individually.

• Thermodynamic data are more complex because heat capacities

change significantly with temperature and composition.

• Specific modeling of the chemical reactions for the species are

required.

• Transport coefficients require specific attention because the gas is

a mixture of gases.

For the specific application of these equations on reacting flow in

internal combustion engines, note the following:

• In addition to temperature and composition, pressure has a signif-
icant influence on chemical reactions and thermodynamic prop-
erties.

3.2.  Turbulence modeling

The following section provides a brief introduction to the strategies
for modeling turbulence. The three fundamentally different approaches
in literature greatly differ in their numerical requirements: On the one
extreme, there are Reynolds-average Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations
which only solve for averaged flow quantities. Turbulent fluctuations
are modeled purely by either algebraic or transport equations. Thus, the
requirements for spatial and temporal resolution are rather low. On the
other end, direct numerical simulations (DNS) do not use any model
for  turbulence.  Since  all  relevant  time  and  length  scales  have  to  be
resolved, extremely fine grids and small time steps are required. Thus,
this  method  is  not  realistically  applicable  to  real-world  engineering
problems in everyday CFD. In between these two extremes, large eddy
simulations (LES) resolve the large turbulence structures and require
a sub-grid model for small-scale turbulent fluctuations. They apply a
spatial filter to the flow quantities.

3.2.1.  DNS

One approach to account for turbulence in CFD is to avoid the use of
any turbulence modeling at all and to resolve the turbulent structures
from the Kolmogorov length scale up to the integral length scale of the
domain directly. In addition to the spatial discretization of the problem,
the temporal treatment requires time steps small enough to ensure that
information travels through only a fraction of the grid spacing during
one time step to fulfill the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition
C o < C oc rit. The high demands on resolving all turbulent structures in
time and space consequently lead to computational costs which are not
feasible for everyday simulation (number of operations  ̃Re3, minimum
of Re11∕4 [32]). Nevertheless, DNS contributes considerably to a better
understanding  of  turbulent  combustion  as  well  as  the  improvement

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101200

of combustion and heat transfer models used in RANS or LES. Pitsch
and Trisjono [33,34] give a comprehensive overview of the systematic
methodology of the development of a DNS-based turbulent combustion
model. The increase in computational power in the past few decades,
which has nearly hit a wall due to physical constraints, also enables
the use of DNS in applications that have more practical relevance as
shown by the ETH combustion research group [35–37]. However, these
studies focus on investigating wall heat transfer during the compression
phase and do not resolve combustion. Jafargholi [38] performed DNS
of  a  cylindrical,  engine-like  domain  to  investigate  the  effects  of  the
initial turbulent field on the flame, and the interaction of the flame
with  cold  walls.  DNS  of  TJI  systems  can  be  found  in  the  works  of
Qin et al. [39] and Benkos et al. [40,41]. These works use 2D DNS
configurations to investigate the full ignition and flame propagation
process of methane/air combustion. Although the simulations enable
detailed analysis of the flame structure based on highly resolved data,
the limitations of using 2D to investigate the 3D effect of turbulence as
well as the use of a highly-reduced mechanism raises the issue of the
cost-benefit ratio of applying DNS in this context.

3.2.2.  RANS

As the name of this computational approach for describing turbulent
flows suggests, the main idea of the RANS technique is to split the all
instantaneous quantities z into mean and fluctuating components as
z = ̄z + z′ with z′ = 0

(9)

In  variable  density  flow  typically  met  with  combustion  a  density-
weighted of Favre decomposition

z = ̃z + z′′ with ̃z =

ρz
̄ρ

and ̃z′′ = 0

(10)

is generally preferred over the Reynolds decomposition (9), as it avoids
closure of non-linear terms involving the fluctuating density ρ′.

Nevertheless, Favre averaging also leads to unclosed terms in the
governing equations. The resulting unclosed term in the momentum
equation ̄ρ ̃u′′
is referred to as Reynolds stresses. In the field of ICE
i u′′
j
combustion modeling the most extended approach consists of using the
Boussinesq approximation based on the introduction of an artificial tur-
bulent viscosity μt , the term is reduced to one single variable, which can
be expressed by several model approaches ranging from zero-equation
(e.g., Prandtl [42]) to one-equation (e.g., Spalart and Allmaras [43])
to commonly used two-equation models (e.g., k − ε model by Jones
and Launder [44]). Another type of turbulence model directly computes
the Reynolds stress tensor (e.g., Launder et al. [45]) which requires
the solution of six additional transport equations for all independent
components of the Reynolds stress tensor. The turbulent viscosity μt ,
the  turbulent  Schmidt  number  for  a  specific  species S ck t ,  and  the
turbulent  Prandtl  number P rt are  used  to  close  the  turbulent  fluxes
of momentum, species and temperature (enthalpy), respectively, where
μt is estimated by one of the aforementioned turbulence models. Since
the macroscopic effects of the laminar diffusion fluxes can generally be
ignored, assuming sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, the remaining
term,  which  needs  modeling,  is  the  mean  species  chemical  reaction
rate ̇ωk.  The  goal  of  turbulent  combustion  models  is  the  closure  of
this  unknown  component;  this  is  the  content  of  the  model  review
in Section 4. RANS-based simulations have been widely used in the
field of internal combustion engine research and development in the
past (and the authors believe that they will remain important). Since
the  computational  effort  can  be  kept  within  reasonable  limits,  it  is
advisable to employ it as a tool for predicting cycle-averaged quantities.
Nevertheless, it is worth recalling some fundamental aspects behind
the  RANS  turbulence  modeling.  The  isotropic  nature  of  turbulence
assumed by most RANS modeling neglects significant features of the
turbulent flow which affect all flow-dependent physical effects. Mixture
formation in particular is mainly driven by turbulent convection and its
underlying vortical structures. Furthermore, the interaction of the flame
front  with  the  turbulent  flow  decisively  influences  the  combustion

development, so the proper selection of the RANS turbulence model
according  to  the  characteristics  of  the  flow  is  a  necessary  (but  not
sufficient) condition to model accurately the combustion process.

3.2.3.  LES

The basic idea behind the LES simulation approach is to distinguish
between  large  turbulent  structures  that  are  simulated  directly  while
small  scale  structures  are  being  modeled.  To  differentiate  between
small and large scale eddies, the variables are filtered by special LES fil-
ters. Typically, implicit filtering in which the high frequency filtering is
achieved by the volume averaging in finite volume discretization [46]
is used in ICE simulation. Similar to the previously shown Favre av-
eraging, mass-weighted filtering can be introduced to obtain a Favre
filtered representation ⟨z⟩ of any arbitrary variable z defined as
⟨z⟩ =

where the hat superscript denotes the convolution with a spatial filter
kernel  (
over the computational domain , generally written
as
̂z (x, t) = ∫
Again, the Favre filtered balance equations contain unresolved terms
which require modeling approaches. For instance, the subgrid stress
tensor ̂ρ (
in  the  Favre  filtered  momentum  equation
are  handled  by  a  subgrid  turbulence  model  such  as  the  Smagorin-
sky subgrid-scale model [47] or the dynamic structure models [48].
Rutland [16] provides a comprehensive and still valid review of LES
turbulence models for application in internal combustion engine sim-
ulations. Similar to the aforementioned turbulence treatment with the
RANS method, the filtered species chemical reaction rate ̂̇ωk requires
modeling by turbulent combustion models.

(12)

Since  the  mesh  of  internal  combustion  engine  LES  changes  with
the movement of the piston, time-dependent filter widths are required
in the applied filter approach. Non-uniform filter widths lead to time
commutation errors which involve constraints on the filter kernel to
minimize  these  errors  (e.g.  Leonard  et  al.  [49]).  Although  Moureau
et al. [50] come to the conclusion that the time commutation error
can be ignored if the flow field and the mesh generation are induced
by the same boundary movement, time commutation errors can occur
with adaptive mesh refinement approaches. LES generally requires high
grid resolutions since the filtering process is strongly influenced by the
mesh. The higher sensitivity to numerical diffusion than with RANS
resulting from less turbulent viscosity places higher demands on the
numerical  scheme.  Thus,  LES  usually  requires  at  least  second  order
central schemes to avoid artificial dissipation.

LES enables a glimpse into a new world which might go unseen by
RANS simulations. Since the large turbulent vortices, which play a ma-
jor role in mixture formation and combustion, are calculated without
any modeling assumptions or determination of anisotropy, the results
gained with LES are closer to those in the real world. Furthermore, a
much more detailed analysis is also possible of, e.g., design variations
and  the  resulting  flow  and  consequently  engine  performance  [16].
While  RANS  provides  an  ensemble-averaged  solution  which  corre-
sponds to a mean engine cycle (which does not need to correlate with
a real single engine cycle), LES gives results of single engine cycles.
Therefore,  a  major  application  field  of  LES  in  engine  simulation  is
the investigation of CCV. In addition to the simulation of consecutive
cycles, methods to run cycles in parallel have been introduced by pro-
viding just one initial cycle and producing new cycles by inducing small
perturbations in the initial field, which significantly reduce simulation
time [51,52]. The individual cycle results obtained by LES require the
simulation of a certain number of cycles in order to obtain the statistical
reliability required to formulate general statements on engine behavior,
especially if non-stable operating conditions with considerable CCV are
being investigated.

Although it can be assumed that computational power will continue
to grow, the general use of DNS for turbulent combustion modeling
is  not  on  the  horizon  except  for  fundamental  research  in  academic
fields.  The  importance  of  LES  turbulence  modeling  is  progressively
increasing, especially for the analysis of cyclic variations and detailed
investigations  of  physical  effects.  However,  LES  also  involves  some
unresolved or partly resolved issues such as the subgrid-sale modeling
of the near-wall motion in wall-bounded flows and non-trivial mesh
influence [53]. Therefore, RANS will still play a considerable role in
future engine CFD since the computational effort is less than with LES
and results can be obtained much faster. Even if future LES computation
costs are comparable to current RANS costs, the increased computa-
tional power will permit the execution of a larger number of RANS
simulations, which are expected to be still of great interest in those
problems requiring massive number of runs such as engine hardware
and settings co-optimization studies.

3.3.  Combustion regimes

The basis for modeling turbulent combustion is knowledge of the
present combustion regime. Before focusing on characterizing combus-
tion especially in internal combustion engines, a brief introduction into
the fundamentals of physical analysis of regimes in premixed and non-
premixed turbulent combustion is given. As proposed by Peters [54]
equal diffusivities are assumed for all reactive scalars and temperature
leading  to  unity  Schmidt  and  Lewis  numbers, S c = ν∕D =  1 and
Le = am∕D =  1, respectively, which is useful for relating the small-
est diffusive scales of species mass transport to those of momentum.
The  underlying  turbulent  flow  field  is  usually  characterized  by  the
turbulence Reynolds number representing the ratio between turbulent
convective transport and viscous forces

Re =

u′lt
ν

(13)

with the root mean squared (RMS) velocity fluctuations u′, the turbu-
lence integral length scale lt , and the flow kinematic viscosity ν. The
relation between the chemical reaction time scale and the transport
(turbulent) time scale is represented by the Damköhler number:

D a =

τt
τc

(14)

The Damköhler number can be used to describe the interaction of the
flame with the turbulent flow. If it is high (D a  ≫ 1), the chemical
time is shorter than compared to the transport time leading to a thin
chemical  reaction  zone  which  is  deformed  and  transported  by  the
flow field, while the inner flame structure essentially remains laminar
(the laminar flame elements are generally referred to as ‘flamelets’).
A long chemical time indicates a slow chemical reaction and thus a
low Damköhler number (D a ≪ 1). In this case, the reactants are mixed
by the flow before they react, in a process known as perfectly stirred
reactor. As the chemical time in most technical applications and thus
internal combustion engines is shorter than the transport time [55], this
review does not consider cases with a low Damköhler number, which
are dealt with applying Taylor’s expansion on the Arrhenius laws [55].

3.3.1.  Premixed turbulent combustion

Premixed combustion refers to when In premixed combustion, the
fuel  and  oxidizer  are  completely  mixed  before  they  react.  A  wide
range of internal combustion engine concepts (e.g., SI engines) rely on
premixing the fuel and air before they enter the combustion chamber.
The temperature must remain low enough to keep the mixture in a
metastable state to prevent undesired pre-ignition. The combustion is
initiated, either by a heat source (e.g., spark), which raises locally the
temperature  beyond  a  fuel-dependent  crossover  level  [54,56]  or  by
increasing pressure and thus temperature until appropriate conditions
for self-ignition are reached.

For characterizing the influence of turbulence in the inner reaction
zone and its close proximity, it is useful to relate the smallest scales of

S. Posch et al.

turbulence to the flame scales, as represented by the turbulent Karlovitz
number

length scale lk has been obtained here by expressing the Kolmogorov
time  scale  as tk = l2

recalling the assumption of unity Schmidt number.

k∕ν and  the  chemical  time  scale  as tc = δ2

Since the dimensionless numbers Re, D a and K a are related as

Re = D a2K a2

(16)

resulting in the requirement of a set of two parameter to describe the
premixed combustion regimes is basically determined by a set of two
parameters.

Peters  [57]  introduced  a  second  Karlovitz  number  to  enable  a
further distinction of regimes at Karlovitz number greater than unity.
In  this  region,  the  flame  is  thickened  by  turbulent  motions  but  the
reaction zone (reaction zone thickness δr ) is not affected. The reaction
zone-based Karlovitz number is:

K aδ =

( δr
lk

)2

=

( δr

(17)

with  the  ratio  of  the  reaction  zone  to  the  laminar  flame  thickness
lying between δr ∕δl = 0.1 at atmospheric pressure and 0.03 at higher
pressures [54].

The dimensionless numbers enable the definition of the following
premixed turbulent combustion regimes illustrated in the logarithmic
diagram shown in Fig. 2 [54,55]:

• Re = 1: Separation of laminar and all turbulent flame regimes.
• K a  < 1 and u′∕sL < 1:  The  interactions  between  turbulence
and combustion are limited resulting in a predominantly laminar
propagation. In this regime the velocity of the large eddies u′ is
too small to affect the flame front, which propagates with sL. This
regime is called a wrinkled flame regime.

• K a  < 1 and u′∕sL > 1: The corrugated flame regime is charac-
terized  by  a  flame  which  can  be  affected  by  larger  structures
of  the  turbulent  flow  resulting  in  pockets  in  the  flame  front.
Furthermore, turbulent flame speed is comprehensively increased
by turbulence.

• K a > 1 and K aδ < 1: Turbulent flame regimes beyond the Klimov-
Williams criterion (K a > 1) are characterized by a large influence
of turbulent flow structures on the inner flame structure. How-
ever, small eddies are still larger than the reaction zone which
remains  thin  close  to  a  laminar  reaction  zone.  This  regime  is
called a thin reaction zone.

• K aδ > 1: In the broken reaction zone, turbulent motions have a
major impact on the preheat and reaction zone, resulting in the
absence of a laminar flame structure.

Similar or revised diagrams have been proposed by Borghi [58],

Abdel-Gayed et al. [59], Poinsot et al. [60] or Roberts et al. [61].

3.3.2.  Non-premixed turbulent combustion

In many applications, the combustion reactants are not provided
in  a  mixed  state  but  supplied  separately.  The  fuel  and  oxidizer  in
non-premixed combustion are simultaneously mixed and burnt in the
combustion  chamber.  Convection  processes  at  the  macroscale  level
together  with  diffusion  processes  on  a  molecular  basis  enable  the
reactants, which were initially spatially separated, to reach each other
in the vicinity of the flame front, which is the reason this is also called
a diffusion flame. A typical example of non-premixed combustion is
the diesel engine, in which fuel is injected into compressed air and
vaporizes resulting in autoignition that initiates combustion. Although
the mechanisms involved in turbulent premixed combustion also play a

Borghi  [58]  and  modified  by  Peters  [54].  The  reaction  zone-based  unity  Karlovitz
number K aδ corresponds to K a = 100 with δr ∕δl = 0.1.

role in turbulent non-premixed combustion, the paramterization of the
latter is much more difficult. The definition of a characteristic length
scale, which could be described by a characteristic velocity scale as the
laminar flame speed in turbulent premixed combustion, is not possible
here. As alternative, a diffusion thickness

is introduced, dependent on the local strain rate α and the diffusion
coefficient Dst Using the mixture fraction gradient |∇Z|st , Peters [54]
transferred the length scale ld from the physical space into an equiv-
alent diffusion thickness in the mixture fraction space, (ΔZ)F , defined
as

(ΔZ)F = |∇Z|st ld

(19)

Upon substitution of the scalar dissipation rate χst is defined as

(ΔZ)F by definition also includes the diffusion layers surrounding the
reaction zone. The latter is represented in mixture fraction space by a
corresponding reaction zone thickness (∇Z)R defined as
(ΔZ)R = ζ (ΔZ)F

(22)

where the factor ζ < 1 essentially depends on the ratio χst∕χq, with χq
being the scalar dissipation rate at flame extinction.

The  different  non-premixed  combustion  regimes  can  be  distin-
guished  by  relating (∇Z)F and (∇Z)R to  the  RMS  of  the  mixture

Different non-premixed combustion diagrams based on Damköhler
number or scalar dissipation rate are found in the literature (Borghi
[62], Libby and Williams [63], Poinsot et al. [31]).

The  aforementioned  approach  of  using  combustion  diagrams  to
identify  combustion  regimes  in  internal  combustion  engines  should
be applied with caution. In internal combustion engines the turbulent
flow is generally far from being homogeneous and isotropic, which is
typically assumed in the combustion regime definitions. Thus, regime
characterization  using  these  diagrams  only  gives  a  fairly  rough  dis-
tinction. Nevertheless, this is very useful for the choice of turbulent
combustion  model  and  the  analysis  of  simulation  results.  Therefore,
several studies apply combustion regime diagrams to characterize and
investigate ICE combustion [64–67].

Fig. 4 shows three flame categories and their combinations that are
of particular interest in numerical simulation of turbulent combustion
in the ICE: turbulent premixed flames, turbulent non-premixed flames
or  diffusion  flames,  and  homogeneous  combustion  [19].  Since  the
assignment of an engine combustion process to the aforementioned cat-
egories is not straightforward and there is no guarantee that available
combustion concepts are covered, the following descriptions are based
on general considerations. Homogeneous SI engines usually meet the
criterion of turbulent premixed combustion expressed by small values
of K a, whereas direct injection diesel or CI engines fall under turbulent
non-premixed  flames  since  the  mixing  time  scales  are  dominant  for
the overall combustion process [19]. As indicated by their name, HCCI
engines are characterized by homogeneous combustion, which is com-
pletely governed by chemical kinetics without any flame propagation
due to volumetric combustion in the combustion chamber [68]. In the
case of direct injection SI engines, there are three distinct zones due
to the stratified charge and the spark induced ignition. The flame front
traveling through the combustion chamber reaches both lean and rich
premixed zones. In addition, a non-premixed flame develops behind the

premixed flame, resulting in three different flame types at the leading
edge of the flame referred to as the triple point [19,69]. DF combustion
can be seen as one of the most complex combustion processes since all
of the three flame categories may be involved, especially if knock-limits
are reached [18]. The final category is TJI using prechamber concepts.
Depending on the prechamber ignition system (passive or active) or the
scavenging concept (gas or mixture scavenged), different flame types
may occur in the prechamber and the main combustion chamber. Thus,
different combustion modeling strategies might be applied to simulate
the prechamber and the main combustion chamber. Table 1 gives an
overview of the different combustion concepts.

4.  Turbulent combustion modeling

In  addition  to  presenting  the  underlying  physics  and  turbulence
solving  strategies,  this  paper  reviews  turbulent  combustion  models
most relevant for the application in numerical combustion simulation
of  internal  combustion  engines.  This  section  lists  the  most  common
models, explaining their modeling approaches and remarking on their
applicability. This list is not exhaustive; the methods presented here
are  the  most  commonly  used  combustion  models. Table  2 provides
an  overview  of  the  common  turbulent  combustion  models  for  ICE
simulation, their range of validity, capability, emission treatment and
turbulence model handling.

4.1.  Flamelet concept

Before listing the most common for numerical combustion simula-
tion of internal combustion engines, the flamelet concept is addressed.
A majority of the turbulent combustion models described below assume
that the flame front can be described by a laminar flame on a local
scale regardless of the combustion regime [71]. In terms of premixed
turbulent combustion, the flamelet concept holds true for regions with
a shorter chemical time than the transport time described by a high
D a. Furthermore, the flamelet assumption requires a coherent flame
front, which is ensured by K a  < 1, although it seems to stay valid
while K aδ < 1 and the flame reaction zone remains unaltered. These
regions can be identified in the lower right zone of the regime diagram
in Fig. 2 which is commonly represented in homogeneous charge SI
engine  combustion  conditions.  Recent  studies  have  focused  on  the
question of whether the flamelet concept is valid for a wider range of
turbulent conditions. Kheirkhah and Gülder [72] reviewed numerous
research  articles  dealing  with  experimental  investigations  and  DNS
studies of premixed turbulent flames. They furthermore discussed the

implications of the flamelet and non-flamelet behaviors on how fast
turbulent premixed flames burn. Based on their analysis, an updated
turbulent premixed flame regime diagram was proposed in which the
thin reaction zone was divided into a thin preheat and thin reaction
zone and a broadened preheat and unknown thin or thick reaction zone.
The authors recommend introducing a third dimension to the regime
diagram to take into account the distribution of the rotational kinetic
energy between different eddy sizes, and they proposed future research
directions to gain more insight into flamelet/non-flamelet behavior. Li-
patnikov et al. [73] analyzed DNS data of turbulent premixed flames at
various K a to directly assess the capabilities of the flamelet approach.
Based on their findings, they concluded that the domain of the flamelet
concept validity is wider than initially assumed, which is also in line
with other studies [74,75]. The theoretical foundation for the validity
of the flamelet concept validity was robustly established through the
derivation of a strong stretch theory in the flamelet generated manifold

(FGM) formalism by van Oijen et al. [76]. The authors addressed nu-
merous DNS studies that approved the accuracy of their approach. The
flamelet concept is also applied to non-premixed turbulent combustion
by assuming that the chemical reactions in the flame front occur in
thin layers which can be viewed as local laminar reaction sheets [77].
Since  the  mixing  process  is  assumed  to  be  the  dominant  factor  in
non-premixed turbulent combustion, the flamelets are represented in
terms of the mixture fraction of fuel and oxidizers, leading to a one-
dimensional mathematical description. Thus, the combustion chemistry
is treated separately from the turbulent flow.

4.2.  Characteristic time-scale models

There are multiple models which are based on a ratio of charac-
teristic flow, turbulence and chemistry time scales. The simplest is the
eddy break-up model (EBU), which ignores chemical kinetics effects

11

S. Posch et al.

and reduces the reaction rate to a characteristic turbulent mixing time.
Extensions  of  the  EBU,  such  as  the  eddy-dissipation  concept  or  the
partially stirred reactor model, include chemical kinetics in the form
of finite rate chemistry, and the reaction rates are scaled by a ratio of
characteristic time scales.

The EBU was initially developed by Spalding [78–80] and was later
modified by Magnussen and Hjertager [81] to form the eddy dissipation
model (EDM). The idea behind this concept is to model the combustion
rate  by  an  appropriate  break-up  rate  of  unburned  mixture  zones  to
ensure that mixture and hot gases react. This concept is applicable at
high Reynolds numbers Re ≫ 1 and high Damköhler numbers D a ≫
1 [31].

The EBU model defines the mean reaction rate as a function of either
the fuel mass fraction YF or the progress variable c and a characteristic
turbulent mixing time τE B U :
√

̄̇ωF = CE B U ̄ρ

or ̄̇ω = CE B U ̄ρ

̃c′′2
τE B U
where CE B U is a model constant and the ′′ superscript denotes fluctu-
ations in the respective quantity. The following derivation is based on
the progress variable c but is also valid for the fuel mass fraction YF .
Generally, the k − ε turbulence model is used with the eddy break up
closure, allowing the calculation of the characteristic turbulent mixing
time as:

(24)

k
ε

τE B U =
To estimate the fluctuations in the progress variable, the assumption of
an infinitely thin flame leads to:
̄ρ ̃c′′2 = ρ (c − ̃c)2 = ̄ρ

( ̃c2 − ̃c2)

≈ ̄ρ ̃c (1 − ̃c)

(25)

(26)

The  latter  approximation  basically  assumes  a  two-delta  probability
density  function  (PDF)  distribution  of  unburnt  and  fully  burnt  mix-
ture [55]. Accordingly, the EBU model finally defines the mean reaction
rate as
̄̇ω = CE B U ̄ρ
Involving  only  known  mean  quantities  without  additional  transport
equations, this model is intriguingly simple and often used in commer-
cial CFD codes.

A modification of the EBU model was introduced by Magnussen and
Hjertager [81] by replacing the mass fraction variance in Eq. (24) by
the minimum of the deficient species (fuel for lean or oxygen for rich
mixtures) yielding the eddy dissipation model.

The  partially-stirred  reactor  (PaSR)  model  is  an  extension  of  the
EDM model. It assumes that each cell can be split into a reactive part
and a non-reactive part, also called the fine structures and surround-
ings, respectively [82,83]. The reasoning behind this approach is that
reactions mainly take place in regions with high turbulence, associated
with a fast mixing rate, which effectively limits the reactions to only a
fraction of the domain. The PaSR model assumes that combustion in the
fine structures is a sequential process where chemical reactions happen
after mixing. The mean source term ̇ωi for species i is then:

̇ωi = ψ

)

̃ρ (Y ∗

(28)

̃ρ is the density, Yi are the species mass fractions and ∗ and 0 super-
scripts denote the reactive and non-reactive structures, respectively. τ∗
represents the residence time in the reactive structures. The factor ψ
(sometimes also γ), which is the fraction of the reactive part, is most
commonly  modeled  by  the  ratio  of  chemical  and  mixing/turbulence
time scales:

ψ =

τc
τc + τmix

(29)

A general approach to determine the chemical time scale is to use the
slowest one [84,85]:

τc = max

The mixing time scale is related to turbulence quantities. It is modeled
as a certain fraction of the integral time scale:

τmix = Cmix

k
ε

(31)

where Cmix is a model constant in the range of 0.001–0.3.

While recognizing the benefits of mathematical simplicity and low
computational  costs,  the  EBU  model  has  important  limitations.  The
model  tends  to  overestimate  the  reaction  rate,  especially  in  highly
strained regions, where the ε∕k ratio is large [55]. Furthermore, the de-
termination of the characteristic time τE B U can be difficult in practical
simulations as discussed by Poinsot and Veynante [31]. From the nature
of the turbulent time scale definition, a nonphysical prediction of the
burning  velocity  in  near-wall  regions  can  be  observed.  Adaptations
by predicting the characteristic time scale in terms of turbulent and
laminar time scales help to resolve this issue [86].

4.3.  Coherent flame model

A very common geometric description of the turbulent flame front
is based on the flame surface area or rather the flame surface density
Σ. The mean burning rate of a species i can be written as [55,87]:

̇ω = ρu ̄sf Σ

(32)

where ̄sf is  the  mean  flame  consumption  speed  along  the  surface.
As such, this ansatz basically separates the complex chemical kinetics
introduced  through  the  flame  speed ̄sf from  turbulence/combustion
interactions represented by Σ. Therefore, the modeling of flame surface
density Σ is  crucial  for  capturing  appropriately  the  impact  of  the
turbulent  motion  which  advects,  diffuses,  stretches  and  strains  the
flame. Under flamelet assumption the flame surface density is generally
defined as
Σ (c∗)

≈ |∇Z| = Σ
where the gradients of the progress variable c refer to premixed com-
bustion  and  the  gradients  of  the  mixture  fraction Z refer  to  non-
premixed combustion.

According  to  the  fundamental  definition  of  Marble  and  Broad-
well [88] revised by Candel and Poinsot [89], the evolution equation
of the flame surface density in a turbulent field is given by:
∂ Σ
ε
∂ t

This formulation uses a gradient assumption to express the turbulent
flux of flame surface density incorporating the turbulent viscosity νt and
a flame surface turbulent Schmidt number S ct. Since the flow induced
strain rate represented by αf ε∕k is generally positive [31] last sink term
is introduced on rhs of (34) to avoid infinite growth of the flame surface
area.

In  other  more  elaborate  CFM  based  approaches,  the  expression
of  the  turbulent  fluctuation  strain  rate  was  further  modified  by  an
efficiency  function ΓK .  The  DNS  data  fitted  function ΓK was  intro-
duced to represent the intermittent turbulent net flame stretch (ITNFS)
model [90].

The model parameters for the source and consumption terms, like
αf and βf in Eq. (34), have to be selected carefully. The consumption
term parameter βf is generally set to unity, the strain rate factor αf is
also assumed in the range of unity. Settings far away from unity may
significantly deteriorate the predictions.

The CFM approach has been meanwhile extended in various work
to tackle also more challenging real engine flame conditions. Among
these, Colin et al. [91] proposed an extension to multi-component fuels
as well as an adapted knock model known as the extended coherent
flame model (ECFM).

Another enhancement of the modeling framework was introduced
by Colin and Benkenida [92] for non-premixed combustion in diesel
application. The authors proposed the existence of three distinct zones

Thus, the kinematic condition for G reads

(u + sLn)

+ u ⋅ ∇G = sL |∇G|

∂ G
∂ t
with the normal vector n = −∇G∕ |∇G|, it reads
∂ G
∂ t
Due to the appearance of the burning velocity sL, this equation is only
well-defined at the flame front, and the G field is not unique outside
the flame front. To overcome this issue numerically, the G field is often
re-normalized to represent a signed distance function, i.e., |∇G| = 1.

Difficulties in implementing the G equation arise due to the assump-
tion of an infinitely thin flame front, which leads to instabilities and the
formation of cusps. The turbulent flame speed sL has to be modeled as
well. sL depends on the thermodynamic state, mixture composition and
curvature and stretch of the flame front [31]:
sL = sL(p, T , xi, κ , )
where κ is the curvature and  is the stretch of the flame front. The G
equation can be applied to turbulent combustion, as long as the flame
front remains sufficiently thin compared to the turbulent (length) scale
(Kolmogorov scale). Thus, the burning velocity remains well-defined.
This condition is met when K a < 1 and the entire flame structure is
smaller than the smallest turbulent scales. For the thin reaction zone,
where K a  > 1 but K aδ < 1, the smallest turbulent eddies alter the
preheat zone, but are still too large to change the inner reaction zone.
Analogously to the iso-surface G(x, t)  = G0 for identifying the flame
front position, Peters [54] identified the inner thin reaction zone by an
iso-temperature T (x, t) = T0. Introducing the displacement velocity of
iso-temperature surface as flame speed sL in G-equation leads to

It should be noted that the equality of the two iso-surfaces indepen-
dent of the thermodynamic state of the unburned mixture is assumed,
although  inhomogeneous  mixture  or  temperature  differences  of  the
unburned gas would lead to different T0 iso-surfaces for the flame front.

4.5.  Thickened flame model

A  general  problem  in  large-eddy  simulation  of  combustion  is  to
represent  flame  front  propagation  on  meshes  which  are  commonly
coarser than the real flame front thickness. To resolve this issue, Butler
and  O’Rourke  [94]  proposed  to  thicken  the  flame  artificially  while
preserving the laminar flame speed as shown in Fig. 6. Colin et al. [95]
presented a general formalism for use in LES that provides the basis for
the following model description.

A sufficiently lagre scaling factor is introduced to increase in the
flame thickness from δL to F δL, so that the flame can be resolved by
LES mesh. However, as the wrinkling of the flame by unresolved eddies
smaller than F δL needs to be accounted for, an efficiency function E
is  introduced  as  well  to  capture  this  subgrid-scale  effect.  Using  the
thickened  flame  approach  in  the  filtered  transport  equations  of  the
reactive scalars the Favre-filtered representation of the species equation
(Eq. (4)) becomes
∂ ̂ρ⟨Yk⟩
∂ t
(

∂
∂ xi
where Dk denotes the molecular diffusivity of the species k. While the
last term must on rhs be provided by the subgrid-scale model for the
turbulent fluxes, the filtered reaction rate is computed directly using the
Arrhenius-type laws as in DNS. This is a major advantage of the method
because phenomena such as ignition or flame/wall interactions do not
require submodeling [31].

(see Fig. 5) in a computational cell, namely the unmixed fuel zone,
the mixed zone and the unmixed air zone creating the 3-zone ECFM
(ECFM3Z). In this model, the state of the gases mixture is defined in
the 2D space of the mixture fraction Z and the progress variable ̃c.
For the description of mixing, the three zones can be represented in
terms of the PDF of Z using a delta function for each zone. Due to
the conservation of mass through the flame front which is assumed as
infinitely thin, the progress variable was defined as

̃c = 1 −

̃Y u
F u
̃YT F u
where ̃Y u
F u is the mass fraction of fuel present in the fresh gases and
̃YT F u is the pseudo mass fraction of fuel before the onset of combustion.
To apply the ECFM model to the mixed zone, a formalism to determine
the properties in the fresh and burned gas state was presented which
enables the precise calculation of the laminar flames speed. For the
model to be used with diesel engines, an autoignition model such as
the tabulated kinetics of ignition (TKI) model [93] is required.

(35)

4.4. G-equation

A geometry-based premixed combustion model related to the flame
surface density model is the level set approach or G-equation model.
This method circumvents the closure problem of the reactive source
terms by introducing a non-reacting scalar G. The following derivation
of the G-equation model essentially follows the formalism of Peters [54,
57]  who  made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  development  of  the
approach.

When the inner flame structure is not affected by turbulence, i.e. the
flame front is thinner than the Kolmogorov length scale, the flame front
can be described by an infinitely thin sheet which separates unburned
and burned gas. The introduction of a scalar function G to track the
flame front is then possible, where the flame front x = xf is described
by:

G = G0
The evolution of G0 is governed by the condition

Two major approaches have been introduced to determine the PDF:
one that presumes the shape of the PDF and one that solves a PDF
balance equation.

Presumed  PDF. The  basic  idea  of  the  presumed  PDF  approach  is  to
determine the PDF function in terms of one or two parameters, usually
the first and second moments of the random variables. Another widely
used related approach is to presume the shape of the PDF with a given
analytical function, for example the β-function [31]:

In  Legier  et  al.  [96],  a  sensor ΩT F is  introduced  to  determine
whether the flame should be thickened or not. ΩT F can be expressed
by:

ΩT F = ⟨Y ⟩

where YF and YO denote  the  mass  fractions  and νF and νO are  the
molar stoichiometric coefficients of fuel and oxidizer, respectively. The
parameter Γ artificially decreases the activation temperature (Γ  < 1).
Using this concept, the scaling factor F is computed from
Ω
Ωmax

)
(Fmax − 1

(

(45)

where ξ is  a  parameter  to  control  the  thickness  of  the  transition
between  thickened  and  non-thickened  zones. Ωmax is  the  maximum
value of Ω, which can be calculated analytically for a stoichiometric
premixed flame. Applying this formalism to non-premixed combustion
is known as the dynamically thickened flame (DTFLES) model.

With increasingly thickened flame zones for higher scaling factor
F and efficiency function E, diffusion becomes increasingly important
and the scalar transport equation can become dominated by diffusion.
As shown by Kuenne et al. [97], with a coarser computational grid,
where both F and E increase, the diffusion number may exceed the
Courant number, which affects the stability restrictions on the maxi-
mum possible time step. Furthermore, as shown by Misdariis et al. [98],
the model constant β has to be adjusted to the numerical scheme. In
general, it should be emphasized that the artificially thickened flames
still carry considerable unresolved content, which restricts thickened
flame model (TFM) to applications where precise modeling of flame
characteristics, such as emissions and strain effects, is not essential.

TFM is also well applicable to non-premixed combustion. This was
recently shown in a study by Cuenot et al. [99]. However, the con-
cept was only tested for laminar steady strained flames. In the out-
look, the authors call for future work to describe the sub-grid scale
flame-turbulence interaction.

4.6.  PDF models

In contrast to flame geometry-based combustion models, probability
density function (PDF) models focus solely on the statistical properties
of the intermediate state within the flame front [55].

The general idea behind the method is to find a PDF ̄P of a random
variable Y ∗ at  a  given  time t and  location x,  which  represents  the
probability per unit Y ∗ of the event Y ∗ = Y [100], or, equivalently,
where ̄P (Y ∗)d Y ∗ is the probability of the event Y ∗ ≤ Y  < Y ∗ + d Y ∗.
Usually considering more than one variable in the description of the
N , T ∗; x, t)
flame front, PDF ̄P (Y ∗
is used. Knowing the local joint

The β-function PDF either has a Gaussian-type shape or appears like the
sum of two Dirac delta functions. One general, easily derived limitation
of this approach is that the probability of finding burned mixture in
the premixed case vanishes and thus a β-function PDF is not suitable.
A similar statement holds for the probability of finding burned fuel in
a non-premixed case. A comparison and an overview of presumed PDF
models are found in Huang and Lipatnikov [101].

PDF  balance  equation.
Instead  of  the  assumption  of  an  analytically
determined shape possibly leading to inconsistencies or unphysical pre-
dictions, a transport equation for the PDF supported with the Navier–
Stokes  equations  can  be  introduced.  In  particular,  as  proposed  by
Pope [100], the balance equation for the PDF of the mixture fraction
Z can be written as follows:

Looking  at  Eq. (50),  the  following  terms  appear:  convection  by  the
(I) conditional velocity (using an eddy viscosity model for closure of
the turbulent fluctuating component,) the (I I) chemical source, and
(I I I) molecular mixing. While the chemical source term appears here
in closed form, several works dealing with closure of the molecular
mixing have been developed and can be found in literature [100,102–
104]. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to numerically solve the PDF
equations  with  a  Lagrangian  formulation  of  the  PDF  equation  that
introduces a set of stochastic particles to describe the flame progress.
To enable the practical use of these methods in existing, grid-based CFD
codes, hybrid Lagrangian particle/Eulerian mesh (LPEM) methods have
been introduced [105].

A  comprehensive  review  of  PDF  methods  for  turbulent  reacting
flows was given by Haworth [106] which is one of the standard refer-
ences on this topic in addition to the early contributions of Pope [100,
107].

4.7.  Conditional moment closure

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101200

The conditional moment closure (CMC) model introduced by Kli-
menko [108] and Bilger [109] is related to the PDF methods. Yet in
contrast to it, the CMC method only considers conditional moments
to describe certain states between fuel and oxidizer (non-premixed),
or fresh gas and fully burned gas (premixed). Different from flamelet
models which basically compute the flame surface statistics and the
laminar reactive diffusive structure dependent on the normal spatial
distance respect to the flame surface, the CMC computes conditional
moments at a fixed point in space and time on the mixture fraction. In
non-premixed combustion the mean species mass fractions ̃Yi and the
first conditional moments ρYi|Z = Z∗ are related as
̄ρ ̃Yi = ∫

ρYi|Z = Z∗ ̄P (Z∗; x, t) d Z∗

as  well  as  the
According  to  [55],  the  molecular  diffusion  term EQi
turbulent fluctuation term EYi
can be neglected. Looking on the right
side of Eq. (53), three unclosed terms appear. In general, the condi-
tional velocity is replaced by the Favre mean velocity. As shown by
Swaminathan and Bilger [111], the closing of the reaction term through
the use of a Taylor expansion for the conditional mean temperature for
the Arrhenius-based reaction rate constants leads to higher moments
which are assumed to be negligible giving a first-order closure. The con-
ditional scalar dissipation rate is modeled using a presumed β-shaped
PDF.

The choice of using the mixture fraction as the conditioning scalar
for non-premixed combustion clearly indicates the link to the flamelet
concept [54]. While the first moment CMC equations are identical to
the flamelet equation (Eq. (55)) in the case of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence, Swaminathan and Bilger [111] pointed out that the phys-
ical  meaning  of  these  two  equations  is  substantially  different.  The
main differences are the local character of the flamelet approach in
contrast  to  the  semi-global  CMC,  the  lack  of  necessary  assumptions
regarding the flame topology, and the ability of the CMC to account
for convective fluxes in all three directions at inhomogeneous flows
whereas the flamelet approach only accounts for the convective flux
in  the  normal  direction  to  the  stoichiometric  surface.  However,  as
concluded by Peters [54], since the different derivation of both models
leads to the same equations, the essential underlying assumptions must
be the same and the same physics is captured. Klimenko [112] gave
an  overview  on  the  relation  between  CMC  and  unsteady  flamelets.
In general, the CMC approach is computational demanding since the
number of additional balance equations that has to be solved is given
by  the  number  of  species  times  the  number  of  conditioning  values.
One way to reduce the computational expenses in practical applications
such as ICE simulations, is to reduce the dimension of the CMC domain,
which yields a 2D CMC grid in a 3D CFD case. This can be justified by
the homogeneity along cross-stream directions [110]. A comprehensive
review  of  CMC  for  turbulent  combustion  is  found  in  the  review  of
Klimenko and Bilger [110].

4.8.  Flamelet based models

As already discussed in Section 4.1, flames characterized by shorter
chemical time scales than transport time scales enables modeling in
terms of an ensemble of local laminar flamelets [113]. This assumption
also holds for non-premixed combustion if the chemical reactions occur
in a reaction zone which is thinner than a Kolmogorov eddy [54]. The
local  one-dimensional  (1D)  flamelets  are  modeled  dependent  on  the
mixture fraction Z, which represents the ratio between fuel and total
mass flow rate.

The dependence on the mixture fraction Z implies, that the com-
bustion is essentially governed by the mixing of fuel and oxidizer [19].
Furthermore, the representation of the flame by local flamelets allows
for a separation of the 3D turbulent flow field from the one-dimensional
reaction/diffusion process in the laminar flame. Thus, the results of the
1D flamelet calculation can be generated independently of the turbulent
flow field simulation, which is usually a pre-processing step, where the
results  are  stored  in  look-up  tables.  The  laminmar  flamelet  solution
are  generally  determined  assuming  a  structure  similar  to  a  laminar
stagnation point flame (planar opposed jet configuration) as shown in
Fig. 7.

+ ̇ωk

∂2Yk
∂ Z2

Under  the  assumption  that Z is  a  conserved  scalar  and Le of
unity, the spatial 1D mass conservation equation for each species k is
expressed in Z-space as follows:
∂ Yk
∂ t
where χ denotes the scalar dissipation rate and ̇ωk denotes the reaction
rate of species k. As such, this formulation represents a one-dimensional
reaction/diffusion equation in the most simple form. Since all scalar
quantities (i.e., Z) are moved by the same convective transport, no
convection term has to be considered. Furthermore, the scalar dissi-
pation rate χ represents the only variable which directly includes flow
field quantities and thus acts as the link between the turbulent flow
and chemistry [19]. To couple the 3D turbulent flow field simulation
with the predefined flamelet results, transport equations for the mean
and second moment of the mixture fraction Z can be deployed. The
probability of the presence of a certain flamelet in a computational cell
is determined by a predefined β-function PDF. Since the instantaneous
scalar dissipation rate cannot be directly calculated from the turbulent
flow field quantities and requires additionally modeling, a log-normal
PDF is usually used to calculate the probability of χ. Having determined
both local PDFs of Z and χ the laminar flamelet solution are mapped
into the physical 3D space with the integral

PZ (Z; x, t) ⋅ Pχ (χ; x, t) ⋅ Yk (Z , χ , p, T ) ⋅ d χ d Z

This concept is generally applied to RANS as well as LES turbulence
modeling. A distinction is made in the determination of the first mo-
ment of χ in terms of the turbulent kinetic energy characteristic as well
as the modeling of the mixture fraction variance.

To  lower  the  computational  expense  when  mapping  the  flamelet
solutions into the fluid flow simulation, some approaches proposed to
represent the chemistry with a reduced number of variables (e.g., In-
trinsic Low Dimensional Manifold (ILDM) [114], FGM [115] or Un-
steady/Tabulated Flamelet Progress Variable [116]). In the FGM ap-
proach, the high-dimensional thermal state space of reacting chemical
species can be approximated by a low-dimensional manifold. The corre-
sponding set of laminar flamelet solutions is pre-computed and usually
stored as a look-up table which is coupled with the flow solver via the
control parameters representing the dimensions of the reduced mani-
fold. FGM provides a good balance between computational efficiency
and the ability to accurately capture TCI.

Another concept of coupling the flamelet equations with flow field
simulation is the Representative Interactive Flamelet (RIF) model. In-
stead of pre-processing the flamelet solutions and integrating via look-
up tables, RIF interactively solves the 1d flamelets using the required
statistical averaged quantities, which represent the instantaneous local
flow conditions. The advantage of this method is the dependency of the
transient flamelet evolution on the history of the scalar dissipation rate
χ [117].

proaches.

5.  Application to ICE

This section provides an extract of published application examples
of turbulent combustion modeling for internal combustion engines. In

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101200

Section 2 the application examples are first classified in terms of the
engine working principle namely SI and CI engines, and then by the
type of turbulent combustion model. The goals are to give insight into
the evolution of the individual models and to point out the limitations
as well as the benefits described in representative studies. An overview
of  recent  application  examples  is  given  in  tabulated  form  for  each
subsection. At this point, the authors would like to stress the fact that
limitations and application failures hardly are ever published. Thus,
the statements regarding them are mainly based on the evaluation of
reported  results  and  findings  based  on  the  respective  model  theory.
Furthermore, the focus is on determining the in-cylinder pressure and
heat release rates since the validation with experimental data is valid
while other simulation output quantities such as emission levels do not
allow any useful validation.

5.1.  Spark-ignition engines

5.1.1.  Characteristic time-scale model

Since  rudimentary  characteristic  time-scale  modeling  approaches
such as EBU is no longer the state-of-the-art due to the reported restric-
tions, cf. 4.2, and the availability of adequate computational resources,
the following application examples are solely based on the PaSR model.
Gharehghani et al. [118] performed numerical simulation of a natural
gas  SI  engine  enriched  with  hydrogen.  The  authors  set  the  model
constant Cmix between 0.01 and 0.1 to determine the mixing time scale
(Eq. (31)) but no detailed information regarding the operating point
dependence of this model parameter is given. The GRI-Mech 3.0 [119]
was adopted to consider the chemistry of the natural gas/hydrogen mix-
tures. A comparison of the simulated and measured in-cylinder pressure
with 0% and 30% added hydrogen showed satisfactory agreement. An
LES PaSR application on a homogeneous fueled SI engine was carried
out  by  Wang  et  al.  [120]  to  investigate  different  fuel  combinations
of CH4/H2/CO2. A phenomenological model was introduced to deter-
mine τmix. The model includes inter alia the subgrid turbulent energy
dissipation  rate  and  the  fractal  dimension  of  the  turbulent  field.  To
complete the chemical reaction modeling, a reduced four-step chemical
kinetic mechanism according to Boudier [121] was used which ensures
efficient computation. The comparison of experimental and simulation
results in terms of in-cylinder pressure indicate overall good agreement,
yet small differences occur in the late combustion phase, leading the
authors to argue that the reduced reaction mechanism is insufficient
for capturing the overall combustion characteristic. However, the vali-
dation of the simulation against mean experimental data was based on
one single cycle per investigated fuel composition which is questionable
for LES investigations. Zhang et al. [122] applied the same simulation
approach to investigate CH4/CO2 fuel combinations with the previously
mentioned phenomenological model for τmix but a reduced two step
chemical kinetic mechanism according to Bibrzycki and Poinsot [123].
Bartolucci et al. [124] showed the application of the PaSR approach for
numerical simulation of a partially stratified charge natural gas engine
by using a reduced methane reaction mechanism according to Lu and
Law [125]. The simulation procedure was validated against experimen-
tal data of several combinations of equivalence ratios at homogeneous
or partially stratified charge conditions. Overall good agreement was
achieved in terms of in-cylinder pressure and integrated heat release
while  the  PaSR  model  parameter  remained  constant.  Unfortunately,
the authors did not provide any information regarding the parameter
values.

While the PaSR model provide an affordable treatment of finite-rate
chemistry, the determination of the chemical and mixing time scales is
of great importance. Due to the use of the turbulent properties k and ε
in the definition of the mixing time scale, special wall treatment could
be considered to avoid nonphysical values of the reaction rate. Further-
more, appropriate reduced reaction mechanism should be selected with
regard to accuracy and computational effort. Table 3 gives an overview
of characteristic time-scale model SI application examples.

5.1.2.  Coherent flame model

The application of the CFM to homogeneous SI engines dates back
to the early 90 s as researchers at the Institut Français du Pétrole imple-
mented the appropriate framework into the 3D CFD code KIVA-II and
proved the capability of the model [126]. Based on this work, Duclos
et al. [127] introduced a stretch correction to take into account the
flame-wall interaction as well as conditional averaging of scalar prop-
erties to enable NO and CO determination. The authors also discussed
the influence of the CFM constants which might be used for tuning the
simulation to match experimental results. They advised cautious use
of the constants, which is also valid for all further developments of the
CFM class and current engine simulation applications. The development
of the ECFM by Colin et al. [91] enabled the application of the coherent
flame framework to stratified charge engines and thus also to direct
injection  SI  engines.  A  recent  example  found  in  Maio  et  al.  [128],
who applied the ECFM in combination with the imposed stretch spark
ignition model (ISSIM) [129] to investigate flame propagation in a 3D
RANS simulation framework of a H2 engine for heavy-duty applications.
As  the  results  indicate,  the  presented  modeling  strategy  is  able  to
determine  experimental  tendencies  well.  However,  the  authors  also
addressed  the  calibration  of  the  turbulent  strain  source  term α0 to
match the measured in-cylinder pressure. In this specific H2 application
case, α0 had to be adjusted as a function of the air-fuel equivalence ratio
λ while it generally can be kept constant for gasoline engines as stated
by  the  authors.  This  is  explained  by  the  variation  in  the  Markstein
length  and  thus  by  the  influence  of  differential  diffusion  which  is
not represented in the ECFM turbulent flame speed. Furthermore, the
study covers the integration of chemical kinetics into the determination
of autoignition delay as well as laminar flame speed. Several kinetic
mechanisms were compared and validated against experimental data
from the literature. This procedure is essential to acquire a broad under-
standing of the underlying chemistry and to achieve reliable simulation
results. Benajes et al. [67] applied the ECFM in a computational study
of a TJI gasoline engine operating at lean conditions with a passive
prechamber. With regard to turbulent combustion modeling, the work
contains the TKI model [93] for autoignition and an additional look-up
table for laminar flame speed, the ISSIM [129] and a comprehensive
analysis of the limitations of the model when applied to lean conditions
operating with the TJI concept. The authors reported that the flamelet
assumption might not be valid for the investigated operation at lean
conditions (see Fig. 9) and the simulation is not able to reproduce flame
quenching in the prechamber orifice, which would lead to a shorter
main chamber ignition delay. However, the authors stated that the ad-
justment of the ECFM model constants can help to correct this situation.
An illustrative and recent example of an ECFM-LES application is found
in the study of Benoit et al. [130]. This work deals with the analysis
of cycle-to-cycle variability of a direct injection SI engine under lean
burn conditions. Similar to the other works, ignition is modeled with
the ISSIM ignition model [129]. The authors provided a comprehensive
overview  of  the  fundamental  flamelet  calculation  for  high  dilution
in terms of laminar flame speed and Markstein length. Furthermore,
they noted the need to calibrate the model constant α0 as a function
of the air-fuel equivalence ratio λ to meet the measured in-cylinder
pressure. In line with the aforementioned study, the authors observe
the  transition  of  the  flame  characteristic  to  non-flamelet  conditions

(K a  > 1) as λ increases, yet it is not possible to completely exclude
an overestimation of laminar flame speed. Iafrate et al. [131] applied
the ECFM to investigate H2-enhanced combustion in ultra-lean gasoline
SI engines. The authors derived an expression for the determination
of  the  laminar  flame  speed  for H2-enhanced  gasoline  based  on  the
mechanism of Bounaceur et al. [132]. Furthermore, the TKI model [93]
was  implemented  to  account  for  autoignition  and  the  ISSIM  [129]
was used for ignition modeling. By comparing the reaction rate of the
premixed flame and the autoignition, it was possible to investigate the
influence of H2 admixture on the knock behavior. A further example
of using ECFM for knock investigations is found in the work of Robert
et al. [133]. By applying the ECFM-LES framework, the spark ignition
model ISSIM [129], and the TKI [93] for autoignition modeling, 15
cycles of a homogeneous SI engine were simulated. Two independent
progress variables were used to describe the autoignition and flame
propagation as proposed by the authors in a previous work [134]. The
simulated  in-cylinder  pressure  traces  agreed  well  with  experimental
data  in  terms  of  pressure  level  and  knock  occurrence.  Furthermore,
the  LES  predicted  correct  levels  of  maximum  knock  intensities,  and
captures the knock intensity increase as the spark timing decreases.

The ECFM has proven effective in modeling turbulent combustion
for various engine types, including homogeneous and stratified charge
SI engines. Its capability to integrate chemical kinetics for autoigni-
tion  delay  and  laminar  flame  speed  determination  allows  for  accu-
rate  predictions  aligned  with  experimental  tendencies.  Furthermore,
as highlighted by Colin et al. [135], the species tracer formulation in
the original ECFM formulation can lead to non-zero progress variable
values before the combustion starts in stratified cases followed by a
false start of combustion. This can be avoided by considering in the
auto-ignition model. In general, the model requires careful calibration
of constants, particularly the turbulent strain source term α0. A notable
limitation  is  the  model’s  potential  inability  to  represent  differential
diffusion effects required for H2 combustion. Coherent flame model SI
application examples are listed in Table 4.

5.1.3. G-equation

Two proponents of the G-equation model for flame propagation de-
termination are the research group of Prof. Peters (and later Prof. Pitsch)
at RWTH Aachen and of Prof. Reitz at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison, which have laid the foundation for its use in ICE simulation.
Dekana and Peters [147] applied a G-equation-based combustion model
on  a  direct  injection  SI  engine.  Both  laminar  and  turbulent  flame
speed  were  modeled  using  a  semi-empirical  approach  whereby  the
laminar flame speed was modeled according to Göttgens et al. [148]
and the model constants for the turbulent flame velocity were deter-
mined from DNS-based data from literature [149,150]. The G variance
transport equation was applied to account for the interaction between
the turbulent flow field and chemistry and a β-PDF RIF was applied
to incorporate chemistry. The authors’ comparison of the simulation
results with experimental data for two different λ values yielded good
agreement except in the late combustion phase due to overestimation
of the local turbulent flame velocities in near wall regions. Liang and
Reitz [151] similarly applied this method to investigate a homogeneous
charge propane SI engine as well as a stratified charge gasoline engine.
The turbulent flame velocity was modeled with a semi-empirical model
according  to  Peters  [54]  and  the  laminar  flame  speed  was  deter-
mined based on an adapted version of the correlation of Metghalchi
et al. [142]. An extended form of the G variance transport equation
which contains the velocity of the moving vertex was implemented.
Ignition was simulated with the discrete particle ignition kernel (DPIK)
model [152]. The emphasis was on treatment of primary and post-flame
heat release as well as endgas-autoignition. Chemistry was integrated
directly with a 100-species propane mechanism and a 21-species isooc-
tane mechanism for gasoline combustion. The authors reported good
agreement  between  simulation  and  experimental  results  in  terms  of
in-cylinder  pressure  for  both  engines.  Kim  et  al.  [153]  showed  the
application of G-equation combustion modeling for a TJI system of a
natural gas engine. Based on the standard model formulation described
in Section 4.4, the authors adopted the Ewald and Peters [154] tur-
bulent  flame  speed  formulation  and  a  look-up  table  generated  with
a 46-species skeletal mechanism to determine laminar flame speed. A
step-wise thermal energy input in a spherical volume in the electrode
gap  was  implemented  to  mimic  ignition.  The  authors  validated  the
simulation results with experimental data by splitting the combustion
phase into four sections. The results indicated that a good match was

achieved  in  the  early  combustion  phase  before  MFB50  but  that  the
combustion duration was overestimated after MFB50. This was due to
the model inaccuracy at near-wall regions but as mentioned above may
also be a result of the transition of the flow regime to non-flamelet
conditions. However, an additional comparison with direct chemistry
integration and thus ignoring TCI, showed that the results based on
G-equation  combustion  model  yield  more  accurate  results  especially
in terms of prechamber combustion and main chamber pressure rise
as  shown  in Fig.  10.  Zhao  et  al.  [155]  applied  the  G-equation  LES
formulation  based  on  the  work  of  Pitsch  [156]  to  investigate  cyclic
variations  of  a  homogeneous  charge  SI  engine.  While  they  kept  the
original  formulation  to  calculate  the  turbulent  flame  velocity  intro-
duced by Pitsch [156], laminar flame speed was modeled according to
Gülder [150]. Here, the authors reported that it was necessary to tune a
laminar flame speed model to match experimental data. Since emissions
were not of interest in their work, the authors did not solve chemistry
in the burned zones. The simulation model validation of 49 LES cycles
shows  good  agreement  with  experimental  in-cylinder  pressure  data.
Finally,  the  authors  investigated  the  influence  of  single  influencing
factors on cyclic behavior with the proposed framework. Unfortunately,
the authors did not provide information on ignition and early flame
modeling, so limited conclusions may be drawn on the capability of
the simulation to reconstruct the experimental CCV. Koch et al. [157]
employed a similar modeling framework to examine how addition of
hydrogen influences cyclic variations in a homogeneous charge natural
gas engine implementing an algebraic flame surface wrinkling model
according to Aluri et al. [158] for flame speed closure. Experimental
data  were  met  with  a  scaling  factor  of  0.9.  Ignition  was  initialized
by a 1 mm flame kernel between the spark electrodes; gradual grid
refinement appropriately resolved the flame kernel from its deposition.
The authors reported good agreement of the simulation results (30–40
LES cycles per operating point) with experimental in-cylinder pressure
values in terms of cyclic fluctuations as well as reproduction of the
effect  of  decreasing  CCV  by  adding  hydrogen.  For  the  investigation
of knocking combustion, several modeling strategies compatible with
the G-equation  formulation  exists.  Wu  et  al.  [159]  implemented  a
transport equation for the Livengood–Wu (L-W) integral to investigate
knock tendency of a gasoline SI engine. The corresponding reaction
rate  for  the  L-W  transport  equations  was  calculated  based  on  the
ignition  delay  which  was  determined  through  the  same  n-heptane

fired operating points. Furthermore, it does a good job of mimicking
the  flame  evolution  as  compared  with  optical  measurements.  Malé
et al. [187] applied TFM to an LES investigation of a homogeneous lean
mixture propane engine ignited by a prechamber. The authors referred
to the model of Charlette et al. [188] to determine E via tabulated
input data in terms of local laminar flame speed and flame thickness.
The desired chemistry is integrated into numerical simulation with an
analytically reduced chemistry scheme ultimately contains 32 species
and 153 reactions. Besides characterizing the jet properties, the work
includes a comprehensive description of the flame quantities helpful
to  understanding  the  TCI  in  the  main  combustion  chamber.  As  for
the  combustion  regimes,  the  flame  features  range  from  fast  mixing
regions  in  which  the  overall  reaction  rate  is  limited  by  chemistry
yielding no flamelet structure to wrinkled flame regions with highly
observable flamelet structures as combustion proceeds. This shows the
applicability and advantage of the TFM under this type of conditions
since  the  model  is  not  based  on  the  flamelet  assumption  and  thus
can  theoretically  account  for  all  combustion  regimes.  Nevertheless,
due  to  the  artificial  thickening  of  the  flame,  it  may  not  accurately
capture flame structure-depending information such as emissions. An
extension of the dynamic TFM to enable modeling of highly stratified
combustion was introduced by Kazmouz et al. [189]. The authors used
a  fifth-order  polynomial  to  calculate  the  local  laminar  flame  speed
according to d’Adamo et al. [190] which requires knowledge of the
local equivalence ratio as well as the unburned temperature. Thus, the
authors introduced an iterative process based on the unburned stan-
dardized enthalpy to determine these quantities and to further model
the local efficiency function. However, one unknown model constant
remains in the formulation used to calibrate the simulation model to
obtain  the  experimental  cylinder  pressure.  Furthermore,  the  authors
implemented the TFM wall treatment as proposed by Shekhawat [191]
to  avoid  artificial  flame  acceleration  near  the  walls  by  a  correction
based on the von-Karman constant. F and E are set to 1.0 to avoid an
overestimation of the wall heat loss. The ignition process is initiated by
a spherical energy disposition. Qualitatively good agreement in terms
of flame propagation between LES and laser-induced flourescence imag-
ing results was reported for an iso-octane engine under globally lean
part-load stratified conditions. Good agreement between experimental
averaged in-cylinder peak pressure and simulated value was reached
while the average pressure ramp-up was slightly delayed. Furthermore,
the observed cyclic variability fall within the experimental data range
(see Fig. 11).

Since the formulation of the TFM does not assume flamelet con-
ditions, this model can be considered as a regime-independent com-
bustion model for LES. However, the original form using global values
of F and static E for calibrating the simulation setup to experimental
data is limited to low-dynamics flows. By the use of the dynamic TFM
formulation, mixing and diffusion in other regions than the flame front
are avoided. In case of highly stretched flames, the burning velocity of a
thickened flame submitted to a stretch is not conserved compared to the
non-thickened solution, thus enhanced methods using different thick-
ening factors for mass and thermal diffusion zones, and modifying the
chemical source terms have been introduced recently [192]. At present,
these TFM advancements accounting explicitly for the stretching effects
are still not widely applied in the field of ICE combustion simulations.
Table 6 gives an overview of TFM applications for SI engines.

5.1.5.  Direct chemistry integration

Although the application of combustion models that take into ac-
count the interaction between the turbulent flow field and chemical
processes has been proven to yield good agreement between simula-
tion and experiments for spark ignition ICE, the direct integration of
chemistry mechanisms into the multi-dimensional CFD code has been
advanced in recent years. The method is based on the assumption of
chemical equilibrium in each computational cell in which the chemical
reactions are then solved based on the thermodynamic state without

chemical mechanism [160] as for the laminar flame speed calculation.
In addition to a satisfying agreement between measured and simulated
in-cylinder  pressure,  the  results  indicate  the  ability  of  the  approach
to predict knock limited spark advance. Since the use of RANS leads
to a loss of statistical information important for the quantitative es-
timation  of  knock,  Kircher  et  al.  [161]  enhanced  the  PDF  approach
introduced by Linse et al. [162] by solving a transport equation for the
Favre-averaged ignition progress conditioned on the unburned mixture.
Chen et al. [163] studied CCV of knocking combustion of a gasoline
SI  engine  applying G-equation  for  modeling  flame  propagation  and
detailed chemistry was employed in the unburned region to describe
the end gas autoignition. The comparison of 15 cycles under mild and
heavy  knock  conditions  showed  well  agreement  between  simulation
and experiments.

Modeling turbulent combustion by the use of the G-equation ap-
proach  is  one  of  the  standard  concepts  for  premixed  and  partially
premixed SI engines. Based on its formulation, the appropriate mod-
eling of sT and consequently sL are essential for accurate simulation
results. While sL links the chemical kinetics into the model framework,
the common modeling approaches of sT allow the calibration of the
simulation setup to meet experimental results. Ignition modeling and
the following initialization of the G =  0 iso-surface require further,
careful adjustments to get reliable results. As shown in several stud-
ies,  the  combination  of  the G-equation  model  with  direct  chemistry
integration enables the determination of emissions and autoignition.
G equation  model  application  examples  for  SI  enignes  are  listed  in
Table 5.

5.1.4.  Thickened flame model

Since  the  TFM  was  originally  developed  for  LES,  the  following
overview of application examples is limited to this turbulence modeling
framework.  Granet  et  al. [186] applied the  TFM to  investigate  CCV
of stable and unstable (diluted by N2) operating conditions of a pre-
mixed propane SI research engine. A total of 75 cycles were simulated:
50  unstable  and  25  stable  operating  points.  The  authors  described
the configuration of the efficiency function E, which was set to 2.0
for  both  operating  conditions.  Furthermore,  values  of  the  resulting
thickening factor F are provided that include values less than 8 for
unstable operating conditions and values close to 50 for stable condi-
tions indicating small flame thicknesses at stable conditions. Ignition
was handled with an energy deposition approach according to Lacaze
et al. [167]. As stated by the authors, the proposed simulation strategy
is  well  suited  to  predicting  qualitative  and  quantitative  CCV  of  real

direct consideration of turbulence. This approach can clearly lead to
comprehensive computational effort especially for hydrocarbon fuels
since  the  entire  reaction  mechanism  has  to  be  solved  in  each  com-
putational  cell.  Furthermore,  the  calculation  of  the  chemical  source
terms  based  on  averaged  values  as  is  the  case  in  RANS  turbulence
modeling can give rise to uncertainties in the determination of flame
front propagation. Several attempts to address these issues have been
presented  as  well  as  applied  to  numerical  simulation  of  ICEs.  Raju
et  al.  [199]  introduced  a  multi-zone  model  which  groups  computa-
tional  cells  into  zones  based  on  temperature  and  equivalence  ratio
whereas the chemistry is consequently solved only in each zone. A well-
known solver for chemistry reactions is the SAGE detailed chemistry
solver  [200],  which  directly  reads  chemical  reaction  mechanisms  in
CHEMKIN format [201]. To reduce the inaccuracy of using averaged
values in RANS framework for chemistry source term calculation as
well as the chemical equilibrium assumption, adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) strategies based on velocity and temperature have been widely
adopted. Salman et al. [202] applied the aforementioned techniques
to model both a direct injection as well as a port-fuel injection spark-
ignition  engine.  The  authors  investigated  the  influence  of  reduced
chemical mechanisms (one from the literature, two reduced by the au-
thors based on pressure range) on the simulation results and concluded,
that the reduced mechanism choice significantly influences the results
and furthermore the mechanism reduction range should cover condi-
tions similar to the desired engine operating conditions. Chinnathambi
et  al.  [203]  modeled  a  prechamber  combustion  system  under  lean
operating conditions using direct chemistry integration of a 38-species
iso-octane mechanism and AMR. The authors reported the use of a very
high refinement level to overcome temperature underprediction in thin-
flame regions. As the results indicated, good agreement was achieved

21

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101200

between numerical simulation and prechamber as well as main cham-
ber pressure. Ravindran et al. [204] investigated the applicability of
detailed chemistry integration for a direct injection spark-ignition en-
gine during cold start. The authors compared the detailed chemistry
approach that includes a SAGE chemistry solver, multi-zone modeling
and  AMR  with  G-equation  combustion  model.  While  the  G-equation
approach  showed  good  agreement  with  experimental  data  in  terms
of in-cylinder pressure, the detailed chemistry method in combination
with  a  energy  decomposition  model  according  to  Yang  et  al.  [205]
underestimated flame propagation and thus comprehensively deviated
from  measurement  data.  To  explain  this  behavior,  the  authors  used
combustion regime diagrams to illustrate the flame travel during cold
start. It was concluded that the flame reached the laminar regime where
the detailed chemistry method is limited since grid sizes in the range
of the laminar flame thickness are required.

There is an increasing trend in the ICE simulation community to
use detailed chemistry integration in the RANS framework based on the
SAGE solver [200], multi-zone modeling and AMR. While AMR allows
a fine resolution of the flame front in the order of the laminar flame
thickness, the use of averaged values to calculate the chemical source
terms and thus the complete neglect of the TCI is a significant limita-
tion, especially for propagating flames in SI engines. Due to the strong
nonlinearity of the chemical source term, calibration measures in the
form of reaction mechanism multipliers are more sensitive compared to
tuning parameters in TCI-aware combustion models such as G-equation
models and should therefore be applied with caution. Direct chemistry
modeling applications for SI engines are listed in Table 7.

5.2.  Compression-ignition engines

5.2.1.  Characteristic time-scale model

As mentioned in the preface of subchapter 5.1.1, the following CI
engine application examples are based on the PaSR modeling approach.
D’Errico et al. [224] compared the computationally effective EDM and
the PaSR model on a diesel engine simulating six operating conditions
covering full and partial loads, with three different injection strategies
and injection timings at full load and three different EGR rates at partial
load.  The  model  parameters  were  specified  as Cmix =  0.005 for  the
PaSR  model  and A =  4 and B =  1 for  EDM.  To  speed-up  compu-
tation  of  the  PaSR  simulation,  an  in-situ  adaptive  tabulation  (ISAT)
algorithm [225] including the reduced mechanism of Patel et al. [226]
was  implemented.  The  authors  reported  that  the  PaSR  model  made
good predictions of peak pressure as compared to experimental data
while it overestimated the ignition delay. In contrast, the EDM model
using the Wolfer correlation [227] provided a better estimate of the
autoignition time but underestimated peak pressure. Fraioli et al. [228]
investigated  a  DF  (diesel/natural  gas)  engine  numerically  using  the
PaSR combustion model. The required reaction kinetics for DF mode
were incorporated by the reduced chemical kinetics mechanism accord-
ing  to  Rahimi  et  al.  [229]  combined  with  an  ISAT  algorithm  [225]
and dynamic adaptive chemistry [230] for computation time reduction.
In-cylinder and rate of heat release comparisons between simulation
and  experiment  for  three  low  to  medium  speed  and  load  operating
points,  with  different  the  diesel/natural  gas  ratios,  showed  overall
good  agreement  in  terms  of  ignition  delays,  combustion  phases  and
peak  values  (see Fig.  12).  Results  in  terms  of  in-cylinder  pressures
and  rate  of  heat  release  .  The  engine  working  groups  at  University
of Modena and Reggio Emilia and Chalmers University of Technology
pushed ahead and applied the PaSR model to account for TCI. Mattarelli
et  al.  [231]  is  a  representative  study  in  which  PaSR  is  applied  to
numerical simulation of a two-stroke CI aircraft engine operating at
low to medium speeds and full load. The detailed chemical kinetics
model  of  a  diesel  oil  surrogate  is  based  on  blending  n-heptane  and
toluene as shown by Golovitchev et al. [232]. The modeling generally
follows the procedure proposed in Golovitchev et al. [233] in which a
provisional value for τmix based on the k − ε turbulence model must

be  refined  in  comparison  with  experiments.  The  authors  claimed  to
use a unique parameter setting which yielded reasonable agreement
between simulation and experiment with different engine speed and
fuel injection strategies. A similar simulation approach has been applied
to a CI engine with diesel/syngas blends [234], a diesel/natural gas
dual fuel light duty engine [235] and a diesel/natural gas/hydrogen
dual fuel engine [236]. Unfortunately, the details of the tuned values
of τmix are not provided in the available studies. Xu et al. [237] used
the PaSR model to compare HCCI and partially premixed combustion
concepts fueled with iso-octane and methanol. The mixing time τmix
was  directly  determined  from  the  turbulence  quantities  derived  by
the  turbulence  model.  Further  tuning  to  match  experimental  results
was  not  reported  in  the  study.  A  skeletal  mechanism  according  to
Liu  et  al.  [238]  was  applied  to  account  for  the  fuel  chemistry.  The
comparison between simulation and experimental in-cylinder pressure
and heat release rate showed overall good. Table 8 gives an overview
of characteristic time-scale model applications for CI engines.

engine simulation application of the transported PDF approach. Based
on  earlier  works  [241,242],  Zhang  et  al.  [243]  presented  a  general
procedure  enabling  the  use  of  transported  PDF  in  a  finite  volume
code for engine RANS simulation and applied it to an HCCI research
engine. They employed a chemical kinetics mechanism which covers
40  species  and  165  reactions  [232]  to  model  n-heptane  combustion
and implemented ISAT to accelerate computation. It was necessary to
solve 41 joint PDFs since mixture enthalpy had to be considered. The
PDF transport equations are solved via a hybrid particle/finite-volume
method while the particle side is handled with a Lagrangian Monte
Carlo  method.  The  authors  compared  the  results  of  the  transported
PDF model with a direct chemistry integration that does not account
for turbulent flow in the calculation of the species mass fractions. As
the results for different investigated operating conditions indicate, the
deviation between the proposed PDF methodology and the simulation
without TCI can be significant especially at operating conditions char-
acterized  by  high  swirl  or  mixture  inhomogeneity.  Since  the  study
does not contain a validation with experimental data, the quality of
the simulation method cannot be evaluated. Another study carried out
by Kung and Haworth [244] includes the validation of the simulation
results by experimental engine data. While their work is mainly based
on the aforementioned formalism, they also provide insight into the
mixing model parameterization regarded as the key model constant for
transported PDF approaches. A sensitivity study analyzed the influence
of CΦ on  the  in-cylinder  pressure  result.  The  authors  used  a  value
of 2.0 which was referenced to related studies. Using a 40-species n-
heptane mechanism [226], the simulation achieved results with good
agreement between simulation and measurements of a direct injection
diesel engine. Mohan and Haworth [245] applied the transported PDF
formalism to heavy duty diesel engine simulation. Similar to the afore-
mentioned studies, the authors used a 40-species n-heptane mechanism
to represent diesel fuel but in this case with additional reactions for
NOx and  soot.  Thus,  45  joint  PDF  equations  had  to  be  solved.  The
model constant of the mixing model CΦ was set to 2.0, which is in
line with similar studies. The transported PDF model results were again
compared with direct chemistry simulations, which totally neglected
turbulent  chemistry  interaction,  as  well  as  experiments.  While  the
direct chemistry simulation lead to a fast combustion and thus to too
high  in-cylinder  peak  pressure,  the  PDF  model  was  able  to  achieve
better agreement with experimental values. Furthermore, investigations

Transported PDF provides a detailed representation of the TCI with
chemistry directly integrated . Due to the statistical representation of
the  flow,  the  mean  velocity  appears  in  a  closed  form.  The  required
modeling for the molecular mixing provides the opportunity to cali-
brate the simulation via the underlying model parameters. However,
the considerable computational effort even for RANS setups makes this
approach impractical for industrial applications. CI engine application
examples of the transported PDF model are listed in Table 9.

5.2.3.  Conditional moment closure

De  Paola  et  al.  [250]  conducted  one  of  the  first  studies  of  the
implementation of CMC on an engine CFD platform. They described
in detail the integration of the CMC code into the finite-volume based
RANS CFD environment. A 3D structured grid was built on which the
desired CMC equations were solved by using first-order discretization.
The  CMC  grid  was  set  to  be  coarser  than  the  CFD  one  since  the
conditional quantities are not as spatially dependent as unconditional
values  [110].  Furthermore,  the  authors  described  the  consideration
of  an  additional  convective  term  in  the  CMC  equation  which  arises
from  the  sliding  grid.  Using  a  31-species  reduced  mechanism  for  n-
heptane  [251],  the  authors  investigated  the  accuracy  of  the  CMC
formulation  in  terms  of  the  spatial  resolution  and  found  that  a  2D
formulation in which the azimuthal direction is collapsed yields similar
results to a full 3D formulation. Thus, the 2D formulation was applied
to reduce the computational cost. However, they concluded that further
measurements in terms of pollutant emissions and flame front imaging
are  required  for  a  more  detailed  validation  of  the  CMC  approach.
Bolla  et  al.  [252]  used  the  previously  described  CMC  methodology
to  model  the  soot  formation  in  an  optically  accessible  heavy-duty
diesel  engine.  To  this  end,  a  two-equation  soot  model  according  to
Lueng et al. [253] was implemented with n-heptane as the surrogate
fuel [254]. The simulation results indicate an accurate prediction of

speed and load, with two levels of oxygen concentrations emulating
different EGR rates, although the simulation tends to underestimate the
portion of premixed burn. Furthermore, the prediction of soot cloud
evolution based on a line-of-sight transformation of the computational
results was qualitatively in good agreement with experimental results
(see Fig.  13).  The  authors  also  provided  a  useful  discussion  of  the
influence of n-heptane as a surrogate model for the simulation of soot
and concluded that pure n-heptane oxidation chemistry might be ques-
tionable for high-temperature combustion conditions in diesel engines
since polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons play an important role. Trivedi
et al. [255] proposed an incomplete stirred reactor (ISR) model based
on the spatial integration of the CMC equations as a post-processing
step that enables the computationally efficient integration of complex
soot  models.  The  authors  compared  the  direct  integration  of  a  two-
equation soot model into the CMC framework and the ISR results in
terms of soot and concluded that the CMC two-equation soot approach
shows  good  agreement  with  experimental  results  whereas  the  ISR
method overestimates soot mass fraction and particle size distribution.
Huang  et  al.  [256]  applied  CMC  to  model  combustion  in  a  diesel
pilot  injected  natural  gas  engine  in  an  LES  framework.  The  authors
used conditional source term estimation [257] for the CMC LES for-
mulation. Furthermore, low-dimensional manifold for the integration
of the reaction mechanism [114] was used involving a 159-species and
770-reactions n-heptane mechanism for diesel [258] and a modified
55-species and 770-reactions GRI mechanism for natural gas [259]. The
authors claimed that the simulation was able to predict experimental
values for in-cylinder pressure and emissions under several operating
conditions.

Due to the multi-dimensional nature of the CMC governing equa-
tions  and  the  large  number  of  conditional  scalars  that  have  to  be
solved, the computational costs for CMC combustion modeling is sig-
nificant. However, as shown in the reviewed works, different remedies
to  decrease  the  computational  effort  such  as  the  collapse  of  a  spa-
tial  dimension  or  by  using  low-dimensional  manifolds  for  chemistry

combustion can be investigated as intended by the authors. With both
models, the simulation results and the measured in-cylinder pressure
as well as heat release rate were a very good match. Thus, the authors
concluded that the combustion rates of this combustion concept are
mainly  determined  by  the  mixing  rates  rather  than  chemical  source
terms.  This  conclusion  does  not  agree  with  a  study  by  Kung  and
Haworth [244] which compares transported PDF and direct chemistry
integration for a similar engine configuration. Here the authors stressed
the relevance of TCI in combustion modeling. Wu et al. [264] applied
direct chemistry integration based on the SAGE solver [200] and AMR
to investigate the effect of the methane number on natural gas and
diesel  DF  combustion.  A  chemical  mechanism  according  to  Hocket
et al. [265] was selected which combines a reduced n-heptane sub-
mechanism and methane/ethane/propane sub-mechanism to account
for DF combustion and a 4-species NOx mechanism introduced by Sun
and Reitz [266]. The simulation was validated with experimental data
from a test engine in RCCI and diesel-pilot injection mode, yielding
good agreement in terms of n-cylinder pressure while overpredicting
the heat release rate. This could be explained by calculating the heat
release  rate  between  simulation  and  experiment  as  well  as  the  un-
certainties in the fuel mass estimation. Fig. 14 shows the calculated
NOx emissions over methane number and MFB50. Li and Kong [267]
combined LES and direct chemistry integration to model the combus-
tion process of a direct injection diesel engine. To integrate the diesel
combustion chemistry they adopted a reduced n-heptane mechanism
consisting of 34 species and 74 reactions was adopted. A phenomeno-
logical soot model according to Han et al. [268] was also implemented.
Single-cycle LES results and mean experimental values were compared
in terms of in-cylinder pressure, soot as well as NOx at different levels
of EGR and starts of injection. The authors reported good agreement
with regard to in-cylinder pressure and trends in soot and NOx levels
with all investigated operating points. In contrast to propagating flames
in which TCI directly affects the flame front (see 5.1.5), mixing is the
dominant process for diffusion flames. Several works refer to the study
of  Kokjohn  and  Reitz  [269]  in  which  the  authors  stated  that  small-
scale interactions between turbulence and chemistry may not play a
dominant role in the overall combustion process of the investigated
low-temperature diesel combustion case, to justify the neglect of TCI in
non-premixed ICE applications. Kokjohn and Reitz [269] further argued
that  effects  of  turbulence  on  combustion  are  already  accounted  for
through property transport, heat flux, and mixture preparation at the
resolved scales. While this statement may be feasible in certain cases,
a general justification to neglect TCI in CI engines cannot be derived.
Table 11 gives an overview of detailed chemistry modeling application
for CI engines.

5.2.5.  Flamelet-based model

The integration of chemical kinetics to account for finite rate chem-
istry  via  flamelet  approaches  is  a  well-known  concept  for  turbulent
combustion  modeling  in  CI  engines.  Assuming  steady-state  flamelet

have been applied producing satisfying simulation results. Application
examples of the CMC model for CI engines are listed in Table 10.

5.2.4.  Direct chemistry integration

Early studies of direct integration of chemistry into 3d ICE simu-
lation date back to the research group of Prof. Reitz at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison. They integrated the CHEMKIN code [201] into
their  engine  simulation  tool  KIVA.  Kong  et  al.  [262]  described  the
principal modeling approach and applied it on an HCCI engine with
several fuels and EGR level combinations. A reduced n-heptane mech-
anism  with  211  species  and  1174  reactions  was  applied  for  natural
gas  and  ethanol,  and  a  79-species  and  398-reactions  mechanism  for
iso-octane. The authors validated the calculated in-cylinder pressure
with measured values whereas the simulation was carried out using
purely kinetics-controlled reaction rates as well as mixing-controlled
reaction  rates  based  on  the  PaSR  approach.  The  results  clearly  in-
dicated that the purely kinetics-controlled reaction rates results in a
too  fast  combustion,  whereas  mixing-controlled  reaction  rates  slow
down combustion and thus match the measurement values. The authors
therefore concluded that it is necessary to incorporate the effects of
flow turbulence in the chemical reaction rates of this engine type. Kong
et al. [263] compared the direct chemistry integration to simulate a
premixed charge diesel engine with the RIF model. Since the direct
chemistry integration does not account for subgrid scale TCI whereas
the RIF model does by using the scalar dissipation rate for flamelet
definition, the influence of the mixing and chemical source terms on

the combustion process in an optical PPCI engine. They compared 4D-
FGM,  5D-FGM  and  PaSR  combustion  modeling.  While  the  4D-FGM
predicted  very  late  ignition  and  thus  significant  deviation  from  the
experimental results in terms of in-cylinder pressure and heat release
rate, the 5D-FGM led to good agreement with the experiments. The 5D-
FGM also performed better than the PaSR model (the authors noted,
that  tuning  the  PaSR  mmodel  constant Cmix would  lead  to  better
results). Due to the small number of transport equations solved by the
FGM method compared to PaSR, the authors reported a roughly 90%
reduction  in  computational  time.  Kundu  et  al.  [301]  used  the  FGM
method  and  RANS  turbulence  modeling  to  simulate  the  combustion
process in a direct injection CI engine. The authors used a multiple-
flamelet approach according to Barths et al. [302] in which multiple
flamelets are introduced into the computational domain sequentially
through spray injection. To determine the sensitivity of the number of
flamelets used, the authors compared two different settings of flamelet
numbers, namely 40 and 100. The results showed that both numbers of
flamelets predicted an equal in-cylinder pressure trace while the higher
number of flamelets yielded fewer oscillations in the heat release rate.
In  contrast  to  calculating  the  flamelets  in  a  pre-processing  step,  the
RIF model uses a separate code which is interactively coupled with the
CFD code. The flamelet time steps are usually much smaller than the
CFD time step leading to a decoupling of the time scales of the fluid
dynamics and the chemistry. Thus, RIF modeling requires more compu-
tational time than tabulated approaches. Jochim et al. [303] integrated
unsteady flamelets with the RIF model [304] to investigate PCCI com-
bustion  concepts  in  RANS  framework.  Several  operating  conditions
including  start  of  injection,  injected  fuel  mass  and  EGR  variations
have been simulated and validated by measurement results. In-cylinder
trace comparison indicated good agreement between simulation and

elements, methods such as the FGM method [299] use pre-calculated
look-up tables in which a low-dimensional manifold of the 1D solutions
of the laminar opposed-flow diffusion flamelet (Fig. 7) in composition
space are stored. Xu et al. [300] applied FGM and LES to investigate

experiments. The authors reported that pressure before start of combus-
tion, ignition timing, the combustion process and the expansion phase
were excellently captured. Zhou et al. [305] compared RIF modeling
and  the  tabulated  flamelet  progress  variable  (TFPV)  approach  on  a
direct injection CI engine RANS simulation. They used a single flamelet
formulation  for  RIF  to  reduce  computational  cost.  The  definition  of
the progress variable was based on the enthalpy definition proposed
by Lehtiniemi et al. [306]. To verify model consistency, the authors
analyzed the energy balance by integrating the heat release rate over a
wide range of engine speed and load variations. The results indicated
a slight underestimate with the transported flamelet/progress variable
(TFPV) approach compared to the RIF model. Additional evaluations of
the in-cylinder pressure profile and heat release rate showed the good
agreement of both methods. Fig. 15 shows the comparison between the
temperature distribution in mixture fraction space and ignition location
combustion models at the onset of combustion for both models. It can
be seen, that the highest temperature in the RIF occurs at the end and
in the vicinity of the spray jet where liquid fuel still exits whereas the
reaction zone in the TFPV case is relatively farther from the liquid core.
While the integration of chemistry into turbulent combustion simu-
lation via predefined flamelet tables is a widely used approach in non-
premixed combustion applications. However, some important aspects
should  be  discussed.  Due  to  the  comprehensive  increase  in  memory
requirement  for  the  tabulated  data,  the  number  of  used  parameters
(dimensions) is limited. Recent studies addressed this issue by applying
machine learning methods (cf. 6.4.1). Furthermore, the definition of
the progress variable can have a significant influence on the simulation
results [307]. In case of partially-premixed combustion, the dependence
of the flamelet table generation on the assumption of a single combus-
tion mode requires the definition of partially premixed flamelets [308]
or blending between diffusion and premixed tabulated flamelets [309].
Application examples of flamelet-based models for SI engines are listed
in Table 12.

5.2.6.  Coherent flame model

Thanks to the development of the ECFM3Z by Colin and Benkenida
[92],  the  use  of  the  coherent  flame  concept  in  the  field  of  direct
injection  CI  engines  has  been  straightforward.  Based  on  this  work,
Priesching  et  al.  [325]  applied  the  ECFM3Z  to  investigate  a  wide
range  of  combustion  system  parameters  of  a  direct  injection  diesel
engine  within  a  RANS  turbulence  framework.  The  authors  further
implemented a NOx model according to Vujanovic et al. [326] which
covers thermal and prompt NO formation as well as a flamelet-library-
based  soot  model  [327]  and  tabulated  autoignition  model  based  on
a  complex  reaction  mechanism  [328].  As  the  results  on  in-cylinder

pressure, soot volume fraction and NOx emissions show, the simulation
approach is able to provide good quality predictions of experimental
values. Aubagnac-Karkar et al. [329] used homogeneous reactors calcu-
lations at variable pressure [330] to generate chemistry look-up tables
which allows the representation of minor species required by the soot
model. The comparison of simulated in-cylinder pressure and heat re-
lease rates with experimental data indicate that the model overpredicts
the autoignition delay; it was concluded that this is due to errors in
the complex chemistry mechanism at high EGR rates, inaccuracies of
the spray model and the absence of the strain effects in the ECFM3Z.
However, the validation of the soot emissions yielded good agreement
with  the  measurements.  Eder  et  al.  [331]  took  the  ECFM3Z  as  the
basis  for  RANS  modeling  of  a  diesel  ignited  large  gas  engine.  This
study mainly focused on developing of an appropriate model for two-
stage autoignition for DF combustion by using experimental validated
interpolation  functions.  Furthermore,  the  laminar  flame  speed  was
calculated by linear interpolation of n-heptane and methane values via
the DF mixture fraction. The authors reported overall good agreement
between simulation and single-cylinder measurements in terms of in-
cylinder pressure and rate of heat release. Frühhaber and Lauer [332]
adapted the ECFM-LES formulation investigate DF engines, applying
an autoignition model based on an Arrhenius-type function. Laminar
flame speed was determined using a reduced mechanism according to
Schuh et al. [313]. Diesel was represented by n-heptane and natural
gas by a methane-propane mixture. A total number of 25 consecutive
cycles was calculated indicating, well predicted in-cylinder and heat
release rates compared with 250 measured cycles whereas three cycles
identified as outliers have peak pressure values that are too high. The
authors developed a methodology to extract the combustion regimes
from the LES results based on the area in the vicinity of the flame front
specified by the reaction progress variable. Fig. 16 shows the occurring
combustion regimes for different crank angles and an example of the
evaluated flame front area. The results indicated that DF combustion
includes a wide range of different combustion regimes from thin reac-
tion zones to corrugated flamelet regions and to broken reaction zones
underlining the demand of multi-regime combustion models.

The ECFM3Z in combination with auto-ignition models such as the
TKI are widely used in CI engine applications. Due to the consideration
of  turbulent  mixing  the  gas  properties  in  the  unburned  and  burned
gases  of  the  mixed  zone  can  be  reconstructed.  Since  the  ECFM3Z
formulation is based on the original ECFM, the application notes from
sub Section 5.1.2 can be adopted. Coherent flame model application
examples of SI engines are listed in Table 13.

5.3.  Conclusion of ICE applications

The  review  of  recent  application  cases  in  ICE  modeling  shows
several  trends.  As  SI  engines  are  increasingly  operated  at  lean  or

highly diluted conditions, different demands are placed on turbulent
combustion  modeling.  The  increase  in K a due  to  the  slowdown  in
combustion-related chemical processes as well as increased in-cylinder
turbulence  lead  to  operation  at  non-flamelet  regimes.  When  TJI  is
used, this effect is even more pronounced. Furthermore, the flame does
not  remain  confined  to  a  single  regime  throughout  the  combustion
process.  Although  reasonable  results  can  be  achieved  by  tuning  the
model  constants,  this  practice  often  compromises  the  fundamental
accuracy and predictive capability of the models. TFM is one option
with  the  restriction,  that  no  information  on  the  flame  structure  at
smaller scales can be resolved. Thus, further research on more advanced
multi-regime combustion models will be part of future investigations.
A clear trend towards direct chemistry integration in combination with
AMR can be observed. While advanced multi-zone strategies have been
introduced to keep the computational time within reasonable limit, the
implications associated with neglecting TCI as well as reaction rates
determination using averaged (RANS) or filtered (LES) thermochemical
parameters should be kept in mind. Another trend that was identified
is  the  increasing  use  of  LES  especially  for  the  investigation  of  CCV
reporting remarkable numbers of simulated cycles. However, since the
variation in the early flame is a major source of CCV, it is critical to
focus  on  accurately  modeling  and  understanding  of  ignition  process
and early combustion phase. Less sophisticated approaches based on
energy  or  scalar  field  sourcing,  are  not  able  to  account  for  early
flame variations leading to cyclic variations solely caused by the fully
turbulent flame propagation. In contrast, advanced models including
the  spark  ignition  process  and  the  transition  from  laminar  to  fully
turbulent flame enable the impact of turbulence during the early stages
of ignition to be captured, thereby enhancing the predictive accuracy
of CCV. Nevertheless, future research based on early flame DNS and
optical measurements is required to further increase the accuracy and
applicability of the models.

With  regard  to  CI  engines,  the  development  of  LTC  concepts  to
reduce NOx emissions impacts turbulent combustion modeling at differ-
ent levels. Accurate determination of the autoignition process in a wide
range of thermochemical and fluid dynamic conditions is a prerequisite
to accurately predicting combustion with these concepts. At low tem-
perature conditions, the influence of turbulence on the ignition process
can be significant [335] and thus neglecting TCI can cause substantial
deviations in the prediction of ignition timing and combustion stability.
Appropriate  reaction  mechanisms  for  ignition  delay  predictions  that
cover the range of fuels are essential. Furthermore, the onset of multiple
combustion modes in advanced combustion concepts such as PPCI or
DF places high demands on turbulent combustion modeling. Charac-
terized by a blend of partially-premixed and non-premixed combustion
phases, these complex modes require sophisticated models that accu-
rately capture the interactions between fuel stratification, autoignition,
and flame propagation at varying levels of turbulence.

6.  Recent advances and future prospects

After a description of the main turbulent combustion models avail-
able for ICE simulation and the required modeling framework as well as
an overview of ICE application examples, this section discusses recent
advances in this field and provides an outlook of directions direction
for  future  research.  The  focus  is  on  the  integration  of  future  fuels
and  associated  demands  on  turbulent  combustion  modeling,  further
development of turbulent combustion models to deal with future trends
in ICE operation and integration of machine learning.

6.1.  Combustion model development

Before the integration of future fuels into the turbulent combustion
simulation workflow of ICE is discussed, a brief overview of the further
development  of  combustion  models  for  RANS  and  LES  framework

is  given.  In  order  to  establish  a  structured  systematic  approach,  a
modified version of the strategy shown by Pitsch and Trisjono [33] is
applied. A sequence of experiments and DNS allows the validation and
further development of turbulent combustion models which is shown
by several examples in the following.

Starting at the top level, an engine simulation applying turbulent
combustion modeling in RANS or LES framework is applied showing
model  deficiencies  quantified  by  comparison  of  in-cylinder  pressure
or rate of heat release of experimental data. In the next level, deeper
insights into in-cylinder turbulent combustion events can be achieved
by  the  use  of  optical  accessible  devices  such  as  rapid  compression
machines  (RCM)  or  optical  engines.  Optical  accessibility  allows  the
investigation  of  modeling  requirements  or  the a  posteriori validation
of  combustion  models.  Research  engines  such  as  the  TCC-III  engine
of  the  University  of  Michigan  or  the  well-known  Darmstadt  engine
provide ‘‘canonical engine cases’’ for the validation of numerical mod-
els. Shekhawat et al. [336] compared TFM and ECFM LES combustion
modeling in terms of CCV and early flame development based on TCC-
III data. The authors concluded that both models yield rather different
combustion  behavior  compared  to  experiments  and  underlined  their
limitations to capture the early flame. d’Adamo et al. [337] also used
the TCC-III engine data to validate their adapted formulation of the
ISSIM-LES model. The authors calculated an equivalent flame diameter
to enable the quantitative comparison between simulation and optical
measurements. Gholamisheeri et al. [338] used an RCM to study RANS
and LES turbulent combustion simulation of a TJI system. By compar-
ing  simulation  results  based  on  detailed  chemistry  integration  using
the SAGE chemistry solver [200] with experimental data, the authors
investigated the influence of the reaction mechanism on ignition delay
prediction and the ability of the setup to capture autoignition. Further-
more, the different steps of the ignition process were evaluated and the
limitations of the detailed chemistry model in predicting flame ignition
due to the neglect of TCI were highlighted. In the next steps, lab-scale
experiments  and  corresponding  DNS  cases  are  defined  targeting  the
same combustion regime as occurring in the initial system. In the case
of  ICE,  fan-stirred  constant  volume  combustion  chambers  [339,340]
are  used  to  realize  reproducible  turbulent  conditions  allowing  fun-
damental flame investigations using optical measurement techniques.
Furthermore, reference cases such as the Engine Combustion Network
(ECN)  data  base  for  diffusion  flames  enable  standardized  conditions
to  validate  and  further  develop  models.  García-Oliver  et  al.  [341]
used  the  ECN  Spray  A  and  Spray  D  configuration  to  compare  the
detailed chemistry approach and the unsteady flamelet progress vari-
able combustion model in terms of their ability to predict autoignition
and ignition delay time in RANS simulation environment. The results
showed  that  the  flamelet-based  approach  delivers  a  more  accurate
prediction of global combustion indicators indicating that refined TCI
model is needed to successfully predict combustion in this spray types
with RANS turbulence model. The unsteady flamelet progress variable
combustion  model  was  also  used  by  Desantes  et  al.  [342]  for  the
LES  of  the  ECN  Spray  A  case.  This  study  confirmed  the  ability  of
the flamelet concept to describe the flame structure accurately. Wen
et  al.  [343]  used  DNS  of  the  ECN  Spray  A  flame  to  investigate  the
mixture field interactions and the scalar dissipation rate on the igni-
tion process. By applying a flamelet regime classification method, the
study showed that that the conventional unsteady 1D non-premixed
flamelet model is capable of predicting the auto-ignition process, but
may be insufficient to predict the interaction-ignition process due to
the occurring premixed combustion mode. However, 3D DNS of these
lab-scale experiments are scarce due to the enormous computational
effort resolving the required turbulent Re levels. Several studies used
2D DNS of lab-scale experiments to keep computational effort within
reasonable  limits  [344,345].  However,  to  preserve  the  3D  character
of turbulent flows, DNS of simpler configurations are performed. The
choice of appropriate DNS unit problems allows deeper insights into the
fundamental flame characteristics enabling the derivation of turbulent

combustion modeling aspects. Comprehensive research on combustion
DNS  for  engine-relevant  fundamental  cases  have  been  done  by  the
RWTH  Aachen  combustion  group  especially  on  the  investigation  of
early flame kernel development [346–349] and hydrogen flame prop-
erties  [350–352].  Proch  et  al.  [353]  used  DNS  data  of  a  premixed
burner to validate the sub-filter wrinkling factor definition for the TFM
combustion model by comparing a priori PDF with a posteriori modeled
ones by LES. Han et al. [354] studied the DTFLES turbulent combustion
model  on  high K a turbulent  premixed  flames  by  the  use  of  DNS
data. The authors compared two different chemistry integration namely
detailed chemistry and tabulated chemistry based on strained premixed
flamelet modeling. Based on the results, the authors concluded that the
DTFLES with detailed chemistry integration is capable of reproducing
most  features  of  the  investigated  premixed  flame  whereas  tabulated
approach showed some discrepancy with DNS data due to tabulation
assumptions but is still expected to be useful due to advantages in com-
putational costs. Further examples of using information of canonical
flames DNS to enhance RANS and LES turbulent combustion modeling
are listed in the review of Domingo and Vervisch [355].

As this brief review shows, the systematic approach of moving from
the  top  to  the  bottom  and  back  again  —  combining a  priori and a
posteriori model evaluations — facilitates the validation and continuous
improvement  of  turbulent  combustion  models.  By  grounding  model
development in fundamental experiments and DNS, this process ensures
that  models  remain  both  accurate  and  relevant  across  the  desired
engine applications. The application of this procedure not only refines
existing  models  but  also  the  development  of  models  capturing  the
properties of future fuels as shown in the next section (see Fig. 17).

6.2.  Integration of future fuels

Growing  concerns  about  climate  change  and  the  finite  nature  of
fossil fuels are impacting the transition from mainly carbon-based fuels
such as gasoline and diesel to carbon-free fuels and bio fuels for ICE
application. In addition to development measures for the ICE system
to  deal  with  alternative  fuels,  the  research  on  modeling  aspects  of
turbulent combustion is a prerequisite to understanding its underlying
physics and thus enabling the transition of ICE technology to achieving
sustainable  energy  generation.  Since  past  development  of  turbulent
combustion models for ICE applications was mainly related to carbon-
based fuels, model adaptions will be unavoidable. To remain in line

with the scope of the present review, this section focuses on turbulent
combustion modeling aspects of alternative fuels. Note that the selected
fuels are only a sample of potential fuels. From the authors’ perspective,
however,  the  following  fuels  namely  hydrogen,  ammonia,  methanol
and synthetic fuels such as dimethyl ether and oxymethylene ethers
represent  the  main  significant  future  alternatives  to  diesel,  gasoline
and  methane.  The  requirements  for  turbulent  combustion  modeling
are  twofold:  while  the  thermodiffusive  instabilities  of  hydrogen  and
hydrogen-mixture  flames  requires  significant  adaptions  in  turbulent
combustion models assuming Le of unity, other fuels require the pro-
vision of adequate data to incorporate chemical kinetics and laminar
flame speeds into the simulation frameworks.

6.2.1.  Hydrogen

The use of hydrogen (H2) as the primary fuel in ICEs is increasingly
being pushed since generation of so-called green H2 from renewables
will increase considerably in the next decades. Furthermore, combus-
tion of H2 in ICEs indicate great potential since mo tank-to-wheel CO2
emissions at the tailpipe (though emissions due to engine oil cannot
be ignored) are produces and the ICE can also handle non-purified H2
in contrast to fuel cells. With regard to thermo-chemical properties, H2
has a higher laminar flame speed and higher flammability ranges than
conventional fuels such as gasoline, enabling operation at very lean
conditions  and  leading  to  a  comprehensive NOx reduction  potential
(above the NOx threshold) [356]. Yet from the perspective of turbulent
combustion modeling, several aspects of H2 require special treatment.
The high mass diffusivity of H2 compared to carbon-based fuels leads
to non-unity Lewis numbers Le directly influencing the local reaction
rate  due  to  changes  in  the  internal  structure  of  the  flame  reaction
zone [357]. Dinkelacker et al. [358] gave an illustrative explanation
of  the  high Le influence  on  the  local  reaction  rate  even  for  highly
turbulent premixed flames where turbulent mixing usually dominates
the physics in the reaction zone. They claim that flame brush regions
with  mostly  positive  curvatures  are  assumed  to  be  dominant  in  the
flame propagation process whereas the negative curvature regions are
assumed to affect the flame brush thickness (see Fig. 18). Although a
statistical view of the global flame brush should result in an average
of  both  positive  and  negative  curvature  regions  in  high  turbulence
flows  and  consequently  eliminates  low Le influence,  the  observed
flame behavior disagrees [359]. This effect increases at higher pres-
sures [360,361], thus becoming more pronounced in ICEs. The resulting
turbulent flame speeds may be order of magnitudes higher than the
corresponding laminar flame speeds [362]. To derive appropriate phys-
ical modeling of H2 combustion in ICE, detailed flame investigations
using experiments or DNS of canonical flames provide detailed insights
as shown in the recent review of Pitsch [363]. Since thermodiffusive
instabilities lead to significant differences between H2 and conventional
hydrocarbon fuels in terms of flame surface area dynamics and flame
morphology, fundamental studies help to understand physical princi-
ples and to derive accurate models. By the use of DNS of premixed
slot  burner  flames,  Berger  et  al.  [364]  investigated  thermodiffusive
instabilities comparing one reference case with realistic diffusion co-
efficients and one with unity Le. Their results showed that the overall
consumption speed is about three times faster and thus the turbulent
flame speed is increased by a factor of three due to thermodiffusive
instabilities which is an important aspect for the derivation of turbulent
flame speed models. In order to characterize thermodiffusive instable
flames,  Aspden  et  al.  [365]  and  later  Howarth  et  al.  [366]  showed
that  classical  premixed  combustion  regime  diagrams  are  inadequate
for  thermodiffusive  instable  flames  by  the  use  of  DNS.  The  authors
proposed  to  use  the  mean  local  flame  speed  and  thickness  in  the
definition of Karlovitz number and to rescale the turbulent premixed
regime diagram by freely-propagating values instead of their laminar
counterparts. This enhanced regime diagram is important to character-
ize H2 flames in ICE and consequently derive modeling strategies. Chu
et al. [351] investigated the H2 flames flame kernel development under

engine-like conditions using DNS. By comparing two cases having unity
and  non-unity Le,  respectively,  the  results  indicated  that  while  the
distortion of the kernel shape is mainly due to the tangential strain
rate for the unity Le case, production and destruction of the surface
area by flame propagation are significantly increased for the unity Le
case due to the enhanced flame displacement speed. The results showed
that the stretch factor increase due to thermodiffusive instabilities is
more pronounced in turbulent flames compared to laminar ones. As
mentioned by the authors, this has a significant influence on the early
flame  kernel  development  in  ICE  and  thus  on  its  modeling.  Böttler
et al. [367] used DNS of a slot burner configuration to investigate the
ability of flamelet manifolds to capture the interactions of thermodif-
fusive instabilities and turbulence in lean H2 flames. Different flamelet
manifolds have been analyzed in terms of their capability to describe
the structure of the turbulent flame. The study highlights the impor-
tance of stretch effects in flamelet manifolds, indicating that both strain
and curvature effects need to be considered when modeling turbulent
H2 flame  structure.  Several  studies  dealt  with  including  differential
diffusion into the FGM model. Donini et al. [368] introduced additional
terms in the transport equations for progress variable, enthalpy, and
mixture  fraction,  assuming  much  larger  progress  variable  gradient
compared to the other control variable gradients. Recent studies ex-
tended this method by relaxing the assumption on the progress variable
gradient  [369] or using a mixture-averaged transport model [370].
A first attempt to incorporate thermodiffusive instabilities effect into
the TFM was proposed by Schuh et al. [371]. The authors used 2D
laminar  simulations  to  derive  a  novel  formulation  of  the  efficiency
function E solely  based  on  flame  intrinsic  characteristics.  Although
developed for laminar flames, this approach advances the use of the
TFM for H2 combustion simulation. In general turbulent combustion
models  that  assume  unity Le a  priori such  as  CFM  are  not  able  to
account for differential diffusion effects and yield inaccurate turbulent
flame speed and reaction rate determination. Nevertheless, the tuning
of  model  constants  still  permits  experimental  reference  traces  such
as  in-cylinder  pressure  to  be  met.  However,  these  results  should  be
interpreted  with  care  while  the  modeling  constants  should  be  kept
within reasonable limits. A comprehensive study of the Le influence
on the CFM model was presented by Chakraborty and Cant [372]. As
mentioned in Section 4.3, Maio et al. [128] considered the absence of
the impact of differential diffusion in the ECFM framework. They gave
detailed information on compensating for the Markstein length, which
varies  as  the  equivalence  ratio  changes,  by  adapting  the  turbulent
strain rate factor α. By applying the ISSIM [129] for ignition modeling
and autoignition delay and laminar flame speed look-up tables using
a chemical mechanism according to Xu [144], the adapted modeling
approach  was  able  to  successfully  simulate  different  engine  operat-
ing conditions for both port fuel injection and DI systems. A similar
simulation setup was applied by Rouleau et al. [145]. However, the
authors only mentioned that the ECFM model had to be adapted and
did  not  give  any  further  information  regarding  the  measures  taken.
Hernandez et al. [177] provided a comprehensive procedure to incor-
porate thermal diffusive instability effects occurring in hydrogen/air
flames into the G-equation TCI framework. The authors used modified
laminar flame speed values which take into account thermal diffusivity
based on well-resolved multi-dimensional simulations. However, they
pointed  out  that  additional  adaptions  of  the  turbulent  flame  speed
closure might be required to take into account non-unity Lewis number
effects on the turbulent flame speed, which was not part of their study.
Furthermore, the authors reported how they calibrated the simulation
based on an equivalence ratio dependency in form of the kernel radius
evolution in the ignition model and turbulent flame propagation based
on the Damköhler model [54]. Another study by Yosri et al. [179] deals
with the application of the G-equation turbulent combustion model for
a hydrogen fueled ICE. The authors used the correlation of Verhelst
et al. [180] to determine laminar flame speed tables and tuned the
modeling constant in the Damköhler turbulent flame speed model [54].
Fu et al. [181] showed a similar approach that employs the laminar
flame speed expression according to Metghalchi and Keck [142].

lower volumetric NH3, preferential diffusion effects should be consid-
ered. Chi et al. [389] investigated the effects of molecular diffusion
modeling  on  premixed  turbulent NH3/H2 flames  by  applying  DNS.
Different  diffusion  modeling  approaches  varying  in  complexity  have
been adopted indicating that while the modeling has only negligible
impact on flame structure and NO distribution conditioned on progress
variable, it still shows a notable impact on NO production speeds and
global turbulent flame speed. However, the authors further concluded
that effects of curvature and strain should be included in flamelet-based
models  to  accurately  predict  NO  emissions  and  flame  propagation.
Another fundamental investigation on NH3 flames was carried out by
Kai  et  al.  [390].  In  this  study,  the  impact  of  the  modeling  strategy
on determining the flame characteristics was investigated using highly
resoveld 2D laminar flame simulations. The authors compared several
modeling approaches namely detailed chemistry integration assuming
unite Le and considering preferential diffusion, standard FGM, FGM
considering preferential diffusion, FGM considering flame stretch and
FGM considering both preferential diffusion and flame stretch. Based
on their results, the authors concluded that considering the preferential
diffusion effect and the flame stretch effect in the FGM method was
important  to  accurately  predict  the  flame  propagating  speed  which
would be even more pronounced in turbulent flames as in ICE. A DNS
study  of  a  TJI  system  based  on H2 combustion  in  the  prechamber
to  promote  ignition  of NH3/air  mixture  in  the  main  chamber  was
conducted by Chi and Thévenin [391]. The DNS setup can be viewed
as  quasi-3D  since  the  domain  was  solely  thickened  in  the  range  of
the  orifice  width.  By  using  a  mixture-averaged  diffusion  model  and
initializing  a  homogeneous  isotropic  turbulence  field  in  the  entire
domain, the jet flow structure and the flame characteristics have been
analyzed for low pressure conditions. The simulation results underline
the requirement of the adequate modeling of thermodiffusive effects
in  such  applications  clearly  visible  in  the  highly  instable  flame  in
the  orifice  between  prechamber  and  main  chamber.  Recent  studies
have  been  published  dealing  with  the  use  of  numerical  simulation
to investigate NH3 combustion consepts in ICE. Li et al. [294] used
numerical simulation to compare low- and high pressure injection of
NH3 in DF mode using diesel pilot ignition. The authors applied the
direct detailed chemistry solver SAGE [200] using a combination of the
GRI-Mech 3.0 [119] for NH3 and an n-heptane mechanism resulting in a
464 reactions and 76 species mechanism. Although a validations based
on optical measurements of the liquid NH3 spray have been carried out
using RANS and LES, and ignition delay comparisons between engine
experiments and simulations showed good agreement, the validation
of the engine simulation setup is missing. A similar simulation setup
was presented by Frankl et al. [295] to investigate both H2 and NH3
high  pressure  DF  combustion.  The  authors  showed  a  validation  of
their simulation setup for a methane/diesel DF case, indicating good
agreement  with  experimental  data.  Applied  to H2 high  pressure  DF
combustion, the results of this simulation setup gave a deviation in the
ignition delay and a clear overestimation of in-cylinder pressure. In the
continuing step, this simulation setup was used to for investigations
on NH3 high pressure DF combustion. Although relative trends can be
derived in both studies, the validation with experimental data also for
NH3 cases would be beneficial for the assessment of the methods. Wu
et al. [221] investigated lean premixed combustion of natural gas/NH3
mixture in a prechamber engine. A reduced mechanism containing 51
species and 420 reactions was developed by combining three mecha-
nism [392–394]. To compensate for higher overall reactivity compared
to measurements, the reaction rate parameters of five reactions were
updated. Since the model validation was carried out for pure natural
gas operation, the assessment of the simulation especially for pure NH3
is limited. In contrast to the simulation validation procedures in the
aforementioned studies, Wang et al. [297] utilized simulation valida-
tion by the use of NH3/H2 measurements on a DF research engine. The
authors applied the direct detailed chemistry solver SAGE [200] with
a combination of the NH3/H2 mechanism of Otomo et al. [298] and

transport between heat and fuel species (shown for the case Le < 1). The processes
on the leading side with mostly positive curvature are assumed to be dominant for
the flame propagation process and with that for the average reaction rate, while the
processes at the rear side of the flame are assumed to affect only the burnout of the
flame and the flame brush thickness. [358].

6.2.2.  Ammonia

Ammonia  (NH3)  is  another  carbon-free  fuel  which  is  receiving
increasing attention for application in ICEs. It is an efficient hydrogen
carrier more easily transported than H2 since only moderate pressure
(9  bar)  or  moderate  cooling  (−33 ◦C)  is  required  to  liquefy NH3,
which is gaseous at standard conditions. In addition, the production
of NH3 using the Haber-Bosch synthesis is well established. However,
its  combustion  characteristics  are  not  favorable  for  application  as  a
fuel  in  ICEs:  It  has  a  large  heat  of  evaporation,  low  laminar  flame
speed, and narrow ignition limits, and it requires a large ignition energy
source. Furthermore, the corrosive, poisonous nature of NH3 leads to
difficulties in material and lubrication oil selection as well as safety
regulations. However, NH3 is increasingly applied in ICEs, which calls
for validated simulation models. Due to its low flame speed, a combus-
tion promoter is required for successful application. Most commonly,
NH3 is  partially  dissolved  into H2 and N2,  and  the H2 significantly
improves combustion behavior. From modeling perspective, however,
this adds to the difficulties as mentioned in the previous section. In
addition, the TCI of ammonia flames seems to be different compared to
CH4 [373]. The differences to natural gas also become apparent when
the H2 fraction needed to reach the same laminar flame speed and the
actual application hydrogen fraction at the engine are compared: The
former is on the order of 40% (by volume) [340,374–381] while the
latter can be as low as 10% [382–387]. One possible NH3 combustion
concept includes an active pre-chamber where a H2-rich mixture leads
to fast combustion, and the resulting turbulent jet ignites a possibly
lean NH3 mixture in the main chamber. However, this fuel variation
cannot be described by a lambda variation alone since the composition
of the fuels for the prechamber and the main chamber is different. Thus,
existing (partially) premixed, flamelet-based combustion models which
assume  that  compositions  at  any  inlet  can  be  described  by  lambda
alone need significant extensions. Fundamental research on canonical
flame  configurations  have  been  carried  out  to  investigate  the  flame
dynamics of NH3 and NH3/H2 mixtures. Gaucherand et al. [388] carried
out DNS of premixed turbulent NH3/H2 flames at different mixtures
to  investigate  effects  of  thermodiffusivity,  chemistry  and  stretch.  To
evaluate the strain sensitivity to the mixture, the respective Markstein
number was determined. Based on these values, the authors concluded
that higher volumetric NH3 content (in this case 57%) can be suffi-
ciently modeled by combustion models assuming Le = 1 whereas for

an n-heptane mechanism resulting in a 363 reactions and 75 species
mechanism. A good agreement between simulation results and experi-
mental data was shown in terms of in-cylinder pressure and heat release
rate  for  different  load  levels.  However,  insights  into  the  simulation
calibration process were not provided by the authors. Berni et al. [182]
used the G-equation approach to model combustion in a homogeneous
NH3/H2 SI engine.  Turbulent flame velocity was modeled according
to Peters [57] and laminar flame speed was obtained via correlations
according to Pessina et al. [183] and Hirasawa et al. [395] for mixture
formulation. The early flame kernel formation and growth model of
Herweg and Maly [184] was adapted by neglecting the pressure term
and using sL instead of sT. Furthermore, direct chemistry integration in
the unburned region was applied using the NH3 mechanism of Shrestha
et al. [393]. Although the authors utilized sensitivity studies to evaluate
the used sub models such for as the laminar flame speed calculation, a
validation of the NH3/H2 simulation setup is missing due to the absence
of experimental data. Novella et al. [185] also applied the G-equation
approach  to  investigate  the  combustion  process  in  a  homogeneous
NH3/H2 SI engine. While the authors reported to calculate the turbulent
flame speed according to Peters [317], the laminar flame speed was
tabulated by a 1D flamelet code using the chemical kinetic mechanism
developed by Otomo et al. [298]. This mechanism was also used for
the direct chemistry integration in the unburned region via the detailed
chemistry solver SAGE [200]. The 3D numerical simulation was used
to provide additional data for a novel virtual engine model used for the
prediction of unknown engine operating points, thus a validation of the
CFD setup by experimental data is missing.

The  literature  review  of NH3 ICE  numerical  simulation  reflects
the  novelty  of  this  topic.  While  only  a  few  works  apply  turbulent
combustion models respecting TCI, the majority uses direct chemistry
integration. Especially for TJI combustion concepts, neglecting TCI is
highly questionable. Generally, the lack of available experimental data
impede  the  validation  of  the  simulation  settings.  The  validation  of
simulation setups using different, carbon-based fuels such as methane
should be treated with care due to the diverging physical properties
of NH3. Furthermore, the consideration of preferential diffusion is of
importance especially when NH3/H2 mixtures are modeled.

6.2.3.  Methanol

Research on replacing fossil fuels with alcohol fuels such as methanol
for use in the ICE has received greater attention in recent years due to
the need for a significant reduction in the fossil carbon footprint of
transportation and energy production. The potential for using renew-
able energy to synthesize methanol from biogenic feedstocks and the
ease of storage and transportation makes it a serious candidate for a
sustainable fuel [396]. Furthermore, the high oxygen ratio and single
carbon  molecule-based  structure  yield  emission  characteristics  more
beneficial than those of complex hydrocarbon fuels. The lower volu-
metric energy content of methanol than gasoline required greater fuel
volume input into the cylinder to reach the same energy. However, the
high vaporization heat causes a significant temperature decrease and
in turn multiple positive effects in combination with the low adiabatic
flame temperature such as increased volumetric efficiency, lower wall
heat losses, lower NOx emissions and lower autoignition tendency. A
higher laminar flame speed leads to faster flame propagation and the
ability to run at a higher air/fuel ratio [396]. Methanol will play a sig-
nificant role in the field of marine engines in particular due to the ease
of fuel storage, the need for only a few modifications to existing engines
and low emissions [397]. Detailed insights into the use of methanol as
an ICE fuel are found in recent reviews [396,398,399]. With regard
to  numerical  simulation  of  turbulent  combustion,  the  integration  of
the fuel chemical kinetics by a suitable mechanism is vital to produce
accurate results. Although the reaction kinetics of the methanol air sys-
tem are well understood [396], the availability of appropriate chemical
kinetic mechanisms for engine relevant conditions is limited [398]. Due
to its preferential diffusion property similar to that of common fossil

fuels and the resulting Le in the range of unity, turbulent combustion
modeling approaches can be applied directly. However, as mentioned
by Verhelst et al. [396], only limited measurements of laminar flame
speeds  of  methanol  at  high  temperatures  and  elevated  pressure  is
available,  which  results  in  insufficient  validated  kinetic  models  and
increased error in engine simulations. Similar conclusions have been
drawn by Konnov et al. [400] who underlined the need for additional
experimental data to check the validity of existing mechanism at high
pressures. Zheng et al. [401] introduced a new correlation for methanol
laminar flame speeds based on shock tube measurements up to 916 K
and pressures ap to 2 atm. A non-Arrhenius-form laminar flame speed
correlation was constructed by fitting experimental data. The results
showed that the new model outperformed existing models especially
in the high-temperature level relevant for ICE simulations. Vancoillie
et al. [402] investigated the factors affecting the turbulent velocity of
methanol/air mixtures. After measuring the turbulent burning velocity
at  different  operating  conditions  in  a  fan-stirred  combustion  vessel,
a comparison of the most-common turbulent burning velocity models
were carried out. The results showed that the models are able to predict
the  turbulent  burning  velocity  for  the  given  operating  conditions.
Only  the  CFM  did  not  correctly  reproduce  the  correlation  between
turbulent burning velocity and u′. The authors argued that the CFM
was  developed  with  the  explicit  goal  of  engine  simulations  and  its
direct  dependence  on  flame  thickness  is  not  valid  at  the  pressures
levels  of  the  experiments  (1  bar,  5  bar).  Esposito  et  al.  [176]  gave
a comprehensive description of numerical simulation of a methanol-
fueled direct injection SI engine based on G-equation TCI. The authors
used a tabulation method based on the chemical kinetics mechanism of
Cai et al. [403] to determine the required laminar flame speed values.
To predict engine emissions, the SAGE detailed chemistry solver [200]
was activated during the entire simulation while the G-equation model
was deactivated during the last phase of combustion to obtain realistic
hydrocarbon  emissions  as  pointed  out  by  the  authors.  Furthermore,
the  calibration  process  for  the  G-equation  parameters,  spark  timing
and G-equation model deactivation timing was provided. A comparison
between experimental determined in-cylinder pressure and rate of heat
release yielded overall good agreement with the simulation delivering
a slight underestimate under all the operating conditions (see Fig. 19).
A  validation  of  measured  emission  values  also  showed  satisfactory
agreement between experiment and simulation. Li et al. [146] numeri-
cally investigated a highly stratified direct injection SI methanol engine
based on ECFM combustion modeling. The spark ignition process was
modeled by the ISSIM [129] approach. Unfortunately, the authors did
not give insights into the model calibration process and the simulation
integration  of  the  methanol  fuel  properties.  However,  the  authors
claimed good agreement between simulation and experiments in terms
of  in-cylinder  pressure  and  rate  of  heat  release  for  several  injection
timings and injection pressure levels, whereas a slight underestimate
can be identified in the simulation results. Based on the work of Li
et  al.  [146],  Leng  et  al.  [215]  used  the  direct  detailed  chemistry
solver SAGE [200] to simulate methanol combustion using a reduced
chemical kinetic mechanism according to Pichler and Nilsson [216].
The authors reported good agreement between their predictions and
the results of Li et al. [146]. Nevertheless, their conclusion that this
methodology  is  also  valid  for  a  large-bore  TJI  methanol  engine  is
questionable. Zhu et al. [217] investigated the combustion process of a
direct injection SI methanol heavy-duty engine using numerical simu-
lation. The authors neglect to model TCI and applied the SAGE detailed
chemistry solver [200] in combination with a reduced chemical kinetics
mechanism  according  to  Xue  et  al.  [218].  A  comparison  between
experimentally and numerically predicted in-cylinder pressure and rate
of heat release showed acceptable agreement. The authors further used
their model setup to investigate the in-cylinder thermodynamic state
at spark timing to draw conclusions on knock tendency depending on
different spark timings.

using  the  mechanism  of  Zhao  et  al.  [409]  showing  good  agreement
with experimental data of partially premixed flames. A similar study,
Sun et al. [410] showed that the flamelet approach is able to capture
the two-stage ignition behavior.  In terms of OMEx, Cai et al. [277]
developed one mainly used reaction mechanism for OME2−4. Based on
this mechanism, Niu et al. [290] constructed a reaction mechanism for
OME1−6. However, as stated by Lie et al. [406], only a few studies deal
with chemical kinetics mechanism with a high degree of polymeriza-
tion. Several fundamental studies have been carried which focus on the
flame characteristics of OMEx. Benajes et al. [411] used the unsteady-
flamelet  progress  variable  RANS  combustion  model  to  compare  the
flame characteristics of OME1 and OMEx with conventional n-dodecane
under ECN spray A conditions. The authors used a mechanism of Jacobs
et al. [412] for OME1 and the mechanism of Cai et al. [277] for OMEx.
The results showed that the oxygenated fuels can develop very different
flames structures compared to conventional hydrocarbons. Especially
the absence of strong low temperature ignition for the oxygenated fuels
and the effect of diffusion leading to faster ignition for OMEx compared
to n-dodecane can be highlighted. This underlines the importance of
incorporating  the  strain  rate  into  the  flamelet  calculations.  Haspel
et al. [413] used the unsteady-flamelet progress variable combustion
model  for  LES  of  spray  combustion  under  heavy-duty  conditions  to
compare the flame behavior of OME3 and OME4. The results of this
study showed that although similar local flame structures were found
for both fuels, a significant offset in the ignition delay time between
the fuels was observed. Based on these results, Bao at al. [414] pre-
sented an adapted FGM concept which includes the volume fraction
of OME3 as  an  additional  dimension  to  model OMEx spray  flames.
Since the main components of OMEx are usually OME3 and OME4 and
the  widely  adopted  mechanism  of  Cai  et  al.  [277]  is  also  designed
for  these  two  components,  the  additional  dimension  considers  the
different thermophysical properties of the fuels. LES of the ECN spray D
configuration showed that this modeling concept combined with both
the mechanism of Cai et al. [277] and Niu et al. [290] are in good
agreement with experimental results. In case of ICE application, Liu
et al. [287] numerically studied OME3/methanol blends in a CI engine
with  a  101-component  and  473-step  reaction  mechanism  integrated
into  the  simulation  with  the  SAGE  detailed  chemistry  solver  [200].
The  validation  of  the  modeling  approach  yielded  good  results  with
regard to measured cylinder pressure and NOx over a wide range of
methanol ratios. Although the study also covers soot emission results,
care  should  be  taken  in  making  statements  since  it  is  well  known
that these fuels basically generate very low soot precursors, and also
due  to  the  lack  of  a  soot  modeling  description.  Liu  et  al.  [288]
applied  a  similar  simulation  setup  to  validate  a  primary  reference
fuel/OME3/methanol/ethanol/n-butanol  mechanism  with  experimen-
tal data of a CI engine configuration. A detailed study on the ignition
and combustion characteristics of OME3−5 and n-dodecane was carried
out by Wiesmann et al. [289], who conducted numerical simulations
and  validated  the  results  with  optical  measurements  of  both  fuels
in a one-cylinder CI research engine. The OME3−5 mix was modeled
by a reduced mechanism according to Niu et al. [290].  In terms of
in-cylinder  pressure,  the  model  validation  showed  good  agreement
between simulation results and experimental data especially during the
combustion phase. Furthermore, on OH radical comparison between
the  simulation  results  and  optical  measurements  indicated  satisfac-
tory prediction of high temperature combustion locations whereas the
lift-off length was underestimated by the numerical simulation. García-
Oliver [278] presented a comparative study of several chemical kinetics
mechanism to represent diesel/OMEx blends for ICE application. While
diesel was modeled by a common n-heptane surrogate mechanism, four
different OMEx reaction mechanisms [279–282] were used in the study
whereas the integration into the numerical combustion simulation was
established with the SAGE detailed chemistry solver [200]. The authors
reported  that  only  the  compact  mechanism  by  Lin  et  al.  [281]  was
able  to  predict  behavior  similar  to  that  with  the  experimental  data

average) and simulation for all the investigated operating points (G is gasoline-like, M

6.2.4.  Synthetic fuels

In  recent  years,  the  application  of  synthetic  fuels  produced  in
renewable-driven synthesis processes as alternatives to traditional fos-
sil fuels has gained significant attention.  Dimethyl ether (DME) and
oxymethylene  ethers  (OMEx)  in  particular  appear  to  be  promising
alternatives  to  diesel  [404–406]  .  Due  to  their  favorable  carbon  to
oxygen ratio compared to diesel (and gasoline), a significant reduction
in soot emissions can be achieved. Furthermore, a high cetane number
and low boiling point result in short ignition delay times. Given the low
combustion enthalpies, however, the injected volume must be larger in
order to attain an energy input similar to diesel fuel. Comprehensive
efforts in combustion process development and thus the application of
numerical simulation are required due to the higher injection pressure
and prolonged injection duration to ensure sufficient fuel mass input
and the deviating combustion characteristics of these fuels. The major
challenge is to integrate the appropriate fuel chemistry into turbulent
combustion  simulation  since  the  general  TCI  modeling  structure  is
similar to the case of compression ignition with fossil fuels. Konnov
et al. [400] presented a comprehensive review of measurements and
data analysis of laminar burning velocities for various fuel/air mixtures
including DME. The authors showed the influence of temperature and
pressure on laminar flame speeds calculations using different reaction
mechanism. In this work, it is pointed out, that experimental studies at
elevated pressures and temperatures are very few, underlining the need
of an extension of the available data published the literature. To this
end, Shrestha et al. [407] carried out experimental laminar flame speed
measurements at elevated pressure and temperature forming the base
for the development of an appropriate DME reaction mechanism. In
case of chemistry integration via flamelet tables, Hartl et al. [408] cre-
ated DME flamelet lookup tables based on strained counterflow flames

6.3.1.  Early flame modeling

Modern  SI  ICEs  are  increasingly  adopting  lean  operation  modes
for  reasons  of  efficiency  and  emissions.  However,  these  conditions
significantly  promote  cyclic  variations  since  the  combustion  process
is  comprehensively  influenced  by  the  flow  and  mixture  conditions
around  the  spark  plug  at  ignition  timing.  The  first  choice  of  a  sim-
ulation  approach  to  capture  CCV  is  LES  since  it  is  able  to  capture
the transient behavior of large-scale turbulent eddies while small-scale
turbulent structures are modeled. Through the use of LES, the cyclic
variability of the flow field as well as the local air/fuel ratio in the
vicinity of the ignition location can be determined. Nevertheless, the
resolution of the early flame kernel development including the spark
discharge, the initial laminar flame, and the transition from laminar to
turbulent flame is typically underresolved in LES grids, hence the need
for appropriate modeling approaches. Several studies investigated the
early stage flame and the impact on CCV with optical measurements
or highly resolved numerical simulation. A frequently cited work by
Schiffmann et al. [417] analyzed the projected flame area growth and
the velocity field by PIV and OH* imaging. Having compared the data
with  the  relevant  in-cylinder  pressure,  they  reported  that  the  main
factor influencing the combustion phasing is the time an ignition kernel
requires to transit into a turbulent flame. Zeng et al. [418] analyzed
the influence of large-scale flow features on the flame initiation and
the transition to turbulent combustion using optical measurements. The
study indicates that the large-scale flow evolution plays a major role in
driving the variations in flame development for initial flame growth
and  fully  turbulent  flame  propagation.  Comprehensive  DNS  studies
to investigate early flame kernel development under engine-relevant
conditions  focusing  on  flame  kernel  area  evolution  and  differential
diffusion  impacts  have  been  carried  out  recently  by  the  combustion
group  at  RWTH  Aachen  [346–349].  A  3D  DNS  database  has  been
designed to be representative for engine conditions whereas the authors
discussed in detail the relevance of the DNS database to draw engine-
specific statements due to the required assumptions and simplifications
(constant  volume  chamber,  decaying  turbulence,  solid  wall  neglect
ion, integral length scale). The main conclusions and implications for
turbulent combustion modeling by these studies can be summarized as
follows: A major contributor to CCV in engines is flame kernel distor-
tion by large scale turbulent structures. The importance of curvature
dynamics during flame kernel development is verified by the simulation
results. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the early flame kernel
area growth is significantly reduced in Le > 1 flames.

The modeling of the early flame phase for use in ICE simulations
usually  includes  the  entire  ignition  process  and  the  transition  pro-
cess from laminar to turbulent. Well-established modeling approaches
such  as  AKTIM  [143],  the  spark  channel  ignition  monitoring  model
(SparkCIMM) [164] or DPIK [152] use Lagrangian particles to track the
ignition event and to model the flame kernel and its growth. In addition
to what is represented by the Lagrangian particles, the models differ in
terms of the criteria for when the fully developed turbulent flame is
reached (AKTIM: mass converted to combustion products, SparkCIMM:
size of Eulerian grid, DPIK: threshold based on integral length scale).
Lucchini et al. [419] developed a Lagrangian-based early flame model
coupled  with  the  ECFM  combustion  model.  Their  method  includes
detailed modeling of the ignition system including a plasma channel,
electrical circuit and restrike model, a particle evolution model and
a model that reconstructs flame surface density distribution resulting
from  particle  size  and  positions.  Flame  kernel  growth  velocity  was
determined by the heat conduction equation for real gas properties for
spark conditions. The sum of effects of flame kernel growth is grouped
into a single source term which is added to the flame surface density
transport equation. Later, Sforza et al. [420] extended the model to
account for flame stretch effects. Ravindran et al. [168] introduced a G-
equation ignition model based on the calculation of the turbulent flame
speed in the early flame phase. By adjusting the turbulent flame speed

(see Fig.  20).  A  longer  mechanism  with  a  greater  number  of  reac-
tions yielded longer ignition than the experiments. García-Oliver [276]
compared  the  combustion  process  of  conventional  diesel  and OMEx
by  numerical  simulation  whereas  n-heptane  was  used  as  the  diesel
surrogate  and OME3−4 was  represented  by  the  reduced  mechanism
according  to  Cai  et  al.  [277]  for  the  latter.  By  applying  the  SAGE
detailed  chemistry  solver  [200],  experimental  behavior  in  terms  of
in-cylinder  pressure  of  both  fuels  was  reproduced  accurately.  Fur-
thermore, detailed investigations regarding soot emission differences
between diesel and OMEx were conducted with an empirical soot model
according to Hiroyasu and Kadota [415]. The results clearly showed
the  advantages of OMEx in terms of soot  emissions  over  diesel fuel
operation. Benajes et al. [283–285] optimized the combustion system
of  a  CI  engine  operated  with  DME  using  numerical  simulation.  The
authors applied direct integration of the chemical kinetics mechanism
by ignoring TCI while choosing a reduced reaction mechanism for DME
according to Pan et al. [286]. Model validation with experimental data
indicates the accurate reproduction of the combustion characteristics
using  this  mixing  controlled  operation.  A  similar  study  was  carried
out  by  Park  [291],  who  used  numerical  simulation  to  optimize  the
combustion chamber geometry and engine operating conditions of a
CI engine fueled with DME. Ignoring TCI, the authors integrated the
chemical kinetics directly into the numerical framework. A 79-species
and 351-reactions mechanism [292,293] was applied and the adaptive
multi-grid  chemistry  model  according  to  Shi  et  al.  [416]  was  used
to reduce calculation time. As the validation with experimental data
of  three  different  start  of  injection  values  indicated,  the  modeling
approach was able to achieve satisfactorily agreement with regard to
measured in-cylinder pressure.

6.3.  Enhanced turbulent combustion modeling

Further development of ICE combustion concepts in combination
with  alternative  fuels  triggered  turbulent  combustion  modeling  re-
quirements that exceed currently available model capabilities. While
the modeling of diffusion controlled combustion is mostly covered by
existing models as well as for future fuel application, a closer look at
premixed combustion modeling is required. Since the majority of the
turbulent  combustion  models  which  have  found  their  way  into  ICE
simulation were originally developed for carbon-based fuels and, for
premixed combustion, mainly under stoichiometric conditions, it must
be proven that the model may be applied under lean or highly diluted
operating  conditions.  Furthermore,  the  interaction  between  different
fuels in DF combustion is of great interest especially for ignition pro-
motion via highly reactive fuels for slow burning fuels (e.g., NH3). The
following section addresses these two aspects.

33

S. Posch et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101200

as a function of the laminar flame thickness and the turbulence inten-
sity normalized by laminar flame speed, the authors reported better
agreement with measured flame kernel growth compared to common
G sourcing. Scarcelli et al. [421] and Kazmouz et al. [422] introduced
a hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian spark-ignition (LESI) model. Their model
uses Lagrangian particles to track the arc, an Eulerian-based energy
deposit for finite-rate chemistry models and an Eulerian-based G source
for the G-equation model. Kazmouz et al. [423] implemented the LESI
model into an LES framework and compared direct chemistry, FGM
and G-equation  combustion  models  using  numerical  simulation  of  a
direct-injection SI research engine. In terms of early flame modeling,
the authors concluded that while the LESI model yields significant im-
provements of the ignition modeling for finite-rate combustion models
compared to simple energy deposition, assuming immediate turbulent
behavior by setting a G source for the G-equation model captures less
of  the  early  flame  growth.  Thus,  the  authors  proposed  a  transition
function to ensure that early flame growth is captured. Recent studies
have  focused  on  improved  modeling  of  the  transition  from  laminar
to turbulent flame. Keum et al. [424] used a transition flame speed
determined  by  the  weighted  average  of  the  laminar  and  turbulent
flame  speeds.  The  transition  function  was  modeled  by  a  hyperbolic
tangent  function  that  introduces  two  model  constants;  it  has  to  be
calibrated according to the specific application and turbulence model.
Another approach to modeling the laminar to turbulent flame transition
was  proposed  by  Su  et  al.  [425].  Similar  to  Keum  et  al.  [424],  a
weighted  average  between  laminar  and  turbulent  flame  speeds  was
used to determine the transition flame speed but Su et al. [425] used
the Gibson scale [54] assuming that the transition process is primarily
characterized by the flame kernel size at the end of transition. Their
formulation includes a relaxation factor to take into account near wall
effects  and  one  single  parameter  for  tuning.  d’Adamo  et  al.  [337]
adapted the ISSIM model introduced by Colin et al. [129] that con-
siders the faster kernel growth rate after the glow phase by solving
unsteady  heat  conduction  and  directly  modifies Σ in  the  ECFM-LES
modeling framework. Furthermore, the spherical concept used in [129]
was adapted to accommodate the simulation of highly stretched flame
kernels and a Gaussian cumulative density function was used to take
into account the transition from subgrid-scale to fully resolved flame.
The trend of operating SI engines at highly lean or diluted condi-
tions comes along with the need for accurately modeled cyclic vari-
ations. Thanks to the significant rise in computational power over in
recent decades, LES has become standard in industrial application as
well. However, in addition to the resolution of the large-scale eddies
and thus the occurrence of some aspects of CCV [16] by the use of
LES, the modeling of the ignition process and the early flame phase
is indispensable to enable the coverage of the experimental observed
cyclic  variability  by  numerical  simulation.  Although  the  review  of
recent studies on this topic indicate significant progress has been made,
further  research  using  DNS  and  optical  measurements  under  engine
relevant conditions is required in order to advance model accuracy and
predictability.

6.3.2.  Multi-regime premixed combustion models

Regime  diagrams  are  commonly  used  to  classify  premixed  com-
bustion, cf. Section 3.3, which usually operates in the wrinkled and
corrugated  flamelet  regimes  under  stoichiometric  conditions  [426].
However, experimental and numerical studies suggest that the flame
characteristics  change  under  different  conditions  [65,427,428].  The
transition  from  flamelet  regions  to  thin  reaction  or  broken  reaction
zones  can  be  explained  by  the  Karlovitz  number K a,  which  reflects
the balance between the chemical and turbulent time scales and their
impact on the flame structure. K a increased by either increasing the
turbulence  or  decreasing  the  chemical  reaction  speed.  Both  effects
come into play in spark-ignited ICE systems. Operating at highly lean
conditions  poses  challenges  for  ignition,  but  advanced  ignition  sys-
tems  such  as  TJI  can  address  this  by  increasing  turbulent  intensity

and thus increasing K a. Previous studies of prechamber ignited ICEs
have revealed an extensive distribution of flame regimes during the
combustion process. The flame in the prechamber remains unchanged
in the thin reaction zone with D a  > 1, while the flame in the main
combustion chamber transitions from the thin reaction zone with D a <
1 to thin reaction zone with D a > 1 and eventually to the corrugated
flamelet  regime  as  shown  in Fig.  21 [66].  Similar  regime  changes
have been reported in other studies, indicating the general prevalence
of this behavior under high turbulence in TJI systems [67,153,429].
However, operation under lean conditions usually increases K a due to
the decreased laminar flame speeds, leading to a transition away from
flamelet-based regions towards regions with higher flame thickness and
eventually to unstable flame behavior [430]. An even more pronounced
dependency is observed with EGR charge dilution [427,431], where is
clearly visible with a combination of high turbulence due to TJI and
lean operation. Another factor that can cause a change of K a to higher
levels and consequently a shift of the flame regime is the use of less
reactive fuels such as NH3 as pointed out in recent studies [373,432].
A prerequisite for predictive ICE simulations is the availability of
premixed turbulent combustion models able to describe a wide range
of combustion regimes without the need for extensive model tuning.
While adaption of model parameters can enable the match between
simulation and measurement results, also for flame regimes the under-
lying model is not intended to, the use of significantly tuned models
for  predicting  deviating  operating  conditions  can  lead  to  inaccurate
results.  In  addition,  when  analyzing  flame  propagation  with  models
inappropriate for the given conditions, it is essential to consider the
potential effects of the modeling approach, even if the measurement
results appear satisfactory. An example of how tuning efforts influence
turbulent combustion simulation results is found in Kim et al. [433].
The authors compared turbulent combustion modeling via G-equation
as  well  as  direct  chemistry  integration  of  a  lean  burn  TJI  system.
While an accurate match between simulated and measured in-cylinder
pressure and heat release rate was not achieved for direct chemistry
integration  even  with  exhaustive  tuning  of  the  reaction  rate  multi-
plier,  G-equation  tuning  was  able  to  accurately  predict  peak  firing
pressure. However, the comparison between measured and simulated
prechamber pressure suggests that the tuned model is not able to handle
turbulent combustion conditions in the prechamber and the main cham-
ber simultaneously. Analysis of the combustion regimes shows clearly
comprehensive changes in D a and K a along with combustion duration
indicating the challenge of treating this type of combustion system with
models that assume flamelet behavior. In a similar study, Chinnathambi
et al. [434] compared the G-equation combustion model with direct
chemistry integration for diluted prechamber spark ignition systems.
Without  the  tuning  of  model  parameters,  the  authors  compared  the
simulation results with experimental data of different EGR levels. The
results indicate that the direct chemistry integration approach under-
predicts the prechamber combustion rate for all investigated EGR rates
leading  to  deviations  also  in  the  main  chamber.  In  the  case  of  the
G-equation model, both chambers are captured well up to a certain
EGR  level  while  significant  deviations  occur  during  the  jet  mixing
stage as the dilution level increases. Yu et al. [435] applied the ECFM
combustion model to investigate the gas dynamic interactions between
prechamber and main chamber in passive prechamber systems. After
detailed  analysis  of  the  occurring  combustion  regimes,  the  authors
concluded that simulating prechamber engines with available combus-
tion models requires adjustments of the model parameters in order to
accurately depict flame propagation.

In  addition  to  generating  accurate  results  over  a  wide  range  of
flame regimes without the need for extensive tuning, a good turbulent
combustion  model  should  keep  the  computational  effort  within  rea-
sonable limits and should ideally be compatible with RANS and LES
turbulence modeling. Models which are not strictly formulated on the
flamelet assumption such as TFM may be advisable whereas a RANS
formulation is not valid. Furthermore, modeling approaches which do

not take TCI into account are not able to represent the theoretical flame
behavior unless the grid resolves eddies at a Kolmogorov scale, which
is not feasible in engine simulations. Future research must focus on
turbulent combustion models able to deal with the entire range of ICE
premixed combustion regimes. Therefore, detailed investigations of the
flame structure occurring in ICEs and subsequently the combination of
theoretical and experimental research are required [72].

6.3.3.  Multi-mode/mixed-mode combustion

To  characterize  the  combustion  process  in  modern  ICE  concepts,
the  strict  classification  into  premixed  or  non-premixed  combustion,
diffusion or propagating flame is not straight forward and may even
be impossible. The occurrence of comprehensively stratified lean com-
bustion with advanced ignition concepts or DF concepts which incor-
porates  fuels  with  pronounced  deviating  chemistry  properties  places
great  demands  on  turbulent  combustion  modeling.  Furthermore,  the
transition from one mode to another is not strict and especially can
be  highly  significant.  While  multi-mode  combustion  models  such  as
the ECFM3Z address a certain range of combustion modes, other at-
tempts  focus  on  an  adaptive  application  of  appropriate  models.  To
implement adaptive model selection, the following three model needs
must  be  met:  (i)  a  robust  method  that  distinguishes  between  com-
bustion modes, (ii) a turbulent combustion model for each identified
mode,  and  (iii)  a  method  that  describes  mode  interactions  [309].
Several studies identify the occurring combustion regimes as premixed,
non-premixed or multi-mode. Early works used a flame index which

generally considers the alignment of fuel and oxidizer gradients [436–
438].  Knudsen  and  Pitsch  [439]  proposed  the  combination  of  the
local chemical source term, molecular mixing and unsteady terms to
identify  combustion  regimes.  To  overcome  the  drawback  of  relying
on simulation-based values for combustion regime identification, Hartl
et al. [440,441,441] introduced a gradient-free identification method
which can be used for experimental as well as simulation data. Fur-
ther  developments  of  this  method  allow  the  importance  assessment
of  the  relevant  regime  [442]  as  well  as  the  local  differentiation  of
the  combustion  regime  characteristics  [443].  While  several  studies
showed the successful implementation into ICE application of the flame
index method [444,445], the field of application of the gradient-free
identification  method  has  been  limited  to  benchmark  flame  studies.
Furthermore, Wang and Zhang [446] introduced a regime diagram for
multi-mode flames based on mixing parameter.

Several attempts to model multi-mode combustion based on flamelet-
based models have been presented in recent years. These methods are
usually based on a 2D formulation of the flamelet solution rather than
a  1D  formulation  which  uses  mixture  fraction Z for  non-premixed
and  progress  variable c for  premixed  flames.  Methods  using  a  2D
flamelet  formulation  that  combine  mixture  fraction  with  a  progress
variable  [447,448],  conditioning  reaction  progress  parameter  [309,
439] or enthalpy [449] have demonstrated their potential in several
cases. However, these models have not found their way into ICE turbu-
lent combustion simulation since an additional equation is required to
close the progress variable gradient [450] and the complexity of solving
the 2D flamelet formulation is significantly higher than with the 1D

35

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101200

counterpart. To overcome this drawback, a formulation using a set of
orthogonal coordinates based on the mixture fraction gradient and the
progress variable gradient was introduced [451] as well as a derivation
in  which  the  gradient  of  the  generalized  progress  variable  vanishes
for asymptotically non-premixed combustion. The result is a 1D for-
mulation [452]. Since the referred works are solely based on flamelet
assumption, it may only be applied to a flamelet combustion regime.
Since  transported  PDF  do  not  rely  on  any  restrictions  with  regard
to  flame  regime  or  their  applicability  with  both  premixed  and  non-
premixed combustion, their application with multi-mode combustion
is a feasible option proven by recent studies on inhomogeneous flame
setups.  The  proposed  approaches  use  either  Lagrangian  [453,454]
or Eulerian [455] stochastic methods for solving the PDF equations.
As  already  stated  in  Section 4.6,  however,  an  appropriate  mixing
model  is  required  whereas  an  LES  formulation  usually  relies  on  the
multiple  mapping  conditioning  approach  [456,457].  To  reduce  the
computational effort involved in solving the transported PDF equations,
Rieth  et  al.  [458]  introduced  a  hybrid  formulation  for  multi-mode
combustion modeling using flamelet models and transported PDF. The
authors proposed a mixture fraction criterion for switching between the
two methodologies. In the case of DF combustion, which is a classical
example of multi-mode/mixed-mode combustion, several attempts to
model flame propagation from the pilot spray into the lean background
gas  by  direct  chemistry  integration  have  been  published  [459,460].
However, as pointed out by Zhou et al. [461], the TCI effects should
be considered properly in order to accurately predict turbulent spray
flames.  Recent  promising  approaches  deal  with  the  combination  of
different combustion models to accurately simulate the different stages
of DF. Soriano et al. [462] proposed to use CMC to describe autoignition
of the fuel spray and G-equation approach to describe the subsequent
flame propagation. Their coupling scheme ignites the G-equation solu-
tion based on the solution of the CMC solution which in turn responds
to  the  pressure  rise  caused  by  the  flame  propagation  using  the  G-
equation  model.  Perini  et  al.  [463]  introduced  a  DF  model,  which
decides what regions of the combustion chamber should be simulated
with either approach according to the local flame state. In the regions
where a premixed front is not present, the direct chemistry approach
is applied acting as a ‘‘kernel’’ model for the G-equation model.

It can be concluded from the overview of recent studies that re-
search on multi-mode combustion models is ongoing and still on an
academic level since the field of application of the proposed methods
is limited to benchmark flame cases. The usability in ICE simulation
cases has to be proven in terms of accuracy as well as computational
effort. As already stated in Section 6.3.2, the suitability of flamelet-type
models must be proven in advance by identifying the correct combus-
tion regime especially under high turbulence conditions and/or slow
chemistry fuels for flamelet-based multi-mode combustion modeling as
well. Since one potential field of application of multi-mode models is
DF combustion, future research on multi-fuel coverage is necessary.

6.4.  Machine learning integration

Machine learning (ML) may be integrated into the turbulent com-
bustion simulation process in different ways and modeling stages. Gen-
erally, the combination of ‘‘classic’’ physical modeling and data-driven
methods  targets  the  increase  in  accuracy,  computation  acceleration,
or  decrease  in  memory  requirement,  or,  in  an  optimum  case,  the
interaction of all benefits. As most of the methods recently presented
address general combustion applications and thus are not specifically
dedicated  to  the  ICE,  the  following  overview  provides  insight  into
recent  works  in  this  field  as  well  as  an  outlook  proposing  how  ICE
combustion  simulation  might  benefit.  A  detailed  explanation  of  the
individual ML methods is not included at this point and the interested
reader is referred to the relevant literature.

6.4.1.  ML for chemistry integration

As mentioned above, the integration of the combustion chemistry
into  the  modeling  framework  gives  rise  to  comprehensive  computa-
tional demands if detailed mechanisms are used especially for complex
fuels.  Common  techniques  such  as  the  directed  relation  graph  with
error propagation and sensitivity analysis [464] enable the develop-
ment  of  a  reduced  kinetic  mechanism.  However,  a  reduced  kinetic
mechanism may still contain remarkable numbers of species and re-
actions represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE).
Another approach to decreasing computational demands for chemistry
calculation is the a priori generation of look-up tables which comes with
the  drawback  of  comprehensive  memory  requirements.  These  issues
may be overcome by with ML methods. Alqahtani and Echikki [465]
introduced a strategy for distinguishing between representative species,
which  are  modeled  by  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN),  and  the
remaining  species,  which  are  represented  by  a  compact  chemistry
model. The species classification is made by using principal component
analysis (PCA). Furthermore, the approach can be trained with data
generated by fast models such as 0D reactor models. Sharma et al. [466]
used ANN to represent the hydrogen oxidation reaction. The authors
employed  jointly  trained  sub-networks  to  represent  each  desired  re-
action quantity and regularization techniques in the loss function to
decrease the impact of model parameters of minor importance. After
testing their approach on several test cases, they concluded that there is
a potential for stabilization problems in time series integration. Barwey
et al. [467] proposed a combination of clustering and reaction source
term regression. DNS data were used that were clustered by combustion
regimes.  Since  one  ANN  was  trained  for  each  identified  cluster,  the
resulting  classification  served  as  the  basis  for  reaction  source  term
regression. It was concluded that inclusion of physical constraints in
the  ANN  might  lead  to  higher  accuracy.  Although  this  method  was
originally  developed  for  a  rotating  detonation  combuster  using  DNS
data, its transfer to ICEs that adopt combustion regime identification
via LES might accelerate RANS simulations. Ihme et al. [468] applied
ANNs  to  chemistry  representation  via  a  flamelet  solution  based  on
progress variable approach. The pre-generated flamelet solutions were
stored  in  a  structured  table  used  for  training  an  ANN.  Results  of
the  ANN  integration  into  LES  of  a  bluff-body  swirl-stabilized  flame
indicated  good  agreement  with  experimental  data.  The  authors  also
reported a reduction in memory of the data-driven method compared
to tabulation by a factor of 5000. Chatzopoulos and Rigopoulos [469]
proposed  chemistry  tabulation  based  on  rate-controlled  constrained
equilibrium (RCCE) and ANNs. RCCE is based on a scale separation
of  fast  and  slow  species  to  reduce  the  chemical  mechanism.  With
the reduced formulation, flamelet solutions are generated via 1D non-
premixed laminar flames which form the training base for the ANN
which is then used in numerical simulation. Based on this work, Franke
et al. [470] expanded the flamelet space to account for flame extinction
and  re-ignition  as  well.  The  authors  pointed  out  that  the  flamelet
tabulation approach is  only an intermediate  step to sample a set of
compositions. Since the compositions are shuffled before training, the
flamelet structure is lost. The integration of flamelet-based ANNs into
LES of an ICE was demonstrated by Owoyele et al. [471] who compared
two different ANN approaches: (i) all species are predicted by one ANN,
and  (ii)  correlated  and  dissimilar  species  are  predicted  using  differ-
ent ANNs. Since the second approach had better results for constant
volume  spray  simulations,  it  was  chosen  for  LES  simulation  of  a  CI
engine. The validation of the results with experimental data yielded a
slight over-prediction of in-cylinder pressure and start of combustion,
which  the  authors  argued  may  also  result  from  boundary  condition
uncertainties. However, they reported significant reduction in memory
requirements and CPU speed-up compared to with look-up tables as
shown in Fig. 22. Ranade and Echekki [472,473] modeled the joint PDF
of the thermochemical state with PCA and kernel density estimation. It
was parameterized with an ANN trained on instantaneous temperature
and  species  measurements.  Their  work  covered  both a  priori and a

modeled. The deep learning model was trained with DNS data whereas
the  filtered  progress  variable  served  as  an  input  value.  The  authors
stated that the sole use of the progress variable is as an input, and
the  networks  should  also  perform  well  for  any  turbulent  premixed
flames characterized by combustion regions near the conditions used
for training. The reconstruction of LES subgrid-scale mixture fraction
turbulent  flux  and  subgrid-scale  Reynolds  stresses  by  generative  ad-
versarial networks (GAN) was shown by Bode et al. [479]. Through
the use of sophisticated training strategies as well as physics-informed
loss  functions  based  on  the  continuity  equation,  good  results  were
achieved in a benchmark spray simulation case. The authors pointed
out the great potential of this method but also stressed the challenge
of its application to reactive scalar fields since source terms depend
on  the  smallest  scales  for  fast  chemistry,  which  must  be  predicted
correctly.  They  recently  showed  that  their  framework  is  able  to  ac-
curately  reproduce  DNS  data  of  a  fully  turbulent,  engine-like  flame
kernel on a much coarser grid [480]. Nista et al. [481] also used GAN
as  a  super-resolution  technique  to  establish  a  subfilter-scale  closure
model for unresolved stress and scalar-flux tensor. This work mainly
focused on the generalization ability of the data-driven model in terms
of Re, K a and YO H .  The  results  of  different  benchmark  flame  cases
showed good extrapolation capability whereas the author underlined
the importance of not changing the ratio of filter width to Kolmogorov
scales between training and testing conditions. Chen et al. [482] pre-
dicted  joint  FDF  of  mixture  fraction Z and  progress  variable c via
ANNs. The authors used DNS data of moderate or intense low-oxygen
dilution (MILD) combustion to train the data-driven model for the a
priori estimation of the conditioned mean reaction rates. They further
applied PCA for outlier removal in the training data to achieve better
training results. It was shown that the ANN was able to capture the FDF
characteristics  with  high  accuracy.  However,  the  authors  mentioned
the  great  challenge  to  apply  pre-calculated  data  to  a  postiori  LES
for  the  investigated  combustion  mode.  Chung  et  al.  [483]  proposed
an  ML-based  strategy  to  model  turbulent  combustion.  This  strategy
does  not  target  modeling  terms  of  a  specific  equation  or  model  but
rather chooses the appropriate combustion model using a random forest
classifier dynamically. The ML model was trained on LES data, adopting
the  local  combustion  model  error  in  the  form T and YCO.  Six  local
thermo-physical quantities were selected to construct the input feature
vector.  The  authors  reported  a  20%  computational  cost  saving  over
LES  with  direct  chemistry  integration. Fig.  23 shows  their  method
applied to a rocket combustor. This methodology is also very interesting
for ICE combustion simulation. The treatment of operating conditions
which promote changing combustion regimes, e.g., TJI combined with
a lean mixture, can benefit in terms of accuracy and computational
demands if individual combustion models are applied according to their
capabilities.

The overview of selected studies on this topic as well as the re-
view  article  by  Ihme  et  al.  [484]  indicate  the  potential  of  machine
learning integration on a combustion model level. It was discovered
that  the  majority  of  the  models  focus  on  reconstructing  unresolved
subgrid/subfilter terms in LES. This involves training with higher re-
solved  data  usually  from  DNS  or  rarely  from  measurements.  Hence,
the  models  have  been  mostly  developed  and  tested  on  benchmark
flame simulation cases. The transfer of these models to ICE turbulent
combustion  simulation  is  not  straight  forward  and  will  be  part  of
future research. Similar considerations hold for ML-based identification
of combustion regimes to dynamically apply appropriate combustion
models. The selection or generation of data for training such models is
critical to their success, which is even more pronounced in applications
beyond benchmark cases.

7.  Summary

The present review attempts to provide a holistic view of turbulent
combustion models for application in ICE numerical simulations. By

posteriori evaluation of the method in a RANS framework of several
benchmark flame cases.

The studies discussed above are only a sample of the works avail-
able on this topic. Further insights are given in the review of Zhou
et al. [474]. The application of these methods in turbulent combustion
simulation of ICEs is rarely found but will certainly increase in the near
future. Nevertheless, the following should be noted before ML is used
for chemistry integration in ICE simulations: Data-driven models such
as ANNs are a type of blackbox which do not (or hardly) provide any
information on how the final model output is generated. Unlike pure
physics-based modeling approaches, transparent reconstruction of the
path from output to input cannot be performed. Thus, comprehensive
investigations of model inaccuracies should be carried out a priori to
prevent that the wrong conclusions are drawn from simulation results.
Furthermore,  the  quality  of  data-driven  model  predictions  strongly
depends on the data used for training. Since the extrapolation capa-
bilities are not available with these models, correct representation of
the desired data range in the training data must be guaranteed. In the
case of ICEs, the ML model must cover the relevant temperature and
pressure ranges of the investigated operating conditions. To deal with
the issue of missing extrapolation capability, so-called hybrid methods
which combine data-driven and physics models (e.g., physics-informed
neural networks [475]) may be beneficial. In a recent study, Zhang
et al. [476] showed the ability to use physics-informed neural networks
for  solving  combustion  reaction  kinetics  by  integrating  the  required
ODEs into the loss function of an ANN.

6.4.2.  ML on model level

A promising strategy for integrating ML into turbulent combustion
simulation involves the replacement or modeling of individual terms
of  the  underlying  governing  equations  as  well  as  the  reconstruction
of  turbulent  combustion  model  parts.  However,  a  majority  of  the
published  studies  have  focused  on  LES  subgrid  term  reconstruction.
Lapeyre et al. [477] proposed the modeling of the flame surface density
Σ on a subgrid-scale level in LES based on progress variable c using
convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  trained  on  DNS  data.  Since
the  proposed  approach  yielded  good  agreement  between  the  CNN
prediction and baseline data, the authors concluded that the work is
a proof-of-concept for reformulating subgrid-scale combustion model
via  ML  methods.  Seltz  et  al.  [478]  introduced  another  LES  subgrid-
scale source reconstruction with CNNs that models the filtered progress
variable  source  term  and  the  unresolved  scalar  transport  term  are

explaining the fundamental aspects of turbulent combustion in terms of
different combustion regimes and their occurrence in ICEs, the authors
have categorized the individual model approaches according. Building
on this basis, the derivation of several turbulent combustion modeling
concepts with respect to ICE simulation gives comprehensive insight
into  the  topic  and  provides  a  valuable  overview  for  both  inexperi-
enced engineers and well-versed scientists. Furthermore, it forms the
foundation for a review of recent ICE turbulent combustion simulation
applications, whose main modeling aspects, parameter tuning efforts
and validation results have been discussed. The article has covered a
wide range of combustion concepts in order to address the majority
of  the  ICE  community.  Yet  as  the  ICE  is  currently  undergoing  one
of  the  most  significant  revolutions  in  its  history  away  from  carbon-
based fuels such as diesel and gasoline towards renewable, carbon-free
fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia, turbulent combustion modeling
has  to  be  improved  in  parallel.  Since  most  of  the  available  mod-
els  were  developed  with  a  focus  on  carbon-based  fuels  combustion,
model adaptations and further development efforts are required. One
example is the consideration of differential diffusion when hydrogen
is  the  primary  fuel.  Furthermore,  future  research  will  focus  on  the
capability of turbulent combustion modeling to ensure high accuracy
over  a  broad  range  of  combustion  regimes  and  combustion  modes.
Illustrative  examples  of  these  requirements  can  be  found  in  the  use
of  ammonia  as  the  primary  fuel  in  combination  with  TJI  or  diesel
pilot injection. Another field of interest for future research activities
is the smart integration of ML techniques into numerical simulation to
achieve higher accuracy and/or fewer computational demands. In the
field of turbulent combustion simulation, several studies have proven
that ML can significantly impact the integration of chemistry. Several
attempts to use ML to enhance turbulent combustion simulation from
a  modeling  perspective  have  shown  promising  results.  Nevertheless,

further research on this field is needed to detect useful applications
and develop generalizable methods. To sum up, research on turbulent
combustion models especially for use in ICE simulations will be highly
relevant  and  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  sustainable  ICE
solutions.
