Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plays an important role in waste treatment systems through- 
out the world, due to the advantages of fast volume reduction by 80–90%, heat recovery, and power 
generation. However, waste-to-energy (WtE) plants have low electrical eﬃciency of 15–25%, due to the 
low steam temperature and pressure used in order to minimize boiler deposition and corrosion problems. 
Undoubtedly, the high Cl-content in MSW is the reason for the severe corrosion problem. Chlorine also 
forms volatile compounds with trace metals (e.g., Zn, Pb), and, inﬂuences the fate of other key elements, 
e.g., Na, K, and S. 

Different from alkali metals in biomass, which have been thoroughly investigated, the behavior of 
chlorine during MSW incineration has not been systematically and comprehensively studied. Up until 
now, there are few in-depth studies that have been conducted on the thermal behavior of chlorine or on 
the remedial measures against Cl-induced problems. An up-to-date review on the behavior of chlorine 
from incineration via freeboard chemistry to corrosive attack is therefore needed, in order to provide 
knowledge on process optimization and reactor design, thereby enabling high-eﬃcient energy utilization 
and safe operation of large-scale WtE units. 

This  review  provides  a  critical  summary  of  the  progress  of  research  on  chlorine  in  MSW  (ori- 
gins, species, and analytical methods); the thermal behavior of chlorine, including chlorine vaporization, 
aerosol formation and transformation (freeboard chemistry), deposit formation, and Cl-initiated corrosion 
mechanisms. In addition, the interrelationship of chlorine with other key elements (S, Na, K, Zn, Pb), and, 
the chlorine roadmap in the incineration process is presented, along with the inﬂuence of feedstock com- 
position and the temperature of both the ﬂue gas and boiler tube metal on chlorine-induced deposition 
and corrosion. 

Mitigation measures against Cl-initiated problems such as Segher boiler prisms, mixed secondary air 
injection, and eco-tube systems, are also thoroughly discussed. Finally, challenges and further research 
questions, are identiﬁed.

1. Introduction 

Due  to  the  increase  in  population  size,  rapid  economic  de- 
velopment,  and  urbanization,  the  rate  of  municipal  solid  waste 
(MSW) generation has drastically increased [1] . In the EU-28 mem- 
ber states,  approximately  875.2 million tons of  waste were gen- 
erated in 2010, an amount which increased to 890.8 million tons 
of waste in 2014 [2] .  In the US,  MSW-generation was estimated 
at 243.5 million tons in 20 0 0 and 254.1 million tons in 2013 [3] . 
In  China,  the  MSW  generation  has  increased  substantially,  from 
178.6  million  tons  in  2014  to  204  million  tons  in  2015  [4] ,  and 
it is projected that China’s annual amount of MSW will be close 
to  282  million  tons  by  2020  [5] .  According  to  the  1999/31  EC 
European  Landﬁll  Directive,  all  EU  member  states  were  forced 
to  reduce  the  quantities  of  organic  wastes  that  were  landﬁlled 
to  35%  of  the  quantities  landﬁlled  in  1995,  by  the  year  2016 
[2] .  Some  countries  have  already  achieved  the  stipulated  target 
to reduce the dependence on waste landﬁlls, with Sweden, Ger- 
many, the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, and Belgium, as the most 
successful  candidates.  In  China,  due  to  depleting  land  resources, 
the  13th  ‘‘Five-Year  Plan” enacted  in  2016,  which  requires  con- 
struction of harmless municipal waste disposal facilities, actively 
encourages  safe  waste  treatment  and  disposal  methods,  shifting 
thereby  away  from  landﬁll  technology  [6] .  As  a  result,  the  in- 
cineration  of  MSW  in  waste-to-energy  (WtE)  plants  have  been 
considered  as  the  major  method  for  sustainable  waste  manage- 
ment and safe disposal of residual waste due to its advantages of 
fast volume reduction by ∼90%, and potential electricity and heat 
recovery [5] . 

Currently, approximately 220 million tons of MSW are treated 
globally  in  over  800  WtE  plants  [7] .  Data  show  that  the  total 
energy  produced  globally  from  municipal  wastes,  in  2010  was 
41.743 GWh,  while  in  2015,  it  had  increased  to  62.507 GWh  [8] . 
This increase in energy generation indicates that the combustion 
of MSW in WtE plants has drawn increasing focus and attention. 
Aside from generating energy, WtE plants have the beneﬁt of low- 
ering greenhouse gas (GHG) CO 
2 emissions per unit of coal substi- 
tuted, since waste fractions are largely biogenic ( ∼70% combustible 
organics content) [9–11] . In 2007, the worldwide impact on climate 
change from waste incineration in WtE-facilities was estimated at 
40 million tons CO 
2 -eq for 
waste landﬁlling, and in 2015, it was estimated at 60 million tons 
2 for landﬁlling [10] . With 
CO 
the policy of diverting waste from landﬁlls towards incineration, it 
is expected to reduce 92 million tons CO 
2 -eq/year by 2030, which 
is 8% of 1137 million tons CO 
2 -eq predicted to be reduced by 2030 
[12] .

MSW commonly includes domestic waste (waste generated in 
homes), commercial waste, and institutional waste [13] . According 
to Directive 2008/98/EC Article 3(1), waste is deﬁned as any ob- 
ject or substance which the owners throw out or intend to discard. 
Generally, MSW is composed of food waste ( ∼25–70%), paper, plas- 
tic, metal, glass, textiles, wood, rubber, leather, and other materi- 
als [14] . The typical elemental composition of MSW components is 
shown in Table 1 . From the data, plastics, particularly PVC and food 
wastes, are the major sources of Cl, i.e., organic-Cl and inorganic- 
Cl,  respectively  [15] .  Organic  chlorides  have a  lower  binding en- 
ergy of 397 kJ/mol in PVC than inorganic Cl, such as NaCl and KCl,

which have binding energies of 787 kJ/mol and 717 kJ/mol, respec- 
tively  [15] . When  PVC  is  incinerated,  it  begins  to  release  HCl  at 
temperatures between 200  °C and 360  °C [16] and completely de- 
composes at temperatures approximately 550 °C [17] . KCl and NaCl 
in MSW materials volatilize at temperatures approximately 800  °C 
and partly transform into HCl [18] . HCl undergoes thermal decom- 
position at temperatures up to 600 °C in an oxidizing environment 
via the Deacon reaction, thereby forming molecular Cl 
2 [19] . Some 
species that exist in the incineration chamber, such as SOx, facili- 
tate the formation of HCl from inorganic chlorides (NaCl and KCl), 
either homogeneously in the gas phase [20] or heterogeneously in 
the deposit [21] . Additionally, other inorganic species, e.g., SiO 
2 and 
Al 
3 , play a fundamental role in the conversion of inorganic chlo- 
rides to HCl [22] . Meanwhile, the mechanism of the vaporization 
of chlorine from waste fractions and its thermal behavior during 
MSW incineration is not clearly understood.

Compared  with  coal-ﬁred  power  plants,  the  incineration  of 
MSW  lead  to  severe  deposition  and  corrosion  problems,  which 
causes  WtE-plants  to  operate  at  rather  low  steam  temperatures 
and pressures, therefore reaching only 15–25% electrical eﬃciency 
[15,29] .  Experience  from  a  Swedish  WtE-plant  revealed  that  su- 
perheater materials made of low-Cr ferritic alloys, need to be re- 
placed after ∼20,0 0 0 h of operation due to corrosion that dete- 
riorates superheater materials, if the WtE-plant is operated with 
a  steam  temperature  >  470  °C  [30,31] .  Recently,  a  WtE-plant  in 
Chengdu,  China  experienced  an  excessive  rupture  of  the  super- 

heater tube metals. Fig. 1 shows the corroded superheater tubes 
from  the  Chengdu  waste-to-energy  plant  which  were  replaced. 
This occurrence forced the plant to undergo an unplanned shut- 
down  for  maintenance,  causing  the  loss  of  energy  and  electric- 
ity production, as well as the treatment of wastes. Approximately 
75% of the budget for the planned shutdown was consumed in the 
maintenance of the degraded boiler tubes, during this unplanned 
downtime, resulting in a substantial economic loss. Despite this ex- 
ample, several cases of costly unplanned shutdowns of WtE-plants 
due to corrosion of boiler tubes are reported in the literature. The 
Waste  to  Energy  Research  and  Technology  Council  (WTERT)  re- 
ported that in the US, the cost of boiler maintenance due to un- 
scheduled downtime ranges from $18,0 0 0 to $1,20 0,0 0 0 ($0.23 to 
$8.17  corrosion  maintenance/ton  of  MSW  incinerated).  Ma  et  al. 
[32] analyzed the deposit chemistry from the pre-protector and su- 
perheater of a WtE–plant and found that it was rich in Cl, K, and 
Na. Hence, it was concluded that the problem is mainly induced by 
Cl-chemistry [33] . Nevertheless, the fate of chlorine and its interac- 
tions with other elements, which are the prominent cause of corro- 
sion mechanisms, are still not yet fully understood. Understanding 
the thermal behavior of chlorine from the incineration stage to the 
corrosion process, will put focus and shed light on the optimiza- 
tion of incineration processes and reactor design, being capable of 
higher electrical eﬃciency and safer operation in large-scale units. 
Chlorine  appears  in  ﬂue  gas  as  HCl,  alkali  chlorides,  and/or 
chlorides of heavy metals (Zn, Pb) [29] . These chlorides may form

deposits  on  boiler  tubes  when  the  metal  temperature  becomes 
lower than the saturation temperatures of alkali and heavy metal 
chlorides.  At  temperatures  >  450  °C,  boiler  tubes  consequently 
suffer  from  Cl-initiated  corrosion.  The  magnitude  of  these  pro- 
cesses  is  signiﬁcantly  affected  by  the  concentration  of  Cl  in  the 
waste material, the chemical association of Cl in the waste com- 
ponents,  the  boiler  design,  as  well  as  the  operating  conditions. 
In  the  incineration  chamber,  HCl  is  oxidized  to  highly  corrosive 
molecular Cl 
2 , at temperatures below 600  °C [15] . The existence 
of  chlorine  in  the  gas  phase  stimulates  the  formation  of  toxic 
products, e.g., PCDD/F, and alters the partitioning of heavy metals, 
causing thereby serious environmental pollution [34] . The combus- 
tion pattern of Cl is fuel-speciﬁc, and, is partly controlled by the 
abundance  of  other  elements  existing  in  the  boiler  [35] .  There- 
fore, the occurrence of these Cl-initiated problems is far from being 
straightforward. 

A number of potential remedies such as co-combustion [36–38] , 
the use of additives [39–42] , optimization of the combustion con- 
ditions [43–45] , and the use of advanced alloys and coatings [46–
48] have been investigated in an effort to control Cl-induced de- 
position and corrosion problems in WtE facilities. Because the fate 
of Cl, as well as the evolution of other key elements such as al- 
kali metals, heavy metals, and S, during MSW-incineration is gov- 
erned by several factors such as the feedstock composition, resi- 
dence time, temperature, ﬂue gas velocity, air supply, and furnace 
design features [19] , these measures have proved to be effective 
under one set of operating conditions but ineffective under other 
conditions, and in different types of boilers. Therefore, operational 
problems related to chlorine during the combustion of MSW, are 
still unresolved. 

Although some review papers on Cl-initiated problems during 
the combustion of solid waste exist in the literature, there is still 
no single paper which comprehensively reviews the fate of Cl and 
its  thermal  behavior  during  incineration  of  MSW  in  WtE  plants. 
Tillman et al. [49] conducted research on the behavior of Cl, during 
the combustion of coals of various ranks and origins. Their review 
focused on the forms of Cl in coal and associated reactions, de- 
position, and corrosion. They clearly mentioned that MSW and its 
derivatives were out of the scope of their paper. Because of the dif- 
ferences in properties and contaminants between coal and MSW, 
their  results  could  not  apply  to  the  case  of  MSW-incineration. 
Everaert  and  Baeyens  [50]  focused  mainly  on  the  formation  of 
polychlorinated  dioxins  and  furans,  which  are  out  of  the  scope 
of  the  present  paper.  Niu  et  al.  [51]  reviewed  ash-related  prob- 
lems, during the combustion of biomass. The authors presented a 
number of issues, including deposition and corrosion, along with 
mitigation measures such as co-combustion and biomass pretreat- 
ment/washing. However, pure biomass differs from MSW, in that 
it  contains  higher  concentrations  of  alkali  metals,  while  MSW 
contains heavy metals such as Zn and Pb in large amounts. Some 
reactions that occur in the case of MSW, may not take place during 
pure biomass combustion, particularly the interaction of Cl with 
heavy metals (Zn and Pb). Moreover, a number of aspects such as 
the vaporization of Cl and alkali metals, the interaction of Cl with 
S, and transport mechanisms, were completely missing from that 
review. Lu et al. [52] reviewed the concentrations of Cl in MSW, 
Cl-emission behavior during MSW-incineration, dioxin formation, 
and  methods  for  controlling  the  emission  of  Cl.  While  attempts 
have been made to provide a summary of Cl-behavior during the 
combustion  of  solid  fuels,  the  studies  have  greatly  focused  on 
corrosion, emissions behaviors, and dioxins and furan formation, 
yet the full road map of Cl from the Cl in waste to its vaporization, 
transportation,  interaction  with  other  key  elements,  deposition, 
and  corrosion  process  and  potential  remedies  for  these  issues 
have,  to  date,  still  not  been  systematically  and  comprehensively 
studied. 

Research on the thermal behavior of chlorine during the com- 
bustion of MSW, which is rich in heavy metals, is urgently needed. 
This paper critically reviews the research advances in; 

1 Chlorine in MSW (origins, species, and analytical methods); 
2 the thermal behavior of chlorine, including chlorine volatiliza- 
tion, aerosol formation and transformation, deposits formation, 
and chlorine-originated corrosion mechanisms; 

3 interrelationships  with  other  key  elements  (S,  Na,  K,  Zn,  and 

Pb); 

4 the chlorine roadmap during the combustion process, in which 
the inﬂuencing factors such as the feedstock composition and 
temperature  of  both  the  ﬂue  gas  and  surface  metal  are  dis- 
cussed in detail, 

5 mitigation measures for chlorine and associated corrosion prob- 

lems, are also discussed in detail. 

Finally, challenges and hot spots for further research are iden- 
tiﬁed and presented. During the performance of this review, ap- 
proximately 90% of the published papers, book chapters, and con- 
ference papers dating back to 1995 were used, while approximately 
10% of other relevant materials dating farther back were also con- 
sidered. 

2. Chlorine in waste 

Most Cl-containing products are disposed as MSW after their 
lifetime, and consist of different components with different chem- 
ical compositions, which lead to different incineration character- 
istics. Many studies have examined whether the total Cl-content 
(TCC)  in  waste  is  of  importance  for  high-temperature  corrosion, 
while  recent  research  has  tended  to  identify  the  correlation  be- 
tween chlorine input and Cl-associated problems. In order to deter- 
mine the TCC, which is inﬂuenced by various Cl-containing com- 
ponents,  one  must  identify  the  main  components  in  MSW  and 
subsequently  characterize  them  individually.  The  TCC  can  then 
be  calculated  by  multiplication  of  the  chlorine  concentration  of 
each component, by its weight percentage. This section presents 
the researches and improvements in the ﬁeld of chlorine origins 
and chlorine species. Potential aspects concerning further develop- 
ments are also indicated. 

2.1. Chlorine origins 

Chlorine is considered one of the critical parameters in future 
classiﬁcation  systems  for  refuse-derived  fuel/solid  recovered  fuel 
(RDF/SRF) and MSW from an environmental and operational point- 
of-view. Due to the heterogeneous nature of MSW, a precise value 
of the TCC and a straightforward deﬁnition of the associated incin- 
eration behaviors are rather diﬃcult. The sorting and analysis of 
single components of MSW is useful for gathering information on 
the origins and contributions of single waste components on the 
total Cl-load, see Table 2 . 

All studies have identiﬁed plastics as main source of chlorine 
in MSW, regardless of its region. The global production capacity of 
plastic, especially polyvinyl chloride (PVC), has increased from 53 
million tons produced in 2013, to 61 million tons in 2016 [57,58] as 
a  result  of  the  growing  demand  for  PVC  from  end-segment  in- 
dustries.  Waste  materials  such  as  rubber  and  leather  have  high 
TCC, often signiﬁcantly greater than 2 wt% (dry basis), because of 
the  wide  use  of  PVC  in  shoes  and  clothes  manufacturing.  Aracil 
et al. [59] mentioned that approximately 38–66% of the chlorine 
contained in MSW, comes from PVC. As the majority of the PVC- 
containing products take a long time to decompose, approximately 
5  to  30  years,  the  Cl  contained  in  these  waste  materials,  will 
remain  present  in  signiﬁcant  amounts  for  decades  [54] .  Kikuchi 
et al. [60] suggested that plastic wastes should be pre-sorted and

grouped  into  two  categories:  1)  Cl-poor  plastics  ( ≤0.5%),  which 
should be incinerated in WtE plants, and, 2) Cl-rich plastics, which 
should be landﬁlled. Based on this classiﬁcation, 47.5 wt% Cl-poor 
plastics would go towards WtE use, while 16.9 wt% (ca 4.7% Cl con- 
tent) would go to landﬁlls, numbers which are quite different from 
the current sorting method (13 wt% WtE use and 52% landﬁll). The 
remaining  35 wt%  would  be  recyclable.  This  classiﬁcation  is  not 
only able to improve the reuse rate, and gain alternative fuels, but 
is  also  helpful  for  the  reduction  of  landﬁll  amounts.  Zhou  et  al. 
[61,62] classiﬁed MSW components using cluster analysis to deter- 
mine the thermal-chemical characteristics in WtE research. It was 
found that some components of MSW can be selected for thermal 
conversion in WtE research. 

Based  on  the  chlorine  concentration,  Schirmer  et  al.  [63]  di- 
vided waste components into three groups: 1) high-, 2) medium-, 
and 3) low-chlorine waste components. Approximately 35% of the 
components  in  MSW  have  a  chlorine  concentration  of  less  than 
0.5 wt%  (dry  basis),  such  as  composite  packaging  material,  pack- 
aging  plastics,  paper,  cardboard,  textile,  and,  wood.  Highly  chlo- 
rinated,  mainly  PVC-containing  products  with  [1.5%–10  wt%]  Cl- 
content, contribute 40% to the total Cl-content in untreated MSW, 
which includes e-waste, shoes, leather and rubber. Waste compo- 
nents with Cl-contents in the range [0.5–1.0 wt%] account for ap- 
proximately 50% of the total mass of MSW, thereby contributing 
much to the total Cl- load in MSW. 

2.2. Chlorine species 

In the environment, chlorine is mainly identiﬁed as inorganic 
chloride ions (Cl −), in salts. In relation to its occurrence in waste, 
chlorine can be classiﬁed into two pools according to its source: 
chlorine from organic waste, such as plastic, and chlorine from in- 
organic  sources,  such  as  kitchen  waste  containing  alkaline  chlo- 
ride salts (e.g., NaCl and KCl). Regarding residues remaining after 
incineration, chlorine can be divided into volatile chlorine (chlo- 
rine in gasses, such as HCl) and non-volatile chlorine (chlorine in 
ash). While inorganic and organic chlorides occur almost equally 
in MSW, the ratio of [HCl in the gas phase]-to-[chlorides remain- 
ing in the residue], is approximately 80/20 [53] . 

2.2.1. Chlorine from organic and inorganic sources 

Organic and inorganic chloride sources release chlorine at high 
temperatures, which forms HCl with hydrogen ions [22,35] . During 
incineration of MSW containing Cl, ∼72–80% of the HCl is formed 

from organic sources of Cl, such as PVC, while only 20–28% of the 
HCl is formed from inorganic chlorides (e.g., NaCl) [22] . However, 
it is not clear how the types of Cl bonds are linked to the com- 
bustibility. 

Organic-Cl compounds are characterized by C-Cl binding, which 
typically has a binding energy as low as 326 kJ/mol in PVC. Com- 
paratively, inorganic chlorides have higher binding energies due to 
ionic bonding (shown in Table 3 ). During incineration, the chlori- 
nated hydrocarbons in organic waste begin to release HCl between 
200  °C  and  360  °C  [16] ,  and  complete  HCl-release  is  achieved 
at  400  °C  [64] .  The  formation  of  HCl  is  generally  due  to  ther- 
mal decomposition, combined with depolymerization of the plas- 
tic, which is a well-known behavior of burning chlorinated hydro- 
carbons [65] : 

PVC → HCl + yC x H z 

(R1) 

yC x H z represents hydrocarbons 

2NaCl + 1/2O 2 + SO 2 + H 2 O → 2HCl + Na 2 SO 4 

(R2) 

In contrast, chlorine in inorganic waste is partly volatilized into 
the gas phase [66] according to (R2) . In addition to HCl, substantial 
amounts of NaCl and KCl, are observed in the incineration chamber 
[67] . Approximately 90% of the Cl, 33% of the K, and 10% of the Na, 
are released during the combustion of waste [68] . Yasuhara et al. 
[18] observed that NaCl volatilizes at ∼800  °C, leading to weight 
loss from the original sample. Additionally, KCl condensation was 
observed  in  cement  kilns,  along  the  ﬂue  gas  ducts.  It  has  been 
stated that the chlorine recovery from kitchen wastes, decreases 
when the incineration temperature increases [55] , which is prob- 
ably  due  to  interaction  with  SO 
2  in  a  sulfation  process.  Kanters 
et al. [53] conducted experiments to investigate how NaCl is trans- 
formed into HCl, and concluded that the conversion depends on 
the NaCl input, the combustion time, the humidity, and the con- 
tents of SiO 

2 and other oxides. 

Wang et al. [22] reported that transformation of NaCl into HCl 
occurred to lesser extend than formation of HCl from PVC, and that 
the temperature played an important role in the formation of HCl 
from both NaCl and PVC. Wey et al. [69] studied the formation of 
Cl 
2 and HCl, using artiﬁcial feedstocks (PVC and NaCl), mixed with 
different additives, in a ﬂuidized bed incinerator. When PVC was 
2 were formed, while when NaCl was added, 
combusted, HCl and Cl 
both NaCl and HCl were detected. HCl formation increased with

increasing temperature, and was independent of the Cl-source. The 
formation constants (Kp) of HCl from different inorganic chlorides 
are shown in Table 4 , which indicate that chloride can readily form 
HCl,  as  the  equilibrium  constant  becomes  larger,  while  less  HCl 
is formed, when the equilibrium constant becomes smaller, even 
at higher temperatures. Furthermore, Wey et al. [70] employed a 
lab-scale ﬂuidized bed incinerator to explore the relationship be- 
tween chlorine forms and emission. They found that inorganic-Cl 
generated lower concentrations of HCl than organic-Cl. The HCl- 
concentration  slightly  increased  from  10 ppm  to  50  ppmv,  when 
inorganic chlorides were used, while it signiﬁcantly increased from 
50  ppmv  to  20 0 0  ppmv,  when  an  organic  source  was  used  as 
the feedstock. The authors explained that the lower emissions of 
Cl 
2 and HCl when using inorganic chloride feedstock, was due to 
the incomplete decomposition of NaCl at the tested temperature, 
which therefore allowed some Cl to remain in the bottom ash, or, 
even  more  likely,  due  to  the  chlorine  released  from  NaCl  being 
slower to react with hydrogen to form HCl [70] . 

2.2.2. Chlorine in ﬂue gas and residues 

In MSW-incineration, a small amount of chlorine is still present 
in the residue and ash, in addition to HCl and volatile chlorides 
being  present  in  the  ﬂue  gas.  Therefore,  the  concept  of  “com- 
bustible chlorine and non-combustible chlorine” was ﬁrst proposed 
by Watanabe et al. [55] . In their work, a quartz furnace was used 
to combust MSW components. The combustion gas was absorbed 
by H 
2  solution, the ash on the quartz vessel was mixed with 
2 O 
3 , and ﬁnally, the chlorine content was detected. The Cl 
0.7 M HNO 
remaining in the ash, and the Cl in the gas, were termed incom- 
bustible and combustible chlorine, respectively. It was found that 
plastic  consists  of  2.05 g  combustible  chlorine/kg  raw  waste  and 
0.27 g  incombustible  chlorine/kg  raw  waste,  while  kitchen  waste 
contained  0.05  and  0.27 g  Cl/kg  raw  waste,  respectively.  Corre- 
spondingly, the average Cl-content in MSW was 3.7 g/kg, of which 
1.0 and 2.7 g/kg were incombustible and combustible, respectively. 
Combustible  Cl  and  incombustible  Cl  can  be  shown  in  reactions 
(R3) and (R4) , respectively: 

MSW-Cl = MCl(g) + HCl(g) + Cl 2 (g) 

MSW-Cl = MCl(s) 

M = Na,K 

(R3) 

(R4) 

Ma  et  al.  [15]  detected  chlorine  gas  by  coulometry.  After  in- 
cineration, the solid residue was rinsed with de-ionized water, di- 
luted to 100 ml, and analysed by ion chromatography. Very low Cl- 
content in the ash, was observed for most waste components. They 
attributed this ﬁnding to the small samples applied (approximately 
0.5 g), leading to large variations in the accuracy, concerning the 
heterogeneity characteristic of solid waste [15] . 

2.2.3. Interrelation between chlorine species 

As  shown in  Table 5 ,  four  similar but  independent investiga- 
tions, clearly suggest comparable Cl-contents in these waste com- 
ponents.  Furthermore,  as  shown  in  Table  5  and  Fig.  2 ,  the  ratio 
between non-combustible and combustible Cl-content, is also very 
similar to the ratio between inorganic and organic Cl. A correlation 
between both parameters may therefore be assumed. 

2.3. Analytical methods and observations 

It  is  vital  to  be  able  to  accurately  quantify  the  Cl  concentra- 
tions from different MSW materials, in order to address its neg- 
ative  effects  in  incinerators.  A  number  of  methods  available  for 
determining  the  Cl-content  in  different  waste  fractions,  may  be 
categorized  into  combustion,  extraction  [72,73]  or  spectroscopy 
[74] methods. The choice of a suitable analytical method for deter- 
mining the Cl-content in MSW, is dependent on the availability of 
equipment, simplicity, accuracy, Cl-species (i.e. chemical and physi- 
cal association in the fuel/sample), type of waste material, and de- 
tection limits. The analytical methods can be combined with de- 
tection/observation techniques. Numerous Cl detection/observation 
techniques are available, for example, ion chromatography (IC), X- 
ray  ﬂuorescence  (XRF),  inductively  coupled  plasma-optical  emis- 
sion  spectrometry  (ICP-OES)  or  -sector  ﬁeld  mass  spectrometry 
(ICP-SFMS), coulometry, titration, and instrumental neutron activa- 
tion analysis (INAA) [52,72–74] . Standards for chlorine quantiﬁca- 
tion have been developed and are available in the literature. The 
ﬁrst standards used to determine the total chlorine content (TCC) 
were developed for coal. Afterwards several standards were pub- 
lished by CEN for waste (CEN/TC 292) [75] , biofuels (CEN/TC 335) 
[76] and SRF (CEN/TC 393) [77] and (CEN/TS 15408:2006) [78] . In 
addition to the standard test methods, CEN/TC 335 “Solid biofu- 
els” developed a “quick test” for the analysis of water-soluble chlo- 
rine to estimate the potential of slagging and corrosion of biofuels, 
while CEN/TS 15105:2005 [79] presents a test for the determina- 
tion of the water-soluble contents of Cl, Na and K. 

2.3.1. Combustion method 

Combustion methods include tube/muﬄe furnace combustion, 
ﬂask combustion, bomb combustion, and microwave-induced com- 
bustion [15,52] , and may be used for the determination of Cl con- 
tents  in  any  combustible  waste  materials.  The  basic  principle  of 
this method is that a waste sample is combusted, and the volatile 
Cl  is  absorbed  into  an  aqueous  solution  used  for  Cl-detection, 
while  the  residue/ash  remain  in  the  combustion  chamber  [80] . 
Special monitoring should be performed for the ash content, since 
the residual ash also binds Cl. Combustion methods have the abil- 
ity to quantify the total Cl-content (TCC), due to the high tempera- 
tures ( > 10 0 0  °C) involved. Although some Cl remains in the ash 
(incombustible  Cl)  after  combustion,  the  amount  is  usually  very 
small compared to the corresponding TCC [35] . Nevertheless, if a 
tube/muﬄe furnace is used for combustion at relatively low tem- 
peratures < 10 0 0 °C, the incombustible Cl in the residue is not neg- 
ligible, and may be further quantiﬁed by other methods, such as 
water washing. Thus, the furnace method is able to speciate com- 
bustible and incombustible Cl. 

The furnace combustion of waste for the determination of chlo- 
rine  is  standardized  by  an  international  standard,  ISO  351.  The 
combustion gas, which contains combustible Cl, is absorbed into 
2 solution [80] . The ash on 
the aqueous solution, usually a 1% H 
the quartz vessel which contains the incombustible Cl, is extracted 
either  in  distilled  water  or  in  concentrated  nitric  acid.  The  con- 
centrations of combustible and incombustible Cl in the sample so- 
lutions may then be determined e.g. by IC [55] . The waste sam- 
ples should be combusted at a lower temperature approximately

600  °C, because if they are burnt at > 900  °C, deposition of Cl on 
the surface of the furnace occur due to the volatilization of alkali 
chlorides from the  sample boat  [81] . The  method for recovering 
incombustible Cl from ash residue through dissolving the ash in 
distilled water has a major drawback. Some insoluble compounds 
such as chlorinated aromatic compounds may not have degraded 
and can therefore not be recovered, thereby causing an underes- 
timate of the incombustible Cl [81] . However, the accuracy of the 
quantiﬁcation of incombustible Cl can be improved by either dis- 
solving  the  ash  residue  in  diluted  nitric  acid,  e.g.,  0.14 M  HNO 
3 , 
at room temperature or by heating the ash in more concentrated 
3 . Watanable et al. [55] used both di- 
nitric acid, e.g., 0.7 M HNO 
luted HNO 
3  at room temperature and heated concentrated HNO 
3 
to determine incombustible Cl-content in kitchen waste, and found 
that heated concentrated HNO 
3  recovered more incombustible Cl 
(11 mg/g) than diluted HNO 
3 at room temperature (6 mg/g incom- 
bustible Cl) from same amount of kitchen waste. The ﬂow diagram 
of analysing chlorine using furnace tube technology is shown in 
Fig. 3 . 

Coulometry may also be used to determine the Cl-content in 
MSW-components,  e.g.,  when  using  an  elemental  analyzer,  Cl  in 
the  gas  is  analyzed  by  the  coulometer  detector,  and  Cl  in  ash 

residue is analyzed through water washing, thereby allowing de- 
termination of the TCC. The use of an elemental analyzer is one of 
the muﬄe furnace methods, which enables determination of Cl in 
samples with a wide range of Cl-contents (30–10 0 0 μg), due to the 
sample gas splitting option [15,52] . 

The oxygen bomb method was standardized by CEN/TS 15408: 
2006, for the determination of chlorine, and the combination of 
bomb combustion with IC for the quantiﬁcation of the TCC in solid 
recovered fuels (SRF), was standardized by a European committee 
(EN 15048:2011). The high combustion temperature in the range 
[10 0 0–150 0 °C], and, the oxygen partial pressure of 30 bars ensure 
the transformation of organic bound halogen into the correspond- 
ing halogenides and their absorption into the solution. A common 
absorbent solution used with oxygen bomb combustion is 2.52 g 
Na 
2  in one liter 
of de-ionized water [15] . The solution is subsequently diluted to 
a certain volume, and the Cl concentration is analyzed by IC. The 
concentration obtained is then used to calculate the Cl-content in 
the solid samples. However, due to volatilization of alkali chlorides 
which may condense on the walls of the furnace, the combustion 
residue may deposit on the furnace, resulting in an overestimation 
of incombustible Cl [52] .

2.3.2. Extraction method 

Because some MSW materials (food waste, biomass, yard waste, 
and others) contain chlorides that are quickly and completely sol- 
uble  in  water,  an  extraction  method  was  established  to  analyze 
water-soluble Cl, i.e., inorganic Cl. Generally, an elution procedure 
is used for the extraction of inorganic Cl from leachable waste ma- 
terials, and the corresponding ﬂow diagram is shown in Fig. 4 . In 
this method, the dried sample is cut and crushed into small pieces 
of  ∼ < 25 mm,  subsequently  mixed  thoroughly  and  washed  with 
de-ionized water. The obtained mixture is ﬁltered, the ﬁltrate is 
diluted, and then the concentration of inorganic-Cl is analysed by 
IC [80] . The extracted Cl-concentration increases as the experiment 
duration is prolonged and as the temperature increases, i.e., boil- 
ing water extracts more Cl than cold water. After the elution pro- 
cedure, the dewatered sample is dried and ground, typically to a 
particle  size  of  < 1 mm,  such  that  the  insoluble  chlorides  in  the 
dried solid matter can be quantiﬁed by Schoeninger ﬂask combus- 
tion, as standardized by CEN/TS 15408:2006 [15] . Water-insoluble 
Cl that remains in the dewatered sample can be further released 
by pulverization and HNO 
3 –HF digestion [82] . Hwang et al. found 
that pulverization is ineffective for the release of water-insoluble 
Cl, while ∼32% of water-insoluble Cl, can be further extracted by 
3 –HF digestion [82] . Therefore, it was concluded that water- 
HNO 
insoluble chlorine originates is due to chemical rather physical as- 
sociation. 

mination of Cl, using the sintering method followed by ICP-SFMS 
measurements. It was found that due to the interfering molecular 
ions derived either from atmospheric gasses or from water, which 
cannot be eliminated readily; ICP-SFMS should be used with care, 
as the results may be altered. Additionally, ICP can be combined 
with a muﬄe furnace combustion method. The quantiﬁcation of 
TCC by muﬄe furnace combustion, and further analysis by ICP-OES, 
has a detection limit of 6 μg per gram of sample [52] . 

X-ray  ﬂuorescence  (XRF)  spectrometry  is  a  commonly  used 
method for the analysis of major and trace elements, which can 
be quantiﬁed at ppm-level. The main advantage of XRF is its ca- 
pability to directly analyze any waste samples prepared as pressed 
powder pellets or glass discs, as well as bulk powdered samples 
[86] . The TCC can be measured directly by XRF, without combus- 
tion or digestion, which eliminates the possibility of procedural er- 
rors, associated with sample preparation. However, before analysis, 
the sample material must be ground and mixed uniformly, in or- 
der to ensure accurate results. Typically, the size of the sample to 
be pressed to form a pellet should be 4 g. To improve the stability 
of the pellets, a binding agent can be added to the sample powder, 
and the pellets can be placed on an auto sampler. Comparisons of 
different analytical methods, the Cl species detected by particular 
methods and the type of waste material suitable for certain analy- 
ses, are shown in Table 6 . 

2.4. Summary 

2.3.3. Spectroscopy method 

Spectroscopy  methods  allow  non-destructive  analyses  of  the 
TCC,  in  any  solid  waste  [83] .  These  methods  include  X-ray  ﬂuo- 
rescence (XRF), inductively coupled plasma-sector ﬁeld mass spec- 
trometry (ICP-SFMS), and, instrumental neutron activation analy- 
sis  (INAA)  [52] .  The  minimum  detection  limit  of  INAA  is  in  the 
sub-ppm  range,  with  accuracy  in  the  region  of  5%  [84] .  Spec- 
troscopy methods, however, have the disadvantage of a very strict 
requirement, concerning the homogeneity of solid samples, which 
makes  the  sample  preparation  time-consuming  and  laborious. 
Non-destructive  methods  can  be  combined  with  other  analytical 
techniques. For example, Österlund et al. [85] conducted the deter- 

Chlorine  characterization  in  MSW  has  been  widely  studied, 
which  has  produced  some  consistent  knowledge.  Compostable 
waste and PVC have equal importance, as the main sources of in- 
organic and organic Cl, and they lead to different combustion be- 
haviors of Cl. For PVC, the ratios between organic/inorganic and, 
combustible/incombustible are similar, whereas for kitchen waste, 
the case is the opposite. These ﬁndings have resulted in the use of 
two  separation technologies  for  chlorine removal—gravitation for 
plastics, and, water extraction for inorganic chlorides. A potential 
problem  in  Cl-removal  is  assessing  the  economic  aspect.  Plastic 
pre-sorting from mixed waste is expensive, e.g., costing 250–270

dollars  per  tons  in  Europe,  with  14–60  dollars  per  ton  for  glass 
sorting, in Germany and Austria. 

Although various analytical methods have been developed, the 
discussion  remains  ongoing  to  identify  a  fast,  sensitive,  applica- 
ble and accurate method for the determination of the Cl-content 
in solid fuels. Despite requiring the sample to be dissolved in an 
aqueous solution before analysis, IC and ICP-SFMS offer fast sam- 
ple throughput, multi-elemental detection capability, and compa- 
rable limits of detection. The major advantage of XRF is that it can 
be used directly on any solid waste materials, even though non- 
conductive materials require coating before analysis. The water ex- 
traction method has been widely used in industry to remove un- 
desirable elements such as Na, K, and Cl. The standard method of 
oxygen bomb testing tends to be a time-consuming procedure, as 
only one sample can be prepared at a time. 

In  comparison  with  the  bomb  method,  the  oxygen  bomb 
method yield 15%–25% lower Cl concentration values, than those 
of  the  quartz  furnace  method  [81] .  Schirmer  et  al.  [54]  carried 
out a series of experiments to compare the oxygen bomb, oxygen 
ﬂask, XRF, furnace tube and water extract methods. They pointed 
out that 1) the oxygen bomb method shows 30% lower values for 
high-Cl content components ( > 0.5%); 2) results of the furnace tube 
method are generally 10–50% lower than those from the oxygen 
ﬂask combustion method; 3) colorimetry produces similar results, 
except for organic waste (kitchen waste); and 4) XRF produces ap- 
proximately 35–50% lower values than Schoeniger combustion for 
the paper and cardboard fraction and plastic fraction. Finally, the 
researchers  drew  a  conclusion  that  oxygen  ﬂask  combustion  ac- 
cording to Schoeniger, is the most stable method. In Ma and Rotter 
[80] and Watanabe et al. [55] , the residues on the quartz boat was

To permit the quantiﬁcation of TCC in wastes materials, differ- 
ent methods are proposed as the most attractive by different au- 
thors. They have not reached a general consensus on a widely used 
technique, and more emphasis is still needed in future work in this 
ﬁeld. The diﬃculty is not only in deﬁning a cost-effective proce- 
dure, but also in providing reliable and accurate results. 

3. Thermal behavior of chlorine during MSW combustion 

3.1. Chlorine volatilization and HCl formation 

3.1.1. Chlorine release 

Chlorine is one of the critical parameters in boiler operational 
problems,  particularly  causing  corrosion,  and  its  release  mecha- 
nism from MSW during incineration is of utmost importance. Be- 
cause  of  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  MSW,  the  release  behav- 
ior  of  chlorine  is  complex.  Pedersen  et  al.  [9]  studied  Cl-release 
from  dedicated  MSW-fractions  and  observed  that  the  Cl-release 
increased gradually with the temperature. As an example, at 500 
°C,  approximately  100%  and  60%  Cl  was  released  from  PVC  and 
shoes, respectively, while in other waste materials such as shredder 
wastes, no Cl-release was observed at the same temperature. At 
10 0 0 °C, 95% of Cl was released from shoes, and a 50% release was 
now observed from shredder waste [9] . Watanabe et al. [55] used 
synthetic waste to study Cl-release in the temperature range [500–
900  °C]. Nearly half of the Cl was volatilized at 500  °C, while the 
non-volatilized  Cl  remained  in  the  ash.  The  Cl-release  increased 
with increasing temperature until nearly complete release ( > 95%) 
at  900  °C.  Similar  results  were  observed  in  full-scale  measure- 
ments by Belevi and Moench [87] and by Ma et al. [15] , who sep- 
arated raw household waste into different com ponents, and con- 
ducted  a  series  of  experiments  to  quantify  Cl-release  from  each 
component. Different incinerators have different heating rates and 
oxygen concentrations, which will also affect the Cl-release from 
MSW. Slow heating rates (10  °C/min to 800  °C), which are found

in grate combustors, result in higher Cl-release, whereas high heat- 
ing  rates  (up  to  500  °C/s  to  800  °C,  with  a  30-minute  hold  in 
which the experiment was kept at 800  °C for 30 min) occurring in 
ﬂuidized bed combustors, lead to lower Cl-release [34] . Wey et al. 
[69] examined the inﬂuence of inorganic and organic Cl on the for- 
mation of HCl during the incineration of waste in a ﬂuidized bed 
incinerator. The authors observed that the amounts of HCl formed 
from PVC vs. from NaCl, varied as a function of combustion condi- 
tions, as well as with the use of different additives. PVC (organic 
Cl) was found to release a greater amount of HCl than NaCl (in- 
organic Cl) [64] . Fig. 5 shows the release of Cl as HCl, during the

incineration of PVC under different operating conditions in a ﬁxed- 
bed furnace. 

During the drying stage, the temperature is very low, and the 
oxygen and carbon concentrations on the grate are near their max- 
imum values. In this temperature range, no HCl is generated, be- 
cause PVC is not decomposed. In the second stage of combustion, 
i.e., the gasiﬁcation/pyrolysis zone, PVC starts to decompose, and 
the HCl-concentrations and temperature increase, while the oxy- 
gen concentration decreases. In the combustion and char burnout 
stage, the temperature and oxygen concentration steeply increase, 
while the HCl concentration decreases to a minimum [68] . How- 
ever,  the  reactions  that  lead  to  Cl-release  from  waste  fuels  and 
how the Cl-release is affected by other species, such as alkali met- 
als, during the incineration of waste or biomass materials, are not 
clearly described or understood, at present. 

Björkman and Strömberg [88] examined Cl-release during py- 
rolysis of various types of biomass wastes, and, rape straw, and ob- 
served that Cl is released in two steps, the ﬁrst being in the tem- 
perature range [30 0–40 0  °C] with additional Cl being released in 
the range [70 0–90 0  °C]. Although the major fraction of Cl in these 
fuels was found to be inorganic, i.e., water-soluble, it was argued 
that the initial step of the release of Cl was not due to the evapora- 
tion of KCl due to the rather low vapor pressure of KCl, at temper- 
atures ∼400  °C. The authors suggest, that at temperatures < 400 
°C, the reaction of steam with alkali chlorides, in the presence of 
SiO 
2 according to reaction (R5) , is responsible for the release of Cl 
in the form of HCl: 

2KCl(s) + H 2 O(g) + n SiO 2 (s) → K 2 O,(SiO 2 ) n (s) + 2HCl(g)  (R5) 

In contrast, when sand and KCl were mixed in simulated dry 
and wet ﬂue gas atmospheres, no Cl-release was observed, show- 
ing that Cl-release is not inﬂuenced by the presence of SiO 
2 [88] . 
Upon adding KCl to wood low in Cl, such that the Cl content in the 
fuel became high, approximately 30–50% of the Cl was released al- 
ready during pyrolysis in the range [40 0–60 0 °C]. From these ﬁnd- 
ings, the authors conclude that Cl could be released due to the in- 
teraction of KCl, with the organic fraction in the fuel [88] . Further 
investigation of this was conducted by Zintl et al. [89] , who studied 
Cl-release during pyrolysis of mixtures of various biopolymers and 
KCl in the temperature range [20 0–70 0  °C]. Based on their results, 
it was suggested that KCl participates in an ion-exchange reaction 
with chain-bonded carboxylic groups, at low temperatures, form- 
ing HCl and potassium carboxylate, according to reaction (R6) , and 
as the temperature increases, the produced potassium carboxylate, 
is degraded according to reaction (R7) : 

R-COOH(s) + KCl(s) → R-COOK(s) + HCl(g) 

R-COOK(s) → R + CO 2 (g) + K(g) 

(R6) 

(R7) 

In  contrast,  Jensen  et  al.  [90]  suggested  that  at  temperatures 
in the range [20 0–40 0  °C], the original fuel structure is destruc- 
ted during pyrolysis, and Cl is removed from its solid fuel binding 
sites into the liquid tar. From the tar, Cl is released as HCl(g) to 
the gas phase, or, undergoes other secondary reactions either with 
alkali metals such as Na and K, yielding solid NaCl(s) and KCl(s), 
or with basic functionalities on the fuel char surface. Nevertheless, 
this process seems incomplete. The Cl-release at low temperatures 
may be due to the reaction of KCl with the char oxygen-containing 
functional groups, whereby K becomes bound to the char matrix, 
while Cl is released. This leads to nearly half of the chlorine be- 
ing  volatilized  as  HCl  during  devolatilization  in  the  temperature 
range [20 0–40 0  °C], while the non-volatilized chlorine remains in 
the residue [34,55,87] . 

Interestingly  and  somewhat  confusingly,  Knudsen  et  al. 
[91]  found  that  fuels  with  lower  Cl-content  released  higher 

amounts of Cl at 500  °C, than those with higher Cl-content when 
studying combustion of various biomass wastes in a ﬁxed-bed. The 
authors [91] suggested that the mode of occurrence of Cl in the 
fuel, had a major inﬂuence on the Cl-release, particularly during 
devolatilization. However, since both organically and inorganically 
associated Cl are released as HCl(g), during devolatilization or char 
burnout, the exact link between chemical association in the fuel 
and Cl-release is diﬃcult to quantify. 

During char burnout, the organic structure of the fuel breaks 
down, conveying the silicates towards closer contact with the re- 
tained K and Ca, which is primarily hosted in the center matrix of 
the organic structure. Reaction with metal silicates, therefore, pro- 
motes Cl-release, as alkali metals prefer combining with silicates, 
rather than chlorides when the temperature is low, and when the 
mass transfer conditions are favourable. On its way upward from 
the bottom of the fuel bed, HCl may also be recaptured by metal 
species in the char, such as char-bound alkali metals and alkali car- 
bonates [19] . At higher temperatures > 700  °C, the evaporation of 
alkali chlorides generated by secondary reactions, results in com- 
plete Cl-release. Meanwhile, the secondary reactions of HCl with 
alkali metals, affect the total amount of chlorine transferred from 
the waste to the gas phase, an effect which still needs further in- 
vestigation, particularly in terms of the gaseous residence time of 
the recapturing of HCl by char-bound particles. 

3.1.2. Interrelationships between chlorine and other key elements 
(Alkali, Pb, Zn, and S) 
3.1.2.1. Alkali metal release.  Alkali metals occur as inorganic salts, 
such as KCl and NaCl, or organically associated in waste materi- 
als, such as in wood and leather waste fractions [92] . Apart from 
the  presence  of  chlorine,  the  mode  of  occurrence,  and  distribu- 
tion of alkalis in fuels, affect their transfer from the fuel-bed to 
the gas phase, during incineration [87] . Currently, there have been 
very few studies reporting release mechanism of alkali metals, dur- 
ing MSW-incineration. Nevertheless, a wealth of information about 
the  release  of  inorganic  elements  including  alkali  metals  during 
biomass combustion is available in the literature [91,93–95] . The 
results from these studies revealed that alkali metals may be re- 
leased during MSW-incineration via similar mechanisms [9] . Fig. 6 
illustrates  the  release  of  K  and  Cl  from  wood  waste  and  ﬁber 
boards. 

During  MSW-incineration,  small  quantities  of  K  are  released 
during the devolatilization stage, at temperatures < 500  °C, while 
large amounts of K are released during the char burnout stage, pri- 
marily as alkali chlorides [95] . At low temperatures, organically as- 
sociated K in the waste or biomass, is released as KOH(g), as a re- 
sult  of  the thermal degradation of  the organic structure.  Due to 
the  high  amounts  of  oxygen  functionalities  in  chars,  K  exists  as 
an ion-exchangeable metal on the basic functionalities, within the 
organic structure of the waste material [96] . This fraction of K is 
released at temperatures < 500  °C [97,98] . Additionally, the disso- 
ciation of mixed Ca-alkali carbonates or simply alkali carbonates, 
in the presence of moisture results in the release of KOH(g), dur- 
ing incineration, according to reaction (R8) , for which an increase 
in temperature leads to more vaporization of K: 

(Ca-)potassium carbonates + H 2 O = KOH(g) + CO 2 (g) + CaO(s) 
(R8) 

Jensen et al. [90] reported that a substantial quantity of K is 
also released during pyrolysis in the form of KCl. Chlorine in the 
waste fuel reacts with K, and enhances its release as KCl(g) dur- 
ing pyrolysis and combustion. This process mainly occurs in the 
temperature  range  [70 0–80 0  °C].  The  molar  ratio  of  K/Cl  is  of 
great importance in the release of K, as was conﬁrmed by Knudsen 
et al. [91] , who used various biomasses including wheat straw, rice

straw, and barley, in their study. They found that fuels with higher 
Cl-content, corresponding to a low K/Cl molar ratio, release larger 
percentages of K, than fuels with low Cl-content. For example, in 
wheat straw with a K/Cl ratio of 4, only 20% of the K was released 
from this fuel, while in barley and rice with a K/Cl ratio of 2, ap- 
proximately 40–50% of the K was released [91] . In fuels with low 
Cl-content, a greater portion of Cl is released as HCl(g), at temper- 
atures < 500  °C, leading to a small fraction of K released as KCl, at 
higher temperatures. At temperatures in the range [800–850  °C], 
the char-bound alkali metals, mostly originating from organically 
associated  alkali  metals  or  from  the  reaction  of  alkali  chlorides 
with the char during pyrolysis, decompose, releasing a substantial 
amount of K [93] . As the ﬂue gas temperature increases to around 
700  °C, the alkali chlorides volatilize, yielding a gas rich in chlo- 
rine species. At this temperature, various forms of chlorine and al- 
kali metal species, in particular K (e.g., KCl 
(g) ), 
become enriched in the ﬂue gas. Above 850  °C, the inorganic frac- 
tion of the fuel, such as alkali carbonates or sulfates, decomposes 
according to reactions (R8) and (R9) , respectively, releasing Na and 
K [9] :

However, the presence of mineral elements, e.g., Si, originating 
from rocks or soil that contaminate MSW, during the handling and 
transport, affects the release of Na and/or K during the combus- 
tion of the waste fuels, at temperatures above 800  °C. This phe- 
nomenon was observed by Ma et al. [15] during MSW-incineration, 
and, by Knudsen et al. [91] during biomass combustion. They ob- 
served that the K-release at temperatures > 900  °C was strongly 
inﬂuenced  by  the  amount  of  Si,  in  the  waste  materials.  Alkali 
chlorides and/or oxides become incorporated into silicate matrixes, 
yielding low-volatile species at high temperatures [15] . Therefore, 
a large amount of silicate compared to that of K, leading to a low 
K/Si,  restricts  the  release  of  K  to  the  gas  phase  [91] .  Based  on 
these results, van Lith and co-workers gave a detailed explanation. 
They pointed that the KCl initially present in the fuel, reacts with 
the organic char functional groups, during devolatilization, form- 
ing  HCl(g),  and,  char  matrix-bound  K.  During  char  burnout,  the 

4  (s), react with Al, Ti, and 
char matrix-bound K, as well as K 
Si in the residual ash, yielding alumina-silicates, aluminates, sili- 
cates, and titanates which are stable at temperatures up to 1150 
°C, and releasing SO 
2 (g). This lowers the amount of K released into 
the gas phase, at high temperatures [93,94] . 

2 SO 

It seems that Na has a different release behavior than that of 
K, as shown in Fig. 7 [93] . At temperatures < 850  °C, the release 
patterns  of  K  and  Na  follow  the  same  trend,  however,  at  tem- 
peratures  >  850  °C,  the  Na-release  increases  rapidly,  while  the 
K-release  remains  low  at  temperatures  up  to  1150  °C.  The  very 
low K-release during combustion of ﬁber board, in the temperature 
range of 500–1150  °C, releates strongly to the chemical composi- 
tion of ﬁber board. During the combustion of ﬁber boards, nearly 
all of the Cl is already released as HCl(g) at 500 °C, resulting in the 
low release of K through the evaporation of KCl(g), at higher tem- 
peratures. Additionally, the KCl originally present in ﬁber board, re- 
acts with functional groups in the organic char matrix during the 
devolatilization stage, forming HCl(g) and K, which become bound 
to the char matrix. The high release of Na at temperatures > 850 
°C is due to the difference between the behaviors of K and Na, dur-

ing combustion at low temperatures. The experimental results of 
van Lith et al. were supported by thermodynamic equilibrium cal- 
culations, which showed that K forms silicates, at low temperature 
of ∼500  °C, while Na preferably forms sulfates. When Na 
4 (s) 
starts to dissociate at higher temperatures > 800 °C, Na can be in- 
corporated into alumino-silicates; however, this process is limited 
if the sites in the fuel structure are already occupied by K. Thus, 
a larger fraction of Na is released into the gas phase as NaOH(g). 
This could be the reason why Na-release at > 850  °C was higher 
than that of K for ﬁber board.

3.1.2.2. Inﬂuence of chlorine on Zn- and Pb-release.  MSW contains 
large amounts of Pb and Zn due to waste materials rich in Pb- and 
Zn-species. Zinc and lead oxides are generally used e.g. as white 
pigments in paints. Zn also comes from stabilizers of metal soaps, 
such as Ba/Zn and Ca/Zn carboxylates that are organically associ- 
ated, while Pb is also present in the coatings of MSW-materials in 
the forms of PbO 
2 [9] . Under oxidizing con- 
3 , and Pb(OH) 
ditions,  Zn  prefers  to  form  solid  compounds  with  Si,  Al,  Ti,  and 
Fe at temperatures < 10 0 0  °C, above which Zn mainly appears in 
the gas phase as Zn(g). In the case of Pb, experimental ﬁndings 
[93] revealed that the volatilization of Pb begins around 500  °C, 
and that the concentration of Pb released, is inﬂuenced by the re- 
ducing/oxidizing conditions. Thermodynamic studies showed that 
reducing conditions promote the release of Pb, by generating ele- 
mentary substances, sulphides, and chlorides during waste inciner- 
ation, while under an oxidizing atmosphere PbO is stable at tem- 
peratures > 650  °C [99] . During pyrolysis, PbCO 
3 decomposes into 
PbO  [93] . PbO  is further  reduced to  volatile Pb(g) in a  reducing 
environment or may evaporate as PbO(g) [9,99,100] . In addition to 
the amount present in the waste, the release of trace metals also 
on the chemical mechanisms acting at high temperatures, which, 
in combination with the non-metallic elements, determine the re- 
lease to the gas phase [101] . The evaporation rate of trace metals 
during the MSW-incinertaion is enhanced by the presence of chlo- 
rine, which readily reacts with heavy metals, forming metal chlo- 
rides with low boiling points [102–105] . Increasing the concentra- 
tion of chlorine promotes the release of Zn and Pb from the bottom 
ash to the ﬂy ash and ﬂue gas, in the form of chlorides ( Fig. 8 ). 
For example, the release rates of Zn and Pb increased from 15% 
to 20% at 800  °C, when sludge was mixed with chlorides [103] . 
Chlorine  delays  the  condensation  of  metal  chlorides,  and  lowers 
their dew point temperature [68] , therefore making the migration 
of heavy metals from the bottom ash to the ﬂy ash or ﬂue gas easy

during MSW-incineration. However, chlorine in wastes is either or- 
ganically based, which is mainly from PVC, or inorganically based, 
which is mainly NaCl, CaCl 
2 . Different types of chlorine 
2 , and MgCl 
may have different impacts on the release of Zn and Pb. 

Wang et al. [99] examined the effect of organic (PVC) and inor- 
ganic (NaCl) chlorine on Pb-release. Both Cl-associations enhanced 
the volatilization of Pb ( Fig. 9 ), with PVC showing the strongest ef- 
fect. It was found that the addition of PVC to MSW, lowered the 
initial Pb-release temperature from 700  °C to nearby 500  °C, and 
increased the release rate of Pb at > 600  °C, while the addition of 
NaCl did not inﬂuence the initial release temperature of Pb, but 
promoted the release rate of Pb in the temperature range [700–
900  °C] [99] . Similar observations were found by [106] , who stud- 
ied the chlorination of PbO, ZnO, CuO, and CdO with PVC as well 
as NaCl. In contrast, some authors [107] have found that the ad- 
dition of inorganic chlorine (NaCl) enhances the release of Pb and 
Zn more strongly than the addition of organic chlorine (PVC). Their 
main point of concern regarding this ﬁnding was that during the 
combustion of PVC, chlorine becomes completely released before 
reacting with heavy metals. However, it was found by Wang et al. 
[106] that the chlorination effect of NaCl was signiﬁcantly weaker 
than that of PVC on heavy metals, during MSW-incineration. The 
authors suggested that Na has a greater aﬃnity for Cl, compared 
to heavy metals. The aﬃnity of some cations for Cl in decreasing

order is H > Na/K > Pb > Zn > other trace metals [102,108,109] , 
meaning  that  HCl  is  more  readily  formed  than  alkali-chlorides, 
which  again  is  more  readily  formed  than  Pb/Zn-chlorides.  Tang 
et al. [104] investigated the inﬂuence of various Cl-sources (NaCl, 
FeCl 
2 , and PVC) on the release of Zn, Pb, Cr, and Cu from 
tannery sludge, during incineration and observed that the promot- 
ing effect of Cl-addition increased with increasing temperature, in- 
creasing Cl/sludge ratios, and decreasing bond energy in Cl sources, 
leading to the increase of the release capacity of chlorine radicals. 
In other words, because of the low bond energy, PVC releases more 
Cl free radicals for the release of heavy metals at low tempera- 
tures  [99] , compared to  inorganic Cl-sources.  Conversely,  the  re- 
lease impact was lesser when NaCl was added, compared to when 
2 was added, because alkali metals have a stronger aﬃnity for 
CaCl 
chlorine, compared to earth-alkali metals. MgCl 
2  have 
greater releasing effects for most heavy metals than NaCl, which 
evaporates in substantial amounts without reacting and even de- 
creases the removal of Pb and Zn. NaCl directly chlorinates heavy 
metals [106] , while CaCl 
2  or HCl by 
reacting with O 

2  initially form Cl 
2 O (indirect chlorination) [110] .

Some studies [109,111,112] have doubted the direct reaction of 
inorganic chlorine (NaCl) with heavy metals. The idea is that, since 
Na has a higher aﬃnity for chlorine than heavy metals, direct chlo- 
rination is less likely to happen, and therefore, it has been sug- 
gested that NaCl can enhance the release of heavy metals, in the 
presence of SiO 
2 O, according to the following 
reactions:

in the presence of only NaCl and heavy metals, i.e., without other 
substances, therefore a direct reaction between the NaCl and PbO 
upon contact was proposed. In the case of ZnO, no chlorides were 
detected; thus, it was concluded that NaCl cannot directly interact 
with ZnO [99] .

Based on the ﬁndings from these studies, it is concluded that 
the amount and type of chlorine, as well as the presence of other 
inorganics such SiO 
3 , enhance the release of Pb 
and Zn. It is believed that gas phase reactions and gas-solid re- 
actions  between  Cl-species  and  heavy  metal  compounds,  are  vi- 
tal for the chlorination of trace metals. Therefore, further research 
is  needed  to  investigate  the  inﬂuence  of  the  gas  retention  time 
on  the  formation  of  metal  chlorides  that  vaporize  during  MSW- 
incineration.

3.1.2.3. Release of S and its correlation with Cl.  The release of S from 
MSW-incineration or biomass combustion on a grate also plays a 
major role for aerosol formation, deposition and corrosion prob- 
lems encountered in boilers. Studies on the release of S from mu- 
nicipal waste fractions [25,87] and biomass fuels [19,93,113] have 
revealed that S occurs in the gas phase, and is the primary cause of 
aerosol formation and deposit formation. However, the precise S- 
release pattern and mechanisms in relation to fuel feedstock com- 
position and S-associations (chemically and physically) in the fuel 
are not well understood. 

Dayton et al. [95] collected hot ﬂue gasses released during de- 
volatilization and combustion of various types of biomass directly 
in  a  molecular-beam  mass  spectrometer.  Sulfur  dioxide,  SO 
2 (g), 
was  identiﬁed  during  devolatilization,  and  it  was  suggested  that 
2 (g)-release. A 
the oxidation of organic S in biomass resulted in SO 
similar observation was made at a temperature of 500  °C, during 

incineration of different waste fractions [9] . Based on the fact that 
similar amounts of S, were produced during pyrolysis of different 
fuels at 500  °C, it was pointed out that the release of S starts dur- 
ing the devolatilization stage of combustion [114] . This was further 
supported by an experimental investigation conducted by Knudsen 
et al., who used various biomasses to investigate the release of or- 
ganic as well as inorganic S. The authors found that the quantity of 
inorganic sulfates in the fuel char remained almost the same, up to 
a temperature of 50 0–60 0  °C, while the total S-content in the fuel 
char decreased within the same temperature range, indicating that 
the S-release during devolatilization is mainly a result of the de- 
composition of organic S-compounds, instead of inorganic sulfates 
[91] . 

2 SO

4  and  CaSO 

The same authors [115] investigated the inﬂuence of secondary 
reactions of released S, with fuel char, during the combustion of 
wheat straw. They observed that considerable amounts of SO 
2 (g) 
are captured by the char, in the temperature range [400–950  °C]. 
2 (g) released from the decomposition of organic sulfur, at 
The SO 
the base of the fuel bed, becomes captured by the char in the top 
layer  of  the  fuel  bed,  due  to  the  reaction  of  S  with  some  func- 
tional groups of the organic char matrix, yielding char-bound S, or 
by reactions with inorganic species such as Ca and K in the char, 
forming sulfates during its upward diffusion into the ﬂue gas [114] . 
4  are  stable  at  temperatures > 10 0 0  °C  in  their 
K 
pure form, but the presence of silicate may reduce the maximum 
temperature at which K 
4 is stable in the ash, due to the prefer- 
ential reaction of K with silicate at temperatures > 800  °C. Due to 
the low solubility of sulfur oxides in Ca-K-silicates, small amounts 
of sulfur are captured by the silicate compounds, resulting in the 
signiﬁcant release of S to the gas phase, at high temperatures [91] . 
Aside from the role played by silicate, Cl, which occurs in high 
quantities  in  waste  fuels  [32] ,  reacts  with  K  to  form  KCl  [116] , 
which  lowers  the  concentration  of  K  available  for  reaction  with 
S. Thus, the S-release is enhanced by a relatively high Cl/K mo- 
lar ratio [9] . Ma et al. [15] further investigated the correlation be- 
tween Cl and S-release during MSW-incineration. They found that 
when alkali chlorides are formed, the salts react with S to give HCl 
at ﬂue gas temperatures > 700 °C. Since sulfates are stable up to 
a temperature of 10 0 0 °C, this reduces the release of sulfur. The 
sulfur/chlorine ratio was suggested to have a major impact on the 
sulfur release. 

3.1.3. De-HCl and control of HCl 

When utilizing a Cl-rich fuel feedstock in a WtE plant, some- 
times it is decided to add a sorbent (or additive) to capture some 
of the Cl, released to the gas phase during incineration. Ca-based 
additives  are  very  popular  in  this  context  as  in  general  have  a 
high aﬃnity toward Cl, via the formation of CaCl 
2 (s). At the same 
time, Ca-based additives may simultaneously capture S-species and 
thereby affect both Cl- and S-chemistry in the freeboard and the 
ﬂue gas channel. 

2 ,  CaO,  and  CaCO 

Zhu  et  al.  [17]  investigated  the  effectiveness  of  Ca-based  ad- 
ditives  (Ca(OH) 
3 )  in  the  removal  of  HCl,  dur- 
ing  incineration  of  PVC.  The  investigations  were  carried  out  un- 
der a nitrogen atmosphere, at a ﬂow rate of 60 ml/min in a TG, 
and the temperature was set to increase from 50  °C to 950  °C, 
with  a  heating  rate  of  30  °C/min.  For  each  measurement,  7 mg 
PVC  was  used,  and  the  Ca-based  additives  were  added  accord- 
ing to the Ca/Cl molar ratios  of 1:1–2.6:1. The conditions inside 
the  furnace  were  monitored,  and  the  experiments  were  started 
when  the  system  conditions  were  stable.  The  author  observed 
that  the  optimum  Ca/Cl  molar  ratio  was  1.5  for  Ca(OH) 
2 ,  be- 
tween  1.5  and  2.6  for  CaO,  and  > 2.6  for  CaCO 
3 .  Therefore,  the 
additives’  eﬃciency  in  the  removal  of  HCl  was  in  the  order  of 
3 . However, Wey et al. [69] also investi- 
Ca(OH) 
gated the formation of HCl from organic and inorganic chlorides

during the incineration of waste with different additives (Ca(OH)

60 0,  70 0,  and  80 0  °C.  In  each  experiment,  6.46 g  sawdust,  0.2 g 
paper, 4.8 g PVC, and 3.8 g NaCl were used as the feedstock mate- 
rials. The emission of HCl applying any of the additives was much 
lower than that with no additive. In the case of an organic chlo- 
ride  feedstock,  the  removal  eﬃciencies  of  HCl  and  Cl 
2 ,  followed 
2 > CaCO 
the sequence of CaO > Ca(OH) 
2 . In the case of 
an inorganic chloride feedstock, the additives did not have appar- 
ent effects on the removal of HCl and Cl 
2 . Wang et al. [22] studied 
the eﬃciency of Ca(OH) 
2  in the dechlorination of PVC and NaCl 
under various combustion conditions. The authors found that the 
reaction temperature plays a fundamental role in the capture of Cl 
from both NaCl and PVC. The rate of the dechlorination decreased 
sharply when the temperature increased from 650 to 800  °C. The 
rate of dechlorination of Ca(OH) 
2  in the ﬂue gas was lower than 
that in the pyrolyzer, and was higher for PVC than for NaCl, un- 
der the same operating conditions. Thermogravimetric studies re- 
2 is not stable at high temperatures, leading to the 
vealed that CaCl 
decrease of the dechlorination capacity of Ca(OH) 
2 , as the temper- 
ature increased. 

Liu et al. [34] conducted experiments in an electrical furnace, 
using four RDF fuels with varying heating rates and oxygen con- 
centrations, and evaluated the HCl-removal capability of Ca(OH) 
2 , 
by measuring the HCl-emissions in the ﬂue gas and the fraction 
of  Cl  captured  in  the  ash  residue.  The  compositions  of  the  RDF 
samples are shown in Table 7 . When the Ca/(S + 0.5Cl) molar ratio 
was varied between 0.4 and 12.6, the fraction of Cl captured in the 
ash residue increased. When the RDF-samples were subjected to 
fast heating rate experiments, with a molar ratio of more than 4.9 
Ca(OH) 
2 , more than 45% of the Cl was captured in the ash residues. 
When the molar ratio was increased to 12.6, the fraction of Cl cap- 
tured increased to 67.8%. When the experiments were conducted 
under slow heating rates (10  °C/min to 800  °C), with a molar ra- 
tio below 2.4, almost no Cl was captured by the ash residue. Nev- 
ertheless, when the molar ratio was increased to 12.6, the fraction

was detected in the ash, in the absence of an additive, but when 
the molar ratio of Ca/Cl was increased from 0 to 13, the captured 
fraction of Cl-components in the ash increased from 0 to ∼70%.

The capture of Cl could be due to the reaction of Ca(OH) 
with HCl to form CaCl

3.2. Formation of ﬂy ash and aerosol particles 

Once chlorine and other inorganic elements are released to the 
gas phase from a fuel, they undergo a number of complex phys- 
ical and chemical reactions, forming intermediate ash species in- 
cluding  gasses,  liquids,  and  solids  [100] .  The  size  distribution  of 
the ash particles formed and their chemical and physical composi- 
tions, affect their subsequent behavior in the waste boilers [100] . 
Generally, the residual ash formed during incineration can be di- 
vided into coarse ﬂy ash and aerosols with particle sizes < 1 μm. 
Fig. 10 illustrates the formation of ash particles during the com- 
bustion of waste fuel. 

In case one of the species formed above the fuel-bed (i.e. in the 
freeboard of the incinerator), during subsequent cooling of the ﬂue 
gas becomes supersaturated, a gas-to-particle conversion may take 
place.

2  to  KCl,  O 

In  contrast  to  the  above  mechanism  for  the  formation  of 
aerosols,  some  authors  [122–124]  disagreed  that  the  low  vapor 
pressure  of  gaseous  sulfate  in  a  boiler  can  lead  to  an  adequate 
amount  of  gaseous  sulfate  present  to  allow  the  nucleation  pro- 
cess to take place. Their main point-of-concern, regarding the ho- 
mogeneous formation of sulfate, is that this reaction is kinetically 
very demanding. Alternatively, they put forward that in a real com- 
bustion atmosphere seed particles with different chemical compo- 
sitions,  already  occur  in  the  gas  and  act  as  condensation  nuclei 
for  the  formation  of  aerosols,  when  sulfate  is  formed  at  higher 
temperatures. Nevertheless, other researchers [125] argue that the 
concentrations of particles formed after the condensation of sul- 
fate, were orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations of 
particles observed in the hot ﬂue gas. In this view, Jensen et al. 
[90]  added  SO 
2 O,  during  an  experiment  in 
which synthetic ﬂue gas was heated to a maximum temperature 
between 770  °C and 10 0 0  °C, and subsequently cooled in the sat- 
urator and condenser at temperatures between 693–751  °C. The 
authors observed that it was impossible to suppress the formation 
of new particles by homogeneous nucleation, as the observed con- 
centration of particles increased from 6.7 × 10 6  cm −3  in the case 
2 in the feed, but 
without SO 
when pure  chlorides  of  Na  and  K  were  tested  for  homogeneous 
nucleation in the presence of K 
4 as the seed par- 
2 SO 
ticles for KCl and NaCl, respectively, under the same temperature 
conditions, the nucleation of NaCl and KCl vapors was effectively 
suppressed by the sulfate particles, which served as the condensa- 
tion nuclei for the succeeding condensation of sulfate and chloride 
vapours in the boiler. In addition, Jimenez and Ballester [125] re- 
ported that particles sampled from ﬂue gasses at high tempera- 
tures were composed of almost pure K 
4 , with no traces of con- 
densed KCl.

The mechanism of the formation of aerosols, was extended to 
municipal  waste  incinerators  by  Deuerling  et  al.  [126] ,  who  iso- 
kinetically collected raw gas samples in a waste incineration plant, 
and quenched it in a porous tube diluter (PTD). They found three 
main particle sizes in the distribution of ash particles. The coarse 
fraction ( > 20 μm) contained large amounts of primary ash particles 
from the grate, rich in Si and Ca. Fine ash particles were rich in Cl, 
alkali, and S, but also contained a signiﬁcant amount of heavy met- 
als (Pb, Zn). Middle-sized ash particles chemically intersected the 
coarse and ﬁne particles, as shown in Table 8 . Interestingly, the au- 
thor suggested that oxides of heavy metals released from the grate 
during combustion, also act as condensation nuclei for secondary 
particles [126] . This observation was further investigated, and re- 
ﬁned by Brunner et al. [127] , who used a high-temperature cascade 
impactor to sample size-fractioned particles from an MSW-boiler

Fig. 11 illustrates the equilibrium distribution of the gas species, 
during the combustion of straw [118] . At high temperatures, K oc- 
curs  mainly  as  KCl,  while  extra  chlorine  and  sulfur  are  present 
2 ,  respectively.  As  the  temperature  decreases,  the 
as  HCl  and  SO 
4 increases, since KC1 
2 SO 
amount of KCl decreases, while that of K 
4  through  a  number  of  gas-phase  reactions 
is  converted  to  K 
2 SO 
[20,119] . Because the equilibrium vapor pressure of K 
4 is much 
lower  than  that  of  KCl,  the  sulfation  reaction  together  with  the 
cooling itself, causes the saturation ratio of K 
4 to increase [118] . 
As the ﬂue gas cools further down, gas molecules starts to form 
clusters of 3 gas molecules or more. If the cooling occurs quickly, 
there  is  not  enough  time  for  the  gasses  to  condense  heteroge- 
neously, so the gas molecule clusters grow even larger in size. At 
some point (the critical super saturation point), the clusters pass 
a  certain  critical  level,  at  which  the  homogeneous  nucleation  of 
4 takes place between 820  °C and 750  °C, leading to the for- 
K 
mation of very ﬁne new K 
4 -particles in large amounts. The new 
particles are formed in large numbers, which causes a substantial 
coagulation to occur, forming eventually an aerosol. Additionally, 
the particles formed have a very large speciﬁc surface area, which 
promote the rapid heterogeneous condensation of any remaining 
K 
2  [120] ; thus, depleting the ﬂue gas 
from those species. As the temperature decreases to 500  °C, al- 
most all gaseous potassium is condensed and present in the solid 
ash particles [118,121] .

undergo homogenous chemical reaction and form vapors 
with low saturation vapor pressure, leading to gas-to-particle

condensation, contributing to the total aerosols.

at different locations. It was found that during combustion, eas- 
ily volatilized and semi-volatile elements such as Cl, Na, K, Pb, Zn, 
and S, were released from the fuel bed to the gas phase. At the 
same time, mineral inclusions such as Ca- and Mg-rich minerals 
in  the  waste  fuel  were  fragmented  by  thermal  stresses,  forming 
coarse  ash  particles,  which  become  entrained  from  the  fuel  bed 
[127] . Due to the reducing conditions and high temperatures that 
occur in char particles during char burnout, reductions of refrac- 
tory oxides to suboxides such as Al 
2 O, SiO, or to elemental forms 
occur, and the products are released into the gas phase [128,129] . 
After diffusion of refractory sub-oxides or elements to the char 
surface, they enter zones with higher oxygen partial pressures, and 
reform oxides, which, due to their low saturation vapor pressure, 
nucleate to form ﬁne particles (see Fig. 12 ). Additionally, because 
of the reducing conditions prevailing in char burnout, Zn is also re- 
leased to the gas phase as elemental Zn, but as soon as it reaches 
zones with oxidizing conditions, e.g. nearby the secondary air in- 
let, it is oxidized to ZnO, which then nucleates. Further research 
is needed to elaborate on whether volatile heavy metals, such as 
ZnO, and oxides of refractory components, such as SiO 
2 , supersat- 
urate and nucleate before alkali sulfates and to examine whether 
the further nucleation of alkali compounds and heavy metal salts 
can be suppressed by condensation onto ZnO nuclei. 

3.3. Transport mechanism of ash species 

The particles that are formed in the boiler are solid particles, 
vapor species, aerosols or ﬁne particles, and they are transported 
to the heat transfer surfaces by different mechanisms. Alkali met- 
als in solid particles occur largely as alumina-silicates or silicates, 
4 (s), and MCl(s), and vapor species occur primarily as M(g), 
M 
4 (g) (M = Na or K) [131] . Fig. 13

and K

Vapor phase species or submicron particles are transported by 
diffusion or by thermophoretic forces [100] . Studies by Cameron 
and Georg-Wood [133] and Walker et al. [134] indicate that ther- 
mophoresis is dominant for particles with diameters in the range 
of 0.1 < d p > 10 μm. Particles entrained in a gas ﬂow in space de- 

velop thermophoretic forces due to a temperature gradient in the 
local gas in which the particle is suspended or as a consequence 
of a temperature gradient in the particle itself, leading to move- 
ment  towards  lower-temperature  areas  by  a  process  called  ther- 
mophoresis [135] . Due to the strong temperature gradient that oc- 
curs in the ﬂue gas, a particle entrained in the gas interacts with 
molecules that have higher kinetic energies on the side with the 
hot ﬂuid than on the side with the cold ﬂuid. The energetic col- 
lisions of the high-energy molecules on the hot side of the parti- 
cle create a stronger force than those of the low-energy molecules 
on  the  cold  side.  This  gives  rise  to  a  net  force  on  the  particle 
called the thermophoretic force. The thermophoretic ﬂux of sub- 
micron particulates towards surfaces can be calculated based on 
the thermophoretic velocity, and the thermophoretic force can be 
expressed as a function of Knudsen numbers (K n ) [136,137] . If the 
Knudsen  number  (K n )  <  1,  the  ﬂow  characteristics  can  be  de- 
scribed  by  continuum  mechanics,  while  if  the  K n  >  1,  they  can 
be described by methods of statistical mechanics, see the work by 
Kleinhans  et  al.  [135]  for  detailed  mathematical  modeling.  Ther- 
mophoretic deposits have ﬁner grains and are evenly distributed 
around the tube surface. As the amount of deposits increases on 
the tube surface, the temperature gradient decreases in the ther- 
mal boundary layer, thereby decreasing the rate at which the ther- 
mophoresis process occurs [137,138] . 

Vapor particles containing condensing materials, such as alkali 
chlorides, are transported by diffusion, facilitated by the conden- 
sation mechanism which removes the condensing gaseous species 
that are close to the tube wall or above the deposit when the gas 
temperature falls below the vapor dew point. A ﬂuid becomes sat- 
urated when the vapor pressure of the condensing species equals 
the saturation pressure of the same species [139] . Vapours traverse 
through  the  boundary  layer  and  condense  heterogeneously  on  a 
heat-transfer surface, on the surface of an already formed deposit 
or within a porous deposit, or vapors homogeneously nucleate to 
form  fumes,  which are  then  transported  by  either  small-particle 
diffusion driven by Fick’s ﬁrst law of diffusion or by thermophore- 
sis [100,140] . In situations in which condensation occurs on clean 
tubes, a thin, sticky ﬁlm is formed which may change the pick-up 
processes of other solids. Fig. 10 shows that alkali sulfates begin

to condensate at high temperatures of around 1200  °C. Therefore, 
they most likely appear on ﬂy ash particles in the superheater re- 
gion or within the boundary layers of heat exchangers. In contrast, 
alkali chlorides supersaturate at lower temperatures and, thus, pos- 
sibly condense directly on the boiler tubes. A vital property is the 
dew point of a metal vapor. Below this point, condensation effects 
of, for example, inorganic vapors in the boundary layer of a super- 
heater tube result in sub-micron particles, facilitating the build-up 
of deposits. If an inorganic vapor is above its dew point, chemical 
reactions take place either with other gasses or with solids, such 
as ash particles or deposits. These reactions can then change the 
melting temperature or lead to a sticky surface, again promoting 
the ash deposition rate [135] . 

Large  ash  particles,  usually  with  particle  diameters > 10 μm, 
which have high inertial momentum to follow the gas streamlines 
are transported by the inertial forces to the heat transfer surface 
[137] .  Particles  respond  to  the  gas  ﬂow  ﬁeld  in  the  combustion 
section and begin to move around. When the inertia of the par- 
ticles overcomes the aerodynamic drag forces, the particles impact 
the heat transfer surfaces [137] . This phenomenon is generally ex- 
pressed by the Stokes number, which is a ratio of the particle re- 
laxation  time  to  a  characteristic  ﬂow  time  scale.  The  ﬂow  time 
scale is the time that the free-stream ﬂow needs to pass the su- 
perheater tube radius [135] . The schematic illustration of the im- 
paction process of particles on the boiler tube is shown in Fig. 14 . 
In the diagram, the incident black particles that are approaching 
the superheater tube cannot follow the curvature of the stream- 
lines of the gas ﬂow due to their huge mass, which keeps them 
in the current direction of the trajectory. Thus, the inertial forces 
exceed the aerodynamic forces. The rate of impaction is then de- 
ﬁned as the ratio of the number of particles impacting the heat 
transfer surface to the overall number of particles ﬂowing towards 
the surface in the free gas ﬂow. Large particles are also reported in 

the literature on the leeward side of the tube. These particles are 
impacted by the recirculation process, which is inﬂuenced by the 
free-stream ﬂow velocity [135,141,142] . 

3.4. Formation and growth of ash deposits 

Once the ash particles arrive at the metal surface of the boiler 
tube, deposits start to form. The questions are how do the ash de- 
posits start to build up and what are the mechanisms responsible 
for ash particle collection on the metal surface to form an accumu- 
lated deposit mass? Are all the particles that reach the surface of 
the boiler captured equally? 

Frandsen [143] suggested that ash deposit growth started with 
the impaction of large Fe-rich particles onto the sticky sulfate layer. 
Baxter [137] explained how the formation of ash deposits is ini- 
tiated.  The author pointed out  that for deposit formation to oc- 
cur, chemical reactions are important, through which the incident 
gasses heterogeneously react with the tube surface, leading to the 
accumulated  mass  of  the  deposit.  Chemical  reactions  may  cause 
the vapor pressure of a certain species to be zero around the de- 
posit surface, thereby maintaining a gradient of concentration with 
the bulk gas thus strongly inﬂuenced by diffusion processes and 
reactions. Among the most important chemical reactions are alkali 
absorption, sulfation, oxidation and reduction, carbonation and the 
formation of low-temperature eutectics from the interactions of K, 
Na, Fe, Ca, Si, and Al. The principal sulphating species of concern 
are compounds containing alkali metals, mainly, sodium and potas- 
sium chlorides and hydroxides. This phenomenon was pursued by 
Hansen et al. [144] , who studied the deposit formation on a grate 
ﬁring straw. A K 
4 layer was found only in the mature deposits 
which were exposed to the boiler environment over a period of 
one year, while the probes which had been exposed for short pe- 
2 SO 
riods of time in the straw boiler contained only KCl, and no K

was detected in the inner layers. From these ﬁndings, the authors 
suggested that KCl is the species that is deposited ﬁrst, and it later 
reacts with sulfur-containing species, such as gaseous SO 
3 , 
4 . However, it was observed that the potential sulfa- 
to form K 
tion reaction occurs relatively slowly. For example, a probe exposed 
for 6 h in the straw boiler did not show any sign of sulfation. In- 
stead, KCl layers of 10 0–20 0 mm thickness were observed. Based 
on these results, it was pointed out that KCl forms eutectic mix- 
4 at 690  °C, and with Fe x O y .

In  contrast,  some  authors  [145,146]  give  reasons  to  doubt 
this  initial  deposit  formation  mechanism.  They  believe  that  the 
condensation of alkali sulfates from the gas phase onto the cooler 
regions  of  the  furnace  walls  or  superheater  are  responsible  for 
the  initiation  of  deposit  formation  and  alkali  chlorides  are  then 
deposited on top of the sulfate layer. The idea is that condensed 
alkali sulfates (e.g., K 
4 ) are more stable at higher temperatures 
than  condensed  KCl.  This  mechanism  was  also  reported  and 
reﬁned by Mu et al. [147] and Ma et al. [32] , who observed the 
alternating  layered  structures  of  deposits  in  waste  incinerators. 
The ash deposit formation and growth on a superheater tube is 
shown in Fig. 15 . In the gas phase, chlorine forms aerosols of KCl 
and NaCl, and alkalis also form K 
4 . These species 
undergo  complex  chemical  reactions  and  transformations  due  to 
the  presence  of  other  species  such  as  Si  and  Al.  NaCl  and  KCl 
become  sulphated,  siliciﬁed  or  alumina-siliciﬁed.  This  decreases 
the concentrations of NaCl and KCl in the ﬂue gas. Because sul- 
fates have equilibrium vapor pressures much lower than those of 
chlorides  with  decreasing  temperature,  sulfates  condense  on  the 
heating  surface,  forming  an  initial  deposit  layer,  which  is  sticky. 
Alkali  chlorides  heterogeneously  condense  on  the  surface  of  ﬂy 
ash, leading to the formation of a stickier layer, or further react 
with SiO 
2 to form silicates with low melting temperatures, thereby 
increasing the sticking propensity of the initial deposit layer. This 
process  enriches  the  initially  deposited  layer  with  ﬁne  ﬂy  ash 
particles  that  are  rich  in  Na,  K,  Cl,  and  S.  Coarse  ash  particles 
containing higher amounts of Al, Si, and other mineral elements, 
either with a sticky layer due to the heterogeneous condensation 
of alkali aerosol on them, or without a sticky layer, subsequently 
bind  to  the  surface  of  the  initial  sticky  deposit  layer  by  inertial 
impaction  [143] .  The  critical  velocity  of  a  moving  ash  particle, 
which  is  negatively  correlated  to  the  particle  diameter,  and  the 
properties of the particle and the surface determine whether the 
incident particles may stick or rebound from the tube wall surface 
[135] . If the incident particle has a kinetic energy amount which 

is smaller than its critical velocity, the particle stick to the surface, 
while in other cases, the particle rebound. Submicron particles ar- 
rive at the boiler tube wall surface with the kinetic energy within 
their adhesion energy, and all of them stick to the surfaces of the 
boiler tube due to van der Waals and electrical forces, while coarse 
ash particles arrive at the tube wall surface with kinetic energy 
different  from  their  binding  energy,  and,  hence,  some  particles 
rebound [135,148] . Additionally, if there is a liquid phase present 
on the surface wall or if the incident particle has a molten phase 
around  it,  it  is  more  likely  to  stick  to  the  surface  of  the  boiler 
tube  walls  [139] .  Thermodynamic  equilibrium  calculations  for  a 
multi-phase  multi-component  system  [149]  showed  the  criteria 
for the melt fraction which enable particles to stick. If the particle 
has a liquid fraction of 15%, it is able to stick to the surface, and 
the temperature at which this percentage occurs is known as the 
sticky temperature. When the ash particles or the outer surface of 
a  deposit  contain  a  more-than-70%  liquid  fraction,  new  material 
will  ﬂow  down  from  the  surface  [150] ;  thus,  a  steady  state  of 
deposit  formation  is  reached,  whereby  there  is  an  equilibrium 
between incoming particles and deposit ﬂowing off [151] . The cri- 
terion for the melt fraction is not universal, and different numbers 
can be used. In this view, Zhou et al. studied the deposit build-up 
using mathematical modeling and found the sticking probabilities 
for particles between 10% < fp < 70%, in which the sticking proba- 
bility increased linearly between the threshold [152] . Additionally, 
the rapid cooling upon the impaction of particles on the surface 
affects the particle sticking. The difference between the tempera- 
ture of the ﬂue gas and that of the clean heat exchanger can be as 
high as 223 °C, and results in the rapid cooling of the ash particles 
within  the  boundary  layer  or  during  impaction  [135] . When  the 
ﬁne  ash  particles  that  are  initially  deposited  are  unable  to  bind 
coarse ash particles, they undergo re-enrichment, and eventually, 
distinct  layers  are  formed  during  the  growth  of  the  deposits 
[32,51] . Meanwhile, more research is needed to incorporate heavy 
metal  compounds  into  the  deposition  mechanism,  but  related 
information is scarce in the literature, as it is possible for heavy 
metals such as ZnCl 
2  to form a sticky layer or molten layer that 
may further enhance the sticking mechanism of the ash particles. 

3.5. Inﬂuence of the temperature on deposition of Cl 

The temperatures of both ﬂue gas and metal surface have pro- 
nounced inﬂuence on the deposit formation and the chemical com- 
positions  of  deposits,  including  the  level  of  Cl  present.  Thermo- 
dynamic  equilibrium  calculations  for  waste  incineration  by  Ot- 
suka  [154] ,  showed  that  the  inﬂuence  of  the  ﬂue  gas  tempera- 
ture, is greater than the inﬂuence of the metal tube temperature 
in  relation  to  formation  of  corrosive  deposits  on  the  surfaces  of

superheater tubes. As the ﬂue gas temperature increased to > 550 
°C,  the  molar  amounts  of  condensed  NaCl  and  KCl  increased, 
whereas  when  the  tube  temperature  was  increased,  the  con- 
densed fraction of alkali chlorides remained unchanged [154] . 

ing particles. The high temperature of the ash deposit layer also 
makes it easily sintered, thereby increasing the sticking probability 
of ash particles; thus, the deposition rate increases with increases 
in the metal temperature [155,156] . 

In  contrast,  Frandsen  et  al.  [28]  reported  that  an  increase  in 
the  metal  temperature,  from  400  to  450  °C,  caused  an  increase 
in the deposition ﬂux by a factor of 2. The Cl-concentration was 
doubled in the deposit formed at 450  °C, compared to the deposit 
formed at 400 °C, whereas the alkali (K and Na) concentrations de- 
creased slightly, when increasing the temperature, mainly because 
of dilution in the deposit. This was conﬁrmed by Lai et al. [155] , 
who conducted an investigation to study the inﬂuence of the metal 
tube temperature on the deposition rate during MSW-incineration. 
An increased tube-wall temperature increased the amount of the 
molten  phase  in  the  deposits,  which  led  to  increased  stickiness. 
Tang et al. [156] also elaborated the inﬂuence of the surface tem- 
perature on ash deposition during MSW-incineration. They found 
that  as  the  surface  temperature  increased  from  560  °C  to  700 
°C,  the  rate  of  deposit  formation  increased  from  ∼0.08 g/hr  to 
∼0.12 g/hr. X-ray diffractometry analysis revealed that the ash de- 
posits  at  560  °C  were  mainly  composed  of  mineral  phases  of 
quartz (SiO 
3 , while at 700  °C, the contents 
2 O 
of  Cl,  K,  Na,  Al,  and  Si  in  the  ash  deposits  increased.  The  au- 
thors proposed that the critical velocity of the incident particle im- 
pacting the metal wall, causes the particle to deposit or rebound. 
Smaller particles have higher critical velocities than do larger par- 
ticles, suggesting that smaller particles easily adhere to the tube 
surface  [148] .  Considering  a  pre-deposited  probe,  with  a  surface 
temperature below 700  °C, which is lower than the melting tem- 
perature of the ash particles, the adhesion energy between the ash 
particles and the metal tube surface, is also low. This causes a high 
contribution from sub-micron particles to the deposit formation by 
thermophoretic/condensation mechanisms, during the initial depo- 
sition  stage.  With  the  increase  of  the  deposit  mass,  the  surface 
temperature of the ash deposit increases, due to the decrease of 
the ash heat-transfer coeﬃcient, causing partial melting of the ash 
deposits in the top layer [156] . For example, K 
4 has a melting 
point of 1069  °C, but it decreases to 694  °C when mixed with KCl 
4 [32] . A partly molten deposit 
2 SO 
to form the eutectic binary KCl-K 
becomes more adhesive, hence accelerating the capture of impact-

3.6.1. Gaseous chlorine corrosion 

HCl occurs in bulk gas containing moisture, while Cl 

2 occurs in 
a dry environment, or may result from the decomposition of HCl 
[157] . The gaseous Cl-corrosion mechanism is understood as an ac- 
tive oxidation phenomenon. In an oxidizing environment, the main 
reactions involved in active oxidation, can be summarized in reac- 
tions (R13)–(R17) [157,158] : 

2HCl(g) + 1/2O 2 (g) = Cl 2 (g) + H 2 O(g) 

M(s) + Cl 2 (g) = MCl 2 (s) 

MCl 2 (s) = MCl 2 (g) 

2MCl 2 (g) + 3/2O 2 (g) = M 2 O 3 (s) + 2Cl 2 (g)

where M = Fe, Cr or Ni. 

Under  oxidizing  conditions  and  at  temperatures  <  600  °C, 
HCl(g)  is  oxidized  at  the  deposit/gas  interface,  releasing  Cl 
2  gas, 
whereas  > 600  °C,  and  in  the  presence  of  water  vapor,  the  for- 
mation  of  HCl  is  enhanced  [158] .  The  chlorine  released  diffuses 
through cracks and pores to the scale/metal interface, where the 
oxygen partial pressure is low, and reacts with alloying elements 
like Fe and Cr to form solid metal chlorides. The temperature, HCl- 
content of the gas, and type of oxide formed on the metal/scale 
interface, all affect the vapor pressures of metal chlorides. As an 
example,  Table  9  displays  some  vapor  pressures  of  metal  chlo- 
rides  at  450  °C,  in  equilibrium  with  mixed  oxides.  Because  of 
their  volatility,  metal  chlorides  continuously  evaporate  from  the 
scale/metal interface to the oxide/gas interface, where high oxygen 
partial pressures prevail, and become re-oxidized, forming a very

idation is shown in Fig. 16 . Through (R16) and (R17) , the chlorine 
released diffuses back to the metal surface; therefore, with little 
or no net depletion of chlorine, a cycle occurs which provides the 
continuous  removal of  metals away from  the  metal surface,  and 
transport  towards  regions  with  higher  oxygen  partial  pressures, 
where oxides are formed. The net process is the oxidation of metal 
according to reaction (R18) [159] : 

2M(s) + 3/2O 2 (g) = M 2 O 3 (s) 

(R18) 

2 , followed by FeCl 
2 −232.1 kJ/mol; NiCl 

The validity of this active oxidation mechanism was supported 
by an experimental investigation by Zahs et al. [162] . The author 
investigated the corrosion behaviors of pure Fe, Cr, and Ni, the fer- 
ritic  alloys  Fe-15Cr  and  Fe-35Cr,  and  a  number  of  austenitic  al- 
loys in O 
2  and HCl, at temperatures in the range [40 0–70 0  °C]. 
A  comparison  of  the  Gibbs  free  energies  of  formation  for  the 
different divalent chlorides show the highest negative values for 
2  −286.0 kJ/mol; 
CrCl 
2 −174.2 kJ/mol). According to these data, 
FeCl 
a less-reactive behavior is expected for Ni than for Fe and Cr. The 
solid chlorides formed have considerable equilibrium vapor pres- 
sures (M x Cl y ) and, therefore, evaporate continuously, diffusing to- 
wards  the  gas/oxide  scale  interface.  Chlorides  of  Cr,  Fe,  and  Ni 
are oxidized at different partial pressures of oxygen; Cr-chlorides 
(CrCl 
2 , 
2 -partial  pres- 
while  Fe-chlorides  require  a  signiﬁcantly  higher  O 
2 -partial pres- 
2 ) requires the highest O 
sure, and Ni-chloride (NiCl 

3 )  are  oxidized  at  very  low  partial  pressures  of  O 

2  (600  °C: CrCl 

2  and NiCl

sure to transform into NiO, particularly at low temperatures. This 
implies  that  Cr-chlorides  evaporating  from  the  metal/scale  inter- 
face  are  oxidized  closer  to  the  metal  surface  than  Fe-chlorides 
[162] . 

Though there are some arguments regarding the rate at which 
the corrosion of metals occurs and whether it is determined by the 
outward diffusion of volatile metal chlorides through the porous 
2 , the general belief is that 
scale or by the inward diffusion of Cl 
active oxidation starts with a little incubation time, after the in- 
troduction of Cl [159] . At high temperatures and under oxidizing 
environments, metals are oxidized by the initial absorption of oxy- 
gen, and chemical reactions to form the surface oxide. The oxide 
then  undergoes  nucleation  and  lateral  growth  into  a  continuous 
ﬁlm that protects the underlying metal. In addition to oxygen, a 
metal can also be similarly oxidized at high temperatures by ei- 
ther  water  vapor  or  carbon  dioxide,  forming  a  protective  oxide 
layer which prevents the entry of gaseous species into the metal 
substrate [163,164] . However, many questions are raised regarding 
this mechanism. It has not been made fully clear how the corro- 
sion starts, if the oxide protects the metal underneath, and how 
the Cl penetrates the scale. Some authors [159,163] consider that 
chlorine itself create fast diffusion paths, possibly through grooves 
and ﬁssures, at grain boundaries. The main idea is that the solid- 
state diffusion, grain-boundary diffusion, and even molecular dif- 
fusion of Cl through cracks and pores of the scale cannot supply 
the Cl-amount necessary to explain the abrupt increase of the oxi- 
dation rate. While the active oxidation mechanism has credibly re- 
ceived experimental support [43,44,159,160,162] , an apparent prob- 
lem with the mechanism is that why the metal/scale interface has 
a low oxygen partial pressure but high chlorine partial pressure. 
Does  this  imply  that  oxygen  is  prevented  from  diffusing  across 
the scale, while chlorine, which has a larger molecular size, is al- 
lowed? Li et al. [161] suggested that the reaction of oxygen in the 
oxidation of alloy elements, particularly oxygen reactive elements 
such as Cr, at the metal/scale interface decreases the oxygen partial 
2 continues to diffuse into the interface, leading 
pressure, while Cl 
2 partial pressure at the metal/scale interface, in 
to an increased Cl 
turn allowing it to react with tube metals. 

3.6.2. Alkali compound deposit corrosion 

Chlorine in deposits is commonly present as chlorides of alkali 
metals. Therefore, fuels with high contents of alkalis and chlorine 
may  negatively  affect  the  performance  of  the  plant  [159] .  Alkali 
chlorides in deposits may decrease the melting range of deposits 
on  superheater  tubes,  down  to  temperatures  close  to  the  tube 
metal  temperatures  [51,165] .  The  direct  contact  of  a  molten  salt 
mixture  containing  chlorides  with  the  tube  metal  may  result  in 
catastrophic  corrosion  rates.  Alkali  chlorides  are  also  known  to 
be highly corrosive to steels, even under conditions at which no 
melting  takes  place.  Noguchi  et  al.  [164]  conducted  a  full-scale 
experimental  investigation  of  deposit-induced  high-temperature 
corrosion in an MSW-incinerator. The boiler tubes were made of 
SUS310, and operated at a steam temperature of 400  °C. After two 
years of operation, the metal had lost 0.45 mm of thickness. The 
deposits were found to be rich in alkali chlorides, and no signs of 
molten phases were reported. The author pointed out that chlorine 
had  penetrated  the  scale/metal  interface  and  that  metal  oxides 
were  formed  on  the  outside  of  the  deposit/gas  interface  [164] . 
However,  it  was  not  fully  clear  how  the  corrosion  was  initiated 
and what were the reactions releasing the elemental chlorine to 
the scale/metal interface. 

Nielsen et al. [166] pointed out that the reaction of SO 

2 in the 
ﬂue gas with alkali chloride in the deposits, releases HCl and or 
chlorine, according to reactions (R19) and (R20) : 

22

2(K,Na)Cl(s) + SO 2 (g) + 1/2O 2 (g) + H 2 O(g) 

= (K,Na) 2 SO 4 (g) + 2HCl(g) 

2(K,Na)Cl(s) + SO 2 (g) + O 2 (g) = (K,Na) 2 SO 4 (s) + Cl 2 (g) 

(R19) 

(R20) 

The released HCl dissociates on the gas-deposit surface accord- 
ing  to  the  deacon  reaction  into  chlorine  which  diffuses  to  the 
metal/oxide scale interface, where it reacts with Cr and Fe form- 
ing volatile metal chlorides, such as CrCl 
2 . These species 
can  when  evaporized  diffuse  out  of  the  deposits  towards  areas 
with high partial pressures of oxygen, forming metal oxides and 
re-release  HCl(g)  or  Cl 
2 (g),  which  then  may  diffuse  back  to  the 
metal/oxide interface, thus initiating corrosion and the chlorine cy- 
cle [163,166] . 

2 and FeCl 

Numerous  laboratory  experiments  [161,167–169]  have  shown 
that solid alkali chloride deposits do not require sulfation of alkali 
chlorides in order to release chlorine to initiate the corrosion pro- 
3 , which was loose, porous, and 
2 O 
cess. Oxide scale containing Fe 
cracked, was observed growing on top of the metal substrate in 
the case of steel alloys, without SO 
2 in the ﬂue gas. Certainly, there 
must have been a reaction mechanism, involving alkali metal in 
the corrosion of the boiler tube materials. 

In  recent  years,  many  research  effort s  [170–172]  have  elabo- 
rated  the  role  of  alkali  chloride  in  the  corrosion  mechanism  of 
alloys. A short-term experimental investigation into the corrosion 
of  Fe-2.25Cr-1Mo  steel  at  40 0  °C  and  50 0  °C,  using  pure  syn- 
thetic  KCl  [170,171] ,  austenitic  stainless-steel  304-type  [173,174] , 
and FeCrAl Alloy Kanthal AF at 600  °C [175] , revealed that solid 
alkali chloride deposits react with the protective corundum-type 
(Cr,Fe) 
3 oxide formed on the surface of the steel metal, forming 
alkali chromate and ferrate, and releasing chlorine gas according to 
reactions (R21) and (R22) . This ruptures the protective oxide layer 
and exposes the alloy material beneath the oxide layer to Cl-attack. 
Chlorine diffuses to the scale/metal interface and accelerates the 
corrosion attack, as described in Section 3.6.1 .

(R24) 

Interestingly, other alkali compounds such as alkali carbonates, 
which  have  long  been  neglected  but  also  occur  in  boilers,  have 
lately been shown to be highly corrosive [176] . The corrosive action 
of potassium carbonate (K 
3 ) on 304 L stainless steel at 500  °C 
and 600 °C has been found to be similar to that of KCl. Both agents 
lead to Cr-depletion of the protective oxide scale by formation of 
potassium chromate according to reactions (R22), (R25) , and (R26) , 
thus making the steel surface less resistant to oxidation [176] :

1/2Cr 2 O 3 (s) + K 2 CO 3 (s) + 3/4O 2 (g) = K 2 CrO 4 (s) + CO 2 (g)

The aggressiveness of potassium carbonates on 304 L stainless 
steel under systematically changing temperature between 500  °C 
and 600 °C, was conﬁrmed by [172] . Evidently, the protective oxide 
3 , even when 
layer on the stainless steel may be destroyed by K 
no chloride is present, forming K

3.6.3. Corrosion by alkali chloride eutectic compounds 

Oxidation reactions involving molten chlorides are of great rel- 
evance  in  corrosion  phenomena  in  MSW-incinerators  [177]  and 
biomass  boilers  [178] .  Chemical  elements  frequently  detected  in 
signiﬁcant amounts in MSW-incineration deposits, include Cl, S, K, 
Na, Zn, Pb, and, Sn. All these elements may contribute to the for- 
mation of low-melting salt mixtures (see Table 10 ), which may ac- 
celerate metal corrosion in the low-temperature range [177] . Pure 
KCl,  NaCl,  K 
4 ,  have  melting  points  of  774,  801, 
1069, and 884  °C, respectively [51,161] . A mixture of any of these 
species  form  low-temperature  eutectics.  For  example,  NaCl/KCl, 
4  can melt at temperatures as low as 
KCl/K 
659  °C [161] , 694  °C [163] and 630  °C [179] , respectively.

The binary phase diagrams of NaCl-KCl [161] and NaCl-Na 
4 
[179] , are shown in Fig. 18 . In both cases, the trend of the melting 
shows depression with decreasing KCl and NaCl concentrations, re- 
spectively. 

Generally, a molten phase accelerate the corrosion rate by form- 
ing a ﬂux with the protective oxide layer [161,177,181] , thereby en- 
hancing the chemical reactions and product transport in the liq- 
uid phase substantially, compared to solid-solid reactions [160,163] , 
and by forming a conductive electrolyte or a pathway for ionic- 
charge transfer for electrochemical attack [51,160,182] . Despite the 
accelerated corrosion attack in the molten phase, due to high tra- 
verses of oxygen and chlorine, it is likely that the corresponding 
corrosion mechanism would be similar to that of alkali solid de- 
posits. 

The possible corrosion mechanism of metal alloys in molten al- 
kali chlorides, was presented by Li et al. [161] , who investigated 
the corrosion of Fe–35Cr- and Ni-model alloys in molten NaCl-KCl 
deposits, heated to 670  °C. The authors found that breakdown of 
the  protective  oxide  scale,  readily  occurs  by  dissolution  into  the 
melt. The corrosion by molten alkali chloride salts, proceed accord- 
ing to reactions (R27)–(R29) [161] : 

Cr 2 O 3 + 4(Na/K)Cl(l) + 5/2O 2 (g) = 2(Na/K) 2 CrO 4 (s,l) + 2Cl 2 (g) 

(R27) 

Cr 2 O 3 + 2(Na/K)Cl(l) + 2O 2 (g) = (Na/K) 2 Cr 2 O 7 (s,l) + Cl 2 (g)  (R28) 

Cr + 2(Na/K)Cl(l) + 2O 2 (g) = (Na/K) 2 CrO 4 (s,l) + Cl 2 (g) 

(R29) 

The reaction products formed, which are chromates and chlo- 
rine, act as oxidants and cause the further oxidation of Cr by the 
following reaction: 

Cr(s) + (Na/K) 2 CrO 4 (s,l) + Cl 2 (g) = Cr 2 O 3 (s) 

+ 2(Na/K)Cl(s,l,g) + 1/2O 2 (g) 

(R30) 

2 O 

Because pure chromium reacts much faster with (Na/K)Cl, than 
3 , reaction (R29) contribute rapidly to the degradation 
with Cr 
of Cr-containing alloys [161] . The reaction sequence forms a self- 
sustaining corrosion process system with no net consumption of 
alkali chloride, as indicated by reactions (R27)–(R30) [161,182] . 

Liu et al. [180] doubted the above mechanism in their exper- 
iment, which was conducted with a mixture of 98.6 wt% KCl and 

23 C 

1.4 wt% NaCl, and a mixture of 95.5 wt% KCl and 4.5 wt% NaCl, be- 
tween 450 and 750  °C on TP347H. They found that the failure of 
the alloy TP347H in molten chloride salts was mainly caused by 
grain  boundary  attack.  Their  main  argument  was  that  austenitic 
stainless steels precipitate (Cr, Fe) 
6  at grain boundaries when 
improperly heated at temperatures above 425  °C. Cr and Fe then 
become  depleted  at  grain  boundaries,  resulting  in  the  diffusion 
of  Cr  and  Fe  to  the  grain  boundaries  from  the  internal  grain 
centres, which are subsequently consumed by selective diffusion. 
Molten alkali chlorides may react with other metal chlorides at the 
metal/melt interface, forming eutectic compounds with low melt- 
ing temperatures, such as KCl–FeCl 
2 [462–
3 [202–220 °C]. Due to the high volatility and 
475 °C], and KCl–FeCl 
the presence of a concentration gradient, these low-melting eutec- 
tic compounds volatilize easily and transfer alloying elements from 
the substrate outwards to the melt/gas interface, where high oxy- 
gen partial pressure prevails, and it precipitates as oxides which 
are porous, thus accelerating the corrosion [180] .

3.6.4. Corrosion by molten alkali chloride/heavy metal compounds 

MSW-incineration releases, in addition to alkali chlorides, con- 
siderable amounts of heavy metals, such as Zn and Pb, which may 
be deposited on heat transfer surfaces [9] . Pure ZnCl 
2  and PbCl 
2 
have melting temperature of 283 °C [158] and 498 °C, respectively 
[177] . These chlorides react with alkali chlorides to form eutectic 
compounds with low melting temperatures within the deposits. 

An investigation of high-temperature corrosion by ﬂy ash de- 
posits  from  waste  incineration  plants  [177]  on  2.25Cr-1Mo  steel 
at 500  °C showed that the corrosion was signiﬁcantly accelerated. 
Analysis of the corroded metal specimen quite clearly showed the 
occurrence of a molten phase in the deposits. The melt consisted 
of  sulfates  of  Na,  K,  and  Ca  at  the  deposit/gas  phase  boundary, 
whereas  more  molten  chlorides  of  ZnCl 
2 -KCl  or  with  NaCl  were 
observed at the deposit/scale phase boundary. A very ﬁne-grained 
corrosion product containing mainly Fe and Zn was observed. Un- 
derneath this zone, a dense scale of Fe 
3 was formed. The outer

2 O 
part of the scale consisted of Fe 
thor suggested that the iron-oxide scale was dissolved in the melt 
under the low oxygen activities at the melt/oxide interface, form- 
ing FeCl

At the melt/gas interface, precipitation of the dissolved oxide 
as a zinc-containing phase takes place according to reaction (R32) , 
forming a scale which is not protective, and therefore, corrosion is 
accelerated due to the ingress of chlorine to the melt/metal inter- 
face [177] .

metal alloys maintained at 400  °C metal temperature in wood waste combustion 
(modiﬁed from [191,192] ). 

The  consumption  of  ZnCl 

2  results  in  the  enrichment  of  KCl 
in  the  molten  salt  mixture,  which  moves  through  cracks  to  the 
metal/scale  interface,  where  it  forms  eutectic  mixture  such  as 
KCl/FeCl 
2  with a melting point 355  °C. This process continues to 
keep the salt in the molten state and, thus, further dissolves the 
protective oxide scale and causes accelerated corrosion [182,183] . 

3.6.5. Inﬂuencing factors of the corrosion rate 
3.6.5.1. Flue gas temperature.  The dependence of the corrosion rate 
on the temperature has been investigated by several authors [184–
186] . The general observation is that the metal and ﬂue gas tem- 
peratures both have crucial effects on the corrosion rate. Labora- 
tory investigations revealed that the surface metal temperature has 
a very signiﬁcant effect on pure gaseous corrosion, while the ﬂue 
gas temperature has little effect on that. On the other hand, if salt 
deposits accumulate on the metal probe, the ﬂue gas temperature 
and the temperature that it imparts to the deposit has a primary 
effect on the corrosion rate [187] . Fig. 19 shows the corrosion risk 
of boiler tubes as a function of the ﬂue gas and steam temperature, 
when using steel and Inconel alloys [188] . The green region indi- 
cates the conditions under which the corrosion risk is very low, 
and WtE-boilers can therefore operate without any severe corro- 
sion challenges. The majority of current waste plants, which run 

with net electrical generation eﬃciencies of around 23%, operate 
in the green area, with steam parameters of approximately 400  °C 
and 40 bar [44] . As the ﬂue gas temperature and steam temper- 
ature increases, corrosion problems become more severe and fall 
into the red area. However, the question addressed in this section 
is; how does the ﬂue gas temperature affect the corrosion rate and, 
the mechanism of the boiler tube materials? 

Brossard et al. [190] studied the inﬂuence of the ﬂue gas tem- 
perature on carbon steel maintained at a metal temperature of 400 
°C. Fig. 20 shows the effect of the ﬂue gas temperature on the cor- 
rosion rates of various metal alloys [191,192] . The chemical com- 
positions of the alloys tested to determine the corrosion rates, are 
shown  in  Table  11 .  It  can  be  seen  that  all  the  metal  alloys  suf- 
fer an enhanced corrosion attack, with increased ﬂue gas temper- 
ature. The alloy composition of P91TS is totally different from that 
of  1.4541TS,  especially  for  Ni,  but  their  corrosion  rates  are  very 
similar.  The  likely  explanation  is  that  1.4541TS  does  not  contain 
Al and Mo, while P91TS does contain these elements, which are 
also corrosion-resistant. This makes the corrosion rate of 1.4541TS 
comparable  with  that  of  P91TS.  At  ﬂue  gas  temperatures > 650 
°C, it is suggested that higher corrosion rates are caused by the

deposit-induced corrosion and active oxidation [190] . The inﬂuence 
of the temperature on the extent of the sulfation of KCl in the de- 
posit is shown in Fig. 21 . The ﬁndings reveal that the degree of 
sulfation is higher at 560  °C than at 600  °C, which corresponds to 
3  at 560  °C com- 
the higher equilibrium conversion of SO 
pared to that at 600  °C [193] . The accelerated corrosion attack at 
higher temperatures, does not seem to correlate with the extent 
of sulfation of KCl in the deposit. Deﬁnitely, there is another rea- 
son for the accelerated corrosion attack at higher ﬂue gas temper- 
atures. A study by Brossard et al. [181] suggested that a higher ﬂue 
gas temperature causes the formation of a molten phase above the 
protective oxide scale, and hence, the faster diffusion of chlorine 
and oxygen takes place, leading to the accelerated corrosion attack. 
Nevertheless, some authors [177,181] disagree with the increase 
in  the  corrosion  rate  caused  by  molten  salt  at  higher  tempera- 
tures ( Fig. 22 ). Their view is that at higher temperatures > 650  °C, 
the  melt  phases  ﬁll  the  pores  of  the  deposit  and  thereby  block 
the transport of gaseous corrosive species. This results in the re- 
tardation of the corrosion attack. Contrary to this argument, Kin- 
nunen  et  al.  [185]  found  a  higher  corrosion  rate  in  low-alloyed 
steel 16Mo3 covered with PbCl 
2 , when it was exposed to a hot ﬂue 
gas (800 °C) compared to exposure to a lower ﬂue gas temperature 
(490 °C), with the metal temperature under both conditions, being 
maintained at 360  °C. A low-melting alkali-lead-chloride mixture 
was identiﬁed as causing the corrosion at both ﬂue gas tempera- 
tures. This supports the view that at higher ﬂue gas temperatures, 
molten phases are formed which accelerate the corrosion attack, 
as described in Sections 3.6.3 and 3.6.4 , depending on the compo- 
sition of the melt. The contradiction between the ﬁndings on cor- 
rosion rates at higher ﬂue gas temperatures may be attributed to 
the chemical compositions of the metal alloys used. 

3.6.5.2. Steam temperature.  Like ﬂue gas temperature, steam tem- 
perature  affects  the  corrosion  rate  of  the  boiler  tubes  in  WtE-

ture) on corrosion rate of various metal alloys (adapted from [197,198] ). 

facilities  signiﬁcantly.  Because  of  this  corrosion  problem,  many 
WtE  plants  operate  in  the  range  of  400–425  °C  with  40–50 bar 
steam pressure [194] which is an economic compromise between 
maximum  power  generation  and  reasonably  low  corrosion  rate. 
Some exceptional WtE-plants are using high superheater temper- 
atures > 500  °C with steam pressure ∼130 bar, such as the Ams- 
terdam WtE-plant [195] , the Bilbao WtE-plant in Spain [196] , and 
the Reno-Nord WtE-plant in Denmark [188] . Nevertheless, operat- 
ing at such high superheater temperature and steam pressure re- 
quire longer shutdown periods for maintenance and replacement 
of  corroded  superheater tubes  [195] . Fig. 22  shows the effect of 
surface metal temperature (450–600  °C) on the corrosion rate of 
various austenitic steels and ferritic steels with 12–18% Cr-content 
which are considered to be more corrosion resistant. 

At  low  temperatures  (460 °C),  the  corrosion  rates  are  modest 
while as the steam temperature increases to 525 °C, the corrosion 
rates  are  linear.  At  temperatures  ∼=  460  °C,  protective  Cr-rich  Fe 
oxide scale are formed, while around 520 °C, both protective oxide 
scales and grain boundary attack appear on the same metal alloys. 
Above  this  temperature,  Cr-depletion  and  grain  boundary  attack 
occurs [197] . At low temperatures, oxygen accelerate the oxidation 
of Cr, Fe, and Ni, which forms a dense oxide-scale composed of 
Cr 
4 , and NiO, which provide protection for the substrate 
alloy from chlorine attack.

Generally,  when  Cr-containing  steels  with  > 0.03 wt%  C  are 
heated to high temperatures > 500  °C, they precipitate (Cr, Fe) 
23 C 
6 
at grain boundaries, by a process called sensitization [199] , form- 
ing  (Cr,  Fe)-depleted  grain  boundaries  [200] .  Subsequently,  more 
C, Fe, and Cr diffuse to the grain boundaries from the grain cen- 
tres. However, since C has a higher diffusion rate, Fe and Cr near 
the grain boundaries are consumed rapidly. When the Cr-content 
becomes lower than the critical value of 12 wt% required to pro- 
vide passivation [201] , a “short-circuit” is formed, with the grain 
boundaries  serving  as  the  anodes  while  grain  centres  serves  as 
cathodes, leading to the rapid dissolution of the grain boundaries

while the grain centres remain passive [180] . Although the alloy 
P91TS in Fig. 20 contains < 10% Cr, it did not suffer serious cor- 
rosion, due to other important corrosion-resistant elements such 
as  Al  and  Mo,  being  present.  The  low  Cr-content  facilitates  the 
formation of strongly corrosion-resistant Al 
3 through the third- 
element effect (third element acts as a secondary getter for oxygen, 
thereby decreasing the inward ﬂux of oxygen into the alloy when 
the primary getter, aluminum, is removed from the surface regions 
as its oxide. Cr enables Al to diffuse to the surface from the bulk 
without precipitating out as internal oxide deep in the substrate, 
resulting in development of a healing A1 
3 layer at relatively low 
alloy aluminum concentrations) [202] . The presence of Cr in steel 
3  passi- 
improves the corrosion resistance by formation of a Cr 
vation layer, at the surface of the steel, as well as assists in the 
formation  of  a  protective  Al 
3 -scale.  A  high  metal  temperature 
melts the chlorine-containing ash deposits, which further acceler- 
ates the corrosion by the mechanism described in Section 3.6.3 or 
3.6.4 , depending on the composition of the melt salt. Chlorine pref- 
erentially attacks chromium due to chromium’s higher aﬃnity for 
chlorine than iron [198] . Because of the high volatility of chromium 
chloride, it diffuses out of the metal to regions with higher oxygen 
3 thereby releas- 
partial pressures and becomes re-oxidized to Cr 
ing Cl 
2 . Chlorine diffuses back to the corrosion front to form metal 
chlorides again. This behavior results in the voids and crevices that 
are usually observed at the grain boundaries, as well as the pres- 
ence  of  oxides  within  the  grain  centres,  where  the  oxygen  par- 
tial pressure is higher than that at the corrosion front or at the 
grain  boundaries  [197] .  A  similar  chlorination  reaction  occurs  in 
Fe  forming  FeCl 
X .  Iron  chloride  diffuses  more  rapidly  out  of  the 
corrosion  product  and  forms  oxides  above  the  chromium  oxide 
at higher oxygen partial pressures. Therefore, at low temperatures 
which do not promote the evaporation of chromium chloride, iron 
chloride still evaporates from the corrosion front and promotes the 
active  oxidation  mechanism,  whereas  as  at  higher  temperatures, 
chromium is depleted due to the formation of chromium chloride.

3.6.5.3. Effect of the waste composition.  MSW is very heterogeneous 
chemically and physically, consisting of various waste fractions, as 
shown  in  Table  1 .  Each  of  the  waste  portions  contains  different 
concentrations of ash-forming elements. The occurrence and dis- 
tribution of inorganic elements in the input waste, determine the 
transfer and distribution of these elements to the bottom ash, ﬂy 
ash,  and  ﬂue  gas  [68,87] .  For  many  years,  the  inﬂuence  of  the 
mode of occurrence of inorganic elements in waste fractions has 
been well studied, and related useful information has been gath- 
ered, while little has been determined about the effect of feeding 
different waste materials into the combustion system on the fates 
of  inorganic  elements,  particularly  alkali  compounds  and,  hence, 
their corrosive properties. 

Pedersen et al. [25] conducted a full-scale investigation of the 
partitioning of inorganic elements during the combustion of vari- 
ous Danish waste fractions, including PVC, shoes, CCA-impregnated 
wood, and, shredder wastes. Changes in the feedstock composition 
resulted in signiﬁcant changes in the vaporization and condensa- 
tion behaviors of elements and, thus, changes in the partitioning 
of the elements. As an example, ﬁring PVC resulted in organically 
bound Cl being liberated as HCl(g) to the gas phase, while inor- 
ganically bound Cl (salt) became largely bound to ash particles as 
alkali-chlorides,  and  ended  up  in  either  the  ﬂy  ash  or  the  bot- 
tom ash fraction. Moreover, an analysis of the deposit composition 
showed that shoes and PVC resulted in increased deposition ﬂuxes, 
and produced increased concentrations of Cl in the deposits, while 
shredder waste and CCA-impregnated wood led to lower concen- 
trations of Cl in the ash deposits [28] . The key ratios that affect the 
corrosion potential of the environment in the boiler when com- 
busting different waste fractions are shown in Table 12 .

The ratios—for example, (Na + K)/(2S + Cl)—indicate the avail- 
ability of alkali to form other compounds than chlorides and sul- 
fates.  When  the  waste  fraction  contains  enough  S  and  Cl,  i.e., 
(Na + K )/(2S + Cl) = 1, alkali may completely form chlorides and sul- 
fates, with the fraction of each compound type correlated with the 
amounts of Cl and S. Nonetheless, when there are small amounts 
of S and Cl, the excess alkali remaining after chlorides and sulfates 
are formed will form hydroxides and carbonates. The proportions 
of carbonates and hydroxides will be correlated with the amounts 
of  Cl  and  S.  Increasing  the  Na  and  K  concentrations  will  signif- 
icantly  affect  the  gaseous  alkali  chloride  formation  only  at  high 
Cl-levels.  Furthermore,  waste  fractions  with  (Na + K)/(2S + Cl) > 1 
and  the  lowest  S/Cl,  such  as  paper  and  meat,  produce  supe- 
rior  Cl-conversion  to  gaseous  alkali  chlorides,  while  fuels  with 
(Na + K)/(2S + Cl) < 1, such as yard waste and MSW, exhibit lower 
Cl-conversion to gaseous alkali chlorides; thus, the corrosion po- 
tential of alkali-compounds increases when burning MSW contain- 
ing large portions of PVC, glossy paper and meat [24] . Wood, yard 
waste, and shredder waste simultaneously contain less Cl and more 
S than general MSW, reasonably leading to less chloride and more 
sulfates, while meat contains more Cl and alkalis than MSW, which 
may  result  in  an  increased  corrosion  risk  when  burning  wastes 
containing large amounts of meat. 

3.7. Summary of chlorine roadmap 

2 or SO 

During MSW combustion, inorganic elements such as Ca, Na, Cl, 
and S that are organically bound in waste are  1 (cid:6) released as alkali 
chlorides and hydroxides and stay in the gas phase in the super- 
heater region. As shown in Fig. 23 ,  2 (cid:6) Ca, Na, and Cl are oxidized, 
chlorated or sulphated, resulting in the formation of hydroxides, 
oxides, and chlorides. These compounds of alkali and alkali-earth 
metals have high vapor pressures and remain in the gaseous state 
until  cooled  below  their  vaporization  temperatures.  Alkali  chlo- 
rides may  3 (cid:6) be absorbed on high-temperature surfaces of hetero- 
geneous deposits or may  4 (cid:6) homogeneously condense in the pres- 
ence of SO 
3 at lower temperatures as alkali sulfates. Due to 
the presence of other elements such as Zn,  5 (cid:6) the alkali chloride 
forms compounds with low melting temperatures that deposit di- 
rectly  on  the  metal tube  surface,  creating  a  sticky  surface.  After 
the ﬁrst layer of deposits forms, other alkali chlorides (NaCl, KCl) 
and sulfates in the ﬂue gas heterogeneously condense on top of 
the deposits formed on the heat exchange tube, forming a sticky 
meltdown  surface  which  further  accelerates  the  condensation  of 
unburned carbon and calcium to form an interface layer. After ﬁne 
ﬂy ash particles condense on the superheater with the enrichment 
of alkali metals and chlorine, hot superheater tubes above 450  °C 
are sensitive to chlorine attack, which accelerates the superheater 
corrosion. On the other hand, the volatilized inorganic vapor may 
6 (cid:6) attach onto ﬂy ash particles in the ﬂue gas, forming molten ﬂy 
ash that may stick to the metal tube surfaces.

Fig. 23.  Summary of chlorine roadmap during combustion of MSW. 

Chlorine-initiated  corrosion  in  waste  incinerators  originates 
from different species. It can originate from gaseous chlorine, al- 
kali chlorides in solid deposits, mixtures of molten alkali chlorides, 
and  eutectics  of  alkali  chlorides  with  heavy  metals.  The  sever- 
ity  of  chlorine-originated  corrosion  is  as  follows:  molten  alkali 
chloride = eutectics  mixture  of  alkali  chlorides  with  heavy  met- 
als > alkali chlorides in solid deposits > gaseous chlorine-induced 
corrosion. Alkali chlorides play a dominant role in the corrosion 
process and can react with heavy metal chlorides, forming eutectic 
compounds. Although alkali chlorides can react with Zn chlorides 
to form eutectic compounds with low melting temperatures within 
the deposits that accelerate corrosion by ﬂuxing the protective ox- 
ide scale at low temperatures of 30 0–40 0  °C, further research is 
needed to speciﬁcally compare the corrosivities of ZnCl 
2 and alkali 
chlorides. 

4. Mitigation measures 

Over several decades, a number of approaches categorized into 
primary and secondary measures have been investigated to deal 
with  Cl-induced  problems  in  waste-  and  biomass-ﬁred  boilers 
[26,36,38,44,203,204] . Primary remedies eliminate the actual cause 
of  corrosion,  rather  than  mitigating  its  effects,  and  include  co- 
combustion [26,38,205] , the use of sorbents [39,206,207] , and opti- 
mization of the process conditions, e.g., minimizing ﬂuctuations in 
the gas temperature [43–45] . Secondary measures extend the lifes- 
pan of the boiler tube components, by mitigating the adverse ef- 
fects of corrosion and include the use of corrosion-resistant alloys 
and coatings [44,46,208] . 

4.1. Co-combustion 

Avoiding the deposition of chlorides of alkali and heavy met- 
als on the surface of the boiler tube metals, is a traditional ap- 
proach of preventing corrosion during waste-incineration and can 
be achieved by the co-combustion of waste with fuel rich in sul- 
fur or alumina-silicates [38,205,209] . Currently, the majority of co- 
combustion  processes  for  wastes  or  biomass  materials  with  ei- 
ther coal or sewage sludge are performed in ﬂuidized-bed and/or 
pulverized  combustors  [51] ,  while  less  on  grates.  The  sulfation 
and aluminum-silication of chlorides are important reactions dur- 
ing co-combustion processes which decrease Cl-related operational 
problems.  Aluminum  silicate  and  sulfur  dioxide  react  with  chlo- 
rides of alkalis or alkali earth metals and capture the alkali while 
releasing HCl, which does not condense on boiler tube materials 
[39] . Therefore, by appropriately mixing wastes with fuels rich in 
aluminum silicate or sulfur, alkali chloride deposition and, hence, 
corrosion can be prevented or at least minimized. However, it is 
not well understood which reaction, whether sulfation or alumina- 
silication, plays the dominant role in the sequestration of chlorides 
during the co-combustion of waste with coal or sewage sludge. Ad- 
ditionally, it is not clear whether heavy metals, particularly chlo- 
rides, contained in large amounts in solid wastes are also captured 
during the co-combustion of wastes. 

Manninen et al. [210] co-combusted refuse-derived fuel (RDF) 
with coal for one year in a MSW-incineration power plant. They 
found that heavy metals were concentrated into the ﬂy ash in an 
unleachable form. No excess fouling was noticed compared to nor- 
mal combustion of RDF alone. The Cl-content of the deposits was

Fig. 24.  Comparison of the amounts of ash-forming elements found in deposits after the co-combustion of RDF with either South African coal (SAC) or Polish coal (PC) at 
tube temperatures of 500 and 420 °C (adapted from [211] ). 

reduced due to the capture of alkali chlorides by the mineral com- 
ponents of coal ash, which are rich in Al, Si, and Ca, and the sulfa- 
tion of alkali chlorides during co-combustion [210] . The amounts of 
inorganic elements found in the deposits after the co-combustion 
of  RDF  with  different  types  of  coals  are  shown  in  Fig.  24  [211] . 
Among the coal mineral elements, Al and Si present the strongest 
effects, indicating that the protective power of coal originates from 
the reactions of alumina-silicates, due to their high concentration 
in coal, with alkali chlorides to form alkali alumina-silicate, while 
sulfur has low impact. The results were conﬁrmed by Aho and Fer- 
rer [66] , who investigated the major pathway of capturing alkali 
chlorides during the co-combustion of meat and bone meal with 
different types of coals, i.e., South African coal, German coal, and 
Polish coal. When each of the coals was added to meat and bone 
meal in different ratios, the amount of S detected in the deposits, 
was very small compared with the amounts of  Al and Si, while 
Ca, although found in large amounts, was mainly associated with 
S, as CaSO 
4 . Apart from alkali chloride capture, the trace elements 
undergo reactions with both ash particles and gaseous species, re- 
sulting in the retention of trace elements in large ﬂy ash particles 
and, hence, a decrease in the corrosion rate [212] . 

However,  some  researchers  [107,213]  believe  that  the  co- 
combustion  of  waste  with  coal  or  sewage  sludge  enhances  the 
volatility  of  heavy  metals,  mainly,  Zn,  Pb,  and  Cd,  which  may 
greatly enhance the corrosion of the boiler tube metals. Their ar- 
gument is based on the fact that the mineral elements, such as Si 
and Al, prefer to react with alkali chlorides, releasing gaseous chlo- 
rine, which shifts the distribution of trace elements such as Zn, Pb, 
and Cd towards more volatile chlorides, thus promoting their va- 
porization, especially at ﬂue gas temperatures > 700  °C. This tran- 
sition inhibits the reactions between vaporized heavy metals and 
coal  minerals,  such  as  kaolinite.  Nevertheless,  it  has  been  found 
by [212] that the addition of ammonium sulfate and kaolinite to 
mixed solid recovered fuel (SRF) and coal, in order to increase the 
content of mineral elements in the fuel, reduces the volatility of 
heavy metals, as well as alkali metals, due to the chemical reac- 
tions between the trace elements and the additives. These ﬁndings 
were further conﬁrmed by Vainio et al. [26] , who co-combusted 
bark, solid recovered fuel, and sewage sludge, and by Guo et al. 
[214] ,  who  co-combusted  municipal  sewage  sludge  with  Sedum 

2 O 

4 (s), ZnFe 

2  to form PbSiO 

plumbizincicola (a plant used to absorb heavy metals from contam- 
inated soil). In their experiments, gaseous heavy metals were not 
detected, while substantial amounts of heavy metals were found 
in the bottom ash, mainly existing as silicates and aluminates. In 
light of these ﬁndings, Guo et al. [214] further studied the behav- 
iors  of  Zn  and  Pb  in  the  presence  of  oxides  of  Si  and  Al.  Lead 
3 (s), while Zn forms 
was found to react with SiO 
ZnAl 
3 (s), thus leading to the 
absence of heavy metals or their presence in concentrations be- 
low the detection limits. The reactions of chlorides of alkali metals 
with heavy metals release HCl, which does not condense on metal 
tubes, but is emitted through the stack. While the co-combustion 
of  waste  materials  with  coal  or  sludge  captures  chlorides  of  al- 
kali  metals  and  heavy  metals,  more  research  is  needed  on  the 
(Al + Si)/(Na + K + Zn + Pb) molar ratio, which should promote the 
effective capture of alkali and heavy metal chlorides to reduce cor- 
rosion problems.

4.2. Optimization of the combustion environment 

The operating conditions in a boiler, such as the primary and 
secondary air injection, air/fuel ratio, homogenous fuel composi- 
tion  and  feeding  rate,  affect  the  ash  deposition  and  boiler  tube 
corrosion failures, due to the promotion of complete combustion, 
the volatilization of elements, the inhibition of temperature ﬂuc- 
tuations  and  the  good  mixing  of  ﬂue  gasses  [186] .  Optimization 
of  the  combustion  conditions  in  the  plant  has  recently  emerged 
as  a  method  that  may  reduce  the  corrosion  problems  in  MSW- 
incineration plants. 

Among  the  main  approaches,  the  Segher  boiler  prism,  which 
optimize the combustion environment in waste incineration plants 
[45] ,  have  been  identiﬁed  as  a  primary  measure  against  high- 
temperature  boiler  corrosion.  The  system  consists  of  a  prism- 
shaped dynamic secondary air mixer that is inserted at the tran- 
sition of the combustion chamber to the ﬁrst radiant boiler pass 
and is water-cooled, refractory lined, and integrated with the nat- 
ural circulation system. The Segher boiler prism divides the ﬂue 
gas  into  two  channels,  into  each  of  which  secondary  air  is  in- 
jected from two different locations that are the boiler wall and the 
prism. The prism allows for a more uniform injection of secondary

29 

air through multiple nozzles in the prism sides and boiler walls, 
which ensures high turbulence and optimal mixing, and, thereby, 
facilitates the sulfation reaction [215] , which lowers the reaction 
tendency of the deposits and reduces the corrosion potential [45] . 
Additionally, the prism results in a highly uniform distribution of 
the ﬂue gas speed, temperature and oxygen in the cross-sections of 
the ﬁrst boiler pass, shortly above the prism, thereby avoiding the 
establishment of hot spots [44] . The prism extracts heat from the 
combustion zone and limits the combustion temperature, which in 
turn, minimizes the volatilization of chlorides of alkali and heavy 
metals, eventually leading to the formation of less-chemically cor- 
rosive deposits [45,215] . 

Perilleux and Earaerts [216] studied the effect of implementing 
the  Segher  boiler  prism  to  address  ash-related  problems  caused 
by insuﬃcient mixing and burnout of the ﬂue gasses in the com- 
bustion  area.  The  author  observed  that  the  temperature  became 
uniformly  distributed  within  the  boiler  after  prism  implementa- 
tion  and  dropped  by  [25  -  30  °C].  The  increased  uniformity  of 
the temperature proﬁle allowed an increase in the waste through- 
put  by  6–10%.  Based  on  visual  inspections  of  corrosion  in  loca- 
tions where corrosion rates are normally the highest, such as at 
the  superheater  and  boiler  roofs,  the  author  found  that  no  se- 
vere  damage  had  occurred,  and  no  corrosion-related  shutdowns 
were  reported.  Similar  results  were  found  by  Adams  et  al.  [45] , 
who installed a Segher boiler prism in a WtE-plant in Moerdijk, 
the Netherlands, which treat a total of 70 0,0 0 0 tons of municipal 
waste annually. Corrosion-related shutdowns were not experienced 
within the time period of the investigation. The author found that 
sulfation in the boiler with the prism installed, took place earlier 
than in the boiler without prism, which subsequently led to the 
reduced corrosion rate. 

Other technologies that can be used in the optimization of pro- 
cess parameters include a mixed secondary air injection conﬁgu- 
ration [217] and Ecotubes [218] . The mixed secondary air injection 
conﬁguration consists of two rows of over-ﬁre air nozzles on the 
front  and  the  rear  of  the  furnace  to  ensure  good  mixing  of  the 
gas ﬂows. It also has nozzles on the lateral walls of the furnace 
to generate a swirling ﬂow, which enables good homogeneity of 
the ﬂow and increases the residence time [186] . Ecotube systems 
generate a local intensive mixing zone due to the fast movement 
of  gasses  created  by  multiple,  high-velocity  air  jets.  As  a  result, 
this strong mixing within the boiler minimizes the reduction con- 
ditions, causes high-velocity laminar ﬂow, reduces metal and gas 
temperatures,  and,  ﬁnally,  decreases  the  corrosion  of  the  super- 
heaters [218] . However, literature on the eﬃciencies of these tech- 
nologies in the minimization of chlorine- and ash-related problems 
in  waste  combustion  boilers  is  scarce,  and  if  the  temperature  is 
slightly reduced, the boiler electrical generation eﬃciency maybe 
compromised; therefore, ways to reduce corrosion impacts using 
Segher boiler prisms, Ecotube systems, and mixed secondary air in- 
jection conﬁgurations without reducing the boiler eﬃciency should 
also be considered. 

4.3. Corrosion-resistant alloys 

Over  the  past  years,  many  kinds  of  corrosion-resistant  alloys 
have been developed and tested. Generally, at temperatures < 350 
°C, carbon steel is used [190] . In the high-temperature region > 400 
°C, high-Cr and -Mo Ni-base alloys and high-Cr, high-Si ferronickel 
alloy tubing products, are used in WtE-plants [43,48] . Because Cr 
has a high aﬃnity for oxygen, alloying with suﬃcient Cr improves 
the corrosion resistance of the alloy material, as it is able to form 
a protective oxide-layer consisting of either a corundum-type solid 
solution,  or,  if  there  is  enough  chromium  in  the  steel,  a  pure 
3 -layer may be formed [51,162] . As the number and amount 
Cr 
of different alloying elements in the materials increase, the corro-

based steel in 500 ppm HCl and O 2 (reprinted from [162] with permission of Else- 
vier). 

sion resistance of a material towards high-temperature corrosion is 
altered. 

Zahs et al. [162,219] systematically studied the roles played by 
individual alloy elements (Fe, Cr and Ni) in Fe-based steel and Ni- 
based steel in HCl and O 
2  at temperatures between 40 0–70 0  °C. 
The authors found that Fe, Cr, and Ni have different inﬂuences on 
the corrosion resistance of alloys in HCl-containing environments, 
as depicted in Fig. 25 . At the low temperature of approximately 
400  °C, the corrosion behaviors of Fe-15Cr and Fe-35Cr were very 
similar. Signiﬁcant differences occur at 500  °C, at which point Fe- 
35Cr showed a lower corrosion rate than Fe-15Cr. The scale on Fe- 
35Cr was observed to be the same as that at 400  °C, while in the 
case of Fe-15Cr, non-protective oxides were formed by active oxi- 
dation. 

Within the separate oxide layers, the Cr-content increases in the 
direction toward the metal, since gaseous chromium chlorides are 
converted to oxides at lower oxygen partial pressures than gaseous 
iron chlorides. This implies that increasing the Cr-content some- 
how improved the corrosion resistance of the iron-based steel at 
500  °C.  In  addition  to  the  amount  of  Cr  in  the  steel,  the  tem- 
perature plays a signiﬁcant role in the corrosion resistance of Fe- 
and  Ni-based  steel.  Upon  increasing  the  temperature  to  700  °C, 
better  corrosion  resistance  of  the  iron-chromium  alloys  was  ob- 
served compared to that at 600  °C. Chromium diffuses faster at 
higher temperatures, leading to the formation of a denser oxide 
scale with fewer diffusion paths for the transport of chlorine from 
the gas phase to the metal surface and for the outward diffusion 
of  gaseous  metal  chlorides from  the  metal/scale interface to  the 
scale/gas interface, thereby allowing less active oxidation [162,219] . 
With increasing Ni-contents, less active oxidation takes place, es- 
pecially at 600  °C [162] . The preferential removal of more-reactive 
elements, such as Fe and Cr, results in Ni-enriched zones of the 
metal. Similar ﬁndings were found in the case of Mo by Zahs et al. 
[219] ,  who  used  the  ferritic  Fe-15Cr-10Mo  alloy  at  500  and  600 
°C in O 
2 and HCl and observed that Fe and Cr were preferentially 
attacked, leading to a molybdenum-rich metal zone beneath the 
metal surface. 

A  further  investigation  on  the  effect  of  the  amount  of  Cr  in 
the alloy material was conducted by Ma et al. [220] , who studied 
the high-temperature corrosion of pure Fe and Cr, and Fe-Cr bi- 
2 -containing KCl vapor at 750  °C. Their results re- 
nary alloys in O 
vealed that the corrosion rate of Fe-Cr alloys is reduced as the con- 
centration of Cr increases. In KCl-containing environments, Cr and 
Cr 
3  react with KCl, forming potassium chromate while liberat- 
ing chlorine. This process cracks the protective scale, allowing the 
diffusion of chlorine to the metal/scale interface, where it forms

volatile metal chlorides, which evaporate and diffuse outwards to 
the scale/gas interface, and are re-oxidized there, forming a mul- 
3 layer and an outer 
tilayer oxide scale consisting of an inner Cr 
Fe 
3 layer [221] . In fact, the corrosion behaviors of steel materi- 
als are controlled by the relation between Cr-losses by evaporation 
and the supply of Cr to the oxides, by diffusion into the alloy. If 
the Cr-content decreases below the critical value (usually 12 wt%) 
needed  for  passivation,  or,  when  the  Cr-supply  rate  cannot  bal- 
ance the evaporation rate, the protective scale becomes severely 
depleted in chromium, leading to rapid oxidation [180] . 

2 O 

Li et al. [222] elaborated the inﬂuence of adding Al and Si to Fe- 
Cr alloys in KCl-contaminated air environments. From their results, 
it is deduced that the addition of Si to Fe-Cr alloys improves the 
corrosion resistance of Fe-Cr alloy better than the addition of Al, 
which again performed better than Ni. Silicon forms a protective, 
stable and dense oxide-scale in the inner zone, which precludes 
the rapid growth of iron oxides. The addition of aluminum to the 
alloy  improves  the  corrosion  resistance  by  forming  a  dense  alu- 
minum chromium oxide mixture, which prevents corrosion attack 
in the initial stage [222] . Nevertheless, in environments contain- 
ing alkali chlorides, the chromium from the surface oxide layer is 
transformed into alkali chromate, and subsequently, non-protective 
porous iron oxide is formed [161,222] . 

The ﬁndings reported by Li and co-workers [161,222] were sup- 
ported  by  thermodynamic  equilibrium calculations  conducted  by 
Bender and Schütze [223] , who found that Ni is the most resis- 
tant element in reducing atmospheres, because the formation of 
2  has  a  lower  Gibbs  free  energy  of  formation  −174.2 kJ/mol 
NiCl 
2 −232.1 kJ/mol at 600  °C and CrCl 
at 600  °C than those of FeCl 
2 
−286.0 kJ/mol at 600  °C, and damage from the formation of NiCl 
2 
is less marked than that from Fe and Cr [162,223] . In combustion 
environments with low oxygen and high chlorine partial pressures, 
the high volatility of iron and chromium chlorides, lead to a strong 
corrosive attack of the material [219,223] . In contrast, under high 
oxygen partial pressure and low chlorine partial pressure, Al, Si, 
and Ti form stable and dense oxide scales, such as SiO 
3 , and 
TiO 

2 , that are resistant to chlorine-induced corrosion [222,223] . 
Based on these ﬁndings, the most corrosion-resistant material 
should  consist  of  a  Ni-based  material,  forming  a  dense  titanate, 
alumina  or  silica  scale.  Underneath  the  scale,  where  the  oxygen 
partial pressure is very low, a Ni-base will perform better, while 
on top of the scale, where the oxygen partial pressure is high, alu- 
mina or silica will suppress the chlorine attack. Meanwhile, other 
alloying elements such as Co, Nb and W, which may have corrosion 
resistance abilities, should also be given more attention.

4.4. MSW with less chlorine input 

To eﬃciently incinerate MSW in WtE-plants with minimum of 
adverse effects from chlorine, it is more vital to control the Cl-load 
prior to combustion, such as by removing the alkali chlorides and 
separating plastics, than to minimize its damage in the boiler by 
chemical dechlorination and catalytic separation. Intense research 
has focused on understanding the relationships between the ori- 
gin of Cl in the feed and the formation of HCl. To determine the 
amount of HCl emitted from PVC, an MSW mixture without a PVC 
fraction was combusted, which showed that the HCl-emission was 
reduced by 40% to 1.7 mg Cl/g wet MSW [53] . Delay et al. [224] in- 
dicated that the reduction of disposable plastics, in particular, PVC, 
in waste streams is important, ﬁrst to avoid the presence of metals 
such as Pb, Cd, and Zn and second, to minimize the formation of 
chlorides that are easily leachable, at the surface of ﬂy ash parti- 
cles. At present, the most widely used and accepted techniques for 
separating mixed plastics are based on density. In consideration of 
accuracy, three advanced separation processes—the sink-ﬂoat pro- 
cess and centrifuge and hydrocyclone separation—were used to de- 

termine  how  each  process  would  distribute  the  Cl  contained  in 
plastic waste to the overﬂow and underﬂow. They concluded that 
by  the  current  sorting  technology,  13%  of  mixed  waste  plastics 
go  to WtE  plants, 35% to  recycling,  and 52%  to  landﬁlling. With 
the sink-ﬂoat separation technology, 47.5% of chlorine-poor plastic 
( < 0.5%) goes to WtE-plants as an alternative fuel, and 16.9% (ca 
4.7% Cl content) goes to landﬁlling. 

As  far  as  the  inorganic  chloride  salt  is  concerned,  a  water- 
washing process, which is a simple but eﬃcient method for the 
removal of chlorine, may be used. Several studies on biomass or 
coal washing have also shown that a large portion of Cl could be 
released by elution tests. Jensen et al. [225] found that ∼90% of the 
chlorine was released from biomass char within 20 min by water 
washing. Chen and Pagano [226] reported that a high-chlorine coal 
(0.5 wt.%) could meet the chlorine design criterion of 0.2 wt% coal 
by the application of a high-temperature (93.7  °C) leaching tech- 
nique.  During  an  18-h  water  extraction  at  ambient  temperature, 
nearly 80% of the chlorine was released [227] . In MSW, approxi- 
mately 85% of easily water-soluble chlorine was leached out in the 
ﬁrst washing procedure using distilled water [82] . The limitation of 
the water extraction method is in increasing the total cost of the 
operations, as well as in the disposal of the eﬄuent. 

4.5. Sorbents 

When chlorine is released into the gaseous phase as HCl, al- 
kali  chlorides,  or  heavy  metal  chlorides  during  waste  combus- 
tion [51] , it readily reacts with other available components, which, 
in  turn,  affects  its  corrosive  power  in  the  boiler.  Sorbents  often 
available in waste material or added into the combustion system 
change the corrosive properties of chlorine-based species by react- 
ing with either alkali chlorides or heavy metal chlorides to form 
metal-sorbent  species  with  relatively  high  melting  temperatures, 
while HCl(g) is released to the ﬂowing ﬂue gas. HCl(g) is a vapor 
throughout the boiler and is thus discharged together with the ﬂue 
gas through the stack [204] . Fig. 26 illustrates the inﬂuence of sor- 
bents on the chemistry of alkali chlorides. 

Different kinds of sorbents, e.g., sulfate-containing sorbents, or 
elemental sulfur can be utilized to alter the corrosive properties of 
alkali chlorides by transforming them into alkali sulfates through 
either  homogeneous  gas-phase  reactions  [119]  or  heterogeneous 
(solid- or liquid-phase) reactions proposed for the formation of al- 
kali sulfates from alkali chlorides in deposits [21,228] . One sulfate- 
containing  sorbent  has  been  patented  [40] ,  and  the  process  is 
called the ChlorOut concept. This concept uses ammonium sulfate 
4 ) to reduce the corrosive tendencies of alkali chlorides 
((NH 
in the boiler. In this process, an aqueous solution of ammonium 
sulfate is sprayed in the turbulent zone at the entrance of the su- 
perheater to induce the sulfation of gaseous alkali chlorides in the 
ﬂue gas. Initially, ammonium sulfate decomposes into NH 
3 and SO 
3 
3 (g) reacts 
according to reaction (R35) . After the decomposition, SO

alkali sulfates, which will condense on the tube metals:

less than 0.5, compared to SO

from the average concentration of 30 ppm to 5 ppm (S/Cl = 2.1) and 
to 2 ppm (S/Cl = 3.5) when using (NH 
4 but only to 10 ppm at 
an S/Cl molar ratio of 6.4 when using sulfur. This method has been 
well used in biomass combustion [41,204] , and its effectiveness in 
municipal and industrial wastes combustion, has been conﬁrmed 
by Viklund et al. [206] . The concentration of alkali chlorides in the 
ﬂue gas and deposits on cooled superheater probes during com- 
bustion experiments was greatly reduced after adding ammonium 
sulfate to the waste boiler. Analyses of the tube deposits showed 
that the sides of the tubes facing the ﬂue gas were covered with 
calcium-rich deposits, while relatively more sodium and potassium 
were present on the leeward side. Their results show that ammo- 
nium  sulfate  shifted  the  deposit  composition  from  chloride-rich, 
which  is  highly  corrosive,  to  one  signiﬁcantly  less  corrosive  and 
dominated by sulfates of sodium, potassium and calcium. 

Further investigation into the alteration of the chemistry of Cl- 
based compounds by ammonium sulfate in the waste boiler with 
changes in temperature was conducted by Becidan et al. [92] . Ac- 
cording to their results, high additive levels exhibited 100% con- 
version of alkali chlorides to sulfates, in the temperature range of 
750–800  °C, but when the temperature was increased to 1100  °C, 
the conversion eﬃciency decreased to 0%. However, the capture of 
NaCl differs from that of KCl when reacting with ammonium sul- 
fate, especially at higher temperatures, as shown in Fig. 27 . As il- 
lustrated, the optimal range for NaCl removal is 80 0–90 0 °C, while 
the optimal range for KCl removal is 750–850 °C. It is possible that 
the temperature operating range for NaCl, is greater than the tem- 
perature operating range for KCl [92] , which still needs further re- 
search. 

2 or SO 

Apart from the homogeneous gas-phase sulfation reactions of 
alkali chlorides by SO 
3 , a heterogeneous gas-solid sulfation 
mechanism of chloride deposits is also possible. Below the temper- 
ature of 650  °C, the heterogeneous reactions are principally con- 
trolled by the physical adsorption of the reacting gasses because 
of low activation energies; nevertheless, at > 650  °C, the reactions 
change  from  gas-solid  reactions  to  gas-liquid  reactions,  possibly 
because of the phase transition from a solid to eutectic mixtures of 
sulfates and potassium chloride [51] . The heterogeneous sulfation 
mechanism was suggested by Henriksson and Warnqvist [228] and 
later adopted and modiﬁed by Boonsongsup et al. [21] for the sul- 
fation of alkali chlorides in deposits by SO 

2 is as follows: 

SO 2 (g) = SO 2 (ads)

4.6. Summary 

Several  effort s  have  been  carried  out  to  mitigate  the  Cl- 
initiated corrosion in waste incineration and biomass combustion 
boilers.  The  approaches  can  be  categorized  into  primary  effort s 
(those effort s that remove the actual cause of corrosion, e.g., co- 
combustion, the inclusion of additives and combustion optimiza- 
tion), and, secondary effort s (effort s that prolong the lifetime the 
boiler, e.g., the use of advanced corrosion-resistant alloys and coat- 
ings). 

The co-combustion of MSW with coal eliminates the cause of 
corrosion,  due  to  alumina-silication  and  sulfation  processes.  Due 
to the larger concentrations of Al and Si in coal than S, alumina- 
silication is the dominant pathway for corrosion mitigation, dur- 
ing MSW/coal co-combustion. Several additives/sorbents including 
ammonium sulfates, sand, kaolinite and elemental S have been ex- 
amined to mitigate the corrosion problem in combustion boilers. 
The general mode of corrosion mitigation occurs by capturing al- 
kali metals that release chlorine as HCl, which becomes lost in the 
ﬂue gas and emitted through the chimney. 

The  Segher  boiler  prism  extracts  heat  from  the  incineration 
zone, and limits the incineration temperature, which in turn min- 
imizes the volatilization of chloride salts and, hence, leads to the 
formation of less-corrosive deposits. It also allows the uniform in- 
jection of secondary air into the boiler walls, which promotes in- 
cineration optimization by promoting high turbulence of the ﬂue 
gas,  optimal  mixing,  uniform  distribution  of  the  ﬂue  gas  speed, 
and prevention of the creation of hot spots. This combustion opti- 
mization promotes sulfation reactions to take place, which lessens 
the reactivity of the deposits, and, reduces the corrosion potential. 
However, the eﬃciency of this technology considering the boiler 
electrical  eﬃciency  needs  to  be  examined,  since  the  technology 
lowers the boiler temperature to prevent the volatilization of chlo- 
ride, but boiler eﬃciency requires a higher temperature. 

Advanced  corrosion-resistant  alloys  may  extend  the  life  of 
boiler  tube  metals,  but  will  often  also  make  the  boiler  mate- 
rial a lot more expensive. Metal elements such as Cr, have been 
proved to form a passivation oxide-scale that protects the under- 
2 O 
lying  metal  substrate.  Cr  also  facilitates  the  formation  of  Al

not react with the metal substrate. Even though the heterogeneous 
sulfation  reaction  is  slow  [21] ,  and  is  considered  less  signiﬁcant 
in altering the corrosive properties of alkali chlorides, it should be 
valued since it can also alter the deposit chemistry to a less corro- 
sive state, as conﬁrmed by Kassman and co-workers [41,203,229] , 
during biomass combustion. Fig. 28 shows a comparison of the re- 
sults of peat rich in sulfur and elemental sulfur during the sulfa- 
tion of KCl. Although the addition of peat, which has a higher S/Cl, 
yields a better performance in reducing the amount of KCl in ﬂue 
gas and Cl in deposits compared with elemental sulfur, it is also as- 
sumed that chlorine in the deposits is reduced by K-capture with 
ash minerals in parallel to sulfation in the case of peat [41] . 

In  addition  to  S-based  sorbents,  kaolin  has  been  reported  as 
a  sorbent  that  has  a  great  ability  to  change  the  chemistry  of 
chlorides  in  the  boiler  [230–232] .  During  combustion,  kaolinite 
in  kaolin  decomposes  at  > 450  °C,  releasing  water  and  form- 
ing  an  amorphous  mixture  of  alumina  and  silica  called  meta- 
kaolinite [166] . The meta-kaolinite changes the gaseous alkali chlo- 
ride species released from the waste, into alkali aluminum silicates 
with high melting temperatures according to the possible reactions 
shown below [51,207,230,232] :

and 1500  °C, respectively [178] , and pure NaAlSiO 
has a melting point of 1526  °C [233] , which causes alkali to be- 
comes  less  problematic  for  the  boiler  operation  in  comparison 
with, for example, KCl, which has a melting temperature of approx- 
imately 770  °C [51,207] . 

Like ChlorOut, the use of SiO 

2 for altering the chemistry of al- 
kali chlorides during solid fuel combustion, has also been patented 
[42] . In this patent, dust or glass powder is sprayed into the com- 
bustion chamber at temperatures > 700 °C. The selected glass has a 
melting point below 10 0 0 °C. The physical and chemical properties 
2 are optimized to obtain a material with a high surface area 
of SiO 
in order to maximize the gas/particle contact and reactivity and 
produce a relatively low melting point, so that the particles will 
partly melt, which will favor inter-reactions between the gas, ﬂy

through the third-element effect. Other refractory elements such as 
Si and Ti also form protective oxides, which reduce the corrosion- 
impact.  The  disadvantage  of  protective  oxides  is  that  at  certain 
temperatures, the oxides can further react with oxygen and evap- 
orate, resulting in the protectiveness of the scale being lost. For 
example,  at  temperatures > 850  °C,  Cr 
3  reacts  with  oxygen,  to 
form volatile CrO 
3 , which limits the long-term application of Cr- 
containing alloys to temperatures approximately 900 °C. Like Cr, 
2  concentration, Si forms volatile SiO, leading to the 
under low O 
removal of the protective SiO 
2  layer. Other elements such as Mo 
possess strong corrosion resistance abilities, particularly under re- 
ducing conditions; however, under an oxidizing environment, they 
form volatile oxychlorides.

5. Future prospects and challenges 

The present work aims for a deeper understanding, interpreta- 
tion, and analysis of the fate of Cl during the thermal treatment of 
municipal solid waste, in particular, its origin, occurrence, vapor- 
ization, deposition, and corrosion processes. Based on the ﬁndings 
of this study, a number of research questions have been identiﬁed 
for future works. 

Future  research  work  should  be  directed  towards  various  is- 
sues and research ﬁelds. The heterogeneous nature of MSW causes 
some diﬃculties in determining Cl-concentrations and association 
in waste. Numerous analytical methods have been established to 
analyze Cl in waste, e.g., the Schoeniger ﬂask method, quartz fur- 
nace  methods  for  the  differentiation  of  combustible  and  incom- 
bustible  chlorine,  and  spectroscopic  methods,  e.g.,  X-ray  ﬂuores- 
cence. The diﬃculty in the techniques used is not only in deﬁning 
a cost-effective procedure, but also in providing reliable and accu- 
rate results. A fundamental aspect required in terms of the method 
performance is the ability to provide an interference-free measure- 
ment  during  routine  analyses.  Combustion  coupled  with  IC  was 
previously recommended as the ideal method for the analysis of Cl 
in MSW. The basic principle is to volatilize all Cl contained in the 
solid waste as ions that are captured in the absorbent solution, di- 
lute the solution to a certain volume, and analyze it by IC, in order 
to obtain the Cl-concentration, which is then used to calculate the 
Cl-content in the solid sample. The challenge in this approach is 
that some gaseous chlorides, particularly alkali chlorides, are vola- 
tized and may condense, forming deposits on the inside walls of 
the furnace. This portion of chlorides should be considered in fu- 
ture works as combustible, since it is initially volatilized. 

The data on waste fuels, aerosols, and ﬂy ash from boilers ﬁring 
several different types of wastes and biofuels, illustrate that there 
is no clear correlation between the release of Cl and alkali metals. 
This indicates that Cl-vaporization involves several elements, such 
as Zn, Pb, Ca, Si, P, Mg, etc. An in-depth study to further improve 
our understanding of the chemistry behind the vaporization of Cl 
which includes several different elements is urgently required, as 
this will assist in implementing suitable methods to control or cap- 
ture the Cl released during combustion processes. 

Another research direction involves the particle sticking behav- 
iors  of  sub-micron  particles.  During  deposit  formation,  particles 
stick  to  the  boiler  tube  surface  or  to  the  deposit  layer  initially 
formed  when  the  temperature  decreases.  Studies  on  the  stick- 
ing behaviors of particles are rare, and in-depth investigations are 
needed to shed more light on the process that occurs between the 
particle and the boiler tube surface or ash deposits. The threshold 
of a particle sticking onto the boiler tube surface or the initially 
formed  deposits  should  be  taken  into  account  for  different  par- 
ticle sizes and chemical compositions and then linked to particle 
properties such as the melt fraction and kinetic energy dissipation. 
Moreover, in real WtE-plants, clean boiler tubes are rarely found; 
therefore, thorough research on particles impacting a deposit layer 

is  essential  to  improve  the  understanding  of  the  impaction  tak- 
ing place in real power plants. The challenge associated with this 
research ﬁeld is that ash particles are minute and are extremely 
hard to observe with normal optical cameras. Therefore, methods 
for detecting and observing the impaction process, as well as the 
sticking process onto deposits and/or boiler tubes, should be iden- 
tiﬁed. The mechanisms of the formation of coarse ﬂy ash particles 
are still not clear. Since MSW contains large amounts of volatile 
species, the formation of large ash particles should be studied at 
each stage of combustion, that is, during the devolatilization, py- 
rolysis/gasiﬁcation,  and  char  burnout  stages.  This  aids  in  under- 
standing the interactions of mineral elements (like Al, Si), Ca, Cl, 
S, and alkali species and the formation of coarse ﬂy ash. 

Aside from experimental investigations, the rate of ash deposi- 
tion under certain operational conditions should be studied and ki- 
netically modeled. To model the deposition when ﬁring MSW, de- 
tailed  fuel  data  on  several  elements  including  Si,  Al,  Zn,  and  Fe 
should be studied in order to understand their release behaviors 
from MSW during incineration. Therefore, the fuel elements’ oc- 
currence, associations, and distribution should be studied using ad- 
vanced analytical tools, e.g., computer-controlled scanning electron 
microscopy. The compositions of individual particles are crucial for 
developing a useful and reliable ash formation model. These data 
would be used as input data in the model. 

Another important ﬁeld of research is on Cl-induced corrosion. 
The basic theory of the Cl-initiated corrosion mechanism is active 
oxidation. In this mechanism, the elementary reactions and their 
reaction rate constants have not been established. To establish the 
reaction pathways, the kinetic modeling of high-temperature cor- 
rosion, is needed to predict the corrosion rates of different metals 
in different combustion environments. This will help plant opera- 
tors decide on proper metal alloys to be installed as superheater 
tubes in appropriate corrosive environments. The great challenge 
here  is  that  full-scale  experimental  data  on  speciﬁc  parameters 
such as the effect of a single ﬂue gas component on the corrosion 
rate, to check the accuracy of the model, are still not published in 
the literature. Nevertheless, experimental studies on the identiﬁ- 
cation of the alloy requirements for increased corrosion resistance 
to speciﬁc corrosive environments encountered in the convective 
section  or  furnace  walls  can  be  performed  for  comparison  with 
the model. This will aid in material selection for power plants, as 
well as in indicating the requirements for higher-temperature oper- 
ations. Additionally, there is a need to accurately diagnose and doc- 
ument boiler tube failures to ascertain their origin, such as design-, 
fuel-, or operation-originated failures, so that proper methods are 
implemented to correct them. A vital approach should be focused 
on the development of in situ monitoring systems to detect inﬂu- 
encing parameters (temperature, ﬂue gas velocity, ﬂue gas compo- 
sition, etc.) affecting high-temperature corrosion. 

6. Concluding remarks 

Although  MSW-incineration  mostly  in  grate-ﬁred  boilers  has 
been globally adopted to process waste and recover energy from 
it,  the  technology  continues  to  face  intractable  Cl-related  prob- 
lems.  The  focus  of  this  review  has  been  to  shed  more  light  on 
the fate of Cl during MSW-incineration, along with its origins and 
species. Several analytical methods have been compared according 
to sample preparation, analytical duration and accuracy. The pa- 
per presents the theories behind Cl-release, deposit formation, Cl- 
induced corrosion, and discuss potential methods to mitigate Cl- 
associated problems during MSW-incineration. Additionally, the in- 
terrelationships of Cl with alkali metals, heavy metals, and S were 
discussed  in  detail,  and  the  roadmap  of  chlorine  during  MSW- 
incineration, was identiﬁed.

From the study, plastics, as the main source of Cl, and kitchen 
waste,  due  to  large  content  of  alkali  chloride  salts,  contribute 
by approximately 20% and 45% to the total Cl-content (TCC), re- 
spectively.  Wood  chips,  paper  and  cupboards,  textiles,  and  other 
wastes contain certain amounts of chlorine, as well. Only analysing 
the  TCC  is  not  enough  to  study  Cl-associated  problems,  as  or- 
ganic  and  inorganic  chlorine  have  different  combustion  behav- 
iors.  For  PVC,  the  ratio  between  organic/inorganic  and  com- 
bustible/incombustible  chlorine  is  similar,  whereas  for  kitchen 
waste, the case is reversed. During the incineration process, Cl is 
initially released as HCl(g) at low temperatures as a result of the 
degradation of organic Cl and subsequently undergoes secondary 
reactions, either with alkali, yielding alkali chloride, or with ba- 
sic functionalities on the char surface. At high temperatures, Cl is 
released as alkali chloride because of the high binding energy of 
inorganic chlorine salts. 

Chlorine enhances the volatilization of the other inorganic ele- 
ments (Na, K, Zn, Pb, and S) due to the formation of highly-volatile 
chlorides, which delays the condensation of metal compounds and 
lowers the dew point temperature, hence increasing the likelihood 
of metals migrating into the ﬂy ash or ﬂue gas during incinera- 
tion. Small quantities of alkali metal are released during the de- 
volatilization stage, mainly as hydroxides, due to the thermal de- 
composition of organic structures, while large amounts of alkali are 
volatilized at higher temperatures during the char burnout stage as 
chlorides, either due to the vaporization of inorganic salts, or, due 
to the decomposition of char-bound alkalis. A large fraction of S is 
released at temperatures (cid:7) 500  °C, while very little additional S is 
released at temperatures > 500  °C. 

The  aerosols  formed  during  incineration  have  a  bimodal  size 
distribution, with the submicron particles originating from the ho- 
mogeneous nucleation of alkali sulfates, and subsequent condensa- 
tion of chlorides. The ﬁne particles contain large amounts of heavy 
metals, alkali metals, Cl, and S. The coarse ash particles originate 
from mineral grains in the waste fractions due to fragmentation by 
thermal stresses. Intermediate particles with chemical properties 
overlapping those of ﬁne and coarse particles are also formed in 
incinerators. The presence of sulfate nuclei suppresses the homo- 
geneous nucleation of chloride by serving as condensation nuclei 
for the condensation of sulfate and chloride vapours in the boiler. 
Additionally, oxides of heavy metals such as ZnO released from the 
grate during incineration, may act as condensation nuclei for the 
secondary particles. 

The corrosion of boiler tube metal is mainly induced by chlo- 
rine  gas  and  alkali  chlorides,  either  in  solid  form  or  by  form- 
ing eutectic mixtures with low-melting temperatures, with heavy 
metal chlorides. Active oxidation is the main mechanism, acceler- 
ating corrosion through gaseous chlorine, while alkali chlorides in 
deposits accelerate corrosion ﬁrst by the reaction of alkalis with 
protective oxide. This ruptures the scale, and the liberated Cl fur- 
ther prolongs the corrosion process. Molten alkali compounds ac- 
celerate the corrosion of metals by forming a ﬂux with the pro- 
tective oxide layer, after which the liquid formed, promotes faster 
chemical reactions than those in the solid phase and allows ionic 
charge  transfers  for  electrochemical  attack.  During  the  incinera- 
tion of waste, the corrosion induced by molten alkali chlorides is 
the most severe and should therefore be avoided ﬁrst, followed by 
the corrosion caused by alkali chlorides in solid deposits and then 
gaseous chlorine attack. Other alkali compounds such as carbon- 
ates have been found to be equally corrosive as alkali chlorides. 
Nevertheless, long-term investigations are needed to substantiate 
this conclusion. 

Co-combustion  and  the  optimization  of  the  combustion  envi- 
ronment  by  the  utilization  of  technology  such  as  Segher  boiler 
prisms and Ecotubes, reduces the boiler ash deposition and cor- 
rosion due to the alkali capture by mineral elements, such as Al 

and  Si  in  coal  or  sewage  during  co-combustion,  while  ensuring 
high turbulence and optimal mixing within the boiler. The dom- 
inant pathway for alkali capture during co-combustion is alumina- 
silication due to the high contents of Al and Si in coal, while sul- 
fation plays a minor role.

Corrosion-resistant alloys lengthen the boiler tube life against 
corrosion.  For  corrosion  induced  by  gaseous  chlorine,  a  high  Cr- 
content  in  the  steel  offers  good  corrosion  resistance  due  to  the 
low  partial pressure of  oxidation  and faster  diffusion, leading to 
the formation of a Cr 
3 -layer near the substrate with fewer dif- 
fusion paths for chlorine. For corrosion induced by KCl in either 
the solid or the molten phase, a higher Cr-content reduces the re- 
sistance ability of the metal alloy because of the high dissolution 
of Cr 
3 in the salts. Ni and Mo are the most resistant elements 
under reducing conditions, whereas oxides of aluminum, titanium 
and silicon are resistant in oxidizing environments; thus, the most 
resistant material system is suggested to consist of a nickel base 
material that forms a dense alumina, silicate, or titanate scale.
