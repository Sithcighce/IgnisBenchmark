Ongoing progress in synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and catalysis continues to produce a diverse 
array of advanced biofuels with complex molecular structure and functional groups. In order to integrate 
biofuels into existing combustion systems, and to optimize the design of next-generation combustion 
systems, understanding connections between molecular structure and ignition at low-temperature con- 
ditions ( < 10 0 0 K) remains a priority that is addressed in part using chemical kinetics modeling. The 
development of predictive models relies on detailed information, derived from experimental and theoret- 
ical studies, on molecular structure and chemical reactivity, both of which inﬂuence the balance of chain 
reactions that occur during combustion – propagation, termination, and branching. In broad context, three 
main categories of reactions affect ignition behavior: (i) initiation reactions that generate a distribution 
of organic radicals,  ˙ R ; (ii) competing unimolecular decomposition of  ˙ R and bimolecular reaction of  ˙ R with 
O 2 ; (iii) decomposition mechanisms of peroxy radical adducts (RO ˙ O ), including isomerization via RO ˙ O (cid:2)
˙ Q OOH. All three categories are inﬂuenced by functional groups in different ways, which causes a shift in 
the balance of chain reactions that unfold over complex temperature- and pressure-dependent mecha- 
nisms. 

The objective of the present review is three-fold: (1) to provide a historical account of research on 
low-temperature oxidation of biofuels, including initiation reactions, peroxy radical reactions,  ˙ Q OOH- 
mediated reaction mechanisms, and chain-branching chemistry; (2) to summarize the inﬂuence of func- 
tional groups on chemical kinetics relevant to chain-branching reactions, which are responsible for the 
accelerated production of radicals that leads to ignition; (3) to identify areas of research that are needed 
– experimentally and computationally – to address fundamental questions that remain. 

Results from experimental, quantum chemical, and chemical kinetics modeling studies are reviewed 
for several classes of biofuels – alcohols, esters, ketones, acyclic ethers and cyclic ethers – and are com- 
pared against analogous results in alkane oxidation. The review is organized into separate sections for 
each biofuel class, which include studies on thermochemistry and bond dissociation energies, rate coeﬃ- 
cients for initiation reactions via H-abstraction and related branching fractions, reaction mechanisms and 
product formation from reactive intermediates, ignition delay times, and chemical kinetics modeling. Each 
section is then summarized in order to identify areas for which additional functional group-speciﬁc work 
is required. The review concludes with an outline for research directions for improving the fundamental 
understanding of biofuel ignition chemistry and related chemical kinetics modeling.

1. Introduction 

Growing  needs  for  sustainable  transportation  energy  provide 
substantial  motivation  for  continued  investment  in  fundamental 
chemical kinetics research [1–7] , including on the combustion of 
hydrogen [8] , methane [9] , and ammonia [10] . Oxygenated hydro- 
carbon  biofuels  also  provide  a  viable  path  to  sustainable  energy 
[11-18]  and  may  contribute  to  increasing  the  eﬃciency  of  com- 
bustion systems even at low blending levels [ 19 , 20 ]. In addition 
to being a lower-carbon-intensive energy source, biofuels offer the 
potential for mitigation of adverse climate impacts [ 12 , 21-34 ]. Be- 
cause of the importance to transportation energy needs, numerous 
organizations focus on combustion chemistry research and related 
impact on engine eﬃciency and pollutant formation, including the 
U.S. DOE Co-Optima program [35–38] , the Fuel Science Center at 
Aachen  University  in  Germany  [ 39 ,  40 ],  and  the  Computational 
Chemistry Consortium (C3) [41] . In parallel are several U.S. Depart- 

ment of Energy research consortia tasked with the development 
and realization of alternative biofuels: the Joint BioEnergy Institute 
(JBEI) [42] , the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center [43] led by 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the BioEnergy Science Center 
[44] at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Center for Advanced 
Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI) led by the Univer- 
sity  of  Illinois  Urbana-Champaign  [ 11 ,  45 ].  In  addition,  the  Fuel 
Science Center at Aachen University [ 39 , 40 , 46 ] combines biofuel 
combustion research with synthetic biology research on the pro- 
duction of alternative biofuels. One continuing challenge of such 
organizations is to understand, among other topics, the interplay 
between fundamental combustion chemistry of new biofuels and 
ongoing design of advanced engine strategies. 

Advanced compression-ignition (ACI) [47] is a category of tech- 
nologies  that  are  considered  in  the  design  of  next-generation 
combustion  engine  strategies  focused  on  high-eﬃciency,  low- 
emissions  operation.  Some  examples  of  ACI  include  kinetically

controlled  strategies  such  as  homogeneous  charge  compression- 
ignition [48–50] (HCCI), dual-fuel strategies such as reactivity con- 
trolled compression-ignition (RCCI) [51] , and hybrid concepts such 
as multi-mode engines [ 52 , 53 ]. All of approaches using ACI rely 
extensively on fundamental knowledge of oxidation chemistry at 
low  temperatures  ( <  10 0 0  K)  [54–57] .  As  a  result,  the  devel- 
opment of new technologies for sustainable transportation relies 
ﬁrmly on an understanding of reactions that govern ignition timing 
and  heat-release  rates,  which  depend  on  chain-branching  chem- 
istry. The degree to which such understanding is useful, however, 
depends on the ability to simulate combustion over practical con- 
ditions using chemical kinetics mechanisms. The eﬃcacy of such 
mechanisms hinges on validation against measurements of rate co- 
eﬃcients, species proﬁles, and ignition delay times, and quantum 
chemical modeling of rate coeﬃcients, branching fractions, and re- 
action mechanisms, all of which are strongly inﬂuenced by molec- 
ular structure. 

Functional  groups  of  biofuels,  including  alcohol  (R–OH),  es- 
ter (R–(C = O)–O–R), ketone (R–(C = O)–R), and ether (R–O–R), add 
complexity  to  reaching  an  understanding  of  chain-branching  ki- 
netics.  Just  as  with  features  in  hydrocarbon  molecular  structure, 
including  C = C  bonds  [58–62]  and  branching  [ 63 ,  64 ],  functional 
groups of biofuels often lead to  profound effects on combustion 
chemistry. For example, compared with hydrocarbon analogs, func- 
tional  groups  can  lengthen  or  shorten  ignition  delay  times  ow- 
ing to a combination of effects at each step involved in autoigni- 
tion (branching of initial radical, changes in peroxy radical reaction 
mechanisms,  etc.).  As  the  development  of  advanced  combustion 
strategies continues, fundamental understanding of biofuel chem- 
ical  kinetics  becomes  increasingly  important,  particularly  under 
low-temperature conditions, where ignition is governed by molec- 
ular structure due to the dependence on peroxy radical chemistry. 
Ignition behavior is dictated by distinct chain-branching reac- 
tions, the nature of which depends on temperature. Three distinc- 
tive regimes of temperature are observed in combustion chemistry: 
high-temperature ( > 1100 K), intermediate temperature ( ∼800 –
1100 K), and low-temperature ( < 800 K). In the high-temperature 
region, the main chain-branching reactions are  ˙ H + O 
2  (cid:2) ˙ O H + Ö
[65–68] and Ö + H 
2 (cid:2) ˙ O H + ˙ H [ 69 , 70 ] while at intermediate tem- 
2 → ˙ O H + ˙ O H [71–74] is the governing reaction. Hy- 
peratures H 
drogen  peroxide  is  formed  largely  from  H-abstraction  reactions 
from RH by HO ˙ O [75–80] and by HO ˙ O self-reaction [81–85] . HO ˙ O 
2 → HO ˙ O + alkene  and 
is  populated  from  reactions  such  as  ˙ R + O 
˙ Q OOH → HO ˙ O + alkene and dissociates into  ˙ H + O 
2 at high temper- 
ature while remaining relatively unreactive at lower temperatures. 
2 is thermally stable and ceases

With decreasing temperature, H 
chain-branching. Instead, a shift in the balance of reactions occurs 
to where chain-branching is dependent on reactions of oxygenated 
hydrocarbon (alkylperoxy) radicals, as explained in the section be- 
low. Chain-branching chemistry is species-speciﬁc and effective at 
lower temperatures. For some species, a gap may form between 
the temperature above which alkylperoxy chemistry can no longer 
sustain  the  chain  reaction  and  the  higher  temperature  at  which 
2 → ˙ O H + ˙ O H can take over. That gap is the negative temper- 
H 
ature  coeﬃcient  (NTC)  region,  within  which  reactivity  decreases 
with increasing temperature. In the NTC region a plot of ignition 
delay against temperature takes on an S-shaped curve, the magni- 
tude and location of which depend on the formation and fate of 
peroxy radicals that drive low-temperature combustion, which are 
strongly inﬂuenced by pressure and by molecular structure.

1.1. Low-temperature combustion chemistry 

Hydrocarbon and biofuel oxidation follows a degenerate chain- 
branching  mechanism  [86–89]  ( Figure  1 ),  which  is  governed 
by  the  formation  and  reaction  of  carbon-centered  hydroperoxy- 

3 

substituted radicals,  ˙ Q OOH [90] . The sequence is initiated by the 
production of an organic radical  ˙ R formed via H-abstraction from 
a  parent  molecule  (RH)  by  ˙ O H  or  other  radicals,  including  HO ˙ O 
3 .  Subsequent  formation of  organic peroxy  radicals,  RO ˙ O , 
and  ˙CH 
from  the  addition  reaction  ˙ R + O 
2  (cid:2) RO ˙ O ,  gives  rise  to  two  re- 
action pathways in the forward direction: isomerization, RO ˙ O (cid:2)
˙ Q OOH,  and  concerted  decomposition  to  a  conjugate  alkene  and 
hydroperoxyl, RO ˙ O −→ alkene + HO ˙ O . Reactions of the latter type 
are  chain-inhibiting  since  hydroperoxyl  radicals  primarily  form 
2 ),  via  RH + HO ˙ O  −→  ˙ R + H 
2 O 
hydrogen  peroxide  (H 
2  and  via 
HO ˙ O + HO ˙ O −→ O 
2 , which is stable up to ∼10 0 0 K. Uni- 
2 + H 
2 O 
molecular  reactions  of  ˙ Q OOH  can  also  produce  HO ˙ O  or  undergo 
chain-propagation reactions, yielding one  ˙ O H radical, which lead 
either to the formation of cyclic ether species or to other products 
such as carbonyls and alkenes via β-scission reactions.

The isomerization reaction RO ˙ O (cid:2) ˙ Q OOH is required for chain- 
branching,  the  multiplication  of  radicals  that  accelerates  overall 
oxidation rates of RH. In competition with chain-propagation and 
chain-inhibiting reactions, because  ˙ Q OOH are carbon-centered rad- 
icals,  bimolecular  reaction  with  O 
2 -addition) 
2  (termed  second  O 
can  occur:  ˙ Q OOH + O 
2  (cid:2) ˙ O OQOOH.  The  hydroperoxyalkylperoxy 
radical,  ˙ O OQOOH,  can  again  isomerize  by  an  internal  hydrogen 
shift to form a carbon-centered radical with two –OOH groups, de- 
noted HOO ˙ P OOH. Such isomerization often tends to favor transfer 
of a hydrogen on the same carbon that holds the ﬁrst –OOH, be- 
cause the C–H bond is weakened by the hydroperoxyl group. That 
transfer gives a HOO ˙ P OOH that is an unstable α-hydroperoxy rad- 
ical  and  that  rapidly  sheds  an  ˙ O H  radical  to  give  a  closed-shell 
molecule  with  a  carbonyl  functional  group  and  a  hydroperoxyl 
group – a ketohydroperoxide (KHP). As the linchpin for autoigni- 
tion, ketohydroperoxides dissociate at moderate temperatures into 
a second  ˙ O H and another oxy radical, therein providing the neces- 
sary chain-branching step. 

2 -addition,  ˙ R + O 

The paradigm for alkane oxidation in Figure 1 is dependent on 
molecular structure, e.g. such as the presence of C = C bonds [ 60 , 
90 ] or oxygenated functional groups [91] . One key objective of fun- 
damental ignition chemistry research is to understand what diverts 
progress from the path to chain-branching causing differences in 
chain-branching and ignition chemistry due to molecular structure. 
For example, dissociation of a ketohydroperoxide into two stable 
species, as occurs in Korcek decomposition [92–95] , prevents chain 
branching and makes  ˙ O H + KHP a chain-propagating channel (be- 
cause only one  ˙ O H radical is formed from the initial  ˙ R ). Each step 
in the degenerate chain-branching mechanism in Figure 1 (radical 
2  (cid:2) RO ˙ O , RO ˙ O isomerization,  ˙ Q OOH 
initiation, O 
reactions, etc.) is affected by functional groups in fundamentally 
different ways that depend on molecular structure. Speciﬁc types 
of  interactions  are  depicted  in  Figure  1 b  for  each  step  in  the 
mechanism.  For  example,  the  selectivity  of  initial  radical  forma- 
tion by hydrogen abstraction from the parent molecule is affected 
by  changes  in  C-H  bond  energy  near  the  oxygenated  group  and 
(as made clear in the subsequent sections) the presence of hydro- 
gen bonding in the entrance channel and transition state of the 
abstraction. The availability of hydrogen bonding is an important 
consequence  of  oxygenation  whose  effects  are  most  pronounced 
at lower temperature, but which can inﬂuence branching fractions 
well into the low-temperature ignition regime. The reaction of the 
2  produces an RO ˙ O radical, whose 
initially formed radical with O 
stabilization and isomerization is changed by the differences in rel- 
ative stability created by the effects of the oxygenated functional 
group (e.g., through vinoxylic resonance stabilization), and so on 
for each step in the chain. An example of the layers of fundamental 
chemical research necessary to identify and characterize functional 
group inﬂuence on low-temperature autoignition is schematically 
illustrated in Figure 2 .

Fig. 1.  (a) Conventional chain-branching mechanism for alkane oxidation. Reactions along the main path proceed towards chain branching. The side reactions either form 
reactive radicals, such as  ˙ O H, and are chain-propagating (depicted as curved arrows returning towards the start of the sequence) or produce less reactive species such as 
HO ˙ O and are chain-inhibiting at low temperature (depicted as downward-directed arrows). For example, reactions of  ˙ Q OOH proceed either via unimolecular  ˙ O H elimination 
to form cyclic ethers, shown as the curved arrow, or bimolecular reaction with O 2 leading to the adduct  ˙ O OQOOH. The balance of the two pathways governs reactivity 
characteristics of hydrocarbons and biofuels. (b) Oxygenated functional groups can impact each step in the sequence; examples of functional group effects are listed at each 
point. 

Ignition delay times are global observables that are important 
for  understanding  the  potential  impact  of  a  biofuel  on  combus- 
tion systems and provide critical validation targets for chemical ki- 
netics mechanism development and combustion modeling. Lead- 
ing  up  to  the  observed  ignition  event  are  the  chemical  mecha- 
nisms delineated in Figures 1 and 2 . As fundamental targets for 
mechanism development, and in support of enabling predictive ca- 
pabilities  for  modeling  ignition,  quantitative  speciation  measure- 
ments,  particularly  of  ˙ Q OOH-mediated  products,  are  central  for 
validating  branching  fractions  of  initial  radicals  and  for  ˙ R + O 
2 
rates determined via experimental measurements or via quantum 
chemical and theoretical kinetics calculations. Assuming that the 
balance  of  reactions  producing  and  consuming  ˙ Q OOH  are  well- 
prescribed  (both  chemical  kinetics  and  thermochemistry),  chain- 
branching chemistry becomes predictable and mechanisms become 
reliable in simulations of ignition delay times with high ﬁdelity. 

The  chemistry  of  low-temperature  autoignition  is  the  subject 
of  extensive  reviews.  Battin-Leclerc  [99]  described  the  develop- 
ment and use of detailed chemical mechanisms in predicting low- 
temperature hydrocarbon combustion, Tran et al. [91] speciﬁcally 
reviewed  mechanisms  for  biofuels,  and  Sarathy  et  al.  [100]  re- 
viewed alcohol combustion. Zádor et al. [54] reviewed the elemen- 
tary reaction kinetics that such mechanisms incorporate. Recently, 
Wang et al. [101] highlighted the role of hydroperoxides, includ- 
ing the key ketohydroperoxide species, in low-temperature com- 
bustion chemistry. The distinctive chemistry of biofuel combustion 
was highlighted by Kohse-Höinghaus [102] , with emphasis on the 
insights given by ﬂame chemistry measurements. The present re- 
view  focuses  on  elementary  reaction  kinetics  and  describes  the 
current understanding of the role of oxygenated functional groups 
in biofuels on alterations to reaction pathways that occur in the 
low-temperature combustion of hydrocarbons.

delay time measurements of n -butane (20 atm) from Healy et al. [96] compared with 1-butanol (15 atm) from Weber et al. [97] and Heufer et al. [98] . Ignition delay times 
of n -butane exhibit NTC behavior from ∼775 – 900 K. The alcohol functional group alters the balance of reactions involving RO ˙ O and  ˙ Q OOH, which is the cause for longer 
ignition delay times below 900 K. 

1.2. Molecular structures of biofuels 

Progress in synthetic biology [103–109] , catalysis [110–116] , and 
metabolic engineering [117–122] is diversifying the types of bio- 
fuels suitable for transportation applications, which at present is 
largely comprised of ethanol and biodiesel. Table 1 lists structures 
and molecular formulae of current and proposed next-generation 
biofuels  and  references  for  corresponding  synthesis  techniques. 
The biofuels listed in Table 1 are in various stages of practical util- 
ity, from laboratory scale results to scaled-up production, similar to 
2,6,10-trimethyldodecane (farnesane) [123] . It is also emphasized 
that a particular biofuel need not be a complete replacement for 
diesel or gasoline, as even small amounts can enable operation at 
signiﬁcantly improved engine eﬃciency [19] . Methanol is not listed 
in Table 1 , yet is a potential biofuel additive [124] or can be used 
to produce other biofuels [125–128] . 

Some hydrocarbon biofuel molecules may be structurally com- 
plex  compared  with  hydrocarbons  that  constitute  gasoline  [ 129 , 
130 ]  or  diesel  [131–133] ,  e.g.,  with  cyclic  moieties  bonded  to 
branched  side-chains  (bisabolane,  limonane).  However,  the  low- 
temperature  chemistry  of  such  fuels  is  largely  captured  by  the 
framework  developed  for  traditional  distillate  hydrocarbons.  The 
subject of the present review is the chemistry of the large set of 
emerging oxygenated biofuels, types of which include ethers, fu- 
rans  and  furan  derivatives,  ketones,  and  hybrid  species.  In  addi- 
tion to altering physical properties, the different molecular bonding 
structure brought about by oxygenation affects fundamental chem- 
ical  properties  that  govern  low-temperature  autoignition  chem- 
istry. 

2. Methods of studying low-temperature combustion chemistry 

Autoignition reﬂects a balance of competing chemical reaction 
pathways and chain-reactions that consume the parent molecule 
and contribute to heat release rates and subsequent pressure rise 
in engines that in turn affect the time at which ignition occurs. 
In-cylinder  ﬂuid  dynamics,  including  injection,  droplet  breakup, 
evaporation,  and  charge-compression,  inherently  create  tempera- 
ture  and  concentration  gradients  in  the  reactive  mixture,  which 
alters the balance of chemical reactions. Because molecular struc- 
ture  governs  the  sensitivity  of  oxidation  reactions  to  both  tem- 

perature and pressure, an important target remains the develop- 
ment of well-constrained computational models to predict the ef- 
fects of both on autoignition in order to aid in the design of next- 
generation engine strategies. The trajectory of fundamental under- 
standing  of  autoignition,  from  chemical  reactions  to  mechanism 
development, involves multi-faceted experimental, computational, 
and theoretical research efforts that target the inﬂuence of molec- 
ular structure. Because functional groups are differentiating molec- 
ular features of oxygenated biofuels from conventional hydrocar- 
bons, autoignition studies routinely center on the inﬂuence of bio- 
fuel structure on fundamental chemical pathways and the global 
ignition behavior. 

A  full-spectrum  approach  to  studying  low-temperature  bio- 
fuel  autoignition  requires  a  broad  range  of  measurements,  ob- 
tained from numerous experimental techniques, coupled with in- 
sight  from  computational  and  theoretical  chemistry  to  describe 
functional-group  effects  on  autoignition.  The  following  sections 
outline the principal experimental, computational, and theoretical 
approaches currently utilized to study autoignition chemistry. The 
experimental apparatus are separated in terms of focus: transient 
speciation, steady-state speciation, and ignition delay times from 
shock tube and rapid compression machines. Computational and 
theoretical approaches are separated according to scope, from ab 
initio  calculations  of  rate  coeﬃcients  to  detailed  chemical  kinet- 
ics modeling. In general, experimental results on autoignition ki- 
netics are intended to serve as modeling targets. However, mod- 
eling efforts also contribute to deﬁning new experimental targets. 
The broader objective of the combined experimental and compu- 
tational efforts is a fundamental description of biofuel autoignition 
chemistry that is useful for modeling combustion phenomena in 
complex reactive ﬂows. 

2.1. Time-dependent speciation experiments 

Rate coeﬃcient measurements of fundamental reactions are vi- 
tal for modeling autoignition chemistry. To deﬁne and verify the 
chemical understanding of low-temperature combustion, it is most 
important to obtain direct measurements of species in the RO ˙ O de- 
composition  mechanism  in  Figure  1  [295–299] ,  fundamental  hy- 
drocarbon  chemistry  [300] ,  and  unique  decomposition  pathways 
not included in the paradigm of Figure 1 [ 301 , 302 ]. Measurements

that use photolysis to initiate controlled oxidation can be coupled 
with  spectroscopic  probes  that  target  key  intermediates  like  the 
hydroxyl radical [303] . The multi-pass near-infrared (NIR) absorp- 
tion approach of Taatjes [304] produced rate coeﬃcient measure- 
ments of  ˙ R + O 
2  (cid:2) ˙OOQOOH 
2  reactions [305-308] and  ˙ Q OOH + O 
[297] ,  where  ˙ Q OOH  was  derived  from  tert -butylhydroperoxide. 
The NIR experiments also provide measurements for constraining 
chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  by  measuring  ˙ O H  and  HO ˙ O  time 
histories below 800 K [ 304 , 307 , 309 ]. The multiplexed photoion- 
ization  mass  spectrometry  (MPIMS)  approach  [ 90 ,  310–312 ]  ex- 
tends  such  measurements  to  allow  simultaneous  detection  and 
characterization of a wide range of products and intermediates, in- 
creasing the detail of information that can be obtained on funda- 
mental reaction mechanisms important to low-temperature com- 
bustion chemistry. The quiescent reﬂected-shock region and opti- 
cal access afforded by shock tubes permits the application of laser- 
based diagnostics to measurements of rate coeﬃcients [313] using 
highly diluted systems (i.e. RH ∼ 0.1% vol. [314] ), and the multi- 
species time history measurements of Hanson and Davidson et al. 
(e.g. [315–319] ) provide critical information for reﬁning chemical 
kinetics mechanisms. More extensive speciation measurements in 
single-pulse shock tubes [320] were obtained using GC by Lifshitz 
[ 321 , 322 ] and Brezinsky et al. [323–325] , the conventional shock 
tube approach by Ferris et al. [ 326 , 327 ], and by VUV photoion- 
ization by Tranter and Lynch [ 328 , 329 ]. Speciation from RCM also 
yields kinetics insight at engine-relevant conditions [ 330 , 331 ]. 

2.2. Steady state speciation experiments 

Flow  reactors  provide  a  means  of  quantifying  species  formed 
as  intermediates  from  oxidation  and  enable  speciation  measure- 
ments related to autoignition from ∼500 < T (K) < 1200, mostly 
over the pressure range 1 – 10 atm. Speciation of stable interme- 
diates in ﬂow reactor experiments is typically performed by direct 
sampling using a tandem of gas chromatography/mass spectrome- 
try (GC/MS), ﬂame ionization detection (FID), and thermal conduc- 
tivity detection (TCD). Flow reactor designs most commonly uti- 
lized to investigate low-temperature chemistry include plug-ﬂow 
reactors  [332–337] ,  micro  reactors  [338–340] ,  and  jet-stirred  re- 
actors  (JSR)  [341–343] ,  all  of  which  provide  homogeneous  mix- 
ing of reactants under controlled conditions of temperature, pres- 
sure, and residence time. Jet-stirred reactors coupled with molec- 
ular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) yield new insight into low- 
temperature chemistry [344] . The reviews by Dryer et al. [345] on 
plug-ﬂow reactors, and by Herbinet and Battin-Leclerc [346] and 
Dayma  and  Herbinet  [347]  on  jet-stirred  reactors,  provide  thor- 
ough  insight  into  the  underlying  physics  and  related  measure- 
ments. Mole fractions measured are obtained over a range of tem- 
perature, pressure, and equivalence ratio, and dilute conditions are 
employed  to  minimize  heat  release  in  the  reactor  and  to  mini- 
mize  the  rates  of  bimolecular  reactions  during  the  gas-sampling 
process.

2.3. Ignition delay times 

Two  apparatus  are  most  commonly  used  to  measure  ignition 
delay  time  trends:  shock  tubes  and  rapid-compression  machines 
(RCM).  Both  experiments  operate  using  well-characterized  initial 
conditions and are near-ideal reactors with minimal or no inﬂu- 
ence from gas dynamics. For conditions where non-idealities ex- 
ist, facility-speciﬁc effects are accounted for in the interpretation 
of the ignition delay time measurements. Necessary conditions for 
shock tube measurements being void of interference from gas dy- 
namic  effects  are  outlined  in  Petersen  and  Hanson  [ 348 ,  349 ], 
Davidson and Hanson [314] , and in Chaos and Dryer [350] , and the 
conditions for rapid-compression machines are discussed in detail 
in Goldsborough et al. [331] , Griﬃths [ 351 , 352 ], Sung and Curran 
[330] , Kéromnès [353] , and Ihme [354] . 

Shock  tubes  provide  a  method  of  measuring  ignition  delay 
times under both dilute ( > 98% inert gas) and non-dilute conditions 
[355] , differing from RCM experiments in the mechanism of gas 
compression.  In  shock-tube  ignition  experiments,  reﬂected  shock 
waves generate temperatures and pressures relevant to autoigni- 
tion  on  μs-timescales  [ 356 ,  357 ].  Ignition  delay  times  are  mea- 
sured in shock tubes from chemical reactions occurring in the qui- 
escent reﬂected-shock region, using either pressure histories [358] , 
laser  absorption  [359] ,  or  emission-based  deﬁnitions  [ 360 ,  361 ], 
where the latter measurements involve broadband emission, such 
as OH ∗ (X 2 (cid:4) ← A 2 (cid:5)+ ) or CH ∗ (X 2 (cid:4) ← A 2 (cid:6)) chemiluminescence. 
The  main  point  of  contrast  with  RCM  experiments  is  the  avail- 
able  timeframe  within  which  measurements  are  conducted  and 
the  need  to  include  a  model  for  facility-speciﬁc  heat-loss  rates. 
Shock-heated gas temperatures overlap the middle of the temper- 
ature  range  in  RCM  experiments  ( ∼800  K)  and  extend  to  1500 
K  or  higher.  Low-temperature  capabilities  in  conventional  shock 
tubes are limited by expansion/compression wave interactions that 
cause a change in the near-isothermal/isobaric conditions within 
the reﬂected-shock region and ultimately deﬁne the test time (typ- 
ically 2 – 3 ms). Test times are extendable by delaying the arrival 
of the expansion wave at the test section using driver-gas tailoring, 
a method which effectively reduces the acoustic speed of the ex- 
pansion waves, as discussed by Petersen et al. [362] , or by the use 
of driver-section inserts as designed by Hanson et al. [363] . Com- 
bined  with  driver-gas  tailoring,  advances  in  experimental  design 
by  Hanson  et  al.,  including  the  aerosol  shock  tube  [364] ,  which 
allows  for  gas-phase  experiments  on  low-vapor-pressure  hydro- 
carbons and biofuels, and the constrained-reaction-volume (CRV) 
shock  tube  [365] ,  which  provides  more-ideal  shock  tube  condi- 
tions, permits low-temperature ignition measurements of relevant 
biofuels,  including  1-butanol  [366]  and  methyl  esters  related  to 
biodiesel [367] . The ideal conditions of the CRV approach avoids 
errors associated with modeling reﬂected-shock gas dynamics us- 
ing either constant internal energy ( U ) and volume ( V ), or constant 
pressure ( P ) and enthalpy ( H ) [314] . 

Rapid-compression machines use controlled, piston - driven gas- 
compression  to  measure  ignition  delay  time  trends  under  prac- 
tical  conditions  of  temperature,  pressure,  and  fuel  concentration 
[ 98 , 330 , 331 , 351 , 368 , 369 ]. The RCM apparatus is designed to 
closely replicate a single compression stroke in an engine, yet un- 
der near-adiabatic conditions. Pressure is measured over the course 
of the compression stroke, and peak pressure is recorded as the 
compressed-gas pressure ( P c ) and deﬁnes time-zero for monitoring 
ignition  delay  times.  Using  pressure  time-histories  and  adiabatic 
approximations, a compressed-gas temperature is then calculated 
which serves as the initial temperature of the reaction. Typical op- 
erating ranges are ∼50 0 < T (K) < 110 0 and 10 < P c (atm) < 100. 
Modeling and analysis of pressure time-histories is also employed 
in RCM experiments to closely reproduce the temporal variation in 
temperature and accurately determine gas-dynamic-induced tem-

perature changes as a function of time, including for multi-stage 
ignition  [370] .  The  primary  advantage  of  RCM  measurements  is 
operation  over  the  entire  negative-temperature-coeﬃcient  (NTC) 
region of hydrocarbon autoignition at engine-relevant conditions: 
2  ∼76% 
high-pressure,  low-temperature,  non - dilute  conditions  (N 
vol.). Commonly, ignition is deﬁned using measurements of pres- 
sure, where a sharp increase occurs relative to P c , indicating pri- 
mary ignition. Two-stage ignition, similar to the phenomenon in 
engine measurements, is also detectable. Other diagnostics applied 
to  RCM  experiments  include  speciation  and  chemiluminescence 
imaging [ 371 , 372 ]. 

2.4. Detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms 

Chemical kinetics mechanisms focusing on low-temperature au- 
toignition  chemistry  of  biofuels  are  ubiquitous  in  the  literature 
[ 99 ,  373–389 ],  and  continue  to  increase  in  size  (i.e.  number  of 
species  and  reactions)  to  accommodate  interest  in  engine  appli- 
cations  [ 390 ,  391 ].  Pioneering  effort s  of  Dixon - Lewis  [ 392 ,  393 ], 
Miller et al. [394] , Kee et al. [ 395 , 396 ], Warnatz [397] , Troe [398] , 
Westbrook  and  Dryer  [ 375 ,  399 ],  and  countless  others  over  the 
past several decades led to the development of eﬃcient compu- 
tational  methods  that  enable  detailed  analysis  of  complex  com- 
bustion  reactions  using  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms.  Owing  to 
computational advances in matrix preconditioning [391] , the use of 
larger chemical kinetics mechanisms is becoming more feasible in 
combustion simulations of practical systems, which is particularly 
important  for  low-temperature  autoignition,  where  RO ˙ O  adducts 
can decompose along numerous pathways involving thousands of 
species and reactions. Detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms and 
related derivatives (e.g. semi-empirical, skeletal) offer some insight 
into experimental ignition delay times, species proﬁles, and can in- 
dicate which of the underlying pathways are more favored. Over 
the past decade, automated methods for developing reaction net- 
works,  such  as  Reaction  Mechanism  Generator  (RMG)  [400]  and 
Genesys [ 401 , 402 ], are increasingly applied to producing detailed 
kinetic mechanisms for low-temperature combustion. Reviews by 
Dagaut [373] , Westbrook and Dryer [375] , Ranzi et al. [403] , Pitz 
[132] , Battin-Leclerc et al. [404] , Wang et al. [ 405 , 406 ], and Cur- 
ran [88] provide extensive details on chemical kinetics mechanism 
development. 

2.5. Theoretical chemical kinetics 

The  rate  coeﬃcients  that  are  required  for  detailed  chemical 
mechanisms are far too extensive in number and in pressure and 
temperature range for explicit experimental characterization ever 
to  become  complete.  Rate  expressions  are  therefore  commonly 
generated via rate rules and structure-activity relationships [407–
411]  that couple experimental  data  with  theory.  As  theory  be- 
comes  more  powerful  and  accurate  calculations  of  reaction  rate 
parameters become extendable to larger molecular systems, quan- 
tum  chemistry  and  direct  kinetics  calculations  [ 54 ,  412–415 ]  are 
increasingly displacing methods of experimental interpolation and 
analogy commonly used to develop such rate rules. Klippenstein 
[416] recently highlighted the state of the art in predictive theoret- 
ical kinetics, emphasizing the need to combine advanced theory in 
electronic structure calculations, reaction rate theory, energy trans- 
fer, and master equation kinetics methods. Accuracy in all of these 
areas is critical to a theoretical description of the pressure depen- 
dent  reactions  governing  autoignition.  Such  reactions  often  take 
place on highly complex potential energy surfaces with multiple 
wells and many possible reaction channels. Miller et al. [417] pro- 
vide an extensive review of theoretical chemical kinetics contribu- 
tions and challenges in the context of combustion modeling. Simi- 
lar to the implementation of automated methods for chemical net-

work  generation,  new  techniques  are  being  introduced  for  auto- 
matically  searching  complex  surfaces  and  characterizing  the  sta- 
tionary points that determine the reaction kinetics [ 416 , 418–422 ]. 
Such methods dramatically increase the throughput for calculation 
of reaction kinetics, and can locate transition states that manual 
methods miss, as demonstrated for ketohydroperoxide decompo- 
sition [423] , one of the most crucial low-temperature combustion 
reactions. 

The  present  review  provides  a  comprehensive  comparison  of 
rate  coeﬃcients  for  different  types  of  reactions  (initiation,  addi- 
tion, and isomerization), which are often calculated using differ- 
ent electronic structure methods and different kinetics modeling 
approaches. Zádor et al. [54] summarized the ideal strategy lead- 
ing to accurate rate coeﬃcient calculations ( Figure 3 ): balance the 
level  of  electron  correlation  and  basis  set  to  increase  the  accu- 
racy of the electronic structure calculations; balance the levels of 
the microcanonical rate coeﬃcient model and the collision model 
to increase the accuracy of theoretical kinetics. Density functional 
methods lack the clear systematic path of improvement that is de- 
picted in Figure 3 for wave-function based electronic structure cal- 
culations, although a hierarchy of functional types is proposed by 
Perdew et al. [424] . Detailed assessments of functionals (e.g., [ 425 , 
426 ]) can provide guidance on expected accuracy and appropriate 
areas of applicability within the density functional ‘zoo’ [427] . 

Fig. 4.  Structure of 1-pentanol with H-abstraction sites labeled. The inﬂuence of the 
–OH group extends from α to δ sites and affects the distribution of initial radicals 
formed via abstraction by  ˙ O H, HO ˙ O , or other radicals. The formation of α radicals 
via H-abstraction is dominant at temperatures relevant to RO ˙ O chemistry. 

3 ˙ O , CH 

3 O ˙ O , and others, because the review con- 
tion, including CH 
centrates on major initiation (abstraction) reactions, only the most 
important  radicals  below  10 0 0  K  are  considered:  ˙ O H,  HO ˙ O ,  and 
˙CH 
3 . Other radicals that are more important at high temperature 
( ˙ H , Ö,  ˙ C H 

2 , etc.) are not considered. 

The  molecular  structure  characteristics  and  related  oxidation 
chemistry  of  functional  groups  that  represent  the  majority  of 
oxygenated  biofuels  are  described:  alcohols  ( Section  3.1 ),  esters 
( Section 3.2 ), ketones ( Section 3.3 ), acyclic ethers ( Section 3.4 ), and 
cyclic ethers ( Section 3.5 ). Each section is concluded with a sum- 
mary of the literature and an augmented oxidation scheme that 
shows  radical-speciﬁc  reaction  pathways  impacted  by  the  func- 
tional  group.  When  feasible,  the  chemical  kinetics  are  described 
relative to the non-functionalized hydrocarbon analog of the bio- 
fuel (e.g., for alcohols, –OH functionality is contextualized using 1- 
butanol in reference to n -butane). 

3. Functional group-speciﬁc oxidation chemistry 

3.1. Alcohols 

The  sections  below  describe  the  effects  on  low-temperature 
chain-branching mechanisms of several functional groups common 
to biofuels, drawing on inference from both experimental and com- 
putational studies in the literature. The discussion treats, in turn, 
the chemistry of alcohols, esters, ketones, and acyclic ethers, with 
an  additional  section  describing  the  chemistry  of  cyclic  ethers, 
which are also intermediate products of low-temperature alkane 
oxidation  [428–430] .  Emphasis  is  placed  on  the  effects  of  func- 
tional groups on (i) initiation reactions leading to the formation 
of carbon-centered radicals,  ˙ R , (ii) reactions of  ˙ R with O 
2 , (iii) sub- 
sequent  reaction  pathways  and  product  formation  from  RO ˙ O  re- 
actions, (iv)  ˙ Q OOH reactions, (v) speciation measurements, (vi) ig- 
nition delay times, and (vii) chemical kinetics modeling. While a 
large number of radicals are relevant to low-temperature combus- 

Alcohol  biofuels  include  species  where  the  hydroxy  group  (–
OH) is bound to a primary carbon (e.g. ethanol, 1-pentanol, iso - 
pentanol) or to a secondary carbon (e.g. 2-butanol, cyclohexanol). 
The  bond  energy  of  hydroxylic  hydrogen  is  ∼105  kcal/mol  [ 431 , 
432 ], which is higher by ∼5 kcal/mol and ∼7 kcal/mol compared 
to primary and secondary C–H bonds in alkanes, respectively. As a 
result, abstraction of hydrogen from the –OH group is disfavored 
at temperatures below ∼10 0 0 K [ 76 , 433–436 ]. Initiation reactions 
involving  ˙ O H or HO ˙ O are inﬂuenced by the presence of the –OH 
group, however, in part because of an alteration of C–H bond dis- 
sociation energies on α, β, and γ carbon sites (depicted in Figure 4 
for 1-pentanol) and because of hydrogen-bonding interactions that 
create pre-reaction complexes. Relative to analogous C–H bonds in 
n -alkanes, ab initio calculations conducted on linear alcohols indi-

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 86 (2021) 100925 

cate a reduction in bond dissociation energy of 5-6 kcal/mol on 
the carbon α to the functional group, an increase of 1-2 kcal/mol 
on β carbon, and ∼1 kcal/mol reduction on γ carbon [ 431 , 432 , 
437–439 ]. C–H bond dissociation energies beyond the γ position 
are relatively uninﬂuenced by the –OH group yet, despite the sep- 
aration distance, hydrogen bonding with the abstracting radical is 
important [440] . Heufer et al. [437] ascribe the slight increase in 
C–H bond energy at the β site in linear alcohols, as opposed to 
a  decrease  similar  to  the  adjacent  C–H  bonds,  to  steric  interac- 
tions between the –OH group and the sp 2 -hybridized radical site. 
For alcohols larger than ethanol, lower C–H bond energies coupled 
with electrostatic interaction with the –OH functional group skews 
branching fractions of initiation reactions (via H-abstraction by  ˙ O H 
and HO ˙ O ) in favor of α, β, and γ radicals. Bond dissociation en- 
ergy trends differ somewhat for branched alcohols [441] , however 
α radicals remain favored. 

3.1.1. Initiation reactions and branching fractions 

The distribution of initial radicals that react with O 

2  at tem- 
peratures below 10 0 0 K inﬂuences the balance of chain reaction 
pathways, which makes branching fractions critical to modeling al- 
cohol oxidation mechanisms. Measurements of site-speciﬁc and to- 
tal rate coeﬃcients for H-abstraction at combustion-relevant tem- 
peratures are reported for several alcohols, including reactions of 
˙ O H with ethanol [ 316 , 436 , 4 42–4 46 ] and with isomers of butanol 
[ 433 , 434 , 440 , 447–451 ], which provide some constraint to theo- 
retical predictions of branching fractions. Rate coeﬃcients for hy- 
drogen abstraction by HO ˙ O are also reported for alcohols [ 76 , 435 , 
439 , 452–454 ] and are shown to impact ignition delay time pre- 
dictions [454] . Unlike reactions with  ˙ O H, are all endothermic [453] . 
Abstraction reactions involving  ˙CH 
3 [455–458] are also reported in 
the literature and in some cases compare favorably with experi- 
ments [ 316 , 443 , 446 ]. 

The presence of hydrogen-bonding in the transition state, be- 
tween the abstracting radical and the –OH functional group, leads 
to differences in rate coeﬃcients and branching fractions of the ini- 
tiation step, e.g. X + ROH → XH + ˙ R OH. Selected results for abstrac- 
tion by  ˙ O H, HO ˙ O , and  ˙CH 
3 in the high-pressure limit are discussed 
below for ethanol, 1-butanol, and branched alcohols. In all cases, 
abstraction from α carbon remains the most favored site, and for 
abstraction by HO ˙ O is the exclusive site [ 76 , 459–462 ]. 

3.1.1.1. Linear  alcohols  + 
˙OH.  Despite  several  studies  on  H- 
abstraction by  ˙ O H from linear alcohols, discrepancies remain [ 443 , 
460 , 463 , 464 ]. Glarborg et al. [464] noted, that despite the con- 
sistency  among  the  literature  [ 316 ,  436 ,  443 ,  445 ,  446 ]  on  the 
total  rate  coeﬃcient  for  ˙ O H + ethanol → ˙ R + H 
2 O,  branching  frac- 
tion predictions are in substantial disagreement. Figures 5 a com- 
pares ab initio calculations in the high-pressure limit from Sivara- 
makrishnan et al. [436] , Xu and Lin [445] , and Zheng and Truhlar 
[446] , all of which are consistent with the experimental results of 
Carr et al. [443] , Stranic et al. [316] , Sivaramakrishnan et al. [436] , 
and others [ 4 4 4 , 465–467 ]. Figure 5 b–d show branching fractions 
from  500  – 1000  K  from  Sivaramakrishnan  et  al.  [436] ,  Xu  and 
Lin  [445] ,  and  Zheng  and  Truhlar  [446] .  Sivaramakrishnan  et  al. 
[436] used transition state theory with stationary points calculated 
at the QCISD(T)/CBS level of theory. Xu and Lin [445] computed 
potential energy surfaces at the CCSD(T)/6-311 + G(3 df ,2 p )//MP2/6- 
311 + G(3 df ,2 p ) level of theory and used variational transition state 
theory and RRKM theory with VariFlex [468] . Zheng and Truhlar 
[446] employed MP-VTST level of theory with transmission coeﬃ- 
cients of all reaction paths calculated explicitly from M08-HX/6- 
31 + G( d , p )  potential  energy  surfaces.  The  branching  fractions  in 
Figure 5 b–d show consistency in that α radicals (1-hydroxyethyl) 
are signiﬁcantly favored. However, predictions of the formation of 

β radicals varies from < 5% in [436] , to 10 – 15% in [445] , to 20 –
25% in [446] . 

The  formation of α radicals  dominates branching fractions  in 
reactions  with  ˙ O H  at  temperatures  below  10 0 0  K  [ 76 ,  433–435 , 
4 43 , 4 49 , 460 ] and, in several studies [ 76 , 433–435 ], γ radicals are 
favored second. The consistency in the trend among alcohols, from 
ethanol to 1-butanol, to preferentially form α radicals upon reac- 
tion with  ˙ O H stems primarily from the C–H bond energy of the α
site being the lowest. Although β and γ sites differ from one an- 
other only marginally in bond dissociation energy ( ∼1 kcal/mol), 
for 1-propanol and higher-order alcohols the formation of a stabi- 
lizing hydrogen bond in the transition state between the H atom 
of the abstracting  ˙ O H and the O atom of the –OH group facilitates 
H-abstraction at the γ site up to ∼350 K [469] , above which α
dominates. In the reaction ethanol + ˙ O H → ˙CH 
2 O, sim- 
ilar hydrogen-bonding exists in the transition state for abstraction 
from β carbon. However, for higher-order alcohols such bonding is 
stronger in transition states involving γ carbon [469] . 

2 OH + H 

2 CH 

Expanding on the site-speciﬁc rate coeﬃcient calculations for 
˙ O H + 1-butanol in Galano et al. [469] , Moc and Simmie [440] used 
second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) with mul- 
tiple coupled-cluster and correlation-consistent basis sets to calcu- 
late energies of transition states and related intermediates on the 
potential energy surface of  ˙ O H reactions with the TGt conformer of 
1-butanol [470] , which is the lowest-energy structure. TGt nomen- 
clature in [470] refers to the CC–CC bond in trans - conformation, 
CC–CO  in  gauche -  conformation,  and  CC–OH  in  trans -  conforma- 
tion ( Figure 6 a). Moc and Simmie [440] report hydrogen-bonded 
transition states in  ˙ O H + 1-butanol, including for abstraction from 
δ carbon ( Figure 6 b). Galano et al. [469] utilized a single basis set –
CCSD(T)/6-311G( d , p ) – and identiﬁed hydrogen bonding in all tran- 
sition states for  ˙ O H + 1-butanol, including for abstraction from the 
–OH group, yet neglected abstraction from the δ carbon. 

Barrier  heights  for 

˙ O H + 1-butanol  in  Moc  and  Simmie 
[440] followed α < γ < β < δ < –OH ordering as reported in [ 76 , 
433–435 ]. The order of the barrier heights is different in Galano 
et al. [469] , γ < β < α < –OH, which may reﬂect the use of a 
different basis set considering the range in energy in [440] varied 
up to 2.3 kcal/mol for the same transition state depending on the 
use of double-, triple-, or quadruple- ζ basis sets. Since Moc et al. 
[470] identiﬁed fourteen distinct conformers of 1-butanol within 
a range of 1.86 kcal/mol relative to the TGt conformer adopted in 
[440] , comparison of the results of Galano et al.  [469] and Moc 
and Simmie [440] indicates that the relevance of hydrogen-bonded 
transition states in H-abstraction reactions from 1-butanol is con- 
former dependent. 

Subsequent to Moc and Simmie [440] , Zhou et al. [433] utilized 
CCSD(T)/cc-PVQZ//MP2/6-311G( d , p )  and  G3  methods  with  varia- 
tional  transition  state  theory  to  determine  site-speciﬁc  rate  co- 
eﬃcients for  ˙ O H + 1-butanol. The calculations were conducted to 
differentiate between hydrogen atoms attached to the same car- 
bon  and  the  mechanism  of  abstraction,  which  is  important  due 
to  the  asymmetry  of  1-butanol.  Two  types  of  mechanisms  were 
included:  indirect  abstraction,  which  is  characterized  by  a  step- 
wise  process  involving  the  formation  of  a  reactant  complex  in 
the entrance channel, and direct abstraction, which occurs with- 
out the formation of a complex. The differences between the H- 
atom-speciﬁc rates were substantial, particularly for α and γ sites, 
which are also the most consequential due to large branching frac- 
tions ( Figure 7 b). 

Figure 7 plots total rate coeﬃcients for  ˙ O H + 1-butanol ( Figure 
7 a) and branching fractions in the high-pressure limit. The results 
from Zhou et al. [433] ( Figure 7 b) were calculated at the G3 level 
of theory. Seal et al. [434] ( Figure 7 c) utilized M08-HX/MG3S with 
multi-structural variational transition state theory (MS-VTST) and 
noted the importance of torsional anharmonicity. McGillen et al.

[450] produced Arrhenius parameters for the total k (T) of  ˙ O H + 1- 
butanol from a ﬁt of OH-LIF measurements from 221 – 381 K to 
shock  tube  experiments  of  Pang  et  al.  [471] .  Branching  fractions 
in [450] ( Figure 7 d) were determined analytically by iterative pa- 
rameterization using total rate coeﬃcients and species yields from 
Cavalli et al. [472] and Hurley et al. [473] . While the temperature 
dependence of the three k (T) trends differ, the computational re- 
sults from Zhou et al. [433] and Seal et al. [434] are within 50% of 
the analytical expression of McGillen et al. [450] at 500 K and are 
within 10% at 10 0 0 K. However, similar to ethanol + ˙ O H, branch- 
ing fraction predictions for  ˙ O H + 1-butanol are not consistent. In 
all cases, α radical formation is favored up to 10 0 0 K and abstrac- 
tion of the hydroxylic hydrogen is relatively marginal. However, se- 
lectivity towards γ and β radicals differs signiﬁcantly. Zhou et al. 
[433] predict 35% γ radicals and 5% β radicals at 500 K and, at 
10 0 0  K,  30%  and  6%,  respectively.  The  calculations  of  Seal  et  al. 
[434] show negligible temperature dependence: 13% γ radicals and 
15% β radicals at 500 K, and both are ∼16% at 10 0 0 K. McGillen et 
al. [450] ∼20% of γ radicals and ∼18% of β radicals at both 500 K 
and 10 0 0 K. 

Compared  to  linear  alcohols  with  a  terminal  –OH  functional 
group, e.g. 1-butanol, few studies relevant to low-temperature ox- 
idation exist for alcohols with non-terminal –OH, e.g. 2-propanol 
[469] and 2-butanol [ 451 , 474 ]. Zheng et al. [474] employed canon- 
ical  variational  transition-state  theory  with  small-curvature  tun- 

neling to calculate rate coeﬃcients and branching fractions for H- 
abstraction via  ˙ O H + 2-butanol → ˙ R + H 
2 O. While some dependence 
on computational method was noted, speciﬁcally the selection of 
single or multiple paths in calculation of transmission coeﬃcients, 
abstraction from (tertiary) α carbon and (secondary) β carbon ac- 
counted for 80 – 90% of the radical distribution below 10 0 0 K and 
primary radicals were negligible. Sime et al. [451] measured total 
rate coeﬃcients for  ˙ O H + 2-butanol up to ∼690 K, as well as for 
other isomers of butanol. 

3.1.1.2. Branched alcohols + ˙OH.  Mellouki et al. [475] measured rate 
coeﬃcients for reaction of  ˙ O H with iso -butanol, iso -pentanol, and 
3-methyl-2-butanol  from  241  – 373  K,  which  displayed  negative 
temperature  dependence  similar  to  reactions  of  ˙ O H  with  linear 
alcohols [449] . Branching fractions were measured at ∼1 atm in 
McGillen et al. [ 450 , 476 ] for  ˙ O H + iso -butanol from 251 – 340 K 
[476] , where abstraction from α carbon increased with tempera- 
ture to nearly 50% at 340 K for all four butanol isomers [450] –
1-butanol, 2-butanol, iso -butanol, and tert -butanol. In McGillen et 
al. [450] , site-speciﬁc rate coeﬃcients were ﬁt analytically over the 
temperature range 220 – 1800 K by combining pulsed-photolysis 
measurements  of  k (T)  with  prior  measurements  [ 4 47 ,  4 48 ,  471 , 
477 ]. The trends for all isomers followed non-Arrhenius behavior 
( E a < 0), suggesting the formation of a pre-reaction complex. Tran-

Figure  8 a  compares  branching  fractions  from  McGillen  et  al. 
[450] for H-abstraction from tert -butanol by  ˙ O H via two different 
mechanisms:  β

complex.  The  latter  mechanism  is  relatively  insigniﬁcant  and,  in 

direct  and  β

contrast to other alcohols, abstraction of hydroxylic hydrogen con- 
tributes to 15 – 20% of the initial radical population of tert -butanol.

for iso -butanol and tert -butanol, and from Zheng et al. [478] for 
iso -butanol over the range 500 – 10 0 0 K. The larger k (T) for iso - 
butanol is consistent with the availability of weakly bound hydro-

gen on both α carbon and on tertiary carbon, as opposed to tert - 
butanol in which only primary C–H bonds exist. 

The  analytical  rate  expression  from  McGillen  et  al.  [450]  for 
the  total  rate  coeﬃcient  of  ˙ O H + iso -butanol  is  consistent  with 
the  quantum  chemical  calculations  of  Zheng  et  al.  [478] .  Em- 
ploying multi-path variational transition-state theory with small- 
curvature tunneling, Zheng et al. [478] included torsional anhar- 
monicity  in  the  partition  function  calculations  for  reactants  and 
transition states using multi-structural methods. The inclusion of 
anharmonicity  along  the  reaction  path  signiﬁcantly  affected  k (T) 
and  branching  fractions  compared  to  the  standard  approach  of 
scaling harmonic vibrational frequencies. Figure 8 c plots branch- 
ing fractions for iso -butanol from McGillen et al. [450] , which were 
derived analytically via iterative solution of Arrhenius rate param- 
eters, to total rate coeﬃcients and species yields from Andersen et 
al. [479] , Baxley and Wells [480] , and Chew and Atkinson [481] . 
Similar to ethanol, α radicals are favored, although β and γ rad- 
icals combine for ∼60% of the branching fraction. Despite agree- 
ment  on  the  total  rate  coeﬃcient  in  the  range  500  – 1000  K, 
branching fractions computed in Zheng et al. [478] ( Figure 8 d) dif- 
fer with McGillen et al. [450] , mainly in the temperature depen- 
dence for α and γ sites. From Zheng et al. [478] , α radicals ac- 
count for ∼65%, compared to 50% (500 K) to 40% (10 0 0 K), while 
γ radicals account for ∼10% compared to 15 – 30% from McGillen 
et al. [450] . 

Xing et al. [482] utilized multi-path variational transition state 
theory with small-curvature tunneling (MP-CVT/SCT) to calculate 
site-speciﬁc rate coeﬃcients and branching fractions for  ˙ O H + iso - 
pentanol → H 
2 O + ˙ R .  The  effects  of  several  corrections  were  ex- 
amined,  including  re-crossing,  tunneling,  and  multiple  structure 
anharmonicity,  the  latter  of  which  being  most  signiﬁcant.  The 
branching fraction calculations were compared to results from con- 
ventional transition state theory, which produced different temper- 
ature dependence among the ﬁve abstraction channels, with the 
main impact being the balance between primary ( δ) carbon and 
tertiary ( γ ) carbon. Branching fractions from α, β, and –OH sites 
were  relatively  unaffected.  Using  the  variational  method,  at  750 
K, the branching fractions for δ and γ were ∼20% and ∼15%, re- 
spectively, while conventional transition state theory yielded ∼5% 
and ∼30%. Additional comparisons in Xing et al. [482] to branching 
fractions predicted from chemical kinetics mechanisms of Sarathy 
et  al.  [483]  and  Tsujimura  et  al.  [484] ,  both  of  which  utilized 
rate rules for prescribing rate parameters, reveal appreciable dif- 
ferences, yet abstraction from α carbon remains favored above 600 
K. 

3.1.1.3. Linear  alcohols + HO ˙O.  Abstraction  of  hydrogen  by  HO ˙O  is 
signiﬁcantly  less  facile  than  by  ˙OH  and  is  dominated  by  reac- 
tion  at  the α site.  Zhao  et  al.  [394]  employed  conventional  and 
canonical variational transition state theory to calculate rate coef- 
ﬁcients for H-abstraction from ethanol by HO ˙ O . Potential energy 
surfaces were calculated using both CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//M06-2x/def- 
TZVP and CCSD(T)/CBS//M06-2x/def- TZVP levels of theory, and rate 
calculations below 750 K included zero-curvature tunneling correc- 
tions.  The  results  using  both  methods  were  consistent  with  one 
another over the range of temperatures covered (200 – 20 0 0 K). 
Two motivations for Zhao et al. [75] were (i) to provide rate coef- 
ﬁcient calculations for HO ˙ O + ethanol → ˙ R + H 
2 and (ii) to deter- 
mine the reliability of the using Arrhenius parameters extrapolated 
from  HO ˙ O + 1-butanol  calculated  in  Zhou  et  al.  [76]  in  chemical 
kinetics mechanisms for ethanol. For the latter of the two, igni- 
tion delay times were simulated ( vide infra ) with chemical kinetics 
mechanisms of Curran et al. [485] and Jin et al. [486] using un- 
modiﬁed versions and other versions modiﬁed with the coupled 
cluster calculations. 

2 O 

Pre-reaction  complexes  were  formed  in  all  three  abstraction 
channels in Zhao et al. [75] , α, β, and –OH ( Figure 9 ), with well- 
depths of –9.2 kcal/mol, –1.0 kcal/mol, and –9.0 kcal/mol, respec- 
tively; the well-depth for the α site is consistent with Zhou et al. 
[76]  for  abstraction  from α carbon  in  1-butanol  (–9.3  kcal/mol). 
The deeper wells for both α and –OH were explained in [75] us- 
ing independent gradient modeling [487] , which revealed hydro- 
gen bonding between the H atom in HO ˙ O and the O atom in the 
hydroxyl  group  with  interaction  distances  of  ∼1.70  ˚A  ( Figure  9 a 
and  c).  For  abstraction  from β carbon,  weaker  interaction  exists 
between the terminal O atom in HO ˙ O and an H atom on α carbon 
(HOO (cid:2)H ∼2.61  ˚A). 

3 CH 

Total  rate  coeﬃcients  and  site-speciﬁc  Arrhenius  parameters 
were calculated in the high-pressure limit from 200 – 2000 K for 
each of the three abstraction channels. Figure 10 a plots k ( T ) from 
50 0 – 10 0 0 K. As indicated in the branching fractions from Zhao 
et  al.  [75]  in  Figure  10 b,  abstraction  from  α carbon  dominates, 
whereas  from  β carbon  and  from  the  –OH  group  abstraction  is 
negligible below 10 0 0 K. At 150 0 K, the branching fraction towards 
α radicals is ∼94% and for β radicals is ∼5%. The overwhelming se- 
lectivity by HO ˙ O towards α radicals (CH 
3 ˙CHOH) is a result of the 
barrier height being the lowest lying channel on the HO ˙ O + ethanol 
surface  (by  5.5  kcal/mol).  The  barrier  to  H-abstraction  from  the 
2 ˙ O is lower by 3.0 
–OH group forming the ethoxy radical CH 
kcal/mol than from β carbon, despite higher bond energy. Distor- 
tion/interaction  modeling  [488] ,  which  calculates  transition  state 
energy as the sum of strain energy and interaction energy, revealed 
that while the former is higher for H-abstraction at the hydroxyl 
group, the interaction energy is signiﬁcantly higher ( ∼28 kcal/mol) 
than for abstraction from β carbon [75] . However, because of hy- 
drogen  bonding  stabilizing  the  pre-reaction  complex,  the  overall 
barrier height for abstraction from the –OH group is higher by 5.0 
kcal/mol, which results in abstraction remaining negligible ( ∼1%). 
Similar  to  ˙ O H,  Glarborg  et  al.  [464]  noted  discrepancies  among 
chemical kinetics mechanisms for abstraction reactions of ethanol 
with HO ˙ O . 

The rate coeﬃcients in Zhao et al. [75] for abstraction from α, 
β, and –OH sites were compared to analogous rates from Zhou et 
al. [76] calculated for 1-butanol and to several chemical kinetics 
mechanisms for ethanol. For abstraction from α carbon, rate co- 
eﬃcients were within uncertainty estimations, which is important 
given the dominance of the branching fraction indicated in Figure 
10 b. For abstraction from β carbon, the Zhou et al. [76] calcula- 
tions were also within the uncertainty bands of the coupled clus- 
ter calculations for HO ˙ O + ethanol, while rates from the chemical 
kinetics mechanisms were higher by up to ∼10 2 . However, because 
calculations for ethanol predict consistently that H-abstraction by 
HO ˙ O occurs almost exclusively at the α carbon below 10 0 0 K [ 459 , 
460 , 462 , 489 , 490 ], the uncertainties in branching to  ˙CH 
2 OH 
is likely unimportant for modeling ignition.

Black and Simmie [453] conducted an extensive series of bar- 
rier height calculations on the HO ˙ O + 1-butanol surface, accounting 
for conformer-speciﬁc transition states (10 in total) and the inﬂu- 
ence of computational method by using a range of DFT functionals 
and basis sets. Pre- and post-reaction complexes were identiﬁed 
for all cases except for abstraction from δ carbon. Only abstraction 
from β carbon exhibited H-atom-speciﬁc barrier heights, with the 
lowest in energy (by approximately 2 kcal/mol) being when the H 
atom being abstracted is in the plane of the –OH group leading to 
hydrogen-bonding between HO ˙ O and the –OH group. Such a stabi- 
lizing interaction is not present for H atoms that extend away from 
the –OH group. For all pathways, barrier heights followed the same 
order as in reactions with  ˙ O H and in the direction of increasing 
endothermicity: α < γ < β < δ < –OH. The lower barrier height 
of the γ carbon compared to β carbon is ascribed to rotation of 
the –OH group about the C–O bond in the transition state, which

creates a stabilizing effect that facilitates hydrogen bonding with 
incoming HO ˙ O and contributes to the difference of 1 kcal/mol. The 
barrier height to abstraction from δ carbon was nearly identical to 
that in alkanes. Abstraction from α carbon by HO ˙ O occurs with the 
lowest barrier, by 2.3 kcal/mol, similar to reactions with  ˙ O H [440] . 
Zhou et al. [76] utilized conventional transition state theory to 
calculate site-speciﬁc rate coeﬃcients and branching fractions for 
H-abstraction  from  1-butanol  by  HO ˙ O  from  500  – 2000  K.  For- 
mation  of  the α radical,  (butan-1-ol-1-yl,  H 
2 ˙CHOH),  re- 
mained the dominant pathway over the entire range of tempera- 
ture and branching fractions remained > 0.75 below 10 0 0 K. From 
50 0 – 70 0 K, branching to γ radicals was favored over β radicals 
and branching towards α radicals remained above 0.90. Zhou et 
al. [76] noted differences in branching fractions produced from the 
rate calculations of Vranckx et al. [435] and suggested torsional an- 
harmonicity treatment and tunneling as potential sources of error. 
Site-speciﬁc  rate  coeﬃcients  for  the  α radical  were  calcu- 
lated  by  Alecu  et  al.  [439]  and  for  the  γ radical  (butan-1-ol-3- 
yl,  H 
2 OH)  by  Seal  et  al.  [452]  using  multi-structural 
canonical variational transition-state theory with multidimensional 
small-curvature  tunneling  (MS-CVT/SCT).  Rate  coeﬃcients  calcu- 
lated  in  Zhou  et  al.  [76]  overlap  remarkably  with  the  results  of 
Alecu  et  al.  [439]  for  HO ˙ O + 1-butanol → H 
2 ˙CH–
OH  ( α radical),  yet  differ  from  Seal  et  al.  [452]  for  HO ˙ O + 1-

10 0 0  K.  Figure  11  plots  the  total  rate  coeﬃcient  and  branching 
fractions  for  HO ˙ O + 1-butanol → H

Bao et al. [491] calculated rate coeﬃcients in the high-pressure 
limit for HO ˙ O + 2-butanol → H 
2 + ˙ R using multi-path variational 
transition state theory (MP-VTST) with small-curvature tunneling 
approximations for anharmonicity factors. Branching fractions were 
calculated and were qualitatively similar to 1-butanol in that, be- 
low 10 0 0 K, abstraction of α hydrogen accounted for the majority

16 

( > 80%) of the radical distribution, which creates tertiary radicals in 
the case of 2-butanol. Abstraction of secondary β hydrogen is the 
only other signiﬁcant abstraction site below 10 0 0 K – the other 
three sites (primary β, primary δ, and –OH) combined for < 10%. 
Bao et al. [491] also conducted comprehensive analysis on the con- 
nection between hydrogen bonding in transition states and activa- 
tion energy for abstraction. Relative potential energies were calcu- 
lated for three types of transition states – non-hydrogen bonded, 
bent hydrogen bonding, and non-bent hydrogen bonding between 
the H of the HO ˙ O radical and the O of the –OH group. From Chen 
et al. [492] , a normal hydrogen bond occurs for O–H (cid:2)O interac- 
tions ≤ 2.4  ˚A and an O–H–O angle ≥150 ° and a strongly bent hy- 
drogen bond occurs when 90 ° < θ < 150 °. Hydrogen bonding oc- 
curred in three of the ﬁve transition states – α (tertiary), β (sec- 
ondary), and γ (primary). One conclusion drawn from the results 
in Bao et al. [491] is that hydrogen bonding lowers activation en- 
ergies for abstraction by 2 – 3 kcal/mol. However, because of the 
coupling between stabilization and the reduction in entropy of the 
transition state, (cid:6)S (cid:8) = , and despite lower barrier heights, hydrogen 
bonding can lead to a decrease in k (T) for cases where entropy is 
decreased signiﬁcantly. No signiﬁcant dependence of potential en- 
ergy on the O–H–O angle in the transition state was noted.

3.1.1.4. Branched alcohols + HO ˙O.  Parab et al. [493] calculated site-

tions from 500 – 2000 K using the CBS-QB3 composite method for 
HO ˙ O + iso -pentanol → H 
2 + ˙ R ( Figure 12 ). Hydrogen bonding was 
evident in transition states for H-abstraction from all four sites: α, 
β, γ , and δ carbon. Similar to reactions with other alcohols, ab- 
straction from α carbon remained the dominant channel [ 76 , 459 , 
460 , 462 ]. However, in contrast to reactions with other alcohols, 
rate coeﬃcients on a per-H-atom basis for abstraction from δ car- 
bon, which make up the two methyl groups, are competitive near 
750 K. In addition, total rate coeﬃcients for abstraction from δ car- 
bon exceed that for α carbon by nearly 10 1 at 10 0 0 K despite C–H

bond dissociation energies at that site being unaffected by the al- 
cohol group. The difference is in part due to stabilization energy 
in the transition state from hydrogen bonding. For similar reasons, 
rate coeﬃcients below 10 0 0 K for abstraction from (tertiary) γ car- 
bon were higher than from (secondary) γ carbon in 1-butanol [76] . 
Stabilization energy in the transition state also impacted abstrac- 
tion from β carbon, leading to rate coeﬃcients nearly 10 1 higher 
than for direct abstraction.

ever, the lower barrier height for abstraction from the –OH group, 
as compared to abstraction from γ , β, or δ sites [457] , branching 
4 + ˙ R favor α and 
fractions below 10 0 0 K for  ˙CH

3.1.2. Reactions of initial radicals with O 2 

The  –OH  functional  group  in  alcohols  favors  reaction  path- 
ways with O 
2  that inhibit chain-branching compared to n -alkane 
oxidation  (cf.  Figure  1 ).  Three  pathways  in  particular  are  de- 
picted  in  Figure  14  using  radicals  derived  from  1-butanol:  di- 
rect  aldehyde + HO ˙ O  formation  from  α- ˙ R + O 
2  (chain-inhibiting, 
weakly  exothermic),  Figure  14 a,  a  Waddington-type  mechanism 
(chain-propagating, moderately exothermic), Figure 14 b, and water- 
elimination  from  γ - ˙ Q OOH  radicals  (chain-propagating,  strongly 
exothermic), Figure 14 c [301] . Subsequent reactions of oxy radicals 
from the latter species include reaction with O 
2 to form dicarbonyl 
species coincident with HO ˙ O . 

The  importance of the  ﬁrst  pathway ( Figure 14 a) stems  from 
the fact that branching fractions favor α radicals in the initiation 
step of alcohols, which are responsible for the high yield of alde- 
hydes.  Facile  H-abstraction  from α carbon  and  subsequent  reac- 
tion  of  α-hydroxy  radicals  with  O 
2  leads  preferentially  to  alde- 
hyde + HO ˙ O [ 295 , 296 , 4 94-4 96 ] and is weakly dependent on both 
pressure [497-501] and temperature [500] due to the lack of sta- 

bilization of chemically activated α-RO ˙ O . Although at similar con- 
ditions  the  rate  coeﬃcient  for  H-abstraction  at  the α carbon  by 
˙ O H is ∼10 4 higher than abstraction by HO ˙ O [ 434 , 439 ], reactions 
of the latter type are important for predicting alcohol ignition de- 
lay times [ 97 , 502-504 ] because of the tendency of α radicals to- 
wards aldehyde + HO ˙ O as opposed to undergoing chain-branching. 
Higher concentration of HO ˙ O therefore compounds aldehyde for- 
mation, the pathways of which proceed over lower barriers com- 
pared to the analogous reaction in alkanes due to the higher ther- 
modynamic stability of C = O bonds compared to C = C bonds. 

Duan et al. [505] calculated rate coeﬃcients for unimolecular 
reactions of stabilized 1-hydroxy-1-peroxypentyl, the α-RO ˙ O rad- 
ical  of  1-petnanol,  at  the  CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/cc-pVTZ 
level  of  theory.  Pressure-dependent  rate  coeﬃcients  were  calcu- 
lated  using  QRRK  theory.  In  total,  rate  coeﬃcients  were  calcu- 
lated  for  seven  reactions  to  determine  the  competition  between 
RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization and HOO-elimination, which yields ei- 
ther  pent-1-en-1-ol + HO ˙ O  or  pentanal + HO ˙ O .  Rates  for  the  lat- 
ter reaction were several orders of magnitude higher to the point 
where isomerization reactions and the enol-forming channels were 
deemed unimportant. 

The second pathway important in low-temperature alcohol ox- 
idation  is  a  Waddington-type  mechanism  ( Figure  14 b),  which  is 
chain-propagating and leads to the formation of two carbonyl in- 
termediates  and  an  ˙ O H  radical  [ 295 ,  296 ,  494 ,  506 ].  The  path- 
way  differs  from  the  conventional  Waddington  mechanism  [ 507 , 
508 ] in that the hydroxyl-peroxy radical is not the result of OH- 
2 -addition to an initial 
addition to unsaturated carbon. Instead, O 
alcohol radical forms the hydroxy-peroxy radical, which then ab- 
stracts the hydroxylic H-atom and subsequently decomposes. Li et 
al.  [509]  conducted  systematic  ab  initio  and  rate  coeﬃcient  cal- 
culations  for  isomerization  reactions  (via  6-membered  transition 
states) of hydroxy-peroxy radicals derived from isomers of butene

and  of  butanol,  and  subsequent  decomposition  reactions  via  the 
Waddington  mechanism.  In  total,  potential  energy  surfaces  were 
calculated for ﬁve unique pathways. All of the isomerization steps, 
where an oxy radical is produced by abstraction of H from the –OH 
group by the –O ˙ O group, were ∼25 kcal/mol. Barrier heights for 
decomposition of the oxy radicals varied depending on molecular 
structure and were higher for radicals derived from 1-butanol and 
2-butanol ( ∼6-7 kcal/mol) than for radicals derived from butene 
isomers ( ∼3-4 kcal/mol). 

The  third  pathway,  water-elimination  ( Figure  14 c),  arises  due 
to the presence of labile hydrogen on the α carbon, which facil- 
itates RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization. Using ab initio calculations on 
iso -pentanol + O 
2 potential energy surfaces, Welz et al. [301] iden- 
tiﬁed a low-lying exothermic water-elimination channel evident in 
alcohol oxidation, which explained a prior discrepancy in acetone 
yield [295] . The mechanism involves concerted abstraction of the 
hydroxylic hydrogen by the OH moiety of the hydroperoxy group 
in  ˙ Q OOH and O–O bond-scission and leads to an oxy radical with 
a carbonyl group and H 
2 O. The water-elimination channel is poten- 
tially speciﬁc to alcohols – CBS-QB3 calculations for a similar chan- 
nel  in  ketone  oxidation  (3-pentanone)  revealed  a  barrier  height 
> 20 kcal/mol higher in energy [299] . 

The  sections  below  review  MPIMS  experiments  and  ab  ini- 
tio calculations on alcohol oxidation, namely 1-butanol [296] , iso - 
butanol [494] , iso -pentanol [295] , prenol and iso -prenol [506] . No 
MPIMS studies exist for 2-butanol oxidation despite other experi- 
mental and modeling studies [ 4 41 , 4 47 , 474 , 491 , 510-515 ]. Simi-

3.1.2.1. Reactions  of  initial  radicals  from  primary  alcohols  with  O 2 . 
Welz et al. [296] conducted chlorine atom-initiated oxidation ex- 
periments  of  1-butanol  up  to  700  K  using  MPIMS  and  calcu- 
lated  stationary  point  energies  on  the  four  ˙ R + O 
2  potential  en- 
ergy surfaces using CBS-QB3. Deuterated isotopologues 1-butanol- 
1,1-d 
3  were also employed to conﬁrm re- 
action  mechanisms  postulated  from  the  undeuterated  1-butanol 
experiments. The main emphasis in [296] was the determination 
of initial radical-speciﬁc oxidation pathways inferred from isomer- 
resolved photoionization spectra. Several species were quantiﬁed, 
including  HOO-elimination  products  (butanal  and  2-buten-1-ol) 
and carbonyls formed via C–C and/or C–O β-scission (e.g. propanal, 
acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde). 

Despite energetically competitive pathways on the surfaces of 
β-, γ -, and δ-RO ˙ O radicals, none of the six possible cyclic ethers 
( Figure 15 ) were detected due either to low ionization eﬃciency 
or substantial dissociative ionization. In some cases, fragment ions 
provided indirect evidence. For example, appearance energy calcu- 
lations  in  [296]  for  the  ionization  of  2-hydroxy-4-methyloxetane 
indicated  that  the  cation  undergoes  facile  ring-opening  to  yield 
6 ] + ,  the  latter  of 
(neutral)  formic  acid  and  propene  cation  [C 
which was quantiﬁed in the experiments.

To  complement  the  ionization  calculations  in  Welz  et  al. 
[296]  and  examine  the  propensity  for  poor  Franck-Condon  over- 
lap and dissociative ionization, geometry optimization calculations 
were  conducted  at  the  CBS-QB3  level  for  the  present  review  on 
two  representative  cyclic  ethers:  2-hydroxy-4-methyloxetane  and 
2-oxetanemethanol ( Figure 16 ). In both cases, signiﬁcant geometry 
changes in the cation are evident. For 2-hydroxy-4-methyloxetane, 
the C–O bond distance of the ether group increases from 1.439 to 
2.122  ˚A ( Figure 16 a). The cationic state is bound, yet the Franck- 
Condon overlap likely diminishes signiﬁcantly due to the large ge- 
ometry change. Ionization of 2-oxetanemethanol ( Figure 16 b) in- 
creases the  length of  the C–C  bond adjacent to  the ether group 
from 1.516 to 1.750  ˚A, which causes dissociation into a fragment 
ion  and  a  neutral  fragment.  Transient  ion  signal  in  the  experi- 
ments of Welz et al. [296] was not detected at the mass of the

Because  of  the  direct  connection  to  ˙ Q OOH  radicals,  closed- 
shell intermediates, and cyclic ethers in particular, often provide 
the  most  direct  means  of  inferring  reaction  pathways.  Figure  17 
shows the potential energy surface for δ-RO ˙ O in 1-butanol from 
which  four  pathways  are  possible:  direct  HOO-elimination  and 
three  ˙ Q OOH-mediated  pathways.  The  formation  of  but-3-en-1-ol 
is  a  minor  channel,  with  yields  of  ∼1%  [296] .  Because  the  bar- 
rier heights between the  ˙ O H-forming pathways calculated in Welz 
et al. [296] differ by only 3 kcal/mol, and are within the uncer- 
tainty of the theoretical method [ 517 , 518 ], direct speciation mea- 
surements of 4-hydroxybutanal and 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran are 
necessary – as are measurements for similar closed-shell interme- 
diates for other RO ˙ O radicals of 1-butanol – to validating theoreti- 
cal calculations of  ˙ Q OOH decomposition rates. 

Employing partially deuterated isotopologues of 1-butanol con- 
ﬁrmed that propanal is formed with the carbonyl group on the β
carbon in 1-butanol, as expected both from the Waddington and 
water-elimination mechanisms ( Figure 18 ). Although no direct evi-

cation  via  photoionization  of  vinoxy  radical,  a  co-product  of  3-

The complexity of 1-butanol oxidation is evident from the PES 
calculations  in  Welz  et  al.  [296] .  The  water-elimination  channel, 
which  requires  peroxy  radical  formation,  is  available  in  three  of 
the  four  initial  radicals  ( β,  γ ,  and  δ).  RO ˙ O  formation  is  likely 
not possible for α radicals because of the inability to form a sta- 
bilized  adduct.  In  each  of  the  three  water-elimination  pathways, 
˙ Q OOH  intermediates  may  traverse  several  decomposition  path- 
ways  and  barrier  heights  for  the  various  channels  are  within  2 
kcal/mol,  with  the  exception  of  γ - ˙ Q OOH  for  which  the  water- 
elimination  channel  is  the  lowest  (by  6.8  kcal/mol),  followed 
by 3-hydroxybutanal + ˙ O H and 4-methyloxetan-2-ol + ˙ O H, then β- 
scission into acetaldehyde + vinyl alcohol + ˙ O H ( Figure 19 ). Because 
direct detection of water-elimination products is diﬃcult, since the 
quantiﬁcation of oxy radicals is required, direct measurements of 
the other  ˙ Q OOH decomposition products are necessary.

2 CH ˙CHOH  with  O 

3.1.2.2. Reactions of initial radicals from branched alcohols with O 2 . 
Welz  et  al.  [494]  conducted  photoionization  mass  spectrome- 
try  experiments  from  550  – 700  K  to  measure  products  from 
˙ R + O 
2 reactions of iso -butanol. Of the three HOO-elimination prod- 
ucts  – methylpropanal,  2-methyl-2-propen-1-ol,  and  2-methyl-1- 
propen-1-ol  – the  latter  two  were  minor,  accounting  for  ∼5% 
and ∼1%, respectively; methylpropanal + HO ˙ O forms exclusively via 
reactions  of  α radicals  (CH 
2 .  Other  reactions 
that  consume  ˙ Q OOH  and  inhibit  second-O 
2 -addition  were  con- 
ﬁrmed,  including  acetone + formaldehyde + ˙ O H  (from  β-RO ˙ O  via 
the  Waddington  mechanism)  and  C–C  β-scission  of  γ -RO ˙ O  into 
propene + hydroxymethyl. Two Waddington channels are possible 
in iso -butanol oxidation, one from β-RO ˙ O and the other from γ - 
RO ˙ O . Based on the higher acetone yield relative to the two HOO- 
elimination products from β-RO ˙ O radicals (2-methyl-2-propen-1- 
ol and 2-methyl-1-propen-1-ol), Welz et al. [494] concluded that 
the Waddington mechanism ( Figure 20 ) is the dominant pathway 
for  iso -butanol,  which  is  consistent  with  the  predictions  of  Sun 
et al. [519] . Similar rationale, based on formaldehyde yield, led to 
the  conclusion  that  γ -RO ˙ O  radicals  from  iso -butanol  favor  reac- 
tion via the Waddington mechanism over HOO-elimination. Analo- 
gous conclusions were drawn for iso -pentanol oxidation in Welz 

Fig. 20.  Product formation from branched alcohols via the Waddington mechanism

et  al.  [295] ,  where  Waddington  channels  produced  species  such 
as iso -butyraldehyde + formaldehyde (from β-RO ˙ O ) as well as 2,2,- 
dimethyloxirane + formaldehyde  and  acetone + ethenol  (from  γ - 
RO ˙ O ). In contrast, as noted in [494] , the results highlight an impor- 
tant difference between oxidation of alcohols and alkanes, noting 
that the corresponding alkane reaction, tert -butyl + O 
2 , undergoes 
HOO-elimination  almost  exclusively  [520] .  The  main  difference 
is  that  the  alcohol  functional  group  promotes  chain-propagating 
pathways via Waddington pathways during low-temperature oxi- 
dation, whereas alkanes favor chain-inhibiting, HO ˙ O -yielding path- 
ways. 

Goldman et al. [501] computed stationary points on potential 
energy surfaces for O 
2 -addition to iso -butanol radicals using cou- 
pled  cluster  methods.  Pressure-dependent  rate  coeﬃcients  were 
calculated using microcanonical master equation analysis. Reaction 
ﬂux of products from chemically activated  ˙ R + O 
2 and collisionally 
stabilized RO ˙ O radicals were modeled up to 100 atm and up to 
1200 K. High-pressure limit rate coeﬃcients for reactions of the 
β peroxy isomer (2-peroxy-2-methylpropan-1-ol) were within an 
order of magnitude of Lizardo-Huerta et al. [521] , in which an ex- 
tensive series of rate calculations were conducted on unimolecular 
reactions of β-RO ˙ O and β- ˙ Q OOH radicals of branched and linear 
alcohols. Discrepancies with Sun et al. [519] were noted and as- 
cribed in Goldman et al. [501] to differences in barrier heights and 
partition function calculations. 

All three radical isomers of iso -butanol – α, β, and γ (cf. Figure 
8 b) – were included in Goldman et al. [501] . Reactions of the α
2 led exclusively to iso -butanal + HO ˙ O through both 
radical with O 
chemical activation and stabilized RO ˙ O routes. Collisional stabiliza- 
2 -addition to the α carbon occurred only above ∼50 atm 
tion for O 
2 with the β radical, at pres- 
and only below 500 K. Reaction of O 
sures  above  1  atm,  led  mainly  to  collisionally  stabilized  β-RO ˙ O

from 500 – 1000 K, above which HOO-elimination became com- 
petitive (forming propen-2-ol as a co-product). Dissociation back 
2  dominated the ﬂux of stabilized β-RO ˙ O , which indi- 
into  ˙ R + O 
cated that partial equilibrium may exist and that secondary prod- 
ucts  govern  the  net  ﬂux  of  oxidation  of  the  β radical.  In  par- 
ticular,  two  product  pairs  were  identiﬁed:  3,3-dimethyloxiran-2- 
ol + ˙ O H and acetone + CH 
2 O + ˙ O H via the Waddington mechanism.

Reactions  of  O 
sional stabilization of γ -RO ˙ O is favored up to ∼900 K at pressures 
higher than 1 atm. Above 900 K, and up to ∼25 atm, approximately 
40% of the reaction ﬂux proceeded via a well-skipping mechanism 
through water-elimination forming 2-methoxypropanal + H 
2 O. Two 
competing channels dominate unimolecular reaction of collision- 
ally stabilized γ -RO ˙ O above 500 K: back dissociation and water- 
elimination. For all three radicals, the lack of signiﬁcant  ˙ Q OOH for- 
mation  inhibits  the  second-O 
2 -addition  step  that  is  required  for 
low-temperature chain-branching. 

In  iso -pentanol  oxidation  [295] ,  Waddington  mechanisms  oc- 
curred  via  6-,  7-,  and  8-membered  transition  states.  The  lat- 
ter  two  were  conﬁrmed  by  detection  of  2,2-dimethyloxirane, 
which forms from both γ -RO ˙ O and δ-RO ˙ O . β-RO ˙ O radicals yield 
iso -butanal + HO ˙ O  via  the  Waddington  mechanism  through  a  6- 
membered transition state. Cyclic ethers were not detected in iso - 
butanol or in iso -pentanol oxidation because of low ionization ef- 
ﬁciency [ 295 , 296 , 494 , 497 ], which may result from poor Franck- 
Condon overlap, dissociative ionization, or from facile cation iso- 
merization and subsequent fragmentation into other species [522] . 
Oxidation  experiments  were  also  conducted  on  tert -butanol  in 
Welz  et  al.  [494] .  The  Waddington  mechanism  from  β-RO ˙ O  led 
to  acetone + CH 
2 O + ˙ O H,  which  were  the  most  abundant  prod- 
ucts  detected.  Unimolecular  decomposition  of  initial  radicals  of

3.1.2.3. Reactions  of  initial  radicals  from  unsaturated  alcohols  with 
O 2 .  In contrast to saturated linear and branched alcohols, exper- 
imental and modeling studies focusing on low-temperature oxida- 
tion mechanisms of unsaturated alcohols are practically nonexis- 
tent. Two exceptions are the studies on prenol and iso -prenol of 
Welz et al. [506] , in which Cl-initiated oxidation experiments were 
conducted using photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS). The 
results were compared with previous MPIMS measurements on iso - 
pentanol  [295] .  Principal  differences  in  unsaturated  alcohol  oxi- 
dation were the Waddington-type mechanism becoming a minor 
channel,  the  dominance  of  HO ˙ O -formation  channels,  and  an  in- 
creased importance of radical-radical reactions due to resonance- 
stabilization  of  the  initial  radicals.  Primary  products  detected  in 
Welz et al. [506] were aldehydes formed via HO ˙ O -elimination in- 
volving  α carbon:  prenal  (3-methyl-2-butenal)  formed  in  prenol 
oxidation and iso -prenal (3-methyl-3-butenal) formed in iso -prenol 
oxidation. Similar to low-temperature oxidation chemistry of sat- 
urated alcohols, the two unsaturated alcohols also disfavor chain- 
branching pathways and no cyclic ethers were detected. 

3.1.3. Speciation from thermally initiated experiments 

Speciation measurements from steady state ﬂow reactors con- 
ducted  on  alcohol  biofuels  include  ethanol  [ 461 ,  464 ,  524 ],  1- 
butanol [ 525 , 526 ], 2-butanol [512] , iso -butanol [512] , 1-pentanol 
[ 495 ,  526 ],  3-pentanol  [527] ,  2-methyl-1-butanol  [528] ,  iso - 
pentanol  [ 483 ,  529 ],  1-hexanol  [526] ,  and  unsaturated  alcohols 
prenol and iso -prenol [530] . 

Haas et al. [524] measured stable species from ethanol oxida- 
tion  under  lean  conditions  ( φ = 0.43  and  0.91)  at  12.5  atm  and 
temperatures ranging from 523 – 903 K. Product formation began 

3 + HO ˙ O → CH 

at ∼650 K and exhibited no two-stage reactivity under the con- 
ditions  examined.  Formaldehyde,  acetaldehyde,  and  ethene  were 
major intermediates. Leplat et al. [461] employed a jet-stirred re- 
actor to measure products from ethanol oxidation at 1 atm from 
890 – 1250 K over a range of equivalence ratios. Decomposition of 
3 ˙ O + ˙ O H, was postulated as a 
methoxy, formed via  ˙CH 
primary source of formaldehyde, accounting for ∼60%. Glarborg et 
al. [464] measured species proﬁles from high-pressure oxidation of 
ethanol in a laminar ﬂow reactor at 50 atm from 600 – 900 K and 
reported similar species as Haas et al. [524] and Leplat et al. [461] , 
namely carbonyls, CO, CO 

2 O. 
Togbé et al. [512] conducted JSR experiments on 2-butanol and 
iso -butanol at 10 atm and compared mole fraction measurements 
of  intermediates  to  1-butanol  measurements  from  Dagaut  et  al. 
[525] .  Despite  the  similarity  in  depletion  proﬁles  of  the  three 
alcohols  ( Figure  21 a),  isomer-dependent  selectivity  in  the  types 
and amounts of aldehydes formed during oxidation was reported. 
Figure  21 b  and  c  compare  formaldehyde  and  acetaldehyde  mole 
fractions, respectively. The differences between the production of 
both carbonyls are primarily below 10 0 0 K, indicating that the de- 
tails  of  ˙ Q OOH-mediated  chemistry  and  Waddington  mechanisms 
vary appreciably depending on the location of the –OH group on 
the alcohol. 

2 , and H 

Togbé [495]  measured  species  proﬁles  at  10  atm  from  1- 
pentanol oxidation using a JSR. Other than pentanal, formed via 
oxidation  of  pentan-1-ol-1-yl  radicals,  no  other  low-temperature 
species  were  reported.  Mole  fractions  were  quantiﬁed  for  1- 
pentene, which may arise from C–O β-scission of pentan-1-ol-2- 
yl radicals. Carbonnier et al. [527] measured species proﬁles from 
3-pentanol  oxidation  at  10  atm  in  a  JSR.  Similar  to  1-pentanol, 
the species proﬁles in [527] did not exhibit two-stage chemistry; 
both [495] and [527] utilized the same JSR and residence time of 
700 ms. Common species such as water, ethene, CO, and CO 
2 , and 
were measured along with typical aldehydes (CH 
2 O, acetaldehyde, 
and propanal). With the exception of pentanal, formed via HOO- 
elimination  from α radicals,  no  other  species  directly  related  to 
peroxy radicals, such as pent-1-en-3-ol from HOO-elimination in 
γ radicals of cyclic ethers, were measured. 

Jet-stirred reactor experiments were conducted on iso -pentanol 
in  Dayma  et  al.  [529]  and  in  Sarathy  et  al.  [483] .  Dayma  et  al. 
[529] measured species proﬁles at 10 atm and from 530 – 1220 
K. Intermediate species predominantly from β-scission reactions, 
including propene, acetaldehyde, iso -butene, and iso -pentene, and 
iso -pentanal were quantiﬁed. However, cyclic ethers species were 
not.  Similar  species  proﬁles  were  measured  in  Sarathy  et  al. 
[483] at 5 atm over the same range of temperature as [529] . Both 
studies are consistent with the low-pressure MPIMS experiments 
of Welz et al. [ 295 , 494 ] on the selectivity of branched alcohols to- 
wards forming aldehydes via concerted HO ˙ O -elimination from RO ˙ O 
and via the Waddington mechanism. 

Similar to iso -pentanol [ 483 , 529 ], species proﬁles measured for 
2-methylbutanol  oxidation  in  the  jet-stirred  reactor  experiments 
of  Serinyel  et  al.  [528]  at  10  atm  and  from  700  – 1200  K  did 
not exhibit two-stage chemistry. Product formation was largely as- 
cribed to β-scission reactions and aldehyde + HO ˙ O formation via 
concerted  reaction  of α radicals  with  O 
2 .  Mole  fractions  of  sev- 
eral  species  measured  in  2-methylbutanol  oxidation  were  com- 
pared to iso -pentanol (i.e. 3-methylbutanol) to assess the inﬂuence 
of the methyl branch location on reaction pathways. The compari- 
son revealed that the depletion proﬁles of both alcohols are simi- 
lar except from 800 – 900 K where 2-methylbutanol consumption 
is  slightly  higher  ( Figure  22 a).  Mole  fraction  proﬁles  from  inter- 
mediate species differed substantially between the two C 
11 OH 
isomers, which is akin to the comparison for 2-butanol and iso - 
butanol at 10 atm in Togbé et al. [512] . Figure 22 b compares the 
mole  fractions  of  methacrolein  as  an  example.  The  main  path-

2-methylbutanal forming 2-methyl-butan-1-al-2-yl, which decom- 
poses  via  C–C β-scission  [528] ;  2-methylbutanal  is  produced  by 
HOO-elimination from the initial α radical of 2-methylbutanol. In 
contrast, pathways to methacrolein in iso -pentanol are indirectly 
related to initial peroxy radicals.

with conclusions in Welz et al. [506] in that the dominant oxida- 
tion pathways lead to prenal/ iso -prenal + HO ˙ O . Oxidation products 
of  iso -prenol  measured  in  De  Bruycker  et  al.  [530]  were  largely 
ascribed  to  secondary  reactions  of  iso -butene  and  formaldehyde 
formed directly via unimolecular decomposition of iso -prenol; no 
products  from  O 
2 -addition  to  initial  radicals  of  iso -prenol  (e.g. 
3-methyl-buta-1,3-dien-1-ol  formed  coincident  with  HO ˙ O  via  a 
chain-inhibiting step) were reported. In prenol oxidation, however, 
3-methyl-2-butenal (formed via HO ˙ O -elimination involving α car- 

bon) was a major product and displayed maxima at 675 K and 800 
K despite no evident two-stage depletion [530] , indicating that the 
location of the C = C bond in the branched alcohol inﬂuenced prod- 
uct formation via  ˙ R + O

3.1.4. Inﬂuence of alcohol oxidation pathways on autoignition 
chemistry 

The  tendency  of  alcohol  oxidation  at  low  temperatures 
to  primarily  follow  chain-inhibiting  pathways,  namely  α- 
˙ R + O 
2 → aldehyde + HO ˙ O ,  and  chain-propagation  pathways  in- 
cluding  the  Waddington  mechanism,  effectively  reduces  the  role 
of second-O 
2 -addition reactions and subsequent chain-branching. 
The net effect on autoignition chemistry is a diminishing of NTC 
behavior  relative  to  the  analogous  n -alkane,  which  is  evident 
in  alcohols  up  to  1-butanol.  NTC  behavior  is  not  observed  in 
experimental ignition delay times of ethanol [ 372 , 504 , 531 , 532 ] 
and is weak in 1-butanol [366] , in contrast to n -alkane behavior 
where  two-stage  ignition  chemistry  is  exhibited  in  propane  ox-

idation  [533-537] .  Ignition  measurements  below  10 0 0  K  are  not 
available  for  propanol  isomers,  while  1-pentanol  exhibits  clear 
NTC behavior [98] . Yang et al. [538] reported shock tube ignition 
delay time measurements from 1050 – 1800 K of propanol isomers 
and propane. Over the range of temperatures covered, 1-propanol 
ignition  delay  times  were  shorter  than  those  of  propane  by  a 
factor  of  ∼3.  The  sections  below  review  ignition  delay  times 
measurements and chemical kinetics modeling of alcohol biofuels 
from ethanol up to 1-octanol. 

3.1.4.1. Ignition delay time measurements.  Ignition delay time mea- 
surements  of  alcohols  using  both  shock  tubes  and  rapid  com- 
pression machines are reported for methanol [ 539 , 540 ], ethanol 
[ 372 ,  4 85 ,  4 89 ,  4 90 ,  504 ,  526 ,  531 ,  541 ,  542 ],  propanol  isomers 
[ 526 ,  543 ],  butanol  isomers  [ 366 ,  435 ,  503 ,  526 ,  544-546 ],  pen- 
tanol isomers [ 98 , 526 , 527 ], prenol isomers [547] , 1-hexanol [98] , 
1-octanol [548] , and cyclopentanol [549] . Experiments measuring 
ignition delay times of ethanol below 10 0 0 K include Heufer et al. 
[531] , Lee et al. [490] , Mittal et al. [504] , Wooldridge et al. [372] , 
Cancino et al. [489] , and Toulson et al. [550] . In all cases, ethanol 
exhibits  single-stage  ignition  chemistry.  Weber  et  al.  [97]  mea- 
sured ignition delay times for 1-butanol using RCM experiments 
at 15 atm and 30 atm from 675 – 925 K. In subsequent experi- 
ments, Weber and Sung [545] conducted ignition measurements of 
2-butanol, iso -butanol, and tert -butanol using an RCM at 15 atm 
and 30 atm over the temperature range 715 – 910 K. Within ex- 
perimental uncertainty, ignition delay times of the three butanol 
isomers were nearly identical at 15 atm while ignition times for 1- 
butanol were shorter by more than a factor of 10 below 775 K. The 
results were similar at 30 atm, in that 1-butanol times were signif- 
icantly shorter, yet 2-butanol and tert -butanol were distinct from 
iso -butanol and the latter species exhibited the longest ignition de- 
lay times. For either pressure, none of the butanol isomers exhib- 
ited NTC behavior. To compare with the corresponding n -alkane, 
Figure 23 a plots ignition delay times of n -butane from Healy et al. 
[96] to 1-butanol from Vranckx et al. [435] and butanol isomers 
from Weber and Sung [545] , and Figure 23 b plots stoichiometric 
iso -butanol ignition delay times at 15 atm from Weber and Sung 
[545] to iso -butane from Gersen et al. [551] . In both comparisons, 
ignition delay times at lower temperature are signiﬁcantly shorter 
for alkane species than the analogous alcohol. 

Heufer  et  al.  [98]  measured  30-atm  non - dilute  ignition  delay 
time trends of 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, and 1-hexanol and compared 
the results to n- alkanes with the same carbon number. Ignition de- 
lay times of the alcohols were shorter in the high-temperature re- 
gion ( > 950 K), likely due to more-facile C–C bond scission. How- 
ever, below 750 K, ignition times were signiﬁcantly longer com- 
pared  to  the  respective  n- alkane.  For  example,  near  650  K,  1- 
pentanol ∼60 ms, compared to n- pentane ∼20 ms. The dominance 

of initial α- ˙ R radicals in alcohols, coupled with the lack of α-RO ˙ O 
stabilization, disfavors isomerization to  ˙ Q OOH and results in longer 
ignition delay times compared to n -alkanes. However, the effects 
of the hydroxy group diminish with increasing size of the aliphatic 
component of the molecule, bringing linear alcohols and n -alkanes 
in  close  similarity,  which  is  evidenced  in  comparison  of  the  ig- 
nition  delay  time  trends  and  NTC  behavior  of  1-butanol  and  1- 
hexanol in Heufer et al. [98] . Comparing n -octanol with n -octane 
reveals a similar trend [548] . 

Ignition delay times of cyclic alcohols are largely unexplored, 
with the exception of the cyclopentanol experiments of Cai et al. 
[ 549 ,  552 ]  at  20  atm  and  40  atm,  over  the  temperature  range 
690  – 1175  K,  and  for  several  equivalence  ratios.  NTC  behav- 
ior  is  not  exhibited  in  cyclopentanol  oxidation.  Figure  24 a  com- 
pares  stoichiometric  ignition  delay  times  for  cyclopentanol  mea- 
sured in [549] at 20 atm against cyclopentane measurements from 
Al Rashidi et al. [553] at the same conditions. In contrast to lin- 
ear  alcohols  of  the  same  carbon  number  ( Figure  24 b),  as  noted 
in [549] , ignition delay times of cyclopentanol are similar to cy- 
clopentane. The two trends are within the stated experimental un- 
certainty of ±20% above ∼900 K. Below ∼825 K, cyclopentanol ig- 
nition delay times are slightly shorter, perhaps due to facile ab- 
straction of tertiary hydrogen and due to 1-hydroxycyclopentan-2- 
yl → cyclopentene + ˙ O H, which occurs via C–O β-scission. No anal- 
ogous reaction yielding  ˙ O H is possible from cyclopentyl. 

Ignition delay time measurements of 1-butanol in Vranckx et 
al. [435] highlighted an important result related to modeling low- 
temperature  autoignition  chemistry  of  alcohols,  namely  the  role 
of  peroxy  radicals  at  high  pressure.  The  Black  et  al.  mechanism 
[432]  most  closely  reproduced  the  shock  tube  measurements  in 
[435] ,  yet  differed  by  more  than  an  order  of  magnitude  below 
900  K.  Two  modiﬁcations  were  implemented  by  Vranckx  et  al. 
[435] into [432] : transition-state-theory-based ab initio calculations 
2 + α- ˙ R and a replacement 
of the rate for HO ˙ O + 1-butanol → H 
2 → ˙ O H + ˙ O H  with  a  higher  value 
of  the  rate  coeﬃcient  for  H 
based on experimental and theoretical studies, and the inclusion 
of fall-off parameters, which led to low-temperature ignition de- 
lay times being reconciled. The work of Vranckx et al. [435] un- 
derscores the connection between global autoignition properties of 
biofuels and fundamental low-temperature oxidation chemistry.

As  with  linear  alcohols  ethanol  [ 372 ,  504 ,  531 ,  532 ]  and 
1-butanol  [ 97 ,  98 ],  branched  alcohols  including  iso -butanol,  2- 
methyl-1-butanol, and iso -pentanol exhibit no signiﬁcant NTC be- 
havior [ 4 83 , 4 84 ] because of facilitation of HO ˙ O forming channels 
2 -addition  to  ˙ Q OOH  radicals  and  subsequent 
relative  to  second-O 
ketohydroperoxide formation [ 295 , 483 , 484 , 512 , 528 , 529 , 555 ]. 
Ignition delay times for iso -pentanol were measured from 1 – 60 
atm in Sarathy et al. [483] and the measurements at 7 atm are

plotted in Figure 25 with the trend for 1-pentanol from Heufer et 
al. [98] . Although the region of overlap below 10 0 0 K is limited, 
the effect of the methyl substituent appears signiﬁcant: at ∼875 K, 
a factor of ∼7. The absence of NTC behavior in iso -pentanol oxi- 
dation is likely due to favorable HOO-elimination reactions of the 
α radical, forming 3-methylbutanal, which is similar to saturated 
linear alcohols [ 295 , 296 , 4 94-4 96 ]. Other factors may include se- 
lectivity towards prenol and iso -prenol formation [295] , which are 
also coincident with HO ˙ O , and reactions via the Waddington mech- 
anism. 

Consistent with Serinyel et al. [528] , ignition delay time mea- 
surements  at  20  and  40  atm  for  2-methyl-1-butanol  showed 
no  signiﬁcant  NTC  behavior  and,  at  temperatures  below  950  K 
[555] , were similar to ignition times of iso -pentanol [483] . Low- 
temperature  chain-branching  is  inhibited  in  2-methyl-1-butanol 
oxidation due to the majority of initiation reactions involving ab- 
straction from α carbon, which creates initial radicals that react 
2 to form 2-methylbutan-1-al + HO ˙ O , and because the most 
with O 
favorable isomerization of β-RO ˙ O and γ -RO ˙ O radicals is to trans- 
fer hydrogen from the α carbon to produce α- β- ˙ Q OOH and α- γ - 
˙ Q OOH radicals, respectively. The ﬁrst preﬁx, α, refers to the posi- 
tion of the carbon atom with the unpaired electron and the second, 
β/ γ , designates the position of the hydroperoxy group relative to 
the –OH group. Subsequent reactions of such radicals led predom- 
inantly to hydroperoxy-substituted aldehyde + HO ˙ O , similar to lin- 
ear alcohols, with second O 
2 -addition being of secondary impor- 
tance. Based on reaction pathway analysis, the mechanism of Park 
et al. [555] indicated that ∼10% of α- γ - ˙ Q OOH undergoes water- 
elimination via the pathway discovered by Welz et al. [301] . Figure 
26 plots ignition delay times of Park et al. [555] for 2-methyl-1- 

butanol with 1-pentanol results from Heufer et al. [98] and iso - 
pentanol from Sarathy et al. [483] . The limited range of temper- 
ature over which the measurements overlap precludes a detailed 
comparison. 

3.1.4.2. Detailed  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms.  Chemical  kinetics 
mechanisms  for  several  alcohols  are  abundant  in  the  literature, 
particularly  for  methanol  [ 459 ,  556-562 ],  ethanol  [ 459-464 ,  485 , 
504 ,  563-565 ],  isomers  of  propanol  [ 543 ,  566-568 ],  isomers  of 
butanol  [ 432 ,  435 ,  509 ,  511 ,  514 ,  515 ,  525 ,  569-576 ],  isomers  of 
pentanol  [ 437 ,  483 ,  484 ,  495 ,  505 ,  516 ,  528 ,  529 ,  555 ],  and  to 
a  lesser  extent  for  1-hexanol  [577] ,  prenol/ iso -prenol  [530] ,  1- 
octanol  [548] ,  and  cyclopentanol  [549] .  The  comprehensive  re- 
view of Sarathy et al. [100] summarized the status of chemical ki- 
netics mechanisms for predicting alcohol oxidation and autoigni- 
tion, and provided an overview of rate rules and other details re- 
lated to mechanism development. Chemical kinetics mechanisms 
were  developed  for  several  alcohols  since  the  review  of  Sarathy 
et al. [100] , including for methanol [562] , ethanol [ 460 , 464 ], 2- 
methylbutanol [ 528 , 555 ], prenol/ iso -prenol [530] , 1-octanol [548] , 
and  cyclopentanol  [549] .  Pelucchi  et  al.  [576]  developed  an  ex- 
tensive chemical kinetics mechanism using rate rules and lump- 
ing procedures that combines linear alcohols from 1-propanol up 
to 1-hexanol. The mechanism includes alternative reactions, such 
as HOO-elimination from  ˙ Q OOH yielding carbonyl-hydroperoxides, 
˙ Q OOH dehydration reactions, chain-propagation of HOO ˙ P OOH rad- 
icals derived from second-O 
2 -addition pathways and yielding car- 
bonyl alkyl hydroperoxides, and Korcek reactions of ketohydroper- 
oxides were also included. 

Burke  et  al.  [562]  constructed  a  revised  mechanism  for 
methanol  using  Metcalfe  et  al.  [459]  as  a  base  mechanism.

The revision contained updated thermochemistry [578] and sub- 
mechanisms for H 
2  [579] and for propene [580] . Several rate 
parameters  were  updated  as  well,  including  pressure-dependent 
unimolecular decomposition rates from Jasper et al. [581] and ab- 
straction by  ˙ O H [445] , HO ˙ O [582] ,  ˙CH 

3 [583] , and other radicals.

Olm et al. [460] employed a hierarchical optimization approach 
to  develop  a  mechanism  for  ethanol  using  the  methodology  of 
Turányi et al. [ 65 , 584 ]. The mechanism of Saxena and Williams 
[585] was used as the starting point for the optimization, which 
involved  optimization  of  all  three  Arrhenius  parameters  instead 
of  only  the  pre-exponential  factor  A ,  which  is  the  typical  ap- 
proach. Temperature-dependent uncertainties of optimized rate co- 
eﬃcients were estimated. Glarborg et al. [464] developed a mecha- 
nism for ethanol using rate parameters and thermochemistry from 
the  literature  for  hydrogen  [586]  and  C1/C2  hydrocarbons  [ 561 , 
587-590 ],  and  thermal  decomposition  rates  from  Sivaramakrish- 
nan et al. [436] . Because of discrepancies in rate coeﬃcients for 
H-abstraction by  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O , ignition delay time predictions be- 
low 10 0 0 K differed by an order of magnitude with experiments 
[ 4 89 ,  4 90 ,  531 ].  Independent  of  Glarborg  et  al.  [464] ,  Zhang  et 
al. [485] produced a mechanism for ethanol using base chemistry 
from Metcalfe et al. [459] and Kéromnès et al. [579] and the sub- 
mechanism for ethanol from Mittal et al. [504] . Rate parameters 
for H-atom abstraction, ethanol radical decomposition and reaction 
with O 
2 were adjusted in the mechanism with guidance from sen- 
sitivity analysis. 

2 O 

Subsequent  to  comparing  site-speciﬁc  rate  coeﬃcients  for 
HO ˙ O + ethanol → ˙ R + H 
2 , and in order to examine the inﬂuence 
of integrating the calculated rate coeﬃcients into previous chemi- 
cal kinetics mechanisms [ 4 85 , 4 86 ], Zhao et al. [75] conducted ig- 
nition delay time  simulations.  For  all cases,  ignition delay times 
were longer than predictions using the unmodiﬁed models. Using a 
modiﬁed version of the Curran et al. [485] mechanism, the temper- 
ature and pressure conditions of shock tube measurements from 
Noorani et al. [542] at 2 atm and from Cancino et al. [489] at 50 
atm were utilized. In both cases, discrepancies were noted towards 
lower temperature where the dominant reaction path for ethanol 
is the formation of acetaldehyde + HO ˙ O . Because of the similarity 
to  rates  from  coupled  cluster  calculations,  Zhao  et  al.  [75]  con- 
cluded that the commonly used analogies for rate parameters de- 
rived from 1-butanol are suitable and that existing discrepancies in 
chemical kinetics model predictions of ethanol ignition delay times 
are more likely due to deﬁcient sub-mechanisms for primary inter- 
mediates such as acetaldehyde and vinyl alcohol. 

Serinyel  et  al.  [528]  developed  a  chemical  kinetics  mecha- 
nism for 2-methyl-1-butanol using existing mechanisms for alco- 
hols. Subsequently, Park et al. [555] utilized rate rules for reaction 
classes and expanded the Sarathy et al. [483] mechanism for iso - 
pentanol by adding ∼100 species and approximately 400 reactions 
speciﬁc to  2-methyl-1-butanol. Rate  parameters for  several reac- 
tions were adjusted within uncertainty bounds to improve predic- 
tions of ignition delay times and species proﬁles. 

De Bruycker et al. [530] employed automatic mechanism gener- 
ation using Genesys [401] to produce a detailed chemical kinetics 
mechanism for prenol and iso -prenol oxidation. Optimized geome- 
tries and thermochemistry were calculated for initial radicals and 
peroxy  radicals  using  CBS-QB3.  Rate  parameters  were  calculated 
from  transition  state  theory  using  the  CBS-QB3-optimized  struc- 
tures for several types of reactions involving the unsaturated al- 
3 ,  ˙ O H-addition to C = C bonds, 
cohols, including H-abstraction by  ˙CH 
and HOO-elimination from  ˙ Q OOH, among others. 

Cai  et  al.  [548]  used  conventional  hierarchical  approaches  of 
mechanisms for 1-butanol [511] and 1-pentanol [ 437 , 483 ] to de- 
velop a mechanism for 1-octanol oxidation, incorporating a total 
of  30  reaction  classes.  To  properly  account  for  the  chemistry  of 
the  larger  alkyl  substituent  group,  the  C6-C8  alkane/alkene  sub- 

25 

mechanism from Westbrook and Dryer [375] was adopted. Simi- 
lar to other alcohols, Waddington reaction and water-elimination 
pathways were included based on the results from Welz et al. [ 296 , 
301 ]. 

Duan et al. [505] revised the 1-pentanol mechanism of Heufer 
et al. [437] by replacing rate-rules-based Arrhenius parameters for 
reactions  of  collisionally  stabilized  α-RO ˙ O  with  rate  parameters 
from coupled cluster calculations. Rates for seven reactions were 
calculated – ﬁve α-RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization reactions and two 
HOO-elimination reactions. Three of the reactions were excluded 
in the initial mechanism, including α-RO ˙ O → pentanal + HO ˙ O . Igni- 
tion delay times were calculated with the revised mechanism and 
were higher by ∼50 – 70% below 775 K. Because of the signiﬁ- 
cance of pentanal in the oxidation of the α radical (pentan-1-ol-1- 
yl), yields were quantiﬁed to determine the fraction formed from 
stabilized RO ˙ O versus  from  ˙ R + O 
2  via  chemical  activation  (well- 
skipping mechanism). Using ChemKin simulations under PSR con- 
ditions  at  1  atm  and  10  atm,  the  well-skipping  mechanism  ac- 
counted for the majority of pentanal. However, the revised mech- 
2 → RO ˙ O , 
anism showed sensitivity to the rate coeﬃcient for  ˙ R + O 
which  in  the  initial  mechanism  [437]  is  that  of  butyl + O 
2  mea- 
sured in Lenhardt et al. [591] . 

Cai  et  al.  [549]  developed  the  ﬁrst  chemical  kinetics  mech- 
anism  for  cyclopentanol.  The  approach  involved  a  detailed  sub- 
mechanism for cyclopentanol-related species, produced using a se- 
ries of quantum chemical calculations of thermochemistry, poten- 
2 with all three initial carbon- 
tial energy surfaces for reactions of O 
centered radicals ( α, β, γ ), and rate coeﬃcients relevant to low- 
temperature chemistry. Sub-mechanisms for intermediates such as 
cyclopentenol isomers were also developed. 

2 -addition reactions ( ˙ Q OOH + O 

To compare chemical kinetics mechanism predictions of alkane 
and  alcohol  oxidation,  simulations  of  mole  fractions  were  con- 
ducted for the present review using the PSR module in ChemKin 
for stoichiometric n -butane and 1-butanol at 10 atm under isother- 
mal conditions at a residence time of 20 0 0 ms using the mech- 
anisms of Healy et al. [96] and Sarathy et al. [511] , respectively. 
Initial concentrations of both species were 10 0 0 ppm. Figure 27 a 
compares the temperature dependence of n -butane and 1-butanol 
consumption. Low-temperature chain-branching and NTC behavior 
is evident for n -butane, starting around 600 K, which is due to a 
2 ) form- 
shift away from second-O 
ing ketohydroperoxides. Because of the pathways speciﬁc to alco- 
hols (cf. Figure 14 ) such reactions are suppressed, which inhibits 
chain-branching and subsequent two-stage ignition for 1-butanol. 
Figure  27 b  compares  species  proﬁles  of  cyclic  ether  species,  2- 
methyloxetane  and  2-oxetanylmethanol,  and  alkene  species,  2- 
butene  and  but-2-en-1-ol,  which  are  formed  from  n -butane  and 
1-butanol, respectively. Cyclic ether speciation measurements from 
alkanes, such as n -butane [592-595] , are relatively common. How- 
ever,  while  some  ˙ Q OOH  decomposition  products  are  reported  in 
alcohol oxidation, namely alkenes and β-scission products [296] , 
cyclic ethers are not. Because concentrations are similar to HOO- 
elimination products, such as the alkenes in Figure 27 c, and be- 
cause of the unique connection to ephemeral  ˙ Q OOH radicals, spe- 
ciation of cyclic ethers is critical to improving the understanding 
of low-temperature oxidation of alcohols. 

3.1.5. Summary of –OH functional group effects 

The  –OH  functional  group  affects  branching  fractions  of  ini- 
tial  alcohol  radicals  due  to  the  5  – 6  kcal/mol  lower  C–H  bond 
energy  on  α carbon  and  to  the  formation  of  pre-reaction  com- 
plexes for both  ˙ O H- and HO ˙ O -initiated abstraction. Due to a lack 
of hydrogen bonding with the –OH group, no pre-reaction com- 
plexes form in abstraction reactions by  ˙CH 
3 . For all alcohols, mea- 
surements of rate coeﬃcients for H-abstraction are absent in the 
400 – 900 K range. Figure 28 shows the low-temperature chain-

the formation of cyclic ether and alkene species occurs in distinct regions of temperature.

used as a guide. The alkane oxidation mechanism is depicted in the back plane for reference. Pathways that are enhanced by the effects of the functional group are 
emphasized with bold arrows and labels, and those that are diminished are made lighter or omitted. The leftward-pointing and downward-pointing arrows indicate a shift 
in ﬂux away from chain-branching pathways responsible for ignition. The initial radical production in alcohols tends to favor α-hydroxyalkyl radicals, which react with O 2 
to form HO ˙ O , inhibiting chain reaction. Reactions of other ( β, γ , δ-hydroxy) radicals with O 2 show increased or new chain-propagation channels that can reduce the ﬂux 
towards chain branching.

branching scheme augmented to emphasize pathways that dimin- 
ish chain-branching and that are enhanced by the presence of the 
–OH functional group in linear and branched alcohols. 

For abstraction by  ˙ O H, ethanol and 1-butanol are the only two 
for which multiple rate coeﬃcients studies are available. Total k (T) 
for  ethanol + ˙ O H  is  consistent  among  the  calculations  [ 436 ,  445 , 
446 ].  However,  while  branching  fractions  all  favor α radical  for- 
mation from 500 – 1000 K in the high-pressure limit, and negli- 
gible abstraction of hydroxylic H, predictions of branching towards 
β radicals are in disagreement. Similarly, rate coeﬃcients calcula- 
tions [ 433 , 434 , 450 ] for  ˙ O H-initiated abstraction from 1-butanol 
are largely consistent with one another – overlapping within 20% 
at 10 0 0 K and within a factor of ∼3 at 500 K. Although branching 
fractions from the three quantum chemical studies for 1-butanol 
show disparities, consistent trends emerge. Branching towards α
radicals  is  favored  ( ∼50  – 70%  at  500  K  and  35  – 55%  at  10 0 0 
K)  and  γ radicals  are  favored  second.  From  the  calculations  of 
Seal  et  al.  [434]  and  the  analytical  equations  of  McGillen  et  al. 
[450] , branching fractions towards β and γ radicals were similar, 
while Zhou et al. [433] predict larger branching towards γ over 
β radicals. In addition, δ radicals were favored over β radicals in 
[433] due to the inclusion of a pre-reaction complex not consid- 
ered in other studies. 

Abstraction  by  HO ˙ O  also  favors  the  formation  of  α radicals, 
which account for > 95% of the branching fraction for ethanol over 
the  range  of  temperatures  relevant  to  low-temperature  combus- 
tion. In 1-butanol, α radicals account for 99% of the radical pool at 
500 K and ∼75% at 1000 K. β, γ , and δ radicals of 1-butanol are 
competitive with one another starting near 900 K. HO ˙ O -initiated 
H-abstraction from iso -pentanol also favors α radicals, although δ
radical formation is signiﬁcant owing to the six hydrogen atoms 
on the two methyl groups. Combined, α and δ account for ∼90% 
of initial radical pool in iso -pentanol, with α favored below 700 K. 
The propensity of alcohols – from ethanol to butanol isomers –
to form a majority of α radicals in the initiation step is one of the 
primary reasons for the lack of low-temperature chain-branching, 
which is reﬂected in both experiments and chemical kinetics mod- 
eling [ 4 83 , 4 84 , 529 ]. The lack of stabilization of chemically acti- 
vated α-RO ˙ O radicals, as shown in hydroxyethyl + O 
2 [497] , which 
is weakly dependent on both pressure [497-500] and temperature 
[500] , and relatively low barrier heights for aldehyde + HO ˙ O chan- 
nels,  both  inhibit  the  production  of  ˙ Q OOH  required  for  ketohy- 
droperoxide formation. Reactions of radicals other than α, such as 
β, γ , and δ radicals, including the Waddington mechanism and the 
water-elimination mechanism proposed by Welz et al. [301] , de- 
plete  ˙ Q OOH radicals and prevents second-O 
2 -addition reactions as 
a result. 

Li et al. [509] conducted quantum chemical calculations to pro- 
duce  pressure-dependent  rate  coeﬃcients  for  Waddington  path- 
ways  and  thermochemical  properties  for  the  species  involved, 
which  were  derived  from  isomers  of  butene  (1-butene,  trans -2- 
butene, and iso -butene) and of butanol (1-butanol and 2-butanol). 
The revised parameters were incorporated into a chemical kinet- 
ics mechanism and showed, consistent with inhibited second-O 
2 - 
addition,  that  ignition  delay  times  increased  by  a  factor  of  ∼2 
for  trans -2-butene  and  iso -butene.  The  effects  on  1-butene  igni- 
tion times were marginal. Water-elimination pathways follow ei- 
ther chain-propagating or chain-inhibiting pathways. For example, 
2-oxybutanal formed via water-elimination from 1-hydroxybutyl- 
2-peroxy  (i.e.  β-RO ˙ O ),  decomposes  in  a  chain-propagating  step 
to  propanal + H ˙CO  [296] .  Alternatively,  upon  reaction  with  O 
2 , 
2-oxybutanal yields 1,2-butadione + HO ˙ O . Water-elimination path- 
ways involving δ-RO ˙ O – in which the peroxy group is on the termi- 
nal carbon and separated form –OH group by four carbon units –
are possible [296] . The extent to which such pathways are relevant 
beyond δ carbon, however, remains unclear although are likely to

ethers in n -butane and 1-butanol. Similar effects occur in other cyclic ether path- 
ways. The formation of cyclic ethers is facilitated in alcohol oxidation when α car- 
bon is involved due to lower barriers to RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization and  ˙ Q OOH de- 
composition. Stationary point energies for the n -butane system are from Eskola et 
al. [595] and for 1-butanol from Welz et al. [296] .

channels, 
˙ Q OOH → cyclic ether + ˙ O H, also contribute to diminished second- 
2 -addition reactions given that the barrier heights to both RO ˙ O 
O 
isomerization and  ˙ Q OOH decomposition are lowered when involv- 
ing α carbon  (where  the  –OH  is  bound).  As  an  example,  Figure 
29  compares  analogous  pathways  yielding  5-membered  cyclic 
ether species: 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran. The 
barrier height for the 7-membered transition state from δ-RO ˙ O to 
1-hydroperoxy-butanol-1-yl is 18.6 kcal/mol [296] . The analogous 
channel in n -butane via 1-hydroperoxy-butan-4-yl is 23.5 kcal/mol 
[595] .  The  alcohol  channel  is  lower  by  ∼5  kcal/mol.  Similarly, 
unimolecular  decomposition  of  ˙ Q OOH  into  cyclic  ether  is  lower 
in  the  alcohol  case  by  3  kcal/mol.  Other  cyclic  ether  channels 
involving α carbon reﬂect similar behavior. However, because no 
isomer-resolved  speciation  measurements  of  key  species  from 
unimolecular  ˙ Q OOH  decomposition  are  reported  for  1-butanol, 
chemical kinetics modeling is unable to determine the quantitative 
impact, i.e. the ﬂux of  ˙ Q OOH radicals from 1-butanol proceeding 
via unimolecular decomposition versus second-O 

2 -addition. 

Ignition delay time measurements below 10 0 0 K are reported 
for several alcohols ( Section 3.1.4.1 ): ethanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 
iso -butanol, tert -butanol, as well as pentanol isomers (1-pentanol, 
2-pentanol,  iso -pentanol,  and  cyclopentanol).  In  contrast  to  n - 
alkanes, for which propane is the smallest species to exhibit two- 
stage ignition [ 533 , 537 ], the smallest alcohol that undergoes low- 
temperature chain-branching is 1-pentanol [98] . Others include 1- 
hexanol [98] and 1-octanol [548] . In general, as alkyl substituents 
become  longer,  the  inﬂuence  of  the  –OH  group  is  diminished  –
i.e. ignition delay times of 1-octanol are more similar to n -octane 
than  1-butanol  to  n -butane.  However,  because  temperatures  and 
pressures overlap in only a limited number of cases, between alco- 
hols and alkanes and among alcohols, comparison of the inﬂuence 
of  molecular  structure  on  ignition  is  diﬃcult.  Accordingly,  addi- 
tional experiments are needed at identical conditions for both lin- 
ear, branched, and cyclic alcohols to directly examine the effect of 
the –OH functional group relative to similar-sized alkane analogs, 
similar to the approach of Heufer et al. [98] . 

3.2. Esters 

Ester functional groups deﬁne the molecular structure of con- 
ventional  biodiesel,  which  is  a  mixture  of  long-chain  methyl  or 
ethyl  esters,  the  composition  of  which  depends  on  the  type  of 
biomass-derived oil used in transesteriﬁcation [596-598] , e.g. soy 
[599] , rapeseed [599] , or algae [600] . While the speciﬁc amounts

type (x:y) is used for methyl esters to designate the size of the 
alkyl chain (x) and the degree of unsaturation (y). Examples in- 
clude (16:0), which represents methyl palmitate, (18:1) for methyl 
oleate, and (18:2) for methyl linoleate.

In a similar vein to the hierarchical approach adopted for chem- 
ical kinetics mechanisms of hydrocarbons [ 375 , 385 ], in which the 
2 /CO  system  serves  as  base  chemistry  and  elementary  re- 
H 
actions  for  larger  species  are  added  subsequently,  the  oxidation 
chemistry of small esters contributes to the foundation of mech- 
anisms for larger esters relevant to practical biodiesel. Because of 
variation in both the size of the alkyl substituent and in the degree 
of unsaturation, smaller esters are employed in studies as surro- 
gates to understand the role of the functional group on combus- 
tion. As a result, numerous studies exist on methyl esters up to 
methyl decanoate. Methyl butanoate oxidation is the most studied 
[602-617] and a smaller collection of work examines the role of 
unsaturated carbon on reaction mechanisms below 10 0 0 K [ 618 , 
619 ]. 

Figure  30  shows  the  molecular  structure  of  several  esters: 
methyl butanoate, methyl- trans -3-hexenoate, and methyl linoleate. 
The ester functional group creates distinct abstraction sites along 
the  alkyl  chain  (e.g.  α’ ,  β’ ,  γ ’ )  and  on  the  methoxy  group  ( α), 
where the prime notation indicates carbon sites on the alkyl side 
of the ester, consistent with Mendes et al. [ 620 , 621 ]. While analo- 
gies with n -alkane chemistry are drawn for larger alkyl chains in 
esters  [622-624] ,  understanding  the  role  of  resonance  stabilized 
radicals produced from abstraction at the α’ site [ 377 , 619 , 625 ] 
and the role of C = C bonds on low-temperature oxidation [ 609 , 619 , 
626 , 627 ] are critical to understanding ester oxidation. 

Quantum  chemical  calculations  of  thermochemical  properties 
of esters include bond energies, entropy, enthalpies of formation, 
and speciﬁc heats [ 603 , 628-639 ]. Osmont et al. [628] developed 
a  protocol  for  determining  gas-phase  thermochemical  properties 
of methyl and ethyl esters at the B3LYP/6-31G( d , p ) level and con- 
ducted an extensive series of calculations on standard enthalpies 
of  formation,  speciﬁc  heats,  and  entropies  for  dozens  of  esters 
and  radicals  of  esters  [635] .  The  protocol  employed  atomic  cor- 
rections,  which  were  determined  via  least-squares  ﬁtting  of  ex- 
perimental  standard  enthalpies  of  formation,  to  augment  elec- 
tronic  and  zero-point  energies  and  thermal  corrections.  Subse- 
quently, the approach was extended to calculations of C–O, (C = O)–
O,  and  (C = O)–C  bond  energies  in  methyl  esters  [629]  and  to 
thermochemical  properties  of  oxygenated  radicals  from  methyl 
esters [630] . 

The ester functional group and unsaturated carbon in the alkyl 
side chain creates changes in C–C and C–H bond energies, includ- 
ing allylic and bis -allylic, which are lower in energy than alkylic 
sites and vinylic sites [635] . Because of the large molecular size of 
esters in practical biodiesel and related surrogates, high-level ab 
initio calculations are expensive. In addition to group additivity es-

gies (kcal/mol) calculated at the M08-HX/ma-TZVP level of theory [634] . 

timates [640] , several studies on bond energy calculations of esters 
exist [ 222 , 602 , 631-634 , 641 ]. 

To  mitigate  the  computational  expense  for  biodiesel-relevant 
esters, Oyeyemi et al. [632] calculated bond energies for C1 – C4 
species, including methyl butanoate and methyl- trans -2-butenoate, 
using  a  composite,  multireference-averaged  coupled-pair  func- 
tional  (MRACPF2)-based  scheme  developed  previously  for  hydro- 
carbons [642] , and used structure-activity considerations to extend 
the  results  to  larger  esters  that  could  not  be  calculated  at  that 
level. Accounting for differences in multireference character, sev- 
eral complete active space (CAS) methods were applied depending 
on the molecular structure and the type of bond-scission step. As 
an example, CAS(4e, 4o) was utilized for C–H bond-scission of al- 
lylic hydrogen on α’ carbon (cf. Figure 30 ) to account for electrons 
in π / π ∗ orbitals in the C = O bond and electrons in σ / σ ∗ orbitals 
of the dissociating C–H bond. Bond energies for C–H, C–O, and C–
C were computed using MRACPF2 for C1 – C4 methyl and ethyl 
esters,  several  alkanes,  alkenes,  and  a  representative  diene  (1,4- 
pentadiene), which act as surrogates for the molecular structure 
motifs in biodiesel-relevant esters. Results from the smaller, rep- 
resentative  molecules  were  mapped  onto  methyl  stearate  (16:0), 
methyl oleate (18:1), methyl linoleate (18:2), and methyl linolenate 
(18:3) by assuming that the bond energies in sections of the es- 
ters were similar to bond energies in the surrogate species. Sub- 
sequently,  Oyeyemi  et  al.  [633]  modiﬁed  the  multireference  ap- 
proach using a reduced scaling method to directly calculate bond 
energies of large esters, from methyl decanoate to methyl octade- 
canoate, and including saturated and unsaturated species. The re- 
sults were largely similar to the sectional approach in [632] with 
the  most  substantial  difference  occurring  at  the  bis -allylic  site. 
The reduced-scaling method produced a C–H bond energy of 78.9 
kcal/mol – higher by 2.8 kcal/mol than the earlier estimate using 
1,4-pentadiene as a surrogate. 

Li  et  al.  [634]  utilized  Kohn-Sham  exchange-correlation  func- 
tionals [643] and coupled cluster theory with extrapolation to the 
complete basis set (CBS) limit to conduct a series of direct calcu- 
lations on methyl linolenate. Using the M08-HX density functional 
and a minimally augmented basis set with valence triple-zeta po- 
larization  (M08-HX/ma-TZVP),  C–H  bond  energies  on  the α’  car- 
bon  (91.9  kcal/mol)  were  similar  to  calculations  using  MRACPF2 
[632] and several kcal/mol lower than CBS-QB3 [ 614 , 631 ]. Figure 
31  shows  C–H  bond  energies  calculated  using  M08-HX/ma-TZVP 
[634] . The lowest bond energy, due to the higher number of elec- 
trons involved in resonance-stabilization compared to allylic rad-

icals, is on the two bis -allylic sites, followed by allylic C–H (82.4 
kcal/mol and 83.1 kcal/mol). Both allylic sites are similar to anal- 
ogous bond energies in alkenes [60] . Notably, however, the bond 
energies of the two bis -allylic sites differ by several kcal/mol. On 
the  site  closest  to  the  terminal  carbon  on  the  alkyl  chain,  the 
C–H  bond  energy  is  78.2  kcal/mol,  while  on  the  bis -allylic  site 
closer  to  the  ester  group,  the  bond  energy  is  6  kcal/mol  lower 
(72.1 kcal/mol). The substantial difference indicates that the nearby 
bonding environment, as well as structural relaxation in the radi- 
cals produced, affects bond strengths. Conformer-dependent calcu- 
lations were not conducted in Li et al. [634] . However, Oyeyemi 
et al. [632] calculated the sensitivity of bond energies to confor- 
mational changes in methyl butanoate and reported no signiﬁcant 
dependence. 

The  sections  below  discuss  initiation  reactions  with  ˙ O H  and 
HO ˙ O  and  resulting  branching  fractions,  mechanistic  studies  of 
methyl  ester  radicals  with  O 
2 ,  reactions  of  initial  ester  radicals 
2 , speciation from thermally initiated experiments, detailed 
with O 
kinetics  modeling,  and  autoignition  measurements  using  shock 
tubes and rapid compression machines. Due to broad coverage of 
a disparate number of esters, the sections are organized around a 
particular aspect of low-temperature oxidation, such as peroxy rad- 
ical reactions, within which ester-speciﬁc chemistry is discussed. A 
summary on the impact of the ester moiety on low-temperature 
oxidation is then provided. 

3.2.1. Initiation reactions and branching fractions 

Rate coeﬃcients were reported for reactions of esters with  ˙ O H 
[ 620 , 627 , 644-654 ], HO ˙ O [ 621 , 645 , 646 , 655-657 ], and  ˙CH 
3 radi- 
cals [ 6 45 , 6 46 , 658 , 659 ]. Studies are also reported for abstraction 
reactions by other radicals relevant at high-temperature, including 
˙ H [ 6 45 , 6 46 , 6 48 , 6 60 , 6 61 ] and Ö [ 6 45 , 6 46 , 6 48 ]. Experiments 
at temperatures near 300 K suggest that hydrogen-bonded com- 
plexes could  be important in  ˙ O H reactions with esters. Walling- 
ton et al. [644] conducted ﬂash photolysis/resonance ﬂuorescence 
measurements  of  rate  coeﬃcient  for  a  series  for  ˙ O H + esters  at 
296 K to independently examine the effects of size and structure 
of both the alkyl chain and the alkoxy group (up to four carbon 
atoms in both cases). An unusual increase in the rate coeﬃcient 
when the size of either chain increased from three to four carbon 
atoms was ascribed to the formation of a hydrogen-bonded pre- 
reaction complex, similar to prior work by Wallington and Kurylo 
[662]  on  ketones.  Wallington  et  al.  [644]  found  a  weak  positive 
temperature dependence for the reactions of  ˙ O H with methyl ac- 
etate and ethyl acetate from 296 – 440 K. The experiments by El 
Boudali et al. [649] and Le Calvé et al. [ 650 , 652 ] from 233 – 372 
K  expanded  rate  coeﬃcient  measurements  of  ˙ O H + esters  to  in- 
clude methyl pentanoate and methyl hexanoate and found negative 
temperature  dependence  in  the  rate  coeﬃcents  for  esters  larger 
than methyl butanoate and for acetates larger than methyl acetate 
[652] up to ∼400 K [649] . 

The sections below provide a review of ester reactions with  ˙ O H 
and HO ˙ O , which involve the formation of pre-reaction complexes 
in both cases, and are separated according to molecular size, i.e. 
methyl formate up to C6 methyl esters. 

Tan  et  al.  [645]  conducted  ab  initio  quantum  calculations  of 
H-abstraction from methyl formate by  ˙ O H using a multireference 
correlated  wave  function  method  (CBS-MRSDCI),  which  included 
size-extensivity corrections to calculate barrier heights and reac- 
tion  enthalpies.  High-pressure-limit  rate  coeﬃcients  were  calcu- 
lated from 300 – 1500 K using canonical transition state theory 
with separable-hindered-rotor approximation for torsions and the 
harmonic oscillator approximation for other vibrational modes.

For  abstraction  from  the  methoxy  group,  optimized  reactant  ge- 
ometries and transition states revealed in-plane and out-of-plane 
abstractions,  the  latter  involving  a  strong  hydrogen-bonding  in- 
teraction between the H atom in the  ˙ O H radical and the O atom 
in  the  carbonyl  group.  Similar,  stabilizing  pre-reaction  bonding 
occurred  in  the  transition  state  for  abstraction  from  the  methyl 
group. Rate coeﬃcients and branching fractions were calculated up 
to 500 K by canonical TST; under these conditions, out-of-plane 
abstraction from the methoxy group dominates (96% at ∼ 298 K), 
in agreement with Wallington et al. [644] . 

Using  coupled  cluster  (CCSD(T))  and  multireference-averaged 
coupled  pair  functional  theory  (MRACPF2),  Tan  et  al.  [648]  cal- 
culated abstraction reactions for methyl acetate with several co- 
reactants, which revealed pre-reaction complex formation for  ˙ O H 
and  HO ˙ O .  Nearly  identical  rate  coeﬃcients  were  predicted  us- 
ing  both  conventional  TST  over  a  single  transition  state  and  a 
complex-mediated  mechanism  that  used  VRC-TST  for  the  bar- 
rierless  entrance  channel.  Mendes  et  al.  [620]  carried  out  a 
systematic  study  of  hydrogen  atom  abstraction  by  ˙ O H  radicals 
on  esters  (methyl  acetate,  methyl  propanoate,  methyl  butanoate, 
methyl  isobutyrate,  ethyl  ethanoate,  propyl  ethanoate,  and  iso- 
propyl ethanoate), using conventional transition state theory with 
asymmetric  Eckart  tunneling  corrections,  using  structures  opti- 
mized  at  the  MP2/6-311G( d , p )  level  and  G3  energy  calculations. 
Energies for methyl acetate were also computed using a higher- 
level  method,  CCSD(T)/CBS.  The  high-pressure  limit  rate  coeﬃ- 
cients  in  Mendes  et  al.  [620]  for  temperatures  between  500  K 
and  2200  K  are  in  reasonable  agreement  with  those  in  Tan  et 
al. [648] , and both agree with Jørgensen et al. [651] that abstrac- 
tion at the methoxy site dominates at low temperature. Mendes 
et al. [620] predict that methyl and methoxy abstractions become 
equal at about 10 0 0 K, but Tan et al. [648] show a preference for 
methoxy abstraction. 

Site-speciﬁc  rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction  from  methyl 
propanoate by  ˙ O H were calculated using VariFlex [468] in Mendes 
et al. [620] and Tan et al. [646] . Mendes et al. [620] employed con- 
ventional transition state theory with asymmetric Eckart tunneling 
corrections, using energies computed at the MP2/6-311G( d , p ) level. 
Tan et al. [646] utilized several variations of transition state the- 
ory and the multi-structure all-structure (MS-AS) approach, with 
both multi-reference methods (MRSDCI) and coupled cluster meth- 
ods, CCSD(T). Energies of reactant complexes, transition states, and 
products  in  Tan  et  al.  [646]  were  consistent  with  Mendes  et  al. 
[620] , and the total rate coeﬃcients produced from the two meth- 
ods were within 20% at 500 K and within 10% at 10 0 0 K ( Figure 
32 a). As in the case of methyl acetate, the branching ratio predic- 
tions differ somewhat ( Figure 32 b, c). The site-speciﬁc rate coef- 
ﬁcients from Mendes et al. [620] are weakly dependent on tem- 
perature from 50 0 – 10 0 0 K and α’ radicals are dominant. Tan et 
al. [646] show a moderate temperature dependence and a differ- 
ent  ordering  for  the  β’  and  α’  channels.  Based  on  results  from 
6 + ˙CN, Mendes et al.  [620] em- 
Georgievskii et  al. [663] for C 
2 H 
ployed a single-transition-state model – neglecting the outer tran- 
sition state involved in the pre-reaction complex. In contrast, Tan 
et al. [646] applied a two-transition-state model using variable re- 
action coordinate transition state theory (VRC-TST) for the barrier- 
less complex formation. The effect of the reaction complex is larger 
at lower temperatures. 

Mendes et al. [620] also calculated rate coeﬃcients and branch- 
ing  fractions  for  reactions  with  methyl  butanoate,  methyl  iso - 
propanoate, ethyl acetate, n -propyl acetate, and iso -propyl acetate, 
to  systematically  examine  the  role  of  alkyl  substituent  size  and 
structure in the formation of a pre-reaction complex ( Figure 33 ). 
In the comparison of branching fractions calculated for the esters, 
k (T) primarily depended on the ability of  ˙ O H to form a pre-reaction 
complex and secondarily on the type of C–H bond. For example, in

methyl butanoate, the C–H bond energy on α’ is ∼4 – 5 kcal/mol 
lower than on β’ [634] , yet up to ∼800 K, branching towards β’ 
radicals  dominates  due  to  interaction  of  ˙ O H  with  with  carbonyl 
group ( Figure 34 ). 

Pre-reaction  complexes  were  formed  in  abstraction  reactions 
from four sites among the seven esters studied, α, α’ , β, and β’ , 
which were stabilized by 3.6 – 5.6 kcal/mol depending on the type 
of C–H bond and the spatial orientation of the abstraction site rel- 

30 

ative to the ester functional group. Product complexes were also 
formed in all four cases. The impact of excluding both pre-reaction 
and  product  complexes  on  rate  coeﬃcients  was  examined  for  a 
representative case: abstraction from α’ carbon in  ˙ O H + methyl ac- 
etate reactions. At 500 K, neglecting complex-mediated steps low- 
ered the total rate coeﬃcient by 70% and to a lesser extent at 10 0 0 
K,  changing  only  by  ∼10%  [620] .  However,  while  the  impact  on 
total  rate  coeﬃcient  is  within  typical  uncertainty  bounds,  inclu- 
sion of the transition state for pre-reaction complexes may affect 
branching fractions as suggested in Figure 32 . 

Rate coeﬃcients for reactions of  ˙ O H with four esters (methyl 
formate, methyl acetate, methyl propanoate, and methyl butanoate) 
were measured in Lam et al. [647] using absorption spectroscopy 
behind  reﬂected  shock  waves.  The  rates  were  measured  via  ex- 
ponential  decay  ﬁtting  of  ˙ O H  radical  time  proﬁles  at  ∼1.5  atm 
and from ∼875 – 1370 K and were compared to simulations us- 
ing  detailed  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  of  Dooley  et  al.  for 
methyl formate/methyl acetate [641] and methyl butanoate [614] . 
For  methyl  propanoate,  rate  coeﬃcients  were  adopted  from  the 
ethyl propanoate mechanism of Metcalfe et al. [613] and incorpo- 
rated into the Dooley et al. [614] mechanism for methyl butanoate. 
Figure  35  compares  the  Lam  et  al.  [647]  measurements  with 
others  obtained  above  300  K  [ 6 44 ,  6 49 ,  650 ,  652 ],  and  with  ab 
initio calculations of Mendes et al. [620] and Tan et al. [646] . Dis- 
crepancies with the calculations for methyl formate + ˙ O H from Tan 
et al. [645] were noted, differing by a factor of ∼5 at 850 K ( Figure 
35 a). However, the calculations for methyl acetate and methyl bu- 
tanoate  from  Tan  et  al.  [ 6 46 ,  6 48 ]  are  within  experimental  un- 
certainty  over  the  entire  range  of  temperature  ( Figure  35 b  and 
c). Similarly, the rate calculations are consistent with Mendes et 
al.  [620]  to  within  a  factor  of  ∼2.3  at  20 0 0  K  and  ∼1.5  at  500 
K. Note that 500 K was the lower limit of temperature in [620] , 
whereas Tan et al. [ 6 46 , 6 48 ] extended calculations to 250 K. Sim-

Shang  et  al.  [654]  utilized  CCSD(T)  methods  to  calculate 
rate  coeﬃcients  and  branching  ratios  for  ˙ O H + methyl  pen- 
tanoate → H 
2 O + ˙ R  in  the  high-pressure  limit  from  200  – 20 0 0 
K. Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were con- 
ducted using M06-2X/cc-pVTZ. Pre-reaction complex formation oc- 
curred  in  abstraction  reactions  with  all  carbon  atoms  on  alkyl 
change.  Branching  fractions  from  500  – 10 0 0  K  are  competitive 
among α, γ , and β sites, accounting for 75 – 85%. Abstraction from 
δ carbon accounted for ∼10% at 10 0 0 K and ∼5% at 500 K and was 
negligible from the methoxy site. 

Wang and Ni [627] used CBS-QB3 methods and calculated high- 
pressure limit rate coeﬃcients for  ˙ O H-initiated H-abstraction from 
methyl pentanoate and ﬁve additional C6 methyl esters using con- 
ventional TST over a single transition state. The effect of the C = C 
bond  position  relative  to  the  ester  moiety  was  examined  using 
methyl pentenoate isomers and two branched species were stud- 
ied: methyl 2-methylbutanaote and methyl 2-methylbut-3-enoate. 
Similar  to  previous  studies  on  H-abstraction,  pre-reaction  com- 
plexes  were  identiﬁed  between  ˙ O H  and  the  ester  moiety  at  all 
sites  except  the  terminal  ( δ)  carbon  due  to  weaker  interactions 
at  longer  distance.  Branching  ratios  in  Wang  and  Ni  [627]  re- 
veal  that,  in  four  of  the  six  cases  and  regardless  of  C–H  bond 
type (secondary, allylic, or vinylic), abstraction from β(cid:9)  is a ma- 
jor  channel.  Similar  results  are  reﬂected  in  the  calculations  of 
Mendes  et  al.  [620]  for  saturated  methyl  esters.  Two  exceptions 
in  [627]  were  reactions  with  unsaturated  esters:  ˙ O H + methyl-4- 
pentenoate and  ˙ O H + methyl 2-methylbut-3-enoate. In the former 
reaction, despite stronger C–H bond energy, abstraction at the two 
vinylic sites accounted for ∼50% at 600 K and ∼65% at 10 0 0 K. 
In the latter,  ˙ O H + methyl 2-methylbut-3-enoate, abstraction of pri- 
mary hydrogen from the methyl group adjacent to the ester moi- 
ety  and  the  lone  tertiary  hydrogen  were  the  dominant  abstrac- 
tion sites. In both cases, abstraction of vinylic hydrogen from γ (cid:9) 
and  δ(cid:9)  carbon  become  the  dominant  channels  towards  10 0 0  K.

hydrogen abstraction (right) in reactions of hydroperoxyl with methyl acetate in

Collectively,  the  site-speciﬁc  abstraction  comparisons  of  the  C6 
methyl  esters  in  Wang  and  Ni  [627]  indicate  that  bond  ener- 
gies are not suﬃcient to predict branching fractions in reactions 
with  ˙ O H. 

Rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction  by  HO ˙ O  are  reported 
for  methyl  formate  [645] ,  methyl  acetate  [ 621 ,  648 ],  methyl 
propanoate  [ 621 ,  646 ],  and  methyl  butanoate  [ 621 ,  657 ].  In  ad- 
dition,  Mendes  et  al.  [621]  computed  k (T)  for  C5  methyl  esters 
(methyl  pentanoate  and  methyl  iso-butanoate)  and  several  ac- 
etate  species  (ethyl  acetate,  n -propyl  acetate,  and  iso -propyl  ac- 
etate). Kopp et al. [655] calculated rate coeﬃcients for n -butyl for- 
mate, where, similar to reactions with OH, pre-reaction and prod- 
uct complexes were formed. Figure 36 shows two examples from 
Mendes et al. [621] for HO ˙ O + methyl acetate. 

CCSD(T)  and  multireference-averaged  coupled  pair  functional 
theory  (MRACPF2)  were  utilized  in  Tan  et  al.  [648]  to  calcu- 
late high-pressure limit rate coeﬃcients for HO ˙ O + methyl acetate. 
Transition  states  for  abstraction  at  both α and α(cid:9)  sites  involved 
pre-reaction complex formation due to interactions with the oxy- 
gen atom in carbonyl group. Branching ratios for the two abstrac- 
tion channels involving HO ˙ O were only moderately dependent on 
temperature. At 500 K, ∼85% of abstraction occurred at the alkoxy 
group (i.e. α carbon) and ∼15% from the methyl group (i.e. α’ car- 
bon). At 10 0 0 K, abstraction from α carbon was ∼78% and ∼22% 
from α’ carbon.  Using CCSD(T) without MRACPF2,  Mendes et al.

sites calculated in Mendes et al. [621] and Tan et al. 

[621]  calculated  similar  total  rate  coeﬃcients,  yet  sharply  differ- 
ent branching ratios: ∼63% from the methyl group and ∼37% from 
the alkoxy group at 500 K, while at 10 0 0 K branching ratios for 
the  two  channels  were  approximately  equal.  One  notable  differ- 
ence  between  the  two  studies  is  the  choice  of  either  a  single- 
or  two-transition-state  model  (to  account  for  complex-mediated 
steps).  Tan  et  al.  [648]  used  a  single  transition  state  in  view  of 
the large barrier ( ∼17 kcal/mol above reactants). Similar energies 
were calculated on the potential energy surfaces in Mendes et al. 
[621] , however, a two-transition-state model was used. For the re- 
actant complex, based on hindrance potential calculations, a ∼2.5 
kcal/mol barrier separated the two optimized transition states for 
in-plane and out-of-plane abstraction (cf. Figure 36 ). The lower of 
the two, in-plane abstraction where a hydrogen bond is formed be- 
tween the hydrogen of the HO ˙ O radical and the oxygen atom of the 
carbonyl, was used as the abstraction transition state for the rate 
coeﬃcient calculations. 

Tan et al. [646] calculated high-pressure limit rate coeﬃcients 
for  abstraction  reactions  of  HO ˙ O  with  methyl  propanoate  us- 
ing  several  methods,  including  canonical-  and  variable-reaction 
coordinate-transition  state  theory  (VRC-TST)  and  multi-structure 
methods. Stationary point energies were calculated at the CCSD(T) 
and MRSDCI levels of theory. In contrast to prior calculations by 
Tan  et  al.  [648]  on  methyl  acetate + HO ˙ O ,  a  two-transition  state 
model was utilized to account for the role of complex formation 
during abstraction, which is important to note given the similarity 
of the rate coeﬃcents (cf. Figure 35 c) and branching ratios ( Figure 
37 ) with Mendes et al. [621] , in which a two-transition-state model 
was also utilized. In both studies, abstraction of hydrogen by HO ˙ O 
occured primarily from α(cid:9) carbon. Similar temperature dependence 
is predicted by both sets of calculations, and the major difference 
is  a  favoring  of  abstraction  from α carbon  over β carbon  using 
the  rate  coeﬃcents  from  Mendes  et  al.  [621]  ( Figure  37 a).  The 
site-speciﬁc rate coeﬃcients calculated in [621] were compared to 
analogous reactions in n -alkanes. For all types of abstraction, rate 
coeﬃcients for HO ˙ O + methyl propanoate were lower than for the 
same type of H-abstraction in n -alkanes. 

The branching ratios in Figure 37 are correlated approximately 
with C–H bond dissociation energy. However, similar to reactions 
with  ˙ O H radicals, abstraction from the β(cid:9)  carbon by HO ˙ O is the 
major branching channel in reactions with larger esters. Figure 38 a 
plots  branching  fractions  calculated  for  HO ˙ O + methyl  butanoate 
from the rate parameters in Mendes et al. [620] . The same trend 
is also reﬂected in the branching ratio calculations of Wang and Ni 
[627] on  ˙ O H + esters. For example, in reactions of  ˙ O H with methyl 
pentanoate, abstraction from β(cid:9) site on the alkyl chain is the main 
channel  below  800  K.  While  C–H  bond  energies  near  the  ester 
moiety  are  lower  than  on  the  alkyl  chain  due  to  hyperconjuga- 
tion,  the  stabilizing  hydrogen  bonding  interaction  facilitates  ab- 

straction from β(cid:9) carbon. Figure 38 b plots branching fractions from 
Meng et al. [657] , which were calculated using transition state the- 
ory  and  accounted  for  anharmonicity  in  low-frequency  torsional 
modes using multistructural methods of Truhlar et al. [ 6 64 , 6 65 ]. 
Stationary  points  were  computed  at  the  QCISD(T)/CBS//B3LYP/6- 
311 ++ G( d , p ) level of theory. Compared with Mendes et al. [620] , 
barrier heights in Meng et al. [657] for abstraction from α(cid:9) and β(cid:9) 
are lower by ∼1 kcal/mol and ∼2 kcal/mol lower for abstraciton 
from  γ (cid:9) ,  while  the  barrier  for  abstraction  from  α is  higher  by 
∼1 kcal/mol. 

Kopp et al. [655] calculated rate coeﬃcients for HO ˙ O + n -butyl 
formate at the B2KPLYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Extensive con- 
formational analysis of the transition states revealed several dis- 
tinct features on the potential energy surface. The lowest energy n - 
butyl formate conformer involves all carbon atoms lying in approx- 
imately the same plane, with an out-of-plane ester moiety ( Figure 
39 ) that enables hydrogen bonding interaction of either of the es- 
ter oxygens with abstracting HO ˙ O at the γ and δ positions. The 
latter position is notable because for abstractions more than three 
carbon atoms away, the functional group is often considered irrel- 
evant. The transition state in Figure 39 is the lowest energy path- 
way for abstraction from the δ carbon; the barrier to hydrogen ab- 
straction from δ carbon was higher by 1.9 kcal/mol when involving 
hydrogen pointing away from the ester group. Barrier heights for 
abstraction depended on the type of hydrogen bonding. For exam- 
ple, a ∼2 kcal/mol difference was noted for δ carbon when HO ˙ O 
interacts with the carbonyl group compared to hydrogen bonding 
with the oxygen atom in the alkoxy group. Abstraction of hydrogen 
in the formate position is dominant ( ∼45%), and, as in abstraction 
reactions with larger esters [ 620 , 627 ], branching towards β radi- 
cals is a major channel ( ∼30%) due to the formation of stabilizing 
pre-reaction complex [655] . 

3.2.2. Reactions of initial radicals with O 2 

Studies focusing on rate coeﬃcients and reaction mechanisms 
of  ester  radicals  with  O 
2  include  methyl  acetate  [639] ,  methyl 
propanoate  [ 605 ,  6 6 6 ],  methyl  butanoate  [602-606] ,  methyl  but- 
2-enoate  [667] ,  methyl  pentanoate  [ 602 ,  605 ],  methyl  octanoate 
[668] , and ethyl butanoate [606] . With the exception of MPIMS ex- 
periments [ 605 , 606 ], the majority are quantum chemical studies 
[ 602-604 , 639 , 6 6 6 , 6 68 ] for which CBS-QB3 is the most common 
level of theory used for electronic structure calculations. 

Mai et al. [639] calculated potential energy surfaces for methyl 
2  at  the  CBS-QB3  level  of  theory.  Sev- 
acetate  radicals  with  O 
eral  ˙ Q OOH  decomposition  channels  were  considered,  including 
cyclic  ether + ˙ O H,  intramolecular  ˙ O H-transfer  (producing  an  OH- 
substituted alkoxy radical), and carbonyl + ˙ O H. Pressure-dependent 
rate coeﬃcients were calculated using QRRK theory. For the ini-

nius  parameters  were  calculated  for  125  reactions  related  to  ˙ R , 
RO ˙ O , and RO ˙ O + HO ˙ O chemistry of methyl butanoate. Rate coeﬃ- 
cients were compared for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH and RO ˙ O → alkene + HO ˙ O 
in methyl butanoate to analogous reactions in alkanes. For isomer- 
ization on the alkyl chain, in exclusion of the ester moiety, rate 
coeﬃcients were within a factor of 2. However, when incorporated 
in the transition state, isomerization rates were lower by ∼10 2 at 
500 K and by ∼10 1 at 750 K. 

Barrier heights for isomeration of methyl butanoate peroxy rad- 
icals in Tao and Lin [603] were similar to the calculations in Hayes 
and  Burgess  [602] .  However,  for  reactions  involving  6-  and  7- 
membered transition states, isomerization rates below 10 0 0 K dif- 
fered by several orders of magnitude and were ascribed to differ- 
ences in pre-exponential factors. Smaller discrepancies with rates 
from the detailed chemical kinetics mechanism of Herbinet et al. 
[670] were also noted. For RO ˙ O + HO ˙ O rate coeﬃcients, which ex- 
hibit only moderate temperature dependence, disparities with the 
detailed  mechanisms  of  Fisher  et  al.  [669]  and  Herbinet  et  al. 
[670] were approximately an order of magnitude. 

Jiao  et  al.  [604]  calculated  potential  energy  surfaces  for 
˙ Q OOH + O 
2 reactions in methyl butanoate at the CBS-QB3 level of 
theory  and  included  cyclic  ether  formation,  in  addition  to  con- 
ventional  ˙ O OQOOH pathways leading to alkoxy + 2  ˙ O H (i.e. chain- 
branching).  From  calculations  of  high-pressure  limit  rate  coeﬃ- 
cients for 27 methyl butanoate  ˙ O OQOOH isomerization reactions, 
Jiao et al. [604] suggested that peroxy radical interconversion rates 
( Figure  41 )  are  potentially  considerable,  even  those  requiring  8- 
membered transition states and larger. 

Muller et al. [605] employed MPIMS with chlorine-initiated ox- 
idation of three methyl esters – propanoate, butanoate, and pen- 
tanoate  – at  550  K  and  650  K  to  examine  product  formation 
and quantify isomer ratios of the various alkenoate species pro- 
duced via HO ˙ O -formation channels. For both methyl butanoate and 
methyl  pentanoate,  C = C  bond  formation  from  HO ˙ O -elimination 
is  strongly  favored  on  the  carbon  closest  to  the  ester  moi- 
ety,  which  is  consistent  with  Tao  and  Lin  [603] .  In  the  for- 
mer,  methyl-2-butenoate  was  the  only  conjugate  alkenoate  pro- 
duced  at  either  temperature,  while  for  methyl  pentanoate  the 
analogous species (methyl-2-pentenoate) was the only isomer at 
550  K.  At  650  K,  the  other  two  isomers  also  contributed,  yet 
methyl-2-pentenoate remained the dominant pathway (isomer ra- 
tio of ∼60%). Potential energy surfaces of peroxy radical decom- 
position  were  calculated  at  the  CBS-QB3  level  of  theory  and  in- 
cluded  select  cyclic  ether + ˙ O H  channels  in  addition  to  conju- 
gate alkene + HO ˙ O channels. Resonance-stabilized  ˙ Q OOH were pro- 
posed  as  the  most  likely  cyclic  ether  formation  pathways.  Ion 
signals  were  detected  at  the  mass-to-charge  ratio  ( m/z )  corre- 
sponding to the cyclic ether co-product of chain-propagating OH-

pete with redissociation to reactants; only for the initial radical on 
the methoxy side is there signiﬁcant isomerization to  ˙ Q OOH. 

Reaction  mechanisms  and  rate  coeﬃcients  were  computed  in 
2 . Potential 
Le et al. [6 6 6] for methyl propanoate radicals with O 
energy  calculations  were  conducted  using  CBS-QB3  for  36  reac- 
tion pathways across the three  ˙ R + O 
2 surfaces. In addition to cyclic 
ether, conjugate alkene, intramolecular  ˙ O H-transfer in  ˙ Q OOH, and 
carbonyl product channels, barrier heights for C–C β-scission and 
keto-enol tautomerization of  ˙ Q OOH were calculated. Arrhenius rate 
parameters  for  rate  coeﬃcients  in  the  high-pressure  limit  were 
calculated using canonical transition state theory. Using a similar 
approach to Mai et al. [639] , pressure-dependent rate coeﬃcients 
were calculated using QRRK theory. Le et al. [6 6 6] compared rate 
coeﬃcients of methyl propanoate radical reactions with analogous 
reactions in alkyl + O 
2 systems [ 408 , 409 ], calculated at the same 
level of theory (CBS-QB3). Two notable differences were revealed 
( Figure 40 ). First, rates of  ˙ Q OOH reverse-isomerization to RO ˙ O via a 
5-membered transition state were ∼10 1 higher at 500 K for ester- 
derived  ˙ Q OOH than for analogous alkyl-derived radicals, particu- 
larly when the peroxy group is bound to secondary carbon in the β
position ( Figure 40 a). Second, concerted elimination of HO ˙ O from 
both primary and secondary peroxy radicals of methyl propanoate 
were higher by 10 1 at 500 K than for alkylperoxy radicals ( Figure 
40 b). In both cases, at 10 0 0 K, the difference between the two rate 
coeﬃcients decreases to approximately a factor of 2, with the rate 
coeﬃcients for the ester-related reactions remaining higher. 

Tao and Lin [603] used the G3MP2B3 composite method to cal- 
culate potential energy surfaces for methyl butanoate radicals re- 
actions  with  O 
2  and  for  reactions  of  the  four  ester-peroxy  radi- 
cals with HO ˙ O . The latter type, initially proposed in Fisher et al. 
[669] , form hydroperoxy-substituted methyl butanoates that pro- 
mote  chain  reaction  via  barrierless  dissociation  into  ˙ O H + alkoxy 
radicals. In total, high-pressure limit rate coeﬃcients and Arrhe-

elimination  from  ˙ Q OOH.  The  isomeric  composition  was  not  de- 
termined, although the observed fragment ion pattern in methyl 
pentanoate  oxidation  was  consistent  with  a  contribution  from 
methyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylate, which would be formed via 
a resonance-stabilized  ˙ Q OOH. 

In another low-pressure MPIMS study, Czekner et al. [606] stud- 
ied product formation from chlorine-initiated oxidation of methyl 
butanoate  and  ethyl  butanoate  at  550  K.  Potential  energy  sur- 
face calculations of HO ˙ O -elimination pathways from peroxy radi- 
cals and several types of β-scission channels were conducted on 
the two esters using CBS-QB3. Similar to Muller et al. [605] , ion 
signal  was  detected  at  the  m/z  corresponding  to  cyclic  ethers, 
yet  no  isomers  were  not  identiﬁed.  Two  additional  types  of 
pathways were postulated to explain the observed production of 
aldehydes from methyl butanoate and ethyl butanoate oxidation: 
(1)  elimination  of  aldehyde  from  RO ˙ O  derived  from  α radicals 
(where  the  radical  site  resides  on  the  alkoxy  portion  of  the  es- 
ter), and (2) a bimolecular reaction between RO ˙ O and HO ˙ O rad- 
icals leading to a hydroperoxy-substituted ester that decomposes 
to aldehyde + resonance-stabilized ester radical. Figure 42 depicts 
the pathway leading to acetaldehyde + ester radical. An analogous 
pathway to formaldehyde was also considered, where the peroxy 
group is located on the terminal carbon of the alkyl group [606] . 

Tao  and  Lin  [668]  calculated  unimolecular  reaction  rates  of 
three pathways for methyl octanoate peroxy radicals: dissociation 
(RO ˙ O → ˙ R + O 
2 ),  isomerization  to  ˙ Q OOH,  and  concerted  elimina- 
tion of HO ˙ O . Rates were caculated in the high-pressure limit using 
canonical transition state theory with Eckart tunneling corrections 
and in the fall-off region using RRKM theory. Branching ratio anal- 

34 

ysis revealed that RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH, primarily via 6-membered tran- 
sition states, were the dominant reactions below ∼800 K, above 
which  dissociation  reactions  became  competitive.  One  exception 
involved  the  radical  in  which  the  peroxy  group  is  bound  to  the 
alkoxy  site  ( α),  which  undergoes  a  9-membered  transition  state 
and abstracts hydrogen from carbon in the γ (cid:9) position relative to 
the ester group (cf. Figure 30 ). Branching ratios predicted in the 
high-pressure  limit  showed  signiﬁcant  differences  with  the  bal- 
ance between dissociation and isomerization employed in chem- 
ical kinetics mechanisms [ 670 , 671 ], which had been derived using 
rate-rules and structure-activity relationships. Tao and Lin [668] in- 
corporated  high-pressure-limit  rate  parameters  into  the  detailed 
mechanism of Togbé et al. [671] , and found improved predictions, 
particularly in the NTC region, for methyl octanoate consumption 
proﬁles from JSR experiments, suggesting that direct ab initio cal- 
culations can improve on analogy-based approaches for functional- 
ized molecules. 

2 CHCHC( = O)OCH 

For resonance-stabilized radicals, the lower stability of the per- 
oxy radical product may limit the signiﬁcance of reactions with O 
2 
under combustion conditions. Joshi et al. [667] measured an up- 
per limit rate coeﬃcient of 7.5 • 10 -17 cm 3 molec. –1 s –1 for reac- 
tion of the allylic radical ( ˙CH 
3 ) of methyl but-2- 
enoate with O 
2 at 600 K. Because of the ineﬃcient reaction with 
2 , unimolecular reactions were considered as a primary consump- 
O 
tion  channel.  As  an  example,  Joshi  et  al.  [667]  calculated  a  fa- 
vorable isomerization step via ring-closure over a barrier of ∼35 
kcal/mol, which led subsequently to furan-2(5 H )-one + ˙CH 
3 over a 
barrier of 21.2 kcal/mol; master equation modeling using MESMER 
[672] could match the experiments only with a substantial lower- 
ing of the barriers to reaction. 

3.2.3. Speciation from thermally initiated experiments 

Speciation  measurements  below  10 0 0  K  include  ﬂow  reactor 
experiments  on  numerous  methyl  esters:  methyl  formate  [641] , 
methyl  acetate  [673] ,  methyl  butanoate  [602-606] ,  methyl  trans - 
2-butenoate  [609] ,  methyl  hexanoate  [ 612 ,  674 ],  methyl  trans -3- 
hexenoate [ 619 , 675 ], methyl heptanoate [623] , methyl octanoate 
[ 676 , 677 ], methyl trans -2-octenoate [ 676 , 677 ], methyl decanoate 
[624] , methyl palmitate [678] , methyl stearate [618] , methyl oleate 
[ 618 , 678 ], and methyl linoleate [ 618 , 678 ]. In contrast, only two 
low-temperature speciation studies exist for ethyl esters: laminar 
ﬂow  reactor  experiments  of  Bennadji  et  al.  [679]  on  ethyl  bu- 
tanoate, and JSR experiments on ethyl pentanoate in Dayma et al. 
[622] . Similarly, Dayma et al. [680] conducted the only speciation 
study on a propyl ester, propyl acetate. Several ester-based blended 
studies are also reported [ 625 , 671 , 6 81-6 83 ]. 

Dooley  et  al.  [641]  studied  the  oxidation  of  methyl  formate 
using  a  variable-pressure  ﬂow  reactor  at  3  atm  and  900  K  and 
developed  a  detailed  chemical  kinetics  mechanism,  which  in-

mation of stabilized peroxy radical adducts or subsequent isomer- 
ization reactions (RO ˙ O (cid:2) ˙ Q OOH). 

Rodriguez et al. [618] also examined the effect of unsaturated 
carbon in JSR experiments conducted at 1 atm from 500 – 1050 
K on three species found in practical biodiesel ( Figure 44 ). Con- 
sumption proﬁles of methyl stearate (18:0), methyl oleate (18:1), 
and  methyl  linoleate  (18:2)  exhibited  NTC  behavior  ( Figure  45 ) 
that conﬁrms prior predictions in Westbrook et al. [626] and Da- 
gaut et al. [619] that the presence of unsaturated carbon dimin- 
ishes the role of peroxy radical chemistry in ester oxidation, i.e. 
decreased NTC behavior with increasing unsaturation. As observed 
in the oxidation of unsaturated alcohols [506] , product pairs from 
Waddington-type  reactions  were  formed  in  the  two  unsaturated 
esters,  e.g.  nonanal  and  methyl  10-oxodecanoate  in  the  case  of 
methyl oleate, which indicates that  ˙ O H-addition reactions play a 
role in ester oxidation. 

Speciation measurements on methyl oleate oxidation in a JSR at 
1 atm by Bax et al. [625] quantiﬁed products from radical-addition 
reactions to the single C = C bond in methyl oleate, namely methyl 
10-oxooctadecanoate  and  methyl  8-(3-octyloxiran-2-yl)octanoate. 
The oxirane was proposed to arise from an epoxidation reaction 
that  consumes  HO ˙ O  and  produces  cyclic  ether + ˙ O H  ( Figure  46 ). 
Cagnina  et  al.  [656]  calculated  stationary  points  for  epoxidation 
of  methyl  trans -3-hexenoate  by  HO ˙ O  at  the  CCSD(T)-F12//M06- 
2X level and applied RRKM master equation to derive rate coeﬃ- 
cients. The results were consistent with rate rules for HO ˙ O + alkene 
in  Villano  et  al.  [407]  and  with  measurements  from  Walker  et 
al. [690] on trans -2-hexene oxidation. Cagnina et al. [656] incor- 
porated  the  computed  rate  coeﬃcients  into  the  mechanism  of 
Wagnon et al. [675] and predicted oxirane species that were qual- 
itatively consistent with the experiments of Bax et al. [625] . Epox- 
idation rates are similar to H-abstraction reactions by HO ˙ O at the 
same temperature [621] . For example, at 100 atm, the rate coef- 
ﬁcient  for  epoxidation  at  800  K  is  4.0  • 10 –17  cm 3  s –1  and  for 
H-abstraction  from  methyl  butanoate  in  the  high-pressure  limit, 
k (800  K) = 3.4  • 10 –17  cm 3  s –1 .  Noting  that  methyl  oleate  con- 
tains only one C = C bond, the importance of epoxidation reactions 
may become more signiﬁcant with polyunsaturated esters, such as 
methyl linoleate or methyl linolenate. 

Because of the incremental degree of unsaturation among the 
three species, the experiments of Rodriguez et al. [618] revealed 
several details related to the effect of C = C bonds in the alkyl chain 
on oxidation pathways in esters. First, low-temperature formalde- 
hyde production was evident only in the saturated ester, methyl 
stearate, and in the range 600 – 650 K. From prior JSR experiments 
on methyl butanoate [608] and methyl heptanoate [623] , formalde- 
hyde produced below 10 0 0 K is ascribed primarily to the decom- 
position of ester radicals via C–O bond-scission, wherein the un- 
paired electron is localized on the alkoxy group. Dayma et al. [674] , 
in experiments on methyl hexanoate at 10 atm, proposed a  ˙ Q OOH- 
mediated pathway involving the formation of 5-butyl-1,3-dioxolan- 
4-one as a precursor to formaldehyde. Both types of reactions im- 
ply that formaldehyde is derived primarily from reactions involving 
the ester moiety. Second, an increase in the number of C = C bonds 
from methyl stearate (C18:0) to methyl linoleate (C18:2) correlated 
with  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  1-alkene  species.  In  methyl 
stearate  oxidation,  1-butene  up  to  1-hexadecene  were  produced, 
which is likely due to the length of the alkyl chain and increased 
number of pathways to different alkene species via C–C β-scission 
reactions. Methyl linoleate oxidation, in contrast, produced only 1- 
butene. Third, diene formation near ∼850 K was more abundant in 
Rodriguez et al. [618] for methyl linoleate than for methyl stearate. 
To explain the observed increase in the context of unsaturated car- 
bon, a six-center decomposition reaction starting was postulated 
( Figure 47 ) wherein concerted C–C bond-scission reactions involv- 
ing the C = C bond lead to saturated ester + diene. A similar, four-

Modeling the chemical kinetics of methyl formate oxidation and 
other small esters, including methyl acetate [673] , is important to 
understanding the role of the ester moiety. Because of the initial 
perception [669] , based on chemical kinetics models that predicted 
similar ignition behavior to practical biodiesel, several studies ex- 
amined  the  low-temperature  oxidation  chemistry  of  methyl  bu- 
tanoate using JSR experiments [607-611] . As evidenced in species 
proﬁle measurements [ 608 , 609 ], NTC behavior was not observed. 
As a result, methyl butanoate is no longer considered a biodiesel 
surrogate and subsequent studies examined larger saturated esters 
[ 612 , 618 , 623 , 624 , 674 , 676 , 677 ]. 

With  increasing  length  of  the  alkyl  chain  in  esters,  low- 
temperature  oxidation  pathways  become  similar  to  those  of  the 
analogous  hydrocarbon,  and  the  impact  of  the  functional  group 
becomes diminished [683] . Isomerization reactions and decompo- 
sition  of  ester  radicals  becomes  important  with  increasing  alkyl 
chain length, as noted in the JSR studies on methyl pentanoate and 
methyl hexanoate oxidation in Dayma et al. [ 622 , 623 ], on methyl 
decanoate oxidation in Glaude et al. [624] , and in quantum chemi- 
cal calculations [ 6 84 , 6 85 ]. Methyl esters with an alkyl chain larger 
than ﬁve carbon atoms (i.e. methyl pentanoate and larger) exhibit 
clear NTC behavior, and because of the propensity of larger alkyl 
chains to undergo C–C β-scission reactions, alkane chemistry is an 
integral part of methyl ester oxidation [622-624] . 

The alkyl chain of practical methyl esters in biodiesel, such as 
methyl linoleate, contains unsaturated carbon, which impacts low- 
temperature chain-branching due to lower O 
2 -addition rates to al- 
lylic radical sites and radical-addition reactions, similar to alkenes 
[ 60 , 6 86-6 89 ]. Zhang et al. [619] studied low-temperature oxida- 
tion of methyl trans -3-hexenoate using a jet-stirred reactor at 10 
atm and compared to measurements of the saturated ester, methyl 
hexanoate, at the same conditions as Dayma et al. [674] ( Figure 
43 ).  The  presence  of  the  single  C = C  bond  completely  inhibits 
chain-branching below 650 K and the diminished peroxy radical 
chemistry  prevents  NTC  behavior  typically  associated  with  satu- 
rated species, suggesting that the C = C bond inhibits either the for-

center reaction was postulated as a mechanism for the production 
of 1-alkene and unsaturated esters. 

Other  dissociation  reactions  are  facilitated  speciﬁcally  by  the 
ester functional group, including the formation of carboxylic acids 
by  ethene  elimination  in  ethyl  esters  [631] ,  as  observed  in  JSR 
experiments  by  Bennadji  et  al.  [679]  on  ethyl  butanoate  ( Figure 
48 )  and  by  Dayma  et  al.  [622]  on  ethyl  pentanoate.  Metcalfe  et 
al.  [691]  characterized  the  role  of  ethene  elimination  in  ethyl 
propanoate oxidation and proposed that the greater reactivity of 
ethyl propanoate over the isomeric methyl butanoate reﬂected the 
reactivity of the acid and ethene products of this molecular elimi- 
nation [613] . 

3.2.4. Inﬂuence of ester oxidation pathways on autoignition chemistry 
Early studies on the temperature dependence of ester oxidation 
by Parsons et al. [692-694] and Hoare et al. [695] showed NTC be- 
havior in ethyl formate, n -propyl formate, and methyl butanoate, 

although more recent JSR experiments [607-611] show only single- 
stage oxidation for methyl butanoate. More recent studies on low- 
temperature autoignition of esters involve ignition delay time mea- 
surements from either shock-tube or rapid-compression machine 
experiments.  The  chemical  mechanisms  differentiating  one  ester 
from another are inferred from analysis via detailed chemical ki- 
netics mechanisms. The two sections below review ignition delay 
times and chemical kinetics modeling of esters, focusing primarily 
on reactions below 10 0 0 K. Because several extensive reviews on 
the combustion of esters from Coniglio et al. [696] , Westbrook et 
al. [697] , and Lai et al. [698] provide in-depth analysis of chemical 
kinetics mechanism development, only the mechanisms published 
subsequent to those reviews are discussed in Section 3.2.4.2 . 

3.2.4.1. Ignition delay time measurements.  Ignition delay time mea- 
surements are reported for a large number of esters ( Table 2 ), only 
a  limited  number  of  which  are  below  10 0 0  K.  For  ethyl  esters, 
only four ignition studies exist, and three are restricted to high- 
temperature  shock  tube  measurements.  One  exception,  the  RCM 
experiments of Walton et al. [615] , measured ethyl propanoate ig- 
nition at 10 atm from 988 – 1117 K to compare with methyl bu- 
tanoate. The RCM measurements of Dooley et al. [614] from 640 
– 950 K and from 10 – 40 atm conﬁrmed that low-temperature

et al. [614] ) and n -butyl formate (Vranckx et al. [222] ). 

chain-branching is not signiﬁcant in methyl butanoate, as evident 
from  the  absence  of  an  NTC  region,  and  suggested  that  larger 
methyl esters are more appropriate for use as a biodiesel surrogate, 
as noted previously in the JSR experiments of Gäil et al. [608] . In 
the RCM experiments of Minetti et al. [612] near 15 atm, no igni- 
tion was observed below 800 K, above which autoignition occurred 
in a single stage. Other ignition delay time experiments on methyl 
butanoate provided additional conﬁrmation [ 610 , 615 , 617 ].

Figure 49 a compares ignition delay times of methyl butanoate 
from Dooley et al. [614] to n -butane at 10 atm. Above ∼875 K the 
ignition delay times of methyl butanoate are shorter by a factor 
of ∼10 than for n -butane, which may arise from higher rates of 
formation of HO ˙ O radicals from oxidation reactions of the ester. 
The  impact  of  HO ˙ O  on  ignition  is  related  to  hydrogen  peroxide 
chemistry – at higher [HO ˙ O ], abstraction reactions become increas- 
ingly important and contribute to higher concentrations of hydro- 
gen  peroxide.  With  increasing  temperature,  the  chain-branching

step via H 
Figure 49 b compares n -butane ignition delay times at 20 atm 
from Healy et al. [96] to measurements of n -butyl formate ignition 
from Vranckx et al. [222] . NTC behavior is weaker for n -butyl for- 
mate for the conditions in Figure 49 b. In comparison with methyl 
butanoate, one potential explanation for the shorter ignition times 
below 750 K for n -butyl formate concerns  ˙ Q OOH formation path- 
ways.  In  contrast  to  methyl  butanoate,  seven-membered  transi- 
tion  states  for  RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH  are  possible  on  the  alkyl  chain  for 
n -butyl  formate.  The  additional  pathway,  which  is  favorable  en- 
tropically  and  energetically,  may  divert  a  portion  of  the  ﬂux  of 
RO ˙ O radicals to chain-propagation pathways via cyclic ether + ˙ O H 
2 -addition reactions over the chain-inhibiting step 
or to second-O 
˙ R + O 
2 → conjugate alkene + HO ˙ O . As a result, lower concentration 
of hydroperoxyl radicals and higher concentration of  ˙ O H produced 
from n -butyl formate compared to methyl butanoate increases the 
rate of oxidation. 

Methyl  pentanoate  is  the  smallest  methyl  ester  that  exhibits 
NTC  behavior  [ 612 ,  702 ].  RCM  measurements  of  Weber  et  al. 
[702] conducted at 15 atm and 30 atm and from 680 – 1050 K 
revealed signiﬁcant NTC behavior and from a comparison of igni- 
tion trends with n -pentane [ 710 , 711 ] and with 1-pentanol [98] , 
the  authors  concluded  that  the  ester  functional  group  shifts  the 
NTC region towards lower temperatures. Similar conclusions were 
drawn in Minetti et al. [612] , who measured ignition delay from 
4 – 20 atm and 650 – 850 K for a series of saturated methyl es- 
ters (methyl butanoate, methyl pentanoate, methyl hexanoate, and 
methyl heptanoate) using a rapid compression machine. Second- 
stage  ignition  delay  times  correlated  with  alkyl  chain  length  –
methyl  heptanoate  producing  the  shortest  ignition  delay  times 
at  a  given  pressure.  First-stage  and  second-stage  ignition  times 
of methyl hexanoate and n -alkanes ( n -butane, n -pentane, and n -

anoate, n -pentane, and n -heptane at an average pressure of 8 atm. 

heptane) were measured at an average pressure of 8 atm ( Figure 
50 ), which revealed several implications of the ester group. First- 
stage ignition for n -pentane was longer than methyl hexanoate by 
a  factor  of  ∼3  indicating  that,  for  the  same  alkyl  chain  length, 
the ester group promotes ﬁrst-stage ignition. Moreover, the start of 
NTC behavior begins near 700 K for methyl hexanoate and ∼775 K 
for n -pentane. Low-temperature ignition of methyl hexanoate was 
more closely approximated by n -heptane, both species exhibiting 
a  nearly  identical  lower  limit  of  temperature  for  ignition  ( ∼620 
K) [612] and similar ﬁrst-stage ignition delay times were similar. 
Second-stage ignition times diverge with increasing temperature, 
however. At 750 K, the upper limit for comparison, ignition times 
for methyl hexanoate are nearly a factor of 10 longer than for n - 
heptane. 

From  the  JSR  experiments  of  Dagaut  et  al.  [619]  on  trans - 
methyl-3-hexenoate, in which species proﬁles did not exhibit two- 
stage oxidation, the presence of a single C = C bond likely inhibits 
NTC  behavior.  In  larger  esters,  the  effects  of  a  single  C = C  bond 
on  ignition  is  less  pronounced  ( Figure  51 ).  Oehlschlaeger  et  al. 
[708] measured ignition delay times of methyl decanoate, methyl 
trans -9-decenoate, and a 50/50 blend of methyl trans -5-decenoate 
and  methyl  trans -6-decenoate  at  an  average  pressure  of  20  atm 
and  from  700  – 1300  K.  Ignition  delays  for  the  saturated  ester 
and  methyl  9-decenoate  overlap  one  another  within  experimen- 
tal uncertainty and share the same NTC range: ∼700 – 870 K. The 
methyl 5-/6-decenoate blend displayed weak NTC behavior and is 
within a factor of 2 of methyl decanoate ignition times [707] in 
the  NTC  region.  The  ignition  trends  indicate  that  the  proximity 
of  C = C  bonds  to  the  ester  moiety  weakly  affects  ignition,  due

nism development in Fisher et al.  [669] for methyl formate and 
methyl butanoate, many mechanisms were developed for numer- 
ous esters ( Table 3 ). Two extensive reviews by Lai et al. [698] and 
by  Coniglio  et  al.  [696]  summarized  the  progress  on  methyl  es- 
ter combustion and several mechanisms developed since include: 
methyl  propanoate  (Felsmann  et  al.  [712] ),  methyl  pentanoate 
(Weber  et  al.  [702] ),  methyl  trans -3-hexenoate  (Wagnon  et  al. 
[675] and Dagaut et al. [619] ), and n-butyl formate (Vranckx et al. 
[222] ). 

Felsmann  et  al.  [712]  produced  a  detailed  mechanism  for 
methyl propanoate built on a prior mechanism for methyl acetate 
[713] .  RRKM  master  equation  calculations  were  conducted  using 
VariFlex [468] utilizing high-pressure limit rate coeﬃcients calcu- 
lated in Tan et al. [ 646 , 684 ] for H-abstraction reactions and for

ester  radical  decomposition.  Kumar  et  al.  [700]  conducted  igni- 
tion  delay  time  experiments  from  15  – 45  atm  and  899  – 1103 
K  using  a  rapid  compression  machine  and  modeled  the  results 
using  several  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms.  Despite  the  shorter 
alkyl  chain,  ignition  delay  times  below  950  K  were  shorter  for 
methyl acetate than for methyl propanoate – a trend also reﬂected 
in all of the chemical kinetics mechanisms [ 712 , 720 , 721 ]. Sen- 
sitivity analysis using the Felsmann et al. [712] mechanism indi- 
cated HOO-related reactions, including HO ˙ O + CH

and H-abstraction reactions at vinoxylic carbon ( α(cid:9) ) were common 
amongst  the  mechanisms.  Similar  reactions  involving  HO ˙ O  radi- 
cals were also identiﬁed in Kumar and Sung [617] using local and 
global uncertainty analysis of ignition delay times for methyl bu- 
tanoate, as well as H-abstraction from the α(cid:9)  carbon and subse- 
quent  reaction  of  the  vinoxylic  radical  with  O 
2  to  form  methyl 
trans -2-butenoate + HO ˙ O . 

2 O → H ˙CO + H 

Weber et al. [702] utilized RMG to develop a chemical kinetics 
mechanism  for  methyl  pentanoate  oxidation  and  compared  with 
ignition delay times from rapid compression machine experiments 
along  with  predictions  using  the  mechanism  from  Diévart  et  al. 
[720] . For both mechanisms, the predictions of temperature depen- 
dence were sharply inconsistent with experimental trends: ignition 
delay times for ( φ = 2) were a factor of ∼10 shorter at 775 K and 
a factor of ∼10 longer near 700 K. In addition, neither mechanism 
predicted the clear NTC behavior observed in the measurements. 
Differences between the two were noted in the predictions of ini- 
tial radical distributions. 

Two  detailed  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  exist  for  methyl 
trans -3-hexenoate  and  were  developed  to  model  the  effect  of  a 
C = C bond on methyl ester oxidation. Wagnon et al. [675] devel- 
oped a mechanism on the basis of the sub-mechanism for methyl 
trans -5-decenoate within the methyl decanoate mechanism of Her- 
binet et al. [722] . Dagaut et al. [619] expanded a prior mechanism 
developed for methyl hexanoate utilizing rate coeﬃcient analogies 
to 1-alkenes [688] and unsaturated esters [722] . Both mechanisms 
included rate parameters for Waddington-type oxidation reactions 
for radicals derived from  ˙ O H-addition to unsaturated carbon. 

Consistent  with  the  ignition  delay  time  measurements  of 
Oehlschlaeger et al. [706-708] (cf. Figure 51 ), predictions using the 
PSR module in ChemKin and the reaction mechanism of Westbrook 
et  al.  [626]  indicate  that  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  unsatu- 
rated  carbon  results  in  the  suppression  of  peroxy  radical  chem- 
istry. Figure 52 compares predictions of consumption proﬁles for 
stoichiometric  oxidation  of  several  methyl  esters  using  an  initial 
concentration  of  20 0 0  ppm,  He  as  the  diluent,  and  a  residence 
time of 1500 ms. Five methyl esters are compared: two saturated

Fig. 53.  Summary of ester functional group effects on low-temperature chain-branching. The leftward-pointing and downward-pointing arrows indicate a shift in ﬂux away 
from chain-branching pathways responsible for ignition. For initial radicals on the carbonyl side of the molecule, subsequent oxidation reactions are affected by the reduced 
reactivity of vinoxylic resonance stabilized radicals, similar to the chemistry of ketones. For initial radicals on the ether side of the molecule the –O– group cannot donate 
a hydrogen, which reduces chain-inhibiting HO ˙ O formation, and can increase the role of chain-propagating β-scission. Each type of initial radical is depicted in a separate 
plane, with different colors used as a guide. The alkane oxidation mechanism is depicted in the back plane for reference. Pathways that are enhanced by the effects of the 
functional group are emphasized with bold arrows and labels, and those that are diminished are made lighter or omitted. 

species (methyl stearate and methyl palmitate) and three unsat- 
urated species, methyl oleate (18:1), methyl linoleate (18:2), and 
methyl linolenate (18:3). The consumption proﬁles of the two satu- 
rated species are nearly identical. Comparing methyl stearate with 
methyl oleate, however, the inﬂuence of a single C = C bond posi- 
tion is apparent from 500 – 600 K where the consumption rate 
is lower for the unsaturated species. For an increasing number of 
C = C bonds, the effect is increased to the point where consumption 
of methyl linoleate and methyl linolenate begins near 675 K. Above 
800 K, the ignition trends of the esters converge. Similar effects 
during the oxidation of hexene isomers is reported in Bounaceur 
et al. [687] . 

3.2.5. Summary of ester functional group effects 

The  degree  to  which  the  ester  functional  group  affects  low- 
temperature  chain-branching  depends  on  the  size  of  the  alkyl 
substituent,  which  is  a  general  trait  of  both  hydrocarbons  and 
biofuels.  Two-stage  oxidation  chemistry  is  evident  in  methyl  es- 
ters larger than methyl butanoate. In addition to alkyl substituent 
size, the degree of unsaturation signiﬁcantly impacts the initiation 
step,  ˙ R + O 
2 reaction rates, and subsequent  ˙ Q OOH reactions there- 
after. Because conventional biodiesel is comprised of methyl esters 
with substituents of tetradecyl and larger, and contain up to three 
C = C  bonds,  additional  experimental  and  theoretical  studies  on 
moderate-sized species may provide a closer understanding as to 
the effects of the ester group on low-temperature chain-branching. 
However, because inﬂuence of the ester group diminishes with in- 
creasing substituent size, an open question remains as to the alkyl 
size where ester-derived effects such as resonance-stabilized ini- 
tial radicals, or alkoxy radicals, no longer impact overall oxidation. 
Figure  53  shows  the  low-temperature  chain-branching  scheme 
augmented to emphasize pathways that are affected by the ester 
functional group. 

Branching fractions of esters from initiation reactions with  ˙ O H 
and other radicals depends partly on bond energies and inﬂuence 
from pre-reaction complex formation. Thermochemical calculations 
indicate that bond energies on the methoxy group are lower by 

3  – 4  kcal/mol  compared to  primary  C–H  bonds  in  alkanes due 
to the higher electronegativity of oxygen. On the alkyl substituent, 
because of resonance stabilization, C–H bond energy on α(cid:9) carbon 
is 7 – 8 kcal/mol lower than the analogous secondary C–H bonds 
in alkanes. As in hydrocarbons, the presence of sp 2 carbon on the 
alkyl chain for larger methyl esters creates allylic hydrogen and, 
in cases where C = C bonds are separated by one methylene group 
2 –C = C–R), bis -allylic hydrogens are created. Compared 
(R–C = C–CH 
to secondary hydrogen in alkanes, allylic C–H bond energies are 
lower by ∼15 kcal/mol and bis -allylic are lower by ∼22 kcal/mol. 

For  H-abstraction  by  ˙ O H  and  HO ˙ O ,  branching  fractions  are 
reported  only  for  small  esters:  methyl  formate,  methyl  acetate, 
methyl  propanoate,  methyl  butanoate,  and  n -butyl  formate.  The 
choice  of  using  a  single-transition-state  model  versus  a  two- 
transition-state  model,  to  account  for  pre-reaction  complexes, 
may  not  strongly  affect  the  total  k (T),  yet  branching  ratios  are 
potentially  impacted.  For  example,  rate  coeﬃcients  for  methyl 
propanoate + ˙ O H  from  Tan  et  al.  [646]  (single  transition  state 
model) and Mendes et al. [620] (two-transition-state model) are 
within ∼50% of one another. However, the temperature dependen- 
cies of the branching ratios differ substantially. In contrast, for ab- 
straction reactions of methyl propanoate with HO ˙ O , k (T) from Tan 
et al. [646] (two-transition-state model) differs from Mendes et al. 
[621] (two-transition-state model) by approximately a factor of 5, 
yet branching ratios agree closely over a wide temperature range. 
Among the quantum chemical studies for reactions involving ei- 
ther  ˙ O H or HO ˙ O , abstraction of hydrogen from β(cid:9) carbon (on the 
alkyl chain) involves a pre-reaction complex and is favored in the 
high-pressure limit  at  temperatures  up  to  850  K  for  methyl  bu- 
tanoate and methyl pentanoate. As shown in MPIMS experiments 
[ 605 , 606 ] and quantum chemical calculations [666] , rates of for- 
mation of alkene + HO ˙ O from RO ˙ O radicals are higher than in anal- 
ogous  reactions  of  alkanes.  In  addition,  RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH  rates  are 
lower, compared to alkanes, when the ester moiety is contained 
within  the  transition  state  [603] .  The  combined  effect  of  prefer- 
ential formation of β(cid:9)  radicals in the initiation step, higher rates 
of HO ˙ O formation, and lower rates of  ˙ Q OOH formation contribute

The analogous mechanism involving α carbon is of comparatively 
smaller inﬂuence [734] , and rate coeﬃcients for H-abstraction by 
˙ O H from other sites (e.g. γ , δ, …) are unaffected by the carbonyl 
group [732] . Negative temperature dependence is observed when 
complex-mediated abstraction is of secondary or tertiary hydrogen 
on β carbon [730-732] . 

Complex-mediated abstraction was proposed in Wallington and 
Kurylo [662] , inferred from a shift in the activation energy from 
positive  ( E a  >  0)  in  ˙ O H + acetone,  to  E a  ≈ 0  in  butanone  and 
3-pentanone,  to  negative  ( E a  <  0)  in  reactions  of  ˙ O H  with  ke- 
tones  containing  alkyl  chains  larger  than  ethyl.  Wallington  and 
Kurylo  [662]  modeled  branching  fractions  by  a  structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) with k (T) for abstraction from α carbon simi- 
lar  to  alkanes  and  for β carbon  a  factor  of  ∼3  higher,  which  is 
in agreement with Atkinson [735] . Subsequently, the SAR results 
were supported in Dagaut et al. [730] from rate coeﬃcient mea- 
surements of  ˙ O H + dione species over the same temperature range: 
2,3-butanedione, 2,4-pentanedione, and 2,5-hexanedione. Le Calvé
et  al.  [732]  conﬁrmed  the  results  of  ˙ O H + acetone/butanone/2- 
hexanone  in  [ 662 ,  730 ]  and  expanded  on  the  measurements  of 
acyclic ketones to include branched ketones methyl-butanone and 
4-methyl-2-pentanone from 243 – 372 K. The negative temperature 
dependence in the trends of k (T) in reactions of  ˙ O H with branched 
ketones with more than one β carbon were consistent with [ 662 , 
730 ] and the experiments in Jiménez et al. [731] . 

Wallington and Kurylo [662] postulated a 6-membered oxygen - 
bonded adduct complex formed between the O atom in  ˙ O H and 
the O atom in the C = O group, with the  ˙ O H abstracting hydrogen 
from the β carbon, and a similar 7-membered complex involving 
γ carbon. Klamt [725] proposed the 7-membered hydrogen -bonded 
adduct complex (cf. Figure 54 c) for abstraction at the β carbon. 
The  molecular  dynamics  simulations  in  Frank  et  al.  [726]  of  H- 
abstraction  from  3-hexanone  and  the  calculations  of  Zhou  et  al. 
[734] and Alvarez-Idaboy et al. [733] lend support for the mech- 
anism proposed by Klamt [725] . 

Tranter and Walker [736] measured k (753 K) and products from 
reactions of acetone, butanone, and 3-pentanone with  ˙ O H and with 
˙ H at 500 Torr, reporting a rate coeﬃcient 30 – 40% lower compared 
to alkanes. Similar conclusions were drawn in Carr et al. [737] . The 
implicit result in both [736] and [737] is that the adduct complex 
and abstraction from β carbon is of lower importance to the over- 
all rate of H-abstraction from ketones by  ˙ O H at higher temperature. 
Using ab initio calculations, reaction mechanisms and rate co- 
eﬃcients  of  HO ˙ O  with  butanone  are  reported  in  Mendes  et  al. 
[78]  for  site-speciﬁc  H-abstraction  and  in  Zhou  et  al.  [738]  for 
HO ˙ O -addition  to  butanone.  Reactions  of  several  ketones  with 
HO ˙ O  were  included  in  Mendes  et  al.  [78] :  acetone,  butanone, 
2-pentanone,  methyl-butanone,  and  4-methyl-penta-2-one.  Tran- 
sition  states  were  identiﬁed  in  abstraction  reactions  of  H  atoms 
resulting in the formation of a pre-reaction complex formed via 
hydrogen-bonding between the H atom of the hydroperoxyl rad- 
ical  and  the  O  atom  of  the  carbonyl  group  and  the  abstraction 
coordinate  between  the  O  atom  of  hydroperoxyl  and  the  H  be- 
ing abstracted ( Figure 55 ). With the exception of abstraction re- 
actions from tertiary ( β) carbon in 4-methyl-penta-2-one, binding 
energies of the complexes were approximately 10 kcal/mol and be- 
cause hydrogen bonding leads to the loss of rotors in the transition 
state,  the  high-pressure  limit  rate  coeﬃcients  for  ketone + HO ˙ O 
were lower by more than a factor of 10 compared with analogous 
reactions in alkanes [78] . 

Zhou et al. [738] reported a series of ab initio calculations on 
the kinetics and mechanisms of HO ˙ O -addition to butanone, which 
forms hydroxy-substituted peroxy radicals (HO–RO ˙O) where both 
the OH and peroxy groups are bonded to the same carbon. Zhou 
et al. [738] concluded that, over the temperature range 600 – 1600

to the diminished chain-branching observed for smaller methyl es- 
ters. 

3.3. Ketones 

The carbonyl moiety in ketones imposes two effects on initi- 
ation steps that precede  ˙ R + O 
2  reactions that differ from analo- 
gous  reactions  in  alkanes:  (1)  distinct  hydrogen-abstraction  sites 
inﬂuenced  by  the  C = O  group  ( Figure  54 a),  two  of  which  intro- 
duce resonance-stabilization in subsequent ketonyl radicals ( Figure 
54 b), and (2) the potential for forming pre-reaction complexes be- 
tween  the  H  atom  in  an  abstracting  radical  (e.g.  ˙ O H,  HO ˙ O ,  …) 
and the O atom in the C = O group ( Figure 54 c). C–H bond ener- 
gies on carbon sites in closest proximity to the carbonyl group ( α
and α(cid:9) ) sites are reduced while bond energies on β, γ , and δ sites 
are similar to alkanes [723] . Hudzik and Bozzelli [723] conducted 
CBS-QB3 and G3MP2P3 calculations on the thermochemistry for a 
range of linear and branched ketones, indicating that C–H bonds 
in the α and α(cid:9) sites are lower compared to the analogous bond 
in alkanes. Similar results were reported in Thion et al. [724] for 
cyclopentanone. Vinoxylic stabilization in α and α(cid:9)  ketonyl radi- 
2 -addition because RO ˙ O well depths 
cals ( Figure 54 b) disfavors O 
are ∼15 kcal/mol shallower than alkylperoxy radicals owing to the 
loss of resonance stabilization (upon addition to O 
2 ). With increas- 
ing temperature, the weaker-bound RO ˙ O adduct preferentially dis- 
sociates  back  into  reactants  ˙ R + O 
2 ,  restricting  the  formation  of 
˙ Q OOH either through isomerization or direct pathways, which sub- 
sequently inhibits chain-branching. 

Aldehydes, where a hydrogen atom is one of the substituents 
bound to the carbonyl group, are a special case and are common 
combustion intermediates [727] yet are not regarded as biofuels. 
On the alkyl side, the effect of the carbonyl group on the neigh- 
boring C–H bond is similar to that in ketones. The weakest C–H 
bond is the aldehydic hydrogen, and loss of that hydrogen leaves 
an acyl radical that rapidly decarbonylates to give CO and an alkyl 
radical. 

3.3.1. Initiation reactions and branching fractions 

A  positive  temperature  dependence  is  observed  in  rate  coef- 
ﬁcients  for  acetone + ˙ O H  and  near-zero  temperature  dependence 
in  butanone + ˙ O H  [ 728 ,  729 ],  whereas  negative  temperature  de- 
pendence becomes pronounced in ketones with substituents larger 
than  ethyl,  with  minima  occurring  near  600  K  [ 728 ,  729 ].  The 
formation of a hydrogen-bonded pre-reaction complex (cf. Figure 
54 c)  facilitates  ˙ O H-initiated  H-abstraction  at  lower  temperatures 
primarily from β carbon, which becomes the dominant initiation 
step  for  ketones  larger  than  butanone  [ 662 ,  725 ,  726 ,  730-733 ]

from butanone by HO ˙ O [78] . 

K, abstraction exceeds the addition of HO ˙ O to the functionalized 
carbon in butanone by ∼10 2 at 1 atm. 

Kopp  et  al.  [739]  computed  rate  coeﬃcients  using  ab  initio 
methods for H-abstraction from butanone by  ˙CH 
3  and for subse- 
quent unimolecular reactions of butanonyl radicals, including iso- 
merization and C–C β-scission. The effects of non-Boltzmann dis- 
tributions were also examined and were deemed negligible at tem- 
peratures below 10 0 0 K and pressures above 1 atm. Total rate co- 
eﬃcients were ∼10 –16  cm 3  s –1  at 500 K and ∼10 –15  cm 3  s –1  at 
10 0 0  K.  Abstraction  from  the  secondary  (vinoxylic)  site  was  fa- 
vored,  while  branching  fractions  were  similar  for  the  other  two 
sites. 

Rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction  from  butanone  by  ˙ O H 
[734]  and  HO ˙ O  [78]  are  compared  in  Figure  56 a.  For  reactions 
with  ˙ O H, Zhou et al. [734] used the Møller-Plesset MP2 method 
with the 6-311G( d , p ) basis set, MP2/6-311G( d , p ), for geometry op- 
timization and energies were computed using the CCSD(T) method 
with correlation-consistent polarized split-valence multiple- ζ ba- 
sis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. High- 
pressure limit rate constants were computed with variational tran- 
sition state theory and conventional transition state theory as im- 
plemented in VariFlex [468] , which were largely consistent with 
experiments  [ 728 ,  729 ,  736 ,  737 ,  740 ].  Mendes  et  al.  [78]  em- 
ployed a similar computational approach for calculating rate co- 
eﬃcients  of  HO ˙ O + butanone → H 
2 + ˙ R .  As  with  other  systems, 
the  total  rate  coeﬃcient  for  abstraction  by  ˙ O H  is  several  orders 
of  magnitude  larger  than  for  abstraction  by  HO ˙ O ,  even  at  10 0 0 
K.  Zhou  et  al.  [734]  and  Mendes  et  al.  [78]  also  reported  site- 
speciﬁc  rate  coeﬃcients,  which  are  depicted  in  Figure  56 b.  For 
both  radicals,  abstraction  from  the  (secondary)  α carbon  is  fa- 
vored from 50 0 – 10 0 0 K, followed by abstraction from β carbon. 
For  ˙ O H,  branching  fractions  are  α: β: α(cid:9)  (500  K) = 0.70:0.21:0.09 
and α: β: α(cid:9) (10 0 0 K) = 0.54:0.27:0.19, respectively. For HO ˙ O , α: β: α(cid:9) 
(500 K) = 0.83:0.13:0.03 and α: β: α(cid:9) (10 0 0 K) = 0.60:0.27:0.13. Ab- 
straction from α carbon is favored by both radicals in part because 
the pathways are the lowest lying channels on the respective po- 
tential energy surfaces. For abstraction by HO ˙ O , the barrier height 
relative to the pre-reaction complex is the lowest by ∼4 kcal/mol 
and similarly for abstraction of α carbon by  ˙ O H. 

2 O 

Zhou et al. [79] employed the G4 method, benchmarked against 
CCSD(T)/CBS, to calculate high-pressure-limit rate coeﬃcients for 
H-abstraction  from  cyclopentanone,  including  reactions  with  ˙ O H 
and HO ˙ O ( Figure 56 c). Rate coeﬃcients for axial and equatorial po- 
sitions of hydrogen atoms were calculated separately and, for both 
α and β carbon, abstraction of hydrogen in the axial position is 
favored. In contrast to reactions with acyclic ketones, where selec- 
tivity in H-abstraction by  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O favors α carbon, the calcu- 
lations of Zhou et al. [79] revealed that, although abstraction from 
α carbon remains favored in reaction with HO ˙ O , abstraction from 
β carbon dominates reactions with  ˙ O H ( Figure 56 d). Similar results 
were reported in Thion et al. [724] at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level 
of theory, which predicted a pre-reaction complex of  ˙ O H with cy- 
clopentanone stabilized by 5.4 kcal/mol.

ing fractions for  ˙ O H + cyclopentanone → ˙ R + H 
2 O from Zhou et al. 
[79]  and  Thion  et  al.  [724] .  Over  the  temperature  range  500  –
10 0 0 K, branching towards β is favored by a factor of ∼2 above 
650 K. Both studies reﬂect a relatively weak dependence on tem- 
perature.  Rate  coeﬃcients  and  branching  fractions  for  other  H- 
abstraction reactions were also calculated in Zhou et al. [79] , in- 
cluding for Ö,  ˙H, and  ˙CH 
3 , and ring-opening reactions of initial cy- 
clopentanonyl radicals, and Thion et al.  [724] calculated k (T) for 
˙CH 

3 + cyclopentanone → CH 
Liu  et  al.  [741]  employed  shock  tube  experiments  and  UV 
laser-absorption spectroscopy to measure k (T) for  ˙ O H-initiated H- 
abstraction from cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone at 1.2 atm and 
from 900 – 1330 K. The measurements were ﬁt to an Arrhenius 
expression that included measurements from Dagaut et al. [730] at 
296 K, which enabled the rate parameters to include temperatures 
relevant  to  low-temperature  combustion  conditions  (i.e.  ∼500  –
800  K)  where  no  such  measurements  exist.  The  absence  of  any 
signiﬁcant negative temperature dependence led to the conclusion 
that,  in  both  cases,  ˙ O H-addition  to  the  carbonyl  group  is  negli- 
gible, which is similar to reactions with acetone where addition 
contributes to < 1% of the total rate coeﬃcient from 500 – 2000 K 
[734] . Site-speciﬁc rate coeﬃcients were not determined explicitly 
in Liu et al. [741] , although analytical estimates were made based 
on Zhou et al. [742] and indicated that branching fractions favor 
the formation of β radicals, which is the same conclusion drawn 
in Thion et al. [724] . 

Rate coeﬃcients for  ˙ O H + cyclopentanone from Liu et al. [741] , 
Dagaut et al. [730] , Thion et al. [724] , and Zhou et al. [742] are 
plotted  in  Figure  58 a.  The  theoretical  calculations  for  cyclopen- 
tanone  [ 724 ,  742 ]  are  within  15%  of  one  another  above  750  K, 
below which the two trends deviate due to differences in activa- 
tion energy and temperature dependence. The barrier to abstrac- 
tion  from α carbon  in  Zhou  et  al.  [742]  is  lower  than  Thion  et 
al. [724] by ∼1 kcal/mol and ∼0.5 kcal/mol lower for β carbon. 
Weaker temperature dependence is also predicted in [742] on both 
sites.  In  comparison  with  the  experimental  trend  for  cyclopen- 
tanone, Zhou et al. [742] is within a factor of ∼2 over the tem- 
perature range whereas Thion et al. [724] varies from a factor of 
∼3 at 10 0 0 K to ∼20% at 500 K. 

The k (T) measurements for  ˙ O H + cyclohexanone from Liu et al. 
[741] are plotted in Figure 58 b with the Dagaut et al. [730] value 
at  296  K  and  predictions  from  Thion  et  al.  [743]  and  Serinyel 
et  al.  [744] .  The  latter  model  utilized  rates  for  abstraction  of 
secondary  hydrogen  in  alkanes  for  β and  γ carbon  and  drew 
analogy for α carbon on cyclohexanone from  ˙ O H + acetone [745] . 
High-temperature predictions using the Serinyel et al. mechanism 
[744]  are  consistent  with  the  experimental  results  of  Liu  et  al. 
[741] to within 20%. Deviations are evident at lower temperatures 
that are less relevant to combustion. 

Theoretical calculations for k (T) of analogous reactions for cy- 
clopentane  and  cyclohexane  from  Sivaramakrishnan  and  Michael 
[746] , conducted at the B3-LYP/6-31G( d ) and G3//B3LYP levels of 
theory and remarkably consistent with experiments [747-756] , are 
compared in Figure 58 to highlight the inﬂuence of the carbonyl 
group. In both cases, k (T) for the ketone species is lower by a fac- 
tor of ∼2. On a per-H-atom basis, β-sites rates are similar among 
the various studies to within ∼30% ( Figure 58 c and d), which indi- 
cates that the lower rate coeﬃcients reﬂect reduced abstraction at 
the α site, largely because of hydrogen bonding in the pre-reaction 
complex.

nated  the  oxidation  of  α radicals  of  cyclopentanone,  cyclohex- 
anone,  and  2-methylcyclopentanone  and  chain-propagation  via 
cyclic ether + ˙ O H were stated as being of lower importance due to 
weak signal detected at the corresponding nominal m/z in all three 
cases  [757] .  A  Dowd-Beckwith  ring-expansion  reaction  ( Figure 
59 )  was  postulated  in  the  oxidation  of  2-methylcyclopentanone 
(forming  2-cyclohexen-1-one),  although  the  mechanism  was  not 
conﬁrmed experimentally due to nearly identical photoionization 
spectra  of  2-methylcyclopenten-1-one  and  the  expanded  prod- 
uct  2-cyclohexen-1-one.  Analogous  ketonyl  rearrangement  reac- 
tions via 1,2-acyl migration ( Figure 59 b) were conﬁrmed by Scheer 
et  al.  [302]  in  tert- butyl  ketones  and  were  critical  to  explaining 
HO ˙ O  forming  reactions  at  temperatures  above  550  K.  The  reac- 
tion  is  facilitated  by  a  thermodynamic  driving  force  (conversion 
of  a  primary  radical  to  a  tertiary  radical)  and  the  tertiary  rad- 
ical  4-methylpentan-2-on-4-yl  subsequently  undergoes  oxidation 
via chain-inhibiting HO ˙ O forming pathways. Radical rearrangement 
of  ˙ Q OOH radicals was also postulated [302] . 

MPIMS results by Scheer et al. from Cl-initiated oxidation of 3- 
pentanone at 8 Torr from 550 – 650 K [299] , and from the oxi- 
dation of deuterated isotopologues of 3-pentanone, with expanded 
experimental conditions to lower temperature (450 K) and higher 
pressure  (2  atm)  [758] ,  indicate  that  resonance-stabilized  ˙ Q OOH 
radicals play a central role and undergo facile chain-propagation 
reactions. In 3-pentanone oxidation, below 550 K, the predominant 
cyclic  ether  is  2,4-dimethyloxetan-3-one,  formed  via  resonance- 
stabilized  ˙ Q OOH produced by reaction of resonance-stabilized 3- 
2  [758] .  At  temperatures  above  550  K  the 
pentanon-2-yl  with  O 
photoionization spectrum at the m/z corresponding to cyclic ether 
is dominated by 2-methyltetrahydrofuran-3-one, a product of ox- 
idation  of  the  non-resonance-stabilized  3-pentanon-1-yl  radical. 
Similar to Rotavera et al. [759] in a study on oxidation of iso -propyl 
toluene  isomers,  a  shift  in  the  chain-propagation  mechanism 
with temperature was observed, where higher temperature favors 
mechanisms derived from non-resonance-stabilized initial radicals. 
With increasing temperature and increasing contribution from re-

2  [760]  and  2-butanon-3-yl + O 

Sebbar et al. [760-762] conducted a series of quantum chemical 
calculations on thermochemistry and pressure- and temperature- 
dependent rate coeﬃcients for reactions derived from 2-butanon- 
1-yl + O 
2  [761]  over  the  tempera- 
ture  range  50 0  – 250 0  K.  In  addition  to  potential  energy  sur- 
face calculations for 2-butanon-4-yl + O 
2 , Sebbar et al. [762] cal- 
culated several surfaces for decomposition products of  ˙ Q OOH rad- 
icals.  Several  methods  were  employed  for  all  three  systems,  in- 
cluding G3MP2B3, G3, G3MP3. Sebbar et al. [762] noted a substan- 
tial range of energy estimates among the B3LYP, G3MP2B3, and G3 
methods used for most of the calculations, and carried out G3MP2, 
CBS-QB3, and CBS-APNO calculation methods for some transition 
states. As part of an investigation of second O 
2 addition reactions 
by  Kuzhanthaivelan  and  Rajakumar  [763]  ( vide  infra ),  higher  ac- 
curacy (CBS-QB3) quantum chemistry on the initial butanone ox- 
idation steps was reported, which is in qualitative agreement with 
the pathways outlined earlier in Sebbar et al. [760-762] . However, 
in several cases, such as OH-elimination from  ˙ Q OOH, the barrier 
heights calculated using CBS-QB3 differed by more than 3 kcal/mol 
from Sebbar et al. [ 760 , 761 ]. 

Sebbar  et  al.  [760]  found  the  2-butanon-1-yl + O 

2  reaction 
forms  a  chemically  activated  RO ˙ O  with  27  kcal/mol  of  excess 
energy  for  which  stabilization,  isomerization  to  ˙ Q OOH,  and  for- 
ward/reverse  reactions  were  considered.  Two  previously  unre- 
ported chain-propagating reactions of  ˙ Q OOH were proposed [760] : 
water-elimination leading to an oxy radical ( ˙O–CH 
2 ) 
coincident with H 
2 O ( Figure 60 a) and an OH-elimination reaction 
leading to 2-hydroxybut-2-enal. The latter reaction is initiated by 
2 C(OOH)C( = O) ˙CHCH 
hydrogen transfer from the –OOH group in H 
3 
to the oxygen of the carbonyl group to form a peroxy-substituted 
enol  ( Figure  60 b),  which  was  competitive  below  10 0 0  K  with 

2 C( = O)CHCH

functional  group:  (a)  Dowd-Beckwith  ring-expansion  reaction  of  2-methylene- 
cyclopentan-1-one forming 2-cyclohexen-1-one [757] . (b) Similar rearrangement re- 
action in methyl- tert -butyl ketone [302] . Subsequent reaction of the rearranged 
4-methyl-penta-2-on-4-yl  with  O 2  led  to  the  formation  of  4-methyl-3-penten- 
2-one in methyl- iso -butyl ketone oxidation at 550 K and 4-methyl-4-penten-2- 
one at 650 K [302] . (c) OH-loss from γ -ketohydroperoxide of 3-pentanone (4-

pentan-3-one-1,1,1,5,5,5-d 
6 in [758] at high oxygen concentrations 
( >  10 17  molecules  cm –3 )  led  to  the  detection  and  identiﬁcation 
of a speciﬁc ketohydroperoxide species, 4-hydroperoxypentane-2,3- 
dione,  as  the  lone  γ ketohydroperoxide  isomer  derived  from  3- 
pentanone  oxidation.  Experimental  evidence  for  the  decomposi- 
tion of 4-hydroperoxypentane-2,3-dione via three channels was re- 
ported: (1) Korcek decomposition into acetic acid and methylgly-

the  most-favored  being  reverse-isomerization  to  the  initial  RO ˙ O . 
Subsequent  RO ˙O  (cid:2) ˙ Q OOH  isomerization  via  a  four-membered 
transition state and OH-elimination leads to 2-hydroxybut-2-enal, 
although  the  barrier  for  the  four-center  isomerization  exceeds 
the  ˙ R + O 
2  entrance  channel.  Rate  coeﬃcients  were  calculated 
at  1  atm  for  unimolecular  reaction  of  two  of  the  hydroperox- 
yketonyl  radicals.  Decomposition  of  the  non-resonance-stabilized 
H 
2  is  dominated  by  chain-propagation  into 
tetrahydrofuran-3-one + ˙OH, with a barrier similar to reverse iso- 
merization  ( ˙ Q OOH → RO ˙ O ).  In  contrast,  the  resonance-stabilized 
H 
3  reacts primarily via dissociation back into 
RO ˙ O and the hydrogen transfer from the HO ˙ O group to the car- 
bonyl  resulting  in  an  enol-peroxy  radical,  with  some  competi- 
tion from water-elimination and concerted O–O and C–C bond ﬁs- 
sion into methyl ketene + formaldehyde + ˙ O H. Because the  ˙ R + O 
2 
(cid:2) RO ˙O  reaction  is  reversable  at  moderate  temperatures,  the β- 
scission reaction of 2-butanon-1-yl into ketene + ethyl is also im- 
portant to consider and can compete with the forward reaction. 

2 C(OOH)C( = O) ˙CHCH 

In  the  2-butanon-3-yl + O 

2  reactions  below  10 0 0  K,  two 
product  channels  were  dominant  [761] :  direct  formation  of 
methylvinyl  ketone + HO ˙ O  and  isomerization  of  the  peroxy 
3 CC( = O)CH(O ˙O)CH 
3  to  the  resonance-stabilized  hy- 
adduct  H 
2 ˙CC( = O)CH(OOH)CH 
droperoxyketonyl  radical  H 
3 .  The  reverse 
reaction  to  RO ˙ O  dominates,  followed  by  the  chain-branching 
channel  acetaldehyde + acetyl + Ö and  chain-propagating  chan- 
nel  2-methyl-oxetan-3-one + ˙ O H.  Isomerization  to  the  non- 
3 CC( = O)CH(OOH) ˙CH 
resonance-stabilized  hydroperoxyketonyl  H 
2 
was of minor importance. In contrast to the resonance-stabilized 
the  non-resonance-stabilized  hydroper- 
hydroperoxyketonyl, 
oxyketonyl  H 
2  predominantly  reacts  via 
chain-propagation,  to  1-(oxiran-2-yl)-ethanone + ˙ O H,  and  via 
chain-inhibiting, to methylvinyl ketone + HO ˙ O , while reverse reac- 
tion to the peroxy adduct H 

3 CC( = O)CH(OOH) ˙CH 

3 CC( = O)CH(O ˙O)CH 

3 is insigniﬁcant. 

2-butanon-4-yl + O 

2 → RO ˙ O forms a chemically activated adduct 
with  35  kcal/mol  of  excess  energy  [762] .  The  barriers  for  both 
possible cyclic ether + ˙ O H channels (forming either dihydrofuran- 
3(2 H )-one or 1-(oxiran-2-yl)-ethanone) are below the 2-butanon- 
4-yl + O 
2 reactants. However, no speciation measurements are re- 
ported  in  the  literature,  as  noted  in  Hemken  et  al.  [764] .  In 
comparison  to  the  2-butanon-3-yl + O 
2  [761]  calculations,  direct 
RO ˙ O → methyl vinyl ketone + HO ˙ O is favored more in 2-butanon- 
4-yl + O 
2  due to the combination of a deeper RO ˙ O well (by ∼10 
kcal/mol) and to the lower C–H bond energy on the vinoxylic site. 
Sebbar et al. [762] discovered an alternative chain-propagation 
pathway via the formation of a 5-membered cyclic peroxy radical 
intermediate ( Figure 61 ) by attack of the –O ˙ O group on the elec- 
trophilic carbon end of the carbonyl. The barrier height is simi- 
lar to that for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH via a 7-membered transition state and 
the two channels were the lowest on the RO ˙ O surface. The cyclic 

Khanniche  and  Green  [765]  calculated  stationary  point  en- 
ergies  using  CBS-QB3  on  potential  energy  surfaces  and  high- 
pressure  limit  rate  coeﬃcients  using  CanTherm  [766]  for  reac- 
tions  of  α-cyclopentanonyl  and  β-cyclopentanonyl  with  O 
2 .  The 
reaction  of  resonance-stabilized  α-cyclopentanonyl + O 
2  forms  a 
weakly  bound  RO ˙ O  (19.4  kcal/mol  below  the  entrance  channel), 
due  to  the  loss  of  resonance  in α-cyclopentanonyl  upon  O 
2  ad- 
dition. On the surface of α-cyclopentanonylperoxy ( α-RO ˙ O ), HO ˙ O 
elimination to form cyclopent-2-en-1-one is the only channel with 
barriers  below  the  α-cyclopentanonyl + O 
2  reactant  energy.  The 
surface for β-RO ˙ O is signiﬁcantly more complex, with several com- 
peting  channels,  including  conventional  pathways  such  as  HOO- 
elimination  forming  both  cyclopent-2-en-1-one  and  cyclopent-3- 
en-1-one, cyclic ether + ˙ O H, and a  ˙ Q OOH ring-opening mechanism. 
Transition states for hydrogen transfer from the –OOH group to the 
carbonyl group to form an enol-peroxy radical ( Figure 62 a) were 
identiﬁed  on  both  ˙ Q OOH  surfaces.  However,  only  on  the α-RO ˙ O 
surface is the reaction competitive with other  ˙ Q OOH decomposi- 
tion pathways. 

Because the equilibrium α-cyclopentanonyl + O 

2  (cid:2) α-RO ˙ O fa- 
vors  the  reactant  side  at  combustion-relevant  conditions,  cal- 
culations  were  also  conducted  on  the  surface  of  the  adduct 
from  HO ˙ O + α-cyclopentanonyl,  2-hydroperoxycyclopentan-1-one. 
On  the  surface  of  2-hydroperoxycyclopentan-1-one  – a  ketohy- 
droperoxide structure – the well-depth is 54.5 kcal/mol below the 
energy  of  the  entrance  channel.  Transition  states  for  ﬁve  reac- 
tion pathways of 2-hydroperoxycyclopentan-1-one were calculated, 
four  of  which  were  submerged:  two  water-elimination  mech- 
anisms,  yielding  1,2-cyclopentadione + H 
2 O,  an  OH-elimination 
channel occurring via O–O bond-scission ( Figure 62 b), and a con- 
certed OH-transfer/ring-opening reaction ( Figure 62 c) yielding 4- 
formylbutyric  acid  (HO–C( = O)(CH 
3 CHO).  The  rates  of  the  con- 
certed reaction and of the OH-elimination channels are more than 
an  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  water-elimination  at  700  K 
[765] . 

2 ) 

Zhang et al. [767] used the CBS-QB3 level of theory and cal- 
culated  site-speciﬁc  rate  coeﬃcients  for  RO ˙ O → alkene + HO ˙ O  re- 
actions in cyclopentanone oxidation by canonical transition state 
theory  in  CanTherm  [766]  including  hindered-rotor  and  one- 
dimensional Eckart tunneling corrections. The barrier heights for 
the  pathways  leading  to  cyclopent-2-en-1-one  from  both α-RO ˙ O 
and β-RO ˙ O  differed  by  ∼1.5  kcal/mol,  which  is  within  the  limit 
of uncertainty of the method, and both were lower than the path- 
way from β-RO ˙ O to cyclopent-3-en-1-one because of the reduced 
bond energy on α carbon. Figure 63 compares rates of direct HOO- 
elimination from [767] for the two peroxy radicals. Below 10 0 0 K, 
the rate  of formation of  cyclopent-2-en-1-one exceeds  the other 
isomer  by  ∼10 1  – 10 2 .  The  MPIMS  experiments  of  Scheer  et  al. 
[757] at 550 K and 650 K observed substantial cyclopent-2-en-1- 
one, yet detected no cyclopent-3-en-1-one. 

Similar resonance stabilization effects occur in diones. Yommee 
and Bozzelli [769] calculated rate coeﬃcients for  ˙ R + O 
2 reactions 
in cyclopentadienone and related thermochemical properties of the 
species  involved  including  adducts  and  decomposition  products. 
Wang and Brezinsky [770] also calculated pathways and reaction 
rate coeﬃcients, for thermal decomposition of cyclopentadienone, 
using molecular orbital and RRKM calculations. Although not re- 
garded  as  a  biofuel,  cyclopentadieneone  is  formed  via  oxidation 
of cyclopentenone isomers, which are relevant to cyclopentanone 
combustion [ 724 , 757 ].

radicals  produced  from  that  isomerization  lead  subsequently  to 
ketohydroperoxide + ˙ O H.  Potential  energy  calculations  for  cyclic 
ether + ˙ O H from HOO ˙ P OOH were also included, namely the forma- 
tion  of  substituted  oxetane  species.  However,  for  both  cases  the 
barrier  heights  were  ∼20  kcal/mol  and  are  negligible  compared 
to the (barrierless) O–O bond scission to  ˙ O H + ketohydroperoxide. 
Calculations were also conducted by Kuzhanthaivelan and Rajaku- 
mar [771] on analogous radicals derived from 2-pentanone, which 
included pressure-dependent rates determined using RRKM theory.

oxy radical; (c) OH-transfer/ring-opening reaction producing carboxylic acid (5-

3.3.3. Speciation from thermally initiated experiments 

Speciation experiments from JSR and other thermally initiated 
ﬂow reactors on ketone oxidation include butanone [ 764 , 772-776 ], 
2-pentanone and 3-pentanone [777] , and two cyclic ketones, cy- 
clopentanone [724] , and cyclohexanone [ 743 , 744 ]. 

2 O 

Initial  studies  of  butanone  oxidation  at  low  temperatures  ( < 
750 K) were conducted by Bardwell and Hinshelwood [772-775] . 
More recently, FTIR and gas-chromatographic speciation measure- 
ments  of  butanone  oxidation  were  obtained  by  in  Thion  et  al. 
[776]  at  1  and  10  atm  and  from  725  – 1250  K,  using  a  jet- 
stirred reactor. Hemken et al. [764] conducted speciation measure- 
ments  from  butanone  oxidation  at  1  atm  using  a  laminar  ﬂow 
reactor  equipped  with  EI-MBMS,  which  utilized  17  eV  electrons 
for ionization, and focused on product formation relevant to low- 
temperature autoignition. Several key species were quantiﬁed, in- 
2 , β-scission  products  of  initial  butanonyl  radicals  –
cluding  H 
ethene,  ketene,  and  methyl  ketene  – and  an  unconﬁrmed  oxy- 
genated  species  with  the  molecular  formula  C 
2 .  The  latter 
species, methyl ketene, was detected by MBMS and is an impor- 
tant  species  that  forms  exclusively  from  unimolecular  decompo- 
sition of butanon-3-yl. Hemken et al. [764] ascribed the majority 
of the mole fraction of C 
2 ( m/z 86) to 2-methyloxetan-3-one, 
which is the lone cyclic ether formed along a pathway involving 
both resonance-stabilized  ˙ R and  ˙ Q OOH radicals. However, the au- 
thors noted that the uncertainty for 2-methyloxetan-3-one is sig- 
niﬁcant (factor of ∼5) because of a lack of cross-section measure- 
ments in the literature; Hemken et al. [764] employed the proce- 
dure of Schenk et al. [778] to estimate the cross-section. The dis- 
crepancies may also arise from an incomplete description of cyclic 
ether sub-mechanisms. Thion et al. [776] considered only diacetyl 
formation and excluded cyclic ether formation. However, Hemken

Fenard et al. [777] measured species proﬁles for 2-pentanone 
and  3-pentanone  oxidation,  using  the  laminar  ﬂow  reactor/EI- 
MBMS approach of Hemken et al. [764] , at 1 atm and from 800 
– 1050 K. Several species were quantiﬁed, including CO, CO 
2 O, 
4 , as well as species related to RO ˙ O chemistry, such as methyl 
C 
ketene. Cyclic ethers, which were predicted as abundant interme- 
diates from chemical kinetics modeling, were not reported and the 
isomeric composition of HOO-elimination products in 2-pentanone 
oxidation was not determined.

Cyclopentanone  oxidation  experiments  were  conducted  in 
Thion et al. [724] at 1 atm and 10 atm using a JSR. Species proﬁles 
were measured from 730 – 1280 K and exhibited no NTC chem- 
istry. With the exception of cyclopent-2-en-1-one and cyclopent-3- 
en-1-one, which were not isomer-resolved, proﬁles were measured 
for  alkenes,  carbonyls,  and  other  species  such  as  acetylene  that 
were produced from ring-opening reactions. Reaction mechanisms 
were proposed for several of the species detected, including acety- 
lene via H-abstraction from cyclopent-2-en-1-one from the α car- 
bon and subsequent ring-opening of the resonance-stabilized radi- 
cal. 

Serinyel et al. [744] reported JSR experiments on cyclohexanone 
oxidation, which were conducted at 10 atm and from 530 – 1220 K 
over a range of equivalence ratios. Cyclic intermediates formed via 
ring-opening  reactions  were  detected,  namely  cyclopentene  and 
cyclopentadiene.  Below  10 0 0  K,  several  other  ring-opened  prod- 
ucts were detected, including methyl vinyl ketone, 1,5-hexadiene, 
propene, and formaldehyde. In subsequent JSR experiments, con- 
ducted at 1 atm and 10 atm, Thion et al. [743] reported similar 
speciation results. Both studies detected only one of the two alkene 
isomers formed via  ˙ R + O 
2  reactions, cyclohex-2-en-1-one, which 
is consistent with the MPIMS results in Scheer et al. [757] . Similar 
to cyclopentanone, two-stage chemistry is not evident in cyclohex- 
anone oxidation. 

3.3.4. Inﬂuence of ketone oxidation pathways on autoignition 
chemistry 

Ignition  delay  time  measurements  below  10 0 0  K  are  re- 
ported  for  butanone  [ 764 ,  779 ,  780 ]  and  di- iso -propyl  ketone 
[781] , 2-pentanone [777] , 3-pentanone [ 777 , 782 ], and cyclopen- 
tanone [767] . NTC behavior is exhibited in di- iso -propyl ketone, 2- 
pentanone and 3-pentanone. Other measurements of ignition delay 
times, above 10 0 0 K, include acetone [783] , butanone [ 740 , 784 ] 
and  2-pentanone  [783] ,  3-pentanone  [ 783 ,  785 ],  and  cyclohex- 
anone [786] . Lam et al. [728] conducted shock tube measurements 
on ignition of a series of ketones from 1100 – 1400 K. Table 4 sum- 
marizes the chemical kinetics mechanisms produced for ketone ox- 
idation. Two mechanisms are reported for 3-pentanone, Serinyel et 
al. [785] and Fikri et al. [782] , yet neither include RO ˙ O chemistry 
since the mechanisms were developed for high-temperature com- 
bustion where the ketone is used as a chemiluminescence tracer in 
visualization experiments. Fenard et al. [777] developed a mecha- 

46 

nism for both 2-pentanone and 3-pentanone, which includes low- 
temperature chemistry. 

3.3.4.1. Ignition delay time experiments.  The RCM ignition measure- 
ments  of  stoichiometric  butanone  in  Hoppe  et  al.  [779]  covered 
850 – 950 K and did not exhibit NTC behavior at either 20 atm or 
40 atm. Burke et al. [780] extended the temperature range up to 
1280 K for the same pressures. Hemken et al. [764] expanded the 
conditions over which RCM experiments were reported in [780] , 
measuring ignition delay times at 40 atm from φ = 0.5 – 2.0. In 
contrast to butanone ignition, n -butane exhibits two-stage chem- 
istry due to the formation of ketohydroperoxides [ 788 , 789 ] with 
an NTC region starting near 750 K [551] . The difference in igni- 
tion behavior between the two C4 molecules implies that the C = O 
group in butanone facilitates HOO-elimination via  ˙ R + O 
2 reactions 
or acts as an impediment to the formation of  ˙ Q OOH and/or sub- 
2 -addition reactions leading to 
sequent consumption via second-O 
ketohydroperoxide formation. Figure 65 a compares stoichiometric 
ignition delay times of n -butane [96] and butanone [780] near ∼20 
atm. 

In  contrast,  NTC  behavior  is  displayed  in  ignition  delay  time 
trends of 2-pentanone and 3-pentanone. Fenard et al. [777] con- 
ducted RCM experiments at 20 atm and 40 atm covering from 650 
– 950 K. Despite the longer alkyl chain, which typically enhances 
low-temperature chemistry, chain-branching was less pronounced 
in 2-pentanone. For example, at 40 atm and 700 K, ignition de- 
lay times for 2-pentanone was ∼80 ms and for 3-pentanone ∼25 
ms. The lower reactivity of 2-pentanone was ascribed to increased 
ﬂux  of  initial  ˙ R  radicals  through  both  HOO-elimination  and  C–C 
β-scission  reactions,  both  of  which  are  inhibited  to  a  larger  ex- 
tent in 3-pentanone. In addition, at both pressures, the tempera- 
ture ranges over which NTC chemistry is evident differed substan- 
tially: ∼150 K for 3-pentanone and ∼50 K for 2-pentnaone. 

Figure  65 b  compares  ignition  delay  times  at  20  atm  of  2- 
pentanone and 3-pentanone from Fenard et al. [777] to n -pentane 
from Bugler et al. [554] , which exhibits an NTC region. All three 
trends overlap within experimental uncertainty above 10 0 0 K, be- 
low which the ignition delay times for n -pentane are signiﬁcantly 
shorter  due  to  more  favorable  chain-branching  (arising  from  a 
larger number of pathways and higher amount of secondary hy- 
drogen available for abstraction and intramolecular isomerization). 
At 800 K, compared to 2-pentanone, n -pentane ignition times in 
Figure 65 b are shorter by a factor of ∼50, and by a factor of ∼30 
compared to 3-pentanone. Fikri et al. [782] conducted ignition de- 
lay time measurements of 3-pentanone at 10 atm, 20 atm, and 40 
atm using a shock tube and covered a broad range of temperatures 
( ∼750 – 1200 K). The strong NTC behavior measured in the RCM 
experiments of Fenard et al. [777] was not observed in Fikri et al. 
[782] because the lower limit of temperature is near the inﬂection 
point where continued decrease in temperature starts leading to 
shorter ignition times (i.e. the end of the NTC region). 

Zhang et al. [767] measured ignition delay times for cyclopen- 
tanone using both shock tube and RCM experiments and no NTC 
behavior  was  observed.  The  experiments  were  conducted  using 
several equivalence ratios, two pressures (15 atm and 30 atm), and 
over the temperature range 794 – 1368 K. Time histories of CO for- 
mation behind reﬂected shock waves were also measured. Figure 
65 c compares the cyclopentanone ignition measurements in Zhang 
et al. [767] to cyclopentane ignition measurements [553] . However, 
the temperatures where ignition delay times overlap is limited to 
10 0 0 K and above. 

Allen  et  al.  [781]  measured  ignition  delay  times  for  di- iso - 
propyl ketone from 590 – 720 K at a nominal pressure of 10 atm 
using  an  RCM.  Despite  the  highly  branched  molecular  structure, 
di- iso -propyl ketone ignition exhibits appreciable two-stage chem- 
istry, facilitated in part by 1,2-acyl shift rearrangement of initial

havior started near 650 K in the experiments. 

3.3.4.2. Detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms.  Four chemical kinet- 
ics mechanisms exist for butanone oxidation: Serinyel et al. [784] , 
Burke  et  al.  [780] ,  Hemken  et  al.  [764] ,  and  Thion  et  al.  [776] . 
The ﬁrst-generation mechanism of Serinyel et al. [ 764 , 776 , 780 , 
784 ] excluded peroxy radical chemistry because high-temperature 
shock tube ignition delay times were used as benchmark measure- 
ments. Burke et al. [780] produced the ﬁrst low-temperature com- 
bustion mechanism of butanone by developing a sub-mechanism 
for peroxy radicals using rate rules from Curran et al. [385] . RCM 
and shock-tube ignition delay times were simulated and, consis- 
tent with the experiments, exhibited no signiﬁcant NTC behavior. 
Reaction  ﬂux  analyses  in  [780]  predicted  that  a  major  pathway 
for  consumption  of  initial  ketonyl  radicals  is  via  C–C  β-scission 
or  disproportionation  reactions  leading  to  alkoxy  radicals,  both 
disfavoring  RO ˙O  formation  necessary  for  low-temperature  chain- 
branching. Despite no indication of NTC behavior, the addition of 
low-temperature oxidation pathways, particularly HOO-elimination 
reactions, were essential in accurately predicting the ignition delay 
times. 

Thion et al. [776] produced a revised chemical kinetics mech- 
anism  for  butanone  based  on  Serinyel  et  al.  [784] .  Utilizing  po- 
tential  energy  surface  calculations  at  the  G3//MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ 
level  of  theory,  high-pressure  limit  rate  coeﬃcients  were  calcu- 
lated for H-abstraction by  ˙ H and  ˙CH 
3 using conventional transition 
state theory. Pressure-dependent rate coeﬃcients were calculated 
for β-scission and isomerization of the three butanon-x-yl radicals 
(where x = 1, 3, or 4) and homolysis of butanone. Rate parameters 
were also calculated for  ˙ O H-addition and HO ˙ O -addition reactions 
to resonance-stabilized butanon-3-yl radicals. The revised rate co- 

eﬃcients were combined with the addition of several reactions rel- 
evant to low-temperature oxidation into the mechanism [776] . 

Hemken et al. [764] revised the Burke et al. [780] mechanism 
to  include  updated  unimolecular  decomposition  reactions  of  bu- 
tanone  and  butanonyl  radicals  from  calculations  of  Thion  et  al. 
[ 764 , 776 , 780 , 784 ], higher rates for H-abstraction by HO ˙ O , and 
a  revised  methyl  ketene  sub-mechanism  that  included  thermal 
decomposition  (accounting  for  pressure-dependence  using  Troe 
parameters),  H-abstraction,  and  disproportionation  with  ˙ O H  and 
other radicals. Subsequent reactions of radicals from methyl ketene 
were also included. 

To compare the role of the ketone group on low-temperature 
oxidation, Figure 66 a compares simulations of the temperature de- 
pendence of butanone consumption using the mechanism of Thion 
et  al.  [776]  and  n -butane  consumption  using  the  mechanism  of 
Healy et al. [96] . Both were conducted using the PSR module in 
ChemKin. The conditions of the simulations are 10 atm, stoichio- 
metric, isothermal conditions at a residence time of 10 0 0 ms, un- 
der dilute conditions (initial concentrations were 10 0 0 ppm). Using 
the mechanism of Hemken et al. [764] , a similar butanone con- 
sumption  proﬁle  is  predicted.  Low-temperature  chain-branching 
and NTC behavior is evident for n -butane, starting around 600 K, 
which is due to  ˙ Q OOH + O 
2 reactions forming ketohydroperoxides 
( Figure 66 b). Owing to the reaction pathways including favorable 
reverse  reaction  rates  of  ketonylperoxy  radicals  (RO ˙ O )  to  ˙ R + O 
2 
[ 760 , 761 ] and of  ˙ Q OOH products, as well as facile C–C β-scission 
reactions  of  ketonyl  and  hydroperoxyketonyl  radicals  competing 
2 -addition [736] , chain-branching and subsequent two-stage 
with O 
ignition that is observed in n -butane oxidation is suppressed for 
butanone ( Figure 66 c). 

Using  a  chemical  kinetics  mechanism  produced  by  Reaction 
Mechanism Generator (RMG), simulations were conducted in Allen 
et al. [781] on ignition delay time and speciation results for di-

reaction pathways at 625 K in n -butane (b) and butanone (c). The chain-branching pathway in n -butane is responsible for accelerated depletion in the range ∼575 – 675 K. 
Analogous second-O 2 -addition reactions are hindered in butanone oxidation in favor of HOO-elimination, cyclic ether formation, or back dissociation of RO ˙ O into ˙ R + O 2 .

scission into an oxy radical. 

iso -propyl  ketone  from  RCM  and  MPIMS  experiments.  In  the  ig- 
nition delay time results at 10 bar, NTC behavior became evident 
over the temperature range 625 – 725 K and was ascribed to three 
reactions:  (1)  increased  rates  of  β-scission  of  primary  radicals 
with  increasing  temperature  leading  to  the  formation  of  methy- 
loxirane + propene + CO + ˙ O H, a reaction pathway conﬁrmed in the 
MPIMS experiments, (2) 1,2-acyl shift in primary radicals of di- iso - 
propyl ketone and subsequent reaction of the rearranged radicals 
with O 
2 , similar to methyl tert -butyl ketone (cf. Figure 59 b), and 
(3) chain-branching derived from unsaturated ketohydroperoxides 
formed via HOO-elimination from tertiary-tertiary  ˙ O OQOOH rad- 
icals ( Figure 67 ). Coordination of the reaction mechanism details 
produced from the MPIMS experiments along with the PES calcu- 
lations led to an initial mechanism produced using RMG. The initial 
simulations of ignition delay times predicted less-pronounced NTC 
behavior, although the mechanisms predictions were improved sig- 
niﬁcantly by accounting for resonance-stabilization in the underly- 
ing thermochemistry. 

Thion et al. [724] constructed a chemical kinetics mechanism 
for cyclopentanone oxidation, which built upon prior mechanisms 
for  butanone  [776]  and  for  butene  isomers  [ 790 ,  791 ],  and  pre- 
dicted species proﬁles from jet-stirred reactor experiments. Reac- 
tion  pathway  analysis  using  the  mechanism  indicated  that  ring- 
opening reactions were of central importance, e.g. cyclopentanon- 
3-yl → CO + but-1-en-4-yl. Thion et al. [724] remarked on the need 
to reﬁne the sub-mechanism for cyclopent-2-en-1-one due to in- 

consistencies between predictions and experiment related to acety- 
lene formation ( Figure 68 ), particularly at high pressure, in addi- 
tion to the formation of cyclopent-2-en-1-one [776] . Cyclic ether 
formation pathways were not included in the mechanism despite 
analogous reactions being submerged on the potential energy sur- 
face of cyclopentanyl peroxy radicals [768] . 

The  chemical  kinetics  mechanism  of  Zhang  et  al.  [767]  for 
cyclopentanone  was  constructed  from  the  mechanism  of  Thion 
et  al.  [724]  and  using  existing  mechanisms  for  alkanes  [792] . 
The Zhang et al. [767] mechanism included peroxy radical chem- 
istry, deriving the core reaction classes and rate parameters from 
cyclopentane  [793]  with  modiﬁcations  to  account  for  bond  en- 
ergy  differences.  High-pressure-limit  rates  were  calculated  for 
˙ R + O 
2 → cyclopentenone + HO ˙ O for both isomers from 500 – 20 0 0 
K (cf. Figure 63 ). The chemical kinetics simulations indicated that, 
in addition to HOO-elimination, cyclic ether formation is compet- 
2 -addition and with  ˙ Q OOH-ring-opening reac- 
itive with second-O 
tions. However, no speciation data for the cyclic ethers are avail- 
able  and  the  isomeric  branching for  cyclic  ether  formation  from 
˙ Q OOH radicals of cyclopentanone remains unknown. 

Three  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  exist  for  cyclohexanone 
oxidation:  Serinyel  et  al.  [744] ,  Thion  et  al.  [743] ,  and  He  et  al. 
[786] .  The  last  is  built  from  the  ﬁrst-generation  mechanism  of 
Serinyel et al. [744] and utilizes high-temperature shock tube ig- 
nition  for  assessing  performance.  Thion  et  al.  [743]  revised  the 
ﬁrst-generation  mechanism  of  Serinyel  et  al.  [744]  by  includ-

H-abstraction from cyclohexanone by  ˙ H ,  ˙ O H, and  ˙CH

merization and decomposition of initial α, β, and γ radicals. While 
the formation of β radicals remains the most favorable from 500 
– 10 0 0 K, the direct calculations for H-abstraction in Thion et al. 
[743] affected predictions of branching fractions of initial radicals 
compared to [744] ( Figure 69 ). 

2 → alkene + HO ˙ O  and  exclude

Oxidation  reactions  of  initial  radicals  are  limited  in  both 
cyclohexanone  mechanisms  [ 743 ,  744 ],  which  contain  only 
˙ R + O 
˙ Q OOH-mediated  reactions. 
While both conjugate alkenes cyclohex-2-en-1-one and cyclohex- 
3-en-1-one are included in the two mechanisms, only the former 
was detected in the experiments of Thion et al. [743] and Serinyel 
et al. [744] . Despite being an important intermediate below 10 0 0 
K,  model-predicted  species  proﬁles  of  cyclohex-2-en-1-one  were 
inconsistent with experimental proﬁles. The discrepancies may in- 
dicate deﬁciency in the sub-mechanism, which only includes ab- 
straction reactions forming an allylic-type radical using rate coef- 
ﬁcients from Battin-Leclerc et al. [99] , and subsequent unimolecu- 
lar decomposition into species such as acetylene, ethene, and CO. 
Serinyel et al. [744] included one additional reaction:  ˙ O H-addition 
to cyclohex-2-en-1-one using rate parameters from Heyberger et 
al.  [794]  for  ˙ O H + propene.  ˙ O H-addition  reactions  were  not  in- 
cluded  for  cyclohex-3-en-1-one.  Unimolecular  loss  of  H 
2  and  C–
H β-scission reactions from cyclohexanone were also included, yet 
are not relevant below 10 0 0 K. Other reactions, which are relevant 
to low-temperature chemistry, such as  ˙ Q OOH → cyclic ether + ˙ O H, 
were  excluded  in  both  mechanisms.  The  MPIMS  experiments  of 
Scheer  et  al.  [757]  on  cyclohexanone,  which  were  reported  sub- 
sequent to the Serinyel et al. [ 743 , 744 ] mechanism, observed ion 
signal at the mass-to-charge ratio ( m/z 112) corresponding to cyclic 
ether products, yet isomers were not identiﬁed. Cyclic ether for- 
mation in cyclohexanone oxidation is likely, given the detection of 
similar species in both cyclohexane [ 522 , 795 ] and in cyclohexene 
oxidation [796] . 

3.3.5. Summary of ketone functional group effects 

The  carbonyl  functional  group  creates  distinct  hydrogen- 
abstraction  sites  in  ketone  biofuels,  two  of  which  introduce 
resonance-stabilization in subsequent ketonyl radicals, and the po- 
tential for pre-reaction complex formation in the initiation reac- 
tions with  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O . Because of resonance stabilization, and 
depending on the type of carbon (primary, secondary, or tertiary), 
C–H bond energies are lower by 5-10 kcal/mol compared to alka- 
nes. For O 
2 -addition to resonance-stabilized ketonyl radicals, per- 
oxy  radical  well  depths  are  ∼15  kcal/mol  higher  in  energy  due 
to the loss of resonance. Reactions of resonance-stabilized  ˙ R and 
˙ Q OOH  radicals  – in  particular,  the  competition  between  C–C  β- 
scission and reaction with O 
2  – is the main distinguishing char- 
acteristic governing chain-branching reactions in ketone oxidation. 
In  ˙ O H-initiated H-abstraction reactions from acyclic ketones, α
radicals (adjacent to carbonyl group) are formed via direct abstrac- 
tion while β radicals are produced via pre-reaction complexes and 
are  competitive  below  ∼700  K.  Reactions  at  other  sites  that  are 
further from the carbonyl group ( γ , δ, …) undergo only direct ab- 
straction. In contrast to  ˙ O H, where hydrogen-bonded pre-reaction 
complexes occur primarily at β carbon, such complexes are sig- 
niﬁcant  in  the  majority  of  HO ˙ O -initiated  H-abstraction  reactions 
from ketones. For  ˙ O H-initiated H-abstraction from cyclopentanone, 
branching fractions are weakly temperature dependent and β rad- 
icals are favored over α radicals ( β ∼0.6 versus α ∼0.4 at 500 K 
and β ∼0.7 versus α ∼0.3 at 10 0 0 K). Similar results are reported 
for cyclohexanone in that β radicals are favored and all abstraction 
sites are important. Abstraction from α and γ carbon vary from 
0.2 – 0.3 from 500 – 1000 K. On a per-H-atom basis, for cyclic ke- 
tones, rate coeﬃcients for H-abstraction from β carbon are similar 
among the computational studies to within ∼30%, yet are lower 
than analogous reactions in alkanes because of the effects of hy- 
drogen bonding in the pre-reaction complex lowering the rate of 
abstraction from α carbon. 

Several  reaction  mechanisms  that  are  relevant  to  chain- 
branching chemistry and characteristic of ketones are reported: (i) 
OH-loss from γ -ketohydroperoxide via O–O bond-scission is poten- 
tially facilitated by the ketone group, given that the decomposi- 
tion pathway involves production of a resonance-stabilized radical; 
(ii) alternative unimolecular decomposition pathways of  ˙ Q OOH in- 
cluding a water-elimination reaction, via a mechanism similar to

Fig. 70.  Summary of ketone functional group effects on low-temperature chain-branching. The leftward-pointing and downward-pointing arrows indicate a shift in ﬂux away 
from chain-branching pathways responsible for ignition. Vinoxylic resonance stabilization reduces the reactivity of α- radicals and the corresponding lower exothermicity of 
RO ˙ O formation inhibits the transformations required to proceed towards chain branching. For oxidation with initial radical sites farther removed from the carbonyl group, 
vinoxylic resonance can stabilize  ˙ Q OOH or other intermediates, changing the thermochemistry of isomerization steps. Each type of initial radical is depicted in a separate 
plane, with different colors used as a guide. The alkane oxidation mechanism is depicted in the back plane for reference. Pathways that are enhanced by the effects of the 
functional group are emphasized with bold arrows and labels, and those that are diminished are made lighter or omitted.

radicals occurring in methyl iso -butyl ketone oxidation). Figure 70 
shows the low-temperature chain-branching scheme augmented to 
emphasize  pathways  that  diminish  chain-branching and  that  are 
enhanced by the ketone functional group. 

3.4. Acyclic ethers 

Figure  71  depicts  the  molecular  structure  and  site-labeling 
nomenclature  for  three  representative  acyclic  ethers:  dimethyl 
ether, diethyl ether, and iso -propyl methyl ether. The ether group 
lowers C–H bond dissociation energies on α carbon due to hyper- 
conjugation in the resultant radical between the lone-pair orbital 
of the oxygen atom and the singly-occupied orbital of the carbon 
atom – the lone pair on the –O– group delocalizes to adjacent C–
H antibonding orbitals, weakening C–H bond energy on α carbon. 

Cai et al. [797] utilized G4 and CBS-QB3 methods to calculate bond 
energies of di- n -butyl ether, which differed consistently from one 
another by ∼1.5 kcal/mol. C–H bond energies for the latter method 
were 95.0, 100.0, 96.7, and 101.2 kcal/mol for α, β, γ , and δ sites. 
Similar  results  were  produced  by  Thion  et  al.  [798]  using  G3B3 
with the exception of the γ site (98.8 kcal/mol) that differed by 
2.1 kcal/mol. The main inﬂuence of the ether group is a reduction 
of C–H bond energy on α carbon by ∼3.5 kcal/mol compared to 
secondary carbon on alkanes. 

Polyethers  are  potential  biofuels  [799-805] .  The  ether  func- 
tional  group  is  repeated  in  poly(oxymethylene)  dimethyl  ethers 
( Figure 71 d), the simplest example of which is dimethoxymethane 
(DMM) [806] shown in Figure 71 e. The reactions of such polyethers 
share  some  chemical  characteristics  with  reactions  of  dimethyl 
ether  [807-809] .  However,  Vermeire  et  al.  [810]  note  some 
differences.  Kopp  et  al.  [808]  report  a  C–H  bond  energy  of 
95.67 kcal/mol for the terminal methyl groups in DMM and slightly 
higher  (96.01  kcal/mol)  for  the  central  methylene  group  (at  the 
CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(D + T)Z//B2PLYPD3BJ/6-311 ++ g( d , p ) level). 

The sections below are separated into the following areas: (1) 
initiation  reactions,  RH + ˙ X →  ˙ R + HX,  (2)  reactions  of  linear  rad- 
2 ,  including  methoxymethyl  and  diethyl  ether  radi- 
icals  with  O

The complex provides 4 – 9 kcal/mol of stabilization, depending 
again on the level theory applied. In contrast, transition states lo- 
cated for in-plane, direct abstraction ( Figure 73 c) lie above the en- 
trance  channel  by  approximately  3  – 4  kcal/mol  [ 816 ,  817 ,  819 , 
820 , 823 , 824 ] Bänsch et al. [825] identiﬁed transition states con- 
necting  to  both  the  out-of-plane  and  in-plane  transition  states 
using both CCSD(T)/cc-pV(T,Q)Z//MP2/6-311G( d,p ) and CCSD(T)/cc- 
pV(T,Q)Z//CCSD/cc-pVDZ levels of theory. A third method applied, 
CBS-QB3, did not locate an in-plane transition state and some vari- 
ability amongst the different methods in predicting transition state 
geometries was noted [825] . Calculated branching fractions [ 816 , 
817 , 819 , 820 , 822-824 ], show more than 90% of radicals formed 
by abstraction via the out-of-plane transition state below 500 K. 

The  respective  geometries  of  the  out-of-plane  and  in-plane 
transition states, calculated at various levels of theory, are largely 
similar  [ 816 ,  817 ,  819 ,  820 ,  823-825 ].  To  explain  the  reason  for 
lower barrier height of the out-of-plane transition state Zhou et 
al. [823] noted an inverse relationship between the barrier height 
and length of the C–O bond (on the abstraction site) in the tran- 
sition state: longer C–O bond length being consistent with a lower 
barrier height. Zhou et al. [823] also remarked on the C–H bond 
energy being lower for out-of-plane H atoms as a means of ex- 
plaining the lower barrier height. However, no energy differences 
were reported and bond lengths differed by only 0.019  ˚A. Bottoni 
et al. [816] conducted an extensive series of calculations on tran- 
sition  state  geometries  and  potential  energy  surfaces  using  nine 
combinations of functionals and basis sets. The results in [816] and 
in  other  studies  [ 817 ,  820 ]  point  to  appreciable  dependence  on 
method, which provides a plausible explanation of the aforemen- 
tioned differences in the barrier heights.

El-Nahas  et  al.  [820] ,  Zavala-Oseguera  et  al.  [822] ,  and  Zhou  et 
al. [823] . The temperature dependence for in-plane abstraction is 
positive while out-of-plane pathways, which proceed via formation 
of a reactant complex (c.f. Figure 73 a), follow negative temperature 
dependence  [ 819 ,  820 ,  822 ,  823 ,  825 ],  as  evident  in  branching 
fraction  calculations  in  Figure  74 b.  Out-of-plane  abstraction  is 
predicted to be the dominant branching channel at temperatures 
below 10 0 0 K, with the exception of the lower level results from 
[820] , because of the reaction complex [ 819 , 820 , 822 , 823 ], which 
lowers the barrier height.

3.4.1. Initiation reactions and branching fractions 

Because  of  the  importance  of  ether  oxidation  in  atmospheric 
chemistry, numerous studies of initiation reactions exist at lower 
temperature  and  are  useful  in  connecting  to  other,  higher- 
temperature measurements in cases where there is an inﬂection in 
temperature due to the formation of pre-reaction complexes. Rate 
coeﬃcients for abstraction reactions above 300 K involving  ˙OH and 
linear  ethers  are  reported  for  dimethyl  ether  [ 750 ,  811-826 ], di- 
ethyl ether [ 812 , 813 , 815 , 821 , 822 , 826-828 ], and several other 
ethers [ 803 , 813 , 815 , 821-823 , 827-833 ] using both experimental 
and computational methods.

consistent with the experimental results. Ogura et al. [821] con- 
cluded  using  ab  initio  calculations  on  a  range  of  ethers  that 
the presence of an ether group lowers the barrier height to ab- 
straction  by  3  – 4  kcal/mol  relative  to  alkanes.  Rate  coeﬃcients 
from  OH  laser-induced  ﬂuorescence  experiments  measured  in 
Bänsch et al. [825] were convolved with the majority of literature 
measurements,  which  produced  the  rate  coeﬃcient  of  modiﬁed

Reactions  of  poly(oxymethylene)  methyl  ethers  with  ˙ O H  may 
be  expected  to  follow  similar  behavior.  The  reaction  with 
dimethoxymethane shows a negative temperature dependence at 
low temperature in experimental determinations from Porter et al. 
[838] and Wallington et al. [832] ; at higher temperature there is 
a disagreement between the results of Vovelle et al. [833] , which 
show  a  turn  towards  a  positive  temperature  dependence  above 
∼350  K,  and  the  measurements  of  Bänsch  and  Olzmann  [803] , 
which show a continued weak negative temperature dependence 
over the range covered (297 – 570 K). Theory (CCSD(T)-F12a/aug- 
cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/def2-TZVP)  by  He  et  al.  [839]  shows  an  initial 
reactant complex in the  ˙ O H + DMM reaction that can connect to 
abstraction over submerged barriers at either the terminal or cen- 
tral  carbon.  As  in  dimethyl  ether,  a  product  complex  also  exists

sures  are  covered:  25  – 720  Torr.  Negative  temperature  depen- 
dence is exhibited starting from the lower extremum of the mea- 
surements, 230 K [813] , up to approximately 400 K as evident in 
5 + ˙OH in Ogura et al. 
[815] . The ab initio calculations of C 
[821] and Zavala-Oseguera et al.  [822] support the experimental 
results. Notably, hydrogen-bonded pre-reaction and product com- 
plexes were included in [822] , yet in [821] direct and indirect tran- 
sition states were not considered. Branching fractions calculated in 
Zavala-Oseguera et al. [822] – at 400 K, the highest temperature 
for which branching fractions were reported – indicate that > 90% 
of abstraction occurs from α carbon in diethyl ether, due largely 
to the 3 – 5 kcal/mol lower C–H bond energy caused by the prox- 
imity to the ether group. However, branching fractions calculated 
from  the  group  rate  expressions  in  Ogura  et  al.  [821]  suggest  a 
more competitive reaction, where α radicals range from 40 – 60% 
up to 10 0 0 K. Figure 75 compares rate coeﬃcients determined us- 
ing group rate expressions for  ˙ O H + diethyl ether from Ogura et al. 
[821] against  ˙ O H + n -pentane from Sivaramakrishnan et al. [841] , 
showing that H-abstraction is approximately a factor of ∼2 higher 
from diethyl ether from 50 0 – 10 0 0 K. 

For H-abstraction by  ˙OH from branched ethers, including di- iso - 
propyl ether [ 813 , 821 , 826 ], ethyl tert -butyl ether [ 815 , 821 , 829 ],

propyl substituents in ethers such as di- iso -propyl ether [ 813 , 821 ,

˙OH + diethyl ether favor α radicals by more than 90% at the peak 
temperature  considered,  400  K.  Similarly,  at  the  same  tempera- 
ture,  ˙OH + iso -butyl  methyl  ether  favors  abstraction  at  the  (sec- 
ondary) α(cid:9) carbon with a branching fraction of ∼45%, compared to 
∼10% from the α carbon on the opposite side of the ether group 
2 ˙C–O–). The tert -butyl substituent does not support the com- 
(i.e. H 
plex formation that leads to negative temperature dependence, ev- 
idenced  by  the  comparison  of  methyl  tert -butyl  ether  to  that  of 
ethyl tert -butyl ether – the latter displays d k /dT < 0 due to the 
ethyl group [829] .

Fig. 76.  Rate coeﬃcients calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory in Zhou et 
al. [823] for  ˙OH + linear and branched ethers. Negative temperature dependence is 
evident in iso -propyl methyl ether up to ∼800 K and up to ∼600 K in ethyl methyl 
ether due to the formation of a pre-reaction complex, while positive temperature 
dependence is exhibited for dimethyl ether + ˙OH. 

tive complex formation for  ˙OH + methyl iso -propyl ether was re- 
ported in Zhou et al. [823] , which is consistent with the negative 
temperature dependence observed experimentally [815] and likely 
explains similar behavior in  ˙OH + di- iso -propyl ether [ 813 , 826 ]. 

In contrast, the quaternary carbon that is present on tert -butyl 
substituents  in  ethers  restricts  the  formation  of  a  pre-reaction 
complex, leading to positive temperature dependence of the rate 
coeﬃcient methyl tert -butyl ether + ˙OH [ 814 , 815 , 817 , 818 , 822 ], 
and  is  the  principal  reason  for  inhibition  of  chain-branching  re- 
actions that require  ˙ Q OOH formation and subsequent second O 
2 - 
addition. Tranter and Walker [815] conducted rate coeﬃcient mea- 
surements for H-abstraction by  ˙H and  ˙OH, in addition to speciation 
of reaction products from methyl- and ethyl- tert -butyl ether oxida- 
tion. 

Zhou  et  al.  [823]  conducted  a  series  of  calculations  on 
dimethyl  ether,  ethyl  methyl  ether,  and  iso -propyl  methyl  ether 
to  examine  the  inﬂuence  of  branched  substituents  on  k (T)  for 
˙OH + ether → ˙ R + H 
2 O ( Figure 76 ). Branching ratios were reported, 
and in the latter two cases abstraction of hydrogen on tertiary car- 
bon – forming α radicals – were favored at temperatures below 
10 0 0  K.  Similarly,  Zavala-Oseguera  et  al.  [822]  conducted  a  sys- 
tematic series of computations wherein substituents were varied 
from dimethyl ether to n -propyl methyl ether, and in branched sys- 
tems from iso -propyl methyl ether to iso -butyl methyl ether and 
methyl tert -butyl ether, concluding that abstraction dominated at 
the carbon atom located α to the ether group on the side with 
the larger alkyl substituent. For example, branching fractions from

culated  rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction  by  HO ˙O  from  ethers 
above  300  K,  and  no  measurements  are  reported  in  the  litera-

ing corrections. Site-speciﬁc and overall rate coeﬃcients were re- 
ported.  Using  MP2-based  functionals  with  the  6-311G( d,p )  basis 
set for geometry optimization and frequency calculations, and the 
CCSD(T) coupled cluster method for energy calculations, Mendes 
et  al.  [77]  assessed  the  effects  of  linear  and  branched  sub- 
stituents,  ranging  from  methyl  to  butyl.  Reactions  of  HO ˙O  with

ether (CH

5 ), n -propyl methyl ether (CH

3 OC 
methyl ether (CH 
and  iso -butyl  methyl  ether  (CH 
2 ).  Similar  to  reac- 
tions with  ˙OH, reactant and product complexes were identiﬁed in 
the entrance and exit channels on all of the potential energy sur- 
faces, most of which involved hydrogen bonding between the –O–
group and the H atom of HO ˙O. In all cases, branching fraction cal- 
culations revealed that reactions occur predominantly at α and α’ 
sites, where the latter designates the methyl substituent and α is 
either 1 °, 2 °, or 3 ° depending on the nature of the substituent. Be- 
low 10 0 0 K, abstraction from α and α’ sites combined to account 
2 + ˙ R , 
for over 90% of initial radical production via HO ˙O + RH → H 
with the α site favored – remaining above ∼60%. The inﬂuence of 
the ether group in such reactions is negligible for β, γ , and δ sites. 
Moreover, rate coeﬃcients for abstraction at α sites were approxi- 
mately 10 2 higher than for corresponding sites in alkanes, and sev- 
eral orders of magnitude higher than the analogous site in ketones 
and esters [77] .

3.4.2. Reactions of initial radicals with O 2 

Initiation reactions described above, involving  ˙OH, HO ˙O, or  ˙CH 

3 , 
yield the initial ether radicals with which O 
2 reacts. Figure 77 de- 
picts relevant pathways considered in the literature for the sim- 
plest acyclic ether, dimethyl ether. Other, more structurally com- 
plex  ethers  follow  similar  general  schemes  although  with  ad- 
ditional  pathways  to,  for  example,  cyclic  ether + ˙OH  in  chain- 
propagating  steps.  The  balance  among  the  competing  pathways 
for  ether  radicals  is  responsible  for  the  differences  in  autoigni- 
tion  chemistry.  Connecting  product  formation  to  initial  radicals 
with O 
2  is therefore a critical step to enable quantitative chem- 
ical kinetics modeling. Two critical steps for chain-branching are 
isomerization reactions RO ˙O → ˙ Q OOH and  ˙OOQOOH → HOO ˙ P OOH, 
which  may  also  play  a  role  in  tropospheric  oxidation,  as  com- 
puted  by Wang  and Wang  [851] .  Results  from  experimental  and 
computational  studies  for  several  ethers  are  described  in  detail 
in the ensuing sections in relation to the pathways in Figure 77 . 
For dimethyl ether, the main aspects of low-temperature oxidation 
2 -addition is favored over  ˙ Q OOH → products due 
are: (1) second-O 
to high barriers for cyclic ether formation and since no conjugate 
alkene + HO ˙ O  pathways  are  available;  (2)  the  pathway  to  formic 
acid + Criegee intermediate, Channel I, is unconﬁrmed since no de- 
2 O ˙ O ) is reported; (3) formic an- 
tection of formaldehyde oxide ( ˙CH 
hydride  (CHO(–O–)CHO),  formed  via  Channel  II,  was  detected  in 
JSR experiments of Moshammer et al. [344] ; (4) formic acid may 
arise  from  several  competing  pathways,  including  via  hydroper- 
oxymethyl  formate  (Channels  I,  II,  II,  and  V),  from  reaction  of 
formaldehyde  with  ˙ O H,  or  via  secondary  chemistry  initiated  by 
HO ˙O + formaldehyde; and (5) performic acid, formed via Channel 
IV, was detected in Moshammer et al. [852] , despite a high bar-

rier on the potential energy surface for hydroperoxymethyl formate 
[853] .

3.4.2.1. Methoxymethyl + O 2 .  Dimethyl ether oxidation presents an 
apparent simplicity: upon H-abstraction, dimethyl ether yields one 
radical isomer (methoxymethyl, H 
3 ), which can add to O 
2 
and form one peroxy radical (methoxymethyl-peroxy, RO ˙ O ), which 
can isomerize to one hydroperoxy-substituted radical (hydroperox- 
ymethoxymethyl,  ˙ Q OOH).  The  reaction  of  the  latter  radical  with 
2 leads to the formation of the lone γ -ketohydroperoxide isomer 
O 
from  dimethyl  ether,  hydroperoxymethyl  formate.  However,  sev- 
eral alternative reaction pathways exist, as proposed in Andersen 
and Carter [853] as part of a series of computational studies on 
chain-propagation  and  chain-branching  kinetics  and  mechanisms 
of dimethyl ether oxidation ( Figure 77 ): Criegee channel (I), dehy- 
dration channel (II), alternative chain-branching channel (V), per- 
formic acid channel (IV). 
Reaction  of  ˙CH

rectly  to  CH 
a  collisionally  stabilized  peroxy  radical  (adduct-stabilized  chan- 
nel).  The  latter  may  subsequently  undergo  isomerization  via 
2  ( ˙ Q OOH)  and  dissociate,  leading  to 
˙OOCH 
the same, yet  ˙ Q OOH-mediated, set of products. The two channels

Rosado-Reyes and Francisco [858] employed time-dependent IR-

ing the pressure- and temperature-dependence of branching frac- 
tions in the  ˙CH

tion,  evident  from  an  abrupt  rise  in  IR-absorption  signal  near 
time-zero, exhibited inverse pressure dependence. Sehested et al. 
[859] expanded the conditions used in [858] to higher pressures, 
conducting  experiments  from  10 –2  – 18  atm  and  from  296  –
473  K.  The  measurements  revealed  a  weak  dependence  on  both 
pressure and temperature, consistent with Hoyermann and Nacke

the temperature at which the formaldehyde channel and reverse

[859] ( ∼20 – 760 Torr), and Maricq et al. [857] (5 – 690 Torr). ‘Raw’ refers to calcu- 
lations using the DFT/ B3LYP//6-311G ∗ ∗ values [866] and ‘adjusted’ calculations have 
the R–O ˙ O bond dissociation enthalpy changed to agree with Curran et al. [848] . 

[866]  remarked  that  the  DFT-B3LYP//6-311G ∗∗ calculations  could 
lead  to  artiﬁcially  lower  bond  dissociation  energies,  and  so  also 
carried out calculations with bond enthalpy parameters adjusted 
to  match  thermochemistry  from  Curran  et  al.  [ 848 ,  867 ].  Figure 
79 compares the calculations in Andersen and Carter [866] with 
the experimental results from Maricq et al. [857] , Sehested et al. 
[859] , and Hoyermann et al. [860] . Despite the state-resolved varia- 
tional treatment, the rate coeﬃcient for the forward reaction, even 
after  adjusting  the  bond  enthalpy,  is  higher  than  experimental 
rate coeﬃcients [ 857 , 859 , 860 ]. The discrepancies were ascribed 
partly to an incomplete description of the bond-breaking mecha- 
nism, particularly the bending motion orthogonal to the reaction 
coordinate, and interactions between excited-state O 
2 and neutral 
methoxymethyl and ionic [methoxymethyl] + + O 
2 – [866] ; the latter 
interaction was invoked by Ruiz and Bayes [868] in rate coeﬃcient 
measurements of n -propyl and iso -propyl with O

Product formation and reaction kinetics involving collisionally 
stabilized ether-peroxy radicals were examined in both computa- 
tional and experimental studies [ 853 , 854 , 856 , 858 , 863 , 866 , 869- 
871 ], which provide clarity on the oxidation mechanism depicted 
in Figure 77 . Unimolecular reactions of RO ˙O involve either back- 
dissociation to  ˙ R + O

propagation or chain-branching mechanisms.

Yamada et al. [862] found at the CBS-q/MP2//6-31G( d,p ) level

of theory that the isomerization step  ˙OOCH

encounters  a  barrier  of  ∼16  kcal/mol.  Canonical  transition  state 
theory was used to calculate rate coeﬃcients in the high-pressure 
limit.  Rodriguez  et  al.  [872]  derived  a  similar  expression  using 
stationary points calculated with the G4 composite method. An- 
dersen and Carter [866] applied canonical transition state theory 
to  stationary  points  from  DFT-B3LYP//6-311G ∗∗ calculations  that 
give a signiﬁcantly higher barrier to isomerization. The results dif-

˙ Q OOH → CH 
2 O + ˙OH is not in the high-pressure limit at 40 
atm above 500 K, and the authors remarked on the need to ac- 
count  for  such  pressure-dependence  in  combustion  modeling.  In 
contrast with Yamada et al. [862] and Curran et al. [848] , Ander- 
sen and Carter [866] ﬁnd that breaking the O–OH bond in  ˙ Q OOH, 
rather than β-scission to produce formaldehyde, is the transition 
2 O and  ˙OH. However, Eskola et al. [863] ( vide 
state to forming 2 CH 
2 OOH 
infra )  demonstrated  that  the  transition  states  for  H 
decomposition show signiﬁcant multireference character and dif- 
ferent  methods  yield  dramatically  different  energies  (by  nearly 
10 kcal/mol), compelling caution when evaluating such reactions. 
Even  with  the  uncertainty,  in  the  case  of  dimethyl  ether  oxida- 
2 O + ˙OH or 
tion, the two major channels for  ˙ Q OOH are CH 
2 -addition to form  ˙OOQOOH radicals [ 863 , 864 , 872 ]. In 
second-O 
the case of the latter, isomerization via a 6-membered transition 
state,  leads  to  HOO ˙ P OOH,  the  decomposition  of  which  gives  the 
lone γ -ketohydroperoxide isomer of dimethyl ether, hydroperox- 
ymethyl formate.

Addition  of  ˙ Q OOH  to  a  second  O 

2  is  barrierless.  Andersen 
and  Carter  [866]  calculated  a  high-pressure  limit  for  the  addi- 
tion of k ( T ) = 2.69 • 10 12 • T 0.5 cm 3 mol –1 s –1 by applying canoni- 
cal transition state theory to stationary points from DFT/B3LYP//6- 
311G ∗∗. A benchmark temperature of 600 K was used to compare 
with Curran et al. [848] , because this was the peak temperature 
where formic acid, formed via chain-branching, was observed in 
[848] and in Liu et al. [874] . Curran et al. [848] estimated k (600 K) 
of 7.00 • 10 11 cm 3 mol –1 s -1 to reach agreement with experimental 
yields. The rate coeﬃcient calculated in [866] is approximately 10 2 
higher than [848] , and the difference ascribed to the same issue 
that occurred for  ˙ R + O 
2 reactions: inadequate description by DFT 
methods because of multi-reference contributions. Further reﬁne- 
ments by [866] , employing variational RRKM, reduced the discrep- 
ancy  yet  the  value  remained  more  than  10 1  higher  than  Curran 
et al. [848] , leading the authors in [866] to remark on the need 
for more-accurate portrayal of the relevant PES and of the bending 
potential involved in the reaction. 

Once  ˙OOQOOH is formed, the next step in the sequence lead- 
ing  to  chain-branching  is  isomerization  to  HOO ˙ P OOH,  for  which 
reverse reaction is negligible in the temperature range where low- 
temperature chain branching is prevalent: 500 – 700 K. Some dis- 
crepancies  in  k (T)  were  noted  in  [866] .  The  Curran  et  al.  esti- 
mate [848] of 4.00 • 10 10 exp(–18.6/RT) s –1  differs by more than 
10 1  at 600 K compared to Andersen and Carter [866] : 2.32 10 11 
T 0.81 exp(–22.9/RT) s –1 gives 1.88 • 10 5 s –1 [866] . The large differ- 
ences  in  A -factor  (up  to  10 3 )  and  in  E a  (up  to  7  kcal/mol)  sug- 
gested that further computational studies are required to provide 
more  precise  constraints.  Wang  and  Wang  [851]  found  a  lower 
˙OOQOOH → HOO ˙ P OOH  isomerization  barrier  (21.2  kcal  mol −1  by 
UCBS-QB3) than the Andersen and Carter B3LYP/6-311G( d , p ) value 
of 22.7 kJ mol −1 [866] . Scission of the O–O bond adjacent to the 
carbon  radical  center  is  accepted  as  the  sole  fate  of  HOO ˙ P OOH 
and  gives  hydroperoxymethyl  formate + ˙OH  as  products.  Born- 
Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations by Ander- 
sen and Carter [871] found that O–O bond-scission in HOO ˙ P OOH 
occurs within 500 fs. 

The  chain-branching  step  in  dimethyl  ether  oxidation  occurs 
from  the  production  of  additional  radicals  from  the  decomposi- 
tion of hydroperoxymethyl formate, for which several channels are 
possible [853] ( Figure 77 ). In addition, the detection of formic an- 
hydride (via the non-chain branching Channel II in Figure 77 ) in 
hydroperoxymethyl formate decomposition [875] raises the poten- 
tial for acid-catalyzed dehydration reactions. Channel V is a chain- 
branching  pathway  alternative  to  the  O–O  bond-scission  path- 
way considered the primary decomposition channel for hydroper- 
oxymethyl  formate,  producing  formic  acid + H ˙CO + ˙OH  are  giving

lated to low-frequency modes and mode-mixing. Wang and Wang

tions  for  the  internal-hydrogen-transfer-isomerization  of  peroxy

on M06-2X/6-311 ++ G(2 df ,2 p ) structures and treating internal ro- 
tations as hindered rotors using M06-2X calculations of the tor- 
sional potential. Wang and Wang concentrated on lower tempera- 
tures (233 – 343 K) for tropospheric applications and yielded high- 
pressure limit results (3.10 • 10 7 exp(–5903/T) s -1 ) that are higher 
than an extrapolation of the results of Yamada et al. [862] or Ro- 
driguez et al. [872] , which may partially reﬂect tunneling effects 
[851] . The extrapolated results from Andersen and Carter [866] are 
lower  still  because  of  the  higher  isomerization  barrier  in  the 
B3LYP calculations [870] . Figure 80 compares the methoxymethyl-

In principle, the formation of  ˙ Q OOH radicals can lead to cyclic 
ether  formation  (oxirane + HO ˙O  or  1,3-dioxetane + ˙OH;  pathways 
VII and VIII in Figure 77 ); Moshammer et al. [852] experimentally 
identiﬁed  1,3-dioxetane  in  JSR  measurements  of  dimethyl  ether 
oxidation. The ether group opens another decomposition channel 
via  β-scission  to  CH 
2 O + ˙OH.  Yamada  et  al.  [862]  found 
the  decomposition  step  to  be  the  primary  unimolecular  channel 
for the  ˙ Q OOH species and predicted that formation of the cyclic 
ether  1,3-dioxetane  is  unimportant  with  a  CBS-q  barrier  height 
being nearly 8 kcal/mol higher. Pressure-dependent formaldehyde 
yields  were  calculated  and  a  3.3  kcal/mol  reduction  in  barrier 
height for decomposition (to 21.4 kcal/mol) was required to match 
formaldehyde yields measured in photolytically initiated oxidation 
experiments  of  Sehested  et  al.  [873] ,  suggesting  that  the  CBS- 
q  barriers  could  be  uncertain  by  ∼3.5  kcal/mol  [862] .  Similarly, 
Andersen  and  Carter  [866]  focused  on  the  decomposition  reac-

Subsequent pulsed photolysis experiments and potential energy 
surface calculations in Suzaki et al. [ 854 , 869 ] extended the insight 
into the oxidation mechanism of dimethyl ether using a frequency- 
modulated near-infrared (FM-NIR) absorption spectroscopy for di- 
rect  measurements  of  ˙OH  and  HO ˙O  time  histories  [ 854 ,  869 ] 
and UV-absorption spectroscopy for direct measurements of HO ˙O, 
H 
3 [869] . The FM-NIR measurements and 
kinetics analysis in [854] conﬁrmed that HO ˙O is not formed di- 
rectly, as a primary product, from  ˙ Q OOH → HO ˙O + oxirane. Instead, 
formaldehyde formed via β-scission of  ˙ Q OOH serves as the precur- 
sor via the production of formyl radical ( ˙OH + CH

followed  by  O 
mental  ˙OH and HO ˙O proﬁles were modeled using a reﬁnement of 
the Curran et al. [867] mechanism; the initial version did not re- 
produce the  ˙OH and HO ˙O time histories despite accurately captur- 
ing ignition delay times [867] . Suzaki et al. [869] later identiﬁed 
an alternative reaction pathway for  ˙ Q OOH decomposition, which 
is 2 – 3 kcal/mol lower than the conventional β-scission pathway 
2 O + ˙OH. The mechanism involves a transition 
yielding CH 
state for an  ˙OH-transfer reaction from the –OOH group to the car- 
bon radical site and forms a hydroxy-alkoxy radical that decom- 
poses into H ˙CO + CH

Eskola et al. [863] conducted LIF experiments to measure  ˙OH 
time histories in dimethyl ether oxidation and master equation cal- 
culations using MESMER to simulate the results. Several important 
details were noted. As noted above, transition states on the ﬁrst- 
O 
2 -addition  potential  energy  surface  displayed  signiﬁcant  multi- 
reference  character,  with  T1  diagnostics  exceeding  0.02,  reveal- 
ing model-chemistry-dependent saddle point energies spanning 6 
kcal/mol for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH and 10 kcal/mol for subsequent  ˙ Q OOH 
decomposition reactions. Rate coeﬃcients were determined at the 
CBS-q//MPW1K/aug-cc-pVTZ  level  of  theory  using  MESMER,  and 
comparisons were drawn against the Curran et al. [848] mecha- 
nism. In the context of autoignition chemistry, two principal dif- 
ferences  were  noted.  For  both  forward  and  reverse  reactions  in 
RO ˙O  (cid:3) ˙ Q OOH, the master  equation analysis in [863]  produced 
rate coeﬃcients 10 1  higher, which impacted the predicted time- 
dependence  of  ˙OOQOOH  – the  radical  precursor  to  the  chain- 
branching agent, hydroperoxy methyl formate.

Product formation from bimolecular reactions in dimethyl ether 
oxidation,  other  than  ˙ R + O 
2  and  related  reactions,  include  stud- 
ies on self-reactions of methoxymethyl-peroxy radicals [856] and 
HO ˙O + H 
3  [855] .  Wallington  et  al.  [855]  applied  Fourier 
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) to measure methoxy hy- 
2 OOH) and methyl formate from reactions of 
droperoxide (H 
HO ˙O with H 
3 at 700 Torr. The experiments were conducted 
at a temperature not directly relevant to combustion (298 K), how- 
ever  a  mechanism  by  which  the  products  are  formed  was  pos- 
tulated. The mechanism for methoxy hydroperoxide formation in- 
volved a 4-membered transition state involving only the terminal 
O  atom  and  the  HO ˙O  reactant.  However,  the  6-membered  tran- 
sition state leading to methyl formate ( + H 
2 ), additionally 
involved  the  secondary  H  atom  on  methoxymethyl-peroxy,  indi- 
cating a potential dependence of the rate coeﬃcient on the type 
of  ˙ R group. Jenkin et al. [856] employed UV-absorption to probe 
the kinetics of the methoxymethyl-peroxy self-reaction and result- 
ing  product  formation  including  methoxy  hydroperoxide,  methyl 
2 OH).  The  latter 
formate,  and  hydroxymethyl  methoxy  (H 
species, assigned an upper limit of 15% of the total yield of prod- 
ucts from self-reaction, is suspected to form via decomposition of 
the R ˙O radicals, although no distinguishing spectral features were 
observed in the infrared spectra. Although not included in the cal- 
culations,  Andersen  and  Carter  [866]  noted  the  potential  impor-

a  connection  to  the  production  of  formic  acid  from  second-O 
2 - 
addition reactions. However, the A -factor for the reaction to formic 
acid + H ˙CO + ˙OH computed in [866] , 1.96 • 10 14  s −1  at 600 K, is 
considerably smaller than that for the simple O–O bond-scission. 
Application of variational RRKM to both reactions in [853] shows 
that bond scission is favored by more than 10 1 at 600 K. Channel I 
is an energetically competitive pathway leading to the production 
of formaldehyde oxide ( ˙CH 
2 O ˙O) – the smallest Criegee intermedi- 
ate. Andersen and Carter [853] suggested that the Criegee inter- 
mediate channel may compete with O–O scission, given that the 
pathway lies 25 kcal/mol below the  ˙ Q OOH + O 
2 entrance channel 
with a barrier height (at B3LYP/6-311G( d , p )) similar to the dissoci- 
ation energy of the O–O bond. However, the kinetics calculations 
in [866] show Criegee intermediate formation as a minor channel. 
Figure 81 compares the unimolecular reaction rate coeﬃcients cal- 
culated for the most favorable dissociation channels in Figure 77 . 
Channel IV – performic acid + CO + H 
2 – is not shown because the 
barrier is more than 20 kcal/mol higher than the other channels. 

Several  groups  report  product  formation  measurements 
methoxymethyl + O 
2  reactions  using  pulsed-photolysis  initiation 
[ 854 , 858 , 863 , 869 ]. Rosado-Reyes and Francisco [858] employed 
both  photolytically-  and  thermally-initiated  experiments  in  con- 
junction  with  transient  IR-absorption  spectroscopy  to  determine 
the  temperature-  and  pressure-dependence  of  the  branching 
fraction  of  ˙ R + O 
2  (cf.  Figure  78 ,  direct  formaldehyde  channel 
versus  the  adduct-stabilized  channel).  Time  proﬁles  of  formic 
acid, formaldehyde, and methyl formate were directly probed over 
the  ﬁrst  900  μs  of  oxidation  at  pressures  from  20  – 200  Torr 
and  temperatures  up  to  600  K.  One  of  the  more  salient  points 
was  the  absence  of  formic  acid  in  the  photolysis  experiments, 
indicating  production  in  the  thermally  initiated  experiments 
arising  from  secondary  reactions  indirectly  related  to  RO ˙O,  e.g. 
HOCH 
2 O  forms  via  a 
reaction  sequence  initiated  by  HO ˙O + formaldehyde.  However, 
formic  acid  was  observed  in  thermally  initiated  experiments  of 
Rosado-Reyes and Francisco [858] , similar to Curran et al. [848] in 
which ﬂow reactor experiments were conducted  using residence 
times of 2 – 4 s. Formaldehyde yields were in the high-pressure 
limit  above  ∼100  Torr  in  [858] ,  indicating  the  dominance  of 
the  adduct-stabilized  channel  at  practical  combustion  pressures, 
and  within  the  900- μs  measurement  time  formaldehyde  was 
suppressed towards the higher pressures used in the experiments. 
Rosado-Reyes and Francisco [858] postulate that the primary fate 
of  RO ˙O  radicals  at  the  high  initial  radical  concentrations  ( > 10 14 
cm –3 )  in  the  experiments  is  not  isomerization  to  ˙ Q OOH,  rather 
self-reaction to yield R ˙O + R ˙O + O

tance of RO ˙O self-reaction in dimethyl ether oxidation at high pres- 
sures due to appreciable stabilization of the adduct at 1 atm – sig- 
niﬁcantly below practical combustion pressures; branching fraction 
calculations  for  methoxymethyl + O 
2  reactions  in  [866]  indicated 
nearly 90% is stabilized RO ˙O at 100 Torr. 

The  functional  group  effects  on  dimethyl  ether  oxidation  are 
also  present  in  the  oxidation  of  poly(oxymethylene)  dimethyl 
ethers such as dimethoxymethane, and chemical kinetics mecha- 
nisms are often built from analogy to dimethyl ether [ 807 , 808 ]. 
Döntgen  et  al.  [876]  collected  the  relevant  thermochemistry  for 
polyether oxidation. He et al. [839] explicitly calculated stationary 
points for the addition of dimethoxymethane radicals to O 
2 , the 
subsequent  isomerization  reactions  of  the  RO ˙O  radicals,  and  de- 
composition  of  ˙ Q OOH  species  at  the  CBS-QB3/B3LYP/CBSB7  level 
of theory, and applied canonical transition state theory with hin- 
dered rotor treatment of torsions to compute rate coeﬃcients for 
the unimolecular reactions. As in the case of dimethyl ether oxi- 
dation, carbonyl formation from the  ˙ Q OOH species competes with 
dissociation to cyclic ethers. 

3.4.2.2. Reactions  of  diethyl  ether  radicals  with  O 2 .  Several  the- 
oretical  studies  focus  on  the  diethyl  ether  oxidation  mecha- 
nisms.  Wang  and  Wang  [851]  calculated  potential  energy  sur- 
faces at M06-2X/6-311 ++ G(2 df ,2 p ) level of theory for isomeriza- 
2 -addition  adducts,  i.e.  RO ˙O → ˙ Q OOH 
tion  of  ﬁrst-  and  second-O 
and  ˙OOQOOH → HOO ˙ P OOH, for diethyl ether, dimethyl ether, and 
di- iso -propyl  ether.  Rate  coeﬃcients  were  calculated  with  RRKM 
theory  using  MESMER  [851] .  Di  Tommaso  et  al.  [877]  em- 
ployed  a  lower  level  of  theory,  B3LYP/6-31 + G( d , p ),  to  calcu- 
late  stationary  points  for  several  types  of  reactions  in  diethyl 
ether  oxidation,  including  peroxy  radicals,  γ -ketohydroperoxide 
(HOOQ’ = O), and hydroperoxide (ROOH) species. On the surface for 
γ -ketohydroperoxide decomposition, transition states and reaction 
enthalpies  were  determined  for  six  pathways,  one  of  which  in- 
volved a highly exothermic dehydration reaction facilitated by the 
–O– group,  leading to acetic acid,  H 
2 ). 
A  similar  dehydration  reaction  was  also  found  on  the  surface 
of  the  secondary  ROOH  species.  Di  Tommaso  et  al.  [878]  subse- 
quently conducted a series of calculations on linear and branched 
ethers,  including  dimethyl  ether,  tert -amyl  methyl  ether,  and  di- 
iso -propyl ether, and compared barrier heights for several reaction 
types against similar reactions in alkanes. The determinations in 
[878] suggest that the barrier height for C–O β-scission is ca. 10 
kcal/mol lower than for analogous dissociations of alkyl radicals, 
and  the  barrier  to  RORO ˙O  isomerization  is  ca.  4  kcal/mol  lower 
than for analogous isomerizations in alkylperoxy radicals. 

2 O, and ketene (O = C = CH 

A  higher  level  study  by  Sakai  et  al.  [879]  employed  varia- 
tional transition state theory for reactions of diethyl ether radicals 
with  O 
2 ,  using  CASPT2(7,5)/aug-cc-pvdz  single-point  calculations 
and UB3LYP/CBSB7 geometries and frequencies for the oxygen as- 
sociation reactions, and conventional transition state theory at the 
CBS-QB3  level  of  theory  for  unimolecular  reactions  of  RO ˙O  and 
˙ Q OOH radicals. The ab  initio  rate coeﬃcients for the ether were 
then compared against rate-rules-derived rate coeﬃcients of anal- 
ogous alkanes. Several differences relevant to low-temperature oxi- 
dation were noted in this comparison. Isomerization rates for RO ˙ O 
(cid:3) ˙ Q OOH were similar, with the exception of the case where the 
peroxy group is located on the α carbon to the ether link and ab- 
straction occurs on the opposite α carbon via a 6-membered tran- 
sition state. For such an isomerization the rate was larger than the 
analogous alkane by a factor of 10 near 700 K. When the peroxy 
group is located on the β carbon, however, the reverse reaction to 
2 is higher by ca. 10 1 at 700 K than analogous alkane. Com- 
˙ R + O 
pared to n -pentane, the rate of cyclic ether + ˙ O H via unimolecu- 
lar  ˙ Q OOH decomposition is higher by ∼10 1 for diethyl ether when 
the radical site is adjacent to the ether group ( Figure 82 a), i.e. the 

Fig. 82.  Rates for  ˙ Q OOH decomposition into oxiranes are facilitated in diethyl ether 
oxidation and are higher by ∼10 1 

than analogous reactions in alkanes. 

Fig. 83.  Decomposition pathways for  ˙ O OQOOH radicals of diethyl ether in Sakai et 
al. [880] affected by the presence of the ether group. (a) E a is 4.3 kcal/mol lower

formation of a substituted oxirane. Spin-contamination corrections 
were noted as a source of error. A transition state was located and 
rate coeﬃcients were calculated for an OH-transfer reaction in β- 
α- ˙ Q OOH radicals with a barrier height only 4 – 5 kcal/mol higher 
than ring-closure forming cyclic ether + ˙ O H; β refers to the loca- 
tion of the peroxy group and α the carbon radical site. 

Subsequently,  Sakai  et  al.  [880]  compiled  a  detailed  chemi- 
cal  kinetics  mechanism  and  revised  rate  coeﬃcients  for  twenty- 
four product channels from second-O 
2 -addition reactions using the 
composite CBS-QB3 level of theory to calculate barrier heights di- 
rectly,  which  were  determined  in  [879]  by  estimation.  The  bar- 
rier heights were largely similar to analogous alkane reactions ex- 
cept for six cases, which are separable into two types depending 
on the position of the –OOH (being α or β relative to the ether 
group), and both types involve entropically disfavored 8-membered 
transition states [880] . In cases where abstraction by the peroxy 
group occurs from the carbon to which the –OOH is bound ( Figure 
83 a), leading ultimately to a ketohydroperoxide isomer, the barrier 
height is 4.3 kcal/mol lower than the analogous reaction in alka- 
nes. In contrast, however, when the –OOH group is in the α posi- 
tion with respect to the ether group, and abstraction by the peroxy 
group occurs at the same (terminal) carbon, Figure 83 b, the barrier 
height is higher by 6.7 kcal/mol. Of the six isomers of  ˙ O OQOOH in 
diethyl ether, four are dominated by a single reaction at temper- 
atures below 10 0 0 K: isomerization to HOO ˙ P OOH. In the remain- 
ing two cases, where the O–O and –OOH are adjacent to one an- 
other, HO ˙O-forming channels either compete or exceed isomeriza- 
tion, in part due to lower C–H bond energy near the ether func- 
tional group. 

Fewer  experimental  studies  exist  on  product  formation  from 
photolytically  initiated  ˙ R + O 
2  reactions  in  diethyl  ether  than  for 
dimethyl  ether.  Orlando  [881]  carried  out Cl-atom-initiated  oxi- 
dation  experiments  on  diethyl  ether  from  50  – 700  Torr,  where 
60  – 80%  of  the  initial  radicals  led  to  the  production  of  either 
ethyl formate or ethyl acetate. However, the experiments were con- 
ducted from 218 – 335 K, below combustion-relevant temperatures 
and where the role of radical-radical chemistry increases. Recently, 
Demireva et al. [882] used synchrotron photoionization mass spec- 
trometry to measure both stable products and peroxy radical in- 
termediates RO ˙O and  ˙OOQOOH in the Cl-initiated oxidation of di- 
ethyl ether at pressures up to 10 bar and temperatures from 450 –
600 K. Demireva et al. [882] employed carbon balance in controlled 
experiments to deduce photoionization cross-sections for the per- 
oxy radical intermediates, allowing for quantiﬁcation for the ﬁrst

time. Demireva et al. [882] observe that increasing temperature re- 
duces yields of  ˙OOQOOH and KHP and increases acetaldehyde and 
RO ˙O, because thermal dissociation of  ˙ Q OOH increasingly competes 
with second O 
2  addition; an additional observation was that in- 
creased stabilization at higher pressure tends to increase KHP and 
˙OOQOOH yields. 

3.4.2.3. Reactions of branched ether radicals with O 2 .  Direct kinetics 
studies of peroxy radicals formed from branched ethers are lim- 
ited. The MPIMS experiments on ethyl tert -butyl ether oxidation 
in  Winfough  et  al.  [883] ,  conducted  from  550  – 700  K  at  pres- 
sures near 10 Torr, revealed that the favored reaction mechanism is 
the decomposition of the initial β radical on the tert -butyl group 
leading  to  iso -butene + acetaldehyde  – the  most  abundant  set  of 
products quantiﬁed. Similarly, δ- ˙ Q OOH radicals where the  –OOH 
is located on the tert -butyl group also led to iso -butene and ac- 
etaldehyde (formed coincident with HO ˙O). No cyclic ethers were 
observed in [883] , despite submerged barrier heights on the po- 
tential  energy  surface  calculated  using  CBS-QB3,  perhaps  due  to 
experimental limitations such as unstable cations or poor Franck- 
Condon  overlap.  Giustini  and  Meloni  conducted  MPIMS  experi- 
ments  on  di- iso -propyl  ether  oxidation  [884]  at  7  Torr and  two 
temperatures, 550 K and 650 K. Two main species were propene 
and acetone. The branching fraction for the latter accounted for the 
majority of initial radical consumption and forms coincident with 
iso -propyl,  via  unimolecular  decomposition  of  the  tertiary  radi- 
2 , or via  ˙ Q OOH-mediated pathways yield- 
cal, (CH

Brumﬁeld  et  al.  [903]  reported  the  ﬁrst  direct  measurements 
of  HO ˙O  from  dimethyl  ether  oxidation  under  atmospheric  pres- 
sure using mid-IR Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) applied to 
a laminar ﬂow reactor. The authors remarked on the uncertainty 
in the reaction of H ˙CO + O 
2 → HO ˙O + CO as one of the main causes 
of discrepancy between the concentration measurements and pre- 
dictions using the Zhao et al. [904] mechanism. Guo et al. [905] re- 
ported the ﬁrst direct measurements of hydrogen peroxide (H 
2 ) 
concentrations under atmospheric pressure in dimethyl ether ox- 
idation  using  molecular  beam  mass  spectrometry  (MBMS)  with 
electron-impact ionization. Several species were measured in addi- 
2  over the temperature range 490 – 750 K, including 
tion to H 
CO,  CO 
2 ,  formaldehyde,  and  acetaldehyde,  and  discrepancies 
were noted with the two mechanisms used for comparison, Zhao 
et al. [904] and Yasunaga et al. [906] . Kurimoto et al. [907] com- 
bined  dual-modulation  FRS  and  MBMS-EI  techniques  to  atmo- 
spheric pressure ﬂow reactor experiments of dimethyl ether oxida- 
tion to extend the temperature range up to 1150 K and also used 
different initial RH concentrations. The aim of the experiments in 
[907] was providing experimental constraints for improving pre- 
2 O-producing chain-propagation re- 
dicted branching ratios for CH 
actions and CO-producing chain-branching reactions. The authors 
developed a simpliﬁed 7-step analytical model to describe the low- 
temperature chemistry and emphasized the importance of improv- 
ing the kinetics of unimolecular  ˙ Q OOH decomposition over second- 
2 -addition as a means of reducing the higher reactivity predicted 
O 
by the two mechanisms employed, Zhao et al. [904] and Liu et al. 
[908] . 

Two-stage  oxidation  chemistry  is  evident  in  species  proﬁle 
measurements  in  dimethyl  ether  [ 848 ,  852 ,  872 ,  874 ,  886 ,  888- 
891 ] and in the temperature oscillation measurements of Stoehr 

59 

et  al.  [891] .  The  latter  measurements  were  ascribed  to  shifts  in 
the reaction mechanism at the cross-over temperature, deﬁned as 
the  temperature  where  ketohydroperoxide-mediated  ˙OH  produc- 
tion ceases and the reaction mechanism moves away from second- 
2 -addition (leading to chain-branching) and towards β-scission of 
O 
2 O + ˙OH). The 
˙ Q OOH (leading to chain-propagation via CH 
oscillatory behavior was captured by 5- and 13-step skeletal mech- 
anisms developed by the authors and replicated predictions from 
the detailed kinetics mechanism of Curran et al. [848] .

Dagaut et al. [887] reported measurements of stable intermedi- 
ates, such as CO, CO 
2 O, and ethene from dimethyl ether ox- 
idation using jet-stirred reactor experiments at 1 and 10 atm and 
from 800 – 1300 K. Speciation measurements were subsequently 
extended to a lower limit of temperature (550 K) in Dagaut et al. 
[886] , where NTC behavior spanned from 600 K to ∼750 K. 

Curran  et  al.  [848] ,  utilizing  the  Princeton  variable  pressure 
ﬂow reactor (VPFR), conﬁrmed via FT-IR measurements that formic 
acid (HOCHO) is a major intermediate in low-temperature dimethyl 
2 O,  the  β- 
ether  oxidation,  with  concentrations  exceeding  CH 
scission  product  of  methoxymethyl  radicals,  in  the  temperature 
range 550 – 650 K. The experiments were conducted from 12 – 18 
2 . Formic acid was 
atm, 550 – 850 K and were diluted in 98.5% N 
not  reported  in  dimethyl  ether  studies  [ 886 ,  887 ]  that  preceded 
Curran et al. [848] , which led to the inclusion of a formic acid sub- 
mechanism in a revised chemical kinetics mechanism. Two path- 
ways were proposed: (1) isomerization of the carbonyl-oxy radi- 
cal formed via O–O scission in hydroperoxy methyl formate, fol- 
lowed by two successive β-scission channels ( Figure 84 ) – the re- 
action also produces CO, which is formed in higher concentration 
than other species; (2)  ˙OH-addition to formaldehyde ( Figure 85 ). 
However, the authors remarked on the uncertainty in the pressure 
dependence of  ˙OH + CH 
2 O, discussed initially in Stief et al. [909] . 
Pathways to HO ˙O were neglected in the primary oxidation scheme 
proposed by Curran et al. [848] . However, the importance of HO ˙O 
is evident from the experiments in Suzaki et al. [ 854 , 869 ]. 

In  subsequent  experiments  using  a  laminar  ﬂow  reactor  at 
atmospheric  pressure  to  probe  product  formation  from  dilute 
dimethyl ether oxidation (340 ppm in 10% O 
2 ), Liu et al. [874] also 
conﬁrmed formic acid as a dominant product formed via the se- 
quence in Figure 84 . Liu et al. [874] did not, however, detect hy- 
droperoxy methyl formate despite characteristic spectral features 
from the FT-IR measurements of Thamm et al. [875] . As a result of 
the absence, it was postulated that hydroperoxy methyl formate, 
the lone γ -ketohydroperoxide isomer of dimethyl ether, is either 
less thermally stable than assumed in literature mechanisms [ 867 , 
885 ,  886 ]  or  is  removed  by  other,  unknown  reactions.  Gao  and 
Nakamura  [910] ,  utilizing  laminar  ﬂow  reactor  experiments  and 
computational modeling, concluded that a critical temperature of 
540  K  exists  that  is  related  to  the  transition  between  ﬁrst-  and 
second-stage ignition and is governed by hydroperoxy methyl for- 
mate decomposition, yet noted that the actual temperature is po- 
tentially lower due to insuﬃcient contact time between the ﬂames 
and thermocouples. 

Methyl formate was detected in Liu et al. [874] , yet only in the 
presence  of  NO  (used  in  initial  concentrations  up  to  600  ppm). 
The lack of methyl formate detection in absence of NO is in con- 
trast to the experiments of Wallington et al. [855] and Jenkin et 
al. [856] . Herrmann et al. [888] conducted dilute (97% Ar) specia- 
tion experiments of dimethyl ether oxidation from 400 – 1200 K 
using an atmospheric-pressure laminar ﬂow reactor coupled to a 
20-eV electron impact time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer, where a 
pulsed electron beam generated via a hot-wire ionizer was used 
as  the  ionization  source.  Formic  acid  and  methyl  formate  were 
detected in the low-temperature region, from around 500 – 750 
K, and the latter was proposed to come from the ketohydroper- 
oxide → carbonyl-oxy  radical  channel.  However,  formic  acid  was

not  quantiﬁed  given  the  similarity  in  m/z  (46.01)  to  the  parent 
molecule, dimethyl ether ( m/z 46.06), the latter of which was high 
in intensity and blurred the adjacent peak in the mass spectrum. 
However, the formic acid peak was separated quite clearly from the 
dimethyl ether signal using careful numerical integration over the 
conjoined peaks.  Subsequently,  Herrmann et  al.  [889] performed 
modeling analysis, which concluded that the measured concentra- 
tions were over-predicted by the Curran et al. [848] and the Zhao 
et al. [904] mechanisms. Modiﬁcations were then applied to both, 
yet the revisions did not capture the temperature dependence of 
methyl formate properly and remained higher by a factor of ∼20. 
Wang et al. [890] conducted an extensive series of experiments 
on  dimethyl  ether  oxidation  at  1  atm  from  400  – 1160  K,  us- 
ing a combination of laminar ﬂow reactor measurements, coupled 
with electron-impact and photoionization-based MBMS, and a jet- 
stirred reactor coupled with photoionization-MBMS. Several inter- 
mediate  species  were  detected  and  quantiﬁed,  including  methyl 
formate. However, formic acid was not experimentally quantiﬁed 
in Wang et al. [890] unlike in Curran et al. [848] and in Liu et al. 
[874] , both of which utilized FT-IR. Wang et al. [890] remarked on 
the detection of m/z 64, the molecular identity of which went un- 
resolved. The two independent experiments both showed onsets in 
photoionization spectra near 10.4 eV at m/z 64. Two species were 
2 OOH) and trihy- 
postulated: hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HOCH 
droxy  methane ((HO) 
3 CH). Because  of an absence of  a reference 
photoionization spectra, Wang et al. [890] calculated adiabatic ion- 
ization energies to identify the species at m/z 64. For HOCH 
2 H, 
adiabatic  ionization  energies  were  in  the  range  9.77  – 9.94  eV, 
( ∼0.5 eV lower than the experimental threshold). For (HO) 
3 CH, the 
energies were ∼11.03 – 11.12 eV (above the experimental threshold 
by ∼0.6 eV).

Potential  energy  surface  calculations  were  also  conducted  in 
Wang et al. [890] on unimolecular decomposition pathways of the 
carbonyl-oxy radical formed via O–O bond-scission of hydroperox- 
ymethyl formate, along with pressure- and temperature-dependent 
rate coeﬃcients calculated using MESMER at 1 atm and 10 atm and 
in the high-pressure limit. The unimolecular decomposition path- 
ways of methoxy formate ( ˙OCH 
2 OCHO) were ﬁrst optimized at the 
B3LYP/6-311 ++ G( d , p ) level of theory, followed by single-point de- 
terminations using quadratic conﬁguration interaction with singles, 
doubles, and perturbative inclusion of triples (UQCISD(T)), as de- 
scribed  in  Harding  et  al.  [911] ,  with  two  basis  sets:  correlation- 
consistent, polarized-valence, triple- ζ (cc-PVTZ), and quadruple- ζ
(cc-PVQZ) basis sets. The UQCISD(T) energies were extrapolated to 
the complete basis set limit (CBS) following the expression in Mar- 
tin [912] . 

Figure 86 a compares the ﬁve unimolecular decomposition rates 
of  the  methoxy  formate  radical  ( ˙OCH 
2 OCHO)  from  Wang  et  al. 
[890] ,  which  is  depicted  in  Figure  87 .  Similar  to  Andersen  and 
Carter [866] , the rate for the pathway leading to formic acid + HC ˙O 
is orders of magnitude larger than the competing pathways. The 
reactions with the next two highest rates lead to CO + HOCH 
2 ˙O, via 
a direct pathway, and to  ˙ H + OCHOCHO, via C–H bond-scission and

formation of a carbon-oxygen double bond. Figure 86 b compares 
the rates from Andersen and Carter [866] for the formic acid chan- 
nel and the isomerization step occurring via a 5-membered transi- 
tion state to rates calculated in [890] , which are likely to be more 
accurate. The calculations in Wang et al. [890] were used to amend 
25 reactions in the mechanism of Zhao et al. [904] , including re- 
vised rate parameters for both RO ˙O formation and direct formalde- 
hyde production via methoxymethyl + O 
2 from Rosado-Reyes et al. 
[858] ,  ˙ R + O

rate  coeﬃcients  calculated  from  the  potential  energy  surface  for 
unimolecular decomposition of methoxy formate radical.

Moshammer  et  al.  [344]  reported  the  ﬁrst  experimental  de- 
tection of hydroperoxymethyl formate from dimethyl ether oxida- 
tion in jet-stirred reactor experiments at 1 atm using synchrotron- 
based photoionization MBMS. Several other species were also de- 
tected, some for the ﬁrst time, and conﬁrmed via ab initio calcula- 
tions of adiabatic ionization energies and reference photoionization 
spectra including formic acid, methylhydroperoxide (H 
3 COOH), 1,3- 
dioxetane – the lone cyclic ether of dimethyl ether – formic an- 
hydride, and carbonic acid which is a product formed via Korcek 
2 ˙CO ˙O), 
reaction. The Criegee intermediate, formaldehyde oxide (H 
was not detected. The detection of 1,3-dioxetane is one of several 
important results in Moshammer et al. [344] because of the impli- 
cations on properly modeling chain-propagation in dimethyl ether 
oxidation. Previous determinations concluded that the cyclic ether 
was not relevant given the barrier height from  ˙ Q OOH being 7 – 8 
kcal/mol over the energy of the  ˙ R + O 
2 entrance channel [ 344 , 870 ]. 
The authors in [344] postulated a mechanistic link connecting the 
observed  performic  acid  (HOOCHO)  to  formic  anhydride  decom- 
2 elimination as proposed in Andersen and 
position via CO and H 
Carter [853] ; the formation of performic acid via recombination of 
˙OH with  ˙OCHO was proposed in Curran et al. [848] .

In a subsequent study, Moshammer et al. [852] quantiﬁed hy- 
droperoxymethyl  formate  and  methylhydroperoxide  for  the  ﬁrst 
time  using  theoretical  calculations  of  absolute  photoionization 
cross-sections  ( Figure  88 ).  Several  other  species  were  quantiﬁed 
in addition, including H 
2 , formic acid, methyl formate, and per- 
formic  acid.  In  cases  where  spectra  were  not  available,  e.g.  hy- 
droperoxymethyl formate, theoretical methods were applied to cal- 
culate  cross-sections.  Moshammer  et  al.  [852]  describe  the  deﬁ- 
ciencies with the approach, yet also include several case studies 
where the simulation method accurately reproduced well-known 
photoionization spectra for acetylene, ethene, methanol, acetalde- 
hyde,  and  several  others,  which  lends  support  to  the  applica- 
tion  of  the  method  to  hydroperoxymethyl  formate.  Comparisons 
of  the  quantiﬁed  mole  fractions  from  the  previous  experiments 
[344]  with  several  mechanisms  [ 578 ,  872 ,  890 ]  revealed  incon- 
sistences in two main areas: (1) the chemistry prescribed in the 
mechanisms, and (2) differences in thermochemistry. The appre- 
ciable inﬂuence of the latter is described for alkanes in Bugler et 
al. [710] . 

Rodriguez  et  al.  [872]  applied  gas  chromatography  and  cw- 
CRDS  to  quantify  products  from  JSR  experiments  on  dimethyl 
ether  near  1  atm  and  from  500  – 1100  K.  Several  species  were 
quantiﬁed, including hydrogen peroxide and methyl formate. The 
concentration  of  the  latter  species  relative  to  formaldehyde  was 
lower  by  a  factor  of  ∼30,  which  is  consistent  with  Kurimoto 
et  al.  [907]  yet  differs  from  Hermann  et  al.  [889]  where  the 
mole  fractions  of  the  two  species  were  of  the  same  order  of

ing  effect  of  excess  O 
latter  effect  was  ascribed  to  inhibition  of  peracetic  acid  forma- 
tion  and  an  increase  in  hydroperoxides,  speciﬁcally  1-ethoxy-1- 
hydroperoxyethane (C 
3 ), which were observed to 
increase  with  oxygen  concentration.  Griﬃths  and  Inomata  [896] , 
similar to the dimethyl ether experiments of Stoehr et al. [891] , 
observed oscillatory temperature in jet-stirred reactor experiments 
over the temperature range 430 – 590 K and governed by a shift in 
the  ˙ R + O 
2 (cid:3) RO ˙O equilibria to the reactant side and remarked on 
the signiﬁcance of acetaldehyde oxidation in the overall reactions 
of diethyl ether, as noted in Waddington [895] . 

Tranter  and  Walker  [815]  conducted  experiments  on  diethyl 
ether oxidation at 753 K and reported no evidence of conjugate 
alkene + HO ˙O using GC-MS diagnostics. Similar results were con- 
cluded for other ethers, namely methyl ethyl ether and ethyl tert - 
butyl ether. Under the conditions of the experiments, suppression 
of the chain-inhibiting channel was ascribed to facile C–O homol- 
ysis, occurring at a rate ∼10 2  higher than for analogous C–C ho- 
molysis in alkyl radicals at 753 K [815] . In addition, thermal de- 
2 -addition was 
composition of initial radicals outcompeting ﬁrst-O 
concluded as the primary cause of low cyclic ether yield in methyl 
tert -butyl  ether  ( ∼1%).  Tranter  and  Walker  found  that  in  both 
methyl-  and  ethyl- tert -butyl  ether  oxidation,  the  yield  of  substi- 
tuted  dioxolanes  via  decomposition  of  ˙ Q OOH  radicals  remained 
less than 5% of the carbon balance, and for the latter, no detection 
of conjugate alkene + HO ˙O was reported. Combined, the results led 
the authors to conclude that C–O β-scission rates exceeded rates 
of reaction with O 
2 . The concentrations of oxygen in [815] ranged 
from 9.0 • 10 17 – 4.6 • 10 18 cm –3 . Evidence for the decomposition 
of initial methyl- tert -butyl ether radicals was an appreciable yield 
3 OH) formed via reaction of the β-scission prod- 
of methanol (CH 
2 , used in the experiments of [815] for  ˙OH 
uct (methoxy) with H 
production, forming methanol + ˙ H . In contrast, in ethyl tert -butyl 
ether, ethanol was not a substantial product (yield < 5%), yet iso - 
butene formed at 90% yield (the co-product with ethoxy from C–O 
β-scission of  ˙ R ). 

Serinyel et al. [897] conducted JSR experiments on diethyl ether 
oxidation at 1 and 10 atm from 450 – 1250 K and remarked on the 
importance of acetic acid in low-temperature kinetics. The primary 
mechanism postulated for acetic acid formation involved reaction 
3 C( = O)O ˙ O (acetylperoxy) with either HO ˙ O or methyl peroxy, 
of CH 
which  yielded  O 
2 O  as  co-products.  Species 
proﬁles for cyclic ether species were not reported.

Tran  et  al.  [898]  conducted  a  series  of  ﬂow  reactor  experi- 
ments on diethyl ether oxidation at 1 atm using gas chromatog- 
raphy  and  MBMS.  The  latter  diagnostic  employed  both  electron- 
impact  and  photoionization  mass  spectrometery.  Several  species 
related either to  ˙ Q OOH or ketohydroperoxide decomposition were 
quantiﬁed,  including  2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane,  acetaldehyde,  acetic

magnitude.  Three  main  pathways  were  deemed  most  signiﬁcant 
to  the  formation  of  methyl  formate:  (1)  recombination  reac- 
tion of methoxy + formyl (CH 
3 ˙O + HC ˙O), (2) decomposition of the 
carbonyl-oxy radical (methoxy formate) formed via O–O scission in 
hydroperoxymethyl formate leading to methyl formate + ˙ H , and (3) 
recombination of methyl and OCHO radicals. Reaction of carbonyl- 
2 yielding methyl formate + HO ˙O was included in a mech- 
oxy + O 
anism  produced  using  EXGAS,  yet  did  not  impact  the  predicted 
methyl formate yields. Species observed in other studies, includ- 
ing formic acid [ 848 , 852 , 858 , 874 , 888 ] and 1,3-dioxetane [344] , 
were not detected. The chemical kinetics mechanism in Rodriguez 
et  al.  [872]  included  sub-mechanisms  for  primary  intermediates, 
e.g. methyl formate and 1,3-dioxetane. 

In  comparison  to  dimethyl  ether,  limited  speciation  exper- 
iments  are  reported  for  low-temperature  oxidation  of  diethyl 
ether.  Waddington  [895]  utilized  a  static  reactor  at  a  ﬁxed 
temperature  of  425  K  to  measure  intermediates  from  diethyl 
ether  oxidation,  including  formaldehyde,  acetic  acid,  acetalde-

results  from  [895]  were  the  role  of  peracetic  acid  in  chain- 
3 CO ˙O + ˙OH, and the inhibit- 
branching, via decomposition into CH

acid, and acetic anhydride. Two distinct NTC regions were iden- 
tiﬁed in both JSR and plug-ﬂow reactor measurements and were 
reﬂected in diethyl ether proﬁles, as well as CH 
2 O and CO proﬁles. 
A slight difference in the temperature of the NTC regions in the 
two ﬂow reactors of ∼50 K was noted. In the JSR experiments, the 
ﬁrst NTC region occurred from ∼525 – 575 K and was ascribed to 
a shift from second-O 
2 -addition towards unimolecular decompo- 
sition of  ˙ Q OOH, where both the –OOH group and unpaired elec- 
tron  are  on  opposing  α carbons,  into  CH 
3 CHO + ˙ O H. 
The  second  region  occurred  in  the  JSR  from  ∼650  – 750  K  and 
was  attributed  to  enhanced  C–O  β-scission  rates  of  α radicals, 
yielding  CH 
2 -addition,  i.e. 
˙ R + O 
2 → RO ˙ O . In effect, the existence of the ﬁrst NTC region in di- 
ethyl ether is due not to a suppression of  ˙ Q OOH chemistry, but to 
diminished second-O 
2 -addition reactions. The second NTC is due 
to  a  reduction  in  the  ﬂux  of  diethyl  ether  radicals  towards  the 
formation of  ˙ Q OOH. The latter change completely restricts chain- 
branching chemistry near ∼750 K at 1 atm.

Subsequent  experiments  by  Tran  et  al.  [899]  examined  the 
effect  of  increased  pressure  on  the  bimodal  NTC  regions  and 
also  compared  the  oxidation  of  diethyl  ether  against  n -pentane 
at  the  same  conditions.  Speciﬁcally,  JSR  experiments  were  con- 
ducted  at  5  atm  and  showed  that  the  ﬁrst  NTC  region  dimin- 
2 - 
ishes  with  increased  pressure  because  of  increased  rates  of  O 
addition  to  both  ˙ R  and  ˙ Q OOH  outcompeting  C–O  β-scission  re- 
actions.  Mole  fractions  of  acetic  anhydride  and  acetic  acid  in- 
creased  at  higher  pressure,  ascribed  to  increased  rates  of  sec- 
2 -addition. Other  ˙ Q OOH-mediated species, such as 2-methyl- 
ond O 
1,3-dioxolane were relatively insensitive to pressure. Temperature- 
dependent mole fraction proﬁles of analogous species in n -pentane 
oxidation  were  compared  to  understand  the  effect  of  the  ether 
group  on  low-temperature  chemistry.  Two  species  ascribed  to 
2 -addition pathways, 1,3-pentadione and acetone, which 
second-O 
are analogous to acetic anhydride and acetic acid in diethyl ether 
oxidation, were signiﬁcantly lower indicating that the ether group 
facilitates both ketohydroperoxide formation and decomposition. 

To account for the signiﬁcant amount of acetic acid quantiﬁed 
in prior experiments, Tran et al. [898] proposed an alternative ke- 
tohydroperoxide decomposition pathway. The reaction involves the 
formation of a cyclic peroxy species ( Figure 89 ), similar in struc- 
ture to that formed via the Korcek mechanism [913] . Importantly, 
acetic acid concentration peaked near 575 K, the upper end of the 
ﬁrst NTC region, which supports the explanation provided for the 
underlying mechanism being dependent on ketohydroperoxide for- 
mation. Two pathways to acetic anhydride (CH 
3 ) 
from  ketohydroperoxide  were  also  proposed  and  peak  formation 
occurred near 500 K – providing additional supporting detail for 
the proposed mechanism. From analysis of photoionization spec- 
tra, 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane was the only cyclic ether reported and, 
in contrast to the ketohydroperoxide-derived species, peak yield of 
the cyclic ether occurred towards the upper end of the second NTC 
region.

Thion et al. [798] reported speciation measurements for di- n - 
butyl  ether  oxidation  from  JSR  experiments  conducted  at  1  and 
10  atm  from  470  – 1250  K.  While  NTC  behavior  occurred  at 
both pressures, the 10 atm experiments revealed two distinct re- 
gions  of  low-temperature  chemistry,  similar  to  diethyl  ether  in 
Tran  et  al.  [898] ,  which  were  separated  by  ∼100  K.  The  ﬁrst 

62 

NTC  region  was  ascribed  to  a  shift  of  the  main  source  of  ˙ O H 
from  decomposition  of  ether-derived  ketohydroperoxides  to  de- 
composition of propylhydroperoxides derived from the propyl rad- 
icals produced in the ketohydroperoxide decomposition. The sec- 
ond NTC region (at higher temperature) was associated with de- 
creasing  effectiveness  of  the  addition  of  fuel  radicals  to  O 
2  and 
a  switch  in  the  driving  chemistry  towards  oxidation  of  n -butyl, 
which forms via C–O bond-scission of α radicals from di- n -butyl 
ether. In addition to the detection of common species, such as ac- 
etaldehyde and formic acid, 2,3-dihydrofuran was detected in the 
10  atm  experiments,  which  is  also  indicative  of  n -butyl  chem- 
istry.  Oxidation  of  tetrahydrofuran,  which  is  formed  via  decom- 
position  of  the  ˙ Q OOH  isomer  1-hydroperoxy-4-butyl,  leads  to 
2,3-dihydrofuran  through  the  chain-inhibiting  step  tetrahydrofu- 
ranyl + O 
2 → 2,3-dihydrofuran + HO ˙ O .  Tran  et  al.  [901]  expanded 
on  the  work  of  Thion  et  al.  [798] ,  conducting  speciation  exper- 
iments  using  a  JSR  (with  GC/MS/FID)  and  a  plug  ﬂow  reactor 
(with MBMS photoionization at 17 eV). Two distinct NTC regions 
were  evident  in  the  species  proﬁles,  consistent  with  [798] ,  and 
Tran et al. [901] emphasized the importance of  ˙ Q OOH dissociation, 
and  the  concomitant  decrease in  second  O 
2  addition,  in causing 
the  lower-temperature  NTC  behavior.  The  experiments  produced 
19  previously  undetected  species,  including  alkylhydroperoxides, 
cyclic ethers, and ketohydroperoxides, although quantiﬁcation was 
not possible due to missing reference electron-impact mass spectra 
and/or photoionization cross-sections. Several of the species were 
not included in the chemical kinetics mechanisms for di- n -butyl 
ether [ 797 , 798 ]. 

Only  a  few  studies  exist  on  thermally  initiated  oxidation  of 
branched  ethers  [ 496 ,  815 ,  914-916 ].  Brocard  et  al.  [914]  em- 
ployed a static reactor to measure product formation from near- 
atmospheric methyl tert -butyl ether oxidation over a 200-K range 
of temperature, 575 – 775 K. The main products detected were iso - 
butene and methanol formed via a 4-centered decomposition re- 
action of methyl tert -butyl ether. Three conclusions were drawn in 
[914] to explain the resistance of methyl tert -butyl ether to chain- 
branching as marked in pressure and temperature measurements: 
(1) favoring of HO ˙O-producing reactions derived from  ˙ Q OOH radi- 
2 -addition or  ˙OH-producing reactions, where the 
cals over second-O 
formation of  ˙ Q OOH is facilitated by weak C–H bond energy on the 
methoxy group and subsequent 7-membered transition state from 
RO ˙O adducts; (2) unimolecular decomposition of α’ radicals lead- 
2 O, the former of which yields exclusively 
ing to tert -butyl and CH 
iso -butene and HO ˙O upon reaction with O 
2 ; (3) isomerization of 
the β radicals into α’ radicals favored over unimolecular decom- 
2 . Norton and Dryer [496] conducted 
position or reaction with O 
experiments on methyl tert -butyl ether, although for temperatures 
greater  than  10 0 0  K,  the  results  of  which  pointed  to  a  favoring 
of unimolecular reactions of  ˙ R forming iso -butene + methanol and 
lesser amounts of CO and other small-molecule species. 

Goldaniga et al. [915] employed a jet-stirred reactor to measure 
product formation from oxidation of several ethers, methyl- and 
ethyl- tert -buytl ether, di- iso -propyl ether, and tert -amyl ether. Nei- 
ther cyclic ethers nor conjugate alkenes were detected. Glaude et 
al. [916] conducted JSR experiments on methyl tert -butyl ether and 
ethyl tert -butyl ether at 10 atm from 750 – 1150 K and equivalence 
ratios  from  0.5  – 2.0.  EXGAS  was  utilized  to  produce  a  detailed 
kinetics  mechanism  and  was  augmented  to  accommodate  ether- 
speciﬁc reactions. Speciﬁcally, activation energies were lowered for 
2 , β-scission of 
three reaction classes – H-abstraction from RH by O 
R ˙O, and β-scission of  ˙ R . For both cases, product formation below 
10 0 0 K was dominated by iso -butene and the corresponding alco- 
hol: methanol for methyl tert -butyl ether and ethanol from ethyl 
tert -butyl ether.

3.4.4. Inﬂuence of ether oxidation pathways on autoignition 
chemistry 

Ethers  such  as  dimethyl  ether  and  diethyl  ether  are  promis- 
ing biofuels in compression-ignition applications because of high 
cetane  numbers  [917-923] .  Ignition  delay  time  trends  of  acyclic 
ethers, including dimethyl ether [ 578 , 893 , 924-927 ], diethyl ether 
[ 906 , 928-930 ], and di- n -butyl ether [ 797 , 902 , 931 ] display pro- 
nounced  NTC  behavior.  The  sections  below  describe  RCM,  shock 
tube, and ﬂow reactor measurements of ignition delay times and 
detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms in the context of alkane ig- 
nition chemistry. 

3.4.4.1. Ignition  delay  time  measurements.  Pfahl  et  al.  [926]  em- 
ployed a high-pressure shock tube to measure stoichiometric ig- 
nition delay times of dimethyl ether and n -decane at 13 atm and 
∼45  atm  from  650  – 1300  K  to  examine  the  NTC  behavior  and 
compare with established measurements of n -heptane [932] . The 
ignition  delay  time  trend  of  dimethyl  ether  at  13  atm  exhibited 
clear NTC behavior and nearly identical temperature dependence 
to both n -alkanes. However, below 10 0 0 K, and despite the smaller 
molecular structure, ignition times of dimethyl ether were approx- 
imately a factor of ∼2 shorter than n -decane in the region where 
peroxy radical chemistry governs ignition. Mittal et al. [924] mea- 
sured dimethyl ether ignition in an RCM from 10 – 20 atm over a 
narrower range of temperature (615 – 735 K), yet studied the ef- 
fect of equivalence ratio (0.4 < φ < 1.5) on ﬁrst- and second-stage 
ignition. In agreement with the Zhao et al. [904] mechanism, the 
experimental measurements in [924] revealed that ﬁrst-stage ig- 
nition delay times were insensitive to both equivalence ratio and 
pressure. In contrast, second-stage ignition is strongly inﬂuenced 
by both equivalence ratio and pressure. Li et al. [925] measured 
ignition delay times of dimethyl ether in air from ∼700 – 1240 K 
near 23 atm, intermediate to the pressures of Pfahl et al. [926] and 
Mittal et al. [924] , and examined the effect of N 
2 dilution from 0 
– 40% and equivalence ratio from 0.5 – 1.5. The level of dilution 
made no impact on the temperature dependence, yet the ignition 
times were shortened with decreasing dilution from 70 – 85%. The 
measurements  also  followed  a  power-law  dependence  similar  to 
that for  alkanes [ 933 , 934 ]. Burke  et  al.  [578] expanded the ex- 
perimental regions for dimethyl ether ignition utilizing shock tube 
and RCM measurements, covering 7 – 41 atm and including φ = 0.3 
equivalence ratio measurements. 

Ignition  delay  time  measurements  for  diethyl  ether  are  more 
limited  than  dimethyl  ether,  yet  the  results  in  Inomata  et  al. 
[929] and Werler et al. [928] conﬁrm NTC behavior and higher re- 
activity than n -pentane. Figure 90 compares ignition delay times 
of dimethyl ether Li et al. [925] to propane [533] ( Figure 90 a) and 
diethyl ether Werler et al. [928] to n -pentane [554] ( Figure 90 b).

The higher reactivity of dimethyl ether compared to propane is due 
in part to the absence of direct, chain-inhibiting pathways leading 
to HO ˙O. Instead, HO ˙O forms mainly via reaction of formyl radicals 
2  to give HO ˙O + CO, where H ˙CO comes almost exclusively 
with O 
via H-abstraction from CH 

2 O. 

Cai  et  al.  [797]  reported  ignition  delay  times  from  a  laminar 
ﬂow reactor for di- n -butyl ether in air at 1 atm using tempera- 
ture proﬁle measurements. The experiments were conducted over 
a narrow temperature range of 485 – 525 K using several equiva- 
lence ratios from φ = 0.5 to φ = 1.0. Within the temperature range, 
no equivalence ratio dependence was observed. 

Ignition delay time measurements for branched acyclic ethers 
at low temperatures are lacking. Fieweger et al. [540] conducted 
shock  tube  experiments  on  methyl  tert -butyl  ether  ignition  at 
nominal pressures of 13 atm and 40 atm from ∼750 – 1200 K. Two 
types of ignition delay times were measured: deﬂagrative (mild) 
ignition,  measured  using  CH  radical  emission  time  proﬁles,  and 
a secondary explosion (overall ignition) measured using pressure 
proﬁles. Both types of ignition times were compared to methanol, 
measured under the same conditions, and the two ignition delay 
time trends were nearly identical at 40 atm. For methyl tert -butyl 
ether, no secondary explosion occurred below 900 K (for methanol, 
the lower limit of temperature was ∼800 K). 

3.4.4.2. Detailed  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms.  Chemical  kinetics 
mechanisms for dimethyl ether oxidation are abundant [ 578 , 848 , 
867 , 872 , 886 , 887 , 890 , 894 , 904 , 906 ]. Dagaut et al. [887] de- 
veloped the ﬁrst chemical kinetics mechanism for dimethyl ether 
oxidation, which contained 43 species and 286 reactions. Subse- 
quently, in Dagaut et al. [886] , a revised mechanism (55 species 
and 331 reactions) was used to simulate the low-temperature in- 
termediate species concentrations and the ﬁrst- and second-stage 
ignition delay times measured in Pfahl et al. [926] . No new species 
proﬁles were reported relative to [887] . The mechanism achieved 
predictions  within  the  experimental  uncertainties.  Curran  et  al. 
[867] expanded on the mechanism development in Dagaut et al. 
[886] ,  leading  to  a  revised  mechanism  with  78  species  and  336 
reactions,  and  conducted  a  modeling  analysis  of  species  proﬁles 
and ignition times. The main alterations to the initial mechanism 
were the rate coeﬃcients for dimethyl ether homolysis and C–O 
β-scission of methoxymethyl radicals. 

Toulson  et  al.  [935]  developed  a  multi-step  analytical  model 
for  dimethyl  ether  autoignition  based  in  part  on  RCM  ignition 
delay time measurements and using rate coeﬃcients assigned to 
generic reactions to deﬁne the reaction mechanism – a technique 
based  on  Halstead  et  al.  [936] .  Burke  et  al.  [578]  reported  that 
2 O  is  not  in  the  high-pressure  limit  at  100 
CH 
atm and that the majority of  ˙ Q OOH from dimethyl ether ( > 80%)

Compared  with  preceding  mechanisms  of  Zhao  et  al.  [904]  and 
Curran et al. [848] , substantial changes were made to rate coeﬃ- 
cients for H-abstraction from dimethyl ether by HO ˙O, CH 
3 O ˙O, and 
˙CH 

3 . 
Glarborg  et  al.  [894]  developed  a  chemical  kinetics  mech- 
anism  by  integrating  a  sub-mechanism  compiled  for  dimethyl 
based  on  literature  rate  coeﬃcients  with  base  chemistry  prior 
mechanisms.  The  rate  coeﬃcients  for  the  sub-mechanism  were 
unaltered  to  reﬂect  the  status  of  knowledge  of  dimethyl  ether 
combustion  chemistry.  As  part  of  the  mechanism  develop- 
ment,  Glarborg  et  al.  [894]  compared  rate  coeﬃcients  for 
2 → RO ˙O,  RO ˙O → ˙ Q OOH,  and 
three  reactions  (methoxymethyl + O 
RO ˙O → products + ˙OH) from the chemical kinetics mechanisms of 
Burke et al. [578] and Rodriguez et al. [872] to measurements from 
Sehested et al. [859] and Eskola et al. [863] . While the results from 
the two experimental studies were consistent, differences between 
rates in the mechanisms were 10 1 or higher, leading the authors to 
remark on the need for experimental measurements and theoret- 
2 O ˙ O potential energy 
ical calculations of reactions on the CH 
surface to reconcile ignition delay measurements in the NTC re- 
gion. Simulations were conducted on ignition delay times, includ- 
ing the experiments of Li et al. [925] . Above 1100 K, the predictions 
were consistent with the experiments. 

3 OCH 

However, within the NTC region, differences up to a factor of 
5 were noted. In addition to the ignition delay times, species pro- 
ﬁles from a high-pressure ﬂow reactor in Glarborg et al. [894] were 
simulated  using  the  newly  developed  chemical  kinetics  mecha- 
nism. Despite accurate predictions of dimethyl ether consumption, 
CO,  and  other  intermediates,  other  species  proﬁles  of  CO 
2  and 
2 O were in error. For the latter species, in addition to CO oxi- 
CH 
2 were postulated, both of which 
dation, two other pathways to CO 
are mediated by formic acid. For CH 
2 O, the two major formation 
channels  from  dimethyl  ether  are:  (1)  unimolecular  decomposi- 
tion from methoxy methyl radicals outcompeting O 
2 -addition; (2) 
˙ Q OOH  decomposition.  Given  the  accuracy  of  species  proﬁle  pre- 
2 O discrepancy may arise from 
dictions for dimethyl ether, the CH 
uncertainty in the rate coeﬃcients and/or reaction mechanisms of 
˙ Q OOH (hydroperoxymethyl-peroxy). 

Numerous chemical kinetics mechanisms also exist for diethyl 
ether oxidation [ 880 , 897-899 , 906 , 937-940 ]. Sakai et al. [880] cal- 
culated  rate  coeﬃcients  for  second-O 
2 -addition  reactions  using 
quantum chemical methods along with rate coeﬃcients speciﬁc to 
reactions of diethyl ether radicals with O 
2  [879] and Burke et al. 
[578] as a base mechanism. Tang et al. [939] compiled a reduced 
mechanism based on Yasunaga et al. [906] and included the for- 
mation of only one of the four possible cyclic ethers (2-methyl- 
1,3-dioxolane). Only four consumption reactions for 2-methyl-1,3- 
dioxolane were included in the mechanism, namely reactions with 
either  ˙ O H or HO ˙ O and subsequent ring-opening. 

Hu et al. [940] conducted a series of ab initio and RRKM master 
equation calculations for H-abstraction and unimolecular decom- 
position reactions of diethyl ether. The rate calculations were com- 
bined  with  sub-mechanisms  from  other  mechanisms  [ 880 ,  906 ] 
and  to  develop  a  revised  diethyl  ether  mechanism.  Comparison 
of  rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction  by  HO ˙ O  and  ˙ O H  to  other 
chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  revealed  differences  of  up  to  10 1 . 
The rate coeﬃcients for the latter reactions from Yasunaga [906] , 
which  were  derived  from  the  ˙ O H + ether  calculations  of  Zhou 
et  al.  [823]  for  abstraction  from  α carbon  and,  from  β carbon, 
by  analogy  to  secondary  C–H  in  the  methylcyclohexane  model 
of  Orme  et  al.  [941]  were  lower  by  more  than  10 2 .  Eble  et  al. 
[938]  constructed  a  detailed  mechanism  and  simulated  the  ig- 
nition  delay  time  experiments  of  Werler  et  al.  [928]  and  Sakai 
et  al.  [880]  with  a  similar  of  success.  The  focus  of  Eble  et  al.

tial concentration = 10 0 0 ppm, residence time of 20 0 0 ms, pressure of 1 atm, and

[938] on reactions involved in ﬁrst-stage ignition led to the iden- 
tiﬁcation of an additional chain-branching mechanism driven ini- 
tially by ethyl formed via decomposition of α radicals of diethyl 
ether. Subsequently, ethyl + O 
2  leads to ethyl peroxy, which upon 
reaction with diethyl ether forms ethylhydroperoxide (C 
5 OOH), 
the decomposition of which yields two radicals: ethoxy + ˙ O H. Such 
a  reaction  sequence  is  favorable  given  the  lower  C–O  bond  en- 
ergy in ether radicals compared with analogous alkyl radicals, e.g. 
3-pentyl. 

2 H 

Serinyel et al. [897] developed a mechanism for diethyl ether 
based on Thion et al. [798] . Rate coeﬃcients for O 
2 -addition re- 
actions  to  ˙ R  and  to  ˙ Q OOH  were  adopted  from  calculations  in 
Goldsmith et al. [534] on propyl radical and rate rules from Vil- 
lano  et  al.  [ 408 ,  409 ]  were  utilized  for  RO ˙ O  isomerization  and 
˙ Q OOH → cyclic  ether + ˙ O H.  Rate  coeﬃcients  for  other  reactions, 
such as H-abstraction, C–C and C–O β-scission of initial radicals, 
and  related  thermochemistry  of  species  were  also  adopted  from 
the literature. 

The  chemical  kinetics  mechanism  of  Tran  et  al.  [898]  for  di- 
ethyl ether incorporated a detailed sub-mechanism deﬁned by 31 
reaction classes, which included the acetic acid channel in Figure 
89 .  In  addition,  and  despite  only  one  species  reported,  all  four 
cyclic ether formation channels were included with rates adopted 
from Sakai et al. [879] . 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane mole fractions were 
quantiﬁed  based  on  adiabatic  ionization  energy  calculations  and 
photoionization cross-section estimation [942] . Compared to Tang 
et al. [939] , consumption channels for cyclic ethers were expanded 
in the Tran et al. [898] mechanism and included reactions with  ˙ O H, 
HO ˙ O , and other radicals. However, only simpliﬁed ring-opening re- 
actions with no radical-speciﬁc mechanisms comprised cyclic ether 
consumption. 

Danilack  et  al.  [943]  report  UCCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-f12  ener- 
gies  of  structures  optimized  by  B2PLYPD3/cc-pVTZ  methods  for 
stationary points along the diethyl ether oxidation pathway from 
initial addition of ethoxyethyl radicals to O 
2  through to the dis- 
sociation  of  the  ketohydroperoxide.  Linked  master  equation  cal- 
culations were then carried out along the full reaction sequence 
to characterize non-Boltzmann effects from reaction of energetic 
products from exothermic reactions, and the effects were incorpo- 
rated into a detailed mechanism for diethyl ether oxidation. No- 
tably,  the  inclusion  of  non-Boltzmann  reactions  could  halve  the 
ignition delay in the negative temperature coeﬃcient region at 1 
atm, pointing to substantial impact of non-Boltzmann chemistry in 
diethyl ether ignition.

900 K at 1 atm. Tran et al. [898] noted the unusual presence of 
two  distinct  NTC  regions  in  diethyl  ether.  Similar  behavior  was 
reported in di- n -butyl ether in Thion et al. [798] . However, from 
chemical kinetics modeling analysis, Tran et al. [898] differentiated 
the chemistry for diethyl ether from that for di- n -butyl ether oxi- 
dation in Thion et al. [798] , in which the lower temperature NTC 
region was explained via subsequent reaction of ketohydroperox- 
ide  decomposition  products,  including  n -propylhydroperoxide ( n - 
C 

7 OOH). 
Cai  et  al.  [797]  and  Thion  et  al.  [798]  independently  devel- 
oped chemical kinetics mechanisms for di- n -butyl ether oxidation. 
The  former  contains  2335  reactions  and  426  species;  the  latter, 
2732 reactions and 436 species. Ignition delay times were simu- 
lated in Cai et al. [797] and compared to alcohols (1-butanol and 
1-pentanol) and to n -octane. The di- n -butyl ether ignition trends 
showed clear NTC behavior, more pronounced than 1-butanol or 
1-pentanol,  and  were  shorter  than  those  for  n -octane  [797] .  Al 
Rashidi et al. [944] calculated high-pressure limit rate coeﬃcients 
from 300 – 2500 K for reactions of di- n -butyl ether radicals using 
the CBS-QB3 and G4 composite methods. Several reaction classes 
were considered, two of which are relevant for low-temperature 
conditions:  isomerization  reactions  of  ˙ R  (i.e.  intramolecular  H- 
migration) via 5-, 6-, and 7-membered transition states, and C–C 
and C–O β-scission of  ˙ R . The authors placed emphasis on deter- 
mining the applicability of estimating rate coeﬃcients for ether re- 
actions using analogous reactions in alkanes and alcohols and, in 
certain cases, analogies were deemed inappropriate including scis- 
sion of C–C bonds adjacent to the –O– group. RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH rates 
of α radicals were 10 2 – 10 3 lower than those for secondary n -octyl 
radicals due to higher barrier heights. 

Only  a  limited  number  of  detailed  mechanisms  exist  for 
branched  acyclic  ethers.  Goldaniga  et  al.  [915]  developed  sub- 
mechanisms for several branched ethers using rate rules and in- 
corporated these into a primary reference fuel mechanism. Using 
EXGAS,  Glaude  et  al.  [916]  reported  a  chemical  kinetics  mecha- 
nism  for  methyl-  and  ethyl- tert  butyl  ether  and  simulated  spe- 
ciation measurements from several ﬂow reactor experiments, in- 
cluding the time-dependent proﬁles from Norton and Dryer [496] . 
Yasunaga  et  al.  [945]  reported  a  combined  mechanism  for  sev- 
eral  branched  species,  including  ethyl  methyl  ether,  methyl  tert - 
butyl  ether,  and  ethyl  tert -butyl  ether.  However,  reactions  rele- 
vant to low-temperature chemistry, namely  ˙ Q OOH formation, cyclic 
ether  formation,  and  second-O 
2 -addition  were  neglected.  Chain- 
inhibition reaction leading to HO ˙O were included. The mechanism 
was utilized to simulate speciation measurements obtained via gas 
chromatography analysis of gases extracted from a shock tube. 

3.4.5. Summary of ether functional group effects 

Despite relatively simple molecular structure, acyclic ethers un- 
dergo  complex  oxidation  mechanisms  due  in  part  to  facile  C–O 
bond-scission  reactions  in  ˙ R  and  ˙ Q OOH  radicals,  which  compete 
with O 
2 -addition, and to reduced bond dissociation energies for C–
H adjacent to the ether group that affect initiation and isomeriza- 
tion reactions. Figure 92 summarizes the low-temperature chain- 
branching  scheme  augmented  to  emphasize  pathways  attributed 
to the ether functional group. The ether group reduces C–H bond 
energy on α carbon by ∼3 – 4 kcal/mol compared to analogous 
(secondary) carbon in alkanes. For all ethers, linear and branched, 
H-abstraction by  ˙OH is site-selective, and reactions with HO ˙O oc- 
cur predominantly from α carbon. In the case of dimethyl ether, 
only α radicals are possible. Branching fraction calculations for  ˙OH- 
initiated H-abstraction from diethyl ether indicate that both α and 
β radicals are relevant, while for branched ethers the formation 
of α radicals is favored because of tertiary carbon adjacent to the 
ether group.

Reactions of O 

Compared  with 

for 
˙OH + dimethyl  ether  are  similar  below  10 0 0  K  (larger  by  ∼65% 
at 500 K). Depending on the level of theory employed, transition 
states  for  both  in-plane  (direct)  abstraction  and  out-of-plane 
(pre-reaction  complex-mediated)  abstraction  may  contribute. 
Regardless  of  the  choice  of  including  a  pre-reaction  complex, 
i.e. using a single- or two-transition-state model, rate coeﬃcient 
calculations  are  largely  consistent  across  several  computational 
studies and are in remarkable agreement with experiment – within 
50% over the range of temperatures relevant to low-temperature 
oxidation. Measurements of rate coeﬃcients for  ˙OH + diethyl ether 
are reported only at temperatures below 450 K, with the excep- 
tion of a single measurement at 753 K and, in the 500 – 1000 K 
range, are larger by a factor of ∼2 compared with  ˙ O H + n -pentane. 
Calculations  of  the  total  rate  coeﬃcient  for  ˙OH + diethyl  ether 
using group rate expressions, derived in part using transition state 
theory, are consistent with measurements.

peroxy radical adduct. The formation of stabilized methoxymethyl-

peroxy ( ˙OOCH

facile  C–O  bond  scission,  along  with  the  reverse  reaction  back

dimethyl ether oxidation are favored over unimolecular decompo- 
2 O + ˙OH 
sition to 1,3-dioxetane + ˙OH. However,  ˙ Q OOH → CH 
is  important  and  pressure-dependent  calculations  indicate  that, 
above 500 K, the reaction is not in the high-pressure limit at 40 
atm. Isomerization of  ˙OOQOOH in dimethyl ether yields the keto- 
hydroperoxide species hydroperoxymethyl formate, which may de- 
compose via the Korcek mechanism or several other pathways (cf. 
Figure  77 ),  producing  formic  acid,  formic  anhydride,  CO,  or  per- 
formic acid. No experimental evidence of carbonyl oxide Criegee 
intermediate, formed coincident with formic acid via hydroperox- 
ymethyl formate, is reported.

While  ˙ Q OOH → cyclic  ether + ˙OH  is  unimportant  in  dimethyl 
ether  oxidation,  because  larger  alkyl  substituents  enable  facile 
RO ˙O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization, reactions that lead to cyclic ether for- 
mation are possible. Quantum chemical calculations indicate two 
distinguishing characteristics attributable to the ether group. Rates 
for RO ˙O → ˙ Q OOH via 6-membered transition state in diethyl ether, 
when  the  –O ˙ O  and  unpaired  electron  occupy  opposing  α sites, 
are higher by a factor of ∼10 than for the analogous alkane re- 
action. Similarly, for β- ˙ Q OOH in diethyl ether, decomposition into 
2-ethoxyoxirane + ˙OH is a factor of 10 higher below 10 0 0 K than 
for the analogous process in n-pentane oxidation that produces n - 
propyl oxirane + ˙OH. In both cases, the ether functional group facil- 
itates the reaction.  ˙OOQOOH → HOO ˙ P OOH isomerization rates are 
more complex and depend on the relative location of the –O ˙ O and 
–OOH groups. Barrier heights for reactions leading to the radical 
precursor  for  ketohydroperoxide  are  lower  compared  to  alkanes, 
whereas  barrier  heights  are  higher  for  other  isomerization  reac- 
tions. 

Ignition delay times for linear ethers are shorter compared to 
alkanes  and  exhibit  clear  NTC  behavior.  For  species  larger  than 
dimethyl ether, namely diethyl ether and di- n -butyl ether, two dis- 
tinct  NTC  regions  that  are  separated  by  ∼125  K  are  evident  in 
species proﬁle measurements. Multiple ignition stages are also ev- 
ident  in  RCM  experiments  of  di- n -butyl  ether.  The  ﬁrst  NTC  re- 
gion  is  due  to  diminished  second-O 
2 -addition  reactions,  rather 
than  suppressed  ˙ Q OOH  formation,  and  the  increase  in  reactivity 
above  the  ﬁrst  NTC  region  in  di- n -butyl  ether  is  in  part  driven 
by secondary oxidation of the propyl radical products of ketohy- 
droperoxide dissociation. The second NTC region is due to facile

a shift in ﬂux away from chain-branching pathways responsible for ignition. Because the –O– group cannot transfer a hydrogen to the radical site in the RO ˙ O or  ˙ O OQOOH 
radicals, chain-inhibiting HO ˙ O elimination is less important for ethers. Dissociation at the –O– site to form carbonyls can lead to chain-propagation. Each type of initial 
radical is depicted in a separate plane, with different colors used as a guide. The alkane oxidation mechanism is depicted in the back plane for reference. Pathways that are 
enhanced by the effects of the functional group are emphasized with bold arrows and labels, and those that are diminished are made lighter or omitted.

3.5. Cyclic ethers 

Understanding  low-temperature  oxidation  kinetics  of  cyclic 
ethers  is  relevant  to  two  areas  of  combustion  chemistry. 
First,  owing  to  advances  in  catalysis  and  synthetic  chem- 
istry,  cyclic  ethers  including  tetrahydrofuran  [ 209 ,  244 ,  262 , 
267 ,  280 ],  2-methyltetrahydrofuran  [ 115 ,  209 ,  244 ,  261 ,  262 , 
[ 209 ,  261 ,  282 ], 
267 ,  280-285 ],  3-methyltetrahydrofuran 
2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran  [ 209 ,  262 ,  277 ,  278 ,  281 ],  2- 
butyltetrahydrofuran  [ 213 ,  292 ],  and  tetrahydropyran  [286]  may 
substantively  contribute  to  sustainable  energy  objectives.  Sec- 
ond,  cyclic  ethers  are  also  primary  intermediates  [ 430 ,  946 , 
947 ]  in  low-temperature  alkane  oxidation  formed  coincident 
with  ˙ O H  via  unimolecular  ˙ Q OOH  decomposition  in  a  chain- 
propagating  step  [ 87 ,  595 ,  948 ,  949 ].  Figure  93  shows  the 
molecular  structure  of  four  representative  cyclic  ethers:  tetrahy- 
drofuran,  2-methyltetrahydrofuran,  3-methyltetrahydrofuran,  and 
tetrahydropyran. The presence of the ether group creates distinct 
H-abstraction sites, e.g. α, β, and γ . The prime notation in Figure 
93 indicates carbon on the side of the ring where the substituent 
is  located.  Because  of  the  electronegativity  of  the  –O– group, 
C–H bond dissociation energy on secondary α carbon is lowered 
by  approximately  4  – 5  kcal/mol  relative  to  secondary  carbon 

in  alkanes  [950-953] .  For  tertiary  α’  carbon,  as  in  Figure  93 b, 
the effect is smaller: ∼2 kcal/mol [952-954] . However, unlike in 
ketones or ethers where the carbonyl group introduces resonance 
stabilization into  initial α radicals,  the  well-depth of  the  adduct 
from  ˙ R + O 
2  reactions  in  ethers  is  similar  to  that  of  alkylperoxy 
radicals  ( ∼36  kcal/mol)  [951] .  One  important  effect  of  the  –O–
group is a reduction in the C–H bond energy of α carbon, which 
results in a favoring of α radicals formed during the initiation step 
via abstraction by  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O , among other radicals. As a result, 
subsequent reactions of α radicals play a central role in oxidation 
reactions of cyclic ethers. 

The  sections  below  are  separated  into  four  main  parts, 
divided  according  to  ring  size  and  number  of  substituents: 
tetrahydrofuran  ( Section  3.5.1 ),  mono-substituted  tetrahydrofuran 
( Section 3.5.2 ), di-substituted tetrahydrofurans, and tetrahydropy- 
ran ( Section 3.5.3 ). Only one di-substituted tetrahydrofuran species 
is  discussed,  2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran  ( Section  3.5.4 ),  as  no 
studies exist on 2,3-dimethyltetrahydrofuran or other isomers. As a 
subset of cyclic ethers, furans ( Section 3.5.5 ) are also reviewed to 
the extent that low-temperature oxidation chemistry is concerned. 
For each section, initiation reactions by  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O are discussed,

ished  despite  second-O 
2 -addition  occurring.  To  quantify  the  sig- 
niﬁcance  of  the  ˙ O OQOOH → alkene + HO ˙ O  reaction,  rate  coeﬃ- 
cients  were  calculated  in  [961]  with  the  MESS  code  [962] ,  us- 
ing  CBS-QB3  energies,  geometries  and  frequencies  and  B3LYP/6- 
311G(2 d , d , p ) to map 1-D hindered rotor potentials. Tunneling ef- 
fects  were  accounted  for  using  Eckart  corrections.  The  results 
showed  that  2-hydroperoxy-2,3-dihydrofuran  is  favored  by  ∼4:1 
over γ -butyrolactone-5-hydroperoxide at 400 K and by ∼10:1 at 
700 K. 

Hansen  et  al.  [342]  utilized  a  JSR  and  molecular  beam  pho- 
toionization mass spectrometry (MBMS) to conduct tetrahydrofu- 
ran oxidation experiments, at 1 atm, and reported the ﬁrst isomer- 
resolved  detection  of  ketohydroperoxides.  On  the  basis  of  pho- 
toionization  spectra  measurements,  as  well  as  ab  initio  calcula- 
tions  of  ionization  energies  and  appearance  energies  of  cations 
formed from the loss of neutral OOH groups, four isomers were 
identiﬁed  ( Figure  98 ).  Of  the  six  isomers  possible  – three  from 
each  of  the  two  initial  α and  β radicals  – two  were  ruled  out 
based on an absence of discernable spectral features in the mea- 
sured ion signal. For the four isomers that were detected, quan- 
tum chemical calculations of photoionization cross-sections, using 
the methodology of Moshammer et al. [852] , provided for quan- 
tiﬁcation  of  ketohydroperoxide  mole  fractions,  which  reached  a 
maximum  at  ∼575  K.  Using  the  ﬁrst-generation  chemical  kinet- 
ics mechanism of Fenard et al. [959] , mole fraction predictions for 
major species (isomers (a) and (b) in Figure 98 a, derived from α- 
tetrahydrofuranyl) were remarkably consistent with the measure- 
ments.  However,  mole  fractions  of  ketohydroperoxides  produced 
from β-tetrahydrofuranyl (isomers (c) and (d) in Figure 98 ), which 
were ∼10 2 lower than species from α-tetrahydrofuranyl, were un- 
derpredicted by at least 10 4 . Because, as a class of molecules, di- 
rect  experiments  are  diﬃcult  to  conduct  on  ketohydroperoxides, 
the  disparities  may  arise  from  incomplete  understanding  of  de- 
composition mechanisms and associated rate parameters, inaccu- 
rate thermochemistry of the species involved, experimental issues 
with quantifying species that are formed in low concentrations, or 
in the case of photoionization detection, the theoretical methods 
by which cross-sections are calculated.

Speciation measurements of tetrahydrofuran oxidation are re- 
ported from thermally initiated ﬂow reactors [ 342 , 959 , 963-966 ] 
and from an RCM [965] . Molera et al. [963] conducted experiments 
using  a  static  reactor  operated  at  473  K  and  156  Torr.  The  ma- 
jority of products were identiﬁed using gas chromatography, with 
the exception of H 
2 and organic hydroperoxides (ROOH), which 
were  quantiﬁed  using  thin-layer  chromatography.  Primary  prod- 
ucts, formed in the initial stages of oxidation, were identiﬁed by 
molar ratios relative to the percent consumption of tetrahydrofu- 
ran and included CH 
3 CHO, CO, and hydroperoxides. Succinic 
acid  was  reported  as  a  primary  product  and  proposed  to  arise 
from  ring-opening  of  HOO ˙ P OOH  species,  where  the  peroxy  and 
hydroperoxy groups are bonded to opposing α carbon [963] . An 
alternative water-catalyzed mechanism was also postulated: suc- 
cinic  anhydride + H 
2 O → succinic  acid.  However,  noting  that  suc- 
cinic acid is an oxidation product of butanedial, formed via  ˙ Q OOH 
ring-opening, secondary reactions involving the aldehyde may also 
contribute.

Dagaut [964] employed JSR experiments under dilute conditions

(N 
furan oxidation at 10 atm from 800 – 1100 K at a residence time of 
500 ms. 2,3-dihydrofuran and 2,5-dihydrofuran, both formed coin- 
cident with HO ˙ O via  ˙ R + O 
2 , were detected only in trace amounts. 
Neither  species  were  detected  in  Molera  et  al.  [963]  either,  al- 
though  furan  was  quantiﬁed  ( ∼2%  of  product  formation).  Van- 
hove  et  al.  [965]  conducted  speciation  measurements  utilizing

both a JSR, with dilution of N

∼1.5 atm. The experiments were complemented using a coupled 
cluster quantum chemical method, CCSD(T)/cc-pV(D,T)Z//MP2/aug- 
cc-pVDZ,  which  identiﬁed  both  direct  and  indirect  abstraction 
pathways – the latter involving formation of a pre-reaction com- 
plex formed via hydrogen bonding to the –O– group. The ab initio 
results indicated that both pathways were relevant at combustion 
conditions ( Figure 94 ). At the lower end of temperature (800 K), 
branching towards α radicals was favored ( α: β ∼2:1) owing to re- 
duced C–H bond energies [950-953] while towards the higher end 
(1200 K), α: β ∼1:1. Rate coeﬃcient measurements in other stud- 
ies of  ˙ O H + tetrahydrofuran → H 
2 O + ˙ R cover a lower temperature 
range of 263 – 400 K [ 822 , 826 , 956-958 ]. 

Figure 95 compares high-pressure limit rate coeﬃcients for H- 
abstraction  from  tetrahydrofuran  via  ˙ O H,  from  Giri  et  al.  [955] , 
and  via  HO ˙ O  [959]  with  analogous  reactions  for  cyclopentane 
[768] . The Fenard et al. [959] mechanism estimated the rate pa- 
rameters  for  reaction  with  HO ˙ O  based  on  similar  calculations 
for  2-methyltetrahydrofuran  and  2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran  in 
Chakravarty and Fernandes [80] . The Sarathy et al. [768] mecha- 
nism  utilized  the  ˙ O H + cyclopentane  rate  from  Sivaramakrishnan 
and Michael [746] and rate rules [960] for HO ˙ O + cyclopentane. For 
both radicals, as evident in Figure 95 , rate coeﬃcients for abstrac- 
tion are higher for tetrahydrofuran. For example, at 700 K, the dif- 
ference is a factor of ∼3 for  ˙ O H and a factor of ∼5 for HO ˙ O . Un- 
like for alkanes and some oxygenated biofuels, direct calculations 
of HO ˙ O + tetrahydrofuran are not reported, which is notable given 
the signiﬁcance of HOO-elimination reactions [ 959 , 961 ].

of tetrahydrofuran were conducted in Antonov et al. [961] at tem- 
peratures  from  40 0  – 70 0  K  and  pressures  of  10  – 20 0 0  Torr. 
Ring-opening  of  initial α-tetrahydrofuranyl  radicals  became  rele- 
vant near ∼650 K, evident from propene formation via oxidation 
of  n -propyl  ( Figure  96 ).  In  comparison  to  other  reaction  path- 
ways,  however,  ring  opening  of  initial  radicals  remained  a  mi- 
nor channel. The majority of the products identiﬁed were derived 
2 -addition to 
from O 
αα’ - ˙ Q OOH radicals. The main products conﬁrmed via photoioniza- 
tion spectra were butanedial ( +  ˙ O H),  2,3-dihydrofuran ( + HO ˙ O ), 
γ -butyrolactone-5-hydroperoxide ( +  ˙ O H), and 2-hydroperoxy-2,3- 
dihydrofuran  ( +  HO ˙ O ).  The  latter  two  are  formed  via  unimolec- 
ular  decomposition  of  ˙ O OQOOH  ( Figure  97 )  and  inhibit  chain- 
branching.

The identiﬁcation of 2-hydroperoxy-2,3-dihydrofuran in Figure

Dagaut [964] reported the ﬁrst detailed chemical kinetics mech- 
anism for tetrahydrofuran, which focused on high-temperature oxi- 
dation pathways and, consequently, excluded peroxy radical chem- 
istry. In a similar vein, Tran et al. [967] developed a detailed mech- 
anism for predicting species proﬁles in tetrahydrofuran ﬂames. Fe- 
nard et al. [959] developed the ﬁrst mechanism for tetrahydrofu- 
ran to include low-temperature chemistry of peroxy radicals. Ring- 
opening reactions  of  ˙ Q OOH  ( Figures 97  and 99 ) were  accounted 
for and rate parameters for both the  ˙ O OQOOH-related kinetics re- 
ported  in  Antonov  et  al.  [961]  and  for  the  ring-expansion  reac- 
tions  of  ˙ Q OOH  in  Figure  100  were  included.  The  latter  reaction 
mechanism was postulated initially in Vanhove et al. [965] . High- 
pressure-limit  rate  coeﬃcients  were  calculated  in  Fenard  et  al. 
[959] at the CBS-QB3 level of theory for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomeriza- 
tion, concerted  ˙ R + O 
2 → alkene + HO ˙ O reactions, and unimolecular 
˙ Q OOH  decomposition  reactions  forming  alkene + HO ˙ O  and  cyclic 
ether + ˙ O H. The results were compared with alkane rate rules from 
Cai et al. [968] and differed appreciably, in several cases by ∼10 1 
– 10 2 . In particular, rates for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization via both 
5-membered and 6-membered transition states and  ˙ Q OOH → 3,4- 
epoxytetrahydrofuran + ˙ O H deviated from rate rules.

both sets of measurements qualitatively detected the same species, 
with several notable exceptions including allyl formate (CHO–O–
CH 
2 ) and butanedial – both of which were detected only 
in the RCM measurements and ascribed to ring-opening of either 
˙ Q OOH or bicyclic ethers. As noted in Antonov et al. [961] , butane- 
dial is a major product of unimolecular  ˙ Q OOH decomposition ow- 
ing to favorable energetics on the respective  ˙ R + O

ergy surface and to exclusive involvement of labile α radicals. 

Belhadj et al. [966] conducted JSR experiments on tetrahydro- 
furan from 550 – 620 K at a residence time of 20 0 0 ms, using a

reactor were condensed in acetonitrile for subsequent analysis via

oxides,  formed  via  third-O

[965] . 

Fenard et al. [959] noted that the predictions by the mecha- 
nism were sensitive to  ˙ Q OOH branching fractions, i.e. the ratio of 
unimolecular decomposition rates to second-O 
2 -addition rates. The 
conclusion  was  drawn  from  the  observation  that  adjustments  in 
rate parameters related to  ˙ Q OOH led to improved predictions of 
species proﬁles, but to the detriment of ignition delay time predic- 
tions. The uncertainty in  ˙ Q OOH chemistry suggests an incomplete 
description of the underlying kinetics in one or both of the reac- 
tion channels. Notably, two of the major  ˙ Q OOH ring-opening prod- 
ucts – butanedial ( Figure 97 ) and allyl formate ( Figure 99 ) – were 
not  quantiﬁed,  which  may  add  to  the  level  of  uncertainty.  Sev- 
eral other species detected from the JSR experiments in Vanhove 
et  al.  [965] ,  such  as  propanal  and  oxirane,  exhibited  signiﬁcant 
formation near 600 K indicating a connection to low-temperature 
chemistry,  yet  were  not  reproduced  by  the  chemical  kinetics 
mechanism. 

2 .  Wu  et  al.  [969]  included  O 

Wu  et  al.  [969]  expanded  on  the  mechanism  of  Fenard  et 
al.  [959]  by  combining  sub-mechanisms  for  furan  from  Tran  et 
al.  [970]  and  2,3-dihydrofuran  from  Fan  et  al.  [971] .  In  addi- 
tion,  thermochemistry  and  rate  parameters  were  added  to  de- 
scribe  reactions  of  2,3-dihydrofuranyl  radicals  with  O 
2  to  recon- 
cile ignition delay time predictions. In Fenard et al. [959] , both α
and β isomers of 2,3-dihydrofuranyl exclusively yield furan + HO ˙ O 
2 -addition  to 
upon  reaction  with  O 
2,3-dihydrofuranyl,  isomerization  of  RO ˙ O  adducts  to  ˙ Q OOH,  uni- 
molecular decomposition of  ˙ Q OOH into cyclic ether + ˙ O H, and dis- 
proportionation the cyclic ether (2,6-dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-ene) 
with  ˙ O H  to  produce  formyl + prop-1-en-1-yl-3-al  ( ˙CHCHCH = O). 
The  contrast  in  ignition  delay  time  predictions  between  Fenard 
et  al.  [959]  and  Wu  et  al.  [969]  highlights  the  effect  of  sub- 
mechanisms for primary intermediates [428-430] , which are com- 
monly excluded from detailed chemical kinetics mechanism devel- 
opment. Ignition delay time predictions using the latter, expanded 
mechanism [969] were shorter and became consistent with RCM 
measurements below 700 K. 

Measurements  of  tetrahydrofuran  ignition  delay  times  in- 
clude  the  high-pressure  shock  tube  experiments  of  Uygun  et  al. 
[972] (691 – 1100 K; 20 and 40 atm), RCM experiments of Vanhove 
et al. [965] (640 – 900 K; 5 and 10 atm), and RCM experiments of 
Wu et al. [969] (680 – 905 K; 18 atm). The 20-atm results from 
[972] are plotted in Figure 101 a against cyclopentane ignition de- 
lay times from Sarathy et al. [553] . While NTC behavior is evident 
in cyclopentane from ∼750 – 825 K, the lower limit of temperature 
in Uygun et al. [972] prevents a similar assessment for tetrahydro- 
furan. Within the range of overlapping temperature, ignition de- 
lay times are appreciably shorter for tetrahydrofuran than for cy- 
clopentane:  4  ms  compared  to  225  ms  at  780  K  (10 0 0/T = 1.28 
K –1 ). 

Stoichiometric ignition delay time simulations were conducted 
in  the  present  review  using  the  mechanism  of  Fenard  et  al. 
[959]  and  compared  to  a  recent  mechanism  for  cyclopentane 
2 mole fraction 
[553] at an initial pressure of 20 atm and with an N 
of ∼0.76 ( Figure 101 b). In both cases, ignition was deﬁned using 

the method of steepest ascent [361] applied to  ˙ O H time histories, 
which were modeled using isobaric conditions with the 0D homo- 
geneous reactor module in ChemKin. For simplicity, facility effects 
are neglected in the model predictions in Figure 101 b, which con- 
tributes to any quantitative discrepancies with experiment. Simi- 
lar to the experimental trends, NTC behavior, which is indicative 
of  peroxy  radical-mediated  chemistry,  is  more  prominent  in  cy- 
clopentane than in tetrahydrofuran. In addition to the NTC differ- 
ence, predicted ignition delay times for the cyclic ether are ∼10 1 
shorter than for the cycloalkane below ∼800 K. 

The  trends  reﬂected  in  both  the  experimental  and  model- 
predicted ignition delay times in Figure 101 suggest that second- 
2 -addition  and  related  decomposition  steps  are  more  facile  in 
O 
tetrahydrofuran  and,  in  addition,  raises  questions  as  to  the  role 
of products formed via  ˙ R or  ˙ Q OOH ring-opening [ 309 , 522 , 951 , 
961 ].  In  addition  to  mechanistic  explanations,  larger  rate  coeﬃ- 
cients for H-abstraction by  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O (cf. Figure 95 ) may play 
a role in facilitating shorter ignition delay times by contributing 
to  higher  rates  of  initiation  reactions.  NTC  behavior,  evident  in 
cyclopentane ignition, results from combined effects of back dis- 
sociation  of  RO ˙ O  into  ˙ R + O 
2  and  a  shift  in  the  ﬂux  of  remain- 
ing RO ˙ O radicals away from chain-branching and towards chain- 
inhibiting and chain-propagating pathways. Concerning the weak 
NTC region of tetrahydrofuran, potential causes may include: (1) 
favoring  of  products  in  ˙ R + O 
2  (cid:2) RO ˙ O  equilibria,  (2)  facile  ring- 
opening  of  tetrahydrofuranyl  radicals  reducing  chain-propagation 
2 -addition,  and  (3)  higher  rates  of  HOO-elimination. 
from  ﬁrst-O 
For  the  latter  type  of  reaction,  several  mechanisms  are  possible 
– direct elimination ( ˙ R + O 
2 → conjugate alkene + HO ˙ O ), concerted 
elimination (RO ˙ O → conjugate alkene + HO ˙ O ), or sequential elimi- 
nation (RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH → conjugate alkene + HO ˙ O ). 

Using  rate  parameters  from  the  mechanism  for  tetrahydro- 
furan  from  Fenard  et  al.  [959]  and  for  cyclopentane  from  Al 
Rashidi et al. [768] , rates for all three types of HOO-elimination 
in  the  high-pressure  limit  are  compared  in  Figure  102 .  Fe- 
nard  et  al.  [959]  employed  CBS-QB3  for  electronic  structure 
calculations  canonical  transition  state  theory  with  asymmetric 
Eckart  potential  for  tunneling  corrections,  while  Al  Rashidi  et 
al. [768] used UCCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/6-311 ++ G( d , p ) 
and  the  MESS  code  [962]  for  rate  calculations.  The  largest  dif- 
ference  between  the  two  systems  is  in  the  direct  pathway 
( Figure  102 a),  where  the  rate  of  α-tetrahydrofuranyl + O 
2 → 2,3- 
dihydrofuran + HO ˙ O  is  more  than  an  order  of  magnitude  higher 
than  for  cyclopentyl + O 
2 → cyclopentene + HO ˙ O  up  to  10 0 0  K; 
approximately  10 3  at  500  K  and  ∼10 2  at  750  K.  For  other 
HOO-elimination pathways, the differences are smaller or within 
the  uncertainty  of  the  computational  method.  Figure  102 b  com- 
pares  rates  of  concerted  HOO-elimination  from  cyclopentyl  per- 
oxy and from α-tetrahydrofuranyl peroxy, which are similar over 
the  range  relevant  to  low-temperature  combustion.  The  effect 
of  the  ether  group  on  rates  of  sequential  HOO-elimination  de- 
pends  on  the  location  of  the  hydroperoxy  group.  Compared  to 
cyclopent-1-yl-2-hydroperoxy,  the  rate  for  tetrahydrofuran-2-yl- 
3-hydroperoxy  is  similar  up  to  ∼900  K  ( Figure  102 c)  and  is 
lower  for  tetrahydrofuran-3-yl-2-hydroperoxy  ( Figure  102 d).  The 
net  effect  of  higher  HOO-elimination  rates  for  tetrahydrofu- 
ran,  largely  derived  from  the  direct  HOO-elimination  pathway, 
may  lead  to  a  more  rapid  accumulation  of  hydrogen  peroxide

Chakravarty  and  Fernandes  [80]  calculated  site-speciﬁc  high- 
pressure-limit  rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction  reactions 
HO ˙ O + 2-methyltetrahydrofuran → H 
2 + ˙ R  from 500  – 2000 
K.  The  total  rate  coeﬃcient  displayed  signiﬁcant  method  de- 
pendence  from  the  two  different  levels  of  theory  employed: 
the  composite  CBS-QB3  method  and  a  coupled  cluster  method, 
CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/cc-pVTZ.  CBS-QB3  produced  rate  co- 
eﬃcients  that  were  > 10 2  larger  compared  with  the  coupled 
cluster  method,  due  to  the  former  predicting  a  lower  activa- 
tion  energy  (by  ∼4  kcal/mol).  In  order  to  assess  the  inﬂuence 
of  the  ether  group,  rate  coeﬃcients  were  also  calculated  in 
[80]  for  HO ˙ O + methylcyclopentane → H

Rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction  were  higher  in  the  case  of 
2-methyltetrahydofuran  by  ∼4.4  at  750  K  and  ∼1.9  at  10 0 0  K. 
Site-speciﬁc  k (T)  were  also  calculated.  Comparisons  to  methyl- 
cyclopentane  revealed  that  rate  coeﬃcients  were  similar  for

H-abstraction  from  primary  carbon  (i.e.  from  the  –CH 
3  group), 
slightly  lower  in  2-methyltetrahydrofuran  for  abstraction  from  a 
3 group (i.e. β’ ), and higher 
secondary carbon adjacent to the –CH 
by > 10 1 for tertiary abstraction (i.e. α’ ). 

Branching  fractions  calculated  in  Chakravarty  and  Fernandes 
[80]  indicated,  using both levels  of theory,  that  the principal 
hydrogen-abstraction site below 900 K is α and α’ carbon, mainly 
the  latter,  and  abstraction  from  β and  β’  carbon  is  negligible. 
However,  while  both  methods  are  consistent  in  predicting  the 
main  channel,  a  dependence  on  computational  method  was  ev- 
ident  in  the  branching  fractions  of  secondary  α carbon  (oppo- 
3  group).  For  both  computa- 
site  from  the  location  of  the  –CH 
tional methods, cis -/ trans - conformations of HO ˙ O and –CH 
3 groups 
in the transition state inﬂuenced abstraction from (secondary) α
carbon. Using CBS-QB3, H-abstraction from the secondary α car- 
bon  on  the  trans -  isomer  was  nearly  10 1  lower  relative  to  the 
cis -  isomer  over  the  temperature  range  covered.  Using  the  cou- 
pled cluster method, however, the difference was less than a factor 
of 2 below 10 0 0 K. For both methods, abstraction from the –CH

group became relevant ( > 10% of the branching fraction) only above 
∼900 K. 

High-pressure-limit rate coeﬃcients were calculated using tran- 
sition state theory for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization reactions in 2- 
methyltetrahydrofuran at the CBS-QB3 level in Parab et al. [973] . 
The calculations included cis - and trans - isomers for all RO ˙ O radi- 
cals and branching fractions showed RO ˙ O -isomer-speciﬁc rates. For 
example,  in  isomerization  reactions  of α-RO ˙ O ,  the  trans -  isomer 
exclusively formed α’ - ˙ Q OOH over the 50 0 – 20 0 0 K temperature 
range, while the cis - isomer formed several  ˙ Q OOH isomers includ- 
ing β- ˙ Q OOH, β’ - ˙ Q OOH, and γ - ˙ Q OOH.

Three  detailed  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  exist  for  2- 
methyltetrahydrofuran [ 954 , 974 , 975 ], two of which contain per- 
oxy  radical  chemistry  [ 954 ,  974 ].  Utilizing  rate  coeﬃcients  for 
HO ˙ O + 2-methyltetrahydrofuran → H 
2 + ˙ R  from Chakravarty and 
Fernandes  [80] ,  Fenard  et  al.  [974]  developed  a  chemical  kinet- 
ics  mechanism (507  species,  2425  reactions) and  simulated  spe- 
ciation  measurements  from  an  RCM,  in  addition  to  ignition  de- 
lay  times  from  640  – 900  K  and  from  3  – 20  atm.  Reac- 
tion  pathway  analysis  indicated  that  the  tertiary  α’  radical  pre- 
dominately reacts with O 
2 , undergoing chain-inhibiting reactions 
that  form  HO ˙ O  coincident  with  5-methyl-2,3-dihydrofuran  or  2- 
methylenetetrahydrofuran.  The  same  analysis  indicated  that  the 
secondary  α radical  proceeds  via  addition  reactions  with  O 
2  to 
form a stabilized peroxy radical, which subsequently reacts via uni- 
2 -addition. β radical isomers 
molecular decomposition or second O 
were ∼20% of the initial radical population and reacted with O 
2 to 
form peroxy radicals. Similar to Fenard et al. [974] , the mechanism 
of Tripathi et al. [954] , developed using 250 species and 2494 re- 
actions, predicts ∼10% of α radicals undergo ring-opening at 650 
K, with the remainder reacting with O 
2 . At 1100 K, ring-opening 
became  the  primary  reaction  path.  For  tertiary α’  radicals,  ring- 
opening reactions were slightly higher (branching fraction ∼15%) 
and also became the primary reactions at 1100 K. Reactions form- 
ing and consuming β radicals were similar to [974] . 

Ignition delay times measured for 2-methyltetrahydrofuran in 
Fenard et al. [974] and Tripathi et al. [954] using an RCM and a 
shock tube from 10 – 40 atm and 640 – 1400 K displayed only 
slight  NTC  behavior,  from  ∼750  – 950  K.  The  lack  of  two-stage 
ignition indicates that chain-propagation and chain-inhibiting re- 
actions, including ring-opening reactions of initial radicals, are fa- 
vored over second-O 
2 -addition reactions. Wang et al. [978] also re- 
port ignition delay times from 1 – 10 atm. However, the lowest 
temperature (1050 K) extends beyond the range where peroxy rad- 
ical chemistry is relevant. 

The ab initio calculations of Parab et al. [976] for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH 
isomerization and the ignition delay time/chemical kinetics mod- 
eling  work  of  Tripathi  et  al.  [977]  are  the  only  two  studies  on 
low-temperature oxidation of 3-methyltetrahydrofuran. Parab et al. 
[976] conducted an extensive series of calculations using the CBS- 
QB3 composite method, reporting high-pressure limit rate coeﬃ- 
cients and branching fractions for RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH over the tempera- 
ture range 500 – 1250 K. Rate coeﬃcients were computed for both 
cis - and trans -RO ˙ O and several isomer-speciﬁc results were noted. 
For all RO ˙ O species, internal H-abstraction occurs predominantly at 
α or α’ carbon (cf. Figure 93 c) via a 6-membered transition state: 
> 90% over the entire temperature range for six of the eight iso- 
mers. The branching fraction towards α or α’ radicals is the low- 
est for two of the cis -RO ˙ O species because of hydrogen-abstraction 
from the methyl group, also occurring via a 6-membered transi- 
tion state, becoming relevant – approximately 20% of the branch- 
ing fraction for α’ -RO ˙ O and ∼30% for β-RO ˙ O at 600 K. α’ and β re- 
fer to carbon atoms adjacent to the methyl-substituted carbon (cf. 
Figure 93 c). Branching fractions towards α or α’ radicals remain 
above ∼65% over the temperatures covered, however. The results 
for 3-methyltetrahydrofuran were compared with calculations on 

analogous  reactions  in  methylcyclopentane  using  the  same  level 
of theory in order to assess the inﬂuence of the ether group on 
RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization rates. The main conclusion drawn was 
that the ether group increases the rate of isomerization by ∼10 1 
for the majority of the comparisons [976] . 

Figure 103 summarizes RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization rates from 
Parab  et  al.  on  α-RO ˙ O  radicals  of  3-methyltetrahydrofuran 
[976]  and  2-methyltetrahydrofuran  [973]  for  abstraction  from  α
carbon via 6-membered transition states. From comparison of the 
two  sets  of  results  from  Parab  et  al.  [ 973 ,  976 ],  RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH 
isomerization  rates  via  6-membered  transition  states  for  3- 
methyltetrahydrofuran  are  not  isomer-dependent,  whereas  some 
isomer  dependence  is  evident  for  2-methyltetrahydrofuran.  For 
2-methyltetrahydrofuranperoxy,  isomerization  rates  for  the  trans - 
conformer ( Figure 103 b) are substantially higher ( ∼10 5 ) than for 
the cis - isomer at 550 K and remain ∼10 2  higher towards 10 0 0 
K. In contrast, conformational effects are negligible for isomeriza- 
tion rates of α-RO ˙ O radicals formed from 3-methyltetrahydrofuran. 
For  context,  comparisons  were  made  in  Parab  et  al.  [ 973 ,  976 ] 
to  analogous  reactions  for  methylcyclopentane.  Relative  to  cis - 
1-methylcyclopentyl-3-peroxy,  isomerization  rates  for  α-RO ˙ O  of 
3-methyltetrahydrofuran  are  appreciably  higher,  > 10 1  at  750 
K,  while  the  rate  at  the  same  temperature  for  α-RO ˙ O  of  2- 
methyltetrahydrofuran  is  lower  by  a  factor  of  ∼4  ( Figure  103 a). 
The reason for the lower rate in the latter case, despite lower C–H 
bond energies on α carbon, is the trans - position of the tertiary hy- 
drogen atom relative to the –O ˙ O group. The opposite result is ob- 
served for trans -2-methyltetrahydrofuranyl-5-peroxy ( Figure 103 b), 
in  which  case  the  abstracting  peroxy  group  occupies  the  same 
plane  as  the  tertiary  hydrogen.  The  effect  of  the  favorable  ori- 
entation is a signiﬁcant increase in the isomerization rate: ∼10 2 
higher than both trans -1-methylcyclopentyl-3-peroxy and trans -3- 
methyltetrahydrofuranyl-5-peroxy at 750 K. 

Tripathi et al. [977] reported shock-tube and RCM ignition de- 
lay time measurements for 3-methyltetrahydrofuran, conducted at 
high pressure (10 – 40 bar) over 625 – 1250 K, and developed the 
ﬁrst chemical kinetics mechanism. Because of the reduction in C–
H bond energy, H-abstraction by  ˙ O H at low temperature primar- 
ily occurs on α carbon ( ∼75%) followed by abstraction from ter- 
tiary  β’  and  secondary  β carbon  (both  ∼10%).  Abstraction  from 
3 group is of minor importance. To a larger extent than in 
the –CH 
2-methyltetrahydrofuran [973] , the predictions indicate that ring- 
opening reactions of initial α radicals in 3-methyltetrahydrofuran 
are competitive with O 
2 -addition at temperatures below 750 K and 
ultimately become favored with increasing temperature. 

The results in [977] were compared to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran 
from Tripathi et al. [954] , which conﬁrmed that chain-branching 
below  750  K  is  more  pronounced  in  3-methyltetrahydrofuran, 
and  were  consistent  with  the  RCM  measurements  of  Sudholt  et 
al.  [952] .  One  of  the  primary  conclusions  from  the  compari- 
son  in  [977]  was  the  impact  of  the  methyl  group  location  rel- 
ative  to  the  ether  group.  When  the  two  are  adjacent,  as  in  2- 
3 group is in the α’ position, 
methyltetrahydrofuran where the –CH 
chain-branching is restricted because of the lack of available hy- 
drogen atoms for the  ˙ O OQOOH isomerization step required for ke- 
tohydroperoxide formation ( Figure 104 ). 

Figure 105 a shows stoichiometric ignition delay time measure- 
ments for 2-methyltetrahydrofuran from Tripathi et al. [954] and 
for 3-methyltetrahydrofuran from Tripathi et al. [977] at 20 atm. 
Differences  between  the  two  isomers,  outside  of  the  stated  ex- 
perimental  uncertainty  of  ±15%,  occur  below  ∼800  K;  at  650 
K,  2-methyltetrahydrofuran  ignition  times  are  longer  by  a  fac- 
tor  of  ∼3.  As  noted  in  [977]  and  depicted  in  Figure  104 ,  the 
longer  ignition  delay  times  of  2-methyltetrahydrofuran  are  due 
to the lack of available hydrogen on α carbon for abstraction in 
˙ O OQOOH  isomerization  reactions.  In  contrast,  in  the  case  of  2-

methyltetrahydrofuran, four such carbon sites are present as is a 
tertiary  C–H  bond  (i.e.  β’ ).  The  latter  point  is  additionally  no- 
table because  ˙ O OQOOH isomerization involving that site undergoes 
a  favorable  6-membered  transition  state.  Figure  105 a  also  com- 
pares the two cyclic ethers to methylcyclopentane, which exhibits 
NTC  behavior  over  a  similar  range  of  temperature  as  cyclopen- 
tane. As observed with the tetrahydrofuran/cyclopentane compar- 
ison (cf. Figure 101 ), ignition delay times of both methylated cyclic 
ethers are signiﬁcantly shorter than methylcyclopentane. At 780 K, 
the same temperature used in the previous comparison in Figure 
101 , the difference is more than one order of magnitude: methyl- 
cyclopentane (76.1 ms), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (5.9 ms), and 3- 
methyltetrahydrofuran (2.7 ms). 

Stoichiometric ignition delay time simulations were conducted 
in  the  present  review  at  20  atm  using  the  mechanisms  of  Tri- 
pathi et al. [954] for 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and Tripathi et al. 
[977]  for  3-methyltetrahydrofuran  ( Figure  105 b).  Simulations  of 
methylcyclopentane ignition were also conducted using the mech- 
2  mole fractions of ∼0.76 were 
anism of Fridlyand et al. [979] ; N 
used in all cases. Ignition was deﬁned using the method of steep- 
est ascent [361] applied to  ˙ O H time histories modeled using iso- 

baric  conditions  with  the  0D  homogeneous  reactor  module  in 
ChemKin PRO. The predictions are consistent with the main ob- 
servations in the experiments, namely that NTC behavior is more 
prominent in the alkane and that cyclic ether ignition delay times 
are signiﬁcantly shorter. Note that facility effects are neglected in 
Figure 105 b, which contributes to any quantitative discrepancy. The 
comparison in Figure 105 highlights two aspects concerning igni- 
tion  chemistry  of  functionalized  molecules  – the  effect  of  ether 
group and the effect of methyl substituent location on methylated 
tetrahydrofuran. The explanation for the trends between the cyclic 
ethers and methylcyclopentane are likely similar to those for the 
tetrahydrofuran-cyclopentane comparison in that ring-opening re- 
actions and peroxy radical formation play central roles. 

Cai  et  al.  [968]  developed  the  ﬁrst  chemical  kinetics  mecha- 
nism for 2-butyltetrahydrofuran and reported shock-tube and RCM 
ignition  delay  time  measurements  at  20  atm.  NTC  behavior  was 
evident from ∼850 – 10 0 0 K. Predictions of ignition delay times 
for 2-butyltetrahydrofuran were compared to other C8 species: n - 
octane [411] , 1-octanol [548] , and n -butyl ether [968] . None of the 
four  trends  overlapped  one  another  over  the  range  of  tempera- 
tures simulated (650 – 1250 K), which underscores the complex-

ity of functional group chemistry. Below 775 K, the ignition delay 
times trends were of the order: di- n -butyl ether < n -octane < 2- 
butyltetrahydrofuran < 1-octanol. 

The  core  mechanism  of  [968]  is  built  from  the  base  mech- 
anism  of  Blanquart  et  al.  [980] .  Additional  ether-related  chem- 
istry is adapted from tetrahydrofuran [ 961 , 967 ] and other cyclic 
ethers [ 950 , 981 ]. Using the CBS-QB3 composite method, Cai et al. 
[968]  expanded  on  prior  work  by  calculating  barrier  heights  for 
ring-opening of initial  ˙ R radicals to include in the mechanism. For 
both types of α radicals, i.e. secondary and tertiary, ring-opening 
via C–O bond-scission requires ∼23 kcal/mol, which is lower than 
the barrier height for the other radicals by 8 – 12 kcal/mol. No- 
tably, peroxy radical formation and related chain reactions of prod- 
ucts  from  ring-opening  was  included  in  the  development  of  the 
mechanism, which resulted in shorter ignition delay times by 20 
– 30% in the NTC region ( ∼750 – 900 K). As a class of reactions, 
the inclusion of radical ring-opening appeared in sensitivity anal- 
ysis  calculations  and  inhibited  ignition  delay  times  to  a  similar 
degree as the formation of cyclic ether from unimolecular  ˙ Q OOH 
decomposition. Because of an absence of speciation studies on 2- 
butyltetrahydrofuran, however, open questions remain such as the 
extent to which the alkyl chain interacts with the ether ring dur- 
ing oxidation and the importance of products from ring-opening 
reactions. 

3.5.3. Di-substituted tetrahydrofuran 

Chakravarty  and  Fernandes  [80]  report  the  only  computa- 
tional  study  on  2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran  relevant  to  combus- 
tion.  Total  high-pressure-limit  rate  coeﬃcients  for  H-abstraction 
by  HO ˙ O  were  calculated  at  the  CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/cc-pVTZ 
level  of  theory  with  torsional  mode  treated  using  RRHO,  Pitzer- 
Gwinn,  1D-Schrödinger,  and  1D  free  rotor  approximations.  Tun- 
neling  effects  were  also  accounted  for  using  the  unsymmetrical 
1D  Eckart  approximation  [982] .  The  CBS-QB3  method  was  also 
used  and  signiﬁcant  differences  ( ∼10 1 )  with  the  coupled  cluster 
method were noted. In addition, the approximation for torsional 
energy  of  internal  rotors  led  to  differences  of  ∼10 2  – ∼10 3 .  To- 
tal  high-pressure-limit  rate  coeﬃcients  were  also  calculated  for 
2-methyltetrahydrofuran  and  methylcyclopentane  in  order  to  as- 
sess  the  inﬂuence  of  molecular  structure.  Figure  106  shows  the 
rate  coeﬃcients  for  all  three  species  from  500  – 10 0 0  K  over 
which  2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran  is  ∼10 1  higher  than  for  2- 
methyltetrahydrofuran,  which  is  likely  due  to  the  additional  ter- 
tiary hydrogen since the barrier heights were nearly identical for 
analogous reactions in the two ethers. The rate coeﬃcients for both 
ethers are notably higher than for methylcyclopentane, nearly 10 2 

higher in the case of 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran. Site-speciﬁc rate 
coeﬃcients were also calculated and indicated that abstraction of 
hydrogen from α carbon is the only kinetically signiﬁcant channel 
below ∼900 K. With increasing temperature, abstraction from the 
methyl group becomes relevant, nearly equal to abstraction from α
carbon above 10 0 0 K. 

Sudholt  et  al.  [953]  conducted  derived  cetane  number 
(DCN)  measurements  of  2,3-dimethyltetrahydrofuran  and  2,5- 
dimethyltetrahydrofuran, the results of which indicated that sub- 
stituent proximity signiﬁcantly impacts reactivity. The DCN of 2,3- 
dimethytetrahydrofuran  (20)  was  ∼20%  higher  compared  to  the 
other isomer (15.6). Fenard et al. [983] developed the ﬁrst chem- 
ical  kinetics  mechanism  and  conducted  a  comprehensive  study 
on  2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran  combustion.  Ignition  delay  times 
were  measured  using  a  shock  tube  from  10  – 40  atm  and  an 
RCM  from  10  – 20  atm.  NTC  behavior  was  observed.  Specia- 
tion measurements were also reported from the RCM. Neither of 
the two HOO-elimination products (2,5-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrofuran 
and  2,5-dimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran)  were  detected  due  to  issues 
with chromatographic separation. Similar to Fenard et al. [959] for 
tetrahydrofuran,  ˙ Q OOH ring-expansion and ring-opening reactions 
were  reported.  In  the  case  of  2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran,  ring- 
expansion led to 2,4-dimethyl-4 H -1,3-dioxine and hexa-2,5-dione 
was formed via  ˙ Q OOH ring-opening. Products from ring-opening 
reactions of initial  ˙ R radicals were also observed, which included 
alkenes and carbonyl radicals via C–C β-scission of carbonyl radi- 
cals, e.g. 2-hexanon-5-yl → propene + acetonyl. 

Figure  107  compares  stoichiometric  ignition  delay  time  sim- 
ulations  at  20  atm  using  mechanisms  for  tetrahydrofuran  [959] ,

2  mole fractions were ∼0.76. 
2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran [983] . N 
The longer ignition delay times for 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran is 
due in part to the lack of ketohydroperoxide formation pathways 
involving α carbon – the same explanation for the reason that low- 
temperature  ignition  times  of  2-methyltetrahydofuran  are  longer 
than for 3-methyltetrahydrofuran (cf. Figure 105 ). 

3.5.4. Tetrahydropyran 

Rotavera  et  al.  [951]  conducted  MPIMS  experiments  to  de- 
termine  the  inﬂuence  of  the  ether  group  in  tetrahydropyran  on 
chain-inhibiting reactions, i.e.  ˙ R + O 
2 → conjugate alkene + HO ˙ O , in 
comparison  to  cyclohexane.  The  latter  produces  only  one  such 
alkene  (cyclohexene),  while  tetrahydropyran  produces  two  (3,4- 
dihydro-2 H -pyran and 3,6-dihydro-2 H -pyran). Branching fractions 
were  measured  from  50 0  – 70 0  K  and  were  used  to  infer  the

effect of the ether group on the production of the set of conju- 
gate alkenes. Below 700 K, chain-termination is favored in tetrahy- 
dropyran due to coupled effects of (1) lower C–H bond energy of 
α carbon, which leads to α-tetrahydropyranyl being the dominant 
initial radical, and (2) lower barrier to direct HO ˙ O formation on the 
α-tetrahydropyranyl + O 
2 surface (by ∼5 kcal/mol). With increasing 
temperature, however, competition from α-tetrahydropyranyl ring- 
opening reduces the ﬂux through  ˙ R + O 
2 and subsequent product 
formation thereafter – an effect compounded by the fact that ab- 
straction at the weakest C–H bond produces the initial radical most 
amenable to ring-opening. In contrast, analogous ring-opening re- 
actions of cyclohexyl were not evident and are not relevant un- 
til  ∼800  K  [303] .  The  results  in  Rotavera  et  al.  [951]  highlight 
the fact that the ether group facilitates chain-inhibiting via HOO- 
elimination  at  lower  temperature,  whereas  towards  higher  tem- 
perature the network of oxidation reactions grows more complex 
due to weak C–O bonds in α radicals that enable ring-opening re- 
actions to become dominant. Subsequent reaction mechanisms of 
radicals produced from cyclic ether ring-opening remain an open 
question. Similar conclusions were drawn in measurements of  ˙ O H 
and HO ˙ O time histories in Chen et al. [309] . 

Davis et al. [522] also conducted MPIMS experiments on cyclo- 
hexane and tetrahydropyran, at two pressures (10 Torr and 1520 
Torr)  and  three  temperatures  (500  K,  600  K,  and  700  K)  to  de- 
termine  the  effect  of  the  ether  group  on  ketohydroperoxide  for- 
mation. Branching fractions of acyclic species were quantiﬁed and 
provided conﬁrmation that ring opening of  ˙ Q OOH radicals, which 
ultimately diminishes second-O 
2 -addition reactions, was more pro- 
nounced  in  tetrahydropyran  than  in  cyclohexane.  In  addition  to 
branching fractions, species time proﬁles were also measured and 
a  notable  difference  in  the  temperature  dependence  of  ketohy- 
droperoxide  signal  was  observed.  In  cyclohexane  experiments  at 
1520 Torr, ion signal at m/z 130 (corresponding to C 
3 ) was 
evident  at  both  600  K  and  700  K.  In  contrast,  and  as  a  result 
of  ˙ Q OOH ring-opening, ketohydroperoxide ion signal from tetrahy- 
dropyran ( m/z 132, C

The  main  conclusion  drawn  in  Davis  et  al.  [522]  is  the  im- 
portance  of  both  ˙ R  and  ˙ Q OOH  radical  ring-opening  in  tetrahy- 
dropyran  oxidation,  which  depletes  to  some  extent  the  al- 
ready  low  steady-state  concentration  of  ˙ Q OOH.  Four  path- 
ways  were  connected  to  unimolecular  reactions  of  ˙ Q OOH  in 
[522]  ( Figure 108 ):  (a)  γ - ˙ Q OOH → pentanedial + ˙ O H,  (b)  γ - 
˙ Q OOH → vinyl  formate + ethene + ˙ O H,  and  (c  – e)  γ - ˙ Q OOH → 3- 
butenal + formaldehyde + ˙ O H. Carbon balance calculations revealed 
that  products  from  ring-opening  accounted  for  > 70%  at  10  Torr 
and  > 55%  at  1520  Torr.  Analogous  reaction  mechanisms  leading 

74 

to similar intermediates from cyclohexane oxidation were exam- 
ined in Davis et al. [522] to determine the extent to which ring- 
opening reactions were inﬂuenced by the ether group. On the basis 
of mass spectra measurements, no products from ring-opening re- 
actions of cyclohexane-derived radicals were identiﬁed at the con- 
ditions of the experiments. The absence of products from such re- 
actions,  coupled  with  the  detection  of  ketohydroperoxide  signal 
at higher temperature than from tetrahydropyran oxidation, indi- 
cates that the ether group introduces ring-opening pathways that 
deplete  ˙ Q OOH  radicals  that  may  otherwise  react  via  second-O 
2 - 
addition. 

Dagaut et al. [984] measured ignition delay times for tetrahy- 
dropyran in a shock tube and species proﬁles in a jet-stirred reac- 
tor and also developed the ﬁrst detailed chemical kinetics mech- 
anism  for  pressure  and  temperature  ranges  of  2  – 10  atm  and 
80 0 – 170 0 K, respectively. Labbe et al. [985] conducted specia- 
tion measurements on low-pressure ﬂames and expanded on the 
mechanism  of  Dagaut  et  al.  [984]  using  unimolecular  quantum- 
RRK theory to calculate ring-opening rates of initial radicals. Tran 
et  al.  [986]  studied  the  pyrolysis  and  high-temperature  ignition 
and ﬂame properties of tetrahydropyran. Tran et al. [986] also con- 
structed a detailed chemical kinetics mechanism covering a broad 
parameter space in temperature, pressure, and concentration. 

Ignition delay time measurements are not reported for tetrahy- 
dropyran below 10 0 0 K. The shock tube measurements of Dagaut 
et al. [984] spanned ∼1100 – 1580 K. In contrast, low-temperature 
ignition delay times were measured for cyclohexane in Lemaire et 
al. [ 987 , 988 ] from 600 – 900 K using an RCM, and in Daley et al. 
[ 987 , 988 ] from 850 – 1270 K using a shock tube. In addition, the 
three chemical kinetics mechanisms that exist for tetrahydropyran 
[984-986] were developed for ﬂame conditions and do not include 
peroxy radical chemistry. Therefore, open questions remain as to 
the effect of the ether group on ignition delay times in the ox- 
idation of 6-membered cyclic ethers. The impact of ring-opening 
reactions inhibiting ketohydroperoxide formation may lead to di- 
minished NTC behavior compared to cyclohexane. 

3.5.5. Furans 

Simmie and Curran [989] conducted ab initio calculations using 
three  quantum  chemical  methods  (CBS-QB3,  CBS-APNO,  and  G3) 
on bond dissociation energies and enthalpies of formation for sev- 
eral alkyl-substituted furans. C–H bond energies of ∼120 kcal/mol 
were  computed  and  the  high  value,  relative  to  abstraction  of  H 
atoms from saturated systems, was ascribed to an inability of the 
resulting  radical  to  delocalize  the  unpaired  electron.  In  a  subse- 
quent series of calculations, Feller and Simmie [990] utilized the

dimethyltetrahydrofuran. Owing to high C–H bond dissociation energies [ 989 , 990 ] 
and resonance-stabilization, the aromatic ring minimizes the role of peroxy radical 
chemistry. 

Feller-Petersen-Dixon method [991] to conduct calculations on en- 
thalpies of formation for 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2-methylfuran, and fu- 
ran.  Because  of  the  unsaturated  ring  in  furans  ( Figure  109 )  and 
the  endothermicity  of  H-abstraction  [989] ,  peroxy  radical  chem- 
istry leading to second-stage ignition is not observed. The lack of 
low-temperature chemistry makes furans suitable blending compo- 
nents for increasing eﬃciencies of premixed combustion systems 
[ 19 , 779 , 992 ] at levels of only 10% (vol.) [19] . 

High-temperature  studies  of  furan  and  alkyl-substituted  fu- 
ran are abundant, including pyrolysis [993-997] and ﬂame struc- 
ture  [ 981 ,  998–1002 ].  Ignition  delay  time  measurements  are  re- 
ported for furan [ 1003 –1005 , 969 ], 2-methylfuran [ 970 , 972 , 1001 –
1003 , 1005 , 1006 ], 2,3-dimethylfuran [969] , and 2,5-dimethylfuran 
[ 1003 , 1005 –1009 ]. Qian et al. [1010] reviewed the status of 2,5- 
dimethylfuran  related  to  both  production  and  utilization.  In  all 
cases,  the  ignition  delay  time  trends  do  not  exhibit  NTC  behav- 
ior,  indicating  that  ˙ Q OOH-mediated  chemistry  is  unimportant  in 
furans. Despite the lack of low-temperature chemistry in furan ox- 
idation,  combustion  studies  of  individual  species  below  10 0 0  K 
include furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran. The sections 
below are organized into ﬁve parts: rate coeﬃcients for initiation 
reactions,  speciation  measurements,  reaction  mechanisms  of  fu- 
ranyl radicals, ignition delay times, and chemical kinetics model- 
ing. 

Whelan et al. [1011] conducted laser induced ﬂuorescence spec- 
troscopy experiments to measure rate coeﬃcients for reactions of 
˙ O H with furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran at tempera- 
tures up to 770 K and pressures up to 10 atm, which were comple- 
mented with master equation calculations. Rate equations and Troe 
ﬁtting  parameters  were  produced  by  including  measurements  in 
the literature at other conditions. Addition reactions of  ˙ O H to only 
one location on each species – secondary α carbon in furan and 
tertiary α carbon in methylated furans – were considered in the 
kinetics modeling. The theoretical rates were consistent with the 
measurements and revealed that pressure dependence is weak and 
that (barrierless)  ˙ O H-addition is the major channel over abstrac- 
tion below 10 0 0 K, even for 2,5-dimethylfuran where six primary 
C–H bonds are present that otherwise yield a resonance-stabilized 
radical upon abstraction. The lack of pressure dependence is as- 
cribed to the formation of a ring-opened, resonance-stabilized rad- 
ical submerged ∼43 kcal mol –1 below the entrance channel. 

Rate coeﬃcients for  ˙ O H + furan were measured in shock tube 
experiments from 1 – 2 atm in Elwardany et al. [1012] over the 
temperature range 924 – 1388 K. Wine and Thompson [1013] mea- 
sured  the  temperature  dependence  of  ˙ O H + furan  at  900  Torr  in 
Ar over the temperature range 254 – 425 K using time-resolved 
resonance  ﬂuorescence  spectroscopy.  Rate  coeﬃcients  were  also 
measured  in  [1012]  for  ˙ O H + 2-methylfuran  from  890  – 1333  K 
and  in  Kim  et  al.  [1014]  from  948  – 1327  K  at  similar  pres- 
sures.  The  latter  work  applied  a  two-step  hierarchical  Bayesian 
method  to  calibrate  the  experimentally  determined  rate  param- 
eters of the reaction  ˙ O H + 2-methylfuranyl → products. Elwardany 
et  al.  [1012]  report  the  only  rate  coeﬃcient  measurements  of 
˙ O H + 2,5-dimethylfuran → products,  which  were  conducted  from 
915 – 1278 K and from 1 – 2 atm. Friese et al. [1015] measured 

75 

rate coeﬃcients in shock tube experiments from 970 – 1240 K and 
from  1.6  – 4.8  atm  for  ˙ H + 2,5-dimethylfuran  reactions.  Comple- 
mentary calculations conﬁrmed that addition-elimination – yield- 
ing 2-methylfuran + ˙CH 

3 – was the primary reaction channel. 

Only  a  limited  number  of  experimental  studies  on  speciation 
from low-temperature oxidation of furans exist [ 970 , 1016 –1019 ]. 
Speciation  measurements  were  conducted  on  furan  oxidation  in 
a  stirred  reactor  by  Thornton  et  al.  [1016]  at  1  atm  from  10 0 0 
– 1300  K.  Product  formation  was  detected  near  1100  K  and  in- 
cluded  species  like  acetylene,  ethene,  and  formaldehyde,  among 
others and oxidation mechanisms involving H-abstraction from fu- 
ran and disproportionation reactions with O 
2 leading to acetylene 
and others. Fathi and Meloni [1019] conducted MPIMS experiments 
on reactions of O( 3 P )-initiated oxidation of 2-methylfuran at 550 
K and 650 K at 7 Torr. Potential energy surfaces were also calcu- 
lated for O-atom addition to the ring using the CBS-QB3 compos- 
ite method. Primary products, identiﬁed using analysis of species 
time histories, were ascribed to addition reactions and accounted 
for the majority of product formation while H-abstraction reactions 
were minor. The addition of Ö atoms to the furan ring led to sin- 
glet epoxide species via intersystem crossing [ 1020 –1022 ] and de- 
rived from one of four triplet diradicals, which subsequently pro- 
duced formaldehyde, propene, 2-butenal, and methyl vinyl ketone 
as major products; alkynes 1- and 2-butyne, 1,3-butadiene, and 3- 
butenal were also quantiﬁed. [1019] . Alexandrino et al. [1018] con- 
ducted  ﬂow  reactor  experiments  on  2,5-dimethylfuran  oxidation 
2 , 
from 500 – 1400 K and from 1 – 40 atm. Species proﬁles for CO 
CO, ethene, and H 

2 were quantiﬁed. 

Tran et  al.  [970]  conducted  laminar ﬂow  reactor  experiments 
at  1  atm  from  730  – 1170  K  on  furan,  2-methylfuran,  and  2,5- 
dimethylfuran  using  20-eV  EI-MBMS.  Over  three  dozen  species 
were  identiﬁed,  including  products  from  ring-opening  reactions, 
such as acrolein and vinyl-acetylene, and higher molecular weight 
species, such as indane and naphthalene, indicating incipient soot 
formation processes. However, with the exception of furfural and 
5-methylfurfural,  potentially  from  RO ˙ O + RO ˙ O  reactions,  species 
containing two oxygen atoms, indicating product formation from 
˙ Q OOH chemistry, were not detected. Similar results were reported 
in Somers et al. [1007] on 2,5-dimethylfuran oxidation using a jet- 
stirred reactor and shock tube experiments. However, peroxy rad- 
ical chemistry of furans may hold relevance for oxidative stability 
when used as blending components [1023] . As with other alkylated 
species, furans with longer alkyl chains, e.g. n -butylfuran [952] , are 
more likely to display NTC chemistry as the number of secondary 
C–H bonds increase and favorable RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH reactions are en- 
abled. 

Theoretical  studies  on  reaction  mechanisms  of  furans  include 
˙ O H + furan [ 1024 –1026 ], O 
2 + 2-methylfuran radicals [ 1027 –1029 ], 
˙ O H + 2-methylfuran [ 1026 , 1027 , 1030 ],  ˙ O H + 3-methylfuran [1031] , 
˙ O H + 2,5-dimethylfuran [1026] , and  ˙ O H + 2-ethylfuran [1032] . Re- 
actions  of  furans  with  ˙ O H  lead  predominantly  to  addition  to  α
carbon and, subsequently, to the formation of ring-opened radicals 
[ 1024 –1026 ]. The potential energy surfaces in Yuan et al. [1026] in- 
dicate that  ˙ O H reaction with furans proceeds via a complex that 
leads to a chemically activated OH-substituted furan radical, which 
can undergo collisional stabilization or ring-opening to resonance- 
stabilized E / Z conformers that are able to interconvert. Upon reac- 
tion with O 
2 , the ring-opened radicals can form dicarbonyl species, 
e.g. E -butenedial and Z -butenedial in the case of furan. Because of 
the lack of chain-branching and generation of  ˙ O H in the oxidation 
of furans, the relevance of such ring-opening reactions at combus- 
tion conditions remains unclear. At a minimum, however, in the 
presence of other highly reactive species, furans may act as a radi- 
cal sink for  ˙ O H. 

Hudzik and Bozzelli [1028] conducted a series of thermochem- 
ical  and  kinetics  calculations  on  species  formed  from  2-methyl-

2  reactions  using  a  combination  of  CBS-QB3,  M06- 
2X/6-31G( d , p ), MP2, and PM3 levels of theory. The well-depth of 
the RO ˙ O adduct was 51 kcal/mol below the entrance channel and 
the  energetically  favorable  pathway  was  abstraction  of  hydrogen 
from the methyl group, which led via a ring-expansion mechanism 
to 4-methyl-1,3-dioxane-2-one [1028] . Temperature- and pressure- 
dependent rate coeﬃcient parameters were also calculated using 
QRRK and master equation analysis. Li and Cao [1029] conducted 
2 -addition to 
a series of pressure-dependent rate calculations for O 
radicals of 2-methylfuran. 

Davis  and  Sarathy  [1027]  calculated  potential  energy  sur- 
faces  and  rate  coeﬃcients  for  reactions  of  ˙ H  and  ˙ O H  with  2- 
methylfuran  over  the  temperature  range  30 0  – 20 0 0  K.  Since 
˙ O H + 2-methylfuran  reactions  are  barrierless,  addition  reactions 
were favored energetically over abstraction reactions. Correspond- 
ingly, rate coeﬃcients were calculated for subsequent reactions of 
OH-substituted  2-methylfuranyl  radicals  with  O 
2  using  CBS-QB3 
and  G4  methods.  cis -/ trans -  effects,  with  respect  to  –OH  and  –
O ˙ O  groups,  were  accounted  for.  In  the  RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH  transition 
states for cis - isomers, intramolecular hydrogen bonding between 
the two groups provided ∼3 kcal/mol stabilization. Preceding re- 
2 ,  addition  of  ˙ O H  to  α carbon  on  the  furan  ring 
action  with  O 
produces resonance-stabilized radicals, whereas addition to β car- 
bon yields non-resonance-stabilized radicals. On the potential en- 
ergy surface for the latter type of radicals, isomerization via ﬁve- 
membered  transition  states  and  concerted  elimination  of  HO ˙ O 
were favored. Barrier heights for isomerization/decomposition re- 
2 -addition  to  resonance-stabilized  radi- 
actions  stemming  from  O 
cals were all above the entrance channel. However, within the un- 
certainty of the methods, Waddington mechanisms were the low- 
est  lying  pathways.  An  alternative  Waddington  channel,  termed 
Waddington  elimination,  was  proposed  ( Figure  110 )  – the  simi- 
larity  to  the  conventional  channel  being  abstraction  of  hydrox- 
ylic hydrogen by the peroxy group and subsequent β-scission re- 
actions.  However,  the  difference  is  that,  instead  of  two  carbonyl 
species + ˙ O H, a multi-functional species is formed coincident with 
HO ˙ O rather than two carbonyl species and an  ˙ O H. 

Detailed  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  for  furan  were  devel- 
oped in Tian et al. [999] , Liu et al. [10 0 0] , and Tran et al. [970] . 
Similarly, mechanisms for 2-methylfuran were developed in Tran 
et al. [ 970 , 1002 ] and for 2,5-dimethylfuran in Somers et al. [1007] , 
Sirjean et al. [1009] , Togbé et al. [1001] , Alexandrino et al. [1018] , 
and Tran et al. [970] . The mechanism in Tran et al. [970] is a sin- 
gle, joint mechanism for the three furan species and incorporates 
chemistry relevant to low-temperature combustion, including re- 
actions of resonance-stabilized furanyl radicals with O 
2  and with 
HO ˙ O . 

tion reactions with  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O for tetrahydrofuran and methyl- 
substituted tetrahydrofuran species. 
Reactions  of  α radicals  with  O 

2  via  the  chain-inhibiting  step 
˙ R + O 
2 → conjugate alkene + HO ˙ O are favorable due to lower bar- 
rier heights. In addition, as a result of the selectivity towards α
radicals, an important aspect for both  ˙ R and  ˙ Q OOH radicals pro- 
duced from cyclic ethers is the propensity for radical ring-opening. 
In both cases, because of the adjacent unpaired electron, the C–O 
bond on the opposite side of the ether group is weakened. Subse- 
quent ring-opening of the  ˙ R radicals produces an aldehyde-alkyl 
radical,  e.g.  α-tetrahydrofuranyl → butan-4-yl-1-al.  Such  reactions 
2 -addition above ∼650 K. Similar ring-opening 
compete with ﬁrst O 
reactions of  ˙ Q OOH follow chain-propagation pathways by produc- 
ing an  ˙ O H radical. Both types of ring-opening ultimately decrease 
the rate of second O 
2 -addition reactions and chain-branching steps 
thereafter owing to the depletion of  ˙ Q OOH radicals. 

Rate coeﬃcient calculations of ﬁrst-O 

2 -addition to cyclic ether 
2 -addition to  ˙ Q OOH, both of which are impor- 
radicals or second-O 
tant to understand given the competition with ring-opening reac- 
tions,  are  absent  in  the  literature.  RO ˙ O  well-depths  of α peroxy 
radicals ( α-RO ˙ O ) are similar to alkylperoxy radicals ( ∼35 kcal/mol 
below the  ˙ R + O 
2 entrance channel) and are likely central to under- 
standing cyclic ethers. In addition to rates of formation of α-RO ˙ O , 
for  methyl-substituted  species  such  as  2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 
predicting  ratios  of  cis -/ trans -  RO ˙ O is  important  given  that  rates 
of α-RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH are isomer-dependent and because of the po- 
2 -addition, the 
tential for inversion reactions [947] . Upon second-O 
location of the methyl group relative to the peroxy group affects 
the ﬂux of radicals towards ketohydroperoxide formation. Notably, 
isomer-speciﬁc rates are not included for any species in chemical 
kinetics mechanisms at present, which may impact predictions of 
ignition delay times and species proﬁles. 

Several oxidation steps of cyclic ethers contribute to diminished 
NTC chemistry, as summarized in Figure 111 , which is augmented 
to emphasize pathways inﬂuenced by the ether functional group 
contrasted  against  the  low-temperature  chain-branching  scheme 
for alkanes. The main attributes of cyclic ether oxidation are favor- 
able ring-opening of α- ˙ R radicals, ring-opening and ring-expansion 
of  ˙ Q OOH, and facile HOO-elimination from both  ˙ R and  ˙ Q OOH, as 
well  as  from  ˙ O OQOOH.  Despite  weak  NTC  chemistry  in  all  the 
cyclic ethers for which measurements are reported – tetrahydro- 
furan, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and 3-methyltetrahydrofuran – ig- 
nition delay times in all cases are shorter than the corresponding 
cycloalkane analog. One plausible reason is larger rate coeﬃcients 
for H-abstraction from cyclic ethers by both  ˙ O H and HO ˙ O . Com- 
pounded with higher k (T) for the latter reaction, is facile produc- 
tion of HO ˙ O via RO ˙ O → conjugate alkene + HO ˙ O due to lower bar- 
rier heights when α carbon is involved. Low-temperature chain- 
branching in cyclic ethers is inhibited because of several reactions 
diminishing  an  already  low  steady-state  concentration  of  ˙ Q OOH, 
2 -addition. 
which  effectively  reduces  reaction  rates  for  second-O 
Speciﬁc  types  of  reactions  include  ring-opening  of  α- ˙ R ,  which 
forms an acyclic carbon-centered radical with a distant carbonyl 
group, and of  ˙ Q OOH (both starting near ∼650 K), and, in the case 
of tetrahydrofuran,  ˙ Q OOH ring-expansion that yields a closed-shell 
six-membered heterocyclic species + ˙ O H.

3.5.6. Summary of low-temperature oxidation of cyclic ethers 

Reaction  mechanisms  of  cyclic  ethers  are  relevant  to  under- 
standing  biofuel  combustion  chemistry  as  well  unimolecular  de- 
composition rates of  ˙ Q OOH radicals in alkane oxidation [ 430 , 947 ]. 
The presence of an ether group reduces C–H bond energies on α
carbon by 4 – 5 kcal/mol, whereas bond energies on other carbon 
atoms are similar to analogous sites in cycloalkanes. As a result, 
for temperatures below 10 0 0 K, α radicals are favored in initia- 

The sections below identify gaps in the understanding of func- 
tional group chemistry in relation to low-temperature combustion 
and  outline  research  directions  for  alcohols  ( Section  4.1 ),  esters 
( Section 4.2 ), ketones ( Section 4.3 ), acyclic ethers ( Section 4.4 ), and 
cyclic ethers ( Section 4.5 ). The main goal of the highlighted points 
is to summarize relevant experimental and computational studies 
necessary for improving the ﬁdelity of chemical kinetics mecha-

Fig. 111.  Summary of ether functional group effects on low-temperature chain-branching of cyclic species. The leftward-pointing and downward-pointing arrows indicate a 
shift in ﬂux away from chain-branching pathways responsible for ignition. Each type of initial radical is depicted in a separate plane, with different colors used as a guide. The 
alkane oxidation mechanism is depicted in the back plane for reference. Pathways that are enhanced by the effects of the functional group are emphasized with bold arrows 
and labels, and those that are diminished are made lighter or omitted. Hydrogen-abstraction from α carbon (adjacent to the ether group) introduces ring-opening of both  ˙ R 
and  ˙ Q OOH radicals, which may undergo unimolecular decomposition or reaction with O 2 and preclude second-O 2 -addition reactions that are required for chain-branching. 
HOO-elimination reactions are enhanced when involving hydrogen α carbon due to low C–H bond energy. 

nisms for prediction of biofuel oxidation mechanisms and ignition. 
Among  the  computational  studies,  continued  utilization  of  auto- 
mated transition state and reaction mechanism algorithms, includ- 
ing RMG [400] , Genesys [ 401 , 402 ], and KinBot [421] can facilitate 
progress and uncover new directions for chemistry, as shown in 
Grambow et al. [423] for 3-hydroperoxypropanal and in the Welz 
et al. [301] identiﬁcation of water-elimination reactions in alcohol 
oxidation, which was initially suggested from KinBot calculations 
on iso -pentanol oxidation chemistry [1033] . Elliott et al. [422] re- 
cently demonstrated the power of automated methods by applying 
a suite of automatic ﬁrst-principles quantum chemistry and rate 
coeﬃcient codes (AutoMech [1034] ) to generate predictive chemi- 
cal models for pyrolysis. 

Several  fundamental  chemistry  issues  are  common  among  all 

functional groups: 

- Only  a  limited  number  of  experimental  rate  coeﬃcient  mea- 
2 O + ˙ R for 

surements exist from ∼50 0 – 90 0 K for  ˙ O H + RH → H 
species of all functional group types. 

- Direct  experimental  measurements  of  rate  coeﬃcients  for 

HO ˙ O + RH → H 

2 O 

2 + ˙ R do not exist for any biofuel species. 

- Uncertainties in branching fraction calculations for initiation re- 
actions  with  ˙ O H  and  HO ˙ O  are  non-negligible  in  most  cases, 
even  for  cases  where  total  rate  coeﬃcients  are  consistent, 
and  exhibit  a  dependence  on  the  level  of  theory  utilized,  as 
shown for alcohols ( Section 3.1.1 ), esters ( Section 3.2.1 ), ketones 
( Section 3.3.1 ), and ethers ( Sections 3.4.1 and Section 3.5 ). How- 
ever, the effects of variation in branching fractions on chemi- 
cal kinetics mechanisms remain unaddressed and is potentially 
important for accurate predictions of ignition delay times and 
species proﬁles predictions. 

- The addition of radicals ( ˙ R or  ˙ Q OOH) to O 

2  is barrierless and 
diﬃcult to calculate rigorously because of inaccuracies in deter- 
mining the interaction energies along the reaction path. Gold- 
smith et al. [1035] showed that the use multireference methods 
can produce reliable results for reactions of hydrocarbon radi- 

77 

2 [ 1035 , 1036 ]. Accurate kinetics measurements and 
cals with O 
high-level calculations of biofuel derived radical additions to O 
2 
will be valuable for establishing the foundational reactions of 
low-temperature combustion. 

- Application of local and global uncertainty and sensitivity anal- 
ysis [ 864 , 1037 –1039 ], uncertainty propagation and minimiza- 
tion methods [1040] , and machine learning [ 1041 –1044 ] are vi- 
tal for reﬁning detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms of bio- 
fuels  given  the  complexity  introduced  by  functional  groups, 
particularly since rate rules are often relied upon for produc- 
ing  ﬁrst-generation  mechanisms.  As  an  example,  Agbro  and 
Tomlin [1045] applied global sensitivity analysis to predictions 
of  low-temperature  ignition  delay  time  measurements  using 
a  1-butanol  mechanism,  which  provided  clear  constraints  for 
branching fractions of  ˙ O H + 1-butanol → H 

2 O + ˙ R . 

- The role of accurate thermochemistry for intermediate species 
related  to  the  formation  and  decomposition  of  ˙ Q OOH  and  of 
˙ O OQOOH is signiﬁcant, as shown for alkanes [710] and ethers 
[ 1046 , 1047 ]. Given the complexity of most species involved in 
reactions  of  the  two  radicals,  and  that  group  additivity  prin- 
ciples  are  only  of  limited  utility,  high-level  quantum  chemi- 
cal  calculations  are  needed,  particularly  for  those  related  to 
oxygenated biofuels given the limited amount of experimental 
measurements. Moreover, noting the limitations of group addi- 
tivity and that the majority of the acyclic species contain multi- 
ple torsional modes and distinct conformers, accurate thermo- 
chemistry requires multi-dimensional torsional scans/partition 
functions and conformer analyses to properly account for hy- 
drogen bonding and formation of quasi-cyclic species. 

- Grambow  et  al.  [423]  utilized  several  state-of-the-art  auto- 
mated transition-state search algorithms and discovered dozens 
of alternative reaction pathways for unimolecular decomposi- 
tion  of  the γ -ketohydroperoxide  formed  in  propane  combus- 
tion.  While  some  alternative  ketohydroperoxide  reaction  de- 
composition  are  proposed  based  on  experiments  [ 898 ,  961 ],

products  from  dissociation  pathways  competing  with  O–O 
bond-scission  identiﬁed  in  [423] ,  such  as  1,2-H 
2  elimina- 
tion and internally catalyzed enol-oxo tautomerization, remain 
largely uncharacterized. Speciation measurements of expected 
products from the proposed pathways are needed to determine 
the extent to which such reactions are relevant at combustion 
conditions.

- The detection, and to a larger extent quantiﬁcation, of multi- 
functional  ˙ Q OOH-mediated  species  remains  a  challenge  often 
encountered  due  to  a  lack  of  reference  measurements  of  ab- 
sorption cross-sections, absolute photoionization cross-sections, 
and  mass  spectra  [1048] .  Examples  include  pentanedial  pro- 
duced  from  tetrahydropyran  oxidation  [522] ,  2-methyloxetan- 
3-one produced from butanone oxidation [764] , and 2-methyl- 
4-butoxyoxetane produced from diethyl ether oxidation [901] . 
Advances in speciation diagnostics and theoretical methods to 
produce quantitative spectra are needed. 

- Speciation experiments are needed to aid in the understanding 
of the potential effects of functional groups on non-Boltzmann 
reactions discussed in Burke et al. [1049] and Goldsmith et al. 
[1050] for species derived from propane oxidation. 

- Functional group effects on third-O 

2 -addition reported for alka- 
nes [ 1051 –1053 ] remain largely unexplored in biofuel oxidation. 
Belhadj et al. [ 900 , 966 ] report species produced from multiple 
O 
2 -addition steps during oxidation of tetrahydrofuran [966] and 
diethyl ether [900] , yet quantiﬁcation remains a challenge. 

4.1. Alcohols 

- Uncertainties  in  branching  fractions  for  ˙ O H + ethanol  are  sig- 
niﬁcant  as  shown  in  Section  3.1.1.1  ( Figure 4 ) and in Olm et 
al. [460] and Glarborg et al. [464] . In addition to ethanol oxi- 
dation, accurate site-speciﬁc rate coeﬃcients for α and β car- 
bon are relevant because of the connection to abstraction re- 
actions  in  other  alcohols  that  are  inﬂuenced  by  pre-reaction 
complex formation. The net effect of branching fraction uncer- 
tainty on ignition delay time predictions of ethanol, however, 
is  potentially  negligible  given  the  relatively  simpler  reaction 
mechanisms compared with other alcohols in that both initial 
radicals predominantly form acetaldehyde + HO ˙ O upon reaction 
with O 

2 . 

- Several  quantum  chemical  studies  calculated  rate  coeﬃcients 
for  ˙ O H + 1-butanol → H 
2 O + ˙ R  in  the  high-pressure  limit  and 
consistently  show  that  α radicals  are  favored  most,  account- 
ing for ∼50 – 60% over the range 500 – 1000 K. However, un- 
certainties  in  branching  fractions  of  the  other  radicals,  β,  γ , 
and δ, are signiﬁcant and may reduce accuracy of chemical ki- 
netics  modeling  of  peroxy  radical  chemistry.  Additional  stud- 
ies are necessary to determine branching fractions in the ini- 
tiation step with  ˙ O H, perhaps examining the potential for de- 
pendence  on  quantum  chemical  methods.  Experimental  mea- 
surements  may  also  provide  experimental  boundary  condi- 
tions for theoretical studies, such as OH-initiated H-abstraction 
from 1-butanol-1,1-d 
2 OH) or 1-butanol-4,4,4- 
2 CH 
2 OH).  The  impact  of  accurately  modeling 
3 CH 
d 
branching fractions on mechanism ﬁdelity for 1-butanol is po- 
tentially signiﬁcant given the complexity of the reaction mech- 
anisms unfolding across the four  ˙ R + O 
2  potential energy sur- 
faces.

- No studies exist for abstraction reactions of  ˙ O H or HO ˙ O with 1- 
pentanol. Branching fractions for  ˙ O H + 1-butanol calculated by 
Zhou et al. [433] show that the formation of δ radicals are rel- 
evant below 10 0 0 K, owing to the formation of a pre-reaction 
complex. An open question remains as to the degree of inter- 
action between carbon at the ε position and whether the in- 

78 

teraction between the abstracting radical and the –OH group is 
localized on carbon in the α – δ range. 

- No rate coeﬃcient measurements exist for reactions of  ˙ O H with 
unsaturated branched alcohols prenol and iso -prenol, which are 
relevant both as biofuel [ 147 , 150 , 194 , 197 , 204 , 205 ] and as 
primary oxidation intermediates of iso -pentanol [295] . Xing et 
al. [482] reported the lone set of high-pressure limit rate coef- 
ﬁcients for  ˙ O H-initiated H-abstraction from iso -pentanol. 

2 [497] and 2-methylpropan-1-ol-1-yl + O 

- Although  the  most  abundant  radicals  produced  in  the  initia- 
tion step, α radicals are not expected to undergo O 
2 -addition 
reactions  based  on  quantum  chemical  calculations  for  hy- 
droxyethyl + O 
2 [501] . 
However,  what  remains  unclear  is  the  potential  for  RO ˙ O  sta- 
bilization in reactions with radicals from larger alcohols with 
a  larger  number  of  vibrational  modes,  such  as  1-pentanol  or 
iso -pentanol,  which  may  render  α- ˙ R + O 
2 → α-RO ˙ O  (and  sub- 
sequent  α-RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH)  an  important  set  of  reactions.  The 
methodology  of  Burke  et  al.  [1049]  and  Goldsmith  et  al. 
[1050] for quantifying non-Boltzmann distribution effects of re- 
actants on product branching fractions may contribute to the 
understanding of α- ˙ R + O 
2  association reactions, as shown for 
˙ Q OOH ∗ + O 
2 occurring in n -propyl oxidation [1049] and for de- 
composition reactions of 3-hydroperoxypropanal [1050] . 

2 H 

- As shown in Welz et al. [296] for 1-butanol oxidation, water- 
elimination  reactions  are  low-lying  pathways  on  ˙ R + O 
2  sur- 
faces for β, γ , and δ radicals. Rate calculations using master 
equation  methods  for  unimolecular  reactions  of  oxy  radicals 
from water-elimination pathways may improve predictions of 
low-temperature formation of CO, CH 
2 O, and other intermedi- 
ates. Welz et al. [296] calculated barrier heights for unimolecu- 
lar decomposition of 4-oxybutanal and 2-oxybutanal. Pathways 
to two product pairs on the 4-oxybutanal surfaces were low- 
5 + glyoxal and H ˙CO + propanal. For 2-oxybutanal, C–
lying:  ˙C 
C  β-scission  led  to  propan-1-al-3-yl + CH 
2 O  and  to  propan- 
1-ol-3-yl + CO;  the  latter  via  an  isomerization  step  wherein 
aldehydic  hydrogen  is  abstracted  by  the  terminal  oxy  radi- 
cal,  forming  an  OH-substituted  carbonyl  radical.  Similar  re- 
actions  of  3-oxobutanal,  via  C–C  β-scission,  lead  to  vinoxy 
( ˙CH 

2 CHO) + acetaldehyde and to propan-2-ol-3-yl + CO. 
- In addition to conventional  ˙ Q OOH decomposition pathways, the 
–OH group in alcohols enables isomerization reactions involv- 
ing  abstraction  of  α hydrogen  from  non-terminal  oxygen  in 
the  –OOH  group.  As  an  example,  in  1-butanol  oxidation,  δ- 
RO ˙ O isomerization, in which hydrogen from the –OH group is 
abstracted,  leads  to  a  ˙ Q OOH  radical  HOO–CH 
2 ˙CH–OH. 
Decomposition  via  a  low-lying  OH-transfer  reaction  produces 
2 C(H) = O) + ˙ O H  in  a  chain- 
4-hydroxybutanal  (HO–CH 
2 CH 
propagating step. Analogous reactions are possible for γ -RO ˙ O 
in 1-butanol, which ultimately produces 3-hydroxybutanal + ˙ O H 
in a similar sequence of reactions, and for other alcohols. Ex- 
perimental detection of species from such alternative  ˙ Q OOH re- 
actions in alcohols are not reported. In addition, for 1-butanol, 
neither of the two mechanisms for which peroxy radical chem- 
istry is included (Sarathy et al. [511] and Vranckx et al. [435] ) 
account for alternative  ˙ Q OOH reactions, which may affect global 
˙ O H budgeting and impact the reliability of ignition delay time 
predictions.

- The  Vranckx  et  al.  [435]  mechanism  for  1-butanol  includes 
only  lumped  reactions  of  ˙ Q OOH,  leading  either  directly  to 
chain-branching  (producing  ˙ O H + ˙ O H + carbonyl-oxy  radical) 
or  decomposition  via  Waddington.  Only  the  Sarathy  et  al. 
[511] mechanism incorporates unique elementary reactions for 
˙ Q OOH → cyclic ether + ˙ O H. All six cyclic ether species were ac- 
counted for. However, the rate parameters were based on rate 
rule analogies with alkanes, and no experimental species pro- 
ﬁle  measurements  are  reported  in  the  literature  for  compar- 

B. Rotavera and C.A. Taatjes

ison.  Quantum  chemical  calculations  of  rate  coeﬃcients  for 
˙ Q OOH → cyclic  ether + ˙ O H  are  required,  in  addition  to  direct 
speciation measurements of cyclic ethers formed in alcohol ox- 
idation. 

- Quantum chemical calculations, similar to Sebbar et al. [760–
762]  conducted  for  branching  fractions  for  unimolecular  re- 
actions  of  butanone-derived  ˙ Q OOH  radicals,  are  not  reported 
for  alcohols.  The  results  of  such  calculations  could  provide 
improved chemical kinetics understanding of  ˙ Q OOH-mediated 
reactions  from  alcohol  oxidation,  which  are  potentially  more 
prominent in cases where second-O 
2 -addition and NTC behav- 
ior is less signiﬁcant since unimolecular reaction becomes the 
main decomposition channel. 

- No  speciation  measurements  are  reported  for  cyclic  alcohols, 
despite numerous synthesis routes for both cyclopentanol [190- 
193]  and  cyclohexanol  [206-211] ,  and  no  chemical  kinetics 
mechanism is available for the latter. 

- Ignition  delay  time  measurements  for  alcohols,  conducted  at 
the same conditions as analogous alkanes, are lacking. One ex- 
ception is comparison of ignition delay times of n -butane at 15 
atm against the four isomers of butanol ( Section 3.1.4.1 ). Addi- 
tional studies similar to Heufer et al. [98] could aid in reﬁning 
rate  coeﬃcients  prescribed  in  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms 
for  alcohols,  which  are  largely  constructed  using  rate  rules 
from  alkanes,  and  improve  predictive  capabilities  of  ignition. 
Example comparisons could include iso -butane/ iso -butanol, iso - 
pentanol/ iso -pentane, and iso -prenol/ iso -pentene. 

- Ignition delay times of cyclic alcohols are largely unexplored, 
with the exception of the cyclopentanol shock tube and RCM 
experiments of Cai et al. [552] , which led to the development 
of a chemical kinetics mechanism [549] . No ignition measure- 
ments are reported for cyclohexanol. Several studies exist for 
alkane analogs, cyclopentane [ 553 , 768 , 979 ] and cyclohexane 
[ 987 , 988 , 1054 –1056 ], which can provide for a direct compar- 
ison as to the impact of the –OH functional group on ignition 
delay times. 

4.2. Esters 

- Theoretical  kinetics  calculations,  focusing  on  branching  frac- 
tions  for  H-abstraction  from  esters,  are  needed  to  determine 
accurate quantum chemistry and the importance of explicitly 
treating  the  hydrogen-bonded  reactant  complex  (i.e.,  a  two- 
transition-state model). Section 3.2.1 reviews two cases involv- 
ing H-abstraction from methyl propanoate by  ˙ O H and by HO ˙ O , 
where such dependence may occur. 

- Given  the importance of  C = C bonds  to ester  reactivity  [377] , 
theoretical  calculations  are  needed  to  quantify  ˙ O H-addition 
rates  with  unsaturated  esters  particularly  for  polyunsaturated 
species, where bis -allylic hydrogen is present, and enable pre- 
dictions of the balance between addition and abstraction reac- 
tions at combustion-relevant temperatures and pressures. Sur- 
rogate molecules, such as 1,4-pentadiene, may provide a means 
for experimental measurement of such reactions. 

- In addition to α(cid:9)  and β(cid:9)  radicals in methyl esters, which are 
formed on the alkyl group and are favored most in  ˙ O H-initiated 
and  HO ˙ O -initiated  H-abstraction,  branching  fraction  calcula- 
tions  show  that  radical  formation  on  the  methoxy  group  is 
also important. An open question remains as to the competi- 
tion of such radicals, where the unpaired electron resides on 
the  alkoxy  portion  of  the  ester,  to  undergo  reaction  with  O 
2 
versus unimolecular decomposition via C–C β-scission. The lat- 
ter reaction yields formaldehyde and a formate radical, the de- 
composition of which directly yields CO + n -alkyl. For example, 
2 C( = O)O ˙CH 
in  methyl  butanoate,  decomposition  of  CH

- Because  chemical  kinetics  mechanisms  most  commonly  draw 
analogy  with alkanes for rate  parameters, theoretical calcula- 
tions of RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH isomerization rates comparing such re- 
actions in esters to analogous reactions in alkanes are needed 
to  determine  the  potential  impact  of  additional  strain  in  the 
transition state when the ester group is included. Glaude et al. 
[624] estimated the strain energy of cyclic transition states in- 
volving the ester group utilizing group additivity methods by 
considering  ring  strain  equal  to  the  enthalpy  of  reaction  in 
isodesmic reactions in which the cyclic structure is produced 
from a linear, unstrained structure. However, no high-level the- 
oretical calculations are reported. 

- Direct,  isomer-resolved  speciation  measurements  of  cyclic 
ethers  produced  from  ester  oxidation,  particularly  lactone 
derivatives that involve the ester group in the transition state, 
are  not  reported  for  the  majority  of  methyl  esters  and  are 
needed as validation targets for chemical kinetics mechanisms. 
One  exception  is  the  experiments  of  Glaude  et  al.  [624] ,  in 
which  substituted  oxolanes  were  measured  from  methyl  de- 
canoate oxidation. 

- Low-temperature oxidation chemistry of alkenyl chains in un- 
saturated esters, particularly reactions involving bis -allylic sites 
is largely unstudied. Because C = C bonds in practical esters are 
located  several  carbons  from  the  ester  group,  as  in  methyl 
oleate, methyl linoleate, and methyl linolenate, examining reac- 
tion mechanisms of dienes, such as 3,6-nonadiene, which per- 
mit RO ˙ O (cid:2) ˙ Q OOH isomerization that involve the C = C bonds, 
may provide necessary insight into the role of alkenyl chains in 
low-temperature oxidation of esters and lead to improved igni- 
tion modeling capabilities that account for competing radical- 
addition reactions and abstraction reactions. 

- To examine the potential for alkoxy groups to inﬂuence  ˙ Q OOH 
formation and chain-branching in ester oxidation, from the fa- 
cilitating of reactions across the ester group, ignition delay time 
measurements  for  methyl  esters  and  ethyl  esters,  conducted 
under  the  same conditions, are needed.  An  example may  in- 
clude the comparison between ignition delay times of methyl 
butanoate versus ethyl butanoate. Peroxy radical formation on 
the  terminal  carbon  of  an  ethoxy  group  in  ethyl  esters  en- 
ables  a  7-membered  transition  state  for  RO ˙ O → ˙ Q OOH,  while 
the analogous reaction starting from a methoxy group requires 
a 6-membered transition state. Both involve abstraction of hy- 
drogen  from  allylic  carbon  immediately  adjacent  to  the  ester 
group. 

- Only  a  limited  number  of  studies  exist  on  ethyl  esters,  none 
of which involve species larger than ethyl propanoate despite 
synthesis routes for larger ethyl esters [ 216 , 1057 , 1058 ]. 

4.3. Ketones 

- Other than the shock tube experiments of Liu et al. [741] , the 
lower  limit  of  which  was  900  K,  no  experimental  measure- 
ments are reported for rate coeﬃcients of  ˙ O H + cyclic ketones, 
and  theoretical  studies  on  cyclopentanone  [ 79 ,  724 ]  and  cy- 
clohexanone  [743]  show  differences  of  more  than  a  factor  of 
∼2 compared with the experiments. For  ˙ O H + cyclopentanone, 
branching  fractions  towards  the  two  radicals  – α and  β –
are  consistent  to  within  20%  between  the  two  studies  of 
Thion  et  al.  [ 79 ,  724 ]  and  Zhou  et  al.  [ 79 ,  724 ],  although 
the  total  rate  coeﬃcients  below  ∼750  K  are  within  a  fac- 
tor of ∼2. Measurements of k (T) for  ˙ O H + cyclopentanone and 
˙ O H + cyclohexanone, complementing the temperature range of 
Liu et al. [741] , could provide experimental benchmarks for ad- 
ditional quantum chemical calculations.

2 O 

- Rate coeﬃcients are not reported experimentally or computa- 
tionally for HO ˙ O + cyclohexanone H 
2 + ˙ R . The chemical kinet- 
ics mechanism developed in Thion et al. [743] utilizes rate coef- 
ﬁcients based on analogy to butanone (for abstraction of α car- 
bon) and to n -butane (for β and γ carbon). Because of the im- 
portance of the conjugate alkene formation channel in ketone 
oxidation, via  ˙ R + O 
2 , accurate rate coeﬃcients for abstraction 
by HO ˙ O are potentially signiﬁcant to modeling low-temperature 
oxidation pathways in cyclohexanone. 

- Despite  synthetic  pathways  for  the  production  of  2- 
methylcyclopentanone  [ 241 ,  242 ],  low-temperature  oxidation 
experiments and theoretical calculations are largely unexplored. 
Scheer  et  al.  [757]  conducted  the  single  set  of  experiments, 
utilizing  MPIMS  to  probe  product  formation  from  ˙ R + O 
2 
reactions.  Rate  coeﬃcients  for  abstraction,  by  ˙ O H  or  HO ˙ O , 
additional  speciation  experiments,  ignition  delay  times,  and 
chemical kinetics mechanism development are not reported for 
2-methylcyclopentanone. 

- With the exception of the series of QRRK calculations of Seb- 
bar et al. [760-762] on the three butanonyl radicals, which fo- 
cused  on  branching  fractions  related  to  ˙ R + O 
2  reactions,  no 
2 with other ketonyl radicals at 
studies exist for reactions of O 
combustion-relevant conditions. Quantum chemical calculations 
for other species, such as cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, 
could contribute to advancing chemical kinetics mechanism de- 
velopment for cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, particularly 
since most of the  ˙ Q OOH-mediated species from cyclic ketones 
form bicyclic structures that are diﬃcult to detect experimen- 
tally. 

- Speciation measurements of  ˙ Q OOH-mediated species from bu- 
tanone oxidation are required in order to conﬁrm several reac- 
tion pathways, including (i) the alternative γ - ˙ Q OOH decompo- 
sition mechanism postulated in Sebbar et al. [760] , leading to 
1-hydroxybut-3-en-2-one, (ii) the formation of the cyclic ether 
1-(oxiran-2-yl)ethan-1-one 2-butanon-4-peroxy [762] , and (iii) 
2-methyloxetan-3-one  formation  derived  from  2-butanon-3- 
peroxy  [764] ,  all  of  which  remain  unconﬁrmed  because  of  a 
lack of isomer-resolved measurements. Similarly, for cyclic ke- 
tones,  products  from  ˙ Q OOH-mediated  reactions  of  cyclopen- 
tanone and cyclohexanone are not reported in recent experi- 
mental  studies,  and  Zhang  et  al.  [767]  remarked  on  the  ne- 
cessity for such speciation measurements for improvement of 
chemical kinetics modeling of cyclopentanone. 

- Speciation measurements are not reported for acyclic ketones 
in  Table  1  other  than  butanone,  despite  synthetic  pathways 
for the production of 2-pentanone [ 118 , 177 , 227 , 229 ] and 5- 
methyl-2-hexanone [ 162 , 212 ]. 

- Ignition  delay  time  measurements  below  10 0 0  K  for  ketones 
in Table 1 include butanone, 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, di- iso - 
propyl ketone, and cyclopentanone. No such measurements ex- 
ist  for  cyclohexanone.  Given  the  development  of  a  chemical 
kinetics  mechanism  for  cyclohexanone  [743] ,  which  incorpo- 
rates  peroxy  radical  chemistry,  ignition  delay  time  measure- 
ments  are  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  providing  validation 
targets.  Moreover,  ignition  delay  time  measurements  for  ke- 
tones, conducted at similar conditions as to analogous alkanes, 
are lacking. Coordinated measurements on ketones and alkanes 
of similar molecular structure (e.g. methylcyclopentane and 2- 
methylcyclopentanone) enables improved understanding of ke- 
tone oxidation in the context of alkane oxidation upon which 
most ﬁrst-generation mechanism development is based.

reported 

2 O 

HO ˙O + diethyl ether → H 

in  modeling  low-temperature  oxidation  given  the  abundance 
of  HO ˙ O  formed  coincident  with  ethyl  vinyl  ether  via  ˙ R + O 
2 
reactions. 

- In  the  series  of  theoretical  calculations  on  dimethyl  ether, 
Andersen  and  Carter  [853]  note  that  VTST  calculations,  ac- 
counting for the intrinsic barrier of the O–O scission reaction, 
are required to conﬁrm selectivity towards hydroperoxymethyl 
formate  decomposition  via  O–O  scission,  leading  to  chain- 
branching, over the formic acid + H ˙CO + ˙OH pathway; Channels 
III and V, respectively, in Figure 77 . 

- In  dimethyl  ether  oxidation,  rate  coeﬃcients  are  needed  for 
several decomposition pathways of the lone ketohydroperoxide, 
hydroperoxymethyl formate. Speciﬁcally, the formic anhydride 
pathway (Channel II in Figure 77 ) and the performic acid path- 
way (Channel III in Figure 77 ). Both species were detected ex- 
perimentally in the JSR experiments of Moshammer et al. [344] . 
Although the barrier height is the highest among the decompo- 
sition channels, the detection of performic acid may arise from 
acid-catalyzed dehydration given the abundance of formic acid 
produced from dimethyl ether. Additional rate calculations for 
the latter reactions are also needed. 

- Theoretical calculations of rate coeﬃcients for ketohydroperox- 
ide decomposition channels in diethyl ether are needed, includ- 
ing  the  proposed  acetic  acid  and  acetic  anhydride  pathways, 
which were based on rate rules in the chemical kinetics mech- 
anism of Tran et al. [898] . Danilack et al. [943] computed rates 
for  conventional  ketohydroperoxide  reactions  in  diethyl  ether 
oxidation using a coupled set of master equations to account 
for non-Boltzmann effects. 

- Isomer-resolved  measurements  of  cyclic  ether  produced  from 
diethyl  ether  are  not  reported  and  are  needed  for  2- 
ethoxyoxirane,  2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxetane,  and  1,4-dioxane  to 
provide experimental targets for chemical kinetics modeling of 
the balance between unimolecular decomposition of  ˙ Q OOH and 
second-O 
2 -addition  reactions.  Tran  et  al.  [898]  quantiﬁed  2- 
methyl-1,3-dioxolane in JSR experiments using GC/MS. 

- Neither speciation measurements nor ignition delay times are 
reported  for  any  of  the  branched  ethers  in  Table  1  despite 
synthetic pathways: ethyl- tert -butyl ether [ 150 , 255-257 ], tert -

addition to radicals of cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, 2- 
methyltetrahydrofuran, and tetrahydropyran. 

- Because of facile ring-opening of cyclic ether radicals, when an 
unpaired electron is adjacent to the ether group, master equa- 
tion calculations are necessary to predict the balance of reac- 
tions  of  both  ˙ R  and  ˙ Q OOH  radicals  against  reaction  with  O

which were conducted on tetrahydrofuran using CBS-QB3. Rate

chemical kinetics mechanisms.

tant in predicting the balance of reactions in addition to the

is unclear as isomer-speciﬁc reactions of RO ˙ O radicals are not 
included in chemical kinetics mechanisms. In addition, branch-

speciation studies on tetrahydropyran exist below 10 0 0 K [ 522 , 
951 ]. Such measurements could provide clarity as to the effect 
of ring-opening of both  ˙ R and  ˙ Q OOH radicals. 

- Low-temperature sub-mechanisms are unavailable for tetrahy- 
dropyran radicals, despite development of three detailed chem- 
ical kinetics mechanisms [984-986] .

The combustion chemistry of biofuels remains a highly active 
area of research, and with the increasing abundance of viable op- 
tions, the scope of the research continues to broaden. An impor- 
tant  aspect  of  biofuels,  as  shown  in  the  present  review,  is  the 
magnitude  of  impact  that  functional  groups  can  impose  on  ig- 
nition.  As  a  result,  continued  integration  of  liquid  biofuels  for 
transportation energy purposes may not require complete displace- 
ment of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons and instead may utilize 
blending in small amounts. One broader objective is the develop- 
ment  of  modeling  capabilities  for  predicting  combustion  proper- 
ties  of  multi-component  biofuels  for  fundamental  understanding 
of blending effects. Because of the strength of the research and the 
advances in the theoretical and experimental capabilities, a general 
and rigorous description of the functional group dependence of au- 
toignition chemistry to achieve such an objective is within reach. 

5. Conclusion 

Declaration of Competing Interest 

The present review provides a historical account and summary 
of biofuel chemical kinetics relevant to chain-branching reactions 
in  combustion.  The  presence  of  oxygenated  functional  groups  in 
biofuels affects low-tem perature oxidation  steps that can im pact 
each step in the degenerate chain-branching mechanism, from ini- 
tiation  reactions,  reaction  rates  with  O 
2 ,  and  oxidation  mecha- 
nisms, all of which are highly coupled and directly control reactiv- 
ity and ignition. The primary effects include alterations in branch- 
ing fractions during the initiation step due to reduced C–H bond 
dissociation energies adjacent to the functional group, competing 
rates for  ˙ R decomposition versus ﬁrst-O 
2 -addition, which impacts 
2 (cid:2) RO ˙ O equilibria, the imposing of additional strain in the 
˙ R + O 
transition state for RO ˙ O (cid:2) ˙ Q OOH isomerization, and complex reac- 
tion mechanisms that are unique to a particular functional group. 
The  degree  of  inﬂuence  depends  on  both  the  type  of  functional 
group and the size of the aliphatic component of the biofuel struc- 
ture. 

The  review  focused  on  the  understanding  of  fundamental 
chemical  kinetics  of  biofuels  that  affects  the  sequence  of  reac- 
tions  leading  to  chain-branching  and  ignition  delay  times  in  or- 
der to develop robust, predictive computational models. The de- 
tails of each biofuel were contextualized against the corresponding 
alkane. Concerning validation experiments, because measuring all 
labile intermediate species, isomers, and conformers, is infeasible 
both qualitatively and quantitatively, certain types of species are 
likely to play more pivotal roles in serving as modeling targets for 
advancing the state of knowledge. As an example, more research is 
needed to understand the fate of intermediates formed from oxida- 
tion reactions of ﬁrst-O 
2 -addition reactions, such as cyclic ethers. 
The  balance  of  the  two  competing,  forward  pathways  for  ˙ Q OOH 
2 -addition) ultimately 
(i.e. unimolecular decomposition or second-O 
dictates reactivity characteristics of biofuels, which can differ sub- 
stantially from hydrocarbons. Therefore, unimolecular reactions of 
˙ Q OOH play critical roles in understanding low-temperature oxida- 
tion and in developing chemical kinetics mechanisms. 

Because of the importance of  ˙ Q OOH chemistry to the develop- 
ment of modeling capabilities for low-temperature combustion, a 
reasonable  expectation  is  that  uncertainty  in  the  balance  of  re- 
actions  involving  cyclic  ethers,  which  form  predominantly  from 
˙ Q OOH,  contributes  directly  to  uncertainty  in  predictions  of  au- 
toignition and species proﬁles of intermediates. Moreover, as newly 
identiﬁed species and pathways become evident in biofuel com- 
bustion, such as alternative reactions of  ˙ Q OOH and ketohydroper- 
oxides,  experimental  conﬁrmation  must  rely  on  quantum  chem- 
istry and theoretical chemical kinetics for quantitative predictions. 
One  effective  outcome  from  such  work  could  involve  the  devel-
