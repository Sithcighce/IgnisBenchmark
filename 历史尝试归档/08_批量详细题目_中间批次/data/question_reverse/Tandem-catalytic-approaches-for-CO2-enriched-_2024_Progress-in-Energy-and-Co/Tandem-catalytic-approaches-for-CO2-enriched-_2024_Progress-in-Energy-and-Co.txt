Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) allows the conversion of syngas to high-density liquid fuels, playing a key role in
the  petrochemical  and  global  energy  sectors  over  the  last  century.  However,  the  current  Global  Challenges
impose the need to recycle CO2 and foster green fuels, opening new opportunities to adapt traditional processes
like FTS to become a key player in future bioenergy scenarios. This review discusses the implementation of CO2-
rich streams and in tandem catalysis to produce sustainable fuels via the next generation of FTS. Departing from a
brief revision of the past, present, and future of FTS, we analyse a disruptive approach coupling FTS to upstream
and downstream processes to illustrate the advantages of process intensification in the context of biofuel pro-
duction  via  FTS.  We  showcase  a  smart  tandem  catalyst  design  strategy  addressing  the  challenges  to  gather
mechanistic insights in sequential transformations of reagents in complex reaction schemes, the precise control of
structure-activity  parameters, catalysts  aging-deactivation, optimization of reaction  parameters, as well  as  re-
action engineering aspects such as catalytic bed arrangements and non-conventional reactor configurations to
enhance the overall performance. Our review analysis includes technoeconomic elements on synthetic aviation
fuels as a case of study for FTS applications in the biofuel context discussing the challenges in market penetration
and potential profitability of synthetic biofuels. This comprehensive overview provides a fresh angle of FTS and
its  enormous  potential  when  combined  with  CO2  upgrading  and  tandem  catalysis  to  become  a  front-runner
technology in the transition towards a low-carbon future.

1. The potential of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

The widespread availability of energy has had a transformative effect
on human progress over the past several centuries. Not only new sources
of energy have been discovered, including fossil fuels, nuclear power,
hydropower,  and  more  recently,  various  renewable  technologies,  but
also  the  amount  of  energy  that  can  be  produced  and  consumed  has
increased  significantly.  As  depicted  in  Fig.  1A,  a  comparison  of  per
capita energy consumption in 2021 with that of 40 years prior reveals
this  consumption  growth.  During  this  period,  many  countries  have
doubled or even tripled their energy consumption [1]. This surge can be
attributed  to  the  technological  and  industrial  advancements  in
numerous nations, coupled with the extensive integration of technology
in households across the globe. The pursuit of Society 5.0 comes with a
significant energy cost, necessitating a constant and growing supply, in

tandem with demographic, economic, and circular factors. This energy
price has historically been paid through the consumption of fossil fuels
(oil,  coal,  and  gas).  Nevertheless,  the  mounting  concern  over  our
dependence  on  fossil  fuels,  combined  with  the  massive  release  of
greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2), is driving a transition in the energy sce-
nario. This transition is not only supported by social concern but also by
robust legislation (e.g., the Paris Agreement, the Innovation Fund, and the
US-China Glasgow Declaration) aiming to break the monopoly of fossil
resources in the energy sector, opening up a broader range of sustainable
possibilities [2–4]. Among the assorted options on the table, the use of
synthetic fuels is particularly intriguing.

Synthetic  fuels  are  “made-to-order”  fuels  designed  for  use  in  a
particular application. Their  production usually requires two  types of
building  blocks.  One  molecule  provides  the  necessary  carbon  to
construct the hydrocarbon skeleton (e.g., CO, CO2, methanol, etc.), and

another  molecule  is  responsible  for  providing  the  required  saturation
degree to the structure (e.g., H2). Considering the origin of the building
blocks used, synthetic fuels can be classified into various categories [5].
They can be categorized as biofuels (if derived from biomass), renewable
fuels  (obtained  from  renewable  sources  or  a  mixture  that  includes
biomass), or e-fuels (unrelated to biomass but still renewable). Among
the  available  processes
the
Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process stands out for its versatility in customizing
the  fuel, its adaptability  in  combination with other processes,  and its
historically proven reliability [6–11].

for  producing

synthetic

fuels,

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is a chemical process that converts
syngas (a mixture of CO and H2) into hydrocarbons [12,13]. Although it
can  produce  a  wide  array  of  value-added  chemicals  (e.g.,  waxes  and
lubricants),  the  main  focus  is  on  liquid  fuels  such  as  jet  fuel,  diesel,
kerosene,  and  gasoline  [14–17].  Unsurprisingly,  the  success  of  the
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) has been closely linked to the evolution
of oil prices over time as shown in Fig. 1B [18–21]. However, the current
changing  scenario  has  prompted  a  reappraisal  of  energy  policies  and
priorities,  renewing  interest  in  FTS  as  a  potential  alternative to  fossil
resources  due  to  environmental,  economic,  and  quality  standpoints
[22].

From an environmental standpoint, the production of synthetic fuel
through FTS presents key advantages over petroleum-derived fuel. Due
to  the  reagents  employed  in  the  synthetic  process,  the  release  of
greenhouse  gases  other  than  CO2  (e.g.,  SOx,  NOx)  is  minimized.
Although  other  gases  are  not  produced,  CO2  is  the  most  abundant
greenhouse gas, and its presence in the atmosphere has reached levels
that  cannot  be  naturally  regulated  [23–28].  In  Fig.  1C,  the  emission
trend along with population growth suggests that the emissions will only
continue  to  increase.  Hence,  it  is  crucial  to  mitigate  emissions  across
different sectors and strive to achieve complete decarbonization in areas
where the economy, infrastructure, and legislation permit it. This pur-
suit plays a vital role in the realization of the Society 5.0 ideal. In sectors
such as transportation, where mid-term decarbonization may not be a
readily achievable option, the responsible integration of synthetic fuels
presents an attractive alternative [29,30]. Moreover, if the origin of the
synthesis  gas  is  biomass-derived  and  renewable,  the  carbon  footprint
can  be  decreased,  potentially  leading  to  a  closed-loop  emission  cycle

what would be aligned with the social, bureaucratic and environmental
standards in our society.

From  an  economic  standpoint,  the  utilization  of  synthetic  fuel
derived  from  FTS  presents  several  strategic  advantages  over  conven-
tional fuels. The production of synthetic fuel is highly versatile, as it can
be derived from coal (coal-to-liquids, CTL process), gas (gas-to-liquids,
GTL process), power-to-liquids (PTL process), biomass (biomass-to-liq-
uids, BTL process), and waste (waste-to-liquids, WTL process), where the
anticipated production costs for BTL, CTL, GTL, and PTL fall within the
ranges of 28.28–35.09, 13.53–16.75, 6.16–7.86, and 20.72–30.17 $/GJ
(140–176,  62–79,  23–32,  and  100–150  $/bbl),  respectively  [31–34].
However,  GTL  emerges  with  the  lowest  production  cost,  primarily
attributed to the typically low values of gas feedstock giving 0.5–2 $ for
Million Standard Cubic Feet per Day, while conversely, BTL registers the
highest production cost due to challenges in scaling up and technolog-
ical immaturity. Similarly, PTL follows as the second highest, owing to
elevated prices of electricity and electrolyzers, and CTL is comparatively
deemed acceptable, although its production cost is higher than that of
GTL.  In  addition  to  its  versatility,  CTL  and  GTL  production  ensure
short-term continuity in fuel supply, as their reserves are more abundant
than those of petroleum. On the other hand, PTL, BTL and WTL offer
solutions for the short, medium, and long term, as they rely on renew-
able resources like biomass, waste, and renewable sources whose pro-
duction  is  cyclical  and  sustainable  over  time.  This  wide  array  of
possibilities  offered  by  FTS  allows  for  mitigating  fuel  market  fluctua-
tions in case of political instability in the producing countries and pre-
vents  significant  price  fluctuations  for  consumers,  as  seen  during  the
1973 oil embargo or the 2009 Great Recession (as shown in Fig. 1B) [35,
36].  By  having  more  diverse  and  resilient  fuel  sources,  excessive
dependence on oil is reduced, promoting greater energy and economic
stability globally [29,30].

From a quality standpoint, Table 1 presents a comparison between
synthetic crude obtained in the factory and petroleum crude [14]. One
notable advantage of FTS crude is the complete absence of sulphur and
nitrogen, which eliminates the necessity for the removal treatments of
heteroatoms required in conventional crude oil [11,14]. In addition, FTS
derived crude contains oxygenates as long carboxylic acids, which can
be desirable components in gasoline, while crude oil contains mixtures

and aromatics. The presence of olefins in FT syncrude also provides a
synthetic  capability  that  can  only  be  achieved  in  crude  oil  through
additional refining processes.

The future of hydrocarbon-based fuels is complex due to the ongoing
shift  towards  a  circular  bioeconomy  energy  scenario  [37–39].  In  this
scenario, replacing a linear energy consumption model with a circular
one  is  imperative  to  ensure  environmental  sustainability  (Fig.  2).
Although  synthetic  fuels  offer  numerous  advantages  over  fossil  fuels,
taking over the most profitable and lucrative energy source to date while
adapting to a new bioenergy model is a titanic task. Therefore, for FTS
technology to have a place in the future, it must evolve according to the
current  times,  adapting  to  the  new  energy  trend  while  preserving  its

1. Using CO2 as a building block in fuel synthesis. The main draw-
back associated with hydrocarbon-based fuels is the release of CO2.
Changing the role of CO2  from a passive and problematic position
(linear energy model) to an active role as a key player in fuel pro-
duction (circular model) can ensure its longevity in the energy sce-
nario [40–42]. Furthermore, by integrating CO2 into a bioeconomic
cycle, the carbon footprint could be drastically reduced rising the FT
fuels to a top position in the energy landscape [43,44].

2.  Intensifying  processes.  The  production  of  the  final  fuel  occurs
through processes of cracking, oligomerization, and isomerization in
different facilities. These processes offer the quality associated with
FT-fuel  but  increase production  costs.  Combining  all the  synthetic
crude upgrading processes and even performing them in the same
reactor where the crude is produced can make the production cost
more  competitive.  In  this  regard,  using  microreactors  can  be  an
attractive option compared to conventional reactors (e.g., slurry bed
reactors and fixed bed reactors). They leverage their excellent ther-
mal conductivity for efficient energy management and superior mass
transfer, both of which are key properties for intensifying this type of
process.

3.  Designing cost-effective tandem catalysts. Process intensification
in  FTS  demands  the  use  of  a  new  generation  of  nanoengineered
catalysts capable of maximizing selectivity towards a specific prod-
uct (e.g., jet fuel), achieving maximum feedstock conversion (e.g.,
CO2  and  H2),  ensuring  high  robustness,  and  excellent  durability.

2. A very brief introduction to FTS: the past, the present, and the
future

Fuels are among the most valuable resources in the world. Energy is a
vital component of all economies and life, and only a few nations are
self-sufficient in this regard. The rest has to rely on trade to meet their
energy needs. The production, commercialization, and exploitation of
fuels and their feedstocks have been a source of wealth, research and
development,  and  prosperity.  Historically,  the  role  played  by  the
Fischer-Tropsch  process  has  been  to  produce  liquid  fuels  when  the
supply of oil was scarce. This has led to the development, firstly, of CTL
technology followed by GTL and, more recently, BTL and WTL.

In the early 20th century, political instability in Europe due to the
impending World War I necessitated alternative sources of liquid fuel
production  apart  from  petroleum.  During  these  years,  Germany
possessed large coal deposits, which were valuable for powering heavy
industry and large machinery but not suitable for smaller engines like
those  in  cars,  trucks,  and  airplanes.  Faced  with  increasing  political
instability  and  dependence  on  foreign  oil  supplies,  the  German  gov-
ernment encouraged research into converting coal into liquid fuel. At
that time, high-pressure processes were in vogue, and two streams of
research gradually emerged for liquid fuel production [45].

On the one hand, Bergius initiated the direct liquefaction of lignite
(now known as the Pott-Broche process). On the other hand, the com-
pany  Badische  Anilin-und  Soda-Fabrik  (BASF)  delved  into  Bergius’s
work, searching for potential industrial applications. In this endeavour,
they  found  the  use  of  CO  and  H2  for  initial  catalytic  hydrogenation
potentially useful, particularly employing cobalt as a catalyst. However,
the outbreak of World War I shifted BASF’s interests towards ammonia
production, leading to the abandonment of research in this field [46,47].
These  early  works  were  later  taken  up  by  Fischer  and  Tropsch,  who
conducted in-depth research on CO hydrogenation. The research of both
Fischer and Tropsch came to fruition in 1923 when the Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis  is  considered  to  have  been  born.  That  year  marked  the
beginning of their collaboration, which now lends its name to the pro-
cess. Over the course of three years, they conducted an in-depth study of
the  reaction,  culminating  in  a  work  published  and  patented  in
1925–1926. Their work quickly attracted the attention of various gov-
ernments around the world, leading them to investigate and replicate
the Fischer-Tropsch process. The German government saw an opportu-
nity to secure a supply of liquid fuel and reduce its dependence on pe-
troleum  imports,  which  is  why  their  research  received  substantial
funding.

In  1934,  Ruhrchemie  transferred  the  knowledge  generated  by
Fischer, Tropsch, and their team to the industry with the first fixed-bed
FT reactor in the form of a pilot plant known as the Oberhausen-Holten
pilot  plant.  The  success  of  the  pilot  plant  in  1935  once  again  led  to
increased government funding, and four industrial plants with a com-
bined annual production of approximately 120,000 metric tons of gas-
oline, jet fuel, diesel, and lubricants began operations. All these plants
operated  at  low  pressures  (1–15  atm)  and  moderate  temperatures
◦
(180–200
C) using catalysts made of cobalt, thorium, magnesium, and
silica.  By  the  year  1939,  a  total  of  nine  plants  were  operational  in
Germany.

The end of World War II marked an advancement in the development
of FT-process-related technology [48]. In the United States, the Bureau
of Mines showed significant interest in the process, developing the first
fluidized-bed reactors with iron catalysts (the Hydrocol process) capable
of operating at elevated temperatures (now known as High-Temperature
Fischer-Tropsch,  HTFT).  This  technology  saw  a  quick  transfer  to  the
industry at the Brownsville, Texas plant. However, although this tech-
nology was innovative, Kellogg swiftly improved various issues associ-
ated with the Hydrocol process, developing the circulating fluidized bed

These types of catalysts integrate various reactions on their surfaces,
from  the  activation  of  reactants  to  the  polymerization  of  building
blocks, and even the upgrading of products. This makes them mul-
titask or tandem catalysts.

In this review, we aim to cover the latest scientific advancements in
these fronts making special emphasis in the third point while providing a

reactor  in  1955,  which  Sasol  quickly  implemented  in  its  unique  and
successful  process  known  as  the  “Sasol-Synthol  process”  [48,49].  In
these years, Sasol also commissioned the first of its CTL plants (i.e., Sasol
1,  Sasolburg)  near  the  coal  mines  in  the  region  of  South  Africa.  The
decision to locate it near these mines was a crucial factor in ensuring the
plant’s  continuity  in  the  years  to  come.  However,  despite  these  ad-
vancements during these years, interest in Fischer-Tropsch waned due to
the discovery of new large petroleum deposits in the Ghawar field in
Saudi Arabia and the Burgan field in Kuwait.

In the 1970s, the rising oil prices resulting from the OAPEC oil em-
bargo  and  concerns  about  petroleum  depletion  renewed  interest  in
alternative fuel synthesis. This led FT-based companies to move closer to
coal mines and gas deposits to increase self-sufficiency in coal supply
and take advantage of local importation policies, while also striving to
produce  economically  competitive  products  compared  to  petroleum
derivatives. As a result, many new FT plants were established, and sig-
nificant  improvements  were  made  in  FT  catalysts,  reactors,  and  the
overall  process.  Sasol  was  particularly  notable  during  this  period,
establishing new plants that utilized CTL technology, which was crucial
for  fuel  self-sufficiency  during  the  apartheid  era.  Secunda,  developed
later, emerged as one of the world’s largest CTL complexes and became
central to South Africa’s energy independence strategy. The Sasol 2 (i.e.,
Secunda)  plant  demonstrated  the  scalability  of  the  Fischer-Tropsch
process and its potential for large-scale fuel production, playing a crit-
ical role in global FTS development. However, the process eventually
proved to be not economically competitive enough against petroleum,
leading to the closure of most FT industries [50,51].

In the 1990s, a resurgence of petroleum prices and the discovery of
significant  deposits  of  natural  gas  led  to  increased  attention  to  fuel
production.  Substantial  efforts  were  made  to  develop  industrial  tech-
nology capable of converting economically priced gas into liquid fuels
through the GTL process, which was seen as a competitive alternative to
both  oil  and  coal  [52].  The  first  GTL  plant  using  the  FT  process  was
established in MosselBay, South Africa in 1992, followed by the Shell
FT-GTL plant in Bintulu, Malaysia [53]. Sasol again played a significant
role  in  these  years  with  its  Oryx  GTL  plant  in  Qatar,  which  became
operational in 2007. This plant, a joint venture between Sasol and Qatar
Petroleum, marked a significant milestone in the GTL industry, show-
casing the potential for converting natural gas into liquid fuels on a large
scale. Furthermore, non-conventional gas reserves and, in particular, the
extraction of shale gas by hydraulic fracturing or fracking are leading to
vast  reserves  of  C2–C5  light  alkanes  that  can  either  be  used  together
with  natural  gas  to  produce  energy  in  power  plants  or  can  be  trans-
formed C2–C5 into petrochemical products and/or liquid fuels through
GTL processes [54,55]. This is certainly a valid research topic to attain
more  stable  catalysts  and  optimal  processes  that  allow  for  achieving
higher  yields  per  pass  or  lower  reaction  temperatures.  Nevertheless,
fracking has high local environmental impacts such as water contami-
nation,  induced  seismic  activity  and  noise  pollution,  and  renewable
energy sources, such as biomass, hydrogen, solar, and wind energy, are
emerging as more viable options [56]. In 1997, Choren Industries built
the  first  Biomass-to-Liquids  (BTL)  plant  in  Freiberg,  Germany,  which
sparked extensive research into both BTL and GTL processes [57–59].
The growth of GTL and BTL processes in the 2000s revitalized the
interest  in  the  FT  process.  In  2001,  Velocys  developed  a  new  micro-
channel reactor system, which greatly improved heat transfer compared
to conventional fixed-bed reactors [60,61]. In 2010, they opened a pilot
plant in Austria with competitive results [60]. In 2011, Shell constructed
the  Pearl  plant  in  Qatar,  which  is  the  largest  FT-GTL  plant  to  date.
Currently,  the  microchannel  reactor  technology  is  widely  adopted
among emerging BTL plants, while GTL and CTL technologies are ex-
pected to adopt more sustainable paths with the tightening of legislation
regarding energy management and waste treatment (e.g., CO2) [62,63].
The current state of the environmental policies shows a progressive
upgrade of CTL plants to be more eco-friendly. The eco-transition of CTL
and GTL is ongoing, but there is also an expectation for a further increase

towards  eco-friendlier  industries  such  as  BTL  due  to  concerns  about
carbon  footprints  [53,64,65].  However,  the  key  to  the  future  of  the
process lies in betting on a more decentralized production of fuels and a
more  centralized  processing  within  the  framework  of  circular  bio-
economy. The adoption of massive BTL and WTL processes requires this
decentralization  to make  the processing  of  these  resources  profitable.
That  is  why  reducing  the  dimensions  and  infrastructure  required  to
produce fuels is crucial within this future. This is where microchannel
technology, along with tandem catalysts, can make a turning point being
the  next  milestone  in  FTS  history.  Microchannels  would  allow  the
replacement of conventional reactors of gigantic dimensions with more
manageable  plug-and-play  options.  Tandem  catalysts,  on  the  other
hand, would allow the centralization of subsequent processing reactions,
reducing the required infrastructure. Thus, companies such as RedRock
Biofuels  in  the  United  States  or  AgBioEn  in  Australia  have  found  a
long-term  economic  niche.  In  addition,  recent  international  policies
such as EU HORIZON 2020 are pushing the scenario in that direction,
supporting projects such as Altato, BioTfueL, and Comsyn focused on
this line [66–68]. Furthermore, given the difficulty of electrifying heavy
transport, focusing on the production of this type of fuel (e.g., sustain-
able aviation fuels, SAFs) may also be key in the future.

3. Fueling the future through sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs)

The International Energy Agency’s annual review indicates that the
demand for aviation fuel will increase over the coming decades [69].
The tightening of regulations surrounding aviation fuel necessitates the
transition  towards  more  sustainable  fuels  to  combat  climate  change.
This  process  will  involve  a  shift  to  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuels  (SAFs)
through the use of suitable technology such as the methanol-to-fuels or
the Fisher-Tropsch one [70,71] (see Fig. 3).

The  production  and  demand  for  aviation  fuels  derived  from  sus-
tainable  sources  is  expanding  globally,  with  the  demand  for  biofuels
projected to increase by 41 billion liters between 2021 and 2026 as re-
flected in Fig. 4A [69]. The growth of the SAFs market is driven pri-
marily by government policies, but factors such as overall transport fuel
demand, costs, and specific policies also play a crucial role. Europe and
the United States are currently the largest consumers of SAFs. In Europe,
the revised policy framework (RED II) is pushing the use of SAFs, while
the declining role of petroleum in the United States has made SAFs an
attractive investment opportunity. Although SAFs have not yet received
significant attention in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, the country has set a
goal  to  peak  CO2  emissions  before  2030  and  is  expected  to  promote
alternatives such as SAFs to achieve significant emissions reductions (see
Fig. 5).

The conversion of low-cost resources into economically viable SAFs
presents several challenges, the most significant of which is matching
the  energy  density  of  conventional  aviation  fuels.  The  energy  con-
sumption of an aircraft is linked to its mass, making fuel energy density
and the weight of the airplane critical factors. The function of fuel is to
provide energy to power the aircraft, with the turbine engine converting
the stored chemical energy in the fuel into mechanical energy for flight.
Energy is released through the breakdown of C–C and C–H bonds, with
oxygenates  not  providing  additional  energy  in  aviation  fuels.  When
seeking alternatives to fossil jet fuel, it is desirable to minimize both the
mass and volume of fuel on the plane while maximizing heat of com-
bustion. Fig. 4B compares the potential alternative fuels by comparing
the mass of fuel required to provide 100 MJ of energy with the volume
required  to  provide  the  same  amount  of  energy.  Lower  values  are
preferred on both axes as the same amount of energy can be released
using a lower volume or mass of fuel. Hydrogen has the highest gravi-
metric energy content, releasing substantial amounts of energy per ki-
logram, but its volume, even when liquified, is the highest. Bio-alcohols
such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol have low gravimetric
energy content due to their oxygen content. Biodiesel derived from fatty
acids has good gravimetric energy content, but its low freezing point is a

regional utilization of jet, and [3] the continuous growing demand for
biofuels in  the aviation industry, specifically biokerosene and  bio jet.
The  latter,  with  its  substantial  environmental  benefits,  is  expected  to
experience a growth at a CAGR of around 20 % by 2028 [72]. However,
the central question remains: are sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) ready
for  implementation?  The  answer,  at  present,  is  negative.  The  current
SAF production capacity is insufficient to support a scenario where the
aviation industry is entirely based on biofuels.

A report published by the International Renewable Energy Agency
indicates  that  even  if  all  current  biofuel  production  capacity  were
directed towards bio jet production for aviation, the total supply would
still not meet 1.5 % of current demand [73]. This estimation is based
solely  on  commercially  available  Hydro-processed  Esters  and  Fatty
Acids (HEFA) production facilities. However, biofuels for the aviation
industry produced through the Fischer-Tropsch route could significantly
contribute to the future share of biofuels utilized in aviation.

When  talking  about  process  for  SAFs  production,  the  expense  of
feedstocks  stands  out  as  a  significant  cost  factor.  Alongside  feedstock
costs,  other  substantial  expenditures  in  SAFs  production  encompass
hydrogen, enzymes, operational expenses, and annualized capital costs
[74]. Furthermore, certain processes yield beneficial byproducts such as
heat  and  power  from  lignin  in  the  alcohol-to-jet  method,  which
contribute favorably to overall production costs [75]. It is imperative to
pursue SAFs production routes with high yield and energy efficiency to
ensure economic viability. Metrics such as total process yield (measured
in tons of SAFs, Diesel, gasoline, and/or naphtha per ton of feedstock
input) and energy efficiency (the ratio of energy content in final prod-
ucts to energy input from feedstock and other sources like hydrogen and
natural gas) are collected in Table 2 [76,77].

Table 2 reveals that the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids process
boasts both a high yield and energy efficiency, whereas the FT method
exhibits  a  relatively  low  yield  but  produces  fuel  with  a  high  energy
output.  In  contrast,  the  alcohol-to-jet  and  synthesized  iso-paraffinic
processes yield fuel with low to moderate efficiency in both fuel yield
and  energy  efficiency.  In  the  path  towards  a  high  energy  efficiency
product, it seems clear that FT can break the market. On the other hand,

concern as fuel must remain fluid at cruise altitude to be pumped into
the engine. FT synthetic fuels have slightly higher gravimetric energy
content than conventional jet fuel but slightly lower volumetric content,
making them suitable substitutes for leading the sustainable transition.

3.1. Market penetration and economics of biofuels in aviation

The  examination  of  the  market  penetration  and  potential  profit-
ability  of  biofuels  in  aviation  is  of  critical  significance  in  obtaining  a
comprehensive  understanding  of  the  subject.  The  market  value  of
aviation fuel reached nearly USD 190 billion in 2021 and is projected to
surpass USD 325 billion in revenue by 2028, resulting in a compound
annual  growth  rate  (CAGR)  of  8  %  from  2022  to  2028  [72].  This
unparalleled growth can be attributed to several key factors, including
[1]:  the  prevalent  use  of  jet  fuel  in  civil  aviation  [2],  the  increasing

capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) emerge as
pivotal economic factors in establishing a SAF production facility. Pav-
lenko et al. conducted a comparative analysis of CAPEX across various
production  routes  with  different  biomass  but  with  identical  SAF  pro-
duction capacities [78]. Table 3 collects a summary of the results from
their study.

Illustrated in Table 3, for the same SAF production capacity, CAPEX
rankings  were  as  follows:  Hydrotreated  esters  and  fatty  acids  < Syn-
thesized iso-paraffinic < Alcohol-to-jet < FT. The breakdown of CAPEX
in different SAF production routes revealed that a significant portion of
expenditure was allocated to bioconversion stages. On the other hand,
the lowest OPEX are found for FT and Synthesized iso-paraffinic pro-
duction  pathways.  Nevertheless,  OPEX  strongly  correlates  with  feed-
stock type, as evidenced in previous works [75,77,79,80]. For instance,
at  a  consistent  SAF  production  capacity  of  60.77  million  gallons  per
year,  employing  agricultural  residues  in  the  Alcohol-to-jet  process
resulted in lower OPEX (117 M$/year) compared to energy crops (131 M
$/year) and corn grain (181 M$/year). Thus, unlike CAPEX, which fa-
cilitates  direct  comparison  of  economic  performance  across  different
SAF production routes, comparing OPEX necessitates consideration of
both feedstock and SAF production routes.

However, FT processes have shorter operating times, offering a po-
tential advantage in terms of flexibility and delivery [81]. This makes
the  FT  route  appealing  for  industrial  exploitation,  with  key  consider-
ations  being  cost  optimization  and  resolving  the  lack  of  policy  in-
centives. The design of an incentive program to economically support
aviation biofuels falls outside of the technical capabilities of the research
community, but efforts towards cost reduction and revenue increase can
be pursued through research focused on FT for biofuel production. In
fact, recent studies have shown that with further optimization, there is a
realistic chance (8–14 %, which could be increased to 50 % with tax and
financial incentives) that FT could match the cost of conventional fuels
[59]. As such, opportunities for tandem catalysis using advanced cata-
lytic systems and intensified processes are crucial for advancing towards
market viable SAFs.

In  the  realm  of  biofuel  production,  several  prior  studies  have
explored the economic viability of utilizing Fischer-Tropsch (FT) tech-
nology. The literature produced thus far exhibits substantial disparities,
with a paucity of comprehensive and rigorous techno-economic evalu-
ations for SAFs. This highlights the need for more focused and dedicated
techno-economic assessments in the realm of biofuels for the aviation
industry. Despite the difficulties encountered in obtaining comparable
data, Table 4 presents an approximation of the minimum jet fuel selling
price from various previous studies, for the purpose of comparison. It
should be noted that these values have been estimated due to the diverse
units employed in the reviewed studies. As demonstrated, a substantial
variance is observed for different plant capacities, which is contingent
upon  the  feedstock  utilized.  In  fact,  the  most  commonly  reported
observation by authors conducting economic evaluations in this field is
the significant impact of feedstock on the final cost of fuel production
[76]. This, along with the substantial capital costs associated with FT
processes, could result in changes of up to 10 % in the minimum jet fuel
selling price [82] (see Table 5).

Prior research has also suggested that the co-production of multiple
products holds potential benefits for the production of bio jet fuel [74,

80].  For  instance,  a  study  evaluated  the  economic  feasibility  of  inte-
grating combined heat and power with FT technology to produce bio-
crude, which could then be refined into bio jet fuel. A recent economic
analysis indicated that under Norwegian conditions, the co-production
of biocrude and heat for district heating results in the lowest fuel cost,
with substantial variations as the ratio of electricity to heat production
increases [86]. Another example involves the utilization of FT technol-
ogy  for  the  simultaneous  production  of  jet  fuel  and  electricity  from
lignite and woody biomass, including carbon dioxide capture and uti-
lization for enhanced oil recovery [87]. The authors concluded that the
plant’s economic performance is closely tied to the biomass input and
that  when  carbon  emissions  are  priced,  biomass-based  plants  are  the
most  economically favorable. At a  carbon dioxide equivalent  price of
120  $/ton  and  a  crude  oil  price  of  0.63  $/L,  the  plant  becomes
economically viable. Other research has indicated that carbon dioxide
penalties  in  the  range  of  84  $  to  94  $/ton  are  necessary  for
biomass-based fuels produced via FT to reach break-even, which is not
far from the current carbon tax within the European Union [88]. For
instance, France imposes a carbon tax of 45 €/ton, while Sweden, with
the  highest  carbon  tax  within  the  EU  countries,  charges  116  €/ton,
making FT technology an appealing option for biofuel production in the
near future [89].

Different  studies  have  been  undertaken  to  assess  the  economic
viability of producing sustainable and renewable kerosene, which can
also be used as biofuel for the aviation industry. Dietrich and co-workers
evaluated three potential production routes, namely Biomass-to-Liquid,
Power-and-Biomass-to-Liquid,  and  Power-to-Liquid,  and  found  that
Biomass-to-Liquid had the highest investment cost at present. For the
most  promising  technology  from  a  sustainability  perspective,  Power-
and-Biomass-to-Liquid, the authors determined that the net production
costs  were  approximately  3  €/kg  (or  equivalent  to  2.16  $/L)  [90].
Another study found a minimum selling price of 2.32 $/L for this type of
product, which was the most expensive one in comparison with zeolite
cracking and hydro-processing [85]. An additional study regarding the
production of e-kerosene estimated the average e-kerosene production
costs in the United States and the European Union for the years 2030 and
2050  [91].  The  results  indicated  that  in  2030,  e-kerosene  production
costs could be approximately 1.43 $/L and 2.04 $/L for the United States
and  the  European  Union,  respectively,  and  could  reach  0.99  $/L  and
1.54  $/L  by  2050  for  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union,
respectively. These costs have been similarly predicted in other reports,
with a focus on e-fuel costs in general [92].

To  further  investigate  the  potential  economic  benefits  of  FT  via
tandem catalysis, it is noteworthy that, to the best of our knowledge,
only  one  study  has  been  conducted  on  the  economic  comparison  be-
tween  the  production  of  liquid  fuels  using  traditional  and  tandem
catalysis  methods  for  FT  [93].  The  study’s  results  showed  that  the
product obtained was not pure jet fuel, which is the most sought-after
product for SAFs in these conditions, but rather a mixture of gasoline
(C5–C10),  jet  fuel  (C8–C16),  and  Diesel  (C11–C22).  As  such,  the

conclusions drawn from the study may be subject to change if the target
product is SAFs, but they can still provide valuable insights into the main
economic challenges that need to be addressed. In general, the authors
of the study concluded that there were no economic advantages at the
current  green  hydrogen  prices.  However,  the  detailed  analysis  con-
ducted  revealed  several  specific  conclusions  that  can  be  helpful  in
technical optimizations. For instance, the study found that the equip-
ment costs for FT tandem catalysis were slightly lower than those for
traditional FT (approx. 9 %). This was due to a lower requirement for
compressors and heat exchangers. However, the total capital investment
per unit of final product was greater for tandem catalysis because the
process’s productivity was lower. This is a crucial finding as it suggests
that advanced catalysis could be used to improve the productivity of the
tandem catalysis process and thus reduce its overall costs. The study also
found that the annual production costs for the tandem catalysis route
were slightly lower than those for traditional FT (91.82 $M vs 95.41 $M
in  the  study’s  case).  These  annualized  operating  costs  showed  that
hydrogen  production  accounted  for  approximately  70  %  of  the  total
costs. This highlights the need for technical optimization of hydrogen
consumption  in  the  tandem  catalysis  process  to  significantly  reduce
overall costs and make its selling prices more competitive.

In conclusion, the current market analysis suggests SAFs are still not
economically  viable.  However,  with  the  pressing  need  to  address  the
issue of climate change and reduce CO2 emissions, there is a possibility
for improvement in the medium term. The advancement of FT-processes
through the integration of new technologies, such as tandem catalysis,
has the potential to decrease the cost of the overall process and facilitate
the growth of SAFs and high energy density biofuels. This development
should  be  supported  by  a  strong  policy  framework,  including  stricter
carbon  taxes,  to  drive  the  transition  towards  a  more  sustainable  and
green  transportation sector, powered exclusively by  sustainable fuels.
Additionally,  as  the  demand  for  renewable  fuels  and  chemicals  in-
creases,  there  is  a  need for  scalable  production  processes  that can  be
implemented at commercial scale.

Beyond the catalyst’s formulation, the reactor design also plays a key
role  to  ensure  high  performances.  FTS  and  hydrocracking  (HC)  tech-
nologies typically rely on standalone reactors with large volumes which

are limited to stationary applications within the oil and gas sector. The
lab-scale  integration  of  FTS  and  hydrocracking  in  a  single  micro-
structured reactor with integrated catalyst represents a step ahead to-
wards process simplification and intensification with evident impact in
biofuel  processing  technologies.  This  opens  new  horizons  in  reaction
engineering and reactor design to selectively control the FTS reaction
path  by  exploring  microchannel  reactors  as  a  disruptive  innovative
technology for integrated FTS and hydrocracking. Together with a new
family of advanced multifunctional catalysts, overcoming the limits of
the conventional ASF distribution higher conversion to target interme-
diate chain length hydrocarbons for liquid fuels (e.g., C10–C20), can be
achieved  (see  section  4.2).  Thus,  implementing  both  reactions  in
microchannel systems  will improve  heat and  mass transfer  properties
and  will  facilitate  optimum  catalyst  conditions  perhaps  leading  to  a
revolutionary strategy for direct FTS of liquid fuels from bio-syngas.

The versatility of the microchannel reactor technology and its simple
scalability due to their modular nature maximize the flexibility of our
conceptual approach to deliver heavy transport biofuels (HTB). Such a
flexible  approach  rules  out  the  limitations  of  rigid  fixed  bed  reactor
designs  which  are  heavy,  bulky  and  non-optimal  in  the  biomass  pro-
cessing scenario where in situ processing to avoid transportation cost is
essential.  Beyond  the  technical  advantages  of  microchannel  reactors,
their simplified scalability makes them ideal for distributed productions
and essential for delocalized and seasonal applications as for example
residues  in  farming  and  rural  scenarios  where  biomass  availability
fluctuates.

In this sense, this concept takes a forward-thinking vision by offering
a novel route in which biomass/bio-residues are processed in situ at the
source  production  point.  In  other  words,  this  pursues  in  situ  energy
intensification of the bio-feedstock to produce HTB avoiding extra CO2
emissions  ascribed  to  biomass/bio  residues  transport  to  biorefineries.
The latter is crucial to ensure techno-economic viability of biofuels for
heavy transport such as SAFs. Indeed, our market analysis indicates that
these green fuels are not always economically appealing in the current
scenario and progress in FTS technologies are deemed urgent to push
forward  SAFs  commercialization  at  large  scale  to  decarbonize  the
aviation sector.

4. From biosyngas to biofuels through tandem catalysis

Utilizing a bottom-up strategy for synthetic fuel production requires
employing suitable starting molecules whose chemical nature provides
the  necessary  reactivity  to  produce  fuel  through  chemical  processes.
Obtaining these reactive molecules (historically CO and H2, and recently
added CO2) requires a constant, reliable, and vast supply of raw mate-
rials. Natural gas and coal have played this role in the historical supply
of these materials due to their abundance and well-known chemistry.
However,  since  their  reserves  are  finite,  exploring  other  alternatives
such as biomass becomes more attractive.

Biomass is a promising replacement for coal and gas. This resource
consists mainly of complex organic matter. Due to its relatively short life
cycle  (compared  to  gas  and  coal),  biomass  can provide  the  necessary
reactants through appropriate processing. The processing is dependent
on  its  composition,  but  in  general,  it  is  necessary  to  break  down  the
polymeric  chains  that  make  it  up  using  both  chemical  methods  (e.g.,
gasification,  pyrolysis)  and  biological  methods  (e.g.,  digestion)  [94].
After treatment, bio syngas is obtained (a major mixture of CO, CO2, and
H2). The quality of this bio syngas has a significant impact on the pro-
duction of the final fuel (see section 4.2), and it is often necessary to
adjust the amount of H2 prior to its use in FTS to ensure the quality of the
final fuel.

It  is  common  practice  to  assume  that  biosyngas  undergoes  a  pre-
conditioning step aimed at enriching the biosyngas in H2  or reducing
the amount of H2 required for processing [95]. This is because streams
derived from biofeedstocks typically contain low levels of H2. Conven-
tional strategies include either reducing the carbon content in biosyngas
or enriching H2 via an external supply [96]. In practice, reducing the
carbon  content  is  not  often  used  because  the  goal  is  to  maximize
resource utilization. The most common approach involves introducing
additional  H2  to  balance  the  H2:CO2  ratio  to  a  suitable  level,  which
makes incorporating electrolyzers into these plants for in situ H2  pro-
duction an attractive option.

Regardless  of  the  approach,  additional  facilities  are  generally
required for this pre-conditioning step, such as reactors that perform the
Reverse  Water  Gas  Shift  (i.e.,  RWGS)  reaction.  However,  adding  an
additional  reactor to  conduct RWGS increases production costs, espe-
cially if could be avoided. Therefore, we believe minimizing biosyngas
conditioning steps to improve the process’s atom economy (see section
3) is a key point to enhance its overall competitiveness. As a result, we
differentiate between three routes for hydrocarbon production through
FTS. The traditional route, which utilizes pure syngas (CO/H2) (Eq. (1)),
the mixed route, employing variable bio syngas (CO2/CO/H2) (Eq. (1)
and Eq. (2)), and the most ambitious route, directly utilizing CO2 and H2
(Eq. (2)).

ΔH0 = (cid:0) 128 kJ mol

(cid:0) 1

Eq.1

Eq.2

Of the three possible routes, the last two are the most interesting due
to the chemical and technical challenges they entail. Adding CO2  as a
reactive molecule introduces an additional reaction to work with (i.e.,
RWGS) and presents a handicap for the catalyst. The catalyst must not
only conduct the production of hydrocarbons through FTS but also must
perform a previous stage of transforming CO2 into CO. Furthermore, in
line  with  intensifying  processes,  the  subsequent  upgrading  treatment
should also be performed in the catalyst to align with current energy
interests.

Tandem catalysis is a subcategory of one-pot reactions which com-
bines  multiple  reactions  within  a  single  reactor  [97].  The  concept  of
one-pot  synthesis  is  addressed  to  integrate  appropriate  synthetic  and
catalytic  steps  into  a  unified  process,  thereby  transforming  a  reagent
into  a  final  product.  Tandem  catalysis  of  readily  available  substrates,

such as carbon dioxide, into valuable products represents an effective
approach to  reducing the  cost and  environmental impact  of  chemical
processes by eliminating the need for time-and money-consuming sep-
aration and purification processes [98].

However, the design of selective tandem catalytic reactions repre-
sents  a  great  challenge  due  to  the  requirement  for  different  types  of
catalytic sites and the need to strictly follow a predetermined reaction
sequence. In the synthetic fuel industry, tandem catalysts can centralize
hydrogenation,  polymerization,  and  upgrading  processes,  which  are
typically conducted in separate facilities under specific operating con-
ditions.  When  designing  a  new  tandem  catalyst  for  fuel  production,
several factors like the desired fuel, the suitable Fischer-Tropsch active
phase (e.g., iron, cobalt, ruthenium, rhodium, or nickel), the upgrading
phase  (e.g.,  zeolites,  structured  supports,  metal-organic  frameworks,
metal oxides), the use of promoters, the agreement between operating
conditions, the design approach (e.g., multi-bed, mixed bed, pellet, or
core-shell), and the catalyst cost must be taken into consideration.

4.1. Understanding the tandem catalyst: economic aspects

governing

Tandem  catalysis  is  aligned  with  two  attractive  and  current  eco-
nomic concepts that fit well within the emerging bioeconomy landscape.
The first is ’atom economy,’ a term coined by Trost in the 1990s, which
emphasizes the need for new synthetic methods to incorporate all ma-
terials used in the process to create the final product  by utilizing the
cleanest reaction conditions, thus avoiding byproducts and producing
the target molecule [99]. Therefore, the goal is to produce the target
molecule with maximum efficiency and minimum waste, hence maxi-
mizing the ’atom economy’ of the reaction. This approach is crucial in
sustainable chemistry, reducing the environmental impact of chemical
synthesis. The atom economy in a Fischer-Tropsch process is evaluated
through the selectivity achieved in the overall process. In other words, it
measures  how  many  of  the  reactive  molecules  end  up  forming  the
desired product (i.e., fuels) [100]. However, improving the atom econ-
omy of a Fischer-Tropsch process is complicated due to the statistical
limitations
the
Anderson-Schulz-Flory  (ASF)  distribution,  see  section  4.2).  The  only
way to enhance the atom economy of the Fischer-Tropsch process is by
selectively diverting this statistical limitation (breaking the ASF distri-
bution),  being  tandem  catalysis  an  attractive  solution.  The  second
concept is ’step economy,’ introduced by Wender in the 2000s, which
focuses on minimizing the number of reaction steps to produce the target
molecule, thus reducing the cost, development time, effort, separation,
environmental  impact,  and  execution  time  [101].  By  minimizing  the
number of steps, the overall efficiency and sustainability of the chemical
synthesis process are improved, utilizing less resources and materials,
with  fewer  by-products.  However,  improving  the  step  economy  of  a
traditionally multi-stage process is challenging. As shown, transitioning
to reactive streams with CO2 loading adds an initial step of conversion to
CO, and from a holistic process perspective, subsequent refining steps (e.
g., cracking, oligomerization, and isomerization) are often required to
obtain suitable fuel. This, once again, underscores that intensifying these
stages into a single tandem catalysis step has the potential to enhance
the step economy of the process.

Recently,  the  economic  feasibility  of  a  conventional  multi-reactor
plant  was  compared  to  a  one-pot  plant  using  CO2  and  green  H2  as
starting molecules [93]. On the one hand, the one-pot process showed a
reduced  wax  content  while  an  increased  iso-paraffin/n-paraffin  ratio
(1.4  compared  to  0.3),  thereby  improving  the  octane  number  of  the
produced fuels. Furthermore,  the  cost of  equipment was  lower  in the
one-pot (18.3 $M compared to 20.1 $M) process as fewer facilities were
required (e.g., membranes, compressors, and heat exchangers). On the
other hand, the one-pot process often exhibited lower productivity and
higher hydrogen consumption. These two points were pointed out as the
bottleneck of the process. However, it is expected that the cost of green
hydrogen will decrease in the coming years, which could tilt the balance

towards  the  one-pot  process.  Furthermore,  an  improvement  in  the
selectivity of the products through a new generation of nanoengineered
tandem  catalysts  could  position  the  one-pot  process  above  the
multi-stage approach [102].

For  the  design  of  these  catalysts,  it  is  crucial  to  consider  which
element will be the cornerstone of the catalyst. In this context, the cost of
this element often becomes a limiting factor when designing such cat-
alysts. An appealing composition involves using a combination of metals
suitable for hydrogenating CO2 into hydrocarbons (e.g., Ru, Rh, Ni, Co,
or Fe) and incorporating elements capable of upgrading the produced
hydrocarbons  (e.g.,  zeolites  or  metal  organic  frameworks).  Presently,
FTS  catalysts  mostly  employ  iron  and  cobalt.  While  ruthenium  and
rhodium are active metals in the reaction, their limited availability, high
cost  [103],  and  restricted  applicability  make  them  more  suitable  as
model  catalysts  for  laboratory-scale  studies  rather  than  for  industrial
applications  [104,105].  Nickel,  on  the  other  hand,  is  much  cheaper
[103]  than  ruthenium  and  rhodium  but  tends  to  over-hydrogenate,
making  it  ideal  for  producing  short-chain  saturated  hydrocarbons  (e.
g., methane) but less effective in building complex hydrocarbon chains.
As a result, its use in FTS is typically limited to a promoting role. Cobalt
and iron, with their ability to construct complex hydrocarbons, along
with  their  reasonable  cost  [103]  and  wide  availability,  form  the
cornerstone  of  FTS  catalysts,  rendering  them  crucial  for  the  process
[106]. Co-based metal oxides with lower water gas shift (WGS) activity
have been investigated by integrating with zeolite for syngas to hydro-
carbons  technology  in  which  significant  cobalt-zeolite  interaction
contributed efficiently to enhance the catalyst behaviour towards C6+
selectivity. However, when the cobalt-based metal oxides are integrated
◦
with HZSM-5 molecular sieves and operated at >300
C temperature, a
larger part of CH4 is produced as an undesired product [107,108]. In this
situation,  the  enhanced  hydrogenation  activity  at  High-Temperature
Fischer  Tropsch  (HTFT)  could  not  be  appropriate  to  integrate  with
HZSM-5 for SAFs process. Therefore, the higher cracking temperature of
HZSM-5 at 400
C and a different activity temperature of metal oxides
needs  the  efficient  exploration  of  the  optimal  process  parameters  to
solve  the  problem  of  temperature  mismatch.  Alternatively,  Fe-based
catalysts  have  been  much  explored  in  tandem  catalysis  for  their
abundancy,  thermal  stability,  lower  cost,  and  elevated  temperature
operation that favours the production of olefins with very lower selec-
tivity to paraffins. Since, among the two, iron-based catalysts offer better
performances in RWGS than cobalt-based ones, and coupled with their
lower  cost,  they  emerge  as  the  top  candidate  for  designing  tandem
catalysts,  solidifying  their  dominant  role  in  the  emerging  sustainable
and circular fuel scenario.

◦

Regarding  the  upgrading  of  the  products,  zeolites  have  a  fruitful
industrial  history  due  to  their  cost-effectiveness,  performance,  and
design. Zeolites are extensively used catalysts for hydrocarbon modifi-
cation due to their acidic properties (e.g., a combination of Brønsted and
Lewis centres) and high specific surface area (>100 m2/g). Additionally,
they can operate under pressure without collapsing and in humid en-
vironments. On the other hand, other porous materials such as MOFs
exhibit  interesting  characteristics  such  as  easy  tunability  of  acid  sites
strength and the richness of the organic structure in MOFs may tune the
properties  that  may  pose  this  material  appealing  for  the  tandem
formulation [109]. Their high versatility in terms of structural design
allows  for  the  fabrication  of  MOFs  with  a  very  selective  reticular
chemistry towards a specific product. These features make their imple-
mentation in the tandem catalyst formulations of interest, if issues of
thermal  stability,  pressure,  humidity,  and  cost  can  be  overcome.  An
interesting  approach  to  these  materials  is  their  coordinated  use  with
zeolites,  seeking  to  reinforce  the  over  cracking  problems  common  in
zeolites, using the light products produced as reactants for oligomeri-
zation [110]. However, it is typically emphasized that the use of MOFs in
these  types  of  processes  is  still  very  immature  and  considerable  ad-
vancements must be made for their progressive application.

4.2. Understanding the tandem catalyst: Biosyngas evolution on the
surface

The conversion of biosyngas on the surface of the tandem catalyst is a
complex  process.  However,  the  mechanism  of  forming  the  target  hy-
drocarbon can be divided into at least three reaction stages and three
transport stages. Fig. 6 illustrates the main reaction stages and provides
an  overview  of the  entire process.  Briefly,  the  process starts  with the
activation of the reactants (i.e., CO2, CO, and H2) on the iron surface. The
ease with which these reactive molecules are activated depends on the
nature of the metals involved, the characteristics of the reactants, and
the surface crystallography. The activation of CO2 is particularly chal-
lenging  because  the  strong  C–O  bonds  need  to  be  broken  in  favor  of
forming new C–H bonds. After the reactants are activated, the RWGS
converts CO2 into CO. The CO produced or present in the biosyngas then
undergoes polymerization to produce a distribution of hydrocarbons (i.
e., syncrude). At this stage, the hydrocarbons migrate to the upgrading
centres, typically facilitated by zeolites. The migration of syncrude from
the  iron  surface  to  the  zeolite  is  a  key  step  because  excessively  long
hydrocarbons  can  compromise  system  integrity  due  to  their  high  vis-
cosity and low mobility. Thus, designing an appropriate catalyst archi-
tecture  is  crucial  to  ensure  efficient  transport  [111].  Once  in  the
upgrading  centres,  the  hydrocarbons  undergo  cracking,  oligomeriza-
tion, and isomerization reactions to yield the target product. Alongside
this main pathway, side reactions occur (e.g., methanation, coke depo-
sition,  the  Boudouard  reaction),  and  the  reactants  must  undergo  an
entropically unfavorable phase change (i.e., from gas to liquid), making
the reaction mechanism highly complex.

A detailed view of the mechanism begins with the activation of the
reactants on the surface. The activation of H2 on metal surfaces usually
means the dissociation of H2  into atomic H* species, which are highly
active for hydrogenation reactions. From the electron viewpoint, the H2
bonding (1σ) and antibonding (1σ*) orbitals shift and broaden as they
approach the iron surface, then the electron transfer from the metal to
the H2  occurs [112]. As it drops, the Fermi energy electrons begin to
populate the orbital, eventually weakening and breaking the H2  bond,
while the metal-H bonds become stronger [113]. However, not all the
exposed faces of the catalyst can conduct this activation process due to a
lack  of  orbital  overlap.  This  results  in  a  lower  content  of  H2  on  the
surface and, consequently, to the hydrocarbon growth. The abundance
of H* on the surface can be adjusted by using promoters that boost the
activation process (e.g., Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni) or those that hinder it (e.g., Na,
K) [114,115].

The  activation  of  CO2  or  CO  on  the  catalyst  surface  occurs  in  the
same way as H2. The occupation of the anti-bonding orbitals of these
molecules is necessary to weaken the bonds [116]. Wang and co-workers
have found that the d-band of transition metals plays a significant role in
the CO2  adsorption process. The interaction between the d orbitals of
iron atoms and the antibonding orbitals in CO2 leads to the formation of
δ(cid:0)
species, which eventually decomposes into CO with the
anionic CO2
assistance of H* species [117]. The better the interaction between the
antibonding orbitals in CO2 (2π*) with d orbitals from iron, the higher
the antibonding behaviour in the CO2 bonds, leading to a more efficient
activation. However, the significant amount of chemical energy stored
in  the  bonds  of  these  molecules  can  make  their  cleavage  into  atomic
species  not  the  most  energetically  viable  option,  leading  to  different
mechanistic pathways that explain how these molecules evolve on the
catalyst surface. Therefore, two different pathways are usually distin-
guished for CO2 activation. The first is through a redox mechanism [118,
119]. In this mechanism, the reduced iron on the surface (e.g., Fe2+
) is
oxidized by CO2, resulting in an oxidized iron species (e.g., Fe3+
) and CO
adsorbed on the surface. This mechanism is particularly viable in iron
catalysts promoted with metals that assist in its redox regeneration (e.g.,
Cr,  Cu).  The  second  route  is  an  associative  mechanism  in  which  the
adsorbed  reactants  on  the  surface  help  in  the  activation  of  CO2.  This
happens  through  the  formation  of  reaction  intermediates  (e.g.,

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10115910

carbonates, formates, carbonyl, and carboxyl) that progressively reduce
the high energy associated with C–O bonds [120,121]. This mechanism
is often viable in iron catalysts promoted with alkali metals or metals
with  limited  redox  chemistry  (e.g.,  Na,  K,  Al)  [122].  In  the  complex
surface  of the  tandem  catalyst during  the  reaction, distinguishing  be-
tween  one  mechanism  and  the  other  is  challenging.  However,  it  is
reasonable to think that both mechanisms can occur simultaneously due
to the well-known dynamic nature of the surface in the FTS reaction.
Due to the need to reduce and oxidize iron during the redox mechanism,
this pathway may be restricted to highly dynamic regions around the
redox promoters. In other areas where iron is isolated or with other types
of promoters, the associative mechanism may have a greater influence,
even allowing for the progressive evolution of iron oxide towards active
carbides in FTS. Excellent studies discussing the different CO2 activation
mechanisms can be found elsewhere [123–126].

The activation of CO can occur through two mechanisms. The first is
a dissociative pathway known as the ’carbide mechanism’ [127]. This
involves the adsorption of CO on the catalyst surface and its complete
dissociation  into  adsorbed  atomic  species  that  eventually  react  with
other  species  on  the  surface,  leading  to  chain  growth.  The  other
pathway, known as the ’oxygenate mechanism,’ involves assisted pro-
cesses in which the adsorbed CO progressively weakens the C–O bond to
form C–H, C–C, and O–H bonds [128]. Once again, distinguishing be-
tween one pathway and the other on the surface of the tandem catalyst is
very  complicated.  The  presence  of  promoters  on  the  surface  and  the
operating conditions often favor one adsorption route over the other.

On  the  surface,  the  production  of  hydrocarbons  occurs  through  a
polymerization  mechanism  (FTS)  of  adsorbed  species  (e.g.,  CH,  CH2,
CH3) typically on iron carbides [128]. The reactive nature of synthesis
gas  alters  the  surface  of  the  iron  catalyst,  leading  to  a  dynamic

distribution  of  oxides,  carbides,  and  metals  (see  section  4.3).  The
coupling between the CHx monomers is assisted by the iron carbides on
the  surface,  leading  to  a  hydrocarbon  distribution  (Wn)  that  can  be
statistically described by the ASF distribution (Eq. (3)) [129]. The hy-
drocarbon distribution depends on the ratio between the production of
chain  growth  monomers  (CH2  and  CH),  denoted  as  rg,  n,  and  the
termination monomers (CH3), denoted as rt, n. This ratio, defined as the
chain  growth  probability  (αn),  provides  insight  into  the  system’s
growing behaviour (Eq. (4)):

Wn = n(1 (cid:0) α)2 αn(cid:0) 1
)(cid:0) 1
(cid:0)

αn = rg,n

rg,n + rt,n

(Eq. 3)

(Eq.4)

A high α value suggests a dominant growing behaviour, while a low α
value reveals a dominant termination behaviour [130]. Fig. 7 illustrates
that even with the adjustment of the chain growth probability to its most
efficient  value,  a  broad  range  of  products  will  be  obtained.  Light  hy-
drocarbons are selectively produced when α values are between 0 and
0.65, while heavy waxes are produced when α values are between 0.9
and 1. Values between 0.65 and 0.9 do not guarantee tight selectivity
towards the fuel range, but both light hydrocarbons and heavy waxes
will be coproduced in high quantities. This issue renders selective hy-
drocarbon  production  impossible  on  a  conventional  catalyst  (always
limited by the ASF distribution). Where, the carbon number distribution
of the product following the ASF distribution law would roughly result
in the highest selectivity of products limited to C2–C4 58 %, C5–C11 48
%, C8–C16 41 %, and C10–C20 40 % [131]. However, up to this point,
the  tandem  cooperation  of  zeolite  with  the  iron  phase  has  not  been
considered. The inclusion of zeolite alongside the iron phase aims not
only at intensifying a subsequent industrial process but also at breaking

cyclization)  at  the  acidic  sites.  This  enhancement  of  intermediates
conversion with multiple functions can accurately optimize the product
distribution by shifting the equilibrium towards the forward direction
that could also increase the reaction conversion.

The cracking process enables the conversion of the produced waxes

into lighter hydrocarbons within the fuel range.

The ease with which the hydrocarbon cracks in the zeolite depends
on the nature of the wax itself (whether it is aliphatic or olefinic). The
conversion of aliphatic waxes over zeolites is a challenging process due
to their low reactivity, which requires the presence of highly acidic sites
for protonation and the formation of pentacoordinated carbocation in-
termediates  that  undergo  α-scission  to  yield  shorter  hydrocarbons
(Fig. 8). On the other hand, the conversion of olefinic waxes is a more
facile  process,  with  the  double  bond  easily  protonated  to  form a  car-
bocation intermediate that undergoes α-scission to produce shorter hy-
drocarbons (Fig. 8). The nature of the products resulting from cracking is
dependent on two factors: the probability of encountering an acid site
while  entering  the  zeolite,  and  the  length  of  the  carbon  chain  [132].
Research has demonstrated that wider pores in zeolites result in lower
rates of cracking, as the chance of hydrocarbons encountering an acid
site is reduced. Conversely, narrower pores in zeolites lead to a higher
likelihood of encountering an acid site, resulting in higher cracking rates
and  narrower  ranges  of  hydrocarbon  products.  This  relationship  has
been studied in catalytic cracking on HY and HZSM-5 by Shashikant and
co-workers,  and  by  Abbot  and  co-worker,  and  was  confirmed  by
Kyong-Hwan  Lee  in  the  study  of  wax  cracking  on  HY,  HZSM-5,  and
HMOR [133,134].

The oligomerization process allows the combination of short-chain
hydrocarbons to form longer chains. This process involves the forma-
tion  of  a  carbocation  that  enlarges  the  chain  via  the  Whitmore-
carbocation  mechanism.  Briefly,  the  protonation  of  the  alkene

the ASF distribution [129]. This breakthrough is achieved through the
acidic functionality that zeolite provides to the tandem catalyst, allow-
ing for the cracking of excessively long hydrocarbons (waxes) and oli-
gomerizing the excessively small ones (C2–C4). A tandem catalyst is the
combination  of  a  FT  catalyst  and  a  molecular  sieve  catalyst.  In  this
system,  the  generated  intermediates  on  the  FT  phase  could  be  subse-
quently adsorbed on zeolite surface and diffused through its pores upon
the integration of FT catalyst with molecular sieve (zeolite) in a series of
isomerization,  polymerization,  and
several  reactions  (cracking,

Fig. 8. Processes conducted in the tandem catalyst with emphasis on the zeolite. Brønsted sites are acidic sites that are formed by the presence of protons (H
) on the
zeolite framework. These sites are responsible for acid-catalysed reactions such as cracking, isomerization, and alkylation. Lewis sites are electron-deficient being
responsible for the activation of molecules through coordination to the metal cations. Lewis sites are particularly important for catalytic reactions that involve polar
or unsaturated molecules, such as oxidation, hydrogenation, and polymerization.

produces a carbocation which may suffer all the side reactions associ-
ated with such chemistry. Then the carbocation formed is oligomerized
with  another  alkene  attracted  by  the  electron-rich  double  bond,  pro-
ducing another carbocation that is still capable of further alkene addi-
tion  as  well  as  the  side  reactions.  In  the  temperature  range  of
200–300
C, there is a transition from kinetically limited to thermody-
namically  controlled  oligomerization  on  zeolites,  the  temperature  at
which  the  transition  occurs  being  determined  by  the  activity  of  the
catalyst [135]. Among the zeolites which can conduct these reactions,
the ZSM-5 has shown good results towards the production of fuels [136,
137].

◦

The isomerization process may adjust the properties of alkenes and
alkanes,  particularly  in enhancing  the  production  of  branched  hydro-
carbons, which directly impacts the quality [138]. The reaction pathway
for paraffins includes an additional step compared to that of olefins. A
prior dehydrogenation step is required to form a reactive olefin. Once
dehydrogenated,  the  isomerization  reaction  occurs  via  a  protonated
cyclopropane intermediate. The double bond is protonated, and a car-
bocation is formed, which evolves toward a more stable carbocation by
rearrangements in the structure [139]. The pore size of the zeolite plays
an  important  role  in  determining  the  selectivity  of  the  reaction,  with
smaller  pore  openings  resulting  in  higher  selectivity  for  methyl
branched hydrocarbons. On the other hand, larger pore sizes and large
cavities  tend  to  produce  bulky  ethyl  and  propyl  branched  isomers.
Studies have shown that the structural properties of zeolites significantly
impact the isomerization reaction. For instance, Soualah and co-workers
found that larger pores facilitate the diffusion of reactants and provide a
suitable environment for isomerization reactions, based on their study of
different zeolite families (BEA, MWW, and MFI) [140]. Similarly, Cheng
et  al.  found  that  larger  channel  sizes  lead  to  improved  isomerization
reactions [141].

4.3. Understanding the tandem catalyst: iron active sites

The existence of different iron-active species in the tandem process
makes the role of each species in different hydrogenation processes a
topic  of  interest  among  researchers.  General  assumptions  have  been
made  in  this  regard.  It  is  widely  accepted  that  iron  carbides  (e.g.,
χ-Fe5C2, ε-Fe2.2C, ε-Fe2.5C, Fe7C3, θ-Fe3C) are the active phases for FTS
while iron oxides (e.g., Fe3O4, FeO) are the active ones in RWGS. To
obtain activity in both reactions, an equilibrium between oxidized and
carburized phases must be achieved. The iron surface, when in contact
with  such  a  reactive  atmosphere  like  the  biosyngas  one,  is  unable  to
maintain a stable composition, leading to a dynamic evolution of the
catalyst surface. While these assumptions are generally accepted, iron
carbides  also  exhibit  activity  in  RWGS  [142],  whereas  iron  oxides
typically  show activity only  in RWGS.  It is  likely that since  the  poly-
merization process occurs exclusively on the carbide (which is slower
than RWGS), the chemical activity of the carbide is preferential towards
FTS.

The H ̈agg carbide (χ-Fe5C2), ε-carbides (ε-Fe2.2C and ε-Fe2.5C), and
Fe7C3 are considered active phases in FTS. The formation and nature of
each  carbide  is  highly  dependent  on  the  working  temperature.  H ̈agg
◦
carbide (χ-Fe5C2), is preferably formed at high temperatures (>300
C)
while ε-carbides (ε-Fe2.2C and ε-Fe2.5C), are formed at low temperatures
(<300
C).  The  coexistence  of  different  iron  carbides  under  reaction
conditions has usually hindered the identification of active and inactive
phases [143]. In this sense, only a handful of authors have succeeded in
synthesizing single carbide phases to elucidate their activity, and these
have  not  been  fully  studied  even  after  a  hundred  years.  Yang  and
co-workers  successfully produced isolated Haag carbide nanoparticles
through a wet-chemical process, which exhibited excellent CO conver-
sion to hydrocarbons and confirmed the active role of Haag carbide in
FTS [144]. On the other hand, ε-carbides (ε-Fe2.2C and ε-Fe2.5C) are also
considered  active  in  the  FTS.  The  activity  of  ε-carbides  has  been
explored by Xu et al. confirming a dominant role of this species in the

◦

lower  temperature  range  [145].  Wezendonk  and  co-workers  studied
both  carbides  showing  comparable  normalized  activities  but  saw  dif-
ferences  in  selectivity  [146]. The results  revealed  that ε-carbides had
higher hydrogenation ability than the H ̈agg carbide, leading to higher
methane content and  shorter chains. The study of Fe7C3  is  desired to
explain its role in FTS but it has only been isolated and tested by theo-
retical calculations [147,148]. Experimentally, the synthesis of enriched
Fe7C3  phases is complicated as it appears escorted by other active car-
bide phases that hide their role in FTS. Furthermore, it is formed after a
long reaction time at high temperatures and high pressures handicap-
ping its research. Chang and co-workers achieved the synthesis of the
Fe7C3 with others under a rigorous kinetic and thermodynamic control
over  iron-supported  catalysts  [149].  However,  it  seems  that  only
silica-supported catalysts allow the Fe7C3  phase after a long period on
stream. Therefore, the in-depth mechanism of Fe7C3 formation and key
factors  need  to  be  further  studied.  The  role  of  other  carbides  as
cementite  (θ-Fe3C)  is  controversial.  Traditionally  it  was  considered  a
spectator  carbide.  The  cementite  is  dominant  in  deactivated  catalysts
increasing  the  general  belief  that  it  is  inactive  or  a  spectator  carbide
[149,150]. Nevertheless, recent studies have demonstrated its low ac-
tivity but superior stability to other active carbides [151].

An in-depth study conducted by Jie Zhu and co-workers evidenced
the dynamic structure of iron-based catalysts conducting quasi in situ
techniques (Fig. 9A) [152]. The results observed in their study suggest
that the evolution of an iron-based catalyst usually proceeds via three
different  stages:  the  induction  stage,  the  deactivation  stage,  and  the
steady-stage. Each one of these typical stages is depicted in the images
provided by HRTEM and EELS studies shown in Fig. 9A. The first stage is
related  to  an  induction  time  where  catalyst  is  far  away  from  the
steady-stage and amorphous materials are deposited in the reduced-iron
surface. At this point, two driving forces appear and compete. One is
related to carburizing the iron phase and the other to oxidizing it. The
dissociated  carbon  species  react  with  the  surface  of  Fe  to  form  an
amorphous layer of iron carbides during the first 1 h on steam. As the
reactions  get  started,  iron  oxides  are  also  formed.  The  oxygen  can
migrate into the subsurface, while carbon mainly carburizes the surface
layers (Fe to Fe3C then to the Fe5C2) during TOS of 2–3 h. This Fe5C2-rich
surface gives the highest CO2 conversion rate (Fig. 9B), C2+ selectivity,
and  chain  growth  factor.  Once  the  crystalline  Fe3O4  core  is  formed,
excess oxygen will oxidize the surface iron (carbide), leading to deac-
tivation (Fig. 9C and D). Last, the surface oxidation, H2 reduction, and
carburization  reach  a  dynamic  balance,  leading  to  a  stable  Fe3O4@
(Fe5C2+Fe3O4) layered structure and a steady catalytic performance.

4.4. Understanding the tandem catalyst: promoters

Promoters  are  added  to  the  tandem  catalyst  to  enhance  their  per-
formance and modify their selectivity. The selection of a promoter de-
pends on the type of syngas, the reaction conditions, and the  desired
product distribution. Here, we differentiate between promoters that can
enhance the performance of the iron phase and those that can improve
the performance of the zeolite phase. Promoters that can enhance the
performance of  the  iron phase are  divided  into  alkali, structural,  and
electronic promoters.

The use of alkali promoters is attractive in tandem catalyst due to
their ability to increase the charge transfer to the 2π* orbitals, weak-
ening the C–O bonds, and boosting the dissociation rate in their pres-
ence.  Additionally,  the  use  of  alkali  promoters  has  been  reported  to
improve the textural, redox, and base properties of the catalyst [153].
Xiong and co-workers studied the effect of different alkali promoters on
iron-based  catalysts  and  found  that  the  addition  of  these  promoters
reduced methane selectivity while enhancing chain growth [154]. Other
studies have noted that the use of alkali promoters leads to lower H2
dissociation  and  increased  production  of  long-chain  hydrocarbons  or
formation  of  highly  active  iron-carbide  phases  [155–157].  However,
alkali metals can sometimes affect the acidic environment of zeolites, so

their use must be carefully regulated [158,159].

Structural promoters enhance the resistance of the active phase to
thermal sintering and physical attrition in catalysts. These promoters are
not  necessarily  associated  with  improved  catalytic  activity,  but  they
effectively  prevent  the  sintering  of  other  promoters  and  iron  phases
during activation and operating processes. Thermal sintering is a prev-
alent issue in fixed-bed catalysts, while physical attrition is a common
problem  in  slurry  catalysts.  A  common  synthesis  procedure  for  iron
catalysts involves one or more calcination steps, which typically involve
temperatures  higher  than  the  Tamman  temperature,  leading  to  a
reduction of the active surface area. The primary function of structural
promoters, such as SiO2  and Al2O3, is to act as spacers in precipitated
iron-based  catalysts,  preventing  the  crystallites  from  sintering  during
the calcination process. Suo and co-workers conducted a study on the
effect of silica on the chemical and structural properties when running
FTS and found that silica increased the dispersion of Fe species, inhib-
iting aggregation [160]. In the absence of structural promoters, sintering
processes have been detected during reactions under typical conditions.
Jin and Datye compared the microstructures of unsupported iron cata-
lysts  with  and  without  SiO2  and  showed  direct  evidence  of  sintering
when no structural promoter was added [161]. A potential solution to
this  issue  is  the  use  of  core-shell  catalysts.  Zhang  and  colleagues
compared different iron catalysts promoted with silica and found that

the  core-shell  approach  exhibited  the  highest  resistance  to  sintering
[162].

Electronic  promoters,  such  as  copper,  are  used  to  facilitate  the
reduction of iron oxides. The iron catalyst must be reduced and carbu-
rized before the reaction, and the use of chemical promoters helps to
achieve more active phases. Different noble metals, such as ruthenium,
rhodium,  platinum,  gold,  and  silver,  have  also  been  found  to  reduce
induction periods and improve catalytic performance [163]. However,
copper is the preferred chemical promoter due to its low cost, although it
is not as effective as noble metals. Besides reducibility, these chemical
promoters usually provide additional benefits to the catalyst. Hayakawa
and co-workers have suggested that copper promotes the formation of
iron  carbides,  and  Zang  and  co-workers  found  that  catalysts  without
copper showed longer induction periods [164,165].

In zeolites, the use of promoters is focused on modifying the acidic
properties or incorporating additional functionalities into the zeolite (e.
g., hydrogenation). In the quest to maximize hydrocarbon production in
the  gasoline  range,  it  is  necessary  to  introduce  promoters  that  can
mitigate  the  (sometimes  excessive)  acidity of  the  zeolite.  The  modifi-
cation  of  acidic  properties  can  be  achieved  through  post-synthesis
modifications.  The  simplest  approach  here  is  the  incorporation  of
metals into the acidic positions, taking advantage of the zeolite’s ion-
exchange capacity. The exchange with alkali and alkaline earth metals

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10115914

R. Blay-Roger et al.

is often avoided as they are considered zeolite deactivators (see Section
3.6). However, the rational incorporation of these metals into the zeolite
can have beneficial effects because they can reduce overcracking pro-
cesses in the zeolite and assist in dehydrogenation reactions [166]. One
of  the  most  intriguing  options  for  exchange  is  the  incorporation  of
platinum and palladium. These metals have a remarkable ability to ca-
talyse  dehydrogenation  and  hydrogenation  reactions,  making  them  a
very compelling choice for adjusting the olefin/paraffin ratio in the final
product [167,168]. Another interesting strategy is the modification of
the zeolite matrix through the co-incorporation of binders that alter the
accessibility to pores and active centres [169]. Reducing surface acidity
can prevent early pore blockage and over-cracking. The use of iron as a
promoter  in  zeolites  is  also  common,  especially  when  exploiting  the
topological constraints imposed by the zeolite cavities along with iron’s
ability to catalyse C–C coupling. For this reason, its use is frequent in
isomerization  and  oligomerization  processes  [170].  Another  way  to
adjust acidity is by incorporating different metals into lattice positions.
This  strategy  is  often  used  to  reduce  zeolite  acidity  and  increase  the
chain  length  of  products.  Chen  and  colleagues  recently  studied  the
introduction of iron into lattice positions in ZSM-23 [171]. The results
showed  improvements  in  the  production  of  isomerized  hydrocarbons
using  n-dodecane  as  the  study  molecule.  The  introduction  of  other
metals  into  lattice  positions  can  be  intriguing  depending  on  the
composition of the syncrude obtained from the iron phase. Therefore,
the choice and introduction of promoters into the zeolite are typically
determined by the composition obtained in the syncrude.

4.5. Understanding the tandem catalyst: particle size

Particle  size  plays  a  key  role  in  the  tandem  catalyst  as  it  affects
various key factors such as the specific surface area, active site density,
and reaction kinetics. The specific surface area, which is a measure of
the amount of catalytically active sites available per unit volume of the
catalyst, usually increases with a decrease in particle size. This results in
a  higher  active  site  density  and  thus  an  improved  catalytic  activity.
Additionally,  the reaction kinetics are influenced by the  particle size,
with smaller particles typically having faster reaction rates than larger
particles  due  to  their  higher  active  site  density.  This  is  why  smaller
particle size is often preferred over larger ones as it results in a higher
exposed surface area. Xie and co-workers studied the effect of the par-
ticle size of iron when loaded on different Al2O3 supports [172]. Their
research indicated that the porosity of the support directly affected the
formation of iron particles on the catalyst and that nanometric particles
demonstrated improved activity. However, they also found that particles
that  were  too  small  were  not  effective  for  C–C  bond  growth,  which
hindered  hydrocarbon  growth.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the
findings of Zhu and co-workers, who reported that CO2 hydrogenation to
CO occurs on the smallest iron particles (<6 nm) while C–C coupling is
enhanced in larger particles (>6 nm) due to the absence of steric effects
[173]. Liu and co-workers investigated the influence of particle size on
the  coexistence  of  phases  via  in  situ  experiments  by  preparing  Fe3O4
nanoparticles  for  CO2  conversion  to  hydrocarbons  [174].  The  results
showed that the smallest nanoparticles were fully carburized by Fe5C2,
however,  the  best  catalytic  results  were  obtained  from  medium-sized
catalysts  that  combined  Fe5C2  with  Fe3O4.  The  largest  particles
showed a predominant presence of α-Fe phase, resulting in the highest
methane  yield.  These  results  highlight  the  importance  of  finding  an
equilibrium between oxides and carbides for tandem catalysis. In zeo-
lites, catalytic activity typically decreases with an increase in particle
size due to the deterioration of diffusion [175]. This directly affects the
achieved  selectivity  because  increasing  the  residence  time  of  hydro-
carbons  in  the  zeolite  increases  the  likelihood  of  secondary  reactions
[176].  Additionally,  reducing  particle  size  often  leads  to  more  stable
zeolites,  reducing the  formation  of  inactive species  within  the  zeolite
[177]. Ye and co-workers investigated the effect of particle size on the
isomerization reaction of n-pentane [176].

The results indicated that particle size, along with the crystal size of
the zeolite, significantly influences its activity, with higher conversions
achieved at smaller sizes. In the design of a tandem catalyst, it is crucial
to consider that while the nanoscale design of both the iron phase and
the zeolite is appealing due to increased activity in both components, it
may  lead  to  the  formation  of  undesired  products  in  the  reaction.  As
demonstrated by Zhu and co-workers, the particle size of iron phase can
sometimes  geometrically  restrict  hydrocarbon  formation.  When  com-
bined with a nanometric zeolite, this can lead to excessive cracking of
the syncrude, resulting in higher gas production. Therefore, striking a
balance  between  both  components  and  taking  a  holistic  view  of  the
tandem  catalyst  is  necessary  to  achieve  selective  production  in  the
process.

4.6. Understanding the tandem catalyst: deactivation

The  deactivation  of  the  tandem  catalyst  is  a  critical  factor  when
implementing  it  beyond  the  laboratory  scale.  Here,  we  identify  three
potential sources of deactivation.

◦

1)  Deactivation  of  the  iron  phase.  The  most  plausible  phenomena
that lead to deactivation of the iron part of the catalyst are particle
sintering, carbon deposition, and oxidation/evolution of the active
phase. Sintering occurs when the particle size increases by the coa-
lescence  of  different  smaller  particles  [178].  This  results  in  the
decrease  of  the  specific  surface  area  and  active  sites  [179].  The
evolution happens via changes in the iron phase, re-oxidation pro-
cesses,  or  temperature  effects.  Sintering  is  often  reported  during
activation  processes  as  reduction.  Reduction  processes  are  usually
conducted at high temperatures to obtain a reduced FT-phase. The
evolution of the catalyst phase (e.g., Fe2O3  to Fe3O4) coupled with
the high temperature during activation process is usually responsible
for the sintering. Besides, sintering may also happen during reaction.
Although the reaction temperature is lower than the activation one,
the sintering may happen due to local overheating of the crystallites.
FTS  is  highly  exothermic,  then  the  FT-phase  usually  exceeds  the
Tamman temperature above which atoms on the surface of crystal-
lites are mobile leading to sintering even at low reaction tempera-
tures  (200–300
C)  [180].  An  interesting  solution  to  prevent
deactivation  by  coalescence  is  the  introduction  of  structural  pro-
moters. Quan Lin and colleagues studied the addition of SiO2 to the
formulation of the iron-based catalyst, showing an increase in cata-
lyst  stability  over  extended  reaction  times  [181].  The  presence  of
adsorbed water on the surface due to polymerization reactions also
promotes  particle  sintering. The presence  of water provides  a me-
dium  in  which  the  mobility  of  more  labile  atoms  (i.e.,  at  grain
boundaries) is favored. This stimulates processes of redissolution and
recrystallization, which, along with the high temperature, promotes
particle coalescence [182]. The oxidation of the iron phase is also
common due to the partial pressure oxidant molecules on the sur-
faces such as H2O and CO2. Under a typical tandem catalysis reac-
tion,  both  (liquid)  high  molecular  weight  waxes  and  insoluble
carbonaceous  compounds  are  formed  and  can  drastically  lower
catalyst activity over time. Waxes partially fill the catalyst pore and
retard the rate of diffusion of formed H2O, leading to high partial
pressures close to the carbide phase which could irreversibly oxidize
the catalyst [183]. Zhu and co-workers recently studied the evolu-
tion  of  iron  catalysts  when  hydrogenating  CO2  revealing  that  the
water content plays a key role on the stability of the different iron
species [152]. One solution to mitigate deactivation by oxidation of
the active phase is by incorporating a phase that cracks the waxes
formed on the iron surface (e.g., zeolites). This process reduces vis-
cosity  and  enhances  the  mobility  of  surface  species,  boosting  oxi-
dants desorption. The other common pathway relies on the evolution
of the active carbide species to other carbides with a lower activity as
discussed above [184]. The nature of coking processes during FTS is

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10115915

R. Blay-Roger et al.

also a hot topic. Dry and co-workers relate the deposition of carbo-
naceous species to the electron donating promoters on the surface
catalysts,  as  the  alkali  ones  [185].  The  excessive  addition  of  the
Lewis basic promoters could boost the higher CO dissociation rate
that  may  lead  to  the  permeation  of  inactive  carbonaceous  species
over the active iron phase without being hydrogenated. Therefore,
the optimal use of alkali promoters is usually a key of using CO2 as
co-reactant, where the Boudouard reaction could be thermodynam-
ically avoided, benefiting the overall reaction [186].

2)  Deactivation of the zeolite. The most likely phenomena leading to
zeolite deactivation are coke deposition and poisoning of acid cen-
tres. Carbon deposition is the most common cause of deactivation in
zeolites.  The  formation  of  these  deposits  is  closely  related  to  the
number of acidic centres in the zeolite (Si/Al ratio) and the strength
of these centres. Zeolites offer the opportunity to selectively modify
hydrocarbon production by leveraging their morphology and acidic
properties. However, diffusion within the microporous channels of
zeolites is often slow, and coupled with a large crystal size, this in-
creases  the  residence  time  of  different  hydrocarbons  inside.  This
often leads to over-cracking of hydrocarbons and the generation of
coke deposits [187]. Arun and co-workers using multimodal char-
acterization and modeling techniques revealed the presence of aro-
matic nature of the coke molecules in the spent catalyst [188]. It was
observed  that  the  spent  HZSM-5  catalyst  particles  possessed  the
elemental C, molecular C, and C–H complexes as the fragmentation
products of coke molecules which could destroy its surface (as shown
in Fig. 10). One solution to this problem is the design of nanoscale
zeolites, where a reduction in crystal size leads to shorter residence
times and a lower likelihood of coke deposition. Another strategy is
the  incorporation  of  mesopores  (e.g.,  through  acid  or  base  treat-
ments) that serve as drainage channels for the micropores, improving
hydrocarbon diffusion. Acid site poisoning deactivation is becoming
an increasing concern in new forms of synthetic fuel production. The
use of biomass-derived syngas introduces the possibility of incorpo-
rating sulphur or nitrogen-containing gases into the reactive stream
if the composition of the synthesis gas is not rigorously controlled.
This opens the door to irreversible poisoning of the acidic sites by
these  heteroatoms.  However,  proper  control  of  the  synthesis  gas
composition can bypass this problem or selectively introduce dop-
ants  like  gallium  or  silver,  known  for  mitigating  heteroatom
poisoning [189].

3)  Cross-deactivation.  Cross-deactivation  is  particularly  common
when there is physical contact between both parts (i.e., in core-shell
and mixed bed catalysts). In this process, there is a migration of the
active phase from one part to the other. Typically, alkali promoters
used in the iron phase tend to migrate to the acidic centres of the
zeolite, taking advantage of the moist surface environment and the
ion-exchange  capacity  of  the  zeolite  [158]. This  leads  to  a  drastic
reduction in the zeolite’s activity and an alteration in the quality of
the syncrude produced on the iron [190]. Although this process is
common with alkali promoters, it can occur with any metal. One way

to  prevent  this  type  of  deactivation  is  by  introducing  a  physical
barrier  between  both  parts  (e.g.,  quartz  wool)  in  a  multi-bed
configuration.  Another  potential  solution  that  has  been  studied  is
compartmentalizing the active phases in a micellar core-shell design.
This approach differs from the conventional core-shell approach by
compartmentalizing  the  catalysts,  creating  microenvironments
tailored to each of the reactions that take place [191]. This creates a
physical  barrier  between  the  two  phases  that  can  prevent
cross-deactivation.

4.7. Understanding the tandem catalyst: variables

The performance of a tandem catalyst in fuel production is greatly
influenced by various variables. It is desirable to establish a clear rela-
tionship  between  these  variables  and  the  catalyst  performance.  The
conditions for fuel production must be such that the α value is optimized.
The  temperature  must  be  low  enough  to  enhance  chain  growth  by
reducing desorption rates, while pressure must be high enough to in-
crease CO adsorption. The syngas composition can be adjusted based on
the catalyst used and the desired fuel blend, while the space velocity
should be kept at the highest possible value to produce fuels.

Fig. 11 summarizes the key variables controlled in the laboratory and
their  impact  on  the  tandem  catalyst.  By  comprehending  the  effect  of
these variables, the optimal conditions for the tandem catalyst can be
established.  However,  there  are  more  complex  relationships  between
operating conditions and catalyst activity that are beyond the scope of

Fig.  11. Influence  of  different  variables  with  tandem  catalyst  performance.
Green spots represent a growth in the parameter by increasing the variable. Red

reactions, and re-adsorption processes. Readers interested in these re-
lationships are referred to excellent studies in the field [192–195].

◦

Iron  and  cobalt  metal  oxides  are  the  most  used  conventional  FTS
catalysts, leading to different hydrocarbon chain growth phenomenon at
different reaction conditions, where iron having thermal stability and
high temperature operation would favor the production of lower olefins
fractions  at  suitable  temperature  range  of  300–350
C  (as  discussed
before). Here, FT polymerization reaction being exothermic in nature,
will shift the intermediate products of the FT reaction towards the light
olefins  with  an  increase  in  reaction  temperature  due  to  the  higher
termination  rate  and  increased  desorption  probability  of  the  FT  in-
termediates,  thus  decreasing  the  chain-growth  probability  (α).  Mean-
while, initially increasing the reaction temperature in a specific range
◦
(250–350
C) could evolute different specific structural changes and the
exposure of more active sites, that in turn increase the overall catalytic
path and conversion rates for the enhanced collisions of reactant mol-
ecules with that of exposed catalytic active sites. Similarly, the reaction
temperature has a direct impact on the reaction rate of tandem process,
as the reaction rate typically increases with increasing temperature due
to the enhanced conversion of produced intermediates towards the final
product on the upgrading phase (zeolite). The generated FT synthesis
intermediates  could  be  subsequently  adsorbed  on  zeolite  surface  and
diffused through its pores upon the integration of FT catalyst with mo-
lecular sieve (zeolite) in a series of several reactions (cracking, isomer-
ization,  polymerization,  and  cyclization)  at  the  acidic  sites.  This
enhancement  of  intermediates  conversion  could  shift  the  equilibrium
towards forward direction that consequently increases the CO conver-
sion rate. Therefore, to ensure the effective utilization of FT synthesis
catalysts  in  the  tandem  process,  it  is  crucial  to  meticulously  manage
different catalytic and process parameters, in which temperature has a
key role to match with that of both catalytic phases (i.e., FT phase &
upgrading  phase).  Operating  at  high  temperatures  can  also  lead  to
reduced  product  selectivity  and  increased  production  of  by-products.
This is because high temperatures can lead to unwanted side reactions
and thermal cracking of the synthesized products. At higher tempera-
tures, short and unsaturated chains are produced in higher amounts, as
is methane production [196,197]. On zeolites, higher temperatures also
increase  de-hydrogenation  processes,  which  enhances  cracking  rates.
Isomerization and oligomerization processes show optimal performance
at moderate temperatures [198,199]. In practice, the reaction temper-
◦
ature used in FTS ranges from 220 to 320
C, depending on the catalyst
and  reactor  design.  Lower  temperatures  are  often  preferred  for  high
selectivity  towards  higher  molecular  weight  products,  such  as  waxes,
while  higher temperatures are  favored for improved  reaction  kinetics
and increased production of lower molecular weight products, such as
fuels.

The relationship between pressure and the performance of the tan-
dem  catalyst  is  a  complex  one.  Pressure  plays  an  important  role  in
determining  the  reaction  conditions  and  thus,  the  product  yield.  A
practical way to visualize the effect of pressure is through Le Chˆatelier’s
principle. An increase in pressure forces the shift towards the production
of long-chain hydrocarbons. Generally, increasing the pressure leads to
an increase in the reaction rate and selectivity towards higher molecular
weight products, such as waxes. This is due to the higher concentration
of reactants at higher pressure, which results in increased collision fre-
quency between reactants and increased reaction kinetics. Pressure has
an impact on the ratio of adsorbed species, with CO being more strongly
adsorbed onto the catalyst surface than H2. When delved into, this re-
sults in an increase in the concentration of CO on the catalyst with an
increase  in  pressure.  High  CO  concentrations  promote  chain  growth,
which  increases  the  α  value,  but  also  reduces  the  selectivity  towards
paraffins. Additionally, the incorporation of CO into the chain grows,
leading to an increase in oxygenate production [197,200]. On the other
hand, the effect of pressure on the conversion of cracking over zeolites is
negative, while the effect on oligomerization and isomerization activity

is positive. Farias and co-workers conducted studies on different pres-
sure conditions and found that higher pressures are beneficial to chain
growth [201]. However, they caution that too high a pressure may not
be  beneficial  in  fuel  production,  as  it  can  lead  to  an  increase  in  wax
content. Calemma and co-workers studied the pressure effect on the wax
conversion towards middle distillates and found that a higher pressure
results in a lower conversion [202]. In practice, the pressure used in FTS
can  range  from  10  to  40  bar,  depending  on  the  catalyst  and  reactor
design, being therefore important to find the optimal pressure range that
balances  the  positive  effects  of  increased  pressure  with  the  negative
effects of excessive pressure.

Traditional syngas is a gas mixture of CO and H2 and it is used as the
starting material for FTS. However, the trend towards sustainability has
led to the use of CO2-enriched syngas as feedstock for sustainable fuel
production. Regardless of the syngas composition, a higher H2  content
increases the termination species, which has a negative impact on chain
growth probability (α). Higher hydrogen content also increases methane
production and heat transfer, as hydrogen has a much higher thermal
conductivity than CO and CO2, which reduces soot rates. The ratio of
paraffins to olefins increases with higher hydrogen content, while the
production of oxygenates is negatively impacted by hydrogen as more H
species are present on the catalyst surface [203].

The space velocity influences the contact time between the reactants
and the catalyst surface. Lower contact time increases interaction be-
tween the reactants and the catalyst surface, favouring hydrogenation
and  oligomerization  reactions  to  form  longer  hydrocarbons  [204].
Higher space velocity reduces hydrogenation rates, increasing the pro-
duction of alkenes and oxygenates rather than hydrogenated products
such as paraffins or methane [205]. Cracking, isomerization, and olig-
omerization processes over zeolites also decrease with increasing space
velocity. There is a direct relationship between high contact times and
heavy hydrocarbon production [206].

4.8. Understanding the tandem catalyst: model tandem catalysts

The various points discussed so far converge in the final design of the
tandem catalyst. The nanoengineered design of these catalysts, repre-
sented  in  Fig.  12  A,  is  challenging  due  to  the  multitude  of  factors  to
consider,  but three  distinct  approaches emerge  based  on  the  distance
between the active phases (from nanometric to metric scale): multi-bed,
mixed-bed, and core-shell [207].

The  multi-bed  approach,  where  the  FT-active  phase  is  placed  up-
stream and the upgrading phase is placed downstream, is typically the
first attempt in studying these systems. This approach seeks to integrate
different active phases in the same reactor, allowing for the evaluation
of compatibility between active sites under common operating condi-
tions. The different phases can be physically separated by using mate-
rials such as quartz wool or efficient heat transfer materials such as SiC.
This approach helps prevent catalyst deactivation due to migration of
common promoters (Na, K) from the FT phase to the acid sites in the
zeolite [208]. However, a  few authors have  attempted to shorten the
distance between active phases, either by physically mixing both phases
in  a  mixed-bed  or  by  using  nano-engineering  approaches  such  as
core-shell ones. The goal of this intimacy is to improve mass transfer
between the active phases, leading to improved catalytic performance.
The close interaction between phases, however, requires a higher level
of knowledge and control over  the catalyst due to potential side  pro-
cesses  [207].  The  multi-bed  approach  helps  avoid  such  processes,
including  re-adsorption  of  products,  migration  of  active  phases,  and
reactions  between  phases.  This  may  explain  the  selective  number  of
FT-tandem  studies  focused  on  fuel  production  from  syngas  and  CO2
syngas using iron as the cornerstone.

Noreen  and  co-workers  prepared  a  set  of  sodium-promoted  iron
combined with SAPO-11 and HZSM-5 to produce enriched isoparaffinic
gasoline  from  CO2  [156].  The  research  explored  the  utilization  of
different  packing  systems  in  the  multi-bed  configuration  approach  to

achieve the desired result. The results indicated that the performance of
the  catalysts  varied  depending  on  the  position  of  each  layer  in  the
reactor bed (Fig. 12B). The highest selectivity towards gasoline range
(75 %) was obtained in a dual bed configuration, consisting of a NaFe
phase combined with HZSM-5. However, this combination also resulted

in the highest aromatic content (35 %) among the catalysts tested. The
highest isoparaffinic gasoline yield was obtained through a triple bed
configuration,  with  SAPO-11  and  ZSM-5  placed  sequentially.  The  au-
thors  suggested  that  the  isoparaffins  were  formed  at  the  SAPO-11
mouth, and the aromatization, which occurs in the downstream ZSM-5

porous, was prevented. When the configuration was altered to HZSM-5
followed  by  SAPO-11,  the  aromatic  production  increased  due  to  the
occurrence  of  aromatization  reactions  on  ZSM-5.  The  mixed  bed
approach resulted in the highest C12+ and n-paraffin content, presum-
ably due to mass transfer diffusion between the active sites. From the
perspective of isoparaffin quality, the highest content in all cases was
mono-branched  isoparaffins.  However,  di-  or  even  tri-branched  iso-
paraffins  were  also  formed.  When  the  FT-active  site  was  followed  by
SAPO-11,  the  content  of  di-branched  isoparaffins  greatly  increased.
Similarly,  when  ZSM-5  was  used  in  any  system,  the  tri-branched  iso-
paraffin content increased.

Wei  and  co-workers  conducted  a  comprehensive  study  comparing
the  performance  of  six  commercially  available  zeolites  (HY,  HBEA,
HMOR, HZSM-5, HZSM-23, and HMCM-22) in the production of gaso-
line  (C5–C11)  from  CO2  using  a  mixed  bed  configuration  [209].  The
study aimed to identify the most effective tandem catalyst by switching
the upgrading phase. The results showed that the hydrocarbon distri-
bution was highly dependent on the zeolite employed. The zeolites with
10-member  rings  (HZSM-5,  HZSM-23,  HMCM-22)  displayed  superior
selectivity compared to the other zeolites (Fig. 12C). The NaFe/HZSM-5
tandem catalyst showed the highest selectivity among the 10 MR family
with a selectivity of 78 %, however, it resulted in high aromatic content.
On the other hand, the NaFe/HMCM-22 tandem catalyst displayed lower
selectivity  towards  gasoline  (57  %)  but  had  a  higher  proportion  of
i-paraffins (46 %). The study revealed that the Si/Al ratio is crucial in
obtaining the desired hydrocarbon range while the morphology of the
zeolite influences the distribution of enriched molecule fractions. The
relationship  between  the  zeolite  structure  and  selectivity  has  been
extensively studied by other researchers [210–212]. It has been high-
lighted that the molecular size of the zeolite pores and its topology favor
specific  types  of  molecules.  1D  large  pore  zeolites  like  ZSM-22  and
ZSM-23 produce C5+ paraffins with no aromatic content, while chan-
nels  with  cross-sectional  areas  enhance  the  production  of  aromatics.
Linear  channels  Favor  the  production  of  aromatics  while  sinusoidal
channels  favor  olefin/paraffin  production.  Although  the  zeolite  struc-
ture  determines  the  space  available  for  producing  the  desired  hydro-
carbons, recent studies have shown that zeolites with identical topology
but different acid strength and acid density can lead to different product
distributions [213,214].

The production of paraffins in synthetic fuel synthesis is often limited
by  the  activity  of  the  FT-active  phase.  Although  acid  zeolites  can  be
utilized to produce aromatics or isoparaffins from olefins, the n-paraffin
to  iso-paraffin  ratio  is  challenging  to  adjust  as  most  tandem  catalysts
result in a dominant production of olefins. This can lead to additional
costs for product separation if the resulting gasoline does not meet the
desired composition parameters. A potential solution to streamline the
synthetic fuel production process is to target catalysts that can produce
individual components of the fuel, which can then be blended to meet
the desired fuel specifications.

Wei and co-workers conducted a study comparing different sodium-
promoted iron-zeolite combinations for the production of iso-alkanes in
the gasoline range [215]. The results showed that the highest selectivity
towards iso-paraffins was achieved using beta zeolite, although this was
accompanied  by  high  aromatic  content.  Gascon  and  co-workers
explored the use of a potassium-promoted iron catalyst combined with
platinum-loaded beta zeolite in a dual-bed approach for highly selective
paraffin fuel production from CO2 [155]. The small amount of platinum
in the zeolite shifted the product distribution towards paraffins, which
could result in reduced separation costs. The catalytic performance was
clearly improved when combined with Pt-Beta, as the olefin fraction was
completely  consumed,  leading  to  an  increase  in  gasoline  production
while  decreasing  the  heavy  hydrocarbon  fraction.  Pt-clusters  presum-
ably acted as sites for the hydrogenation to some kinds of paraffin, while
reducing the olefin content. Besides, the long chain hydrocarbons were
successfully hydrocracked and the selectivity towards gasoline increased
while  the  heavy  hydrocarbon  fraction  decreased.  Nevertheless,  the

Pt-Beta  showed  low  oligomerization  activity  as  the  light  alkanes
(C2–C4)  greatly  increased  probably  because  hydrogenation  is  faster
than  oligomerization.  The  best  results  in  the  gasoline  range were  ob-
C, with 25 % selectivity towards gasoline and 30 % CO2
tained at 325
conversion. The dual-bed approach avoided re-adsorption processes in
the FT-phase, resulting in efficient and stable paraffin production.

The distribution of active sites in multi-bed and mixed bed systems of
FTS  catalysts  and  zeolites  is  often  uncontrolled  and  non-ideal.  Direct
loading  of  iron  into  the  zeolite  through  wetness  impregnation  is  an
attractive approach for maximizing the intimacy between active sites.
However, Ching and co-workers have indicated that direct loading may
block access to acid sites, thus decreasing gasoline production [216]. To
address  this  issue,  they  investigated  different  Fe/Y  catalysts  for  the
closest level of intimacy, avoiding the blockage of channels by growing
the zeolite around iron-supported seeds. Their findings showed that the
direct loading of the zeolite negatively impacted the catalyst’s surface
area,  most  likely  due  to  the  aggregation  of  iron  nanoparticles  that
blocked the zeolite pathways. In light of these findings, the core-shell
approach offers the opportunity to control the distance between active
phases  on  a  mesoscopic  scale  [217].  This  approach  allows  for  a
controllable spatial distribution between the active phases, potentially
leading to better results than other approaches. Non-selective deposition
of active phases results in decreased efficiency of zeolite functionality
and  potential  sintering  of  the  active  phase,  reducing  the  activity  and
selectivity towards fuel products [218].

The core-shell approach illustrated in Fig. 12D enables the encap-
sulation of metal particles while providing access to metal active sites
through the porous structure of the zeolite. This system also suppresses
metal particle agglomeration, a common factor in catalyst deactivation.
The  shell  thickness  has  a  crucial  impact  on  selectivity  towards  the
desired  hydrocarbon  range,  which  can  be  easily  controlled.  Thicker
shells tend to lead to lighter hydrocarbon production due to increased
diffusion limitations [219]. Close contact between the FT active phase
and the upgrading active phase minimizes further desorption, enhancing
selectivity  in  an  appropriate  system.  However,  the  synthesis  of  these
catalysts requires nano-engineering techniques, which greatly increases
catalyst production costs, as well as the use of special metal precursors
such as mercaptosilanes, making scale up difficult. Despite these chal-
lenges, significant progress has been made in the production of highly
selective catalysts for fuel production. The scalability of this system will
depend on its lifetime and selectivity being profitable compared to other
approaches.

Wang and co-workers conducted a comparison between the use of an
Fe@NaZSM-5 core-shell catalyst, the multi-bed approach, and the mixed
bed approach [220]. They synthesized the core-shell iron phase within
the  zeolite  network  via  a  simple,  solvent-free  approach.  The  results
indicated  that  the  core-shell  system  demonstrated  higher  selectivity
towards the gasoline range (53 %) compared to the multi-bed approach
(30 %) and the mixed bed system (29 %). However, despite its superior
selectivity, the CO conversion of the Fe@NaZSM-5 was lower compared
to the other approaches, reaching only 30 %. This was attributed to the
long pores of the zeolite that hinder the diffusion of syngas to the iron
carbide phase.

The core-shell approach tends to be a double-edged sword. On one
hand,  the  proximity  between  the  FT-phase  and  the  hydroprocessing
phase  enhances  selectivity.  On  the  other  hand,  carbon  deposition  or
promoter migration may block the microchannels in the zeolite, leading
to  reduced  diffusion  of  syngas  between  the  shell  and  the  core.  One
effective solution to address this bottleneck could be the use of meso-
porous  channels in  the core-shell system. Ding and co-workers devel-
oped a  core-shell system  containing Fe–Mn nanoparticles in the core,
coated by a meso-HZSM-5 (Fig. 12E) [221]. The CO conversion further
increased  up  to  52  %.  Besides,  the  mesopores  boosted  the  activity
avoiding  re-adsorption  processes  that  would  repeat  the  hydrocraking
processes, leading to high yields in the short-chain range (C2–C4). The
use  of  mesopores  is  interesting  for  increasing  the  mobility  of

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10115919

R. Blay-Roger et al.

hydrocarbons  within  the  zeolite  and  reducing  the  likelihood  of  over-
cracking of the chains [222]. This can provide greater stability to the
zeolite  by  decreasing  the  deposition  of  coke  derived  from  cracking
[223].  Additionally,  the  introduction  of  mesopores  allows  access  to
bulky hydrocarbons that are not accessible in micropores, which can be
interesting in the cracking of waxes.

Hollow  core-shell  structures  have  gained  increasing  attention  in
catalysis due to their low density, high surface areas, and tunable shell
thickness  [224].  The  hollow  cores  provide  ample  space  for  syngas
storage  and  active  species  loading,  transforming  the  system  into  a
nanoreactor.  Microporous  and  mesoporous  shells  with  tunable  pore
sizes enhance mass transfer of reactants and products within and outside
the  hollow  system  [225].  Ding  and  co-workers  developed  a  hollow
HZSM-5 iron-based tandem catalyst that showed excellent CO conver-
sion (90 %) and good stability after 180 h [226]. The hollow structure
enhanced  diffusion  of  reactants  and  products  and  provided  constant
syngas  storage,  avoiding  repeated  hydrocracking  processes  in  the
microporous channels by tailoring the thickness. Xiao and co-workers
further  improved  the  hollow  core-shell  system  by  designing  a  double
hollow  core-shell  catalyst  that  maximized  gasoline  production  [227].
This system, consisting of an iron hollow sphere coated with a HZSM-5
thin  shell,  demonstrated  superior  selectivity  (64  %)  compared  to  the
mixed-pellet approach (55 %) and mixed-bed approach (44 %).

4.9. Understanding the tandem catalyst: from the powder to the reactor

Pelletizing the catalyst is a necessary step when scaling up. The use of
pellets  has immense potential in industrialization, especially in fixed-
bed reactor systems. However, the heat and mass transfer limitation of
these systems is usually the bottleneck for commercial utilization. The
FT  reaction  is  highly  exothermic  which  causes  an  adiabatic  rose  in
temperature, leading to the deactivation of the pelletized catalyst [228].
Fixed-bed reactors require large catalyst pellets to ensure proper pres-
sure drop. It is widely accepted that the higher pellet results in a lower
reactor  pressure  drop  due  to  higher  bed  void  fractions.  However,
intrapellet diffusion limitation and heat transfer problems usually lead
to inefficient utilization of the active phase. To overcome these handi-
caps,  different  approaches  may  be  adopted.  Brunner  and  co-workers
studied  different  shapes  (cylinder,  hollow  cylinder,  trilobe,  and
sphere)  and  sizes  for  pellets,  focusing  on  diffusion  and  heat  transfer
phenomena [229]. They found that a trade-off must be achieved from
the size side. The lower pellet size results in a greater pressure drop and a
higher resistance to flow. However, small pellets improve pore diffusion
and heat transfer, thus benefiting the reaction rate. From the shape side,
they  found  that  trilobe  maximizes  the  catalyst  effectiveness  by  mini-
mizing the diffusion resistance. While the adjustment of the pellet ge-
ometry  mainly  focuses  on  shortening  the  diffusion  resistance.  When
looking at tandem catalysts with zeolites, the pore spatial structure is
also  a  practical  approach  to  enhance  mass  transfer  by  increasing  the
effective diffusivity. The hierarchically structured catalyst pellet could
simultaneously meet the need of a high internal surface for active phase
distribution and high mass transfer efficiency. Li and co-workers studied
the potential of large porous when pelletizing the catalyst, showing that
meso  and  macroporous  channels  may  act  as  drains,  enhancing  the
diffusion of the FT products outside the pellet [230].

Thermal conductivity is another of the key points in designing highly
efficient pelletized FTS catalysts, where the non-isothermal on-stream
mode  of  the  pellets  leads  to  a  rapid  deactivation  of  the  catalyst.  To
prevent localized overheating on the surface of the pellets in the cata-
lytic  bed,  specific  process  monitoring  and  temperature  control  re-
quirements  are  essential.  This  will  ensure  efficient  heat  and  mass
transfer and prevent shifting the product distribution towards undesir-
able  lighter  hydrocarbons  (e.g.,  CH4).  Short  distances  (proximity)  be-
tween the different active sites of FT phase and the hydro processing
phase, can be highly beneficial for accelerating the second reaction by a
high  local  concentration  of  the  product  of  the  first  catalyst,  thus

enhancing the selectivity. On the contrary, adverse effects might occur
when a product of the first catalyst inhibits the second or the catalytic
material reacts with each other, causing deactivation. Carbon deposition
or  promoter  migration  may  block  the  microchannels  in  the  zeolite,
leading to reduced diffusion of syngas between the shell and the core. A
balance between these effects will determine the optimal distance be-
tween  the  active  sites,  which  needs  to  be  adjusted  during  catalyst
preparation [231]. While the careful manipulation of various catalytic
parameters is vital for the negligible heat removal from active sites on
which CO and H2 react and low thermal conductivity of the material of
the pellets in conventional catalysts based on oxides [232,233]. Usually,
the  presence  of  a  zeolite  in  optimal  macropore  volume  in  a  proper
orientation (proximity) between both phases (metal/zeolite) results in
the efficient mass transfer on its surface and a high thermal conductivity
of the pellets contributes to their resistance to local overheating. Heat
and mass transfer must be simultaneously intensified in both the catalyst
bed  and  the  individual  catalyst  pellets  to  achieve  high  productivity.
Where,  different  techniques  such  as  compaction  of  an  active
metal-zeolite mixture into pellets; the deposition of a metal exhibiting
activity in FTS on a zeolite; the encapsulation of metal component into a
zeolite; and the physical mixing of an FTS catalyst and a zeolite, have
been conducted in this regard to provide the copresence of sites that are
active in FTS and hydrocarbon conversions in one catalyst system. In an
overall demonstration of the transport of the feed components and the
synthesis products for the rate-limiting stage of the process, the encap-
sulated  catalysts  are  considered  the  least  promising  for  industrial
implementation,  while  the  impregnated  and  composite  (compacted)
catalysts are the most promising candidates. Usually, a possible syner-
gistic effect of heat-conducting component and zeolite additives, could
arise in the mixed catalysts where the active metal is not localized on the
surface  of  the  catalyst  components,  as  it  is  in  the  case  of  solution
deposition. A recent detailed study by Sineva and co-workers demon-
strated  the  impact  of  pelletized  zeolites/cobalt  based  multifunctional
FTS  catalysts,  eventually  dictating  the  synthesis  product  composition
upon the intensification of heat and mass transfer in relationship with
the  effect  of  a  heat-conducting  additive  and  a  zeolite  on  the  FTS  pa-
rameters [234]. It was concluded that the simultaneous introduction of a
heat-conducting  additive  and/or  a  zeolite,  resulting  in  the  lowering
temperature inside the pellets, can eventually decrease the probability
of  local overheating  that can be  generated due  to  the  increase in  the
thermal conductivity coefficient. Since the overall increase in the bulk
density  of  the  liquid  hydrocarbon  mixture  formed  and  their  average
boiling point can be avoided, leading to the facilitation of the removal of
C5+ products from the catalyst surface and thereby contributing to both
mass transfer and heat removal.

4.10. Understanding the tandem catalyst: new reactors

The  design  of  the  reactor  and  the  operational  conditions  play  a
crucial  role  in  determining  the  product  selectivity  of  Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis  (FTS)  processes.  This  highly  exothermic  reaction  requires
precise control of heat transfer, making it one of the most significant
challenges  in  reactor  design.  Typically,  there  are  three  main  types  of
conventional  reactors  used  in  FTS  processes:  Fixed  bed,  slurry,  and
fluidized bed reactors [235].

Fixed bed reactors consist of a packed bed of solid catalyst particles,
and the reactants flow through the bed [235]. This type of reactor offers
good  heat  transfer  characteristics  and  temperature  control,  which  is
essential in the highly exothermic FTS reaction. In addition, fixed bed
reactors  are  relatively  low-maintenance  and  have  a  long  operational
lifespan, making them a popular choice for large-scale FTS processes.
However, fixed bed reactors have a limited reaction rate due to the low
mass transfer between the reactants and catalyst [236].

Fluidized-bed  reactors  present  both  advantages  and  challenges  in
FTS,  requiring  careful  evaluation  for  industrial  use.  These  reactors,
optimized for high-temperature FTS, offer improved heat transfer and

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10115920

R. Blay-Roger et al.

temperature  control,  along  with  enhanced  catalyst  mixing  and  high
production capacity. However, challenges such as scale-up difficulties,
catalyst agglomeration, and product deposition hinder their widespread
adoption [237].

Slurry bed reactors, consist of a suspension of catalyst particles in a
liquid medium [235]. The reactants are introduced into the slurry, and
the reaction takes place on the surface of the catalyst particles. Slurry
bed reactors offer improved mass transfer and reaction rates compared
to fixed bed reactors, and the suspension medium can be used to cool the
reaction, reducing the risk of hot spots and catalyst sintering. However,
slurry bed reactors are more complex to operate and maintain compared
to fixed bed reactors and can also result in product contamination from
the liquid medium. There are numerous variations and innovative ap-
proaches that may become increasingly important in the future [238,
239].

Recently, microchannel reactors have emerged as a promising new
reactor concept for FTS processes. These reactors consist of millimetre-
sized  channels  where  reactions  occur,  leading  to  intensified  chemical
reactions  due  to  fast  heat  removal  and  superior  mass  transfer.  The
enhanced gas distribution in these reactors also inhibits the formation of
side  products,  reducing  the  need  for  downstream  processing  units.
Additionally, the fast heat transfer prevents the formation of hot spots,
which can cause sintering processes [240]. These reactors offer several
advantages  that  make  them  particularly  suitable  for  distributed  pro-
duction  scenarios
involving  FTS  reactions.  Their  high  surface
area-to-volume ratio promotes efficient heat and mass transfer, resulting
in better temperature control and improved selectivity and conversion
rates in FTS reactions. Their small size reduces the inventory of reactive
materials, lowering the risk of accidents, and their compact design en-
ables  better  heat  management,  reducing  the  chance  of  runaway  re-
actions  [241].  Additionally,  these  reactors  can  be  easily  scaled  up  or
down  by  adding  or  removing  modules,  providing  flexible  production
capacity adjustments that align with demand fluctuations [62,242]. This
modularity  makes  them  ideal  for  distributed  production  scenarios.
Microchannel reactors also offer precise control over reaction conditions
like temperature, pressure, and residence time, enabling optimization of
FTS reactions for desired product yields and selectivity, which increases
overall  process  efficiency.  The  enhanced  mass  and  heat  transfer  in
microchannel reactors allows for operation at higher reaction rates and
temperatures,  potentially  increasing  productivity  and  reducing  resi-
dence times. This intensification can lead to smaller reactor footprints
and reduced equipment size, making them suitable for distributed pro-
duction in space-constrained environments. Furthermore, microchannel
reactors  can  be  adapted  to  accommodate  a  variety  of  feedstocks,
including renewable sources like biomass-derived syngas. Their flexible
design  allows  for  efficient  use  of  diverse  feedstocks,  promoting  sus-
tainable and environmentally friendly production processes.

Although  microchannel  reactors  offer  many  advantages,  commer-
cialization faces some obstacles, such as the low ratio between catalyst
and reactor volume, which requires multiple reactors in a plant. Guettel
and Turek compared the commercially established slurry bubble column
and  fixed-bed  reactors  with  the  microchannel  one  [243].  The  results
showed that although the highest productivity per unit of catalyst vol-
ume was achieved on the microchannel reactor, the overall productivity
was  comparable to  the  fixed-bed  technology  due  to  the  low  ratio  be-
tween catalyst and reactor volume. Other challenges like fouling, cata-
lyst stability, and precise manufacturing tolerances must be addressed to
ensure  successful  implementation  in  FTS  applications  [241].  Robust
control  strategies  and  comprehensive  safety  measures  are  crucial  for
managing operational complexities in distributed production. Scaling up
these reactors poses also challenges due to variations in pressure drops,
heat transfer rates, and fluid dynamics that affect reaction kinetics and
selectivity.  Optimizing  channel  geometry  and  flow  distribution  is
necessary  to  maintain  uniform  conditions.  Although  manufacturing
costs are higher due to the precision engineering required, their compact
design  reduces  support  structure  needs  and  minimizes  energy

consumption and waste. Manufacturing advancements, such as additive
manufacturing  and  micro-machining,  are  gradually  lowering  these
costs.  Long-term  operational  savings  and  economies  of  scale  can  also
offset initial investments. Precise flow control, heat management, and
catalyst loading are critical to achieving desired reaction kinetics and
selectivity. Real-time monitoring and control systems are essential for
managing  these  complexities.  Automation,  sensing  technologies,  and
computational  modeling  have  improved  the  control  and  efficiency  of
microchannel reactors, addressing many of these challenges. However,
the advancements in 3D printing technology have simplified the fabri-
cation of microchannel reactors, making it easier to construct complex
structures [244].

Microchannel reactors are ideal for addressing the challenges posed
by  both  small-scale  BTL  plants  and  large-scale  offshore  gas-to-liquid
(GTL)  platforms  due  to  their  compact  and  modular  nature  resulting
from intensified heat and mass transfer. The isothermal performance of
microchannel  reactors  has  been  demonstrated  by  numerous  studies,
such as the one conducted by Wang and co-workers, and its scalability
has been proven by testing different channel lengths and numbers [245].
Results  have  shown  good  selectivity  and  conversion  after  prolonged
operation under various syngas compositions [242].

5. Towards a circular bioeconomy: Perspectives, avenues &
challenges

The  integration of  carbon  dioxide  into  the  circular economy  is  an
important aspect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating
the impacts of climate change. The use of CO2 as carbon pool in various
industrial processes and the development of modern technologies that
allow its capture, utilization, and permanent storage have the potential
to  drive  the  transition  towards  a  more  sustainable  and  low-carbon
economy.  Herein  we  identify  CO2-rich  syngas  as  potential  feedstock
for  the  next  generation  of  Fischer-Tropsch  units  whose  role  is  funda-
mental  to  deliver  green  fuels  at  scale  to  meet  the  current market  de-
mands on renewable energy carriers.

Future  challenges  in  Fischer-Tropsch  synthesis  include  improving
the  overall  process  efficiency  and  economic  aspects,  reducing  by-
products, and increasing targeted product selectivity, developing inno-
vative  catalytic  systems  with  improved  stability  and  longevity,  and
reducing  the  environmental  impact  of  the  process  using  renewable
feedstocks to curb emissions. Under this scenario we envisage two av-
enues  to  design  disruptive  FTS  units:  the  above-mentioned  CO2-rich
syngas as feedstock for the FT-process and the implementation of tan-
dem catalysis to intensify the process. This strategy permits the combi-
nation  of  FTS  with  upstream  (RWGS)  and  downstream  processes
(hydrocracking) in one-pot via implementation of multifunctional cat-
alysts. Ultimately, the combination of both leads to what we believe is an
ambitious  and  highly  innovative  FTS  strategy  by  designing  tandem
catalysts to deliver biofuels from CO2-rich flue gases in one single re-
action unit.

Precisely, the bottleneck for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using tandem
catalysis is the development of highly active and stable catalysts that can
effectively  convert  CO2-syngas  into  a  broad  range  of  useful  products
with high selectivity. Such multicomponent formulation is complex by
nature  and  must  include  custom-made  textural,  structural,  and
morphological properties as well as carefully selected active phase and
promoters.  This  imposes  deep  understanding  of  the  catalytic  mecha-
nisms involved, as well as the development of new materials and syn-
thesis  methods.  Further  challenges  include  controlling  the  reaction
conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, to
optimize the reaction and minimize by-product formation. Additionally,
as the demand for renewable fuels and chemicals increases, there is a
need  for  scalable  production  processes  that  can  be  implemented  at
commercial scale.

Beyond the catalyst’s formulation, the reactor design also plays a key
role  in  ensuring  high  performances.  FTS  and  hydrocracking  (HC)

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10115921

R. Blay-Roger et al.

technologies  typically rely on standalone  reactors with large volumes
which  are  limited  to  stationary  applications  within  the  oil  and  gas
sector.  The  lab-scale  integration  of  FTS  and  HC  in  a  single  micro-
structured reactor with integrated catalyst represents a step ahead to-
wards process simplification and intensification with evident impact in
biofuel  processing  technologies.  This  opens  new  horizons  in  reaction
engineering and reactor design to selectively control the FTS reaction
path by exploring microchannel reactors as a disruptive new technology
for integrated FTS and hydrocracking. Together with a new family of
advanced multifunctional catalysts, overcoming the limits of the con-
ventional  Anderson–Schulz–Flory  distribution  higher  conversion  to
target  intermediate  chain  length  hydrocarbons  for  liquid  fuels,
C10–C20,  can  be  achieved.  Implementing  both  reactions  in  micro-
channel systems will improve heat and mass transfer properties and will
facilitate optimum catalyst conditions perhaps leading to a revolution-
ary strategy for direct FTS of liquid fuels from bio-syngas.

The versatility of the microchannel reactor technology and its simple
scalability due to their modular nature maximize the flexibility of our
conceptual approach to delivering heavy transport biofuels (HTB). Such
a flexible approach rules out the limitations of rigid fixed bed reactor
designs which are heavy, bulky, and non-optimal in the biomass pro-
cessing scenario where in situ processing to avoid transportation cost is
essential.  Beyond  the  technical  advantages  of  microchannel  reactors,
their simplified scalability makes them ideal for distributed productions
and essential for delocalized and seasonal applications as for example
residues  in  farming  and  rural  scenarios  where  biomass  availability
fluctuates.

In this sense, this concept takes a forward-thinking vision by offering
a novel route in which biomass/bio-residues are processed in situ at the
source  production  point.  In  other  words,  this  pursues  in  situ  energy
intensification of the bio-feedstock to produce HTB avoiding extra CO2
emissions  ascribed  to  biomass/bio  residues  transport  to  biorefineries.
The latter is crucial to ensure techno-economic viability of biofuels for
heavy transport such as SAFs. Indeed, our market analysis indicate that
these green fuels are not always economically appealing in the current
scenario and progress in FTS technologies are deemed urgent to push
forward  SAFs  commercialization  at  large  scale  to  decarbonize  the
aviation sector.

To meet all these challenges, the progressive integration of machine
learning techniques will be essential from the authors viewpoint. Ma-
chine learning can assist in optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst
design by analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and predict
outcomes,  enhancing  catalyst  development  and  process  efficiency.
Implementing machine learning in this field will not be withouth chal-
lenges, as its adoption has been limited so far. Generating sufficient data
to  train  high-quality  models  will  be  difficult,  but  leveraging  data
collected  over  a  century  of  Fischer-Tropsch  research  may  help.  High-
throughput reactor techniques could also facilitate the use of machine
learning by rapidly generating valuable experimental data. Other chal-
lenges  will  include  understanding  the  interactions  between  multiple
catalyst properties, accurately predicting the effects of reaction condi-
tions, and finding ways to optimize production at commercial scale.

Overall, this review provides a fresh angle on a central process for the
chemical industry such as FTS. Departing from its genesis and historical
development we identify new trends and research avenues charting a
path for the next generation of FTS relying on advanced catalysts and
reactors in the context of a circular economy.
