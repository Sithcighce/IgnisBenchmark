Global climate change forces all countries to push the process of de-carbonization. Ammonia, which is carbon
free and a potential hydrogen carrier, is proposed as a prospective fuel for the power devices to realize the green
economy. It also exhibits very good fuel properties, including its storage condition, energy density. However, two
main challenges, the difficulties of flame stabilization and potential high fuel NOx  production, still need to be
tackled in its application in gas turbines. In the last decades, valuable investigations were conducted to address
characteristics  of  NH3/air  flame  stabilization  in  swirl  combustors  as  well  as  the  combustion  enhancement  by
cofiring with active molecule like CH4 and H2, applying plasma assistance. These measures mainly improve the
flame resistance to the flow and increase the key radicals at flame base, which may provide possible solutions to
the combustion chamber design. The inherent mechanisms of fuel NOx  production are highlighted by the HNO
channel with the presence of OH radical. One promising strategy to mitigate NOx in gas-turbine like combustor is
the staged combustion by staging the air or fuel, which may also fit for the practical combustion chamber. The
high-pressure condition and plasma assistance were found to show positive influence on both flame stabilization
and NOx  control. This review also emphasizes the fundamental research issues for ammonia fuel and proposes
some  future  research  prospects  towards  the  development  of  more  robust,  reliable,  and  low  NOx  combustion
technologies relevant to gas turbines.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

◦

Global warming caused by high level of industrialization has become
one  great  challenge  in  the  21st  century  for  the  mankind  [1–4].  The
average  global  temperature  is  increased  due  to  the  greenhouse  effect
that  traps  the  sun  radiation  heat  by  the  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  in
Earth’s atmosphere. Among all the different GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2)
contributes  the  largest  impact,  which  mainly  comes  from  the  con-
sumption of fossil fuels [5,6]. To deal with global warming, the Con-
ference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  was  established  for  proposing  ways  to
achieve  sustainable  energy  resources.  The  Paris  Agreement  [7]  was
made  by  COP  in  2015,  aiming  at  “holding  the  increase  in  the  global
◦
average temperature to well below 2
C above pre-industrial levels and
pursuing  efforts  to  limit  the  temperature  increase  to  1.5
C  above
pre-industrial levels”. Therefore, CO2 reduction is an important agenda
on  the  energy  policy  of  the  most  national  governments.  A  feasible
strategy is to build low-carbon/carbon-free sustainable energy systems,
since combustion of fossil fuels contributes a large portion of CO2 source.
Among all the future energy resources, hydrogen energy is widely
regarded as a promising renewable energy source due to its carbon free
nature [8–11]. Ammonia, which is also carbon-free, is recently recog-
nized  as  a  suitable  hydrogen  carrier  or  hydrogen  storage  medium
[12–16] in the hydrogen energy system. Ammonia is combustible and its
combustion only emits nitrogen and water ideally at stoichiometric air
fuel ratio, which is governed by the chemical reaction of 4NH3 + 3O2 →
2N2 + 6H2O + heat. Therefore, regarding ammonia as a fuel may pro-
vide a potential solution for the carbon reduction and the climate change
mitigation caused by large amount of fossil fuel consumption. The life
circle  of  “ammonia  for  power”  is  depicted  in  Fig.  1.  As  a  hydrogen
carrier, ammonia can either be produced from fossil fuels or renewables.
In comparison, ammonia production from renewable energy is a future
green roadmap in the energy economy since it emits zero CO2 through
its  life  cycle  [17,18].  Moreover,  ammonia  can  be  easily  stored  and
transported through various existing transportations, then it can be used
as the energy input to combustion systems and fuel cells as shown in
Fig.  1.  This  green  roadmap  of  ammonia  is  known  as  “Power  to  X  to

are collected from Refs. [37,46].

power”  [19–21],  which  aims  to  collect  renewables  by  storing  energy
with fuel then to provide power.

“Ammonia fuel” has attracted much attention in the past decade in
counties all over the world. For example, the Japan Science and Tech-
nology Agency (JST) has established the Green Ammonia Consortium to
promote research and development in utilizing ammonia as a fuel for
global warming countermeasures and energy security [22,23]. In United
States, Carnegie Mellon University and the NH3  Fuel Association have
conducted studies on how NH3 fuels can significantly reduce greenhouse
gas emissions from transportation [24–26]. Other regions or counties,
like European nations [27–30], Australia [31,32] also set programs to
establish ammonia value chain. Leading companies including Siemens
[21], General Electronic [33,34] also set joint research programs with
universities to develop combustion technologies of zero carbon fuels in
gas turbines (GTs). Therefore, the investigations on ammonia for power,
including ammonia fueled gas turbines, has become a hot research topic
in the combustion community [12,14–16,35–38].

1.2. Ammonia used as a fuel

Regarding ammonia as a fuel can be dated back to the 19th century
by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney who was an inventor and tried ammonia as
vehicular fuel for motorized applications in 1822 [41]. Researchers have
been testing the feasibility of ammonia as a fuel at early times [42]. In
the  1940’,  there  were  some  fundamental  investigations  on  the  fuel
properties  and  combustion  properties  [43–45].  During  World  War  II,
some regions and countries sought alternative energy sources for energy
security. Ammonia fuel was one of the important ones. This section gives
a glance on its fuel properties and compares it with other common fuels.

1.2.1. The fuel properties

Ammonia exhibits very good fuel properties and it is regarded as a
suitable  hydrogen  carrier  because  its  molecule  contains  17.6  %
hydrogen by weight. Ammonia is a colorless, pungent gas under ambient
temperature and pressure (0.1 MPa and 298 K). Ammonia can be liq-
uefied at very moderate conditions, with either being compressed to 0.8
MPa or cooled to (cid:0) 33
C. In contrast, liquid hydrogen can be obtained
only when the temperature goes below its critical point of (cid:0) 239.96
C
[37]. Hydrogen storage at room temperature requires very high pres-
sure. For example, gaseous hydrogen is pressurized to 70 MPa to keep
the sufficient energy when used in vehicles. Therefore, ammonia storage
is  easier  and  low  energy  consuming  in  liquid  phase  compared  to
hydrogen. Moreover, served as a fuel, liquid ammonia carries the com-
parable amount of energy as some hydrocarbon fuels, such as methanol
or  compressed  natural  gas.  The volumetric  energy density (VED)  and
gravimetric energy density (GED) of different fuels are summarized in
Fig. 2. The values of the high-pressure storage of natural gas (25 MPa)
and hydrogen (70 MPa) are also plotted in the figure. Diesel and gasoline
are the representatives of the liquid fossil fuel with high VEDs, which are
37.1 MJ/L and 34.0 MJ/L. The GED of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is
comparable with gasoline but it is stored in the 1.4-MPa tank in ther-
modynamic  equilibrium  with  its  vapors,  resulting  in  three  times  less
energy than gasoline. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is usually stored in
high  pressure  (25  MPa)  tank  especially  in  cars  to  catch  the  distance
range when using gasoline or diesel engines. It is regarded as a cleaner
alternative of liquid fossil fuels without SOx emission. However, fossil
fuels  are  non-renewable  with  carbon  dioxide  emission  or  other

When looking at liquid ammonia, the VGE is slightly higher than CNG
and liquid hydrogen, making it attractive to the power plants in cars,
power generations and propulsions.

liquid  hydrogen

Besides the energy density, ammonia also has other excellent qual-
ities. Table  1 compares its fuel characteristics, the  properties of com-
bustion,  storage  with  hydrogen,  CNG,  diesel,  LPG  and  kerosene.  The
density and storage temperature for ammonia are similar to gasoline,
demonstrating  a  good potential  in taking  the  same amount of  energy
with the existing size of fuel container. Secondly, the octane number is
almost  the  same  with  gasoline,  indicating  it  is  suitable  for  a  spark
ignition  for  internal  combustion  engines  (ICEs).  In  fact,  the  relevant
researches have been widely conducted in earlier times in ICEs [14,16].
Recently, it has been successfully applied as the fuel in the large-size
cylinder  ICEs  in  the  shipping  industry  [47].  Thirdly,  liquid  ammonia
has a high specific heat of 4.7 kJ/(kgK), which is one of the very few
liquids whose specific heat higher than water, i.e., 4.2 kJ/(kgK). This
property makes it exhibiting excellent cooling ability which is of very
great use on some occasions. For example, it was used as the fuel for
propulsion  (a  rocket  engine)  mainly  because  of  this  property  [48].
Lastly,  NH3  is  a  deoxidizer  for  NO  which  is  used  in  the  denitration
process  in  furnaces  [49].  It  may  also  help  to  reduce  NOx  in  other
ammonia combustion systems.

However, drawbacks are clear for ammonia. Due to the extremely
low reactivity, it is relatively difficult to burn completely and also en-
counters  some ignition difficulties.  Those are  the main  challenges for
ammonia fuel. The chemical properties of corrosive and toxic requires
corrosion-resistant storage device and sealing parts.

Haber invented the chemical synthesis of ammonia in 1908 [67] which
was then extended and developed to the industrial scale by Carl Bosch
ten  years  later  [68].  This  chemical  process  has  been  largely  used  till
today,  which  is  well-known  as  the  Haber-Bosch  process  (HBP).  One
important use of ammonia is to produce fertilizer to crops so that hun-
dreds of millions of people were fed in the last century due to this dis-
covery  [69].  Today,  ammonia  is  still  one  of  the  most  commonly
produced chemical feedstocks [14]. In the HBP, the reversible reaction
of  H2  + N2  ⇔  NH3  goes  forward  at  the  condition  of  600–750  K  and
15–30 MPa with an iron-based catalyst [70], as indicated in Fig. 1. The
efficiency of the HBP is about 25 % conversion per single run, while it
can reach an overall conversion efficiency up to 97 % with the unreacted
gases recycling.

Based on the energy driving HBP and the CO2  footprint, ammonia
can  be  classified  to  three  categories,  namely  brown  ammonia,  blue
ammonia and green ammonia [71]. Grey ammonia is the conventionally
produced one, from fossil feedstocks, most often from natural gas but
can also be produced from coal. In brown ammonia production, CO2 is
from feedstock itself and fuel consumption. Until now, ammonia used in
industry is  nearly 100  % brown ammonia,  which  is synthesized  from
fossil  fuels.  Hydrogen  production  in  HBP  is  highly  energy-consuming
and releases 90 % of CO2  emissions in ammonia synthesis. One com-
mon way to produce hydrogen is steam reforming of natural gas [72],
which  emits  1.6  tons  CO2  per  ton  of  ammonia.  In  comparison,  the
emissions of CO2 are 2.5 and 3.8 tons when hydrogen is obtained from
coal and heavy oil [69], respectively. When CO2 was trapped with car-
bon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), it is regarded as the blue
ammonia,  which  is  actually  produced  using  the  same  process  as  the
brown ammonia.  However, CCUS  process consumes extra natural gas
and  increases  the  cost  of  hydrogen  production.  With  the  increasing
concern of global warming, the cost of ammonia synthesis may depend
on  the  price  of  natural  gas,  electricity,  costs  of  CCUS  as  well  as  the
carbon  taxes.  Moreover,  the  price  of  fossil  fuels  may  exhibit  an
increasing trend due to the less and less reserves. Therefore, the blue
ammonia may only provide transition solution from conventional fuel
system to zero-carbon economy. Green ammonia comes from the syn-
thesis process without any fossil feedstocks and fossil fuel consumption
[16,73–75] which is produced entirely from renewable electricity, air
and water, as shown in Fig. 1. The production of nitrogen and hydrogen
as well as HBP are all driven by the renewable electricity generated from
wind or solar energy with zero CO2 footprint. However, the supply of the
renewable electricity is extremely unstable which is largely depended on
the weather. Due to the high energy consuming in HBP, recent efforts
have been put into ammonia synthesis under moderate conditions, such
as  microwave-enhanced  synthesis  for  HBP  at  0.1–0.65  MPa  and  tem-
◦
perature range of 280–400
C [76] and the mechanochemical approach
◦
at a temperature of 45
C and a pressure of 0.1 MPa [77]. Currently, the
cost of green ammonia is high since the industrial chain has not been
fully established.

There are numerous projects on green ammonia production in the
world. A downscaling green ammonia cycling system was demonstrated
at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory by a cooperated team of Siemens,
Cardiff  University,  the  University  of  Oxford  and  the  Science  &

Technology  Facilities  Council  (STFC)  [78,79].  In  this  demonstration,
renewable  electricity  is  generated  by  a  wind  turbine  and  is  used  to
separate  air  and  electrolyze  water  obtaining  nitrogen  and  hydrogen.
Ammonia synthesis is also finished with the renewable electricity. The
demonstration produces 30 kg green ammonia per day. Pushed by the
decarbonization demand, several projects of large-scale green ammonia
were approved in the United State [80], Europe [81] and China [82]. For
example, companies in Germany are planning to build a new plant in the
city  of Duisburg with  1000 tons of green  ammonia per  day,  which is
expected to begin operations in 2025 and to be one of the largest green
ammonia plants in Europe [81]. Various renewable ammonia projects
have already been announced in the northeast area in China. In Baotou,
a renewable ammonia factory will produce 390,000 tons green ammonia
per year in 2025 [82]. These green ammonia projects were supported by
the governments of those countries which implies that green ammonia
would be a common fuel in the future.

1.2.3. Cost of production, storage and transport

In the industry, ammonia is a widely produced and used compounds
with a global production estimated at 180 million metric tons in 2022
[83]. During the past 150 years since it was firstly synthesized, it is a
basic  chemical  feedstock  to  produce  fertilizers,  explosives  and  other
nitrogen-based  products.  Therefore,  there  are  mature  systems  of
ammonia production in the world. As mentioned earlier, the hydrogen
for ammonia synthesis is predominately from the stream reforming of
fossil fuels. However, with low carbon policy for all countries, the CCUS
or the renewable energy sources must be taken into account. The costs of
ammonia  production  from  different  ways  are  estimated  in  Fig.  3,  in

5

which the cost of hydrogen is evaluated from the steam reforming of
natural gas. The data is collected from Ref. [84] and the costs of three
kinds of ammonia are compared. CO2 emission is significantly reduced
by CCUS with the net value close to zero. However, the cost of green
ammonia (zero net CO2 emission) is much higher than brown ammonia
by using unabated fossil fuels. Moreover, the costs are widely varied due
to difference in the price of natural gas and electricity as well as the scale
of production. It is seen from the figure that the lowest cost of green
ammonia is already competitive with blue ammonia, which is largely
decided by the cost of renewable electricity. Therefore, it is expected
that the market price would be competitive if the ammonia production is
sited in the regions with abundant wind or solar power where the price
of renewable electricity is the lowest.

The  comparison  of  the  market  price  per  GJ  for  green  ammonia,
gasoline,  diesel  and  other  fuels  is  shown  in  Fig.  4 (a).  The  energy  is
calculated from the VED for each fuel in Fig. 2. The average prices of
gasoline and diesel are estimated from January 2015 to June 2022 in
Australia.  Error  bar  represents  the  price  fluctuation  during  this  time
period. The market price of the green ammonia is evaluated from Fig. 3
with 30 % profit considered. The price in 2030 is based on the renewable
electricity  cost  as  well  as  the  development  of  the  ammonia  synthesis
technology.  The  market  price  of  green  ammonia  is  higher  than  both
diesel and gasoline, while it would be comparable in 2030. It should also
be noted that CO2  tax is not concluded for diesel and gasoline which
would progressively increase in the future.

Since ammonia has been utilized as an industrial chemical feedstock
for nearly two centuries, it can be one of the best solutions of the sus-
tainable energy worldwide. One of the biggest advantages of ammonia is
the capability in carrying hydrogen and easy storage, either compressed
or refrigerated. This property makes it to be a competitive option for
storing  hydrogen  energy  and  transporting  it  by  pipeline  or  ship.  As
shown in Fig. 4 (b), transporting ammonia is a cheaper way in either
way. It is shown by recent studies [72,90] that ammonia would be the
lowest-cost  method  and  the  most  technologically-ready  option  for
transporting energy over long distances. Table 2 compares the cost of
hydrogen  within  its  life  cycle  in  liquid  phase  (LH2),  liquid  organic
hydrogen carriers (LOHC), and ammonia. It can be seen that ammonia
exhibits a lower cost, indicating it is a very good candidate of hydrogen
carrier  with  better  economics  for  long-distance  transportations.  For
example,  for  energy  importing  country,  such  as  China  or  Japan,  it  is
better importing ammonia from far regions than hydrogen. Moreover,
even  in  local  distribution  and  consumption,  ammonia  is  also  a
competitive compared with hydrogen due to the safety in its storage.

engines  [102].  Those  attempts  proved  the  feasibility  of  ammonia  for
power.

The early studies on the gas turbines fueled with ammonia date back
to the 1960s. From 1960s to 1980s, the US military tried to use ammonia
as fuel for aircraft engines and successfully developed X-15 hypersonic
aircraft [102]. The anhydrous ammonia and liquid oxygen were used as
the fuel and oxidizer in a Thiokol (Reaction Motors Division) XLR-99
throttleable  rocket  engine  to  drive  this  aircraft.  The  rationale  using
anhydrous  ammonia  in  this  project  was  largely  driven  by  the  appro-
priate properties as a liquid fuel, such as energy density, easy storage
and the large specific heat capacity, which is 4.7 kJ/(kg⋅K). This value is
even  larger  than  that  of  water,  which  makes  ammonia  exhibiting
excellent cooling properties. This aircraft set the unofficial records of
250500 N maximum thrust, 4520 mph altitude and completed a total
number of 199 flights.

For  GTs,  Pratt  et  al.  [103]  of  Berkley  University  of  California
analyzed parametric correlations of ammonia combustion in a gas tur-
bine  combustors  and  tried  to  operate  an  ammonia-fired  gas  turbine
combustors to investigate the combustion characteristics in 1967. They
established  a  simple  model  for  blowoff  limits  and  found  it  was  prob-
lematic utilizing gaseous ammonia as a turbine fuel because the chem-
ical loading value is an order of magnitude less than hydrocarbon fuels.
The possible solutions were to mix the fuel and air more efficiently in the
primary  zone  before  combustion  by  applying  smaller  fuel  nozzles  to
create  a  more  vigorous  fuel  jet,  and  to  utilize  multiple  parallel  com-
bustors  instead  of  one  single  large  combustor.  When  applied  to  gas
turbines, ammonia is not only quite difficult to be ignited, but also shows
extremely low combustion efficiency. In addition, the stable operating
range is very narrow [100,103]. In gas turbines, to realize the stable and
complete  combustion,  it  is  necessary  to  reduce  the  chamber  inlet  ve-
locity to ensure the sufficient combustion residence time due to the very
low  flame  speed.  However,  it  will  bring  new  problems  such  as  poor
fuel-air mixing and failing to burn under ideal mixing conditions [98].
There are numerous studies on the ammonia fueled gas turbines during
the  same  period  [98,104].  The  relevant  industrial  sectors  i.e.,  solar
turbines [105], Space Propulsion Group (SPG) advancing propulsion &
energy [106] and General Motors [104] also developed ammonia fueled

1.2.4. Advantages and challenges

After reviewing the properties of ammonia, here is the summary of

the advantages and challenges when ammonia is regarded as a fuel.

Advantages.

• Ammonia  is  a  suitable  hydrogen  carrier  for  the  systems  with

hydrogen input.

• Ammonia is a carbon-free molecule, emits zero CO2 emissions after

direct burning.

• Ammonia  can  be  produced  from  renewable  energy  with  zero  CO2

footprint.

• There are mature systems and technologies of ammonia synthesis.
• Ammonia storage and transportation in large scale are low cost.
• Ammonia exhibits considerable energy density.
• Ammonia shows the potential low production cost compared with

other fossil fuels.

Challenges.

• It is toxic and corrosive with a distinctive smell.
• The minimal ignition energy is high, causing ignition issues.
• It shows inactive reactivity, leading to a slow flame speed.
• It  is  a  nitrogen  containing  molecule  which  results  in  high  NOx

emission.

1.3. Attempts in ammonia for power

It  has  been  a  long  time  since  the  attempts  were  made  to  treat
ammonia as an alternative fuel for engines, such as internal combustion
engines  (ICEs)  [42,92–97],  gas  turbines  (GTs)  [98–101]  and  rocket

gas turbines one after another. These investigations demonstrate several
challenges in ammonia combustion: 1) hard ignition, 2) low combustion
efficiency, 3) poor flame stabilizing, 4) insufficient power supply. At that
time, the issue of “whether it can burn” hinders the high NOx emission of
ammonia  combustion.  These  earlier  attempts  before  the  21st  century
illustrate that it was fairly hard to operate a gas-turbine-like combustion
chamber  by  simply  replacing  the  traditional  hydrocarbon  fuel  with
ammonia.

Due to the international situations of limiting the carbon emissions
caused by global warming, the investigations on the application of low-
carbon fuel including ammonia have attracted more and more attention
over  countries in  the past decade. Many international research  teams
and industrial enterprises have started the research of ammonia fuel gas
turbine. In 2015, Kurata et al. [107–109] successfully operated a 50 kW
class micro gas turbine (MGT) fueled with NH3 at the National Institute
of  Advanced  Industrial  Science  and  Technology  (AIST)  Japan.  Fig.  5
shows the MGT generator used in their combustion tests. The final MGT

power generation of 41.8 kW was achieved burning 100 % ammonia gas,
as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  Based  on  this  MGT,  they  carried  out  a  series  of
experimental  studies  on  the  characteristics  of  flame  stabilization  and
NOx emission [107,109–111], with advanced gas turbine technologies,
such as heat-regenerative cycles. They also investigated the effect of fuel
air mixing, air supply strategies with two-stage combustion on the flame
stability and controlling of NOx. Valera-Medina et al. [14,16], from the
gas  turbine  research  center  of  Cardiff  University,  UK,  discussed  the
combustion characteristics of ammonia, the feasibility of using ammonia
as fuel in power system and the whole stages of ammonia chains, such as
production,  distribution,  utilization,  safety,  legal  considerations,  and
economic aspects.

For  large  demonstration  projects,  Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy  In-
dustries (IHI) [112,113] in Japan used IM270 simple cycle gas turbine to
evaluate  the  performance  of  NH3/CH4  co-firing  fuel.  They  used  a
two-stage  combustion  system  and  combined  with  SCR  to  reduce  NOx
emissions. The experiment achieved a power of 2 MW at 20 % ammonia

mixing  ratio.  CO2  emission  decreases  linearly  with  the  increase  of
ammonia concentration. NOx emissions can be as low as 10 ppmv when
SCR was applied. In 2022, they announced that this GT succeeded in
reducing greenhouse gases by over 99 % when fueling liquid ammonia,
truly achieving CO2-free power generation [114]. Mitsubishi Power is
developing a 40-MW class gas turbine fueled with 100 % ammonia based
on their H-25 series to respond global decarbonization as well as Japan’s
recent roadmap for ammonia fuel [115].

1.4. Paper scope and organization

Through  there  are  already  few  existing  ammonia-fueled  GTs  in
operation, fueling ammonia in modern GTs is still in the research and
development stage which needs a long way to go. To develop ammonia
combustion technology towards GTs, the general order of the combus-
tion research is concluded in Fig. 7. The first question should answer is
“whether it can burn”  in gas-turbine-like combustors. To burn it well,
the mechanisms of ammonia flame should be fully understood and it also
needs the combustion enhancement due to its slow combustion. Then,
the  pollutants  (NOx,  NH3)  should  be  controlled  to  meet  the  emission
regulations, which is also a permanent topic in engine design. Thirdly,
one should care the combustion stability when scaling the combustion to
a real GT. These might involve ignition issue, thermal-acoustic oscilla-
tions  etc.  Flashback  is  unlikely  to  happen  in  ammonia  combustion.
However, because all factors interact with each other, it is difficult to
strictly follow the priority in fundamental research in Fig. 7. Neverthe-
less, the majority of the investigations in literature focus on the first two
issues.  Therefore,  we  mainly  review  the  recent  progress  in  these  two
aspects in the following sections.

Gas turbines need compact combustion with large thermal power in
the combustion chambers to ensure a large power output. Therefore, gas
turbine combustors usually employ swirls to organize the flow thereby
increasing thermal power of the combustion and reducing the size of the
combustion chamber. This kind of geometry could produce large recir-
culation zones in the core part and the bottom conner of the chamber to
ease  flame  stabilization  and  improve  combustion  efficiency  by
enhancing  fuel  air  mixing,  recirculating  hot  gas  for  ignition  and
increasing the local flow residence time [117,118]. Real swirlers include
complex flow passages or veins with multiple obstacles and wing pro-
files [119]. In addition, the actual combustors in GTs usually have serval
stages of air and fuel inputs and the combustion occurs at the elevated
pressures, i.e., 2.0 MPa. For example, the fuel can be injected from the
inner  and  outer  swirler  simultaneously  in  a  practical  one  to  form  a
stratified  flame,  making  it  crucial  to  optimize  the  mixing  process  to
ensure  a  more  reasonable  and  stable  combustion  process  to  improve
combustion efficiency and reduce emissions [120].

The  “gas  turbine  model  combustors”  represents  the  combustors
which are largely simplified from the real gas turbine combustors, or
owns similar combustion organization elements with the real gas tur-
bine combustors, such as swirl flame in a confined space. In the current
study,  the  “gas  turbine  model  combustors”  largely  refers  to  the  swirl

combustors  with  single  stage  swirler  unless  otherwise  specified.
Laboratory-scale  swirl  burners  are  usually  designed  to  assess  the
fundamental flow and combustion aspects in controlled configurations
and allow laser diagnostics and high-precision simulation which orients
future developments and designs. Therefore, this paper mainly reviews
the investigations on flames in lab-scale gas turbine combustors (swirl
combustor),  which  owns  the  primary  importance  towards  ammonia
fueled GTs.

Recently, some review papers were published which reviewed the
ammonia combustion or industrial applications from a general point of
view [14,16,36,37,49,121–125]. This review intends to give a specific

bustors)  towards  the  combustion  techniques  of  ammonia  fueled  gas
turbines.  In  this  review,  we  aim  to  clarify  the  current  situations  and
challenges  towards  gas  turbine  model  combustors.  In  fundamental
research, the simple swirl combustors were largely implemented in the
literature. Investigations in this geometry can largely reveal the mech-
anisms  of  ammonia  combustion.  The  flow  of  this  paper  and  the
connection  of  each  section  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.  It  starts  with  the
fundamental flames (laminar and turbulent flames) properties in Section
2 to give a basic understanding of the ammonia combustion, such as low
flame  speed, large flame thickness and  quenching distance, high NOx
emissions as well as the combustion in turbulent cases. Then the char-
acteristics of the swirl flame, the stable mechanism, the stable region
and its extension are discussed in Section 3. One big target is to extend
the results to real gas turbine conditions, thus high-pressure combustion
and  liquid  ammonia  combustion  were  proposed.  In  Section  4,  the
emission from swirl flame is compared with 1D laminar flame and the
emission  behavior  of  co-firing  flames  is  demonstrated.  The  effects  of
cofiring  with  methane/hydrogen,  staged  combustion,  combustion
pressure, temperature and wall heat loss on NOx emissions are clarified.
In  Section  5,  we  also  propose  some  future  prospects  based  on  the
application  of  ammonia  fuel  in  gas  turbines  after  addressing  some
fundamental research spots.

2. Combustion properties

As discussed in the first section, ammonia presents good fuel prop-
erties and earlier attempts show the potential feasibility as a fuel in the
power devices. However, ammonia is far from large-scale applications in
GTs. The combustion performance, especially for a continuous flame, i.
e., swirl flame, is closely related to and decided by the basic properties of
the  fuel,  such  as  flammability,  laminar  flame  speed,  local  extinction,
turbulence-flame interaction. Understanding in these properties could
provide  a general  guidance to design ammonia fueled  combustors. In
this  section,  we  will  discuss  the  fundamental  combustion  properties
which may control the swirl flame stabilization and combustion emis-
sions. This section aims to offer some basic insights on how the flame
behave  in  laminar case  and some turbulent cases,  as well  as  its com-
parison with methane.

2.1. Flammability of ammonia

Earlier studies [126] show that the lean and rich flammability limits

are 15.8 % and 28.0 % fuel by volume in a standard tube with the spark
ignition at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. In comparison,
these limits are 5 % and 15 % for CH4 and 4 % and 75 % for H2 [125].
The measurements on the flammability limits by other researchers [45,
126–129] led to quite similar results. In fact, flame speed measurements
in the constant volume combustion chamber are also limited by flam-
mability limits. Hayakawa et al. [130] and Takizawa et al. [131] eval-
uated the laminar flame speed of NH3/air flames in various conditions in
a constant volume combustion chamber. However, the data could only
be  obtained  for  equivalence  ratios  between  0.9  and  1.2  at  ambient
pressure.  In  comparison,  this  range  is  from  0.6  to  1.4  for  CH4/air
spherical  flames  [132].  In  addition,  due  to  the  extremely  low  flame
speed, buoyancy shows great effect on the flame propagation, especially
for ultra-lean or rich conditions, as shown in Fig. 9. The measurements
in microgravity [133] show that the lean (rich) limits of NH3/air flames
are extended to about 0.8 (1.25), which is still narrower than that of
CH4/air flames. Even though the buoyancy effect is non-negligible, the
narrow  flammable  limits  nature  is  one  of  the  most  important  factors
determining  the  possible  measurement  range  for  spherical  flames,  as
suggested by Shy et al. [134]. The narrow flammable limits would cause
some combustion challenges in fueling ammonia in GTs. For example,
there  would  be  difficulties  in  flame  stabilization  when  the  flame  is
operated at low load conditions, when the fuel air ratio is small. Also, the
flame  is  prone  to  local  extinguished  in  transiting  the  operating
conditions.

2.2. Laminar flame speed and flame structure

Laminar flame speed (SL) is a key factor to examine how fast the fuel
burns which is crucial to construct the combustion laws under turbulent
case.  Comparing  with  hydrocarbon  fuels,  the  most  distinct  feature  of
NH3/air  flame  is  its  slow  laminar  flame  speed  SL.  Fig.  10 shows  the
unstretched  SL  as  a  function  of  equivalence  ratio  (φ)  measured  by
different  research  groups  with  different  methods  [128,130,131,133,
135–143]. The maximum SL is found when φ is around 1.1 and the value
is about 7 cm/s at 298 K and 0.1 MPa, which is one fifth of that of the
CH4/air flame at the same condition. The laminar flame speed will be as
low as 5 cm/s and 4 cm/s when the combustion pressure is elevated to
0.5 MPa and 1.0 MPa [144]. The extremely low flame speed resulted
from the low reactivity of ammonia molecule will bring challenges of
ignition  and  flame  stabilization  in  practical  engines  like  GTs.  Other
flame properties, like larger quenching distance δQ  [44,104,145–149],
and  lower  extinction  stretch  rate  Kext  [150–153] will  also  bring diffi-
culties  for  flame  stabilization  in  continuously  fired  burners.  Fig.  11
shows the comparison of quenching distance and extinction stretch rate
with  other  flames,  with  clearly  low  values  for  NH3/air  flames.  For
single-wall  quenching,  the  thermal  boundary,  designating  the  high
temperature-gradient  region,  is  thicker  when  the  flame  has  larger
quenching distance. The quenching distance relates to maximum wall
heat flux by δQ = ΔT⋅λ/Qw [154,155]. In the relation, δQ is the quenching
distance, Qw is the maximum wall heat flux, λ is the thermal conductivity
of gas (similar values for CH4/air and NH3/air mixtures), and ΔT is the
temperature difference across the quenching layer. Since δQ of NH3/air
flame is an order of magnitude larger than that of CH4/air flame, indi-
cating the maximum wall heat flux is much smaller for NH3/air flame,
which  can  be  easily  affected  by  wall  heat  loss.  Therefore,  the  larger
quenching distance indicates that the thermal boundary layer is thicker
and that the flame is more sensitive to heat loss. This implies that the
flame macro structure would be very sensitive to the thermal boundary
and the cooling strategy of the combustion chamber. In addition, the
flame is more prone to be locally extinguished by turbulence due to the
lower  extinction stretch  rate, since  the  resistance of  the flame  to  tur-
bulence is low.

Another great contrast between NH3/air flame and CH4/air flame is
the  flame  thickness,  which  will  largely  modify  the  flame  turbulence
interaction  and  the  turbulent  combustion  mode.  The  laminar  flame

structure at φ = 1.0, 298 K and 0.1 MPa is compared with that of CH4/air
flame in Fig. 13. According to the definition of flame thickness δT by the
heat release profile (shown in Fig. 13), δT  is about 3 mm for NH3/air
flame  while  is  only  0.8  mm  for  CH4/air  flame. A  visualization of  the
thickness  of  laminar  ammonia/air  Bunsen  flame  is  shown  in  Fig.  12
using the PIV set-up. It can be seen that this flame is much thicker than
most hydrocarbon flames [156,157]. This probably leads to a less active
flame response to turbulence under the flamelet concept since it needs
the vortex with larger scale to wrinkle the thicker NH3/air flame front
[158].  However,  the  two  features  (low  SL  and  large  δT)  result  in  the
NH3/air flames being more prone to locate at the broken reaction zone
in  the  turbulent  flame  diagram,  where  flame  broadening  may  occur.
Therefore, another point of view states that NH3/air flame is more likely
to exhibit flame broadening and to locate at broken reaction zone in the
turbulent flame diagram, since small-scale vortex is easier to enter the

preheat zone even the reaction zone. This would result in faster com-
bustion and be one possible advantage for ammonia. For example, in the
jet flames performed in Refs. [159–163], the Karlovitz (Ka) number is
4720  and  152  for  the  NH3/air  and  the  CH4/air  flame  at  φ  = 1.0,
respectively. This implies that the NH3/air flames are located far deep
inside the broken reaction region. However, other study argued that the
local  laminar  flame  approximation  (flamelet  concept)  may  be  invalid
due to its remarkable flame thickness [157].

2.3. Flame stabilization on bunsen jet flames

NH3/air  flame  can  hardly  be  stabilized  in  Bunsen  burner  at  both
laminar  and  turbulent  case  due  to  the  large  effect  of  heat  loss  to  the

and 1.2 within (cid:0) 20 mm < r < 20 mm. The data is taken as the averaged value between the two horizontal dashed lines. The scale bar is 5 mm and is shown as white

burner rim and its low flame speed. The mechanism of flame stabiliza-
tion of jet flames involves a balance between the incoming flow and the
flame speed, as well as the heat loss to the burner rim. To match the low
flame speed of NH3/air flame, a moderate flow is needed, resulting in a
low thermal power which is vulnerable by heat loss. Hayakawa et al.
[166]  stabilized  the  laminar  Bunsen  NH3/air  flames  in  a  14  mm  jet
nozzle at the pressure of 0.2 MPa and 0.3 MPa, as shown in Fig. 14 (a)
and (b). The flame is short which is caused by the lower nozzle outlet
velocity,  determined  by  the  blow-off  limits.  Therefore,  the  NH3/air
flame  may  be  only  anchored  with  moderate  nozzle  outlet  velocity.
Another investigation on laminar NH3/CH4/air flame by Rocha RC et al.
[167] shows that the outlet velocity of the jet can be only reached to
0.55 m/s with the maximal ammonia mole fraction ratio in the fuel of
0.8, as shown in Fig. 14 (c). Experiments of laminar NH3/H2/air flames
conducted by Kumar et al. [168] illustrate that the main flow velocity is
only 0.344 m/s for the case of 80 % ammonia (energy fraction) in the
fuel  while  it  can  be  as  high  as  11.7  m/s  for  H2/air  flame.  In  their
experiment, NH3/H2/air flames with 80 % ammonia were operated at a
tube with larger diameter of 11.11 mm to obtain this low velocity. In
comparison, H2/air flame was anchored in a 4.76 mm tube. The inves-
tigation on turbulent of NH3/CH4/air Bunsen flame by Ichikawa et al.

[158] show that the highest ammonia ratio is 0.2 by heat fraction in the
fuel (about 30 % by mole fraction). They did not success in stabilizing
the pure ammonia in their Bunsen burner. By comparing OH images in
Fig. 14 (d)(e) at the same turbulence intensity and combustion pressure,
the flame is higher and the smallest scale of the flame front wrinkles is
larger for the NH3/CH4/air flames. This would be due to the larger flame
thickness  when  ammonia  is  cofired  with  methane  as  we  discussed
earlier.  These  experimental  works  demonstrated  that  stabilizing
ammonia  flame  is  challenging  for  both  laminar  or  turbulent  Bunsen
flames. For the NH3/air jet flames with high outlet velocity in the order
of 100 m/s shown in Refs. [162,163,169], the flame stabilization needs
large amount of CH4/air co-flame to provide a hot atmosphere.

2.4. Turbulent spherical flames

The difficulties of flame stabilization in a Bunsen burner result from
the  low  flame  speed,  which  hardly  holds  the  balance  between  the
incoming  flow  and  fuel  consumption,  as  well  as  the  heat  loss  to  the
burner  rim,  which  extinguishes  the  local  combustion.  To  investigate
turbulence combustion, the turbulent spherical flame with flame prop-
agation is often employed also. Once the mixture was ignited, this kind

of  flame  needs  flame  kernels  at  initial  stage  which  is  affected  by  the
energy balance between the heat release from combustion and heat loss
to the unburned mixture.

Fig.  15 (a)  compares  the  flame  propagation  process  of  NH3/air
spherical flame in a constant volume combustion chamber for laminar
and  turbulent  cases  at  φ  = 1.0  [170].  The  experimental  set  up  was
described  elsewhere  in  details  [171,172].  For  laminar  case  (u’  = 0),
ammonia  burns  very  slowly  and  the  flames  are  floating  upwardly
illustrating a comparable behavior as the images in Fig. 9. This results
from the significant buoyancy effect during the flame propagation which
is caused by the extremely low flame speed. For the turbulent case, the
homogeneous and isotropic turbulence inside the chamber was gener-
ated through the stirring by four identical fans. The turbulence homo-
geneity and isotropy were verified in radius of 20 mm around the vessel
center experimentally [173]. For flame at turbulent case (u’ = 0.91 m/s)
at  the  same  equivalence  ratio,  the  flame  can  hardly  form  a  spherical
shape and expand outwardly due to the low reactivity of ammonia. This
illustrates that the heat loss effect due the turbulence during the ignition
is significant for ammonia combustion. This feature is also verified by
Lhuillier et al. [174] as shown in Fig. 15 (b). In their experiments, no
steady propagation regime was obtained. Nevertheless, the poor com-
bustion properties of the spherical flames can be effectively promoted in
oxygen enriched condition [175] or through adding H2 or CH4 [170,174,
176–178]. For example, the map of turbulent flame propagation limits
includes evidently larger area for NH3/CH4/air flame (ECH4  = 0.3) as
indicated by Hashimoto et al. [179] in their experimental results.

2.5. The emissions

Assuming an ideal one-step chemical reaction equation, the products
of ammonia combustion are H2O and N2 as discussed in the first section.
However, a large amount of NOx  is detected even for a steady laminar
flame  [180].  Fig.  16 shows  the  2D  measurement  of  the  intermediate
species  of  NH,  OH,  and  NO  on  the  center  plane  of  a  planar  NH3/air
premixed flame at φ = 0.9, 1.0 and 1.2. Due to the burner edge and the
non-uniformities of the flow from the burner plug, the flame shows a
curved flame front. NH only exists in a narrow region because it marks
the reaction zone. In comparison, NO shows a great difference for lean
and rich conditions. A strong NO signal intensity can be observed within
the  flame  and  in  the  post  flame  zone  for  φ  = 0.9.  The  intensity  is
decreased for φ = 1.0 and there is actually no visible NO signal intensity
in the post flame region for φ = 1.2. Quantitative species number density
profiles within (cid:0) 20 mm < r < 20 mm were plotted below each set of
images,  which  was  taken  as  the  averaged  value  between  the  two

12

horizontal dashed lines. NH densities of the three cases are close indi-
cating the similar heat release for φ = 0.9, 1.0 and 1.2. However, it is
readily seen that a large NO concentration is produced for the lean flame
while it is low for the rich flame, which is distinct CH4/air flame. Hay-
akawa  et  al.  [181,182]  measured  NO,  NO2,  N2O,  H2  and  NH3  slip  of
ammonia/air premixed laminar flames stabilized in a stagnation flow.
The results on NO show that the maximum NO mole fraction is about
3500 ppmv, at an equivalence ratio of 0.9, and it decreases when the
mixtures go to the rich side. For example, NO is only in the order of 100
ppmv  when  φ  = 1.1.  This  implies  that  large  NOx  emission  may  be
occurred when using NH3 as the fuel with excess air in practical engines
or combustion devices.

The emission characteristics of an NH3/air flame including species
like NO2, N2O and unburned NH3 can be evaluated through a 1D laminar
flame. Fig. 17 compares the main emissions of premixed NH3/air flames
and  CH4/air  flames  at  the  end  point  of  the  1D  propagating  flame,
calculated  by  CHEMKIN-PRO  [183]  using  the  chemical  mechanism
developed by Okafor et al. [165]. It was verified that this mechanism
provides good predictions of NO, NO2  N2O H2  and NH3  slip [181] for
NH3/air  flames.  For  CH4/air  flames  in  Fig.  17,  there  are  large  CO2
emissions, with a peak value at φ ≈ 0.91. The unburned CO becomes a
main pollutant at rich conditions due to incomplete combustion caused
by insufficient air. NO emission is low for lean flames and it increases
with φ  due to the  higher flame  temperature, since  NO is mainly  pro-
duced from N2 in the air via thermal-NOx mechanism. By the carbon free
concept, NH3/air flames do not feature carbon emissions. However, high
NO emission is observed at lean conditions and the maximum NO occurs
at the equivalence ratio of φ ~ 0.9. This is mainly due to the large OH
radical  concentration  in  lean  conditions  and  peak  value  at  φ  ~  0.9.
Moreover,  in  these  conditions  NO  emission  from  NH3/air  flame  is
several orders of magnitude larger than that of CH4/air flame. When φ >
1.1,  the  NO  concentration  is  largely  decreased  and  approaches
extremely low value for the rich flames, which is comparable with that
of CH4/air flame. From Fig. 17, it is seen that NO2 and N2O emissions are
much lower than NO for NH3/air flames, implying NOx is dominated by
NO. Based on the NOx  emission behavior, the “lean premixed combus-
tion”, a well-proven concept for natural gas to realize ultra-low NOx due
to  the  low  temperature  of  the  flame,  it  is  not  a  suitable  strategy  for
ammonia  combustion.  Besides  the  high  NO  emission,  there  are  large
unburned NH3 and H2 in the exhaust gas when φ > 1.15 which may also
be an issue in combustion devices.

speed, thick flame structure and large possibility of local extinguish as
reviewed  in  the  last  section.  Those  features  bring  new  challenges  to
stabilizing  the  continuous  flame.  Based  on  the  researches  on  laminar
flame, it is clear that the flame is weak and the flammable range is very
limited compared with methane fuel. It is even difficult to obtain a stable
turbulent Bunsen NH3/air flame without other additives. If we are trying
to apply ammonia as a fuel in gas turbines, the first question is that: can
we stabilize the flame in a gas-turbine-like combustion chamber? If yes,
what is the stable region and what is the difference in the flame stabi-
lization mechanism with CH4/air flame? In this section, we main talk
about  the  study  on  the  flame  stabilization  in  the  gas  turbine  model
combustor.

2.6. Combustion issues

3.1. Ammonia/air swirl flames

The  basic  combustion  properties  of  ammonia  were  reviewed  and
compared  with  methane  in  the  past  subsections,  which  decides  the
research  issues  implementing  ammonia  fuel  to  the  power  devices.
Fig. 18 concludes the relation of chemical nature, combustion properties
and the resulted research issues in this field. The first chemical nature is
the  strong  N–H chemical  bond in  its  molecule, resulting  in high acti-
vation energy or large ignition energy burning ammonia. This would be
a big challenge when fueling ammonia in spark ignition engines, which
will  not  be  reviewed  in  this  work  since  it  is  mainly  included  in  ICE
cylinders. The second chemical nature is the low reactivity resulting in
the long chemical time scale. This would moderate the heat release and
the  fuel consumption, further exhibiting coupled features reflected as
the  thick  flame  and  low  flame  speed,  which  brings  difficulties  in
continuous flame. The combined effects of the first and second chemical
nature  would  cause  flame  local  extinction  and  NH3  slip.  The  third
chemical  nature,  high  N  content  (82.4  %  by  weight),  makes  the  NOx
production mechanism very distinct with CH4/air flame, namely high
NOx and leads to high risks to emit another greenhouse gas, N2O. These
properties listed in Fig. 18 are essential to understand the flame char-
acteristics in gas-turbine-like combustors as discussed in Section 3 and
Section 4.

3. Flame stabilization and blow-off of swirl flames

The  earliest  attempts  on  ammonia  fueled  gas  turbine  model  com-
bustors can be dated back to 1960’s [100,104,184]. The main focuses of
those investigations were to discuss the feasibility of ammonia as a fuel
in combustion chambers which were scale modeled from real gas tur-
bines. It was mainly concluded that there were large difficulties on flame
stabilization  in  gas-turbine  burners  optimally  sized  for  hydrocarbon
fuels [100,104]. Though there were also some studies from 1960’s to
1970’s, the investigations of ammonia combustion for gas turbine uses
have  been  a  non-mainstream  topic  until  it  became  plentiful  again  in
early  2010’s  due  to  the  climate  change  issue.  In  the  past  decade,  in-
vestigations on ammonia combustion including gas turbine background
have  been  sharply  increased  [14,37,39,124].  It  has  proposed  as  a
long-term target fueling ammonia in GTs for the combustion commu-
nity. Swirl flames, being a modeled geometry of combustor in GTs, has
received much attraction in the literature.

It has extensively been proved that NH3/air flames can be success-
fully  stabilized  in  swirl  combustors  [185–195]  with  different  burner
dimension,  burner  geometry  and  swirl  number  S.  Swirl  number  mea-
sures the ratio of the axial flux of the swirl momentum to the axial flux of
the axial momentum, which is obtained by integration across an axial
cross-section [196–198]:

Fig. 19 shows a direct comparison of the photography between NH3/
air  flames  and  CH4/air  flames  [185].  A  distinct  feature  of  premixed
NH3/air flame is the orange chemiluminescence. In hydrocarbon flames,
the visible blue color is resulted from carbon in the fuel. In contrast, the
orange color appearing in NH3/air flame is caused by the NH2α  band
[199] and the super-heated H2O vapor spectra (with HITRAN Database
[200]). In addition, due to the low laminar flame speed of NH3/air, the
flame residence time is longer and the flame is much higher than that of
CH4/air  flame  at  the  same  flow  condition.  As  a  result,  a  longer

chamber  is  shown  in  Fig.  20(a).  The  followed  studies  were  also  per-
formed [185–187] in a similar experimental configuration, as shown in
Fig. 20(b). For the swirl burner shown in Fig. 20, air and fuel premixture
enters the burner after fully premixed. Different swirlers with 12 vanes
were used to investigate the swirl number effect. The parameters of the
swirlers are shown in Table 3. And the size of combustion chamber can
also be easily adjusted to explore a suitable chamber geometry.

The  effect  of  chamber  length  on  flame  appearance  under  various
equivalence  ratio  φ  and  chamber  inlet  velocity  Uin  can  be  directly
observed from the images as shown in Fig. 21 [190]. The NH3/air flame
was full of the combustion chamber and even out of the burner exit at φ
= 1.0 and 1.2 when the combustion chamber length was 100 mm. The
comparison of NH3/air and CH4/air flames in Fig. 21 (a) and (d) in a
same  burner  configuration  shows  that  the  flame  is  much  longer  for
NH3/air flame, which is caused by the low flame speed of NH3/air, as
discussed  in  Section  2.2.  To  further  enclose  the  flame  within  the
chamber, it required the use of a 200 mm length chamber as shown in
Fig. 21 (e)–(f). And the shortest flame length corresponds to the stoi-
chiometric  condition  of  φ  = 1.0,  which  exhibits  a  similar  trend  with
CH4/air flame. Fig. 22 shows the swirl number effect on the flame macro
structure for both NH3/air flame and CH4/air flame [185]. It is readily
seen that the swirl number effect on flame macro structure on the two
flames are similar. For CH4/air flame, the flame shows shorter ORZ and
the flame is rolled into ORZ at S = 0.73. In comparison, swirl number
only exhibits an effect in elongating the ORZ for NH3/air flame while no
flame can be observed in ORZ in both cases. This suggests CH4/air flame
shows larger capability in flame stabilization than NH3/air flame in the
same geometry since the hot products in ORZ have an extra contribution
to flame stabilization.

Compared with CH4/air flame, premixed NH3/air swirl flame can be
only  stabilized  within  a  limited  equivalence  ratio  range.  The  in-
vestigations of [37,185,190] illustrate that the stable regions of the swirl
NH3/air  flames  are  much  narrower  than  that  of  CH4/air  flames.  The
stable region of NH3/air flames accompanying with CH4/air flames for
different chamber length and swirl number flames are shown in Fig. 23.
The “stable region” is defined by the lean blow-off limit, rich blow-off
limit  and  the  flashback  limit,  indicated  in  Fig.  23.  Flashback  and
blow-off are determined by the velocity balance between the incoming
flow and the burning velocity [201]. Generally, the flashback velocity is
regarded  as  the  lower  speed  limit  of  the  incoming  flow,  while  the
blow-off  velocity  is  the  upper  limit  of  the  incoming  flow  at  a  certain
operating  condition.  In  experiments,  the  blow-off  phenomena  can  be

combustion chamber may be required when applying ammonia to gas
turbines. The fuel properties mentioned in the earlier section result in
poor stabilization limits for both premixed and non-premixed ammonia
combustion modes. Therefore, the first research issue for the ammonia
combustion community is the flame stabilization region and the mech-
anism of stabilization.

3.1.1. Premixed swirl flame

The first issue of the swirl ammonia flame is the flame stable region
which is defined by the lean blow-off limit, rich blow-off limit and flash
back limit. One purpose of the investigation in a simple swirl burner was
to recognize the flame characteristics and to explore the stable region.
Another purpose is to reveal the scientific difference of the swirl flame
between the hydrocarbon fuel and ammonia. A study on the influence of
the swirl number and chamber length on flame structure and blow-off
limits  was  conducted  by  Hayakawa  et  al.  [190]  in  a  simple  swirl
combustor. They stabilized the premixed NH3/air flames in a lab-scale
gas  turbine  based  swirl  combustor  with  two  different  combustion
chamber length, namely 100 mm and 200 mm and swirl number from
0.736  to  1.27.  The  schematic  and  the  dimension  of  the  combustion

visible in Fig. 23. Similar conclusions are obtained by Zhou et al. [191]
in a model combustor by investigating the effect of swirl number, liner
length and the bulk flow rate of the mixture.

Fig. 24 shows the swirl number effect on different flames conducted
by Zhang et al. [185]. The results are similar to Fig. 23, since the burner
geometries are similar. For the NH3/air flames, the lean blow-off limits
were barely changed or extended when increasing S for their burner. For
each S in Fig. 24, the lean blow-off limits of φb  ≈ 0.65 are observed.
However,  the  flame  behaviors  are  quite  different  for  flames  when
increasing  S,  especially  when  approaching  blow-off  limits.  A  clear
extension in the lean blow-off limits is presented when increasing the
swirl  number  for  50%NH3  flame.  The  swirl  number  was  originally
defined from the ratio of the axial flux of angular momentum to the axial
flux of axial momentum [202,203], which is a measurement on the swirl
motion. It is well recognized that the swirl number presents an impor-
tant impact on the flame dynamics including flame stabilization. Early
studies [204,205] underlined the role of the swirl number in affecting
the flame structures. However, the influence of S on NH3/air flame is
very  limited  due  to  the  low  flame  speed  (reactivity)  and  the  small
extinction stretch rate (small resistance to stretch). This behavior should
be fully aware in the combustor design for ammonia use.

Even though the stable region of NH3/air flame is narrow, Kobayashi
et al. [37] show that the flame can be stabilized at a chamber inlet ve-
locity up to 40 m/s with the thermal power larger than 25 kW at normal
pressure,  as  shown  in  Fig.  25.  When  Uin  increases,  the  lean  and  rich
blow-off  limits  are  moving  towards  the  stoichiometry  condition
accordingly, indicating more unstable flame. For example, the lean and
rich limits are about 0.95–1.1 when the flame is operated at about 27 kW
with the velocity at chamber inlet of 40 m/s, which means the flame will
blow away by either increasing or decreasing fuel. In contrast, a stable
region from 0.75 to 1.4 is obtained at Uin  = 5 m/s, which are largely
extended and close to the lean and rich flammability limits (0.63 and
1.40). Fig. 25 further proves the feasibility of applying ammonia in GTs.

3.1.2. Non-premixed swirl flame

Non-premixed combustion is usually applied in GTs which aims to
ensure  the  safety  of  combustion  and  to  control  the  combustion  more
efficiently.  However,  non-premixed  combustion  involves  the  fuel-air
mixing process, which would also bring negative aspects to ammonia
combustion since its molecular diffusivity is relatively weak. Studies on
the non-premixed ammonia swirl flames by Okafor et al. [188,189] in a
micro gas turbine (MGT) combustor with a fuel input power of 31.44 kW
prove that fuel air mixing largely influence the blow-off limits. Fig. 26
shows the schematic diagram of the combustor which has detachable
fuel  injectors  surrounded  by  a  swirler  for  air  injection  with  a  swirl
number of 0.88. Fuel was injected by twelve 2.4 mm diameter injection

with different injection angles. For the non-premixed flames, the fuel
injection angle θ seems to show a great impact on the flame stabilization
since the combustion is depended on fuel-air mixing and fuel residence
time in the combustor. The flame is lifted for the vertical fuel injection
(θ  = 0

obtained either by increasing the incoming flow velocity or decreasing
the burning velocity. The experimental findings (Fig. 23) show NH3/air
flame can be stabilized at different chamber inlet velocity and equiva-
lence ratio with swirl flow. However, the stable region of NH3/air flame
is narrower than that of CH4/air flame. It is seen that swirl number S
slightly decreases the stability limits which may be caused by the smaller
extinction stretch rate. A much wider stable region is observed for cy-
lindrical  chamber.  However,  the  influence  of  the  liner  length  is  not

resulted  from  the  local  evaporation  of  liquid  ammonia  droplets.  To
understand this process in detail, Colson et al. [207] recently studied the
breakup characteristics of liquid ammonia under superheated condition
and  found  that  the  flash  boiling  mainly  drove  the  break-up  process,
which will result in the greatly reduced droplet diameter. A recent DNS
study by An et al. [207] also showed that smaller droplets can rapidly
flash,  leading  to  strong  local  heat  loss,  significantly  reducing  flame
propagation speed and heat release, ultimately causing local extinction,
which will significantly deteriorate the flame stabilization.

Recent researches of Okafor et al. [208,209] demonstrate a  stable
combustion of liquid ammonia spray can also be obtained using a swirl
combustor,  which  is  shown  in  Fig.  29 (a).  In  their  work,  the  liquid
ammonia was injected by a nozzle in the diameter of 0.28 mm with a
◦
. Methane can also be provided through 16 holes with
spray angle of 90
the diameter of 1.8 mm surrounding the spray nozzle. Since the latent
heat of vaporization is large for liquid ammonia, the preheated air was
tangentially injected through eight rectangular slits of the radial swirler,
to provide the heat of vaporization. The PIV results of in the combustion
chamber show that there is a large inner recirculation zone and strong
back-up flow in the axis of combustor [209], which can effectively mix
the fuel and air. Pure liquid ammonia spray flame can be successfully
stabilized in this combustor which is shown in Fig. 29 (b). Due to the
vaporization of liquid fuel and the mixing with air, however, the flame is
too high and out of combustion chamber. However, Hayakawa [210]
and Yamashita [211] proved that pure liquid ammonia spray swirl flame
can be obtained within the equivalence ratio range of about 0.72–1.55
by  increasing  the  chamber  inlet  temperature  to  700  K,  as  shown  in
Fig.  30.  The  requirement  of  a  high  air  temperature  may  match  the
operating  conditions  in  GTs,  makes  LNH3  more  potential  in  a  more
compact combustion chamber.

Due to the flash boiling and its large latent heat of evaporation, the
temperature near the nozzle was found close to even lower than 240 K
[212].  This  would  possibility  cause  local  distinction  further  causing
flame destabilizing. This issue was addressed by Somarathne et al. [213]
with numerical analyzing. They verified the numerical model by using
experimental  measurements  of  non-reacting  liquid  ammonia  spray  at
0.1 MPa. They successfully conducted NH3(l)/H2(g)/air co-combustion
at 0.3 MPa with a newly designed burner and preheated air at 600 K
under the condition of NH3 blending ratio at 50 % ~ 100 %, as shown in
Fig. 31. They pointed out that although the temperature near the nozzle
◦
tip area is about 270–280 K (close to 0
C), the large recirculation area in
the combustion chamber plays a crucial role in enhancing the mixing of

stable region as a consequence. For inclined fuel injection, there is no
visible effect on lean blow-off limits φb,l when increasing θ, while φb,r is
extended  by  increasing  θ.  The  extension  on  φb,r  is  resulted  from  the
enhanced fuel and air mixing near the injection holes when increasing θ
for rich conditions.

3.1.3. Liquid ammonia spray swirl flame

In  the  current  literature,  most  studies  reviewed  above  involve
gaseous  ammonia  in  the  combustion  chamber.  However,  one  great
shortcoming of gaseous ammonia combustion in power plants is the high
energy costs on the fuel vaporization due to its high large latent heat of
vaporization (1.17 MJ/kg at 298 K), corresponding to more than 6 % of
its lower heating value (18.7 MJ/kg at 298 K) [206]. The large-scale
gaseous ammonia fuel supply system requires extra devices such as va-
porizers and accumulators to ensure the continuous fuel supply, which
will  result  in  additional  products  and  operating  costs.  Therefore,  one
possible solution is directly injecting liquid ammonia in the combustion
chamber. In fact, in the early studies of Verkamp et al. [104] in 1960s,
they tried to burn liquid ammonia at various air inlet conditions and
failed to stabilize the swirl flame due to the high latent heat of vapor-
ization  as  well  as  the  low  flame  speed.  After  the  ignitor  was  extin-
guished,  the  flame  was  locally  extinct  and  it  further  caused  flame
blow-off.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  rapid  temperature  decrease

thermal combustion products and liquid ammonia vapor, thereby pro-
moting flame stability.

3.2. Flame stabilization and blow-off

The flame stable region at a certain Uin is determined by the lean and
rich blow-off limits resulted from the swirl flow and flame interaction.
Ammonia  combustion  differs  significantly  from  hydrocarbons  and
hydrogen due to its unique properties such as lower flame speed, tem-
perature,  and  slower  reaction  kinetics.  Therefore,  the  main  aspect  of
instability  phenomena  in  ammonia  swirl  flames  is  the  flame  blow-off
caused  by  the  low  flame  speed.  The  stabilization  mechanisms  of
ammonia swirl flame are mainly due to the recirculation zone generated
by strong swirl flow, which continuously ignites the fresh mixture with
the  high-temperature  burned  products.  The  differences  in  stability

mechanisms between ammonia and other fuels are mainly reflected in
the following two aspects. 1) ammonia’s lower flame speed and higher
ignition energy compared to hydrogen and most hydrocarbons; 2) the
blow-off characteristics of ammonia flame will be influenced by varia-
tions in flame structure and temperature distributions.

Further experiments by Zhang et al. [185] explained the mechanism
by detecting the aerodynamic features and the flame macro structure.
Experimental facilities include particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) and
planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH species (OH-PLIF), measuring
the  velocity  field  and  the  flame  macrostructure,  respectively.  Fig.  32
shows the instantaneous flame structure (represented by OH-PLIF im-
ages)  with  the  decreasing  equivalence  ratio  at  S  = 0.73.  This  figure
demonstrates that the flame stabilization mechanism is largely different
by comparing the flame macrostructure transition between each flame
in the same flow condition. When decreasing φ, CH4/air flames in outer

recirculation  zone  (ORZ)  gradually  disappear  and  then  the  flame  at
outer shear layer (OSL) is rolled up. Local extinction is observed at the
flame base and the flame slightly lifts off when the mixture further goes
to  leaner  side.  The  flame  encounters  strong  stretch  compared  to  its

extinction  stretch  rate  in  the  shear  layer  before  blow-off.  The  whole
blow-off  process  of  50%NH3/air  flames  is  similar  to  that  of  CH4/air
flame, by shifting the flame structure transition to richer side due to the
smaller resistance to flow stress and heat loss. In comparison, for the

NH3/air flame, however, no flame in the recirculation zone is seen even
at φ = 0.8 due to the less intensive combustion.

When gradually decreases φ from a stable flame, a general feature of
the flame macrostructures can be observed as [214]: 1) an “M”  shape
flame; 2) a “V” shape flame; 3) a bubble flame followed by a columnar
flame; (d) a lifted flame. Fig. 33 (a) shows the transition of the flame
macrostructure which designated as flame I, II, III and IV, identified by
the sharp boundary of the OH distribution. The swirl stabilized flame
will gradually lose the stabilization. The flame macrostructure transition

from II to III is crucial and can be viewed as a precursor event of the
blow-off  as  φ  gradually  decreases.  The  transition  behavior  is  clearly
observed in Fig. 33 (b) for 50%NH3/air and CH4/air flames within the
entire range of Uin. However, no clear transition is noticed when Uin is
below 3.8 m/s for the NH3/air flame, which means the flame would be
suddenly blown away from a stable condition. The transition curve can
be viewed as the early warning of blow-off on a swirl stabilized flame,
which can be used as a guidance in combustor design.

suddenly decreasing equivalence ratio to a very lean condition provide
an understanding of the blow-off process. The comparison of NH3/air
and CH4/air flames was demonstrated by heat release rate (HRR) evo-
lution and the joint PDFs of stretch rate and HRR, as shown in Fig. 34.
The reference time t = 0 m s corresponds to the instance of the equiv-
alence ratio decreasing. In the simulation, the flame can be easily indi-
cated  by  the  HHR  region,  as  shown  in  Fig.  34.  Based  on  the  HRR
obtained from laminar flame, the maximum HRR values are 1.2 × 108
J/(m3 s) and 3.0 × 108 J/(m3 s) for NH3/air flame and CH4/air flame.
Then, the local extinction was defined when the local HRR goes below
20 % of the maximum value. A clear difference was observed for the two
flames during the blow-off process by viewing the HRR profile. When
look at CH4/air flame, due to the φ decreasing, HRR firstly decreased at
flame base and then the flame was locally distinguished (by the criteria
of  HRR  below  20  %)  in  the  early  stage.  As  a  result,  the  flame  was
instantaneously lifted off and the lift-off distance is gradually increasing
as time advances. However, the flame front is always preserved down-
stream. It seems that the flame was pushed downstream by the fresh gas.
In comparison, this process was distinct for NH3/air flames at φ = 0.7
(SL  ≈ 2.42 cm/s). Due to the low reactivity and the weak combustion,
the flame was extremely unstable. The entire flame suddenly suffered

extinguishing even at t = 3 m s which leads to faster blow-off process.
The possible explanations can be concluded as 1) the physical effect
which is mainly caused by the excessive stretch, Kext and 2) the thermal
effect (chemical effect) which comes from the decrease in combustion
intensity indicated by HRR. The flame tends to be extinguished either by
encountering  the  excessive  stretch  or  decreasing  HRR  below  the
extinction HRR (HRRext). By analyzing the joint PDF of the stretch rate K
and HRR as well as Kext and HRRext illustrated in Fig. 34, it can be seen
that a large portion of the flame was suffered from the excessive stretch
during the whole blow-off process for NH3/air flame. This would be the
main contribution to of the transient process. In comparison, the HRR
plays a major role for CH4/air flame. This suggests that NH3/air flame
needs a moderate flow and explains that the blow-off limits cannot be
enhanced by solely increasing S. These conclusions were also verified by
Wei et al. [215].

3.3. The extension of stable region

The engines, like GTs, always need wide operating conditions, which
requires a wide stable region of the flames in combustion chamber. The
low reactivity, low flame speed and large ignition energy as discussed in

earlier sections lead to a poor flame stable range. The question is that:
how can we extend this range? The ultimate answer to a long-term so-
lution may be a brand-new design of the combustion chamber or the
engine. However, now we probably need to provide the answer based on
the current combustion chambers in the transition phase towards a more
sustainable and renewable energy system.

3.3.1. Methane/hydrogen addition

One  main  reason  causing  the  difficulties  on  flame  stabilization  of
NH3/air flame is the low flame speed resulting from the low reactivity.
Thus,  the  addition  of  active  small  molecule  to  the  unburned  mixture
could be a direct way to enhance the flame stabilization by enhancing

the chemical effect and physical effect. The analysis on the 1D laminar
flame  demonstrates  that  the  OH  enhancement  can  be  obtained  by
blending with small active molecules like CH4 and H2. This can be also
clearly observed through the OH intensity of the swirl flames. Fig. 35
shows the digital flame images of NH3/air flame and NH3/CH4/air flame
at XCH4  = 10 % with equivalence ratio [187,216] in the same burner
shown  in  Fig.  20 (b).  Comparing  the  flames  in  Fig.  35,  the  orange
chemiluminescence was weakened and the flame was shortened for the
case of XCH4 = 10 %, similar with the results in Ref. [217]. Fig. 36 shows
the  variation  of  instantaneous  OH-PLIF  images  of  the  NH3/air,  10%
CH4/NH3/air flame, 30%CH4/NH3/air flame with equivalence ratio. А
clear extension on the lean stable limit was observed by adding a small

amount of methane. It is seen that the OH intensity seems to reach its
highest value around φ ≈ 0.8. Moreover, when comparing image at same
φ, the local OH intensity at the flame location is larger when XCH4  in-
creases,  indicating  the  enhancement  on  OH  radicals.  The  combustion
enhancement will be larger when applying H2 as the addictive [187,192,
216,218,219]. The measurement of Zhou et al. [192] also verified that
hydrogen had an obvious stabilizing effect on NH3/air flame. The lean
and rich blow-off limits were apparently extended as increase of XH2, by
observing the flame gradually transferring from a “V” shape to an “M”
shape.

Khateeb  et  al.  [194,195]  plotted  the  stable  region  for  the
NH3/CH4/air flame and NH3/H2/air flame with XNH3 from 0 to 1.0. The
experiments  were  performed  at  a  swirl  burner  placed  in  the
high-pressure combustion chamber, as shown in Fig. 37. Fig. 38 shows
flame  stable  region  of  NH3/CH4/air  swirl  flames  as  a  function  of  the

ammonia fuel fraction XNH3  for S = 1.00 and Re = 5000. The flamma-
bility  limits,  which  were  linearly  interpolated  from  the  experimental
data were also plotted showing CH4  addition on the flame properties.
The  equivalence  ratio  corresponding  to  the  rich  (lean)  flammability
limit is extended from φ = 1.46 to φ = 1.69 (from φ = 0.63 to φ = 0.48)
by gradually replacing NH3 by CH4 [220]. The region of the swirl flames
is within the flammability limits and the effect of CH4 on the extension of
the flame stable is clear. In Fig. 38, the flame stable range is determined
by the balance of the burning velocity, largely depending on laminar
flame  speed,  and  the  inlet  velocity.  Thus,  the  flame  stable  region  in
Fig. 38 is bounded by lean blow-off limits, the rich blow-off limits and
the  flashback  limits.  The  equivalence  ratio  range  of  stable  flames  is
widened when the fraction of methane increases for XNH3 > 50 %, which
is resulted from the increased laminar flame speed. At Re = 5000, the
rich blow-off event will occur if flashback did not happen at φ ≈ 1.05,
since the maximum laminar flame speed corresponds this equivalence
ratio [135]. In this case, the flame speed is too large to stabilize the flame
and  the  flame  propagated  toward  upstream  until  the  flame  was
destroyed. As can be observed in the figure, the upper limit of equiva-
lence ratio stabilizing flame suddenly switched to flashback limit when
further increasing XCH4, which is mentioned as the transition behavior.
Fig. 38 (b) gives the transition behavior at different Reynolds number.

Recent studies on the liquid ammonia swirl spray flames showed the
same behavior. Fig. 39 shows the stable flame region and flame images
of NH3/CH4/air co-firing flame at different ENH3. Image (a) and (f) show
the  structure  of  the  flame  near  the  lean  and  rich  blow-off  limits
respectively, which illustrates the similar flame macro-structure as gas
ammonia swirl flame [190]. Image (b), (c), (d) and (e) are the flames
within stable range, plotted by cross marks in the φ-Uin  diagram. The
diagram  clearly  shows  that  the  stable  flame  region  is  widened  by
increasing the methane fraction. Besides the increasing burning rate by
methane addition, another important reason for extended stable range is
the increasing enthalpy of preheated air relative to latent heat of liquid
ammonia evaporation. At a given equivalence ratio, the flow rate and
total  enthalpy  of  preheated  air  increases  with  the  methane  fraction,
caused  by  the  increasing  chemical  air/fuel  ratio.  For  liquid  ammonia
combustion, the heat provided to vaporization could be an important

physical effect resulted from flow stress (indicated by excessive stretch)
and 2) the chemical effect, resulted from low concentration of the in-
termediate radicals. In particular, the local re-ignition by heat deposi-
tion  and  the  active  species  pools  produced  by  plasma  provided  an
additional anchoring mechanism to stabilize the swirl NH3/air flames.

factor  for  flame  stabilization.  The  experimental  results  of  Yamashita
et al. [211] showed that the stable region of pure swirl spray ammonia
flame can also be extended by increasing the chamber inlet temperature,
as shown in Fig. 30.

3.3.2. Plasma assisted ammonia combustion

Since the key radicals can enhance the combustion by accelerating
the reaction rate of the key pathways, one effective way is the plasma
assistance for ammonia combustion. Plasma ionizes, dissociates the fuel
molecules and recombines the radicals which could also produce the key
species for combustion enhancement. One of the best understood parts
of plasma is that plasma enhances chemical kinetics, thereby shortening
ignition  delay,  lowering  oxidation  temperature  and  increasing  flame
speed [222–225]. Therefore, it can be used to strengthen the combustion
in ignition process in extreme conditions, such as low temperature and
rare  air  conditions  [226]  and  to  extend  the  stable  regions  for  swirl
flames  [227,228].  Having  these  advantages,  plasma  would  provide  a
grateful  strategy  to  ammonia  combustion  by  compensating  its  inade-
quate fuel properties. The numerical works show plasma activation in-
creases flame speeds and reduced ignition delays [229,230], thus giving
a  potential  solution  to  enhancing  the  flame  stabilization.  Further  in-
vestigations  on  flame  stabilization  and  NOx  emissions
in  the
plasma-assisted ammonia combustion in the similar swirl burner shows
a clear extension of the flame stable range [231,232]. Fig. 40 (a) shows
the experimental setup. The nanosecond plasma discharge was gener-
ated with a controllable high voltage generator by the two electrodes of
the center electrode and outer ring at the injector exit.

A typical plasma assisted ammonia swirl combustion is illustrated in
Figs. 40 (b) and Fig. 41 indicated by the direct photograph at different
equivalence ratios. When the plasma was not present as in Fig. 41, the
flame approaches blow-off condition at φ = 0.76, indicated by the vortex
breakdown bubble  flame. In comparison, a flame  with a strong lumi-
nosity at ISL was always anchored if the plasma as applied. As analyzed
in  the  earlier  section,  local  blow-off  behavior  could  be  due  to  1)  the

Moreover, the effect of plasma on the flow characteristics, i.e., the body
force  and  flow  fluctuations,  are  negligible  for  high-speed  flow  [233].
Therefore,  the  change  of  flame  macro  structure  extending  the  stable
flame to leaner side is only due to the application of plasma. Studies of
Ju et al. [234,235] and Sun et al. [236] further verify the behavior of
plasma on NH3/air flame enhancement in a simple swirl burner.

The effect of the voltage, the frequency and the power of the plasma
on the lean low-off limits are shown in Fig. 42 [231]. According to the
calculation of the discharge power of the plasma, the voltage inversely
proportional to the frequency. When the discharge power was fixed at
39 W (1.9 % of flame thermal power at φ  = 0.94), the lean blow-off
limits show different behaviors. At 39 W, no visible effect was seen on
extending the lean blow-off limits when V = 6 kV, f = 26 kHz. Increasing
the  voltage  to  V  = 11  kV,  f  = 7  kHz,  the  lean  blow-off  limits  was
significantly  extended  for  the  entire  air  flow  rate  range.  Comparing
these  two  cases,  the  discharge  was  corona  discharge  and  was  only
limited near the electrode rim which cannot provide further assistance
to the flame stabilization for 6 kV, f = 26 kHz. However, for 11 kV, f = 7
kHz, it was filamentary discharge which showed cyclic annular shape
reigniting  the  unburned  mixture,  resulting  in  a  pilot  flame  near  the
burner  exit.  The  lean  blow-off  limits  can  be  further  extended  when
increasing the voltage to 15 kV, f = 4 kHz even with the discharge power
of  39  W.  The  significant  extension  of  lean  blow-off  limits  by  the
discharge  voltage  demonstrates  the  kinetic  effect  of  the  plasma.
Conceivably, the extension effect on lean blow-off limits was weakened
when the discharge frequency decreases from f = 4 kHz to f = 2 kHz at V
= 15 kV since the discharge power is decreased. The experiment results
showed that the mean unburned temperature only increases by 6 K if
increasing  the  flame  thermal  power  by  39  W,  which  is  negligible  to
extend  the  flame  stable  limit.  This  demonstrates  that  the  significant
extension of the lean blow-off limits comes from the kinetic nature of the
plasma.

3.3.3. Flames at high combustion pressure

The flame is stabilized at high pressure in the combustion chamber of
GTs.  In  fact,  rich/lean  blow-off  equivalence  ratio  can  be  slightly
extended by increasing the pressure since the combustion intensity is
enhanced  at  high  pressure  and  the  flame  would  be  more  compact.
Fig. 43 shows a comparison between flame macrostructures at different
combustion pressures by Kobayashi et al. [37]. The flame photos were
taken under pressures of 0.1 MPa and 0.5 MPa at the same chamber inlet
velocity and equivalence ratio, i.e., Uin = 4.0 m/s and φ = 1.0. The in-
crease in pressure results in a shorter flame with stronger luminosity,
indicating more intense combustion [221] since the fuel consumption
and thermal power increase with pressure. Further study of the pressure
effect on ammonia swirl flames also verifies this behavior. Long expo-
sure broadband images of NH3/air flames at φ = 1.0 under pressure from
0.1 to 0.5 MPa are shown in Fig. 44 [69]. The flames clearly show that
the chemiluminescence intensity increases with the increase of pressure.

Moreover, the flame front is less recognizable at high pressure, because
of the increase of Reynolds number and the flame brush thickness.

The  blow-off  limits  measurements  of  premixed  ammonia/air  swirl
flames at different pressures are shown in Fig. 45 [237]. A clear exten-
sion in rich limits is observed with pressure increasing, which is resulted
from the hydrogen production in the ORZ. One dimensional flame re-
sults of Nakamura et al. [238] show that a considerable hydrogen vol-
ume fraction of 10 % and 8 % are seen at the flame end position for the
adiabatic and non-adiabatic laminar flames when the flame is far rich of
φ = 1.6. High concentration of H2 is produced by NH3 decomposition at
fuel  rich condition, which  is a  general  feature of the NH3/air flames.
Another  study  by  Okafor  et  al.  [111]  shows  that  in  swirl  flames  H2
production is largely depended on the competition of the flow residence
time in the combustion chamber and the time scale of the chemical re-
action  related  to  H2  production.  Comparing  to  the  flames  at  normal
pressure, the combustion is more intense and the chemical reaction time
scale is smaller at high pressure, leading to the promotion of H2  pro-
duction.  Therefore,  the  stabilization  of  the  flame  is  enhanced  by  the
increased H2  in the post flame, namely in the recirculation zone (ORZ
and IRZ). The rich stabilization limit is extended as a consequence.

Khateeb  et  al.  [221]  also  measured  the  stable  flame  limits  with
increasing pressure for NH3/CH4/air flames and NH3/H2/air flames at a
certain Reynolds numbers, shown in Fig. 46. It is readily seen that stable
region defined by the equivalence ratio of rich blow-off, flashback, and
lean blow-off are similar as pressure increasing. For the flames with high
XNH3,  both  lean  and  rich  blow-off  limits  are  slightly  extended  with
pressure.  By  surveying  the  data  in  Fig.  46(a),  the  equivalence  ratio
corresponding to the lean and rich stable limits of pure ammonia com-
bustion  are  0.96  and  1.26  at  0.1  MPa.  And  the  stable  range  of  pure
ammonia flame can be extended to 0.78–1.38 by increasing combustion
pressure from 0.1 MPa to 0.5 MPa. Similar behavior can be observed for
NH3/H2/air flames when increasing the combustion pressure, as shown
in Fig. 46 (b).

4. Combustion emissions

One of the greatest challenges of ammonia combustion is the high
NOx  emission which is mainly due to the high nitrogen content in its
molecule. According to the one-dimensional simulation in Fig. 17, large
NOx concentration is detected at the end position for lean combustion.
Therefore,  two  main  questions  on  the  high  NOx  issue  of  ammonia
combustion  are  1)  what  are  the  emission  characteristics  of  the  gas-
turbine-like  flames  (swirl  flames)  and  2)  how  can  we  reduce  it.  The
fundamental  researches  by  either  the  numerical  way  or  experimental
way can provide guidance on the operating condition of gas turbines.

air flame are shown in Fig. 17. High NO concentration is observed in the
lean conditions while large H2 is produced and huge NH3 slip is found at
rich conditions. This is also a general feature describing the emissions of
the swirl flames. The measurement of premixed NH3/air swirl flame in
the simple swirl combustors [187,190] show the same behaviors of each
species only with some discrepancy in actual values. The major emis-
sions including NO, NO2, N2O, NH3  and H2  were measured using the
Gasmet DX4000 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer with a
Portable Sampling System (PSS) at the scanning frequency of 5 Hz. The
details of the  measurements can be found in Refs. [111,186,187,190,
239]. Gasmet FTIR is an infrared spectrometer which is based on the
principle of Fourier transform of infrared light after interference. Due to
the water vapor in the exhausted gas, the system, including the sample
pump, heated filter needs to be preheated to 453 K (180
C) before the
measurement.  To  avoid  the  residual  gas,  it  needs  the  zero-point  cali-
bration  before  each  series  of  measurement  and  the  data  needs  to  be
logged for a period of time, i.e., larger than 180 s after each component

global  combustion  emissions,  the  exhausted  gas  sampling  was  taken
near  the  outlet  of  the  combustion chamber,  as  shown  in Fig.  47.  Un-
certainties for NO and N2O measurement are less than ±15 ppm and ±8
ppm. The global values of the emissions were taken as the mean value of
the collected data of the steady state.

The measured emission data for premixed swirl NH3/air flames are
shown  in  Fig.  48 [187,190].  The  variation  of  NOx  and  NH3  emission
behaves  similarly  with  the  results  obtained  from  laminar  flames  (see
Fig. 17). However, the exact value of each emission is highly influenced
by the burner geometry and the operating conditions. Large NO, of the
order of 1000 ppm, is observed at lean conditions with the peak value
found around φ = 0.9. The value of NO in Fig. 48 is much larger than
that of CH4/air flame. It is also seen that NO2 is in an order of magnitude
smaller  than  NO,  indicating  NO  is  the  main  contribution  of  NOx  for

NH3/air flames. NO is sharply decreased from φ = 0.9 to 1.1 and keeps a
lower value which is in the order of 10 ppm for φ > 1.1. The experiment
measurement on NOx again verifies that the “lean premixed combustion
(LPC)”, which may be a promising strategy for natural gas (methane), is
not  a  suitable  concept  for  ammonia  combustion.  A  large  amount  of
unburned NH3  was detected at near blow-off conditions when φ < 0.8
and rich conditions of φ > 1.05. The NH3 concentration will exceed the
upper limit (5000 ppm) of FTIR when φ is above 1.1. Due to low HRR
and the high ignition energy, the flame is largely local extinguished at φ
< 0.8 which results in the large unburned NH3. For rich flame of φ >
1.05, NH3  mainly comes from the excessive fuel. Though NH3  can be
regarded as a deoxidizer to reduce NOx in flue gas, the high value of NOx
may still be unacceptable. In addition, large volume H2 is also emitted at
rich conditions of φ > 1.05. As observed from Fig. 48, the concentrations
of NO and NH3 reach relatively small values simultaneously when φ is
around  1.05.  In  this  case  (φ  = 1.05),  in  the  gas  turbine  combustion
chamber fueled with NH3, NO and NH3 can be reduced simultaneously
by selective catalytic reduction (SCR).

The comparison NO and OH the emission characteristics of NH3/air
flame shows a correlation of those two species [240]. The instantaneous
NO/OH  was  measured  with  simultaneous  NO-/OH-PLIF  for  NH3/air
flames, which is shown Fig. 49. For the 2D profile, a clear correlation is
observed between the NO and OH concentrations. In the other words,
the local zones with high OH concentration correspond to that with high
NO concentration. This relation was proved to be linear by the LES re-
sults with finite rate chemistry method performed by Zhang et al. [187]
and  Somarathne  et  al.  [240].  This  finding  may  provide  a  potential
explanation  of  NO  production  of  the  ammonia  combustion.  Further-
more, this can be also a substitute method for illustrating the NO profile
(or NO relation with φ) by OH measurement for ammonia containing
flames, since OH concentration is much larger and OH-PLIF is a simpler
technique.

4.2. NOx  production analysis of NH3/air

As  reviewed,  the  NOx  issue  would  be  significant  for  ammonia
application in GTs due to the complex NOx  production under different
conditions. The experimental data only gives the emission behavior but
hardly provides understanding of the NOx  production. With the devel-
opment  of  chemical  mechanism  of  ammonia  in  the  past  decades,  the
analysis  on  the  pathways  of  NOx  formation  becomes  feasible,  which
gives  an  extended  understanding  of  NOx  formation  hence  provides  a
guidance for different NOx reducing strategies. Modeling NH3 oxidation
at high-temperature and low-pressure conditions has been thoroughly
investigated  and  available  in  the  literature.  However,  understanding
NH3 oxidation at low and intermediate temperatures (800–1600 K) and
elevated pressures (>0.2 MPa) has become essential for practical com-
bustion devices like engines and gas turbines. Unfortunately, emission
prediction of ammonia fuel cofired with methane or hydrogen for these
conditions  involves  complex  phenomena  that  have  not  been  fully
resolved  within  the  reaction  chemistry  community.  This  is  mainly
caused  by  the  impact  of  nitrogen  radicals  combined  with  hydrogen
radicals that closely depending on temperature and oxygen levels can
drastically change the behavior of the flame, hence the final emission
outcomes.

The pioneer work of Miller and his co-workers [241,242] provided a
detailed kinetics on ammonia oxidation. However, the model predicts
good flame structure [243,244], flame speed [43] at lean conditions but
not at rich conditions. Nevertheless, the mechanism has been used to
understand the ammonia oxidation chemistry and NO formation for the
followed researcher [245]. According to the kinetics, NH3  molecule is
firstly converted to NHi by H abstraction under large amount OH radical.
NO will be formed from NHi oxidation through HNO intermediate when
the concentration of OH radical is large. Further studies proved that NO
production is promoted when increasing the OH radical pool and vice
versa [246,247]. Therefore, one main reason for the peak NO emission

at φ = 0.9 is that OH radicals show the peak value near this equivalence
ratio. The later investigations further confirmed that the dominant fuel
NO  path  is  the  HNO  channel  [248].  Compared  to  the  lean  ammonia
combustion, concentration of OH radical is much smaller for the rich
condition,  which  may  lead  to  the  low  NO  emission.  In  addition,  H2
production is largely promoted from the NHi oxidation by the relatively
large H radical in the O/H radical pool. However, other studies proposed
the  potential  NNH  pathway  on  NO  production  [249].  A  detailed
pathway analysis of a planar premixed NH3/air flame in both lean (φ =
0.94)  and  rich  conditions  (φ  = 1.08)  is  shown  in  Fig.  50 [181].  The
arrow thickness in the figure corresponds to the magnitude of the rate of
species production from reaction k integrated over the whole length of
the computational domain. From the kinetic analysis in Fig. 50 [181],
NO is largely influenced by the reactions shown below.

N + NO ⇔ N2 + O                                                                       (R1)

At rich condition as shown in Fig. 50 (b), the other reactions, such as

NH2 + NH ⇔ N2H2 + H                                                               (R9)

Also became important instead of the reactions of (R2) and (R5). In
lean conditions, red arrows represent the key reactions of (R1) – (R8).
HNO production through reactions (R2), (R3), and (R5) is essential for
NO production for ammonia combustion. Reactions from NO to N2 are
the main pathways of NO reduction which can be concluded as (R4) and
(R6) - (R8). In the rich condition as shown in Fig. 50 (b), reactions with
sensitive to NO, NH3, both NO and NH3 are highlighted by the red, green
and blue arrows. It is suggested that an update of the rate constants of
these reactions is necessary to improve the accuracy of the prediction of
NO and unburnt NH3.

Similar results were obtained by Mei et al. [138] who compared the
chemical pathway of lean (φ = 0.7) and rich (φ = 1.5) condition with air
(O2:N2 = 21:79) and oxygen enrichment (O2:N2 = 45:55) at 298 K and 1
atm.  The  analysis  on  the  production  rate  of  each  species  is  shown  in

conditions. It can be observed that the total contribution of OH and H on
NH2 - > NH and NH - > HNO is much smaller for the rich condition. This
further explains the lower NO in fuel rich NH3/air flames in Fig. 48.

4.3. Emissions of ammonia combustion cofired with small active molecule
fuels

Due to the poor performance of ammonia combustion, especially for
flame stabilization, co-firing NH3 with small molecule fuels with higher
reactivity such as CH4 or H2 would be one of the potential solutions. On
the one hand, CH4 and H2 addition can clearly enhance the combustion
intensity and extends stable region, as indicated in earlier sections. On
the other hand, the co-firing NH3/CH4  (NH3/hydrocarbons) fuels pro-
vide a solution in the transition phase from fossil fuels to renewable fuels
for decarbonization. Moreover, co-firing NH3 with H2 is an ideal strategy
to realize “zero-carbon” economy since H2 is also carbon free and can be
easily  obtained  by  partially  cracking  NH3.  There  are  numerous  in-
vestigations on this topic in recent years worldwide [16,36,37,111,186,
187,193–195,240,250,251].  This  section  reviews  the  emission  perfor-
mance of co-firing NH3/CH4/air, NH3/H2/air flames.

With the increasing chemical kinetics mechanism of ammonia con-
tained fuel developed [138,164,245,252–260] in the past decades, the
emission characteristics can be firstly demonstrated by 0D or 1D simu-
lations. Xiao et al. [261] investigated the NO, CO2 and CO emissions in
the exhaust gas of co-firing NH3/CH4/air flames over a wide range of
equivalence  ratios  and  ammonia  fractions  with  1D  simulation  by  the
premixed  combustion  code  of  Cantera  [262].  The  simulation  was
coupled with a detailed chemical-kinetics mechanism which was mostly
based on mechanism developed by Konnov et al. [260]. The mechanism
mainly  improved  the  performance  of  ignition  delay  time  through  the
modification of key reactions: NH2  + NH2  = NH3  + NH and NO + H
(+M) = HNO(+M). The calculation results [261] are shown in Fig. 52.
The analysis on the combustion of ammonia containing fuels shows that
it  not  only  produces  high  temperature  and  Zeldovich  NOx,  but  also
produces  fuel  bound  emissions  due  to  the  inherent  characteristics  of
ammonia. Fig. 52 (a) shows the variation of NO concentration with φ
under  different  NH3  mole  fraction  (XNH3).  It  can  be  viewed  that  the
general behavior is preserved for each XNH3, with large NO observed at
lean condition showing the peak at φ ≈ 0.9. The NO emission exhibits a
nonlinear  behavior  with  XNH3  from  0  to  1.0  as  shown  in  Fig.  52 (b).
Moreover, NO emission of the co-firing flame is much larger than that of
pure NH3/air flame and CH4/air flame, which is probably due to pro-
motion of the pathway of NO production. It is clear that the maximum
NO is reached around XNH3 = 0.5 for φ = 0.6 and 1.0. Fig. 52 (c) and (d)
show  the  concentration  of  main  carbon  products  in  exhaust  gas  with
XNH3  for φ = 0.6, 1.0 and 1.2. In Fig. 52 (c), as expected, as the XNH3
increases,  CO2  emission  decreases  accordingly  because  there  is  less
carbon  available  in  the  fuel.  It  can  also  be  seen  that  there  are  more
carbon  dioxide  products  under  stoichiometric  conditions  than  under
lean and rich fuel conditions. This is mainly resulted from the higher
combustion efficiency. Fig. 52 (d) shows the CO emission which tends to
increase  with  φ.  The  contradiction  between  NOx  and  CO  emission
reduction  shows  that  the  operating  condition  needs  to  be  carefully
designed when using NH3/CH4 cofiring fuels.

4.3.1. Ammonia/methane co-cofiring flames

The experimental studies on the emissions of ammonia combustion
in  the  lab-scale  burner  or  model  combustor  demonstrated  the  same
behavior as the 1D simulation. Experimental measurements show that
adding a very small amount of hydrogen leads to a considerable increase
of NO. J ́ojka et al. [263] investigated the NO emission in an axisym-
metric  burner  with  inner  diameter  of  25  mm,  which  was  placed  in  a
combustion chamber with an approximate adiabatic environment. The
unburned mixture velocity of 40 m/s with the temperature of 573 K was
supplied to the burner, which is close to the gas turbine conditions. The
measured NO with φ is plotted in Fig. 53 at the NH3 mole fraction in the

fuel up to 5 %. NO is about 50 ppmv@0%O2 and nearly keeps the same
level within 0.6 < φ < 1.0 for CH4/air flames. However, a clear increase
(800 pmmv) of NO concentration is observed when adding only 1 % NH3

by volume in the fuel. Moreover, the value of NO emission is doubled
with  XNH3  increasing  from  1  %  to  2.5  %.  The  small  amount  of  NH3
addition in CH4/air flames would result in large NO emission which is

highly nonlinear.

Further studies [111] with larger amount in the fuel also support the
nonlinear  behavior  of  the  emission  characteristics.  The  combustion
chamber should provide a consistent thermal power when using alter-
native  fuels.  Therefore,  another  definition  of  ammonia  ratio  of
CH4/NH3/air swirl flame is heat fraction ENH3  in a model gas turbine
combustion chamber. ENH3 is defended as

ENH3 =

xNH3LHVNH3
xNH3LHVNH3 + xCH4LHVCH4

.

(5)

In  the  above  equation,  XNH3  (XCH4)  and  LHVNH3  (LHVCH4)  represent
mole  fraction  of  NH3  (CH4)  in  the  binary  fuel  and  the  lower  heating
value of NH3 (CH4). Their research [111] was motivated based on a 50
kW micro gas turbine used by Kurata et al. [107,109]. By this procedure,
the  power of  the gas  turbine is  preserved by partly  replacing CH4  by
NH3. The structure of the combustion chamber and the swirl geometry is
shown in Fig. 26. The laser diagnostic techniques, such as particle image
velocimetry  (PIV),  planar  laser-induced  fluorescence  (PLIF)  imaging,
and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer to study the flame
structure, emission profile and global emission, respectively. Fig. 54 (a)
shows simultaneous imaging of OH-PLIF and NO-PLIF in non-premixed
flame at fuel rich condition of φ = 1.4. The result also verified that the
local  region  with  relatively  high  OH-PLIF  intensity  in  fuel  rich  flame
corresponds  to  the  region  with  relatively  high  NO-PLIF  intensity  for
ammonia  containing  flames,  since  an  important  contribution  to  NO
production comes from the OH radicals.

Due  to  the  correlation  of  OH  and  NO,  the  plane-integrated  time-
averaged  OH-PLIF  intensities  Iave  with  equivalence  ratios,  which  is
defined below, may represent the general behavior of NO for ammonia
containing flames.

where IOH is the local OH intensity, A represents the integral area and N
is the total number of the averaged images. Fig. 54 (b) shows the vari-
ation of Iave with equivalence ratios obtained from 400 single shots for
both premixed and non-premixed flames. The behavior of Iave  for the
premixed flame shows a clear increasing trend at lean conditions and
then present a decreasing trend, with the maximum value at φ  = 0.9.
However, in comparison, the non-premixed flame has higher OH-PLIF
intensities at φ < 0.7.

Fig. 55 shows the main emissions for the single stage (without sec-
ondary air) flame for both premixed type and non-premixed type. It can
be found that CH4/NH3/air premixed flame releases approximately 50

times more NO than CH4/air premixed flame, with the NO values greater
than 5000 ppmv (beyond the measurement range of FTIR) as shown in
the figure. Even for flames at ENH3 = 0.3 (XNH3 ≈ 0.5), NO is in the same
order with the results in Fig. 53 in which XNH3 is smaller than 5 %. This
further  verified  that  the  nonlinear  nature  of  NO  emission  for  the  co-
firing  CH4/NH3/air  flames.  Comparing  with  NO2,  we  can  conclude
that  NO  is  the  main  component  of  NOx  and  the  difference  in  NO  is
negligible among each ammonia heat fraction ratio ENH3. Moreover, NO
emission of CH4/NH3/air flames are at least twice larger than that of
NH3/air flames within the tested equivalence ratio 0.6 < φ < 1.4 [188].
NO2  was detected in the lean conditions with the peak value (around
120 ppmv) at about φ  = 0.8. The largest N2O of 120 ppmv is seen at
ENH3  = 0.3 and φ = 0.6. N2O decreases significantly with equivalence
ratio, which goes below 10 ppmv when φ  > 0.8. The NOx  behavior is
similar for non-premixed flames compared with that of the CH4/NH3/air
premixed  flames.  However,  the  values  of  NO  and  NO2  emissions  for
non-premixed  flames  is  much  smaller  than  that  of  premixed  flames.
Fig. 55 (b) shows the emissions of NH3, HCN and H2. The unburned NH3
increases very sharply at fuel rich conditions and reaches the order of
thousand ppmv at φ = 1.3 for premixed flames due to the excessive fuel.
In comparison, NH3 emission will exceed thousand ppmv at φ = 1.15 for
non-premixed flames, which may be caused by insufficient mixing of the
fuel and air. The variation of intermediate species HCN with φ for each
ENH3 is very alike with NH3 emission. H2 was also detected and increases
rapidly when φ > 1.0. The volume fraction of H2 in the exhaust gas is so
large such that the H2 emission cannot be neglected for the gas turbines.
In the ammonia containing flames, NO is mostly produced through
the fuel NOx path caused by the oxidation of NHi. The pathway for NO
production is largely contributed from the concentration of O, H and OH
radicals. N2O is mainly produced by the reaction of NO with NH and
HO2 [264]. Then, N2O is consumed rapidly mainly by the reaction with
H radical and thermal decomposition. Therefore, low temperature and
low concentration of H radical are the typical conditions of extremely
poor  equivalence  ratio,  which  may  hinder  the  consumption  of  N2O,
resulting in a large amount of N2O emission observed in the experiment.
At lean fuel conditions, a large number of O and OH radicals contribute
to  the  rapid  consumption  of  HCN,  and  finally  produce  NHi  radicals,
followed by NO. However, under fuel rich conditions, the relatively low
concentration of O and OH radicals will hinder HCN oxidation, resulting
in the high HCN emission observed in the experiment.

As  discussed  above,  ammonia  combustion  emits  much  larger  NOx
than that of methane, while NO will increase for the co-firing NH3/CH4/
air flames illustrated strong nonlinear trend with XNH3. Further experi-
mental  measurements  [186]  show  that  the  NOx  emission  of  co-firing
NH3/CH4/air  swirl  flames  exhibits  a  peak  value  at  XNH3  ≈ 0.5  when
ammonia mole fraction ratio ranging from 0 to 1.0, which is shown in

Fig. 56 (a). Generally, almost no visible NOx emission is seen at XNH3 =
0.  In  the  other  words,  CH4/air  flame  emits  nearly  zero  NO  emission
compared  with  the  co-firing  NH3/CH4/air  flames.  As  indicated  in
Fig. 53, the increase is significant when the fuel contains only a small
amount  of  ammonia.  The  general  behavior  of  NOx  by  XNH3  can  be
observed when surveying the cases as XNH3  goes from 0 to 1.0. Within
the tested experimental range of 0.6 < φ  < 1.2, NOx  emission will be
largely increased by adding NH3 into the fuel when XNH3 is below 50 %.
However,  further  increasing  XNH3,  NOx  emission  demonstrates  a
decreasing trend. Comparing with the pure NH3/air flame, the equiva-
lence  ratio  corresponding  to  the  peak  NOx  emission  shifts  to  larger
values for the co-firing flames. This behavior was also verified by Kha-
teeb et al. [195] as shown in Fig. 56(b).

Further  explanations  can  be  made  by  the  LES  results  [239]  of
NH3/CH4/air co-firing swirl flames. The NO formation in a swirl flame
for at different NH3 fraction can be demonstrated by the instantaneous
NO  profile  with  the  velocity  indicated  by  streamlines  as  shown  in
Fig. 57. A very small value of 104 ppm is found in the LES at the chamber
outlet for the case of XNH3  = 0 (pure CH4). In Fig. 57 (a), NO concen-
tration  was  multiplied  by  20  to  compare  with  other  conditions  in  a
uniform colorbar. The results indicate that NO is mainly concentrated in
the inner recirculation zone in the combustion chamber. As shown in
earlier section, NO increases significantly after adding a small amount of
ammonia. For example, NO will be 4351 ppm in LES by increasing XNH3
to 20 %. It is also found that the emission of NO seems to reach its peak
value  when  40  %  < XNH3< 60  %.  The  analysis  of  reactions  in  IRZ
(temperature T = 2100 K) can further explain this nonlinear behavior
[239].  The  NO  chemical  pathway  and  variations  of  key  species  mass
fraction with ammonia fraction are shown in Fig. 58 (a). In this case, NO
is largely contributed by the HNO pathway which can be promoted by
the  intermediate  species  i.e.,  HNO,  H,  OH  and  O2.  To  compare  the
contribution of these intermediate species, Fig. 58 (b) shows the varia-
tion of mass fraction of each species with ammonia fraction, which was
obtained as the space and time-averaged emission (STAE) method from
LES.  The  figure  shows  that  H,  OH  and  O2  concentration  exhibits  a
decreasing  behavior  while  HNO  shows  an  increasing  trend  with
ammonia  fraction  XNH3  increasing.  In  the  case  of  XNH3  = 0,  NO  is
extremely low since no HNO radical was seen even through there are
large amount of H, O and O2. With the increasing of NH3 ratio, though
HNO shows an increasing trend, the H, O and O2  decrease, resulting a
nonlinear NO formation behavior with the peak value at 40 % < XNH3<
60 %.

4.3.2. Ammonia/hydrogen co-firing flames

Compared with co-firing NH3/CH4/air flames, hydrogen addition to
NH3/air flames provides another potential strategy for ammonia utili-
zation, as indicated by researches on flame stabilization [187,221]. The

main reasons are 1) hydrogen can be directly obtained in the ammonia
combustion system by cracking NH3 without a second fuel input; 2) the
reactivity of NH3  is too low and the combustion may be too weak. In
contrast, hydrogen is a good compensation due to its high reactivity; 3)
hydrogen  is  also  carbon-free  which  will  not  introduce  CO2  as  well.
Therefore, the combustion system fueled with NH3/H2 is ideal to realize
“zero-carbon” economy. Nevertheless, the NOx emission issue still exists
for the co-firing NH3/H2/air flames and the investigation on emission
characteristics is still ongoing [219,265–267].

Zhu  et  al.  [250]  studied  the  emission  characteristics  of  premixed
NH3/H2/air  flames  under  extremely  lean  combustion  conditions  by
detecting  the  chemiluminescence  signature  based  on  the  laser  tech-
niques [266,268]. The experiments were carried out in an atmospheric
laboratory  scale  swirl  combustor,  which  is  shown  in  Fig.  59 (a).  The
influence of equivalence ratio φ and ammonia fuel fraction XNH3  on of
OH  × chemiluminescence  characteristics  were  indicated  by  the
time-average Abel-deconvoluted images, which is shown Fig. 59 (b). For
quantitative  comparison,  all  the  images  were  normalized  with  the
maximum intensity of the OH × chemiluminescence at XNH3 = 0.90 and
φ = 1.00. The macro structure of the flames can be clearly observed by
the OH × images, which shows a similar V shape. The normalized OH*
chemiluminescence intensity is largely decreased with decreasing in φ
and increasing the XNH3, since the OH concentration is decreased. The
NO emission at was measured with a Horiba VA-3022 dual CLD analyzer
connected to a Horiba VS-E(cid:0) 3005 sampling conditioning unit. Low NO
emission was detected for φ = 0.4 which is about 100 ppm at XNH3  =
0.50 as shown in Fig. 60. The results may support the “premixed lean
combustion”  concept for the co-firing NH3/H2/air flames. In compari-
son, the largest value is found to be 4900 ppm for φ = 0.85 and XNH3 =
0.90.  A  clear  decrease  in  NO  is  observed  at  0.65  <φ  < 1.00  when
increasing XNH3. The radial NO profile was measured at three heights
from  the  burner  exit,  i.e.,  P1~P3  indicated  in  Fig.  59 (a).  By  further
analyzing the radial NO profile, they found that NO is mainly produced
near the flame root. Furthermore, the peak value of NO production is
found inside the inner recirculation zone. At further downstream, the
NO profile is widened with a decreasing peak value. They also found that
the chemiluminescence intensity of OH can be used as a substitute for
the mole fraction of NO.

The  study  on  the  emission  characteristics  was  also  conducted  by
other researchers in the modal gas-turbine combustors [187,194,267].
An attempt was made by Khateeb et al. [194] using the H2  from NH3
cracking to boost chemical reactivity. They compared the NO emission
characters of NH3/H2/air flames and NH3/H2/N2/air flames, as shown
in Fig. 61, with H2:N2 = 1:3 following the atom proportion in ammonia
molecule. It is readily seen that nitrogen dilution results in slightly better
NO  performance  when  φ  < 1.0.  For  φ  = 0.85  and  XNH3  = 0.80,  NO
decreases  from 3400  ppm  to  3000  ppm  when  nitrogen  is  introduced.

These  results  demonstrate  that  in  the  combustion  system  partially
cracking  ammonia  into  hydrogen-nitrogen  may  provide  a  potential
strategy to improve NO performance.

To compare the effects of hydrogen and methane addition on NOx
emissions, Zhang et al. [187] investigated the flame stabilization and the
emission characteristics of NH3/CH4/air and NH3/H2/air with very high
NH3  mole fraction XNH3  which is up to 90 %. The model combustor is
shown in Fig. 20 (b). Fig. 62 (a) shows the global NO emission behavior
of  NH3/CH4/air  and  NH3/H2/air  flames,  with  the  comparison  of
NH3/air  flames.  Fig.  62 (a)  plots  the  corresponding  plane-integrated
time-averaged OH-PLIF intensity defined in Eq. (3), further indicating
NO production was not altered when 10 % H2 is added to the fuel. It can
be  observed  that  the  NO  emission  behavior  of  the  NH3/10%H2/air
flames are similar to that of the NH3/air flames, which is better than that
of NH3/CH4/air flame. It can be readily seen that at fuel rich condition
(φ > 1.05) NO concentration is very low (~100 ppmv) for the NH3/air
flames, NH3/10%CH4/air flames and NH3/10%H2/air flames. 10 % H2
addition into the fuel might be a NO friendly operating condition for
ammonia fueled gas turbines.

4.4. Combustion reaction network analysis

Based on the numerous kinetic mechanisms for ammonia combus-
tion, one can evaluate the emissions level of combustion chambers with
combustion  reaction  network  (CRN)  simulation.  Zhang  et  al.  [186]
carried out the CRN simulations of co-firing NH3/CH4/air swirl flames
based on their experimental results and tried to clear the key reaction

path on NO production. A secondary CRN which considers the secondary
air was developed based on the work of Pedersen et al. [269]. By this
procedure, the inner, outer recirculation zones or the post flame zone
can be  simplified  to the  0D or  1D  reactor, i.e.,  plugged  flow reactors
(PFRs). Therefore, the combustion chamber with a swirl combustor can
be modeled as the network connection. Fig. 63(a) shows the simplifi-
cation of a gas turbine model combustor [239]. The recirculation zones
and the post flame zone can be represented by three PSRs with IRZ, ORZ
with the specific connections of each reactor. The inputs and outputs for
each reactor were decided by the residence time which is evaluated from
the  modeled  combustor.  Therefore,  the  emission  characteristics  ob-
tained  from  CRN  can  be  used  to  predict  the  emission  behavior  and
analyze the production mechanisms for experiments. Fig. 63(b) shows
the  NOx  variations with  ammonia fractions obtained  by  experimental
measurement and the three-element CRN calculation. It is clear that the
CRN  calculation  results  capture  the  experimental  behavior  of  NOX
emission for lean, rich and stoichiometric conditions. It can be analyzed
that an increasing contribution from HNO pathway is observed for lean
and  stoichiometric  conditions.  In  comparison,  for  rich  condition,  the
formation of NOx is mainly attributed to the NHi pathway.

As discussed above, if done correctly, CRN shows a good capability
capturing  the  NOx  performance  at  normal  pressure  and  temperature.
However, resorting to this NOx prediction at high pressures implies that
the  mechanisms  need  to  be  verified  with  high  pressure  data  such  as
laminar flame speed, ignition delay times and emissions. Nevertheless,
CRN with the current mechanisms still provide solutions to identify GT
operating  conditions  yielding  good  NOx  performance  Li  et  al.  [270]

emission when XNH3 is above 50 %. These results would provide a basic
operating condition solution for the ammonia fueled gas turbines.

4.5. Effects of staged combustion

High NOx emission has been a major issue since ammonia was pro-
posed as a fuel, which was also highlighted as the main challenge by the
recent  reviews  on  ammonia  combustion  [12,14,16,36,37,39,72,124].
Based on the NOx  production pathway, the local OH, O and H radicals
are  critical  to  control  the  NOx  emission.  Kobayashi  et  al.  [37]  listed
several  studies  demonstrating  that  this  issue  can  be  mitigated  by
applying staged combustion strategy, which burns ammonia at low NOx
condition in the main combustion zone and further reduces NOx  with
reaction  at  secondary  zone.  Besides  the  pure  ammonia  combustion
[188], this is also true for ammonia-methane and ammonia-hydrogen
fuel  blends  [111].  Therefore,  there  are  increasing  number  of  in-
vestigations on two-stage combustion, referred  to as rich-quench-lean
(RQL)  technology,  for  ammonia  fueled  gas  turbine  combustors.
Different combustor geometries have been examined at atmospheric or
elevated pressure and it is widely proved that adjusting local equiva-
lence ratio is one effective way to control NOx [111,188,240,273–278].
Supplying air at multiple locations along streamwise, which is also
mentioned as staged air, is the major strategy for the staged combustion.
Investigations  of Okafor et  al.  [111,188] show that the  secondary air
injection  (mentioned  as  two-stage  combustion  in  their  studies)  can
reduce the NOx emission by applying the rich-lean combustion strategy.
Fig. 65 shows numerical results of the influence of secondary air injec-
tion on the instantaneous NO species distribution with primary zone and
overall  equivalence  ratios  for  premixed  swirl  NH3/air  flames.  By
surveying the simulated NO and temperature distributions [187], it can
be concluded that temperature seems to play a minor role in the NOx
formation  for  ammonia  fuel,  which  is  distinct  with  the  thermal  NOx.
Fig.  65 also  indicates  that  the  NO  production  can  be  significantly
reduced by applying the proper fuel air organization with the two-stage
combustion. In their simulation at Φprimary = 0.8, large NO is produced
in the primary zone and large NO is transported near the chamber outlet
where  combustion  is  not  occurred  since  the  fuel  is  insufficiently  sup-
plied. In this case, the influence of the secondary air on NO is limited.
However,  low  NO  concentration  is  observed  when  increasing  the
Φprimary to richer condition. At Φprimary = 1.2 (Φoverall = 0.37), the global
NO  emission  at  chamber  outlet  (272  ppmv)  reaches  the  lowest  value
even though large NO is observed in the ORZ with 552 ppmv at z = 75
mm. When going to further rich of Φoverall = 1.4, the global NO emission
rises  again  in  spite  of  low  NO  concentration  in  primary  zone.  In  this
condition, large NH3  is slipped and transported downstream which is
consumed in the secondary zone, resulting in NO formation. In addition,
the combustion of H2, emitted in the fuel rich condition, produces the

developed  a  multistage  CRN  model  to  investigate  the  NOx  emission
behavior and the production mechanism in the operating conditions of
state-of-the-art H/J class heavy duty gas turbines [271,272] fueled with
NH3/CH4. The ambient pressure for the combustion was as high as 2.3
MPa and the temperature before the first-stage turbine was in the range
from 1773 to 1873 K. In their CRN, 3 m s and 20 m s were adopted as the
residence time of PSR and PFR based on the operating condition of the
heavy-duty gas turbines. The NOx  formation rates with ammonia frac-
tion from different pathways are plotted in Fig. 64. In the main com-
bustion zone, which is indicated as the perfect stirred reactor (PSR) and
shown in Fig. 64 (a), the contribution of the thermal NOx is going to be
smaller  with  XNH3  even  though  the  absolute  amount  of  thermal  NOx
increases.  When  XNH3  is  increased,  the  NO  production  from  HNO
pathway becomes dominant. The consumption of NO by NHi  and N2O
pathways  are  also  promoted,  resulting  in  a  nearly  constant  net  NO

observe  a  minimal  value  of  NO  emission  with  near  zero  NH3  slip,  as
shown in Fig. 64 (b). The optimum low-NOx  Φprimary  was found to be
1.10 as shown in Fig. 66. They found that 42 ppmv with 99.5 % com-
bustion efficiency can be achieved in the thermal power of 31.44 kW at
0.3  MPa  within  Φoverall  = 0.40  to  0.67.  This  rich-lean  combustion
strategy was also verified valid for the NH3/CH4/air co-firing flames in
the same combustor by the author, however, with the optimum Φprimary
moves to richer side [111].

Compared with the staged air in the combustion chamber, another
effective way to improve the NOx  emissions is the fuel staged strategy
[279,280]. A recent work conducted by Lee et al. [280] suggests that
NOx can be reduced by 80 % with only 8 % of the bypassed ammonia as
shown  in  Fig.  67 (b).  Fig.  67 (a)  shows  the  tangential  injection
combustor with the secondary fuel injection. The secondary ammonia
was controlled and injected at post flame of the primary zone to adjust
the temperature at the secondary zone. They concluded that controlling
ammonia bypass ratio in this fuel staging tangential injection combustor
is pivotal to maximize the NO reduction rate. The possible explanations
are that thermal DeNOx process will play an important role in mitigating

In their experiments, they obtained the typical emission character-
istics for the single staged combustion as shows in Fig. 64 (a), with NO

NO emissions when the exit temperature of the primary region is close to
the  threshold  for  active  NO  reduction.  Those  experimental  results  of
secondary fuel injection on mitigating NO emissions were also verified
by the simulation at laminar case [281], illustrating an approximately
28 % NO emissions reduction. By chemical analysis, it is found that the
pathway of NO reacting with NH2  was enhanced in the region down-
stream of the secondary injection region [252]. With the NO chemical,
NH3  is  mainly  converted  to  N2  through  the  NH3→NH2→NNH→N2
pathway. Further study of Vijrumbana et al. [282] with CRN analysis
also indicates that fuel staging of NH3/CH4/air flames reduces the CO,
NOx, and  unburned NH3  emissions. Therefore, the staged combustion
strategy, both staged air and fuel, can be considered as an alternative
approach for emission reduction of ammonia combustion.

4.6. Effects of combustion pressure

The  thermal  power  can  be  effectively  improved  by  enhancing  the
combustion pressure. Usually, combustion pressure is elevated to serval
megapascal about 2.0 MPa in the state-of-the-art H/J class heavy duty
GT.  Increasing  the  pressure  may  change  the  rate  constant  of  the  key
reaction  pathways  or  chemical  time  scale  as  well  as  the  combustion
residence  time  in  the  chamber.  Therefore,  pressure  exhibits  a  non-
negligeable effect on ammonia combustion [283]. The numerical work
of Somarathne et al. [284,285] provides a basic understanding of the
influence  of  combustion  pressure  on  the  emission  performance  of
NH3/air flames. Fig. 68 shows NO distribution of φ = 1.0 and 1.25 at
different pressures, i.e., P = 0.1 MPa and 0.5 MPa. For both flames in the
figure,  a  considerable  decrease  in  NO  emission  is  observed  when  the

ambient pressure is increased. For φ = 1.0 at 0.5 MPa, even though the
NO production area is larger and NO is also produced in ORZ, the local
NO mole fraction is smaller at P0 = 0.5 MPa. For φ = 1.25, NO is only
produced  near  the  flame  front. Both  the  NO  production  area  and  the
local NO mole fraction are smaller at high pressure. The space and time
averaged emission (STAE) from the numerical result show that the STAE
of NO at P0 = 0.5 MPa is nearly half that of 0.1 MPa. The studies of Miller
et al. [242] demonstrate that OH radicals play an important role when
amidogen  (NH2)  is  oxidized  to  NO  through  nitroxyl  (HNO)  in  the
reaction.

NH2 + O ≤> HNO + H                                                                 (R1)

The OH reduction reaction with the third body of OH + H + M ≤>
H2O + M is highly sensitive to the combustion pressure and would be
promoted  as  pressure  increasing.  Therefore,  NO  production  is  sup-
pressed due to the OH radical concentration decreasing at high pressure.
Moreover, the experimental results from Okafor et al. [237] show that
the OH-PLIF intensity is decreased as the pressure increases as shown in
Fig.  69.  This  is  also  indicated  with  the  decreasing  OH  chem-
iluminescence  of  the  61%NH3/39%CH4/air  flames  at  0.2  MPa  within
0.80 < φ < 1.42 in the study of Valera-Medina et al. [193]. In addition,
the analysis of the reaction path by Colson et al. [18] showed that the
reaction  rate  of  sub-paths  of  NH2  (NH)  => HNO  => NO  is  largely
decreased as the pressure increases.

Further studies by Khateeb et al. [221] on the NO emission verified
the pressure effect on the NO emission. Fig. 70 demonstrates the pres-
sure effect the global NO emission for NH3/H2/air flames at XNH3 = 0.90
and NH3/CH4/air flames at XNH3 = 0.80 in the constant bulk velocity at
lean and rich flames, respectively. It is clear that the NO decreases with
the pressure. And this behavior is more significant when the flame was
operated near the stoichiometric ratio. This can be explained that the
higher pressure decreases the OH radical pool, which suppresses the NO
production as a consequence. For example, the NO is about 3000 ppm at
φ = 0.9 and 0.1 MPa and the value goes to half at 0.4 MPa. According to
Fig.  70,  the  allowable  operated  equivalence  ratio  under  which  NO  is
acceptable depends on the pressure. For instance, in Fig. 70 (b), if 100
ppm is set as the acceptable value, then the flame should be operated at
φ > 1.25 when the pressure is above 0.35 MPa. In comparison, φ must be
larger than 1.30 at 0.25 MPa. The numerical results by Somarathne et al.
[285] indicates the NO is as low as 144 ppm NH3/air flames for φ > 1.25

and 0.5 MPa.

The pressure effects are also clear at staged combustion. Okafor et al.
[188]  also  investigated  the  pressure  effect  on the  global  emissions  of
premixed  and  non-premixed  swirl  flames  in  macro  gas  turbine
combustor as shown in Fig. 26. The variation of NOx  and NH3  in the
exhaust with overall equivalence ratio Φoverall is shown in Fig. 71 under
different pressure. There is no visible pressure effect on NOx emission for
the  non-premixed  flame.  While  the  NOx  concentration  is  largely
decreased when the pressure is increased from 0.1 to 0.2 MPa for pre-
mixed flame. In studies on a more practical combustion chamber, we can
also observe a clear decrease in NOx of NH3/CH4/air staged combustion
[274,286]. It is not clear how far down can the pressure positively affect
the  NOx  reduction,  as  did  the  kinetic  studies  of  Duynslaegher  et  al.
[287]. The reduction in NO formation with pressure has been attributed
to the promotion of three-body reactions involving H/O, OH radicals,
resulting in a reduction of their concentrations, and in turns the pro-
duction of NO.

4.7. Effects of combustion temperature

In  GTs,  air  temperature  is  increased  after  air  went  through  the
compressor. Air temperature might be increased from 298 K to 770 K
according  to  the  power  load,  which  would  also  show  impacts  on  the
combustion characteristics. The results from a non-premixed micro gas
turbine  combustors  show  that  increasing  chamber  inlet  temperature
(CIT) largely enhances the combustion efficiency while worsening the
◦
NOx emissions, as shown in Fig. 72. For the injection angle of 45
, as CIT
increasing from 298 K to 500 K, it is clear that NH3  slip becomes near
invisible  implying  a  higher  percentage  of  ammonia  consumption.
However, NO and NO2  exhibit a general increasing behavior. For the
◦
0
injector, the flame is unstable at CIT of 298 K, resulting in very large
unburned ammonia beyond 5000 ppmv. With an increase in CIT to 500
K  however,  stable  ammonia  combustion  was  recorded.  This  indicates
increasing CIT can enhance the flame stabilization. By increasing com-
bustion  temperature,  the  reactivity  of  NH3  molecule  is  enhanced,
increasing local key radicals and improving the combustion efficiency as
a consequence. However, NO production rate from the major fuel NO
producing reactions is promoted at higher temperatures. Also, the rate of
NO reduction by NH2 through NH2 + NO = NNH + OH and NH2 + NO =
N2 + H2O is hindered when the combustion temperature is increased.

In GTs, air temperature at chamber inlet is a variable dependent on
the engine load, strongly coupled with combustion pressure. Therefore,
firstly, the effects of air temperature on flame characteristics as well as
on NOx  emissions should be fully investigated.  Secondly, the coupled
effects of pressure and temperature on the combustion behavior based
on GT operation is also essential orienting chamber design. However,
the work focusing on this area is limited in the literature so far.

4.8. Effects of heat loss

Though  a  large  number  of  studies  on  ammonia  swirl  combustion
have been carried out so far, the researches on flame stabilization and
combustion emissions still needs further investigations. Practically, the
flame is confined within the combustion chamber resulting in a strong
flame-wall interaction (FWI), especially for ammonia combustion due to
its  low  flame  speed  and  high  NOx  emission  nature.  The  flame-wall
interaction mainly includes: 1) the physical effect (flow field, stretch-
ing, transport and diffusion) [288,289]. The recirculation zone (RZ) and
shear layer (SL) will be formed due to the existence of the chamber wall,
which provides the stabilization effect; 2) the chemical effect or thermal
effect (the change of local temperature and chemical reaction pathways
caused by heat loss) [290]. There will be a strong wall cooling on the
practical combustion chamber by the bypass air to reduce the chamber
thermal stress. For ammonia combustion, the convection heat loss might
be non-negligible, due to the lower heat release and high sensitivity to
combustion  temperature.  This  effect  may  result  in  a  much  thicker
thermal boundary and a much larger quenching distance [104,145]. As
a  consequence,  the  wall  heat  loss  affects  the  reaction  rate  of  fuel

consumption  and  the  chemical  pathway  on  emission  production.
Research shows that there is apparently larger effect of radiation heat
loss on laminar flame speed for NH3/air flame, compared with CH4/air
flame [238].

4.8.1. Heat loss on laminar premixed flame

One important research issue is: how much the heat loss affecting the
ammonia combustion since the flame is so “weak”? This issue has not
received much attention until some researches were conducted. Naka-
mura et al. [238] numerically examined the radiative heat loss effect on
the laminar flame speed of NH3/air and CH4/air flame, by comparing
the numerical results with the experimental data. For NH3/air flame, the
laminar flame speed SL is largely affected by the radiative heat loss and
decreases more than 3 % even at the stoichiometric condition compared
with the adiabatic value. The difference becomes larger as the equiva-
lence ratio deviates from stoichiometric condition, which is shown in
Fig. 73. Up to now, it is still hard to achieve satisfied agreements be-
tween  numerical  radiative  value  and  experimental  data,  especially  at
rich condition, because of the uncertainties of the heat loss for different
experimental facility, i.e., planar flames in the cylindrical tube [139],
outwardly propagating flames in the constant volume vessel [128,130,
131] and in the heat flux configuration [136] and stagnation flow [181,
291]. For CH4/air flame, in comparison, adiabatic flame speeds match
the radiative value. Both agree well with experimental data except the
conditions near the lean and rich flammability limits.

Fig. 74 (a) shows the degree of heat loss effect on SL indicated by the
relative  difference  between  adiabatic  and  radiative  SL  values.  Even
though a larger effect for NH3/air flame is observed by comparing the
two curves, however, it should be noted that the absolute quantity of
heat loss to the wall is not necessarily larger for NH3/air flame than that
of CH4/air flame. The low flame speed, which is significantly influenced
by heat loss, is one of the main reasons resulting in the poor stabiliza-
tion. This suggests that the heat loss may exhibit a non-negligible effect
on the stable operating conditions in gas turbines. Fig. 74 (b) shows the
effect  of  radiative  heat  loss  on  the  NO  and  NH3  mole  fraction  with
equivalence ratio. A clear influence of heat loss can be observed on both
NO and NH3 emissions. For 0.9 < φ < 1.1, the difference of NO emission
is minor for adiabatic and radiative conditions. In comparison, the NO
emission is decreased at lean (φ < 0.9) or rich condition (φ > 1.1). The
decreasing becomes larger as the equivalence ratio goes to the leaner
(richer)  condition.  As  the  flame  goes  to  deep  leaner  or  richer  for  the
radiative  condition,  flame  temperature  decreases,  resulting  in  a

lence ratio. Reprinted from Ref. [237] with permission Elsevier.

suppression  effect  on  the  thermal  decomposition  of  unburned  NH3.
Therefore,  a  larger  NH3  slip  is  seen  when  the  radiative  heat  loss  is
considered.  Moreover,  in  the  gas-turbine  combustor,  due  to  the  large
amount of bypass air,  the wall heat loss would be a significant  influ-
encing factor on NOx and NH3 emissions in ammonia fueled gas turbines.

4.8.2. Heat loss effect on swirl flame

The  flame  in  the  swirl  combustor  suffers  strong  radiative  or
convective heat loss, which will affect flame structure and further flame
stabilization character. Guiberti et al. [292] studied the effect of wall
heat loss on the transition of combustion mode for hydrogen-enriched
CH4/air  flame.  The  results  indicate  that  the  heat  loss  in  the  ORZ
would  affect  the  transition  from  V-shaped  to  M-shaped  flame,  which
reduces  flame  stability  and  combustion  efficiency  and  may  alter  the
pollutant emissions. A recent study of Okafor et al. [237] demonstrates
that the main emission of swirl NH3/air flame is substantially influenced
by wall heat loss. The behavior of NO and N2O shows a contradictive
trend with which already reported in the literature. In the experiment,
they used three types of cylindrical combustor liners to mimic different
degrees  of  wall  heat  loss.  An  uninsulated  steel  (UnSUS)  liner  and  an
insulated steel (InSUS) liner were applied to the swirl burner to simulate
the  adiabatic  and  radiative  conditions,  respectively.  An  uninsulated
quartz glass (UnGLS) liner was used to allow laser diagnostics and to
simulate smaller heat loss compared with the UnSUS liner. Fig. 75 shows
the  radial  distribution  of  NO  and  unburned  NH3  for  the  UnSUS  and
InSUS liners at φ = 0.9. For the InSUS liner (adiabatic condition), the
unburned  NH3  barely  changes  with  r  and  NO  emission  shows  slight
decrease when r > 4 mm. In comparison, for the UnGLS liner (with wall

heat  loss),  NO  emission  largely  decreases  while  the  unburned  NH3
significantly increases with r which exceeds the measuring range (5000
ppmv) when r > 8 mm. It should be noted that the difference between
two liners is growing as the position going close to the chamber wall,
indicating  the  increasing  heat  loss  effect  at  near-wall  region.  This
conclusion can be further verified with the NO-PLIF measurement in a
swirl combustor by cooling the chamber wall with air film cooling [293]
and the numerical results of Vigueras et al. [294,295]. In the NO-PLIF
experiment of Zhang et al. [293], an air film cooling was performed at
each side wall. The quartz glass walls were mounted allowing laser di-
agnostics. The quantity of wall heat loss was controlled by the cooling
air flow rate Qcooling, with the stronger heat loss by larger Qcooling. The
NO-PLIF  was  performed  at  the  center  plane  and  the  near-wall  plane.
Fig. 76 shows the NO-PLIF images in different Qcooling at x = the center
plane. The direct comparison of the intensity of each image can be made
since the same settings for the laser and ICMOS camera were applied.
The flame front indicated by boundary of NO profile, tends to be rela-
tively farther from the combustor wall due to the enhanced convection
heat loss by the cooling air, indicating the non-negligible heat loss effect
at near-wall region.

Fig. 77 shows the main emissions with different liners (different heat
loss) conducted by Okafor et al. [237]. The NO and unburned NH3  for
adiabatic  conditions  show  a  similar  trend  and  value  with  the  data  in
Refs. [188,190,284]. However, the NO emissions are much lower when
heat loss is considered at φ < 1.0, with the value of 55 ppmv at φ = 0.8.
By comparing the NO and unburned NH3, it is found that the low NO
emission is obtained together with large unburned NH3  at lean condi-
tions, which is mainly resulted from the decreased NH3  consumption.
Due to the wall heat loss, the decreasing temperature at near wall region
may hinder the O/H radical production, which is a main contribution to
the NO production. Moreover, NO reduction id promoted by the residual
NH3 in the exhaust. The understanding of the heat loss helps to design
the cooling strategy of the combustion chamber. For example, Kumuk
cooling angle can reach a low NOx value
et al. [296] indicates that a 15
without affecting the average combustion chamber temperature.

◦

One important goal of applying NH3  combustion is to decrease the
greenhouse gas. However, as seen in Fig. 77, the large increase of N2O
may be another important issue when the heat loss is considered. At φ =

0.8, N2O emission can be as high as 600 ppmv which is much larger than
NO  (55  ppmv)  and  may  cause  much  greater  greenhouse  effect.  By
analyzing the reactions related to N2O, the main contribution to N2O
production is the reaction of NO with NH by NH + NO ↔ N2O + H in the
flame. The N2O thermal decomposition with the reactions N2O + H ↔
N2 + OH and N2O(+M) ↔ N2 + O(+M) at the post flame zone are the
main consumption source of N2O [264], which  requires the tempera-
tures above 1100 K. The temperature decreasing caused by wall heat loss
promotes  the  NO  reduction  and  hinders  the  N2O  consumption  rate,
resulting in NOx emission from the NH3/air flames consisting mainly of
N2O. This conclusion can be also verified by the LES study of An et al.
[239], shown in Fig. 78, indicating a strong correlation between the high
temperature and the N2O concentration in ammonia containing flames.

5. Challenges and future prospects

Ammonia, which is attractive using as a fuel and low risk, is a po-
tential long-term pathway for the de-carbonization to zero carbon. The
combustion  community  would  spare  no  effort  to  achieve  ammonia
combustion from fundamental investigations to applications. However,
ammonia combustion and co-firing ammonia with other fuels may still
need to be studied and applied during the transition phase starting from
fossil  fuels  to  fully  carbon  free  fuel.  As  depicted  in  Fig.  79,  the  de-
carbonization  effect  is  visible  only  when  XNH3  is  large.  For  example,
the CO2 is only reduced by less than 30 % for XNH3  = 0.5 and the CO2
reduction will reach 80 % when XNH3 is higher than 0.92. To fulfill the
goal  of  de-carbonization,  the  investigation  topics  on  the  combustion
should focus on fuels with high ammonia containing combustion or pure
ammonia combustion.

This  work  reviews  the  ammonia  combustion  towards  the  applica-
tions in GTs, as shown in Fig. 80. Fundamentals of laminar and turbulent
cases are primary essential for understanding the combustion behavior
in swirl flames. Lab-scale swirl flames present the stable regions, flame
stabilization  mechanisms  and  combustion  emissions,  which  provide
guidance for chamber design. To improve the thermal power making the
flame  more  compact,  the  combustion  at  high  pressure  or  fueled  with
liquid phase NH3 should be applied. Investigations in combustion at gas-
turbine-like conditions is still insufficient. To extend the findings in swirl

combustor to GT’s combustion chamber, the primary focuses should be
scaling power to practical level while maintaining high combustion ef-
ficiency and low NOx. Another issue is the air distribution by the liner.
As concluded in Fig. 80, air is distributed by the swirler and the holes in
the liner, which may be divided into primary air, secondary air, dilution
air and cooling air. By properly arranging the primary air from swirler,
secondary air and dilution air from liner, combustion patterns such as
rich-quench-lean  (RQL)  and  moderate  or  intense  low  oxygen  dilution
(MILD) can be achieved. Therefore, there is still great potentials in the
combustion  field  to  realize  the  large-scale  application  of  ammonia  in
GTs.

This section firstly concludes the current challenges in fundamentals
and methodologies. Then, some future research prospects are addressed
and concluded for ammonia combustion community below.

5.1. Influences of flame properties on flame stabilization

Flame stabilization of swirl flames involves the recirculation of hot
products  by  ORZ  and  IRZ.  Ammonia  combustion  differs  significantly
from hydrocarbons and hydrogen due to its unique properties such as
lower  flame  speed,  temperature, and  slower  reaction  kinetics.  It  is  of
primary importance to investigate the influence of combustion proper-
ties of ammonia fuel or cofiring fuels on swirl flame in gas turbine model
combustors. The properties are mainly reflected in the following aspects.

1)  Low reactivity of ammonia leads to the narrow flammability limit
and further leads to narrower flame stabilization for swirl flame.
2)  Extremely low flame propagation speed makes it difficult to match
the incoming flow, results in a long flame and the large difficulties to
stabilize the flame, as a consequence.

3) Extremely  small  extinction  stretch  rate  leads  to  easy  flame  extin-

guishing under strong turbulence.

4) The flame-turbulence is inactive compared with methane combus-
tion and it is easy to reach the broken reaction zone since the flame
thickness is large.

The influence of ammonia flame properties above on the flame sta-
bilization of gas turbine swirl flame is not fully understood. Thus, further
fundamental researches are needed.

5.2. Understand the NOx  production mechanism

One promising combustion technology is the lean premixed (LPM)
combustion. However, this concept is not suitable for ammonia, since it
produces a large amount of NOx in lean-combustion but very low NOx at
rich conditions. This gives a basic idea that NOx mainly comes from the
fuel NOx  for ammonia combustion [166,181,187]. NO is formed from
NHi oxidation through HNO intermediate when the concentration of O,
H and OH radicals are large. Even though flame stabilization and the
blow-off  limit  of  ammonia  swirl  combustion  can  be  improved  and
extended by adding small reactive molecule fuel. Nevertheless, this also
brings  a  new  issue  of  high  NOx  emissions,  comparing  with  the  pure
ammonia combustion. Experiments showed that when a small amount of
methane or hydrogen was added to ammonia swirl combustion [111,
188,263],  NOx  emission  and  the  nitrogen  element  in  the  fuel  do  not
show a linear correlation for the cofiring flames. Therefore, the forma-
tion mechanism of NOx will largely depend on the mole fraction ratio of
methane/hydrogen in the fuel. The experimental results show that the
NOx emission reaches its highest value in a gas turbine model combustor
when the methane ratio XCH4  is about 0.5, when varying the methane
ratio  from  0  to  1.0  [186,195].  However,  the  NOx  formation  and  the
control of NOx  emission for ammonia containing fuels (regulated with
active  fuels)  have  not  been  fully  understood  and  elucidated.  The
mechanisms of the temperature, fuel composition, cross reactions on the
thermal  and  fuel  NOx  have  not  been  systematically  investigated.  It  is
vital  to  investigate  the  key  influencing  factors  of  NOx  formation  to

realize large-scale application of ammonia in the power devices.

5.3. Understand the role of flame-wall interaction

Based on the previous researches results, the flame stabilization and
NOx emission are the main technical bottlenecks restricting the utiliza-
tion of ammonia fuel. Flame-wall interaction is one of the key scientific
issues in the study of flame stabilization by the physical effect, and NOx
emission by the chemical effect. However, the current works in litera-
tures  are  mainly  focused  on  the  general  characteristics  of  the  flame
stabilization  and  NOx  emission.  Even  though  few  studies  were  con-
ducted  on  ideal  flame  such  as  planar  flame  and  other  laminar  flame
[237,238,293], the research on the scientific natures related to the low
flame  speed  and  strong  flame-wall  interaction  effect  is  very  limited,
especially in the real combustion chamber structures, i.e., gas-turbine
combustor. In order to apply ammonia as a fuel in the combustion de-
vice  or the power plant, the essential mechanism of flame-wall inter-
action in the combustion process under complex flow, especially for the
continuous  steady  flame,  need  further
investigation  and  deep
understanding.

5.4. Investigation methodologies

5.4.1. High-speed, resolution simultaneous measurements

The  significant  difference  between  ammonia  combustion  and  the
hydrocarbon fuels is the flame speed and the pathway of NOx production
when it is used as the fuel to gas turbine. Since the flame speed and the
extinction stretch rate of NH3/air flame is one fifth and one third of that
of  CH4/air  flame, the  stretching  and  flame  wrinkling  due  to  the  flow
field  as  well  as  the  flame-turbulence  interaction  will  be  significantly
different,  as  indicated  in  Ref.  [37].  Therefore,  it  firstly  needs  the
simultaneous time evolution of combustion field (such as NH, OH) and
the  flow  field  (OH/PIV,  NO/PIV)  to  understand  the  turbulence-flame
interaction, such as revising the turbulence diagram, visualizing flame
broadening etc. Also, the time history of these two fields in the swirl
structure can be used to understand the flame stabilization mechanism
for  the  gas  turbine  combustor,  as  depicted  in  Refs.  [201,214,297].
However, it is still very few results in this field. Secondly, in the chamber
design, ammonia flame always suffers local extinction due to cooling air
near the wall, inevitable NO production near the secondary air holes due
to  the  fresh  air,  which  is  very  essential  for  combustion design.  These
processes can be well reflected by the local species, velocity, and tem-
perature.  Therefore,  the  simultaneous  measurements  should  be  con-
ducted in swirl combustors at important combustion locations (near the
swirler, near the wall with cooling air, near the secondary air inlet etc.)
to  understand  the  local  chemical  or  physical  phenomena,  providing
guidance to the combustor design. Thus the relation between the key
species and temperature should be fully understood and illustrated by
experimental  data,  for  example  the  simultaneous  OH(NO)/T  [111],
NH/T profiles [298]. Through there were some measurement techniques
reported in recent years [299–303], (some of them are 1D [300,301]),
very  limited  information  related  to  these  experimental measurements
has been reported in the swirl combustor, since the concentration of NH
is low and the life time is short. Fig. 81 shows an example of simulta-
neous NH(NO)/temperature distribution of high Ka number jet flames
and the simultaneous NH3/NH/NO measurements.

5.4.2. High-efficient LES models for large-scale CFD

1)  Chemical kinetics mechanism

More efficient with high-precision chemical kinetics mechanisms are
needed  to  analyze  the  key  pathways  on  fuel  consumption,  emission
production as well as the turbulence-chemistry interaction in CFD. Since
ammonia combustion are oriented to industrial needs such as gas tur-
bines,  we  therefore  need  more  accurate,  reliable  and  much  simpler

reprinted from Ref. [313].

mechanism  for  the  CFD.  However,  at  present,  the  chemical  kinetics
mechanisms of ammonia combustion [138,245,304–306] are still large,
though some of them were reduced to 30 species [245,253,259]. So far,
the high precision simulations are mostly limited in the laboratory scale
and it is still difficult to apply to the large-scale power plant, i.e., GTs. A
robust  mechanism  for  the  combustion  gas  turbine  should  be  small
enough  and  be  able  to  give  the  reliable  prediction  on  the
marco-structure of combustion as well as the emission production.

2)  Large eddy simulation models

There  are  two  advantages  using  Thickened  flame  (TF)  model
[307–309] when simulating the ammonia combustion. The first reason
may be that it needs a smaller thickening factor since the flame thickness
of  NH3/air  is  large.  It  can  capture  the  instantaneous  combustion
behavior and properly reduce the computing cost at the same time. The
second one is that the emission is calculated through chemical reaction
in this model which is performed with finite rate chemistry. Therefore, it
has  good  ability  predicting  the  emission  formation  (mainly  NOx).
However, there are strict requirements on the size of the mechanisms
when using the models with finite rate chemistry, such as TF model. In
addition,  ammonia  needs  a  higher  ignition  energy  and  the  flame  is
sensitive to turbulence. Thus, the turbulence-flame interaction should be
accurately described in ammonia combustion simulation. Also, the TF
model for non-premixed condition needs further develop. In compari-
son, FGM is a good way to obtain the macro structure of the flame with a
very  low  computational  cost  comparing  with  TF  model  even  with
detailed  chemical  mechanism  [310,311].  FGM  needs  extra  transport
equations  for  long  life-time  species  such  as  NO  to  improving  its  pre-
diction capability, since the concentration also depends on flow effects.

permission of Elsevier.

Moreover, one need to build the high dimensional manifolds considering
stretch rate and heat loss to accurately capture the flame structure which
is  very  technical  and  time  consuming.  For  example,  it  is  proved  that
[239] the transport effect of the species is critical to predict the 2D NO
profile  and  the  NO  emission  with  FGM  method.  Other  numerical
methodologies such as machine learning, PDF can be also applied do the
simulation on ammonia combustion which needs to be further studied.

3)  Boundary conditions

When simulating a gas turbine model combustor, one non-negligible
factor in the simulation is the boundary condition specification. Since
heat loss has a huge influence on flame stabilization and emission for-
mation [237,238], the boundary condition, especially heat loss, needs to
be preciously considered. Somarathne et al. [240] simulated the same
flow and combustion condition with different wall temperature which
further emphasizes the importance of the thermal boundary condition.
Furthermore,  the  iso-thermal  boundary  condition  may  still  be  not
enough to describe the heat loss. One should decide the actual quantity
of the heat loss through the thermal boundary based on the experimental
measurements and the engine operating conditions. Other boundary like
turbulence should be also accurately provided to obtain good results.

5.5. Towards combustion techniques

5.5.1. High pressure combustion and staged combustion

The main propose conducting high-pressure combustion is to fit for
the actual combustion phenomena in the real chamber. The pressure can
reach  several  megapascal  within  the  GT’s  combustion  chamber.  For
example, the combustion occurs under the pressure of about 2.0 MPa in
the  state-of-the-art  H/J  class  heavy  duty  GT.  The  pressure  increasing
would  induce more intensive  combustion, more compact heat release
and less effect of the wall heat loss. Moreover, the pressure change also
modifies the residence time of the combustion which would also influ-
ence  the  NOx  production  [312].  These  phenomena  would  be  quite
distinct,  especially  for  ammonia  fuel  with  low  flame  speed  and  low
chemical  activity.  Therefore,  the  research  results  under  atmospheric
pressure cannot directly indicate the combustion characteristics under
high  pressure.  Okafor  et  al.  [111,188]  conducted  the  ammonia  swirl
flame  under  high  pressure  up  to  0.5  MPa.  They  studied  the  pressure
effect  on  flame  stabilization,  flame  blow-off  behavior  and  the  main
emission characteristics. However, the influence of combustion pressure
on ammonia combustion characteristics still needs further investigation.
Thus, high-pressure effects on ammonia swirl combustion would be an
important topic for future studies.

As  reviewed  in  this  work,  one  effective  way  to  mitigate  the  NOx
emission is the staged combustion [111,188,240,273–277], which burns
ammonia at low NOx condition in the main combustion zone and further
reduces  NOx  with  reaction  at  secondary  zone.  Therefore,  we  should
firstly understand the effects of primary air and secondary air on NOx
emission control. Furthermore, the flame is confined in the combustion
liner which is in a high-pressure environment as shown in Fig. 82. The
secondary air holes, which could provide multiple staged combustion,
can be arranged on the combustion liner. However, the amount of sec-
ondary air is highly coupled with the primary air and tertiary air by the
minimal  pressure  loss,  which  is  controlled  by  the  liner  geometry.
Therefore, further investigations on the coupling effects of primary and
secondary air on NO reduction should also be performed.

5.5.2. Liquid ammonia combustion

When fueling ammonia in GTs or ICEs, vaporizers and accumulators
with high capacities are needed to ensure the high load operation con-
dition  since  the  amount  of  fuel  supply  is  large.  Direct  combustion  of
liquid  ammonia  is  a  potential  way.  However,  liquid  ammonia  shows
large different fuel properties such as low boiling point, high latent heat
of  evaporation.  Moreover,  the  evaporation  process  is  different  from
traditional  fuels  such  as  gasoline  and  diesel,  methanol  since  the
ammonia liquid is easier to locate at its superheated or saturated con-
dition  [314,315].  There  would  be  a  very  intense  flash  boiling

phenomena  before  combustion  which  would  largely  deteriorate  the
flame stabilization [316]. Okafor et al. [209] reported the work of liquid
ammonia spray combustion showing the flame stabilization range with
ammonia heat fraction in the fuel up to 90 % is comparable with gaseous
ammonia combustion. They found that the temperature goes to as low as
220 K, as shown in Fig. 83, in the spray field because it needs a large
amount of heat to vaporize the liquid ammonia. Increasing LNH3  flow
rate does not change the temperature near the nozzle. Even though there
is  no  available  data  showing  the  temperature  near  the  nozzle  when
combustion is present, it can infer that the temperature would exhibit
large gradient from the evaporation zone to the combustion zone. Since
swirl flame is quasi steady, the local temperature at flame base will be
largely fluctuated due to alternate appearing of droplet vaporization and
combustion heat release. This would cause local extinction and further
make the flame unstable. Further investigation of Yamashita et al. [211,
231]  shows  the  chamber  inlet  temperature  of  air  enhances  the  flame
stabilization. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study is found
so far in the literature revealing flame stabilization mechanism of liquid
ammonia swirl spray flame. The work on liquid spray swirl combustion,
especially  the  understanding  on  flame  stabilization,  droplet  flame
interaction,  is  still  far  from  enough.  Therefore,  relevant  researches
should  be  conducted  to  extend  ammonia  as  the  gas  turbine  fuel  (see
Fig. 84).

5.5.3. Combustion with partial ammonia cracking

The concept of partially cracked ammonia fueled GT system is pro-
posed to enhance the combustion as reviewed in Ref. [317]. Ammonia is
partially cracked into H2  and N2  and then supplied to the combustion
chamber with the remaining ammonia which is also regarded as a po-
tential strategy to realize zero carbon emission. This way can enhance
the  combustion  [318]  and  it  may  also  control  the  NOx  emissions  by
adjusting  the  cracking  ratio.  Even  though  some  investigations  were
already  performed  [194,319–321]  under  various  cracking  ratios  in
turbulent flames, modeled ICE and GT combustion, the products of NH3
cracking were substituted by only N2  and H2  which is far from the re-
ality.  In  fact,  decomposition  of  ammonia  involves  complex  chemical
processes, which depends on the way of decomposition. There are also
other  intermediate  species,  such  as  NH2  or  NH  which  would  largely
facilitate the combustion by the chemical effects. Therefore, components
should be NH3, H2, N2 and other minor intermediate species. In addition,
the  mixture  should  also  be  supplied  to  the  combustion  chamber  at
cracking  temperature,  i.e.,  400–600
C.  These  inputs  should  be  fully
satisfied if one intends to study the “combustion with partial ammonia
cracking”.  One  direct  way  is  using  in  situ  ammonia  cracking  before
fueling the ammonia to the chamber. However, to the best of the au-
thor’s knowledge, there is no research so far conducted on flame per-
formance  using  the  ammonia  in  situ  cracking  process.  The  coupled
chemical and thermal effects on combustion enhancing and NOx control
are far from understood. Therefore, the swirl combustion system should
be updated or newly designed accompany with the decomposition part.
in  situ  ammonia
The  experiments  should  be  conducted  with
decomposition.

◦

5.5.4. Plasma assisted combustion

Plasma  provides  a  good  compensation  to  the  low  reactivity  of
ammonia  in  its  combustion.  Therefore,  there  would  be  great

opportunities for plasma in swirl flames to strengthen the ignition pro-
cess under extreme conditions and to enhance the flame stabilization in
the border of operating region. As discussed earlier, plasma extends the
lean and rich blow-off limits, which is consistent in the experiments of
Ref.  [227,231,322].  However,  in  the  literature,  some  explanation
concluded that the enhancement on flame stabilization by plasma was
due to thermal effect, while others demonstrated enhancement effects
via  kinetics  and  transport (e.g.,  ionic wind).  For  NO emissions  of  the
hydrocarbon fuels, the mechanism of NOx reduction can be understood
that plasma moderates flame temperature with a broadened flame area
which reduces the thermal NOx  production [323]. For ammonia com-
bustion with large fuel NOx production, Choe et al. [231] found a clear
decrease  in  NO  when  the  voltage  is  10  kV,  as  shown  in  Fig.  85.  The
possible  reason  is  that  plasma  produces  HO2  and  NH2  species  which
would enhance NO consumption by HO2 and NH2 pathways. However,
no clear NO reduction is observed by the others [232,322], which may
be  caused  by  the  insufficient  voltage  or  the  power.  In  the  review  of
plasma assisted combustion [226,324], it has declared the effects and
revealed the dynamics. However, the mechanisms of ammonia plasma
assisted combustion involves other effects, especially in NOx reduction
[325]. Therefore, the combustion community should make more efforts
to gain a thorough understanding of the impacts of plasma on ammonia
combustion and NOx  reduction chemical kinetics in order to overcome
the limitations of ammonia use in practical applications.

5.5.5. Moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution combustion

Moderate or Intense Low-Oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion [120,
326–331]  was  considered  as  a  potential  combustion  technology  for
direct ammonia combustion because it entails oxidation processes based
on local distributed autoignition instead of the deflagrative and diffusive
flames [327–329,331]. In a chamber, MILD combustion can be reached
with  a very  high recirculation  level  of exhausted gas  that ensures  re-
actants virtually fill the entire chamber. In particular, a highly diluted
and  pre-heated  reactants  are  formed  to  characterized  by  a  local  tem-
perature higher than the autoignition temperature and a highly diluted
mixture which falls outside the flammability limits. One attraction from
MILD combustion is the fuel flexibility and its ability in extending flame
stabilization and controlling NOx. The inherent features are summarized
in Fig. 86.

MILD combustion is a state-defined combustion pattern which can be
achieved  by  various  configurations,  such  as  jet  flow  [332],  co-flow
structure [333], metal fiber mesh structure [329] as well as swirl flow
[334]. The description of basic mechanism of MILD combustion tech-
nology  makes  it  a  potential  combustion  technology  for  an  effective
utilization of ammonia. Indeed, coupling the stabilization mechanism of
local  autoignition  with  typical  operational  working  temperature  win-
dows, which coincides with kinetics that do not favor the NOx produc-
tion,  makes it  easy to  have  ammonia  combustion  in  MILD conditions
with  a  relatively  low  impact  on  NOx  emission.  Several  studies  have
explored the characteristics of swirl combustion under MILD conditions
[35,331].  These  studies  pointed  out  that  it  leads  to  more  uniform
combustion, reduced hot spots, and a more stable and efficient process
[331,335]  which  improves  NOx  emission,  and  mitigates  ammonia
reactivity  issues.  Combustors  operating  in  MILD  combustion  mode
exhibit low emissions of NOx and unburned NH3, but high dilution levels
are  required  to  maintain  these  low  emissions,  resulting  in  several

challenges in the design and subsequent operation of gas turbines [335].

6. Concluding remarks

The decarbonation demand all over the world requires a low-carbon/
carbon-free sustainable energy system for all the international govern-
ments.  The  most  promising  solution  may  be  the  “hydrogen  energy”
which contains no carbon. Due to the difficulties in the hydrogen (H2)
storage and transportation, ammonia (NH3), which is also carbon free,
has merged to the combustion community as the hydrogen carrier since
it consists of 17.6 % hydrogen by weight. Other advantages as a fuel, like
its  productibility,  availability,  amenability  to  storage  and  transport
inspire the recent researches on its application in gas turbines. However,
due  to  the  low  reactivity,  slow  flame  propagation  and  high  nitrogen
content, the poor flame stabilization and high NOx  are two main chal-
lenges  before  the  large-scale  implementation  in  gas  turbines.  This  re-
view  has  assessed  the  progress  of  the  ammonia  combustion  in  gas
turbine  model  combustors  and  its  prospects  in  the  future.  The  main
concluding remarks are summarized as follows.

1.  Ammonia shows narrower flammability limits of 15.8 % and 28.0 %
compared with methane. The slower laminar flame speed, about one
fifth of that of CH4/air combustion, leads to the difficulties to sta-
bilize the laminar or turbulent jet flame without other additives. In
addition, the thicker flame will largely modify the flame turbulence
interaction compared with other fuels. Those two properties would
result in the NH3/air flames being more prone to locate within the
broken reaction zone in the turbulent flame diagram. Due to the high
nitrogen  content  in  its  molecule,  high NO  emission  is  observed  at
lean conditions and the maximum NO occurs at the equivalence ratio
of  φ  ~  0.9.  Therefore,  the  “lean  premixed  combustion”,  a  well-
proven concept for natural gas to realize ultra-low NOx  due to the
low temperature of the flame, is not a suitable strategy for ammonia
combustion.

2.  Both premixed and non-premixed NH3/air flames can be stabilized in
swirl combustors with different burner dimension, burner geometry
and swirl number S. The flame is higher than that of CH4/air flame at
the same flow condition and the stable regions of the swirl NH3/air
flames  are  much  narrower  than  that  of  CH4/air  flames.  A  general
feature of the flame macrostructures transition with for combustion
modes  can be observed when  gradually  decreases the  equivalence
ratio  from  a  stable  flame.  And  the  transition  from  an  “M”  shaped
flame to the “V” shaped flame can be regarded as the early warning
of blow-off. A large portion of the flame is suffered from the excessive
stretch during the whole blow-off process for NH3/air flame, indi-
cating the smaller flame resistance to the flow.

3.  One  main  reason  causing  the  difficulties  on  flame  stabilization  of
NH3/air flame is the low flame speed resulting from the low reac-
tivity. Thus, the addition of active small molecule to the unburned
mixture could be a direct way to enhance the flame stabilization by
enhancing the chemical effect and physical effect. The physical effect
on flame stability is to increase the capability of the flame root to
resist  flame  extinction.  The  chemical  effect  includes  the  enhance-
ment of the key species such as NHi at flame root. Another effective
way is the plasma assistance for ammonia combustion since plasma
ionizes, dissociates the fuel molecules and recombines the radicals
which could also produce the key species for combustion enhance-
ment and further extends the lean blow-off limits.

4. Pure liquid ammonia swirl spray flame can also be successfully sta-
bilized in the gas turbine model combustors. Due to the vaporization
process of liquid fuel and the mixing with air, the temperature near
the nozzle is reaching 220 K in the spray, which may lead to strong
local  heat  loss,  local  flame  distinction  and  further  deteriorate  the
flame  stabilization.  However,  the  flame  stabilization  can  be
enhanced  by  cofiring  liquid  ammonia  with  methane  or  hydrogen.

The pure liquid ammonia spray swirl flame with larger stable region
can be obtained increasing the chamber inlet temperature.

5.  In single-stage swirl flames, large NO, of the order of 1000 ppm, is
observed at lean conditions with the peak value at φ  ≈ 0.9. NO is
sharply decreased from φ = 0.9 to 1.1 and keeps a lower value which
is in the order of 10 ppm for φ > 1.1. The concentrations of NO and
NH3 reach relatively small values simultaneously when φ is around
1.05.  NOx  formation  in  ammonia  combustion  primarily  generates
through the fuel NOx pathway, because ammonia itself is a direct
source of nitrogen. In the fuel-lean conditions, HNO intermediate is
the most important species for NOx generation, and reaction HNO +
M ≤> NO + H + M dominates NO production. In fuel-rich condi-
tions, the main reactions dynamics are NH3 + H = NH2 + H2, NH2 +
H = NH + H2, and NH + H = N + H2. N2 may be produced via the
intermediate  NNH  pathway,  bypassing  NO  formation.  This  is  the
main reason for the lower NO emissions in ammonia flames under
fuel-rich conditions.

6.  A small amount of methane or hydrogen addition to NH3/air flames
significantly  increase  the  NOx  emission.  The  experimental  results
show that the NOx emission reaches its highest value in a gas turbine
model combustor when the methane ratio XCH4  is about 0.5. In the
ammonia containing flames, NO is mostly produced through the fuel
NOx path caused by the oxidation of NHi. The pathway for NO pro-
duction is largely contributed from the concentration of O, H and OH
radicals.  Therefore,  methane  or  hydrogen  addition  would  largely
enhance  the  contribution  of  HNO  pathway  due  to  the  increasing
concentration of H, OH.

7.  NO  can  be  effectively  controlled  by  the  staged  combustion.  By
applying the rich-lean combustion strategy, NO production can be
significantly reduced because ammonia burns at low NOx condition
in  the  primary  zone  and  NOx  is  further  reduced  at  the  secondary
zone. NOx emission of 42 ppmv with combustion efficiency of 99.5 %
was achieved in the literature in a two-stage combustion chamber at
0.3 MPa. Another effective way to improve the NOx emissions is the
fuel  staged  strategy.  The  possible  explanations  are  that  thermal
DeNOx process will play an important role in mitigating NO emis-
sions when the exit temperature of the primary region is close to the
threshold  for  active  NO  reduction.  In  the  secondary  zone,  NH3  is
mainly converted to N2 through the NH3→NH2→NNH→N2 pathway.
A decreasing NO behavior is observed when the combustion pressure
is increased. The OH reduction reaction with the third body of OH +
H + M ≤> H2O + M is highly sensitive to the combustion pressure
and would be promoted as pressure increasing. Therefore, NO pro-
duction is suppressed due to the OH radical concentration decreasing
at high pressure.

8.  The emission characteristics are largely affected by the wall heat loss,
which  may  be  caused  by  the  heat  radiation  or  convection  by  the
chamber wall. As the heat loss increasing, the flame front, indicated
by NO profile, tends to be relatively farther from the combustor wall
and the flame is more fragmentized, indicating the local quenching
at near wall region. Global NO emission decreases with increasing
heat loss. A 55 ppmv of NO emission was recorded under the con-
dition  with  wall  heat  loss.  The  primary  reason  is  the  decreased
combustion  efficiency  of  NH3  at  near  wall  region.  Secondly,  NO
production from HNO and NH pathway is hindered due to the local
decreased OH. Lastly, the larger unburned NH3 in the exhausted gas
may also consumes NO by the NO reduction reactions. However, N2O
emission  can  be  as  high  as  NO  which  may  cause  much  greater
greenhouse effect. The temperature decreasing caused by wall heat
loss promotes the NO reduction and hinders the N2O consumption
rate,  resulting  NOx  emission  from  the  NH3/air  flames  consisting
mainly of N2O.

9.  For the future prospects, we firstly need to understand the intrinsic
mechanism of flame stabilization caused by the unique properties of
ammonia fuel as well as the NOx production mechanism for ammonia
cofired  combustion.  Secondly,  more  reliable  high-speed,  high-

resolution  measurements  which  are  fit  for  ammonia  combustion
should  be  largely  developed,  such  as  NO  and  NH  measurements.
These data are of primary importance to understand the flame sta-
bilization  and  the  NOx  production.  In  addition,  the  smaller  size
chemical kinetical mechanisms with good prediction capability are
needed  to  evaluate  fuel  consumption,  temperature  distribution,
emission distribution and its production in the realistic combustion
chambers by CFD. Lastly, researches towards the combustion tech-
niques should be fully take into consideration, such as high-pressure
combustion,  staged  combustion,  liquid  ammonia  combustion,
ammonia/hydrogen blends combustion, plasma assisted combustion
as well as MILD combustion.
