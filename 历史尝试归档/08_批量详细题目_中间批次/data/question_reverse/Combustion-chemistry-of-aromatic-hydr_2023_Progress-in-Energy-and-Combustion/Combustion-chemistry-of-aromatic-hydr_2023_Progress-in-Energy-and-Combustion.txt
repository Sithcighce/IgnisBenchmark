Aromatic hydrocarbons are important components of petroleum-based transportation fuels, biomass, coal, and
solid waste, etc. The reaction kinetics of aromatic hydrocarbons largely determine the combustion characteristics
and pollutant emission of vehicle/jet engines, power plants, and industrial reactors. While a few reviews have
recently focused on aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline surrogate fuels, thermochemical conversion of biomass/
coal/solid waste, and combustion soot formation, a dedicated overview of research on the combustion chemistry
of  aromatic  hydrocarbons  is  still  lacking.  In  the  last  decades,  valuable  investigations  addressing  the  reaction
kinetics  were  reported  based  on  the  measurements  from  pyrolysis,  oxidation,  flames,  shock  tubes,  and  rapid
compression  machines,  complemented  by  quantum  chemistry  and  detailed  kinetic  modeling.  Significant  ad-
vances  have  allowed  a  better  understanding  of  such  physicochemical  reacting  system,  from  aromatic  decom-
position,  oxidation,  to  pollutants  formation.  In  the  present  review,  aromatic  hydrocarbons  are  systematically
categorized  to  five  common  classes:  basic,  mono-substituted,  multi-substituted,  hydrogenated,  and  polycyclic
aromatics. Fundamental  aromatic combustion chemistry consists of  the reactions of basic aromatic molecular
structures. Then the aryl group strongly influences the reaction kinetics of aromatic derivates, which leads to
very different combustion performance from those ordinary paraffins, olefins, and naphthenes. This paper seeks
to provide an introduction to the knowledge gathered in the recent research, highlight pertinent aspects of this
rapidly  enriching  information,  and  outlook  the  challenges  towards  fundamentally  comprehensive  aromatic
combustion chemistry and practically efficient aromatic combustion model.

1. Introduction

1.1. Motivations

Energy  is  historically  the  most  important  factor  influencing  the
evolution of human society, and nowadays, it plays a vital role in the
growth  of  economic  and  industrial  output.  Expectation  of  explosive
growth  in  population,  which  may  reach  8.5  billion  in  2030  [1],  in-
troduces considerable concerns on future energy strategy, including the
increasing  consumption  of  nature  resources,  the  increasing  trans-
portation of humans and industrial goods, and the increasing waste from
human activity. All these demands point to one ultimate demand – en-
ergy supply. Today, combustion, the physical and chemical process only,

provides most of the world energy conversion [2], although many al-
ternatives  are  being  discussed  for  power  generation,  such  as  nuclear,
solar, and wind energy, etc.

Aromatic  hydrocarbon  is  one  major  class  of  the  chemical  compo-
nents involved in combustion. In comparison with other hydrocarbons
with identical carbon numbers, aromatics have higher heat content per
unit volume and lower heat content per unit mass. Aromatic hydrocar-
bons are around 20–40% by volume in gasoline, diesel, and aviation jet
fuel, besides paraffins, olefins, and naphthenes [3–9]. The combustion
behavior of these petroleum-based transportation fuels is thus signifi-
cantly impact by aromatic combuston chemistry. Aromatic combustion
chemistry is also crucial in the thermochemical conversion of biomass
[10,11], the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) [12–14], and
the  coke  formation  of  industrial  reactors  [15,16].  For  lignocellulosic

biomass,  propylbenzene  and  alkyl-phenolic  structures  are  the  typical
moieties in the molecular structures, which are also its decomposition
intermediates  [17–19].  For  municipal  solid  waste,  polymerized  and
halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons occupy considerable portion, which
challenges the development of thermal processing by the production of
carcinogenic organic pollutants [13,20]. In the industrial reactors, the
content of aromatics, resins and heavy metals aromatizes to coke, which
impacts the catalyst deactivation and disrupts the catalyst performance
[21,22].

As a result, combustion is a major contributor of air pollutants, such
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particulate matters (PM),
etc. [23,24]. PAH in fly ash is most likely to involve in the formation of
toxic poly-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans [25]. Fine
particulates with a diameter below 2.5 nm generated from the thermal
conversion of PAHs [26] can pass more deeply into the lungs [27,28]. All
these emissions to the environment are associated with human terato-
genesis,  cancer  or  mutations,  with  a  bio-accumulative  effect  [29,30].
Therefore, there is increasing pressure in minimizing toxic pollution but
boosting energy supply. It is a tremendous challenge to reconcile these
two  conflicting  demands  for  the  development  of  future  combustion
systems.  Tremendous  efforts  have  been  made  by  the  scientific  re-
searchers  in  the  last  few  decades  to  develop  advanced  combustion
technology  and  equipment  with  enhanced  combustion  efficiency  and
reduced pollutant emission.

Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation provides an efficient,
low-cost  and  high-fidelity  way  to  investigate  the  thermal  physics/
chemistry in these combustion facilities [31]. CFD simulation couples by
chemical  kinetics  and  fluid  dynamics.  Reliable  computational  models
that  can  predict  the  combustion  performance  and  pollutant  emission
thus  benefit  to  the  designing  of  new  combustion  facilities.  Modeling
aromatic  chemistry  in  combustion  is  therefore  important  in  the  nu-
merical simulation, since it corresponds to the heat release, the flame
front  propagation,  the  fuel  ignition/extinction,  and  the  pollutant  for-
mation.  However,  limited  investigations  on  the  aromatic  combustion

polycyclic  aromatics.  According  the  recent  atomic  force  spectroscopy
iamges,  penta-  and  hexa-aromatic  rings  are  the  most  common  ring
structures  in  aromatic  hydrocarbons  [32,33].  Cyclopentadienyl  are
benzene  are  the  simplest  aromatic  hydrocarbons  with  penta-  and
hexa-rings, thus represent the basic class of aromatic molecular struc-
tures.  Toluene,  styrene  and  phenylacetylene  indicates  the  aromatics
interacted with different aliphatic bonds, therefore were also selected
into the basic class. Alkylbenzenes with multiple alkyl substituents are
the  dominant
[34,35].
Multi-substituted  alkylbenzenes  with  short  side  chains  are  used  as
antiknock additives to enhance octane rating of gasoline [4], whilst the
alkylbenzenes  with  long  side  chains  and  the  hydrogenated  aromatics
improve the auto-ignition property of diesel [5,36,37]. In the past de-
cades, an increasing number of investigations have been performed on
these  aromatic  hydrocarbons,  and  significant  progress  has  been  ach-
ieved on their combustion chemistry: detailed chemical speciation and
characteristic combustion parameters were widely measured in experi-
ments;  reactions  and  rate  coefficients  were  evaluated  via  high-level
quantum chemical calculations and shock tube measurements; kinetic
models  were  developed  for  the  combustion  of  some  aromatic  hydro-
carbons, considering both their oxidation and pollutants emission. This
review highlights those recent advances in the combustion chemistry of
aromatic hydrocarbons, which aims for the perspective of not only the
further  fundamental  investigation  but  also  the  wider  industrial
application.

1.2. Approaches of studying aromatic chemistry

1.2.1. Molecular structures of aromatic hydrocarbons

The presence of the stable aromatic ring in aromatic hydrocarbons
makes their general combustion characteristics very different from al-
kanes,  alkenes  and  cycloalkanes.  Table  1  presents  the  physical  and
chemical  properties  of  typical  aromatics,  comparing  to  typical  non-
aromatic hydrocarbons.

Some common features are described below.

i. Aromatics have higher research octane number (RON) than al-
kanes, alkenes and cycloalkanes with equivalent C-atoms, which
means  lower  oxidation  reactivity.  One  common  reason  is  the
formation of various resonance stabilized radicals (RSRs) in the
combustion of aromatics, e.g. benzyl, xylyl, phenoxy and cyclo-
pentadienyl. The long-lived RSRs have lower reactivity with O2
than normal radicals. Instead, they recombine other active radi-
cals as radical sink. Aromatic ring also influences the reactivity of
aromatic hydrocarbon. The electron-rich aromatic ring favors the
electrophilic substitution of alkyl substituent and the addition of
O and OH, etc.

ii.  The  combustion  of  aromatic  hydrocarbon  is  influenced  by  the
length  of  alkyl  substituent.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  methyl-
benzenes are less reactive than benzene (i.e., higher RON). The
RONs of ethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene are similar to that of
toluene, while the RON of n-butylbenzene is much smaller. This is
generally  because  the  “alkyl  characteristic”  of  alkylbenzene  is
increasing with the length of alkyl substituent and the alkyl sites
far from aromatic ring are less influenced by the aromatic ring.
Besides,  alkylbenzenes  with  long  alkyl  substituents  proceed
intramolecular H-transfer reaction from the benzylic site, which
in turn initiate the low temperature chain-branching reactions.
iii.  The combustion of aromatic hydrocarbon is  also influenced by
the  adjacent  methyl  (alkyl)  pairs.  For  multi-substituted  alkyl-
benzenes,  the  relative  position  of  alkyl  chain  influences  the
combustion properties, e.g. o-xylene has lower RON than m- and
p-xylenes.  The  trimethylbenzene  with  two  contiguous  methyl
pairs present higher reactivity than those with only one pair, e.g.
the increment of RON from 1,2,4- to 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene is
larger than the decrement from 1,2,4- to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.

For alkylbenzenes with adjacent methyl chains, e.g. xylene, tri-
methylbenzene  and  tetramethylbenzene  in  Table  1,  benzylic
radical oxidation can result in the formation of unstable hydro-
peroxides and other unique reaction intermediates, with the po-
tential for even higher degrees of chain branching.

iv. Yielding sooting indices (YSI) are generally in an order of aro-
matics  > cycloalkanes  > iso-alkanes  > alkenes  > n-alkanes.
Among aromatic hydrocarbons, YSI depends strongly on the fuel
molecular structure. As listed in Table 1, benzene has lower YSI
than other aromatics; YSI increases along with lengthened alkyl-
substituent  for  mono-substituted  aromatics;  YSIs  of  multi-
substituted  aromatics  are  considerably  higher  than  those  of
mono-substituted aromatics; the sooting tendency increases with
polycyclic aromatic rings, as YSIs of bicyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons  (BAHs)  are  significantly  higher  than  those  of  monocyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs).2 In general, aromatic ring makes
high sooting tendency in the combustion of aromatic hydrocar-
bons,  which  can  be  explained  by  the  increasing  production  of
typical PAH precursors, such as benzyl, styrene, indenyl. How-
ever,  the  detailed  chemical  pathways  behind  are  not  fully  un-
derstood so far.

As shown in Fig. 2, typical aromatic molecular has several C–C and
C–H  bonds  besides  the  aromatic  ring.  The  bond  dissociation  energy
(BDE) varies in different sites of C–C and C–H due to the presence of
benzene ring. Table 2 summaries the BDEs of selected aromatic hydro-
carbons.  In  general,  the  C–H bond  on  the  benzene  ring  and  the αC-C
bond  are  strong  in  all  aromatic  hydrocarbons.  The  conjugated  effect
makes the αC-C bond even stronger than those in unsaturated benzene
derivates,  like  phenylacetylene  and  styrene.  Benzylic  C–C  and  C–H
bonds are the weakest in alkylbenzenes, which have lower BDEs than
ordinary alkanes. The BDEs of the benzylic C–C bonds in propylbenzene
and butylbenzene isomers are almost the same as that of ethylbenzene;
and  the  BDEs  of  the  benzylic  C–H  bonds  in  three  xylene  isomers  are
almost the same as that of toluene [45]. All these characteristics make it
easy  for  these  aromatic  molecules  to  produce  resonance-stabilized
benzylic  radicals  via  C–C/C–H  bond  fission  or  H-atom  abstraction  re-
actions. Aromatic hydrocarbons are divided into basic aromatic struc-
tures, mono-substituted alkylbenzenes, multi-substituted alkylbenzenes,
hydrogenated  aromatics,  and  polycyclic  aromatics.  The  combustion
properties of different aromatic hydrocarbons are generally determined
by the basic aromatic structures, and further influenced by the length of
alkyl substituent, the position of aryl group, the number of alkyl chains
and aromatic rings, and so on. All these details will be introduced in the
following sections.

1.2.2. Rate coefficients and quantum chemistry

Reaction pathways and their corresponding rate coefficients are the
fundamental  parameters  of  a  kinetic  model  for  aromatic  combustion.
Experimental measurements were widely performed in shock tube and
other ideal reactors for the accurate rate coefficients [51–60]. However,
massive number of rate coefficients are required for a detailed model to
make it extensively predictive in a wide pressure and temperature range.
Experimental measurements of rate coefficients are time-consuming and
expensive  to  cover  every  elementary  reaction:  many  reactions  are
limited  by  experimental  diagnostic  method  or  precursor  reactants;
experimental instruments are hardly applicable for extreme combustion
conditions beyond moderate temperature and pressure ranges. Experi-
mental approach is, therefore, only applied for the rate coefficients of
those critical reactions in the aromatic combustion.

Rate constants are therefore commonly adopted in models according

2 MAH,  BAH,  and  PAH:  monocyclic,  bicyclic,  and  polycyclic  aromatic  hy-
drocarbon, respectively; “aromatics”  or “aromatic hydrocarbons”  represent all
of them together.

to the rate coefficient rules and structure–activity relationships coupling
experimental data with chemical kinetic theory [61–63]. Accurate cal-
culations of reaction pathways and rate coefficients are now available
for molecular systems as large as aromatics [64–70], because the power
of quantum chemical calculation improves in recent decades [71,72].
Numerous torsional degrees of freedom is a new issue for the calculation
of aromatic chemistry. But fortunately, most of the torsional modes are
effectively  spectator  modes,  which  are  not  directly  involved  in  the
chemistry, thus have feasible approximation for those prototypical re-
actions [71]. Z ́ador et al. [73] summarized the promising strategy for the
accurate calculation of rate coefficients: the accuracy of the electronic
structure  calculations  is  improved  by  balancing  the  level  of  electron
correlation  and  the  basis  set;  the  accuracy  of  theoretical  kinetics  is
improved by balancing the levels of the microcanonical rate coefficient
model and the collision model. Klippenstein [71] highlighted the pre-
dictivity of the state-of-art quantum chemical method, emphasizing the
combination of advanced theories in electronic structure calculations,
reaction rate theory, energy transfer, and master equation simulation.
Critical reactions in the combustion of aromatic hydrocarbons often take
place on highly complex potential energy surfaces with multiple wells
and many possible reaction channels [69,74]. Automatic searching of
complex surfaces and characterizing of the stationary points have been
introduced to determine the reaction kinetics [75], which dramatically

improves the efficiency of quantum calculation and prevents the manual
ignorance of those covert transition states.

1.2.3. Experimental measurement and model development

Large amounts of experimental studies have been carried out on the
combustion of aromatic hydrocarbons (SMM1, Tables S1–S7), covering
a wide range of temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio from zero-
to  two-dimensional  fluid  conditions,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  These  mea-
surements  are  divided  into  two  categories:  fundamental  combustion
parameters  (τ  ignition  delay  time,  SL  laminar  flame  speed,  and  aext
extinction strain rate) and speciation.

Ignition  delay  time  of  aromatic  hydrocarbon  is  an  important
parameter for engine combustion, which was widely measured in shock
tube  (ST)  [76–92]  and  rapid  compression  machine  (RCM)  [87,88,
93–98] in the last few decades. Shock tube and RCM cover the typical
engine operating equivalence ratio, temperature, and pressure ranges of
0.5–2.0,  600–1200 K,  and  1–100 atm [99].  Laminar flame  speed  and
extinction  strain  rate  reflect  the  fundamental  flame  characteristics,
including  diffusivity,  reactivity  and  exothermicity  of  a  combustible
mixture. Due to the relevance to the fuel consumption rate in the com-
bustors, laminar flame speed strongly impacts the combustion efficiency
and exhaust emissions. It is usually measured in spherical combustion
bomb, counter-flow flame and heat-flux burner [100–103], because of
its  strong  dependence  on  the  environment  temperature  and  the  com-
bustion heat release. Extinction strain rate directly relates to the flame
blowout, which represents the flame stability constrained by chemical
kinetics and the interaction between characteristic flow residence time
and chemical reaction time. It is usually measured in the counterflow
flame by increasing the inlet fuel velocity till the extinction [104–107].
Combustion speciation measurements on the pyrolysis and oxidation
of aromatic hydrocarbons over wide temperature, pressure and equiv-
alence  ratio  ranges  are  usually  performed  in  jet-stirred  reactor  (JSR)

[79,108–124], shock tube [125–133], flow reactor [110,111,134–145],
planar laminar premixed flame [114,144,146–154], counterflow flame
[104,105,155–167], and co-flow flame [168–174]. The identification of
the molecular structures and the quantification of their concentration or
mole fractions are achieved by gas chromatography (GC) [7], UV laser
induced  fluorescence  spectroscopy  [175],  Fourier  transform  infrared
spectroscopy  (FTIR)  [7],  electron  impacted/photoionization  mass
spectrometry (EI/PIMS) [176]. In the past decades, supersonic molec-
ular beam sampling technique was commonly coupled with synchrotron
based  vacuum ultraviolet photoionization  mass spectrometry (SVUV--
PIMS)  to  investigate  the  combustion  of  various  organic  compounds
[177].  Photoionization efficiency spectrum was  widely applied in the
identification of active combustion intermediates, including free radi-
cals [177]. Imaging/double image photoelectron-photoion coincidence
(i/i2PEPICO) spectroscopy developed recently is an efficient tool for the
isomer identification in combustion [178–180]. In principle, i/i2PEPICO
spectrometry detects the electrons produced in the ionization process in
coincidence  with  the  ions,  which  enables  the  measurement  of
mass-selected threshold  photoelectron spectra (ms-TPES). Isomers are
identified  by  comparing  the  measured  ms-TPES  with  reference
Franck–Condon  simulations.  As  a  typical  example,  the  isomerization
chemistry from m-xylyl radical to o- and p-xylyls was investigated in the
laminar  premixed  flame  of  m-xylene  using  both  SVUV-PIMS  and  iPE-
PICO [146].

Recent  progress  in  both  experimental  diagnostic  and  theoretical
calculation  leads  to  a  better  understanding  of  aromatic  combustion
chemistry.  Important  reaction  pathways  have  been  comprehensively
investigated,  as  well  as  their  pressure-dependent  rate  constants,  with
respect to the high-level quantum chemical calculation [64–68,70,181]
and high precision laser spectroscopy measurement [51–60]. Extensive
measurements of the fundamental combustion parameters and specia-
tion  provide  valuable  validation  targets  for  the  kinetic  modeling  of

aromatics, not only the decomposition and oxidation of different aro-
matic  species  [182,183],  but  also  those  critical  intermediates  for  the
kinetics of PAH formation from small aromatics [181,184]. A series of
detailed kinetic studies on the single aromatic components benefit the
development  of  the  comprehensive  aromatic  models.  Basic  aromatic
structure  attracts  the  most  kinetic  modeling  investigations:  cyclo-
pentadiene  [185–190], benzene [108,153,191–203], toluene  [79,109,
110,129,204–212],  styrene  [114,213,214],  phenylacetylene  [49];
mono-substituted  [48,88,111,112,118–120,130,133,144,145,150–152,
215–225],  multi-substituted  [84,89,115–117,123,124,131,132,154,
226–230],  polycyclic  [50,113,231–237],  and  hydrogenated  aromatics
[238–242]  have  gradually  decreasing  number  of  modeling  studies.
Identifying commonalities and differences in the combustion chemistry
is a crucial research goal for the kinetic modeling study of various single
aromatic  components.  Comprehensive  aromatic  models  [88,198,208,
243,244] were also developed based on the general knowledge of aro-
matic combustion for the prediction of PAH and soot formation in the
combustion of transportation fuel surrogates and in the thermal engi-
neering conversion.

The  following  sections  of  this  review  summarize  “what  we  have
learned from the kinetic modeling of aromatic combustion” and “what
still  remains  mysterious  in  the  aromatic  combustion  chemistry”.
Fundamental reaction chemistry in the combustion of aromatic hydro-
carbons  will  be  primarily  introduced,  e.g.  cyclopentadiene,  benzene,
toluene,  styrene,  phenylacetylene,  including  the  schematic  reaction
schemes and the rate coefficients of those crucial pathways. The com-
bustion chemistry of different aromatic derivatives will be reviewed at
either  high-  or  low-temperature  conditions,  e.g.  ethylbenzene,  pro-
indene,
pylbenzene,  butylbenzene,  xylenes,

trimethylbenzenes,

methylnaphthalene, and tetralin, etc. Specific combustion characteris-
tics will be analyzed on the impact of alkyl substituents and multiple
aromatic rings. PAH formation is one of the most critical subjects in the
combustion  of  aromatics.  Individual  mass  growth  pathways  and  the
comprehensive route map will be summarized in the following section.
Our general understandings on the aromatic combustion chemistry and
the perspectives for the future research will be concluded at the end, as
the “takeaways” of this review.

2. Fundamental aromatic chemistry from C5  to C8

Core mechanism from hydrogen to C2 is the basis of all hydrocarbon
combustion chemistry, similarly, the reaction kinetics from C5  to C8  is
the  basis  of  aromatic  combustion  chemistry.  Aromatic  combustion
chemistry  dominantly  occurs  on  5–7  membered  carbon  rings,  cyclo-
pentadienyl, phenyl and tropyl, which constitute the initial chemistry of
aromatics  (the  role  of  “C0”3).  The  substituents  of  aromatic  hydrocar-
bons, such as methyl, vinyl, ethynyl, etc., behave as C1  – C2  chemistry
but are strongly impacted by the aromatic rings. The following contents
in this section summarize the fundamental aromatic chemistry.

3  Notation  of  “Cn”  is  different  from  conventional  Cn,  which  represents  one
type  of  aromatic  hydrocarbons  with  the  same  functional  groups.  “C5”,  “C6”,
“C7”,  “C8”,  indicate  the  aromatic  hydrocarbons  with  the  moieties  of  cyclo-
pentadienyl, phenyl, benzyl (and tropyl, vinyl-cyclopentadienyl, fulvenallenyl),
and phenylacetylene (and styrene) in their molecular structures. “C0” indicates
the set of cyclopentadienyl, phenyl and tropyl.

2.1. Cyclopentadienyl

Cyclopentadienyl  (C5H5)  is  the  smallest  cyclic  species  commonly
involved in aromatic combustion processes. It is quickly and dominantly
derived  from  phenoxy  radical,  which  is  crucial  in  benzene  oxidation
[198]; it is also yielded via the combination of small hydrocarbons and
the H-loss of 1,3-cyclopentadiene (C5H6) [186]; its further addition re-
actions  produce  PAHs  [70].  Cyclopentadienyl  is  therefore  one  of  the
fundamental  species  in  aromatic  chemistry,  and  its  reaction  class  is
categorized to the name of “C5”.

2.1.1. 1,3-Cyclopentadiene decomposition and oxidation

Due to the weak C–H bond at methylene group, 1,3-cyclopentadiene
largely decomposes via the C–H bond dissociation reaction (R1) and H-
abstraction reactions (R2) producing cyclopentadienyl. Rate constants
of  R1  were  derived  using  quantum  chemical  methods  [245,246]  and
shock-tube measurements [185,186,247,248], covering the temperature
and  pressure  ranges  of  1000–2500  K  and  0.08–13  atm.  Theoretical
studies have been performed on the rate coefficient calculations of R2 –
R4,  too  [46,249,250].  H-addition  channel  (R3)  was  also  included,
because H-addition channel generally has a lower energy barrier than
H-abstraction channel [249]. Recent study of Mao et al. [46] supported
this conclusion, and recommended that R3 prefers to take place at low
temperatures  and  high  pressures.  The  H  + C5H6  reaction  also  has
bimolecular products channel of allyl and acetylene (R4), which com-
petes with R2a and R3 [251]. Djokic et al. [188] suggested the products
of R4 to be ethylene and propargyl, but the quantum calculation of Mao
et al. [46] revealed that it is negligible comparing to allyl and acetylene.

loss of cyclopentadienyl (HCCCHCCH2  + H or other C5H4  isomers) is
negligible  even  at  high  temperatures  [255].  Cyclopentadienyl  either
proceeds a decomposition route for propargyl and acetylene (R5) [56,
186,247,256,257] or a sequential route for 1-vinyl-propargyl (l-C5H5, a
linear  resonantly  stabilized  radical)  [46,256,258–260].  The  rate  co-
efficients of R5 have been measured and calculated in several studies,
covering  the  temperature  and  pressure  ranges  of  500–2500  K  and
0.01–100 atm [56,186,247,256,257]. Most recent study of Mao et al.
[257] found that the isomerization reaction from cyclopentadienyl to
cyclopentadien-1-yl via H-transfer dominates at low temperatures and
high pressures, while the well-skipping decomposition reaction towards
propargyl  and  acetylene  is  important  at  high  temperatures  and  low
pressures. Their rate coefficients have a satisfactory agreement with the
previous experimental data [56,186]. 1-Vinyl-propargyl is stabilized by
its allylic resonance. The sequential route of cyclopentadienyl was re-
ported  in  Hemberger  et  al.  [259]  by  detecting  the  trace  amount  of
1-vinyl-propargyl in the ms-TPES of m/z = 65 in the decomposition of
2-hydroxyphenyl, which can only be isomerized from cyclopentadienyl.
Similar  to  R5,  1-vinyl-propargyl  also  decomposes  to  propargyl  and
acetylene. Kinetic investigations were performed on its inverse reaction
(R6) [258,260]. Addition of acetylene to the acetylenic site of propargyl
may  form  1-vinyl-propargyl,  but  it  rapidly  rearranges  to  cyclo-
pentadienyl at combustion-relevant temperatures [258].

2.1.3. Cyclopentadienyl oxidation

The  reactions  of  cyclopentadienyl  with  O,  OH,  HO2  and  O2  are
critical  to  model  the  oxidation  of  cyclopentadienyl.  The  reaction  of
C5H5  + O  proceeds  through  an  highly  exothermic  and  barrierless  O-
atom addition step to C5H5O radical (R7), which then undergoes fast H-
migration,  ring-opening,  and  dissociation  to  produce  butadienyl
(nC4H5) and CO (R8) [251,253,261,262]. Stabilization to C5H5O con-
tributes slightly to the total product yield at low temperature and high
pressure, whereas only very minor H-elimination process is found for
cyclopentadienone  (C5H4O)  + H  (R9).  The  formation  of  1-oxopro-
p-2-enyl + acetylene from C5H5O is also negligible.

The reactions of 1,3-cyclopentadiene with O2 and other radicals (R2)
have only few studies, their rate constants mostly rely on estimations.
Alarcon  and  Mebel  [252]  recently  calculated  the  rate  constants  of  1,
3-cyclopentadiene  + O2  reaction.  Jin  et  al.  [53]  experimentally
measured the rate coefficients of C5H6 + OH (R2b) near 1.0 atm over the
temperature range of 830–1390 K. Their data show a good agreement
with the theoretical evaluations from Robinson and Lindstedt [253] and
Zhong and Bozzelli [251], with relatively stronger temperature depen-
dence.  Reaction  of  C5H6  + HO2  was  investigated  by  Xu  et  al.  [254]:
H-abstraction of C5H6  by HO2  (R2c); HO2  addition channels form the
bimolecular products of C5H7  + O2  or C5H6O + OH, via well-skipping
routes  or  via  C5H7O2  stabilization/decomposition.  The  major  con-
sumption reaction of C5H6O forms C4H6 and CO.

2.1.2. Cyclopentadienyl decomposition

The ring-opening reactions of cyclopentadienyl are competitive to its
combination reactions, and produce smaller hydrocarbons. The H-atom

The reaction of C5H5  + OH proceeds mainly via the well-skipping
pathways  instead  of  stabilizing  to  cyclopentadienol  (C5H5OH,  R10),
leading  to  the  bimolecular  products  C5H5O  + H  (R11),  C5H4OH  + H

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)1010767

H. Jin et al.

(R12), and C4H6  + CO (R13) [263]. Cyclopentadienol also further de-
composes to C5H4OH (R14) or C5H5O (R15). High pressure favors the
stabilization/dissociation and high temperature favors the well-skipping
channels. In typical flame conditions, the computed relative yields of the
well-skipping channels is around 60%, whereas 43% of the reactants are
consumed with the formation of the stabilized C5H5OH [263].

The  reaction  of  C5H5  with  HO2  has  two  channels  (R21  and  R22)
[251,253], in which R21 converts a HO2 radical to a more reactive OH
radical and is three orders of magnitude faster than R22.

H-elimination does not occur in the unimolecular decomposition of
cyclopentadienone  [265].  Its  prevailing  reaction  channel  leads  to  the
formation of the cyclobutadiene (cC4H4) + CO (R23); the channel for
vinylacetylene  (C4H4)  is  very  minor  [262].  Decomposition  of  cyclo-
pentadienone  can  be  greatly  facilitated  through  its  reaction  with
H-atoms  [262].  H-addition  to  the  ortho-  and  meta-carbons  of  cyclo-
pentadienone opens the ring and yields butadienyl + CO or 1-oxopro-
p-2-enyl  + acetylene.  The  further  oxidation  of  cyclopentadienone
proceeds  via  its  cyclopentadienone-2-yl  and  cyclopentadienone-3-yl
radicals  (C5H3O)  [266].  The  C5H3O  + O2  reactions  have  unusually
low reaction enthalpies, and show significant chain branching, forming
cyclopentadienone-2 and -3-yl alkoxy radicals (C5H3O2) and O-atom.

2.2. Phenyl

Benzene  (A1)  is  a  prototypical  aromatic  structure  in  combustion
studies.  It  has  the  simplest  periphery  type  –  “free”  (besides  “zigzag”,
“armchair”,  “cove”,  “fjord”  [267]),  and  represents  a  series  of
peri-condensed  aromatic  hydrocarbons.  Phenyl  (A1-)  is  the  dominant
radical  of  benzene  combustion  chemistry,  which  determines  its
decomposition, oxidation and PAH growth. The reaction class of phenyl
is categorized to the name of “C6”.

2.2.1. Benzene decomposition and oxidation

Due to the strong π-bonds in benzene ring, the C–H σ-bond dissoci-
ation (R24) for phenyl (A1-) is able to initiate benzene chemistry only at
high  temperature.  A  list  of  Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus  (RRKM)
calculations  obtained  the  fall-off  expressions  for  the  rate  constants  of

Oleinikov et al. [264] clarified the reaction channels of C5H5 + O2:
the bimolecular products of C5H4O + OH (R16) or C5H5O + O (R17); the
ring–opening processes towards buta-1,3-dien-1-one (H2CCHCHC(H)O)
+ CO,  vinylketene  + formyl,  5-oxopenta-2,4-dienal
(OC(H)
CHCHCHCO) + H, and 1,3-butadien-1-yl + CO2. At high temperatures,
the  C5H5  + O2  reaction  proceeds  to  various  bimolecular  products,
dominantly  C5H4O  and  minorly  C5H5O,  which  are  independent  of
pressure. At low temperatures, C5H5O2  accumulates (R18) and partici-
pates in subsequent decomposition reactions (R19 and R20). In general,
a  relatively  small  fraction  of  the  reaction  flux  undergoes  the
ring-opening  pathway:  the  formation  of  buta-1,3-dien-1-one,  vinyl-
ketene, and 5-oxopenta-2,4-dienal shows negative pressure dependence
in  the  medium  and  high-temperature  regime;  the  reaction  channel of
C5H5O2
leading  to  a  removal  of  CO2  for  1,3-butadien-1-yl  is
insignificant.

R24 [268–273]. Both Saggese et al. [198] and Yang et al. [201] sug-
gested that R24 is the most sensitive reaction in benzene pyrolysis. The
produced  H-atoms  then  drive  the  H-abstraction  reaction  of  benzene
(R25) as shown in Fig. 4. Benzene may decompose via the ring–opening
processes,  such  as  C3H3  + C3H3,  C2H2  + C4H4  and  linear  C6H5  + H
[198]. But on the contrary, their reverse reactions are usually important
for benzene formation in the combustion of hydrocarbons [272,274].

The reaction of benzene and O(3P) is also crucial in benzene com-
bustion, especially under fuel-lean and stoichiometric conditions [153].
It has the channels of addition and decomposition (R28 and R29), as well
as  the  channel  of  H-atom  removal  from  benzene  ring  (R30).  The
pressure-dependent  rate  constants  were  measured  and  calculated  for
these  reaction  channels  (R28  –  R30)  [270,282,283].  The  dominant
product  of  benzene  + O  reaction  was  phenol  (R28)  at  temperatures
below 500 K; the channels of phenoxy + H (R30) and C5H6 + CO (R29)
were  significant  at  temperatures  above  700  K  [282,283],  which  is
different from the theoretical study of Nguyen et al. [284]. R30 is a chain
branching bimolecular reaction. It is sensitive in both the leanest and
richest benzene flames [153].

As  shown  in  Fig.  4,  the  most  important  benzene  decomposition
pathways in both the leanest and richest combustion conditions are the
H-abstraction  reactions  by  H  and  OH  radicals  (R25  and  R26)  [201].
Experimental and theoretical studies about the H-abstraction reactions
of benzene have been reviewed by Baulch et al. [270] and their values
have  good consistency  in different studies  [3,276–281]. The ipso-sub-
stitution  reaction  of  A1  + OH  produces  phenol  (A1OH)  and  H-atom
(R27) [3], which plays a minor role in its oxidation.

Altarawneh et al. [285] investigated the reaction of benzene + HO2
in  the  very  early  stage  of  benzene  oxidation,  and  concluded  that  the
oxidation of benzene in the low temperature oxidation is initiated by the
addition of HO2 to the benzene ring rather than by H-abstraction of HO2.
This reaction is much faster than benzene + O2  in sustaining the low
temperature  oxidation.  However,  H-abstraction  reactions  by  O2,  HO2
and other radicals play a relatively small role in the high temperature
oxidation of benzene.

2.2.2. Phenol reactions

Phenol  is  a  critical  intermediate  in  benzene  oxidation,  and  the
simplest phenolic compound during biomass pyrolysis [286]. The main
decomposition  products  of  phenol  experimentally  detected  are  cyclo-
pentadiene and CO [192,287,288], but its detailed reaction kinetics has
long been debated. These products may form via the following reactions
of O–H bond fission (R31) or via direct molecular decomposition (R32).
No experimental evidence was in favor of either competitive C5H6 for-
mation  pathways  before  the  recent  PIMS  and  IR  (infrared  radiation
spectroscopy)  experiment  carried  out  by  Scheer  et  al.  [289]  in  a
microtubular  reactor  in  the  temperature  range  of  475–1575  K.  They
were  able  to  confirm  the  enol/keto  tautomerization  in  the  phenol
decomposition (R32) by the critical intermediate of 2,4-cyclohexadie-
none,  and  the  radical  decomposition  pathway  (R31)  is  thus  of  minor
importance. The quantum chemical investigation by Pratali Maffei et al.
[290] partially confirmed the conclusions of previous literature studies.

2.2.4. Phenyl oxidation

Fig. 4 provides a general picture of the phenyl oxidation chemistry.
In  the  reaction  of  phenyl  radicals  and  molecular  oxygen,  o-benzoqui-
none  (oC6H4O2),  the  phenoxy  radical  (C6H5O),  and  cyclopentadienyl
radical (C5H5) were primary products formed through emission  of H-
atom, O-atom and CO2 [305]. Phenylperoxy radical (A1O2) is formed via
a barrier-less addition of the phenyl radical to O2 (R38), which has three
decomposition  pathways.  Firstly,  the  terminal  peroxide  O-atom  of
phenylperoxy migrates to its ortho-site leading to o-benzoquinone (R39)
[306]. Frank et al. [307] argued that the C6H4O2 species was most likely
p-benzoquinone,  which  may  be  associated  with  a  secondary  reaction.
Secondly,  phenylperoxy  radical  involves  an  O-atom  emission  to  form
phenoxy  radical  (R40),  which  is  the  primary  reaction  product  [306,
308–312]. At low temperatures (T < 1000 K), the addition-stabilization
process producing A1O2 (R38) dominates the reaction, whereas at high
temperatures, the production of the phenoxy radical (R41) and o-ben-
zoquinone  (R42)  becomes  competitive  [308].  Finally,  phenylperoxy
radical  isomerizes  to  a  2-oxepinoxy  radical.  Theoretical  predictions
emphasized the small but critical role of the pyranyl from 2-oxepinoxy
decomposition  [306,313],  but  it  was  not  observed  in  elementary
experiment [305]. Pyranyl may quickly form cyclopentadienyl radical
via  emitting  a  CO2  molecule  (R43)  [306].  Very  recent  theoretical
investigation claimed the favorable formation of 2,4-cyclopentadienone
and HCO from 2-oxepinoxy radical (R44) at <1500 K and >1 atm [314].
R44 is suggested to be more favorable than R42 due to a lower energy
barrier of the isomerization from phenylperoxy to 2-oxepinoxy than its
O-atom migration [306,314].

decarbonylation step to the products, which lowers the TS energy bar-
rier by almost 4 kcal/mol with respect to the CCSDIJT/CBS value [289,
291]. The rate constant obtained for R32 is in general agreement with
previous theoretical and experimental studies [288]. It also highlighted
the  contribution  of  C–H  bond  fissions  from  the  2,4-C6H6O  and  2,
5-C6H6O  intermediates  to  the  formation  of  the  phenoxy  radical.  The
global  rate  constant  of  phenoxy  formation  (R31)  is  thus  twice  of  the
previous  values  [271,288,291–293].  Hence,  molecular  decomposition
of phenol to CO and C5H6  dominates over bond fission to the phenoxy
radical only below ~1400 K; the formation of phenoxy and H radicals
becomes significant at high temperature. The competition between R31
and R32 determines the main mechanism of CO formation. H-abstrac-
tion reaction of phenol by H and OH radicals (R33) are also sensitive to
the phenol combustion. The rate constants of R31 – R33 were measured
and calculated in several literature works [288,290,293–295].

2.2.3. Phenyl decomposition

The ring-opening reaction of phenyl towards 1-hexyne-3,5-dien-6-yl
radical (lC6H5) (R34) and its subsequent bond fission to C4H3  + C2H2
(R35) were recommended for phenyl decomposition [296–298]. But the
theoretical studies [299–302] suggested that the benzyne (oC6H4) + H
channel (R36) is comparable to the intermolecular rearrangement (R34)
and the reaction channels of C4H3 + C2H2 and lC6H4 + H are relatively
slow. oC6H4  then decomposes to butadiyne and acetylene (R37). With
the  pressure-dependent  rate  constants  of  R36  and  R37,  the  model  of
Wang et al. [303] was able to explain the species profiles measured by
Laskin and Lifshitz [298], as well as H-atom production rate reported in
Braun-Unkhoff  et  al.  [268].  Sivaramakrishnan  et  al.  [125]  thus  sug-
gested to include R34 – R37 in the modeling of benzene pyrolysis at 30
and 50 bar. Latest modeling study from Saggese et al. [198] revealed
that R34 and R36 were identically crucial for the phenyl decomposition
[125,298,304].  The  relative  importance  of  phenyl  decomposition  to
oC6H4  or lC6H5  is  strictly correlated to  pressure:  R36  has the  highest
sensitivity  coefficient  at  atmospheric  pressure;  R34  prevails  at  high
pressure.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107610

H. Jin et al.

The  addition  of  HO2  to  phenyl  produces  A1OOH*  adduct,  which
either stabilizes to A1OOH or decomposes to A1O + OH via the fission of
the weak O–O bond (R49). On the singlet surface, A1OOH* easily de-
composes to A1O + OH via a barrierless process; on the triplet surface,
this reaction may produce A1O + OH or A1OH + O [285].

2.3. Benzyl

Toluene  (or  benzyl)  is  the  simplest  alkyl-substituted  aromatic  hy-
drocarbon, and is the prototype of those methyl substituted aromatics,
such as methylnaphthalene (or naphthylmethyl), xylene (or xylyl), etc.
[89,123,226,234,237,324]. Different from common knowledge, a more
reasonable  understanding  of  toluene  is  a  phenyl  group  substituted
methane molecular according to its combustion kinetics, because phenyl
group  is  an  inert  moiety  of  the  toluene  molecular,  most  primary  re-
actions occur on its methyl group moiety. Benzyl radical then similarly
plays  a  role  of  “methyl  radical”  [110,208],  which  composes  “C7”
chemistry with the reactions of toluene.

2.3.1. Toluene decomposition and oxidation

Unimolecular  decomposition  of  toluene  (A1CH3)  produces  benzyl
(A1CH2),  phenyl  and  methylphenyl  (C6H4CH3)  radicals  (R50  –  R52),
respectively.  The  benzylic  C–H  bond  of  toluene  has  the  lowest  bond
dissociation energy (BDE), ~22 kcal/mol lower than those on the ring
[325]. R50 thus dominates the unimolecular decomposition reactions of
toluene [65,326,327]. The C–C bond fission (R51) requires higher en-
ergy than R50, but is favored in entropy. The rate coefficients of R50 and
R51 have been measured in shock tube by several studies [328–330],
covering  the  temperature  and  pressure  ranges  of  1350–1900  K  and
0.1–1.5  atm,  respectively.  The  calculations  of  R50  and  R51  by  Klip-
penstein et al. [65] were validated by C6D5CH3 pyrolysis [330]. Matsugi
[327]  found  remarkable  impact  of  angular  momentum  J  on  the  C–C
bond fission channel (R51) besides the commonly considered internal
energy  E,  particularly  at  low  pressures.  The  rate  constant  of  R52  is
scarce, which is commonly analogized to that of benzene.

Pressure-dependent rate constants of phenyl and molecular oxygen
reaction  were  measured  [308,315]  and  calculated  [313,316,317]  in
significantly different values, and the branching ratio of R39, R41, and
R43 remains uncertain. As shown in Fig. 5, high temperature data are
insufficient. The theoretical results of Kislov et al. [313] show a stronger
positive temperature dependence and are ~3.5 times greater than the
values  of  Zhang  et  al.  [316],  Morozov  et  al.  [314],  and  da  Silva  and
Bozzelli [317] with negligible temperature dependence (>1000 K).

Phenoxy radical decomposes to cyclopentadienyl by releasing a CO
molecule  (R45)  [313],  or  forms  phenol  by  adding  a  H-atom  (R31  in
Section 2.2.2). The former is a chain propagating reaction, whilst the
latter is a chain terminating reaction. The rate constants of R45 calcu-
lated  in  different  studies  were  close  to  each  other  and  showed  good
agreement  with  experimental  data  [307,318–321].  Shu  et  al.  [321]
recommended  a  least-squares  analysis  of  kR45:  k(T)  = 9.1  × 1013exp
(–220.3 kJmol

(cid:0) 1, with an uncertainty of ±25%.

(cid:0) 1/RT) s

Phenoxy may be oxidized by the addition of O-atom to its ortho-/
para-sites  beside  unimolecular  decomposition  [314,322,323],  which
leads  to  o-/p-benzoquinone  (R46)  [314]  or  cyclopentadiene  + CO2
[322]  but  recently  recommended  as  2,4-cyclopentadienone  + HCO
(R47) [314]. Phenylperoxy is a third choice of phenoxy + O-atom re-
action,  but  only  contributes  below  1500  K  and  above  1  atm  [314].
Benzoquinone further decomposes to C5H4O and CO (R48) [307].

H. Jin et al.

The reaction between toluene and H-atom has three channels, the H-
abstraction channels leading to benzyl (R53) and methylphenyl (R54),
and  the  ipso-substitution  channel  leading  to  benzene  (R55).  R53  is  a
major  channel,  that  has  been  studied  in  literature  works  [268,270,
331–335].  Ellis  et  al.  [336]  found  the  branching  ratio  of  R54/R53  is
about 0.1, which was supported by theoretical calculations [207,337].
R55  consumes  a  reactive  H  radical  and  produces  a  more  stable  CH3
radical, thus it is very sensitive to the ignition delay time of toluene [81].
The  rate  constants  of  R55,  although  experimental  measured  in  early
literature  works  [332,336,338],  are  nevertheless  recommended  from
the  recent  theoretical  and  modeling  results  [65,81].  Recently,  Pratali
Maffei et al. [339] suggested electronic structure based rate rules for H
ipso-reactions on mono-aromatic hydrocarbons with single and double
substituents of OH, CH3, OCH3, CHO, and C2H5.

The  reaction  of  toluene  and  O-atom  is  lacking  of  theoretical  and
experimental  investigations  up  to  now  [325,337,349].  H-abstraction
channels lead  to  benzyl (R61) and  methylphenyl  (R62) [325,337],  in
which R61 dominates for temperatures up to ~1600 K [325]. O-addition
channels were analogized from the benzene reactions [282] in toluene
models
radical
[110,208,350],  and  produce  methylphenoxy
(OC6H4CH3, R63), cresol (R64) and methylcyclopentadiene (C5H5CH3,
R65). H-abstraction reaction of toluene by HO2 (R66 and R67) works at
the low temperatures [67,325,337], and the branching ratio of R66/R67
is about 4.

H-abstraction of toluene by O2 (R56) is the primary initial reaction of
toluene, which mainly takes place at the methyl group. Rate coefficients
determined by Zhou et al. [340] and Pelucchi et al. [325] reveal very
close results, but are ten times smaller than the experimental data [341,
342].

The reaction between toluene and OH mainly involves H-abstraction
channels towards benzyl (R57) and methylphenyl (R58) and ipso-sub-
stitution  channels  towards  phenol  (R59)  and  cresol  (HOC6H4CH3)
(R60). The kinetic investigations in different studies show good agree-
ment at high temperatures [3,325,337,343–346]. Recently, Salta et al.
[347,348] revealed the route for dihydroxy species through the hydroxy
cyclohexadienyl  radical  under  lean  toluene  oxidation  condition  with
excess OH radical.

2.3.2. Benzyl decomposition

Numerous  studies  have  been  performed  on  the  decomposition  of
benzyl [65,182,209,260,326,333,341,351–365], but provided conflict-
ing interpretations of its mechanism. C5H5 + C2H2 and C3H3 + C4H4 are
proposed to be the main reaction channels [209,354], which are widely
adopted  in  aromatic  combustion  models  [127,205].  But  fulvenallene
was detected using SVUV-PIMS in toluene pyrolysis and flames [362,
366,367].  Relative  benzyl  decomposition  experiments  observed

H. Jin et al.

considerable amounts of H-atom and a C7H6  fragment with unknown
structure  [333,341,355–358],  which  however  was  proposed  to  be
formed via its isomerization to an aliphatic C7H7  radical and the sub-
sequent decomposition. The theoretical work of Cavallotti et al. [360],
for the first time, proposed that fulvenallene is the C7H6  product, and
R68 is the main pathway of benzyl decomposition. This mechanism was
recently  confirmed  by  detecting  the  PIE  (photoionization  efficiency
spectrum)  and  IR  spectroscopy  of  dominant  fulvenallene  in  benzyl
decomposition [352]. Some studies proposed another channel to ben-
zyne and CH3  (R69) besides the predominant channel to fulvenallene
(R68), but R69 priorly requires an isomerization from benzyl to meth-
ylphenyl  [182,360,364].  The  rate  coefficients  of  R68  and  R69  were
measured in the shock tube [333,356,359,363,368]. We recommend the
values of Matsugi [368], which locate in the middle of the experimental
and  theoretical  values  [182,333,356,359,360,363].  The  chemically
activated  process  (R70)  is  also  critical  [65,326],  although  it  usually
works as a benzyl formation pathway from phenyl in flames.

Successive  investigations  on  the  C7H7  kinetics  [260,352,353,361,
369] revealed that C5H5 + C2H2 reaction mainly formed tropyl (tC7H7,
R72) at low-temperature in addition to R71. Benzyl is not preferred to
isomerize to tropyl, and vice versa [260,352,353]. Johansson et al. [370]
illustrated the crucial role of vinyl-cyclopentadienyl (vC7H7, Fig. 6a) in
the  aromatic  chemistry,  but  this  vC7H7  RSR  is  still  ignored  in  the
modeling work nowadays. Propargyl and vinylacetylene react via R73
and  R74  [371]  yielding  vinyl-cyclopentadienyl  and  fulvenallene,
respectively.  Vinyl-cyclopentadienyl  is  attained  very  rapidly  and  may
also transform to fulvenallene in a single H-loss step. Jin et al. [351]
experimentally observed comparable amount of vinyl-cyclopentadienyl
and  fulvenallene  in  the  propargyl  and  vinylacetylene  reaction,  which
revealed the significance of R73 at around 1000 K.

The further reaction between H-atom and fulvenallene leads to the
production  of  acetylene  and  cyclopentadienyl  (R71)  [182].  Detilleux
and Vandooren [362] found that their measurements of C7H7 and C7H6
may be very well reproduced by including R68 and R71 from Cavallotti
et al. [360]. 1-Ethynylcyclopentadiene (eC7H6) is the isomer of fulve-
nallene.  Its  reaction  with  H-atom  also  yields  cyclopentadienyl  and
acetylene (R71) [361,369].

Summarily,  other  two  C7H7  RSRs,  vinyl-cyclopentadienyl  (vC7H7)
and tropyl, at least are involved in the reaction kinetics of benzyl radical
[260,351–353]. Fig. 6a clearly illustrates the reaction scheme of these
C7H7  RSRs.  Due  to  the  slow  isomerization  between  each  other  [260,
351–353], the reaction scheme of C7H7 RSRs is centered at fulvenallene
(C7H6)  through  H-elimination/addition  reactions  [351].  Recently,
Reilly et al. [372] also suggested 3-ethynylcyclopentenyl to be crucial in
C7 chemistry. Jin et al. [351] concluded that C7H7 PES may be divided

H. Jin et al.

illustrated  that  benzaldehyde  was  yielded  via  a  1,3-H-migration  of
A1CH2O2 and a subsequent cleavage of O–O bond cleavage. But Pelucchi
et al. [325] suggested a well-skipping bimolecular reaction (R83) was
dominant over R80 – R82. The branching ratio for benzaldehyde, either
via R81 or R83, is 0.87–0.96 under all combustion conditions.

into several sub-zones by different C7H7  RSRs (Fig. 6). Each C7H7  RSR
has  its  isolated  sub-network  of  reactions  with  weak  direct  in-
terconversions with others. They have isolated entrance channels, C6 +
C1  reactions for benzyl, C5  + C2  reactions for tropyl, and C3  + C4  re-
actions  for  vinyl-cyclopentadienyl;  they  also  have  isolated  further  re-
actions [369], which generally lack investigations except benzyl.

Quantum  chemical  studies  suggest  that  fulvenallene  proceeds
through  low  barrier  C–H  bond  cleavage  (R75)  and  H-abstraction  re-
actions by H, OH and CH3  radicals (R76) for the generation of fulve-
nallenyl  under  combustion  condition  [183,373–376],  as  shown  in
Fig. 6a. Successive studies [183,364] revealed the intersystem crossing
to the triplet C7H6  PES leading to cyclopentadienylidene (cC5H4) and
C2H2 (R77). R76 and R77 are feasible to happen in identical probability
under normal conditions, but R77 is favored at high temperatures and
pressures [183]. Recent studies even propose the reactions of benzene
and C-atom/CH radical for fulvenallene formation [377,378].

Two fulvenallenyl decomposition channels are worth investigating

in “C7”-chemistry: C4H2 + C3H3 (R78) and nC5H3 (CHCC
HCCH)/iC5H3
•
H) + C2H2 (R79). Jin et al. [379] validated the reaction ki-
(CH2CCCC
netics of R78 in SVUV-PIMS experiment. da Silva et al. [374] detected a
mass peak at m/z = 63 in the pyrolysis of phthalide, which revealed the
possibility  of  C5H3  radicals  from  the  decomposition  of  fulvenallenyl
(R79). Theoretical studies [364,374,380,381] concluded R78 is about
an order of magnitude faster than R79 in a wide pressure range from
0.013 to 10 atm.

The  reaction  of  benzyl  and  hydroxyl  produces  benzyl  alcohol
(A1CH2OH)  (R84)  [384].  Benzyl  alcohol  subsequently  decomposes  to
benzoxy (A1CH2O) or A1CHOH radicals, which both leads to benzalde-
hyde (A1CHO). Because of the fully conjugated molecular structure of
benzyl, OH radical may be attached to the ortho-site; feasible isomeri-
zation thus yields o-cresol (HOC6H4CH3, R85) [347].

The reaction of benzyl and O-atom yields benzaldehyde + H (R86)
and  benzene  + formyl  (HCO)  (R87)  via  an  intermediate  of  benzoxy
radical  [385–387].  PES  indicates  phenyl  and  formaldehyde  are  the
products of R87, but a roaming mechanism of C6H5H....CHO complex
converted them to benzene and formyl (R87) [385]. The branching ra-
tios of R86 and R87 are around 0.32 and 0.58 at 2000 K. Debates on the
products  of  R87  require  further  experimental  and  theoretical  in-
vestigations.  Minor  products  of  benzyl  and  O-atom  reaction  are
o-/p-quinone methide, which may occupy ~10% of production.

2.3.3. Benzyl oxidation

The  oxidation  of  benzyl  proceeds  through  many  reactions  with
common combustion intermediates, such as O2, OH, O, HO2, etc., which
are expected to establish the radical pool of “C7” combustion chemistry.
The  entrance  channel  of  benzyl  and  O2  reaction  (R80)  is  exothermic
[325],  but  the  relatively  unstable  benzylperoxy  radical  is  likely  to
decompose back to the reactants different from the successive isomeri-
zation of alkylperoxy radicals. Benzylperoxy radical has slow forward
dissociation  reactions:  benzaldehyde  (A1CHO)  + OH  (R81),  and  phe-
noxy  + formaldehyde  (R82).  Several  studies  [66,347,382,383]

The  reaction  of  A1CH2  and  HO2  is  crucial  at  low-to-intermediate
temperature range [350,388–390]. At low temperatures, the activated
adduct stabilizes to benzylhydroperoxide (A1CH2OOH) (R88); benzoxy

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107614

H. Jin et al.

+ OH (R89) becomes significant at 800 K and above [390]. Other pro-
duction  channels  include  benzaldehyde  + H2O,  benzyne  + formalde-
hyde + H2O, and hydroxybenzyl + OH [390].

Benzoxy  radical  predominantly  decomposes  to  benzaldehyde
(A1CHO) + H (R90), benzene + formyl (R91) and phenyl + formalde-
hyde [64]. Experimental study revealed that benzene and benzaldehyde
are the main products, while phenyl radical was not observed [391]. The
roaming channel (R87) converts A1- + CH2O to A1 + HCO [385].

Modeling study of benzaldehyde oxidation recommended its quick
decomposition  to  benzoyl  radical  (A1CO)  through  C–H  bond  fission
(R92), H-abstraction reaction (R93), and ipso-reaction (R94) [383,392,
393]. Experimental data and theoretical calculations are not sufficient
for  these  reactions  [270,394–397].  The  rate  constants  in  models  are
generally based on estimation.

2.3.4. Methylphenyl reactions

Around  21%  of  toluene  was  converted  to  methylphenoxy  radical
(C6H4CH3) in the stoichiometric oxidation of toluene at 12.5 atm and
920  K [205], because of the stronger  phenyl ring C–H BDEs. Methyl-
phenyl has three isomers, o-methylphenyl (oC6H4CH3), m-methylphenyl
(mC6H4CH3),  and  p-methylphenyl  (pC6H4CH3).  Methylphenyl  radicals
are more reactive than benzyl with higher energies of ~23 kcal/mol [3,
402], p-methylphenyl is the most reactive among them [3]. Dames and
Wang  [402]  revealed  that  the  isomerization  between  m-/p-methyl-
phenyl  and  benzyl  is  not  accessible.  Such  isomerization  is  only  ener-
getically preferred from o-methylphenyl to benzyl, at least 20 kcal/mol
lower than other possibilities, such as the dissociation to benzyne + CH3
and 3-methylbenzyne + H [402]. At the combustion temperature higher
than 1500 K, methylphenyl may challenge the dominance of benzyl in
the H-abstraction reactions of toluene [325]. Besides the short life time
of o-methylphenyl at only several microseconds, m- and p-methylphenyl
radicals have a substantially longer lifetime, driving them to the bimo-
lecular reactions with O2, etc. [402]. However, the reactions of meth-
ylphenyl were commonly neglected in combustion models, and limited
experimental or theoretical studies are available for methylphenyl rad-
icals [38,403–405].

Theoretical  calculation  and  crossed  molecular  beam  experiment
reveal  that  the  reaction  of  p-methylphenyl  and  O2  rapidly  forms  p-
methylphenoxy radical + O (R98) [403]. The reaction dynamic of this
reaction is almost the same as phenyl + O2 in which methyl group is a
spectator  during  this  process.  The  position  of  methyl  group  at  ortho-,
meta-, or para-site does not impact the significance of R98 in methyl-
phenyl oxidation [38]. Methylphenyl radicals may also react with OH, O
and HO2  to produce methylphenoxy radicals. Rate constants for these
reactions were mostly estimated from the similar reactions of phenyl,
because no theoretical or experimental results are reported up to now.

Benzoyl  quickly  decomposes  to  phenyl  and  CO  (R95)  [398,399].
Present studies were limited to a low temperature region, whilst lacking
of the data at combustion condition. Benzoyl oxidizes via the reactions
with  O-atom  (R96)  and  O2  (R97).  R97  forms  a  chemically  activated
benzoylperoxy adduct, which leads to the highly exothermic products of
phenoxy  and  CO2  (R97)  [400,401].  But  R97  is  usually  preferred  at
low-temperature oxidation.

Prendergast et al. [404,405] and da Silva et al. [38] also suggested
the importance of ring-open reaction channel via the methyloxepinoxy
intermediates,  especially  at  low  and  medium  temperature  region.
Methyl-cyclopentadienone
(OC5H3CH3)
cyclopentadienone
(C5H4O) are the products of this reaction channel (R99) [405]. In the
ortho-radical case, 7-methyloxepinoxy produces cyclopentadienone and
3-methyloxepinoxy  produces  2-methyl-cyclopentadienone.  In  the  met-
a-radical case, 4- and 6-methyloxepinoxy produces 2- and 3-methyl-cy-
clopentadienone.  No  literature  has  reported  the  para-radical  case,
however  3-methyl-cyclopentadienone  may  be  the  product  inferring
from the results of da Silva et al. [38].

and

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107615

H. Jin et al.

At low temperatures, the entrance adduct of oC6H4CH3  + O2  stabi-
lizes  to  o-methylphenylperoxy,  which  turns  to  o-hydroperoxybenzyl
radical via intramolecular H-transfer. o-Quinone-methide (OC6H4CH2)
and OH are formed though O–O bond fission of the hydroperoxyl group
(R100) [38].

is  therefore  the  most  energetically  favorable  pathway  for  styrene
decomposition  [410].  Styrene  also  decomposes  to  phenylacetylene
(R106) overcoming an energy barrier of 94.7 kcal/mol. Isomerization
from o-xylylene (oC8H8) to styrene is also possible via the intermediate
of  benzocyclobutene.  The  decomposition  of  o-xylylene  produces  ben-
zyne and ethylene [226,411].

The  decomposition  of  methylphenoxy  radical  yields  methyl-
cyclopentadienyl radical (C5H4CH3) + CO (R101), subsequent H-loss of
methylcyclopentadienyl  produces  fulvene  or  benzene.  Carstensen  and
Dean [406] investigated the impact of substitution on the CO elimina-
tion from phenoxy, and found that methyl substitution essentially did
not  change  the  energy  barrier  of  CO  elimination.  o-Methylphenoxy
radical also decomposes to o-quinone methide via o-hydroxybenzyl in-
termediate. By the way, H-addition reaction converts methylphenoxy to
cresols,  which  shows  strong  positive  sensitivity  to  the  ignition  delay
time of toluene at high pressure due to the conversion from HO2 to O2
[205].

2.4. Styrene and phenylacetylene

Styrene (A1C2H3) and phenylacetylene (A1C2H) are high concentra-
tion intermediates in the combustion of aromatic hydrocarbons [110,
112,148,150,151,239,241,407] and biomass [408]. Similar to the way
we recognize toluene, styrene/phenylacetylene are phenyl substituted
ethylene/acetylene. In an extensive view, the reaction kinetics of styrene
and  phenylacetylene  are  the  prototypes  for  not  only  the  vinyl-  and
ethynyl-aromatics but also those aromatics with double and triple bonds
at the α-site of their substituents, namely “C8” chemistry.

2.4.1. Styrene and phenylacetylene decomposition

Styrene has very strong C–C and C–H bonds, as shown in Table 2. It
decomposes via bond dissociation reactions (R102 – R104), producing
phenyl, 1-phenylvinyl (A1CCH2) and 2-phenylvinyl (A1CHCH) radicals.
Wang  and  Frenklach  [300]  evaluated  their  pressure-dependent  rate
constants using RRKM calculations.

The H-abstraction reactions of styrene (R107) produce the 1-phenyl-
vinyl,  2-phenylvinyl  and  vinylphenyl  (C6H4C2H3)  radicals  [114].
Vinylphenyl  radical  may  be  as  important  as  1-  and  2-phenylvinyl,
because of the similar BDE and the larger amounts of C–H sites on the
benzene  ring.  Ipso-substitution  reactions  of  styrene  yield  benzene  +
vinyl (R108) or phenyl + ethylene (R109) [114].

Phenylacetylene  has  a  very  strong  C–C  bond  between  the  ethynyl
substituent and benzene ring (140.14 kcal/mol in Table 2) and a very
strong  C–H  bond  on  its  ethynyl  group  (133.70  kcal/mol  in  Table  2).
Phenylacetylene is almost not able to dissociate through the dissociation
of these two bonds, on the contrary, the reverse reactions of phenyl +
ethynyl and phenylethynyl + H are considered as the phenylacetylene
formation pathways. The C–H bond strengths in the phenyl moiety are
close to those in benzene (112.9 kcal/mol in Table 2). Therefore, only
ethynylphenyl radical is favored in the unimolecular decomposition of
phenylacetylene  (R110).  For  the  rate  constant  of  R110,  Herzler  and
Frank [412] evaluated it at 2 atm in a shock tube study; Sun et al. [49]
provided its estimation at 20 atm.

Styrene  produces  vinylidene  (H2CC)  and  benzene  (R105)  via  a
concerted  equilibration  with  [4.1.0]-7-methylene-cycloheptadiene
[409,410]. R105 has a maximum energy barrier of 84.9 kcal/mol, and

Beside  the  H-abstraction  of  phenylacetylene  (R111)  [300],  ipso--
reaction  (R112)  on  the  contrary  dominates  the  bimolecular  reaction
between phenylacetylene and H-atom [412]. According to the study of
Herzler and Frank [412], R111 takes a branching ratio less than 20%.
The reverse reaction of R112 is the crucial step of the HACA mechanism,
which therefore receives extensive investigations [69,276,299,300,413,
414]. Another ipso-reaction forms benzene and ethynyl (R113), but at-
tracts comparatively less attention [300].

H. Jin et al.

benzofuran  at  low  temperature  oxidation  [114].  Meng  et  al.  [415]
suggested  the dominance of  R118  and the  sensitivity of R120  for the
flame speed of styrene.

2.4.2. Styrene oxidation

Almost no experimental or theoretical studies were performed on the
elementary reactions of styrene oxidation. Literature modeling studies
[114,204]  have  proposed  its  reaction  scheme  based  on  alkenes,  as
shown  in  Fig.  7.  In  the  high  temperature  oxidation  of  styrene,
H-abstraction reactions (R107) consume almost 40% of styrene, mainly
by OH [114]. Other reaction channels of styrene + OH produce phenol
(R114) and benzyl (R116) [114,204]. R114 is an ipso-reaction on the
benzene ring, an uncommon ipso-reaction may occur on the double bond
of the vinyl group (R115, similar as R109). OH addition to β-C-atom of
the vinyl group (R116) yields benzyl and formaldehyde via H-transfer
from hydroxyethyl to ethoxy and subsequent β-scission; OH addition to
α-C-atom of the vinyl group (R117) yielding benzaldehyde + methyl and
phenyl + acetaldehyde is not included in current models [114,204,214].
Due to the “benzyl” resonance structure of 2-phenyl-1-hydroxy-eth-2-yl
adduct, R116 may be a more favorable OH addition pathway than R117.
The addition reaction of O-atom to the vinyl group of styrene is shown in
Fig. 7. Analogizing to 1,3-butadiene, Yuan et al. [114] proposed that this
reaction  may  produce  benzyl  + formyl  (R118),  phenylvinoxy
(A1CHCHO)  + H  (R119)  and  2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-3-yl  radical
(C8H7O)  + H  (R120).  The  decomposition  of  phenylvinoxy  forms  the
benzyl connecting to the reaction scheme of “C7”. R118 and R119 thus
control the formation of the benzyl radical in styrene oxidation [114].
H-elimination of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-3-yl explains the formation of

Among C8H7 radicals derived from styrene, the carbon flux to 1-phe-
nylvinyl is about two and ten times higher than those of 2-phenylvinyl
and vinylphenyl (C6H4C2H3), respectively. Most of 1- and 2-phenylvinyl
converts  to  phenylacetylene  in  combustion,  the  rest  bimolecular  re-
actions of 1- and 2-phenylvinyl with O2  produces benzoyl and benzo-
furan, respectively [416]. Vinylphenyl may be oxidized by O2  to form
o-benzoquinone and vinyl [307], but one also argues that a small portion
may form benzofuran via the following reaction sequence of R121 and
R122 [417,418]. The reactions between C8H7  radicals and O-atom are
discussed only in styrene combustion models [114], but no experimental
or theoretical investigation has been reported up to now.

acetylene. Hollow arrows indicate those reactions involving C-elimination.

Suzuki  et  al.  [418]  proposed  a  reaction  scheme  for  benzofuran  in
combustion.  Unimolecular  decomposition  of  benzofuran  is  proposed
from the reaction of furan, leading to benzyne + ketene (R123) [419]
and  the  ring-opening  diradical  –  O
H  (R124)  [417].

H-activated reactions yield benzyl + CO (R125) [418] and phenoxy +
acetylene  (R126)  [420].  H-addition  to  benzofuran  forms  (2-hydrox-
yphenyl)-2-vinyl  radical  (HOC6H4CHCH,  R127),  which  is  also  the
combination product of hydroxyphenyl and acetylene [417]. H-transfer
achieves  the  isomerization  between  (2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-vinyl  and
2-vinyl-phenoxy (OC6H4C2H3).

via multiple barriers are collected in this section. The reaction of methyl
and cyclopentadienyl (R131 – R134) contributes to benzene formation,
as  shown  in  Fig.  8.  Experimental  measurement  [248]  and  theoretical
calculations [275,423–425] have been carried out for C5H5  + CH3  re-
action, revealing PES and rate constants. The initial reaction R131 leads
to methylcyclopentadienyl (C5H4CH3) + H; further reaction of methyl-
cyclopentadienyl  forms  benzene  (R132)  and  fulvene  (fC6H6,  R133);
fulvene then isomerizes to benzene under H-atom catalysis (R134) [423,
426–428]. Kinetical analyses of the C5H5 + CH3 reaction reveals that: a)
fulvene  and  benzene  formation  prevail  at  high  and  low  pressures
respectively;  b)  R132  and  R133  compete  at  intermediate  pressures
(1–10 atm), and fulvene formation is preferable at temperatures above
1600  K  [275].  A  “C5”  can  be  efficiently  transformed  into  “C6”  by
methylation  and  corroborate  the  potentially  important  role  of  the
methyl radical in the mechanism of aromatic growth [50,234,237], e.g.
indenyl to naphthalene [429].

2.4.3. Phenylacetylene oxidation

The OH addition reaction to phenylacetylene was only studied in an
experiment over 298–423 K [421]. Phenylacetylene reacting with OH
and O may proceed to ketenyl (HCCO), benzene, and phenyl (R128 and
R129)  [114,204].  Suzuki  et  al.  [418]  proposed  the  formation  of
benzofuran from the reaction of phenylacetylene and OH (R130). The
rate constants of these reactions were estimated from similar acetylene
reactions  [114,422].  Ethynylphenyl  is  the  most  abundant  radical
derived from phenylacetylene, but its further oxidation is not commonly
considered in kinetic models.

The recombination reactions of benzyl and methyl has by-product
channels besides the dominant ethylbenzene channel, including 1-phe-
nylethyl (A1CHCH3) + H, 2-phenylethyl (A1CH2CH2) + H, and phenyl

2.5. Mutual conversion among fundamental structures

Besides  the  easy  conversions  introduced  in  the  above  sections,
several mutual conversion pathways between “C5”, “C6”, “C7”, and “C8”

“C8”. Black, red, blue, and magenta arrows show the reaction with C1, C2, C3
and H.

+ ethyl [211,430]. The phenylethyl isomers yield styrene via C–H bond
β-scission. Styrene is also proposed to be formed from the reaction of
cyclopentadienyl  and  propargyl  (R135)  [155,428,431]  illustrating  a
critical pathway from “C5” to “C8”, but this reaction may have a limited
efficiency. Sharma et al. [428] found multiple wells in the reaction PES,
including  a  difficult  penta-ring  H-transfer  with  higher  energy  barrier
than the reactants. Similar to R131, the delocalized electrons assist the
ring enlargement from penta-to hexa-ring. Slavinskaya et al. [431] thus
proposed the reaction products of cyclopentadienyl and propargyl to be
C8H7  radical  + H  (R136).  C8H7  radical  subsequently  decomposes  to
phenylacetylene.

The  reactions  of  vinyl-cyclopentadienyl  and  tropyl  are  rarely
included  in  the  current  aromatic  models  [50,234,237],  such  as  their
conversion to “C8”. The proposed isomerization between ethylbenzene
and  methylcycloheptatriene  (cC7H7CH3)  has  a  high  energy  barrier
[430];  the  interconversion  from  methyltropyl  (cC7H6CH3)  to  styrene
(R137) is easier following the initial 1,2-H-transfer from methyltropyl to
tropylmethyl [432]. Indeed, it is possible to conjecture that combustion
pathways that conventionally go through tropyl could be significantly
different  from  an  additional  methyl  group.  For  example,  cyclo-
pentadienyl + propyne (R138) or methylcyclopentadienyl + acetylene
(R139) reactions might proceed easily to styrene through the interme-
diate of methyltropyl. Reilly et al. [432] also emphasized the isomeri-
zation  between  methyltropyl  and  o-/p-xylyl  (R140,  o/pCH3C6H4CH2),
which is a branching channel of R137 after the initial 1,2-H-transfer.

2.6. Distinct combustion characteristics of fundamental aromatic
structures

Recognizing the importance of the “C5”  –  “C8”  fundamental struc-
tures in the aromatic combustion system, plenty of experimental studies

have been carried out in the past decades on cyclopentadiene, benzene,
toluene,  styrene  and  phenylacetylene.  Due  to  the  distinct  molecular
structures, the combustion of “C5”  –  “C8”  obviously behaves different
from  each  other.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  the  distinct  combustion
characteristics of “C5” – “C8” based on the literature experimental data
and  kinetic  modeling  results.  The  model  performed  in  this  review  is
provided  in  the  Supplementary  Materials  (SMM2  –  5).  Fundamental
aromatic  chemistry,  that  described  in  Sections  2.1–2.5,  is  certainly
included in this model, as well as those of monocyclic and polycyclic
aromatics  to  be  introduced  in  the  following  sections.  The  provided
model  is  comprehensively  validated  against  various  literature  experi-
mental  data,  including  speciation  and  global  combustion  parameters
covering  wide  ranges  of  temperature  (400–2100  K)  and  pressure
(0.04–50 atm).

2.6.1. Speciation

Speciation  usually  includes  two  diagnostic  objectives;  molecular
identification  and  concentration  quantification.  Speciation  measure-
ments therefore can reveal the detailed combustion processes of cyclo-
pentadiene,  benzene,  toluene,  styrene  and  phenylacetylene.  In  this
section,  reaction  kinetics  that  proposed  for  “C5”  –  “C8”  fundamental
aromatic  structures  are  confirmed  by  various  speciation  experiments.
Such  experiments  help  to  figure  out  the  most  critical  combustion  in-
termediates  and  the  most  sensitive  reaction  pathways  under  wide
combustion conditions.

Previous studies reported a series of species in the pyrolysis [185,
186,188,189,433] and oxidation [190,261] of 1,3-cyclopentadiene, no
flame  data  has  been  published  up  to  now  (SMM1,  Table  S1).  The
decomposition  of  1,3-cyclopentadiene  and  cyclopentadienyl  is  quite
simple  (Section  2.1),  and  the  PAH  growth  pathways  from  cyclo-
pentadienyl  are  introduced  in  Section  5.  Herein,  we  focus  on  the
oxidation  of  1,3-cyclopentadiene.  Several  kinetic  models,  including
Yuan et al. [208], Wang et al. [190], Djokic et al. [188], and Aramco 3.0
[434], were compared in the prediction of 1,3-cyclopentadiene oxida-
tion at φ = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.8 under atmospheric pressure [190]. After the
formation of cyclopentadienyl, O and HO2 reactions are dominant in the
further oxidation [261], whilst O2  reaction make a minor contribution
[190]. 2,4-Cyclopentadienoxy seems to be the critical intermediate in
this  process,  which  further  decomposes  to  nC4H5  + CO  or  cyclo-
pentadienone. Yuan et al. [208] suggested the dominant consumption
pathway  of  cyclopentadienyl  to  be  the  reaction  with  O2,  yielding  2,
4-cyclopentadienone  instead  of  2,4-cyclopentadienoxy.  2,4-Cyclo-
pentadienone then decomposes to C4H4 + CO or reacts with H-atom to
form nC4H5 + CO. Wang et al. [190] further argued a global reaction of
C5H5  + HO2  yielding C4H4  + HCO and iC4H5  + CO. Unfortunately, 2,
4-cyclopentadienoxy  and  cyclopentadienone  are  not  quantitatively
measured  in  experiments,  and  the  mole  fractions  of  vinylacetylene
measured  by  Butler  and  Glassman  [261]  were  not  reproduced  in  the
modeling  work  of  Wang  et  al.  [190].  So,  further  investigations  are
required  to  clarify  this  crucial  oxidation  kinetics  of  cyclopentadienyl,
such as the branching ratios of cyclopentadienyl reactions with O, O2
and HO2, and the detailed reaction channels of C5H5 + HO2.

Table S2 (SMM1) summarizes the experimental measurements of the
benzene combustion species in pyrolysis [125,201,298,304,435–437],
oxidation  [108,135,191,192,388,438–442],  and  flames  [147,153,202,
203,443–448]. Numerous kinetic models were developed for benzene
combustion [108,153,191–202,208]. The model of Saggese et al. [198]
was validated against a vast amount of experimental data; the model of
Yuan et al. [208] well predicted the shock tube pyrolysis [231] and JSR
oxidation [108]; the model of Yang et al. [153] had good performance in
the  prediction  of  premixed  flames  at  the  stoichiometric  ratio  varying
from lean to rich [153,448]. Due to the high activation energy to open
the benzene ring, the C–H bond dissociation to produce phenyl is the
most favorite unimolecular decomposition pathway of benzene at the
investigated temperature region (1400–2000 K). The produced H atoms
then drive the H-abstraction reaction, converting benzene to phenyl. As

the temperature increases, phenyl tends to be consumed by the β-C-H
scission  reaction  for  benzyne.  The  ring-opening  of  benzyne  produces
great  amounts  of  acetylene  and  butadiyne,  making  them  the  major
benzene pyrolysis products at temperatures higher than 1600 K. Under
the oxidation condition (10 atm and φ = 1.0), over 60% of benzene is
converted to phenyl radical through H-abstraction of OH, which later
yields phenoxy radical and benzoquinone; the rest of benzene also forms
phenoxy radical besides phenol. In the previous experiments, benzyne
and phenol were commonly measured [135,153,201,202,298,440–446,
448],  but  phenyl  and  phenoxy  were  quantitatively  measured  by
SVUV-PIMS  only  [443,445,446].  Benzoquinone  is  somewhat  uninten-
tionally ignored, its concentration in premixed benzene flame was re-
ported by Bittner and Howard [443] at 1980s. Phenoxy radical is then
consumed through decarbonylation reaction yielding cyclopentadienyl
and CO. Benzoquinone is totally converted to 2,4-cyclopentadiene-1-one
via  similar  decarbonylation  processes.  Therefore,  the  combustion
chemistry of “C6” is well merged with that of “C5” through these crucial
reaction steps.

Numerous  speciation  measurements  were  performed  on  the  com-
bustion of toluene, including concentration profiles of species in pyrol-
[110,126,127,209–212,268,328,329,354,366,436,449–452],
ysis
oxidation [79,109,110,128,129,136–139,191,205,418,442] and flames
[148,206,362,367,453] (SMM1, Table S3). Several kinetic models were
proposed for the combustion of toluene [79,103,109,110,129,204–208,
211,212,436], particularly the model of Yuan et al. [103,110,208] was
comprehensively validated against various data of speciation, ignition
delay time, laminar burning velocity and extinction strain rate. In py-
rolysis,  unimolecular  decomposition  reactions  play  a  major  role  in
toluene consumption; H-abstraction reactions become more important
with  the  increasing  temperature;  the  ipso-substitution  reaction  is  not
sensitive to temperature which consumes 15% of toluene. In oxidation,
H-abstraction reactions of H, OH and O take the main role in toluene
decomposition, the ipso-substitution and the O-atom reactions are minor
forming OC6H4CH3 and HOC6H4CH3 [110,208]. Chain propagation re-
actions  rely  on  the  radicals  provided  by  chain  initiation  reactions.
Unimolecular  decomposition  reactions  of  toluene  decrease  their
contribution with pressure raise, which create the strong pressure effect
in toluene combustion. Pressure also changes the reactions of benzyl.
Under atmospheric pressure, only 20% of benzyl is oxidized by O-atom
yielding A1CH2O, the major portion undergoes the reverse reaction for
toluene or isomerize to methylphenyl. The oxidation efficiency of benzyl
is improved at high pressure. It is mainly oxidized by O-atom and HO2
producing A1CH2O at 10 atm. A1CHO + H is a more preferable A1CH2O
decomposition pathway at both low and high pressures than A1 + HCO
and  A1-  + CH2O.  Benzaldehyde  is  thus  a  crucial  intermediate  in  the
oxidation of toluene, observed in many experiments [79,109,205,206,
416]. Kinetic modelling analysis revealed the critical role of the reaction
of C6H4CH3 + O2 in the JSR oxidation of toluene at 1 and 10 atm [110,
208].  Methylphenyl  reacts  with  O2  producing  C6H4O2  + CH3  and
OC6H4CH3 + O. The previous reaction is slightly more preferable, which
converts the “C7”  to “C6”  chemistry. OC6H4CH3  is almost totally con-
verted to C5H4CH3  and CO, in which C5H4CH3  is a benzene precursor.
But OC6H4CH3 radical has up to now not been experimentally detected
in the combustion of toluene in any literature studies. Meanwhile, ful-
venallene was measured in toluene flames [362,367], but the reaction
pathways from benzyl to fulvenallene and its further products do not
attract much attention in the literature investigation [362].

Very limited speciation measurements were performed in the com-
bustion  of  styrene  and  phenylacetylene,  including  pyrolysis  [49,213,
409],  oxidation  [114]  and  flame  [114].  Decomposition  to  phenyl-
acetylene is always important for styrene: the mole fraction of phenyl-
acetylene in the rich condition is twice the value in the lean condition
[114]; 30–60% of styrene converts to phenylacetylene from lean to rich
oxidation,  due  to  the  β-C-H  scission  reactions  of  the  two  phenylvinyl
radicals.  But  no  experimental  data  is  currently  available  to  directly
reveal the oxidation process of phenylacetylene. As recommended in the

model of Yuan et al. [114], phenylacetylene reactions with H, OH and O
convert it to phenyl radical of “C6” chemistry. Benzaldehyde is a critical
intermediate in the combustion of styrene, its concentration decreases
by about a factor of two from the lean condition to the rich condition
[114].  Benzaldehyde  is  mainly  formed  via  the  following  reaction
sequence  A1C2H3  →  A1CH2  →  A1CHO  under  both  the  lean  and  rich
conditions, which connects the chemistry between “C8” and “C7”. Two
O-atom attack reactions are sensitive in this reaction sequence (R118
and  R86).  Because  the  formation  of  the  O-atoms  depends  on  the  re-
actions of O2 with phenyl, vinyl, or H-atom, the relatively low concen-
tration  of  O2  in  the  rich  flames  limits  the  efficiency  of  benzaldehyde
formation.  Benzofuran  is  also  abundantly  formed  in  the  oxidation  of
styrene, Yuan et al. [114] quantified the concentration of benzofuran in
their  JSR  experiment.  Its  formation  temperature  is  very  close  to  the
initial decomposition temperature of styrene, revealing its link to the
initial oxidation stage of styrene.

2.6.2.

Ignition, propagation, and extinction

Macro  combustion phenomena,  such as ignition,  propagation, and
extinction,  correlate  to  the  basic  combustion  characteristics  of  aro-
matics. Among them, ignition delay time is controlled by the detailed
oxidation  chemistry  of  fuel  and  thus  directly  reflect  fuel  oxidation
reactivity. Fig. 9 presents the experimental results and theoretical pre-
dictions of the ignition delay times for cyclopentadiene [454], benzene
[95,191],  toluene  [76–81,95,205,455],  and  styrene  [214].  For  the
ignition  of  cyclopentadiene,  H-abstraction  of  cyclopentadiene  by  OH
and  the  oxidation  of  cyclopentadienyl radical  by  O,  OH  and  HO2  are
most important reactions [454]. The reactions, that form or consume the
RSR phenoxy radical, play critical roles in the ignition of benzene, e.g.
H-abstraction reaction of phenol by OH strongly inhibits the benzene
oxidation [191]. For the ignition of toluene, the reaction of benzyl and
O2 is sensitive at high pressure [80], and the reaction of benzyl and HO2
is sensitive at low temperature [95]. The ignition of styrene is different,
thermal  decomposition  steps  of  styrene,  such  as  O-atom  reaction
yielding benzyl + HCO and H-atom reaction yielding phenyl + C2H4,
influence  the  consequent  autoignition  [214].  Summarily,  besides
H-abstraction  reactions,  the  RSR  reactions  with  O,  OH  and  HO2  play
significant  roles  in  the  aromatic  ignition.  Unfortunately,  the  experi-
mental data of cyclopentadiene, benzene, toluene, and styrene in Fig. 9
were not  measured at  the  identical  conditions, i.e.  different fuel  con-
centrations,  diluting  gases  and  ratios.  In  literature  studies,  C5  –  C8
chemistry was not recognized as a whole fundamental reaction system of
aromatic combustion. A comparative discussion is thus difficult to pro-
vide on their ignition processes corelating to the chemical kinetics of
fundamental aromatic structures, which requires future investigations.
Numerous experiments have been performed for the laminar flame
speeds of aromatics [100,103,106,107,214,415,456–462]. Fig. 10 pre-
sents  the  experimental  laminar  flame  speeds  of  cyclopentadiene
measured by Ji et al. [456], benzene and toluene measured by Wang
et al. [103], and laminar flame speeds of styrene measured by Coman-
dini et al. [214]. The laminar flame speeds of benzene are faster than
those  of  cyclopentadiene  and  toluene.  The  reactions  of  fuel-specific
species,  such  as  phenyl,  cyclopentadienyl,  and  benzyl,  largely  deter-
mine the laminar flame propagation [103,456]. Cyclopentadienyl and
benzyl  are  RSRs,  which  have  high  concentration  levels  in  cyclo-
pentadiene  and  toluene  flames.  Their  slow  decomposition  and  easy
combination with H-atom have a negative influence on the concentra-
tions of chain reaction carriers. For styrene flame, it is mainly consumed
by reacting with H- and O-atoms on both the moiety of vinyl and the
benzene ring [214]. No RSR is involved, thus it has a high laminar flame
speed.

Several  experimental  studies  were  also  performed  to  measure  the
extinction strain rates of aromatics [104,106,107,456]. Comparing the
experimental  measurements  and  model  predictions  in  Fig.  11,  cyclo-
pentadiene has higher extinction strain rates than toluene, and benzene
and styrene have the values in-between them. Generally, the extinction

strain rates of aromatics are sensitive to small species chemistry and to
the  oxidation  chemistry  of  the  primary  intermediates  from  the  fuel
decomposition, which are aromatic in nature and fuel-structure depen-
dent. The RSR reactions may be also crucial on the extinction strain rate
due  to  their  chain  termination  effect  [106,456],  besides  the
chain-branching  (H  + O2––O  + OH)  and  heat  release  (CO  +
OH––CO2+H) reactions. But detailed chemistry remains unrevealed on
the extinction strain rates of fundamental aromatic structures, because
of  the  lack  of  experimental  data  and  the  large  deviation  between
modeling and experimental results.

3. High-temperature aromatic chemistry

Chemical kinetics of alkylaromatics shapes the aromatic combustion
chemistry  in  petrochemical  industry  [463–466]  and  other  aromatic
hydrocarbon  related  chemical  engineering  fields  [10,20,467].  The
high-temperature  chemistry  of  alkylaromatics  contains  not  only  the
fundamental  kinetics  in  Section  2,  but  also  those  specific  features
introduced  by  the  lengthened,  branched,  cyclic,  and  multiple  sub-
stituents,  the  varied  aryl  group  position,  and  the  polycyclic  aromatic
rings.  Commonalities  and  characteristics  are  summarized  in  the
following paragraphs.

3.1. Single substituent

3.1.1. Benzylic mechanism for alkylbenzene combustion

Ethylbenzene,  n-propylbenzene,  n-butylbenzene,  etc.,  are  n-alkyl-
benzenes with only one alkyl substituent. In the view of alkyl substituted
aromatics, the high temperature reaction classes of n-alkylbenzenes are
similar to those of toluene, including the unimolecular decomposition

reactions,  the  H-abstraction  reactions,  and  the  ipso-substitution  re-
actions. In another view of aryl substituted alkane, these reactions of n-
alkylbenzenes are also similar to alkanes. Simmie [468] reviewed the
high  temperature  combustion  of  alkanes,  which  provided  very  good
references for these reactions. Benzene ring of alkylbenzene is relatively
inert compared to its alkyl substituent. Reactions occurred at the ben-
zene ring of alkylbenzene are similar to those of phenyl in Section 2.
Benzylic  mechanism  caused  by  phenyl  group  is  the  most  significant
commonalities  of  alkylbenzene  chemistry  and  the  crucial  difference
from normal alkanes.

As shown in Table 2, benzylic C–C bond has the lowest BDE among
all  the  C–C  bonds  in  ethylbenzene,  n-propylbenzene  and  n-butylben-
zene. The benzylic C–C bond dissociation reaction is, therefore, the most
favorite among unimolecular decomposition reactions of alkylbenzenes.
The reaction channel to benzyl + methyl (R141) is favorable for ethyl-
benzene  decomposition  in  both  entropy  and  enthalpy  [211,294,430].
The  so  called  “H  ring  walk”  channel  of  ethylbenzene  yielding
ethylidene-cyclodiene isomers due to the benzylic conjugation, howev-
er, has negligible branching ratio [430]. Similarly, over 70% of n-pro-
pylbenzene  and  n-butylbenzene  decompose  via  benzylic  C–C  bond
fission  under  the  pyrolytic  condition  at  30  Torr  [144,145,215].  In
contrast,  the  dissociation  reactions  of  C–H  bonds,  phenylic  C–C  bond
and alkylic C–C bond only have negligible contributions.

The H-abstraction reactions of ethylbenzene take place at primary,

correlated  them  with  the  reactions  of  hydrocarbons  at  allylic  site.
Ipso-substitution reactions of alkylbenzene occur besides H-abstraction
reactions.  H-atom,  O-atom,  and  OH  attacks  the  alkyl  neighboring
C-atom, then produces alkyl radical and benzene, phenoxy, and phenol
via subsequent β-scissions, respectively.

Long alkyl C-chain leads to easy isomerization of phenylalkyl radical.
Firstly,  intramolecular  H-transfer  is  typical  isomerization  reaction  of
phenylalkyl radical, e.g. 2-phenylethyl can isomerize to a more stable 1-
phenylethyl or a more reactive o-ethylphenyl. Secondly, phenyl migra-
tion via the substituent rearrangement with 3-, 4- and 5-member ring
intermediates [471], as shown in Fig. 12. The isomerization via 5-mem-
ber ring has the lowest energy barrier, but it has the deepest potential
well. Phenylalkenes or phenyl + alkenes are formed via β-scission, e.g.

ethylphenyl  (C6H4C2H5),  respectively.  Branching  ratios  analysis  illus-
trated the dominance of the benzylic site, either by the H-abstraction of
H-atom,  OH,  and  HO2  [294,336,469].  H-abstraction  reactions  of
n-propylbenzene and n-butylbenzene also mainly occur at the benzylic
position [68,340,470]. Zhou et al. [340] calculated the rate constants for
H-abstraction reactions of alkylbenzenes by 3O2 at the benzylic site, and

R142  –  R144  in  ethylbenzene  combustion  [140,414,472–474].  In
particular, the rate constants of R142 and R143 are commonly analo-
gized to those of 1,3-butadiene [472]. β-C-C scission is more preferable
than  β-C-H  scission  for  the  lengthened  phenylalkyl  radicals  yielding
styrene, benzyl, phenyl. The chemistry of alkylbenzene is thus converted
to those of “C6”, “C7”, and “C8” in their primary combustion process.

3.1.2. Lengthened substituent

n-propylbenzene

A number of experimental and modelling studies were performed for
n-alkylbenzene combustion in literature covering a wide range of tem-
perature,  pressure,  and  stoichiometric  ratio  (SMM1,  Table  S5).  The
major  portion  of  publications  is  for  ethylbenzene  [82,83,94,100,119,
140,149,150,216,442,475–484],
[86,87,94,101,
105–107,112,130,133,151,170,216,483,485–487], and n-butylbenzene
[88,93,118,120,143,170,216,221,222,487,488];  only  a  few  publica-
tions  focus  on  longer  n-alkylbenzene  [121,122,489–492].  All  these
measurements  provide  sufficient  modelling  targets,  including  the
speciation  data  of  pyrolysis,  oxidation,  and  flame  and  the  macro  pa-
rameters of ignition delay time, laminar burning velocity, and extinction
strain rate. Several kinetic models were developed for these aromatics
[86,88,111,120,130,144,151,152,215,216,224,493]  [492],  generally
revealing similar kinetic analysis.

Speciation measurements prove the benzylic mechanism in the py-
rolysis  [111,133,144,145,215,355,476],  oxidation  [112,118,119,122,
130,140,143,144,218,486,493] and flames [111,120,144,149–152,221,
481,482] of n-alkylbenzene. Typically, Sun et al. [215] reported similar
amount of toluene and styrene in the pyrolysis of ethylbenzene, n-pro-
pylbenzene, and n-butylbenzene; Herbinet et al. [122] reported almost
identical concentrations of toluene and styrene in the JSR oxidation of
ethylbenzene,  n-butylbenzene,  and  n-hexylbenzene  under  the  same
temperature  and  pressure  condition.  Again,  benzylic  mechanism  de-
termines the primary combustion intermediates of alkylbenzenes.

Oxidation  of  n-alkylbenzenes  is  impacted  by  the  lengthened  sub-
stituent.  As  shown by  the  simulation  results  in  Fig.  13,  the  oxidation
temperature of toluene is the highest whilst those of ethylbenzene, n-
propylbenzene, and n-butylbenzene decrease gradually. n-Butylbenzene
even has low-temperature oxidation reactivity at around 620 K. There-
fore, the reactivity of n-alkylbenzene has an obvious enhancement from
toluene to n-butylbenzene, along with the length of alkyl substituent.
Firstly, this is because H-abstraction reaction at the benzylic site pro-
vides less contribution with lengthened substituent, whilst those at other
alkyl sites gradually provide more contributions. Secondly, the subse-
quent  fate  of  benzyl  is  different  from  these  benzylic  radicals  derived
from different alkylbenzene. Benzyl is hard to react with O2 since it is a
resonance stabilized radical. In the oxidation of toluene, benzyl radical
is  mainly  consumed  by  the  reactions  with  O,  HO2  and  so  on.  On  the
contrary, benzylic radicals with longer alkyl substituents may quickly
release  H-atoms  and  normal  alkyl/phenylalkyl  radicals  via  β-scission
and isomerization. Thirdly, normal alkyl/phenylalkyl radicals are more
active than benzyl radical, thus the O2-addition reaction has significant

ylbenzene, n-propylbenzene (n-A1C3H7) and n-butylbenzene (n-A1C4H9) by the
kinetic model of this review.

contributions to their consumption.

Ignition of n-alkylbenzene is impacted by the lengthened substituent.
The ignition delay time of aromatic hydrocarbon with single substituent
is controlled by the H-abstraction reaction of the fuel under high tem-
perature conditions. As shown in Fig. 14, toluene has the longest ignition
delay,  while  ethylbenzene,  n-propylbenzene  and  n-butylbenzene  have
similar but shorter ignition delay times. Due to the higher BDE of the
C–H bond at benzyl site of toluene, the H-abstraction reaction rate of
toluene  is  significantly  slower  than  alkylbenzenes  with  longer  alkyl
chain [151,334]. In addition, the oxidation reactions of benzyl by O and
HO2 effectively reduce the ignition delay time of the alkylbenzenes [88].
Alkylbenzenes  with  longer  alkyl  chain  produce  benzyl  through  the
benzylic C–C  bond  cleavage  or the  β-scission  reaction  of phenylalkyl,
which is again much easier than toluene [144].

Flame propagation of n-alkylbenzene is impacted by the lengthened
substituent.  Fig.  15  compares  the  laminar  flame  speeds  of  benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, and n-butylbenzene  at atmo-
spheric  pressure  and  unburned  temperatures  of  398  and  423  K.  The

alkylbenzenes have similar laminar flame speeds. Ethylbenzene and n-
propylbenzene have similar values in the full equivalence ratio range of
0.5–1.3,  but  those  of  n-butylbenzene  slightly  peak  towards  the  lean
condition. Toluene has relatively smaller values in equivalence ratios of
0.8–1.2. From toluene to n-butylbenzene, the adiabatic flame tempera-
ture varies negligibly, the diffusion properties are also very similar, the
difference in the laminar flame speeds is therefore attributed to chemical
kinetics. Benzyl reactions play the controlling role [103]. H-radical is
the most effective flame speed enhancer because of its branching acti-
vation [494]. But the combination of benzyl and those reactive radicals
are sensitive termination reactions, particularly with H-radical, which in
turn  inhibit  the  laminar  flame  speeds  of  n-alkylbenzene  [102,103].
Toluene flame has the highest benzyl concentration comparing to other
n-alkylbenzenes, therefore has the slowest laminar flame speed. Under
the  very  lean  condition,  the  oxidative  atmosphere  promotes  the  con-
sumption  of  benzyl  through  the  oxidation  reactions  with  O  and  HO2
[102,103], the radical–radical reactions relatively reduce its contribu-
tion in benzyl consumption. Therefore, the flame speeds of toluene have
a good agreement with those of other alkylbenzenes on the very lean
side, as shown in Fig. 15b. This mechanism may also explain the faster
flame  speed  of  benzene  than  alkylbenzenes.  Phenyl  is  not  a  long-life
radical, it quickly participates the oxidation reaction with O2 releasing
phenoxy and O-atom, which in turn enhances the production of reactive

radicals.

Extinction strain rate of n-alkylbenzene is impacted by the length-
ened  substituent.  Fig.  16  shows  the  extinction  strain  rate  with  the
variation of temperature and the mole fraction of toluene, ethylbenzene,
n-propylbenzene,  and  n-butylbenzene
in  their  diffusive  flames
[105–107]. The extinction strain rates of toluene are entirely the lowest
and those of n-butylbenzene are the highest, the values of ethylbenzene
and n-propylbenzene stay in between. The extinction of diffusion flames
is indeed determined by the mass diffusion, combustion enthalpy, and
chemical kinetics of the alkylbenzenes. For mono-substituted alkylben-
zenes,  the  normalized  molar  mass  and  combustion  enthalpy  change
slightly with the varying length of alkyl substituents, which indicates the
impact  on  extinction  strain  rate  by  the  reactivity  of  alkylbenzene.
Benzylic chemistry plays as the chain-termination in the flame, which in
turn  inhibits  the  concentrations  of  OH,  HCO,  O,  and  so  on.  Such
mechanism strongly reduces the heat release rate in the flame reaction
zone.  H-abstraction  reactions  of  ethylbenzene,  n-propylbenzene,  and
n-butylbenzene  generates  other  phenylalkyl  radicals  besides  the
benzylic C–C bond fission, which reduces the production of benzyl with
the lengthened alkyl substituent. Small radical species generated from
the  alkyl  substituent  also  enhance  the  pool  of  active  radicals,  and
thereby promote the reactivity of the system. As discussed above, long
alkyl substituent promotes the oxidation reactivity of alkylbenzene at

high temperature. n-Butylbenzene and n-propylbenzene have relatively
shorter  characteristic  reaction  time,  thus  corresponds  to  relatively
higher  extinction  strain  rates  than  toluene.  So  far,  many  reactions  in
benzylic chemistry are estimated or analogized to those of alkanes or
alkenes,  the  model  predictability  is  therefore  not  satisfactory  on  the
extinction strain rate. Experimental and theoretical studies are required
to improve our knowledge on the key reactions of benzylic chemistry,
such as the reactions with O, OH, HO2 and its self-reactions.

3.1.3. Migrated phenyl position and branched substituent

x-Phenylalkane (x = 2, 3, etc.) is the alkylbenzene in which phenyl
group is connecting to the x-site of alkane, e.g., s-butylbenzene. It still
has  a  straight  alkane  chain  in  its  molecular  structure  which  is  very
similar  to  n-alkylbenzene.  Limited  combustion  chemistry  studies  of  i-
propylbenzene  [163,170,223–225,486]  and  s-butylbenzene  [163,219]
revealed similar reaction kinetics but resulted to difference products. On
one hand, benzylic position still provides the dominant C–C and C–H
bond fission in the pyrolysis and oxidation [219,223–225]. Phenylethyl
and phenylpropyl derived via C–C bond fission of i-propylbenzene and
s-butylbenzene  only  form  styrene  [219,224];  but  radicals  derived  via
benzylic  C–H  fission  of  x-phenylalkane  form  different  alkyl-styrene
[219,223].  On  the  other  hand,  x-phenylalkane  has  only  one  benzylic
H-atom, which in turn reduces the H-abstraction efficiency on benzylic
site [219,224]. In the current models of x-phenylalkane [219,223–225],
the reactions of x-phenylalkane and related fuel radicals were usually
taken  from  n-alkylbenzene  or  similar  alkanes,  because  Belisario-Lara
et al. [495] provided the only theoretical study on the rate coefficients
for the decomposition of s-butylbenzene. In general, the sub-mechanism
of x-phenylalkane quickly converts its combustion to “C8”-chemsitry.
The difference of n- and i-butylbenzene is the branched alkyl sub-
stituent, t-butylbenzene further combines the effect of migrated phenyl
position to i-butylbenzene. Very few studies investigated the pyrolysis,
diffusion  flame,  and  laminar  flame  speed  of  these  two  alkylbenzenes
[48,170,220,496].  Benzylic  mechanism  is  still  functionable  in  i-  and
t-butylbenzenes combustion [48]. For i-butylbenzene, negligible influ-
ence  is  observed  from the  branched  substituent. Benzyl  radical is  the
dominant  decomposition  product;  3-phenylpropene  is  the  product  of
benzylic  C–H  bond  fission,  which  is  a  methylstyrene.  Among  the
H-abstraction  reactions,  the  benzylic  H-atom  is  preferred  due  to  the
formation of RSR, A1CHCH(CH3)2; The terminal H-atom is also preferred
due to its large amount (6 H-atoms). For t-butylbenzene, the migrated
phenyl position to the center C-atom of branched butyl substituent re-
sults to methylstyrene via either C–C or C–H bond fission, because of the
absence  of  benzylic  C–H  bond.  And  methylstyrene  was  proposed  to
convert to styrene and indene in the model [48].

For the combustion reactivity, almost identical consumption profiles
were measured in the JSR oxidation of n- and i-propylbenzene [224],
and almost identical laminar flame speed values were measured for four

butylbenzene  isomers  [220].  These  phenomena  imply  that  branched
substituent and migrated phenyl position does not influence the basic
combustion characteristic of x-phenylalkane, it is still determined by the
properties  of  their  alkane  substituents.  In  summary,  phenyl  group  is
unreactive compared with the alkyl group in alkylbenzene, which is very
different from toluene, styrene and phenylacetylene. The main chem-
istry of alkylbenzenes does not have significant difference from alkanes,
except the conjugation effect at the benzylic site due to phenyl group.
The degree of branching does not have any influence on the combustion
alkylbenzene, because it does not change the molecular structure aside
the benzylic site. However, the migrated phenyl position does change
the  molecular  structure  aside  the  benzylic  site,  which  turns  the  com-
bustion chemistry of alkylbenzene from “C7” to “C8”.

3.2. Multiple substituents

3.2.1. Xylene and trimethylbenzene

The  decomposition  of  xylene  isomers  (o-,  m-,  and  p-CH3C6H4CH3)
proceeds via unimolecular bond fission reactions and yields dominantly
xylyl  radicals  (o-,  m-,  and  p-CH3C6H4CH2)  + H  and  minorly  methyl-
phenyl radicals + CH3  [497,498]. Initial reaction of xylene + O2  and
H-abstraction  reactions  also  produce  xylyl  and  dimethylphenyl.
Modeling work prefers the recent measurements [499,500] of the rate
constants of xylenes + OH reactions instead of the reviewed values in
Baulch et al. [270]. The rate constants of other H-abstraction reactions
at methyl-chain were estimated from toluene, multiplied by a factor 2 to
take into account the involved H-atoms in xylene molecules [84]. For
the  ipso-substitution  reactions  of  xylenes,  toluene  is  yielded  by  H,
dimethylphenoxy and methylphenoxy are yielded by O, and cresol and
dimethylphenol are yielded by OH [226,227]. 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-Trime-
thybenzene  have  similar  reaction  scheme  in  their  combustion,  and
yields  similar  products  but  with  one  more  methyl  group  [224].
“C7”-chemistry  (Section  2.3)  is  thus  the  base  of  xylene  and  trime-
thylbenzene combustion. Multiple methyl substituents do not have any
essential influence to the benzene ring but have interactions with each
other.

3.2.2. Xylyl, dimethylbenzyl, and dimethylphenyl reactions

Similar to benzyl, methylfulvenallenes (C7H5CH3) are yielded from
xylyl isomers (R145). But H-elimination from the other methyl group of
xylyl radicals also forms xylylenes (CH2C6H4CH2), as shown in Fig. 17.
Quantum  chemical investigations [501–503]  suggested  that a)  o- and
p-xylyls  primarily  decompose  to  o-  and  p-xylylene  with  an  activation
energy of 67.3 and 61.5 kcal/mol (R146), respectively; b) m-xylyl de-
ring-contraction
composes
/methylene-migration  mechanism.  Methyl  elimination  of  xylyl  iso-
mers, particularly m-xylyl, form fulvenallene (R147).

H. Jin et al.

Hemberger and his co-workers [146,410,411,504,505] studied the
isomerization of xylyl and the subsequent reaction kinetics of xylylene
by coupling iPEPICO spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculation, and
Franck(cid:0) Condon simulation. m-Xylyl rearranges to both o- and p-xylyls
(R148), and subsequently leads to o- and p-xylylene (R146). p-Xylylene
was identified as the dominant decomposition product of m-xylyl [504].
Such mechanism explains the slow decomposition rate of m-xylyl: the
overall entropy penalty for the tight transition state in the isomerization
is significantly higher that of the loose transition state in the C–H bond
dissociation,  although  the  energy  barrier  of  R148  (70  kcal/mol)  is
similar  to  that  of  R146.  The  dominance  of  p-xylylene  in  the  m-xylyl
decomposition  may  be  explained  by  the  rapid  isomerization  from
o-xylylene  to  benzocyclobutene  (C6H4cC2H4,  R149)  [410]  or  styrene
under combustion conditions, as shown in Fig. 17. The experiment of
Pachner et al. [411] confirmed that o-xylyl decomposition product was
rather  benzocyclobutene  than  o-xylylene.  Compared  to  o-xylylene,
p-xylylene  is  thermally  stable,  therefore,  it  was  preferred  by  m-  and
p-xylyl decomposition and the experimental measurements. In addition,
phenylacetylene and trace amount of benzocyclobutadiene were iden-
tified as further reaction products of o-xylylene [411].

reactions of xylyl and O/OH/HO2. In the published xylene models [84,
116,131,230], these reactions are analogized from the “C7”-chemistry in
Section 2.3.3: a) the reaction of xylyl with O-atom produces methyl-
benzaldehyde + H, toluene + HCO, and methylphenyl + CH2O; b) the
reaction of xylyl and OH produces cresol; c) the reaction of xylyl and
or

methylbenzyl-hydroperoxide, which again yields methylbenzoxyl + OH
via O–O bond fission; d) methylbenzoxyl decomposes majorly to meth-
ylbenzaldehyde and minorly to toluene + HCO/methylphenyl + CH2O
[38]; e) methylbenzaldehyde produces methylphenyl radicals + CO via
the intermediate of methylbenzoyl. Dimethylphenyl is another impor-
tant radical group besides xylyl. Dames and Wang [402] found that only
at o-alkyl site, e.g. 2,5-dimethylphenyl, can isomerize to corresponding
xylyl. Those isolated dimethylphenyls, different from o-dimethylphenyl,
react with O2  leading to the secondary chain branching reactions. The
reactions of dimethylphenyl with O2, O, and HO2 are nothing new from
those  of  methylphenyl  (Section  2.3.4).  In  the  combustion  of  trime-
thylbenzenes,  dimethylbenzyl  and  trimethylphenyl  radicals  follow
similar oxidation reactions  as xylyl and  dimethylphenyl, respectively,
produce similar products but with one more methyl group.

3.2.3. Methyl site effect in methylated benzenes

Table  S6  (SMM1)  summarizes  all  the  experimental  work  on  the

The reaction kinetics of trimethylbenzene is similar to that of xylene,
but it has three isomers, 1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Six
different dimethylbenzyl isomers in total may be derived from the three
trimethylbenzenes, which can be grouped to the o-, m-, and p-styles, as
shown in Fig. 18. The further decomposition of dimethylbenzyl isomers
is  determined  by  different  styles,  similar  to  xylyl  isomers.  o-Style
dimethylbenzyl  produces  o-dimethylene-methylbenzene  and  methyl-
benzocyclobutadiene;  p-style  dimethylbenzyl  produces  p-dimethylene-
methylbenzene;  m-style  dimethylbenzyl  produces  2,5-dimethylene-1-
methylbenzene.  Some  dimethylbenzyls  that  grouped  by  two  styles
may undergo the competing channels of different styles, e.g. 2,4-dime-
thylbenzyl.  Due  to  the  competitive  advantage  of  o-  and  p-styles  over
m-style, 2,5- and 3,4-dimethylbenzyl follow the reaction schemes of o-
and p-styles, respectively.

So  far,  no  experimental  or  theoretical  study  is  available  for  the

combustion  chemistry  of  xylene  and  trimethylbenzene.  Literature
experimental studies provide sufficient speciation data of oxidation [89,
115–117,123,131,132,141,142,506]  and flame  [146,147,154,167] for
model development, and abundant global combustion parameters [83,
84,89,90,93,94,100–102,105–107,507] for model validation, covering
a wide range of temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio. Several
kinetic  models  are  reported  for  the  combustion  of  xylene  and  trime-
thylbenzene [89,132,508,509]. Recently Tian and his co-workers [123,
124]  reviewed  the  previous  investigations  and  published  a  combined
kinetic model for both 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.

Critical intermediates were measured in the pyrolysis, oxidation, and
flames of xylene and trimethylbenzene isomers [89,115–117,123,124,
131,132,141,142,146,147,154,224,226,227,229,324,506,510], such as
methylethylbenzene,
dimethylphenanthrene,  methyl-
benzaldehyde, dimethylbenzaldehyde, vinyl-dimethylbenzene,  etc. All
these  intermediates  represent  the  consistency  of  xylene  and  trime-
thylbenzene isomers with toluene in combustion kinetics. As shown in

dixylyl,

Fig. 19, black, green, red, blue bonds indicate the methyl groups of the
xylene  and  trimethylbenzene  isomers.  Different  combinations  of  the
colored bonds can splice out o-, m-, p-xylene and 1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, and 1,3,
5-trimethylbenzene, e.g. black-green for o-xylene, black-red-blue for 1,
3,5-trimethylbenzene.  The  decomposition  of  one  specific  isomer  of
xylene  and  trimethylbenzene  can  be  followed  by  its  corresponding
combination of colored bonds. In general, “C7”-chemistry is applicable
to describe or predict the intermediates in the combustion of xylene and
trimethylbenzene. Stepwise methyl elimination and benzyl (xylyl and
dimethylbenzyl) decomposition and oxidation are the core reactions in
this process. In Fig. 19, methylphenyl and dimethylphenyl are widely
formed in the combustion of xylene and trimethylbenzene isomers. The
reactions  of  methylphenyl  become  crucial,  which  are  not  highly  con-
cerned in the combustion of toluene. The O2-addition to methylphenyl
may yield o- or p-benzoquinone, whilst removing the methyl group at
ortho-  or  para-site  [226,227].  Such  mechanism  is  also  applicable  for
dimethylphenyl yielding methylbenzoquinone. However, it was not re-
ported  in  the  speciation  measurements  of  previous  studies  of  trime-
thylbenzene  combustion  [89,123,124,132,224,229,230].  Benzofuran

(C8H6O) is an special oxygenated aromatic product in the combustion of
o-xylene [226], which is not commonly observed in the combustion of
toluene  [110,208].  The  oxidation  of  methylphenyl  again  plays  an
important  role  in  the  formation  of  benzofuran.  o-Hydroxybenzyl
(oCH2C6H4OH)  derived  from  the  oxidation  of  methylphenyl  yields
o-vinylphenol via methyl addition. The model of Yuan et al. [226] pro-
posed the ring-closure reaction of o-vinylphenoxy (OC6H4C2H3) radical
to  be an  important pathway,  however,  mismatched  the  mole  fraction
and the equivalence ratio tendency of benzofuran in their JSR experi-
ment. Further investigation on the benzofuran formation is required to
fully resolve the combustion chemistry of xylene and trimethylbenzene.

Different methyl sites (ortho-, meta-, and para-) impact the oxidation
of  xylene  and  trimethylbenzene  isomers.  o-Xylene  exhibits  higher
reactivity  than  other  isomers  under  intermediate-to-high  oxidation
temperatures. Emdee et al. [141,142] investigated the oxidation of three
xylene isomers in a flow reactor and they again found that o-xylene is
more  reactive  than  m-  and  p-xylene.  They  analyzed  that  the  simulta-
neous route involving o-xylylene and production of styrene may explain
the higher reactivity of o-xylene. In particular, the formation of o-xyly-
lene and its rearrangement to styrene is fast, styrene reacts more quickly
than the xylenes, and it reacts further to produce reactive phenyl and
vinyl radicals while p-xylylene and m-xylyl radical, formed during the
oxidation of p- and m-xylene, respectively, are less reactive. Dagaut and
co-workers  [115–117]  investigated  the  oxidation  of  three  xylene  iso-
mers  in  JSR  at  1  atm  over  temperature  ranges  of  900–1400  K  and
measured the ignition delay times of xylene isomers using shock tube
over temperature range of 1396–1826 K. They found that oxidation of
o-xylene is faster than that of m- and p-xylene, at atmospheric pressure,
the oxidation reactivity of m-xylene is quite similar to that of p-xylene
under their investigated conditions and m-xylene reacts slightly slower
than p-xylene. Fig. 20 illustrates the experimental and simulated mole
fraction profiles of three xylene isomers in the JSR oxidation, it can be
seen  that  o-xylene  has  the  highest  oxidation  reactivity,  especially  at
lower  temperatures.  Similarly,  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene  has  higher
oxidation  reactivity  than  1,3,5-trimethylbenzene,  as  illustrated  in
Fig. 20. However, large discreteness can be observed from the experi-
mental  data,  and  the  kinetic  model  barely  captures  the  reactivity  of
these methylated benzenes, overpredicts the reactivity of m-xylene, but
underpredicts the reactivity of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. More accurate
experimental data and rate constants of key reactions are required to
improve the model performance.

Different  methyl  sites  (ortho-,  meta-,  and  para-)  also  impact  the
ignition,  propagation,  and  extinction  of  xylene  and  trimethylbenzene
isomers. As shown in Fig. 21a, xylene isomers have similar ignition delay
times: o-xylene has the shortest and m-xylene is slightly shorter than p-
xylene [83,84,115].The higher reactivity of o-xylene is solely because of
the higher reactivity of o-xylyl oxidation. Han et al. [102] measured the
ignition  temperatures  of  three  xylene  isomers.  They  found  that  the
ignition temperatures of o-xylene are lower than those of m- and p-xy-
lenes, as shown in Fig. 21b. They suggested that this difference may be
attributed to the isomerization reactions of dimethylphenyl radicals to
xylyl radicals. The formation of dimethylphenyl radicals with isolated
radical  sites,  which  react  with  O2  for  further  chain  branching.  At

intermediate-to-high  temperatures,  the  dimethylphenyl  radicals  with
sites  adjacent  to  the  methyl  groups  have  lifetimes  as  short  as  several
microseconds  and  can  easily  isomerize  to  the  stable  xylyl  radicals
through  the  H-transfer.  In  contrast,  the  dimethylphenyl  radicals  with
sites  isolated  from  the  methyl  groups have  longer  lifetime,  thus  have
higher  possibility  to  react  with  oxygen  for  the  secondary  chain
branching. o-, m-, and p-xylene can form 2, 1, and 0 isolated dimethyl-
phenyls.  o-Xylene  thus  results  in  higher  reactivity  and  lower  ignition
temperatures.

Ji  et  al.  [107]  measured  the  laminar  flame  speeds  and  extinction
strain rates of xylene and trimethylbenzene isomers. Three xylene iso-
mers  exhibit  similar  laminar  flame  speeds,  but  o-xylene  propagates
slightly faster than m- and p-xylene by 1–2 cm/s under lean conditions.
1,2,4-  and  1,3,5-trimethylbenzene  have  much  slower  laminar  flame
speeds than xylenes, as shown in Fig. 22a. For the extinction strain rates,
o-xylene flames show the highest resistance to extinction, and p-xylene
flames  show  the  lowest  one,  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene  and  1,3,5-trime-
thylbenzene  have  similar  extinction  strain  rates  and  exhibit  weaker
resistance  to  extinction  than  xylenes,  as  shown  in  Fig.  22b.  The
decreasing  laminar  flame  speed  and  extinction  strain  rate  with  the
increasing methylation of xylene and trimethylbenzene are determined
by the radical–radical chain termination reaction of benzylic radicals.
The  different  H-transfer  energy  barriers  of  different  xylyl  radicals
explain the overall reactivity in o-, m-, and p-xylene flames [402]. Such
small  difference  strongly  impacts  extinction  strain  rate,  but  has
comparatively  weaker  effect  on  laminar  flame  speed.  All  these  com-
bustion experiments suggest that peroxy reactions are not able to control
the  different  oxidative  reactivity  of  xylene  and  trimethylbenzene  at
high-temperature.

Indane has two easy C–H bond dissociation reactions leading to 1-
and 2-indanyl radicals (R150), as well as H-abstraction reactions, which
forms indene via β-C-H scission (R151). For 1-indanyl, its β–C-C scission
forms  o-vinylbenzyl  (C2H3C6H4CH2,  R152).  For  2-indanyl,  its  ring-
opening  reaction  and  subsequent  H-shift  lead  to  cyclopentadienyl,
phenyl, and benzyl (R153), in which benzyl channel is the most favor-
able [50]. But these reaction channels are energetically and entropically
not  preferred  according  to  the  quantum  chemical  calculation,  which
were confirmed in the modeling of indane premixed flame [239].

converted to “C8”  chemistry (R154 –  R156). The oxidation of indanyl
mainly  yields  indene;  only  a  small  portion  is  converted  to  indanoxy
(C9H9O) or indanone (C9H8O), and may finally form styrene and ben-
zene (R157 and R158) [239].

Indene is a model molecular for bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It
has two less H-atoms than indane, and has a molecular structure similar
to  cyclopentadiene.  The  sp3  C–H  bond  is  the  weakest  among  all  the
bonds  in  indene  (Table  2),  1.2  kcal/mol  lower  than  its  weakest  C–C
bonds.  Meanwhile,  the  C–H  bond  fission  is  also  entropically  favored
than C–C  bond  fission.  Limited theoretical and  experimental data are
available for these reactions [53,511–513], literature models adopted
these  values  from  the  similar  reactions  of  cyclopentadiene  [231,233,
239,243,514].  The  decomposition  of  indene  has  been  introduced  in
detail in its pyrolysis study [50,515], which is very similar to the “C5”
chemistry (Section 2.1). As shown in Fig. 23, the formation of indenyl
dominants  the
indene  consumption.  H-elimination  (R159)  and
H-abstraction  (R160)  are  the  major  reaction  pathways.  The  rate  con-
stants of R159 and R160a were evaluated in the recent aromatic model
of  Jin  et  al.  [50],  those  of  R160b  were  measured  by  Jin  et  al.  [53].
Indene consumption profiles were well reproduced in its pyrolysis and
oxidation  [50,53].  Literature  studies  also  proposed  the  unimolecular
ring-opening isomerization from indene to o-ethynyltoluene at very low
pressure [511,512], but was found be to negligible under combustion
relevant conditions [50]. In another work, da Silva and Bozzelli [516]
proposed the reaction of fulvenallene and C2H2 for indene, which could
be its unimolecular decomposition pathway. For the decomposition of
indenyl,  Jin  et  al.  [50]  proposed  three  reaction  channels  (R161)  by
reviewing previous studies [231,517], which was later supported by the
theoretical investigation of Sundar et al. [513]. But all these reaction
channels are difficult due to the high energy barriers (>75 kcal/mol).

ratios of indene pyrolysis at 30 and 760 Torr.

Indenyl  combines  with  methyl  yielding  1-methylindene,  which
finally converts to naphthalene via H-loss and ring expansion [429,518,
519].  Such reaction  scheme  is  similar to  the  conversion from  “C5”  to
“C6” in Section 2.5. Matsugi and Miyoshi [518] theoretically suggested
the contribution of 1-methyleneindene to naphthalene formation from
3-methylindenyl. However, deuterium substituted experiments by Zhao
et  al.  [429]  revealed  that  the  ring  expansion  of  1-indenylmethyl  was
more preferable, one H-atom each from methyl and indenyl was released
in this reaction process. Dubnikova and Lifshitz [519] and Lifshitz et al.
[233] also proposed the naphthalene formation from the ring expansion
of  2-indenylmethyl,  they  suggested  that  the  ring  expansion  of  inden-
ylmethyl  isomers  from  an  sp3  carbon  connected  methylene  group  is
much  faster  than  an  sp2  carbon.  Acetylene  addition  to  indenyl  domi-
nantly  forms  benzotropyl  over  benzofulvenallene  + H  [520],  which
agrees with the conversion from “C5” to “C7” (Section 2.3.2).

Indenyl oxidation reactions are totally analogized from “C5” chem-
istry in models [204,230], due to the lack of reliable experimental data.
Mebel and co-workers [521,522] theoretically investigated the reactions
of indenyl with O2 and O-atom. Indenone + OH is the prevailing product
channel  of  indenyl  + O2  reaction  (branching  ratio  ~  61–80%),  (for-
mylmethyl)phenyl + CO and coumarin + H are minor channels [521].
Indenyl  + O-atom  reaction  is  highly  exothermic,  indanone + H-atom
reaction is slightly endothermic, but both of them prefer the production
of  vinylphenyl  or  phenylvinyl  radicals  + CO  [522].  The  reaction  of
indenyl  + HO2  remains  mystery.  The  reaction  of  indenyl  + OH  may
produce indenol as an addition product, but will finally be converted to
“C8” chemistry as well.

3.3.2. Naphthalene and methylnaphthalene

The decomposition of naphthalene yields 1- and 2-naphthyl isomers,
which later oxidize like phenyl radical. The theoretical investigation on
the reaction of naphthalene and OH/O2 further confirmed the similarity
between naphthalene and benzene [523,524]. Lefort and Tsang [326]
calculated the rate constants for the C–C and C–H bond fission reactions
of α-methylnaphthalene and suggested the comparable values to those
of toluene. Jin et al. [234,237], Bounaceur et al. [525], and Mati et al.
[113] analogized the kinetics of α-methylnaphthalene to that of toluene,
which generally reproduced its pyrolysis and oxidation. The most part of
naphthalene  and  methylnaphthalene  combustion  is  therefore  in  the
scope of “C6” and “C7” chemistry. In this section, we will only clarify the
specific features introduced by the asymmetry of the extra benzene ring.
1-Naphthylmethyl radical is also a RSR, but more stable than benzyl
[526].  It  decomposes  dominantly  to  benzofulvenallene,  negligibly  to
indene,  naphthyl,  or  naphthyne  [237].  1-Methylnaphthyl  besides
1-naphthylmethyl  has  higher  contribution  in  α-methylnaphthalene
decomposition processes than methylphenyl in toluene decomposition
[237]. This may be because: a) more H-atoms on the aromatic rings; b)
an  easier  1,8-H-migration  among  the  “zigzag”  periphery  than  the
ortho-site. Oguchi and Murakami [527] calculated the rate constants for

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107630

H. Jin et al.

the reactions of 1-naphthylmethyl with O2 at CBS-QB3 and G3B3 levels.
1-Naphthylmethyl is difficult to be oxidized by O2, since the backward
reaction  from 1-naphthylmethylperoxy  to 1-naphthylmethyl + O2  are
always more than three orders magnitude faster than those decompo-
sition and isomerization pathways of 1-naphthylmethylperoxy at com-
bustion  relevant  temperature  and  pressure  ranges.  Among  the
decomposition  pathways  of  1-naphthylmethylperoxy,  1-naphthoxyl  +
CH2O was the main channel at the temperatures below 600 K, while,
1-naphthaldehyde + OH becomes the dominant channel at temperatures
above  600  K.  Their  calculations  supported  the  application  of  “C7”
chemistry  for 1-naphthylmethyl oxidation. According  to the model of
Mati  et  al.  [113],  the  reactions  of  1-naphthylmethyl  and  O/OH/HO2
follow  the  “C7”  chemistry  producing  1-naphthaldehyde,  1-naph-
thylmethanol, and 1-naphthylmethoxyl + OH at high temperature.

Similar to benzene, naphthalene reacts with O-atom and OH forming
naphthoxy  and  naphthol,  which  further  convert  to  indenyl  and  CO.
Different from phenyl, the C–H bond fission and H-abstraction reactions
of  naphthalene  produce  1-naphthyl  and  2-naphthyl  isomers,  respec-
tively. The pyrolysis study of naphthalene by Laskin et al. [528] sug-
gested  the  ring-opening  reactions  instead  of  β-C-H  bond  fission  for
naphthyne. The predominant ring-opening reactions of 1-naphthyl and
2-naphthyl were proposed to form C2H2C6H4C2H and C6H4C4H3, which
finally decompose to acetylene + phenylacetylene and phenyl + diac-
etylene, respectively. The addition of C2H2 or C2H4 to naphthyl radicals
follows  the  mutual  conversion  from  “C6”  to  “C8”  (Section  2.4.1),  but
1-naphthyl may differently form acenaphthylene [529–531]. Similar to
phenyl, the reactions of naphthyl and O2/HO2/O produce naphthoxy,
which subsequently eliminates a CO to yield indenyl.

3.3.3. Tetralin and dihydronaphthalene

Due to the similar molecular structures between tetralin and cyclo-
hexane, they may have similar combustion characteristics. But the ki-
netics of tetralin may be impacted by the benzene ring. Several literature
studies have modelled the kinetics of tetralin in pyrolysis and oxidation
[92,98,240–242,532–536].  Fig.  24  presents  the  decomposition  path-
ways of tetralin according to the evaluations and quantum calculations
[241,536]. The initiation of tetralin decomposition may undergo C–H or
C–C  bond  dissociation  reactions.  C–H  bond  fission  (R162)  produces
1-tetralyl  (1-H3A2)  and  2-tetralyl  (2-H3A2),  whilst  C–C  bond  fission
produces  three  biradicals,  1-butyl-2-phenyl,  1-propyl-2-benzyl,  and
1-ethyl-2-phenylethyl.  Recalling  the  benzylic  mechanism,  the  α–C-H

bond  impacted  by  the  benzene  ring  is  much  weaker  than  the  β–C-H
bond, which makes 1-tetralyl preferred among C–H bond fission. Simi-
larly,  the  β–C-C  bond  is  much  weaker  than  other  C–C  bonds,  which
makes  benzo-2-hexen-1,6-diyl  biradical  (CH2A1C3H6)  the  preferred
biradical.  Further  decomposition  products  of  CH2A1C3H6,  like  o-xyly-
lene,  benzocyclobutane,  and  o-allyltoluene  are  stable  that  almost  no
chain reactions can be initiated, it thus can hardly compete with R162 in
radical pool formulation. The C–C bond decomposition scheme there-
fore may be simplified to R163 and R164. For H-abstraction reaction,
1-tetralyl is dominant over 2-tetralyl again due to benzylic mechanism.
Finally,  H-atom  ipso-substitution  reaction  produces  4-phenylbutyl
radical.

β–C-H scission of 1-/2-tetralyl forms 1,2- and 1,4-dihydronaphtha-
lene  (R165,  1,2-/1,4-H2A2).  Step-wise  dehydrogenation  reaction  of
dihydronaphthalene  isomers  forms  naphthalene  (R166),  which  is  the
major pyrolysis products of tetralin [241]. β–C-C scission of 1-/2-tetralyl
forms C2H3A1CH2CH2  and o-allylbenzyl (CH2A1C3H5), respectively. As
illustrated in Fig. 24, C2H3A1CH2CH2  yields divinylbenzne (a “C8”  in-
termediate) via β–C-H scission and 1-indanylmethyl via ring shrinking.
The ring-contraction reaction of 2-tetralyl radical also produces 1-inda-
nylmethyl  [537],  while  the  ring-contraction  reaction  of  o-allylbenzyl
produces indene.

(oCH2A1CHO,

The  low–temperature  reactions  are  not  very  effective  in  tetralin
oxidation [242,535]. Oxidation reaction of 1-tetralyl forms 1-tetrahy-
dronaphthalenoxy radical (1-H3A2O, R167), which later yields o-meth-
ylenebenzaldehyde
3,
4-dihydronaphthalen-1-one.  For  2-tetralyl,  Li  et  al.  [240]  suggested
that  its  H-shift,  ring-opening,  and  H-elimination  reactions  were  more
favorable  than  oxidation  reactions.  O2  addition  to  1-/2-tetralyl  is
important to produce HO2, which explains not only the large yield of
dihydronaphthalene  (R169)  but  also  the  formation  of  benzofuran
(cC8H6O, R170 and R171) [242]. 1-/2-Tetralylperoxy radicals in turn
favors  the  tetralin  oxidation  through  its  successive  isomerization,
decomposition, and rearrangement.

derived from the unimolecular decomposition of naphthylmethyl. In the
oxidation studies of α-methylnaphthalene, Shaddix et al. [541] and Mati
et al. [113] recommended the oxidation of naphthylmethyl via the re-
action  pathways  of  naphthaldehyde  and  naphthoxy  radical.  Ignition
delay times of α-methylnaphthalene were measured in shock tube [91,
542]  and  RCM  [96,97]  over  various  conditions  (pressure:  8–45  atm;
temperature: 840–1445 K; equivalence ratio: 0.5–1.5). Fig. 25 compares
the  data  of  toluene  and  α-methylnaphthalene  at  similar  combustion
conditions, and reveals their similar ignition reactivity. All these phe-
nomena  confirm  the  high  similarity  between  methylnaphthalene  and
toluene in the combustion kinetics.

Several  studies  measured  the  ignition  delay  time  [92,98,534]  and
reported the intermediates in the combustion of tetralin [240,241,535,
545,546].  The  benzene  ring  in  the  molecular  structure  introduces
asymmetric  effect and  benzylic  effect  to tetralin,  comparing  to  cyclo-
hexane [241]. Benzene ring makes tetralin asymmetric, thus yields 1-
and 2-tetralyl radicals [240,242,337]. The following decomposition of
1-  and  2-tetralyl  isomers  yields  different  characteristic  products,  like
styrene and indene [337]. Particularly, the oxidation of 2-tetralyl may
yield benzofuran, which is recommended by Dagaut et al. [242]. Sty-
rene, indene and benzofuran were found to be in high concentrations
besides naphthalene and dihydronaphthalene in the combustion of tet-
ralin [240,242,337]. Benzene also introduces benzylic effect to tetralin.
Benzylic C–H bond is favored by direct dissociation and H-abstraction
reactions  [240,242,337].  The stability  of the  benzylic radical  reduces
the overall reactivity of the tetralin [242]. o-Xylylene is proposed to be
formed via the benzylic C–C bond dissociation, which was quantitatively
measured  in  Li  et  al.  [240,337].  But  this  reaction  is  relatively  minor
comparing to the decomposition reaction of benzylic C–H bond. Fig. 25
compares the ignition delay times of tetralin [92], toluene [80], decalin
[543], n-propylbenzene [92], and cyclohexane [544]. The ignition delay
time of tetralin is higher than those of decalin and cyclohexane, because
benzylic effect introduces higher stability of the main tetralin radical,
1-tetralyl. But generally, tetralin behaves like a cycloalkane rather than
an aromatic due to its long cyclic substituent.

In summary, aromatic hydrocarbons can be recognized as ordinary
hydrocarbons, e.g. alkanes, alkenes, and naphthenes, that substituted by
phenyl or benzo group in their molecules. The combustion chemistry of
aromatic hydrocarbons is significantly influenced by the benzylic effect
from that of the ordinary hydrocarbons, due to the existence of benzene
rings. But the increasing number of benzene rings has weak promotion
on this effect. Aromatic hydrocarbons with multiple benzene rings do
not show obvious reactivity in their π-bond electrons but their periph-
ery.  The  increasing  benzene  rings  in  the  aromatics  generally  do  not

3.3.4. Benzene rings

Limited experimental studies have been performed on the combus-
tion  chemistry  of  indane  [238,239,538],  indene  [50,53,231,232,515,
539]  and  methylindene  [233].  Speciation  data  were  reported  for  the
oxidation  of  indane in  JSR  [538]  and  premixed  flame  [238,239]  and
mainly for the pyrolysis of indene and 2-methylindene in flow reactor
[50,515,539]  and  shock  tube  [231,233].  Besides,  Jin  et  al.  [53]  pro-
vided the indene consumption profile in a JSR and Zheng et al. [232]
provided the ignition delay times of indene. The impact of benzene ring
on the “C5”-chemistry may be revealed by comparing the combustion of
cyclopentadiene and indene.

Commonly,  the  combustion  of  indene  is  very  similar  to  that  of
cyclopentadiene. In the indene oxidation model of Zheng et al. [232],
the decomposition of indenoxy and indenone was proposed to be the
same as cyclopentadienoxy and cyclopentadienone, respectively. How-
ever, the benzene ring introduces more intermediates or decomposition
pathways  of  indene  and  indenyl  comparing  to  cyclopentadiene  and
cyclopentadienyl.  Jin  et  al.  [50,515]  measured  fulvenallene,  fulve-
nallenyl,  benzyne,  cyclopentadienyl  and  butadiyne  in  their  pyrolysis
experiments, which are typically derived from the benzene ring open of
indenyl. The most significant impact of benzene on “C5”-chemistry is the
reduction  of  rate  coefficient  of  bimolecular  reactions.  Jin  et  al.  [53]
found the reaction rate coefficients of hydroxy and indene is only half of
those between hydroxy and cyclopentadiene. They explained that the
higher rate coefficients of cyclopentadiene + OH than indene + OH were
possibly due to the difference of entropic changes in the two reactions,
which  is  reflected  in  the  pre-exponential  factor  of  the  Arrhenius
expression.

Previous  studies  [407,528]  investigated  the  combustion  of  naph-
thalene  in shock  tube  and premixed  flame. They found  that benzene,
phenylacetylene and indene are the major intermediates. The kinetics of
1- and 2-naphthyl radicals are hardly influenced by the extra benzene
ring, following the “C6”-chemistry. For the combustion of methylnaph-
thalene,  previous  studies  [113,540,541]  suggested  naphthalene  to  be
the most important intermediate. But recent experimental and modeling
studies by Jin et al. [234,237] observed larger amount of benzofulve-
nallene and benzofulvenallenyl comparing to naphthalene, which were

change the characteristic reaction kinetics, but introducing high steric
hindrance that slightly inhibit the reactivity of corresponding structures
of “C5” – “C8”.

4. Low-temperature aromatic chemistry

4.1. Low–temperature reaction classes of alkylbenzene

The low temperature reactivity of alkylbenzene increases with the
length  of  substituent.  General  low–temperature  reaction  classes  of
alkylbenzene are summarized below.

i.  O2-addition to fuel radical (R + O2 = ROO, phenylalkyl peroxy)
[144].  H-abstraction  reaction  of  n-alkylbenzene  by  O2  is  the
chain-initiation reaction producing phenylalkyl. Phenylalkyl has
O2-addition  toward  ROO,  which  initiates  the  low  temperature
chain-branching reactions.

ii. “Formally direct”  reaction of phenylalkyl. The reaction of phe-
nylalkyl  and  O2  yields  phenylalkene  + HO2  or  QOOH
(hydroperoxyalkyl).

iii.  Phenylalkyl and peroxy radicals reactions: R + ROO = RO + RO;

R + HO2 = RO + OH; R + CH3O2 = RO + CH3O.

iv.  Concerted  HO2-elimination  of  phenylalkyl  peroxy  produces
phenylalkene isomers. It occurs through a 5-membered transition
state, with subsequent O–O bond release taking an H-atom from
its neighboring C-atom.

v.  Isomerization  from  phenylalkyl  peroxy  to  hydroperoxyalkyl
(QOOH). This reaction is competitive to ROO decomposition, and
contributes to the chain-branching in low temperature oxidation.
Such isomerization occurs via an intramolecular H-transfer over
5-, 6-, or 7-member ring transition states. Reactions over 6- or 7-
member ring play significant roles, which reduce or enhance the
systematic reactivity.

vi.  ROO  bimolecular  reactions  for  ROOH.  Reactions  of  ROO  with
HO2,  H2O2,  CH3O2,  etc.  produce  phenylalkyl  hydroperoxides,
which compete with its isomerization reaction.

vii.  ROOH decomposes to RO + OH.
viii. RO  decomposes  to  either  phenylalkyl  + aldehyde  or  phenyl-

aldehyde/phenylketone + H.

ix.  Second  O2-addition  from  QOOH  to  OOQOOH.  It  is  the  third
chain-branching  step  in  the  low  temperature  oxidation  of
alkylbenzene.

x.  QOOH decomposition reactions. QOOH decomposes  to phenyl-
substituted  cyclic  ethers  and  OH.  This  reaction  competes  with
the  second  O2-addiiton  step,  thus  is  also  important  in  the  low
temperature oxidation of alkylbenzene. QOOH also decomposes
to aldehydes and ketones.

xi.  Phenyl-substituted  cyclic  ether  decomposes  via  H-abstraction

reactions and following β–scission.

xii. OOQOOH proceeds to ketohydroperoxide + OH. OOQOOH un-
dergoes  intramolecular  H-transfer  for  HOOQ-HOOH,  which  re-
leases an OH via β–scission for ketohydroperoxide.

xiii.  Ketohydroperoxides  decomposes  to  OH  and  another  stable
oxygenated species. This is the fourth chain-branching step in the
low temperature oxidation of alkylbenzene.

4.2. Low-temperature oxidation of alkylbenzene

4.2.1. Single substituent

In the low-temperature oxidation of alkylbenzene, the reaction ki-
netics  are  mainly  the  interaction  between  the  benzene  ring  and  the
substituent.  Benzylic  mechanism  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  high-
temperature  oxidation  of  alkylbenzene,  as  in  traduced  in  Section
3.1.2. Similarly, it also influences the oxidation reactivity of alkylben-
zene  at  low-temperature,  because  of  its  special  thermodynamic  prop-
erty. Taking the oxidation of ethylbenzene as an example, the reaction of
phenylethyl radicals and  O2  is  illustrated in Fig. 26, according to the
theoretical investigation of Murakami et al. [547] and Altarawneh et al.
[548]. For the A1CHCH3 + O2 reaction, all of the transition states for the
isomerization  reactions  of  1-phenylethylperoxy  radical  (A1CH(OO
)
CH3)  were  positioned  above  the  total  energy  of  the  reactants  of
A1CHCH3 + O2; for the A1CH2CH2 + O2 reaction, most of the transition
states  were  positioned  below  the  total  energy  of  the  reactants  of
2-phenylethyl  + O2.  In  the  temperature  range  of  300–1500  K,  the
backward  channel  forming  A1CHCH3  + O2  dominants  this  reaction,
whereas the forward channel forming cyclic O–O structure dominants
the  A1CH2CH2  + O2  reaction.  Kinetic  modeling  study  of  Yuan  et  al.
[111]  revealed  that  the  isomerization  reactions  of  phenylethylperoxy
radicals only contribute less than 1% in the oxidation of ethylbenzene
under 10 atm, due to the short substituent of ethylbenzene and strong
C–H bonds on the aromatic ring. Very similar situation was observed in
the oxidation of n-propylbenzene [86,144,218]. In the low temperature
oxidation of alkanes, the isomerization reaction from alkylperoxy (ROO)
to hydroperoxyalkyl (QOOH) is the critical chain branching step. Eth-
ylbenzene  and  n-propylbenzene  thus  present  very  low  reactivity  in
low-temperature oxidation.

•

Starting  from  n-butylbenzene,  alkylbenzene  (number  of  C-atom  in
substituent ≥4) shows considerable low-temperature reactivity. Exper-
imental and modeling results of n-butylbenzene oxidation at 500–1200
K, 10 atm and φ = 0.25 indicate the maximal low temperature reactivity
is achieved at ~640 K [118,152]. Its reaction network is similar to that
of  n-butane.  Phenylbutyl  isomers  derived  from  n-butylbenzene  are
oxidized by O2 yielding phenylbutylperoxy. Taking the major isomer as
an example, around 50% of 1-phenyl-1-butylperoxy later isomerizes to
QOOH  species,  and  the  rest  decompose  to  1-phenyl-1-butene  via
concerted  elimination  reaction.  Over  the  entire  negative  temperature
coefficient region, the contribution of concerted elimination increases
with temperature, the relative contribution to QOOH decreases, which
leads to chain branching via second O2-addition.

As  shown  in  Fig.  27,  the  low-temperature  oxidation  reactivity  of
alkylbenzene  increases  significantly  along  the  lengthened  alkyl  sub-
stituents. This is generally determined by the length of alkyl substituent,
irrelevant to the benzene ring. The lengthened alkyl substituent corre-
sponds to the reduced probability of H-abstraction reaction at benzylic
position. Since benzylic radical is a resonance stabilized radical, other
alkylic radicals are easier to be oxidized by O2. Longer alkyl substituent
also  enables  the  intramolecular  H-shift  from  ROO  to  QOOH  which  is
inhibited by the steric hindrance. Peroxy radicals produced from the O2-
addition to phenylalkyls proceed intramolecular H-transfer, thus initiate
the  chain-branching  reactions  at  low-temperature.  With  the  growing
length  of  alkyl  substituents,  the  portion  of  alkylic  radicals  increases.

the closer the oxidation kinetics of alkylbenzenes is to that of alkanes.

4.2.2. Multiple substituents

The sites of methyl groups in xylene and trimethylbenzene strongly
impact  their  low-temperature  chemistry  [38].  As  shown  in  Fig.  28,
o-xylylperoxy  easily  undergoes  the  intramolecular  H-transfer  from
benzylperoxy to its ortho-methyl group yielding o-(hydroperoxy)meth-
ylbenzyl (QOOH, R172). The QOOH then has a second O2-addition and
OH production via subsequent chain-branching reaction. Although xylyl
and O2 reaction was previously proposed to form xylylene + HO2 [141,
142,549] and methylbenzaldehyde + OH [115–117], quantum chemical

calculations by Canneaux et al. [550] suggested the dominance of R172
over 600–2000 K. Murakami et al. [551] further pointed out that the
intramolecular H-transfer from meta- and para-methyl groups of a ben-
zylperoxy  was  highly  unfavored  due  to  steric  hindrance.  oCH2C6H4-
CH2OOH decomposes to phthalane and OH at 300–1500 K [38]. da Silva
and Bozzelli [38] investigated the secondary O2-addition to oCH2C6H4-
CH2OOH  (QOOH)  at  low  temperature,  producing  oCH2OOC6H4-
CH2OOH. Another intramolecular H-transfer of oCH2OOC6H4CH2OOH
forms a double hydroperoxide alkyl, oCH2OOHC6H4C(•)HOOH, which
releases o-formylbenzoxy and two OH radicals in following decompo-
sition. o-Formylbenzoxy further dissociates to 1,2-diformylbenzene + H.
Therefore,  the  overall  process  is  typically  chain  branching,  which
explained  the  higher  oxidation  reactivity  and  lower  RON  of  o-xylene
than that of m- and p-xylene.

In addition, the bimolecular reactions o-/m-/p-xylyl and O2 yield o-/
m-/p-methylbenzaldehyde and OH. By analogy to benzyl, we may as-
sume that the m-xylyl + O2  mainly leads to o-methylphenoxy + CH2O
and the p-xylyl + O2  mainly leads to p-methylphenoxy + CH2O at low
temperature  [84].  For  o-methylbenzoxy  derived  in  the  oxidation  of
o-xylene,  its  intramolecular  H-transfer  from  the  ortho-methyl  group
yields o-hydromethylbenzyl (oCH2C6H4CH2OH), which has a very low
energy barrier of 9.9 kcal/mol [38]. At low temperature, O2 addition to
o-hydromethylbenzyl  forms  oCH2OOC6H4CH2OH,  which  proceeds  to
oCH2OOHC6H4CHOH  via  another  H-transfer.  oCH2OOHC6H4CHOH
radical decomposes to o-formylbenzylhydroperoxide + H at high tem-
perature,  but  undergoes  a  second  O2  addition  at  low  temperature,
leading  to  o-formylbenzoic  acid  via  similar  H-transfer,  C–O  and  O–O
bond fission reactions.

2,4- and 2,5-dimethylbenzyl radicals derived from 1,2,4-trimethyl-
benzene  have  ortho-methyl  groups.  As  illustrated  in  the  low-
temperature  chemistry  of  o-xylyl,  2,4-  and  2,5-trimethylbenzyl  can
also  proceed  similar  reaction  sequence:  two  stage  O2-addition,  intra-
molecular H-transfer, and subsequent chain-branching OH release. 3,4-
Dimethylbenzyl  from  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene  and  3,5-dimethylbenzyl
from  1,3,5-trimethylbenzene  are  difficult  to  achieve  the  intra-
molecular  H-transfer  of  their  ROO,  similar  as  m-  and  p-xylene  [38].
Previous studies [93,94,230] compared the auto-ignition properties of
xylene and trimethylbenzene. As shown in Fig. 29, the ignition delay
time of o-xylene is much shorter than m- and p-xylene at all pressures.
The reactivity of trimethylbenzenes is in the order of 1,2,3-trimethyl-
benzene  >1,2,4-trimethylbenzene  >1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.  Right
now,  we  know  intramolecular  H-transfer  between  the  methylperoxy
group and its ortho-methyl group is the critical step of low-temperature
oxidation  of  xylene  and  trimethylbenzene.  o-Xylene  has  higher  reac-
tivity  than  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene,  because  only  2/3  of  the  dime-
thylbenzyl radical from 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene has ortho-methyl group.
1,2,3-Trimethylbenzene  has  slightly  higher  reactivity  than  o-xylene,
because it has more H-atoms on methyl groups than o-xylene and all its
benzylic radicals have ortho-methyl group. We may further extend the
findings  in  methyl  benzene  derivates  to  alkylbenzene  with  multiple
substituents:  the  intramolecular  H-transfer  between  the  alkylperoxy
group and its ortho-alkyl group is the critical step of low-temperature
oxidation of alkylbenzene with multiple substituents. The position and

which begins from a “C6” radical and ends with newly formed aromatic
ring. RSR pathways are still able to be separated into two sub-classes,
RSR combination reactions and RSR chain reactions. RSR combination
reactions have long been considered as efficient pathways for PAH for-
mation besides benzene-based pathways, e.g. the recombination of two
cyclopentadienyl  radicals  [184].  But  recent  investigations  validated
several  RSR  chain  reactions  [50,234,351,379],  in  particular  the  clus-
tering of hydrocarbons by radical–chain reactions (CHRCR) [370]. RSR
chain reactions are thus considered as another general class of aromatic
growth  pathways,  that  are  independent  from  previous  PAH  reaction
network.  In  this  section,  we  will  briefly  introduce  those  frequently
reviewed pathways, but pay more attention on the recent advances.

5.1. Benzene-based pathways

5.1.1. H-abstraction unsaturated intermediates-addition

HACA  is  a  classical  benzene-based  pathway,  with  two  acetylene
addition on phenyl fusing naphthalene. Plenty investigations were per-
formed experimentally and/or theoretically on the reaction kinetics of
HACA [26,276,299,413,414,443,553–562]. Generally, HACA has three
reaction routes shown in Fig. 30: a) Bittner-Howard [443], b) Frenklach
[299,555–557,559,560],  c)  Modified  Frenklach  [299,555–557,559,
560].  Their  first  acetylene  addition  steps  are  almost the  same,  which
form a “C8” intermediate either C8H7  radical or phenylacetylene. Bitt-
ner–Howard route has its second acetylene addition to phenylvinyl, and
the  modified  Frenklach  route  undergoes  a  H-migration  from  vinyl  to
benzene ring followed by a second acetylene addition to vinylphenyl.
Both of them have the cyclization processes to C10H9 intermediate and
then yield naphthalene via H-elimination. The original Frenklach route
is  different,  it  has  the  second  acetylene  addition  to  ethynylphenyl
yielding  naphthyl.  Recently,  Mebel  et  al.  [69]  carried  out  detailed
theoretical  calculation  on  all  three  HACA  routes.  At  atmospheric  and
lower pressures, the C8H7 radicals, vinylphenyl and phenylvinyl, cannot
be stabilized above 1650 K, both Bittner–Howard and Modified Fren-
klach routes are thus unrealistic under these combustion conditions. The
original  Frenklach  route  is  shown  to  preferentially  form  naphthyl  or
naphthynes at T < 2000 K, and to produce mostly diethynylbenzene at
higher temperatures. The remaining controversy is that: a) Parker et al.

summarizing  the  reaction  pathways  from  small  combustion  in-
termediates to PAHs and soot. In this review, we are trying to elucidate
the  PAH  formation  in  a  unique  understanding.  In  this  review,  mass
growth process, that generally discussed in literature as PAH formation
pathways, is strictly separated into two category: a) mutual conversion
(Section  2.5)  and  b)  aromatic  growth.  Aromatic  growth  is  strictly
defined as the reaction that fuses new aromatic rings on the reactants.
Taking  H-abstraction  C2H2-addition  (HACA)  [69,300,552]  as  an
example, we recognize its second step as an aromatic growth pathway,
but its first step as a mutual conversion from C6 to C8. Separating by the
originated  molecular  structures,  aromatic  growth  pathways  can  be
further grouped into benzene-based and RSR pathways. Benzene-based
pathways  have  long  been  leading  the  investigations  of  aromatic
growth [184]. HACA mechanism is a typical benzene-based pathway,

[561] did not detect ethynylphenyl radical in their elementary experi-
ments of phenyl and acetylene; b) Yang et al. [562] did corroborate the
formation  of naphthalene from vinylphenyl and  phenylvinyl with the
reactions of acetylene. Similar to HACA, Shukla and Koshi [563] pro-
posed the vinyl addition to phenylacetylene for naphthalene formation.
The  reaction  of  vinylacetylene  and  phenyl  is  also  proposed  for
naphthalene formation (R173) [443,559], namely hydrogen-abstraction
vinylacetylene-addition  mechanism  (HAVA).  Although  Moriarty  and
Frenklach  [564]  suggested  that  the  phenyl  addition  to  the  double  or
triple  bond  of  vinylacetylene  were  equally  ineffective,  later  studies
[565–567] validated the formation of naphthalene from the reaction of
phenyl + vinylacetylene by quantum chemical calculation and crossed
molecular beam experiment. The phenyl addition to the end C-atom of
the double bond of vinylacetylene is found to be barrier-less, lower than
HACA [565,567]. HAVA was also applicable for m- and p-methylphenyl
yielding  α-  or  β-methylnaphthalene,  with  methyl  group  being  a  spec-
tator in this process [568,569]. Similar reaction of phenyl and 1,3-buta-
diene may have minor contribution to the aromatic growth due to its
formation of 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene, 1-methylindene, and 1,4-dihydro-
naphthalene [570–574].

multiple  reaction  process  is  inefficient.  The  H-assisted  isomerization
from  9-methylene-fluorene  [579]  and  2-ethynylbiphenyl  [580]  may
explain phenanthrene formation.

phenyl-pyrene and pyrene as the key reaction products in 1-naphthyl/-
phenylacetylene and 4-phenanthryl/phenylacetylene reaction systems.
Since phenylacetylene addition to aryl radical of “zigzag” and “armchair”
is  barrierless,  HAPaA  mechanism  is  thus  efficient  under  a  wide  com-
bustion  temperature  range.  As  shown  in  Fig.  32,  HAPaA  fuses  new
penta-  and  hexa-aromatic  rings,  creating  “zigzag”,  “armchair”,  “cove”,
and  “fjord”.  The  evolution  of  different  periphery  types,  including
“armchair” derived from the ring closure reactions of “cove” and “fjord”,
makes HAPaA a self-consistent mechanism. Direct dimerization of two
peri-condensed aromatic hydrocarbons (PCAHs) is kinetically unstable,
especially  at  the  high  temperatures  of  soot  nucleation  [582].  HAPaA
mechanism  can  be  generalized  to  other  α-alkynyl  PCAHs,  and  thus
provides an alternative covalent bond bridge for PCAH combination via
an acetylene linker. In the first step, the high concentration of acetylene
benefits its addition to PCAHs. In the second step, α-alkynyl PCAHs react
with aryl radicals at various periphery types, which in turn yields larger
PCAHs  via  the  HAPaA  mechanism.  The  continuous  loop  of  these  two
steps may cluster PCAHs to incipient soot particles.

The reaction of phenylacetylene + phenyl was usually proposed as
an important route for phenanthrene in literature PAH models [114,184,
575].  But  relative  theoretical  and  experimental  investigations  have
argued on three potential products for this reaction, shown in Fig. 31:
phenanthrene [566], 2-ethynyl-biphenyl [576], and diphenylacetylene
(A1C2A1) [577–579]. Several studies suggested the phenyl addition to
the  β-C-site  of  phenylacetylene  for  1,2-diphenylvinyl  radical  [566,
577–579]. Jin and co-workers [577,579] found diphenylacetylene to be
the  dominant  products  of  phenylacetylene  + phenyl  reaction.  This
conclusion was also supported by the phenylacetylene pyrolysis exper-
iments  [49].  Aguilera-Iparraguirre  et  al.  [566]  theoretically  proposed
the  isomerization  from  1,2-diphenylvinyl  to  phenanthrene,  but  this

5.1.2. Phenyl and benzyne addition

Phenyl combination reaction is a prototype for all the aryl radicals
(R174 and R175). Experimental measurements of the rate coefficients of
phenyl  combination  reaction  were  performed  in  several  literature
studies at around 1 atm, covering the temperature range of 300–1850 K
[52,276,583–586]. The measurements by Jin et al. [52], Tranter et al.
[585] and Dürrstein et al. [586] are close to each other. These rate co-
efficients are much higher than the estimation of Wang and Frenklach
[300], which were applied in a few literature models [559]. H-loss at the
ortho-site  of  biphenyl  forms  o-phenylphenyl,  its  subsequent  dehy-
drocyclization yields biphenylene. The conversion from o-phenylphenyl
to acenaphthylene was theoretically proposed by Shulka et al. [583,587,

The reactions of benzyne are missing in PAH formation. The com-
bination  of  benzyne  and  vinylacetylene  can  form  naphthalene  and
naphthyl  radicals  [589].  The  self-reaction  of  benzyne  leads  to  biphe-
nylene (BPE, R176) [585]; a second benzyne addition to biphenylene

5.2. RSR pathways

5.2.1. RSR combination reactions

The  combination  reaction  of  two  propargyl  radical  has  been  sub-
stantiated to form benzene or phenyl + H in a list of modelling work of
the combustion of aliphatic hydrocarbons [7,611–619]. Synergistic ef-
fects  on  the  formation  of  PAHs  and  soot  in  co-flow  diffusion  flames
fueled by the binary mixture of methane/ethylene [620,621] and eth-
ylene/propane  [622]  provided  further evidence  on the  importance  of
propargyl recombination in aromatic formation. Varieties of energized
linear C6 adducts can be formed in propargyl recombination, and each
can further isomerize among various forms, dissociate into bimolecular
products or back into the reactants [623–626]. Fulvene and 2-ethynyl-1,
3-butadiene  channels  were  proposed  as  byproducts,  and  can  easily
convert  to  benzene  [423,627].  Related  rate  coefficients  were  recom-
mended  in  a simplified  scheme  [625,628],  which  are  suitable for  the
application in typical flames, except very high-pressure [624]. Propargyl
mechanism has been extended the aryl-substituted propargyl radicals, e.
g.  1-phenyl-propargyl  (A1C3H2,  R179  and  R180)  [611,629],  but  only
considers the benzene channel.

Self-combination  reaction  of  cyclopentadienyl  is  sensitive  in  the
formation of naphthalene [188,208], which suggested its critical role in
PAH growth. This reaction thus has received a series of experimental
[630,631] and theoretical [57,70,406,423,632–634] investigations for
its  reaction  kinetics  and  rate  coefficients.  Global  reaction  of  C5H5  +
C5H5  = A2  + H2  or C5H5  + C5H5  = A2  + 2H and the later suggested
two-step scheme (fulvalanyl, fC10H9, R181; azulanyl, aC10H9, R182; and
R183) [70,423,615,632,634] may overestimate its reactivity in kinetic
models [70]. Recent study of Long et al. [70] argued that all previous
description of this reaction leading to naphthalene and two H-atoms was
not adequate for its chemistry in conditions relevant to pyrolysis and
steam  cracking.  C–H  bond  scission  of  C10H10  isomer  is  highly  endo-
thermic. The lifetime of C10H10 species, either fulvalanes and azulanes,
is  long  enough  to  undergo  H-abstraction  reactions  heading  for  C10H9
PES (R185), which is more important at higher pressures. The net effect
of  this  analysis  concluded  that  naphthalene  formation  via  cyclo-
pentadienyl recombination consumed three radicals (two C5H5 and one
abstracting radical in R185) while just released one H-atom at low to
intermediate  temperatures.  This  is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  previous
scheme, since the previous scheme converts two relatively stable C5H5
radials to two more reactive H-atoms.

yields triphenylene (TPE, R177) [234,590]. Comandini and co-workers
[591,592]  suggested  the  formation  of  naphthalene  and  acetylene  by
benzene + benzyne reaction (R178). Such combination reaction may be
extended to the formation of pentacene, benzo[b]chrysene, and benzo
[e]pyrene, etc. [592].

Phenyl addition-dehydrocyclization (PAC) was proposed in several
studies [583,587,588,594,595], which was later validated by elemen-
tary reaction experiments [593,596]. The reactions of phenyl + naph-
thalene  and  phenyl  + biphenyl  produce  fluoranthene  (fC16H10)  and
triphenylene  (TPE),  as  shown  in  Fig.  33,  respectively,  as  well  as  the
intermediates  of  1-phenylnaphthalene  (A2A1)  and  o-terphenyl  (oP3)
[593,596]. Phenyl combination describes the reaction of two aryl radi-
cals  with  “free”  periphery,  which  is  different  from  those  constrained
aromatic  periphery  types,  “zigzag”,  “armchair”,  “cove”  and  “fjord”.  On
the  contrary,  PAC  describes  the  phenyl  reaction  with  “zigzag”  and
“armchair”  periphery types. Phenylnaphthalene and terphenyl isomers
are exactly the same as the aryl combination products. The selection of
phenyl addition C-site impacts the reaction kinetics.

5.1.3. Conversion from “C6” to “C5”

Shukla  et  al.  [451,597]  proposed  the  methyl  addition/cyclization
and  aromatization  (MACA)  as  a  growth  pathway  for  PAHs,  which  is
depicted  in  Fig.  34.  Methyl  addition  at  “zigzag”  and  “armchair”  pe-
riphery of aromatics fuses new rings. It should be noted that tetra-ring
has  higher  ring  tension  than  penta-ring,  therefore  the  cyclisation  to
penta-ring is commonly observed in flames [598,599]. Recent modeling
study on the α-methylnaphthalene pyrolysis suggested that the methyl
addition to the benzene ring is more efficient than its combination with
naphthylmethyl radical [237]. The penta-ring ring fused from 1,8-dime-
thylnaphthalene  is  a  more  reasonable  assumption  yielding  acenaph-
thene and acenaphthylene from naphthalene.

The addition of allene and propargyl to phenyl was proposed to form
indene  in  early  literature  [600,601].  Experimental  and  theoretical
studies concluded that indene was the main product at low temperatures
and pressures (<1 atm and <900 K), phenylallene and 1-phenylpropyne
are  mostly  formed  under  combustion  relevant  conditions  [74,181,
602–609]. The reaction of benzene and propargyl is also unlikely to play
a significant role in indene formation [74]. Although indene is not the
primary  products  under  combustion  conditions,  it  may  be  formed  in
significant amounts through secondary H-assisted conversion of 3-phe-
nylpropyne  and  phenylallene  at  > 1200  K  [610]. Combined  with the
conversion from “C5” to “C6” in Section 2.5, the MACA and C3-addition
reactions  are  then  integrated  to  the  benzene-based  PAH  reaction
network.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107638

H. Jin et al.

The combination of benzyl and propargyl (A1CH2  + C3H3  → naph-
thalene + 2H) was recognized as an important formation pathway for
naphthalene  in  the  combustion  of  aromatic  hydrocarbons  [209,638].
The  addition  of  propargyl  to  benzyl  firstly  produces  the  adducts  of
benzylallene  and  3-benzylpropyne  (A1CH2C3H3,  R192),  subsequent
H-loss  of  these  two  adducts  yields  1-methylene-2-indanyl  radical
(C9H7CH2, R193) [518]. Well-skipping channel of A1CH2 + C3H3 reac-
tion  towards  1-methylene-2-indanyl  radical  and  H-atom  (R194)  was
more  preferable  at  high  temperature  (>1500  K)  [518].  The  formed
radical rapidly loses another H-atom towards either 1-methyleneindene
(C9H6CH2) or naphthalene (R195). 1-Methyleneindene then converts to
naphthalene  by  either  unimolecular  or  H-assisted  isomerization  re-
actions (R196) [74]. Similar as the self-combination of cyclopentadienyl
[70], the yielding amount of H-atoms is also the key parameter of A1CH2
+ C3H3 reaction.

Jin et al. [50,515] and Mulholland and co-workers [539,635,636]
suggested the reactions of indenyl similar as cyclopentadienyl. The re-
action products of C9H7  + C5H5  may be phenanthrene and anthracene
[50,635]; those of C9H7  + C9H7  may be chrysene, benz[a]anthracene,
benzo[c]phenanthrene,  etc.  [50,539].  Krasnoukhov  et  al.  [637]  theo-
retically suggested the direct H-atom loss from indenyl-cyclopentadienyl
or  cyclopentadienyl-indenyl  for  benzofulvalene  instead  of  C14H11
isomerization for phenanthrene and anthracene. Isomerization channel
is  less  preferred  due  to  the  unstable  C14H11  radicals  at  temperatures
above  1000–1250  K  at  1  atm.  Benzofulvalene  further  forms  phenan-
threne or anthracene via H-assisted isomerization. Such reaction scheme
of indenyl may be introduced by the benzene ring on cyclopentadienyl.
C9H7 + C9H7 reaction may, therefore, also follow the reaction scheme of
indenyl + cyclopentadienyl.

Fulvenallenyl reacts with propargyl, cyclopentadienyl and itself to
produce  naphthalene  (R186),  biphenyl  (R187),  and  phenanthrene
(R188),  respectively  [373].  As  shown  in  R187,  all  these  are  ring
expansion  reactions  after  the  combination  of  other  RSR  with  fulve-
nallenyl  at  its  allenic  site,  methylene  absorption  ring  rearrangement
then  converts  penta-ring  to  benzene-ring  yielding  benzo-aromatic
structures.  Such  fulvenallenyl  reactions  were  further  extrapolated  to
benzofulvenallenyl  radical  in  recent  PAH  models  [50,234,237].  The
reactions of benzofulvenallenyl with propargyl, fulvenallenyl, and itself
are  proposed  to  form  phenanthrene  (R189),  benzo[ghi]fluoranthene
(BgF, R190), and picene (pA5, R191), respectively. Matsugi and Miyoshi
[211] estimated the rate constants of R186 and R188 from the propargyl
recombination reaction [624,625], considering the steric hindrance of
(cid:0) 0.3  [211].  Similarly,  the  rate
an  extra  aromatic  ring  to  be  (T/300)
constants  of  R189  –  R191  were  also  analogized  from  the  propargyl
recombination reaction, and the steric hindrance of benzofulvenallenyl
is estimated to be 1/15 [50,234,237].

The recombination reaction of two benzyl radicals produces bibenzyl
(A1CH2CH2A1,  R197),  which  is  proposed  to  form  phenanthrene  via
stepwise  dehydrogenation  and  cyclization  [211,212,639].  Recent

elementary  experiment  also  suggested  the  anthracene  formation  as
another reaction channel [640]. Rate coefficients of R197 have strong
negative  temperature  dependence  [641–643],  which  suggests  that
bibenzyl would decompose to two benzyl radicals at high temperature.
This postulated reaction sequence is not efficient for the formation of
phenanthrene, also because phenyl elimination channel is not consid-
ered for A1CH2CHA1.

exclusively indene. Combining with the tropyl formation via acetylene
and cyclopentadienyl reaction (R72), this reaction sequence is a typical
RSR  chain  reaction  pathway  based  on  “C5”  radical,  from  cyclo-
pentadienyl to indenyl. The reaction of benzyl + acetylene (R202) was
corroborated to form indene + H by various theoretical calculations [74,
181,369,603,646] and experiments [647]. Vinylcyclopentadienyl is also
proposed  as  the  indene  precursor  (R203)  [351,369,370].  Rate  co-
efficients  of  C7H7  RSRs  and  acetylene  calculated  by  Mao  et  al.  [369]
indicate that R202 has the highest rate coefficients, which are 100 time
faster  than  R201,  whilst  R203  has  the  intermediate  rate  coefficients
among C7H7 RSRs.

Matsugi and Miyoshi [211] suggested that the reaction of benzyl and
benzene produced benzylbenzene (A1CH2A1) + H and the reaction of
benzyl and phenyl produced benzylbenzene (R198) or α-phenylbenzyl
(A1CHA1)  + H  (R199).  The  α-phenylbenzyl  radical,  that  may  also  be
generated  from  the  H-loss  of  benzylbenzene,  cyclizes  to  fluorene
(fC13H10)  with  an  elimination  of  H-atom  (R200).  Couch  et  al.  [644]
experimentally confirmed R199, and further suggested phenyl addition
to α-phenylbenzyl may be another chemical activation reaction similar
to R199, clustering phenyls with benzyl structure.

The  concentrations  of  indene  and  naphthalene  are  significantly
higher  in  the  combustion  of  o-xylene  than  m-  and  p-xylenes  [142],
because o-xylyl has its specific feature analogous as benzyl in aromatic
growth. Indane and naphthalene are predominantly produced from the
methyl and acetylene addition to o-xylyl [142,154].

Raj  et  al.  [648]  presented  a  PAH  formation  pathway  initiated  by
propargyl addition onto naphthalene (R204), as shown in Fig. 35a. Jin
et al. [234] extended it the reaction between propargyl and naphthyl
(R205  and  R206).  R204  and  R205  produce  allenyl-/propargyl-naph-
thalene  (a/pC3H3A2);  further  isomerization  reactions  of  allenyl-/pro-
pargyl-naphthalene  and  3-naphthyl-propargyl  form  phenalene  and
phenalenyl (R207 – R209), respectively. Pyrene (A4) may be formed via
a  second  propargyl  addition  to  phenalenyl  (R210  –  R213)  [648].  Jin
et  al.  [234]  extrapolated  such  reaction  pathway  to  large  PAHs  with
“zigzag” periphery, as shown in Fig. 35b.

5.2.2. RSR chain reactions

Tropyl radical reacts with acetylene and forms indene (R201), which
again  derivates  indenyl  via  additional  H-loss  reaction.  Fascella  et  al.
[645]  identified  a  plausible  multistep  pathway  for  R201,  which  was
later  experimentally  validated  [56,260].  No  evidence  shows  the  for-
mation of C9H9 species, the product of tropyl and acetylene reaction is

mation pathways from “C5”, “C6”, “C7”  and “C8”, which consist of the
basic PAH reaction map in Fig. 38.

Fig.  38a  summarizes  the  possible  mass  growth  pathways  from
cyclopentadienyl, which converts “C5” to “C5”, “C6”, “C7”, and “C8”. As
measured in the flow reactor pyrolysis of cyclopentadiene [433], PAH
products  occupy  around  82%  of  carbon  flux  at  high  temperature.  In
particular, both the two modeling work of Djokic et al. [188] and Yuan
et al. [208] illustrated the significant role of C5H5 + C5H6 reactions in
the prediction of these high yield aromatic species. Benzene, naphtha-
lene and indene were observed as the major mass growth products in the

Jin  et  al.  [379]  experimentally  confirmed  the  quantum  chemical
proposal  by  Maranzana  et  al.  [380]  that  the  butadiyne  addition  to
propargyl forms fulvenallenyl. Jin et al. [379] further suggested a sec-
ond  butadiyne  addition  to  fulvenallenyl  yielding  5-/6-ethynylindenyl
without releasing an H-atom, as shown in Fig. 36. Quantum chemical
results  suggested  cyclopentadienyl  to  be  a  main  product  of  indenyl
decomposition [513]. Previous models also assumed that indenyl can be
produced via the reaction of cyclopentadienyl and butadiyne [50,208,
211,239,431,575].

The chemical kinetics of C5H5 + C5H6 reaction has been theoretically
studied frequently [633,649–651]. Indene is observed as the major re-
action  product  (>50%)  of  C5H5  + C5H6  reaction  under  the
combustion-relevant  temperatures  [189,433,633,649–651].  Cavallotti
et  al.  [651]  supplemented  styrene  and  benzene  formation  via  the
ring-opening reaction channels towards vinylfulvene, phenylbutadiene.
Djokic et al. [188] measured significant production of indene, styrene,
and benzene in the pyrolysis of cyclopentadiene, and revealed the great
positive sensitivities of these reaction channels. Summarized in Fig. 37a,
the reaction of cyclopentadienyl and cyclopentadiene is a typical RSR
chain  reaction,  in  which  indene  is  formed  and  further  converted  to
indenyl (a large “C5”  RSR). RSR chain reaction of cyclopentadienyl is
able to be extrapolated to other “C5” RSRs. Fig. 37b presents the similar
reaction scheme for the addition of indene to indenyl, which is proposed
in indene pyrolysis studies of Jin et al. [50,515] and Lu and Mulholland
[539]. Similarly, the reactions of indene addition to cyclopentadienyl
and cyclopentadiene addition to indenyl are proposed for fluorene and
benzoindene formation [50,515,635], as shown in Fig. 37c.

5.3. Predictive PAH kinetic model

5.3.1. Basic PAH reaction map

Different  basic  aromatic  structures,  “C5”,  “C6”,  “C7”,  and  “C8”  in
Section 2, have their specific characteristics in PAH chemistry. Previous
experimental and modeling studies on cyclopentadiene [188–190,261,

condition, the reactions of benzyl and fulvenallenyl radicals (“C7”) are
characteristic  PAH  formation  pathways  in  the  combustion  of  toluene
and other methylated aromatics [110,208,211,212,436]. In Fig. 38c, the
addition reactions of acetylene, propargyl, and phenyl to benzyl lead to
indene,  naphthalene  and  fluorene,  respectively  [211].  Unimolecular
decomposition of benzyl produces fulvenallenyl, which is a precursor of
phenanthrene, naphthalene, and biphenyl, as shown in Fig. 38d. In the
flame condition, the oxidation of benzyl and toluene produces phenyl
and benzene besides benzyl and fulvenallenyl, which thus promotes the
“C6”  chemistry. Such “C7”  reaction scheme may extend to PAHs with
similar characteristic structures in molecules, e.g., naphthylmethyl. Jin
et al. [234,237] comprehensively investigated the pyrolysis of α-meth-
ylnaphthalene, and summarized the PAH formation reaction map just
similar to that of toluene. The combination reactions of naphthylmethyl
and naphthyl are similar to those of benzyl and phenyl. The additional
benzene  ring  in  naphthyl  and  naphthylmethyl  creates  extensive  aro-
matic  periphery,  which  leads  to  similar  but  specific  PAH  formation
pathways.  The  RSR  combination  reactions  of  benzo-fulvenallenyl  are
proposed to be similar to those of fulvenallenyl, due to the similar mo-
lecular structure [234,237]. Numerous product isomers are introduced
in this process by the additional benzene ring.

“C8” aromatics, typically styrene and phenylacetylene, play the roles
of both “C6” and “C2” in the PAH formation pathways, as recommended
by Yuan et al. [114] and Sun et al. [49]. In the pyrolysis condition, the
majority of phenylacetylene is converted to phenyl (“C6”  role), which
then reacts with phenylacetylene (“C2” role) itself for the formation of
diphenylacetylene and phenanthrene. The ethynylphenyl radical (“C6”
role) derived from the H-abstraction reactions undergoes combination
reactions for pyrene formation, which was measured in shock tube py-
rolysis of phenylacetylene [49]. In the styrene flame [114], benzene and
phenylacetylene  are  the  two  major  intermediates.  Similar  to  phenyl-
acetylene, diphenylacetylene, phenanthrene and pyrene are the major
PAH  products  in  styrene  combustion  process,  particularly,  stilbene  is
yielded  by  the  reaction  of  phenyl  and  styrene.  Other  products,  like
biphenyl and naphthalene, also follow the PAH reactions of “C6”.

5.3.2. PAH formation in aromatic combustion

Benzylic mechanism limits the PAH formation chemistry to benzyl
and styrene in the combustion of alkylbenzenes. Fig. 39 compares the
mole  fractions  of  indene  and  naphthalene  by  experimental  measure-
ments and model predictions in the premixed flames of toluene [208],
ethylbenzene [111], n-propylbenzene [144], and n-butylbenzene [152].
The mole fractions of indene and naphthalene increase with the length
of the substituents, from toluene to n-butylbenzene. In toluene flame,
benzyl  is  the  dominant  precursor  of  indene  and  naphthalene,  via  the
combination reactions of benzyl + acetylene and benzyl + propargyl.
Acetylene and propargyl are derived via the decomposition of benzene
ring. In ethylbenzene flame, both benzyl and styrene are involved in this
process due to the one more C-atom. Styrene is formed abundantly in the
rich ethylbenzene flame, as well as benzyl and methyl. Comparing to
toluene flame, methyl and acetylene are easier to obtain in ethylbenzene
flame.  The  reactions  methyl  + styrene  and  acetylene  + vinylphenyl
further promotes the formation of indene and naphthalene. As the length
of the alkyl substituent increases, n-propylbenzene and n-butylbenzene
flames  produce  more  methyl  and  ethylene,  leading  to  acetylene  and
propargyl. According to the detailed kinetic studies in literatures [111,
144,152], strong synergistic effect among benzyl, styrene, methyl, and
acetylene  was  revealed  on  the  PAH  formation  in  the  combustion  of
alkylbenzenes.

Under  lean  conditions,  n-propylbenzene  flame  is  able  to  produce
indene instead of naphthalene, n-butylbenzene flame is able to produce
both of them. This is because the formation pathway in lean flame is
totally different from the pathway in rich flame. Benzyl, styrene, methyl
and  ethylene  are  rapidly  oxidized  in  lean  condition,  the  only  minor
formation pathways of indene and  naphthalene are the  cyclization of
phenylalkenes,  e.g.  phenylpropene  and  phenylbutene.  That’s  why  we

combustion of cyclopentadiene [188,261,433,636]. Jin et al. [50,515]
further extended the “C5” chemistry to indenyl, and suggested the PAH
growth pathways from indenyl to be the conversion to “C5”, “C6”, “C7”,
“C8”, and acenaphthylene (“ace-C2”). “ace-C2” is another common mo-
lecular structure of “C8” in PAHs, the substituents of “C8” species may
easily  cyclize  to  a  new  penta-ring  forming  “ace-C2”,  because  of  the
“zigzag” periphery in PAH. But different from “C5”, “ace-C2” is not able
to yield a RSR via H-elimination. RSR combination reaction provides the
main carbon flux in PAH growth, such as the combination reactions of
indenyl  with  propargyl,  cyclopentadienyl,  benzyl,  and  itself.  Particu-
larly,  phenyl-naphthalene  that  was  traditionally  considered  as  the
product of phenyl addition reaction, may also be produced by RSR re-
action [370]. RSR chain reactions from small “C5” to large “C5” are also
favorable.  The  crossing  reactions  of  C9H7  + C5H6  and  C5H5  + C9H8
contribute to benzo-indenyl, which is similar as C9H7 + C9H8 and C5H5
+ C5H6. Such developed kinetic model is able to capture the PAHs in
indene  pyrolysis,  especially  those  commonly  ignored  PAHs  with  odd
C-numbers [50].

In  Fig.  38b,  biphenyl,  phenylacetylene,  naphthalene,  acenaph-
thylene, and fluoranthene were identified as the main aromatic products
in benzene pyrolysis and combustion [147,153,201,436,443–446,448].
Benzene base reaction pathways, such as PAC, dominate PAH formation
in benzene combustion [153,200,202,436]. The reaction of benzyne and
benzene  also  considerably  contributes  to  naphthalene  and  acenaph-
thylene besides phenyl addition reactions [436,591,592]. Such reaction
scheme can be extended to all the aromatics of “C6” class, e.g. naphthyl,
phenanthryl, etc. PAH formation chemistry of “C6” is very different from
that of “C5”, RSR reactions are prohibited in such reaction system. RSR
related aromatic intermediates, such as toluene, indene, and fluorene,
have  low  concentrations  in  benzene  pyrolysis,  but  have  considerable
concentrations  as  much  as  naphthalene  in  benzene  combustion  [153,
446,448].  Phenoxy  radical  play  the  critical  role,  which  generates
cyclopentadienyl radical from benzene in the combustion. RSR reactions
then provides its contribution in the PAH formation processes of ben-
zene flames [153,448].

PAH formation pathways from “C7”  class presented in Fig. 38c are
revealed in the combustion of toluene in a series of experiments [110,
pyrolytic

find  the  maximum  concentration  of  naphthalene  in  the  lean  n-butyl-
benzene flame is much higher than other alkylbenzene flames and the
maximum concentration of indene is significant in lean n-propylbenzene
flame.

As  we  introduced  in  Section  3.1.3,  the  combustion  of  i-pro-
pylbenzene and s-butylbenzene is controlled by the “C8” chemistry. In
the  pyrolysis  of  i-propylbenzene,  Tian  et  al.  [223]  suggested  the
considerable amounts of methyl and styrene formation. The combina-
tion  of  these  two  intermediates  forms  indene,  as  well  as  the  phenyl
migration and cyclization of 2-phenylprop-1-yl [223]. Another methyl
addition  on  indenyl  then  lead  to  naphthalene  formation.  Meanwhile,
phenyl  addition  to  styrene  forms  stilbene,  which  then  converts  to
phenanthrene. In the pyrolysis of s-butylbenzene, similar isomerization
and  cyclization  processes  of  phenylalkene  were  proposed  for  indene
formation, as well as similar naphthalene and phenanthrene formation
pathways [219]. The minor difference is that both 2-phenylpropene and
3-phenylpropene derived from s-butylbenzene are possible for such re-
action sequence. In the pyrolysis of t-butylbenzene, the PAH formation
relies on the reactions of 2-phenylpropene, because both unimolecular
decomposition  and  H-abstraction  reactions  of  t-butylbenzene  yields
2-phenylpropene and methyl. In the pyrolysis of i-butylbenzene, benzyl
and 3-phenylpropene primarily derived from i-butylbenzene contribute
to PAH formation via similar pathways. Comparing to PAH kinetics in
styrene  pyrolysis,  these  s-alkylbenzenes  and  branched  alkylbenzenes
rely more on intramolecular cyclization of alkenylbenzenes.

Generally, xylene isomers have “C7” chemistry in their combustion

and  PAH  growth.  As  shown  in  Fig.  40,  self-combination  reactions  of
benzyl, fulvenallenyl and their derivates have considerable contribution
in the formation of phenanthrene and its methyl derivates. Comparing to
m- and p-xylene, the ortho-methyl groups of o-xylene significantly con-
tributes to PAH formation under atmospheric pressure, methyl addition
to xylyl yields o-methylstyrene that cyclizes to indene; acetylene addi-
tion to xylyl yields naphthalene [226]. Similar PAH formation pathways
were also observed in the combustion of trimethylbenzene [132,652].
However, the structure of ortho-methyl group can also be created in the
dimerization processes of xylene and trimethylbenzene radicals. Besides
the benzyl + benzyl dimerization mode in the o-xylene model of Yuan
et  al.  [226],  the  benzyl  + methylphenyl  dimerization  mode  was  sug-
gested by Mitra et al. [652] and Gudiyella et al. [131,132] to be more
efficient under high temperature combustion. For example, the dimer-
ization of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene radicals may have four methyl groups
on  its  dimer  molecular,  one  or  more  methyl  may  locate  at  ortho-site
which  benefits  the  further  cyclization  to  anthracene  and  its  methyl
derivates. Such benzyl + methylphenyl dimerization mode may also be
extended to the combustion of m- and p-xylene [131] and 1,3,5-trime-
thylbenzene [132].

5.3.3. Reaction kinetics of large PAHs

Formation of PAHs that smaller than pyrene has been introduced in
the  combustion  of  various  hydrocarbons  [4,26,63,184].  SVUV-PIMS
[50,177,234,515,653]  and  GC–MS  [418,654,655]  expanded  our  PAH
knowledge to the molecular with five to six aromatic rings. Recently,

Mercier et al. [180] achieved a better identification of large penta-ring
and  side-substituted  PAHs  in  a  rich  methane  premixed  flame  using
advanced  i2PEPICO  technique,  particularly  for  those  active  aromatic
intermediates. The application of atomic force spectroscopy in the PAH
identification has further expanded our insight on the molecular struc-
tures of even larger PAHs. Chrysene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, benzo[a]
pyrene,  benzo[ghi]perylene,  and  coronene  are  the  large  PAHs  that
commonly detected in experiments [50,234,237,515,652,653,655,656].
They are peri-condensed aromatic hydrocarbons with even number of
C-atoms. Their formation kinetics are usually attributed to the dimer-
ization  of  small  aryl  radicals  with  following  addition  of  C2  or  C4  in-
termediates  and  the  recombination  of  RSR  radicals  [50,234,652],
Recent experimental studies also revealed the importance of aromatic
hydrocarbons with odd number of C-atoms (larger than C15) [50,234,
652]. C15H10 and C17H12 were measured in the flame of n-dodecane and

and  phenyl,

in the pyrolysis of indene and α-methyl-naphthalene. The C15H10  was
speculated  to  be  cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene  or  cyclopenta[cd]phe-
nalene, and was proposed to be the products of the recombination of
indenyl
closure  of
methyl-phenanthrene,  and  the  addition  of  butadiyne  to  1-naphthyl-
methyl.  C17H12  may  be  benzofluorene  isomers,  that  formed  from
indenyl reaction (Section 5.2.2). The molecular structures and reaction
kinetics remains unclear for the aromatics with odd number of C-atoms
larger than C19.

However, the invesitgations on the detailed combustion kinetics of
large PAHs were relatively very limited [23,184], especially in experi-
ment. On the oxidation side, the formation of aryl radicals from large
PAHs  were  theoretically  studied  [657,658].  Chaparala  and  Raj  [659]
found the oxidation of PAHs by O2 on its zigzag periphery is very similar
to that of phenyl radical, releasing CO and CO2. Ghildina et al. [660]

theoretically revealed the similar oxidation chemistry between benzo[b]
indenyl and cyclopentadienyl. On the aromatic growth side, the addition
of  small  combustion  intermediates  to  large  PAHs  still  contributes  to-
wards soot inception [661–667]. Zhao et al. carried out the flow reactor
experiments for the synthesis of pentacene [664], corannulene [663],
and helicene [665], which were still the repeatable HACA and HAVA
pathways.

Another reaction pathway for PAH radicals is their combination to-
wards  soot  nuclei.  Many  previous  investigations  were  performed
[668–673], mainly taking pyrene as a prototype. Wang [582] reviewed
that the large PAHs tend to evaporate rather than condense on the soot
nanoparticles at flame temperature; as the mass of monomer increases,
the  rotational  constant  decreases,  both  causing  the  entropy  of  dimer-
ization  to  decrease  further.  The  combination  of  two  σ-radicals  is  not
favored by thermodynamics, which supported by the molecular dynamic
simulation of Mao et al. [674]. Later models proposed a reversible PAH
clustering, which kinetically control the dimerization process [668,669,
675,676]. Experimental measurements by LIF provided strong evidence
on the existence of PAH dimers in the proximity of the soot nucleation
region in a methane laminar diffusion flame [677]. This study supports
the nucleation process to be kinetically rather than thermodynamically
controlled. But contrary experimental conclusions are also achieved in
recent  studies  [673,678].  Johansson  et  al.  [678]  investigated  the
dimerization of pyrene using aerosol mass spectrometer, and concluded
its  limited  importance  to  soot  inception.  Vitiello  et  al.  [673]  further
suggested that π-radicals were strongly involved during particle nucle-
ation, according to their electron paramagnetic resonance and Raman
spectroscopy measurements. Recent theoretical studies of Kraft and his
co-workers [23,670–672,679–681] also do not support the preference of
σ-radical dimerization, but emphasized the combination of RSR π-radi-
cals and the importance of PAH curvature. All the latter structures have
lower optical band gaps than flat peri-condensed aromatics of the same
size, which means the favorable in reaction thermodynamics.

6. Conclusions

This review has assessed the progress of the combustion chemistry
features  of  aromatic  hydrocarbons  in  the  last  decades  on  these  three
aspects  of  experiments,  quantum  chemical  calculations,  and  kinetic
model  developments.  Traditional  understanding  of  aromatic  combus-
tion chemistry was reshaped into fundamental aromatic chemistry, the
impact from alkyl-substituent and aromatic rings, and the benzene and
RSR  based  PAH  formation  pathways.  Cyclopentadienyl,  phenyl,  and
tropyl are considered as three basic functional groups in aromatic hy-
drocarbons, similar to OH and CHO groups in alcohols and aldehydes
respectively; their reaction scheme thus can be recognized as the “C0”
chemistry in aromatic combustion. Accordingly, the reaction scheme of
benzyl, toluene, styrene, and phenylacetylene can be recognized as the
“C1” – “C2” chemistry, which composes the core mechanism of aromatic
combustion.

Basic  functional  groups,  cyclopentadienyl,  phenyl,  and  tropyl,  are
relatively inert moieties in aromatic hydrocarbons, compared with OH
and CHO groups in alcohols and aldehydes. Common aromatic hydro-
carbons contain non-aromatic and aromatic moieties in the molecular
structures. The reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons usually occur on the
non-aromatic  moiety  instead  of  the  aromatic  moiety.  The  aromatic
combustion chemistry thus can be recognized as the chemical impact of
these basic functional groups on the combustion of common hydrocar-
bons, like paraffin, olefin, and naphthene, which is different from our
traditional  knowledge.  Benzylic  mechanism  is  such  a  characteristic
feature of alkyl aromatics and benzo-naphthenes in both high- and low-
temperature conditions. Phenyl group reduces the α-C-H/C–C bond en-
ergy,  which  raises  its  selectivity  in  initial  reactions.  The  yielding
benzylic RSRs, that relatively less active than normal radicals, further
influence the systematic reactivity of oxidation processes. With the in-
crease of benzene rings, such as from phenyl to naphthyl, the influence
of polycyclic aryl on the benzylic mechanism is usually quite weak in
aromatic combustion chemistry. Naphthylmethyl behaves similarly as

benzyl, and larger arylmethyl radicals would also perform similarly with
reasonable inferences.

On  the PAH formation, the mass growth processes can be divided
into two categories: the mutual conversion without fusing new aromatic
ring and the aromatic growth pathways fusing at least one new aromatic
ring. Besides the traditional PAH growth pathways via the addition of
small  unsaturated  combustion  intermediates,  phenyl  and  benzyne
addition  reaction are  new pathways  proposed the  direct dimerization
and aromatization of two PAHs. In addition, HAPaA mechanism intro-
duced  an  acetylene-assisted  pathways  for  the  clustering  of  two  PAHs
towards soot nanoparticles. RSR combination/chain reactions are also
recommended for PAH formation, which deeply involve the “C5” radi-
cals. The conversion from “C6” to “C5” via methyl addition reaction then
bridges the benzene- and RSR-based pathways. In a general view of the
aromatic growth and soot inception processes, the PAH oxidation and
nucleation  are  two  competing  and  sensitive  chemical  routes.  At  low
flame heights or early combustion stages, larger PAHs grow ahead of
lighter  ones  if  not  being  oxidized.  Non-sequential  growth  bypasses
traditional chemical–growth pathways under stepwise addition of small
unsaturated combustion intermediate, and occurs via the combination of
moderately sized radicals. Heavy aromatic structures are thus generated
that precipitate in soot inception and early-stage particle growth.

7. Perspectives

The compiled  knowledge  so far  would  highly benefit  a  systematic
understanding  on  the  pyrolysis,  oxidation  and  PAH  formation  of  the
basic  aromatic  structures  and  those  external  impact  from  the  sub-
stituents  and  the  aromatic  rings.  Despite  the  great  research  progress,
unresolved  aspects  in  fundamental  aromatic  chemistry  and  PAH/soot
formation  continuously  challenge  the  community.  Current  critical
questions and future prospects are summarized as follows.

i.  The chemistry from C5 to C8 in Section 2 is not a complete set of
basic functional groups for the fundamental aromatic chemistry.
Indenyl and naphthyl, or those larger aromatics with more aro-
matic rings but similar molecular structures, can be analogized to
cyclopentadienyl and phenyl in reaction chemistry. But phena-
lenyl,  is  another  “C0”  only  for  the  species  larger  than  tricyclic
aromatic  level,  a  hexagonal  π13-resonance  [234].  Up  to  now,
numerous  studies  have  investigated  the  reaction  kinetics  of
cyclopentadienyl  and  phenyl,  but  few  have  investigated  tropyl
and phenanlenyl. “C1” aromatics besides toluene (benzyl) do not
attract sufficient investigations, such as methyl-cyclopentadiene,
methyl-cycloheptatriene,  and  their  radicals.  Their  reaction  ki-
netics remains unclear if they behave like “C1” or “C0” chemistry.
Acenaphthylene is a “ace-C2” aromatic, and is the representative
of  those  aromatic  hydrocarbons  with  a  fully  conjugated  cyclo-
pentadiene structure in the molecule but different from indene.
Vinyl-cyclopentadienyl, fulvenallene, and fulvenallenyl are “C3”
aromatics substituted by cyclopentadienyl, and 1- and 2-phenyl-
propene are also “C3” aromatics but substituted by phenyl. They
have almost the same molecular structures as allyl, allene, and
propargyl.  All  these  “C0”-“C3”  chemistry  are  worthy  for  future
research  to  fulfil  our  fundamental  knowledges  on  aromatic
combustion.

ii.  High temperature aromatic oxidation reactions by O2, O, and OH
lack systematic investigation, particularly the reactions occurring
on  the  aromatic  ring,  “C1”  aromatics  like  xylyl,  etc.,  and  “C2”
aromatics  like  styrene,  phenylacetylene,  etc.  Despite  these  pri-
mary  oxidation  reactions,  the  subsequent  decomposition  chan-
nels of those primary products are not well known yet. Similarity
and analogy rules are required to allow for an extension of the
predicted outcomes to PAH and soot oxidation mechanisms [339,
682].

iii. An extensive study of benzylic mechanism is required on its ef-
fects  of  the  phenyl  position  and  branched  alkanes.  Alke-
nylbenzene  is  another  class  of  aromatic  hydrocarbons  besides
alkylbenzene  and  benzocycloalkane.  No  experimental  or  theo-
retical investigations have been reported up to now on its accu-
rate  reaction  kinetics,  particularly  the  synergistic/competitive
effect  between  the  unsaturated  bond  and  β-site  phenyl  group.
With the increasing rings of the aromatic group, it is still unclear
that to what extent the aromatic group effect would remain the
same  or  any  new  features  would  be  introduced  due  to  various
aromatic periphery types.

iv.  Low temperature combustion kinetics of alkylbenzenes with long
alkyl  chain  and  multi-substituted  alkylbenzenes  is  crucial  in
future study. o-Xylylic mechanism may enhance the isomeriza-
tion from ROO to QOOH on the nearby “free” periphery of aro-
matics.  With  the  increasing  rings  of  the  aromatic  group,  it  is
necessary to explore if any new features would be introduced in
due  to  various  aromatic  periphery  types,  like  ROO  to  QOOH
isomerization  over  “zigzag”  periphery.  Theoretical  studies  are
encouraged  to  explore  the  potential  energy  surface  of  low-
temperature  oxidation  of  aromatic  hydrocarbons,  to  determine
new reaction classes and to estimate accurate rate constants. As
shown  in  this  review,  further  reactions  of  those  primary  low-
temperature  oxidation  products  remain  unknown,  all  such
studies are necessary to improve the chemical kinetic models and
the knowledge of the community.

v.  For the PAH formation processes, recent studies have shifted the
focus from small combustion intermediates onto relatively bigger
ones, such as phenyl [593], fulvenallenyl [50,373], benzyl [640],
phenylacetylene
[50],
benzo-fulvenallenyl  [234,237],  naphthylmethyl  [234,237],  etc.
RSRs  are  involved in  the PAH  formation via  their  combination
and  radical  chain  reactions  beyond  traditional  benzene-based
pathways  [351,370,379].  The  self-combination  reactions  of
RSRs  attracted  more  literature  investigations,  but  the  cross-
–combination reactions of different RSRs are also promising for
large PAHs. RSR chain reactions may elucidate the soot formation
in the  post combustion region. It consumes less  H-radical  than
conventional pathways, has an easy activation step, and requires
an addition intermediate with high C/H ratio. Limited knowledge
on  RSR  chain  reactions  requires  further  investigation.  For  the
soot formation processes, HAPaA mechanism has introduced the
roles of side chains into the in the dimerization of peri-condensed
aromatic  hydrocarbons  [581].  The  clustering  of  large  PAHs  is
suggested  to  be  explored  beyond  the  direct  combination  re-
actions. So far, most of the PAH chemistry studies are based on
the  monocyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons.  Future  studies  beyond
bicyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  are  necessary,  considering  the
characteristic effect from different aromatic periphery types.

Beyond the fundamental aromatic combustion chemistry, engineer-
ing investigations are urgently needed to better understand the aromatic
combustion under the industrial applications, which benefits the ther-
mal  efficiency  and  the  pollutant  control.  For  internal  combustion  en-
gines,  industrial  reactors,  and  power  plants,  accurate  monitoring  of
combustion  processes  is  required  over  an  elevated  pressures  (1–300
atm) and a wide temperature range (550–3000 K), including chemical
speciation  and  physical  parameters.  Aromatic  combustion  model
development  under  industrial  scale  prefers  weak  stiffness  and  small
amounts  of  species  and  reactions,  which  indicates  the  necessary  ad-
vances in the constrain of model parameters, the optimization of model
predictivity, and the quantification of model uncertainty. Particularly
for  thermal  energy  conversion  of  biomass,  coal  and  municipal  solid
waste, etc., aromatic combustion chemistry has to be expanded to those
aromatic  alcohols,  aldehydes,  esters,  and  ethers,  and  aromatics  with
sulfur, phosphorus, and halogen.
