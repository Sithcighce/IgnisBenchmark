Biofuels from biomass gasification are reviewed here, and demonstrated to be an attractive option.
Recent progress in gasification techniques and key generation pathways for biofuels production, pro-
cess design and integration and socio-environmental impacts of biofuel generation are discussed,
with the goal of investigating gasification-to-biofuels’ credentials as a sustainable and eco-friendly
technology. The synthesis of important biofuels such as bio-methanol, bio-ethanol and higher alco-
hols, bio-dimethyl ether, Fischer Tropsch fuels, bio-methane, bio-hydrogen and algae-based fuels is
reviewed, together with recent technologies, catalysts and reactors. Significant thermodynamic stud-
ies for each biofuel are also examined. Syngas cleaning is demonstrated to be a critical issue for bio-
fuel production, and innovative pathways such as those employed by Choren Industrietechnik,
Germany, and BioMCN, the Netherlands, are shown to allow efficient methanol generation. The con-
version of syngas to FT transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co or Fe catalysts is
reviewed and demonstrated to be a promising option for the future of biofuels. Bio-methane has
emerged as a lucrative alternative for conventional transportation fuel with all the advantages of nat-
ural gas including a dense distribution, trade and supply network. Routes to produce H2 are discussed,
issues such as storage, expensive production routes with low efficiencies remain.
though critical
Algae-based fuels are in the research and development stage, but are shown to have immense poten-
tial to become commercially important because of their capability to fix large amounts of CO2, to rap-
idly grow in many environments and versatile end uses. However, suitable process configurations
resulting in optimal plant designs are crucial, so detailed process integration is a powerful tool to
optimize current and develop new processes. LCA and ethical issues are also discussed in brief. It is
clear that the use of food crops, as opposed to food wastes represents an area fraught with challenges,
which must be resolved on a case by case basis.

1. Introduction

PThe twenty-first century has been marked by an exemplary
advancement in the fields of information, technology, research and
development (R&D) coupled with an enhancement in standards of
living. However, the other side of the coin is rising population and
increasing energy demand. A large amount of energy (104.67 PWh
on primary energy basis) was utilised by around 7.18 billion people
around the globe in 2013 and this consumption will rise to 262.8
PWh in the near to medium term future (2050) [1,2]. In 2011,
almost 85% of the energy demand was satisfied by the fossil fuels
[1,2]. In the light of their non-replenishable nature and their contri-
bution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, researchers are search-
ing for sustainable green fuels. A significant growth in energy
demand calls for non-polluting renewable energy sources such as
solar, wind and biomass.

PBiomass is a renewable energy resource which comprises carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, traces of nitrogen and some minerals. Biomass
utilization has an advantage over other renewable sources such as
solar energy, wind energy and hydroelectric power because of its
low dependence on site and climate as diverse biomasses can grow
in varied conditions. Moreover, biomass can be easily stored and
transported (albeit with a lower energy density than fossil fuels).
Rural areas in under-developed countries are dependent upon bio-
mass for essential activities such as cooking and heating. For exam-
ple, India has considerable coal reserves of around 223 billion
tonnes, but they are located in specific areas such as north-east
India, unlike biomass, which is evenly and broadly spread over the
whole country [3]. Furthermore, easy availability of waste biomass
as a low-cost fuel make it a promising global energy source. Devel-
oped nations are also focusing on biomass as a sustainable energy
option because of these benefits.

PPlant biomass was the first fuel used by humans. The nineteenth
century saw fossil fuels allow industrialization and biomass was to a
significant extent displaced. On the other hand, fossil fuels have cre-
ated grave environmental issues such as climate change, due to CO2
emissions [4], and major pollution problems worldwide. In the light
of depleting easily accessible and cheap coal resources and oil reser-
voirs, it is imperative to shift our focus back to biomass, although
underground gasification might help extend the use of coal. Cur-
rently biomass provides more than 10% of the global energy supply
making it one of the leading potential viable renewable energy
resources [5(cid:1)7].

PThe carbon cycle associated with biomass production and end
use must match up the longer time scales (annual for agricultural
residues and grassy energy crops and of the order of three years for
woody short rotation energy crops) of carbon absorption in the
growing phase with the rapid production of CO2 during the combus-
tion phase. This is essentially the same requirement as ensuring a
secure and sustainable feedstock supply. Much can be learnt from
the sustainable timber and pulp and paper industries which have
been managing exactly this problem for many decades. This issue is
elaborated on further in Section 11.4 on lifecycle assessment.

PAn extensively explored research area is the development of
clean and sustainable technologies to utilize biomass feedstocks to
produce biofuels [8]. Biofuels are liquid or gaseous fuels produced

Pfrom biomasses which are predominantly employed in the trans-
portation sector. They are also used to generate heat and electricity
or can be used as the feedstock to synthesise important chemicals.
Gaseous biofuels are normally used for heat and power production,
whereas liquid biofuels are generally employed in the transporta-
tion sector. Biofuels, in general, include bio-methanol (MeOH), bio-
ethanol (EtOH), bio-dimethyl ether (DME), synthetic natural gas
(bio-methane), Fischer Tropsch (FT) fuels and H2.

PBiofuels can be classified as first generation, second generation,
third generation and fourth generation biofuels [9]. Their composi-
tion and calorific content are dependent upon the type of biomass
and process employed [10]. First generation biofuels such as bio-
methanol, bio-ethanol, bio-propanol, bio-butanol, fatty acid esters,
etc., are derived from simple sugars, starch, fats and vegetable oils
[11]. Inderwildi et al. [12] stated that second generation biofuels,
such as EtOH are produced by the ‘biomass-to-liquid’ (BtL) route
employing lignocellulosic biomass. The third and fourth generation
of biofuels products use the ‘algae-to-biofuel’ strategy. In third gen-
eration technologies, algal biomass is treated for biofuel production,
whereas the fourth generation approach utilises metabolic engineer-
ing of algae for generating biofuels from oxygenic photosynthetic
microbes and creating artificial carbon sinks [13]. All the generations
of biofuels technologies are discussed briefly in Section 3.

PLignocellulosic biomass can be converted to chemical feedstocks
and biofuels via thermochemical or biochemical routes as depicted
in Fig. 1. In biochemical processing of biomass, using hydrolysis, sug-
ars and lignin are extracted from biomass and selectively processed
via biological and/or chemical routes for the production of chemical
intermediates or desired liquid fuels for transportation. It offers
selective processing alternatives which are not available in the other
pathways [14]. However, it is a more expensive and intricate tech-
nique than thermochemical processing. Conversion of biomass to
biofuels via biochemical pathways has been extensively discussed
elsewhere [15(cid:1)22].

PPyrolysis, gasification and liquefaction are commonly employed
approaches in thermochemical processing of lignocellulosic biomass
to biofuels [24]. Among the dominant thermochemical technologies,
biomass gasification (BG) is considered as most cost-effective and
efficient for lignocellulosic biomass conversion to bio-energy [25]. In
gasification, thermal degradation of lignocellulose at high tempera-
ture takes place and results in intermediates such as bio-oil and final
products such as syngas. The thermochemical unit is usually coupled
with a chemical and/or catalytic upgrading unit to convert bio-oil
and/or syngas to a wide range of potential biofuels [26].

PGasification technology is almost 100 years old. In the 1920 s,
cars in Sweden were powered by wood gasifiers owing to ample
wood biomass and lack of petroleum resources. During the Second
World War (1939(cid:1)1945), numerous studies were conducted to opti-
mize the design of wood gasifiers and enhance their performance
[27]. In the 1970 s and 80 s, about 40 companies around the globe
proposed to build gasification plants based on biomass, to generate
heat and power. Indicative yields of important biofuels via both
pathways are shown in Table 1.

PAdvances in gasification technologies and multiple uses of syngas
have permitted gasification to integrate with several industrial pro-
cesses to produce chemical feedstocks and generate power [29,30].

PIn addition, this progress has allowed the chemical efficiency of gasi-
fication to exceed 70% and electrical efficiency to exceed 40% in
high-pressure gasification combined with fuel cell power production
[25]. Furthermore, waste-to-energy (WtE) in rural areas is a promis-
ing approach for energy security development and landfill avoidance
[31]. This work briefly reviews pyrolysis and liquefaction thermo-
chemical routes for biofuel synthesis. In addition, biomass gasifica-
tion along with operational variables such as raw materials,
gasifying media, steam-to-biomass ratio, temperature and pressure
inside the gasifier, gasifier design and residence time are discussed
thoroughly in Section 3.

PBiomass-derived syngas, which acts as a raw material for differ-
ent biofuels production, contains many contaminants such as tars,
particulates (PM), alkalis, nitrogen, sulphur, halides and traces of
some other elements. Cleaning of these contaminants prior to their
feeding in catalytic reactors for biofuel generation is a crucial step.
Traditional and advanced cold and hot syngas cleaning technologies
are also reviewed in this article.

PIn the current age, biomass gasification employing steam as gas-
ifying medium has attracted much attention as it produces H2-rich
syngas, which can be used as a feedstock to produce multiple bio-
fuels via catalytic chemical synthesis [25]. In this work, engineering
dimensions such as reactor design, catalysts and pilot plant projects
for the production of bio-methanol, bio-ethanol, bio-dimethyl
ether, bio-methane, Fischer Tropsch fuels and bio-hydrogen via BG
are discussed in detail along with algae-derived biofuels, with an
objective to promote their sustainable synthesis and to scale up
their production.

PNumerous studies comprising thermodynamic analyses of bio-
mass gasification have provided significant guidance to predict the
impact of operational variables on the composition and calorific con-
tent of produced syngas. These equilibrium models provide satisfac-
tory information vis-(cid:1)a-vis syngas which is a raw material for further
catalytic chemical processing to produce hydrocarbon (HC) fuels.
Many times, the information regarding syngas composition deviates
from chemical equilibrium predictions on account of kinetic con-
straints [32]. We have reviewed various thermodynamic studies
about gasification and biofuel production to show how equilibrium
modelling advances the technology.

PA bio-refinery combines different processes and equipment to
transform biomass to biofuels and other valuable products. In other
words, bio-refineries are ‘a multiple product production system’
employed to maximize the overall economic value. Gasification-
based bio-refineries use syngas produced via gasification for the
integrated production of chemicals, materials and fuels. Understand-
ing of diverse areas is important for successful operation of a

Prefinery, including the biomass logistics and conversion kinetics, and
process energetics [33]. Theoretically, a bio-refinery can use a huge
array of biomass feedstocks, ranging from forestry waste to sewage
sludge to aquatic plants, for the production of worthwhile products
and energy [28]. Although the idea of a bio-refinery is comparable to
an oil refinery, the diversity in various biomass feedstocks necessi-
tates a variance in the approaches employed to convert feedstocks
into useful products [34]. Here, current research is reviewed and dis-
cussed in an attempt to promote the concept of process integration
via innovative designs, to exploit the variability in biomass compo-
nents and to increase the derived value.

PLiquid biofuels can potentially substitute for fuels produced from
existing coal and petroleum reserves. The high-temperature com-
bustion properties of both oxygenated and synthetic hydrocarbon
biofuels are quite similar to non-renewable transportation fuels and,
therefore, few alterations are needed in internal combustion (IC)
engine design or in the present transportation infrastructure [24,35].
In fact, bio-ethanol and bio-diesel are currently blended with
conventional fuels in spark ignition (SI) and compression ignition
(CI) engines, respectively, in many countries around the world.
Production of biofuels via sustainable pathways (e.g., by means of
gasification-derived syngas), can not only release pressure to supply
or import conventional petro-fuels, but also aid in the reduction in
GHG emissions and other pollutants. In spite of the huge volume of
research and development conducted in the aforementioned areas,
there is no all-inclusive review on biomass-to-biofuel production via
biomass gasification with an emphasis on associated areas. This
article will assist R&D efforts into the scale-up of biofuel production
via gasification plants.

2. Bioenergy around the globe

PBiomass has a very high potential among all the renewable sour-
ces to help satisfy world energy requirements in the future. As a
result of R&D and a push by governments around the world, the
application of bioenergy in the transport sector and for combined
heat and power (CHP) has risen in the past decade. In the 1990 s,
around 50 EJ of energy was obtained from biomass, which is around
9% of the total energy utilization around the globe, and approxi-
mately 3 EJ out of this was employed as transport fuels [1]. This bio-
mass utilization has increased every year and is projected to
significantly increase in coming years [28]. Favourable policies and
legislation by different governments and organizations have resulted
in increasing deployment of biomass for heat and power and bio-
fuels for transportation [36]. Investigations predict that the potential
share of bioenergy by 2050 will be around 100 EJ a¡1, which will
further increase to 190 EJ a¡1 by 2085, as depicted in Fig. 2 [28].
This reflects the vast potential of biomass-derived bioenergy, which
can not only contribute to alleviate the requirement for fossil fuels
but also lead the development of rural areas with lesser adverse
environmental impact.

PConventionally, biomass was directly combusted to obtain
energy and this practice is still the main route for using biomass in
many regions, especially the rural areas of under-developed nations.
Biomass has the potential to be transformed to other energy vectors,
such as liquids (biofuels), gases (syngas, H2, etc.) and electricity, by

Pusing modern technology and processes [37]. The use of such vectors
is frequently more convenient, economical and environment-
friendly than the direct combustion pathway. Sugar-cane conversion
to bio-ethanol (EtOH) in Brazil, CHP generation in Scandinavian
countries and co-combustion of coal and biomass in the Netherlands
are a few examples of advanced and efficient bioenergy generation
from conventional biomass [38]. Currently, in industrialized nations,
the focus is to design and develop technologies to produce biofuels
for transportation, heat and power generation employing raw bio-
mass, in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

2.1. GHG emissions vs. biofuels

PNet GHG emissions from biofuels are significantly lower than the
combustion of conventional petroleum-derived fuels [39]. However,
biofuel synthesis also generates GHGs in every step in the supply
chain, from the raw feedstock production, to transport, conversion,
to biofuels distribution and end application, as depicted in Fig. 3.
Therefore, lifecycle assessment (LCA) should be considered a vital
factor that needs to be addressed by further research.

PA few researchers [28] conducted an important study employing
a net energy balance approach on a life cycle basis to compare the
GHG emissions by gasoline and EtOH produced from a variety of
feedstocks. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the GHG emissions
by lignocellulosic biomass- and sugarcane-derived EtOH are on the
lower side. Production of biofuels from cellulosic biomass decreases
the burden on energy/food crops. In addition, it offers a cheaper and
ample feedstock for the generation of a variety of biofuels as dis-
cussed later in this article.

2.2. Energy security and rural development vs. biofuels

POil demand is increasing worldwide, necessitating a suitable sub-
stitute for conventional fossil fuels [40]. Production of energy via
biomass at local, national and global levels can allay the dependence
on politically and socially unstable international energy transactions.
Apart from this, there is a direct positive influence of biomass-to-
biofuel production on the development of rural areas. Rural areas,

Pespecially in developing nations, traditionally suffer from poverty
and are deprived of even the basic amenities. Establishment of bio-
mass conversion plants and bio-refineries, which are labor-intensive
in nature, can provide job opportunities to a large number of unem-
ployed people [41], improving the economy locally and assisting in
development.

3. Thermochemical conversion of biomass to 2nd and 3rd
generation biofuels

PAccording to Luque et al. [40] and Naqvi et al. [42], first genera-
tion biofuels are synthesised from edible crops such as wheat, sugar-
cane, soya bean, rapeseed, etc., using traditional technologies
available for biochemical conversion routes (fermentation/hydroly-
sis). Biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-butanol, 2,5-dimethylfuran along
with the biofuels obtained via catalytic cracking are examples of this
category. They are derived from food feedstocks, and cultivated in
arable land, which potentially increases upwards pressure on food
prices [40].

PNon-edible feedstocks such as wood, agricultural residues,
forestry waste and municipal and industrial wastes are the

Praw materials for second generation biofuels. They contain lignin
and cellulose and are known as lignocellulosic biomass. A few
examples of second generation biofuels are bio-ethanol, bio-
methanol, FT-diesel, DME, bio-hydrogen, etc. [43,44]. They over-
come the shortcomings of first generation biofuel synthesis such as
the usage of arable land and food crops. They are produced using
either thermochemical or biochemical pathways. The use of wastes,
etc. as feedstocks leads to processes which are more sustainable,
with lower negative environmental impacts as compared to first
generation biofuels [45]. Second generation biofuel plants around
the globe are shown in Table 2.

PThe third and fourth generation biofuels are derived from algae,
which is the most abundantly available potential feedstock. Chen
et al. [46] noted that algae does not require arable land for cultiva-
tion and is not an edible crop. In addition, it is fast growing with an
inherent benefit of producing oils which can easily be refined to die-
sel and a few components of gasoline. To produce third generation
biofuels, such as biodiesel, butanol, gasoline, methane, bio-ethanol
and jet fuel, biochemical and/or thermochemical methods are
employed [47]. According to Lu et al. [13], fourth generation biofuels
will be synthesised from algae which is genetically modified to

Fig. 5. Different generations of biofuels with their characteristics.

Penhance desired HC yields along with creating an artificial carbon
sink to make it a carbon-negative energy source. This approach is at
a very early stage of research [13,48,49]. Fig. 5 represents different
generations of biofuels with their characteristics.

PPyrolysis, liquefaction and gasification are prime thermochemical
conversion technologies to synthesise biofuels from biomass feed-
stocks, employing high temperature and in many cases high pres-
sure [11]. The underlying principle of thermal processing is to
reduce the oxygen content of the biomass raw material in order to
enhance the energy density and to create carbon-carbon bonds to
increase the molecular weight of the final HC fuel [24]. Upgradeable
intermediate products such as bio-oils (by pyrolysis/liquefaction)
and syngas (by gasification) are obtained by thermal degradation of
lignocellulose (for second generation biofuels) and algae (for third
generation biofuels). Generally, the thermal processing unit is com-
bined with a biofuel production (for example, FT synthesis) unit.
Bio-oils and syngas act as feedstocks for wide-ranging hydrocarbon
fuel generation [12].

PPyrolysis is the thermal degradation of a material in the temper-
ature range of approximately 350(cid:1)550 °C in the absence of oxygen.
A short residence time at these high temperatures generates vapour
phase products which condense when cooled, to form a blend of
compounds including acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters,

Petc., collectively called bio-oil [50]. Hayes et al. [51] found the
yield of bio-oil could be as high as 70% on a mass basis. It is a
cost-effective process which does not require comprehensive
pre-treatment of
input raw biomass [24]. However, the low
energy density due to high oxygen content, and the corrosive
nature of bio-oil render it unsuitable for fuel applications prior
to extensive treatment [52].

PAccording to Alonso [24], thermal degradation of large molecules
of biomass in the presence of catalysts, with longer residence time,
at a comparatively lower temperature range of 250(cid:1)450 °C and high
pressures (5(cid:1)20 bar) during liquefaction, produces unstable smaller
species, which form polymers, again known as bio-oil. Bio-oil pro-
duced by liquefaction has a lower oxygen content of 12 to 14% as
compared to bio-oil by pyrolysis and, therefore, less extensive proc-
essing is needed prior to biofuel synthesis [24]. However, this is an
expensive process on account of catalyst cost and high pressure
requirements [29,53].

PBiomass gasification is carried out in the presence of a gasifying
medium to produce syngas [29]. Syngas can then be upgraded to
HC fuels or chemicals via chemical/catalytic upgrading [54]. A
detailed sketch of biomass gasification is discussed in the next sec-
tion. Biomass gasification, pyrolysis,
liquefaction and hydrolysis
pathways to produce fuels and chemicals are shown in Fig. 6.

3.1. Biomass gasification

P3.1.1. Gasification chemistry

PGasification is the thermochemical transformation of solid or liq-
uid biomass into a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon
dioxide, methane, tar, water vapour, hydrogen sulphide and other
trace species whose fractions are determined by operational varia-
bles such as raw material characteristics, gasifying media (steam,
air, O2, CO2), temperature and pressure inside the gasifier, and cata-
lysts (if used). According to Bridgwater et al. [55] and de Lasa et al.
[25], gasification consists of many overlapping sub-processes, such
as drying, pyrolysis and partial oxidation and, therefore, comprises
reactions which are
complicated combinations of numerous
depicted in Table 3. Drying of the feedstocks takes place until 120 °C
and volatile species are generated below 500 °C. Gasification of char
can begin at around 350 °C. The heat supplied can be intrinsically
produced via exothermic combustion reactions or can be supplied
from outside sources [56,57]. A simplified gasification reaction can
be represented in Eq. (1) as below:

Biomass ! COðgÞ þ H2ðgÞ þ CO2ðgÞ þ CH4ðgÞ þ TarðlÞ þ H2OðlÞ

þ H2SðgÞ þ NH3ðgÞ þ CðsÞ þ trace species

ð1Þ

PThe entire gasification process is divided into primary, secondary
and tertiary reaction stages according to the reaction chemistry and
temperature ranges [58]. In the primary reaction regime, biomass
feedstock is converted to oxygenated vapour and liquid species
along with the production of H2O and CO2 below 500 °C. Fu et al.
[59] observed that primary pyrolysis vapours are monomers and,
therefore, have low molecular weight. During primary pyrolysis, no
chemical reactions take place among the organic species, and they
are significantly free of secondary gaseous cracking products. In the
secondary reaction regime, CO, H2, CO2, water vapour, gaseous ole-
fins, phenols and aromatics are produced from primary vapour and
liquid species in the temperature range of 700 to 850 °C. Tar pro-
duced during this stage generally consists of mixed oxygenates, alkyl
phenols, phenolic ethers, heterocyclic ethers and polynuclear aro-
matic hydrocarbons [29]. The remaining tars and gases undergo
methanation, steam reforming, water gas shift and cracking reac-
tions. During the tertiary reaction regime, CO, H2 and CO2 are formed
along with water vapour, polynuclear aromatics and liquid tar, from
850 to 1000 °C [60]. Huber et al. [29] reported that tar composition
is a function of temperature. It alters from mixed oxygenates to
phenolic species to polyaromatic species with rising temperature.
Secondary and tertiary reaction regimes yield soot and coke [61]. It
should be noted that the thermolysis of liquid and organic vapours
forms coke, whereas uniform nucleation of intermediates formed at
elevated temperature produces soot.

PYung et al. [62] and Goyal et al. [63] reported that water loss and
condensation during crosslinking reactions result in char formation,

Pwhich retains the structure of the original
lignocellulose. The
amount of char produced is an inverse function of the rising temper-
ature until 400 °C. Elimination of hydroxyl and aliphatic C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds,
and the removal of carbonyl and olefinic carbon groups enhance car-
bon density in char and result in its aromatization with increasing
temperature. Simultaneously with the aromatization process, con-
traction in the carbon structure also occurs beyond 500 °C [59]. Ele-
vated temperatures during gasification not only open pores in the
char morphology due to the release of volatiles, but also result in
char melting and fusion.

PLiao and co-authors [64] demonstrated that ash is formed during
gasification on account of the presence of inorganic species in the
biomass feedstock. Oxides of aluminium, calcium, iron, potassium,
phosphorus, magnesium, silicon and sodium along with residual car-
bon form the major constituents of fly ash and bottom ash. The pro-
portions of these oxides are dependent upon the quantity and
nature of the inorganic matter present in the raw material. Silicon,
nickel, lead, zinc, chromium, cadmium, potassium, sulphur, manga-
nese and copper are found in the ash separator exit. Volatile halo-
gens and alkali metals are present in flyash and wet scrubber ash.
The presence of these inorganics, therefore, decreases process effi-
ciency and should be taken into account.

P3.1.2. Raw material

PRaw biomass of all types can be used for gasification. Vassilev
et al. [65] classify biomass based on its biological diversity, as
follows:

Pi. Wood (cid:1) Numerous wood species including angiospermous,
coniferous, softwood, hardwood, barks, stems, chips, pellets,
sawdust, etc., come under this category. They form one of the
most commonly used biomass groups for transformation into
usable products via combustion, gasification, cogeneration and
co-firing due to the minimal presence of sulphur and heavy
metals.

Pii. Agricultural and herbaceous biomass (cid:1) These biomasses are fur-
ther sub-classified into three types, namely grasses and flowers
(bamboo, cane, switchgrass, etc.), straws (barley, corn, rice,
wheat, etc.) and other residues (grains, seeds, shells, husks,
bagasse, pulp, etc.). Agricultural residues such as rice husks and
bagasse are highly used biomass feedstocks owing to their year-
round availability and cost-effectiveness.

Piii. Marine biomass (cid:1) Aquatic plants and microorganisms such as
marine algae, macro and micro algae, weed, water hyacinth, etc.,
are potential raw materials for different kinds of thermochemi-
cal and biochemical conversion processes. Presently, numerous
research investigations (as summarised in Table 19) are carried
out to generate third and fourth generation biofuels from algae
on account of their fast growth, and intrinsic ability to produce
oils which have similar properties to biodiesel. Moreover, such

Pbiomass has the ability to be genetically engineered to yield
desired biofuel with negative-C emissions.

Piv. Human and animal waste (cid:1) Wastes including bones, meat,
chicken litter, pig manure, etc., form this category. A signifi-
cant volume of research has been conducted into the potential
for these wastes to be used to produce usable chemicals or
energy. For example, Heidenreich et al. [7] reported that pig
manure was used as a biomass feedstock to produce syngas
via gasification and the maximum calorific value was found to
be 7 MJ Nm¡3 in a 6 MWth capacity plant, employing a low-
temperature circulating fluidised bed (CFB) gasifier, which is
quite encouraging.

Pv. Contaminated and industrial waste biomass (cid:1) Municipal solid
waste (MSW), refuse-derived fuel (RDF), plywood, sewage
sludge, paper-pulp sludge, railway sleepers, hospital waste, etc.,
are examples of this kind of biomass. Numerous researchers
[66(cid:1)70] have successfully demonstrated the production of
syngas using these wastes in biomass gasification units.

Pvi. Biomass mixtures (cid:1) These aforementioned biomass categories
can be blended in any ratio to get a new biomass variety, which
can be employed for different conversion processes.

PBiomass feedstocks can also be classified based on their
source and origin as shown in Table 4 [28]. Numerous research
studies on gasification of biomass employing diverse feedstocks
demonstrated that reactivity, thermal decomposition kinetics,
and product gas composition and calorific value are functions of
the biomass feedstock [71]. Tar and char yields and characteris-
tics are also dependent upon the kind of biomass used and the
cracking routes [72]. For instance, it was found in experiments
that the maximum tar production was around 60% for paper,
35% for wood and only 30% for sawdust during the thermal deg-
radation process [73]. This demonstrates that the gasification
products are heavily influenced by the biomass material's chemi-
cal makeup, moisture and inorganic species [74].

PThe choice of a gasification system is a function of biomass feed-
stock character such as moisture, particle size or density, inorganic
content (ash) and toxicity. In addition, the amount of biomass to be
processed is also taken into account, for example, fixed bed systems
are suitable for small capacities whereas fluidized and entrained bed
systems are appropriate for medium size and large scale capacities,
respectively. Every gasification system has its pros and cons and,
therefore, feedstock with a character appropriate for a particular
gasifier should be employed to ensure high-quality syngas, cost
effective and efficient operation, and minimum environmental
impact.

PWater content in the biomass feedstock is the most vital parameter
as every kilogram of moisture needs around 2260 kJ of unrecover-
able energy to evaporate it [50]. In general, wood and low-moisture
herbaceous biomass with less than 15% water are suitable for con-
ventional gasification systems. Updraft fixed bed gasifiers (FXB) can
function efficiently with higher-moisture (up to 60% wet basis) bio-
mass as compared to downdraft FXB (25% wet basis). However, an
open top fixed bed gasifier developed by the researchers of Indian
Institute of Science is capable of using biomasses with high mois-
ture. Normally, a decrease in gasifier temperature and gas yield is
observed with an increase in tar content if the feedstock contains
more than 30 wt. % water [75]. Supercritical water gasification
(SCWG) is a potential gasification pathway for high-moisture-con-
taining biomasses such as algae, sludge, manure, olive mill water,
etc. High H2 yield coupled with high gasification efficiency (ƞ) and
low tar is obtained via this route. However, high installation costs
owing to the necessity of elevated temperature-pressure and rust-
resistant materials, and very significant energy requirements are
the limitations for this approach [76]. While this is a promising
technique for wet feedstocks further investigation is required to
bring it to commercial scale. Plasma gasification can also be
employed for these kinds of biomasses, although it shares the same
drawbacks as SCWG.

PParticle size or particle density of the biomass raw material is
another significant factor in choosing a gasification system and lies
between 0.15 mm to 51 mm for conventional gasifiers [77]. Agricul-
tural wastes such as rice husk, coir pith, bagasse in loose or powdery
form are commonly used as feedstock after pulverization, which
reduces the bulk density to 200 kg m¡3 [78]. Owing to a longer resi-
dence time for the fuel, fixed bed gasifiers are less prone to be influ-
enced by the particle size of the feedstock provided it is less than
51 mm, in comparison to entrained flow gasifiers. Entrained flow
gasification can tolerate up to 0.15 mm diameter particles and,
therefore, requires pulverization of fuel prior to gasification [77]. On
the other hand, this technology produces high quality syngas with
very low tar content. It is, therefore, normally employed for coal gas-
ification. The tolerance for particle size for FBG lies in the middle
(< 6 mm) [50]. It should be noted that although pulverization enhan-
ces the flexibility to use a diverse variety of biomasses it also
increases the cost as well as being an energy intensive process.

PBiomass raw material with low ash content (< 2%) such as wood,
is suitable for fixed bed gasifiers. High ash content results in a
decrease in conversion efficiency owing to ash agglomeration [79].
Herbaceous biomass such as bamboo, switchgrass, etc., and contami-
nated biomass such as sludge have high ash content and cause slag-
ging issues in downdraft FXBs, which are dependent upon low ash
melting temperature [80]. Ideally, a gasifier should operate either
below the flow temperature of ash to decrease slagging, or above its
melting point. Only a few gasifier designs (British Gas/Lurgi) encour-
age slagging where the slag forms a protective layer on the walls of
the reactor [77]. Moreover, the generated ash can be employed as a
pozzolanic material and can be blended with cement when produc-
ing concrete [81], reducing the requirement for cement and thus
decreasing the requirement for land fill.

PDevelopments in gasification systems in the past few decades
have made it possible to employ even hazardous or high-water-
containing feedstocks such as MSW, sludge, rubber, plastics RDF, etc.
Plasma gasification is one such pathway, which was developed to
destroy these kinds of wastes. Later, research and development
efforts improved the technology to generate usable energy through
syngas and electricity production. A high quality product gas with
low tar and CO2 content is obtained via plasma gasification. An
exemplary example of power generation from a toxic feedstock is
the Utashinai plant, Japan. It was installed in 2002 to treat MSW and
generate power. As of 2014, it takes 268 tonnes of MSW per day and
generates 7.9 MWh electricity [77].

PTorrefaction is one route to enhance the potential of some bio-
masses for gasification. It is a form of mild pyrolysis [82] which sig-
nificantly enhances the heating value and resistance to moisture of
the biomass. Heating at 200(cid:1)300 °C under an inert atmosphere leads
to preferential loss of moisture, hydrogen and oxygenated species
[83] and more “coal-like” material, potentially more suitable for
entrained flow gasification [83] is formed. The torrefaction of a large
number of different types of biomass materials has been investi-
gated; first of woody biomasses, but later of a much wider range of
biomass types [84]. The hemicellulose fraction of the biomass is ini-
tially converted, and higher fractions of hemicellulose lead to greater
mass changes. The mass yield of biomass after torrefaction ranges
from 24(cid:1)95%, with the energy density ranging between 1 and 58%
[HHV] higher after torrefaction, in one review [84] (the energy yield
ranged between 30 and 98%). Owing to their lower fraction of hemi-
celluloses, woody biomasses exhibit smaller changes in mass than
other types of biomass, with mass yields with few exceptions > 95%
[84]. Process integration can yield high energy efficiency for an over-
all process; simulations indicate upwards of 90% for the integration
of a steam cycle with a torrefaction plant, if the gases from the torre-
faction process are subsequently burned [85]. It is clear that this is a
promising technology that may enhance the potential of biomass for
use in subsequent gasifiers.

P3.1.3. Gasifying media

PThe operating conditions which are preferable for different bio-
mass types depend upon the type of gasifier used and the desired
quality of the final product, with the amount of tar in the product
gas being a primary concern. Gasification is carried out in the pres-
ence of a gasifying medium inside the gasifier. The gasifying medium
or environment can be air, oxygen, steam or carbon dioxide. The
heat content of the product gas is a function of the gasifier environ-
ment. The product gas from air gasification gives a heating value of
around 4(cid:1)7 MJ Nm¡3 on account of the presence of N2 in the air
which dilutes syngas and results in low calorific content [50,86(cid:1)88].
When the gasifying atmosphere is pure O2, the heating value can be
as high as 28 MJ Nm¡3 [89]. Steam or a combination of steam and O2
produces syngas of intermediate calorific value (10(cid:1)18 MJ Nm¡3)
[50,90(cid:1)92]. Furthermore, the blend of air and steam yields higher
quantities of H2 than air alone and also aids in decreasing the process
energy requirements. The gasifying atmosphere also plays a signifi-
cant role in transforming solid char and heavy hydrocarbons to
carbon monoxide and hydrogen [93].

P3.1.4. Equivalence ratio (ER) and steam-to-biomass ratio (S/B)

PThe equivalence ratio represents the actual air-to-biomass ratio
with respect to the stoichiometric requirement for complete conver-
sion and plays a key role in biomass gasification [94]. Studies [95]
showed that H2 and CO fractions in syngas were enhanced when ER
values were decreased. However, the yield of gaseous products will
decrease too when the ER is reduced below the threshold, which is
the initiation of pyrolysis. Higher ER results in lower H2 and CO
yields, with an increase in CO2, which in turn decreases the heat con-
tent of the syngas. By contrast, a higher ER improves tar cracking due
to higher O2 availability for volatile species to react with. However,
an insignificant influence of ER was found on nitrogenous products,
during gasification. Zhou et al. [96] reported a small increase in
ammonia (NH3) yield at 800 °C, using sawdust as the raw material
when the ER was raised from 0.25 to 0.37. In a fluidised bed, the solid
bed material (particles) along with gasifying agent forms a solid-
fluid mixture which behaves like a fluid and provides a platform for
heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical interactions to occur.
The temperature of the bed is a significant variable which influences
the gasification process. Bed temperature is a function of ER and
rises linearly with it, provided the feed rate is kept constant as the
increase in feed air enhances the extent of combustion which results

Pin higher heat release. However, an increase in feeding rates
decreases bed temperature keeping ER constant [25]. Some work
[95] has examined (among other parameters) the effect of increasing
the amount of steam at a fixed equivalence ratio (0.3) during gasifi-
cation of sawdust. Increasing steam amount led to more H2, better
LHV for the gas and lower tar; however, the authors did not consider
the increased energy requirements for raising the steam in their
analysis. ER is also impacted by the presence of moisture and vola-
tiles in the feedstock material [97,98]. Water content up to 15%
results in an increase in ER and gas amount, but above 15% causes
irregular temperature fluctuations. High volatile fractions in the bio-
mass feedstock produce higher tar yields. Biomass with a high pro-
portion of moisture or ash benefits from either co-gasification with a
higher heating value fuel if a syngas with a high heating value is
required or potentially from the use of oxygen enrichment. Roy et al.
[99] considered the co-gasification of cow dung (as an exemplar of a
low-quality fuel with a high ash content) and found an approxi-
mately 50:50 ratio of dung to biomass to be optimal in a downdraft
gasifier.

PNumerous research investigations [100(cid:1)104] have shown that
the ratio S/B is a key parameter in BG on account of its influence on
the syngas yield and heat content. Increasing the S/B results in more
H2 yield and, therefore, syngas with higher heat content. It also pro-
duces lower amounts of tar, due to water gas shift, reforming and
cracking reactions [95]. Sharma et al. [105] reported the existence of
a limit beyond which any increase in S/B produces excess steam in
the syngas. Energy contained in the excess steam along with the
enthalpy losses in generating this steam, result in low process effi-
ciency. Such issues demand an optimal S/B in steam biomass gasifi-
cation. The advantages and disadvantages of the various gasification
media have been explored by Wang et al. [106]; amongst those
highlighted above, the use of CO2 as a gasifying agent, similarly to
steam, requires an external heat supply.

P3.1.5. Gasifier temperature and pressure

PSeveral experimental and modelling studies have reported the
effects of temperature on char conversion, gas yield and composi-
tion, and tar production. A temperature greater than 800 °C results
in higher char transformation and lower tar yield on account of
higher conversion of carbon, volatile species and high molecular
weight HCs into gaseous products [107]. From this point of view, it
is desirable to have a higher gasification temperature [97,108,109].
Optimal ranges of temperatures were reported between 750 and
850 °C for gasification of agricultural waste fuels, 800 and 900 °C for
RDF and 850(cid:1)950 °C for woody biomass (in comparison to »1000 °C
for coal) [110]. However, the desire for lower ash accumulation
necessitates lower temperatures which practically restrict the tem-
peratures up to 750 °C during BG [32]. It is found that H2 yield at
equilibrium initially increases to a limit, then decreases, with a rise
in temperature [111]. Therefore, the optimal operational gasifier
temperature can only be determined after evaluating several key
parameters such as desired gas composition and calorific content, tar
yield and char conversion. Pressurized gasification of biomass was
studied by Knight et al. [112] and Wang et al. [113]. Higher pressures
with larger ERs result in the decrease of light hydrocarbons and tar
yield along with complete conversion of carbon. The quantity of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) increases with a rise in gas-
ifier pressure, although an overall decrease in the tar was observed.

P3.1.6. Residence time

PResidence time has an important impact on tar make-up and
yield and, therefore, on syngas quality. Milne et al. [114] and Zhang
et al. [61] reported extra production of gases, formic and acetic acids,
and water as a result of supplementary degradation of secondary
vapour phase species, which occurs due to longer vapour residence
time during pyrolysis. Furthermore, the quantity of tar reduces by a

Psignificant extent when the space time was increased for a dolomite
bed during gasification [115]. Kinoshita et al. [116] observed that
yield of O2-containing species is an inverse function of residence
time. Moreover, except benzene and naphthalene, fractions of all
1- and 2-aromatic ring species reduced with residence time
while 3- and 4-aromatic ring compounds increased, which in
turn has a significant influence on the outlet gas quality and
composition.

P3.1.7. Catalysts

PA significant number of investigations have been conducted over
the past few decades to develop biomass gasification and ensure its
successful installation and operation at commercial and industrial
scales. Banowetz et al. [117] reported the major barrier to achieving
this objective is the production of undesirable species, such as tar,
nitrogenous complexes, PM, alkali metals and carbon deposition on
catalysts. Tar is a blend of condensable aromatic and oxygen con-
taining HCs, which is responsible for downstream blockage and cor-
rosion along with the degradation in syngas quality [114]. Tar can be
cracked at elevated temperatures. However, an increase in the oper-
ating temperature also enhances ash agglomeration with a decrease
in process efficiency [118]. It should be noted that ash is a cause of
corrosion and alkaline metals are accountable for bed sintering and
defluidisation of fluidised bed gasifiers [119(cid:1)121].

PPrevious research [60,110,114,117,122,123] has demonstrated
the importance of catalytic tar cracking with respect to the process
cost and efficiency. Employing suitable catalysts (including any dop-
ants) not only reforms tar but also increases char gasification which,
in turn, results in higher and cleaner gas yield with improved calo-
rific content [124]. Presently, a number of investigations are being
carried out to develop more stable and active catalysts for gasifica-
tion, using Ni-based formulations, noble metal catalysts, olivine,
dolomite, etc. [122,125(cid:1)129].

PCatalysts can be used in the gasifier directly or may be employed
in another reactor placed downstream. The former method is called
primary catalysis, and some catalysts used here included, e.g., alu-
mina-supported Ni, olivine and dolomite, responsible for enhancing
steam reforming and water gas shift reactions [110,130(cid:1)136]. They
reduce tar yields and increase H2 and CO yields. In addition, they
prevent choking of the bed by reducing agglomeration. However, Ni-
based catalysts suffer from deactivation due to carbon deposition
[60,137]. Alternatively, product gases can also be processed by sec-
ondary catalysts (e.g., Ni-based catalysts, dolomite) placed in a cata-
lytic reactor downstream of the gasifier [123]. They can crack tar in
the temperature range of 750 to 900 °C and are, therefore, promising
for hot gas cleaning [125,137(cid:1)140]. However, employing secondary
catalysts enhances the syngas production cost considerably. On
account of cost effectiveness and reduction in process complexity in
downstream treatment of the product gas, primary catalysts are
seen as more promising and are attracting more attention for
research investigations [110].

P3.1.7.1. Ni-based catalysts.
PCatalysts based on Ni are extensively
used in commercial-scale steam and dry reforming processes [141].
As a matter of fact, they are the most commonly used catalysts for
gasification processes on account of their tar cracking properties and
their potential to improve the water gas shift reaction as shown in
Eq. (2). They decrease tar amount and enhance desired product gas
yield and quality. They are about 10 times more reactive than cal-
cined dolomite [136]. However, these catalysts are more active for
the steam reforming of heavy HC species (Eq. (3)) than lighter ones
(Eq. (4)), during catalytic gasification of biomass [125].

Biomasse Kraftwerk Gussing GmbH & Co. operates a biomass gasifi-
cation facility based on dual fluidised bed gasifier (DFB) where Ni-
based catalytic filters are employed in the gasifier freeboard to
reform tar at elevated temperatures and remove particulate species
from syngas [142]. Ni is undoubtedly a promising choice for biomass
gasification; however, it suffers from deactivation due to coking, sin-
tering, attrition and alkali metal and sulphur poisoning [143].

PCoke formation is an intrinsic characteristic of steam reforming of
biomass for hydrogen production. The elevated temperature during
reforming not only results in higher amounts of hydrogen but also in
coking. Carbon poisons the catalyst by forming bulky phases of
nickel carbides and by condensing nickel crystallites via inactive car-
bonaceous layers of material [129,144(cid:1)147]. Moreover, higher
molecular weight aromatic biomass raw material can also lead to
coking. One of the solutions for coke formation is auto-thermal gasi-
fication, where the rate of coke formation on catalyst equalizes the
coke removal rate by combustion [148,149]. Here, air fluidises the
biomass bed and catalyst and keeps it clean. Coking can also be mini-
mized to a significant extent by enhancing S/B with respect to gasifi-
cation stoichiometry. However,
it increases the energy penalty
making the syngas or H2 generation process expensive. A threshold
limit of steam-to-carbon ratio which should be sufficient to avoid
coke formation with minimal excess energy [150] is an important
parameter to be determined.

PNi catalysts suffer from attrition, in fluidised bed environments
due to severe process conditions as compared to fixed bed gasifica-
tion systems. The mechanical strength can be enhanced by impreg-
nating supports such as olivine [151]. However, even when using Ni
catalysts with a carrier material, some attrition is inevitable, since Ni
is present as a layer on the carrier [143]. Mechanical deactivation via
attrition is irreversible but can be eliminated by using appropriate
reactors such as fixed beds.

PThe overall catalytic activity of Ni-based catalysts is improved by
the use of a dopant or promoter along with a support phase. The
resultant nickel formulation is mechanically stronger and has a
higher resistance to coking and attrition [143]. Nickel-support inter-
action, pore structure of support and acidity-basicity of support can
have positive impacts on metal dispersion, crystallite size and coking
[152,153]. Lower nickel concentrations have better interaction with
the support phase, along with proper dispersion of metal [145]. This
dispersion is enhanced by adding a dopant to the formulation. It
should be noted that the presence of promoters and supports in
nickel catalysts lead to reduction of their deactivation during BG. A
detailed review concerning supports and dopants and their influence
on process variables for biomass gasification has been published by
de Lasa and co-authors [25].

P3.1.7.2. Other catalysts.
PUsage of olivine (magnesium iron sili-
cate), dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) and alkali-
based catalysts is considered promising in biomass gasification
and has garnered much attention in past years. Some research
investigations have been conducted for olivine and dolomite
vis-(cid:1)a-vis tar cracking. Catalytic activities of calcined olivine and
dolomite were evaluated in moving bed reactors by Hu et al.
[127] and it was found that calcined catalysts are more efficient
than non-calcined ones. Using a similar set-up, Devi et al. [154]
demonstrated an increase in tar cracking between 800 and
900 °C, employing calcined dolomite and non-calcined olivine.
These researchers observed that at a temperature of 900 °C,
all heterocyclic species are converted. Moreover, tar yield of
4 g m¡3 decreased to 1.5 g m¡3 employing calcined dolomite
and 2.2 g m¡3 using olivine.

POlivine and limestone occur freely in nature and, therefore, have
been employed widely for biomass gasification due to their cost

Peffectiveness. They are commonly used as bed materials in fluidized
beds where they suffer from attrition on account of intense process
conditions. Normally, limestones have shown higher attrition than
olivine or silica [151]. The attrition taking place during gasification is
dependent on the hardness factor measured according to Moh's
scale. However, the attrition of the bed material in a DFB is also a
function of the kind of particle separator after the riser as well as the
gas velocity [123,143].

PDolomite as a primary or secondary catalyst in catalytic biomass
gasification is a good choice on account of its efficient tar removal
capacity and cost effectiveness. However, it is mechanically weak
and prone to attrition [110]. A mixture of coal, pinewood sawdust
and plastic wastes was used as feedstock material by Aznar et al.
[126] to investigate the effect of dolomite as a tar reducing agent.
The flow rate was kept at 1(cid:1)4 kg h¡1, ER at 0.3 to 0.46 and bed tem-
perature between 750 and 880 °C. These authors obtained a product
gas with 15% (dry basis) hydrogen yield and tar content less than
0.5 g m¡3. This emphatically demonstrates the potential of dolomite
as an effective catalyst for gasification.

PAlkali metals such as potassium and sodium are normally present
in all kinds of biomass feedstock along with other inorganics and are
found in the bottom ash of gasifiers. During pyrolysis, these metals
can form a reactive char that can have an important influence on BG.
If ash is employed as a catalyst during gasification, then it can not
only aid in resolving the ash disposal issue but can also enhance the
gasification resulting in the generation of cleaner gas [128,155,156].
However, these metals when used as catalysts eventually lose their
effectiveness on account of particle agglomeration. Furthermore,
costly and complex recovery of catalyst coupled with ash handling
problems and enhanced char content post gasification, cause other
challenges when alkali metals are directly added as catalysts [123].
Interestingly, when a nickel catalyst was added with sodium carbon-
ate in rice straw gasification, generation of permanent gases were
considerably enhanced [157]. These researchers reported that the
generation of permanent gases is a function of the alkali metal car-
bonate employed.

P3.1.8. Gasifier design

PGasification of biomass is usually performed in one of two types
of gasifier, namely fixed bed (FXB) and fluidised bed (FB) gasifiers.
The FXB gasifier is again sub-classified as updraft, downdraft and
cross-draft, based on the flow direction of air [158]. Bubbling

Pfluidised bed (BFB), CFB and DFB are the principal types of FB gasif-
iers. Another gasifier type is the external circulating concurrent
moving bed, which is a relatively new design and is currently under
investigation. A final type, called an entrained flow gasifier, was
developed for gasification of finely refined coal and is not appropri-
ate for fibrous biomass [29].

PFixed bed gasifiers are the oldest and
P3.1.8.1. Fixed bed gasifiers.
most commonly employed reactors for the gasification of biomass
feedstocks on account of their simple design, easy operation, high
thermal efficiency and minimal required pre-treatment of raw mate-
rials. In commercial markets, FXB gasifiers are considered as the first
choice for small-scale gasification plants of less than 10 MW for local
power generation [50]. In the updraft gasifier, fuel enters from the
top end and gasifying agent from the bottom, and in downdraft both
fuel and gasification agent enter from the top with the fuel coming
in from a lock-hopper. In updraft gasification, the char at the bottom
of the bed meets the gasifying agent first, and total combustion
occurs, producing H2O and CO2 and raising the temperature to »
1000 °C. The hot gases flow upward, conducting endothermic reac-
tions with unreacted char to form H2 and CO, with consequent cool-
ing to » 750 °C. The gases pyrolyse the dry biomass which is
descending, and also dry the incoming biomass near the top of the
reactor. Updraft gasifiers typically produce 10(cid:1)20 wt. % tar in syn-
gas, which renders it unsuitable for many advanced applications
[50]. In the downdraft gasifier, gas flows co-currently with the fuel.
A throated downdraft gasifier has a restriction part-way down the
gasifier within which air or O2 is added, and where the temperature
rises to 1200-1400 °C, and the biomass fuel is burned/pyrolysed. The
combustion gases then pass down over the hot char at the bottom of
the bed, where they are reduced to H2 and CO. The high temperature
within the throat ensures that the tars formed during pyrolysis are
significantly cracked (homogeneous cracking), with further cracking
occurring as the gas meets the hot char on the way out of the bed
(heterogeneous cracking), leading to a less tarry off-gas. According
to Gordillo et al. [159] typical gas compositions of H2, CO, CH4 and
CO2 in updraft and downdraft gasifiers are found to be 5 to 15%, 20
to 30%, 1 to 3% and 5 to 15%, respectively. A comparative schematic
of updraft and downdraft FXB gasifiers is shown in Fig. 7.

PIn the cross-draft gasifier, feedstock is fed from the top of the
reactor whereas air is fed from the side of the reactor [25]. Product
gas exits the gasifier unit at the same level as the air inlet, but from

Pthe other side of the unit. Combustion and gasification take place in
the area of the air entrance with pyrolysis and drying zones toward
the top of the reactor. Ash is removed from the bottom and exit
product gas temperature is around 800 to 900 °C with higher tar
content.

P3.1.8.2. Fluidised bed gasifiers.
PFluidised bed gasifiers are highly effi-
cient and hence form the first choice for very large scale biomass
gasification. Air is circulated through a bed of fine particles, for
example, sand, resulting in bed fluidisation. This ensures uniform
heat and mass transfer among bed material, biomass fuel and hot
gases during the gasification. It also enables the gasifier to tolerate
diversified feedstock. This flexibility with different biomass raw
material is a crucial advantage with FB gasifiers [160]. In addition,
around 10 g Nm¡3 is the commonly observed tar level, which is
generated from secondary and tertiary tars [29].

PTasaka et al. [161], used a BFB gasifier which regulated the ER to
ensure a bed temperature between 700 to 900 °C. Pyrolysis and gasi-
fication of biomass feedstock took place in the hot bed, forming char,
tar and gaseous species. Tar was cracked to a significant extent and,
as a result, only around 1 to 3 g Nm¡3 of tar was present in the exit
syngas. The tar yield was around 12 wt. % of the cellulose in the fed
biomass (in steam gasification) without employing any catalyst.

PCFB gasifiers are able to gasify large quantities of biomass and can
be operated at high pressures. One application is for them to gasify
bark and other forestry wastes in paper mills. This type of gasifier
consists of a reaction vessel and a cyclone separator and the bed
material is circulated between them. Ash is removed in the latter
and char and bed material granules are returned to the former. Gases
produced are sent to the gas turbine (GT) for power generation. Cor-
ella et al. [162] and Osowski et al. [163] discussed the major issues
related to this kind of gasifier. They stated that the tar formation in
the outlet gas is higher than for the fixed bed while the particulate
fraction is similar. Secondly, installation and operational expenses
are much higher than for FXB gasifiers. A comparative schematic of
BFB and CFB is depicted in Fig. 8.

PThe DFB gasifier was first developed in Austria for biomass
steam gasification [164]. It separates the gasification and combus-
tion parts of the process by employing two separate fluidised beds.
The biomass is fed into the base of the gasifier bed, usually fluidised
by steam. The second bed acts as a char combustor using air in a
fast fluidised bed which heats the bed material to around 850 to
900 °C. The bed material acts as the heat transfer medium between
beds. This avoids gas transfer, allowing a N2-free syngas; it is sepa-
rated from the combustion flue gases in a cyclone and recirculated
to the gasifier via loop seal [165]. This technology is successfully
demonstrated at commercial scale in coal-fired power plants
[166,167].

PRecently, a new technology called an external circulating concur-
rent moving bed gasifier is under investigation, where combustion
of produced char and steam gasification of biomass feedstock take
place at the same time. It consists of a moving bed with the regions
where combustion and gasification take place. There is a loop
between these zones, where bed material is circulated, along with
heat transfer. Char combustion occurs in the combustion zone and
serves two purposes: (a) provides energy for endothermic steam
reforming reactions in gasification zone (b) regenerates catalyst by
burning off the char deposited over the catalyst. Wei et al. [168]
demonstrated hydrogen and tar yields of 53.3 mol. %, 0.7 g Nm¡3,
respectively, with S/B of 0.4 and temperature of 800 °C, employing
calcined olivine catalyst in a lab-scale facility. These results demon-
strate the potential of this technology for the production of low-tar
H2-rich gas.

POne of the critical benefits of FB gasifiers is the possibility to
employ a low-cost bed material which can simultaneously act as
a catalyst for gasification reactions and tar cracking. This material
should have high selectivity for product gas and should not be
prone to attrition and formation of carbon [7]. On the other hand,
the phenomenon of defluidisation reduces the ability of these
reactors to operate above 800 °C. Feedstocks, especially herba-
ceous biomasses, often contains considerable fractions of Si, K
and Ca which can form viscous mixtures that adhere to the sur-
face of the bed particles and bind them to form agglomerates,
preventing fluidisation [169,170]. This is the prime limitation of
FB gasifiers, although many solutions have been suggested for
this problem. One feasible solution is regulating the bed tempera-
ture to avoid melting of silicates and alumino-silicates present in
bed particles [27].

PIt should be noted that the installation and operational costs,
robust design and the requirement or otherwise of feedstock
pre-treatment are significant factors when choosing a gasifier.
Physical and chemical properties of biomass raw material,
desired product gas composition and calorific content and other
operating variables are other key parameters [171]. A reported
discussion about fixed and fluidised bed gasifiers based on mate-
rial,
technology, energy and environment demonstrates that
there are specific applications for these two gasification systems
[172]. Major gasifier designs along with their main advantages
and limitations are shown in Table 5.

3.2. Gasification thermodynamics and kinetics

PBiomass gasification is a complex process of many overlapping
steps. In addition, the physical and chemical characteristics of bio-
mass feedstock are highly variable in nature, which in turn influence
syngas calorific content and composition. Here, thermodynamic

Pmodelling can be an efficient tool to evaluate the impact of opera-
tional variables such as feedstock composition, temperature, pres-
sure and steam-to-biomass ratio on the overall gasification process
and on the product gas quality.

PEmploying a thermodynamic modelling approach, theoretical
boundaries of various chemical species can be evaluated, at equilib-
rium. Furthermore, optimum operating parameters and available
work contained in biomass fuel can also be determined by develop-
ing an equilibrium model [173]. In principle, thermodynamic predic-
tions are independent of reactor type, reaction time and reaction
network [174]. However, in practical situations, thermodynamic
results are only appropriate for gasification with longer reaction
times on account of the key role played by kinetics in these condi-
tions [175].

PIn real life scenarios, chemical interactions inside the gasifier take
place for a finite time and, therefore, predictions by equilibrium
models have mixed success depending on reaction temperature and
residence time. The equilibrium models work fairly well in high-
temperature entrained flow gasifiers but much less well in fluidized
bed systems for instance [176]. This necessitates the development of
kinetic models which account for reaction rates, gasifier hydrody-
namics and residence time of particles. For specific operational con-
ditions and gasifier design, kinetic models can forecast product gas
composition, temperature inside the gasifier and gasifier perfor-
mance to a greater degree of accuracy.

P3.2.1. Thermodynamic modelling approaches

PThermodynamic modelling can be done by employing a stoichio-
metric or non-stoichiometric method. The former necessitates the
selection of only the dominant reactions, whereas the latter employs
the feed elemental composition (C, O, H, S, N) of biomass feedstock
obtained from ultimate analysis. Models developed by the stoichio-
metric method can result in significant deviations from real life
scenarios if important reactions are neglected. On the other hand,
the non-stoichiometric approach is more suitable for processes such
as biomass gasification where precise chemical composition is
unknown or is highly variable and whose reaction mechanisms are
often uncertain.

PNumerous books, book chapters and large volumes of research
and review articles have been published hitherto on thermodynamic
models to predict syngas quality and quantity [174,175,177(cid:1)182].
These models provide acceptable estimates of syngas composition
and alterations in chemical species vis-(cid:1)a-vis operational variables.
However, in a large number of cases, experimentally observed values
deviate from the predicted values on account of the following inap-
propriate assumptions: (i) tar and char are considered as solid car-
bon; (ii) ash is considered as an inert species; and (iii) inadequate

Pequilibrium assumptions are provided for some important reactions
[32]. It should be noted that during actual gasification, many reac-
tions do not attain chemical equilibrium and the aforementioned
deviations are influenced by different interactions of char and tar. In
addition, syngas quality can be affected by the catalytic activity of
ash during pyrolysis.

P3.2.2. Equilibrium model developed by CREC

PIn order to counter the above-mentioned limitations, Salaices
and co-authors [32] at the Chemical Reactor Engineering Centre
(CREC), University of Western Ontario, Canada, have developed a
non-stoichiometric model based on the elemental composition of
biomass feedstock. They investigated the impact of biomass com-
position and other operating parameters on product gas genera-
tion, employing a Gibbs free energy minimization approach.
CO, H2, CO2, CH4, H2O, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10, C5H12, C6H14 and
char were considered as the product species. Tar was not taken
into account because of its low concentration. Moreover, concen-
trations of N2 and S were negligible vis-(cid:1)a-vis equilibrium calcula-
tions and, therefore, were neglected [179,183]. Nine independent
non-linear equations were constructed taking 12 different varia-
bles. Calculations were also verified applying the ASPEN HYSYS
software package.

PSalaices and co-workers [32] studied the effect of varying bio-
mass composition on product gas constituents. They varied C:H (in
wt. %) and also C:O content over a diverse range of biomass feed-
stock, at 800 °C and 1 atm. For example, C:H was varied from 1:2.11
for jute stick to 1:0.69 for coal, whereas C:O changed from 1:1 for
glucose to 1:0.111 for heterotrophic (organic carbon). For various
biomass compositions, H2 yield was reported to be dependent upon
S/B. It was found that H2 yield in the product gas is enhanced with
an increase in S/B from 0 to 2 and is proportional to C:H fraction.
Moreover, a significant rise in H2 concentration in the product gas
was found, when S/B was increased above 1 g/g. All these results
were in the agreement with the experimental data.

PThese investigators also reported that CH4 reforming reactions,
interactions with higher HCs and water gas shift reactions do not
attain equilibrium at short reaction times of 5 to 30 s. Therefore, it
was concluded that thermodynamic models can predict the product
gas compositions, for longer reaction times (greater than 30 s). How-
ever, experimental studies demonstrated a significant deviation in
the trends of individual species present in the product gas from the
equilibrium modelling predictions when reaction time is shorter
than 10 s. This necessitates the need of a non-equilibrium model
to completely understand the interconversion of chemical species
during gasification of biomass.

P3.2.3. Thermodynamic models for biomass gasification

PNumerous researchers have developed thermodynamic models
for moving bed gasifiers, FB gasifiers and specially-designed gasifiers
as summarised in Table 6. Many studies were performed to evaluate
the system performance for integrated and hybrid biomass gasifica-
tion systems as well. As noted above, biomass gasification consists of
numerous stages, one of which is pyrolysis. As pyrolysis influences
syngas yield and quality, its accurate description can lead to more
precise forecasts by the equilibrium model [184].

PGao and co-authors [203] investigated the impact of heat rate
and temperature during pyrolysis on product gas composition. They
modelled the reduction zone and pyrolysis zone simultaneously in a
fixed bed gasifier. With rising temperature, H2 and CO yields were
enhanced whereas N2 and CO2 were reduced for constant heating
rate of the pyrolysis zone. Fractions of CH4 and H2O increased during
reaction and dropped at the end. When the temperature of pyrolysis
was kept constant, H2, CH4, CO and H2O concentrations increased
while CO2 and N2 concentrations decreased. This study demon-
strated the importance of pyrolysis temperature and heating rate on
end gas quantity and quality.

PThe law of conservation of atomic species, law of conservation of
energy and principles of chemical equilibrium were employed by
Melgar and co-workers [189] to evaluate optimal reaction tempera-
ture and syngas composition in a fixed bed downdraft gasifier. The
effects of feedstock moisture and fuel-to-air ratio were investigated
for a wide range of feedstocks. The modelling predictions were in
close agreement with the experimental results.

PNumerous important chemical interactions including biomass
feedstock, gasifying agent, evolved gases, etc., take place in the
reduction zone of the reactor. Therefore, detailed and precise models

Pcan lead to a better understanding of the gasification process. A few
studies were also conducted to model the reduction zone of down-
draft gasifiers. Sharma et al. [190] developed an equilibrium model
considering char-gas and gas-gas reactions which occur in the
reduction zone, to forecast residual char yield, temperature and dis-
tribution of gas species. The model was able to represent the real
conditions closely and, therefore, demonstrated that the predictive
ability of an equilibrium model can be enhanced by considering
initial reduction zone temperature and char bed length.

PPredictions regarding tar generated during biomass gasification
are a difficult issue on account of varying tar composition and yield.
Typical tar species were taken by Barman and co-workers [186] as
input variables to develop a model for a moving bed gasifier. It was
demonstrated that predictions of gasification products were close
to real values provided that tar yield was considered in the mass
balance equation. However, some deviation from equilibrium was
observed on account of CH4 reactions.

PCombined theoretical and experimental investigations were car-
ried out by Balu and co-authors [177] to evaluate the performance of
woody biomass feedstock in steam allothermal gasification employ-
ing a bench-scale steam reactor. High-quality, high-calorific product
gas (9(cid:1)10 MJ/m3) was produced with high-temperature steam
(1000 °C) as the gasifying medium. Trends of syngas composition
were found to be a function of unconverted char. For high-tempera-
ture steam gasification, H2 concentrations were between 50 to 60%.
The lower calorific value of the exit gas was reported to be 85%
higher than that for air-blown gasification. The results were in close
accordance with the experimental findings. It can be clearly shown
from the investigations that for high-temperature steam gasification
(»1000 °C), the S/B ratio should be between 1.3 and 10, as lower

Pthan 1.3 produces residual char while more than 10 generates no
usable fuel gas in the product gas composition.

PEquilibrium models do not work very precisely with FB reactors
on account of their inability to predict some kinetic and hydrody-
namic phenomena such as generation of unconverted char and gas-
eous hydrocarbon species and poor lateral mixing [196]. This issue is
countered by modifying the models using correlations and empirical
variables, to match the measured data from gasifiers. FB reactors
show complicated hydrodynamic behaviour on account of non-lin-
ear interactions between the fluid and the particles, and are, there-
fore, modelled employing a stoichiometric 1-D or 3-D approach or
by linking a Gibbs free energy minimization approach to a 2-phase
fluidisation hydrodynamic model [191(cid:1)197].

PA quasi-equilibrium formulation was employed by Lim et al.
[180] to create an air-steam BG model for FB reactors, to analyse gas-
ification process performance with ER, temperature and S/B ratio as
studied variables. Three empirical equations were generated and
two non-equilibrium factors were incorporated to adjust the devia-
tion with respect to experimental data. These equations enable flexi-
bility of the model to adjust to specified experimental conditions.
Syngas yield was evaluated by employing a carbon conversion frac-
tion. This model precisely calculated the distribution of product
gases, calorific content of syngas and thermal efficiency for varied
feedstocks and different reactors. The model was valid in the tem-
perature range of 700 to 830 °C, ER between 0.2 and 0.6, and S/B
ratio of 0 to 1.5. It should be noted that this model can provide a gen-
eral guideline about the operation of air-steam blown fluidised bed
gasifiers. However, it could not a priori forecast the syngas composi-
tion to a very precise extent on account of the inclusion of empirical
factors such as carbon conversion fraction and non-equilibrium fac-
tors. Therefore, adjustment in empirical parameters was required to
increase the accuracy of model prediction.

PThermal losses should be carefully considered, as the autother-
mal zone in a reactor is a function of gasifier design. Various model-
ling studies have been performed to calculate an optimum ER for
biomass gasification in FB reactors. It was reported that ER utilised
varies from 0.1 to 0.3 in fluidised beds [193(cid:1)195].

PInfluence of moisture content in the feedstocks on the gasifica-
tion process have also been studied by a few researchers. Kaushal
et al. [191] and Gungor et al. [195] performed investigations in FB
reactors and demonstrated that high-moisture-content feedstock
decreases average gasifier temperature and results in slower kinet-
ics, which in turn generates low quality syngas. Moisture content
can also be decreased by pretreatment of the feedstock via drying.
However, this increases the overall cost of syngas generation.

PA few thermodynamic models were also developed for specifi-
cally-designed reactors. Baggio and co-authors [200] performed
modelling and experimental investigations on an indirectly heated
batch reactor coupled with an external furnace. Unconverted char,
CO, H2 and CO2 concentrations at 800 °C found during experiments
were in close agreement with the predicted values. However, the
value for CH4 yield deviated considerably. They concluded that equi-
librium models are accurate only in the cases where thermodynamic
equilibrium is attained through longer residence times.

PBhattacharya et al. [199] designed a mathematical model to
investigate H2 yield, impact of ER and amount of H2O required in a
shift reactor for complete conversion of CO, and O2 fraction in gasify-
ing media. They employed an O2-blown biomass gasifier coupled
with a water gas shift reactor. It was found that the H2 purification
process is easier when a higher O2 fraction in the gasifying agent is
used, on account of lower N2 concentration. However, the percent-
age of O2 employed has negligible effect on the H2 yield. It should be
noted that the higher the purity of O2, the higher will be the H2 pro-
duction cost.

PRecently, a detailed validated equilibrium model was generated
by the researchers [182] of Delft University of Technology, The

PNetherlands, to evaluate the plant performance, future plant opera-
tions and scale-up possibilities of the 253 MW Willem-Alexander
Centrale Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant
situated at Buggenum. Experimental model validation was per-
formed on high percentage (»70%) biomass co-gasification employ-
ing steam-exploded wood pellets and torrefied wood pellets. A net
power output of 173 MW and net plant efficiency of about 37% were
predicted using steam-exploded wood pellets. However, the former
increased to 240 MW and latter to about 42% with 70% co-gasifica-
tion using torrefied wood pellets. It was found in the exergy calcula-
tions that maximum thermal losses occurred in the reactor and
during combustion. Model predictions vis-(cid:1)a-vis plant performance
and operating variables were reasonably accurate. This kind of real
scenario-based model formulation is highly useful in the future
development of carbon-neutral plants and also to plan real plant
operation with various biofuels. Furthermore, they also help in car-
rying out investigations to integrate carbon capture technologies.

PIt is clearly seen that thermodynamic modelling has proved to
be an efficient engineering tool to evaluate theoretical limits of
end product distribution. Furthermore, the influence of numerous
operating parameters can be evaluated on syngas composition and
calorific content for different gasifier designs. It is seen that equilib-
rium models are not very effective in predicting the gasification
process in FB gasifiers. However, this limitation can be overcome
by adjusting the models according to empirical correlations based
on experimental data.

P3.2.4. Kinetic studies

PAs mentioned earlier, many reactions taking place inside the
reactor proceed at a limited rate (i.e., they occur in a finite volume in
a flowing medium) and to a finite extent which necessitates the
kinetic studies of the gasification process [50]. A number of experi-
mental and modelling investigations have been carried out with dif-
ferent types of gasifiers employing diverse feedstocks, with an
objective to evaluate and find an efficient and cost effective gasifica-
tion system for given operating conditions.

PGao and co-authors [204] have carried out rice husk gasification
employing CO2 as gasifying agent via thermogravimetric experi-
ments to find the intrinsic kinetic parameters for the process. In
addition, they evaluated the conversion profiles for CO2-rice husk
gasification based on intrinsic parameters found in a random pore
model. They assessed the influence of gasifier temperature and CO2
partial pressure on gasification. The activation energy and reaction
order were found to be in the range of » 226 (cid:1) 232 kJ mol¡1 and
0.28 (cid:1) 0.35, respectively, whereas the pre-exponential factor was in
the range of 2.38 £ 105 (cid:1) 2.82 £ 105 s¡1 for the temperature range
of 700 (cid:1) 900 °C. The values of overall rate constants varied from 3.5
to 6 for the same temperature range and were found to be unaf-
fected by CO2 partial pressure and gasification temperature. They
reported an enhancement in rate constant from 7.36 to 7.64 when
gasification temperature was raised from 850 °C to 950 °C. On the
other hand, the rate constant increased in the range of 1.48 (cid:1)
1.63 times when CO2 concentration was raised from 25(cid:1)100%. As all
the correlation coefficients between the model and experiments
were more than 0.9, they concluded that the random pore model
was precise enough to assess intrinsic reactivities of rice-husk chars.
PA few researchers [205] have performed biomass gasification in a
conical spouted bed reactor in the presence of steam, to evaluate the
impact of temperature, partial pressure of steam and feedstock parti-
cle size, on the gasification kinetics. The choice of the reactor was
made to ensure high heat and mass transfer rates coupled with iso-
thermal conditions in bed. The temperature was varied from 800 (cid:1)
900 °C whereas steam partial pressure was varied from 0.2 to 1. Pine
saw dust was employed as the feedstock with diverse particle size dis-
tribution (0.3(cid:1)1, 1(cid:1)2 and 2(cid:1)4 mm). They concluded that temperature
is the most important parameter as a slight increase in temperature

Pfrom 800 to 900 °C drops the char conversion time to one-sixth. Parti-
cle size below 2 mm and gasifying agent partial pressure were not
found to have any considerable effects on the rates of reactions. A
homogeneous model, shrinking core model, nth order model and ran-
dom pore model were assessed for the fitting of experimental results.
The latter two models were found to be most precise.

PSreejith et al. [206] investigated the effect of calcium oxide for in-
situ CO2 capture during fluidized bed gasification, by developing a
kinetic model. The researchers employed wood as the biomass feed-
stock and a combination of air and steam as the gasifying media.
They reported an increase in the LHV of syngas from 5.58 to
6.12 MJ Nm¡3 (ER = 0.25, S/B = 1) when sorbent-to-biomass ratio was
enhanced to 1.5 from 0.75. In addition, H2 yield was enhanced by
16% when CaO was introduced in the gasifier. At 727 °C with S/B of
1.5, ER of 0.25 and sorbent-to-biomass ratio of 0.27, a maximum H2
fraction of 53% was obtained in the product gas. They also concluded
that air-steam gasification is more energy efficient than gasification
with steam alone. It can be clearly deduced that the application of a
cheap sorbent such as CaO is advantageous in biomass gasification
to yield a H2 rich syngas.

PA significant quantity of tar is generated in the gasification of bio-
mass and is considered as a major factor for downstream blockage
and reduction in efficiency. Researchers have performed experimen-
tal [207(cid:1)209] and modelling [210(cid:1)212] studies to understand the
tar production and removal mechanisms. Kinetic models have been
developed comprising numerous reactions and attempted more spe-
cifically to include gas phase reactions vis-(cid:1)a-vis aromatic growth
[213]. Norinaga and co-authors [214] generated a kinetic model
employing 500 species and 8000 reactions for the gas phase reac-
tions during secondary pyrolysis of cellulose. Elementary reactions
were combined and simulated, followed by comparison with experi-
mental data. Forecasts about inorganic gases, acetylene and acetic
acid along with predictions of minor products were quite accurate.
However, predictions about propylene and propane (at 700 °C) and

Pregarding methanol and C3 HCs were not so good. Possible reaction
routes leading to benzene were also predicted, thus reducing the
yield of feedstock to syngas and, therefore, to fuels.

PModelling of tar is a useful tool to understand tar formation and
destruction inside a biomass gasifier. However, detailed kinetic
modelling involves numerous species and reactions and, therefore,
the model development becomes too complex; this is a key area for
future investigation.

4. Syngas processing

PSynthesis gas or syngas is the key product of biomass gasifica-
tion and contains carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and
methane with traces of some other elements. Since its first usage
in the early nineteenth century by London Gas, Light and Coke
Company, it has become a significant fuel [215]. It serves as a raw
material for biofuels and chemicals synthesis and for power gen-
eration [215]. Globally, the largest proportion of syngas produced
is utilized in ammonia synthesis (50%) followed by bio-hydrogen
production (25%), with the rest used in bio-methanol generation,
FT synthesis and other processes [216]. Several syngas transforma-
tion routes and applications are depicted in Fig. 9.

PAccording to Woolcock and co-authors [218],

impurities in
biomass feedstocks and partial gasification lead to contaminants
in syngas, which are mainly classified as tars, PM, alkali, nitrogen
(NH3, HCN), sulphur (H2S, COS), halides and trace elements.
These contaminants are responsible for the previously mentioned
downstream problems in the gasifier such as corrosion, clogging
and catalyst deactivation. They also render syngas unsuitable for
bio-methanol production, FT synthesis, fuel cells and other appli-
cations. Syngas cleaning requirements are a function of end
applications and are shown in Table 7. They necessitate syngas
processing prior to its usage, via cold gas or hot gas processing
techniques.

PIt is not possible to prescribe the precise syngas clean-up strategy
in each case. The way in which the clean-up strategy should be
devised requires the integration of three different factors:

P(i) The nature of the biomass to be processed and the likely nature
of minor constituents and the tars formed depending on the
type of gasification technology employed (cid:1) this gives an indica-
tion of the window of possible syngas compositions that the
clean-up technology will have to deal with.

P(ii) The nature of the downstream processing of the syngas (cid:1) is
the process aiming to produce, e.g., hydrogen, methanol or FT
liquids? The purity requirements for the catalytic conversions
and separations will differ in terms of tars and minor constitu-
ents.

(iii) Integrating (i) and (ii), the performance in terms of removal
percentage of different clean-up technologies and their
sequencing (e.g., early removal or cracking of tars followed
by syngas polishing) can be optimised to meet the down-
stream requirements while respecting the expected impurity
profile window.

PSyngas cleaning technologies are classified as hot gas clean-up or
cold gas clean-up based on the condensation temperatures of vari-
ous species present in the syngas. Usually, cold gas cleaning uses
water sprays where contaminants are absorbed in water droplets
and condense with water at the exit where temperature is low
(<»100 °C). Hot gas cleaning techniques take place at elevated tem-
peratures (> 300 °C), where many alkalis condense. Other hot gas
technologies occur at very high temperatures of 1000 °C or above.
Significant contaminants and relevant cleaning technologies are dis-
cussed in the subsequent sections and are also summarised in
Table 8.

4.1. Tars

PTars are condensable organics ranging from heterocyclic aro-
matics to multi-ring (1 to 7) PAH species [74,219]. They are con-
sidered to be the key challenge in the gasification process on
account of their ability to clog downstream equipment, deactivate
catalysts and degrade syngas quality [220]. Practically, it is impos-
sible to completely avoid tar generation during gasification,
although it can be reduced to a considerable extent by employing
suitable technologies.

PIn practice, tar is cracked by employing any of three strategies:
elevated temperatures, catalysts or non-thermal plasma. All of the
strategies enhance the tar degradation rate and try to enhance the
rate at which chemical equilibrium is attained, thereby reducing the
quantity of tar (a non-equilibrated species) leaving the reactor. They
may be employed in-situ or post-gasification, depending upon the
end application of syngas and gasifier design. They can crack tar to
as low as 50 mg m¡3, if applied in-situ, which is a reasonable limit
for certain uses such as direct burning [221,222]. Downstream treat-
ment can decompose tar to the limits of detection and is, therefore,
employed for high-purity uses of product gas such as fuel cells or
biofuels synthesis.

PThermal decomposition of tar usually employs a temperature
between 1100 °C and 1300 °C, where lower temperatures require
high residence time and vice versa [223,224]. Fjellerup et al. [225]
and Houben et al. [226] observed that at 1075 °C naphthalene in tar
is degraded to about 80% in 5 s whereas the same results are
obtained in just 1 s when the temperature is raised to 1150 °C.
Brandt and co-authors [227] have demonstrated that effective tar
cracking requires only 0.5 s at 1250 °C. The initial tar amount is also
a deciding factor for the reduction of tar employing this strategy
[222,227]. Downstream thermal decomposition of tar enhances the
soot and particulate fractions in the product gas [226,228,229].

PHouben et al. [228] have reported the formation of soot and heavy
PAH in an FB reactor using thermal cracking downstream of the gas-
ifier. However, an optimal methane-to-hydrogen ratio (low CH4 and
high H2) in the product gas can be determined to crack tar instead of
soot formation. At lower ERs and higher H2, the tar yield decreases
to a significant extent on account of naphthalene cracking; this is
converted into lighter tars and permanent gases. Furthermore, tar
can also be removed as soot but this decreases the calorific value
and purity of the syngas. Thermal decomposition is relatively simple
and effective, but expensive on account of high energy demands.

PDecomposition of tar using catalysts requires relatively low tem-
peratures but at the cost of operating problems owing to catalyst
deactivation through sintering, coking and/or poisoning [230]. Sut-
ton and co-workers [123] suggested tar cracking potential, ability to
regulate carbon monoxide and hydrogen fractions in syngas, meth-
ane reforming potential, resistance to coking and sintering, high
mechanical strength and cost-effectiveness as some of the desirable
characteristics of a catalyst employed in hot gas cleaning. Ni-based
catalysts are most commonly employed in commercial applications
although they suffer from coking and sintering. Recently, researchers
are becoming more interested in transition metal-based catalysts on
account of their better potential for tar cracking and enhanced resis-
tance to carbon formation [220,231]. Detailed discussion on catalysts
and catalytic cracking is provided in Section 3.1.5.

PPlasmas are highly reactive in nature with a potential to decom-
pose tar compounds [232]. A very high temperature can produce
thermal plasma whereas non-thermal plasma is generated by mole-
cule-electron collisions at high energy. Pulsed corona, direct current
(DC) corona and radio frequency (RF) plasma are a few examples of
typically used non-thermal plasma for tar cracking. Pulsed corona
plasma degrades tar at a very low temperature of about 400 °C
[233,234]. Despite their effectiveness, these techniques are not used
in large-scale operations because of the operating intricacies and
high energy requirements [233(cid:1)235].

PWet scrubbing is the cold gas cleaning technique employed to
remove tar species from product gas. A large fraction of tar com-
pounds is directly absorbed in water. The remaining tar vapours are
converted to fine aerosols when syngas temperature falls signifi-
cantly while scrubbing and are easily absorbed in water. Class II and
III tars such as phenols, cresols, toluene, etc., are absorbed by water
droplets in the vapour form. This is efficient and cost-effective tech-
nology; however, it necessitates waste water treatment of a stream
containing toxic tar compounds, which is challenging. Waste water
treatment via biological or chemical pathways is the key issue with
this strategy and a relatively new area of research called ‘syngas fer-
mentation’ has provided a platform for relevant investigations [236].

4.2. Particulate matter (PM)

PResidual solid carbon and inorganic species form particulates
during gasification, which range in size from 1 to 100 mm. The inor-
ganic fraction of these contaminants is comprised of potassium,
sodium, calcium, silica, iron and traces of arsenic, selenium, lead
and zinc [237(cid:1)239]. The composition and size of PM are the func-
tions of type of gasification technology employed and biomass raw
material [240]. Corrosion, erosion and fouling can result from the
presence of PM in syngas. Even direct burning of syngas necessi-
tates the particulate fraction to be lower than 50 mg m¡3. Numer-
ous researchers have studied its effect on erosion of turbine blades
in IGCC power plants and pressurized FB combustion power facili-
ties [235,241,242].

PInvestigations in the past three decades have developed promis-
ing advancements in hot gas cleaning technologies for PM [173].
Inertial separations using cyclones, barrier filtration employing
granular filters and electrostatic precipitation are typically used
techniques at hot gas temperatures. Cyclones are devices which

Premove heavier solids from lighter gases by employing the principle
of separation by inertia. They decrease the time required by light
particles to settle by gravity, by using centripetal acceleration. They
are available in numerous designs. Choice of a specific design is
dependent upon the nature of the PM and gas [240,243-245]. They
are highly efficient with particle size PM10 (particle diameter less
than or equal to 10 mm) and above. Removal of smaller particulates
is also possible (PM0.5 with an efficiency of 90%) with the incorpo-
ration of multiple stages for large gas volume, though this is expen-
sive and complex [240]. A relatively new design known as a ‘reverse
flow gas cyclone’ has an efficiency of 99.6% in pilot and commercial-
scale plants for 1 mm particles [246]. These are promising technolo-
gies on account of high efficiencies and robust nature. However,
design advancements are needed to reduce process complexity and
cost for particulates removal of less than PM10.

PBarrier filtration is another commonly used hot gas clean-up
strategy for PM. It employs the principles of diffusion, impaction by
inertia and gravity settlement [235]. Filter media which are made up
of fibres or granules of different materials such as fabric, ceramic,
metal, alumina, etc., collect PM. The fabric filter is one of the oldest
devices which can decrease the particulates (» > 1 mm) quantity to
less than 1 mg m¡3, although its operational temperature is limited
to about 250 °C on account of its construction material [235,247].

PThe kind of cleaning strategy employed and the maximum allow-
able drop in pressure prior to the removal of filter cake is the most
crucial design factor for a system employing a fabric filter [218].
Compressed gas pulses, rapping, mechanical shaking and reverse
flow are commonly employed cleaning techniques. Optimal filtra-
tion velocity which is defined as flow rate per area of fabric, is the
other important design parameter. It reflects total effective fabric
area of the filter. Lastly, material of the cleaning medium is the key
design consideration. The temperature and composition of the gas
are the deciding factors for the material employed. Synthetic poly-
mers (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, etc.) with low crystallinity can func-
(< 250 °C) whereas metallic
tion only at
composites (Nextel's 3 M material) can work efficiently at elevated
temperatures as high as 700 °C [235]. High temperatures and pres-
ence of alkali particulates and acidic gases such as HCl and H2S
enhance the probability of corrosion in fabric filters. The minimum
inlet temperature is kept above the acid dew point of the gas to
avoid acid/moisture condensation, which in turn prevents corro-
sion [248]. In addition, common materials such as poly-peptide,
silicate glass, etc., are corrosion-resistant and cost effective vis-
(cid:1)a-vis composites.

low temperatures

PProgress in rigid filter design has enabled them to function at
high temperatures of 400 °C with a removal efficiency of 99.99% for
a particle size of 100 mm and above [249]. Advancements in design
and granular media materials for moving bed granular filters, in
recent years, have enhanced removal efficiency and operational
temperature ranges. Smid et al. [250,251] showed removal efficien-
cies of 99% and 93%, respectively, for 4 mm and 0.3 mm particulates
at 840 °C. The same authors have demonstrated an efficiency of
99.99% up to 870 °C employing a stand-leg moving granular bed fil-
ter system. These filters are highly promising on account of high-
temperature operation with efficient operation and minimal mainte-
nance. The major limitations with filter devices are the low lifetime
of the filter due to elevated temperatures and frequent downtime
because of stress and shock. Although many strategies have attained
a removal efficiency of 99% at 400 °C or above, non-stop operation
before failure hardly goes beyond 2700 h [249]. New materials for
filters and better designs are needed to improve filter life and reduce
downtime frequency.

PElectrostatic precipitators exploit electrical properties of the gas
stream (gas þ particulates) to remove particles. Particulates are
charged under the influence of an electric field and separated from
the gas stream on account of differences in dielectric properties

P[252]. Tube type and parallel plate are commonly used designs.
Device design, electrical resistivity of the gas stream, voltage
applied, and particulate geometry are some of the parameters which
define device performance. Electrical resistivity of the particulate
phase has a profound influence on the working of ESP. Charge dissi-
pation effects prevent the effective removal of the solid particle with
very high or very low resistivity, when it comes in contact with the
collector element. Particulates such as carbon black have low resis-
tivity (< 100 V m) which make them lose charge rapidly when they
reach the collection electrode [235]. Consequently, they acquire the
same charge as the electrode and are repelled back to the stream.
Particulates (e.g., elemental sulphur) with high resistivity of greater
than 10 GV m suffer from the undesirable phenomenon of ‘back
corona’ on account of slow discharge at the electrode leading to
excessive accumulation of charge [252]. In addition, collection elec-
trodes are unable to trap solid particles with a very high resistivity
of more than 100 GV m due to their extremely slow migration
velocity (»2 cm s¡1) [252].
It has been found that significant
improvements in ESP efficiency can be achieved by decreasing the
resistivity of the particles by employing temperatures above 150 °C.
For example, an increase in industrial ESP ƞ from 81% to 98%
was reported, when the dust resistivity was reduced from 5 GV m
to 0.1 GV m [218]. It should be noted that particle resistivity
should not be reduced beyond a threshold to prevent particle re-
entrainment via high rate of charge dissipation.

PESPs are typically employed at 200 °C for fly ash removal in ther-
mal power plants, and between 300 and 450 °C in synthetic fuel
plants for oil vapour separation [235,253,254]. Their efficiency
decreases with an increase in temperature, although few research
investigations have employed temperatures as high as 1000 °C
[235]. These systems are efficient; however, elevated temperature
and pressure result in decreased mechanical strength and induction
of stress, respectively, in materials.

PWet scrubbing using water as the scrubbing agent is a commonly
used cold gas cleaning technique. Spray scrubbers, wet dynamic
scrubbers and electrostatic scrubbers are a few examples of wet
scrubbers employed for particulates removal [255]. Inertial separa-
tion is the implied principle behind all the methods used to separate
particles of size 3 mm and above [218]. However, with smaller par-
ticulates removal, temperature gradient, liquid-vapour pressure and
electrostatic forces also play significant roles. Spray scrubbers have
high efficiencies of about 90% for PM5 particles which reduces to 40%
for submicron particles [255]. Wet dynamic scrubbers have a higher
efficiency of 95% for 5 mm particle size and 60 to 75% for submicron
particles [218]. Wet electrostatic scrubbers are most promising on
account of their high efficiencies, low energy consumption and com-
paratively lower pressure drops. Bologa and co-authors [256] have
observed an efficiency of 99% in removing submicron aerosols of
ammonium sulphate, hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride in
lab- and pilot-scale investigations employing a two-field wet elec-
trostatic precipitator. These authors have reported a power drop of
0.2 kWh for every 1000 m3 of syngas in industrial tests with an effi-
ciency of 95% for sulphuric acid removal. Progress in the research
work is needed to reduce its complexity and waste water treatment
issues to make it the most promising option at commercial-scale
facilities.

4.3. Alkalis

PRaw biomass inherently contains alkali and alkaline earth metals
in variable quantities. Herbaceous biomass has larger amounts of
alkalis than woody biomass, whereas the latter contains larger frac-
tions of alkaline earth metals [27]. They can also be inadvertently
added to the syngas via some catalysts which are employed for other
contaminant removal [257(cid:1)259]. The presence of alkali metals
such as sodium and potassium in gasification-derived syngas is

Pconsidered a serious issue on account of their reactive and volatile
nature. They are responsible for ash fouling and corrosion in boilers
and gasification power plants [260, 261]. They can also cause cata-
lyst poisoning during and after gasification. Therefore, a decrease in
their concentration is required from a few g kg¡1 to a few mg kg¡1,
depending upon the application [262].

PCondensation, and adsorption by sorbents, are two normally used
hot gas clean-up strategies for alkali metals removal from syngas.
Alkali vapours nucleate and agglomerate when the gas temperature
drops below their condensation temperatures. In order to decrease
the vapour phase alkalis that pass through the equipment, the tem-
perature is kept below 600 °C [173,258]. Adsorption is a better
choice on account of its capacity to remove alkalis (in any phase) at
almost any temperature [218]. Tolerance for elevated temperature,
high and irreversible adsorptions, and regeneration capacity with
high loading potential are some basic required characteristics of a
sorbent [263]. The temperature range and presence of other contam-
inants in the syngas are the deciding factors for the sorbent life.
Silica, clay, activated alumina, etc., are typically employed hot gas
sorbents [235, 264,265]. Minerals such as kaolinite chemisorb alkalis
even at very high temperatures of around 1000 °C and may be
employed in-situ or post-gasifier [263]. Bauxite effectively removes
alkali metals via physisorption, in 0.2 s with an efficiency of 99%
[266]. It can be employed at elevated temperatures and can easily be
regenerated with boiling water. Activated alumina is another good
choice for hot gas removal of alkalis. At 840 °C, it outperformed kao-
linite, bauxite and second grade alumina with sodium loading of
6.2 mg g¡1 and efficiency of 98.2% [267]. These sorbents not only
eradicate alkali species but also get rid of chlorine from syngas.
Therefore, adsorption via sorbents is a cost-effective and efficient
method. However, trials with new sorbents are required which
can eliminate other contaminants as well, inside the gasifier and
downstream.

PAlkali vapours condense and agglomerate with other materials to
form small solid lumps or fuse with tars around 300 °C, during wet
scrubbing [268]. Wet scrubbers, therefore, remove alkalis along with
tar and other particulates. Biomass pretreatment (low-temperature
preventive technique) prior to gasification can also be done to
reduce alkali fractions in syngas. One of the strategies is to choose
low alkali-content biomass for syngas generation via gasification.
Almost 95% of the biomass feedstock contains alkalis either in water
soluble or ion exchangeable form, which can easily be washed or
mechanically dewatered [266,269]. Biomass raw material can also
be treated by acid to reduce alkali amounts. In one investigation,
high reductions in alkalis and other contaminants (sodium » 68%,
potassium » 90%, magnesium » 68%, phosphorus » 72%, chlorine
» 98%, sulphur » 55%) were observed with an overall ash decrease
by 45%, during gasification [270]. Another study on pyrolysis of
wheat straw and wood showed that acid treatment can reduce alkali
discharges by 70%, whereas water wash was only found to reduce it
by 30% [271]. Employing biomass pretreatment depends upon the
nature of feedstock, operational variables and desired cost of syngas.

4.4. Nitrogen

PDuring the pyrolysis phase of BG, nitrogen leaves the feedstock in
the form of ammonia or hydrogen cyanide [272]. The intrinsic char-
acteristics of the raw biomass along with operational parameters
decide the quantities of nitrogen generated. Normally, ammonia is
the dominant nitrogen species and is produced during primary reac-
tions (from biomass) or in the secondary gas phase reactions (from
HCN). With increasing temperature, fractions of ammonia and HCN
rise considerably during secondary reactions. Eventually HCN also
reacts with hydrogen to form ammonia [273-275]. However, almost
75% of ammonia produced during gasification is converted to ele-
mental nitrogen at operational temperature. Almost all applications

Pdemand its removal to a significant degree; e.g., GTs require ammo-
nia volume to be less than 0.05 mL L¡1, to prevent nitrogen oxides
release [275]. In addition, its reduction is also essential to avoid
catalyst poisoning.

PHot gas cleaning of nitrogen (present in the form of ammonia) in
syngas is carried out via selective oxidation or thermal degradation
in the presence of catalysts. If chemical equilibrium is obtained dur-
ing gasification, a very small amount of ammonia is present in the
syngas; however, it still renders syngas unusable in many applica-
tions, which necessitates clean-up [218]. Tar cracking catalysts such
as nickel-based,
iron-based, dolomite, etc., are also effective in
ammonia cracking. They are cost-effective and, therefore, suitable
substitutes to Ru, W, nitrides, oxynitrides and carbides [220,276].
Thermal cracking of ammonia typically takes place around 500 °C
but elevated temperatures (700(cid:1)800 °C) are recommended to pre-
vent coking [220]. Commonly employed nickel-based catalysts
decompose ammonia up to 75%, but they suffer from sulphur poi-
soning within about 60 h of operation; moreover, this issue would
be even more severe at increasing process pressures due to the for-
mation of NiS, although the higher the pressure the more efficient is
NH3 cracking [277].

PRemoval of ammonia via its absorption in water is one of the typ-
ical cold gas cleaning strategies used for nitrogen removal from syn-
gas. Pr€oll et al. [278] and Pinto et al. [279] found that nitrogen
compounds are removed to a significant extent, even when water in
the syngas condenses. In wet scrubbing of tar compounds, employ-
ing organic solvent (rape oil methyl ester) at 50 °C, syngas with
400 mL L¡1 of water vapour partially condensed. The initial concen-
tration of ammonia was 2 mL L¡1 [278]. An increase in efficiency to
50% was observed with a decrease in initial ammonia amounts. Fur-
thermore, addition of more water while wet scrubbing can enhance
removal efficiencies and bring down the ammonia level to pL L¡1;
however, it is also dependent upon biomass feedstock and upstream
treatment [280].

4.5. Sulphur

PSulphur is present as hydrogen sulphide, carbonyl sulphide and
carbon disulphide in syngas and sulphur dioxide (in combustion by-
products). The percentage of this contaminant is dependent upon
the composition of the biomass feedstock [281]. Usually biomass
contains low amounts of sulphur (0.1 to 0.5 g kg¡1) as compared to
coal (50 g kg¡1), except for a few feedstocks such as black liquor
(> 1 g kg¡1) and some types of grasses [220,276,282,283]. Even a
small quantity of sulphur is considered detrimental. It corrodes
metal surfaces and causes catalyst poisoning [284,285]. Moreover, it
forms oxides when syngas is combusted, which are regulated toxins.
PNumerous syngas applications require very low sulphur levels
(pL L¡1) to prevent catalyst poisoning and equipment failure. Even
direct combustion applications require negligible amounts of sul-
phur in the gas fuel to follow stringent emission norms for SOx. This
necessitates sulphur removal from syngas prior to its utilization in
biofuel synthesis and other applications [218]. Physical or chemical
adsorption via sorbents is the hot gas clean up technology most
widely used for sulphur removal. Metal oxides are the most promis-
ing sorbents on account of their high removal efficiency, high ther-
mal tolerance and regeneration potential. Westmoreland and co-
authors [286] have presented a comprehensive evaluation of poten-
tial metals vis-(cid:1)a-vis desulphurization potential and free energy min-
imization. Vamvuka et al. [287] have reduced their list to Fe, Zn, Mn,
Cu, Co, Mo, V as most effective oxides for sulphur removal.

PA blend of metal oxides was found have better characteristics for
desulphurization than individual metal oxides in terms of removal
efficiency, regeneration capacity, heat tolerance and other contami-
nant removal potential. For example, a blend of Mn, V and Cu
displayed high sulphur removal even at elevated temperatures of

P600 °C and above [220]. In addition, a mixture of CuO and ZnO had
very high removal efficiency of above 99%. ZnO is readily available
and is one of the most prevalent regenerable sorbents [288]. Conoco-
Phillips has developed a new sorbent called ZsorbIII which is a mix-
ture of ZnO (500 g kg¡1) and NiO (100 g kg¡1) for commercial
applications [289]. ZsorbIII eliminated an initial concentration of
10 mL/L of hydrogen sulphide with a removal efficiency of more
than 99%. During testing, optimal performance of the sorbent was
reported at temperatures between 400 °C and 600 °C and a pressure
of 2026.5 kPa, with syngas. Elevated pressures and temperatures
with repetitive regenerations caused no loss in activity or morphol-
ogy. Good performance of mixed oxides coupled with long lifetimes
makes them an attractive area for future research.

PLow-temperature sulphur removal techniques can be classified
as chemical absorption, physical absorption and a combination of
both processes. Where sulphur recovery is necessary, chemical
techniques are also employed. Chemical
redox and biological
absorption processes employ a solvent (primary, secondary or ter-
tiary amines) to generate bonding between hydrogen sulphide and
amine [218]. Acidic gases such as hydrogen sulphide are absorbed in
an absorber unit. The sorbent is recycled to the absorber division by
stripper division with the production of a strong acid gas stream.
However, sulphur in the form of carbonyl sulphide cannot be
removed from syngas employing this technique. Therefore, hydro-
genation of COS to H2S is needed. This increases the cost and com-
plexity of the entire sulphur removal process. Furthermore, liquid
solvents need to be replaced continuously during operation.

PPhysical absorption processes employ the simplest alcohol
(MeOH) or ethers such as DME. These solvents are excellent choices
on account of their capability to remove both H2S and COS at low
temperatures coupled with high loading capacity and minimum sol-
vent degradation. For example, the Rectisol process is generally used
for desulphurization of syngas, for ammonia and hydrogen synthe-
sis, employing methanol at -62 °C as solvent [290]. Acid gas scrub-
bing processes for desulphurization are very selective with high
efficiency. However, they are responsible for over 10% of the overall
cost of the plant because of multiple columns and absorbents [291].
PLiquid redox techniques for cold gas cleaning of sulphur are gen-
erally employed at commercial scale for acetic acid synthesis and FT
fuels production and have high capabilities to remove sulphur from
100 kg d¡1 to 36 t d¡1. In these strategies, varied feedstocks ranging
from coal to municipal solid waste were used under pressurized con-
ditions and almost 100% desulphurization was attained [292]. In
addition, improved catalyst activity, process flexibility, absence of
tail gas and regeneration of sulphur (via sulphate) were other
observed benefits. It should be noted that improper process manage-
ment may cause plugging problems which necessitate proper
administration.

PRecovery of sulphur during syngas cleaning is the key consid-
eration for all the removal techniques. Sulphur is usually recov-
ered as elemental sulphur or as sulphuric acid via previously
discussed physical and chemical processes. The acid is usually
employed as a reagent in catalytic processes such as petroleum
alkylation, methyl methacrylate synthesis, etc. or in leaching
processes such as mining or synthesis of hydrofluoric acid, phos-
phate, etc. [293]. Many industries dispose sulphur as a waste
after neutralizing sulphuric acid by its salt formation. Elemental
sulphur generated via the Claus process is either stored in the
form of blocks or sold to the market. These blocks are very large
and every block containing sulphur weighs more than a million
tons. Storing sulphur in blocks prevents its exposure to dust and
also avoids oxidation. This strategy is normally deployed in
remote regions. Many industries prefer to dispose of the acid gas
(H2S) underground directly than to stockpile the elemental sul-
phur. Generally, industries co-inject CO2 with H2S for geological
storage in order to save cost and avoid carbon emissions.

PSulphur recovered in the form of sulphate via liquid redox tech-
niques is hydrophilic with fast soil adsorption rates [292]. It is
often employed as an additive to regulate the pH of soil. Proper
management coupled with efficient technology can make this
noxious element useful and beneficial. Moreover, stringent laws
are required to restrict sulphur emissions and disposal, especially
in developing nations to prevent environmental hazards.

4.6. Halides

PChlorine, present as hydrochloric acid, is the prime halide con-
taminant in syngas. Chlorine in the form of alkali metal salt vapor-
ises at elevated temperature inside the gasifier and reacts with
water vapour to form hydrochloric acid [173,235,264,294]. Even
minute concentrations such as 0.024 mL L¡1 and 20 mL L¡1, are
responsible for corrosion in GTs and deactivation of nickel anodes in
solid oxide fuel cells, respectively [264,294,295]. Furthermore, HCl
can be converted to chlorides of ammonia and sodium after its reac-
tions in the gas phase. These species can cause clogging and fouling
in downstream piping and equipment.

PHCl is removed from syngas via adsorption by sorbents at ele-
vated temperatures [296]. A salt is produced because of chemi-
sorption when gaseous HCl is adsorbed on the solid surface of a
sorbent. A chemical equilibrium is attained around 500 - 550 °C
between gaseous and solid species involved in the process and,
therefore, this is the optimum temperature range for maximum
removal of HCl [297]. Alkali oxides, alumina and activated carbon
are widely used sorbents in fixed bed applications. Alkali-based
mixed oxides are also used on account of better efficiencies, but
are more expensive [264,298].

PAt commercial scale, cold gas cleaning is normally applied for
chlorine removal from syngas. Gaseous HCl and/or solid ammonium
chloride is removed via wet scrubbing of the gas through deposition
of ammonium chloride and absorption of HCl. This strategy not only
eliminates chlorine from the syngas, but tars, PM and alkalis are also
removed [218]. This technology is very efficient and commonly
employed; however, loss in process efficiency and equipment fail-
ures are observed on account of acidic compounds and filter cake
generation. Equipment damage due to corrosion may be avoided by
choosing suitable non-reactive materials such as glass, ceramic, tan-
talum, etc. [299]. Research is in progress to mitigate these concerns
associated with de-chlorination of syngas.

4.7. Other trace contaminants

PTrace elements such as mercury, arsenic, cadmium, zinc and sele-
nium are present in variable amounts in biomass feedstocks. Their
fractions are less than 0.1%. However, because they are highly toxic,
their emissions are heavily controlled. Mercury is highly corrosive
to aluminium and has been responsible for equipment failures in
natural gas applications. Due to health concerns, it is the most
highlighted toxin among all trace elements [290].

PAdsorption by sorbents is commercially employed technology
for the removal from gas streams of mercury and other afore-
mentioned contaminants. Kaolinite, bauxite, zeolite, lime, silica,
activated carbon and blends of other compounds are widely used
sorbents in IGCC and other combustion applications.
In some
investigations, metal oxides, limestone and fly ash have demon-
strated high removal efficiency for Se and As. Cd and Zn can also
be eliminated by using fly ash as a sorbent [300]. Activated car-
bon is used in natural gas applications for mercury removal.
Korens et al. [290] reported that a blend of silver and activated
carbon has a very high efficiency for
trace contaminants
removal; however, it cannot be regenerated and, therefore, is not
suitable for commercial-scale applications.

5. Alcohols

5.1. Bio-methanol (MeOH) and derivatives

PMeOH is one of the highly synthesised chemicals around the
globe. It is seen as a promising substitute for existing automotive
fuels. Prior to the introduction of gasoline as a cost-effective motor
fuel, MeOH was widely used for the same purpose. During World
War II, it was extensively employed to power automobiles in Ger-
many [43]. MeOH came back into the picture in the 1970 s during
the oil crisis on account of its easy availability and reasonable cost. It
can be employed directly as clean automotive fuel or can be mixed
with other conventional fuels. Furthermore, numerous important
chemicals (derivatives) can be produced using MeOH as an interme-
diate, such as formaldehyde, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE),
acetic acid, gasoline, DME, to name a few [217]. Various important
investigations vis-(cid:1)a-vis process design, engineering aspects and
recent projects for MeOH and synthesis of its derivatives are dis-
cussed in subsequent sections.

P5.1.1. Bio-methanol (MeOH)

PMeOH is a commodity chemical whose production initiated back
in the nineteenth century when wood alcohol was extracted during
wood pyrolysis [217]. The early twentieth century saw the develop-
ment of the MeOH production process, which is now employed com-
mercially, after numerous R&D efforts. MeOH can also be obtained as
the by-product in FT synthesis, provided alkali metal-promoted cat-
alysts are used. Natural gas reforming is the primary method of
MeOH synthesis. However, developments in BG have enabled the
usage of a variety of biomass feedstocks to produce syngas, which in
turn can be converted to MeOH. BG-derived syngas is fed to a metha-
nol reactor, where MeOH is synthesised along with H2O vapour in
the presence of a catalyst. Crude MeOH is a blend of numerous
chemical species such as water, alcohols, ketones, etc., and is
directed to a distillation unit for separation. Very high conversion
efficiency of greater than 99% is achieved, as unreacted syngas is
sent back to the reactor [217].

PRostrup and Nielsen [301] suggested that MeOH production
employing syngas takes place best at elevated temperature (350 °C)
and pressure (250(cid:1)350 bar), and is highly exothermic in nature as
depicted in Eqs. (5), (6) and (2).

A stoichiometric ratio (H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2/COþCO2) of around 2 is recom-
mended for MeOH synthesis; however, it is generally kept a little
above 2 to regulate by-products and also for kinetic reasons [302].
This reflects that there should be just the stoichiometric amount of
H2 required for MeOH synthesis. It should be noted that the presence
of CO2 enhances the rate by 100 times [303]. Moreover, isotopic
investigations have conclusively demonstrated that the carbon in
MeOH was provided by CO2 [303,304]. Carbon dioxide keeps the Cu
catalyst in an intermediate oxidation state Cu0/Cuþ preventing ZnO
reduction followed by brass formation. The proposed mechanism for
MeOH generation proceeds through a formate intermediate. CO2 is
adsorbed on a partially oxidized metal surface as a carbonate, and
hydrogenated. This intermediate is then hydrogenated in the rate-
limiting step. The sites of Cu have high activity for splitting the first
C(cid:1)(cid:1)O bond in CO2 that aid in maintaining the oxidation state of the
active copper sites [304]. However, catalyst activity is hampered
when CO2 is in larger amounts. Therefore, syngas composition is

Pregulated to contain 4 to 8% of CO2, for maximum activity and selec-
tivity of the process [305].

PCatalysts have the most significant role to play in MeOH synthe-
sis from syngas. ZnO/Cr2O3 were the earliest employed catalysts
while producing MeOH from coal gasification [217]. They have high
activity and selectivity along with high tolerance for sulphur poison-
ing. Copper (Cu) catalysts which are easily poisoned, became a better
choice as gas cleanup technologies advanced. A new era of low-
temperature (220-275 °C) and low-pressure (50(cid:1)100 bar) MeOH pro-
duction began in the late 1960 s, with the advent of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3.
After closure of the last high-temperature/pressure MeOH production
plant in the 1980 s, every commercial production plant now works at
low-temperature/pressure employing Cu catalysts [306]. Many other
catalysts formulations were used to increase per-pass MeOH produc-
tion [307]. For example, when Cu/ZnO is embedded with Cs, MeOH
yields are enhanced. However, this is applicable only for the heavier
alkali metals, as the addition of potassium diverts the products
towards the higher alcohol range [307]. For commercial MeOH syn-
thesis, catalysts usually have a lifetime of 3 to 5 years under normal
operating conditions, with a selectivity of more than 95%.

PLonger lifetime along with high selectivity of catalysts necessi-
tates stringent syngas cleaning. Catalyst poisoning and sintering are
considered as prominent reasons for catalyst deactivation in MeOH
synthesis [308]. Cu catalysts undergo reductions in surface area due
to sintering. Furthermore, sulphur present in syngas blocks the
active sites and reduces activity. It is, therefore, highly recom-
mended to keep sulphur below 1 ppm and preferably below
0.1 ppm. However, when ZnO is present in the catalyst formulation
with Cu, it keeps S away from Cu active sites by forming ZnS and
ZnSO4. Commercial Cu-ZnO catalysts have an activity of 70% by
absorbing up to 0.4% S [309]. The presence of chlorine in syngas is
also a major nuisance in MeOH synthesis on account of its ability to
form volatile copper chloride compounds and enhance sintering of
Cu [308]. In addition, it also increases S poisoning by forming Zn
chlorides and removing the previously available S capture sites. This
makes Cl more detrimental and hence, the limit for HCl is 1 ppb.
Metal carbonyls (especially Ni and Fe) are other syngas contami-
nants which affect catalyst performance [303]. They block active
sites and considerably reduce catalyst selectivity. Their concentra-
tions should be less than 5 ppb. Apart from gas contaminants, reac-
tor temperature is also an important parameter which influences
the catalyst. MeOH synthesis is a highly exothermic process which
necessitates continuous removal of the reaction heat. Elevated
temperature (> 300 °C) in the MeOH reactor causes sintering of
Cu crystallites [217]. Moreover, by-product (methane, DME, higher
alcohols, etc.) yields also increase at higher temperatures on account
of other competing reactions [310]. Therefore, proper regulation of
operating temperature is imperative for longer catalyst lifetime and
desired product yield.

PA major challenge for commercial MeOH generation is to over-
come thermodynamic limitations. Around 25% of syngas is con-
verted to MeOH in every pass, which is quite low [303]. This
conversion efficiency can be enhanced by lowering the operational
temperature, which shifts the equilibrium toward the products.
However, a decrease in temperature reduces catalyst activity. This
issue can be handled by removing MeOH as soon as it is produced,
after every pass. Methanol can either be physically removed via
physisorption or can be converted to some useful derivative such as
DME, acetic acid, etc.

PThe methanol reactor, commonly known as methanol converter
is designed based on the aforementioned considerations, namely,
regulating and removing high heat of reaction, and overcoming ther-
modynamic limitations to maximize per-pass conversion efficiency
[217]. Numerous designs were developed over the past decades and
are employed for commercial MeOH production. Basically, they are
of 2 types: (1) Isothermal MeOH converters (cid:1) They are designed to

Pbehave like a heat exchanger by constantly removing the heat of
reaction. They have an isothermal axial temperature profile. Some
commonly employed designs are Lurgi MeOH converter, Variobar
converter, MGC/MHI superconverter, etc. (2) Adiabatic MeOH con-
verters (cid:1) They are designed to contain numerous catalyst beds sepa-
rated by gas cooling devices. Either fresh (or recycled) syngas is fed
or direct heat exchange is employed in these reactors. The axial tem-
perature profile contains a saw tooth pattern which is low at the
point of heat removal and increases linearly in heat exchange
regions. The ICI low-pressure quench converter and CMD converter
are some of the commercially used designs. As mentioned earlier,
MeOH in itself is a source for many useful chemicals such as
DME, acetic acid and many others which are discussed briefly in
later sections.

P5.1.1.1. Recent projects for MeOH generation.
PChoren Industrietech-
nik, Germany, invented a novel concept for air-blown gasification of
biomass called ‘Carbo-V’ where the biomass raw material undergoes
slow pyrolysis as a pre-treatment step and releases gases and char
[311]. The gases undergo gasification at elevated temperatures of
about 1300 °C to yield syngas whereas the char goes through pulver-
ization and is fed downstream of the high-temperature reactor to
cool the syngas by endothermic char gasification reactions. This so-
called chemical quench decreases the temperature of syngas to
about 1000 °C. The concept has been tested in the 1 MWth alpha pilot
plant in Freiberg from April 2003 to May 2003 and generated
11,000 L of MeOH [312].

PBioMCN in the Netherlands has used an innovative process to
synthesise MeOH employing the gasification of crude glycerine
[313]. The crude glycerine from biodiesel plants is transported to the
BioMCN plant. It is stored in the tanks as feedstock for further proc-
essing. It is then purified, evaporated and cracked to obtain syngas,
which is further employed to generate MeOH. Produced MeOH is
purified via distillation. A BioMCN commercial plant is producing
200,000 t of MeOH every year. Prior to the installation of the large-
scale plant, the viability of the process was evaluated by a pilot plant
study in March 2008. The major advantage of this route is that the
feedstock is available in abundance as a by-product of a bio-diesel
production process. Therefore, using glycerine as raw material
reduces the problem of surplus glycerine disposal which in turn
makes bio-diesel synthesis more sustainable. BioMCN has also opti-
mized the logistics in the supply chain by using the same tankers
delivering the raw glycerine to deliver MeOH.

PThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) under the
Biofuels Systems Division of United States Department of Energy
ran a biomass-to-methanol generation pilot project [314]. Sugar-
cane waste, called bagasse, which is produced during the milling
of sugarcane, was employed as the biomass feedstock. The proj-
ect was focused on developing new catalysts to ensure cleaner
syngas generation during BG as well as to get the desired syngas
composition and to demonstrate the feasibility of a biomass-to-
methanol pilot plant. The primary objective of the study was to
produce cheaper MeOH from renewable resources such as bio-
mass to make it competitive with the conventional gasoline.
These type of projects aid researchers in industry and academia
to explore the possibility to enhance MeOH utilization as alterna-
tive fuel. Existing and planned MeOH generation plants are
illustrated in Table 9.

PThe signifi-

cance of thermodynamics in MeOH synthesis has already been dis-
cussed. Thermodynamic investigations are performed to evaluate
the optimum process conditions with an objective to increase the
overall process efficiency and per-pass conversion efficiency for bio-
mass gasification-coupled MeOH production plants and for poly-
generation of MeOH and heat and/or electricity.

PResearchers [327] modelled a 2-stage gasifier with an input of
5 MWth biomass, for the poly-generation of MeOH/DME, heat
and electricity, employing commercial software such as DNA and
ASPEN. Models of both recycling plants (RC plants) and once-
through plants (OT plants) were developed with an aim to com-
pare efficiency differences, when MeOH yield is maximized, as
shown in Fig. 10. In the RC plant model, around 76 to 79% of the
unused gas is recirculated back to the MeOH/DME converter,
whereas the residual 21 to 24% is employed for power genera-
tion. Energy efficiencies for biomass to MeOH/DME synthesis
were found to be 56(cid:1)58% and 51(cid:1)53%, respectively, for RC and
OT, taking LHV as reference. This efficiency is enhanced to 87 to
88% (LHV) if district heating is also counted as one of the prod-
ucts. This study proved that the MeOH production plant is more
appropriate and less complex in design for small-scale genera-
tion than a similar BIO-DME production plant.

PSues et al. [328] carried out a detailed modelling investigation
with five different bio-wastes, namely (a) wood and forest wastes,
(b) grass and organic fraction wastes, (c) agricultural wastes, (d)
manure and sludge and (e) MSW, to produce MeOH via biomass

PIn the two-stage production of DME, methanol is produced in the
first stage by catalytic conversion of syngas (Eq. 9). In the second
stage, the generated methanol
is dehydrated to produce DME
(Eq. 10)). This synergy among the reactions explains the higher total
conversion of syngas to DME (»95%) as compared to the conversion
of syngas to MeOH (»77%) [332]. In addition, considering reactions
in Eqs. (7) and (8), where 6 molcules of reactants give 2 molcules
of products, it is evident that higher reaction pressure has a direct
positive influence on syngas conversion to DME [333]. In the JFE sin-
gle-stage DME production process, the standard pressure employed
is around 50 bar with a range of 30 to 70 bar.

PMeOH production is thermodynamically limited and it has been
found that syngas conversion is greatly enhanced when dehydration
of MeOH (Eq. 10) occurs simultaneously [333]. Stoichiometric syngas
conversion to DME for reactions (Eq. (7) and (8)) under 50 bar, and
MeOH production [3] under 50 and 90 bar, are shown in Fig. 12. It
can be clearly seen that reaction (Eq. 7) has higher syngas conversion
efficiency for all temperatures. Fig. 13. shows synthesis gas conver-
sion with respect to CO/H2 molar ratio, for Eqs. (7), (8) and (9). For

Pgasification-generated syngas. A CFB gasifier was used with air and
oxygen as gasifying agents. Mass conversion yield for MeOH synthe-
sis varied from 15 to 38% for biomass (d) and (a), respectively. The
highest exergetic efficiency reported was 45% for biomass (c). This
efficiency (45%) dropped 1(cid:1)2% when exergy losses due to external
heat production were taken into account and dropped 5(cid:1)6% when
both heat and electricity production were accounted for. The highest
first law efficiency was found to be 53% for biomass (a) and (c) and
lowest of 43% for (d) (the sludge). It is again decreased by 2(cid:1)4% and
8(cid:1)9%, when external heat (only) and external heat and electricity
generation losses are considered, respectively. This study recom-
mended that overall process efficiency could be enhanced further
by better heat integration and regulation of operating variables
(temperature and pressure).

PPtasinski and co-authors [329] developed a model for sludge
gasification followed by MeOH synthesis via a modified plant to
compare its exergetic efficiency with the traditional sludge treat-
ment process. The plant under consideration had a capacity of
50,000 t dry solids a¡1 and LHV of the sludge was 12 MJ kg¡1
(ds). All plant segments such as thermal dryer, gasification reac-
tor, gas clean-up section, compressor, MeOH converter, distilla-
tion column and purge gas combustion were considered and
their irreversibilities were calculated. It was reported that MeOH
produced is a function of gasifier temperature and of dry solid
content of the sludge leaving the thermal dryer. Overall exergetic
efficiency was found to be higher than the conventional thermal
sludge treatment, and reached a maximum at 1000 °C with
80 wt. % dry solids content.

P5.1.2. Bio-dimethyl ether (DME)

PDME (CH3OCH3) is one of the most useful derivatives of MeOH
with diverse applications such as paints, agricultural chemicals, cos-
metics, etc. [330(cid:1)332]. It can also be employed as a diesel substitute
on account of its high cetane number. In addition, it can be used as a
cooking gas with slight modification in existing natural gas cooking
ovens.

PDME can be produced by two different approaches, namely 2-
stage synthesis (via MeOH) and direct synthesis employing syn-
gas as shown in Eqs. (7) and (8) [333]. In 2-stage production of
DME as depicted in Eq. (7), first MeOH is produced followed by
its dehydration in the presence of an acid catalyst (e.g., g-alu-
mina) in MeOH production conditions [334,335]. The reaction
shown in Eq. (7) is basically made up Eqs. (9), (10) and (2),
which are MeOH production, dehydration and water gas shift
reactions, respectively. In the absence of water gas shift, Eqs. (9)
and (10) can be combined to Eq. (8), which is another direct
DME synthesis route and adopted by a few companies including
Haldor Topsoe. JFE Corporation, Japan, adopted Eq. (7) to synthe-
sise DME in one stage for their 5 ton DME d¡1 (5TPD) pilot plant
[333]. Bifunctional catalysts are normally used for direct DME
synthesis in the gaseous or liquid phase (in slurry reactor). A

PEuropean Union's Seventh Framework Programme and the Swedish
Energy Agency [338]. This project involved a consortium of Chemrec,
Haldor Topsøe, Volvo, Preem, Total and Delphi. DME was synthesised
employing black liquor as the feedstock through the production of
clean synthesis gas and a final conditioning step. DME generated
was tested in a fleet of Volvo trucks to analyze the engine compati-
bility, commercial-scale possibility and technical standards.
In
September 2009, the world's first Bio-DME production plant at the
Smurfit Kappa paper mill in Pitea
, Sweden was brought on stream,
followed by the inauguration of a pilot plant in 2010 with a capacity
of about 3.6 t per day. This pilot plant employed forest residues as
biomass raw material and the estimated cost of the plant was
around USD 20 million.

P5.1.3. Formaldehyde

Fig. 13. Analysis of syngas conversion vs. H2/CO molar ratio for MeOH and DME syn-
thesis [333].

Peach reaction route, conversion reaches the highest level for a stoi-
chiometric H2/CO ratio. The stoichiometric H2/CO is 1 for Eqs. (7)
and 2 for Eqs. (8) and (9). Again, the maximum equilibrium conver-
sion of syngas to DME is considerably higher for Eq. (7) than for
Eq. (8) [333]. This observation reflects the importance of water gas
shift in DME synthesis.

PKansha and co-authors [336] carried out a modelling study for a
novel 2-step DME synthesis in order to evaluate its viability and its
potential to reduce energy penalties in the thermal and separation
processes, employing a commercial simulator (cid:1) PRO II-Invensys.
They employed the so-called ‘self-heat recovery’ approach in which
the entire process thermal energy (sensible þ latent) is re-circulated
among heating and cooling loads. They explore this technology only
for a single distillation column, but with excellent results. The
reboiler energy requirement was significantly reduced from 44.6 kW
to 1.4 kW, which reflects the great potential of this approach for
DME synthesis. In addition, this technology can be employed for any
biofuel production including MeOH.

PXiang et al. [337] performed an extensive first law and second
law investigations for a complete DME production system which
was comprised of a biomass torrefaction unit, entrained flow gas-
ifier, single-step DME synthesis and DME purification, coupled with
heat recovery and co-generation. The DME generation rate was
0.32 kg¡1 of biomass feedstock (raw sawdust). Energy and exergy
efficiencies were reported to be 55.2 and 46.9%, respectively. The
exergetic efficiency was improved to 52.6% when the torrefaction
unit worked at 250 °C and the gasifier was operated at 1200 °C. This
study provides some important information vis-(cid:1)a-vis thermody-
namic evaluation of the entire DME system and has the potential to
aid in future process design modifications and integration.

PDME generated via BG-derived syngas can be considered to be a
“green” fuel. Its calorific content is almost 1.4 times higher than
MeOH [333], albeit that studies have proved that it is mildly toxic
(like liquid petroleum gas), but less so than MeOH. However, it does
not have any corrosive influence on metals and is not an ozone-
depleting chemical either. It has a very high potential to be used as
cooking gas but can also be employed as a diesel substitute and/or
additive on account of its high cetane number. More research is
needed to improve engineering aspects of process design to enhance
per-pass conversion efficiency and reduce the overall process energy
penalty.

PThe BioDME project to evaluate the large-scale viability of DME
production from lignocellulosic biomass was backed by the

PFormaldehyde (CH2O), or methanal, is one of the most important
products from MeOH. It is a precursor to numerous chemical prod-
ucts, and finds its largest application in the production of industrial
resins. In the late nineteenth century, it was first produced commer-
cially at atmospheric pressure via partial oxidation of MeOH in the
presence of air and Cu catalyst, in Germany [339]. Later, silver and
iron/molybdenum/vanadium oxides replaced Cu as catalysts. It is
synthesised by dehydrogenating MeOH (Eq. (11)) and partial oxida-
tion (Eq. (12)) over Ag [340,341].

Most of the commercial processes use MeOH mixed with air (1:1)
passed through a thin fixed bed over Ag catalysts at slightly above
atmospheric pressure and temperature of 600 °C. Metallic Ag by
itself is not active for MeOH decomposition and, therefore, chemi-
sorbed O2 is needed to provide sites for MeOH adsorption. Other
commercial processes employ iron molybdate as catalyst, requiring
a lean blend of MeOH and air. It is more exothermic and hence con-
stant heat removal is a prerequisite to avoid volatisation of molybde-
num oxide which decreases process selectivity [339]. The partial
pressure of O2 should be high and MeOH concentration should be
low, to prevent catalyst deactivation.

P5.1.4. Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)

PMTBE ((CH3)3COCH3) is a volatile, flammable and colourless liq-
uid, mildly soluble in water, which raises the octane number of gaso-
line and, is used as a gasoline additive. Typically, more than 95% of
MTBE production ends up as a gasoline additive. It also finds applica-
tions in the petrochemical industries for isobutene synthesis and in
hydrocarbon industries as solvent [342]. At the commercial level,
MTBE production units consist of reaction and refining sections. It is
synthesised when isobutene reacts with MeOH over an acidic cata-
lyst, at a temperature range of 30 to 100 °C and pressure range of 7
to 14 bar, as shown in Eq. (13) [217].

The reaction takes place in liquid phase and is exothermic. The most
commonly employed catalysts are zeolites (H-ZSM-5), solid acids
and macroporous sulphonic acid ion exchange resins (Amberlyst-
15) [343]. Isobutene conversion is enhanced, and its dimerization
and oligomerization are prevented by increasing the amounts of
MeOH.

PThere is debate over the production and usage of MTBE around
the globe considering its potential as a human carcinogen, especially
in the Americas. Leakage from underground gasoline storage tanks
and spillage of MTBE-containing gasoline above ground contaminate
groundwater. It imparts an unpleasant taste to water and renders a

USA and provinces in Canada have closed the production units
for MTBE and many are planning to do so in the near future [217].
However, its potential as a human carcinogen is not yet proved.

P5.1.5. MeOH-to-olefins (MTO)

POlefins such as ethylene, propylene, butane, etc., serve as the
raw material for modern chemical manufacturers. They are also
employed to produce diverse chemicals (benzene, isopropyl ben-
zene, styrene, etc.), all of which are of high commercial importance
[344,345]. The most common route to produce olefins is via steam
cracking of diesel, naphtha and ethane [346]. Increasing pressure on
petroleum resources and climate change issues, however, have led
to a demand for alternative pathways for olefin production. The
methanol-to-olefins (MTO) approach can produce renewable olefins
via diversified biomass feedstocks. In the past few years, green
MeOH synthesis via BG-derived syngas has been developed as a
mature technology [347(cid:1)349]. Therefore, biomass-to-renewable
olefins production which includes biomass-to-syngas conversion
(via gasification), syngas-to-MeOH conversion and MeOH-to-green-
olefins conversion, appear to have opened a new route, with mini-
mal environmental effects.

PBio-methanol is converted to olefins by employing zeolite cata-
lysts. Keil et al. [348] suggest elevated temperatures, low pressures
and low catalyst activity (acidity) as the optimum conditions for
light olefins synthesis. The desired range of products can be pro-
duced by regulating the rate of production [303,350]. Norsk Hydro,
Norway, employs the MTO process at a commercial scale to synthe-
sise ethylene and propylene [348]. It uses FB reactors at elevated
temperature (400-450 °C) and obtains high carbon selectivity
(»80%) to olefins. In some cases, operational variables are regulated
to get preferred yields.

PThe most important energetic and exergetic evaluations of 2-
stage olefins synthesis, namely, biomass-to-MeOH synthesis and
MeOH-to-olefins synthesis are depicted in Fig. 14 [351]. A thermody-
namic model was developed using wheat straw as the biomass feed-
stock and entrained flow gasification as the method to generate
syngas. Around 0.25 kg of light olefins was produced per kg of feed-
stock, which was slightly higher than the previously reported value
in the literature, due to the production of high-quality syngas via
entrained flow gasification. Energetic efficiency was found to be
54.66% while exergetic efficiency was 47.65%, considering light ole-
fins as the sole product. However, major exergy losses were reported
in gasification, steam cycle, MeOH separation, CO2 extraction and
olefins separation. Biomass torrefaction and thermal energy integra-
tion were suggested as the ways to enhance available work.

P5.1.6. MeOH-to-gasoline (MTG)

PThe methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process was developed by
Mobil Oil Corporation, USA. It depends on the conversion of MeOH

Pto HCs in the presence of zeolites [348]. Crude MeOH with around
17% H2O is superheated at 27 bar and 300 °C and partially dehy-
drated in the presence of alumina catalyst. This results in about three
quarters of the total MeOH conversion and an equilibrium mixture of
MeOH, DME and H2O is produced. From this, HCs (44%) and H2O
(56%) are obtained, when the effluent is blended with high-tempera-
ture recycled synthesis gas and fed into a reactor in the presence of
ZSM-5 in the temperature range of 350-366 °C and pressure range of
19(cid:1)23 bar [352]. Multiple gasoline conversion reactors are arranged
in parallel in the MTG process to burn off the coke produced during
the process by regenerating zeolites [353]. The process chemistry is
depicted in Eqs. (10), (14) and (15).

The process has very high selectivity (»85%) for gasoline-range HCs
and the residual product is mainly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
[303]. Around 40% of HCs synthesised are aromatic with 43% xylenes
and 26% toluene. One of the major drawbacks of the MTG process
is high durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) concentrations in the
product [350]. It necessitates gasoline distillation to decrease the
durene amount to less than 2%. However, as a consequence of this
treatment, high octane gasoline is obtained. Nonetheless, MTG is not
a very good option to produce gasoline on account of stringent laws
vis-(cid:1)a-vis air toxicity, e.g., US Clean Air Amendment Act 1990 [354].

P5.1.7. Acetic acid

PAcetic acid is one of the most important chemicals produced from
MeOH. Bio-methanol carbonylation is responsible for around 50% of
acetic acid synthesis around the globe [355]. It is a precursor to syn-
thesise terephthalic acid, vinyl acetate and acetic anhydride, which
are further employed to manufacture latex emulsion resins, adhe-
sives, paper coatings, cellulosic plastics, cellulose acetate fibres, etc.
[217]. Acetic acid is synthesised by carbonylation of MeOH by CO in
the presence of catalysts (Rh, Co, Ni), promoted by iodine as depicted
in Eq. (16) [356]. This is in fact one of the most vital applications of
homogeneous catalysis at industrial scale. BASF's and Monsanto's
processes are two commonly employed liquid phase routes to syn-
thesise acetic acid.

Spath and co-authors [217] reported that the BASF process is a high-
pressure process (500(cid:1)700 bar) which employs a Co/I catalyst at
250 °C and with around 90% selectivity for acetic acid. On the other
hand,
the Monsanto process employs relatively low pressure
(30(cid:1)40 bar) at 180 °C in the presence of a Rh/I catalyst, to convert
MeOH into acetic acid with very high selectivity (> 99%). Due to less
severe operational variables and high selectivity, the Monsanto

Pprocess has displaced the BASF process since the 1970 s. However,
the chemical environment in this process is extremely corrosive and
necessitates the use of expensive steels as construction materials.
The high cost of Rh catalyst is another issue with this technology
[356,357].

5.2. Bio-ethanol (EtOH)

PEtOH is one of the oldest fuels derived from biomass. In the past
decade, bioethanol received significant attention as a potential alter-
native for gasoline or as an additive. Currently, it is a common prac-
tice to blend gasoline with EtOH, as transportation fuel, in many
countries including the USA. Investigations have proved that EtOH-
driven engines emit less greenhouse gases (GHG s) along with other
pollutants and its use is even more favourable when EtOH is syn-
thesised from cellulosic biomass and not from corn starch [358].
Numerous fuels, chemicals and polymers are also synthesised from
EtOH [359,360]. Moreover, this fuel has the potential for application
as a precursor to generate green H2 for fuel cells [361(cid:1)363]. How-
ever, the socio-environmental and economic concerns associated
with its use are still under examination [361].

PBio-ethanol is synthesised at the large scale via two commonly
employed routes. Biological treatment of feedstock involves extrac-
tion of sugars from food or energy crops such as sugarcane or corn,
followed by fermentation to obtain EtOH. The second method
employs hydration of ethylene which is obtained from petroleum,
over solid acid catalyst. Biochemical synthesis of EtOH is now con-
sidered to be a conventional process. Table 10 shows countries
worldwide which produce high levels of EtOH via the conventional
route of using energy crops as feedstock.

PBiological treatment is used to obtain beverage grade liquid
with 14% EtOH [364], whereas hydration of ethylene is employed
to synthesise industrial grade pure EtOH [365]. The major draw-
back with the hydration of ethylene route is its dependence
upon non-renewable oil. Highly volatile oil prices are another
issue with this approach. Fermentation is, therefore, normally
practiced to synthesise EtOH at commercial scale, but
is
unsuitable for fuel grade EtOH generation on account of its inef-
ficiency and high cost, due to energy-demanding distillation
stages [366]. In addition, microbes employed in fermentation are
incapable of converting complete lignocellulosic biomass (pen-
tose sugars) to alcohols [217,367]. Thus a constraint is imposed
on numerous easily available feedstocks for the process. Research
is ongoing to develop novel processes to convert pentose sugars
(and syngas as well) via fermentation, but no commercial plant
is in operation at present [217,368]. In light of the above issues,
thermochemical conversion of BG-derived syngas to bio-ethanol
in the presence of catalysts seems a desirable option and the
various routes to synthesise EtOH are depicted in Fig. 15.

PSynthesis gas obtained as the product of BG serves as the raw
material for catalytic conversion of EtOH synthesis via three dif-
ferent pathways [217,369]. It can either be directly converted or
used to generate MeOH which in turn can be converted to EtOH,
as shown in Fig. 16. Selective hydrogenation of carbon monoxide
present in syngas takes place at the catalyst surface, in order to
synthesise EtOH directly (Eq. (17)). The second method employs
MeOH as intermediate and involves reductive carbonylation in
the presence of catalyst. This process yields bio-ethanol by join-
ing C(cid:1)(cid:1)C bonds over the surface of the catalyst and is known as
MeOH homologation (Eq. (18)). The third approach is a 3-stage
process called the ENSOL process. Here, MeOH is first synthes-
ised using syngas as raw material. The second step involves ace-
tic acid generation via MeOH carbonylation, followed by EtOH
synthesis through hydrogenation of acetic acid (Eqs. (5), (19) and
(20)) [369]. All the reactions are represented in Eqs. (17), (18),
(5), (19) and (20).

According to Subramani and co-authors [364], MeOH homologation
via reductive carbonylation has lower EtOH yields and selectivity
vis-(cid:1)a-vis commercial levels. The ENSOL approach has three steps
and different catalysts are needed for each, making the process both
expensive and complex. These approaches have been tested in pilot-
scale plants but neither has been employed commercially. Both

Pthe same operational conditions in the presence of ZrO2/ZnO/MnO/
K2O/Pd and reported that the amount of EtOH produced in both
routes is 5 to 10 times higher for CSTRs than for FXBs. In addition,
MeOH productivity was found to decrease and EtOH was the major
alcohol grade produced in CSTRs, for both routes. Effective heat
removal and back-mixing were cited as the reasons for better per-
formance in CSTRs. Currently, SBCRs have also become an attrac-
tive choice for commercial establishments on account of numerous
reasons such as (1) enhancement in per-pass efficiency due to con-
stant heat removal, (2) elimination of intra-particle mass transfer
restrictions by employing smaller catalyst particles, (3) simple
reactor design and (4) addition or removal of catalysts without
breaking up the operation. Therefore, slurry reactors such as CSTRs
and SBCRs are promising options for EtOH synthesis; however,
appropriate solvents and their influence on catalytic activity are
major concerns and should be considered prior to their installation
and operation [364].

P5.2.1. Thermodynamics of bio-ethanol synthesis

PBio-ethanol synthesis via syngas in the presence of catalysts con-
sists of a complex reaction network which includes both the main
reactions and side reactions, resulting in a diverse product range.
The composition and yields of products are significantly influenced
by thermodynamic restrictions. Subramani et al. [364] performed
comprehensive equilibrium studies to evaluate the alterations
in enthalpy (DH) and Gibbs free energy (DG) between 25 °C and
400 °C, for EtOH production via direct synthesis and MeOH homolo-
gation routes. They investigated changes in DH and DG vis-(cid:1)a-vis
temperature by constructing Ellingham diagrams, as shown in
Figs. 17 and 18 and it can be seen from Fig. 18 that direct synthesis
of EtOH has the highest exothermicity (DH » 260(cid:1)270 kJ mol¡1).
Feeding MeOH along with synthesis gas (MeOH homologation route)
decreases DH (» 160(cid:1)170 kJ mol¡1). This further reduces to around
74 kJ mol¡1 when 2 mol of MeOH reacts to form EtOH, by what
appears to be a bimolecular reaction (Eq. (22)). This bimolecular
reaction is not firmly established; however, mechanistic investiga-
tions employing an isotopic tracer approach suggested the probabil-
ity of its occurrence during MeOH homologation [378,379].

PSubramani and Gangwal [364] predicted the trends of Gibbs
free energy change for syngas conversion to CH4, MeOH and EtOH
(Fig. 19) and concluded that direct synthesis of EtOH is feasible
below 280 °C, but that higher pressures are needed to enhance
favourable at all
amounts of EtOH. Methane formation is

Fig. 16. Typical routes to produce EtOH via syngas.

Pdirect synthesis and production of EtOH via methanol homologation
are accompanied by several side reactions. These side reactions are a
function of the catalysts used and they produce diversified chemical
species such as CH4, higher alkanes and olefins (C2(cid:1)(cid:1)C5), esters,
ketones, aldehydes, acetic acid, etc. Among all of these side reac-
tions, the highly exothermic methanation reaction is of prime inter-
est on account of its ability to consume H2 as shown in Eq. (21).

(cid:3)

Higher EtOH yields and selectivity demand the inhibition of the
methanation reaction. This can easily be achieved by controlling the
operating conditions and the type of catalyst used. Another important
side reaction is the water gas shift reaction [370]. This is promoted by
almost all the commonly employed catalysts for EtOH generation and
is favourable when the feed syngas contains low H2. Normally, a ratio
of 1 to 2 (H2/CO) is employed for direct EtOH synthesis.

PCrespo and co-authors [371] investigated the impact of MeOH
co-feeding in the catalytic reactor to convert BG-derived syngas
into EtOH, over MoS2 catalyst. Methanol was recycled and its influ-
ence on EtOH and HC production was evaluated at three different
reaction temperatures (280, 290, 300 °C). They reported a linear
rise in CO conversion and EtOH generation, and exponential
increase in HC production as a result of co-feeding MeOH with syn-
gas. Bio-ethanol and higher alcohols production was found to be
more than doubled, when the MeOH molar concentration was
enhanced from 0 to 8%. A trade-off needs to be established between
enhancement in alcohol generation and selective conversion to
EtOH. It should be noted that only lower MeOH concentrations
have positive impact on EtOH production.

PNumerous investigations have been carried out using various
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts to convert syngas into
EtOH via direct synthesis and MeOH homologation. Bio-ethanol and
C2 oxygenates are directly synthesised from syngas over Co, Ru or Rh
metal formulations [372(cid:1)375]. Some oxy-solvents (glymes, sulfo-
lane, etc.), ionic liquids (Bu4PBr) or iodides are employed as pro-
moters. Heterogeneous catalysts are broadly categorized as noble
metal-based and non-noble metal-based catalysts. The former are
Rh-based complexes whereas the latter include modified FT cata-
lysts, Mo-S2-based catalysts and MeOH synthesis catalysts [370].
Extensive studies on the catalysts employed for EtOH production via
catalytic syngas conversion can be found elsewhere [364,370,376].

PBio-ethanol production via gasification-generated syngas is a
highly exothermic process. Constant heat removal is imperative to
ensure optimum catalyst activity and a long catalyst lifetime. There-
fore, appropriate reactor design is a key parameter to obtain high
product yields with desired selectivity. FXB reactors are most com-
monly employed for almost all lab- and pilot-scale investigations on
account of their good performance and simple design. However, con-
tinuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) and slurry bubble column reac-
tors (SBCRs) have also been used in a few demonstrations. Verkerk
and co-authors [377] compared the data for EtOH production via
direct synthesis and MeOH carbonylation, for FXBs and CSTRs under

Pequilibrium reactor was operated at 240 (cid:1) 400 °C and 20 (cid:1) 80 bar
H2/(COþCO2) ratio was taken as 0.25 to 3 whereas CO2/CO was taken
between 0.2 and 1.5. They observed that low-temperature and high-
pressure conditions are favourable for EtOH synthesis. The composi-
tion of gasification-derived syngas is one of the deciding factors for
EtOH yields. Higher H2/(COþCO2) ratio and lower CO2/CO result
in higher amounts of EtOH. Therefore, syngas composition should
be regulated via feedstock composition and gas cleaning to obtain
maximum EtOH yields.

5.3. Mixed higher alcohols

PHigher alcohol synthesis from syngas has a long history of more
than 100 years. In 1913, BASF obtained a patent to produce a blend
of mixed alcohols and other organic compounds such as ketones and
aldehydes, from syngas [382]. They carried out the process at ele-
vated temperatures (300(cid:1)400 °C) and pressures (100(cid:1)200 bar) in
the presence of alkalized cobalt oxide catalyst. In 1923, Franz Fischer
and Hans Tropsch also developed a process known as ‘Synthol’ for
mixed alcohol synthesis from syngas, over Fe catalyst at around
450 °C and pressure more than 100 bar [217]. From 1935 onwards, a
few commercial processes synthesised mixed alcohols employing
alkalized ZnO/Cr2O3 catalysts, for about a decade [217]. Mixed alco-
hol production via syngas reduced to a considerable extent after
1945 on account of increasing demand for neat alcohols (as raw
material for chemicals) and easy availability of petroleum [383].
Interested readers can refer to the literature [384] for a comprehen-
sive discussion about earlier work in higher alcohol synthesis.

PInterest in mixed alcohols production and applications (such as
gasoline blending agents) was revived after the oil embargo in the
1970 s. Utilization of mixed alcohols as an additive to increase
octane rating is more promising than adding MeOH alone, in gaso-
line-driven engines [385]. As mentioned earlier, MeOH is also a com-
monly employed gasoline blending stock. However, it suffers from
high volatility and affinity towards phase separation, in the presence
of H2O [217]. In addition, it is not compatible with some engine-fuel
system parts. Mixed alcohols (MeOH þ higher alcohols) do not suffer
from these problems and also offer higher calorific content as com-
pared to MeOH alone. They are equally beneficial for diesel additive
as well. When employed as diesel blending agent (»20(cid:1)30 wt. %),
they offer better lubrication properties, improved ignition character-
istics and higher heating values than MeOH [386]. Although there
are some commercial systems to produce other fuels via syngas,
there is currently no large-scale plant which produces higher alco-
hols (C2(cid:1)C6). Poor selectivity and lower yields are the key factors
which make it commercially unviable [387].

PHigher alcohol production consists of various chemical reactions
with mainly three routes as depicted in Fig. 19. It results in the syn-
thesis of a wide range of products vis-(cid:1)a-vis equilibrium and kinetic
restrictions. Carbon monoxide from syngas reacts with MeOH to
form C(cid:1)(cid:1)C bonds, in the primary stage [217]. Linear chain alcohols
are synthesised in a step-wise manner which initiates with the pro-
duction of MeOH [388]. Subsequently, bio-ethanol, propanol, buta-
nol and other higher alcohols are synthesised, by the homologation
of MeOH. It should be noted that the catalyst employed for higher
alcohols production should also demonstrate MeOH synthesis activ-
ity as MeOH is a recurrent C1 reactant. Alkalized MoS2 is used for lin-
ear alcohols production whereas modified MeOH and FT catalysts
are employed for branched chain alcohols synthesis [217]. Wong
et al. [389] and Hutchings et al. [390] have provided the following
general reaction Eq. (23) for higher alcohol production:

Ptemperatures under consideration; however, MeOH synthesis from
syngas is only thermodynamically viable below 150 °C. It should also
be noted that while CH4 and MeOH are commercially produced from
syngas, C2 oxygenates (EtOH, acetaldehyde, acetic acid) are not
directly synthesised, although the reactions to produce them are
thermodynamically favourable. It can be inferred that C(cid:1)(cid:1)C bonding
for EtOH direct synthesis from syngas is thermodynamically possible
but kinetically limited.

PHeijden and Ptasinski [380] performed second law analysis for
EtOH production via steam-blown BG-generated syngas. This
included biomass feedstock (wood) drying and gasification, syngas
cleaning-conditioning-compression, EtOH production, separation
and heat recuperation. They developed the model using commercial
software (cid:1) ASPEN PLUS, employing Rh-Mn/SiO2 and MoS2-
K2CO3(cid:1)(cid:1)CoS catalysts. They reported that Rh-based catalyst showed
reduced CO conversion and higher EtOH selectivity than MoS2-based
catalyst. Taking EtOH as the only product, both catalysts showed
almost equal exergetic efficiency of around 44%. However, when
EtOH production by-products are taken into account, the efficiency
of the MoS2-based catalyst (65.8%) was higher than the other
(58.9%), on account of extra by-products generation. The maximum
irreversibilities occurred in the gasifier, EtOH reactor and syngas
compressor and it is evident that the overall process exergetic effi-
ciency would improve at lower gasification temperature on account
of minimization of irreversibilities. Moreover, catalyst performance
was also found to improve with decreasing gasifier temperature.
However, the gasifier cannot operate below a threshold temperature
(»800 °C) due to kinetic restrictions. This study proves that bio-
ethanol production via thermochemical gasification-produced
syngas is a promising pathway for green fuel synthesis.

PYan and co-workers [381] investigated the impact of process
variables such as temperature, pressure, H2/(COþCO2) molar ratio
(in syngas), on CO and CO2 conversion and EtOH yields. Their

Pwhere n normally varies between 1 and 8 [383]. It can be inferred
from the reaction stoichiometry that the molar H2/CO ratio is one-
half, although simultaneous water gas shift enhances this ratio to 1.
All the key reactions involved in higher alcohol production are
shown in Eqs. (5), (2), (24), (18), (25), (22), (10), (26) and (27)
[364,391].

Low temperature and elevated pressures inside the reactor are opti-
mum conditions for MeOH synthesis [392]. At higher pressures, with
the increase in temperature, the rate of higher alcohols synthesis
improves at the cost of MeOH formation and that of other HCs. This
rate can further be enhanced by keeping the H2/CO molar ratio in
syngas close to 1, which is favourable for CO induction and carbon-
carbon chain growth [217]. However, operating conditions for
higher alcohol production are more severe than for MeOH synthesis.
If the catalysts employed prove efficient for hydro-carbonylation
activity, then MeOH can be recycled for subsequent homologation
resulting in higher productivity [388,392]. Chemical dehydration
occurs in-situ for mixed compound (higher alcohols, ethers, esters)
synthesis on account of the water gas shift [392]. Yields are the func-
tion of shift activity of the catalysts used. Secondary reactions are
responsible for aldehydes, ketones and CH4 formation [392(cid:1)394].
Equilibrium restrictions limit the theoretical amount of higher alco-
hols produced [393]. It can be clearly seen that lower yields of higher
alcohols are produced per mole of CO consumed, more by-products
per mole of alcohols are produced and a higher amount of heat is
expelled, as compared to MeOH.

are

PBi-functional-based hydrogenation catalysts

typically
employed for higher alcohols synthesis and are classified into the
following four groups [382] (cid:1) (1) modified elevated-pressure MeOH
production catalysts (alkali-doped ZnO/Cr2O3), (2) modified low-
pressure MeOH production catalysts (alkali-doped Cu/ZnO and Cu/
ZnO/Al2O3), (3) modified FT catalysts (alkali-doped CuO/CoO/Al2O3)
and (4) alkali-doped sulphides (MoS2). It can be noted that alkali
metals are added in the formulations for all kinds of catalysts on
account of their basicity. They act as a site to catalyse the aldol con-
densation reaction by stimulating surface-adsorbed CO along with
an increase in formate fraction which is an intermediate [217]. Mod-
ified MeOH and FT catalysts are found to be more effective in mixed
alcohols synthesis with oxide-based catalysts performing better
than sulphide-based [395]. Catalysts formulations based on Rh are
also employed to synthesise C2 oxygenates such as acetaldehyde
and acetic acid along with enhanced levels of CH4 [391,396].

PHowever, they have been developed for selective EtOH production.
More research on new catalyst formulations is recommended to
enhance the activity and selectivity for higher alcohol synthesis pro-
cesses.

P5.3.1. Unique higher alcohol synthesis in single stage

PMatson and co-researchers [397] have demonstrated a novel pro-
cess to synthesise higher aliphatic alcohols (C2 to C6) and methylated
derivatives from wood and cellulose in the presence of supercritical
MeOH and Cu-doped porous metal oxide (PMO) as depicted in
Fig. 20. They converted biomass to liquid fuels in one step at a tem-
perature range of 300(cid:1)320 °C and pressure range of 160(cid:1)220 bar,
with little or no residual char. They employed a stainless steel Swa-
gelok mini-reactor to carry out the investigations and examined
woody sawdust, powdered torrefied wood and cellulose fibres and
observed the key components (gas and liquid phases) present in the
products, for each feedstock employed. Higher alcohols and ethers
(HAE) with 2 to 6 carbons, and substituted cyclohexyl alcohols and
ethers (CAE) with 9 to 12 carbon atoms, were obtained as liquid
yields. Gaseous phase chemical species were mainly comprised of
CO, H2, CO2, CH4 and other volatiles.

PThe authors further suggested that significant ring methylation of
the final products also occurred when lignin was treated by this pro-
cess [398,399]. It should be noted that comparable methylation of
unsaturated intermediates is a probable source of branched alcohols
in HAE products while treating cellulose. Metal oxide/Cu is very
effective for carbonyl hydrogenation [308], aryl ether hydrogenoly-
sis and aromatic ring hydrogenations [399] and it was reported that
the blend of supercritical MeOH and intrinsically-reduced Cu-doped
PMO is ideally suitable to aid the complex network of physical and
chemical processes needed to obtain liquid fuels via lignocellulosic
biomass.

PTransportation cost is a major obstacle in biomass conversion to
usable fuels [400]. The novel routes suggested by Matson and co-
authors [397] and depicted in Fig. 21 can eliminate the transporta-
tion cost from biomass source to processing facility. Medium-sized
facilities can be installed near the source (lignocellulose, crops, etc.)
to convert them to useful liquid fuels and there are three possible
pathways as shown in Fig. 21. The first option (MeOH option)
employs MeOH as reaction medium as well as liquid syngas to

Preduce biomass feedstock. The second option employs CH4-to-syn-
gas conversion to produce essential reducing species.

PAn existing CH4 distribution network can be helpful for this
route, however, accretion of an additional (CH4 reforming) process is
a limitation. The third option suggested by the researchers [397]
uses biomass to generate HAE and CAE, with even lower carbon
emissions [401]. In the last two pathways, MeOH can be produced
in-situ to be used as the reaction medium. This process seems prom-
ising, albeit thermodynamic and kinetic investigations should be
carried out to evaluate the feasibility of scale-up to commercial
scale.

P5.3.2. Pilot plant testing at NREL

PBiomass to mixed alcohols synthesis was carried out at National
Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA, for a continuous 233 h operation
in a pilot plant [402], on MeOH-derived syngas for 81 h and on a bio-
mass-derived syngas for remaining 152 h The average syngas com-
position comprised 39% H2, 33% CO2, 13% CO with some other gases.
The plant operated at maximum pressure and temperature of
138 bar and 322 °C, respectively, and generated 20 L of mixed higher
alcohols. The system consisted of a solid feeder, FB steam reactor,
thermal cracker, char collector, FB steam reformer, packed bed pol-
ishing steam reformer, scrubber, pressure-swing adsorption (PSA)
unit and gas phase continuously stirred tank gas to liquid reactor.
Tars and CH4 were reformed over a NREL-developed Ni-based cata-
lyst in a FB reactor, followed by pelletized precious metal catalyst in
a FXB reactor. Promising results were reported in steady state condi-
tions. Steam reformers converted almost 100% of tars, 97% of ben-
zene and 86% of CH4 present in the producer gas. More discussion on
this subject can be found elsewhere [402].

5.4. Comparison of MeOH, EtOH and gasoline as transportation fuel

PMethanol and ethanol both have high octane ratings and, there-
fore, have the potential to be employed as gasoline substitutes or
blending agents in SI engines. Some tests have shown the possibility
of using 85(cid:1)100 vol. % MeOH in automobiles. Prior to the introduc-
tion of cost-effective gasoline, MeOH was widely employed to propel
vehicles [403]. Interestingly, MeOH is a better fuel for SI engines
than conventional gasoline, with higher thermal efficiency and
lower emissions. High octane number (106) coupled with lower

Pflammability makes it a better choice [404]. However, 2.2 L of
MeOH is equivalent to 1 L of gasoline due to its lower energy density,
necessitating larger fuel tanks.

PEthanol has a long history as an automotive propellant. In 1894, it
was employed in France and Germany by the incipient IC engine
industry [405]. Wider flammability range coupled with higher heat
of vaporisation, higher flame speeds and higher octane rating (108)
than gasoline, imbues it with a shorter burn time and higher com-
pression ratio, which in turn results in better efficiency [406].
Table 11 depicts the physical and chemical properties of MeOH,
EtOH and gasoline and demonstrates that almost all the properties
of these two alcohols are close in value to those of petroleum-
derived gasoline, thus making them a promising choice as substi-
tute/blending agent for SI engines, although the heating value of gas-
oline is higher than these alcohols, necessitating larger tanks to
provide the same amount of energy.

6. Fischer Tropsch (FT) fuels

PFT synthesis for higher hydrocarbons production was developed
by German scientists Franz Fischer, Hans Tropsch and Helmut Pich-
ler in 1923 [408]. Diesel, gasoline and heavy oils were synthesised
via syngas in the presence of Co catalysts. The Ruhrchemie atmo-
spheric FXB reactor was the first established for industrial produc-
tion of FT fuels in 1935. It was used to produce gasoline, diesel,
lubrication oils and other chemicals with total production of 0.10 to
0.12 Mt a¡1, employing coke-derived syngas [409]. All commercial
FT plants around the globe use syngas produced by coal or natural
gas reforming, as summarised in Table 12.

PUnlike other biofuel production processes, FT is considered to be
the most developed and mature technology for liquid transportation
fuels synthesis. As mentioned earlier, all
large-scale FT plants
employ either gasification of coal or reforming of natural gas to gen-
erate syngas. Thus, BG-based FT plants should not encounter any
serious technical issues. Gasification of biomass feedstock to gener-
ate syngas followed by its conversion to long chain HCs and upgrad-
ing to liquid transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel over Co
or Fe catalysts is a promising option for the future of biofuels [413].
Although there are numerous commercial-scale BG plants world-
wide for thermal and electrical applications, FT fuels generation via
BG-derived syngas has not reached that scale as yet. However,

Pnumerous demonstration plants with BG coupled with FT plants
have been set up with the same motivation [411,413(cid:1)419] as
summed up in Table 13.

PA significant study was conducted by Kim and co-authors [412]
to produce FT liquid fuels via BG-derived syngas. This integrated
bench-scale system was run for 500 h on a 20 kWth gasifier and pro-
duced 0.1 bbl d¡1, as a pre-cursor to establish a pilot plant of 200
kWth with a production of 1 bbl d¡1. An atmospheric BFB reactor
was employed over a temperature range of 700(cid:1)900 °C, with wood
pellets as the feedstock. The gasifier, gas cleaning and processing
unit (cyclone, gravitational dust collector, packing type wet scrubber
and MeOH absorption tower), acid gas removal unit and FT reactor
formed the system. The FT reactor was operated at an elevated tem-
perature of around 300 °C over Fe catalyst. FT diesel was produced
at an average rate of 0.037 bbl d¡1 which is lower than expected.
Elevated temperature, impact of high H2/CO ratio, non-optimized
FT reactor conditions and uncondensed C5 (cid:1) C8 fractions of the

Pproducts were cited as the reasons for lower yields. However, stable
operational conditions for every individual component were
achieved and technical viability was demonstrated.

6.1. Process chemistry and products

P6.1.1. Process chemistry and mechanisms

PFischer Tropsch technology offers a significant pathway to utilize
synthesis gas and produce higher HCs which can be further hydro-
cracked to premium-quality gasoline and/or diesel. Renewable bio-
mass feedstock of diverse compositions can be used to generate
clean transportation fuel when BG is coupled with FT synthesis,
leading to a promising and feasible substitute for fossil-derived liq-
uid fuels. The FT process is basically a surface polymerization reac-
tion which employs Co or Fe catalysts at 200(cid:1)300 °C temperature
and 10(cid:1)60 bar pressure. CO and H2 present in syngas interact to
form a chain initiator by adsorption and dissociation at the catalyst

lowed by termination and product desorption. FT synthesis is

The stoichiometry of FT synthesis is a function of usage ratio (ratio of
consumption of H2 and CO) and this ratio fluctuates as a function of
the extent of other reactions. The WGS alters H2/CO ratio and thus
influences the usage ratio [426,427]. Fe catalysts are highly active
for WGS and, therefore, can play an important role in FT process
in particular for H2-deficient syngas [428]. Biomass-
chemistry,
derived syngas can have a ratio of H2: CO as low as 0.7:1 [429], in
comparison to that from steam reforming of methane of 3:1. Co cata-
lysts are not active for WGS [430(cid:1)433]. Taking biomass feedstock as
the raw material to produce syngas which is further converted to
green fuels via FT process, the overall reaction (Eq. (33)) can be
written as:

The composition and variety of products generated by FT synthesis
are dependent upon catalysts and process conditions. Therefore, the
steps employed during the process along with the mechanistic and
kinetic factors directly affect the product quality and yield [434].
This explains the higher FT product yields in comparison to yields
calculated by thermodynamic investigations [433]. It is important to
note that exothermicity of the reactions is an important feature in
FT synthesis. Reactions producing H2O and CO2 as products release
more heat as the heat of formation of these species is higher [28].
Dissipation of heat of reaction becomes a critical factor to ensure sta-
ble reaction conditions, synthesise higher HCs and avoid catalyst
deactivation.

PNumerous studies [410,426,435(cid:1)441] [422(cid:1)424,427,442] have
been conducted to examine the kinetics of the FT process. The
kinetic models for FT synthesis can be categorized as hydrocarbon
selectivity models and detailed Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-
Watson (LHHW) models [427,442]. FT reaction networks form the

Pbasis of selectivity models and can be sub-classified as the double-
alpha models or the olefin re-adsorption models. Re-adsorption
models are employed often on account of their ability to evaluate
selectivity for diverse product species (paraffin and olefin), whereas
the former can only calculate the total HC production (lumped paraf-
fin and olefin) [427]. In addition, re-adsorption models can forecast
the deviations from Anderson Schulz Flory (ASF) and the alterations
of olefin-to-paraffin ratio vis-(cid:1)a-vis carbon number. On the other
hand, LHHW kinetic models take into account the complete FT
mechanism such as adsorption of reactants, formation of monomer,
chain initiation, propagation and termination. It should be noted
that these models also incorporate the information such as 1-olefin
re-adsorption and/or chain length-dependent olefin desorption
which aid in understanding the deviation in product distribution
with respect to carbon number [423,427]. Commonly employed
mechanisms are alkyl, alkenyl, enol and carbon monoxide insertion
mechanism [408], as shown in Table 14.

P6.1.2. FT products

PThe FT process synthesises a diverse range of HCs and oxygenated
HCs. The product spectrum is directed by mechanics and kinetics of
the reactions as well as by the catalyst type and reaction conditions.
Methane generation is considered undesirable and its selectivity can
fluctuate from 1 to 100%. Selectivity of long chain waxes can diverge
from 0 to 79% whereas yields of the products with an intermediate
number of carbon atoms are limited. The number of carbon atoms in
the products is a function of various parameters such as operating
temperature and pressure, catalyst employed, type of promoter,
syngas composition and reactor type [443].

PDesired products via FT synthesis include C20þ linear HCs, C5þ
paraffins and medium weight olefins, which are further processed to
generate usable liquid transportation fuels. The ideal FT process
should have high selectivity towards these products. It should be
noted that selectivity during FT synthesis is steered by kinetics dur-
ing polymerization which controls the chain growth process during
the catalytic reaction [444]. FT product spectra obey ASF chain
length statistics as depicted in Eq. (34). The reaction mechanism dur-
ing the FT process is assumed to follow ASF, however, the nature of
the catalyst necessitates variations in the ASF model [437].

where, wi is the product weight fraction, i is HC chain length and a is

and 0.9, where HCs with maximum weight fractions are from C5 to
C10 [28]. For industrial processes, only a few carbon chains are
desired on account of the fact that they have diverse physical prop-
erties and hence, different usage and distribution to the consumers.

PMoreover, longer chain groups (diesel, soft wax, hard wax, etc.) can
be cracked to smaller C chains, if the desired products involve
it can be
shorter chains (petroleum fractions). Consequently,
deduced that FT process conditions which yield product distribu-
tions with longer C chains provide more flexibility to choose saleable
fractions. Thus an ASF product distribution model is, therefore, a
useful tool on account of its ability to forecast the weight percentage
distribution of diverse FT product groups.

PVan der Laan [439] has performed extensive studies on the prod-
uct distribution employing Co, Fe and Ru catalysts. It was reported
that FT products with C1 were highest in concentration. These con-
centrations reduced steadily with higher C numbers however, a local
maximum was observed around C3(cid:1)(cid:1)C4. Monomethyl-substituted
HCs were produced in minor amounts whereas dimethyl species
existed in lesser concentrations. Interestingly, no branched product
species were found to contain C4 atoms. Alcohol amounts were
observed to be maximum as C2 and decreased with increasing C
atoms. In the FT product distribution, a deviation in chain growth
was reported only for linear paraffins and not for olefins.

6.2. Catalysts and reactors

P6.2.1. FT catalysts

PMuch research has been done on catalysts for the FT process.
The ability to catalyse hydrogenation of CO to higher HCs is the
key requirement for FT catalysts. Fe, Co, Ni and Ru are four typi-
cally used transition metals as FT catalysts on account of their
high hydrogenation activities [445]. Ruthenium is the most effi-
cient FT catalyst but it is more costly than others [443]. Ni also
has a high hydrogenation activity, although it forms more CH4
than Fe or Co. In addition, Ni catalysts are liable to constant loss
of metal due to the production of volatile carbonyls. On the other
hand, Fe and Co are easily available and cost-effective and, there-
fore, form the primary choices for the FT process. However, Co is
preferred over Fe for commercial-scale production as FT fuel pro-
duction rates with Co are considerably higher than with Fe [446].
The desire for improved FT catalysts has led to research [447]
for example, Co/
into combinations of metals and supports,
Nb2O5,
(in the study cited,
increasing the activity of the catalyst by more than a factor of 2).
Similar work has shown the promoting effect of CeO2 on the Co/
ZrO2 system (in both of these cases the primary effect of the pro-
moter was to enhance the number of active sites, most likely by
improving dispersion of the metal). Other workers [448] have
shown that the precise nature of catalyst-promoter interactions

including promoters such as Pt

P(in this case, Fe2O3¡MnO2) can result in significantly different
product yields via modification of the physical
forms of the
materials at the nanoscale. Extensive discussion on FT catalysts
can be found in the literature [441,445,446,449(cid:1)452].
Impor-
tantly, work is currently ongoing to improve understanding of
the underlying mechanisms of reaction at a molecular scale
[453], with better understanding likely to lead to more efficient
and rational catalyst design.

PThe overall FT reaction rate is a function of the following two
parameters: (1) diffusion rates of reactants and products through
the porous catalyst particles; and (2) rate of FT reaction on the sur-
face of the catalyst. Diffusion rates are functions of porosity and pore
size of the catalysts, concentrations of species and the presence of
higher HC species within the catalysts particles. It should be noted
that intra-particle diffusion plays a vital role in the FT process espe-
cially when diameter of FT catalyst particles is greater than 0.5 mm.
Therefore, utmost care should be taken while choosing FT catalysts
for the FT process using fixed beds [452]. Sulphur is known to poison
FT catalysts, most likely by competitive adsorption onto reactive
surface sites.

P6.2.2. FT reactors

PImportant relationships with catalysts and catalytic reactors have
led to the development of numerous designs for heterogeneous gas-
solid catalytic vapour phase reactors for the FT process, which is a
multi-product reaction system [451]. Most commonly employed
reactors are the multi-tubular FXB reactor, slurry reactor, fixed flui-
dised reactor and CFB reactor [452], as shown in Fig. 22(a), (b), (c)
and (d).

PThe mode of operation for FT reactors can be classified into
high temperature (300(cid:1)350 °C) or low temperature (200(cid:1)240 °
C). High-molecular-mass linear waxes are produced in low-tem-
perature processes over Fe or Co catalysts. On the other hand,
low-molecular-weight olefins and gasoline are generated at high
temperature in the presence of Fe catalysts. FB reactors are bet-
ter as they are more isothermal in nature and can operate at
around 320(cid:1)350 °C, whereas tubular FXB and slurry phase reac-
tors operate at a temperature which is 100 °C lower [454]. A
detailed account of the basic designs of FT reactors is available
elsewhere [451,452,454(cid:1)459].

PNovel intensified reactors based on micro channel systems have
been studied [460]. The main advantage of such a system is that via
tight temperature control, both the selectivity towards desired prod-
ucts and the activity of the catalyst can be carefully optimized. A
comprehensive review [461] discusses the different array of reactors

Pwhich can be used. Another novel idea is the use of ionic liquids to
suspend FT catalysts [430], which has been shown to be potentially
interesting.

6.3. Thermodynamics of FT synthesis, including co-products

POptimizing the overall efficiency of the FT process is compatible
with co-production of fuels and electricity (to allow utilization of
any unreacted gas) [433]. Such strategies can also improve the eco-
nomic argument for a process, in particular when the output can be
tailored depending upon oil and electricity sale prices at any particu-
lar time.

PMaximum generation of FT fuels via BG-derived syngas requires
optimal usage and understanding of the thermodynamics governing
the process. Many researchers have examined the FT process
employing the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Ptasinski
[462] developed a model to analyse exergetic efficiency for the
conversion of syngas to FT green fuels. Syngas (H2/CO = 0.8 to 1.6)
was produced by the gasification of sawdust (9.3% carbon, 55% vol-
atile matter, 35% moisture and 0.7% ash) in the presence of air at
900 °C and atmospheric pressure. FT fuels were produced at 260 °C
over a Co catalyst along with electricity generation [462]. The sin-
gle-pass conversion efficiency was found to be 80%. Diesel and wax
were reported to be the final liquid products. Low calorific content
(3 MJ m¡3) gas was recovered as tail gas and was used to produce
electricity in a steam Rankine cycle. In the analysis, 51.7 t h¡1 of
feedstock was reported to produce 5.1 t h¡1 of diesel and wax, and
4 MW of net electricity. The overall exergetic efficiency was found
to be 36.4% with maximum losses taking place in the gasifier, and
power generation from the tail gas. It should be noted that this effi-
ciency could be enhanced to 46.2% if the operating temperature of
the gasifier were reduced to 700 °C, naphtha included among other
FT products and a combined cycle were employed for generating
electricity. However, in a real case scenario, 700 °C in the gasifier
would not yield sufficiently fast reaction kinetics. Another study
[463] has compared the environmental impact of producing biodie-
sel via FT synthesis, with a particular focus on clean-up of the syn-
gas and integration of the process with electricity production. It
was found that the higher the fraction of syngas going towards the
production of diesel (as opposed to electricity) the higher the NPV
(net present value). Maximising an environmental-friendliness
index indicated that for a given input flow of biomass, autothermal
reforming (adding a small amount of added oxygen to the process
to clean up tars, etc.) was superior to not having such a reformer,
or the addition of a basic steam reformer, at a gasifier temperature
of 1000 °C, FT reactor operating temperature of 200 °C and reactor
operating pressure of 60 bar

PA recent publication [328] showed the results of carrying out
both energy and exergy evaluations for FT fuels generation through
BG, using various feedstocks such as wood, grass, agricultural resi-
dues, manure, sludge and MSW to generate syngas via gasification in
the presence of air, followed by its conversion to green fuel in a FT
reactor. The system was composed of pre-treatment, gasification,
gas clean-up, WGS, FT reactor and final product upgrading. Mass
conversion yield was reported to be 15%, 10%, 12%, 6% and 9%,
respectively for wood, grass, agricultural wastes, manure and MSW.
Wood and agricultural wastes have the best conversions due to high
C and H fractions. First law investigations revealed maximal effi-
ciency for agricultural wastes (44%) and minimal for manure and
sludge (36%). Second law examinations exhibited the same trend,
with the highest exergetic efficiency of 42% for agricultural residues
and 34% for manure, owing to the obvious reasons of less energy
penalty (in drying prior to gasification) and high C content. When
only external heat production is considered with an efficiency of
60%, exergetic efficiency falls by 1(cid:1)2% whereas if heat and electricity
(generation efficiency = 45%) both are taken into account along with
liquid fuels synthesis, the exergy drops by 4(cid:1)5%. In common with
previous investigations, the gasifier is the key source of irreversibil-
ities followed by electricity generation and cleaning, as shown in
Fig. 23. However, overall efficiency of the plant can be enhanced to a
considerable extent by taking heat integration measures and modi-
fying operating variables.

PAn interesting perspective for the FT process was demonstrated
by Hildebrandt and co-authors [464] to make it more energy effi-
cient. They suggested a pathway to optimize the energy usage for a
gasification-coupled FT system, by producing CO2 and H2 (and not
CO and H2) and employing them for higher HCs generation. They
considered different steps which require large amounts of work and
heat inputs as they are the reasons for lowering of efficiencies
[465(cid:1)467]. The model was developed taking coal and water as the
input to produce higher alkanes, where each CH2 monomer needed
58 kJ mol¡1 of heat input. Moreover, around 41 kJ mol¡1 of work is
required by the reversible process. Therefore, it adds up to a mini-
mum 350 MW of work for a FT plant producing 80,000 bbl d¡1 as
depicted in Fig. 24. The first step is to gasify the coal and is highly
endothermic, whereas the second step of FT synthesis is a low-tem-
perature exothermic process. In the first step, the heat input trans-
fers work, Win, which is equal to or more than the Gibbs free energy
change. On the other hand, the second stage emits heat and carries
work, Wout, which should be equal to Gibbs free energy change of
the reaction to make it reversible. Net work obtained for the overall
process is the difference between Win and Wout and is equal to the
Gibbs free energy change of the whole process. These two steps of
the coal-to-liquid process can be assumed to be equivalent to a heat
engine.

Fig. 24. Schematic of novel perspective for FT fuels synthesis via coal gasification (can be applied to biomass gasification as well) [464].

PConventional gasification-coupled FT plants are not highly effi-
cient on account of significantly more work input into the gasifier
and more work output from the FT reactor, than that needed to oper-
ate reversibly. It can be made more efficient by decreasing both Win
and Wout. The gasifier should produce CO2 and H2 to achieve this
goal (as it is less endothermic). Moreover, employing CO2 and H2 for
FT fuels synthesis is less exothermic. Although FT synthesis cannot
be carried out directly with this feedstock gas composition, it can be
made viable by incorporating reverse WGS to produce CO2 and H2O
as shown in Eq. (35).
3C þ 6H2O $ 3CO2 þ 6H2 ! 2 (cid:1)CH2(cid:1)
ð35Þ
Water can be employed to transfer heat back to the gasifier. This
model requires at least 20% less work input to the gasification sys-
tem than the CO pathway. If the work is recuperated in the form of
heat from the FT reactors, net work required was reported to be 820
MW for an 80,000 bbl d¡1 plant facility. This is closer to the optimum
value (350 MW) than the traditional path (1000 MW). Furthermore,
the production of CO2 via this route is around 15% (0.5 MT) less per
year. It should be noted that this approach can easily be adapted to
natural gas-to-liquid systems, followed by biomass-to-liquid sys-
tems. Further research and development is recommended to eluci-
date the technical challenges related to its implementation in BG-
coupled FT synthesis.

7. Bio-methane

PSynthetic natural gas or SNG consists mainly of methane (CH4)
and is a promising renewable substitute for natural gas (NG). It is
normally called bio-methane to distinguish it from non-renewable
natural gas. It is a vital energy carrier for industrial applications and
can serve as a transportation fuel, without the environmental impli-
cations of hydraulic fracturing [468]. It has all the advantages of nat-
ural gas including a dense distribution, trade and supply network. A
few decades ago, fossil fuels were the major source of bio-methane.
Climate change issues due to GHG emissions and fossil fuel depletion
have led to many significant research investigations to generate
green SNG (or Bio-methane). This can either be generated biologi-
cally with the aid of micro-organisms at around 70 °C in stirred tank
or trickle bed reactors, or can be produced through BG followed by
methanation (CO or CO2 methanation) at around 250 °C [469(cid:1)472].
Thermochemical catalytic generation of bio-methane (at pilot and
commercial scale) via biomass (or coal) gasification-derived syngas
has been adopted by numerous organizations, as depicted in
Table 15.

PPaul Sabatier and Jean Baptiste Senderens were French chemists
who discovered CO and CO2 methanation reactions in 1902 [473].
The original application of CO methanation (CO to CH4) is the
removal of CO from syngas, e.g., in ammonia synthesis [474] and in
proton exchange membrane fuel cells [470]. CO methanation found
application in SNG generation, when researchers tried to find an
alternative for NG during the 1970 s oil crisis by utilising coal gasifi-
cation-derived syngas [475]. CO2 methanation (CO2 to CH4) came
into being in the 80 s with an aim to use some other gas; however, it

Pis primarily dependent upon CO methanation [476]. Interest in CO
and CO2 methanation was revived in the twenty-first century on
account of climate change mitigation, electricity storage and health
consciousness issues. Fig. 25 shows the advancements in methana-
tion concepts over the past five decades and Table 16 reflects carbon
oxides technologies adapted by commercial SNG/bio-methane
plants.

7.1. Process chemistry

PBiomass-derived syngas can be utilized to produce methane in
the presence of catalysts and is, therefore, called catalytic generation
of bio-methane. CO and H2 from biomass or coal gasification are
employed to synthesise CH4 with H2O and heat as by-products
in CO methanation whereas CO2 methanation uses CO2 and H2
[470,473,477] as depicted in Fig. 26. Moreover, CO2 methanation is
an attractive option to chemically store electricity, if electrolysis H2
is employed as an educt [469,478-480]. Carbon oxides conversion to
CH4 is shown in Eqs. (21) and (36).

PThe heats of reaction mentioned for Eqs. (21) and (36) are at STP.
Interestingly, here CO and CO2 methanation release around 2.3 and
1.8 kW of heat, respectively, for 1 m3 of CH4 generation [470]. Fur-
thermore, there is a considerable volume contraction in gaseous
phase reactants (50% for the former and 40% for latter). Fundamen-
tally, the addition of CO methanation and reverse WGS results in
CO2 methanation (Eq. (2)). CO2 conversion is dependent upon the CO
concentrations and is inhibited when CO volume reaches a certain
limit [481,482].

directly influence these methanation reactions. Elevated pressures
and low temperatures are considered favourable for CH4 production,

PA few researchers have also employed supercritical water gasifi-
cation technology to study bio-methane generation using different
biomass feedstocks. Waldner and Vogel [486] investigated bio-
methane production via hydrothermal gasification in a laboratory
batch-scale reactor using wood as feedstock in the presence of Raney
Ni catalyst. High feed concentrations of about 10(cid:1)30 wt. % were fed
at 300(cid:1)410 °C and elevated pressures (120(cid:1)340 bar). Around
0.33 g-CH4 g-feedstock¡1 was observed, close to equilibrium yield
(0.34 g-CH4 g-wood¡1). The product gas contained 49% CH4 at 404 °C
and 310 bar. They reported that carbon gasification efficiency was
dependent upon reaction times. Complete gasification was obtained

Pwith longer reaction time of about 1.5 h. The liquid phase was dem-
onstrated to be colorless, free of tar and residual char (< 2 wt. % of
feed C) at supercritical reaction conditions. This work proves the via-
bility of hydrothermal gasification, especially for wet biomass such
as MSW, sludge and manure to produce renewable bio-methane.

PUK Department of Transport has funded a £5 million bio-meth-
ane project which is operated by a consortium including Advanced
Plasma Power, National Grid and Progressive Energy [487].
Advanced Plasma Power has developed a pilot plant which success-
fully generates CH4 employing wastes from the homes in Swindon
as the feedstock. The pilot plant gasifies RDF which is produced from
the mixed household waste, to generate a synthesis gas. This gas is
cleaned in an elevated temperature plasma furnace to crack tars and
other contaminants, followed by a series of catalyzed reactions to
generate CH4. The first production of methane was achieved in Au-
gust 2016. This project clearly reflects the technical, commercial
and environmental viability and advantages of natural gas genera-
tion from the waste.

PThe Goteborg Biomass Gasification (GoBiGas) project (Table 15) is
an exemplary example of bio-methane generation via BG-derived
syngas [488]. This project was executed by Goteborg Energi, funded
by the Swedish Energy Agency and recognized by the European
Commission. The project employs forestry wastes as a raw material
to produce syngas via gasification, followed by syngas purification
and upgrading to bio-methane in a methanation plant. The quality of
bio-methane generated is equivalent to NG and, therefore, both are
mixed and fed into the same grid. It is developed in two stages (cid:1) the
first stage which comprises the gasification plant to generate 20 MW
gas has been operational since 2013, while the second stage
(80(cid:1)100 MW gas) will be in operation in 2016. By 2020, the project
forecasts to deliver bio-methane equivalent to 1 TWh (fuel for
»100,000 cars). Such projects are crucial for the technology develop-
ment and should be strongly promoted as they generate useful
renewable energy without causing any adverse impact on the envi-
ronment via carbon emissions.

7.2. Catalysts and reactors

P7.2.1. Catalysts

PCatalysts play an important role in syngas conversion to bio-
methane and have a close relationship with reactor design. Reactor
design is a function of type of catalysts, their activity and selectivity.
They also have a direct impact on upstream and downstream pro-
cesses. Typically employed catalysts contain active metal, support
and promoters. Nickel was the first catalyst employed by the inven-
tors of methanation [473]. Now, even 100 years later, due to its high
activity and selectivity coupled with low cost, this is the first choice
for commercial-scale bio-methane generation. Ru is the most active
catalyst for methanation but is seldom employed for large-scale
applications on account of its very high cost (almost 120 times that
of Ni) [489,490]. Co, Fe and Mo are other methanation catalysts
[439,491(cid:1)494].

PSupports for active metals are also important components to
evaluate while choosing a catalyst. They positively affect the activity
and selectivity of the process to a considerable extent [481]. Metal
oxides with large surface area such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, etc., form
the primary choices for supports [495]. Among these g-modified
Al2O3 is mostly employed. Sometimes, a further improvement to
supported catalyst is achieved with the aid of promoters. Promoters
enhance the characteristics and catalytic performance; e.g., thermal
stability and carbon resistance in Ni/Al2O3 is increased with the
addition of MgO [496]. Ni dispersion and H2 uptake are increased in
Ni/Al2O3 by La2O3 leading to better activity [497]. The surface mor-
phology of Mo catalysts is improved resulting in the enhancement
of S resistance, by adding Co promoters [498].

PCatalysts are subject to deactivation due to chemical (catalyst
poisoning, formation of Ni carbonyls) [499,500], mechanical (fouling,
attrition, crushing) [485,501] and/or thermal (thermal degradation)
[501] mechanisms. The presence of contaminants such as sulphur in
syngas leads to its chemisorption in catalytic sites and results in poi-
soning. Ni undergoes vapour-solid interactions with its support or
promoters and can form carbonyls below 230 °C in the presence
of CO. Catalyst particles also break down due to thermal and/or
mechanical stress and lose activity. Moreover, fouling can also be a
key reason for catalyst deactivation in which coke or tars are depos-
ited over the Ni surface and render it inactive. These issues can be
tackled by employing stringent syngas cleaning and processing. In
addition, regulating operational variables such as temperature and
pressure can also be beneficial in combating catalyst deactivation.

P7.2.2. Reactors

PThe availability of BG-derived syngas fluctuates on account of the
variation in the obtainable biomass feedstock. This calls for continu-
ous optimization of the existing bio-methane production approaches
via temperature control, process flexibility and cost effectiveness.
R&D work is going on worldwide to achieve these objectives by
upgrading the designs of conventional reactors as well as developing
new reactor technologies. Bio-methane reactors can be classified as
FXB, FB and three-phase reactors [470]. They can also be categorized
as adiabatic, isothermal and polytropic reactors, based on their
temperature profile.

P7.2.2.1. Fixed bed reactors.
PFXB reactors are the oldest reactor type to
be employed for bio-methane generation. Much research has been
conducted to upgrade their design in order to achieve better temper-
ature control and process flexibility. Proper temperature control
results in high quality bio-methane production. Moreover, it also
reduces the requirement for process equipment such as recycle com-
pressors and heat exchangers, which lead to cost-effective produc-
tion of bio-methane [502]. Investigations are being carried out on
adiabatic or polytropic FXB reactors. Temperature hot-spots in beds,
high exit temperatures and sharp pressure drops are major limita-
tions associated with these reactor types [470]. In order to overcome
these drawbacks, structured reactors (e.g., honeycomb reactor) with
modified internal structures have been developed. They have
improved heat transfer with reduced pressure drop [503(cid:1)506].

PThe micro-reactor is an advanced version of structured reactors
with high surface-to-volume ratio, which offers better temperature
control. However, placing catalyst on the metallic bed and replacing
it on deactivation is tedious [504]. The sorption-enhanced reactor is
also one of the improved versions of structured reactors. The ther-
modynamic restriction of carbon oxide conversion to bio-methane is
reduced to a significant extent in this type, by the adsorption of H2O
produced during the process through catalyst support [507,508].
The adsorbent
is revived by temperature- or pressure-swing
approaches, once it is completely loaded with H2O. Structured reac-
tors follow polytropic temperature profiles. They have the best per-
formance with only moderate hot spots formation as well as
enhanced reaction and conversion rates. However, they are the most
costly among all available designs.

P7.2.2.2. Fluidised bed reactors.
PUniform temperature distribution and
effective heat removal are key attributes of FB reactors. This is the
reason for using a single reactor rather than reactor cascades (as in
the case with FXB). These reactors are isothermal in nature which
ensures absolute carbon oxide conversion to bio-methane [470].
However, limited reaction rate and fluidisation of catalysts are key
drawbacks. These lead to catalyst attrition and mechanical stress on
the walls, which in turn result in shorter reactor life. Several investi-
gations [509,510] are on-going to develop novel catalysts to alleviate
this problem. FB reactors are being examined by many research

Pgroups and industries to investigate methanation from BG-derived
syngas [485,511]. A power-to-gas demonstration facility employing
FB for gasification and bio-methane generation is being commis-
sioned by Engie Gas Company, France [470].

P7.2.2.3. Three - phase reactors.
PThe three(cid:1)phase reactor concept is a
type of isothermal reactor with improved reactor temperature con-
trol due to its liquid phase with high heat capacity [480]. Also, during
high load variations, it can be maintained at isothermal process con-
ditions. It is a modern design with enhanced performance; however,
decomposition of heat transfer liquid and additional gas-liquid mass
transfer make the operation costly. Researchers are studying the
hydrodynamics of the reactor to improve heat transfer fluid stability
and to develop specific catalysts [470,512,513].

7.3. Thermodynamic modelling

PEquilibrium modelling for bio-methane generation plants is car-
ried out to achieve diverse objectives such as concept comparison,
process and heat integration, efficiency evaluation and data collec-
tion for economic and ecological assessments. It has proved to be a
trustworthy and powerful engineering tool to evaluate vital parame-
ters in a short time with great precision and low cost. Table 17 sum-
marises some important equilibrium modelling investigations for
biomass-to-bio-methane production.

PMolino and co-authors [517] developed an equilibrium model for
bio-methane generation via BG employing different configurations.
They reported CH4 yield of 0.4 Nm3 Nm¡3-syngas with a purity of
65 vol. % and calorific value of 23 MJ Nm¡3 in single-stage methana-
tion. Inserting a WGS reactor prior to the methanation reactor
improved the purity and heat content to 80 vol. % and 26 MJ Nm¡3,
respectively. This simulation study was carried out using a local bio-
mass, with isothermal conditions for bio-methane production. They
proposed the use of an isothermal reactor to enhance process perfor-
mance; however, its management is more difficult than a conven-
tional adiabatic reactor. It can be inferred from the study that by
employing an isothermal configuration for bio-methane generation
it is possible to improve the performance and this can be a promising
substitute for conventional configurations. However, demonstration
plants are required to evaluate the viability of the proposal.

PMunicipal solid waste generation is inevitable in every civilized
society in the world. Therefore, its proper and efficient treatment is
indispensable. Various research studies are on-going worldwide to
utilize MSW to generate usable fuel/power. Gasification of biomass
has turned out to be one of the feasible pathways. Zhu et al. [528]

Table 17
Significant modelling studies for biomass-to-bio-methane.

Pmodelled green bio-methane production via MSW gasification
employing different MSW compositions. The impact of operational
variables such as ER, steam-to-MSW ratio and methanation pressure
on process efficiencies and bio-methane quality were also evaluated.
They used paper, wood, textiles and kitchen wastes and found the
best results for textile feedstock with a gas yield of 0.406 Nm3 kg¡1
and energy conversion of 82%. It was noted that the high volatile
content in textiles is able to produce more light gases during reac-
tions. Generated gas contained around 88% bio-methane (average)
with a lower heating value of 32 MJ m¡3. Carbon conversion, energy
conversion and overall efficiencies were reported as around 19%,
39% and 28%, respectively. Moreover, an increase in ER and steam-
to-MSW ratio leads to a decrease in bio-methane yield whereas
increase in methanation pressure enhances CH4 concentrations.

PA detailed second law analysis of biomass-to-bio-methane gener-
ation via wood gasification was carried out by Juraic and co-workers
[515]. They performed an exergetic evaluation to assess process per-
formance vis-(cid:1)a-vis conditions in the gasifier and methanation reac-
tors. The system comprised a gasification reactor, gas processing
unit, compressor, methanation reactors and bio-methane processing
unit. The gasifier, followed by the methanation reactors, were found
to be the sources of maximum internal exergy losses. The gasifier
was operated at 700 °C with a variable pressure from 1 to 15 bar It
was reported that an increase in gasifier pressure enhanced exer-
getic efficiency whereas increased temperature of the methanation
reactors increased irreversibilities. They found a maximum exergetic
efficiency of 72.6% with optimum operating conditions (gasifier tem-
perature = 700 °C, pressure = 1 bar, first methanation reactor temper-
ature = 580 °C, second methanation reactor temperature = 405 °C).
This kind of study is helpful to examine technical challenges and
analyse the economics of the whole system.

8. Bio-hydrogen (H2)

PConsidering its avoidance of point source CO2 emissions, hydro-
gen is the most promising energy carrier among all the existing fuels.
It finds its key applications in fuel cells as well as in the synthesis of
numerous useful chemical feedstocks such as MeOH, EtOH, etc., and
may find future applications in decarbonisation of heat and industry.
A large number of research investigations are proceeding worldwide
to use H2 as an automotive fuel. It has the highest energy density
(LHV » 120 MJ kg¡1) among all conventional fuels, which is almost
3 times that of gasoline and, therefore, could offer a promising sub-
stitute for gasoline as transportation fuel provided storage issues are
resolved [529]. Furthermore, there are no toxic emissions from H2

Pcombustion unlike gasoline and diesel. In addition, hydrogen can be
stored in different forms such as in gas phase, liquid phase or as
metal hydrides, albeit given its low density H2 storage is an issue.
However, most of the H2 generation pathways are expensive with
low efficiencies on account of immature technologies [530].

PHydrogen can be generated either via a thermochemical or bio-
logical pathway. These routes may employ biomass, fossil fuels and/
or water as the raw material, with the application of thermal, electri-
cal or photonic energy [531]. A brief analysis of all the H2 production
technologies along with normalized energy and exergy efficiencies,
advantages and limitations is summarised in Table 19. Energy effi-
ciency is given by the ratio of the heating value of syngas to the heat-
ing value of feedstock. On the other hand, exergetic efficiency is the
ratio of physical and chemical exergy of syngas to the chemical
exergy of biomass raw material and is based on the second law of
thermodynamics. Among all the prevalent routes, steam methane
reforming is most widely used and is responsible for around 50% of
worldwide H2 production, followed by oil reforming (30%) [532].
The major drawback with these methods is significant GHG emis-
sions resulting in adverse environmental change. One of
the
solutions can be green H2 (or bio-hydrogen) generation via thermo-
chemical processes such as combustion, pyrolysis and gasification of
renewable and abundantly available biomass. It can be seen from
Table 18 that among all the H2 production pathways BG has the
highest exergetic efficiency of 60% [531]. A discussion about

Table 18

Pdifferent gasification routes employing biomass can be found in the
subsequent section.

8.1. H2 generation pathways via gasification

PBio-hydrogen can be generated by steam reforming of char
produced during fast pyrolysis of biomass. It can also be produced
via supercritical water gasification; however, this approach is
mainly employed for wet biomass. Conventional gasification of
biomass employing steam or oxygen as gasifying agents is the
commonly applied method to generate H2. Both gasifying agents
result in a product gas with around 40% H2 content under normal
operating conditions; however, steam is preferred over O2 for gen-
erating H2 in a gasifier on account of reasons such as (1) higher
reactor temperature in case of O2 (1000-1400 °C) as compared to
steam (700-1200 °C) and (2) oxygen-blown gasification is costlier
than steam-blown BG [539].

P8.1.1. Steam gasification of fast pyrolysis-derived char

PPyrolysis is the thermochemical conversion of biomass into
usable fuels or chemical feedstocks. It takes place in the absence of
O2. However, some amount of O2 is provided for partial combustion
in cases where heat is required for the process [540]. Biomass con-
version via pyrolysis in the absence of O2 is depicted in its simplest
form in Eq. (37). It mainly produces liquid products with a low

Bio-oil is a thick viscous liquid containing more than 350 compounds
and is obtained as the key product of biomass fast pyrolysis, along
with char [25]. The produced char is highly reactive in nature and
can be employed to generate H2 via steam gasification. Product gas
generated is a function of char composition and operating variables.
A few researchers [539] have performed experimental studies on
char and lignin gasification to evaluate H2 and other bitumen gas
yields. Steam was used as the gasifying medium with a flow rate of
10 g h¡1 g-feedstock¡1, in a FXB in a temperature range of 600(cid:1)800 °
C. The range of bio-hydrogen yield was reported to be 30(cid:1)50%. It
was an important study to reveal the potential of H2 recovery from
pyrolysis-derived char.

P8.1.2. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG)

PSupercritical water with co-existing gas and liquid phases can
serve as a reactive species employed for the treatment of high-
moisture biomass such as sewage and other kinds of sludge,
it has
MSW, etc.
enhanced transport and solubilisation properties
It
behaves as a homogeneous non-polar solvent with exceptional
diffusivity and transport characteristics with an ability to dis-
solve any organic compound [539].

In the supercritical state (374 °C, 220 bar),

[542].

PWhen BG takes place in supercritical water, it acts as an oxidant.
Oxygen atoms from supercritical water interact with C atoms of bio-
mass to generate CO, which in turn reacts with steam to produce H2
and CO2 via WGS [93]. In terms of H2 production efficiency, this
pathway is a better choice. However, it is more suitable for wet bio-
mass because water present in the wet biomass is not a liability as it
is in thermal gasification. On the other hand, this water acts as a
reaction medium and a reactant. However, the cost of H2 production
via this route is many times higher than the conventional method of
steam methane reforming due to a high energy penalty. Therefore,
R&D is still in progress to reduce the cost by recovering energy, prior
to scaling up.

P8.1.3. Steam gasification of biomass

PAs discussed earlier, BG is a thermochemical process to convert
biomass into a mixture of gases, predominantly CO and H2 in the
presence of air, O2 or steam. It employs a complex network of reac-
tions with overlapping steps of drying, pyrolysis and partial oxida-
tion. H2 is the dominant fraction among other gases in the product
gas when steam is employed as gasifying agent [25]. This method is
considered an efficient route to generate green H2 without leaving

Pany carbon footprint [543]. This pathway reduces the limitations of
other thermochemical methods to a great extent such as high energy
consumption and low H2 yield [540]. In addition, it generates lower
amounts of tars and char as WGS converts them to product gas,
thereby enhancing H2 yields. The key reactions to produce H2 via
steam BG are shown in Table 3.

PThe fraction of H2 in the product gas is a function of a number of
variables such as biomass feedstock, operating temperature and
pressure, S/B ratio, catalyst and sorbent-to-biomass ratio (in the
case of sorption-enhanced gasification) [536]. They all have a direct
impact on H2 yield and, therefore, must be taken into account. The
influence of various process parameters on H2 yield during steam BG
is depicted in Table 19.

PA few researchers [544] have also employed co-gasification of
biomass feedstock and coal to evaluate the viability of the process
along with the H2 yields. They carried out experimental investiga-
tions using bagasse and coal in a FB gasifier. It was reported that tar
and gaseous HC yields were a function of bagasse amount and
encountered the formation of increasing tars and HCs by enhancing
air flow rate and operating temperature. Maximum H2 yield of 45%
(in total product gas composition) was found at a bed temperature
of 885 °C. It should be noted that addition of coal to the feedstock
increases S content in the syngas.

PGarcia-Labiano and co-authors [545] have evaluated the possibil-
ity of employing bio-EtOH as fuel in a chemical looping reforming
(CLR) process to generate H2 with negative CO2 emissions. They per-
investigations in a continuous CLR unit
formed experimental
(1 kWth) for more than 50 h in the presence of two different NiO-
based oxygen carriers. Hydrogen-rich syngas (61 vol. %) with 32 vol.
% CO was obtained in the fuel reactor and pure N2 was released via
the air reactor. The composition of syngas was close to equilibrium
values. They reported complete conversion of the fuel coupled with
no carbon formation. This study reflects the potential for producing
H2 employing renewable fuel, with an added advantage of negative
carbon emissions.

8.2. Thermodynamics of H2 production

PMany thermodynamic modelling studies for BG-coupled H2 pro-
duction systems have been carried out either to optimize the system
or to evaluate the feasibility of a new system. El-Emam and Dincer
[178] developed a model of BG integrated with a SOFC to examine
the parametric impact. An atmospheric BFB gasifier was employed
to produce H2-rich syngas with steam as the gasifying medium, and
the generated H2 was fed to the SOFC to generate power. S/B ratio
has a direct influence while operating temperature was found to
have an adverse impact on gasification performance. The optimum
S/B ratio was found to be 0.677. The authors also reported that SOFC

Pfuel utilization has more impact than recirculation ratio, on fuel cell
performance. This study reflects the promising nature of the BG-cou-
pled SOFC system for renewable power generation.

PBeheshti et al. [546] developed an equilibrium model for a proton
exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) coupled with BG. Bio-hydro-
gen derived from gasification was used as a fuel for the PEMFC. An
Aspen Plus simulator and FORTRAN subroutines were employed to
simulate the steady state behavior of the entire system. Significant
operating variables such as ER, S/B, feedstock moisture, feed gas
humidity and current density were investigated vis-(cid:1)a-vis cold gas
efficiency and fuel cell potential. Gasification efficiency was reported
as 75.85% and cell potential as 752.8 mW keeping optimum values
(ER - 0.49, S/B - 0.5, moisture - 5% and feedstock size(cid:1)2 mm) for the
studied variables. It was demonstrated that feed humidity has a
direct influence whereas feedstock moisture has an adverse impact
on output voltage. It can be inferred from the study that it is viable
to integrate PEMFC with BG and has a potential to generate high vol-
tages provided optimum operating conditions are maintained.

PIribarren and co-authors [547] performed exergetic and LCA anal-
yses for H2 generation via BG. Poplar was used as the feedstock in a
low-pressure indirect gasifier. Catalytic tar cracking, cold gas clean
up, syngas conversion and H2 purification were taken as sub-sys-
tems along with gasification. The maximum exergetic efficiency was
found to be 48% which is equivalent to H2 production via coal gasifi-
cation. In life cycle assessment, the authors considered the steps
from poplar cultivation to H2 purification. Cumulative energy
demand, global warming, ozone layer degradation, photochemical
oxidant formation, land competition, acidification and eutrophica-
tion were taken as impact variables. Poplar cultivation, biomass pre-
treatment and syngas clean-up were found to have maximum envi-
ronmental impact. Reduction in poplar demand, improvement in
logistics to supply biomass feedstock, reduction in natural gas
demand for steam reforming and low consumption of fertilizers
were suggested as the solution. These equilibrium studies along
with cradle-to-grave LCA investigation give a clear and more realis-
tic picture of renewable H2 generation, and enable scientists to work
on a more practical basis.

PCohce et al. [548] designed an equilibrium model comprising BG
followed by steam methane reforming and WGS. They used the
Gibbs free energy minimization approach with chemical equilibrium
considerations. Oil palm shell material was employed as biomass
feedstock to produce H2. They found energy and exergy efficiencies
of 22 and 19%, respectively. The cold gas efficiency was reported to
be 18%. They demonstrated a higher H2 production rate with this
system (3700 kg h¡1 H2 from 88,400 kg h¡1 oil palm shell) than from
the conventional system (17 kg h¡1 H2 from 900 kg h¡1 dry bagasse).
PWang and co-authors [549] have employed a distinctive
approach to develop a thermodynamic model for co-gasification of
biomass and coal to generate H2 over CaCO3 catalyst. They divided
single FB gasification into two steps, namely, combustion and gasifi-
cation. The combustion model was generated to evaluate the resid-
ual char, whereas the gasification model was developed to examine
H2 yield vis-(cid:1)a-vis CaO catalyst. Parameters such as gasifier tempera-
ture, coal-to-biomass ratio, steam-to-coke ratio and calcium-to-coke
ratio were found to have a profound influence on H2 yield. Maximum
H2 yield was reported to be 60% at 800(cid:1)850 °C. Optimum values for
coal-to-biomass ratio, steam-to-coke ratio and calcium-to-coke ratio
were suggested as 0.25, 1.8 and 0.5, respectively.

8.3. H2 as an automotive propellant

PGreen H2 generated from a renewable energy source such as bio-
mass has the potential to replace fossil fuels as transportation fuel. It
will reduce GHG and other toxic gaseous emissions to a significant
extent. Research on H2 as an automotive fuel has been on-going for
almost half a century. It has long been investigated as primary fuel

Pand also as an additive (supplemental fuel) for gasoline engines. Its
ability to extend the combustibility range of the fuel-air mixture,
enhance engine efficiency and reduce toxic emissions makes it an
attractive option as an automotive propellant [529]. Furthermore, it
has the highest energy-mass coefficient among all existing conven-
tional fuels.

PFlame travels at a faster speed (2.65(cid:1)3.25 m s¡1) inside the cylin-
der when H2 is employed as fuel in an IC engine [550,551]. Flame
velocity is a function of the temperature of the H2-air mixture and
increases with temperature. This high velocity coupled with low
activation energy of H2 and wide range of combustibility, results in
uncontrolled combustion with sudden rise in pressure inside the cyl-
the phenomenon of knocking occurs on
inder. Consequently,
account of shock wave generation leading to enhancement in heat
discharge to the cylinder walls and an upsurge in mechanical losses
[529]. These problems are not found in the case of gasoline-air mix-
ture combustion, to such an extent. Table 20 compares physical and
chemical properties of gasoline and H2.

PA blend of H2 and air is more homogeneous than a mixture of
gasoline-air resulting in reduced cyclic fluctuations [529]. In addi-
tion, it also ensures uniform distribution of H2-air in the cylinder.
The wide range of combustibility allows 4 to 75% of H2 presence in
the air-fuel ratio (0.13 to 10.2). This eliminates the need of regulat-
ing the mixture qualitatively as in the case with diesel, leading to
removal of the throttle valve and finally significant reduction in
mechanical losses [529]. Furthermore, employing only H2 eradicates
soot, HCs, CO, SOx and NOx formations in the emissions.

PAt stoichiometry, due to the low density of H2, it occupies 30% of
the cylinder volume whereas gasoline occupies only 2(cid:1)4%. This
means that for equal energy, a storage tank for H2 is almost 30 times
in mass and 24 times in volume as compared to gasoline. Conse-
quently, when pure H2 is employed as automotive fuel, a reduction
in engine horse power occurs of 20(cid:1)25% [553]. Furthermore, work
done by a unit volume of H2 mixture is around 910 kJ m¡3 while it is
1320 kJ m¡3 for gasoline. If H2 is directly fed into the engine cylinder,
heat released is 20% more [554]. Therefore, the power factor of the
engine is a function of how H2 is introduced into the cylinder. High
reaction ability of H2 can cause backfiring [529]. Moreover, its low
ignition energy causes the appearance of flame in the carburettor.
However, such problems can be minimized to a considerable extent
by employing a lean mixture or H2O injection into cylinders.

PIt is noted that liquid H2 has a poor heat of combustion of around
25% that of gasoline [529]. It also requires high thermal insulation.
The storage of gaseous H2 is a major challenge as it requires large

Pvolumes and is susceptible to loss via evaporation [550], thus mak-
ing it a poor choice to be employed as primary transportation fuels.
However, H2 is an excellent blending agent. If added to a blend of air
and gasoline in some amounts (5(cid:1)10%), it improves all vital factors
in the engine and reduces liquid fuel consumption by 30(cid:1)40% [551].
In addition, toxicity of the emissions is significantly reduced. H2 can
also be employed as an intermediate to propel vehicles. Currently,
several studies are in progress to develop H2-driven fuel cells, which
in turn would run vehicles. Thus for instance, Toyota Motor Corpora-
tion is about to launch the first fuel cell vehicle (FCV) called Mirai, in
the market [555]. Development in fuel cell technology and H2 stor-
age methods can enable successful deployment of H2 as transporta-
tion fuel. It can potentially bring about a revolutionary reduction in
fossil fuel usage and favourable alteration in climate change.

9. Algae-derived biofuels

PAlgae are unicellular (micro-algae) or multicellular (macro-algae)
photosynthetic organisms capable of converting sunlight, CO2 and
H2O to significant amounts of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and
other bioactive species, in a short duration [556,557]. They are found
in fresh and salty water and possess an enormous potential for con-
version into usable fuels. They are one of the potentially attractive
options to generate renewable and sustainable biofuels, also known
as third generation biofuels. They have numerous benefits such as
the capability to fix large amounts of CO2 (1 kg of micro-algae syn-
thesis takes 1.8 kg of CO2) [558,559], ability to grow in any environ-
ment (sea/fresh water, on land) [560], very high growth rate (a
doubling rate of 24 h) [47,559], and versatile usage (food, animal
feed, fertilizer, waste H2O treatment).

PConversion of algal biomass to a wide spectrum of biofuels such
as EtOH, H2, diesel and biogas is possible via biochemical and ther-
mochemical routes. Thermochemical routes are considered better
than the former on account of short reaction times, high conversion
efficiencies and comparatively low costs [47,561]. All the possible
algae-to-fuel and -power conversion processes are depicted in
Fig. 27. In the gasification approach to thermochemical processing,
algal biomass is typically heated with O2, air or steam in deficient
conditions (or in the absence of air/O2) to generate syngas. This
product gas can be directly utilized as fuel for boilers or can be
employed as raw material for MeOH or DME production. Direct com-
bustion, liquefaction (hydrothermal processing) and pyrolysis are
alternative thermochemical methods to convert algae into usable
fuels, power and electricity [556]. A significant number of investiga-
tions to exploit unicellular and multicellular algae are reported in
the literature. Biofuels generation from macroalgae via liquefaction

P[562] and pyrolysis [47,563], and from microalgae via liquefaction
[564-566], pyrolysis [6,567(cid:1)569] and gasification [564,570(cid:1)572]
have all received significant attention.

PGasification process chemistry employing micro-algal biomass
has already been discussed in Section 3.1.1. BG is best suited for
feedstock up to 15% moisture content [573]; however, researchers
have used algae with high moisture content (»40%) as raw material
for BG [47]. This has an adverse effect on gasifier performance and
calorific content of the product gas. The heat content of product gas
with 5 to 30% moisture ranges from 3.45 to 5.9 MJ kg¡1 [194]. The
various steps involved in micro-algae gasification are shown in
Fig. 28.

PHirano and co-authors [574] investigated gasification of Spirulina
at different temperatures (850, 950 and 1000 °C) in the presence of
O2. Algae slurry was fed at a rate of 0.25 g min¡1 and O2 at
0.39 mL min¡1. The syngas generated was composed of CO, H2, CH4
and CO2 with traces of O2, N2 and C2H4. An increase in temperature
enhanced the H2 fraction at the cost of CO, CO2 and CH4. It was
reported that elevating the temperature from 850 to 1000 °C
increased the carbon conversion efficiency from 93 to 100%. It
should be noted that the gasifier temperature has a key impact on
product gas composition as well as on carbon conversion.

PNumerous researchers have employed fresh water micro-algae
Chlorella as the feedstock for gasification studies. Minowa et al. [571]
investigated C. Vulgaris gasification over Ni catalyst in a N2 cycling

Psystem at 350 °C to produce CH4. Higher catalyst amounts resulted in
higher CH4 and lower H2 concentrations. Moreover, the carbon con-
version efficiency and product gas yield were found to increase on
account of catalyst loading. An important observation was the con-
version of N present in the feedstock to NH3, which can further be
transformed to premium quality fertilizer.

PAs algal biomass contains a high amount of moisture, it forms an
appropriate feedstock material for SCWG. Chakinala and co-workers
[570] examined C. Vulgaris as raw material for catalytic and non-
catalytic SCWG using different catalysts. They found that the use of
Ni catalyst at relatively high loadings results in H2-rich gas on
account of improved WGS activity. The gasification efficiency was
reported to improve (»84%) at 600 °C with 2 min residence time.
The authors also employed excess Ru/TiO2 catalyst and obtained
100% gasification of the biomass at 700 °C. The investigation proved
the significance of elevated process temperatures, lean algae slurry
and longer residence times in optimizing gasification to achieve
maximum efficiency.

PAn important investigation using S. Platensis was carried out by
Stucki and co-authors [572]. They cultivated the algae using CO2
emissions from fossil fuels followed by their transformation to
usable fuels via SCWG with absolute mineralization of nutrient-
bearing organics. They obtained a CH4-rich syngas over Ru catalyst
and concentrated CO2 for storage. Around 60(cid:1)70% of the calorific
content in the algal biomass was recovered as CH4. Carbon conver-
sion was reported to be 50%. This must be considered to be a key
study which explored a viable route for renewable bio-methane
generation to counter fossil fuel dependence and climate change,
without also competing with food production.

PAll the investigations prove that catalyst loading and elevated
temperatures during algal gasification are vital parameters to
enhance H2 and/or CH4 yields. Dolomite, Ni and potassium carbonate
are typically employed catalysts [123]. Ni-based catalysts are found
to decrease tar generation by about 5% in the temperature range of
500-900 °C [575]. The presence of catalysts can increase gasification
efficiency by up to 85% [570]. If thermochemical treatment such as
gasification of algae is envisaged to occur at scale, then algae need to
be cultivated in large amounts to serve as the feedstock. Algae has
the potential to remove/degrade organic pollutants in aquatic sys-
tems for their own growth apart from generating energy and, there-
fore, act as a controlling-agent for the pollutants [576,577]. All the
investigations reflect the significant potential of algal biomass as a
raw material for sustainable biofuels with promising bioremediation
capabilities. The high growth rate of algae as compared to all other
biomass feedstocks and the avoidance of arable land for its produc-
tion have the potential to enhance the sustainability of biofuels
which in turn can reduce pressure on non-renewable energy sources
such as fossil fuels.

PThe idea of using algae for biofuels is an area which is receiving
increasing attention, with over 3900 publications listed in this area
by Scopus since the beginning of 2013, and numerous scenarios are
being generated for possible applications of biofuel over the next
two decades [578]. Currently, algae-based fuels are in the research
and development stage and as such they have been classified as third
generation fuels in a recent European Union Report [579], with bio-
fuels from crops and animal sources being classified as first genera-
tion, fuels and lignocellulosic biomass as second generation fuels;
moreover it is anticipated that algae-based fuels are likely to need
significant innovation if they are to become commercially important
[579]. A major concern with one promising development, namely
that of genetically modifying algae is the need to keep such a plant
clean and free of invasion from natural organisms which is likely to
be challenging for large-scale applications [579]. As with biofuels in
general, another critical issue is to ensure that the production of
algae-based fuels does not compete with agricultural land for food
and feed markets, but here algae-based approaches have an obvious

Ppotential advantage. The economics of developing such fuels is also
questionable given the high overall potential cost of such fuels, and
there is a suggestion that developing them for use in high value pro-
cesses and applications such as pharmaceuticals might well repre-
sent a bridging approach, justifying the expense of developing algae
biofuels per se [580].

10. Process design and integration

PBiomass has undoubtedly proven itself as a potential renewable
energy resource which can meet global energy needs to a significant
extent. However, this calls for a suitable biomass-to-energy conver-
sion technology, which in turn necessitates a proper and sustainable
process design. Among all the available choices for a given system,
not all the options are viable, efficient and cost-effective. Selection
of suitable process configurations which result in optimal plant
designs is crucial. In addition, decisions regarding production capac-
ity and plant scale are important for efficient and sustainable opera-
tion. Prior to installation, a trade-off between large centralized
production plants and smaller decentralized plants is required.

PProcess integration is an all-inclusive approach which considers
all the interactions among different steps within a process. The
objective is to enhance overall process efficiency by elevated product
yields with minimum costs. It is a powerful tool in process design
investigations to optimize current processes and develop new pro-
cesses. Integrating energy streams and process intensification are
two commonly employed approaches for process integration [23].
The former is the integration of energy streams within a system,
where high-temperature streams with surplus heat provide thermal
energy to those with heat deficits, minimizing external heat
requirements. The latter is concerned with the design and devel-
opment of novel technologies to improve chemical processes and
aim to operate them closer to fundamental limiting rates. An
example is the deployment of advanced process configurations
with an aim to reduce equipment volume and decrease energy
consumption coupled with an enhancement in production inten-
sity and sustainability.

PIn this section, the bio-refinery concept is discussed in detail fol-
lowed by some important process design and integration studies.
Moreover, decisive factors related to efficient and economical instal-
lation and operation of bio-refineries are elucidated.

10.1. Lignocellulosic biomass-based bio-refinery

PA bio-refinery is a facility which integrates conversion processes
and equipment to produce biofuels and chemicals employing diverse
biomass types. Numerous conversion technologies are combined to
produce a variety of products such as transportation fuels and other
chemicals from biomass feedstock via gasification and fermentation.
Bio-refineries are classified by the nature of the biomass used, e.g.,
crops such as cereals are employed in crop bio-refineries whereas
cellulosic biomass (wood, straw, etc.) is used in a lignocellulosic
bio-refinery. A lignocelluosic biomass-based integrated bio-refinery
concept is depicted in Fig. 29.

PA bio-refinery is analogous to a petroleum refinery where an
input feedstock yields diverse usable outputs. However, the differ-
ence lies in the input material for the biorefinery due to large varia-
tion in biomass properties which necessitates divergence in
methods to obtain useful products. Pulp and paper mills can be
termed as bio-refineries on account of their ability to produce
numerous usable products employing biomass [28,581]. Presently,
many research studies are underway to establish large-scale produc-
tion of multiple products, which are now only obtained by petro-
refineries. The basic objective is to generate high-value chemicals as
well as high-volume biofuels to cater to energy requirements while
ensuring viable process economics.

Fig. 29. Schematic of lignocellulosic biomass-based bio-refinery [28].

POne of the important challenges for a bio-refinery is to efficiently
and economically transform 5- and 6-carbon sugars present in
lignocellulosic biomass feedstock into useful products [28]. The ther-
mochemical platform of bio-refineries offers options such as com-
bustion, liquefaction, pyrolysis and gasification to overcome this
challenge [582]. They can process the biomass into syngas, chemi-
cals, liquid fuels, heat and electricity. Ample availability coupled
with its versatility and renewable nature make biomass a highly
promising raw material. However, lower energy density, high fibre,
ash (in some feedstocks) and moisture content, and diverse compo-
sition are some of the limitations associated with the bio-refinery
concept [77]. Installation and successful operation of integrated bio-
fuel and renewable chemical production plants establish the poten-
tial of non-food crops (lignocellulose) around the globe. Vital
technical challenges need to be addressed to reduce the production
cost of biomass-based fuels and chemicals from the bio-refinery.
Only then can significant switching from petro-derived fuels to
biomass-derived fuels take place on a larger scale.

10.2. Some important design and integration investigations

PNumerous significant investigations have been performed to
design and integrate the biomass-to-biofuels conversion process,
with an objective to reduce cost and enhance process efficiency cou-
pled with decreased GHG emissions. Researchers have employed
various approaches such as mixed integer linear programming
(MILP), mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP), site-scale
approach, fuzzy logic approach, modular optimization approach,
etc., to carry out these studies.

PClausen [583] developed a novel design for a gasification-based
bio-refinery. Instead of removing CO2, H2 derived via water or steam
electrolysis was added to the system. This resulted in almost 96% car-
bon conversion which in turn doubled biofuels production per unit
biomass feedstock input. Two different designs of bio-refineries were
made to generate MeOH with integrated H2O electrolysis for extra
H2 production. Torrefied wood was employed as biomass feedstock
in an entrained flow gasifier. In the first design torrefaction was inte-
grated on-site with the gasifier whereas in the second design, torre-
faction was done off-site. The biomass-to-MeOH energy ratio was
much higher (136%) for the former as compared to the latter (101%).
In addition, overall total energy efficiency (MeOH/biomass þ net

Pelectricity) was 62% for the integrated torrefaction design while it
was 56% for the other. However, more electricity was found to be
consumed per unit MeOH produced in the former case. It should be
noted that this approach is not highly desirable as H2 is produced via
electrolysis and, therefore, raises the cost of production.

PNg and co-authors [584] synthesised and optimized an integrated
bio-refinery employing a fuzzy logic optimization approach. The four
parameters under consideration were economic performance, envi-
ronmental influence, inherent safety and occupational health perfor-
mance. A palm oil-based bio-refinery was taken as the case study
and all four parameters were solved in parallel as they are often
incompatible with each other during process synthesis and optimi-
zation in a bio-refinery. They reported that despite the inherent con-
tradictory nature of these parameters, they can be optimized via a
fuzzy logic scheme to transform biomass into primary or secondary
energies. Tay et al. [33] integrated a BG stoichiometric thermody-
namic model with the structural models of synthesis processes with
an objective to evaluate optimal operational conditions to obtain the
maximum amount of syngas with appropriate composition for
diverse end-use applications in an integrated bio-refinery. They
employed the modular optimization route for the synthesis of a gasi-
fication-based bio-refinery with (1) optimum product portfolio and
(2) a variety of feedstocks and products. They reported the genera-
tion of H2-rich syngas with a composition of 42.7 mol. % H2 and
38.9 mol. % CO for case-I and, 41.6 mol. % H2 and 39.8 mol. % CO for
case-II, on a dry basis. Optimized values of temperature, pressure
and S/B were found to be 927 °C, 36.5 bar and, 0.33 (case-I) and 0.36
(case-II), respectively.

PWang et al. [585] developed a MINLP model to optimize a gasifi-
cation-based HC bio-refinery involving economic and environmental
variables and solved it by the e constraint method. All processing
steps such as drying, air separation unit (ASU), BG, syngas process-
ing, FT synthesis, hydro-upgrading, power generation and, diesel
and gasoline production were taken into account. Superstructures
were employed to consider substitute technologies and equipment
such as BG routes, H2 generation sources, cooling options and FT cat-
alysts. The model simultaneously defined technology selection,
operational conditions, flow rates of streams, energy required by
each sub-system, economic performance, equipment sizes and envi-
ronmental effects. They reported that gasification at elevated tem-
peratures coupled with direct cooling, inherent H2 generation and

PCo catalyst is the optimal solution for the best economic and envi-
ronmental performance.

PHolmgren and co-authors [347] integrated different steps in a
BG-based MeOH production system. They developed and compared
energy balances to evaluate the influence of process-integrated dry-
ing compared to import of dried biomass as well as the impact on
power generation due to heat pump integration or district heating
delivery, and influence on MeOH production when H2 is added, and
the effects of adding the MTO process. They reported that the effect
of combining the MTO process is very limited. However, when H2 is
added as a replacement for WGS, the production of MeOH is
enhanced significantly (by »35%). Moreover, it was found that heat
pumping has a positive impact on power generation by the system.
The same authors [586] performed another study where BG-based
MeOH generation is integrated with clusters of industries with an
objective to examine and reduce life cycle GHG emissions. A rise of
10% in the efficiency was found when H2 from an industrial cluster
was added in the system. Moreover, the presence of a heat sink to
use excess heat from the system coupled with technology type has a
vital influence on GHG reduction. For example, a rise in GHG emis-
sions was found when the industrial waste heat is placed as a substi-
tute for the system where heat generation technology in the district
heating network is natural gas combined cycle CHP and the technol-
ogy for marginal electricity generation is coal condensing power,
whereas GHG advantages are more noticeable when fossil boilers
are substituted by industrial excess heat. Furthermore, electricity
generation and district heating were also reported to have an impor-
tant impact on GHG. Damartzis and Zabaniotou [23] developed a
fully integrated biomass-to-liquid conversion system where all
material and heat streams were combined. Feedstock is fed into an
integrated bio-refinery where it undergoes pyrolysis and gasifica-
tion. Char is obtained as a solid product whereas liquid products are
reformed to produce H2 for further hydro-cracking to FT fuels. Gas-
eous products undergo processing and are sent for FT synthesis to
produce FT fuels. Wax from FT synthesis is hydro-cracked to gener-
ate more FT fuels while H2 from liquid products reforming is fed to
the gas processing sub-system. In a nutshell, raw biomass feedstock
is transformed to usable second-generation biofuels via FT synthesis,
with holistic integration of material and heat streams, as depicted in
Fig. 30.

PTock and co-authors [587] have designed a superstructure-based
thermo-economic model to generate biofuels from lignocellulose via
different pathways, with an objective to examine their effectiveness.
Several combinations and technologies were considered for model
development. FT generation, MeOH production, DME production via
biomass (dried with steam/flue gas) employing directly- or indi-
rectly-heated entrained flow or FB gasifiers, hot or cold gas clean-up
and fuel production and upgrading were taken into account. The
competitiveness of various process alternatives was evaluated and
compared vis-(cid:1)a-vis energy efficiency and economic and environ-
mental performance. Efficiencies for these integrated plants for FT

Pfuel, MeOH and DME were reported as 59.8%, 52.5% and 53.5%,
respectively. This work reflects the potential of process integration
enhancing efficiency via waste heat valorisation.

PYou et al. [588] developed a MILP model for optimal design and
planning of EtOH supply chains considering economic, environmen-
tal and social variables. Supply dependence on seasons, topographi-
cal diversity, feedstock degradation and variety, different conversion
pathways and respective by-products, infrastructure compatibility,
demand distribution, local economics and governmental incentives
were taken into account. After this analysis, an improvement in con-
version technology was recommended to commercialize EtOH pro-
duction. Issaksson et al. [581] integrated BG with pulp and paper
mills in order to obtain more valuable products. BG-derived syngas
was employed separately in three energy mills to generate electric-
ity (via GT), MeOH and FT fuels, respectively. These energy mills, in
three different cases were individually integrated with a thermo-
mechanical pulp mill co-located with a saw mill, via the steam cycle.
It was found that electricity production requires the smallest gasifier
while the FT fuels energy mill needs the largest amount of biomass.
Moreover, they reported that the pulp mill acted as a heat sink for
excess heat from the energy mills and, therefore, this integration
resulted in decreased GHG emissions as compared to stand-alone
plants.

PCucek and co-workers [589] employed the MILP route to carry
out multi-period synthesis of an integrated biomass and bioenergy
network. Different sources of biomass were taken to produce first,
second and third generation biofuels such as EtOH, diesel, H2, FT and
green gasoline with an aim to maximize utilization and sustainabil-
ity of resources. Seasonality and availability of resources, products
recycling and total on-site heat integration were considered as key
variables. They observed that the production of second and third
generation biofuels is viable. In addition, they suggested that switch-
grass and algae are the best raw materials for biofuels production.
Most importantly, they found that an integrated bio-refinery net-
work is a potential means to decrease GHG emissions.

PSharifzadeh et al [590] explored alternative biofuel production
systems including biomass production, harvesting, processing and
transport with a particular interest in centralized versus decentral-
ized systems and quantifying the potential for mobile pyrolysis units
coupled with centralized fuel hydro-processing. They demonstrated
that such mobile units would, if cost reductions are possible, be use-
ful in pre-processing dispersed feedstocks such as agricultural resi-
dues, which could then be moved by tanker to processes which
benefit from economies of scale.

10.3. Decisive factors for sustainable bio-refinery

PBiomass is the key input raw material in a bio-refinery and its
diverse physical and chemical composition offers limitations to
design similar biomass supply systems [591]. Moreover, the cost of
lignocellulosic biomass differs vis-(cid:1)a-vis types, sources and collection

Plogistics. Furthermore, it creates a challenge to develop a common
technology to process various kinds of cellulosic biomass. The opera-
tional details of a bio-refinery are also a function of seasonal varia-
tion in biomass production, especially agricultural feedstock [592].
Storing these biomass types for long durations can serve as one solu-
tion. However, space requirements, absorption of moisture and bio-
mass degradation are the outcomes of long-term storage.

PLogistics is another key factor which directly influences the suc-
cessful operation of a bio-refinery. Biomass types from several
decentralized sources need to be transported to a centralized bio-
refinery, which is usually far away. The collection and transportation
costs associated with lighter biomass such as straw, grass, etc., can
be significant, making the generation of usable products very expen-
sive and, therefore, unattractive. Novel bio-refining technologies are
needed which can be employed at small scale near the source. They
can convert low-density low-energy biomass into either highly-
dense biomass (via baling for grass) or intermediates (oil-char
slurry) [593,594]. The Bioliq concept developed in Germany trans-
forms decentralized biomass into high-energy oil-char slurry in their
respective locations, followed by its transportation to centralized
gasification plants. It enhances the energy density of biomass from
about 2 GJ m¡3 to an oil-char slurry which has an energy density of
about 25 GJ m¡3, thereby greatly improving the process economics
[77].

PThe compatibility of bio-refineries with petroleum-based refiner-
ies and their infrastructures is also a vital parameter to ensure long
term sustainability. Existing infrastructures for petro-refineries took
around two centuries to reach the current advanced state [591]. The
compatibility of a bio-refinery with the prevailing set-up would
drastically reduce time and investment in building a new infrastruc-
ture and would definitely have a positive direct impact on its swift
growth. Technologies to produce HC fuels and chemicals well suited
to current infrastructures (instead of oxygenated biofuels and plat-
form chemicals) should be developed.

PIn order to completely substitute petro-derived fuels, chemicals
and polymers by biomass-derived equivalents, an enormous amount
of biomass raw material is needed, which in turn would adversely
influence food crop production [595]. Biomass such as forestry
waste, agricultural waste, MSW, sewage sludge, etc., should be
employed to overcome this challenge. In addition, more R&D to
develop technologies to obtain usable fuels and chemicals via algal
biomass is required.

PFuels and chemicals obtained from bio-refineries must meet
standards in accordance with market requirements and should be
economically competitive with fossil fuel-derived products. Cur-
rently, petro-refineries produce around 90% fuels and 10% chemicals
from crude petroleum [591]. The bio-refinery should follow the
same trend to match the market demand, although it may be
argued that a higher proportion of chemicals may improve economic
viability. In addition, LCA of biomass raw material is recommended
to evaluate socio-environmental and economic effects of an inte-
grated bio-refinery and certification schemes such as the UK's
renewable transport fuels obligation (RTFO) scheme will prevail
[596]. In a nutshell, more research is needed from industry and aca-
demia to develop advanced conversion technologies for multiple
fuel/chemical large-scale production in a cost-effective manner to
replace petroleum-based equivalents.

11. Socio-environmental impact, LCA and ethical issues of
biofuel production

PBiofuels reduce the burden on conventional fuels and, therefore,
should decrease GHG emissions to a considerable extent. They can
also enhance the local economy with increased job opportunities
influence. However, they
and, therefore, have a positive social
can have an adverse impact on society and environment too.

PUnfortunately, while assessing the biofuel generation route, more
emphasis is placed on “positive” subjects such as technology and
economics as compared to factors such as social, safety, environ-
mental and health issues [597]. Chemical accidents, e.g., the explo-
sion in the fertilizer industry in Texas in 2013, oil spill in deep water
in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, etc., forced governments to look into
these aspects and, therefore, stringent laws came into being vis-
(cid:1)a-vis health, safety and environmental methods [598]. These acci-
dents played a key role in raising awareness in society about the sig-
nificance of so-called unprofitable factors. Under stringent laws
coupled with public force, chemical industries are compelled to
employ principles to enhance safety, health and environmental per-
formance.

11.1. Social impact

PExcessive deployment of coal, petroleum and other fossil fuels
has resulted in climate alterations which in turn cause social con-
cerns such as droughts, which further become a root-cause affecting
food security and malnutrition, especially in underdeveloped
nations [599]. By contrast, the increased demand of agricultural
feedstock by biofuels production plants enhances the local economy.
In addition, it creates job prospects and higher income generation.
This is more evident in rural areas of developing nations where pov-
erty and food insecurity exist on a large scale [600]. These factors
may ultimately lead to food supply concerns especially in populous
countries such as China and India. Ewing and co-authors [601] dem-
onstrated that poor people from African countries (Mozambique,
Tanzania, etc.) are more prone to under-nourishment. In the light of
these concerns, rural area development (including upgrading of road
networks) via biofuel production seems a significant and viable
route in diminishing such social issues to a considerable extent
[602]. Kline et al. [603] demonstrate how bioenergy can support
agricultural development and improve security.

PThe development of agriculture and rural economy is a function
of suitable biofuel production and usage policy. According to Tirado
and co-workers [599] biofuel policy should include factors such as
food and nutrition security, poverty reduction planning, land usage
strategy, energy security, employment enhancement and markets
for new products [599]. Land usage is one of the key concerns for
biofuel production especially when lignocellulosic biomass is taken
as feedstock. In this regard, biofuel support policies can play a vital
role in determining land use strategies which have a direct impact
on socio-economic development. Moreover, they should also include
technologies for biomass-to-biofuel conversion to decrease adverse
socio-environmental impact.

PSocial acceptance vis-(cid:1)a-vis socio-political, community and mar-
ket dimensions is also an important factor in biofuel production and
application [604]. Diaz-Chavez [605] has developed indicators to
assess socio-economic sustainability. Proper assessment of social
acceptance can lead to maximization of biofuel development plans.
For example, the adoption of new biomass raw materials/technolo-
gies coupled with novel plant operation, can have unknown influ-
ence on investors and producers. In summary, appropriate biofuel
policy as well as understanding of social acceptance issues repre-
sents the keys to a positive social influence of biofuels.

11.2. Health impact

PThe influence of chemical processes on human and animal health
is usually serious, especially for long-term exposure. Production and
application of biofuels are estimated to have lower health impacts
compared to petro-fuel processing and combustion. Still, there are
adverse effects which may range from mild problems such as eye
and nose irritation to grave health issues such as lung dysfunction,
mutation, cancer and respiratory defects. For instance, application of

Pbiodiesel in CI engines has reduced CO, S, PAH, soot and smoke emis-
sions to a significant extent on account of its oxygenated nature.
However, NOx emissions are enhanced considerably, e.g., around
70% increase in NOx from biodiesel than from conventional petro-
diesel [35].

PEnergy can be directly obtained from raw biomass such as wood
or bagasse by combustion. There are several studies which reflect on
the influence of biomass combustion on human health [606]. Arbex
and co-authors [607,608] found in two different studies, that hyper-
tension and asthma were the outcomes from exposure to total sus-
pended particles (greater than 10 mg m¡3) due to sugarcane
burning. Cancado et al. [609] reported respiratory problems in chil-
dren due to PM of 2.5 mm size with a density of 10.2 mg m¡3 or
more, while PM10 produces the same problem in adults when they
are exposed to 42.9 mg m¡3. Investigators [610] employed Poisson
regression modelling approach to establish a relation between
weight of the sediments and the number of hospital visits. The mod-
els were controlled for the variables such as season, temperature,
day of the week and rainfall. They reported a vital association
between the quantity of sediment and the number of visits. People
who are exposed to 10 mg or more particle sediment are at a higher
risk and are required to be hospitalized for inhalation therapy.
Fig. 31 depicts the impact of various steps and different routes asso-
ciated with biofuels synthesis on human health. To our knowledge,
no in-depth and direct epidemiological study has been conducted to
evaluate the influence of second and third generation biofuels on
human health. It is, therefore, recommended that studies which ana-
lyse the advanced biofuels and their production pathways in detail
with respect to their influence on human and animal health are
needed.

11.3. Environmental impact

PThe influence of biofuels production and usage on the environ-
ment is deep and extensive. A report by Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change reads that enhancement in GHG emissions due to
anthropogenic activities is responsible for global temperature rise
[611]. Since the pre-industrial era, CO2 emissions (35.9 Gt per
annum) were found to be maximum in 2014 [612]. In the Paris
Agreement, 2015, under United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) (COP 21), it was unanimously decided to
limit the world temperature rise by 2 °C with an aspiration to limit it
to 1.5 °C [613]. It should be noted that in order to achieve the goal,
CO2 emissions should be decreased by 50 to 85% by 2050 [598].
Application of biofuels to replace petro-fuels can play a key role to
reduce CO2 emissions, in this case. However, it should be noted that
the influence of biofuel generation on the environment through
influence on water
GHG emissions, generation of co-products,
resources, biodiversity, land usage, etc., should be properly assessed
and analysed for this strategy to be effective.

PIt is crucial to assess the footprint of the chemicals that have
the potential to pose risk on the environment in life cycle analy-
ses. The concentration of a chemical expended or discharged
to the environment on account of anthropogenic activities and
which has the potential to influence global sustainability is
termed its footprint [614]. Cucek and co-authors [615] classify
footprints into carbon, nitrogen, water, energy, land, emission,
biodiversity and others which include phosphorus, waste, human
and fishing grounds.

PSome investigations on environmental footprint have been per-
formed in the biofuels arena. Cucek and co-workers [616] combined
different operational segments in a so-called total site system and
examined the environmental footprints in thermal energy exploita-
tion. A reduction in C, N and H2O footprints was reported on account
of energy integration in a heat-integrated total site system. In
another study, the impact of a transition to biodiesel and EtOH in
the transport sector, on global water footprint, was investigated
[617]. The study demonstrated dramatic results and forecasted a 10-
fold rise in water footprint by 2030 causing more pressure on fresh
H2O resources. Hammond et al. [618] suggested that global foot-
prints (especially carbon and land use) would rise as a consequence
of biofuel generation. They clearly stated that the carbon footprint
for first-generation biofuels is high and this impact can easily be
decreased by employing second-generation fuels. Cucek and co-
authors [619] compared carbon and nitrogen footprints for both bio-
mass and fossil fuels. They reported that biomass displays higher N
footprint and lower C footprint than its counterpart.

PIn general, biofuels were found to be better than fossil fuels in
LCA and footprint studies carried out around the globe. The results
in LCA investigations are inconsistent vis-(cid:1)a-vis energy balance and
environmental influence. This holds true even when the same bio-
mass raw material is employed but with varied farming and con-
version technology for fuel production [620]. These inconsistencies
are due to diverse economic and geographical factors, for example,
raw material, cost, kind of biofuel, weather, etc. Standardized
methodology for analysis coupled with common assumptions can
lead to better results in future studies, which in turn can aid in
designing and developing sustainable biofuel technologies and
applications.

11.4. Life cycle assessment

PLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology that examines
products and services from cradle to grave with a view to under-
standing the system-wide environmental impacts. A cradle-to-grave
LCA study of a product considers all life cycle stages from extraction
or primary production of materials and fuels (‘cradle’) through pro-
duction and use of the product to its final disposal (‘grave’). The
framework has been standardised by the International Organization
as ISO 14,044:2006 [621]. It comprises four key elements:

and the criticism remains that without respecting such a framework,
current land-use “reflects the dietary and transportation preferences
of wealthier individuals” [630]. What is clear from the literature is
that the use of food crops, as opposed to food wastes represents an
area fraught with challenges, which must be resolved on a case-by-
case basis.

tifying opportunities for improvement.

12. Conclusions

PBio-based fuels production has been subject to a large number of
life cycle analyses. A large number of factors come into play when
undertaking such assessments, in particular understanding land use
changes, credits from co-products such as chemicals, heat and power
and the degree of carbon sequestration during the biomass growth
phase [622]. One the main sources of uncertainty in undertaking a
life cycle assessment for biofuels is the concept of indirect land use
change. This arises out of the need to explore what might happen if
a biofuel supply chain increases in scale (cid:1) this change from marginal
to system wide analysis is called consequential life cycle assessment
and is concerned with how land-based activities displaced by biofuel
production will re-establish themselves. Because these analyses
tend to be hypotheses-driven, they do give rise to large uncertainties
and are strongly affected by underlying assumptions [623,624].

PTwo key insights arise from life cycle analyses: the use of agricul-
tural residues or non-food crops leads to lower environmental
impacts than the use of food crops, and the efficiency of conversion
from primary biomass to products should be high because most
environmental impacts are incurred in the production stage and
hence a higher amount of useful product per unit input is critical.
This is where the benefits of effective gasification and downstream
conversion can provide significant benefits by maximising the use of
all the biomass (lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose) directly. A com-
prehensive analysis of gasification for power production was per-
formed by NREL [625], who found that the life cycle CO2 emissions
were very sensitive to assumptions on soil carbon accumulation. A
study of hydrogen production through biomass gasification and con-
version found that the life cycle CO2 emissions were seven times
lower than the incumbent methane steam reforming process and
the life cycle acidification impact around half of the SMR process
[626]. A benefit of the biomass route was the ability of a process to
generate its own power needs from a renewable source.

11.5. Ethical issues

PThere are ethical issues relating to the use of biofuels based on
food crops given a steady population growth, and potential short-
ages of agricultural land due to urbanization, global warming and
other factors. One of the more detailed evaluations of issues relating
to biofuels was provided by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics [627],
which explored whether 9 billion people could be fed equitably,
without putting excessive strains on water use, while adapting to
mitigating climate change based on the consideration that by 2030
the world will need to produce 50% more food and energy, together
with 30% fresh water [628,629]. The overall conclusion of this work
was that any strategy should include protection of human rights, full
life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions, the employment
of fair trading principles and the use of access and benefit-sharing
schemes, but that providing this was done biofuels had a clear role
to play in contributing to energy security, especially for transporta-
tion fuels and that such developments should be supported provid-
ing they met the ethical guidelines laid out in the Nuffield Council of
Bioethics study. A significant issue in such developments is how
high their cost, which will militate against biofuels in favor of
cheaper conventional alternatives [630]. While, there appears to be
general support for the concept that biofuels can make an extremely

PVarious important investigations in the last century and in this
century emphatically reflect the potential of biofuels, especially lig-
nocellulosic biomass-derived biofuels. Second- and third-generation
biofuels are considered better alternatives to petro-derived fuels
when compared to food crop-derived first-generation biofuels on
account of their ability to utilize wastes and other material with low
food supply interactions. Numerous advancements in biomass gasifi-
cation technology have made it a viable route to process diverse bio-
mass feedstock in an efficient and cost-effective manner to generate
syngas. Moreover, the latest developments in syngas clean-up and
processing techniques have enabled its usage as a raw material for
catalytic biofuel generation.

PA sense of concern is required among different governments on
account of the impact of conventional fuels on climate change due to
GHG emissions as well as their contribution to land and water pollu-
tion during their extraction, production and transportation. This
calls for sustainable substitutes which have the potential for climate
change mitigation. In addition, these substitutes should be cost-
effective and should not have an adverse influence on society. Syn-
gas-derived biofuels have the potential to include all these charac-
teristics. However, unavailability of the right technology coupled
with poor planning, ineffective policies and badly-controlled practi-
ces are critical hindrances in the production and usage of biofuels to
a greater extent. These issues should not be allowed to distract us
from taking the necessary steps to exploit the major potential
advantages of biofuels and encourage biomass exploitation more
widely.

PBiofuels can be a vital contributor to curb energy scarcity, espe-
cially by their deployment as transportation fuels. Governments
should provide necessary infrastructure and policies to support their
development provided they meet the ethical guidelines. It should be
noted that the major limitation in such developments is the higher
cost of biofuel production against established fuels.
It can be
emphatically deduced from the previous studies that employing
food crops for biofuels instead of wastes and other biomass as raw
material for biofuel generation is a complex issue and should be
dealt with on an individual basis using sophisticated whole systems
analyses.

PThe challenges should be taken as an encouragement to design
and develop advanced technologies for waste processing to generate
syngas and to employ it for fuel generation. More studies on LCA and
footprint of biofuels combined with systems optimization are
needed to ensure holistic and sustainable implementation in diverse
areas. Furthermore, scale-up of the existing biofuels production
plants should be explored, employing new technologies with favour-
able governmental policies. In this regard, a collaborative effort by
scientists and engineers, environmentalists and policy-makers is
critical to ensure the effective incorporation of biofuels in our society
for an environmentally-friendly and sustainable future.
