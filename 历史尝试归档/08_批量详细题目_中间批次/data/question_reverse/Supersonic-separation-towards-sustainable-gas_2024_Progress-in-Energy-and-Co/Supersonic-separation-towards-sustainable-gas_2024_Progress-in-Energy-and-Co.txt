Carbon capture and storage is recognized as one of the most promising solutions to mitigate climate change.
Compared  to  conventional  separation  technologies,  supersonic  separation  is  considered  a  new  generation  of
technology for gas separation and carbon capture thanks to its advantages of cleaning and efficient processes
which  are  achieved  using  energy  conversion  in  supersonic  flows.  The  supersonic  separation  works  on  two
principles which both occur in supersonic flows: the energy conversion to generate microdroplets and supersonic
swirling flows to remove the generated droplets. This review seeks to offer a detailed examination of the cutting-
edge  technology  for  gas  separation  and  carbon  dioxide  removal  in  the  new-generation  supersonic  separation
technology, which plays a role in carbon capture and storage. The evaluation discusses the design, performance,
financial  feasibility,  and  practical  uses  of  supersonic  separators,  emphasizing  the  most  recent  progress  in  the
industry.  Theoretical  analysis,  experiments,  and  numerical  simulations  are  reviewed  to  examine  in  detail  the
advances in the nucleation and condensation characteristics and the mechanisms of supersonic separation, as
well  as  new  applications  of  this  technology  including  the  liquefaction  of  natural  gas.  We  also  provide  the
perspective of the challenges and opportunities for further development of supersonic separation. This survey
contributes  to  an  improved  understanding  of  sustainable  gas  removal  and  carbon  capture  by  using  the  new-
generation supersonic separation technology to mitigate climate change.

1. Introduction

Due  to  the  need  to  improve  energy  efficiency  and  promote  envi-
ronmental  sustainability,  there  has  been  an  increased  worldwide
emphasis  on  natural  gas  as  a  cleaner  energy  alternative.  Natural  gas,
acknowledged  by  the  European  Union  as  an  eco-friendly  option  with
reduced emissions in comparison to coal and oil, has played a key role in
tackling  the  energy  scarcity  issue.  Nevertheless,  effective  natural  gas
processing  is  still  crucial  for  cutting  emissions  and  securing  the  sus-
tainable  growth  of  the  gas  sector.  Supersonic  separators  (SSs)  have
emerged  as  a  promising  technology  for  gas  purification  and  carbon
capture,  offering  advantages  such  as  cleaner  processing,  simplicity,

reliability,  safety,  and  cost-effectiveness  [1].  These  separators  utilize
converging-diverging nozzles to generate supersonic flows, resulting in
lower temperatures during expansion and subsequent condensation of
impurities [2].

As shown in Fig. 1, a typical supersonic separator comprises a swirl
generator, a supersonic nozzle, and a diffuser [1, 74]. The supersonic
nozzle  induces  low-pressure  and  low-temperature  conditions,  causing
the phase change of CO2  in supersonic flows. The swirl generator gen-
erates strong swirling flows with extensive centrifugal force (>500,000
g), facilitating the removal of droplets from the mixture. Shock waves
are generated by the diffuser to decrease the flow velocity from super-
sonic to subsonic levels, which enhances the utilization of pressure en-
ergy, with a trade-off of some pressure reduction. In the context of CO2

separation in  flue gas containing  N2,  CO2, and  water vapor, the opti-
mized  design  of  a  supersonic  separator  ensures  the  occurrence  of  the
phase change of CO2 and water vapor in supersonic flows, with N2 acting
as the carrier gas [3].

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state
of  multiphase  supersonic  separation  for  natural  gas  purification.  It
highlights  the  key  advances  and  challenges  in  the  field.  The  insights
gained from this review will be of interest to researchers and engineers
working in the energy and combustion science field, as well as stake-
holders in the natural gas industry.

Although the present study may suggest a predominant emphasis on
natural gas cleaning, a technology recently reviewed by Cao and Bian
[5], it’s important to highlight that our current review article has been
meticulously crafted to offer a comprehensive and thorough analysis of
the subject matter. In this review, our efforts extend beyond the parallels
with the work in Ref. [5]. Firstly, we have earnestly endeavoured to
create a comprehensive and exhaustive review that delves into the core
topic.  Our  article  not  only  explores  the  intricacies  of  the  supersonic
separator mechanism in gas purification but also undertakes an in-depth
examination of the broader landscape from technical study to economic

analysis. Secondly, our review encompasses a range of crucial aspects.
Notably, we meticulously assess practical methods centred around gas
purification and carbon dioxide removal, facilitating a comprehensive
comparative analysis. Furthermore, we extend our scrutiny beyond the
realm of mere thermodynamic evaluations. Our review incorporates a
holistic  approach,  incorporating  economic,  environmental,  and  sus-
tainability considerations, thereby painting a more complete picture of
the  subject.  Finally,  our  review  takes  a  stride  towards  innovation  by
exploring the advantages presented by gas liquefaction. We delve into
the  realm  of  gas  liquefaction,  highlighting  the  role  of  the  supersonic
separator  in  this  context.  Our  article  doesn’t  merely  offer  a  cursory
overview;  instead,  it  endeavours  to  comprehensively  compare  and
contrast  the  efficacy  of  the  supersonic  separator  against  alternative
methodologies. In essence, while our article may share commonalities
with the work in Ref. [1], it is meticulously tailored to offer a compre-
hensive  and  distinct  review.  By  not  only  dissecting  the  supersonic
separator mechanism but also providing a comprehensive exploration of
practical methods, economic implications, and advancements like gas
liquefaction, our review stands as a unique and valuable contribution to
the subject matter at hand.

Around  80%  of  the  world’s  energy  demands  are  currently  met  by
power  plants  that  rely  on  fossil  fuels.  Human  actions  have  played  a
major  role  in  boosting  levels  of  greenhouse  gases,  leading  to  a  one-
degree  Celsius  uptick  in  Earth’s  average  temperature  from  preindus-
trial times [6]. It is essential to control CO2 emissions as these gases are
the main cause of worldwide climate change. Carbon capture and stor-
age (CCS) is becoming a popular method for addressing global warming
[7]. The world’s energy scene is changing significantly, with a greater
focus  on  finding  sustainable  and  eco-friendly  energy  options.  The
incorporation of CCS is seen as crucial in strategies to reduce climate
change  because it  serves  as  a  connection  between  conventional  fossil
fuels and sustainable energy options [8].

During the 1900s, the natural gas market saw major expansion and
variety. Besides its usual role as a source of energy, new gas-to-liquid
technology  allows  for  the  creation  of  various  hydrocarbons,  ranging
from  gasoline-like  to  Diesel-like  substances.  At  present,  unprocessed
natural gas is obtained from three different types of wells: oil wells, gas
wells, and condensate wells. Associated gas is the name commonly used
for natural gas extracted from oil wells. This gas has the ability to exist
on its own in the reservoir as free gas or to be mixed into the crude oil as
dissolved gas. On the other hand, non-associated gas comes from wells
that primarily produce gas and condensate without much or any crude
oil. Gas wells normally produce just raw natural gas, whereas conden-
sate  wells  yield  both  free  natural  gas  and  semi-liquid  hydrocarbon
condensates.

Regardless  of  where  it  comes  from,  natural  gas  is  frequently
discovered  in  combination  with  other  hydrocarbons  like  ethane,  pro-
pane,  butane,  and  pentanes  after  being  separated  from  crude  oil.
Moreover,  unprocessed  natural  gas  consists of  a  variety  of  other  sub-
stances  such  as  H2O,  H2S,  CO2,  He,  N2,  among  others.  In  this  blend,
natural  gas  liquids  (NGLs)  have  substantial  worth  as  byproducts  of
processing natural gas. NGLs, which include ethane, propane, butane,
iso-butane, and natural gasoline, are sold individually and have various
uses.  These  objectives  consist  of  improving  oil  recovery  in  oil  wells,
serving as materials for oil refineries or petrochemical plants, and acting
as sources of energy.

In  the  future,  there  are  various  possible  methane  sources,  such  as
landfill gas, biogas, and methane hydrate [9]. Landfill gas is a specific
form of biogas, with biogas typically being defined as gas produced from
organic matter without being combined with additional waste. Certain
areas  currently  use  biogas,  specifically  landfill  gas,  but  there  is  a
considerable opportunity for more growth and use of this resource.

Advancements in technology have made it easier to explore remote
locations, where efforts to meet the rising demand for natural gas are
increasing.  Nevertheless,  the  natural  gas  found  in  these  reservoirs
frequently includes high levels of impurities and heavy hydrocarbons.
The gas that is taken out mainly contains methane, propane, and ethane.
Similar to petroleum, natural gas is a crucial component of the global
hydrocarbon supply. However, natural gas directly obtained from the
wellhead, while rich in methane, is not pure enough for various appli-
cations. To obtain pure methane and high-molecular-weight hydrocar-
bons suitable for diverse uses, a series of purification steps, known as gas
processing or gas refining, are employed. These steps involve the sepa-
ration of different hydrocarbons and fluids from the pure natural gas.

In  addition,  natural  gases  carry  a  certain  concentration  of  water
vapor, which increases with temperature or pressure [10]. The presence
of water and the composition of the gases can lead to the formation of
hydrates at different temperatures and pressures. It is crucial to develop
techniques that minimize hydrate formation in order to ensure smooth
operations and prevent potential issues.

Prior to transportation through gas pipelines, natural gas with im-
purities undergoes a drying and sweetening process. Dehydration is a
crucial step during the gas pipeline gas-up phase to prevent the forma-
tion of hydrates and protect pipelines from fouling and corrosion.

Between  2002  and  2008,  the  Twister  Bio-Engineering  Company
showcased the versatility of separators in applications ranging from gas

dehumidification to hydrocarbon condensation control and H2S elimi-
nation [11]. Building on this legacy, numerous studies have highlighted
the efficacy of supersonic separators (SS) for CO2 capture, dehydration,
and liquefaction [12].

The supersonic separator’s distinctive capability lies in its ability to
achieve  significantly  lower  temperatures  during  expansion.  This  is
courtesy of the adiabatic cooling associated with the Laval nozzle. This
unique feature enhances its effectiveness at extracting impurities from
natural  gas  streams.  The  SS  design  has  been  thoroughly  examined  in
scientific  studies,  delving  into  aspects  such  as  its  structural  design,
implementation  methodologies,  operational  efficiency,  economic
viability, and potential industrial applications.

Supersonic separators stand out in several aspects compared to other
purification  technologies,  such  as  adsorption,  absorption,  cryogenics,
and membranes [13]. Unlike adsorption and absorption methods that
often  require  substantial  facilities,  complex  systems,  and  the  use  of
chemicals  with  adverse  environmental  effects,  supersonic  separators
offer  a  more  streamlined  and  cost-effective  solution.  Due  to  their
compact tube structure and the absence of rotating parts, the design of
supersonic  separators  ensures  stability  and  eliminates  chemical
discharge, making them environmentally friendly [3].

In  summary,  the  comprehensive  advantages  offered  by  supersonic
separators, coupled with their favorable comparison to other purifica-
tion technologies in terms of cost-effectiveness, environmental impact,
and operational flexibility, underscore their prominence as a promising
and preferred technique for natural gas purification. The ongoing sci-
entific exploration of their design and applications further solidifies the
potential of supersonic separation in addressing the evolving needs of
the  natural  gas  industry.  A  summary  of  the  reviewed  literature,
encompassing experimental work and numerical modeling of supersonic
separators, is presented in Table 1.

A comprehensive review of the literature is presented in the subse-
quent chapters, organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the effect of
heavy hydrocarbons, CO2, and other impurities on natural gas quality
and  utilization.  Section  3  presents  a  review  of  the  configuration  and
applications of supersonic separators. First, the type of design and its
capability to separate gases are discussed. Then, its role in supersonic
expansion and condensation is described. This section also includes a
description  of the  mathematical modeling  and simulation details, fol-
lowed by a comparison with traditional separation techniques. Section 4
focuses on the applications of supersonic separation in natural gas pu-
rification.  It  places  particular  emphasis  on  the  dehydration  process,
hydrocarbon and CO2 removal processes, and studies related to natural
gas liquefaction. In Section 5, the economic and environmental impact
of  supersonic  separation  is  discussed.  Lastly,  Section  6  examines  sig-
nificant  challenges  and  modifications  to  gas  purification,  supersonic
separator  simulations,  the  potential  for  further  research  and  develop-
ment, and the implications for the energy and combustion science field.

2. Characterization of natural gas impurities

2.1. Composition of impurities in natural gas

The increased need for natural gas has led to the finding of plentiful
reserves in distant areas, facilitated by advancements in modern tech-
nology.  During  the  extraction  of  natural  gas  from  reservoirs,  it
frequently contains high amounts of pollutants and dense hydrocarbons
[44]. The gas extracted is primarily made up of propane, methane, and
ethane, making up most of the gas composition. Table 2 illustrates that
natural gas is mainly made up of a combination of combustible hydro-
carbons.  Moreover,  natural  gases  may  also  consist  of  nitrogen  (N2),
carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). There might also be
trace quantities of argon, hydrogen, and helium [45].

Prior to being transported for further processing, natural gas with
impurities undergoes a conditioning process, which includes drying and
sweetening. The sweetening process is employed to remove hydrogen

2.2. Effect of heavy hydrocarbons, CO2, and other impurities on natural
gas quality and utilization

more energy per volume than methane, the main constituent of natural
gas. The gas benefits from their presence as it boosts the overall energy
content,  which  is  particularly  useful  for  applications  needing  greater
heating values. Nevertheless, the combustion efficiency of natural gas
can also be impacted by the presence of heavy hydrocarbons and im-
purities. Extra processing or treatment may be needed for these com-
ponents to guarantee thorough combustion and prevent the creation of
dangerous byproducts. In addition, contaminants such as heavy hydro-
carbons  and  CO2  can  decrease  the  heating  value  of  natural  gas.  The
decrease  in  heating  value  can  affect  how  efficiently  appliances  and
equipment that use natural gas for heating function. Hence, the quality
and  usage  of  natural  gas  may  be  impacted  by  the  existence  of  these
impurities, necessitating the implementation of suitable procedures to
enhance its burning effectiveness and heating capacity for different uses.
CO2 and other impurities found in natural gas can lead to corrosion
and harm pipelines during the transportation process. To maintain the
durability  and  lifespan  of  pipeline  infrastructure,  extra  steps  may  be
required  to  eliminate  or  reduce  these  contaminants.  Moreover,  CO2
plays a crucial role as a greenhouse gas in the process of global climate
change. Rising levels of CO2  from human activities are causing worry
about the growing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [46].
The world’s CO2 levels play a direct role in causing climate change and
result  in  increased  global  temperatures  [47].  CO2  in  natural  gas  also
contributes to its overall carbon footprint. Prioritizing efforts to reduce
CO2  emissions  from  natural  gas  is  crucial,  which  can  be  achieved
through  implementing  CCS  or  other  mitigation  technologies.  These
measures are essential in reducing the environmental effects of natural
gas and addressing climate change [48].

Extra processing steps are needed to separate and purify natural gas
due to heavy hydrocarbons and impurities, leading to complexity and
increased  costs  for  upstream  processing  facilities,  ultimately  affecting
operational efficiency and economics. The effect of heavy hydrocarbons,
CO2,  and  other  impurities  on  natural  gas  quality  and  utilization  can
differ  based  on  the  specific  application  and  regulatory  standards.
Continual attempts are being made to improve gas processing methods
and  create  technologies  to  address  these  obstacles  and  enhance  the
overall efficiency and usage of natural gas.

In  emerging  economies,  challenges  like  intermittent  power  distri-
bution and costs still persist despite the increasing reliance on renewable
energy for the future [49,50]. Compared to oil and coal, natural gas (NG)
emits less carbon due to its higher hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio. As a
result, the sector is working towards substituting carbon-powered sys-
tems with updated, eco-friendly options that have a lower carbon foot-
print. Natural gas continues to be a dependable option for energy in the
medium term. Nevertheless, a notable problem emerges with 15(cid:0) 80%
of verified NG reserves containing CO2, requiring creative approaches to
exploration and extraction [51].

2.3. Importance of removing impurities in natural gas for efficient
combustion and energy conversion

Fuel emissions play a crucial role in the offshore oil and gas industry

E. Lakzian et al.

due to the processing and transportation of hydrocarbons on gas and oil
platforms  [52].  The  majority  of  emissions  from  these  platforms  stem
from gas-fired power generation [53]. Kheshgi and Prince [54] as well as
Xu et al. [55], conducted research on the CO2 emissions associated with
ethanol fermentation.

Water  vapor  is  frequently  included  in  natural  gas  streams  due  to
changes  in  temperature  and  pressure.  Corrosion  in  the  presence  of
moisture is expedited by the existence of carbon dioxide and hydrogen
sulfide in natural gas. In addition, hydrates have the potential to reduce
flow capacity and create blockages within pipelines. Having water in a
gas  pipeline  can  cause  slug  flow  and  decrease  efficiency.  Moreover,
particles and dense hydrocarbons can build up on heat transfer surfaces,
reducing their efficiency. This leads to decreased rates of heat transfer
and system performance in general. Cleaning natural gas is essential for
keeping heat transfer surfaces clean, optimizing energy conversion, and
increasing system productivity.

Removing  impurities  from  natural  gas  and  maintaining  affordable
electricity prices presents a major obstacle, particularly in light of the
growing effects of climate change due to emissions such as CO2. Natural
gas  needs  to  go  through  various  processing  steps  to  become  a  dry,
completely  gaseous  fuel  appropriate  for  transportation  and  delivery
through  pipelines.  Yet,  impurities  found  in  natural  gas,  like  solids,
moisture, and corrosive materials, may cause harm to combustion de-
vices like burners, valves, and heat exchangers. By removing these im-
purities  effectively,  the  lifespan  of  equipment  can  be  prolonged,
decreasing maintenance requirements and minimizing downtime.

During  a  standard  natural  gas  processing  procedure,  various  steps
are included such as getting rid of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), dehydrating,
modifying  the  water  dew-point  (WDPA)  with  propane,  adjusting  the
+
hydrocarbon  dew-point  (HCDPA)  with  heavy  hydrocarbons  (C3
),  and
removing carbon dioxide [56]. Sulfur compounds impurities can inter-
rupt combustion by producing sulfur oxides (SOx) in the process. These
substances add to air quality issues and are capable of corroding ma-
chinery.  By  efficiently  eliminating  sulfur  compounds  and  other  con-
taminants, the combustion process can be enhanced, leading to better
combustion efficiency and decreased emissions.

Some impurities, like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and haz-
ardous  air  pollutants  (HAPs),  can  lead  to  air  pollution  and  present
dangers to human health and the environment. Cleaning natural gas by
removing impurities reduces the release of harmful substances, leading
to  more  environmentally  friendly  and  long-lasting  energy  conversion
methods. In certain cases, natural gas is used as a raw material for cat-
alytic  processes  in  industries  like  refineries  or  petrochemical  plants.
Impurities in the gas flow can make catalysts less effective and reduce
process efficiency. Ensuring the protection and longevity of catalysts is
achieved  by  purifying  natural  gas,  which  optimizes  the  conversion
processes.

Through the injection of CO2 into oil fields, CO2 can be removed from
natural gas (NG) as well as used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) [57]. In
a  related  context,  Reis  et  al.  [58]  conducted  optimization  studies  on
membrane permeation to address both bulk CO2  removal and EOR re-
quirements, considering time-dependent CO2  contents to facilitate the
absorption of final polishing chemicals. In a subsequent study, Reis et al.
[59]  further  improved  membrane  permeation  (MP)  by  considering
time-varying  CO2  concentrations  to  overcome  limitations  associated
with  the  exposure  of  bulk  CO2  removal,  thereby  allowing  for  the  ab-
sorption of polishing chemicals. Anwar et al. [60] cited innovative CO2
mitigation approaches such as algal CO2  capture, nanotechnology CO2
capture, and biochar CO2 capture, among others.

In summary, the removal of impurities from natural gas plays a vital
role  in  achieving  efficient  combustion,  safeguarding  equipment,
enhancing  heat  transfer  efficiency,  controlling  emissions,  and  main-
taining  the  effectiveness  of  catalysts.  These  purification  processes
contribute  to  improved  energy  conversion,  reduced  environmental
impact, and enhanced overall system performance.

3. Supersonic separation techniques

3.1. Basic principle and design of supersonic separators

Supersonic separators (SS) are compact devices (as shown in Fig. 1)
equipped with convergent-divergent Laval nozzles and stationary vanes
at the inlet to generate swirls. Their refrigeration effect surpasses that of
expanders,  vortex  tubes,  and  Joule-Thomson  (J-T)  devices  [61].  One
notable advantage of supersonic separators is the prevention of hydrate
formation  due  to  the  short  residence  time,  eliminating  the  need  for
regeneration  and  inhibitors.  This  process  is  environmentally  friendly.
Simulation  studies  of  supersonic  separators  require  a  comprehensive
approach  that  considers  the  formulation  of  the  problem  and  in-
corporates  all  factors  influencing  performance.  Designing  or  under-
standing  the  performance  and  operating  conditions  of  supersonic
separators involves making several decisions. Various variables must be
taken into account, such as the number of phases, the equation of state,
the type of shockwave, the nozzle geometry, and the working fluid se-
lection. A good starting point is to identify the system and delve into the
underlying theories and research methods.

The utilization of a Laval nozzle in the supersonic separator enables
adiabatic cooling, resulting in significantly low temperatures during the
separation phase. This capability enhances the extraction of impurities
[62]. The separation performance and design of supersonic separators
have been extensively investigated through scientific studies.

Microgravity-operated  phase  separators  can  be  classified  into  sta-
tionary and centrifugal types. A static device, without moving parts, is
more  reliable  for  unmanned  operations  on  a  platform  than  one  with
moving parts. Particles are separated by their wetting properties [63].
Despite their short lifespan, static separators offer advantages such as
simplicity, reliability, and low power consumption. However, excessive
moisture can increase the presence of microorganisms, making the de-
vices  more  susceptible  to  malfunctions.  The  hydrophobic-hydrophilic
separator  is  a  static  separator  that  separates  hydrophilic  from  hydro-
phobic materials by exploiting water’s reversible attraction and repul-
sion. However, hydrophobic materials eventually lose their capacity to
repel  and  trap  particles.  On  the  other  hand,  centrifugal  separators
require more power but have a longer operational life. These devices
increase the centrifugal separation of condensed phases by converting
axial velocity into angular velocity [64]. Spinning wings or vanes can be
found either before or after the nozzle’s throat in centrifugal separators.
Supersonic  separators  offer  several  advantages  over  conventional

technologies. Some of these key advantages include.

⁃  Compact  size:  Supersonic  separators  are  relatively  small  in  size,
requiring less space for installation compared to traditional separa-
tors.  This  compactness  makes  them  more  convenient  for  trans-
portation and handling.

⁃  Cost-effective: The installation of supersonic separators is generally
more affordable compared to  larger and  more complex separation
systems. This cost-effectiveness makes them a favorable choice for
various applications.

⁃  Lower  operating  costs:  Supersonic  separators  typically  have  lower
operating  costs  due  to  their  simplified  design  and  lower  energy
consumption. These devices are efficient in separating heavy com-
ponents like C3+ from the natural gas flow, leading to cost savings in
the long run.

⁃ Environmental  friendliness:  The  use  of  supersonic  separators  con-
tributes  to  environmental  sustainability.  These  devices  aid  in  the
removal of impurities and heavy components from the gas stream,
resulting  in  cleaner  and  more  environmentally  friendly  gas  for
utilization.

Overall,  supersonic  separators  provide  benefits  in  terms  of  space
efficiency, transportation, cost-effectiveness, lower operating expenses,
and  environmental  considerations.  These  advantages  make  them  an

attractive option for various industries and applications.

In a study conducted by Shooshtari and Shahsavand [65], the impact
of the diffuser angle on the location of normal shocks, pressure recovery
coefficients, and shock onset positions was investigated. The researchers
found that altering the divergence angle on the Laval nozzle did not have
any effect on the temperature or pressure prior to the occurrence of the
◦
shock. However, by selecting an incline of 8
, they were able to achieve a
pressure recovery coefficient of 0.88 with minimal energy loss. More-
over,  the  optimal  value  for  the  diverging  section  remained  constant
within the range of 290–310 K and 6–10 MPa, regardless of the initial
gas temperature and pressure.

3.2. Converging-diverging nozzle and its role in supersonic expansion and
condensation

A supersonic nozzle serves as a crucial component in the design and
optimization  of supersonic separators, playing a pivotal role in accel-
erating fluid to supersonic velocities by converting pressure and tem-
perature into kinetic energy [66]. Supersonic separators, designed for
the separation of gas and liquid phases in multiphase flows, offer distinct
advantages,  including  reduced  weight,  smaller  size,  heightened  effi-
ciency,  and  lower  maintenance  costs  compared  to  conventional  sepa-
rators [1].

The  design  and  optimization  of  a  supersonic  nozzle  tailored  for
specific  separations  involve  careful  consideration  of  various  factors,
including  inlet  and  outlet  conditions,  fluid  properties,  nozzle  shape,
shock wave structure, and reliability requirements [67]. The selection
and  optimization  of  nozzle  type  and  geometry  play  a  crucial  role  in
achieving  efficient  particle  separation.  Key  details  in  this  process
include:

Converging-Diverging Nozzle (De Laval Nozzle) widely used nozzle
type consists of a converging section followed by a diverging section,
accelerating flow to sonic or supersonic speeds. For subsonic to sonic
flow applications, a simpler converging nozzle may be employed. The
shape of the converging section influences acceleration speed and effi-
ciency, while the diverging section is critical for maintaining supersonic
flow  and  preventing  shock  waves.  Strategies  for  optimization  involve
tailoring  the  nozzle  to  achieve  a  specific  Mach  number  at  the  exit,
controlling  shock  waves,  adjusting  the  divergence  angle,  optimizing
throat dimensions, ensuring uniform flow distribution, and considering
particle  characteristics.  Matching the  nozzle  design  to  the  fluid  prop-
erties, density, and size of particles is essential for efficient separation.
Balancing nozzle dimensions with varying inlet conditions and particle
characteristics is crucial for operational flexibility in separator design.
Achieving  the  desired  Mach  number  and  pressure  ratio  at  the  exit  is
paramount  for  efficient  separation,  while  avoiding  flow  separation,
shock wave boundary layer interaction, and flow instability is essential
for maintaining performance and reliability. The effects of fluid prop-
erties such as compressibility, viscosity, density, and phase change on
flow behavior and separation efficiency must be accounted for in nozzle
design. Moreover, historical contributions to the field by researchers like
Oswatitsch [68] and recent studies by Wyslouzil and colleagues [69,70]
have  further  advanced  the  understanding  of  supersonic  nozzle
principles.

Fig. 2 presents a schematic of a supersonic nozzle where  a vapor-
carrier  gas  mixture  enters  the  nozzle  with  known  temperatures,  total
pressures, and partial pressures of the condensable gas [71]. As the gas
expands  and  cools  through  the  nozzle,  the  supersaturation  ration  (S)
rapidly  increases.  When  the  supersaturation  exceeds  a  critical  value
(Scrit) on a microsecond timescale, phase transition occurs. It has been
observed that when phase transition occurs in a gas mixture, the tem-
peratures  and  pressures  are  higher  compared  to  the  expansion  of  the
same  gas  mixture  without  condensation,  which  can  be  attributed  to
isentropic expansion [72].

A De Laval nozzle is divided into three parts based on its speed: the
subsonic,  sonic,  and  supersonic  sections.  Following  these  sections are

sation phenomenon in a supersonic nozzle [71] (Reprinted from Zhang et al.

the liquid collector and the diffuser. The thermodynamic properties of a
nozzle change along its axial length, making the placement of the nozzle
an important aspect of simulations. However, each design of a nozzle
may  have  a  different  geometry.  The  geometry  of  the  nozzle  is  often
determined by a  series of converging-diverging angles  and equations.
Modeling  nozzles  is  best  done  by  establishing  a  universal  positional
relationship so that it can be applied to nozzles with different geometries
[73].

In the Laval nozzle, condensable species undergo liquefaction due to
the rapid temperature drop that occurs during the expansion of the fluid
to supersonic speeds. The flow characteristics can be described using the
Mach Number (Ma), which is the ratio of the axial flow velocity (v) to the
sound speed property (c) of the multiphase fluid. The flow initially starts
as subsonic (Ma < 1) in the Laval converging section, where the nozzle
cross-section  steadily  decreases.  As  the  flow  approaches  the  nozzle
throat, it reaches sound speed (Ma = 1), and the cross-sectional area of
the  nozzle  is  at  its  minimum.  This  point  is  known  as  the  maximum
constriction. Beyond the throat, the flow rapidly expands in the Laval
diverging section, resulting in an increasing cross-sectional area of the
nozzle. In this section, the flow becomes supersonic (Ma > 1) and ac-
celerates to very high speeds.

The Laval diverging section can experience  an irreversible normal
shock  adiabatic  transition,  which  is  a  metastable  phenomenon,  when
supersonic flow passes through it. In this case, the supersonic flow un-
dergoes  a transformation into  subsonic  flow, leading  to increased  en-
tropy,  pressure, and temperature while maintaining the same energy,
momentum, and mass flow rate. To prevent the loss of separation due to
re-evaporation, it is crucial to collect the Laval condensate upstream of
the shock. Once the shock occurs, the subsonic flow recovers its tem-
perature and pressure and continues through the SS exit.

In the SS process, the removal of the condensate from the supersonic
flow  results  in  an  irreversible  transition  known  as  the  SS  shock.  The
outlet  pressure  is  always  lower  than  the  inlet  pressure,  even  during
isentropic compression or expansion steps. The current state of the art in
SS is represented by thermodynamic SS, as described by de Medeiros
et al. [74], and the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model devel-
oped by Wen et al. [4]. Yang et al. [75] have further expanded on these
studies using the same nozzle design, representing the current state of
the art in the SS literature.

A supersonic swirling separator offers several advantages. It operates
without any dynamic parts, chemical additives, or human intervention
[76].  Additionally,  the  high  flow  velocity  of  the  device  minimizes
fouling or solid deposition, eliminating the need for cryogenic cooling
units. The natural cooling effect in the device allows it to reach tem-
◦
peratures of up to 60
C. Moreover, this apparatus can be used in various
environments, including land, sea, and deep water applications [77].

3.3. Experiments in supersonic separation

There are three general types of research approaches [78]: experi-
mental  setup  methods,  thermodynamic  methods,  and  computational
fluid  dynamics  (CFD).  Many  academic  studies  have  delved  into  these
three topics concerning supersonic separations of natural gas, exploring
experimental  setups,  thermodynamic  aspects,  and  using  CFD  for
modeling. Each approach contributes valuable insights and provides a
comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. In this section, we
critically assess and draw conclusions from experimental results, offer-
ing  a  comprehensive  overview  of  supersonic  separator  research
advancements.

Examining the  impact of reflux channels, drainage structures, and
operational conditions on separation performance, one study found that
using materials with minimal roughness and increasing pressure ratios
improved  the  consistency  between experimental  and  numerical  simu-
lations.  Notably,  reflux  channels  enhanced  flow  fields  and  separation
performance.  Additionally,  innovative  cylindrical  drainage  structures
were identified as effective at mitigating the interaction between shock
waves and boundary layers. This fostered a more balanced temperature
field in the nozzle [79].

Another  study  examined  the  dehydration  performance  of  an  inte-
grated cyclone front supersonic separator. By analyzing the impact of
the  pressure  recovery  coefficient  on  dew  point  depression  and  swirl
strength on mass flow rates, it was concluded that the designed sepa-
rator  demonstrated  high  adaptability  to  variable  mass  flow  rates  and
exhibited  efficient  dehydration  of  natural  gas.  This  aligns  with  the
broader  notion  that  supersonic  separators  excel  at  natural  gas  dehy-
dration and heavy hydrocarbon removal [80].

A  supersonic  separator  with  tilted  blades  at  the  entrance  and  a
swirling stabilizer plus a nozzle was also designed in another study. This
research  supports  the  idea  that  supersonic  separators  are  efficient  at
removing natural gas hydration and heavy hydrocarbons [81].

Investigating the particle paths and separation efficiency of a specific
device, an experimental study employed the discrete particle method.
The  study  highlighted  the  importance  of  a  proposed  annular  nozzle,
achieving a robust rotating flow field conducive to separation efficiency
above 95%. The congruence between numerical and laboratory findings
underscored the accuracy and stability of the discrete particle method in
evaluating dehumidification characteristics [21].

In a comprehensive three-dimensional numerical and experimental
study of air hydrodynamic behavior in supersonic separators, insights
into shockwave locations were revealed. The study demonstrated that
improving dehumidification performance is achievable by manipulating
inlet and outlet parameters, such as increasing inlet pressure, decreasing
inlet temperature, and elevating air humidity [15].

Another study explored water and ethanol vapor condensation using
varying amounts of nitrogen. The investigation delved into the effects of
carrier gas pressure on condensation onset, offering valuable informa-
tion on the role of pressure in condensation processes within supersonic
separators [82].

In a novel approach, an experimental study concluded that cyclone
separator efficiency could be significantly improved by combining spe-
cific  components.  The  optimized  design,  featuring  a  constant  flow
element, a  leaf mill  element, and  a  folding plate  element, achieved a
separation efficiency exceeding 95%. This finding holds significance in
enhancing  the  efficiency  and  applicability  of  gas-liquid  separators,
particularly  under  challenging  small  flow  conditions  [83].  Another

experimental study investigated the homogeneous nucleation of carbon
dioxide  through  ultrasonic  nozzles.  It  explored  nucleation  processes,
particle size distribution, and aerosol number density using a variety of
experimental methods to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental
processes in supersonic separators [25].

A  practical  investigation  of  various  nozzle  geometries  led  to  the
identification of an optimal nozzle shape for particle separation. Several
geometries performed better than others at certain NPRs, including the
triangular shape, while the conical shape performed better at low NPRs.
Based  on  this  research  [84],  practical  guidance  was  provided  for
selecting  nozzle  geometries  that  maximize  particle  separation  and
pressure  recovery.  In  summary,  these  studies  collectively  contribute
valuable  insights  into  supersonic  separators,  spanning  structural  im-
provements,  dehydration  performance,  condensation  processes,  and
nozzle geometries. These findings collectively advance the understand-
ing of supersonic separator technology, offering a foundation for further
innovations in natural gas purification and related applications.

3.4. Comparing of various simulation approaches

In complex systems, such as supersonic separation, where gas mix-
tures are separated at high pressures and speeds, simulation is extremely
useful. However, there are different simulation approaches, each with its
own  advantages  and  disadvantages  [78].  Here  is  a  brief  overview  of
some of the common simulation approaches and their pros and cons:

A thermodynamic model describes the behavior of a system using the
principles of thermodynamics, including temperature, pressure, density,
and composition. The focus of thermodynamic studies is on simplifying
flow  behavior,  nucleation,  and  hydrodynamics  to  accurately  depict
thermodynamics.  As  multiphase  flow  equations  become  increasingly
complex, these  models require  more rigorous  calculations  in order  to
understand  phase  equilibrium.  A  thermodynamic  model  is  relatively
simple and quick to implement, and can provide insight into the ther-
modynamic  feasibility  and  efficiency  of  the  separation  process  [85];
However, thermodynamic models do not account for fluid dynamics and
transport phenomena in the system, such as turbulence, shock waves,
diffusion, and heat transfer. Therefore, thermodynamic models may not
be accurate enough to capture the detailed performance and design of
the  system  [86].  Supersonic  separation  technology  incorporates  the
principles  of  fluid  dynamics,  thermodynamics,  and  aerodynamics  to
achieve a breakthrough gas conditioning process [4]. Supersonic sepa-
ration  technology  incorporates  the  principles  of  fluid  dynamics,  ther-
modynamics,  and  aerodynamics  to  achieve  a  breakthrough  gas
conditioning process [87]. Castier [88] developed a numerical simula-
tion  method  using  the  Peng-Robinson  equations  to  model  supersonic
separators.  This  method  focuses  on  determining  the  thermodynamic
parameters of the diverging-converging nozzle, including the speed of
sound and phase equilibrium conditions for non-ideal multiphase sys-
tems. While this method does not provide detailed two-dimensional or
three-dimensional parameter profiles like CFD models, it yields reliable
shockwave  position,  phase  behavior,  and
results  concerning
one-dimensional characteristics.

A CFD study, on the other hand, focuses on modeling multidimen-
sional  hydrodynamics  more  accurately,  but  often  at  the  expense  of
simplifying thermodynamics. For simulations of the flow and thermal
behavior of the system, numerical methods are used to solve the Navier-
Stokes  equations  and  other  equations  governing  fluid  mechanics  and
heat transfer. The CFD models can provide detailed information about
the spatial and temporal distribution of gas mixture variables, such as
velocity, pressure, temperature, and concentration [43]. Additionally,
CFD models can simulate shock waves, turbulence, chemical reactions,
and phase transitions in the system [89]. Wen et al. [20] utilized nu-
merical simulations to investigate the distribution of parameters such as
static temperature and tangential speed in supersonic separators. They
highlighted  the  significant  non-uniformity  of  radial  distributions  of
dynamic  gas  properties,  which  has  an  impact  on  the  separation

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)1011587

E. Lakzian et al.

efficiency  of  components.  Based  on  the  conservation  of  angular  mo-
mentum, they designed an ultrasonic rotary separator. Their analysis of
the flow fields of natural gas with the presence of a shock wave revealed
that the low temperature, high centrifugal field, and supersonic speed of
the nozzle diffuser effectively separate water and heavy hydrocarbons
from natural gas. The position of the shock wave determines the tem-
perature distribution, which affects the re-evaporation and separation of
liquid droplets. If a shock wave occurs in the separation part, it generates
a high temperature that leads to droplet re-evaporation, hindering the
gas-liquid separation process.

These  studies  highlight  the  importance  of  incorporating  various
factors  such  as  viscous  layer  effects,  condensation  phenomena,  and
vorticity  in  modeling  and  understanding  the  behavior  of  two-phase
flows and the performance of nozzles in supersonic separators. Numer-
ical simulations offer valuable understanding of the intricate dynamics
of such systems, aiding researchers in enhancing performance through
optimized  design  and operation parameters.  The issue  lies in  the fact
that CFD models demand significant computational resources and time
to execute. Moreover, the accuracy of CFD models depends on the nu-
merical  methods,  mesh  resolution,  boundary  conditions,  and  initial
conditions. Therefore, CFD models may not be feasible or reliable for
large-scale or long-term simulations [79].

Hybrid models combine different types of models to create a more
comprehensive  and efficient  simulation of the system. Hybrid models
can simulate the flow and temperature behavior of a system using an in-
depth thermodynamic model and an in-depth computational fluid dy-
namics model, for instance Ref. [90]. By combining strengths and lim-
itations  of  each  model  type,  hybrid  models  can  provide  a  balance
between  accuracy and  computational cost. Developing and validating
hybrid  models,  however,  can  be  more  complex  and  time-consuming,
requiring  a  good  understanding  of  and  integration  of  the  different
types  of  models.  Due  to  this,  hybrid  models  may  not  be  available  or
applicable to all systems and scenarios.

Optimal  modeling  strategies  for  supersonic  separation  depend  on
simulation  objectives  and  constraints.  An  objective  of  evaluating  the
thermodynamic  feasibility and  efficiency of a  separation process may
justify  the  use  of  a  thermodynamic  model.  An  optimal  design  and
operation of the system may be achieved through CFD modeling. Having
both goals in mind may make a hybrid model the best choice. The choice
of  modeling  strategy  is  also  influenced  by  the  model  availability,
computing resources and time, as well as results accuracy and reliability.
Hence, optimal modeling strategies vary from case to case, and various
factors may need to be taken into account.

3.4.1. Computational fluid dynamics simulation for supersonic separation
Over the past two decades, thermodynamics and CFD have been used
extensively  to  study  gas  separation  using  supersonic  nozzles.  CFD
solvers,  however,  are  still  underdeveloped  and  struggle  to  capture
complex  transition  behaviors  and  changes  that  occur  at  supersonic
speeds.  This  is  due  to  variations  in  fluid  density  and  isothermal
compressibility  [91].  These  difficulties  arise  from  variations  in  fluid
density and isothermal compressibility. Despite these challenges, CFD
remains an essential tool, particularly in addressing critical design issues
such as swirling motion and flow vane interaction [78].

3.4.2. Limitations of simplified models in supersonic separators

The application of simplified models and idealized conditions in the
study of supersonic separators provides computational advantages but
introduces several limitations. This discussion highlights key constraints
associated with these models and conditions in the context of supersonic
separators.

The  intricate  high-speed  expansion  and  condensation  processes  in
supersonic separators challenge the adequacy of one-dimensional (1D)
simulations [92]. To address this, researchers turn to two-dimensional
(2D) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations, recognizing that factors
like  separator  geometry,  fluid  properties,  and  operating  conditions

intricately influence subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flows. Simpli-
fied geometries may fail to accurately represent a supersonic separator’s
complexities, leading to inaccurate predictions of flow patterns, shock
wave interactions, and separation behaviors.

Simplified  models  frequently  assume  steady-state  conditions,
neglecting transient effects. While extending one-dimensional models to
include  steady-state  supersonic  separation  with  side  streams,  Castier
[92] explored the influence of additional streams on nozzle dynamics. In
reality, supersonic flows can exhibit unsteady behaviors, challenging the
validity of assuming steady-state conditions. Idealized conditions often
assume  isothermal  behavior,  disregarding  temperature  variations. Su-
personic  flows  typically  involve  significant  temperature  changes,  and
overlooking these effects can lead to inaccuracies, particularly in pre-
dicting shock wave properties.

Supersonic flows can have phase changes, such as vaporization or
condensation, that affect separation dynamics [93,94]. However, some
simplified models and idealized conditions may assume that the flow is
single-phase,  which  means  that  the  flow  consists  of  only  one  phase,
either gas or liquid. This may overlook the multiphase interactions that
occur in the flow. To account for the multiphase interactions, some re-
searchers  use  a  Euler-Euler  model,  which  models  the  gas  and  liquid
phases  as  two  interpenetrating  continua,  or  a  Euler-Lagrange  model,
which models the gas phase as a continuum and the liquid droplets as
discrete particles, as shown in Fig. 3. For example, Matsuo et al. [95]
used  a  2D  Euler-Euler  model  with  viscous  effects  to  simulate  the
behavior of two-phase flows in supersonic separators. They considered
the interaction between the gas and liquid phases and the influence of
viscous  effects.  In  contrast,  some  CFD  studies  use  a  Euler-Lagrange
model to track the behavior of droplets in the system [41]. However,
to  simplify  the  modeling  process  and  reduce  the  computational  cost,
some studies use a simpler working fluid instead of natural gas, which
has multiple components. For example, some CFD studies use pure air,
methane, water, or a combination of these substances as the working
fluid [32,96]. This may limit the applicability of the results to real-world
scenarios.

Simplified  models  often  simplify  or  limit  boundary  conditions,
neglecting the impact of surface roughness, external disturbances, and
inlet conditions. Salikaev and Gunmerov [97] investigated the influence
of intake temperature, pressure, composition, and pressure drop on su-
personic gas separator flow, emphasizing the importance of considering
various factors in boundary conditions. Many simulations assume ideal
gas  behavior,  disregarding  compressibility  effects.  Jassim  et  al.  [28]
studied the impact of actual gas flow and nozzle shape on highly pres-
surized natural gas, highlighting inaccuracies in predicting flow fields
due  to  ideal  gas  assumptions.  The  nozzle  design  was  found  to  affect
shock  wave  locations,  emphasizing  the  need  to  consider  actual  gas
behavior. Simpson and White [98] focused on condensation phenomena
in nozzles but acknowledged that simplified models may not accurately
capture turbulent effects. Neglecting turbulence in supersonic flows can
lead to inaccurate predictions of mixing and separation, emphasizing the
importance of accounting for turbulent behaviors.

In  the  pursuit  of  insights  into  the  behavior  of  multiphase  fluids
within  supersonic  separators,  researchers  must  navigate  the  complex-
ities  involved  in  simulation  studies.  The  decisions  made  in  selecting
working fluids, nozzle geometry, and simulation software are crucial.
Fig. 4 provides a comprehensive illustration, serving as a valuable guide
for  researchers  throughout  the  simulation  process  [86].  Even  though
simplified  models  provide  computational  efficiency,  their  limitations,
such  as  neglecting  realistic  geometry,  steady-state  assumptions,
isothermal  behavior,  single-phase  simplifications,  limited  boundary
conditions, and ideal gas assumptions, highlight the difficulty of accu-
rately  representing  the  complex  dynamics  of  supersonic  separators.
Designing  and  interpreting  simulation  studies  in  the  field  requires
careful consideration of these limitations.

3.4.3. Equation of state

When addressing pressurized gases, the use of ideal gas equations of
state tends to introduce significant calculation errors, escalating up to
500%  compared  to  a  mere  2–3%  at  atmospheric  pressure  [99].  The
deviation of real gas properties from the ideal gas law amplifies expo-
nentially with pressure and temperature, displaying considerable vari-
ability  based  on  gas  compositions.  To  mitigate  this  deviation,  a
correction factor known as the gas compressibility factor is introduced
into the ideal gas equation [100]. Various correlations have been pro-
posed  for  the  gas  compressibility  factor,  expressed  in  terms  of
pseudo-reduced  pressure  or  pseudo-reduced  temperature,  such  as  the
Hankinson-Thomas-Phillips correlation [101] and the Hall-Yarborough
equation  of  state  [102].  In  this  regard,  Arina  [103]  investigated  the
behavior of CO2 as a supercritical fluid in a converging-diverging nozzle
using  the  Redlich-Kwong,  Carnahan-Starling-De  Santis,  and  van  der
Waals equations of state. Their findings suggested that all three equa-
tions  of  state  (EOS)  provided  reasonably  accurate  predictions  of  gas
behavior in the supercritical fluid flow through the nozzle.

The SRKV (Soave-Redlich-Kwong) equation is known for its ability to
account for the non-ideal behavior of real gases under specific condi-
tions  [104].  Additionally,  to  accurately  predict  thermodynamic  prop-
erties of fluids, a real fluid equation of state is essential, especially in
high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, considering factors like
residual thermodynamic  sound speed,  residual enthalpy, and  residual
entropy.  These  additional  factors  play  a  significant  role  in  accurately
predicting the thermodynamic properties of the fluid under study. The
use of cubic equations of state is prevalent for estimating vapor pressure,
partial  vapor  pressure,  and  vapor-liquid  equilibrium,  providing  a
convenient framework for analyzing fluid behavior in different phases,
as follows [28]:

where p, T, V, and R are pressure, temperature, volume, and gas con-

cohesion factor which is a function of the acentric factor (ω), tempera-
ture, and the temperature at the critical point Tc.

To calculate the thermodynamic speed of sound in a multiphase fluid
within supersonic separators, various approaches have been proposed
Nichita et al. [105], Firoozabadi and Pan [106], and Castier [107] have
developed methods considering multiple phases to determine the speed
of sound in complex systems. Secchi et al. [108] introduced a technique

thermodynamic  sound  velocity  in  multicomponent  systems  while
considering interactions between different components. NIST REFPROP
provides  three  equations  of  state  for  gas  mixture  calculations:
GERG-2008 [109], AGA8 [110], and Peng-Robinson [111]. Despite the
availability of these options, the Peng-Robinson equation is deemed less
accurate and not recommended for general use in REFPROP, while the
AGA8 equation is cautioned against, especially in the liquid phase or
near the critical point. NIST REFPROP encourages the use of its default
GERG equations of state, which, although more complex, exhibit lower
uncertainties  than  the  standard  GERG-2008  equations  developed  by
Kunz and Wagner [109].

The GERG-2008 equation of state, an extension of GERG-2004 [112],
covers  21  natural  gas  components,  offering  wide  applicability  across
temperature,  pressure,  and  composition  ranges,  including  gas  phase,
liquid phase, supercritical region, and vapor-liquid equilibrium states.
The GERG-2008 equation of state is valid over a range of 90–450 K and
up to 35 MPa, with an extended range of 60–700 K and up to 70 MPa. It
accurately represents experimental binary and multicomponent data for
gas-phase  and  gas-like  supercritical  densities,  sound  speeds,  and
enthalpy  differences,  making  it  suitable  for  diverse  technical  applica-
tions such as pipeline transport, natural gas storage, liquefied natural
gas processes, and separation processes [99]. Despite its commendable
accuracy,  areas  of  improvement  are  acknowledged,  such  as  limited
available vapor-liquid equilibrium data, particularly for mixtures of CH4
and C4H10  at low temperatures. To utilize the GERG-2008 equation of
state for mixtures, the following mixing rules are employed:

studies  by  Baladao  and  Fernandes  [114]  indicate  superior  results  for
GERG-2008  in  calculating  pressure  and  density  for  various  mixtures,
although it requires a longer computational time due to iterative cal-
culations for the vapor and liquid phases in the vapor-liquid equilibrium
calculation. The GERG-2008 equation of state is expressed in a dimen-
sionless reduced form, incorporating the Helmholtz free energy for the
ideal gas mixture, residual Helmholtz free energy, and binary specific
and generalized departure functions. Mixing rules are applied to adapt
the GERG-2008 equation of state to mixtures, with consideration of the
Michelsen-Kistenmacher syndrome.

3.4.4. Simulation of phase transition in supersonic separator

In  fast-expanding  fluids,  some  regions  reach  saturation  while  the
majority remains unsaturated. Gas condensation is not a simple equi-
librium process [115]. In the flow of natural gas through a supersonic
separator, a non-equilibrium phase transition occurs along with super-
sonic  flow  and  mass  transfer  of  condensing  gases.  After  the  rapid
expansion of natural gas in the Laval nozzle, spontaneous condensation
takes place due to the gas being supersaturated, leading to the formation
of condensation nuclei and subsequent droplet growth.

The process of spontaneous condensation in supersonic settings in-
volves two main stages: nucleation and droplet growth [116,117]. Fig. 5
illustrates  the  operational  approach  employed  in  the  condensation
model [71], providing an overview of the simulation methodology used
in studying this phenomenon.

3.4.5. Supersaturation phenomenon

Supersaturation serves as a measure of how far a fluid’s properties
deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, represented by the saturation
line. When steam flows through a nozzle, a phase change occurs, tran-
sitioning  supercritical  steam  into  subcooled  water  [118].  This  phase
transition  involves  spinodal  decomposition,  producing  dry  steam  and
liquid water from wet steam. It also involves phase separation, taking
place in the unstable region depicted in Fig. 6. Spinodal decomposition
occurs when a fluid enters the spinodal region of a phase diagram. In the
case of wet steam within the metastable zone, between the binodal and
spinodal lines, homogeneous nucleation occurs [119].

This phenomenon involves the formation of small droplets from su-
persaturated  vapor.  This  initiates  the  condensation  process  and  the

method  and  computational  grid  [126].  The  numerical  method  must
adeptly  capture  shock  wave  structures,  boundary  layer  separation,
vortex formation, and droplet dynamics [127].

Employing  advanced  shock-capturing  schemes,  such  as  Weighted
Essentially  Non-Oscillatory  (WENO)  schemes,  can  prove  beneficial.
Additionally,  ensuring  the  computational  grid  is  sufficiently  fine  to
resolve flow features and droplet size distribution is imperative. Vali-
dation of numerical simulations against experimental data is essential
for establishing accuracy and reliability. The type and composition of
the  gas  mixture  represent  a  third  influential  factor.  Different  natural
gases can exert varying effects on fluid flow and thermodynamics. For
instance, the CO2–CH4  mixture may undergo supersonic condensation
and  swirling  separation,  impacting  separation  efficiency  [126].  A
comprehensive understanding necessitates a multi-component simula-
tion to study the concentration effects of different components on flow
and phase change. Experimental validation or simulation refinements in
these areas are essential for advancing the understanding of supersonic
separation processes.

3.4.7. Classical nucleation theory

In  experiments,  the  formation  of  liquid  droplets  has  been  demon-
strated not to occur under saturated conditions during rapid expansion
[124]. Rather, under subcooled conditions, nucleation is induced within
high-speed  flows,  overcoming  the  energy  potential.  The  system  then
returns  to  near  equilibrium  conditions  through  the  spontaneous
condensation of the fluid.

The nucleation-driven condensation is initially preferred, leading to
the creation of the first droplets of the liquid phase [128]. The subse-
quent phase transition is then governed by the growth of supercritical
droplets, or droplets larger than a critical radius, denoted as r*, which
effectively suppresses nucleation, re-establishing equilibrium.

The Wilson line is a characteristic of the condensing vapor highly
dependent  on  the  expansion  rate.  Higher  expansion  rates  result  in  a
deeper  excursion  into  the  metastable  region,  shifting  the  Wilson  line
towards  regions  of  higher  subcooling  [129].  Supersonic  nozzles  are
favorable for studying these phenomena as the rate of expansion and
nucleation  can  be  altered  by  varying  the  length  of  the  orifices  while
maintaining the same pressure ratio.

The thermodynamic non-equilibrium states of gas mixtures can be
induced  by  drastic  changes  in  temperature  and  pressure  [130].  To
restore thermodynamic equilibrium, nucleation within the gas mixture
must  lead  to  the  growth  of  detectable-size  droplets.  The  onset  of
nucleation,  crystallization,  droplet  growth  measurement,  and  deter-
mining the Wilson line or spinodal line can be studied using laser light
transmission and scattering, such as shearing interferometer [131,132].
Spontaneous  nucleation  in  supersonic  nozzle  flow  condensation
heavily relies on supersaturation [133]. Supersaturation determines the
ability of a flow to form new nuclei. When the flow approaches satu-
ration, vapor molecules do not instantly condense due to the presence of
a free energy barrier (the sum of volume and surface free energies, as
depicted  in  Fig.  7).  Instead,  they  continue  to  expand  as  superheated
steam.  However,  at  a  specific  degree  of  supersaturation,  the  critical
radius  is  reached,  causing  a  predetermined  number  of  condensation
nuclei of a certain size to form in the steam [134]. Higher degrees of
supersaturation  lead  to  a  faster  rate  of  nuclei  formation  [135].  The
intrinsic and average kinetic energies of vapor molecules are related to
the likelihood of nucleation occurring. The rate of nucleation formation
can  be  characterized  by  Gibbs  free  energy,  which  has  specific  di-
mensions [136]:

subsequent  phase  transition  from  supercritical  steam  to  subcooled
water.  Measurement  of  this  non-equilibrium  process  poses  significant
challenges, and interpreting metastable thermodynamic properties re-
mains  a  significant  challenge.  It  is  defined  by  Brazhkin  [120]  that
metastable phases are non-equilibrium states of matter with reversible
properties throughout an experiment. Metastable regions on phase di-
agrams,  located  between  the  spinodal  line  and  phase  boundary,  can
have  a  finite  fluctuation  that  can  make  a  solution  unstable.  It  is  this
fluctuation, known as a nucleus, and how much energy is expended in
creating such a nucleus that determines the phase’s metastability. The
theoretical calculations of this energy value show a decrement towards
zero closer to the spinodal line. In the analysis of the macroscopic sys-
tem’s behavior, Kaplun and Meshalkin [121] find no fundamental dif-
ference  between  stable  and  metastable  states,  except  for  a  limited
lifetime in metastable states.

Several  studies have  investigated non-equilibrium condensation  in
high-velocity  flows.  Gyarmathy  [122]  and  Duff  [123]conducted
research on condensation within supersonic nozzles, using water vapor,
nitrogen, and CO2. In these studies, static pressure measurements were
used  to  determine  the  onset  of  condensation.  Condensation  caused  a
pressure  decrease  in  the  converging  section  and  an  increase  in  the
diverging section due to the energy released during condensation. It was
demonstrated by Duff [123] that static pressure measurements in CO2
can be used to detect condensation at 0.1% moisture content. Although
the study lacked experimental data to complement the numerical cal-
culations,  Baltadjiev  et  al.  [124]  suggested  mixed  results  could  be
possible away from the critical point of the gas.

3.4.6. Modeling supersonic condensation shockwaves

The accuracy of predicting water vapor condensation in supersonic
flows  with  shock  waves  is  intricately  tied  to  the  Gas  Spontaneous
Nucleation  Rate  Model  [125].  This  model  dictates  the  rate  of  liquid
droplet  formation  from  the  supersaturated  gas  phase  and  relies  on
thermodynamic state, flow properties, and system geometry. Modifying
this  model  to  better  capture  the  phase  transition  process  has  the  po-
tential  to  significantly  enhance  prediction  accuracy.  Another  pivotal
factor influencing accuracy in simulating shock wave interactions and
phase change processes in supersonic flow is the choice of the numerical

focused on H2O models [144] and Lennard-Jones fluids [145] using MD
simulations,  but  there  is  little  research  on  CO2  nucleation  [38,146].
Understanding  the  nucleation  process  of  CO2  becomes  crucial  for  the
application of supersonic gas separation technology in carbon capture
and storage CCS. With MD simulations, nucleation rates can be calcu-
lated using methods such as average first-pass times or thresholds [5].
Nucleation, however, is a stochastic process. Nucleation rate predictions
require multiple independent MD simulations in order to gain compre-
hensive insights.

Extensive  research  has  been  conducted  on  supersonic  separators,
which  promise  to  remove  CO2  from  natural  gas.  It  remains  unclear,
however, whether classical nucleation theory (CNT) is applicable to CO2
condensation mechanisms in natural gas. Using a CH4/CO2 mixture gas,
recent studies have investigated the condensation characteristics of CO2
in natural gas using CFD and MD simulations [147]. The investigation
uncovered crucial insights into CO2 nucleation and growth pathways at
the molecular scale. A Laval nozzle creates conditions that facilitate CO2
liquefaction  at  low  temperatures.  Condensation  conditions  can  be
optimized by manipulating the inlet temperature and pressure. A MD
simulation of the nucleation stage revealed a complex interaction be-
tween  CO2  gas  molecules,  latent  heat  release,  and  cluster  stability
influenced  by  energy  interactions  with  surrounding  molecules.  The
study revealed a substantial deviation between the CNT results and MD
simulations by orders of magnitude, emphasizing the need for correc-
tions to the classical theory.

In conclusion, molecular simulations, particularly MD simulations,
stand as a cornerstone in unraveling the complexities of non-equilibrium
condensation  in  supersonic  separators  at  the  nanoscale.  Aside  from
providing  a  microscopic  understanding  of  nucleation  processes,  these
simulations also provide a theoretical reference for optimizing the sep-
aration effect of CO2. We will undoubtedly contribute significantly to
the  advancement  of  supersonic  gas  separation  and  its  applications  in
carbon capture and storage, by integrating various findings, correcting
classical theories, and refining simulation techniques.

3.4.9. Droplet growth rate

During  actual  droplet  growth,  a  lot  of  molecules  surround  the
condensation nucleation [148]. As the molecules of vapor condense on
the condensation nuclei’s surfaces, the droplets keep growing [149]. The
vapor molecules release latent heat into the surrounding gas, which is a
normal mechanism for transferring heat and mass. Slip velocity between
vapors and liquids is often ignored since liquid droplets have tiny for-
mation diameters, on the order of nanometers. The Knudsen number is
the ratio of the vapor molecules’ mean free path to the diameter of the
droplet [5]:

Kn =

l
2r

(8)

This  formula  shows  the  interaction  between  droplets  and  vapor
molecules; In Eq. (6) mean free length of vapor molecule (l) is defined as:

l = 1.5μ

√ /
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅

(9)

With  a  modest  value  of  Kn  and  a  large  droplet  diameter,  the
continuous flow model can be used to compute. A high Kn means the
droplet diameter is smaller than the distance between vapor molecules,
so the free molecular flow model can find the flow field.

Condensation  is  thought  to  occur  only  on  the  surface  of  existing
droplets after the nucleation zone. One of the continuous droplet growth
model  was  developed  by  Gyarmathy  to  simulate  homogeneous
condensation  [150].  In  the  model,  heat  and  mass  are  transmitted,
capillary  influence  is  considered,  and  vapor  molecules  are  diffused
through the surrounding media. A droplet’s energy balance is written as
follows [151]:

Fig. 7. Radius of particles and the changes of Gibbs free energy. The figure also
includes  schematic  representations  of  the  nucleation  stages,  showing  the
reversible  states  of  the  embryo  and  cluster  and  the  irreversible  state  of  the
nucleation. After the nuclei phase, the droplets start to grow [137] (Reprinted
from Taqieddin et al. [137], an open access article from IOP Science).

Calculating the maximum free energy relative to the droplet radius
makes it possible to calculate the critical radius in the nucleation process
[138].

r* =

2σr
ρLRTGln(S)

(5)

In this equation, r*  is the cluster’s critical radius. A droplet with a
radius smaller than the critical radius evaporates, while a droplet larger
than the critical radius grows [139]. It is possible to estimate the rate of
condensation  and nucleation of supercooled vapor using the required
radius. Two-phase flows form droplets based on their nucleation rates
under supersaturation conditions. The nucleation rate can be calculated
using the following formula [140]:

I = I0e(cid:0) Gb

(6)

There are various expressions and corrections for I0  and the expo-
nential function in the relation (4). Iclass  is known as a basis for calcu-
lating the rate of classical nucleation (CNT):

3.4.8. MD nucleation simulation

In the realm of supersonic gas separation techniques, unraveling the
intricacies  of  non-equilibrium  condensation,  particularly  in  the  nano-
scale  regime,  is  paramount  for  advancing  our  comprehension  of  pro-
cesses like nucleation and droplet growth. Nucleation, the initial step in
condensation,  is  significant  in  quantifying  the  condensation  process.
This  is  crucial  for  applications  such  as  controlling  CO2  liquefaction
[141].  However,  despite  experimental  efforts,  quantitative  measure-
ment of the nucleation rate of CO2 remains a challenge due to limitations
and discrepancies between experimental results and classical theoretical
predictions [25].

In recent years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged
as a powerful tool to bridge the gap in our understanding of nucleation
processes  [142].  These  simulations  provide  researchers  with  a  micro-
scopic view, allowing them to monitor the evolution of nonequilibrium
dynamics  over  time  [143].  There  has  been  considerable  research

temperature [152]. In many wet steam calculations, due to the smallness

where TS (P) is the saturation temperature corresponding to the vapor

only occurs on the surfaces of existing droplets [153]. Mass and energy
are  exchanged  between  buds  and  their  surroundings,  and  the  buds
absorb  molecules.  A  variety  of  analysts  have  studied  the  droplet  in
growth  rate  so  far.  By  combining  the  two  relations  (8  and  (9),  the
following expression for the growth rate of the droplet is obtained [154]:

In this equation, L is the latent heat of vaporization at the saturation

ronment (steam) and is expressed as the following relationship [155]:

Further details on wet flow equations can be found in Ref. [155].
The application of pressure boundary conditions at the intake and
exit  of  the  supersonic  separator,  along  with  no-slip  and  adiabatic
boundary  conditions  at  the  walls,  is  a  common  practice  in  numerical
simulations of supersonic separation [157]. These boundary conditions
help define the behavior of the fluid and ensure accurate representation
of the system.

3.5. Factors influencing the efficiency of supersonic separators

The effectiveness of supersonic separators hinges on various factors,
including inlet temperature, pressure, flow velocity, and impurity con-
centrations. These parameters impact fluid dynamics, thermodynamics,
phase transitions, and droplet formation.

The separation efficiency of supersonic separators is notably affected
by  the  inlet  temperature.  This  parameter  influences  the  saturation
pressure and temperature of the gas mixture, determining the degree of
supersaturation and the onset of condensation. A higher inlet tempera-
ture can postpone condensation, potentially diminishing separation ef-
ficiency.  The  optimum  inlet  temperature  range  is  contingent  on  gas
mixture  type,  composition,  operating  pressure,  and  separator  design.
Notably,  an  enhanced  supersonic  separator  with  a  diversion  cone  is

recommended to operate within the temperature range of 300–320 K
[158],  although  variations  may  exist  for  different  separators  and  gas
mixtures.

Inlet pressure plays a pivotal role in density and velocity modulation
of the gas mixture, impacting expansion and shock wave formation in
the  nozzle  [159].  Elevated  inlet  pressure  may  amplify  the  expansion
ratio, consequently enhancing separation efficiency. The optimal inlet
pressure range is subject to gas mixture characteristics, operating pres-
sure, and separator design. For an improved supersonic separator with a
diversion cone, the suggested inlet pressure range is 400–600 kPa [158].
However, this range may vary for different types of supersonic separa-
tors and gas mixtures.

Flow  velocity  is  a  critical  parameter  significantly  influencing  the
separation efficiency of supersonic separators. The interaction between
flow velocity, shock waves, expansion fans, and other flow features plays
a decisive role in determining separation efficiency. Research by Liu and
Ding [159] reveals that an increase in inlet port number and gas-liquid
area ratio leads to a decrease in separation efficiency. Senfter et al. [160]
further report that high inlet volume flow rates enhance particle sepa-
ration  but  also  result  in  higher  pressure  drops.  Recordings  indicate
separation efficiencies ranging from 26.92% to 38.56%, accompanied by
pressure drop variations between 0.218 bar and 0.413 bar.

Higher flow velocities in supersonic separators induce stronger shock
waves and increased kinetic energy, potentially optimizing separation
efficiency through efficient phase separation. An optimal range of flow
velocities  is  crucial  for  effective  operation,  dependent  on  separator
design, fluid characteristics, and separation objectives. The interaction
of shock waves with the fluid stream necessitates meticulous design of
critical components such as nozzles and diffusers, directly influencing
overall  separation  efficiency.  Optimization  of  the  overall  geometry,
including diverging and converging sections, is essential to accommo-
date desired flow velocities for efficient separation. Certain supersonic
separators offer adjustable operational ranges to cater to variations in
flow conditions, enabling optimization for specific applications and fluid
characteristics. However, trade-offs may exist between higher flow ve-
locities  and  considerations  such  as  energy  consumption,  equipment
wear, and maintenance, requiring a delicate balance.

Recognizing  that  the  optimal  flow  velocity  range  varies  based  on
specific  design,  intended  application,  and  substance  characteristics,
experimental studies, numerical simulations, and prototype testing are
commonly employed to determine the most effective flow conditions for
a given supersonic separator.

3.6. Comparison with traditional separation techniques

Various techniques can be used to separate impurities. Several fac-
tors need to be taken into account when choosing a specific sweetening
process. These factors encompass: Types of impurities to be eliminated,
such as H2S, and CO2, acid gas concentrations at the inlet and outlet of
the process, gas flow rate, temperature, and pressure parameters, envi-
ronmental considerations and compliance requirements, and evaluation
of relative economics for the chosen process. As shown in Fig. 8, these
techniques include chemical, physical, or hybrid absorption, adsorption,
membrane separation, or a combination thereof [161].

With membrane separation technology [162], gas components are
selectively passed from one end of the membrane to the other. On one
side of the membrane barrier, a large partial pressure of the essential
components maintains a concentration gradient [163]. This novel pro-
cess relies heavily on membrane materials. An appropriate membrane
material should have high permeability and selectivity, along with su-
perior mechanical strength and chemical stability [164].

In  the  scenario  of  high-pressure  natural  gas  (NG),  it  undergoes  a
process where it is introduced into a membrane unit. Within this unit,
water vapor is effectively extracted through the membrane, resulting in
a  dehumidified  gas  remaining  in  the  retentate  [165].  The  permeate,
which  consists  of  the  separated  water  vapor,  is  subsequently

recompressed. After isolating the condensate, it is combined with the
initial gas flow to complete the process. In contrast, when dealing with
low-pressure NG, the gas flow first undergoes compression. Following
compression,  the  condensed  water  is  separated  from  the  gas  using  a
separator. The gas, now free of the condensate, is then introduced into
the membrane block. The permeate obtained from the membrane block
is subsequently mixed with the original gas flow to conclude the process.
A  schematic  of  CO2  removal  from  natural  gas  using  high  pressure
membrane contactors is shown in Figure 9 [166].

The  absorption  technique  relies  on  the  idea  that  different  gases
dissolve  to  different  extents  in  liquids  [167,168].  This  method  could
involve the chemical reaction that takes place during gas purification.
The absorbing material, crucial for absorption processes, must possess
both high absorption capabilities and thermal stability. Using a liquid
desiccant  contactor-regeneration  process  is  a  common  way  of  drying
natural gas in the gas industry. In this method, illustrated in Fig. 10 [30],
the wet gas is exposed to a dry solvent with minimal water content. The
liquid absorbs the water from the gas, leading to a concentrated liquid
stream and a dehydrated gas stream. Before being recycled back to the
first column for water removal from the feed gas, the solvent is regen-
erated  in  a  second  column  [169].  Triethylene  glycol  is  the  most
commonly  used  absorbent  in  the  gas  industry,  followed  by  calcium
chloride,  ethylene  glycol,  diethylene  glycol,  and  tetraethylene  glycol.
Because  of  their  high  hygroscopic  nature,  low  vapor  pressure,  high
boiling  points,  and  low  solubility  in  natural  gas,  glycols  have  been
shown to be the most efficient liquid desiccants currently in use [170].
Because of its excellent ability to lower the dew point, cost-effectiveness,
and reliability in operation, TEG has been widely accepted as the most
economical glycol. Nevertheless, glycol dehydrators experience several
operational problems. Contaminants in glycol solutions can come from
suspended foreign matter, while the formation of decomposition prod-
ucts can occur due to overheating the solutions. The formation of foam
in the solution can also lead to the transfer of liquid. Finally, environ-

efforts  to  minimize  their  impact.  In  addition  to  WDPA,  NG  contains
liquids (NGL) that are typically removed to meet hydrocarbon dew-point
specifications (HCDPA). In the majority of cases, NGL has greater value
as separate products, and cryogenic processing, despite being a costly
alternative, is the preferred method for separating NGL. Hydrocarbon
dew-point  of natural gas is  operationally significant, and  HCDPA is  a
quality criterion for gas sales. The extraction of NGL results in a decrease
in  the  heating value  of  the  gas  product, which  can reduce  its  market
value.  HCDPA  specifications  are  typically  met  by  low-temperature
separation.

Adsorption is a type of mass transfer on solid surfaces [171]. Mo-
lecular attraction or chemical bonding is responsible for the adsorption
gas molecules on porous solid surfaces. Chemical or physical processes
can  be  used,  depending  on  the  surface  forces,  to  achieve  a  very  low
concentration. Activated alumina, silica gel, and a molecular sieve are
common solid adsorbents in the gas industry. The adsorption process of
water  molecules  is  dependent  on  the  gas  pressure  and  temperature,
where higher pressure enhances adsorption, while higher temperature
reduces it. These factors are carefully considered during the design of
process parameters. To ensure continuous operation, a minimum of two
bed systems is employed, with one bed dedicated to gas drying while the
other undergoes regeneration [30]. Regeneration is accomplished using
either  preheated  gas  or  a  portion  of  the  dehydrated  natural  gas,  as
depicted in Fig. 11 [30].

Scientists have shown that supersonic separators are more energy-
efficient than conventional natural gas separators [39]. In comparison
with traditional post-combustion capture technologies, supersonic sep-
aration offers several advantages, including a simple mechanism, simple
equipment design, without moving parts, ease of maintenance, and no
emissions  [42].  Fig.  12  illustrates  the  configuration  of  a  supersonic
dehydration line [61]. A novel supersonic separator has been proven to
be  helpful  in  many  gas  conditioning  applications,  like  dehumidifying
and extracting heavy hydrocarbons from natural gases.

Dew points for water and heavy hydrocarbons need to be corrected
for proper transportation and economics. In addition to their capability
to separate carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas, SS
units offer versatility in various applications such as the production of
liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG),  hydrogen  generation,  biogas  upgrading,
controlling  industrial  emissions,  and  enhancing  processes  in  petro-
chemical  refining.  Refrigeration,  membranes,  adsorption,  and  absorp-
tion are traditional methods for correcting the dew point of water and
hydrocarbons [172]. Processes like these usually cost a lot and require
substantial facilities, including complex systems and plenty of chemicals
with adverse effects on the environment [44]. Natural gas streams can
be purified using supersonic separators by removing a variety of impu-
rities. The lack of moving parts makes it incredibly reliable, up to 99%
[173]. As compared to other conventional separators, the SS can accept
a  single-phase  gas  stream  as  input.  With  adiabatic  expansion,  two  or
more  phases  can  form  when  water  or  heavy  hydrocarbon  species
condense  at  low  temperatures.  After  proper  pressure  recovery,  this
phenomenon can result in the gas and liquid phases separating, and a
single stream of gas will leave the SS unit.

With  its  compact  tube  structure,  the  supersonic  separator  is
extremely  stable,  low  in  space  and  weight,  and  is  composed  of  no
rotating parts. Due to the fact that this type of separator does not require
any chemicals to discharge pollution, it is an environmentally friendly

water  removal  [30]  (Reprinted  from  Netušil  Ditl  [30],  an  open  access  book

device [174].

4. Applications of supersonic separation in natural gas
purification

The  supersonic  separator  comprises  several  key  components,
including the swirling device, de Laval nozzle, cyclonic separator, and
diffuser extension. Natural gas is released from high-pressure, low-ve-
locity reservoirs. Its low temperature and pressure result from expansion
to supersonic speeds in the Laval nozzle, causing the natural gas to drop
below its dew point. Unwanted substances condense into liquid and are
then  separated  by  centrifugation  before  being  collected  in  separate
streams. Droplets of liquid form when water vapor and a heavy hydro-
carbon component combine. The cyclone separates the liquid from the
gas by centrifuging the liquid droplets onto the wall as the gas passes
through the device [47]. After the dry gas’s pressure is restored in the
diffuser,  it  is  sent  down  the  transmission  line  for  further  processing
[175].

The specific heat of the carrier gas plays a pivotal role in influencing
condensation characteristics [32]. Additionally, as intake pressure and
temperature  increase,  condensation  commences  closer  to  the  nozzle
throat,  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  nucleation  rate  and  an  elevation  in
outlet  humidity.  The rotational  gas flow  in  the  separator’s  horizontal
axis is 1/3 slower compared to non-rotating flow [176]. The efficiency of
SS  purification  is  influenced  by  temperature,  pressure,  and  flow  rate,
with lower temperature and higher gas flow Mach numbers inside the 3S
unit leading to increased liquid formation [177].

4.1. Dehydration of natural gas for pipeline transport

Dehydration plays a crucial role in gas processing as it safeguards
pipelines against corrosion and prevents hydrate formation. The water
vapor-carrying capacity of a gas is limited and depends on its temper-
ature and pressure. Hydrates, which can form on free water, have the
potential to  reduce  flow capacity, hinder  transmission efficiency, and
even block transmission lines [86]. Additionally, water in the gas can
lead  to  a  loss  in  heating  value  and  pipeline  corrosion.  When  water
molecules in the vapor phase within the pipeline begin to condense and
aggregate,  methane  hydrate  crystals  form,  causing  the  formation  of
larger  particles  [178].  When  these  particles  come  into  contact  with
natural  gas  containing  H2S  and  CO2,  they  can  cause  corrosion  and
erosion. The dew point temperature of water decreases as the ambient
temperature drops. Gas hydrates have a physical appearance similar to
snow.  Several  variables,  including  composition,  water  content,  tem-
perature, and pressure, influence the crystallization of hydrates and the
associated  issues.  Therefore,  the  development  of  methods  to  prevent
hydrate formation is of utmost importance.

In the gas industry, various techniques are available for gas dehy-
dration, with absorption and direct cooling being the most prominent
methods.  Absorption  involves  the  use of  diethylene  and  glycol  in  the
central section to remove water from the gas. In a study, Netusil et al.
[179] compared three commonly used methods of dehydrating natural
gas: adsorption using solid desiccants, absorption with triethylene gly-
col,  and  condensation.  The  comparisons  were  based  on  energy  re-
quirements and the suitability of the energy source. Under low pressures
(NG from UGS at 13 MPa), the condensation method appeared to be the
most  demanding.  As  the  pressure  decreased  linearly,  its  demand
decreased  to  145  kW  at  13  MPa.  The  results  demonstrated  that
condensation  and  adsorption  both  required  approximately  the  same
amount of energy. The energy demand for condensation decreased with
increasing NG pressure, but with a reducing tendency when NG pressure
was increased from 13 MPa to 16 MPa. Molecular-sieve adsorption and
triethylene-glycol  (TEG)  absorption  are  conventional  methods  for
dehydrating  natural  gas  in  offshore  rigs  [179].  However,  these  tech-
nologies  for  gas  conditioning  and  NGL  extraction  require  significant
infrastructure investment and entail substantial capital and operational

known,  it  is  clear  that  continued  emissions  will  have  severe  conse-
quences. It is essential to pursue short-to medium-term solutions to aid
in recovery while simultaneously developing sustainable strategies for
long-term  benefits  [184].  The  building,  transportation,  and  industry
sectors are the primary sources of global carbon emissions. Fig. 13 de-
picts the energy policy roadmap designed to achieve carbon neutrality
by 2050 [185].

The roadmap includes several key elements: I) Subsidies for renew-
able  energy:  Encouraging  the  adoption  and  utilization  of  renewable
energy  sources  through  financial  incentives  and  support.  II)  Energy
storage and electric vehicles: Promoting the development and deploy-
ment  of  energy  storage  technologies  and  electric  vehicles  to  reduce
reliance on fossil fuel-based energy systems. III) Low-energy buildings:
Implementing measures to construct and retrofit buildings with energy-
efficient  designs  and  technologies,  aiming  to  minimize  energy  con-
sumption and carbon emissions. IV) Low-carbon industries: Encouraging
industries to adopt cleaner and more sustainable practices, technologies,
and processes to reduce their carbon footprint. V) Carbon capture, uti-
lization, and storage: Investing in and implementing technologies that
capture and store carbon dioxide emissions to prevent their release into
the  atmosphere,  and  exploring  ways  to  utilize  captured  carbon  for

costs. They often involve spinning components, require complex human
operations, pose safety concerns, and necessitate regular maintenance
schedules.  Moreover,  traditional  chemical  additives  used  as  hydrate
inhibitors can be environmentally hazardous [180].

A promising high-tech innovation in the field is the use of supersonic
technology  to  develop  target  components  from  natural  gases.  By
employing  a  convergent-divergent  Laval  nozzle,  supersonic  flow  is
generated.  The  supersonic  swirl  separation  technique  is  an  emerging
method for condensing and separating heavy hydrocarbons and water
from  natural  gas.  After  comparing  several  gas  dewatering  methods,
including the ultrasonic nozzle technique with others, it was determined
that  the  ultrasonic  separator  method  stands  out  as  one  of  the  most
effective approaches for dehydrating natural gas due to its distinctive
advantages [181].

4.2. Removal of heavy hydrocarbons for improved combustion efficiency

Parameters  such  as  population  growth,  economic  and  technology
levels, and government policies affect the energy sector in a country. A
sustainable future dpepends on both sustainable energy resources, and
efficient  energy  systems  which  employ  these  resources.  Therefore,
enhancing  the  efficiency  of  energy  systems  is  vital  to  reduce  energy
consumption. For this purpose, it is crucial to understand energy usage
patterns such as the types of energy carriers used, and factors that in-
fluence their usage.

Natural gas contains heavy hydrocarbons that need to be removed to
increase its heat capacity, prevent corrosion of liquefaction equipment,
and avoid crystallization during the liquefaction process [182]. Teixeira
et al. [183] explored a novel approach that utilizes supersonic separators
to  recover  thermodynamic  hydrate  inhibitors  from  raw  NG  while
reducing inhibition losses, as well as performing HCDPA and WDPA on
the gas. Failure to separate heavy hydrocarbons from natural gas results
in increased pipeline flow capacity and major challenges, including the
need for larger pipeline diameters, expanded process facilities, increased
power requirements, and significant cost escalation.

Several  methods  are  available  for  separating  heavy  hydrocarbons,
including refrigeration processes, absorption processes, cryogenic pro-
cesses, surface absorption, membrane separation, and supersonic sepa-
rators.  Among  these  methods,  the  supersonic  separator  has  gained
popularity due to its simplicity, reliability, safety, lower installation and
handling  costs,  minimal  pressure  drop,  and  suitability  for  coastal,
offshore, and underwater operations.

4.3. CO2  capture for reduced emissions

The urgency of the  climate crisis necessitates  immediate action  to
address carbon emissions. While the full extent of the crisis is not yet

various  purposes.  VI)  Carbon  trading:  Establishing  mechanisms  for
trading carbon credits or allowances to incentivize emission reductions
and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

These roadmaps offer recommendations for reaching a carbon-free en-
ergy system and reducing the environmental effects of carbon emissions
[185].

Researchers are currently studying how to reduce human-caused CO2
emissions by capturing, transporting, and storing CO2 [186]. The basic
idea of CCS consists of gathering carbon dioxide mainly from industrial
and  electricity  sources,  compressing  it,  transporting  it  over  extended
distances, and depositing it deep underground for storage [187]. Fig. 14
illustrates  various  low-carbon  emission  options  for  energy  supply,
including natural gas, solar power, wind energy, ocean energy, nuclear
power,  and  waste-to-energy  solutions  [185].  To  ensure  reliable  and
stable energy supply, different types of energy storage systems can be
implemented, such as thermal storage, electrical storage, and hydrogen
storage [188]. Energy distribution serves end-users, such as buildings,
industry, and transportation [189]. Decarbonization roadmaps mainly
concentrate  on  four  main  strategies:  substituting  carbon,  decreasing
carbon, storing carbon, and cycling carbon. The goal of these tactics is to
subtitute high-carbon energy sources with low-carbon options, decrease
carbon  emissions  by  enhancing  efficiency  and  utilizing  cleaner  tech-
nologies, capture or store carbon emissions to avoid their release into
the air, and create sustainable systems for utilizing and recycling carbon.

The  research  on  oxy-combustion,  pre-combustor,  and  post-
combustor  technologies  to  mitigate  carbon  dioxide  emissions  in  en-
ergy production has gained significant attention [190]. The process in-
volves separating CO2 from industrial emissions, compressing it, drying
it,  and  transporting  it  for  geologic  storage  or  enhanced  oil  recovery
(EOR) [191]. Post-combustion capture (PCC) offers the advantage of low
heat consumption, although the solvent regeneration process requires a
substantial amount of energy [192]. However, chemical absorption for
large-scale PCC is not as mature as chemical absorption in other appli-
cations.  Industries  involved  in  chemical  production  and  cogeneration
heavily rely on hydrogen purification and CO2 capture [193]. High de-
mand  for  hydrogen  has  also  led  to  an  increased  supply  of  hydrogen,
which powers gas turbines and fuel cells [194]. Zhu et al. [195] have
highlighted  recent  advancements  in  the  purification  of  hydrogen-rich
gases in their research.

A  combination  of  H2,  CO2,  CH4,  CO,  H2O,  and  hydrocarbons  is
created  from  syngas  by  first  producing  it  by  coal  gasification  or
reforming of steam methane [81]. In offshore rigs, chemical, membrane,

and physical absorption are the main methods used to conventionally
extract CO2 from NG [196].

The use of SS for CO2 collection from NG with high CO2 content has
been  extensively  studied.  Preparing  NG  with  water  dew-point  adjust-
ment (WDPA) and heavy hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment (HCDPA)
is necessary to prevent water C3+ condensation, while CO2  condensa-
tion requires lower temperatures. Monitoring CO2 freeze-out is crucial to
avoid SS blockage. The flow path of the SS for CO2 must adhere to the
solid-vapor-liquid equilibrium freeze-out barrier [74]. Sun et al. [197]
proposed a model for nucleation and droplet growth of CO2  condensa-
tion from a CH4–CO2 feed under high pressure.

Jiang et al. [35,198] have recently employed a separator that sepa-
rates carbon dioxide from NG. Based on the mechanism of droplet and
gas separation, they investigated condensation parameters. In addition,
they investigated the effects of carbon dioxide percentages, input pres-
sure, and intake temperature.

4.4. Natural gas liquefaction for easier transport and storage

Natural gas liquefaction plays a vital role in facilitating the transport
and storage of natural gas by converting it into liquefied natural gas.
Recovering  cold energy from LNG  can significantly reduce  the  refrig-
eration requirements and save energy [199]. In addition to its capabil-
ities in separating carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas,
SS units can also be used to generate LNG. Fig. 15 illustrates a compact
gas liquefaction process, where the natural gas is pre-cooled using a heat
exchanger to lower its temperature [2]. The cooled natural gas is then
directed into a Laval nozzle, where it undergoes a rapid transformation
into a liquid state. The combination of high velocity and low tempera-
ture in the Laval nozzle facilitates this transformation [2].

After passing through the Laval nozzle, the gas-liquid mixture moves
into a gas-liquid separator. In this separator, the liquids separate from
the gas and are directed towards the LNG storage tank. The separated
liquids, now in the form LNG, are stored in the LNG storage tank for
further use or distribution. At the same time, the low-temperature nat-
ural  gas  from  the  separator  is  combined  with  the  boil-off  gas  (BOG)
generated by the LNG storage tank. BOG is the gas that evaporates from
the  LNG  due  to  heat  gain  or  other  factors.  The  mixture  of  low-
temperature  natural  gas  and  BOG  is  then  passed  through  a  heat
exchanger. In the heat exchanger, the incoming natural gas is warmed

using the heat energy from the low-temperature gas mixture. This pro-
cess improves energy efficiency by utilizing the heat from the BOG and
low-temperature gas.

◦

For transporting LNG on ships to receiving terminals, the required
C
temperature  and  atmospheric  pressure  are  typically  around  110
[200]. The liquefaction of natural gas requires approximately 500 kW/h
◦
of electric energy per ton of LNG at 161
C, which includes a substantial
amount of cold energy [201]. Energy requirements for the liquefaction
of natural gas range between 0.45 and 0.55 kWh/kg [202]. Due to the
strong  relationship  between  these  parameters,  enhancing  the  perfor-
mance of the liquefaction process is both difficult and constrained. After
being distilled to make liquefied gas, LNG is kept in insulated tanks. The
liquid is subsequently compressed to the required pressure for pipeline
transit and evaporated to ambient temperature [203].

Bian et al. [35] proposed a revolutionary technique for liquefying
gases, specifically natural gas. In their process, natural gas is pre-cooled
in a heat exchanger and then passed through a Laval nozzle, where it
undergoes  liquefaction  at  high  velocity  and  low  temperature.  The
gas-liquid  mixture  is  then  directed  to  a  gas-liquid  separator,  and  the
liquid  component  is  stored  in  an  LNG  storage  tank.  The  gas-liquid
separator  also  combines  low-temperature  natural  gas  from  the  LNG
storage tank with boil-off gas before entering the heat exchanger.

Gas liquefaction requires the separation of impurities such as nitro-
gen, mercury, moisture, acid gases, and heavy hydrocarbons. Liquefac-
tion is a physical process of converting natural gas into a liquid state by
condensation phenomenon [204]. Liquefaction of gases is used for sci-
entific, industrial, and commercial purposes, and its volume is 600 times
less than natural gas under normal conditions.

LNG  is  the  cleanest  fossil  fuel  economically  and  environmentally
preferable to liquid fuels such as diesel, fuel oil, and fuel oil in many
countries. This product is much safer compared to Compressed Natural
Gas (CNG) due to the maintenance conditions (low operating pressure).
The pressure or temperature can be increased or decreased to liquefy
many  gases.  Nowadays,  to  facilitate  the  storage  of  NG  and  its  trans-
portation, they often use the process of liquefaction of natural gas and
converting  it  into  LPG  and  LNG  [205].  A  supersonic  separator  is  an
efficient tool for producing liquefied natural gas at the lowest possible
cost. Converging-diverging nozzles in these separators cause the flow to
become  supersonic,  causing  the  temperature  to  drop  drastically  and
finally condensation to occur.

4.5. Impurities removal for improved energy conversion efficiency

Natural gas  separation has other advantages, aside from purifying
and reducing emissions. Although fossil fuels will eventually be replaced
by  renewable  energy  sources  [206],  there  has  been  a  relatively  low
adoption rate of renewable and emission-reducing technologies [207],
but achieving the Paris Agreement’s greenhouse gas mitigation targets
requires these technologies. Due to its low levels of emissions, NG has
received the most attention due to its role in making energy sustainable
[208]. CCS and CO2  capture and utilization (CCU) are important tech-
nologies for minimizing environmental impacts. The CCU also converts
CO2 into fuels and chemicals, contributing to carbon recycling [209].

There are a number of industries that could benefit from separated
CO2  [210].The  most  popular  method  is  to  convert  CO2  directly  into
methanol and indirectly through bi-reformation [211]. Upon reaction
between  CO2  and  methane,  syngas  is  produced  which  is  further  con-
verted into methanol by water gas shift reactions. Using carbon dioxide
as a raw material in chemical processes is the main driving force behind
these alternative methanol syntheses [212]. Being the main raw mate-
rial  for  chemical  industries,  methanol  operates  on  a  global  demand
market. Aside from reducing oil dependency, methanol can also serve as
an alternative source of fuel or raw material to manufacture hydrocar-
bons [213]. This could reduce industrial dependence on natural gas and
crude oil [214].

5. Economic and environmental impact

The  supersonic  separator  technology  surpasses  the  limitations  of
traditional technologies. They do not need external power to operate,
which makes them a more environmentally friendly choice compared to
other  technologies.  Separators,  too,  lack  moving  components,making
them more dependable and durable. In addition to being non-leaking
and  non-polluting,  separators  have  a  minimal  ecological  footprint,
making them a favored option for industries focusing on sustainability.
Separators are also safer to handle because they do not need chemicals
to function. This is particularly crucial for sectors with rigorous safety
requirements. Separators make dehydration easier due to their uncom-
plicated  structure  lacking retaining  components. Hence,  it  boasts  low
operational  expenses  and  the  ability  to  function  without  supervision,
making it highly beneficial for sectors needing constant operation [215].
Figure  16  contrasts  the  sustainability  of  supersonic  separation  and
in  processing  engineering,  examining
conventional  technologies
four-dimensional  indicators:  environmental  impact,  efficiency,  health
and  safety,  and  economic  viability  [216].  The  findings  indicate  that
supersonic  separation  outperforms  conventional  methods  in  terms  of
environmental  friendliness,  efficiency,  and  economic  benefits.  Specif-
ically,  the  Sustainable  Plant-Wide  Index  for  supersonic  separation  is
0.99, significantly higher than the conventional route’s 0.86. This un-
derscores  the  superior  sustainability  of  supersonic  separation  over
conventional technologies.

5.1. Cost analysis of supersonic separation compared to other techniques

High-purity gases find widespread application in diverse industries
such as pharmaceuticals, analytics, electronics, and petrochemicals. The
imperative to increase yields, reduce costs, and optimize performance in
these  sectors  underscores  the  necessity  for  process-specialty  gases
devoid of trace impurities [217].

CCS  stands  out  as  a  pivotal  eco-friendly  technology  essential  for
minimizing  economically  feasible  CO2  emissions  from  power  plants
[218]. Despite recent validation of full-scale amine-based CO2  capture
systems [219], the persistent hurdle of costly CO2  emission reductions
has  spurred  the exploration  of innovative technologies  [220]. Among
these  technologies  are  molten  carbonate  fuel  cells  (MCFCs)  [221],
membranes  [222],  pressured  combustion  capture  [223],  supersonic
separator [147], and flow-driven anti-sublimation.

As observed by AlNouss et al. [224], the simplest HCDPA alternative
is  Joule-Thomson  expansion  (JTE)  comprising  heat  exchanger,  isen-
thalpic valve, and vessel for natural gas liquids extraction. These authors
economically/environmentally assessed more complex HCDPA systems
considering  six  turboexpander  configurations  for  lower  power  con-
sumption  and  CO2  emissions,  not  surprisingly
identifying  an
economic-environmental trade-off. The complexity of implementing and
operating supersonic separation technology should be considered in the
cost analysis. Other techniques may have different complexities, which
can impact installation, training, and ongoing operational requirements.
Teixeira  et  al.  [52]  showed  that  SS-methanol-recovery  entails  an
economic  leverage  that  affords  a  post-capture  plant  abating  43%  of
emitted  CO2;  i.e.,  such  SS  processing  is  a  cleaner  gas  production
compared to the conventional counterpart. For safe transportation and
to preserve the heating value of natural gas streams, dew point correc-
tions  of  water  and  heavy  hydrocarbons  are  essential.  A  supersonic
separator can achieve both tasks with a high degree of reliability, min-
imal  operating  costs,  and  minimal  requirements  for  operational  facil-
ities.  The  ability  of  supersonic  separation  to  handle  a  wide  range  of
impurities  and  operating  conditions  can  be  advantageous  in  certain
applications.  Flexibility  in  adapting  to  varying  feed  gas  compositions
and  impurity  levels  may  offer  cost  benefits  compared to  other  purifi-
cation techniques that are more specialized.

Comparing  the  SS  process  with  a  conventional  sequence  of  oper-
ations—WDPA  through  water  absorption  by  triethylene  glycol  (TEG)
followed  by  HCDPA  with  Joule–Thomson  (JT)  and  low-temperature
separator  (LTS)—revealed  nuanced  findings  [169].  The  SS  process
exhibited  higher  capital  expenditure  (CAPEX)  when  compared  to  the
TEG + JT/LTS process.

Further  results  dedicated  that  the  operational  expenses  (OPEX)
slightly favored the conventional process due to its superior availability,
resulting in higher annual natural gas (NG) supply costs [169]. How-
ever, the SS process outperformed the TEG + JT/LTS process in terms of
revenues owing to its higher availability and superior natural gas liquid
(NGL) recovery, thereby enhancing overall economic performance. The
net present value (NPV) of the SS process surpassed that of the TEG +
JT/LTS process. Fig. 17 provides a comparison of fixed capital invest-
ment and discounted cumulative cash flow between conventional and
supersonic separation gas plants. The findings reveal that while super-
sonic  separation  entails  higher  fixed  capital  investment  compared  to
conventional routes, it delivers superior economic performance in terms
of discounted cumulative cash flow compared to conventional gas plants
[225].

Fig.  18  shows  the  incremental  cumulative  discounted  cash  flow
(MMUSD)  for  the  SS  process,  displayed  incrementally  relative  to  the
conventional process (TEG + JT/LTS), reflected the higher CAPEX of the

SS  process  primarily  attributed  to  required  compression  [77].  This
compression, in turn, offered an additional benefit of export gas pressure
12.5  bar  higher  than  the  counterpart  of  the  TEG  + JT/LTS  case.
Furthermore,  the  SS  process  augmented  NGL  production,  leading  to
increased revenues, early payback of the investment, and a higher NPV.
A crucial aspect in investment considerations is depreciation, and the
demonstrated  99%  uptime  of  supersonic  separators  over  six  years,
coupled with near-zero maintenance costs and inspections once every

six years, positions this technology as having lower opportunity costs
compared to traditional TEG + JT/LTS technology. The glycol regen-
eration process in traditional methods, involving the release of a strip-
ping gas to the atmosphere after flaring, contrasts with the SS process,
which reduces major equipment requirements in NG dew-pointing and
eliminates the need for chemicals. Notably, the stripping gas in tradi-

and equipment and lessen any negative effects on the environment. The
first  implication,  which  is  obviously  relevant  to  sustainable  develop-
ment, has been and is still the topic of much debate. Secondly, energy
efficiency  plays  a  critical  role  in  sustainable  development,  yet  is  less
widely recognized and comprehended.

Rising energy consumption puts a burden on existing infrastructures
and negatively impacts the environment via emissions of carbon mon-
oxide, CO2, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur monoxide. Sustainable develop-
ment  is  a  long-term  strategy  for  solving  current  environmental
challenges.

Until 2050, natural gas is expected to grow by 1.1% per year, while
petroleum-based liquid fuels, the most widely used source of energy, are
expected to decline. NG’s competitiveness is supported by its enormous
resources and growing production, including NG hydrate [228], which
is still in its infancy. Additionally, among fossil fuels, natural gas emits
the least carbon dioxide (CO2) per unit of energy produced, which re-
sults in a cleaner burning process. NG is a crucial energy source for the
world, and it is expected to continue playing a significant role in this
century.  Yet,  extraction  and  production  of  NG  can  be  challenging,
particularly in new remote offshore fields. These fields are often char-
acterized by low-efficiency power generation via gas-fired turbines that
emit  hot  flue  gas,  resulting  in  high  resource  depletion,  high  carbon
emissions, and low sustainability. To increase NG exploration and pro-
duction efficiency, it is imperative to find solutions to these challenges
[229]. This is essential because oil-and-gas offshore rigs have a major
effect on the environment, producing CO2  and CH4  via on-site power
generation,  flare  systems,  and  processing  facilities.  In  addition,  these
consequences  are  significantly  more  significant  under  platform
end-of-life  situations  [230].  Offshore  oil  rigs  have  a  significant  envi-
ronmental  impact  due  to  generators,  flares,  and  handling  facilities
on-site that produce CH4 and CO2. In order to meet the rising demand for
natural gas and global sustainability requirements [40], new offshore
processing designs are needed to maximize resource utilization.

5.3. Environmental impact of supersonic separation and natural gas
utilization

Sustainable development depends on taking environmental factors
into  account.  Continuous environmental  harm  is  not sustainable  over
time for a variety of reasons, including the cumulative impact of such
actions  on the  ecosystem, which  over  time may  result  in a  variety  of
health, ecological, and other difficulties. The quantity of energy used by
a civilization has a tremendous impact on the environment. A society
aiming  for  sustainable  development  would  ideally  only  use  energy
sources  that  have  no  impact  on  the  environment.  Efforts  to  improve
energy efficiency may alleviate some (but not all) of the concerns about
restrictions  on  sustainable  growth  due  to  environmental  emissions.
There  is  an  obvious  connection  between  energy  efficiency  and  the
environment since reduced resource use and pollution often occur with
greater energy efficiency for the same services or commodities. Higher
energy  efficiency  reduces  energy  losses.  With  the  bulk  of  efficiency
gains,  the  environment  benefits  in  two  ways.  Pollutant  emissions  are
reduced first by reducing the amount of energy needed for each unit of
manufacturing. When the whole lifetime of energy resources and tech-
nology is taken into account, it becomes clear that enhanced efficiency
decreases the environmental impact at the majority of life cycle stages.
The mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) has been a major
concern in the past few decades, and both chemical and physical solu-
tions have been developed. However, these solutions typically impose a
significant economic cost on emitting processes. It is possible to solve
this problem by converting CO2  into valuable products, such as poly-
mers,  methanol,  and  chemical  commodities.  In  addition  to  reducing
emissions, the project will be economically beneficial as well.

While natural gas plays a different role since it can both be used as a
mode  for  reducing  carbon  emissions  and  a  replacement  target  for
cleaner alternatives, depending on the sector, strategy, and operation

CO2  emissions  due  to  flaring  and  poses  risks  in  case  of  incomplete
flaring.

In summary, the comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of supersonic
separation  compared  to  conventional  methods  reveals  a  multifaceted
landscape. While initial costs may be higher, the long-term economic
advantages, operational efficiency, and environmental benefits position
supersonic  separators  as  a  viable  and  sustainable  solution  across  a
spectrum of industrial applications.

5.2. Energy consumption and sustainability considerations

There are several definitions of sustainable development, but one of
the most commonly accepted is: development that satisfies current de-
mands without jeopardizing the demands of the future [226]. Although
though  the  future  of  sustainable  energy  relies  on  alternative  energy
sources, challenges remain, such as intermittent, location, transmission,
and pricing concerns, particularly in developing nations. As evidenced
by the substitution of fossil-fuels with a low H/C (heat-to-carbon) ratio
(such as oil and coal) with natural gas that has a higher H/C ratio and
emits  less  carbon  dioxide  per  unit  of  energy  produced,  there  is  an
industry-wide effort to replace carbon-fired power plants with efficient
alternatives that leave a smaller carbon imprint. Hence, natural gas is a
safe option for medium-term energy solutions. Nevertheless, more than
10% of confirmed NG deposits include 15–80% mol CO2, posing prob-

and

the

of

Most  people  agree  that  a  stable  supply  of  energy  resources  is  a
necessary  but  inadequate  precondition  to  civilization’s  development.
Moreover,  a  reliable  supply  of  energy  resources  is  necessary  for  sus-
tainable development. Depending on how sustainability is defined, these
statements  have  several  effects.  These  assertions  have  an  essential
meaning, which is that society cannot grow sustainably without an en-
ergy supply that is easily accessible, affordable, and capable of being
used for all activities without having a detrimental influence on society.
The utilization of energy resources as efficiently as possible is necessary
for  sustainable  development,  which  is  the  second  implication  of  the
opening sentence in this section [227]. In this way, society makes the
most of the advantages of using its energy resources while avoiding the
drawbacks (including environmental harm) related to their usage. Thus,
more efficient use of these resources allows them to contribute to sus-
tainable development over a longer period of time. This conclusion ac-
knowledges  that  all  energy  supplies  are  limited  to  some  extent.  It  is
likely  that  efforts  to  increase  energy  efficiency  will  continue  even  if
energy sources eventually become affordable and widely available. This
is because doing so will reduce the number of resources (such as energy
and materials) needed to build and maintain energy harvesting systems

dynamics being analyzed. In a sustainable energy economy, natural gas
infrastructure  will  likely  play  a  less  prominent  role,  despite  the
consensus that moving away from coal and petroleum is essential (or
implementing  additional  measures  such  as  CCS).  The  combustion  of
natural  gas  releases  pollutants  and  greenhouse  gases  (GHG),  while
natural  gas  itself  emits  GHG,  primarily  methane.  The  shift  towards
natural gas as a primary fuel source is becoming increasingly popular
among  industrialized nations. This is  due to  the concern for all  three
kinds of consequences, including environmental, economic, and social
impacts. Recent increases in gas production have been accompanied by
declines  in  total  domestic  GHG emissions,  indicating  that natural  gas
may be a cleaner and more efficient alternative to conventional fuels
(like petroleum or coal). As a consequence, natural gas has been pushed
as a "bridge" fuel to reduce carbon emissions, particularly as a cheaper
alternative  to  coal  for  power  generation  [231].  A  well-established  &
low-cost source of energy, natural gas can be applied to a wide range of
industries
transportation,  and
manufacturing.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  natural  gas
extracted from reservoirs contains high amounts of contaminants and
heavy hydrocarbons. This means that the majority of the extracted gas is
composed of these materials. It has been argued that natural gas should
not be used as a bridge fuel, attributing the concerns that it may impede
the  development  of  advanced,  "terminal"  technologies  or  pose  an  un-
acceptable  environmental  risk  if  it  is  sourced  from  unconventional
sources [232].

including  electricity  generation,

Natural gas is a cleaner and more efficient fuel source than oil and
coal. However, it still contains contaminants and hydrocarbons that can
cause  issues  when  used  as  fuel.  Fortunately,  technologies  have  been
developed to remove these contaminants and hydrocarbons from natu-
ral gas before fuel use. This process is known as gas processing and in-
volves several stages such as separation, dehydration, sweetening, and
fractionation. Overall, the shift towards natural gas as a primary fuel
source is a positive step towards reducing fossil fuel negative impacts on
the environment and human health. However, it is crucial to ensure that
proper  gas processing techniques are  employed to minimize  contami-
nants and hydrocarbons in the gas. Supersonic separation in gas puri-
fication  and  the  utilization  of  natural  gas  can  have  several
environmental impacts. Some key considerations are as follows.

1)  Reduced Emissions: Supersonic separation helps remove impurities
from natural gas, including particulate matter, liquid droplets, and
potentially harmful substances. By purifying the gas stream, super-
sonic  separation  reduces  the  emissions  of  pollutants  during  com-
bustion  or  utilization  processes.  This  contributes  to  improved  air
quality and reduces the environmental impact associated with gas
utilization.

2)  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions:  Natural  gas,  primarily  composed  of
methane,  is  a  cleaner-burning  fossil  fuel  compared  to  coal  or  oil.
When natural gas is efficiently utilized and its impurities are effec-
tively  removed  through  processes  like  supersonic  separation,  the
resulting combustion or utilization processes emit fewer greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). This can help
mitigate climate change impacts.

3)  Air Quality Improvement: Supersonic separation plays a crucial role
in improving the quality of natural gas utilized for energy produc-
tion.  By  removing  impurities,  it  reduces  the  emission  of  harmful
pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and
volatile  organic  compounds  (VOCs).  This  leads  to  improved  air
quality,  reduced  smog  formation,  and  decreased  negative  health
impacts.

4)  Reduced Environmental Contamination: Natural gas extracted from
the wellhead may contain impurities like heavy hydrocarbons, sulfur
compounds,  and  other  contaminants  that  can  contaminate  the
environment if released. Supersonic separation aids in the removal of
these  impurities,  reducing  the  potential  for  soil,  water,  and
ecosystem contamination during gas processing and utilization.

5)  Conservation  of  Natural  Resources:  Efficient  utilization  of  natural
gas, facilitated by supersonic separation, contributes to the conser-
vation  of  natural  resources.  By  extracting  the  maximum  energy
content from purified natural gas, less gas is wasted or lost during the
utilization process. This maximizes the energy value obtained from
each unit of natural gas extracted and reduces the need for additional
resource extraction.

6)  Water  Resource  Conservation:  Supersonic  separation  reduces  the
water  content  in  natural  gas  by  removing  water  vapor  and  liquid
droplets. This can help conserve water resources by minimizing the
water needed for gas processing and reducing the potential for water
contamination during gas utilization.

6. Conclusion and future perspectives

Supersonic separation in gas purification and the utilization of nat-
ural  gas  offers  several  important  benefits  and  considerations  for  the
environment. By effectively removing impurities from natural gas, su-
personic  separation  helps  reduce  emissions,  improve  air  quality,  and
minimize environmental contamination. The utilization of natural gas,
when  combined  with  efficient  purification  techniques,  contributes  to
reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  conservation  of  natural
resources.

Because of the impressive results this technology provides, several
studies  have  been  conducted  at  designing,  functionality,  economic
viability, as well as industrial uses of supersonic separators. However, it
is essential to acknowledge that continued efforts are needed to further
optimize  these  processes  and  address  environmental  challenges.  This
paper, which is an evaluation of the literature, gives a concise overview
of recent developments in the field of supersonic separation technology.
It identifies potential directions for further research.

6.1. Summary of advances and limitations in supersonic separation for
natural gas purification

In general, the purification procedure include removing water, oil,
and chemicals (e.g. hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, and mercury)
from a substance [233]. Conventional techniques for natural gas con-
ditioning and NGL extraction include facilities with high capital costs
and high operating expenses. The design and operation of these facilities
are heavily influenced by the characteristics of wells and natural gas.
Conventional sweetening and dehydration systems feature rotary com-
ponents,  need  complicated  human  operations,  safety  concerns,  and
regular  maintenance  schedules,  and  create  off-specification  gas  upon
startup.  Traditional  chemical  additions,  such  as  hydrate  inhibitors,
represent significant environmental risks. Using a contactor and regen-
erator  equipped  with  a  hygroscopic  liquid  desiccant  is  a  standard
method of dehydrating gases. SS is a revolutionary separation technique.
It  is  based  on  a  theoretical design  that  combines  aerodynamics, ther-
modynamics, physical separation, and fluid dynamics in a novel way,
resulting in a new gas conditioning process.

Supersonic  separator  is  a  relatively  new  technique  that  has  lately
found prominence in the dehydration of natural gas. The process com-
bines  condensation  and  separation  into  a  single  device  that  controls
water and dew point of hydrocarbons while improving Natural Gas to
Liquid processing.

These machines have shown their viability as pipeline conditioners,
particularly  in  unattended  situations.  Natural  gas  still  needs  further
research  to  fully  comprehend  its  properties  in  supersonic  conditions.
Further  studies  are  required  on  the  effects  of  input  parameters  (tem-
perature, pressure, and composition) on boundary layer separation, as
well  as  the  effects  of  counterclockwise  vortex  generation  on  nozzle
performance.

6.1.1. Challenges in scaling supersonic separation for offshore platforms

The application of supersonic separation technology in offshore gas

turbine  environments  presents  unique  challenges  beyond  those
encountered  in  onshore  industries.  In  addition  to  the  standard  issues
faced  by  onshore  installations,  the  specific  requirements  of  offshore
platforms  introduce  additional  obstacles  related  to  size  (footprint),
weight, and stabilization in the presence of wave motion. Installations
for CO2 capture must navigate not only the constraints of limited space
but also the imperative of maintaining process efficiency [31].

Compared  to  traditional  dehydration  plants,  supersonic  separators
offer distinct advantages in terms of size, weight, cost-effectiveness, and
environmental impact. Notably, they lack spinning components, making
them suitable for autonomous operation offshore [234]. The technology
exhibits higher energy efficiency in comparison to conventional natural
gas  processing  methods,  as  supported  by  academic  research.  Despite
being a relatively recent innovation, commercial test units have been
operational  since  1998  at  various  global  sites,  including  Nigeria,  the
Netherlands, and Norway, accumulating substantial operational expe-
rience. Since 2003, Malaysia has employed supersonic separation tech-
nology for dehydration, with installations on the B11 platform owned by
Petronas and Sarawak Shell Berhad (SSB) processing up to 300 MMSCFD
[11].

The  transition  from

lab/pilot-scale  supersonic  separators  to
industrial-scale application on offshore platforms introduces formidable
challenges. Addressing these challenges necessitates a multidisciplinary
approach, integrating expertise in fluid dynamics, material science, and
offshore engineering. Successfully overcoming these hurdles holds the
key not only to unlocking the potential of supersonic separation tech-
nology  but  also  to  contributing  to  more  efficient  and  sustainable  gas
processing  in  the  demanding  offshore  environment.  Translating  the
success  of  supersonic  separators  from  lab  environments  to  offshore
platforms introduces challenges in scaling throughput. The vast quantity
of  gas  encountered  in  industrial  settings  requires  a  reevaluation  of
separator capacity without compromising efficiency.

The fluid dynamics governing supersonic separation at smaller scales
may  not  fully  encapsulate  the  complexities  of  offshore  environments.
Offshore  platforms  are  subjected  to  varying  sea  states  and  weather
conditions, necessitating a thorough understanding of how these factors
affect the performance and stability of supersonic separators. Offshore
platforms  expose  equipment  to  corrosive  elements,  challenging  the
material  integrity  of  supersonic  separators.  Selecting  materials  that
withstand  the  corrosive  nature  of  the  offshore  atmosphere  without
compromising efficiency is a critical consideration. Adapting lab-scale
separators  to  offshore  platforms  requires  seamless  integration  with
existing infrastructure. Challenges arise in aligning the separator with
other  processing  units  and  maintaining  compatibility  with  pipelines,
demanding careful planning and engineering. Offshore platforms oper-
ate  within  confined  spaces,  necessitating  a  careful  balance  between
scaling  up  separator  size  to  handle  industrial  throughput  and  main-
taining  a  compact  footprint.  Efficient  space  utilization  is  crucial  for
practical implementation.

Offshore  environments  pose  unique  challenges,  including  harsh
weather  conditions  and  the  risk  of  equipment  exposure  to  seawater.
Ensuring the safety and reliability of supersonic separators under these
circumstances requires robust design features and fail-safe mechanisms.
The offshore industry places a premium on sustainability. Assessing and
mitigating the environmental impact of supersonic separation, including
considerations  for  emissions,  waste  disposal,  and  overall  ecological
sustainability, is a crucial aspect of the scaling process.

6.2. Supersonic separator deployment factors for CO2  separation

Supersonic separators have emerged as highly efficient tools for gas
mixture separation in various industrial applications, drawing attention
due  to  their  utilization  of  supersonic  flow  principles.  However,  their
successful implementation demands a thorough exploration of practical
design  considerations  and  seamless  process  integration.  In  terms  of
practical design considerations, the choice of flow configuration proves

pivotal.  Configurations  such  as  parallel,  counter-current,  or  cross-
current  arrangements  directly  influence  velocity  profiles  within  the
separator,  impacting  separation  efficiency  [235].  Nozzle  geometry,
another critical consideration, dictates mass flow and velocity profiles at
the  separator’s  entrance,  necessitating  optimization  to  maximize  effi-
ciency  while  minimizing  pressure  loss  [37].  Material  selection  for
separator components, such as stainless steel, carbon steel, or composite
materials, is essential, with factors like pressure, temperature, and gas
corrosiveness guiding the decision-making process [79].

Process  integration  of  supersonic  separators  into  industrial  opera-
tions  requires  careful  planning  to  ensure  compatibility  with  existing
equipment  and  infrastructure.  Integration  may  involve  coupling  the
separator with compressors, filters, or heat exchangers, with a focus on
seamless operation alongside process control and safety systems. Cus-
tomization becomes imperative when employing supersonic separators
for  CO2  separation.  Nozzle  material  selection  becomes  crucial,  often
requiring materials like Hastelloy or Inconel to withstand high pressures
and temperatures [236]. The separator design itself must be optimized
for CO2 separation, involving adjustments to geometry and temperature
control  measures  to  enhance  capture  and  mitigate  gas  loss.  Process
control systems may need upgrading to cater to the specific needs of CO2
separation, incorporating advanced monitoring and control algorithms
to optimize efficiency and minimize energy consumption.

The advantages of employing supersonic separators for CO2 separa-
tion are noteworthy. They boast a smaller footprint and lower weight
suitable for offshore and crowded installations, and eliminate the need
for chemicals or solvents, thereby reducing environmental impact and
operational  costs.  Additionally,  their  adaptability  to  a  wide  range  of
pressures  and  temperatures  simplifies  process  design  and  integration.
However, challenges persist in the use of supersonic separators for CO2
separation. These include high energy consumption due to substantial
pressure drops and elevated inlet pressures, limited CO2 recovery rates
capturing  only  condensed  droplets,  potential  effects  of  impurities  on
thermodynamic properties, and the challenge of integrating with other
separation  technologies,  potentially  adding  complexity  and  cost.  The
implementation of supersonic separators in industrial processes requires
a comprehensive understanding of both practical design considerations
and the intricacies of process integration. Despite challenges, the unique
advantages  of  supersonic  separators  underscore  their  potential,  and
ongoing research and development are essential to address limitations
and enhance the reliability of this emerging technology, especially in
large-scale and offshore applications.

6.3. Potential for further research and development

Supersonic separation, a critical process in industries relying on the
efficient  separation  or  filtration  of  high-speed  gas  or  liquid  streams,
presents opportunities for further research and development (R&D) to
overcome  existing  knowledge  gaps  and  limitations.  While  significant
strides  have  been  made  in  optimizing  separation  performance  and
design, several areas require attention for enhanced prediction accuracy
and reliability, as well as addressing challenges associated with exper-
imental validation.

The influence of different parameters such as inlet port numbers, gas-
liquid area ratios, deflection angles, inlet temperatures, and outlet an-
gles of the swirler on separation performance needs thorough investi-
gation. Further experimental validation and simulation improvements
are  necessary  to  quantify  the  impact  of  these  variables  on  flow  dy-
namics, velocity profiles, and overall separation efficiency.

The design and construction of the diversion cone, responsible for
directing flow into the reflow channel, pose challenges in minimizing
disturbances.  Ongoing  research  is  required  to  optimize  the  diversion
cone’s  structure  for  improved  flow  configurations  and  separation
efficiency.

As part of the effort to enhance prediction accuracy, future research
topics  are  described,  including  modifying  the  gas  spontaneous

E. Lakzian et al.

nucleation rate model for improved prediction accuracy. The nucleation
rates  and  droplet  growth  equations  are  also  required  correction  for
different geometries and conditions. In addition to the abovementioned
equations,  the  saturation  pressure  and  saturation  temperature  are
greatly affected by temperature and pressure. In these problems, usu-
ally, the temperature becomes below 273 K. In this situation, ordinary
equations, especially saturation relationships, are not applicable.

Despite many studies on supersonic separators, maintaining a satis-
factory  purification  performance  is  still  necessary  owing  to  the  flow
within  them.  Understanding  such  a  challenging  thermodynamic  and
fluid dynamics system requires improvements and optimistic modifica-
tions in applying CFD techniques. It is recommended to conduct further
investigations  and  efforts  to  present  appropriate  equations  for  each
temperature  and  pressure  range;  it  will  facilitate  the  development  of
accurate models, particularly when attempting to capture the conden-
sation shock. In addition, a multi-component simulation is suggested to
study the effects of the concentration of different components on fluid
flow and thermodynamics.

In the separation process of a traditional supersonic separator, the
occurrence  of  shockwave  is  a  common  phenomenon  at  the  nozzle
expanding section prior to the cyclone. This shockwave is responsible for
the effective separation of the gas mixture. However, the low tempera-
ture section in the system is relatively short which leads to inadequate
cooling  effect.  This  can  lead  to  a  reduction  in  the  efficiency  of  the
separator.  Furthermore,  when  the  gas  mixture  flows  under  subsonic
conditions, it experiences swirling flow which is not efficient at subsonic
temperatures.  This  is  because  the  swirling  flow  is  less  stable  under
subsonic conditions. Hence, the performance of the separator is reduced.
To improve the efficiency of the separator, it is important to increase the
length  of  the  low  temperature  section.  This  will  enhance  the  cooling
effect  and  ultimately  improve  the  performance  of  the  separator.  The
design  of  the  separator  should  be  such  that  it  is  capable  of  handling
subsonic flow conditions without compromising its efficiency. This can
be achieved by incorporating a more stable swirling flow design in the
system.

The inclusion of discrete phase models in numerical simulation tools
can significantly improve predictions by simulating the behavior of in-
dividual particles or droplets. Further research is essential to enhance
the accuracy and reliability of these models, contributing to a deeper
understanding of separation mechanisms.

Bi-coupling methods, combining CFD simulations with experimental
measurements, offer a comprehensive approach to understanding flow
and particle behavior. Continued advancements in these techniques are
necessary for more accurate numerical simulations.

Researchers  should  focus  on  refining  assumptions  and  parameter
estimation  techniques  to  improve  the  overall  reliability  of  numerical
simulations.

Ongoing  research  and  development  efforts  should  focus  on
advancing supersonic separation technologies, making them more effi-
cient, cost-effective, and adaptable to varying operating conditions. In-
novations in materials, design, and process integration can help enhance
separation  efficiency  and  reduce  energy  consumption.  In  order  to
improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  current  supersonic
separator, the structure of the separator should be altered to relocate
where the shockwave occurs. By understanding the behavior of gases at
high velocities and temperatures, it is possible to design a separator that
maximizes the separation of different components. Additionally, the use
of swirl generation devices is common in separator designs. However,
further  investigation  is  needed  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  swirl
generation. Swirl generation devices can be used to create a vortex in the
gas stream, which enhances separation by causing the heavier compo-
nents to migrate towards the outer edges while the lighter components
remain in the center. By optimizing the design and operation of these
devices, the overall efficiency of the separator can be greatly improved.
Overall,  the combination of altered separator structure and improved
swirl  generation  devices  has  the  potential  to  greatly  enhance  the

efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  supersonic  separators.  By  applying
related theories of gas dynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics, it is
possible to design innovative solutions that address the challenges of gas
separation in a variety of industrial contexts.

6.4. Implications for the energy and combustion science field

Most of the gas collected from the wellhead is saturated vapor, with
only  traces  of  heavy  hydrocarbons.  In  the  case  that  gas  is  pumped
directly into the pipeline, the following three problems will occur: (1)
reducing  pipeline  capacity  and  increasing  power  consumption;  (2)
Natural gas contains CO2 and H2S that dissolve in water and form acid,
corrosion of pipes and equipment is caused; and (3) crystalline hydrates
form when water and gas combine, accumulating inside the pipeline,
reducing gas efficiency, making gas supply unstable, or even blocking
pipelines and equipment, causing problems with storing, transporting,
or processing it [237].

Gas-water  separation  is  therefore  necessary.  Traditionally,  four
dehydration  methods  have  been  used:  solvent  absorption,  membrane
separation,  solid  adsorption,  and  condensation  separation.  These
methods,  however,  come  with  many  disadvantages,  including  high
initial costs and energy usage, and the need for expensive equipment.
The  application  of  supersonic  separation  in  gas  purification  and  the
utilization of natural gas has significant implications for the energy and
combustion science field.

Supersonic separation helps improve the quality of natural gas used
for  combustion  processes.  By  removing  impurities,  it  enables  more
efficient and cleaner combustion, leading to enhanced energy conver-
sion  and  reduced emissions.  This drives  advancements  in  combustion
technologies and contributes to the development of more efficient and
environmentally friendly energy conversion systems.

The utilization of natural gas, coupled with effective gas purification
techniques like supersonic separation, plays a role in the transition to-
wards  cleaner  energy  sources.  Natural  gas,  with  its  lower  carbon  in-
tensity  compared  to  coal  or  oil,  can  act  as  a  bridge  fuel  during  the
transition to renewable energy systems. Understanding the implications
of  gas  purification  on combustion  science  aids  in the  development  of
sustainable energy solutions.

Supersonic separation helps in achieving emission reduction targets
by improving the quality of natural gas utilized for energy production.
Combustion  science  researchers  can  explore  the  interactions  between
purified natural gas and combustion processes to optimize combustion
conditions, reduce pollutant formation, and enhance overall energy ef-
ficiency. This knowledge supports the development of emission control
strategies and contributes to air quality improvement.

The utilization of purified natural gas obtained through supersonic
separation  offers  fuel  flexibility  for  various  combustion  systems.  Re-
searchers can study the combustion characteristics of purified natural
gas in different burner configurations, engines, turbines, and industrial
processes.  This  allows  for  the  optimization  of  combustion  parameters
and the development of tailored combustion technologies for efficient
and clean energy conversion.

The combination of supersonic separation with carbon capture and
storage technologies presents opportunities for further reducing green-
house gas emissions. By removing impurities from natural gas prior to
carbon capture, the efficiency and effectiveness of CCS can be enhanced.
This  integration  requires  interdisciplinary  collaborations  between
combustion  scientists,  process  engineers,  and  CCS  experts  to  develop
integrated systems for carbon-neutral energy production.

Understanding the implications of supersonic separation and natural
gas utilization on the overall energy system is crucial. Combustion sci-
ence researchers can contribute to system-level analysis and optimiza-
tion studies, considering the entire energy supply chain, from natural
gas  extraction  to  utilization  and  environmental  impacts.  This  holistic
approach  helps  identify  synergies,  trade-offs,  and  opportunities  for
improving overall energy efficiency and sustainability.

In summary, the application of supersonic separation in gas purifi-
cation and the utilization of natural gas has profound implications for
the  energy  and  combustion  science  field.  Natural  gas  dehydration
through the use of a supersonic whirling separator is a promising new
commercial  technology.  These  implications  span  across  combustion
technologies, emission reduction strategies, fuel flexibility, integration
with carbon capture, and system-level analysis. Ongoing research and
collaboration  in  these  areas  drive  advancements  towards  cleaner  and
more efficient energy conversion systems.

6.5. Final remarks

In conclusion, the importance of supersonic separation in gas puri-
fication and the utilization of natural gas cannot be overstated. These
processes have significant economic, environmental, and technological
implications. Supersonic separation improves the quality of natural gas
by removing impurities, leading to more efficient combustion, reduced
emissions, and enhanced energy conversion. Supersonic separators have
gained popularity in the process of natural gas dehydration, particularly
in  controlling  water  and  hydrocarbon  dew  points.  These  devices
combine condensation and separation processes, functioning like turbo
expanders, to efficiently remove water and impurities from natural gas.
The  use  of  supersonic  separators  in  natural  gas  dehydration  offers
several  advantages,  including  high  efficiency,  cost-effectiveness,  and
minimal energy consumption. Their smaller size and weight make them
suitable for offshore operations, and their eco-friendliness is appealing
to  companies  focused  on  sustainability.  Additionally,  the  absence  of
rotating parts allows for unmanned operation, which is advantageous in
offshore  facilities.  Overall,  supersonic  separators  provide  an  effective
and efficient solution for natural gas dehydration and are expected to
continue growing in popularity in the industry.
