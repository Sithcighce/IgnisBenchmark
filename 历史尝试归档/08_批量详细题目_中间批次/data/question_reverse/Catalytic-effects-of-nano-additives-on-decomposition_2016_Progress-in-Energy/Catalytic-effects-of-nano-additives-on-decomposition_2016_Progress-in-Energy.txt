The RDX, HMX, and AP are currently the most widely used energetic ingredients in composite solid pro-
pellants, since the newly developed energetic compounds are still unable to replace them due to various
bottleneck technical problems. In order to improve their combustion efficiency and performance, a common
alternative way is to utilize novel nano-sized energetic additives. There are a great many nanomaterials
that have been developed in the past decades, which include nanometal particles, metal oxides, metal
salts, metallic composites, organometallic compounds, energetic nanocatalysts, and carbon nanomaterials.
These additives could increase both the decomposition and the burning rate as well as enhance the com-
bustion efficiency of the corresponding solid propellants by changing the thermal conductivity, energy
barrier of thermolysis, heat of reaction, and gas-phase reaction mechanisms of the main ingredients such
as RDX, HMX, and AP. This review paper discusses and summarizes the effects of abovementioned nano
additives on decomposition kinetics, reaction models, decomposition mechanisms and burning rates, pres-
sure exponents, combustion wave structures, and flame propagation of RDX-, HMX-, and AP-based energetic
compositions. The catalytic mechanisms associated with different types of nanomaterials are explained
and clarified. Owing to their extremely large specific surface areas, nano-sized energetic additives have
significant catalytic effects in both condensed and gas phases during decomposition and subsequent com-
bustion via activation of the reactants and acceleration of their transition state formations. The flame
structures of AP-based composite propellants under the effect of some nanoadditives are presented showing
the enhanced burning characteristics and stabilized combustion process.

1. Introduction

Science and technology of energetic materials (EMs), including
the propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics, is becoming a more
and more important research topic due to the extensive applica-
tions of EMs in munitions, aeronautics, astronautics, mining,
constructions, and welding [1]. The EMs are still under fast devel-
opment in terms of new energetic molecules, novel energetic
compositions, advanced energetic composites, as well as unique en-
ergetic systems [2]. There has been a significant amount of new EMs
being developed during past decades including new energetic poly-
mers [3], novel nitrocompounds [4], energetic salts [5], nitrogen rich
compounds based on azole and azine rings [6–9], energetic ionic
liquids [10], nanothermites [11], energetic supermolecules (e.g. host/
guest complexes, cocrystals) [12], and polynitrogen compounds [13].
However, the newly developed energetic compounds, in most cases,
are still not capable of completely replacing currently used high EMs
due to various bottleneck technical problems, including chemical
incompatibility, thermal instability, high sensitivity, as well as high
production cost. For instance, a relatively new high-energy content
polycyclic nitramine, 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-
hexaazaisowurtzi-tane (CL-20), was developed several decades ago
[14]. Since then, it has been extensively investigated in various en-
ergetic compositions, including polymer bonded explosives and
propellants [15–19], but it is still not widely used in munitions charges
due to high cost and safety problems associated with its polymor-
phic transitions at relatively low temperatures in the presence of
plasticizers [20,21]. In order to develop low vulnerable ammuni-
tions, many new insensitive energetic compounds have also been
developed, including 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) [22] and
its derivatives [23]. However, such insensitive compounds are much
less energetic than CL-20 [24] and therefore cannot be widely used
in high explosives and long-range weapons. To solve the contra-
dictive problem regarding high-energy density vs. low sensitivity,
a novel energetic salt dihydroxylammonium 5,5′-bistetrazole- 1,1′-
diolate (TKX-50) has been recently developed, using a cheap facile
preparation method from commonly available chemicals [25]. The
energy content of this material is comparable to that of CL-20, al-
though it is more insensitive than most of the currently used energetic
fillers [26]. However, TKX-50 has been found to be incompatible with
the common ingredients used in solid propellants [27].

As stated above, in spite of many achievements being made in the
development of high EMs, the ones being used currently in the afore-
mentioned applications predominantly include only binder systems
typically based on nitrocellulose (NC), nitroglycerin (NG), glycidyl azide
polymer (GAP) or hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and en-
ergetic fillers including cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX, C3H6N6O6),

1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX, C4H8N8O8, high melting-
point explosives), ammonium nitrate [AN, NH4NO3], and ammonium
perchlorate (AP, NH4ClO4) [28]. In fact, these materials as well as their
compositions have been intensively investigated in past years re-
garding their preparation methods, mechanical properties, sensitivities,
and performances (decomposition, combustion, and detonation) [29].
Particularly, the decomposition and combustion of EMs received the
most worldwide attention for their irreplaceably important roles in
the compatibility, safety, rocket engine designs, and performance of
ammunitions [30–32]. The decomposition could be considered as the
initial stage of combustion, where the combustion science is very
popular and a hot topic in many fields including EMs, fossil fuel in-
dustry, satellite launching, rocket motor designs, and renewable energy
developments [33]. For the sake of improving the decomposition and
combustion performances of the current energetic compositions in
the field of EMs, some other strategies have to be attempted when
the safer materials with higher energy content are not available for
replacement. These strategies include developments of particle surface
modifications (coating and milling), new energetic systems (charge
designs), super energetic molecules (co-crystals and complexes) and
novel additives (nanometal fuels, nano catalysts).

In particular, because it is the most efficient way of improving
the performances of energetic compositions, the use of nano-
sized additive materials has attracted more and more attention [34].
The development and advancement of nanoscience and nanotech-
nology has allowed the capability to create controlled structures to
optimize a broad range of catalytic processes in decomposition and
combustion of energetic compositions. Generally, the nanomaterials
have quite unique mechanical, optical, chemical, and electrical prop-
erties when compared to the bulk-sized ones [35]. There are a great
many such nanomaterials being developed as additives of energet-
ic compositions in the past decades, which include nanometal
particles (Al, Mg, B, W, Zr, Ni, Cu, Fe, Ag, Co, In, and Pt) [36], metal
oxides (mainly Pb, Cu, Bi and, Fe-based oxides) [37], metal salts, me-
tallic composites (metal complexes, nanothermites) [38],
organometallic compounds [39], and carbon nanomaterial-based
composites (carbon nanotubes, graphene, and fullerenes) [40,41].
Most of the abovementioned nano-sized additives are commonly
used as burning rate catalyst, which is one of the key parameters
of rocket propellants [42,43]. These nanomaterials can be pre-
pared by various methods, including solid phase reaction, electrolysis,
hydrothermal reaction, precipitation, hydrolysis, sol–gel, and micro-
lacteous methods [44]. Because of the very high enthalpy of reaction,
the final phase compositions, morphology, and thermodynamic prop-
erties of the reactive nanocomposites are different from those of their
micron-scaled counterparts [45] resulting in ignition mechanisms
governed by heterogeneous reactions [46,47]. Therefore, these

nano-sized additives, especially the nanocatalysts, could increase
the decomposition rate, enhance the burning rate, and combus-
tion efficiency of the corresponding energetic compositions by
changing the thermal conductivity, energy barrier of thermolysis,
heat of reaction, and gas-phase reaction mechanisms of the main
ingredients such as energetic fillers (RDX, HMX, AP) and corre-
sponding binders (NC-NG, GAP, and HTPB). Thanks to the rapid
development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, and in particu-
lar a theoretical understanding of the tuning of electronic structure
in nanoscale systems, this element of design is becoming possible
via precise control of nanoparticles’ composition, morphology, struc-
ture and electronic states [45]. In order to systematically show the
important role of nano-additives on the performances of energet-
ic compositions, the effects of these nanomaterials on decomposition
kinetics, reaction models, decomposition mechanisms and burning
rates, pressure exponents, combustion wave structures, and flame
propagation rates of RDX, HMX, AP and their polymer binders are
summarized in this review paper.

2. Catalytic decomposition of RDX, HMX, and AP

As newly developed energetic ingredients, it is essential to eval-
uate their thermal properties, since they have intrinsic connections
to the combustion and detonation performances of the final charges
containing these ingredients [48–51]. There are several param-
eters that need to be evaluated, including thermal stability, heat of
decomposition, activation energy (Ea), reaction models, as well as
thermolysis chemical pathways [52–55]. As mentioned above, nano-
sized additives have a larger specific surface area (SSA) with more
active sites, and hence they are more effective than micro-sized par-
ticles on accelerating decomposition of energetic substances,
including RDX, HMX, AP, and their polymer binders.

2.1. Catalytic effects on thermal stability and heat release

2.1.1. Thermal behavior of RDX and RDX-based propellants

RDX is a nitramine explosive that is widely used in military and
industrial applications [56]. Synthesized for medical uses in 1899,

it was developed as an explosive after World War II, as a more pow-
erful alternative to TNT. Nowadays, in most cases, RDX and RDX-
based compositions are usually used as the standard reference for
newly developed energetic materials as well as additives. RDX is still
under development in terms of modified RDX crystals with low sen-
sitivity [57] and nano-sized RDX with better performances [58].
Thermal stability of RDX is now well understood after more than
a century’s worth of research conducted within various cutting-
edge facilities. The effects of nano-additives on its thermal stability
have been extensively investigated as well in past decades. With a
heating rate of 5 °C min−1, RDX starts to melt at around 203–
204 °C, followed by a slow decomposition process that has a peak
temperature of 240–242 °C [59]. The use of nano-additives can gen-
erally increase the reactivity and decrease the peak temperature of
RDX. The typical additives are catalysts and metallic fuels, where
the latter includes the pure metal particles and nanothermites.

Since 2001, the nano-sized CuO (10 nm) was first prepared by
a high-energy ball-milling method, and it has been found to be very
effective in catalyzing the decomposition of RDX [60]. Due to fast
development of nanotechnologies, more and more nano-sized ad-
ditives have been synthesized in recent years. Nanocomposite PbSnO3
was synthesized by co-precipitation method, and its phase evolu-
tion process was investigated [61]. It has been shown that the nano-
sized PbSnO3 with a diameter of 9 nm could be obtained when
calcining at 600 °C for 2 hours, and its crystal is cubic in pyrochlore
type. Except for inorganic salt, the organic salt of copper (II) resorcylic
acid (CuRes) nanoparticles was also synthesized using 2,4-
dihydroxybenzoic acid and blue copper as the raw materials by a
reactive precipitation method [62]. The CuRes has a particle size of
about 20 nm and can greatly increase the reactivity of the double-
base (NC-NG) propellant, which is usually used as a standard material
to test the effectiveness of the catalysts. Another organic additive
is nano lead (II) citrate (nPbCT, Pb3(C6H5O7)2), which could be syn-
thesized by a liquid dispersion deposition method using PEG-400
as the surfactant [63]. It can be combined with energetic fillers such
as RDX via a dissolution/dilution/crystallization method, forming
a new energetic composite (mass content of RDX is greater than 92%),
which could make its catalytic effect much stronger. Except inert

additives, the energetic salt, lead complex of 3,6-bis(1H-1,2,3,4-
tetrazol-5-ylamino)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (LCBTATz, Scheme 1), can also
be prepared to improve the energy content of the propellants [64].
In the past, the commonly used organic burning-rate catalyst was
based on alkylferrocene, including n-butyl-ferrocene (NBF), tert-
butylferrocene (TBF), and 2,2-bis- (ethylferrocenyl) propane
(catocene), which tends to migrate during curing and storage due
to their neutral and nonpolar nature. To solve these problems, fifteen
novel ionic compounds, 1-(ferrocenylmethyl) imidazolium paired
with polycyano anions, have been recently synthesized [65]. The
polycyano anions include 1,1,3,3-tetracyano propenide (TCP), 1,1,2,3,3-
pentacyanopropen-ide (PCP), and 1,1,2,5,6,6-hexacyano-3,4-
diazahexadienide (HCP). The compounds based on TCP are semi-
solid or oil when n-C4H9 is the function group with a crystal point
at −18.3 °C, and the ones based on PCP and HCP are solids with
melting points in the range of 73.0–155.4 °C. The basic molecular
structure and corresponding function groups are shown in Scheme 1.
Among these ferrocene derivatives, three of them are based on C2H5,
using TCP, PCP, and HCP as anions, named as nPTCP, nPPCP, and
nPHCP, respectively. Their catalytic effects on decomposition and
combustion of RDX and AP-based compositions were investi-
gated, which will be discussed in the following sections.

The catalyst with normal particle sizes can usually change the
characteristic value of thermal decomposition and the initial de-
composition mechanism of RDX and NC-NG, resulting in faster heat
releases and higher burning rates [66]. The effect of nano-sized

additives has to be compared with normal additives for better evalu-
ations. To further enhance the catalytic effect and improve the flaring
performance, a single additive such as metal oxide could be de-
posited on highly thermal conductive materials, including carbon
nanotubes (CNTs), by a microemulsion process, forming a new type
of nano-combustion catalyst [67]. It was confirmed by SEM anal-
ysis that the nano-oxides are uniformly deposited on the surface
of carbon nanotubes (Fig. 1), with a particle size that is below 50 nm.
As a common catalyst, the perovskite-type materials have been used
for many years in fossil fuel combustion to decrease the soot emis-
sions. It may also be used as combustion catalysts in solid propellants.
Typical examples are LaMnO3 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, which had high
SSA when they were prepared by stearic acid gel combustion method
[71]. In addition to solid additives, two hollow CuFe2O4 nanospheres
(CuFe2O4-p and CuFe2O4-d) were also successfully prepared using
a hydrothermal method [72]. The CuFe2O4-p has smaller sizes and
higher BET SSA than CuFe2O4-d. A comparison has been made on
the morphologies of nano-CuO, nano-Fe2O3, CuO/Fe2O3 mixture,
CuFe2O4-p, and CuFe2O4-d (Fig. 2). Their catalytic activity on the
thermal decomposition of RDX was systematically investigated. It
can be observed from Fig. 2 that the CuO sample consists of irreg-
ular blocks of sizes in the range of 400–500 nm. As shown in Fig. 2b,
a large amount of Fe2O3 nanoparticles aggregate, forming a
spherical structure with a diameter approximately 500 nm. For
CuO/Fe2O3 mixture, the Fe2O3 particles are dispersed on the surface
of CuO. CuFe2O4-p and CuFe2O4-d are composed of uniform

In addition to using the metal oxides or metal salts as additives,
RDX can also be coated with nano-sized particles, including
nanometals, nanodiamonds, or nano-sized RDX crystal coated with
engetic polymers, forming some novel energetic composites. The
nano-sized Al could be coated with RDX and form a novel core-
shell structure. Alternatively, RDX could be coated with nanodiamonds
(nDs). It was reported that a well-dispersed and uniformly shaped
nDs were produced and used to coat micron-sized RDX particles
[68]. The nDs particles were deposited and absorbed on the surface
of RDX and evenly coated over RDX. The coating thickness in-
creased as the amount of nDs increased (4 kinds of particles with
different nDs thicknesses were prepared). The SEM images of two
kinds of coated RDX particles are shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, the nano-
sized RDX was coated by GAP using sol–gel and solution crystallization
methods, forming new energetic nanocomposites with particle sizes
between 20 and 50 nm [69]. In order to make a mutual comparison
of the thermal behavior and catalytic effects of different nano-
sized additives, their DSC parameters data of abovementioned
materials are summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, in all cases, the catalytic effect of nano-
catalyst is better than the normal analogs. With the increase of the
additives’ contents, the catalytic effects could be enhanced. For in-
stance, the catalytic activity of nanocomposite PbSnO3 on the thermal
decomposition of RDX is obvious. It can decrease the peak temper-
ature from 240.1 to 236.5 °C, but there was an increase in the
decomposition enthalpy ΔH to about 70% (722 J·g−1). Similarly, the
exothermic peak of RDX in presence of LaMnO3 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3
shifted from 246.6 °C to 244.5 °C and 243.3 °C, respectively. It seems
that LaMnO3 is a more effective catalyst than La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 for the
sublimation and melting process of RDX because of its higher con-
centration ratio of surface-adsorbed species. This could be attributed
to its higher concentration ratios of surface oxygen and Mn4+/
Mn3+, indicating that such concentration ratios play a key role for
RDX thermal decomposition [72].

Moreover, the ionic ferrocene compounds based on polycyano
anions exhibit significant effects on the thermal decomposition of
RDX. The catalytic activities of the new compounds are higher than
those of their nitrate and picrate analogs, this supports the con-
clusion that high nitrogen content in a ferrocene-based BR catalyst
is favorable for its combustion catalytic activity [65]. In addition to
traditional metal oxides and composites additives, there are some
new additives based on the carbon nanomaterials (CNMs). A typical

CNMs, the porous structure of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), featured
with large adsorbable SSA, can be considered as a combustion cat-
alyst carrier in a nanoscale, and several abovementioned composite
catalysts can be deposited on CNTs. The synergistic effect of the CNTs
with carried catalysts may greatly improve catalytic activity, and
the agglomeration problem of nano-sized catalysts may be im-
proved as well. For instance, Ag/CNTs nanocomposite was prepared
and its catalytic effect on decomposition of RDX was investigated
[73]. It was indicated that the irregularly globose nano-Ag par-
ticles attached to the surface of the nano CNTs evenly, forming a
promising composite catalyst for RDX. This may greatly accelerate
the decomposition rate as well as increase the amount of heat release
over 2500 J g−1. This is also the case for PbO · CuO/CNTs catalyst, which
can accelerate the decomposition rate of RDX, and reduce the Tp by
14.1 °C as well [74]. As another form of CNMs, the nDs can either
slightly increase or reduce the peak temperature of RDX depend-
ing on the concentration of coating [68]. The excessive coating, of
over 1/3 of nDs, could hinder the decomposition and gas diffusion
as an inert shell. In contrast, the nano-Al particles with an average
diameter of 60 nm can only decrease the decomposition peak tem-
perature of RDX by 4.4 °C at the heating rates of 5 °C min−1. These
observable changes indicate that Al nanoparticles act as catalysts
for the thermal decomposition of RDX. Except for CNTs based ad-
ditives and nDs, there are another groups based on fullerene. One
of the typical examples is the fullerene hydrazine nitrate (mNPF),
which was mixed with RDX as a catalyst, making its peak decom-
position temperature decrease from 240.4 °C to 234.0 °C, while the
corresponding exothermic heat release increased from 499.5 to
891.8 J g−1. Similarly, it was further found that FHN can also accel-
erate the decomposition of RDX and HMX. The peak temperatures
of the exothermal decomposition are reduced and corresponding
Ea of RDX is decreased by 17 kJ mol−1, and that of HMX is reduced
by more than 20 kJ mol−1 [75]. In fact, there is another two fullerene-
based catalysts; so called fullerene hydrazine nitrate (FED) [76] and
(FEN) [77], whose catalytic effect has not been tested yet. It was
shown that FED started to decompose at 150 °C with a Tp of 203 °C
and exothermic enthalpy change of 1037.7 J g−1. The total mass loss
of FED in the temperature range of 100–800 °C is 49.7% with an entire
decomposition of —N(NO2)2 and partial decomposition of the
branched chain [76]. As a comparison, FEN decomposes only in two
stages: the first-stage with 40.8% mass loss (100–250 °C), due to
intense scission of NO3— and partial decomposition of the branched
chain, releasing H2O, CO2, CO, N2O, and NO2. The second-stage con-
sists of a 59.2% of mass loss (250–580 °C), due to the decomposition

of the residual branched chain in the carbon cage, releasing CO2 [77].
In order to understand the catalytic behavior of fullerene-based nano-
sized additives, one has to check their decomposition processes alone.
For a simple comparison, the TG/DTG curves of several selected
fullerene additives under a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 are shown
in Fig. 3.

According to Fig. 3, there are at least two steps involved in the
decomposition of these fullerene derivatives, which start between
100 and 150 °C, this range is far lower than that of RDX. It is also
the case for 1-(ferrocenylmethyl) imidazolium and polycyano anions
based additives, such as nPTCP, nPPCP, and nPHCP, which decom-
pose below 215 °C. Therefore, there are two peaks for decomposition
DSC curves when the additives are coated on RDX. The first one cor-
responds to the decomposition of the additives. In particular, a novel
fullerene phenylalanine lead salt (FPL) has never been used in en-
ergetic compositions, but it is still an interesting additive, because
it can undergo a four-step exothermic process starting from 135 °C

[78], which can reduce the peak decomposition temperature, Tp, of
RDX by more than 20 °C, and decrease the activation energy (Ea) by
30 kJ mol−1. In contrast, FHN could undergo at least four decompo-
sition steps under an N2 atmosphere, starting around 150 °C, while
FEN decomposes in only two steps, as mentioned above. More-
over, FHN would decompose completely in the air with a trace
amount of residue. The FED mainly decomposes in one slow step
with a mass loss of 3.3%, followed by a fast thermalysis step with
a mass loss of around 50%. These additives may decompose with
the heat release before the melting point of RDX, which could make
RDX decompose much earlier by lowering its melting point.

Regarding the catalytic decomposition of RDX-based propel-
lants using nano-sized additives, the data from the literature are
very limited. Under the effect of LCBTATz, RDX-DB propellant un-
derwent two continuous exothermic stages according to the TG
experiments, but only one exothermic peak was observed with DSC
curves in the temperature range of 120–267 °C. Generally speaking,

several listed Refs. [75–78] with permissions.)

under the effect of nano-sized additives the decomposition mech-
anism should be changed, which could result in different heat
releases both in quantity and rate. However, it can be seen from
Table 1 that the amount of heat release from the decomposition of
RDX is also largely dependent on the testing facility. Therefore, when
using the data of pure RDX as reference material it should be taken
from the same research group for better comparisons. In particu-
lar, the metal oxides or inorganic metal salts may induce faster heat
release rates with narrower ΔT, which are usually in the range of
20–28 °C. The additives such as CuFe2O4, FHN, and NBF could de-
crease the peak ΔT below 20 °C, indicating better catalytic activity.
Regarding the organic additives, all of them could increase the de-
composition heat except NBF, whose particle size is not in a
nanoscale. Based on the abovementioned results, one could see that
nano-sized additives have a strong catalytic effect on thermal de-
composition of RDX in terms of the amount of heat release and peak
temperature. To better understand how these additives could affect
the decomposition mechanism of RDX, further information is col-
lected and summarized in Section 2.2.1.

2.1.2. Thermal behavior of HMX and HMX-based compositions

HMX (octogen) is another powerful and relatively insensitive
cyclic nitramine, very similar to RDX both in structure and property.
The difference is RDX decomposes in the liquid state after melting,
while HMX usually decomposes in the solid state after polymor-
phic transition. The name HMX is the subject of much speculation,
having been variously listed as high melting explosive, high-
velocity military explosive, or high-molecular-weight RDX [79]. HMX
was first made in 1943, and later on it was discovered that HMX
could be prepared by nitrolysis of RDX. Therefore, their thermal de-
composition mechanisms should be very similar to each other.
Previous investigations on the thermal decomposition of HMX below
its melting point (270 °C) indicated that the nucleation and growth
of bubbles containing gaseous decomposition products played a key
role in the solid-phase reaction.

The thermal behavior of HMX could be greatly affected by the
contact materials, including polymers, plasticizers, and other additives.

The nano-sized additives have a much stronger catalytic effect on
the decomposition of HMX than the other materials due to a greater
mutual interaction. Similar to RDX, owing to the development of
nanotechnology since 2001, a large amount of nano-sized addi-
tives has been used in HMX-based compositions. The effects of nano
aluminum, nickel, and copper particles on thermal decomposition
of HMX were first investigated in 2002 [80]. It was shown that nano
copper has the greatest effect on the condensed-phase decompo-
sition of HMX, which would be weakened by decreasing the
copper content or increasing the ambient pressure. To create the
best contact, HMX/Cu composite particles could be prepared by
the electroless plating method with the morphology shown in Fig. 4
[82]. The coating of Cu with a particle size of 80 nm has an obvious
catalysis effect on the solid-phase decomposition of HMX.

In addition to metal particles, the most widely used additives
are metal oxides and perovskite-type metal salts as catalysts. For
instance, as additives of HMX, the LaFeO3 and α-Fe2O3 with high SSA
were prepared by a novel stearic acid solution combustion method
[83]. It has been shown that the catalytic activity of perovskite-
type LaFeO3 was much better than that of α-Fe2O3 because of higher
concentration of surface-adsorbed oxygen and hydroxyl on LaFeO3
nano particles. On the basis of this finding, this research group also
prepared some other perovskite-type nano-sized catalysts includ-
ing LaCoO3 [84], LaMnO3, LaOCl [85], and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 by gel
combustion [86]. It was found that the as-prepared LaCoO3 was more
active than the calcined one due to the same feature as LaFeO3. The
LaOCl powder actually is a mixture of LaOCl with a significant
amount of amorphous materials, which could be converted to a
single-phase LaMnO3 if kept at 600 °C. Interestingly, the LaOCl
powder has better catalytic activity than LaMnO3 during the early
stages of HMX thermal decomposition. The additive La0.8Sr0.2MnO3
has a similar effect to HMX as it does to the RDX mentioned above,
where the mixture system of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions, as well as the
lattice oxygen, played a key role in promoting the decomposition
heat release of HMX. Recently, there were two more perovskite-
type nanometer metal salts, PbSnO3 [81] and Bi2WO6 [87] powder,
that were successfully prepared by an ultrasound/co-precipitation

method and hydrothermal method, respectively. The Bi2WO6 could
reduce the decomposition temperature and apparent activation
energy of decomposition process.

The SEM images for the morphologies of all above-mentioned
metal oxides and perovskite-type metal salts are compared in Fig. 5.
It is clear that all the additives have the particle sizes below 100 nm.
There is some agglomeration for LaFeO3, LaOCl, PbSnO3, and La2O2CO3,
which proved to be less active than the other perovskite-type ad-
ditives. The PH value has a great effect on the particle size and
agglomeration on nano-sized Bi2WO6 prepared at 160 °C for 20 hours.
The powder prepared with a pH of 8 is relatively homogeneous with
a particle size of about 100 nm, while for those with a pH value of
10, the products have a spherical shape with great homogeneity and
a uniform particle size of about 40 nm. Except for the perovskite-
type metal salts, nanometal oxides or organic lead salts were found
to be very effective as burning rate catalysts. The effects of nano-
sized TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and SiO2 on decomposition of HMX were
investigated [88]. It was shown that the key factors that determine
the catalytic activity of these oxides are SSA, contents, and the PH
values on the surfaces of the metal oxides. The catalytic efficiency
of nano-sized TiO2 on HMX combustion and thermolysis processes
was largely dependent on its surface acidity. Moreover, the effects
of two nano organic lead catalysts (nano lead 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate
and lead phthalate) on thermal decomposition of double-base pro-
pellants are presented here for a comparison [89]. In order to better
compare the catalytic efficiency of the abovementioned nano ad-
ditives, the thermal decomposition parameters of HMX under the
effect of these additives were evaluated by DSC experiments, which
are summarized in Table 2.

Generally, as shown in Table 2, the onset temperature (To) of HMX
thermal decomposition is between 280 and 284 °C depending on

the particle sizes and experimental conditions. The α-Fe2O3 does
not change the To of HMX, but the peak temperature (Tp) is found
to have decreased by 5.1 °C. The To of HMX in the presence of LaFeO3
can decrease by 30 °C, but the peak temperature (Tp) only de-
creases by 6.3 °C. Similar to LaFeO3, nanosize La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, α-Fe2O3,
Bi2WO6, and La2O2CO3 also had very significant effects on To of HMX
decomposition (<230 °C). On the other hand, their effects on the Tp
were very limited (>277 °C). This means LaFeO3, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3,
La2O2CO3, and α-Fe2O3 would make HMX decompose at a much lower
temperature but with slower reaction rate, whereby the strong auto-
catalytic effect of HMX might be excluded. The other perovskite-
type metal salts such as LaCoO3, LaMnO3, LaOCl, and PbSnO3 have
very comparable catalytic effects on decomposition of HMX, de-
creasing its To to a range of 235–272 °C with a decrease in Tp of more
than 5 °C, or even 12.2 °C for PbSnO3. It is interesting to notice that
La2O2CO3 and LaOCl could increase the Tp due to a stronger effect
on the auto-accelerating reaction of HMX. Regarding the decom-
position heat, it was shown that the decomposition heat of
HMX with nano PbSnO3 increases from 1350 to 1573 J·g−1. The self-
accelerating decomposition temperature and the critical temperature
of the thermal explosion under the effect of PbSnO3 are found to
increase from 168.3 to 178.1 °C, which is promising for its practi-
cal applications [81]. It is also the case for La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, where the
heat was increased from 529 to 625 J·g−1, which is much lower than
those of PbSnO3 due to the differences in DSC facility. The heat flow
properties for the other abovementioned additives are not avail-
able in the literature.

Regarding the CNMs, it was found that FHN could also acceler-
ate decomposition of HMX. As shown above, the Tp of the exothermal
decomposition of RDX was greatly reduced while for HMX, it
was only reduced by 2.2 °C [75]. Similarly, the decomposition of

a CNTs with diameter of 10–20 nm.

HMX/CNT composites showed that the CNTs may reduce Tp of
HMX also about 2.0 °C [90]. However, the decomposition heat
and Tp of HMX would decrease as the CNT content increases.
Similar experiments have been carried out for CL-20 and
aminonitrobenzodifuroxan (CL-18) using DSC and TG techniques
[91,92], showing that CNTs would also be able to bring down their
initial decomposition temperature. The proposed reason was that
CNTs would favor homolytic scission of the N—NO bond, thereby
promoting ·NO free radical generation. In contrast, the existence of
nanometal powders such as nCu, nNi and nAl would promote a pro-
portion of condensed-state decomposition of HMX, which was
attributed to the consequence of more reaction sites (hotspots and
physical adsorption sites) offered by nanometal powders. On the one
hand, a high coefficient of heat conduction of nanometal powder
would lead to the formation of local hotspots during the heating
process of HMX. Once formed, they will react exothermically to
promote the decomposition of the HMX crystals. On the other hand,
nanometal powders would trap more pyrolysis products as more
physical adsorption sites formed and as the particle size de-
creased. Such effects would make HMX less stable under a linear
heating condition. At an early stage, the proportion heat of decom-
position increased from 2.37% to 97.29% [80]. Moreover, the Tp of
HMX decreased to a much lower temperature with a change to
35.53 °C, while the reaction rate slowed down. The thermal de-
composition of HMX/Cu became very intense when the heating rate
increases to 15 °C min−1. One has to keep in mind that decompo-
sition mechanism of HMX is largely dependent on the heating rate,

due to the relatively strong volatile nature of the compound [93,94].
In contrast, the nano lead salt catalysts n-β-Pb n-PhtP could shorten
the decomposition course and accelerate the exothermic rate of the
energetic matrix NC/NG that is usually used in double-base pro-
pellants. Even the second peak temperature was only slightly reduced
(0.2 °C) or stayed the same.

2.1.3. Thermal behavior of AP and AP-based propellants

As a salt of perchloric acid and ammonia, AP is usually used as
a powerful oxidizer in solid composite propellants mainly for ap-
plications in the rockets and missiles. It can be produced on a large
scale by reacting ammonium salts with sodium perchlorate. When
AP was mixed with a fuel including high explosives, metal powders,
and/or with an elastomeric binder, it was able to generate self-
sustained combustion levels at far under atmospheric pressure
[52,95,96]. For several decades, it has been the most important oxi-
dizer used in solid rockets, including military, amateur, hobby high-
power rockets, and even in some fireworks. Over the last several
decades, numerous research works have been devoted to the thermal
behavior and structural properties of AP [97]. The decomposition
of AP is rather complicated even though it is a simple compound,
mainly because this molecule consists of four different elements (N,
H, Cl, and O). If all of the potential oxidation states of these ele-
ments have to be considered, more than 1000 possible chemical
reactions could be involved in the decomposition of AP [98]. More-
over, the significant difference between AP and the other ingredients
of propellants and explosives is the presence of chlorine. It was found

85

that the impurities/additives could play a significant role in the de-
composition kinetics and mechanisms, burning rate, and pressure
exponents of AP-based composite propellants. Due to the complex-
ity of AP decompositions, the inherent chemical mechanism is still
not well understood [99]. The thermal decomposition characteris-
tics of AP might be able to properly show the combustion behavior
of the corresponding propellants that are based on it [100–102]. In
order to understand the complex physicochemical process that un-
derlies the thermal decomposition of AP under the effects of nano-
sized additives one has to check the heat flow properties and the
corresponding kinetic parameters. Doing so would provide a link
between the physical properties of nano additives and the decom-
position mechanisms of AP, which may also offer some clues for
selecting the most proper nano additives for advanced propel-
lants and explosives with controlled ignition and combustion
properties, as well as acceptable sensitivity.

As the most widely used combinations, a variety of metal fuels
and complexes were prepared in nanometer scales to enhance the
performances of AP-based compositions. For instance, the effects
of Al and Ni powders of various grain sizes on the thermal decom-
position of AP were investigated by TG and DSC in a dynamic
nitrogen atmosphere [103]. It was found that the nanoNi powders
had a greater influence on the decomposition characteristics of AP
than superfine nickel [104]. NanoNi powders could increase the de-
composition rate of the low-temperature stage decomposition of
AP, and decrease the Tp of the high-temperature decomposition stage.
A recent research further confirmed that the nano Ni powders have
the greatest influence on the decomposition rate of micro-sized AP
among all the metal powders [105]. Such accelerating effects of
nanoNi powders are more apparent on the stage of high temper-
ature decompositions than that of low temperature ones, which was
weakened when the content of nanonickel decreased. Meanwhile,
it was shown that the Al powders (both micron-sized and nano-
sized) have little effect on peak decomposition temperature Tp of
AP [105]. Except for pure AP, the nanometal powders such as Cu,
Ni, Al, NiCu, NiCuB, and NiB would greatly affect the thermal de-
composition characteristics of AP/HTPB propellants [106]. It was
indicated that the pure metal and composite metal nanopowders
have great catalytic effects on the thermal decomposition of AP/
HTPB propellants as well [107]. Nano-NiCu composite powder with
different ratios of Ni to Cu was prepared, and its catalysis on py-
rolysis of AP and AP/HTPB propellants was investigated. It has been
shown that this composite powder could greatly decrease the values
of Tp of AP and AP/HTPB propellants as well as increase the total

apparent decomposition heat [108]. The ratios of Ni/Cu determine
the activity of the nanoNiCu composites. Among various ratios the
Ni/Cu = 60/40 exhibits the best catalytic effect. In addition to metal
powders and their alloys, metal particles can also be combined with
carbon nanomaterials such as CNTs and nanodiamonds. For example,
the Cu/UDD (ultradispersed diamond) nanocomposites were pre-
pared by simultaneously reducing the CuCl2 aqueous solution and
doping it with 0.7 wt.% of UDD [109]. Then the nano Ni/CNT com-
posite catalyst was prepared by a chemical liquid deposition. The
catalysis of nano Ni/CNTs on thermal decomposition of AP and AP/
HTPB propellant was investigated by means of DSC. The results
showed that nano Ni can be coated uniformly on the surface of CNTs.
Nano Ni/CNTs can decrease the peak temperatures Tp of the thermal
decomposition of AP and AP/HTPB propellant, but the total appar-
ent decomposition heat was increased significantly [110]. In order
to compare the effectiveness, the nano Cu/CNT composite catalyst
was prepared by a liquid reductive deposition method with carbon
nanotubes as the carrier [111]. It was observed that, similar to Ni/
CNTs, the Cu/CNTs could remarkably decrease the high temperature
decomposition peaks and evidently increase the apparent decom-
position heat. The morphology, microstructure, and composition of
abovementioned nanoadditives were characterized by means of SEM
(Fig. 6), XRD, and XPS.

Except for nanometal fuels, the nanometal oxides have been used
as catalysts in AP-based compositions [95], where the most widely
used one is iron oxide (Fe2O3) [112–114]. The particle size of Fe2O3
has a significant effect on the decomposition of AP. It was con-
firmed that the size reduction of Fe2O3 to nanometers (Fig. 6)
contributes to the decomposition of AP-based solid propellants with
lower reaction temperature and activation energy [115]. Some other
nanomaterials such as CNTs and nanometals forming high-energy
thermites can carry the Fe2O3. CNT-supported Fe2O3 could be pre-
pared by a sol–gel method and it was proved that the product was
nano-sized hexagonal α-Fe2O3 loaded on CNTs substrate. The Fe2O3/
CNT composite could accelerate AP thermal decomposition at a
relatively low temperature range. It was suggested that the im-
provement of the catalytic activity was due to higher dispersion of
Fe2O3 nanoparticles, providing more active reaction sites. The Fe2O3
can also be used to prepare a nanothermite by combining it with
nano-Al. Then it could be used as a high-energy ingredient for AP-
based propellants [116]. Its catalytic activity on the thermal
decomposition of AP and AP-based composite propellants was in-
vestigated and the corresponding ignition delay was measured. The
nanothermites Al/Fe2O3 decreased the activation energy values of

AP for ignition, thereby improving the decomposition rate of AP and
its propellants [117].

In addition to the widely used Fe2O3, there are several other nano-
sized metal oxides being applied to AP-based compositions. The effect
of nano-sized CuO on the decomposition AP was significant, and
the catalytic activity was increased many times when compared to
CuO in micron sizes [118]. It was observed that the CuO nanocrystals
exhibit a particular chemical reactivity due to their high concen-
tration of dislocations and large SSA [119]. In general, the catalytic
activity on thermal decomposition of AP also depends on the mor-
phology of the nanocrystals [120]. A comparative study was
performed on this issue, indicating that the catalytic activity of
CuO could be enhanced by approximately five times when the
morphology is regular, smooth, and cubic (Fig. 7b) [121]. The content
of CuO also has a strong influence on the catalytic effects. It was
observed that 0.5% of nano-sized CuO is even better than 1% of
micron sized CuO. With the nCuO content increase, the decompo-
sition rate of AP was increased accordingly. It can be seen from
Table 4 that the position of the second exothermic peak of AP was
decreased by 107 °C when compared to the pure AP. If nCuO was
used in AP-based propellants with an HTPB binder, then the nCuO/
AP composite would need to be prepared first in order for the nCuO
in the HTPB matrix to be better dispersed. This is called the pre-
dispersing procedure [122]. To solve the problems of moisture
absorption and aggregation of superfine AP and the aggregation of
nano-sized catalysts in composite propellants, the CuO/AP/HTPB
nanocomposites need to be prepared without contacting the other
components of the composite propellants [122]. The CuO/AP
nanocomposites (Fig. 7b) should be prepared first by a novel ceramic
membrane anti-solvent crystallization method, and then the CuO/
AP/HTPB nanocomposites (Fig. 7c) could be prepared by a solution
evaporating method. It was observed in Fig. 7(h) that the CuO/AP/
HTPB nano particles are hexahedrons with a size of less than 6 μm,
and the CuO nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of AP.

The outer layer of HTPB binder could effectively prevent the mois-
ture absorption of the superfine AP. Except for nCuO, rare earth metal
oxide nanoparticles such as CeO2, Pr2O3, and Nd2O3 were also used
as additives for AP-based propellants [123]. These nano oxides could
be prepared by a sol–gel route using Ce(NO3)3 · 6H2O, Pr(NO3)3 · 6H2O,
and Nd(NO3)3 · 6H2O, and citric acid as the precursors. It could be
seen from the SEM images (Fig. 7j–l) that these particles are spher-
ical in shape and the average particle size is in the range of 11–
30 nm [123]. Except for nano-sized Fe2O3, CuO, and rare earth metal
oxides, there are several other nanometal oxides that have been used
as additives for AP-based compositions. It has very recently been
shown that the catalytic effect of ZnO and NiO nano crystals on the
thermal decomposition of AP is also significant. The decomposi-
tion temperature and activation energy were largely decreased due
to the catalytic effect of ZnO and hierarchical NiO [124,125], where
the peak temperature of AP was decreased by about 52 °C. More-
over, the effect of TiO2 nanocatalyst in terms of its SSA on the thermal
decomposition properties of AP was examined [126]. It is clear that
the decomposition temperature Tp of AP decreases with the in-
crease in SSA of TiO2. It was also found that TiO2 could affect the
frequency factor of AP decomposition, even though the effect on its
activation energy was very weak, as shown in the small changes
of Tp2. Such TiO2 was found to consist of anatase and brookite phases,
with an average particle size of ~10 nm. The catalytic effect of TiO2
nanoparticles on low temperature decomposition (LTD) peak of AP
was probably due to the presence of the cations and anions on the
surface of the transition metal oxides, which act as an acid–base
site pairs and adsorb gaseous reactive molecules formed during the
LTD of AP [127].

Similar to additives for nitramines, the nanometal hydrates and
perovskite-type transition metal salts are also useful as an AP cat-
alyst. Magnesium-based hydrogen storage nanomaterials, Mg–H and
MgEr–H (Fig. 8a and 8b), were prepared by a DC arc plasma method,
followed by high-pressure hydrogenation [128]. It was revealed, in

Table 4, that the incorporation of erbium (Er) could effectively in-
crease the hydrogen absorption in Mg powder and reduce the
dehydriding temperature. The thermal decomposition behaviors of
AP in the presence of the Mg–H and MgEr–H nanomaterials were
investigated by simultaneous TG-DSC technique and the corre-
sponding parameters, which are listed in Table 4.

Regarding the perovskite-type metal salts, the regular cube-
shaped and single-phase spinel MnFe2O4 samples (Fig. 8c, 30 and
20 nm) were synthesized by co-precipitation phase-inversion and
low temperature combustion methods, respectively [129]. Another
group of perovskite-type oxides LaMO3 (M = Fe, Co, or Ni) were pre-
pared by a glycine combustion method using La(NO3)3 · 6H2O with
Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O and Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O with Ni(NO3)2 · 6H2O as the pre-
cursors and C2H5NO2 as the gelating agent [130]. The micrometer-
sized cobalt oxalates with different morphologies were prepared
(Fig. 8g–i). The effect of these catalysts on the thermal decompo-
sition of AP was evaluated and no significant differences were
observed [137]. As a comparison, the catalytic activities of nano oxa-
lates of Fe, Co, and Ni, synthesized by colloidal precipitation method,
were studied regarding decomposition and ignition delay of AP-
based compositions [131]. All the nano oxalates showed very high
activity as burning rate catalysts for AP-based propellants using HTPB
as the binder. CoC2O4.2H2O was found to be the best catalyst in terms
of lowering Tp of both AP and AP/HTPB propellant. All the above
mentioned catalytic effects are evaluated first by DSC method, cor-
responding parameters are compared in Table 4, where three typical
micron-sized energetic ionic ferrocene catalysts were selected out
of 16 for a further comparison and all of the ferrocene catalysts
showed relatively higher thermal stability, and they could stabi-
lize AP as well [138].

As shown in Table 3, the additions of nanometer Cu, Ni and Al
powders could lower the high decomposition temperature of AP by
130.2, 112.9 and 51.8 °C, respectively. It indicates that nanometer
metal powders have much better catalytic effect on the main exo-
thermic decomposition of AP than most of the metal oxides due to
easy going oxidation reactions of the metals. In general, the increase

of the nanometal contents would result in increase of the differ-
ence in peak temperature. For instance, with the increase of Ni
nanoparticles from 2 to 5 wt.%, the composition Tp of AP may be
decreased by 92–105 °C [139]. Of the three, nanometer Cu (nCu)
shows the best catalysis on accelerating the decomposition of AP,
followed by nanometer Ni (nNi) and Al (nAl), because nCu would
act not only as a metal fuel, but also as an efficient catalyst due to
formation of CuO during heating, which is better than NiO and
Al2O3. The Tp of AP does not change in the case of nAl due to inert
Al2O3 was produced. Meanwhile, the nCu could decrease the first
exothermic decomposition temperature Tp1 by 35.1 °C, while nNi and
nAl powders increased that by 3.9 and 5.9 °C, respectively (these
temperature differences could be simply calculated according to the
Tp1 values of the corresponding materials listed in Table 3). Only nCu
powder shows self-evident catalytic effect both on LTD of AP, while
nNi and nAl powders hinder it. In addition, the total DTA heat re-
leases of AP in the presence of nNi, nCu and nAl are 1320, 1200 and
903 J g−1, respectively (see Table 3). These are much higher than that
of pure AP, indicating that a large amount of heat was generated
during oxidation of nanometals by thermolysis products of AP. It
can be noticed from Table 3 that the second exothermic Tp of AP is
decreased by 140.4 °C in presence of nano NiCu (nNiCu) alloy powder,
which is more significant than that of either nNi or nCu powder. It
is obvious that the nNiCu powder has better catalytic activity for
decomposition of AP than pure nanometal powders. The inherent
thermal decomposition mechanism of AP was suggested by proton
transfer, which may be favored by the alloys. The EDS result showed
that the element ratio between Ni and Cu in NiCu powder was 1
to 4. The content of NiCu powder in AP-based propellant is about
5 wt.%, therefore the Ni or Cu is about 2.5 wt.%. Thus mutual inter-
action between Ni and Cu is probably during oxidation of nNiCu
powder, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity and higher heat
release [107,108]. Even the nNi is less energetic than nCu and nAl,
however, after adding the nNi, the two exothermic peaks of AP
changed to only one around 335–348 °C, and the original large exo-
thermic peak at 440 °C disappeared. It indicates that the significant

effect of Ni nanoparticles is on the decrease of the decomposition
temperature of AP. By comparing the dependence of particle size
and content of Ni particles on the catalytic effect of AP, one could
easily understand the inherent catalytic mechanism of nanometal
particles on the decomposition of AP. It is clear that the effect of
nNi with a smaller particle size (36 nm, 2%) is better than that of a
micrometric one. One has to keep in mind that the second peak tem-
perature of AP changes when it is in the range of 330–440 °C,
depending on the particle size, heating rate, the facility used, and
many other factors. The peak differences from different authors
should be based on their own results, where the systematical errors
are excluded.

As mentioned above, the effect of the nanometals and corre-
sponding metal oxides on the peak decomposition temperature of
AP may be very close, but the heat releases are very different. The
comparison of the catalytic effect for nNi (36 nm, 2%) and nNiO
(10 nm, 3%) [140,141] indicates that the catalytic process of nNi is
more complex when there is an increase in heat release due to
reactions from oxidation, but the nNi and nNiO can also decrease
the Tp of AP at the same level (92 vs. 93 °C). A comprehensive com-
parison on the decomposition of AP of different metal nanopowders,
such as Al, Fe, W, Ni, Cu, and Cu—Ni alloys, was also carried out
[142]. Similar to the abovementioned results, the nCuNi alloy has
the best catalytic effect, which could decrease the Tp of the high-
temperature decomposition (HTD) of AP by 161 °C. Moreover, both
low and high Tp values were significantly changed with the addi-
tion of cobalt nanocrystals [143]. Irrespective of the shapes of the
cobalt, two decomposition peaks of the pure AP changed into one
decomposition peak when put under the influence of cobalt. More-
over, the starting temperature for the decomposition of AP was
decreased drastically while the peak temperature for the decom-
position of AP-based composites decreased in the order of ball-like

(316.3 °C), cauliflower-like (311.6 °C), and snowflake-like (284.3 °C)
cobalt. Interestingly, if the metal particles were introduced to carbon
nanomaterials such as CNTs and graphene oxide (GO), the heat
release and catalytic efficiency could be improved. It was reported
that in the presence of nCu/CNT composite particles the Tp of
the HTD of AP decreased by 126.3 °C, while the peak of the LTD
disappeared. Compared with the mechanical mixture of nCu and
CNTs, the Tp of the HTD of AP/Cu-CNT nanocomposites was de-
creased by 11.4 °C. Compared with nCu, the Tp of the HTD of AP-
Cu/CNT nanocomposite was 20.9 °C lower. This means that the
catalytic activity of nCu on the thermal decomposition of AP can
be further improved by combining it with CNTs. When compared
to nCu, the Cu/UDD nanocomposites are more effective catalysts
for AP decomposition. Cu/UDD nanocomposites could decrease the
higher Tp value of its HTD by 119 °C. The corresponding decompo-
sition heat was improved from 590 to 1400 J g−1, when 2 wt.% of
the Cu/UDD nanocomposites was used. Similarly, under the same
condition, the nNi/CNTs possess better catalytic performance and
positive synergistic effect than either of the components CNTs
and nNi.

In addition to metal particles, the effects of many kinds of metal
oxides have been applied to AP-based compositions. The thermal
decomposition properties of AP under the effects of these nanometal
oxides are compared in terms of DSC parameters (Table 4). In par-
ticular, as the most widely used nanometal oxides for AP, the nFe2O3
has very high SSA, a large number of atoms and oxygen vacancies
on its surface, which enable it to act as an excellent catalyst. It has
been shown that the thermal decomposition of AP could be en-
hanced with the increase of nFe2O3 additive. The Fe2O3 particles
(3.5 nm) showed a pronounced effect on lowering the HTD Tp of AP
by 40 °C (0.5 wt.%), 35 °C (1 wt.%), 59 °C (2 wt.%) and 77 °C (5 wt.%).
Such a significant reduction is attributed to the presence of a large

number of active sites with higher SSA for Fe2O3. The Tp of AP would
decrease with the reducing particle size (e.g. from 30 to 3.5 nm) at
0.5, 1, and 2 wt.% compositions. It was found that the HTD Tp of AP
with nFe2O3 contents of 1, 2, and 3 wt.% are 403.6, 374.2, and 347.9 °C,

respectively [129]. Only when the content of Fe2O3 is above 5 wt.%,
with decrease in particle size, the effect in peak temperature was
reversely changed from 373 °C (30 nm) to 390 °C (3.5 nm). In
addition, when 2 wt.% Fe2O3 (3.5 nm) was used, the optimum

high-heat release was observed at 4574 J g−1, in comparison to pure
AP at 834 J g−1, which is the highest value that has been achieved
so far with a nanometal oxide catalyst. As previously stated, a heat
release of 1320 kJ g−1 for nNi particles (30 nm) was obtained, which
is only 30% of the highest heat release among mixtures of AP with
nanometal oxides. In general, with the addition of 2 wt.% to 5 wt.%
of nanometal particles, the decomposition heat of AP increases by
70–80%, indicating that more exothermic chemical reactions oc-
curred between the nano additives and the thermolysis products
of AP.

Instead of simple mixtures of AP and metal oxides, the nCuO/AP
composite and corresponding propellants have decomposition Tp
values that are 25 °C and 8.6 °C lower than the simple mixture of
AP and nCuO, as well as their propellants, respectively. Comparing
to the mechanical mixed propellant containing nCuO, the heat of
combustion and explosion with nCuO/AP composite was increased
to about 1400 and 1700 J g−1, respectively [118]. In contrast, the nano-
sized copper chromite (nCuCr2O4) has much better catalytic effects,
if compared to its bulk size analog, which results in much lower HTD
Tp of AP and extremely high heat releases of 5430 J g−1. This is even
higher than the AP-based composition that contains 2 wt.% of Fe2O3
(3.5 nm). It was further shown that an AP-based composition with
nCuCr2O4 has a lower Tp value and a higher decomposition heat than
that of one containing nCuO, which has a heat release 3921 J g−1.
Similar to nCuCr2O4, the nano MnFe2O4 particles in single-phase and
uniform spinel states were prepared with average particle sizes of
about 30 and 20 nm. They were stable until 524 °C and could also
be used as additives for AP-based compositions. Under the effects
of these two additives, the HTD Tp of AP was decreased by 77.3 and
84.9 °C, respectively, while the apparent decomposition heat was
increased by 482.5 and 574.3 J g−1. The catalytic mechanism could
be explained by the favorable electron transfer space provided by
outer d orbit of transition metal ions and the high specific surface
absorption effect of nMnFe2O4 particles [129], which might also be
the case for nCuCr2O4. Therefore, both MnFe2O4 samples show better
catalytic performance with the thermal decomposition of AP, as com-
pared to nanometal Ni, nanoalloy NiB, as well as nFe2O3. In addition
to Mn and Cu salts, the nanometer La salts are also promising al-
ternatives as catalytic additives for thermal decomposition of AP
and combustion of AP-based propellants. It was found that the order
of their catalytic performance on AP thermal decomposition is
LaCoO3 > LaNiO3 > LaFeO3. By adding 2 wt.% of LaCoO3 nanocrystals
to AP, the decomposition temperature would decrease by 134 °C,
while the heat of decomposition would increase by 800 J g−1 [130].
As a novel attempt, several more complex metal salts have been
prepared and used as catalysts in the thermolysis of AP [114]. Under
their effects, the HTD peak temperature of AP was decreased by
20–36 °C (Table 4). The catalytic activity was found to be in the fol-
lowing order: nCoZnFe2O4 > nCoNiFe2O4 > nCuFe2O4 > nCuCoFe2O4 >
nNiCuFe2O4 > nNiZFe2O4. Regarding the abovementioned hydrogen
storage nanomaterials, both Mg—H and MgEr—H would promote
the thermal decomposition of AP, and in particular, the Tp of HTD
could be decreased by 80 °C. The decomposition heat of AP was in-
creased to twice the original AP, with a much faster reaction rate
[128]. It is believed that the “self-crushing and self-distribution” that
occurred within the decomposition reaction is responsible for the
improvement of the overall catalytic activities. In this process, both
catalysts and reactants have been crushed and the intermediate prod-
ucts were automatically uniformly distributed. This fact may also
interpret the thermal decomposition mechanism of AP under the
effects of oxalates [137].

As shown above, the carbon nanomaterials can be used to
enhance the activity of nanometal fuels. In fact, they can also be
combined with nanometal oxides and pure carbon nanomaterials
such as CNTs, which also have great catalytic activity on the de-
composition of AP-based compositions, where the decomposition

rate has been promoted above its onset temperature [144]. Graphene,
a 2-D carbon crystal with monoatomic thickness, is considered to
be a basic structural unit of fullerenes, CNTs, and graphite. It also
has a large SSA and can form complexes with energetic molecules.
For instance, a large amount of AP particles, with an average par-
ticle size of 69.4 nm, could be attached to the skeleton of graphene.
The elemental analysis of this material shows that the content of
AP can reach 94%, which is very promising for a main energetic
component [145]. Based on AP/GA nanocomposites, a novel GA/
Fe2O3/AP nanostructured energetic material was further prepared
by a sol–gel method followed by a supercritical CO2 drying tech-
nique. It has been demonstrated that Fe2O3 and AP are well dispersed
in GA layers on a nanometer scale, where Fe2O3 exhibits a cata-
lytic effect on thermal decomposition of AP with an HTD peak
temperature decrease of 58.2 °C. In contrast, the graphene-based
nanometal particles are even better on this issue. The Ni/graphene
nanocomposites could be prepared via a one-step mixing method
[146]. We found that when the content of Ni/graphene
nanocomposites is 1 wt.%, the catalytic effect on decomposition of
AP will be the most significant, resulting in the HTD Tp decrease of
97.3 °C. The same method was used to prepare graphene/Mn3O4
nanoparticles, which also has a significant catalytic effect on AP
decompositions [147]. Again, two of its decomposition peaks merged
into one, with Tp being reduced by 141.9 °C due to synergies of
Mn3O4 and graphene. As a homolog of graphene, graphene oxide
(GO) has more functional groups on its surface. It is easier to combine
it with the other substances, extending the range of its applica-
tions. It was reported that the CuO/GO nanocomposites prepared
from water/isopropanol solvent were very effective in catalyzing
the decomposition and combustion reactions of AP [148]. In addi-
tion, when some energetic functional groups were introduced to
GO, the catalytic activity could be further improved. For instance,
the nitrated GO could make the decomposition Tp of AP decrease
by 106 °C, while causing the heat of decomposition to increase from
875 to 3236 J g−1 [149].

In addition to graphene and graphene oxide (GO), a large number
of hematite-phase Fe2O3 could be uniformly filled in the multi-
walled CNTs (MWCNTs), where the mass fraction of Fe2O3 was about
25.8 wt.% [150]. In the presence of 10 wt.% Fe2O3/MWCNTs com-
posites, the second Tp of AP was decreased by 116 °C, with
decomposition heat increase of 200 kJ mol−1. Alternatively, the NiO/
CNT composite particles could be prepared by a direct chemical
deposition method [151]. It was shown that the NiO/CNT
nanocomposites (nNiO/CNTs = 1/4) could decrease the HTD Tp of AP
and AP/HTPB propellant by 92.24 and 42.2 °C, while increasing the
total apparent heat of decomposition by 1086 and 730 J g−1, respec-
tively. Due to the unique tubular structure and support function of
CNTs, NiO/CNT composite particles show better catalytic activities
than pure NiO. Similarly, the Co3O4/CNT nanocomposites were pre-
pared by chemical deposition method [152,153], where the catalytic
performances of the pure nanometer particles (NiO, Co3O4, CNTs)
and composites (NiO/CNTs, Co3O4/CNTs) on thermal decomposi-
tion of AP and HTPB/AP propellants were compared. It shows that
the NiO/CNT and Co3O4/CNT composite particles possess uniform
coating and large SSA. The catalysis of Co3O4/CNT nanocomposites
are the most significant, making HTD Tp of AP and HTPB propel-
lants decrease by 153.1 and 60.0 °C, while the total apparent
decomposition heat increases by 1163 and 920 J g−1, respectively.
Compared with NiO/CNTs, Co3O4/CNTs, the inclusion of Co—Al mixed
metal oxides (CoAl-MMO) and CoAl-MMO/CNT to AP may make the
latter decompose in a single exothermic process. In the case of CoAl-
MMO, AP showed a maximum peak temperature of 297 °C.
Surprisingly, when using CoAl-MMO/CNT, the second peak tem-
perature of AP significantly decreased to 271 °C [154]. This means
that this metal–carbon nanocomposite is the most efficient addi-
tive to promote the decomposition of the AP.

2.2. Catalytic effects on decomposition kinetics

2.2.1. Decomposition kinetics of RDX, HMX and their propellants

Solid-state reactions of composite energetic materials are in many
cases complex and may involve several overlapping processes. De-
termining the kinetic analysis of such solid-state reactions is
challenging, as far as the kinetic parameters of each individual process,
including activation energy (Ea), pre-exponential factor (A), and kinetic
model (f(α)), which should be determined in order for a complete
kinetic description of the overall reaction to be representative.
However, a large number of analytical methods are available for de-
termining the kinetic parameters of discrete solid-state reactions,
but the kinetic calculation methods for the analysis of complex pro-
cesses are very limited. Non-isothermal kinetics for crystallization,
curing, and reactions has been a research topic for more than half
a century. This is because non-isothermal kinetics involves an equa-
tion termed Arrhenius equation [155], which states that the reaction
rate constant is an exponential function, negative of the activation
energy, divided by the product of the gas constant and tempera-
ture. From the slope of the Kissinger plot [155], one in turn obtains
the activation energy, Ea; further from the intercept one obtains the
pre-exponential factor, A, as well. There have been many more ac-
curate methods developed that should be used to determine the
kinetic parameters [156], which will not be presented here in detail

due to space limitations. The kinetic parameters are very impor-
tant for EMs, because many other parameters for safety of EMs could
be calculated based on these kinetic parameters, such as shelf-life,
explosion delay, critical temperature, thermal stability threshold,
500-day cook-off temperature, and approximate time to explosion,
which can easily be calculated from the kinetic data [29].

The thermal decomposition kinetics of energetic materials, as
a very popular topic, has been evaluated by many researchers
[157,158]. As well-known energetic nitramines, RDX and HMX have
been intensively investigated in terms of their thermal decompo-
sition. The decomposition activation energy and mechanism are
reported with large discrepancies depending on the techniques and
experimental test conditions. The activation energies of RDX and
its mixtures are summarized in Table 5, which are taken from the
literature [159]. It has been shown that the decomposition activa-
tion energy in the solid-state is about 206 kJ mol−1 by TGA and 178–
225 kJ mol−1 by Russian Manometric Method (MM). It is reasonable
to assume that RDX decomposes much faster with lower activa-
tion energy when it is in a gaseous state [160]. It seems that the
organic solvents have little effect on the Ea of RDX except trinitro-
toluene, because it decomposes in the liquid state in both cases [161].
The polymer matrices could either increase the activation energy
or decrease it depending on the plasticizers, but the fluoropolymers
(Viton A and Fluorel) have little effect on that due to the absence

of plasticizers [162]. The mass loss of HMX at low heating rates in
an open cell is strongly affected by sublimation, and hence the lower
heating rate is also limited by TGA experiments. Due to the burning
and sublimation effect within the applied interval of heating rates,
the kinetic parameters for the materials of HMX-C4, HMX-Formex
P1, and HMX-Semtex 10 cannot be considered to have a physically
meaningful interpretation. One can notice that the decomposition
activation energy for pure HMX should be in the vicinity of 221–
228 kJ.mol−1 according to DSC and Russian MM [163–168]. It is much
higher than that of RDX, because HMX decomposes in the solid state,
where the stabilization of its crystal lattice is responsible for a higher
energy barrier. When HMX decomposes isothermally in a vacuum
environment, the activation energy is greatly dependent on the tem-
perature [163]. At lower temperatures, the decomposition rate is
considerably lower than that of higher temperatures, where sub-
limation plays a dominant role, resulting in underestimated activation
energy of about 101–150 kJ mol−1. The effect of the contact mate-
rials on the decomposition kinetics of RDX can be significant
depending on the nature of the contacted materials.

As mentioned above, the materials that can dissolve RDX or in-
teract with the gaseous products of RDX may have great effects
on its decomposition kinetic parameters. Different from the
abovementioned contact materials, the nano-sized additives have
more potential to interact with RDX and HMX, resulting in very dif-
ferent decomposition peak temperatures and heat releases
(Tables 1–4), while the kinetic parameters are also greatly changed
(Tables 6 and 7). Due to very limited data on the decomposition
kinetic parameters of RDX and HMX under the influence of
nanoadditives, any comparison made can only be very primitive;
also, limited nanomaterials were used for measurements. The kinetic
parameters listed in Tables 6 and 7 are based on the TGA data, where
the average activation energy for liquid state decomposition of RDX
is about 171–174 kJ mol−1, following a first order reaction model.
As mentioned above, the Ea values that are less than 160 kJ mol−1
or above 190 kJ mol−1 probably correspond to the gaseous state and
solid-state decomposition of RDX.

As shown in Table 6, the decomposition reaction model of
pure RDX is very close to F1 (first-order chemical reaction). Under
the effect of polymer matrices, the reaction model shifts to an

auto-accelerated model with a more or less longer induction period,
depending on the polymer matrix. The polymer matrices contain-
ing mineral oil materials and plasticizers (Formex P1, Semtex, and
C4) present an almost similar effect, making the beginning of RDX
decomposition follow kinetic model R3, which corresponds to
phase boundary controlled reaction (contracting volume, with
f(α) = 3(1 − α)2/3). In the case of highly thermostable fluoroelastomer
(Viton A and Fluorel, which have influence as inert liquids), they
could stabilize RDX by hindering its evaporation thereby prevent-
ing the decomposition products from escaping. Therefore, they could
change the decomposition mechanism from the F1 model to what
appears to be a two-dimensional Avrami–Erofeev nucleation and
growth model [169]. For pure RDX, as mentioned in the last section,
its initial stage of decomposition in closed pans has activation energy
of 206 kJ mol−1, which is consistent with the liquid phase RDX de-
composition [159]. Standard bond energy of an N—N bond is
38.4 kcal mol−1 (160.7 kJ.mol−1) while the energy of a C—N bond is
305.4 kJ mol−1. It means that homolysis of the N—N bond is a primary
fragmentation for RDX bonded by different polymers [169]. However,
the whole decomposition processes of RDX-Viton A and RDX-
Fluorel has almost identical activation energies of 170–174 kJ mol−1,
indicating liquid-phase decomposition under packing of these ther-
mally stable inert polymers. It was shown that the thermal
decomposition processes of RDX could be divided into three stages
according to the TG curves: a molten stage, a thermal decomposi-
tion stage, and an end stage. Therefore, the Ea should be very
dependent on the extent of conversion. All the Ea mentioned above
reach their average value at their peak temperature. The activation
energies of RDX were found to be in the range of 124.3–181.5 kJ mol−1
in the thermal decomposition stage of non-monotonously increas-
ing reaction rate [170]. The activation energy of RDX is 140 kJ·mol−1
in the molten stage (liquid phase), and 167.2 kJ·mol−1 in the thermal
decomposition stage. In open pans, evaporation is a prevalent process
with activation energy of ~100 kJ mol−1. Confining the system in either
a pierced pan or a closed pan promotes liquid state decomposition
of RDX that occurs with Ea of ~200 kJ mol−1, which suggests scission
of an N—N bond as the primary decomposition step [171].

Unfortunately, the physical models for decomposition of RDX
under the effects of nanoadditives are not available in the literature

Q.-L. Yan et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 57 (2016) 75–136

and could not be compared with those under the effects of
polymeric binders. Regardless of this lack of information, the
nanoadditives could greatly change the decomposition Ea of RDX.
The nPbO · CuO/CNTs has the most significant catalytic effect among
all listed materials, which makes the Ea decrease to around
100 kJ mol−1. In contrast, the nanodiamond coating can either in-
crease or decrease the energy barrier for RDX decomposition,
depending on the thickness of the coating. If the contents of the
nanodiamond were too high it would hinder the decomposition of
RDX, resulting in higher activation energy. Therefore, in most cases,
the content of the additives for catalytic decomposition or com-
bustion should be limited to a maximum of 3% for an improved
performance. It was also shown that CuFe2O4-p and CuFe2O4-d ex-
hibited better catalytic activity than the fullerene derivatives because
the apparent Ea values for RDX decomposition were reduced by 37.7
and 28.4 kJ mol−1, respectively. For FEN, the corresponding Ea was
decreased by 17 kJ mol−1 while that of HMX was reduced by more
than 20 kJ mol−1. In addition to the effect of nanoadditives on de-
composition Ea of RDX, the particle sizes of RDX crystal also have
a significant influence on the decomposition kinetics. As the par-
ticle size of RDX is increased, the Tp of RDX and the decomposition
Ea are increased. The Ea values for micron sized RDX are 1.5 times
higher than that of nano-RDX [172]. Under the effects of the other
nitrocompounds such as TNT, during the initial reaction step, the
N—N bond cleavage, in the decomposition stage of RDX, would have
a higher energy barrier [173]. As listed in Table 6, the rate con-
stants for decomposition of pure RDX are about 7.55 × 1021 by TGA
and 1.46 × 1017 by DSC at the temperature of 200 °C, which is close
to its melting point. The pre-exponential factor determined by TG
experiments is much higher than that obtained by DSC experi-
ments due to the evaporation of RDX in the early stage of RDX
decomposition in open pans, especially when under a lower heating
rate. The inclusion of inert stable materials (e.g. fluoropolymers) on
the surface of RDX crystal or a combination of nanomaterials may
decrease this evaporation effect, resulting in a much lower activa-
tion energy and rate constant, at the same temperature, if the
decomposition mechanism does not change. However, some
nanoadditives such as FHN and nAl would increase the rate con-
stant while decreasing the activation energy for the RDX
decomposition, which does not follow the rule of kinetic compen-
sation effects [174], due to the change in decomposition mechanisms.
Because these materials do not only act as catalysts, they could

undergo chemical changes during the decomposition of RDX. The
kinetic compensation effects for all involved materials will be dis-
cussed separately in a later section.

Generally, the decomposition kinetics for RDX and HMX par-
ticles derived from TG and DSC experiments assume simple reaction
mechanisms in homogeneous materials. Since the overall content
provided by these methods is limited, it is impossible to deconvolve
the effects of physical and morphological changes that occur in these
materials as they decompose or to understand the effect these
changes may have on the chemical reaction mechanisms and the
overall rates of reaction from the data. In particular, the decompo-
sition of HMX would be more complicated due to phase transition
and the stabilization of the crystal lattice during its solid-state de-
composition. Nucleation-growth kinetic expressions are derived from
the thermal decomposition of HMX from a variety of data, includ-
ing mass loss for isothermal and constant heating rates in an open
pan and heat flows for isothermal and constant heating rates in open
and closed pans [175]. Due to strong self-heating and sublimation
during the decomposition of HMX, the runaway chemical reaction
could easily be obtained under a slightly higher heating rate or a
larger sample mass, while the decomposition mechanism would be
greatly dependent on the heating rate during TGA experiments.
Therefore, the experimental conditions should be well controlled
in order for reliable kinetic parameters, which typically means tem-
peratures less than 255 °C for isothermal and heating rates less than
1 °C min−1.

When using this method with an open pan experiment the rea-
sonable activation energies are typically in the range of 140–
165 kJ mol−1, while for sealed-pan experiments they are about 150–
165 kJ mol−1 [176,177]. Such values lie in the middle of the values
given in a compensation-law plot by Brill et al. [174]. In addition,
it was shown that the kinetic parameters for heat release and mass
loss are not the same, because they measure different processes, and
that the heat release kinetics depends on the nature of the sample
confinement, which influences the extent of secondary reactions
involving gaseous products. Finally, we show that based on an ad-
ditional comparison to lower temperature decomposition work by
Behrens and Bulusu [176] and Burnham et al. [178] the global ac-
tivation energy for HMX decomposition is probably about
165 kJ mol−1 for a reaction extent of 10%. In Table 7, for decompo-
sition of HMX, the Ea values that are larger than 300 kJ mol−1 are
most likely due to improper experimental conditions used for data

collections. The kinetic parameters, especially the physical models
under the effect of nanomaterials, are very limited when com-
pared to the number of nanomaterials used in HMX-based
compositions listed in Table 2.

In general, under the effect of nanomaterials, the Ea of HMX was
greatly decreased. Particularly, then PbSnO3 and nLaOCl have an
equivalent effect on thermal decomposition kinetics of HMX, re-
sulting in the same kinetic model and close activation energy
(Table 7). The carbon nanomaterials are also effective in decreas-
ing the energy barrier of HMX decomposition. It was shown that
FHN can accelerate the decomposition of RDX and HMX. The peak
temperatures of the exothermic decomposition are then reduced
and corresponding Ea of RDX is decreased by 17 kJ mol−1, and that
of HMX is reduced by more than 20 kJ mol−1 [75]. Moreover, the de-
composition of HMX/CNTs composites showed that the CNTs may
reduce decomposition Ea by more than 70 kJ mol−1 when only 1.0
wt.% of CNTs was included, resulting in a much higher decompo-
sition rate [90]. As shown in Table 7, the copper nanoparticles would
also decrease the Ea for the decomposition of HMX by 31–33 kJ mol−1
regardless of the experimental conditions by different authors. Such
a decline would lead to the pre-pyrolysis of HMX. LaMnO3 can ob-
viously reduce Ea of HMX decomposition to a greater extent than
LaOCl powder. This may be due to its catalytic activity on the ox-
idation reaction of CO and the reaction between CO and NO during
HMX thermal decomposition [85].

The rate constant for HMX decomposition in a solid state should
be in the range of 7.23 × 1011 and 6.50 × 1017 at 230 °C, which is below
its onset temperature for decomposition. Under the effect of
nanomaterials, the rate constant is greatly decreased if the data of
HMX from the same authors are used as a reference value. More-
over, “Effect of spatial distribution” of catalyst is presented based
on the analysis of the nano-sized Cu catalytic mechanism. It was
proposed that the highest value of correlation coefficient and the
lowest value of standard deviation are obtained for f(α) = 1/2α2 for
the early stages of HMX thermal decomposition. Hence, early stages
of HMX thermal decomposition are controlled by the sublimation
of HMX or adsorption and desorption of the gaseous products from
HMX thermal decomposition [176]. The reaction model does not
change for the thermal decomposition of HMX with LaOCl powder
mixture when the fractional mass loss α is in the range of 1–10%,
following a power low model 1/2α2. The use of LaMnO3 would make
HMX decomposition follow a F1 model, while with nBi2WO6 and
PbSnO3 follow a nucleation growth model. On the other hand, one
could state that the self-heating process could be mitigated by the
dilution of non-energetic nano additives, and the mitigation effect
would be increased with increase of the additives’ contents (Fig. 9).
It was found that for a given nano-oxide, increasing its concentration

in the mixture with HMX results in enlargement of the influence
on nitramine thermolysis [88].

A comparative study on the influence of different oxides at a given
content (3 wt.%) on the HMX thermal decomposition has also been
reported in the same paper, where the fraction reacted for HMX
achieved 40%. The same catalytic effect could be obtained when
3 wt.% of nTiO2 or 20 wt.% of nFe2O3 was added. At the heating rate
of 10 °C min−1, the onset temperature of HMX decomposition could
be decreased to 170 °C with nTiO2. The lowering of this tempera-
ture was observed as well as for the other nano-oxides. Their catalytic
efficiency in descending order is: TiO2 > Fe2O3 ≈ Al2O3 > SiO2 > others
[88], where the other oxides have little effect on the initial decom-
position behavior of HMX.

2.2.2. Decomposition kinetics of AP and AP-based propellants

Similar to RDX and HMX, the TGA and DSC methods have been
used to study the thermal decomposition of AP by many authors.
There are at least two decomposition steps for AP, which may be
changed into one step by using some of the nano additives as stated
in Section 2.1.3. The advanced isoconversional method deter-
mined the dependency of Eα on α for isothermal and non-isothermal
decompositions of AP by TGA experiments [179]. It was shown that
below the conversion of 10%, the Eα dependencies obtained from
isothermal and non-isothermal data are similar. The initial decom-
position Ea is about 90 kJ mol−1 for the isothermal and 130 kJ mol−1
for the non-isothermal decomposition below its onset tempera-
ture. In the end of the reaction, the Eα for the isothermal and non-
isothermal conditions was increased to ~110 and ~130 kJ mol−1,
respectively, which are then assigned to the Ea of sublimation. The
difference in Ea with varying conditions could be explained by two
rate-limiting steps, which are nucleation and nuclei growth for
isothermal and non-isothermal conditions, respectively. The de-
composition behavior and kinetics of AP were found to be pressure
dependent [180]. It was revealed that the thermal behaviors of cata-
lyzed and non-catalyzed decompositions of AP were different. The
catalysts could promote the secondary gas-phase reactions by ni-
trogen and surface reactions on the nanocatalyst. The oxidation
reactions were presumably enhanced, leading to different decom-
position behaviors of AP under different pressure conditions.

As shown in Table 8, the nano-sized Cu, Ni, Al, and NiCu powders
could decrease the Ea of the HTD of AP by 22, 10, 5, and 23 kJ mol−1,
respectively, indicating that these nanoadditives can easily facili-
tate the thermal decomposition process of AP at higher temperatures
[105]. The nCu and nNiCu powders can also decrease the Ea of AP
at LTD, while nNi and nAl powders will increase it [106]. In con-
trast, the DTA experiments showed that the micron-sized metal
powders can also decrease the second peak temperature of AP,

showing good catalytic activity, but their effects are far less than
those of the corresponding nanopowders. In the mixture of AP and
nanometal powders, the latter was mostly absorbed on the surface
of AP particles due to their much smaller average size and larger
SSA. The content of the nanometals also has a great effect on de-
composition temperature and the amount of heat release of AP
decompositions, as mentioned in Section 2.1.3, which would change
the decomposition mechanism to metal fuel oxidation by the gaseous
products from AP decomposition. It was proposed that the inher-
ent mechanism of nNi powders on decomposition process of AP
could be attributed as the combination of a bridge site and
deinhibition effects [106–108].

The most probable functions of the thermal decomposition re-
action for AP and AP/nNi could both be described by the Avrami–
Erofeev equations. It was suggested that the decomposition of AP
started from a topochemical reaction [181], where the electron trans-
fer leads to initial dissociation of AP into NH3 and HClO4. The LTD
of AP crystals originates from the reaction between NH3 and HClO4
that is adsorbed on its surface, resulting in the cracking of the crys-
tals and an increase in reaction sites. At higher temperatures, the
reactions are mainly due to desorption of NH3. Under the effect of
nanoadditives, the LTD could not be realized due to strong adsorp-
tion of NH3 on the surface of these nano particles. The catalytic effect

of nNi and other nanometals occurs in the gas phase, where the
highly reactive nNi powders are involved in the redox reactions and
the following cyclization, resulting in higher decomposition rate of
AP. On the other hand, with the inclusion of Ni-based nanoadditives,
the number of nuclear sites was greatly increased due to the pres-
ence of several defects on the surface of nNi. One could notice from
Table 7 that, under the effect of nNi, the physical model of the AP
decomposition changes from 3-D nucleation to 2-D nucleation, in-
dicating a higher concentration of nuclei. In contrast, under the effect
of nAl, the heat release increases greatly, but the catalytic effect is
not so significant, resulting in very close peak temperature and ac-
tivation energy (177 vs. 172 kJ mol−1) [105]. Regarding the metal salts,
the reported Ea values for AP and mixtures of AP with nano oxa-
lates are 101.1, 67.6, 61.2, and 67.1 kJ mol−1. It has been shown that
the rate-controlling step for thermal decomposition of AP/nCoCO4
is the power law, and it is 3D diffusion for AP/nFeCO4 and AP/
nNiCO4 [130]. Regarding the Fe2O3, the increase in content and
particle size would result in a lower Ea for AP decompositions. The
dependencies of Ea on the extent of conversion for AP and several
of its mixtures with nanoadditives are shown in Fig. 10.

To approximate the curve associated with the inclusion of nAl
particles, the first step is from 0 to 7%, where the Ea is between
130 and 200 kJ mol−1, and the second step is from 7% to 17% with

and co-workers, and Bulusu and Behrens have focused research on
thermal decomposition mechanisms of EMs, and special attention
was paid to nitramine explosives [174,177]. The development of so-
called T-Jump-FTIR (Temperature-Jump-Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy) hyphenated techniques to simulate rapid heating
under combustion conditions [182,183] by using a variety of thermal
decomposition of energetic compounds and their compositions at
different pressures was studied. Detailed decomposition mecha-
nisms and corresponding kinetic parameters have been determined.
In addition to the T-Jump-FTIR technique, researchers are using
various other techniques, such as three quadrupole mass spectrom-
eter (TQMS), two-dimensional fluorescence excited spectrum, PLIF
photographic spectrum, and UV–visible absorption spectrum coupled
with a spontaneous Raman TOF mass spectrometry analysis to
analyze the gas-phase products during decomposition or in com-
bustion flames [184]. Development of analytical techniques improved
the data quality for the thermal decomposition mechanisms of EMs.
Solid propellant combustion is a condensed-phase and gas-phase
chemical reaction based on a complex multi-stage process. If there
is no information about these chemical reactions, it is impossible
to establish an accurate model to estimate burning rates and per-
formances of solid propellants. According to the molecular structure,
although the gaseous decomposition products of HMX and RDX are
similar, the ways that their condensed phases and pathways change
are different.

For thermal decomposition of nitramines, at present, it is a gen-
erally accepted idea that nitro groups represent the primary cause
of initiating reactivity of polynitro compounds. In this respect, the
initiation by heat, especially low-temperature decompositions below
600 K, has been the most frequently studied topic so far (see Refs.
[185–191] and related citations). It turned out that the primary frag-
mentation mechanism in these conditions is entirely different from
the low-temperature variant. In the case of the RDX uni-molecular
decomposition, it can be stated that the elimination of the NO2 group
by homolysis of one N—N bond is observed for all reaction condi-
tions, whereas triazinane ring fission (depolymerization to 1-nitro-
1-azaethylene) is the predominant reaction in the gas-phase thermal
decomposition of this nitramine, i.e. at higher temperatures. Ho-
molytic splitting of N—NO2 bond is typical of secondary nitramines
[185,186,188,189,191–194]. According to Korsoonskii et al. [195],
planar nitramino groups are connected with higher Ea values of ther-
molysis with the corresponding compounds, when compared with
thermolysis of nitramines containing pyramidal nitramino groups.
The chemical pathways for decomposition of RDX in the vapor and
solution phase are different. Understanding the difference in product
distribution of decompositions of RDX in both phases facilitates our
understanding of other differences in their decomposition schemes.
In all nitramines, the trigger linkage appears to be N—N ho-
molysis as mentioned above. In the decomposition solution, the
amine radical is stabilized sufficiently so that it resists further de-
composition and instead reacts with NO to form nitrosamine [196].
However, in vapor or condensed phase decomposition, the amine
radical breaks down further before the lost NO2 can return as the
reduced NO, resulting in a little nitrosamine to be formed. In the
case of RDX, the loss of only one NO2 group triggers the break-
down of the entire heterocycle. In monofunctional nitramines, N—N
bond scission means the most likely fate of each nitrogen atom is
the formation of nitrous oxide (N2O) and eventually nitrogen gas.
In RDX and HMX, once the first N—N bond is broken, the rest of the
heterocycle can unravel, and the extra nitramine functionalities form
nitrous oxide rather than nitrogen gas. In the solution, the decom-
position gases are predominately dinitrogen, and more nitrosamine
is observed because the amine radical remaining after initial NO2
loss can be stabilized by the inert solvent, preventing further un-
raveling of the ring. This has been proven by the previous labeling
experiments with neat HMX [197,198] and RDX [199] showing no

Ea between 130 and 160 kJ mol−1. The last step is from 17% to
the end with the activation energy of 120−160 kJ mol−1. The
first step can be described by a 1st order autocatalysis with
f(α) = (1 − α)(1 + Katα), where Kat is the autocatalytic order. The second
is 1-D diffusion reaction with f(α) = 1/α−1. The third step follows a
second order chemical reaction model (1 − α)2 with a relatively lower
Ea than the first two steps. If we compare the effect of several rare
earth metal oxides on the decomposition Ea of AP, one could notice
that they almost have the same effect on that in the initial step of
AP decomposition, and the trend of Ea is very close to that of nAl,
but it is much lower than that of nAl. The most proper physical
models for the AP with CeO2, Pr2O3, and Nd2O3 prove the conten-
tion that their rate limiting steps in thermal decomposition may be
1-D for CeO2, and 3-D diffusion for the other two. Meanwhile, it was
shown that the ignition delay depends exponentially on tempera-
ture, which could be used to calculate the ignition Ea as well. The
process of ignition can never be treated as a steady-state process,
since it is a transient process before sustained combustion. However,
the calculated Ea values for ignition of AP under the effect of
nanoadditives are greatly decreased similar to the Ea for thermal
decomposition. The Ea values for ignition can normally decrease from
40–49 kJ mol−1 to 22–30 kJ mol−1, while the value of Ea for AP/
HTPB decreases from 37.7 to 21–28 kJ mol−1. In comparison, the nNi-
Co, CeO2 and nCoCO4 are the best additives in promoting the
ignitability of AP, among groups of metals, metal oxides, and metal
salts, respectively. The decrease in Ea and increase in the rate con-
stant indicate the effectiveness of the catalytic process. Also, the
catalyzed propellant is easy to ignite and the most reactive of all
the nano-sized additives [125]. If we compare the rate constant ob-
tained for ignition and decomposition at the same temperature, one
could see that the rate of decomposition is much higher at the tem-
perature of 300 °C, where the rate constant for ignition of pure AP
is much lower, meaning that ignition would be very difficult to occur
at this temperature, as already proved by the ignition experiments.

2.3. The catalytic decomposition mechanisms

2.3.1. Catalytic decomposition of RDX and HMX

For thermal decomposition mechanism of EMs, to determine the
gaseous and condensed phase products with a function of temper-
ature or time, a variety of new experimental methods have been
developed in recent years [122]. Since the 1990s, the pioneers, Brill

signal of N2O. The basic problem of defining the kinetics and mecha-
nisms of the thermal decomposition of EMs lies in the strong
dependency of the corresponding kinetic parameters on tempera-
ture, pressure, and construction materials in contact with the
decomposing samples [187]. It is well-known that thermal decom-
position of polynitro compounds in the gas-phase is faster than in
liquid state or their solution, which is again faster than those in solid-
state [195–200].

In the solid state, electrostatic interaction of molecules in the
crystal lattice changes the character of the bonds’ hybridization in
the given molecule in comparison with the situation of the iso-
lated molecule in the gas-state and/or within the solution. Regarding
the above-mentioned change of electronic structure, there is also
a negative influence to the tight fitting molecules in crystal lattice
accesses (i.e. negative influence on volume of activation). These facts,
together with the relatively low coefficients of thermal expansion
and compressibility, have a negative influence on the creation of
an activation complex during the thermal decomposition (i.e. tran-
sition state of decomposition) [201]. This effect is named the
“stabilizing effect of crystal lattice” [186]. Reactions of the thermal
decomposition in “volume” are thus limited by the existence of
defects (dislocations) in the given crystal: a creation from the re-
action centers on the surface of crystals is preferred. Another
important characteristic of the thermal decomposition in the solid-
state is a progressive surface liquefaction as a result of the
decomposition products created and subsequent dissolving of the
original crystals in them [185,202]. The above stated factors would

be the main influences that cause the differences between RDX and
HMX decomposition mechanisms.

Recently, through the use of simultaneous TG modulated beam
mass spectrometry, optical microscopy, hot-stage time-lapsed mi-
croscopy, and SEM measurements, the physical and chemical
processes that control the thermal decomposition of RDX below its
melting point (160 to 189 °C) have been identified [203]. Two gas-
phase reactions of RDX are predominant during the early stages of
the experiment. One involves the loss of HONO and HNO and leads
to the formation of H2O, NO, NO2, and oxy-s-triazine (OST) or
s-triazine. The other involves the reaction of NO with RDX to form
NO2 and 1-nitroso-3,5-dinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (ONDNTA), which
subsequently decomposes to a set of products of which CH2O and
N2O are the most abundant (Fig. 11, Ps1–Ps4). The gas-phase de-
composition products of the RDX, such as ONDNTA, can deposit
themselves on the crystal surface, where a new set of reaction path-
ways are developed. During the initial decomposition stages
(Fig. 12b), the individual RDX particles could sinter and form a white,
opaque, rigid matrix.

The RDX particles lying beneath the sintered surface can be re-
covered, but still appear translucent and unaltered with no black
spots or orange patches growing on them (Fig. 12c). The initial surface
reactions would accumulate the greatest amount of products from
the gas-phase reactions, resulting in the development of an orange-
colored nonvolatile residue (NVR) on the surface of the RDX particles
(Fig. 12d). The NVR is most likely formed via the ONDNTA decom-
position on the surface. Reactions involving the NVR become

dominant during the later stage of the decomposition process, which
are specified in Fig. 11 (Ps3, Ps4). The ONDNTA may undergo rapid
loss of N2 and NO2 with the remaining portion of the molecule being
incorporated into the dynamic NVR (Fig. 11, Ps5). The dynamic NVR
also decomposes and leads to the formation of H2O, CH2O, N2O,
NH2CHO, (CH3)2NCHO, (CH3)2NNO, C2H2N2O, and (CH3)3N or
CH3NCH2CH3. The reactions between the NVR and RDX on the surface
can lead to the creation of a molten RDX layer where the liquid-
phase decomposition may occur. The combination of these reactions
can then accelerate the reaction rate in the later decomposition stage,
which has been referred to as autocatalytic in many previous studies
of RDX decomposition [204–206].

Based on the experimental results of decomposition mecha-
nisms of RDX, some initio DFT calculations and molecular dynamics
with reactive force field ReaxFF have been carried out to confirm
the inherent mechanism at an atomistic level [207,208]. For in-
stance, the computational results were compared and contrasted
with the previous experimental results for the decomposition of RDX
following electronic excitation [209]. One of the N—NO2 moieties
of the RDX molecule was considered to be an active site. The
nitronitrite isomerization was predicted to be a major excited-
electronic-state decomposition channel for the RDX molecule, which
occurs through a series of conical intersections (CIs) to produce
rotationally cold but vibrationally hot distributions of NO prod-
ucts (Fig. 13). This prediction directly corroborates previous
experimental results obtained through photofragmentation-
fragment detection techniques, which is in good agreement with
the experimental observation of rovibrational distributions of the
NO product (Fig. 11, Pg1). The ReaxFF simulations also showed that
the equilibrium population of CO and CO2 depend strongly on the
density. At lower densities, almost all carbon atoms formed CO mol-
ecules. As the density increases, larger aggregates of carbon appear,
leading to a C deficient gas-phase and a generation of CO2 mol-
ecules [210]. The equilibrium populations of N2 and H2O are more
insensitive with respect to density and form in the early stages of
the decomposition process with similar timescales. Regarding the
decomposition mechanisms of HMX, the results from STMBMS ex-
periments provided more information on this issue than standard

thermal analysis methods, allowing us to gain more insight into the
underlying processes [211]. Fig. 14 shows the identities and gas for-
mation rates (GFR) of products formed during the thermal
decomposition of HMX at 235 °C and the corresponding morphol-
ogy changes of a single HMX particle. The main decomposition
products were found to contain CH2O, NO, N2O, H2O, and CO. Note
the unusual variation in the temporal behaviors of the GFRs for the
products in this isothermal experiment. After the sample reaches
235 °C, there is an induction period, where the formation rate of
the gaseous products is relatively slow. This is followed by an
acceleratory period, in which the evolution rate of the products in-
creases. Then for the third period, the gas evolution rate decreases
with time.

As shown in Fig. 14, the central region of the HMX particles shows
the granular structure formed during the heating of HMX. The outer
region, where HMX has been sublimed from the particle, reveals
the shell-like structure of the NVR formed during the decomposi-
tion. The main chemical reactions that occur in conjunction with
these physical processes lead to the emergence of new morpho-
logical structures. The main reaction pathways of HMX
decomposition could be summarized in the following ways: (a) the
formation of HCN from the elimination of HONO from HMX, and
the subsequent reaction products of HONO to form H2O, NO, and
NO2. This reaction is primarily associated with the decomposition
of HMX in the gas-phase, which has been proven by theoretical pre-
dictions that will be presented later in this section; (b) the formation
of the mononitroso analog of HMX by the replacement of an NO2
group with NO [212].

This pathway was elucidated from decomposition experiments
using mixtures of 15N-labeled HMX and 14N-labeled HMX in which
scrambling of the N—NO bond in the mononitroso product was ob-
served [213,214]; (c) the mononitroso analog of HMX formation by
the oxygen abstraction from the NO2 group in reaction of HMX and
NVR. Therefore, as the amount of presented NVR increased, the
amount of mononitroso HMX product without N—NO bond scram-
bling also increased; (d) the decomposition of mononitroso HMX

similar to the decomposition of the mononitroso analogue of RDX

mononitroso analog of HMX; (f) the decomposition of HMX on the
surface of the NVR yielding N2O and CH2O as the primary prod-
ucts; and (g) the decomposition of the NVR forms’ various amides
as decomposition products.

In comparison, the decomposition of HMX in the gas-state could
be described in two pathways: N—NO2 fission and HONO elimina-
tion (Fig. 15) [175,176]. In the first pathway, INT1 proceeds with a
ring closure between the oxygen atoms of the neighboring NO2
group in INT1, connecting with the nearby carbon atom obtained
from the breaking of the C—N bond in the proceeding step to form

a 10-member ring (INT2) by surmounting the transition state (TS2).
The O—N bond in INT2 then breaks, and the ring reopens to form
INT3 through the transition state TS3. With the assistance of a water
molecule, MN can easily decompose to H2CO and NNO [186]. For
each mole of HMX at this stage of the decomposition, an overall
reaction follows: HMX → NO2 + H2CN + 3H2CO + 3NNO. Once these
products are formed, the energy release sustains further decom-
position of HMX. Moreover, all barrier heights along this path are
lower than that of the initial step. Thus, the N—NO2 bond fission is
the rate-limiting step. The second pathway is similar to that pro-
posed by Melius [185] and Behrens [186]. The INT1 successively loses

three MN via INT7, TS9, and INT8, respectively. The final products
of this pathway are the same as in the first pathway. Both path-
ways in the N—NO2 fission path are quite promising due to the low
barrier heights of the subsequent steps. The distribution of prod-
ucts of these two pathways is in agreement with experimental
observations that 3 mol. of NNO are measured for each mole of de-
composed HMX [216].

As shown above, a number of experimental and theoretical studies
have been performed to elucidate the mechanistic details of the
thermal decomposition of RDX and HMX. Reported decomposition
products vary greatly on the experimental conditions such as heating
rate, sample dimensions and the composition of the surrounding
matrix. Unambiguous identification of the primary decomposition
products is difficult. A unified decomposition scheme for RDX and
HMX has been recently constructed using ab initio density func-
tional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 16). The unified description helps
us understand the formation mechanism of the key reactive radical
intermediates identified in the early stage of combustion or deto-
nation of these nitramines [211]. The determined primary
decomposition reactions were then combined with: (i) important
secondary reactions of the key reactive radical intermediates, such
as CH2NNO2 (methylene nitramine), CH2N, NO, NO2, OH, etc.; (ii) ex-
isting nitramine reaction networks shown in Figs. 11 and 15.

As shown in Fig. 16, the non-reactive products would not undergo
further reactions. The reactive products decompose and evolve gases
through the orifice. The relative rates of decomposition and evo-
lution of the reactive products are determined by the experimental
conditions, with the diameter of the reaction cell orifice having the

most significant effect. The minor products that evolve during the
decomposition process are shown in the box at the lower left. Al-
though the minor products represent only a small fraction of the
total products formed during the decomposition of RDX and HMX,
their identities and evolution rates provide insight into the differ-
ent cycles in the overall reaction mechanism. The solid-phase reaction
cycle is encountered first by the reactants, whose importance is de-
termined by the heating rate. If the heating rate is sufficiently rapid,
then the length of time spent in this cycle is short and the sample
will liquefy before an extensive reaction in the solid phase occurs.
However, if the heating rate is slow and the sample is maintained
at a temperature between 160 °C and its melting point, then reac-
tions are observed in the solid-phase. These reactions are complex
and nonlinear with respect to the reactants. In general, the decom-
position of HMX and RDX involves grain formation, nucleation and
growth of reactive sites, bubble formation, and nonlinear reactions
between the reactant and its nonvolatile secondary products.

Under the effect of nanoadditives, the decomposition mecha-
nism of RDX and HMX would be changed, resulting in different
proportions of main gaseous products [217]. It was shown that the
main gaseous products of RDX-based propellants are CH2O, NO2, CO2,
NO, CO and N2O, where N2O is a unique product from the decom-
position of RDX. With the addition of the nano-sized catalysts (metal
oxides and salts), the ratio of N2O/HCN, CH2O/NO2 and CH2O/NO were
greatly increased, indicating more N2O and CH2O have been pro-
duced. This means such catalysts usually favor the scission of C—N
bond. The CH2O is reported to be an effective catalyst that could react
with the dominant initial gaseous product of nitramines NO2 via:

right of Internal Report of Sandia National Laboratories.)

CH2O + NO2 → HCO + HONO (the first step), HCO + NO2 → CO + HONO
(the 2nd step), → H + CO2 + NO (the 3rd step) [218,219]. Under lower
temperature decomposition conditions, the first reaction step is dom-
inant, which is responsible for the catalytic decomposition of RDX
and HMX. The following two reaction steps are predominant at
higher temperatures in the flame zone, which are responsible for
the catalytic combustion of nitramine-based propellants with low-
pressure exponents. Meanwhile, the CH2O has a large negative heat
of formation (−115.9 kJ mol−1), resulting in a higher heat of decom-
position and combustion. It was reported that some nano additives
such as LaMnO3 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 could also accelerate the reac-
tions between CO and NO or oxidation of CO, which are two major
decomposition products of RDX as mentioned above.

However, the catalytic effect of the nanometal particles is very
different from those oxide or metal salt catalysts mentioned above,
because the nanometal fuel particles (Al, B and Mg) would undergo
oxidation reactions with the oxidizing products from the decom-
position of RDX and HMX. But for the transition metal particles such
as Ni and Cu, they would act as catalysts. It has been reported that
the transition metal particles, especially in nanometer sizes, have
very strong catalytic effects on the decomposition of nitramine ex-
plosives. The enhanced catalytic effect comes from the strong
adsorption of reactants on the active sites of the nanoadditives, which
form unstable complexes. Because the outer layer electron track of
transitional metals would exhibit the s–d hybrid orbitals, making
them slightly conductive with weak chemical activity. It would be
easier for them to participate in the redox reactions with an elec-
tron transfer, which would form the unstable complexes with the
oxidizers. Later on, the complexes can react with the reducing agents,
releasing the transition metals, which can be circulated many times.
In this way, the activation energy of the redox reaction is de-
creased, resulting in higher reaction rates. In particular, the nCu and
nNi could catalyze HMX decomposition twice. The first one is the
NO2 and H in HMX, which could be transferred by nCu or nNi,
because there is a large amount of defects in Cu or Ni crystals as
mentioned earlier in this paper. This would weaken the C—N and
N—N bond strengths, promoting the unimolecular decomposition
of HMX. The second decomposition is initiated by the nCu and nNi,
which could catalyze further thermolysis of NOx and accelerate the
decomposition of corresponding condensed-phase products. For in-
stance, HMX/Cu decomposes between 230 and 250 °C, during which

the gaseous products of HMX are mainly N2O. Cu would then react
with N2O forming CuO and N2, promoting the solid-state decom-
position of HMX. Heat release is increased accordingly.

As the most widely used catalysts, the catalytic mechanisms of
the metal oxides on the decomposition of RDX and HMX have been
intensively investigated. As shown above, the main evolved gases
during the HMX thermolysis are N2, NO, NO2, N2O, CH2O, HCN, CO,
CO2, and H2O. The addition of nano-sized metal oxides signifi-
cantly changes the dynamics of these evolved gases. Comparing the
temporal behavior of the main species for pure HMX, which has a
gas evolution between a narrow temperature range of 250–300 °C,
the onset temperature of HMX was lowered down to 150 °C under
the effects of nano oxides, as presented in Fig. 17 [88] (where the
nTiO2 is the most effective additive as stated earlier in Section 2.2.1).
To achieve the equal HMX fraction reacted in solid-state, an amount
of 3 wt.% of nTiO2 has to be added, whereas the amount of nFe2O3
should increase up to 20 wt.%. Detailed analysis of the catalytic HMX
decomposition with nTiO2 reveals that the evolving N2O was greatly
increased at 150 °C.

Based on the experimental results, a catalytic model of nTiO2 on
the decomposition of HMX was proposed (right side of Fig. 17). At
the beginning of the catalytic decomposition process (150 °C), the
OH groups evolving from the surface of nTiO2 act on the nitramine.
The nature of the evolved OH groups is not clear, but the observed
OH groups could be considered as water vapor. Some authors report
it as “free OH groups” [219]. It is still unclear whether they are OH
radicals, because their lifetime is no longer that 10−9 s. It was sug-
gested that the full or partial shifting of the electron pairs from the
metal cations to the surface of OH groups increases its activity and
ability to attract hydrogen atoms from the HMX molecule. After the
hydrogen adsorption, the N—NO2 bond energy in the HMX mole-
cule significantly drops, leading to the nitro-group detachment, as
it was theoretically predicted [220]. The NO2 group, in turn, can attack
an H atom in another HMX molecule, just like a “cage effect” (3a),
or adsorb on Lewis centers formed after partial dihydroxylation (3b).
The NO2 adsorption on the surface of nTiO2 at 250–350 °C was ob-
served experimentally [221], because the experimentally observed
NO2 concentration is lower for systems with nTiO2. The adsorp-
tion of NO2 would increase the heat release in the condensed phase
produced by reactions (4a–4c, see in Fig. 17) established by DSC
experiments.

Depending on the temperature and heating rate levels, two main
groups of gaseous products were observed. At low temperature and/
or heating rate, the main products are CH2O and N2O (4a), whereas
at high levels the products are dominated by HCN and NO2 (4b). The
observed higher ratio of [CH2O]/[N2O] during the catalytic decom-
position was caused by the OH interaction with the double bond
(4c) [221]. As mentioned above, the exothermic reaction (5) between
CH2O and NO2 occurred at higher temperatures, providing the
main exothermic effect. The main steps of the proposed model are
dehydroxylation on the surface of nanometal oxides, followed by
the initiation of the nitramine decomposition, and adsorption of lib-
erated NO2 on the surface of nTiO2 particles. Thus, nTiO2 plays a
twofold role in HMX decomposition: (i) being a source of active
species (OH-groups) initiating the HMX molecule destruction at a
low temperature (150 °C), and (ii) being an adsorption surface to
“keep” the NO2 close to the condensed phase, thus increasing the
amount of heat release there. Both indicated processes depend dif-
ferently on temperature and heating rate, thus defining the catalytic
efficiency of the nano-oxides in the HMX decomposition and com-
bustion processes.

The abovementioned catalytic mechanism of nTiO2 on the de-
composition of HMX could be applicable for other nanometal oxides
and perovskite-type metal salts to react with the nitramines [83–85].
However, the catalytic activity is changeable depending on the type
of nano additives. As shown in Section 2.2.1, the nano additive LaFeO3
is more effective than Fe2O3, and the main reason for that has to be
clarified. According to the theory of Behrens [212,213], during the
thermal decomposition of HMX in the presence of LaFeO3 and Fe2O3
with increasing temperature, the desorbed gases such as H2O (OH)
and O2 from the surface-adsorbed H2O would trap the hydrogen
atoms from HMX, resulting in the weakening of the electrostatics
in HMX crystal lattice. For LaFeO3, more surface-adsorbed species
can be lost. This is why it has a higher catalytic activity. In addi-
tion, it was reported that the reaction between CO and NO as the
major decomposition products of HMX can be catalyzed by LaFeO3
due to the oxide ion vacancy and surface-adsorbed oxygen of LaFeO3.
Therefore, LaFeO3 could accelerate the reaction because it has a
higher catalytic activity.

2.3.2. Catalytic decomposition of AP

The decomposition mechanism of AP has been intensively in-
vestigated since 1960s. It was widely accepted that there are two
mechanisms involved in the decomposition of AP: (a) electron trans-
fer mechanism [222,223] and (b) proton transfer mechanism

− + NH4

0 + NH4

+ → ClO4

[224,225] depending on the temperature level. For the first mech-
anism, the decomposition of AP occurs due to electron transfer from
0. The probability of
anion to cation via ClO4
electron realization is high due to the small distance between the
ions, resulting in an efficient acceptor of electrons located in inter-
stices. After accepting the electron ammonium radical decomposed
0 → NH3 + H, the H then mi-
into ammonia and hydrogen atom: NH4
grates through the crystal lattice of AP. The electron migrates exactly
in the same way over the anion’s sublattice, which results in the
interaction of ClO4 radical with H, forming HClO4. Continuous in-
teraction of HClO4 with H may result in H2O and ClO3. Afterwards,
the ClO3 radical would trap the electrons, and transform into the
ClO3 ion, followed by a decomposition of the chlorite ion and the
ClO4 radical. The products might interact with NH4 ions to gener-
ate secondary products, which are mainly chlorine, nitrogen hemi
oxide, and water. By considering the theory of electron transition
within the energy-band, the electron may transit from the valence
to conduction band, which makes AP as a typical dielectric mate-
rial. Therefore, at LTD of AP, the process cannot be sustained by
electron transfer because of its low probability of electron trans-
fer mechanism. The primary products detected in LTD experiments
by different researchers are predominantly NH3 and HClO4. This is
allowed assuming that the primary stage of the process of thermal
decomposition of AP is a proton transfer.

+ + ClO4

+ to the anion ClO4

If the value of Ea for thermal decomposition and sublimation is
similar and their products were identical [226,227], while the re-
action and acceleration in the vapor of NH3 and HClO4 were inhibited,
then the decomposition of AP would favor a proton transfer mech-
− = NH3(a) + HClO4(a) = NH3(g) + HClO4(g), where
anism, i.e.; NH4
subscript “a” means adsorbed and “g” means gas-phase. During step
I, a pair of ions was captured in AP lattice, while step II involves the
decomposition step that starts with a proton transfer from the cation
− via molecular complex. Then it decomposes
NH4
into NH3 and HClO4. The molecules of NH3 and HClO4 can either react
in the adsorbed layer on the AP surface or in the gas phase. Many
reactions occur rapidly in the gas phase between NH3 and HClO4,
forming by-products such as O2, N2O, Cl2, NO, and H2O at low tem-
peratures (<350 °C). An essential feature of the thermal decomposition
of AP is that the process does not occur exactly at the surface, but
in the pores that are several microns beneath the crystal surface.
This is the key feature that differentiates its thermal decomposi-
tion and sublimation. In the adsorbed layer, it was assumed that
HClO4 was desorbed more rapidly than NH3, which causes incom-
plete oxidation of NH3, creating a saturated atmosphere of NH3. As

a result, HTD decelerates and undergoes incomplete transforma-
tion. During the second exothermic decomposition, the NO, O2, Cl2,
and H2O products were formed as a result of the gas-phase reactions.
The first process of thermal decomposition both at low and high
+
temperatures begins with the proton transfer from the cation NH4
−. The difference between the decomposition of low-
to the anion ClO4
temperature orthorhombic modification and the high-temperature
cubic one arises when the secondary processes occur. These pro-
cesses during the decomposition of orthorhombic and cubic
modifications differ both in the character of chemical processes and
in the topography of their course [228]. The decomposition of the
low-temperature orthorhombic modification proceeds in the pores
beneath the surface in the sites, where the secondary dissociation
products are accumulated. The conditions for regeneration of active
centers also exist in these sites, either due to pressure of the gases
formed in a pore or due to decomposition of HClO4 and interaction
of the products of its decomposition with NH3. The condition for
secondary processes could provide the feedback between the re-
action products’ accumulation and the formation of new active
centers, which are the main reasons for orthorhombic modifica-
tion decomposition. Because of this, the utilization of additives
associated with a change in irradiation and other factors that affect
the reactivity of the initial crystal is mainly responsible for its ini-
tiation process. When a higher temperature is employed, AP
decomposes in its cubic modification. In this case, the processes taking
place on its crystal surface play a major role: adsorption and des-
orption of NH3 and HClO4 as mentioned above, which is connected
more with the proton transfer. Then the decomposition of HClO4
determines the catalytic activity of the orthorhombic modification,
which is much higher than that of the cubic modification. So, in spite
of advances in investigating the mechanism of thermal decompo-
sition of AP, the mechanism is still under discovery, especially when
examining nanoadditives that have been used as catalyzers.

For AP-based compositions, the most widely used nanoadditives
are transition metals and their oxides. The earliest literature on cata-
lytic thermal decomposition mechanism of nano Cu/CNTs composite
and combustion mechanism of AP/HTPB propellant was pub-
lished in 1980s [229]. It was reported that copper nanopowder
contains many defects over the crystal lattice. The copper atoms on
the defects are not saturated and tend to become steady by ab-
sorbing materials with surplus electrons onto its surface. The N atom
of AP contains surplus electrons, so the N—X bond becomes weak
and easy to break owing to the absorption of the N atom on the
surface of the Cu atom. This is advantageous in the production of
NH3. Because nitrogen oxides are produced both in the first and
second decomposition steps of AP, the nCu can accelerate the de-
composition of AP by catalyzing the decomposition of nitrogen
oxides. It has been reported that nitrogen oxides react easily with
Cu via 4Cu + 2NO → 2Cu2O + N2 and 2Cu2O + 2NO → 4CuO + N2
[106,109]. On the other hand, the nCu contains large defects, while
the unpaired electrons in the 4s orbital of Cu atoms are in the un-
saturated state. The free radicals can absorb NH3 with an excess of
electrons. In view of both these effects, the nCu powder shows a
high catalytic effect on the first and second decomposition steps of
AP. As mentioned above, similar to nCu, the nNi also has a large
number of defects and pores in its crystals, which changes the pe-
riodic nature of the lattice structure as well as the band structure.
This would increase the number of electron carriers, and promote
the electron transfer process. Under low temperature decomposi-
tions of AP/nNi, the low valence band on the surface of nNi would
−, resulting in an accelerated decom-
accept the electron from ClO4
position reaction by the annihilation of vacancies. This process could
be expressed as: [e]+ + ClO4
− + e, where
− → Ooxide + ClO3
[e]+ is the vacancy in the valence band and the Ooxide is the oxygen
atom obtained from the oxides. The catalytic effect could be real-
ized by the elimination of inhibition through oxidation of the

nanometals by the oxygen-rich intermediates from thermolysis of
AP, such as HClO4, ClO4, ClO3 and ClO. The typical reaction pro-
cesses include: Ni + ClO → NiO + Cl and Ni + O → NiO. The inhibition
is originated from the absorption of NH3 at the state of LTD of AP,
covering the active center. The presence of nNi decreases the in-
hibition of the second state decomposition. In this way, the localized
hotspots are formed, and then the potential reactive sites can be
activated and propagated, resulting in a much lower peak temper-
ature for the HTD process of AP. It is also the case for many other
nano-sized transition metals.

However, for the fuel metals such nAl, the catalytic mechanism
would be much different. The effect of nAl on decomposition gas
evolution of AP has been investigated [230]. It has been shown that,
in the case of neat AP, the first peak gas release is in the range of
280–350 °C, where the release of N2O was greater than NO2 (Table 9).
The second peak is from 350–380 °C, where the ratio of NO2 to N2O
continues to increase and the intensity of NO2 was higher than that
of N2O (Fig. 18).

The third peak is from 380 to 450 °C, where the ratio of NO2 to
N2O is almost constant, indicating that the thermal decomposition
process is at a stable stage. Similar results were obtained for the
AP/nAl (60/40) mixture in the low temperature decomposition, but
the ratio of NO2 to N2O slowly decreases with the increase of tem-
perature during HTD of AP/nAl. Meanwhile, the onset and end
temperatures for each step were different between AP and AP/nAl.
Those for the AP/nAl are from 300 to 333 °C (step 1), 333 to 365 °C
(step 2), and 365 to 410 °C (step 3). Compared to AP, the onset tem-
perature of the first step was increased and the third step decreased,
suggesting that the addition of 40 nm Al hinders the LTD of AP and
catalyzes HTD.

In the case of carbon nanomaterials, as shown in Tables 3 and
4, the decomposition of AP can be greatly affected by CNMs. For in-
stance, graphene has a catalytic effect on the decomposition of AP,
while the thermolysis of oxidizing products from AP may react with
GA, promoting the heat release [231]. Meanwhile, there is only one
peak for AP/GA nanocomposites in comparison with two peaks from
pure AP, which is 83.7 °C lower than the second peak of AP, with a
total heat release of 2110 J g−1 (Table 4). It has been shown that the
as-prepared AP/GA nanostructured energetic composites have nu-
merous nanoscale pores and the SSA is about 49.2 m2 g−1, resulting
in accelerated decomposition and a greater total heat release [232].
Graphene may also change the decomposition mechanism of AP,
which has been shown in Fig. 19. In contrast, the Cu/CNT catalyst
would remarkably decrease the second peak of AP, with a higher
decomposition heat [145] and the catalytic mechanism is similar
to nCu as stated above, but the inclusion of CNTs could increase the
heat and electron conductivity.

Moreover, the graphene could be combined with metal oxides
to improve the catalytic activity. For instance, GA/Fe2O3 nanostructured
catalyst dispersed in AP showed significant catalytic effects on ther-
molysis of AP, where only one decomposition step was observed.
The peak temperature is obviously decreased, while the total heat
release is greatly increased [111].

2.4. Kinetic compensation effects for the catalytic decomposition

During the investigation of decomposition kinetics for solid-
state materials, in addition to the kinetic parameters and physical
models, one has to take into account another very important phe-
nomena; the so-called “Kinetic Compensation Effect” (KCE). It states
that there is a linear relationship between Arrhenius parameters
ln(A) and Ea for a family of related processes [233,234]. It is a widely
observed phenomenon in many areas of science, notably hetero-
geneous catalysis [235]. However, it was demonstrated, both
theoretically and numerically, that random errors in kinetic data
would generate an apparent compensation effect (sometimes
termed as statistical compensation effect) when the true Arrhenius

ic composite. (Reprinted from Ref. [145] with permission of copyright © 2014, Springer

parameters are constant [234]. Therefore, one has to use the same
technique, experimental conditions, and identical calculation
methods to evaluate the kinetic parameters for different materials
in order to confirm the existence and reliability of a KCE that is not
due to random errors. Expressions for the gradient of data points
on a plot of ln(A) against Ea are derived when experimental kinetic
data are analyzed by linear regression.

It reveals from Eq. (2.4) that when T = 1/ξR, the decomposition
reaction of the materials in the same family will have the same rate
constant, indicating that Tiso equals to 1/ξR. With a set of varied
kinetic parameters, the plots of kinetic compensation effect could
be established for different groups of reaction processes.

Interestingly, it has been reported that the kinetic points of all
nitric esters obtained by model-fitting fall almost on the same com-
pensation line, indicating that they follow the same compensation
effects due to the same dependence of enthalpy change (ΔH) and
the entropy change (ΔS) caused by dissociation of the O—NO2 bond
[236,237]. It is known from the transition state theory that Ea cor-
responds to enthalpy change while Ln(A) is related to entropy change.
A wide variety of other physical reasons for the kinetic compensation
effect have been proposed in the literature for particular situations
[238]. It was further discovered that the nitramines and their PBXs
also follow the same compensation line regardless of the effect of

polymer matrices (Fig. 20d); where the rate-limiting steps for their
decomposition are featured by the bond rupture of N—NO2 (elim-
ination of either NO2 or HONO). It can also be noticed that slope (ξ)
for nitric esters is larger than that of nitramine-based materials. It
means that the isokinetic temperature (1/ξR) of the latter is higher,
which agrees with the fact that thermal stability of nitramines in
most cases is better than nitric esters. Similarly, the kinetic com-
pensation effect has also been found for thermal decomposition of
aromatic nitrocompounds, if we use the data from the literature [237],
which have the lowest ξ value indicating the highest isokinetic tem-
perature. Thermal decomposition of such compounds is featured
with the scission of C—NO2 bond, which was supposed to have higher
dissociation energy than N—NO2 and O—NO2 bonds, resulting in
improved thermal stability. The dependences of Ea on α for nitramine-
based materials and nitric esters show that nitric esters and nitramine-
based materials follow two compensation lines. It confirms that the
nitric esters and nitramines have different rate-limiting decompo-
sition mechanisms. However, for the tetrazole-based materials, the
situation is again different due to the multi-step decomposition. The

first step of Tetrazene is out of the compensation line due to un-
derestimation of activation energy caused by simultaneous
evaporation [159]. The rate-limiting decomposition step of this group
of materials was said to connect with collaborative fission of CRing—N
and N—N bonds. Its isokinetic temperature should be lower than
that of abovementioned three groups of materials according to the
slopes of their compensation lines. It is the case that as primary ex-
plosives MTX-1 and Tetrazene are less stable than secondary
explosives. The situation for azido s-triazine derivatives is more com-
plicated due to involvement of multi-steps with different mechanisms
[132]. The first two steps of TAHT and TANDAzT seem to follow the
same line with the lowest isokinetic temperature, compared to the
other group of energetic materials, which according to the quantum
chemical calculation is due to successive scission of azido groups.
Under the effect of nanoadditives, in the case of RDX, it seems
that the slope of the compensation line slightly decreases with the
inclusion of nanometal oxides and nanodiamonds (Fig. 20a). As stated
above, these nanomaterials could absorb the liquid RDX and hinder
the evaporation process, thereby making the decomposition process

106

dominant by the mass loss of the gaseous products and resulting in
a higher isokinetic temperature Tiso. It can be further seen that the
nanoadditives PCC, nNPF, FHN, and nAl would further decrease the
slope of the compensation line, due to the strong catalytic effect on
the decomposition of these materials with RDX. The nNPF, FHN, and
nAl are all energetic materials with exothermic processes during
decomposition. However, it was reported that double-base com-
ponent NC/NG and RDX-based gun propellants all follow the same
compensation line of RDX and HMX [239,240], the same applies to
the line for nitramine-based materials as shown in Fig. 20d. For cata-
lytic decomposition of HMX, the situation is quite different. HMX
decomposes in the solid-state with sublimation, and nanoadditives
have little effect on its compensation line, which is in agreement
with the literature [88]. It means these nanomaterials did not change
the rate limiting decomposition of HMX. For ionic salt AP, it is similar
to HMX, the nanoadditives would not affect the slope of the com-
pensation line, but several nanomaterials such as nNi and nAl can
increase its frequency factor of decomposition, due to the strong
catalytic effect and energetic nature of these nanometals. It is in-
teresting that the ignition kinetic parameters of AP-based
compositions also follow the compensation line for pure AP, which
means that the nanoadditives could decrease the ignition delay and
critical temperature, but they did not change the initial decompo-
sition rate-limiting step of AP that leads to runaway chemical
reactions/ignitions.

3. Catalytic combustion of RDX-, HMX-, and
AP-based propellants

The burning surface of a rocket propellant grain recedes in a di-
rection perpendicular to itself (Piobert, 1836). The rate of regression,
typically measured in inches per second (or mm s−1), is termed the
burning rate (or burn rate, u). Knowing quantitatively the burning
rate of a propellant, and how it depends on various conditions, is
fundamentally important for a successful design of a solid rocket
motor [241]. There are various factors that influence the burning
rate, and the most significant ones being [242]: (1) combustion
chamber pressure “p”; (2) initial temperature of the propellant grain;
(3) velocity of the combustion gases flowing parallel to the burning
surface; (4) local static pressure; (5) motor acceleration and spin.
The burning rate can be particularly sensitive to the value of the
pressure exponent, n, which is the slope of the log (u) vs. log (p)
curve. High values of n can produce large changes in the burning
rate with relatively small changes in chamber pressure but with po-
tentially catastrophic consequences [243]. Moreover, a high-
pressure exponent can result in a difficult start for the rocket motor.
It is sometimes desirable to modify the burning rate such that it is
more suitable to a certain propellant grain configuration. There are
a number of ways of modifying the burning rate: (1) decrease the
oxidizer particle size; (2) increase the percentage of oxidizer (greater
O/F ratio); (3) operate the motor at a lower or higher chamber pres-
sure; (4) add a burning rate catalyst or suppressant, which is certainly
the best and most effective means to modify the burning rate. As
stated in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the nanoadditives in most cases are
more effective catalysts, which could enhance the decomposition
of fuels and oxidizers. Meanwhile, they could accelerate the vapor-
ized fuel reactions in the gas-phase combustion zone, and increase
the heat transfer rate at the propellant surface layer [244]. The cata-
lytic effects of different types of nanoadditives on homogeneous and
composite propellants are discussed in the following sections.

3.1. Combustion of homogeneous propellants

3.1.1. Effects of nanometal oxides

reported as combustion catalysts [39]. Nanocrystals of nickel oxide
(nNiO) and ZnO were prepared by a novel refluxing method and their
average particles sizes were found to be 6 and 31 nm, respectively
[244]. These nanotransition metal oxides were found to be prom-
ising combustion catalysts of double-base propellants (DB) and RDX-
based modified DB (MDB) [245]. In past decades, published work
on catalytic combustion of nano-sized additives has been carried
out mostly by Zhao’s group [87,241,245–253]. They investigated the
effects of many kinds of nanometal oxides on the combustion prop-
erties of double-base (DB) propellants and modified DB propellants.
These metal oxides include nanobismuth oxide (nBi2O3), nPbO,
nanoceria (nCeO2), nNiO, nanocobalt oxide (nCo2O3), and nanocuprous
oxide (nCu2O). These nanomaterials were prepared mainly by the
solid-state reaction, and fully characterized by TEM, XRD, and SEM
techniques. Meanwhile, in order to facilitate comparisons, the or-
dinary PbO catalyst was also included. The propellants are prepared
by the following procedures, unless otherwise specified below in
the data tables: each propellant sample has a total weight of 500 g.
The DB propellants contain 2.5% nanoadditives, while RDX-based
MDB propellants contain 3% nanoadditives. The burning strands were
obtained via a process of conventional solvent-free preparation of
extrusion: the raw materials were mixed in water and then under-
went drying, rolling, and machining. The strands were coated with
polyvinyl alcohol and have a final dimension of 5 mm × 150 mm.
The combustion pressure range was between 2 and 22 MPa, and the
pressure exponent (n) was calculated according to u = apn. The ob-
tained burning rates of homogeneous DB and MDB propellants under
the effects of nanometal oxides are summarized in Table 10.

As can be seen from Table 10, both ordinary PbO and nPbO can
increase the burning rate of DB and MDB propellants, but the pres-
sure exponents (n) are still high: propellants containing ordinary
PbO have n of 0.277 for 6 < p < 10 MPa, while it is 0.268 for nPbO
for 6 < p < 12 MPa. In contrast, the nBi2O3 can also slightly de-
crease the n to 0.559 under a higher-pressure range of 10–14 MPa,
but it does not increase the burning rate. It can be seen that nBi2O3,
nCeO2, and nCu2O have a certain catalytic effect on DB propellant,
but no plateau combustion effect was obtained with relatively high-
pressure exponents. The nNiO and nCo2O3 could decrease the burning
rate of DB propellants within the attempted pressures, suggesting
that they are negative catalysts. It was reported that the nBi2O3 has
a better catalytic effect than nPbO on increasing the burning rate
of DB in a low-pressure range, where nBi2O3 makes propellant pres-
sure exponents drop from 0.80 to 0.71 (a decline of 11.3%). The nBi2O3
could assure a higher burning rate with a low-pressure exponent,
and it is even better than PbO on this issue. But for MDB propel-
lants, 2% of Bi2O3 or nPbO could not achieve the plateau combustion
effect, which could be obtained with a combination of carbon black
(CB) or copper salts with much lower pressure exponents [245]. It
was further confirmed that the catalytic capacity of nPbO is better
than the ordinary PbO. The pressure exponent of DB propellants con-
taining 3% of nPbO is about 0.3 in the pressure range of 4–10 MPa.
When nPbO is mixed with copper salts, the “mesa” burning effect
can be observed [246].

In order to examine nanometal oxide composites (binary) and
their “synergetic,” catalytic effect, several binary metal oxides
were used in DB and MDB propellants [247,248]. These binary
nanocomposites include nPbO · CuO (nPCC), nCuO · SnO2, nMgO · SnO2,
and nCuO · Cr2O3. The DB propellants contain 2.5% of the
nanocomposites, while it was 3% for the MDB propellants. The pro-
pellant strands were prepared by a conventional solvent-free
extruding technique. The burning rate results for the DB and MDB
propellants under the effects of nano binary metal oxide compos-
ites are shown in Table 11 and they are plotted and compared with
metal oxides in Fig. 21.

There are many kinds of metal oxides that have been used as
burning rate catalysts, but only a few nano-sized metal oxides are

As can be seen from Table 11 and Fig. 21, only the nanocomposite
nPCC could make MDB propellant exhibit higher burning rates for

2 ≤ p ≤ 4 MPa, which is followed by a low-pressure exponent com-
bustion zone at 4–8 MPa. The catalytic efficiency factors (η) of the
nPCC catalyst are 2.69, 1.83, 1.17, and 1.02 at the pressure of 2, 4, 6
and 8 MPa, respectively. The efficiency factor η = uc/u0, where u0 is
the burning rate and the blank reference propellant and uc is of the
burning rate of the propellants with catalysts. The “mesa” burning
occurred at 4–6 MPa with a pressure exponent n of −0.192. Above
the pressure of 8 MPa, the burning rates of MDB propellants with
nPCC catalyst were lower than the blank sample. It indicates that
the nPCC catalyst has better activity in the lower pressure ranges,
resulting in significantly reduced pressure exponents. As stated
above, the nPCC has great catalytic effects, but the aggregation during
preparation of corresponding propellants caused some issues with
homogeneity. In order to solve this problem, and improve its cata-
lytic activity, isocyanate was used to further modify the surface
structure of nPCC, and a modified nanocomposite was obtained,
named as nTPCC, herein.

As shown in Fig. 21b, the nTPCC has even much better catalytic
effects with wider pressure ranges of plateau combustion, whether
it was dispersed before adding it to the compositions. The “mesa
burning” effect could be observed between 6 and 10 MPa with a

pressure exponent of −0.867. This means that the surface modifi-
cation of nPCC by surfactant would further improve its catalytic
efficiency. This result demonstrates that the nTPCC is capable of re-
ducing the pressure exponent for both DB and MDB propellants in
a broader pressure range and it can be widely used in other MDB
propellants containing nitramines.

Since nPCC and n-TPCC are very effective in decreasing the pres-
sure exponents of MDB propellants, the effects of their contents on
the burning rate of the propellants have been further investi-
gated, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 12. It can
be seen that the 3% of nTPCC could decrease the n to −0.075 and
−0.867 in pressure ranges of 6–8 and 8–10 MPa, respectively. The
n-TPCC has higher catalytic efficiency under lower pressure ranges,
and it has η of 2.59, 1.32 at 2 and 6 MPa, respectively. This means
the burning rate of MDB was increased 2.59 times at 2 MPa. Ap-
parently, after well dispersion of nTPCC in MDB, more significant
increase in burning rate occurred and the following mesa burning
zone has an even lower n value of −1.245. When the content of nTPCC
was reduced from 3% to 1.5%, the catalytic efficiency in the low-
pressure range (2–8 MPa) was slightly decreased. The plateau
combustion zone (6–8 MPa) also had a higher n of 0.031 and it was

−0.832 for the mesa burning zone (8–10 MPa). When the nTPCC was
used together with CB in the MDB propellant, much higher burning
rates were obtained, and the plateau combustion zone was en-
larged to the pressure of 12–22 MPa with n less than 0.3.

In contrast, nCuO · Cr2O3 composites have a certain catalytic effect,
but this did not create a plateau combustion zone for the DB pro-
pellant with relatively large pressure exponents. Similarly, the
nMgO · SnO2 has little catalytic effect on DB propellants, while it
is not so significant for nCuO · SnO2 composite. However, the
nanocomposite PbO · SnO2, with an average grain size of 40–
60 nm, can obviously increase the burning rate of DB propellant
between 2 and 20 MPa while decreasing the pressure exponent to
0.257 in pressure ranges of 10–20 MPa. In the case of MDB propel-
lant, the nPbO · SnO2 has to be combined with CB in order to obtain
similar catalytic effects, as it does for DB propellants [248]. As a com-
parison, very similar to nTPC and nTPCC, the nanocomposite Bi2WO6
can also greatly increase the burning rate of the DB propellant, and
decrease the pressure exponent (Fig. 22). Especially, the plateau com-
bustion could be obtained at the high-pressure range of 16–
22 MPa [87]. The bismuth citrate has a comparable catalytic efficiency
as nBi2WO6 in the pressure range of 3–9 MPa, but it is not so ef-
fective in decreasing the pressure exponents. In conclusion, the nTPCC

and nBi2WO6 are of great potential to be used as catalysts in DB and
MDB propellants.

3.1.2. Effects of nanometal organic salts

Similar to nano metal oxides, systematic comparative studies were
conducted on catalytic effects of nano organic salts (complex) to DB
and RDX-based MDB propellants [247,249–255]. The nano organic
salts utilized include nano lead 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (nPbDHB),
nano copper p-aminobenzoate (nCuAB), nano lead phthalate (nPbP),
nano lead 3-nitrophthalate (nPbNP), nano lead 3,5-dinitrosalicylate
(nPbDNS), nano lead 1,4-dinitrobenzoate (nPbDNB), normal
bismuth(III) gallate (BiGal), nano lead gallate complex (nPbGal), and
nano-Pb(II)-tannin acid complex (nPbTA). The compositions of the
reference blank DB and MDB propellants are the same as in above
section. The burning rates of DB propellants under influence of the
abovementioned organic salts and corresponding catalytic efficien-
cy are plotted and compared in Fig. 23, while the burning rate are
listed in Table 13. Comparing the blank DB propellant in Fig. 23a and
b, it can be seen that both nPbDHB and PbDHB could make the DB
propellant undergo enhanced burning rate within 2–6 MPa, but the
propellant containing nPbDHB with an average particle size of about
40 nm (Fig. 23) burns faster than that of normal PbDHB. The burning

rate at 2 MPa was improved by 11.34% and the catalytic efficiency
was increased 0.23 by using nPbDHB (Fig. 23). The burning rate at
6 MPa was increased by 1.67%, while the η was improved by 3%.
Meanwhile, PbDHB in both nano and micro scale (morphology see
Fig. 24) could induce a “mesa” combustion zone for DB propel-
lants in the pressure range of 6–10 MPa with n of −0.24 and −0.25,
respectively. When the pressure is over 10 MPa, their burning rate–
pressure curves almost coincide with each other. This indicates that
unlike ordinary PbDHB, the nPbDHB can improve the burning rate

at a modest or lower pressure range (2–10 MPa), and it may extend
the mesa combustion zone to the pressure range of 6–10 MPa, which
would be beneficial to rocket motor design.

In comparison, the burning rate of DB containing nPbAB is lower
than that of ordinary PbAB under pressure ranges of 2–18 MPa.
However, the plateau combustion phenomenon occurs in ranges of
6–8 MPa for that of nPbAB, while the burning rate of the latter grows
constantly within this pressure range. However, both of them
could induce the “mesa” burning effects under pressure ranges of

The reference DB propellants contain 89% of NG/NC with a nitrogen content of 12.0%, 8.5% of diethyl phthalate (DEP), and 2.5% of ballistic modifiers; the contents of the
catalysts are 3% by weight for DB propellant; MDB-1 propellant contains 66% of NC/NG, 30% of RDX, 0.4% of β-Cu, and 0.5% of CB and 2.5% of the nanocatalysts.

8–10 MPa, while their burning rate remained relatively constant at
a higher pressure range (10–20 MPa). The dependence of catalytic
efficiency on the pressure for these two nanoadditives also has the
same trend (Fig. 23c and d). The above results show that the nPbAB
is not as good as normal PbAB in improving the burning rate, but
nPbAB is better than normal PbAB in reducing the pressure expo-
nents. Moreover, the nPbP and ordinary PbP can increase the burning
rate of the DB propellant, where nPbP has a stronger effect on that.
In the lower pressure range (2–6 MPa), due to the induction of speed-
ing combustion (sometimes called super rate combustion), the DB
propellants containing nPbP or ordinary PbP have higher-pressure
exponents (0.85 and 0.83, respectively) than that of the blank DB
propellant (0.45). The one containing nPbP would undergo a stron-
ger mesa combustion process with a larger negative pressure
exponent (−0.74) in the pressure range of 6–10 MPa, and it disap-
peared when the pressure exceeded 10 MPa. This indicates that the
nPbP has a better catalytic performance (higher η) than its micron-
sized counterpart. With the introduction of energetic groups in the

abovementioned nanocatalysts, the burning rate of DB propel-
lants could be further improved by using them. Considering this
theory, two novel energetic nano organic salts nPbNP have been pre-
pared [249]. They were used together with CB to modify the burning
properties of MDB propellants.

It was shown that the nPbNP/CB is the best in terms of increas-
ing the burning rate, decreasing the pressure exponent, and
broadening the pressure range of plateau combustion. This is sup-
posed to occur because the nPbNP/CB has a great capacity to increase
the thickness of the surface reaction zone and the dark zone, as well
as elevate the temperature in these zones. According to the flame-
out surface analysis, the condensed-phase products contain metallic
lead and copper on the carbon skeleton; thereby generating the re-
ductive reaction of their oxides [249]. This is the case for all catalyst-
based copper (lead) oxides or slats during the combustion of
metalized propellants, where the metal fuels (Al, Mg, or their alloy)
may be oxidized by copper (lead) oxides following a mechanism of
thermites [256,257]. As can be seen from Fig. 22, for pressure within

the range of 4–22 MPa, the nPbNP has a better catalytic perfor-
mance than ordinary PbNP, resulting in a higher burning rate.
However, the burning rate of DB propellants containing nPbNP is
lower than that of the ordinary PbNP within the range of 2–4 MPa.
At lower pressure ranges (2–8 MPa), the blank DB propellant even
has smaller pressure exponents (0.45) than those of catalyzed ones
(n = 0.74, 0.59 for nPbNP, and PbNP, respectively), indicating that
the speeding combustion behavior was induced by the nanocatalysts
in this pressure range [174,253]. Meanwhile, it was observed that,
compared to normal PbNP, the nPbNP has a weaker catalytic effi-
ciency on the combustion of DB propellants in the pressure range
of 2–4 MPa. This indicated that the n-PbNP has a much better cata-
lytic effect on combustion of DB propellants only at higher-pressure
ranges. Similar trends could be observed for n-PbDNS and PbDNS,
but they have relatively low catalytic effect on DB propellants, re-
sulting in lower burning rate and smaller η.

In comparison, the nPbTA was prepared by means of liquid dis-
persion deposition method [250]. The catalytic action of this complex
on MDB propellant was evaluated as well. It was observed that the
average particle size of nPbTA is about 80 nm and that it could ob-
viously improve the burning rate of MDB propellant by 148% [250],
while the pressure exponent also decreased from 0.86 to 0.13 in the
pressure range of 6–8 MPa. In addition to nPbGal [255], some other
micron-sized composite gelate salts such as Gal-BiCu were pre-
pared and evaluated in MDB propellants. The results showed that
the burning rate of the propellant increased from 13.92 to
25.77 mm·s−1 at 10 MPa and the corresponding n was around 0.2.
When it was used together with CB, the plateau combustion region
was extended to 8–22 MPa [251]. The catalytic effect of the copper
and lead could be further enhanced by a chelation process using a
mesoporous carbon as a carrier [254]. The chelated copper–lead–
carbon composite could then be used as an active burning rate
catalyst. It was shown that this nanocomposite exists in a cone-
shaped aggregate (Fig. 23) with an SSA of 28 m2 g−1 and a pore

volume of 0.629 cm3 g−1. The burning rate of aluminized MDB pro-
pellant containing this nanocomposite is 27.59 mm s−1 at 20 MPa,
which is even higher than that of MDB propellant containing the
nTPCC/CB. As shown in Fig. 25, the burning of Al particle was greatly
enhanced with an increased heat release due to the presence of a
porous Pb—Cu—C chelate catalyst. The corresponding pressure ex-
ponent was then decreased from 0.96 to 0.48 over the pressure range
of 4–20 MPa [254].

3.1.3. Effects of nanothermites

As a unique group of EMs, the nanothermites are widely inves-
tigated and used in many applications, even though their reactions
are mechanistically not well understood [257]. The nanothermites
would undergo ultra-fast transient reaction, and therefore they are
considered as good candidate nanoadditives for enhancing the com-
bustion of propellants. It was recently found that the energy release
for nanothermites occurred in the condensed phase. The combus-
tion of nanothermites is a complex multiphase process that is still
not well understood. Therefore, the heat transfer mechanisms were
further examined, showing that the movement of condensed-
phase material plays a critical role in the heat transfer process [258].
Currently, most of the nanothermite compositions are based on
nAl with some other metal oxides or fluoropolymers. The flame
tube is usually used to evaluate the combustion properties of
nanothermites, which is the key factor that affects the combus-
tion behavior of solid propellants containing them as additives.
The flame tube measurements showed that most of nAl-based
nanothermites are useful for enhancing the combustion perfor-
mance of solid propellants due to their high burning rate and peak
pressures (Table 14). It is clear that the reaction propagation of
nanothermites falls into mainly three categories determined by the
behavior of the oxidizer upon nAl ignition. Studies showed that the
metal oxides that decompose or gasify at temperatures below

the adiabatic flame temperature for the reaction would result in
higher flame propagation rates [266].

As shown in Table 14, this is the case for oxidizers such as CuO,
MoO3, WO3, and Bi2O3. Metal oxidizers that decompose or gasify
above the adiabatic flame temperature likely initiate in the con-
densed phase reaction, which promotes slower propagation speeds.
This is the case for Fe2O3 and NiO. Moreover, certain reducing agents
could also be selected from the halogen family, such as fluorine and
iodine, which typically decompose at temperatures well below the
melting temperature of Al. They could act as aggressive oxidizers
partly due to their relatively high electronegativity. Recent re-
search also reveals that when Al reacts with a halogenated oxidizer
(i.e., either a fluoropolymer-like polytetrafluoroethylene or certain
iodine oxides that decompose below the ignition temperature of
Al) the halogen reacts exothermically with the alumina passiva-
tion shell surrounding Al particles [267–269]. Many thermal
equilibrium studies point to specific interactions between fluo-
rine and alumina as well as iodine and alumina that lead to pre-
ignition reactions. In this way, the alumina shell serves to provide
a site of exothermic activity in contrast to simply acting as a dif-
fusion barrier inert to the combustion process as with the metal
oxides. On the one hand, the feature of the nanothermites indi-
cates that as the main ingredient of the metalized solid propellants,
Al particles could be combined with metal oxides, fluoropolymers
or iodine oxides to enhance its ignitability in the condensed phase
on the burning surface and therefore improve the combustion
efficiency. Here the combustion efficiency could be simply defined
as the transformation extent of the solid residue to the gaseous

products. On the other hand, as energetic catalysts, the nanothermites
could improve the burning rate and combustion efficiency of DB or
MDB propellants. Several research works have been conducted re-
garding the catalytic effect of nanothermites on DB propellants
[270,271]. For the work carried out in Zhao’s group, the reference
propellants are the same as mentioned in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2,
where the contents of the catalysts are 2.5% for DB propellant and
3% for RDX-based MDB propellant. The burning rates of DB propel-
lants under the influence of nanothermites are shown in Table 15.
The burning rate and corresponding catalytic efficiency are plotted
in Figs. 26 and 27 for a better comparison.

The nanothermites Al/PbO, Al/CuO and Al/Bi2O3 were prepared
by ultrasonic dispersion method [272,274]. In general, it was shown
that nanothermites have a positive catalytic effect on enhancing the
burning rate, but the pressure exponents did not improve notice-
ably. The order of catalytic efficiency is Al/PbO > Al/Bi2O3 > Al/CuO
[274]. Compared with nPbO shown in Fig. 26, the nanothermite
Al/PbO would further improve the burning rate, especially in the
pressure range of 2–20 MPa, but the pressure exponent has dete-
riorated due to strong pressure dependent combustion of nAl metal
particles. As shown in Fig. 21, in pressure range of 10–16 MPa, the
burning rate of DB propellants containing nPbO is lower than that
of the blank sample, showing a negative catalytic effect. In con-
trast, 2.5% of nAl/PbO would greatly increase the burning rate of DB
propellants in a wider pressure range (2–20 MPa), while accept-
able pressure exponents could be realized within 8–14 MPa operating
pressures. The nAl/PbO has a catalytic efficiency η of 2.54, 2.12, 1.77,
and 1.59 at pressure of 2, 4, 6 and 8 MPa, respectively. In particular,

the burning rate was increased by 154% at 2.0 MPa, and speeding
combustion was shown at the pressure of 2–22 MPa with η greater
than 1.30. In comparison, the micron-sized Al/PbO (mAl/PbO) ther-
mite could also increase the burning rate of DB propellants at lower-
and higher-pressure ranges, but not as effectively as the nAl/PbO
counterpart could. The catalytic efficiency of mAl/PbO is above 1.20
in the pressure range of 4–22 MPa. The burning rate could be in-
creased by 160% at 2.0 MPa, which is slightly better than its nano-
sized counterpart is.

In the case of nAl/CuO, it can also increase the burning rate of
DB propellants at the full attempted pressure range (2–20 MPa), where
the catalytic effect is more obvious at lower pressure ranges (2–
8 MPa) with η between 1.28 and 1.45. The burning rate was increased
only 45% at 2.0 MPa, which is much smaller than nAl/PbO and mAl/
PbO. The mAl/CuO is even worse in catalytic activity than nAl/CuO.
The burning rate increased to the highest extent at lower- and higher-
pressure ranges, which is only 22% at 2 MPa and 20% at 20 MPa. This
indicates that the nAl/CuO could slightly improve the combustion
performance of DB propellants by marginally increasing the burning
rate, while the optimization of the pressure exponent is not so evident.
This is also the case for RDX-based MDB propellants when the nAl/
CuO and nAl/PbO were used as catalysts (Fig. 27). Except for nAl/
PbO and nAl/CuO, the nAl/Bi2O3 was also evaluated and compared
with nBi2O3. It has been shown in Section 3.1.1 that the increase of
burning rate by nBi2O3 is very limited with relatively low catalytic
efficiency. Compared to nBi2O3, nAl/Bi2O3 could greatly enhance the
burning rate under higher pressures, and it is particularly evident
in the pressure range of 12–18 MPa, which is even better than nAl/
PbO. Overall, the catalytic efficiency of nAl/Bi2O3 is higher than that
of nAl/PbO, which is above 1.34 in 2–20 MPa, in contrast with 1.17
for mAl/Bi2O3, resulting in the largest improvement (62%) at a

pressure of 2 MPa. Moreover, the pressure exponent n can be reduced
to 0.559 by the effect of nBi2O3 in a high-pressure range (10–
14 MPa), while the nAl/Bi2O3 can generate acceptable pressure
exponents at an even higher-pressure range (16–20 MPa). Gener-
ally speaking, nAl/Bi2O3 is not so efficient in decreasing the pressure
exponent. In conclusion, the nAl/Bi2O3 can increase the burning rate
of DB propellants, which is better than nAl/CuO but the overall cata-
lytic effect is not as good as nAl/PbO. In order to search for more
effective nanothermite catalysts, the abovementioned metal oxides
were combined together to form complex nanothermites and their
catalytic performances were evaluated [273]. The burning rate of
DB and MDB propellants under the effects of these composite
nanothermites are also summarized in Tables 14 and 16, which to-
gether with catalytic efficiency are plotted in Figs. 25 and 26 for a
convenient comparison.

As can be seen in Fig. 26, the nAl/PbO · CuO complex seems to
contribute little to improve the combustion performance, especial-
ly when it was prepared by ultrasonic dispersion method [273]. The
measured burning rate is less than the blank sample. The nAl/
PbO · CuO prepared by the solid-state reaction could slightly increase
the burning rate of the DB propellant in a lower-or higher-pressure
range. The catalytic efficiency of nAl/PbO · CuO is 1.48 at 2 MPa, where
the burning rate was increased by 48%. In comparison, the nAl/
PbO · SnO2 complex almost has no contribution to the improvement
of the burning rate no matter which method was used for prepa-
ration, resulting in very low catalytic efficiency (<1.0). In addition,
a more complex system nAl/PbO · CuO · SnO2 showed some cata-
lytic effect only in a low-pressure region, but the catalytic efficiency
is still undesirable, resulting in a 30% increase of burning rate at
2 MPa. Even the simple mechanical mixture of nAl/PbO · CuO · SnO2
has a negative effect on the burning rate of DB propellants. As a

comparison, these complex nanothermites were used in RDX-
based MDB propellants as catalysts, where the situation seems to
be better than that of pure DB propellant. The nAl/PbO · CuO pre-
pared by solid-state reaction with ultrasonic dispersion has relatively
fair catalytic effect on combustion of MDB propellants.

The catalytic efficiency of nAl/PbO · CuO is about 1.64 at 2 MPa,
where the burning rate increased by 64%. However, the catalytic ef-
ficiency was decreased with the increase of pressure. Several different
methods have been used to prepare these complex nanothermites
to improve their catalytic effects, but no obvious improvement has
been achieved. As shown in Fig. 27, their catalytic efficiency factors
on MDB propellants are lower than 1.0. In summary, the combus-
tion performance of DB and MDB propellants could be improved
by simple two-component nanothermites, especially at lower- or
higher-pressure ranges. The “synergistic effect” that works for
nanocomposite catalysts does not apply to nanothermites, where
the latter could cause even worse catalytic effects.

As shown above, the nanothermites that have been used in solid
propellants are very limited if compared with the variety of avail-
able nanothermites. Meanwhile, the currently available nanothermites
are still under fast improvements. For instance, the Bi2O3 could be
coated by nanodiamonds and then mixed with Al nanopowder
(≈100 nm) to prepare nanothermites [266], resulting in better sen-
sitivity. A composition containing around 1 wt.% of nanodiamond
has a high sensitivity threshold to friction (above 100 N) instead of
5N for the thermites without nanodiamond. The nanothermite com-
positions based on mesoporous Fe2O3 and nAl could further improve
the overall reactivity [275]. The pressure exponent is relatively small
(0.408), indicating that it might be a better catalyst of propellants
compared to the above evaluated nanothermites. Moreover, the
nanothermites can also be synthesized based on Co3O4 nanobelts
and nAl, where the Co3O4 nanobelts were prepared by a simple solid-
state process [276]. The heat of reaction has been measured to be
0.96 kJ g−1 for Co3O4/nAl (using as prepared Co3O4). In comparison,
using the calcined Co3O4 oxidizer at 400 °C, the resulting Co3O4-
400/nAl nanoenergetic is capable of developing a more reactive
combustion and generating moderate peak pressure (26 to 33 MPa).
All these newly developed nanothermites might serve as good can-
didate catalysts for DB and MDB propellants.

3.1.4. Effects of catalysts carried by carbon nanomaterials (CNMs)

It has been shown that many CNM derivatives could be used as
effective combustion catalysts [277]. The unique structure of CNMs
and their energetic derivatives can modify combustion character-
istics of propellants, especially when new functional groups or
energetic moieties are introduced to their structures. On the one
hand, such catalytic effects could be due to the special carbon struc-
ture allowing facile electron and heat transfer, promoting chemical

reactions. On the other hand, the metal oxide catalysts could be dis-
persed in the inner layer or porous structure of the CNMs. Such
dispersion can prevent an agglomeration of nanoparticles, result-
ing in more uniform catalytically active sites and thus better
combustion properties. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency could be
further improved by synergistic effects between the CNMs and the
carried catalysts. For instance, the coupled energy balance for a CNTs
with an annular coating of reactive metals is solved, where the
thermal transport in the nanotube accelerates the reaction in the
annulus. For the case of Zr metal, the CNTs increase the reaction
front velocity from 530 to 5100 mm s−1, along the axial direction
of the nanotube [278]. This remarkable result offers a proof-of-
concept for 1-D anisotropic EMs and could find application in novel
propellants. Interestingly, there are large temperature differences
(>1000 K) between the CNT and the reaction front of annulus. The
directional heat conduction in the CNTs makes the interfacial heat
conductance a less significant factor affecting the thermal energy
distribution. In addition to CTNs, graphene could also enhance the
combustion properties of propellants.

A comparative study by Sabourin’s group shows that the igni-
tion temperatures are lowered and burning rates are increased for
the colloidal suspensions of nitromethane with graphene, as com-
pared to the liquid nitromethane monopropellant alone [282].
Graphene sheet suspension in nitromethane resulted in signifi-
cantly faster burning rates for this material (i.e., >175% improvement).
It has been further reported [279] that the addition of raw fullerene
soot (FS), extracted FS (EFS), pure C60 fullerene, and CB additives to
NG markedly accelerated its liquid-phase decomposition [279]. The
effect of these nanomaterials on combustion properties of com-
posite double-base propellants (CMDB) has been also evaluated
(Table 17). The other derivatives of fullerene have even better cata-
lytic effects than C60 and CB on the combustion of DB propellants
containing RDX. As mentioned in Section 2.1.1, mNPF is a typical
example for demonstration of this effect. The burning rates of RDX-
CMDB propellants could be greatly improved by addition of mNPF,
which grows with the increase of mNPF content. The maximum
burning rate can reach up to 19.6 mm s−1, when 1.0 wt.% mNPF is
used, while the corresponding “plateau combustion” region is in the
range of 8–22 MPa [283].

Regarding applications of CNM additives as catalysts, since the
early 1960s, USA began using activated carbon (AC, processed carbon
that has small, low-volume pores with increased surface area) in
solid propellants, where Bice [284] and Ives [280] found that AC could
promote the burning rate of ammonia nitrate (AN)-based propel-
lants. These researchers also reported that a certain amount of
carborane/AC composites would increase the burning rate of the
same propellant from 5.5 to 9.2 mm s−1. Moreover, they showed that
the burning rate of aluminized composite propellants may be

increased to 25 mm s−1 at 7 MPa by using AC as a modifier [281]. A
combination of AC with Fe2O3 can make the propellant burn at a
speed of 50 mm s−1. Yet, it has a problem of unacceptable large pres-
sure exponent. Later on, it has been proven through the analysis
of the flame surface that water encapsulated in AC can reduce the
melt flow on the burning surface of the propellant, resulting in a
higher-pressure exponent [285]. Therefore, it would be better to use
water-free AC. In addition to AC, the CNTs could also increase the
burning rate of HTPB propellant by 20%, while inducing practical-
ly no effect on its pressure exponents [286].

Similar findings were observed for NEPE (nitrate ester plasti-
cized polyether) propellants, but the pressure exponent was
decreased at low-pressure ranges (e.g. <10 MPa), while it was in-
creased at a higher-pressure range (15–18 MPa) (see Fig. 28) [287].
The carbon coated Cu—Bi/CNTs and Bi/CNTs powders could func-
tion as effective catalysts for DB propellants [288,289], plateau
combustion was obtained for Cu—Bi/CNTs within a pressure of 10–
22 MPa, with a pressure exponent of 0.173. Besides, the CNTs could
also combine with the catalysts to form more effective composite
burning rate catalyzers for DB and MDB propellants. Various com-
posite catalysts based on PbO, Cu2O, CuO, Bi2O3, CB as well as their
binary systems have been prepared using CNTs and graphene oxide
(GO) as carriers in past decades [290–295]. It was indicated that CNTs,
as a carrier, can prevent aggregation of Bi2O3 or CuO nanoparticles
and improve the catalytic efficiency, resulting in a much higher
burning rate and a lower pressure exponent [291,292].

Moreover, the PbO–Cu2O could be jointly supported by CB,
forming a “Pb—Cu—CB” three-element catalytic system, so that the
burning rate of DB propellant at 2 MPa can be elevated from 2.15
to 8.57 mm s−1, with a wider “plateau combustion” pressure range
(10–20 MPa) [293]. In addition to CuO/CNTs and Bi2O3/CNTs, the Pb/
CNTs, NiB/CNTs and NiPd/CNTs were also evaluated in a comparative
study. The burning rates of DB and MDB propellants containing these
CNTs with different catalysts are plotted in Fig. 29 and the corre-
sponding pressure exponents are summarized in Table 18.

It was shown that all 10 kinds of CNT-based catalysts could in-
crease the burning rate of DB and MDB propellants, where the
composite metal oxides were used in MDB propellants. If we
compare the burning rate of DB propellants at 6 MPa, the largest
increase from 5.20 to 11.17 mm s−1 (about 114.8%) could be ob-
served when the CuO/CNTs was used. Except the NiB/CNTs, the other
CNT based catalysts can also decrease the pressure exponents. Within
a pressure range of 6–22 MPa, the CuO/CNT, Bi2O3/CNT, NiPd/CNT
catalysts reduced the n from 0.70 to 0.48, 0.53, and 0.55, respec-
tively. The CuO/CNTs has the most significant catalytic effect with
the n decrease by 31%, and “plateau combustion effect” at the pres-
sure of 16–22 MPa. In the case of MDB propellants, the catalytic
effects of Bi2O3 · SnO2/CNTs, CuO · PbO/CNTs, Cu2O · Bi2O3/CNTs,
CuO · SnO2/CNTs, and NiO · SnO2/CNTs have been evaluated. In par-
ticular, the CuO · PbO/CNTs has the best catalytic activity, and it
increased the burning rate two times with almost 50% reduction
of the pressure exponent. In addition to CNTs, the above-mentioned

metal oxides and their composites could also be carried by GO. The
obtained nanocomposites have a great effect on the combustion
properties of DB and MDB propellants (Fig. 29 and Table 19). It can
be seen that similar to CNT based catalysts, the CuO/GO could in-
crease the burning rate of DB propellant by 143% at 4 MPa, and
pressure exponent n was reduced by 50% (from 0.62 to 0.31) in the
pressure range of 10–20 MPa. In comparison, the Bi2O3/GO is slightly
less effective at increasing the burning rate (139% increase at the
same pressure), but the pressure exponent n was reduced by 59%
in the pressure range of 14–20 MPa [288]. The PbO/GO is the most
outstanding catalyst, which can induce speeding combustion phe-
nomena of both DB and MDB propellants at 2–8 MPa pressure, with
the catalytic efficiency greater than 2.4 at 2 and 4 MPa for DB pro-
pellants. The “mesa” burning zone was observed within the range
of 8–14 MPa with n of −0.15.

It is clear that the PbO/GO nanoadditive is very effective in cata-
lytic combustion. If the PbO was combined with Cu2O, the catalytic
efficiency could be further improved. As shown in Fig. 29a, the
Cu2O · PbO/GO could induce the speeding the flame spreading rate
for DB propellants within 2–14 MPa with the maximum catalytic
efficiency of 3.87 at 2 MPa. Meanwhile, the “mesa” burning ocurred
in the range of 12–20 MPa where the n is −0.05. In comparison, the
Cu2O · Bi2O3/GO could also induce a speeding combustion of the DB
propellant from 2 MPa, where the burning rate was increased from
2.15 to 8.57 mm·s−1 (299% increase) [289], with the maximum cata-
lytic efficiency of 3.99 which is the largest among all of the CNM-
based catalysts. Meanwhile, the Cu2O · Bi2O3/GO can significantly
improve the performance with a wide plateau combustion between
10–20 MPa, where n was reduced by more than 50%. More impor-
tantly, this catalyst of low toxicity could be a highly efficient
environmentally friendly combustion catalyst. As compared with
the pure metal oxides, the inclusion of GO would greatly improve
the heat conductivity and the reactive sites of the catalyst due to
well dispersion. GO itself is energetic and the heat release from the
decomposition of GO could greatly improve the reaction rate on the
burning surface. In particular, GO could improve the burning

performance of NC, which was proved by combustion behavior of
GO/NC composite materials [296]. It was found that the burning rate
of NC could be significantly increased with the increase of GO content
in GO/NC films [297]. The flame structures as well as the burning
rate of GO/NC films are presented in Fig. 30.

In the case of RDX-based MDB propellants, the catalytic com-
bustion of GO-carried metal oxides would be similar. It is shown
from Fig. 29b that the overall catalytic performance of PbO/GO on
RDX-MDB propellant is the most outstanding, whose burning rate
was significantly increased, with a largely decreased pressure ex-
ponent. The burning rate was increased from 3.09 to 6.88 mm s−1
at 2 MPa. The plateau combustion zone was observed to be in the
range of 10–20 MPa with n of 0.27. For composite metal oxide
Cu2O · PbO, when it was combined with GO, the catalytic efficien-
cy was greatly improved, resulting in speeding combustion. The
maximum catalytic efficiency in the pressure range of 2–14 MPa was
3.56, while the corresponding plateau combustion occurred in
8–18 MPa with n of 0.26. In contrast, the Cu2O · Bi2O3/GO could also
induce speeding combustion, and the burning rate was increased
by 233% (3.09 to 10.20 mm s−1) at 2 MPa. The maximum catalytic
efficiency was 3.33 between 2 and 10 MPa, and the plateau com-
bustion zone was in the range of 14–20 MPa with n of 0.21. All of
the abovementioned composite catalysts based on GO are prom-
ising for RDX-MDB propellants. As one of the most important
products from GO, functionalized graphene sheets (FGs) have been
used in monopropellant nitromethane as well [298]. It was found
that the ignition temperatures could be lowered while the burning
rates increased when the FGs were included (i.e., >175% increase).
It is still not so clear how the nanoadditives could change the
burning rate of the DB and MDB propellants. However, there are
several findings on the catalytic mechanisms. It was found that the
nano lead salt catalysts n-β-Pb and n-PhtP could shorten the de-
composition course, and accelerate the exothermic rate of energetic
matrix NC/NG as the double-base propellant. During decomposition
of NC/NG, the split of O—NO2 bond and the framework in NC/NG
matrix are facilitated. The amount of CH2O, CO and CO2 as the main

gaseous products was increased under the effect of these lead salts,
where the ratio of CH2O/NO2 was increased from 1.77 to 2.45 and
2.60, while ratio of CO/NO2 was increased from 0.071 to 0.079 and
0.090 for n-β-Pb and n-PhtP, respectively [90]. The heat release rates
were also increased from 29.5 to 31.1 and 31.4 J g−1 °C−1 by n-β-Pb
and n-PhtP, respectively. The propellant with nano lead phthalate
has the fastest heat release rate, and the largest production of CH2O
and CO, resulting in the highest burning rate. It might be the case
for all catalysts, which are able to increase the burning rate, that if
the production of CH2O and CO were increased, where CH2O could
react with NO2 as a catalyzer and CO could undergo a fast gas-
phase combustion reaction, it would result in a larger heat feedback
and a higher burning rate.

3.2. Combustion of AP-based composite propellants

3.2.1. Effect of nanometal oxides

The combustion characteristics of AP-based composite propel-
lants were extensively studied by many researchers in order to
achieve a higher specific impulse and lower pressure exponent [299].
The thrust profile depends on the grain design, which is mainly de-
termined by the propellant compositions and the manufacturing
processes. The analysis covers the main ingredients of AP-based pro-
pellants such as the binders (usually HTPB, GAP), oxidizers, metal
fuels, plasticizers, and burning rate modifiers. Similar to DB and MDB
propellants, the burning rate and corresponding pressure expo-
nents could be modified by the addition of nanoadditives as well
[300]. The burning rate of AP composite propellants also depends
on the content of AP, and its particle sizes [301–303], as well as the
binder type, if the metal fuel was fixed [304]. As described in Sections
2.1.3 and 2.2.2, the nanoadditives played a significant role in accel-
erating the decomposition of AP, where the heat releases were greatly
improved. These additives would greatly affect the combustion prop-
erties of AP-based propellants. The combustion behavior of AP-
based propellants under the effects of catalyst additives, mainly the
metal oxides, has been extensively carried out [124,303–315]. As
mentioned earlier, the most widely used metal oxides are Fe2O3 [305],
TiO2 [306], and CuO [118–120], with HTPB as the popular binder
[122]. Fe2O3 has been found to be the most widely used catalyst in
commercial AP-based composite propellants due to its low cost, facile
manufacturing process, high stability/inertness, and capability of
generating higher reproducible burning rates [308]. The depen-
dence of their catalytic effects on the particle sizes of the catalyst

was found to be significant, where the smaller particles (e.g.,
nanoparticles) with higher SSA have better catalytic activity [309].
The metal nanoadditives such as nAl and their particle size distri-
butions also greatly affect the burning rate [316,317]. It was shown
that Al nanoparticles can increase the burning rate of AP/HTPB/Al
propellants up to 100% when compared to micron-sized Al par-
ticles [318].

In the case of nanoadditives as catalysts, first we could discuss
some issues on nTiO2, which has a strong catalytic effect on the de-
composition of AP as shown in Section 2.1.3. The effect of nTiO2
catalyst in terms of its SSA on the thermal decomposition proper-
ties of AP was examined. It was shown that TiO2 consisting of anatase
and brookite phases could greatly change the frequency factor of
AP decomposition, even though there was little effect on its Ea [126].
The catalytic effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the LTD peak of AP was
probably due to the presence of the cations and anions on the surface
of such transitional metal oxides, acting as acid–base site pairs and
adsorbing gaseous reactive molecules formed during the LTD of AP
[127]. In fact, the different phases of nTiO2 have different catalytic
effects on the burning rate of AP-based propellants [319]. As shown
in Fig. 31b, the plateau combustion could be achieved by adding 0.5%
anatase nTiO2, while the rutile phase behaves very similarly to the
amorphous one.

It can also be seen in Fig. 31 that all three TiO2 phases could in-
crease the burning rates, and the propellants containing anatase
exhibited two distinct regions: from 30–60 bar, the burning rates
increased exponentially with pressure, but from 60–200 bar, the
burning rate was constant. The calculated values of a (in cm s−1) and
n were 0.63 and 0.10 for the blank propellant, 0.44 and 0.31 for amor-
phous TiO2, 0.48 and 0.27 for rutile, while they were 0.20 and 0.80
for the anatase pre-plateau region, and 0.83 and 0.0052 for the
anatase plateau combustion. These results correspond to a maximum
burning rate increase of 30% for each additive phase [320]. Even TiO2
has similar promising catalytic activity. Nonetheless, to achieve ho-
mogeneous dispersion of nTiO2 in polymer binders is still challenging.
Therefore, one of the best strategies to solve this problem is to make
a polymer-based nanocomposite with nTiO2. It was reported that
the polyurethane (PU)–TiO2 composite could be prepared by an in-
situ synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles in a solution of the HTPB pre-
polymer, resulting in a uniform dispersion of mesoporous anatase
nTiO2 with minimal agglomeration in HTPB [321].

As shown in Fig. 32, the PU–TiO2 nanocomposite demonstrates
substantially higher activity as combustion catalysts when compared

to pure nTiO2 incorporated into polyurethane by conventional
powder or solution mixing methods. The red color symbols and
curves in Fig. 32 represent the burning rate data of the propel-
lants containing (a) 80 wt.% of monomodal AP at 200 μm and 0.5 wt.%
of in-situ PU–TiO2 and (b) 85 wt.% of bimodal AP with 0.3% or 0.1%
in-situ PU–TiO2 composite. The burning rates of propellants con-
taining 1% powder-melt and solution-mixed TiO2 and a baseline for
blank propellant without TiO2 are shown for a comparison. It is clear
that the in-situ PU–TiO2 resulted in significantly higher burning rates
than those of the other TiO2 nanoparticles, despite being present
for only half the amount. The average burning rate increase over
the reference propellant was 101% for in-situ TiO2, compared to 59%
and 34% for nTiO2 mixed by the solution and powder methods, re-
spectively. When the content of in-situ TiO2 decreases to 0.3% and
0.1%, the increase in burning rates was reduced to 63% and 77%, re-
spectively [321]. This indicates that the in-situ TiO2 nanoparticles
exhibited much higher activity as combustion catalysts when

compared to nTiO2 particles incorporated by conventional methods.
The mesoporous structure of the anatase nTiO2 grown in the polymer
solution may enhance their catalytic activity due to increase of SSA.
The cook-off tests showed that the in-situ nTiO2 could improve
the safety of the propellants even when using a very small amount,
while the burning surface analysis showed that the nTiO2 catalyst
increased the burning rate, but did not change the burning surface
structure [322]. The catalytic activity of nTiO2 could be further im-
proved by combining it with graphene. A green process was
developed to synthesize graphene–TiO2 nanocomposite (GTNC) via
ultrasonication followed by microwave irradiation [323]. About 1 wt.%
of this nanocomposite was used in a metalized composite propel-
lant containing the bimodal AP (52.5% 300 μm plus 15.6% 50 μm),
18 wt.% of Al, and 3% dioctyl adipate, bonded by 10.1% of HTPB. First,
the 5 wt.% of GTNC in AP was found to be a highly effective at cata-
lytic decomposition by decreasing the HTD peak temperature from
412.9 to 372.5 °C with a heat release increase from 2053 to 3903 J g−1,

resulting in a 50% burning rate increase. It is useful to note that the
increase was 24% for the normal nTiO2 catalyst under the same
conditions.

Regarding nCuO, refer to Section 2.1.3, the CuO nanocrystals ex-
hibited a particular chemical reactivity and strong catalytic activity
on AP due to their high concentration of dislocations and large SSA
[119]. It was also demonstrated that the nCuO could enhance the
burning rates of AP-based composite propellants [324]. The solid
composite propellants with CuO microparticles are less stable due
to oversensitivity to pressure variations, but the composite propel-
lant nCuO yields highly stable burning rates over a broad range of
pressure. In addition, the incorporation of CuO nanoparticles also
improves their combustion and thermal properties, where the par-
ticle size distribution of nCuO also affects the burning rate of AP-
based propellants. In particular, the burning properties of the
composite propellants containing nCuO in different sizes have been
evaluated [325,326]. The composition of the composite propellant
includes 66% AP (bimodal: 1/1 of 200 μm and 6 μm), 15% Al, 2%
burning rate catalyst, which can be either nCuO-1 (11 nm) or nCuO-2
(44 nm), and 17% of the binder, composed of 13.9% HTPB, 2.17% of
dioctyl adipate as a plasticizer, and 0.05% of antioxidant (Irganox
565). With the addition of mesoporous fillers of nCuO, higher rates
were found over a broad pressure range with greater than 22 mm s−1
at 7 MPa, and considerably reduced pressure exponents (0.40 vs.
0.55).

Moreover, in order to evaluate the effect of the nCuO catalyst
dispersibility on the energy generation of the composite propel-
lants, its heat of combustion in oxygen and heat of explosion under
nitrogen were measured. With pre-dispersing procedures, the de-
composition temperature of nCuO/AP and its propellant are about
25 °C and 8.6 °C lower than that of AP/CuO simple mixture and cor-
responding composite propellants as mentioned above, respectively.
Compared to simply mixed propellants using CuO with 3 hours of
kneading, the combustion and explosion heat of the propellant with
pre-dispersed nCuO/AP were increased about 1.4 and 1.7 times, re-
spectively [118]. In addition to nTiO2 and nCuO, as shown above,
the most widely used combustion catalyst in composite propel-
lants should be Fe2O3 and related materials such as ferrocene that
could generate Fe2O3 during combustion. A comparative study on
catalytic effects of nanometer to submicron size Fe2O3 on combus-
tion of AP-HTPB propellants has been performed [327]. It was shown
that nFe2O3 has a better catalytic activity on combustion of AP, re-
gardless of the particle sizes of AP.

As mentioned above, in many cases it is better to use bimodal
AP particles for an improved combustion performance [303]. The
content of AP (particles sizes, 4 and 110 μm) has a great effect on
the burning characteristics of its propellants, as shown in Fig. 33.
It can be seen from Fig. 33 that the burning rate is reduced by using

CAP instead of FAP (contrast Fig. 33a to Fig. 33c) and in both cases
deflagration limits are reached when the AP mass fraction is too low:
without nFe2O3 catalyst, the minimum content for self-sustained
burning is 55% and 63% respectively for CAP and FAP. However, when
the nFe2O3 is used, the deflagration limits goes down to 52% for CAP
(with less than 50% CAP did not burn in the tested pressure range
0.5–7 MPa) and 35% for FAP without flameout problems at any pres-
sure [327]. This confirms that the smaller AP particles impart faster
burning rates than the coarse ones and also indicates the addition
of nFe2O3 catalyst is favorable to the burning performance of AP-
based propellants in terms of higher burning rate and extended
deflagration limits. An additional effect observed in this respect by
Bandera et al. [328] is that 0.2% of NanoCat (a kind of nFe2O3 pro-
duced by MACH I) is effective in appreciably reducing the incipient
agglomeration of bimodal AP/HTPB/Al formulations occurring at/
near the propellant burning surface [329].

In the case of nFe2O3 catalyst, as for all reacting particles its ac-
tivity is also dependent on the morphology (this effect is also known
as shape factor). Four kinds of nFe2O3 catalysts were prepared (60–
80 nm, Fig. 33) [330] and it was found that nFe2O3 (II) with a regular
with sphere is the best catalyst out of these four morphologies
(Fig. 34). Under the effect of nFe2O3 (II), the burning rate of AP-
HTPB propellant could achieve 43.2 mm s−1 with the lowest pressure
exponent being 0.27 at 6.86 MPa (Table 20). The impact energy for
H50 was about 14 J, indicating that the safety is at the same level
to the propellant with ordinary Fe2O3.

Further investigation showed that nano α-Fe2O3 exhibits a better
performance than the amorphous one in the catalytic combustion
of the composite propellant [331]. A polymer citrate precursor
method (a combustion process) was developed for large-scale syn-
thesis of nano α-Fe2O3 using iron nitrate as the starting material.
It was indicated that the use of nano α-Fe2O3 in composite propel-
lant resulted in more than a 50% increase in its burning rate. As
shown above, the nano-sized catalysts are expected to be more ef-
fective than their micron-sized counterparts due to higher SSA and
more contact points with the oxidizer. However, the processing of
propellants became more difficult and corresponding mechanical
properties were negatively impacted as the size of the catalyst was
reduced. A proposed solution to this problem was to encapsulate
a nano-sized catalyst inside the oxidizer [332]. The effect of the en-
capsulated composite nFe2O3 particles on the burning rate and flame
structure of an AP-based composite propellant was explored. The
propellant containing 40% of the composite nFe2O3/AP particles was
compared to one blank reference propellant (40% of coarse AP, 40%
of fine AP, bonded by 20% binder, which was composed of 14.58%
RM-45, 2.92% IDP, and 2.30% E744 curing agent), one formulated
with micron-sized Fe2O3 catalyst (0.21%), and another one with reg-
ularly mixed nFe2O3 catalyst (0.21%). High-speed (5 kHz) OH planar

laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and high-speed surface imaging
were used to examine differences in their flame structure and coarse
crystal burning characteristics. It was found that the burning rate
of the propellant with the encapsulated catalyst was 90% higher than
that of the baseline propellant, 44% higher than the propellant with
micron-scale catalyst, and 15% higher than that of the propellant
with nano-sized catalyst added directly (Fig. 35). This indicates that
the high burning rate of the propellants with the encapsulated cat-
alyst is due to accelerated burning of fine AP/binder matrix caused
by the intimate contact between the fine AP and the catalyst. The
pressure exponent of the propellants containing micron-sized mFe2O3
is greater than that of the one containing nano-sized nFe2O3 and
the encapsulated catalyst. The dependence of the pressure expo-
nent on the particle size of the Fe2O3 catalyst has been observed
previously [333,334]. The decrease in the exponent is attributed to
the burning rate enhancement at lower pressure ranges, which is
also the case for DB and MDB propellants under the effects of
nanometal oxides (Section 3.1.1).

In terms of the flame structure of AP-based propellants under
the effect of nFe2O3 catalyst, at elevated pressures (4.4–7.1 atm), the
flame structure and burning surface morphology depend on the par-
ticle size of AP and location of the catalyst. The coarse crystals are
observed to protrude more from the burning surface as the cata-
lyst size decreases (Fig. 36f–k). As shown in Fig. 36 (l) and (m), the
flame heights of the propellants are different for various Fe2O3
(micron-, nano-, and encapsulated nFe2O3) particles; but they are
almost the same at 1 atm. For a given pressure above 1 atm, the flame
heights of the jet-like flames are the same for all propellants, while
the arched flames are in general much taller than jet-like flames
[332]. For the blank propellant, its jet-like flame would transfer to
an arched flame at a lower pressure than the other propellants, while

most of the flames are arched at 4.4 atm. For the micron- and nano-
catalyzed propellants, the arched flames become more prevalent
at elevated pressures. The encapsulated catalyst propellant, on the
other hand, has constant flame heights at pressures above 1 atm,
as there were hardly any arched flames being observed compared
to the other propellants. Similar phenomena were observed from
the successive combustion images for three propellant samples con-
taining nano- or micron-sized Fe2O3 catalyst [335]. The images taken
at 1.96 MPa are shown in Fig. 37, depicting that the combustion in-
tensity of the composites B1 and B2 with nFe2O3 powder is much
stronger than that of the one with solely micro-sized Fe2O3. In terms
of flame stability, the propellant containing only nFe2O3 (B2) has the
most stable combustion process in spite of having the highest
burning rate (e.g., 38.2 mm s−1 at 9.8 MPa) [333]. This reveals that
the combination of micron- and nano-sized catalysts would not
improve the combustion performance as it does for the combina-
tion of the oxidizer AP with nano- and micron-sized additives.

Interestingly, as the source of Fe2O3, the Fe nanoparticles can also
generate heat during combustion that could be more advanta-
geous as additives to AP composite propellants. The nFe typically
underwent oxidation during the manufacturing process, resulting
in an oxidized shell of Fe2O3 with a thickness of 2–4 nm (Fig. 33f)
[336,337]. First, the oxidized Fe2O3 shell of nFe will be involved in
the initial catalytic decomposition of AP at the propellant-burning
surface. Then, the melting of the inner nFe core could be easier com-
pared to that of bulk Fe due to protection exclusion of high-
melting point Fe2O3 shell [338]. The burning characteristics of
composite propellants containing 1% Fe nanoparticles have been
compared with the blank propellant (Fig. 38) [339].

It can be seen from Fig. 38 that the burning rate of AP-based pro-
pellant was enhanced by the effect of nFe particles. In all attempted

pressures, the addition of 1% nFe results in a burning rate that is ap-
proximately 1.6 times greater than the blank reference sample. At a
higher pressure range (3–10 MPa), the burning rate enhancement is
reduced, with 1.2 times enhancement at 10 MPa [339]. However, the
mechanism responsible for the reduction in burning rate enhancement
at higher pressures is still not clear. It was hypothesized that the result
was due to a change of flame structure at higher pressures, where
the diffusion of the oxidizer and fuel species became rate limiting
[340], resulting in a weak catalytic effect of Fe2O3 shell on thermal
decomposition of AP. The comparable burning rate enhancement
for Fe and Fe2O3 suggests a similar mechanism for burning rate

enhancement. In addition to nFe, the ferrocene derivatives can also
serve as the source of Fe2O3 during combustion of AP-based propellants.
The combustion of AP-based propellants using hydrocarbon as
binders, diethylferrocene, 1,1′-bis (dimethyloctyloxysilyl) ferro-
cene, as well as nFe2O3 as catalysts for a comparison was studied. It
has been shown that the efficiency of ferrocene compounds from
the viewpoint of increasing the burning rate depends on the oxidizer/
fuel ratio in the propellant and on the location of the leading
combustion reaction [341].

It was suggested that the combustion of composites propellants
with higher oxidizer/fuel ratios would follow a gas-phase model,

resulting in lower catalytic efficiency. In lower oxidizer/fuel ratio
systems, the contribution of condensed-phase reactions to the burning
rate of the system is dominant, resulting in noticeably greater
catalytic efficiency. The catalytic efficiency is directly related to the
possibility of soot skeleton formation. As is seen in Fig. 39a, the ad-
dition of 1 and 3% of ferrocenes to the basic composition leads to
an increase in the burning rate, but the catalytic effect is not so
significant, which decreases with the increase of pressure, similar
as nFe [339]. It was shown in Fig. 39b that complete replacement

of the hydrocarbon binder by ferrocene in the stoichiometric com-
position leads to an increase of 1.8 mm/s in the burning rate. A similar
effect was reached by adding a considerably smaller amount of the
catalyst (e.g. 0.1%), indicating that the increase in the burning rate
was not only due to the contribution of the fast oxidation reaction
of the ferrocene fragment. If we look at the catalysis of propellants
with a lower oxidizer/fuel ratio (e.g., α = 0.289, Fig. 39c), where 60%
of AP with the mean particle size of 11 μm was used as the oxi-
dizer, it is clear that the content of catalyst Fe2O3 has little effect on

the burning rate. Combustion of uncured AP mixtures with a hy-
drocarbon binder based on the SKN-18-1 KTR rubber plasticized by
dioctyl sebacate was studied as a function of the content and par-
ticle size of AP [342]. Stable combustion of this propellant begins
at 2.0 MPa (Fig. 39b), the burning rate in the entire range of pres-
sures examined is substantially lower than the burning rate of pure
AP, and the calculated burning temperature was only 1400 K. The
burning rate does not depend on the particle size of AP [342]. Non-
catalyzed mixtures based on two kinds of binders (B-1 and B-2) with
60% of AP have very close burning rates (Fig. 39b and d).

There is only a slight difference in the pressure exponents at high
pressures: a transitional regime is observed for the mixture with
the B-1 binder, and a new combustion regime with a low depen-
dence on pressure was established for the mixture with the B-2
binder. Such a dependence of the burning rate on pressure is well
explained by a simple model including oxidizer particle combus-
tion and binder interlayer gasification [343]. The model implies that
most of the combustion time was occupied by the gasification of
the binder interlayer at high pressures, while the gasification is
weakly dependent on pressure. The behavior of propellants based
on the B-2 binder with the addition of ferrocene catalysts is dif-
ferent from the previously investigated compositions. When the

fraction of ferrocene catalyst increases to 15%, the dependence tends
to be smoothed (Fig. 39d). The burning rates of the mixtures at high
pressures are close to the burning rates of similar mixtures based
on the B-1 binder. The moderate efficiency of ferrocenes is caused
both by a moderate contribution of the heat release kinetics and
by a short lifetime of the soot skeleton in such propellants. The pres-
ence of such soot skeleton with large surface area may provide active
catalytic reaction sites for the diffused fuel molecule combustion.
In systems with a low oxidizer/fuel ratio and a significant contri-
bution of condensed-phase reactions to the burning rate of the
system, the efficiency reached 6 times for Fe2O3 and 10–14 times
for ferrocenes [343]. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency of ferro-
cene continued to increase with an increase of ferrocene content,
which was due to the fact that the contribution of heat release from
the fast oxidation reaction of ferrocene becomes more and more
significant. The close values of the catalytic activity of ferrocenes
and Fe2O3, in the case of small contents, reveal that the main con-
tribution to increasing the propellant burning rate is made by Fe2O3
formed by rapid oxidation of ferrocene on the AP surface and ac-
cumulated on the soot skeleton [341].

In addition to the abovementioned three typical metal oxides,
there are some other nanometal oxides such as nCo3O4 that have

been investigated in terms of their combustion catalytic effects on
AP-based propellants. The Co3O4 nano-particles were prepared by
means of solid-phase synthetic method. It was shown that the cata-
lytic effect of nCo3O4 on the fuel-rich propellant is stronger than
micron-sized Co3O4 particles and nCuO nano-particles [344]. The
results of the catalytic effects of the other nanometal oxides are only
available for thermal decomposition of AP, which has been dis-
cussed in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.2.2. The catalytic effect of these metal
oxides on combustion of AP is not available in the literature. This
may be due to the difficulty in their large-scale preparation (e.g.,
CNMs carried catalysts) therefore making them inadequate to be
used in propellant charges for burning rate tests. Also, some of them
are not so effective in catalytic decomposition of AP, and hence no
further investigations on catalytic combustion have been attempted.

3.2.2. Effect of nanometal composites and salts

Similar to the catalytic effect of metal oxides, the metal salts also
make great catalysts for the decomposition and combustion of AP.
There are a variety of metal salts that have been used in the cata-
lytic decomposition of AP such as PbCO4, FeCO4, CoCO4, NiCO4, LaFeO3,
LaCoO3, CuCrO3, LaNiO3, and many others as shown in Table 4. Most
of the metal salts could greatly improve the decomposition rate of
AP with lower activation energy and exothermic peak tempera-
ture. However, the available literature showed that the metal salts
that are used for catalytic combustion of AP-based propellants are
very limited, where PbCO4, CuCrO3, and some perovskite-type salts
attracted more attention.

It was reported that the nPbCO3 powders that have an average
size of 20 nm could increase the burning rate of the AP-based pro-
pellant by 12.0% on average, while the pressure exponent n could
be decreased by 11.5%, when comparing them to the micron-sized
PbCO3 powders [345]. However, smaller particle sizes would result
in a slightly lower burning rate and pressure exponent when the
nano PbCO3 powders are used (Table 21). The nPbCO3 is usually com-
patible with nitrate ester, and it has observable acceleration on the
thermal decomposition of nitramines as well as on the curing re-
action, but it has little effect on AP decomposition. Nevertheless,
it has a great effect on the combustion of AP-based NEPE propel-
lants, where the n could be effectively brought from 0.57 down to
0.54 and 0.52 when 1% and 2% of nPbCO3 was used, respectively
[346]. The increase of nPbCO3 content could decrease the pressure
exponent, but then the burning rate would also be decreased [347].
It was shown that the nPbCO3 can reduce the pressure exponent
from 0.54 to 0.19 in the pressure ranges of 4–10 MPa (Table 21). The
combustion efficiency and the heat of explosion increased when the

content of the nPbCO3 was increased. However, the content of the
catalysts in general cannot be increased without limitations in order
to maintain the energy content of the propellants. It was found that
the suitable weight fraction of nano-carbonate catalyst in the pro-
pellants should be 0.5%–1.0% [347].

Another widely used metal salt, which is called Cu—Cr—O
nanocomposites (e.g. CuCrO3), can also be used in catalytic com-
bustion of AP-based propellants [346]. The phase structure of the
as-prepared Cu—Cr—O nanocomposites depends on the Cu/Cr molar
ratio in the starting materials. These nanocomposites could con-
siderably enhance the burning rate and decrease the pressure
exponent of AP-based propellants. The Cu—Cr—O nanocomposites
with a Cu/Cr molar ratio of 0.7 could generate the most stable com-
bustion [348]. It also exhibits the most promising catalytic activity
with high burning rate and low pressure exponent at all attempted
pressures, due to the effective-phase interaction between the spinel
CuCr2O4 and delafossite CuCrO2 contained in the as-prepared
Cu—Cr—O nanocomposites [349]. Fig. 40 shows the pressure de-
pendence of burning rates for the solid propellants containing
the Cu—Cr—O nanocomposite catalysts. For comparison, results of
the blank propellants without any catalysts and those using the
Cu—Cr—O composites prepared by the conventional solid- state
method are included (the pressure exponents, preparation method
and corresponding particle sizes of the catalysts are shown in the
right side of Fig. 40).

It can be seen from Fig. 39 that the inclusion of Cu—Cr—O com-
posites could greatly increase the burning rate of the propellants
at all attempted pressures, with significantly reduced n. However,
the as-obtained Cu—Cr—O nanocomposites via Pechini method
(samples 2–10) are much better than the Cu—Cr—O composites via
solid-state approach (sample 11) in improving the burning rate and
reducing the pressure exponent. Noticeably, the sample with a Cu/
Cr molar ratio of 0.7 (sample 7) exhibits a relatively high burning
rate as well as the lowest pressure exponent (0.43), which makes
it the most stable combustion at all pressures. When fixing the Cu/
Cr molar ratio at 0.5, with the increase of calcination temperature,
the burning rate progressively decreases. In case of n, it decreases
first (before 700 °C from 0.60 to 0.55) and then increases (after 700 °C
from 0.55 to 0.64). When the calcination temperature was con-
stant at 700 °C, the burning rate at low pressures gradually increased
and then decreased with the increase of Cu/Cr molar ratio from 0.3
to 1.0. Although the n shows a random relationship with the Cu/
Cr molar ratio, it first decreases with the increase of Cu/Cr molar
ratio (from 0.3 to 0.7) and then increases afterwards. As one of the
typical Cu—Cr—O composites, the Cu2Cr2O5 has a SSA of 19.7 m2 g−1

and a pore volume (PV) of 0.08 mL g−1 [350]. The burning rate of
AP/HTPB propellant (86% solid content) containing only 1% of
Cu2Cr2O5 was increased from 15.88 to 17.78 mm s−1 at the pres-
sure of 6 MPa with almost identical n (0.41 vs 0.40), when compared
with the blank sample. When it was incorporated to SiO2, forming
a Cu2Cr2O5/SiO2 composite, its catalytic activity was greatly im-
proved due to a significant increase in SSA to 76.1 m2 g−1 and PV to
0.32 mL g−1. The corresponding burning rate was further increased
to 18.56 mm s−1 with a much lower n of 0.35 [350]. In addition to
the as-prepared Cu—Cr—O composites, the commercially avail-
able copper chromites are also great burning rate catalysts for the
combustion of composite solid propellants. These copper was gen-
erated during decomposition chromites with diverse chemical
composition and SSA have different catalytic activities. It was found
that some of them SX14 (Cu/Cr = 35.6%/25.5%), Cu-0202P (Cu/
Cr = 63.5%/10%) and Cu-1800P (Cu/Cr = 38.3%/31.3%) are even better
than nFe2O3 in terms of burning rate enhancement [351]. More-
over, the mechanical properties of the aluminized AP/HTPB were
not substantially affected by the type of copper chromite.

Compared with basic propellant, the burning rate of propellant
modified by 1% LaCoO3 nanocrystals increases around 8%. The ex-
perimental results indicate that LaCoO3 is obviously a more effective
catalyst than LaFeO3 and LaNiO3. As mentioned in Section 2.1.3, the
addition of LaCoO3 lowers the decomposition temperature of AP and
increases the decomposition rate with a higher heat release, re-
sulting in the complete decomposition in lower temperatures with
a shorter time, when compared to LaFeO3 and LaNiO3 [130]. Or-
thorhombic structure perovskite ErCrO3 nanocrystals, which were
prepared by glycine combustion method, have an intense cata-
lytic effect on the decomposition of AP [352]. Adding 2% of ErCrO3
to AP can decrease the decomposition temperature by 82 °C. More
importantly, the gaseous products of AP decomposition were
more diverse than those without catalyst. The gaseous products
included are NH3, H2O, O2, HCl, NO, HNO, N2O, NO2, and Cl2. The
mechanism of catalytic action is based on the presence of super-
oxide ion (O2−) and oxygenic ion (O−) on the surface of ErCrO3, and
they can accelerate the thermal decomposition process of AP due
to faster oxidation of NH3, which is the reason for the burning rate
enhancement. Alternatively, the cubic pyrochlore type NdxCo2−xZr2O7
nano-crystals with particle sizes of 0.306, 0.265, 0.188, and 0.160 nm
were prepared by KCl-assistant glycine solution combustion method
(SGCM), using neodymium nitrate, cobalt nitrate, and zirconium
nitrate as raw materials, and glycine as the incendiary agent [353].
With the addition of 2% of nano NdxCo2−xZr2O7, the exothermic peak

temperature of AP was decreased by nearly 88 °C, while the appar-
ent decomposition heat was increased from 655 to 1073 J g−1. This
means the nano cobalt-doped zirconium acid neodymium is better
than the single component of nanometal oxides and undoped
zirconate neodymium nanocrystals [354]. However, the catalytic
combustion properties of corresponding AP-based propellants are
not available in the literature.

Similar to DB and MDB propellants, the nanothermites can also
be used as burning rate catalysts for AP-based composite propel-
lants. The Al-based nanothermites would burn more efficiently with
less agglomeration and post-combustion aggregates as it does for
the pure nAl additive. Moreover, the surfaces of the metal par-
ticles or nanothermites can be coated with oxidant AP using the
electrospray technique [354]. For instance, highly reactive Al-
based composites were obtained by assembling nAl and nAl/CuO
into microparticles and then coated with AP for gas generation to
prevent possible sintering during preparation. It was shown that
the peak pressure and the pressurization rate of Al/CuO/AP is more
than three times higher and faster, when compared to the physi-
cally mixed Al/CuO nanothermites, which is very promising as the
main ingredient of composite propellants or solid fuel air explo-
sives [354]. The CuO can also combine with the other metal oxides
to enhance the catalytic activity. When we compared the catalytic
activity of nCuO, Fe2O3, and CuO/Fe2O3 on decomposition and com-
bustion of AP/HTPB propellant, the order of the catalytic efficiency
on decomposition was found to be: nCuO/Fe2O3 > nCuO > Fe2O3. It
attributes to the synergistic effect of combined catalyst. The burning
rate of propellants modified by 1% of CuO/Fe2O3 was increased
around 55% comparing to the blank propellant [355]. In addition
to metal oxides, meal salts, nanothermites and their complexes, more
importantly, the addition of nanometal particles can greatly improve
the decomposition rate and heat releases of AP (Section 2.1.3). It
was shown that the metal particles would act as fuels and then serves
as the catalysts after oxidation on the burning surface or in the gas-
phase flame zone [30,31]. The combustion process of propellants
with nanometal particle is much more complicated, which have
been extensively investigated, especially on nAl, boron and Zr
[32,33,46,356]. The nano materials in general would improve the
combustion performance of composite propellants, even the nano-
sized AP would use together with nAl to further enhance the burning
rate [357]. In this review article, due to length limitations, the de-
tailed summary on a large amount of literature regarding ignition,
combustion of nanometal particles, and corresponding AP-based
composite propellants will not be included herein, which would

126

deserve a separate review. In order to gather key information, the
agglomeration processes of the nanometal particles and their effects
on the condensed-phase products as well as the burning charac-
teristics of the propellants should be specified. In fact, regarding the
combustion of nanometals (mainly nAl, Mg, Cu and Zr), one could
refer a comprehensive review written by Dreizin [38]. Regarding the
other metals, such as nCo [358], nNi [359–361], nAlH3 [362], and
many others based on carbon nanomaterials including GO and CNTs,
the burning characteristics in solid propellants have not been well
described, and more research work will be needed in the future.
As indicated earlier, the CNTs have a strong catalytic effect on the
decomposition of AP, and it is also a promising combustion cata-
lyst for AP. It was proven that with the increase of CNT content, the
burning rate of AP composites would increase with a lower pres-
sure exponent (n) [143]. In fact, the nCu/CNTs and nNi/CNTs
composite catalysts have similar catalytic effect on AP/HTPB pro-
pellants [110,111]. In general, the use of modified CNMs can improve
the combustion properties of propellants and the CNMs that carried
nanomaterials (e.g., metal oxides, nano rare earth materials and nano
AP) can greatly increase the burning rates and the energy release
rate of solid propellants [363–365]. For instance, the MWCNTs can
be used in composition with porous silicon (pSi), impregnated with
sodium perchlorate, and it allows pSi to easily undergo explosion
[366].

3.2.3. General catalytic combustion mechanisms of
AP-based propellants

Since the composite propellant systems are multi-component,
the combustion process must start from the interaction of the com-
ponents. A complete model that can describe the real combustion
process should be based on the basic kinetic and thermodynamic
data of the interactions of these components. Lengelle et al. de-
scribed the combustion physics and chemistry of AP/HTPB
propellants, where they believed that the interaction between the
O2 generated by AP and the inert alkane binders promoted the deg-
radation of the bonding agent, resulting in an enhanced burning rate
[30]. It was found by Korobeinichev that the decomposition of
gaseous products of AP/HTPB does not contain HClO4, which was
generated during decomposition for AP alone (Section 2.3.2). It means
that the NH3 and decomposition products of HTPB would react with
thermolysis products of HClO4 [51], which is the dominant reac-
tion in the flame zone of this composite propellant. He believes that
the burning rate of AP/HTPB propellant is higher than that of the
AP monopropellant due to the interaction of AP and HTPB. A com-
prehensive theoretical/numerical model for treating AP/HTPB
composite-propellant combustion in a rocket-motor environment
has been proposed [336,367]. The formulation takes into account

the conservation equations in both the gas and condensed phases,
and accommodates finite-rate chemical kinetics and variable
thermophysical properties.

The processes in the two phases are coupled at the surface to
determine the propellant burning behavior. An asymptotic analy-
sis based on a large activation-energy approximation for the
condensed-phase decomposition is applied to help resolve the com-
bustion wave structure in the interfacial layer. A simplified global
reaction is employed to characterize the final diffusion flame between
the decomposition products of AP and the pyrolysis products of HTPB
(Fig. 41), where only laminar flows are considered in order to avoid
complications associated with turbulence. It was found that the
burning rate could be increased in a crossflow due to turbulence
effects, and this phenomenon can be modeled by means of a second-
and a first-order closure scheme, respectively [33,368]. These clo-
sures represent a flux in terms of the mean variables, which is simple
and popular, though it has well-known inaccuracies for convec-
tive boundary layers. The former approach is highly idealized and
not representative of the typical flame structures for composite pro-
pellants. The latter assumed diffusion-controlled reaction rates in
the gas-phase and neglected the multi-flame structure inherent in
the combustion of composite propellants. Moreover, the gas-
phase heat release is totally controlled by the eddy breakup process.
A detailed kinetic two-dimensional (DK2D) model, including de-
tailed kinetics and species transport, was used to identify the
combustion trends in AP/HTPB propellants [369]. This model has
been applied to 27 different AP/HTPB formations including mono-,
bi-, and trimodal propellants, where 90% of the predictions have
fallen within 20% of experimental data. In addition, a coupled micron
and meso-scale combustion simulation could give a more theoret-
ically based and accurate description for AP/HTPB combustion, where
a new four-step kinetic mechanism was implemented into the meso-
scale model [370]. Compared to the fully coupled approach, a 1-D
correlation may reduce the computational resource requirements
with less accuracy. This was used to determine the detailed com-
bustion kinetics and reaction mechanisms of AP/HTPB, where the
reaction mechanism comprised 37 species and 127 reaction steps
[371]. The modeling of AP/HTPB combustion under the effect of
nanoadditives would be more challenging and currently most of
the results are simply based on the phenomenological description
[372]. To improve the accuracy of the model under the effect of
nanoadditives, a parametric study was conducted by systematical-
ly varying different aspects of the burning process that are covered
by a simple model using a TiO2-based additive as an example [373].
This showed that the nano catalysts could primarily impact the
condensed-phase by increasing the reaction rate of the condensed-
phase AP, as described in the catalytic decomposition mechanisms

of AP. Recently, an artificial neural network was developed to sim-
ulate the combustion of AP under the effect of Cu—Cr—O
nanocomposites. A calculation model has been established to iden-
tify the primary combustion characteristics based on back
propagation neural networks. The model was subsequently
validated and then used to predict the primary combustion char-
acteristics of the AP-based propellant. It was revealed that the error
of burning rate calculation using this model is less than ±5% and
the variations of the calculation results were consistent with those
of the experimental results.

This review paper is mainly concerned with the burning rate and
pressure exponent of solid propellants under the effect of various
nanoadditives. In the case of AP-based propellants, the situation is
more complicated. In order to figure out how the nanoadditives play
the role of catalyst combustion of AP-based propellants, many efforts
have been devoted to the establishment of the catalytic mecha-
nisms of these additives [110,111,327,374–377], and a variety of
catalytic combustion mechanisms based on experimental findings
have been proposed, which are summarized in the following para-
graphs. The mechanisms were proposed according to the following
general steps: find out the location of the catalytic reaction (con-
densed phase or gas phase) → determine the type catalytic reaction
and how it interacts with reactants → estimate all possible reac-
tion pathways and corresponding thermodynamic parameters. It is
a widely accepted idea that the catalyst can accelerate the exother-
mic reaction, resulting in higher temperatures on the burning surface,
thus causing the burning rate to be increased. However, there are
still many debates on which key exothermic reactions have been
catalized or accelerated. There are generally three kinds of theo-
ries for catalytic combustion mechanisms: gas-phase catalytic
mechanisms, heterogeneous interface catalytic mechanisms, and
multi-phase heterogeneous catalytic combustion mechanisms, de-
pending on the action site of the combustion catalyst. A variety of
experimental methods have been used to determine the catalytic
mechanisms of propellant combustion, while the cylindrical multi-
interlayer burner is the most effective one [241,378]. The advantage
of this sandwich burner is that it can enable the addition of cata-
lysts to a different position of the propellant, in order to identify
the action site and mechanism of the specified catalyst. In common
practice, a high-speed camera would be used to observe the flame
structure the SEM to observe the flameout surface, the electron probe
to analyze the elemental composition on the burning surface, and
the MS to test the gaseous products. The following effects of several
important combustion catalyst are described as representatives of
three catalytic combustion mechanisms:

(a) Gas-phase catalytic mechanism

This mechanism describes two facts: (1) the catalyst acceler-
ates the gas-phase decomposition of AP and exothermic reactions
of corresponding gaseous products; (2) the catalyst accelerates the
decomposition of AP particles embedded on the burning surface of
the propellant. This mechanism is based on a steady-state com-
bustion model, which assumes that the heat required for sustaining
the decomposition reaction on the surface is provided by energy
feedback from the gas-phase. Also, the catalyst is able to acceler-
ate the gas-phase exothermic reaction. Several experimental
phenomena have been observed on various types of iron cata-
lysts: (1) the activity of co-precipitated catalyst with AP or coated
on AP is not as good as those mixed in a binder; (2) the oxidizing
agent could not change the catalytic activity; (3) the N—H bond in
AP played an important role during catalytic process. This indi-
cates that the catalyst cannot accelerate heterogeneous reactions
between oxidizer AP beneath the burning surface and the binder.
For instance, during the catalytic combustion of AP, using CuO as
a catalyst, the oxidation of CuO is irreversible. It is believed that the

embedded catalyst particles on the burning surface involved in the
redox cycle during combustion of the propellant, accelerating the
gas-phase exothermic reaction on the surface of the catalyst, and
resulting in a higher heat feedback to the burning surface. However,
many experiments proved that the steady-state combustion model
and corresponding gas-phase catalytic mechanism are not reason-
able assumptions. Many sandwich burner experiments also prove
the catalytic effect is different for the catalysts loaded in the binder
for simulating their contact with the oxidizer.

(b) Heterogeneous interface catalytic mechanism

This mechanism states that the combustion catalyst accelerates
the exothermic reaction on the surface of the oxidants and binders,
or at the interface between these two components, thereby in-
creasing the temperature on the burning surface or gas phase above
burning surface. It was based on the fact that the catalysts cannot
change the decomposition process of the binder, but can accelerate
the heterogeneous exothermic reaction between the oxidizing gaseous
products and binder. In particular, several supporting experimen-
tal findings include: (1) that a copper chromite catalyst is effective
in the catalytic decomposition of AP at low pressures, and en-
hances the interaction between the binder and AP, while having little
effect on the decomposition of the binder; (2) the Fe2O3 can accel-
erate decomposition of AP and promote interaction of its gaseous
products with the binder, but it does not change the decomposi-
tion process of the binders; (3) the catalytic combustion behavior
of AP based on HTPB and carboxyl-terminated polybutadiene (CTPB)
under the same catalyst using cylindrical multi-interlayer burner
are almost the same. These facts suggest that the combustion cat-
alyst could only accelerate the exothermic decomposition reaction
of AP and the interaction of its gaseous products with the binder at
the interface. Therefore, in order to increase the burning rate of AP-
based propellants, the following strategies could be used: (i) increase
the contact interface between the binder and AP by using AP with
as small particle sizes as possible, when the catalysts are incorpo-
rated in the binder; (ii) find a way to coat the catalyst on the AP
particle or form a composite with AP. In order to further confirm
the above theory, Strahle et al. studied the catalytic mechanisms of
copper chromite, Fe2O3, ferrocene, and derivatives on combustion
of AP-based propellant using a cylindrical multi-interlayer burner
coupled with a high-speed camera [307]. The flameout surface was
examined by SEM, and the composition on the burning surface was
analyzed by an electron microprobe. It was shown that: (i) the copper
chromite would effectively induce a deflagration of AP while the
iron compounds were effective catalyst on accelerating the
abovementioned interface reaction; (ii) the catalytic mechanism also
depends on the pressure, e.g., the Fe2O3 can inhibit the deflagration
of AP at lower pressures, while it accelerates the deflagration at higher
pressures; (iii) without the catalysts, the binder melts and can flow
on and cover the surface of AP, preventing its deflagration, because
the catalyst would suppress the flow process; (iv) the combustion
catalyst can significantly change the deflagration surface of AP. These
findings indicate that the inhibitation of melting binder flow by the
combustion catalyst is the key mechanism of burning rate enhance-
ment, but how the catalyst could inhibit the binder flow is still not
so clear [377]. The catalysts can probably enhance the interaction
between the AP particle and the binder, resulting in a higher vis-
cosity of the melted binder.

The abovementioned heterogeneous interface catalytic mecha-
nism is in good agreement with the Proton transfer mechanism for
decomposition of AP [224,225] and corresponding steady-state
condensed-phase combustion model [368–371]. The sandwich
burner experiments proved this theory, which has a certain signif-
icance for the development of the combustion catalyst for AP-
based propellants. However, this theory in its current state is still

128

not perfect, and there are many issues that need to be further clari-
fied, including the unclear reactions between the gaseous products
of AP with the binder, and the inhibition mechanism of the cata-
lyst on flow of the melted binder.

(c) Multi-phase heterogeneous catalytic mechanism

Comparing the abovementioned two mechanisms, the hetero-
geneous interface catalysis theory has been developed faster and
more widely accepted, while the gas-phase catalytic theory has almost
no further improvement, because it is much easier to monitor the
change of the condensed-phase reactants than gas-phase reac-
tions. However, the theory of heterogeneous interface catalysis is
partially deducted from these experiments without sufficient ev-
idence concerning intermediates. In order to establish a more
appropriate theory, Tian and coworkers did large amounts of
experiments and simulation work on catalytic combustion mecha-
nisms of AP-based propellants [379–383]. On the basis of the
abovementioned catalytic mechanisms, they proposed a multi-
phase heterogeneous catalytic mechanism, which is a combination
of the heterogeneous interface mechanism and gas-phase reaction
mechanism. It suggests that the gas, liquid, and solid intermediates
are coexisting in both condensed- and gas-phases. It well ex-
plained the relationship between particle size and the catalytic
efficiency of the catalyst, as well as all of the phenomena observed
in combustion experiments by cylindrical multi-interlayer burner.
The mechanism of this multi-phase mechanism could be sum-
marized as follows: (i) the gaseous products could diffuse in the
condensed-phase, so that the crisscross capillary gas passage could
be observed in condensed-phase, showing gas-, liquid- and solid-
phases in the condensed-phase reaction zone; (ii) a solid catalyst
would act via condensed-phase interactions no matter which kind
of catalytic reaction it involves. The catalytic action can be divided
into physical and chemical catalysis, where the catalytic effect in
the gas-phase is due to acceleration of the gas release from
condensed-phase by the catalyst; (iii) physical catalysis mainly refers
to the direct or indirect influence of catalyst on the melting of the
binder and subsequent covering of the oxidant, which would change
the physical state of the burning surface; (iv) the condensed-
phase catalysis belongs to the multi-phase heterogeneous catalysis,
and the catalytic effects occur mainly through a direct participa-
tion in condensed-phase decomposition reaction, changing their
thermal effect, temperature, and product concentration distribu-
tions. Because the gaseous substance readily diffuses to the surfaces
of the catalyst and the other liquid/solid two-phase components,
the active center of the catalyst can be fully utilized.

4. Summary and future work suggestions

In order to meet the requirements of a variety of solid rocket
motors, often we need to adjust the burning rate of the propel-
lants. Here are some methods commonly used to adjust the burning
rate of the propellant: (i) a reasonable choice of ingredients as well
a size and structure of the propellants; (ii) embedment of long metal
wires or short metal fibers inside the propellant charges; and (iii)
the addition of efficient combustion catalysts, particularly
nanoadditives. Among these three methods, the inclusion of the nano
catalysts is the best choice, which can neither decrease the energy
content of the propellants nor change the production process of pro-
pellants. Currently, as summarized in this review paper, the
nanoadditives that can be considered as combustion catalysts of DB,
MDB and composite propellants can be divided into seven catego-
ries: chromites and chromates, inorganic oxides, organometallic
compounds, ferrocene and derivatives, metal chelates, nanothermites,
and CNMs carried metal oxides. A large amount of results have been
published concerning the preparation of these nanoadditives and

their catalytic effects on the decomposition and combustion of RDX,
HMX, AP, and solid propellants based on them. It has been shown
that, under the effect of nano additives, the decomposition peak tem-
perature could be in most cases reduced, while the heat release could
be increased with decreased activation energy. In most cases, the
decomposition reaction and burning rates were enhanced at either
lower pressure range or higher pressure range depending on the
type of catalysts, with reduced pressure exponents (Table 22).

The burning rates of DB, MDB, and composite propellants can
be significantly increased especially in the lower operation pressures.
The catalytic decomposition mechanisms of RDX and HMX have been
extensively investigated, both theoretically and experimentally. It
has been concluded that the decomposition of HMX and RDX in-
volves grain formation, nucleation and growth of reactive sites, bubble
formation, and nonlinear reactions between the reactant and its non-
volatile secondary products. The main gaseous products of RDX-
based propellants are CH2O, NO2, CO2, NO, CO, and N2O, where N2O
is a unique product from the decomposition of RDX. With the ad-
dition of the nano-sized catalysts (metal oxides, and salts), the ratio
of N2O/HCN, CH2O/NO2, and CH2O/NO will be greatly increased. It
means such catalyst usually favors the scission of C—N bond. However,
the catalytic effect of the nanometal particles is very different from
abovementioned oxides or metal salt catalysts, because the nanometal
particles (Al, B, and Mg) would undergo oxidation reactions with
the oxidizing decomposition products of RDX and HMX.

In the case of AP decomposition, the metal nanopowder con-
tains many defects over crystal lattice, and the metal atoms on the
defects are not saturated and tend to become stable by absorbing
materials with surplus electrons onto its surface. The N atom of AP
contains surplus electrons, so the N—X bond becomes weak and easy
to break owing to the absorbing of the N atom on the surface of Cu
atom. The catalytic effect of metal oxides is different, because there
is no oxidation reactions for these catalysts. During decomposition
of AP, one of the primary products HClO4 from the proton transfer
was desorbed more rapidly than NH3, which causes incomplete ox-
idation of NH3, creating a saturated atmosphere of NH3. However,
the inclusion of the catalyst would consume NH3 by combining to
active metal ions of the catalysts, resulting in faster decomposition
of AP. Importantly, even though the nano catalysts could signifi-
cantly change the decomposition rate and activation energy of RDX,
HMX and AP, they would not change the mechanisms of the rate-
limiting steps for HMX and AP, according to their kinetic compensation
lines. In case of RDX, it decomposes in the liquid state with evap-
oration and the catalysts may change its mechanism due to inhibition
of the evaporation. Moreover, the nanoadditives PCC, nNPF, FHN and
nAl would further decrease the slope of the compensation line for
RDX decomposition due to stronger catalytic effect and energetic
nature of the nNPF, FHN and nAl with exothermic processes during
decomposition. For catalytic decomposition of HMX and AP, the sit-
uation is quite different. They decompose in solid state with
sublimation, and these nanoadditives have little effect on its com-
pensation line, indicating these nanomaterials did not change the
rate limiting decomposition of HMX and AP. However, several
nanomaterials such as nNi and nAl can increase the frequency factor
of AP decomposition, due to stronger catalytic effect and energetic
nature of these nanometals. It is interesting that the ignition kinetic
parameters of AP-based compositions also follow on the compen-
sation line of pure AP, which means that the nanoadditives could
decrease the ignition delay and critical temperature, but they did
not change the initial decomposition rate-limiting step of AP that
leads to runaway chemical reaction/ignition.

The metal oxides, binary metal oxides, inorganic and organic
metal salts, and nanothermites are effective catalysts for DB and MDB
propellants, which can increase the burning rate from 30% to 160%
depending on the pressure, while the pressure exponent is main-
tained less than 0.5. In some cases, the “mesa burning” could be

E1 and E2; the nCu sometimes could decrease Tp of HMX as high as

tions; E3, lower the activation energy for the decomposition reaction; E4, enhanced rates of decomposition reaction, and combustion; E5, increase of the burning rate at

realized with an extended plateau combustion zone by using CNM-
based catalysts. The pure CNMs have promising catalytic effects on
the combustion of DB and MDB propellants, but the composite cata-
lysts carried by CNMs are not so good with relatively low catalytic
efficiency. In the case of AP-based propellants, the best and most
widely used nano catalysts are nFe2O3, nTiO2, nCuO, and Cu—Cr—O
nanocomposites. The burning rate after catalytic actions is some-
times much higher than those of DB and MDB propellants, but the
AP-based propellants have much higher pressure exponent, which
is usually in the range of 0.3–0.6. It also seems that all mentioned
catalysts, in general, have a much stronger effect on DB and MDB
propellants, where there are many additives that can change their
burning rate by up to more than 200%.

One more attention should be paid to the combustion of pro-
pellants containing nano metal particles, which is not included in
this review paper due to limited space for a large amount of re-
search data. One has to note that the combustion of nano metals

is more complicated than the catalytic effects on decomposition of
energetic components stated in Sections 2.1–2.3. Currently, most
of the investigations have been done on combustion of nAl par-
ticles, where, as repeated many times in above text for catalytic
combustion of solid propellants, the aggregation/agglomeration phe-
nomena played a key role in their catalytic behavior [384]. This
phenomenon has been observed near the burning surface appear
quite different for nAl formulations compared with micro-sized Al
particle (mAl) formulations. A comparison between the different
transformations of mAl and nAl powders during the combustion
process is shown in Fig. 42. With respect to nAl, the propellants filled
with nAl aggregates form limited coralline structure on the burning
surface before leaving it, whereas mAl generates droplets that may
reach up to several hundred micrometers before leaving the surface
[385,386]. For uncoated nAl burning under subatmospheric pressure,
about 80% γ-Al2O3 and δ-Al2O3 were recovered, while up to 10% was
unburned Al and the remaining condensed combustion products

It suggested that the nano metals have both advantages and
disadvantages.

Even though so much progress has been made, there are still
many challenges and much work left to be done in this research
field. First of all, the decomposition kinetics and physical models
of many nanoadditives are not available in the literature. These pa-
rameters are very important for safety considerations of the final
propellants and quantitative evaluation of their catalytic activity.
The quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics methods may be
used for calculations of catalytic decomposition mechanisms of en-
ergetic compounds and composites. The current high technology
development on computer science enables us to perform large-
scale calculations and simulations for multi-component energetic
systems including high explosives and propellants. These theoret-
ical results could be compared with the experimental data in the
literature. This research area will play an increasingly important role
in the design and application of new energetic materials, and provide
more effective supports for the practical application of the newly-
established theories and application of new energetic materials.
Regarding combustion, the reactive forcefield molecular dynamic
(ReaxFF) simulation enables us to monitor the chemical changes
under extreme conditions for any kinds of energetic systems, which
might be one of our future research topic for catalytic combustion
behavior under high pressure conditions.
