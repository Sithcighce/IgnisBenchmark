Atomization and evaporation processes have extensively existed in a variety of scientific and engineer-
ing applications, such as, rain formation, spray cooling, and spray combustion in propulsion devices. In
spray combustion, atomization and evaporation processes govern the resultant liquid droplet characteris-
tics, which strongly affect the combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. However, atomization and
evaporation are very complicated processes that involve convoluted interfaces as well as the breakup and
coalescence of liquid masses, together with mass and heat transfers on the interface. Deep insights into
atomization and evaporation put a significant challenge to the measuring techniques due to the harsh
conditions and multi-scale nature of the problem within the apparatus. With the developments of com-
putational algorithm and computer capacity, detailed numerical simulation of the atomization and evap-
oration processes has been a promising tool to explore the underlying physics. Level set method is such
an interface capturing method, and tremendous progresses have been made for detailed numerical sim-
ulation of atomization and evaporation over the past few decades. In this article, we attempt to review
the recent progresses in the development of the level set method and its applications to atomization
and evaporation. Firstly, the fundamentals of the level set method are introduced and recent advances
in improving the mass conservation are emphasized. Secondly, numerical issues for detailed numerical
simulation of atomization and evaporation are summarized and the strategies for treating them are high-
lighted. We then review the state-of-the-art progresses in detailed numerical simulation of atomization
and evaporation with the level set method. The challenges and future prospects are summarized in the
end.

1. Introduction

Gas-liquid two-phase flows with evaporation have extensively
existed in a variety of scientific and engineering applications, such
as spray cooling [1,2] , spray combustion [3,4] and so on. Among
these applications, spray combustion has attracted a lot of atten-
tion due to its paramount importance in power generation. Spray
combustion  can  be  divided  into  several  sub-processes,  such  as,
fuel injection, atomization, droplet dispersion, evaporation, fuel-air
mixing, and combustion, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Liquid fuel is firstly
injected from the nozzle in the form of bulk liquid to the com-
bustion chamber and then is atomized into large numbers of fine
droplets. The atomization process can further be divided into pri-
mary atomization and secondary atomization. The primary atom-
ization is defined as the process from bulk liquid to filaments and
droplets, and the secondary atomization is defined as the process
from  the  filaments  and  droplets  to  much  smaller  droplets.  After
evaporation of droplets, ignition and combustion occur to provide
power for the system.

To achieve optimized performance of combustion as well as low
pollution emission, atomization and evaporation should be well-
understood. However, atomization and evaporation are very com-
plex  processes  that  involve  multi-scale  convoluted  interfaces  as
well as breakup and coalescence of liquid masses [5] , together with
heat and mass transfers on the phase interfaces. Deep insights into
atomization and evaporation put a significant challenge to diagnos-
tic technologies due to the harsh conditions and multi-scale nature
of the problem within the apparatus. Taking the atomization pro-
cess as an example, it is usually a problem in hydrodynamic insta-
bility and transitional turbulence, with typical multi-scale charac-
teristics. The length scale could range from the size of the flow to
the size of the smallest droplets. With the developments of compu-
tational algorithm and computer capacity, computational fluid dy-
namics (CFD) has been demonstrated to be an efficient tool to ex-
plore the underlying physics of atomization and evaporation. The
goal of the present review is to summarize the recent progress in
CFD of atomization and evaporation with the level set method.

Essentially,  there are three  kinds of  approaches in the  classi-
cal CFD of atomization and evaporation in spray combustion, i.e .
Reynolds  averaged  Navier–Stokes  (RANS),  large  eddy  simulation
(LES),  and  direct  numerical  simulation  (DNS).  It  has  been  well-
known that RANS is able to get only the time-averaged informa-
tion with closure models, but the computational cost is the low-
est. These features are attractive to industrial engineers. LES of at-
omization with sub-grid models has appeared in the recent years
[6-10] . The principal idea of LES is to reduce computational cost
by spatial filtering of the governing equations and introducing the

turbulent viscosity. However, there is an inherent weakness of LES
of atomization, for instance, the contrary of underlying critical as-
sumption of turbulent viscosity and the physical process of atom-
ization. In most practices of LES, the value of the turbulent viscos-
ity is positive by a diffusive mechanism, meaning energy transfer
from resolved scales to the subgrid scales [11] . But in reality, the
energy transfer is bi-directional [12] . In particular, Elghobashi and
Truesdell  [13,14]  found  the  energy  backscatter  in  particle-laden
flows. Regarding DNS, all scales in the system should be resolved
without closure models, particularly the Kolmogorov scale η in the
gas and liquid phases, and the smallest scale of droplet need to
be resolved. For the Kolmogorov scale, the spatial resolution crite-
rion k max η ≥ 1.5 [15] should be satisfied, in which k max is the max-
imum wavenumber. For the smallest scale of droplet, at least four
to eight grid points are required to obtain a physically reasonable
droplet. All these requirements lead to so huge computational de-
mand for DNS of atomization and evaporation that usually only the
gas-phase is fully solved while the liquid phase is modeled using
atomization and evaporation models in the literature. In previous
CFD simulations of spray combustion, atomized droplets or atom-
ization models were commonly used [3,4,16] . However, it has been
demonstrated that spray combustion characteristics can be signif-
icantly influenced by the atomization conditions [17,18] . Further-
more, though a variety of evaporation models exist, most of them
are based on empirical correlations for spherical droplets [19] . To
eliminate possible errors from traditional atomization and evapo-
ration models so as to improve CFD of spray combustion, there is
an urgent need to develop advanced numerical methods for better
understanding and characterizing atomization and evaporation.

To this end, two-phase DNS with fully-resolved interface meth-
ods  has  drawn  a  lot  of  attention  in  the  recent  years.  In  princi-
ple, this kind of DNS can resolve all scales involved in the system.
However,  the  smallest  droplet  size  (the  Hinze  length  scale)  has
not always been well resolved in the literature, and this method
is thus usually called as detailed numerical simulation or under-
resolved DNS [12] . Crucial to detailed numerical simulation of at-
omization  and  evaporation  is  the  way  to  capture  or  track  the
gas-liquid interface. Basically, interface capturing denotes the Eu-
lerian description of the interface, whereas interface tracking de-
notes the Lagrangian description of the interface. During the last
three  decades,  three  major  interface  capturing/tracking  methods,
namely,  the  front  tracking  method  [20,21] ,  the  volume-of-fluid
(VOF) method [22,23] , and the level set method [24-26] have been
developed.  As  illustrated  in  Fig.  2 ,  the  front  tracking  method  is
based  on  tracking  massless  particles  to  represent  the  gas-liquid
interface. While the VOF method utilizes the liquid volume frac-
tion to represent the interface. The volume fraction φ

[27-29] , the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method [30,31] and
the phase field method [32,33] . The advantage and disadvantage
of these interface-resolved numerical methods are summarised in
Table S1. An excellent review of different interface-capturing meth-
ods can also be found in [34] .

Among the interface-capturing methods, the VOF method and
the level set method are the most popular methods. Some quali-
tative and quantitative comparisions between them have been re-
ported.  Mirjalili  et  al.  [34]  gave  a  comprehensive but  qualitative
comparison between the VOF method and the level set method. It

was shown that the level set method has the advantages of eco-
nomical cost and simplicity of computing normal and curvature,
while  the  VOF  method  has  the  advantage  of  mass  conservation.
Quantitatively, Albadawi et al. [35,36] compared the VOF method
and the level set method by simulating the bubble growth and de-
tachment at low Capillary and Bond numbers. The level set method
had been shown to predict the bubble detachment volume with
errors lower than 2%, better than the VOF method. Denner et al.
[37]  found  that  the  level  set  method  performs  better  for  quasi-
stationary  flows  where  surface  tension  dominates,  but  it  suffers
from numerical diffusion in simulation of rising bubble. Bilger et al.
[38] performed a direct and quantitative comparison of the VOF
method and the level set method in the same code, and found that
the VOF method shows smaller errors of spurious currents and the
level set method shows a greater sensitivity to operating parame-

ters for the low Capillary number. For the high Capillary number,
the  level  set  method  exhibits  a  slightly  better  ability  to  capture
droplet pinch-off. These studies demonstrate that the VOF method
and the level set method each has its unique advantage in certain
regime. Due to its simplicity, the level set method has been paid
numerous attention and significant progresses on atomization and
evaporation have been achieved in the recent years [39,42] .

The main objective of this review is to highlight the fundamen-
tal developments of the level set method, identify some numerical
challenges and recent progresses, and provide future outlooks from
the perspectives of detailed numerical simulation of atomization
and evaporation. The feature of this review is that atomization and
evaporation are formulated together in the framework of the level
set method, and relevant issues and advances are comprehensively
summarized.  Although  some  relevant reviews [39-42] have been
published, most of them focus on either the level set method itself
or atomization models, which distinguishes them from the present
review. In Section 2 , we will introduce the basic level set formula-
tion and the strategies to improve mass conservation, which is of
significant importance for simulations of atomization and evapo-
ration. In Section 3 , numerical issues and strategies for simulating
atomization with evaporation will be discussed.  This is followed
by the recent state-of-the-art progresses achieved by the level set
method, including the primary atomization, the secondary atom-
ization, the atomization with turbulence, and the evaporation in

Section 4 . Finally, the challenges and future prospects in simulating
atomization and evaporation processes with the level set method
will be outlined.

2. Level set method

2.1. Basic level set formulation

Description of the interface evolution is a fundamental compo-
nent of gas-liquid flows. The level set method proposed by Osher
and Sethian [26] is an efficient way to represent the interface as
the level set of a higher dimensional function. It has evolved from
a mathematical formulation to a versatile and powerful method-
ology for interface capturing [39-42] . The main advantage of this
implicit representation of a moving interface is its ability to natu-
rally handle topology changes, as shown in Fig. 3 . The basic level
set formulation is introduced as follows.

The level set method represents the interface, (cid:12), as the zero-
contour of a higher dimensional function, φ, called the level set
function, which is usually defined as the signed distance function
to (cid:12):

existing level set method. Firstly, the discretization of the level set
equation may lead to significant numerical dissipation that usually
manifests itself as a loss of mass in the areas of high curvature or
other under-resolved regions [39] . Secondly, in the re-initialization
process, the zero level set can be altered owing to numerical arti-
facts, which leads to additional mass loss. Numerous attempts have
been made to improve the mass conservation property of the basic
level set method, which can be classified into seven categories as
follows.

2.2.1. Discretization of the level set equation

As one part of the numerical error comes from the discretiza-
tion  of  the  level  set  equation,  it  is  straightforward  to  improve
the  accuracy  by  increasing  the  order  of  discretization  schemes.
Since  the  level  set  transport  equation  is  a  hyperbolic  equation

tal  variation  diminishing  (TVD)  method,  etc.  Nourgaliev  et  al.
[45] used 5th-order linear WENO scheme to discretize the level set
equation and pointed out that mass losses are reduced compared
to lower order scheme. Salih et al. [46] examined the first-order
upwind scheme, the MacCormack method, the second-order ENO
scheme and the fifth-order WENO scheme, and demonstrated that
the level set method performs better when high-order schemes are
used.

Recently, other preserving schemes have been developed for the
level set formulation. Sheu et al. [47,48] proposed a dispersion re-
lation preserving advection scheme [47] . This scheme maintains a
sharp  shape  of  the  level  set  profile  to  promote  good  mass  con-
servation, and excellent agreement with experimental data can be
achieved. Another popular numerical scheme is the Discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) method. The DG method was originally proposed by
Reed and Hill [49] and has been used wildly in the discretization
of the level set equation because it is a compact scheme with ar-
bitrary high-order accuracy without the necessity of a large stencil
[50-53] . The main idea of the DG method is to represent a function
using  a  linear  combination  of  P  basis  functions  within  each  cell
to  create  a  piecewise  polynomial  representation  of  the  function.
The  semi-Lagrangian  approach  has  also  been  developed  for  the
discretization of the level set function by using an efficient, first-
order accurate semi-Lagrangian advection scheme in [54,55] or a
high-order scheme in [56] . However, the semi-Lagrangian advec-
tion scheme does not have the inherent conservation property, and

Since the level set function does not retain its signed distance
function property as it evolves in time as illustrated in Fig. 4 , Suss-
man et al. [43] introduced the re-initialization equation
φτ + sgn ( φ0 )( | ∇φ| − 1) = 0
to transform a level set function φ
0 into the signed distance func-
tion φ. Here, sgn is a smoothed-out signum function and τ repre-
sents a fictitious time that controls the width of the band around
the zero-level set where φ will be sign-distanced.

2.2. Issues of and strategies to improve the basic level set method

Despite  of  inherent  advantages,  the  level  set  method  suffers
from unphysical loss of the fluid mass as time evolves, which is
a crucial issue to detailed numerical simulation of atomization and
evaporation. There are two main reasons for the mass loss in the

a discrete set of particles arriving at the grid points [57] or the
particle on the interface [54] are usually used to conserve the mass
conservation property.

Another high-order scheme is the so-called gradient-augmented
level  set  (GALS)  method.  It  is  optimally  local  and  the  sub-grid
structure is represented to high-accuracy since the level set func-
tion and its gradient are addressed within each cell. Defining the

where  ∇
u  is  the  velocity  deformation  matrix.  Numerical  stud-
ies  showed  that  the  GALS  method  conserves  mass  much  better
than the standard level set method [58,59] . Based on the gradient
form of the advection equation, Kohno and Nave [60] further pre-
sented a novel numerical method for resolving the level set func-
tion by using the hierarchical-gradient truncation and remapping
technique.

(5)

Although numerous effort s have been made to improve the dis-
cretization of the level set equation, the mass conservation is still
an issue for simulations of  certain type of shearing and vortical
velocity fields even by using the above-mentioned high-order and
preserving schemes.

2.2.2. Extension velocity to transport level set equation

Instead of using high-order discretization of the level set equa-
tion,  Adalsteinsson  and  Sethian  [61]  proposed  that  the  level  set
equation can be transported by an extension velocity rather than
the fluid velocity. This idea was founded on the fact that the gra-
dient  of  the  level  set  function  grows  very  rapidly  with  time  in
shearing  velocity  fields.  To  maintain  a  signed  distance  function,
the velocity field can be specially constructed so that | ∇φ| = 1 and
∇ F ext · ∇ φ = 0 are satisfied, where F ext is the extension velocity. It
can be more precise by rewriting the level set transport equation
as
φt + F ext | ∇φ| = 0

(6)

Here the extension velocity F ext is a certain velocity field which,
at the zero level set, equals the propagation speed of the interface
F , as shown in Fig. 5 . The Fast Marching Method (FMM) [61] is an
efficient  method  to  construct  the  extension  velocity  field,  which
advances the solution from the interface in an upwind fashion.

It should be noted that this extension velocity method theoret-
ically preserves the signed distance function without the need of
re-initialization.  However,  the  original  extension  velocity  is  only
first-order approximation of the velocity field near the interface,
and it may lead to unexpected numerical artifacts due to the strict

requirement of the local solutions for the flow near the interface
[53] .

Similar to the extension velocity, Ovsyannikov et al. [62] pro-
posed to maintain the signed distance function by introducing a
source term directly into the level set equation, which has been
recently extended to higher-order accuracy  [63] . In this method,
the level set transport equation is rewritten as
∂φ
∂t
where the coefficient A (
does  not  depend  on  φ(

The Taylor’s expansion of A (

(9)

Application of this method simplifies the realization of the level
set method in comparison with the extension velocity method, but
it requires the return to the re-initialization process. Nevertheless,
the number of re-initializations can be substantially reduced. Un-
fortunately, this method has not yet been evaluated in more com-
plex configurations.

2.2.3. Hyperbolic tangent level set method

The level set function is not necessary the signed distance func-
tion.  When  choosing  a  suitable  level  set  function,  three  criteria
should be satisfied: conservative, no spurious oscillations and con-
stant  thickness  of  the  interface.  Instead  of  the  signed  distance
function, Olsson et al. [64,65] proposed to use the hyperbolic tan-
gent function as the level set function. It is of second-order accu-
racy and satisfactory of mass conservation in the region bounded
by the interface. The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as

where ε is a parameter to control the thickness of the profile. This
formulation constructs the correlation between the level set func-
tion and the hyperbolic tangent function. Rather than defining the
interface by the iso-surface φ = 0, it is now defined by the location

This re-initialization equation is advanced in pseudo-time τ . It
consists of a compression term on the left hand side that aims at
sharpening the interface profile, and a diffusion term on the right
hand side that ensures the profile to remain characteristic thick-
ness ε. Through this hyperbolic tangent level set method, the mass
loss can be considerably reduced [66-69] .

However, this method also reduces the sharpness of the level
set method in spite of its roughly conservative property. It can lead
to small pieces of fluid called flotsam and jetsam non-physically
breaking off from the interface in under-resolved regions and mov-
ing around with erroneous velocity, like the VOF method to some
extent [68] .

2.2.4. Interface refined level set method

As the level set function only needs to be resolved near the in-
terface,  the  computational  cost  can  be  largely  reduced  by  using
the narrow band method [68] . But it still suffers from mass loss
in the under-resolved regions. Several spatially adaptive methods
have been developed to efficiently resolve the interface, including
the  adaptive  level  set  approach  [70,71] ,  the  octree  based  meth-
ods [39] , the structured adaptive mesh refinement [45] , the spec-
trally refined interface approach [57] and the refined level set grid
(RLSG) method [72] . Although these variants of level set method
are different in form and implementation, they all have the same
essence to increase the sub-cell resolution near the interface. Con-
sequently, the RLSG method is selected as a typical technique to be
introduced here. Other spatially adaptive variants could be found
in the previous reviews of Losasso et al. [39] and Gibou et al. [40] ,
and the references therein.

The RLSG method is proposed by Herrmann [72] . The key idea
of the RLSG method is to solve all level set method related equa-
tions on an additional, separate, equidistant, Cartesian grid, termed
G-grid. Since both grids, the G-grid and the flow solver grid are
separate,  the  G-grid  can  be  independently  refined  to  ensure  a
grid converged interface representation. On the first level, the flow
solver grid is overlaid by an equidistant Cartesian super-grid in-
cluding computational domain where the interface might exist, as
shown in Fig. 7 . Only those cells containing part of the interface
or  are  within  a  predefined  distance  from  the  interface  are  acti-
vated. On the second level, each active block contains an equidis-
tant Cartesian grid of grid cell size h
G . Again, only those cells con-
taining part of the interface or are within a predefined distance

from the interface are activated. This approach effectively reduces
the  number  of  cells  and  allows  for  high  resolution  of  the  inter-
face, as only small fraction of cells that are located in a small band
around the interface are active and stored. For example, consider-
ing a super-grid of size 128 3 and a local block size of 32 3 , this ap-
proach yields a theoretical maximum resolution of about 70 billion
cells.

Such interface refined level set methods are expected to be not
only an excellent way to reduce the mass loss, but also a promis-
ing  tool  for  multi-scale  simulations  of  atomization  and  evapora-
tion. However, challenges arise during the procedure of coupling
the level set method with the hierarchical data structure. Further-
more,  the  parallel  load  balancing  is  of  importance  owing  to  the
non-uniform grid population.

2.2.5. Improvement of the re-initialization process

The re-initialization is required in order to maintain the level
set  function  as  a  signed  distance  function.  Specifically,  the  re-
initialization process should modify the level set function so that
| ∇φ| = 1  is  satisfied  and  keep  the  zero  iso-surface  φ
0  invariant.
There are two major numerical approaches for the re-initialization
process, namely, the partial differential equation (PDE) based ap-
proach and the FMM based approach. For each approach, improve-
ments have been made in the literature.

The  PDE  based  re-initialization  procedure  was  originally  pro-
0 ,
0 )(1 − | ∇φ|) to steady state. The signum function sgn is
0  unchanged on the interface. For numerical pur-

posed by Sussman et al. [43] by solving the equation φτ = L ( φ
φ) = sgn ( φ
used to keep φ
pose, it is useful to smooth the sign function as

S ε ( φ0 ) =

φ0 (cid:7)
.
0 + ε 2
φ2

(12)

At steady state, φ will converge to | ∇φ| = 1. A nice feature of
this formulation is that the re-initialization procedure completely
avoids detecting the interface, which is efficient for implementa-
tion.

In complex simulations of, for example, atomization and evapo-
ration where the interface deforms frequently and severely, this re-
initialization process, however, may cause unphysically mass loss
at each time step due to numerical diffusion. To conserve the vol-
ume  of  the  domain  bounded by  the  interface,  Sussman  and Co-
authors [73,74] further proposed a constraint by requiring

computational cost. For summary, the PDE based re-initialization
equations used in the literature are listed in Table S2.

The  discretization  scheme  for  the  above  re-initializations  is
found  to  be  important  to  the  mass  conservation  [75] .  Hart-
mann et al. [76] proposed two formulations of the re-initialization
scheme.  One  uses  the  least-squares  method  to  explicitly  mini-
mize  the  displacement  of  the  zero  level  set  and  the  other  is
derived  by  systematically  minimizing  the  number  of  constraints
imposed  on  the  re-initialization  scheme.  Furthermore,  Hartmann
et al. [77] proposed a new constrained re-initialization equation in-
corporating a forcing term which can be written as
φτ + sign ( φ0 ) ( | ∇φ| − 1 ) = α f
(17)
where α is a weighting factor set α = 0.5 and f is the forcing term.
Indeed, this formulation combines the simplicity and generality of
the original re-initialization equation and the accuracy of the con-
strained re-initialization scheme.

Another  different  re-initialization  equation  is  proposed  by
Chang et al. [78] , who performed the re-initialization procedure by
solving a perturbed Hamilton-Jacobi equation
∂φ
∂τ

to a steady state, where A
0  denotes the total mass at the initial
condition, A ( t ) denotes the total mass at time t, P is a positive con-
stant. This formulation is based on the observation that numeri-
cal diffusion introduces a normal motion proportional to the local
0 − A ( t )), is of order
curvature [79] . The difference in the mass, ( A
O ( (cid:20)x 2 ) in the smooth region and it does not change the overall
accuracy of the method.

For  the  hyperbolic  tangent  level  set  method,  the  correspond-
ing re-initialization equation ( Eq. (11) ) is solved in various cases
[64,65,68] . To some extent, this re-initialization equation is simi-
lar to the conservative equation in phase field method [80] . Mc-
Caslin  and  Desjardins  [81]  further  improved  the  re-initialization
equation to account for a significant amount of spatial variability
in  the  level  set  transport.  This  local  re-initialization  is  based  on
the estimation of local flow deformation and numerical diffusion.
A spatially and temporally varying factor is introduced into the re-
initialization equation to yield

The FMM based re-initialization procedure was first proposed
by Sethian [44] . In this framework, the FMM is efficiently used to
solve the Eikonal equation for re-initialization | ∇φ| = 1 by ordered
sweeping in the direction of normal characteristics. Specifically, re-
initialization of the signed distance function amounts to marching
the front from the interface to the rest of the computational do-
main, as illustrated in Fig. 8 . Crucial to the FMM process are the
three lists A, C, and F, distinguishing each computational cell as
“accepted”, “close”, and “far”, respectively. The upwind finite dif-
ference scheme is used to compute φ
i,j,k within each close cell in
list C by solving the equation

Once φ has been computed in all close cells, it is added to list A
and any of its adjacent far neighbors are removed from list F and
added to list C. The process of solving Eq. (21) is repeated and the
entire procedure is performed separately for regions correspond-
ing to φ < 0 and φ ≥ 0. This method benefits the re-initialization
procedure in terms of computational cost, and can be straightfor-
wardly extended to achieve higher-order accuracy [44,57,68] .

In  addition,  some  other  re-initialization  methods  have  also
been  proposed  recently  in  the  literature,  such  as  the  geometric
mass-preserving  re-distancing  scheme  [82]  and  the  volume  re-
initialization scheme including the effect of local curvature [83] .

2.2.6. Hybrid method

The level set method has also been coupled with other tech-
niques to reduce the mass loss. Sussman et al. [84,85] firstly pro-
posed a coupled level set/volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method, which
takes  advantages  of  the  mass  conservation  property  of  the  VOF
method.  In  the  CLSVOF  method,  after  the  advection  step  of  the
level set scalar and volume fraction scalar, the coupling between
the  two  scalars  occurs  twice.  The  first  coupling  happens  when
the  interface  is  reconstructed  with  the  interface  normal  vector
→
n = ∇φ. The second coupling occurs when
directly computed as
φ is  reinitialized  to  the  signed  distance  from  the  reconstructed
interface.  This  re-initialization  to  the  signed  distance  is  actually
quite  complicated  since  it  is  necessary  to  consider  portions  of
the  cell  boundary  in  order  to  keep  the  level  set  scalar  continu-
ous,  as  shown  in  Fig.  9 .  As  a  consequence,  many  improvements
on  the  CLSVOF  method  [86-91]  have  been  made  and  other  ver-
sions such as, the coupled volume-of-fluid and level set method
[92] ,  the  conservation  correction  equation  method  [93] ,  and  the
level  set-volume  constraint  method  [94]  have  been  developed.
But still, these coupled level set methods suffer from complexity

in implementation, including the advection of both the level set
function  and  the  volume  fraction,  the  piecewise  linear  interface
construction, and the subsequent reconstruction of level set scalar
based on this piecewise linear interface as well as the coupling be-
tween scalars.

To  reduce  the  complexity  in  implementation,  Pijl  et  al.
[95,96] proposed a coupled mass-conserving method, in which the
level set and the volume fraction were used without the compli-
cated  interface  constructions.  This  method  is  based  on  the  level
set method, using a VOF function to conserve mass. Crucial to this
method is the relationship between the level set function φ and
the volume of fluid function φ
vol
is first computed from the level set function φ, and then advected
conservatively. The level set function φ then can be easily updated
by using the volume of fluid function φ
vol through a iteration pro-
cedure. This method has been improved by Luo et al. [97] . They
further improved the mass conservation of the liquid phase by cor-
recting the volume fraction based on the local curvature on the
interface. This mass remedy procedure includes three steps as fol-
lows:

A similar method based on the sigmoid function can be found

in Chai et al. [98] .

Additionally, the particle level set method has been developed
in order to combine the accuracy of the Lagrangian front tracking
with simplicity and the efficiency of the level set method. In this
method,  the  Lagrangian  marker  particles  are  passively  advected
with flow and are used to rebuild the level set function in under-
resolved regions [99] . This is usually the case for flows undergoing
stretching and tearing. Other improvements on the particle level
set method can be found in [54,100-102] . Initially, the particles are
set within a band across the interface. Each particle stores its po-
sition and radius that are used to perform the error correction to
the level set. The particle radius can be expressed as,

r max = 0.5max ( (cid:20)x , (cid:20)y , (cid:20)z ). Whenever a particle escapes from the
interface by more than its radius, it will be used to perform the
error correction on the interface. The particle predicted level set
value for each corner of the cell containing the escaped particle is
defined as

2.2.7. Variational level set method

In the basic level set formulation, the re-initialization process is
obviously a disagreement between the theory and its implemen-
tation [103] , and many developed re-initialization processes have
undesirable side effects on the interface [104] . As a result, some ef-
forts to attempt the level set method without re-initialization pro-
cess have been made, such as the variational formulation [105,106] ,
the modified level set equation [63] , and the stabilized variational
method [107] .

In these methods, the level set function is defined on a domain,

and the energy function is defined as

(cid:8)

(cid:17)( φ) = α

I ( | ∇φ| ) dx

(cid:16)

(25)

where α is a constant and I is an energy density function. The min-
imization of the energy (cid:17)( φ) is to regulate the level set function
as a signed distance function. Considering that the signed distance
function satisfies the Eikonal equation | ∇φ| = 1, one can simply de-
fine the energy density function as

I ( | ∇φ| ) =

2
( | ∇φ| − 1 )

1
2

(26)

Mathematically,  a  standard  method  to  minimize  the  energy
functional (cid:17)( φ) is to find the steady-state solution to the gradi-
ent flow equation
∂(cid:17)
∂φ
∂φ
∂t
where ∂ (cid:17)/ ∂ φ is the Gâteaux derivative of the function (cid:17)( φ).

By  calculating  the  variations  and  recalling  the  motion  of  the
level set function, the evolution equation of the level set function
can be rewritten as
∂φ
∂t
in  which  the  factor  1 − 1/| ∇φ|  can  be  regarded  as  the  diffusion
rate. If | ∇φ| > 1, the diffusive rate is positive and the diffusion is
forward to decrease | ∇ φ|; If | ∇ φ| < 1, the diffusive rate is negative
and the diffusion is backward to increase | ∇φ|. It should be noted
that this diffusion has an undesirable side effect on the evolution
of the level set function when | ∇φ| is close to zero leading to an
unbounded diffusion rate. This infinite diffusion rate will contam-
inate the accurate location of the zero level set, especially for the
narrow-band level set function, which has been improved in [108] .
It  should  be  summarized  here  that  the  above  seven types  of
strategies are all aiming at improving the mass-conservative prop-
erty of the basic level set formulation. The former four categories
are related to the first reason of mass loss while the others are
related  to  the  second  reason.  In  particular,  the  former  four  cat-
egories  focus  on  numerical  measures,  including  using  the  high-
order  schemes,  the  extension  velocity,  the  better  level  set  func-
tion,  and  the  locally  refined  grid,  to  improve  the  discretization,
whereas the others consider variant level set method with alter-
native re-initialization or even without re-initialization process. It
is  expected  that  the  interface  refined  level  set  method  coupling
with the VOF method is the most attracting and promising tool
for  simulations  of  atomization  and  evaporation.  In  this  kind  of
coupled methods, however, the reconstruction procedures between
the signed distance function and volume fraction are expected to
induce errors on interface location that can deteriorate the curva-
ture accuracy, leading to stability issues in configurations that in-
volve high capillary numbers [68,109] . Indeed, if the interface nor-
mal and the curvature of Eq. (2) are calculated from a smoothed
version of the sharp volume fraction rather than the signed dis-
tance function, spurious oscillations occur as reported in [68] . For
years, this has been a strong advantage for the level set method
since even methods with weak mass conservation properties such
as the original formulation of Sussman et al. [43] can exhibit very
good  stability  and  accuracy  properties  in  regard  to  the  capillary
force. As a result, there is currently not a general agreement on
addressing the well-known mass conservation issue, and more ef-
forts need to be made along this line.

3. Level set method for atomization with evaporation

With the development of computational capacity, the level set
method  has  been  widely  used  to  directly  simulate  the  atom-
ization process [68,110,111] . In 2008, Gorokhovski and Herrmann
[12]  have outlined some severe  numerical challenges that occur
in  interface-resolved  modelling  of  primary  atomization,  and  re-
lated numerical strategies to address them. The numerical issues
are briefly summarized here as: length and time scales, interface
topology  changes,  material  property  discontinuities,  surface  ten-
sion treatments and inherent 3D configurations. Some state-of-the-
art strategies for surface tension treatment [112] and large density
ratio  treatment  [113]  have  been  accessable,  we  will  not  go  into
details  here.  In  realistic  spray  combustion  applications,  however,
the liquid evaporates simultaneously with the atomization process,
which means the interaction between the atomization and evapo-
ration should be considered for a better understanding of the phys-
ical  processes.  Consequently,  challenges  increase  in  detailed  nu-
merical simulations due to the heat and mass transfer as well as
the generated Stefan flow nearthe interface. We will address these
challenges in the context of the level set method in the present
review.

3.1. Governing equations

For  the  Navier–Stokes  equations  of  two-phase  flows  that  in-
volve variable discontinuities on the interface, there are three dif-
ferent formulations, namely the “Whole-Domain Formulation”, the
“Whole-Domain Conservation Law Form” and the “Jump Condition
Form” [114] . The former two forms express the discontinuities as
singular source terms in the governing equations by introducing a
Dirac distribution at the interface, whereas the third form sepa-
rately solves the equations and imposes an additional jump con-
dition  on  the  interface  to  respect  the  discontinuities.  These  for-
mulations are theoretically equivalent [115,116] . However, a main
difficulty arises in accurately discretizing the singular source terms
[117,118]  for  the former two forms.  In  contrast,  the  “Jump  Con-
dition  Formulation” allows  a  sharper  representation  of  the  dis-
continuity  terms  [119] .  As  the  evaporation  rate  is  usually  calcu-
lated from the jump conditions in the regions just adjacent to the
interfaces,  the  governing  equations  for  incompressible  evaporat-
ing gas-liquid flows are expressed in the “Jump Condition Form”
as

To fully respect the mass conservation, momentum conserva-
tion and energy conservation across the interface, additional jump
conditions (or boundary conditions) should be provided on the in-
terface. However, while benifiting much from the implicite defini-
tion of the convoluted interface, the level set method meets diffi-
culties in imposing these jump conditions. In particular, they are
not straightforwardly imposed on the interface but are in the adja-
cent cells instead [120] . As a result, the ghost fluid method (GFM)
[121] has been incorporated, and the following sections discuss the
specific numerical issues and treatments.

3.2. Numerical issues and treatments of atomization with evaporation

Except  for  those  typical  challenges  addressed  previously  by
Gorokhovski and Herrmann [12] , the following issues are specif-
ically  appeared  for  evaporation  simulations:  (1)  The  evaporation
process adds new jump conditions across the interface to the gov-
erning equations and further increases the complexity of system.
(2) Unrealistic mass predictions may easily take place in the high
density ratio case if the velocity field extension of the liquid phase
cannot respect the divergence-free condition in the whole domain.
(3) The general and effective method to determine the evaporation
rate in different situations still remains the way ahead. These nu-
merical issues and the state-of-the-art treatments for them will be
presented as follows.

3.2.1. Interface jump conditions and their treatments

As  aforementioned,  the  level  set  method  essentially  allows  a
sharp but implicite presentation of the interface. Therefore, impos-
ing the jump conditions need careful treatments. The jump con-
ditions across the interface can be classified into three categories:
the  material  property  jump  condition,  the  zero-order  jump  con-
dition, and the first-order jump condition. For convenience, three
subscripts l, g and (cid:12) are difined here to respectively indicate the
liquid phase, the gas phase and the interface. A jump operator [ ·]
across the interface (cid:12) is also defined:
[ A ] (cid:12) = A

(33)

l − A g

The  material  jump  condition  denotes  the  jumps  of  physical
properties  including  the  density ρ,  the  dynamic  viscosity  μ,  the
thermal conductivity λ and the specific heat C p . When simulating
incompressible two-phase flows, these physical properties are usu-
ally assumed to be constant in each phase, but jump on the gas-
l − λg ,
l − ρg , [ μ] (cid:12) = μ
liquid interface as: [ ρ] (cid:12) = ρ
[ C p ] (cid:12) = C
pl − C pg . Note that the latter two terms are newly intro-
duced by the energy and species equations.

l − μg , [ λ] (cid:12) = λ

The zero-order jump condition includes the jumps of the ve-
locity and the pressure. Due to the Stefan flow near the interface,
the velocity is no longer continuous across the interface. Apply-
ing the mass conservation across the interface [119,122] , the rela-
tionship between the evaporation rate   ̇ ω , i.e . the local evaporation
mass flow rate per unit surface, and the velocity can be derived as

interface can be expressed as

In some simple situations such as static liquid evaporation, one
can set up a velocity potential to derive the velocity as did by Tan-
guy et al. [119] . Similarly, the contribution of the recoiling pressure
should  be  added  to  the  pressure  jump  to  account  for  the  evap-
oration effects. The term accounting for the discontinuity of the
viscous normal component should also be modified compared to
that without phase change, as the velocity is no longer continu-
ous across the interface. Consequently, the pressure jump condition
across the interface reads as [123]

where σ is the surface tension coefficient.

The first-order jump condition refers to the Rankine-Hugoniot
jump [124,125] across the interface to respect the energy conser-
vation and the mass conservation:

where h
lg  is the latent heat of evaporation. The evaporation rate
for  sharp  interface  methods  can  be  directly  calculated  from  this
kind  of  jump  conditions  in  interface-resolved  detailed  numerical
simulation.

Numerical difficulties arise in accurately imposing these jump
conditions  especially  the  Rankine-Hugoniot  jumps  for  heat  and
mass  transfers  according  to  Tanguy  et  al.  [119] .  In  order  to  dis-
cretize the jump conditions sharply, instead of smearing out the
discontinuous terms near the interface, the GFM [121] is utilized

Fig. 10.  Illustration of the GFM for a variable A which displays a discontinuity on
the interface.

i will usually require the value at x

as a powerful technique, which has been applied to incompress-
ible flow  with  phase change  [117,126] and  compressible reacting
flows [127] . Fig. 10 illustrates the GFM for a variable A which dis-
plays a discontinuity on the interface. As expected, difference sten-
cils for cell x
i + 1 , which is invalid
for numerical discretization due to the discontinuity. Consequently,
the GFM creates an artificial continuous profile that accounts for
the jump conditions on the interface and provides a ghost value at
x
i + 1 to keep the discretization uniform. While the level set method
provides an implicit representation of the interface, the GFM al-
lows an explicit representation of the interface jump conditions.
Thus, the overall level set/GFM scheme is quite easy to implement
in complex configurations.

In the framework of the level set/GFM combination, Liu et al.
[128] have proposed a general method for enforcing interface jump
conditions on irregular domains. The jump conditions were spec-
ified  as  a  linear  combination  of  the  jump  of  a  variable  and  the
jump  of  its  normal  derivative.  Special  care  was  devoted  to  the
treatment  of  the  normal  derivative  jump,  in  which  the  normal
derivative jump was rewritten as three separate terms correspond-
ing to the coordinate directions. Although this division smears out
the  tangential  derivatives,  it  correctly  captures  the  jump  in  the
normal  derivative  and  allows  one  to  deal  with  the  jump  condi-
tions in a dimension by dimension fashion. This method is robust,
easy to implement and symmetric, making the fast iterative solver
workable for large-scale simulations. In the same framework, some
state-of-the-art numerical methods have also been developed for
the Dirichlet boundary condtions [124,129] , the Neumann bound-
ary condtions [130] , the Robin boundary conditions [120,131] , and
the mixed boundary conditions [132] . Interested reader could refer
to these references for more details.

During  the  procedure  of  imposing  the  jump  conditions  (or
boundary  conditions),  the  ghost  values  are  required  to  keep  the
discretization uniform in the following situations:

1) As  the  interface  moves,  the  grid  cells  swept  by  the  interface
at two consecutive time steps t n and t n + 1 may no longer have
valid values for A due to the discontinuities. For example, the
grid cell of the dark point with a question mark in Fig. 11 .
2) Even for a still-interface case, the discretization stencil passes
across the interface and extends to the other-side subdomain
where no valid values exist.

A popular approach to provide such ghost values is using an ex-
trapolation method to extend A from its known subdomain to the
unknown one. In particular, Aslam [134] proposed a general way
for multidimensional extrapolation. Arbitrary orders of polynomial
extrapolation can be formulated in this approach by simply solv-
ing a series of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently,
McCaslin  et  al.  [135]  have  proposed  a  fast  marching  approach
to  the  multidimensional extrapolation.  Instead  of  converging  the

76

sion has been validated by a theoretical test, in which a droplet is
upward pushed due to the generated Stefan flow in a top-opened
container [119] , and applied to many problems such as [117,137] .

Recently, Lee et al. [138] have also presented an improved ap-
proach to reduce the numerical oscillations, spurious currents and
mass flux errors. The approach features a diffused interface and a
post-advection velocity correction to ensure accurate velocity di-
vergence in the interfacial cells. In particular, the correction up-
dates the original velocity field twice to satisfy the divergence-free
condition prior to the standard projection method. This treatment
can help mitigate the spurious pressure fluctuations by maintain-
ing consistency between density and velocity jumps at all times.

PDEs to steady state, this approach solves the non-homogeneous
Hamilton–Jacobi equations, which are mathematically identical to
the steady-state PDEs, by using the FMM. Results showed that the
FMM extrapolation method reduces the computational cost com-
pared to the PDE extrapolation method. More details on the math-
ematical formulations of these two extrapolations can be found in
Appendix A .

Actually, since only a narrow band close to the interface needs
ghost values for the GFM, one does not really need to solve the
PDEs to steady state in the whole domain, but can advance them
only  in  a  few  steps  in  the  narrow  band  region.  As  a  result,  the
computational  cost  of  the  PDE  extrapolation  remains  acceptable.
Furthermore, the directional derivatives of T and Y in the normal
direction  can  be  used  conveniently  to  calculate  the  evaporation
rate.

3.2.2. Navier–Stokes equations and divergence-free velocity extension
The projection method [136] is an advantageous tool for dis-
cretizing the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations because the
velocity and the pressure fields are decoupled. This method con-
sists of three steps: (1) obtain an intermediate velocity field at a
new time step n + 1 by advancing the momentum equation with-
out pressure term; (2) calculate the pressure through the pressure
Poisson equation; and (3) correct the velocity field to ensure con-
tinuity using the pressure gradient.

In simulations of evaporating two-phase flows, however, the ve-
locity becomes no longer continuous across the interface due to
the Stefan flow. When the GFM formula is used to address the ve-
locity jump during the above prejection steps, extending the ghost
velocities  from  liquid/gas  phase  to  gas/liquid  phase  is  necessary.
Nguyen et al. [122] once proposed such an extension method for
reactive interface, and the ghost velocities were simply evaluated
from Eq. (35) as

However,  this  extension  may  lead  to  unrealistic  mass  predic-
tions for liquid–gas interface with high density ratio, as pointed
out by Tanguy et al. [119] . In particular, they addressed that the
liquid  phase  velocity  extension  is  not  fully  satisfactory  because
the  extension  does  not  respect  the  divergence-free  condition  in
the whole domain. To solve this problem, they presented an im-
provement  of  the  liquid  velocity  field  extension  to  preserve  the
divergence-free condition on the interface. The detailed descritiza-
tion can be found in Appendix B . This improved velocity exten-

The  evaporation  models  based  on  the  point-source  assump-
tion have been extensively used to determine droplet evaporation
rate in the past two decades [3] . Realistic liquid topologies, how-
ever,  will  inevitably  violate  the  assumption  because  of  deforma-
tion and internal circulation. Recent interface-resolved DNS meth-
ods  are  able  to  calculate  the  evaporation  rate  directly  from  the
first-order jump conditions, and can deal with evaporation on ir-
regular evolving interfaces. We refer to the method that calculates
 ̇ ω  from the temeprature jump condition as the Heat Flux based
Model (HFM) and that from the species concentration jump con-
dition as the Species Mass Flux based Model (SMFM), respectively.
For convenience, only mono-component liquid phase is considered
in this section. When the liquid is multi-component [139] , the cal-
culation of the evaporation rate will be slightly more complicated.
The HFM for evaporation relies on a basic assumption that the
interface temperature has already reached the steady state satura-
tion temperature T sat , which for example is the wet bulb tempera-
ture or the boiling temperature. The value of T sat can be estimated
via a psychrometric chart and/or empirical correlations [140] . Ac-
cording to this assumption, the evaporation rate is totally driven by
the net conductive heat flux density. As a result, the temperature
equation Eq. (31) can be solved separately in the liquid and gas
subdomains with a Dirichlet boundary condition T (cid:12)
on
l
the interface. Note that a saturation temperature difference exits
due to the pressure jump across the interface, leading to a ques-
tion of what value should be chosen for T (cid:12)
. The detailed discus-
sion on how to determine T (cid:12)
can be found in Appendix C . Once
the temperature field is solved, Eq. (37) is available to evaluate the
evaporation rate   ̇ ω , making it consistent with the net heat flux on
the interface:
→
 ̇ ω = [ λ∇T ·
n ] (cid:12)/h
lg

g  = T (cid:12)

= T (cid:12)

(40)

In  particular,  when  more  heat  flows  into  the  interface  than
flows out, the heat will be absorbed by the liquid just near the
interface, leading to liquid evaporation. When more heat flows out
than flows in, a condensation process happens.

In contrast, the SMFM for evaporation does not use any restric-
tive assumptions. It is suitable for more general situations because
the species gradient, which is the driving force for evaporation in
this  model,  can  interact  with  the  temperature  field.  In  the  case
of mono-component liquid, the mass fraction Y is of interest only
in the gas phase. That is, the species equation of Eq. (32) can be
solved only in the gas phase with a Dirichlet boundary condition
for the vapor concentration on the interface Y (cid:12)
vap . The vapor pres-
sure on the interface is expected to be the saturation pressure p (cid:12)
vap ,
which  and Y (cid:12)
vap  can  be  given  by  the  Clausius-Clapeyron  relation
as:

where p atm is the ambient pressure, m vap is the molar mass of the
vapor, R is the perfect gas constant, T B  is the liquid boiling tem-
perature for the ambient pressure and m g is the molar mass of the
ambient gas. Eq. (38) is now available to evaluate the evaporation
rate   ̇ ω while Eq. (37) imposes the necessary condition for the tem-
perature field. Because the gradient of the mass fraction is zero in
the liquid phase,   ̇ ω is derived from Eq. (38) as

 ̇ ω =

Comparatively, the HFM considers that the interface tempera-
ture is equal to the saturation temperature, whereas the SMFM al-
lows variations of interface temperature in regards to the chemical
composition of the gas phase on the interface. As a consequence,
the HFM is limited to phase change computations of a single com-
ponent liquid with its vapor (boiling) in the literature, whereas the
SMFM is applicable to accounting for two chemical species in the
gas phase (droplet evaporation in an inert gas for instance). It is
noteworthy, however, that the HFM can also handle droplet evap-
oration  in  ambient gas  phase under  certain circumstances when
the interface temperature has reached a steady state condition (the
wet  temperature  for  instance).  In  this  case,  providing  a  species
solver for the HFM is of interest [141,142] .

Despite of its generality in application, the sequential calcula-
tion procedure of the SMFM is fragile and unstable for high evapo-
ration flux cases. In such situations the denominator in Eq. (43) , i.e .
1 − Y (cid:12)
vap , approaches zero, which significantly amplifies the small
errors near the interface. To reduce the errors, smaller time step
is usually required, making the computational cost increases ex-
ponentially  [141] .  Son  [143]  tried  to  address  this  issue  by  us-
ing a Newton–Raphson iterative algorithm to restrict the interface
temperature  and  therefore  obtain  a  sufficiently  large  denomina-
tor. However, this modification was not physically correct because
the modified interface temperature could not approach the boiling
temperature.

As introduced above, the HFM and SMFM each exhibit strengths
and shortcomings. Recently, Villegas et al. [137] have combined the
HFM and SMFM to develop an improved effective method for cal-
culating the evaporation rate. Specifically, the species equation of
Eq. (32) is solved with a prescribed Robin boundary condition on
the interface, which is derived from Eq. (38) as following:
(cid:12)
 ̇ ω Y
(44)
where   ̇ ω  is  calculated  from  Eq.  (37)  based  on  the  heat  flux
across the interface. Once the species equation is solved, the non-
homogeneous interface temperature can be determined by revers-
ing the Clausius-Clapeyron relation of Eqs. (41) and (42) :

→

(45)

(46)

Hence,  the  temperature  equation  can  be  solved  with  a  non-
homogeneous  Dirichlet  boundary  condition.  In  this  hybrid  ap-
proach, the same set of equations are solved as those of the SMFM,
while the overall algorithm has been reversed. Unlike the SMFM,
this approach is stable even if the gas phase is saturated of va-
por. As such, this approach can handle both evaporation and boil-
ing  depending  on  the  external  condition  without  requiring  any
sensors.

To summarize, this section concerns recent progress in DNS of
evaporating two-phase flows using the level set method. Numeri-
cal obstacles introduced by the evaporation process are discussed,
which stem from the potential for unphysical pressure oscillations,
spurious velocity fields and mass flux errors across the interface.
The well-established treatments are also presented. Recently, the
interface-resolved  method  has  been  further  extended  to  couple
evaporation with combustion. Shao et al. [142] firstly incorporated
droplet combustion with the level set method and succeeded in
simulating the single n -heptane droplet and binary-droplet com-
bustion  process.  Irfan  and  Muradoglu  [145]  successfully  coupled
detailed combustion mechanism with the front tracking method to
simulate the falling droplet combustion. These advanced methods
offer the potential to really study the underlying physics of spray
combustion.

4. Application of the level set method to atomization and
evaporation

With the development of the level set method and the com-
putational capacity, the detailed numerical simulation of atomiza-
tion and evaporation has drawn considerable attention. In the sec-
tion, we give an overview on simulations of atomization and evap-
oration with the level set method, including the primary atomiza-
tion, the secondary atomization, and the interfaces with evapora-
tion. The relevant mechanisms and model developments are also
discussed.

4.1. Primary atomization

In the recent years, there have been a lot of effort s to inves-
tigate the primary atomization. The typical numerical results from
the recent ten-year studies are summarized in Fig. 12 and Table S3.
For completeness, we include some results by using other inter-
face tracking methods. Here we display four types of atomization,
namely, straight jet, crossflow jet, impinging jet and swirling jet.
These four types of atomization are usually related to diesel en-
gine, gas turbines, rocket engine, and aircraft engine, respectively.
Straight jet stands for the liquid jet injecting into still gas or the
liquid jet surrounded by a coaxial flow of gas. Crossflow jet refers
to the liquid jet injected into a gaseous crossflow. Impinging jet
stands  for  the  collision  between  two  cylindrical  liquid  jets,  and
swirling jet refers to the liquid jet that has azimuthal swirl.

For the straight jet simulations, Kim et al. [146,147] investigated
the primary breakup of a liquid round jet by a coaxial flow of gas
by using the RLSG method [72] coupled with a Lagrangian spray
model. The density ratio of the liquid and gas is 5. The Reynolds
and  Weber  numbers  of  the  liquid  are  295  and  0.6  respectively.
The  Reynolds  and  Weber  numbers  of  the  gas  based  on  the  gas
thickness  are  3770  and  34  respectively.  The  numerical  result  of
the interface is qualitatively well matched with the experimental
observation by Marmottant and Villermaux [148] , as illustrated in
Fig. 12 (d). It shows that the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability, pro-
ducing axial perturbation, and the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability,
producing azimuthal perturbation, contribute to the formation of
ligaments both in the experiment and the simulation. Indeed, the
KH instability refers to an interfacial instability caused by shear be-
tween the slow fluid stream and the fast fluid stream while the RT
instability occurs when the interface between two fluids of differ-
ent densities experiences a pressure gradient opposing the density
gradient.

By  using  the  RLSG  method,  Herrmann  took  great  effort s
[72,149-151]  to  simulate  the  atomization  process  in  its  entirety
with large range of length scales, which is shown in Fig. 12 (e). The
straight liquid jet into stagnant dense air under diesel engine con-
ditions was investigated in [151] , in which the density ratio of the

liquid and gas is 34, the viscosity ratio is 100, the Reynolds num-
ber is 50 0 0, and the Weber number is 17,0 0 0. It was found that the
turbulence is the driving mechanism or at least initiator of atom-
ization within the first 20 diameters downstream of the injector.
The drop size distribution is remarkably dependent on the grid res-
olution, and approaches the log normal distribution with increas-
ing the grid resolution, which confirms that the grid independence
test must be carefully conducted for atomization simulations [12] .
Shinjo  and  Umemura  [152]  also  made  an  intensive  study  of
the straight primary atomization of liquid injected at high speed
into  still  air  as  shown  in  Fig.  12 (a).  The  level  set  method  and
the  Multi-interface  Advection  and  Reconstruction  Solver  (MARS)
method were used. The Reynolds number is located in the range of
440–1470 and the Weber number is in the range of 1270–14,100.
It is quite impressive that the total number of grid points in the
largest case reaches six billion and the grid resolution is 0.35 μm to
resolve the small droplet. A series of physical processes have been
observed, including ligament formation, development of surface in-
stability and droplet formation. The ligament formation is triggered
by the liquid jet tip roll-up when the local gas Weber number is
O(1), and later ligaments are produced from the disturbed liquid
core surface in the upstream. The disturbances are fed from the
liquid jet tip toward upstream by vortices and droplet re-collision.
The dominant mode is the short-wave mode driven by propagative
capillary wave from the ligament tip, and the long-wave (Rayleigh)
mode is not seen due to the absent injection nozzle. The liquid
jet tip effects were further identified in [153] . The liquid jet front
umbrella formation, atomization at the umbrella edge, mixing in
the  recirculation  flow  region  and  droplet  generation  mode  were
demonstrated in detail. The mechanism of liquid core surface in-
stability was later investigated in [154] and it was suggested that
the  dominant  mechanism  could  be  the  Tollmien-Schlichting  (TS)
instability in the parameter range of the study.

Desjardins  and  Co-authors  [68,155]  simulated  the  turbu-
lent  straight  primary  atomization  by  using  a  conservative  level
set/ghost fluid method, as shown in Fig. 12 (g). The density ratio
and viscosity ratio are 40. The Reynolds and Weber numbers are
30 0 0 and 10,0 0 0, respectively. The inflow conditions were obtained

by simulating a turbulent pipe. The results showed that the liq-
uid core has fully disintegrated by the end of the computational
domain.  The  spectrally  refined  interface  approach  with  sub-grid
resolution was also applied to the simulation of turbulent liquid
jets in quiescent air in [156] . The density ratio and viscosity ra-
tio are 40. The Reynolds number is located in the range of 20 0 0–
30 0 0 and the Weber number is in the range of 50 0–20 0 0. It was
demonstrated  that  the  early  interface  deformation  is  caused  by
turbulent eddies that carry sufficient kinetic energy to overcome
surface tension forces, which is consistent with the conclusion of
[6,7] , and the aerodynamics effects play an important role in the
turbulent atomization of liquid jets. Effects of Weber number and
Reynolds  number  were  studied  and  detailed  structures,  such  as,
ligament rupture, bubble entrapment and drop splashing were ob-
served. An air pocket in the liquid formed when the interface was
pinched between two counter-rotating vortices. Recently, McCaslin
and Desjardins [157] investigated the primary air-blast atomization
of  a  planar  liquid  shear  and  modal  analysis  of  flow  instabilities
has been conducted, demonstrating the streamwise growth of the
shear layer and decay of the transverse vorticity.

Ménard  et  al.  [88] investigated the  primary straight atomiza-
tion by the coupled level set/VOF/ghost fluid method, as shown in
Fig. 12 (c). The density ratio is 28 and the viscosity ratio is 120. The
turbulent intensity of the inflow is 0.05. The Reynolds and Weber
numbers are 5800 and 11,600, respectively. It showed that the 3D
waves on the jet interface occur very closely to the jet exit. These
surface instabilities are of great importance in the liquid atomiza-
tion.  Based  on  the  DNS  database,  the  Eulerian-Lagrangian  Spray
Atomization (ELSA) model was further evaluated in [158] and im-
proved in [159] . By using the same method, Cousin et al. [160] per-
formed the simulation of primary atomization of a liquid jet dis-
charged by a low-pressure compound nozzle. The results with the
internal inflow condition agreed well with the experiment. The liq-
uid jet angle and the characteristic length scale of the perturba-
tion were also well predicted quantitatively. Arienti and Sussman
[161] performed the sharp-interface simulation of Diesel injector
by  using  the  CLSVOF  method.  The  mean  and  root  mean  square
(rms) values of axial velocity compared favorably with the exper-

iment. Other effort s to simulate the straight jet include the work
by Chenadec and Pitsch [162] (shown in Fig. 12 (j)) and the work
by Tomar et al. [163] .

Through  simulations  of  straight  jet  by  using  the  level  set
method,  the  correlation  between  liquid  breakup  and  vortex  dy-
namics has been investigated systematically [164-167] . The density
ratio is in the range of 1.11–20. The viscosity ratio is in the range
of  29–455.  The  Reynolds  number  is  in  the  range  of  320–50 0 0.
The Weber number is 230,0 0 0. It has been demonstrated that the
counter-rotating, streamwise vortices around ligaments contribute
to the instability behavior for jets flowing into like-density fluid in
[164,165] . This implies that the density difference cannot fully ex-
plain the azimuthal instability observed by Marmottant and Viller-
maux [148] and Kim et al. [146,147] . The hole formation was found
to be correlated with the hairpin and helical vortices, and dom-
inated by inertial forces rather than capillary force, which differs
from previous studies [152,156] . In addition, by investigating pla-
nar  liquid  jet,  Zandian  et  al.  [166]  distinguished  three  atomiza-
tion cascades based on the gas Weber number We g and the liquid
Reynolds number Re
l and low We g ,
bridge formation at moderate Re
l and high We g , lobe corrugation at
l and low We g . These three distinct mechanisms have also
high Re
been analysed in [167] . It shows that the interaction between the
hairpins and KH roller explains the performance of the lobes, and
the formation of the lobes is attributed to the streamwise overlap-
ping of two oppositely oriented hairpin vortices on each side of
the lobe.

l , i.e ., lobe stretching at low Re

To  examine the  above relevant studies in the  Re - Oh  space,  it
turns out that most of the straight jet simulations belong to the
regime of the second wind induced breakup, as shown in Fig. 13 .
Only little work [164-167] belongs to the atomization regime. Stud-
ies over other regimes are required in future to give a full map of
the problem.

For  the  crossflow  jet  simulations,  Herrmann  [168,169]  per-
formed detailed simulations of primary atomization of a turbulent
liquid jet injected into a subsonic gaseous crossflow, which was an-
alyzed experimentally [170] , by using the RLSG method, as shown
in Fig. 12 (f). The density ratio is 10 and the viscosity ratio is 6. The
jet Reynolds and Weber numbers are 14,079 and 2178, respectively.
The crossflow Reynolds and Weber numbers are 570,0 0 0 and 330,
respectively. The results indicated that breakup of the liquid jet oc-
curs due to two main mechanisms. In the first mode, the insta-

jet.).

bility waves on the liquid column generate role-ups and continue
to grow along the jet axis until baglike structures form, which is
attributed to the KH instability. Note that this mechanism for sur-
face waves is contrary to the results conducted by Xiao et al. [8,9] .
In the second mode, the corrugations on the liquid jet surface are
stretched out into the ligaments at the sides of the jet near the in-
jector exit, which is attributed to the RT instability. In addition, the
smaller drops show a strong grid dependency, whereas the larger
drops collapse to a log-normal distribution. By using the same con-
figurations, the impact of density ratio on the liquid core dynam-
ics was further studied [171,172] . It was shown that the increase in
density ratio causes a noticeable increase in liquid core penetration
and results in a decrease in the wavelength of the most dominant
feature.

Behzad et al. [173] recently investigated a non-turbulent liquid
jet injected transversely into a high pressure gaseous crossflow by
using the level set method. The density ratio is in the range of 2–
50 and the viscosity ratio is in the range of 2–10. The crossflow
Reynolds number is in the range of 60 0–120 0 and the crossflow
Weber number is in the range of 60–96. The existence of shear in-
stability on the jet periphery was identified as the primary desta-
bilization mechanism. The temporal growth of such azimuthal in-
stabilities leads to the formation of interface corrugations, which
are  eventually  sheared  off of  the jet  surface as  sheet-like struc-
tures. The proposed instability mechanism is inherently an inviscid
mechanism, contrary to the boundary layer stripping mechanism
that is relied on a viscous interpretation. Behzad et al. [174] also
performed temporal linear stability analysis of a jet in crossflow,
and found the stability characteristics of the most amplified modes
obtained from the numerical simulations are in good agreement
with those of the stability analysis.

Owkes and Desjardins [175] conducted simulations of the atom-
ization of a liquid jet in crossflow by using a conservative level set
method, as shown in Fig. 12 (k). The density ratio is 137 and the
momentum flux ratio is 10. The liquid Reynolds and Weber num-
bers are 5430 and 50 0 0, respectively. The gas Reynolds and Weber
numbers are 9490 and 500, respectively. The effects of the round-
edged and the sharp-edged injectors have been investigated and
the results show that the sharp-edged injector which produces tur-
bulent inflow significantly enhances the atomization process. The
jet penetration, droplet size and velocity distributions were con-
sistent with the experimental results. Pai et al. [110,176] investi-
gated the effects of Weber numbers of the crossflow on the liquid
primary atomization, as shown in Fig. 12 (b). The crossflow Weber
number is in the range of 500 ∼ 3000. By using parametric study,
it was found that the crossflow Weber number controls the char-
acteristic thickness of the liquid structures, while the liquid Weber
number controls the shapes of the liquid structures, such as blobs,
tubes or sheets.

Li  and  Soteriou  [177]  simulated  the  liquid  jet  atomization
in  a  gaseous  crossflow  with  intermediate  Weber  numbers.  The
crossflow  Weber  number  is  in  the  range  of  10–160  and  the
crossflow  Reynolds  number  is  in  the  range  of  1391–5562.  The
liquid  Reynolds  number  is  in  the  range  of  7896–31,583.  The
simulation  was  able  to  reproduce  the  experimentally  obtained
downstream  droplet  volumetric  flux  which  exhibits  a  horseshoe
shape, as shown in Fig. 12 (n). The major findings include: (1) For-
mation of “(cid:21)” shape windward waves was observed and explained
by the combined upward and lateral surface motion. (2) The exis-
tence of RT instability as the primary mechanism for the windward
waves was verified. (3) A peculiar “three - streak - two - mem-
brane” liquid structure was identified at the lowest Weber number
and explained as the consequence of the symmetric recirculation
zones behind the jet column. Li et al. [178] further conducted sim-
ulations of atomization and evaporation in a liquid jet in crossflow
for a realistic purpose by coupling with the evaporation model. It

tively. The numerical results showed that turbulent inflow can in-
duce liquid sheet breakup near the nozzle exit, reduce the stiffness
of the liquid sheet, and lead to the statistically homogeneous dis-
tribution of small-scale liquid structures in the radial direction. The
fluctuating velocity in the recirculation zone is statistically simi-
lar to isotropic turbulent and the liquid sheet can generate high
shear layers to produce anisotropic small-scale fluctuations. Shao
et al. [185] further investigated the detailed sheet, ligament and
droplet formation in the swirling primary atomization. In general,
the numerical results agreed well with experimental observations.
The surface tension, pressure difference and swirling effect were
found to contribute to the contraction and extension of the liquid
sheet, and the ligament formation is partially attributed to the ex-
tension of the liquid hole. It is interesting to note that the move-
ment of hairpin vortex exerts an anti-radial direction force on the
sheet surface and leads to a sheet thinness, which is similar to the
study of Jarrahbashi et al. [165] for straight jet.

In summary, detailed numerical simulations with the level set
method have been extensively applied to primary atomization and
are  able  to  reproduce  experimental  obvervastions,  even  provide
much  more  abundant  information  than  experimental  measure-
ments. This offers an efficient way to understand various primary
atomization in detail. However, the current simulation conditions
are far from the experimental conditions of realistic applications.
With increasing Reynolds number and Weber number to approach
realistic  experimental  conditions,  the  computational  cost  will  be
extremely high even prohibitive. The obtained mechanisms of liq-
uid primary breakup are different or contrary even in similar con-
ditions, and the unified mechanism is still on the way ahead. In ad-
dition, the size distribution of small liquid structures in the atom-
ization process is of particular importance. Some simulation results
indicated that the drop size distribution in atomization obeys the
log-normal distribution [152,169] . However, a log-normal distribu-
tion cannot be obtained unless the probability of breakup is inde-
pendent of the particle size according to Epstein [186] . But in fact
the breakup probability is proportional to second or third power of
the particle size. This inconsistency of theory and numerical results
needs further investigations.

4.2. Secondary atomization

The secondary atomization is the process of breakup of drops
or  ligament  structures  into  smaller  droplets.  It  usually  involves
in complex phenomena, such  as, single droplet deformation and
breakup,  droplet  collision,  droplet  impact  on  surface.  Although
some models have been developed to describe the secondary at-
omization process, for instance, the Taylor analogy breakup (TAB)
model and the wave model, these models are not universal, with
limited  accuracy.  This  is  partially  due  to  the  fact  that  the  influ-
encing factor and control mechanism of the secondary atomization
have not yet been fully understood so that the assumptions based
on which these models were established are suspicious. As a result,
the level set method has also been extensively applied to investi-
gate the mechanism of secondary atomization.

4.2.1. Single droplet deformation and breakup

There are two major concerns to investigate the single droplet
deformation  and  breakup.  One  is  the  mechanism  of  secondary
breakup, and the other is the drag coefficient of the deformable
droplet.

Identifying various breakup modes for droplet fragmentation is
the basic step to analyze the mechanism of breakup. Fig. 15 shows
different breakup modes identified by previous studies in Oh

was found that when the injected liquid is at the same tempera-
ture as the crossflow gas, the vapor distribution is similar to that of
the droplets. When the injected liquid is colder than the crossflow
gas, the vapor distribution is center peaked.

When  summarizing  the  above  studies  in  the  regime  map  of
breakup in the We - q space, it is found that most of the crossflow
jet studies belong to the regime of column breakup, as shown in
Fig. 14 . It would be interesting to explore the breakup characteris-
tics in other regimes in the future studies.

For the impinging jet simulations, Arienti et al. [179] performed
a simulation of primary atomization by using the CLSVOF method
with an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique, as shown in
Fig. 12 (i). The density ratio is 832 and the viscosity ratio is 50. The
Reynolds number in the pipe ranges from 40 0 0 to 12,0 0 0. The lin-
ear  instability  analysis  suggested  that  the  KH  instability  may  be
at the base of ligament formation. Chen et al. [180] and Ma et al.
[181] explored detailed flow physics associated with the temporal
evolution and spatial development of a impinging jet over a wide
range of Reynolds (40.4–11,724) and Weber numbers (27.5–2987),
as shown in Fig. 12 (l). Five flow patterns were reproduced, namely,
liquid chain, closed rim, open rim, unstable rim and impact wave.
As for the impact wave pattern, the entire flow evolution can be
divided into four regions: the jet impingement, the flapping sheet,
the ligaments, and the droplets. It was also found that the mean
velocity profile has a profound effect on the stability characteris-
tics.

The swirling jet is significantly important when applied to gas
turbine  combustors  as  an  approach  to  enhance  fuel-air  mixing
and flame stabilization. For numerical simulations, Li and Soteriou
[182,183] simulated a realistic injector. The density ratio is 650 and
the viscosity ratio is 83. The momentum flux ratio is 9.4 and the
gas Weber number is 155. The qualitative feature of the flow is
described, as shown in Fig. 12 (h), and the results are contrasted
against experiment data, providing a qualitative validation. Fuster
et al. [184] also conducted numerical simulations of a swirling liq-
uid flow with an emphasis on the potential of the code so that
only mesh size test and drop size distribution were presented. Re-
cently, Shao et al. [111] have performed detailed numerical sim-
ulations of a swirling liquid jet by using a conservative level set
method with the maximum number of grids of about one billion,
as shown in Fig. 12 (m). The density is 20 and the viscosity ratio is
10. The Reynolds and Weber numbers are 20 0 0 and 222, respec-

and gas flow. It is observed that the breakup modes can be clas-
sified in terms of the droplet Weber number for the Newton fluid
in which the droplet Ohnesorge number is roughly less than 0.1. As
non-Newton fluid is beyond of the scope of the present review, the
following studies mainly lie in the low droplet Ohnesorge number
regimes.

Early studies on the droplet deformation and breakup are basi-
cally in two dimensional configurations. Balabel et al. [188] used
the  level  set  method  to  simulate  oscillation  and  deformation  of
an initially elongated droplet in a quiescent fluid under the sur-
face  tension  effect.  The  predicted  oscillation  process  agrees  well
with  that  from  the  linear  theory.  Using  a  mass  conserving  level
set  method,  Ni  et  al.  [189]  studied  the  effect  of  a  wall  on  the
droplet motion by setting a circular droplet between parallel walls
and it was demonstrated that the Karman vortex street can explain
the oscillatory mechanism of the falling droplet. For two or three
droplets, the competition between wall repulsion and inter-droplet
repulsion  decides  the  droplet  movement.  Liu  and  Xu  [190]  used
the classical level set method to simulate the droplet deformation
and breakup in a two-dimensional gas flow. Four typical breakup
modes, namely, oscillation, bag breakup, sheet stripping breakup,
and shear breakup were observed. It was found that the gas We-
ber  number  is  of  the  most  importance  to  distinguish  different
breakup modes. In addition, multimode breakup containing shear-
ing breakup and piercing breakup occurs when increasing the den-
sity ratio up to 10 0 0.

Most of the above studies mainly handle two-dimensional, low-
density  ratio,  and  low  Weber  number  conditions,  which  are  be-
lieved  to  be  limited  by  numerical  algorithms  and  computational
capacity.  However,  the  actual  secondary  atomization  process  is
usually three-dimensional and cannot be treated as axisymmetric
deformation and breakup. Hence, three-dimensional simulation is
imperative.

Xiao  et  al.  [191]  performed  three-dimensional  simulations  of
drop  deformation  and  breakup  at  high  density  ratio  of  order
O (10 0 0) by using the CLSVOF method. It was found that the RT in-
stability dominates the drop breakup in the Weber number range
of  3.4  to  96.  The  critical  Weber  number  separating  deformation
and breakup regimes is also in good agreement with the experi-
mental data. Xiao et al. [192] also performed simulations of drop
deformation  and  breakup  at  different  Weber  numbers  in  super-
sonic flow. The bag breakup, bag stamen breakup and multimode
breakup modes were reproduced and the RT instability was also
found to determine the breakup morphology for the studied Weber

number ranges. Yang et al. [193] investigated transitions of defor-
mation to bag breakup and bag to bag-stamen breakup for droplets
subjected  to  gas  flow  by  using  the  CLSVOF  method.  It  indicated
that the breakup modes in the bag-type regimes are determined
by the ratio of droplet diameter to the wavelength of the most un-
stable RT wave. By using the same method, Yang et al. [194] fur-
ther investigated the influence of density ratio on the secondary
atomization under highly unstable condition, and the breakup pro-
cesses under different density ratios are shown in Fig. 16 . It was
observed that the larger extent of the fragmentation occurs with
increasing the density ratio. The droplet dynamics is notably influ-
enced by the density ratio even if it exceeds 32, which is not con-
sistent with the study of Aalburg et al. [195] who found that the
deformation and breakup dynamics are independent of the density
ratio when it exceeds 32 at small Oh number.

Other studies focus on the drag coefficient of deformable liq-
uid droplets. Compared to the solid particle, the determination of
drag  coefficient  of  liquid  droplet  becomes  more  formidable  due
to surface pulsations, internal circulation, as well as deformation
and breakup. Suh and Lee [196] firstly performed the calculation
of  drag  and  lift  of  a  deformable  droplet  in  shear  flow  by  us-
ing the level set method. A feedback force that can maintain the
droplet position is utilized to determine the acting force on the
droplet. They found that the drag and lift forces depend strongly
on the deformation characteristics. Yang et al. [194] investigated
the  drag  coefficient  of  a  droplet  before  breakup.  It  was  shown
that  the  drag  coefficient  is  mainly  determined  by  the  recircula-
tion region, i.e ., a larger recirculation region leads to a higher drag
coefficient.

Recently, Shao et al. [197] systematically studied the effects of
Weber number, density ratio and viscosity ratio on the unsteady
drag coefficient of a deformable droplet. The droplet Weber num-
bers were in the range of 1–10, and the density ratio and viscosity
ratio  were  in  the  ranges  of  6.25–40  and  2–10 0 0,  respectively.  It
was found that the unsteady term (including the density ratio) has
the most significant effect on the unsteady drag coefficient and the
Weber number secondly. The viscosity ratio has little effect on the
drag coefficient owing to low Oh numbers in the study.

Although  some  progresses  have  been  made  for  the  single
droplet deformation and breakup by using the level set method,

82

further investigations are required to explain the inconsistent re-
sults obtained by the simulations, such as the works by Yang et al.
[194]  and  Aalburg  et  al.  [195] .  Furthermore,  most  of  the  above
studies  are  in  the  range  of  low  droplet  Weber  number.  Droplet
breakup in high Weber number regimes, the dominating breakup
mechanism as well as the drop size distribution after breakup need
to  be  explored.  A  general  drag  coefficient  formulation  of  liquid
droplet considering the effect of deformation and internal circu-
lation also needs development.

4.2.2. Droplet collision

Droplet collision is expected to be a frequent event downstream
of the fuel injector and could significantly modify the spray and
combustion  characteristics.  Qian  and  Law  [198]  investigated  bi-
nary droplet collision dynamics and summarized all the collision
regimes in terms of the collision Weber number and the impact
parameter. The behaviors of droplet collision were summarized as
five distinct regimes, namely, coalescence after minor deformation,
bouncing,  coalescence  after  substantial  deformation,  coalescence
followed by separation for near head-on collisions, and coalescence
followed by separation for off-center collisions.

Tanguy and Berlemont [199] performed simulations of head-on
and off-center droplet collisions by using the level set method in
2005. The collision Weber number is in the range of 23–60. The
simulations could excellently reproduce the experimental observa-
tions from Ashgriz and Poo [200] , as shown in Fig. 17 . It is inter-
esting to note that a very thin liquid layer was observed in the
collision process during the simulation, which however is never to
be captured by the experiment. This thin liquid layer is expected
to be significant for the formation of satellite droplet.

Simulations by Pan and Suga [201] covered four regimes of col-
lision:  bouncing,  coalescence,  reflexive  separation  and  stretching
separation. The collision Weber number is in the range of 0.2–165.
The numerical results indicated that the mechanism of bouncing
collision is governed by the macroscopic dynamics. The mechanism
of satellite droplet formation was associated with the end pinch-
ing and the capillary wave instability becomes dominant for larger
impact  parameter.  Later,  Balabel  [202]  performed  simulations  of
two-dimensional binary droplet collision at relatively high collision

Weber numbers of 12.8, 156.8 and 460.8, corresponding to bounc-
ing, coalescence and reflexive separation regimes, respectively. It
was  found  that  the  surface  tension  is  a  stabilizing  force  in  coa-
lescence regime that prevents the separation of droplets, whereas
it acts as a destabilizing force in reflexive separation regime that
promotes the separation of droplets. However, it sometimes fails to
simulate the droplet bouncing when the collision Weber number is
very small. The simulation result indicates the coalescence regime,
whereas the experimental result indicates the bouncing regime at
the same collision Weber number. This is mainly attributed to the
fact that two approaching droplets will artifactually coalesce when
their interfaces are sufficiently close to each other (typically at a
distance on a grid cell) in the conventional level set method [201] .
To overcome this problem, Kwakkel et al. [203] proposed an exten-
sion of the CLSVOF method with a coalescence/breakup model. In
this method, each fluid droplet is described by a separated level set
function, and the coalescence is identified based on a film drainage
model that predicts if and when the two droplets will coalesce.
Simulations were performed in the range of 2.3 ∼ 61.4 for the col-
lision  Weber  number.  The  excellent  agreement  with  experimen-
tal  data  especially  at  the  small  collision  Weber  number  demon-
strates the capability of the method, but it should be noted that
the collision dynamics is strongly dependent on the prescribed film
drainage  time.  Balcazar  et  al.  [204]  proposed  a  multiple  marker
level set method to simulate the bouncing collision, in which the
multiple markers are introduced to represent each droplet. The bi-
nary droplet collision with bouncing outcome also agrees well with
the  experimental  data  for  the  collision  Weber  numbers  ranging
from 2.27 to 9.33.

To summarize, numerical simulations of droplet collision nearly
cover all the regimes and could reproduce the experimental ob-
servations with sufficient accuracy by using the level set method.
However, some questions still remain. For example, the criterion
for occurrence of each regime is not well defined, and numerical
simulations  with  the  level  set  method  could  help  to  distinguish
each regime with sufficient resolution. Three-dimensional simula-
tions of droplet collision with high collision Weber number is not
sufficient, and collision dynamics of multiple droplets has not been
established.

4.2.3. Droplet impact on surface

Drop impact on dry surface or liquid film is expected to be an-
other type of drop collision. Based on the impact Weber number,
Ohnesorge  number  and  non-dimensional  film  thickness,  droplet
impact on surface can form various phenomena like drop reced-
ing, jetting, splashing and spreading [205] .

Some  studies  focus  on  the  validation  of  numerical  methods
by  using  the  canonical  set  of  droplet  impact  on  surface.  Yokoi
[206]  performed  a  simulation  of  droplet  impact  on  a  thin  liq-
uid layer by using the CLSVOF method. The impact Weber num-
bers  were  426,  1706  and  6822,  which  remarkably  influence  the
crown shape. The phenomenon was found to be sensitive to the
grid resolution due to its multi-scale characteristics involving thin
liquid layer and pinch-off droplets. To prevent numerical coales-
cence of droplet and liquid surface at small impact Weber num-
ber, a multiple marker CLSVOF method was developed by Coyajee
and Boersma [207] . The idea of this method is similar to that of
Kwakkel et al. [203] and Balcazar et al. [204] for simulating droplet
collision. The drop trajectory and interfacial deformation observed
from experiment can be well captured by this method. McCaslin
and Desjardins [81] proposed a conservative level set method to
simulate droplet impact on liquid film. The impact Weber num-
ber, Ohnesorge number and film thickness were 598, 0.0014 and
0.116, respectively, and 512 × 1024 × 1024 grid points were used in
the  simulations.  The  radial  growth  of  the  splashing  lamella  was
compared to theory and the numerical result of Rieber and Frohn
[208] ,  and  good  agreement  has  been  achieved.  The  time  evolu-
tion of growth of the splashing lamella is shown in Fig. 18 , and
it can be seen that the rim of the crown becomes unstable as the
splashing lamella rises and ligaments form that finally pinch off
into droplets. Drop splash onto a liquid film was also treated as a
canonical set to validate a solver for DNS of gas-liquid flows with

the level set method by Shin et al. [209] . A highest resolution with
1024 3  meshes was run and detailed features of droplet ejection,
crown formation and rim instability were observed.

Some other studies focus on the dynamics of droplet impact on
surface. Lee et al. [210] investigated the two-dimensional splash-
ing and spreading phenomena by using the level set method. Good
agreement  with  experimental  data  was  observed  in  the  earlier
stage of crown formation, but discrepancies appeared in the later
stage  of  crown  spreading.  This  indicated  that  the  crown  shape
is axisymmetric in the earlier stage but shows three-dimensional
characteristics later. Liang et al. [211] quantitatively discussed the
influence  of  the  impact  Weber  number,  the  Reynolds  number,
and the dimensionless film thickness on the crown diameter and
height,  and  found  that  the  crown  height  increases  with  the  in-
creasing of the impact Weber number. The pressure difference in
the neck region and the velocity discontinuity have significant ef-
fect on the jet formation. The increase in the impact Weber num-
ber and drop diameter contributes to the formation of bubble rings
below the impacting droplet. Guo et al. [212] investigated the ef-
fects of impact velocity and the film thickness on the crown di-
ameter. It was shown that the higher the impact velocity is, the
earlier the splash emerges, and the spreading diameter decreases
with the increasing of the film thickness. Chai et al. [213] inves-
tigated the incipient droplet impact by using a conservative level
set  method.  The  impact  Weber  number,  Ohnesorge  number  and
film thickness were 297, 0.0019 and 0.29, respectively. It was found
that the pressure gradient and vortex are responsible for the neck
jet formation and evolution. With the inclined angle of the surface
increasing, the vortex effect becomes larger in the back side while
the pressure gradient is still dominant in the front side. It was also
observed that air bubbles are trapped below the impacting droplet
even though there is no explanation.

Droplet impact on different types of surfaces has also been in-
vestigated recently. Liu et al. [214] investigated the dynamic char-
acteristics of a droplet impacting a hydrophobic tube. It was found
that the surface hydrophobicity has a great influence on the dy-
namic  characteristics  of  the  film  spread.  The  pressure  difference
between  the  inside  and  outside  of  the  liquid  film  and  the  loca-
tion of the low pressure dominate the film spread, rebound and
splash. Yan and Li [215] performed simulation of droplet impact
on micro-scale rectangular grooved surface. The effects of groove
width, contact angle and impact velocity on the dynamic of the
droplet impact at low Weber numbers were investigated. It was
found that the vertical spreading diameter is less than the parallel
spreading diameter, and the dynamic characteristic of droplet im-
pact is influenced by both the contact angle and the groove width.
The above studies demonstrate that droplet impact on surface
succeeds to act as a canonical benchmark for validation of numer-
ical method on one hand. On the other hand, the mechanisms of
droplet impact on surface have been explored including bubble en-
trainment  below  the  droplet,  the  neck  jet  formation,  and  crown
formation  that  are  important  in  the  impact  dynamics.  However,
the explanation on the bubble entrainment is not sufficient with
the present low resolution of the impact region, and the dominant
mechanism of producing secondary droplets by splashing has not
yet been investigated [216] . In addition, multi-drop impact that is
usually encounted in applications has received far less attention.
All these issues need further investigations.

4.2.4. Atomization with turbulence

In realistic spray combustion applications, the atomization pro-
cess usually occurs with turbulence. For droplets that are smaller
than  the  smallest  turbulent  length  scale  (the  Kolmogorov  scale,
η),  point-particle  assumption  is  usually  used.  For  liquid  struc-
tures/droplets that are larger than η in dense spray region, studies
are limited but have drawn much attention with the recent devel-
opment of the level set method [217] .

Li and Jaberi [218] performed a simulation of two-dimensional
homogeneous  flow  with  liquid  plane  sheet  to  investigate  the
turbulence-interface  interaction  by  using  the  particle  level  set
method.  The  density  ratio  and  viscosity  ratio  are  both  in  the
range of 1–20. It was found that the rate of change of the inter-
face area is related to the work done by the surface tension. The
surface  tension  increases  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  when  the
interface  experiences  compression,  while  it  damps  the  turbulent
kinetic energy when the interface experiences stretching. Further-
more,  the  surface  tension  was  found  to  generate  strong  vortical
motions  close  to  the  interface  by  the  baroclinic  torque  effects.
Trontin et al. [219] performed a three-dimensional simulation of a
freely decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) flow with
a liquid plane sheet to understand interactions between small tur-
bulent scales and interface. The densities and viscosities are the
same for both phases. Two types of turbulence/interface interac-
tions have been obtained. For large Weber number, the energy is
transferred from the turbulence to the interface for the coalescence
of small droplet into larger drops. However, for lower Weber num-
ber, the interfacial energy is given back to the fluid. For all studied
Weber numbers, anisotropy and vorticity appear near the interface
resulting from the turbulence/interface interaction.

Recently, Shao et al. [220] have performed simulation of droplet
breakup in a forced HIT flow to investigate the interaction between
vortical  structures  and  the  interface  by  using  a  mass-conserving
level  set  method.  The  densities  and  viscosities  are  the  same  for
both phases. The temporal evolution of the liquid/gas interfaces is
shown in Fig. 19 . It was observed that the interface is slightly wrin-
kled at the early time and stretched and rolled up to numerous
tube-like/blob-like structures at the later times. The vorticity tends
to be perpendicular to the normal of the large-scale interface at an

early stage, and subsequently the normal alignment is mitigated
for large Weber numbers. This indicated that small droplets with
strong surface tension can resist the deformation induced by local
turbulent straining motion in the statistically stationary state.

The DNS database of atomization with turbulence has also been
used to improve atomization model. Duret et al. [221] performed
simulations of eight droplets breakup in a HIT flow over a large
range of liquid volume fractions and the database have been uti-
lized to improve the ELSA model [222] . It was found that the liq-
uid kinetic energy or the Favre averaged kinetic energy in the im-
proved equilibrium Weber number is close to the kinetic energy
on  the  interface.  A  statistical  analysis  of  the  equilibrium  Weber
number was then carried out to verify and improve the definition
given by the ELSA model. Ensemble averaging of the time evolution
of the interface density was also conducted to verify the interface
density equation. The improved ELSA model was compared with
the DNS and good agreement was achieved. Herrmann [10] pro-
posed a dual-scale modeling approach for phase interface dynam-
ics in the LES context based on the DNS data in a HIT flow. A re-
solved realization of the phase interface dynamics was explicitly
filtered to close the unclosed terms related to the phase interface,
including the effects of sub-filter turbulent eddies, surface tension,
and dissipation. Satisfactory agreement between LES and DNS was
obtained.

The  progress  in  interface-resolved  simulation  of  atomization
with turbulence is associated with the development of the level set
method and the advances in supercomputer. The liquid breakup in
HIT flow has been widely used to investigate turbulence/interface
interaction and improve atomization model. However, due to the
complexity, experimental data are required to validate the DNS re-
sults [217] . In addition, all the present DNS studies with fully re-
solved interface limit the density ratio to the range of 1–30, which
is expected to be higher in realistic spray combustion.

4.3. Integrated simulation of atomization

As  aforementioned,  atomization  is  a  typical  multi-scale  phe-
nomenon, in which the size of the smallest droplet may be several
orders smaller than the size of the atomizing liquid jet. This multi-
scale nature introduces a fundamental challenge to the interface-
resolved  simulations  of  atomization.  Specifically,  at  least  four  to
eight grid points across the droplet diameter are required to ob-
tain a physically reasonable representation of the droplet [152,223] .
As a result, huge computational resources would be consumed for
such integrated simulations of atomization.

To reduce the computational cost, multi-scale coupling meth-
ods have been developed, in which the Eulerian method is used to
capture the large-scale interfaces and the Lagrangian point-particle
(LPP)  method  is  used  to  track  the  small-scale  droplets,  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 20 . The coupling procedure usually consists of iden-
tification  of  liquid  structure,  removement  from  the  Eulerian  de-
scription, transfer to the Lagrangian description and, if necessary,
reverse transfer to the Eulerian description. Crucial to such cou-
pling methods is the conversion criterion between the two descrip-
tion frameworks.

Kim  et  al.  [146,147]  used  the  level  set  method  with  a  sub-
grid Lagrangian breakup model to simulate the breakup of a liquid
round jet. Two conversion criteria for drop transfer [146] were pro-
posed as V D ≤ 2 V cv , r max < 2 r
sphere , where V D is the drop volume,
V cv is the grid cell volume, r max is the maximum distance between
sphere  is the ra-
the center of mass and the surface of the drop, r
dius of a corresponding sphere such that 4 / 3 π r 3
= V D . Further-
more, a capillary breakup model [147] was inserted as Lagrangian
drops when pinching-off of ligaments is not resolved on the level
set grid. This method is claimed to be able to conserve the mass as
well as reduce the computational cost. Herrmann [150] proposed

sphericity were used as the conversion criteria. The coupling pro-
cedure mainly consists of three steps as droplet identification, con-
version criteria from Eulerian to Lagrangian representation, and La-
grangian droplet generation and transport. The drop size distribu-
tion was in good agreement with the experimental data although
the reverse transfer from Lagrangian to Eulerian description was
not considered. This coupling method has been further applied to
simulations of swirling jet [182] and crossflow jet [177] .

Tomar et al. [163] performed a multi-scale simulation of pri-
mary  atomization  by  using  the  interface  capturing  method  cou-
pled with a two-way coupling Lagrangian particle tracking model.
A threshold volume was used for the Eulerian-Lagrangian transfor-
mation, and the Lagrangian particles were reversely transformed
to Eulerian description when the particles are less than a grid cell.
The collisions between droplets were predicted by using a spatial-
hashing algorithm. Ling et al. [223] put a focus on the conversion
and  momentum  coupling  between  the  Eulerian  and  Lagrangian
representation. The conversion criteria between Eulerian and La-
grangian representation depend on the droplet volume, aspect ra-
tio, and position. The feature of the momentum coupling lies in
distributing  the  coupling  force  back  to  the  resolved  flow  over  a
length scale of 5–10 times of the droplet diameter. This approach
proves to faithfully recover the large-scale features of gas-assisted
atomization.

Zozio et al. [224] developed an improved multi-scale Eulerian-
Lagrangian  method  for  simulation  of  atomization.  The  sphericity
criterion  was  used  only  for  the  conversion  from  Eulerian  to  La-
grangian representation. The Lagrangian droplets were represented
by two inclusions, i.e ., small inclusion that the droplet size is lesser
than  the  local  grid  size  for  drag-force  model,  and  medium  in-
clusion  that  the  droplet  size  is  greater  than  the  local  grid  size
for  intermediate  treatment.  The  procedure  includes  detection  of
droplets, transformation criteria, tracking, and drop-interface col-
lision.  Numerical  tests  showed  a  good  performance  in  particular
for the meso-scales in which liquid structures can be captured on
a few grid cells. It should be noted that the medium droplets that
hold 1–4 grid cells can not be sufficiently resolved, and also fail

a parallel Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling procedure to simulate the
straight  jet.  A  recursive  algorithm  was  used  to  identify  the  liq-
uid structures. Then a threshold volume as well as an eccentric-
ity measure threshold was used as the conversion criteria, based
on  which  the  transfer  from  the  Eulerian  to  the  Lagrrangian  de-
scription was formulated. The reverse transfer was given by sim-
ply re-evaluating the local level set field due to drop/drop colli-
sion or drop collision with the Eulerian structures. Arienti et al.
[179] used a Lagrangian model for postbreakup tracking of droplets
with  block-structure  AMR  and  the  CLSVOF  method  for  the  im-
pinging jet simulation. Similarly, a threshold volume and the drop

the Lagrangian point assumption. For such dilemma, the treatment
proposed by Ling et al. [223] and Zozio et al. [224] to conserve the
momentum is a better choice.

Significant effort s have been made to develop coupled Eulerian
and Lagrangian methods for integrated simulations of atomization.
The focus has moved from one-way coupling in early studies to
two-way  coupling  in  recent  studies.  Numerical  results  seem  to
faithfully recover the overall characteristics of atomization. How-
ever, the details of the conversion and the consistency of position,
mass, and momentum need further investigation. The conversion
criteria have several types that should be unified. The post-transfer
velocity field will be changed and the drop dynamics or the drag
induced gaseous flow has been simplified. These issues require fur-
ther attention.

4.4. Interface with evaporation

Interfaces  with  evaporation  are  always  encountered  in  dense
spray  zone  and  deformable  droplets,  but  it  is  difficult  to  model
the evaporation process with these irregular interfaces. With the
level set method, it is feasible to directly simulate interfaces with
evaporation, as introduced in Section 3 . Here we only focus on the
phenomena  of  liquid  structures  with  evaporation  or  droplet  im-
pact on hot surfaces. Under the latter condition, a thin vapour layer
may generate between the droplet and the surface, causing the so-
called Leidenfrost effect [225] .

Early  studies  on  the  interface-resolved  droplet  with  evapora-
tion are dependent on empirical models. With the help of vapor
flow model and heat transfer model, Ge and Fan performed sim-
ulations of liquid droplet impact on a flat surface [226,227] and
droplet-particle  collision  [228,229]  in  the  Leidenfrost  regime  by
using the level set method. In these studies, the droplet dynam-
ics and droplet-vapor-surface/particle heat transfer have been ana-
lyzed with different im pact Weber numbers. Some interesting re-
sults have been obtained, for example, the subcooled impact yields
a thinner vapor layer and a higher heat transfer rate compared to
the saturated impacts.

Later, without empirical models, Gibou et al. [133] proposed a
level set method for multiphase flow with phase change. The evap-
orative  mass  transfer  was  calculated  at  per  unit  droplet  surface
area. The temperature on the interface was assumed to be satu-
rated and the energy equation was solved in both phases. The mass
transfer and heat transfer were calculated by considering the jump
conditions across the interface. Two-dimensional evaporation of a
drop was simulated to validate the method. Chatzikyriakou et al.
[230] also performed a simulation of droplet-hot wall interaction
without empirical models. Evaporative mass transfer was approxi-
mated by specifying a uniform mass transfer rate and the energy
equation was not solved. The droplet rebounding phenomenon was
simulated  in  two  dimensions  and  good  agreement  with  experi-
mental observation was observed.

By using the level set method, Son and coworkers conducted
simulations of microdroplet evaporation on a heated surface [143] ,
the  Marangoni  effect  [231] ,  the  particle  motion  [232]  and  the
particle-laden droplet evaporation with the Marangoni effect [233] .
A dynamic contact angle model was incorporated into the method
to consider the change at the liquid-gas-solid interline. Both the
temperature and mass fractions were considered in the method. It
was found that the droplet life depends strongly on the wall tem-
perature. The Marangoni effect increases the liquid velocity inside
the droplet and the gas velocity along the surface. The particle ac-
cumulation near the contact line is consistent with the experimen-
tal observation. Tanguy et al. [119] proposed a level set method for
evaporating two-phase flows. A local evaporation mass flow rate
per  unit  of  surface  area  was  defined  and  the  GFM  was  used  to
handle jump conditions for heat and mass transfers. A projection

method was set up to impose a divergence-free condition. The d 2
law was reproduced through simulation of a static drop evapora-
tion.  Simulation  of  a  water  droplet  moving  in  air  was  also  per-
formed and the temperature inside the droplet is shown in Fig. 21 .
It was observed that a vortex due to the viscosity jump between
the liquid and gas phases can lead to non-uniform spatial temper-
ature distribution inside the drop. This also implies that the impor-
tance of defining the local evaporation rate per unit of the surface
area.

The droplet is usually considered to be at saturated condition
in early studies. However, the distinction between evaporation and
boiling is not always possible in some specific situations involving
heterogeneous thermodynamic conditions on the interface. Thus,
the interface temperature can locally  reach the  boiling tempera-
ture but be cooler in other areas. To overcome this issue, Villegas
et al. [144] proposed a novel numerical method that allows dealing
with both evaporation and boiling on the interface. The feature of
this method lies in imposing Robin boundary condition. Simulation
of an impacting droplet on a hot plate including Leidenfrost effect
was performed and the temperature field in the liquid phase at
different times is presented in Fig. 22 . The transition between the
evaporation regime and boiling regime was clearly visualized, and
the formation of a thin saturation vapor layer was observed be-
tween the hot wall and the interface during the droplet spreading.
Villegas et al. [137] further investigated the droplet impact on a
hot surface for different im pacting Weber numbers ranging from 7
to 45. It was found that the droplet heating increases with the im-
pacting Weber numbers, and the simulation allows for accurate de-
scription of the multi-scale characteristics involving fluid dynamics
and coupled heat and mass transfer.

Duret et al. [221] used a passive scalar to represent the evapo-
ration and mixing process in a two-phase HIT flow with the level
set method to capture the gas-liquid interface. The method was re-
stricted to low evaporation rate in which the interface was barely
affected by the evaporation process. The statistical analysis of the
vapor field was performed and it showed that the beta PDF, fre-
quently used in combustion modeling, is not adequate to repre-
sent the scalar mixing when interface is involved. In addition, the
results  showed  that  the  evaporation  process  does  not  affect  the
spectrum shape of the scalar but change the energy level of the
scalar.

Recently, Fechter et al. [234] proposed an approximate Riemann
solver for compressible flow with phase transition and surface ten-
sion  with the  level set  method for  capturing the  interface.  Sim-
ulation of a shock-droplet interaction was performed and it was
demonstrated that the method can provide a fast and accurate res-
olution of phase transfer effect with much lower costs.

Li  et  al.  [178]  performed  simulation  of  liquid  fuel  atomiza-
tion and evaporation in crossflow with an advanced method. The
CLSVOF method with AMR technique was used to capture the in-
terface,  and the Lagrangian single-particle model was applied to
describe the small-scale droplets. Two-way transition and coupling
between gaseous phase and Lagrangian droplets were considered.
The liquid jet Weber number and Reynolds number were 180 and
3490, respectively. It was found that when the injected liquid is
colder than the crossflow gas, the vapor downstream distribution
is center peaked which is related to the relative sizes and evapo-
ration time of the droplets.

In addition, interface-resolved simulations of relative gas-liquid
with the level set method for capturing the interface have been
developed in the recent years. Shao et al. [142] developed a com-

putational framework for interface-resolved simulation of simulta-
neous atomization, evaporation and combustion, in which interface
is described by using the level set method, discontinuity across the
interface is treated by using the GFM, and one-step global reac-
tion chemistry of n -heptane is used for the vapor combustion. This
method can treat both conditions that the gas temperature is lower
or  higher than the  saturation temperature, and the performance
has been validated by several benchmark simulations. Integrated
simulation of droplet collision and combustion was also carried out
to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the method. Zoby et al.
[235] performed simulations of regularly ordered kerosene droplet
arrays  in  inert  and  reactive  convective  environments  by  using  a
mass conservative level set method. Evaporation rates were com-
pared to two evaporation models based on heat and mass transfer
numbers. It was found that two empirical evaporation models are
of limited success to predict the evaporation rates of dense sprays,
and there is no evident correlation between the evaporation rates
and  the  subgrid  kinetic  energy.  Haruki  et  al.  [236]  investigated
transient  flame  propagation  in  n -decane  droplet  arrays  by  using
the level set method. Three different modes of flame propagation

88

were successfully reproduced as observed in experiment. The flame
propagation speed was accurately predicted, on which the radia-
tive heat transfer had an essential influence. Shinjo and cowork-
ers investigated droplet/turbulence interaction during primary at-
omization [237,238] and fuel droplet puffing and microexplosion
[239,240] . It showed that mixing by turbulent eddies around the
droplets is enhanced more strongly than molecular diffusion, and
group  combustion  is  likely  to  occur.  The  droplet-generated  mix-
ing enhancement effect should be included in the classical point-
source model. For microexplosion/puffing of a water-in-oil emul-
sion droplet, it was found that the temperature field is distorted
by the velocity field, but the Hill’s vortex is not formed because of
the weak distortion. A model was then proposed to reproduce the
temperature field inside the droplet which is a key initial condition
of microexplosion/puffing.

Significant progresses have been obtained for simulations of in-
terface with evaporation by using the level set method in the last
decade. The empirical vapor layer model and heat transfer model
used in early studies were replaced by accurate and direct meth-
ods of considering the jump conditions across the interfaces. With
these more accurate methods, the dynamics and heat/mass trans-
fer inside or around the interfaces could be reproduced, and new
phenomena were observed. However, systematical investigation of
the droplet-turbulence-evaporation-combustion interaction mecha-
nisms is still limited, especially in realistic spray combustion con-
ditions.

5. Summary and outlook

The level set method has achieved a significant success in mul-
tiphase  simulations  over  the  past  twenty  years.  In  this  article,
methodology  development  of  the  level  set  method  and  applica-
tions to detailed numerical simulation of atomization/evaporation
have been reviewed. For methodology development, the state-of-
the-art attempts to improve the mass conservation property of the
level set method can be classified into two categories, namely, im-
provement of the discretization of the level set equation and im-
provement  of  the  re-initialization  process.  The  interface  refined
level set method coupling with the VOF method is believed to be
the most attracting tool for simulations of large-scale atomization
process. New challenges are highlighted when simulating atomiza-
tion with evaporation by using the level set method. The treatment
of three important issues has been discussed including jump con-
ditions across the interface, insurance of divergence-free velocity
field, and unified calculation of evaporation rate. Recently, the ef-
forts of coupling of numerical method for atomization and evap-
oration even reaction have been increasing and it is expected to
be  the  most  accurate  way  to  directly  simulate  the  overall  spray
combustion process. These improvements in methodology provide
a faithful tool to simulate atomization and evaporation.

With regard to the applications of the level set method to sim-
ulations  of  atomization  and  evaporation,  the  focus  is  placed  on
the primary atomization, secondary atomization, and evaporation
on irregular interface. The overall large-scale structures observed
in experiments can be successfully reproduced by using the level
set method. For instance, the subtle phenomena, such as the sheet
formation, ligaments or hole formation from the sheet, and the im-
pact region of droplet impact on a liquid film, can be captured that
are difficult to be observed in experiments. With the help of these
observations,  the  corresponding  mechanisms  related  to  atomiza-
tion and evaporation have been partially identified.

Despite  of  significant  progresses,  several  challenges  and  un-
solved issues still exist in detailed numerical simulation of atom-
ization  and  evaporation  with  the  level  set  method.  The  first  is
related to the fidelity of the smaller droplet in large-scale simu-
lations of atomization. On one hand, the droplets especially those

smaller than the Kolmogorov scale are not fully resolved in most
current simulations of atomization. One should admit it that re-
solving the smallest droplet in realistic atomization is unfeasible
for the present interface capturing or tracking methods owing to
huge computational cost. Hence the primary work we can do is to
assess the influence of the smaller droplets on the overall large-
scale structures. On the other hand, the current numerical results
of drop size distribution are mostly not grid convergence, which
can provide incorrect information for spray combustion simulation.
The integrated Eulerian–Lagrangian method may be an effective al-
ternative to represent the overall atomization/evaporation process.
Secondly, there is a lack of general understanding of the physi-
cal mechanisms of atomization process especially in realistic spray
combustion conditions. Although various physical mechanisms at
different  regimes  have  been  proposed  by  different  researchers
based on detailed numerical simulations of atomization, some of
them are contrary to each other, even under the same conditions.
The consistency with the development of interfacial instability and
the reason that triggers the atomization by interfacial instability
have not yet been achieved.

Thirdly, more attention should be paid to the improvement of
sub-grid model, atomization model, and droplet/evaporation model
that  are  used  in  the  RANS/LES  context.  On  one  hand,  in  classi-
cal CFD simulations of spray combustion, the accuracy of atomiza-
tion model is very important especially for realistic applications,
but the state-of-the-art atomization models rely heavily on theo-
retical assumptions or empiricism. To this end, the database of at-
omization via interface-resolved DNS can be used to improve the
atomization  model  and  the  subgrid  model  that  are  used  in  the
RANS/LES context. On the other hand, for combustion applications,
the  classical  drag  coefficient  correlation,  single  droplet  dynamic,
single  droplet  evaporation  model,  liquid  film  evaporation  model,
turbulent mixing model and sub-grid models are usually used. It
is expected that these models are different with and without com-
bustion.  There  is  a  need  to  validate  and  improve  these  models
based on the DNS database of atomization with evaporation and
combustion.  Unfortunately,  limited  improvement  has  been  made
along this line in the literature.

Finally, there is a great lack of investigation on spray relevant
issues by using the level set method, such as, the nozzle internal
flow  effect  on  the  atomization  process,  the  electrohydrodynamic
(EHD) atomization, and the coupling with magnetic field. It will be
interesting to investigate those effects in the future.

Appendix A

This  appendix  presents  the  mathematical  formulations  of  the

PDE extrapolation and the FMM extrapolation.

Taking the linear extrapolation as an example, the PDE extrap-
olation extends A in the normal direction by sovling the following
sequent equations to steady state [134] :

n ·∇A corresponds to the directional derivative in the

normal direction,
n  is the unit normal vector pointing to the un-
known subdomain and is a unit Heaviside function. Note that the
Heaviside  function  is  used  simply  to  not  disturb  the  values  in
known  subdomain.  In  particular,  H = 0  in  the  known  subdomain
and H = 1 in the unknown one. A second-order upwind scheme is
employed to discretize the above PDEs. Once Eq. (47) reaches the
→
n ·∇ A n = 0 , indicating that A n is a
steady state, Eq. (48) reduces to
constant in the normal direction. The obtained A n -field appears as
a source term in Eq. (48) . Once Eq. (48) reaches the steady state,
the normal derivative of the finally obtained A equals to A n .

Instead of converging the above PDEs to steady state, the FMM
extrapolation [135] solves the non-homogeneous Hamilton–Jacobi
equations, which are mathematically identical to the steady-state
PDEs, using the FMM. For instance, the corresponding Hamilton–
Jacobi equation of Eq. (48) reads
∇A · ∇φ = A n

McCaslin  et  al.  [135]  found  that  if  second  order  convergence
accuracy  in  a  narrow  band  is  sufficient  for  a  given  application,
then the FMM extrapolation should always be used, as it provides
the  same  accuracy  as  the  PDE  at  a  significantly  reduced  cost.  If
higher rates of convergence is required, a high-order polynomial
PDE method is preferable.

Appendix B

The standard projection method for the incompressible Navier–
Stokes equations consists of the three steps. In particular, an inter-
mediate velocity field at a new time step n + 1 is firstly calculated
by advancing the momentum equation without pressure term,

For  evaporating  two-phase  flows,  the  projection  method  is
solved separately in each phase and the GFM is used to treat the
discontinuities of pressure and velocity.

In [119] , to preserve the divergence-free condition on the inter-
face, a complex improvement of the liquid velocity field extension
has been developed by Tanguy et al. It consists in solving an ad-
ditional  Poisson  equation  for  liquid  velocity  field  in  the  gaseous
domain:

whereas the ghost values of the gas velocity are simply defined by
Eq. (39) .

Appendix C

To  complete  the  HFM  of  evaporation,  one  needs  to  predeter-
mine the interface temperature T (cid:12)
, which can be customarily set
to the equilibrium saturation temperature corresponding to the in-
terface pressure p (cid:12)
. If the thermodynamic equilibrium on the in-
terface  is  applied,  then  T (cid:12)
is  uniquely  determined  through  the
Clapeyron relation
(cid:14)
(cid:12) = T sat
T

(57)

(cid:12)
p

(cid:15)

Eq.  (57)  is  adequate  and  convenient  for  macroscale  boiling
problems  involving  plane  interface.  For  a  more  general  applica-
tion this review concerns, however, the pressure will jump across
the interface due to capillary, viscous and phase change effects as
Eq. (36) addresses. In particular, the equilibrium saturation temper-
atures corresponding to the interface pressure in the gas and liquid
phases are not consistent:
(cid:14)
(cid:9) = T sat

(cid:14)
T sat

That is to say, the local thermodynamic equilibrium implies that
the  interface  temperature  is  continuous  on  the  interface  only  if
the pressure is continuous, and jumps if the pressure jumps. Note
that, the temperature discontinuity cannot be eliminated by rigor-
ous application of first principles [241] . In Shankar and Deshpande
[242] , the temperature distribution in mercury-vapor phase change
between plane liquid surfaces shows jumps across the interface as
large as almost 50% of the applied temperature difference.

The temperature discontinuity lead to a question of what value
should be chosen for T (cid:12)
. Two choices of thermal boundary condi-
tions are possible in the literature such as Huang and Joseph [243] .
The first one assumes temperature should be continuous on the in-
terface
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12) = T
g  = T sat ( p ∞ )
l  = T
T

(59)

) (cid:9) = T (cid:12)

g  (cid:9) = T sat (p (cid:12)

where  p ∞  is  the  reference  ambient  system  pressure.  Although
Eq.  (59)  physically  violates  the  thermodynamic  equilibrium  be-
cause T sat (p (cid:12)
g ) , it allows thermal equilibrium
l
of the two phases. The second one, using the kinetic theory, as-
sumes local thermodynamic equilibrium for both phases, and al-
lows a temperature discontinuity on the interface

The correct choice of the interface temperature boundary condi-
tion is still an unresolved issue. But according to Juric and Tryggva-
son [244] , both approaches lead to the same concept: an interfacial
resistance to mass transfer across the interface. Correspondingly,
they proposed a general procedure to address the thermal inter-
face condition. They began with the principle of balance of entropy

is the kinetic mobility, describing the resistance to mass transfer
across the interface. The interface pressure can be defined as the
average of the interface pressures in the liquid and gas phases. In
[244] ,  they  also  performed a  scale  analysis  to  assess  the  contri-
bution of different effects, i.e . the right hand terms of Eq. (61) . In
respect to problems this review concerns, the interface tempera-
ture deviation is usually weak, and the contribution of these dif-
ferent effects is negligible. When all of the right hand terms are
discarded,  Eq.  (61) reduces  to  the  first approach of  Eq.  (59) .  In-
deed, this simplification proves to be effective in many situations
