## Question 1

### 问题

The supercooling phenomenon of water in the catalyst layer during PEM fuel cell cold start is a critical transport phenomenon. (a) Starting from nucleation theory, derive the critical cluster radius r* for supercooled water droplets as a function of temperature. (b) Using the derived expression, calculate the critical radius at -20°C and analyze why it affects the stochastic behavior of cold start cycle variations.

### 标准答案

The critical cluster radius r* for supercooled water droplets can be derived from classical nucleation theory. The Gibbs free energy change for forming a spherical ice cluster of radius r is ΔG = 4πr²σ_cl - (4πr³)/(3)·(ρ·h_f·ΔT)/T_e, where σ_cl is the interfacial energy between cluster and water, ρ is density, h_f is latent heat, ΔT is supercooling, and T_e is melting temperature. Differentiating d(ΔG)/dr = 0 gives the critical radius: r* = -2σ_cl·T_e/(ρ·h_f·ΔT). At -20°C, with typical values σ_cl = 25 mJ/m², ρ = 1000 kg/m³, h_f = 333 kJ/kg, T_e = 273 K, ΔT = 20 K, σ_cl ≈ 0.025 J/m², the calculation yields r* ≈ 1.8 nm. This small critical radius means that nucleation can be easily triggered by random defects or ice fragments, explaining the stochastic cycle variations. When the water droplet grows larger than r*, it suddenly freezes, causing rapid voltage failure. The stochasticity arises because seeds like fiber defects or cracks are randomly distributed. Thus, the presence of supercooled water and its transition to ice is probabilistic, leading to different cold start durations in repeated cycles under identical macroscopic conditions.
