## Question 1

### 问题

In electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis under mild conditions, explain how the scaling relations and BEP relations are used to theoretically screen transition metal catalysts, specifically discussing their implications for nitrogen adsorption and activation energies.

### 标准答案

The scaling relations and Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations are fundamental tools in theoretical catalyst screening for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis (EAS). Scaling relations describe approximate correlations between adsorption energies of intermediates (e.g., *NHx) on catalyst surfaces, allowing prediction of catalytic activity trends across different metals. For instance, the adsorption energy of *NH scales linearly with *NH2 across transition metals (TMs), enabling construction of volcano plots to identify optimal catalysts. The BEP relation empirically links activation energy (Ea) to reaction energy (ΔE) for elementary steps; in EAS, Ea for N2 dissociation correlates with N adsorption energy (EN). Together, these relations simplify DFT calculations by reducing the need to compute all transition states. For example, early TMs like V and Mo exhibit strong N2 adsorption but high EN, making N2 activation facile but subsequent hydrogenation challenging. Conversely, late TMs like Ru balance EN and hydrogenation barriers, positioning them near volcano peaks. These insights guide experimental designs, such as doping or alloying to tune EN and break scaling relations for improved activity.

## Question 2

### 问题

Derive the Faradaic efficiency (FE) expression for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis (EAS) and analyze how competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) impacts FE, using the current densities for both reactions.

### 标准答案

Faradaic efficiency (FE) for EAS is defined as the fraction of total electrons used for NH3 production versus total electrons consumed. For EAS (N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3), the NH3 production rate (r_NH3) relates to current density (j_NH3) via r_NH3 = j_NH3/(6F), where F is Faraday's constant. HER (2H+ + 2e− → H2) contributes current density j_HER. Total current density j_total = j_NH3 + j_HER. Thus, FE = (j_NH3/j_total) × 100%. Competing HER reduces FE because j_HER often dominates due to its lower kinetic barrier (2e− vs. 6e− for EAS). For instance, if j_NH3 = 1 mA/cm² and j_HER = 9 mA/cm², FE = 10%. To improve FE, strategies include: (1) suppressing HER via proton-limiting conditions (e.g., high pH), (2) designing catalysts with high N2 adsorption (*N2) but weak H adsorption (*H), and (3) tuning d-band centers to stabilize *N2H intermediates. Theoretical calculations predict FE by comparing limiting potentials (UL) for EAS and HER; a small ΔUL = UL(EAS) − UL(HER) indicates poor selectivity.

## Question 3

### 问题

Compare the dissociative and associative pathways for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction on transition metal surfaces, highlighting the role of temperature and catalyst structure in determining the dominant pathway.

### 标准答案

The dissociative pathway involves N2 dissociation into adsorbed N atoms (*N) before hydrogenation, prevalent in Haber-Bosch processes at high temperatures (>300°C) due to high N≡N bond energy (941 kJ/mol). On Fe(100), N2 dissociation has Ea ~21 kJ/mol but requires elevated temperatures to overcome entropy barriers (Sa ~350 J/mol·K). In contrast, associative pathways dominate under mild conditions (<100°C): (1) Alternating pathway: H adds alternately to both N atoms of *N2, releasing NH3 in final steps; (2) Distal pathway: H adds to terminal N first, releasing one NH3 early. Catalyst structure dictates pathway preference: Flat surfaces (e.g., Ru(0001)) favor dissociative paths, while stepped surfaces or single-atom catalysts (SACs) stabilize *N2 for associative routes. For example, Mo SACs on BN nanosheets follow an enzymatic associative path with ΔGmax = 0.22 eV due to side-on *N2 binding, elongating N≡N bonds (1.20 Å vs. 1.10 Å in gas phase). Temperature affects pathway dominance by altering *N2 coverage; low temperatures favor molecular adsorption (γ-N2, α-N2) over dissociation.

## Question 4

### 问题

Analyze the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism in transition metal nitrides (TMNs) for EAS, including the role of nitrogen vacancies (NVs) and the regeneration of active sites.

### 标准答案

The MvK mechanism in TMNs involves cyclic reduction of lattice N atoms and N2 replenishment at vacancies: (1) Surface N atoms are electro-reduced to NH3, creating NVs; (2) N2 adsorbs at NVs, weakening N≡N bonds via electron donation from TM d-orbitals; (3) N2 dissociates to refill NVs. DFT studies show early TMNs (e.g., VN, CrN) excel due to optimal NV formation energies (EV) and N2 adsorption strengths. For VN, EV ≈ 1.5 eV ensures stability, while N2 adsorption energy (EN2) ≈ −0.5 eV balances activation and regeneration. The catalytic cycle is: VN → VN1−x + xNH3 → VN1−x + N2 → VN. Challenges include NV poisoning by O2−/OH−; e.g., RuN is inactive due to H+ blocking NVs. Experimental validation comes from 15N2 isotopic labeling, where 14NH3/15NH3 mixtures confirm NV participation. Compared to associative pathways, MvK avoids *H competition, achieving higher FE (e.g., 13.9% on NbSe2). However, NV sintering at high overpotentials deactivates TMNs, necessitating defect engineering.

## Question 5

### 问题

Calculate the theoretical limiting potential (UL) for EAS on a Mo single-atom catalyst (SAC) anchored on N-doped graphene, given the free energy changes (ΔG) for each proton-electron transfer step, and compare it to HER.

### 标准答案

For Mo SAC on N-doped graphene, the associative enzymatic pathway free energies (ΔG in eV) are: *N2 → *N2H (0.22), *N2H → *N2H2 (−0.15), *N2H2 → *N2H3 (0.33), *N2H3 → *NHNH2 (0.12), *NHNH2 → *NH2NH2 (−0.25), *NH2NH2 → 2NH3 (0.18). The potential-determining step (PDS) is *N2 → *N2H with ΔGmax = 0.22 eV. UL(EAS) = −ΔGmax/e = −0.22 V vs. RHE. For HER, ΔG*H = −0.05 eV on Mo SAC, giving UL(HER) = −ΔG*H/e = 0.05 V. The thermodynamic overpotential η = UL(EAS) − UL(HER) = −0.27 V, indicating HER is favored. To improve selectivity, strategies include: (1) Increasing ΔG*H via electron-withdrawing ligands (e.g., B doping raises ΔG*H to 0.34 eV); (2) Enhancing *N2 binding through charge polarization (e.g., C neighbors donate electrons to Mo). Experimentally, Mo SACs achieve FE ~14.6% at −0.3 V, validating theoretical predictions. The small ΔUL highlights the need for precise catalyst design to suppress HER.
