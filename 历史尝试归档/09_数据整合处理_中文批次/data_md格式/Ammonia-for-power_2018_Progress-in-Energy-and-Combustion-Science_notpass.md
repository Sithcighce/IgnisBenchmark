## Question 1

### 问题

Analyze the NOx formation pathways in ammonia-methane co-fired gas turbine combustors, comparing the contributions of thermal, prompt, and fuel-NOx mechanisms at different equivalence ratios.

### 标准答案

In ammonia-methane co-firing, NOx formation occurs through three dominant pathways: 1) Fuel-NOx (~90% contribution): NH3 oxidation forms NH2 radicals that primarily react via NH2 + O → HNO + H → NO; 2) Thermal-NOx (<5%): Becomes relevant above 1800K via N2 + O ↔ N + NO, but is suppressed by ammonia's lower flame temperatures; 3) Prompt-NOx (~5-10%): Forms through CH + N2 → HCN + N in CH4-rich zones. At lean conditions (φ=0.6-0.9), Fuel-NOx dominates (>80%) due to abundant O radicals oxidizing NHx species. Near stoichiometric (φ=1.0), the reburn mechanism NH + NO → N2 + OH becomes significant, reducing NOx by ~30%. In rich conditions (φ=1.1-1.3), unburned NH3 acts as a reducing agent via NH2 + NO → N2 + H2O, but N2O formation increases through NH + NO → N2O + H. Measurements show peak NOx of ~600ppm at φ=1.0 dropping to ~200ppm at φ=1.2.

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> At these low temperatures, NH3 oxidation occurred in a premixed reaction zone, as sufficiently high temperatures led to the development of a non-premixed reaction zone that produces significantly less NO than the equivalent premixed system

**引用 2**:
> Both simulations and experiments showed that adding NH3 to CH4-air mixtures resulted in an increase in NOx concentration, especially at stoichiometric conditions

**领域聚焦分析**: 问题涉及燃烧化学中的NOx形成机理、气体涡轮燃烧室特性及当量比影响，需要燃烧学/能源工程领域的专业知识

**答案问题**: factual_error, unsupported

**改进建议**: 答案需修正：1) Fuel-NOx贡献率90%与原文'especially at stoichiometric conditions'矛盾；2) 缺乏对'non-premixed reaction zone produces significantly less NO'现象的讨论；3) N2O形成路径需引用原文支持
