## Question 1

### 问题

Reactive chemicals exhibit autocatalytic (AC) and thermal decomposition (TD) type reactions. Explain the fundamental differences in reaction pathways between these two types with reference to their heat flow profiles observed in isothermal calorimetry experiments.

### 标准答案

The fundamental difference lies in the reaction mechanisms and heat release characteristics. For TD type reactions (n-th order), the reaction rate depends solely on temperature through Arrhenius kinetics. In isothermal conditions, heat flow immediately peaks at reaction onset then decays exponentially as reactants deplete (dα/dt = k(T)f(α)). Conversely, AC type reactions involve intermediate free radical generation that accelerates decomposition. Initially, radical generation and consumption balance creates an induction period with gradual heat flow increase until maximum rate is reached when autocatalyst accumulation dominates. This produces characteristic sigmoidal heat flow profiles. The heat flow dynamics reflect the underlying chemistry: TD types follow simple unimolecular decomposition (e.g., many nitro compounds), while AC types involve complex chain-branching (e.g., organic peroxides). Experimental differentiation is crucial as AC substances often exhibit lower onset temperatures and sudden runaway behavior.

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> A TD type reaction is basically accelerated by temperature increase and the reaction rate depends only upon temperature through an n-th order rate law, that is, at a certain temperature the heat flow leaps to the maximum at the beginning and then declines exponentially

**引用 2**:
> If, at the initial stage, some intermediate free radicals are generated and in turn trigger self-acceleration decomposition, the reaction scheme represents the mechanism of AC type. The generation and consumption of free radicals simultaneously occur in the initial decomposition stage (i.e. induction period), leading to the gradual increase of both reaction rate and heat flow until they reach the climax.

## Question 2

### 问题

Derive the analytical expression for Time-to-Maximum-Rate (TMR_ad) under adiabatic conditions starting from the energy balance equation for an exothermic reaction in a batch reactor. Explain each term's physical significance.

### 标准答案

Starting with the energy balance for a batch reactor: M_sC_pdT_s/dt = M_s(-ΔH_r)dα/dt - US(T_s - T_env). Under adiabatic conditions (U=0) with thermal equilibrium between sample and cell (T_s = T_c), this simplifies to: dT/dt = (ΔH/C_p)dα/dt. Substituting the Arrhenius rate law dα/dt = Aexp(-E_a/RT)f(α) and assuming first-order kinetics (f(α)=1-α), we obtain dT/dt = (ΔH/C_p)Aexp(-E_a/RT). At TMR_ad, the temperature rise rate reaches maximum when d(dT/dt)/dT = 0. Differentiating gives: (E_a/RT^2)(ΔH/C_p)Aexp(-E_a/RT) = 0 → TMR_ad ≈ RT_0^2/((dT/dt)_0E_a). Key terms: ΔH represents reaction enthalpy driving self-heating, C_p is heat capacity buffering temperature rise, E_a is activation energy controlling temperature sensitivity, and A is pre-exponential factor indicating collision frequency. This formulation assumes negligible reactant consumption during acceleration period.

## Question 3

### 问题

Compare the Semenov and Frank-Kamenetskii thermal explosion models in terms of their assumptions about temperature distribution and applicability to different reactive chemical storage scenarios.

### 标准答案

The Semenov model assumes uniform temperature (lumped system) by considering perfect mixing/stirring, applicable to well-mixed liquids or small particles where Biot number <0.1. It solves dT/dt = (ΔH/C_p)r_q - (US/MC_p)(T-T_env). The Frank-Kamenetskii model accounts for spatial temperature gradients (distributed system) via ∇²T + (Q/λ)exp(-E_a/RT) = 0, crucial for solids/large containers where Biot >0.1. Semenov's critical condition depends on heat transfer coefficient (U), while F-K's depends on thermal conductivity (λ) and characteristic dimension (L). Semenov applies to stirred reactors or fine powders, whereas F-K better predicts ignition in bulk solids like coal piles or large chemical containers. Both models neglect reactant consumption but F-K captures hotspot formation critical for spontaneous ignition.

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> In Semenov model, temperature rise rate in a reaction system is uniform. To satisfy this assumption, the liquid samples must be well stirred or the air around the container must be well circulated, to avoid any temperature gradient between reacting mass inside and outside of the system.

**引用 2**:
> For system with temperature gradient, a Frank-Kamenetskii model with Eq. (24) was proposed instead to describe the heat balance, (cid:8) ∂T ∂t − E a ∂t R T ∂t f ( α)

## Question 4

### 问题

Analyze how the thermal hazard assessment approach differs between organic peroxides and ammonium nitrate (AN), considering their distinct decomposition mechanisms and regulatory classifications.

### 标准答案

Organic peroxides (OPs) exhibit AC-type decomposition via weak O-O bond cleavage (E_a~150-200 kJ/mol), requiring assessment of autocatalytic induction times and sudden runaway risks. UN GHS classifies OPs into Types A-G based on detonation sensitivity (Table 4). AN shows complex 3-stage hazards: 1) endothermic melting (169°C), 2) slow decomposition (200-260°C), and 3) explosive decomposition (>300°C). Its UN classification varies by form (Table 3): Division 5.1 oxidizer for pure AN, Class 1 explosives when contaminated. OPs require extensive incompatibility testing due to catalyst sensitivity (acids/metals), while AN hazards depend on confinement and contaminants (chlorides, organics). AN's large-scale SADT testing must account for phase changes, whereas OP assessments focus on kinetic parameters from μ-calorimetry. Both demand multi-parameter risk indices but with different dominant hazards (gas pressure for OPs vs. oxidizer-enhanced combustion for AN).

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> For all OPs, the weak oxygen-oxygen linkage characterizes their thermal reactivity and spontaneous decomposition tendency. By splitting the peroxide bonds, OPs can decompose and burn vigorously, releasing a large amount of heat, toxic and/or flammable gases or vapors

**引用 2**:
> AN is not combustible at normal temperature and pressure, and thus is normally regarded as an oxidizer according to the strong oxidability. However, the reactivity of AN is very complex. According to Marlair and Kordek [33] , there was a threefold-hazard of AN, the fire related hazards, hazards related to thermal decomposition and explosion hazards.
