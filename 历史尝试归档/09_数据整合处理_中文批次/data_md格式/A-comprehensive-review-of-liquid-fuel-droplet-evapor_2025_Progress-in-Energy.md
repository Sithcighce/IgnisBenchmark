## Question 1

### 问题

Explain the mechanisms by which carbon nanoparticles enhance thermal conductivity in liquid fuel droplets during combustion, and derive an analytical expression for effective thermal conductivity considering nanoparticle aggregation effects.

### 标准答案

Carbon nanoparticles enhance thermal conductivity through multiple mechanisms: (1) Nanoscale layering where interfacial layers between nanoparticles and base fuel exhibit higher thermal conductivity than bulk fluid (γ = Knanolayer/Knp). (2) Brownian motion-induced microconvection where particle motion enhances heat transfer (Dp = kBT/6πηr). (3) Aggregation forming conductive networks with effective radius aag and conductivity Kag. The Wang et al. model accounts for aggregation effects: Keff = Kbf·[(1-fv+3fv∫(Kclacl/(Kclacl+2Kbf)f(acl)dacl)/(1-fv+3fv∫(Kbff(acl)/(Kclacl+2Kbf)dacl))]. Here Kcl represents aggregate cluster conductivity following Bruggeman model, f(acl) is radius distribution function, and fv is volume fraction. The aggregation time scale τagg must be compared to droplet lifetime τd via CR = τparticle/τd = (Lm²/2Dp)/τd where Lm is interparticle distance.

## Question 2

### 问题

Analyze how Peclet number (Pe) and particle migration time scale influence aggregate morphology in evaporating CNF droplets, and discuss experimental observations supporting this relationship.

### 标准答案

The Peclet number Pe = K/8Dp (where K is evaporation rate, Dp is particle diffusivity) determines aggregate morphology: When Pe ≪ 1 (slow evaporation), particles redistribute forming dense spherical aggregates. When Pe ≫ 1 (fast evaporation), particles accumulate near droplet surface forming hollow aggregates. Experimental studies show: (1) At Pe~10 (GrNPL/n-decane, 4% w/w), SEM reveals surface-localized aggregates reducing effective evaporation area by 12.6%. (2) Jet-A/GNP CNFs at 120°C show Pe~1 leads to uniform aggregates enhancing thermal conductivity by 58.8%. The migration time scale τparticle = Lm²/2Dp (~0.6ms for 4% GrNPL) versus evaporation time τd (~100ms) gives CR = τparticle/τd < 1 indicating dominant aggregation effects. This is confirmed by decreasing evaporation area ratio σ = Ae/At from 1 to 0.7 during evaporation.

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> If Pe ≪ 1, particles have ample time to diffuse and redistribute within the droplet, resulting in a densely packed spherical aggregate. Conversely, If Pe ≫ 1, particles accumulate near the droplet surface and are unable to diffuse and redistribute, forming hollow spherical aggregates.

**引用 2**:
> The Pe number describes a similar effect as CR, although the Pe number allows the straightforward use of the burning rate or evaporation rate from the experiments and can illustrate the effects of instantaneous burning rate or evaporation rate to identify in which stage of the combustion process aggregation occurs more frequently.

## Question 3

### 问题

Derive the modified d²-law for CNF droplet combustion incorporating radiation absorption effects, and explain how nanoparticle type affects the absorption coefficient.

### 标准答案

The modified d²-law with radiation absorption is: d(ds²)/dt = -Kc = -[8λg/(Cp,gρl)]ln(1+B) + ∫αλIλdV where αλ is wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient (αλ = πQabsnp/λ) and Iλ is radiative intensity. For MWCNTs: αλMWCNT ≈ 3000 cm⁻¹ at λ=2.7μm (CO2 band) due to high aspect ratio (L/D~1000) and graphitic structure. For GNPs: αλGNP ≈ 500 cm⁻¹ at same λ due to planar confinement. Experimentally, MWCNT/ethanol shows 58% higher Ke than GNP/ethanol at 1.5% w/w due to higher αλ. Monte Carlo simulations show radiation penetration depth δ = 1/αλ decreases from 200μm (base fuel) to 50μm (3% MWCNT), localizing heat near droplet surface. The Spalding number B must be modified to include radiative heat flux: Brad = Bconv + Cp,g(Tflame-Tsurf)/hfg·(αλIλδ/Qconv).

## Question 4

### 问题

Explain the competing mechanisms that determine ignition delay (ID) in CNF droplets, including the roles of thermal conductivity enhancement versus particle aggregation.

### 标准答案

Ignition delay in CNFs is governed by competing mechanisms: (1) Thermal conductivity enhancement reduces ID by accelerating heat transfer (Fourier's law: q'' = -Keff∇T). For 0.1% w/w MWCNT, Keff increases by 35%, decreasing ID by ~20%. (2) Particle aggregation increases ID when CR = τparticle/τd < 1 (fast aggregation). At 1% w/w, aggregates form conductive shells (Kag ~50 W/mK) that insulate droplets, increasing ID by 15%. Experimental data shows: - GrNP/ethanol: ID decreases from 100ms (0%) to 80ms (0.1%), then rises to 95ms (1%) - CB/diesel: Minimum ID occurs at 0.3% w/w The crossover occurs when aggregation-induced surface coverage φagg exceeds percolation threshold φc ≈ 0.16. The modified Semenov criterion gives: ID ~ ρCpR²/[3(Keff(1-φagg) + Kagφagg)]·ln[(Tign-T∞)/(Tign-Tboil)]

## Question 5

### 问题

Analyze the micro-explosion phenomenon in multicomponent CNF droplets, including nucleation criteria and the effect of nanoparticle type on explosion intensity.

### 标准答案

Micro-explosion occurs when volatile components (e.g., light hydrocarbons in diesel) superheat beyond nucleation threshold: ΔTsup = Tsat(Pint) - Tbulk > 2σ/(rnpρghfg) where rnp is nanoparticle radius (~50nm for CNTs). Carbon nanoparticles act as nucleation sites: (1) MWCNTs (high aspect ratio) create elongated vapor channels, yielding intense explosions (droplet fragmentation >50%). (2) GNPs form planar interfaces, producing moderate puffing (~20% mass loss). (3) CNPs induce weak explosions (<10%) due to spherical symmetry. The explosion intensity Γ = Δm/m0 correlates with Ohnesorge number Oh = μ/(ρσR)^0.5: - Jet-A/MWCNT: Oh~0.01, Γ~0.6 - Diesel/GNP: Oh~0.03, Γ~0.3 The thermal Marangoni number MaT = (dσ/dT)RΔT/(μα) >100 indicates bubble coalescence precedes explosion. High-speed imaging shows explosion delay τexp ~10ms correlates with Fourier number Fo = ατexp/R²~0.1.
