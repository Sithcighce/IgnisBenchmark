In considering ammonia (NH3) as a carbon-free fuel for large-scale power generation, this review examines the
current state of knowledge of NH3 as a fuel in terms of its thermophysical properties and burning characteristics
compared to conventional hydrocarbon fuels. The proceeding analysis portrays the challenges associated with
NH3  combustion  in  traditional  systems  and  suggests  fluidised-bed  NH3  combustion  as  a  plausible  means  to
provide reliable ignition, stable combustion, and reduced NOx emission. A fixed-bed is considered as a research
tool, as well as a special case of fluidised-bed, to study NH3 oxidation and combustion in the presence of solid bed
material  to  provide  foundational  information  key  to  understanding  the  more  complicated  fluidised-bed  NH3
combustion. The thermophysical properties and burning characteristics of NH3, along with an examination of the
combustion of other fuels in the presence of solid media, enable expectations for NH3 combustion in fixed- and
fluidised-beds. A general fluidised-bed NH3  combustion system design, along with suggested operating condi-
tions, is presented to provide an appreciation for a practical large-scale fluidised-bed NH3 fired power generation
system. The NH3  combustion chemistry and associated NOx formation and destruction pathways are also dis-
cussed to appreciate the impact of operating conditions on combustion performance. Finally, the review iden-
tifies key knowledge gaps and technical challenges which warrant further research to advance fluidised-bed NH3
combustion technology for large-scale electric power generation in a carbon constrained future.

1. Introduction

Growing  interests  in  renewable  and  environmentally  sustainable
energy infrastructure come with an increasing desire to combat climate
change which is believed by some to be primarily attributed to the CO2-
emitting  combustion  of  fossil  fuels.  Ammonia  (NH3)  has  received
increasing  attention  as  a  carbon-free  renewable  fuel  which,  on  com-
bustion,  emits  no  carbon  oxides  (CO,  CO2),  sulphur  oxides  (SOX),  or
particulate matter (PM) pollution. Ammonia can be produced renewably
and may be either used as a hydrogen carrier or serve as a standalone
fuel for combustion and subsequent power generation [1,2]. An indus-
trial NH3  synthesis plant typically consists of 2 stages: hydrogen gen-
eration  and  NH3  production.  Hydrogen  generation  currently  occurs
predominantly via steam reforming of natural gas or steam gasification
of coal followed by water-gas shift reaction and CO2 removal [3]. Sub-
sequent NH3 production proceeds according to the Haber-Bosch process,
developed during the early 20th century, with the combination of ni-
trogen and hydrogen at ~720 K and ~200 bar on an iron-based catalyst
according to Reaction 1 below [3â7].

If the hydrogen is produced from renewable sources (e.g. solar, tidal,
hydroelectric or  wind, coupled  with water electrolysis),  however, the
use  of  NH3  in  transport,  manufacturing,  or  power  generation  would
provide  an  option  to  substantially  reduce  carbon  emissions  [8â10].
Ammonia  is  within  the  top  ten  globally  manufactured  and  traded  in-
dustrial  chemicals,  with  ~85  %  being  used  as  a  fertiliser  and  the
remaining ~15 % spread across several industries including explosives,
polymer  production,  refrigeration,  and  NOx  emission  control  [3,9,
11â15].  Its  well-established  production  technology,  coupled  with  its
strong  existing  distribution  infrastructure,  thus  makes  a  robust  argu-
ment for potential use of NH3 as a fuel in the energy sector [3,9,11â14].
Relative  to  conventional  hydrocarbon  fuels,  however,  NH3  faces
several challenges when used in current combustion systems, including
elevated  autoignition  temperature,  large  ignition  energy,  high  lower
flammability limit (LFL), slow flame propagation speed, and potentially
high nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission [3â7]. This suggests a multitude of
knowledge gaps in using NH3  as a fuel, particularly in relation to the
effect  of  operating  conditions  on  combustion  and  flame  stability,
burning rate, heat release intensity, and NOx formation and emission.
NOx emission  has been a major counterargument  of NH3  combustion
opponents as it is toxic to life, causes acid rain and urban haze, and can
act as a greenhouse gas [16]. Research and development on NOx for-
mation  and  emission  control  from  conventional  combustion  systems
have been widely carried out by the academia and industry for well over

half a century, with enormous success achieved in relation to the sta-
tionary power generation industry since the 1990s [17â22]. Selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR)
are mature technologies typically used in the post-combustion treatment
of fossil fuels to minimise NOx emission. Since SCR and SNCR generally
employ NH3  or urea as the reductant, the principles of these technolo-
gies  can  be  used  to  form  expectations  and  provide  reasoning  of  NOx
behaviour during fixed- and fluidised-bed combustion of NH3 [23â33].
The  authors  advocate  fluidised-bed  combustion  technology  as  a
means to overcome the challenges arising from the aforementioned poor
combustion characteristics of NH3. The hot bed material in the fluidised-
bed  acts as  a  huge  heat reservoir  which  ensures reliable  ignition  and
stable  combustion  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  Additionally,  the
effective heat and mass transfer environment yields high burning rates
and thus higher volumetric heat release rates.

A fixed-bed reactor may be considered a special case of fluidised-bed
where the reduced gas flowrate yields a  lower upflow  velocity in the
reactor,  thereby  allowing  the  bed  particles  to  settle  into  resting  posi-
tions. This is particularly relevant for industrial scale power generation
applications  where,  in  the  case  of  low  load  operation,  the  flowrate
through  the  reactor  can  be  decreased  and  thus  the  influence  of  bed
material on NH3 combustion in a fixed-bed system becomes of interest. A

fixed-bed reactor, more fundamentally, functions as a research tool to
study reaction behaviour in the presence of solid bed material. This will
provide foundational information to aid in the development of an in-
depth  understanding  of  fluidised-bed  NH3  combustion  which  exhibits
a more complicated flow and reaction environment.

The present contribution articulates and analyses the concept of NH3
combustion  in  fixed-bed  and  fluidised-bed  reactors  by  drawing  on
knowledge  from  a  range  of  studies  which  consider  combustion  of
gaseous fuels in the presence of a solid bed material. The thermophysical
properties  of  NH3  as  a  fuel  and  its  combustion-related  challenges  are
examined to establish a need for continuing research and development
and to appreciate the benefits of NH3 combustion in a fluidised-bed. The
process fundamentals and technical benefits of a fluidised-bed reactor
system to overcome the difficulties associated with NH3 combustion are
then considered and evaluated. Furthermore, the principles of a fixed-
bed  reactor  fed  with  gaseous  fuels  are  summarised  and  assessed  as  a
laboratory  research  tool  to  appreciate  the  impact  of  bed  material  on
reaction  behaviour  and  to  establish  expectations  of  operation  in  a
fluidised-bed scenario. The influence of bed material on NOx chemistry,
including formation and in-situ destruction, is discussed as a uniquely
important  subject  when  considering  NH3  combustion.  Finally,  knowl-
edge gaps and technical challenges are identified, and R&D needs pro-
posed,  in  order  to  further  advance  the  technology  of  fixed-bed  and
fluidised-bed  NH3  combustion  for  zero-carbon  emission  power
generation.

2. Ammonia as a fuel

When  considering NH3  as  a  fuel, knowledge  of its thermophysical
properties, burning characteristics, and associated emissions, notably all
forms of nitrogen oxides, is essential to appreciate its performance in
practical combustion devices and to assist in the development of suitable
new combustion technology for its utilisation as a carbon-free fuel in
power generation. This Section considers the relevant fuel properties of
NH3 and compares it to other fuels of interest to identify the knowledge
gaps where further scientific research is required.

2.1. Thermophysical properties

Key thermophysical properties that dictate the design and operation
of a combustion system, e.g. burners and furnaces, as well as the storage,
transport, and handling of the fuel, include volumetric and gravimetric
energy densities, autoignition temperature, minimum ignition energy,
flammability limits, flame speed, and high and low heating values. Fig. 1
places  various  fuels  in  their  appropriate  positions  of  volumetric  and
gravimetric energy densities. Ammonia can be stored and transported as
a liquid at 240 K and 1.1 barâ1.5 bar [5,34] under which conditions the

gravimetric and volumetric energy densities are 22.5 MJ/kg and 15.6
MJ/L,  respectively  [16,35].  This  puts  NH3  on  the  low  side  of  the
gravimetric energy density range, yet still in a comparable position to
several other conventional fuels for large-scale electric power genera-
tion, most notably coal. Volumetric energy density, however, is perhaps
of greater importance as it is key in reactor design where it influences
gas  volumetric  flowrates  and  thus  reactor  sizing  required  to  achieve
desired thermal throughputs, as well as in the determination of required
storage  vessel  and  shipping  volumes.  While  carbon-free  fuels  such  as
hydrogen and, to a lesser extent, NH3, have several positive attributes,
they are partly compromised by their typically lower volumetric energy
densities in comparison to traditional fossil fuels and alternative fuels.
Fig. 1 indicates that, of the carbon-free fuels, hydrogen has the lowest
volumetric  energy  density  in  the  gas  phase,  incurring  challenges  in
storage and transport. Ammonia thus presents itself as a more suitable
alternative for it is more easily handled than hydrogen since it does not
face  the  difficulties  and  extreme  costs  associated  with  highly  rated
storage  vessels,  compressors,  and  refrigeration  systems  required  to
transport it as a liquid.

Table  1 summarises  some  key  thermophysical  properties  of  NH3
when considered as a fuel. The high autoignition temperature and high
minimum ignition energy, together with its elevated lower flammability
limit, suggest that NH3  is difficult to ignite and needs to combust at a
high concentration in a flame. The low laminar flame speed signifies that
achieving high throughput and stable combustion may be challenging,
while the noticeable difference between the low and high heating values
would lead to inherently low energy utilisation efficiencies. Implications
of the thermophysical properties of NH3, as well as a comparison of these
properties  with  other fuels,  are  discussed in  the  following  sections to
better appreciate areas where knowledge gaps, scientific questions, and
technical challenges exist and require attention in subsequent research
of NH3 oxidation and combustion in fixed- and fluidised-bed reactors.

2.2. Characteristics of ammonia oxidation

The overall NH3 oxidation reaction may be expressed as Reaction 2

However,  there  are  also  a  multitude  of  elementary  and  side  re-
actions, some of which are of particular interest as they contribute to the
formation  and  destruction  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NO,  NO2).  While  it  is
necessary to provide a detailed analysis of NOx chemistry (Section 5)
due  to  its  environmental  implications,  it  is  important  to  first  broadly
understand  the  oxidation  and  combustion  characteristics  of  NH3.
Nakamura et al. [65] investigated NH3 combustion in air at atmospheric
pressure and observed an initiation temperature of ~1050 K, with re-
action approaching completion at ~1270 K for lean (É¸ < 1), stoichio-
metric (É¸ = 1), and rich (É¸ > 1) equivalence ratios. When compared to
stoichiometric combustion, lean combustion showed lower onset reac-
tion temperatures, complete NH3  consumption at lower temperatures,
and elevated final NO levels [65]. Conversely, combustion under rich
conditions  showed  higher  onset  reaction  temperatures  and  final  NO
levels approaching zero, which is attributed to the reduction of NOx by

unburnt  NH3  [65].  A  kinetic  study  of  NH3  oxidation  in  a  jet  stirred
reactor operating at atmospheric pressure undertaken by Stagni et al.
[66] indicated that, for an NH3 concentration of 500 ppm, onset reaction
temperatures  of  1100  K  and  1025  K  were  prevalent  for  oxygen  con-
centrations of 2 % and 4 %, respectively. Our recent work investigating
NH3 oxidation in a vertical cylindrical quartz reactor, with and without a
packed bed of quartz particles, showed that, for the flow (empty-bed)
reactor  scenario  operating  at  stoichiometric  conditions  with  an  NH3
concentration of 5.3 % V/V in Ar, the reaction began at ~1300 K and was
completed at 1400 K based on N2 (product) formation [67]. Conversely,
the  fixed-bed  reactor  scenario  yielded  an  onset  reaction  temperature
~20 % lower than that of the flow reactor (~1050 K for the fixed-bed
and 1300 K for the flow reactor) at É¸ = 1 with more steady and signif-
icant  NH3  conversion  taking  place between  1050  K  and 1350  K  until
completion at 1400 K [67]. Moreover, NOx concentration was found to
be significantly reduced at lean and stoichiometric equivalence ratios for
the fixed-bed compared to the flow reactor scenario [67]. Although NH3
oxidation  and  combustion  observations  are  highly  dependent  on
experimental  apparatus  and  techniques,  the  aforementioned  reaction
characteristics serve as an indication of reaction behaviour and a basis to
which fixed- and fluidised-bed data can be compared.

A quantification of the unique combustion characteristics of NH3 is
determined  via  a  comparison  with  several  other  fuels  including
hydrogen as a renewable alternative, more traditional fuels including
methane  and  propane,  and  synthetic  fuels  such  as  methanol  and
dimethyl ether (DME). Ignition energy and flame propagation velocity
are considered in detail as critical parameters to understand the chal-
lenges facing the use of NH3  as a fuel in conventional combustion sys-
tems. The unusually high lower flammability limit of NH3 compared to
other fuels has important implications in the design and operation of
burners and combustors. Additionally, the ratio of low heating value to
high  heating  value  is  typically  overlooked  in  the  literature  and  the
present work offers an insight into the implications  of this ratio  with
respect to âuseableâ energy from combustion.

Ammoniaâs  unique  combustion  characteristics  mean  that,  while  it
can  certainly  be  used  in  some  traditional  combustion  devices,  new
technology would need to be developed to more effectively utilise the
energy from this fuel. For example, early work has shown that a fixed-
bed  of  quartz  particles  leads  to  increased  conversion  for  NH3  oxida-
tion at lower temperatures when compared to a flow reactor [67].

2.2.1. Autoignition temperature

Autoignition  temperature  is  the  temperature  at  which  a  fuel-air
mixture will spontaneously ignite without an external ignition source

under a set of prescribed conditions. The practical implication of this
parameter is that it indicates the minimum reactor operating tempera-
ture required to achieve stable combustion under the same conditions. A
comparison  of  autoignition  temperatures  between  NH3  and  several
other fuels of interest is presented in Table 2.

While the autoignition temperatures cited from different sources can
vary  significantly,  often  due  to  the  use  of  alternate  measuring  tech-
niques,  Table  2 nonetheless  provides  a clear  indication of  ammoniaâs
high autoignition temperature. Additionally, autoignition temperatures
decrease  with  increasing  equivalence  ratio  and,  since  industrial  com-
bustion systems typically operate with 10 %â15 % excess air, the values
quoted in Table 2 can thus be expected to be greater in practical ap-
plications [82]. For the fuels considered, however, it is evident that NH3
has the highest autoignition temperature. This implies that choosing or
developing  appropriate  technologies  to  burn  NH3  requires  careful
attention to ensure reliable ignition and stable combustion.

2.2.2.

Ignition energy

Ignition energy is a measure of the energy, usually delivered in the
form of a spark, required to initiate combustion of a fuel-air mixture at
atmospheric  conditions  so  that  self-sustained  flame  propagation  may
proceed  through  the  volume  of  the  mixture  [83].  Minimum  ignition
energy can be noticeably affected by spark duration and spark gap, and
measurements are typically subject to reasonable experimental uncer-
tainty,  suggesting  that  the  comparison  of  different  fuels  documented
herein is best treated qualitatively [83]. Fig. 2 compares the minimum
ignition  energy  data  of  ammonia  [47â49,83],  hydrogen  [84â87],
methane [88â91], propane [87,92â96], and methanol [86,97,98], as a
function of equivalence ratio.

While Fig. 2 is able to provide an approximate comparison of mini-
mum  ignition  energies  between  the  selected  fuels,  there  are  limited
studies offering detailed and reliable minimum ignition energy data for
NH3, suggesting that additional work be carried out to provide greater
confidence in these values. The relationship between minimum ignition
energy  and  equivalence  ratio  of  the  selected  fuels  is  in-keeping  with
established knowledge that lowest minimum ignition energies occur at
approximately  stoichiometric conditions (É¸  = 1). Ammonia  is consid-
erably  more  difficult  to  ignite  than  the  other  fuels  in  Fig.  2 with  its
minimum  ignition  energy  being  >1000  times  greater  than  that  of
hydrogen and >10 times greater than that of methane at É¸ = 1. How-
ever, partially dissociated NH3, compared to pure NH3, has been found
to have significantly reduced minimum ignition energy across a range of

equivalence ratios, which decreases with increasing dissociation (refer
to Fig. 2) [83]. This is attributed to the presence of H2, which has a lower
minimum ignition energy than NH3, leading to a mixture that is easier to
ignite than NH3  alone [83]. Additionally, the low ignition energy and
preferential diffusion effect of H2 reduces the equivalence ratio required
to  achieve  minimum  ignition  energy  for  the  NH3-H2  mixture  [83].
Combustion of partially dissociated NH3 in internal combustion engines
as a means to decarbonise the transport sector has been a subject of our
recent  research  and  is  widely  discussed  elsewhere  [56,99â102].  For
stationary  power  generation  applications,  it  is  anticipated  that  the
challenges  in  reliable  combustion  associated  with  the  high  minimum
ignition  energy  of  pure  NH3  can  be  effectively  addressed  with  the
implementation of a fixed-bed or fluidised-bed reactor where the bed
material is able to provide a heat (energy) source capable of ensuring
ignition.

2.2.3. Flammability limits

Fig. 3 depicts a comparison of the flammability limits of ammonia in
air [36,38,50â55] with those of hydrogen [55,103â107], methane [52,
55,103,108,109], propane [52,55,107,109], methanol [55,78,110], and
DME [52,55,111â114], along with their stoichiometric concentrations
in air. It is strikingly evident that NH3  exhibits an unusually high LFL,
meaning that less air (or more fuel) is required to sustain the reaction for
the  same  thermal  throughput.  This  results  in  a  substantially  reduced
total mass flowrate capability through a combustor compared to other
fuels, thereby adversely impacting convective heat transfer and posing
challenges in fluidised-bed reactor design and operation. The implica-
tions of less dilution by air on NOx formation and emission is unknown
and remains an interesting research question. Fig. 3 also indicates that
the fuel concentration required for combustion at É¸ = 1 is approximately
midway in ammoniaâs flammability range compared to near the LFL for
the other fuels. This demonstrates that NH3 will be able to readily sus-
tain  combustion  under  fuel  lean  conditions  which  is  favourable  for
practical applications in the aim to realise maximum energy efficiencies
and  avoid  unburnt  NH3  exiting  the  reactor.  Furthermore,  it  is  antici-
pated that the fluidised-bed combustion of NH3 will be able to burn the
fuel even more easily over a wider range of operating conditions with a
further expected reduction of the lower flammability limit due to the
excellent heat and mass transfer environment.

2.2.4. Flame speed

Laminar flame speed is the speed at which a flame front will prop-
agate  through  its  unburnt  fuel/air  mixture.  It  is  a  fundamental

characteristic of flame behaviour and a key property to ensure stable
combustion â excessive flame speeds are prone to flame flashback (ex-
plosion), while low flame speeds can result in flame blowout. A com-
parison  of  laminar  flame  speeds  of  ammonia  [56â63],  hydrogen
[115â121], methane [122â131], propane [62,129,132â140], methanol
[141â152], and DME [153â161] is depicted in Fig. 4.

The  data  collected  generally  indicates  a  maximum  NH3  laminar
flame  speed  of  ~7  cm/s  at  É¸  = 1.1.  This  is  much  lower  than  the
maximum  laminar  flame  speed  of  methane  (~38  cm/s  at  É¸  = 1.1),
propane (~40 cm/s at É¸ = 1.1), methanol (~47 cm/s at É¸ = 1.2), or DME
(~45  cm/s at  É¸  = 1.1), and  some 97 %  lower than that of  hydrogen
(~300 cm/s at É¸ = 1.7). The substantially slower laminar flame speed of
NH3  in  comparison to the other fuels means  that it is prone  to flame
blowout and thus indicates the difficulty in achieving stable NH3 com-
bustion with conventional gas burners [49,162,163].

Our  recent  work  on  the  combustion  of  partially  dissociated  NH3
indicated  an  increase  in  laminar  flame  speed  with  increasing  NH3
dissociation across a range of equivalence ratios, as depicted in Fig. 4
[56]. The maximum laminar flame speed for 40 % dissociated NH3  is
~16 cm/s which is more than double that of the ~7 cm/s flame speed of
pure NH3. Partially dissociating NH3  thus presents a more suitable op-
tion  for  use  in  certain  combustion  applications  which  require  a  high
flame speed, such as internal combustion engines, where combustion of
pure NH3  is inefficient [56]. For  large-scale stationary power genera-
tion,  partial  NH3  dissociation  would  be  cumbersome  and  direct  com-
bustion  of  NH3  in  a  fluidised-bed  can  overcome  the  challenges
associated with its low flame speed. In the presence of hot bed material,
stable  combustion  is  more  readily  achieved  and  conventional  flame
propagation becomes less relevant. However, the burning rate, i.e., the
rate of fuel gas being burnt per unit reactor volume, becomes of greater
interest  as  it  dictates  the  rate  of  heat  release  and  the  total  thermal
throughput, which are pertinent to large-scale power generation.

2.2.5. High heating value and low heating value

High  heating  value  (HHV)  is  a  measure  of  the  heat  released  by
burning  a  fuel  when  combustion  products  are  returned  to  standard
conditions, so that any water formed in combustion is assumed to be in
the liquid phase. Low heating value (LHV) is also a measure of the heat
released  by  a  fuel,  however,  the  water  formed  is  kept  in  the  vapour
phase.  LHV  is, therefore, more relevant  to practical applications  as  it
represents the amount of âuseableâ  heat since the latent heat of water
vaporisation  is  difficult  to  utilise  in  conventional  power  generation
systems.  This  suggests  that  for  fuels  containing  high  quantities  of
hydrogen  and  consequently  forming  large  quantities  of  water  upon
combustion, a sizeable discrepancy between their HHV and LHV will be
apparent  and  so  the  LHV/HHV  ratio  will  be  small.  A  comparison  of
HHVs,  LHVs,  and  LHV/HHV  ratios  for  different  fuels  is  presented  in
Table 3. Compared to the other selected fuels, hydrogen and ammonia
have  the  lowest  LHV/HHV  ratios,  thus  indicating  an  inherent  energy
efficiency disadvantage associated with burning these fuels due to the
large quantities of water formed during combustion.

technologies which utilise non-co-fired NH3  as a fuel for power gener-
ation. While the work on NH3 combustion in traditional technologies is
not well documented, there have nonetheless been investigations of NH3
combustion in compression ignition engines [164â170], spark ignition
engines  [64,171â174],  turbines  [16,162,175],  and  furnaces  [16,176,
177], often co-firing with other fuels. Compression ignition engines and
spark ignition engines are more relevant to transport applications, while
turbines and furnaces are more suitable for use in the stationary power
generation industry. An investigation into NH3  combustion in turbines
and furnaces provides an insight into the suitability of NH3  for power
generation via conventional systems and alludes to the need for other
technology to achieve higher combustion efficiencies.

The  intrinsic  nature  of  NH3  combustion,  including  its  high  auto-
ignition temperature, elevated minimum ignition energy, high LFL, low
flame speed, low LHV/HHV, and thus overall poor flame stability, makes
its use as a fuel in conventional technologies difficult as these systems do
not generally offer any improvement to these combustion characteris-
tics. Therefore, research which has been undertaken typically considers
NH3 in combination with other fuels to address some of the challenges
associated  with  pure  NH3  combustion,  rather  than  in  utilising  non-
conventional  technology  or  developing  new  systems  capable  of
burning pure NH3 more effectively.

Gas  turbines  are  generally  suitable  for  applications  which  require
fast  ramp-up  or  cool-down  in  size-constrained  locations.  Prototypes
feature  high  pressure  hot  air  to  be  mixed  with  a  combination  of
ammonia, nitrogen, and hydrogen (to simulate partial NH3 dissociation)
[175]. The addition of hydrogen has been found to not only improve
flame stability and lower combustion temperatures, but also to decrease
NOx emission [16]. If a two-stage combustion system is implemented,
further reduced overall NOx (<10 ppm at outlet) and unburnt gas levels
can be realised [16,162]. Even with partial NH3  dissociation, which is
required to increase burning rate and flame speed, NH3 as a fuel in gas
turbines still exhibits slower kinetics, reduced flame temperatures, and
combustion instability, driving the search for alternate technologies in
which pure NH3 combustion can take place more efficiently [16,162].
Furnace combustion for commercial power generation is an estab-
lished technology, used widely for burning coal and, to a lesser extent,
natural  gas.  Research-scale  coal-fired  burners  have  been  modified  for
ammonia co-firing with coal, methane, or hydrogen, with results indi-
cating a reduction in overall carbon, sulphur, and NOx emissions due to
the injected NH3 acting as both a fuel for heat generation and as a NOx
reductant [16,176,177]. Recent commercial-scale work has been carried
out by JERA, Japanâs largest power generation company, who investi-
gated  co-firing  20  %  NH3  with  coal  on  a  1  GW  unit  at  its  Hekinan
thermal power station [178]. Results indicate that sulphur oxide con-
centrations were reduced by 20 %, that NOx was no higher than before
NH3  introduction,  that  N2O  was  below  the  detection  limit,  and  that
similar  operability  was  achieved  when  using  coal  alone  [178].  This
project thus represents a sizeable progression towards the 100 % NH3
fired power plant that JERA are working towards [179]. In some brief
research  which  has  considered  pure  NH3  firing  with  air  staging  in  a
furnace, stable combustion was observed, with NOx emission decreasing
with increasing air staging flowrates (fuel lean conditions) [176]. While
these results are encouraging, a more detailed experimental campaign is
required to critically evaluate pure NH3  combustion in a furnace. The
lack  of  work  on  pure  NH3  combustion  in  both  turbines  and  furnaces
presents  research  opportunities  to  understand  the  suitability  of  NH3
combustion in these technologies, as well as modifications that can be
made  to  these  technologies  which  may  allow  NH3  to  burn  more
efficiently.

For  a  660  MW  power  plant  which  operates  using  an  ultra-
supercritical  Rankine cycle  at  55  % efficiency,  the  fuel  is  required  to
deliver 660/0.55 = 1200 MW = 4,320,000 MJ/h to the system. At a
heating value of 18.6 MJ/kg, the mass flowrate of NH3 to the system is
4,320,000/18.6 = 232 t/h. At this firing rate, it makes NH3 combustion
uneconomical for combustion in internal combustion engines which are

more suitable for small-scale applications, or turbine combustion which
is difficult due to the intrinsic challenges surrounding burning rate and
material selection, while a traditional furnace would be much larger and
thus more costly than a fluidised-bed due to its lower gas heating ca-
pacity.  For  large-scale  power  generation,  therefore,  a  fluidised-bed
emerges as a suitable NH3 combustion technology.

Combustion  of  NH3  in  solid  media  (fixed-  and  fluidised-beds)  is
suggested to be more suitable than NH3 combustion in traditional power
generation combustion technologies, although this has not yet been well
explored.  A  fluidised-bed  reactor  is  suggested  to  overcome  the  chal-
lenges associated with burning NH3  (and mixtures of NH3  with other
fuels) in traditional combustion systems due to its enhanced heat and
mass transfer characteristics, providing guaranteed ignition and stable
combustion [180â183]. Technology facilitating NH3 combustion (in air
or  oxygen  alone)  is  scarce  and  thus  fundamental  research  into  the
oxidation of NH3 in flow and fixed-bed reactor scenarios is first required
to better understand the effect that operating conditions and the pres-
ence  of  a  bed  material  have  on  combustion  characteristics.  It  is  also
suggested that an overall analysis of the principles, benefits, and chal-
lenges  associated  with  design  and  operation  of  NH3-fired  fixed-  and
fluidised-bed  reactors  be  carried  out  to  understand  the  suitability  of
these technologies in power generation applications.

3. Fluidised-bed combustion

Following  the  aforementioned  discussion  on  the  properties  and
combustion characteristics of NH3 (Section 2), fluidised-bed combustion
has  emerged  as  a  technology  capable  of  burning  NH3  for  large-scale
carbon-free stationary power generation applications. This section ex-
amines the relevance, advantages, and potential challenges of fluidised-
bed combustion of NH3  based on the principles of fluidisation and its
aforementioned  combustion  characteristics.  An  analysis  of  the  use  of
fluidised-bed  reactors  in  burning  other  gaseous  fuels  explains  the
improved combustion efficiencies realised using this technology so that
expectations  can  be  applied  to  NH3  combustion  in  a  fluidised-bed
reactor.  Additionally,  a  conceptual  fluidised-bed  NH3  combustion
power plant is presented which indicates how energy from NH3 may be
usefully  extracted  in  large  systems  for  grid-scale  power  generation.
Therefore, the following investigation of fluidised-bed combustion in-
dicates the suitability of NH3  as a fuel for combustion in this type of
reactor and allows for the subsequent identification of relevant scientific
questions  and  technical  challenges  to  provide  direction  for  future
research and development effort.

3.1. Principles of fluidised-bed reactors

A fluidised-bed combustor utilises a bed of solid particles which are
suspended by an upward flowing gas so that the gas-solid mixture ex-
hibits liquid-like properties, hence the term fluidisation [184â186]. This
results in effective mixing which, coupled with the high heat capacity of
the solid particles, leads to excellent heat and mass transfer between the
bed particles, reacting gas, and any other heat transfer surfaces present
[184,185,187,188]. Fluidised-bed reactors are widely used for inciner-
ation (e.g. medical waste [189,190]) or large-scale combustion of poorly
burning solid fuels (e.g. coal gangue in mine-mouth power stations [191,
192]) due to the enormous heat reservoir of the solid bed material [193].
Alternatively, the fluidised-bed reactor can be configured so that the bed
material is a catalyst or inert species which can assist in combustion of
poorly burning gaseous fuels, such as NH3 [194], to generate power with
a steam turbine Rankine cycle [184]. The intense heat and mass transfer
environment,  along  with  its  general  operational  flexibility,  make
fluidised-bed  reactors  inherently  appropriate  for  burning  a  variety  of
(poorly burning) fuels at lower temperatures than what may otherwise
be  expected  in  traditional  combustion  systems  [186,193,195,196].
Although  a  low  operating  temperature  range  of  1000  Kâ1300  K  is
commonly  used  for  waste  incineration  applications,  many  coal-fired

3.2. Fluidised-bed combustion of gaseous fuels

The  combustion  of  gaseous  fuels  in  fluidised-bed  reactors  is  un-
common  compared  to  solid  fuels.  For  a  bubbling  fluidised-bed,  gas
combustion will most probably proceed in bubbles inside the bed rather
than in the emulsion phase [202â206], providing the surrounding bed
material with transient, local overheating as the bubbles explode [205,
207].  Hydrocarbon  combustion  in  a  fluidised-bed  emits  radiation
similar to that from a hydrocarbon flame [205]. Some fuel gas escaping
the  dense  phase  of  the  bed  will  be  burnt  in  the  freeboard  above  the
fluidising bed. In general, combustion gradually moves from the free-
board to just above the distributor with rising bed temperature [203,
205â210], corresponding to an increasing intensity of acoustic effects
associated with exploding bubbles [203,205,207]. As the bed becomes
more fluidised and explosions take place closer to the distributor, the
lower section of the bed operates at a higher temperature than the upper
section [207] and the temperature difference between the freeboard and
bed decreases [203,206]. It is thus not surprising that fuel concentration
decays  exponentially  with  bed  height  and  that  combustion  is  almost
complete before the location of maximum temperature in the bed [210].
Further increasing the bed temperature results in a reduced frequency of
explosions  and  more  continuous  combustion  (in  the  emulsion  phase)
[211].  A  lower  explosion  frequency  results  in  more  safe  and  stable
operation,  whereas  a  high  explosion  frequency  could  lead  to,  for
example,  flame  extinction  [211].  Product  composition  for  operation
during emulsion phase combustion is, however, expected to be highly
dependent on particle size and bed material type [207].

A greater fluidisation gas velocity yields improved NH3  conversion
towards final products [212,213]. This is to be expected as increasing
turbulence results in more effective contact between the bed material
and  the  gaseous  reactants,  albeit  at  the  expense  of  greater  particle
attrition [214]. The greater gas throughput required to maintain more
turbulent  operation  allows  for  higher  power  generation  capabilities
[213]. Systematic research is required to properly determine the impact
of operating parameters on product formation, power generation, and
particle  degradation  in  order  to  definitively  comment  on  the  most
suitable conditions for practical fluidised-bed NH3 combustion.

Fluidised-bed combustion of gaseous fuels has been known to ach-
ieve a reduction in lower flammability limits and faster reaction rates
compared  to  a  premixed  flame  at  the  same  temperature  and  gas
composition  as  a  result  of  either  the  initiation  of  more  gas-phase  re-
actions or the catalytic effect of the bed material [210]. These observed
phenomena  are  attributed  to  the  large  heat  capacity  of  the  solid  bed
material  which  ensures  ignition  and  stable  combustion  across  a  wide
range of conditions, thereby providing a rationale for the adoption of
fluidised-bed  technology  in  burning  fuels  that  typically  exhibit  poor
ignition and combustion characteristics, such as NH3.

It  appears  that  there  is  a  transition  region  which  separates  two
distinct reaction zones during fluidised-bed combustion of gaseous fuels
[203,207]. The transition is more gradual if coarser bed particles are
used and, since larger bed particles have a lower surface to volume ratio
which favours gas-phase reactions and reduces free radical recombina-
tion  on  particle  surfaces,  thereby  suggesting  that  the  transition  is  a
gas-phase effect [207]. Under fuel lean conditions for a fluidised-bed of
quartz sand or CaO, the transition occurs at 1070 Kâ1120 K for natural
gas, 970 Kâ1020 K for LPG, and 990 Kâ1070 K for benzene and m-xylene
[207]. These  transition temperatures are lower than those during py-
rolysis or combustion of natural gas (~1190 K) and propane (~1110 K)
at incipient fluidisation [215]. Temperatures below the transition range
exhibit incomplete combustion and the presence of NO and NO2 (formed
by the oxidation of NO by HO2) [203,206,207]. For temperatures above
the  transition  range,  complete  reactant  conversion  is  observed  which
may be attributed to bubbles being able to explode before their contact
with the surface [203,206,207]. In this case, NOx is formed primarily via
the  âpromptâ  mechanism  [207,212]  and  rises  to  a  maximum  at  the
greatest  intensity  of  bubble  explosions  [207,216].  A  subsequent

dised-bed.

fluidised-bed power stations operate in the vicinity of 1250 Kâ1400 K
[182],  thereby  indicating  that  operating  temperature  is  a  function  of
feedstock, system design, and intended plant performance. This suggests
that fluidised-bed reactors can facilitate in-situ pollution control where
combustion at lower temperatures yields reduced NOx emission. Alter-
natively, SOX emission during the combustion of coal has been found to
be effectively reduced via implementation of limestone in the bed ma-
terial of a fluidised-bed reactor [197â199].

Several  fluidised-bed  reactor  arrangements  exist,  with  varying
effectiveness,  complexity,  cost,  and  operational  flexibility.  The  two
major categories of fluidised-bed combustion used for power generation
are  bubbling  fluidised-bed  and  circulating  fluidised-bed  [186].  Circu-
lating  fluidised-beds  are  widely  adopted  for  the  combustion  of  poor
burning  solid  fuels,  where  the  high  superficial  gas  velocity  yields
maximum heat and mass transfer, and solid particles entrained in the
reactor exit stream are recycled back to the bed using cyclones [186,193,
200]. This technology was particularly popular during the late 1990s
and  early  2000s  where  it  has  been  successfully  implemented  in
large-scale  commercial  power  generation  systems  [193].  A  bubbling
fluidised-bed features lower gas velocities and thus a less violent bed
than in the circulating scenario so that all bed material remains in the
reactor  [186].  In  this  type  of  fluidised-bed,  the  bed  more  effectively
buffers  the  heat  than  in  the  circulating  fluidised-bed  which,  together
with  its  lower  fluidisation  velocities and  thus  higher  residence  times,
makes the bubbling fluidised-bed more suitable for combustion of lower
calorific fuels [180]. The principles of heat transfer in the fluidised-bed
are based upon the pioneering work by Weinberg [201] who proposed
the concept of enthalpy recirculation combustion to minimise pollution
and optimise combustion intensity and efficiency. The different fluid-
isation regimes can, therefore, significantly influence aspects including
heat and mass transfer, completion of combustion, by-product forma-
tion,  thermal  output,  and  bed  material  retention.  Operation  in  the
bubbling regime will be the focus for early-stage NH3 combustion as it is
more  stable,  predictable,  and  less  complex  than  the  circulating
fluidised-bed  scenario,  with  research  output  providing  a  reasonable
indication of the benefits associated with fluidised-bed combustion as a
general  reactor  technology.  A  schematic  of  bubbling  and  circulating
fluidised-bed reactors is depicted in Fig. 5.

temperature increase results in a significant reduction in NOx emission
to a constant lower level [203,207,212,216].

Pilawska et al. [212] has found NO emission during the fluidised-bed
combustion of methane in air to be proportional to bed depth at low
temperatures and to be independent of bed depth above a certain critical
temperature. This is an interesting phenomenon which is not fully un-
derstood and warrants further research. Nonetheless, it is clear that a
fluidised-bed can yield efficient combustion of gaseous fuels with low
NOx emission although an improved understanding of burning NH3 in a
fluidised-bed  is  required  to  specifically  understand  NH3  combustion
behaviour in this reactor type.

3.3. Fluidised-Bed Combustion of Ammonia

Although there is little existing direct experience and knowledge on
fluidised-bed  NH3  combustion,  some  recent  work  by  Pan  et  al.  has
investigated  NH3  diffusion  fluidised-bed  combustion  [217,218]  and
NH3/O2  premixed  fluidised-bed  combustion  [219].  In  the  diffusion
scenarios,  2  combustion  locations  were  identified:  (1)  during  first
combination of NH3 and O2 and (2) during rupture of the bubble at the
bed  surface  [217,218]. These  observations indicate the  strong depen-
dence of combustion behaviour on mass transfer during NH3  diffusion
fluidised-bed  combustion  [217,218].  During  premixed  combustion,
however, ignition and complete combustion was observed during bub-
ble  growth  [219].  This  behaviour  was  dictated  by  bed  temperature,
which enhances chemical reaction rate and inter-phase mass transfer,
and  equivalence  ratio,  where  fuel-rich  conditions  produced  stable
spherical flames and fuel-lean conditions led to flame instability and a
shortened flame lifespan [219]. Co-firing NH3 with sub-bituminous coal

in a fluidised-bed has been investigated for varying co-firing ratios and
NH3 feed methods [220]. If fed via the wind box, the NH3 was found to
be effective for reduction of NO, CO, and CO2 emissions, while feed to
the dense bed zone resulted in CO emissions increasing over sevenfold in
spite of more effective NO reduction [220]. At a co-firing ratio of 25.4 %
and  NH3  fed  into  the  system  via  the  wind  box,  NO  emissions  were
reduced from 200 ppm to 120 ppm, while at a co-firing ratio of 15.1 %
and NH3 fed into the system via the dense bed zone, NO emissions were
reduced to 60 ppm [220]. Therefore, the NH3 feed method is critical for
NOx emission control which is vital in fluidised-bed NH3 combustion.

An overview of an expected combustion system, based on the ther-
mophysical properties of NH3, principles of fluidised-bed operation, and
knowledge of fluidised-bed combustion of other fuels, may suggest how
NH3 may be effectively used as a fuel in large-scale power generation. A
fluidised-bed  reactor  presents  a  complex  reaction  environment  which
must  be  carefully  designed  to  meet  the  performance  requirements  of
intended applications. The system must be able to ensure ignition and
provide  stable  combustion  by  avoiding  thermal  runaway,  explosion,
flashback, or blowout across a range of flowrates and temperatures to
safely  and  effectively  meet  changing  power  demands  [186,193,196].
While power can be extracted from the fluidised-bed system in several
ways, a typical, industrially mature, and effective way to accomplish this
is via a steam turbine Rankine cycle [186,193,221]. This requires water
to be heated to steam which drives a turbine before being condensed and
pumped  for  subsequent  steam  generation.  This  cycle  uses  the  heat
generated from the exothermic reaction to generate superheated steam
via a series of heat exchangers located in the fluidised-bed. Fig. 6 pre-
sents a schematic depicting the main aspects of design for a fluidised-bed
NH3 combustion power generation system.

In this system, reactant (fuel and air) premixing is avoided where
liquid NH3  and combustion air are delivered separately to reduce ex-
plosion risk [210]. Both streams are subject to preheating using the re-
sidual heat of the flue gas which vaporises the liquid NH3 and increases
the  temperature  of  the  reactants  to  maximise  reaction  efficiencies.  A
windbox is situated beneath the combustor to preheat the combustion
air and supply it, through a perforated distributor, to the fluidised-bed.
Separate larger tubes pass through the windbox and distributor to feed
NH3  gas into the combustor where NH3  and air are mixed and burnt.
Secondary air is introduced to the reactor freeboard to complete com-
bustion of any unreacted NH3.

3.3.1. General operation

At this stage, it is suggested that the fluidised-bed combustion of NH3
operate in the bubbling fluidisation regime and at atmospheric pressure
for greater controllability, operation reliability, and performance pre-
dictability,  although  future  developments  may  identify  circulating  or
pressurised  fluidised-bed  combustion  of  NH3  to  be  more  suitable  for
achieving  higher  throughput  in  larger  installations  with  reduced  per-
MW  CapEx.  The  fluidised-bed  acts  as  a  heat  reservoir  and  this  is  ex-
pected  to  greatly  assist  in  NH3  combustion  so  that  maximum  power,
with  low  levels  of  undesirable  emissions,  can  be  achieved  with  this
system. A high bed temperature, above the auto-ignition temperature of
NH3, say 1000 K [35,222], is required to provide adequate safety mar-
gins to ensure combustion [210].

While the system design dictates operation in the bubbling fluidised-
bed  regime  where  large  quantities  of  bed  material  are  not  regularly
expected to exit the reactor, cyclones are nonetheless attached to the
reactor to allow any particles which may be blown out of the bed to be
caught so that larger particles are returned to the combustor and very
fine particles are purged and discharged. Small particles resulting from
attrition are particularly prone to being blown out of the bed.

A gaseous fluidised-bed start-up procedure is reported by Cole and
Essenhigh (1972) and can serve as an indicative start-up procedure for
NH3  combustion [210]. A start-up fuel of, for example, natural gas or
LPG, is initially introduced with air in stoichiometric quantities, with the
combined  fuel-air  flowrate  set  to  10  %  of  the  total  flowrate  for  cold
incipient fluidisation and the gas ignited to burn in the freeboard. The
overbed flame heats the top layer of the bed material so that combustion
can start just below the bed surface and an increase in gas temperature
increases  the  upflow  velocity  to  above  the  minimum  fluidisation  ve-
locity which fluidises the top layer of particles. The fuel and air flowrates
may then be slowly adjusted so that the fluidised interface moves slowly
and  safely  towards  the  distributor.  When  the  system  achieves
steady-state at a given operating temperature, NH3  is gradually intro-
duced,  replacing  the  start-up  fuel,  and  the  system  performance  is
monitored to maintain a bed temperature, target product gas composi-
tion at acceptable levels of emission release, and steam output to meet
power  demands.  While  the  target  NH3  fluidised-bed  combustion  con-
ditions  are  case-specific,  the  development  of  a  pilot-scale  NH3
fluidised-bed combustor would be beneficial to accurately theorise some
conditions which may be suitable for practical operation.

3.3.2. Bed material

The bed material also acts as a heat reservoir to assist in the com-
bustion of NH3  and thus forms a crucial component of design and per-
formance of a fluidised-bed reactor. Particle density, size, and shape are
key properties of a bed material which, together with the reactor cross-
sectional area and bed depth, influence the fluidisation regime and thus
heat and mass transfer characteristics of the reactor. Additionally, par-
ticle  density,  size,  and  shape  determine  the  surface  to  volume  ratio
which influences bed material interaction with the gas phase reactions
[206,223â226],  in  addition  to  being  critical  factors  which  affect  the
attrition  and  erosion  characteristics  of  the  bed  material.  Smooth  and
round  bed  particles  are  thus  favourable  to  minimise  particle  attrition
and  erosion  of  the  heat  exchanger  tubes  and  reactor  walls.  Key

requirements  for  bed  material  selection  include  low  cost,  easy  avail-
ability, physical robustness, thermal stability and, ideally, an ability to
enhance  NH3  combustion  and  suppress  NOx  formation.  The  final  se-
lection of bed material type, size, and shape should, however, ultimately
be  based  on  target  power  generation  which  is  a  function  of  gas
throughput.

The bed material may either be catalytic or inert. An inert material
will not alter the reaction chemistry whereas a catalytic bed may pro-
mote  some  reactions  and  suppress  others.  Quartz  (mainly  SiO2)  and
alumina (Al2O3) present themselves as prime candidates since they meet
the selection criteria and have been widely reported in numerous liter-
ature studies [203,205â207,209â212,216,227â231]. While only specu-
lative  bed  material  prospects,  alternatives  including  manufactured
ceramic beads or beads fashioned from ironmaking blast furnace slags
are also able to meet the criteria, perhaps more effectively than quartz
and  alumina,  although  performance  expectations  would  need  to  be
established via practical work.

Although inert bed materials are ideal for studying fluidised-bed NH3
combustion,  a  catalytic  material  may  be  favourable  to  interact  with
species involved in the gas phase reaction and interfere with heat and
mass transfer in the bed. Fe-ZSM-5 (iron Zeolite Socony Mobilâ5) has
been studied in the selective catalytic oxidation of NH3 where, at 720 K,
a 99 % NH3 conversion with 100 % selectivity to nitrogen as product can
be achieved [232]. While these types of unique bed materials can offer
improved  thermal  conductivity  and  greater  overall  efficiency  when
compared to ordinary granular beds which exhibit lower thermal con-
ductivity (0.05 W/mK), they are generally not readily available and are
expensive,  making  it  difficult  to  justify  their  use  in  commercial  com-
bustion applications [233]. It may be noted, however, that the presence
of  an  effective  catalyst  decreases  the  activation  energy  so  that  NH3
combustion can proceed at lower temperatures which in turn reduces
thermal NOx formation.

To definitively comment on the suitability of a particular bed ma-
terial for fluidised-bed NH3 combustion, a variety of inert and catalytic
materials of different densities, sizes, and shapes need to be investigated
which,  coupled  with  an  economic  analysis,  would  allow  for  determi-
nation  of  the  most  suitable  bed  material  specification  for  practical
fluidised-bed NH3  combustion. While there are many bed material op-
tions  which  may  be  suitable  for  practical  implementation,  quartz,
alumina, ceramic, and ironmaking slag are advocated as suitable initial
research  prospects  before  investigating  alternative  or  highly  catalytic
materials in future.

3.3.3. Emission control

Ammonia and NOx are the two most prominent potential emissions
from  NH3  combustion,  both  of  which  are  toxic  and  environmentally
damaging.  Therefore,  a  strong  knowledge  and  controllability  of  the
system is required to ensure that all NH3  is burnt or removed prior to
release in the flue with minimal accompanying NOx emission [186,193,
196]. Decreasing equivalence ratios below stoichiometric (fuel lean) and
having high reactor temperatures is expected to strongly increase NO
formation and reduce residual NH3 [65,234,235], whereas combustion
under fuel rich conditions and low temperatures sees NO concentration
approach  zero  behind  the  reaction  zone  in  agreement  with  what  the
literature suggests is the De- NOx (SNCR) process, at the expense of some
unreacted NH3 [65,236]. A comprehensive investigation is thus required
to understand the effect of equivalence ratio, reaction temperature, and
flowrate (reaction time) on system performance to minimise the quan-
tities of pollutants in the reactor exit stream.

In practice, it is expected that a fluidised-bed NH3  combustor em-
ploys a lean condition (~É¸ = 0.9), appropriate temperature (~1000 K),
and sufficient gas residence time to ensure complete NH3 combustion for
maximum  fuel  economy,  heat  release,  and  minimal  NH3  emission.
Operation under fuel lean conditions may yield high concentrations of
NOx,  and  thus  require  NOx  control  strategies,  such  as  selective  non-
catalytic reduction (SNCR) which involves injection of NH3  or urea as

9

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 109 (2025) 101230

reductant into the freeboard to reduce NOx or, alternatively, installation
of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit for post-combustion NOx
control.  Both  SNCR  and  SCR  are  mature  technologies  widely  used  in
current  coal-fired  power  plants,  either  separately  or  in  combination.
Details on NOx chemistry, including methods for reducing NOx emis-
sions, are discussed in Section 5.

3.3.4. Steam generation

Fluidised-bed  combustion  of  NH3  presents  a  highly  erosive  and
corrosive environment, thereby requiring the heat exchanger tubes to be
resistant  to  erosion  by  the  bed  materials,  corrosion  by  both  NH3  and
NOx,  and  to  the  high  thermal  stresses  arising  from  the  elevated  bed
temperatures necessary to ensure combustion [193,210]. Stainless-steel
is typically used for water tubes and steam superheaters [237â243], the
presence of which may also influence the reaction chemistry and flu-
idisation parameters, making NH3 fired fluidised-bed boiler design more
challenging. Application of a ceramic coating to the outer layer of the
heat exchanger tubes is commonly practiced in fluidised-bed combus-
tion boilers [244â246] and could be highly beneficial for burning NH3.
Additionally, arrangement of the heat exchanger tubes is an important
aspect to allow for maximum heat transfer from the bed to the tubes
while minimising unwanted interference with the fluidisation behaviour
of  the  bed  and,  if  possible,  enhancing  NH3  combustion  and  reducing
NOx emission.

4. Fixed-bed oxidation and combustion

A knowledge of fixed-bed NH3 oxidation and combustion forms the
basis for understanding the impact of solid media on the reaction and
bridges  the  gap  between  flow  reactor  and  fluidised-bed  reactor  com-
bustion. In addition, it may also be possible for a commercially imple-
mented fluidised-bed reactor operating to meet normal power demands
to be transformed to operate in a fixed-bed regime at times of low load
requirement, making NH3 combustion in a fixed-bed of practical inter-
est.  An  understanding  of  the  principles  of  fixed-bed  reactors,  pre-
liminary  results  of  fixed-bed  NH3  oxidation  experiments,  and  the
combustion of other gases in fixed-beds, provides expectations for NH3
oxidation and combustion performance in the presence of solid media.

4.1. Principles of fixed-bed reactors

Fixed-bed  reactors,  much  like  their  fluidised-bed  reactor  counter-
parts, typically feature a circular cylinder body containing solid media

flow reactor NH3  oxidation at É¸ = 1 [67].

as the bed material [247,248]. The bed material is traditionally either a
solid fuel [249] or a solid-supported catalyst [247,248], although bed
material selection is highly dependent on the intended application of the
reactor.  A  fixed-bed  reactor  may  be  considered  a  special  case  of
fluidised-bed reactor where the gas velocity is not sufficiently high to
fluidise the bed particles [184]. This suggests that the bed particles, as
the name suggests, are âfixedâ as the gas flows through the reactor [184].
Since the particles remain in stationary positions, the direction of flow
can be either top-down or bottom-up, depending on the system design
and  required  operational  flexibility,  for  example,  if  the  reactor  is
required to be capable of operating in both fixed-bed and fluidised-bed
regimes. Although a fixed-bed reactor allows for greater heat transfer
between the bed material and the gases compared to a flow reactor, the
heat  and  mass  transfer  environment  is  not  as  effective  as  in  the
fluidised-bed scenario.

Fixed-bed reactor experimentation forms the foundation for under-
standing NH3 oxidation and combustion in solid media with respect to
the effect of operating parameters on reaction characteristics, i.e., the
effects of equivalence ratio, temperature, residence time, and bed ma-
terial on NH3  dissociation, oxidation, and NOx formation and destruc-
tion. A fixed-bed reactor thus functions primarily as a research tool to
provide  a  basis  for  subsequent  fluidised-bed  reactor  tests  which  have
more practical relevance. This is achieved through the development of
reaction  mechanisms  which  would  combine  research  output  derived
from computational modelling and laboratory experiments under well
controlled conditions. However, if combustion of NH3 in fluidised-beds
was  to  be  implemented  in  large-scale  power  generation  applications,
reduced commercial power demand during non-peak times would lead
to a decrease in flowrate through the fluidised-bed and transformation of
the flow regime to a fixed-bed, making the investigation into fixed-bed
combustion characteristics of additional practical importance.

4.2. Fixed-bed oxidation of ammonia

A knowledge of fixed-bed NH3 oxidation provides an understanding
of how the presence of a bed material can alter the characteristics of the
reaction. Our preliminary work, as well as literature reports considering
the  selective  catalytic  oxidation  (SCO)  of  NH3,  are  useful  to  broadly
understand  the  influence  of  bed  materials  on  NH3  oxidation.  In  our
recent study, NH3, O2, and Ar were mixed and fed to a heated 17 mm ID
quartz reactor [67]. Ar was used as a replacement for N2 in air for the
oxidation of NH3  as it allows more reliable tracking of nitrogen com-
pounds produced from NH3 oxidation [234]. Flow reactor experimental
runs under stoichiometric conditions were first conducted to establish a
baseline  for  comparison  with  subsequent  fixed-bed  reactor  runs.  This
base case indicated ~1300 K as the onset temperature of oxidation and
reaction  completion  at  1350  K  [67].  The  presence  of  the  quartz  bed
reduced the reaction onset temperature from ~1300 K (flow reactor) to
~1050 K (fixed-bed) with more steady and progressively significant NH3
conversion  taking  place  between  1050  K  and  1350  K  until  reaction
completion at 1400 K [67]. A graphical depiction of this phenomena, as
observed by Huo et al. [67], is presented in Fig. 7.

From Section 2, it is clear that the presence of hydrogen can signif-
icantly  improve  the  combustion  characteristics  of  NH3.  The  homoge-
neous decomposition of NH3 has an activation energy of 350 kJ/mol in a
flow  reactor  compared  to  147  kJ/mol  for  temperatures  ranging  from
1110 Kâ1230 K on a quartz sand surface [250,251], thus making the role
of NH3 dissociation of interest in the overall oxidation reaction. Ramsay
and Young [252] determined that NH3 decomposition in an empty plain
glass  tube  heated  to  1050  K  only  achieved  0.24  %  NH3  conversion,
although  when  this  glass  tube  was  filled  with  fragments  of  the  same
glass, NH3 decomposition increased to 1.72 %. This general observation
is  also supported  by our  recent NH3  dissociation  experiments in  both
flow and fixed-bed (packed with quartz particles) reactors which indi-
cated that, for a 5 % V/V NH3 in Ar feed, the flow reactor produced a NH3
conversion of ~1 %, ~1.4 %, and ~2.8 %, while the fixed-bed reactor

Fig.  8. Comparison  of  flame  speeds  of  selected  fuels  in  flow  reactor  [62,
115â140] and fixed-bed reactor [226,258â263] configurations.

produced a NH3 conversion of up to 2.3 %, 2.4 %, and 5.5 % (depending
on particle size), for furnace set temperatures of 1150 K, 1250 K, and
1400 K, respectively [253]. Ammonia dissociation is thus noticeable at
typical  reaction  temperatures  and  increases  in  the  presence  of  a  bed
material. Greater NH3  dissociation in the presence of solid media will
alter the chemistry during NH3 oxidation and combustion, and could be
a major reason for the improved fixed-bed NH3  oxidation characteris-
tics. Section 2 identifies partially dissociated NH3 as having better flame
stability, lower combustion temperatures, lower minimum ignition en-
ergies,  and  higher  flame  speeds  compared  to  NH3  alone,  thereby
corroborating  this  theory.  The  heat  reservoir  of  the  fixed-bed  could
provide rationale for increased NH3  dissociation and/or influence the
NH3  oxidation reaction in more complex ways than what can be pres-
ently explained, thus calling for further research effort which documents
more detailed datasets via the measurement of all major chemical spe-
cies  under  varying  conditions.  This  experimental  data,  coupled  with
computational  kinetic  modelling,  would  provide  an  improved  under-
standing  of  the  influence  that  different  bed  materials  and  operating
conditions have on NH3 dissociation and oxidation.

4.3. Fixed-Bed Combustion of Ammonia

A bed material can influence gas phase reactions in two ways: (1) by
acting as a thermal reservoir thereby improving heat transfer and (2) by
directly altering the chemistry of reaction via promotion or suppression
of  radicals.  Although  there  is  some  literature  on  the  oxidation  and
combustion of NH3  over high-activity catalysts [254â257], analysis of
the combustion of other fuels in the presence of more generic (and inert)
solid media provides useful insight into the effect of a thermal reservoir
on performance expectations for NH3 combustion in a fixed-bed reactor.

4.3.1. Flame speed

Flame  speed  (or  burning velocity)  is  a  key  characteristic  in  deter-
mining the ease of continual and stable combustion of a fuel and, while
there are no existing studies on the flame speed of NH3 in the presence of
solid  media,  experimental  flame  speed  studies  of  hydrogen  [258],
methane (near equivalent to natural gas) [226,258â262], and propane
[258,263] in the presence of a bed material have previously been un-
dertaken. Fig. 8 presents data comparing the flame speeds of these gases
in  the  presence  of  solid  media  with  their  freely  propagating  flame
speeds.

Fig. 8 indicates that increased flame speed can be achieved in the

Fig. 9. Comparison of selected fuelsâ lower flammability limits in the presence
of solid media [226,264â266] with their flammability limits not in the presence
of solid media [52,55,103,107â109,264].

presence of solid media when compared to freely propagating flames.
The influence of bed material on flame speed, however, is dependent on
temperature, fuel concentration, and particle size. Additional fixed-bed
studies conducted more rigorously across a wider range of equivalence
ratios, however, would facilitate more credible comment on the impact
of bed material on flame speed, particularly at stoichiometric and rich
equivalence ratios. Based on the data in Fig. 8, it is expected that NH3
combustion  in  a  fixed-bed  reactor  can  have  faster  flame  speeds  than
those in a flow reactor given the specification of suitable reaction pa-
rameters, thereby improving combustion stability and allowing greater
operational flexibility.

4.3.2. Flammability limits

As discussed in Section 2 and depicted in Fig. 3, NH3 has a noticeably
higher LFL than many other fuels. A reduction in the LFL can be bene-
ficial for the practical use of a fuel by allowing combustion at leaner
equivalence  ratios  and  thus  improved  total  mass  flowrate  capability
through a combustor, leading to improved convective heat transfer and
greater  flexibility  in  reactor  design  and  operation.  By  analysing  the
change in flammability limits for the combustion of other fuels in the
presence  of  solid  media,  expectations  for  the  flammability  limits  of
fixed-bed NH3 combustion in solid media may be established.

The super-adiabatic combustion of Tokyo city gas, comprising 88 %
methane, 5.8 % ethane, 4.5 % propane, 1.7 % butane, in a Cordierite or
Cerafoam  porous  media  was  considered  by  Hoffman  et  al.  [264]  and
indicated that the lean flammability limit could be reduced to ~0.3 %
from what is normally ~5 %. Hsu et al. [226] observed the lean flam-
mability limit reach 4 % for the combustion of methane in the presence
of  partially  stabilised  zirconia.  Kotani  et  al.  [265]  investigated  the
combustion of propane in the presence of porous alumina and found that
the lower flammability limit could be reduced to ~0.6 % from what is
normally ~2 %. Liu et al. [266] also investigated propane combustion in
porous alumina, reporting a lower flammability limit of 1.2 %. Fig. 9
depicts a graphical representation of the reduction in lower flammability
limits of these gaseous fuels during combustion in the presence of solid
media [226,264â266] when compared to their non-solid media [52,55,
103,107â109,264] lower flammability limits.

From  an  analysis  of  the  data  presented  in  these  different  publica-
tions, it is apparent that the lean flammability limit of various gases in
solid media can be extended due to the excellent heat transfer of the bed

material. This is particularly important for NH3  which has a high LFL
compared to several other commonly used fuels, thereby allowing NH3
combustion  to  proceed  with  larger  quantities  of  oxidant  at  leaner
equivalence ratios for greater and more flexible power generation.

4.3.3.

Implications for ammonia combustion

A  solid  bed  allows  for  effective  heat  transfer  via  conductive  and
radiative  pathways  from  the  post-flame  zone  to  the  pre-flame  zone
which preheats the incoming gas [260,267â271]. This yields improved
combustion stability, faster flame speeds, and an extended  lean flam-
mability  limit,  making  the  presence  of  bed  material  favourable  for
burning  lower  energy  content  fuels,  such  as  NH3  [267,270].  This  is
highly  beneficial  in  maximising  reactor  efficiencies  and  providing
greater  flexibility  in  practical  operation  to  meet  changing  consumer
power demands. The impact of bed material on NOx emission resulting
from the combustion of various fuels in the presence of solid bed ma-
terial  has  not  yet  been  well  documented,  thereby  providing  research
opportunities to investigate how combustion in a fixed-bed reactor in-
fluences NOx chemistry.

5. NOx in ammonia combustion

NO and NO2 (NOx) emission is a cause of concern in the combustion
of any fuel, particularly NH3 [272]. As a fuel which contains a high level
of fuel-bound nitrogen (82 % W/W), the combustion of NH3 has received
a significant amount of criticism pertaining to its suitability as a fuel in
meeting NOx emission standards. However, by understanding the ways
in which NOx is produced, the role of a bed material in NOx formation
and destruction, and alternate means of NOx reduction via traditional
technologies,  expectations  surrounding  NOx  emission  in  fixed-  and
fluidised-bed reactors become clear.

5.1. NOx formation routes

Although NO2 is without a doubt an unwanted reaction product, NO
presents itself as the main concern where it comprises 90 %â95 % of NOx
in a typical flue gas [273] and thus demands most of the attention when
considering NOx formation and destruction. There are three routes for
NOx formation: (1) thermal NOx, (2) prompt NOx, and (3) fuel NOx.
Thermal  NOx proceeds  via the well-established Zeldovich mechanism
with oxidation of atmospheric N2 [274]. The mechanism takes place at
elevated temperatures (>1800 K) [275â277] due to the high activation
energy required to break the N2  triple bond, as shown in Reaction 3,
which is identified as the rate limiting step [236,276,278,279].

O2 + N2âNO + N

(R.3)

234,236,272,281],  NH3  combustion  produces  fuel  NOx  primarily  via
HNO (itself produced from NH2) and, to a lesser extent, via H, NO2, OH,
and NH.

(R.11)

Since  operation  of  a  NH3  fluidised-bed  combustor  is  likely  to  be
below the thermal NOx formation threshold, and that prompt NOx is
expected to be insignificant, fuel NOx is suggested to be the dominant
mechanism [284].

While not strictly considered a component of NOx, N2O is an oxide of
nitrogen  that  is  closely  related  to  NO  and  NO2.  Although  it  typically
exists  as  a  reaction  intermediate,  there  are  conditions  which  may  be
expected  to  yield  N2O  as  a  product  of  NH3  oxidation.  Pathways  that
incorporate N2O generally dominate under fuel lean conditions at high
pressure  and  moderate  temperature  [236,285].  For  instance,  N2O
emission via Reaction 12 is prevalent at high oxygen concentrations and
low temperatures [236,286,287].

NH2 + NO2âN2O + H2O

(R.12)

The  most  common  path  for  N2O  formation  is  via  the  reaction  be-
tween an NH radical (hydrogen atom abstraction from NH3) and NO,
according to Reaction 13. This N2O, however, is normally quickly des-
tructed in Reaction 14 [234,272,286], indicating the typical role that
N2O plays as a reaction intermediate.

NH + NOâN2O + H

N2O + HâN2 + OH

(R.13)

(R.14)

At high temperatures and low oxygen concentrations, it is possible

that N2O emission can occur via Reaction 15 [281,286,287].

NH + NOâN2O + H

(R.15)

Therefore,  for  a  practical  NH3  fluidised-bed  combustor  that  is  ex-
pected to operate at high temperatures and slightly fuel lean (high ox-
ygen)  concentrations,  emission  of  N2O  is  not  expected  to  be  of  any
reasonable concern, leaving NO and NO2  to be the primary oxides of
nitrogen in the reactor product.

The nitrogen atoms resulting from Reaction 3 are rapidly oxidised in

(R.5)

Prompt or Fenimore NOx involves atmospheric N2  combining with
fuel  in  fuel  rich  conditions  before  being  oxidised  to  NOx  [280â282].
While explanations of this mechanism more commonly involve hydro-
carbon fuels with the initiating step proceeding according to Reaction 6
[236,279,281â283], this NOx formation route could also apply to other
fuels, such as NH3.

CH + N2âNCN + H

(R.6)

The chemistry of prompt NOx formation during NH3  combustion is
not well researched  and is anticipated to be negligible as  N2  will not
readily combine with NH3, supported by the lack of NH3 + N2 reactions
in several widely accepted NH3 oxidation mechanisms.

Fuel NOx refers to the oxidation of fuel-bound nitrogen [279]. While
the reaction chemistry is highly complex and detailed elsewhere [65,66,

While  there  is  a  substantial  body  of  literature  on  NOx  emissions
resulting  from the combustion  of hydrocarbon-NH3  mixtures, there  is
limited knowledge on NOx resulting from exclusive NH3 combustion, let
alone  NH3  combustion  in  the  presence  of  solid  media.  This  provides
motivation  to  undertake  a  dedicated  NH3  oxidation  and  combustion
experimental  campaign,  which  is  able  to  compare  NOx  emissions  at
varying experimental conditions for flow reactor, fixed-bed reactor, and
fluidised-bed reactor scenarios, to understand the impact of bed material
on NOx chemistry. Such experimental work should also investigate the
impact of flame structure on NOx formation and, more specifically, the
local temperature and gas composition including the presence of radi-
cals.  As  experienced  firsthand  in  our  recent  NH3  combustion  experi-
mental work, there would be major differences between combustion/
flame in the gas phase and combustion/flame in a bed of solid media,
and thus future experimental research would be highly beneficial. NOx
and CO levels resulting from combustion of methane in air in the pres-
ence  of  bed  material  indicated  rising  NOx  levels  with  increasing
equivalence  ratios  under  fuel  lean  conditions,  corresponding  to

12

S.R. Holden et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 109 (2025) 101230

increasing flame speeds [288,289]. The observed increasing flame speed
is unsurprising since greater exothermicity is achieved as equivalence
ratios rise for É¸ < 1, leading to greater thermal NOx formation.

Of more direct relevance are the experiments on NH3 oxidation in the
presence of a quartz bed carried out by Huo et al. [67] which show that
the presence of a quartz fixed-bed, compared to a flow reactor, resulted
in  significantly  reduced  NOx  emissions  at  lean  and  stoichiometric
equivalence ratios. At 1350 K, for example, the NO concentration was
1969  ppm  in  the  flow  reactor  compared  to  25  ppm  in  the  fixed-bed
reactor at É¸ = 0.5, while at É¸ = 1, the NO concentration was 578 ppm
in the flow reactor and 66 ppm for the fixed-bed reactor [67]. Several
possibilities exist for NOx curtailment in the presence of solid bed ma-
terial:  (1)  greater  NH3  dissociation  into  respective  radicals,  thus
lowering the reaction temperature and reducing ease of NOx formation,
(2)  preference  for  the  reduction  reaction  of  NOx  with  NH3,  and  (3)
increased prevalence of side-reactions that do not favour NOx forma-
tion.  The reasons  for  the  reduced  NOx levels  in  the  presence  of  solid
media  are  not  yet  well  understood,  although  an  explanation  will  be
provided following more rigorous data collection in future experimental
studies.

5.3. Reducing NOx emissions

The two broad technical means for control of NOx emissions include
combustion modifications and flue gas treatment. Combustion modifi-
cations influence NOx formation and destruction by controlling the re-
action  environment  whereas  flue  gas  treatment  is  implemented  to
reduce  the  NOx  formed  during  combustion  by  converting  it  to  N2.
Reducing excess air and reaction temperatures is likely to minimise NOx
emission, although this is undesirable as the unreacted fuel will lead to
cost  inefficiencies  and  pose  separate  challenges  in  safe  flue  gas
discharge. Additionally, highly preheated air combustion, likely to be
achieved by heating the incoming air with the flue gases, is expected to
reduce  NOx  emission.  Other  techniques  used  to  reduce  NOx  in  the
reactor include air staging, fuel staging, and flue gas recirculation. Flue
gas recirculation is, however, not recommended as it reduces thermal
output  and  is  thus  undesirable  for  NH3  fluidised-bed  combustion  in
large-scale power generation applications. Alternatively, careful design
and  operation  of  a  reactor  could  incorporate  air  or  fuel  staging,  an
example of which would involve a fuel rich primary zone to suppress
fuel NOx formation before the resulting gases enter a fuel lean secondary
zone to completely consume the fuel, at the expense of increased NOx. A
resulting reduction of NOx emissions by 30 %â60 % has been observed
for a staged air compared to a single stage combustor [46,284,290â294],
while  a  staged  fuel  combustor  has  been  observed  to  be  capable  of
providing a 50 %â70 % reduction in NOx emissions compared to a single
stage fuel combustor [295â297]. It should be noted, however, that air
and fuel staging will likely result in slightly reduced combustion effi-
ciencies [294].

Gibbs et al. [294] investigated the reduction of NOx emissions from a
fluidised-bed  coal  combustor  [298]  utilising  staged  air  combustion
combined with in-situ post-combustion NH3  addition at a bed temper-
ature of 1143 K. For introduction of NH3 in a NH3:NO mole ratio of 0.6
(stoichiometric is 0.66), a non-staged combustor yielded a reduction in
NOx  of  36  %,  while  with  staged  operation  it  was  46  %  [294].  NOx
reduction of over 60 % was achieved for NH3 together with air staging
above NH3:NO ratios of 3 [294]. On the other hand, fuel staging coupled
with NH3  or urea [CO(NH2)2] injected in the reactor post-combustion
region has been found to reduce NOx emissions by up to 85 % [295,
296,299]. The effectiveness of air staging and secondary NH3 addition is
thus highly beneficial in treating NOx emissions and future experiments
using  different  configurations  of  these  arrangements  for  fluidised-bed
NH3  combustion  are  strongly  encouraged  to  understand  the  effects
that these aspects of reactor design and operation have on NOx emission,
unconverted NH3, and combustion efficiency.

If NOx concentrations in the reactor exit stream are unable to meet

the required levels for safe environmental release, residual NOx can be
further reduced by commercially mature selective non-catalytic reduc-
tion  (SNCR)  or  selective  catalytic  reduction  (SCR)  technology  which
commonly use NH3 or CO(NH2)2 as the reductant [22â33,223,273,286,
300â302].  Richard  K  Lyon  notably  developed  a  patent  for  the  SNCR
process for ExxonMobil in 1975 [303], with both SNCR and SCR being
commercially  implemented  in  the  1970s  [22].  The  accompanying
implemented  for
principles  of  SNCR  and  SCR  remain  widely
post-combustion NOx treatment of a variety of different fuels. The main
reactions for NOx removal using NH3  as a reductant are presented in
Reactions 16 and 17 [22]:

4NO + 4NH3 + O2â4N2 + 6H2O

6NO2 + 8NH3â7N2 + 12H2O

(R.16)

(R.17)

SNCR relies on gas phase NH3 reactions with NOx proceeding in the
self-sustaining reaction region between 1100 K and 1400 K [22,272,286,
300,304]. Temperatures below this range result in significantly slower
reaction rates, while temperatures above the range upper limit favour
NH3  oxidation to NO in preference to N2  [286]. SNCR NOx reduction
efficiencies of 30 %â70 % are typically achieved although efficiencies as
high as 80 % are also possible [22]. The accompanying unreacted NH3 is
generally <25 ppm, with possibilities of achieving 5 ppmâ10 ppm under
certain conditions [22].

SCR  uses  a  base  metal  catalyst,  typically  supported  on  ceramic
monolith or zeolite, to catalyse NOx reduction with a reductant, such as
NH3 or CO(NH2)2 [22,23,301,305]. Recent years have seen research into
the use of alternative reductants, such as CO and unburnt hydrocarbons
[306â312], that may be conveniently applied to fossil fuel combustion
systems, however, for fluidised-bed NH3  combustion, NH3  is naturally
the logical choice. SCR is generally conducted at 473 Kâ673 K [22,284],
reducing NOx by 80 %â90 % [22]. Although NOx reduction increases
with  increasing  NH3:NOx  ratio,  a  ratio  of  â¤1  is  typically  selected  to
achieve a NH3 emission of <5 ppm [22]. It is not surprising, therefore,
that  SCR  is  more  widely  used  than  SNCR  as  it  is  more  effective  in
reducing NOx emissions  with less  NH3  slip and  thus  more capable of
achieving the strict standards for environmental release of these toxic
gases [22].

It is expected that, similar to many other industrial-scale combustors,
fixed-  and  fluidised-bed  NH3  combustion  will  be  practically  operated
under slightly fuel lean conditions to ensure complete consumption of
NH3. This may result in unacceptable levels of NOx in the flue which,
depending  on  budget,  regulatory  requirements,  and  NOx  concentra-
tions, could employ SNCR or SCR to ensure safe environmental release
standards are achieved.

6. The way forward

In considering the use of NH3  as a  carbon-free fuel for large-scale
stationary  power  generation,  the  present  review  has  systematically
examined the thermophysical properties and combustion characteristics
of  NH3.  Compared  to  conventional  and  common  gaseous  fuels,  NH3
combustion in large-scale applications has been demonstrated to suffer
from  a  series  of  drawbacks:  (1)  high  auto-ignition  temperature  and
ignition energy lead to challenges in initiating and maintaining a stable
NH3 flame; (2) low laminar flame speed causes poor NH3 flame stability
and  low  gas  throughout;  (3)  high  lower  flammability  limit  restricts
operational flexibility; (4) low LHV/HHV ratio results in low inherent
thermal  efficiency;  and  (5)  potentially  high  fuel  NOx  formation  and
emission. The review identifies that fluidised-bed combustion offers a
means of overcoming these difficulties. Owing to the large heat reservoir
of the hot bed material, fluidised-bed combustion offers inherent fuel
flexibility which guarantees NH3  ignition and stable combustion. The
fluidised-bed combustion of NH3 also affords large gas throughput and,
therefore, high combustion intensity and heat release due to the excel-
lent heat and mass transfer environment. Variable load operation is also

13

possible with different gas flowrates, potentially resulting in transition
between bed operating regimes. In addition, NOx emission control via
SNCR and/or SCR can be easily implemented.

In  order  to  realise  fluidised-bed  NH3  combustion  for  large-scale
stationary power generation, further research and development efforts
are  warranted.  Fundamental  research  should  focus  on  the  chemistry,
kinetics, and mechanisms of NH3 dissociation and oxidation, as well as
NOx  formation  and  in-situ  destruction  pathways,  particularly  in  the
presence  of a bed of solid material. The interactions between the  gas
phase chemistry and the surface chemistry of the bed material in NH3
dissociation, oxidation, and NOx formation and destruction, can guide
the choice of bed material and assist in optimising combustion. This calls
for  deployment  of  laser  diagnostics,  synchrotron,  and  advanced  mass
spectrometry techniques to examine the reaction chemistry at a radical
level. Reactor engineering and technology development should embrace
the selection of bed material that is fundamental to the desired fluid-
isation  regime,  fluidised-bed  configuration  and  operation,  and  ulti-
mately, NH3 combustion performance and NOx emission. The physical
properties  of  the  bed  material,  together  with  the  fluidised-bed  di-
mensions, determine the range of fluidising gas throughput and thus the
NH3  combustion  and  heat  release  intensity,  heat  transfer,  and  steam
generation  capability.  Engineering  design  and  optimisation  should
consider  several  integrate  of  all  aspects  of  the  system,  including  NH3
storage, injection, and slipping management, the selection of corrosion
and erosion resistant materials for NH3 handling and reactor internals,
and  remote  sensing  and  monitoring  techniques  for  optimal  process
control. NOx formation from both fuel NOx and thermal NOx routes, in-
situ  destruction  of  NOx  by  NH3,  and  suppression  of  NOx  by  the  bed
material,  remain  interesting  and  challenging  scientific  questions  that
demand  detailed  research.  NOx  emission  is,  however,  not  a  major
concern for large-scale fluidised-bed NH3  combustion as mature tech-
nologies such as SNCR or SCR can be readily deployed to reduce NOx to
acceptable levels. The possibility of incorporating catalytic combustion
poses  an  interesting  research  question  which  invites  future  investiga-
tion.  These  research  and  development  needs  can  be  best  served  with
cross-disciplinary collaborations and collaborations amongst academia,
industry, business, and government agencies.
