    "question_text": "Derive the Langmuir isotherm model for SO2 adsorption on biochar considering both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms, and explain how nitrogen functionalization alters the adsorption parameters.",
    "standard_answer": "The Langmuir isotherm combines physisorption (θ_phy) and chemisorption (θ_chem) terms: θ_total = θ_phy + θ_chem = (b_phy·P)/(1+b_phy·P) + (b_chem·P)/(1+b_chem·P), where b represents adsorption affinity constants. For plain biochar, physisorption dominates (high b_phy from micropores) while chemisorption is negligible. Nitrogen functionalization introduces basic sites via reactions like R2CH3N + SO2 + ½O2 + H2O → (R2CH3NH)2·SO4, increasing b_chem dramatically. The modified isotherm becomes θ_total' = (b_phy·P)/(1+b_phy·P) + (b_chem'·P)/(1+b_chem'·P), where b_chem' >> b_chem. At high temperatures (>100°C), the physisorption term diminishes (exothermic), making chemisorption dominant as observed experimentally with MDEA-modified biochar showing 156.22 mg/g capacity at 100°C.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The adsorption capacity of SO2 by unmodified biochar is generally at a low amount of less than 20 mg_SO2/g_biochar",
      "2": "The MDEA mass concentration was added to 1% and 4%, the deteriorated pore structure significantly destroyed the adsorption of SO2 compared with biocharCO2"
