    "question_text": "Considering the CO poisoning mechanism in PEMFCs, the adsorption of CO on Pt catalysts exhibits different bonding modes (linear vs. bridge) depending on surface coverage. Using the data in Figure 2, explain the relationship between CO concentration, surface coverage, and the dominant adsorption mode. Analyze how this shift in bonding configuration impacts the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, and derive the relationship between the CO coverage (θ_CO) and the anodic overpotential under galvanostatic operation, incorporating the Temkin isotherm and the interaction parameter r.",
    "standard_answer": "The type of CO adsorption on Pt is coverage-dependent. At low surface coverages (<50%), bridge-bonded CO dominates, while at higher coverages (saturation), linear-bonded CO prevails (Figure 2). This evolution is critical because linear-bonded CO has a higher binding energy and is more difficult to oxidize, significantly affecting HOR kinetics. The CO coverage θ_CO is governed by the Temkin isotherm: θ_CO = [-ΔG°_0 - RT ln(H^+ * [CO]/[H₂]) / r. Here, ΔG°_0 is the standard free energy of adsorption, r is the interaction parameter (structure-dependent), and H is Henry's constant for CO solubility. As θ_CO increases, the available Pt sites for H₂ adsorption and HOR decrease. The anodic overpotential η_anode increases to compensate for the reduced active area, ensuring the prescribed current density. The anodic overpotential η_anode can be related to θ_CO through the Butler-Volmer equation, where the exchange current density for HOR is reduced proportionally. Consequently, the cell voltage drops, and the power density is reduced, especially at low current densities where kinetic losses dominate. At high current densities, the anode potential may reach values where CO electro-oxidation occurs, partially restoring performance, as seen in potential oscillations.",

    "question_text": "In high-temperature PEMFCs (HT-PEMFCs) operating above 150°C, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction becomes significant. Starting from the RWGS reaction (Eq. 9), derive the equilibrium constant expression for CO production via RWGS. Then, using the energy balance, explain how the operating temperature influences the CO tolerance by comparing the adsorption energies of H₂ and CO.",
    "standard_answer": "In HT-PEMFCs, the RWGS reaction (CO₂ + H₂ ⇌ CO + H₂O) is endothermic (ΔH > 0). The equilibrium constant K_RWGS = [CO][H₂O] / [CO₂][H₂]. The van't Hoff equation shows that K_RWGS increases with temperature, favoring CO formation. The adsorption energy of CO on Pt is approximately 134 kJ mol⁻¹, while for H₂ it is 87.9 kJ mol⁻¹, so CO adsorption is stronger. However, increasing temperature reduces the CO coverage θ_CO because the adsorption isotherm shifts. The free energy of adsorption ΔG_ads for CO is more negative than for H₂, so CO poisoning is more severe at low temperatures. However, at high temperatures, the HOR kinetics are accelerated, and the CO electro-oxidation rate increases. The CO stripping potential decreases with temperature, enabling CO removal at lower overpotentials. The Temkin isotherm accounts for adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, where parameter r increases with temperature, leading to a broader distribution of adsorption energies and a lower θ_CO at steady state for the same CO partial pressure. Therefore, HT-PEMFCs can tolerate up to 5% CO in the anode feed, as shown in Figure 29.",

    "question_text": "For the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process used in hydrogen purification, describe the adsorption mechanism of CO on porous materials like zeolites. Then, derive the governing mass transfer equations for CO in the adsorbent bed, considering both advection along the flow channel and lateral diffusion, using the data in Figure 13.",
    "standard_answer": "PSA is a cyclic adsorption process. For CO removal, the feed gas (reformate) is introduced at high pressure (5-10 bar). CO is selectively adsorbed due to its higher affinity compared to H₂. The mass transfer of CO in the bed is governed by the advection-diffusion equation: ∂C_CO/∂t + u·∇C_CO = D_eff ∇²C_CO, where C_CO is the CO concentration, u is the superficial velocity, and D_eff is the effective diffusivity. The distribution of CO adsorption in a single channel (Figure 13) shows anisotropy at low flow rates due to dominant lateral diffusion, while at high flow rates, advection dominates, leading to a more uniform distribution. The lateral diffusion coefficient D_lat is estimated from Figure 13. At low flow rates, CO spreads laterally, leading to uneven poisoning. At high flow rates, the advection term dominates, resulting in a more uniform distribution along the channel. The adsorption equilibrium is described by the Langmuir or Temkin isotherms. The breakthrough time t_b depends on the adsorption capacity q_max and the flow rate. For a typical adsorbent, q_max for CO is around 2-3 mol kg⁻¹ for zeolites. The adsorption rate is proportional to the partial pressure of CO. The process requires cyclic operation with multiple columns for continuous purification.",

    "standard_answer": "When both CO and H₂S are present, H₂S displaces CO from the Pt surface over time (Figure 7). This occurs because the heat of adsorption for H₂S on Pt is higher than for CO. The competitive adsorption follows: Pt-CO + H₂S → Pt-S + CO + H₂. The cyclic voltammograms show the CO stripping peak diminishing as H₂S exposure time increases. The S-species form stronger bonds with Pt, leading to irreversible poisoning. The free energy of adsorption ΔG_ads for H₂S is more negative than for CO. The displacement process is kinetically controlled. Initially, CO adsorbs rapidly. Then, H₂S gradually replaces CO because the Pt-S bond is more stable. This combined poisoning accelerates the degradation by reducing the ECSA and increasing the charge transfer resistance. In contrast to CO, which can be partially oxidized, S-species are not easily removed, causing permanent damage. The overall overpotential increases more than additively, as H₂S blocks sites permanently. Thus, mitigation strategies must address both contaminants.",

    "standard_answer": "In an ECPrOx unit, the anode is fed with reformate containing high CO concentrations (e.g., 9380 ppm CO). Under galvanostatic control, spontaneous potential oscillations occur, enhancing CO electro-oxidation. The key reactions are: CO adsorption (Eq. 4), electrochemical CO oxidation (Eq. 6), and the parasitic hydrogen oxidation. The current efficiency η_ECPrOx for CO removal is defined as η_ECPrOx = (2F * J_CO) / I_total, where J_CO is the molar flux of CO oxidized. The CO oxidation rate is given by the Butler-Volmer equation. For a PtRu/C anode, the CO stripping potential is lower than for Pt, facilitating oxidation. The CO concentration at the outlet C_CO,out is related to the inlet C_CO,in by: C_CO,out = C_CO,in - (I_CO / (2F * Q_anode), where I_CO is the current used for CO oxidation, and Q_anode is the anode volumetric flow rate. The model from Zhang and Datta predicts the oscillatory behavior, where the period decreases with increasing current density or temperature.
