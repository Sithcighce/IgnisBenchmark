    "standard_answer": "Stabilizing premixed ammonia-hydrogen flames in gas turbines presents several challenges due to ammonia's low reactivity and slow laminar burning velocity (~0.07 m/s compared to methane's ~0.38 m/s). The primary kinetic mechanisms involve: 1) The high activation energy required for NH3 decomposition (NH3 → NH2 + H), which is rate-limiting; 2) The competition between NO formation pathways (via NH + O → NO + H) and recombination reactions (NH + NO → N2 + OH); 3) The strong dependence on hydrogen doping (>40% by energy) to accelerate radical pool formation through H + O2 → OH + O. At equivalence ratios φ > 1.1, OH radical recombination with NH2 becomes significant, but the narrow flammability limits (18-28% fuel mole fraction) and high ignition energy (~8J vs methane's 0.28mJ) make stable operation difficult. Computational studies using Konnov's mechanism show that turbulent flame speeds must exceed 5 m/s for practical applications, requiring careful optimization of swirl number and residence time distributions.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The results showed the complexity in stabilizing premixed ammonia blends, identifying a particular pattern of oxygen consumption that was followed by flame speed reduction, retarding the combustion process and eventually pushing the flame back into the combustion chamber",
      "2": "Ammonia has a flammability limit that ranges from ∼18 to 28% fuel mole fraction. Therefore, dilution systems are needed to avoid this range when hot surfaces or combustion devices are in use nearby"

    "question_text": "Derive the adiabatic flame temperature for stoichiometric ammonia-air combustion considering thermal dissociation of products, and compare it with methane-air combustion under the same conditions.",
    "standard_answer": "The stoichiometric reaction for ammonia combustion is: 4NH3 + 3O2 + 11.28N2 → 2N2 + 6H2O + 11.28N2 (ΔH° = -1267 kJ/mol). Using NASA polynomials for specific heats and solving the energy balance equation Σni(h°f,i + ∫cp,idT)products = Σnj(h°f,j + ∫cp,jdT)reactants, we account for dissociation of H2O ↔ H2 + 0.5O2 and N2 + O2 ↔ 2NO. At 1 atm, the adiabatic flame temperature is ~1850K, significantly lower than methane's ~2223K due to: 1) Higher nitrogen content absorbing heat (71% vs 68% for CH4); 2) Endothermic NH3 decomposition (NH3 → 0.5N2 + 1.5H2, ΔH = +46 kJ/mol); 3) Reduced heat release from N2 formation versus CO2 formation. The temperature can be approximated by T_ad = (-ΔH°c)/[Σx_iCp_i] where x_i are product mole fractions. For NH3, this yields ~1800K versus ~2100K for CH4, consistent with experimental measurements.",

    "standard_answer": "Using the Arrhenius expression k = 5.6×10^4 exp(-Ea/RT) with Ea = 180 kJ/mol and T = 1073K: k = 5.6×10^4 exp[-180000/(8.314×1073)] = 12.7 s^-1. For first-order kinetics, the conversion X relates to residence time τ via X = 1 - exp(-kτ). Solving for 95% conversion (X=0.95): 0.95 = 1 - exp(-12.7τ) → τ = -ln(0.05)/12.7 = 0.235s. This matches experimental observations where τ > 200ms is needed for >90% conversion at 1073K. The space velocity SV = 1/τ = 4.25 s^-1 (15,300 h^-1) indicates practical reactor sizing.

    "standard_answer": "The Kalina cycle achieves 20% higher efficiency than Rankine cycles for low-grade heat (<150°C) through three key mechanisms: 1) Variable-temperature boiling: The ammonia-water zeotrope (typically 70-80% NH3) exhibits a gradual temperature glide during evaporation/condensation (e.g., 30K glide vs water's isothermal phase change), better matching the heat source/sink temperature profiles and reducing exergy destruction. The temperature glide ΔT_glide = T_bubble - T_dew can reach 50K for x_NH3=0.7 mixtures at 10bar. 2) Reduced pumping work: The mixture's lower liquid specific volume (~1.5×10^-3 m^3/kg vs water's 1.0×10^-3 at 100°C) decreases pump power W_pump = vΔP/η_pump. 3) Recuperative heat exchange: The concentration difference between turbine exhaust (~40% NH3) and absorber inlet (~80%) enables efficient heat recovery via solution heat exchangers. The efficiency η = 1 - T_cold/T_hot improves by ~5% points due to 20K lower average rejection temperature.",
