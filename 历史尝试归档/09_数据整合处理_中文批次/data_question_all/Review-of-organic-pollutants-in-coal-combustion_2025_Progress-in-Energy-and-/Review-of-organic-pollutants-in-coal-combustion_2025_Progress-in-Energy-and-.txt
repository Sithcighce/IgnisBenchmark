Organic pollutants are acknowledged as one of the primary environmental hazards in the atmosphere, posing a
significant threat to human health and the environment. This work provides a critical review of the recent
research on organic pollutants from stationary coal-burning sources, including an overview of the effect of coal
composition and coal source, the types of organics material in coal, the generation of organic pollutants during
coal combustion, emission of organic pollutants, co-removal by air pollution control devices (APCDs), and the
technologies used to remove organic pollutants from coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). Field sampling and
analysis showed that the organic pollutants produced from coal combustion processes are mainly composed of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organic components in
condensable particulate matter (CPM). The VOCs and CPM are mainly discharged into the atmosphere as part of
the gas and particulate phases, respectively, whereas, PAHs are mainly concentrated in fly ash and bottom ash.
The generation of organic pollutants during coal combustion is mainly affected by coal grade, temperature,
heating rate, residence time, and pressure. Considering that the flue gas temperature and composition can vary
from one CFPP location to another, the choice of the sampling methods is based on the specific needs of a CFPP.
Because, the selection of a sampling method can significantly affect the final results and should be given special
attention. Typical sampling methods for VOCs, PAHs, and CPM are summarized and their advantages and dis-
advantages are compared. The adsorption tube sampling method is more suitable for the sampling of VOCs
because it is not limited by the volume and miscellaneous components of the flue gas. EPA Method 0010 and the
dry impactor condensation method (EPA Method 202) are more suitable for sampling PAHs and CPM in flue gas
due to their higher accuracy. The APCDs in CFPPs have organic pollutants co-removal abilities besides those for
conventional pollutants. As a result, they can remove VOCs, PAHs, and CPM at efficiencies of 55.8–87.6 %,
74.7–89.8 %, and 36.3–81.5 %, respectively, with corresponding emission concentrations of 0.058–16.29 mg/
m3, 0.42–43.3 μg/m3, and 5.9–65.1 mg/m3. Based on current publicly reported data, the VOCs, PAHs and CPM
contents emitted by global coal-fired power plants are estimated to be 88.1 Gg, 6.76 Gg (2.22 Gg in flue gas and
4.54 Gg in fly ash), and 600 Gg (organic components: 328 Gg, inorganic components: 272 Gg), respectively.
Among the many removal technologies reviewed: include improved selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts;
and an advanced oxidation process (AOP) combined with an SCR or with a wet flue gas desulphurization (WFGD)
unit respectively are two potentially useful technologies for future use in CFPPs. The information collected and
presented in this review will help in the formulation of air pollution control policies and the development and
application of efficient removal technologies.

1. Introduction

1.1. Coal consumption and utilization across the world

Coal has been one of the main energy sources used since the 18th
century. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy (2024),
Fig. 1 shows global primary energy consumption for 2013–2023 [1]. It
can be seen that global coal consumption is still growing and will break
through 164 EJ for the first time in 2023, with a corresponding growth
rate of 1.6 %. Coal has continuously accounted for about 25 % of
worldwide primary energy use, making it the second largest source
behind oil. According to the fuel consumption data from 2023, China
continues to be the greatest user of coal globally, with 56 % of the total
coal consumption worldwide. Notably, coal consumption in India is
growing rapidly, with a growth rate of 9.8 %. Its consumption surpassed
that of Europe and North America combined for the first time in 2023,
accounting for 13.4 % of world coal consumption. Following China and
India, the top 10 countries were the US (5.0 %), Japan (2.8 %), Indonesia
(2.6 %), Russian Federation (2.3 %), South Africa (2.0 %), South Korea
(1.6 %), Vietnam (1.4 %), Germany (1.1 %) [1]. To control carbon di-
oxide emissions, Europe and North America have cut back on coal use.
However, constraint by the country-specific energy structures, coal
consumption in the Asia-Pacific region is still showing a rapid growth
trend to meet the growing energy demand. Therefore, the trend of coal
as the primary global energy source will not change in the next decade or
two, especially for China and India [2].

Coal can be used in many industries, such as steel, cement, con-
struction, coal-fired power, coke, coal chemical industry, paper and
textile industries. Of these, power production is the most crucial appli-
cation of coal. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), coal
was projected to remain the main fuel for power generation, accounting
for about 35 % of the world’s total power generation in 2023 [3]. Fig. 2
shows the coal-fired electricity generation and share of electricity in the
top 20 countries [4]. In recent years, as energy systems have become
increasingly electrified, growth in electricity has continued to outpace
growth in total energy demand. Based on statistics from global energy
monitor (GEM), the total installed capacity of coal-fired power genera-
tion in the world was projected to reach 2130 GW by 2023 [5]. The
utilization of coal has played an important role in the development of
the economy and industry of many nations. However, besides the eco-
nomic benefit of utilizing coal, as a source of energy, there is a

significant amount of environmental pollution associated with coal
combustion [6,7]. In order to reduce the environmental pollution caused
by coal burning, governments and the coal industry have taken a variety
of measures. For example, In China, CFPPs equipped with advanced
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices, electrostatic precipitator
(ESP) units, and flue gas desulfurisation (FGD) units with ultra-low
emission technology reduced the emission concentration of NOX, SO2,
(cid:0) 3, respectively [8,
and PM in the flue gas to below 50, 35, and 5 mg/m
9]. In India, in addition to the emission standards of the Environmental
Protection Act of 1986, which requires the installation of pollution
control equipment, the Environmental Protection Agency also stipulates
that the ash content of coal used in CFPPs located more than 1000 km
from the pit head must be less than 34 % [10]. The above measures and
emission policies are mainly aimed at reducing emissions of conven-
tional pollutants (NOX, SO2, and PM). However, coal has a very complex
chemical composition and contains abundant organic matter, which
leads to the production of a variety of organic pollutants during coal
combustion, in addition to the gaseous components mentioned above,
which should be given attention.

1.2. Types and toxicity of organic pollutants

◦

The organic pollutants from coal combustion can be divided into four
groups of compounds: very volatile organic compounds (VVOCs), with a
boiling point range between 0 and 50
C centigrade; volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), with a boiling point range between 50 and 260
C
centigrade; semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), with have a
boiling point range between 260 and 400
C centigrade; and, particulate
organic matter (POMs) [11]. A previous study [12] has shown that most
of the organic matter in coal will be burned and converted into CO2, CO,
and H2O during combustion, but less than 1 % of the organic matter will
escape into the flue gas. These pollutants can be highly toxic, irritant,
teratogenic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic, thus causing great harm to
human health and the ecological natural environment [13,14].

Dichloromethane and vinyl chloride are typical substances in VVOCs
and have been detected in flue gas from several CFPPs. Dichloromethane
is classified as “probably carcinogenic to humans” and its key activation
pathways for cancer induction rely mainly on chromosomal aberrations,
micronuclei and DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, which are associated
with functional glutathione S-transferase (GST) metabolic activity in
tissues and/or species [15]. For the VOCs detected in coal flue gas,
benzene, toluene and ethyl acetate have the highest concentration. This
portion of VOCs alters key biological responses such as cell growth,
apoptosis, and angiogenesis, leading to tumor development and metas-
tasis [16]. In addition, most VOCs are usually carcinogenic, mutagenic
or teratogenic. Detailed information on the hazards of common VOCs in

coal flue gas to human health is summarized in Table S1 (Supporting
Materials). Since the sampling methods of VVOCs and VOCs in flue gas
are similar, the two are usually discussed together. Moreover, the ASTM
D3960-98 standard defines VOCs as any organic compound that can
participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions. This leads to VOCs
and VVOCs being generally referred to as VOCs for analysis.

Due to the high boiling point of SVOCs, they are mainly concentrated
in fly ash and bottom ash (slag), among which PAHs are typical members
of this group of organic compounds produced during coal combustion.
They are polycyclic compounds composed of two or more benzene rings.
Long-term inhalation and exposure to environments containing high
concentrations of PAHs will increase the risk of malignant diseases such
as lung cancer and skin cancer, and will cause lymphatic tissue atrophy
and a decline in immunity [17,18]. Cui et al. [19] detected PAHs and
heavy metals in PM2.5 size fraction released from coal combustion and
found that a proportion of PAHs condenses on the surface of PM2.5,
inducing stronger cytotoxicity and inflammatory effects. Based on the
toxicity of PAHs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
identified 16 PAHs as priority organic pollutants as early as 1976.

◦

Aside from being released directly into the environment as gases or
being present in fly ash and bottom ash, certain organic pollutants
(VOCs and PAHs) also cooperate with a variety of inorganic substances
(SiO2, Fe3O2, CaO, etc.) to form condensable particulate matter (CPM) in
the atmosphere through homogeneous or heterogeneous nuclear modes.
CPM is predominantly present in gaseous form in the flue. Its production
is not significant until the flue gas temperature decreases to around
50
C, which occurs when the gas leaves the chimney (stack). Conse-
quently, the emission of CPM can be easily overlooked. Due to its par-
ticle size often falling within the range of 1–2 μm (belonging to PM2.5
level) [20], CPM can penetrate the human respiratory system, leading to
the development of asthma and cardiovascular disease [21]. Further-
more, the particulate matter formed has the potential to remain in the
atmosphere for an extended period and travel over significant distances.
Consequently, it is imperative to consider the potential hazards of CPM.

1.3. Emission of organic pollutants

According to the emissions database for global atmospheric research
(EDGAR) [22], over the past 40 years, global non-methane volatile
organic compounds (NMVOCs) emissions have increased from 119,000
kt to 169,000 kt, as shown in Fig. 3. From 1970 to 2012, emissions in
North America and Europe halved, while emissions in Africa, China,
India and the rest of Asia increased 2.9, 2.5, 2.2 and 1.8 times, respec-
tively. Currently, Asia and Africa are the main emitters of NMVOCs,
contributing approximately 65 % of the global total [23]. The emission
inventory results indicate that NMVOCs produced by residential

combustion and fuel production account for more than 30 % of the total.
As for the emission statistics of PAHs, data calculated based on the
production capacity of various emission sources and using emission
factors showed that the global emissions of 16 PAHs in 2014 were
510,000 tons. EDGAR gave the emissions of four PAHs, benzo [a] pyrene
(BaP), benzo [b] fluoranthrene (BbF), Benzo [k] fluoranthrene (BkF)
and indene [1,2,3] -cd pyrene (IcdP) during 20190-2018, as shown in
Fig. 4. In 2018, the total emissions of the four PAHs reached 21,263.6
tons (BaP: 7093.7 tons, BbF:7659.9 tons, BkF:29887.9 tons, IcdP:3522.1
tons) [24]. The five sectors of energy production, industry, housing,
transportation and agriculture are the main contributors to PAHs. Wang
et al. [25] used the concentration data of 15,088 PAHs individuals in
943 soil samples collected in China from 2003 to 2020, combined with

PAHs emissions at a resolution of 10 km to perform a meta-analysis. The
results show that the total PAHs emissions in China in 2020 are esti-
mated to be 78,815 tons, which is around 49.6 % of the total energy
produced. In order to deal with organic pollutants produced in the coal
combustion process, many countries have begun to take relevant mea-
sures and to formulate relevant regulations, such as the directive on
ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (2008/50/EC), the in-
dustrial emissions directive (2010/75/EU), and the EU-Decopaint
directive (2004/42/EC), limit the emissions of NMVOCs or the con-
centration of secondary pollutants, for example ozone and particulate
matter [26]. BaP is a representative pollutant of PAHs and is classified as
a Class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC). China’s emission standard (GB16297-1996) states that the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)1012315

J. Liu et al.

emission limit of BaP is 0.0003 mg/m3 [27]. In the European Union
Directive 2004/107/EC, the average annual concentration of BaP does
not exceed 1 ng/m3, prevent and reduce harmful effects of PAHs on
human health and the environment as a whole [28].

Our review of the currently ongoing research showed that much of
the work focused on industrial sources such as printing, papermaking,
and petroleum related operations. The generation and emission char-
acteristics of organic pollutants from industrial sources vary with com-
bustion temperature [29,30], coal preheating and devolatilization rate
[31], and other combustion conditions [32], resulting in different flue
gas compositions, which necessitates the undertaking of more detailed
studies of the organic pollutants generated from combustion processes.
As for the process of coal combustion, there is yet no comprehensive
review of the generation and emission characteristics and control
technology of organic pollutants in CFPPs. Therefore, this review paper
summarizes the relevant literature information about the generated
emissions and the methods used for controlling the organic pollutants
produced from coal combustion.

◦

The formation and transformation of the organic pollutants in the
flue gas as the flue gas passes through the existing air pollutant control
devices (APCDs) in CFPPs is shown in Fig. 5. Emissions from coal
combustion include gaseous products formed during the pyrolysis and
combustion stages. First, the volatiles, mainly organic matter, in the raw
coal escape, some of which are oxidized after reaching their ignition
temperatures. Because of the inherent limitations of the combustion
methods and operating conditions, the combustion efficiency cannot
reach 100 %, resulting in the release of organic materials (VOCs and
PAHs) during combustion, which include a large number of low-
molecular weight compounds, such as benzene compounds and
phenolic compounds [33]. This process is also accompanied by the
decomposition and cyclization of organic compounds released (the
green and yellow portion in Fig. 5). Blazso and Jakab [34] have shown
that phenolic compounds are produced primarily by bond breaking
(dissociation) of the aromatic ether bonds. In addition, the decomposi-
tion of benzene compounds produces phenyls, which are one of the
important precursors of PAHs, since phenyls can produce PAHs via
addition/cyclization (PAC) mechanisms [35,36]. When the VOCs and
PAHs in the flue gas move from the boiler into the SCR device, they will
be oxidized into small molecular compounds such as CO2 and H2O, due
to the higher temperature (~300
C) and the presence of a denitrifica-
tion catalyst (pink portion in Fig. 5). The reduction in the number of
VOCs is supported by a previous study [37], where it was shown that the
total amount of VOCs in the flue gas can be reduced by 80 % after the
SCR device. As the flue gas flows towards the air preheater (APH)
located before the ESP unit, the flue gas temperature drops rapidly to
~110
C, and some organic pollutants condense and are adsorbed on the
fly ash particles (a general term for particulate matter less than PM1 and
up to or greater than 10 μm), which are captured by the ESP (the grey
and blue portion in Fig. 5). The vast majority of PAHs were removed
from the flowing flue gas stream during this process. Li et al. [38] re-
ported that the PAHs concentration in the gas and particulate phases of
the flue gas after WESP decreased from 27.5 to 14.4 mg/m3 to 3.38 and
0.34 mg/m3, respectively. Since SO2 is an undesirable produced during
coal combustion, the flue gas temperature was further reduced to about
50
C in the removal wet flue gas desulphurization (WFGD) device to
remove the SO2. The drop in temperature causes the organic compo-
nents (such as VOCs and PAHs) and inorganic components (such as
Na2SO4, Na3PO4, NaCl, MgSO4, and CaCO3, etc.) in the flue gas to form
CPM through condensation and polymerization. Current research
showed that both WFGD and wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) have
a certain synergistic removal effect on CPM. Song et al. [39] showed that
the removal efficiency of WFGD and WESP for organic components in
CPM was 32.5 % and 10.4 %, respectively. This is mainly attributed to
the washing effect of WFGD and the dusting effect of WESP. However,
after the flue gas passes through the APCDs, residual organic pollutants
(VOCs, PAHs, and CPM) are discharged into the atmosphere from the

◦

◦

stack. Some scholars have tested the emission concentrations of organic
pollutants from the stack of CFPPs and found that the emission con-
centrations of VOCs and PAHs were generally lower than 20 mg/m3 and
5 μg/m3 respectively, accounting for less than 1 % of the coal pyrolysis
release [40,41]. The CPM emission concentration exceeded 10 mg/m3,
accounting for more than 50 % of the total amount of PM [39].
Considering that the amount of coal-fired flue gas emissions is large, the
emission of organic pollutants cannot be ignored.

CFPPs generally implement controls to meet the applicable industrial
point source, exhaust emission standards. A variety of methods and
technologies for controlling organic pollutants have been developed,
including the use of adsorption materials, catalytic oxidation, plasma
degradation, and biological degradation, which are some of the tech-
nologies that have been used and studied extensively. Several studies
have shown that existing APCDs in coal power plants can not only
effectively remove NOX, SO2, and PM, but also synergistically remove
organic pollutants [38,43]. Therefore, this review paper summarizes the
existing flue gas pollutant control equipment used to control organic
pollutants and potential control concepts that can aid in the develop-
ment of new control technologies for the removal of coal-fired organic
pollutants. The information is presented in an order that will help the
reader formulate air pollution control policies based on the available
technologies. Also, the information could help in identifying where the
development and application of efficient removal technologies are still
needed. There are five sections in this review in addition to the intro-
duction. They are as follows.

2. Formation mechanism of organic compounds from coal
combustion

Coal combustion involves the evolution of volatile components of
coal by pyrolysis and the oxidation of the resulting gaseous materials
[44]. The pyrolysis and combustion processes occur almost simulta-
neously. In order to understand the release mechanism of volatile
organic compounds during coal combustion, the structure and type of
organic compounds in coal and the pyrolysis and combustion gases
produced need to be analyzed. During the sampling of organic pollutants
from coal combustion, the material collected could be in the form of a
gas, a liquid, or a solid phase. Thus, the sampling technique and analysis
method used to collect a test sample from the different locations in a
CFPP can be most challenging. In the following section, several analyt-
ical methods used for collecting a test sample will be reviewed. The
mode of occurrence of organic matter in coal and the emission charac-
teristics of organic pollutants during coal combustion will also be
presented.

2.1. Analysis method

In a CFPP, organic pollutants are not only emitted into the envi-
ronment with the flue gas, but are also found in the bottom ash, in the fly
ash captured by the ESP, and in the desulphurization wastewater. In
order to obtain accurate emission data of the organic pollutants, it is
necessary to understand the limitations of the analytical methods used
for analyzing the samples collected.

For gas-phase organics analysis, spectrum analysis (such as differ-
ential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) [45], Fourier transform
spectroscopy (FTIR) [46], and tuneable diode laser absorption spec-
troscopy (TDLAS) [47]), chromatography (GC), and mass spectrometry
(MS) and their combined techniques (such as GC-MS, FTIR-MS, and
FTIR-GC-MS) are used.

For liquid-phase organics analysis, the detection methods such as GC,
GC-MS, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and LC-MS
are used. Compared with the analysis of the organic matter in the gas
phase, the analysis of organic matter in the liquid phase requires pre-
treatment of the sample, including separation of the water content,
and the concentration of the organic matter. The extraction methods
mainly include headspace technology (HT) [48], liquid-phase extraction
(LPE) [49], solid phase microextraction (SPME) [50], and liquid phase
microextraction (LLMP) [51].

The determination of organic matter in solid samples involves the
same general approach used for determining organics in the liquid
phase. The organic matter is first extracted from a solid sample into a
solution before being subjected to analysis, mainly by GC-MS. However,
considering the complex organic composition, low concentration, and
other factors a solid sample has to go through a complex pre-treatment
preparation process. At present, LPE, SE, and accelerated solvent
extraction (ASE) are commonly used extraction methods for the pre-
treatment of solid samples (coal, ash and slag) collected from CFPPs
[52–54].

Fig. 6 shows the measurement range and time/chemical resolution of
commonly used analytical methods such as the GC-MS. For on-line
measurements, the GC-FID/TCD/PID methods shows much higher
chemical resolution than the FTIR method. For off-line measurements
the LC-MS/HPLC combination demonstrates the highest chemical reso-
lution and measurement range for organic compounds. Details of the
analytical methods (including the test procedures, detection limits, re-
covery rates) are organized in the Supporting Materials (Appendix I).

depends on a number of factors such as the physical and chemical
characteristics of the coal, which are a function of the age, source, and
composition of the coal [56,57]. Other factors include the combustion
method [32], coal particle size [58], excess air coefficient [59], and
residence time in a combustion chamber [31]. Coal can be viewed as a
macromolecular structure consisting of fused aromatic ring groups, in
which the repeating units or “monomers” consist of polycyclic moieties
[60]. The “monomers” are linked to one another by various bridges, for
example, aliphatic, ester, carbonyl, thio, and amine bonds. These
bridges are easily cleaved during coal pyrolysis to form organic com-
pounds for release [61]. Therefore, the organic matter emitted from a
coal combustion process originates from the organic matter contained in
the coal, and from the chemical reaction between different elements
under the complex reaction conditions in the combustion unit. Under-
standing the transformation of organic matter in coal is the basis for
predicting the emission characteristics of organic pollutants in the
combustion process.

Therefore, determining the organic matters in coal is important and
this is achieved using suitable extractants and efficient extraction
methods. Traditional organic solvents include tetrahydrofuran (THF),
CCl4, CS2, and CH2Cl2, and the extraction efficiency is affected by the
polarity of solvent and the interaction between functional groups in coal
and solvent. Zhang et al. [62] used THF, methanol (MT), ethyl acetate
(EA), and dichloromethane (DCM) as solvents to extract Shenfu coal
mine in China and analyzed the leachate by GC-MS. The results showed
that the solvent extraction efficiency was in the order of THF > EA > MT
> DCM, all four solvents had an extraction yield lower than 1.5 % of the
total mass of coal. Due to the low extraction efficiency of a single sol-
vent, the comprehensive composition of the organic matter in a coal
sample cannot be obtained. Therefore, Zhou and Shi [63] used a mixture
of toluene/ethanol as the leachate (solvent) to extract the organic matter
in Xinjiang coal by an ultrasonic method, and analyzed the leachate
using a GC-MS. A total of 63 organic compounds, accounting for 3.1 % of
the total mass of coal, were detected, including 18 aliphatic hydrocar-
bons, 28 aromatic hydrocarbons and 14 organic hybrid compounds.
Zong et al. [64] reported that the organic matter in Ordos coal from
China that was extracted with CS2/THF solvent mixture reached in some
cases 6.5 % of the mass of the sample. And, by using a silica gel column
in a GC they were able to isolate a series of long chain n-alkanes,
monoaromatic gonanes and PAHs. However, other methods such as
Soxhlet extraction (SE), microwave extraction, ultrasonic extraction

were tested and found to more effectively extract the organic matter in
solids. Yan et al. [65] extracted Qingshan bituminous coal by SE using
CH2Cl2 as the solvent and found that the proportion of long-chain hy-
drocarbons was the highest group extracted, accounting for more than
60 % by mass of the total extracted mass of organic matter, the content
of PAHs was nearly 30 %, whereas the content of the benzene series in
the extracted material was relatively low (less than 10 %). Furthermore,
the results of Zhang et al. [62] showed that the yield of microwave
assisted extraction (MAE) was 3.14, 2.24, 2.61, and 1.71 times more
efficient than a conventional thermal extraction method when tetrahy-
drofuran, methanol, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate were used as
solvents, respectively. They also indicated that THF can extract more
polar compounds and that its solution is rich in highly condensed
polycyclic aromatic compounds with high number of rings. And this
specific performance of THF is related to its strong interaction with the
C-O bond of the material being extracted. In contrast, ethyl acetate
showed strong interaction with the C=O bond and was able to extract
low-polarity compounds, especially polycyclic aromatic compounds
with two aromatic rings and aliphatic compounds with long alkane
chains. Li et al. [55] used GC/MS and GC/Q-TOF-MS to analyze six
thermal dissolution (TD) extracts and found 405 and 815 compounds,
respectively, with a yield that could reach up to 24 %. The distribution of
the organic compounds identified in their study is shown in Fig. 7.
Arenes, alkanes, phenols and alkenes are the four major groups that
were extracted in the samples. Current studies showed that the extrac-
tion efficiency of polar solvent is generally higher than that of non-polar

et al. [73]).

solvents [66]. In addition, the TD extraction method can result in a
higher yield of organic molecules while maintaining the stability of the
substance being extracted [67,68]. This is mainly due to the high tem-
perature conditions, which effectively weakens the force between small
molecules and the coal skeletal structure, so that more organic mole-
cules are dissolved by the extractant.

From the above studies, it can be found that PACs (including PAHs)
are one of the most important organic compounds extracted from coal.
In addition, due to their strong carcinogenicity, EPA regulated 16 pri-
ority pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (EPA-PAHs), which
are usually composed of 2–6 concentrated aromatic rings [57]. There-
fore, in recent years, the EPA-16 PAHs in coal have received special
attention in environmental research. The concentrations of PAHs in coal
around the world are summarized in Table S2. The total concentration of
PAHs and EPA-PAHs extracted from coal varied between 14 and 2090
μg/g and 6–253 μg/g, respectively. A review of PAHs concentration
distribution of in different ranks of coal indicates that PAHs increases for
the lower rank order and reaches the highest level for bituminous coal.
Then, it decreases as the maturity of anthracite coal further increases.
The relationship between the total concentration of PAHs and coal rank
given by Achten and Hofmann [57] are in support of this trend, as shown
in Fig. 8. Laumann et al. [56] reviewed the PAHs concentrations in coal
from 11 coal basins around the world, and indicated that Germany,
Sydney, Indonesia and Ukraine had the highest concentrations of PAHs
in coal, with a random vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of about 1 %. The above
results indicate that the occurrence and distribution of PAHs in coal
largely depend on factors such as coal rank. This suggests that the choice
of coal used to fire a coal combustor will determine the types and con-
centrations of organic pollutant emissions. And, with the aid of the
presently available analytical tools we can identify the composition of
the organic matter in coal samples and thus estimate the organic emis-
sions from of coal-fired stationary sources.

2.3. Formation and emission characteristics of organic pollutants during
coal pyrolysis

◦

◦

Coal combustion involves the pyrolysis of coal and combustion of the
emitted volatiles. Therefore, pyrolysis is an important initial stage of the
coal combustion process. In order to study the release mechanism of
organic compounds in coal combustion, the composition and content of
organic compounds in pyrolysis gas have been studied extensively.
Temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the pyrolysis
process and early studies show that the pyrolysis process of coal occurs
in three stages [69,70]: (1) the first stage is a low-temperature range
(below 300
C), mainly releasing inorganic small molecules; (2) the
second stage is the medium temperature range (300–600
C), which is
the main reaction temperature range for pyrolysis, and almost all the
aliphatic and the aromatic volatile organic compounds are released. (3)
the third stage is defined by the high-temperature range (>600
C), in
which only H2O, CO,CO2, and methane are released. Li et al. [71]
studied the pyrolysis process of 13 types of coals and measured by
GC/MS the evolution of the H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, some aliphatic, and
aromatic hydrocarbons released at the exit of STA 429 simultaneous
thermal analyzer operated at a rate of 10
C.
In order to obtain more detailed information on the organic compounds
evolved during pyrolysis, Fern ́andez et al. [72] used TD-GC/MS to
conduct a quantitative analysis of the volatile organic compounds of the
pyrolysis gaseous emissions from four coal samples at 400
C. Twelve
VOCs were detected and their concentration varied between 35.3 and
129.6 μg/g, among which benzene, toluene and decane accounted for a
high proportion of the aromatics. However, most of organic compounds
were released at temperatures above 400
C during coal pyrolysis.
Although TD-GC/MS can analyze the type and concentration of organic
compounds released at specific temperatures, it could not produce a
complete analysis of organic compound release due to sampling time
constraints (<10 s). This limitation can be overcome by using a

TG-FTIR-GC/MS to comprehensively analyze the VOCs evolved at
different temperature stages. In that study, Cheng et al. [73] were able to
identify a total of 124 organic compounds, indicating that the pro-
portions of alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and phenols were
36.5 %, 15.5 %, 33.0 % and 15.0 %, respectively. The VOCs were mainly
C, as shown in Fig. 9. With increase in
released between 300
temperature within this temperature range, the alkanes (CnH2n+2, n > 1)
and aromatic hydrocarbon (BTEX) reached a maximum value at around
C, whereas the concentration of the CH4 reached its maximum
520
value closer to 600
C. Gao et al. [69] also discussed the influence of
temperature on the characteristic of PAHs released during coal pyrolysis
in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) reactor. They found that the
concentration of the released total PAHs showed a tendency to increase
first and then decrease from 400
C, and reached the
◦
maximum at 800
C. In addition, the PAHs with a low number of ben-
zene rings (generally less than three) were mainly detected at temper-
C whereas the PAHs with high number of rings were
atures below 800
detected at temperatures above 800

C to 1200

C.

In addition to temperature being the key factor affecting the release
of organic compounds during the pyrolysis process, factors such as coal-
type [74], residence time [70,75], heating rate [73], and pressure [76]
also play an important role. Yan et al. [33] investigated the effect of coal
rank on the distribution of PAHs and phenolic compounds during coal
pyrolysis of different coals by Py-GC/MS. They found that the number of
PAHs released from bituminous coal was greater than that of the coking
coal, while the number of phenols released was lower. The released
amounts of PAHs and phenols were closely related to the structure of
coal. Yan et al. [33] also concluded that PAHs were formed not only by
the thermal decomposition of the coal structure, but also by the com-
bination of different low-molecular weight organic compounds. The
amount of phenol, cresol and Xylenol formed should be closely related to
the type of free radicals (such as -H and -CH3) and the chemical structure
of aromatic carbon containing oxygen available during coal pyrolysis.
Kong et al. [77] also monitored the formation of four kinds of phenolic
compounds during the rapid coal pyrolysis process, finding that the
concentration of phenolic substances produced from lignite coal was
higher than that of bituminous coal and anthracite coal. They also
indicated that the main source of phenols is from the thermal decom-
position of oxygen-containing structures, especially aryl ethers, rather
than the volatilization of phenols already present in raw coal. Therefore,
the difference in the chemical structure of coal is the main reason for the
different composition of organic products in coal pyrolysis.

Dong et al. [78] used GC/MS and PY-GC/MS to compare the con-
centrations of the EPA-16 PAH: in raw coal by extraction using CH2Cl2 as
the solvent, in the pyrolysis gaseous stream, and in fly ash. They found
that the concentration of PAH in the pyrolysis gaseous stream was much
higher than that of the free PAHs – extracted from raw coal. The main
source of PAHs in the gaseous stream was from the complex chemical
reactions that occurred during coal pyrolysis, in which high-cyclic PAHs
were easily decomposed into low-cyclic PAHs. Haiping et al. [76]
studied the influence of pressure on the release of organic matter during
the pyrolysis of bituminous coal using a pressurized TGA combined with
an ambient thermogravimetric analyzer. They found that increasing the
pressure from 0.1 MPa to 5 MPa reduced the amount of released organic
matter, but the total output of coke was increased. Similar results have
been reported by Gong et al. [79] study. They also pointed out that coal
particle size has a direct effect on the composition of organic matter in
effluents produced by thermal desorption. Coal with large particles
(0.9–1 mm) released more monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs)
and PAHs than small coal pulverized particles (120–140 μm), and the
content of aliphatic compounds was lower. It is worth noting that the
coal particle size and environmental pressure had little influence on the
lignite pyrolysis process [79,80].

In summary, coal pyrolysis was the first stage of the coal combustion
process. The releases of VOCs and of PAHs increases first and then
decrease with increasing temperature, reaching their maximum values

◦

C and 800

at around 600
C, respectively. Higher pressure and smaller
coal particles can reduce the release of organic compounds. Analysis of
such results for a coal can help to reveal the formation mechanism of the
organic pollutants and in calculating the balance of the organic pollutant
emissions during coal combustion.

2.4. Formation and emission characteristics of organic pollutants during
coal combustion

The coal combustion process can be described in general as a
chemical reaction between combustible matter released during the py-
rolysis process and the oxygen present in the air stream. In theory, when
the combustion efficiency is assumed to be 100 % all the combustible
matter in coal will be oxidized forming CO2, H2O, SO2, and other
gaseous oxides, in amounts reflecting their stoichiometric proportions of
the elements in the coal. However, in practice, the combustion efficiency
cannot reach the ideal condition due to the limitations of the combustion
conditions and combustion equipment used [81,82]. This is the main
reason why organic pollutants are produced during coal combustion,
some of which are released beyond any applied emission controls. The
amount and nature of the emissions released will depend on factors such
as, whether the setup is of an industrial scale or laboratory scale, the coal
type and size, the combustion temperature, and the excess air coeffi-
cient. Therefore, the influence of these factors on the formation and
release of organic pollutants was investigated in several studies. In the
following section a summary of some studies on the generation and
emission characteristics of PAHs and VOCs is provided for work un-
dertaken in laboratory-scale combustors.

PAHs are one of the main components detected in the pyrolysis gas
from coal. Due to their strong toxicity and increasingly strict emission
regulations, many scholars have carried out studies on the formation
mechanism and emission characteristics of PAHs from coal combustion.
In order to clarify the emission characteristics of PAHs, it is particularly
important to make clear the sources of PAHs. At present, the possible
sources of PAHs during coal combustion are: (1) Free state PAHs
occurring in the original coal that can be extracted directly using an
extractant; (2) Other PAHs are formed by a complex chemistry involving
organics compounds and other species formed during the coal pyrolysis
stage. The evolution of the free state PAHs is mainly controlled by the
type of coal. As shown in Table S2, the content of free PAHs in bitumi-
nous coal is relatively high. The second source of PAHs is mainly
determined by the coal volatile content and combustion conditions. The
higher the volatile content, the more organic free radicals are produced
at high temperatures, which promotes the generation of PAHs. However,
as the volatile content continues to increase, the degree of aromatization
of coal decreases, weakening the combination of aromatic rings and free
radicals to generate PAHs [44], which explains why of the coals studied
[83,84], bituminous coal combustion released the highest amount of
PAHs.

Compared with the first type of PAHs, the formation of the second
type of PAHs is more complicated, some of which involve the addition
and cyclization of precursors generated from coal pyrolysis. For
example, Dong et al. [85] elucidated the formation path of PAHs
through hydrogen abstraction/acetylene addition (HACA) mechanisms.
In this reaction scheme, the combustion temperature plays an important
factor influencing the amount of PAHs emitted during coal combustion.
Yan et al. [30] investigated the PAHs emission during coal combustion
◦
at different temperatures from 600
C. Their results showed
that the concentration of PAHs increased with the increase in temper-
ature from 600 to 800
C, while the opposite occurred in the tempera-
ture range from 800 to 1000
C. The reason for the increased
concentration of PAHs was attributed to the reaction steps occurring
during the pyrolysis process generating PAHs. However, as the tem-
perature was increased above 800
C molecular cleavage of PAHs
intensified, as a result, the concentration of released PAHs detected
decreased. Temperature also plays a crucial role in altering the

distribution of the number of rings in the PAHs detected. At the low
temperature stage, the PAHs detected had mainly a large number of
rings (>4 rings), mainly attributed to the free state PAHs released during
coal pyrolysis. However, at high temperature, due to the C-C bond
fracture of the large aromatics, relatively more of the three- and
four-ring PAHs were formed, as evidenced by the increase in the pro-
portion of tricyclic and tetracyclic PAHs to the total PAHs. Similar re-
sults were also reported by Han et al. [86], who also indicated that the
composition of PAH emissions varied during different combustion pro-
cesses. They postulated that a large number of LPAHs (low-molecule--
weight PAHs) were synthesized through the HACA pathway during
rapid flame combustion when the oxygen content was relatively low.
With the increase in combustion temperature, a large number of HPAHs
(high-molecule-weight PAHs) were synthesized later during the com-
bustion stage. Therefore, in order to have a clearer understanding of
PAHs generation and emission characteristics during coal combustion,
factors such as coal composition, combustion mode and combustion
parameters would need to be considered.

Currently, there are only a few studies on the generation and emis-
sion characteristics of VOCs in which laboratory scale coal combustors
were used. One such study was conducted by Cai et al. [87] who used
PTR-TOF-MS to identify online the concentration of non-methane
organic compounds (NMOCs) at different coal combustion stages
(ignition, flaming, smoldering, and embers) at the exit of a stainless-steel
chamber. The concentration curve for NMOCs released at the outlet of
the reactor in Fig. S1 (a) shows double peaks occurring over time, which
is mainly attributed to the rapid release of hydrocarbons from coal due
to the high temperatures generated during the ignition and combustion
stages. Fig. S1 (c) shows the distribution of NMOCs released during
different combustion stages, indicating that the NMOCs released in the
first two stages are similar in composition to the hydrocarbons from coal
pyrolysis. As the combustion process progresses, the percentage of
carboxyl and acid compounds increases, whereas the hydrocarbons are
rapidly consumed by oxidation, as indicated by the decrease in their
percentages. Cai et al. [87] also compared the combustion of bituminous
coal with anthracite and observed a similar trend, with NMOCs being
released during the ignition and combustion stages between 64 and 88
% of total NMOCs emissions.

To further clarify the generation and release mechanism of VOCs
during industrial coal burning, the distribution of the VOCs produced
◦
C/min), a drop-tube furnace
from a fixed-bed flow reactor (100
C/s), and an on-site boiler (105 ◦
(2000
C/s), as a result coal is exposed
to three different heating rates [31]. In the fixed-bed reactor, a total of
33 kinds of VOCs were produced by the coal combustor, including 11
alkane compounds, 8 olefin compounds, 12 aromatic compounds and 2
phenol compounds (Fig. S2 (a)). Compared with the pyrolysis process,
no new VOCs were found. In the drop-tube furnace, the effects of tem-
perature, residence time and heating rate were investigated. The results
showed that the concentration of VOCs increased with the increase in
heating rate, while the concentration of halogenated hydrocarbons
increased slightly with a decrease in excess air ratio, as shown in Fig. S2
(b) and S2 (c). This indicates that determining the appropriate furnace
temperature and increasing the residence time in the boiler or flue gas is
beneficial for reducing VOCs emissions. In the field test on which a 300
MW CFPP was used, ten VOCs were detected, most of which were re-
sidual VOCs in the pyrolysis escape gas. Because during combustion the
rate of temperature rise in the 300 MW unit was rapid and the com-
bustion efficiency was higher than that of the droplet furnace, the re-
sidual volatile organic compound content was lower than that of the
droplet furnace, but similar to the droplet furnace simulation. Also, a
small amount of newly generated chlorinated hydrocarbons were
formed in the 300 MW unit.

From the above studies, differences in the skeletal aromatic struc-
ture, side chain substituents (hydroxyl, carboxyl, amine, and thiol
groups), and inter-monomer connections (aliphatic, ester, carbonyl,
sulfur, and amine bonds) directly determine differences in organic

pollutant emissions during combustion. For example, bituminous coal
has a high content of free PAHs and a rich aromatic structure, which
facilitate the formation of PAHs, leading to a high content of PAHs in the
combustion products. Lignite has a low degree of aromatization and is
rich in oxygen-containing aromatic carbon, resulting in a high content of
phenolic substances in the combustion products.

From the above studies, differences in the skeletal aromatic struc-
ture, side chain substituents (hydroxyl, carboxyl, amine, and thiol
groups), and inter-monomer connections (aliphatic, ester, carbonyl,
sulfur, and amine bonds) directly determine differences in organic
pollutant emissions during combustion. For example, bituminous coal
has a high content of free PAHs and a rich aromatic structure, which
facilitate the formation of PAHs, leading to a high content of PAHs in the
combustion products. Lignite has a low degree of aromatization and is
rich in oxygen-containing aromatic carbon, resulting in a high content of
phenolic substances in the combustion products.

Pyrolysis is the initial stage of coal combustion, many organic
compounds (mainly hydrocarbons) and free radicals (-H, -CH3) are
released from the coal main body by bond breaking and reaction of the
organic compounds generated. As the combustion process progresses, a
large number of organic compounds are consumed, and the number of
oxidized forms of hydrocarbons increases, but at the same time, acid and
lipid substances are generated. Therefore, the factors specific to the coal
used, which determine the organic pollutants released during coal
combustion include: the original coal composition, structure of coal, and
the amount of organic compounds released during pyrolysis. An
important external factors is the oxidation efficiency of the combustion
process. However, pyrolysis and combustion of coal are two interde-
pendent and mutually influential processes, and it is necessary to
comprehensively analyze the impact of the three on the emission of
organic pollutants. Research and theoretical studies on the effect of coal
type, combustion temperature, residence time, load, excess air ratio, and
other combustion conditions, such as that presented here, should be
helpful when providing technical support for the reduction of organic
pollutants from CFPPs.

3. Sampling of organic pollutants in coal-fired stationary
sources

◦

Compared with gas sampling in an atmospheric environment,
obtaining a representative sample during on-site sampling of a coal-fired
flue gas is a more difficult task. The characteristic high temperature,
high dust, and high humidity of coal-fired flue gas are factors that can
affect the accuracy of sampling. This is mainly due to the inhibiting
effect of high temperature and of high humidity on the adsorption
performance of an adsorbent and the blockage with along the pipeline,
resulting in the organic pollutants in the flue gas not being completely
captured. For temperature, the highest temperature observed within the
sampling sites is recorded at the SCR unit, ranging from 260
C to
380
C, which is determined by the boiler load. As for dust, the particle
concentration prior to entering the ESP often surpasses 1000 mg/m3. In
terms of humidity, the flue gas after passing through the FGD system
typically exhibits a humidity level exceeding 80 %. Higher flue gas
temperature requires special materials for the sampling probe and that
the sampling gas path be air tight. The dust (particles) and water vapor
in the flue gas need to be removed before a sample is collected. This
undoubtedly increases the complexity of the sampling procedure. In
addition, the diversity of organic pollutants in coal-fired flue gas makes
it difficult for one sampling method to analyze the complete spectrum of
components. Therefore, it is necessary to select the most suitable sam-
pling method according to the target components, which is particularly
important for obtaining accurate emission data.

◦

mainly divided into on-site sampling with online analysis and offline
analysis of a pre-collected sample. On-line analysis sampling includes: 1)
direct interface sampling online analysis and 2) interface dilution online
analysis, such as EPA Method 18 [88], Method 25A [89], and Method
25B [90]. Off-line analysis sampling methods, which mainly include: a)
sampling by gas canisters or bag filters and b) sampling by adsorption
tubes such as EPA TO-1 [91], TO-2 [92], TO-17 [93], and EPA Method
25 [94]. The different sampling methods and target compounds are
summarized in Table S3. A short description of the methods is given
next.

3.1.1. Direct docking sampling

The concentration of organic pollutants emitted by a CFPP is
generally lower than the detector range, so there is no need to dilute the
flue gas before sampling. The system diagram for direct docking sam-
pling is given in EPA Method 18, and is shown in Fig. S3 (a). The sam-
pling system consists of a sampling probe, heating box, gas circuit
system, and analytical system. A detailed description of the direct
connection sampling method, sampling process, analysis method,
quality assurance, and quality control (QA/QC) are organized in the
Supporting Materials (Appendix II).

3.1.2. Adsorption tube sampling

Adsorption tube sampling, as recommended by the National Institute
of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), involves the use of adsor-
bents (activated carbon, Tenax® GC, XAD-2) to capture specific organic
compounds, which are then identified and quantified by gas chroma-
tography after solvent extraction or thermal desorption. In addition,
EPA Methods TO-1, TO-2, TO-3 [95] recommend additional procedures
for capturing and analyzing VOCs having a range of volatilities. In the
first EPA Method, Tenax® GC is used as the adsorbent, in the second
method carbon molecular sieve (CMS) is used as the adsorbent, and in
the third method a collection trap made of a stainless-steel tubing filled
with silanized glass microbead, which is placed in a cryogenic atmo-
sphere to collect highly volatile compounds ((cid:0) 10
C). However,
the capture efficiency of an adsorption tube used to collect the gaseous
organics in the flue gas is easily affected by temperature and humidity.
In order to avoid the interference of high temperature, high humidity,
and high particulates in the flue gas one can use the EPA Method
0030/0031 system for which the diagram of the VOCs sampling system
is shown in Fig. S3 (b). The sampling system consists of a sampling
probe, a condensing system, a capture system and an exhaust gas
treatment system. A detailed description of the adsorption tube sam-
pling, sampling process, analysis method, and QA/QC are organized in
the Supporting Materials (Appendix II).

The available opportunity for taking a sample in an industrial setting
such as a CFPP is limited by the maintenance schedule of an industrial
unit. Because meeting the requirements of EPA Method 0030/0031 is
time consuming and can involve the cleaning of pipes and the use of
collision machines, as well as the replacement of adsorbents, the stan-
dard EPA system used in our previous study [37] was slightly modified
to address the above issues, as shown in Fig. S3 (c). Four modifications
were done to EPA Methods 0030/0031: (1) The sampling probe was
replaced by the sampling probe used in EPA Method 17. A filter car-
tridge in the pre-filter was used to collect the particles in the flue gas and
both the amounts and the distribution of organic pollutants adsorbed on
the particles were then determined; (2) The condensing system used to
cool the flue gases, which also removed the moisture in the flue gases
was replaced by a Nafion tube; (3) A multi-stage adsorption tube filled
with adsorbent was used to expand the range of the target organic
matter; and, (4) An oxygen display was added for real-time monitoring
of air tightness of sampling system.

Integrated bag sampling

Currently, the sampling of VOCs emissions in the exhaust gas is

lecting VOCs in the exhaust gas from stationary sources. Similar

sampling requirements to those in Method 18 are also provided in the
equivalent - China’s Method HJ 734–2014. The bag sampling device is a
combination of a Tedlar air bag (made of PTFE) or Mylar aluminized bag
and a rigid vacuum fixed box. Sampling of the exhaust air is carried out
using a sampling system consisting of a quick connector, vacuum con-
necting pipe, and PTFE sample connecting pipe. The bag material re-
quirements, sampling process, analysis methods, and QA/QC of the bag
sampling method are organized in the Supporting Materials. (Appendix
II).

3.1.4. Canister sampling

The canister sampling system is similar to the bag sampling system,
except that the samples are collected in purified steel tanks (usually
summa canisters). Samples are collected in a certified passivated steel
canister that is evacuated to approximately (cid:0) 30 inches of Mercury.
Samples may be collected either as grab samples or as temporal samples
and the sampling times can be changed from less than 1 min to greater
than 24 h, by using a flow restricting device. TO-15 was developed for
the sampling and analysis of VOCs in ambient air [96]. The QA/QC
requirements for canister sampling are summarized in the Supporting
Materials. (Appendix II).

In summary, the current sampling methods for VOCs in stationary
source flue gases are diverse. The most widely used method for
measuring the total organic component in the industrial environment is
by using on-line analysis sampling. To identify the organic components
in a sample, the off-line analysis sampling method would need to be
combined with a GC-MS. When the off-line sampling method is used and
the exhaust gas temperature, humidity, polarity, and concentration of
organic matter would need to be taken into consideration. At present,
both the bag sampling method and the Summa canister sampling
method are used to sample at the stack of a CFPP. However, since the
flue gas at the SCR sampling points in a CFPP has a high temperature and
a high concentration of both particulate matter and NOx, there are
limitations to the application of the bag and canister sampling methods.
However, the adsorption tube sampling method is not limited by sam-
pling volume and can be used for a wide range of VOC concentrations
and at temperatures below 300
C in CFPPs. In addition, the method is
more transportable than the bag and canister sampling method, which is
another advantage.

◦

3.2. PAHs sampling

EPA Method 0010 provides a sampling method for SVOCs in gaseous
and particulate phases, which can be used for sampling PAHs, as shown
in Fig. S4. Similar sampling requirements are included in China’s
Method HJ 646–2013 and South Korea’s Method KNJ 23. The sampling
system in EPA Method 0010 consists of a sampling probe, a particle
filter, an adsorber, an impingement box, and a metering console. The
flue gases are sampled at a constant rate via a sampling probe, the
particulate-phase PAHs in the flue gases are collected by a glass fiber
filter, and the gas-phase PAHs are captured by the XAD-2 resin bed in the
adsorber. The impinger chamber is made up of four 500 mL Greenberg-
Smith impingers designed to remove the water content in the flue gas.
The first two impinger bottles are usually filled with a pre-determined
amount of water, whereas the third can be left empty or can be filled
with a pre-determined amount of sodium hydroxide solution to remove
hydrochloric acid, and the fourth is filled with a known amount (mass)
of silica gel. In order to ensure that no PAHs are lost during the sampling
process, the sampling probe and filter are heated to 120
C, while the
flue gas temperature at the sorbent trap inlet is reduced to 20
C to
ensure a high adsorption efficiency of PAHs by the bed of XAD-2 resin.
The PAHs captured by the membrane filter and adsorbent were extrac-
ted by a SE apparatus with dichloromethane for 22 ± 2 h, and the PAHs
remaining in the impingement bottles were washed with n-hexane. The
obtained extracts were analyzed by GC-MS. The concentration of PAHs
collected by the membrane filter provides a measure of the PAH

attached to particles such as soot, whereas the concentration of PAHs in
the gaseous phase was that portion extracted from the sorbent and the
impinger bottles. The collected samples are then stored in a dark cold
C, and the analysis needs to
storage location, at temperatures below 4
be completed within 30 days.

◦

3.3. CPM sampling

EPA Method 202 provides the CPM sampling procedure for the wet
impinger cooling method and the dry impinger cooling method
respectively [97], as shown in Fig. S5 (a) and (b). The wet impinger
cooling sampling system is composed of the sampling assembly (EPA
Method 5\ Method 17\ Method 201), a condenser, an impinger box, and
an air channelling system. The impinger box consists of four impingers
placed in an ice bath. The first three impingers are loaded with 100 mL
of deionized water to collect condensable particles in the flue gas. The
fourth impinger is loaded with 200~300 g of silica gel to protect the
pump and is used to calculate the moisture content of the flue gas. The
CPM filter system is placed between the second and third impinger.
Organic and inorganic components of the CPM are collected from the
condenser, impinger box, the connecting pipes, and the CPM filters
(shown in red box). EPA Method 202 provides the procedures that must
be followed for measuring both organic and inorganic CPM from sta-
tionary emission sources. The details of the steps for calculating CPM are
provided in the Supporting Materials (Appendix III).

Compared with the wet impinger cooling method, the dry impinger
cooling method is an improvement and can be optimized mainly by
using dry impinger bottles. The main differences between the wet and
dry impinger cooling methods are as follows: (1) the spiral condensing
pipe is added before the impingers, which can increase the heat transfer
area and the residence time of flue gas in the sampling system, resulting
in an improvement in the amount of condensed material; (2) The first
two of the three wet impingers are replaced by two dry impingers
(empty), which reduces the interference of the water-soluble gases such
as sulfur dioxide; and (3) A posterior filter membrane was added to
improve the capture efficiency of CPM. The results of field sampling
show that the CPM concentration measured by dry impinger cooling
method is more accurate than the wet impinger cooling method.

Several areas in EPA Method 202 need improvement to reduce biases
in the test method for measuring the amount of CPM [98,99]: There is a
need to: (1) reduce the effect of water-soluble gases such as sulfur di-
oxide, thereby improving the accuracy of the test method; (2) improve
the applicability of the test method for sampling flue gases with high
humidity and at low temperature; (3) increase the filter film’s collection
efficiency for the CPM; and, (4) reduce the CPM wall losses.

In addition to the dry and wet impinger cooling method, dilution
cooling methods are often used for CPM sampling, such as EPA Method
CTM-039 [100], which expands on the measurement capabilities of EPA
Method 201A, by adding a dilution cooling apparatus and other items.
The procedure involves isokinetic sampling of flue gases, which then
passes through two cyclone separators for PM10 and PM2.5. After exiting
the cyclones, the flue gas velocity is maintained. Particles smaller than
2.5 μm are directed through a heated sampling probe and a Venturi tube
into a mixing chamber where they are diluted and cooled with dry,
purified air. Complete cooling of CPM occurs in the residence chamber,
and particulates are ultimately collected on the inner walls of the tubing
and at the exit filter membrane. During sampling, it is crucial to monitor
the temperature of the filter membrane at the tubing exit, maintaining it
below 29.5
C by regulating the temperature of the dilution air. After
sampling, the cyclone separators, sampling probe, Venturi tube, con-
necting pipelines, and tubing interiors are washed with acetone. The
mixing and residence chambers, as well as the filter inlet, are sequen-
tially rinsed with deionized water and acetone, followed by drying and
constant weighing of all wash solutions and the filter membrane.

The operating principle of this method entails diluting and cooling

channel until the temperature of the mixed gases equilibrates with the
ambient air temperature [101]. Compared with the impinger cooling
method, the dilution cooling method is believed to simulates better the
CPM formation process in the actual atmospheric environment. In
addition, this method avoids the supersaturation of water vapor and
cooling into water to absorb water-soluble gases such as SO2 and HCl.
Therefore, the sampling results are more accurate, but due to the large
space of the detention chamber in the dilution cooling device, two
pumps and many pipelines are required, which will require attention
during field sampling work. In actual measurements, the use of the de-
vice is extremely limited [102].

4. Emission characteristics and co-removal of organic pollutants
from CFPPs

With increasing restrictions on the emissions of air pollutants from
coal combustion, the share of APCDs devices (SCR, ESP, WFGD, and
WESP) used to remove conventional pollutants (NOX, PM, and SO2) is
rising rapidly in CFPPs, especially in China. As of the end of 2016, the
installed SO2 control devices and SCR devices are fitted to nearly 93 % of
the total installed capacity of coal-fired generating units and nearly 86 %
of the total installed capacity of thermal power units, respectively.
Because, APCDs system have a synergistic removal effect for organic
pollutants, and many new APCDs include a combination of control units,
a significant reduction in the targeted emissions should have been
achieved. In this section, the field-test data for organic pollutants co-
removal efficiencies across APCDs and the concentration of organic
pollutants in the flue gas emissions released into the atmosphere were
both collected from papers published worldwide from 2000 to 2023 and
are reported in Tables S4–S6.

4.1. Emission characteristics of organic pollutants

4.1.1. VOCs

The complex chemical composition of coal leads to a complex variety
of organic pollutants in the flue gas produced during coal combustion
[103]. Higher furnace temperatures can accelerate the release of organic
materials present in coal. When the flue gas remains in the furnace for a
shorter duration, the incomplete oxidation process will worsen, leading
to the increased release of VOCs. The reduction of excess air coefficient
will promote the formation of halogenated hydrocarbons. Furthermore,
the volatilized oxy-aromatic carbon will also release phenolic com-
pounds during the oxidation process, especially low-rank coal. In addi-
tion, the variation of boiler operating conditions has an important effect
on pollution formation. This is reflected in Table S4 which summarizes
the VOC emission concentrations in the gas flow from CFPPs (stack
emissions) in different regions of the world. The results show that the
type and concentration of the individual VOCs emitted by CFPPs are
quite different, and the total VOC concentration in the gas emissions is
generally lower than 20 mg/m3. VOCs in the coal-fired flue gas are
usually divided into alkanes/alkenes, halogenated hydrocarbons,
oxygen-containing organic compounds (OVOCs) and aromatic hydro-
carbons, corresponding to typical substances found in the flue gas, such
as n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and benzene. Based on
on-site sampling tests 34 different kinds of VOCs were emitted from a
CFPP and a coal pilot plant, both connected to the same boiler [37], and
the individual VOC concentration varied between 0.1 and 53 μg/m3, as
shown in Fig. S6. Boiler load was a very important factor in determining
the amount and composition of VOC emissions, especially for chlori-
nated VOCs. As shown in Fig. S6, which illustrates that the concentration
of chlorinated VOCs in the flue gas at low-load operating conditions is
significantly higher than that at high-load operating conditions. This
happens when the boiler temperature drops because the flue gas rate is
low, providing a suitable kinetic condition that leads to chlorine gas
formation through the Decan reaction, and then the chlorine-free radi-
cals formed would react with other the organic compounds to form

halogenated hydrocarbons. The largest contribution VOC species was
aromatics with high-load operating conditions, followed by OVOCs,
halogenated hydrocarbons, and alkanes/alkenes. However, the data in
Table S4 would suggest that there is no obvious correlation between the
total concentration of VOCs emitted from CFPPs and the number of
VOCs detected by gas analysis or the size of coal-fired units [41].

According to current research results [32,37,104], the major reasons
for the huge difference in VOCs emission concentration in coal emissions
(smoke) are as follows.

(1) Combustion mode and combustion conditions. At present, the
arrangement of the burners of a coal-fired boiler can be of the
tangentially fired type or face-fired type. The pulverized coal flow
from the tangential combustor passes through the central region
of the combustor and produces a high temperature flue gas of
which some of the energy benefits the jet root of the adjacent
combustor, by helping its ignition performance and the degree of
coal burnout. The face-fired burner causes the coal powder to be
sprayed into the furnace chamber to form a symmetrical V-sha-
ped flame, and the coal powder before and after the flame con-
verges into a W-shaped flame, so that the front and rear flames
are mutually supported and conducive to firing. However, in
order to achieve the ideal combustion condition, it is necessary to
have a good symmetry between the air volume of the pipes on the
front and rear walls and the coal powder mixed in the flame.
Garcia et al. [32] tested the VOCs emission concentrations of four
CFPPs, finding that the emissions from a burner arranged for
frontal firing were much higher than for tangential firing. In
addition, they also carried out tests on the same 250 MW boiler
under different combustion load conditions, and found that the
increase of the load leads to a significant increase in the con-
centration of certain types of VOCs in the flue gas especially
toluene, which increased from 27 μg/m3 at 130 MW to 400 μg/m3
at 235 MW.

(2) Coal type. From the discussion on the occurrence of organic
matter in coal in Section 2.2 and the release of VOCs during coal
pyrolysis in Section 2.3, coal type is one of the important factors
affecting the release of organic pollutants during coal combus-
tion. Pudasainee et al. [104] reported on the concentration of
VOCs from burning different types of coals and showed that
compared with anthracite coal, the concentration of VOCs
released by bituminous coal combustion was lower. They sug-
gested that this might be due to an increased degree of incom-
plete combustion due to anthracite being more mature and
having a higher ignition point than bituminous coal.

(3) Arrangement of existing APCDs. The results in Table S4 show that
Pudasainee et al. [104] and Shi et al. [41] tested two CFPPs, each
emitting high VOC concentrations. One was equipped with only
an ESP + FGD system and had emissions around 3.33–9.04
mg/m3 VOCs, whereas the other CFPP had only an ESP dust
removal system and emitted 16.30 mg/m3 VOCs Since the two
CFPPs were not equipped with a denitrification SCR device they
did not benefit from the presence of a denitrification catalyst in
the SCR device, to reduce the amount of VOCs emissions by
oxidation.

(4) Sampling method. The sampling method is also one of the
important factors affecting the mass concentration of VOCs
emissions during coal combustion. Xu et al. [105] compared the
concentration of VOCs obtained by bag sampling and summa
canister sampling in a 220 MW coal-fired unit. The results
showed that the concentration obtained by bag sampling (13456
± 47 μg/m3) was significantly higher than that obtained by
summa canister sampling (4166 ± 1034 μg/m3). This was mainly
due to the high temperature and high humidity of the flue gas,
which greatly reduced the collection efficiency of summa can
sampling for benzene and ethylbenzene. Liu et al. [37] compared

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)10123113

J. Liu et al.

the concentrations of VOCs obtained by adsorption tube sampling
and direct docking sampling in a 300 MW coal-fired unit. The
results indicated that the concentration obtained by adsorption
tube sampling was slightly lower than that by online sampling,
accounting for 78.51–98.05 % of the total VOCs, mainly because
the adsorbent has a certain selectivity for organic matter. How-
ever, it is worth noting that regardless of the sampling method
used, the sampling results are basically within an order of
magnitude. The bag sampling method can capture the most
VOCs, but the bag needs to be stored at a high temperature
(120
C) after sampling, which increases the difficulty of field
testing. Therefore, the most commonly used method is the
adsorption tube sampling method, even though it makes the test
concentration slightly lower than the concentration of VOCs in
the actual flue gas.

◦

In summary, the type of coal, loading allowance, boiler operating
parameters, and equipment installed in a APCD are the major factors
that determine the emission level of VOCs. The coal type used will often
have been identified when the power plant was built. The loading
allowance depends on the energy grid demand, and there is little flexi-
bility to adjust it. There is a challenge to operating the boiler when the
50 % load capacity is applied. Thus, adopting advanced APCDs, those
equipped with SCR, ESP, WFGD, and WESP at the same time, may be one
option for controlling the emission of VOCs in a facility. Another is to
blend different coals.

4.1.2. PAHs

CFPPs, are an important source of PAHs emissions, and the PAHs will
be transported to the environment in the flue gas and fly ash emissions
[106]. Gune et al. [107] tested the concentration of PAHs in the sur-
rounding environment of CFPPs and found that the concentration of
PAHs in air and soil were 0.71–2.99 ng/m3 and 1.59–22.7 ng/g,
respectively. This indicates that the soil in proximity to CFPPs was
contaminated by the PAHs emissions from thermal power plants.
Therefore, it is particularly important to clearly understand the distri-
bution of the PAHs emitted from CFPPs.

Table S5 summarizes the PAHs emission concentrations from CFPPs
reported in the literature, indicating that the emitted PAHs can be
detected on bottom ash (slag), fly ash, CPM and in the flue gases. In
addition, PAHs in flue gas can be divided into particulate-phase (usually
attached to particles) and a gaseous-phase. PAHs emission concentration
from different CFPPs varies as is indicated by the concentration range of
PAHs: for instance, the PAH attached to fly ash, particulate-phase (free
of ash), and gaseous-phase was 0.20–34.7, 0.12–11.2 and 0.42–43.3 μg/
m3 respectively. This range of PAHs reflects the different boiler oper-
ating parameters in CFPPs, different combustion conditions, excess air
ratios used, different residence times, and properties of raw coal, as was
discussed in section 2.3. Therefore, more data is needed than what is
presently available in emission inventories (EI) before a quantitative
source analysis can be performed to accurately evaluate the contribution
of coal sources to total PAHs emissions. The following conclusions can
be drawn from the current research results [38,108].

(1) Compared with gaseous-phase PAHs,

the concentration of
particulate-phase PAHs in flue gas is lower. At present, CFPPs are
nearly all equipped with an ESP to greatly reduce the emission
concentration of PM in the flue gas, resulting in that the con-
centration of particulate-phase PAHs in the flue gas is signifi-
cantly lower than the concentration of gaseous-phase PAHs,
which is generally less than 10 μg/m3. According to the distri-
bution characteristics of PAHs in samples, it was found that light-
molecular weight (LMW) PAHs mainly occur in the gaseous
-phase, while high-molecular weight (HMW) PAHs are mainly
associated with the particulate-phase [38,109]. This is mainly
due to the high vapor pressure of LMW-PAHs, which makes them

more easily volatilized and/or desorbed into the gas phase from
the particulate matter [108,110].

(2) The PAHs emission concentration in a circulating fluidized bed
(CFB) boiler is higher than that in a pulverized coal (PC) boiler.
Wang et al. [29] and Lu et al. [111] monitored PAHs concen-
tration in coal flue gases from CFBs of different capacities. Their
results showed that gas phase PAHs concentration ranged be-
tween 28.3 and 43.3 μg/m3, which was in general higher than
that for PC boilers (0.42–15.1 μg/m3). The fact that the concen-
tration of PAHs reaches the peak value at 800
C, as compared
C) – (see
with the peak temperature of the PC boiler (1200
◦
Section 2.3), explains why the CFB boiler temperature (850
C) is
more conducive to the generation of PAHs during combustion.

◦

◦

(3) The concentration of PAHs in bottom ash and fly ash reported in
the literature varies with combustion conditions and type of solid
fuel used. Ruwei et al. [112] compared the concentration of PAHs
in fly ash and bottom ash of a 0.600 WM CFPP and found that the
fly ash and bottom ash PAH content varied as 0.93–2.08 and
2.83–5.32 μg/m3, respectively. However, when they could not
explain the higher concentration of PAH content in bottom ash
relative to the PAH content in fly ash, they compared the TOC
content in both fly ash and bottom ash samples. The result was a
correlation, in each case between TOC and PAH content, rather
than particle size. Karapanagioti et al. [113] showed that organic
carbon can adsorb organic compounds in the gaseous environ-
ment better than the mineral matter in coal. Therefore, when the
carbon content in the bottom ash in a CFPP is higher than that in
fly ash, the concentration of PAHs in the bottom ash would be
higher than that in fly ash.

(4) The PAHs in raw coal and bottom ash are mainly composed of 5-
ring and 6-ring compounds, while in fly ash the PAHs are mainly
composed of medium molecular weight and LMW-PAHs (2- or 3-
ring). Although the concentration of PAHs contained in fly ash
varied from 0.196 μg/g to 37.6 μg/g, there was a great uniformity
in the number and distribution of PAHs rings such that 2, 3 or 4-
ring PAHs were the main species in fly ash samples. Li et al. [114]
analyzed five kinds of fly ash samples with different particle size
distributions produced from a CFPP and found that 3- and 4-ring
PAHs in fly ash accounted for more than 80 % of the total PAHs.
Similar results have also been reported in other literature
[115–117]. In addition, for the bottom ash, the proportion of
HMW-PAHs was higher than that of the fly ash. This is mainly
because LMW-PAHs tend to decompose into small organic com-
pounds or to form carbon dioxide and water during the
high-temperatures available during the combustion phase, while
HMW-PAHs have a greater chance of remaining in the bottom ash
during the incomplete combustion phase in the furnace.

(5) The concentration of PAHs in fly ash is inversely proportional to
the particle size [118–120]. Because of the ESP with different
electric fields, fly ash could be captured in order of particle size
from largest to smallest. Wang et al. [121] analyzed the PAHs
concentration associated with PM1, PM1-2.5 and PM2.5-10 in the
flue gas, and found that the amount followed the order PM1>
PM1-2.5 > PM2.5-10. Fine particle fly ash usually has a larger sur-
face area per unit mass than coarse particle fly ash, which can
provide more surface area on which the PAHs can condense.
Therefore, more PAHs can condense and be absorbed on the
particles than on the coarse particles. Arditsoglou et al. [116] also
showed that the concentration of all PAHs, especially those with
high molecular weight, was negatively correlated with particle
size. Fine particulate organic compounds can grow to larger
particles via the volatilization/adsorption process [122–124],
while HMW-PAHs in fine particles are generally less likely to
transfer to larger particles. In contrast, the concentration of
LMW-PAHs is more likely to be split evenly between fine and
large particles. Therefore, more attention should be paid to PAHs

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)10123114

J. Liu et al.

in the PM1 size range, because these small particles can enter
human lungs directly from the respiratory system and harm
human health.

According to present statistics, the CFPPs fly ash production world-
wide can reach 1 billion tons. However, the current rate at which fly ash
is being used for commercial and other purposes is still very low, and
most of it ends up in landfills. Although PAHs content in fly ash is not
high, a large amount of coal consumption worldwide will result in the
accumulation of PAHs in the environment. Therefore, this source of
environmental pollution can be reduced significantly by recycling the fly
ash collected or degrading PAHs associated with the fly and by effec-
tively controlling CFB boiler gas phase PAHs emissions at the facility
level.

In addition to the 16 priority PAHs announced by the US EPA
(pPAHs), emissions of substituted PAHs (oPAHs, nPAHs) cannot be
ignored due to their stronger mutagenicity and carcinogenicity potential
than PAHs [125,126]. At present, research on substituted PAHs emis-
sions in coal-fired flue gas is gradually being carried out. Wang et al.
[121] investigated the total concentrations of nPAHs (7 types) in
PM2.5-10, PM1-2.5 and PM1 emitted from the flue gas of three coal-fired
units each equipped with only an ESP, which were 50.8–84.4,
74.3–133.2, 109.6–186.8 ng/m3, respectively, and the corresponding
total concentrations of 16 PAHs for the three particle sizes were
5.28–7.45, 8.02–11.27, 13.08–16.32 μg/m3, respectively. In addition,
they also investigated the total concentrations of nPAHs in PM2.5-10,
PM1-2.5 and PM1 in the flue gas of three coal-fired units equipped with
ESP + WFGD, which were 18.8–31.9, 29.3–74.3, and 46.9–72.9 ng/m3,
respectively, and the total concentrations of 16 PAHs were 2.86–4.52,
3.82–8.02, and 6.10–10.56 μg/m3, respectively. The results indicated
that the emission characteristics of nPAHs in CFPPs are basically
consistent with those of pPAHs, but the emission concentration is usu-
ally one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of pPAHs. More-
over, WFGD plays an important role in reducing the emission
concentration of PAHs. To further observe the effects of PAHs from
CFPPs on the surrounding environment, Lafontaine et al. [127]
compared the concentrations of pPAHs, nPAHs, and oPAHs in ambient
high-volume PM2.5 air samples taken during operation and shutdown of
a 585 MW CFPP in Boardman OR. According to the findings, the
contribution of the plant to pPAHs, nPAHs, and oPAHs reached 67 %, 91
% and 54 %, respectively. Despite the low emission concentration of
substituted PAHs in coal-fired flue gas, it is evident that the environ-
mental impact of these emissions cannot be disregarded and warrants
more investigation.

4.1.3. CPM

Currently, FPM is the main target of ESP or FF devices installed in
CFPPs, while CPM emissions were ignored. A number of researchers
have sought to rectify this omission by measuring CPM emissions. A
review of the literature indicates that the CPM emission concentration
from CFPPs varies from 5.90 to 65.1 mg/m3, which accounts for
65.3–93.1 % of the total PM2.5, as shown in Table S6. Analysis of the
condensable particles showed that the CPM was mainly composed of
organic and inorganic components. The proportion of organic compo-
nents varied between 10.4 and 90.0 % and was mainly composed of
alkanes and esters. In addition, organic acids, phenols, ketones and ar-
omatic compounds were also detected. For example, Wu et al. [128]
investigated the CPM emission characteristics in the flue gas of four
typical CFPPs and their results showed that the organic component
averaged around 55.5 %, as shown in Fig. S7. In addition, water-soluble
and Ca2+
2(cid:0)
ions such as SO4
were the main inorganic compo-
, Cl
2(cid:0)
nents in the CPM samples, where SO4
was present in large concentra-
tions [129–132].

, Na

+

(cid:0)

Feng et al. [133] investigated by electron microscopy a number of
CPM samples as a first step in exploring the mechanism by which they
were formed. The particles in their CPM samples shown in Fig. S8 (a) are

in the shape of droplets rather than in the spherical shape of fly ash. In
addition, the particles in Fig. S8 (b) are surrounded by the filter mem-
brane fibers, indicating that the particles are produced by in-situ
the “evapo-
condensation. The above phenomenon indicates that
ration-condensation” mechanism is one of the mechanisms by which
CPM are formed [134,135]. The pictures in Fig. S8 (c) and (d) indicate
that the morphology of condensed CPM is diverse. The broken particles
in Fig. S8 (d) may have been caused by the nitrogen flow used to dry the
solution in the impinger. The CPM emission concentration is mainly
affected by flue gas temperature and combustion conditions, which are
discussed as follows.

1. Flue gas temperature. The concentration of CPM in the flue gas in-
creases with a decrease in the flue gas temperature [132,136]. A low
flue gas temperature allows more substances to reach the phase
transition point, so that more CPM gaseous precursors are condensed
and converted into FPM before exiting the chimney in a CFPP,
thereby reducing the emission concentration of CPM into the atmo-
sphere. Since, the inorganic components in CPM are more sensitive
than the organic components to a reduction in flue gas temperature,
they will be found in greater proportion relative to the inorganic
components at lower temperatures.

(cid:0)

and Cl

2. Combustion conditions. A field test by Qi et al. [137] showed that the
CPM emission concentration increased when the unit load was
decreased. During the actual emission process, the concentration of
CPM is mainly affected by the precursor concentrations of organic
and inorganic components. The CPM organic component produced is
complex and contains hundreds of organic compounds. Among them,
lipids and alkanes are the main components of organic components.
However, the CPM inorganic component, consists mainly of anions
2(cid:0)
. The for-
and cations such as, Na
such as SO4
mation of these ions is mainly attributed to the composition of the
coal and WFGD device, indicating that the content of S and Cl in coal
and WFGD operating conditions will influence the CPM release
characteristics during the combustion process. Regarding the char-
acteristics and control of CPM emissions during the combustion
process, further research is needed, which would involve performing
experiments combined with the use of mathematical models. Excess
air coefficient (EAC), EAC also plays important roles in influencing
the amount of CPM emissions. However, a higher EAC brings in more
oxygen during the combustion process, resulting in more complete
combustion, which reduces the concentration of organic precursors
and thus reduces the CPM emission concentration.

+

3. Sampling temperature. Although, this is not an operational param-
eter, it has can influence the concentration of CPM collected. Peng
et al. [132] indicated that a high EAC and a low sampling temper-
ature in the flue gas caused an increase in the concentration of the
organic components in CPM collected on a sample, as shown in
Fig. S9 However, a high flue gas temperature in the sampling line (i.
e., of the airflow flowing through the pipeline of the sampling sys-
tem) will prevent the precursor materials of CPM from condensing
before entering the sampler.

4. Sampling method. Variations in sampling techniques can lead to
discrepancies in the measured CPM concentrations. Wang et al.
[138] evaluated three different methods—dry impinger, indirect
dilution, and direct dilution—for measuring CPM emissions from
typical stationary sources in China (CFPPs, steel mills, and waste
incineration plants). Their results indicated that the total mass con-
centrations of CPM measured by dry impaction were consistently
higher than those measured by the two dilution methods. Compared
to the direct dilution method, the indirect dilution method more
effectively captures the rapid dilution, cooling, and condensation
processes of condensable gas precursors in the presence of filterable
particulates. Both impinger cooling and dilution cooling methods
have their respective advantages and limitations, and each requires
further refinement and improvement for practical applications. For

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)10123115

J. Liu et al.

the impinger cooling methods, the primary advantage is the ability to
measure separately both FPM and CPM during a sampling run.
However, impinger cooling methods need to minimize the influence
of water-soluble gases like SO2, enhance the flue gas heat exchange
area and residence time to ensure complete condensation of gaseous
CPM, and improve the capture efficiency of ultra-fine CPM by the
post-CPM filter membrane. For the dilution cooling methods, the
formation process of CPM upon entering the air atmosphere from a
stack is accurately reflected. Areas for enhancement
include
increasing the portability of the sampling apparatus, achieving sep-
aration of FPM and CPM during dilution condensation sampling run,
and ensuring thorough cleaning and recovery of particles adhered to
the chamber walls.

Even though APCDs have been in use for some time, their capture
efficiency for CPM is still not ideal. They are more effective at removing
inorganic compounds than organic compounds, which is a problem
when the purpose is to control CPM emissions.

Based on VOCs, PAHs, and CPM emission data in Tables S4–S6,
global annual emissions of organic pollutants from CFPPs are estimated.
Emission factors (EFs) for VOCs, PAHs, and CPM are obtained by Eq. (1)
[139], expressed as grams of pollutant per kilogram of coal, based on the
mass concentration of the target pollutant and the flue gas flow rate.

EF (g / kg) = C × F

/ (cid:0)

)

M × 103

(1)

where, C is the mass concentration of total VOCs or PAHs or CPM (mg/
m3), F is the flow rate of flue gas in the chimney/stack (m3/h), M is the
weight of the coal per hour (kg/h).

The average concentrations of VOCs, PAHs in flue gas, and CPM from
CFPPs were 1.51 mg/m3, 0.038 mg/m3, and 10.3 mg/m3, respectively,
and the corresponding emission factors are 0.015 g/kg, 0.0038 g/kg and
0.103 g/kg. The detailed calculation process is summarized in the
Supporting Materials (Appendix IV). Based on the global consumption of
coal used in CFPPs, the total VOCs, PAH, and the organic constituents of
CPM emissions in flue gas from CFPPs are estimated to be 88.1 Gg, 2.22
Gg, and 328 GJ, respectively. In addition, based on the average con-
centration of PAHs in fly ash (5.55 μg/g), it was determined that about
4.54 Gg of PAHs were attached to fly ash and discharged into the
environment.

In addition to coal-fired power generation,

the metallurgy,
manufacturing of building materials, chemical industry and residential
coal combustion are also significant consumers of coal. Among these,
combustion sources that rely solely on coal as a fuel are predominantly
found in residential coal combustion and coal-fired industrial boilers.
Table S8 summarizes the EFs of VOCs, PAHs, and CPM from residential
coal combustion and coal-fired industrial boilers. The average EFs of
VOCs, PAHs, and CPM from residential coal combustion are 0.333 g/kg,
0.0654 g/kg, and 0.418 g/kg, respectively, which are 22.2, 17.2, and
4.06 times higher than those from CFPPs. This is mainly because resi-
dents mainly use traditional stoves that lack pollution control equipment
to burn coal, resulting in a large amount of direct emissions of organic
pollutants. Combined with the global consumption of scattered coal
combustion [140], the total VOCs, PAHs and CPM emissions are esti-
mated to be 149.9 Gg, 29.4 Gg, and 188.1 Gg.

For industrial coal-fired boilers, the average EFs of VOCs, PAHs and
CPM are 0.025 g/kg, 0.0081 g/kg and 0.394 g/kg, respectively, which
are slightly higher than those of CFPPs. The coal consumption of coal-
fired industrial boilers is estimated based on global industrial coal
consumption and steel and cement production, corresponding to total
VOCs, PAHs and CPM emissions are estimated at 10.87 Gg, 2.75 Gg, and
74.6 Gg.

It is evident that the APCD system in CFPPs demonstrates excellent
performance in the collaborative removal of VOCs and PAHs, and is no
longer a primary coal-fired fixed source of VOCs and PAHs emissions.
However, the collaborative removal efficiency of CPM is unsatisfactory,

making it the largest coal-fired fixed source of CPM emissions at present.
Overall, the emission levels of organic pollutants in CPM are significant
and cannot be disregarded.

4.2. Co-removal efficiencies across air pollution control devices

The increase in awareness of the need for environmental protection
and the increase in the stringency of the emission standards for con-
trolling pollutants from CFPPs led to the development of new emission
control technologies, which were often adopted by CFPPs in their APCDs
to meet their specific emission limits. Take China as an example, the
implementation of the ultra-low emission standards (NOX < 50 mg/m3,
SO2 < 35 mg/m3, PM < 5 mg/m3) has resulted in an increase in the
installed capacity of FGDs from more than 50 % at the end of 2007 to 93
% at the end of 2016 [141]. The current research results have confirmed
that the APCDs installed in CFPPs not only have the effect of removing
conventional pollutants such as NOX, SO2, PM, and mercury, but also
have a significant synergistic effect on the removal of organic pollutants.
In the following section the role played by each unit of an APCD for
removing organic pollutants is presented.

4.2.1. Selective catalytic reduction

◦

The SCR device in a CFPP mainly uses the V2O5-WO3/TiO2 type
catalyst to remove NOX in the flue gas. The high flue gas temperature
(260–380
C) in an SCR device provides good reaction conditions for this
catalyst. In a recent study [37], the use of this catalyst resulted in a
decrease in the concentration of 34 VOCs entering the SCR device, under
two load conditions (100 % and 50 % load)– from 440.8 to 284.1 μg/m3
to 108.3 and 66.7 μg/m3, respectively, as shown in Fig. S10. This in-
dicates that the catalyst used in the SCR device can have a synergistic
oxidation effect on VOCs in addition to its role in reducing NOx. This is
also supported by an earlier study by Delaigle et al. [142] who found
that the VOX/TiO2 catalytic system was effective at removing aromatic
VOCs under laboratory-scale conditions.

Three mechanisms are at present being used to describe the oxida-
tion of VOCs by a catalyst. They include the Mars-van Krevelen (M-vK)
mechanism [143], Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism [144] and
Eley–Rideal (E-R) mechanism [145]. The M-vK mechanism, also known
as the redox mechanism, consists of a redox cycle as demonstrated in
Fig. S10 (a). First, VOC molecules interact with the lattice oxygen on the
catalyst surface, and the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface are
formed. Then, these reduced centers are regenerated by gaseous oxygen
or oxygen atoms from the bulk gas phase. The L-H mechanism is shown
in Fig. S10 (b). The first step of L-H mechanism is the adsorption of
oxygen and VOCs on the catalyst, which is followed by a redox process.
According to whether VOCs and oxygen adsorb on the same active sites
on the catalyst, L-H model can be divided into single site L-H model and
dual site L-H model. Fig. S10 (c) shows a depiction of the E-R mecha-
nism, which is similar to L-H mechanism, except for the method by
which oxygen molecules and the pollutants interact. That is, oxygen
atoms are first adsorbed on the catalyst’s surface and the VOCs are
oxidized in the gas phase.

Under the actual operating conditions of a CFPP, the performance of
the SCR catalyst in a APCD can be affected by the boiler load since it can
affect on the flue gas temperature entering the SCR device. When the
boiler load is increased, the concentration of VOCs in the flue gas at the
inlet of the SCR device may significantly increase. At the same time, a
higher temperature flue gas can enhance the oxidation of the VOCs by
the SCR catalyst. This is supported by the results in a previous study
where the NMHCs removal efficiency of the SCR device increased from
30 % at 339
C [12]. However, at lower loads, if the
temperature of the flue gas entering the SCR device is below that
required for the catalyst to function properly, the VOC oxidation effi-
ciency of the catalyst will be reduced.

C to 70 % at 374

◦

Although the removal efficiency for total VOCs by SCR devices is
reported to be high, the SCR devices seem to be less efficient at removing

PAHs, and there is evidence that the concentration of specific PAHs at
the exit of a SCR device is increased. Field tests on PAHs concentration in
the flue gas at the inlet and outlet of a SCR device showed that the 2, 4, 5,
and 6-ring PAHs were significantly increased except for 3-ring PAHs
concentration which were reduced in concentration [146]. Hsu et al.
[147] recorded the distribution of PAHs concentration leaving the SCR
device and indicated that the concentrations of 3- and 4-ring PAHs
(AcPy, Acp, Ant, FL, Pyr, BaA, CHR) at the outlet of the SCR device
increased significantly. Currently, the growth mechanisms of PAHs are
divided into: HACA [148,149], hydrogen extraction and hydrogen
abstraction acetylene addition (HAVA) [150], methyl addition/cycli-
zation (MAC) [151], and phenyl addition/cyclization (PAC) [152]. The
reaction paths are shown in Fig. 10. Acetylene, is a small molecule

released in the process of coal burning, may contribute to speeding up of
the molecular growth of PAHs in the presence of a SCR catalyst. This
might explain why PAHs in flue gas cannot be effectively removed by a
SCR device. Also, the high temperature and particles in the gas envi-
ronment during the denitrification process are conducive to the cycling
and polymerization of PAHs from low ring to high ring, thus producing
new compounds, some of which can lead to an increase in the toxicity of
flue gas.

For CPM, a SCR device showed a certain positive effect on the
removal of organic components, mainly due to the catalytic oxidation of
organic precursors by the SCR catalysts. The results of Xu et al. [153]
show that the concentration of organic components of CPM in flue gas
exposed to the SCR catalyst decreased from 21.5 to 19.8 mg/m3, which

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience109(2025)10123117

J. Liu et al.

corresponds to an 8 % removal efficiency. However, the inorganic
component concentration associated with CPM increased significantly.
To achieve efficient removal of NO in flue gas, excessive NH3 would
need to be injected before the SCR device, which will directly lead to an
+
increase of NH4
concentration. At the same time, part of SO2 will be
oxidized to SO3 by the SCR catalyst, which increases the concentration
2(cid:0)
of SO4
ions in the flue gas. This was confirmed by the results of Ruan
et al. [154], who found that the concentrations of Na
and
2(cid:0)
in PM1 increased significantly after the SCR device, resulting in a
SO4
+
52.11 % increase in the concentration of PM1. NH4
ions, as the
main matter of the inorganic components of CPM, will directly affect the
total concentration of CPM. Field test results by Xu et al. [153] showed
that the concentration of inorganic components of CPM increased from
15.02 to 23.41 mg/m3. In conclusion, SCR devices do not play a positive
role in the synergistic removal of CPM.

4.2.2. ESP

◦

◦

C to about 150

During coal combustion, a large number of particles are present in
the flue gas. When the flue gas flows from a SCR to an ESP, the flue gas
temperature can drop from 300
C after passing through
the preheater. The sudden temperature drops cause part of the organic
pollutants (VOCs and PAHs) in the flue gas to condense and deposit on
the surface of fly ash particles which are removed by the electric charges
generated in the ESP. Since PAHs have a much higher boiling point than
the VOCs, more PAHs will condense and deposit on the ash, resulting in
a higher removal efficiency of PAHs in the flue gas exiting the ESP. This
has also been proven through field tests [29,38]. Results from the four
units tested indicated that the removal efficiency of VOCs by the ESP
device was below 30 % [12,37]. In addition, the electrostatic effect of an
ESP on small objects causes the fine particles in the gas stream to be
separated from the surface of the larger particles. This effect was
observed by using a ELPI
device, which can evaluate the surface
charges of particles with different particle sizes at the ESP outlet [155].
During this process, electrostatic repulsion causes some VOCs (such as
1-dodecene, Tetrachloroethylene, and styrene) absorbed by fly ash are
released into the flue gas again, resulting in a higher concentration of
VOCs in the flue gas at the ESP outlet than at the inlet.

+

Yin et al. [156] conducted tests on 300 MW and 600 MW CFPPs and
found that the removal efficiency for PAHs by the installed ESP could
reach 43.4 % and 64.3 % respectively. However, Guerriero et al. [157]
indicated that the removal efficiency for PAHs of an ESP unit installed in
medical waste incinerators was generally less than 15 %. This is an
indication that performance of an ESP is dependent on the flue gas
environment.

In recent years, in order to achieve ultra-low emissions, research
work in China has led to the development of a Low Temperature – ESP
(LLT-ESP), which is a popular and efficient control device for PAHs. An
LLT-ESP system reduces the temperature of the flue gas (at the inlet of
the LLE-ESP device) below the acid dew point using a flue gas cooler
positioned before the ESP. This had the effect of reducing the specific
resistance of fly ash and the flow velocity of flue gas, which can further
improve the capture efficiency of particulate matters by the ESP, espe-
cially those with small particle sizes. The lower flue gas temperature and
higher fly ash capture efficiency can further improve the capture of
VOCs and PAHs. Li et al. [38] showed that LLT-ESP has a good removal
effect on total PAH emissions, in which the removal rate of gas phase
PAHs is about 88 % and particulate phase PAHs of 98 %. Similar results
were also shown in the study by Li et al. [158]. Therefore, compared
with conventional ESP systems, the LLT-ESP system is more efficient in
removing PAHs. The lower inlet temperature for LLT-ESP not only en-
hances the condensation effect of PAHs, but also enhances the adsorp-
tion capacity of PAHs for particulate matter in the flue gas.

In addition to the evaluation of the total removal efficiency of an
ESP, more attention has been paid to the capture characteristics of PAHs
by changing the electric field applied in an ESP. Liu et al. [159] collected
the fly ash from a 5-level electric field ESP ash hopper (F1 through F5)

and then characterized the resulting PAHs distribution. They found that
most of the PAHs, especially the 5 and 6 ring PAHs, were removed by the
fourth (F4) and fifth (F5) electric field. On the other hand, Li et al. [38]
showed that the first (F1) electric field played a more critical role than
the second (F2), and the third (F3) electric field. Almost all the 5- and
6-ring PAHs in the flue gas were removed in the first electric field. The
fact that the PAHs capture characteristics did not follow the same
electric field/ash-hopper order in these two studies can be attributed to
the use of different ESP designs. The former is a conventional ESP and
the latter is an LLT-ESP system. The lower temperature of the flue gas at
the inlet of LLT-ESP allowed the high molecular weight PAHs in the gas
phase to condense and deposit on the fly ash particles before entering
the ESP, to be captured when they enter the first electric field (F1).
However, a large number of the PAHs would, at this point, still be in the
gaseous and particulate phases when they enter a conventional ESP. As
it is very difficult to charge 0.1–0.3 μm particles in an electric field,
many fine particles are transformed into larger particles through
Brownian motion, collision, and agglomeration as they flow from one
electric field to another and thus are exposed to the different charge
capacities, resulting in high ring PAHs being captured by fourth and fifth
electric field.

The ESP device also plays a positive role in removing CPM. The
removal mechanism of organic pollutants in CPM by an ESP is primarily
attributed to two factors. First, the inherent properties of an ESP enable
it to remove 99 % of FPM [160]. FPM surfaces adsorb many gaseous
CPM precursors, particularly organic pollutants. The high-voltage elec-
trostatic action of an ESP decomposes large organic molecules into
smaller fragments [161]. On the other hand, the significant temperature
drop (~150
C) of flue gas within the ESP further promotes CPM
condensation, markedly reducing the concentration of organic pollut-
ants in CPM [162]. Wu et al. [163] investigated the impact of APCDs on
CPM emission concentrations from coal-fired circulating fluidized bed
boilers. Their results showed that organic components constituted the
majority of CPM (73.87–96.30 %), with ESP achieving a removal effi-
ciency of 63.86 % for these organic constituents.

4.2.3. WFGD

The WFGD system in a CFPP is installed to remove SO2 in the flue gas
using limestone-gypsum. In a scrubbing tower of a WFGD, the recircu-
lating slurry spraying effect will not only reduce the flue gas tempera-
ture but also capture fine particles. The decrease in temperature
promotes uniform nucleation in the gas phase and non-uniform
condensation process of the precursors of CPM on fly ash and droplets
[164,165]. From the data collated in Table S7, it can be seen that the
removal efficiencies for pollutants such as VOCs, PAHs and CPM in the
flue gas under the effect of water washing, condensation, and gypsum
adsorption are lower than 16.1 %, 16.0–41.4 %, and 9.4–63 %,
respectively. However, field tests showed that the concentration of VOCs
and inorganic components in CPM increased in the WFGD outlet flue gas
stream [37,42]. The increase in VOCs could have been caused by the
release of some of the VOCs adsorbed on small particles during the
spraying process. In addition, the slurry scouring and flue gas carrying
2(cid:0)
effect of WFGD system significantly increased the concentration of SO4
in the export flue gas, leading to the increase of the concentration of
inorganic components [154,166,167]. Huang et al. [168] also showed
that a large amount of H2SO4 aerosol was produced in a WFGD. In
addition, the cooling process of WFGD allows CPM precursors to
condense and convert to FPM. The effectiveness of WFGD in removing
inorganic pollutants from CPM is primarily attributed to the significant
temperature reduction and the physical and chemical scrubbing by the
desulphurization slurry. The removal of organic components in CPM is
mainly because some organic components are condensed and dis-
charged during the spray cooling process. Li et al. [169] also pointed out
that low-volatile organic matter is also easily removed by WFGD. In
addition, the dissolution of spray water also plays a great role in
removing CPM. Some esters will be dissolved by water and discharged

with desulphurization wastewater. Liu et al. [170] conducted a quan-
titative analysis of two typical lipids in CPM, showing that the removal
rate of phthalates in CPM by WFGD could reach 38.86 %. However,
some CPM may also be introduced into the flue gas due to contamination
of the circulating water and organic buffers used in the desulphurized
slurry. Song et al. [39] discovered that while WFGD helps reduce the
concentration of phthalates in CPM, it also promotes the formation of
n-alkanes. Overall, WFGD has a positive effect on the removal of organic
and inorganic components in CPM. However, for many insoluble CPM
organic components, it is not so effective and needs attention.

4.2.4. WESP

The WESP device is an ultra-low emission technology which can
capture submicron particles efficiently, including SO3 acid fog, fine dust,
and aerosols in the wet flue gas in order to achieve ultra-low emissions
levels [171,172]. Liu et al. [173] investigated the performance results
for 122 WESPs from CFPPs and found that the average removal effi-
ciencies for particulate matter, droplets (sulfuric acid, sulfate, SO2, and

condensed water) and SO3 were 81.4 %, 75.2 %, and 73.3 %, respec-
tively, with corresponding outlet concentrations of 3.82 mg/m3, 10.83
mg/m3, and 4.52 mg/m3. Based on the data in Table S7, the synergistic
effect of WESP on organic pollutants in the flue gas is as follows: PAHs >
CPM > VOCs. Almost all the particulate phase PAHs that were not
captured by the traditional ESP device were captured by WESP [109].
Only part of the gas phase PAHs escaped. The high humidity of the flue
gas makes the particles easy to charge and reduces their resistivity,
resulting in 13.1–29.7 % of the total CPM was captured [110]. The
impact of WESP on CPM is determined by the relative concentration of
gaseous CPM within the WESP [174]. This variability accounts for the
inconsistent results observed in existing studies regarding the effec-
tiveness of WESP on flue gas treatment. Liu et al. [173] conducted
empirical analysis on the CPM generated before and after the WESP in
300 MW and 30 MW coal-fired units, finding a significant increase in
CPM at low loads. Wu et al. [175] investigated the changes in PAH
emission concentrations from coal combustion across units ranging from
350 MW to 600 MW. The study revealed that at lower temperatures, the

J. Liu et al.

conversion of gaseous PAHs to CPM accelerates, and the emission con-
centration of CPM significantly decreases with increasing load.

However, the oxidation of the VOCs in a WESP device occurs by O,
OH, O3, and other free radicals generated during the WESP discharge
[176,177] and the removal efficiency of VOCs in a WESP device was
only 8.7 % [178]. Therefore, the assembly of the WESP devices could
further reduce the concentration of organic pollutants in a coal flue gas,
and reduce especially the emission concentration of PAHs, as indicated
above.

Based on the material presented so far, the APCD system of a CFPP
has a positive effect on the removal of organic pollutants in the flue gas.
The SCR device was the major contributor to VOC removal relying on
the catalyst’s oxidation effect. The ESP (LLT-ESP) and WESP devices
have a good removal performance for PAHs and CPM while efficiently
capturing particulate matter in a flue gas. In addition, spray washing in a
WFGD and the adsorption effect of gypsum both play a role in capturing
organic pollutants. Fig. 11 shows the range of removal efficiencies for
each control unit along an APCD system by pollutant, based on the data
in Table S7. The removal efficiencies for the VOCs, PAHs, and CPM
varied between 55.8 and 87.6 %, 74.7–89.8 %, and 36.3–86.6 %,
respectively.

5. The control technology for organic compounds from coal-
fired stationary sources

Organic pollutants in CFPPs can be controlled in both the pre-
combustion stage and post-combustion stage. During the combustion
stage, a controlled atmosphere is used and the coal is conditioned for the
specific combustion method used. The post-combustion removal stage
would involve making decisions about the technology that needs to be
used and decisions about the necessary upgrades and modifications to
the existing APCDs. This can involve the use of new and efficient cata-
lysts for organic pollutants in the denitration zone and the injection of
efficient adsorbents. The types of technologies used to remove organic
pollutants generated by CFPPs in the pre-combustion and post-
combustion stages are shown in Fig. 12.

5.1. Conditioning stages as a means of reducing the generation of organic
pollutants from coal combustion

As indicated in Section 2.3, incomplete combustion is one of the
important causes of organic pollutants in flue gas. Therefore, by opti-
mizing the combustion process one can reduce the amount of organic
pollutants generated. This can be achieved by adjusting fuel composi-
tion, combustion temperature [179], residence time [180], primary/-
secondary air ratio [181], and excess air ratio [182]. However, the
combustion parameters for CFPPs are determined according to the boiler
capacity and furnace size. These design considerations would need to be
taken into account when fuel conditioning and other methods of con-
ditioning are selected to control the formation of organic pollutants
during coal combustion.

Guo and Zhong [183] conducted a study on the co-combustion of
coal and composite biomass pellets (CBPs) in both a TG analyzer and a
fluidized bed reactor. Their results showed that using a mixing ratio of
30 % CBPs and 70 % coal or coke was considered to be the optimum
mixing ratio, producing both lower concentration of PAHs and trace
metal emissions, as shown in Fig. S11. The lower concentration of PAHs
is produced mainly because the composite biomass particles contain a
higher proportion of volatile substances, which are released earlier than
from bituminous coal and thus burn faster, resulting in more complete
combustion. In addition, CBP has a rougher surface and richer pore
structure than in coal particles, which allows oxygen to enter the par-
ticles easily and promotes more complete combustion, inhibiting PAHs
formation. Yelverton et al. [184] evaluated the organic pollutant
discharge of bituminous coal mixed with four kinds of biomass in a
pilot-scale coal-fired facility – in Triangle Park, North Carolina, found

that only the propane concentration of the hydrocarbons released by the
fuel mixture exceeded the minimum detection limits, and the removal
efficiency for propane exceeded 50 %. At the same time, both gaseous
and particulate emissions were reduced with the addition of woody
biomass materials. Similarly, Tan et al. [185] studied the effect of
co-combustion of wood particles and bituminous coal on the VOCs
emissions in a 0.8 MW pilot-scale Circulating Fluidized Combustor. The
emission concentrations of the 45 VOCs monitored at the exit of the
co-combustion decreased significantly (to less than 45.6 μg/m3). Spe-
cifically, the concentrations of chloromethane, carbon disulfide and
m/p-xylene decreased from 22.0, 4.75, and 1.94 μg/m3 to 5.84, 3.48,
and 0.69 μg/m3, respectively, corresponding removal efficiencies of
73.5 %, 26.7 %, and 64.4 %.

In addition to the above methods, metal oxides have often been used
to control the formation of organic pollutants from coal burning
resulting in them being the subject of many studies. At high tempera-
tures, metal oxides have certain adsorption and catalytic cracking effects
on organic pollutants, which might explain their effectiveness.
Currently, catalysts are also added to coal fed to a combustor. They are
mainly alkali metals and alkaline earth metals (AAEM) and some tran-
sition metal compounds. Calcium-based oxides in AAEM have been
proven to effectively control the formation of PAHs during the com-
bustion process [186]. They can react with hydroxyl radicals generating
alkali metal hydroxide ions at high temperatures, which will oxidize and
decompose PAHs. In addition, iron-based compounds in transition
metals are also widely used during coal combustion due to their ability
to reduce heavy hydrocarbon in the gaseous environment via a thermal
catalytic cracking mechanism. Yao et al. [187] found that adding 2 %
(by mass) Fe3O4 to raw coal reduced the PAH emission concentration by
35.7 % at 950
C. Qin et al. [188] studied the effect of adding 0.5 % (by
mass) iron scrap iron slag to a laboratory-scale dropper furnace, which
was operated at different temperatures, on the coal combustion effi-
ciency and the ability of the scrap iron slag to reduce the amount of
PAHs generated. Their results showed that the combustion efficiency of
coal increased with temperature: 3.10 % (950
C),
6.15 % (1150
C) so that the maximum efficiency
was reached at a temperature between 1150
C. Besides,
the removal rate for the sum of the EPA-16 PAHs also varied with

temperature: 24.81 % (950
and 44.43 % (1250
C), indicating that the effect of temperature on
combustion efficiency and PAH was not linear in that temperature
range. By analyzing the distribution characteristics of PAHs, they also
found that high-ring PAHs are more likely to be catalyzed and decom-
posed at the higher temperatures (>1150
C) investigated. A possible
reduction pathway for PAHs by a metal oxide was proposed [189] based
on the following reactions (2)–(5).

Therefore, whether this is the only pathway or not, metal oxides have
proven to be effective and it is possible to reduce the generation of
organic pollutants at the source using relatively inexpensive additives
and by optimizing the operating conditions. In addition, related studies
have also confirmed that metal oxides as additives can also help reduce
emissions of pollutants such as PM [190], NOx [191] and mercury
[192].

only effective at reducing NOX, but also can effectively oxidize organic
pollutants. At present, V2O5 and WO3 are most commonly used in SCR
catalysts supported on TiO2, due to their high activity to nitrogen oxides
and high resistance to sulfur dioxide poisoning [193]. Field tests of
CFPPs have confirmed that the SCR device has a certain synergistic
removal ability for organic pollutants, which is mainly due to the cat-
alytic oxidation effect of the SCR catalyst. To verify the catalytic activity
of conventional SCR catalysts for organic pollutants, Delaigle et al. [142]
evaluated the removal of benzene and chlorobenzene over single-phase
catalysts (VOx-TiO2) and a bi-phase catalyst (VOx-W/MoOx-TiO2). The
results showed that the introduction of WOx or MoOx significantly
improved the catalyst’s activity above that of the single-phase catalyst,
so that the removal efficiency for benzene (at 300
C) and chlorobenzene
(250
C) reached more than 95 %. In addition, they found that the
bi-phase catalyst exhibited optimum activity when the ratio of MoOx or
WOx to VOX was 1:1, and prevented the formation of MoOx or WOx
microcrystals which are harmful to the catalyst’s activity [194]. Zhou
et al. [195] prepared V2O5/TiO2 nanofiber catalyst with an acetone
removal efficiency of over 90 % at 300
C by combining electrostatic
spinning and hydrothermal growth. Yelverton et al. [184] tested the
removal performance of the honeycomb V2O5 titanium dioxide-based
catalyst for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated di-
benzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and in the process were able to achieve a
maximum removal efficiency and degradation rate of 97 % and 90 % at
220
C, respectively. Chen et al. [196] synthesized V2O5-WO3/TiO2
catalyst by one-step impregnation method achieving very high oxidation
efficiencies (91–99 %) for benzene and toluene at 420
C in fixed-bed
reaction.

◦

From the above studies, the optimum oxidation temperature of a
catalyst differs greatly and is dependent on the type of organic pollutants
in a gaseous stream. The flue gas in the SCR device used in a CFPP is
exposed to temperatures ranging from 260 to 380
C, and some organic
pollutants will not be removed by the SCR catalyst. Therefore, the ability
of a SCR catalyst needs to be improved to efficiently remove as many
kinds of VOCs as possible at these SCR devices’ operating temperatures.
Current studies using specific groups of metals to be identified below,
have been shown to effectively improve the performance of SCR cata-
lysts beyond what is achieved by the group of catalysts mentioned above
[197,198]. The catalysts include transition metal and rare earth metal
oxides, such as CuO, MnOX, CeO2, and CrO2. Among them, cerium oxide
is the most prominent because of its ability to strongly interact with
it generates abundant oxygen vacancies, and it has
other metals,
excellent oxygen storage capacity. Chen et al. [43] used cerium oxide to
modify the V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst for the removal of benzene and
toluene. They found that the optimum removal temperature dropped
from 420
C. In addition, the modification of molybdenum
oxide showed a similar trend, to that shown in Fig. S12.

In practical applications, the performance of a catalyst will be
defined by the synergetic removal effect for organic pollutants by the
SCR catalyst, which is not only limited by the specific temperature range
in a SCR device, but also by the extent the catalyst can resist the deac-
tivation effect of particulate matter, SO2, and water in flue gas. Chang
et al. [199] tested the removal efficiency for PAHs by a commercial SCR
catalyst and found that the efficiency could reach a value of 72 %. They
also explored the effects of particulate matter, heavy metals, HCl, and
SO2 on the catalytic performance of the SCR catalyst and found that the
presence of particulate matter on the catalyst surface slightly inhibited
the oxidation of PAHs, because the particulate matter increased the
carbon content on the catalyst’s surface. In addition, they mentioned
that the inhibiting effect of SO2 on the performance of the catalyst was
stronger than that of HCl in the gas phase, mainly due to the formation of
sulfate on the surface of the catalyst, which leads to poisoning and
deactivation of the catalyst. Chang et al. [199] also found that the
presence of the heavy metal cadmium (2 % by mass) had an effect of not
only deactivating the catalyst, but also of promoting the formation of
total PAHs. On the other hand, the presence of lead in a catalyst

increases the active site of the catalyst, and in this case, results in a
removal efficiency of 85 %. Ji et al. [200] investigated the effect of the
presence of water on the removal of PCDD by the SCR catalyst and found
that moderate amounts of water vapor (3 %, by mass) could enhance the
oxidation by dechlorination and hydroxyl radical generation. However,
when excess water vapor (8 %, by mass) was introduced into the system
the water vapor acted as a diffusion blocker, because of the ability of
water molecules to form clusters. These clusters occupied the active sites
and changed the surface acidity which reduced the catalysts’ catalytic
activity [201,202].

The above results confirm that the deactivation of the SCR catalyst
can occur mainly due to the influence of SO2 and the heavy metals in the
coal-fired flue gas, where the concentration of SO2 can usually exceed
500 ppm [203]. Therefore, SCR catalytic modification to improve SO2
resistance has attracted wide attention. Currently, there are three ap-
proaches for improving the resistance to SO2: (1) Adding metals such as
Fe, Co, Cu, Nb, Ca, Mo, Cr, La, Ni, Sn, and Gd to the active component of
a catalyst, to improve the SO2 tolerance of the catalyst. This approach
takes advantage of the synergistic effect between the additives and the
active component of a catalyst; (2) Controlling the structure and
morphology of the catalyst. For example, a multi-shell catalyst was
prepared by Cai et al. [204] and the spherical shell protective layer was
constructed by using Fe2O3 as the metal oxide, which are able to inhibit
the formation of sulfates by preventing SO2 from contacting the active
component of the catalyst [205]; (3) Acidizing the catalyst. Sulfate
formation is inhibited by changing the surface acidity of the catalyst
[206–208]. At present, developing catalysts with good sulfur dioxide
tolerance for industrial applications remains a challenge. The rapid
development of theoretical calculation (such as density functional the-
ory and machine learning analysis) also can contribute to our under-
standing of the possible routes by which sulfur dioxide may be oxidized
[209].

5.2.2. Catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants

◦

With the increase in renewable energy and natural gas power gen-
eration, a large number of coal-fired units will be operated at low loads
(<50 %). This will reduce the inlet flue gas temperature of the SCR
device to 260–280
C, and the activity requirements of the catalyst will
be further increased. It is very important to develop catalysts that have a
high activity at low temperature. In addition to the improvements made
to existing SCR catalysts for VOCs oxidation, the development of other
types of catalysts has also received extensive attention. Accordingly, the
active components of a catalyst for organic pollutants can be divided
into three categories, including noble metal catalysts (i.e. Pt-, Pd- Au-
based catalysts), non-noble metal catalysts (i.e. Mn-, Cu-, Co-, Ni- and
Ce-metal oxides), and mixed metal catalysts. Supported noble-metal
catalysts are favored because of their high performance in removing
VOCs at low temperatures. However, due to their high cost, poor ther-
mal stability, and poor resistance to sulfur, chlorine, and water, they are
not used in large scale operations such as CFPPs. Therefore, this section
mainly focuses on the removal performance of organic pollutants by
non-precious metals and mixed metal catalysts. To start, Table S9 pro-
vides a list of organic pollutants found in flue gas from CFPPs and the
corresponding effective catalyst, their structural properties, operating
conditions, activation energy, and the removal efficiency of the listed
effective catalyst.

C to 620

The temperature at which the VOCs conversion efficiency reaches 90
% (T90) is generally used as the basis for evaluating a catalyst’s perfor-
mance. Based on the data collated in Table S9, the removal temperatures
for typical organic compounds in coal-fired flue gas can vary from
137
C. And, in this temperature range many organic pollut-
ants of concern can be formed, with different molecular weights, vapor
pressures, and attached functional groups. Current research shows that a
catalyst’s activity is mainly determined by the type of active component
of the catalyst, the type of support, and the method used to prepare the
catalyst. These three parameters are elaborated below.

Transition metals contain Cu, Mn, Cr, V, Ce, and Co and these metals
have good oxidation activities for different types of organic pollutants
[13,210]. Of the catalysts available for use, manganese-, cerium-, and
cobalt-based catalysts are the most widely studied. As shown in
the
Table
manganese-based catalysts showed a higher activity for benzene,
toluene, xylene, acetone and chlorotoluene. This is mainly due to the
co-existence of mixed valence Mn2+
with lattice
oxygen which will promote the migration of lattice oxygen. The increase
in oxygen mobility will increase catalytic activity [211]. These catalysts
can be easily prepared and because their synthesis cost is relatively low

Cerium, is the most abundant element among rare earth elements
and its oxides have more oxygen vacancies and a strong oxygen storage
capacity. The ability of cerium to cycle between Ce3+
is an
important additional feature which is the reason cerium is often used as
the critical component or structural and electronic promoter of hetero-
geneous catalysts [212]. Also, cerium oxide has a strong interaction with
other metal elements and enhances its reducibility and dispersion [213].
These characteristics will make it an excellent catalyst active component
and metal accelerant or carrier.

and Ce4+

Co3O4 is also one of the most active and inexpensive metal catalysts
and its high activity is mainly related to the presence of mobile oxygen
inside the catalyst’s spinel type structure. As a result, the catalyst has
high reducibility, more oxygen vacancies and a high concentration of
electrophilic oxides. However, the activity of Co3O4 catalyst is mainly
dependent on the preparation method, treatment condition, oxidation
state of the Co, and the catalyst surface area. A high specific surface area
and a larger oxygen vacancy ratio, will increase the catalytic oxidation
performance for the target compound [214].

Compared to catalysts containing a single active component, which
were discussed above, catalysts prepared by mixing catalysts containing
two or more active components have recently received much attention
[215]. The active components in these catalysts have a higher degree of
dispersion than found in single active component catalysts, due the
interaction between the different active metals in the component
mixture during the synthesis of the catalyst [216]. As a result, such
the
catalysts exhibit a high catalytic activity and stability. Of
mixed-metal catalysts, Mn-Ce oxides, Mn-Co oxides, Mn-Cu oxides, and
Co-Ce oxides showed the highest performance of the metal catalysts and
displayed excellent catalytic activity. In conclusion, optimizing the
performance of the active components in a catalyst is an important step
in the process of efficient removal of organic pollutants.

The catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants is a typical gas-solid
reaction, mostly occurring on the surface of the catalysts. Therefore,
to prepare such a catalyst, the active components are loaded on a sup-
port with a rich pore structure, as this will improve the dispersion of the
active components and increase the reaction contact area. The proper-
ties of the support surface, including the pore structure, surface chem-
istry, and morphology, could directly affect the activity of the catalyst.
In addition, choosing the right catalyst carrier can also reduce the
amount of expensive active components needed in a catalyst, thus
reducing the cost of the prepared catalyst. Currently, excellent catalyst
supports include Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2, Montmorillonite, zeolite, and
carbon-based materials. Li et al. [217] synthesized microporous and
mesoporous carbon spheres (MCS) using a hard template combined with
the sol-gel method as support of the Co2O3 catalyst. The removal per-
formance of ethylene was compared with that of coconut-based acti-
vated carbon (CC), silica gel (SG) and active aluminum (AA) as the
support catalysts, as shown in Fig. 13. The results indicate that Co2O3
loaded on MCS showed the best activity, by completely converting C2H4
at temperature of 185
C, which is much lower than that produced on CC
(200
to the
three-dimensional mesoporous frame structure of the MSC, which is
beneficial for the dispersion of Co2O3 particles in the MSC structure and
helps reduce the pore diffusion resistance of the VOCs molecules. The
well-developed pore structure of MSC contributed to the increased cat-
alyst’s activity. In a related study, Díaz et al. [218] found that the CaX
zeolite skeleton with low acidity and high crystallinity supported by
MnO2 showed good hexane removal performance. The MnCaX was able
to convert 50 % of the hexane (air carrier gas) at a temperature of
281
C required
when MnNaX was used as a catalyst.

The catalyst support not only affects the activity of a catalyst, but
also plays a key role in the water tolerance of the catalyst. Although
water will not poison the catalyst, the competitive adsorption between
water and the VOCs present will decrease the catalyst’s activity [219].
Compared with metal support, current studies have shown that acti-
vated carbon and molecular sieves are good hydrophobic supports,
mainly due to the presence of various surface functional groups, such as
carbonyl, quinone, hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups, etc. These func-
tional groups can be modified by introducing hydrophobic groups,
thereby enhancing the hydrophobic properties of carriers. Chen et al.
[220] modified γ-Al2O3 support with inorganic siloxane, and the
oxidation efficiency of o-xylene in simulated flue gas with 5 % water
vapor was only reduced by 5 %, which was better than 26 % of the
unmodified catalyst. The hydrophobic surface of the catalyst can greatly

inhibit the adsorption of water, thus promoting the release of more
active sites which enables adsorption of the target organic matter, thus
ensuring efficient catalytic activity. Excellent support is particularly
important for catalyst activity and tolerance.

(3) Preparation method.

At present, a variety of preparation methods are used in the synthesis
of single-component and multi-component catalysts, which lead to great
differences in the structure, morphology, and therefore in the perfor-
mance of a catalyst. The methods include the precipitation method
(MP), the sol-gel method (SGM), the hydrothermal method (HTM), and
the impregnation method (IM). Of these methods, the precipitation
method is the most commonly used method for preparing Mn-Ce cata-
lysts, and is divided into a co-precipitation method and a redox pre-
cipitation method [221]. The co-precipitation method involves using a
chemical that will cause the precipitation of the metal ions in an alkaline
solution (such as NH4OH, (NH4)2CO3, and NaOH) and then the precip-
itated solids are calcined in a furnace in an air atmosphere, which is the
final step involved in preparing the catalyst, as shown in Eqs. (6) and (7).
On the other hand, the redox precipitation method uses KMnO4 as the
oxidant to oxidize in the metal oxides additives Mn2+
in an
alkaline solution to generate Mn-Ce mixed oxides. The reaction is shown
in Eq. (8) [222].

Hence, the catalytic activity of the catalyst prepared by the redox
precipitation method is significantly superior to the co-precipitation
method mainly due to the finer catalyst particles produced, higher
dispersion of metal additives, and higher specific surface area of the
catalyst produced. However, the co-precipitation method is more suit-
able for industrial applications, because the catalyst preparation cycle is
shorter and the cost is lower.

Another method used for preparing suitable catalysts is the so-gel
process which involves wet chemical synthesis of nanoparticles. In
general, the sol-gel method involves dispersing the active components in
a solvent, and then using a catalyst to promote hydrolysis and poly-
merization reactions leading to the formation of a gel with a certain
spatial structure. For example, Lu et al. [223] prepared nano-catalyst
materials by the sol-gel method, dissolving KMnO4 into a mixed solu-
tion of sodium nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid. And then, the

catalyst was obtained after the aging of the gel produced from the
synthesis of the nanoparticles, followed by a drying step (to remove
C. Compared with the
water and volatiles) and then heat treated at 120
precipitation method, the catalysts produced by the sol-gel method have
active metal components which are better dispersed and catalysts with
larger specific surface areas.

◦

The hydrothermal method is another synthesis approach used for
catalyst preparation. It involves the reaction of an active component
such as solvent in water, the use of an organic solvent, or a mixture of
solvents to produce the catalyst from the synthesis of single crystals of
pure materials soluble in water or other aqueous media, in a closed
vessel, under high temperature and pressure [224]. During the prepa-
ration procedure, the structure and morphology of the catalyst can be
regulated by changing the reaction environment (PH value, solution
concentration, etc.) to produce a catalyst with small particle sizes and
better dispersion of active components.

The impregnation method involves impregnating a specific support
in a solution of reagents containing active components to allow the
metal ions to attach themselves to the support. This step is followed by
drying and calcination to obtain the target catalyst. Although, the
impregnation method is simple to perform and is inexpensive, certain
types of supports would need to be used. Zhou et al. [225] selected
activated carbon as the catalyst carrier, which was placed in a container
to which dissolved cobalt nitrate and manganese nitrate solution in
distilled water were added. The catalyst was then synthesized by
completing the remaining steps using a typical impregnation method.
After performing impregnation step, the remaining liquid was removed,
and then the carrier catalyst with highly dispersed active components
was obtained after drying, calcination and activation processes.

As to the advanced catalyst preparation method,

it has been
continuously explored, with the ultimate goal of achieving the highest
possible activity and a high yield. Other considerations are that catalyst
preparation would involve simple steps, have a low cost, and can be
scaled up.

5.2.3. Adsorbent for capturing organic pollutants

Among the many methods for removing VOCs, the adsorption
method is considered to be one of the most promising of methods
available because of its low cost, high efficiency, and operational flexi-
bility. Two types of adsorbents have been widely used for removing
VOCs from industrial waste gas, where injection type adsorbents are
used with the injection technology and regeneration type adsorbents are
used in fixed-bed downflow reactors. Fly ash, zeolite, and activated
carbon are examples of excellent injection type adsorbents with good
adsorption performance and are also inexpensive, as shown in
Table S10. For example, pilot tests and field adsorbent injection tests
showed that the removal efficiency of TVOCs by the adsorbents can vary
between 20 % and 65 % [178,227]. The properties, operation condition,
and adsorption capacity of reported adsorbents for typical VOCs
removal are summarized in Table S11. In addition, based on the data in
Table S11, the relationship between specific surface area and pore vol-
ume on adsorption capacity was explored, as shown in Fig. 15. Generally
speaking, of the adsorbents for VOCs, MOF type of adsorbents have
exhibited higher adsorption capacities than the zeolites under normal
experimental conditions (e.g. in an atmosphere of O2 and N2). However,
considering how complex a flue gas composition can be, there are still
some key problems in the practical application of adsorbents. For
example, the high temperature and humidity in the flue gas significantly
reduced the adsorption performance of the adsorbent tested [228] and
the presence of a variety of VOCs and flue gas components can also hurt
the selectivity and performance of an adsorbent after it is regenerated
[229].

Regenerative adsorbents such as hypercrosslinked polymeric resin
(HPR) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are two high-performing
adsorbers. They were tested in a fixed-bed reactor and both were
found to have almost completely captured the VOCs flowing into the
reactor [230–232]. These adsorbers were easily regenerated, which is
very important due to the high cost of using MOF and HPR in an in-
dustrial setting. The following section will discuss how to evaluate the
performance of injection adsorbents using as criteria adsorption rate,
selectivity, operating temperature range, and ease of regeneration.

5.2.3.1. Injected-adsorbents.

(1) Adsorption rate

The adsorbents are injected into the flue gas to remove VOCs mole-
cules by adsorption, and the ESP device will capture the adsorbent

particles and the particulate matter in the flue gas. The injected adsor-
bent usually stays in the flue gas for only a few seconds, so the
adsorption rate is one of the important factors in judging the effective-
ness of an adsorbent, so that an adsorber with a high adsorption rate will
help capture VOCs in flue gas more effectively. Current studies have
shown that the adsorption process can be divided into three stages: (1)
external diffusion where the VOC molecules approach the surface of the
adsorbent particles by convection, axial dispersion, and particulate
diffusion; (2) internal diffusion, where VOCs molecules move into the
pores of adsorbent; (3) Adsorption equilibrium, where VOC molecules
are adsorbed on the surface of the pores within the adsorbent particles,
by several mechanisms, such as Van Der Waals force, π-complexation, H-
bonds, and electrostatic interaction. In general, the first two adsorption
stages depend mainly on the specific surface area and the structure of the
adsorbent [233]. For adsorbents of the injected type, the mass transfer
rate in the internal pore diffusion stage is the dominant factor affecting
the adsorption rate [227]. The abundant mesopores and macropores in
an adsorbent are very beneficial to the intra-granular diffusion of ad-
sorbates, this improves the mass transfer rate and accelerates the
removal rate of organic pollutants. Therefore, finding ways to increase
the proportion of mesopores and macropores of an adsorber material
during the preparation process is an important approach to improving
its adsorption rate.

The pores of a typical adsorbent, such as activated carbon are mostly
in the microporous range (<2 nm), which may slow down the migration
rate of VOC molecules into the activated carbon structure. In addition,
the irregularly shaped pores in the activated carbon adsorber increase
the diffusion resistance to the adsorbate (VOC molecules) during the
adsorption process, resulting in a longer time to reach the adsorption
equilibrium [234,235]. The pore structure of activated carbon can be
controlled by the preparation process. Generally speaking, the source of
activated carbon is usually coal and wood. Coal-based activated carbon
is mainly prepared by a physical activation method (steam activation
method, carbon dioxide activation method) and the specific surface area
is mostly between 400–1000 m2/g and the pore size is microporous with
diameters mostly below 1 nm. Wood-based activated carbon is mainly
prepared by a chemical activation method. The chemical methods
include potassium hydroxide activation method, phosphoric acid acti-
vation method, and zinc chloride activation method. These methods
produce activated carbons with specific surface areas ranging between
1000–3000 m2/g and activated carbons with different pore size distri-
butions. For example, the pore size of activated carbon prepared by the
alkali activation method contains mainly micropores below 2 nm,
whereas the pore size of acid activated carbon contains both micropores

below 2 nm and abundant mesopores of about 2–5 nm, and its total pore
volume is also significantly higher than that of activated carbons pre-
pared by other activation methods [236–238]. Ng et al. [239] obtained
carbon nanospheres, porous carbon nanospheres, and hollow carbon
nanospheres (HCN) using a one-step KOH chemical activation method,
as shown in Fig. 16. Their results showed that HCN exhibited an
excellent adsorption capacity and the highest adsorption rate for the
three VOCs (ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and methanol). This was mainly
attributed to the larger specific surface area of the hollow structure of
HCN, which increased the external diffusion rate. In addition, porous
carbon with a regular hierarchical pore structure has a lower intra-
molecular diffusion resistance for VOCs compared with single sized
porous carbon, thus accelerating the adsorption process [240].

Compared with activated carbon, zeolites have lower VOCs adsorp-
tion capacities and slower adsorption kinetics, mainly because the pore
sizes of traditional zeolites are mainly concentrated below 1 nm
[241–243]. This limits the internal diffusion of VOCs molecules in the
pore structure. To overcome this obstacle, Kim et al. [244] prepared
extra-large/super-pore zeolites (Φ > 1 nm) and demonstrated that the
breakout time of the zeolites increased gradually with the increase of the
zeolite micropore diameter. In addition, other researchers were also able
to increase the adsorption properties and mass transfer rate of the zeolite
they prepared, by reducing the crystal size of the zeolite material to
nanostructures (i.e., nano-zeolites) or by forming additional mesopores
on zeolites crystals (mesoporous zeolites). Compared with ACs and ze-
olites, fly ash has a lower specific surface area (<10 m2/g) and pore
structure. In order to improve the pore structure, fly ash was mecha-
nochemical modified, generating a large number of fresh surface and
mesoporous structures, which increased the adsorption efficiency of
toluene in a fixed bed reactor by 1.5–2.3 times [178]. To obtain better
inter-channel uniformity, Liu et al. [245] performed low temperature
heat treatment on the template of an ordered mesoporous silica adsor-
bent (Kit-6) at 200
C. Dynamic adsorption test results showed that the
presence of a uniform pore size distribution significantly improved the
pore diffusion rate.

◦

In summary, specific surface area and pore size distribution play an
important role in improving the adsorption rate and performance of
adsorbents for organic pollutants in the flue gas. The data in Table S11
for the adsorption performance of adsorbents for organic pollutants in-
dicates an overall positive correlation with specific surface area (R =

0.737) and pore volume (R = 0.731), as shown in Fig. 15. A larger
specific surface area can not only increase the adsorption capacity, but
also the adsorption rate. For pore size distribution, mesopores (2–50 nm)
and macropores (>50 nm) are better than micropores in improving the
adsorption rate, but the improvement in adsorption capacity is mainly
attributed to micropores (<2 nm). Therefore,
the uniformity of
adsorption pore size is particularly important.

(2) Selectivity.

The pore structure characteristics of adsorbents not only affect the
adsorption rate, but also plays a key role in the catalyst’s ability to
selectively adsorb different types of VOCs. Based on the discussion in
Section 4.2, it showed that a variety of VOCs having different molecular
structures are detected in a coal-fired flue gas. The molecular structure
of the adsorbent chosen to capture the VOCs will largely determine its
adsorption capacity [246]. This can explain why activated carbon with
well-developed micropores has a better adsorption capacity for small
VOC molecules (kinetic diameter less than 1 nm) than for large VOC
molecules [247]. The presence of a predominance of micropores will
hinder the pore diffusion by mass transfer of VOCs with large molecular
sizes. This would explain why in a related study, Qian et al. [248] and
Huang et al. [249] both found that the adsorption capacity of AC and
MOFs was negatively correlated with the molecular size of the VOCs
(Fig. 17) and illustrated the importance of designing an adsorber to
include mesopores for adsorbing VOC molecules with large kinetic di-
ameters, as had previously been shown by the work of Schnelle and
Brown [250]. Before ending this section on injected adsorbents, one
needs to remark that there is still a need for a simple, efficient, method of
preparing adsorbents with a suitably designed pore structure distribu-
tion to improve the adsorption rate and capacity.

(3) Medium-high temperature.

The high flue gas temperature is one of the serious challenges for
injected adsorbents when they are used to capture VOCs in coal-fired
flue gas, considering that the ones in use today are designed for room
temperature environments. Since the injected sorbent particles in the
gas flowing into an ESP would need to be captured by the ESP to avoid
located

downstream of it, the sorbent would be exposed to operating tempera-
◦
tures ranging between 90 and 120
C, comparable to the flue gas at the
inlet of the ESP [178]. Current studies show that the adsorption of VOCs
can occur by physical adsorption (Van Der Waals force) and chemical
adsorption (π-complexation, H bonding, and electrostatic interactions).
As the temperature is increased, the VOCs will have higher kinetic en-
ergy, and that could reduce the chance of their being attached to the
adsorption sites of the adsorber resulting in a lower performance. Tsai
et al. [251] compared the adsorption characteristics of chloroform on
commercial activated carbon (Cl) (520 m2/g), two types of activated
carbon fibers (F1 and F2) (460 m2/g), and a sludge adsorbent (S1) (495
m2/g) at different temperatures. In a fixed bed reactor, they found that
when the temperature of the adsorption process was raised from 30 to
80
C
C, the values of the adsorption capacity of adsorbate at 80
decreased from that at 30
C for the adsorbate concentration range
(ppm) tested, as follows: 7–67 % for Cl, 17–38 % for S1, 5–74 % for F1,
and 12–42 % for F2, respectively. The decreasing trend was more sig-
nificant as the concentration of all the adsorbate (VOCs) was decreased.
A similar observation regarding the effect of temperature was also re-
ported by Ma et al. [252], who used activated carbon as adsorbers to
capture two aromatic compounds. They reported that toluene and
chlorobenzene decreased from 49.9 mg/g and 80.3 mg/g to 20.6 mg/g
and 30.5 mg/g when the flue gas temperature at the injection location
was increased from 90
C, respectively. They concluded based
on these results that at the higher flue gas temperatures the physical
adsorption performance of the adsorbents was significantly reduced.

C to 150

◦

Understandably, as the temperature of the flue gas is increased
physical adsorption is not favored, because the VOC molecules are
moving at a higher velocity in the flue gas stream, which will diminish
the probability of these molecules being adsorbed in the pores of the
activated carbon by the weak forces of attraction. However, as the
temperature is increased more energy is provided to the gaseous flow,
which can promote the chemical reaction between the VOC molecules
and the adsorbent –for chemical adsorption to compensate for a
reduction in physical adsorption, sufficient chemical bonds with the
VOCs need to be formed. Therefore, the ideal adsorber should have the
same high efficiency of adsorption within the applied range of injection
temperature. This can be achieved by having oxygen and nitrogen
containing functional groups on the surface of an adsorbent, including
phenolic hydroxyl, carboxyl, lactone, carbonyl, amino, imide and pyri-
dine or pyridine-like groups. These functional groups provide active
sites for reaction with VOC molecules. Because the chemical bonds
formed are stable and difficult to break even at high temperatures, en-
sures a stable adsorption efficiency. Compared with zeolite and FA, the
surface functional groups of ACs were easier to modify by liquid phase
oxidation, gas phase oxidation, and by chemical impregnation con-
taining nitrogen oxides [252].

Since the adsorption performance is determined by the combined
action of physisorption and chemisorption, the inhibition of physical
adsorption and the promotion of chemical adsorption of a adsorbent
within an operating temperature range should not be a source of
concern, provided the expected overall performance of an adsorbent in
the control device meets the reduction target value set by the facility.

5.2.3.2. Regenerative-adsorbent. At present, no field experiments have
been carried out on the treatment of VOCs in coal-fired flue gas using
regenerative adsorbents. The experiments were mainly undertaken in
laboratory fixed bed flow reactors and small pilot scale platforms. The
experimental results showed that the initial adsorption efficiency of
various adsorption materials for VOCs could almost reach 100 % [253,
of
254].
adsorption-regeneration ablation of pores occurs, and surface active
sites are destroyed, which leads to a decline in the adsorbent’s efficiency
for removing VOCs in a flue gas stream. The use of supplements or
replacing the adsorbent will increase the operating cost. Therefore, high

adsorption capacity, good hydrophobicity, and a high regeneration
performance are key parameters to consider when evaluating regener-
ative adsorbents.

(1) Adsorption capacity

The adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mainly depends on the
physical and chemical properties of the material. Li et al. [246] reviewed
the adsorption capacity of various adsorption materials for VOCs and
found that MOFs exhibited the best performance, followed by ACS, HPR,
and zeolite. Similar results were also reported by Xian et al. [255], who
found that the adsorption capacities of MIL-101 for 1, 2-dichloroethane,
ethyl acetate and benzene were 960.9, 510.2, and 293.7 mg/g, respec-
tively. Related studies have confirmed that adsorption capacities for
MOFs are much higher than those of ACs and zeolites. The MOFs are
porous materials assembled by coordinated interactions between metal
ions and organic ligands, forming adsorbents with ultra-high porosity
and an average specific surface of 2653 ± 1640 m3/g based on 14 kinds
of MOFs [246]. In addition, through the selection of solvents (such as n,
n-dimethylformamide, n, n-diethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, etc.)
and the adjustment to the synthesis method, the pore structure and the
type and number of functional groups attached to the adsorbent can be
accurately controlled. These advantages allow MOFs to exhibit the best
adsorption performance, about 1.7, 5.8, and 2.1 times higher than that
of AC, HPR and zeolites, respectively.

(2) Hydrophobic performance

◦

It is common practice to place the adsorption bed after the FGD unit,
which would expose the adsorbent to lower flue gas temperature con-
ditions (40–60
C). However, coal-fired flue gas contains a high-water
vapor content, especially inside a FGD unit where the relative humidi-
ty can be around 80 %. These water vapor molecules can quickly occupy
part of the adsorption sites on the sorbent, creating hydrogen bonds with
the polar functional groups on the surface of the sorbent, resulting in a
decline in the VOCs capture performance [256]. Therefore, the evalua-
tion of the hydrophobic property of an adsorption material that is to be
used in a FGD unit is essential for evaluating its applicability. Current
research results show that HPR adsorbents have the best hydrophobic
performance among many adsorbent materials due to the presence of
very few chemical functional groups on their surfaces. Wang et al. [257]
prepared a superhydrophobic HCP with a specific surface area of 1345
m2/g by a one-step Friedel–Crafts reaction. The experimental results
showed that the adsorption capacity of HCP for benzene was 124.2 mg/g
at a relative humidity of 30 %, which is lower by less than 10 %
compared with HCP prepared under dry conditions. In contrast to HCP,
the surface of activated carbon contains a large number of C-O func-
tional groups [258], the surface of zeolite has a large number of hy-
droxyl groups attached, and the skeleton of MOFs has a large number of
unsaturated metal sites and ligands of hydrophilic functional groups.
These hydrophilic adsorption sites when exposed to a humid gaseous
environment were responsible for a significant decrease in VOC
adsorption capacity, between 20 and 40 % [259]. In order to enhance
the hydrophobic capacity of such materials, much research work has
been carried out. In the case of ACs, several commonly used modifica-
tion methods are used, which include heat treatment, alkali modifica-
tion and hydrogen treatment [260,261], since the adsorption of water
vapor is inhibited mainly by reducing surface hydrophilic functional
groups [262]. However, for Zeolites the approach is to weaken the
acidity of the material, which is achieved by increasing the Si-Al ratio
and silanization, which will also enhance the hydrophobicity of the
adsorbent [263,264]. However, for MOFs, there are several approaches
with promise. They include enhancing the hydrophobic properties of the
adsorbent, promoting synthesis/coordination of N bonding with metal,
ligand functionalization, surface modification based on the core-shell
model, and post-synthesis ligand/metal exchange [265,266].

(3) Regenerability

A potential regenerative adsorbent need to have a high regenerative
performance as this will directly affect the operating cost. Currently, the
commonly used adsorbent regeneration methods include thermal
regeneration, ultrasonic regeneration, and microwave regeneration
[246]. The physical and chemical structure of an adsorbent will inevi-
tably change during the regeneration process, so that the adsorption
performance of the material will decline with the number of regenera-
tion cycles, irreversibly. Li et al. [246] reviewed the regeneration per-
formance of various adsorbents and found that zeolite showed the best
regeneration performance, followed by AC, HPR, and MOFs, as shown in
Fig. S13. The uniform and regular pore distribution of zeolite helps to
lower the amount of energy needed for the regeneration process, so that
the desorption temperature used can be as low as 150
C, which is also
dependent on the type of adsorbate involved [267]. In contrast, AC has a
rich number of micropores, which makes it difficult to desorb the
adsorbate, resulting in a limited degree of regeneration. This was also
confirmed by Su et al. [268], who found that the temperature for
complete desorption of the adsorbent was above 300
C. In addition to
the pore shape and size activated carbon contains a large number of
active sites with previously adsorbed VOCs. Therefore, the applied
desorption energy must also overcome the activation barrier of the
adsorbed pollutants.

◦

◦

The adsorption capacity of HPR and MOFs was greatly affected by
the desorption/adsorption cycle. After 5 cycles, the adsorption capacity
decreased to 83.6 % and 80.9 % of the original adsorption capacity,
respectively. This is mainly because the pore distribution and functional
groups in HPR and MOFs are prone to change at high temperatures,
which leads to poor adsorption performance. There is evidence that the
regeneration performance of adsorbent materials has been significantly
improved by low temperature technologies, such as nonthermal plasma
[269], microwave-assisted [270], and ultrasound-assisted regeneration
[271].

Whether injected-adsorbents or regenerated-adsorbents are used to
remove organic pollutants from coal-fired flue gas, the impact of flue gas
composition (H2O, SO2, and particulate matter) and the scale of pro-
duction must both be considered. The effect of flue gas components on
the adsorption of VOCs by adsorbents is summarized in Table S12. The
findings indicate that the presence of water vapor, SO2, and fly ash in-
hibits the adsorption of VOCs and the corresponding inhibition effi-
ciencies are: for water vapor (9.56–58.6 %); SO2 (2.80–10.5 %); and fly
ash (5.63–19.8 %) [229,272–277]. This shows that the maximum
inhibitory effect of the flue gas components on the adsorption of VOCs in
Table S12 occurred in the following order: water vapor > fly ash > SO2.
The possible influence mechanisms are summarized as follows.

(1) Water vapor: At low relative pressure, water vapor can be
strongly adsorbed on the polar functional groups on the surface of
the adsorbent
through hydrogen bonding, preempting the
adsorption site of VOCs [278]. At high relative pressure, adsorbed
water molecules tend to form clusters and block the pore struc-
ture of the adsorbent, thus affecting the transport and diffusion of
VOCs. More importantly, the inhibition increases as the polarity
of the target VOCs increases.

(e.g., carboxyl,

lactone, phenol hydroxyl)

(2) SO2: The effect of SO2 on the adsorption of VOCs on adsorbents is
similar to that of water vapor. SO2 can be adsorbed by polar
groups
through
hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions [279]. Then it
forms a competitive adsorption relationship with VOCs, resulting
in a decrease in the adsorption capacity of VOCs. The polarity of
water is much stronger than that of SO2, which also leads to the
inhibitory effect of SO2 being significantly lower than that of
water vapor. In addition, the molecular size of SO2 is smaller than
that of VOCs, making SO2 more inclined to adsorb in
ultra-micropores (<0.7 nm) [274]. VOCs such as toluene are

more inclined to adsorb in microporous structures of 0.7–2 nm.
This means that a reasonable design of the pores will greatly
weaken the inhibitory effect of SO2.

(3) Fly ash: The negative effect of fly ash on VOCs adsorption is
mainly due to the blockage of the larger pore structure of
commonly used adsorbents such as zeolites and AC, interrupting
the transport of target VOCs molecules from large pores to mi-
cropores. Therefore, the presence of fly ash will not only reduce
the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent, but also lower the
adsorption rate [275]. It is worth noting that the fly ash also has a
certain adsorption capacity, which enables the fly ash to adhere
to the surface of the adsorbent, thus adsorbing a small number of
VOCs. However, the pore structure and the number of adsorption
sites in fly ash are far less than those of the adsorbent, resulting in
an aggravated downward trend in the adsorption capacity of the
adsorbent as the fly ash content increases.

In summary, the regulation of functional groups on the adsorbent
surface and the regulation of the pore structure are keys to weakening
the inhibitory effect of water vapor and SO2. Methods such as silaniza-
tion modification of zeolite [264,273] and introduction of N-metal co-
ordination in MOF materials [280] have been used to inhibit the
adsorption of water vapor and SO2. Trace potassium-assisted catalytic
activation strategy [277] and reverse template method [281] have been
used to prepare hierarchical pore adsorbents. In order to weaken the
effect of fly ash on adsorption performance, the fly ash on the adsorbent
surface can be removed by physical methods such as spraying, blowing,
and vibration.

For large-scale controllable preparation of adsorbents, zeolite FA,
and AC have been achieved due to the availability of raw materials and
the fact that the preparation methods were not too involved. From the
cost of adsorbents summarized in Table S10, it can be seen that fly ash
and slag adsorbents have the best cost advantage (<50 USD/ton), fol-
lowed by zeolite and activated carbon adsorbents, with comparable
costs (<5000 USD/ton). In contrast, MOFs and HPR are 3–4 orders of
magnitude more expensive. The high cost and low yield limit the in-
dustrial application of MOFs and HPR adsorbents. Although the intro-
duction of preparation methods using electrochemistry [282], flow
chemistry [283], mechanochemistry [284] and continuous processing
[285] have greatly increased the types of adsorbents produced, among
which the extrusion method can make the space-time yield of ZIF-8
reach 144,000 kg/m3/day [286], it is still not possible to reduce the
price of the above two adsorbents to less than 10 USD/kg. The cost of
using them to remove organic matter from the flue gas in an industrial
facility is going to be quite high.

Several studies involving field scale coal-fired units and pilot scale
units were identified, but only fly ash and activated carbon have been
applied to remove by adsorption the organic pollutants. The adsorbent is
injected as a spray into the flue gas to capture the organic pollutants in
the gas stream, before the dust removal unit. The used adsorbent is
captured by an ESP device or FF device, desorbed and regenerated at
high temperature, and then recycled into the flue gas after high tem-
perature desorption and regeneration [287]. Zhang et al. [288] used
with positive results modified fly ash as an adsorbent to remove mercury
from the flue gas of a commercially operated 300 MW CFPP. After the
application of the adsorbent, the mercury removal efficiency reached
~87.8 % when the amount of modified fly ash rate was 188 kg/h. Under
the same test conditions, the synergistic removal efficiency of NMHCs in
flue gas can reach 20.7 % [178]. Notably, the FA used here was modified
by NaBr-coupled mechanochemical method to enhance the adsorption
performance of mercury. To enhance the VOCs removal performance,
binary oxides of Ce-Mn were supported on fly ash using facile mecha-
nochemical synthetic method involving a solid organic acid ligand
[289]. The pilot scale tests were performed in a drop furnace and the
results indicated that the VOCs removal efficiency can be increased by
more than 80 % [290]. The last two studies are aimed at further

improving the VOCs removal efficiency in field scale coal-fired units. Ma
et al. evaluated of the removal performance of VOCs in flue gas by AC
injection coupled with a bag filter (ACI + BF) on a pilot scale unit with a
total flue gas flow rate of 120 m3/h. When the amount of activated
carbon was 1.42 g/m3,
the removal efficiency of six VOCs was
21.2–53.8 %, and the removal efficiency of phenol reached 59.8 %
[227]. In addition to adsorbing the adsorbents in the flue gas, the sor-
bent injected into the flue gas could be captured by the bag filter to form
a sorbent layer, which plays an important role in VOCs adsorption. In
another study related to the adsorption of low-concentration organics,
Ma et al. [291] evaluated the removal performance of organic pollutants
by AC injection in 300 MW and 660 MW coal-fired units, and the results
showed that when the AC injection volume was 150 mg/m3, the removal
efficiency of THC, VOCs, and SVOCs varied between 36 and 46 %,
15–50 % and 45–90 %, respectively. The above results show that the
adsorbent injection technology has a certain removal performance for
flue gas organic pollutants, but due to the influence of high temperature
and complex flue gas components, the removal efficiency has not yet
reached the optimal level —that was achieved in the laboratory.

At present, activated carbon is considered an ideal adsorbent based
on the results of Szulejko et al. [292], who evaluated four typical ad-
sorbents (carboxen 100, AC, MOF, tea lees) based on four sorbent per-
formance metrics
space velocity,
regeneration cycles, and cost). However, FA with improved adsorption
performance, also, MOFs and HPR with lower cost and large-scale
controllable preparation are equally attractive for industrial-scale
operations.

5.3. Novel organic pollutant control technology

5.3.1. Non-thermal plasma (low-temperature)

Low-temperature plasma technology (NTP) uses high-energy elec-
trons (2–20 eV), free radicals (O⋅, H⋅, O3, and ⋅OH), and active particles
generated during the gas ionization discharge at high voltage. This re-
sults through a series of inelastic collisions with the background mole-
cules in a gaseous environment, triggering a series of reactions resulting
in the release of secondary electrons, photons, ions, and radicals. The
active free radicals produced can effectively oxidize VOCs molecules. In
general, this occurs in two broad steps: (1) VOCs molecules directly

interact with high-energy electrons producing H2O, CO2, and other
substances, as a result of a series of dissociation and ionization reactions;
(2) High-energy electrons react with N2, O2, H2O and other molecules in
the gas phase to generate strong oxidizers such as ⋅O, ⋅OH, O3, and active
particles which can break the molecular bond in the VOCs and lead to
the final decomposition and oxidation of the VOCs molecules to produce
CO2 and H2O [293]. Recent results show that the NTP is undoubtedly a
very effective technology for reducing toxic gases in air or in a flue gas
[294,295]. The non-thermal technology has also been evaluated and
validated by the U.S. EPA, and the experimental results for VOCs
removal show that the total removal efficiency of p-methyl ethyl ketone,
benzene, and toluene is greater than 90 % [296]. However, in the pro-
cess of investigating the reaction mechanism, they found that the
degradation of VOCs molecules was accompanied by the generation of
harmful pollutants such as ozone (O3), CO, and NOx.

To overcome some of the above problems, Yao et al. [297] used low
temperature plasma combined with a catalyst (MnOx/zeolites) to
deoxidize the VOCs. Combining a catalyst with a high activity with one
with a high selectivity for the oxidation of VOCs with the NTP tech-
nology will result in a lowering of the activation energy required for the
reaction to occur, which will speed up the reaction at the NTP-plasma
generated temperature. Also, the presence of a catalyst promotes the
generation of micro-discharges and facilitates the initiation of plasma
reactions, resulting in higher discharge capacity and energy density than
those obtained with NTP alone. Whereas, the NTP modifies the structure
and chemical properties of the catalyst active substance, increasing the
surface area and particle size dispersion, and improving the stability and
activity of the catalyst [298]. The aforementioned actions encourage
efficient VOCs mineralization and degradation, and reduce the pro-
duction of by-products in the NTP accompanying catalytic system.

The current research results show that the NTP combined with the
catalyst is beneficial for achieving complete degradation and oxidation
to CO2 and H2O with a high removal efficiency of the VOCs. In addition,
increasing the selectivity of CO2 and reducing the generation of harmful
by-products are the main reasons why this technology has received
widespread attention.

5.3.2. Advanced oxidation process (AOP)

Considering that the adsorption method for the treatment of organic
pollutants requires subsequent treatment and thermal catalytic treat-
ment of the intermediate by-products of the desorbed organic pollutants,
the use of an advanced oxidation process (AOP) for the degradation of
VOCs, as an alternative to a process based on adsorption and oxidation
has received extensive attention. AOP has shown to be an effective
•(cid:0)
method that can generate various free radicals, such as HO• and SO4
,
which can rapidly oxidize organic pollutants. UV photocatalysis is one of
the most widely used AOP. Common photocatalysts are mainly metal
oxides or sulfides, such as TiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, SnO2, WO3, CeO2, Fe2O3,
Al2O3, ZnS and CdS [299]. TiO2 is an example of a material which can
produce positively charged holes under the action of ultraviolet light.
These holes are generated by the valency electrons which are excited by
the energy applied jump from the valency band into the conduction
band.

(cid:0)
The positively charged holes in TiO2 can oxidize HO

or water on the
surface of TiO2 to produce HO•, which can then oxidize the gaseous
pollutants. However, the high maintenance costs caused by catalyst
deactivation limit the large-scale application of UV photocatalysis for
degrading VOCs in the coal flue gas, which has a high humidity and
complex composition. The use of a wet scrubber combined with AOP to
remove VOCs in combination with existing APCDs in CFPPs was pro-
posed as a solution. The concept diagram of the processing system is
shown in Fig. 18. The system mainly uses UV light energy to activate the
oxidant (e.g. H2O2) into highly reactive free radicals. Then, when the
flue gas flows through the wet strip washer the organic pollutants are in
full contact with the active free radicals in the liquid phase, thus
achieving complete degradation of the VOCs. Common oxidants used in

the process include H2O2, O3, peroxymonosulfate (PMS), PDS (perox-

radicals when UV light energy is applied is as follows [300,301]:

Xie et al. [302] evaluated the removal efficiency for toluene and
ethyl acetate using a wet scrubber combined with a UV/PMS system, and
determined that the maximum removal efficiency that they were able to
achieve was 96.5 % and 98.3 %, respectively, as shown in Fig. 19(a and
b). Under the action of UV light energy, large amounts of sulfate radicals
•(cid:0)
) and hydroxyl radicals (HO•) were produced by the PMS system,
(SO4
which efficiently degraded the VOCs in the gas flow. A comparison of the
adsorption rate for VOCs showed that HO• was more effective at
•(cid:0)
and Cl• were more effective at
oxidizing ethyl acetate, while SO4
degrading toluene. An analysis of the intermediate products suggests
that a possible reaction path leading to toluene degradation can be

and HO• in extracting H
explained in terms of the roles played by SO4
from toluene, followed by hydroxylation, ring opening, and minerali-
zation, forming CO2 as shown in Fig. 19 (c).

In another study, Xie et al. (2020) investigated the chlorobenzene.
degradation performance using a wet scrubber combined with UV/H2O2
and UV/PDS. Their results show that the degradation efficiency of
chlorobenzene by these two systems was high, between 90 % and 95 %.

However, the synergistic effects of SO4
when the UV/PDS system shorten the degradation pathway of chloro-
benzene, producing a yield of CO2 that was much higher than that of the
UV/H2O2 system – (75.4 % vs 42.0 %). Based on the PTR-TOF-MS results
of chlorobenzene oxidation intermediates, the possible pathways for the
oxidation of chlorobenzene using UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS are shown in
Fig. S14. In the UV/H2O2 system, chlorophenol (substance C) was

to produce Cl

substitution
formed when chlorobenzene was oxidized resulting in HO
of one H atom on the aromatic ring. Further hydroxylation products
(substances F, G) will be produced, followed by ketonated and ring-
opening reactions, thus forming carboxylic acid or form aldehyde
•
compounds, which can be further oxidized by HO
, CO2
and H2O. However, in the UV/PDS system, the electron extraction re-
•(cid:0)
action between SO4
and the aromatic ring is the initial step in the
oxidation of chlorobenzene, producing substance B as shown in Fig. S14.
The deep oxidation pathways of substance B mainly depend on the ox-
ygen content, where pathway I corresponds to conditions in which ox-
ygen is absent and pathways II and III correspond to conditions in which
oxygen is present. The final oxidation products are consistent with the
UV/PDS system. In order to further verify the feasibility of an AOP for
removing organic pollutants, Prostˇejovský et al. [303]evaluated the
removal performance of p-xylene by AOP (UV/O3 system) in a pilot
plant, indicating that the removal efficiency of p-xylene reached a value
of 95 % when the flow rate was 57 m3/h and the initial concentration of
p-xylene was 50 ppm.

Considering that the existing pollutant control equipment in a CFPP
includes either a high efficiency mist eliminator or a wet electrostatic
precipitator, the improvement in performance from adding a spray
system-AOP to remove organic pollutants from flue gas is expected to be
small. On the positive side, there is much evidence that the use of an
AOP can effectively remove SO2, NO, and Hg0 in the flue gas at the same
time [304–307]. Therefore, AOPs will likely be more broadly applied as
a new more efficient technologies are developed for the removal of
organic pollutants from flue gases generate from coal combustion.
However, there are still some problems that need to be addressed when
using, for example, a spray system-AOP - such as the low recovery rate of
the oxidant and the low recycling efficiency of the waste water in wet
scrubber. The efficient utilization of the oxidants and the control of
metal ion generation in the catalytic process are directions for future
research.

In this section, the control technologies for organic pollutants in

CFPPs were reviewed, both during coal combustion and after combus-
tion has occurred. For the removal of the organics during the combus-
tion process, reasonable optimization of combustion conditions and fuel
conditioning were the two most economical and effective approaches.
The addition of metal oxides was found to significantly improve the
combustion efficiency and to reduce the amount of PAHs available for
release into the atmosphere, and in some cases the reduction in PAH
amounts caused by the metal oxides reached 40 %. A means of reducing
the organic pollutant produced during the combustion process can be
achieved by optimization of the combustion conditions and by fuel
conditioning, which represent two most economical and effective ap-
proaches. Once pollutants are formed, they would need to be reduced.
The addition of metal oxides was found to significantly improve the
combustion efficiency and to reduce the number of PAHs available for
release into the atmosphere, and in some cases, the reduction in PAH
amounts caused by the metal oxides reached 40 %. In contrast, another
technology, the NTP-assisted combustion technology inhibited the
generation of VOCs through the production of free radicals and O3.
However, the high equipment and operating costs limits the large-scale
application of this technology. Similarly, coal gasification technology
faces the same problem, which is the high cost of wastewater purifica-
tion treatment.

The activities for the removal of organic pollutants after combustion
can be divided into four approaches: (1) Making improvements to
existing SCR catalysts. For example, doping the support with Ce and Ge
metal oxides lowered the optimum activation temperature of the SCR
catalyst for removing the different kinds of organic pollutants in a
gaseous stream. In addition, the SCR catalytic response to the toxic
deactivation due to the presence of acidic gases, and heavy metals in the
flue gas was improved by adding metal-containing additives, using
catalysts with optimized structures, and applying an acidification
treatment (More details are included under Sec.5.2.1.).

(2) Enhancing the oxidation performance of a catalyst. The effects of
the active components, carrier types, and preparation methods on
the catalytic activity for oxidizing the organic pollutants were
described in section 5.2.1. For example, Mn, Ce, and Co in single
component catalysts showed excellent oxidation performance.
The synergistic interaction between the components of a catalyst
can further promote the oxidation process. Zeolite molecular
sieve a good choice for a catalyst carrier because of its thermal
stability, pore structure, hydrophobic performance, and low cost
makes. Among the preparation methods, the use of the hydro-
thermal method produces zeolites with higher activity, and the
precipitation method is better suited for industrial production,
because it involves a simple process and it only takes a short time
to regenerate the catalyst.

(3) Using adsorbents. Types of adsorbents can be divided into
injected adsorbents and regenerative adsorbents. They are eval-
uated based on their adsorption rate and selectivity. In addition,
the adsorption performance at medium and high temperatures is
emphasized for injected adsorbent. Activated carbon, zeolite and
fly ash are ideal adsorbent materials that can be injected due to
their low price and micro-mesoporous pore size distribution. For
the regenerative type of adsorbents, adsorption capacity, hydro-
phobicity, and regeneration performance are factors of consid-
eration. Hence, HPR and MOFs are more often used as
regenerative adsorbents because of their strong hydrophobicity
and excellent adsorption capacity.

(4) Applying novel organic pollutant control technologies. NTP with
catalyst technology and AOP are regarded as promising tech-
nologies for the degradation of organic pollutants in recent years.
Both can achieve removal efficiencies of more than 90 %, but the
installation of NTP devices and the huge power consumption
limits their application to large-scale operations. Correspond-
ingly, an AOP can effectively remove organic pollutants with the

help of the injection equipment added to an APCDs in a CFPP, and
thus has a broader application prospect.

(5) Coal devolatilization and PAH and soot formation.

Emissions from a coal combustor depend on the fuel type used, the
type of burner/furnace used, and the combustion conditions, since these
parameters will affect the devolatilization rate and the nature and the
amount of the volatiles (tar and gaseous species). Most of the tar that is
produced from coal particles is converted into soot particles, although
the soot formation in pulverized coal flames needs to be fully understood
[308]. The flame produced by burning pulverized coal will contain
zones where the devolatilized material such as PAHs is fully mixed with
oxygen and other zones where oxygen is available in low amounts or not
well mixed with a fuel component and pyrolysis results in mainly free
radical, some of which will grow to larger more stable PAH and VOC
molecules. Some of these gaseous materials will condense or be adsor-
bed on soot particles in the gas phase or become part of the carbona-
ceous material enclosing ash particles as was explained in a previous
section of this paper. Several methods were reviewed for removing PAHs
from the gas stream using APCDs. The results show that the effect on
PAH formation does not appear to be straightforward, since in some
cases the concentration of PAHs at the exit of a SCR increased rather
than decreased. Understanding how PAHs and carbonaceous materials
are formed can help in reducing the amounts formed. It can also identify
what needs to be done to increase the amount of carbonaceous materials
captured by an ESP and to identify the kind of additional equipment that
is needed. Earlier studies show that soot formation in pyrolysis and
flame systems occurs by similar processes and PAHs are the most
important molecular species via which soot forms and grows. Soot also
grows with smaller molecules such as acetylene. The rate of growth of
soot is greatly dependent on the available surface area for growth than
on the amount of growth species. The anti-soot effect of additives is due
to the oxidation of important hydrocarbon species such as PAH as well as
the oxidation of the soot particles themselves [309]. Since then much
work experimental work has been done using new experimental and
quantitative modelling of small molecules [310]. Recently, several
mechanisms have been used to explain the formation of these pollutants:
HACA, HAVA, MAC, and PAC type reactions. Though the role of acet-
ylene is recognized as a molecular building block and H- as important for
chain branching and flame propagation in e.g, the HACA mechanism,
there is evidence that “nascent” soot can increase in size without
gas-phase H atoms being present [311]. The fact that PAH formation is a
process with a “high degree of reversibility” suggested that the path
from PAH to soot would proceed via a resonance stabilized molecule
[310]. Therefore, it is reasonable to accept that PAHs can be formed by
many more routes than those mentioned in this paper considering the
different combustor configurations, fuels used, flame temperatures, and
in addition, the detailed chemistry for the volatile matter during com-
bustion is not yet available [308,310].

6. Conclusions and further works

As an important part of anthropogenic emission sources of organic
pollutants, stationary coal-burning sources cannot be ignored. This work
provides a critical review of recent research on organic pollutants from
stationary coal-burning sources, including coal content and occurrence
forms of organic pollutants in coal, organic pollutants transformation
during coal combustion, sampling, co-removal and emission of VOCs,
PAHs, and CPM in CFPPs, organic pollutants removal technologies for
CFPPs. Based on these studies, the outcomes are summarized below.

1) Formation mechanism of organic compounds during coal combus-
tion: The origin and distribution of organic compounds in coal are
largely determined by the coal grade, biogenesis, and the sedimen-
tary environment. Accordingly, the concentration of PAHs increases
with coal rank reaching the highest level in bituminous coal, and

then the concentration of PAHs decreases with the further increase of
anthracite maturity. The formation and emission characteristics of
organic pollutants during coal combustion can be described by a
pyrolysis (oxygen starved stage) stage and a combustion stage. The
pyrolysis stage is mainly affected by temperature, coal heating, and
devolatilization rate, the species evolved, residence time, and the
operating pressure. The materials produced at a given heating rate of
C/ms (CDS Analytical Pyro–probe 5250) vary with temperature:
20
most of the VOCs released at 300–600
C were mainly alkanes, al-
kenes, aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols. With the increase in
pyrolysis temperature, the main compounds changed from alkanes to
aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the released concentration of
PAHs showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing within
the temperature range from 400
C, and reached a
maximum at 800
C. For the combustion stage, the emission of
organic compounds is mainly affected by the design and configura-
tion of the burner, the heating rate, and the excess air coefficient. The
tangential burner arrangement is more conducive to coal ignition
than the hedge type, resulting in more rapid combustion and a sig-
nificant reduction in the emission of VOCs. A cross-scale study,
involving a fixed-bed, drop-tube furnace and coal-fired boiler, indi-
the concentration of organic pollutants produced
cated that
increased with the increase in heating rate, while the concentration
of halogenated hydrocarbons increased slightly with the decrease of
excess air ratio (fixed-bed: <100
C/min, drop-tube furnace:
C/s, coal-fired boiler: 105 ◦
2000
C/s). Because combustion in a
fluidized bed could occur at a temperature below that of a conven-
tional coal-fired boiler, the PAHs emission concentration of fluidized
bed boilers is higher than those from coal-fired boilers. The above
research results can provide technical support for the source reduc-
tion of organic pollutants in CFPPs.

2) Sampling of organic pollutants in coal-fired stationary sources:
Sampling methods and conditions will significantly influence the
final results and that should be one of the factors to consider when
comparing results performed in different studies. The characteristic
high temperature, high dust, and high humidity of coal-fired flue gas
are factors that can affect the accuracy of sampling. Higher flue gas
temperature requires special materials for the sampling probe and
that the sampling gas path be air tight. Field sampling and analysis
results show that the organic pollutants in a coal combustion process
are mainly composed of VOCs, PAHs, and organic components of
CPM. Therefore, the diversity of organic contaminants in coal-fired
flue gas makes it challenging for a single sampling technique to
analyze the full spectrum of components. Several typical sampling
methods for VOCs, PAHs and CPM were summarized in this review
and their advantages and disadvantages were compared. For sam-
pling VOCs, PAHs, and CPM, US EPA Methods 0031, 0010, and 202
are three methods that are commonly used, respectively. In addition,
numerous improvements have been proposed to enhance the preci-
sion and applicability of the existing standard sampling methods,
such as adding a multi-stage adsorption tube to remove water vapor
from flue gas in Method 0031, the addition of a post-filter membrane
to increase the capture efficiency of CPM in Method 202, etc. Proper
selection and optimization of a sampling method will help to obtain
accurate emission data of organic pollutants from a CFPP.

3) Emission characteristics and co-removal of organic pollutants from
CFPPs: Field test results show that the concentration ranges of VOCs,
PAHs and CPM emitted by CFPPs are 0.01–16.29 mg/m3, 0.42–43.3
μg/m3, and 5.90–65.1 mg/m3, respectively. In addition to the dif-
ferences in coal, combustion devices and conditions, the most
important reason for such a large difference in the emission con-
centration of organic pollutants is the difference in the APCDs system
of CFPPs. In addition to removing conventional pollutants such as
NOX, SO2 and PM, the APCD (SCR, ESP, FGD, and WESP) can exhibit
a synergistic removal effect on the organic pollutants in a flue gas.
Also, the selection of the appropriate catalyst in a SCR unit can

◦

achieve VOCs removal efficiencies between 64.4 and 84.4 %.
Although, ESPs are known to have high capture efficiencies for
particulates in the flue gas, the removal efficiency for PAHs entering
ESPs varies within a large range (45.6–97.6 %, by mass), possibly
due to the effect of flue gas temperature. The use of a LLT-ESP system
C, producing
allows the flue gas temperature to drop to around 90
an increase in the amount of CPM, which is then removed by the
modified ESP. The results show that the removal efficiency for CPM
by a LLT-ESP system can reach values ranging from 69.7 to 83.5 %,
and the capture efficiency of inorganic components is higher than
that of the organic components. However, the VOCs removal effi-
ciencies of ESPs range between 12.5 and 36.3 %. The lower efficiency
is attributed to the electrostatic effect in the ESP causing fine parti-
cles to separate from the surface of larger particles, so that some
VOCs absorbed by fly ash are released back into the flue gas. In the
FGD system, after washing, condensation and gypsum adsorption,
the removal efficiencies for VOCs, PAHs, and CPM in the flue gas can
vary: 16.1 %, 16.0–41.4 %, and 9.4–63 %, respectively. The efficient
capture of sub-micron particles by the WESP device further reduces
the content of PAHs and CPM, with removal efficiencies ranging
between 3.7-91.2 % and 42.0–60.0 %, respectively. However, the
VOCs removal efficiency is low (~8.7 %), which is attributed to the
oxidation of O, OH, O3, and other free radicals generated in the
WESP discharge process. A review of the recent research indicates
that APCDs equiped with modern technology can reduce the
amounts of VOCs, PAHs, and CPM by 55.8–87.6 %, 74.7–89.8 %, and
36.3–81.5 %, respectively.

4) The technology for control of organic compounds from coal-fired
stationary sources: The removal of organic pollutants in the coal
combustion process focuses primarily on VOCs and PAHs. Two ap-
proaches were used to reduce the organic pollutants at the source.
Coal conditioning (co-combustion of bituminous coal and biomass)
increased the removal efficiency significantly for VOCs. However,
the efficiency can vary for individual pollutants: for chloromethane,
carbon disulfide and m/paraxylene the removal efficiencies were
73.5 %, 26.7 %, and 64.4 %, respectively. Another approach
involved adding metal oxides (e.g., 5 % by mass, waste iron slag) to
the coal combustor to reduce PAHs. The removal efficiencies also
varied (15.4 %–44.5 %) depending on the operating parameters.
Several methods have been used to remove organic pollutants from
the gas flow downstream of the combustor. The first approach in-
volves using improved SCR catalysts that have significantly higher
oxidation efficiencies in existing APCDs. These catalysts are made up
of metal oxides and rare earth metals such as MoOx, CuO, MnO2,
CeO2, and Cr3O4. They also involve preparing multi-shell catalysts
with controlled structure and morphology, to enhance the reduction
effect on acid gases and heavy metals. The second approach used
involves developing efficient catalysts for the oxidation of organic
pollutants into COx and H2O, and improving the oxidation activity of
supported non-noble metal catalysts using selecting: the active
components, the preparation method, and a carrier with desired
properties. The third approach involves the use of adsorbents to
capture organic pollutants, such as AC, zeolite, MOFs and HPR. The
adsorption capacity of VOCs was found in the following order: MOFs
> HPR > AC > zeolite. HPR and MOFs have shown to have excellent
hydrophobic properties and excellent adsorption capacities, and are
more suitable as regenerative sorbents. AC and zeolites have high
adsorption rates, a micro-mesoporous structure, a price advantage,
and are more suitable as injected adsorbents. Combining NTP with
catalyst technology or combining a wet scrubber with AOP tech-
nology are both considered promising organic pollutant degradation
approaches. Accordingly, an AOP can effectively remove organic
pollutants by using the spray equipment of an APCD system in a
CFPP, thus expanding the potential application of this setup.

The authors recommend that more targeted studies, as outlined

below, to lay the groundwork to further our understanding of organic
pollutant emissions and to find new ways of efficiently controlling them
in CFPPs.

1) For identifying the types of organic compounds in coal, the choice of
extraction agent and extraction method is crucial. The extraction
method for PAHs in coal is relatively mature at present, whereas the
extraction yield for other organic compounds is low. Advanced
extraction technology and combined extraction using multiple sol-
vents merit further attention.

2) For organic pollutants formation and emission during coal combus-
tion, many of the published studies focus on the effects of coal type,
combustion temperature, and residence time on the formation of
organic pollutants in the laboratory using thermogravimetry or
combustion reactors. The results of these laboratory studies although
useful, they cannot be considered to be directly applicable to the
combustion conditions of coal-fired power plants without additional
research. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct additional research on
the effect of representative combustion conditions on the formation
of organic contaminants in coal-fired units, such as conducting pilot
tests accompanied by multi-point simultaneous sampling, devel-
the high-
oping in-situ sampling and analysis methods
temperature zone of the furnace.

for

3) For organic pollutants sampling, the standard method is primarily
intended for flue gas leaving the CFPPs, which cannot be applied to
the monitoring the flue gas inside a boiler. The research and devel-
opment of in-situ sampling technology in the combustion process can
reveal more directly the mechanism of organic pollutant formation
and support emission reduction at the source.

4) For organic pollutants co-removal and emission in CFPPs, the
following aspects require additional research: developing a detailed
understanding of the transformation or removal mechanism for
VOCs, PAHs, and CPM across each APCD; exploring ways to improve
the oxidation rate of VOCs and inhibit the amount of PAHs generated
in a SCR; indicating the influence of CPM organic components on its
condensation rate; and seeking ways to improve the efficiency of the
control units in a APCD for removing CPM.

5) For organic pollutants removal technologies for CFPPs, further
research includes increasing the selectivity of the modified SCR
catalyst for VOCs and PAHs; using machine learning to explore ways
of modifying the adsorption performance of injection adsorbents for
capturing organic pollutants under high flue gas temperature con-
ditions (100–150
C), and exploring the stability and secondary
release characteristics provide a basis for subsequent treatment;
conducting more field experiments to verify the feasibility and
applicability of WFGD combined with AOP for organic pollutants,
and further enhancing the recovery efficiency of oxidants.

◦

The extensive research work presented here and recommendation for
areas that need more research directions are also expected to be used for
reference by coal-burning industries and users of residential combustors
to effectively reduce organic pollutant emissions.

process design and the Unit Operations laboratory. He developed one of the first programs
in the US where undergraduates were offered the opportunity to take up special projects to
study fuel combustion and fuel emulsions, and to develop software for performing
chemical engineering process design calculations. The generated formal reports helped a
number of students identify their career interests and helped to target their job interviews.
He authored and co-authored publications on coal pyrolysis, coal combustion, coal
ignitions, and supercritical extraction of coal; on polymer ignition and degradation; a
review of soot formation and the effect of additives (for the NSF in D.C); reviews of US and
international standards for air; He developed a new approach for data collection and
presentation of industrial emissions and co-developed emission factors for welding oper-
ations. This is a brief summary of a long journey that started with Mohamed’s first
employment as a B.Sc graduate at the National Research Center in Cairo. His present
affiliation is the Triangle Speakers Group.
