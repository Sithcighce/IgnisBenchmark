Capturing CO2 from air (DAC) is becoming an attractive technological route to face the climate crisis. This paper
reviews the existing research efforts to integrate DAC with conversion technologies to transform the captured
CO2 into chemicals or fuels. The approach can potentially lead to net zero carbon emissions, thus being of interest
in a circular economy framework. A growing amount of research has been devoted to the combination of DAC
with CO2 conversion, leading to creative strategies which start to be scaled up. In this review, we have critically
analysed  the  existing  approaches  by  the  degree  of  process  integration.  From  the  point  of  view  of  process
intensification, the integration of both capture and reaction in the same vessel can potentially lead to equipment
and energy cost savings besides other synergistic effects. In this vessel, the DAC and conversion can occur either
in consecutive stages with change of feed or spontaneously in a cascade reaction without changing the condi-
tions. As a side effect, the benefits entailed by process intensification in different levels of integration may be a
decisive driving force for the widespread deployment of  DAC. This  paper discusses  the ongoing research and
perspectives to guide researchers in this promising new field.

1. Introduction

The CO2  emissions  continuously rise  due to the increase of  global
energy demand, reaching 36.6 Gt CO2  in 2022 [1]. As a consequence,
CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is growing at a pace of 2.4 ppm per
year during the last decade [2], exceeding on average 420 ppm in 2022
[3]. One of the main concerns of the current times is the global warming
due to anthropogenic emissions. CO2 accounts for about 60% of global
warming effects [4]. The 2015 Paris Agreement established the objective
◦
of acting to keep the average temperature increase below 1.5
C. In this
context, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC) high-
lighted  the  importance  of  reaching  net  zero  CO2  emissions  by  2050,
pursuing a dramatic decrease of CO2 emissions after 2030 [5]. In addi-
tion to the climate consequences, increased CO2 levels can have serious
human health risks [6]. To meet these reduction objectives, the focus has
been directed towards fossil-free renewable energy sources. However,
renewable energy and the decarbonisation of the main industrial sectors
(i.e.,  fossil-derived energy, cement,  steel and chemical industries) are
not  enough  to  meet  this  target,  making  negative  CO2  emissions
necessary.

The  sources  of  CO2  can  be  either  stationary  sources  (e.g.  power
stations, biogas, cement, oil refining and petrochemical industries) or
diffused  sources  (i.e.  transportation,  natural  emissions).  In  stationary
sources, it is relatively easy to deploy systems to capture CO2  either at
pre-combustion, during combustion or post combustion. However, it is
not feasible to install CO2  capture systems in diffused sources such as
cars,  heavy  duty  transport  or  aviation,  which  represent  about  half  of
total anthropogenic emissions [7]. Great advances have been made in
the electrification of light vehicles using batteries. However, there are
significant infrastructural and technological challenges to electrify other
modes  of  transportation  such  as  heavy  duty  transport  and  aviation,
which accounts for approximately 14% of global greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions [8]. Due to space constraints, these means of transport require
high  volumetric  energy  density  which  cannot  be  easily  achieved  by
batteries  or  H2  but  is  fulfilled  by  fossil  fuels  or  bio-jet-fuels.  Thus,  to
mitigate atmospheric CO2 emitted from diffuse sources, solutions lead-
ing  to  zero  or  negative  carbon emissions  are  necessary.  The  main  re-
ported  approaches  leading  to  negative  carbon  emissions  [9]  include
natural  solutions  such  as  afforestation  or  enhanced  weathering  and
engineered  solutions  such  as  bioenergy  coupled  to  carbon  capture,

direct ocean capture (DOC) [10] or direct air capture (DAC) coupled to
permanent  carbon  immobilisation.  DAC  is  one  of  the  preferred  ap-
proaches  for  negative  emissions  since  it  has  the  lowest  impact  to  the
environment due to the limited use of land and water [11]. DAC enables
the capture to be independent of the emission sources. Moreover, DAC is
a unique way to reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere which has
been accumulated by emissions in the past. In fact, models have fore-
casted that CO2  capture from stationary sources, leading to zero emis-
sions, is not enough to reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Thus, point
capture  and  DAC  are  not  excluding  each  other  but  both  are  comple-
mentary.  In  the  short  term,  carbon  capture  from  stationary  sources
should be deployed to avoid the emissions. In a medium term, DAC is
necessary to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, emitted
mainly by diffuse sources. For all this, recently there is a high motivation
to develop highly efficient technologies to implement DAC [12,13]. One
of the most important issues related to the CO2 capture (point sources or
with DAC) is what to do with this CO2. The conventional approach is to
store it in the subsoil (CCS) as demonstrated for the carbon capture from
point sources [14] or from air [15]. Another interesting alternative is to
use the captured CO2  as raw material (CCU) for the synthesis of mole-
cules of interest such as chemical compounds and construction materials
[16,17]. The highest impact on CO2 utilization will be achieved when it
is converted into products of high demand such as construction mate-
rials (concrete or aggregates) [17,18] or fuels [19]. The conversion to
construction materials, such as concrete, can potentially lead to negative
emissions (carbon dioxide removal, CDR) as occurs for CCS while the
CCU to fuels leads to neutral emissions, as long as the CO2 conversion is
carried out with renewable energy, thus being a cornerstone of a circular
carbon economy.

The integration of CO2  capture with subsequent conversion is very
interesting  because  it  can  lead  to  process  intensification,  which  is
defined  by  Stankiewicz  and  Moulijn  as:  “any  chemical  engineering
development  that  leads  to  a  substantially  smaller,  cleaner,  and  more
energy-efficient technology”  [20]. In this review, first, we will briefly
revise the existing methods for DAC and subsequently the integration of
DAC with technologies for conversion into fuels, mainly C1 (i.e., mole-
cules with one carbon atom such as methane) through catalytic tech-
nologies.  There  is  a  significant  number  of  reviews  dealing  with  the
integration of CO2 capture from combustion and process flue gases (CO2
concentrations 5–30 %) and the subsequent conversion of captured CO2
[5,21–25] but revisions about the integration of DAC with conversion
are scarce. To the best of our knowledge, we only spotted two reviews
[26,27]  that  are  related  to  DAC  and  conversion  somehow,  which
appeared during the writing of this review. The review of Erans et al.
[26]  put the emphasis  on DAC including a few considerations on the
conversion as well. The second review [27] deals intensively about DAC
technology and it only deals succinctly about the in-situ CO2 utilization,
addressing techno-economic and life cycle assessment of different cap-
ture  technologies  as  well.  In  this  article,  we  will  review  briefly  DAC
technologies  (section  2),  to  subsequently  focus  extensively  on  the
different levels of integration between DAC and conversion technologies
(section 3). This section is organised by type of reaction and products
and includes thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, which
is  not  addressed  in  other  previous  reviews.  We  conclude  discussing

briefly about techno-economic aspects of the integration of DAC with
chemical conversion (section 4).

2. Direct air capture

2.1. Technology for direct air capture: developments from a historical
perspective

The  technology  for  DAC  is  necessarily  different  from  that  used  in
post-combustion  carbon  capture  (PCC)  from  stationary  sources  (flue
gases) due to the characteristics of atmospheric CO2 (Table 1). In DAC,
CO2 concentration is significantly more diluted (400 ppm) than in PCC
(5–30 %), which makes the volume of gas to be treated larger and hence
the DAC equipment is capital intensive. The volume of air that contains
1 kg of CO2 is 1300 m3 while in a flue gas from natural gas plant it is 13
m3  [28]. Based on thermodynamic considerations, the minimum theo-
retical work required for DAC is 19–22 kJ/mol CO2, which is approxi-
mately  four-fold  higher  than  that  required  for  PCC  from  flue  gases
[29–32].  The  cost  of  DAC  in  the  literature  spans  over  one  order  of
magnitude,~100–1000€/tCO2  removed  [33].  The  large volume  of  air
flowing  through  capture  material  is  translated  into  high  energy  con-
sumption  for  fan  power.  In  addition,  the  regeneration  of  the  capture
media  requires  mechanical  and/or  thermal  energy  [33].  The  need  of
moving high volume of gases can be overcome by designs that allow an
effective  movement  of  gas,  for  instance  using  wind  and  the  use  of
structured  reactors  with  low  pressure  drop  [28].  Some  more  exotic
implementation strategies have appeared in the literature such as the
rail-based DAC [34]. These trains are equipped with large intakes that
collect CO2 feedstock air by fluidic, ramjet-type processes thus avoiding
the need for the fans required by land-based systems. The energy for the
process  is  supplied  by  regenerative  braking  and  solar  energy  imple-
mented in trains. The cost estimation for rail-based DAC is $45/tCO2
including increased fuel consumption while the estimated cost of con-
ventional DAC is about $70/tCO2.

On the other hand, DAC has some advantages over PCC. For instance,
it is more flexible in terms of location because DAC system can be placed
anywhere while PCC only at the emitting source. Another advantage of
DAC is that an specific throughput is not required [35]. The recovery of
CO2  in PCC should be high to avoid emissions and the optimization to
achieve  higher  throughput  entails  high  costs.  However,  there  are  not
emissions constraints for CO2 capture from air, that can have CO2 cap-
ture efficiency significantly lower than 90%. Therefore, the process can
be optimized minimizing the costs of equipment and energy per kilo-
gram of CO2 captured. On the other hand, contaminants in the flue gas
streams such as NOx, SOx, particulates and Hg are significantly lower in
air  avoiding  pollution  problems  or  the  need  of  gas  pre-treatments.
Therefore,  the  two  processes,  PCC  from  stationary  sources  and  DAC,
should  co-exist  in  the  near  future.  In  the  short  term,  PCC  should  be
implemented at large-scale stationary sources to limit emissions, but this
does not decrease the high levels of CO2  already present in the atmo-
sphere, which should be decreased by DAC and other CDR technologies.
According to Shi et al. [36], DAC may play six important roles for net
zero CO2 emissions:

1.  Neutralizing CO2 emissions from mobile sources;
2.  Moving CO2 storage to remote sites;
3.  Offering  leakage  insurance  recapturing  CO2  leaked  from  CCS  or

geologic CO2 storage sites;

4.  Closing the carbon cycle through the conversion to synthetic fuels;
5.  Supplying a carbon feedstock for other industrial processes;
6.  Establishing negative emissions.

DAC was firstly introduced by Lackner in 1999 [37]. In the following
years,  many  studies  appeared  highlighting  the  importance  of  DAC
technologies to reduce the atmospheric CO2 levels [35,38–45]. After the
introduction of the DAC concept, the number of scientific publications
has increased exponentially in the last decade. Recently, several review
papers [36,46,47] have been published dealing with CO2  capture sor-
bents, which can be classified as liquid or solid.

◦

At the beginning, processes based in Na/Ca hydroxides to carbonate
cycles  were  proposed  [38],  based  on  technologies  used  in  the  Kraft
process in paper industry. However, this process is not feasible because
it  requires  very  high  temperature  (around  900
C)  to  regenerate  the
sorbent,  entailing  a  high  energy  consumption  [40].  After  these  first
technologies,  the  field  started  to  move  towards  alternative  processes
requiring less energy. Thus, adsorption processes, which need less en-
ergy  for  the  regeneration,  were  evaluated.  In  this  sense,  amine  func-
tionalized  adsorbents  are  the  most  promising  since  they  require  less
energy to regenerate than alkaline oxides/hydroxides which form car-
bonates.  For  instance,  quaternary  ammonium  ion-exchange  resins,
which capture CO2  by cycling between the bicarbonate and carbonate
forms,  can  be  regenerated  by  simple  exposure  to  moisture  at  45
C.
Using these resins, the energy requirements are 50 kJ/mol CO2 captured
and it was proposed that the process is feasible at a cost of $200/tCO2
[48]. Processes for adsorption of CO2 from air at room temperature have
recently been studied using silica-supported amines [49,50], which can
be regenerated with low-cost waste heat such as steam. Nevertheless,
amine-based systems have the limitations of toxicity, volatilization, and
oxidative degradation. Therefore, current research is focusing on solving
these problems of amine sorbents [51,52] and on the decrease of the
energy penalty of the regeneration of alkali hydroxide solutions [53].

◦

In the 2050 net zero emissions scenario, DAC is aimed to be scaled up
to capture more than 85 Mt CO2/year by 2030 and ~980 Mt CO2/year
by 2050 from almost 0.01 Mt CO2/year today [54]. Currently, 19 DAC
facilities are operating in Canada, Europe and the United States. This
level  of  deployment  will  require  several  more  large-scale  demonstra-
tions to optimise the technology and reduce the capture costs [55]. The
plans  for  investment  in  building  DAC  plants  is  increasing  in  the  last
years. For instance the US Congress authorized in late 2021 $3.5 billion
in funding to build four DAC hubs [56]. The first large-scale DAC plant of
up to 1 Mt CO2/year is in late-stage of development and is expected to be
operating in the United States in the next years. DAC is positioned to
play a critical role to meet the mid-century total carbon removal goals of
10–20  Gt  CO2/year  (also  including  capture  from  stationary  sources)
[57].  For  this,  it  is  necessary  to  reduce  the  cost  of  DAC,  for  instance
through  the  utilization  of  low-temperature  heat  or  other  renewable
energy sources. One of the highest cost factor is the regeneration of the
sorbent  [58].  Therefore,  significant  research  has  been  devoted  to
develop  cost-effective  methods  to  regenerate  the  sorbent  such  as
steam-stripping  [59,60]  or  temperature-vacuum  swing  adsorption
(TVSA) [61].

The ways to capture CO2 from diluted sources such as air have been
recently  reviewed  and  techno-economic  studies  have  been  performed
[27,30,62,63].  Despite  the  good  prospects  of  some  newly  developed
technologies for DAC, the studies did not provide detailed experimental
information and quantitative mass and energy balances. On the other
hand, there are several reports with detailed information that conclude
that  the  deployment  at  large-scale  of  CO2  capture  from  air  is  not
economically  feasible.  For  instance,  a  techno-economic  study  using  a
sodium-based  capture material [64] claimed that DAC will cost three

times more than other CO2 mitigation options such as renewable energy,
nuclear  power,  and  carbon  capture  from  large  CO2  emitting  point
sources.  These  assessments  are  performed  naturally  considering  the
available technology for CO2 separation in that moment which is not still
optimized.  However,  DAC  will  be  cost-competitive  when  inexpensive
renewable  energy  sources  are  available,  the  new  technological  de-
velopments reduce the costs of CO2 capture from air and the price of CO2
emissions rises as indicate current projections. In fact, despite the con-
troversy about the DAC economic-efficiency, a great research effort is
being devoted to reduce the cost of DAC by using less expensive ways to
regenerate  the  sorbents  and  improving  the  process  efficiency  [65].
Obtaining  a valuable product  by the conversion  of captured CO2  will
push  the  technology  further.  The  integration  of  CO2  capture  with
chemical conversion can entail also benefits in terms of process inten-
sification. In the reactive regeneration, the product is obtained simul-
taneously to the sorbent regeneration, reducing the energy consumption
and CO2 compression and transportation costs, thus making the process
more economically sustainable.

2.2. Current implementation schemes for DAC

Nowadays, the main technologies to capture CO2 from the air are of
two types: liquid and solid DAC (L-DAC and S-DAC, respectively). L-DAC
(Fig. 1) is based on two closed chemical loops. Aqueous alkali hydroxide
solutions  have  been  used  in  L-DAC  technologies  (i.e.  the  technology
developed by the company Carbon Engineering). In first stage at the air
contactor, an alkali hydroxide (such as potassium hydroxide) solution
reacts with CO2 to form alkali carbonate species in solution. This solu-
tion is then contacted with Ca(OH)2, to form CaCO3 precipitate which is
subsequently calcined to release CO2  and return CaO. CaO is slaked to
regenerate the Ca(OH)2 which is recycled. The calciner unit work at high
◦
temperatures (between 300 and 900
C) which is one of the energy-cost
penalties of this technology.

Contrarily,  S-DAC  (Fig.  2)  is  based  on  solid  adsorbents  (i.e.,  the
technology  used  by  the  company  Climeworks),  that  chemically  binds
CO2,  operating  through  an  adsorption/desorption  cycling  process.
Typically,  the  adsorbents  capture  CO2  at  ambient  temperature  and
pressure  while  they  are  heated  at  medium  temperature  (80–100
C)
under vacuum during the CO2 desorption which is subsequently stored.
The  energy  requirement  for  regeneration  using  amine  functionalized
adsorbents  accounted  for  76%  of  the  total  energy  demand.  A  single
adsorption/desorption  unit  has  a  capture  capacity  of  about  50  tCO2/
year.  In  addition,  water  can  be  also  extracted  from  the  atmosphere
where local conditions allow it. Early prototypes were able to remove
around 1 tonne of water per tonne of CO2. The water can be also useful
when other sources of water are scarce. A S-DAC plant is designed to be
modular and can include as many units as needed.

◦

S-DAC  and  L-DAC  have  different  characteristics  with  several  ad-
vantages  and  disadvantages  (see  Table  2).  Both  technologies  have
proven to be effective removing CO2  from the atmosphere (when the
CO2 can be permanently stored) or to be a source of climate-neutral CO2
for its use in the industry. These technologies can be installed at different
territories without competing with the food or bioenergy industries for
the  land use. Both  technologies have  different range of working  tem-
peratures and both technologies can be modular but the size of modules
is  larger  for  L-DAC  than  for  S-DAC  mainly  due  to  the  higher  re-
quirements of heat and water of the former [62]. The capacity can be
increased by sum up of modules. The capital and operational expenses
will be mainly related to the size of the plant, operational requirements
and  energy  needs.  From  the  operational  point  of  view,  to  operate
continuously, S-DAC requires parallel units some of them working in the
capture stage and some units in the regeneration stage. However, L-DAC
can operate continuously at steady state, except for maintenance. Both
DAC technologies have different water requirement. L-DAC needs water
for  its  continuous  operation  while  S-DAC  can  produce  water  by
extracting it from the air. According to Table 2, S-DAC captures water

important  water  consumption  up  to  50  tH2O/tCO2  which  can  be  an
important drawback from an environmental point of view.

Besides S-DAC and L-DAC other processes have been proposed and
are  under  research.  For  instance,  the  use  of  membranes  for  DAC  (M-
DAC) has been recently reviewed [67]. M-DAC has also been proposed
for  the  separation  of  CO2  from  air  due  to  their  smaller  footprint  and
simpler  setup  and  operation.  However,  their  application  remains
elusive. One of the main hurdles of the membranes is that the air has to
be  forced  through  the  membranes,  entailing  higher  operation  costs.
According to Castro-Mu ̃noz et al. [67] the following aspects of M-DAC
must be improved: (1) finding less expensive and available membrane
materials,  (2)  increasing  specific  permeance  and  selectivity,  (3)
Improving lifetime of the membrane systems to compete with the typical
commercially stablished separation operations such as adsorption, ab-
sorption  and  cryogenic  distillation,  and  (4)  process  cost  reduction  to

make the process viable.

The CO2  captured from air can be stored in deep geological forma-
tions such as mineralization underground (carbon capture and storage,
CCS).  This  is  the  preferred  option  because  it  yields  net  negative  CO2
emissions.  Alternatively,  air-captured  CO2  can  be  used  directly  in  in-
dustrial  processes  (i.e.  food  processing)  or  recycled  to  convert  it  into
synthetic fuels and valuable chemicals (carbon capture and utilization,
CCU). The conversion into useful products is an economic incentive to
further develop DAC technologies while in the meantime technologies
for  storage  are  investigated  and  implemented.  The  conversion  into

synthetic  fuels  is  one  of  the  most  promising  due  to  the  large-scale
market.  When  using  synthetic  fuels,  CO2  is  re-emitted  into  the  atmo-
sphere. Thus, the CO2  emissions are not negative, but neutral when it
substitutes  conventional  fossil  fuels,  closing  the  loop  to  a  circular
economy (Fig. 3). Therefore, synthetic fuels should be produced from
DAC or biomass/waste to yield net zero CO2 emissions.

The main companies working with S-DAC and L-DAC are Climeworks
and  Carbon  Engineering,  respectively.  Climeworks  is  a  spin-off  of  the
university  ETH  Zurich  founded  in  Switzerland  in  2009.  Climeworks
launched  its  first  DAC  plant  in  2017  in  Switzerland  and  has  to  date
commissioned 15 plants [11]. Their technology uses amine functional-
ized  solid  adsorbents  which  are  regenerated  at  temperatures  about
C. In September 2021, Climeworks started in Iceland the world’s
100
first  large-scale  plant  (4000  tCO2/year)  named  “Orca”.  This  plant  is
solely  powered  by
(geothermal)  or  an
renewable  energy
energy-from-waste  process  (Fig.  4).  A  life  cycle  assessment  demon-
strated  that  from  every  100  tons  of  CO2  captured  only  10  tons  are
re-emitted,  thus  90  tons  are  permanently  removed.  When  the  CO2  is
permanently stored by mineralization underground [15], the net CO2
emissions are negative contributing to reduce the CO2 concentration in
the atmosphere.

The  CO2  can  be  alternatively  recycled  into  a  useful  raw  material.
There are several projects pursuing the conversion of the captured CO2
by Climeworks plants into useful materials such as fuels, chemicals, and
plastics. To name some of these projects Kopernikus Power-to-X [68] with
the objective to make Germany carbon neutral in 2045, STORE&GO [69]
to integrate Power-to-Gas technology into the future European energy
system,  Celbicon  which  tackles  the  electrochemical  and  biochemical
conversion [70] or Norsk e-Fuel [71] which is a Norwegian project that
produces  neutral  transportation  fuels  using  electrolysis  powered  by
renewable energy. Rotterdam-The Hague Airport uses CO2 captured by
Climeworks technology for the production of renewable jet fuel from air
[72]. The process is carried out in two steps first CO2 is converted into
syngas with electrolyser cells from Sunfire GmbH and later the syngas is
turned  into  synthetic  hydrocarbons  by  means  of  Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis.

Carbon engineering is also a spin-off from the University of Calgary
and Carnegie Mellon University founded in 2009 in Squamish (British
Columbia,  Canada).  It  is  another  company  which  uses  an  alkaline
aqueous solution for DAC [73]. In 2017, this company built the first pilot
plant for the synthesis of clean fuels from DAC (AIR TO FUELSTM) [74].
Carbon  Engineering  in  partnership  with  Occidental  Petroleum  is  devel-
oping a large-scale DAC plant with capture capacity of 1 MtCO2/year.

This plant is planned to be operational by 2024. Besides the synthesis of
fuels  and  chemicals,  CO2  from  DAC  can  be  also  used  for  small-scale
applications in food processing or for feeding algae farms [42].

A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) has shown that both L-
DAC  and  S-DAC  have  the  potential  to  reach  a  net  carbon-removal  of
67–69%  based  on  a  scenario  of  1  Mt/year  CO2  captured  [75].  The
decrease  in  efficiency  is  due  to  the  GHG  emissions  in  DAC  systems
during capture, production of sorbents, leakage from sorbents, land use,
CO2 storage, etc. The operation of DAC facilities has different environ-
mental issues that must be considered when assessing the sustainability
of the process. According to a LCA of S-DAC plants based on the Cli-
meworks technology [76], the carbon footprint of six studied adsorbents
ranged from 10 to 46 g of CO2  per kg of CO2  captured. Some studies
point  that  chemisorbents  like  those  used  by  Climeworks  (supported
amines)  have  lower  environmental  impacts  than  physisorbents.  The
main reason is the lower inventory of material needed due to the higher
capture  capacity  of  chemisorbents  [77].  In  addition,  the  carbon  foot-
print of the construction of a 4 kt CO2/year S-DAC plant was estimated
to be 15 g of CO2 per kg of CO2 captured. The impact of the operation of
the S-DAC was dependent on the electricity grid mixes used. If DAC is
combined with sequestration can result in negative emissions in those
cases with a high percentage of renewable energies in the mix [76]. If
the captured CO2 is used to produce synthetic fuels (such as methane),
the emissions can be almost neutral if renewable energy is used. Chauvi
et al. [78] reviewed the influence of electricity grid mix on the carbon
footprint  for  S-DAC  and  L-DAC  when  the  capture  is  coupled  to  CO2
storage.  They  estimated  that  if  the  electricity  mix  of  US  is  used,  the
carbon  footprint  for  L-DAC  is  around  1.5  kg  of  CO2  per  kg  of  CO2
captured while it is 0.25 kg of CO2  per kg of CO2  captured for S-DAC.
These differences are mainly associated to the temperature used in each
case (low temperature in S-DAC and high temperature in L-DAC). The
carbon footprint for the construction of a L-DAC plant or a S-DAC plant is
in the same range [79]. Regarding the carbon footprint of the absorbent
and  other  used  chemicals,  it  is  very  low  (lower  than  1%)  for  L-DAC.
Therefore, the electricity and the heat are the main contributors to the
carbon footprint for L-DAC.

3. Integration of DAC and conversion to fuels and chemicals

Besides chemical storage in geological formations, a durable sink for
CO2 captured with DAC can be the conversion into materials as concrete
[18], polymers [80], carbon fibres [81], carbon nanotubes [82], etc. To
obtain  these durable  products, the  CO2  capture (either  by  DAC  or  by

post-combustion  capture)  and  conversion  are  usually  separated  pro-
cesses connected through a  gas processing system  [16]. Nevertheless,
most of the works about higher degrees of integration coupling DAC +
conversion  are  focused  on  the  conversion  to  gas  or  liquid  chemical
products such as fuels rather than construction materials. The conver-
sion of captured CO2 into useful products is an incentive to deploy DAC
technology.  CO2  can  be  converted  into  different  chemical  products
(Fig. 5), which can be divided in two main groups: those obtained by a
redox reaction requiring a hydrogenating agent and those obtained by
non-redox  reaction  such  as  urea,  carbamates,  organic  carbonates  and
inorganic carbonates. The products of non-redox reaction are currently
produced  from  fossil  fuels  and  comparatively  the  market  demand  for
these chemicals is much lower than that for fuels and chemicals such as
oxygenates, alkanes and olefins. Fuels for transport can be also produced
starting  from  CO2  via  CO,  methanol,  methane  or  light  olefins  in-
termediates.  The  CO2-based  hydrocarbons  produced  using  renewable
electricity  and  water  are  also  known  as  electro  fuels  (e-fuels)  [83],
whose carbon neutrality is ensured when the used CO2 is captured from
air.  E-fuels  are  becoming  more  important  due  to  the  sustainability
concerns of biofuels and the limited feedstock availability, which com-
promises  its  scalability  [84,85].  Moreover,  the  DAC  process  can  be
optimized  to  capture  not  only  CO2  but  also  the  H2O  needed  for  the
synthesis of e-fuels [86].

Tables 3 and 4 and 5 compiles recent literature studies dealing with
the integration of DAC and CO2 conversion to chemical products. When
using  H2  as  reactant  and  the  suitable  catalyst,  methane  is  favourably
(cid:0)
produced  at  high  temperature  (Table  3),  while  formate  (HCO2
)  and
methanol  are  obtained  at  lower  temperatures  but  at  high  pressures
(Table 4). High temperature is necessary to activate CO2 due to its high
activation  barrier  and  to  drive  the  reaction  to  highly  hydrogenated
products such as methane. On the other hand, high pressure is required
to activate H2  and for shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium to the
product side [87,88]. Besides H2, other co-reactants have been used such
as propane or methanol (see Tables 4 and 5). Some processes involving
ionic liquids (ILs) or metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are carried out at
temperatures  close  to  ambient  temperature  (Table  5).  However,  the
variety of products obtained at mild temperatures are very limited such
cyclic carbonate (non-reduced product) or formic acid (low reduction of
carbon  valence  state),  being  kinetically  not  possible  to  obtain  highly
reduced products.

The CO2 and H2 molecules can be activated by thermal processes or

non-thermal  processes.  In  non-thermal  processes  the  molecules  are
activated vibrationally or electronically by photons (photocatalysis) or
electrons (electrocatalysis) while in thermal processes the molecules are
activated  by  heating  them.  In  the  products  obtained,  carbon  valence
state is more reduced for thermal processes than for non-thermal pro-
cesses. Thus, the main products of non-thermal processes are CO and
formic acid (two-electron reduction) [89], while the thermal activation
can  lead  to  more  reduced  products  such  as  methane  (eight-electron
reduction) or methanol (six-electron reduction) [90]. Accordingly, we
have  classified  the  DAC  + conversion  processes  as  thermal  processes
leading  to  CH4  (power-to-gas,  Table  3),  thermal  processes  to  other
products (power-to-X, Table 4) and non-thermal processes (such elec-
trocatalysis or photocatalysis, Table 5) leading mainly to mildly reduced
products  like  CO  or  formic  acid  or  non-reduced  products  such  as
polycarbonates.

Within  each  type  of  reaction,  different  degrees  of  integration  or
process intensification have been identified to couple DAC and conver-
sion. There  is a strong  technological driver for a higher  level of  inte-
gration  since  the  energy  usage  associated  with  the  regeneration  and
compression steps is reduced, as well as capital savings in equipment.
The following four levels of integration have been identified (Fig. 6):

(i) Processes denoted as D + R in which DAC and reaction are per-
formed independently in different systems, one for DAC and other
for  conversion  starting  from  a  concentrated  and  usually  com-
pressed CO2 transported from an independent DAC process;
(ii)  A further integration level is that denoted as D* + R. Herein, the
capture medium used for DAC (containing the captured CO2) is
transported into other reactor where the conversion occurs. The
DAC medium is simultaneously regenerated and afterwards it is
returned  to  the  DAC  system  to  repeat  the  cycle.  This  level  of
integration avoids the cost of regeneration and pressurization of
CO2.

(iii)  Processes denoted as IDR is meant when both DAC and reaction
are integrated in space because both processes are carried out in
the same vessel. However, there is no integration in time because
the conversion and regeneration occur in subsequent stages by
changing the feed gas or conditions.

(iv)  The highest level of integration are processes denoted as SDR, in
which  DAC  and  reaction  are  performed  simultaneously  or  in

Fig. 5. Main products that can be obtained from the captured CO2.

3.1. Integration of DAC with thermo-catalytic power-to-gas

The power-to-gas (PtG) scheme combines the CO2 utilization and the
chemical storage of green H2  for the synthesis of fuel gases (normally
CH4) [91,92]. Table 3 compiles cases where DAC is combined with PtG
using different levels of integration, which are explained below.

3.1.1.

Independent capture and conversion (D + R)

DAC and PtG are processes that have been developed independently
[32,93,94]. It has been reported [95] that the integration of both pro-
cesses  is  difficult  due  to  the  complex  structure  of  interactions  and

synergies.  Accordingly,  using  the  available  technologies  for  DAC  and
PtG as separate units is the easiest approach and thus the first one that
has been studied at various scales. DAC can be performed by sorbents
(solid  and  liquid)  as  described  above  and  subsequently  CO2  can  be
concentrated,  compressed,  stored  and  transported.  In  a  second  step,
several technologies convert CO2 with H2, directly or via synthesis gas to
fuels such as methane, methanol, Fischer–Tropsch products, polymers or
speciality chemicals [24]. In addition, the use of green H2, i.e., produced
from  water  electrolysis  powered  by  renewable  electricity,  makes  the
process outstand among the more feasible solutions for seasonal storage
of renewable energy. There are several projects worldwide in which the
DAC  has  been  coupled  to  PtG  in  separate  reactors.  For  instance,  the
SOLETAIR  project [92,96] uses a  DAC technology by  Hydrocell. Sub-
sequently, decentralized mobile pilot plants produces gasoline, diesel,
and kerosene via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a power-to-X approach.

Fig. 6. Possible configurations for coupling DAC and chemical CO2 conversion. The D + R stands for DAC plus reaction of concentrated CO2 (i), D*+R stands for DAC
without a separate regeneration step because the regeneration is carried out simultaneously with the subsequent conversion (ii); IDR stands for integrated DAC and
reaction in space but not in time (iii); and SDR for simultaneous DAC and reaction, in which the integration is in space and time (iv). Dashed lines mean operational
modes, switching from DAC to conversion and vice versa.

Some of these D + R approaches tackled the heat integration of both
reactors to make the whole process autothermic [97].

In  the  pioneering  studies,  both  DAC  and  methanation  have  been
performed  using  different  solid  materials  held  in  different  vessels.
Veselovskaya  et  al.  [99]  (Fig.  7)  performed  the  DAC  and  subsequent
methanation using two fixed beds connected in series and using tem-
perature swings [98–100]. The CO2 is adsorbed from air in the first bed
at room temperature using K2CO3  on alumina. The sorbent is regener-
◦
ated by increasing the temperature up to 200–300
C while flowing H2,
CO2 is released. Then it passes to the second vessel (conversion reactor)

containing a commercial Ni catalyst [99] or Ru/Al2O3  [98,100] where
CH4  is  produced.  In  another  D  + R  approach,  DAC  is  performed  by
carbonation of MgSiO3  to MgCO3  and subsequently the solid is mixed
with a Ni catalyst to produce methane of very high purity [101]. The
capture and reaction are carried out in two separate vessels. The CO2
capture step takes very long time (about six months) and the solid is
transported from one vessel to the other. Processes with higher degree of
integration, shorter capture times and without the need of transporting
solids would be desired.

3.1.2. Using a single vessel and two steps (IDR)

◦

The  methanation  reaction  is  usually  performed  at  intermediate
temperatures (300–500
C) and there are adsorbents that adsorb CO2
within the same temperature range or lower temperatures. For instance,
alkali and alkaline earth metals form carbonates in the same tempera-
ture  range as  the  methanation occurs  (200–400
C). Accordingly, the

◦

CO2  adsorption  and  methanation  can  be  performed  at  the  same  tem-
perature avoiding temperature swings. The coupling of DAC and con-
version  in  a  single  vessel  will  avoid  the  CO2  transport  from  the  DAC
system to the reactor system. Moreover, the proximity between capture
and  catalytic  functions  creates  synergetic  effects  (discussed  later),
facilitating the regeneration of the capture material and favouring heat

and  mass  transfer,  thus  contributing  to  process  intensification  [107].
The two different functional materials can be placed in the same vessel
and swapping between the two feed gases; first CO2-containing air and
subsequently H2 to release CO2 from the sorbent and convert it into CH4
at the catalytic sites as schematically depicted in Fig. 8.

C and the reaction at 300–350

There  are  several  variants  for  this  approach.  One  alternative  is  to
place  both  the  adsorbent  and  the  catalyst,  separated  but  in  the  same
reactor (i.e., a physical solid mixture), and switching between the two
feeds,  i.e.  air and  H2. This  approach was  used  by Veselovskaya  et  al.
[105]  who  placed  K2CO3  as  adsorbent  and  Ru/Al2O3  as  methanation
catalyst in two consecutive beds in a single reactor. The adsorption took
C. The other more recent
place at 25
approach is using a single material encompassing both functionalities in
intimate  (nanometre  scale)  contact.  The  very  short  diffusional  length
leads to significant process intensification by enhancing heat and mass
transfer  allowing  operating  at  isothermal  conditions,  thus  avoiding
temperature  swings  [22].  The  materials  containing  the  two  functions
(CO2  capture and catalyst) are called dual functional materials (DFM).
They  are  comprised  of  interspersed  alkaline  adsorbent  and  catalytic
transition  metal  supported  on  the  same  carrier,  usually  Al2O3.  DFM
materials were originally developed for the capture and conversion of
CO2 from flue gases [22,108–110]. Recently, their application has been
extended to DAC. One significant difference between DAC and capture
from flue gases is that the air contains 21% O2 that oxidises the transi-
tion metal (Ni or Ru) during the capture step at medium temperatures.
Subsequently,  the  metal  should  be  reduced  before  being  active  for
methanation. In the reduction step, Ru oxides re-reduces readily being
stable in cyclic performance in the presence of O2  and moisture [111]
while NiO is not completely reduced loosing performance [112]. Thus,
Ru  is  preferred  over  Ni  for  DFMs  capturing  CO2  from  air  due  to  its
favourable  redox  properties.  Since  Ru  is  significantly  more  expensive
than Ni, research efforts have been devoted to enhance the reducibility
of Ni, for instance by alloying with small amounts of Ru [113].

The literature dealing with the use of DFM for DAC is very scarce.
Farrauto et al., who have thoroughly studied the application of DFM to
flue gases, have just recently reported a feasibility study about the use of
DFM for the integration of DAC with methanation [103]. A DFM con-
◦
sisting of Na and Ru demonstrated stable cyclic performance at 320
C in
DAC. The authors performed also the regeneration of the sorbent under
inert gas and the regeneration was not as complete as under H2. This was
explained  because  CO2  methanation  is  exothermic  leading  to  local
temperature increase favouring the CO2 desorption and reaction, hence
leading  to  more  complete  regeneration.  This  emphasises  the  process
intensification  achieved  by  reactive  regeneration  with  H2.  Simulta-
neously to the regeneration, a valuable product, CH4, is produced. The
effect of moisture present in air was also studied, finding a reversible
decrease of CO2  capture without affecting the catalytic activity in suc-
cessive cycles. These preliminary results are very promising, revealing
that further research is needed in the future to demonstrate the technical
and economic viability of the process at larger scales. The authors point
into future research directions such as lowering the operation temper-
ature to reduce the energy requirements and increase CO2 capture and
process optimization and DFM materials design to increase the heat and
mass transfer, thus increasing CH4  productivity. Therefore, developing
DFMs working at lower temperatures is a challenging opportunity ahead
for catalysis researchers. The DFM should consist of more active syner-
gistic methanation catalyst and sorbents materials which are completely
regenerated at lower temperatures.

In a recent study, a very low-concentration of CO2  (100 ppm CO2)
was successfully converted into 11.5% CH4, using a DFM Ni/Na-γ-Al2O3
[104]. The CH4 productivity increased when the pressure was increased
from 0.1 to 0.9 MPa. These studies are preliminary and further research
using  ambient  air  with  humidity  is  needed.  During  air  capture,  the
heating of large volume of air is unfeasible. Therefore, it seems more
convenient to perform the capture step at room temperature and later
heat to regenerate. Ni/Na-γ-Al2O3 was also evaluated in non-isothermal

CH4 production (ca. 1 mmol/g), which is much higher than when both
◦
processes were operated at 320
C (0.145 mmol/g) [103]. In contrast to
isothermal operation, after adsorption at 25
C the catalyst  has to be
◦
heated up to 320
C leading to a transient operation. It remains unclear
how the transient periods will affect the quality of the product. More-
over, methods to heat the material very fast, like technology based on
inductive  heating,  seems  to  be  useful  to  operate  faster,  shortening
transient periods [114]. This can eventually be the solution to enhance
the  efficiency  of  the  process.  Moreover,  induction  heating  affords
localized and precise temperature control and it will contribute to sus-
tainability by the electrification of the process.

3.1.3. Using a fully-integrated single process (SDR)

In  some  processes,  DAC  and  conversion/regeneration  are  carried
either simultaneously or in cascade, enabling continuous operation. The
process should be designed for conditions that favour thermodynami-
cally  a  DAC  followed  by  conversion  pathways.  In  the  context  of  CO2
separation from space cabins, a reactive separation process with mem-
branes is proposed in which separation and methanation reaction are
coupled producing 12 μmol/h/g of CH4 [106]. This process was studied
by  simulation  and  used  high  temperature  membranes  which  are
continuously regenerated  by the Sabatier  reaction (i.e., CO2  hydroge-
nation to CH4) using a Ni-based catalyst, thus achieving synergies for
both  processes.  Compared  to  the  conventional  process  (Fig.  9a),  the
membrane  process  avoids  the  compression  step  (Fig.  9b).  The  CO2
capture and conversion processes in one single pass are very scarce in
the  literature,  especially  those  carried  out  at  high  temperatures.  SDR
processes are commonly non-thermal processes such as the capture and
conversion  into  carbonates  [115]  or  polycarbonates  [116].  These
non-thermal processes are explained more in detail in section 3.3.

3.2. DAC coupled to CO2  thermal conversion to methanol, formate/
formic acid and other products (power-to-X)

Examples  of  the  combination  of  DAC  with  thermal  conversion  to
products different from CH4 such as methanol, formate (conjugate base
of formic acid in basic media) and propylene are compiled in Table 4.
Methanol and formate are liquids and use mainly L-DAC and homoge-
neous catalysts, in contrast, the production of CH4 (Table 3) uses mainly
S-DAC and heterogeneous catalysts. The yields of methanol or formate
(Table 4), which are carried out in homogenous phase, are also larger
than those to CH4  (Table 3). This can be attributed  to the higher ab-
sorption capacity of the liquid bases, higher mass transfer rate in ho-
mogeneous phase and the use of very active homogeneous catalysts. In
contrast,  the  homogeneous  phases  operation  entails  higher  costs  for
separation of products and catalysts.

Kar et al. performed the integration of DAC and conversion to either
methanol or formate [117]. Therein, the compounds after CO2 capture
(using amines or hydroxides) are directly fed to the downstream con-
version process to synthetize methanol or formate salts (Fig. 10). The
products  (methanol  and  formate)  are  very  attractive  for  many  useful
applications such as fuels, fuel additives, reversible H2  storage media,
energy  carriers,  etc.  The  processes  developed  by  this  group  can  be
divided into amine- and hydroxide-assisted capture. The group first re-
ported  the  tandem  capture  of  CO2  from  air  with  polyamine  and  its
subsequent conversion into formic acid (Fig. 10a) or methanol (Fig. 10b)
using an homogenous catalyst (named Ru-Macho-BH) at 145
C [118],
achieving  a  yield  to  methanol  of  75%.  The  direct  conversion  of  CO2
captured in the polyamine can be carried out in the same vessel as the
capture, hence it can be classified as IDR type integration. In a follow-up
paper  [119],  they  used  a  biphasic  2-MTHF/water  system,  which  also
facilitates  the  separation  and  recycling  of  the  amine  (in  the  aqueous

cles. According to the scheme (Fig. 11), the CO2 capture is performed in
a  vessel  before  the  CO2-loaded  amine  is  transferred  to  other  vessel,
where it is mixed with the organic phase containing the catalyst for the

conversion. Thus, the level of integration could be classified as D*+R.
Using also the biphasic system to separate the absorbent and the cata-
lyst, these authors used aqueous inorganic hydroxide (NaOH/KOH) so-
lutions  for  CO2  capture  and  its  conversion  into  formate  salts  using

homogeneous pincer catalysts in the organic phase (Fig. 10c) [53] in the
same  reactor  (IDR  integration).  The  formate  can  be  hydrolysed  to
regenerate the NaOH and produce formic acid or the formate salts can be
directly utilized, without any purification, in a direct formate fuel cell
(DFFC) to produce electricity and regenerate the hydroxide base, which
is recycled. In another work [120], the synthesis of methanol was per-
formed from alkali carbonates and bicarbonates formed by CO2 captured
from air in a solution of ethylene glycol. In a second step, the hydroxide
◦
was regenerated at temperatures as low as 100
C while converting CO2
into  methanol  using  a  homogeneous  pincer  catalyst.  Subsequently,
methanol  is  separated  by  distillation.  According  to  the  authors,  this
process can be carried in one pot (IDR integration) and it has the po-
tential to be implemented in continuous mode. The authors claim that
the  process  is  more  efficient  than  an  amine-based  process  due  to  the
higher  capture  efficiency  and  higher  stability  of  the  alkali.  The  same
group performed the integration of DAC using also an ethylene glycol
solution  and  hydrogenation  of  CO2  to  methanol  using  a  commercial
heterogeneous Cu/ZnO/Al2O3  catalyst at a relatively low temperature
range (170–200
C) using H2 [121]. Ethylene glycol enhanced the CO2
conversion values up to 120% compared to the solvent-less system. The
methanol yields rose up to 90%, which is close to the calculated equi-
librium limit. The catalyst was recycled and the process carried out in
one single vessel (IDR integration) in batch operation. Both capture and
conversion took long time (about 72 h each one) but the authors claim
that  it  has  the  potential  to  be  carried  out  in  continuous.  Another  re-
ported  approach  is  the  one-reactor  two-step  process  for  the  hydroge-
nation of amine-captured CO2  into methanol, formate, and formamide
using silica-supported Au nanoparticles as catalyst in the presence of a
Lewis acid such as boric acid [122]. This process converts CO2 from air
at  ambient  pressures  to  C1  products  avoiding  the  use  of  an  organic
solvent.

In the processes discussed previously, H2 is used as co-reactant with
the captured CO2. Other reactants different from H2 have also been used,
although more scarcely. CO2  captured from air has been also coupled
with other thermal reaction such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane at 600
C [123]. In that work, a dual functional material con-
sisting of CaO as adsorbent and M@ZSM-5 (M = V-, Ga-, Ti-, or Ni-oxide)
as heterogeneous catalyst was prepared with a multichannel monolithic
macrostructure using a novel direct metal-oxide 3D printing technique.
The  monolithic  material  was  used  for  performing  both  capture  and
conversion (IDR integration). The best CO2 capture and propylene yield
◦
was attained when both steps are performed isothermally at 600
C, thus
fully eliminating the thermal gradient which normally occurs when a
different optimized temperature is used in each process.

In general, the processes denoted as IDR use the same reactor for the

capture and reaction, therefore they have the potential to be carried out
in quasi-continuous fashion using two vessels (swing operation), in one
reactor the capture is carried out while in the other the conversion is
performed and subsequently the vessels are swapped. However, the re-
action times tend to be very long, for instance 72 h for 100% conversion
of captured CO2 [120], and the products are very diluted, leading to low
productivities and high separation costs.

3.3. CO2  capture and conversion by non-thermal processes

Table 5 compiles the literature dealing with the combination of DAC
and  the  CO2  conversion  by  non-thermal  processes.  There  are  some
products that can be attained at room temperature using the suitable
reducing reagent. There are several examples of chemical reduction of
captured  CO2  at  room  temperature  using  ionic  liquids  (ILs)  or  metal
organic frameworks (MOFs). The DAC and conversion into formate were
performed in tandem at atmospheric conditions (room temperature and
1 bar) using pyrrolidinium-based IL with a borohydride anion. The IL
captures up to 1 g CO2 per 1 g IL (20 mmol CO2/g IL), which is subse-
quently reduced to formate by borohydride [125]. The product can be
then  treated  with  HCl  to  give  formic  acid  and  the  corresponding  IL
chloride, which can be recycled after treating with sodium borohydride.
In  a  subsequent  paper,  the  authors  used  another  IL  (of  tetraalky-
lammonium family) combined with borohydride for solid–gas reduction
of CO2 [126]. The captured CO2 is converted in a next step by reacting
with  HCl  or  an  amine  to  valuable  products  such  as  formic  acid  or
N-formylated amine, respectively. These processes can be classified as
IDR  since  they can be  performed  in  one  pot by  adding the  reactants.
However, the processes have some drawbacks such as the requirement
of distillation to separate the IL and the consumption of sodium boro-
hydride to regenerate the IL. Moreover, the time for CO2  capture from
air took as long as 16 days, which is one of the inherent disadvantages of
capturing CO2 from air versus a concentrated source such flue gas.

In  other  non-thermal  processes,  the  DAC  and  conversion  are  per-
formed  simultaneously  (SDR).  A bifunctional  Mg(II)-based  MOF,  con-
taining a nitrogen-rich tripodal linker and a Lewis acid metal ion Mg(II),
exhibited highly efficient fixation of CO2 from air into value-added cy-
clic carbonates [116]. This process was carried out at mild temperature
and in the absence of co-catalyst and solvent. In other process [127],
sodium glycinate is used for DAC by formation of bicarbonate ions that
accelerate the mineralization to calcium carbonate with CaO and CaSiO3
◦
as the precursors, achieving a degree of mineralization of 97% at 90
C.
This capture material is continuously and spontaneously regenerated in
aqueous phase. In another reaction [128], CO2 was captured from air on
powder  Ce0.8Zr0.2O2  solid  solution  and  subsequently  converted  into

sorbent. The reaction occurs under mild conditions (1 bar; 70(cid:0) 110

Photocatalysis  [134]  and  electrocatalysis  [135]  outstand  among
non-thermal processes. Combinations of these core technologies are also
being used, such as photothermal [136], electrothermal [137] or pho-
toelectrochemical  [138].  Each  technology  has  their  own  benefits  and
limitations,  not  being  excluding  technologies  but  complementary.
Comparing with thermocatalysis, the source of energy to drive the re-
action is different: thermal energy for thermocatalysis or electrons from
renewable  electricity for electrocatalysis, or  photogenerated electrons
for photocatalysis. Thermocatalysis provides sufficient energy to surpass
the CO2 activation barrier, entailing higher reaction rates and yields but
unfortunately
the
heating-associated  CO2  emission  of  thermal  processes,  the  reaction
should be heated using renewable electricity, an area that is emerging
these days with novel electrically-heated reactor designs [139,140] or
induction  heating  [114,141,142]  reactors.  In  contrast,  photocatalysis
and  electrocatalysis  are  less  energy  intensive  because  do  not  require
heating.  Nevertheless,  the  kinetics  are  slower  and  the  products  are
diluted in a liquid solvent with the concomitant separation costs. On the
other  hand,  CO2  is  more  difficult  to  reduce  chemically  at  room  tem-
perature,  leading  to  less  reduced  products  than  those  obtained  by
thermocatalysis. The higher yields and lower separation costs of ther-
mocatalysis makes this technology more suitable for scaling up and thus
for the immediate adoption in industry, where emitted CO2 can be easily
captured and H2  is readily available. However, for small scale distrib-
uted  units  integrated  with  DAC,  the  higher  yield  of  thermocatalytic
processes is not so crucial. Because the recent interest in DAC, there are
only a few examples of the integration of DAC with electrocatalytic or
photocatalytic reduction which are revised below.

The firstly implemented approaches for DAC and electrolysis used
separated  reactors  (D*+R  integration  level).  In  1995,  one  of  the  pio-
neering works of the integration of DAC and conversion was reported
[129]. In this process, CO2 is transported from air through a hollow fibre
membrane containing a solution of KOH, which absorbs CO2 in the form
of K2CO3. This solution is transported to an electrolyser where CO2  is
desorbed by electrolysis of K2CO3 and both CO2 and H2O are reduced to
synthesis gas (CO/H2 mixture). Synthesis gas can be subsequently con-
verted to methanol in a third reactor. If we consider synthesis gas as the
product,  the  integration is  of  the  type D*  + R  because the  sorbent is

regenerated during the conversion in the electrolytic cell. However, if
methanol is considered as the final product, the integration would be of
type D + R because a third reactor is needed. This latter is a three-step
process to methanol with a low degree of integration. In the conclusions,
the authors note that the economics of the process have not been studied
in detail, thus further feasibility studies would be necessary.

Some recent studies revise the last research efforts in the integration
of  CO2  capture  (not  only  DAC)  and  electrochemical  conversion  [143,
144]. These reviews  emphasize that, while both the CO2  capture and
electrochemical  CO2  reduction  have  been  intensively  investigated  as
separated  processes,  only  a  few  studies  addressed  integration  of  both
processes. A highly promising approach is utilizing the capture solution
as an electrolyte for the electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R). How-
ever, at this moment this technology is limited by low partial current
densities and Faradaic efficiencies (FE) that can be achieved with these
solutions. Therefore, further research is needed. One recent perspective
article  appeared  dealing  with  the  coupling  of  electrochemical  CO2
conversion  with  CO2  capture,  addressing  also  CO2  captured  from  air
[145]. This perspective considers conceptually three levels of coupling
similar to the levels that we have denoted as D + R, IDR and SDR. The
article points that the two later levels have unique advantages including
lower  capital  and  operational  expenditure,  but  more  research  is  still
needed on the catalytic materials. For electrochemical reduction, the use
of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and MOFs are proposed to in-
crease CO2 concentration, thus alleviating the limitations posed by low
CO2 concentrations in air by increasing its concentration [146]. Another
system used a solution of hydroxides to capture CO2  via formation of
bicarbonates  (Fig.  12).  The  bicarbonate-enriched  solution  is  electro-
catalytically reduced to CO and concomitantly the hydroxide is regen-
erated  with  a  suitable  electrode  such  as  free-standing  porous  silver
[130]. This system connects upstream carbon capture to electrochemical
CO2  utilization  without  high  temperature  or  pressurization  steps
(Fig. 12, orange pathway). The authors suggested that the CO produced
at  high  FE  can  be  further  converted  into  C2+ by  Fischer-Tropsch.
Nevertheless, this work uses 3 M bicarbonate and achieving this high
concentration from the high dilution in air is not so straightforward. This
work does not mention how to achieve this bicarbonate concentration
from air. In another article [131], it is reported that a concentration of
0.658 M is achieved after 8.5 h of capture from air and the FE decreases
significantly  as  the  concentration  decreases  (Fig.  13).  The  two  later
examples [130,131] have an integration level denoted as D* + R for CO
production. This level involves two vessels (the DAC and the conversion

and an exclusively electrolytic process that uses as electrolyte the bicarbonate solution after CO2  capture (D*+R, orange). The orange pathway does not require a
thermal step for CO2  recovery, and does not require a pure stream of gaseous CO2  to be fed into the electrolyser. Reprinted from Ref. [130] with permission RSC.

vessels) and the solution containing captured CO2  is transported from
one reactor to the other. Therefore, this type of integration is applicable
for a L-DAC and for non-thermal conversion (such as electrocatalyst),
where both processes occur at room temperature and it is not necessary
to heat the fluid. As explained above, the integration level D*+R avoids
a separate step of regeneration since regeneration is carried out during
conversion.  After  this,  the  regenerated  material  is  recirculated  to  the
DAC  system.  When  a  third  reactor  for  Fischer-Tropsch  is  added  the
integration becomes of type D + R and includes a thermal process.

Other type of non-thermal process coupled to DAC is photocatalysis.
The stage of development is very incipient and there is not much liter-
ature  about  coupling  DAC  and  CO2  conversion  using  photocatalysis
[133].  Layered  double  hydroxides  (LDHs)  are  used  to  capture  CO2,
which is subsequently reduced photo-catalytically to CO in the photo-
cathode, at the same time that selective oxidation of 5-HMF is carried
out in the photoanode (Fig. 14). Both processes are carried out sponta-
neously  in  cascade  (SDR  integration).  Elsewhere,  the  simultaneous
capture and photocatalytic conversion (SDR) is also carried out using
Janus  membranes  consisting  of  polyimide  and  Cu-doped  TiO2  [132].
The polyimide layer concentrates CO2 while it is simultaneously reduced
photo-catalytically  to  CO  in  the  TiO2  layer.  Looking  at  the  yields  of
photocatalytic  processes  in  Table  5,  they  are  in  the  range  of  a  few
μmol/g, while the other thermal processes (Tables 3 and 4) are in the

range of hundreds to thousands of μmol/g. Therefore, the yields of re-
ported photocatalytic processes are still low to compete with thermal
processes.  Nevertheless,  for  a  holistic  evaluation,  other  parameters
should  be  considered  such  as  the  zero-energy  consumption  and  GHG
emissions.

4. Discussion about technoeconomic issues

Technoeconomic  (TEA)  and  life  cycle  assessment  (LCA)  studies  of
DAC have been performed in the literature [66,147,148]. The discussion
in this section does not intend to be comprehensive but only give some
clues about aspects to improve the integration of DAC and conversion
systems. Since this technology is evolving at a fast pace, life cycle studies
should  be  performed  on  a  technology-by-technology  basis  and  also
considering the effect on all sustainable development goals [149]. Ac-
cording to the revised articles, the main economic impacts of DAC are in
the energy required for operation but there are also other environmental
impacts related to the use of land, water, and materials. For example, in
section 2.2, it is mentioned that the operation of L-DAC requires large
quantities of water. In addition, for each capture material, the emissions
generated  during  its  production,  operation  or  at  the  end  of  life  by
decomposition  must  be  also  considered.  The  production  of  some  ad-
sorbents can have environmental implications. For instance, some kinds

c D + R integration requires more energy for regeneration than D*+R or IDR. In the latter ones the regeneration is performed simultaneously to conversion. The absorption with alkali hydroxide solution (typical for

power-to-X) requires less energy than adsorption in a solid (typical of power-to-gas).

d Alkaline oxides and hydroxides are significantly less expensive than membranes and ionic liquids and other more elaborated sorbents proposed for non-thermal processes.
e The homogeneous catalyst used in power-to-X are more expensive to prepare than the heterogenous catalyst base on transition metals (as e.g Ni, Fe, Ti) used in power-to-gas and non-thermal processes.
f The reactions in liquid phase, using homogenous catalyst and with lower selectivities have higher separation cost that reactions in gas phase.
g Larger hydrocarbons or oxygenates (methanol) have higher value than CH4. CO has lower value because it has to undergo subsequent transformation via Fischer–Tropsch process or methanol synthesis.
h Less reduced products such CO have lower market cost than more reduced products. The cost is also higher for oxygenates and hydrocarbons with larger number of carbon atoms.

factors such as personnel costs have not been considered in the quali-
tative comparison of Table 6 because, they are estimated to be similar
for  all  integration  levels.  However,  they  should  be  considered  when
performing a detailed TEA.

It  is  clear  that  coupling  DAC  with  CO2  conversion  contributes  to
circular economy. CO2 from air can be converted to different chemicals,
polymers or fuels. LCA from cradle-to-grave of the environmental, eco-
nomic or even social impact of each product must be performed on an
project-by-project basis to prove the feasibility and sustainability of each
particular process and disclose the benefits of integration [157]. For a
circular  carbon  neutral  process,  first  CO2  conversion  must  rely  on
renewable reducing reactants such as green H2. The cradle-to-grave LCA
studies should also consider the GHG emissions during the whole pro-
cess of capture and conversion [158]. Some processes are carried out at
high temperatures and therefore it is necessary to supply heat. Heating
in  the  multiple  energy  sectors  is  identified  as  the  most  significant
contributor  to  GHG  emissions,  accounting  for  60%  of  the  total  GHG
emissions  [158].  For  the  circularity  of  the  process,  electrification  of
heating and using low-carbon electricity can further reduce GHG emis-
sions  by 47%, but such conditions will significantly sacrifice the eco-
nomic  benefit.  Electrifying  heating  can  also  be  performed  using  new
heating  technologies  such as  novel electrically-heated  reactor  designs
[139,140]  or  induction  heating  [114,141,142].  The  developments  in
efficient heating technologies based on renewable energy will pave the
way to a really circular economy.

Alternative  to  thermal  conversion,  performing  the  conversion  at
room temperature is beneficial from the economic and GHG emissions
standpoints. Currently, the chemical conversion at room temperature is
limited in terms of yield and type of compounds that can be obtained, as,
e.g.,  organic  cyclic  carbonates,  inorganic  carbonates  or  CO.  In  this
respect,  the  activation  of  CO2  and  reactants  by  technologies  such  as
electrocatalysis, photocatalysis or non-thermal plasma, which are car-
ried out at room temperature and driven by renewable energy, exhibit
very  good  prospects.  However,  for  its  practical  deployment,  further
research is needed about electro/photo-catalysts and their integration
with DAC technologies. To the best our knowledge, non-thermal plasma
has been used for CO2 conversion [159] but it has not been really tested
under conditions of DAC.

5. Conclusions and outlook

The coupling of CO2 capture from air (DAC) and conversion has been
recognized  as  a  potential  way  to  negative  or  zero  carbon  emissions,
when CO2 is stored permanently or converted to fuels, respectively, and
as long as the processes of storage or conversion to fuels are run with
renewable  energy.  Compared  to  point  CO2  capture  from  stationary
sources, DAC has some advantages such as the delocalisation, potential
negative emissions and no stringent efficiency requirements. DAC is a
plausible solution to reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in the
shorter-term. In the longer term, it is expected to close the carbon cycle,
whereby the CO2 in the atmosphere is converted to fuels, ideally leading
to net zero carbon emissions in a circular economy approach. However,
DAC poses the challenge of the high dilution of CO2, which entails longer
times of capture and larger gas volumes to treat. The traditional pro-
cesses  for  DAC  are  based  on  alkaline  solutions  (L-DAC)  or  solid-
supported amines (S-DAC), although recently other technologies such
as membranes (M-DAC) are under investigation. An increasing research
effort is being devoted to the integration of DAC with CO2  conversion,
leading to creative strategies which are starting to be scaled up. The first
strategy  explored  for  coupling  DAC  with  CO2  conversion  is  based  on
performing  CO2  capture  and  reaction  in  different  vessels  (D  + R).  A
higher level of integration (D*+R) is using two different vessels but the
material saturated with CO2 is transported from one vessel to the other
one, where the capture material is regenerated and simultaneously the
CO2  is converted into different products. A further advance in process
intensification  can  be  achieved  if  both  DAC  and  CO2  conversion  are

integrated in the same reactor. When the combined process is carried out
in only one vessel, the DAC and conversion can occur either in consec-
utive stages with change of feed (IDR) or simultaneously in a cascade
reaction (SDR). Process intensification afforded by a higher integration
level  can  lead  to  significant  energy  and  equipment  cost  savings  and
other synergistic effects, entailing higher efficiency.

However,  this  coupling  entails  several  challenges  to  be  solved
because  both  processes  meet  optimal  performance  at  very  different
conditions.  Therefore,  significant  research  efforts  and  technological
developments are needed for the integration of DAC and CO2  conver-
sion. It is plenty of research opportunities for material development to
integrate  the  capture  function  with  catalytic/electrocatalytic/photo-
catalytic function. CO2  DAC + conversion offers the versatility to pro-
duce  very  different  products  that  can  range  from  materials  (as,  e.g.,
cyclic carbonates or inorganic carbonates) to various hydrocarbon fuels.
The reduction of CO2  to fuels requires a chemical reducing agent that
must be renewable to make the whole process carbon neutral, such as
green H2. Electrons can also work as reducing agents that are active for
the  reduction  of  both  CO2  and  H2O  into  CO  or  formic  acid  at  room
temperature. Moreover, electrons can be renewable since they can be
generated  either  by  renewable  electricity  or  by  photons.  For  non-
thermal  processes,  there  is  a  large  opportunity  for  research  on  more
electro/photoactive materials and on the integration of DAC with non-
thermal plasma, electrocatalysis or photocatalysis. On the other hand,
the reduction with H2 to fuels such as CH4 requires high temperatures.
Therefore, for a carbon-neutral process, the supply of heat must be also
based  on  renewable  electricity.  In  this  regard,  the  electrification  of
heating plays an important role as well. Electrically heated reactors or
magnetic induction are technologies that deserves further research.

The diversity of products, yields, type of capture material, process
conditions  etc.  makes  difficult  a  general  comparison  between  the
different  integration  levels.  A  higher  degree  of  integration  does  not
mean necessarily lower costs. For instance, some non-thermal processes
have higher degree of integration than some thermal processes but the
formers have additional costs for distillation of products and separation
of homogeneous catalyst, besides of the lower achieved yield. Therefore,
detailed  technoeconomic  studies  of  the  different  integration  levels
should be performed on a project-by-project basis. These studies should
consider  not  only  economic  factors  (higher  yields  and  energy  con-
sumption)  but  also  carbon  balances,  use  of  resources,  benefits  of
decentralized production and, in general, all the impacts on sustainable
development goals (SDGs). A world based on circular economy needs
further  developments  in  the  coupling  of  DAC  and  conversion,  whose
deployment is expected to be propelled in the near future by cheaper
renewable  energy,  green  H2  production  and  increasing  taxes  to  CO2
emission.
