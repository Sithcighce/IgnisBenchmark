To mitigate the various socioeconomic/environmental consequences associated with plastic waste, it is crucial to
adopt strategic measures aimed at source reduction. In this regard, the thermo-chemical approach is a promising
technical option to realize this objective within the framework of the circular economy. Such approach involves
transforming plastic waste into chemicals/fuels, which contributes to the build-up of a more sustainable and
resource-efficient platform. Precise control over yield and selectivity towards target chemicals (monomers, light
olefins, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers (BTEXs)) and fuels (transportation fuels and
syngas) is achievable by manipulating operating parameters for the thermo-chemical platform despite the
possibly marked influence of the waste composition on product distribution. This review aims to delineate a
technically viable pathway of the thermo-chemical approach with the discussion on the physico-chemical
properties and compositional characteristics of plastics, technical alternatives for their recycling, and the asso-
ciated environmental risks (improper disposal practices including mismanagement, landfilling, and incinera-
tion). This review helps open a new path for the development of a strategic technical approach within thermo-
chemical processing to integrate different facets of plastic waste recycling. Thus, it will contribute to the reali-
zation of a closed-loop circular economy within the plastic value chain by focusing on thermo-chemical recycling
of plastic waste.

1. Introduction

Plastics have emerged as an indispensable alternative to conven-
tional materials such as wood, metal, ceramic, and paper owing to their
superior and versatile physico-chemical properties encompassing
affordability, durability, lightness, plasticity, and non-corrosivity [1].
Their widespread utilization is evident across diverse industrial domains
and applications, including packaging, construction, transportation, and
electronics [2,3]. The cumulative production of plastics over the

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101219

preceding 70 years (since their commercialization) has reached 9.5 Ã
109 tons [4], with over 50 % by weight generated in the last two decades
[5]. A short lifespan of plastics has led to a proliferation of plastic waste,
nearly mirroring the trajectory of global plastic production [6]. The
non-biodegradable nature of plastics has engendered profound envi-
ronmental challenges, notably in the form of microplastics (MPs) [7,8].
MPs have gained recognition as emerging contaminants due to their
hazardous potentials and unprecedented environmental fates [9â13].
The migration and accumulation of (in)organic pollutants onto MPs are
influenced by their hydrophobicity, serving a vital role as vectors of
pollutants [14]. They are susceptible to uncontrolled uptake by specific
living organisms owing to their buoyancy in water [15]. Once incor-
porated into intricate food webs, MPs can exert lethal impacts on human
beings [16]. Nevertheless, a reliable technical disposal platform for MPs
has not been established, primarily owing to a low technical readiness
level to identify/quantify MPs [17,18]. Consequently, a proactive
measure should be developed to efficiently reduce the source of plastic
waste while mitigating the potential hazards posed by MPs [19].

Landfilling has been a prevalent method for disposing plastic wastes,
with over 60 % by total mass deposited in landfill sites [5]. Proper
landfill design and operation provide an opportunity to obstruct the
inadvertent release of plastic wastes and associated environmental im-
pacts for an extended duration [20]. However, the enduring presence of
plastics in landfill sites poses a potential risk of releasing MPs and toxic
chemicals into various environmental media, including soil and water
[21]. Alternatively, incineration has been primarily practiced wherein
plastic wastes undergo complete and rapid oxidative decomposition
[22]. Also, the recovery of heat energy becomes a desirable outcome of
incinerating plastic wastes, given the comparable heating value of
plastics to those of diesel and kerosene [23]. Nevertheless, incineration
may not be a viable option from an environmental standpoint. Plastic
waste incineration significantly contributes to the carbon footprint by
releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) [24]. Moreover, complete oxidation of
plastics is yet challenging owing to technical difficulties in optimizing
the equivalence ratio (ER) [25]. This approach instead causes undesir-
able formations of hazardous air pollutants [26]. Consequently, there is
an urgent need to explore effective and futuristic disposal platforms for
plastic wastes that can meet goals for environmental sustainability and
economic feasibility [27].

To date, a plethora of technical approaches have been developed and
employed for the valorization of plastic wastes [28]. The recovery of

monomers, which are the repetitive units constituting plastics,
considered one of the promising valorization routes [29]. This process
entails transforming plastic wastes into monomers, typically using
organic solvents [24]. The solvent-based monomer separation can raise
environmental concerns stemming from multiple factors (e.g., solvent

toxicity, potential emissions, and ecological
footprint) [30]. The
compositional complexity of plastics poses a technical challenge in
selectively separating targeted monomers. In the formulation of com-
mercial plastics, blending more than two types of polymers and com-
pounding additive chemicals to the polymeric backbone are common
practices to impart desirable physico-chemical features [31]. Also, a
vulnerability of plastics to be contaminated during their applications
requires cleaning and purification [32â34]. The necessity of pretreat-
ment steps compromises economic viability of plastic waste valorization
[27].

Based on the rationale, the thermo-chemical processes, including
pyrolysis, hydrothermal treatment, and gasification, emerge as prom-
ising platforms [35]. These approaches represent a high tolerance to the
complicate compositional nature of plastic wastes because they are
driven by the thermal cracking of chemical bonds, simultaneously pro-
ducing desired products. The distribution of resulting thermolytic
products from plastic wastes can be precisely tailored by manipulating
operating parameters (temperature, heating rate, residence time, reac-
tion medium, reactor type, and catalyst species) [36â38]. Therefore, the
thermo-chemical transformation offers an effective means to valorize
plastic wastes with different structural formations while pursuing a
circular economy in the petrochemical industry [39]. In this context,
numerous reviews have been devoted for summarizing the impact of
process parameters during the thermo-chemical conversion of plastic
wastes into syngas, transportation fuels, and base chemicals (Table S1).
However, most reviews focus on individual technologies, such as py-
rolysis, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction, and others. Although

thermo-chemical techniques, there is a lack of understanding the
physico-chemical properties of plastic wastes, the key factors in deter-
mining the optimal valorization routes. Additionally, the rationale
behind the suitability of thermo-chemical processes for plastic waste
valorization requires further justification.

To narrow this knowledge gap, this review aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of the valorization of plastic wastes into
chemicals and fuels through thermo-chemical processes. The review
begins with a statistical summary of the global generation of plastic
wastes (Section 2). To help understanding the physico-chemical prop-
erties and compositional complexities of plastics, their manufacturing
processes were investigated (Section 3). The fates of pollutants derived
from plastics are described in terms of the hazardous potential associ-
ated with improper disposal of plastic wastes (Section 4). Section 5 re-
ports the technical merits and demerits of various methodological
options for plastic waste disposal, highlighting the necessity of thermo-
chemical valorization. A significant emphasis was placed on the pyro-
lytic valorization of plastic wastes over other thermo-chemical processes
(gasification and hydrothermal treatment) by discussing the associated
technical characteristics (Section 6). This entails a comprehensive
summary of the thermolytic behaviors of plastics and the resulting py-
rogenic product distribution under diverse process parameters. Also, the
chemicals
recovered from plastic waste pyrolysis are compiled,
including monomers, light olefins, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
and xylene isomers (BTEX). Section 7 highlights the pyrolytic conver-
sion of plastic wastes into transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel,
jet fuel, and syngas. The technical strategies to attain higher yield and
selectivity towards target or specific chemicals are described. Finally,

Section 8 delves into the current challenges and future perspectives
surrounding the pyrolytic valorization of plastic wastes. This compre-
hensive exploration will help expand both conceptual and practical
understanding of the complexities and opportunities involved in the
valorization of plastic wastes, particularly with perspectives on the po-
tential of thermo-chemical processes to foster sustainable waste man-
agement practices.

2. Generation of plastic waste

The global production of plastics has undergone an exponential surge
(Fig. 1 (a)). In 2019 alone, 460 million tons of plastics were manufac-
tured, marking an increase of approximately 230 times over the pre-
ceding 70 years. Notably, the consumption pattern of plastics during this
period aligns with the trends observed in the global gross domestic
product (GDP) (Fig. 1 (a)). The GDP serves as a comprehensive indicator
encompassing all economic activities [40], reflecting the profound
integration of plastics into various industrial sectors. Plastics have
played a pervasive role in seven key industrial sectors: packaging, con-
struction, transportation, consumer products, textiles, electrical/elec-
tronic, and industrial machinery [41]. The packaging industry emerges
as the predominant consumer, accounting for the largest share in global
plastic consumption (31.0 wt%) followed by the construction sector
(16.7 wt%), transportation (13.7 wt%), consumer products (10.2 wt%),
textiles (9.6 wt%), electrical/electronic (3.8 wt%), and industrial ma-
chinery (0.6 wt%) (Fig. 1 (b)). This distribution underscores the inten-
sive/extensive utilization of plastics across diverse industrial domains,
highlighting their integral role in contemporary economic activities.

In 2019, the generation of plastic wastes reached 353 million tons,
constituting ~77 wt% of the global production of plastics [4]. This
substantial volume difference may be attributed to variations in the
lifespan of plastics across different industrial sectors and applications.
Notably, plastics employed in packaging exhibit a brief lifespan, often
less than a year. In contrast, the lifespan of plastics utilized in the con-
struction sector average ~35 years (Fig. 2 (a)). The impact of these
divergent lifespans is evident in the generation patterns of plastic wastes
(Fig. 2 (b)). Plastics used in packaging have shorter lifespan and are
promptly reflected in the generation of plastic wastes. Conversely, the
inflow of plastics used in the construction sector into the waste stream is
notably delayed, contributing to a lower and more gradual accumulation
of waste over time. Therefore, the service time or lifespan of plastics
plays a pivotal role in determining their generation rate. Plastics with
shorter lifespans such as those used in packaging contribute more
rapidly to the overall generation of plastic wastes compared to their
like construction.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial to develop effective waste

Plastic waste generation routes are categorized as pre-consumer and
post-consumer materials according to a report from the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO 14021:2016) [43]. Pre-consumer
material is defined as âmaterial diverted from a waste stream during a
manufacturing process,â typically occurring in plastic manufacturing
plants. Pre-consumer plastic wastes are characterized as clean and ho-
mogeneous, maintaining consistent quality. Meanwhile, post-consumer
material is defined as âmaterial generated by households or commercial,
consumers.â
industrial, and institutional
facilities
Post-consumer plastic wastes are commonly collected by public services,
often concentrated in municipal solid waste (MSW). Many developed
countries have adopted practices of separating and discarding plastic
wastes to promote plastic recycling [44]. However, plastic wastes within
MSW are heterogeneous, typically comprising more than six types of
plastics (such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density poly-
ethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and others) [45]. Addi-
tionally, these plastics are frequently disposed alongside various (in)
organic wastes, including food waste, textiles, paper, glass, and metal
[45]. Consequently, the recycling of plastic wastes faces significant
challenges owing to their complex nature within MSW [46]. The intri-
cate composition and co-disposal with other materials make the sepa-
ration and recycling of plastic wastes from MSW a complex and
demanding task.

3. Characterizations and compositional matrixes of plastic
waste

The manufacturing process of plastics provides valuable insights into
characterizing the physico-chemical properties of polymeric wastes.
Plastics undergo a series of well-defined manufacturing processes,
including fractional distillation, cracking and reforming, polymeriza-
tion, and compounding and processing (Fig. 3). These processes
sequentially contribute to the physico-chemical properties of plastics,
shaping their characteristics throughout production. The physico-
chemical properties of plastics can be influenced by several factors,
including the types of monomers and additives present in the plastics.
The selection of monomers (the building blocks of polymers) and the
incorporation of various additives during the manufacturing process
contribute to the diverse range of physico-chemical properties exhibited
by different types of plastics. Understanding these properties is essential
for effective waste management and recycling processes since it allows

for tailored approaches based on the specific characteristics of the
plastic materials involved.

C), naphtha (C4âC12, ~30 wt%, 30â200

Crude oil serves as a primary raw material in plastic production, with
over 8 wt% of crude oil utilized for this purpose [47]. It is a complex
mixture of hydrocarbons (HCs) with a wide distribution of carbon
numbers. The separation and purification of these HCs through frac-
tional distillation are optimized [48]. During fractional distillation,
crude oil is separated into distinct fractions, including liquid petroleum
gas (C1âC4, ~2 wt%, â¤30
C),
C), gas oil (C15âC25, ~40 wt%,
kerosene (C12âC15, ~20 wt%, 200â300
C), and residual oil/asphalt (â¥C25, ~8 wt%, â¥400
250â350
C) [49].
Liquid petroleum gas is a gaseous product, while most other fractions
consist of liquid products containing long-chained HCs [50]. The liquid
fractions (except for liquid petroleum gas) find applications as trans-
portation fuels owing to their high energy density and ease of storage
and transport [51]. However, the long-chained HCs present in these
liquid fractions are unsuitable as raw materials to obtain monomers in
plastic production [52]. It is necessary to shorten the carbon length of
the HCs to derive well-known monomeric materials such as light olefins
(ethylene, propylene, and butene) and monoaromatics (benzene,
toluene, and xylene isomers) [52]. Naphtha emerges as a desirable
fraction for manufacturing monomers among the distillation fractions. It
has a shorter carbon length compared to other distillation fractions such
as kerosene and gas oil. It is a mixture of alkanes, cycloalkanes, and
aromatics with a carbon range of C4âC12 [53]. The use of naphtha
streamlines the conversion routes, offering a simplified process for
monomer formation. This strategic choice facilitates the production of
monomers such as light olefins and monoaromatics, crucial building
blocks in plastic manufacturing processes.

Despite the advantages of naphtha in plastic production, its pro-
duction is associated with a significant drawbackâthe substantial gen-
eration of CO2 [54]. The elevated atmospheric concentration of CO2
exceeds the natural carbon sinkâs full capacity, leading to severe envi-
ronmental issues such as global warming [55]. In light of these concerns,
the use of biomass in plastic production has garnered considerable
attention owing to its intrinsic carbon neutrality [56]. However, the
direct utilization of biomass in plastic production is technically chal-
lenging owing to its complex nature [57]. This challenge is overcome by
processing the biomass into short-chained pyrogenic products (known as
biocrude) to facilitate the separation of specific chemical intermediates
to produce targeted monomers. This conversion is achieved through
processes such as pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) [58].

The compositional matrix of biocrude is highly dependent on the type of
biomass and the operational parameters used in the thermo-chemical
process. Biocrude is a complex mixture of organic compounds,
including HCs and oxygen-, nitrogen-, and sulfur-containing compounds
[59]. Despite the inherent heterogeneity of biocrude, the fractional
distillation process effectively separates monomeric compounds suitable
for plastic production [60]. This approach offers a more environmen-
tally sustainable alternative by utilizing biomass (a renewable resource)
and mitigating the environmental impact associated with traditional
plastic production processes that heavily rely on fossil fuels.

3.1.2. Cracking and reforming

â¦

The thermal cracking of naphtha with or without a catalyst is widely
employed to obtain a monomer, [61]. The cracking process of naphtha
encompasses three routes: thermal cracking, catalytic cracking, and
catalytic reforming (Table 1). Thermal cracking of naphtha is conducted
C, and it does not
at high temperatures ranging from 800 to 1000
involve the presence of a catalyst [62]. In this process, HCs in naphtha
undergo conversion into smaller molecules through free radical mech-
anisms [63]. The thermal degradation of HCs involves homolytic bond
scissions occurring at random positions, resulting in the formation of
free radicals at the ends of intermediate products [64]. These free rad-
icals initiate attacks on the C-C bonds situated at the beta position. The
consecutive beta-scissions induced by the free radicals create favorable
conditions for ethylene formation [64]. This thermal cracking process
serves as a key step in the production of monomers (particularly
ethylene) contributing to the subsequent synthesis of various plastics.

â¦

Catalytic cracking of naphtha is conducted in the presence of an acid
catalyst at a milder temperature (500
C) [65]. The acid catalyst pos-
sesses two active sites (BrÃ¸nsted and Lewis acids) that play a crucial role
in influencing the degradation mechanisms of HCs [66]. The BrÃ¸nsted
acid site donates a proton to HCs and forms a carbonium ion [67]. The
cracking by a carbonium ion leads to the generation of alkanes, subse-
quently resulting in the formation of a carbenium ion [68]. Meanwhile,
the Lewis acid site subtracts a hydride ion from HCs, forming a carbe-
nium ion [69]. The carbenium ion derived from both acidic sites initiates
the ionic chain scission of HCs at the beta position, producing propylene
[70]. Transition metals are introduced onto the surface of an acid
catalyst in the catalytic reformation of naphtha [71]. The active sites
provided by these metals and acids contribute to the formation of aro-
matic derivatives with a single benzene ring, including BTEX [72].
Transition metals like platinum catalyze the dehydrogenation of HCs,
while acid catalysts like alumina facilitate the cracking reaction of HCs
and their concurrent isomerization [73]. The adjustment of the distri-
bution of metals and acid sites can modify the reaction pathways,
thereby enhancing catalytic selectivity toward a target monomer [74].

3.2. Polymerization to produce plastics

The polymerization of a monomer is a crucial step in plastic pro-
duction [75,76]. The physico-chemical properties of the polymer can be
highly sensitive to the type of monomer used since a polymer is
composed of specific repeating units (monomers) [77]. The molecular
structure and polarity of a monomer play a significant role in creating
variations in the physico-chemical properties of the resulting polymer
[78,79]. An overview for the physico-chemical properties of eight
representative polymers is summarized in Table 2. Table 3 offers a
detailed description of the structural formation, functionality, and ap-
plications associated with each polymer for a more comprehensive un-
derstanding. Similar characteristics for other polymers, comprising 12
synthetic polymers and 4 biopolymers, are summarized in Tables S2 and
S3. This information is valuable to elucidate the diverse characteristics
and applications of different polymers, contributing to the broader
knowledge of plastic materials in various industries.

Polymers are categorized into two groups: non-polar and polar
polymers. Non-polar polymer is comprised of the hydrocarbon backbone
without the presence of a polar functional linkage [89]. The character-
istics of non-polar polymers are primarily governed by the distance
between the polymeric chains [90]. The intermolecular forces (such as
van der Waals forces) are weakened when the polymer chains are loosely
arranged [91] which influences the physico-chemical properties [92].
Representative examples of non-polar polymers include PE, PP, and PS
[80]. PE is composed of a repeating structure of ethylene monomers
[93], and is further classified into HDPE, LDPE, and linear low-density
polyethylene (LLDPE) [80]. The properties of these polymers can be
modified by adjusting the carbon length of the side chains connected to
the PE polymeric backbone [80]. HDPE is characterized by a linear
structure without side chains that exhibits closely located chains leading
to a dense arrangement that imparts crystallinity, tensile strength, and
thermal resistance [94,95]. In contrast, LDPE and LLDPE have lower
thermo-chemical stability and greater flexibility compared to HDPE [94,

8

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101219

96]. These features are attributed to deliberately broadening the dis-
tance between the PE chains, resulting in a less densely packed structure
[97].

PP is composed of repeating propylene monomers [98]. The inclu-
sion of a methyl linkage in PP introduces a specific spatial arrangement
between the polymeric chains [99]. The physico-chemical properties of
PP are influenced by the orientation (tacticity) of the methyl linkage
connected to the hydrocarbon chain [98]. Arrangement of the methyl
linkage in PP on one side facilitates the PP chains to be tightly packed,
resulting in high crystallinity and excellent resistance to heat, solvents,
and mechanical stress [77,82,100]. Similarly, PS is made up of repeating
styrene monomers [101]. The arrangement of a phenyl linkage in PS
determines its tacticity [101]. The aromatic structure of PS imparts high
rigidity, stiffness, and dimensional stability [102,103]. However, the
commercial applications of PS are likely restricted because it is brittle
and less ductile [104]. Despite its limitations, PS remains valuable in
specific applications where its unique combination of properties is
advantageous.

Certain polymers, such as PVC, PET, polyamide (PA), and others
incorporate functional linkages containing heteroatoms like oxygen,
nitrogen, chlorine, and so on. The strong electronegativity of these
heteroatoms imparts specific polarity to these polymers [75,77]. The
polar interactions between the polymer chains are particularly sensitive
to the type of functional linkages, influencing their structural arrange-
ments [79,90]. The robust intermolecular strength resulting from the
polar interactions among polymer molecules contributes to enhanced
mechanical and thermal stability compared to non-polar polymers [77].
A wide variety of plastics has been produced and utilized across
consumer and industrial sectors (Tables 2 and 3). However, over 70 wt%
of global plastic production comprises of five polymers: PE, PP, PVC,
PET, and PS [105]. The massive consumption of these polymers can be
attributed to their cost-effective production within the well-established
manufacturing infrastructure [106]. Additionally, their excellent pro-
cessability facilitates easy modification of shapes and physico-chemical
properties, allowing for versatile applications with general purposes
[90]. Despite the versatility of these polymers, their practical use in the
industrial and engineering sectors has certain limitations [107]. Specific
functional linkages (such as amide, carbonate, and so on) have been
incorporated to produce engineering polymers like PA, polycarbonate
(PC), and so on to address the requirements for applications in these
sectors (Tables S2 and S3). These engineering polymers exhibit superior
physico-chemical properties compared to the representative ones [108].
This strategic use of functional linkages enhances the performance and
applicability of plastics in demanding industrial and engineering
applications.

In contrast to synthetic polymers, the production of biopolymers
involves the use of raw materials derived from renewable resources,
specifically biomass (Tables S2 and S3). Biopolymers are defined as bio-
derived or biodegradable polymers [109]. Bio-based polymers either
entirely or partially replace fossil resources with biomass in the pro-
duction of synthetic polymers [110,111]. This alternative use of biomass
provides a promising opportunity to reduce the excessive dependence on
fossil resources [112,113]. Biodegradable polymers are manufactured
using raw materials derived from biomass and these polymers can be
degraded by microorganisms under natural environmental conditions
[114]. Despite the significant advantages of biopolymers, their com-
mercial applications are relatively uncommon owing to challenges in
meeting physico-chemical properties comparable to synthetic polymers
[115]. The consumption of biopolymers currently represents less than 1
wt% of global plastic production [89,116].

Most polymers possess intrinsic characteristics imparted by a single
monomer known as homopolymers [90]. However, their commercial
use may be limited under certain conditions. For instance, the styrene
monomer in PS provides it with rigidity, stiffness, and dimensional
stability [117]. Nevertheless, the brittleness of PS (particularly in terms
of low impact strength) hinders its practical applications [118]. Two or

more monomers are sequentially arranged to form a single polymer
chain resulting in a copolymer to address the deficient properties of
polymers [119]. Copolymers are designed to combine different me-
chanical and chemical properties [120]. Well-known examples of co-
polymers include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high impact
polystyrene (HIPS), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) [77]. Styrene
monomer is commonly copolymerized with rubbery components such as
butadiene to counter the brittleness of PS. This strategic blending of
monomers enhances the overall properties of the polymer, making it
more suitable for a broader range of applications.

3.3. Compounding and processing to produce finished plastics

3.3.1. Polymer blends and additives

In addition to copolymerization, blending more than two polymers
presents an effective approach to improve the deficient properties of a

single monomer (Table S4). Polymer blends compensate for specific
characteristics of one polymer (acting as a matrix) by leveraging the
advantages of another polymer (serving as a modifier). This blending
strategy in the manufacture of polymeric materials has garnered
considerable attention owing to its low operational cost. Furthermore,
polymers can be blended without the need for chemical bonding. These
technical advantages have resulted in over 30 wt% of the total polymer
production prepared by polymer blends [77,79,90,106]. Consequently,
the characteristics of polymer blends can be manipulated by controlling
the types of component polymers and their composition [77].

The physico-chemical characteristics of polymers can be precisely
adjusted through the incorporation of specific additive chemicals, such
as plasticizers, flame retardants, heat stabilizers, colorants, and others
(Table S5). The compounding process further endows the polymers with
targeted or specific features without necessitating any alteration to the
matrix polymer. These additive chemicals find their placement and

interaction between the polymer chains. Typically, each additive
chemical establishes physical bonds with the polymer chains. The spe-
cific functions and detailed information pertaining to various polymer
blends and additive chemicals are provided in Tables S4 and S5,
respectively.

3.3.2. Molding/shaping and assembly

Compounded materials are typically molded to conform to the spe-
cific shape of each component plastic in the production of finalized
plastics. Each component plastic serves a distinct function that aligns
with the requirements of the end product. Following the molding pro-
cess, the shaped component plastics are assembled to create the finished
products. Consequently, the assembled and finalized plastic products
encompass a diverse array of polymers and additive chemicals [121].
These facts underscore the intricate compositional matrix inherent in
finished plastics. A visual representation detailing the type and mass of
each component polymer present in the finished products is shown to
facilitate a clearer understanding of this heterogeneous nature (Fig. 4).
The computer monitor serves as a representative example of elec-
tronic waste (Fig. 4 (a)). The monitor is divided into five distinct sec-
tions, including frame parts, metals, printed circuit boards, display
panels, and others. The components are constructed using seven
different polymers not including the metal parts. For instance, HIPS is
chosen for the monitorâs frame owing to its exceptional impact strength,
constituting the largest proportion (18.34 wt%) of the total mass. Pol-
ymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is employed to provide transparency to
the display panel and significantly contributes (11.35 wt%) to the
overall mass of the monitor. Other polymers such as ABS, PC, PET,
epoxy, and so on are utilized to impart specific functionalities to the
monitor. This scenario is not unique to computer monitors; other com-
mercial products like face masks, disposable diapers, and others also
consist of various component plastics [90]. Furthermore, the inclusion
of additive chemicals enhances the heterogeneity of the finished prod-
ucts [124]. As discussed in Section 3, the physico-chemical properties of
plastics are systematically acquired through a series of manufacturing
processes.

4. Environmental impacts from inappropriate disposal process
of plastic waste

The issue of plastic waste is characterized by its intricate and diverse
composition, further compounded by the contamination that occurs
during the use of plastics. This complexity poses a hazard risk since
plastic waste has the potential to release harmful substances into the
environment. Consequently, there is a pressing need to identify envi-
ronmentally friendly disposal methods for plastic waste. Despite this
urgency, ~22 wt%, of plastic waste is discharged into the ecosystem
without undergoing proper treatment [4]. This mismanaged disposal of
plastic waste takes various forms, including uncontrolled dumpsites,

open-pit burning, and leakage into terrestrial and aquatic environments.
Specifically, developing countries face intensified challenges in man-
aging plastic waste owing to inadequate infrastructure for waste
collection and treatment facilities [125,126]. Consequently, inappro-
priate disposal practices have led to the widespread distribution of
plastic waste in the environment, exacerbating environmental pollution
and health risks. Efforts to address these challenges include the devel-
opment of effective waste management systems, increased awareness of
responsible disposal practices, and the promotion of recycling and
environmentally friendly alternatives to plastic use.

A significant proportion of plastic waste (~50 wt%) is treated
through landfilling, while 19 wt% undergoes incineration [127].
Simultaneously, recycling of plastic waste only accounted for ~9 wt%.
The dominance of the conventional methods provides a relatively
straightforward and cost-effective means to prevent the release of
plastics into the ecosystem to some extent [128,129]. However, it is
crucial to exercise caution in the management of landfilling and incin-
eration processes since uncontrolled discharges of pollutants can readily
occur. This section aims to shed light on the pathways through which
pollutants are generated from the inappropriate disposal of plastic waste
and their subsequent fates.

4.1. Fates of pollutants stemming from plastic waste

Plastic waste mismanagement is a significant contributor to their
inevitable release into the ecosystem, and the transportation of these
wastes is strongly influenced by their size and physico-chemical prop-
erties [130,131]. Low density plastics are particularly susceptible to
transport through weathering processes such as wind, runoff, and waves
[132,133]. Consequently, these plastics are frequently found in various
aquatic environments, including shorelines, open oceans, and deep-sea
areas. Their distributions in nature pose critical environmental threats
on all living creatures. Animals face severe consequences from plastic
waste. They can become entangled in plastic debris or mistakenly ingest
it, leading to choking, digestive system impairment, internal damage
(bleeding, abrasion, ulceration, etc.), and ultimately death [134â138].
The occurrence of MPs is considered an emerging environmental
concern owing to their unprecedented environmental fates [139].
Despite the recalcitrant nature of plastics, weathering processes such as
photolysis and hydrolysis degrade them into micro-sized particles (â¤5
mm). The reduction in particle size leading to the formation of MPs
increases the likelihood of natural degradation [140â143]. This reduc-
tion in particle size also results in an increase in specific surface area,
influencing the interactions of MPs with the environment [144].

Plastic photodegradation promotes their fragmentation through
exposure to sunlight. Polymeric chains can undergo dissociation when
plastics are irradiated by sunlight. Additive chemicals in plastics are
released during photodegradation because they are weakly bound to the
polymer matrix [145]. Furthermore, processing aids (such as catalysts
and solvents) and other impurities (residual monomers and contami-
nants) are liberated in plastics [146,147]. The photolysis of plastics can

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101219

serve as a potential source of MPs and toxic chemicals [148]. However,
plastic photodegradation is contingent on their locations. MPs (partic-
ularly those with low density and high buoyancy) are favorably
degraded when they float on the water [149]. The hydrolysis of MPs is
less restricted by their location compared to photolysis [150]. The hy-
drolysis process is sensitive to the functional groups present in the MPs,
such as ester, ether, anhydride, amide, urea, urethane, and so on [151].
The dissociation of these functional groups in MPs is closely related to
the monomers. Notably, these degradation pathways contribute to
decreasing the average mass of MPs [152], increasing the likelihood of
their uptake by microorganisms [153]. However, the low biodegrad-
ability of MPs makes their complete removal challenging [138].
Consequently, plastics are a significant source of pollution, accelerating
the release of MPs and other pollutants into the environment [154]. The
intricate processes involving plastic photodegradation underscore the
importance of comprehensively addressing plastic waste management to
minimize its environmental impact.

The hydrophobic nature of MPs is considered a vector for the
transport of (in)organic pollutants. The hydrophobicity of MPs is
contingent on the type of plastic. Plastics such as PE, PP, and PS exhibit
strong hydrophobicity owing to their non-polar characteristics. Plastics
with polar natures such as PVC, PET, PA, and others, can display hy-
drophobicity due to strong intermolecular forces. Various organic pol-
lutants, including PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides,
and so on are commonly found in all environmental media. These
organic pollutants typically possess high aromaticity, characterized by a
high ratio of carbon to hydrogen [155]. In aquatic environments, these
organic pollutants interact with other hydrophobic media, such as MPs.
Consequently, organic pollutants adsorbed onto the surface of MPs can
migrate [156]. Simultaneously, heavy metals and metalloids are
immobilized on the surface of MPs through complexation processes
[157]. These convoluted interactions contribute to the recalcitrant na-
ture of MPs contaminated with pollutants. MPs carrying (in)organic
pollutants are toxic to various living organisms [158]. The bio-
accumulation of MPs associated with pollutants presents a potentially
lethal and hazardous risk to human beings [159]. The degradation rate
of MPs is slow in natural environments [152]. This slow degradation
raises concerns about the full extent of the damaging implications posed
by MPs. This phenomenon is often referred to as a âplastic toxicity debt,â
indicating that the potential risks of MPs chronically persist over time
(Fig. 5). Consequently, it becomes crucial to establish appropriate pro-
tocols for plastic waste disposal.

4.2. Landfilling of plastic waste

Landfilling has been a commonly preferred practice for the disposal
of plastic wastes owing to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness [160]. The
primary objective of landfilling is preventing the discharge of plastic
wastes into the surrounding environment for an extended period. The
incorporation of impermeable liners that can be made of materials like
clay or polymers helps in the sanitary isolation of plastic wastes at
designated landfill sites [161]. This setup aims to block the contami-
nation of nearby soil and groundwater under controlled operational
conditions. Organic components undergo degradation processes in
landfill environments, including hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and meth-
anogenesis, resulting in methane production [162]. While there is a
technical merit in gaining energy resources from this process, the con-
version of plastic wastes into methane is not readily achieved owing to
their non-biodegradable nature [160]. The high molecular weight of
plastics hinders the accessibility of microorganisms to the polymer

biodegradation owing to their strong intermolecular structure compared
to amorphous polymers [164]. Consequently, plastic waste biodegra-
dation is significantly delayed in landfill.

pollutants. Plastic wastes gradually fragment into smaller pieces, such as
MPs to accelerate the subsequent release of monomers and additive
chemicals. These intermediate pollutants can steadily accumulate
within landfill sites [165]. Nevertheless, the unintended leakage of
landfill leachate can only occur if there is an accidental crack in the
impermeable liner [21]. This leachate may contaminate the surrounding
environment with pollutants, including MPs and toxic chemicals. The
situation becomes more complex when plastic wastes are buried
alongside other organic wastes in a single landfill site [166]. The
resulting leachate contains various toxic pollutants, such as PAHs, heavy
metals, bacteria, and so on, originating from the decomposition of
organic wastes [166]. The presence of MPs in the leachate play a sig-
nificant role in the migration of (in)organic contaminants to the
ecosystem [21]. As such, landfilling of plastic wastes could be recog-
nized as a potential contributor to critical environmental problems
[167].

4.3. Incineration of plastic waste

The incineration of plastic waste is considered an alternative to the
landfilling process as a precautionary means to mitigate the hazardous
risks associated with MPs. It presents technical advantages, including
immediate volume reduction of wastes and the recovery of thermal
energy [168]. Specifically, over 90 % of plastic wastes can be reduced in
volume since thermoplastics are volatilized at temperatures equal to or
greater than 500
C [35]. This helps minimize the landfill space needed
for the residual ash. For instance, the presence of non-flammable ther-
mosets and other inorganics (metals/metalloids) can lead to the

â¦

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101219

formation of ash [166]. Furthermore, the incineration of plastic wastes
allows for the recovery of a substantial amount of thermal energy since
the oxidation of plastics is an exothermic reaction. The calorific value of
plastics is comparable to that of liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel
[168]. Therefore, there is an opportunity to reduce heavy reliance on
fossil resources by utilizing the energy content of plastic waste.

The incineration of plastic wastes comes with its own set of chal-
lenges and potential hazardous risks, particularly related to technical
incompleteness in terms of air pollution controls (APCs). Achieving
complete oxidation of plastics is not readily realized owing to technical
challenges in controlling the ER [169]. The combustion process is
significantly influenced by the diffusion of oxidant [170]. The diffusion
flame tends to be delayed owing to the insufficient mixing between
oxidant (air) and fuel (plastic) [171]. The high molecular weight of
plastics contributes to a considerable retardance in flame speed,
providing a favorable environment for the formation of air pollutants
such as CO, UHCs, VOCs, PAHs, and others [172].

The incineration of plastics with high aromaticity, such as PS, PET,
PUR, and others, raises concerns. The thermal stability of aromatic
compounds effectively limits complete oxidation during incineration
[173]. Furthermore, the presence of aromatic compounds serves as a
precursor that can spontaneously recombine, leading to the formation of
PAHs. The formation of benzene and its derivatives is a rate-determining
step for the formation of PAHs. The high hydrophobicity of PAHs means
that they can readily adsorb to organic materials, posing hazardous risks
in terms of their environmental behaviors and fates. Moreover, the
presence of other atomic elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, and
others in plastics contributes to the formation of toxic chemicals during
combustion. This includes nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx),
polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and furans (PCDDs/Fs), PCBs, and
other harmful substances. The release of these toxic chemicals into the
air during incineration poses environmental and health risks, and their
behavior in the environment must be carefully considered.

5. Technical candidates for recycling plastic waste

The conventional disposal platforms for plastic wastes come with
inherent challenges and risks,
including the unwanted release of
emerging pollutants into the ecosystem. Therefore, the search for and
development of environmentally benign disposal platforms for plastic
wastes are of great importance [174]. In this context, plastic recycling
emerges as a better and more viable approach [78]. Various technical
methods exist for recycling plastic wastes, encompassing primary, sec-
ondary, and tertiary recycling processes. These processes are designed to
obtain raw materials and produce new plastics from recycled plastic
materials. The technical merits and demerits of each recycling strategy
are summarized in Table 4.

5.1. Primary recycling process: plastic waste-to-plastics

The primary recycling process involves the re-use of plastic wastes to
produce new plastic materials for the same applications [174]. In this
process, recycled plastics exhibit nearly identical physico-chemical
properties compared to the original materials. Plastic wastes are me-
chanically processed through the re-extrusion process, which is effective
when the plastic wastes are not contaminated. Typically, industrial
plastic wastes such as scraps and edges generated from plastic
manufacturing plants serve as the main resource for primary recycling.
Reprocessing these industrial plastic wastes back into the production
cycle allows for recycling within a closed-loop system. The success of
mechanical recycling depends on the purity of the plastic wastes. Un-
contaminated plastic waste is efficiently processed through mechanical
recycling. Industrial plastic wastes that are often generated in controlled
manufacturing environments are well-suited for primary recycling. One
challenge in recycling plastic wastes is the lack of information on the
constituents of the plastics. However, manufacturers can provide in-
formation about the constitutional matrices of plastic wastes, enabling
the proper implementation of mechanical recycling. Detailed informa-
tion regarding the constituents of plastic wastes is crucial to ensure the
quality and performance of the recycled materials in subsequent appli-
cations. Addressing this constraint is essential for the successful and
sustainable practice of primary recycling in closed-loop systems.

5.2. Secondary recycling process: plastic waste-to-polymers

The secondary recycling process is also a mechanical process.
However, this practice involves additional separation/purification pro-
cesses to obtain a specific polymer from plastic wastes [175]. This
process requires a series of pre-treatment steps, including sorting,
cleaning, and shredding. In the sorting step, plastic wastes are separated
based on various criteria, such as manual sorting, density differences,
and/or spectroscopic analysis. Hand sorting may involve visually iden-
tifying and segregating different types of plastics. Density-based sepa-
ration utilizes the differences in the densities of various plastics.
Spectroscopic analysis involves techniques like infrared spectroscopy to
identify and sort plastics based on their chemical composition.
Following plastic sorting, cleaning removes contaminants such as labels,
adhesives, or residues from the plastics. Subsequently, shredding breaks
down the plastics into smaller pieces to facilitate further processing.

Nevertheless, sorting a targeted polymer from plastic wastes is
challenging since these wastes are mostly composite materials consisting
of more than two polymers. The presence of additive chemicals and
other impurities such as residual monomers and contaminants is
considered a major constraint to separate a clean, single polymer.

Dissolution and precipitation offer a strategic approach to recover a
specific polymer. A specific solvent selectively dissolves a polymer,
considering its polar/non-polar interactions [176]. Filtration of the
polymer-dissolved solvent removes impurities and the targeted polymer
can be precipitated. Importantly, dissolution does not cause significant
changes in its chemical structure. Consequently, the recovered polymer
can be utilized to produce plastic materials for the same purpose [177].
Considering the reversible nature of thermoplastics in response to
physical modification, thermal processing techniques such as extrusion
and injection molding emerge as strategic approaches for their repetitive
utilization [24]. Nevertheless, the recurrent exposure to heat and shear
stress results in the degradation of recycled plastics. The melt flow index
(MFI) of plastics undergoes changes with an increasing number of
reprocessing events via extrusion/injection molding (Fig. 6) [178]. A
decrease in molecular weight is observed in most recycled polymers,
leading to an augmented MFI. This is attributed to random and uncon-
trollable bond scissions in the polymeric backbones. Conversely, the
molecular weight of select polymers experiences a marginal increase
owing to the recombination of intermediate products. These findings
indicate that repetitive thermal reprocessing induces alterations in the
physico-chemical properties of recycled materials. Consequently, the
mechanical recycling process may not constitute a sustainable avenue
for recycling plastic wastes, primarily owing to their limited lifespan.

5.3. Tertiary recycling process: plastic waste-to-monomers

The tertiary recycling process (chemical recycling process) allows
the conversion of plastic wastes into value-added chemicals [180]. The
recovery of a monomer offers a sustainable solution from the perspective
of a circular economy considering that plastics are comprised of specific
repeating units (monomers). Plastic wastes can be converted into
monomers using specific techniques such as solvolysis and enzymolysis
[181,182]. Subsequent repolymerization of the monomers enables the
production of new plastics. Therefore, the quality of recycled plastics
can be maintained regardless of the number of recycling cycles.

The chemical recycling process is specifically suited for polar plastics
such as PET, PUR, PA, PC, and so on, and hinges on the presence of
functional linkages containing C-O bonds, C-N bonds, or others. The
unsymmetrical electron distribution in these polar functional groups
makes them susceptible to dissociation through nucleophilic attacks
under
plastics
[183],
thermo-chemical conditions [184]. Selective cleavage of ester, urethane,
amine, and carbamate linkages in these plastics readily occurs [185].
The success of a solvolysis route is highly dependent on the choice of
solvent. Various solvents such as methanol, water, ethylene glycol (EG),
methylamine, and ammonia (NH3) can be employed, each leading to

distinct depolymerization processes such as methanolysis, hydrolysis,
glycolysis, aminolysis, and ammonolysis, respectively [186]. A notable
technical challenge associated with solvolysis is influenced by the
chemical affinity between solvents and functional groups [183]. The
slow mass transition of solvents into the polymer matrix owing to their
high molecular moiety hinders on the reaction kinetics in solvolysis
[187]. Solvolysis is often conducted under harsh operating conditions
and in the presence of catalysts to overcome these slow reaction rates
[188].

Enzymolysis emerges as a promising technical approach, offering
milder operational conditions compared to solvolysis [189]. This
method involves the enzymatic conversion of plastic wastes into
monomers or oligomers [190]. Enzymatic degradation is particularly
effective for polar plastics, given that enzymes are metabolically acti-
vated in an aqueous environment. However, hydrolytic degradation by
enzymes faces challenges owing to poor accessibility of the polymer.
Moreover, enzymatic hydrolysis is easily impeded by trace amounts of
toxic substances present in plastics, rendering the process recalcitrant.
The discussion in this section provides a comprehensive overview of
the technical strengths and weaknesses associated with various recy-
cling strategies for plastic wastes. The widely employed mechanical
recycling leads to a gradual deterioration of the physico-chemical
properties of recycled plastics. The challenge of sorting a clean or sin-
gle plastic from the inherently heterogeneous nature of waste plastics
poses a significant hurdle to this method [191]. Selective dissolution for
a desired polymer effectively extracts additive chemicals and impurities;
however, trace amounts of these components in the dissolved polymer
can inhibit subsequent solvolysis processes. Compounding these chal-
lenges are the limited public accessibility to the plastic manufacturing
process and insufficient information on the constituents of plastics,
which hinder the informed selection of solvents for dissolution and
solvolysis. Additionally, the necessity for additional unit operations like
distillation and purification to separate surplus solvents and byproducts
contributes to the financial burden of recycling plastic wastes. There is a
pressing need to explore environmentally benign disposal platforms that
exhibit a high tolerance for the heterogeneous nature of plastic wastes
given the technical complexities involved in achieving a clean and
single-polymer separation.

6. Chemical production from plastic waste via thermo-chemical
processes

A thermo-chemical process presents as an appealing option for the
valorization of plastic waste [192â194], particularly owing to its lower
sensitivity to impurities and contaminants present in the plastic waste
stream [195]. This section discusses various thermo-chemical processes
employed for the valorization of plastic waste, including gasification,
hydrothermal liquefaction, and pyrolysis. These processes offer poten-
tial avenues to convert plastic waste into valuable products by
controlled thermal and chemical treatments, to minimize the impact of
impurities on the overall efficiency of the valorization process. The
technical merits/demerits

thermo-chemical processes are summarized in Table 5.

6.1. Gasification

Gasification involves converting the calorific value of carbonaceous
materials (including plastics) into combustible gases using a gasifying
agent (air, oxygen, steam, and supercritical water) [196]. The primary
gaseous products generated from plastic waste through gasification
include syngas (H2 and CO; 11.9â91.6 vol%) and light HCs (C2âC4;
1.4â27.4 % vol%) (Table S6). The distribution of gas products is influ-
enced by the type of gasifying agent employed. For instance, the calorific
values of gas products obtained from air gasification are lower by a
factor of 3.5 owing to the high content of inert gas (N2) in air [197].
Oxygen offers a technical advantage for enhancing the calorific value of

14

gaseous products without the diluting effect of N2. However, the high
operational cost associated with separating oxygen from air is a major
constraint for oxygen gasification. Steam can be used as a gasifying
agent to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. Steam gasification is well-suited
for practical applications aimed at synthesizing value-added chemicals
owing to the high molar ratio of H2 to CO, Nevertheless, steam gasifi-
cation is inherently endothermic, requiring high operational tempera-
tures to compensate for the significant amount of thermal energy
needed. Diverse studies on the three gasification processes of plastic
waste have been conducted, and their operational conditions and syngas
productivities are summarized in Table S6.

â¦

In air gasification, the yield and composition of gasifying products
are dependent on the ER, which represents the molar ratio between the
oxygen used in practice and the oxygen required for stoichiometric
oxidation. An increase in ER often enhances the production of syngas
from plastic waste. For instance, the reaction temperature of the air
gasification of waste PP using a fluidized bed increased from 703 to
915
C as the ER increased from 0.2 to 0.45, owing to the exothermic
nature of the gasification process [198]. The increase in ER until the
stoichiometric ratio resulted in increased syngas production. The con-
centrations of H2 and CO were the highest at ER values of 0.35 and 0.25,
respectively. This is likely because tar is further converted into syngas at
elevated temperatures. However, a continuous increase in ER beyond
the stoichiometric ratio noticeably decreased the higher heating value
(cid:0) 3. Other
(HHV) of the gasification products from 11.4 to 5.2 MJ m
studies similarly observed that an increase in ER beyond the stoichio-
metric ratio significantly decreased the calorific value of syngas (H2, CO,
and CH4) derived from mixed plastic wastes (comprising PE, PP, PS,
PVC, PMMA, and PET) [199â201]. This is likely due to the dilution effect
caused by the increased N2 content. Moreover, surplus oxidants result in
additional oxidation of gasification products, leading to an increase in
CO2 content in the gasification product. The enhanced formation of CO2
may intensify the dilution effect, further decreasing the calorific values
of the gasification product.

â¦

(cid:0) 3, and a lower heating value (LHV) of 6 MJ m

The presence of tar in syngas poses a challenge for its practical
application in energy production. The tar content in syngas needs to be
(cid:0) 3 for gas turbines
(cid:0) 3 [202] and lower than 1 mg m
lower than 10 mg m
for effective utilization in internal combustion engines [203]. To address
this issue, various catalysts were employed as gasifier bed materials to
reduce tar content in syngas derived from plastic waste. The use of
dolomite and olivine as gasifier bed materials for PP results in 92 wt%
and 40 wt% tar reductions compared to silica sand, respectively [204].
Air gasification of polyolefin waste mixtures using olivine as a catalytic
(cid:0) 1, tar content of â¤2 g
bed material achieves a syngas yield of 6 m3 kg
(cid:0) 3 at ER of 0.35 and
m
C [205]. This syngas could be applied to catalytic steam reforming
829
and water-gas-shift reactions without the need for further purification.
The tar reduction performance of olivine was attributed to the presence
of magnesium and iron, which act as promoters for the further cracking
of intermediate species [206]. The use of catalysts in gasification pro-
cesses emerges as a promising strategy to mitigate tar-related challenges
and enhance the quality of the produced syngas for energy applications.
Several studies have employed pure oxygen as a gasifying agent to
enhance the calorific value of syngas. Oxygen gasification of plastic
waste yields syngas free of N2, resulting in a relatively higher calorific
value. Oxygen gasification of a plastic waste mixture in a pilot-scale
moving grate gasifier produces syngas primarily consisting of H2, CO,
and CH4 with negligible diluting gases like N2, and with up to a HHV of
(cid:0) 3, making it suitable to operate a gas turbine [207]. Oxygen
10 MJ m
gasification of an automotive shredder residue achieves a syngas HHV of
12.8 MJ m
C with an ER of 0.32 [208]. However, obtaining
purified oxygen through an air separation unit (ASU) incurs a high
operating cost. The ASU in a gasification plant can account for â¥5 % of
plant power and approximately 15 % of the plant cost [209]. This cost
factor is considered a significant challenge that hinders the widespread
commercial use of the oxygen gasification process.

Steam gasification has the advantage of enhancing the fraction of H2
in syngas compared to air or oxygen gasification. Continuous steam
gasification of HDPE waste was conducted using a conical spouted bed
reactor [210]. The yield of syngas increased from 148 to 179 % with an
increase in reaction temperature from 800 to 900
C. The higher gasi-
fication temperature promotes steam reforming, resulting in a H2-rich
syngas. However, the use of steam can facilitate tar formation owing to
its relatively lower oxidation capacity compared to air or oxygen.
Olivine and alumina were employed as bed materials to mitigate tar
formation in the steam gasification of HDPE [210]. Olivine is more
effective at reducing tar than alumina, despite achieving a relatively
modest tar reduction of below 20 %. This highlights the potential of
using specific bed materials to enhance the performance of steam gasi-
fication processes and produce cleaner syngas suitable for various
applications.

â¦

Various metal catalysts such as Ru, Rh, Pt, Ni, and Co were evaluated
to further enhance the catalytic effect for tar reforming in steam gasi-
fication. Nickel (Ni) is particularly popular for steam reforming of tar
owing to its cost-effectiveness [211] and high activity for C-H bond
activation, contributing to the conversion of HCs into H2-rich syngas
[212]. Increasing the temperature from 700 to 900
C using a NiO/Al2O3
catalyst to convert PE waste into syngas increases the syngas yield from
37.2 to 64.4 vol% with a H2/CO ratio of 1.35 [213]. Ni/Al2O3 catalysts
achieve high H2 yield from HIPS and ABS in an integrated system of
pyrolysis and gasification [214]. The use of Ni/Al2O3 leads to compa-
rable H2 concentrations between HIPS (64.1 vol%) and ABS (64.2 vol%),
with the Ni catalyst more effective on ABS. Seam gasification of HDPE
over a commercial catalyst formulated with NiO, CaAl2O3, and Al2O3
(G90) in a conical spouted bed pyrolizer at 700
C followed by a steam
reformer converts 83 wt% of hydrogen in HDPE into H2, achieving a
H2/CO molar ratio of 6.2 [215]. However, Ni catalysts are prone to
deactivation by coke formation [216]. The introduction of Mg into Ni-Al
catalyst to form Ni-Mg-Al prolongs the catalystâs lifetime for steam
gasification of PP, HDPE, and PS by imparting resistance to coke for-
mation [217]. The mass of carbon deposited on the catalyst was reduced
with increased Mg content [218]. Simultaneously, the mechanistic
function of Ni for the production of H2-rich syngas was not impeded
[219]. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst significantly
decreased from 11.4 to 1.6 wt% while the metal loading of the Ni-Mg-Al
catalyst did not markedly affect the yield and composition of gasifica-
tion products at comparable operating conditions. This observation
suggests that coke formation on the Ni-Mg-Al catalyst was suppressed
when increasing the amount of active metal sites.

â¦

Meanwhile, Ru catalysts were explored for steam reforming of plastic
waste to produce H2-rich syngas. Increasing the Ru loading from 0.5 to
5.0 wt% on Ru/Al2O3 in steam gasification of PP enhances syngas pro-
duction from 50 to 98 vol% and concurrently decreases coke formation
from 20 to 0.6 vol% [220]. The high capability of Ru for hydrogen
activation increases the reducibility of reactants, thereby suppressing
coke formation [221]. Consequently, the increase in Ru loading provides
a favorable condition for further reduction of coke. The highest yield of
syngas through steam reforming of PS using a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (Ru
loading: 4.4 wt) was achieved at a temperature that is approximately
200
C lower than using a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (Ni loading: 5 wt%) [222].
This suggests that Ru catalysts have the potential to achieve efficient
steam reforming at lower temperatures, indicating their suitability for
specific applications in plastic waste valorization processes.

6.2. Hydrothermal treatment

Hydrothermal treatment is a thermo-chemical process that converts
plastic wastes into a crude-like liquid [185]. During this process, the
solvent plays a crucial role in depolymerizing the polymeric bonds
present in plastic waste. The physico-chemical properties of the solvent
(such as dielectric constant and ionic strength) depend on the reaction
temperature and pressure [223]. Its characteristic features rapidly

15

â¦

change as the solvent approaches a critical point [224], leading to
enhanced solubility of plastics and promoting thermo-chemical con-
version [225]. Water serves as a catalyst to selectively convert polar
polymers into monomers through the ionic mechanism under subcritical
conditions (Tc < 373
C, Pc < 22.1 MPa) [223], while the supercritical
water plays a role as a non-polar solvent. The improved accessibility of
supercritical water to non-polar polymers enables their degradation via
free radical mechanisms [223]. The bond scission of the polymeric
backbone in plastics forms free radicals at the end of intermediate
products. The degradation process by free radicals is completed by
accepting hydrogen, and the saturation of free radicals is induced by
hydrogen, preventing their unintended recombination [226]. Despite
the high yield of crude-like liquid from plastic waste, the harsh reaction
conditions of HTL for plastic waste are a significant drawback that limits
their industrial application. Table S7 lists various hydrothermal con-
version processes applied to valorizing plastic waste.

â¦

Hydrothermal conversion tests on various plastics (ABS, epoxy resin,
HDPE, LDPE, PA6, PA66, PET, PC, PP, PS, and PUR) under subcritical
conditions (350
C for 20 min under autogenous pressure) shows that
non-polar plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, and PS) exhibit limited degrad-
ability, with only 5 wt% conversion owing to the low affinity of
subcritical water for non-polar plastics [227]. In contrast, subcritical
water facilitates the favorable dissociation of functional linkages in
polar plastics (PC, PA6, PA66, PET, and PUR). The selective bond scis-
sion of polar plastics results in high yields of crude-like liquid (89 wt%
for PC, 62 wt% for PA6, 58 wt% for PA66, 27 wt% for PET, and 88 wt%
for PUR). The highest oil yields obtained from the HTL of plastics be-
tween 350 and 450
C under 25 MPa were as follows: 63 wt% for PC (at
425
C), and 15 wt
C), 33 wt% for PP (at 425
C) [228]. Despite achieving a PET conversion of >90
% for PET (at 450
wt%, the low yield of crude-like liquid is attributed to the formation of
terephthalic acid (TPA) monomer, which remains in the solid phase.

Supercritical liquefaction of PET was initiated at approximately
â¦
250
C under 1.5 MPa. The ester linkage in PET imparts great solubility
to subcritical water, leading to the production of monomeric products
such as TPA and EG Refs. [229,230]. O. Sato et al. [231] achieved the
highest yields of TPA (90 wt%) and EG (70 wt%) at 300
C, with the
C. The
lowest yields of TPA (80 wt%) and EG (10 wt%) observed at 420
significant decrease in the EG yield is attributed to supercritical water
catalyzing the intramolecular dehydration of polymeric linkages. The
use of base catalysts (such as NaOH and KOH) increase the TPA yield up
to 98 %, as obtained by HTL of PET at approximately 200

C [232].

â¦

â¦

â¦

Similar to PET, the carbonate linkage of PC is selectively degraded by
subcritical water [228,233,234]. The main component resulting from
hydrothermal treatment of PC is BPA with other phenolic compounds
(such as phenol and isopropyl phenol) since PC has the repeating
structure of bisphenol A (BPA) with a carbonate linkage [228]. There is a
90 wt% conversion of PC under subcritical water conditions (300
C and
7.9 MPa), with a BPA yield of 80.0 wt% [233]. Base catalysts (such as
KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3) were introduced to the liquefaction process to
expedite dissociation of the C-O bond in carbonate linkages [235]. For
example, KOH was used in the HTL of PC to obtain a liquid product yield
of 97.6 wt% that is higher than that of non-catalytic hydrothermal
conversion for PC (89.6 wt%) [227]. The yield of water-soluble con-
stituents increases from 15.9 wt% (non-catalytic) to 88.2 wt% (base--
catalyzed), indicating that further decomposition of the BPA monomer
occurs in the presence of KOH.

â¦

Hydrothermal processing of PE under supercritical water at 460
C
achieves 91.4 wt% yield of the liquid product [236]. A comparison of the
products produced from the pyrolysis and HTL of PE shows that the use
of supercritical water enhances the yield of liquid product and sup-
presses coke formation compared to the products produced from ther-
mal cracking [237]. Unlike similar product distribution for HCs (such as
alkanes and alkenes), HTL generates alcohol products. Alcohol pro-
duction results from the recombination between supercritical water and
the reactive intermediate products (such as C2âC4 light olefins)

Supercritical liquefaction of PP at 450

naphtha-ranged HCs in the liquid product was 88.0 wt%, which could
offer potential for use as gasoline blends. An increase in temperature of
sub- or supercritical water for PS liquefaction between 370 and 420
C
decreases the yields of styrene monomers, dimers, and trimers, and in-
creases the yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, and isopropyl benzene

functionality of supercritical toluene suppressing the secondary re-
actions of styrene.

Organic solvents including methanol [240â243], ethanol [244,245],
acetone [225], n-hexane [246], and ionic liquids [247] were used for the
hydrothermal treatment of plastic waste. For instance, a complete con-
â¦
version of PET was achieved at 330
C, yielding 70 wt% of DMT and 16
â¦
wt% of EG using supercritical methanol (Tc = 239.4
C and Pc = 8.09
MPa) [240]. Similarly, a 96.5 wt% recovery rate of DMT was obtained
using supercritical methanol [241]. The hydrothermal process of PET
using supercritical ethanol (243
C and 6.38 MPa) led to the formation of
different monomeric products such as diethyl terephthalate (DET); the
highest DET yield was 98.5 wt% [244]. Supercritical acetone (235
C
and 4.7 MPa) leads to the highest conversion of PE (75.3 wt%) and a
crude-like liquid yield of 39.3 wt%. through solvothermal degradation

presses undesirable side reactions to form oxygenated compounds

cyclohexanol
trans-
formation of PC in the presence of tetralin leads to a crude-like oil yield
of 62 wt% with a BPA yield of â¤5 wt% [247]. In contrast, the use of
cyclohexanol in this process results in a crude-like oil yield of 85.4 wt%
with a BPA yield of 53.2 wt%. The selective BPA production is attributed
to the intrinsic polarity of cyclohexanol facilitating the preferred
accessibility to the polar carbonate linkage in PC.

plastic wastes through gasification and hydrothermal
While gasification is resilient to the complex compositional matrices of
plastic waste, this practice remains dependent on syngas production
despite the varied structural characteristics of each constituent polymer.
Hydrothermal liquefaction produces a high yield of plastic-derived oil
under high-pressure conditions, but its suitability is restricted to specific
plastic types due to their interactions with sub- and super-critical water,
which exhibit distinct physico-chemical properties.

In contrast, pyrolysis is a non-oxidative thermal degradation process
conducted in an inert environment (N2, Ar, and He) that is widely used
to valorize plastic waste [249]. This method allows the transformation
of all carbon in plastics into three-phase pyrolytic products, including
gas, oil, and char [250]. Although the structural formations of plastic
wastes significantly influence the distribution of resulting pyrolytic
products, their carbon chain length and functional linkages can be
adjustable by manipulating various operating parameters, such as

16

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101219

temperature, heating rate, residence time, reaction medium, reactor
type, and the use of catalysts [251]. The selectivity toward desired
products is closely linked to the plastic waste-dependent pyrolytic
products and subsequent conversion processes. Based on this rationale,
the following subsections will focus on the valorization of the six major
types of plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PVC, and PET).

6.3.1. Pyrolysis mechanisms of plastic waste

â¦

The pyrolytic degradation behavior of plastics is influenced by their
specific chemical structures and can be measured through thermo-
gravimetric analysis (TGA) [252,253]. This analytical tool enables to
simulate the thermolytic behavior of plastics by monitoring their mass
change as the temperature increases in a controlled environment (Fig. 7)
[254]. To obtain the compositional matrices of plastic wastes, the
proximate and elemental analysis results from six-typed reference
polymers and associated plastic wastes are also summarized in Table S8.
As depicted in Fig. 7, HDPE, LDPE, PP, and PS exhibit similar TGA
indicating complete thermal degradation at temperatures
profiles,
below 500
C. The mass reduction of plastic waste is likely owing to the
release of volatile species resulting from the bond scissions of the
polymeric backbone, since they contain negligible amounts of fixed
carbon and ash (Fig. 7 and Table S8). However, the thermal degradation
rate differs between the different plastics. The thermal degradation rates
of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and PS are highest at 480, 475, 450, and 410
C,
respectively. The difference in thermal degradation rates is most likely
owing to the distinct chemical structures of the functional linkages
connected to the carbon-based backbone. The strength of the C-C bonds
present on the polymeric backbone depends on the chemical species of
the functional linkage [256]. The thermal degradation of polyolefins
such as HDPE, LDPE, PP, and PS occurs via free radical mechanisms
located at random and/or end positions in the polymer chain. Random
bond scission generates a wide range of HCs with a carbon number of
7â45 [257,258]. The carbon number distribution of the HCs shortens as
the reaction temperature increases. The product stream governed by end
chain scission mainly comprises of conjugated dienes and alkenes (with
a carbon number of 3â5). C3-C5 olefinic HCs exhibit reactivity by un-
dergoing oligomerization/cyclization via the Diels-Alder reaction at
temperatures â¥650
C, leading to the generation of aromatic HCs. Un-
like PE with the simplest chemical structure, hydrogen transfer to the
radical site is readily hampered when a larger molecular functional
linkage is present [259]. PP and PS comprise a carbon-based backbone
with methyl and phenyl linkages in repeating monomers. The phenyl
linkage allows tertiary carbon in the PS chain to be readily dissociated
by free radicals [260]. Thus, the temperature at which thermal degra-
dation of PS takes place is lower than that of PE and PP.

â¦

â¦

â¦

The thermal degradation patterns of PVC and PET are different from
those of the other four plastics. There are two noticeable mass reductions
in the TGA profile of PVC (Fig. 7 (e)). The thermal degradation of PVC
begins at 210
C which is lower than that of other plastics and is asso-
ciated with the presence of Cl in the PVC chain. The C-Cl bond (328 kJ
(cid:0) 1) in the PVC chain is more thermally labile than C-C bonds (348 kJ
mol
(cid:0) 1) considering their bond energies
(cid:0) 1) and C-H bonds (414 kJ mol
mol
[261]. Also, the first mass reduction (58 wt%) is in good agreement with
the mass content (56.4 wt%) of Cl in PVC (Table S8). During PVC
thermolysis, Cl readily abstracts hydrogen from the PVC backbone,
forming hydrogen chloride (HCl) [262]. Successive dehydrochlorination
results in the formation of unsaturated HCs (polyene) [263]. Thermal
degradation of the polyene is difficult to complete at â¥540
C, leaving
carbonaceous residue (Fig. 7 (e)). The mass of carbonaceous residue is
consistent with the fixed carbon content in PVC (Table S8). The unsat-
urated structure of the polyene is vulnerable to be recombined to
generate benzene derivatives. The benzene derivatives play a pivotal
role in forming charring material.

â¦

Thermal degradation of PET occurs from 320 to 500

C with a
distinctive degradation rate at 450
C (Fig. 7 (f)). PET undergoes a se-
lective cleavage of the ester linkage from the polymeric backbone. The

â¦

â¦

ester linkage is the most thermally unstable site in the PET backbone
owing to its unsymmetrical electron distribution [264]. Thus, the
considerable mass (81.8 wt%) of PET is liberated as a form of benzoic
acids and vinylic esters [265]. The final residual mass (13.9 wt%) is
similar with the fixed carbon content of PET (Table S8). The thermal
degradation rate of PET becomes slower at â¥500
C, continuing until
700
C. The delayed degradation is likely because PET includes a ben-
zene ring in its monomeric unit. The relatively high aromaticity of PET
provides a favorable condition to form charring material [266].

6.3.2. Effect of operating parameters on plastic waste pyrolysis

â¦

6.3.2.1. Temperature. Temperature is a critical parameter in the py-
rolysis of plastics, significantly influencing the product distribution and
composition. The thermal energy provided during pyrolysis must exceed
the bond enthalpies of the various chemical bonds present in the poly-
meric backbone of plastics (C-H, C-C, C-O, and so on) to induce bond
scission and initiate the degradation process [267]. The outcome of
pyrolysis is strongly correlated with the temperature employed in the
process. At higher temperatures (typically above 800
C) the pyrolysis
tends to favor the production of smaller molecular weight HCs such as
C2âC4 light olefins through free radical mechanisms [268]. However, the
presence of these light olefins in the pyrolytic products creates condi-
tions conducive to recombination. This recombination can lead to the
formation of aromatic compounds, often through reactions like the
Diels-Alder reaction and subsequent dehydrogenation [269]. The gen-
eration of aromatic compounds increases the likelihood of producing
PAHs, which are a group of organic compounds with multiple fused
aromatic rings. The precise control of the reaction temperature in the
pyrolysis process is essential to achieve the desired product distribution
and minimize the formation of unwanted by-products such as PAHs
[270]. Optimization of the pyrolysis conditions is necessary to enhance
the selectivity towards the target products and avoid undesirable re-
actions that may result in the formation of harmful or less valuable
compounds.

6.3.2.2. Heating rate. In addition to temperature, the heating rate plays
a crucial role in determining product distribution and selectivity.
Although the pyrogenic products sequentially evolved as the pyrolysis
temperature increased, a difference in the heating rates could alter the
degradation route. Pyrolysis commonly operates at flash, fast, or slow
heating rates. Flash/fast pyrolysis is conducted at heating rates of â¥1000
(cid:0) 1 [3]. A faster heating rate in the pyrolysis process
and 10â200
reaction favorably generates primary pyrogenic products with negligible
secondary reactions since the plastics quickly reach the high tempera-
ture [271]. This is probably since the thermal degradation of plastics is
inherently endothermic, whereas their secondary reactions are governed
by exothermic reactions [272]. Slow pyrolysis is carried out at a heating
(cid:0) 1 [273]. The slow heating rate delays the residence
rate of 0.1â10
time of the primary products in the pyrolysis reactor. Subsequently,
their recombination results in the formation of aromatic compounds.
Slow pyrolysis leads to a higher yield of solid product and lower yields of
gas and liquid [274,275].

6.3.2.3. Residence time of feedstock and pyrolytic volatiles. Residence
time serves as a key parameter in altering the product distribution in the
pyrolysis process for plastics. There are two different residence times
from the perspectives of plastic feedstock and volatile products liberated
from plastic pyrolysis. The residence time for plastic feedstock is asso-
ciated with the evolution of volatile pyrogenic products. An increase in
the feedstock residence time provides an opportunity for sufficient
conversion of plastics into primary pyrogenic products. Also, their
chemical composition becomes lighter with the longer residence time of
plastic feedstock.

Meanwhile, the residence time for volatile pyrogenic products

17

T. Lee et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101219

stemming from plastics is appropriately adjusted to obtain the desired
product distribution. The residence time of the volatile pyrogenic
products is typically â¤2 s, which is shortened by fast heating [276]. The
short residence time offers favorable conditions to suppress the sec-
ondary reactions of primary pyrogenic products. Thus, flash/fast py-
rolysis contributes to the high yield of plastic-derived oil. The vapor
residence time in the pyrolysis reactor can be prolonged by a slow
heating rate. The increase in residence time contributes to a shift in the
product distribution from large molecular HCs into smaller molecular
HCs. However, the surplus residence time allows the volatile products to
be additionally reacted. A series of secondary reactions (thermal
cracking, isomerization, aromatization, and dehydrogenation) modify
the compositional matrixes of pyrogenic products to generate aromatic
compounds and charring materials [277].

6.3.2.4. Reaction medium. In general, inert gases such as N2, He, and Ar
are employed to create an oxygen-free environment. The inert gases are
stable and non-reactive, which blocks oxidation of the pyrogenic prod-
ucts. Nitrogen is the most widely used in the pyrolysis process. Exerting
a vacuum can be commonly adopted when using a sealed pyrolysis
reactor. Despite the inertness of helium and argon, their practical use is
unfavorable owing to the relatively high price.

Besides the inert gases, selecting an appropriate reactive gas in the
pyrolysis process provides an opportunity to tailor the distribution of
pyrogenic products. Bond scission of the polymeric backbone in the
pyrolysis process is originally propagated by intramolecular hydrogen
transfer [278]. The use of hydrogen as a pyrolysis reactant could be a
promising route to lower the reaction temperature owing to its enhanced
mass transfer [279]. Indeed, hydropyrolysis facilitates the saturation of
double or triple bonds in thermolytic products [280]. Considering the
intrinsic reactivity of unsaturated bonds, their saturation by hydrogen
mitigates the aromatic formations governed from the unintended
recombination [281]. An increase in hydrogen pressure readily allows
hydrogen finishing of the unsaturated species [282]. Unfortunately, the
resulting products from hydropyrolysis comprise hydrocarbon mixtures
with a wide range of carbon numbers. Thus, hydropyrolysis is unsuitable
in narrowing the product distribution. Nevertheless, the use of H2 sup-
ported by acidic catalysts such as zeolites helps to narrow the carbon
length of saturated HCs and suppress catalyst deactivation caused by
coke formation [283].

Methane (CH4) could be an alternative option to provide a hydrogen

source to the pyrolysis process [284]. It possesses the highest H/C ratio
of all the HCs. The use of CH4 as the reaction medium in pyrolysis can
help feed H2 through CH4 decomposition (CH4 â C + 2H2). The for-
mation of H2 provided by CH4 follows the specific reaction route like the
hydropyrolysis. Accordingly, the production of saturated HCs is ex-
pected in the CH4-assisted pyrolysis process. In addition to H2 formation,
the dissociation of CH4 via free radical mechanism simultaneously
+
(y = 3 or 5)
generates methyl radicals such as CHx (x < 3) and C2Hy
[285]. The presence of these reactive intermediates could alter pyro-
genic product distribution by reacting with volatile products liberated
from plastic pyrolysis [286]. Indeed, their recombination offers a
favorable condition to form the aromatic compounds.

(cid:0) 1, which is thermodynamically activated at â¥700

Nevertheless, CH4 decomposition is technically challenging owing to
its stable and symmetric chemical structure consisting of four C-H co-
valent bonds [287]. This reaction is endothermic with ÎH0 = 75.6 kJ
mol
C [288]. Various
catalysts were adopted in the pyrolysis system to lower the temperature
initiating CH4 decomposition. The use of bifunctional catalysts
comprising of transition metals and zeolite supports is favored [287].
Transition metals activate CH4 for its decomposition, while zeolite
supports are responsible for narrowing the product distribution towards
monoaromatics such as BTEX [287].

â¦

CO2 can be used as reactive raw material to impart the green/sus-
tainable feature to the pyrolysis process. The use of CO2 offers a strategic
means to offset CO2 stemming from the combustion of fossil fuels. In the
thermo-chemical process, CO2 can participate in various reaction routes
such as the reverse water gas shift reaction (H2+CO2 â CO + H2O),
methane dry reforming (CH4+CO2 â 2CO+2H2), Boudouard reaction
(CO2+C(s) â 2CO), and others. Nevertheless, these reactions spontane-
ously occur at the gasification temperature regime of â¥700
C [289].
This fact cannot be fully explicable of the mechanistic role of CO2 in the
pyrolysis process since the volatilization of plastics is mostly completed
at â¤500

C.

A great deal of research has conducted the employment of CO2 as a
reaction medium in the range of pyrolysis temperature [290â294].
Characterizing the functionalities of CO2 with the volatile pyrogenic
products stemming from plastics is mainly discussed. To this end, it is
hypothesized that CO2 has a great potential to react with the volatiles via
the gas-phase reaction [295]. Indeed, CO2 allows the volatile pyrogenic
products to be converted into lighter molecular HCs. The partial
oxidation of CO2 on the volatile products simultaneously contributes to
the enhanced production of CO. The compositional modification of

pyrogenic products induced by CO2 is well supported by the distribution
of three-phase pyrogenic products (gas, oil, and char) [296]. Thus, the
mechanistic role of CO2 helps to divert the product distribution patterns,
resulting in the enhanced formation of gaseous products.

6.3.2.5. Using catalysts in plastic waste pyrolysis. Catalysts are exten-
sively adopted in the thermo-chemical platform thanks to its inherent
acidity and texture properties [297â299]. Thus, screening an appro-
priate catalyst is of significance to narrow the product distribution for
the desired products [300â302]. The representative catalyst species,
which are efficient for the pyrolytic valorization of plastic waste, their
detailed information including catalyst characteristics, reaction mech-
anism, and product selectivity, is summarized in Table 6. Also, the case
study results supporting these performances are provided in Table S9.
In the pyrolysis process for plastics, zeolite catalysts are widely
adopted to adjust the carbon length and aromaticity owing to their acid
strength and shape selectivity [303,304], enabling to improve target
product selectivity. Typical examples include zeolite socony mobil-5
(ZSM-5), beta, and Y [305â309]. The formation of light molecular HCs
is favored in the order of ZSM-5, beta, and Y (Fig. 8 (a)) in the catalytic
pyrolysis for polyolefins (such as HDPE, LDPE, and PP) [308,310,311].
ZSM-5 has the strongest acidity; therefore, it provides a favorable con-
dition to produce C2âC4 olefinic HCs (Fig. 8 (b)) [312]. Simultaneously,
the light olefins could be readily recombined to form aromatic com-
pounds, while their product distribution is not selective [305,312]. This
implies that the catalytic reaction is activated at the external surface of

zeolite. Considering that
the thermolysis of polyolefins liberates
long-chained HCs, their entrance through the narrow pores of ZSM-5 can
be sterically hindered. In contrast, zeolite Y and zeolite beta have larger
pore sizes compared with ZSM-5. This offers an opportunity to enhance
the diffusion of relatively larger volatile products to the internal active
sites of Y and beta zeolites. Also, their weaker acid density favorably
leads to product distribution towards C5âC11 HCs (Fig. 8 (b)). Never-
theless, the average pore size of zeolites is inherently small (equivalent
to â¤10 Ã). The bulky volatile molecules liberated from plastic pyrolysis
still suffer from a difficulty to diffuse into internal active sites of zeolites.
This is deemed the major constraint to lower product selectivity in the
catalytic pyrolysis of plastics.

ZSM-5 and ultrastable Y (USY) zeolites show product selectivity for
light molecular HCs with the carbon number of â¤9, resulting in yields of
88.3 and 85.6 wt% in the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes comprising
PE (62.0 wt%), PP (34.0 wt%), PVC (3.0 wt%), PS (1.0 wt%) [317].
Nevertheless, the generation of gasoline ranged HCs using USY (48.4 wt
% of C5âC9) is larger than that using ZSM-5 (34.5 wt%). ZSM-5 shows a
greater generation of gaseous products. A difference in the selectivity
towards gasoline ranged HCs is likely attributed to the weaker acid-
ity/larger pore diameter of USY over ZSM-5. Similarly, ZSM-5 shows
superior selectivity of gaseous products (74 wt%. of C2âC4, while C5âC11
ranged HCs were equivalent to 25 wt%) compared to the distribution of
plastic-derived pyrogenic products using beta, and Y zeolite [318]. The
product yields of C2âC4 HCs, C5âC11 HCs, and C12âC20 HCs over beta
zeolite were 48.0, 46.0, and 4.0 wt%, respectively. Meanwhile, catalytic

19

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101219

pyrolysis over Y zeolite contributed to 36 wt% of C2âC4 HCs, 64 wt% of
C5âC11 HCs, and 10 wt% of C12âC20 HCs. The difference in the product
distribution shows the characteristic features of three zeolites. The
strongest acidity of ZSM-5 expedited the thermal cracking of polymeric
backbone into the gaseous products, while Y zeolite was effective in the
production of gasoline ranged HCs (C5-C11). These experimental results
have the great coincidence with the denoted explanation on the overall
characteristics of zeolite catalysts.

Aluminosilicates such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 offer an alternative
strategy owing to their mesoporous pore size (1.5â30 nm) over zeolites
[319]. They enable the larger volatile molecules to be diffused into the
internal active sites. Their high surface area provides high acid density
per unit mass of reactants. Although the acidity of the aluminosilicates is
much weaker than zeolites, the improved mass transfer of larger volatile
molecules leads to higher selectivity on gasoline ranged HCs [320].
Nevertheless, aluminosilicates have technical demerits in the shape
selectivity and catalyst lifetime [321]. Unlike zeolite catalysts, alumi-
nosilicates are only effective in shortening the carbon length of volatile
pyrogenic products owing to the absence of shape selectivity [319,322].
As such, narrowing the product distribution using aluminosilicates
cannot be readily realized. Also, their large pore size is more susceptible
to deposit coke on the catalyst surface, posing a rapid deactivation and
short service life.

Catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins (consisting of 55 wt% of PE and 45
wt% of PP) using Al-SBA-15 catalyst yielded 89.1 wt% of an oil product
compared with 41.5 wt% using ZSM-5 [323]. Compositional analysis of
the oils identified that the use of Al-SBA-15 resulted in 53.5 area% for
C13âC20 HCs, while the use of ZSM-5 led to 22.2 area% of C13âC20 HCs.
The product selectivity for C13âC20 HCs is likely owing to the larger pore
size of Al-SBA-15 facilitating the improved accessibility of bulk molec-
ular volatiles into the internal acid sites. Product distribution from the
catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE when adopting ZSM-5 and MCM-41 catalyst
shows that the thermal degradation of LDPE is significantly expedited
over ZSM-5, resulting in 73.5 wt% of gaseous products (comprising
C1âC4 HCs) and 16.5 wt% of liquid products (comprising C5âC12 HCs)
[324]. Meanwhile, the employment of Al-MCM-41 catalyst noticeable
increases the liquid products corresponding to 33.7 wt%. These results
are strongly associated with weaker acidity and larger pore structure of
the aluminosilicates compared with zeolite.

Impregnation of transition metals to the zeolites additionally cata-
lyzes the C-H activation owing to their affinity for hydrogen [325]. The
impregnation of metals (such as Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, Ni, Fe, Co, and Cu) on the
zeolite could be a strategic approach to minutely tune acidity and pore
structure of the catalysts. Zeolite acidity serves a role in C-C bond
cleavage. Simultaneously, the use of transition metals imparts an affinity
of the C-H bonds by governing hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
Therefore, bifunctional catalysts provide a catalytic activity in the hy-
drocracking of polyolefins. For example, C-H activation of reactants on
metal catalysts undergoes dehydrogenation. The intermediates diffuse
into the BrÃ¸nsted acid sites of zeolite, thereby resulting in C-C bond
cleavage and subsequent isomerization. The cracked/isomeric products
diffuse back to the metal sites for hydrogenation resulting in a series of
hydrocracking
terminated by forming
short-chained products (Fig. 8 (c)).

Impregnation of Ru metal on the Y zeolite support (1 wt% Ru/Y
zeolite) in the pyrolysis of HDPE increases the yield of gaseous products
by 1.2 times, equivalent to 42 wt% [326]. Simultaneously, the Ru/Y
zeolite enhances the generation of aromatic compounds, leading to 94.4
area% in pyrogenic oil. The introduction of transition metals on the
zeolite leads to increased selectivity for aromatic HCs. This is likely
attributed to complex catalytic reactions inducing isomerization, olig-
omerization, cyclization, aromatization, and cracking [327,328]. The
addition of Fe to zeolite support (5 wt% Fe/ZSM-5) for catalytic pyrol-
ysis of plastic waste (mixture of LDPE, HDPE, and PP) intensifies the
catalytic capability for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation leading to an
increase in the liquid yield (76.0 wt%) compared to 60 wt% from ZSM-5

20

[329]. The liquid pyrogenic products include 66 wt% of C6âC20 satu-
rated HCs. Pyrogenic oil can be used for commercial diesel fuel
considering the narrow product distribution.

Unlike the hydrocracking reaction, the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins
can be catalyzed by metal sites [330,331]. The metal sites serve as
promoters to activate C-H bonds and crack C-C bonds. For instance, the
metal sites allow polyolefins to be processed through dehydrogenation,
forming the intermediate olefins. Their cleavage of C-C bonds shortens
the carbon length of polymer chains. Subsequently, the short-chained
unsaturated species can be hydrogenated at the same metal sites. The
resulting products mainly comprise of linear alkanes with no isomeric
products. This is reasonable since the metal active sites cannot provide
shape selectivity (Fig. 8 (d)).

A Ni-based catalyst (5 wt% Ni/SiO2) for the hydrogenolysis of LDPE
shows high selectivity (76.1 wt%) with the liquid products comprising
C4âC22 n-alkanes [332]. This likely results from the catalytic ability of Ni
catalyst for C-H and C-C bond scissions. Specifically, the long-chained
carbon backbone in LDPE can be shortened by Ni catalyst, forming
alkyl intermediates. Subsequently, the Ni catalyst facilitates saturation
of the intermediates by activating hydrogen. Meanwhile, hydrogenolysis
of LDPE over 5 wt% Ru/CeO2 catalyst results in 84.0 wt% of the liquid
products mainly consisting of C4âC21 HCs [333]. The selectivity towards
the diesel ranged HCs (a carbon number between 11 and 21) in the
pyrogenic oil was 74 %. The hydrogenation of pyrogenic products
stemming from LDPE is likely supported by CeO2. The weak Lewis acid
site of CeO2 (basic metal oxide) helps to narrow the product distribution
for the diesel-range alkanes without isomerization.

The use of metals and metal oxides in the pyrolysis process for
plastics could be a promising option owing to their affordable price and
abundance in nature [334]. Metal oxides have an intrinsic basicity based
on their multivalent nature and acid-base characteristic [335]. The ba-
sicity of metal oxides is determined by the size of cations and oxide ions
[336]. The interaction with oxide ions becomes stronger when the
cation size decreases owing to their enhanced electronegativity [337].
An increase in the size of oxide ions enables it to easily accept a proton.
Various metal oxides (CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, ZnO, and others) were used as
the basic catalysts in the thermo-chemical process for plastics [338,
339]. Their basicity is strong in the following order of CaO, MgO, Fe2O3,
and ZnO [338,340â342]. The strongest basicity of CaO exhibits superior
deoxygenation compared to that of the other metal oxides. In addition to
deoxygenation, catalytic cracking of the polymer chain over the base
catalysts can be promoted through carbanion mechanisms. Transfer of a
proton into the metal oxides allows the formation of carbanions on the
polymer chains. The unstable carbanions catalyze the subsequent
beta-scission, thereby generating light molecular HCs [343]. Recombi-
nation of light HCs induced by dehydrogenation and subsequent cycli-
zation leads to the production of aromatic compounds [344].

â¦

C, although an increase in the reaction temperature up to 470

MgO could serve as a base catalyst owing to the presence of Lewis
acid site in the catalytic pyrolysis of PE-derived wax co-feeding with
MgO [345]. The mesoporous structure of MgO allows the long-chained
volatile HCs to be catalyzed. The expedited thermal cracking of PE-wax
leads to a shift in the product distribution towards pyrogenic oil. The
effectiveness of MgO to produce diesel-ranged HCs is significant at
420
C
leads to product selectivity for lighter molecular HCs, and their product
yield is considerably lowered. Simultaneously, the enhanced formation
of gaseous product was identified. BaO catalyst shows superior perfor-
mance in recovering styrene monomer following PS pyrolysis compared
with K2O, CaO, MgO, and Na2O [346]. This is likely owing to BaO
exhibiting the strongest basicity which facilitates the formation of
carbanions on the PS chain. Consequently, the selective dissociation of
PS imparted by BaO catalyst leads to the highest yield of pyrogenic oil
(93.4 wt%) and product selectivity for styrene monomer (76.4 wt%).
Most recently, an ultrahigh-porous MgO was used to treat non-woven
polyester fabric debris via pyrolysis, which led to high selectivity to-
ward esters and low selectivity toward benzoic and phthalic acids owing

â¦

to enhanced decarboxylation and esterification reactions [347].

Natural minerals offer an alternative option as a catalyst for the
conversion of plastics. The catalytic capability of minerals is derived
from its intrinsic texture structure and inorganic contents [348â350].
Furthermore, the addition of transition metals facilitates the modifica-
tion of their surface properties and acid strength. Fe/bentonite exhibits
the highest oil yield (79.3 wt%) for the pyrolysis of mixed plastics
showing the 80.5 area% of diesel-ranged HCs compared with bentonite
clay intercalated with Fe, Zr, Al, and Ti [350]. Meanwhile, the product
selectivity for gasoline-ranged HCs (28.0 area%) and diesel-ranged HCs
(62.3 area%) was identified when using Ti/bentonite. The difference in
the product selectivity likely stems from the functionalities of transition
metals impregnated in bentonite.

Given that industrial wastes possess various metal oxides, they could
be a promising source for use as a base catalyst for pyrolysis. Red mud is
a by-product of the Bayer process of aluminum production [351]. It
comprises Fe2O3 (36.5 wt%), Al2O3 (23.8 wt%), TiO2 (13.5 wt%), SiO2
(8.5 wt%), CaO (5.3 wt%), and others. Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic
wastes using red mud mainly generates C19 HCs [352]. The use of red
mud helps to shorten the carbon length of liquid products into C7âC16
HCs. The catalytic reaction is associated with the acid sites imparted by
Al2O3 and SiO2 in red mud. The presence of Fe2O3 and TiO2 additionally
promote hydrogenation and hydrocracking of plastic waste.

6.3.2.6. Types of pyrolizers used for plastic waste. A pyrolysis reactor for
plastic waste should be designed to improve heat transfer and guarantee
a reliable temperature control [353]. It is important to properly control
the diffusion between catalysts and volatile compounds generated from
the pyrolysis reactors to improve catalytic efficiency [258]. In this
context, the influence of reactor design on product distribution is
discussed.

A batch reactor consists of a sealed vessel and a mechanical stirrer
[354]. The reactor is typically operated at high temperature and pres-
sure [355,356]. This reactor has an advantage of simple operation,
compact size, and high efficiency. However, the volatile compounds
evolved from plastics stay in the closed reactor system for a long period
of time; hence, the reactor pressure can unexpectedly increase by the
volatiles. This may lead to the undesired recombination of volatiles. To
cope with this, a semi/continuous flow batch reactor introduces the
inflow of reactants and the outflow of products [37,258]. The release of
volatile products evolved in the pyrolysis reactor lowers the vapor
residence time and the reactor pressure; thus, this reactor helps suppress
the secondary reactions of primary pyrogenic products. Nevertheless, a
technical difficulty in the instant release of volatiles evolved in the batch
reactor system is perceived as the major hindrance in obtaining the
desired products.

A rotary kiln reactor injects carbonaceous materials (such as coal,
biomass, and plastics) into a rotating tube reactor [357]. Rotation of the
pyrolysis reactor enables the feedstocks to be well mixed, contributing to
improved heat transfer. A great deal of industrial applications have been
made thanks to the low capital/operation cost [258]. Unlike other
feedstocks, plastics are melted at the beginning of the pyrolysis process.
The melted plastics are located on the bottom of the rotary reactor. The
melted plastic is susceptible to uneven thermal transfer. As such, the
volatilization of plastics cannot be readily realized. Moreover, a thermal
gradient from the reactor walls to the center poses considerable delay in
the heat transfer to the volatiles liberated from plastics [358]. Thus, the
retarded heat transfer for the volatiles favorably causes secondary re-
actions. A screw feed reactor was developed by establishing a screw in
the rotary kiln reactor. This reactor has the advantage of easy control of
various operating parameters (temperature, residence time, mechanical
mixing, and so on) by manipulating the rotating rate of the screw [359].
The screw can be also used as a heat source. A heat supply by the screw
helps provide uniform heat transfer to this reactor. Despite the technical
benefits of this pyrolysis reactor, the high molecular pyrogenic products

stemming from plastics are sticky. Their inherent nature gives rise to
prolong the residence time of the pyrogenic products in the reactor. As
such, the production of target products could be readily hampered by
undesired secondary reactions. This fact is deemed the main constraint
to restrict the practical application of this pyrolysis reactor.

In a fixed-bed pyrolizer, catalyst configuration was important to
modify pyrolytic product distribution [360]. In-situ and ex-situ catalyst
configurations were prepared for the catalytic pyrolysis of banner waste
(mainly comprising polyester) using cobalt oxides (Co3O4) [361]. The
in-situ configuration facilitates the diffusion of pyrolytic vapors to cat-
alytic sites, resulting in more production of pyrolytic gas and less for-
mation of solid residue (char) than the ex-situ configuration. Also, the
difference in catalyst configuration alters the degradation mechanism
for the ester linkage. The effectiveness of cobalt oxides to promote
decarboxylation and suppress decarbonylation was strengthened by the
ex-situ configuration.

A fluidized bed reactor operates under the fluidization of catalysts
and plastic feeds. Their well-mixture in the stable fluidized bed helps
improve heat/mass transfer. Consequently, the enhanced reaction ki-
netics for the catalytic process contribute to better selectivity for the
target pyrogenic products. The lifespan of catalysts can be prolonged
owing to lower formation of coke. However, the cylindrical reactor
inevitably incurs the turbulent stream of fluidizing reagents, partially
restricting mass transfer. Agglomeration induced by the sticky fluidizing
reagents causes bed defluidization [362]. These technical problems alter
the desired degradation route for plastics, disturbing the production of
target pyrogenic products. To cope with this, a conical spouted bed
reactor was developed by modifying the reactor shape into a cone.
Consequently, improved movement of the fluidizing reagents results in
enhanced heat/mass transfer, enabling the fine-tuning of a quality of
pyrolytic product.

6.4. Recovery of monomers

Plastics are high molecular weight products consisting of repeating
units (monomers). Recovery of monomers from plastic waste offers an
opportunity to realize a circular economy through re-use of the recov-
ered monomers in the manufacture of virgin plastics [363â365].
Recovering the monomeric compounds by thermo-chemical processes is
effective for PS, PMMA, PET, PA, and PC. Furthermore, PS and PMMA
can be transformed into their monomers with high selectivity [78]. In
contrast, condensation polymers (including PET, PA, and PC) require
reactive agents (such as H2O and H2) to obtain the component mono-
mers [366]. High purity of a monomer in the product stream should be
guaranteed to facilitate re-polymerization of the recovered monomers.
Thus, establishing the reliable thermo-chemical conversion of plastic
waste is desirable to obtain monomers with high selectivity. Following
subsections describes case studies for the valorization of various plastics
into corresponding monomers, as summarized in Table S10.

6.4.1. Styrene from PS

PS comprises a carbon-based backbone with the phenyl linkages in
every repeating unit. The phenyl linkage may allow PS to be selectively
depolymerized to styrene (Section 6.3.1). However, the pyrolysis of PS
experiences various degradation reactions
(intra-/inter-molecular
hydrogen abstraction and subsequent beta-scission); thus, secondary
reactions generate aromatic compounds (such as BTEX) to lower the
selectivity of styrene. Acid and base catalysts enhance styrene selec-
tivity. Base catalysts deprotonate the polymeric backbone in PS, creating
carbanions
the
beta-scission to produce styrene. In contrast, acid catalysts protonate
phenyl linkages, forming carbocations [368]. The product distribution
obtained from acid catalyzed pyrolysis is contingent on the position of
the carbocations. Thus, a base catalyst offers a higher selectivity of
styrene than an acid catalyst [369].

of 61.7 wt% at 350
C, which is much higher than the yield obtained
with Al2O3 (20.7 wt%) [370]. Meanwhile, a bifunctional acid/base
catalyst (K-Fe/Î³-Al2O3) produces styrene from PS at 375
C [371]. The
acid sites of Î³-Al2O3 enhance C-C bond cleavage, the base sites of K
deprotonate the tertiary carbon in the PS backbone, and Fe enhances the
adsorption of phenyl linkages in PS [372]. The use of K-Fe/Î³-Al2O3 re-
sults in an 83.2 wt% styrene.

â¦

6.4.2. Methyl methacrylate from PMMA

MMA is the monomer of PMMA [373,374]. Thermal degradation of
PMMA occurs via free radical mechanisms. The free radicals are pref-
erentially propagated to carbon located at the beta position owing to
electronic and steric hindrance imparted by MMA. Thus, selective C-C
bond scission in the PMMA backbone results in MMA monomer as the
main product [375]. PMMA pyrolysis between 350 and 600
C in a batch
reactor gave the high selectivity of MMA [376]. An increase in the
C increases the pyrolysis oil yield from
temperature from 350 to 600
59.0 to 86.0 wt% but decreases the MMA selectivity from 94.9 to 92.5 wt
%. Although the thermal degradation of PMMA is completed at â¤450
C,
600
C produces the highest pyrolysis oil yield [377]. This is attributed
to the difficulty in controlling heat and mass transfer in the batch
reactor.

Selection of an appropriate reactor system to ensure heat and mass
transfer is important to finely control the reaction temperature [378,
379]. A fluidized-bed pyrolizer recovered 98.5 wt% MMA from PMMA
at 450
C, with a high selectivity for MMA (98.7 wt%), resulting from the
improved heat/mass transfer of the fluidized bed reactor over the batch
reactor [374]. The application of a conical spouted bed reactor for
PMMA pyrolysis allowed a precise control of vapor residence time,
thereby suppressing the secondary reactions of volatiles to yield 86.5 wt
% MMA with 87.3 wt% MMA selectivity at 400

C [380].

6.4.3. Terephthalic acid from PET

PET is synthesized under polycondensation of TPA and EG; thus,
thermal treatment of PET provides an opportunity to recover TPA and
EG Ref. [381] owing to lower dissociation energy of C-O bond in ester
linkage than that of C-H and C-C bonds. Reactive agents such as steam
and H2 were used in the pyrolysis of PET to enhance the recovery of TPA
monomer [382,383]. Pyrolysis of PET in the presence of steam at
320â440
C increases the volumetric fraction of steam from 0 to 75 vol%
C [384]. This is
and increases the TPA recovery yield to 78 wt% at 400
likely owing to the steam catalyzing nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl
carbon in the PET backbone. However, steam-assisted pyrolysis for PET
requires long residence time owing to low accessibility of steam on the
PET matrix.

â¦

â¦

The selective production of TPA from PET is hindered by the for-
mation of vinyl ester intermediates [384]. H2 offers a favorable condi-
tion with the vinyl esters hydrocracked into TPA and ethylene. A
bifunctional catalyst (10 wt% MoO2/AC) for the hydrocracking of PET
yielded a maximum of 36.7 wt% TPA at 400
C with a selectivity of 70.3
wt% [383]. The MoO2/AC catalyst allows selective C-O bond scission of
the vinyl ester intermediates and subsequent hydrogenation, increasing
the TPA selectivity with the formation of ethylene.

6.4.4. Caprolactam from polyamide 6

PA6 is synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of caprolactam.
Thermo-chemical conversion of PA6 is effective in recovering capro-
lactam [385â388]. Thermal degradation of PA6 via random bond scis-
sion (cis-elimination) could produce caprolactam [389,390]. Base
catalyzed (NaOH and KOH) pyrolysis of PA6 achieves 98.4 wt%
caprolactam selectivity at 290
C [390]. Deprotonating nitrogen in
amide linkage and subsequent intermolecular cyclization is promoted by
the base catalyst. Czernik et al. [391] tested the performance of

heterogeneous catalyst (Al2O3) in the caprolactam recovery. The 5 wt%
KOH activation to Al2O3 imparted a hydroxyl site on the catalyst surface.
The use of KOH/Al2O3 yielded 85.6 wt% caprolactam at 330

C.

6.4.5. Bisphenol A from PC

â¦

PC contains polymers of carbonate linkages in their repeating
chemical structure using BPA as a component monomer. The thermal
cracking of carbonate linkages present on PC is sensitive to temperature
[392]. Pyrolysis of compact disc produces 52 wt% liquid PC with a BPA
selectivity of 40.1 wt% at 600
C [393]. The low selectivity for a BPA
monomer was attibuted to the complex degradation patterns of PC. The
C-C bond scission of isopropylidenes in PC enhances the formation of
gaseous products (mainly CH4) [392], and the recombination of car-
bonate linkages produces high molecular weight products that serve as a
precusor to form char [394]. Steam-assisted pyrolysis at 300 and 500
C
in the presence of MgO base catalysts produces 70 wt% BPA with a
selectivity of â¥90 wt% [395] attributed to the base catalyst acting as the
nucleophile selectively attacking the C-O bonds in carbonate linkages.
Similarly, the base species present in a MSW incinerator bottom
ash-derived catalyst enhanced the production of BPA from PC feedstock
[396].

â¦

6.4.6. Lactic acid/lactide from PLA

â¦

PLA is synthesized under polycondensation of lactic acid or ring-
opening polymerization of lactide. Lactic acid with a liquid yield of
81 wt% was produced from PLA straw using sea shell-derived catalyst
(mass ratio of catalyst to PLA: 0.1) at 500
C which was higher than the
yield obtained by non-catalytic pyrolysis (66.3 wt%) [397]. The recov-
ery yield of lactic acid (12 wt%) was increased 1.34 times by increasing
the catalyst/PLA ratio up to 0.5. Pyrolysis of PLA at 400
C leads to a
liquid yield of 72.8 wt% with lactide selectivity of 58.5 area% [398].
Zeolite significantly increased the lactide selectivity (78.9 area%), while
MgO catalyst was not effective at the selective production of lactide. The
L-lactide selectivity obtained from the co-pyrolysis of PLA and lignin
was 23.2 area% compared to 8.7 area% from the pyrolysis of PLA alone
[399]. This indicates that the addition of lignin to PLA pyrolysis sup-
presses transesterification while promoting free radical reactions.

â¦

â¦

â¦

The conversion of PLA into lactic acid by the introduction of CO2 as a
reactive gas to the pyrolysis reaction preferably occurs at â¥600
C
[400]. CO2 alters the degradation route for recovering lactic acid from
PLA. The CO2-assisted pyrolysis of PLA at 800
C results in a lactic acid
yield of 17.6 wt%, which is a 4.63-fold increase compared with the N2
environment. This suggests that CO2 facilitates the selective dissociation
of ester linkage in PLA. A similar pattern was observed with a catalyst
derived from MSW incinerator bottom ash [401]. Tricalcium phosphate
(TCP; Ca3P2O8) has high thermal stability and catalytic activity for
transesterification. Catalytic pyrolysis of PLA using CO2 and TCP cata-
lyst at 500
C results in a liquid yield of 77.1 wt% and lactic acid
selectivity of 21 wt% [402]. The use of TCP catalyst leads to a three-fold
higher yield of lactic acid than that of non-catalytic pyrolysis. This was
likely because the improved accessibility of CO2 to the PLA backbone
promotes the acid-catalyzed hydrogen transfer reaction.

6.5. Recovery of aromatics

Among various aromatic products, BTEX are widely adopted as the
initial feedstocks owing to their commercial applications in the petro-
chemical industries. Global market demand for BTEX in 2022 was 6.7
billion USD, and is expected to reach 9.1 billion USD by 2028 [403].
reforming of
BTEX are
fossil-derived naphtha (see Section 3.1.2.) [404], accounting for â¥80 %
of the global BTEX production [405]. Therefore, recycling plastic waste
into BTEX provides a promising way to reduce current high dependences
on petroleum. A variety of approaches for the BTEX production from
pyrolytic valorization platform are presented in Table S11.

6.5.1. Aromatics from polyolefins

â¦

Catalysts were introduced in the pyrolysis process to valorize PE/PP
and obtain high-purity BTEX to help narrow the product distribution at
â¤650
C. Thus, screening a suitable catalyst to obtain the high yield of
BTEX is of significance. Zeolites were preferably used to convert PE/PP
into BTEX owing to their strong acid strength and shape selectivity.
Inayat et al. [406] prepared HZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratios of 12, 19,
or 108 in the pyrolysis process of LDPE. The use of HZSM-5 (with the
catalyst-to-feed mass ratio of 0.1) significantly reduces the liquid yield
(81.5 wt%) compared to that from thermal pyrolysis. An increase of the
Si/Al ratio in HZSM-5 leads to a liquid yield of 39.5â45.8 wt% but en-
hances the selectivity for BTEX formation. This is attributed to an in-
crease of BrÃ¸nsted acid sites in HZSM-5. The BrÃ¸nsted acid sites are
responsible for the aromatization of pyrolytic volatiles. Catalytic py-
rolysis of LDPE using MCM-41 catalyst containing large pore sizes and
low acid density leads to its conversion into a broad distribution of
aliphatic HCs [407]. The use of HÎ² and HY catalysts instead of MCM-41
shows higher product selectivity for alkylbenzene derivatives rather
than BTEX. The pyrolysis of LDPE catalyzed by HZSM-5 results in a
noticeable increase of BTEX formations. This is attributed to the intrinsic
shape selectivity of HZSM-5 to hinder the growth of side chains to a
benzene ring. Indeed, the size of micropores in HZSM-5 is comparable to
that of the benzene ring. Moreover, the distribution of acid sites in
HZSM-5 affects product selectivity. An increasing concentration ratio of
BrÃ¸nsted acid site to Lewis acid site (i.e., [B]/[L]) in zeolites promotes
isomerization and/or aromatization of volatiles with enhanced selec-
tivity for BTEX (Fig. 9 (a)).

1-octene is a representative pyrolytic molecule that evolved from PE.
Catalytic pyrolysis of octene at a short contact time (â¤90 ms) discharges
C4-C5 olefins as the primary products (Fig. 9 (b)) [408]. Further cracking
increases the formation of ethylene and propylene. Subsequently, the
recombination of C2âC3 olefins creates BTX formations with increasing
catalyst contact time. The use of Hbeta zeolite yields 49.4 area% of BTEX
in pyrolytic oil during the catalytic pyrolysis of waste face mask mainly
comprising PP, while the selectivity for BTEX catalyzed by HZSM-5
zeolite was much lower (21 area%) [410]. This is owing to the stron-
ger diffusional hindrance of HZSM-5 to the branched HCs stemming
from PP.

Configuration of catalysts in the experimental setup facilitates the
concentrated production of BTEX. Three different catalyst contacting
modes (such as ex-situ, in-situ, and in-situ/sequential ex-situ catalysis)
were established in the semi-batch reactor to maximize BTX production
[411]. The thermolysis of PE yields 6.5 wt% of BTX using ZSM-5 cata-
lyst. In-situ and consecutive ex-situ arrangement of catalysts for PE
conversion show the superior capabilities for the yield of BTX (35.1 wt
%) over the results from ex-situ (10.9 wt%) or in-situ (25.9 wt%) con-
figurations. In similar experimental setups, designing tandem catalysis
using mesoporous and microporous catalysts also helps to improve the
mass transfer of volatiles to internal active sites. Thus, enhanced pro-
ductivity for BTEX can be expected. Wang et al. [409] stationarily placed
mesoporous MCM-41 and microporous HZSM-5 in the pyrolysis of
packaging waste (comprising PE (50 wt%), PP (30 wt%), and PS (20 wt
%)). The BTEX formation of 24.5 wt% was obtained when in-situ
MCM-41 was sequentially coupled with ex-situ HZSM-5, compared to
20.9 wt% from ex-situ catalysis of MCM-41/HZSM-5 (Fig. 9 (c)). In-situ
catalytic cracking of MCM-41 alters the product distribution towards C8
HCs. Their improved accessibility to internal acid sites of HZSM-5 results
in a high yield of BTEX. Also, the use of MCM-41/HZSM-5 catalyst under
an ex-situ catalysis system shows the considerable formation of coke
(15.6 wt%). In contrast, the tandem catalysis design leads to the sig-
nificant reduction of coke formation into less than 1.5 wt%.

6.5.2. Aromatics from polyesters

PET is a representative polyester offering a favorable condition to
produce the BTEX from pyrolysis since it has a benzene ring in the
repeating monomer. Given the resonance structure of benzene, thermal

T. Lee et al.

â¦

degradation of PET tends to occur at the ester linkages. Thus, selective
dissociation of the ester linkages present in PET increases the likelihood
of producing the desired BTEX. To this end, many studies have tried to
use the metal oxides as catalytic materials owing to their great activity
for oxygen transfer. The effectiveness of CaO on BTEX production in the
two-step catalytic pyrolysis of PET was performed using CaO catalysts
containing four different base strengths [412]. The primary pyrolytic
products from thermolysis of PET at 450
C mainly contain benzoic acid
and TPA. The use of CaO enables the catalytic conversion of these in-
termediate products into BTEX. An increase in the base strength of CaO
facilitates the decarboxylation of ester linkages. Indeed, the production
of BTEX catalyzed by CaO (having the highest base site density of 315
(cid:0) 1) increases by â¥ 7 times compared to the non-catalytic reaction
Î¼mol g
(8.6 area%). The CaO catalyst led to a noticeable selectivity for benzene
(63.0 area%). The same authors also performed catalytic pyrolysis of
PET over different metal oxides (ZnO, MgO, TiO2, and ZrO2) under
identical catalytic pyrolysis setups [413]. Compositional distribution of
BTEX is contingent on the acid-base properties of the metal oxides. The
ZnO catalyst has the strongest base strength and promotes the decar-
boxylation of volatiles stemming from PET. Thus, the highest yield of
benzene-rich aromatic HCs (particularly 73.3 area% of benzene) was
identified.

6.5.3. Aromatics from polycarbonates

Given the inherent high aromaticity of PC containing two benzene
rings in a single monomer, the thermal degradation of PC has great
potential for BTEX production. Nevertheless, the phenolic compounds
are the main product stream from PC pyrolysis. Thus, removing the
hydroxyl groups from the phenolic compounds is the main reaction
pathway to obtain the formation of BTEX. The effectiveness of co-
feeding other plastics (PE, PP, and PS) as a hydrogen donor in the cat-
alytic pyrolysis of PC shows that the use of HZSM-5 leads to 5 times
increased selectivity for BTEX formations (17.2 area%) over the results
â¦
from non-catalytic pyrolysis at 700
C [414] with PS serving as the most
effective hydrogen donor with ~2.5 times increase of the BTEX selec-
tivity (47 area%). The improved hydrogen transfer imparted by the

addition of PS facilitates increased production of BTEX. Catalytic con-
version of aromatic plastic mixtures (containing PC) over Ru/Nb2O5
catalyst yields 60.5 wt% BTEX with a selectivity of 49.4 wt% [415]. This
is likely owing to the characteristic properties of Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst
enabling the strong oxygen affinity of ester and ether linkages in the
aromatic plastics. Simultaneously, selective cleavage of C-C bonds is
processed by the BrÃ¸nsted acid sites. Despite the preferential activation
of transition metal for the C-H bonds, Ru particles disturb an adsorption
of aromatic compounds owing to its low coordination number, thereby
suppressing hydrogenation of the benzene ring.

6.5.4. Aromatics from elastomers

the chemical structure of

Elastomers are a polymer group with rubbery properties. Poly-
isoprene, polybutadiene, polystyrene-butadiene are deemed the repre-
sentative elastomers. Given that
three
elastomers contains a conjugated bond and/or a benzene ring, their
thermal degradation offers a favorable condition to produce aromatic
formations. A comparison of the thermolytic products obtained from the
thermolysis of three elastomers confirmed that polyisoprene is the main
component in tire waste [416]. The higher acid density of zeolite cata-
lysts over mesopore-structured MCM-41 and SBA-15, ZSM-5 and beta
zeolites led to the marked selectivity towards mono-aromatics, partic-
ularly reaching 10.3 area%, 19.8 area%, and 16.9 area% BTEX,
respectively. Fe/HY and Zr/HY show increased selectivity towards BTEX
in the catalytic pyrolysis of waste butadiene rubber, corresponding to
62.3 area% and 61.8 area%, respectively compared with standard HY
(43.4 area%) [417] and Co-supported HY zeolites. However, each
transition metal shows the favored selectivity for specific aromatics.
Fe/HY exhibits the catalytic activity to improve the yield of benzene and
toluene. Zr/HY was more beneficial in the production of xylene isomers
(20.0 area%).

6.6. Recovery of light olefins

Light olefins are a mixture of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, and
others. The C2-C4 olefins serve as the key platform feedstocks in the

petrochemical industry [418]. Downstream process for the C2-C4 olefins
facilitate a broad range of commercial applications. For example,
ethylene and propylene can be directly polymerized to produce PE/PP.
Their inherent reactivity imparted by pi bonds enables the production of
a hundred value-added chemicals, which is synthesized for several
polymers (including PVC, PET, PUR, PUR, PC, PA, and epoxy) [419].
Buteneâs are mainly exploited as the building stocks to produce alkylates
including BTEX [420]. The alkylate formations are used to synthesize
BR, SBR, PMMA, and others. The global trading market for light olefins
continuously expands at a growth rate of 4.5 % in the last two decades
[421]. The increasing trend is expected to reach 329.3 billion USD in
2028 [421]. Light olefins are typically produced through steam cracking
of naphtha at the elevated temperature (>800
C), referred to in Section
3.1.2. However, its excessive exploitation has posed unpredictable
environmental problems such as global warming. Thus, recovering light
olefins through thermo-chemical process of plastic wastes could be a
strategic approach to attenuate the environmental burdens by offsetting
the consumption of fossil resources. As shown in Table S12, the pro-
duction of light olefins from the pyrolysis of plastic waste can be realized
by adjusting various process parameters.

6.6.1. Light olefins from polyolefins

â¦

Many studies investigated the effectiveness of reaction temperature
to obtain high selectivity towards light olefins in the pyrolysis process.
The pyrolysis of HDPE in a continuous fluidized bed reactor and moni-
toring the concentrations of seven aliphatic groups (C1âC2 HCs, C3âC4
HCs, C5âC8 HCs, C9âC12 HCs, C13âC18 HCs, C19âC32 HCs, C33âC60 HCs)
and two aromatic groups (mono-aromatics and polynuclear-aromatics
(PNA)) at 400â1000
C shows that the formation of C1âC4 HCs was
nearly negligible at â¤500
C (Fig. 10 (a)) [422]. However, the temper-
ature initiating their production was 500
C. Ethylene dominates the
C. Simultaneously, the
composition of pyrolytic products at 700
enhanced formation of aromatic compounds (mono-aromatics and PNA)
was identified. This is likely ascribed to the recombination of light
olefins through the Diels-Alder reaction and subsequent dehydrogena-
tion. The pyrolysis of HDPE using steam as reaction medium yielded the
highest levels of light olefins (23.7 wt%) at 700
C [423]. The significant
reduction of propene and formation of BTX were observed at 800

C.

The residence time of volatiles in the pyrolysis reactor affects the
product distribution towards light olefins. Fu et al. [424] established a
two-staged pyrolysis setup to produce light olefins from HDPE pyrolysis
using two pyrolysis reactors separately set as 500 and 800
C. The yield
of gaseous products was monitored by controlling the residence time of
pyrolytic volatiles from 0.2 to 0.8 s. The highest gas yield was observed
at the residence time of 0.4 s (Fig. 10 (b)). Further increase of the resi-
dence time to 0.8 s led to the decreased formation of light olefins. Butene
was consumed more than ethylene and propene. This alludes to greater
vulnerability of butene to be recombined via the Diels-Alder reaction to
form the aromatic compounds. Della Zassa et al. [426] evaluated the
effectiveness of heating rate on the production of light olefins by ther-
(cid:0) 1 between 100 and 900
â¦
mally degrading LLDPE at 150â400
C. The
(cid:0) 1) enhanced the ethylene yield compared
faster heating rate (300
(cid:0) 1). The residence
to the results under the lower heating rate (150
C h
time of pyrolytic vapors (0.4 s) imparted by the faster heating rate
decreased by three times. Thus, the short vapor residence time is
responsible for the enhanced conversion of PE into light olefins, simul-
taneously avoiding the unwanted secondary condensation.

A great deal of research aimed to lower the temperatures producing
light olefins through catalytic pyrolysis. To this end, a consecutive
pyrolysis-catalysis system was widely adopted. The sample and catalyst
were placed in the center of the first and second bed, respectively. This
setup offers an advantage in blocking the fast deactivation of catalysts.
The injection of HDPE into a conical spouted-bed reactor operating at
500
C resulted in the primary pyrolytic products mainly comprised of
C21+ HCs (93 wt%) with negligible formation of light olefins [427]. An
increase of the second pyrolysis temperature (900
C) led to additional

â¦

â¦

â¦

thermal cracking of the wax-like HCs, resulting in C2âC4 light olefins of
76.0 wt%. The individual mass of ethylene, propylene, and butenes was
39.8, 19.2, and 17.2 wt%, respectively. However, the inclusion of
HZSM-5 catalyst achieved comparable yields of light olefins at the lower
reaction temperature (550
C). The conversion of HDPE catalyzed by
FCC led to 1.6 times increased production of light olefins, equivalent to
49.3 wt% [428]. Meanwhile, the use of ZSM-5 results in ethylene (18.5
wt%), propene (22.3 wt%), and butene (28.5 wt%) production. This
indicates that the stronger acidity of ZSM-5 favorably shortens the car-
bon length of LDPE over FCC catalyst. Similarly, analysis of the catalytic
pyrolysis of HDPE using HZSM-5, HUSY, and SAHA shows that their
characteristic acidity and porosity play a significant role in obtaining the
desired product streams [429]. Product selectivity towards light HCs
was enhanced when catalysts have a stronger acidity. Indeed, the cat-
alytic cracking of HDPE by HZSM-5 and SAHA produces the C3âC5
olefinic HCs as 80 and 40 wt%, respectively. Micropores of HZSM-5
prevent the accessibility of
large molecular HCs (stemming from
HDPE) to internal acid sites owing to their diffusional hindrance. In
contrast, the larger pore size of HUSY promotes catalytic reaction of
pyrolytic volatiles. However, the strong acidity of HUSY is susceptible to
undergo fast carbon deposition, thereby lowering the light olefin pro-
duction. SAHA has a stronger tolerance against catalyst deactivation
owing to the lower acidity compared with HUSY, leading to more pro-
ductivity for the light olefins.

â¦

Eschenbacher et al. [430] prepared a series of phosphorus-modified
HZSM-5 (P/ZSM-5) to produce light olefins through the pyrolysis of
polyolefins (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, and PP) at 600
C. The phosphorus
modification helped prolong the lifetime of ZSM-5 by inhibiting its
dealumination [431]. Catalytic performances of P/ZSM-5 on different
plastics were distinguishable considering their inherent chemical
structures. The yield of C2âC4 light olefins (70 wt%) stemming from PP
was lower than the results from HDPE/LLDPE/LDPE (82.8/83.6/73.7 wt
%). This is likely because the methyl branches in the PP backbone
favorably form branched isomers, leading to the selective formation of
C9 olefin (2,4-methyl-1-pentene) [432]. Notably, the production of
C2âC4 olefins
(79 wt%) obtained from the polyolefin mixture
(comprising HDPE (29.5 wt%), LLDPE (23 wt%), LDPE (7.5 wt%), and
PP (40 wt%)) is associated with the composition of each plastic. This is
attributed to the independently occurring thermal degradations from
different plastics. Liu et al. [425] tested the catalytic conversion of C5âC7
saturated HCs (dominant products present in naphtha) to produce the
light olefins. Two degradation routes imparted by transition metals
modified ZSM-5 were proposed (Fig. 10 (c)). In path I, protonation and
subsequent thermal cracking occur at the BrÃ¸nsted acid sites of ZSM-5,
showing the low selectivity for the light olefins. However, sequential
catalytic reactions of transition metals and zeolite supports an altered
degradation pathway. The Lewis acid sites in the transition metals
activate dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of H2 and alkenes.
Subsequently, thermal cracking of the alkenes into the light olefins on
the BrÃ¸nsted acid sites was processed in Path II. Thus, the use of
bifunctional catalysts helps transform C5âC7 alkanes into C2âC4 light
olefins.

Catalyst configuration in the pyrolysis system affects the productiv-
ity towards light olefins. Xue et al. [433] compared the product distri-
bution obtained from in-situ and ex-situ arrangements of HZSM-5.
Employing ex-situ catalyst in the pyrolysis of PP led to much higher
production (74.2 wt%) of light olefins compared to that using in-situ
catalyst (21.6 wt%). Also, the compositional matrices of pyrolytic gases
were significantly changed. Ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis selectively pro-
duced propylene, ethylene, and butylene, while the product streams
obtained from in-situ catalytic pyrolysis include propane, butane, and
propylene.

6.6.2. Light olefins from other polymers

Unlike PE and PP, the recovery of C2âC4 olefins from plastic waste
comprising other polymers is rarely studied. This is because the inherent

25

â¦

chemical structure of other polymers is not favored in obtaining light
olefins. Thus, the formation of light olefins is deemed the side products
in the pyrolysis of plastic waste for the recovery of monomers and/or
aromatics [434]. The pyrolysis of PE, PP, PS, PET, and PVC at 700
C
shows comparable yields of gaseous products stemming from PE, PP,
and PET, while the volumetric composition for C2âC4 olefins was
significantly different (55.6 % for PE, 64.9 % for PP, and 4.9 % for PET)
[435,436]. The pyrolysis of PS and PVC led to the negligible formation
of C2âC4 olefins. Witpathomwong et al. [437] promoted the conversion
of waste tire into light olefins using MCM-48 catalyst. Pyrolysis led to
12.5 wt% gaseous product which mainly comprises C4âC5 HCs with
negligible concentrations of ethylene and propylene. This is because tire
is made from butadiene and isoprene. Thermal degradation of waste tire
catalyzed by the acid sites in MCM-48 enhances product selectivity for
ethylene (2.2 %) and propylene (2.5 %).

7. Fuel production from plastic waste via thermo-chemical
processes

7.1. Transportation fuels

Plastic wastes can be a promising resource in obtaining hydrocarbon
fuels since their component is comprised of long-chained HCs [438].
Indeed, the thermo-chemical process is effective to narrow carbon
number distribution of polymer into the levels for transportation fuels
(gasoline: C5âC12, diesel: C12âC23, and aviation fuel: C8âC16). Further-
more, the compositional matrixes of transportation fuels strongly affect
combustion efficiency in internal combustion engines. Gasoline is
comprised of C5âC12 branched and cyclic HCs, specified into 15 wt% of
n-alkanes, 25â40 wt% of iso-alkanes, 4â10 wt% of cycloalkanes, 2â5 wt.
% of alkenes, 20â50 wt% of aromatics. Due to their high volatility and
high enthalpy of the C-C bond, the gasoline possesses high resistance to
auto-ignition at a low temperature [439â441]. Also, the content of ar-
omatic HCs imparts a high octane rating [439,441]. In contrast, diesel
contains C12âC23 straight HCs, as detailed with 75 wt% of n-/iso-/-
cyclo-alkanes, 25 wt% of aromatics (alkylbenzenes and naphthalenes)

[442]. Combustion of diesel is primarily governed by auto-ignition. The
longer chain HCs of diesel facilitated satisfying the auto-ignition tem-
perature with the achievement of relatively higher boiling and flash
points compared to gasoline [443]. Aviation fuels, such as JET-A,
comprise of C8âC16 HCs with 20 wt% of n-alkanes, 40 wt% of
iso-alkanes, 20 wt% of cycloalkanes, 20 wt% of aromatics [444,445].
This specific chemical composition is essential to ensure reliable com-

The effectiveness of pyrolysis temperature to convert the trans-
portation fuels from plastic wastes was analyzed. Temperature is a
critical parameter controlling carbon distribution in pyrolytic products
since thermal energy governs the bond scissions in polymer chains. The

showed a maximum oil yield of HDPE, PP, and PS of 89.5 wt% (550
86.5 wt% (500
C), respectively [447]. Despite
the high conversion into oil, its composition is highly contingent on the
polymer types. The thermolysis of PS discharged aromatic HCs (mainly
styrene), while the pyrolytic products stemmed from PE/PP were
comprised of aliphatic HCs with a wide range of carbon distribution
(C6âC30). Thermolysis of PE using a semi-batch pyrolizer showed that
the pyrolytic products from PE were comprised of alkenes and alkanes
ranging from C7 to C36 [448]. However, the product selectivity towards
light (C7âC11), middle (C12âC20), and heavy (C21âC36) fractions were
different as the reaction temperature increases. The yield of light and
middle fractions decreased from 6.7 to 4.3 area% and from 42.5 to 32.2
area% when the temperature increased from 425 to 525
C. Meanwhile,
the heavy fraction increased from 50.7 to 63.5 area%. The mean mo-

Tiwari [449] reported the reason why a difference in the carbon number
distribution occurred. Polyolefins were thermally degraded through end

vation energy than random chain scissions. Thus, the production of light
low
and medium fractions by end chain scission is favored at

temperature. The secondary reactions (polycondensation and/or repo-
lymerization) could be exhibited when increasing the pyrolytic
temperature.

To effectively control product distribution, the use of a catalyst in the
thermolysis of plastic wastes has been widely studied. ZSM-5 helps to
narrow the product distribution into gasoline (C5âC15) and light oil
(C12âC28) ranged HCs in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE [450]. Specif-
ically, the great surface properties of ZSM-5 exhibit primary cracking of
HDPE on the external and/or macroporous surface. Subsequently, the
fragmented molecules diffused into ZSM-5 micropores. The intrinsic
texture properties of ZSM-5 led to the high selectivity towards gasoline
ranged HCs. Nevertheless, the overall yield for the gasoline fraction was
under 35 %. This is likely owing to a steric hindrance to restrict a mass
transfer of the pyrolytic volatiles into micropores in ZSM-5. Further-
more, strong acid strength of ZSM-5 favorably results in the considerable
mass of non-condensable gases. Marcilla et al. [451] compared the
product distributions obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of PE over
HZSM-5 and HUSY. HUSY has a relatively larger pore size than HZSM-5.
This allows easier accessibility of heavier HCs into the internal acid sites.
However, the weaker acid strength of HUSY over ZSM-5 led to pyrolytic
products with larger carbon number distribution. The use of HUSY was
effective in narrowing the product distribution into gasoline ranged
HCs.

Kassargy et al. [452] employed USY zeolite to shift the carbon
number distribution in pyrolytic oil stemming from PE and PP (Fig. 11
(a) and 11 (b)). Catalytic pyrolysis of PP led to a broader range of C5-C27
HCs compared with that from PE (C5âC15 HCs). A difference in the
product distribution is related to a stronger activity of adsorbing the
methyl branches in PP on the acid sites of USY. Notably, the product
selectivity (8.7 wt%) for C8-C11 aromatic compounds was higher than
that (5.7 wt%) from PP. This is likely because linear HCs evolved from
PE pyrolysis easily diffuse into internal active sites. Thus, a series of
cascade reactions (such as hydrogen transfer,
isomerization, and
aromatization) of linear HCs offers a favorable condition to form aro-
matic HCs. The pyrolytic products obtained from PE/PP were fraction-
ated at 160 and 220
C, respectively to obtain the gasoline-/diesel-like
product distribution. The production of gasoline fraction was much
higher than that of diesel fraction. The physical properties of the gaso-
line fraction were comparable to commercial fuels.

â¦

The thermolysis of polymers liberates the formation of unsaturated

â¦

HCs (olefins). However, saturated HCs (paraffins) are preferred for use
as transportation fuel owing to their superior combustion efficiency. The
addition of transition metals to acidic support was intensively attempted
as a strategic means to transform polymeric materials into the desired
paraffins. The acid sites promote the cracking of polymer chains, and
transition metals serve as a hydrogen donor to the intermediate mole-
cules. Hydrocracking induced by the bifunctional catalysts typically
occurs at a moderate temperature (300â450
C) and high hydrogen
pressure (2â15 MPa) [453]. Pt/WO3/ZrO2 catalyst was used to obtain
the desired gasoline-range HCs (C5-C12) from LDPE, Liu et al. [282]
prepared. Hydrocracking of LDPE was carried out at 200â300
C under
30 bar of H2. The use of Pt/WO3/ZrO2 was not effective in the catalytic
conversion of LDPE. The product distribution showed a broad ranged
carbon number (centered at C10), mainly comprised of branched HCs
(91 %). Various acid catalysts (HY, HZSM-5, Al-MCM-41, and others)
were mechanically blended to narrow the product distribution (Fig. 11
(c)). HZSM-5 favors the production of C1âC4 gases, while HBEA leads to
the generation of heavier HCs than HY. Thanks to the unique shape
selectivity, concurrent use with HY shifted the product distribution into
the gasoline-range HCs (centered at C5âC7) (Fig. 11 (d)). The results
were likely attributed to the characteristic acid strength and pore
structure of HY. An increase of BrÃ¸nsted acid strength in HY significantly
affects tuning the product distribution for gasoline.

â¦

Furthermore, the composition of aromatic components influences
the physico-chemical properties of fuels. The compositional matrixes are
contingent on the polymer types. Indeed, the thermolyses of PE and PP
results in the preferential formation of non-aromatic HCs. Recovering
the aromatics from PE and PP may be restricted owing to their linear
chemical structures. Aromatic polymers (PS, PC, and others) could be a
promising source to produce aromatic HC liquid fuels. The composition
of aromatic components in pyrolytic oil stemming from HDPE, LDPE,
and PP was below 6 % at 500
C [297]. In contrast, PS showed high
selectivity towards C5âC9 aromatic HCs (60.2 %). Therefore, the exis-
tence of PS in the thermolysis of mixed plastics serves as a potential
indicator to finely adjust the composition of aromatic formations in
pyrolytic oil.

â¦

The thermolysis of plastic wastes generates the formation of unsat-
urated HCs (olefins and aromatics). However, converting them into
saturated HCs (paraffins and cycloalkanes) is required to meet the
standard quality for jet fuel application. A great deal of research for the

fuels was studied. Their chemical recycling to recover the monomers are
preferred given that functional linkages of polar polymers (PET and PC)
could be selctively degraded when using solvents [459]. However, ar-
omatic monomers and their derivatives from PET and PC have a great
potential to be upgraded into cycloalkanes. The formation of cyclo-
alkanes can be utilized as crucial additives of aviation fuel. Tang et al.
[455] tried to recover gasoline fuel range C7-8 cycloalkanes from PET
using a series of thermo-chemical reactions (methanolysis, hydrogena-
tion, and hydrodeoxygenation) (Fig. 12 (b)). Chemical recycling by
methanol (at 200
C for 3.5 h) led to a high yield of DMT monomer (97.3
wt%). The generation of cyclic HCs is favored given that the DMT
monomer has the carbon number of 8 with a single benzene ring. Spe-
cifically, hydrogenation of DMT over Pt/AC catalyst and subsequent
dehydroxygenation over Ru-Cu/SiO2 catalyst results in the formation of
C7âC8 cycloalkanes. The successive conversions of PET show great
selectivity towards C7-C8 cycloalkanes (64.9 wt%). Similarly, the same
author [456] identified the feasibility to recover the jet fuel range HCs
from PC (Fig. 12 (c)). The carbon number of final products is contingent
on the chemical structure of BPA monomer (C15H16O2) obtained from
PC. The use of methanol as a reactive medium led to the selective
dissociation of PC, showing a high yield (90 wt%) of BPA. Subsequently,
the catalytic capability for the hydrodeoxygenation of BPA into C15
bicycloalkanes was evaluated by employing Pt/AC and various zeolites.
The hydrogenation of two benzene rings was favorably exhibited when
Pt/AC catalyst is combined with Hbeta, leading to the highest yield of
C13âC15 bicycloalkanes.

It is important to evaluate the physico-chemical properties (vola-
tility, density, calorific value, flash point, and freezing point) of oils
produced from plastic waste for the practical applications as trans-
portation fuels (Table S14). The characteristics of plastic-derived oils is
considerably contingent on a difference in the imparted chemical
structure of each plastic. Indeed, HDPE tends to have a higher viscosity
over PS. This is likely because a random degradation mechanism of
HDPE results in the formation of long-chain HCs. Nevertheless, the
(cid:0) 1, which is
overall heating value of plastic oil is greater than 40 MJ kg
comparable to those of transportation fuels. Their high heating values
show the possibility to perform well as transportation fuels in the in-
ternal combustion engine.

7.2. Syngas

Syngas (the mixture of H2 and CO) is recognized as an important
feedstock owing to its versatile applications such as heat and power
generation, valuable chemicals/fuels synthesis, and high purity H2
production. In the thermo-chemical process, syngas formation can be
obtained through a set of complex chemical reactions (Table S15 and
Fig. 13). Given that most chemical reactions are endothermic, the pro-
duction of syngas can be favorably made at 700
C. Syngas is a main
product obtained from the thermo-chemical process. Other end products
(H2O, CO2, CH4, C2-C4 light HCs, and high molecular HCs (tar)) are also
included in the gaseous products. Chemical composition of syngas in the
gaseous products is highly contingent on the feedstock type and thermo-
chemical operating condition.

â¦

Typically, gasification of coal and steam reforming of natural gas are
the major production routes to produce syngas. Despite the technical
maturity of these practices, it is important to seek an alternative
resource to abate excessive exploitation of the conventional ones.
Gasification of plastic wastes has gained an increasing attention for
syngas production since they are mostly manufactured using petroleum.
A calorific value of plastic wastes is comparable to those of petroleum.
Also, H2 and CO are the smallest molecular unit obtained from the
thermo-chemical process of plastic considering that their compositional
matrixes are mainly comprised of HCs wastes. Among various thermo-
chemical routes, gasification process has been particularly effective in
the production of syngas. Reaction pathways for the syngas production
could be altered under the type of gasifying agents (air, oxygen, steam,

â¦

hydrogenation of plastic wastes was performed to obtain the desired jet
fuel ranged HCs. For example, hydrogenation of HDPE to obtain the
desired jet-fuel ranged HCs was attempted in a closed batch reactor with
H2 (1 MPa) at 400
C for 2 h without solvents. Acid catalysts (Al2O3,
HZSM-5, and SAPO-11) were used as the supporting materials, and
transition metals (Ni and Co) were impregnated to provide the active
sites for hydrogen activation [454]. The inherent surface properties of
bifunctional catalysts altered the overall degradation pathways, leading
to the difference in the product distribution (Fig. 12 (a)). Ni/Al2O3
showed the highest oil yield (comprised with n-alkanes (78.9 area%))
owing to its weak acidity, while Ni/HZSM-5 exhibited the lowest oil
yield (dominated with aromatics (56.8 area%)) owing to its acid
strength. SAPO-11 resulted in marked selectivity towards n-alkanes
(54.8 area%), iso-alkanes (19.2 area%), alkenes (4.1 area%), and aro-
matics (16.1 area%). The composition of pyrolytic oil obtained from
HDPE over SAPO-11 was comparable to that of commercial jet fuels. The
contents of alkenes and aromatics should be below 5 % and 20 %,
respectively. Thus, the use of SAPO-11 in the hydrogenation of HDPE
has a feasible potential enabling it to be directly utilized as an additive to
improve jet fuel performance.

Zhang et al. [457] tested the feasibility of activated carbon (AC) for
catalytic upgrading of volatiles
stemming from LDPE. Surface
morphology of AC was dispersed with mesopores. The mesopores help to
increase the accessibility of volatiles to the internal acid sites. AC
strongly narrowed the carbon number distribution towards aviation fuel
ranged HCs (C8âC16). Notably, a difference in the activation method of
AC led to the modification of compositional matrixes. Steam AC led to
the catalytic conversion of LDPE into alkane-rich HCs (78.2 area%). In
contrast, chemically phosphorus acid AC led to the improved production
of aromatic HCs (51.6 area%). These results can be explained because
the strong acid sites imparted by phosphorous acid favorably undergo
aromatization. Product selectivity towards aliphatic and/or aromatic
HCs in the carbon range of C8-16 can be minutely adjusted under the
activation methods of AC. The same research group [458] also enabled
the upgrading effect of thermolytic volatiles by impregnating a series of
transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ag) on the support AC.
The use of transition metals is expected to promote the dissociation of
C-C and C-H bonds. Fe impregnated AC catalyst exhibited the best per-
formance in the product selectivity on jet fuel (81.3 area%). In detail, the
iron sites helped to expedite hydrogen transfer between olefins and
cycloalkanes, leading to the enhanced production of alkanes and aro-
matics. Thus, the proportion of alkanes and aromatics in jet fuel pro-
duction can be minutely adjusted by adding transition metals.

CO2, and so on), as provided in Table S16).The use of catalysts in the
pyrolysis system expedites the conversion of plastic waste into syngas.
Zeolites are preferably used owing to their strong acidity facilitating C-C
bond scissions. For example, Zeolite 5A is an adsorbent that traps the
pyrolytic products and further cracks them into light HCs. Also, the use
of transition metals helps the selective dissociation of C-H bonds. Sva-
dlenak et al. [460] tested catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE in the presence of
zeolite 5A and Ni/Al2O3. Nevertheless, zeolite 5A shows low selectivity
for syngas (<5 vol%). Sequential arrangement of zeolite 5A and
Ni/Al2O3 significantly increases the yield of H2 (1.6â14.8 vol%) and CO
(0.8â3.2 vol%) compared to zeolite 5A. Dehydrogenation promoted by
Ni/Al2O3 led to an increase in the H2/CO molar ratio from 2.08 to 4.63.
Impregnation of transition metals to zeolite supports offers a chance
to enhance the functionality for syngas production. High specific surface
area of zeolites facilitates an even dispersion of the transition metals.

(Ni/ZSM-5, Ni/Y, and Ni/beta) for the steam-assisted pyrolysis of HDPE.

ducted the thermo-chemical conversion of municipal plastic waste into
syngas using Me-Ni/ZSM-5 (Me = Ca, Ce, La, Mg, and Mn). The addition
of several metal promoters improved the catalytic activity and stability
of Ni/zeolite catalyst. Municipal plastic waste comprises LDPE (17 wt
%), HDPE (14 wt%), PP (19 wt%), PET (45 wt%), and others (5 wt%).
Catalytic pyrolysis with Ni/ZSM-5 at 850
C showed the highest syngas
(cid:0) 1). Among various metal promoters, Ce and La
yield (81.4 m3 kg
noticeably improved the product selectivity towards hydrogen. The
H2/CO molar ratios catalyzed by Ce-Ni/ZSM-5 and La-Ni/ZSM-5 were
1.76 and 1.94, which are larger than the result from Ni/ZSM-5 (1.55).
The same author [463] modified the catalyst bed by adding dolomite
(CaMg(CO3)2) in the catalytic conversion of municipal plastic waste.
The use of dolomite can be deemed an external source to provide CO2,
because thermal degradation of MgCO3 and CaCO3 present in dolomite
releases CO2 at â¥400 and 800
C. Given that CO2 participates in diverse
reforming processes, CO2 (stemming from dolomite) serves as a reactive
gas for the enhanced production of syngas. Indeed, synergetic use of CO2
and Ce-Ni/ZSM-5 led to the increased yield of syngas (68.2â80.3 vol%),

Although CO2 enables the enhanced production of syngas, the

â¦

â¦

reforming process is activated at â¥700
C (Table S15). One research
group has made an intensive effort to investigate the mechanistic roles
of CO2 in the pyrolysis temperature regime (â¤700
C) [466â470]. Cat-
alytic pyrolysis of several plastic wastes over transition metal-based
catalysts was carried out. Ni and Co catalysts were preferably adopted
owing to their affordability and catalytic capability of dissociating the
chemical bonds in plastic waste [471]. Catalytic pyrolysis of waste
fishing net (comprised of PE) in the presence of 10 wt% Co/SiO2 catalyst
showed that PE has no oxygen source in the polymer backbone, while
using CO2 as reaction medium led to CO production (10.9 vol%) [467].
CO formation cannot be explained without an additional source of
carbon and oxygen. This proves that the functionality of CO2 is derived
from its reaction with pyrolytic HCs stemming from PE. Catalytic py-
rolysis of vehicle bumper waste (mainly consisting of PP) under various
CO2 showed that catalytic conversion of PP/CO2 into CO was propor-
tional to [CO2] in the flow gas [466]. The H2/CO molar ratio obtained
from catalytic pyrolysis with 5 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst was adjusted in the
range of 3.8 to 1.1.

Similarly, various plastic wastes such as plastic cups (comprising
PET), automotive headlight housing (comprising PC), automotive seat
foam (comprising PUR), and synthetic textiles (comprising PA6) were
valorized into syngas in the thermo-chemical platform [468â470,472].
H2 production is strongly contingent on the specific structure of mono-
mers present in plastics. The productivity of H2 stemming from PET, PC,
and PUR was much lower than that from PA6. Dehydrogenation is the
main route to produce H2. Therefore, benzene rings in PET, PC, and PUR
lower the hydrogen content in plastics. In contrast, CO production de-
pends on the reaction kinetics of CO2 and volatile HCs liberated from
plastics. The effectiveness of CO2 catalyzed by Ni catalyst considerably
increased CO formation. Thus, the H2/CO molar ratios obtained from
PET, PC, and PUR were 0.16, 0.22, and 0.35, which were much lower
than that from PE/PP.

7.2.1. Practical applications of syngas

Syngas has a great potential to be utilized for various practical ap-
plications in the energy and chemical industry. It is typically utilized for
the generation of heat and power considering that gasification processes
allow the calorific value in plastic wastes to be converted into
combustible syngas. As such, syngas is commonly obtained from air
gasification and its direct use in the internal combustion engines is the
main application. However, a selection of different gasifying agents
noticeably alters the chemical composition of gasifying products. In
particular, steam in the gasification process offers a favorable chance to
increase the molar ratio of H2 to CO. In contrast, the use of CO2 con-
tributes to a decrease in the H2 to CO ratio. Controlling the amounts of
gasifying agents to be reacted with thermolytic volatiles stemming from
plastic wastes enables fine tuning of the molar ratio of H2 to CO. It could
be exploited for the synthesis of valuable chemicals and fuels under a
controllable H2/CO ratio considering a high reactivity of syngas.
Chemical synthesis using syngas (stemming from plastic wastes) is of

great significance since this system offers a potential way to realize the
circular economy in the petrochemical industry (Table 7).

Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier owing to its high energy
density and clean byproducts. As such, the use of H2 for proton exchange
membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) in the automotive sector is gaining
increasing attention [482]. Steam gasification of plastic wastes and
subsequent water-gas-shift reactions could be a strategic means to
obtain high purity H2. However, trace impurities could be one of the
major contributors to rapidly lower the efficiency of fuel cell cycles. For
example, the CO concentration in H2-rich gasifying products must be <
10 ppm [483]. This is because CO is the critical molecule in deactivating
Pt catalysts of the PEMFC electrode. Also, the CO2 concentration level
should be lowered below 25 vol% since CO2 could be a potential source
to generate CO via the reverse water-gas-shift reaction [484]. Compo-
sitional quality of gasifying products is being stringently regulated for
the commercial application of H2 in the fuel cell system (Table 7). To
meet the rigorous standard, additional H2 purifying techniques (such as
thermal or pressure swing adsorption system) were typically estab-
lished, enabling the production of extremely pure H2 (95â99.999 mol.
%) [482,485].

Ammonia (NH3) is gaining emerging attention since it acts as the
energy and hydrogen carrier. A mole of N2 can react with 3 mol of H2 to
form 2 mol of NH3. Ammonia has a greater advantage over hydrogen in
its storage and transportation since liquefaction of NH3 can be made at
â¦
relatively higher temperature ((cid:0) 33
C) and lower pressure (0.87 MPa)
[474,486]. NH3 production is frequently conducted in the presence of
iron catalyst, showing a conversion efficiency of 20â35 % [486,487].
Given that nitrogen can be entirely obtained from air by means of ASU,
sustainable and economic NH3 production are strongly influenced by
hydrogen purifying processes [488]. CO and CO2 in the gasifying
products adversely affect the ammonia synthetic process by poisoning
the iron catalyst. The combined concentration of CO and CO2 should be
kept under 20 ppm (Table 7) [487,489].

Hydrocarbons can be synthesized using syngas by means of the
Fischer-Tropsch process. This practice is one of the commercial practices
for syngas utilization. Linear HCs with a carbon number of C1 to C33 can
be made with a small quantity of oxygenated side products (alcohols).
Given that HCs are synthesized with two single elements (H2 and CO),
the product quality is high with no formation of impurities. Neverthe-
less, the product distribution is greatly contingent on the catalyst type
and operating parameters (temperature, pressure, and residence time)
[480]. Screening the suitable catalyst is of great importance in pro-
ducing desired HCs. Fe and Co-based catalysts are particularly adopted
in the synthesis of HCs between 200 and 350
C and a pressure range of
2.5â6 MPa (Table 7) [490]. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalyzed by a Fe
catalyst favorably produces light olefinic HCs. In contrast, the use of Co
catalyst tends to generate alcoholic products rather than light olefins
since it has a higher hydrogenation reactivity [476,480]. Consequently,
the production of higher molecular weight HCs is favored when using Co
catalyst between 200 and 250
C. Subsequently, thermal cracking of the
produced waxy products can narrow the product distribution into
diesel-ranged HCs.

Methanol is one of the most representative platform chemicals hav-
ing various downstream applications. For example, it can be directly
used as a clean fuel or a gasoline additive. Also, the formation of valu-
able chemicals/fuels (formaldehyde, acetic acid, dimethyl ether, and
others) can be synthesized by using methanol as the building block
feedstock. Indeed, over 11 wt% of global syngas production is converted
into methanol [491]. Methanol consumption to produce formaldehyde,
light HCs, and gasoline accounts for 25, 22, and 16 wt%, respectively
[491]. Methanol is commonly synthesized through the thermo-chemical
conversion of syngas and CO2 (CO + 2H2 â CH3OH or CO2 + 3H2 â
CH3OH + H2O) [492,493]. Indeed, 2.53 Ã 103 m3 of syngas (comprised
of 70 % H2, 21 % CO, and 7 % CO2) is consumed to produce 1 ton of
methanol [480]. Copper-zinc oxide (Cu/ZnO) is the most commonly
used catalyst for the synthesis of methanol from syngas [491]. The high

30

affinity of Cu/ZnO to H2, CO, and CO2 allows catalytic conversion of
syngas into methanol at mild operating conditions (Table 7) [477,491].
The low reaction temperature contributed the great selectivity towards
methanol (>99.5 %).

In addition to methanol, other alcohols (2-methyl-2-butanol, n-
butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, and isononyl) can also be synthesized when
employing syngas and olefins as the starting feedstocks. The formation
of alcohols can be obtained through tandem reaction of hydro-
formylation and hydrogenation. Hydroformylation is the process that
syngas reacts with olefins, resulting in the formation of aldehydes [494].
To achieve this, the H2/CO molar ratio of 1â1.5 is favored (Table 7)
[481]. Subsequently, hydrogenation of the produced aldehydes enabled
the formation of alcohols. Importantly, the chemical structure of inter-
mediate aldehydes obtained from hydroformylation strongly affects the
final alcohol composition. The cascade reactions for alcohol production
can be commonly activated in the presence of Co or Rh based catalysts
[495]. The aldehyde products can be immediately reduced to the cor-
responding alcohols owing to the high hydrogenation activity of these
catalysts [494].

8. Challenges and opportunities

The thermo-chemical process stands out as a strategic avenue for the
valorization of plastic wastes, offering distinct advantages in the pro-
duction of chemicals and energies. This method allows for the delinea-
tion of specific thermo-chemical conversion routes targeting key
products such as monomers, light olefins, BTEX, transportation fuels,
and syngas. Importantly, the attainment of these products is contingent
upon the careful management of operating conditions, providing a level
of control over the process. Notably, the employment of a judiciously
chosen catalyst enhances the selectivity towards desired end-products,
further optimizing the efficiency of the thermo-chemical conversion.
However, it is imperative to recognize that the product distribution
resulting from the thermo-chemical process is intricately linked to the
type and chemical composition of the plastic waste being processed. The
inherent characteristics of the input material significantly influence the
the polymer
outcome, necessitating a nuanced understanding of
composition to tailor the process for optimal results. In summary, the
thermo-chemical process emerges as a potent tool for the valorization of
plastic wastes, offering flexibility in directing conversion routes and
benefiting from catalyst-driven selectivity. However, the intimate rela-
tionship between product distribution and the specific attributes of the
plastic waste underscores the importance of a comprehensive under-
standing of the feedstock for the effective implementation of this
approach.

The collection of plastic waste from MSW is relatively straightfor-
ward owing to its prevalence in consumer patterns. However, the
sensitivity of the composition of plastic waste to public consumption
habits poses challenges to achieving consistent quality, as discussed in
Section 2. The realistic nature of plastic waste is highly heterogeneous,
likely incorporating various polymer blends and additive chemicals such
as pigments, dyes, coatings, and metals, as detailed in Section 3. This
heterogeneity presents a barrier to the seamless realization of thermo-
chemical recycling, further discussed in the aforementioned section.
Despite the thermo-chemical process demonstrating a significant toler-
ance to impurities, the quality of the end product is susceptible to
adverse effects from the raw material (plastic waste). Notably, plastic
mixtures often contain PVC, the thermolysis of which liberates HCl,
which poses a significant threat to machinery integrity. Additionally,
halogen compounds released during the thermolysis of PVC can deac-
tivate the catalyst, compromising the efficiency of recycling mixed

pre-treatments are essential to selectively sort out PVC. However, these
additional processes are recognized as a primary impediment to the
economic feasibility of thermo-chemical recycling. The necessity for
intricate sorting and pre-treatment procedures adds complexity and cost

to the overall recycling process, highlighting the delicate balance be-
tween the environmental benefits of plastic waste recycling and the
economic viability of the associated technologies.

The recycling of plastic waste presents a promising avenue towards
achieving a circular economy given its origin in the petrochemical in-
dustry. Nevertheless, only 9 wt% of total plastic waste generation is
currently recycled. The rest is mismanaged or subjected to the conven-
tional disposals (landfilling and incineration), posing critical environ-
mental concerns (Section 4). The poor recycling rate for plastic waste
represents a significant challenge to the sustainable development goals
(SDGs) provided by the United Nations. Establishing appropriate recy-
cling systems for plastic wastes could help satisfy specific SDG targets.
The development of innovative technologies for plastic waste valoriza-
tion promotes sustainable industrialization, aligning with SDG 9 (in-
dustry, innovation, and infrastructure). Also, the reduction of plastic
wastes and their simultaneous conversion into value-added products
support SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). Further-
more, the thermo-chemical conversion of plastic wastes pacifies a haz-
ardous potential
conventional disposal,
contributing to SDG 13 (climate action). In an effort to seek an appro-
priate recycling technique for plastic wastes, the technical merits and
demerits of several candidates were compared in Section 5. It was
confirmed that the thermo-chemical conversion emerges as an appealing
option given the complicated compositional nature of plastic wastes.

associated with their

Plastic waste primarily comprises HCs which can be effectively
converted into valuable chemicals and fuels. Currently, six representa-
tive polymersâPE, PP, PS, PVC, and PETâdominate plastic consump-
tion, collectively accounting for over 70 wt% of total plastic production.
The thermo-chemical process, a key method for plastic waste conver-
sion, yields product distributions contingent on the specific polymer
present in the plastics. This dependence arises from the distinct chemical
structures of each polymer, characterized by unique repeating units
(monomers). Consequently, the intrinsic thermolytic behaviors of each

polymer contribute to variations in the thermal degradation mechanism,
a topic explored in detail in Section 6. Consequently, there is a prefer-
ence for specific thermo-chemical conversion routes tailored to the re-
covery of desired products from plastic waste. In essence, recognizing
the diverse composition of plastic waste (especially considering the
prevalence of the six representative polymers) underscores the impor-
tance of adopting targeted thermo-chemical approaches. This under-
standing informs the development of more efficient and selective
recycling processes, optimizing the conversion of plastic waste into
valuable chemicals and fuels, thereby advancing the goals of a circular
economy.

The thermal degradation of polyolefins such as PE and PP follows a
mechanism of random chain scission, yielding a broad range of HCs. To
refine the product distribution, various catalytic materials were
employed, among which zeolites have exhibited noteworthy charac-
teristics. Zeolites with strong acidity promote the notable shortening of
hydrocarbon chain lengths, favorably the generation of C2-C4 light
olefins, as discussed in Section 6.6. Simultaneously, the distinctive pore
structure of zeolites facilitates secondary reactions, including isomeri-
zation and aromatization, leading to the formation of BTEX (benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers) in the catalytic pyrolysis of
polyolefins, as detailed in Section 6.5. Moreover, the recovery of
transportation fuels from polyolefins becomes feasible with the use of
transition metals or transition metals impregnated zeolites, which
facilitate hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking. The catalytic capability of
these transition metals to activate the C-H bond proves beneficial for
saturating olefinic HCs, allowing for the adjustment of hydrocarbon
chain lengths suitable to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. This
aspect is thoroughly discussed in Section 7.1. In the broader context of
the thermo-chemical process for plastic waste conversion, the genera-
tion of combustible syngas is a significant outcome. The introduction of
reactive gases, such as steam and CO2, in the pyrolysis temperature
regime enhances syngas production, as elaborated in Section 7.2.

process in the chemical and energy industry.

Subsequently, the controllable adjustment of H2 to CO molar ratio en-
ables practical and commercial applications of syngas, further contrib-
uting to the versatility and utility of the thermo-chemical recycling
process.

In contrast to polyolefins, the thermo-chemical processing of PS and
PET proves particularly suitable for monomer recovery owing to their
distinct structural characteristics, as elucidated in Section 6.4. The uti-
lization of catalysts has enhanced yields in the recovery of monomers,
such as styrene and TPA, attributed to the selective degradation of
specific positions in the polymer chains. Moreover, the presence of an
aromatic ring in PS and PET presents a favorable opportunity for the
formation of BTEX. In the case of PET, achieving the selective dissoci-
ation of the ester linkage in the polymer chain was effectively realized
using metal oxides, leveraging their exceptional deoxygenation capa-
bilities, as discussed in Section 6.4. Subsequent hydrogenation of aro-
matic intermediates originating from PS and PET facilitates the
production of cycloalkanes. These saturated HCs are recognized as
essential components to meet the quality requirements of transportation
fuels, a critical aspect detailed in Section 8.1. The unique thermo-
chemical behaviors of PS and PET underscore the potential
for
tailored processes that recover valuable monomers and yield products
conducive to meeting specific quality standards, particularly in the
context of transportation fuel production.

Given the intrinsic diversity in the thermo-chemical properties of
various plastics, their thermal degradations occur independently. When
heterogeneous plastic wastes are subjected to thermal degradation,
there is an expected sequential volatilization of each plastic based on the
low thermal stability of the component polymer. This characteristic
creates an opportunity for the fractionation of plastic mixtures, wherein
each polymer gradually volatilizes at temperatures corresponding to its
individual thermal stability (Fig. 14). This proposed system bears a
considerable resemblance to the distillation towers employed in petro-
leum refineries. While the volatilization temperatures of individual
polymers may be distributed within a narrow range, the temperature
required in the distillation system can be broadened by adjusting other
operating parameters such as pressure, the length of the distillation
tower, and other relevant factors [497]. In this context, a single
component polymer within plastic mixtures can be effectively frac-
tionated into thermolytic volatiles. The subsequent thermo-chemical
conversion of these thermolytic volatiles enables the production of
desired end products. This approach, akin to the distillation processes in
petroleum refining, provides a method for systematically separating and
processing various plastics within a heterogeneous mixture. The ability
to tailor operating parameters allows for the optimization of the frac-
tionation process, contributing to the efficient utilization of plastic
waste in the thermo-chemical recycling system.

9. Conclusions

The superior physico-chemical attributes of plastics,

including
affordability, durability, lightness, and non-corrosivity, have promoted
their applications in various fields. However, their short lifespan and
non-biodegradability pose significant environmental hazards. In the
context of a circular economy, recycling plastic wastes emerges as a
promising avenue to simultaneously achieve their environmentally
responsible disposal and generation of alternative resources. There are
various technical routes for converting plastic wastes into corresponding
plastics, polymers, or monomers. However, the inherent heterogeneity
of plastic waste has been a major impediment to achieve optimal con-
version efficiency. In this regard, the thermo-chemical process of plastic
waste appeals as a potent strategic means to transform carbon from
plastic wastes into value-added chemicals and fuels. The judicious se-
lection of operating parameters allows for a targeted product distribu-
tion, encompassing desired products such as monomers, light olefins,

structure and thermo-chemical stability of different plastics play a sig-
nificant role in determining the preference for specific thermo-chemical
routes. This review outlines a viable technical pathway for valorizing
plastic waste through the thermo-chemical platform, emphasizing the
importance of recognizing the inherent characteristics of recycling
plastic wastes independently. The introduction of mixed plastic waste
into a distillation tower system holds great potential for sequentially
separating each polymer component. Subsequently, the pyrolytic vola-
tiles derived from this separation can be converted into valuable
chemicals and fuels with high product quality. This comprehensive in-
formation on the thermo-chemical recycling process of plastic waste
should serve as a valuable guideline in the pursuit of a closed-loop cir-
cular economy within the chemical and energy industry.
