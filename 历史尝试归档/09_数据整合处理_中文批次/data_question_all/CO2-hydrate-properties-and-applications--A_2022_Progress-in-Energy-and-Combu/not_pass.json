    "question_text": "Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, derive the dissociation enthalpy for CO2 hydrate. Discuss how this value compares to CH4 hydrate and its implications for cold storage applications.",
    "standard_answer": "The modified Clausius-Clapeyron equation: d(lnP)/d(1/T) = ΔH / (ZR)), where Z is compressibility factor. For CO2 hydrate, ΔH_dis ≈ 507 kJ/kg, while CH4 hydrate ΔH_dis ≈ 427 kJ/kg. The difference stems from CO2's stronger guest-host interactions. The dissociation enthalpy is calculated from phase equilibrium data: ΔH_dis = T ΔV (dP/dT)), where ΔV is the volume change during dissociation. Experimentally, CO2 hydrate has higher thermal stability, making it suitable for cold storage. The enthalpy is related to cage occupancy; CO2 prefers large cages. The dissociation process involves breaking hydrogen bonds; CO2-water hydrogen bond energy is higher than CH4-water. For sI CO2 hydrate: ΔH_dis = 414 kJ/kg gas. The larger enthalpy for CO2 hydrate indicates more energy required to dissociate, but also more energy released during formation. This makes CO2 hydrate advantageous for CTES systems. The latent heat storage capacity is 128-153 L/L depending on particle size. The dissociation rate is controlled by heat transfer at the interface. The molecular dynamics simulations show that CO2 hydrate has higher mechanical strength due to denser packing. The thermal conductivity is also higher, improving heat exchange efficiency. In refrigeration cycles, the COP can reach 11.55 for CO2 hydrate systems, higher than conventional systems. The key parameters are: temperature (260-280 K), pressure (2-4 MPa). The theoretical maximum based on sI structure (CO2·5.75H2O) gives theoretical gas storage 170 v/v at STP. The phase change temperature range (5-12°C) is ideal for air conditioning.",
