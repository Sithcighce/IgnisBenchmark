    "standard_answer": "For GDLs, the Brooks-Corey model describes water relative permeability k_rw as: k_rw = s^(3+2/λ), where s is water saturation and λ is pore size distribution index (typically 2-4 for carbon paper). The paper presents experimental data fitting to k_rw = s^3, suggesting λ≈2. The derivation starts from Burdine's model: k_rw = s_wp^2 * ∫[ds_wp/P_c^2]/∫[ds_wp/P_c^2]_0^1. For Brooks-Corey P_c = P_entry*s_wp^(-1/λ), this integrates to k_rw = s_wp^(2+3λ/λ). The paper notes: 'Willie's equation was originally derived for well-sorted hydrophilic sands...do not fully represent the diffusion phenomena'. Experimental data shows deviation at s>0.5 due to water clustering effects.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Willie's equation was originally derived for well-sorted hydrophilic sands, whose microstructural characteristics are quite different from those of GDLs",
      "2": "these microstructural differences seem to yield significantly different water saturation behaviors for GDLs"
