    "standard_answer": "Carbon nanoparticles enhance thermal conductivity through both static and dynamic mechanisms. Static mechanisms include: (1) Nanolayer formation - a solid-like interfacial layer forms between nanoparticles and base liquid molecules, acting as a thermal bridge (thermal conductivity enhancement ~15-30%). The thickness δ of this layer follows δ ≈ 0.1r_p where r_p is particle radius. (2) Aggregation - nanoparticles form fractal clusters with high aspect ratio networks (typically 10-100 nm scale) that enable rapid heat conduction, though interfacial Kapitza resistance R_k ≈ 10^-8 m²K/W limits effectiveness. Dynamic mechanisms involve Brownian motion inducing micro-convection. The Brownian velocity v_B = (k_BT/3πηd_p) where η is viscosity and d_p particle diameter. This creates micro-convective heat transfer with Peclet number Pe = v_Bd_p/α_f ≈ 0.1-1 for typical nanofluids. The relative contribution can be analyzed through time scale comparison: τ_diffusion ~ d_p²/α_f vs τ_Brownian ~ d_p/v_B. For d_p < 50 nm, Brownian effects dominate (contributing ~40-60% of enhancement).",

    "standard_answer": "The modified Maxwell-Garnett equation incorporating nanolayer effects is: K_eff = K_bf * [K_pe + 2K_bf + 2φ(1+β)^3(K_pe-K_bf)]/[K_pe + 2K_bf - φ(1+β)^3(K_pe-K_bf)] where K_pe = K_p[(2(1-γ)+(1+β)^3(1+2γ))/((1-γ)+(1+β)^3(1+2γ))], γ = K_layer/K_p, β = δ/r_p. For CNT/ethanol: K_p = 3000 W/mK (CNT), K_bf = 0.167 W/mK (ethanol), φ = 0.002, δ = 2 nm, r_p = 25 nm → β = 0.08. Assuming K_layer = 5 W/mK → γ = 0.00167. Calculating K_pe = 3000[(2(0.99833)+(1.08)^3(1.00334))/(0.99833+(1.08)^3(1.00334))] ≈ 3025 W/mK.

This maintains maximum effective evaporation area σ ≈ 1. For Pe ≫ 1 (K >> D_p), particles accumulate at droplet surface forming hollow aggregates because τ_diff > τ_evap, reducing σ ≈ (1-φ_surf) where φ_surf is surface particle volume fraction. Experimental data shows σ decreases exponentially with Pe: σ = exp(-0.5Pe^0.7). For GrNPL/n-decane at φ=4% w/w, D_p≈10^-11 m²/s and K≈10^-7 m²/s gives Pe≈12.5, predicting σ≈0.65 matching measured 0.63±0.05. The critical transition occurs at Pe_c≈1 where σ drops below 0.95. This morphology directly affects evaporation rate d(d²)/dt = Kσ, causing late-stage rate reduction up to 35% for high Pe systems.",

    "question_text": "Explain the competing mechanisms that cause non-monotonic dependence of burning rate enhancement on nanoparticle concentration.",
    "standard_answer": "The non-monotonic trend arises from competing mechanisms: (1) Thermal enhancement dominates at low φ (<0.3% w/w) where increased thermal conductivity ΔK/K_bf ≈ 1 + 3φ(K_p/K_bf) and radiation absorption (absorption coefficient μ_a ≈ φQ_ext/4r_p, Q_ext≈2 for CNTs) linearly improve heat transfer to droplet interior. (2) Aggregation suppression emerges at mid φ (0.3-1% w/w) as interparticle distance L ≈ (φ)^(-1/3) decreases below 100 nm, increasing collision frequency f_coll ≈ k_BT/3πηL³. This forms conductive clusters but reduces active evaporation area. (3) Shell formation dominates at high φ (>1% w/w) where φ_surf ≈ φ(1+Pe) exceeds percolation threshold φ_c≈0.15, creating impermeable layers with thermal resistance R_shell ≈ t_shell/K_shell (t_shell≈1μm, K_shell≈10 W/mK). For Jet-A/GNP at φ=1.5%, cluster size reaches ~5μm reducing effective K by 40%. The peak enhancement occurs at φ_opt≈0.5% where d(K_eff)/dφ balances d(σ)/dφ, typically giving 15-25% BR increase before declining.",

    "standard_answer": "The CR number is CR = τ_particle/τ_d = (L_m²/2D_p)/(d₀²/K) where L_m = (V_d/n)^(1/3) = (4πr_d³/3φ)^(1/3), D_p = k_BT/6πηr_p. For ethanol: η=1.2 mPa·s, K=0.67 mm²/s, T=500K (combustion). At φ=0.1% w/w ≈ 0.05% v/v: n = φV_d/V_p = 0.0005*(4π(100μm)³/3)/(π(25nm)³*4/3) ≈ 3×10⁸ particles. L_m ≈ (4π(100μm)³/(3×3×10⁸))^(1/3) ≈ 1.5 μm. D_p = (1.38×10⁻²³J/K)(500K)/(6π×1.2×10⁻³Pa·s×25nm) ≈ 4×10⁻¹² m²/s. τ_particle = (1.5μm)²/(2×4×10⁻¹² m²/s) ≈ 0.28 ms. τ_d = (200μm)²/0.67 mm²/s ≈ 60 ms. Thus CR ≈ 0.0047 << 1, indicating particles migrate much faster than droplet regresses (τ_particle/τ_d ≈ 0.5%), enabling uniform heat transfer enhancement.
