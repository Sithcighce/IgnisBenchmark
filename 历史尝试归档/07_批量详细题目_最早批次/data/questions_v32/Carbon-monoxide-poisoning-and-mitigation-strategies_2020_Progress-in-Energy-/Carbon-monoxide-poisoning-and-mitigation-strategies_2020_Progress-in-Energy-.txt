Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have received much attention due to their high power
density, good start-stop capabilities and high gravimetric and volumetric power density compared with
other fuel cells. However, certain technological challenges persist, which include the fact that conven-
tional anode electrocatalysts are poisoned by low levels (few ppm) of carbon monoxide (CO). This review
considers the mechanism of CO poisoning and the effects that it has on the PEMFC performance. The
key parameters affecting CO poisoning are identified and methods used to mitigate the effects are dis-
cussed. These mitigation strategies are divided into three groups according to the means by which the
technologies are applied: pre-treatment of reformate, on board removal of CO and in operando mitigation
strategies.

1. Introduction

Fuel cells are considered a highly efficient energy source, with
the advantage of no carbon dioxide emissions at the point of use,
when operating on  hydrogen fuel.  They  can  contribute  to  meet-
ing global energy demands while overcoming environmental chal-
lenges. They could potentially replace internal combustion engines,
and  in  some  cases  energy  storage  devices  such  as  batteries  [1] .
Polymer  electrolyte  membrane  fuel  cells  (PEMFCs)  in  particular
have received much attention as they have high power density and
fast start-up and response times [2] . For these reasons, they are the
most commonly used fuel cell for automotive applications [3,4] . In
2017, PEMFCs accounted for 75% of the total megawatts [235] .

The most important challenges that this technology faces in or-
der to increase its presence in the market are cost, performance
and  durability  [5] .  A  range  of  physical-chemical  phenomena  can
adversely affect performance, including water management issues
(membrane humidification, cathode flooding, freezing, drying phe-
nomena), adsorption of contaminants, degradation and poisoning
of electrocatalysts, etc. Some of these processes are reversible, oth-
ers are irreversible and lead to long-term degradation [6] . Contam-
2 S) and
inants such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulphide (H
ammonia (NH
3 ) [7] are known to be particularly pernicious and af-
fect performance, even when present in trace (ppm) amounts [8] .
This work focuses on the effect of carbon monoxide on PEMFCs,
which is usually introduced by the hydrogen fuel supply. The Inter-
national Organization for Standardization (ISO) state that the lim-
its for vehicle and stationary applications are 0.2 and 10 ppm CO
respectively [9,10] but methods of mitigating CO poisoning can po-
tentially allow practical operation at higher levels. The purpose of
this  review  is  to  provide  a  general  overview  of  the  studies  that
have looked at the mechanism of CO poisoning and in particular,
to examine the mitigation strategies proposed.

2. Fundamental understanding

ized  technologies  are  auto-thermal  reforming  (ATR)  of  methane
and coal gasification. Some predictions expect this to be the most
economical path to hydrogen production for decades to come [11] .
While this may be a convenient and economical route, the hydro-
gen produces is not necessarily conducive to direct use in PEMFC.
The reformate obtained after a first stage of clean-up through the
water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction, has a typical composition of 40 to
2 , 1 to 2% CO, plus small quantities of inert
70% H
gases such as water vapour and nitrogen, and sulphur impurities.
It is also possible to find ammonia in the reformate at ppm levels,
if it is used as a gas tracer along the distribution system [12] .

2 , 15 to 25% CO

Multiple purification stages are needed to reduce the CO con-
centration to levels conducive to PEMFC operation after the gener-
ation of hydrogen from fossil fuels. Typically, the concentration of
CO obtained after these processes is of the order of 10 ppm. Purifi-
cation methods include adsorption, membrane separation, scrub-
bers, and selective reaction. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is the
most common technology, accounting for 85% of the hydrogen pu-
rified [11] . CO preferential oxidation (PROX) and the CO-selective
methanation (SMET) are receiving increasing interest and will be
discussed in Section 3.1 [13] . These clean-up stages can require an
order of magnitude higher plant volume than that for the reformer
and fuel cell stack combined [14] , increasing the costs and parasitic
power demand. It has been estimated that in large-scale chemical
plants, separation and purification of hydrogen can account for be-
tween 50 and 80% of the total capital investment [15] . The deploy-
ment of fuel cells is hindered as a consequence [16] .

The  reformation  of  liquid  and  renewable  biomass  materials,
such as methanol and ethanol, is being studied as an alternative
to  natural  gas,  especially  due  to  the  advantage  of  liquid  storage
and transport compared to gases [12,17] . Electrolysis of water is be-
ing extensively developed as a route to hydrogen from ‘green’ elec-
tricity [234] . Other sources include photosynthetic microorganisms,
the  photoelectrolysis  of  water,  the  thermal  dissociation  of  water
and thermochemical cycles [18] .

2.2. Mechanisms of CO poisoning

Around  48%  of  worldwide  hydrogen  production  comes  from
steam  methane  reforming  (SMR)  of  natural  gas,  or  other  hydro-
carbons [234] . This process delivers high conversion to hydrogen
at a low cost and high efficiency. Other mature and commercial-

the  anode  through  the  Tafel  [19] ,  Heyrovsky  [20]  and  Volmer
[21] mechanisms. The HOR usually takes place through the Tafel-
Volmer, and/or the Heyrovsky-Volmer routes [22] , although alter-
native routes are under study [23] .

In  the  early  studies  about  HOR,  it  was  reported  that  the  re-
action was insensitive to surface structure [24] . More recently, it
was found that the reaction rate is dependent on the surface struc-
ture and the electrolyte [22,25] . For the most common anode cat-
alyst,  platinum,  the  rate  of  hydrogen  oxidation  depends  on  the
crystal orientation following the trend Pt(110) > Pt(100) > Pt(111).
The Tafel reaction is the rate-limiting step in the case of Pt(110)

CO competes with hydrogen for the active sites on the platinum
under normal anode operating potentials [28] . CO adsorbs on the
Pt surface more easily than H
2 (heat of adsorption of CO on Pt is
134 kJ mol −1 , and for H
2 is 87.9 kJ mol −1 ) [29] . The available sur-
face for the HOR is reduced while the CO accumulates on the plat-
inum surface [30] . The magnitude of the surface covered by CO is
determined by the CO adsorption and/or re-adsorption (Reactions
Eq. 4 and 5 ) [31] , the electroreduction of CO
2 , and the CO removal
through oxidation (Reaction Eq. 6 ), which occurs through the re-
actant pair mechanism [32] . These processes compete with each
other, depending on conditions [33] .

CO concentrations (O) 10 ppm; ( (cid:2)) 20 ppm; ( (cid:2)) 40 ppm; ( ●) 100 ppm. Reproduced
with permission [34] .

Fig. 1 also shows that different adsorption modes exist for CO
on Pt: linear or on-top bonding, bridge or twofold site bonding and
hollow or threefold site bonding. The type of CO adsorption site
bonding is related to the surface structure at saturation coverage
[25] . It has been shown that at less than 50% surface coverage, the
bridge-bonded dominates. The linear bonded type is dominant at
higher surface coverage ( Fig. 2 ) [34] .

The increasing coverage of CO on the platinum surface reaches
a threshold where the electro-oxidation of CO takes place. For pure
platinum electrodes, it takes place above ≈ 0.6 V (vs. RHE) [35] . At
25  °C,  the  CO  contained  in  1%  CO/hydrogen  mixture  blocks  98%
of the active sites [36] . Fig. 3 presents the cyclic voltammograms
obtained for the CO stripping on a Pt/C catalyst at 23 °C [33] .

2.2.2. “Self-oxidation” or sustained potential oscillations

Murthy et al. first reported the oscillatory behaviour of the po-
tential in an operando cell exposed to CO/H
2 at a constant current
[37] .  Zhang  and  Datta  subsequently  reported  more  details  about
this behaviour [38,39] . These oscillations were also presented by
Hanke-Rauschenbach  et  al.  as  part  of  a  review  of  nonlinear  dy-

over the decrease of the flow rate at a constant current [45] . This
behaviour was corroborated in spatio-temporal models [46,47] and
current distribution measurements [48] .

Lu et al. determined that the time-averaged power density ob-
tained with self-sustained oscillations under galvanostatic opera-
tion is higher than when in potentiostatic mode. The measurement
of the concentration of CO at the anode outlet under constant cur-
rent contributed to confirm the electrochemical oxidation of CO,
which  is  responsible  for  the  difference  in  the  power  output  be-
tween  the  two  operation  modes  [44] .  Subsequently,  Lopes  et  al.
showed  the  production  of  CO
2  during  the  oscillatory  behaviour,
and presented a model that predicts the coverage of the different
species in the electrode surface [49] .

2.3. Effects of CO on the performance of PEMFCs

2.3.1. Effect of operating parameters

CO poisoning affects PEM fuel cell performance in three major
ways: the electrode kinetics, conductivity and mass transfer [12] .
Blocking of catalyst active sites affects the kinetics of electrocatal-
ysis [29] . Fig. 5 summarises the effects of concentration, exposure
time, temperature, anode flow rate and operating pressure, from a
range of experimental investigations.

Early studies show that the effect of CO becomes more severe
on Pt electrocatalysts when the CO concentration and time are in-
creased  [50–52] .  At  higher  concentrations  (typically  higher  than
100 ppm CO), two slopes are observed in the polarization curves.
The slope at lower current densities is due to the adsorption and
oxidation of hydrogen and CO at the anode. At higher current den-
sities, the potential at the anode reaches values at which the ad-
2 and the reaction rates for hydrogen
sorbed CO is oxidized to CO
adsorption and oxidation are increased [50] . Over time, as the ad-
sorption of CO increases, the performance decreases significantly
until it reaches a steady state [50,242] .

Temperature has a strong impact on the effect of CO poison-
ing. The adsorption of CO is favoured at lower temperatures, block-
ing the oxidation of H
2 [53] . Zamel et al. reported that at higher
temperatures the poisoning occurs faster, resulting in a more rapid
performance drop towards the steady state [54] . Dhar et al. found
that the CO coverage follows a Temkin isotherm at a fixed current
density, which can be written in the form [53] :

where θ CO  is the CO coverage, (cid:2)G o 0  is the standard free energy
of  adsorption, r is the  interaction parameter,  and H  Henry’s law
constant for CO solubility (atm L mol −1 ). This relation shows that
the increase in the anodic polarization is due to the replacement of
H
2 molecules by CO. The interaction parameter is highly dependent
on the catalyst structure [53] . As the anode flow is increased, the
voltage of the cell decreases due to the increased total amount of
CO that is exposed to the anode. Additionally, the time needed to
reach steady-state is diminished as the flow rate is increased.

Another important operating parameter is the cathode pressure.
Oxygen permeates through the membrane from the cathode to an-
ode and contributes to the oxidation of the CO into CO
2 [55] . Fig.
5 (d) shows the combined effect of the concentration of CO and the
operating pressure [56] .

The influence of the anode feed relative humidity has also been
studied. Iorio et al. determined that the CO-stripping potential of
Pt/C and PtRu/C electrodes decreased at higher water vapor pres-
sure [57] . In high-temperature PEMFCs (HT-PEMFCs), an increase in
the humidity reduces the anodic overpotential. This is due to the
ads groups, which are consumed in the oxida-
presence of the OH
tion of CO ( Fig. 5 (f)) [58–60] .

namics  of  fuel  cells  [40] .  As  the  CO  accumulates  at  the  surface
of the catalyst, the anodic overpotential increases. The higher po-
tential attained allows the oxidation of the CO (as shown in Fig.
3 ), and the cell voltage increases (anode overpotential decreases)
to the original value [41] , with the process of CO build-up occur-
ring again, this cycle leading to anode overpotential oscillations, as
shown in Fig. 4 for different operating conditions.

This  behaviour  was  first  observed  in  PtRu/C  [37–39] ,  Pd-Pt/C
and Pd/C [42] before being studied in Pt/C systems [43] . The na-
ture of the oscillations depends on the temperature, current den-
sity, anode CO concentration and flow rate. Generally, the higher
the concentration of CO and anodic flow rate are, the shorter the
periods are. The period decreases with increasing current density
or temperature [38,44] .

The dynamics of the oscillations were studied by Mota et al.
at different current and anode flow rates, observing periodic and
nonperiodic states. The transition from ‘period-1’ to ‘period-2’ and
chaotic states occurs with an increase in current at a fixed flow, or

2.3.2.1. The combined effect of CO and CO 2 .  The presence of CO
the anode inlet is closely related to the CO poisoning, as the re-
verse water-shift reaction (RWGS) produces CO in the presence of
platinum [33,60,62–65] . 10 0–20 0 ppm CO can be reached with a

Due  to  the  endothermic  nature  of  the  RWGS,  the  pro-
duction  of  CO  is  increased  at  higher  temperatures  [58,62] .
As  incrementing  the  temperature  also  favours  the  CO  electro-
oxidation,  the  degradation  of  cells  is  determined  by  the  ratio:

to this [60] . The humidity also has a direct impact on RWGS CO
2
poisoning, as at higher water content the CO produced is oxidised
through the water gas shift reaction [58,60,62] .

The combined effect of CO and CO

2 in the anode inlet has been
studied. As the adsorption of CO is much faster than the RWGS, the
polarization due to the presence of CO in the anode inlet is higher
than for CO
2 . This distinction is more evident at high concentra-
tions of CO, as less Pt-H sites are available for the RWGS reaction
to take place [33,62,66] . Fig. 6 shows the combined effect of CO
and CO

2 on an HT-PEMFC [58] .

2.3.2.2. The  combined  effect  of  CO  and  H 2 S.  Rockward  et  al.  pre-
sented the contamination of multiple components in a PEMFC. The
combination  of  H
2 S  and  CO,  in  particular,  was  studied  through
cyclic voltammetry. It was observed that in the presence of both
components,  the  CO  is  displaced  from  the  surface  ( Fig.  7 ).  The
longer the exposure time, the more the CO is displaced and the
2 S is adsorbed [67] . This phenomenon could be explained by the
H
H
2 S affinity for platinum, which is higher than for CO. S-species
are a common component in the reformate, capable of irreversible
effects in the cells [68] .

2.3.2.3. The combined effect of CO, H 2 S, formic acid, benzene and am-
monia.  Wang  et  al.  evaluated  the  additive  effect  of  other  com-
mon  impurities  in  hydrogen.  The  effect  of  0.2  ppm  CO,  4  ppb
H
2 S,  0.2  ppm  formic  acid,  2  ppm  benzene  and  0.1  ppm  ammo-
nia on hydrogen was evaluated individually, without any signifi-
cant  effect  on  the  performance  of  the  cell.  The  mixture  did  not
have  a  major  impact  either.  However,  when  the  concentration
of  the  contaminants  was  increased  five  times,  the  effects  were
discernible  ( Fig.  8 ).  Subsequently,  cell  performance  almost  fully
recovered,  but  a  permanent  degradation  of  the  membrane  was
observed [69] .

that the effects on the performance were similar to the exposure

2.4. Contamination of the cathode

In  the  presence  of  CO  at  the  anode,  it  can  pass  through  the
membrane and be absorbed on the cathode catalyst, especially on
the sites closer to the membrane. Cyclic voltammetry was used to

Other studies have focused on the effect of CO in the anode,
on the corrosion of carbon supports in the cathode.  Parry  et al.
showed  through  XPS  a  decrease  in  the  corrosion  of  the  carbon
catalyst-support in the cathode in the presence of 5 ppm CO in
the anode. This effect was explained by the reduction of the re-
verse proton pumping from the cathode to the anode [29,81] . In an
HT-PEMFC, CO in the range of 0.1–1.3% was added directly to the
cathode to evaluate the corrosion rate of carbon-supports. A com-
2 and H
petition between CO, O
4 at the three-phase boundaries
3 PO
was shown. The H
4 molecules that hamper the performance of
3 PO
the cell, are replaced by CO. Hence, a low CO content in the cath-
ode side increases the cell potential. Higher concentrations of CO
are detrimental due to extensive blockage of the active sites [82] .

prove the presence of CO on the cathode. The potentials of both
electrodes are affected simultaneously ( Fig. 10 ). Different parame-
ters affect the CO crossover, including the porosity, levels of hu-
midification and the thickness of the membrane, and the pressure
difference between anode and cathode. A fully hydrated membrane
reduces CO crossover [74,75] .

Both electrodes showed a drop in the ECSA [76,77] . The active area
loss  in  both  electrodes  has  been  confirmed  in  long-term  (about
10 0 0 h) experiments under cyclic exposure to CO [78] , and under
different load cycling protocols [79] .

2 /H

Wagner et al. studied the poisoning of CO through electrochem-
ical impedance spectroscopy, and showed an increase on both elec-
trodes  at  constant  cell  voltage.  At  constant  current,  the  increase
on the impedance resulted mainly by the anode contribution [80] .
This information was complemented by the spatial electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy results, where the increase on both elec-
trodes was observed at constant current in the presence of 2 ppm
CO ( Section 2.6.3 ) [76,77] .

Fewer  studies  have  considered  the  long-term  degradation  of
PEM  fuel  cells  when  exposed  to  CO.  Angelo  et  al.  reported  the
loss in the active area of both electrodes over 10 0 0 h with repet-
itive exposure to 2 ppm CO, showing the negative impacts of CO
in the performance and durability of the cell ( Fig. 11 ) [78] . Pro-
fatilova et al. studied load cycling protocols in the presence of CO
for about 10 0 0 h, and confirmed the irreversible losses in the ac-
tive surface of the electrodes. The main accelerating aging param-
eters were also identified, which include the CO concentration, the
amplitude and frequency of current load cycling, and the applica-
tion of intermediate electrochemical in situ characterizations [79] .
Franco et al. examined the effects of 5 ppm CO on an MEA after
600 h under two different current-cycle protocols, representative
of transport applications:
- Protocol 0/ I max : alternation of 30 min at 0 A cm −2 and 30 min

- Protocol I

min / I max : alternation of 30 min at 0.108 A cm −2  and

at 0.54 A cm −2

30 min at 0.54 A cm −2

Fig. 12 presents the results of both tests. It was found that the
current-cycle operating conditions are strongly related to the ef-
fects of CO on the cell potential degradation rate. Under the 0/ I max
protocol, the performance of the cell is degraded in the presence of
CO in the short and long-term, mainly because of the contamina-
tion of CO that blocked the anode catalytic sites. It is not the case
for the long-term degradation under I
min / I max , where it is lower un-
2 + CO than with pure H
2 . As the fuel starvation is higher un-
der H
min / I max protocol, the concentration of the permeated O
der the I
2
in the anode is accumulated. The O
2 reacts with the CO, reducing
both the poisoning and the carbon-support corrosion on the cath-
ode. The corrosion decreases the cathode thickness and the catalyst
active surface area, degrading the performance of the cell. Thus,
the CO poisoning in the anode can be used as a tool to mitigate
the cathode catalyst-support corrosion and increase the durability
of the MEA [83] . The finding was confirmed through XPS quanti-
tative characterizations by Parry et al. , that observed the decrease
of the reverse proton pumping effect between the cathode and the
anode in the presence of CO [81] .

More recently, Chandesris et al. studied the degradation hetero-
geneities in a stack exposed to reformate. It was found that the
cathode outlet aged more severely than the inlet, and that the an-
ode outlet would lose more CO tolerance [84] .

2.6. Spatial distribution of the CO adsorption

2.6.1. Distribution in a single channel

The distribution ‘pattern’ of CO poisoning across the extent of
the anode was studied by Brett et al. . Localised CO stripping and
adsorption transients were used to determine the distribution of
CO  to  either  side  of  a  single  linear  flow  channel  ( Fig.  13 ).  Low

tween each other. The dispersion of CO is a result of these two
mechanisms [85] . The results obtained in this study helped to de-
velop a model able to predict the effects of transient poisoning,
which are present, in particular, during the system start-up, in the
distribution of the CO adsorption. A good agreement with the ex-
perimental results was observed [86] .

2.6.2. Current density distribution

Different authors proposed the use of segmented cells to evalu-
ate the current distribution across a cell and assess the effect of CO
poisoning  [65,76,77,87,88] .  It  was  found  that  under  galvanostatic
control and in the absence of self-sustained potential oscillations
(usually low concentrations of CO), the distribution of the surface
coverage by CO was uneven as the adsorption of CO is faster at the
inlet than at the outlet ( Fig. 14 (a)) [76,77,87,88] . In the presence of
potential oscillations, where the hydroxides formed at the surface
of the catalyst assist the CO oxidation, the effects of the otherwise
uneven distribution are diminished ( Fig. 14 (b)) [65] . In potentio-
static mode, the anodic potential is maintained below the CO oxi-
dation potential so that no substantial CO removal takes place [65] .
More research is needed to understand the mechanisms occurring
under potentiostatic control as Tingelof et al. reported an uneven
distribution of the poisoning [65] , contrary to Boaventura et al. that
described an even distribution [88] .

flow rates result in anisotropic distributions of CO away from the
channel, and higher flows present a more uniform distribution. The
advection along the channel and the lateral diffusion compete be-

vanostatic operation, a pseudo-inductive behaviour is observed in
the low frequencies region ( < 3 Hz) [91,92,80] . And, under poten-
tiostatic control this behaviour is observed at a critical potential,
which is coincident with the ignition potential and is dependant
on the catalyst in use [93] .

under galvanstatic control the changes in the EIS spectra were due
exclusively  to  anode  contributions  [80,91] .  In  this  study,  it  was
found  that  there  is  an  increase  of  charge  transfer  resistance  for
both, the anode and the cathode, confirming that the CO also im-
pacts  the  electrochemical  processes  in  the  cathode.  Additionally,
the pseudo-inductive behaviour at low frequency was observed in
the  first  segments  of  the  cell  (more  severely  contaminated)  for
2 systems, which was attributed to the surface re-

laxation of the anode, related to the competitive electrochemical
2 and CO. The electric equivalent circuit was adapted
oxidation of H
to include this contribution. For this concentration, the H

eration did not present this behaviour due to the predominance of
the direct chemical oxidation of CO by the diffused O

3. Mitigation strategies

The development and optimization of mitigation strategies that
could  enhance  the  CO  tolerance  of  fuel  cells  is  a  major  area  of
interest. Various mitigation strategies have been proposed in or-
der  to  reduce  the  CO  content  after  the  first  stage  of  purifica-
tion  is  achieved  by  the  WGS  reaction.  The  CO  concentration  af-
ter  this  process  reaches  up  to  3%  [12] .  According  to  the  means
by which the technologies are applied, these can be divided into
three groups: (i) the pre-treatment of reformate; (ii) ‘on board’ CO
removal, and (iii) in-operando strategies ( Fig. 16 ). Their develop-
ment  follows  different  approaches  that  include  the  development
of new materials, the supply of feed gases, variation on the oper-
ating conditions, or the modification of the MEA. An overview of
the proposed techniques is presented in this section. The choice
of the technique will depend on the specific requirements of the
system.

3.1. Pre-treatment of reformate

The processes described here are well-established on-site tech-
nologies. Although there are more options available for the sep-
aration of hydrogen, here the focus is on the removal of CO and

2.6.3. Segmented electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)

Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  has  been  used
to  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  CO  poisoning.  It  constitutes  an
effective  diagnostic  technique  to  identify  the  contamination  and
to  study  the  mechanisms  involved  in  it  [89,90] .  Considering  the
changing nature of the contamination over time, new methods for
the interpretation have been developed. These techniques include
real-time drift compensation, time course interpolation and Z-HIT
refinement [80,91] . During the contamination, an increase in the

tained after these processes is 10 ppm CO. There are different cat-
egories, including adsorption, membranes, scrubbers, and selective

and 99.999% [94–96] . The reformate is placed in a packed column

Once the impurities have been adsorbed, the pressure is lowered
to regenerate and purge the column. Typically, at least three cyclic
columns are operated simultaneously [7] .

PSA presents several advantages. It is fast and allows the con-
tinuous purification of hydrogen without disrupting the regenera-
tion process of the adsorbents, which are used several times before
losing  their  adsorptive  capacity.  Additionally,  the  hydrogen  pro-
duced is at the same pressure as the feed [103] . The drawbacks
are  the  need  for  high  pressure  (between  5  and  10  atm)  in  or-
der to achieve high removal efficiencies, and the process generally
requires  a  complex  operation  under  a  series  of  sequential,  non-
isothermal,  non-isobaric  and  non-steady-state  process  steps.  The
main areas of research for this process are the hydrogen recovery
at high purity, the decrease in the amount of adsorbent needed
and the hardware costs [11] .

3.1.2. Preferential oxidation (PROX)

In this process, air is supplied to the reformate gas in the pres-

ence of a catalyst. The main reaction is [13] :

ture, as well as at low temperature to avoid the reverse water-gas

3.1.3. Selective methanation (SMET)

The  target  reaction  for  the  selective  methanation  (SMET)  is

The process reduces the CO content to 50–100 ppm [97] . The
main advantage of this process is that a small amount of CO reacts
2 . The process can operate
in the presence of large quantities of H
on a continuous basis. Additionally, as the oxygen necessary for the
reaction comes from air, low energy is required for its provision
and the process can operate at atmospheric pressure [11] . How-
ever, this process presents several challenges: the need to control
2 /CO and the risk of spontaneous explo-
the concentration ratio O
sion due to the gas mixture. The system is bulky and complex as a
consequence [13] . Another problem is the consumption of hydro-
gen by the reaction (11) [97] .

The catalysts developed are mainly supported Ru and Pt-based
alloy catalysts. The advances have been focused on the develop-

SMET is a promising technology as there is no need for another
gas for the reaction to take place [98] . Additionally, the process is
free of nitrogen dilution, avoiding the danger of explosion and the
need for advanced controls that PROX requires. The primary chal-
lenge that this process presents is the low performance of the Ni-

the catalytic performance for the SMET, and emphasised the focus

in the presence of an excess of CO

3.1.4. Membranes separation
3.1.4.1. Pd-based  membranes.  Over  the  past  50  years,  membrane
separation has received much attention for different applications,
including micro-filtration of bacteria to reverse osmosis for water
clean-up [95,104] . There are several membranes for hydrogen sep-
aration.  Considering  the  material  they  are  made  of,  they  can  be
divided into different categories: polymer, metallic, carbon and ce-
ramic [95,99,105] . Another classification would be between porous
and  dense.  For  the  hydrogen  separation,  porous  membranes  use
the molecular sieving as a primary mechanism, while the dense
membranes utilise solution diffusion [95] .

Palladium  and  its  alloys  have  been  the  most  studied  mem-
branes for hydrogen separation, due to palladium’s high catalytic
activity  for  hydrogen  dissociation  and  its  high  permeability  for
diffusion  of  hydrogen  atoms  [98,99] .  Considering  that  palladium
membranes  are  susceptible  to  embrittlement  below  300  °C,  and
their tendency to suffer sulphur and carbon monoxide poisoning
at low temperatures, Pd-based alloy membranes have been devel-
oped to overcome these effects and to enhance the hydrogen per-
meability. Fig. 17 presents the processes involved using this class
of membrane [95] which can achieve a purity of up to 99.9999%
H

2 [94] .

However, not all the Pd-alloy membranes are resistant to the
presence of certain species, in particular, H
2 S hinders the perme-
ability of hydrogen [99,105] . The costs are another disadvantage of
Pd-based membranes. Thin metallic membranes have been devel-
oped to reduce costs and increase the hydrogen flux [105] . Due to
the reduced thickness, membranes are deposited onto substrates
to provide mechanical support. Different materials have been pro-
posed, from which porous stainless steel (PSS) has proved to pro-
vide strength, robustness, similar thermal expansion and ease of
welding and sealing [95] . Most Pd-based membrane research is fo-
cused on optimizing the alloys and creating new fabrication meth-
ods [99] .

3.1.4.2. Two-dimensional  membranes.  Two-dimensional  materials
have  emerged  in  the  development  of  membranes  due  to  their
high  selectivity  and  permeability.  Highly  specific  separations  are
achieved under high flux rates [100] . In the case of graphene-based
membranes, produced from graphene, graphene oxide and chem-
ically  converted  graphene  materials,  three  main  types  of  mem-
branes  exist  according  to  their  microstructure  ( Fig.  18 ):  porous
graphene layer, assembled graphene laminates and graphene-based
composite [106] . The three types of membranes have been consid-

ered for the purification of H

few  examples  are  the  two-dimensional  polyphenylene  [107] ,  the
PG-ES1 [108] and the nitrogen-substituted porous graphene mono-
layers 3N-PG and 6N-PG [109] .

Controlling  graphene  with  specific  pore  sizes  and  homoge-
neous distribution is a challenge, hence the interest in other two-
dimensional  carbon  allotropes  with  uniformly  distributed  pores
[101] .  Among  them  is  graphdiyne  [110] ,  whose  framework  is
formed by hexagonal carbon ribs linked by diacetylene [111] . For
2 , several theoretical studies have evaluated
the separation of CO/H
the  properties  of  the  elemental  graphdiyne  [112,113] ,  while  oth-
ers  have  modified  the  structure  to  enhance  the  purification  ca-
pabilities in the cases of nitrogen modified graphdiyne [114] and
charge-modulated graphdiyne [115] . Other two-dimensional mem-
2  separation  include  the  rhom-
branes  under  study  for  the  CO/H
bic  graphyne  [116] ,  the  g-C
4  [117]  monolay-
ers, the strain-controlled nanoporous graphenylene [118] and the
inorganic graphenylene [119] , among others. While the predicted
properties of these materials are promising for the purification of
H
2 , their preparation and characterisation is limited. An advantage

pared to other mitigation strategies would be the removal of other

3.1.5. Metal hydride (MH) purification

Metal  hydrides  (MH)  are  one  of  the  most  promising  materi-
als for the storage of hydrogen due to their applicability in sta-
tionary, mobile and portable applications, their efficiency and safe
use [120] . Since the 1970s, the use of metal hydrides has been ex-
tended for hydrogen separation and purification [102] . The mecha-
nism is based on the selective adsorption of molecular hydrogen
on  the  metal  or  alloy  surface  under  certain  conditions  of  tem-
perature  and  pressure.  The  hydrogen  is  decomposed  into  atoms,
forming a solid solution MH x , followed by formation of the metal
hydride  MH y .  The  hydrogen  is  stored,  which  constitutes  one  of
the main advantages of the system. When desorbed, the impurity
gases are purged first [236] . The most deployed MH for separation
and purification of hydrogen are the AB5-type [102] .

Among the advantages that these devices present are their sim-
plicity, low energy consumption, relatively safe use and straightfor-
ward operation, as well as the high purity reached (up to 99.999%)
[236] . Major challenges include the impact of the composition of
the fed gas on the final composition, the rate of absorption and the
long-term stability. The most severe contaminants are CO, O
2 O
and sulphur-containing compounds [236,102] . Hence, MHs have a
serious  limitation  regarding  removal  of  CO.  However,  Modibane
et  al.  reported substrates  La(Ni, Co,  Mn,  Al)
5  with stable perfor-
2  and 100 ppm CO
mances over gas mixtures containing 10% CO
[102] . Concurrently, Miura et al. proposed a system for start and
stop operations, composed by several units connected in series. In
the first one, the CO is removed by an adsorbent, while the hy-
drogen was stored in the following units. The process is called CO
adsorption metal hydride intermediate buffer (COA-MIB), and 83%

of hydrogen recovery was achieved after one month of operation.
Fig. 19 presents the operation of the COA-MIB [121,122] , and com-
mon AB5-type alloys [102] .

3.1.6. Cryogenic distillation

The cryogenic  distillation or partial condensation is based on
the difference in volatility of the components on the gas stream
[234,123] . The process is performed at low temperatures at which
the  impurities  condense,  while  the  hydrogen  remains  in  the
gaseous phase due to its low boiling point ( −252.9 °C). The effi-
ciency of the process depends on the operating temperature and
pressure, and the composition of the feed [96] . This process has
been  used  for  the  separation  of  the  different  hydrogen  isotopes
[234] . The separation is highly energy intensive and costly. An ad-
ditional  disadvantage  is  the  limited  purity  that  is  reached  com-
pared to other processes, which typically reaches ~99% [95] .

3.2. On-board removal of CO

In recent years, some on-board hydrogen purification technolo-
gies have emerged. All of them, except for the separation by mem-
branes, present a structure similar to PEMFCs; however, their oper-
ation is focused on the purification of the stream, and not the gen-
eration of energy. An external power supply is required, and they
are placed in-line before the fuel cell stack. A common advantage
is the generation of power, or in particular cases, the consump-
tion of almost null power. Although promising results have been
obtained, the optimization of these technologies is vital to be able
to compete with the conventional in-site purification processes. A
summary of these technologies is presented in Table 2 .

3.2.1. Electrochemical preferential oxidation (ECPrOx)

Electrochemical preferential oxidation (ECPrOx) has been pro-
posed as an alternative to conventional PrOx [97] . The structure of
the ECPrOx units is similar to that of the PEMFC. The difference
is the operation, which is based on the spontaneous potential os-
cillations the cells exhibit due to the exposure to CO under gal-
vanostatic control ( Section 2.2.2 ). The objective is to enhance the
adsorption of CO and its oxidation to CO
2 , so the concentration of
CO in the stream is reduced before entering the fuel cell. Fig. 20
shows how the system integrates the ECPrOx and PEMFC [97] .

The  advantages  of  the  ECPrOx  compared  to  PrOx  are  the  CO
removal without H
2 waste and the supplemental electrical power
produced. The ECPrOx can take place at room temperature, atmo-
spheric air pressure, and with no external humidification. A high
anode pressure facilitates the CO adsorption, lowering the concen-
tration of CO at the anode outlet. Moreover, the use of electrical
potential is used to enhance the electro-oxidation of CO. As the ef-
ficiency is increased at lower temperatures, a heat exchanger might
be needed prior to the ECPrOx unit [97] .

Hanke-Rauschenbach  studied  the  oscillatory  behaviour  of  po-
tential  using  the  model  presented  by  Zhang  et  Datta  as  a  base,

and compared the behaviour of two ECPrOx reactors with electri-
cal connections in series and in parallel [38,133] . It was concluded
that  the  CO  conversion is  improved in  the  series system  due  to
the independent oscillations of each unit. The units connected in
parallel oscillate simultaneously, affecting the performance of the
system [133] . This comparison is supported by the experimental
results obtained by Lu et al. [134] , and also by Heidebrecht et al.,
who presented a design approach for cascades of ECPrOx, using a
degrees-of-freedom analysis [135] .

3.2.2. Electrochemical filter

Lakshmanan et al. were the first to show how a PEMFC oper-
ating under pulse potential control could be used as a filter to re-
move CO from reformate [14] . In order to ensure constant opera-
tion, the system involves the use of two PEM fuel cells that alter-
nately cycle between CO adsorption and CO oxidation [124] . Fig. 21
shows how reformate enters the anode of the first cell (F1), which
is operated at open-circuit. The CO is adsorbed on the catalyst sur-
face,  effectively  filtering  the  CO  from  the  stream,  the  remaining
‘purified’ hydrogen-rich gas entering the second fuel cell. After a
switching time, when most of the catalyst surface is covered by
CO, the reformate enters into the second cell (F2 in the diagram).
A potential pulse is then applied to F1 that allows the oxidation of
CO [16,124,136] .

A fixed-bed adsorber model was used to optimise the switching
time and different operating conditions. It was possible to reduce
the concentration of CO from 10,0 0 0 ppm to 10 ppm at 25 °C, us-
ing a flow 100 cm 3 min −1 , a catalyst charge of 4 mg Pt cm −2 and
a switching time of 20 s. The potential for the CO oxidation was
0.7 V. A primary consideration to take into account is the volume
of the ‘filter’ to remove high concentrations of CO. For instance,
reducing the concentration of CO from 10,0 0 0 ppm to 10 ppm to
feed a cell operating at 1 A cm −2 , requires a filter cell almost ten
times the area of the fuel cell [16] .

3.2.3. Electrochemical hydrogen pumping (EHP)

Electrochemical  hydrogen  pumping  is  a  technology  originally
presented in the 1960s, with the main objective of purifying and
compressing hydrogen [137,138] . As shown in Fig. 22 , the mixed
stream enters the anode, where the hydrogen is oxidized. The pro-
tons ‘pumped’ to the cathode where pure and pressurized hydro-
gen is collected [139] .

The EHP can separate the hydrogen as long as the components
of the stream do not poison the catalyst, so that the technology
was not considered for the separation of CO [140] . The introduction
of EHP at high temperature PEMFC with phosphoric acid-doped PBI
membranes  ( Section  3.3.2 )  [125] ,  and  EHP  combined  with  other
techniques such as the current pulsing operation ( Section 3.3.10.1 )
[130] and the enhancement of the Electrochemical Water Gas Shift
(EWGS) [128,129] offered the possibility of CO mitigation at high
levels.

for the separation of CO ( Fig. 23 ), and demonstrated the fast dy-
namic response and the stability of the system [126] .

3.2.3.2. Electrochemical water gas shift (EWGS).  The Electrochemical
Water Gas Shift (EWGS) combines the separation of H
2 through the
EHP, and the electrochemical CO oxidation. In the case of the EWGS
at high temperatures (between 130 and 150 °C), PBI membranes
were used as the electrolyte. Both the EHP and the electrochem-
ical CO oxidation occur simultaneously at high current densities,
and with a feed containing high concentrations of CO and H
2 O. A
diagram of the processes involved, and a typical polarization curve,
are presented in Fig. 24 . Oettel et al. tested concentrations up to

its operation. Additionally, the use of a liquid electrolyte in order
to increase the CO adsorption capacity of the reactor was reported
[131] .

3.2.3.4. EWGS at ambient temperature.  A study on the separation
of H
2  in combination with the electro-oxidation of CO was pre-
sented by Huang et al.. The EHP operation was done at ambient
temperature,  until  the  complete  coverage  of  the  catalyst  by  CO.
The operation was then interrupted, and a fraction of the power
generated by the subsequent fuel cell was applied into the reactor
to operate as an electrolyser. The OH − molecules generated in the
anode contributed to the electro-oxidation of CO. The system re-
sponse showed that it could mitigate a stream containing 100 ppm
CO/H
2 . The process has the advantage of using the CO as a reduc-
2 from water. Other advantages
ing reagent to produce additional H
are the removal of other contaminants, that include hydrogen sul-
phide (H
2 ), and
2 S), carbonyl monosulfide (CS), carbon dioxide (CO
nitrogen oxide  (NO); and  inherently safe use  compared to  other
technologies  [131] . A  diagram showing the processes involved is

In recent years,  the  use  of  membranes has broadened to  the
3 -
on-board purification of hydrogen. Liu et al. presented an Al
4 membrane capable of removing CO from a stream
supported Si
2 . The separation occurred through a combina-
containing 1%CO/H
tion of chemisorption and physisorption processes, and the resul-
tant hydrogen fed the fuel cell operating on-line. The CO was dis-
posed through a bypass needle valve. With the membrane in place
and in the presence of CO, the decrease in power density was less
than 0.01 W cm −2 . An advantage of this technique is the low cost
and ease of fabrication of Si
4 , although more research is needed
for the understanding of the mechanisms in place, and to deter-
mine the efficiency of the membrane in the case of long exposures
to CO [132] . Another consideration is the need of a converter for
CO, as in this study it is directed to the exhaust.

3.3. In-operando mitigation strategies

Several  in  operando  techniques  have  been  developed  to  miti-
gate CO poisoning in PEMFCs; these follow a range of approaches
including the development of new materials, the variation of the
conditions of operation, the change of fuel cell design and/or the
addition of new components. In general, the objectives are to allow
operation of cells at a high concentration of CO (up to that deliv-
ered at the exit of a reformer), be of simple design and econom-
ically feasible. Of these approaches, the development of CO toler-
ant catalysts is the most examined, followed by air-bleeding and
high-temperature operation. Table 3 presents the advantages and
disadvantages of each approach.

3.3.1. CO tolerant electrocatalysts

The development of electrocatalysts is an area of significant re-
search for CO poisoning mitigation. Suitable catalysts for CO toler-
ance must exhibit high activity for the HOR and the lowest pos-
sible overpotential in the presence of CO [190] . It is necessary to
maximize  the  oxidation  of  CO,  and  reduce  the  adsorption  pro-
cesses  for  the  improvement  of  the  CO  tolerance  [190] .  This  has
been achieved by alloying Pt with Ru, for example. PtRu/C is con-
sidered as one of the most promising CO-tolerant electrocatalysts,
and is the most commercially available [191] .

The  bifunctional  and  the  electronic  mechanisms  are  well-
accepted  pathways  that  explain  the  increased  tolerance  to  CO.
These were first proposed from studies performed on PtRu cata-
lysts and then expanded to other systems. The electronic or ligand
effect considers the decrease of the Pt-CO bond strength by the
addition  of  the  additional  alloying  element.  The  platinum  prop-
erties are modified by the electron donation or back-donation of
ruthenium. The CO adsorption energy decreases reducing the CO
coverage [192,193] . The electronic modifications also affect the CO
oxidation reaction rate. At lower potentials, the electronic mecha-
nism predominates due to the diminishment of CO adsorption, and
at higher overpotentials, the bifunctional mechanism takes place
[190] .

The  bifunctional  mechanism  was  first  referred  to  PtRu  alloys
[194] , and occurs over the formation of oxygen-containing species,
such as OH, on oxophilic sites present on the second element at
lower  potentials  than  for  Pt,  allowing  electro-oxidation  of  CO  to
2 [192] . The mechanism between the adsorption of CO and the
CO
formation OH follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism

[190] :
Pt + CO → Pt − ( CO )

M + H 2 O → M − OH + e

Different electrocatalysts have been developed since. The struc-
tures are covered in several reviews [64,142,143,190,195–198] . Fig.
27 presents the different classes of Pt-based catalysts for fuel cells
[198] , although the non-platinum structures are of great interest
due to the scarcity and the high costs of platinum [199] . Some rep-
resentative examples from the vaste array of electro-catalysts are
presented next.

Ehteshami et al. compared the performance of a series of bi-
nary and ternary Pt-based catalysts ( Fig. 28 ) and studied the re-
lationship between the electronic properties of the catalysts and
their tolerance to CO and CO
2 . PtMo/C presented the highest CO
tolerance  due  to  the  formation  of  well-dispersed  oxy-hydroxides
on the surface and to the turn-over of the Mo (IV/VI) redox couple,
followed by PtCoMo/C, PtRuMo/C, PtRuPb/C, PtRu/C, PtCo/C, PtFe/C,
PtNi/C and Pt/C. Although PtCoMo/C presented a higher CO oxida-
tion onset potential than PtMo/C, this ternary electro-catalyst pre-
sented a higher tolerance to CO
2 by the added ligand effect due to
the presence of Co, making it more suitable for the operation with
reformate [199] .

Some features have a direct impact on the catalyst efficiency
and CO tolerance, including the type, composition and atomic ra-
tios of the added elements. The synthesis method is also an impor-
tant research area as the structure, morphology and size distribu-
tion of the catalysts rely on the process chosen [142] . For instance,
Narischat et al. evaluated the effect of different porous structures
of carbon support for Pt
3 catalysts. The supports were prepared
from resorcinol-formaldehyde carbon gels, varying the resorcinol to
catalyst ratio (R/C). The highest tolerance was found to be related
to the largest volume of mesoporous, due to a higher diffusivity.

A catalyst class of interest is the core-shell structures due to the
reduction of platinum utilisation. Some reports have also shown
them to be more stable and catalytically more active than the alloy

tolerance to 10 0 0 ppm CO/H

As for the development of non-platinum electro-catalysts, a va-
riety of tungsten carbide (WC) produced from different routes were
tested  in  the  presence  of  1%  CO/H
2  carbon  catalyst  in  half-cell
tests. The reduction in the current density due to the presence of
CO was less than 6%, showing the weak adsorption of CO in cat-
alyst sites [149] . Although these materials have shown a high CO
tolerance, they present a low activity for HOR and are not conve-
nient for commercial use [150] . More recently, Li et al. reported the
synthesis of Ir-V-Mo/C catalysts. The ternary 40%Ir-10%V-10%Mo/C
(in weight) presented a 26.4% higher power density than a conven-
tional 40%Pt/C catalyst in a H
2 /air system, and a superior tolerance
to 10 ppm CO/H
2 , due presumably to the bifunctional mechanism
[150] .

Despite the progress made in the electro-catalysts area, there
is room for improvement. At present, the research is concentrated
in the development of CO-tolerant electrocatalysts more active and
stable. For instance, the anode materials synthetized so far degrade
under fuel cell operating conditions, due to leach out of the incor-
porated ions [142] . In the case of PtRu alloys, the anodic dissolu-
tion of ruthenium is favourable at potentials of 0.5 V vs RHE, lead-
ing to the loss of catalytic activity. Moreover, the dissolved ruthe-
nium provokes the poisoning of the cathode due to its crossover,
and the deterioration of the membrane properties [145] .

3.3.2. High-temperature fuel cells

As mentioned, CO poisoning is very temperature dependent. At
higher temperatures, the hydrogen adsorption is less exothermic
than the CO adsorption, the H
2  adsorption is favoured at higher
temperatures, diminishing the coverage by CO and increasing the
H
2 oxidation rate. The development of polymer membranes capa-
ble of operating at elevated temperatures opened up the possibility
of high-temperature PEM fuel cells (HT-PEMFC) [152] . HT-PEMFCs
operate between 150 °C and 200 °C and are much more resistant
to CO poisoning than conventional PEMFCs operating < 80 °C. Fig.
29 presents the effects of the operation of HT-PEMFC at different
concentrations of CO.

Another characteristic of this operation is the simplification of
the water management problems that conventional PEMFC present.
As the water is present only as vapour above 100 °C, flooding is
not an issue. Nevertheless, the membrane is susceptible to lose ion
conductivity due to dehydration [152,153] . Additionally, a corrosion
mechanism can be activated due to the high operating tempera-
tures [159] .

Different  membranes  have  been  developed  for  high-
temperature  operation,  such  as  inorganic-organic  composite
membranes,  sulfonated  hydrocarbon  polymers  and  acid-base
polymer membranes. The acid-base polymer membrane polyben-
zimidazole  (PBI)  doped  with  phosphoric  acid  (PA)  has  received
much attention [153] . This membrane alone possesses a very low

structures [142] . Most recent studies on the CO tolerance of core-
shell catalysts include the synthesis of PtRu/PtNi/C with PtRu alloy
surface and PtNi alloy core. The PtRu/PtNi/C catalyst presented a
higher CO tolerance when compared to PtNi/C and PtNi-Ru/C in a
PEMFC cell test in the presence of 30 ppm CO/H

duced graphene oxide sheet, incorporated with gold and platinum
nanoparticles, presented by Isseroff et al. This material was applied

proton conductivity; however, the addition of PA increases it from
10 −9  ms cm −1  to 0.1 S cm −1  at 150 °C [202] . At the same time,
the addition of PA entails the blockage of the catalyst, especially
on the cathode, limiting the oxygen reduction [153] .

HT-PEMFCs allow the use of direct reformate, containing 3% of
CO [154] , and up to 5% of CO [152] . There is no need for other pro-
cesses such as PSA, PROX or SMET, obtaining a simpler and more
economical system ( Fig. 30 ) [153] . Additionally, it is possible to in-
tegrate HT-PEMFCs into the fuel processing unit by recovering the
heat  from  the  cells  and  using  it  to  service  system  requirements
[153,202,203] . Moreover, it is also possible to mitigate the contam-
ination by H
2 S through this technique [158] . Liu et al. presented
a comprehensive review of HT-PEMFCs for their use in auxiliary
power units (APU) [204] .

3.3.3. Oxidant bleeding

Oxidant  bleeding  leads  to  the  enhancement  of  the  oxida-
tion  of  CO  to  CO
2  through  low  levels  of  oxygen  or  oxygen-
evolving/containing  species,  such  as  air  or  hydrogen  peroxide.
Sugiyama et al. deducted the energy profile of the CO oxidation

by O
2  on Pt(111) surface, presented in Fig. 31 , where two path-
2 dissociation, and
ways for the CO
2 formation are shown: (i) via O
(ii) via the OC-COO complex. The rate determining step via the O
2
dissociation corresponds to the generation and desorption of CO
2
(second step), while via the OC-COO complex the formation of this
species is the rate determining step (first step) [205] .

This  strategy  was  first  introduced  by  Gottesfeld  and  Pafford
who demonstrated that a concentration of 2-5% O
2 in the an-
ode stream was enough to completely mitigate the effects of a con-
centration of 100 ppm CO at 80 °C [51] . The technique was quickly
deployed and became one of the most studied. The variations over
the introduction of the oxidant in the anode are presented next.

3.3.3.1. External bleeding.  The external oxidant bleeding technique
involves introducing the oxidant, usually air, into the fuel stream.
The oxygen is adsorbed onto CO-free Pt catalyst sites, and then the
surface reaction between Pt-CO and Pt-O takes place to form CO
2 .
This gas-phase catalytic oxidation reduces the CO coverage on the
catalyst surface and increases the hydrogen electro-oxidation ac-

ogy to optimize the amount of air bleed through the evaluation of
the distribution of the contamination over a novel segmented cell,
and the analysis of the CO conversion to CO
2 [163] . Hafttananian
et al. developed a model that apart from predicting the operation
and the poisoning of the cell, could enhance the oxygen bleed and
diminish oxygen / hydrogen consumption by 63% [208] . Another
study checked the long-term effects of this technique [209] .

3.3.3.2. H 2 O 2 in the anode humidifier.  The use of hydrogen peroxide
in the humidification of water was also evaluated [61,144,164] . The
2 is heterogeneously decomposed into active oxygen that con-
H
tributes to the oxidation of the adsorbed CO in the catalyst, having
the same effect as an air bleed [164] . Bellows et al. found that a
certain amount of H
2 is catalytically decomposed by interaction
with the metallic surfaces of the humidifier [144] . The approach
has certain safety advantages over air bleed; however, it presents
other disadvantages inherent to oxidant bleeding ( Section 3.3.3.1 ),
in particular the degradation of the membrane in the long term
2  [162] . In short-time operation the

2 in
the deionized water of a humidifier completely avoiding the detri-
mental effects of 100 ppm CO in the anode hydrogen feed [61] .

3.3.3.3. Internal air bled.  The carbon monoxide poisoning can also
be  mitigated  by  permeated  oxygen  coming  from  the  cathode,
which allows the heterogeneous oxidation of CO at the anode. This
process is known as internal air bleed [165] . Wang et al. studied its
effects on a Pt-Ru/C anode by increasing the cathode backpressure
and the use of ultra-thin membranes ( ≤25 μm) for a CO concen-
tration of 50 ppm [165] . Sapountzi et al. also reported an increase
in the Faradaic efficiency by 2.5 in the presence of 2400 ppm CO
(0.24% CO/12.82% CO
2 / 61.92% He) [140] . The
main disadvantage of this approach is that use of a thin membrane
can also lead to CO crossover from the anode to the cathode, which
can degrade the cathode electrocatalyst and decrease membrane
proton conductivity [30] . The formation of H
2 from the diffused
O
2 to the anode is also pernicious, as it provokes the degradation
of the membrane in the extended hours of operation [162] .

pates in the oxidation of CO [206] . The remaining oxygen chemi-
cally combusts with hydrogen [238] . Studies have summarized the
different experimental conditions under which the CO poisoning
has been evaluated [160,163] . Fig. 32 shows how current density is
affected by cell exposure to different levels of air bleeding [160] .

Cell potential losses due to CO poisoning can be mitigated by
this technique, and recently it has been proven that low concen-
trations of H
2 S can be mitigated through air bleeding [151] . How-
ever, there are significant drawbacks regarding anode lifetime due
to the temperature increase caused by internal hydrogen combus-
tion with oxygen, which is highly exothermic ( Eq. 18 ). The temper-
ature provokes the sintering of the catalyst that reduces the num-
ber of active sites [143] .

An additional drawback is the degradation of the membrane af-
ter extended periods of operation, due to the formation of hydro-
gen peroxide (H
2 ) [162] . Ralph et al. reported the appearance
of  pin-holes,  leading  to  cell  failure,  although  the  anode  lifetime
can be increased by reconfiguring the anode ( Section 3.3.4 ) [143] .
Other disadvantages of this technique are the inefficiency associ-
ated with consumption of hydrogen and the need for careful con-
trol of the air feed [184] .

Recent  studies  evaluated  the  effect  of  temperature  in  the  ef-
fect of air bleeding, showing a slower process at higher temper-
ature [207] . Another study includes the proposition of a methodol-

3.3.4. Reconfiguration of the anode

The modification of the anode structure has also been evalu-
ated. The different approaches followed are presented next. These
comprehend the inclusion of additional layers of different compo-
sition to the catalyst or diffusion layer, and/or the spread of new
particles in the diffusion layer. The research about these methods
is limited and certain concerns about their applicability, such as
durability and costs, remain unsolved. However, when these struc-
tures are used in conjunction with an oxidant bleeding, these avoid
the heating problems that degrade the performance of the cells in
the long term.

tion, followed by a Pt
50 layer by screen-printing. A third layer
(the inner layer) is composed of pure Pt and is prepared by direct-
printing on the membrane. This structure presents a better perfor-
mance in the presence of 50 ppm CO than a conventional Pt
50 -
Ru

50 screen printed on GDL [206] .
The  method  of  preparation  was  shown  to  affect  the  perfor-
mance.  The  sputter  deposition  technique  in  the  outer  layer  was
found to double the CO tolerance (200 ppm CO vs 100 ppm CO)
compared  to  conventional  ink-based  filters.  It  creates  more  sites
upon which CO can be oxidized, using 40% less of Ru (0.080 vs
0.21 mg cm −2 ). The different structures studied are presented in
Fig. 33 [168] . The most efficient structure corresponds to a sputter-
deposited Ru filter placed beside a Pt:Ru alloy ( Fig. 34 ) [168] .

3.3.4.1. Bilayer anode structure.  Composite electrodes with different
layers have been proposed by Johnson Matthey and Ballard Power
Systems [210] . As hydrogen diffuses faster than CO, the inner cat-
alyst layers of the composite electrodes have a higher loading of
platinum  to  sustain  the  hydrogen  oxidation  reaction  (HOR).  The
CO reacts in the outer layers, where bespoke CO oxidation cata-
lysts are used. The layers can be designed with different electro-
catalyst components, contents and pore distribution. This method
allows the total amount of catalyst used to be reduced without any
loss of performance [166,167] . The decrease in the anodic overpo-
tential was confirmed by a modeling study presented by Janssen
et al., where single layers and bilayer structures were compared
[169] .

Different  catalysts  layers  prepared  by  different  methods  have
been  studied.  Yu  et  al.  proposed  two  layers  of  catalysts;  a  hy-
drophilic Pt/C inner-layer (0.02 mg cm −2 Pt) prepared by the trans-
fer method [211] , and a PtRu/C (0.28 mg cm −2 Pt/Ru) outer-layer
composed  by  a  thin  carbon  cloth  [241] ,  to  mitigate  50  ppm  CO
[166] .  Another  proposition  was  to  use  an  outer  layer  composed
of two nano-Ru layers prepared by magnetron sputtering deposi-

An additional advantage of the bilayer structure is that it can
be  used  to  mitigate  CO
2  contamination  [169]  and  the  combined
use with air bleeding extends the lifetime of the cell, as shown
in Fig. 35 , where a reformate containing 70% H
2 , 25% CO
2
and 40 ppm CO was evaluated. 3% of air bleed was necessary to
maintain the cell performance [143] .

2 , 5% N

A  bilayer  structure  conformed  of  an  exterior  layer  of  PtMo
and  an  interior  layer  of  PtRu  was  studied  by  Ball  et  al.  The
PtMo/PtRu  electrode  was  tested  in  the  presence  of  concentra-
tions of CO as high as 50 0 0 ppm CO/H
2 , obtaining a good perfor-
mance, even in the absence of an air bleed. In spite of the quan-
tity of platinum used, the results obtained opened up the possi-
bility of reducing the system required for the purification of the
reformate [170,171] .

3.3.4.2. Refined diffusion layer.  Shi et al. placed Pt or Au particles
in the diffusion layer by impregnation, to enhance the oxidation
of CO with oxygen before the gas reaches the catalyst layer of the
anode. This structure can mitigate 100 ppm CO together with 2%
of oxygen bleed [172] . Santiago et al. studied the modification of
the diffusion layer, by applying filtering layers (Ru/C or RuO x H y /C)
on the diffusion layer and evaluated their performance in the pres-
ence of 100 ppm CO/H

3.3.4.3. Complementary composite film coating.  Uribe et al. placed

als. The MEA is prepared by brush painting an ink containing the

additional catalytic oxidation layer (selox layer) containing 20% Pt/Shawinigan carbon black at a loading of 0.1 mg Pt cm −2

3 -catalyst powders. This
posed a Ni-foam sheet filled with Au/Fe
catalyst sheet is placed in front of the Pt/Ru-C anode of a PEMFC,
separated by carbon paper that provides the necessary electrical
contact without compromising the gas transport ( Fig. 37 (a)). The
CO bonds created with Au are weaker than with Pt at 80 °C. Their
strength is comparable to the CO bonds with Pt at 200 °C. The se-
lective oxidation of CO is consequently increased in the Au-catalyst,
providing a higher CO tolerance to the system. The catalyst sheet
was  tested  simultaneously  with  an  oxygen  bleed,  being  able  to
mitigate 10 0 0 ppm CO with 1% oxygen ( Fig. 37 (b)) [176] .

3.3.5. Pulsed heating

A microheater device consisting of a stainless steel mesh was
introduced in direct contact with the anode to locally increase the
temperature, without affecting the temperature and the conductive
properties of the membrane ( Fig. 38 ). The temperature of the an-
ode was increased through heating pulses to recover the cell per-
formance  over-exposure  to  CO.  The  use  of  this  recovery  process
allowed a performance four times higher than the poisoned case
over the exposition to 10 0 0 ppm CO/H

2 [146] .

3.3.6. Pressure swing

The  pressure  swing  system  was  proposed  by  Guo  et  al..  As
shown in Fig. 39 , a fuel cell was divided into subunits, which were
connected to a feed control valve. Through this valve it is possi-
ble to pull off the supply of hydrogen to specific units, producing
a “vaccum”. Unconsumed hydrogen from the anode outlet mixed
with  air  or  oxygen  is  then  introduced  to  the  starved  cells.  The
amount of oxidant used is reduced compared to a typical air bleed,

non-noble metal on the anode carbon cloth, which is subsequently
dried and sintered. As with the previous anode reconfigurations,
the CO is oxidized with oxygen before entering the anode catalyst
layer [174] .

A  variety  of  metals  were  tested,  from  which  the  most  effec-
tive in promoting the CO oxidation correspond to metals (or their
oxides), that present at least two predominant low stable oxida-
tion  states  (1  to  4)  [174] .  Adcock  et  al.  studied  Fe,  Co  and  Cu,
from which the primary components in the composite were Fe
4 ,
Co
4  and  CuO,  respectively.  Fig.  36  presents  the  voltage  losses
presented by these different complementary composite film coat-
ings prepared and tested at 80 °C. The combined use of a com-
plementary composite film coating and an air bleed (6%) enhance
the tolerance of the cells to a concentration up to 500 ppm CO/H

oscillations [178,179] . Katsaounis et al. explained the improvement
of the performance of the cells under triode operation by the pro-
ton tunnelling mechanism, which increases the membrane conduc-
tivity [212,213] .

Another  advantage  is  the  use  of  less  expensive  materials
[177,212] and practical adaptation into stacks [178,179,181] . Among
the disadvantages is the power consumption in the auxiliary cir-
cuit,  and  the  corrosion-type  mode  under  which  the  three  elec-
trodes,  as  reduction  and  oxidation  reactions  take  place  on  their
surface at the same time [178,179,181] .

Martino et al. developed a model based on the laws of Kirchhoff
and the Nernst-Planck equation, and proposed a comb-type elec-
trode geometry that reduced the resistance between the auxiliary
electrode and anode or cathode. The new design was exposed to
up to 120 ppm CO/H
2 , increasing by 500% the power output com-
pared to a fuel cell operation under the same concentration of CO
[181] .

3.3.9. Periodic variation in the fuel supply
3.3.9.1. Cyclic injection of pure H 2 .  The reversibility of CO poison-
ing has been examined by different authors [60,64,75,89] . Zhang
et al. (2010 and 2011) showed that the adsorption of CO on Pt at
80 °C is reversible with a pure hydrogen purge, even when the Pt
is exposed to high concentrations of CO [214,215] . As such, the poi-
soning can be considered a transient phenomenon [64] .

Taking into account this property, Jimenez et al. proposed the
cyclic  feeding  of  hydrogen-containing  CO,  with  the  injection  of
2  streams. This operation allowed the desired cell voltage
pure H
range to be maintained during operation on 72 ppm CO/H
2  ( Fig.
43 ). An advantage of this operation is that due to the relatively
stable voltage, the lifetime of the cells is extended. However, care-
ful monitoring and control of the feed gasses is required [182] .

3.3.9.2. Periodic fuel starvation.  Hydrogen starvation occurs under
extreme operating conditions (high currents, failure to supply ad-
equate hydrogen to the anode), and results in an increase of the
anode potential. The electric potential difference is consequently
narrowed and even reversed [216,217] . Wilkinson et al. presented
the application of periodic starvation of fuel as a mitigation strat-
egy against CO. In the presence of the contaminant, the increase of
the anodic potential due to starvation is added to the rise due to
the accumulation of CO in the catalyst, resulting in the oxidation
of CO [183] .

Different set-ups were presented, such as the periodic interrup-
tion of the fuel, or the periodic introduction of a fuel-free fluid,
such as nitrogen, argon, helium and hydrocarbons into the anode.
Other possible fuel-free fluids are liquid water or the cathode ex-
haust from the fuel cell. Another setup involves the application of
a higher transient load, without the respective increase of the fuel
flow. It was proposed that the starvation is applied in a portion of
the anode while maintaining continuity in power supplied by the
rest of the fuel cell [183] .

An important consideration is the parameters used to define the
periods of fuel starvation and supply, as cell reversal is undesirable.
A controller is used to vary the frequency and length of the pulses
following a specific time set, or by monitoring the performance of
the cell [183] . The reversal of the cell implies the consumption and
not the supply of energy, the production of oxygen in the anode
and  of  hydrogen  in  the  cathode,  and  irreversible  damage  in  the
cell materials that affects the durability of the cell [216] . The tech-
2 and
nique has been evaluated in the presence of 75% H
10 ppm or 100 ppm CO [183] .

and the performance of the system is improved by a factor of four
in the presence of 10 0 0 ppm CO/H

2 [146] .

3.3.7. Combined break-in procedure and KMnO 4 treatment

Narayanan et al. proposed a regeneration process composed of
a  break-in  procedure  and  the  injection  of  a  diluted  solution  of
KMnO
4 in the anode. The break-in procedure consists of the appli-
cation of lower and higher overpotentials for a determined period,
where the CO is oxidised to produce CO
2 . In the presence of the
4 solution, the CO is also oxidised, this time by the nascent
KMnO
[O]. Fig. 40 compares the influence of the break-in procedure and
the KMnO
4 treatment on the catalyst activity at different tempera-
tures. The combination of both treatments allows the regeneration
of the catalyst by 90% [161] .

3.3.8. Triode operation

The  triode  operation  consists  of  the  addition  of  an  auxiliary
electrode to the fuel cell, in addition to the anode and the cath-
ode, and in contact with the membrane ( Fig. 41 ). Two circuits are
formed:

- The conventional fuel cell circuit between the anode and the

cathode.

- An  auxiliary  circuit,  between  the  auxiliary  electrode  and  the
cathode, working in parallel to the fuel cell and in electrolytic
mode ( I aux < 0 and (cid:2)V aux < 0).

Over the operation, the potential difference between the aux-
iliary electrode and the cathode increases simultaneously the po-
tential difference between the anode and the cathode. This allows
the fuel cell to operate at potentials not accessible under normal
operation (higher than 1.23 V), and thus, enhance its performance
[178,179,181] . Fig. 42 presents the performance of a cell exposed
to  90  ppm  CO/H
2  under  triode  operation  [181] .  In  the  presence
of CO, the transport of protons from the auxiliary electrodes en-
hances the oxidation of CO, favouring the self-sustained potential

tential increases and CO on the catalyst is oxidised to CO
2 ( Fig. 44 )
[184] . The removal of CO from the Pt surface occurs in a short pe-
riod (tens of milliseconds); thereby the anode potential is mostly
in the hydrogen oxidation region rather than in the CO oxidation
potential [28] .

The pulse amplitude can be adjusted depending on the specific
MEA, as the potential at which the CO oxidation occurs depends on

mission [182] .

the catalyst used. This can be determined through cyclic voltam-
metry. As for the pulse duration, some reports recommend keeping
this constant regardless of the CO concentration in the feed [184] .
Extending the pulse time unnecessarily long will reduce the fuel
cell efficiency [186] . Rather, it is the frequency of the pulse that
should be used as the key parameter to tune depending on the
size of the electrode, flow rate and CO concentration of the anode
feed [184] .

Studies with different CO concentrations have been performed,

from  50  ppm to  3% CO/H
compared to the operation with pure H

period. Therefore, the approach can only be relied upon in a con-
ventional bipolar stack if rigorous control of the voltage of each
cell in the stack can be achieved [186] . Adams et al. proposed a
new device that allows each cell in the stack to be pulsed indepen-
dently under controlled conditions. The Fuel Cell Health Manager
(FCHM) is a microprocessor-based controller that has proved to be
effective with 10,0 0 0 ppm CO [28,220,221] .

Another strategy to optimize the application of current pulses
is the use of a power converter. For instance, a two-stage dc/dc
power converter with a supercapacitor module was proposed by
Choi et al. to perform in a clean, fast and reliable manner the puls-
ing technique. It was possible to increase the power of the fuel cell
by 50% in the presence of hydrogen fuel with 500 ppm CO. The di-
agram of the device and the performance studies are shown in Fig.
46 [185] .

Palma et al. proposed a different power converter able to mod-
ulate the current drawn from the stack. As is shown in Fig. 47 , in-
stead of applying pulses of fixed magnitude, as in the conventional
current pulsing technique, the pulses vary linearly with load cur-
rent until full load. Fig. 47 also presents the system, which has a
boost converter in parallel with the reverse blocking diode placed
at the output terminals of the fuel cell. It only operates for the du-
ration of the pulses. The use of this device leads to reduced losses
when operating at light loads. It also extends the lifetime of the
fuel cell without reducing the output power [222,237] .

3.3.10.2. Negative potential pulses.  Mao et al. were the first to pro-
pose the application of a reverse voltage for the regeneration of a
single PEMFC in the presence of CO at the anode. During the neg-
ative pulse, water present at the anode is electrolyzed, producing
oxygen that oxidises the carbon monoxide on the Pt surface [188] .
The electrolysis reactions taking place are [187]

application of this technique is the model proposed by Ozdemir
et al. that predicts the CO coverage and the CO-free surface over
the application of the current pulsing technique in the presence of
10,0 0 0 ppm CO/H

2 [219] .

The pulsing technique presents several advantages as it allows
the direct use of reformate gas without a significant loss of perfor-
mance. Additionally, to carry out this technique, no external source
of energy is necessary, apart from that required to trigger the puls-
ing event. As for the losses, these arise due to the low voltage (in-
efficient operation) during the pulse [184] .

On the other hand, long-term stability tests are needed for the
catalysts used in this method [184] , such as the Pt dissolution and
the loss of ECSA (electrochemical surface area). This constitutes the
main reasons for the optimization of the pulses to reach a suffi-
ciently high anode overpotential to oxidise CO, but not so much as
to stress the electrode materials into degradation by dissolution,
for example [219] .

While  execution  of  this  method  with  single  cells  is  quite
straight-forward, applying it to a stack is much more challenging
as the balance of reactant distribution and resistances in the stack
means that each cell is likely to behave differently during the pulse

Wingelaar  et  al.  studied  the  application  of  periodic  negative
voltages to regenerate a system composed of four cells fed in se-
ries, but electrically connected in pairs (the first two and the last
two in parallel) [187] . Although the application of negative voltage
pulses requires a significant amount of power, it was possible to
increase to up to 500% the voltage output of the system when ex-
posed to 50 ppm CO/H
2 . The electrical position of the individual
cells in the stack determined their CO-tolerance and regeneration
[187] . Other advantages found by Mao et al. were the rapid and
more controllable application of this pulsing technique compared
to oxidant bleeding [188] .

3.3.11. Potential oscillations or self-oscillations

The  spontaneous  potential  oscillations  over  the  CO  poisoning
mentioned in Section 2.2.2 can also be used as a mitigation strat-
egy. As there is no need for any active control system or any ad-
ditional equipment, the self-oxidation can be considered a passive
back-up solution [41] . As previously mentioned, the oscillations oc-
cur under determined conditions. For instance, the concentration
of CO has to be high enough for the self-oxidation to take place
[41] , and a minimum current density is required [189] .

Fig. 48 shows the effect of the self-oxidation in a CO-poisoned
cell with 496 ppm CO. The catalyst used was Pt/Ru. The cell volt-
age drops until it reaches ~ 0.2 V, at which point the anode over-
potential is large enough to cause oxidation of CO. Thomason et al.
compared this method to the current pulsing technique. Both pre-
sented a similar efficiency in terms of the voltage produced and
the CO tolerance (496 ppm). However, the voltage cell was above
0.60 V about 50% of the time, compared to 80% in the case of the

4. Critical discussion on mitigation strategies

An array  of the  mitigation strategies  developed to  counteract
the pernicious effects of CO in PEMFC has been presented. Com-
paring the different technologies, it is possible to observe certain
trends and elucidate the most promising techniques to be used in
the future for each one of the categories where the strategies were
divided.

Currently,  95%  of  the  hydrogen  generated  worldwide  is  pro-
duced and used in the same location, as part of large industrial
processes [239] . However, some expect hydrogen to be generated
and purified on-board. This requires reformate pre-treatment tech-
nologies, that at present are part of large industrial processes, to
evolve into more compact designs. An indication of this trend is
the development of an ultrathin reformer incorporated to a high

Membranes, in particular made of two-dimensional materials,
are  the  most  promising  technology  of  the  pre-treatment  tech-
nologies presented. This is due in large part to the possibility of
separating additional pernicious contaminants to the operation of
2 . Membrane-based technologies also
PEMFC, such as CH
offer additional benefits such as low investment cost, facile opera-
tion, small footprint and easy maintenance [104] . Hence, this tech-
nology is also promising if adapted to on-board applications.

4  and CO

2 S  and NH

As mentioned, additional contaminants are present in the fuel,
which depend on the nature of the generation of hydrogen. In the
case  of reformate,  H
3  are also  present apart from CO
and  cause  degradation  of  the  cells.  Thus,  the  importance  of  the
study of mixtures of contaminants and the development of mit-
igation strategies able to neutralize their combined effect. Exam-
ples of these mitigation strategies are the air bleed and the HT-
PEMFC, able to mitigate both CO and H
2 S [151,158] . The deploy-
ment of these two strategies is expected to rise, in spite of their
operational challenges.

Another area of interest is the development of electrocatalysts,
as  the  scarcity  and  high  costs  of  platinum  represent  one  of  the
impediments for the commercialization of fuel cells [142] . Impor-
tant progress has been reported in terms of CO tolerance and the
reduction  of  platinum  use.  However,  the  stability  of  the  catalyst
structures, in particular of alloys, continues to be a challenge. Al-
though the catalyst tolerance to other contaminants such as H
2 S
has been explored [224] , the combined mitigation of CO, H
2 S and
other species has not been reported, showing a promising field of
research.

Due  to  the  catalyst  limitations,  other  engineering  and  oper-
ational  approaches  have  emerged  from  which,  pulsed  oxidation
through current pulses presents the highest tolerance to CO. Cells
have been tested in the presence of 3% CO/H
2  [218] . Considering
the CO content of the reformate after the WGS reaction of 1-2%
[12] , this is a mitigation strategy that could contribute to the to-
tal reduction of the more complex purification stages. Moreover,
no changes in the operating conditions, such as an increase in the
temperature are needed, and no other reactant is added as in the
oxidant bleeding technique. However, limitations still exist, such as
the degradation of the catalyst and further development is needed.

5. Future research on CO poisoning

The research on CO poisoning in PEMFC is taking different di-
rections.  Firstly,  new  techniques  are  being  developed  to  obtain
more  accurate  measurements  for  a  better  understanding  of  the
mechanisms of CO poisoning. For instance, Kaserer et al. took as
a reference the localised reference electrode technology presented
by Hinds et al. to study the poisoning in HT-PEMC [225,226] . An-
other  improvement  is  the  rapid  detection  of  the  CO  by  in-line
[227,228,240]  and in-situ [229]  sensors allowing the application
of a mitigation strategy before the performance of the cell is de-
graded.

An increasing array of analytical techniques is being applied to
understand the CO poisoning mechanism. Caldwell et al. applied
(cid:2)μ adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) to reveal details of
the binding-site for H, CO and biphosphate on the platinum anode
catalyst that contributes to the better performance of HT-PEMFC in
the presence of CO [230] . Another example is the use of the H
2 -
2  switch with Ar purge (HDSAP) method to study the effect of
D
humidity on contamination [214,215] .

Computational  and  modelling  methods,  often  combined  with
experimental validation, are being more extensively applied to de-
rive new insights and optimise mitigation techniques. For exam-
ple, new methods for the interpretation of how the EIS response
evolves over time due to the exposure of CO have been proposed.
These  include  techniques  such  as  real-time  drift  compensation,
time course interpolation and Z-HIT refinement [80,91] .

In  the  modelling  of  the  poisoning  process,  models  proposed
present specific limitations, such as accounting for the homogene-
ity of contamination over the anode [219] . However, good agree-
ment with experimental results is obtained over different stages
of CO poisoning, which include an initial decrease in performance,
pseudo-steady behaviour, and regeneration when exposed to pure
hydrogen. These modelling studies have been reviewed and criti-
cally compared in the literature [30,219,231] .

The studies evaluating the effects of CO poisoning on the anode
are extensive, with little research on the effects on other compo-
nents of the cell. It is expected that the research on the impact on
the cathode and the membrane, for instance, is extended, covering
short and long-term effects. These studies could also be executed
under the normal operation of the cell, and under harsh conditions
prone to occur, such as cold-freezing conditions.

Another  area  of  research  concerns  mixtures  of  contaminants,
which corresponds to more plausible conditions of operation than
a single contaminant. The nature of the contaminants depends on
the hydrogen generation process and on the purification step. As
new technologies  are developed for  the  production  of  hydrogen,
new  contaminants  are  expected  to  emerge.  The  effects  of  many
mixture combinations in operational fuel cell are unknown. For in-
stance, it is known that methane (CH
4 ) is a contaminant produced
from steam methane reforming and the purification by PSA [232] .
Although its presence is rare, the combined effects with CO has not
been studied.

As mentioned, the development of mitigation strategies against
CO is a key factor for the deployment of PEMFCs, as the increase in
the CO tolerance represents a reduction in the costs and volume of
the hydrogen purification stages. The research for techniques that
compel with these requirements without compromising the power
generated by the fuel cells continues. Additional issues are their
durability and complexity. CO tolerant electrocatalysts are the most
researched  area;  however,  a  variety  of  new  mitigation  strategies
has been proposed recently for their application over the hydrogen
purification and separation in site and on board, and during the
operation  of  the  cells.  Different  approaches  have  been  explored,
from the variation of operating conditions, to the addition of new
reactants in the fuel and the modification of the design of the cell.
Another approach towards the mitigation of CO poisoning is the
application  of  dual-purpose  redox  processes.  Designed  for  direct
methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), the removal of CO is done by the in-
jection of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), a toxic and carcinogenic
substance. The CO is used as a reducing agent for the Cr(VI) that
is converted into Cr(III). The removal of CO and the conversion of
Cr(VI) are done simultaneously [233] .

6. Conclusions

CO poisoning is an important area of research in PEM fuel cells
as the performance and durability of these cells are significantly
affected by it. A review of the mechanisms of contamination and
its effects on the performance of the cells shows the complexity of
the process as evidenced by the short and long-term degradation
on the anode side, impact on the cathode side, and the heteroge-
neous spatial distribution of the contamination. In recent years, the
development of more accurate techniques and advanced compu-
tational and modelling methods has contributed towards the dis-
covery of new information about the phenomena. More research
would elucidate a comprehensive profile of the poisoning and tol-
erance to CO.

Advancement in mitigation strategies that allow the reduction
of the space and costs that the actual H
2 separation and purifica-
tion processes represent is needed for the deployment of PEMFC.
Over the last decade, an array of varied techniques has emerged at
the ‘on site’ (pre-treatment of reformate) and ‘on board’ H
2 purifi-
cation stages, and particularly over the operation of the cells. The
development of CO-tolerant electro-catalysts continues to be the
most studied; nevertheless, other approaches have been explored
and shown to operate effectively with high CO tolerance.

Dr  Tom  Mason  studied  Chemical  Engineering  at  UCL
completing his studies in 2009, following this he under-
took his postgraduate studies also in Chemical Engineer-
ing focussing on advanced diagnostic techniques in the
field of hydrogen fuel cells. After completing his PhD in
2013 Dr Mason has led the engineering and manufactur-
ing development of the Bramble Energy core technology -
PCBFC. He was involved in the development of the PCBFC
whilst working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at
UCL. With initial proof of concept demonstrated, Dr Ma-
son was appointed as the technical lead of an InnovateUK
funded manufacturing project. As a co-founder of Bram-
