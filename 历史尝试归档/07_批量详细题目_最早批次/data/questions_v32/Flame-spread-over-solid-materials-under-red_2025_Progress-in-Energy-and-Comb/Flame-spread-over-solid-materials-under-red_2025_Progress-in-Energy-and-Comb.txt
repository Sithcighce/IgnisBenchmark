Space exploration is a shared human aspiration that presents significant challenges, with fire being a major
threat. The unique low-gravity, reduced-buoyancy environments of spacecraft and extraterrestrial habitats
profoundly alter fluid dynamics, chemical reactions, and heat-mass transfer, leading to drastic changes in fire
behavior. Understanding the solid material combustion under these conditions is vital for spacecraft fire safety
and advances fundamental combustion science. This review synthesizes research on flame spread over solid
materials under reduced buoyancy/gravity over the past half-century. It uniquely integrates the studies con-
ducted in micro- and partial-gravities with ground-based experiments designed to mimic these environments.
The review begins with the theoretical models defining the flame behavior and examines experimental findings
from low gravities. These results reveal the important roles of “smothering” effects and radiative heat loss due to
the suppressed natural convection, which drive a transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional flame
structures. Ground-based simulation methodologies, including reduced pressure environments and narrow
channel apparatus, are critically examined for their ability to replicate low gravities. Stagnation point low-stretch
diffusion flames are also included as a ground-based method to simulate the reduced-buoyancy effects on the
spreading flame front from a more microscopic perspective. By comparing actual low-gravity data with simulated
environments, the review introduces key similarity laws but also discusses the limitations of these methods in
fully capturing low-gravity combustion dynamics. As the first integrated review of this topic, this work provides
essential insights for ensuring the fire safety of human space exploration in the decades to come.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background and motivation

The successful launch of “Sputnik 1” artificial satellite into a Low
Earth Orbit (LEO) in 1957 marks a historic milestone in space explora-
tion. Thereafter into the 21st century, extensive space exploration pro-
grams are promoted in government and commercial
levels. The
technologies developed therein, have benefitted to everyday human life.
According to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs [1], the
number of global space launches has significantly increased since 2015,
e.g., a total of 2849 objects launched into space in 2024 (Fig. 1).

During manned space exploration missions, the spacecraft and future
planned extraterrestrial habitats will serve as shelters for the safety and
health of astronauts. The environmental control and life support system
(ECLSS) inside a spacecraft integrates a number of complex subsystems,
such as gas supply and pressure regulation subsystem, gas purification
and pollution control subsystem, gas circulation and temperature and
humidity control subsystems, which consist of a large number of elec-
trical devices and up to 400(cid:0) 500 different types of non-metallic solid
materials [2]. However, the complexity of extraterrestrial space (such as
low-gravity environment), and the long-term operation of electrical
equipment, undoubtedly increase the fire risk of spacecraft.

Spacecraft and extraterrestrial habitats are highly isolated and
confined structures. In the event of a fire, the thermal feedback effect
caused by the restricted space will induce a rapid increase in the heat
release rate (HRR), pressure, temperature, and concentration of toxic
gases from the burning solid materials, making it extremely difficult for
the astronauts to escape or to be rescued. Unfortunately, over the past
six decades of human spaceflight, several serious spacecraft fires have
occurred, resulting in catastrophic outcomes. In the 1960s, the early
American manned spacecraft were designed with high oxygen concen-
trations, and in some cases, even pure oxygen atmosphere, to reduce
weight and simplify engineering controls [3]. This design led to tragic
incidents such as the Apollo 1 fire, which claimed the lives of several
astronauts. In response, the Apollo program and subsequent missions
placed increased emphasis on fire safety in manned spacecraft. In the
subsequent space shuttle program, there were no serious fire accidents
such as those in the Apollo program, but there were still sporadic elec-
trical failures that could have resulted in major fire accidents.

According to NASA’s report [4], at least five fire-related incidents
occurred during the 50 space shuttle missions conducted between 1981
and 1993, reflecting an accident rate of 10 %. The space station faces
similar high fire risks owing to its increased system complexity. On
February 23, 1997, a serious fire broke out in the Mir space station.
Fortunately, the fire was swiftly extinguished within 1.5 min, averting a
potential disaster. Guibaud et al. [5] compiled and compared past
typical aerospace fire accidents and discussed the valuable experience
gained from these accidents. Fire safety is crucial to the success of space
exploration missions, and a clear understanding of the combustion dy-
namics of solid materials in the space environment is fundamental to
ensuring the safety of manned space exploration.

In contrast to the Earth’s surface, a spacecraft operating in an orbit
experiences prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, posing
unique scientific challenges in understanding the fire behaviors.

Microgravity combustion is one of the key fundamental problems in the
field of combustion, and several insightful papers [6–13] and book [14]
have provided comprehensive review of the work dealing with the
phenomena, dynamics, and progress of microgravity combustion.
Typically, the heat release from combustion results in the density of
gaseous combustion products at the flame front being around 10 % of
the density of the unburned reactants at standard temperature and
pressure [14]. In the gravitational field, this large density difference can
induce a strong buoyant flow (natural convection), whereas in micro-
resultant
almost
gravity,
energy-species-momentum transfer, scalar distributions and flow insta-
bility induced by natural convection are suppressed or eliminated; sec-
ondary forces and phenomena, such as molecular diffusion, electrostatic
forces, thermophoresis, thermocapillary forces, as well as other sources
of instability, which are masked by buoyancy in the gravitational fields
can emerge, or become important; the time and length scales related to
combustion increase, leading to that of the soot formation, radiative
heat loss, such that the resultant flame extinction limits become more
sensitive to the environment parameters.

Despite the presence of forced convection (typically 15–20 cm/s)
from the heating, ventilation, crews’ movement, and air conditioning
system (HVAC) [14] in manned spacecraft, it is still weaker than the
natural convection induced by buoyancy in 1 g (~30 cm/s) [15–17].
Noted that the current NASA protocol in case of fire is to shut off the air
circulation fans. Therefore, the real spacecraft fire scenario is typically
the condition where a forced flow speed can be appreciably smaller than
that of a natural convection-induced flow on the earth (1 g). For brevity,
in the following discussion, the term “low-speed convection” will be
used to refer the microgravity condition where the forced convective
flow velocity is, say, less than 30 cm/s. In addition to microgravity
during orbital flight, manned spacecraft and extraterrestrial habitats
will be subject to the local gravity levels of other planets. Based on the
latest space exploration plans, the global space community is now
focused on manned missions to the Moon and Mars, and the establish-
ment of extraterrestrial habitats in the near future. The surfaces of the
Moon (0.16 g) and Mars (0.38 g) are typical partial-gravity environ-
ments, where intermediate buoyancy introduces complex, nonlinear
effects on combustion. As a result, studying combustion in micro- and
partial-gravities becomes a key research area, driven by the pressing
need to ensure fire safety in manned spacecraft and extraterrestrial
habitats.

Understanding the combustion behavior of solid materials is the
cornerstone of fire safety for manned space exploration missions [9].

Y. Ma et al.

The combustion of solid materials comprises three main stages: ignition,
flame spread, and extinction. Solid combustion is classified as either
smoldering or flaming, depending on the presence or absence of flame.
Given the extensive nature of solid combustion, it cannot be adequately
covered in a single review. Therefore, this review focuses specifically on
flaming flame spread and extinction over solid materials. Flame spread
and extinction plays a pivotal role in ensuring fire safety, as it provides
important information for estimation of fire growth rate, material
flammability, development of extinguishing devices, and establishment
of fire safety standards.

The current fire safety standards utilized by NASA (STD-6001 B)
employ a screening process to assess materials based on their ability to
support flame spread over a defined distance under a specific test con-
dition [18]. Theories for the flame spread and extinction over solid fuel
have been summarized in several reviews, emphasized on the funda-
mental mechanism of multiple types of flame spread [19–22], modeling
and simulation [23,24], opposed flame spread [25], concurrent flame
spread [26], near-limit flame spread [27], flammability limit [9,28], and
sources of uncertainty [29]. Chapter 5 in Ref. [14] provides a review of
flame-spread studies up to the year 2000.

The propagation of a flame over a solid fuel surface involves a
sequence of ignition stages. Initially, the unburned solid fuel in the
preheating zone is heated and undergoes pyrolysis, with heat originated
from either the neighborhood flame heat flux in the gas phase, thermal
conduction through the solid phase, or the external radiative heating.
The flame then initiates the ignition of the combustible mixture formed
by the ambient oxygen and the fuel vapor released from the solid. The
continuous flame spread can be sustained by the above actions, incor-
porating various processes in both the solid phase (such as heat transfer,
pyrolysis) and the gas phase (including transport, mixing, and com-
bustion). Hence, the flame spread involves various nonlinear and com-
plex processes, showing unique behaviors, especially under low-speed
convection as compared to the normal gravity. Additionally, the intri-
cate interplay of these processes implies that even slight environmental
alterations necessitate the flame spread system to attain a new equilib-
rium state or even to trigger system instabilities, by altering typically a
long relaxation time in a solid combustion system. Note that observing
an entire flame spread process requires significantly longer time as
compared to conventional combustion phenomena with gaseous fuels.
For instance, in the concurrent flame spread experiment conducted in
the Cygnus spacecraft (microgravity) [30], the thin composite cotton
fabric sample requires over 100 s to achieve a quasi-steady spread state
after ignition.

Experimental platforms

to replicate low-gravity environments
experienced during spacecraft operations are crucial in studying the
combustion behavior of solid materials under low-speed convection.
Commonly utilized low-gravity experimental platforms include a drop
tower, parabolic flight, sounding rocket, space shuttle, spacecraft, sat-
ellites, and space stations, as shown in Fig. 2. Rojas-Alva and Jomaas

speed convection environments at 1g: low pressure, narrow channel apparatus,
and low stretch flame.

[11] reviewed the history and achievements of solid combustion
research carried out using these platforms.

* The following cost estimates for conducting experiments on various
reduced-gravity platforms may be conservative, as they do not account for
additional logistics, preparation expenses, or regional differences in pricing
across countries and facilities.

(cid:0) 3 to 10

Drop towers are ground-based platforms that create microgravity in
(cid:0) 7 g range through free-falling. It is currently the
the level of 10
most widely used facility due to its relative convenience as well as
affordability (cost of single free-fall in the order of $1000)*. However,
drop towers have limitations such as very short durations (typically
1(cid:0) 10 s) and large deceleration shocks during recovery. For example,
Zero Gravity Facility in NASA offers a microgravity environment of
(cid:0) 5 g for 5.18 s and the deceleration shock can reach up to 65 g.
10
Although there have been many solid combustion studies on thermally-
thin materials, there are few reports on the use of drop towers for
thermally-thick material combustion, which usually require a longer
response time to the change in gravity level as compared to microgravity
duration.

A parabolic flight enables multiple rounds of micro- and partial
gravity testing, typically offering 20–30 s of test time per cycles (up to 40
cycles per flight). While parabolic flights extend the microgravity
duration compared to drop towers, they are also more costly per flight
(about $30,000)*, resulting in a limited number of institutions capable
of conducting such experiments. Furthermore, a parabolic flights is
probably subject to “g-jitter” caused by the atmospheric interference and

its fluctuation may not be sufficient to be considered properly in elim-
inating buoyancy effect [33,34].

(cid:0) 1 to 10

Sounding rockets typically operate in Earth sub-orbits, and thus face
a thinner atmosphere than parabolic flights, providing a microgravity
duration on the order of minutes. However, the integration and auto-
mation requirements for the test systems, coupled with lengthy
manufacturing times, have restricted the experimental test in sounding
rockets primarily to Europe and the United States, limiting their wide-
spread application globally.

Orbiting spacecraft, including space shuttles, spacecraft, satellites,
and space stations, usually operate in LEO, and thus can provide a high

level of microgravity environment (10
However, conducting experiments on these platforms is costly (~
$100,000)*, logistically challenging, and subject to strict constraints
(such as apparatus size and HRR), with very limited opportunities
available. It is worth mentioning that the fire experiment carried out on
the “Cygnus” spacecraft [30,35,36] is one of the most representative
microgravity experiments in recent years because of the large-scale
samples were used (length: ~1 m). Since the Cygnus is an unmanned
cargo spacecraft for International Space Station (ISS), fire experiments
on it alleviate the safety of crews even with large-scale fire experiments,
and researchers have realized the first long-duration meter-scale flame
spread experiment.

At present, an experiment to be conducted on a microgravity plat-
form requires careful consideration of trade-offs among key factors such
as cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and the duration of high-quality
microgravity conditions. Additionally, due to safety concerns associ-
ated with the combustion experiments, as well as constraints related to
load size and potential impact from intense shocks, there are strict
limitations on the scale of combustion experiments. Furthermore, even
though lightweight optical equipment can be utilized, high-precision
combustion diagnostics with these facilities is difficult to apply. The
above difficulties are common challenges in the field of microgravity
combustion.

Using ground-based facilities to “reproduce” combustion phenomena
occurring in real micro- and partial gravity environments is a promising
approach. For an incompressible fluid (typical reactive fluid in a fire
scenario), the role of gravity (g) in the momentum and energy conser-
vation equations (excluding the gas radiation term) under natural

(cid:0)

Generally, varying the characteristic length and fluid density could
effectively mimic the effect of reduced gravity. This implicit mathe-
matical relationship among these parameters offers a potential avenue
to simulate low-gravity environments using ground-based facilities.
Basically, three primary methodologies are employed to generate
low-speed convection environments under the
reduced buoyancy,
normal gravity, as depicted in Fig. 3. First, a low-speed convection can
be achieved by decreasing the Grashof number through reducing the
ambient pressure by decreasing gas density. Second, a narrow channel
apparatus (NCA) can be utilized by reducing experimental space size
and artificially limit fluid buoyancy development length, thus achieving

low-speed convection. Third, a stagnation flow can be adopted by the
radius of curvature of solid fuel to be large, such that the velocity
gradient toward the flame, thereby the flame stretch rate can be
reduced. Therefore, the stagnation point low-stretch diffusion flame can
be a promising method to study the spreading flame front in simulating
low-speed convection from a more microscopic perspective. Although
these methodologies have explored extensively in microgravity com-
bustion research over the decades, there is still a notable absence of
comprehensive reviews that summarize the related advancements,
particularly regarding flame spread and extinction over solid fuels. This
topic is closely linked to spacecraft fire safety and warrant further
investigation.

1.2. Structure of this review

This review concentrates on flame spread and extinction over solid
materials in reduced buoyancy low-speed convection conditions. It is
not only aiming a broad view of recent advancements in micro- and
partial gravity environments, but also covers a deeper look on ground-
based simulation environments. Fundamental aspects of flame spread
and extinction in low-pressure and narrow channel apparatus are dis-
cussed. This review also addresses low-stretch flames that developed
over large-radius of curvature solid fuels, as it allows for a more
microscopic exploration of the combustion dynamics of a spreading
flame front in a quasi-steady state. By comparing combustion behavior
in “real” micro- and partial gravity with that in aforementioned artificial
“simulated” environments,
similarity laws,
methods, advantages, and challenges.

the review explores

The organization of this review is as follows. Section 2 summarizes
theories, models, and non-dimensional parameters relevant to flame
spread and extinction, particularly in reduced-buoyancy low-speed
convection. Section 3 provides a baseline by reviewing studies in “real”
micro- and partial gravity environments, focusing on transient flame
growth, quasi-steady flame spread, near-limit flame spread, and flam-
mability limit of solid materials. Section 4 summarizes research on flame
spread and extinction in reduced pressure, discussing pressure-gravity-
dependence with controlling parameters (temperature and standoff
distance of flame front, flame length, and heat flux distribution in pre-
heating zone), and the challenges of replicating reduced buoyancy
caused by the variations in fuel-oxidizer mixing, chemical kinetics and
dripping flow. Section 5 discusses the principles of using narrow channel
apparatus (NCA) to simulate micro- and partial gravity conditions,
focusing on fingering instability (flamelet mode) and limitations due to
enclosure effects (flow field, global stoichiometry and wall heat losses).
Section 6 focuses on the stagnation point low-stretch diffusion flames,
discussing quasi-steady, unsteady, and flammability aspects, along with
simulation accuracy issues due to the differences in flame instability

mechanisms in low- and normal gravity. Section 7 summarizes the re-
view, highlights future challenges, and offers guidelines in optimizing
artificial simulation methodologies.

2. Basic theory of flame spread over solid materials

The terminology “flame spread rate” (FSR, Vf) usually refers to the
speed where a flame front propagates over the surface of solid material.
In a quenching zone between a spreading flame front and solid fuel
surface, a fuel concentration gradient exists covering from lean to rich
mixtures. The flame in this region shows a partially-premixed nature
having a triple (or tribrachial) flame structure (Fig. 4a) with a lean and a
rich premixed flame wings and a trailing diffusion flame [37,38]. Such a
tribrachial flame can also appear briefly near the blowoff limit (Fig. 4b)
due to the stratified fuel concentration. For a laminar lifted flame
without having conduction or radiation losses (neglecting gas-phase
radiation), the flame exhibits a unique propagation edge speed. When
scaled with the stoichiometric laminar burning speed, the ratio depends
on the fuel concentration gradient. In contrast to a lifted flame, when the
edge of a spreading flame is in close proximity to a material surface, the
heat loss and radical quenching significantly impact the edge flame
propagation speed and solid pyrolysis rate, which complicates pre-
dictions for the FSR.

Depending on the direction of flame propagation and the ambient
airflow, conventional flame spread scenarios can be classified into two
modes: opposed flame spread and concurrent flame spread, where the
flame spread direction is opposite to or same as the airflow direction,
respectively. The characteristic airflow over a solid fuel surface can be a
result from buoyant flow (natural convection) or from ambient airflow
driven by mechanical pumping (forced convection). Even in a quiescent
environment (absence of airflow), such as in microgravity, one can still
assume that gaseous molecules flow towards the flame front with a
specific speed, when considering the flame front position as the origin of
the spatial reference system. In a gravitational field, since the direction
of buoyancy-induced flow can be approximated as vertically upward,
downward/upward flame spread can be typically categorized as
opposed/concurrent flame spread, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Noted that, in
the case of upward flame spread, burnout materials, such as PMMA,
typically exhibit a stagnation flow character in the flame stabilization
zone. For thick burnout samples, the flame stretch rate is dictated by the
curvature of regression solid surface. For thin burnout materials the
envelope flame shape is largely influenced by the fuel vapor jet directed
upstream. On the other hand, non-burnout samples, such as fiber-
reinforced materials or charring samples, exhibit a side-stabilization
flame, and their flame stabilization behavior is similar to that
observed in downward flame spread. These differences in flame stabi-
lization are crucial for understanding the extinction limits of different
materials.

In the following, the length and time scales associated with flame
spread will be briefly introduced along with the development of flame
spread theories for these two classic modes.

2.1. Time and length scales

The time- and length scales, and non-dimensional parameters related
to a flame spread process are examined based on the prior work of
Bhattacharjee and coworkers [41–45]. Due to the complex nature of the
nonlinear dynamic processes involved, obtaining an explicit and
analytical solution for the FSR remains challenging when assumptions
and simplifications are not employed. One important simplification in-
volves assuming the activation energy of the solid fuel to be infinite. In
this assumption, the solid fuel initiates pyrolysis and sustains flame
propagation only when it is heated to a cutoff “pyrolysis temperature”
(Tp), which is commonly treated as a thermodynamic property of a
material. The resultant FSR is primarily dependent on two fundamental
time scales: the time required for a virgin solid fuel to reach its pyrolysis

temperature and the time taken for gaseous combustible mixtures to
undergo ignition. The relative importance of these two time scales de-
termines that flame spread behavior is in radiative regime, thermal
regime, or kinetics regime. Although “pyrolysis temperature” is widely
used in simplified flame spread models and assumes the flame front
coincides with the pyrolysis front, note that the pyrolysis rate of solid is
an exponential function of temperature according to the Arrhenius
relation. Optical diagnostics by Morrisset et al. [46] reveal that, the solid
pyrolysis begins about 1 mm upstream of the flame front during
downward flame spread over a thick PMMA slab. Thus, the combustible
partially-premixed reactants are present ahead of the flame front.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the pyrolysis temperature is not
constant for a specific fuel but could vary as functions of ambient
pressure, oxygen level, flow velocity, and fuel thickness [47].

A scale analysis typically begins with a two-dimensional flame
spread over a homogeneous flat solid fuel with the half thickness τ in a
free stream speed of Vg, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The time required for the
virgin solid fuel to reach its pyrolysis temperature, i.e., the solid fuel
residence time (ts,res), can be formulated from its definition as:

ts,res = Lpr

/

Vf

(2.1)

where Lpr is the length of the preheating zone. In essence, ts,res is asso-
ciated with the geometry of the control volume along with the net heat
transfer to it.

For an opposed flame spread, the length of the controlled volume, i.
e., Lpr, is determined by the competition between the heat conduction in
gas- and solid-phases:
[
Lgx, Lsx

Lpr = max

(2.2)

]

where Lgx and Lsx are the thermal diffusion length scales in gas- and solid
phases, respectively. The thickness of the control volume should further
consider the in-depth conductive heat loss:
[

,

(2.3)

where τh is the thermal penetration depth and αs is the thermal diffu-
sivity of solid fuel. When τ ≤ τh, the solid fuel is considered as thermally-
thin, while when τ > τh it is thermally-thick. For the intermediate
thickness (τ and τh are of the same magnitude), Delichatsios [48] made a
more rigorous derivation of Lsy.

For thermosetting solid fuels, the main heat transfer modes include
the gas-phase heat flux from flame, the heat conduction through solid
phase, surface re-radiation. During an opposed flame spread, the
convective heat loss plays a minor role in the energy balance, which
differs from the conventional piloted ignition of a solid fuel. This is
because the convective heat loss from the solid surface is transferred
back to the opposed flow, contributing to the temperature of flame (Tf).
Flame radiative heat flux usually can be neglected due to its limited view
factor, and is only non-negligible if the downstream flame has a large
optical thickness. Therefore, the gas-phase heat flux is controlled by the
standoff distance of flame front (Lgy), and the thermal diffusion length
scale (Lgx). Then, the convection-diffusion balance leads to

where Vr is the relative flow speed imposed to the flame front (i.e., the
characteristic flow speed in the gas phase). It is common to assume
Lg ≈ Lgx ≈ Lgy, because both Lgx and Lgy decrease monotonically with
increasing Vr.

In analyzing flame dynamics, it is crucial to consider the develop-
ment of the boundary layer upstream of the flame, necessitating the use
of effective flow speed (Vg,eff) and buoyant flow speed (Vb), accounting
for the velocity gradient, such that Vr = Vg,eff + Vb + Vf [33]. Bhatta-
charjee et al. [49] identified a relationship between Vg,eff and free stream

Ld and then empirically as
Vg,eff∝Vg/
Ld , where ReLd is the Reynolds number based on the
flow development length scale Ld. Note that based on the latter corre-
lation, Vg,eff is only about 11 cm/s when Ld is 60 mm and Vg is 1 m/s.
The buoyant flow speed Vb can be estimated by equating the buoy-
ancy term in the momentum equation to the inertia term, as Vb∝
[
αggβ
. For a downward flame spread under no-forced flow
and normal gravity, Vr is predominantly composed of Vb. For flat solid
fuels, Vb is typically about 1.9 cm/s in downward spread mode [44],
while for cylindrical solid fuels with large surface curvature (small
radius), Vb could increase to about 4.2 cm/s due to thinner boundary
layer thickness formed over the cylindrical surface [50].

For a concurrent flame spread, the heat supply from flame to the
solid fuel mainly takes place within the flame length (Lf), thus the pre-
heating length scale in the gas-phase can be simplified as the difference
between the flame length and the pyrolysis length (Lpy) as:

Lf,pr = Lf (cid:0) Lpy

(2.5)

As such, the concurrent flame spread usually has a much larger gas-
phase preheating length as compared to the opposed flame spread.
Therefore, Eq. (2.2) can be simplified as Lpr = Lf,pr.

In the solid phase, the forward conductive heat (from pyrolysis zone
to preheating zone) depends on the temperature gradient at pyrolysis
front. Since the pyrolysis temperature is approximated as a constant, the
longitudinal thermal diffusion length scale in solid phase (Lsx) controls
the heat conduction, thus expressed as:

shear stress [52–56]. In such a case, the heating from the dripping flow
may even become the dominant driving mechanism in a downward
flame spread. An effective heating length of the liquid-phase Marangoni
convection and dripping flow should be further incorporated in the
definition of preheating zone in Eq. (2.2).

In the gas phase, the time taken for the fuel-air mixture to undergo
ignition, is related to the gas residence time and chemical reaction time.
The proper choice of the length scale for estimating the gas residence
time (tg,res) is crucial, as it essentially corresponds to identifying the
flame stabilization zone. In an opposed flame spread, the residence time
of fuel-air mixture before it is swept away from the characteristic length
scale (preheating zone (Lgx)) by the airflow, is given as [57]:

tg,res = Lgx

/

Vr = αg

/

.

(2.8)

In a concurrent side-stabilized flame spread, the length scale remains the
stabilization zone at flame base (Lgx), but the flow speed seen by a flame
base is given by Vr = Vg,eff + Vb (cid:0) Vf. In a concurrent envelope flame
[57], where αg is the gas-phase thermal
spread, the length scale is
diffusivity and a is the flame stretch rate (evaluated by the local flow
speed and radius of regression surface).

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅

In a low-speed convection environment, tg,res becomes large and
leads to a significant heat transfer between the fuel-air mixture and
ambient. Employing a thin gas approximation with a constant Planck
mean absorption coefficient ap, the gas-phase radiation time tg,rad is
defined as the characteristic time in which the heat released by the fuel-
air mixture in the preheating zone can be radiated away:

(2.9)

This implies that in the solid fuel when the forward solid-phase
conductive heat drives the flame spread, the energy balance equation
can be a non-linear function of the FSR. A slight decrease in the FSR will
enlarge ts,res as well as Lsx. Consequently, the larger Lsx in turn reduces
the temperature gradient at the flame front while increases the surface
re-radiation, leading to a further reduction in the FSR. As a result, the
flame front cannot spread forward and flame extinction may occur due
to this negative feedback loop.

Surface re-radiation covers the entire preheating zone, accordingly
the length scale associated with it should be the preheating length (Lpr).
If a flame radiation is negligible, a solid-phase radiation number (Rrad,s)
can be employed to characterize the importance of surface re-radiation.
It is defined as the ratio of the surface re-radiative heat flux to the gas-
phase conductive heat flux:

cannot be overlooked in case of low-speed convection due to the
lower heat supply from flame. In a concurrent flame spread, Ly can be
replaced by the standoff distance of flame in the preheating zone (δf). It
is expected that surface re-radiation will become more important in the
continued development of concurrent flame spread (where the flame
becomes longer in length and thicker in thickness). This allows the
concurrent flame to eventually reach a quasi-steady spread stage rather
than a continuous acceleration [51]. Meanwhile, Rrad,s increases with
the increase in Tp, implying that the flame spread over a solid fuel with a
high Tp will be significantly influenced by the surface re-radiation.

For a thermoplastic solid fuel, the burning fuel undergoes melting
and the formation of molten state. In a gravitational field, dripping could
occur when the gravity of molten fuel exceeds surface tension force and

where Y is the mass fraction, ΔHc is the heat of combustion, and the
subscript F denotes the fuel vapor. A gas-phase radiation number Rrad,g
can be used to evaluate the importance of gas-phase radiative heat loss:

When Rrad,g approaches zero, gas-phase radiative heat loss is negligible.
When Rrad,g is moderate, the flame is cooled by the radiative heat loss
and the flame temperature becomes a function of Vr. When Rrad,g ap-
proaches infinity, the fuel-air mixture encounters a significant heat loss
before ignited, therefore the flame may be quenched by the gas-phase
radiation.

In reality, in the regime of very low flow speed, the flame is neither
optically thick nor optically thin, and there is substantial self-
absorption, particularly from CO2 inside the flame [58]. Using a con-
stant ap may overestimate the flame radiative loss and the heat supply to
solid. This limitation can be addressed by multiplying a correction factor
(less than 1) to ap [59], providing an engineering solution to overcome
the need for a spectral radiation model.

The chemical reaction time to consume the fuel vapor in a fuel-air
mixture (tg,chem), is commonly formulated by assuming a second order

high-speed airflow and the effect of finite-rate chemistry emerges. When
tg,res≫tg,chem, i.e., Da approaches infinity, the effect of flame stretch
becomes negligible.

This non-dimensional number of Da is widely recognized as the best
indicator for flame extinction. A key factor in its calculation is the proper
choice of the length scale, as discussed in Eq. (2.8). Since this length
scale depends on the flame stretch rate, the pressure dependence of Da
can differ between side-stabilized flames and envelope flames [60], as
will be elaborated in the following sections. Furthermore, the evaluation
of Tf and YO2 is crucial in determining Da, particularly when assessing
the critical Da for extinction limit. An appropriate choice of these values
ensures that at extinction (both blowoff and quenching), Da remains on
the order of unity. Typically, for blowoff extinction where heat loss is
negligible, the adiabatic flame temperature is adopted for Tf under the
large activation energy approximation. In contrast, for quenching
extinction where radiative loss is significant, the reduced Tf leads to a
larger non-dimensional pre-exponential term, thereby lowering the Da.
In this case, it is more appropriate to adopt the critical flame tempera-
ture at the extinction limit in calculating Da. In the diffusion flame zone
where Tf peaks, YO2 is much smaller than the ambient, and its value
varies with flow conditions. Its exact value should be calculated based
on the theory of mixture fraction [61]. So far, many simplified models
evaluate the Da using the ambient oxygen level and the adiabatic flame
temperature, in order to highlight the influence of flow velocity on flame
residence time. Nevertheless, it should be noted that these two param-
eters affect the Da under blowoff and quenching conditions through
multiple mechanisms.

Above scale analysis suggests that the length and time scales related
to flame spread are highly responsive to environmental parameters,
particularly the airflow speed. An alteration in the buoyancy effect
(buoyancy induced flow) is expected to induce a notable variation in a
flame spread behavior.

2.2. Opposed flame spread

Systematic theoretical studies on opposed flame spread behavior
over solid surfaces began in the 1960s. de Ris [62] proposed that, the
gas-phase heat conduction into the preheating zone is the critical factor
driving opposed flame spread when Lgx≫Lsx. Subsequent studies
extensively validated this assumption, which can be applicable to typical
flame spread behaviors observed in realistic fire scenarios, through the
measurements of temperature and flow field [22,63]. For example, Blasi
et al. [64] found that for most homogenous solid fuels, the FSR is in-
dependent of the heat conductivity of solid material along the flame
spread direction. Forward (parallel) heat conduction in solid-phase can
be a primary driving factor for an opposed flame spread under specific
conditions [63,65], including a low ambient oxygen level, a significantly
high external airflow speed, or a large thermal diffusivity of solid phase.
These factors contribute to an extended residence time of solid phase
(Eqs. (2.1) and (2.6)). In these context, most subsequent theories on
opposed flame spread have developed based on the basic assumption by
de Ris [52].

The model by de Ris assumes an opposed plug flow without having
velocity gradient (bulk velocity Vg), constant flame temperature (Tf) and
thermodynamics properties, infinite-rate chemistry (flame sheet), unity
Lewis number, and Lgx =
Lgy [62]. A closed-form expression for
opposed FSR can be obtained by solving two-dimensional conservation
equations. For a thermally thin solid fuel, the FSR Vf is:

with Vg.

The experiment results by Hirano et al. [66] are qualitatively
consistent with the predictions of the de Ris model. Quantitatively,
however, Wichman and Williams [67] pointed out that the theoretical
FSRs calculated based on the de Ris model are significantly larger than
the experimental FSRs for thermally thin solids as reported by
Fernandez-Pello et al. [65].

√

Delichatsios [68] suggested that the error in the de Ris model pri-
marily arises from the approximation of the flame heat flux into the
preheating zone (assuming no heat loss in the preheating zone and linear
temperature distribution). An exact solution was proposed for opposed
FSR over a thermally thin solid, where the coefficient
on the RHS of
Eq. (2.13a) is replaced by π/4. Subsequent studies have extensively
validated the applicability of the exact solution by Delichatsios. Bhat-
tacharjee et al. [69,70] systematically evaluated the assumptions in the
de Ris model. Their results suggested that neglecting flame radiation
under the assumption of an infinitely-rate chemistry is valid. However,
the uniform flow assumption introduces errors in predicting FSR,
because of the velocity gradient near the surface due to the boundary
layer. As such, when it comes to evaluate the gas-phase length and time
scales, the relative flow speed (Vr) in fact should be the local flow speed
at flame front.

Wichman and Williams [71] suggested that the flame spread in the
thermal regime can be simply solved based on energy equations, if ki-
netics effect is eliminated. Based on similar ideas, Bhattacharjee et al.
[41–43], using the scaling analysis, reduced the complex flame spread
problem into a simple energy balance equation in the vicinity of flame

Apart from the coefficient

on the RHS of Eq. (2.13a), the solution
for the FSR in Eq. (2.14) is the same as de Ris model. Quintiere [61]
proposed a pure heat transfer FSR model as:

where C is an empirical constant, Dacr and Dax are the Damkohler

simplify the analysis of flame spread over solid fuels, and can further
extend the opposed-flame framework to concurrent flames.

A theory for opposed flame spread based on the “gas-phase heat
conduction controlled model” has been extensively developed in the
past nearly 60 years. However, for composite materials, such as an
electrical wire with a high thermal conductivity metal core, Lsx is
comparable to Lgx and the forward solid-phase heat conduction is un-
avoidable in an opposed flame spread. In 1981, Bakhman et al. [73]
observed that, wires with a higher thermal conductivity metal core play
a role in accelerating the flame spread. Several measurements [52,74,
75] on the temperature profiles of the metal core in preheating zone,
indicate that a highly conductive core exhibits a larger longitudinal
thermal diffusion length (Lsx). These large Lsx are comparable to or even

larger than the gas-phase thermal length, implying that the forward
solid-phase heat conduction may be the driving mechanism of flame
spread. The significance of thermal conduction through a metallic core,
and its resultant impacts on wire combustion were reviewed by Huang
and Nakamura [76].

To quantify the forward heat conduction through a metal core,
Huang et al. [77] proposed a theoretical expression on the temperature
profile of the metal core based on energy balance equation:

Acλc

+ (Acρccc)Vf

ʹ

Q
r

dT
dx

(2.17)

where A is the cross-sectional area, the subscript c denotes the metal

ʹ
 ̇
core, and
Q
r is the heat flux per unit length in the radial direction. This
equation indicates that the temperature of the metal core depends on the
boundary conditions. For this reason, considering only the energy con-
servation in the vicinity of flame front is insufficient in analyzing the
FSR of a wire. Nakamura et al. [78] introduced two non-dimensional
parameters: the Peclet number Pe = LVf/αc and Λ = 2πrcλsL2/(rAcλc)
to quantify the metal core heat conduction and the wire configuration.
Here, αc is the thermal diffusivity of metal core, L and r are the flame
characteristic length and wire radius, respectively. Hu et al. [79] pro-
posed a simplified model for the FSR over a wire, by linearizing the
metal core temperature based on the characteristic scales. This model
has been extended to more composite materials and more complex
environmental conditions [80–83], and successfully predicted the trend
of FSR with varying parameters, further confirming the significant role
of solid-phase heat conduction in the flame spread over a highly
conductive matrix.

A geometry effect, particularly the impact of surface curvature, in-
fluences significantly the flame spread [50,84]. As illustrated in Fig. 6,
two primary mechanisms are summarized in Ref. [85], explaining the
effect of surface curvature on the flame spread behaviors of cylindrical
and flat solids. Firstly, the curvature effect leads to a larger flame area
with respective to the solid surface, causing a higher heat supply from
the flame into the solid phase. Secondly, the curvature effect reduces the
volume of the solid that needs to be heated during flame spread,
resulting in a faster temperature increase in the solid phase. Conse-
quently, the cylindrical solid fuel potentially exhibits a higher FSR than
flat solids. These two mechanisms are characterized by two correction
factors:

half-thickness is about 5 mm in a conventional downward spread mode,
whereas the critical radius of PMMA rod is only 1.2 mm. Meanwhile, the
forward heat conduction becomes less important for a cylindrical solid
fuel.

2.3. Concurrent flame spread

The fundamental theory of concurrent flame spread is an extension
of the opposed flame spread theory. A research on the concurrent flame
spread focuses on the accurate prediction of the preheating length (Lpr)

ʹʹ
 ̇
and the heat flux distribution (
Q
f,x) [26]. Generally, the longitudinal
thermal diffusion length scale in a solid phase (Lsx) is inherently limited
by the large FSR for a concurrent flame spread. This behavior persists
even in an wire combustion under the normal gravity, where the metal
core, despite having a higher thermal diffusivity, does not significantly
affect the relatively small Lsx [89]. Therefore, a common assumption is

that the gas-phase heat supply from the flame acts as the primary driving
force for a concurrent flame spread, particularly when the impact of
finite-rate chemistry is considered to be negligible. The preheating
length refers to the extent of the diffusion flame formed by the “excess
pyrolysis gas” that is not entirely consumed within the pyrolysis zone. If
the radiative quenching can be ignored, this flame preheat length (Lf,pr)
depends on the fuel burning rate and the fuel-oxygen mixing rate [90,
91]. The following discussion will focus on the theory elucidating the
burning rate, the flame preheating length, and the resulting distribution
of heat flux.

variables [94].

The flame preheating length (Lf,pr) is the difference between the
flame length (Lf) and pyrolysis length (Lpy). The diffusion flame over
burning solid material is characterized by “low fuel momentum”, as the
fuel injection (from a condensed phase into ambient) is generally
smaller than the buoyant speed. The buoyancy effect on flame length
primarily influences the mixing between fuel and oxidizer, as well as the
distance fuel traveled during the fuel-consumption time. For laminar
flames, the fuel-oxidizer mixing primarily depends on molecular diffu-
sion [95,96]. Whereas for turbulent flames, it is controlled by entrain-
ment, which refers to the process wherein ambient oxidizer is drawn into
the reactive flow by vortices [61]. To simplify, the oxidizer entrainment
rate is often assumed to be proportional to the characteristic speed
within the flame (for example, the buoyant speed of a pool fire), with a
proportionality factor known as the “entrainment coefficient” (φ).

Most flame length models for burning material are developed for
infinitelywide solid plates, assuming one-dimensional
fuel-oxidizer
mixing. Nonetheless, several studies highlight the significance of lateral
heat-mass loss in determining flame length over a flat solid fuel [51,93,
97,98], suggesting that the lateral diffusion can reduce the flame length
for narrow solid plates. Based on the stoichiometric assumption (all fuel
vapors are consumed with the incoming oxidizer up to the flame tip),
Delichatsios [99], Quintiere et al. [100], and Gollner et al. [101] pro-
posed models for the stoichiometric turbulent and laminar flame lengths
over a vertical burning wall under the natural convection. Bhattacharjee
and Carmignani [102] proposed a flame length model in the opposed
flow. Ma et al. [89,94] and Guo et al. [55] further extend the theory to
the flame over a vertical cylindrical wire under the natural convection.

(2.23)

where the empirical constants m and n are typically larger for samples
with larger radius, as the flow along a cylinder becomes more two-
dimensional in nature as the radius increases, thereby mitigating the
air entrainment. Note that the combustion efficiency of solid materials
and fuel gases decreases rapidly near the extinction limit or when the
flame radiation is significant [103–106]. Then, the basic stoichiometric
assumption becomes inadequate, making it challenging to model the
flame length.

is primarily linked to Lpy and environmental parameters. An
empirical formula relating flame length to the pyrolysis length is pro-
posed as Lf∝Ln
py , which has been widely employed in concurrent flame
spread [109–112]. However, for a solid material with strong heat loss,
where B varies, further investigations are needed to ascertain this
empirical relationship.

The magnitude, component and distribution of the flame heat flux
are important in determining both the mass loss rate in the pyrolysis
zone and the net heat supply into the preheating zone. A functional
relationship between the total flame heat flux and non-dimensional
flame length (x/Lf) was measured for various solid materials in a
steady wall flame configuration under the natural convection [100,
113], as depicted in Fig. 8a. Similar relationships were also reported for
solid surfaces with arbitrary inclination [114,115]. Beyond the flame
tip, say x/Lf > 1, the heat flux decreased to below 4 kW/m2. Noted that
different definitions of the “flame tip” were used in literatures due to the
presence of intermittent- and continuous flame regions. Consalvi et al.
[108] emphasized that both these regions contribute to concurrent
flame spread. Therefore, applying a threshold value on the flame heat
flux of 10 kW/m2 to determine the boundary of the preheating zone is
considered as a appropriate choice.

Precise measurements of the flame heat flux and its components for
flames formed by a burning surface in vertical, inclined and forced flow
configurations, were conducted in Refs. [26,116–122], as shown in
Fig. 8b. The result indicates a marginal decay in the streamwise
convective heat flux along the centerline of a burning surface with
increasing flow developed distance. In contrast, the radiative heat flux
exhibited a gradual increase owing to the soot formation, then started
decrease. In a bench-scale concurrent flame spread, the convection
primarily governs the flame heat feedback. However, for larger scale
tests, flame radiation becomes important, e.g., flame radiation eventu-
ally constitutes 75 %–80 % of the total flame heat flux at a height of 76
cm [116]. Since the flame heat flux varies across the burning surface, it
reaches its peak at the point where the flame is closest to the surface. In
an upward flame spread, it peaks at flame leading point. With a forced
flow, despite flame leading point, another local maximum emerges at
the downstream flame attachment point, where a transition from
momentum-dominated to buoyancy-dominated regime occurs (i.e., the
Richardson number Rix = Grx/Re2

x approaches unity) [123].

2.4. Flammability boundary

In essence, the mechanisms governing flame extinction typically fall
into two categories for diffusion flames: quenching in a low stretch rate
regime and blow-off in a high stretch rate regime. These two mecha-
nisms lead to a U-shaped behavior, as shown in Fig. 9 for counterflow
flames of methane when plotted maximum flame temperature versus
stretch rate, and stagnation-point flow diffusion flames over a
condensed fuel when plotted LOC with stretch [124,125].

Quenching primarily describes an inhibitory effect by heat loss on
flame propagation. The phenomenon of “quenching diameter” is the
most typical manifestation of this mechanism, where the exothermic
rate of the chemical reaction must exceed the heat dissipation rate to
avoid flame quenching. In the context of flame spread over a solid ma-
terial, the stabilization of the flame leading edge is pivotal for flame
extinction. For opposed flame spread, the heat loss refers to the heat
dissipation experienced by the fuel-air mixture formed in the preheating
zone before it advances into the reaction zone (flame front). Conse-
quently, flame quenching typically occurs when the gas residence time
(Eq. (2.8)) is large, for instance, under a microgravity condition. For
concurrent flame spread, the flame quenching depends on the heat
release in exothermic reactions, the heat and radicals from the down-
stream diffusion flame diffused into the peak reactivity spot near flame
leading edge (flame kernel), as well as the gas-phase radiative heat loss
[126,127]. The geometry of the downstream diffusion flame, is an
important parameter to control the extinction of a concurrent flame. In
addition to the gas-phase heat loss, the solid-phase surface re-radiation
stands out as a significant component in the energy balance equation for
flame spread, constituting one of a crucial source of heat loss.

A blow-off operates on the mechanism that, when the flame speed is
smaller than a convection speed, thereby the reaction component cannot
complete the reaction within the residence time, leading to localized
low-temperature zones and flame extinction. Flame blow-off can be
effectively characterized by the Damk ̈ohler number (Da), as evidenced
by S-shape correlation between flame temperature and Da [128]. In both
opposed and concurrent flame spreads, the gas-phase residence time is
estimated in the vicinity of the flame leading edge (Eq. (2.8)), where the
fuel vapor initially encounters the oxygen. Notably, the buoyant speed at
the flame leading edge may be influenced by the overall flame scale, as
demonstrated by the self-blowoff during upward flame spread in the
normal gravity when the flame length increases [129,130].

The flammability of a solid material is commonly characterized by

the limiting oxygen concentration (LOC), which is defined as the mini-
mum oxygen level where a flame can sustain propagation over the
material [9]. The LOC for opposed flame spread over a typical thermally
thin material exhibits a U-shaped curve with increasing flow speed
[131], owing to the competition between quenching and blow-off. The
blow-off branch can be described by Da [57,65,132], whereas predicting
the quenching branch requires a clear understanding of the various
sources of heat losses. Surface re-radiation becomes a critical source of
heat loss as the flame heat flux reduces to a level comparable to it, driven
by the increasing flame standoff distance in low-speed flow conditions.
Takahashi and Bhattacharjee et al. [17,42,133–136] proposed a
simplified model to estimate the LOC of a thermally-thin solid fuel in
opposed spread mode, by incorporating the effects of
surface
re-radiation and flame stretch into Eq. (2.14):

described by the correction factor (1 (cid:0) 1 /Da). Except for the surface re-
radiation, the importance of gas-phase radiative heat loss in determining
the quenching branch was emphasized in Refs. [45,137,138]. This
gas-phase radiation is mainly emitted from water vapor, carbon dioxide
and fuel vapor within the reaction zone [139], since the soot formation
upstream of a flame front is minimal [140]. In case of cylindrical ma-
terials, the gas-phase radiation is more important than the surface
re-radiation [141], because the ratio of solid surface area to flame sur-
face area is smaller for cylinders as compared with flat materials [142]
(Fig. 6). To include the gas-phase radiation, Konno et al. [143] proposed

When estimating the blow-off branch in a high-speed flow regime, a
common assumption is Vr ≈ Vg,eff + Vb, given that the Vg,eff and Vb are
typically of magnitudes larger than Vf. As such, the energy equation for a
thermally-thin flat solid (Eq. (2.24)) is simplified into a linear function
of Vf, allowing the determination of the LOC at a given environment by
setting Vf equal to 0. However, this assumption may not hold when
predicting the quenching branch in a low-speed flow regime, where
Vg,eff, Vb and Vf are of similar magnitudes, which requires a more refined
calculation. Especially for a cylindrical solid, the energy equation (Eq.
(2.27)) becomes a non-linear function of Vf. As depicted in Fig. 10, the

curve moves to the lower right region. The critical intersection (fold
bifurcation point) signifies the minimized XO2 that will still provide a
unique and stable solution, or in other words, the LOC. Notably, the
critical Vf to induce flame quenching is larger than 0. This is attributed
to the decrease in the FSR, which significantly increases the gas resi-
dence time in the low-speed flow regime. Consequently, the enhanced
gas-phase radiation decreases the flame temperature, initiating a nega-
tive feedback loop that ultimately reduces the FSR and leads to flame
quenching. This negative feedback also exists for the solid with high
conductivity in the low-speed flow regime, where the decrease in Vf
causes the increase in solid-phase thermal diffusion length and the
corresponding surface re-radiation, resulting the flame quenching [56,
82,83,144–150]. Notably, near-limit combustion modeling based on
simplified scaling models is highly sensitive to input parameters and
scaling factors, so LOC predictions inevitably carry uncertainties. To
address this, a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)–based
method [317,318] is used to infer parameters and quantify model un-
certainty, providing safety margins for LOC predictions in terms of
confidence intervals.

3. Flame spread in low gravity

3.1. Flame spread in microgravity

3.1.1. Transient flame growth

This section begins with the ignition-to-spread transition in a
microgravity. In a quiescent microgravity environment, solid materials
are more easily ignited by external heating as compared with the normal
gravity. This is primarily because the absence of natural convective
cooling allows heat to accumulate on the solid surface and increases the
gas residence time of the combustible fuel-oxidizer mixture. Generally,
after ignition, self-sustained flame spread occurs when the total heat flux
received by the virgin solid surface can balance the heat loss (mainly
surface re-radiation) and the sensible heat required to preheat the un-
burned zone. However, in a low-speed convection environment, the
molecular diffusion of oxygen likely has a longer time scale compared to
fuel evaporation and chemical reactions. Thus, the formation of the
flame front becomes diffusion-controlled and may not survive without a
sufficient oxygen supply. This “smothering” effect significantly in-
fluences the transition and flame spread behaviors after ignition in
microgravity.

Kashiwagi and Olson et al. [151,152] reported experimental results
of a typical radiative spot ignition-to-spread transition over a flat thin
cellulose in microgravity (Fig. 11). In a quiescent condition, the

opposed flow over wires with NiCr core [166].

near-limit flame often fails to achieve a stable flame spread after ignition
and extinguishes due to smothering. However, when an external airflow
is present, even at a very weak speed of 0.5 cm/s for the thin plat fuel
[151], the upstream flame benefits from the increased oxygen supply
rate, forming an opposed flame spread having a fan-shape. The geom-
etry of this “fan-shape flame front” depends on the mass flux of oxygen
brought by the forced flow, and it results in a rapid expansion of hot
gases. It serves as a flexible barrier that drives out the forced flow and
deprives the downstream flame of oxygen, creating an “oxygen
shadow”. Therefore, the downstream flame front cannot propagate
initially, and lifts off the sample surface to seek oxygen, retreating into
an extended tail of the upstream flame. The downstream flame begins
concurrent spread only if the forced flow is relative strong, or if the
upstream flame is quenched [152,153].

For thermally thick materials, only opposed spread mode can be
observed over a 10-mm-diameter PMMA rod when ignited in the middle
of the sample in microgravity [154], even under an oxygen-enriched
condition. Furthermore, under a low-speed convection, the time scale
of lateral oxygen diffusion is comparable to that of its spreading direc-
tion. Numerical simulations [155] have shown that during subsequent
flame spread, two localized, small flames tend to form at the sample
edges, a phenomenon that can only be accurately captured using
three-dimensional models.

As compared to opposed flame spread, the concurrent mode typically
requires a longer time to achieve a steady spread state, where the flame
characteristic lengths remain constant. In microgravity as shown in
Fig. 12, the pyrolysis length of a spreading concurrent flame on a thin
narrow sample (green dotted lines with 5 cm wide samples) grows as the
flame develops and eventually reaches a limiting constant length when
the flame enters a steady state. However, for a relative wide sample
(solid lines), the pyrolysis length exhibits an “overshoot”, i.e., transient
excessive pyrolysis length, in the transitional stage [30,156]. Two pri-
mary reasons account for this “overshoot”: the first is the reduction in
effective flow speed as the flame propagates deeper into the developing
boundary layer; and the second arises from a post-ignition transient
flame growth, where the initial solid burnout time (Lf∕Vf) significantly
extends after ignition. After a long solid relaxation time, the preheating
length and pyrolysis length finally develop and stabilize. In subsequent
studies [35], this phenomenon was found to exist even for cotton fabric
that can burn away, indicating that the latter mechanism is, in fact,
dominant. Such a phenomenon does not occur in narrow samples
because the three-dimensional flame structure enhances lateral heat and
mass diffusion. As a result, both the flame length and preheating length
expand more slowly, allowing the solid phase to achieve a steady state in
a shorter relaxation time. During the flame spread process, the flame
temperature remains relatively stable, averaging around 1300 K [157].

3.1.2. Steady flame spread

The following sections discuss the effect of test variables on the pa-
rameters characterizing the steady flame spread in microgravity. Note
that achieving a true steady state is challenging due to the limited
duration of microgravity experiment. For instance, even though ther-
mally thin materials can reach a steady concurrent flame spread in
microgravity (Fig. 12), thermally thick materials require longer time due
to their extended relaxation time. Consequently, it is common practice
to average characteristic parameters, such as FSR, over the test interval.
Additionally, microgravity experiments are typically conducted in
closed chambers of limited size, which introduces effects related to the
confinements of the flow field and thermal expansion caused by heat and
mass addition in the chamber (discussed in detail in Section 5.4) [35].
These factors complicate and make it difficult to quantitatively compare
experimental data obtained by various researchers and apparatus.
Therefore, the following sections will focus on discussing the effects of
experimental parameters based on studies using the same equipment to
ensure consistency and reliability.

3.1.2.1. Effect of airflow direction and velocity. In an oxygen-enriched
microgravity environment with forced flow, a flame ignited from the
middle of a sample can develop into simultaneous upstream (opposed)
and downstream (concurrent) flame spreads. Due to the aforementioned
oxygen shadow effect, the upstream flame acts as a flexible barrier,
diverting the oxygen mass flow and resulting in the concurrent flame
spreading at a lower rate than the opposed flame (Fig. 13a) [158]. A
surface energy balance analysis in Ref. [153] indicated that the heat flux
of an opposed flame can be divided between the sensible heat (fuel heat
up) and surface re-radiation similarly, whereas that of a concurrent
flame is almost offset by the surface radiation. It causes surface tem-
perature gradients for the opposed flame are an order of magnitude
larger than those for the concurrent flame. Additionally, within the
appropriate Reynolds number range (30(cid:0) 50) by defining with forced
flow speed and burnt-out length of the sample, a pair of recirculation
cells is formed in the concurrent flame due to the interaction between
the forced flow, the thermal expansion from the flame, and the Stefan
flow from the pyrolyzing fuel [158]. This interaction produces an
opposed flame front even in the concurrent spread, causing the apparent
concurrent flame to propagate in an opposed mode. The reverse flow
near the downstream edge of the concurrent flame feeds more oxygen,
and pushes the flame closer to the sample surface, hence the FSR in-
creases significantly and becomes comparable to that of the opposed
FSR. This concurrent-opposed reversal phenomenon was also observed
in the concurrent flame spread over ultra-thin papers (with thickness
less than 0.08 mm) in microgravity [159] (Fig. 13b), but it is primarily
attributed to the FSR being larger than the low-speed airflow.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience111(2025)10125116

Y. Ma et al.

For individual opposed and concurrent flames in microgravity with a
low-speed flow for both Cu-core and NiCr-core wire flames, the con-
current flame spread is only slightly faster than that of the opposed one
[105,106,160,161], but the difference in the magnitude at the normal
gravity of these two flames were more significant [89]. This discrepancy
is primarily attributed to the increased residence time of soot production
in microgravity, which enhances radiative heat loss from the flame, as
well as the oxygen shadow effect, leading to a localized quenching at the
flame tip. As shown in Fig. 13c, the downstream flame opens in micro-
gravity, with a significant amount of soot leaking out from the flame.
Nagachi et al. [106] suggested that, only about 50 % of the fuel vapor
may be consumed by oxygen in microgravity. This shortens the flame
length as compared with the stoichiometric flame length, thereby sup-
pressing the rapid increase in concurrent FSR and reducing the chance of
flashover in a spacecraft. Therefore, when modeling flame length in
microgravity, it is essential to consider the changes in the volumetric
fraction of soot [103–105,161–163]. Meanwhile, when the flame
shortens due to radiative quenching, the longitudinal heat conduction
through a solid phase is expected to be important even for a concurrent
flame spread, because the thermal length in gas phase and solid phase
becomes comparable.

The evolutions of opposed FSRs over thermally thin paper with
varying flow velocities summarized by Olson [164] are shown in
Fig. 14a. The results indicated that the region where the opposed flame
spread can achieve steady state can be divided into three main con-
trolling regimes based on the opposed flow speed: (1) oxygen-transport
limited regime under
(2)
thermal-transport controlled regime where kinetics effect can be ignored
under moderate-speed
(3)
finite-rate-chemistry-controlled regime under high-speed flow (chemi-
cal regime). Under a low-speed flow, the flame and the corresponding
flame spread behavior are primarily influenced by the following three
mechanisms. First, the extension of preheating length (Eq. (2.4)) makes
the surface re-radiation become apparent [42,43,167]. Second, the
low-speed flow increases the residence time of high-temperature gases,
leading to higher gas-phase radiative heat loss thereby a lower flame
temperature [127,168]. Third, the oxidizer flowing into the reaction
zone per unit time reduces thus causes a smothering effect [155,164].
Therefore, although the low-speed regime is termed as the “O2-limited
regime”, it is crucial to acknowledge the important role of radiative heat
losses. In a concurrent flow, the FSR over a thin wire initially has a linear
relationship with the flow velocity, then reaches a plateau before
blow-off (Fig. 14b) [106,165]. Along this plateau region, the flame be-
comes unstable and exhibits strong oscillations due to flow stretch.
However, a rapid drop in the FSR near blow-off observed in an opposed
spread has not been observed for a concurrent spread.

3.1.2.2. Effect of oxygen concentration and pressure. Oxygen concentra-
tion (XO2) and pressure (P) are critical parameters in designing a man-
ned spacecraft. Depending on the feasibility of spaceflight engineering
and the physiological needs of the human body, various options exist for
the total atmospheric pressure and oxygen concentration within a space
capsule. Currently, the ISS maintains an atmospheric environment
similar to that of Earth’s surface (101.3 kPa, 21 vol% O2) [169]. The
pressure range within the crew compartment of the China Space Station
(CSS, Tiangong) is approximately 90–101 kPa with an oxygen level
range of 21–24 vol% [170]. During the design of the manned Lunar
landing spacecraft, the NASA, the Chinese Astronauts Research and
Training Center, and other institutions have recommended prioritizing a
low P (~58 kPa) and high XO2 (30(cid:0) 34 %) atmospheric environment.
This approach aims to accommodate living and working needs of as-
tronauts, such as reducing the probability of decompression sickness and
minimizing preparation time for extravehicular activities, while also
reducing oxygen consumption.

For most materials, both opposed and concurrent FSRs increase with

higher XO2, in both normal- and microgravity [16,65,154,171,172] (an
exception is observed in opposed flame spread over wires with highly
conductive cores [80]). A typical explanation for the increased FSR is
that enhanced flame heat supply to the material surface, due to higher
flame temperature, and increased chemical reaction rate. However, the
effect of XO2 can be more complex. Kobayashi et al. [172] found that,
although the preheating length (Lgx) as a function of XO2 is not captured
by the scaling model (Eq. (2.4)), the Lgx for opposed flame spread over
low density polyethylene (LDPE) sheets in microgravity increases with
XO2, thereby increases the FSR. This phenomenon can be explained by
two factors: (1) increased flame temperature changes the gas-phase
thermophysical properties, particularly the thermal diffusivity and (2)
higher XO2 reduces the flame standoff distance, resulting in the flame
front to interact with lower local flow speeds, thereby enhancing the
forward thermal diffusion distance. Additionally, solid fuels exhibit
higher oxidative pyrolysis activity at higher XO2.

A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) result indicated that materials
pyrolyze at lower temperatures in air as compared with a nitrogen at-
mosphere, which is equivalent to a lower pyrolysis temperature. In low-
speed oxygen-enriched microgravity, Wu et al. [154] observed that the
overall flame over a PMMA rod exhibits overall blue appearance with
multiple yellow flamelets. These yellow flames indicated localized
fuel-rich mixtures, resulting from fuel vapor gas and tiny droplets
ejected from bubble bursting on the solid surface. Given the suppressed
convection in microgravity, studying the effects of localized changes in
soot concentration on flame radiation could be a valuable topic for
future researches [168].

As compared to the effect of oxygen concentration, the FSR is less
sensitive to the changes in ambient pressure. For an opposed flame
spread, since the flame standoff distance and gas-phase thermal diffu-
sion length both exhibit inverse dependencies on P (Eq. (2.4)), the flame
heat supply into the solid fuel remains almost constant in the thermal
regime as P changes. Kikuchi et al. [173] reported that the opposed FSR
over a thin wire is independent of the pressure variation. Olson and
Miller [158] found that the FSR over a thin paper at 30 cm/s opposed
flow in both the normal- and micro-gravities can be correlated by Vf =
O2 P0.05 (cid:0) 1.15, except near the extinction limit, where Vf and P

where Vf and Vg in [cm/s] and P in [kPa].

For a concurrent flame spread, the FSR over a thin solid fuel shows a
clear monotonic increase with increasing P [158,171,175]. Olson and
Miller [158] suggested that this accelerated FSR is due to the enhanced
flame heat flux, and the FSR is a function of VgXO2P0.5. Numerical
simulations by Li et al. [175] indicated that the average net heat flux
received by a solid fuel is insensitive to the ambient conditions (i.e.,
oxygen concentration, flow speed, pressure). In this regard, they sug-
gested that the accelerated FSR might be attributed to the changes in
flame length with ambient conditions, and proposed a new FSR corre-
lation for thermally thin materials as Vf = C1(XO2 /  ̇m
C2) ×
XO2VgP/ρsτ. Guibaud et al. [104,105,161] used advanced optical di-
agnostics to investigate the role of soot-related radiation in an opposed
flame spread over wires in microgravity. They reported that the soot
production rate is one-third order in P and very sensitive to XO2.
Increasing XO2 and P can trigger the transition from a non-sooting to a
sooting flame. For charring materials, the concurrent FSR has a stronger
dependence on P in microgravity as compared to non-charring materials
[176]. So far, due to the difficulty of reaching a steady state during a
limited microgravity time, there are no studies on the effect of ambient
pressure on thermally thick materials in microgravity.

3.1.2.3. Effect of sample properties. The effect of sample thickness on
flame spread in microgravity has been insufficiently addressed. This is
because thick samples typically exhibit a non-uniform internal temper-
ature distribution in solid phase, requiring a longer relaxation time to

achieve a steady state. West et al. [177] reported that the FSR over a
thick PMMA decreases with time in a quiescent, oxygen-enriched at-
mosphere in microgravity. This reduction is attributed to significant
surface radiation heat losses, which introduce a negative feedback
mechanism in the flame spread system. Numerical simulations [43]
indicate that when a sample thickness exceeds a critical value, the flame
in quiescent microgravity will eventually extinguish, even in a pure
oxygen atmosphere. This critical thickness has been expressed as [42,43,

where s is the fuel-air stoichiometric ratio. The difference between the
two expressions lies in how the flame heat flux is calculated. Addition-
ally, Vetturini et al. [159] investigated the effect of area density of

cellulose paper on the concurrent flame spread. Within the range of their
tests, the FSR was inversely proportional to the area density. The con-
current spreading flame in low-speed flow in microgravity is relatively
short. Both thin and thick samples may reach their flame limiting
lengths. For thin samples, upstream burnout results in a constant size
steady spread rate (both the flame tip and flame bottom move with the
same rates). But, in thick sample, the flame becomes stationary and
non-spreading [30,51,178].

In microgravity, the absence of convection and the prolonged gas-
phase residence time enhance the significance of lateral oxygen and
fuel diffusion (a three-dimensional effect) on flame spread, particularly
influenced by the sample width. For an opposed flame spread, Olson
et al. [179] and Zhu et al. [144] found that the smothering effect causes
the continuous flame front for both thermally thin and thick materials to
split into separate flamelets, resulting in a “fingering spread”. For a
concurrent flame spread, Li et al. [156] discovered that limited oxygen
supply increases the flame standoff distance for wide planar samples (41
cm width), reducing the convective heat feedback from the flame to the

material surface and thereby reducing the FSR as compared to narrow
samples (5 cm width). However, Zhao et al. [180] reported an opposite
result that the concurrent FSR over a sample with 1.2 cm width is
smaller than that over a sample with 2.2 cm width. This discrepancy
may be attributed to lateral diffusion, which can result in a fuel loss for a
narrow sample. Furthermore, numerical results [171,181] indicated
that the concurrent flame spread over narrow samples is more sensitive
to the changes of gas-phase kinetics as compared to wide samples.

Sample curvature effects are usually more significant in microgravity
due to a larger flame standoff distance as compared to the normal
gravity. Fujita et al. [166] discovered that at extremely low airflow
speeds (<20 cm/s) in microgravity, the opposed FSR over NiCr-core
initially increasing and
wires exhibits a non-monotonic evolution,
then decreasing as the flow speed decreases (Fig. 14c). This behavior
was unique because planar thin materials in oxygen-enriched environ-
ment did not exhibit a similar trend (Fig. 14a). They attributed this
phenomenon to the curvature effect, which inhibits the reduction of
flame heat feedback with increasing flame standoff distance and

suppresses the smothering effect when the flow speed decreases. Addi-
tionally, the increased gas-phase preheating length induced by low flow
speeds collectively leads to the acceleration of the FSR. Similar phe-
nomena were observed by Wu et al. [154] and Link et al. [16] in their
studies under oxygen-limited environments.

In addition, there are several studies of more complex sample con-
figurations in microgravity. Kumar et al. [182] studied an opposed flame
spread over thin hollow cylindrical fuels in microgravity, and reported
that the FSR is larger for samples with larger diameter due to more
sufficient oxygen supply. Carney et al. [183] studied a concurrent flame
spread over thin discrete fuels and reported that the burning rate de-
creases monotonically with increasing gap size in microgravity, whereas
in 1 g, the burning rate first increases and then decreases with gap size as
the laterally-entrained buoyancy flow pushes the flame closer to the
sample surface when gaps are present. Olson et al. [184] compared a
concurrent flame spread over two thick PMMA, one sample was a 10 mm
thick flat slab, while the other was a 10 mm thick flat sample that had a
4 mm thick grooved at the center section. They reported that the

spreads [193].

grooved sample developed a deep inverted-V shaped notch as the thin
center section burned first, hence facilitate the development of the flame
spread.

3.1.3. Near-limit flame spread

“Near-limit” typically refers to conditions that approach the mini-
mum threshold at which a flame can sustain a continuous spread. In
some literatures, weak flames that can spread briefly before extinction
are also referred to as near-limit flames. These near-limit flames typi-
cally exist under low-oxygen, low-pressure, and low-speed convection
conditions. In this case, finite-rate chemical reaction (low Damk ̈ohler
number effect) gradually dominates the flame spread behaviors due to
increased radiative heat loss and limited oxidizer feed rate. A basic
phenomenon is that the two-dimensional flame breaks up into separate
tiny, fingering flamelets to expand the specific surface area of the flame
and to increase the surface curvature. This structural change results in
an increased rate of oxygen supply and stronger thermal feedback from
the flame to solid fuel surface, which helps to maintain continued for-
ward propagation [185].

Olson et al. [131] and Ramachandra et al. [187] started to investi-
gate the near-limit opposed flame spread behaviors over thermally-thin
samples in microgravity from 1980s to 1990s. More recently, Takahashi
et al. [136,186] revisited this problem using the Solid Combustion
Experiment Module (SCEM) of ISS with an infrared thermometry. In
their experiments with a thin filter paper, the flame exhibited a

transition from a linear two-dimensional (2D) to a three-dimensional
(3D) spherical shape (flamelet) as the forced flow speed decreased
(Fig. 15a). In extremely low opposed flows, the flame diameter pro-
gressively diminished during the spread. For these flamelets, the pre-
heating length is not only controlled by the forced flow speed (Vg) (Eq.
(2.4)), but also depends on the size of flamelet, which is essentially a
complex function of fuel area density, Vg and fuel Lewis number [188].
Fig. 15b shows that the preheating lengths for Vg < 6 cm/s are smaller
than the theoretical value (blue line with Eq. (2.4)), and approaches to
about 30 mm in the quiescent condition. Because of the decreased pre-
heating length and suppressed surface re-radiation, the flame managed
to continue spreading for a significant duration (~50 s) despite the
reduction in the forced flow, ultimately extinguishing in the quiescent
condition. Furthermore, a vapor cloud composed of tar and oil was
observed above the filter paper. This is because the reduced diameter of
the flamelet causes the increase in stretch rate of flame peripheries, and
some pyrolysis gas cannot burn, which diffuses and generates a vapor
cloud (Fig. 16a). This vapor cloud ignited and burned explosively as the
flame approached it in a relatively high oxygen level. Therefore, the
accumulation of
the pyrolysis mist can cause a fire hazard in
microgravity.

Zhu et al. [144,189] investigated the near-limit opposed flame
spread over a thermally-thick PMMA (61.6 mm long × 50 mm wide ×
10 mm thick) in microgravity aboard the SJ-10 satellite. Similar to
thermally-thin materials, the near-limit flame over thermally-thick

core in 10 cm/s opposed flow [195].

Y. Ma et al.

materials had a transition from a continuous flame to flamelets
(Fig. 16b) as the flow speed decreased. During this transition, flame
oscillations occurred due to the large solid-phase relaxation time.
However, unlike thermally-thin materials, thermally-thick materials
cannot burn out completely. Before extinction, the flame front stops
spreading forward and slowly recedes in the opposite direction
(Fig. 16c), where the thermal scale of the flame is dominated by the
radiation while the mass diffusion scale is unaffected by radiation. The
diffusion scale grows in time as compared with the thermal scale such
that eventually, oxygen supply is insufficient, and ultimately extinction
occurs [137]. Such near-limit flamelets exist in a certain range of flow
speeds and oxygen levels, which represents a steady-state structure that
emerges after the initial uniform 2D flame becomes unstable.

Near-limit concurrent flame spread over a thin composite cotton-
fiberglass fabric blend (SIBAL fabric, thickness of about 0.32 mm and
area density of 18.2 mg/cm2) was observed by Zhao et al. [180] inside
the Microgravity Science Glovebox in ISS, as shown in Fig. 17a. As the
forced flow speed turned down, the concurrent flame shrinks into a
circular-shaped blue flame. This exhibits a similar flamelet character-
istic in near-limit opposed flame spread of thermally-thin filter paper as
discussed above [186]. Both the heat fluxes from the flame into the solid
and the surface re-radiation decrease during these processes, but the
former one decreases more rapidly hence leads to flame quenching. The
quenching airflow speeds were between 1 and 5 cm/s. For ultra-thin
papers with area density ranging from 0.2 to 13 mg/cm2, Vetturini
et al. [159] reported a unique tubular structure at the flame base
directed upstream away from the burnout zone when the area density of
paper was extremely low (Fig. 17b). This structure resulted from the
flame stretching and localized blowoff caused by the oxidative pyrolysis
in the Stefan flow regions at the sample burnout. This flow jet can locally
stretch the flame base beyond the flammability limit, creating a hole.
The total burning rate of the sample decreases with the area density for
thin samples. If the fuel concentration locally becomes too low, the

reaction rate decreases, and the stretch rate required to blow off flame
decreases accordingly. Therefore, for an ultra-thin sample, the flame
stretch induced by fuel blowing would extinguish a flame. Furthermore,
due to the longer microgravity time required for the combustion of thick
materials, there documented cases of near-limit concurrent flame spread
remain extremely limited. Very recent studies [190,191] have reported
the concurrent flame spread over PMMA spheres on ISS, and more de-
tails will be discussed in Section 6.3.

3.1.4. Flammability boundary

To ensure fire safety in manned space missions, NASA has estab-
lished specific fire safety standards (NASA-STD-6001B, last updated in
2011) [18]. These standards are based on experiences from past
spacecraft fire incidents and are designed for worst-case fire scenarios.
In NASA STD 6001B, Test 1 (ISO 14624–1) and Test 4 (ISO 14624–2) are
typical screening methods for common materials and electrical wires,
respectively. These tests evaluate whether the upward flame spread can
pass a specific distance under natural convection, as schematically
shown in Fig. 18. However, the drawbacks of Tests 1 and 4 are that their
results are applicable only to the specific conditions tested, and these
tests are conducted at 1G. They cannot provide more information
beyond “pass” or “not pass” [9].

To overcome this limitation in the fire safety standards, the concept
of limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) has been introduced. Typically,
LOC is evaluated by the limiting oxygen index (LOI) method (ISO
4589–2, ASTM 2863) [9,192]. By testing the LOC of a material in
various environments and identifying the minimum LOC (MLOC), cor-
responding to the most unfavorable condition where the material may
burn, this approach provides valuable references for screening space-
craft materials and designing the atmosphere of spacecraft cabin.

The classical results of LOC of a typical thermally thin paper, were
first reported by Olson et al. [131]. Recently, Takahashi et al. [136,186]
revisited this problem using ISS experiments and checked more details

of the two- and three-dimensional structures of the flame as they were
extinguished (Fig. 19a). The LOC exhibits a U-shaped behavior with
increasing opposed flow speed, indicating two main control mecha-
nisms: the quenching branch at low flow speeds and the blow-off branch
at high flow speeds. Note that the smothering effect also exists in the
quenching branch, especially at very low flow speeds. These findings
indicate that even though a material could meet NASA STD 6001B
standards, there is no assurance that its low flammability will be pre-
served when convection boundary conditions change, especially in
microgravity.

The LOI method typically employs a downward/opposed flame
spread mode because it is more controllable and easier to model than a
concurrent flame spread. However, the simulation results of Kumar et al.
[193] (Fig. 19b) indicated that the LOC for a concurrent flame spread is
typically lower and has a smaller MLOC as compared to opposed flame
spread. Therefore, the experimental results of the downward opposed
flame spread may not be conservative because it may not detect the
more severe conditions that could occur.

Correlating LOCs under various environments is necessary. For
instance, Hu et al. [194] reported that the LOC of an inclined electrical
wire first increases, then decreases, and finally increases again with the
airflow speed. The first local maximum in this trend marks the transition
from opposed to concurrent flame spread. They successfully extended
the LOC measured under the normal gravity (at various inclination an-
gles and opposed-flow air speeds) to LOC predictions for microgravity.

3.1.4.1. Effect of ambient atmosphere and external radiation. Investi-
gating the relationship between the LOC and ambient pressure, partic-
ularly comparing the limiting oxygen partial pressure (LOPP) under
normoxic conditions (21 kPa of oxygen partial pressure, suitable for
human living) and hypoxic conditions (16 kPa of oxygen partial pres-
sure, required for human living) is of great significance for the design of
spacecraft cabin atmospheres. Nagachi et al. [195] reported that the
LOC of the opposed flame spread over a LDPE-insulated wire with
NiCr-core in microgravity, increases with reduced ambient pressure due
to enhanced radiative heat loss from increased residence time in both
the solid and gas phases (Fig. 20). However, the LOPP decreases as the
ambient pressure decreases, and even the LOPP is always lower than
hypoxic condition in low pressure region. Ries et al. [174] also found
that, along the normoxic curve, the opposed FSR over a thin paper
significantly increases with increasing oxygen level and decreasing

pressure. Therefore, to design the next-generation spacecraft cabin with
a low-pressure, oxygen-enriched atmosphere presents a significant
challenge in balancing the material flammability requirements, the
aerospace engineering feasibility, and the physiological needs of
astronauts.

Takahashi et al. [135] and Tsuboi et al. [196] examined the effect of
dilution gases (N2, Argon, and CO2) on the LOC in opposed flame spread
over thin PMMA sheets. The results show that the MLOC is lowest with
Ar balance, making the fire hazard risk most severe with this diluent gas.
Due to the significant gas-phase radiative absorption of CO2, the solid
surface re-radiation is diminished, causing the blowoff branch to occur
at lower flow speeds in microgravity. As compared to CO2, Ronney and
coworkers [197,198] pointed out that Helium could be more suitable
than CO2 as an inert agent used in spacecraft due to its higher Lewis
number in oxygen (causes a lower FSR), higher thermal conductivity
and diffusivity (causes thicker flames with greater radiative loss, radi-
ative non-participation (neither reabsorbs nor re-emits thermal radia-
tion), storage efficiency (lower molar weight), physiological inactivity
(cannot impact respiration) and low solubility in water (reduces the risk

radiation also offsets

[199]. For
LDPE-insulated wires,
the burning white-LDPE-insulation becomes
semi-transparent during the glass transition. In this state, the external
radiation penetrates the insulation and is absorbed or reflected by the
inner metal core [200]. Compared to a black PE insulation wire, this
in-depth radiation through the semi-transparent PE to the inner metal
core acts as an additional cooling effect, resulting in a higher LOC for
white-PE-insulated wires.

3.1.4.2. Effect of sample properties and flame-retardant additives. For an
opposed flame spread, variations in thermophysical properties of ma-
terial and thickness typically affect the LOC by altering the solid phase
residence time, which influences radiative heat loss from the solid sur-
face. Takahashi and coworkers [17,148,172,201] reported that mate-
rials with higher pyrolysis temperatures and larger thicknesses usually
have higher LOCs. Additionally, the quenching branch and the MLOC
shift to a higher flow speed region, because the increased surface
re-radiation and slower FSR are more likely to trigger negative feedback
in the flame spread system. However, the blow-off branch seems less
sensitive to pyrolysis temperature, especially in high-flow regimes, as it

is dominated by flow stretch. Their calculations also indicated that
materials with a pyrolysis temperature over 823 K exhibit an MLOC in
the normal gravity, while other materials have an MLOC only in
microgravity. Electrical wires [147,149,200] and other high-conductive
materials (such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) [202–204])
demonstrated similar behaviors, where the increased solid phase ther-
mal diffusion length causes significant radiative heat loss. In addition,
for high thermal conductivity materials, the long relaxation time of the
solid phase and the limited test time and scale in microgravity render the
effect of ignition energy more significant. The LOC decreases mono-
tonically and tends to an asymptotic value as the ignition energy in-
creases [192,205].

The first space-based experiment on solid combustion aboard Skylab
[206] reported a test with nylon material burned for nearly 11 min in a
quiescent atmosphere with 65 % O2 at 35.85 kPa before astronauts
extinguished it by evacuating the chamber. The result revealed that
solid-phase vapor jetting from the boiling molten layer induced pulsa-
tions in the sooty flame hence sustained a near-limit combustion. In
contrast, materials lacking such vapor jetting tend to self-extinguish in a
quiescent environment due to the accumulation of combustion products
[129]. Further testing in microgravity with materials like Nylon Velcro
[207] and PMMA spheres [208] also showed vigorous and disrupted
burning behaviors attributed to fuel vapor jetting. Materials that melt
and produce significant vapor jetting during combustion are thus
considered more hazardous in a spacecraft. In this regard, understand-
ing the characteristics of molten layers of burning materials is crucial.
Intumescent flame retardants, such as expandable graphite (EG) and

ammonium polyphosphate/pentaerythritol (AP), form an intumescent
layer on the pyrolysis zone surface during opposed flame spread. This
layer bends downstream under gravity, creating an expanded carbon
barrier on the material surface, which inhibits flame spread by slowing
heat and mass transfer between the gases and the condensed phase.
However, in microgravity, Li et al. [209] found that the addition of EG
and AP into a thin LDPE rod does not change the LOC or FSR, because
above mentioned gravity-induced protection effect is absent. Further-
more, the intumescent matrix acts as a porous medium on the material
surface, pushing the molten fuel toward the flame via capillary action. In
microgravity, molten droplets do not drip, preventing additional airflow
that could blow off the flame. The combustion of silicon-based materials
produces a significant amount of silica ash, which, in microgravity,
deposits on the material surface. This deposition impedes heat and mass
transfer, thus affecting the flammability. Rojas-Alva et al. [210] sug-
gested that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes might be less
flammable in microgravity than in 1 g due to the transport and depo-
sition of silica ash, especially in a concurrent flame spread.

3.2. Flame spread in partial gravity

Compared to microgravity combustion experiments, studies on
partial-gravities relevant to celestial bodies such as the Mars and Moon
have been relatively less studied, gaining attention only recently with
the advent of extraterrestrial human habitat programs. As demonstrated
in Fig. 21, the partial-gravity environments are typically created in four
main ways: 1) A small centrifugal device is integrated into a

Fig. 24. Flame spread in low pressures: (a) thin LDPE-insulated wires [94,140]; (b) upward flame spread over thin cotton fabric with concurrent flow of 20 cm/s
[225], and thick PMMA [110].

microgravity experimental setup, such as drop tower. By adjusting the
rotational speed of the centrifuge, centrifugal acceleration equivalent to
partial gravity is generated during the free-fall period of the drop
capsule. 2) A smoother trajectory in parabolic airplane flights retains
residual gravity, creating a partial-gravity environment lasting tens of
seconds. 3) A drag force is controlled to counteract the gravity in a drop
tower by adopting methods such as counterweight [211], servo motor
[212], special “yo-yo” structure [213], and electro-magnetic drive sys-
tem [214,215], allowing the test package to fall with a prescribed ac-
celeration. 4) Experiments are conducted on an inclined smooth surface
[216], where the gravitational acceleration component parallel to the
surface is minimized, leaving only the perpendicular component to
simulate a partial-gravity environment. Additionally, partial gravity
tests can also be conducted in situ on the surfaces of the Moon and Mars.
These experiments can be remotely controlled. For example, the Chinese
Chang’e 4 lunar lander carried the Biological Experiment Payload (BEP)
and conducted the first biological experiments on the far side of the
Moon [217]. Given the high cost of long-duration low-gravity experi-
ments, the ground-based centrifuge also provide an alternative by
generating hypergravity to investigate gravity effects [55,56,317,318].

3.2.1. Flame spread

So far, opposed flame spread researches in partial gravities are still
limited to thermally-thin materials. In an opposed flame spread, the
reduction in the buoyancy decreases the induced flow speed at the flame
front. Similar to the decrease in opposed flow speed, the reduction in the
buoyant flow speed increases the gas-phase residence time (Eq. (2.8)),
thereby suppressing the flame stretch effect, but simultaneously in-
creases the preheating length and the resultant radiative heat losses.
West et al. [33] were the first to numerically investigate the effect of
gravity levels on the downward flame spread over a thermally-thin flat
paper in various gravity levels. They reported that with the increase in
gravity level (i.e., buoyant flow speed), the FSR exhibits a similar

radiation branch and stretch branch as observed in an opposed flame
spread (Fig. 14a), with the FSR peaking in a specified partial gravity. It
indicates that the fire development in partial gravities could be more
dramatic for this material. Sacksteder et al. [32,220] further confirmed
the above mentioned competition between the surface re-radiation and
flame stretch using parabolic flights. As shown in Fig. 22a, the gravity
associated with the peak FSR decreases with decreasing oxygen level.
This is because, at lower oxygen levels, the flame stretch effect begins to
dominate and control the FSR in a lower gravity level. Despite the sur-
face re-radiation, Chen et al. [221] emphasized the role of the gas-phase
radiative heat losses in downward flame spread over thin flat samples in
partial gravity, particularly its significance in flame quenching.

Apart from the gravity response of the gas phase, the gravity
response of the condensed phase, such as the dripping of the molten
layer in thermoplastic materials, is also a practical concern. Li et al. [54]
and Konno et al. [160] investigated opposed flame spreads over
LDPE-insulated electrical wire in partial gravity. These results demon-
strated that the FSR with NiCr-core wire having thin insulation peaks in
a certain partial gravity, resembling the inverse-U shape of FSR with
gravity level for a thermosetting material (such as paper). For a wire
with a thick insulation layer, combining the data from hypergravity
experiments of Guo et al. [55], the gravity level for the peak FSR shifts to
a higher gravity level. This shift occurs because thick samples typically
exhibit a stronger dripping behavior (Fig. 22b), which imparts more heat
to the preheating zone, thus suppressing the flame stretch effect.
Therefore, for thermoplastic materials, the FSR curve shows a “drip-
ping-driven” branch at low gravity and a “stretch-controlled” branch as
gravity increases [56].

For a concurrent/upward flame spread, Feier et al. [222] conducted
experiments on the upward flame spread over thermally thin papers in
reduced-pressure and partial-gravity environments using parabolic
flight tests. Unlike the downward FSR, which peaks in a certain partial
gravity, the upward FSR (Fig. 22a), the pyrolysis length and preheating
length all increased monotonically with increasing gravity level up to 1
g, even under low pressures where finite-rate chemistry effects may be
significant. This suggested that the upward flame spread is affected by
more intense surface re-radiation resulted from the longer flame pre-
heating lengths. In addition, Jiang et al. [223] emphasized the effect of
gas-phase radiative heat loss on the upward flame spread in partial
gravity, noting its role in reducing both flame lengths and temperatures.

Sacksteder et al. [32,220] pioneered parabolic flight tests to study
the LOC for downward flame spread over thin papers under quiescent
conditions. They observed a monotonic increase in the LOC with
increasing gravity levels across a range from 0.05 to 4.25 g (Fig. 23a). In
addition, their calculations showed that the LOC increased rapidly with
decreasing gravity levels from 10
the
LOC-gravity curve demonstrates a U-shape, similar to typical LOC-flow
speed curves. Ferkul and Olson [218], and Olson and Ferkul [224]
examined the LOC of concurrent flame spreads over three thin materials
(Ultem® 1000, Nomex® HT90-40, and Mylar® G/Melinex® 515) in the
normal-, Martian-, Lunar-, and micro-gravities. They observed a clear
U-shaped LOC curve with increasing gravity levels, with the MLOC
occurring at about the Lunar gravity (0.16 g). Furthermore, the
gravity-response of molten droplet make the LOC trend of a thermo-
plastic material with gravity level becomes more complicated. As shown
in Fig. 23b, Li et al. [54] and Konno et al. [160] reported that for a wire
with a thicker LDPE-insulation layer, the LOC of opposed flame spread
over NiCr-core wire initially increases and then decreases as gravity
level rises from 0 to 1 g. This wire demonstrated a higher LOC compared
to Cu-core wire, except under microgravity conditions. They attributed
this unexpected trend to variations in fuel concentration gradient near
flame front (triple flame), caused by the cyclic behavior of molten
droplets of LDPE.

4. Flame spread in a low-pressure environment

4.1.1. Opposed flame spread

In a flame spread over solid surface, gases are typically assumed to
behave as incompressible fluids. Decreasing the ambient pressure re-
duces the gas density, which in turn increases the kinematic viscosity
and effectively reduces the Grashof number of the system. This has the
effect of suppressing buoyancy, similar to reducing the gravity level.
This chapter will present the basic characteristics of flame spread in low
pressures, analyze the mechanisms by which pressure affects the char-
acteristic parameters, and conclude with a discussion of the principles
for simulating low-gravity environments at low pressures, along with
their limitations.

4.1. Effect of ambient pressure on flame spread

Typical flame spread phenomena in low pressures are shown in
Fig. 24. In a low pressure, the boundary layer thickness increases while
the oxygen partial pressure decreases, leading to a faster diffusion of
gaseous fuel species from the solid surface. For example, in a downward
flame spread over a LDPE wire [140], the flame length decreases in low
pressures, and the flame becomes thicker, causing the overall flame
shape to have a transition from a slender “spindle” shape at 101 kPa to a
more “spherical” shape, similar to flames observed in a microgravity.
However, the soot formation in fuel-rich combustion is suppressed in a
low pressure, resulting in a rapid reduction of the bright yellow lumi-
nous region at the top of a flame, while the blue-green region at the base
(excited C2* radicals in the high-temperature zone) gradually extends
downstream. The smothering effect (i.e., “oxygen shadow” effect) and
soot-related radiative quenching typically causes an open downstream
flame tip in micro- and partial-gravities (Fig. 13c). However, these ef-
fects appear negligible in low pressures, where the flame tip exhibits a
smooth and closed contour.

An upward/concurrent flame typically has a larger size and exhibits
more turbulent structures as compared to an opposed flame. As pressure
decreases, a concurrent flame shifts from a bright yellow/orange color to
a faint purple/orange hue (Fig. 24b), with diffused and indistinct flame
tips. Turbulence and flickering at the flame tip gradually diminish, and
the flame standoff distance becomes larger. Under the normal pressure,
the blue luminescence of CH* radicals in the flame are obscured by
strong soot emissions. However, at low pressures, the suppression of soot
formation allows the blue region to be observed. For a thin cotton fabric,
the visible flame length diminishes, whereas LDPE wires (Fig. 24a) show
significantly increased flame length due to intense burning during
molten LDPE droplet drips. For a thick PMMA slab, the significant solid
phase heat conduction leads to a lower fuel burning rate, thus the flame
becomes weaker and exhibits blue color.

Since the gas density is proportional to pressure, a decrease in
pressure will inevitably lead to a decrease in the thermal diffusivity
(cid:0) 1). In a downward flame spread, the scaling analysis in section
(αg∝P
2.1 indicates the local flow speed imposed to the flame front is [45,140]:

(4.1)

This suggests that the local buoyancy speed increases as pressure
decreases. However, noted that the overall phenomena would be more
dominated by diffusion process in very low-pressure environments
because the increased diffusion is more important than the increased
buoyancy speed. The FSR over various solid materials in low pressures at
1 g are summarized in Fig. 25. Downward FSRs decrease with the
reduction in ambient pressure (i.e., increasing buoyant flow speed),
particularly for thick materials. This trend contrasts with de Ris’s model
(Eq. (2.13)), which suggests that opposed FSR is less sensitive to flow
speed for thin materials, whereas it increases with flow speed for thick
materials. The reason for this discrepancy is that ambient pressure also
alters the structure of the flame front. The net heat flux (Eq. (2.14)) is
determined by three main parameters: the gas-phase thermal diffusion
length (Lgx), standoff distance of flame front (Lgy), and flame tempera-
ture (Tf) [45,140]. Under

This suggests that Lgx is enlarged in low pressure (also low gravity).
The flame standoff distance (Lgy) is typically assumed to be identical to
Lgx in a scaling analysis. If the partially-premixed nature of flame front is
considered, Lgy is approximately proportional to Lgx, with a propor-
tionality coefficient determined by the equivalence ratio of flame front
and the surface curvature [140]. As a result, the local flame heat flux is
expected to decrease in low pressures because of the larger flame
standoff distance, which suppresses the increase in total flame heat flux
into preheating zone from larger Lgx. Radiative heat loss in gas phase is
enhanced in low pressures due to the enlarged gas residence time:

(4.3)

Therefore, Tf in low pressure is cooled by the radiation from water
vapor and carbon dioxide (note that the soot-related radiation can be
negligible at the flame front but it is important in the downstream flame
[140,163]). Although the change in Tf may not be appreciable, for
instance, Tf of an LDPE-insulated wire decreases from 1576 K at 101 kPa
to 1404 K at 40 kPa [140], the gas-phase radiation may be important
contributing to flame extinction in low pressure, as approaching to the
critical temperature for a flame to remain stable.

Sample configuration is important to determine the opposed FSR in
low pressure. He et al. [229] investigated the effect of sample width, and
found that as the width increases, the FSR over a horizontal thin paper
first increases and then stabilizes. It is due to significant lateral
heat-mass loss in narrower samples, which introduces an additional
kinetics effect. Meanwhile, the wider samples are more sensitive to the
ambient pressure, although the reasons for this phenomenon are not yet
fully understood. For solid materials with the highly conductive matrix,
such as electrical wires, the relationship between solid-phase and
gas-phase thermal diffusion lengths becomes crucial as pressure varies
(Fig. 26). Nakamura et al. [230] reported that during flame spread over
horizontal LDPE-wires, the gas-phase thermal length can exceed the
solid-phase thermal length as pressure decreases, leading to a transition
from a “wire-driven mode” to a “flame-driven mode” in low pressures.
Hu et al. [231] found that the transition pressure between the two modes
decreases with increasing diameter of the metal core. This implies that
for wires with significant solid-phase heat conduction, the “flame-driven
mode” occurs only at lower ambient pressures.

4.1.2. Concurrent flame spread

For the concurrent/upward flame spread in low pressures, the FSRs
are more sensitive to the ambient pressure compared to opposed/
downward flame spread. Irrespective of whether the sample is thermally

thin or thick, the FSRs decrease monotonically with the reduction in
pressure (Fig. 25), and are more sensitive to pressure in lower oxygen
concentration [232]. One exception is that the FSRs over LDPE-insulated
wires increase with the decrease in pressure until extinguishing at
around 20 kPa [94]. These trends are consistent with the flame length
evolution with pressure as indicated in Fig. 24. Flame length (Lf) and

heat flux distribution (

factors influencing the convective-controlled concurrent flame spread
(Section 2.3). Therefore, the concurrent flame spread behaviors in low
pressure will be understood in the following through the controlling
mechanism of ambient pressure on these two parameters.

4.1.2.1. Flame length. For a convection-controlled flame where radia-
tive quenching and kinetics effect are negligible, the diffusion flame
length (Lf) is determined by the rate of fuel supply and oxidizer inflow
(including molecular diffusion and entrainment). Based on the solution
as
of
Lf∝vfL2/(DL +DT) [233], where vf is the characteristic fuel speed in the
flame plume, L is the characteristic scale of the fire source, DL is the
molecular diffusivity and DT is the turbulent momentum diffusivity. For
a laminar flame, the molecular diffusion dominates, and DL has a pres-
(cid:0) n with 1 < n < 2. For a turbulent flame, the
sure dependence of DL∝P
entrainment effect controls the fuel-air mixing, and DT has a positive
pressure dependence. Therefore, laminar flame length and turbulent
flame length have opposite pressure dependencies. For diffusion flames
over a horizontal fuel with hydrocarbon liquid, Most et al. [233]
observed that the flame length with a HRR of 1.02 kW, increases with
pressure, following an pressure exponent of 0.16 for pressures below 80
kPa. Conversely, for the pressures above 80 kPa, the flame length de-
(cid:0) 0.5. These results indicate that a
creases with an exponent of
laminar-turbulent transition occurs when varying ambient pressure,
even for a low-momentum pool fire with a given fuel supply rate (HRR).
Literatures [89,107,108] indicated that the onset of turbulence can be
characterized by a critical width-normalized HRR, which are found to be
within the range of 20–30 kW/m for 101 kPa (Fig. 7). However, for
flames in various ambient pressures, this criterion remains questionable.
For instance, small eddy structures were observed in a pool fire with a
given HRR when the ambient pressure was increased [233].

For a flame over a cylindrical solid fuel in quiescent low pressures,
the laminar flame length (Eq. (2.22)) is less sensitive to gravity levels but

the flame length increases in low pressure owing to the smaller gas
density. The dependence on pressure and gravity levels were validated
for the flame spread over an vertical electrical wires in low pressures
[94] and hypergravity [55]. The exponents of pressure and gravity are
quite close to the results observed in pool fires [233] and candle flames
[234]. Note that for a solid combustion, the pressure effect is also in-

tegrated into  ̇m
, as suggested in Eq. (2.19) of  ̇m
For materials like PMMA, the Spalding number Bw is typically treated as
a constant and less sensitive to pressure (Eq. (2.20)). Therefore, only the
pressure dependence of Nu in the pyrolysis zone should be considered.
Under a pure natural convection, Nu is typically a function of Gr
(cid:0)
) with m ≈ 1/4 for laminar flows and m ≈ 1/ 3 for
(Nu∝Grm∝
turbulent flows [61]. Thus, theoretically, the laminar flame length can
be reproduced by preserving P2m+n(cid:0) 1gm, whereas turbulent flame length
ʹ
can be reproduced by preserving P2g because  ̇m
and other terms in Eq.
(2.23) can be correlated with P2g. If DL is simplified to be inversely
proportional to the pressure (i.e., n = 1), the same P2g criterion can be
obtained for laminar and turbulent flame lengths. An exception to this is
that, Bw for a LDPE-insulated electrical wire varies with pressure
because the dripping of molten LDPE and the core heat conduction
modify the heat loss term (Eq. (2.21)) [94]. The increase in Bw in low
pressure accelerates the FSR (Fig. 25). Therefore, it should be noted that
in the normal gravity, the pressure effect is implicitly integrated into
mass transport for thermoplastic fuels with highly conductive matrices,
in addition to the considerations of hydrodynamics and heat transfer.

For sooty flames, the soot-related radiation leads to a more compli-
cated pressure dependence of flame length, because the soot production
rate is third-order in pressure [161]. Jalain et al. [163] observed that, in
a coflow laminar flame of ethylene in the normal gravity, the theoretical
increase in buoyancy due to higher ambient pressure is countered by
increasing radiative heat loss. (Fig. 27). This increased radiative heat
loss creates localized regions of low temperature and low buoyant flow
speed, which reduces the rate of oxygen entering the reaction zone
through both diffusion and entrainment. Consequently, the rates of soot
oxidation and fuel consumption slow down, resulting in longer flame
lengths than would occur in the absence of radiative heat loss. However,
in a microgravity, an opposite result could be observed because of the
absence of buoyancy and enlarged gas residence time. The significant
soot-related radiative heat loss can lead to a localized quenching at
flame tip hence shorten the microgravity flame length in high pressure,
as discussed in section 3.1.2.1.

4.1.2.2. Heat flux. Thomsen et al. [235] numerically investigated the
upward flame spread over thin cellulose in low-pressure and low-gravity
environments with a concurrent airflow of 20 cm/s. They reported that
this flame spread configuration is mainly controlled by convective heat
flux, which is determined by the flame standoff distance. Stagnation
layer theory [61] suggests that the flame standoff distance can be
approximated as yf ≈ δzBw/ln(1 +Bw) , where δz is the boundary layer
thickness without the mass transfer (i.e., blowing effect). Therefore, if
the pressure dependence of Bw could be ignored, yf theoretically de-
creases with the reduction in the gravity level and pressure due to hy-
drodynamic effects. This has been verified in Ref. [236] for the
measurements of yf over a thin PMMA sheet at various ambient pres-
sures in the normal gravity. For LDPE wires [94], Bw increases with
pressure, and the trend shows that yf also increases with increasing
pressure. However, the numerical results in Ref. [235] proposed another
possible reason: yf seems relatively insensitive to ambient pressure for
cellulose but follows the increasing trend with decreasing gravity level.

Nevertheless, the convective heat flux from the flame to the thin cellu-
lose surface in low pressure is similarly reduced due to the significant
reduction in the volumetric HRR of the flame. Although the heat flux
distributions are appreciably different between low pressure at 1g and
the standard pressure at microgravity, they lead to a similar reduction in
the FSR. While these numerical results need experimental verification,
they suggest another possible aspect where reduced buoyant flows (due
to gravity and pressure) may differ, indicating that caution should be
exercised when extrapolating results from one condition to another.

In low-pressure as well as low-gravity environments, the effect of
flame heat radiation becomes progressively more important due to the
rapid decrease in flame heat convection. However, there is a lack of fine
measurements of the flame heat flux, especially the radiative heat flux,
of a concurrent flame spread in a low-pressure environment. Guibaud
et al. [103–105] made detailed measurements of the temperature field,
soot volume fraction, and radiative heat flux of a spreading flame over a
wire in microgravity. Although the measurements were obtained in
opposed spread mode, the results are still informative for the study of
concurrent flame spread. They reported that the maximum incident
radiative flux could be as high as 17.5 kW/m2 which is reached at the
rear of the pyrolysis zone, but the convective heat flux is still dominant.

4.1.3. Low pressure limit

A flame extinction fundamentally arises from finite chemical reac-
tion rates. For an opposed flame spread, the ambient pressure influences
this process primarily in two ways. First, through fluid dynamics, such as
the increased gas-phase residence time at low pressure (Eq. (4.3)), which
reduces flame stretching but enhances radiative heat loss, leading to
quenching effect more significant in low pressures. Second, pressure
affects the reaction rate, which increases with pressure in combustible
mixtures. For instance, in a second-order Arrhenius reaction with a
Damk ̈ohler number expressed as:
)/

/

(cid:0)
Da = αgρgYO2Zg exp

(cid:0) E

RTf

b ∝(P/g)2/3
V2

(4.4)

where Da decreases significantly at low pressure, making near-limit
flames more susceptible to kinetics effects. Both the enhanced radia-
tive loss and kinetics effects destabilize the spreading flames in low
pressures. Fang et al. [237] further found that for flame spread over
horizontal thin papers, radiative heat loss dominates above 25 kPa, with
the FSR increasing exponentially with pressure. Below 25 kPa, the ki-
netics effect becomes more significant, disrupting the exponential
relationship.

Similar to the microgravity (Fig. 20a), the LOC decreases mono-
tonically with pressure (Fig. 28a). This trend is also observed in down-
ward flame spread over thin papers in quiescent low pressures [228,
238], with LOC appearing less sensitive to the paper thickness and width
in low pressure. However, for LDPE-insulated wires [140,231], it is
observed to be a function of pressure, though it remains unclear whether
this is due to the influence of molten droplets or significant solid-phase
heat conduction. Furthermore, the external radiation can mitigate the
heat loss. Liveretou et al. [239] reported that decreasing either the
ambient pressure or the external radiant flux increases the LOC of the
opposed flame over a black PMMA rod.

The LOC for concurrent-upward flame spread over thin papers in low
pressures increases with decreasing ambient pressure (Fig. 28b), and is
similar to that of opposed flame spread [232]. However, it is noted that
the blow-off effect becomes significant in the low-pressure limit of up-
ward flame spread. The flame length development in upward flame
the local buoyant flow speed in the flame
spread accelerates

stabilization zone. Compared to downward flame spread, this additional
buoyancy acceleration can widen the flammable range of the flame in
moderate pressure environments and lead to flame blowoff at lower
oxygen levels. Shih [240] numerically studied the gravity effects on the
low-pressure limit of upward flame spread over a thin material,
reporting a clear U-shaped trend: a quenching branch at low gravity and
a blowoff branch at higher gravity levels. He et al. [241] reported that
increasing the sample width reduces the three-dimensional heat-mass
losses, thereby broadening the flammability limits in low pressures. The
limiting oxygen partial pressure (LOPP) decreases with ambient pres-
sure, similar to the opposed flame spread in microgravity (Fig. 20b). In
addition, near the blowoff limit, Wang et al. [130] reported that char-
ring materials, such as thin paper, experience secondary pyrolysis and
surface oxidative degradation (smoldering), resulting in a periodic for-
mation of smolder “holes”. Such phenomenon has also been observed in
recent microgravity experiments [242], with the features of the “smol-
dering wave” being sensitive to forced flow speed and relative humidity.

4.2. Principles in simulating reduced buoyancy

4.2.1. Natural convection

As early as 1980, Law and coworkers [243,244] proposed
low-pressure environments (~0.1 atm) to reduce the buoyancy effect,
exhibiting a near concentric and spherical droplet flame, which could
simulate a droplet combustion in a low gravity. In combustion regions
where high temperatures are generated, there is a significant tempera-
ture and density gradients. In the presence of gravity, natural convection
occurs in this region. For the combustion system dominated by natural
convection, the governing equations (Eq. (2.11)(cid:0) 13) reveal that the
flow field depends primarily on the Grashof number (Gr ∼ ρ2g), which
characterizes the ratio of buoyancy to viscosity effects in the fluid. As
long as the Gr number remains constant, there is a similarity in the
velocity field for natural convection. Reducing the ambient pressure
decreases the system density (ρ ∼ P), resulting in a flow field similar to
that in low gravity. The modeling criterion is P2g, which is known as the
Grashof similarity law [14]. Table 1 summarizes the relationship

between ambient pressure and simulated gravity level. It is seen that,
under a natural convection, the gravitational fields of Moon (0.16 g) and
Mars (0.38 g) can be reproduced at around 40 and 62 kPa, respectively,
in a low-pressure environment at 1 g. However, to achieve high-quality
(cid:0) 4 g), a near-vacuum
microgravity conditions, such as space station (10
environment is required, where the influence of chemical reaction ki-
netics is significantly dominant.

Nakamura et al. [245] compared visible spreading flames over
LDPE-insulated NiCr wires at 101 kPa in microgravity and at 30 kPa in
quiescent normal gravity (Fig. 29a). The flame shapes are similar sug-
gesting comparable buoyancy effects. However, the flame color differs,
indicating variations in chemical processes. In the low pressure, reduced
collision frequency decreases the reaction rates and soot formation,
making the flame less luminous having blue color. In the microgravity at
101 kPa, the higher number of molecular collisions due to longer resi-
dence times lead to optimal conditions for soot growth, resulting in more
yellow luminous flames. Therefore, a more significant flame radiation is
expected in a microgravity.

Kleinhenz et al. [227] compared the upward flame spread over thin
cellulose fuels in quiescent low-pressure and partial gravity environ-
ments (Fig. 29b). They reported that the physical sizes of the flames,
both in terms of flame length and flame standoff distance, show
remarkable similarity when preserving P2g. However, there are slight
differences in the color of the flames. For example, the fuel-rich side of
the flames appears blue in the low-pressure environment at 1 g due to

the enhanced oxygen diffusion and slower soot production rate, while it
appears sooty in the partial gravity. These differences in flame color may
have caused variations in the flame heat flux and its components,
leading to deviations from the theoretical relationships (P2g). They
found that P1.8g seemed to better correlate with the observed FSR.

4.2.2. Mixed convection

A mixed convection condition refers to the simultaneous presence of
natural convection induced by flame buoyancy and forced convection
induced by external airflow (Fig. 30). In 1984, Mao et al. [246] inves-
tigated the similarity of the laminar flow field in various mixed con-
vections over a planar material
surface. They found that a
mixed-convection parameter (Ren + Grm)1/2n can scale the dependent
and independent variable fields, where for a vertical
surface
(m = 2, n = 4) and for a horizontal surface (m = 2, n = 5). Based on this
concept, Thomsen et al. [247] suggested that an equivalent mixed flow
speed (Vmix) can describe the mixed convection field. As long as this Vmix
is maintained constant, an equivalent flow field can be simulated when
other parameters are varied. This approach allows for the formulation of
the local boundary layer thickness as follows:

δf,x∝x(Ren + Grm)(cid:0) 1/2n Pr

(cid:0) 1/3 = x(ρ0Vmx/μ)(cid:0) 1/2 Pr

(cid:0) 1/3

(4.5)

where x is the flow developed length, ρ0 is the gas density at 101 kPa
(P0), and Vmix is given as:

(4.6)

For pure-natural convection, i.e., Vg→ 0, Vmix ≈ (P/P0)2m/nGrm/n/Re;
for pure-forced convection, Vmix ≈ Vg(P/P0). Note that above equation
assumes that both the forced convective boundary layer and the natural
convective boundary layer develop from the leading edge of the flame. If
there is an unheated length upstream of the flame leading edge, as often
occurs in opposed flame spread, the effective velocity imposed to flame
should be further considered accordingly [248,249].
In addition,
caution is needed when generalizing the flow boundary layer thickness
as equivalent to the flame standoff distance, as these two parameters
may differ significantly under varying convective boundary conditions
[250].

The FSR data with Eq. (4.6) has successfully correlated in the normal
gravity with varying oxygen concentrations, airflow speeds, and
ambient pressures for various materials, including thin composite fabric
(SIBAL) [109], fire-resistant fabric (Nomex HT90-40) [111], cellulosic
tissue [112], and thermally thick PMMA [110]. It was also extended to
partial- and micro-gravity data. In addition, similar approaches have
been applied to wire combustion with transverse flow [82,83,150,251],
offering the advantage of being easier to model compared to flow par-
allel to the sample. However, for an opposed flame spread over PMMA
rods, while this relationship effectively correlates the FSR under the
normal gravity conditions [226], deviations occur at very low flow
speeds (<1.5 cm/s) in microgravity [252]. Two possible explanations
are: 1) at very low flow speeds in microgravity, diffusion transport might

become more significant, thus the effective flow speed is the sum of the
forced flow speed and the diffusion speed; and 2) in microgravity, the
flow is primarily parallel to the rod surface, whereas in the normal
gravity, there is a perpendicular component driven by buoyant flow.

4.3. Limitations and challenges

4.3.1. Flow field

While the mixed convection simulation method based on the
boundary layer similarity (Section 4.2.2) provides a possible solution to
replicate the convective heat transfer at various flow speeds, pressures,
and gravity levels,
it remains unclear if flame structures remain
consistent at the same mixed flow speed. Flame next to a burning solid
material may not strictly follow a self-similar boundary layer prediction,
which requires a uniform surface temperature and a burning (blowing)
rate distribution consistent with the heat flux or flame standoff distance.
When the solid pyrolyzes according to the Arrhenius relation, the
burning rate is cutoff downstream rather abruptly. In some cases, flame
standoff in the preheating zone does not follow self-similar boundary
layer behavior [253,254]. At low flow speeds, flames are short and
strongly influenced by the stabilization zone structure, which is not
boundary-layer-like [255].

the

FSR,

same

convections

Simple correlations, unless backed by theory, may not extrapolate
beyond the available database due to the complex nature of flame-
spread problems and other unknown factors. Detailed numerical
modeling can serve as a useful supplement to experiments and theory,
particularly when experimental platforms are limited or costly. For
example, Hsu and T’ien [181] numerically calculated the flame struc-
tures and flow fields of concurrent flames under purely forced and
natural
the
(Fig. 31). Despite
forced-convection flame exhibits higher local flow speeds at the flame
leading edge and lower speeds at the flame tip. Such divergences of
isotherm contours and flow streamlines from the solid surface down-
stream in the forced convection increase the flame standoff distance,
thus reduce resultant convective heat flux, necessitating a longer py-
rolysis length to consume the solid fuel. In addition, due to the higher
flow speed at the flame tip, the flame is easier to blow off, causing more
fuel vapor to escape from the flame tip in the natural-convection flame.
Although the flame structures under mixed convections remain unex-
amined, it can be expected that the mixed convection acts as an inter-
mediate state between natural- and forced convections, thus this
condition likely presents multiple possibilities for the flame structure,
even at the same mixed flow speed. Extensive cases in Section 4.2.2
highlights the success of the mixed convection method in the function of
“FSR reproduction”, however, caution is warranted regarding specific
flame structures.

In addition, the air entrainment in the presence of buoyancy also
introduces a horizontal flow component, making narrow samples more
susceptible to blowoff under lower forced flow speed [129]. This raises
questions about the applicability of this simulation to narrow samples
[254].

4.3.2. Mechanism of fuel-air mixing

As described in Section 4.1.2.1, flames exhibit different gas mixing
mechanisms in laminar and turbulent states: laminar flow relies pri-
marily on molecular diffusion, while turbulent flow depends on
entrainment. Consequently, the flame length expression shows different
pressure-gravity correlations: at a given burning rate, the convection-
controlled laminar flame length exhibits a weak correlation with pres-
sure alone, whereas turbulent flame length is proportional to P2g [94]. A
flame length is crucial in determining the concurrent FSR. Therefore,
while the early-stage concurrent flame spread behavior in low gravity
can be effectively simulated in a designed low-pressure environment,
accurately reproducing the fully-developed turbulent flame character-
istics in the same pressure may not be feasible. Due to the limited test
scale in low-gravity facilities, current flame spread research primarily

focuses on laminar flames, leaving turbulent flames largely unexplored.
As a result, the entrainment effect, while not yet demonstrated experi-
mentally, merits further investigation.

4.3.3. Finite rate chemistry

Bhattacharjee and Carmignani [45] numerically examined the
radiation-kinetics interactions in a downward flame spread over a thin
solid fuel in low pressure and low gravity. Three non-dimensional pa-
rameters were examined: the Damk ̈ohler number (Da, evaluated by Eq.
(2.12) with ambient oxygen level and adiabatic flame temperature),
which quantifies the effect of finite-rate kinetics; the radiation number
(Rrad,g, Eq. (2.10)), which assesses the gas-phase radiation; and the
radiation-kinetics number (RK = Rrad,g/Da), which compares the rela-
tive importance of gas-phase radiation and kinetics. Various effects of
pressure and gravity are illustrated in Fig. 32: Rrad,g increases with the
reductions in both pressure and gravity levels, causing radiation to play
a significant role. However, the Da number decreases with lower pres-
sure but higher gravity level. This indicates that flame extinction in low
pressure is influenced by both gas-phase radiation and kinetics effects,
while in low gravity, it is primarily controlled by radiative heat loss.
Although RK increases significantly in low pressure, which means the
gas-phase radiation becomes more crucial than finite-rate kinetics near
low-pressure limit, the additional kinetic effects involved in reproducing
near-limit flame spread in low gravity by reducing ambient pressure are
inevitable. These effects have not yet been systematically investigated
and require further investigation.

4.3.4. Gravity response of condensed phase

Using low pressure to simulate low-gravity flame spread behavior
fundamentally relies on replicating the gas-phase flow response to
buoyancy. However, this approach cannot effectively replicate the
response of the condensed phase to gravity [55,56]. For instance, ther-
moplastic materials, such as LDPE-coated wires, which exhibit melt-drip
properties, would not drip in low gravity. In contrast, in a low-pressure
environment at 1 g, dripping may alter the local thickness and fuel load
of the material [53], remove a significant amount of enthalpy from the
burning material [53,256,257], or enhance heat-mass transfer through
the dripping flow [54–56,160], all of which can change the flame spread
behaviors. Dripping can have a significant or even dominant impact on
material pyrolysis or flame spread, which cannot be replicated by
altering pressure alone [140]. Simple scaling analyses are insufficient to
reproduce the gravity effects on flame spread over a thermoplastic
material, and future pressure models must consider additional
parameters.

5. Flame spread in a narrow channel apparatus

5.1. Background and principles in simulating reduced buoyancy

The narrow channel apparatus (NCA), utilizing a quasi-two-
dimensional Hele-Shaw geometry, serves as an economical ground-
based method in simulating micro- and partial-gravities. Unlike cost-
lier facilities such as drop towers and parabolic flights, the NCA offers
crucial advantages of low cost and unrestricted testing time. This
apparatus was initially proposed by Melikhov et al. [258], further
updated by Zik and coworkers [259–261] to investigate flame instability
in constrained spaces, such as near-limit flames within curtain gaps,
electronic equipment, or densely packed combustible materials. These
near-limit flames can persist for extended durations but often remain
below the detection threshold of conventional fire sensors.

Typical NCAs for solid combustion research consist of three sections
(Fig. 33). The inlet section provides a controlled oxidizing flow. To
maintain a laminar Hagen-Poiseuille flow, the test section of NCA fea-
tures a large width-to-height aspect ratio (approximately 100:1) and an
entry length at the sample leading edge of 46–405 mm [262]. The outlet

(5.1)

Typically, Pr is reasonably a constant and does not vary with tem-
perature and pressure. Theoretically, when Gr ≤ 2429 or Ra ≤ 1700,
natural convection can be ignored. Experimentally, a narrow channel
with H ≤ 10 mm, i.e., Ra ≤ 1810, can well reproduce the unique
fingering pattern observed in microgravity [260,264]. If H is larger than
10 mm but still smaller than the flame height in open space [265],
natural convection begins to develop, exhibiting features similar to
partial gravity [32].

In the NCA, a smooth and uniform flame front develops to corrugate
and even split recurrently with local extinction. The flame tracks take on
a “finger-like” flamelet appearance, as displayed in Fig. 34. This
fingering mode occurs due to significant heat losses to nearby walls, or a
substantial reduction in oxygen supply caused by the weakened natural
convection. Zik et al. [259–261] proposed that the single finger width
(w) and the spacing between fingers (d) can be characterized by the
P ́eclet number:

Pe = VgH

/

DO2

(5.2)

where DO2 is the oxygen molecular diffusivity (typically 0.25 cm2/s). As
shown in Fig. 34a, d increases with a decrease in Pe by adjusting Vg, but
w remains almost constant, despite the fingertip growing slightly in
width as it moves forward until splitting. Additionally, increasing the
oxygen level does not influence w to increase, but could result in more
frequent splits and local extinction of the fingertip [266]. The substan-
tial increase in w is caused by the increase in H as illustrated in Fig. 34b.
Setting a large H (>1 cm) can prevent fingering instability due to the
residual vertical buoyant convection, while setting a small H (<0.2 cm)
reduces both the uniformity of airflow and the heat exchange with the
top plate. Moreover, w decreases when non-reactive gas is added or the
thermal conductivity of the bottom plate increases, as it inversely cor-
relates with the HRR. This fingering mode also arises when the sample’s
half-width exceeds the oxygen diffusion length LO2. A sample with a
wider width Ws of 5 cm (Ws > 2 LO2) at Vg = 1 cm/s begins to exhibit a
fingering pattern, whereas the flame front for the narrower samples (Ws
< 2 LO2) is more uniform due to more lateral oxygen diffusion. This
effect can be suppressed by a higher Vg but the side heat loss can cause
the leading edges of wider flames to form parabolic shapes. The curva-
ture of the leading edge increases with the sample width but decreases
with higher Vg or oxygen concentration [267].

Another theory proposes that the fingering is related to diffusive-
thermal instability in partially premixed flames, and in some cases the
fingering was also achieved without forced airflow when the surface
temperature of the bottom plate was increased. Therefore, the fingering

section expels the exhaust gases. Experimental setups vary in the design
of the test section. In the case of thermally-thin materials, the sample is
symmetrically installed and suspended at the center of the channel
(Fig. 33a). The vertical channel height H = 2h + τ between the channel
top and bottom is usually adjustable, where h is the distance from the
sample surface to the channel top or bottom, and τ is the sample
thickness. A thin sample can also be mounted on the channel bottom and
in such a case H ≈ h (Fig. 33b). For thermally-thick materials, the
sample and the insulation board are embedded in the recessed section of
the sample holder (Fig. 33c).

The suppression of gravity-induced buoyant convection is achieved
by confining the vertical cellular flow between the top and bottom
plates, which is governed by the Grashof number (Gr) or Rayleigh
number (Ra). For a given fluid, Ra is the product of Gr and the Prandtl
number (Pr):

pattern can only emerge as the system’s Lewis number is smaller than
unity [268–270]. Kuwana et al. [266] introduced an effective Lewis

flamelets can also emerge in a vertical narrow channel, which has inner

oxygen. It indicates that the oxygen-limited atmosphere is not the only
factor triggering flamelet. They proposed that the transition from uni-

5.2. Flame spread in simulated microgravity conditions

5.2.1. Opposed flame spread

5.2.1.1. Thermally thin material. Olson and coworkers [179,273]
compared opposed flame spread over thin samples (filter papers and
PMMA sheets) in an NCA (H = 5 mm) at 1 g, and under microgravity in a
drop tower with the duration of 5.8 s (Fig. 35). In microgravity condi-
tion, the initial 2D flame had a transition to a dimmer tiny flame with a
corrugated leading front, ultimately breaking into multiple individual
flamelets. These flamelets emerged when the opposed flow speed
decreased to the same magnitude of the speed for thermal expansion,
molecular diffusion, residual buoyancy, and fuel vapor blowing from the
sample (1–1.5 cm/s). The flamelet spreading remained steady during the
microgravity duration. The fingering pattern over the thin filter paper in
the NCA showed good agreement with those observed in microgravity.
The burned fraction (the ratio of total flame width to sample width) of
filter paper decreased when the flame broke into flamelets, having the
ratio around 60 % for both the NCA and the microgravity tests. The
flame surface-to-volume ratio increased threefold, concentrating heat
release into a smaller volume and enhancing the oxygen supply. As
shown in Fig. 35d, the FSR decreases when uniform flames have a
transition to flamelets, demonstrating the NCA data at 1 g closely

matching with the microgravity observations. A plateau region in terms
of Vg exists in the FSR before extinction due to the critical heat flux
needed to ignite the preheating zone. Near the limit, the flame shrinks
and extends rather than spreading more slowly to offset the limited
oxygen supply. In real fire scenarios, these flamelets can propagate,
igniting surrounding materials and potentially developing into large
fires under favorable conditions. Therefore, when responding to a fire,
astronauts are advised to shut down the ventilation system to cut off the
oxygen supply and minimize smoke diffusion.

In contrast to the thin filter paper, the microgravity flame over a 0.6-
mm-thick PMMA (Fig. 35c) forms two oscillating flamelets in the
spanwise direction. These oscillations are due to the PMMA’s slower
flame shrinkage rate, which keeps the solid phase hot and release py-
rolysis gases to form a premixed layer. Bomand et al. [274] compared
the FSR over a thin PMMA in an NCA with microgravity data across
various flow speeds and ambient oxygen concentrations, and found that
the two overlap well, and the typical trend shown in Fig. 14a can be
reproduced. The bifurcation and extinction behaviors of flamelets can be
described using a continuous logistic model with a time lag, similar to
the characteristics in plant and animal populations [273]. Additionally,
Wichman et al. [275] observed that reducing the channel height led to a
flame-to-flamelet transition, with the number of flamelets increasing as
the channel height decreased. However, this increase had a limit, and
flamelets extinguished rapidly when the channel height became suffi-
ciently small.

5.2.1.2. Thermally thick material. Zhu et al. [189] compared the
opposed flame spread over a 10-mm-thick PMMA slab onboard the SJ-10
satellite (microgravity) and in an NCA at 1g (Fig. 36). For
thermally-thick materials, the opposed flame spread is more sensitive to
the local flow speed at flame front (Eq. (2.13b)), due to the dependence
of the solid-phase thermal length on the residence time. In the NCA, the
presence of residual buoyant flow speed causes the flame-to-flamelet
transition to occur at a smaller opposed flow speed and oxygen level,

HCA [265].

Y. Ma et al.

and higher FSR, compared to the microgravity conditions. For an NCA
with H of 10 mm, the estimated residual buoyant flow speed ranges from
1 to 5 cm/s at lower opposed flow speeds, but is negligible at higher flow
speeds [179,189].

Furthermore, Wichman and coworkers [262,276] observed a
“regressive burning regime” for thermally-thick materials at high flow
speeds. In this regime, the opposed flame maintains a near constant FSR
before blowoff, and continuously consumes the fuel in the pyrolysis
zone. It is caused by the triple flame structure of flame front. When the
opposed flow speed increases, the boundary layer becomes thinner,
thereby the flame speed of the triple flame decreases, then the flame
front retreats to a position within the velocity boundary layer where the
opposed flow speed is lower [39].

5.2.2. Concurrent flame spread

Compared to an opposed flamelet mode, a concurrent flamelet mode
consumes more solid fuel during spread [273]. Zik and Moses [261]
observed that the concurrent fingering pattern is a transient, as the
isolated flamelets eventually merge again. In an opposed flow, the
second-generation flamelet at the bifurcation points typically divides
into two branches, whereas in a concurrent flow, period-doubling leads
to multiple branches forming a tree-like structure to maximize oxygen
intake. Wang et al. [277] reported that both the flamelet width and the
FSR over a thin filter paper increase monotonically with concurrent flow
in an NCA with H = 11 mm. The concurrent flamelet front becomes more
fragmented and irregular at higher flow speeds (Fig. 37a) due to the
increases, the
dominant effect of hydrodynamic. As oxygen level
flamelet undergoes transverse creeping motion and forms a relatively
smooth edge (Fig. 37b), possibly indicating post-development of the
flame front beyond the onset of traveling wave instability.

For a thick PMMA, Zhu et al. [263] reported that the concurrent FSR
in an NCA with H = 10 mm is smaller than the opposed FSR in a rela-
tively low flow region, consistent with the microgravity results indicated
in Fig. 13a. As the channel height (H), concurrent flow speed, and ox-
ygen level decrease, excessive pyrolyzed fuel accumulates at the flame
leading edge, making the system fuel-rich. As a result, concurrent flame
spread over a thick PMMA shifts to a “fuel regression mode” [278],
where the downstream flame tilts or stands upright toward the up-
stream, contracting into a single flamelet rather than breaking into
multiple flamelets (Fig. 37c). This mode is characterized by a fuel
regression angle of over 30
and a global flame equivalence ratio above
1.9. Further reducing the oxygen supply leads to only a thin layer of the

◦

solid fuel being consumed (“partial regression”).

5.2.3. Flammability boundary

The flammability maps for thin filter paper and thick PMMA in
opposed and concurrent flow in an NCA and under microgravity [179,
189,277,278] are shown in Fig. 38. In the opposed flow, the flamelet
mode rapidly increases the specific surface area of flame after the
fragmentation of a uniform flame front, thereby extending the extinction
limit to lower oxygen levels. For the thin filter paper, the flamelet region
narrows as the opposed flow increases. In contrast, for the thick PMMA,
the flamelet region is widest at around 5 cm/s but narrows with either
increasing or decreasing opposed flow speed. Due to a residual buoyancy
in NCA, flamelets begin to appear at lower oxygen levels. The extinction
boundary in microgravity, i.e., LOC, can be well reproduced in the NCA
for thin filter paper. However, for thick PMMA, the LOC is lower in the
NCA due to the variable thermal length in the solid phase, which makes
it sensitive to slight changes in ambient conditions. In a concurrent flow,
the flamelet region for thin filter paper can be further divided into two
sub-regimes: the traveling wave instability (TWI) regime at higher ox-
ygen levels, and the fingering or cellular instability (FCI) regime at lower
oxygen levels. For the thick PMMA, the fuel-regression region also ex-
tends the LOC in low-speed concurrent flow. It is noted that, compared
to opposed spread, concurrent spread(cid:0) whether in flamelet mode or
fuel-regression mode(cid:0) exists in a narrow range of oxygen levels, which
indicates the uniform flame front is more stable in concurrent flow.
Furthermore, Zhu et al. [263] compared the LOC of thick PMMA in
opposed and concurrent flow in an NCA, finding that LOC in the con-
current flow is lower than that in the opposed flow, even near the
quiescent condition. This contrasts with numerical results for thin
samples in microgravity, that the LOC near quiescent condition is lower
in opposed flow than in concurrent flow, due to oxygen shadow effect
[193] (Fig. 19b). However, the lack of microgravity data makes it un-
clear whether this discrepancy arises from residual buoyancy effects in
an NCA or inherent characteristics of thick materials.

5.2.4. Effect of atmospheric pressure

For opposed flame spread, decreasing ambient pressure increases the
gas-phase thermal length and flame standoff distance. These changes in
characteristic flame length scales significantly alter the heat transfer
between flame and walls of NCA. Pepper et al. [279] compared the
opposed FSR over a thin filter paper in an NCA with H = 10 mm and in
microgravity, with various ambient pressures. They reported that the

Fig. 40. (a) 3-D flow streamlines with enclosure and without enclosure [289]; (b) overall equivalence ratio versus dimensionless opposed flow speed [288]; (c)
dimensionless heat loss versus dimensionless opposed flow speed under various channel heights [288].

Y. Ma et al.

NCA FSR matches well with the microgravity FSR at 1 atm, while the
microgravity FSR shows less sensitivity to pressure changes. In contrast,
the NCA FSR decreases as pressure decreases, possibly due to the
increased heat loss through the NCA walls. Although an 10 mm channel
height (H) provides an optimum balance between reducing buoyancy
and minimizing heat loss for a thin fuel at 1 atm [264], determining the
optimal heights in low pressure requires further adjustment. Further-
more, Zhu et al. [280] reported that in an opposed flow, the uniform
flame over thick PMMA could break into flamelets at higher oxygen
levels in low pressure. The reduction in pressure significantly expands
the flamelet region between the uniform flame boundary and the
extinction boundary, albeit with only a slight increase in the LOC. Thus,
the destabilize-break behavior of the uniform flame is more sensitive to
pressure change than the total flame extinction.

5.2.5. Effect of fire suppressants

Incorporating a gaseous fire suppressant such as trifluoroiodo-
methane (CF3I) into the gas stream in an NCA allows for the evaluation
of the efficacy of these agents against solid burning under controlled
[281–283]. Furthermore, collecting gaseous products
conditions
downstream facilitates testing for toxicity and combustion by-products.
As expected, the FSR decreases with increasing concentrations of the
added agent, primarily due to the removal of radicals such as H* and
OH*. For example, CF3I disrupts exothermic chain reactions in the flame
zone through iodine-catalyzed cycling or by fixing H* radicals into
hydrogen fluoride, thereby slowing the burning rate and increasing soot
and condensed tar production. However, O* radicals persist in the
flames or regenerate in subsequent reactions, resulting in minimal
variation in flame length with suppressant concentration.

5.3. Flame spread in simulated partial-gravity conditions

in the horizontal channel apparatus

The buoyancy effect increases with the height (H) of NCA. Thus, a
channel with insufficiently narrow height may reproduce partial-gravity
flame spread. Wu et al. [265] proposed using an extended channel
height
to simulate
partial-gravity flame spread. They suggested maintaining a constant
Rayleigh number
to reproduce opposed flame spread in
partial-gravity. In the HCA, calculations use H as the characteristic
length, while for partial-gravity flame spread, it should be replaced by a
modified gas-phase thermal length:

Comparisons of the FSR and LOC data in terms of the Ra number over
a thin paper are shown in Fig. 39, obtained in the HCA [265] and partial
gravity [32]. The LOC in HCA shows a strong correlation with that in the
partial gravity. However, the FSRs in HCA diverge from those in
partial-gravity when the Ra number is of the order of 103 to 104. This
divergence arises from the formation of “rolling flame” structures (as
shown in the embedded image in Fig. 39a), which resemble transverse
vortex rolls in Rayleigh-B ́enard-Poiseuille (RBP) flow within this region
and causes a special concurrent spread. This highlights ongoing chal-
lenges in current HCA devices to accurately simulate partial-gravity
flame propagation away from the extinction limit, where larger flame
scales typically occur. In addition, four unstable flame spread patterns,
as shown in Fig. 39c, are observed during transitions from flamelet to
uniform flame as the Ra number and the Reynolds number (Re = VgH/υ)
of the HCA change. Due to the lack of partial gravity data, it remains
unclear whether this mode shift also exists in partial-gravity.

5.4. Limitations: enclosure effect

An NCA introduces a significant enclosure effect on flame spread
behavior due to its constrained geometry. Experimental and numerical
results in the literature clearly illustrate how the changes in NCA di-
mensions alter thermal expansion and heat-mass transfer processes,
impacting flame spread and extinction limits [35,254,267,284–288].
Fundamentally, the enclosure effect can be understood from three as-
pects: flow field, global stoichiometry, and heat loss. These effects also
present challenges in using an NCA to simulate low-gravity flame spread
behaviors.

5.4.1. Flow field

One of the most critical parameters in the flame spread is the effec-
tive flow rate encountered by the flame front within the boundary layer.
Although the applied free-stream flow speeds might be the same, the
velocity distribution in the narrow channel(cid:0) characterized by the
Hagen-Poiseuille parabolic profile(cid:0) differs from the cubic polynomial
velocity profile described by the Pohlhausen method for an open space
boundary layer over a material surface. Consequently, additional cal-
culations of the velocity field are necessary to accurately compare the
simulated flame spread in an NCA and in low-gravity environment. For
example, Hossain et al. [262] calculated the stretch rate at the flame
front, incorporating both forced and buoyant stretches, and successfully
correlated the opposed flame spread behaviors across various NCA
configurations. However, for more complex configurations, the associ-
ated calculations may become a challenge.

Furthermore, according to numerical simulations by Nakamura et al.
[289] (Fig. 40a), the gas expansion effect is confined in the enclosure,
thus the streamlines become denser near the enclosure walls, resulting
in a larger flame size. Simultaneously, the oxygen transport process
changes; for the enclosed case, the streamlines behind the flame bend
closer to the flame, supplying additional oxygen. This enhances com-
bustion, increases the heat flux from the flame to the solid, and increases
the total HRR. Consequently, the FSR for enclosed cases is higher than
that for open cases when the imposed flow speed or oxygen level is low.
It is expected that, in three-dimensional cases (narrower samples), the
enclosure effect is more pronounced than in two-dimensional cases
(wider samples) due to multi-dimensional enhanced oxygen transport to
the flame.

In addition, the interaction between residual buoyancy and the
narrow channel is also an issue of concern. For example, in the simu-
lation of a low-gravity environment using an HCA, the ceiling jet
generated by residual buoyancy impacting the channel ceiling, signifi-
cantly alters the flame geometry, by forming a distinctive “rolling flame”

structure (Fig. 39a).

5.4.2. Global stoichiometry

When the fuel pyrolysis rate is smaller than the stoichiometric
requirement of oxygen delivered by the inflow, the NCA flame exhibits a
boundary flame configuration similar to that in an open space (Fig. 40b).
However, if the inflow is oxygen-limited, the flame will deflect toward
the wall away from the sample surface to seek more oxygen. When the
fuel pyrolysis rate exceeds the stoichiometric requirement of the inflow
oxygen, the flame moves closer on the apparatus wall. The combustion
system becomes overall fuel-rich, consuming all the oxygen from up-
stream [288], creating an oxygen shadow on the downstream with
excess fuel gases. Note that this oxygen shadow effect in an NCA results
from the restriction of the channel walls, whereas in microgravity, it is
caused by the inherently low diffusion rate of oxygen. Consequently, the
flame geometry in an NCA and the resultant thermal feedback to the
material are expected to exhibit significant differences compared to that
in a microgravity, regardless of whether the flame spread is opposed or
concurrent [264,278,288]. Hossain et al. [288] defined a global equiv-
alence ratio Ψ of a flame spread system in an NCA:

Ψ = ψ

)

(5.6)

where the fuel-to-air feed ratio is normalized by its stoichiometric value
(1/ ψ). As shown in Fig. 40b, increasing the inflow rate (Vg) or the
channel height (H) can decrease Ψ , transforming the system from fuel-
rich to fuel-lean. When the inflow speed becomes comparable to the
̂
V g = C×
oxygen diffusion speed, i.e., when the non-dimensional speed
Le × Pe1/2 approaches unity, Ψ also approaches unity. For high-speed
convection conditions, the buoyancy effect is eliminated due to the
reduced buoyancy development length (flame height), rendering the
size of narrow channel insignificant. Conversely, under low-speed con-
vection conditions, to minimize the oxygen-limited effect caused by the
narrow channel restriction, an NCA should be enlarged as much as
possible. However, this approach contradicts the original purpose of
using an NCA to simulate low gravity.

5.4.3. Wall heat loss

The important role of flame heat losses to the NAC wall was elabo-
rated in Refs. [264,266,288], and the forced convection heat losses were
found to be more sensitive to the channel height (H) than buoyant
convective heat losses. Hossain et al. [288] plotted the dimensionless
heat loss (the ratio of heat losses to HRR) as a function of dimensionless
opposed flow speed (the ratio of opposed flow speed to oxygen diffusion

̂
V g) in an NCA, as shown in Fig. 40c, and compared it with the
speed,
microgravity data (RITSI) [145]. The dimensionless heat loss generally

increases as H decreases and reaches a minimum value at a moderate
Therefore, heat loss effects are non-negligible at both low and high flow
speeds. Additionally, even though H = 7 mm is considered “high”, its
overall heat loss is still far greater than that in microgravity. This
inherent higher heat loss in an NCA results in that flame may extinguish
at a larger flow speed [274], compared to microgravity flames [42]. An
NCA could be a feasible alternative method for screening material
flammability, but the challenge lies in finding the optimum channel
height (H) for simulating microgravity, to achieve a proper balance
between wall heat loss and residual buoyancy.

6. Stagnation-point low-stretch diffusion flame

The above discussions focus on combustion in several zones by the
existence of flame leading edge, complicating the description of flame
spreading and potentially this may distract the question of extinction
limit or flammability. To simplify this issue, one can consider a diffusion
flame configuration where only one zone exists: the stagnation-point
flame, as demonstrated in Fig. 41 [290]. In this flame geometry, all
scalar quantities, such as temperature and species concentrations, are
quasi-one-dimensional, and the solid burning rate becomes uniform.
Generally, the entire flame is in the stabilization zone. Mathematically,
for such stagnation-point flames, the governing system consists of or-
dinary differential equations, whereas spreading flames are governed by
partial differential equations. Therefore, the stagnation-point flame
configuration can simplify the problem of steady combustion and
extinction and facilitate the measurement of flame morphology. This
configuration can therefore be employed in the studies of burning and
extinction behaviors of materials.

In a spacecraft microgravity environment, although buoyancy-
induced convection is diminished, there is also a low-speed forced-
convection flow due to HVAC or crew movement. If a fire occurs in a
microgravity, this low-speed forced convection flow will induce a low
stretch flame. On the earth, the buoyancy effect typically precludes
studying the effect of low stretch rate flames. It was previously thought
that a vanishing stretch rate corresponds to an infinitely large Dam-
k ̈ohler number (Da), where residence time is much longer than chemical
reaction time, and this is typically associated with a robust flame [291].
However, this is not the case for a microgravity low stretch flame when
considering radiative heat loss. With radiative heat loss, a flame can be
quenched at a small stretch rate. Therefore, the following sections focus
on the low-stretch diffusion flames in the stagnation-point region, with

Therefore, a is an equivalent stretch rate, which can characterize

6.1.2. Validity of reduced-gravity simulation at low stretch rates

The flammability map and burning characteristics of low-stretch
flames in microgravity with forced convection, and in normal gravity
with buoyant or mixed convection, have been theoretically predicted to
be practically the same [292]. For example,
the dimensional
fuel-burning rate and dimensional maximum temperature, and the
extinction boundary of critical oxygen mass fraction versus stretch rate,
are shown in Fig. 42. These results indicate that understanding a ma-
terial’s burning characteristics and flammability map in the low-stretch
environment of spacecraft (non-buoyant, but with low-speed forced
convection) can be achieved by studying these characteristics in an
equivalent ground-based stretch environment (induced by normal
gravity buoyancy or mixed convection).

6.1.3. Ground-based setups for low stretch flames

Several experimental setups were established to obtain stagnation-
point low stretch flames at 1 g. Equivalent stretch rates can be deter-
mined as a function of gravity, imposed flow, and geometry.

One method involves increasing the radius of fuel sample (r), as
illustrated in Fig. 43a. In this setup, the oxygen level around the fuel can
be adjusted through a honeycomb. The forced flow speed from the
honeycomb can be very small compared to the buoyancy-induced flow
speed, thus the flow around the sample is still dominated by buoyancy.
The equivalent stretch rate in this case is the buoyant stretch rate (Eq.
(6.9)). Another method to achieve a low stretch flame involves reducing
the gas density difference around the flame using a heated inverted-cone
geometry, with the sample burning on a ceiling (Fig. 43b). The cone is
inverted to heat the sample from below, creating a ceiling flow and fire
configuration. In this setup, the air around the flame is also heated,
preventing the hot buoyancy flow from rising and thereby effectively
reducing the buoyancy effect. In this configuration, the low-speed flow
is primarily controlled by forced convection. The equivalent stretch rate
is characterized by af = 2U∞/r [292] for a cylinder, or af = Ujet/ djet
[293] for a jet impinging on a planar surface.

The above setups are designed for the combustion of solid fuel, but
the solid-phase pyrolysis can significantly impact the gas-phase flame.
Therefore, gas-phase flame characteristics cannot be studied indepen-
dently from solid burning. Several studies have used a spherical porous
burner with a large radius of curvature to supply fuel to establish low

stretch diffusion flames [296,299–301], as schematically illustrated in
Fig. 43c. This burner is similar in design to the “Tsuji” burner. The
burner is equipped with an independent fuel control system, enabling
precise control of flame position. By adjusting the flame standoff dis-
tance, heat losses to the burner can be minimized. Furthermore, the
absence of solid fuel eliminates uncertainties related to pyrolysis, thus
the burner ensures a steady and sustained fuel supply.

In addition, compared to solid fuels, the gaseous burner allows for
the variations in the Lewis number of the fuel or oxidizer, thus altering
the preferential diffusion of fuel components. This function is important
because the thermal-diffusive instability may lead to flame extinction.
The gaseous configuration provides a versatile platform to study these
instabilities and offers insights that could be applied to better under-
stand combustion mechanisms in various solid materials.

6.2. Quasi-steady low-stretch diffusion flames

Under 21 % vol. O2 and 1 atm, a flammable stretch rate spans a wide
(cid:0) 1, as predicted theoretically
range from approximately 1.5 to about 90 s
[125,292]. This range allows the establishment of quasi-steady flames
(cid:0) 1
across different stretch rates. The stretch rate in the range of 2–12 s
are comparable to those induced by a HVAC in a spacecraft under
microgravity [302], which has been extensively studied. Experimental
results demonstrated the transition from a robust flame at stretch rate of
(cid:0) 1 in air,
(cid:0) 1 to a quenched flame at ultra-low stretch rate of 1–2 s
10–20 s

where a is predominantly buoyancy-controlled [291,295].

6.2.1. Solid-phase surface regression

Thick molten layers that generate abundant in-depth fuel vapor may
significantly influence the flame flammability in microgravity [302].
Given that the burning at a low stretch rate in normal gravity exhibits
comparable behaviors to those observed in microgravity, studies on
equivalent low stretch flames in the normal gravity have been conducted
[291,303]. As shown in Fig. 44a [302], vapor bubbles migrate deeper
into the PMMA sample, away from the hot burning surface under the
effect of buoyancy, while both thermocapillary force and surface
regression causes the bubbles to move toward the hot burning surface,
forming a bubble layer. As the initial bubbles accumulate, molten PMMA
droplets form, as shown in Fig. 44b. As bubbles reach the burning sur-
face, bursting of these bubbles can expel the molten PMMA droplets and
monomer MMA vapors by jetting from the surface. However, continual
accumulation of bubbles does not occur; instead, a stabilized surface
regression accompanies a steady regression period, allowing for deter-
mination of the steady regression rate, Vreg. The experimental Vreg for
PMMA decreases as the stretch rate decreases (Fig. 45a) [291], sug-
gesting that lower stretch rates reduce solid-phase pyrolysis and slow
down the gas-phase reaction rate. This Vreg was proportional to stretch
(cid:0) 1).
rate, excluding the quenching (~3 s
During solid-phase regression, bubble formation and growth are
influenced by buoyancy. Understanding how buoyancy affects bubble
motion, potentially leading to variations in bubble behavior between the
normal gravity low stretch flames and low gravity environments, is of
particular interest. Olson and T’ien [302] obsvered that bubbles tend to
move perpendicular to the surface rather than along the gravitational
vector. This suggests that thermocapillary convection drives bubbles
toward the hotter surface, following the temperature gradient within the
viscous molten material. The opposing motions of buoyancy-driven flow
and thermocapillary convection highlight their nearly balanced effects.
A ratio of buoyant motion to thermocapillary motion, namely Bond
number, was proposed to determine the dominant effect [304]:

(6.10)

where ρl is the molten liquid density, ˇr is the bubble radius, and σ is the
surface tension. Buoyancy and thermocapillary forces balance near Bo ≈
7(cid:0) 8. Note that Bo for the bubbles are all less than 4 for the testing
samples in Ref. [302], so thermocapillary forces are the dominant
driving force for any bubble motions. Therefore, the bubble layer motion
would also be found in microgravity.

This bubble layer can influence heat transfer processes, such as heat
conduction and the absorption/scattering of external radiation. Typi-
cally, a solid-phase P ́eclet number (Pe), defined as the ratio of convec-
tion (surface regression) to conduction Pe = LVregr/αs [302], can be used
to estimate the solid-phase non-dimensional temperature Θ(̃
L):

Ts (cid:0) T∞

= exp

(cid:0) Pe

(cid:0) Pe ̃L (cid:0) exp
1 (cid:0) exp(cid:0) Pe

(6.11)

where ̃L = y/L represents the non-dimensional depth from the burning
surface normalized by the initial thickness of the sample. At a large Pe
(indicating fast regression rates), the temperature profile exhibits steep
gradients near the regression surface, while gradients at the back surface
of the sample are much shallower. During solid burning, most heat is
transferred back into the flame, minimizing heat flux loss into the depth.
Conversely, at a small Pe (indicating slow regression rates), only a small
portion of the heat flux is recovered to support the flame. As Pe ap-
proaches zero, the proportion of heat loss from the back surface relative
to the heat penetrating from the burning surface increases significantly,
nearing a 1:1 ratio [302]. This indicates that the bubble layer acts as
insulation for the polymer surface. For PMMAs, the measured Pe ranged
from 3.6 to 0.15, where lower stretch rates corresponded to smaller Pe
[302]. Lower Pe values result in a thicker glassy portion of the sample,
leading to a thicker bubble layer. Therefore, lower stretch rates appear
capable of sustaining longer flames, thereby increasing the fire risk in
microgravity.

6.2.2. Burning rate

The burning rate in a strict sense is defined as the mass rate of fuel
consumed by the chemical reaction. For the flaming combustion of
solids and liquids, the term is loosely used to refer to the mass loss rate of
the condensed-phase fuels. Since different low stretch rates can repre-
sent various low gravity levels [305], solving for the burning rate at
varied low stretch flames is of practical value for understanding fires in
micro- and partial gravities.

Based on previous research on mass and energy conversation, a
fw, is evaluated using

(6.12)

A quasi-steady burning rate of (cid:0) fw for cylindrical PMMA was found
to decrease nonlinearly with decreasing stretch rate in the low stretch
regime (Fig. 45b), indicating that a uniform flame cannot be sustained
(cid:0) 1. In this very low stretch rate
when the stretch rate is less than 3 s
region, a flamelet
instability was observed before reaching the
quenching limit, which will be discussed in detail in the next section.
The decreasing burning rate at low stretch rates suggests that combus-
tion is slower and the flame is weaker. Further decreases in the stretch
rate will lead to a similar phenomenon to flame extinction in micro-
gravity. Rhatigan et al. [59] considered both solid surface radiation and
gas-phase radiation when numerically solving the burning characteris-
tics. They found that (cid:0) fw are very similar for cases with and without
gas-phase radiation far from extinction limit, but show a significant
difference when any radiative losses are ignored. Gas radiative effects
are more pronounced at low stretch rates hence narrows the flammable
domain. Bedir et al. [139] using a narrow-band radiation model clarified
the flame optical thickness issue at low stretch (neither thick nor thin).
Radiation absorption is spectral, and CO2 self-absorption is the most
pronounced one. To avoid tedious computation using band model, an
engineering approach was suggested in Ref. [59] with using an inter-
actively corrected Planck mean absorption coefficient in the flame
model.

For a stagnation-point burning of a cylindrical fuel, Tao et al. [303]
’’
proposed that the mass burning rate per unit area  ̇m
can be determined
related to the fuel sample radius (r) based on the profiles of temperature
and component, and mixture fraction in stagnant layer. By further
incorporating the relationship between the flame stretch rate and the
sample radius in a stagnation-point flame configuration, the sample
burning rate can be expressed as a function of the stretch rate:

where Ab and Af are two constant coefficients. At very low stretch rate
(cid:0) 1), the burning rate decreases to a low level of
(approximately 1.8 s
about 2 g/m2s (Fig. 46), which is consistent with the work by Johston
et al. at about the same stretch rate [306]. This lowest mass burning rate
is also equivalent to the critical value required to sustain the fire point of
PMMA [61]. Thus, a flame cannot sustain at a further reduced stretch
rate.

6.2.3. Flame standoff distance

The flame standoff distance, directly related to the chemical reaction
and heat transfer processes, is a key length scale. It is typically deter-
mined as the distance from the fuel surface to the flame sheet (peak
temperature), which can be roughly considered as the outer boundary of
the visible flame [291]. Theoretically, in a stagnation-point diffusion
flame geometry, the steady standoff distance yf varies with the equiva-
lent stretch rate as yf∝1/a1/2, due to the balance between thermal
diffusion and convection [307]. Olson and T’ien [291] reported that a
pseudo-steady flame standoff distance was observed at low stretch rates
(cid:0) 1, the
between 3 and 16 s
uniform flame breaks into flamelets. As expected, the steady flame
standoff distance decreases with increasing stretch rate. Low-stretch
experiments using cylindrical PMMA samples conducted in NASA
Glenn’s Zero Gravity Facility (drop tower) [297] showed that flame
standoff distance shows good agreement between the normal-gravity
and microgravity low-stretch flames.

6.2.4. Gas and solid interface energy balance

An energy balance analysis at gas and solid interface is important to
examine the role of radiation and solid-phase conduction heat loss for
these low stretch flames. In the geometry of stagnation-point solid fuel
burning, a solid surface energy balance is formulated as [291]:

interior, the second term is the energy needed for pyrolysis of the solid,
and the last term is the surface radiative loss.

Even though certain experimental complexities such as bubble layer
effect or sample swelling on solid-phase temperature profiles are not
considered in this simplified model, it offers insights into flame dy-
namics across various materials and geometries. In Ref. [291], each term

rad exhibits a local minimum around a
(cid:0) 1, consistent with peak temperature and minimal

non-dimensional standoff distance at the transition from blowoff branch
to quenching branch. When both gas and surface radiation losses were
included [59], the maximum flame temperature showed a turning point
(cid:0) 1, indicating increased radiative losses and a narrower
around 14 s
flammable range for solid fuels. At lower stretch rates, the flame
conductive flux decreases significantly due to large flame standoff dis-
tances and reduced temperatures. The flame heat supply into the solid
surface, i.e. the LHS of Eq. (6.14), decreases as stretch rates decreases,
reflecting characteristics of weak flames typically seen in microgravity.
Olson and T’ien [291] also showed that the percentage of heat loss
(cid:0) 1, only
increased as the flame stretch decreased. At a stretch rate of 3 s
15 % of the heat supplied by flame was used to vaporize fuel, with 85 %
being lost to the solid phase through in-depth conduction and radiated
to the surroundings from the solid surface. At the quenching limit, only
10 % of the flame heat supply was used for fuel vaporization, while 90 %
was lost. This indicates that low-stretch flames are significantly affected
by heat loss. Theoretical models of heat loss and reuse ratios under
microgravity conditions align well with experimental results at a stretch
(cid:0) 1, but cannot yet simulate the complex three-dimensional
rate of 3 s
flamelets phenomena.

6.3. Unsteady low-stretch diffusion flames near extinction

When ambient conditions are altered, such as reducing oxygen
concentration or lowering pressure, the range of stretch rates conducive
to combustion narrows. In such scenarios, low stretch flames are more
susceptible to extinction. As flames approach the extinction limit, they
often exhibit unsteady behavior characterized by various instability
patterns. These instabilities arise from various mechanisms inherent to
the combustion process under these conditions.

6.3.1. Flame instability at reduced oxygen level

Reducing ambient oxygen level (XO2) around a flame can induce
significant flame instability, particularly near extinction limit. For near-
limit diffusion flames, reactant leakage leads to a partially premixed
flame structure. Therefore, mechanisms such as thermal-diffusive
instability, hydrodynamic instability, and heat loss instability that
cause instabilities in premixed flames also induce instabilities in diffu-
sion flames.

In reduced XO2, stagnation-point near-limit combustion of solid fuel
has shown two primary flame instability patterns: flame holes [294] and
edge flame oscillations [40]. Tao et al. [294] found that flame holes form
on the stagnation-point flame surface of a cylindrical PMMA during local
extinction as XO2 decreases (Fig. 47a). These holes first disrupt the
one-dimensional blanket flame, eventually leading to total flame
extinction as XO2 decreases further. Nayagam et al. [308] developed a
model linking flame hole formation to the Damk ̈ohler number (Da)
along the flame sheet. When Da falls below a certain threshold, holes
emerge due to insufficient heat supplied by the flame compared to heat
loss from the hole to the boundaries. In low XO2 environments, Da likely
changes along the flame sheet, linking flame hole formation to Da
reduction and heat loss instability [294].

The unsteady behavior of flames at lower XO2, characterized by
multiple flame holes, is analogous to the flamelet phenomenon observed
(cid:0) 1) [291]. Under these conditions,
at very low stretch rates (less than 3 s
the one-dimensional flame structure fragments
into numerous
three-dimensional flamelets. These flamelets
likely represent a
self-adjusted mode that enhances oxygen flow, ensuring survival
through increased local curvature (stretch).

As the flame approaches the extinction limit with reduced oxygen,
another type of instability, oscillation at the flame edge appears. For a
PMMA rod in microgravity, just before stagnation-point extinction [40,
190,191,298], oscillations in flame length along the axis of concurrent
flow direction were recorded by a radiometer and high-speed video.
These oscillations can be periodic. Different flame extinction modes
were observed at low and high stretch rates. At low stretch rates, just
before quenching limit, a self-sustained cyclic flame pulsation at the
forward flow stagnation point of PMMA sphere was shown. The pulsa-
tions appear to be the result of a premixed flame front spreading into a
combustible mixture [190,191]. When the oxygen concentration grad-
ually depletes to the extinction limit, quenching flame shrinkage from
the upward to the downward stagnation-point (Fig. 47b). The oscillation
frequency of the flame length begins at approximately 1.1 Hz, gradually
decreases to around 1.05 Hz over several seconds, and then undergoes

total

large oscillations. During these large amplitude oscillations, local oxy-
gen depletion can destabilize the flame anchor at the stagnation region,
leading to complete flame extinction. This quenching limit contrasts
with the blowoff extinction observed at higher stretch rates, where a
flame hole first forms at the bottom stagnation region and stabilizes at a
downstream “anchor” point. The flame then oscillates periodically
before
extinction, moving downstream (away from the
stagnation-point) and then flashing forward (upstream) to the same
anchor point (Fig. 47c). For a spherical PMMA, an azimuthal rotation
oscillation occurs after local stagnation-point blowoff. With steady
decrease in oxygen concentration, spinning flamelets are formed
(Fig. 47d). The oscillation instability at flame edge closely resembles the
behavior of candle flames in a quiescent environment [309]. Both os-
cillations before quenching and blowoff extinction are consistent with
the thermal-diffusive instability [309], governed by the diffusive
transport rates of reactants and inherent heat losses [298]. Radiative loss
also alters the thermal-diffusive properties of the reactants, resulting in
oscillations with thermo-diffusive characteristics, even at a unity Lewis
number [310].

6.3.2. Flame instability at increased inert dilution level

From the perspective of fire safety in both the normal and micro-
gravities, the suppression of a wide range of stretched flames using
various agent gases were tested to identify the critical agent volume
fraction necessary for suppression across all global strain rates and to

assess the efficiency of various agents. A counterflow burner, with its
flexible gas supply system, is particularly well-suited for investigating
flame extinction limits at varying stretch rates [311]. To understand fire
suppression mechanisms, dilution gases are often added to either the
fuel or oxidizer sides [296,311]. Near a high-dilution extinction limit,
various flame instabilities emerge. When simulating microgravity
low-stretch flame extinction using a low-stretch counterflow burner, two
types of instabilities are observed near the fuel dilution extinction limit:
periodic flame hole instability at low fuel injection velocities, and stri-
pe/hole instability at higher fuel injection velocities (Fig. 48).

The periodic hole instability is also associated with heat loss insta-
bility mechanism, as discussed in section 6.3.1. Furthermore, the peri-
odicity nature of this hole is attributed to thermal-diffusive instability.
The combined effects of heat loss and thermal-diffusive instabilities are
analyzed through the gas and burner surface heat loss ratios and the
Lewis number [299]. Periodic hole formation occurs only at low fuel
injection velocities (low forced strain rates). Building on previous
findings that stable limit-cycle solutions are present only in the
radiation-induced extinction regime and not in the transport-induced
extinction regime [312], it is inferred that radiative losses primarily
drive the thermal-diffusive instabilities that cause these periodic holes.
Additionally, these periodic holes were observed under conditions of
oxidizer dilution [301]. However, the fuel-dilution and oxidizer-dilution
periodic holes show some differences. In fuel dilution case, the periodic
hole exhibit more regular diameter changes and higher frequencies,

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience111(2025)10125143

Y. Ma et al.

mostly above 1 Hz. Furthermore, the frequency increases with higher
fuel dilution level. In contrast, under oxidizer dilution conditions, the
hole frequencies are less than 1 Hz and increase as the dilution level
decreases.

The stripe/hole instability pattern arises due to the local extinction of
waves and cellular flames as dilution levels increase. The cellular flame
is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability, which can be char-
acterized by a critical Rayleigh number (Ra). The stripe phenomenon
likely occurs because reactants with high diffusivity migrate into the
stronger segments of the reaction sheet, leaving the regions between
these segments deficient in reactants and prone to local quenching
[313]. Therefore, the stripe/hole instability near the extinction limit is
influenced by the combined effects of R-T and thermal-diffusive
instabilities.

6.3.3. Flame instability at reduced gravity

Armstrong et al. [297] reported a transient behavior of cylindrical
PMMA stagnation-point diffusion flames in a drop-tower experiment.
When the gravity changes from 1 g to 0 g, the flame responds rapidly and
non-monotonically to the change in stretch rate. Initially, the flame
experiences a higher stretch rate, which then decreases during the drop
time. This transition is common in drop-tower experiments and simu-
lates the automatic response aboard spacecraft when a fire detector
alarms and the ventilation shuts down. As demonstrated in Fig. 49, at the
onset of the drop, the flame expands away from the fuel surface as the
fuel vapor Stefan flow extends further from the surface due to the
weakening stretch. A transient unsteady flame with a maximum standoff
distance (“overshoot”) is observed at the beginning of the drop, resulting
from the faster response of the gas phase compared to the slower
response of the solid layer. Subsequently, the flame slowly moves back
toward the surface. Finally, at a sufficiently low stretch rate, the flame
has a transition to extinction.

ing buoyancy [315].

6.4. Flammability boundary

As shown in Fig. 9b, a U-shaped extinction boundary typically ap-
pears as varying stretch rate. At higher stretch rates, blowoff extinction
occurs due to incomplete chemical reactions from shorter residence
times. Conversely, at lower stretch rates, quenching extinction is
observed, where flames are cooled by radiative heat losses to tempera-
tures too low to sustain combustion. Both solid-phase and gas-phase
radiation losses are crucial in the stretched flame extinction. A non-
dimensional parameter can be used to estimate the ratio of surface ra-
diation loss to gas-phase heat convection:

where the surface radiation is linearized for approximation. Oh et al.
[314] calculated the LOC of a diffusion flame over a condensed surface
by adjusting surface emissivity and the Planck mean absorption length
of the flame. They found that surface radiation loss from a condensed
fuel accounts for extinction in the low-stretch regime (Fig. 50), while
gas-phase radiation significantly impacts the high-stretch regime.
Increasing surface re-radiation shifts the MLOC toward the high-stretch
regime, while increasing gas-phase radiation shifts the MLOC toward the
low-stretch regime. Both effects ultimately result in an increase in the
MLOC.

6.4.1. Effect of ambient pressure

The two characteristic parameters, Da and Rrad,s (Eq. (6.15)), are
influenced by pressure, where Dan∝Pn(cid:0) 1 for stagnation-point flames and
(cid:0) 0.5 [60], where n is the reaction order. At high pressures, Rrad,s
Rrad,s∝P
is small, thus quenching is suppressed. Meanwhile, Dan can vary with
pressure, either increasing or decreasing depending on n. Note that n =
nf + nO, and for a given n, there are many possible combinations of nf
(fuel reaction order) and nO (oxidizer reaction order). Hsua and T’ien
[60] numerically examined the effect of above parameters on the LOC of
diffusion flames as a function of stretch rate. As shown in Fig. 51a, for an
overall second-order reaction (n = 2) at a pressure of 1 atm, the curves
for nf/nO less than, equal to, and greater than unity, are close to one
another, with the largest differences near the MLOC. Varying nf/nO
while keeping n constant slightly shifts the flame reaction zone relative
to the solid surface. This shift is minimal at high oxygen levels but be-
comes more pronounced at lower oxygen levels, which explains the
increased sensitivity of the extinction limit near the MLOC. The LOC
broadens with increasing pressure (Fig. 51b), with a wider range of
flammable stretch rates and a substantially MLOC when the reaction
order n is greater than unity. When n is less than unity (Fig. 51c), the
low-stretch boundaries behave similarly to those with n greater than
unity, but the high-stretch boundaries move oppositely: higher pressure
is less flammable than lower pressure. The fundamental oxygen limits (i.
e., MLOC) are less sensitive to pressure when n is less than unity, indi-
cating that the reaction order has a more significant influence on high
stretch rate diffusion flames.

6.4.2. Effect of gravity level

An important conclusion from previous studies on equivalent low
stretch flames is that buoyancy-induced low stretch flames have the
same extinction boundary location and shape compared with micro-
gravity forced low stretch flames. This supports the idea that findings
from microgravity and normal gravity experiments can be used to
simulate each other.

The LOC versus the equivalent low stretch rate in normal- and micro-
gravities are compared. As shown in Fig. 52a [298], both the micro-
gravity and normal gravity extinction limits exhibit typical U-shaped
(cid:0) 1. The MLOC is approximately
boundaries with a MLOC at around 10 s
13.5 % in microgravity. In the normal gravity, two extinction modes are
observed: local and total extinction. Local extinction corresponds to

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience111(2025)10125144

Y. Ma et al.

flame holes on the one-dimensional flame surface, while total extinction
involves the entire flame extinction. The MLOC for the total extinction is
lower than that for the microgravity low stretch flames, while the MLOC
for local extinction is higher. This discrepancy arises because the PMMA
sample used in the normal-gravity low-stretch flames was relatively
large, making complete surface extinction more difficult to achieve.
When the flame develops local extinction holes, multi-dimensional
flame structures can emerge, enabling the flame to access additional
oxygen to sustain itself. This unsteady flame hole pattern observed be-
tween the local and total extinction boundaries can, to some extent,
increase the flammable range of the flame. The lowest oxygen level
measured in these normal-gravity low-stretch flames is not, strictly
speaking, the MLOC. In contrast, the smaller PMMA samples in the
microgravity experiments did not consider downstream extinction of the
PMMA rod.

In a microgravity, the critical flame standoff distance follows two
power laws at low and high stretch rates. At low stretch rates, the critical
flame standoff distance yf,cri is proportional to the stretch rate raised to

Theoretically, the scaling relation between flame standoff distance and
stretch rate is yf,cri =
. This theoretical relation applies to high
stretch flames, while for low stretch flames, the standoff distance is
approximately proportional to the cube root of the stretch rate. Similar
results are observed for buoyancy-induced stretched flames in the
normal gravity. As shown in Fig. 52b [294], both the critical flame
standoff distances at LOC in the normal- and micro-gravities exhibit
U-shaped flammability maps The trend reverses at a standoff distance of
(cid:0) 1. The two sides of the
approximately 0.45 cm and a stretch rate of 10 s
U-shaped boundaries correspond to blowoff and quenching limits,
respectively. On the blowoff side, the standoff distance increases as the
oxygen concentration decreases. Conversely, on the quenching side, the
standoff distance increases as the oxygen concentration increases.

Based on the above observations, normal gravity stretched flames
can simulate microgravity stretched flames provided the stretch rate is
the same. However, from a rigorous theoretical perspective, complete
simulation requires identical non-dimensional governing equations,
boundary conditions, and values of non-dimensional parameters.
Achieving such complete match appears infeasible. Therefore, the
stagnation-point low stretch flame simulation represents a partial
similitude, where key parameters of combustion and extinction can be
characterized. This partial similitude enables the screening of materials
for flammability in microgravity through a ground-based testing
method.

6.5. Limitations

In the stagnation-point flame geometry, the primary controlling
parameter is the flame standoff distance. When this scale is matched
between microgravity and normal gravity conditions, several essential
global properties of microgravity flames can be approximately simu-
lated by normal gravity flames. However, since the governing equations
and boundary conditions differ, this simulation is only an approximate
similitude. There are limitations in simulating several local and micro-
scopic properties. For instance, the mechanism of the R-T instability,
which influences normal gravity low stretch flame instability in cellular
flame patterns [299], is unique to gravitational environments. This
instability is usually caused by buoyancy-induced density differences.
For stagnation-point low stretch diffusion flames in a buoyancy flow
field [291], a flamelet instability resembling a Benard cell has been
observed, related to a critical Rayleigh number (Racrit = 460). When Ra
exceeds this critical value, the R-T instability occurs. In experiments
with a larger curved gaseous burner and various dilution gases added to
the fuel stream [299], cellular and wave flames were observed at lower
stretch rates with N2 or CO2 dilutions. The cellular and wave flames
were found to be related to the R-T instability mechanism by solving the

Rayleigh number at different stretch rates and dilution gases. One might
wonder if this flame instability would occur under microgravity since
the R-T mechanism is unique to gravitational conditions. Dunsky [315]
reported flame instability in microgravity, where a cellular tube flame
appears, but with larger size, flame tipping, and irregular cells compared
to normal gravity low stretch cellular flames (Fig. 53). Although the
exact mechanisms remain unclear, hydrodynamic instability is apparent
because the low stretch rates are insufficient to suppress flow-field dis-
turbances by the flame under microgravity. However, the hydrodynamic
instability mechanism is damped by the effects of buoyancy and thermal
diffusivity in the normal gravity conditions.

Therefore, a low stretch flame in the normal gravity cannot be
exactly equivalent to that in microgravity, especially for near-limit
combustions. While similar flame instability phenomena can be
observed in both the normal and micro-gravity conditions, the under-
lying mechanisms can differ. This is primarily due to the differences in
gravity settling force, thermocapillary force, electrostatic force, and
and micro-gravity
thermal-diffusion
environments.

7. Summary and future challenges

Understanding the dynamics of flame spread and extinction under
reduced buoyancy is pivotal for advancing spacecraft fire safety. Key
findings reveal that the suppressed natural convection in low-gravity
environments leads to unique phenomena, including the “smothering”
effects and enhanced radiative heat loss importance, which together
drive the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional flame
structures. These changes significantly impact the fire development,
particularly in terms of the flame spread rates and flammability limits.
This review presents a retrospective analysis of nearly six decades of
theoretical progress in this field, detailing the evolution of classic flame
spread models. Initially grounded in the fundamental “thermal theory”,
these models have been progressively refined to incorporate the effects
of finite-rate chemistry and radiative heat loss, which are critical under
low-gravity conditions.

The pressure-gravity (buoyancy) dependence of key parameters in
determining the flame spread rate is highlighted, and similarity laws
aimed at replicating low-gravity flame behavior in low-pressure envi-
ronments are introduced. Accurate replication is largely limited to
“convection-controlled”
remain,
particularly in reproducing low-gravity flame dynamics due to the dis-
parities in soot-related radiation, flow field similarities, fuel-air mixing,
chemical reaction rates, and condensed-phase effects.

scenarios. Significant

challenges

A detailed assessment of NCA experiments reveals their strengths
and limitations. While NCA can well reproduce the flame spread
behavior over thermally thin materials in microgravity, it struggles with
the thermally thick materials or partial gravity environments, due to
residual gravity and flame-wall interactions. Furthermore, the inherent
enclosure effects of an NCA pose persistent challenges in accurately
replicating the flammability limits of low-gravity environments, where
these limits are highly sensitive to even subtle variations in environ-
mental conditions.

From a more micro perspective, the use of ground-based one-
dimensional stagnation-point flames to simulate low-gravity burning
over various materials is elucidated. While buoyancy-induced flame
stretch rates can well approximate key characteristics such as regression
rates and flammability limits, differences in boundary conditions and
governing equations limit their accuracy in fully replicating micro-
gravity phenomena. Near-limit flame instabilities, though observed
under both conditions, arise from distinct mechanisms in micro- and
normal-gravity environments.

To advance our understanding on this topic, future research needs to

explore several critical areas:

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience111(2025)10125145

Y. Ma et al.

(1) Long-duration, large-scale experiments: Most studies to date have
largely focused on thermally thin materials and laminar flames,
but a significant gap in understanding thermally thick materials
and turbulent flames remain. These areas require attention,
especially given the challenges posed by scale effects and flame
instabilities near extinction-limit. Long-duration, large-scale ex-
periments are essential to explore the fire development, transi-
tions, and full cycle of instability behaviors, as well as to clarify
the differences in instabilities between micro- and normal-
gravities.

(2) Fire extinguishing agent: Flame spread and extinction over solid
materials are limitedly explored in atmospheres with fire extin-
guishing agent. This is crucial for spacecraft fire prevention and
suppression. Current flame spread models are primarily based on
energy equations, and further exploration is needed to incorpo-
rate the physical and chemical properties of fire extinguishing
agents. Some new reaction mechanisms, such as cool flames, may
emerge under reduced buoyancy, and the effectiveness of tradi-
tional extinguishing agents under
still
uncertain.

such conditions

is

(3) Complex material behaviors: The classical flame spread theories
struggle to capture the complex behaviors of multilayers, ther-
moplastic and charring porous materials. Phenomena such as
fuel-vapor jet, Marangoni convection, and smoldering-to-flaming
transition require further investigation. Additionally, the impact
of these complex characteristics on the similarity laws also war-
rants deeper exploration.

(4) Various gravity levels: Research on partial gravity, motivated by
Lunar and Mars exploration, remains in its early stages with
limited experimental data. These studies are essential for under-
standing the nonlinear effects of buoyancy on flame spread and
extinction. Hyper-gravity experiments using centrifuge, which
are more accessible and cost-effective, can magnify gravity-
related physical mechanisms, providing valuable insights into
the behavior under reduced buoyancy.

(5) Advanced diagnostics: Reduced buoyancy introduces the smoth-
ering effect and change the soot formation, which alter the three-
dimensional structure of the flame and the heat flux distribution
over the material surface. High-resolution diagnostics are needed
for precise visualization of these effects. Furthermore, developing
lightweight diagnostic equipment for combustion diagnostics in
low-gravity experiments will be essential for future experimental
advancements.

(6) Integrative

simulation methods: Ground-based simulation
methods have limitations but remain valuable within specific
ranges. Combining multiple methods may help mitigate the
shortcomings of individual approaches. For example, the low-
pressure NCA has been shown to replicate wire ignition in
microgravity effectively [316]. Extending such combined ap-
proaches to flame spread studies could yield optimal strategies.

Finally, numerical simulations and machine learning-based methods
have gained significant attention in fire research, opening new avenues
for advancing our understanding and capabilities in this critical domain.
Experimental studies in reduced buoyancy environments will serve as
benchmarks for evaluating the performance of fire simulation models,
while numerical simulations will provide vital insights into the physical
fields at key points. Although the current volume of low-gravity exper-
imental data remains limited, and predicting flame spread rates and
extinction limits using machine learning remains challenging, these
methods hold great promise in areas such as high-dimensional data
analysis and flow field reconstruction, offering a pathway to overcome
existing limitations.
