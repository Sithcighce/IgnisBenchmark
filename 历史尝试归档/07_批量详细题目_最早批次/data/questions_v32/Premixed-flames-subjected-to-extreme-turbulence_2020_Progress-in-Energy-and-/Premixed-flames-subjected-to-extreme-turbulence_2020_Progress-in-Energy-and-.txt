It has been predicted that several changes will occur when premixed ﬂames are subjected to the extreme 
levels of turbulence that can be found in practical combustors. This paper is a review of recent experi- 
mental and DNS results that have been obtained for the range of extreme turbulence, and it includes a 
discussion of cases that agree or disagree with predictions. “Extreme turbulence” is deﬁned to correspond 
to a turbulent Reynolds number ( Re T , based on integral scale) that exceeds 2800 or a turbulent Karlovitz 
number that exceeds 100, for reasons that are discussed in Section 2.1 . Several data bases are described 
that include measurements made at Lund University, the University of Sydney, the University of Michigan 
and the U.S. Air Force Research Lab. The data bases also include DNS results from Sandia National Lab- 
oratory, the University of New South Wales, Newcastle University, the California Institute of Technology 
and the University of Cambridge. 

Several major observations are: (a) DNS now can be achieved for a realistic geometry (of the Lund 
University  jet  burner)  even  for  extreme  turbulence  levels,  (b)  state  relations  (conditional  mean  pro- 
ﬁles) from DNS and experiments do tend to agree with laminar proﬁles, at least for methane-air and 
hydrogen-air reactants that are not preheated, and (c) regime boundaries have been measured and they 
do not agree with predicted boundaries. These ﬁndings indicate that the range of conditions for which 
ﬂamelet models should be valid is larger than what was previously believed. Additional parameters have 
been shown to be important; for example, broken reactions occur if the “back-support” is insuﬃcient 
due to the entrainment of cold gas into the product gas. Turbulent burning velocity measurements have 
been extended from the previous normalized turbulence levels ( u’/S L ) of 24 up to a value of 163. Tur- 
bulent burning velocities no longer follow the trend predicted by Shchelkin but they tend to follow the 
trend predicted by Damköhler. The boundary where ﬂamelet broadening begins was measured to oc- 
Taylor = 13.8, which corresponds to an integral scale Reynolds number ( Re T ) of 2800. This mea- 
cur at Re 
sured regime boundary can be explained by the idea that ﬂame structure is altered when the turbulent 
diffusivity at the Taylor scale exceeds a critical value, rather than the idea that changes occur when 
Kolmogorov eddies just ﬁt inside a ﬂamelet. A roadmap to extend DNS to complex chemistry and to

1. Introduction – deﬁnitions of a ﬂamelet and extreme 
turbulence 

One motivation for studying premixed ﬂames at extreme levels 
of  turbulence  is  to  determine  when  ﬂamelet  modelling  assump- 
tions become invalid, and to provide information about how to im- 
prove the models. Premixed combustion models often are used to 
compute the properties of lean, premixed pre-vaporized (LPP) gas 
turbine combustors and HCCI (homogeneous charge compression 
ignition) engines. Proper premixing can lead to reduced levels of 
nitric oxide, CO and soot emissions. Premixing also may improve 
the burning of zero carbon fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia, 
as well as low carbon fuels such as natural gas. Even when the 
fuel and air are not initially premixed, they can become premixed 
locally within certain mixing regions, such as the region that is up- 
stream of a lifted ﬂame base. 

It is now well-established that most of the premixed turbulent 
ﬂames that have been investigated to date are composed of wrin- 
kled “ﬂamelets”. This observation has resulted from both experi- 
mental and DNS investigations that were reviewed in Refs. [ 1 , 2 ]. 
References [ 1 , 2 ] only considered research that was conducted at 
moderate levels of turbulence such that the ﬂamelets were wrin- 
kled but preheat layers were not broadened. The present paper in- 
stead considers the range of “extreme” turbulence that can cause 
ﬂamelets to become broadened. This broadening may affect the lo- 
cal  propagation  velocities  and  the  internal  scalar  proﬁles  within 
preheat and reaction zones. Several predictions have been made 
by  Peters  [3] ,  Lewis  and  von  Elbe  [4] ,  Borghi  [5]  and  Williams 

[6] about the levels of turbulence that are required to cause these 
changes. In the current review Section 1 ﬁrst lists the experimen- 
tal and DNS data bases that are available to assess the predictions. 
Then Sections 2–4 describe whether the predictions agree or dis- 
agree with the data. 

To  begin,  we  ﬁrst  present  the  deﬁnitions  of  a  “ﬂamelet” and 
“extreme  turbulence”.  Peters  [3]  deﬁned  a  ﬂamelet  to  have  two 
properties: (a) it is a wrinkled layer that contains both a preheat 
and a reaction region, and (b) its internal structure is deﬁned by a 
set of “state relations” that should similar to, but may not be ex- 
actly equal to, the state relations for a laminar ﬂame. Speciﬁcally, 
state relations are deﬁned to be the conditional mean proﬁles ob- 
tained when species mass fractions are plotted against a progress 
variable such as gas temperature. To generate a state relation for 
OH,  for  example,  mass  fractions  of  OH  and  gas  temperature  are 
recorded  at  many  locations  and  at  many  times,  and  are  plotted 
to form an “OH scatter plot”. The conditional mean proﬁle is the 
curve drawn through  the center  of  the scattered  data. Based on 
this general deﬁnition, ﬂamelets do not have to be thin or contin- 
uous; they may be “thin”, “broadened”, continuous or broken into 
small segments. A ﬂamelet may become broad in physical space, 
but it remains a ﬂamelet as long as its state relations (with phys- 
ical distance replaced by progress variable) do not deviate signiﬁ- 
cantly from laminar state relations. However, if a ﬂamelet becomes 
too  broad  or  too  broken,  it  transitions  from  a  “layer” to  a  “dis- 
tributed reaction”. Peters [3] deﬁned a layer to have scalar gradi- 
ents in one direction that are much larger than those in the other 
two directions. Flamelet models are based on the assumption that

the state relations computed for a strained, laminar ﬂame can be 
used to compute the properties of a turbulent ﬂame, but the mod- 
els do not require that the ﬂamelets remain thin. 

The deﬁnition of “extreme turbulence” is the condition when 
the turbulent Reynolds number (based on integral scales) exceeds 
2800 or when the turbulent Karlovitz number, as deﬁned below, 
exceeds 100. The reasons for selecting these two values are dis- 
cussed in Section 2.1 .

The  relation  for  Ka 

T,P  given  by  Eq.  (2)  was  shown  by  Peters 
[3] to be the ratio of the ﬂame time scale to the Kolmogorov time 
scale. The laminar ﬂame thickness ( δL,P ) that appears in Eq. (2) was 
deﬁned by Peters to be: 
RB / (ρ0 S L ) 
δL,P = (λ/c p ) 

(3) 

where subscript 0 corresponds to the temperature of the un- 
burned  reactants.  In  the  textbook  of  Peters  [3]  on  page  70  it  is 
stated  that  ( λ/ c p )  should  be  computed  at  the  reaction  layer  up- 
stream boundary which is indicated in Eq. (3) by the subscript RB . 
It is recommended that ( λ/ c p ) be evaluated for a temperature of 
1500 K at the reaction layer boundary. This value causes δ
L,P to be 
approximately equal to the measured thermal thickness. If instead 
( λ/c p ) is computed for a temperature of 300 K, then δ
L,P becomes 
unrealistically small and is much thinner than the measured ther- 
mal thickness; thus it would not be an appropriate normalization 
parameter for comparisons to experiment. 

A question that is discussed in Section 2 is: When do ﬂamelets 
exist? One prediction was that extreme turbulence broadens the 
preheat layers but does not alter the scalar proﬁles when they are 
plotted against gas temperature. Speciﬁcally, it has been theorized 
that when the smallest (Kolmogorov) eddies are small enough to 
ﬁt inside preheat layers, broadening of the preheat layers begins 
[3] . For even more intense turbulence the Kolmogorov eddies can 
ﬁt inside the reaction layers. At that limit the reaction layers are 
predicted  to  become  broken  or  distributed.  These  ideas  assume 
that Kolmogorov eddies have suﬃcient rotational velocity to alter 
the strain rates, the mixing rates (i.e., turbulent diffusion) and/or 
the chemistry. Section 2 shows that measured boundaries deviate 
from the predictions. Flamelets persist to larger values of turbu- 
lence level than was previously believed. The broken reaction zone 
boundary depends not only on turbulence levels and eddy size but 
on other factors such as back support (hot or cold gases mixed into 

the products) and the residence time during which strain is im- 
posed. This residence time is large if reaction layers are embedded 
within a shear layer. 

A  related  question  is: What  are  the  measured  boundaries  on 
the  Borghi  regime  diagram  [ 3 , 5 ]?  Some  results  are  described  in 
Section 2 . The Borghi diagram is a theoretical tool and any pre- 
dicted boundaries should not be assumed to be factual until they 
have been experimentally measured or computed using DNS. It of- 
ten is forgotten that the Borghi boundaries have not been mea- 
sured or assessed with DNS until recently. Recent measurements 
indicate that one of the predicted boundaries should be replaced 
by  a  new  boundary.  However,  results  for  one  burner  geometry 
should not be assumed to be applicable to all geometries, so ad- 
ditional measurements and DNS computations are needed. 

A question that is raised in Section 2 is: do eddies have to ﬁt 
inside a preheat layer in order to broaden it, or are somewhat large 
eddies (such as those at the Taylor scale) important? This question 
has not yet been adequately answered, but now we have the DNS 
and measured images of eddies of different sizes as they traverse 
the preheat and reaction layers. It has been predicted that large 
eddies only cause wrinkles that increase the area of ﬂame front, 
and they do not affect the diffusion of heat and species within the 
preheat layers. The smallest (Kolmogorov) eddies are predicted to 
dominate the turbulent diffusion of heat, causing the isotherms to 
become farther apart. However, some results in Section 2.1 indicate 
that diffusion is enhanced by eddies larger than the Kolmogorov 
scale, such as those at the Taylor scale. Section 2.3 discusses when 
distributed combustion occurs, including some predictions and the 
limited amount of experimental evidence. 

Section 3.1 considers the question: Does turbulence cause the 
conditional  mean  proﬁles  (i.e.,  the  state  relations)  within  turbu- 
lent ﬂames to deviate from the state relations for laminar ﬂames? 
Flamelet models normally assume that there is no deviation. The 
conditional  mean  proﬁle  is  deﬁned  to  be  the  curve  that  passes 
through the center of a scatter plot, when instantaneous species 
mole fractions are plotted against a progress variable such as the 
gas temperature. The center of the scatter is deﬁned to be the av- 
erage  value  of  the  scattered  data  within  each  small  segment  of 
the progress variable. Recent DNS and experiments show that for 
methane  fuel,  the  conditional  means  do  tend  to  agree  with  the 
laminar ﬂame state relations. However, for hydrogen fuel and com- 
plex  fuels  one  difference  arises  that  is  due  to  differential  diffu- 
sion. Section 3.2 reviews studies of the combustion of complex fu- 
els such as heptane and dodecane. Early research attempted to use 
the Lewis number to collapse data obtained for different fuels into 
a single curve. However, now it is argued that as the chemistry 
becomes more complex, a single Lewis number is not adequate. 

Section  4  considers  the  question:  Was  Damköhler  correct  in 
predicting that turbulent diffusion causes heat to be rapidly trans- 
ported from products to reactants [4] , which increases the propa- 
gation speed of each segment of a wrinkled ﬂame? He postulated 
that  turbulent  diffusion  causes  the  formula  for  the  normalized 
turbulent  burning  velocity  ( S T /S L )  to  transition  from  Shchelkin’s 
1 ( u ’/ S L ) 2 ) 1/2 at low turbulence lev- 
[4] nearly linear relation: (1 + c 
els to one that exhibits a square root dependence on the turbu- 
lent Reynolds number. The low turbulence relation is not expected 
L ) 2 becomes large compared to unity 
to remain valid when c 
because it predicts that the laminar burning velocity ( S 
L ) cancels 
out. This would imply that turbulent ﬂames propagate at the same 
speed for all equivalence ratios (even zero), which is unrealistic. 
Damköhler’s  relation  that  contains  the  Reynolds  number  avoids 
this problem. Some future challenges are outlined in Section 5 and 
concluding remarks appear in Section 6 . The present review paper 
only considers experimental and DNS results and it does not re- 
view any models. Good reviews of models and some related mod- 
eling assumptions are contained in Refs. [ 3 , 7-11 ].

1.1. List of data bases - for extreme turbulence 

To begin the discussion, it is useful to address the question –
what data bases now exist for the conditions of extreme turbu- 
lence? Table 1 lists data bases [12-48] and Fig. 1 shows some of 
the burner geometries. A general comment about the data bases 
in Table 1 is that there is wide variation in Reynolds numbers and 
Karlovitz numbers. The highest Re 
T of 99,433 was achieved in the 
Hi-Pilot Bunsen burner because the integral scales and turbulence 
intensities were large. Premixed jet ﬂames have large Ka T ,P  near 
the base region, and have large Re 
T near the tip region, since in- 
tegral scales increase with the jet width. Most of the DNS effort s 
were limited to small integral scales, so they often achieve high 
Karlovitz numbers but small Reynolds numbers. 

In Table 1 all values of u ’/ S 

L are 30 or larger and in most cases 
the Karlovitz number Ka T ,P  exceeds 100. Ka T , P  > 100 is the the- 
oretical  boundary  when  broken  reactions  are  predicted  to  occur 
[3] . All of the experiments contain some locations where Re 
T ex- 
ceeds 2800. For consistency, Karlovitz number in Table 1 was com- 
puted  by  applying  Eq.  (2)  to  the  values  of  u ’/ S 
L,P  re- 
ported in each paper. Therefore, due to the differences in deﬁni- 
P  values  in  Table  1  can  differ  by  as  much  as  30% 
tions,  the  Ka T , 

L  and  L x / δ

from values reported in the references. For some studies the val- 
ues of u ’ and integral scale L x were determined in the pure reac- 
tants that lie upstream of any ﬂame brush (for the cases of Bun- 
sen, Low Swirl and turbulence-in-a-box geometries). In other cases 
u’ was determined at locations where both reactants and products 
exist. 

Fig. 1 contains sketches of several burner geometries. Fig. 1 a is 
a schematic of the Michigan Hi-Pilot Bunsen burner [29-34] that 
has  a  21.6 mm  exit  diameter.  The  mean  velocity  of  methane-air 
reactants is as large as 80 m/s; both slots and impinging jets are 
used to increase velocity ﬂuctuations u’ above 30% of the mean ve- 
locity. A Bunsen burner has been used in many previous studies; 
it provides the advantage that the turbulence intensity and inte- 
gral scales in the reactants that enter the ﬂame brush are nearly 
uniform in the core region that extends downstream to about ten 
burner diameters. A shear layer may exist just downstream of the 
brush, but it does not contribute to the turbulence that enters the 
brush, as is demonstrated in Section 2.4 . A pilot ﬂame having a 
108 mm diameter surrounds the main ﬂame in the Hi-Pilot burner. 
The hot product gases from the pilot provide what is called “back- 
support”. The hot pilot gas surrounds the products from the main 
ﬂame to prevent cold room air from being entrained.

Fig. 1 b is a drawing of the Sydney PPJB (premixed piloted jet 
burner)  [35-38]  that  is  the  second  experiment  listed  in  Table  1 . 
Reactants issue from a 4 mm diameter tube at jet exit velocities up 
to 200 m/s. Surrounding the tube is a 23.5 mm diameter pilot ﬂame 
and a 197 mm diameter vitiated co-ﬂow. For jet ﬂames, Karlovitz 
number is large near the jet base and is small near the tip because 
the integral scale is proportional to the jet width. Another burner 
is the LBL Low-Swirl Burner [45] that appears in Fig. 1 c and was 
designed by Cheng et al. [47] . Swirl causes streamlines to diverge, 
resulting in a ﬂat ﬂame brush that has similarities to a counter- 
ﬂow ﬂame. Reaction layers are shear-dominated in the low-swirl 
burner because they are subjected to a continuous mean velocity 
gradient. 

1.2. Description of DNS data bases 

The ﬁrst DNS study listed in Table 1 is that of Wang et al. [12- 
17] . They achieved the only DNS to date of a realistic burner geom- 
etry in the regime of extreme turbulence. They ran two simulations 
of the Lund premixed jet burner (LUPJ) that is a smaller version of 
the Sydney PPJB seen in Fig. 1 b. Wang et al. selected jet exit ve- 
locities of 165 m/s [12] and 110 m/s [13-16] that were matched to 
two experimental conditions. The integral scale was approximated 
in the Lund work to be proportional to the jet halfwidth. As seen 
in Table 1 , the DNS of Wang et al. [12] achieved an impressive tur- 
bulence Reynolds number that exceeded 30 0 0 at downstream lo- 
cations and their Ka T ,P exceeded 350 at upstream locations. Their 
methane-air kinetics mechanism included 28 species. The grid size 
was 30 μm near the reaction layers and at other locations the grid 
was stretched in space. A total of 19,200 processor cores were run 
for 22 days and required ten million CPU hours. 

Fig. 2 a–c show DNS results of Wang et al. [14] for the Lund LUPJ 
premixed jet geometry. The methane reaction rate is conﬁned to 
layers that become about twice as broad at the jet tip than at the 
2 reaction rate regions in Fig. 2 c become even 
ﬂame base. The CO 
broader. Wang et al. [14] reports values of the mixing frequencies 
of different species and the reaction-dissipation balance, both of 
which are useful input to certain LES models. Also computed were 
proﬁles of velocity gradients, mean species concentrations, strain 
rates, progress variable, and progress variable dissipation rates. The 

computed proﬁles were in satisfactory agreement with the Lund 
experiment [13] . 

The second DNS study in Table 1 is that of Aspden et al. [ 18 , 20 ] 
who simulated turbulence in a box using a forcing function that 
was added to the momentum equation to generate extreme levels 
of turbulence. In Ref. [19 ] they report a Ka T ,P of 1562 for hydrogen- 
air  ﬂames  with  a  chemistry  mechanism  involving  nine  species. 
Their computations considered small integral length scales from 1 
to 2 mm, as well as large turbulence levels ( u ’/ S 
L ) up to 170. In a 
later paper [18] they reported achieving the highest Karlovitz num- 
bers to date (8767) and they observed distributed reactions. Fig. 
2 d–g display their burning rates and temperatures. For Ka T , P = 1562 
their reaction layers in Fig. 2 d are broken and locally broadened. 
In their most turbulent case the reaction regions (in Fig. 2 f and 
g) become 15 times thicker than that of a laminar ﬂame and thus 
can be considered to be distributed. Other DNS results are seen in 
Fig. 2 h for turbulence in a box that was computed by Poludnenko 
and Oran [21] ; their ﬂame fronts became very wrinkled and broad- 
ened. 

DNS research [18-28] that has considered turbulence in a box 
provide useful understanding of the relevant physics of turbulent 
premixed ﬂames. However, it is not yet possible to compare such 
results to experiments for several reasons. First, a forcing term is 
added to the momentum equation to generate large velocity ﬂuc- 
tuations. Aspden et al. [18] state that: “A forcing term was used in 
the momentum equations to …allow the turbulence to be main- 
tained rather than decay… and allows arbitrarily large turbulence 
levels that are numerically incompatible with an inﬂow boundary 
condition.” Savard and Blanquart [23] explain “The linear forcing 
method mimics the missing large-scale straining by appending a 
source term to the momentum equation”. It has been argued that 
the  forcing  term  simulates  the  turbulence  that  would  be  gener- 
ated if a shear layer was present. The forcing term creates turbu- 
lence not only upstream of the ﬂame but within the ﬂame brush 
as well. DNS of turbulence in a box applies periodic boundary con- 
ditions that do not occur in experiments. In Ref. [20] it is stated 
that “periodic lateral boundary conditions mean there is a pool of 
hot ﬂuid that is mixed with the fuel.” A third complication is that 
most DNS studies have selected an integral scale of 1 mm or less, 
along with very large velocity ﬂuctuations. Such conditions yield

large Karlovitz numbers that cannot yet be reproduced in experi- 
ments. 

1.3. Description of experimental data bases 

Fig. 3 contains experimental results from the Michigan Hi-Pilot 
data base [29-34] that consists of three parts: (a) ﬂame topology, 
(b) internal scalar and velocity proﬁles and (c) 20 kHz videos of 
dynamic events. Flame topology includes the thicknesses of pre- 
heat  and  reaction  layers  and  the  degree  of  wrinkling  and  local 
extinction  for  27  cases.  Values  of  u ’/ S 
L ,  the  normalized  integral 
scale L x / δL , and Re 
T extend up to 240, 194 and 99,600, respectively. 
Fig.  3  displays gas  temperatures  (from  Rayleigh  scattering  imag- 
ing), as well as formaldehyde (CH 
2 O), hydroxyl (OH) and CH PLIF 
(Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence) images. Reaction layers were 
identiﬁed by the overlap method, which involves taking the pixel- 
by-pixel product of simultaneously acquired PLIF images of OH and 
CH 
2 O. The second method was to acquire PLIF images of CH, which 
mark the reaction layers, since CH is a short-lived radical that re- 
sides near the peak heat release region. The Hi-Pilot data base in- 
cludes a plot of the new Measured Regime Diagram [30] as well 
as instantaneous and time-averaged proﬁles for 20 cases. Proﬁles 
of progress variable (i.e., the normalized temperature) are deduced 
from Rayleigh scattering data. In addition, the Hi-Pilot data base 
includes a full set of velocity ﬁeld images obtained using PIV (Par- 
2 O PLIF has been shown to be an ac- 
ticle Image Velocimetry). CH 
curate marker of the preheat zone since CH 
2 O diffuses upstream 
in a manner similar to the diffusion of heat [ 32 , 43 ]. CH is a good 
marker of the center of the reaction layer. 

Some results from the PPJB burner that were reported by Dunn 
et al. [35-38] are seen in Fig. 4 a–c, including images of OH PLIF, 
gas temperatures and temperature gradients. They applied Raman–
Rayleigh–LIF  with  cross  plane  OH  PLIF  to  record  proﬁles  of  ma- 
2 ) and gas 
jor species (e.g. N

temperature. Two OH PLIF sheets intersect with the Raman laser 
beam to identify the location of the instantaneous reaction surface 
and to facilitate corrections for the laser-line being misaligned with 
the ﬂame-surface normal. They also recorded proﬁles of turbulence 
level and mean velocity. 

The Lund piloted jet ﬂame (LUPJ) [39-44] is a smaller version 
of the Sydney PPJB that appeared in Fig. 1 b. Reactants issue from 
a small 1.5 mm diameter tube with exit velocities up to 400 m/s. 
Integral scales were not measured but were assumed to be pro- 
portional to the jet halfwidth, which is approximately one-tenth of 
the value of x/d . Essentially all of the turbulence exerted on the 
ﬂame in a jet burner originates in the jet shear layer and not in 
the  central  tube  that  provides  the  reactants.  The  central  tube  is 
surrounded by a pilot ﬂame that provides hot products to prevent 
cold room-air from being entrained. Table 1 indicates if the pre- 
heat layer or the reaction layers of the aforementioned studies are 
broadened. Preheat layer broadening is deﬁned to occur when lay- 
ers become more than three times thicker than those of an associ- 
ated laminar ﬂame. The Lund LUPJ data base contains information 
about ﬂame structure, as seen in Fig. 4 d–e. Zhou et al. applied PLIF 
diagnostics to image CH, CH 

2 O, HCO and OH. 

Results from the low swirl burner have been described in Refs. 
[45-47] . Another experiment listed in Table 1 is that of Sosa et al. 
[48] which has a geometry that is similar to the geometry of the 
DNS  of  Poludnenko  and  Oran  [ 21 , 22 ].  In  both  cases  a  premixed 
ﬂame accelerates in a rectangular channel in which there are large 
imposed pressure gradients. In the experiment, a shock wave ﬁrst 
passes through reactants to create turbulence as well as a strong 
pressure  gradient.  Then  in  the  subsonic  region  a  turbulent  pre- 
mixed ﬂame accelerates. Because of the strong imposed pressure 
gradient, the ﬂame creates new turbulence due to the baroclinic 
torque mechanism. 

While the present paper focuses on extreme turbulence, there 
are several other data bases that have been recorded at “interme-

tains  8  cases  for  which  the  pilot  and  main  equivalences  ratios 
were  matched  (four  cases  were  matched  to  within  4%  and  four 
were matched to within 7%). Six other Hi-Pilot cases were nearly- 
matched (to within 16%). For the LUPJ burner, the pilot and main 
equivalence ratios were nearly-matched for the nearly stoichiomet- 
ric cases, but for a few cases the LUPJ main ﬂame was run below 
the lean ﬂammability limit and the pilot ﬂame was nearly stoichio- 
metric. Tamadonfar and Gülder reported an extensive data base; in 
some of their cases their pilot and main ﬂame equivalence ratios 
and fuel types were matched, but in other cases their pilot fuel 
(ethylene) differed from that of their main ﬂame (methane). 

For  a  laminar  Bunsen,  jet  or  counterﬂow  ﬂame,  the  product 
gases always are convected downstream. This also is true for tur- 
bulent ﬂames subjected to low levels of turbulence. However, with 
extreme  levels  of  turbulence,  large-scale  turbulent  motions  can 
sometimes convect the pilot gases far upstream and into the re- 
actants. A mismatch of the pilot and main ﬂame equivalence ratios 
could affect the frequency of local extinction events and the scalar 
proﬁles of gas composition. The role of pilot-main ﬂame mismatch 
has not been quantiﬁed, but the idea has been explored in Refs. 
[49-51] . Pilot ﬂames also have been employed in many other ex- 
periments, such as the non-premixed jet ﬂame that is called San- 
dia Flame D. A number of comparisons have been made between 
experiments and models, for cases when the pilot and main ﬂames 
have different equivalence ratios. 

2. When do ﬂamelets exist? 

We repeat here Peters’ [3] deﬁnition of a ﬂamelet; it is a wrin- 
kled layer that contains both preheat and reaction regions, and it 
contains  proﬁles  of  species  mass  fractions  (versus  progress  vari- 
able, called state relations or conditional mean proﬁles) that are 
similar to those of a laminar ﬂame. Based on this general deﬁni- 
tion, ﬂamelets may be broadened, thin, continuous or broken, but 
if they become too broad they are no longer layers and are called 
distributed reactions. Peters and Co-authors [ 3 , 4 , 6 ] predicted that 
as turbulence level increases, small eddies enter the preheat layer 
and cause thin ﬂamelets to become broadened. The eddies cause 
an increase in the sum of the molecular and turbulent diffusivities. 
However, Peters argued that when the preheat layers broaden, 
the  reaction  layers  may  not.  That  is,  reaction  layers  may  extin- 
guish before they begin to broaden. One possible explanation why 
reaction  layers  do  not  broaden  is  based  on  the  Semenov  theory 
of a premixed laminar ﬂame that is outlined in the textbook by 
Kuo  and  Acharya  [72] .  The  preheat  layer  equations  represent  a 
balance between convection and diffusion terms. In the reaction 
layer, Semenov’s theory assumes that diffusion terms are small, so 
the equations represent a balance between convection and reac- 
tion terms. While DNS shows that diffusion terms do not disappear 
in the reaction layer, they are smaller than in the preheat layer.

diate” turbulence levels of u ’/ S L  up to 25. Some of these investi- 
gations [52-71] are listed in Table 2 . They considered the geome- 
tries of a slot Bunsen burner [ 52 , 53 ], a plane jet [54] , as well as 
stratiﬁed, swirl and bluff-body burners [64-71] . Fig. 5 shows some 
typical DNS results achieved for this intermediate range of turbu- 
lence. The isotherms plotted in Fig. 5 are wrinkled but are not as 
contorted  as  the  isolines  seen  in  Figs.  2-4  for  the  extreme  tur- 
bulence cases. DNS results of Bell et al. [55] were in agreement 
with measurements made in the Michigan slot burner. Table 2 lists 
some  cases  when  preheat  layers  are  broadened  by  a  relatively 
small  amount  (20%).  Preheat  layer  thicknesses  in  the  intermedi- 
ate range were reported by Kariuki et al. [ 68 , 69 ] and by Chowd- 
huri and Cetegen [ 70 , 71 ]. Review papers [ 1 , 2 ] provide more details 
about experiments and DNS for the intermediate range of turbu- 
lence. 

It  is  noted  that  pilot  ﬂames  are  used  to  provide  hot  prod- 
ucts that surrounded all of the jet, Bunsen and slot burners [ 29- 
44 , 52 , 53 , 60-63 ]  listed  in  Tables  1  and  2 .  However,  pilot  ﬂames 
were not employed for any of the bluff-body experiments [68-71] . 
The pilot gas ensures that the main ﬂame does not blow-off and 
it prevents any entrained room air from reaching the main ﬂame. 
The equivalence ratios of the pilot and main ﬂames were nearly 
matched for many of Hi-Pilot, PPJB and LUPJ cases, but they were 
mismatched for a few cases when the main ﬂame was operated 
fuel-lean.  A  few  lean  conditions  are  desirable  because  they  pro- 
vide large values of Ka T , 
P and u’/S L . For these cases the pilot had 
to  remain  nearly  stoichiometric  or  else  both  the  pilot  and  main 
ﬂames would blow off. For example, the Hi-Pilot data base con-

Cases 5A, 6B, 6A, Re T = 58,200, 22,300, 99,600; u’/S L = 80, 77, 123; Ka T,P = 57, 85, 103, for (a, b, c) respectively. Reprinted from Skiba et al. [30] with permission of Elsevier. 

By this reasoning, increasing the turbulent diffusivity should cause 
more broadening of the preheat layer than the reaction layer. 

Figs. 6 and 7 a are from Skiba et al. [30] . The CH 

2 O PLIF signal 
in Fig. 6 a has been shown to be an accurate marker of the pre- 
heat layer, since CH 
2 O is formed in the reaction layer but rapidly 
diffuses upstream throughout the preheat layer, in a manner sim- 
2 O –OH overlap images 
ilar to the diffusion of heat [ 32 , 43 ]. The CH 
and  the  CH  PLIF  results  in  Fig.  6 b  and  c  are  good  indicators  of 
the  reaction  layers.  They  found  that  preheat  layers  were  broad- 
ened by a factor of 10, but their reaction layers were not broad- 
ened signiﬁcantly, even when turbulence levels were increased by 
T  was as large as 
a factor of 60 (from u’/S L  of 4 to 240). Their Re 
99,600 and they achieved a Ka T , P  of 580, which is 5.8 times the 
predicted broken reaction layer limit [3] . The reaction layers in Fig. 
6 b and c are seen to remain thin, and are quantiﬁed by the mea- 
sured mean thickness values that are make up the nearly horizon- 
tal lower curve in Fig. 7 a. 

Dunn  et  al.  [35-38]  reported  that  their  preheat  layers  were 
broadened. Some of their results appear in Fig. 4 a–c, while Fig. 7 b 
is a plot of temperature gradients that are conditioned on the gas 
temperature.  The  lower  curve  has  a  peak  value  that  is  smaller 
than upper curve. This indicates that preheat zones becomes sig- 
niﬁcantly thicker as their turbulence levels increased by a factor 
of three. Chowdhury and Cetegen [ 70 , 71 ] concluded that preheat 
layers were broadened but reaction layers were not. At Lund Uni- 
versity, Zhou et al. [39-42] observed broadened preheat layers. Re- 
action layers were not signiﬁcantly broadened at the midpoint of 
their jet ﬂame, but reaction layers were broadened by a factor of 
2.7 near the tip region, as is seen in Fig. 7 c. The upper curve in 
Fig.  7 c  is  the  thickness  of  HCO  layers  while  the  lower  curve  is 
2 O –OH  overlap  PLIF  signal;  both  curves 
the  thickness  of  the  CH 
are nearly the same. In summary, four experiments [ 30 , 35 , 39 , 70 ] 
showed that preheat layers are broadened by turbulence. Reaction 
layers were not broadened signiﬁcantly in three of these studies,

but in a fourth study they were broadened by a factor of 2.7 in 
the work of Zhou et al. [39-42] but only near their ﬂame tip. Zhou 
et al. explain that reaction layer broadening at their ﬂame tip is 
partially due to the merging of nearby ﬂamelets, rather than by 
turbulence alone. 

A  number  of  DNS  studies  [ 13 , 17 , 20 ]  listed  in  Table  1  report 
agreement with experiments in that they showed that extreme tur- 
bulence broadens the preheat layers. For instance, in the jet ﬂame 
simulation of Wang et al. [13-17] there was a three-fold broadening 
of preheat layers at the axial location where Ka T,P exceeds 150 and 
u’/S L > 53. A plot of their temperature gradients is similar to the 
measurements in Fig. 7 b. Their work quantiﬁes the competition be- 
tween the broadening of layers due to turbulence and the thinning 
of layers due to the positive stretch rates that are imposed. Their 
results help explain previous measurements that showed that tur- 
bulence of low intensity (and large integral scales) causes a reduc- 
tion in the preheat layer thickness, while extreme turbulence has 
the opposite effect. DNS of Aspden et al. [18-20] achieved Ka T,P of 
1567 and 8767 that caused a fourfold broadening of preheat lay- 
ers. Poludnenko and Oran [ 21 , 22 ] computed the highly wrinkled 
ﬂamelets seen in Fig. 2 h. It was concluded that “the preheat zone 
is broadened by turbulence while the reaction-zone structure re- 
mains virtually identical to that of the planar laminar ﬂame.” In 
summary, there is signiﬁcant evidence from experiments and from 
DNS that extreme turbulence broadens preheat layers but does not 
broaden reaction layers, except where ﬂamelets merge. 

2.1. What is the new measured boundary of ﬂamelet broadening? 

The  last  section  presented  evidence  that  preheat  layers  are 
broadened,  but  a  question  is:  Does  the  measured  boundary  of 
ﬂame front broadening agree with theory? The predicted bound- 
aries on the Borghi regime diagram [3] are sketched in Fig. 8 a. It is 
noted that these boundaries are quoted often, but they have never 
been measured until recently. Fig. 8 b shows results from four ex- 
periments. Piloted Bunsen burners were operated at the Universi- 
ties of Toronto and Michigan and at AFRL, while piloted jet ﬂames 
were  run  at  the  University  of  Sydney  and  Lund  University  [29- 
44] . Solid symbols corresponded to broadened preheat layers while 
open  symbols  correspond  to  thin  preheat  layers.  The  conditions 
associated with each data point are tabulated in Ref. [30] . Thick- 
nesses  of  preheat  layers  were  determined  using  either  Rayleigh 
scattering or formaldehyde (CH 

2 O) PLIF diagnostics. 

The previous prediction [3] is that the solid symbols (broadened 
preheat layers) in Fig. 8 b should lie above the lower (dashed red) 
theoretical  line,  while  the  open  symbols  (thin  ﬂamelets)  should 
lie below this line. For conditions above the red dashed line, the 
Kolmogorov eddies ﬁt inside the laminar ﬂame thickness. The red 
dashed  line  corresponds  to  Ka T,P = 1  and  has  a  slope  of  ( + 1/3). 
The positive slope implies that a smaller integral scale is predicted 
to be more effective at broadening a ﬂamelet than a larger inte- 
gral  scale.  However,  in  contrast  to  the  predictions,  it  is  seen  in 
Fig. 8 b that the predicted boundary (red dashed line) does not sep- 
arate the solid symbols from the open symbols. Instead, the solid 
and open symbols are better separated by the solid black line in 
Fig. 8 b; this black line is denoted the measured boundary and it 
has a slope of ( −1). 

Therefore, the measured boundary of preheat layer broadening 

is represented by two equivalent relations: 
u (cid:3)

This  experimental  observation  can  be  written  the  following 

way:

by  replacing  the  ﬂame  thickness δL,P  in  Eq.  (4a)  with  its  deﬁni- 
tion in Eq. (3) . The value of 2800 in Eq. (4b) depends on the value 
of 180 in Eq. (4a) and the molecular Prandtl number of 0.7. Since 
Eq. (4b) indicates that when Re 
T exceeds 2800 signiﬁcant preheat 
layer broadening occurs, this value of 2800 is selected to deﬁne 
the  extreme  turbulence  range.  The  integral  scale  ( L x )  appears in 
Eqs.  (4a)  and  ( 4b )  only  because  it  is  a  parameter  in  the  Borghi 
regime diagram.

A better way to represent the boundary of preheat broadening 
is to replace the quantities u’ and L x in Eq. (4b) with the following 
deﬁnitions of the Taylor length and velocity scales [72] :

Now  eliminate  u’  and  L x  from  Eqs.  (5a)  and  (5b) .  Note  that  Eq.

(5b) indicates that u’ equals [u’

that L x equals [ λ

the value for L x , it is shown that L x equals [( λ

( ν
Taylor ) 3/2  ( λ

These two quantities then are inserted into Eq. (4b) to show that

(Re

Therefore, Eq. (5c) indicates that the measured boundary is a 
line where the Taylor scale Reynolds number is constant and equal 
to 13.8. This is a pure measurement, since it is based only on a 
measurement ( Eq. (4a) ) and deﬁnitions. It is not based on any the- 
ory or assumptions.

Although  no  theory  exists  that  predicts  Eq.  (5c) ,  a  proposed 
explanation  was  offered  by  Skiba  et  al.  [30] .  The  numerator  in 
Eq. (5c) is deﬁned to be the turbulent diffusivity at the Taylor scale, 
which is: 

D 

(cid:3)

(6) 

Eq. (6) is based on the deﬁnition of turbulent diffusivity ﬁrst 
proposed by Prandtl [ 4 , 72 ]. He noted that the molecular diffusivity 
is the product of the mean thermal velocity of molecules and a 
molecular collision distance that is called the mean free path. By 
analogy, he argued that the turbulent diffusivity contribution (at 
any scale) is the product of the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations and 
the eddy diameter associated with eddies of that scale. 

Therefore,  a  physical  explanation  of  the  measurements  in 
Fig. 8 is that ﬂamelet broadening begins when the turbulent dif- 
fusivity at the Taylor scale exceeds the value of 13.8 ν
300K . It has 
not yet been determined if Taylor scale eddies dominate the diffu- 
sion process, but they are known to be important contributors to 
the ﬂuid mechanical strain rate. Taylor eddies are small enough to 
create large velocity gradients, yet they are much larger than the 
Kolmogorov eddies, so they contain signiﬁcantly more turbulent ki- 
netic energy. Yuen and Co-authors [61-63] previously argued that 
Taylor scale eddies are strong enough to alter ﬂame structure. 

It can be concluded from the experimental data in Fig. 8 that: 

a) The solid black line Re 

Taylor  = 13.8 separates nearly all of the 
cases of measured broadened preheat layers from cases of thin 
preheat layers. Thus, the experiments indicate that a suﬃcient 
turbulent diffusivity at the Taylor scale (which is proportional 
to Re 

Taylor ) is required to broaden preheat layers. 

b) The line Ka T,P = 1.0 (that was predicted [3] to be the boundary 
of  broadened  preheat  layers)  is  seen  in  Fig.  8 b  to  not  agree 
with the measurements. The Kolmogorov scale argument that 
broadening begins when the Kolmogorov scale just ﬁts inside 
the laminar ﬂame thickness is not consistent with the experi- 
mental data. 

c) If the integral scale L x is increased, for a constant level of turbu- 
lence ( u’ / S 
L ), then the conditions move the right in Fig. 8 b and 
measurements indicate that preheat layers are more likely to be 
broadened, since the measured boundary has a negative slope. 
The opposite trend was predicted by the theoretical boundary 
(the red dashed line in Fig. 8 b) that represents a constant Ka T,P 
and has a positive slope. 

d) Taylor scale eddies previously have been suggested by Gülder 
[61-63]  and  others  to  be  important  because  they  are  much 
stronger than Kolmogorov eddies, yet they are small enough to 
overlap (if not ﬁt inside) the preheat layers, unlike the larger 
integral scales. 

e) The words “extreme turbulence” are selected to describe condi- 
T exceeds 2800 because that is where Eq. (4b) in- 

tions when Re 
dicates deviations from thin preheat layers were measured. 

Sometimes it has been assumed that the strain rate, rather than 
turbulent diffusivity, causes the broadening of preheat layers. Each 
small Kolmogorov eddy exerts a large strain rate, but only for a 
short time, since these eddies typically decay after one rotation. 
Egolfopoulos and Campbell [73] showed that large strain rates have 
no effect on a ﬂame if the strain rates oscillate at too high of a fre- 
quency. That is, short intense burst of positive and negative strain 
rates tend to cancel each other out due to their short residence 
times. Egolfopoulos and Campbell [73] showed that there is an op- 
timum time during which strain rate should be imposed; this time 
should exceed a characteristic diffusion time that allow the chem- 
ical reactions to adjust to the new imposed conditions. The work 
of Egolfopoulos and Campbell casts doubt on the prediction that 
broadening ﬁrst occurs when small Kolmogorov eddies just begin 
to ﬁt inside a ﬂame thickness. 

Several  words  of  caution  are  needed  when  discussing  the 
Borghi regime diagram. The measured boundary of broadening in 
Fig. 8 b was determined using data from only four experiments - 
two piloted Bunsen burners (at Michigan and Toronto) and two jet 
burners (the Sydney PPJB and Lund LUPJ). Full data sets from other 
geometries  are  needed  to  assess  the  generality  of  Fig.  8 b.  There 
is one DNS data point that could be plotted on Fig. 8 b; the DNS of 
Wang et al. [13] was conducted for the same conditions as the LUPJ 
experiment [39] and their results do agree with the experimental 
ﬁnding that LUPJ preheat layers are broadened. As more experi- 
mental and DNS information becomes available, it can be argued 
that plotting results on a Borghi plot is a useful ﬁrst step. Then the 
research community can decide if a Borghi plot (or some variation 
of it) continues to be a useful indicator of the various regimes. 

2.1.1. Role of Taylor scale and larger eddies 

A conventional idea has been that eddies at the integral scale 
only cause large-scale wrinkling of reaction layers, and the small- 
est eddies control the turbulent diffusion of heat and the strain 
rates. Since small eddies are fairly uniformly distributed in space, 
this idea suggests that small eddies would uniformly increase the 
distances between the wrinkled isotherms in the preheat layers. 
The isotherms could be expected to resemble a set of wavy, yet 
parallel curves. That is, if the effect of small eddies is equivalent 
to simply increasing the molecular diffusivity, then ﬂame structure 
should resemble a wrinkled laminar ﬂame that has uniformly sep- 
arated isotherms. Experiments and DNS contradict this idea. Fig. 9 
shows examples of highly irregularly-shaped isolines that contain 
peninsulas of hot gas that extend into the reactants, which rep- 
resents  one  type  of  the  turbulent  diffusion  of  heat.  Fig.  9 a  dis- 
plays  isotherms  determined  from  the  Rayleigh  scattering  images 
recorded in the Hi-Pilot burner. The lower black region marks the 
cold reactants. The isotherms have many ragged peninsulas where 
hot  products  extend  into,  and  mix  with,  the  reactants.  The  gas 
temperature proﬁle in Fig. 9 b does not rise smoothly but jumps up

red line contains products. It cannot be not argued that all of the 
turbulent diffusion of heat is due to this type of large-scale mo- 
tion, but Fig. 10 indicates that large eddies do contribute to the 
turbulent diffusion process. More research is needed that provides 
resolution of the Kolmogorov scales, in order to quantify the rela- 
tive contributions of large and small eddies. 

The eddy in Fig. 10 is seen to be strong enough to transport 
hot gas from the products into the reactants. Thus the eddy rota- 
tion has added a velocity in the upstream direction that can com- 
pete  against  the  velocity  ﬁeld  in  the  downstream  direction  that 
has  been  added  by  gas  expansion.  To  estimate  this  latter  veloc- 
ity, consider a laminar methane-air ﬂame. Reactants approach at 
the  laminar  ﬂame  speed  of  0.4 m/s  and  the  products  are  likely 
to move downstream at 2.4 m/s, so gas expansion adds a veloc- 
ity in the downstream direction of approximately 2 m/s. This value 
is more than an order of magnitude greater than the typical rota- 
tional velocity of a Kolmogorov eddy, but it is comparable to the 
rotational velocities of Taylor scale eddies that can be computed 
using Eq. (5b) . 

The role of relatively large eddies recently was investigated by 
Doan et al. [74] and Ahmed et al. [75] . A novel band-pass ﬁlter was 
applied to their DNS results to quantify the contribution of eddies 
of various sizes. Eddies at least twice the size of the laminar ﬂame 
thickness were found to be most effective at straining the ﬂame 
front. In contrast, eddies smaller than the laminar ﬂame thickness 
accounted for less than 10% of the total straining. Their results are 
consistent with the discussion above; there is evidence that rela- 
tively large eddies play a more signiﬁcant role than previously was 
believed. In 1979 Zimont [76] stated his belief that suﬃciently in- 
tense turbulence can penetrate a ﬂame and make it broader. Once 
it is broader, then larger eddies can in turn penetrate it until an 
equilibrium is reached. 

To summarize this section, the measured boundary of ﬂamelet 
broadening has been found to occur where the turbulent diffusivity 
(based on the Taylor scale) exceeds a certain value, and not where 
Kolmogorov eddies just ﬁt inside the laminar ﬂame thickness. Im- 
ages of eddy-induced motions from experiments and DNS support 
this idea. It still is not known if the Taylor scale is most eﬃcient 
scale for the turbulent diffusion of heat, but laser diagnostics and 
DNS soon may be able to achieve the resolution required to answer 
this question. 

2.2. Broken reaction layers - when do they occur? 

The broken ﬂamelet regime in this paper is deﬁned to occur 
when  more  than  10%  of  the  perimeter  of  the  reactant-product 
boundary is extinguished at many different locations, to form small 
disconnected segments of reaction layers. It was predicted [3] that 
the only requirement for broken ﬂamelets to exist is for turbulence

rapidly where hot products are forced into cold reactants. Similarly, 
Fig. 9 b and c display the DNS isotherms and reaction rate contours 
of Sankaran et al. [52] and Wang et al. [13] . Arrows mark where 
hot gases are entrained over a long distance into the reactants. 

The  shapes  of  the  isotherms  in  Fig.  9  appear  to  be  caused 
by rotational velocities that are induced by large eddies. Support 
of this idea is provided by the measurements seen in Fig. 10 . A 
large (1.5 mm diameter) eddy interacts with a ﬂame in the Hi-Pilot 
burner of Skiba et al. [31] . A 20 kHz video of the vorticity ﬁeld was 
recorded and the eddy is marked a thin isovorticity line that sur- 
rounds a red vorticity region. The hydraulic diameter of the eddy 
initially is 2.5 mm while its time-averaged diameter is 1.5 mm. This 
is more than three times the laminar ﬂame thickness of 0.48 mm. 
This eddy does not ﬁt inside a laminar ﬂamelet. The eddy diameter 
is one ﬁfth of the longitudinal integral scale and is ﬁve times the 
Taylor scale that was computed using Eq. (6) . Smaller eddies at the 
Taylor scale could not be resolved. A red arrow indicates the direc- 
tion of the induced rotational velocity. The black and magenta lines 
mark the ﬂame leading edge and trailing edge, respectively. The 
diagnostics employed were simultaneous 20 kHz stereo PIV, CH 
2 O 
PLIF and OH PLIF. 

Fig. 10 shows how the large eddy creates turbulent diffusion of 
heat by causing the ﬂame to roll up, leading to a peninsula of hot 
gas that extends into the reactants. The gas between the black and 
red lines contains heated intermediates; the gas to the left of the

levels to be suﬃciently large or for integral scale to be suﬃciently 
small such that Ka T,P  exceeds 100. This criterion deﬁnes the up- 
per curve plotted on the Borghi diagram in Fig. 8 a. Table 3 lists 
2 O –OH 
several  effort s  to  image  broken  ﬂamelets  by  applying  CH 
PLIF overlap diagnostics. The ﬁrst ﬁve studies in Table 3 reported 
extinguished  regions  that  appear  to  be  less  than  approximately 
10% of the ﬂame perimeter, based on the small number of images 
that were published. The sixth study reported several cases run by 
Skiba et al. [30] who observed essentially no local extinction, even 
for values of Ka T,P  up to 533, which is 5.33 times the predicted 
broken regime boundary [3] . 

Experimental evidence now indicates that, in addition to Ka T,P , 
two other factors are important: “back-support” and the presence 
of a steady-state strain rate. “Poor back-support” is deﬁned to oc- 
cur when pockets of cool gas are entrained into the product side 
of the ﬂame. This entrainment can be prevented by surrounding 
the  main  ﬂame  with  a  suﬃciently  large  diameter  pilot  burner. 
A  steady-state  strain  rate  is  imposed  by  certain  burners,  includ- 
ing  counter-ﬂow,  bluff-body,  spherical  and  low-swirl  geometries. 
Steady-state  strain  rates  are  not  imposed  by  Bunsen  or  V-ﬂame 
burners. 

The  ﬁrst  two  experiments  listed  in  Table  3  have  yielded  the 
images shown in Fig. 11 a and b. Arrows mark locations of small 
segments  where  ﬂamelets  are  broken.  Kariuki  et  al.  [ 68 , 69 ]  and 
Chowdhury  and  Cetegen  [ 70 , 71 ]  ran  bluff-body  experiments  and 
no pilot ﬂame was used to prevent cold room air from being en- 
trained. The CH 
2 O and OH boundaries are seen to be rolled up by 
large eddies within the annular steady-state shear layer that begins 
at the lip of the bluff body. Additional images appear in Fig. 11 c 
and d that were recorded in the piloted jet burner of Zhou et al. 

2 O –OH overlap 
[39-42] and Dunn et al. [35] , who used HCO –or CH 
diagnostics. Jet ﬂames do impose strong steady-state strain rates 
near the base of the jet, and Dunn et al. did observe one large re- 
gion of extinction, followed by re-ignition downstream where the 
strain rates become smaller. Near the tip of the jet ﬂame only a 
few extinction regions occur; they are marked with arrows in Fig. 
11 c and d. Since Karlovitz number is much smaller at the tip of a 
jet ﬂame than near the base, it is possible that these few extinction 
regions are due to some outside cool air that may have been en- 
trained. Dunn et al. did not show many extinction regions in their 
reported images. 

Skiba et al. [30] investigated the role of variable back-support 
by running a few cases that intentionally had degraded back sup- 
port. The ﬂow rate of their pilot ﬂame was reduced, and 10 kHz 
videos  were  recorded  with  a  single  camera  of  both  CH  and  OH 
PLIF. In Fig. 12 the reactants exist within the black region seen in 
the lower left, while products are marked by the light colored OH 
region in the center. The reaction layer is the boundary between 
the black and the OH regions, where a thin region of CH PLIF sig- 
nal is marked by a white line. The blue region in the upper right 
is a pocket of cool air from the room that was entrained into the 
products. The CH reaction layer moves up and to the right toward 
the blue pocket of cool air. A red line is drawn to show the extinc- 
tion region where the CH signal has disappeared. 

The DNS study of Wang et al. [13] did not report any broken 
regions  of  the  primary  reaction  layers  that  were  seen  above  in 
Fig. 2 a. They ran DNS for the largest Karlovitz number (1400) yet 
achieved for a realistic burner geometry. The only broken layers 
2 reactions 
that they report are locally extinguished regions of CO 
in the upstream region in Fig. 2 c. Thus, it is concluded that the

were 10 kHz simultaneous OH and CH PLIF; reprinted from Skiba et al. [30] with permission of Elsevier. 

DNS of Wang et al. is in general agreement with experiments. That 
is, they operated at a Ka T,P that exceeded 100 and had back sup- 
port from a pilot that provided a surrounding ﬂow of hot products, 
and their heat release layers were continuous and were not signif- 
icantly broken. The Wang et al. work demonstrates the importance 
of simulating the entire 3-D geometry of a burner, and not just a 
small box that represents a segment of the ﬂame brush. If a shear 
layer is present, it is important to compute where the ﬂame is lo- 
cated within the shear layer to determine the magnitude of the 
imposed  strain  rate  in  order  to  draw  general  conclusions.  Other 
relevant studies of extinction are described in Refs. [49-51] . The 
DNS work of Bouaniche et al. [51] concluded that with suﬃcient 
back support, premixed ﬂames can avoid extinction even at very 
large values of Ka T,P . Aspden et al. [18-20] reported the broken re- 
action layers that were seen in Fig. 3 d. It is noted that sometimes 
corrugated ﬂamelets are erroneously assumed to be broken. Corru- 
gated ﬂamelets contain continuous reaction layers that appear as 
rings around individual pockets of reactants or products. The pock- 
ets are separated from each other, but if the ring-shaped reaction 
layer around each pocket does not end in space, then it is not bro- 
ken. 

It can be concluded from the experiments listed in Table 3 that 
increasing  turbulence  alone  (to  the  extreme  level  of  u’/S 
L  equal 
to  124)  does  not  create  broken  ﬂamelets,  for  the  case  of  prop- 
erly  back-supported  (piloted)  methane-air  ﬂames.  Thus,  it  is  be- 
lieved that for such ﬂames, the boundary of broken ﬂamelets does 
not  exist  on  a  Borghi  diagram.  However,  engine-like ﬂames  that 
contain recirculation zones and are not surrounded by hot prod- 
ucts are likely to have cool gas mixed with products and thus can 
be poorly back-supported. To incorporate a broken ﬂamelet regime 
into the Borghi diagram, it is suggested that additional axes should 
be added to account for back-support and steady-state strain rate. 
For this reason, ﬂames at Ka T,P > 100 should not be assumed to be 
broken unless experimental or DNS evidence is provided. 

2.3. Distributed reactions – when do they occur? 

Distributed  reactions  have  been  investigated  in  the  past  [77–
91] and are deﬁned to be chemical reactions that extend over a 
considerable distance. This distance has not been agreed upon, but 
it typically exceeds 1 cm, which is about 25 laminar ﬂame thick- 
nesses.  For  example,  distributed  chemical  reactions  occur  in  the 
1-D  Princeton  plug-ﬂow  reactor  [ 77 ],  the  Jet  Stirred  Reactor  of 
LeCong, Dagaut et al. [78] and the ideal homogeneous charge com- 
pression ignition (HCCI) engine. Other examples are ﬂameless oxi- 
dation (FLOX) devices [90] that were investigated by Peters, Pitsch, 
Dally and colleagues [86-89] and a fuel jet surrounded by a co-ﬂow 
of heated air [2] . 

2 , CO 

Distributed reactions have been called by different names, such 
as  ﬂameless  oxidation,  mild  combustion  and  a  fast  ﬂow  reactor. 
These are essentially the same because they tend to occur if there 
are  suﬃcient  levels  of  preheat  and  dilution.  Reactants  often  are 
preheated  to  10 0 0–120 0 K,  which  is  near  or  above  the  ignition 
temperature, and the air stream is diluted with large amounts of 
inert gases (typically N 
2 O). The reactants are injected 
2  or H 
into a combustion chamber at a suﬃciently high velocities to pre- 
vent ﬂame anchoring. After  an ignition delay time, auto-ignition 
occurs. Because of the large amount of inert gas present, gas tem- 
perature rises by only a small amount due to heat release, such 
as from 1200 K to 1500 K, over a large distance of perhaps 10 cm. 
Over that distance the reactants slowly convert to products. The 
wall temperatures and reactant velocities must be suﬃciently large 
to  prevent ﬂame  anchoring.  Thus,  the  temperature  gradients  are 
made small enough so that the diffusion term in the energy bal- 
ance is negligible compared to the reaction term. Distributed reac- 
tions represent a convection-reaction balance with negligible dif- 
fusion. In contrast, in a ﬂame the diffusion term is signiﬁcant due 
to the large temperature gradients. 

Researchers  have  identiﬁed  two  types  of  distributed  combus- 
tion burners; they are called the premixed and non-premixed de- 
signs. In the premixed design, fuel is mixed with heated, diluted 
oxidizer  within  a  mixing  chamber.  Then  the  mixture  is  injected 
as a high-velocity premixed jet into a combustion chamber. The 
high velocities prevent ﬂame anchoring so auto-ignition occurs and 
is followed by distributed combustion. This premixed design was 
described by Wunning and Wunning [80] and others [ 86 , 87 ]. The 
most common non-premixed design is the heated co-ﬂow (Cabra) 
burner. A shear layer exists between a central jet of fuel and a co- 
ﬂow of oxidizer that is diluted with inert gases and has a tem- 
perature that exceeds the ignition temperature. Such burners are 
described in Refs. [ 88 , 89 ]. Auto-ignition has been shown to occur 
in the shear layer [2] , followed by distributed combustion. 

A regime diagram for distributed combustion has not yet been 
measured, but available data have been used to speculate that dis- 
tributed combustion occurs in the upper left region of the graph 
[83]  in  Fig.  13 .  The  vertical  axis  is  the  temperature  of  the  pre- 
heated reactants and the horizontal axis is the mole fraction of O 
2 
in the oxidizer stream, which is air that has been diluted with in- 
ert gases. Conditions in this upper left region are believed to occur 
in gas turbine combustors and HCCI engines due to rapid mixing 
of preheated reactants and products. 

Based on Fig. 13 , distributed reactions are more likely to occur 
if: (a) large turbulence levels and recirculation zones mix the re- 
actants with hot products, (b) the mixing causes a preheating of 
reactants  to  1200 K  which  is  above  to  the  ignition  temperature;

ﬂame. Downstream locations are likely to contain a large homoge- 
neous region containing hot water vapor that is partially dissoci- 
ated to form equilibrium levels of OH. Images of either chemilu- 
minescence or OH PLIF would appear to be homogeneous, but this 
does not prove that the primary chemical reactions are homoge- 
neous in space. In this example the mean temperature ﬁeld will be 
homogeneous but this does not indicate that the primary reaction 
regions are homogeneous. A diagnostic technique that does conclu- 
sively image the chemical reaction regions is the formaldehyde-OH 
PLIF overlap method. 

One prediction of when distributed reactions should occur was 
offered by Williams [6] , who suggested that an appropriate turbu- 
T ) should be less than unity. The spe- 
lent Damköhler number (Da 
ciﬁc deﬁnition of Da 
T has not been agreed upon due to the lack of 
experimental data. Since Damköhler number is the ratio of the re- 
action rate to the ﬂuid strain rate, at low Da 
T the large strain rates 
were predicted to break reaction layers into many small segments 
and form a nearly homogeneous combustion. Experimental efforts 
to achieve large-scale distributed combustion by raising the turbu- 
lence level alone (with no preheat or dilution) have not proven to 
be successful. Skiba et al. [30] reduced Da 
T to less than unity by 
L to a value of 246 in their Hi-Pilot burner, but they 
increasing u’/S 
did not preheat or dilute the reactants with inert gases. They only 
observed a few small (2–3 mm) pockets where reaction layers were 
rolled up and they saw no large-scale distributed reactions. Their 
work supports the predictions leading to Fig. 13 that preheat and 
dilution are necessary requirements. 

2.4. Variation of turbulence within the ﬂame brush 

In  both  the  experiments  and  DNS  research  referenced  above 
[ 12-16 , 20 , 21 , 30 , 39 ] the reaction layers were found to remain thin 
and  nearly  continuous,  even  when  Ka T,P  was  set  to  a  value  that 
exceeds ﬁve times the value of 100 that was predicted to lead to 
broken reactions. The large difference indicates that modiﬁcations 
are needed to the fundamental assumptions upon which the pre- 
dictions are based. One suggested explanation is that the turbu- 
lence level that reaches the reaction layer has been attenuated by 
the hot, viscous gas in the preheat layer, so that the reaction layer 
may experience little or no turbulence. Wabel et al. [29] investi- 
gated this idea but found that the turbulence level that approaches 
each  reaction  layer  was  not  signiﬁcantly  attenuated  through  the 
preheat  layers.  They  ﬁrst  recorded  simultaneous  PIV  and  CH 
2 O–
PLIF images in the Hi-Pilot burner. The CH 
2 O-PLIF signal rises at 
the upstream boundary of the preheat layer and rapidly decreases 
at the downstream boundary, where the reaction layer begins. In 
each PIV image, the gas velocities were recorded as well as the dis- 
tance ( η) from the PIV interrogation box to the reaction zone up- 
stream boundary. After recording several hundred images, an en- 
semble of velocities ( U, V ) was created that had the same value of 
the distance η. Each ensemble was averaged to obtain mean and 
r.m.s. values. 

Fig. 15 a displays their conditioned turbulence levels ( u’ x ) and 
( v’ r ) as a function of the distance ( η) from the instantaneous re- 
action layer. In Fig. 15 there is a vertical dashed line and vertical 
solid line. These mark the upstream and downstream boundaries 
of the average preheat zone. So, the values to the left of the ver- 
tical dashed line represent the turbulence in the reactants, while 
values to the right of the vertical solid line represent turbulence 
in the products. In between the two lines is the preheat layer that 
contains both reactants and products. Fig. 15 a indicates that the 
conditioned turbulence levels in the reactants remain nearly con- 
stant in the region upstream of the preheat zone (on the left of 
the  dashed  line),  and  they  remain  constant  in  the  preheat  zone 
(between the two vertical lines). These turbulence levels remain 
nearly constant in the reaction layer, which is the one millimeter

reduces the oxygen level and (d) high speed injection of the pre- 
heated reactants prevents ﬂame anchoring. Wunning and Wunning 
[80] argued that the time for fuel, air and products to mix should 
be less than the ignition delay time. They state that enough dilu- 
ents are needed to reduce the temperature rise due to combus- 
tion to less than the temperature of the preheated reactants. An 
early assessment of these ideas was reported by de Joannon et al. 
[79] . They used Chemkin computations to show that counter ﬂow 
ﬂames are broadened when the reactant side of the ﬂame is suﬃ- 
ciently preheated and diluted with inert gases. 

A more recent investigation of distributed combustion was con- 
ducted  by  Minamoto,  Cant  and  colleagues  at  the  University  of 
Cambridge [ 84 , 85 ]. Their DNS effort s considered methane-air re- 
actants that were initially set to a temperature of 1500 K and were 
diluted with inert gases to have a 4.8% O 
2 content. The domain is a 
small box containing extreme levels of turbulence. Their computed 
temperature ﬁeld and reaction zones appear in  Fig. 14 .  Some of 
the reaction regions are distributed and have an ellipsoidal shape 
while others are conﬁned to broad or thin ﬂamelets. In another 
DNS study, Aspden et al. [18] observed distributed reactions. They 
did not preheat or dilute their reactants, but instead increased the 
turbulence level to achieve a value of Ka T,P  that is 87 times the 
value  of  100  that  was  predicted  to  create  broken  ﬂamelets  [3] . 
Their distributed reactions were shown in Fig. 2 f and g. 

Measurements  of  properties  of  distributed  combustion  were 
made at RWTH Aachen using Rayleigh scattering and OH PLIF diag- 
nostics [86-89] . The Aachen ﬂameless burner had three concentric 
tubes for the inﬂows of methane and air and the outﬂow of hot 
products. The fuel and air streams were forced to mix at high ve- 
locity before injection into a swirl ﬂame. To preheat the reactants, 
the hot exhaust gases recirculated back and were forced to ﬂow 
out through an outer concentric tube that surrounded the incom- 
ing fuel and air. The walls were ﬁre brick that reached a tempera- 
ture of 1275 K. Flameless oxidation was reported to occur when the 
reactants were preheated to 1073 K. Thermocouples indicated that 
mean gas temperature rose only 250 K over a 30 cm distance. This 
gradual temperature rise and the small ﬁnal temperature value led 
to  a  signiﬁcant  reduction  in  nitric  oxide  emissions.  Later,  a  full 
scale  FLOX  (ﬂameless  oxidation)  burner  was  designed  and  oper- 
ated within a stationary gas turbine combustor [90] by researchers 
at DLR Stuttgart and Siemens. 

A problem that arises is how to prove that the combustion is 
distributed. Convincing proof requires that the chemical reaction 
regions be imaged and be shown to extend over several centime- 
ters in space. Previous evidence was based on OH PLIF alone or 
chemiluminescence  from  excited  OH,  but  it  is  less  than  conclu- 
sive. For example, consider the case of a thin premixed laminar ﬂat

region to the right of η = 0. Therefore, the reaction layers and the 
preheat layers are subjected to the same level of turbulence as that 
of  the  approaching reactants.  Fig.  15 b indicates  that  conditioned 
integral scales ( L x ) increase within the preheat zone by about 50%. 
This suggests that smaller eddies are destroyed in the preheat zone 
but larger eddies are not. The mean velocities in Fig. 15 c are seen 
to decrease in the product region (on the right) because the pi- 
lot gas velocity is less than that of the main ﬂame products. These 
ﬁndings are consistent with DNS results of Aspden et al. [91] who 
held the viscosity of the gas constant throughout the preheat lay- 
ers. In a second run, they allowed the viscosity to rise to realistic 
values as the gas temperature rises. By comparing the two runs 
they concluded that an increase in viscosity through his preheat 
layers did not signiﬁcantly reduce the turbulence levels. 

3. Does turbulence alter the state relations that describe 
chemistry? 

DNS has been especially helpful in quantifying the chemistry 
that occurs within turbulent ﬂames, because it provides informa- 
tion about species mass fractions and certain reaction rates that 
cannot be measured. To determine if a simulation contains an ad- 
equate sub-model of the chemical kinetics, the typical ﬁrst step is 
to compare computed mean mass fraction proﬁles with measured 
proﬁles. Wang et al. [12-17] found satisfactory agreement between 
their DNS proﬁles and measurements in the Lund LUPJ jet burner. 
They compared the following properties: relative mean concentra- 
tions of formaldehyde and OH, mean temperature and gas velocity, 
ﬂame surface density and PDFs of ﬂame-front curvature. 

3.1. Comparisons of conditional mean proﬁles to laminar state 
relations 

Conditional  mean  proﬁles  offer  a  higher-level  way  to  com- 
pare experiments, DNS and LES, than by simply comparing mean 
concentration proﬁles. The conditional mean proﬁle is sometimes 
called a “state relation” or a manifold. In an experiment for exam- 
ple, the formaldehyde mass fraction and temperature can be mea- 
sured simultaneously at many times and at many locations, and a 
scatter plot is constructed of the instantaneous mass fraction ver- 
sus  instantaneous  gas  temperature.  The  conditional  mean  is  the 
smooth curve that passes through the center of the scattered data. 
The center of the scattered data is deﬁned to be the average value 
within a small range of gas temperatures. 

When state relations do deviate from the laminar case, one rea- 
son can be differential diffusion. For example, for lean hydrogen- 
air  reactants,  the  diffusion  of  H 
2  and  H  is  likely  to  exceed  that 
of other species in the laminar case, but this difference may dis- 
appear at extreme turbulence levels. If so, the state relations for 
2 or H in the turbulent case can differ from the laminar case. If 
H 
a ﬂamelet has been broadened, its state relation may continue to 
be similar to a laminar ﬂame, as is shown below. If so, ﬂamelet 
modelling assumptions remain valid. However, if the reaction re- 
gion becomes distributed in space, and is no longer a “layer” (i.e., 
gradients in one direction are not larger than in the other two di- 
rections) than deviations from the ﬂamelet state relations are ex- 
pected to occur. This is because the state relations are solutions 
to the ﬂamelet equation, which is a reaction-diffusion balance that 
has no convection terms. Gas diffusivity is important in the analy- 
sis and it appears in the deﬁnition of the governing parameter: the

Poludnenko and Oran [ 21 , 22 ], and Nilsson et al. [27] . Fig. 16 shows 
results of Zhou et al.; the white dashed line in Fig. 16 a is the con- 
ditional mean of the OH temperature corrected PLIF signal; it is 
compared to the solid white line, which is the corresponding OH 
proﬁle they measured in a laminar ﬂame. The dashed line (turbu- 
lent case) lies to the left of the solid line (laminar case). Thus OH 
exists at lower temperatures in the turbulent case than in the lam- 
inar case. Similar deviations occur at x/d = 25, as is seen in Fig. 16 b. 
An unexpectedly large amount of OH occurs in the low tempera- 
tures range from 900 K to 1400 K that is indicated by the arrow. 
Zhou et al. ﬁnd that this unexpected OH at low temperatures tends 
to  increase  as  the  jet  velocity  was  increased.  They  suggest  that 
eddies may transport H radicals to lower temperature regions to 
augment the reactions between H and O 
2 that create OH. Another 
study that reported unexpectedly large amounts of OH is that of 
Aspden et al. [19] . 

Fig. 16 c and d show that CH 

2 O exists over a wide range of tem- 
peratures in the experiment of Zhou et al. It is a stable interme- 
diate that is formed at high temperatures and diffuses upstream 
into the low temperature preheat zone. Therefore, a rise in the pro- 
ﬁles in Fig. 16 c can either be due to reactions that create CH 
2 O, or 
be due to diffusion. Zhou et al. note that their conditional mean 
(dashed white line) in Fig. 16 c displays large deviations from their 
measured laminar proﬁle (solid white line) at the downstream lo- 
cation  x/d = 30.  However,  at  the  upstream  location  x/d = 10  (see 
Fig. 16 d), the deviations are smaller. It can be concluded that the 
solid and dashed white curves in Fig. 16 show some level of dis- 
agreement, but the disagreement may not be large enough to in- 
validate ﬂamelet modeling assumptions.

nar ﬂames, respectively. The computed concentrations were con- 
verted to normalized LIF signal levels by applying the appropriate 
Boltzmann  and  collisional  quenching  factors.  It  is  apparent  from

scalar dissipation rate. A distributed reaction, in contrast, is deﬁned 
to be a reaction-convection balance, for which the diffusion terms 
are relatively small, so the use of the ﬂamelet equation is expected 
to be no longer appropriate. To better understand the limits of the 
modeling approach, measurements of state relations are needed for 
both ﬂamelet conditions and for distributed reaction conditions. 

Measurements of conditional mean proﬁles, for extreme levels 
of  turbulence,  have  been  made  by  Zhou  et  al.  [39] ,  Skiba  et  al. 
[33] and Dunn et al. [35] . In addition, DNS computations of con- 
ditional means are found in Wang et al. [14] , Aspden et al. [18] ,

as the axial distance from the burner increases the probability of 
encountering CH 
2 O exhibits a stark drop at low progress variables 
(i.e. below 0.2). Similar trends were observed by Zhou et al. [39- 
42] and Wang et al. [12] and it highlights the need to properly ac- 
count for the transport of preheated ﬂuid from the base to the tip 
of the ﬂame. Skiba et al. reported additional conditional mean pro- 
ﬁles for lower turbulence levels, and they also agree with laminar 
ﬂame state relations, in a manner similar to Fig. 17 . 

Dunn  et  al.  [35]  reported  conditional  mean  proﬁles  of  heat 
release  rate  in  their  PPJB  experiment  that  are  the  solid  lines  in 
Fig. 18 . They argue that their measured values of the product of 
CO and OH LIF signals are reasonable markers of heat release rates. 
The role of strain rate was explored by increasing the jet velocity. 
Extinction was observed at a location near x/d = 30, and this ex- 
tinction region exhibited a reduction in heat release rate. 

To  summarize  the  experimental  results  in  Figs.  16-18 ,  there 
is reasonable agreement between the measured conditional mean 
proﬁles and those from the laminar ﬂame computations. Such re- 
sults tend to validate the use of ﬂamelet models, even for extreme 
levels  of  turbulence,  at  least  for  the  piloted  Bunsen  and  jet  ge- 
ometries with no preheat. However, the jet ﬂame conditional mean 
proﬁles of Zhou et al. in Fig. 16 display somewhat larger deviations 
from the laminar case than the Bunsen data in Fig. 17 . A possible 
reason is that the reaction layer in their shorter LUPJ jet ﬂame con- 
stantly resides within a strong shear layer which is not present in 
the Bunsen case. 

Several DNS studies also have reported conditional mean pro- 
ﬁles at extreme turbulence levels. The upper plots in Fig. 19 are 
conditional mean proﬁles of Wang et al. [15] while the lower plots 
represent  measurements  in  LUPJ  burner  at  a  jet  exit  velocity  of 
110 m/s. Fig. 20 displays more of their DNS results, but for a larger 
jet exit velocity of 180 m/s. Wang et al. conclude that there is rea- 
sonable agreement between their computed mean proﬁles of sev- 
eral quantities and the Lund experiment. They state that their con- 
ditional mean proﬁles of heat release rate, that are seen in Fig. 20 a 
“agree well with laminar proﬁles”. To make their comparisons, they 
calculated laminar ﬂamelet state relations for a unity Lewis num- 
ber and for a strain rate that approximates the mean strain rate 
in the turbulent jet case. They note that Fig. 20 b and c show that 
2 O mass fraction is under predicted by the ﬂamelet curve 
“the CH 
at  x/d = 32  while  the  H 
2  mass  fraction  is  over  predicted  by  the 
ﬂamelet curve at x/d = 8.” Wang et al. note that their DNS results 
help explain the contributions of several key elementary reactions 
to the heat release rate.

Fig. 20 shows how the chemistry of a secondary reaction layer 
involving CO/H 
2 oxidation differs from that of the primary reaction 
layer. Wang et al. explain that secondary reactions are suppressed 
in the near-ﬁeld due to high strain rates, and are enhanced down- 
stream in the jet as CO, H 
2 generated upstream are 
advected downstream. Additionally, they note that effects of strain 
rate most likely depend on the fact that they use a pilot ﬂame to 
surround their jet ﬂame with hot products, since the equivalence 
ratio of the main jet differs from that of the pilot.

Aspden et al. [18-20] simulated lean hydrogen-air ﬂames in a 
box.  The  solid  black  lines  in  Fig.  21 a  and  b  are  the  conditional 
means  of  the  mole  fraction  of  the  hydrogen  fuel.  Ka T,P  was  10 
and 1562, respectively. The ﬁgure shows signiﬁcant deviations from 
the  laminar  ﬂame  proﬁle  for  both  cases.  The  authors  attribute 
the deviations to differential diffusion of hydrogen atoms and H 
2 
molecules that occurs in the laminar case but is not so pronounced 
in the turbulent case. Fig. 21 b shows that if the Ka T,P is raised from 
10 to 1562 the conditional means (solid lines) in Fig. 21 a and b re- 
main nearly identical but they do not agree with the laminar pro- 
ﬁle. 

Fig. 22 illustrates conditional mean proﬁles for Ka T,P  equal to 
8767, which is the highest value of Ka T,P reported to date. Aspden 
et al. [18] achieved this value in their DNS by adding a large forc- 
ing term to the momentum equation while maintaining an integral 
scale near 1 mm. Their conditions lead to insight about the theo- 
retical limit of extremely large strain rates, even though these con- 
ditions have not yet been achieved in any experiment. In Section 
2 Fig. 2 f and g showed that their small, strong eddies create a thick 
ﬂame brush in which ﬂamelets are replaced by distributed reac-

no ﬂamelets were seen in Fig. 2 f above, the proﬁle of heat release 
rate (the black line) in Fig. 22 a does not deviate signiﬁcantly from 
two laminar proﬁles. 

For one laminar proﬁle (the blue line in Fig. 22 ) all diffusivities 
were set to that of nitrogen so Lewis number is unity. For the other 
laminar proﬁle (the red line) all diffusivities were set to their real- 
istic values. Thus, Fig. 22 a indicates that differential diffusion does 
not affect proﬁles of heat release rate at Ka T,P = 8767 and the state 
relation does not seem to change as reactions become distributed.

For the case of distributed reactions, Fig. 23 shows DNS results 
of Minamoto et al. [ 84 , 85 ]. Methane-air reactants were preheated 
to 1500 K and diluted with inerts to lower the O 
2  mole fraction 
in  oxidizer  to  4.8%.  The  structure  of  their  reaction  regions  were 
shown in Fig. 14 . In Fig. 23 the conditional mean proﬁles of three 
species all show large deviations from the laminar ﬂame solution 
(dashed lines). The grey regions indicate a large amount of scatter 
in the data. Minamoto et al. attribute the scatter to the inhomo- 
geneity in the inﬂowing mixture caused by pockets of exhaust and 
fresh mixtures. The large differences between conditional means 
and laminar ﬂame proﬁles is not surprising, since Fig. 14 indicated 
that there are few ﬂamelets present. To develop LES models of dis- 
tributed combustion, Fig. 23 indicates that the ﬂamelet approach 
needs  to  be  replaced  or  modiﬁed.  The  ﬂamelet  equation  that  is 
solved to obtain the laminar ﬂame proﬁles in Fig. 23 has only re- 
action and diffusion terms, while distributed reactions are believed 
to be governed by a reaction-convection balance, with small diffu- 
sion terms. The chemical kinetics mechanism used in models may 
need to be modiﬁed when the reactant temperature exceeds the 
ignition temperature, as it does in Ref. [84] . 

It  can  be  concluded  that  experimental  and  DNS  conditional 
mean proﬁles, obtained for extreme turbulence levels and with no 
preheat or dilution, are in good agreement with laminar proﬁles 
for methane and hydrogen fuels. A caveat is that for lean hydrogen 
cases, this statement is true only if the Lewis number of the lami- 
nar ﬂame computations is set to unity, but this presents no prob- 
lem for LES ﬂamelet modelers. Thus the experiments and DNS sup- 
port the use of ﬂamelet models for the conditions investigated. For 
the case of distributed combustion caused by preheating and dilu- 
tion, only a few studies have reported conditional mean proﬁles. 
Not  surprisingly,  these  proﬁles  do  not  agree  with  laminar  ﬂame 
state relations, so new state relations for distributed combustion 
appear to be needed. 

3.2. Complex fuels – DNS and experiments 

While Section 3.1 shows that the state relations for simple fuels 
(such as methane and hydrogen) agree with laminar ﬂame compu- 
tations (if Lewis number is set to unity). More research is needed 
before  any  similar  statement  can  be  made  about  complex  fuels. 
For  such  research, DNS is especially important because state  re- 
lations are diﬃcult to measure when complex fuels are burned, as 
discussed in Section 5.2 . To apply DNS or LES to the combustion 
of complex fuels, validated reaction mechanisms ﬁrst are required. 
The many components of Jet-A and JP-8 fuels are listed by Edwards 
[92] . The JetSurF 1.0 mechanism was developed [93] to compute 
the  pyrolysis  and  oxidation  kinetics  of  normal  alkanes  up  to  n- 
dodecane. It contains 194 species and 1459 reactions and runs us- 
ing the CHEMKIN code. The base model is USC-MechII, which has 
been validated by comparing results to measurements of laminar 
ﬂame speeds, ignition delay times behind shock waves, and species 
proﬁles in  ﬂow  reactors  and  burner  stabilized ﬂames  [ 94 , 95 ].  In 
order  to  add  the  kinetics  of  complex  fuels  to  DNS,  a  reduced- 
order  version  of  JetSurF  is  required.  Gao  and  Co-authors  [ 96 , 97 ] 
describe a hybrid chemistry model, called HyChem, that was devel- 
oped by Prof. Hai Wang and many collaborators. It applies to situ- 
ations when a complex fuel thermally decomposes to form sim- 
ple  foundational  fuels  before  any  signiﬁcant  oxidation  reactions 
occur. Thus, HyChem decouples fuel pyrolysis/decomposition from 
the oxidation of intermediates. Thermal decomposition processes 
are modeled by seven lumped reaction steps for which the reac- 
tion rate coeﬃcients have been measured. Then the oxidation of 
the simple foundational fuels are computed using detailed chem- 
istry. Foundational fuels include: butene, propene, ethylene, acety- 
lene, ethane, methane, and hydrogen. HyChem has been reduced 
to  24  species  and  93  reactions  and  it  is  capable  of  predicting 
a  wide  range  of  combustion  properties,  including  ignition  delay 
times,  laminar  ﬂame  speeds  and  non-premixed  ﬂame  extinction 
strain rates. 

Gao  et  al.  [96]  demonstrated  that  DNS  now  can  be  run  at 
reasonable computational cost with HyChem chemistry (with 24 
species)  to  simulate  a  butane-air  turbulent  premixed  ﬂame  in  a 
box. Fig. 24 a illustrates wrinkled reaction layers and Fig. 24 b shows 
how instantaneous butane mass fractions are distributed about the 
laminar ﬂame solution (red line). The butane fuel breaks down into 
ethylene and propene, whose proﬁles are seen in Fig. 24 b. Shown 
are 2-D DNS results, but extending the work to 3-D presents no 
technical  barriers.  Details  of  the  HyChem  mechanism  have  been 
described by Wang et al. [97] . 

Aspden et al. [98] performed DNS of n-dodecane fuel and air 
subjected to high Karlovitz number turbulence within a box, and 
included detailed chemistry of 56 species. Fig. 25 shows the condi- 
tional mean proﬁles of some intermediate species, including hex-

ane, butene, and propene. The conditional mean proﬁle is the black 
line,  while  the  upper  red  and  lower  blue  lines  were  computed 
from  laminar  ﬂame  simulations  with  non-unity  and  unity  Lewis 
numbers, respectively. Aspden et al. found that n-dodecane has a 
lower turbulent burning velocity than methane. Differences were 
attributed  to  stretch  effects  because  lean  dodecane  has  Le  >  1, 
while for lean methane Le < 1. Lewis number effects were found to 
suppress wrinkling and to lead to a negative correlation between 
local burning speed and curvature, as is predicted by the theory of 
ﬂame stretch [11] . 

Aspden et al. stated that because fuel decomposition and oxida- 
tion occur in cooler regions, the distribution of fuel fragments were 
found to be susceptible to the level of turbulence. They concluded 
that the basic oxidation pathway of fuel fragments is largely un- 
affected by turbulence, but concentrations of certain species were 
considerably reduced from laminar ﬂame values. They found that 
for their methane cases the peak consumption rates of fuel and 
oxygen occur at roughly the same temperature. However, dodecane 
is distinctly different because its peak consumption rate occurs at 
2  consumption rate occurs 
around 1200 K whereas the peak in O 
near 1460 K. Furthermore, unlike methane, the peak rate of con- 
sumption for each species was found to be dramatically smaller 
for the turbulent case relative to the laminar ﬂame. The response

to turbulence is distinctly different than the corresponding unity 
Lewis  number  laminar  ﬂame  as  indicated  by  the  blue  curve  in 
Fig. 25 . This suggests that the turbulence is beginning to disrupt 
the chemistry in the cool portion of the ﬂame where the dodecane 
is being consumed. One other paper that describes complex chem- 
istry was that of Minamoto and Chen [99] who selected their fuel 
to be dimethyl-ether (DME). 

Fig. 26 contains results of the DNS study of premixed heptane 
and  air  conducted  by  Savard  and  Blanquart  [ 23 , 24 ];  some  addi- 
tional results were reported by Lapoint and Blanquart [26] . In the 
latter work two different kinetics mechanisms were compared: Jet- 
SurF and CalTechMech, which contained 172 species. All three pa- 
pers  reported  evidence  that  the  state  relations  were  not  signif- 
icantly  altered  by  turbulence,  but  that  Lewis  number  and  ﬂame 
stretch effects remained important. In Ref. [26] the turbulent burn- 
ing velocities of heptane-air cases were found to differ from those 
of methane, but the differences were explained by the difference in 
Lewis numbers. That is, it was found that when Lewis number was 
set to unity, the authors reported that “turbulence had a limited 
effect”. In Ref erence [23] fuel consum ption rates and ﬂame speeds 
were found to be highly correlated with the local ﬂame curvature, 
indicating that stretch rate remained important. 

A number of researchers have conducted experimental studies 
of the premixed turbulent combustion of complex fuels such as n- 
dodecane and Jet-A. Historically, the ﬁrst approach has been to de- 
termine if measurements could be collapsed to a single curve us- 
ing the Lewis number ( Le ). Le is deﬁned to be the thermal diffusiv- 
ity of the reactant mixture, divided by the mass diffusivity of the

to a single curve by using the parameter ( u’ / S 
points that they plotted did follow a general trend, in that S 
T does 
increase as Le decreases. However, their attempt to collapse data 
to a single curve was not successful. It is noted that Lewis number 
depends only on the properties of the unburned fuel and air, but 
the  gas  entering  the  reaction  zone  contains  mostly  intermediate 
species and not much unreacted fuel. For this reason, there was 
an effort [11] to replace Lewis number with the Markstein num- 
ber (Ma). Ma is determined from the relation that equates S 
L0 
to (1 - Ka Ma ), where S 
L0  is the laminar burning velocity of a 
strained laminar ﬂame, normalized by it unstrained value, and Ka 
is the Karlovitz number, which is a non-dimensional strain rate. 
The idea is that if two fuels have different Lewis numbers, but if 
they decompose to form similar intermediate species, their prop- 
erties may be similar. However, a review of the literature indicates 
that there have been no successful attempts to collapse turbulent 
burning velocity data to a single curve using the Markstein num- 
ber.

A  long-standing  idea  is  that  differential  diffusion  disappears 
when the turbulent diffusivity greatly exceeds the molecular dif- 
fusivity. This idea has been shown to be approximately valid for 
several fuels but for lean hydrogen-air reactants it has been dif- 
ﬁcult to achieve the limit where differential diffusion disappears. 
The ﬁrst evidence that differential diffusion effects do not disap- 
pear at moderate turbulence levels for hydrogen-air reactants was 
reported by Wu et al. [101] in 1990. Their lean cases ( Le < 1) had 
a measured turbulent burning velocity that was three times that 
of  their  rich  cases  ( Le  >  1),  even  though  care  was  taken  to  in- 
sure that turbulence levels, integral scales, and S 
L0 were the same 
for both cases. Signiﬁcantly more ﬂame wrinkling was observed in 
the lean case than in the rich case, which agrees with the theory 
of ﬂame stretch. Later DNS work [ 102 , 103 ] showed that differen- 
tial  diffusion effects persist  for  lean hydrogen-air reactants.  DNS 
of Aspden et al. [ 19 , 20 ] indicate that even for very large Ka T,P  of 
400 and 1562, differential diffusion effects are weakened but do 
not entirely disappear for their lean hydrogen-air reactants. Bulges 
in their ﬂame surface that have positive curvature were found to 
propagate faster than regions having negative curvature; they at- 
tributed the difference to differential diffusion. When Aspden et al. 
raised Ka T,P to 8767 [18] their computed state relations agreed with 
laminar values. At these extreme conditions differential diffusion 
may not disappear completely, but its effects appear to be dimin- 
ished when the turbulent diffusivity greatly exceeds the molecular 
diffusivity. 

Recent experiments have recorded turbulent burning velocities 
for  complex  fuels,  including  C 
8  n-alkanes.  Carobone  et  al. 
4  to  C 
[104]  and  colleagues  in  the  group  of  Prof.  Fokion  Egolfopoulos 
[ 105 , 106 ] considered premixed, pre-vaporized jet ﬂames of C1 to 
C8 hydrocarbons. They measured the heights of jet ﬂames, which 
are inversely proportional to the effective turbulent burning veloc- 
ities. They found that “the dependence of the ﬂame height on the 
laminar ﬂame speed was nearly the same for all of the fuels at a 
ﬁxed Reynolds number”. This suggests that turbulence does not al- 
ter the state relations but only alters the turbulent burning velocity 
because it increases the diffusion of heat. Their methane-air ﬂames 
were  more  resistant  to  quenching  than  the  higher  hydrocarbon 
cases, resulting in longer ﬂame lengths. Wu et al. [107] measured 
the turbulent burning velocities of spherical outward-propagating 
8  n-alkane  ﬂames  in  a  constant  pressure  chamber.  They 
C 
found that for stoichiometric and rich mixtures (near-unity Le, or 
Le < 1), the normalized turbulent ﬂame speeds for the different 
fuels were almost the same. Their explanation is that a number of 
large chain n-alkanes break down to the same set of intermediate 
species before entering the reaction zone.

Some  recent  progress  has  been  made  in  applying  laser  di- 
agnostics  to  image  the  turbulent  combustion  of  preheated  com- 
plex  fuels  such  as  dodecane,  heptane  and  Jet-A.  Windom  et  al. 
[108] and Won et al. [109] operated their Reaction Assisted Tur- 
bulent  Slot  (RATS)  burner  on  n-heptane-air  reactants  that  were 
preheated to 700 K. OH and CH 
2 O PLIF diagnostics were applied. 
They  conclude  that  their  n-heptane  ﬂames  exhibit  strong  low- 
temperature  chemistry  (cool  ﬂame)  behavior.  Four  regimes  were 
identiﬁed:  a  conventional  chemically-frozen-ﬂow  regime,  a  low- 
temperature  ignition  regime,  a  transitional  regime  (between  the 
low to high temperature-ignition regimes) and a high-temperature 
ignition regime. The regime they observed depended on a new pa- 
rameter that the authors deﬁne to be the low-temperature reac- 
tivity. The reactants are deﬁned to have a larger reactivity if they 
are given an increased preheat temperature or an increased con- 
centration of intermediates, such as formaldehyde. Windom et al. 
argue  that  increased  intermediates  are  caused  by  the  low  tem- 
perature chemistry that occurs between the time when reactants 
are  preheated  to  the  time  that  they  enter  the  ﬂame.  This  time 
was called the low temperature chemistry residence time. Turbu- 
lent burning velocities in two of the regimes were recorded as the 
level of low-temperature reactivity was varied. Won et al. argue 
that with complex fuels, such as heptane, the conventional descrip- 
tion of regimes on a Borghi diagram is no longer appropriate. The 
only parameter that describes the chemistry on a Borghi diagram, 
and in many premixed combustion theories, is the laminar burn- 
ing velocity (which sets the laminar ﬂame thickness). References 
[ 108 , 109 ]  provide  evidence  that  the  preheating  of  complex  fuels 
introduces new chemistry parameters, such as the reactivity of the 
reactants, that should be included in theories and analysis. 

It  can  be  concluded  from  the  papers  discussed  in  Section 
3.1 that extreme turbulence, with no preheat, does not signiﬁcantly 
alter  the  state  relations  for  methane-air  reactants.  For  dodecane 
and  heptane  fuels,  the  evidence  is  sparse  but  turbulent  burning 
velocities, normalized by laminar ﬂame speeds, do not seem to de- 
pend heavily on fuel type, for the same turbulence levels and no 
preheat. However, Won et al. [109] did note that when complex hy- 
drocarbon fuel-air mixtures are preheated, two reaction layers are 
formed; one is associated with low temperature (cool) reactions 
and  the  other  with  high  temperature  reactions.  Differential  dif- 
fusion does not disappear for lean-hydrogen-air reactants in DNS 
studies except for a few studies that achieved very large Ka 
T,P . For 
heptane-air reactants, some ﬂame stretch effects do persist at ex- 
treme turbulence levels. 

4. Are Damköhler’s predictions about turbulent burning 
velocity conﬁrmed? 

In  1940,  Damköhler  suggested  the  following  two  hypotheses 

[110] that are described in Refs. [ 4 , 72 ]. 

a) If all of the turbulent eddies upstream of a premixed ﬂame are 
larger than the laminar ﬂame thickness then their only effect 
is to stretch and wrinkle the ﬂame and increase its total sur- 
face area. In this case the turbulent burning velocity ( S 
T ), when 
L ), should equal the ratio of 
normalized by the laminar value ( S 
the area of the wrinkled ﬂame front to the area of a smooth 
curve drawn through the center of the ﬂame brush. Based on 
this idea, Shchelkin [ 3 , 4 , 72 ] predicted that for low levels of tur- 
bulence:

where c 
1 is an empirical constant. Derivation of Eq. (7) appears 
in Lewis and von Elbe [ 4 , p. 414], Peters [ 3 , p. 123], Kuo and 
Acharya [ 72 , p. 292]. Shchelkin considering an ideal vortex that

crosses a laminar ﬂame. The rotational velocity of the eddy cre- 
ates  a  wrinkle  that  he  argued  has  the  approximate  shape  of 
a cone on each side of the eddy. The height of the cone was 
shown to be proportional to u ’. S 
L  was assumed to equal 
the area of the curved surface of the cone, divided by the area 
of the base of the cone. The ratio of these two areas leads to 
Eq. (7) . 

T  / S 

b) Damhöhler’s second hypothesis was that if all of the upstream 
eddies are smaller than the laminar ﬂame thickness, then their 
only inﬂuence is to increase the diffusivity from the molecular 
diffusivity ( D ) to the new value of ( D + D 
T ), where D 
T  is the 
turbulent diffusivity. The precise value of D 
T was not speciﬁed 
by Damhöhler but he assumed that it is proportional to ( u’ L x ). 

Since the laminar ﬂame speed is known to be proportional to 
D 1/2 [ 4 , 72 ] it was suggested that turbulent burning velocity should 
be proportional to ( D + D T ) 1/2 . Thus, it was predicted that:

extreme turbulence ( u’/S L up to 163). Reprinted with permission of Elsevier. 

Additionally, since the thickness of a laminar ﬂame is propor- 
tional to D 1/2 , it was theorized that turbulent preheat layer thick- 
ness also should be proportional to ( D + D T ) 1/2 . So, if the turbu- 
lence is suﬃciently large such that Eq. (8) becomes valid, the pre- 
heat layers should become broadened. 

As a consequence of these ideas, it has been predicted that the 

following should occur. 

b) S 

a) The  curve  of  S 

T  versus  u ’  initially  should  be  nearly  linear 
( Eq. (7) ) and it should bend as u ’ increases, due to the square 
root dependence in Eq. (8) . 
T  should continue to increase with u’ , even if the ﬂame sur- 
face area no longer increases. This is because each broadened 
ﬂamelet can propagate faster than a laminar ﬂamelet as a re- 
sult of the increased internal diffusion of heat to the reactants.

been veriﬁed by many experiments, including those of Yuen and 
Gülder [ 61 , 63 ], Kido et al. [111] and Filatyev et al. [112] . For the

ported the ﬁrst measurements of turbulent burning velocity. Their 
results appear in Fig. 27 . Note that u’/S

very large value of 163. S

speed, which is:

tively. A is the area of the time-averaged OH contour. The curves 
in Fig. 27 display bending and continues to rise as u’/S 
L increases 
up to 163. 

Models  and  DNS  often  are  assessed  by  comparing  results  to 
only  one  experimental  condition;  it  is  recommended  instead  to 
compare model and DNS results to Eq. (8) for a range of turbu- 
lence levels. Eq. (8) does represent the experimental Bunsen ﬂame 
results of Yuen and Gülder [ 61 , 63 ], who argued that bending re- 
sults when turbulent diffusivity replaces molecular diffusivity. Sim- 
ilar conclusions were reached by Lee and Huh [113] and others [1] . 
Several  theoretical  explanations  have  been  offered  to  explain 
the “bending” of the curves in Fig. 27 , which are have shape that 
is similar to those of Yuen and Gülder [61] , Kido et al. [111] and 

Filatyev et al. [112] . One idea is the turbulent diffusivity scaling of 
Damkohler ( Eq. (8) ) that predicts a non-linear relation between S 
T 
and u ’; Peters [114] employed the turbulent diffusivity idea when 
he solved the G-equation and added a nonlinear term to the lo- 
cal wave propagation speed that is similar to Eq. (8) . His resulting 
model  automatically  predicts  a  bending  trend.  Chakraborti  et  al. 
[115] considered turbulent diffusion and present an analysis that 
identiﬁes the conditions under which Damköhler’s hypothesis re- 
mains valid. 

A  different  explanation  of  the  bending  of  the  curves  in 
Fig. 27 was suggested by Nivarti et al. [116,117] . They argued that 
there is an “inhibited growth of ﬂame surface area in high inten- 
sity turbulence.” In their DNS results they observed that the merg- 
ing of ﬂamelets was rare, but there was a “reduced eﬃciency of 
eddies to strain the ﬂame as turbulence intensity increases.” Ni- 
varti and Cant considered a range of eddy scales that ﬁt within 
the preheat layer and thus could contribute to the turbulent diffu- 
sivity. Their analysis leads to the conclusion that turbulent burning 
velocity should scale as Karlovitz number raised to the 1/3 power. 
Their scaling predicts that increasing the integral scale tends to re- 
duce the turbulent burning velocity, but this predicted trend does 
not agree with Eq. (8) . 

A third explanation is based on the assumption that the rate 
of ﬂamelet merging is proportional to the square of the ﬂame sur- 
face density, as was discussed by Duclos et al. [118] . For extreme 
turbulence levels the rate of surface destruction due to merging 
was predicted to exceed the rate of creation due to stretch. A re- 
lated idea is that ﬂamelets cannot become too densely-packed due 
to gas expansion. Product gases always have a velocity that is di- 
rected away from the reaction layers, and this gas velocity could 
set a minimum distance between wrinkled layers and thus put an 
upper limit on their surface area. The reaction layers in Fig. 6 c are 
the most densely-packed examples in the literature, but it is not 
known if even more densely-packed layers are possible. 

There  are  two  commonly-used  deﬁnitions  of  the  turbulent 
burning velocity; one is the global consumption speed that is de- 
ﬁned above by Eq. (9) . Another is based on the ﬂame surface den- 
sity (cid:8) and was derived by Bray and Cant [119] , it is:

lean  methane-air  ﬂames,  and  η is  the  direction  normal  to  the 
ﬂame brush. The right side of Eq. (10) is proportional to the area of

a wrinkled, thin ﬂame-front. It was assumed that each segment on 
the ﬂame-front propagates normal to itself at the stretched lam- 
inar ﬂame speed. The integral of (cid:8) d η is proportional to the to- 
tal ﬂame-front area. For intense turbulence, Yuen and Gülder [61] , 
Wabel  et  al.  [34]  and  others  have  shown  that  measured  values 
of  S 
T  obtained  using  Eq.  (10)  are  much  smaller  than  values  de- 
termined using Eq. (9) . There are several possible reasons for the 
difference. One reason is that when turbulence enters the preheat 
layer it increases the diffusivity and this should cause two things 
to happen: there should be a broadening of the preheat layers and 
the local propagation speed of each segment along the ﬂame front 
should increase to a value that exceeds the laminar value ( S 
L ). Ex- 
L ex- 
periments indicate that preheat broadening occurs when u’/S 
ceeds approximately 10. Thus, Eq. (10) should not be expected to 
remain valid because it is based on the assumption that each seg- 
ment propagates at S 

L . 

Lapointe  and  Blanquart  [26]  suggest  that  Eq.  (10)  should  be 
0 is no longer only a stretch factor, but it should 
modiﬁed so that I 
include  the  enhanced  local  propagation  speed  that  is  caused  by 
turbulent  diffusivity.  A  similar  attempt  to  model  the  increase  in 
the local propagation speed that is due to turbulent diffusivity was 
made  by  Peters  [114] .  He  added  a  relation  similar  to  Eq.  (8)  to 
force the ﬂame front to propagate at a speed that is larger than 
S 
L . This approach may be overly simplistic and there may be better 
ways to incorporate both surface area and turbulent diffusivity in 
the attempt to correlate turbulent burning velocities. Related work 
was  done  by  Nivarti  and  Cant  [28]  who  analyzed  their  DNS  re- 
sults and found that turbulent burning velocities determined using 
Eqs. (9) and (10) agreed. They denoted the right side of Eq. (10) to 
be the area ratio A 
L . Their ﬁnding is in contrast to the exper- 
iments [ 34 , 61 , 63 ]. The reason for the disagreement is not known, 
but the DNS considered an integral scale of 0.99 mm, whereas the 
experiments were conducted for integral scales up to forty times 
larger. 

T /A 

A second possible reason why Eq. (10) yields lower measured 
values of S 
T than Eq. (9) is that ﬂame surface density may not be 
measured accurately due to spatial resolution limitations. The size 
of the smallest ﬂame wrinkle is not known when the turbulence 
is  in  the  extreme  range.  One  problem  is  that  experiments  typi- 
cally only record 2-D values of (cid:8). DNS results have shown that 
measured 2-D values of (cid:8) should be multiplied by a factor that 
ranges from 1.15 to 1.30 in the attempt to estimate the 3-D value 
[ 54 , 55 , 120 , 121 ]. In addition, the spatial resolution of experiments 
is typically limited to 120–200 μm in the direction perpendicular 
to the laser sheet, which is the sheet thickness. The resolution in 
the other directions often is a similar value, due to the binning of 
the pixels of the camera and focusing limitations of the camera op- 
tics. This means that contributions to (cid:8) due ﬂame wrinkles having 
sizes below approximately 360–600 μm usually are not resolved. 

To  assess  the  resolution  issue,  Skiba  et  al.  [122]  spatially  av- 
eraged their recorded images. They ﬁrst achieved the best possi- 
ble resolution by collecting high signal-to-noise Rayleigh scatter- 
ing images in the range of extreme turbulence, after reducing the 
laser sheet thickness to 120 μm. Then they reduced the in-plane 
resolution  by  a  factor  of  six  by  spatially  averaging  the  recorded 
images. The upper curve in Fig. 28 a represents the best possible 
measurement of (cid:8) reported in Ref. [122] . Note that the values of 
u’/S 
L extend up to the very large value of 124. The vertical axis is 
the average value of the 2-D wrinkled ﬂame-front area, normal- 
ized by the area of a smooth curve that is ﬁt to the center of the 
ﬂame brush. The pixel size (i.e., the projected pixel size at the laser 
image plane) is 54 μm for the upper curve while lower curves cor- 
respond to a six-fold increase in pixel size to 330 μm. This loss of 
resolution is seen to reduce the measured ﬂame area by 33%. 

Fig. 28 b is an estimate of the true values expected when the 
pixel size is extrapolated to zero. The dashed lines extrapolate the 

results  to  large  values  of  (1/pixel  size).  The  lower  curve  is  ﬂat, 
showing that for moderate turbulence levels there is little bene- 
ﬁt  in  reducing  the  pixel  size  to  less  than  300  μm;  the  wrinkle 
scales were fully resolved for this pixel size. For the higher tur- 
bulence levels, doubling the resolution (1/pixel size) causes only a 
3.5% change in the area ratio. Such a minor change suggests that 
the wrinkle sizes are not smaller than the resolution of ∼120 μm. 
This wrinkle size is more than ten times the estimated Kolmogorov 
length scales which are ∼10 and ∼7 μm for the upper two curves 
in Fig. 27 b. Thus, it is concluded that the smallest wrinkles that 
contribute signiﬁcantly to ﬂame area are larger than ten times the 
Kolmogorov scale. For a typical spatial resolution of 200 μm and 
L ) of less than 25, the data in 
for a typical turbulence level ( u’/S 
Fig. 28 indicate that the true, fully resolved 2-D area ratio is be- 
tween 1.0 and 1.2 times the measured (under resolved) 2-D value. 
A different way to understand the role of the smallest wrinkles 
was demonstrated by the fractal analysis of Hawkes et al. [120] , 
Gülder [123] and Chatakonda et al. [124] . In Refs. [120 , 124 ], the 
fractal dimension and the inner cutoff limit were determined from 
DNS  results.  Fractal  dimension  was  found  to  varied  in  time  and 
it was signiﬁcantly smaller at both early and at late times during 
the ﬂame development. This could not be explained by temporal 
variations of the turbulence parameters. It was suggested that it is 
due to the ﬂame experiencing a different range of turbulent ﬂow 
scales  as  time  progresses.  The  inner  cut-off scale  was  extracted 
and was found to show a trend with time similar to that of the 
fractal dimension, which was not anticipated. It was shown that 
an alternative deﬁnition of a length scale that resolves a certain 
fraction of total ﬂame surface area was not strongly time-varying 
when it was normalized by the Kolmogorov microscale. The fractal 
dimension of their ﬂames varied between 2.6 and 2.7; this is sig- 
niﬁcantly higher than has been reported in previous studies, and 
was in agreement with theoretical ideas that they proposed. The 
fractal dimension was found to increase with increasing Karlovitz 
number, as expected. Their results support the idea that the 3-D 
fractal dimension is the 2-D value plus one. 

To  summarize  the  above  research,  the  turbulent  burning  ve- 
locities of Wabel et al. [34] in the extreme turbulence range for 
L  up  to  125  follow  similar  trend  as  those  reported  by  Yuen 
u ’/ S 
and Gülder [61] for u ’/ S 
L  up to 24. The bending of the curves in 
Fig.  27  is  attributed  to  eddies  broadening  the  preheat  layer  and 
increasing the turbulent diffusivity, but the bending may be aug- 
mented by other factors. The equation for turbulent burning veloc- 
ity that is based on ﬂame surface density ( Eq. (10) ) is based on the 
assumption that each ﬂame front segment propagates at the lami- 
T is assumed to be proportional to the 
nar burning velocity, thus S 
wrinkled area A 
T . Assessment of this assumption has led to con- 
ﬂicting conclusions, based on both DNS and experimental results 
in the range of extreme turbulence. 

4.1. Flame-ﬂame interactions that affect turbulent burning velocity 

When  turbulent  burning  velocities  are  measured,  usually  a 
spatially-averaged value of S 
T is reported. This value quantiﬁes the 
total mass ﬂowrates of reactants that are consumed, as was indi- 
cated by Eq. (9) . However, an interesting question is: What is the 
mechanism that allows some segments of a ﬂame brush to prop- 
agate much faster than other segments? For example, in a Bun- 
sen or jet ﬂame, the tip of the brush is nearly normal to the local 
mean velocity, and this local velocity can be much larger than the 
T at the tip 
spatially-averaged value of S 
must be signiﬁcantly larger than at other locations. This is despite 
the fact that the velocity ﬂuctuations (u’) at the tip are equal to 
(or less than) those at other locations. A previous assumption has 
been that each segment of a ﬂame brush is independent of other 
segments, so a segment propagates at a speed that only depends 

T . Thus, the local value of S

on the turbulence properties ( u’, L x ) just upstream of it. Both DNS 
and experiments now show that this idea is not accurate and that 
ﬂame-ﬂame interactions occur. 

For  example,  the  schematic  in  Fig.  29  indicates  that  when  a 
preheat layer is signiﬁcantly broadened it can create a channel of 
high temperature gas; the arrow on the left represents heat dif- 
fusing upstream and radially inward into the reactants. The arrow 
pointing upward indicates that this heat is convected upward to- 
ward the tip region of a Bunsen or a jet ﬂame. Thus, the tip region 
propagates into preheated reactants. The ﬂame brush near the tip 
is nearly  perpendicular to  the incident gas velocity, and the gas 
velocity incident on the tip may be as large as 60 to 100 m/s. So, 
the brush near the tip has a large propagation velocity, which is 
believed to be due to the preheating of the reactants by other seg- 
ments of the brush. This notion that the ﬂame tip is burning into 
preheated reactants also is supported by trends exhibited by the 
joint PDFs in Figs. 16–18 . That is, cases subjected to extreme turbu- 
lence possess little to no species at low progress variables ( c < 0.2) 
and/or temperatures ( T < 10 0 0 K) at regions approaching the ﬂame 
tip; this is evidence that the gases approaching the tip are not at 
room temperature but have been preheated.

near the tip of a jet ﬂame, forming broad preheated regions. Reprinted with per- 
mission of Elsevier. 

Flame-ﬂame interactions also were observed in the Lund jet ex- 
periment and the DNS of that experiment [14] . The small jet diam- 
eter creates high Karlovitz numbers, leading to signiﬁcant merging 
of the preheat zones and reaction zones, especially near the ﬂame 
tip.  This  is  revealed  in  the  instantaneous  contours  of  formalde- 
hyde, HO 
2 , and CO mass fractions shown in Fig. 30 . The species 
shown are good markers of the preheat zone. Merging of preheat 
zones  across  the  jet  is  seen  to  occur  at  x/d = 16.  A  consequence 
of  substantial  ﬂame-ﬂame  interaction  is  the  increase  in  preheat 
zone temperature and the generation of reactive stable intermedi- 
ate species such as H 
2 , which promote ﬂame prop- 
2 O, HO 
agation, particularly if the preheat temperature is suﬃciently high. 
Local ﬂame-ﬂame interaction and cross-talk from opposite sides of 
the jet are compounded by increased turbulent diffusion between 
the cold inlet reactants and the hot pilot product gases such that 
the preheat zone temperature increases from 300 K to over 1100 K 
by x/d = 24, creating a highly reactive environment, and enhanced 
propagation speeds.

5. Future challenges 

5.1. Roadmap to extend DNS to larger Reynolds numbers 

Currently,  DNS  has  been  extended  to  the  100  petascale  level 
(100 × 10 15 ﬂoating point operations per second) in order to nu- 
merically resolve and all of the scales of the turbulence and com- 
bustion. Wang et al. [13] were able to simulate a realistic (LUPJ) 
jet  geometry  at  an  impressive  Ka T,P  of  1400  at  upstream  jet  lo- 
cations and Re 
T  of 3840 at downstream locations. Their compar- 
isons to experimental data veriﬁed that the reduced methane-air 
chemistry and grid resolution were adequate. In the future time 
frame (2021–23) it will become feasible to perform DNS at larger 
Reynolds numbers, at higher pressures, with more complex fuels, 
and in more complicated geometries. One way to move forward is 
to use exascale computers (10 to 100 times 10 18 ﬂops), as reviewed 
in Refs. [ 2 , 125 ]. 

There has been a concerted effort in the US, Japan, China and 
Europe to deploy an exascale machine in the next 3–5 years; to do 
so DNS will need to be refactored to optimally utilize the hetero- 
geneous machines being built at the exascale. The extreme hetero- 
geneity  is  driven  largely  by  power  constraints  and  the  availabil- 
ity  of  low-power  commodity  computing  processors,  such  as  the 
GPUs (graphics processing units) and ARMs (advanced, reduced in- 
struction set machines) in our mobile devices. A signiﬁcant chal- 
lenge for domain scientists to effectively use exascale computing 
resources lies in programming these machines. The majority of to- 
day’s CFD codes rely on the message passing interface (MPI) pro- 
tocol [126] for performing internode communication, e.g. ghost-cell 
exchanges between nearest neighbors in a domain decomposition 
to use large numbers of processors in lock-step to solve a problem. 
Fortran compilers by Cray and Intel have helped facilitate generat- 
ing multi-threaded and vectorized code where many of the large 
computational loops are automatically partitioned across threads 
for many-core CPU-only clusters. However, to take advantage of in- 
creasing heterogeneity with petascale and exascale supercomput- 
ers  with  low  power  graphics  processing  units  (GPUs)  and  CPUs 
(Central Processing Units). MPI protocol is combined with a direc- 
tive  approach  based  on  the  OpenACC  (open-accelerator,  parallel- 
computing standard developed for CRAY computers) [127] or the 
OpenMP4.5 language [128] to refactor (i.e.,restructure) DNS codes 
on heterogeneous machines. Message passing using MPI + X where 
X can be (CUDA, OpenACC, or OpenMP4.5) still requires substantial 
programming effort since many of the abstractions in MPI are ex- 
pressed at a low level for sending and receiving information. 

Since  message  passing  MPI  protocols  do  not  have  a  higher 
overview  of  the  program,  optimizations  above  this  level  are  the 
responsibility of the programmer. These include deciding how to 
lay out data structures across the machine, decomposing data com- 
munication into concrete sends and receives and interleaving com- 
munication and computation to hide machine latencies. These is- 
sues  are  also  data  dependent,  and  so  for  chemical  mechanisms 
with  varying  size  and  complexity  it  becomes  tedious  to  change 
the distribution of the work load on the machine. To get around 
this  problem,  parallel  scheduling  of  the  work  load  domain  spe- 
ciﬁc  languages  (DSLs)  has  emerged  recently  for  the  case  of  tur- 
bulent reactive ﬂows. This allows domain scientists and engineers 
to  write  code  at  a  high  level  of  abstraction.  This  then  is  trans- 
lated  into  eﬃcient  code  by  lower  levels  of  the  compiler  for  a 
given machine architecture. For example, DSL (domain speciﬁc lan- 
guage)  is  a  language  that  automatically  generates  thermochem- 
istry and transport kernels for different machine instruction sets 
[ 129 , 130 ].  They  discretize  partial  differential  equations  for  reac- 
tive  ﬂow  transport  phenomena  [131] .  Combining  these  DSL  lan- 
guages with an asynchronous programming model gives scientists 
the ability to compose ﬂexible workﬂows on heterogeneous ma- 

chines,  including  swapping  out  chemical  mechanisms,  transport 
models, and even incorporating in situ analytics. 

With the rising complexity and heterogeneity of supercomput- 
ers, power constraints are important so there is a renewed inter- 
est in asynchronous task-based parallel programming model and 
runtime systems [132-134] . This provides the potential to improve 
programmer productivity while providing performance portability 
across  different  machine  architectures.  Asynchronous  task-based 
programming  models  use  dynamic  scheduling  to  decide  where 
tasks  should  be  run  and  where  data  should  be  placed  in  mem- 
ory at runtime. Such models have the ability to hide unpredictable 
latencies in large machines and to support applications with data- 
dependent work (e.g. adaptive mesh reﬁnement, or Lagrangian par- 
ticle  based  approaches  for  spray  treatment).  The  runtime  con- 
structs  a  dynamic  task  graph  which  is  used  to  infer  dependen- 
cies of tasks and the order of execution. It is also able to expose 
both data and task parallelism. Dynamic scheduling is effective in 
providing resiliency to soft and hard machine failures which are 
more abundant due to the large concurrencies of processing units 
needed at the exascale. 

The approach chosen by some researchers is to improve adap- 
tive  mesh  reﬁnement  (AMR)  methods.  Day  and  Bell  [135]  used 
AMR to create a hierarchical system of rectangular grid patches in 
order to create a ﬁne-grained mesh at locations where high resolu- 
tion is needed. AMR is more suitable than uniform grids in the thin 
ﬂamelet  regime.  With  thin  ﬂamelets,  reaction  layers  are  thinner 
than the ﬁnest turbulence scales but the reaction volume is only a 
small fraction of the total volume of the computational domain. If 
reaction zones remain thin but they become densely-packed, then 
a uniform grid might be required. Of course, if the reaction lay- 
ers become broadened or distributed, then a courser grid might be 
suﬃcient to resolve the chemistry, but such a grid still must re- 
main ﬁne enough to resolve the small-scale turbulence. 

The AMR implemented by Day and Bell combines ﬁnite-volume 
discretization with a symmetric operator-split treatment of chem- 
istry.  A  density-weighted  approximate  projection  is  employed  to 
impose  the  evolution  constraint.  Their  algorithm  discretely  con- 
serves species mass and enthalpy. The hybrid programming model 
distributes  data  over  nodes  using  a  message  passing  interface 
(MPI).  Within  the  nodes  ﬁne-grained  parallelization  is  accom- 
plished using a thread-based approach using OpenMP. This hybrid 
programming model enables the code to scale well and has been 
run on 50,0 0 0 processors. The AMR assumption that a ﬁne mesh 
is only needed in a fraction of the volume needs to be assessed. 
Bell and colleagues showed that their AMR-assisted DNS achieved 
good agreement with three experiments: a V-ﬂame, a slot Bunsen 
ﬂame and a low swirl ﬂame [55-57] , all operated with methane-air 
reactants at a relatively low Re 

T . 

Guzik et al. [ 136 , 137 ] have demonstrated how to optimize AMR 
on two parallel heterogeneous architectures: the Central Process- 
ing Unit (CPU) and the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The GPU is 
an accelerator; suitable tasks are delegated to the GPU by the CPU. 
The delegation usually involves a transfer of memory from the CPU 
to the GPU. Experience with explicit algorithms indicates that the 
interconnect between the two memory systems is a serious obsta- 
cle to the implementation of AMR. Guzik and Riley ﬁnd that it is 
advantageous to use the CPU processors for the more serial but 
complex logistical tasks. For massively parallel computations, the 
ﬁnest level will be distributed among the GPUs and exchanges of 
information must occur within the level to ﬁll ghost cells. GPU- 
Direct RDMA technology allows information to be exchanged be- 
tween GPUs without involving the CPU. Truly, GPUs can be used 
as peer processors, rather than co-processors. By placing only the 
ﬁnest mesh computations on the GPU, the need to port logistical 
AMR code to the GPU can be avoided.

A  third  approach  is  called  embedded  DNS  (e-DNS)  or  some- 
times  called  hybrid  DNS-LES  [138-140] .  The  e-DNS  method  has 
been applied to problems for which combustion (or fuel atomiza- 
tion)  occurs  in  a  small  region  that  is  surrounded  by  a  large  re- 
gion in which there is mixing of non-reacting ﬂuids. Within the 
large,  outer  non-reacting  region  it  was  found  to  be  adequate  to 
run LES with a Smagorinsky sub-model on a coarse mesh. In the 
small embedded domain, sub-grid modeling is avoided by running 
DNS.  One  challenge  is  to  match  the  boundary  conditions  of  the 
DNS and LES domains. Sauer, Sadiki and Janicka [138] implemented 
e-DNS to simulate the primary breakup of an air blast atomizer. 
They did not consider any combustion. Their small embedded DNS 
domain was located near the lip of the atomizer where a thin liq- 
uid ﬁlm breaks up into ligaments and drops. One region contains 
only single-phase liquid ﬂow, while a different region contains only 
single-phase gaseous ﬂuid. The authors argue that in the single- 
phase regions a standard Smagorinsky type of LES subgrid model 
can be used with conﬁdence. They demonstrated that if a ﬂow can 
be separated in this way, e-DNS provides large savings in compu- 
tational time with good accuracy. Spalart et al. [139] considered a 
shock wave that interacts with a boundary layer with no combus- 
tion. Embedded DNS was applied to a small region near the wall 
and just downstream of the shock wave where a ﬂow separation 
bubble occurs. They found that e-DNS provided improved agree- 
ment with experiment. 

The  hybrid  DNS/LES  approach  has  been  included  as  part  of 
the DOE Exascale Computing Project for combustion computations. 
DNS captures the turbulence/chemistry interaction near the reac- 
tion regions, while far from the ﬂame the resolution is restricted 
and LES is applied. The project is developing numerical algorithms, 
multi-scale physics sub-models (for sprays, soot and radiation), as 
well as an automated framework for drop-in chemistry models. A 
new suite of AMR compressible and low-Mach codes, called PeleC 
and PeleLM, respectively, incorporate geometric effects using em- 
bedded boundary methodology. This methodology is being devel- 
oped for future use on exascale machines with accelerators, in or- 
der to simulate complex geometries with multi-physics in the fu- 
ture. 

The e-DNS/ hybrid DNS-LES approach is similar to AMR in that 
both  methods  select  certain  regions  to  have  a  ﬁner  grid  resolu- 
tion. With e-DNS the region of coarse mesh is solved using LES, 
so  the  ﬁnal results  could  depend on  the  choice  of  the  LES  sub- 
grid  model.  AMR  does  not  use  a  sub-grid  model,  but  AMR  re- 
quires more computational time than e-DNS. In summary, all three 
new DNS approaches listed above (exascale computing, AMR and 
e-DNS) can extend DNS to higher Reynolds numbers, but each will 
require both larger computers and extensive improvements in the 
area of computer science. It will be required to optimize the com- 
puter architecture, the CFD solution algorithm, the mesh geometry 
and methods to transfer and store large amounts of data. 

A challenge has been how to analyze large DNS data sets in or- 
der to extract physical information about ﬂame structure. Advances 
have been made by employing the Chemical Explosion Mode Anal- 
ysis  (CEMA)  that  was  described  by  Lu  et  al.  [141] .  This  analysis 
helps to identify premixed and non-premixed ﬂamelet surfaces as 
well as the locations of extinction and auto-ignition. For simple fu- 
els with no preheating, this information normally can be extracted 
by  conventional  methods.  However,  with  complex  fuels  such  as 
heptane  or  kerosene  blends  that  mix  with  highly  preheated  air, 
ignition can occur in several stages and at several locations. The 
primary fuel decomposes into many other fuels, so it is not easy 
to distinguish the fuel-air boundary or whether the reactants are 
fully premixed. 

In the CEMA analysis, an explosion index (EI) was deﬁned that 
is positive in the reactants (which are called “explosive”) and is 
negative in products, which are “not explosive”. The EI is deﬁned to 

be the eigenvalue of the Jacobian of the chemical source terms in 
the conservation equations. For a central fuel jet that is surrounded 
by a hot co-ﬂow, DNS of Lu et al. showed that premixing occurs 
upstream of the lifted ﬂame base. The CEMA analysis showed that 
there are islands of ignited mixtures that are disconnected from 
the downstream lifted ﬂame base. This indicates that auto-ignition 
occurs in the mixture of fuel and hot air. This differs from normal 
ﬂame ignition that is caused by the upstream transfer of heat from 
hot combustion products to the reactants. CEMA was able to detect 
ﬂame front boundaries successfully for ultra-lean conditions. The 
ﬂame fronts could not be detected using conventional indicators, 
since there was no sharp rise in gas temperature or radical con- 
centrations.  CEMA  represents an advance in the analysis of  DNS 
data, but it is not reviewed here because it has been described in 
a number of papers [ 2 , 141-143 ]. 

5.2. Laser diagnostics to image new species, at higher repetition rates 

To increase our understanding of premixed ﬂames subjected to 
intense  levels  of  turbulence,  several  new  laser  diagnostics  show 
promise,  but  additional  improvements  are  needed.  This  section 
lists  a  subset  of  recent  advances;  more  details  are  found  in  the 
detailed reviews by Schulz and Sick [144] , Böhm et al. [145] , Sick 
[146] , Papageorge et al. [147] , Patniak et al. [148] and Jiang et al. 
[149] . Table 4 lists some of the more relevant new developments. 
Dr. R.S. Barlow and co-workers at Sandia National Laboratories 
have developed a method called line-Raman imaging with crossed- 
planar OH PLIF. Sweeney et al. [150] applied the method to mea- 
sure mole fractions of several species as well as gas temperature 
over a 5 mm distance along a laser beam in a stratiﬁed premixed 
burner.  They  intersected  the  laser  beam  with  two  perpendicular 
laser sheets that recorded OH PLIF in each sheet. This provided the 
orientation of the instantaneous normal to the ﬂame and allowed 
the  gradients  in  temperature  and  progress  variable  to  be  angle- 
corrected to determine their three-dimensional values. 

The  location  and  structure  of  chemical  reaction  layers  are  of 
interest  and,  fortunately,  they  can  be  imaged  by  the  OH –CH 
2 O 
overlap method. This method was demonstrated by Ayoola et al. 
[151]  and  Bockle  et  al.  [152]  and  by  others  [ 30 , 32 , 36 , 50 , 68 , 70 ]. 
Laser sheets at 355 nm and 283 nm are overlapped and two cam- 
2 O PLIF signals. Since OH only exists at 
eras record the OH and CH 
high  temperatures,  the  locations  where  the  two  PLIF  signals  co- 
exist  marks  locations  were  both  OH  and  CH 
2 O  co-exist  at  high 
temperature. The Arrhenius relation indicates that at such locations 
there must be a chemical reaction between these two species. The 
overlap  method  was  extended  to  extremely  turbulent  ﬂames  by 
Wabel et al. [32] and Skiba et al. [30] . A further improvement was 
to extend the method to 20 kHz framing rates at the AFRL lab of 
C.  D.  Carter  [30] .  They  simultaneously  obtained  stereo-PIV  data, 
which required optical ﬁlters to separate the ﬂuorescence from the 
Mie scattering that was caused by the PIV particles. 

Another way to image reaction layers is the CH PLIF method, 
since CH is a short-lived radical that has been shown to exist in 
reaction  layers  that  are  located  near  the  maximum  heat  release 
locations.  However,  early  work  produced  only  marginal  levels  of 
ﬂuorescence signal. Dr. Carter and colleagues [153-157] greatly in- 
creased  the  CH  signal  by  selecting  a  new  absorption  line.  They 
achieved excellent signal to noise ratios at 10 kHz framing rates for 
pulse energies of 0.2 mJ; an example was shown above in Figs. 3 d 
and 6 c. For methane fuel the CH PLIF signal is maximized if the 
fuel-air equivalence ratio is 1.25 but values between 0.95 and 1.2 
are  acceptable.  Trunk  et  al.  [158]  in  the  TU  Darmstadt  group  of 
A. Dreizler reported a promising method to quantify the 3-D local 
displacement  speed  of  each  segment  along  a  premixed  ﬂamelet. 
They  combined  10 kHz  multi-plane  OH  PLIF  and  stereo-PIV.  The 
displacement  speed  is  deﬁned  to  be  the  difference  between  the

ﬂame velocity and the reactant velocity; both are measured in the 
laboratory frame of reference. To quantify ﬂame velocity they cre- 
ated  two  laser  sheets  to  record  kHz  OH-PLIF  images  on  parallel 
planes. Using 3-D surface ﬁtting they determined the ﬂame-normal 
orientation. The distance that the ﬂame surface moved in the nor- 
mal direction was used to determine ﬂame velocity. The velocity 
of the reactants was recorded using simultaneous stereo-PIV. 

The  group  of  Prof.  Marcus  Aldén  at  Lund  University  demon- 
strated the advantages of using an Alexandrite laser to image HCO 
at  259 nm  [39] .  They  also  report  a  way  to  image  HO 
2 ,  which  is 
important  in  the  chemistry  of  auto-ignition  [159] .  Namely,  their 
photo-fragmentation method employs three laser sheets pulsed in 
succession.  The  ﬂame-generated  OH  is  imaged  using  a  conven- 
tional PLIF light sheet at 283 nm. Then 20 nsec later a high inten- 
sity pump laser sheet at 266 nm photo-dissociates any HO 
2 in the 
sheet into OH and O. A 283 nm sheet is ﬁred 20 nsec later to create 
an OH image that is the sum of the ﬂame-generated OH and the 
additional photo-dissociated OH. The ﬁrst OH image is subtracted 
from the second, leaving only the additional photo-dissociated OH. 
The number of moles of photo-dissociated OH equals the number 
2 that were present prior to the laser pulses. To as- 
of moles of HO 
sess the method, they measured HO 
2 concentrations in a laminar 
ﬂame, and results were found to agree with CHEMKIN computa- 
tions. This method later was applied successfully to an HCCI engine 
[160] . 

Since  turbulence  is  an  inherently  3-D  phenomenon,  there  is 
substantial  interest  in  developing  3-D  tomographic-PLIF  and  3-D 
tomo-PIV  to  provide  improvements over  conventional 2-D  imag- 
ing techniques [ 161 , 162 ]. Fig. 31 illustrates results [161] that were 
obtained by using several cameras to record 2-D videos of CH ﬂu- 
orescence. Many 2-D images, such as those shown on the left of

Other recent tomographic-PLIF diagnostics were demonstrated 
by Li et al. [163] , Pareja et al. [163,164] and Halls et al. [165] . In 
addition, 3-D velocity ﬁelds have been recorded, however, tomo- 
PIV diagnostics are not reviewed here because good reviews have 
been published by Scarano [166] and Atkinson et al. [167] . 

5.2.1. Laser diagnostics for complex fuels 

One  motivation  for  improving  laser  diagnostics  is  that  most 
of  the previous investigations of  premixed turbulent  combustion 
have considered only two fuels: methane and hydrogen, and now 
complex fuels such as heptane, dodecane and kerosene-blends are 
of interest. Therefore, many additional species become important. 
Schulz and Sick [144] and Orain et al. [168] explain that PLIF meth- 
ods  can  be  used  to  image  three  of  the  aromatic  components  of 
kerosene-based  fuels:  toluene,  naphthalene  and  tri-methyl  ben- 
zene.  They  explain  that  other  relevant  species  ﬂuoresce,  includ- 
ing pyrene, 3-pentanone, acetone, biacetyl, OH and formaldehyde. 
However, these species (except for OH) have broadband absorption 
and emission spectra, so care is needed to select the proper laser 
excitation wavelength and emission wavelengths in order to min- 
imize spectral overlap. Orain et al. suggest that a laser excitation 
wavelength  of  266 nm  should  be  selected,  and  that  there  is  lit- 
tle overlap from the emission bands from CH 
2 O, naphthalene and 
tri-methyl benzene that occur in the ranges of 400–450 nm, 460–
480 nm, and 500–520 nm, respectively. Schultz and Sick report that 
toluene ﬂuorescence does not overlap with these bands if it is ex- 
cited  at  248 nm,  since  its  ﬂuorescence  occurs  in  the  range  from 
270 nm to 320 nm. Typically, the absorption and emission spectra 
of OH are not broadband, but consist of lines that are nicely sepa- 
rated from one another. The laser can be slightly de-tuned from a 
known OH absorption line, and if the resulting ﬂuorescence disap- 
pears, this indicates that the ﬂuorescence truly is due to OH. 

Interference problems can arise due to droplets, soot and soot 
precursors that limit the use of ﬂuorescence, Raman and Rayleigh 
scattering  diagnostics.  If  the  fuel  is  not  fully  pre-vaporized,  Mie 
scattering  from  even  the  smallest  droplets  creates  problems  for 
these methods. Droplets can cause attenuation or steering of the 
incident laser sheet and attenuation of the output signal. Chterev 
et al. [169] demonstrated that high-speed OH-PLIF imaging could 
be applied to high-pressure kerosene spray ﬂames. Dhanuka et al. 
[170] and Yuan et al. [171] were able to apply CH 
2 O PLIF diagnos- 
tics to Jet-A and heptane-air ﬂames, respectively, but they limited 
their work to downstream locations where the fuel was fully va- 
porized. 

A very promising way to probe the combustion of complex hy- 
drocarbon fuels is provided by Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman scat- 
tering (CARS) diagnostics. Roy et al. [172] has reviewed CARS stud- 
ies  that  demonstrate  quantitative  measurements  of  temperature 
and species concentrations. Line-CARS now can record proﬁles of 
mole fractions and temperatures along a 2 mm line at the location

where several laser sheets intersect. The species whose mole frac- 
tions  have  been measured  include:  ethylene, acetylene,  H 
4 , 
2  [173-183] .  The  fuels  used  were  ethy- 
CO 
lene and JP-8 as well as methane and hydrogen. In some cases the 
gas temperature was measured simultaneously. Thus, for the study 
of complex fuels, CARS has been shown to have advantages over 
all other diagnostics. However, with CARS the laser alignment and 
data processing efforts are much more complicated than with PLIF 
methods. Currently, CARS development continues in the groups of 
J. Gord at AFRL, R. Lucht and T. Meyer at Purdue University, A. Drei- 
zler at TU Darmstadt, C. Kliewer at Sandia National Laboratory and 
at other locations [173-183] . Roy et al. [178] determined that the 
uncertainty in their CARS temperature measurement was 3% at a 
mean temperature of 1800 K. 

Planar-CARS  recently  has  been  demonstrated  by  Bohlin  and 
Kliewer [183] and Miller et al. [184] and this could provide a ma- 
jor breakthrough in the study of the combustion of complex fu- 
els.  Bohlin  and  Kliewer  recorded  gas  temperature  as  well  as  N 
2 
and O 
2 CARS signal in a laminar methane-air Bunsen ﬂame. Miller 
et al. recorded the temperature ﬁeld at a 1 KHz framing rate in 
a  heated  jet  of  oxygen.  In  both  cases  Planar  CARS  was  used  to 
image a 2 mm × 9 mm region. There were two major complica- 
tions that had to be overcome. To reduce the number of beams re- 
quired, Bohlin and Kliewer developed a non-phase-matched two- 
beam CARS scheme. The pump and the Stokes beams were com- 
bined into a single coherence excitation beam and a polarization 
grating was added. The second issue was that the CARS signal has 
to be spectrally resolved into a set spectral lines using a diffraction 
grating. The resulting spectrum is recorded by a camera, then soft- 
ware provides a best ﬁt to known spectra. Data analysis yields the 
gas temperatures and species concentrations. However, even CARS 
is susceptible to beam steering cause by any droplets or soot parti- 
cles. Moreover, CARS typically requires a far more complex system 
and has less spatial resolution than other diagnostics. 

Laser-induced  breakdown  spectroscopy  (LIBS)  is  being  devel- 
oped to measure the point-wise local fuel-air ratio under super- 
sonic  conditions  by  McGann  et  al.  [185] .  They  dissociated  gas 
molecules using a focused laser beam that has a nanosecond pulse 
duration. The resulting plasma emitted radiation from O, H, N and 
C  atoms  that  was  recorded  in  order  to  determine  the  ethylene 
mole fraction prior to the laser pulse. LIBS was employed to record 
gas  temperature  by  Kiefer  et  al.  [186] .  An  additional  point-wise 
technique for making accurate temperature (to within < 2.5%) and 
species  concentration  measurements  within  harsh  environments 
(e.g., enclosed ﬂames at elevated pressures) is laser-induced grat- 
ing spectroscopy (LIGS). Recently, De Domenico et al. [187] demon- 
strated the ability to simultaneously measure temperature and wa- 
ter concentrations with an accuracy of 2.5% in the products region 
of a premixed laminar methane-air ﬂame operated at 6 bar. While 
a relatively simple ﬂame was run, LIGS has the potential to provide 
accurate quantitative information within harsh environments. Un- 
like PLIF techniques, LIGS signals increase with increased gas pres- 
sure. 

5.2.2. Need for kilohertz imaging 

Several  types  of  transient  events  occur  in  turbulent  combus- 
tion  that  now  can  be  imaged  using  kilohertz  imaging.  Some  of 
these  events  are  brieﬂy  described  in  order  to  emphasize  the 
need to achieve even higher framing rates. Some interesting tran- 
sient  events  include:  (a)  Leading  point  ideas,  (b)  Extinction,  re- 
ignition, ﬂamelet merging and rollup, and (c) Lagrangian tracking 
of  eddies  to  determine  the  residence  times  of  eddies  in  ﬂames. 
The  importance  of  leading  points  was  suggested  by  Baev  and 
Tretyakov [188] as explained by Yuen and Gülder [63] and by Zel- 
dovich, as described in the textbook by Lewis and Von Elbe [4] . 
Leading points were discussed by Lipatnikov and Chomiak [189] , 

Venkateswaran  et  al.  [190] ,  and  others  [ 191 , 192 ].  Suppose  that 
within a turbulent ﬂame brush there is a single, continuous thin 
ﬂamelet that has the shape of a sine wave. Leading points are the 
locations  on  the  sine  wave  that  are  closest  to  the  reactants.  At 
those points the vector that is normal to the sine wave is nearly 
perpendicular to the leading edge of the ﬂame brush. Therefore, it 
was argued that the local propagation speed of each leading point 
T ) of the ﬂame brush. 
should equal the turbulent burning velocity ( S 
Sometimes the value of S 
L . The ques- 
tion arises: how can the local propagation speed of each leading 
point be as large as S 

T is as large as twenty times S 

T ? 

One possible explanation is that streamlines diverge upstream 
of each leading point, causing the velocity of the gas to decrease as 
it approaches each leading point. Streamline divergence is known 
to occur upstream of cells that are created by a hydrodynamic in- 
stability. A different explanation is based on the theory of ﬂame 
stretch. The curvature of a ﬂamelet near a leading point must be 
positive  (i.e.,  convex  toward  the  reactants).  If  the  Lewis  number 
( Le ) is less than one, theory predicts that positive curvature will 
cause the local propagation speed to increase. DNS of Gran et al. 
[192]  and  Aspden  et  al.  [19]  veriﬁed  this  idea.  Lieuwen  and  co- 
workers  [ 190 , 191 ]  computed  the  speeds  of  laminar  counter  ﬂow 
ﬂames having Le < 1 and found that as the stretch rate was in- 
creased, the  speed reached a  maximum  value.  They  argued that 
the maximum speed is related to the propagation speed of a lead- 
ing  point.  An  unanswered  question  arises  because  this  logic  ap- 
pears to fail for cases when Le exceeds unity. For such cases, the 
positive curvature at a leading point reduces its propagation speed. 
A possible answer is that several factors affect the propagation of 
leading points. 

P ) S 

A suggested explanation of leading point propagation speeds is 
the “jet propulsion idea” that is outlined in Ref. [4] . Recall that a 
laminar  spherical  ﬂame  moves  radially  outward  at  a  speed  that 
greatly exceeds its propagation speed [64] . Conservation of mass 
(in the ﬂame frame of reference) requires the spherical ﬂame to 
move radially outward at a speed dR/dt that equals ( ρ
R / ρ
L . This 
L .  As  the  sphere  of  hot 
value  is  typically  six  times  larger  than  S 
products expands, reactants are pushed outwards at a speed that 
L . Since the spherical ﬂame moves outward 
is typically ﬁve times S 
at  6  S 
L . 
Now suppose that a thin ﬂamelet contains a wrinkle that has the 
shape of half of a sphere. The leading point is the apex of the wrin- 
kle. Streams of products issue downstream from all points on the 
half-sphere and they impinge upon each other. While these prod- 
uct streams are not as conﬁned as they would be in a spherical 
ﬂame, they could propel the leading point forward. Details of this 
idea [4] are similar to explanations of the growth of cells caused 
by a cellular instability. 

L ,  it  overtakes  the  reactants  at  a  propagation  speed  of  S 

Rapid propagation of leading points could be due to unsteady 
motion of the ﬂame front. Near each trailing point of the wrin- 
kle the wave propagates normal to itself and so, due to Huyghen’s 
principle, the trailing point becomes a cusp. Inside a cusp the pre- 
heat  layer  on  one  side  effectively  preheats  the  other  side.  This 
could propel the trailing edges forward so fast that they rapidly 
become leading points that move forward at a speed that exceeds 
L . Future research with DNS and kilohertz diagnostics may verify 
S 
some of the current leading point ideas. 

Kilohertz  lasers  provide  a  way  to  image  important  transient 
events, such as local extinction and re-ignition, as shown by Stein- 
berg et al. [193] and by Skiba et al. [30] . In Fig. 32 the dark blue 
vorticity region is shown by Steinberg et al. to exert strain and cre- 
ate a hole in a reaction layer. The hole is the region where OH 
has disappeared in the lower images. Their ﬂame initially is non- 
premixed, but where it extinguishes there exists a premixed re- 
gion. The lower portion of Fig. 32 shows how the two premixed 
edge-ﬂames propagate toward each other to re-ignite the reaction

layer. A 10 kHz OH PLIF system provided images in crossed planes, 
so that ﬂame motions could be separated into motions within the 
PIV plane and those that are out-of-the PIV plane. If a curved re- 
gion of a ﬂame moves perpendicular to a laser sheet it will give the 
erroneous appearance of propagating outward, so Steinberg et al. 
took care to statistically analyze only the in-plane motions. A La- 
grangian  method  then  was  employed  to  separate  the  convective 
motions of the ﬂame front from its propagation (i.e., motion with 
respect to the reactants). They concluded that the well-established 
theory of edge-ﬂames adequately explains their observed transient 
re-ignition of reaction layers. They reported the edge-ﬂame propa- 
gation speeds and relevant statistics. 

Transient ﬂame extinction was imaged by Skiba et al. [30] as 
was seen in Fig. 12 . They operated a piloted Bunsen burner and 
for  a  few  special  cases  they  reduced  their  outer  pilot  ﬂow  rate 
to  allow  pockets  of  cold  air  to  be  entrained  into  the  products. 
Fig. 12 showed that as a pocket of cold air approaches the reac- 
tion layer it causes the reaction layer to extinguish. Figs. 12 and 
30 present examples of how broken ﬂamelets can be caused by 
poor-back-support. For example, within swirl ﬂames some pockets 
of cool gases may be entrained from wall regions; this is likely to 
create broken reaction layers. 

One  other  important  transient  phenomenon  is  the  local  dis- 
placement  speed;  a  new  way  to  measure  this  speed  is  the  La- 
grangian Tracking Method developed by Osborne et al. [194] . Lo- 
cal displacement speed is deﬁned to be the ﬂame thickness ( δ) di- 
vided by the time ( (cid:9)t ) required for the wave to propagate a dis- 
tance of δ. Osborne et al. argue that if one considers the frame of 
reference of the ﬂamelet, (cid:9)t is the time required for a ﬂuid par- 
ticle to traverse the distance δ. To measure (cid:9)t they recorded the 
contours of the leading and trailing edges of broadened ﬂamelets 
using multi-plane 10 kHz OH and CH 
2 O PLIF. They simultaneously 
applied 10 kHz tomographic-PIV to record the 3-D velocity vector 
ﬁeld.  This  information  allowed  them  to  track  the  paths  of  ﬂuid 
elements  and  to  determine  (cid:9)t .  Fig.  33  contains  curves  of  dis- 
tance versus time; the slopes of the curves indicate the local dis- 
placement speeds. Osborne et al. conclude that local displacement 
speed  increases  when  ﬂamelet  broadening  occurs.  Their  ﬁnding 
veriﬁes Damköhler’s prediction that turbulent diffusivity increases 
both the displacement speed and the preheat zone thickness. They 
note that these results are consistent with DNS results of Day et al. 
[195]  and  Hamlington  et  al.  [196] ,  even  though  the  simulations 
were limited to smaller Karlovitz numbers than the experiment. 

Kilohertz lasers have provided information about the unsteady 
merging of ﬂamelets caused by reaction layers that burn toward

each  other.  Extreme  turbulence  causes  fractal-like  and  densely- 
packed  ﬂamelets  that  were  displayed  in  Fig.  6 c.  To  observe  the 
time history of such events, Fig. 34 shows CH layers that were im- 
aged  at  10 kHz  by  Skiba  et  al.  [197] .  The  merging  rate  M  is  the 
number of merging events per second per unit volume. This quan- 
tity  appears  as  a  destruction  term  in  the  conservation  equation

K  is  the  stretch  rate  that  produces  ﬂame  surface  area.  Ref. 
[197]  quantiﬁes  the  2-D  merging  rate  and,  with  appropriate  as- 
sumptions. the 3-D merging rate can be estimated. 

Another  good  example  of  the  usefulness  of  kilohertz  imag- 
ing was the study of combustion instabilities by Steinberg et al. 
[ 198 , 199 ]. Stereo PIV and OH PLIF systems were operated at 5 kHz 
to  quantify  the  inﬂuence  of  the  precession  of  a  vortex  core  on 
the dynamics of a swirl ﬂame. They quantiﬁed the coupling be- 
tween  the  oscillations  in  heat  release  rate  and  vortex  core  pre- 
cession. If the two oscillations are in phase, pressure ﬂuctuations 
can  be  ampliﬁed  to  create  a  combustion  instability.  The  red  re- 
gions in the upper image in Fig. 35 mark the ﬂame surface den- 
sity, which is a good indicator of the unsteady heat release ﬁeld. 
The blue and red regions in the lower images mark the vorticity 
ﬁeld. Kilohertz imaging results that quantify combustion instabil- 
ities also were reported by Stöhr et al. [199] , Böhm et al. [200] , 
Allison et al. [201] and Chen et al. [202] . 

5.2.3. Advances in ultra-fast kilohertz imaging 

In  recent  years  there  have  been  several  major  new  improve- 
ments  in  the  area  of  kilohertz  laser  technology;  one  is  the  de- 
velopment of the pulse-burst laser for which framing rates up to 
10 0 0 kHz have been achieved [ 203 , 204 ]. A pulse-burst laser emits 
one burst of laser pulses every few seconds. Each burst may consist 
of 100–1000 laser pulses within the burst time of 10 ms. For exam- 
ple, if the pulses within the burst are separated by 50 microsec- 
onds, images can be collected at a 20 kHz framing rate. To achieve 
a PLIF framing rate of 10 0 0 kHz, a special pulse-burst laser was as- 
sembled by the Ohio State University team of Jiang, Lempert, Sut- 
ton and colleagues [204] . Their pump laser has seven custom-built 
ampliﬁers and is larger than commercially available systems. This 
laser pumps a custom-built optical parametric oscillator (OPO) dye 
laser  that outputs  radiation at  226 nm.  However, the  energy per 
pulse was small (less than one mJ) and the imaging was conﬁned

outputting as much as 0.150 mJ/pulse continuously at 283 nm and 
recorded OH-PLIF at 50 kHz. 

Hammack  et  al.  [157]  showed  that  it  is  possible  to  simulta- 
neous  image  OH,  CH 
2 O  and  the  3-component  velocity  ﬁeld  us- 
ing  stereo-PIV  at  a  20 kHz  framing  rate.  A  single  commercially- 
available pulse-burst laser (Spectral Energies Quasi-Modo) excited 
CH 
2 O at 355 nm and provided dual pulses at 532 nm for stereo-PIV 
measurements. Each burst contained 100 pulses. A separate Edge- 
wave Nd:YVO4 laser pumped a Sirah Credo dye laser to excite OH 
near 283 nm. Unlike the above 50 kHz diagnostics, for the 20 kHz 
AFRL effort no sacriﬁce in camera pixels was required; the CMOS 
Photron SA-Z cameras were operated full frame (1024 × 1024 pix- 
els). The resolution allowed vorticity to be measured from stereo- 
PIV data. An eddy of 0.93 mm diameter could be resolved, which 
is two times the laminar ﬂame thicknesses, but is larger than the 
smallest eddies that were expected. Additional applications of kilo- 
hertz lasers are described in Refs. [209-213] . 

6. Concluding remarks 

1. Several new experimental and DNS data bases now are avail- 
able that help to explain the effects of extreme turbulence on 
premixed ﬂames. Results are shown to be useful in assessing 
some previous theoretical predictions. Experiments include the 
Sydney PPJB piloted jet, the Michigan Hi-Pilot Bunsen burner 
and the Lund LUPJ jet burner.

2. Broadening of preheat layers was observed in four experiments 
(at  Michigan/AFRL,  Toronto,  Sydney  and  Lund).  From  the  re- 
sults  of  those  efforts,  the  measured  boundary  of  broadening 
was determined in Ref. [30] to be where the turbulent diffu- 
sivity ( u’ 
Taylor ) that is based on the Taylor scale, exceeds 
13.8 ν
300 K . This boundary corresponds to a value of the turbu-

lent Reynolds number, based on Taylor scales ( Re 
The corresponding turbulent Reynolds number, based on inte- 
gral scales, is 2800. The measured boundary of broadening has 
a negative slope on a Borghi plot, and it does not agree with 
the predicted boundary that has a positive slope. This indicates 
that broadening does not begin when the Kolmogorov eddy size 
equals the laminar ﬂame thickness. 

3. The DNS study of Wang et al. was able to simulate a realistic 
burner (the Lund LUPJ jet experiment) at extreme turbulence 
T  (exceeding  30 0 0)  was  achieved  at  down- 
levels.  A  large  Re 
stream locations where the integral scale was large, while Ka T,P 
was large (exceeding 350) at upstream locations where the in- 
tegral scale was small. The good agreement of their results with 
measured proﬁles indicates that DNS now can simulate realistic 
geometries at reasonable Reynolds numbers, but with consider- 
able computational cost.

to a non-reacting air ﬂow that was heavily seeded with 2% NO or 
NO 
2 . Such a mole fraction is much larger than typical mole frac- 
tions of species of interest in combustion applications. One draw- 
back to imaging at 10 0 0 kHz, is that the full sensor (1 Megapixel) 
of state-of-the-art CMOS cameras cannot be read out suﬃciently 
fast, and thus a reduced sensor size of 80 × 160 pixels was used.. 
Using a similar laser, Patton et al. [205] imaged gas temperature 
in a combustion experiment using Rayleigh scattering at framing 
rates of 40 kHz. 

For  combustion  studies,  the  100 kHz  work  of  Miller  et  al. 
[206]  represents  some  of  the  highest  framing  rates  reported  to 
date.  For  combustion  applications  it  is  desired  to  image  species 
that have small concentrations and to operate with all of the pix- 
els of the camera (1024 by 1024 pixels). Miller et al. created large 
concentrations of CH 
2 O by burning ethylene fuel; dimethyl ether is 
another fuel that be used for this purpose. To operate their Photron 
SA-Z cameras and LaVision HS-IRO intensiﬁers at 100 kHz, Miller 
et al. reduced the number of pixels to 640 × 280 pixels. Li et al. at 
Lund University [207] achieved 50 kHz imaging of OH PLIF in a dif- 
ferent way; they created a short burst of eight laser pulses by oper- 
ating four conventional Nd:YAG lasers but pulsing each twice. Eight 
images were collected at a 50 kHz framing rate. In addition, Ham- 
4  laser  (pro- 
mack  et  al.  [208]  used  a  50-kHz  Edgewave  Nd:YVO

4. DNS of the Lund jet ﬂame shows that preheat layer broaden- 
ing occurs, but only a few conditions could be considered due 
to computational costs. The few DNS results available are con- 
sistent with the measured regime boundary. However, DNS has 
not yet been able to compute regime boundaries because of the 
excessive cost of simulating a wide range of integral scales. 
5. Reaction layer thicknesses were measured in experiments and 
computed  using  DNS.  In  all  cases  they  are  not  signiﬁcantly 
broadened, even when preheat layers are broadened by a fac- 
tor of ten and u’/S 
L is as large as 124. While reaction layers re- 
main thin, they become so wrinkled that they have a fractal- 
like shape. 

6. The broken ﬂamelet regime is deﬁned to consist of many small 
segments of extinguished reactions that occupy more than 10% 
of  the  ﬂame-front  surface.  This  regime  was  not  observed  in 
any  of  the  four  experiments  or  in  the  DNS  of  a  jet  ﬂame  in 
the  extreme  turbulence  range.  This  is  surprising  because  the 
Karlovitz  numbers  were  more  than  ﬁve  times  the  predicted 
limit  ( Ka T,P = 100).  Some  segments  of  local  extinction  are  ob- 
served in four experiments, but they appear to account for less 
than  10%  of  the  ﬂame  surface.  A  caveat  is  that  these  state- 
ments have been conﬁrmed only for methane-air piloted ﬂames 
with good back support. Segments of local extinction have been 
shown to be created by allowing cool air to be entrained into 
the hot products (i.e., poor back support). This occurs in burn- 
ers that are not piloted or contain recirculation zones. There- 
fore, the results of several studies disagree with the prediction 
that Ka T,P = 100 alone determines the boundary of the broken 
ﬂamelet regime. 

7. The  broken  ﬂamelet  regime  has  been  observed  in  the  DNS 
simulations  of  turbulence  in  a  box  by  Aspden  et  al.  [18]  for 
Karlovitz number Ka T,P  of 1562, which is 15.62 times the pre- 
dicted boundary. Large turbulence forcing terms were added to 
the momentum equation and small integral scales of 1–2 mm 
were selected. 

8. Distributed (i.e., ﬂameless) combustion has been shown to oc- 
cur  by  Pitsch,  Peters,  Dally  and  others  by  preheating  the  re- 
actants  to  over  10 0 0 K  and  diluting  the  oxidizer  with  inerts 
to  lower  the  O 
2  level  to  less  than  12%.  However,  distributed 
combustion  was  not  achieved  in  the  Hi-Pilot  burner  by  in- 
L of 124 or Ka T,P of 
creasing the turbulence levels alone (to u’/S 
550,  with  methane-air  reactants  and  no  preheat  or  dilution). 
Thus, the prediction that extreme turbulence alone can cause 
distributed combustion is not in agreement with experiments. 
DNS  of  turbulence  in  a  box  by  Aspden  [18]  has  shown  that 
combustion becomes distributed if Karlovitz number is raised 
to 8700, which is 87 times the predicted boundary. Achieving 
this value in a future experiment is not likely. There continues 
to be a need to quantify the distributed regime boundary, and 
the role of any new governing parameters. 

9. The above conclusions indicate that it is speculative to assume 
that ﬂames in an experiment or DNS lie in a certain regime, 
based only on the predicted regime boundaries that previously 
have appeared on a Borghi regime plot. Recent results conclu- 
sively show that the regimes of premixed turbulent combustion 
depend on other governing parameters, in addition to the two 
axes of the Borghi regime diagram ( u’/S 

L and L x / δ

L,P ) 

10. State  relations  (i.e.,  conditional  mean  proﬁles)  for  extremely 
turbulent ﬂames have been reported by four experimental and 
several  DNS  studies.  State  relations  are  obtained  by  plotting 
instantaneous species mass fractions against progress variable 
(such as gas temperature). Surprisingly, the measured and DNS 
state relations, even for extreme turbulence levels, do not de- 
viate  signiﬁcantly  from  laminar  ﬂamelet  proﬁles.  This  state- 
ment only has been veriﬁed for cases when the reactants are 
methane-air  and  are  not  preheated  or  diluted.  Additional  re- 

search  is  needed  to  determine  if  state  relations  deviate  from 
laminar proﬁles for complex fuels that are preheated and di- 
luted with inerts. 

11. State relations computed by DNS for turbulent lean methane- 
air  [12]  and  heptane-air  ﬂames  [23]  agree  with  laminar  pro- 
ﬁles, providing that the laminar proﬁles are computed for unity 
Lewis  number.  This  supports  the  validity  of  ﬂamelet  models 
that employ laminar state relations that are computed for unity 
Lewis number. DNS results of Aspden et al. [19] showed that 
differential diffusion effects in lean hydrogen-air ﬂames are not 
signiﬁcant at Re 

T of 4200. 

12. The experimental and DNS ﬁndings indicate that ﬂamelets are 
more robust than has been previously believed. Increasing the 
turbulence level alone did not cause ﬂamelet state relations to 
become invalid. However, a caveat is that most of the research 
reviewed here was limited to simple fuels (methane and hydro- 
gen), and cold room air was prevented from entering the prod- 
ucts by a stream of hot products from a pilot ﬂame. 

13. Turbulent burning velocity (S 

T ) has been measured for turbu- 
lence levels ( u ’/ S 
L ) up to 163, that is 6.7 times that the level of 
previous work (achieved by Yuen and Gülder [61] ). The bending 
of the curves that was reported by Yuen and Gülder and oth- 
ers continues in the regime of extreme turbulence. Bending of 
the S 
L of 
T curves occurs at approximately the same value of u ’/ S 
15 when the preheat layers become broadened, which supports 
the prediction of  Damköhler.  That is, both the  laminar burn- 
ing velocity and the laminar ﬂame thickness are known to scale 
as the square root of molecular diffusivity. Damköhler replaced 
molecular  diffusivity  with  turbulent  diffusivity.  Thus  one  fac- 
tor that appears to cause bending, is the turbulent diffusivity, 
and the evidence indicates that bending does not result from 
ﬂamelet quenching or merging. However DNS results have in- 
dicated that other factors also may be important. 

14. Yuen and Gülder and others have reported a large difference 
between two turbulent burning velocities ( S 
T ) that are based on 
(a) the total mass ﬂow rate of reactants consumed, and (b) the 
total area of the wrinkled ﬂame surface. For extreme levels of 
turbulence, this difference is found to persist [34] . The second 
T relies on the assumption that the local propagation 
value of S 
speed of each ﬂame segments is S 
L . This assumptions has been 
questioned and has been modiﬁed in recent analyses. 

15. The  role  of  the  pilot  ﬂame  is  discussed,  since  all  of  the  jet 
and Bunsen experiments reviewed (and the jet ﬂame DNS) em- 
ployed  a  pilot  ﬂame.  Conditions  are  called  “nearly  matched 
back-support” if the equivalence ratio and fuel type of the pi- 
lot  and  main  ﬂames  are  nearly  matched;  otherwise  they  are 
called “mismatched”. It has been argued that the pilot has no 
effect on the main ﬂame for “nearly matched” conditions be- 
cause the pilot gases have same temperature and composition 
as the products from the main ﬂame. Then the pilot simply ex- 
tends the radial extent of the product region in order to pre- 
vent the entrainment of room air. For “mismatched” conditions 
the hot pilot gases may either increase or decrease the strain 
rate required for the local extinction of the main ﬂame. Most 
of the LUPJ, PPJB and Hi-Piloted cases were “nearly matched”
but  a  few  cases  of  ultra-lean  main  ﬂames  were  mismatched. 
Both  matched  and  mismatched  cases  can  be  simulated  with 
DNS or with LES models by applying the appropriate bound- 
ary conditions. DNS of Wang et al. [12] quantiﬁed the effects of 
stratiﬁcation induced by a large mismatch – when an ultra-lean 
ﬂame is surrounded by a stoichiometric pilot. Their large mis- 
match caused higher intensity burning, enhanced radical pools, 
and thinner ﬂames. Near ﬁeld fuel consumption was enhanced 
causing downstream accumulation of intermediates. 

16. Some  future  challenges  are  discussed.  There  is  a  need  for 
more DNS simulations of realistic burner geometries at realistic 

32

Reynolds numbers, as was demonstrated by Wang et al.  [12- 
16] . DNS of turbulence in a box reveals interesting trends, but 
quantitative comparisons to experiment are not possible. Pos- 
sible improvements to DNS include: exascale computing, adap- 
tive mesh reﬁnement and embedded DNS. 

17. A major driving force is the need to investigate the turbulent 
combustion of complex hydrocarbon fuels. The HyChem mech- 
anism  offers  promise  in  simplifying  the  kinetics  required  for 
models  and  DNS.  Existing  laser  diagnostics  such  as  OH  PLIF, 
CH 
2 O PLIF and PIV have been demonstrated with kerosene fu- 
els, but above a pressure of 5 atm. the interferences from soot 
precursors and soot radiation become a serious challenge. Line 
CARS has successfully recorded mass fractions of many species 
and gas temperature when complex fuels are burned, and pla- 
nar CARS has been shown to be feasible.
