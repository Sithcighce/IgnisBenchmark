The emergence of single atom sites as a frontier research area in catalysis has sparked extensive academic and
industrial interest, especially for energy, environmental and chemicals production processes. Single atom cata-
lysts (SACs) have shown remarkable performance in a variety of catalytic reactions, demonstrating high selec-
tivity to the products of interest, long lifespan, high stability and more importantly high atomic metal utilization
efficiency. In this review, we unveil in depth insights on development and achievements of SACs, including (a)
Chronological progress on SACs development, (b) Recent advances in SACs synthesis, (c) Spatial and temporal
SACs  characterization  techniques,  (d)  Application  of  SACs  in  different  energy  and  chemical  production,  (e)
Environmental and economic aspects of SACs, and (f) Current challenges, promising ideas and future prospects
for SACs. On a whole, this review serves to enlighten scientists and engineers in developing fundamental catalytic
understanding that can be applied into the future, both for academia or valorizing chemical processes.

1. Introduction

The first appearance of the term “catalysis” can be backdated to the
early 19th Century. J ̈ons Jacob Berzelius, who was one of the founders of
modern chemistry, had successfully discovered the existence of catalytic
energy [1], whereas the first-ever documented catalyst application can
be  traced  even  earlier  to  the  alchemical  era  (4th  century  BC)  [2].

Initially,  industrial  catalysts  were  mainly  used  in  the  Deacon  process
(the transformation of HCl gas in oxygen to H2O and Cl), sulphuric acid
production, Ostwald process (production of nitric acid from ammonia),
and the Haber-Bosch process (production of ammonia via nitrogen fix-
ation). To-date, its usage has been extended further into the majority of
current industrial chemical productions [3]. Evidence has shown that
the development of catalysts was one of the key factors that influence
the  sustainability  and  performance  of  catalytic  processes,  in  terms  of

economic viability, technology feasibility, and environmental impacts
[4,5]. Ever since the commercial usage of catalysts has been widespread
around the globe. The subsequent innovation and revolution of catalyst
development have ceaselessly progressed (Fig. 1). This review focuses
on  the  emerging  catalyst  technologies  from  the  last  decade  to
state-of-the-art,  atom  efficiency  and  sustainable  single  atom  catalysts
(SACs) as well as highlighting the frontiers for future research into clean
energy and growth.

The term SAC refers to a catalyst where individual metal atoms are
isolated and dispersed across/throughout a supporting material [13]. To
retain  such  high  atomic  dispersion  efficiency,  strong  interactions  be-
tween the isolated metal atoms and the coordination sites are exerted,
creating  a  unique  tunable  electronic  structure.  The  single  atom-level
dispersion  of  metal  atoms  on  a  support  is  not  only  able  to  maximize
the atomic efficiency by offering a greater number of active sites but at
the same time generate uniform and well-engineered active sites [14].
These sites can be altered to finely tune the reactivity and selectivity of
chemical  reactions  by  manipulating  coordination  sites  (e.g.,  ligand
tuning) and defect designs [15]. In addition, undesirable deleterious side

reactions can be mitigated if requiring more than one atomic active site,
due to the high dispersion and isolation [16]. These compounded fea-
tures lead to a remarkable catalytic performance which has been found
to outperform conventional mono/bimetallic catalysts with bulk nano-
particles. Therefore, SACs (plural of a single atom catalyst) are currently
noted  as  “rising  stars”  for  the  future  of  sustainably  producing  fine
chemicals [17] and are often envisioned as the natural bridge between
heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis [18]. Fig. 2 presents some of
the major research contributions related to the use of single atoms as
catalysts in chronological order.

Although  single  atom  sites  have  a  long  history  in  heterogeneous
catalysis spanning over five decades, the term SAC was first introduced
in 2011 by Qiao et al. [19]. This work serves as an attempt to examine
whether a single atom (denoted as M1 where M is the active metal used)
can  provide  better  catalytic  activity,  selectivity,  and  stability  as
compared to other nanometer-sized and sub-nanometer-sized particles
(i.e. clusters or atom ensembles). In general, the synthesized Pt1/FeOx
SAC  catalysts  show  greater  reactivity  for  both  CO  oxidation  and  the
Preferential  Oxidation  Reaction  (PROX)  reaction  (by  2–3  times)  than

that  of  bulk  nanoparticle-based  Au/Fe2O3  catalysts,  capable  of
providing  high  reactivity  for  CO  oxidation  [20,21].  In  addition,  the
Pt1/FeOx  SAC was found to be fully regenerated even after 2 cycles of
thermal treatments. These findings were no doubt a bombshell to the
research community, given that the commercial Pt/Al2O3  catalysts are
often less favorable than Au/Fe2O3 catalysts for both CO oxidation and
PROX reaction due to their higher cost. This research proved that a high
atomic efficiency level catalyst is one of the feasible directions for the
future  of  sustainable  catalysis  research,  especially  chemical  reactions
that require high noble metal loadings. A year later, a study conducted

by  Kyriakou  et  al.  [22]  found  that  lower  activation  energy  (Ea)  for
hydrogen dissociation can be achieved by using isolated Pd atoms across
a Cu(111) surface under ultra-high vacuum conditions for hydrogena-
tion reactions. The authors used the term Single Atom Alloy (SAA) to
describe this class of material. In the same year, Knurr and Weber [23]
explored  the  theoretical  design  of  SACs  for  the  solvent-driven  CO2
reduction process via a first-principle calculation. Lin et al. [24], on the
other hand, extended the utility of SACs to the water gas shift (WGS)
reaction  in  2013.  Both  Pt1/FeOx  and  Ir1/FeOx  catalysts  showed
extraordinary catalytic performance for WGS, presenting a specific rate

of around 2–3 times higher than previous Pt/MoC and Au/CeOx  cata-
lysts. Another interesting finding was reported in the work conducted by
Wang et al. [25], which investigated the selective catalytic reduction of
NO in the presence of H2  with an Rh1/Co3O4  catalyst. The surface of
Rh1/Co3O4  had  reconstructed  into  RhCon/Co3O4,  an  SAA  at  220
C.
More interestingly, this re-constructed catalyst offered superior catalytic
performance, when compared with its original form. In addition to the
Rh–Co  alloy,  the  catalytic  activity  enhancement  on  CO  oxidation
attributed to the single transition metal-atom substitution in V4O10 has
also  been  studied  based  on  Density  Functional  Theory  (DFT)  calcula-
tions [26]. Aside from this, an advanced fabrication technique “atomic
layer deposition (ALD)” has been discovered to design and synthesize a
SAC with atomic-level control on its composition and thickness [27].

Thereafter, numerous works have discovered the potential of noble
metal-based  SACs  for  various  reactions,  which  include,  but  are  not
limited  to  glucose  oxidation  using  Au1/Pd  nano  clusters  [28],  the
reduction  of  I3
using  Pt1/FeOx  [29],  HCHO  oxidation  with
Ag1/hollandite  manganese  oxide  [30],  syngas-to-C2  oxygenates  con-
version with Rh-based SACs [31], N-alkylation and α-alkylation using
Ir1-doped  polypyrrole  [32]  and  Zn1/N-co-doped  porous  carbon  [33],
CH4  oxidation  using  Pt1/La2O3  (NM  indicates  noble  metal)  [34].  A
major use of SACs and SAAs has been found for hydrogenation reactions,
specifically, nitroarenes using Pt1/FeOx [35], 1,3-butadiene using both
Pd1/graphene  [36]  and  Pt1/m-Al2O3  [37].  Other  reactions  have  been
NO  reduction  with  Pt1/FeOx  [38],  hydroformylation  of  olefins  using
Rh1/ZnO [39], oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using Rh1, Ru1, Ir1 and

Pd1  supported on Co3O4  [40], and extensively for CO oxidation using
various atomic catalysts such as Au1, Rh1, Pd1, Cu1, Ru1, Ti1/FeOx [41].
In addition, the study on the use of a SAA has also been extended for
other reactions such as the Ullmann reaction of aryl halides using Au–Pd
SAA [42], the dehydrogenation of propane using Cu–Pd SAA [43], the
hydrogenation of C2H2  using Ag–Pd SAA [44], the oxidation of formic
acid using Ag–Pt SAA [45], the selective hydrogenation of furfural using
Pd atoms alloyed into a Cu nanoparticle supported on alumina [46] and
the dehydrogenation of 4-hydroxypentanoic acid [47]. In addition to the
reactions shown above, the use of single atoms has been effective for
electrochemical applications, work can be found starting from 2015 and
has been extensively explored from 2016 onwards. These applications
encompass  Oxygen  Reduction  Reactions  (ORR)  using  Pt1/TiN  [48],
Pt1/zeolite-templated carbon [49] and have recently extended to a SAA
which  contains  Pt1  and  Co  nanoparticles  that  co-encapsulated  on
N-doped  graphitized  carbon  nanotubes  [50].  Hydrogen  Evolution  Re-
actions  (HER)  have  been  studied  using  Pt1  over  2D  g-C3N4  [51],
CoP-based  nanotubes  [52],  curved  carbon  supports  [53],  and  TiO2
nanosheets  modified  with  graphene  [54].  Additionally,  the  electro-
chemical NO reduction was explored using Pt-CTF/CP [55], N2  reduc-
tion using Mo1/N-doped carbon [56] and Ru1/N-doped porous carbon
[57]. The electrochemical CO2  reduction reaction (CO2RR) was inves-
tigated using various atom systems utilizing metals such as Pt1, Pd1, Cu1
and Ag1/graphene [58].

Despite the astounding performance of noble metal-based SACs, the
high unit price and the low abundance of noble metals are undoubtedly

A.C.M. Loy et al.

the  key  compromising  factors  that  hamper  the  wide  employment  of
SACs [59,60]. With the motivation for enhancing the sustainability of
SACs deployment, a notable number of research works have been con-
ducted to examine the potential of noble metal-free SACs. In 2013, Wang
et al. [26] performed a systematic DFT calculation to examine the po-
tential  of  four  single-atom  transition  metals  for  CO  oxidation,  where
three of them were non-noble metals (i.e. Sc1, Ti1, and Co1). To the best
of  the  authors’  knowledge,  this  is  the  earliest  reported application  of
non-noble metal-based SACs. The attention on non-noble metal-based
SACs  has  grown  rapidly  since  2018.  Their  applications  have  been
extended  to  non-oxidative  CH4  conversion  using  Fe1/SiO2  [61];  HER
with  Co1  on  N-doped  graphene  [59],  graphitic  carbon  nitride  [62],
N-doped graphyne [63], and Ni1  on α-SiX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) [64];
ethylene benzene oxidation using Co1/CN [65]; electrocatalytic ethanol
oxidation  using  a  hybrid  material  of  Pd  nanoparticles  and  Ni1  single
atom  [66];  oxidative  desulphurization  with  Cr1/multiwalled  carbon
nanotubes [67]; CO oxidation using Ni1  over FeOx  [68], phosphorene
nanosheet [69], Sc1  and Fe1  on honeycomb borophene/Al(111) heter-
ostructure [70], and Ti1 on MXene [71]; acetylene hydration using Zn1
with  S/N  co-doped  defective  graphene  supports  [72];  the  electro-
chemical  CO2RR  with  Ni1  on  N-doped  porous  carbon  [73],  graphene
nanosheets [74], carbon black [75] and other ZnN4-based SACs [76];
CO2 hydrogenation with various non-noble metal-based SAC (Mn1, Fe1,
Co1,  Mo1)  supported  on  graphitic  carbon  nitride  [77];  ORR  has  been
carried out with Co1  on defective N-doped carbon graphene [78], Fe1
supported  on  N-doped  porous  carbon  [79],  hierarchically  structured
porous  carbon  [80],  cellulose-derived  nanocarbon  [81]  and  phospho-
molybdic acid cluster [82]; and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)
has been carried out on Fe, Co and Ni-based SACs on N-doped graphene
[83], N-doped biomass-derived porous carbon [84] as well as γ-graph-
yne  monolayer  [85].  Lastly,  the  production  of  H2O2  was  found  to  be
effective via hydrogenation routes Ni-based SACs [86]. In fact, based on
the  comparative  studies  conducted  in  some  of  these  works,  the
non-noble  metal-based  SACs  were  found  to  be  more  attractive  and
preferable.  For  instance,  Liang  et  al.  [68]  found  that  the  molecular
interaction  between  a  Ni  atom  and  an  adsorbed  CO  gas  molecule  is
weaker than CO binding irreversibly with Pt1 and Ir1 atoms. This further
leads to a lower barrier in CO2 formation (i.e., enhances the CO oxida-
tion  process)  under  the  use  of  Ni.  A  recent  computational  study  also
suggested that the Fe-, Co- and Ni-based SACs were capable of providing
a comparable catalytic activity for CO oxidation as compared with the
noble  metal-based SACs (e.g.,  Pd-, Pt-,  Ru- and  Rh-based  SACs) [87].
However, on the flip side, some studies focused on exploring strategies
to combat the economic drawbacks of noble metal-based catalysts (e.g.,
Wang et al.  [88] found that the use of monolayer WO3  has great po-
tential to reduce the Pt noble metal usage on the catalyst fabrication).
In addition to the aforementioned non-noble metals, in the 2020s,
the  use  of  rare  earth  elements  (e.g.  La,  Y,  Ce,  and  Sc)  as  SACs  were
proposed. It is anticipated that the multi-shell electrons of the rare earth
metals  will  lead  to  strong  adhesive  bonding  between  the  rare  earth
element and a support material [89]. Strong metal-support interactions
are favorable as they have been found to reduce the chance of atoms
aggregation, a common problem during the synthesis of SACs. In other
words,  it  can  promote  scalable  mass  production  of  SACs.  To-date,
yttrium,  scandium,  and  praseodymium-based  SACs  (Y1,  Pr1  and  Sc1)
have  been  tested  for  N2  and  CO2  reduction  reactions  [89,90];  while
erbium SACs (Er1) have been tested for the effective photocatalytic CO2
reduction [91]. On the other hand, the impact of integrating a second
metal  species  into  a  SAC  has  also  started  to  get  more  attention  from
researchers. It is believed that such bimetallic catalysts can offer better
catalytic  performance  than  that  of  monometallic  catalysts  given  the
synergetic effect between the two metal species [90,92]. Evidently, the
bimetallic  Ir1Mo1/TiO2  SAC  synthesized  in  a  recent  work  [92],  is
capable  of  offering  a  greater  selectivity  (>96%)  for  a  hydrogenation
process, as opposed to the low selectivity of their monometallic forms (i.
e.,  less  than  40%  for  Ir1/TiO2  catalysts  and  negligible  activity  for

Mo1/TiO2 catalysts). A similar strength of bimetallic SAC has also been
discovered  by  Kaiser  and  co-workers  [93].  The  addition  of  Pt  single
atoms into the Au SAC can inhibit the sintering effect up to 800 K, which
eventually leads  to a 2-fold  increment in catalysts’  shelf life.  The po-
tential of such bimetallic SAC has been investigated for hydrogenation
(e.g. Ir1Mo1/TiO2 catalysts [92]; Pt1Sn1/N-doped carbon [94]), HER (e.
g. Ru1Pt1/N-doped carbon catalysts [95]; Ni1Co1/N-doped carbon cat-
alysts  [96]),  Fenton  reaction  (e.g.  hyaluronic  acid-coated  Fe1Co1/N--
doped  carbon  catalysts  [97]),  acetylene  hydrochlorination  (e.g.
Pt–Au-based bimetallic SAC [93]) and dichlorination (e.g. Fe1Cu1/N--
doped  porous  carbon  catalysts  [98]).  Meanwhile,  some  studies  have
focused on the versatile and scalable techniques for the mass production
of SACs, e.g. dry ball milling [99,100], pyrolysis [60], one-pot pyrolysis
[101], incipient wetness impregnation [49], anti-Ostwald method [30],
photochemical strategy [102], thermal emitting strategy [103], cascade
anchoring strategy [104], surface organometallic chemistry [105], and
electrochemical deposition [106]. Some of those even focus on exploring
ways  to  realize  ultrahigh  metal  loading  for  SAC  (e.g.  10–20  wt%  Ru
catalysts  [107],  >20  wt%  Cu1-based  SACs  [108,109],  >20  wt%
Co1-based  SACs  [110]),  where  most  synthesis  methods  are  through
thermal processing (e.g., pyrolysis [65,111] and annealing [108]).

Fig. 3(a) and (b) present the accumulative journal publications be-
tween 2011 and 2020, which directly relate to SAC research. Interest-
ingly,  China  and  the  United  States,  the  top  publication  hubs  for  SAC
research, collectively account for 67.1% of the total scholarly outputs. It
is then followed by Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Canada,
the  United  Kingdom,  Germany,  and  Spain,  with  a  relatively  gentle
annual growth in publication numbers. In terms of patent applications,
China has the largest patent filing numbers (>90% of the total patent
filed) thus far, based on the European Patent Office (EPO), and World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) databases, as shown in Fig. 3
(c)  and  (d).  All  the  afore-presented  trends  have  evidently  shown  the
growing interest and potential in SAC research and development. This
review paper, therefore, attempts to provide useful insights related to
the  development  of  SACs,  to  pave  the  way  for  potential  future  SAC
research,  especially  for  applications  in  the  field  of  clean  energy.  The
review  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  outlines  the  synthesis  and
fabrication methods, specially designed for SACs. Whereas the charac-
terization methods used in SAC research are discussed in Section 3. This
is followed by current SAC state-of-the-art applications as well as the
respective  up-scaling  challenges  highlighted  in  Sections  4  and  5,
respectively. It is then rounded up by a concluding remark in Section 6.

2. Synthetic routes towards single atom catalysts

A single atom catalyst comprises highly dispersed single atoms of a
metallic species onto a support material. However, innovative synthesis
methods  are  needed  given  the  thermodynamically  instable  nature  of
single atoms, so that the agglomeration phenomena during the synthesis
and reaction processes (as surface free energy is lower in metal cluster
form as compared to single atoms form [117]) can be avoided, if not, be
reduced  [118].  The  description  of  these  methods  is  presented  in  the
following sub-sections, where some of the respective key remarks are
summarized in Table 1.

2.1. Conventional synthesis methods

2.1.1. The co-precipitation method

Co-precipitation  is  a  classical  method  used  for  the  synthesis  of
nanoparticle (NP) based catalysts by precipitating the metal in the form
of hydroxide from a salt precursor with the aid of a base[119] (see Fig. 4
(a)). In 2011, Qiao et al. successfully produced the Pt SAC by dispersing
the  Pt  atoms  onto  defects  in  FeOx  [19].  This  was  carried  out  via  the
co-precipitation  of  aqueous  ferric  nitrate  (1  mol/L)  and  hexa-
chloroplatinic acid (0.076 mol/L) with sodium carbonate (1 mol/L). The
co-precipitation was conducted at 50
C and at pH 8. To mitigate the

H2/He at 473
C for 0.5 h. The resultant SACs were proven to demon-
strate remarkable stability and reactivity for CO oxidation. In addition to
CO oxidation, the co-precipitation strategy has been applied to synthe-
size  effective  SACs  for  the  WGS  reaction  [24],  NO  reduction  [38],
electrooxidation  catalysis  [148],  CO2  activation  [149]  and  carbon-
–carbon (C–C) coupling reactions [150]. However, due to the require-
ment of using low metal loadings (<1%) the capabilities of supported
SACs are limited  as metal oxide supports are not suitable  for electro-
chemical testing [151]. There are other common pitfalls associated with
the co-precipitation method, such as it being (a) time consuming, (b) not
suitable for reactants that have a significant difference in precipitation
rates, (c) trace impurities may be precipitated together with the desired
product [152], and (d) some metal atoms are anchored in the carrier
interface which makes it unable to serve as an active site for the catalytic
reaction [118,122].

2.1.2.

Impregnation method

Impregnation  is  a  widely  used  and  standard  method  of  producing
supported nanoparticles due to its simple execution, low waste genera-
tion, and cost effectiveness [155]. In general, this method starts with the
dispersion of an aqueous solution, containing metal precursors, onto a
support material. The mixture is then dried and calcined to anchor the
metal atoms onto the support, be that in defect sites, onto the surface, or
into  the  porous  network  of  a  mesoporous  material,  this  process  is
depicted  in  Fig.  4(d).  There  are  two  iterations  of  the  impregnation
method, including wet impregnation (excess amount of solution is used;
recycling is needed to mitigate waste [121]) and dry impregnation (also
name as incipient wetness impregnation (IWI); which requires a lower
solution volume but it is difficult to ensure uniform dispersion of metal
atoms  on  the  support  [122]).  For  instance,  Choi  et  al.  [49],  the  pio-
neered  work  which  synthesized  Pt1/zeolite-templated  carbon  via  a
wetness impregnation protocol. In their work, the mixture of carbon and

C for
3 h. As a result, SACs with a relatively high Pt loading (5 wt%) were
synthesized.  In  another  attempt  from  Yang  and  co-workers  [48],  Pt
atoms have been found to atomically disperse on TiN under a low metal
loading of  0.35 wt% using the dry impregnation  approach. Note  that
higher metal loadings could lead to the formation of NPs or clusters due
to atom agglomeration. It is postulated that this could be due to a weak
precursor–support  interaction  [49].  To-date,  SACs  derived  from
impregnation methods have been applied to oxygen reduction [48,49],
formic  acid  and  methanol  oxidation  [48],  formaldehyde  oxidation
[156], and CO oxidation [157].

2.1.3. Strong Electrostatic Adsorption

Strong  electrostatic  adsorption  (SEA)  is  a  special  type  of  wet
impregnation in which the pH of the solution is adjusted to maximize the
electrostatic interaction between metal precursors and the oxide surface
[123]  (Fig.  4(b)).  It  is  anticipated  that  the  oxide  surface  will  be  pro-
tonated (i.e., positively charged) under a pH condition lower than the
point  of  zero  charge  (PZC;  pH  condition  that  led  to  zero  interactions
between  metal  precursor  and  support);  while  it  is  deprotonated  (i.e.,
negatively charged) under a pH condition higher than the point of zero
charge [121,158]. Taking advantage of this feature, monolayers of O
,
OH, and OH2+
can be formed by controlling the pH values of the solu-
tion, which further results in the capability of anchoring varied metal
precursors onto the support [159]. Note that the ligand that connects the
metal  precursor  with  the  surface  will  be  removed  during  calcination
[160]. Using the study performed by DeRita and co-workers [153] for
example, SEA is used to enhance the adsorption of Pt atoms onto the
TiO2  surface.  By  controlling  the  pH  at  12.2  (greater  than  PZC),  the
surface will be deprotonated and thus, attract the metal ion complexes of
the  precursor  (i.e.,  [(NH3)4Pt]2+
).  The  ligand  can  then  be  removed
through calcination to form a SAC [159]. In 2019, a US research group
has attempted to synthesize a Pt1/SiO2@Al2O3  via SEA with the use of
H2PtCl6 as the Pt-precursor [158]. Interestingly, given that the metal ion
(cid:0)
complexes  (PtCl6
)  are  carrying  negative  charges,  the  Pt  atom  are
adsorbed at a pH lower than PZC instead. Some other successful SEA

applications  for  SAC  synthesis  include  Pt1/CeO2  [160,161]  and

Pt1)/hydroxyapatite  [163];  and  Ni1/hydroxyapatite  for  dry  methane
reforming  [164]. Nevertheless, the metal loadings of the SAC synthe-
sized from SEA method are usually kept low (<5wt%) [125]. Besides,
the  adsorption  behavior  is  highly  sensitive  to  the  types  of  functional
groups and the presence of defects on the support surface [124]. This is
problematic since this method is heavily dependent on the electrostatic
interaction to achieve atomic dispersion on the support surface.

2.1.4. Ball-milling

The ball-milling method, or the so-called mechanochemistry strat-
egy, has gained interest in the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts due
to its (a) efficiency to homogeneously mix multiple precursors together
[165]; and (b) is simple to scale-up [126]. In the early discovery of SACs,
the ball-milling method, Fig. 4(c) was been proposed by Deng et al. [99]
to  synthesize FeN4/graphene  nanosheets. During the  ball-milling pro-
cess, kinetic energy is used to break the chemical bonds of the substrates
as well as the macrocyclic structure of the added metal–ligand complex,
slowly at 450 rpm for 20 h [99,166], while the shearing action of the

milling process is known to generate a large amount of heat which can
thermally  decompose  organic  molecules  [167].  The  resultant  com-
pounds such as FeN4 or CoN4 then interact with the defect sites of gra-
phene  that  were  formed  during  the  ball-milling  process,  to  form  the
desired SACs. Similar to other methods mentioned, the metal loadings
must  be  kept  low  (~2.7  wt%)  to  avoid  agglomeration  of  the
high-surface-energy metal atoms [168]. Nevertheless, such an approach
possesses limited scalability that is required, this is due to (a) unique
precursors which are usually expensive and not commercially available
(e.g., metallophthalocyanine); and (b) specific operational conditions (e.
g., under argon atmosphere) [127]. Therefore, the ball milling-assisted
approach  which  is  coupled  with  calcination  (or  other  thermal  treat-
ments)  approach  has  recently  attracted  more  attention  from  research
groups  [100,169].  Recently,  kg-scale  fabrication  of  noble  atom-based
SACs has been successfully demonstrated in the work developed by He
et  al.  [169].  In  this  work,  the  noble  metal  precursor  Pd(acac)2  and
support precursors Zn(acac)2 were mixed at a weight ratio of 1:400 and
subsequently distributed into four agate grinding jars. Each jar contains
50 grinding balls of 6 mm diameter and 20 with a 10 mm diameter. The
mixtures were ground for 10 h at a speed of 400 rpm. To note, the use of
the acac ligand generally aids the anchoring process of the metal pre-
cursors into the bulk support during the ball-milling process [169]. The
resulting  milled  mixtures  were  calcined  at  400
C  for  2  h.  He  and
co-workers  [169]  have  successfully  produced  Pd1/ZnO,  Ru1/ZnO,
Rh1/ZnO, and Pd1/CuO via the afore-proposed procedure. Interestingly,
no significant scaling-up effect was observed as the kg-scale, Pd1/ZnO
exhibits almost the same catalytic performance (about 92% styrene yield
via hydrogenation of phenylacetylene) as compared to the small-scale
fabrication (10 g-scale) under the same conditions (10 mg of catalyst
and 0.5 mmol of phenylacetylene were used, the reaction was conducted
◦
for 20 min at a temperature of 50
C) The ball-milling method has been
successfully applied to the fabrication of SACs for oxidation of benzene
[99], hydrogenation of acetylene [170], phenylacetylene [169], 2-meth-
yl-3-butyn-2-ol [171], glycerol hydrogenolysis [172], organic pollutant
degradation [173], Fenton-like reaction [174], HER [175], ORR [176,
177], CO oxidation [169], and photoreaction [128]. Nevertheless, (a)
restricted  scalability  especially  for  co-catalyst  synthesis  which  inevi-
tably involves liquid-phase processes [128]; and (b) the occurrence of
metallic impurities from the machinery on the catalysts are the other
common weaknesses of this approach [178].

2.1.5. Atomic layer deposition

Atomic  Layer  Deposition  (ALD)  is  another  prominent  synthetic
technique  for  the  fabrication  of  SACs  given  its capability  to  precisely
control the atomic deposition, dispersion of metal species and coating
thickness  [27,129].  This  strength  makes  it  a  prominent  approach
particularly  for  studying  the  insights  on  SAC synthesis  [122]  and  the
influences of various parameters involved in the synthetic processes [14,
122]. Generally, a complete cycle of ALD encompasses two main steps,
shown  in  Fig.  4(e).  In  the  first  step,  metal  precursors  such  as
methylcyclopentadienyl-trimethylplatinum  (MeCpPtMe3)  will  react
with oxygen atoms which were adsorbed onto the substrate’s surface.
The subsequent O2 exposure was oxidized into the metal precursors and
thus, form a new adsorbed O2  layer on top of the metal surface (met-
al–oxygen (M(cid:0) O) species). In a complete cycle, the surface of the sup-
port is exposed to a 1 s pulse of metal precursor, followed by 20 s pulse of
N2 to purge the system and then a 5 s pulse of O2, continually. To note,
the metal loading can be finely tuned by altering the number of ALD
cycles,  e.g.,  Pt  loading  of  2.1  wt%  or  7.6  wt%  on  N-doped  graphene
nanosheets  can  be  achieved  via  50  and  100  ALD  cycles,  respectively
[179]; 150 ALD cycles can increase the Pt loading on graphene to 10.5
wt% [27]. Thus far, ALD has been applied to generate Pt-graphene SACs
for the methanol oxidation reaction [27], an N-doped graphene support
for HER [179], and a CeO2  support for CO oxidation [180]. This syn-
thetic procedure has now been extended to synthesize Pd and Fe-based
SACs  [36,181].  In  a  recent  work  conducted  by  Zhang  et  al.  [182],  a

(cid:0) 2 and 1.24 μg cm

Pt–Ru bimetallic catalyst fabricated using the ALD method has proven to
provide 50 times higher reactivity for HER as compared to a commercial
Pt  catalyst  (Pt  mass  loadings  for  bimetallic  catalysts  and  commercial
(cid:0) 2, respectively). On the other
catalysts are 61.2 μg cm
hand,  the  Pd1/graphene  catalysts  produced  via  the  ALD  method  are
capable of achieving 100% butene selectivity, up to 95% conversion in
the  selective  hydrogenation  of  1,3-butadiene  conversion,  where  the
attained selectivity to 1-butene (the desired product which can be used
as co-monomer in polyethylene production) was more than 70% [36].
This  is  superior as  compared with conventional  Pd/C  catalysts which
routinely  achieve  ~60%  selectivity,  at  the  same  conversion.  Other
to-date applications of ALD include, but are not limited to Co1-modified
Pt nanoparticles catalysts for ORR [183], Ru1/PtNi catalysts for meth-
anol oxidation [184]. However, the ALD process is slow and demands
greater energy consumption, as well as requiring an ultraclean surface
[185].  All  these  compounded  issues  lead  to  a  higher  fabrication  cost
[127]. Together with the low stability of the synthesized SAC [122,131],
both serve as the key factors that need to be considered under large-scale
production [186].

2.1.6. Chemical etching

◦

Chemical etching is a convenient and straightforward method to re-
disperse nanoparticles on substrates as single atoms. Contrary to other
synthesis approaches where monoatomic particles are embedded onto
the substrate as a “bottom-up” approach, the chemical etching strategy
is a “top-down”  approach where larger clusters are first embedded on
the  substrate  and  then  redistributed  as  single  atoms  [142].  As  an
example, Feng et al. [187] prepared nanoparticles of Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir,
and Pt on an activated carbon support, respectively. Chemical etching
was performed using a mixture of CO and CH3I at 240
C for 6 h. The
dispersion of Rh nanoparticles to single atom was studied, and the work

fully  synthesized  single-atom  vacancy  catalysts  to  improve  the  HER
performance,  showing  that  S-vacancies  provided  an  effective  surface
electronic  structure  for  boosted  electrical  transport  properties.
Few-layer  Ti3–xC2Ty  nanosheets  [189]  are  first  prepared  by  etching
Ti3AlC2 in a solution of lithium fluoride and hydrochloric acid. From this
process, some Ti atoms will be ripped off, and when [PtCl6]2- complex
ions are stirred with the nanosheets, Pt4+
ions will be adsorbed onto the
surface,  forming  a  SAC.  Collective  researchers  from  both  Chen  and
Tang’s laboratory [143] also demonstrated that nanoparticle graphene
with doped Ni can be chemically etched by HCl solution, causing the
structure of Ni nanoparticles to be inherited by the graphene. With an
etching time of less than 6 h, Ni SACs have been identified via Selected
Area  Electron  Diffraction  (SAED)  and  High-Resolution  Transmission
Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).

2.1.7. Deposition–precipitation strategy

Using  the  deposition–precipitation  strategy,  a  metal  solution  is
mixed and reacted with support molecules to form a uniform suspension.
The reaction temperature and pH are precisely controlled to deposit the
metal species on the support [144], forming SACs. This technique was
popular  for  oxide  support,  for  example,  Fu  et  al.  [190]  synthesized
Au-ceria SAC via the dropwise addition of HAuCl4 into the suspension of
ceria particles in an aqueous solution of (NH4)2CO3  at a pH of 8. The
deposition–precipitation strategy was gradually extended for different
SACs, such as Wang et al. [145], who studied Au/Sn–TiO2, concluding
that the creation of oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface by single-site
Sn had led to better selective activation. For this, Zhang et al. [145] also
mentioned  that  when  oxygen  defects  are  generated  via  the  deposi-
tion–precipitation method, the metal species precursor can be reduced
to  form  single  metal  atoms.  Mochizuki  et  al.  [191]  demonstrated  the
preparation of Au1/NiO SACs by the deposition–precipitation strategy
by  mixing  and  calcination  of  HAuCl4  and  NiO
support.
Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM was used to directly observe Au single

tion–precipitation strategy with UV irradiation of the titania support in
ethanol. Excess Au loadings were also removed using sodium cyanide,
leaving atomically dispersed Au on titania. This shows that the deposi-
tion–precipitation strategy is a versatile method for even when an excess
of metal loading was introduced, removal is possible.

2.2. Novel synthesis methods

2.2.1. Surface organometallic chemistry and coordination site strategy

ligand)

The interaction between single metal atoms and the surface atoms of
support materials decides the nature of the catalyst stability. The coor-
dination  site  strategy  assigns  support  sites  with  chemical  linkers  to
adsorb or bind metal atoms, preventing migration and agglomeration
[132]. One of the most common synthesis methods for a SAC is to use
specialized N-based linkers, exploiting coordinate bonds or N-binding to
implant  single  atoms  into  a  larger  matrix  such  as  in  a  metal–organic
framework. Recently, Gong et al. [193] used polypyrrole (PPy) mole-
cules  as  N2-based  linkers,  which  can  fill  into  the  1D  channel  of  a
/Ni2+
(non-nitrogenous) MOF (constructed by divalent Mg2+
ions and 2,

◦
then annealed at 900
C to anchor the N atoms from PPy onto a porous
carbon  composite,  followed  by  the  thermal  decomposition  of  PPy
(removing  the  carbon  from  MOF  linkage).  This  ultimately  forms  a
high-performance NiSA-N2-C electrocatalyst that has been used for the
reduction of CO2  to CO [193]. For the application of an H2  evolution
photocatalyst, Li et al. [51] used a liquid-phase reaction with g-C3N4 and
H2PtCl6, followed by  low-temperature annealing. This procedure  syn-
thesized a Pt/g-C3N4  SAC. Here, FT-EXAFS was used to deduce a coor-
dination number of 5, which suggests that Pt single atoms were bonded
on the top of the five-membered rings of the C3N4  network. The pho-
tocatalyst was able to give a high H2 generation rate of 162.8–318 μmol
(cid:0) 1 with a Pt loading content from 0.075 to 0.16 wt%. In general, most
h
works [132,194] implement this strategy by ushering the single atom
onto  coordinated  sites  with  a  chemical  linker,  followed  by  a  thermal
method and other post-treatment to remove and carbonize unrequired
synthetic  reagents.  The  most  critical  variable  for  controlling  the  syn-
thesis of SACs using this strategy is the concentration of the metal pro-
ducing  the  single  atoms  and  the  annealing  temperature  [51].  A
well-established  coordination  strategy  known  as  surface  organome-
tallic  coordination  (SOMCs)  from  coordination  compounds  has  been
developed  to  produce  single-site  atom  catalysts  [105].  During  the
grafting  of  SOMCs,  several  fragments  of  reaction  intermediates  are
linked  to  a  surface-supported  metal  (e.g.,  Metal-M;  M(cid:0) H,  M–R,  M  =
CR2, M = O, M = NR, M–O–OR), enabling direct access of the metal atom
to the surface. Cop ́eret [195] has reported that the selective formation of
isolated  sites  of  metal  via  SOMF  on  a  heterogeneous  catalyst  is  more
favorable  than  via  wetness  impregnation  methods,  which  favor  the
formation of larger nanoparticles or clusters. He also demonstrated that
a single-site heterogeneous catalyst can be prepared using SOMC com-
bined with thermolytic molecular precursors (TMP). These TMP can be
removed  readily  upon  thermal  treatment,  giving  a  high  flexibility
SOMC/TMP  procedure  to  engineered  heterogeneous  catalysts.  For
instance,  few  well-defined  isolated  site  based  SACs  (e.g.  Cr(III)  sup-
ported on Al2O3) have been developed by the combination of SOMC and
thermolytic  molecular  precursors  (TMPs),  yielding  a  greater  catalytic
activity,  selectivity  and  stability  of  Al2O3  than  the  Cr(III)/Al2O3  bulk
catalyst [196]. In 2017, a combination of SOMC and ALD approach was
being  developed  by  Liu  to  produce  a  SAC  with  uniform  nuclearity
Pt/Al2O3 [197]. By pairing the ALD strategy for mitigating agglomera-
tion, the Pt organometallic complexes can remain monatomic even upon
high-temperature  thermal  treatments  and  post ligand  removal  (Fig.  5
(b). Notably, the Pt/Al2O3 SAC does not exhibit any thermal sintering,

◦

C, whereas samples without ALD overcoats exhibited sig-
even at 400
nificant particle agglomeration under similar conditions. Alternatively,
there  were  also  efforts  to  synthesize  SACs  for  hydrogenation  via  less
energy  intensive  SOMC  (without  subsequent  thermal  treatment).  An
ultra-low Pt single loading (~1 wt%) was coordinated on phosphomo-
lybdic acid (PMA)-modified active carbon [198]. The Pt SAC was syn-
thesized by anchoring Pt on the four-fold planar geometry on PMA. The
hydrogenation of N–O, C––O, C––C, and C–––
C groups were studied, and
the  Pt-PMA/AC  SAC  exhibited  comparable  or  better  turnover  fre-
quencies (TOF) compared to a conventional Pt/AC catalyst. This dem-
onstrates  that  single  atoms  have  the  potential  to  be  anchored  into
organometallic  compounds,  which  stabilizes  the  SAC  structure  while
providing high catalytic activity.

2.2.2. Defect design strategy

Poorly defined vacancy defects on ordered support may lead to dif-
ficulties  in  identifying  and  controlling  the  precise  structure  of  the
attained SAC. Therefore, a defect design strategy aims to engineer the
defects  on  a  support  to  stabilize  the  SAC  surface,  allowing  a  higher
possible metal loading, providing a large number of individual active
sites, as well as improve the selectivity of the desired process [133]. One
of the directions followed has led to a number of works being carried out
to study  the effect of O2  vacancies  in mixed metal oxides to stabilize
active  sites  [200,201].  Additionally,  vacancy  defects  on  graphene  or
layered materials have been probed in a similar way [202,203], as well
as, heteroatom defects in crystals, cation and anion vacancies [204,205].
Shen and co-authors [206] demonstrated that defects in graphene can
alter  the  charge  distribution  on  a  carbon  plane,  giving  evidence  that
graphite with more exposed edges can provide superior electrocatalytic
performance. Apart from the carbon-based materials, other defect-rich
oxide materials also were used as supports in the synthesis of SACs (e.
g., CoO [207], TiO2  [199], and CeO2  [208]). Wang et al. [207] have
employed an adsorption method to prepare an Rh-based SAC (Rh/CoO),
which was stabilized in the defect sites on the surface of CoO nanosheets
through the electrostatic interaction. The developed Rh/CoO SAC dis-
played higher selectivity toward propene hydroformylation to butyral-
dehyde compared to Rh/bulk-CoO. TiO2 is also another suitable support
for SAC preparation that has abundant defective sites. From Fig. 5 (c), a
wrap-bake-peel synthetic strategy to fabricate an enzyme-like Cu-based
SAC  supported  on  the  TiO2  was  proposed  by  Lee  et  al.  [199].  The
amorphous TiO2 was first coated on SiO2 core before the Cu atoms were
adsorbed on the amorphous surface. Then, a second layer SiO2 coating
was introduced to form the SiO2–TiO2–Cu1–SiO2  core(cid:0) shell materials
with  a  sandwich-like  structure.  Subsequent  steps  such  as  calcination,
baking,  and  NaOH  leaching  were  performed  to  ensure  the  single  Cu
atoms were located at the Ti sites of anatase TiO2. This synthetic strategy
gas facilitated a valence control of co-catalyst Cu atoms and generated a
reversible  valence  change  in  photoactivation  that  enhance  photo-
catalytic hydrogen generation activity.

2.2.3. High temperature-induced strategy

It  was  widely  known  that higher  thermal  stability  of  SACs can  be
granted by fabricating the catalysts under higher temperatures since the
precursor–support  interaction  will  be  enhanced  under  high  tempera-
tures  [134].  Some  of  the  state-of-art  techniques  reported  are  strong
metal-support  interaction  (SMSI)  promoted  production  [125],  the
non-defect stabilized approach [133], and the high thermal redispersion
approach [209].

For instance, based on a work  published in 2015, the single atom
active sites on a support can be formed SMSI approach during pyrolysis
[60].  It  is  attractive  due  to  its  capability  in  yielding  SACs  with  good
metal dispersion although in higher metal loadings (5–20 wt%) [101,
210].  Cheng  et  al.  [210]  reported
the
pyrolysis-assisted method in fabricating a series of atomically dispersed
transition metals (M refers Ni, Co, NiCo, CoFe, and NiPt) on N-doped
carbon nanotubes with metal loading of 20±4 wt%. Findings showed

that  the  M  single-atom/N-doped  carbon  nanotube  fabricated  via  a
pyrolysis-assisted method exhibited outstanding catalytic performance
not only on ORR and  HER but also in electrochemical  CO2  reduction
[101,211].  In  general,  the  pyrolysis-assisted  method  consists  of  three
general steps, (a) mixing of metal and support precursors, (b) pyrolysis,
and  (c)  post-treatment,  e.g.,  washing,  drying,  acid  treatment  (for
removal of residual unencapsulated metal or unwanted ligands). Taking
the deposition of Co1 on the N-doped carbon as an example (Fig. 6(a)),
the  first  step  was  to  prepare  the  catalysts  precursors  by  mixing  urea,
glucose, CoCl2⋅6H2O, NaSCN, and ethanol at room temperature. Then,
the mixture was treated with ultrasonic treatment to form a homoge-
neous mixture. It was subsequently, dried at 60
C for 8 h to remove
trace ethanol residues. The resultant solids were then ball-milled to form
the desired catalyst precursor. Next, the obtained materials were pyro-
◦
lyzed (>600
C), and subsequently cooled to room temperature under an
inert (N2) atmosphere. This resulted in the formation of Co1/N-doped
carbon SAC with a uniform distribution of Co atoms. Before the SACs can
◦
be used, it was cooled and treated in acid (0.5 M, H2SO4 at 80
C for 8 h)
to remove any non-coordinated Co atoms and precursor impurities. To
note,  the  yielded  Co1/N-doped  carbon  catalyst  possesses  the  greatest
catalytic  activities  for  ORR  and  HER  as  compared  to  the  other  two
conventional  catalysts  (Pt/C  catalysts  and  Co/N-doped  carbon  cata-
lysts), as well as excellent reusability where there was no degradation
after 11,000 continuous catalytic cycles [211]. Recently, pyrolysis was
also used as an efficient tool to downsize metal from the range of 100–1
nm. Based on the findings discovered by Wei et al. [134], the sintering

and atomization occurred during the pyrolysis of metal-NP (i.e., Pd, Pt,
Au), where atomization (i.e., the transformation of metal-NP to SA) took
place  at  high  temperature  (900–1000
C);  whereas  sintering  was
C.  This  represents  an  attractive
observed  between  300  and  1000
top-down synthesis path to derive SACs from a metal NP. In fact, the
pyrolysis-assisted approach appeared to be promising for the synthesis
of SACs with ultra-high metal loading (>20 wt%) [65,111].

Aside from this, a recent method  to synthesize single-atom metals
from bulk metals on the catalyst surface using high temperatures were
also being developed [214]. This thermal emitting strategy provided an

nano-catalyst from their bulk materials. Qu and co-authors [214] have
used pyrolysis at 900
C to create Zn nodes and defect sites on a pyro-
lyzed  zeolitic  imidazolate  framework-8  (ZIF-8).  Then,  a  Cu  foam  was
reacted with NH3  gas to form Cu(NH3)x. These Cu(NH3)x  species were
then  trapped  by  the  defects  in  the  pyrolyzed  N-rich  carbon  support,
which forms the Cu-single atom N-rich carbon support (Cu–SAs/N–C)
catalyst. The work also showed that Co or Ni could be used to replace the
Cu bulk metal, confirming its application towards a wide range of SAC
syntheses.  Later,  Qu and  co-authors  [103]  used  this thermal  emitting
strategy to synthesize a high-performance Pt-SAC on defective graphene
(Pt–SAs/DG) (Fig. 6(b)). For this synthesis dicyandiamide (DCD) and Pt
dispersed on graphene oxide (GO) were placed under Ar flow and heated
to 1100
C. At this temperature the DCD underwent pyrolysis, gener-
ating NH3 gas. Due to the strong coordination interaction between NH3
and Pt atoms, the volatile Pt(NH3)x species was formed. The Pt entities

species. After that, O content from the GO was removed through thermal
processing to produce graphene with defects (DG). Lastly, the isolated Pt

SAs/DG catalysts were formed by trapping the Pt
on the DG. Notably, the prepared Pt–SAs/DG catalyst demonstrated high
activity for HER and selective oxidation of various organosilanes. This
demonstrates that even the surface of the catalyst can be freely changed
by using the thermal emitting strategy, giving a high potential for future
SAC synthesis on a large-scale production.

Zhao and co-authors [104] recently proposed a cascade anchoring
strategy to synthesize a SAC with a high-loading with the possibility for
large-scale  production.  The  work  demonstrates  that  the  cascade
anchoring  strategy  could  synthesize  metal-Nx  moieties,  anchored  on
carbon support (M(cid:0) NC) with flexibility for the metal atom. Moreover,
the metal loading for the synthesized catalyst was reported up to 12.1 wt
%. First, metal ions (e.g. Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, and Pt) were fixated
using a chelating agent (such as glucose). The isolated metal ions are
then  anchored  onto  the  O2-rich  porous  carbon  support  where  the
glucose can bind to the carbon support due to interaction with O-con-
taining  groups  (Fig.  6(c)).  Next,  the  compound  was  mixed  with  a  ni-
trogen  source  melamine,  and  pyrolyzed  over  600
C  to  react  the
carbon-N species with melamine to form a SAC with M-Nx  moieties. A
similar anchoring strategy using immobilization and pyrolysis was also
performed for the synthesis of Pt-single atoms on a commercial carbon
black, Black Pearls® 2000 (PtSA@BP) [215] for the HER reaction. This
work used a tetra(4-tert-butyl-phenyl)porphyrinato platinum (PtTBPP)
complex  as  the  N  and  Pt  precursor  while  simultaneously  providing  a
monodisperse  purpose.  The  molecules  achieved  porphyrin  adsorption

shockwave

Nevertheless,  SACs  synthesis  at  temperatures  >1000

C  is  still
challenging to be achieved via conventional strategies. To overcome this
technical barrier, two ultra-high temperature-assisted strategies, namely
the
the  high-temperature
high-temperature  arc-discharge  strategy  [213]  were  developed.  The
former method utilized periodic on-off shock heating (on-state temper-
◦
ature can achieve up to 2727
C; while the off-state period operates for
10x longer, leading to a lower average temperature of 127
C) to sta-
bilize  the  single  metal  atom  on  the  support.  This  makes  the  strategy
compatible with various materials. Yao and co-workers [212], for the
first time, synthesize Pt single atoms that are deposited on the CO2-ac-
tivated  carbon  nanofiber  via  a  high-temperature  shockwave  strategy.
The metal precursor, H2PtCl6 was dispersed on the carbon nanofiber and
subsequently subjected to the heating shockwave. Their studies revealed
that  the  dispersion  of  Pt  clusters  can be  eliminated  by  increasing  the
heating cycles (Fig. 6(d)). Interestingly, all the weak Pt–Pt bonds and
types 1–3 Pt–C bonds were transformed into stronger types 4–10 Pt–C
bonds after multiple cycles of shock heating, thus, resulting in higher
thermal stability.

◦

The latter strategy utilized high-temperature arc discharges to in-situ
form and stabilize Pt single atoms on molybdenum carbide (MoC) sup-
◦
port at a temperature up to 4000
C (higher than the limit of the former
strategy). To synthesize Pt1/MoC via this method, a mixture of Pt and Mo
powders was first prepared and filled into the anode-side graphite tube
(Fig.  6(e)). Whereas the  cathode is made  of a  pure graphite rod.  The
synthesis process begins when the arc starts to be generated from the arc
chamber. The entire process took tens of minutes (other methods take
hours  to  complete  the  synthesis)  which  makes  it  an  efficient  and

attractive fabrication tool. The resultant SACs exhibit excellent perfor-
mance and thermal stability for the hydrogenation of quinoline. How-
ever,  both  the  aforementioned  methods  are  still  in  their  infancy,  and
follow-up works are needed to upscale the overall synthesis process to
cope with the demands for mass production of SACs.

2.2.4. Other ingenious strategies

2.2.4.1. Freeze-drying assisted strategy. A freeze-drying method has also
gained interest from the catalysis community as it enables a large spe-
cific surface area of the support, while more importantly, the mobility of
the metal precursors can be mitigated simultaneously [135]. A few re-
searchers  have  therefore  incorporated  the  freeze-drying  process  into
SACs fabrication to better design and control metal precursor deposi-
tion. Taking a Co-based SAC as an example (Fig. 7(a)), Fei et al. [59]
mixed  the  metal  precursor  (CoCl2⋅6H2O)  and  support  precursor  (gra-
phene  oxide)  at  a  ratio  of  1:135.  The  mixture  was  then  sonicated  in
deionized  water,  and  subsequently  freeze-dried  for  24  h  to  produce
◦
brownish powders. Next, the powder was annealed at 750
C for several
hours to activate the Co1/N-doped graphene. The work has proven that
the obtained catalysts can work as effective HER catalysts under both
acidic  and  alkaline  environments. Thus  far,  the  freeze-drying  method
has  been  extended  to  create  Fe-based  SACs  for  ORR  [216]  and
Fenton-like reaction [217], Pd-based SACs for selective hydrogenation
[218]  and  Zn-air  batteries  application  [219],  Ni-based  SACs  for  CO2
methanation  [220],  Pt-based  SACs  for  HER  [221],  Co-based  SAC  for
lithium-sulfur  batteries  application  [222],  and  bimetallic  SACs  (e.g.,
Co1–Fe1-based  SACs  for  HER  [223]).  Despite  the  potential  of  having
greater reactivity and stability of catalysts as compared to the conven-
tional oven-drying approach [224], the high operational cost  still ap-
pears  as  one  of  the  main  conundrums  for  the  freeze-drying  assisted
strategy [136].

2.2.4.2. Photochemical  method. Photochemical  methods  rely  on  a
powerful light source (e.g. UV lights) to deposit single atoms on support
via ion reduction. In years gone by the photochemical method was used
for solar O2 production in metal deposition onto a semiconductor pho-
toanode [139]. For instance, the deposition of Co on a ZnO electrode in a
K3PO4–CoCl2  precursor solution under UV light emission to oxide the
Co2+
ions, adhering it to the ZnO surface142. This method was recently
adopted  into  Pt  SAC  preparation  by  Liu  et  al.  [102].  They  have  suc-
cessfully developed an “ultra-low” Pt loading and highly stable atomi-
cally dispersed Pd1/TiO2 SACs for catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes
(Fig.  7(b)). The  single  atom  Pt-loaded (up  to  1.5  wt% loadings)  TiO2
nanosheets  on  ethylene  glycolate  (EG)  were  synthesized  by  stepwise
removal by EG radicals
UV-induced radical formation which causes Cl
[102]. The adsorption of photons and electronically excited states were
reported to be the two key steps in the photochemical reduction process.
Later,  this  photochemical  method  was  used  to  synthesize  Pd-loaded
(001)-exposed  anatase  nanocrystals  and  Pd-loaded  TiO2  SACs  for  the
purpose  of  styrene  hydrogenation  and  CO  oxidation  [226].  For  solar
water  oxidation,  an  Ir  dinuclear  heterogeneous  catalyst  (DHC)  on  a
Fe2O3 surface was prepared by ultraviolet ozone (UVO) cleaner system,
providing  a  paradigm  for  SACs  with  multiple  active  sites  [227].  A
2(cid:0)
photochemical solid-phase synthesis method was used to adsorb PtCl6
onto an N-doped porous carbon and directly reduced by UV light to Pt
atoms  achieving  3.6  wt%  loadings  [228].  Another  novel  method  to
prevent  atom  nucleation  is  by  using  iced  photochemical  reduction
[225].  This  strategy  (Fig.  7(c))  coupled  with  the  freeze-drying  tech-
nique, freezes the atom-carrying aqueous solution before UV treatment
and  successfully  synthesizes  a  stable  SAC  with  Pt  atoms  on  various
support  (e.g.,  amorphous  carbons,  mesoporous  carbon,  graphene,
multi-walled carbon nanotubes, TiO2 NP, and ZnO nanowires) for HER.

widely  accepted  electrocatalyst  preparation  method  by  most  re-
searchers; this is because the metal ions can be easily deposited onto
cathodes in an electrolyte solution without any complicated procedure
[229].  Therefore,  it  is  one  of  the  attractive,  scalable,  facile,  and
cost-effective methods which is capable of synthesizing and activating
single atom electrocatalysts with the aid of electrochemical potential.
To-note, the size, and the respective metal loadings can be fine-tuned by
altering the deposition parameters such as metal ion concentration and
deposition  time  [140].  More  importantly,  the  SACs  derived  from  this
method  are  binder-free  that  can  be  used  directly  in  electrocatalysis
[140].  Some  works  have  proved  its  capability  in  SAC  fabrication.
Notably,  in  the  work  conducted  by  Fan  et  al.  [230],  the  formulated
Ni–C-based catalysts were successfully activated via the series of treat-
ment processes, i.e., HCl leaching treatment (for removal of redundant
Ni  metal)  and  electrochemical  cyclic-potential  treatment  (for  activa-
tion). Unexpectedly, throughout the entire activation process, Ni atoms
were atomically dispersed and anchored onto the carbon support, which
therefore formed Ni-based  SACs (Fig. 8(a)). On  the other hand,  some
works have attempted to in-situ grow the Pt single atoms onto Ni foam
[52],  single-walled  carbon  nanotubes  [231],  and  a  bismuth  ultra-
microelectrode [140]. Aside from that, Zhang et al. [232], for the first

time, proposed the use of the electrochemical method to synthesize an
atomic Pt and Co co-trapped carbon catalyst. Thus far, the SACs fabri-
cated  using  this  method  have  shown  superior  HER  activity  and  elec-
trocatalytic stability as compared to the conventional Pt/C (20 wt% Pt)
catalysts  (e.g.,  the  catalytic  activity  of  the  PtSA-NT-NF  catalysts  syn-
thesized  by  Zhang  et  al.  [52]  were  4  times  greater  than  that  of  Pt/C
catalysts). More recently, a self-terminating electrodeposition technique
for SACs fabrication was proposed [141]. Generally, by controlling the
electrical  potential  at  the  underpotential  deposition  (UPD)  state,  the
metal-support bonding can become dominant as compared to the met-
al–metal bonding, which favors the formation of SACs. The continuous
atom growth will be terminated once the surface-limited reaction has
reached saturation. This further ensures the formation of SACs instead of
metal clusters (Fig. 8(b)). More interestingly, it can be operated under
ambient temperature which makes it an energy-efficient SAC fabrication
method. Moreover, the two ultra-high temperature-assisted strategies (i.
e.  high  temperature  shockwave  strategy  and  the  high  temperature
arc-discharge strategy) presented in Section 2.2.3 can also be, arguably,
categorized as electrochemical methods as the use of electric fields was
involved.

soft-landing. The  mass-selected  soft-landing
2.2.4.4. Mass-selected
approach is an emerging technique for SAC synthesis. It starts with the
vaporization  of  metal  atoms  using  a  high-frequency  laser,  where  the
vaporized  metal  atoms  are  selected  by  a  mass  filter  to  control  the
deposition  of  the  metal  on  the  support  surface  [118,146]  (Fig.  9).
To-date,  since  this  method  is  capable  of  providing  exact  tuning  and
control of the size of metal deposited on the support surface, it has been
employed in a couple of SAC works for generating fundamental insights
[13,233].  For  example,  to  study  the  impact  of  Pt  atom  number  on
electrochemical  catalysis,  Weber  and  co-workers  [234]  have  synthe-
sized  Ptn/Indium  Tin  Oxide  (ITO)  catalysts  (1  = n  ≤ 14)  using  the
+
clusters (and
mass-selected soft-landing method. In their work, the Ptn
atoms) produced from the laser vaporization were channeled through a
quadrupole mass filter to generate a beam containing the desired cluster
(or  single  atom)  size  which  was  then  deposited  on  the  ITO  surface.
Earlier in 2000, one of the pioneering works [235] had also attempted to
verify the catalytic kinetics of Pdn/MgO(100) catalysts (1 = n ≤ 30) for

the  trimerization  reaction  using  a  mass-selected  soft-landing  method
where they found the SAC (Pd1/MgO(100)) can significantly reduce the
activation energy requirement. Aside from that, this approach has been
applied  to  synthesize  bimetallic  SACs  for  OER  and  ORR  [236];
Pt1/glassy carbon substrate catalysts for ORR [237]; Pd1/TiO2 catalysts
for CO oxidation [238]; and Au1/TiO2 catalysts for CO oxidation [239].
Nonetheless,  the  need  for  ultrahigh  vacuum  conditions  and  low  pro-
duction yields has inevitably lowered the scalability of this method [13,
118].

3. Characterization methods

The  existence  and  spatial  distribution  of  isolated  single  atoms  are
crucial for understanding the relationships between structures and the
properties in SACs. However, it is quite challenging to identify the single
atoms at an atomic-scale due to the requirement of high spatial resolu-
tion tools. In recent decades, techniques have been developed towards
an atom-scale resolution that can be employed to the SACs at different
ensemble level signals, of all responsive species, which can minimize the
deceptive  information  and  accurately  reflect  the  real  active  atomic
species.  Hereby,  in  this  section,  we  provide  an  overview  of  various
advanced characterization techniques for SACs, which can be classified
into several categories: (a) High-resolution electron microscopy, (b) X-
ray irradiation spectroscopy, (c) in situ spectroscopy, and (d) magnetic
resonance spectroscopy.

3.1. High-resolution electron microscopies

3.1.1. High angle annular dark field microscopy

With  the  development  of  advanced  microscopes,  the  direct  obser-
vation of NPs or atoms in/on catalyst supports has been realized. With
the aid of different electron microcopies such as Aberration-Corrected
High  Angle  Annular  Dark  Field/Scanning  Transmission  Electron  Mi-
croscopy (AC-HAADF/STEM), the fine distributions and precise location
of  single  atoms  in  the  catalyst  can  be  evaluated,  differentiated  using
bright and dark field imaging.

Transmission  electron  microscopy  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used
characterization methods to determine the structure and particle size of

active sites in heterogeneous catalysts. It provides a clear observation of
the  catalyst  morphology  and  structural  change  before  and  after  in-
teractions  between  metal  atoms  and  supports  [240,241].  Lately,  the
improvement of spatial resolution in electron microscopes has granted
the possibility of identifying the active sites of SACs at a single  atom
level. Specifically, HAADF-STEM is one of the high-end techniques in
which  the  high  angle  annular  dark  field  imagery  is  coupled  with  a
standard  scanning  transmission  electron  microscope  to  provide  the
bright/dark contrast of different elements at a sub-angstrom level res-
olution [242]. For HAADF-STEM, the intensity of images obtained fol-
lows  the  thickness  of  samples  and  the  atomic  number  up  to  an
exponential value of 1.4–2, but still, it is not powerful enough to identify
the isolated single atoms in a SAC [243]. To improve the precision, the
aberration-corrected  HAADF-STEM  is  often  used  to  distinguish  the
atoms from the support materials based on their different values and,
further provide direct evidence of the existence of SACs [244,245]. For
example,  Qiao  et  al.  [19]  reported  about  Pt/FeOx  catalysts  and
demonstrated how individual Pt atoms uniformly dispersed on a FeOx
surface using HAADF-STEM (Fig. 10(a)). Both individual Fe (Fig. 10(b))
and Ir (Fig. 10(c)) atoms can be clearly distinguished from other lighter
metal atoms (highlighted by red circles) such as Si, Al, Na, C and O [246,
247]. However, there is also a shortcoming where the isolated atoms in
the images are not clearly shown due to the phase contrast caused by the
multiple metal loadings, impurities, and the inhomogeneity of substrates
(e.g. lighter elements are usually invisible when imaged together with
heavier, differences in contrast). Thus, Electron Energy Loss Spectros-
copy (EELS) or Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) are often
combined  with  HAADF-STEM  to  provide  an  in-depth  insight  into  the
catalyst [246]. Based on this method, metal atoms (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni) can
be  clearly  distinguished  from  the  carbon-supported  SACs  via  STE-
M/EDX, where metal atoms are reported to be stabilized by the carbon
surface [59,246,248] (Fig. 10(d)). However, when the atomic number of
single  metal  atoms  and  supports  are  close,  it  will  be  challenging  to
obtain  obvious  contrast  in  HAADF-STEM  [249].  In  recent  work,  Guo
et al. [250] prepared the Cu/Al2O3 SAC with a high loading of 8.7 wt%,
but there were only a few Cu single atoms observed by HAADF-STEM
owing to the weak image contrast of Cu and Al2O3. Hence, coupling of

HAADF-STEM with other in-situ spatial resolution synchrotron charac-
terization techniques is value-added to probe the structural information
of the SAC (i.e, HAADF-STEM-Syn Infrared and HAADF-STEM-Syn X-ray
Diffraction).

3.1.2. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy

C to around 1027

Another persuasive technique for directly observing the SAC struc-
ture  is  by  using Scanning  Tunneling  Microscopy  (STM),  in  which  the
surface  images  of  the  conducting  or  semiconducting  materials  at  the
atomic level can be attained [251,252]. The typical advantage of STM is
to in-situ track the reaction process on a well-defined surface and pro-
vides the opportunity to explore catalytic mechanisms in real time [253,
254].  STM  operates  under  ultra-high  vacuum  at  the  broadband  tem-
perature range from near (cid:0) 273
C [255,256]. Over
the  decades, STM  has been widely  used in industries to track hetero-
geneous  catalyst  performance,  as  such,  STM  is  applied  to  study  the
soft-landing  deposition  and  atomic-layer  deposition  synthesized
methods  of  SACs  for  the  application  in  1,3-butadiene  hydrogenation
[257], CO oxidation [258], and NO reduction [259]. For SAAs, STM can
directly  capture  the  images  of  metallic  single  atom  entities  (e.g.,  Pt
[257],  Ni  [260],  Au  [261],  etc.)  deposited  on  singe  crystal  surfaces
together  with  reactive  hydrogen  [22,257].  Fig.  11(a  and  b)  shows  Pt
atoms  existing  as  isolated  protrusions  substituted  onto  the  Cu(111)
surface and H atoms spillover onto the Cu surface [257]. More recently,
ultrahigh  vacuum  high-speed  STM  has  been  adopted  to  observe  the
real-time growth process of single Ni atoms on graphene. The catalytic
effect of individual Ni atoms at the edges of a growing graphene flake
was captured at the millisecond time scale by STM (Fig. 11(c and d)),
providing an overall picture of the diffusion of mobile nickel atoms that
catalyzes the graphene growth on the edges of SAC islands [260].

3.2. X-ray irradiation spectroscopies

3.2.1. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy

X-ray  Absorption  Spectroscopy  (XAS)  is  a  state-of-the-art  synchro-
tron technique to characterize the local environment of atoms in ma-
terials by measuring the variation in the absorption coefficient under the

scanning of X-ray radiation in an energy range around the absorption
edge [198,262]. XAS can be divided into three regions, pre-edge, near
edge, and extended range (Fig. 12(a)). When the measurement range is
near  the  absorption  edge,  it  stands  for  X-ray  absorption  near  edge
structure (XANES); while the extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) is usually measured beyond the absorption edge in the range of
50 to >1000 eV. From both forms of characterization (which are often
obtained in the same scan), detailed structural information can be pro-
vided  by  these  techniques,  including  the  bond  lengths,  the  angle  be-
tween chemical bonds, oxidation states, and the number of coordinating
species. EXAFS is usually used to show the coordination and absence of
metal–metal interactions, indicating that the supported metal atoms are
individual and that particles or clusters are absent. However, if the el-
ements of the materials are sensitive to electronic and oxidation envi-
ronments,  XANES  will  be  a  more  suitable  characterization  technique.
For instance, Qu et al. [214] reported the preparation of Cu single atoms
on  N-doped  carbon  (Cu  SAs/N–C).  EXAFS  results  revealed  that
Cu–SAs/N–C  exhibits  a  dominant  Cu–N  coordination  at  1.48  Å,  and

there was no Cu–Cu coordination since no Cu–Cu characteristic peaks
were observed. As for comparison, the main peak of Cu–Cu coordination
was  observed  at  2.24 Å on  a  Cu  reference  foil. XANES  was  then  per-
formed for further analysis, and it showed the intensity of the line for
Cu–SAs/N–C located between those for the Cu foil and CuO, revealing its
typical electronic structure (Cu

3.2.2. Near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

X-ray  Photoelectron  Spectroscopy  (XPS)  is  another  widely  used
technique to characterize the chemical states and electronic structures of
surfaces [39,75,265]. It has been used in many SACs to determine the
chemical  state  and  analyze  their  electronic  environment,  such  as
Pt/Fe–N–C  [266],  Pt/CeO2  [267],  ZnNx/C  [268].  Taking  Chen  and
co-workers’ work as an example [269], two peaks in the Pt 4f spectrum
at binding energies of 75.8 and 72.4 eV, ascribing to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 level
were attained. From the XPS analysis, we can clearly distinguish that
those peaks are between the Pt2+
and Pt0 states. The peak positions were
between  those  of  Pt(II)  and  Pt(0),  suggesting  that  Pt  atoms  carry

partially positive charge through electron transfer between metal and
supports owing to enhanced metal(cid:0) support interactions. More recently,
with  the  rapid  development  of  the  in-situ  technique,  near  ambient
pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) was discovered to
track the surface of a catalyst particle at a relatively high temperature in
the gas phase (mbar pressure range). With the aid of this technique, the
study of dynamic modifications at single atom-support surfaces in the
vapor phase environment can be investigated, providing a sophisticated
defect design of next-generation SAC catalysts [270]. Most importantly,
not only the surface but also bulk-dissolved elements can be detected.
The  element  species  that  may  influence  the  chemisorption  or  charge
delocalization of SAC atom can be analyzed, which provides a precise
reaction mechanism of the catalyst in the gaseous phase [162].

3.3. Other in-situ spectroscopy

3.3.1.

Infrared spectroscopy

By  comparing  with  X-ray  spectroscopy,  the  transmission  infrared
spectroscopy  or  Diffuse  Reflectance  Infrared  Fourier  Transform  Spec-
troscopy (DRIFTS) uses a lower wavelength of infrared light reflection
and  transmission  to  evaluate  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  SACs  (e.g.
Acidic sites-Pyridine/NH3 as probe and Basic sites-CO2/CO as probe) or
the change of organic phases of catalysts at time-resolved mode [271,
272]. In addition, DRIFTS is commonly used in conjunction with EXAFS,
where EXAFS provides information about the electronic and geometric
structure of the SACs, while DRIFTS follows the evolutionary formation
of  the  surface  bonding  between  single  atoms  and  specific  acidic  and
basic sites, aiding the understanding of the catalyst-absorbance mech-
anism in operando environment [273,274]. For instance, the infrared
frequency of CO adsorbed on isolated metal atoms is different from that
on  clusters/NPs,  this  is  because  single  metal  atoms  generally  have

different chemical states due to their different coordination structures
with the support [275]. Referring to Fig. 12(c), on increasing the loading
of Rh on ZrO2, the surface structure and mechanism for CO molecule
adsorbed can be studied via absorbance peaks (e.g., atop, bridging, and a
terrace site). In short, Infrared spectroscopy can be used to provide in-
sights into the surface adsorption mechanism with respect to the single
atom loading in SACs. Taking Au–Pd SAA supported on ion exchange
resins  (Au–Pd/resin)  for  the  Ullman  reaction  as  an  example  [42].
DRIFTS  recorded  the  bonding  profile  of  CO  (probe  molecule)  on  the
Au–Pd/resin SAC with different Au/Pd ratios, in which two absorption
(cid:0) 1  which  signifies  the  CO
bands  were  observed  at  1895  and  2020  cm
bridged and on-top adsorption onto the Au–Pd (Fig. 12 (d)).

ORS has been used to investigate the molecular fingerprints of the MoSx
species present during the electrochemical HER in an HClO4 electrolyte
[279].  Based  on  the  Raman  profile  (Fig.  13(b  and  c)),  the  structural
evolution of MoSx films during HER can be attained. As such, the peak at
(cid:0) 1  was captured at potentials relevant to H2  evolution, which
2530 cm
corresponded  to  the  S–H  stretching  vibration  of  MoSx–H  moieties.
(cid:0) 1 which are
MoSx-AE showed additional two peaks at 520 and 550 cm
not seen for MoSx-CE. These were ascribed to the ν(S–S) terminal, and
ν(S–S) bridging vibrations, respectively. Hereby, ORS can be acknowl-
edged as one of the spectroscopic techniques that are typically used to
determine vibrational and rotational modes of active species bonds on
the atomic metal–metal coordination.

3.3.2. Operando Raman Spectroscopy

Operando  Raman  Spectroscopy  (ORS)  is  an  in-situ  technique  to
analyze the structures of materials at various scales from bulk to nano-
scale layers through different photon energies. The application of ORS
can provide unique means for a deeper fundamental understanding of
layered  nanomaterials  and  atomic-scale  catalysts  [276,277].  In  2019,
the first attempt of investigating the atomically dispersed Rh metal on
phosphotungstic acid (Rh/PMA SAC) during CO oxidation via ORS was
proposed by Yan’s group [278]. Based on the spectra shown in Fig. 13
(a), it shows that even after CO oxidation reaction at temperatures 573
K,  the  heteropoly  acid  structure  of  the  Rh/PMA  remains  intact,  sug-
gesting  that  no  formation  of  metal  oxides  after  CO  adsorption  of  Rh
single  atom.  Apart  from  investigating  the  dispersion  of  single  atoms,

3.4. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy

3.4.1. Nuclear magnetic resonance

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) for single atom detection is a
solid-state spectroscopic technique used to identify the electron struc-
tures  or  chemical  bonding  of  the  core  structure  of  a  catalyst.  The
application of solid-state magic-angle spinning-nuclear magnetic reso-
nance  (MAS-NMR)  has  been  widely  reported  to  investigate  the  co-
relationship  of  the  precursor  ligand  bonding  during  the  synthesis  of
SACs [280,281]. In 2017, Zhang and co-authors [37] have synthesized a
highly active Pt-based SAC (Pt/m-Al2O3) by impregnating the Pt atom
on the mesoporous Al2O3 support for selective hydrogenations and CO
oxidation reaction. Based on the MAS-NMR analysis shown in Fig. 14

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107418

A.C.M. Loy et al.

(a),  they  found  that  most  of  the  Al3+
species  were  in  tetrahedral,
pentahedral,  and  octahedral  shapes,  differing  from  nanoparticles
Pt/Al2O3  where the Al3+
pentahedral peak was not seen. This further
confirmed  that  the  significant  pentahedral-coordinated  Al3+
species
have resulted from the calcination and reduction process, in which the
Pt-atom was bound onto the Al surface via bridging O atoms. In addition,
Zhang and co-authors [198] also synthesized a SAC with Pt on a phos-
phomolybdic  acid-modified  active  carbon  (Pt-PMA/AC)  for  hydroge-
nation  reactions.  A  31P  MAS-NMR  was  used  to  study  the  electron
structure of the support with and without the Pt atom loading. Through
the  MAS-NMR  study,  it  revealed  changes  in  the  environment  for  P
bonding in the Pt-loaded PMA/AC. Lately, Shao et al. [245] adopted the
13C  cross-polarized-MAS  NMR  (CP-MAS  NMR)  technique  to  analyze

carbon  bonding  on  an  Ir-based  porous  organic  polymer  with  amino-
pyridine  functionality  (Ir/AP-POP).  Various  carbon  bonding  (such  as
C––O, Py-C, Ar–C, and Py-C) were identified in the Ir/AP-POP catalyst
which assisted in understanding the catalytic mechanism for converting
CO2 to formate by quasi-homogeneous hydrogenation (Fig. 14(b)).

3.4.2. Electromagnetic Spin Resonance

Electromagnetic  Spin  Resonance  (ESR)  is  another  characterization
technique to investigate materials with unpaired electrons. This can be
used to analyze the atomic state and coordination environment of SACs.
For instance, the partial reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) due to graphene-
induced  charge  transfer  in  a  mixed-valence  Cu/functionalized  gra-
phene  SAC  (G(CN)–Cu)  can  be  confirmed  through  ESR  measurement
[282]  (Fig.  15(a)).  Based  on  the  fresh  catalyst  ESR  spectra,  only  the
unpaired electron signal from isolated paramagnetic Cu(II) cations (d9)
was observed, whereas the Cu(I) cations (d10) were not detected. The
authors make a comparison of the ESR spectra of the G(CN)–Cu catalyst
dispersed in hexane before and after adding H2O2. Notably, there was an
increase  in  the  intensity  of  Cu(II)-induced  signal  after  adding  the
peroxide, this suggests that the Cu(I) was oxidized to Cu(II). Adding to
that, ESR also can analyze the Curie behavior of the catalyst (inset in
Fig. 16(a)), such as the non-presence of magnetically interacting Cu(II)
centers in the catalyst. This observation indicated that there are no an-
tiferromagnetic  interactions  or  any  formation  of  bulk  CuO  clusters.
Recently, Jin et al. [283] also reported the superior performance of the
partially oxidized Ni single-atom sites in polymeric carbon nitride for
elevating  photocatalytic  H2  evolution.  Based  on  these  findings,  the
change of oxidation state in Ni has modulated the catalyst’s electronic
structure, leading to an optimized photocatalytic activity, where fewer
unpaired  electrons  were  observed  in  deeply  oxidized  Ni  single  atoms
(Fig. 15(b)). ESR can be concluded as a powerful technique to identify
the  electronic  configurations  of  metal  atoms  in  SACs,  specifically  for
unpair electron detection.

3.4.3. Other characterization techniques

Along  with  the  state-of-art  characterization  techniques,  there  are
also some supplementary techniques that also provide information on
the thermal stability of SACs (Thermogravimetric analysis, TGA), Bru-
nauer–Emmett–Teller  specific  surface  area  of  SACs  (N2  adsorption),
single  atom  metal  loading  on  the  SACs  (Inductively  Coupled  Plasma
Mass Spectrometry, ICP-MS), and dispersion of the single atoms on the
SACs (H2/N2O chemisorption [94,285,286]). With the aid of the sup-
plementary characterization (Table 2), a more in-depth understanding
of the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the catalyst can be eluci-
dated. For instance, Zhang et al. reported that the fabricated PtCu SAA
can  yield  a  high  turnover  frequency  that  reaches  up  to  2.6  × 103
(cid:0) 1  in  glycerol  hydrogenation,  which  is  to  our
molglycerol⋅molPtCu–SAA
knowledge the largest value among reported heterogeneous metal cat-
alysts [172]. Under this context, the dispersion of the Pt atoms on the
SAA is highly important, and such an important piece of information
only  can  be  extracted  from  ICP-MS  and  N2O  chemisorption.  Another
example can be derived from a study reported by Li et al., with the aid of
N2 physisorption, they managed to observe that the Zn SACs are having
multiple types of pores (i.e, micro, meso, and macro), which induces a
(cid:0) 1,  that  is  ~10  folds  higher  than  the
large  surface  area  of  1002  m2  g
commercial zinc catalyst [287,288].

4. Application of SACs in clean energy and chemicals production

As shown in Table 3, SACs have been applied to various heteroge-
neous reactions (e.g. C–C coupling, oxidation, reforming reactions, and
hydrogenation)  for  chemical  and  fuel  production.  Herein,  we  aim  to
provide a comprehensive summary of SAC usage by discussing: (a) How
does the heterogeneous structure of SACs affect the catalytic activity; (b)
How does the structure evolution process response to a wide variety of
intrinsic and extrinsic factors and (c) What are the underlying catalytic

mechanisms in different possible reactions. This section summarizes all
the recent experimental activities of SACs including the operating con-
ditions, type of reactors as well as catalyst loading that affect the yield
and selectivity of the desired products. Besides that, the Computational
DFT  calculation  which  includes  the  binding  energy,  the  electronic
structure, and possible catalytic reaction routes of the SACs is also dis-
cussed.  As  known,  the  first-principles  DFT  calculations  allow  the  in-
vestigations of the energetics of processes at the atomic-level with high
precision  and  provide  quantum  mechanical-based  insights  into  the
related  electronic  structure  of  these  processes  and  their  influence  on
catalyst  reactivity  [289,290].  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  not  only
well-understood catalyst mechanisms but also controversial hypotheses
are cautiously discussed.

4.1. Selective coupling

The mechanistic fundamental questions of C–C coupling reactions on
heterogeneous  catalysts  are  still  not  fully  understood  and  the  metal
active phases are debated [432,433]. This is because the atoms on the
surface of NPs usually have different coordination numbers along with
variable chemical environments (electronic effects) than those of their
neighboring atoms which influences the catalytic activities [434,435].
Another relevant issue related to the use of NPs is the infeasibility of
using  high  loadings  of  expensive  noble  metals,  this  reduces  their
attractiveness  for  bulk  production.  Thus,  the  synthesis  of  highly
dispersed noble metal SACs as a catalyst is highly desirable as it could

overcome this issue by maximizing the metal atomic efficiency, as well
as reducing the catalyst cost [13,19]. However, single atoms are known
for aggregation, leading to clusters and finally nanoparticles. In order to
avoid  their  aggregation  and  induce  stabilization  of  the  single  atoms,
several methods have been proposed: a) the cascade anchoring strategy
of  the  atom  onto  a  metal  oxide  support  [24,35];  b)  a  reductionist
approach by alloying with other alloys to form an SAA [436,437]; or c)
depositing single atoms into different oxide supports or organic frame-
works for superior metal-support interactions [27,36,438]. As a whole,
SACs are an attempt to bridge homogeneous and heterogeneous catal-
ysis closer to understanding and revolutionizing the C–C coupling field.

4.1.1. Research advances of SACs in selective coupling reactions

The catalytic activity of a SAC depends closely on the nature of the
active  isolated  metal  atom  and  the  presence  of  functional  groups,  if
attached  by  linkers,  the  support  used  can  also  induce  a  significant
electronic  perturbation  to  the  atomic  active  site  for  electron  charge
transfer. As a result, the single dispersed atoms of metal anchored on to a
support surface are expected to have a reduced number of coordination
sites for reactants or intermediates in comparison with metal NPs sup-
ported on a surface due to the absence of different active sites. More
importantly, once the metal is anchored on a solid support, it can be
easily regenerated for the next cycle of reaction without any complex
treatment  [17].  Table  4  outlines  the  applications  of  SACs  in  the  C–C
coupling process.

As proclaimed by Tao’s group [284], the developed Pd-based SAC

anchored on TiO2, Pd1/TiO2 via a deposition(cid:0) precipitation method was
highly  selective  and  active  for  more  than  10  C–C  reaction  cycles  of
phenylacetylene  and  iodobenzene  (Fig.  16(a)).  Based  on  XANES  and
EXAFS, the coordination of Pd atoms attached to TiO2  was confirmed
where each Pd atom is bound to four oxygen atoms of the TiO2 surface
support, forming PdO4 units, and the exposed surface of the lattice fringe
of  the  TiO2  is  (101)  with  an  average  TEM  particle  size  of  20–25  nm
(Fig. 16 (b)). To further explore the deactivation and detachment of Pd
atoms from Pd1/TiO2 catalyst after the reaction (Fig. 16(c)), the authors
have also performed the durability test of the spent Pd single atoms on a
TiO2 support by measuring the concentrations of Ti and Pd in a solution
(after centrifugation), followed by characterization using XPS (Fig. 16
(d)). Surprisingly, the peak positions of Pd 3d5/2  were the same, indi-
cating  that  the  Pd  atoms  on  TiO2  supports  have  the  same  chemical
oxidation state before and after the reaction. Regarding the deactivation
study,  the  authors  have  performed  a  hot  filtration-leaching  analysis;
notably, no metals were detected in the filtered solution, indicating the
strong bonding between the Pd atoms (active sites) and TiO2 (support).
Moreover, computational investigations based on DFT calculation have
also been carried out to identify the most thermodynamically favorable

structure, which corresponds to Pd single atoms anchored to four oxygen
atoms of TiO2 through Pd–O–Ti bonds.

Lately, Chem and co-workers [441] reported a heterogeneous cata-
lyst consisting of Pd single atoms anchored on exfoliated graphitic car-
bon  nitride  (Pd-ECN)  for  the  C–C  reaction  of  bromobenzene  with
phenylboronic  acid  pinacol  ester  while  benchmarking  with  homoge-
neous  and  other  bulk  heterogeneous  catalysts  (Fig.  17  (a)).
Microwave-assisted deposition was used in this study to deposit palla-
dium  on  ECN,  a  pristine  high-surface  area  form  of  graphitic  carbon
nitride. STEM coupled with EXAFS was used to investigate the presence
of  Pd  single  atoms,  while  XPS  was  adopted  to  study  the  electronic
properties of the Pd atoms incorporated in the ECN. In addition, the DFT
calculations  were  also  carried  out  to  understand  the  promising  C–C
coupling  performance  of  Pd-ECN.  Molecular  dynamics  simulations
performed at different temperatures show that Pd atoms were confined
within  a  given  cavity,  even  though  they  still  have  some  degree  of
freedom.  This  simulation  evidence  agreed  with  the  experimental  XPS
observations, suggesting that the Pd atoms occupy two preferred posi-
tions: in the first one, Pd was located close to the surface plane, while in
the second one, the metal was in between the two-top planes.

a)  Advantages

• XAS is seen as a critical technique for proving if a SAC is present. This method
can clearly show M–M bonding, if it is present in the EXAFS, there clusters or
further.

• Atomically resolved electron microscopy can elucidate the presence of a

single atom, often due to differences in contrast between support and atom via
dark field HAADF imaging.

• Scanning Tunneling Microscopy has the ability to direct atoms across a
surface by using the tip, this can allow for detailed observations of the
adsorption/desorption of chemisorbed molecules.

b)  Limitation

• Sustained time under an electron beam can cause atoms to agglomerate of

cluster.

• Low metal loadings and high dispersions can result in very long imaging times
for electron microscopy. Not to mention contrast difficulties between support
and single atom, especially if they are impregnated between lattices (d-
spacing).

• Due to low metal loadings, often the axial detection method is required for

ICP, this can lead to a greater noise:signal ratio.

• Standard transmission electron microscopy can easily image down to 2/3 nm

for an unsupported nanoparticle.

• Bulk nanoparticles often have metal loadings >1 wt.% which means that

standard radial detection can be used.

• For XAS data you expect to see M–M bonding so it is easier to assign with

reference materials than single atom equivalents.

b)  Limitation

• Unless there is a clear difference in contrast between the nanoparticle and
support, often an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope is
still required for nanoparticles <3 nm.

• For nanoparticles of sufficient size, differentiating them from individual

particles can be difficult as they will appear agglomerated or of similar size as
the support itself.

• Nanoparticles of size larger than pores in a support material will either block
the pore or ultimately lower the surface area and measurable porosity of the
material.
a)  Advantages

• Bulk materials are very easy to process using scanning electron microscopy as

you can images from the mm → μm scale.

• Bulk generated materials are often made at scale so obtaining representative

samples for ICP and TGA are possible for statistical analysis.

b)  Limitation

• Active site analysis can be problematic if particles are large (>20 nm), this can

often lead to particle agglomeration.

In the reaction mechanism, the first step corresponds to the molec-
ular adsorption of bromobenzene to the metal center and the consequent
change of the Pd coordination number. The authors reported that the
ability of Pd to change its coordination is crucial to the observed cata-
lytic  performance.  In  the  second  step,  bi-hydrated  potassium  phenyl-
boronic acid pinacol ester was adsorbed, and the cation from the salt
occupied the nearest neighbor empty cavity. Thanks to the displacement
–
of  Br
,  phenylboronic  acid  pinacol  ester  coordinates,  the  subsequent
trans-metalation was found to be the rate-determining step of the overall
reaction (Fig. 17(b and c)). After the elimination of the boronic pinacol
ester, the  new C–C  bond  was formed. The elimination  of the product
restores the initial coordination of the Pd atom. Even though the overall
reaction mechanism catalyzed by Pd-ECN reflects that reported for Pd
(PPh3)4  molecular catalyst, in the latter case the role of the ligands is
crucial: the elimination of two ligands occurs prior to the reaction, and it
opens the coordination sphere of Pd, allowing the coordination of the
substrate. A third ligand was then released during the trans-metalation
step.

As mentioned above, heterogeneous alloyed SACs or known as SAA
can be prepared using two metals, via isolation of the single metal atom
by another metal atom. The synergistic effect between the two metals
will  alter  the  geometric  and  electronic  structures  of  alloyed  SACs,
potentially  inducing exceptional catalytic  performance for various re-
actions [22,443]. Zhang and co-workers [42] have reported a durable

and  efficient  Au  -Pd  SAA  for  the  Ullmann  reaction  of  aryl  halides  in
water.  The  investigated  Pd-based  SAC  exhibited  an  excellent  Ullman
coupling activity, not only of aryl bromides and iodides but also of the
less reactive aryl chlorides. As known, aryl chlorides are less expensive,
readily available, and more sustainable than their analogous aryl bro-
mides  and  iodides.  For  this  reason,  their  utilization  as  substrates  is
highly desirable. However, in the literature, only a few examples of Pd
NP  catalysts  were  reported  to  be  worked  well  with  aryl,  but  the
bi-metallic SAA presented by Zhang and collaborators furnishes a valid
alternative. The Au–Pd SAA was prepared with an ion exchange-NaBH4
reduction method, and the presents of Pd single atoms were isolated by
the  Au  atoms  as  confirmed  by  the  EXAFS  and  DRIFTS  analysis.  The
DRIFTS result was in good agreement with the EXAFS result, indicating
that the Au alloyed Pd single atom configuration was formed at Au/Pd
≥ 4.  Remarkably,  the  Au–Pd  SAA  managed  to  convert  ~90%  of  aryl
without deactivation over the course of eight cycles.

Another  class  of  C–C  coupling  reaction  includes  the  hydro-
formylation  of  olefins  to  produce  aldehydes,  which  are  important  in-
termediates  to  produce  other  chemicals.  Wang  et  al.  [207],  have
recently developed CoO-supported Rh single-atom catalysts (Rh/CoO)
with  remarkable  selectivity  towards  propene  hydroformylation.  The
authors  investigated  the  yield  and  selectivity  of  butyraldehyde  by
increasing  the  Rh  weight  loading  (e.g.,  0.2,  1.0,  and  4.8  wt.%).  The
(cid:0) 1 and selectivity of
highest turnover frequency (TOF) number of 2065 h

94.4%  for  butyraldehyde  were  obtained  when  the  catalyst  with  the
lowest Rh weight loading. Furthermore, the stability of 0.2% Rh/CoO
was also studied by recycling the catalyst five times. Over the cycles, the
catalyst  remained  highly  active,  similar  to  the  initial  reaction,  the
selectivity  slightly  decreased  to  94.0%  by  the  final  cycle.  To  further
understand the facilitation and adsorption of propene on Rh single sites
in an atmosphere containing both H2  and CO (syngas), a DFT investi-
gation was performed. The DFT calculations showed indeed that after
the adsorption of H2 and CO, Rh atoms moved from the original lattice
position, leading to a reconstruction of Rh active atoms that facilitate the
adsorption  of  propene.  Furthermore,  DFT  calculations  also  showed
dissociative adsorption of the H2 molecule, leading to the formation of
an OH group on the CoO surface, while CO preferentially binds to the Rh
active site, due to the strong interaction with Rh single atoms. DFT was
also used to investigate the reaction mechanism that proceeds through
three consecutive steps: a) one of the adsorbed H atoms will attack the
C––C bond in the adsorbed propene molecule; b) CO will insert into the
opened C––C bond; and c) the second adsorbed hydrogen atom will then
combine with the C atom in the reactively formed terminal C––O to form
the  final  product.  The  remarkable  activity  and  selectivity,  and  high
stability of 0.2% Rh/CoO are of high importance for potential applica-
tions  in  industrial  processes  by  reducing  the  cost  and  pollution  effi-
ciently.  Another  remarkable  example  from  Zhang’s  group,  thermally
stable Rh-based SACs which favor the hydroformylation of olefins has
been synthesized [39]. Notably, the Rh1/ZnO SAC has demonstrated a
very high TON of 40,000 with 99% selectivity towards aldehyde prod-
ucts, which is to our knowledge the largest value among reported het-
erogeneous  metal  catalysts.  This  level  of  selectivity  has  not  been
previously reported for Rh, without the use of specific support materials
such as polymers (ligand steric effects), or zeolites (confinement effects),
adding great impact and benefit to the SACs. Also, the fabricated SAC
has  shown  a  high  stability  profile  in  terms  of  recycling,  where  no
obvious leaching or aggregation of Rh active metals were observed after
a 4th run of experiments.

As shown in Table 2, all the examples mentioned imply that SACs can
be  a  valid  alternative  to  bridge  both  homogenous  and  heterogeneous
catalysts for C–C coupling reactions. However, the development of SACs
with notably improved performances relies on the contribution of both
theoretical  and  experimental  investigations.  DFT  methods  can  be
applied to investigate crucial aspects that are not directly accessible by
experiments, such as the nature of the active sites of different SACs and
the ways substrate molecules interact with single atoms [444]. Overall,
the electronic metal-support strong interactions are a critical concern to
increase the catalytic performance of coupling, and thus, modulation of
the charge density of anchored single metal atoms should be emphasized
in future research.

4.2. Selective hydrogenation

Selective  hydrogenation  represents  essential  processes  in  the
organometallic chemistry process, particularly in the petrochemical and
fine chemical industries. For petrochemicals, selective hydrogenation is
the most common route to eliminate the impurities such as alkynes and
dienes in the ethylene industry for downstream polymerization [445].
Meanwhile,  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  alkenyl,  carbonyl,  and
carboxyl functional groups of the feedstock are required to be selectively
reduced through H2 to their corresponding alkenes, alcohols, and amine
products  which  are  key  intermediates  for  fine  chemicals  production
[446]. Notably, a quarter of the chemical industrial processes include at
least one hydrogenation step, and therefore it is not surprising that the
selective hydrogenation reaction is one of the hot topics investigated in
the catalysis field [447]. However, it is a challenging task when two or
multiple functional groups coexist in the substrate and also, the hydro-
genation  of  C––C  bonds  is  much  easier  than  that  of  the  C––O  bonds,
thermodynamically favored by 35 kJ/mol [448].

A new generation of catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions

has been developed to tackle the challenges by introducing the “active
site isolation”  strategy. Atom assemblies and isolation techniques can
exhibit  different  physicochemical  properties  in  altering  different  hy-
drogenation  mechanisms  and  show  a  better  catalytic  hydrogenation
activity compared to NP counterparts [449,450]. Lately, SACs have also
been widely applied in the selective hydrogenation of styrene, acetylene,
glycerol, crotonaldehyde, and nitriles; mainly attributed to lowering the
activation  barriers,  governing  catalytic  reactivity,  enhancing  the
adsorption model, and also possessing uniform single active sites [213,
451]. For example, isolated Pd atoms on a Cu surface lower the reaction
barriers of both hydrogen uptake and subsequent desorption from the Cu
metal surface, enhancing the selectivity of styrene hydrogenation [22].
Meanwhile, anchoring single Rh (Rh1) atoms to Mo edge vacancy sites of
2-dimensional MoS2  could also facilitate the H2  dissociation in hydro-
genation [401]. There are also studies reporting that encapsulating Ni
atoms with transition metals can improve covalent chemical bonding,
owing to the inherent vulnerability of nickel-based SACs under acidic
hydrogenation conditions [452].

4.2.1. Research advances of SACs used for selective hydrogenation

◦

A comprehensive summary of the catalytic performances of different
SACs for selective hydrogenation reactions is listed in Table 5. Although
the  operational  conditions,  reactor  configuration,  catalyst  loading,
temperature, and pressure may vary greatly, it has been shown that a
low  Pt  loading  can  be  incorporated  into  graphite  shells,  generating
‘carbon onions’ (Pt/C) via an arc-discharge method. This was found to
provide  remarkable  conversion  and  reaction  selectivity,  comparable
with other hydrogenation SACs [453]. Notably, the Pt@C exhibits a high
catalytic reactivity and stability towards the chemo-selective hydroge-
nation  of  functionalized  nitroarenes  under  mild  reaction  conditions.
High selectivity of p-chloroaniline at >99% was obtained using EtOH
under optimized reaction conditions, 40
C, 1.0 bar of H2  pressure, 40
mg of catalyst loading, and 1 h reaction time. On top of that, the syn-
thesized Pt/C catalyst displays a superior reusability performance over
at least 10 cycles and without any loss in hydrogenation activity and
selectivity, suggesting that the graphitic shells of carbon ‘onions’  pro-
hibited a chemical coarsening of the Pt single atoms, which alters the
effective  penetration  channels  for  the  transport  of  ions  and  electrons
during the catalytic reaction [453]. The proposed encapsulated graphite
shells  of  the  SAC  were  also  processed  using  HRTEM  images  (Fig.  18
(a–c)), with a well-distributed Pt(111) interplanar size of 0.255 nm. This
clearly shows the effect of arc medium concentration, where Fig. 18 (a)
utilizes a 0.975 mM salt which generates Pt nanoparticles, whereas an
arc medium concentration of 0.0195 mM created a dispersed catalyst
that was atomically resolved (Fig. 18 (b)). The x-ray diffractograms in
Fig. 18 (d), clearly show that the Pt SAC does not have a (111) feature,
contrary to the Pt NP catalyst.

Lately, Zhang and colleagues [198] have studied the anchoring effect
of  mesoporous  γ-Al2O3  on  Pt  atoms,  likely  on  the  catalyst’s  stability
through unsaturated pentahedral Al3+
coordination for the hydrogena-
tion of a ketone. The superior catalytic activity highlights the applica-
bility of the catalyst for hydrogenation reactions in a small amount of Pt
species  loadings  on  Al2O3.  As  reported  in  a  previous  study,  aromatic
rings normally coordinate with multiple metal atoms before undergoing
hydrogenation  and  remain  to  interact  with  the  metal  surface  during
stepwise hydrogenation [457]. However, the proposed mechanism is not
possible for SACs as found in this study [456] where the hydrogenation
ring on Pt/Al2O3 is almost fully suppressed. Alternatively, the Pt species
favors C––O bond adsorption and activation forming an η1(O) configu-
ration [458,459]. In the η1(O) configuration, the acetophenone will be
adsorbed on to a Pt single-atom site for reacting with H2 to form 1-phe-
nylethanol. Then, the intermediate product transfers to the Al2O3  sup-
port where it is strongly bound before desorbing into the solution phase,
suppressing the deactivation of a Pt site, and enhancing the reusability
of the catalyst for the next cycle. A similar result has been obtained by
Lucci  et  al.  [257]  in  which  the  synthesized  Pt/Cu(111)  SAA  can  be

high space-time yield (3.78 gPt
as shown in Fig. 20(a). Based on the transition of the catalyst in prep-
aration (Fig. 20(b–d)), a well homogenously dispersed Pt atom of 2.59
wt  %  was  impregnated  on  WO3  support  without  any  formation  of
nanoclusters, suggesting that the isolation of Pt over WOx was success-
fully  achieved. To  further  understand the  physiochemical property  of
SACs a mechanism for how the Pt/WOx  SAC behaves for the selective
glycerol hydrogenation was proposed in Fig. 20(e), [460]. Firstly, the
unshared-pair of electrons in the glycerol’s O atoms was trapped by the
unoccupied W6+
d orbital, forming an ether-like bond with a W atom
(Step 1). The strong interaction with the W atom will weaken the bond
between the O and H atoms and facilitate the oxidation of an H atom
(Step 2). Then, extraction of protons from the terminal O atom of W––O
occurred  and  formed  W–OH,  while  the  W6+
species  was  partially
reduced  (Step  3).  This  finding  was  proven  by  Raman  spectroscopy,
where  the terminal W––O band intensity decreased significantly after
contacting  with glycerol. In step 4, the  WOx  Brønsted acid sites were
consumed, catalyzing the dehydration pathway and stabilizing the for-
mation of the secondary carbocation from glycerol. Owing to the oxo-
philic characteristic of W species, the H2 is assumed to be heterolytically
dissociated on the interface between Pt and WOx, exhibiting both acid
sites (H
). Thus, rapid hydrogenation of
3-hydroxypicolinic acid can occur and gives rise to a high yield of 1,3-PD
(Step  5).  This  study  provided  an  in-depth  synergistic  mechanism  be-
tween Pt and WOx species for the production of 1,3-PD. The design of the
WOx supported pseudo-single atom Pt catalyst yielded a high selectivity
of 1,3-PD (45.7%) under a low H2 pressure environment.

Despite many experimental works reported on the robust nature of
the SACs for selective hydrogenation reactions, there is  still a lack of
molecular  calculations  and  microkinetic  simulations  to  back  up  the
hydrogenation  activity  and  mechanisms  [463–465].  In  2018,  Thir-
umalai  and  co-authors  [461]  reported  the  reactivity  of  a  series  SAAs
consisting of Au, Ag, and Cu nanoparticles doped with single atoms of Pt,
Pd, Ir, Rh, and Ni in the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene via DFT
calculations. They reported that from the d-band model generated by
Hammer  and  Nørskov,  AuPd  and  AgPd  were  chosen  as  the  potential
candidate for hydrogenation. The findings indicate that the acetylene
most likely adsorbs at the FCC sites of AuPd and AgPd. By comparing the
binding energies of acetylene at the FCC site and atop sites, it reveals
that acetylene was less stable on the atop sites by 0.111 eV for AuPd and

0.008 eV for AgPd, meanwhile the ethylene adsorption at the FCC sites
and  atop  sites  differ  by  0.23  eV  for  AuPd  and  0.019  eV  for  AgPd.
Notably, the acetylene and ethylene prefer bonding as α-bonded com-
plexes on pure metal surfaces. However, in the presence of a reactive Pd
atom  in  a  relatively  inert  host,  they  bind  strongly  with  the  surface
through α-complexes in an atop conformation. Furthermore, the ener-
getics of hydrogenation is more favorable for single atom alloys rather
than  their  respective  pure  host  metals  (Fig.  20(f)),  deducing  that  the
single  atom  alloys  are  favorable  for  the  formation  of  the  vinyl  inter-
mediate,  attributing  to  the  strong  adsorption  on  the  Pd  atom  which
resulted in excellent selectivity towards the formation of ethylene. The
co-adsorption energy of intermediate on AuPd and AgPd are very close,
suggesting  that  the  Pd  atom  in  the  alloys  is  mainly  responsible  for
driving the reaction forward. As noted, the energy barrier for ethylene
desorption is almost negligible on single atom alloys, resulting in im-
mediate desorption which prevents further hydrogenation of ethane.

Moreover, a DFT study in conjunction with Scaling Relations Kinetic
Monte Carlo (SRMC) simulations reported by Jørgensen and Gronbeck
[462], found that the main reaction mechanisms for hydrogenation of
acetylene(cid:0) ethylene  will  be  C2H2  adsorption.  However,  the  C2H2
adsorption  is  exothermically  stronger  on  Pd(111)  as  compared  to  Cu
(111)  and  Pd/Cu(111).  Meanwhile,  the  H2  dissociative  adsorption  is
barrier less on the Pd-containing surfaces, but it is high for the Cu(111).
The observation for the absence of an H2 dissociation barrier on Pd and a
considerable barrier on Cu is consistent with the previous studies [22,
466]. Based on these simulations, it can be concluded that the Pd/Cu
(111) SAA has a selectivity higher than that of Pd(111), mainly due to
the weak binding of ethylene on Cu as compared to Pd while a strong
binding  of  C2H4  at  the  edges  and  corners  sites  hinders  the  ethylene
desorption before further hydrogenation. In short, acetylene(cid:0) ethylene
hydrogenation  should  contain  minority  sites  that  readily  dissociate
hydrogen  and  the  majority  sites  where  ethylene  is  weakly  adsorbed.
Nonetheless, all the above findings have opened a promising avenue to
the  rational  design  of  SACs  for  selective  hydrogenation.  Despite
the  stability  of  SACs  under
much-perceived  subjectivity  on
high-temperature  conditions  for  selective  hydrogenation  reactions,
many  experimental  works  have  demonstrated  that  SACs  can  provide
stable  activity  under  many  reaction  cycles  or  reaction  times  for  this
application.

Key findings

A low Pd loading of 168 ppm (AgPd0.005/SiO2 catalyst) was
sufficient to yield 92.6% conversion of acetylene with 92.3%
selectivity of ethylene.
The high conversion was obtained via analogous Au -Pd SAA systems
over a wide temperature window.
An optimal Pd/Ag surface composition and isolated electron rich Pd
atoms structure can be obtained through high temperature pre-
reduction.
The single Rh atoms anchored to the edges of 2D MoS2 sheets
maintained a 100% conversion of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol
even under sustained reaction times.
The electron transfer from the Rh1 atoms to the surrounding S atoms
of the MoS2 sheets was the origin of the positive oxidation state of
the anchored single Rh1 atoms.

4.3. Selective reforming

SACs have emerged as a new frontier in catalysis for hydrogen pro-
duction  from  methane  reforming  and  water-gas  shift  reactions.  Dry
Reforming  of  Methane  (DRM)  has  received  much  attention  in  the
hydrogen  production  sector,  as  this  sustainable  process  exploits  two
major greenhouse gases (GHG), carbon dioxide and methane to produce
industrially important syngas. Table 4 shows the application of SACs for

hydrogen production, specifically in DRM and the WGSR over the last
five years. Numerous supported precious metal SACs (e.g., Pd, Pt, Ru,
and Rh) and a few transition metals SACs (Ni and Co) have been used for
DRM. Despite the high coking resistance of precious metal-based cata-
lysts,  the  use  of  precious  metals  in  the  synthesis  of  catalysts  is  often
regarded as a non-sustainable approach due to the high cost and low
availability of noble metals, which are typically limited for large-scale
applications  [467].  On  the  other  hand,  Ni-based  catalysts  are

generally more economical and are more abundant. Despite the low cost
and high availability, Ni exhibits a high sintering tendency, poor deac-
tivation  resistance,  and  high  affinity  toward  coke  deposition  on  the
active  sites  under  a  reaction  temperature  over  800
C  [468,469].
Ni-based catalysts are well-known for their high sintering tendency via
particle migration and Ostwald ripening under a high reaction temper-
ature and steam environment. The sintering and agglomeration of the
active phase increase the particle size and reduces the dispersion of the
metal  atoms  [469,470].  The  number  of  atomically  dispersed  active
species also decreases significantly and eventually leads to poor activity
performance.  Furthermore,  severe  carbon  deposition  on  the  Ni  active
site was also reported extensively in the literature. With such bulky NPs
formed  from  the  sintering  phenomenon,  a  side  reaction  of  methane
pyrolysis readily takes place on the metallic NP sites due to the very high
adsorption  energy.  The  methane  pyrolysis  reaction  could  produce  a
layer  of  carbonaceous  material  on  the  metallic  surface  which  in  turn
leads to catalyst deactivation after a long period of reaction time [471].

4.3.1. Research advances of SACs in selective reforming processes

As previously mentioned, the coking resistance and stabilization of
an atomically dispersed active phase on a support material during a long
time  on  stream  are  still  regarded  as  one  of  the  few  major  challenges
encountered in the DRM and are yet to be resolved by academic and
industrial practitioners. In line with the efforts in addressing the coking
resistance  and  stabilization  issue,  numerous  previous  works  have  re-
ported the considerable effect of CeO2 on the size, dispersion, stability,
and  deactivation  resistance  of  active  sites  [203].  For  the  synthesis  of
SACs, it is summarized that the support material should possess a high
affinity with the active phase leading to a high dispersion and strong
metal-support interaction (SMSI) [164]. A list of SACs used for methane
reforming, steam reforming, and water gas shift reactions is tabulated in
Table 6. In a recent work by Tang et al. [368], a novel bimetallic Ni/Ru
SAC  supported  on  CeO2  was  synthesized  and  proposed  for  the  DRM
application. As shown in AP-XPS spectra (Fig. 21(a)), the catalytic sur-
face  of  Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2  SACs  consists  of  two  sets  of  atomically
dispersed Ni and Ru species. Also, the fraction of Ce3+

there is a positive synergistic effect between Ni and Ru cations which
enhance the DRM activity. Furthermore, computation studies also un-
covered the synergetic effects and complement functions of the atomi-
cally dispersed Ni and Ru under a low concentration of 2.5 metal atomic
%. Ni atoms are highly active in the adsorption of CH4,  and Ru atoms
have a high affinity toward CO2. From the operando studies of chemical
and coordination environments, both Ni and Ru single atoms anchored
on the CeO2  surface remained in a cationic form instead of a metallic
state. This was found to promote the catalytic performance of the SAC
C, outperforming NP counterparts, as depicted
significantly up to 600
in Fig. 21 (c).

Akri et al. [164] synthesized a highly active and carbon-resistant Ni
SAC  supported  on  hydroxyapatite  (HAP)  using  a  Strong  Electrostatic
Adsorption (SEA) method. The 0.5 wt.% Ni SAC exhibited the highest
CO2 and CH4 reaction rates of 816.5 mol/(gcat h) and 1186 mol/(gcat h),
respectively, which was four and five times higher than the reaction rate

of nickel NP catalysts. The 0.5 wt.% Ni SACs displayed excellent carbon
deposition resistance as evidenced by the negligible weight loss of spent
Ni SACs when characterized under thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).
Despite its high activity performance and carbon deposition resistance,
the Ni SACs suffered from poor stabilization of the atomically dispersed
Ni phase. Severe sintering and aggregation of Ni atoms were observed in
the 0.5 wt.% Ni SACs, which led to its high deactivation rate after a few
hours of reaction. The same research team also attempted to reinforce
the  stability  of the  previous Ni SACs by  using a  polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) assisted preparation method. A small amount of PVP was added
during the co-precipitation process of the Ni SAC. It was found that the
catalytic  stability  of  Ni  SACs  improved  significantly  with  very  little
carbon  deposition  on  the  catalyst  surface.  Such  improvement  in  the
catalytic behavior could be attributed to the highly dispersed Ni single
atoms  on  the  surface,  hindering  the  inner  active  site  from  sintering
phenomena during the reaction.

In  another  study  by  Akri  et  al.  [369],  the  stabilization  effect  of
ceria-doped hydroxyapatite (Ce-HAP) for atomically dispersed Ni spe-
cies  was  investigated.  From  the  in-situ  XPS  and  Temperature  Pro-

unambiguously revealed that the ceria-doped HAP stabilized the atom-
ically  dispersed  Ni  from  sintering  and  aggregation  under  a  high
temperature-reducing  H2  environment.  Despite  the  high  reduction

compared to the undoped counterparts. In the end, the Ce species was
reported to act as a stabilizing anchor for the atomically dispersed Ni
rather than to suppress carbon deposition. As compared to the SAC work
by Tang et al. [368], the 2 wt.% Ni SAC supported on Ce-doped HAP in
Akri et al. [369] delivered similar catalytic performance and superior
stability under identical reaction conditions, without using a precious

metal. A low 0.5% Ni/HAP SAC (20 times less Ni loading) exhibited a
comparable  CH4  reforming  activity  to  that  of  the  10%  commercial
Ni/HAP under similar reaction conditions.

Pt  atoms  behave  only  as  spectators  in  the  process  [475,476].  The
fundamental questions have finally been resolved by Ammal and Hey-
den [477] through a DFT calculation, in which positively charged single
Pt atoms stabilized on a TiO2 (110) surface can be as active as Pt clusters
for  the  WGS  reaction  at  low  and  high  temperatures.  The  calculation
revealed that the interface edge Pt and single Pt2+
sites exhibited a high
WGS activity at low temperatures whereas the corner Pt interface sites
become  active  at  higher  temperatures.  As  such,  the  single  Pt2+
sites
acted as a stabilizer on an active reducible surface such as TiO2 while the
oxygen vacancies in the support play a significant role in enhancing the
WGS activity. A possible reaction pathway for the WGS was also pro-
posed, containing the redox, carboxyl, and formate pathways, shown in
Fig. 22(a). As reported, the redox reaction was the dominant pathway
between  the  temperature  range  of  200–400
C,  while  high  TOFs  are
possible  for  this  active  site.  Meanwhile,  the  carboxyl  pathway  with
redox regeneration was less favorable than the formate pathway with
redox regeneration. Its rate was very close to that of the classical redox

tend to stabilize on the CeO2(110) sites with H as ligands, owing to the
similar  characteristics  and  advantages  of  both  homogeneous  and  het-
erogeneous  catalysts  [478,479].  Based  on  the  free  energy  profiles  as
displayed  in  Fig.  22(b),  we  can  also  clearly  see  that  the  presence  of
additional  surface  H  atoms  could  reduce  the  energy  barrier  for  the
interfacial H-transfer process (TS23) by about 0.2 eV, compared to the
CO-assisted  redox  pathway  (TS18),  suggesting  that  the  associative
carboxyl with redox regeneration pathway is likely the most favorable
pathway.

The  excellent  catalytic  activity and  stability  of  Pt  nanoclusters  re-
ported by Ammal and Heyden [477] are in good agreement with Guo
et  al.  [468].  In  2014,  Li’s  group  [473]  synthesized  stable  and  highly
active  Pt-based  SACs  for  methanol  steam  reforming  using  the
desorption-absorption  method,  by  embedding  the  isolated  precious
metal  atoms  of  Pt  and  Au  onto  a  ZnO  surface.  A  spin-polarized  DFT
calculation  coupled  with  STEM  characterization  was  performed  to
investigate the intrinsic nature of the active sites of the catalyst. The DFT
calculation revealed that the corresponding formation energies of single
Pt and Au atoms were 0.22 and 0.86 eV, respectively, which were much
lower than the reservoirs in equilibrium with large metal counterparts.
This  observation  indicates  that  the  embedded  Pt  and  Au  are  thermo-
dynamically stable and resistant to segregation during the catalytic re-
actions and thus, providing a stronger binding toward the intermediates,
as well as lowering reaction barriers. The enhancement of the catalytic
activity can be seen where the TOF found in the single Pt sites embedded
onto ZnO(1010) surfaces are over 1000 times higher than that of the
pristine ZnO. The hypothesis was further confirmed by electron beam
irradiation, where the isolated Pt single atoms were found to be rela-
tively  stable  after  anchoring  onto  ZnO(1010).  All  the  HAADF  images
show no Pt or Au clusters/particles in the synthesized Pt1/Au1/ZnO SAC.
In  short,  to  cater  to  higher  reforming rates,  multi-functional  SACs
should  be  developed  with  a  significant  number  of  interfacial  sites,
resulting from the presence of individually dispersed metal atoms on the
support. This could avoid the coking resistance and stabilize the atom-
ically dispersed active phase on a support material under a long time-on-
stream.  Moreover,  due  to  the  involvement  of  multiple  species  and
commonly  complex  reaction  mechanisms  in  the  catalytic  reforming
process, the usage of DFT for the study of reaction-free energy to unravel
potential reaction pathways provides many useful insights for designing
SACs  from  first-principles.  Furthermore,  although  methane-based  re-
actions are the most applicable for catalytic reforming in the industry,
more effort should be carried into branching out toward other chemical
species to understand the possibilities of SAC in additional applications.

4.4. Selective oxidation

Extending  to  the  energy  matrices,  novel  SACs  have  been  widely
applied  in  the  selective  oxidation  field.  As  such,  the  unique  catalytic

performance  of  SACs  has  demonstrated  a  huge  prospect  in  various
oxidation reactions such as CO oxidation or PROX, aerobic oxidation of
alcohols, formaldehyde oxidation, and methane oxidation [13,480]. The
sub-nanometer clusters of single metals were reported to have a better
enhancement in catalytic activity or selectivity compared to larger bulk
nanoparticles [481,482]. Apart from that, the utilization efficiency of
the metal catalyst and selectivity, either for the adsorption or desorption
activities of the active species can be modified via metal atom isolation,
which directly influences the reactions kinetics [480,483]. Due to the
interesting  behavior  found  in  metal  SACs,  these  have  attracted
numerous  researchers  to  have  an  in-depth  understanding  of  their
behavior and mechanism [102].

However, a common problem faced for selective oxidation reactions
is the decrease in size from a nanoparticle to a single atom, in which the
surface  free  energy  of  metals  increases  significantly  with  decreasing
particle  size,  promoting  aggregation  of  small  clusters  of  the  catalyst
[13]. This can be prevented by implementing a high surface area support
material  that  could interrelate  well  with  the  metal  atoms,  and  postu-
lating an isolated metal that can accommodate the metal surfaces, metal
oxides, and carbon materials in the system [484,485].

4.4.1. Research advances of SAC in selective oxidation

According  to  Duprez  and  Cavani  [486],  selective  oxidation  is
achievable  using  the  famous  Mars  and  van  Krevelen  mechanism  that
involves different transition metal ion oxides that display redox prop-
erties such as Cu, V, Mo, Cr, Te, Sb, Bi, and Fe [487]. Among all the metal
ion oxides, the atomically dispersed Co and Cu catalysts have been re-
ported to exhibit the highest catalytic activity in the selective oxidation
of benzyl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (M = Fe, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu)
[488]. In 2017, The first pioneering work of non-noble Co-based SAC for
selective  oxidation  was  reported  by  Guan’s  group.  An  atomically
dispersed Co on N2-doped graphene (denoted as Co-NG) in an ammonia
medium via pyrolysis technique was synthesized [489]. Notably, a high
benzyl  alcohol  conversion  (94.8%)  and  benzaldehyde  selectivity
(97.5%) were achieved over 6 h and 120
C using a small amount of
Co-NG (5 mg). However, under the absence of N2 doping, a much lower
conversion  of  42.5%)  than  Co-NG  in  selective  oxidation  of  benzyl
alcohol was attained. As reported previously, the single metal atom on a
carbon matrix can be stabilized by introducing N atoms as an “anchor”
[99]. The N2 doping does not solely strengthen the interaction between
the  metal  atom  and  the  support  but  also  promotes  electron  transfer,
which resulted in a firmly anchored, atomically dispersed metal atom on
supports  [490,491].  A  possible  catalytic  reaction  mechanism  for  the
aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over Co-NG was also postulated as
follows: Firstly, the oxygen molecules were weakly adsorbed on the Co
center,  followed  by  electron  transfer  activation  to  form  a  superoxide
species  (Co 3d  orbitals to  O2  2p antibonding orbitals).  Lastly, the  su-
peroxide species will react with the hydrogen bonding of benzyl alcohol
to produce benzaldehyde [492,493].

◦

Furthermore, Harrath et al. [364] also studied the catalytic mecha-
nism of M/ZrO2 SAC (M = single atom of Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt, Fe) for a one-step
conversion of CH4 to CH3OH. Their work also found that Rh/ZrO2 SAC
induced  the  dissociative  adsorption  of  H2O2  on  its  surface  with great
binding  energy  ((cid:0) 2.87  eV),  favoring  the  selective  oxidation  of  CH4
pathway.  Subsequent  steps  in  the  reaction  pathway  of  Rh/ZrO2  SAC
include the adsorption of methane, and formation of C–H bond (which
forms a methyl radical and HOO–Rh site) to further produce CH3OH or
by-product  CH3OOH  (Fig.  23(a)).  Apart  from  that,  the  non-noble
Fe/ZrO2  SAC  was  also  expected  to  give  high  selectivity  of  methanol
due to the lower energy barrier for methyl radical formation (0.49 eV
lower)  and  methanol  formation  (0.13  eV  lower)  on  O–Fe/ZrO2
compared to O–Rh/ZrO2 (Fig. 23(b)). Notably, the pathway to produce
the CH3COOH by-product via a Fe/ZrO2  SAC was suppressed due to a
kinetically thermodynamic unfavorable energy barrier of 2.77 eV, sug-
gesting a high selectivity for the main product CH3OH can be obtained.

which is one order of magnitude higher than its NP and cluster

Single Ir atoms acted as the key active site and contributed 70% of
the overall WGS activity.
Presence of atomically dispersed Pt and Au species improved the
binding energies of reactant and intermediates (increased by
0.99–1.84 eV) on a ZnO (1010) surface and reduced the formation
energy of oxygen vacancies (~1.31 eV).
Higher CH3OH conversion and CO2 selectivity were obtained
using Pt/ZnO (43%, 88%), as compared to Au/ZnO (28%, 100%).

5 wt.% Ni/MgO exhibited the highest activity because it bonded
the reactant and intermediate more strongly than the other two
candidates.
2.5 wt.% Ni/MgO binds the reactant and reaction intermediates
weakly and the number of neighboring Ni site was too little to
catalyze the DRM reaction.

selective oxidative reactions as shown in Table 7, more studies further
challenged  the  selective  benzylic  C–H  oxidation  of  hydrocarbon  de-
rivatives under mild conditions. This is because most studies have re-
ported that selective oxidation of saturated C–H bonds is difficult and
◦
aggressive conditions (>120
C and 10 bar oxygen pressure) are usually
required to obtain a high selectivity of desired products [494]. In 2019,
Bakandritsos  together  with  his  co-workers  disclosed  a  mixed-valence
Cu-based  SAC  for  oxidative  homocoupling  of  benzylamines  [282].
Fig. 24(a) shows that the G(CN)–Cu SAC was synthesized using the co-
ordination  of  Cu(II)  ions  to  CN-functionalized  graphene  (cyano-gra-
phene, G(CN)) where the graphene-induced charge-transfer reduced the
Cu(II) ions anchored to G-CN into the Cu(I). Surprisingly, the G(CN)–Cu
SAC was able to yield an excellent conversion (up to 98%) and selec-
◦
tivity (up to 99%) under mild conditions (85
C, 1bar). In addition, the G
(CN)–Cu SAC remained at a very high conversion rate (94%), even after
5 recycling steps with no change in product selectivity (98%) (Fig. 24
(g)).  This  observation  was  supported  by  the  TEM  images,  in  which  a
clear detection of Cu atoms can be observed before and after the cata-
lytic reaction (Fig. 24(b–f)), suggesting the active sites of the Cu are not
prone to sintering even during a high reaction temperature. In addition
to that, the XPS analysis also further confirmed the high catalytic ac-
tivity of the G(CN)–Cu SAC, in which there was no change of the Cu
mixed valance state from 1st to 5th cycles (Fig. 24(h)). The G(CN)Cu
(cid:0) 1) at low tem-
also displayed a high turnover frequency (TOF = 13 h
peratures (<100
C), proving that it has a strong electron-withdrawing
character (withdraw electron from CF3-substituted benzylamine) than
that of the current best performing NP catalysts in the literature (e.g.,
CuO  nanoflakes  and  Cs/MnOx)  [495,496].  Through  the  DFT  analysis
and EPR measurement, a possible oxidative amine coupling mechanism
for the study was proposed as shown in Fig. 24(i). Firstly, the oxidative
dehydrogenation of the benzylamines started with O2  reduction in the

◦

active copper enzymes through its preferential coordination with Cu(I)
centers (step 1), which leads to the formation of copper-oxyl interme-
diate between the Cu ions (step 2). In order to yield the formation of an
imine, a two-hydrogen abstraction from the neighboring amine by the
reactive  oxyl  species  was  essential  (step  3).  In  step  4,  the  hydroxyl
radicals produced were trapped and finally, the NH3  and N-benzylide-
ne-benzylamine  were  produced  through  the  amine–imine  coupling.
Lastly,  the  catalyst  was  regenerated  and  can  be  reused  for  further
oxidative coupling of benzylamines.

With  respect  to  theoretical  screening  works,  there  have  been  few
studies investigating the fundamental mechanism of oxidation via SACs
[498,499].  For  instance,  the  fundamental  insights  of  CO  oxidation
catalyzed  by  using  single  Au  atoms  supported  on  Thoria  (Au/ThO2)
through  DFT  with  Hubbard-type  On-site  Coulomb  interaction  simula-
tion  (DFT  + U)  were  reported  lately  [498].  From  the  computational
study, three main steps mechanism of facilitation of the Au-doped ThO2
(111) surface for CO oxidation was analyzed: 1) Reaction between the

to an enhancement of synergistic catalytic activity for selective aerobic

4.5. Selective photochemistry and electrochemistry

Over the decades, photocatalysts and electrocatalysts have attracted
huge attention as a method of addressing the global environmental issue
and energy crisis [501,502]. Along this line, SACs have been engaged as
promising candidates in the fields of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis
due  to  their  high  catalytic  activity,  stability,  and  pathway  selectivity
[19,503]. In recent years, SACs have been utilized for a wide range of
applications,  such  as  hydrogen  evolution,  oxygen  evolution,  CO2
reduction, pollutant removal and degradation, and chemical synthesis
[504–506].

Photocatalyst  is  a  unique  class  of  materials  that  can  accelerate
chemical reactions on exposure to a specific type of light (UV, UV–Vis, or
Visible).  Photocatalysts  offer  sustainable  and  environment-friendly
catalytic  solutions  by  utilizing  green  and  inexhaustible  solar  light  to
facilitate chemistry reactions compared to traditional thermal activation
processes. In general, photocatalysts work using the same principle as
semiconductors, when the photocatalyst is exposed to light, an electron
in the valence band can absorb the energy of photons and is excited to
the  conduction  band,  leaving  a  hole  (positive  charge)  in  the  valence
band.  Therefore,  the  electron–hole  pair  is  produced  in  this  process,
which  can  provide  both  oxidation  and  reduction  environments  to
accelerate chemical reactions [507]. Various bulk materials have shown
photocatalytic  capabilities,  including  metal  oxides  (TiO2,  V2O5,  ZnO,
Al2O3,  Fe2O3)  [508],  carbon  dots  [509],  metal–organic-frameworks
(MOFs) [510], 2D materials [511], and plasmonic metals [512]. How-
ever, current photocatalysts are facing great challenges because of fast
photogenerated  electron–hole  recombination,  limited  visible-light
response,  and  slow  electron  transport  [513].  Along  this  line,  SACs
have  emerged  as  capable  photocatalysts  that  could  be  the  answer  to

On the other hand, electrocatalyst is a type of catalyst used to in-
crease the rate of electrochemical reactions by facilitating the conver-
sion  between  electrical  and  chemical  energy  [514].  The  reaction
processing  in  electrolysis  is  dominated  by  circuit-induced  carriers,
which can drive reactions far from their equilibrium potential, enabling
access to difficult reaction pathways. Solid metals or oxide electrodes
are  usually  used  as  heterogeneous  electrocatalysts  and  the  electro-
chemical  processes  occur  at  or  near  the  liquid–solid  interface.  These
reactions  usually  include  multistep  ion/electron  coupled  electron
transfer  with  high  reaction  kinetics,  requiring  efficient  catalysts  to
accelerate the processes [515]. Homogeneous electrocatalysts are solu-
ble or dispersed in solutions, activating the reactions in the solutions.
The processes are indirect electron transfers instead of the direct elec-
tron transfer between electrode and an electrolyte. A vast array of ma-
terials has been used as electrocatalysts, including noble metals, noble
metal
and
metal-free-carbons [516–520]. Electrocatalysts have been widely used
in energy storage and conversion, metallurgy, and chemical synthesis
applications. However, a bottleneck of wide spread electrocatalyst usage
is the high cost of noble metals and low natural abundance, limiting the
large-scale  development  of  electrocatalysts.  Noble  metals  are  usually
present in the forms of nanoparticles in conventional catalysts, however,
the previous concept of efficient nanoparticles is flawed by the fact that
these are in fact to be considered bulk materials due to extended terrace
sites. Reducing the size of catalysts is an efficient method to expose more
high-energy  active  sites.  SACs  offer  promising  access  to  address  this
issue  due  to  natively  possessing  a  maximum  atom  utilization.  In  this
section, we highlight and introduce recent advances in electrocatalysis

increase  in  the  activation  energy  barrier  (Fig.  25(b)).  This  effect  was
similar  for  Pd  monolayer  but  was  the  contrary  for  Pd4Cu8/Cu(111).
From Fig. 25(c), it can be clearly seen that the Pd1–Cu(111) was showing
an exothermic reaction energy associated with low activation energy,
indicating that the oxidation reaction occurs much easier on the Pd1–Cu
(111) as compared to its counterparts. In addition, two possible reaction
pathways  related  to  COOCH3  oxidation  were  studied  through  micro-
kinetic analysis. In both pathways (Fig. 25(d and e)), the results were in
good agreement that the DMC (108.8 kJ/mol) was more favorable to be
produced compared to the DMO (192.6; 107.5 kJ/mol) due to a lower
energy barrier of the rate-determining (Fig. 25(d)). A similar observa-
tion was also depicted in Fig. 25(e) in which the activation barrier of the
Pd4Cu8/Cu(111) and Pd1–Cu(111) surfaces was 107.5 and 91.6 kJ/mol,
respectively [500].

Lately, another remarkable investigation of the synergistic effect of
tri-metals  in  a  Crown  Jewel-Structured  (IrPd)/Au  SAC  for  selective
oxidation has been revealed by Zhang and co-authors [493]. The pres-
ence of negatively charged Au and Ir atoms has elucidated two kinds of
charge transfer modes, creating a synergistic effect that enhanced the
catalytic activity of the (IrPd)/Au SACs to a maximum level. In order to
further understand the synergistic effect, a DFT analysis was performed.
The study revealed that electron transfer between O2 and anionic Au and
Ir  atoms possessed a  hydroperoxo–like  species via  donating an excess

and  photocatalysis  using  SACs,  focusing  on  applications  in  CO2  con-
version and hydrogen fuel cells (Table 8).

4.5.1. Research advances of SAC for electrochemical CO2RR

The CO2 released in the atmosphere from both large, industrial point
sources, and small, mobile sources are considered the main culprit for
global  warming.  Its  capture  and  utilization  have  received  growing
attention since it is a promising strategy for reducing its concentration in
the atmosphere, and simultaneously obtaining valuable chemicals and
fuels  [528].  However,  due  to  the  very  stable  structure  of  the  CO2
molecule, its conversion requires the utilization of catalysts. In this re-
gard,  electrocatalytic  CO2  reduction  reaction  (CO2RR)  holds  great
promise among various chemical approaches [529,530], since it can be
carried out under ambient conditions with promising activity [530]. For
this process to be environmentally friendly, the energy input should be
obtained from a renewable and non-CO2 emitting electricity source, and
combined with  the utilization of ‘green’  electrocatalysts. Noble metal
atoms are known for their superior activity, selectivity, and long-term
stability in CO2RR, but their high cost and scarcity hinder their exten-
sive use [531,532]. However, this issue is reduced in SACs, where the
metal loading is notably decreased.

catalysts  for  the  electrochemical  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide.  Since
then, SACs have been extensively explored and several other promising
SACs  for  CO2RR  have  been  proposed  [50,534,535].  Unlike  gas-phase
reactions,  electrochemical  reactions  would  have  the  additional
requirement of high-conductivity support materials, such as carbon or
doped  metal  oxide.  The  introduction  of  heteroatoms  in  the  support
matrix was found to be a useful strategy for modulating the electronic
structures  and  stabilizing  the  metal  atoms,  resulting  in  an  overall
enhanced  catalytic  activity  [536,537].  Furthermore,  the  process  of
“anchoring”  the metal atom to the support involves a charge transfer
among  the  central  metal  sites  and  the  substrate  [523].  This  type  of
metal-support interaction has been extensively investigated in SACs to
regulate the electronic structure of catalysts, which consequently affects
the intrinsic activity of active sites toward various electrocatalytic re-
actions [538]. Moreover, the local environments of the metal active sites
in  atomically  dispersed  metals  determined  the  significantly  different
behavior  between  SACs  and  their  bulk  and  nanoparticle  counterparts
[539,540]. For instance, while the bulk and nanoparticle electrodes of
Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni mainly produce H2 [540], the M(cid:0) N–C (M = Mn, Fe,
Co, Ni) SACs show great activity for the electrochemical CO2 conversion
to CO, and the suppression of the competing HER [541].

The first example of electrochemically driven CO2RR over SACs was
proposed in 1974 by Meshitsuka et al. [533] who showed that cobalt and
nickel  phthalocyanines  attached  to  graphite  electrodes  are  active

The introduction of SACs into CO2RR has yielded a high efficiency
towards  desired  fine  C1–C5  chemicals  [542,543];  notably,  SACs  have
shown promising results in boosting the catalytic conversion of CO2 up

[521]  reported  a  single-Fe-atom  catalyst  tuned  with  phosphorus
(Fe–N/P–C) on commercial carbon black as a robust electrocatalyst for
CO2  reduction (inset in Fig. 26 (a)). The single-Fe-catalyst was synthe-

studied  by  Yang  and  collaborators  [522]  who  prepared  isolated  Cu
atoms decorated ‘through-hole’ carbon nanofibers (CuSAs/TCNFs), with
abundant and homogeneously distributed Cu single atoms (CuSAs) for
efficient  electrochemical  CO2RR,  with  high  stability.  CuSAs/TCNFs

density  of  methanol.  Moreover,  the  preparation  of  the  CuSAs/TCNFs
membrane fulfills the industrial production requirements. DFT calcula-
tions  underline  that  the  desorption  of  the  adsorbed  *CO  on
CuSAs/TCNFs  model  is  slightly  endergonic,  suggesting  that  the  CO
desorption does not occur, and the *CO intermediate is further hydro-
genated  to  methanol.  In  recent  work,  Cai  and  co-workers  [523]  pro-
posed  a  carbon  dot  (CDs)-supported  SAC,  which  consists  of  a
single-Cu-atom  coordinated  to  two  N  and  two  O  sites  bound  to  the

edge of graphitic carbons (Cu-CD), as an efficient electrocatalyst for the
conversion of CO2 to CH4 (eight electron transfer process). The unique
structure  of  the  synthesized  Cu-CD  catalyst  allows  for  high  Faradaic
efficiency  of  78%,  superior  CH4  catalytic  selectivity  at  high  negative
bias, and suppression of the HER. Moreover, the limiting step for CH4
production was found to be a lower energy value than that reported in
other works.

4.5.2. Research advances of SACs for hydrogen fuel cells

Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are among the most
promising  devices  to  convert  chemical  energy  to  electrical  energy
[545–547]. In these devices, the cathode catalyzes the Oxygen Reduc-
tion Reaction (ORR), and the anode catalyzes the oxidation of fuels, such
as hydrogen (HOR). The desired ORR is a four-electron process leading
(cid:0) → 4H2O), that involves the
to the production of water (O2 + 4H+ + 4e
cleavage of the exceptionally strong O––O bond, whose bond energy is
(cid:0) 1. Therefore, in order to overcome the slow kinetics of the
498 kJ mol
ORR,  efficient  electrocatalysts  are  required.  On  the  other  hand,  the

(cid:0)
anode reaction is the hydrogen oxidation reaction (H2  → 2H+ + 2e
),
which is a relatively simpler reaction than ORR [514]. Platinum-based
materials  are  the  most  widely  used  electrocatalysts  for  both  the  ORR
and HOR in PEMFCs. However, its extension to large-scale and industrial
applications is hindered by high costs and low reserves. Based on that,
the development of non-Pt catalysts is of paramount importance. In this
regard,  the  work  of  Jasinski  [548]  on  the  ORR  activity  of  cobalt
phthalocyanine  paved  the  way  for  the  development  of  atomically
dispersed M–N–C materials, which exhibit strong ORR performance and
great potential for substituting noble metal Pt-based catalysts. DFT was
used  to  investigate  the  adsorption  energy  of  oxygen  intermediates
involved  in  the  ORR  process  on  M–N–C,  consisting  of  carbon  nano-
structures functionalized with pyridinic nitrogen atoms and transition
metals [549]. The study revealed differences of up to 0.7 eV among the
adsorption energies of the oxygen intermediates on different moieties,
which underlined the importance of precisely determining the local site
structures in M–N–C materials for understanding their reactivity.

Recently, a Cu SAC was proposed by Cui and collaborators [550].

The catalyst was prepared via a pyrolysis method using Cu phthalocy-
anine  (CuPc)  as  the  precursor  and  carbon  nanotubes  as  carriers.
Aberration-corrected  STEM  and  operando  XAS  techniques  have  been
used  to  determine  the  morphology  and  electronic  properties  of  the
catalyst. The Cu SAC showed higher ORR stability and comparable ORR
activity with respect to Pt/C in an alkaline medium, which makes this
catalyst  a  capable  non-noble  ORR  catalyst  for  fuel  cell  applications.
Moreover, DFT calculations have been performed and suggest that the
transformation process from OOH* to O* is the rate-determining step of
the ORR on the Cu SAC.

Characterization techniques such as XAS, along with computational
methods have been used to gain insights into the dynamic evolution of
active sites in operando processes, whose information is crucial for an in-
depth understanding of the catalytic behavior of SACs. For instance, Han
and  co-workers  [524]  demonstrated  the  substrate-induced  activity
improvement  of  CuN2C2  SACs  embedded  into  sp2-hybridized  carbon
graphite frameworks. Specifically, the authors state that the increase of
the geometry distortion of single-atom CuN2C2 active sites, formed when
going from a graphene-like material to a small-diameter carbon nano-
tube (CNT), leads to an improved ORR activity. Indeed, the higher strain
in CNT substrates implies a more significant distortion of the CuN2C2
moieties during the ORR, which results in strengthening the Cu–O bonds
of Cu and the oxygen atoms of the adsorbed species, while weakening
the  original  Cu–N/Cu–C  bonds.  As  a  consequence,  a  higher  electron
transfer to the adsorbed O2  molecules is achieved, thus enhancing the
ORR activity up to six-fold.

4.5.3. Recent advances of SACs for photocatalytic CO2  conversion

Photocatalytic reduction of CO2  to value-added carbon-based fuels
and chemicals is one of the most active research fields. In recent years,
SACs  have  been  developed  and  applied  extensively  as  a  new  class  of
high-efficient  catalysts  for  photocatalytic  CO2  reduction  reaction
(CO2RR), using natural sunlight as an energy source. Apart from their
high  atom  utilization,  large  specific  surface  area,  and  uniformity  of
active  sites, the heterogeneous single  atom photocatalysts have  many
other favorable features including improved energy efficiency with good
excitation  under  visible  light,  and  reducing  recombination  of  photo-
generated charges as well as high selectivity towards CO2  adsorption.
Despite  efforts  being  made  to  develop  an efficient  photocatalyst  with
high H2 generation performance, the poor visible light utilization rate,
low  quantum  yield,  severe  aggregation  of  electron  pairs  caused  by
photogenerated electrons, and its low stability are some of the barriers
and  hindrances  in  bringing  these  advanced  photocatalysts  towards
practical applications and commercialization.

An example of applying SACs for photocatalytic CO2RR was by Gao
et al. [551], two types of single atoms, palladium, and platinum, were
supported on graphitic carbon nitride and investigated as photocatalysts
for  photocatalytic  CO2RR.  From  the  DFT  calculations,  the  graphitic
carbon nitride support itself offers a source of hydrogen atom (H*) from
the  hydrogen  evolution  reaction  (HER).  The  deposition  of  Pd  and  Pt
atoms onto carbon support evidently improves the visible light absorp-
tion  performance,  which  renders  them  an  ideal  candidate  for  photo-
catalytic  CO2RR.  For  Pd  and  Pt-based  catalysts,  the  former  produces
more HCOOH as a product of CO2  reduction and the latter prefers to
form CH4 from CO2 with a much higher rate-determining barrier of 1.16
eV, as compared to that of Pd catalysts (0.66 eV). The CO2  reduction
pathways  to  HCOOH  and  CH3OH  on  Pd/g-C3N4  and  CO2  to  CH4  on
Pt/g-C3N4 catalysts were illustrated in detail, as shown in Fig. 27(a) and
(b), respectively.

Noble  metals  including Pd, Au,  and Pd  are  commonly  used as  co-
catalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2  due to their inherent
low activation energy and effective charge separation. However, such
rare elements are still considerably expensive which impedes its large-
scale  commercial  application.  Recently,  the  incorporation  of  earth-
–abundant transition metals (e.g. Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe) as an economic
alternative  for  photocatalytic  CO2RR  applications  has  sparked  great

interest among the scientific community. Chen et al. [419] designed and
developed  a  Cu  single-atom  catalyst  with  three-dimensional  ordered
mesoporous TiO2  (Cu0.01/3DOM-TiO2) from a template-assisted in-situ
pyrolysis method. The proposed synthesis strategy not only caters to a
wider light absorption range but offers some specific active sites for the
absorption and transformation of CO2 molecules via different pathways
(Fig. 27(c)). From the results, the novel single atom photocatalyst ex-
hibits a high methane selectivity of 83.3% with a formation rate of 43.5
(cid:0) 1 under a gas–solid system (Fig. 27(d i-ii)). Whereas under a
μmol g
liquid–solid system, the same single atom catalysts favored the forma-
tion of ethylene with a selectivity of 58.4% and formation rate of 6.99
(cid:0) 1  (Fig.  27(d  iii-iv))  [551].  From  the  reaction  mechanism
μmol  g
study  it  was  revealed  that  methane  is  generated  from  the  *CHO  in-
termediates in the gas–solid system while ethylene is produced as the
main product from dimerization of *CO and *CHO in the liquid–solid
system [551].

Zhang  et  al.  [526]  investigated  the  photocatalytic  performance  of
cobalt-based photocatalysts with Co single atoms isolated and anchored
on a commercial ‘super conductive’ carbon black (Co-SA@SP-800). The
as-prepared  photocatalyst  demonstrates  a  significant  improvement  in
photoactivity, CO selectivity, and cycling stability, which is mainly due
to the highly active isolated Co–N4 single atomic sites with conductive
carbon support. Considering the unique electronic structure of Co SACs
toward  photocatalytic  CO2  reduction,  Di  et  al.  [525]  introduced
ultra-thin Bi3O4Br nanosheets to isolated single atoms Co as an active
site  and  form  Co–Bi3O4Br  catalysts  for  CO2  photoreduction  reaction.
From the results, the designed catalysts exhibited an improved selective

CO formation rate of  107.1 μmol  g
higher  than  that  of  the  atomic  layered  Bi3O4Br  and  bulk  Bi3O4Br
nanoparticles, respectively [525].

Apart from cobalt-based SACs, both nickel and iron are two low-cost
earth–abundant  transition  metals  that  can  be  decorated  as  SACs  for
photocatalytic reactions. Zhang et al. [527] designed a highly efficient
photocatalytic system by dispersing single-site iron atoms and anchoring
on  a  porous  crimped  graphitic  carbon  nitride  (g-C3N4)  polymer.  Sur-
prisingly, the synergistic effect of Fe and g-C3N4 support promoted the
solar-photon-driven activities [527] and led to a higher photocatalytic
(cid:0) 1.  Similarly,  Jin  et  al.
hydrogen  generation  rate  of  3390  μmol  h
[283]  decorated  the  same  support  with  partially  oxidized  Ni  single
atoms  with  abundant  unpaired  d-electrons,  which  improved  the  ab-
sorption performance of visible light and mobility of charge carriers. As
a result, the photocatalytic H2 production rate was improved by 30-fold
as compared to that of the bulk g-C3N4  and other kinds of polymeric
semiconductors.

5. Challenges of SACs bulk production

The  unique  and  promising  features  of  SACs  have  created  a  huge
application  potential  in  many  areas.  However,  the  scalability  of  this
novel material remains a challenging barrier to mass production [14].
Several  SAC  production  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  to  achieve
maximum commercial value as shown in Fig. 28.

5.1. Scalability for large-scale application

Various synthesis methods have been considered including physical
and  chemical methods.  Despite  many SACs synthesis  methods  having
been  developed,  the  upscaling  of  laboratory  settings  into  commercial
production  has  not  been  effective  [552].  Physical  methods  require
complex and expensive equipment, while chemical methods cannot be
adapted  to  synthesize  SACs  containing  other  transition  metals  [553].
Besides, a larger-scale synthesis of SACs containing almost any transi-
tion metal with high metal loading, with a single synthetic strategy has
proven to be elusive. He et al. [169] emphasized that the fabrication cost
for  SACs  remains  feasible  for  commercial  production.  Additionally,
some experiments such as mass-selected soft-landing [554] and atomic

layer deposition [555] are hindered due to expensive experimental re-
quirements and low production efficiency. To date, the largest quantity
of SACs reported in the literature was ~1 kg under controlled laboratory
environmental  conditions  [553].  To  overcome  the  challenges  of
large-scale applications, the adoption of advanced manufacturing such
as robotics and automation, not to forget nanotechnologies as well as the
use of AI and machine learning is recommended. As such, 3D printing
provides a convenient and precise ability to design and print geomet-
rically  complex  functional  SACs  that  integrate  isolated  atom,  photo-
active and catalytic functionalities.

properties can improve the stability, selectivity, and activity of the SACs.
Jing Liu et al. [479] stated that many researchers have experimentally
demonstrated the application of support materials such as noble metal
oxides and 2D materials  to synthesize SACs. Despite the size of these
metallic atoms, not all atoms are located on the surface of the catalyst
and hence, are not fully accessible to the reactant. Complete accessibility
can only be achieved if every single atom is well dispersed and stabilized
on the support. Also, the functional groups and defects on the support
surface can develop different SAC structures which can affect the sta-
bility of SAC. The selection of support material might be challenging for
the mass production of SACs.

5.2. Development of SAC support material

The performance of SACs can vary with the support material. Su et al.
[556] highlighted that the limited diversity of support material for SACs
has led to a narrow range of active site structures. Many works on the
investigation  of  carbon-based  support  materials  for  SACs  have  been
performed. The support material does not only create a strong bonding
between  metal  atoms  and  the  support  surface,  but  it  also  affects  the
support  for  atom  anchoring  sites  to  stabilize  the  metal  atoms  [557].
Besides, the support material can improve the catalytic reaction as well.
Cheng  et  al.  [552]  emphasized  that  a  support  material  with  a  high
surface  area  and  a  large  number  of  anchoring  sites  can  synthesize
high-loading  SACs.  In  addition,  the  surface  material  with  these

5.3. Stability of SAC under actual working environment

To produce SACs on a commercial scale, the stability performance of
SACs needs to be addressed. Cheng et al. [552] emphasized the stabili-
zation of supported highly dispersed single atoms during catalysis can be
challenging  due  to  high  surface-free  energy  and  low  coordination
numbers of single atoms. With the consideration of the dynamic oper-
ation conditions, the stability of SACs can be influenced by many factors
such as temperature, pressure, support material, surface condition, and
reactant [558]. Mostly, in harsh reaction conditions, SACs will undergo
loss of active sites under particle migration and coalescence and atomic
(or  Ostwald)  ripening  deactivation  [559].  In  order  to  prolong  the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10107441

A.C.M. Loy et al.

lifespan  and  stability  of  the  SACs,  utilizing  colloidal  nanocrystals  to
independently control particle size and particle loading on the SAC is
desired. However, it is very challenging to isolate a clear and precise
mechanism of different species of SAC in specific reactions, due to a lack
of studies in literatures. In short, further research and understanding of
the  stabilization  of  SACs  under  dynamic  working  environments  is
required prior to large-scale application.

5.4. Operando characterization of SAC

In the synthesis of SACs, the characterization methods are essential
in determining the quality of the SAC. With the advancement in SACs,
advanced characterization equipment is necessary such as STM, EXAFS,
AC-STEM, and often DRIFTS [552]. These forms of characterization are
in-situ methods of determining the structure of a SAC, while it undergoes
its chemical reaction. Li et al. [560] highlighted that the in-situ methods
can capture the reaction intermediates, identify active sites, and monitor
dynamic behaviors of both geometric structure and electronic environ-
ment of catalytic sites. However, Li et al. [560] added that most of the
in-situ  methods  are  performed  only  for  the  characterization  of  SACs
without  simulating  catalytic  activity,  simultaneously.  Moreover,  each
characterization method has its advantage and limitation. Therefore, a
detailed  SAC  characterization  under  dynamic  operating  conditions
required  the  integration  of  in-situ  characterization  techniques  to
discover the characterization of SACs under dynamic conditions. Addi-
tionally, the cost of the characterization of SACs can be expensive before
the characteristics of SACs can be fully validated for commercial use.

6. Economic and environmental aspects

As  previously  mentioned,  the  utilization  of  SACs  in  energy  and

chemical applications is still in its infancy (works are mainly at a lab-
scale  where  pilot  testing  and prototyping  are  still pending), in  which
the  Technology  Readiness  Level  (TRL)  is  currently  between  1  and  3
[561].  To  date,  there  is  no  literature  reporting  on  economic  or  envi-
ronmental analyses of SACs in any applications. Thus, in order to pro-
vide  an  overview  of  the  commercialization  feasibility  of  SACs,  this
review article also provides preliminary economic and environmental
analyses based on the available resources and information. The assess-
ment portfolio was made based on the catalyst synthesis cost, production
cost, CO2 emission factor, and lifespan of the catalysts (they are ordered
clockwise  based  on  increasing  CO2  emissions).  This  representation
highlights that the economic metric does not correlate with the envi-
ronmental impact. Nevertheless, these findings, it is sufficient to identify
the most attractive and potential catalyst, as reported in many research
articles [562,563].

The first step of this investigation was the selection of possible re-
action which offers suitable characteristics for integration. Based on the
data  available,  the  selected  reaction  was  dry  reforming  of  methane
(DRM, Figure S1) and six individual case studies were chosen based on
the  catalyst  types,  noted  as  (A)  Ni-based  SAC  [369];  (B)  Ni/Al2O3
derived  from  Metal–Organic  Framework  (MIL-53)  [564];  (C)  Ni/A-
l2O3–CeO2 [565]; (D) Ni/TNT [566]; (E) Ni/Al2O3 [565] and (F) Pure Ni
[567] (note that H2  is considered as the targeted product). The calcu-
lations step and assumptions used are  included in the  Supplementary
information (Tables S1-S8). As presented in Fig. 29, the Ni-based SAC
(Ni/HAP-Ce) was the most preferred catalyst for DRM, in terms of both
being  environmentally  friendly  and  economical.  According  to  the
greater  details  stated  in  the  supplementary  information,  the  cost  of
preparation  for  Ni/HAP-Ce  via  co-precipitation  was  found  to  be  the
lowest among other counterparts, also, noteworthy to mention that, the
cost was about 3.5 times lower than that of the Ni-MOF. In addition, the

total production cost (USD/kg H2) of Ni-SACs was also calculated to be
the lowest compared to other catalysts, which is 26.4% and 1.23% lower
than pure Ni (Worst) and Ni-MOF (2nd Best), respectively. Whereas the
environmental matrix is measured in terms of CO2 emissions (kg CO2/kg
H2  produced).  Notably,  the  CO2  emissions  in  catalytic  DRM  using  a
Ni-SAC are far lower than other catalysts, i.e., in the range of 2.3–7.5
times  lower  as  compared  to  that  of  other  catalysts.  Overall,  given  its
promising  performance  in  the  studied  aspects  (economic,  environ-
mental, and lifespan), SACs emerge as an attractive frontier catalyst to
be  exploited  further  too  aid  the  commercialization  purpose  and
strengthen other chemicals and fuel production routes. Future work on
conducting rigorous “Integrated Economic, Environmental, and Energy”
assessments (3Es) is required to further provide a bigger picture of the

frontier of SACs, these assessments could provide decision makers in the
commercialization process with feasibility data in determining the most
favourable  synthesis  method  of  SACs  and  also  suggesting  the  future
research direction, challenges, and debottlenecking of the application of
SACs in different field.

7. Concluding remarks and future Perspective

The performance of SACs has gained attention in many sectors as the
new frontier in catalysis science, especially in clean energy. This paper
highlights the development of SAC synthesis methods from conventional
(i.e., co-precipitation or sequential incipient wetness impregnation) to
new  synthesis  methods  (i.e.,  coordination  site,  defect  design,

photochemical and electrochemical). As the development of SAC syn-
thesis  is  improved,  advanced  characterization  methods  such  as  high-
resolution electron microscopes, x-ray irradiation spectroscopies, mag-
netic resonance spectroscopies, and other wavelength in-situ spectros-
copies  are  used  to  provide  an  in-depth  understanding  of  the
characteristics of the SAC for clean energy application. On top of that,
recent SAC experimental outcomes are reviewed with the consideration
of operating conditions, catalyst loading, and types of reactor configu-
rations. Based on the experimental and DFT method output, SACs appear
to  be  an  alternative  to  bridge  both  homogeneous  and  heterogenous
catalysts  for  clean  energy  applications  including  coupling,  oxidation,
hydrogenation, and reforming reactions. Through the nano-engineering
strategy,  bulk nanoparticle catalysts can be downsized by using large
surface  area  support  materials,  both  the  surface  area  and  density  of
defect  sites are favorable for  the incorporation of single  atoms of the
active  metal,  providing  some  unique  catalytic  performance  such  as
higher  stability  and  flexible  physiochemical  properties.  Besides  that,
studies  demonstrated  that  SAC  contributes  to  lowering  the  reaction
activation barrier, enhancing adsorption pathways, processing uniform
single active sites, and governing catalytic reactivity for selective routes.
The  commercialization  and  large-scale  production  of  SACs  require
addressing various key challenges including the utilization of affordable
support materials, stability of SACs under a mass production environ-
ment, and introducing of simple and effective in-situ characterization
methods. From this review, it can be observed that the application of
SACs  is  at  the  forefront  of  clean  energy  and  chemicals  production
research, offering strategic alternatives to classical heterogeneous cat-
alytic  systems  with  a  major  impact  on  the  economy  and  the
environment.
