This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in catalytic processes to convert methane (a major component
of natural gas) to more valuable hydrocarbons as fuels or chemicals. The scope is restricted to “direct”
conversion, meaning that processes involving synthesis gas as an intermediate are not considered. Oxy-
genated products (e.g., alcohols) are also not considered. In all cases, the processes are concerned with
catalytic dehydrogenation. The two most widely studied processes are oxidative coupling of methane
(OCM) and methane dehydroaromatization (MDA). After reviewing the relevant catalysis literature, the
paper goes on to review reactor implementations. Hydrogen- and/or oxygen-permeable membranes can
potentially play valuable roles in improving methane conversion and product yields. Despite over 30 years
of research, there are still no direct-conversion processes that can compete commercially with methane
reforming followed by processes such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. Thus, the future practical develop-
ment and deployment of OCM and MDA will rely on the research and development of advanced catalysts
and innovative processes. The present review helps to document the foundation on which the needed
development can build.

1. Introduction

The growing availability of low-cost and domestically sourced
natural gas leads to increased interest in its conversion to more-
valuable fuels and chemicals. Although natural gas is a mixture of
small hydrocarbons and other components such as sulfur com-
pounds, the dominant component is methane. This review focuses
on the conversion of methane alone, where numerous research and
development challenges remain to be met and overcome. To narrow
the scope even further, the review is particularly concerned with
the direct conversion of methane to hydrocarbons, not to oxygen-
ated products such as alcohols or intermediates such as synthesis
gas (i.e., CO and H2). The term direct conversion here refers to the
processes that do not involve the intermediate production of syn-
thesis gas. In other words, “direct” means that reforming agents (i.e.,
H2O and/or CO2) are not added, or are added in very low levels that
are not intended as reforming agents. Such low-level reforming
agents can also be produced as reaction intermediates within the
process, and can participate in some reforming chemistry within
a so-called “direct” process. Previous authors have used a similar
definition [1,2].

Essentially all such direct methane conversions require dehy-
drogenation, with details depending on the desired products. Because
its regular tetrahedron structure forms a perfectly symmetric zero
dipole moment, methane is a very stable molecule. Without any
functional groups to facilitate the chemical attacks, methane acti-
vation requires breaking a strong C—H bond (approximately
439 kJ mol−1). Thus, elevated temperatures are necessary. Al-
though still considered to be high-temperature processes, catalysts
can decrease reaction temperatures to approximately 800 °C and
lower. Despite the potential value of direct dehydrogenation

processes and despite considerable fundamental research, practi-
cal, commercially viable, technology remains elusive.

This review is concerned primarily with aspects of oxidative cou-
pling of methane (OCM) and methane dehydroaromatization (MDA)
[3–9]. Particular topics range from catalyst performance to inno-
vative reactor design and development. The development and
integration of permselective membranes can be important aspects
of process intensification and reactor development.

A wide range of chemicals could be produced from methane. This
paper focuses on the processes to form small hydrocarbons with
aliphatic, olefinic, or aromatic content. The processes considered all
involve ethylene formation, which may be an intermediate com-
ponent to produce compounds with higher olefin, paraffin, and
aromatic (e.g., benzene) content. Oligomerization of ethylene can
produce higher olefins that could be used in gasoline (C5—C10) or
in diesel fuel (C10—C20). The higher olefins can also be converted to
paraffins via catalytic hydrogenation processes [10,11], leading to
constituents needed for energy-dense fuels. Of course, ethylene itself
is already a valuable chemical feedstock from numerous down-
stream processes. Oxygenates (e.g., methanol, ethanol) are not within
this paper’s scope.

Processes such as Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) have been practiced com-
mercially for decades. In this case, the methane is first catalytically
reformed or partially oxidized to produce synthesis gas (primarily
a mixture of H2 and CO). The synthesis gas is then further pro-
cessed to deliver a wide range of hydrocarbon or oxygenated
products. However, assuming that a hydrocarbon product is desired,
the sequence of first oxidizing to syngas and then reducing to the
product has inherent inefficiencies. Nevertheless, despite any such
inefficiencies, these processes are practical and industrially viable
[12].

Direct conversion of methane to ethylene as well as further oligo-
merization and hydrogenation are all proven concepts. Ethylene
oligomerization is an industrial-scale process, first developed by Shell
in 1977 [10]. In that process, the ethylene is produced via a F–T
process. However, despite substantial efforts in the last three decades,
direct conversion of methane to ethylene requires improvements
to be commercially successful.

In recent years, several patented technologies have been devel-
oped with the objective of commercializing gas-to-liquids (GTL)
processes. Siluria Technologies [13] is apparently in the process of
upscaling a pilot plant to produce ethylene as a precursor for lo-
gistic fuels. A large European Union framework program (2009–
2014) focused on developing fully integrated processes for oxidative
coupling of methane, where ethylene also served as a precursor for
liquid logistic fuels. A number of alternative catalysts, processes, and
reactors were investigated to demonstrate a proof of concept for
ethylene to liquid fuels [14]. Nevertheless, despite significant efforts,
these processes have not yet achieved commercial viability.

Direct methane conversion faces a number of significant chal-

lenges, including:

• thermodynamically limited conversion,
• catalyst selectivity to desired products,
• catalyst deactivation via carbon deposits.

Membranes and membrane reactors can play important roles in

mitigating the obstacles associated with direct conversion.

Consider, for example, methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) to

produce benzene, which may be represented globally as

In both cases, the extent of methane conversion is thermody-
namically limited by hydrogen accumulation within the reactor. In
other words, the reaction can equilibrate with only a fraction of the
methane being converted. Ideally, a hydrogen-permeable mem-
brane that selectively removes H2 can promote increased conversion
and product yield.

Although reactions (1) and (2) represent desired global results,
no actual processes can achieve such ideal outcomes. Catalysts must
be designed and fabricated to be as selective as possible. However,
even with the best catalysts, numerous side products are inevita-
bly produced. Although membranes can usually increase conversion,
they can also affect (both favorably and unfavorably) the selectiv-
ity to the desired products and a wide range of undesired side
products. Undesired side products often include catalyst-fouling coke
precursors and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) deposits. Mem-
branes can play important roles in limiting or controlling the
production of these unwanted and damaging products.

1.1. Catalysts

Today, more than 90% of all transportation fuels at some point
during their production have passed over at least one catalyst. Some
80% of all chemical products are manufactured with the aid of ca-
talysis and more than 20% of all industrial products rely on catalytic
reaction technology [15].

Catalysts decrease activation barriers by altering reaction path-
ways, including the production of alternative species that may not
be formed via gas-phase chemistry. Catalyst performance is usually
governed by active sites on the catalyst surface. For example, noble

metals (Rh, Pt, Ru, Pd) are effective reforming catalysts. Iron- and
chromium-oxides are effective for F–T synthesis. Some processes
require catalytic bi-functionality, meaning two different catalytic
groups fractionalize sequential reactions. For example, Mo/zeolite
catalysts are effective for methane dehyroaromatization (MDA). In
this case, methane is activated on Mo2C sites, primarily forming
C2H4 and H2. The C2H4 is further oligomerized and cyclized at
Brønsted acid sites on the zeolite, forming benzene, toluene, and
naphthalene.

Effective catalysts must enable desired reactions to proceed at
suitable rates under conditions that are technologically desirable
(e.g., at low temperature and pressure). Low temperature and pres-
sure usually decrease design and operational complexity, thus
decreasing the production cost and promoting safe operating en-
vironments. Achieving catalyst selectivity to desired product mixtures
is a major objective. Undesired products (e.g., solid carbon and PAH)
not only decrease the product yield but can also cause catalyst deg-
radation and deactivation. Separating desired products from
undesired side products can involve significant technical complexi-
ties and production costs, usually as downstream processes.

Effective catalysts should have structural integrity and chemi-
cal stability. Structural and mechanical integrity is important because
catalysts can fracture under harsh operating conditions (e.g., acidic
environments, high pressures). Chemical stability is important to
prevent deleterious transformation of catalytically active surface sites.
Impurities in reactant streams can poison the catalyst surfaces by
strong adsorption on active sides, thus preventing desired adsorp-
tion of the reactants. For example, sulfur compounds are known to
poison platinum and palladium catalysts. It is often possible to re-
generate degraded or deactivated catalysts. However, doing so
requires additional non-productive processes and time, increasing
operational and production costs.

High-performance catalysts need to present readily accessible
high surface areas to the reactant gases. Typical catalyst struc-
tures are formed as particles or pellets that are housed in packed-
bed or washcoat configurations. In packed beds, gases flow around
relatively large catalyst particles or pellets, which also have micro-
and nano-scale pore structures that further increase active surface
area. Washcoat structures are usually formed as thin layers (order
of tens of microns) on the walls of millimeter-scale channels in
monolithic structures or microchannel reactors [16,17]. Especially
with expensive noble-metal catalysts, it is important to design porous
microstructures such that the active sites are readily accessible to
the reactants.

1.2. Temperature and pressure tradeoffs

Essentially all processes that involve methane activation require
elevated temperature (i.e., ≥ 700 °C). However, operating pressure
can vary, depending on the particular process and its integration
with upstream and downstream processing requirements. For
example, industrial-scale methane reformers often operate at el-
evated pressure (20 ≤ p ≤ 40 bar), primarily to avoid the post-
reforming compression of high temperature gases to be supplied
to downstream processes that require high pressure (Fisher–
Tropsh synthesis). High pressure actually compromises the
performance of the reformation process. The design of particular
chemical processes often depends on the integration with related
processes, seeking overall optimal performance.

Similar to the methane reforming processes, the MDA process
requires high temperatures and favors low pressure due to Le
Châtelier’s principle. MDA process is thermodynamically limited.
Even at 700 °C and 1 bar, methane conversion is limited around 12%
and the benzene yield is limited to approximately 8% [18]. Increas-
ing pressure to 4 bar decreases methane conversion to 7%, and by
10 bar methane conversion is reduced to approximately 5.5%.

Increasing temperature to 900 °C increases the methane conver-
sion to approximately 40%. However, the higher temperature favors
the undesired formation of naphthalene over the desired benzene.
Additionally, higher temperatures promote carbon deposits and ac-
celerated catalyst fouling. Unlike reforming processes, MDA processes
do not require reforming agents (H2O, CO and CO2) that tend to sup-
press carbon deposits. However, introducing low levels of H2O (≤2%),
CO and CO2 (≤10%) can be beneficial but not fully eliminate catalyst-
fouling carbon deposits. In isolation, an MDA reactor should operate
at temperatures and pressures as low as possible.

The OCM process is significantly different from MDA. Methane
conversion is limited by oxygen availability, with the process being
oxygen mass-transport limited. Although increasing oxygen in the
feed stream increases methane conversion, it also favors unde-
sired total oxidation rather than the desired C2 formation. The global
rate OCM reaction (2CH4 + O2 → C2H4 + 2H2O) is mole-neutral. Thus,
at comparable residence times, increasing pressure has a negligi-
ble effect on the methane conversion. However, because the OCM
process competes with total oxidation, increasing pressure in-
creases methane conversion rate toward to total oxidation products
and significantly decrease the C2 yield. Although increasing tem-
perature can increase the C2 selectivity, catalyst stability is a major
concern.

1.3. Membranes

A variety of membranes can play potentially beneficial roles in
methane-conversion technology. In dehydrogenation processs,
hydrogen-permeable membranes such as palladium or palladium-
alloy membranes may be relevant. A variety of dense-ceramic
ion-conducting membranes are also relevant. The proton-conducting
ceramics are typically doped pervoskites (e.g., BaZr Y O
−δ, BZY10),
.
0 9 0 1 3
which are usually mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIEC). De-
pending on the particular membrane material, these ceramics may
also have significant oxide-ion conductivity. In some cases, the
material may also have significant electronic conductivity. Because
of the required high temperatures for methane activation, polymer-
based membranes are usually not relevant and not considered
here.

.

Depending on the conversion process, the membranes may be
hydrogen permeable, oxygen permeable, or a combination of both.
Fig. 1 illustrates two possible membrane-reactor configurations. In

Fig. 1. Illustration of a shell-and-tube membrane reactors. (a) The left-hand reactor
uses a hydrogen-permeable such as for an MDA process. (b) The right-hand reactor
uses an oxygen-permeable membrane as for an ethylene-production process.

both cases, a packed-bed catalyst fills the annular space outside of
a central sweep tube. The sweep tube is configured as a porous
support, with a thin (order of tens of microns) membrane applied
to the outer surface. The left-hand reactor illustrates a hydrogen-
permeable membrane, such as might be used for an MDA process.
In this case, hydrogen is transported from the catalyst bed, through
the membrane, and into the sweep tube. Ideally, by reducing the
hydrogen concentration within the catalyst bed, the thermody-
namic equilibrium shifts in favor of increasing methane conversion
and benzene yield (cf., Eq. (1)). However, as discussed subse-
quently, the benzene yield may not always increase because of
competition with the production of undesired side products such
as naphthalene, toluene, or higher aromatics.

As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the membrane transports only hydro-
gen. A palladium membrane would deliver such performance.
However, a ceramic mixed-conducting membrane can perform dif-
ferently. Materials such yttrium- and cerium-doped barium
zirconates (BCZY) can simultaneously transport both protons and
oxide ions [19]. Depending on the sweep-gas and catalyst-bed com-
position, the net effect can be hydrogen leaving the catalyst bed and
steam entering the catalyst bed. Because steam can react with
deleterious side products such as naphthalene, ceramic MIEC mem-
branes can offer potentially significant advantages compared to pure
hydrogen-permeable membranes.

Fig. 1b illustrates an oxygen-permeable membrane. Even in non-
oxidative processes, low levels of oxygen onto the catalyst can be
beneficial, including promotion of methane activation and prefer-
ential mitigation of carbon deposits. However, it should be
emphasized that only low oxygen fluxes are relevant. If too much
oxygen enters the catalyst bed, then undesired reforming or com-
plete oxidation can dominate. In dehydrogenation processes, H2 is
readily available within the catalyst bed. Thus, under most circum-
stances, the oxygen (or oxide ions in the case of ion-transport
membranes) emerging from the membrane reacts rapidly to produce
H2O.

Typically, the oxygen and methane are premixed before
entering the catalyst bed. However, there are potential benefits
associated with oxygen-permeable membranes that deliver oxygen
along the length of the bed (e.g., Fig. 1b). One approach is to use
porous-alumina tubular structures. Another approach uses dense
ceramic oxide-ion-conducting membranes such as La1−xCaxFeO3−δ
(LCF).

Certain dense-ceramic ion-conducting membranes offer the pos-
sibility of control via electrical polarization. Ceramic membranes
with low electronic conductivity compared to ionic conductivity
can be polarized in the sense of using an external circuit to impose
an electrostatic potential across the membrane. Yttria-stabilized
zirconia (YSZ) is such a material, with good oxide-ion mobility but
very little electronic conductivity. Such membranes are widely used
in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and electrolyzers (SOEC). Doped
barium cerates and zirconates have proton mobility, but relatively
low electronic conductivity [20]. An applied electrostatic poten-
tial serves to mediate (accelerate or retard) the electronically charged
ion fluxes through the membrane. Electrodes that are spatially seg-
mented along the length of the reactor provide an opportunity to
locally control the fluxes through the membrane. However, because
the ion conductivity of the ceramic membranes is relatively low,
there can be substantial electrical costs associated with the polar-
ization control.

Sections 6 and 7 discuss membrane materials and membrane

reactor technologies in more detail.

1.4. Processes

This review concentrates on catalytic processes involving the
initial conversion of methane to ethylene, and subsequently to gas
mixtures with aliphatic and aromatic content. Broadly speaking, the
processes may be oxidative or non-oxidative. However, in the oxi-
dative case, this review is not concerned with reforming or partial
oxidation to synthesis gas or the production of oxygenated com-
pounds such as alcohols. The first sections of the paper are primarily
concerned with reviewing and discussing alternative catalysts and
catalytic processes. The following sections are concerned primar-
ily with reactor design and performance. An important aspect of
the paper is the consideration of membranes and membrane reactors.

1.5. Prior reviews on methane conversion

Direct conversion of methane to valuable chemical products has
been the subject of several previous review articles. Because the topic
involves a wide range of processes (oxidative, non-oxidative), prod-
ucts (aliphatic, aromatic, oxygenates), reactor concepts (flow reactors,
membrane coupled flow reactors) and catalysts, some of the reviews
are specific to subtopics.

A 2003 review by Choudhary et al. [21] considered the direct con-
version of methane under non-oxidative conditions. They addressed
some of the main challenges associated with direct conversion, such
as thermodynamic limitations and catalyst deactivation resulting
in low yield. A 2014 review by Tang et al. [7] focused on methane
activation either by high temperature or via oxygenates. Their review
concluded that among the oxidative and non-oxidative conver-
sion routes, non-oxidative processes such as methane to ethylene
and aromatics are promising future technologies.

In 2013, Majhi et al. [22] reviewed the methane dehydroaro-
matization (MDA) process with a specific focus on Mo/zeolite
catalysts, catalyst preparation methods, operating conditions
(i.e., temperature and pressure), and reaction pathways. Their review
discussed catalyst deactivation as a major technological impedi-
ment. They also discussed the effects of doping 2–3% noble metals
into Mo/zeolite catalysts, increasing benzene yield and catalyst sta-
bility. Also in 2013, Ma et al. [6] reviewed MDA processes. That
review discussed key technologies for process up-scaling, includ-
ing catalyst development and hydrogen-permeable membranes.

Mamonov et al. [23] published another 2013 review on methane
dehydroaromatization, concentrating on Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts. This
review concentrated on physical and chemical properties of the cat-
alyst, including the structure of active sites, chemical mechanisms,
and deactivation processes. The paper suggested approaches for im-
proving catalytic activity, such as a second-metal doping.

Spivey and Hutchings [9] reviewed the status of MDA chemis-
try as of 2014. The primary focus of that review was on catalysts
and catalytic reactor designs. Thermodynamic limitations, coke for-
mation, and rapid catalyst deactivation were identified as significant
problems. The review suggested that computational modeling would
likely play a major role in understanding the catalytic chemistry and
mitigating the deactivation problems.

Numerous studies have been published on the direct conver-
sion of methane via oxidative processes, especially concentrating
on catalyst research [4,5,8,24,25]. Zavyalova et al. [4] published an
extensive review of the OCM catalysts, including the effects of metals
and metal doping. A 2012 review by Takanabe [5] that reported the
status of OCM processes, emphasizing the importance of develop-
ing alternative catalysts that improve ethylene selectivity.

Usachev et al. [3] published a 2009 review that focused on oxi-
dative processes for small alkanes, including the oxidative coupling
of methane. That review identified the primary challenges as being
low selectivity, low C2 yield, catalyst stability, coke formation, and
temperature control. Integration with oxygen-permeable membranes

was discussed in the context of improving thermal control and
C2 yield.

Liu et al. [26] published a 2001 review that concentrated on
membrane-coupled methane-conversion processes, with a specif-
ic focus on protonic and mixed-conducting membrane reactors. Low
hydrogen or oxygen fluxes through the membranes were identi-
fied as important drawbacks for the membrane technology. The
paper suggested that the successful development of ultra-thin in-
organic hollow-fiber perovskite membranes would play important
roles in increasing the ion fluxes. Other reviews generally come to
similar conclusions [27–31]. There are certainly opportunities for
developing new high-performance membranes, seeking to in-
crease and control fluxes and to improve chemical and mechanical
stability.

Compared with membrane-coupled oxidative processes, MDA
processes coupled with hydrogen-permeable membranes are much
less mature. Although removing hydrogen from the product stream
increases methane conversion, it also tends to increase carbon de-
posits and catalyst deactivation rates. Hydrogen removal can also
promote selectivity toward unwanted polyaromatic hydrocar-
bons, thus competing with the desired benzene yield. Although
limited to only a few studies, there is growing interest in oxygen
membrane coupled MDA processes [32,33]. However, to date there
are no published reviews in this area.

2. Oxidative conversion of methane

In the early 1980s, Keller and Bhasin [34] first introduced the
concept of direct conversion of methane to ethylene, written glob-
ally as Eq. (3). Methane was first activated by oxygen in the absence
of a catalyst at temperatures above 800 °C. The process was later
called oxidative coupling of methane (OCM).

Assuming that the OCM process behaves as shown by Eq. (3),
the downstream H2O separation is straightforward by condensa-
tion. However, together with the desired C2H4, the process also yields
considerable levels of C2H6 and low levels of higher hydrocarbons
(e.g., C3H6, C3H8). Unfortunately, significant levels of undesired ox-
idation products CO, CO2, and H2O are also formed, thus decreasing
the desired C2+ selectivity. Moreover, the CO and CO2 separations
from ethylene can be difficult.

All practically viable OCM processes depend on a catalyst. High
reaction temperatures (i.e., T ≥ 700 °C) are generally necessary to ac-
tivate methane. However, with recent advances in catalyst
technologies, significant conversion and yield can be obtained at
somewhat lower reaction temperatures as well. The methane con-
version is controlled by the oxygen concentration in the mixture.
The formation of side products is associated with the high reac-
tion temperature because the total oxidation of CH4 and C2 (C2H4
and C2H6) are favored at high temperatures. The formation of side
products not only decreases the product yield, but also introduces
additional downstream gas-separation costs.

To date, despite considerable research, no particular catalyst has
emerged that fully meets practical industrial and economic require-
ments. Two important challenges remain to be overcome. The first
is the catalyst selectivity and the second is catalyst deactivation as
a function of time-on-stream. Several reviews of OCM catalysts and
processes have been published [3,24,35]. The 2015 review by
Kondratenko et al. [36] explores OCM catalyst and process design.
Economic analyses suggest commercial viability demands single-
pass C2H4 yields that exceed 25% [37,38].

Broadly speaking, OCM catalysts and processes can be catego-
rized as being either high- and low-temperature processes. Most
of the literature considers high-temperature catalysis (T ≥ 700 °C).
The low-temperature processes appear to hold promise, but are rel-
atively new and undeveloped. High temperature catalysts include
Li/MgO, Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2, and Sr/La2O3.

2.1. Li/MgO catalyst

Li/MgO catalysts were first developed by Ito et al. in 1985 [39].
Although the ethylene yield was considered to be good (≈12% C2),
it did not meet the economic expectations of 25% C2+ single-pass
yield [40]. Another problem was catalyst stability, with significant
Li loss after long time-on-stream [41]. An electron microscopy study
by Myrach et al. [42] revealed that Li/MgO undergoes morpholog-
ical changes under OCM operating conditions. Above 427 °C, Li
segregates and above 777 °C Li desorbs from the MgO. Because there
is a strong relationship between the Li loss and the catalyst deac-
tivation, early findings by Lunsford and colleagues [39,43] and Peng
et al. [44] concluded that the catalytically active center was Li+O−.
Both research groups supported their findings with the experimen-
tal surface characterization techniques,
including electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [39,43] and X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) [44] Recently, Kwapien et al. [45] published a density
functional theory (DFT) model that supported the idea of morpho-
logical change. However, unlike the early conclusions, more recent
studies find no indication of Li+O− formation, suggesting that the
active center is not Li+O− but rather oxygen-centered radicals on metal
oxides (e.g., Mg2+O2−) [45].

Despite substantial research efforts, the exact structure of the
Li/MgO and its relationship to the catalytic activity remain unclear
[25]. There continues to be considerable experimental and theo-
retical research focused on Li/MgO [46–48]. Compared to other mixed
oxides, Li/MgO has a relatively simple microstructure. With only one
active center, catalyst preparation and theoretical studies are more
easily accomplished than they are with other more complex alter-
natives. However, the poor stability limits the practical use of Li/MgO
as an OCM catalyst.

2.2. Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst

Two reviews on the family of Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts were
published in 2012 by Takanabe [5] and Arndt et al. [49]. This class
of catalyst is expected to deliver practical OCM performance.

In 1992 Fang et al. [50] first reported a mixed-oxide catalyst in
the form of Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2. They reported 23.9% C2 yield at 800 °C
in a packed-bed reactor. The active metals in Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 cata-
lysts are Mn, Na, and W. There are also synergic effects with the SiO2
supports. Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts can produce higher C2 yield
compared to Li/MgO and they are more stable at high tempera-
ture. However, they are much complicated to understand in terms
of structural and chemical complexity and active centers. Elemen-
tal composition and relative loadings, as well as the catalyst
preparation techniques, play critical roles in the catalytic activity
[51–55]. The final chemical composition is a mixed oxide, that con-
tains MnO2, Mn2O3, MnWO4 and Na2WO4 and SiO2 [54]. The synthesis
process leads to the formation of bulk oxides. However, the cata-
lyst undergoes further chemical and physical changes under OCM
conditions. Amorphous silica undergoes a phase transformation to
α-cristobalite. Amorphous silica behaves as a total oxidation cata-
lyst whereas α-cristobalite is essentially inert. Surface reconstruction
also occurs among the metal oxides and the silica [56]. All these
dynamic changes make fundamental understanding and catalyst op-
timization difficult [57–63].

Numerous theories have been proposed about the catalytic active
center for Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2. Broadly speaking, two distinct theo-
ries arise. The theory proposed by Lunsford and colleagues suggested
that the active site contains Na—O—Mn species. The Mn was ex-
pected to be responsible for activation of gas-phase oxygen, the Na
was essential for preventing the total oxidation of methane, and W
was claimed to be controlling the stability of the catalyst [57]. Using
XPS, laser Raman spectroscopy, and XRD diffraction, this theory was
later supported by Green and coworkers [61,62].

An alternative theory, based on the XRD and Raman spectra
analysis, suggested that that the catalyst undergoes a surface re-
construction. Surface clusters including W=O and W—O—Si species
are expected to be the active centers that control methane activa-
tion as well as C2 selectivity. The Mn was suggested to increase the
mobility of surface lattice oxygen [58,61,64]. Bulk metal oxides
(MnO2, Na2WO4) are expected to be physically unstable because their
melting points are below 700 °C. Thus, it is more reasonable to
believe that the a MnWO4 related bulk oxide is responsible for the
active center formation.

Processes based on Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts require operat-
ing temperatures around 800 °C and higher. Although recent
advances show that the economical goal of 25% single pass yield
can be achieved with Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2, the long-term catalyst sta-
bility remains a concern at these elevated temperatures.

Hiyoshi and Ikeda considered increasing OCM activity by mixing
Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts with alkali chlorides (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CsC)
[55]. Doping the catalyst with an equimolar mixture of NaCl and
KCl increased the ethylene yield up to 31% at 750 °C. The catalytic
performance was measured in a packed-bed reactor at atmospher-
ic pressure. Although the paper noted that alkali chlorides are volatile
at OCM reaction temperatures, stability data were not reported.

Mahmodi et al. [65] prepared M/Na/Mn/SiO2-based nanocatalysts,
where “M” represents a metal. By incorporating different metals
> ) into the structure, a maximum C2 yield
( M W Mo Nb Cr V
of 31.6% was reported at 775 °C and 1 bar in a packed-bed reactor.
The gas phase species were measured by online gas chromatogra-
phy. However, the catalysts were unstable after 9 h on stream, with
the deactivation being apparently due to the loss of catalytic surface
area by sintering. In a related approach, Ha et al. [66] patented a
composition of NaW/MnO2/SiO2 with 3.5 wt.% NaW, 1.3 wt.% MnO2
(remainder SiO2) catalyst and showed 18.4% C2 yield at 800 °C. This
catalyst was found to be durable even after 40 h of operation. Cat-
alyst screening experiments were carried out in a packed-bed reactor,
and the effects of gas-hourly space velocity and fuel/oxygen ratio
were tested.

A 2011 patent by Zarrinpashne et al. [67] reported significant
increases in C2 yield. The catalyst, which was prepared by either co-
precipitation or impregnation techniques, contained 1.9 wt.% Nb,
2 wt.% Mn, 1.8 wt.% Na, 2.8 wt.% W, with a SiO2 support. An ethyl-
ene yield of 27.24% was reported at 850 °C in a packed-bed reactor.
Substitution of Nb into the Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 structure was shown
to have a promotional effect on the C2 yield.

2.3. La2O3 catalyst

Another potentially viable OCM catalyst is La2O3. The catalytic
activity can be increased by doping with alkaline-earth metals (Sr,
Mg, Ca), which produces strong basic sites [68–70]. Early studies
indicated that Sr doping showed the most promising OCM activity
[71–73]. Choudhary et al. [70] reported 17% C2 yield over Sr/La2O3
at 800 °C in a continuous-flow packed-bed reactor.

Although not as active and selective as Sr/La2O3, the catalytic per-
formance of CaO doped La2O3 has been investigated. Becker and
Baerns [74] reported 76% C2+ selectivity and 9% C2+ yield at 740 °C,
with the optimum La2O3/CaO ratio being in the range of 60–80%.
Stansch et al. [69] studied the kinetics of La2O3/CaO in a packed-
bed reactor and developed a ten-step reaction mechanism among
eight gas-phase species. The reaction mechanism was validated using
measurements in packed-bed reactors. A 2010 study by Rane et al.
[75] showed that the catalyst preparation method (i.e., physical
mixing of La2O3 and CaO or co-precipitation method) and source
of precursors (i.e., acetates, carbonates, nitrates, and hydroxides)
strongly influence the catalytic activity. Rane et al. demonstrated
15.2% C2 yield at 800 °C in a packed-bed reactor using catalysts
prepared by co-precipitation with carbonates as precursors.

66

C. Karakaya, R.J. Kee / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 60–97

Unfortunately, the La2O3/CaO shows low stability and activity in OCM
processes. Nevertheless, the synthesis is relatively straightfor-
ward and the catalytic activity can be controlled by the ratio between
La2O3 and CaO. In part, because validated reaction mechanisms are
available, a number of groups use La2O3/CaO as a basis for model-
based reactor development and parameter studies [76–81].

Unlike the Li/MgO and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2, the La2O3 catalysts
produce significant yields of C2H6. The doping metal and the support
structure can significantly affect the C2H4 to C2H6 ratio. Operating
at 730 °C, Baidya et al. [82] reported a C2H4/C2H6 ratio of 0.4, with
the overall C2+ yield at approximately 16%. Baidya et al. found that
by changing the support to Al2O3, the C2+ yield can be varied. By
tuning the Sr/Al ratio in the catalyst mixture, they were able to in-
crease the C2H4/C2H6 ratio to 1.7, with 18% overall C2+ yield at 810 °C.
The catalyst was durable for 48 h on stream, showing stable methane
conversion and C2+ selectivity.

Stability is a major concern with La2O3 catalysts, especially when
CO2 is present at temperatures above 650 °C. Under these condi-
tions, La2O3 reacts to form a dioxymonocarbonate structure [83,84],

which is unstable at high temperature (850–900 °C) [84].

2.4. Fe2O3 catalyst

Another potentially viable OCM catalyst group is based on iron
oxides [85,86]. Although methane conversion can be as high as 55–
60% at temperatures above 700 °C and the catalyst is stable, the C2
yield is below 5% [86]. The low C2 yield is caused by complete ox-
idation of methane at high temperatures. Iron forms the active
α-Fe2O3 phase and the oxygen in the lattice promotes the com-
plete oxidation of methane. Van Der Vaart [87] patented a process
using a 100–150 μm layer of Fe2O3 catalyst supported on a low-
surface-area non-porous 150–215 μm layer of SiO2. By mixing steam
into the CH4/O2 mixture, the C2 selectivity was increased with yields
up to 7% at 850 °C in a fluidized bed reactor. Van Der Vaart pro-
posed that water preferentially poisoned the catalyst surface by
occupying the catalytic sites that would otherwise serve to oxidize
the methyl radicals prior to the desired desorption. Although Fe-
containing catalysts may not be sufficiently selective for OCM, they
may be promising catalysts under non-oxidative conditions [88,89].

2.5. Low temperature catalysts

The inherent nature of methane activation generally requires
high-temperature processes. Thermal management, including tem-
perature uniformity, catalyst deactivation, and coke formation,
presents potential problems in the design and operation of high-
temperature reactors. Thus, there is ongoing interest in finding OCM
catalysts that are effective at relatively low operating temperatures.
Early catalyst screening studies focused on decreasing reaction
temperatures by considering different metals and metal oxides. Using
alkali- and alkaline-doped metal oxides, Roos et al. [90] showed that
reaction temperatures could be decreased to around 530 °C with
approximately 12% C2+ yield over a Li/MgO catalyst (5.3 wt.% Li) in
a packed-bed reactor. Alternatively, Fe—P—O catalysts, which belong
to the transition-metal group, also showed promising low-
temperature activity [91,92]. Using mass spectrometry and gas
chromatography, Annapragada and Gulari reported approximate-
ly 6.5% C2+ yield at 575 °C over a Fe—O—P catalyst in U-shaped and
straight packed-bed reactors [91].

A number of recent studies have shown that the catalyst activ-
ity depends not only on the catalyst’s metal composition, but also
on particle size and morphology [93–96]. Nano-structured cata-
lysts were found to activate the methane at lower temperatures

[96,97]. The superior catalytic activity of nanorods and nonofibers
was attributed to high surface areas, well defined crystalline struc-
tures, and their ability to form surface oxide species [93].

Noon et al. [97] showed that La2O3—CeO2 nanofibers delivered
superior OCM performance compared to the same catalysts in
powder form. Earlier studies by Dedov et al. [98] measured cata-
lytic activity of La2O3—CeO2 in powder form and they reported
optimum reaction temperatures in the range of 715–830 °C. The
Noon et al. study also showed that the methane activation tem-
peratures can be as low as 470 °C using the same catalyst
composition as the earlier findings of Dedov et al. Noon et al. re-
ported a maximum of 18% C2+ yield at 520 °C [97] in a packed-bed
reactor.

Hou et al. [95] studied La2O2CO3 catalysts with different na-
noscale plate and rod morphologies, particle sizes, and calcination
temperatures. Catalytic performance was measured in a packed-
bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The process delivered 30% CH4
conversion and 50% C2+ selectivity at 420 °C. The catalyst was fond
to be stable for over 50 h on stream.

Huang et al. [93] studied shape effects for nano-structured La2O3
catalysts under OCM conditions. The catalytic performance was mea-
sured in a packed-bed reactor where the catalyst was diluted with
the quartz sand. They reported that La2O3 nanorods were more active
than nano-particles. Approximately 10% C2 yield was reported at
450 °C, with reaction being initiated at 400 °C. However, elevated-
temperature stability was a problem with the La2O3—CeO2 material.
Above 550 °C, the C2 selectivity decreased greatly. A recent study
by Song et al. [94] developed a stable Sr/La2O3 nano-fiber catalyst.
They reported approximately 16% C2 yield at 500 °C, with the cat-
alyst being stable up to 800 °C.

Siluria Technologies filed patent applications for a series of
nanowire catalysts that operate at reaction temperatures below
600 °C [99]. One group of the nanowire lanthanum oxide catalysts
were composed of Ln14−xLn22−xO6, where Ln1 and Ln2 are two dif-
ferent lantanide-group metals (i.e., Y—La, Zr—La, Pr—La and Ce—La).
The C2+ yield was reported to exceed 22.5%. Another catalyst com-
position recently patented by Siluria Technologies was a nanowire
catalyst composed of 20 wt.% Mg, 5 wt.% Na, and 75 wt.% La2O3. The
reported C2+ yield was approximately 12% at 600 °C [100]. Using these
catalysts, Siluria Technologies has apparently commercialized an eth-
ylene production process. Although the reported single-pass C2+
yields do not meet the nominal target of 25%, the process temper-
ature is below 600 °C and the catalyst is durable over a long operating
periods. The low reaction temperature reduces overall heating costs
and decreases catalyst-deactivation rates. The up-scaled reactor was
composed of multiple OCM packed-bed reactors. Thermal man-
agement systems were designed to achieve either adiabatic or
isothermal conditions.

Fina Technology Inc. patented a composition using MgO as a
second support for the Sr/La catalyst on a low-temperature process
(T = 500 °C) [101]. Although the C2 yield was relatively low at ap-
proximately 10%, the low reaction temperature offered other
potential benefits. At low temperature, deactivation from sinter-
ing is greatly diminished.

2.6. OCM reaction kinetics

Although OCM is generally understood to be a catalytic process,
it does depend on homogeneous chemistry as well. Especially above
600 °C the homogenous chemistry can produce ethylene and ethane
without a catalyst. The relative importance of gas-phase chemis-
try depends on residence time and pressure, as well as the CH4/O2
ratio in the feed stream [102–104].

Experimental studies show that C2 formation rates depend
strongly on gas-phase methyl-radical concentrations [43,68,
Increasing the temperature and pressure
72,73,105–107].

increases the formation rate of methyl radicals almost indepen-
dently of the catalyst. However, in low-pressure regimes, the methyl-
radical formation rate depends weakly on temperature, but varies
significantly depending on the particular catalyst. Because the cat-
alyst increases the methyl-radical formation rate, the C2 formation
rate also increases.

Despite differences in the active catalytic sites on particular cata-
lysts, there is general consensus that at high temperature the
methane needs to be activated to form CH3 radicals, with the CH3
formation step being the rate determining step. The activation may
be via C—H bond breaking,

A study by Takanabe and Iglesia [108] proposed an alternative
reaction pathway for methane activation. In addition to the thermal
cracking and surface oxygen attacks, Takanabe and Igleisa’s study
suggested that the reaction product H2O has a promotional effect
on methane conversion and C2+ yield. Their study introduced an ad-
ditional CH3 formation pathway via OH radicals. According to reaction
steps (8) and (9), OH radicals are generated either via surface-
adsorbed oxygen O(s) or in the gas-phase via O2 and H2O reactions.

Between these reactions it is more likely that Reaction (8) is the
dominant pathway to form OH radicals. H2O is a very stable mol-
ecule and O—H bonds in H2O (497 kJ mol−1) are stronger than C—H
bond in CH4 (439 kJ mol−1). The OH can react with CH4 in the gas
phase to form CH3 radicals as

Takanabe and Iglesia [108] conducted a series of OCM experi-
ments in a recirculating batch reactor to support the proposed
reactions. They studied the effects of contact time and H2O addi-
tion or removal on CH4 conversion and C2+ yield. Their results showed
that adding approximately 4% H2O into the CH4/O2 mixtures at 800 °C
significantly improved the CH4 conversion and C2+ yield. However,
when H2 was removed the CH4 conversion was significantly
suppressed.

Lunsford and colleagues studied OCM reaction kinetics for a wide
range of catalysts, including Li/MgO, Sr/CaO, Sr/La2O3, Mn/Na2WO4/
SiO2 and Mn/Na2WO4/MgO [68,72,105,106,109]. Using matrix
isolation electron spin resonance (MIESR), they identified active sites
as well as methyl-radical formation pathways. The results showed
that C2H6 is formed in the gas phase via CH3-radical recombina-
tion as

where M represents a gas-phase third body. Further C2H6 dehydro-
genation produces C2H4 (cf., Fig. 2). The surface oxygen further
increases the ethyl radical (C2H5) formation rate. Lundsford argued
that CO is formed via a gas-phase reaction, whereas H2O and CO2
are formed on the surface and then desorb [109]. Sun et al. [110]
proposed that the CO, CO2, and H2O are formed both via homoge-
nous and heterogeneous pathways. Consistent with these studies,
Fig. 2 illustrates methane activation and formation of CO, CO2, and
H2O via both homogeneous and heterogeneous pathways.

ing both homogenous and heterogeneous reaction pathways. The

Although Reactions (13) and (14) involve only gas-phase species,
they are understood to be surface reactions. Homogeneous recom-
bination of CH3 radicals produces gas-phase C2H6 according to Eq.
(11).

In addition to the reaction pathways, individual reaction rates
need to be established. There is literature that reports global and
partially elementary OCM reaction mechanisms for several differ-
ent catalysts. Global representations of the OCM catalytic kinetics
use reactions that involve only gas-phase species (e.g., Table 1). The
rate expressions are empirical, with details of the catalysts (e.g., spe-
cific surface area, bed porosity and tortuosity, etc.) subsumed
implicitly into the rate expressions. The reaction pathways and func-
tional forms of the rate expressions are presumed to be general.
However, because the rate expressions are fit to particular experi-
ments, and for specific temperature and pressure ranges, the
kinetic parameters need to be fine-tuned before applying in other

circumstances. Nevertheless, with appropriate tuning for particu-
lar catalysts and operating conditions, the mechanisms can be used
to predict reactor behavior and assist reactor design. Because the
gas-phase thermodynamic properties are well established, the global
kinetics can predict exothermic behavior and hence temperature
variations within reactor catalyst beds.

As an alternative to global mechanisms, there are potential ben-
efits to developing elementary-step reaction mechanisms. Because
the elementary-step mechanisms involve surface adsorbates, es-
tablishing the thermodynamics, and hence microscopic reversibility,
is difficult. Although there is very little literature on elementary-
step OCM catalysis, there are certainly benefits to such development.
Because they are based on fundamentals, validated elementary-
step mechanisms have better predictive capability than do global
reaction mechanisms with empirical rate expressions.

Although OCM catalysts based on Li/MgO have relatively simple
atomic structure and are the easiest to understand, elementary
reaction mechanisms have yet to be fully developed. Practical
catalysts such as Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 structures are far more complex.
In addition to establishing reaction-pathway details, surface ther-
modynamics need to be established such that thermal balances can
be accurately represented. Synergistic combinations of theory and
experiment are needed to develop and validate general-purpose re-
action mechanisms.

anism with gas-phase and surface reactions. The nominal values
of the pre-exponential factors were derived from collision theory.
The activation barriers were estimated according to the Bell–Evans–
Polanyi relationship. The rate parameters were fine-tuned based
on packed-bed reactor experiments, where the effects of temper-
ature, feed composition (fuel/oxygen) and gas-hourly space velocity
were investigated. An isothermal, one-dimensional, packed-bed
reactor model was developed to assist interpreting the measure-
ments and assigning rate parameters. The surface reactions were
represented as 11 irreversible steps. The surface adsorbates that
were considered are O(s), OH(s), CO(s), CHO(s), CH2O(s) and CH3O(s).
The reaction mechanism considers gas-phase adsorption on the
catalytic active sites, adsorbate–adsorbate reactions, and the reac-
tion of gas-phase radicals with surface adsorbates. The detailed
gas-phase reactions were represented with 39 reversible steps
among 13 species. This reaction mechanism was adapted from
the earlier studies of Marin and colleagues [117,118]. The product
gas-phase species included CO, CO2, H2, H2O, C2H4, and C2H6,C3H6
and C3H8.

Sun et al. [110] proposed a detailed OCM reaction mechanism
to represent gas-phase and surface reactions over Li/MgO and Sn/
Li/MgO catalysts. This mechanism consists of 14 surface reactions
and 39 gas-phase reactions. As with the Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 cata-
lysts, the methane activation proceeds via methyl-radical formation
in the gas-phase as well as on the catalyst surface. Methyl radicals
recombine to form C2H6. The desired gas-phase products are C2H4
and C2H6, with the undesired oxidation products being CO, CO2, and
H2O. The surface species include O(s), OH(s), H2O(s), CH3O(s), CH2O(s),
CHO(s), CO(s), CO2(s). The reaction mechanism includes the ad-
sorption of gas-phase species, reaction of gas-phase species (either
radical or stable molecules) with surface adsorbates (Eley–Rideal

steps), or the surface–surface reactions. The model is validated under
isothermal reactor conditions.

To date, there are no published reaction mechanisms for the low-
temperature OCM catalysts (i.e., T < 700 °C). However, there is general
agreement that the methane activation on La2O3 catalysts relies on
CH3-radical formation mechanisms. The high-temperature reac-
tion pathway is thought to be different from the low-temperature
pathways. Although the surface can create sufficient methyl radi-
cals, the CH3 recombination and C2H6 dehydrogenation steps must
occur in gas-phase. Thus, even for low-temperature processes, it
should be expected that the temperature plays an important role.

3. Non-oxidative conversion of methane

There are two broad approaches to achieve the non-oxidative con-
version of methane. Both are catalytic dehydrogenation processes,
but seek different products. The first seeks to produce primarily eth-
ylene and ethane, which are valuable feedstock for further
downstream processing. The second, which is usually called methane
dehyroaromatization (MDA), seeks to produce benzene. In princi-
ple, both approaches are feasible at high temperatures with
sufficiently selective catalysts.

3.1. Methane to ethylene and ethane

The desired production of C2H4 from CH4 can be represented glob-
ally as in Eq. (2) and the C2H6 formation from methane can be

Unlike OCM, where some H2 is converted to H2O, the non-
oxidative conversion retains H2 as reaction product. Because the
chemistry does not involve oxygen or oxygen-containing species,
it is theoretically possible to increase the carbon selectivity toward
C2H4 and C2H6. However, even assuming a perfect catalyst, Fig. 3
shows that equilibrium direct conversion of C2H4 or C2H6 is ther-
modynamically limited and only favored at high temperatures. Fig. 3
also shows that graphitic carbon (C) is much more favorable than
the reactions to form C2 and benzene. At 500 °C, the equilibrium con-
versions of CH4 to C2H6 and C2H4 are only about 0.6% and 1%,
respectively. The direct conversion of CH4 to C2 is practical only above
about 800 °C, with the C2H4 being significantly greater than C2H6.
Although the formation of both C2H4 and C2H6 occur via methane
dehydrogenation pathways, Fig. 4 shows the nature of these two re-
actions to be quite different. Based on the Gibbs free energy change
associated with the global reactions, direct C2H4 formation (i.e.,
) is favorable only at high temperatures. The

direct C2H6 formation (i.e., 2
) is always signifi-
4
cantly endothermic, with very little temperature dependence. Even
at a high temperature of 900 °C the direct conversion of CH4 to C2H6
is only around 4.8%. This suggests that C2 formation may not be direct
at practical reactor temperatures.

The practical conversion of CH4 to C2 may be feasible at mod-
erate temperatures via indirect routes. According to Fig. 4, the direct
conversion of methane to carbon (i.e., CH
) is exother-
mic at temperatures above about 500 °C. Thus, the methane could
be first converted to graphitic carbon, subsequently reacting with
H2 to form either C2H4, C2H6, or CH4. Such a two-step process is called
a methane-homologation process [119–125]. Fig. 4 shows that the
indirect C2H6 formation ( 2
) is exothermic below about
200 °C. However, the reaction must compete with methanation
4(cid:2) ), which is more exothermic at low temperatures.

thermodynamically limited. Fig. 3 shows that even at 700 °C, the
equilibrium thermodynamics limits the methane conversion to
below 10% for either ethylene or benzene; the dominant reaction
produces carbon. Fig. 3 shows that the benzene formation is
more favorable than ethylene. Although not shown in Fig. 3, higher
aromatic compounds such as naphthalene (C10H8) are thermody-
namically more favorable than benzene. Moreover, a wide range
of usually undesired aromatic side compounds (e.g., indene,
anthracene and higher polyaromatic hydrocarbons) are inevitably
produced.

4. Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA)

The MDA process was first discovered in 1993 by Wang et al.
[126]. The most relevant catalysts are metal-loaded (e.g., Mo, W, Cu,
Re, V, Ga) bi-functional zeolites [127–130]. Methane is first acti-
vated on the metal sites to form small C2 species (typically ethylene)
and H2. Aromatization then follows at zeolite acid sites. Among the
metal possibilities, Mo is the most active for methane conversion.
Benzene selectivity depends on the zeolite cage dimensions, and
hence on the zeolite type. Depending on the particular zeolite, the
cage dimensions typically range between 0.35 and 0.85 nm. Zeo-
lites with small cage dimensions, close to the atomic diameter of
benzene, are most selective for benzene formation [131,132]. The
particular zeolites that are most effective for benzene production
include HZSM-5 [133–140], HMCM-22 [141–144], HMCM-36 [145],
and HMCM-49 [146,147].

Fig. 5 is a three-dimensional representation of the atomic po-
sitions within a HZSM-5 zeolite crystal. The hydrogen atoms on the
periphery of the large zeolite cage form the Brønsted-acid sites. Cata-
lytic performance and selectivity depend on the cage dimension
relative to the characteristic dimensions of reactant or product
molecules.

The Mo/zeolite catalysts can be fabricated using alternative prep-
aration methods. In most cases, a wet impregnation is followed by
calcination. That is, a Mo precursor (e.g., ammonium molybdate)
is first introduced into zeolite powders. Upon calcination, the Mo
precursor forms an oxide, MoOx. Another approach is to physically
mix MoOx and zeolite powders. In either case, the catalyst is ini-
tially in the form of a MoOx/zeolite mixture. However, the MoOx is
not stable in reducing environments. In MDA processes, the MoOx
is transformed to a molybdenum–carbide structure.

Even if direct or indirect C2 formation is possible, equilibrium
thermodynamics severely limits conversion and yield (cf., Fig. 3).
Even at the 800 °C, equilibrium methane conversion to C2 reaches
only about 8.5%. Thus, as discussed subsequently, hydrogen-
permeable membranes offer the possibility to significantly increase
the CH4 conversion.

3.2. Methane to ethylene and aromatics

Under non-oxidative conditions ethylene formation is usually fol-
lowed by the further growth of aromatics. With a selective catalyst,
potentially valuable aromatic yields (e.g., benzene) can be further
increased. The overall methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) process
can be represented globally as shown by Reaction (1). Of course,
such a simplified global representation provides very little insight
into the complexities of the process.

As is typical of dehydrogenation processes, the direct
conversion of methane to both ethylene and aromatics is

aluminum ratio of 95. The primary cage is at the upper left of the image. The Brønsted-
acid sites are formed by the atomic hydrogens on the periphery of the zeolite cage.

4.1. Catalyst and active sites

Although it is generally established that CH4 is first activated on
Mo2C sites, their specific configuration, oxidation state, interac-
tions with zeolite Brønsted acid sites, and dimerization kinetics are
not yet fully understood. It is well accepted that the molybdenum
undergoes transformation from molybdenum oxide to a complex
carbide when it is exposed to methane. Beginning with freshly syn-
thesized Mo/zeolite catalysts the Mo is initially in the Mo6+ state.
Exposing calcined Mo/HZSM-5 to CH4 at 700 °C causes the reduc-
tion of 60–80% of the Mo6+ to a molybdenum–carbide structure.
During the carburization process the molybdenum incorporation
is associated with the Brønsted acid sites. Thus, as molybdenum is
incorporated, the Brønsted acid sites are replaced by molycarbide
structures.

The transition between the oxide and carbide phases can be rep-

resented notionally as [148,149]

The carburization process may be accomplished in-situ within
an MDA reactor or it may be prepared beforehand. When the car-
burization is accomplished in-situ, the MDA process starts with an
induction period that may require several hours. During this tran-
sient process the Mo2C concentration increases, which also serves
to increase the benzene formation rate. During the induction period,
the reaction of methane with MoOx forms CO, CO2 and H2O as prod-
ucts. The carburization time depends on the gas-hourly space velocity
and temperature. Under typical MDA reaction conditions (700–
800 °C and 750–4500 ml gcat−1 h−1) the process is typically completed
in 1–2 hours. In the context of MDA, “completing” the carburiza-
tion process means that a quasi-steady state is reached in terms of
methane conversion and benzene yield. However, not all the mo-
lybdenum oxide phases are transformed to the molybdenum carbide,
with some MoO3, MoOxC and Mo2C co-existing.

The distribution between the MoO3, MoOxC and Mo2C depends
strongly on the zeolite Si/Al ratios. At low Si/Al ratios the MoOx phase
is stabilized inside the zeolite structure whereas at high Si/Al ratios
(typically in the range of 25–140), the MoOx is stabilized outside
of the zeolite cages [150]. The surface MoO3 is easily converted to
Mo2C in a reducing atmosphere (i.e., during carburization). However,
the MoOx that is stabilized within the zeolite cages is less accessi-
ble by virtue of mass-transport limitations within small cage
channels. Thus, the interior molybdenum-oxides are more diffi-
cult to reduce and can remain partially oxidized under MDA reaction
conditions [149].

The relative catalytic activities of alternative molybdenum struc-
tures for methane activation are not yet established. A number of
studies show that Mo2C is the active center for methane activa-
tion [135,151–154]. Experimental studies also indicate that
molyoxides coexist with the carbides, but their catalytic role is
debated [151,155–157].

Although the notation Mo2C is compact and widely used, the
chemical structures of molycarbides are considerably more complex.
The exact carbide structure, possibly including oxycarbides (MoOxC),
remains uncertain, and likely depends on the particular zeolite and
the processing conditions. The Mo within the zeolite framework is
found to be in the form of a dimer Mo O2
, associating with two
5

Brønsted acid sites [151,158,159]. Monomeric bidendate MoO2
with a single Mo atom is anchored into the cage structure through
oxygen bridges [142]. According to DFT simulations [160,161], the
particular Mo structure in monomer or dimer form within the zeolite
framework is determined by the zeolite Si/Al ratios. A DFT study
by Zhou et al. [162] identified three alternative molycarbide struc-
tures with different coordination at the zeolite acid sites. For low
Si/Al ratios, the linearly bonded Mo is either in Mo5+ or Mo6+ states

It is generally established that the Mo structure and its cata-
lytic activity depend on the synthesis method and the molybdenum
loading [158,159,163]. The Mo content in the zeolite can vary
between 1 wt.% and 20 wt.% [149,155,164–166], with the optimum
Mo loading depending on the preparation method, carburization
temperature, and reaction conditions [137,151,158,159,164]. Typi-
cally, Mo loading in the range of 4–6 wt.% delivers best MDA
performance.

Lu et al. [166] studied Mo loading effects on HZSM-5 zeolites.
The catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation and the Mo
loading was varied between 1 and 10 wt.%. They identified three
different molybdenum structures: molybdenum carbide (Mo2C),
molybdenum-oxide carbide (MoOxC), and molybdenum oxide
(MoO3). The best Mo loadings were found to be between 4 and
6 wt.%. Increasing the Mo content further did not increase the
benzene selectivity.

Li et al. [165] prepared a 6 wt.% Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. They iden-
[
tified Mo O5
in the zeolite channel, which is incorporated into
the zeolite structure by the replacement of an acid site that is co-
ordinated through Al. They also reported that α-MoO3 and
amorphous MoO3 are distributed on exterior zeolite surfaces. Fur-
thermore, at very high Mo loadings entrance to the zeolite cages
could be blocked by Mo particles.

Chen et al. [155] studied the effects of Mo loadings between 1
and 20 wt.% on HZSM-5 catalysts in a packed-bed reactor. By mea-
suring the methane conversion and aromatic yield, they showed that
increasing Mo content above 10 wt.% decreased the aromatic yield.
The best Mo loading was found to be between 2 and 3 wt.%. The
study suggested that both the molybdenum sites and zeolite acid
sites were active for methane aromatization. Although Mo2C struc-
tures were formed within zeolite channels, it was suggested that
small crystallites of MoO3 were the active sites for methane
dimerization.

Using density functional theory (DFT), Fadeeva et al. [149] studied
alternative molybdenum structures in HZSM-5 zeolites. At high Mo
loadings, (e.g., 15 wt.%) Al was predicted to be extracted from the
zeolite framework to form Al MoO

4.2. Catalyst deactivation

In addition to thermodynamic limitations, rapid or gradual cat-
alyst deactivation represents a significant practical challenge. Even
with highly selective catalysts, undesired hydrocarbon products (e.g.,
C10H8, C10+) are formed, thus limiting the C6H6 and C2H4 yield. Fur-
thermore, condensed carbon or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which
are thermodynamically the most stable products of the direct de-
hydrogenation process, cause severe catalyst deactivation during the
MDA process [38,167]. Broadly speaking, catalyst-deactivating carbon
can take the form of solid carbon (coke) and polyaromatic hydro-
carbons (PAH) [168,169].

Ichikawa and co-workers studied deposit formation in isother-
mal packed-bed reactors with Mo/zeolite catalysts [168,170,171].
After measuring activity as a function of time-on-stream they char-
acterized the deposits using ex-situ temperature programmed
oxidation (TPO). At low temperatures the deposits were found to
be in the form of graphitic carbon on, or near to, the Mo2C. The high
temperature deposits were in the form of PAH within, or near the
entrance of, the zeolite channels. The PAHs diminish the methane
aromatization chemistry because they block access to the zeolite
channels. As discussed subsequently, the surface deposits can be
removed by reaction with oxygenated species. The PAH deposits,
especially those within zeolite channels, are more difficult to remove
because of transport limitations within the channels. These PAHs
are suggested to be the major hydrocarbons that are responsible for
catalyst fouling [172,173].

Zhang and co-workers [174,175] published studies investigat-
ing deposit formation pathways and chemical composition on
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts at 800 °C. They used thermogravimetric anal-
ysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and TPO
techniques to characterize the catalyst-deactivating deposits and
identify deposit-forming pathways. Fig. 7 graphically summarizes
alternative carbon-deposit pathways. Graphitic coke was attrib-
uted to CH4 dehydrogenation or C2H4 cracking. The PAH deposits
were the result of molecular-weight growth and condensation.

By dividing the reactor into three zones, the Zhang group was
able to identify different deposit characteristics along the length of
a packed-bed reactor. The deposit types along a packed-bed reactor
were non-uniform and depended greatly on the local hydrogen con-
centration. In the upstream regions, graphite-like coke was dominant
and it was mainly formed by dehydrogenation of CH4. In the second
and third zones (downstream), the main carbon-formation path was
via C2H4 cracking on the zeolite. The PAHs were formed primarily
in the third zone of the reactor. The study showed that the overall
dominant deposit-formation pathway was via C2H4 cracking.

4.3. Catalyst regeneration

Because catalyst deactivation is practically inevitable under MDA
reaction conditions, some catalyst regeneration strategy is neces-
sary. In-situ catalyst regeneration can be accomplished by switching
the feed-stream gas to an oxidant such as O2 or NO [170] or a re-
ducing gas such as H2 [177–182]. Ex-situ regeneration is also possible,
but often less desirable because the reactors must be shut down
and the catalysts removed.

Oxygen is an effective regeneration gas in the sense that the
carbon deposits can be removed via oxidation to gas-phase species.
However, oxygen regeneration is often accompanied by other del-
eterious processes. The O2 not only removes the deposited carbon,
but can also oxidize the active Mo2C to inactive or less active MoOx.
The molybdenum carburization process is reversible, but a non-
productive induction period is required. Additionally, the exothermic
carbon oxidation could cause catalyst degradation associated with
temperature excursions and local hot spots. Nitric oxide reacts more
aggressively with carbon deposits than does oxygen. Thus, alter-
native oxidants, such as NO or O2—NO mixtures, can reduce the
oxidation temperatures in the range 330

≤ ≤
T

450

°
C .

Regeneration based on periodic switching of feed gases is in-
herently inefficient because of non-productive reactor time. Thus,
there are benefits associated with alternative operating condi-
tions that can extend the interval between regeneration cycles.
Introducing very low levels of oxidizers (e.g., O2, NO, CO, CO2, H2O)
with the methane feed gas can be effective [183,184]. Although hy-
drogen is a product of dehydrogenation, mixing low levels of H2 with
the methane feed can also have beneficial effects on long-time cat-
alyst stability [156,171].

It is interesting to note that in-situ catalyst-regeneration ap-
proaches, such as co-feeding of CO, CO2, H2O and H2, are patented
technologies. As recently as 2015, Shell Oil patented an MDA ap-
plication where mixtures of CO, CO2, and H2 are premixed with the
methane feed to improve the catalyst stability [185]. Exxon Mobil
also patented an MDA application where different levels of CO, CO2,
H2O, and H2 are co-fed in a fluidized-bed reactor [186–188]. Im-
proved catalytic stability was one of the claims.

4.3.1. Co-feeding O2, CO and CO2

Tan et al. [156] studied the effects of co-feeding O2, CO2, and H2
on MDA performance in a packed-bed reactor at 770 °C over a 2 wt.%
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. The results showed that premixing up to 5.3%
O2 and 12.8% CO2 reduced the catalyst deactivation rate. The cata-
lyst was stable up to 6 h, producing 4% aromatic yield at 770 °C.
However, after the first 6 h, the catalyst deactivated rapidly over the
next 4 h and the process no longer produced aromatic species. Based
on XPS analysis, the deactivation was attributed to excess O2 or CO2
that promoted a phase change of molybdenum carbide to less-
active molybdenum oxide.

Although high levels of CO2 are detrimental, low levels can
play beneficial roles. Camacho Rodrigues and Fontes Monteiro
[189] studied the effect of co-feeding CO2 in a packed-bed reactor
over a Mo/HMCM-22 catalyst. The CO2 feed concentration varied
between 5.7 and 6.7%. They measured the gas-phase H2, CH4,
C2H4, C2H6, benzene, toluene and naphthalene as functions of
time-on-stream using online gas chromatography coupled with
thermal conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization detectors (FID).
The results showed that CO2 beneficially extended the catalyst
lifetime. Apparently, the CO2 reacts with surface carbon [C], clean-
ing the catalyst surface (s), and producing CO. It is likely that the
CO2 reacts with any deposited coke according to the Bouduard
process as

Yao et al. [147] studied the promotional role of CO in MDA over
a Mo/HMCM-49 catalyst. Using isotopically labeled carbon in CO
as 13C, they showed that CO participates in oxidizing the carbona-
ceous surface species. By measuring the isotopically tagged benzene
13CxC6−xH6 (x = 0–3) as a function of time-on-stream, the results re-
vealed complexities associated with the influence of CO in MDA.
In addition to reaction with surface-adsorbed carbon, CO also par-
ticipates in the benzene formation. The added CO did not affect the
methane conversion, but improved the catalyst stability. This result
is consistent with the earlier studies of Liu et al. [190] that also used
isotopically labeled CO. A subsequent study by Liu et al. [176] ex-
plained the beneficial role of CO by the reaction of surface-deposited
carbon [C] with the surface oxygen O(s) as in Eq. (19). Liu et al. [176]
also reported that co-feeding CO increases the benzene and naph-
thalene formation rates, increases methane conversion, and extends
the catalyst lifetime.

Liu et al. [190] also studied the effects of co-feeding CO2 (10%
or higher) in MDA over a Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. Perhaps surpris-
ingly, the process was reported to be more sensitive to CO2 in the
feed than it was to CO in the feed. Co-feeding only 1.6% CO2 de-
creased the benzene formation rate, but increased the methane
conversion. Increasing the feed CO2 concentration above 10% greatly
suppressed the aromatic yield. Apparently, the CO2 participated in
methane dry reforming as

With high CO2 levels, the reforming reaction path was thermo-

dynamically favored over the desired MDA path.

4.3.2. H2O co-feeding

Co-feeding H2O in the MDA reactive gas mixture is experimen-
tally demonstrated to improve the catalyst stability and several
research groups have explored the behavior [190–197]. The bene-
ficial role of steam is generally explained by the removal of surface
carbon [C] by H2O to form CO and H2, via either the change in zeolite
acid site density or by the steam reforming of naphthalene.

Ichikawa and co-workers published a series of papers studying
the beneficial role of steam in MDA [171,190,191]. According to their
studies, the H2O can play several, possibly competitive, roles. Steam
may promote methane reforming, react with surface carbon, or
modify the Mo2C structure. Ma et al. [171] studied the co-feeding
effects of H2 and/or H2O in MDA over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts at 750 °C
and 3 bar. They reported the principal methane reactions and their
Gibbs free energies (evaluated at 750 °C and 3 bar) as

Based on the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG = −33 kJ), the steam-
reforming path was expected to dominate. Adding less than 1.8%
H2O was beneficial in suppressing catalyst deactivation. However,
increasing the H2O concentration also caused rapid catalyst

deactivation, which is likely associated with Mo2C oxidation and
dealumination of the zeolite. This study also reported synergistic
effects of co-feeding H2 and H2O. The H2 inhibited the degradation
of the Mo2C complex which can be oxidized by reaction with H2O
[198]. Using low-level H2O co-feed, Ma et al. [171] reported durable
catalyst performance in a packed-bed reactor for over 1000 minutes
time-on-stream. Improved MDA stability was explained by the
suppression of PAH at the zeolite acid sites. Fig. 8 reproduces
the Ma et al. [171] benzene formation rates, with different co-feed
streams.

Yao et al. [192] also studied the effect of premixing H2O in the
MDA feed over a Mo/HMCM-49 catalyst in a packed-bed reactor.
By introducing 2.9% H2O into the 87.4% CH4 and 9.7% N2 feed stream,
they claimed to synergistically combine methane steam reform-
ing and MDA chemistry. Stable catalyst performance was reported
for up to 60 h time-on-stream. These results were explained by the
beneficial participation of H2O in reforming chemistry, producing
CO and H2. The CO, which is a product of Eq. (25), can further react
with the surface deposited carbon [C] according to Eqs. (17)–(19).
Liu et al. [193] studied MDA chemistry over a 3 wt.% Mo/
HZSM-5 catalyst at 730 °C. They reported that up to 2% H2O can
improve the catalyst activity and stability. According to their TPO,
XPS, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
measurements, the improvement of catalytic activity was related
to the removal of weakly bound surface carbon prior to its trans-
formation to the graphitic or aromatic carbon that causes catalyst
deactivation. They found molybdenum in the form of Mo2C and
Mo2OxCy after carburization. However, with greater than 2% H2O the
carbide structures reacted to form oxides, Mo2O—MoO3.

Skutil and Taniewski [194] studied the effects of premixing H2O,
CO, and CO2 in methane feed for an MDA process using Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts at 725 °C. They showed that up to 2% H2O and 2.5% CO2
increased the catalytic activity, benzene yield, and improved the cat-
alyst stability. However, further increases in H2O (9.5%) and CO2 (5
and 11%) caused rapid catalyst deactivation. Premixing 8.5% CO en-
hanced the catalytic activity and catalyst stability, but slightly
decreased the benzene selectivity.

Several groups studied the role of H2O in the context of chang-
ing the Brønsted-acid site density [139,195–197]. According to Ding
et al. [195] zeolite deactivation is caused by the PAH formation. The
Brønsted acid sites promote cyclization and aromatization. Any excess
of acid sites tends to promote further aromatization from benzene
to naphthalene and higher condensable PAHs. Steam reduces the
Brønsted acidity, leading to significant improvement in benzene se-
lectivity and catalyst stability.

4.3.3. Reaction of steam with naphthalene

Steam can play a significant role in cracking naphthalene, which
is the primary precursor leading to deleterious condensed PAHs.
Naphthalene is a gas-phase compound under the MDA reaction con-
ditions, but can react rapidly to form higher polyaromatics (e.g.,
anthracene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene), which con-
dense to form solid deposits on the catalyst. These species can block
zeolite cage openings, inhibiting transport into and out of the small
channels. The result appears as catalyst deactivation.

Low levels of H2O can react beneficially with naphthalene, in-
terrupting the pathway to higher PAH. The reaction products
(including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ethylene, benzene) also ben-
eficially affect the MDA process. Fig. 9 shows two possible reaction
pathways for subsequent reaction with naphthalene. Without an
oxidant in the reactive stream, molecular weight growth pro-
cesses pyrolyze naphthalene toward higher aromatics and PAH
deposits (left-hand pathway). However with low-level steam ad-
dition (right-hand pathway) naphthalene steam-cracking chemistry
can impede molecular weight growth and form small aromatics as
well as CO and H2 [199]. Moreover, as discussed previously, steam
can react with deposited carbon to assist surface regeneration. Thus,
low levels of steam are expected to reduce the catalyst deactiva-
tion rate.

Buchireddy et al. [200] studied naphthalene steam cracking in
a packed-bed reactor with a mixture of synthesis gas (20% CO, 9%
CO2, 20% H2, 3% CH4), C10H8, and H2O at 750 °C and a steam-to-
carbon ratio of 5. They proposed that cracking reactions take place
within the zeolite cage structure at Brønsted acid sites. Therefore,
higher acidity tends to increase naphthalene cracking activity.
Because naphthalene must be transported inside the zeolite cages,
the cage size strongly influences the cracking rate. Zeolites with larger
cages produce higher cracking activity. For example, H-ZSM5, which
has a characteristic cage dimension of 55 nm, delivered 19% naph-
thalene conversion. The ZY-30, which has a characteristic cage
dimension of 80 nm, increased the naphthalene conversion to 33%.
Buchireddy et al. suggested that the naphthalene cracking pro-
duces graphitic carbon C(s) as well as volatile CO, CO2, and smaller

and H2O (Eq. (25)) to form CO.

Incorporating Ni into zeolites can significantly increase the naph-
thalene conversion up to 98%. Buchireddy et al. [200] explained the
high conversion by the effect of Ni in promoting steam and dry
reforming as

Buchireddy et al. measured naphthalene conversion, but did not
report the product composition. Thus, the chemical pathways gov-
erning steam–naphthalene interaction remain unclear. Nevertheless,
based on thermodynamics considerations, steam reforming of naph-
thalene should be fast above 700 °C. The Gibbs free energy change
of the naphthalene–steam-reforming reaction (Eq. (27)) is ΔG = −66 kJ
at 750 °C.

Naphthalene steam cracking is certainly not limited to zeolite
catalysts. Devi et al. [199] studied naphthalene steam cracking over
olivine (Mg—Fe silicate) catalysts and proposed a detailed reac-
tion pathway, producing gas-phase benzene, toluene, ethylene,
indene and acetylene. The reaction mechanism also involved PAH
species, including fluoranthene, anthracene, phenantracene, crysene,
and pyrene. These higher PAH are also responsible for deactiva-
tion under MDA conditions [172,173]. Thus, it is at least possible
that similar molecular-weight-growth pathways are active on the
Mo/zeolite catalysts.

Wang et al. [201] proposed a reaction pathway for naphtha-
lene steam cracking over Rh2O3/HY zeolite and Mo—Ni oxide
catalysts. In this reaction pathway, naphthalene ring opening favors
the formation of smaller alkanes and aromatics. However hydro-
genation reactions proceed in parallel with steam cracking, producing
very large polyaromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., teralin and decalin)
through condensation reactions.

In addition to dominantly catalytic chemistry, gas-phase reac-
tions may also play important roles, especially at high temperature.
Jess [202] studied homogeneous gas-phase reaction of naphtha-
lene and steam at temperatures between 700 and 1400 °C. Although
naphthalene is difficult to activate homogeneously at tempera-
tures below 800 °C, at higher temperatures numerous gas-phase
products were measured (CO, CO2, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C6H6 and C7H8,
C9H8 and C9H10). These gas-phase species are also products of cata-
lytic naphthalene steam cracking processes [199,201]. Although gas-
phase chemistry may be active, the catalyst certainly affects reaction
pathways and the product distribution.

Although low-level steam addition surely has a beneficial influ-
ence for MDA processes, there is very limited fundamental
understanding of naphthalene–steam chemistry on zeolite-based
catalysts. Improved understanding the interaction of naphthalene–
steam reactions and the catalyst deactivation mechanisms will likely
contribute to improved MDA process technology. Synergistic the-
oretical and experimental research is certainly needed.

4.4. Incorporating a second metal into Mo/zeolite

Catalyst stability and performance can be varied by incorporat-
ing another metal in addition to Mo. Noble metals (i.e., Pt, Pd, Rh,
Ru, Ir, Re) [203–205], transition metals (i.e., Fe, Cr, Co, Ga, Ni, Zn,
Ti, W) [89,135,206–208] and their combinations [209,210] have been
evaluated for MDA applications. Among the noble metals, Pt- and
Re-doped Mo/zeolite catalysts showed increased catalytic activity
and stability.

Burns et al. [206] studied incorporating transition metals (Ga,
Co, Al, Fe) into Mo/Zeolite catalysts using an impregnation tech-
nique. Using a packed-bed reactor, measurements were reported




74

C. Karakaya, R.J. Kee / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 60–97

for methane conversion as well as hydrogen and benzene forma-
tion rates. Catalyst screening revealed that Ga, Fe, and Al can all help
to improve the catalyst stability. The second metal can change the
zeolite catalyst structure via reaction with aluminum to form a sec-
ondary metal-aluminum-oxide phase. The second metal also has
the effect of modifying the Brønsted acidity. Yet another potential
role of the secondary metal is to form mixed molybdenum-
containing phases. The second metal can also affect the initial
molybdenum-oxide dispersion.

Although only indirectly related to MDA, Yeh et al. [211] com-
pared Ga- and Pt-incorporated metal/ZSM-5 structures in
endothermic hexane reforming. The Ga was shown to enhance both
the aromatization rates and catalyst stability.

Aboul-Gheit et al. [208] studied bimetallic Mo—Fe, Mo—Co and
M—Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts (equal weights, 3% each) in a packed-bed
reactor at 700 °C. The metals were incorporated into the catalyst
by mechanical mixing. They measured the catalytic activity in terms
of methane conversion and aromatic yield as functions of time-
on-stream. Based on ex-situ TPO measurements they determined
the cumulative coke formation rate. Unlike Burns et al. [206], Aboul-
Gheit et al. [208] reported that second-metal incorporation increased
the coke and hydrogen formation rates, with the effects being great-
est for Fe, followed by Co and then Ni. Aboul-Gheit et al. interpreted
the low catalytic activity of Mo mixed with group-VIII metals (Fe,
Co, Ni) in terms of electronic structure and unfilled d-orbitals. The
mixed-metal structures influenced the chemisorption behavior,
strengthening the CH4 adsorption and leading to coke formation.
In addition to the second-metal identity, the loading also affects
the activity. However, there appear to be no general rules for de-
termining the optimal ratios between Mo and the second metal.
Masiero et al. [212] studied effects of the Mo/Fe ratio in HZSM-5
catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the cat-
alyst phases. The catalytic activity at 700 °C was reported in terms
of methane conversion and benzene selectivity. Catalyst deactivat-
ing deposits were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
differential thermal analysis (DTA), and temperature-programmed
oxidation (TPO). The study showed that increasing Fe content de-
creased the acid strength and hence decreased aromatization. A Mo/
Fe ratio of 4 increased the catalytic activity as well as the stability.
In addition to improved activity, the Fe formed a second bimetal-
lic Fe2(MoO4)3 structure that enhanced the catalytic stability.

A 2015 study by Abdelsayed et al. [89] confirmed that Fe incor-
poration increased methane conversion and catalyst stability. Unlike,
Masiero et al. [212], Abdelsayed et al. did not observe any second-
ary Mo phases. However, they found that carbon nanotubes were
formed on the spent catalysts. The carbon nano-structures appar-
ently enhanced reactant and product diffusion and coke resistance.

4.5. Alternative catalysts

Although zeolite catalysts with a range of cage sizes and metal
loadings are used, there may be viable alternatives with non-
zeolite catalysts. A 2014 discovery by Guo et al. [88] suggested that
Fe with SiO2 supports is an excellent catalyst for the non-oxidative
conversion of methane to ethylene. They reported a 30% C2H4 yield
at 950 °C in a packed-bed reactor. The process also yielded signif-
icant amounts of aromatics (approximately 23%), primarily benzene
and naphthalene. The catalyst showed excellent durability over
long periods up to 60 h, without the appearance of carbon
deposits. The reported process temperatures were very high

(i.e.,

1020 °C, Guo et al. reported methane conversion to be 32%, with
steady product selectivities of 52.7% ethylene, 21.5% benzene, and
25.8% naphthalene for 60 h on stream. Operating in the tempera-

almost constant. Although high operating temperature represents
a practical technological disadvantage, the performance of Fe/SiO2
catalysts for C2H4 or aromatics production merits further
investigation.

4.6. MDA reaction kinetics

There is relatively little literature on the detailed reaction path-
ways and associated rates for MDA kinetics on bi-functional Mo/
zeolite catalysts. It is reasonably well established that molybdenum–
carbide complex is the active center for methane activation. The Mo2C
is believed to be responsible for activating methane to form small
C2 olefins (mainly C2H4) and hydrogen. Describing the methane-
activation chemistry on the Mo2C probably requires fewer reaction
steps than does the subsequent chemistry on the zeolite acid sites.
Nevertheless, because of the relatively complex Mo2C structure (cf.,
Fig. 6), establishing the elementary reaction steps is challenging.
Iglesia and co-workers [18,213] proposed a global reaction for

with k being a rate constant, pi being partial pressures, and K being

As illustrated in Fig. 10, Xing et al. [161,162] were the first to
propose elementary reaction steps to form C2H4 on Mo2C struc-
tures. The cycle begins by methane adsorption, followed by a
transition state leading to hydrogen desorption. Methane is again
adsorbed, followed by hydrogen and ethylene desorption restor-
ing the catalyst to its original Mo2C structure.

Following the methane dimerization on the Mo2C, aromatiza-
tion takes place on the zeolite Brønsted acid sites. The aromatization
chemistry is complex, involving numerous reaction steps. As is typical
of Brønsted acid sites, chemistry proceeds according to chemisorp-
tion, desorption, hydride transfer, pyrolytic dehydrogenation/
hydrogenation, protolysis, oligomerization, and β-scission processes.
Iglesia and co-workers [18,213] proposed a three-step lumped
kinetics model for MDA on Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. Following the

Based on the gas-phase chemistry of methane pyrolysis as orig-
inally developed by Dean [214], the Iglesia studies also discuss the
effects of gas-phase reactions in MDA. Under the packed-bed con-
ditions studied, the gas-phase contributions were found to be
negligible [213].

As illustrated in Fig. 11, Wong et al. reported heterogeneous re-
action pathways for aromatization chemistry on HZSM-5 and HMCM-
22 zeolites [215]. The methane dimerization kinetics on molybdenum
was explained in a global step following the reaction pathway pro-
posed by Li et al. [213]. In the Wong et al. study, the formation of
ethylene is followed by aromatization on zeolites Brønsted acid sites.
Chemisorption, oligomerization, pyrolysis, hydride transfer and
alklylation are the major reaction paths leading to gas-phase prod-
ucts C2H4, C2H6, C6H6, C7H8 and C10H8. The reaction pathway also
includes gas-phase reaction intermediates (e.g., hexane, cyclohex-
+). Although they did not
ane) and surface species (e.g., C2H5
report reaction-rate expressions, Wong et al. reported activation bar-
riers for each of the reaction families. They also provided the nominal
values of pre-exponential factors as evaluated by transition-state
theory.

+, C4H9

Based on the pathways suggested by Wong et al. [215], Karakaya
et al. [132] proposed an elementary reaction mechanism for bi-
functional Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. The C2H4 formation pathway on
the Mo2C sites was developed according to a DFT study by Zhou et al.
[162]. The Karakaya et al. reaction mechanism, which involved 50
elementary reactions, was implemented into a one-dimensional
packed-bed computational model. In this reaction mechanism, C2H4
production over Mo2C is close to its equilibrium limit. Using pre-
viously published data from packed-bed experiments [216–218],
Karakaya et al. fine-tuned and validated the reaction model. However,
the model did not include deposit formation and catalyst deacti-
vation behavior.

Despite considerable research on MDA processes, predictive
models have yet to be developed to describe the inherently unsteady

behavior (i.e., carburization, benzene production, catalyst deacti-
vation, regeneration). Even for more traditional processes (e.g., steam
reforming), state-of-the-art surface-reaction models do not include
the catalyst deactivation behavior. Yet another problem with most
elementary-step surface-kinetics reaction mechanisms is the im-
position thermodynamic consistency and microscopic reversibility.
Because the thermochemistry of adsorbed species is generally
unknown (or at least uncertain), the detailed surface-reaction models
usually fail to satisfy the enthalpic and entropic consistency. Al-
though estimating or measuring such thermodynamic properties
may be difficult, the properties play a central role in ensuring mi-
croscopic reversibility. There is active research devoted to estimating
the thermodynamic properties needed to assure microscopic re-
versibility [219–221]. To date, most modeling research on detailed
reaction mechanisms has focused on transition-metal catalysts (pri-
marily, Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ni). Clearly, developing and validating
predictive models for the bi-functional catalysts used in MDA rep-
resent much larger challenges.

5. Reactor technologies

Although catalysts are central to both oxidative and non-
oxidative processes, the catalyst is only one factor in controlling the
overall process. Considerations such as catalyst packing, thermal
management, reactor operating conditions, and downstream gas
separations also play critical roles. Turnover rates (e.g., ethylene or
benzene produced per unit catalyst area per unit time) contribute
greatly to the process efficiency and cost. An analysis by Hall [222]
showed that separating ethylene from the other effluent gases (CH4,
CO, C2H6) is a major cost-driver. Thus, developing systems with higher
product selectivity increases product yield and also contributes to
decreasing overall process cost.

Reactor and process design involves numerous, often compet-
ing, considerations. Generally speaking, catalysts may be deployed
in packed beds, washcoat layers, or in fluidized beds. The cata-
lysts themselves may take a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from
small particles to larger pellets. The reactors can take a variety of
forms, including shell-and-tube, monolith, or planar microchannels.
A variety of membranes can be used, including micro- or nano-
porous structures, thin-film metals (e.g., Pd or Pd alloys), or

76

C. Karakaya, R.J. Kee / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 60–97

dense-ceramic ion-transport materials. The general reactor config-
uration (e.g., tubular or planar) is an important design consideration.
The following subsections discuss reactor considerations for OCM,
MDA, and membrane-assisted reactor design and operation.

5.1. OCM reactors

281

(cid:3) = −

Because OCM processes are highly exothermic ( ΔH298

kJ),
careful attention to thermal management can avoid deleterious local
hot spots and unsafe operating conditions. Limiting temperature ex-
cursions and limiting high-temperature residence time are important
considerations in process and reactor design. The CH4/O2 stoichi-
ometry, especially at the catalyst surfaces, greatly affects the product
composition. Operating conditions (e.g., flow rates, operating pres-
sure and temperature) should be established to achieve certain
temperature distributions, residence times, and space velocities.
Usually, operating conditions that avoid mass-transport limita-
tions at the catalyst surfaces are desirable.

Most laboratory-scale OCM studies are carried out in small
packed-bed reactors where catalyst particles (or pellets) are packed
within small-diameter (i.e., ≤20 mm) tubes [223]. The tempera-
ture is typically controlled by an external furnace. Small tube
diameters help to maintain radially uniform temperatures within
the bed. As illustrated in Fig. 12, the catalyst particles are held in
place by a chemically inert packing material such as silica wool. Re-
acting mixtures flow through the bed, with product species being
measured at the outlet.

Ras and Gomes-Quero [224] developed small-scale packed-
bed OCM reactors operating at temperatures between 755 and
875 °C. They showed that the small-diameter tubular configura-
tion enabled good temperature control. Alternatively, high-
performance heat exchangers can be integrated into packed-bed
reactors. A recent patent application from Siluria Technologies dis-
closed a packed-bed OCM reactor with integrated heat-exchangers
that maintain precise temperature control [225].

Although the small-diameter tubes reduce radial temperature
gradients, understanding axial temperature gradients and local hot
spots is important. Consider a premixed CH4/O2 feed entering into
a reactor such as illustrated in Fig. 12. The O2 is consumed rapidly,
causing high local heat-release rates. Senkan and coworkers have

Fig. 12. Illustration of a typical laboratory-scale catalytic packed-bed reactor in a
tube furnace.

measured local temperature increases on the order of 200 °C over
axial distances of less than 10 mm [97,226]. The reaction heat is con-
trolled by the limiting reactant O2. Thus, the methane conversion,
reaction heat, and C2 selectivity depend strongly on the local CH4/O2
mixtures.

In practice, OCM processes operate with large excesses of CH4
(typically, 5 ≤ CH4/O2 ≤ 10). Under CH4-rich conditions, the methane
conversion is limited by the deficient O2 concentration. The desired
C2 products are more stable at low O2 levels, meaning the C2 selec-
tivity is higher at low O2 partial pressures where methane conversion
is low. In other words there is a trade-off between the C2 selectiv-
ity and yield. High C2 selectivity (e.g., 70%) is possible when methane
conversion is low (e.g., ≤20%). Of course, processes seek to achieve
high methane conversion and high C2 yield.

Tye et al. published a model-based study of an OCM packed-
bed reactor with a La2O3/CaO catalyst. The results included the effects
of feed composition and isothermal operating conditions on con-
version, yield, and selectivity. The reaction chemistry was based on
the Stansch mechanism [69]. Fig. 13 shows a summary of the results.
The methane conversion depends strongly on the CH4/O2 ratio. The
C2 selectivity is high when CH4/O2 ratio is high (e.g., greater than
10). However, due to relatively low CH4 conversion at high CH4/O2
ratios, the overall C2 yield is low. The C2 selectivity is highest at 875 °C.
Due to the increased methyl-radical formation rates and the con-
tributions of gas-phase chemistry at high temperature, increasing
temperature from 700 °C to 875 °C increases the C2 yield and se-
lectivity. However, further increasing temperature above 875 °C
causes deep oxidation of C2, decreasing the C2 selectivity.
The optimum C2 yield is predicted at 875 °C and CH4/O2 ratios
around 5.

The Tye et al. study also considers the influence of isothermal
or adiabatic (non-isothermal) operation. The results show that heat
generation and temperature variations have significant influence on
C2 yield. The study suggests that feed dilution (e.g., up to 50% at
750 °C, CH4/O2 = 4) can be beneficial. The diluents can smooth the
temperature distributions and avoid the local hot spots.

A possible way to control the reaction heat and improve the C2
yield is to distribute the O2 feed axially rather than premixing. One
approach is to introduce the O2 via a membrane, such as illus-
trated in Fig. 1b. Another approach is via discrete O2 injection points
with segmented reactors or catalyst beds [226]. When the oxygen
is introduced in a distributed manner along the length of the reactor,
the local exotherms can be significantly diminished.

Stunkel et al. [227] published a case study considering several
alternative OCM reactor designs and processes. These included
packed-bed, fluidized-bed, and membrane reactors. In all cases, a
Na—W—Mn/SiO2 catalyst was used. Process performance was evalu-
ated in terms of ethylene yield. The study included the effects of
operating conditions, including temperature, pressure, reactant stoi-
chiometry, and feed rates. The experiments demonstrated that
membrane-coupled packed-bed reactors can improve C2 yield com-
pared to fluidized-bed reactors. Membrane reactors were less
susceptible to local hot spots than were packed-bed reactors.
Fluidized-bed reactors had the most uniform temperature
disctibutions. The Stunkel et al. [227] economic analysis showed that
gas-separation (especially CO2 removal) has a major impact on the
overall cost. They concluded that membrane-coupled packed-bed
reactors offered the best potential for the industrial scale OCM plants.
Fluidized-bed reactors may offer potentially better thermal man-
agement compared to packed-bed reactors. The OCM process depends
on both homogeneous and heterogenous chemistry. Methyl radi-
cals are mostly generated on the catalyst surface, with exothermic
recombination reactions taking place in the gas-phase. Hence, much
of the heat is released in the gas-phase, potentially creating large
temperature differences between the gas and the solid catalyst. The
formation rates of undesired oxidation products (e.g., CO, CO2, and

5.1.1. Modeling packed-bed OCM reactors

Models of OCM processes must be concerned with thermal be-
havior and the closely coupled interactions between temperature
and catalytic chemistry. The selectivity between desired C2 prod-
ucts and undesired total-oxidation products depends strongly on
temperature. The temperature distribution depends on catalyst ac-
tivity, flow rates, and feed composition. Local temperature
maldistribution or local hot spots can be problematic for a variety
of reasons. Reactor and process design can benefit greatly from
model-based predictive capabilities that couple thermal and chem-
ical interactions.

The accuracy of the model predictions relies on understanding
the catalytic chemistry and the physical transport within catalyst
beds. The exothermic nature of the OCM chemistry requires cou-
pling heat and mass transfer effects to predict the overall reactor
performance. Models must at least predict the gas-phase compo-
sition and temperature profiles as well as the local catalyst
temperature. Although small-diameter tubes tend to limit radial tem-
perature variations, axial variation are usually significant. An
experimental study by Senkan and colleagues [97,226] measured
the axial temperature and gas-phase concentration profiles in a
small-diameter OCM packed-bed reactor. Their results revealed very
high axial temperature and composition gradients.

The most straightforward modeling studies are based on as-
suming one-dimensional plug-flow behavior within packed catalyst
beds [76,232,233]. In such configurations radial heat and mass trans-
ports are neglected. Especially for catalysts beds that are packed in
narrow tubes, one-dimensional models are appropriate. However,
as the beds become larger, radial temperature and composition varia-
tions become important. Thus, two- and three-dimensional models
are needed to accurately represent the packed-bed performance
[234–236]. Membranes that deliver radial fluxes into the packed beds
tend to increase radial gradients, and thus increase the need for
multi-dimensional models.

istry within a one-dimensional packed-bed reactor may be

in fluidized beds tends to diminish temperature variations

for fluidized-bed reactors, compared to fixed-bed reactors [231].

fabricated from mesoporous alumina. A four-step global reaction
mechanism for the catalytic chemistry was taken from Wang and
Lin [58]. The oxygen flux through the porous membrane was
modeled using a Knudsen-diffusion model. One-dimensional plug
flow was assumed within the catalyst bed. The model predicted that
the membrane-coupled OCM reactor, operating at atmospheric pres-
sure and 750 °C, can deliver a maximum of 30% C2 yield at 53% C2
selectivity. The results also showed that a co-flow configuration was
much better than a counter-flow configuration.

Patcharavorachot et al. [80] developed a one-dimensional packed-
bed model to study OCM performance using a dense-ceramic oxide-
ion-conducting membrane. The La2O3/CaO catalyst was housed in
an interior tube, with air flowing in the exterior annulus. The
perovskite membrane (Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ) served to separate
oxygen from air as well as to deliver oxygen flux onto the catalyst
bed. The ten-step catalytic chemistry was taken from Stansch et al.
[69]. This reaction mechanism involved only gas-phase species, and
used empirical rate expressions. The simulations predicted that the
membrane could increase C2+ yield from 7.2% to 33% at 830 °C. Op-
erating at 843 °C with CH4/O2 ratio of 0.83, the model also predicted
a maximum C2+ yield of 36.5%.

Holst et al. [77] developed one- and two-dimensional models
of packed-bed OCM reactors with oxygen-permeable membranes.
The porous ceramic membranes were modeled using empirical ex-
pressions to represent the oxygen fluxes. In addition to the catalytic
chemistry, these models represented axial and radial heat and mass
transfer. Two catalysts were considered. Reaction kinetics for the
La2O3/CaO catalyst were taken from Stansch et al. [69]. This reac-
tion mechanism consisted of nine global surface reactions and one
global gas-phase reaction. The four-step global heterogeneous re-
actions for the Li/MgO catalyst were taken from Wang and Lin [58],
who also considered oxygen-ion transport membranes. Addition-
ally, four global gas-phase reactions were taken from Lane and Wolf
[102]. The Holst et al. study emphasized the importance of radial
concentration gradients that resulted from oxygen flux through
membranes.

Godini et al. [79] also studied membrane-coupled OCM in a
packed-bed reactor, with a specific focus on comparing reactor per-
formance with La2O3/CaO and Na2/WO4/Mn/SiO2 catalysts. The
reaction mechanisms for the La2O3/CaO were adopted from Stansch
et al. [69]. The reaction mechanisms for the Na2/WO4/Mn/SiO2 were
adopted from Daneshpayeh et al. [115]. This mechanism consid-
ered ten reaction steps among eight gas-phase species. Similar to
the Holst et al. [77] study, the Godini et al. model also emphasized
the importance of two-dimensional models that incorporate the
effects of radial heat and mass transfer.

5.1.3. Modeling OCM membrane reactors

5.1.4. Combined OCM processes

Several computational studies have addressed the perfor-
mance of membrane-coupled OCM reactors. Predictive models
require knowledge of the chemical kinetics as well as the oxygen
transport mechanisms [77–80,237]. These studies have considerded
both one- or two-dimensional reactor models.

One-dimensional models, which necessarily assume radial
unifomity, deliver qualitatively accurate predictions of the axial con-
centration and temperature profiles. However, a study by Holst et al.
[77] showed the possibility of significant differences between one-
and two-dimensional models, with the two-dimensional models
being able to more accurately represent measured experimental data.
Incorporating radial variations in the oxygen composition played
a major role in predicting the overall temperature and composi-
tion fields.

Koa and Lin [237] modeled a membrane coupled OCM reactor
and compared the results with a packed-bed reactor without a mem-
brane. The Li/MgO catalyst was housed within an inner tube, with
oxygen flowing in an outer annular space. The membrane was

Godini et al. [238] introduced a reactor concept that integrated
dry reforming of methane and OCM reactions. As illustrated in Fig. 14,
the reactor was designed in a laboratory-scale co-annular config-
uration. A porous-alumina membrane is used to introduce air from
an inner tube into the annular OCM catalyst bed. The reactant CH4
was introduced into both inner and outer annular catalyst beds. The
inner bed housed the OCM catalyst (Mn/Na2WO4SiO2 and La2O3/
CaO) and the outer bed housed a dry-reforming catalyst (Ni/La/
SiO2). Carbon dioxide, produced by the OCM process, is separated
via a CO2-permeable membrane and used for dry reforming within
the outer catalyst bed.

The OCM process is exothermic, while dry reforming is endo-
thermic. Combining the processes offers opportunities for thermal
balancing and control, with the endothermic dry reforming taking
advantage of excess heat from the OCM process. Moreover, because
CO2 is consumed in dry reforming, there is very little CO2 leaving
the catalyst beds (nearly 90% CO2 is consumed). Thus, down-
stream separation costs can be significantly decreased.

Controlling temperature is often important, especially for exo-
thermic processes such as OCM. Catalytic microchannel reactors can
be designed to tightly couple excess heat from an exothermic process
to supply needed heat to an endothermic processes. Fig. 15 illus-
trates an exploded view of a generic microchannel configuration
[239]. Washcoated catalyst layers are in direct contact with
microchannel networks. Depending on fabrication approach, the
“microchannels” have characteristic heights of a fraction of a mil-
limeter [240,241]. The thin-layer sandwich construction transfers
heat efficiently between the exothermic and endothermic layers.
There has been considerable research on systems that use cata-
lytic combustion in the exothermic channels to supply heat to a
reforming process in the endothermic channels. In the present
context, the exothermic channels could house an OCM process, with
the endothermic channels housing a methane-reforming process
[242,243].

Although the heat- and mass-transfer within microchannel re-
actors is highly efficient, there are challenges in achieving high-
performance results. For example, at high temperature, sealing
between layers can be difficult. The operation is passive in the sense
that there is no direct control of the flow and temperature unifor-
mity within the channels [244]. Once the microchannel reactor is
fabricated and sealed, access to the catalysts is limited. Thus, cat-
alyst replacement is difficult, which can be operationally problematic
for processes that are susceptible to carbon deposition and other
catalyst deactivation processes.

Thybaut et al. [242] introduced a novel multi-bed reactor concept,
integrating OCM and methane dry reforming (DRM) chemistry. As
illustrated in Fig. 16, the OCM and methane dry reforming (DRM)
chemistry take place in parallel, using small-scale staged catalytic
packed-beds. The two gas streams remain separated, enabling the
two processes to operate at different temperatures, pressures, and
flow rates. Gas-phase heat exchangers transfer excess heat from the
exothermic OCM reaction to the endothermic DRM process. Thybaut
et al. designed the microchannel heat exchangers in a cross-flow
configuration, but with baffel sections yielding partially counter-
flow performance.

The small-scale reactors are insulated, seeking nominally
adiabatic performance within individual reactors. Thus, the gas tem-
perature within the exothermic reactors increases and the gas
temperature within the endothermic reactors decreases. However,
because the reactors are small, the temperature excursions are small.
The heat exchangers between stages reduce the temperature of the
exothermic stream and increase the temperature of the endother-
mic stream. Although the temperatures within the reactors vary in

mic and exothermic catalysts.

a step-wise manner, the temperature steps are small. Thus, staging
the small-scale unit processes delivers an approximately continu-
ous result. An advantage of staging is that the small-scale packed-
bed reactors can be maintained or replaced as needed. Thybaut et al.
suggested that five stages are sufficient to provide good perfor-
mance (Fig. 16 shows three stages).

Using computational simulation, Tiemersma et al. [245] studied
the possibility of designing dual-function catalysts within single cat-
alyst particles. The inner core of the spherical catalyst particles was
a steam-reforming catalyst (e.g., Pt/Al2O3). The outer shell was an
OCM catalyst (e.g., La2O3/CaO). The two active catalyst regions were
separated by a chemically inert annular region. Combining the two
catalytic functions within individual particles enabled close thermal
and chemical integration of the endothermic steam reforming and
the exothermic OCM. Tiemersma et al. [246] went on to explore the
possibility of integrating the dual-function catalysts into a co-
annular, packed-bed, membrane reactor. Oxygen was introduced
through the central porous-membrane tube and CH4 and H2O were
introduced in the outer shell that housed the dual-function cata-
lyst. The model-based results showed a 36% C2 yield at 866 °C. These
approaches suggest interesting advantages of innovative new cat-
alyst and reactor concepts.

Fig. 17 illustrates a multi-layer membrane-coupled reformer
reactor [247,248]. Using ceramic ion transport membranes, this
system effectively integrates air separation with the supply of oxygen
to partial-oxidation (CPOX) catalysts. Air flows within internal
microchannels whose upper and lower walls are formed as thin
oxide-ion membranes. Aspects of the fabrication technology lead
to the relatively complex flow patterns within the microchannels.
The perovskite membrane is La1−xCaxFeO3−δ (LCF), which has the im-
portant advantage of being stable in both oxidizing and reducing
environments. The thin membrane is supported on a porous ceramic
structure, which is also loaded with the partial-oxidation catalyst.
Natural-gas flows across the external porous catalyst structures. Al-
though this system was designed for syngas (H2 and CO) production
by partial oxidation, the design approach is also applicable for OCM.
Of course, the OCM catalysts would be different from the CPOX cata-
lysts. The tight integration of air separation and catalysis enhances
process intensification.

5.2. MDA reactors

Most laboratory-scale MDA experiments are carried out in
packed-bed reactors [166,215–218], which are relatively straight-
forward to build and operate. Small amounts of catalyst (i.e., 0.5–
2.0 g) are usually sufficient for catalyst screening experiments.
Radially uniform temperature profiles can be achieved by packing
the catalysts in small-diameter tubes within furnaces. Although axial

temperature can vary, radial temperature variations are usually neg-
ligible with packed-bed diameters around 10 mm. Small-diameter
packed beds lend themselves to one-dimensional approximations
in computational modeling. The experimental-modeling synergy is
important in understanding and establishing chemical pathways and
evaluating reaction rates.

A few studies consider MDA in fluidized beds. Cook et al. [249]
compared the MDA performance in packed-bed and fluidized-bed
reactors. They used 4 wt.% Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. Results showed
that at the beginning of the process (up to 2 h) the fluidized-bed
reactor improved the aromatic yield up to 15%. However, as ex-
plained by the increased residence time in fluidized-bed reactors,
naphthalene selectivity was preferred over benzene. Also, at longer
time-on-stream, deactivation was more severe in their fluidized-
bed reactor compared to packed-bed reactor. The relatively rapid
fluidized-bed deactivation was attributed to the particle–particle
collisions and weak mechanical stability of the catalyst particles.
Gimeno et al. [250] presented a cylindrical catalytic two-zone
fluidized-bed reactor. The fluidization was accomplished primari-
ly via mechanical stirring. Methane was introduced axially downward
from the top of the reactor and combinations of O2, H2O, and CO2
were introduced axially upward from the bottom of the cylindri-
cal reactor. Product gases were extracted radially outward near the
top of the reactor. The catalyst particles recirculated between the
upper and lower zones. The upper portion of the two-zone reactor
was responsible for the MDA chemistry. The lower portion of the
reactor was intended to promote continuous in-situ catalyst regen-
eration. The concept delivered good catalyst stability and aromatic
yield, with the methane conversion being close to its thermody-

5.2.1. Modeling MDA reactors

There are far fewer modeling studies for MDA processes than
there are for OCM processes. At least in part, the lack of MDA re-
action mechanisms impedes the development of MDA models.
Because of factors such as relatively rapid deposit formation and
catalyst deactivation, MDA processes do not achieve long-term
steady-state operation. Thus, interpreting the experiments and es-
tablishing relatively simple global reaction pathways and rates is
difficult. Moreover, because the catalyst continuously changes (car-
burization and deactivation), the MDA process is inherently transient,
making modeling more complex than is the case for nominally
steady-state processes.

Modeling studies have considered both global reaction kinet-
ics developed by Liu et al. [251] and detailed reaction kinetics
proposed by Wong et al. [215] and Karakaya et al. [132]. The models
assume nominally steady-state operating conditions, with

catalyst deactivation and PAHs formation chemistry not being in-
cluded. The models are used to explore the effects of operating
conditions (i.e., temperature, weight hourly space velocity) on
product yield and selectivity [132,215]. Results indicate a strong re-
lationship between naphthalene formation rate, temperature, and
residence times. Increasing temperature and residence times gen-
erally increase the methane conversion toward equilibrium. However
as conversion increases, naphthalene formation is favored over
benzene. Seeking to increase both methane conversion and benzene
yield, a number of computational studies have investigated the effects
of incorporating hydrogen-permeable membranes.

The Iglesia group considered membrane-assisted MDA in tubular
reactors [18,213]. A 4 wt.% Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst bed was housed
within a tube, with the tube walls forming the hydrogen-permeable
membrane. The models used a global three-step kinetic model to
predict benzene and naphthalene formation rates. The modeling
results revealed a strong interaction between the operating con-
ditions, membrane hydrogen fluxes, and benzene formation rates.
The results showed that methane conversion increases as a func-
tion of hydrogen removal rate. However, benzene selectivity follows
a non-linear trend. At low hydrogen removal rate (≤5%) the benzene
yield increases slightly. As the methane conversion further in-
creases by increasing the hydrogen removal rate, the process favors
naphthalene. Experimental studies also confirm that increased hy-
drogen removal rate favors the coke formation and without a
significant beneficial effect on benzene yield [251–255]. The value
of the hydrogen-permeable membrane integration relies on devel-
oping catalysts with improved benzene selective and controlling the
catalyst deactivating coke formation.

5.2.2. Combined MDA processes

Because catalyst stability and thermodynamic limitations are
major concerns in MDA, a number of studies focus on alternative
technologies to improve the single-pass yield. One such approach
is called “one-pot” synthesis, meaning that processes can be tightly
integrated as sequential processes in single reactor. Such process
intensification can improve performance and reduce downstream
separation processes.

Samarth et al. [256] combined OCM and MDA chemistry in a se-
quential two-zone packed-bed reactor. The first zone contained an
OCM catalyst (Si/Sn/MgO), followed by an MDA catalyst (5 wt.% Ga/
HZSM-5). Combining these two processes increased both the OCM
and MDA performance (i.e., conversion, yield, and catalyst stabili-
ty). The undesired products of OCM reactions (i.e., CO2, H2O) can
be beneficial for the MDA chemistry.

Xu and co-workers [257,258] developed another two-zone reactor
concept. In this case, the first-zone OCM catalyst was a mixture of
20 wt.% SrO and 20 wt.% La2O3/CaO. The second-zone MDA cata-
lyst was 6 wt.% Mo/HZSM-5. The reactor was operated at atmospheric
pressure and 730 °C. Under these conditions the process is primar-
ily one of MDA. However, the low levels of CO2 and H2O produced
in the upstream OCM section served to enhance catalyst stability
and increase benzene yield over 16 h of time-on-stream [257].
Similar trends were observed with the MDA catalyst being 6 wt.%
Mo/MCM-49. In this case, the study reported 5% aromatic yield for
up to 72 h time-on-stream [258].

MDA chemistry has also been used to enhance the efficiency of
coal pyrolysis. Jin et al. [259] designed and developed a two-zone
packed-bed reactor. The first zone was supplied with methane over
a 4 wt.% Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. The coal to be pyrolyzed was intro-
duced into a catalyst-free second zone. Results showed that
combining MDA with coal pyrolysis beneficially improved the desired
tar yield by around 40% at 700 °C and 1 atm. The increased tar yield
from the combined process was attributed primarily to the partic-
ipation of free radicals that were formed in the MDA zone.

The 13C-labeled methane facilitates understanding the role of methane [267].

Li et al. [260] demonstrated a two-zone reactor in which the flash
pyrolysis of coal was followed by aromatization. The pyrolysis took
place in an upstream reactor zone, followed by MDA chemistry in
the second zone. Methane was a product of the coal pyrolysis. The
study reported that the downstream MDA promoted the aromati-
zation of olefins and alkanes, and the dehydroxylation of phenolic
compounds.

Huang et al. [261] demonstrated a combined bio-fuel pyrolysis
and MDA process in a two-stage catalytic reactor. The pyrolysis pro-
duces a methane-rich gas stream. Methane-rich gas from the
pyrolysis reaction was fed to a second-stage reactor, which housed
a packed-bed MDA catalyst (HZSM-5 with 3 wt.% Mo and 3 wt.% Cu).
The C6—C12 yield was improved compared to the bio-fuel pyroly-
sis alone. The approach showed the potential of improving the
conversion of bio-derived fuels to bio-oils.

Although MDA processes generally require high temperature to
activate methane, combining processes can assist in reducing overall
process temperatures. For example, Majhi et al. [262] studied com-
bined methanol and methane aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 and
Zn—Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts. Unlike the endothermic methane aroma-
tization, methanol aromatization is exothermic. By mixing 1.6–
2.5% methanol in the methane feed, the reaction temperature of MDA
°C . Full methanol conversion was
was decreased to 550
reported at temperatures above 500 °C. The Zn incorporation into
the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst increased methane conversion from 18% to
22% at 650 °C. The product composition was mainly C6H6, C7H8, and
C8 and C9+ aromatics. Benzene selectivity was around 20–30%, which
is relatively low, compared to pure methane aromatization. Gradual
catalyst deactivation was observed during 5 h on stream.

A number of investigations have shown that co-feeding higher
hydrocarbons with methane offers the possibility of reducing MDA
operating temperatures. Co-aromatization studies have included
several hydrocarbons, including ethane [263,264], propane
[265–269], butane [270], pentane [271], hexane [272], light gaso-
line (C5 and C6 mixtures) [273], and alkenes (butene, iso-butene,
propene) [265]. These studies have used a variety of zeolite cata-
lysts with second-metal incorporation (Ga, Mo, Zn, Mo—Zn, La—Zn,
Co—Zn). Although the co-aromatization of methane with higher hy-
drocarbons increases the methane conversion and aromatic yield,
the catalyst deactivation is more rapid compared to MDA alone
[264,266,274]. Thus, although several studies have been reported,
the benefits of co-aromatization remain somewhat inconclusive.
Using isotopically labeled 13CH4, Luzgin et al. [267,269] studied
the co-aromatization of methane with propane over Zn- and Mo-
°
containing H-BEA zeolites at 550
C. Fig. 18 illustrates CH4
reaction pathways with propane co-aromatization. Solid-state NMR
and GC-MS analyses showed that in the presence of propane, aro-
matization proceeds primarily via propane conversion to benzene,
toluene, or xylene. These reactions are highly favorable due to low

Despite reports of the benefits associated with hydrocarbon
co-aromatization processes, there is also dissenting literature. A
recent study of Bijani et al. [274] questioned the effectiveness of
propane co-aromatization. Using a thermodynamic analysis, they

evaluated the effect of temperature ( 400

(1 ≤ p ≤ 10 bar), and methane-to-propane ratio ( 0

The thermodynamic analysis supported the idea that equilibrium
methane conversion could not exceed 1% when propane is co-fed
at temperatures below 600 °C and atmospheric pressure. Bijani et al.
supported their analysis by experimentally studying the effects of
temperature, gas-hourly space velocity, and CH4/C3H8 ratio over a
Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst in a packed-bed reactor at atmospheric pres-
sure. They measured the aromatic yield as well as the CH4 and C3H8
conversion as functions of time-on-stream. Higher temperatures not
only enhanced aromatic formation, but also increased coke forma-
tion by pyrolysis of the thermodynamically less-stable propane.

The Bijani et al. results are consistent with an earlier study of
Naccache et al. [275] who studied co-aromatization of olefins (C2H4
and C3H6) over Ga doped MFI. By labeling the carbon in the methane,
Naccache et al. showed that labeled carbon was not incorporated
into the reaction products. Apparently the methane is essentially
unreactive during co-aromatization.

Another concept for a combined processes involves using H2 from
an MDA process in ammonia synthesis. A patent from BASF dis-
closed a combined MDA and ammonia-synthesis process within the
same reactor [276]. The feed gas was a mixture of natural gas (C1—C6
aliphatic hydrocarbons) and nitrogen. The ratio of aliphatic hydro-
carbons to nitrogen varied between 1:1 and 20:1. The hydrogen,
which is a product of MDA chemistry, was used as a reactant in the
ammonia synthesis. By removing the hydrogen in-situ via the
ammonia synthesis, the reactor increased methane conversion and
benzene yield. A further advantage of the process is that the com-
bination of endothermic MDA and exothermic ammonia synthesis
can assist thermal management. The MDA catalyst was an MFI-
type zeolite with 0.5–20 wt.% Mo and 0.02–6 wt.% Ru. The reported

operating temperatures were 400

As discussed in Section 1.2, increasing pressure significantly de-
creases methane conversion. However, increasing pressure increases
benzene selectivity while decreasing naphthalene selectivity. In an
MDA reactor with a H2-permeable membrane operating at el-
evated pressures, it is likely that the decreased methane conversion
due to the increased pressure can be compensated by shifting the
thermodynamic equilibrium via H2 removal. In this case, benzene
selectivity can increase and the catalyst is more stable due to the
low naphthalene formation rates. Moreover, the benzene turn-
over rates can be higher due to the increased mass throughputs at
increased inlet pressure. A membrane-coupled MDA reactor oper-
ating at high pressures offers a potentially valuable approach that
merits further study.

6. Membrane materials and transport

Hydrogen- and/or oxygen-permeable membranes offer the pos-
sibility of improving methane conversion, product selectivity, and
yield. Membranes can also contribute to reducing catalyst deacti-
vation and extending productive time-on-stream. Thus, integrating
membranes into catalytic reactors may play important roles in de-
veloping commercially viable gas-to-liquids technology.

Hydrogen-transport membranes can be used in dehydrogena-
tion processes where the conversion reaction is equilibrium-
limited. By removing the excess hydrogen, the methane conversion
and hence the product yield can be increased. Consider, for example,

direct methane dehydroaromatization (Eq. (1)) to produce benzene
or direct conversion of methane to ethylene (Eq. (2)); both reac-
tions produce significant amounts of H2.

Permselective membranes can take several physical forms, in-
cluding polymers (e.g., Nafion), thin-film metals (e.g., palladium),
micro- or nano-porous ceramics, and ceramic ion-transport mem-
branes (ITM). Because of the high temperatures needed for methane
activation, polymer membranes are not relevant, and are not con-
sidered here.

Palladium and palladium-alloy membranes have very good hy-
drogen permeability, and are frequently used in hydrogen-separation
processes [277]. These membranes operate at elevated temperatures
and can be valuable for increasing conversion in dehydrogenation
processes.

Porous membranes can be effective in OCM membrane reactor
concepts. However, air separation is not possible through porous
structures. Thus, for applications needing oxygen transport, any air
separation must be accomplished upstream of the membrane reactor.
Very high selectivity can usually not be achieved. Consider an ap-
plication in which the membrane is intended to deliver oxygen into
a catalyst bed. The porous membrane may allow some undesired
diffusion of reactants and product gases back to the oxygen supply
side of the membrane. However, maintaining high pressure on the
oxygen side helps to avoid the back diffusion.

A range of ceramic ion-transport membranes (ITM) are well suited
to dehydrogenation chemistry and membrane reactors [27,278].
Broadly speaking, ITM membranes fall into two categories – one pro-
moting proton conduction and the other promoting oxide-ion
conduction.
In both cases, the membranes are based on
heterovalently doped polycrystalline structures. The so-called pro-
tonic ceramics are typically represented by doped perovskites such
as yttrium-doped barium zirconates (e.g., BaZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ, BZY10). Al-
though called protonic ceramics, these materials are mixed
conductors that conduct protons, oxide ions, and small polarons.
Ceramic materials such as yttria-stablized zirconia (YSZ) or
gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) are suitable as oxygen-transport mem-
branes. These materials, which have a cubic fluorite crystal structure,
are widely used as electrolyte membranes in solid-oxide fuel cells
and electrolyzers. Because the electronic conductivity is low they
can be polarized by applying an electrostatic potential across the
membrane. The electrostatic field promotes the migration of oxide
ions within the membrane, delivering a de-facto oxygen flux.

6.1. Palladium membranes

The fact that hydrogen diffuses through Pd has been known since
the mid-1800s. In more recent times, various Ag—Pd and Au—Pd
alloys have been developed to improve hydrogen fluxes. Mem-
branes, which are typically around 1 μm thick, are usually applied
on the outside of porous support tubes. Depending on tempera-
ture and hydrogen partial pressure across the membrane, hydrogen
fluxes are on the order of 1 mol m−2 s−1. Although research is still
active, palladium-based membranes are now produced commer-
cially. Reviews by Way and colleagues provide historical and technical
perspectives [277,279].

The effective H2 fluxes may be expressed in the form of Sieverts

where P represents the permeance (mol m−2 s−1 Pa−n), L represents
the membrane thickness, pH2 1, and pH2 2, represent hydrogen partial
pressures (Pa) at the membrane surfaces. The exponent n is ideally
1/2, but membrane defects such as pinholes or microcracks can in-
crease n. Any such defects also decrease the hydrogen selectivity.

C. Karakaya, R.J. Kee / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 55 (2016) 60–97

83

At the membrane surfaces, molecular hydrogen must react
(H2 ⇆ 2H) to form the atomic hydrogen that is transported through
the dense Pd membrane. Thus, there is the possibility that the hy-
drogen transport is rate-limited by surface reaction. However, it is
usually assumed that the transport is dominated by bulk-phase
diffusion (i.e., Eq. (41)).

6.2. Porous ceramic membranes

Because of the high temperature needed for OCM of MDA pro-
cesses, porous membranes are often fabricated from chemically inert
ceramic materials such as alumina. Membranes for MDA pro-
cesses usually demand high selectivity for hydrogen, which is difficult
to achieve via porous membranes. Membranes for OCM processes
are usually used to distribute oxygen along the length of the cat-
alyst bed. Oxygen selectivity is also a factor, but not as demanding
as for hydrogen selectivity in MDA. With a porous membrane in OCM
processes, oxygen is usually separated from air prior to entering the
reactor. If oxygen is not separated beforehand, then there will be
substantial nitrogen dilution in the catalyst bed. Because the porous
structure is not selective (or only weakly selective), back diffusion
of hydrocarbon species into the oxygen flow can be problematic.
This problem is usually minimized or avoided by maintaining a high
oxygen pressure (e.g., up to 6 bar is typical) on the O2 feed side
[280–282].

The gas flux through porous media depends on the pore micro-
structure (porosity, pore dimensions, tortuosity) and membrane
thickness. When the pore structure is relatively open, a pressure-
driven Darcy flow representation is usually appropriate. When the
characteristic pore dimensions are on the same order as the gas-
phase mean-free-path length, multicomponent Knudsen diffusion
becomes dominant. In the intermediate length scales, multicom-
ponent Fickian and Knudsen diffusion are both active.

Alternative porous-media transport models have been devel-
oped in the context of representing gas-phase transport in porous-
ceramic electrode structures for solid-oxide fuel cells [283–285]. The
dusty-gas (DGM) formulation provides an effective model for bridg-
ing all the relevant length scales in a single model [286]. The steady-
state species mass fluxes jk through a non-reactive porous membrane
may be evaluated by solving a mass-conservation problem as

∇ ⋅

=jk 0.

(42)

The DGM is an implicit relationship among the gas-phase species
molar fluxes Jk, molar concentrations [Xk], concentration gradi-
ents, and the pressure p gradient as,

Knudsen diffusion represents molecular diffusion and mass trans-
port assisted by gas–wall collisions. The Knudsen diffusion
coefficients depend upon the porous-media microstructure, includ-
ing porosity φg, average pore radius rp, and tortuosity τg. The effective

where dp is the particle diameter. Equation (45) is based on packed
spheres. Although the functional forms remain similar, the perme-
ability relationship can vary depending on the material. Porosity is
relatively easy to measure and effective particle diameters and pore
radii can be reasonably estimated from microscopic images of the
membrane. Permeability is also relatively easy to measure. However,
transport depends strongly on tortuosity, which is difficult to
measure. Thus, tortuosity is often used as an empirical parameter
that is adjusted to fit flux measurements. Details about the DGM
and the computational implementation have been reported by Zhu
et al. [284].

High temperature and humid oxidizing environments can limit
the choice of materials that are suitable for OCM membranes. Pore-
modified alumina is often used for OCM processes [96,288,289].
Readily available porous alumina can have a pore structure that is
too open and permits oxygen fluxes that are too high. Silica (SiO2)
or silicon oxy-carbide (SiOC) can be deposited within the pores, re-
stricting the flux [282,288,289].

Zeolites are used for separations, and in principle could be used
as hydrogen-selective membranes [290–293]. However, the selec-
tivity is not high. Zeolite pore diameters are generally in the range
of 0.3–1.3 nm. However, the effective diameters of light gases and
H2 are similar, with the effective diameter of H2 being 0.289 nm.
The effective diameters of CO2, CO, and CH4 are 0.33 nm, 0.376 nm,
0.38 nm, respectively. Thus to achieve good selectivity the zeolite
cage size would need to be very closely controlled. Recent ad-
vances in zeolite technology have enabled the modification of cage
sizes without changing the framework and cage structure
[291,292,294,295]. Zeolite membranes have been investigated for
applications in water–gas-shift processes [296] and hydrocarbon
dehydrogenation processes below 550 °C (e.g., isobutane, cyclo-
hexane) [297,298]. To date, zeolite membranes have apparently not
been used in MDA processes. Nevertheless, with continued devel-
opment of zeolite materials, new zeolites may offer opportunities
for small-channel zeolites as alternatives to dense ion-transport
membranes.

6.3. Oxide-ion conducting membranes

Materials such as yttria-stablized zirconia conduct oxide ions O2−
via a hopping mechanism within the doped crystal structure. The
heterovalent doping creates lattice vacancies, which enable oxide-
ion mobility. The ionic conductivity is typically represented as

react at one membrane surface to incorporate the ion into the mem-
brane lattice and release the O2(g) back to the gas phase on the
opposite side of the membrane. The incorporation process can be
represented globally as

where e−(ed) represents electrons within the electrode and O2−(el)
represents the ion within the electrolyte membrane. Thus, a so-
called triple-phase boundary is needed where gas, electrode, and
electrolyte are coincident. The oxide-ion transport depends on the
establishment of an electrostatic potential, and thus an external
circuit to provide electrons. There is very little transport associ-
ated with oxygen partial-pressure variations across the membrane
alone.

6.4. Mixed ionic–electronic conductors, MIEC

Mixed-conducting materials such as BaZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ (BZY10) or
La1−xCaxFeO3−δ (LCF) behave differently from materials such as YSZ.
Depending on the particular material, the membrane may perform
dominantly as a proton conductor or as an oxygen-ion conductor.
Also, depending on the material, any electronic conduction may be
dominantly “n-type” (i.e., electrons) or “p-type” (i.e., electron holes).
When the gas-phase composition varies across the membrane,
the electrochemical-potential gradient serves to drive charged defects
through the membrane. The result is apparent gas transport through
the membrane. At each gas–membrane interface gases must react
to form the defects that can be transported through the mem-
brane. Depending on the material and the operating conditions, these
defect-incorporation reactions may be equilibrated or they may be
kinetically limited. The defect fluxes within the membrane depend
on concentration and electrostatic-potential gradients. Mathemat-
ically, the defect fluxes are governed by Nernst–Planck–Poisson
theory [300–303].

Assuming dilute behavior (i.e., minimal defect–defect interac-
tions), the charged-defect fluxes through MIEC doped-perovskite
materials are governed by the Nernst–Planck relationship as

The nomenclature OO

oxygen lattice site. In a departure with earlier studies [302,304], Zhu
et al. [19] represent the electronic charge carrier as a small polaron

hole h•.

The gas–surface chemistry may be equilibrated or may be ki-
netically rate-limited [303]. In either case, the Nernst–Planck model
needs equilibrium constants to establish boundary conditions and
in rate-limited circumstances to maintain microscopic reversibili-
ty. The equilibrium constants can be evaluated in terms of the
reaction thermodynamics (i.e., Gibbs free energy changes). Al-
though sometimes difficult to obtain, thermodynamic properties can
be established experimentally [19].

The Nernst–Planck fluxes must be constrained by site balances
and charge neutrality, with details depending on the particular mem-
brane material. For BZY10, the number of oxygen sites in a pervoskite
lattice (per formula unit) must be maintained as 3. Thus,

An interesting aspect of mixed-conducting membranes is so-
called “uphill diffusion” [305–307]. That is to say, the apparent
transport of some gas-phase species may be proportional to the
partial pressure gradient across the membrane (i.e., not propor-
tional to the usual negative partial-pressure gradient as in Fick’s law).
For example, the apparent flux of water vapor may be in the di-
rection from low partial pressure on one side of the membrane to
high partial pressure on the other side. However, all the charged-
defect transport must be proportional to the negative gradient in
electrochemical potential,

where μk

Because of the role played by the internal electrostatic-potential gra-
dient, the apparent gas-phase transport can sometimes appear to
be going in a direction opposite from what would be expected by
Fickian diffusion.

To illustrate aspects of proton-conducting membrane behavior,
Fig. 19 shows a representative model-predicted result [302]. In this
case a tubular 20 μm thick membrane is positioned on a 10 mm di-
ameter support. The inside of the tube is dominantly H2, but with
varying low levels of H2O. The outside of the tube has a gas atmo-
sphere of 90% Ar and 10% O2 and trace steam. The right- and left-
hand panels show defect fluxes and effective gas-phase fluxes at the
membrane surfaces. The effective gas-phase fluxes are in the range
of 10−3 mol s−1 m−2. Under the operating conditions shown, gas-
phase H2 leave the central tube but, because of reaction with oxygen,
emerges from the membrane exterior as H2O. The central panel il-
lustrates defect profiles as well as electrostatic potential profiles.

figure is reproduced from Kee et al. [302].

Note that internal electrostatic potential variations on the order of
100 mV are needed to preserve charge neutrality. Of course, details
of the defect transport and apparent gas-phase fluxes depend on
operating conditions. Sanders et al. [307] developed maps that
explore large ranges of operating space.

6.4.2. Oxygen-ion transport membranes

Consider the behavior of La1−xCaxFeO3−δ (LCF) as an MIEC oxide-
ion conducting membrane. This material is important for application
in hydrocarbon membrane reactors because, unlike many other
MIEC oxide-ion conductors, it is stable in both oxidizing and
reducing environments [308–313].

Because LCF does not have the ability to incorporate protons, the
incorporation chemistry is different from materials such as BZY10.
As reported by Geary and Adler [314], the incorporation and dis-
proportionation chemistry can be represented in Kröger–Vink
notation as

The B-site Fe in this material can be simultaneously present in
three oxidation states, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Fe4+. Thus, at the surface and
within the bulk, Eq. (60) represents the interactions between three
Fe oxidation states. Geary and Adler [314] reported thermody-
namic properties from which the equilibrium constants can be
evaluated.

As is the case with the BZY10, the equilibrium composition must
be constrained by site and charge balances. For the LCF materials,

Based on small-parameter-expansion analysis, Bazant and col-
leagues have shown that second-order (i.e., very small) variations
in the charge density cause leading-order (i.e., large) variations in
the electrostatic potential [317,318].

Equations (65) and (66) form a coupled system of nonlinear
partial differential equations that can be solved computationally. The
solution depends on initial and boundary conditions. The bound-
ary conditions depend on the defect-incorporation chemistry at the
gas–membrane interfaces, which establish the boundary defect

6.4.3. Ion-transport membrane conductivity

The electrical conductivity is an important measure of charged-
defect mobility within ion transport membranes. Although ITMs are
generally all polycrystalline oxides, their properties vary greatly.
Kreuer’s 2003 review of proton-conducting ceramics showed that
conductivity varies by orders of magnitude as functions of mate-
rial composition and temperature, with doped barium cerates and
barium zirconates having the highest conductivities [315].

Fig. 22 illustrates measured conductivities for two perovskite ma-
terials that are relevant for membrane reactors [19,316]. The BZY10
is primarily a proton conductor that is suitable for MDA pro-
cesses. The (La0.8Ca0.2)0.95FeO3−δ (LCF) is primarily an oxide-ion
conductor that is suitable for OCM processes. There is a great dif-
ference in functional behaviors between these two materials. The
BZY10 conductivity is approximately four orders of magnitude
smaller than that of the LCF. The BZY10 conductivity is a strong func-
tion of oxygen partial pressure in the oxidizing environments, but
nearly constant in reducing environments. The LCF conductivity
shows relatively weak pressure and temperature dependence. The
high conductivity of the LCF is primarily the result of high elec-
tronic conductivity relative to the oxide-ion conductivity. By contrast,
the BZY10 has low electronic conductivity, with the total conduc-
tivity being dominated by the partial conductivities of protons and
oxide ions.

The electronic conductivity has important implications in mem-
brane technology. Because materials such as YSZ or BZY have low
electronic conductivity, they can be polarized to establish an
electrostatic-potential field within the membrane. The field then
can be used to promote ion transport (cf., Eq. (49)).

concentrations. The boundary conditions for the electrostatic po-
tentials depend on circumstances such as if the membrane is
polarized by an external circuit. The governing equations and bound-
ary conditions are further constrained by imposition of site balances
and electroneutrality, the details depending on the particular
materials.

Details of the Nernst–Planck–Poisson (NPP) model and the com-
putational solution can be found elsewhere [19,20,301–304,
317–320].

6.5. Ion-catalyst interactions

If a catalyst is placed directly onto an ion-conducting mem-
brane, then there is the possibility that the catalytic chemistry may
be influenced by electrochemistry. In a great many papers, Vayenas
and colleagues, as well as others, developed theory and discussed
processes that are labeled as “non-Faradaic electrochemical mod-
ification of catalytic activity” (NEMCA) or “electrochemical promotion
of catalysis” (EPOC) [321–326]. Early research by Gür and Huggins
considered NO decomposition in a solid-state electrochemical cell
[327]. Electrochemical promotion is based on the idea that ionic
species emerging from a mixed-conducting electrolyte membrane
are catalytically more reactive than the equivalent charge-neutral
species in the gas phase. Thus, in addition to effective and selec-
tive gas transport to and from the catalysts, ion-conducting
membranes may offer additional benefits in enhancing the cata-
lytic behavior.

A comprehensive review paper in 2000 by Stoukides [328] dis-
cussed NEMCA effects for a wide range of processes, including
methane CPOX, OCM, CO and H2 oxidation, NOx decomposition,
alkane and alkene oxidation, oxidation and decomposition of sulfur
oxides, methanol oxidation, oxidation and dehyrogenation of aro-
matics, oxidation, decomposition and synthesis of ammonia. An
earlier review by Eng and Stoukides [329] considered NEMCA effects
for methane partial oxidation to CO and H2, discussing interac-
tions with solid-oxide fuel cells. This paper also discussed NEMCA
effects for OCM processes. A later review by Vayenas et al. [330] dis-
cussed the concepts of electrocatalysis, electrochemical promotion,
and metal–support interactions for methanol and ethylene oxida-
tion processes.

6.6. Membrane summary characteristics

Table 2 summarizes some of the salient characteristics of alter-
native membranes, especially as they may affect membrane-
reactor applications.

Despite their potential benefits, all the membrane approaches
must deal with some practical difficulties. For example, at high op-
erating temperatures sealing can be very challenging. Especially in

the cases of ceramic membranes, a ceramic-metal seal is usually
needed. A range of glass based seals have been developed and used
in fuel-cell applications, but long-term leak-free reliability remains
elusive. In the case of thin-film membranes (e.g., palladium or ion-
conducting ceramics) the fabrication of large-area defect-free
materials is difficult. Even small pinholes or micro-cracks can sig-
nificantly degrade membrane performance. Beyond the initial defect-
free fabrication, the thin membranes (typically on the order of tens
of microns) must remain mechanically, chemically, and thermally
stable on their underlying support structures.

7. Membrane reactor technology

As noted in the foregoing discussion, membranes can potential-
ly play important roles in the spatially distributed introduction of
oxygen or the removal of hydrogen to improve the process perfor-
mance [331]. However, the close integration of membranes and
catalysts in different reactor configurations remains an active re-
search topic. This is especially the case for mixed-conducting and
ion-transport membranes. In addition to simply shifting reaction
equilibrium, membranes that can achieve spatially varying fluxes
can beneficially affect the interactions between chemistry and trans-
port within a catalyst bed.

Membrane reactors for direct methane conversion processes are
typically implemented in a co-annular configuration with packed-
bed catalysts. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 23, the catalyst bed is in
the annular space and the sweep gas flows through an inner tube.
The tube is usually fabricated as a porous support with a thin mem-
brane applied to the outside of the tube. However, reactors can also
be configured with the catalyst bed being housed within the inte-
rior tube and the sweep gas flowing through the annular region.
Fig. 23 illustrates a co-annular membrane reactor in which the
membrane may be electrically polarized. In this case, electrodes must
be attached to both sides of the membrane. Assuming that the mem-
brane is dominantly an ion conductor with minimal electronic
conductivity (e.g., BZY10), an external power source can be used
to impose an electrostatic-potential gradient within the mem-
brane [20]. As is evident from the form of the Nernst–Planck flux
(Eq. (49)), the ion fluxes can be increased by increasing the
electrostatic-potential gradient ∇Φ.

Although the mixed-conducting ceramics are ionic conductors,
the ion conductivities are usually low, which is manifested as a high
ionic resistance. Thus, polarization can be a significant operation-
al cost (i.e., buying electricity) associated with using the external
power source to drive ions through the membrane. Moreover,
because electrode design and attachment can be difficult and
complex, there can be significant capital cost. Nevertheless, de-
pending on the process, improvements in flux rates and process
control may offset the cost and complexity.

Fig. 24. Button-cell, stagnation-flow, reactor design with membrane-coupled OCM
process [334].

If electrodes (such as in Fig. 23) are configured with segmented
electrical connections, then it may be possible to control the axial
profiles of ion fluxes through the membrane. The opportunity to
control fluxes by electrical polarization is only possible with ion-
conducting membranes. Metal membranes such as palladium, which
are electrical conductors, cannot be polarized. Similarly, mem-
branes fabricated from insulating materials, such as ceramic nano-
filtration membranes, offer no benefits from polarization.

As illustrated with the expanded balloon in Fig. 23, it is possi-
ble with mixed ionic–electronic ceramic (MIEC) membranes, to have
protons being transported in one direction and oxide ions being
transported in the other direction [307]. Thus, for membrane-
assisted MDA processes it is possible to have the benefits of hydrogen
flux from the catalyst bed and steam flux into the catalyst bed. Po-
larized membranes can be helpful in realizing this circumstance.
Membrane reactors typically incorporate the catalysts as packed-
beds. However, the catalyst could also be washcoated onto a
membrane or the support structure. Such washcoated catalysts can
be found in laboratory-scale experiments [281,332,333]. Washcoated
monoliths are common in many industrial processes and in appli-
cations such as automotive catalytic converters.

At the laboratory scale, membrane reactors can also be config-
ured in a stagnation-flow configuration [309,310,334,335]. In these
configurations, such as shown in Fig. 24, the membrane takes the
form of a disk. The catalyst may be either washcoated on the mem-
brane or packed with the catalyst particles above the membrane.
Such reactors can also be polarized. In this case, the experimental
setup is very much the same as is common for so-called button-
cell fuel-cell experiments. Fig. 24 shows an oxygen-transport
membrane as might be used in converting methane to ethylene via
a membrane-assisted OCM process. Although stagnation-flow re-
actors are especially valuable in studying reaction chemistry and
membrane properties, upscaling to commercially viable reactors is
usually impractical.

8. Hydrogen-membrane assisted processes

Although hydrogen-permeable membranes can play signifi-
cant beneficial roles in dehydrogenation processes, there are
potentially deleterious competing effects. For example, as H2 is
removed from hydrocarbon streams, there is significant propensity

for catalyst-deactivating carbon deposits. Additionally, even though
conversion of the parent fuel (e.g., CH4) may increase, the product
selectivity may shift toward less desired products. In MDA, as H2
is removed, the product selectivity shifts toward naphthalene (and
higher PAH) and away from the desired benzene. Thus, simply in-
creasing H2 flux through the membrane is not always desirable.
Because they can also transport oxygen defects, membranes such
as the perovskite protonic ceramics may offer advantages com-
pared to membranes that are purely hydrogen selective (e.g.,
palladium).

In principle, hydrogen membranes can be used to assist direct
conversion of methane to ethylene under non-oxidizing environ-
ments (i.e., Eq. (2)). However, although conversion may increase,
removing the excess H2 can cause severe catalyst deactivation. The
high temperatures needed for the direct conversion to ethylene
promote more carbon deposits than is the case for MDA process that
operate at relatively lower temperature (cf., Fig. 3). Hence, the use
of hydrogen membranes in non-oxidizing environments is usually
impractical.

8.1. Pd-based H2 membranes

Larachi and co-workers studied membrane-coupled MDA pro-
cesses using Pd-alloy membranes with porous stainless-steel
supports [252–254]. These studies used packed-bed catalysts in a
shell-and-tube configuration at temperatures between 500–
700 °C. The HZSM-5 catalysts used 3 wt.% Mo and 0.5 wt.% Ru.
Although H2 removal via the membrane nearly doubled the C6H6
yield, the carbon deposits caused severe catalyst deactivation [252].
In a subsequent publication, this group showed that the carbon de-
posits are in the form of both graphitic carbon and polyaromatic
hydrocarbons. The catalyst could be regenerated by flowing hydro-
gen. However, although the short-term C6 yield could be increased
using the membrane, the productive time-on-stream decreased [253].
Wang et al. [336] used a Pd—Ag membrane coupled with an MDA
packed-bed reactor with a Re/HZSM-5 catalyst. The temperature and
gas-hourly space velocities were relatively low (T = 585 °C,
). Although the membrane increased methane
120
conversion by as much as to 50%, the maximum methane conver-
sion was still low at less than 7.5%.

Kinage et al. [337] coupled a Pd membrane disk in a packed-
bed reactor loaded with 3 wt.% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst operated at 610 °C.
The results showed that the hydrogen-permeable membrane in-
creased methane conversion as well as the aromatic (benzene,
toluene, and naphthalene) yield. However, they also reported that
carbon deposits on the Pd membrane significantly decreased the
hydrogen flux through the membrane.

A study by Natesakhawat et al. [255] reported the results of
membrane-coupled MDA reaction in an annular packed-bed reactor
with a 4 wt.% Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. Using a 125 μm thick Pd mem-
brane and operating at 700 °C, they reported severe catalyst
deactivation rates with or without the membrane. The coke also de-
posited on the Pd membrane, significantly decreasing the hydrogen
transport rate. At the reaction conditions studied, the membrane
lost 75% of the initial H2 permeability. Nevertheless, the results
showed that the membrane could increase the C6H6 yield by up to
360%, but with a very low overall yield below 2%. They reported that
the membrane efficiency was strongly effected by gas-hourly space
velocities within the catalyst bed.

8.2. Protonic-ceramic membranes

Beginning in 1998, Iglesia and co-workers studied membrane
coupled MDA proceses [18,213,251,338]. Liu et al. [251] coupled a
dense thin-film SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3−δ proton-conducting membrane with
a Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst in a packed-bed reactor. The study showed
that at temperatures below 677 °C the hydrogen membrane removed
less than 7% of the catalytically produced H2, but did significantly
increase the CH4 conversion. As the temperature increased to 720 °C,
the hydrogen removal increased to approximately 16%. At the higher
temperature the methane conversion rate not only increased mod-
estly, but also increased the yield of undesired C12+ hydrocarbons.
The catalyst deactivation rate also increased at higher tempera-
tures. Co-feeding 2% CO2 enhanced the catalytic stability and
beneficially reduced the C12+ formation rate.

The Iglesia group developed a membrane-coupled packed-bed
model to predict reactor performance, including the effect of hy-
drogen removal on methane conversion as well as benzene and
naphthalene selectivity [18,213]. The model showed that methane
conversion can be increased as the hydrogen permeation fraction
increases. However, the effect on product distribution is non-
linear. In an MDA system, the production of undesired naphthalene
competes with desired benzene yield. Thermodynamic consider-
ations show that removing hydrogen shifts the product selectivity
toward naphthalene. However, kinetics and transport consider-
ations show that there are useful tradeoffs between the hydrogen
removal rate (i.e., membrane flux), residence time in the catalyst
bed, and the benzene yield. At long residence times the MDA process
is kinetically controlled, favoring naphthalene formation. In the ki-
netically limited regime, the hydrogen removal rate should be low.
As the residence time decreases the process is increasingly mass-
transport controlled, allowing more hydrogen permeation and
favoring selectivity toward benzene [18].

In addition to MDA processes, hydrogen membranes can play
roles in non-oxidative conversion of methane to ethylene. Woldman
and Sokolovskii [339] developed an electrochemical button cell
using a proton-conducting electrolyte membrane made of
SrO(CeO2)0.95(YbO1.5)0.05 (SCY). The electrolyte membrane could be
polarized using an external power supply. Methane was supplied
to the anode side and nitrogen on the cathode side of the mem-
brane. Even without polarization, and operating at 800 °C, the cell
produced ethane and ethylene. Upon polarization the C2 yield in-
creased greatly. Apparently the SCY electrolyte membrane also acted
as the catalyst. When steam was mixed with the methane feed, the
C2 yield increased. No evidence of carbon deposits was reported.

However, in all cases the C2 yields were impractically low at less
than 0.01%.

Langguth et al. [340] also studied the use of SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3−δ
(SCYO) as a high-temperature proton-conducting membrane in an
electrochemical button cell. Methane (and moist methane) was sup-
plied on the anode side with air supplied on the cathode side. The
system did not only produce ethane and ethylene, but also pro-
duced CO and CO2. The SCYO membrane is a mixed conductor. Thus,
hydrogen can be removed from methane side, but oxygen also enters
the methane side. Water vapor was found to decrease the C2 yield
because of competitive reforming chemistry.

Liu et al. [27] incorporated a SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3−δ (SCYb) mixed-
conducting perovskite into a hollow-fiber membrane reactor.
Methane was introduced into the central tube of a co-annular reactor,
with air flowing in the outer annular space. No other catalysts were
used. The methane conversion was attributed to electrochemical
reactions at the membrane surfaces. In addition to the experi-
ments, the paper also reported a model that represented the proton
and electron hole transport within the membrane and the electro-
chemical methane conversion chemistry at the membrane surfaces.
The results showed that the membrane increased the methane con-
version as well as the C2H4/C2H6 ratio in the product stream.

With or without membranes, MDA processes are not yet com-
mercially viable. Nevertheless, there appears to be some industrial
interest. BASF recently patented an MDA application using a ceramic-
protonic conducting membrane [341]. The membrane hydrogen flux
could be driven entirely by H2 partial-pressure differences across
the membrane or the flux could be increased by electrically polar-
izing the membrane. By introducing oxygen in the sweep gas, H2
entering the sweep stream is rapidly converted to H2O, thus de-
creasing the H2 partial pressure in the sweep and maintaining a large
H2 gradient across the membrane. Ceramatec, Inc. recently submit-
ted a patent application describing a protonic-ceramic membrane
coupled with an MDA reactor [342]. This application used a
Re/ZSM-5 catalyst and operated in the temperature range
700

°
C [343].

9. Oxygen-membrane assisted processes

Oxygen-permeable membranes are most relevant for OCM pro-
cesses. As expressed globally by Eq. (3), OCM processes are intended
to produce ethylene from methane. Membrane assisted OCM re-
actors can potentially improve thermal management and product
selectivity. When oxygen is premixed into the methane feed stream,
controlling local temperature excursions associated with the exo-
thermic oxidation chemistry can be difficult. Thus, because the
chemistry is highly temperature-sensitive, controlling the product
selectivity and unwanted production of total-oxidation products CO2
and H2O can be challenging.

By spatially distributing the introduction of the limiting reac-
tant O2 via a membrane, the process temperature, and hence the
product selectivity, can be controlled. In 1985 Otsuka et al. first in-
troduced the idea of using oxygen-permeable membranes to improve
OCM processes [344]. In these studies the catalysts were Ag and
Ag—Bi2O3. The O2 was electrochemically pumped through a dense
ceramic yttria-stabilized zirconia membrane at 700 °C. The mem-
brane reactor was configured in a co-annular arrangement where
the membrane was supported on the tube side (similar to the con-
figuration shown in Fig. 23). They demonstrated that membrane-
coupled packed-bed reactor increased the C2 yield and the selectivity
compared to a typical packed-bed reactor with premixed O2 (e.g.,
Fig. 12).

In a typical co-annular OCM packed-bed reactor, the pressure
drop along the length of the catalyst bed can be significant. Thus,
the local pressure drop across membrane can vary, leading to local
variations in the oxygen flux into the catalyst bed. Locally high

90

oxygen concentrations can lead to deleterious local hot spots and
full oxidation.

9.1. Ion-transport membranes for OCM

Oxygen-permeable ITM membranes are usually doped-perovskite
polycrystalline ceramics, such as LaxSr1−xCoyFe1−yO3−δ (LSCF) or
LaxCa1−xFeO3−δ (LCF). The oxide-ion conductivity of these materials
is highly activated, with practical oxygen fluxes requiring tempera-
tures of 700 °C and higher. An additional, and possibly valuable,
attribute of the oxygen-transport membranes is that they can serve
a dual purpose of in-situ air separation as well as controlled oxygen
dosing into the reactor. However, material stability in reducing en-
vironments is a practical limitation for many oxide-ion conducting
membranes. The LaxCa1−xFeO3−δ perovskites are stable in both oxi-
dizing and reducing environments and have good oxide-ion
conductivity [308–312,314].

To achieve needed fluxes, ceramic ITM membranes usually need
to be very thin, often in the range a few tens of micrometers. Thus,
they needed to be supported on some sort of much thicker porous
ceramic structure, such as a porous tube. The mechanical strength
and structural stability of such thin oxygen-permeable ITM mem-
branes can be problematic.

Thin hollow-fiber membranes provide a structure with good me-
chanical stability [332,345–349]. The hollow-fiber structures are
fabricated using an immersion induced phase inversion technique
[346]. As shown in Fig. 25, tapered radial microchannels are open
to the tube’s inner surface [332].

Othman et al. [332] developed a catalytic hollow fiber mem-
brane microreactor (CHFMMR) for OCM applications. The hollow-
fiber tube is fabricated from La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3−δ (LSCF), which is
an oxide-ion conducting perovskite. The outer surface of the tube
forms a thin dense LSCF membrane. A thin layer of the OCM cat-
alyst composed of Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3−δ (BYS) is washcoated onto the
interior radial microchannels. The reactor is fabricated in a co-
annular configuration, where air flows in the outer annulus and
methane is introduced into the tube interior. The LSCF membrane
separates air and delivers oxygen to high-surface-area BYS cata-
lyst. The design also provides good heat and mass transfer between
the gas and solid phases. The CHFMMR reactor delivers good per-
formance, reported as 39% C2+ yield and 79% C2+ selectivity at 900 °C.

lyst introduction [332]. (a) Tube cross-section, (b) tube inner surface.

Zhu et al. [350] developed a mixed-conducting multichannel
hollow fiber membrane (MCMHF) using SrFe0.8Nb0.2O3−δ (SFN). The
“multi-channel” nomenclature means that there are four axial in-
terior channels within each rod of the SFN. This structure enables
high oxygen fluxes (0.38 ml cm−2 min−1 cm−2 at 800 °C) in CO2-rich
environments, and exhibits good thermal and mechanical stabili-
ty. The intended application was for oxyfuel combustion, not
membrane reactors. Nevertheless, such an approach may be useful
for OCM processes.

Bhatia et al. [281] measured the performance of two different
membrane-assisted OCM reactor configurations. The reactors were
all implemented in a co-annular configuration. The so-called cata-
lytic membrane reactor (CMR) used a mixed-conducting perovskite
membrane (Ba0.5Ce0.4Gd0.1Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ, BCGCF) supported on a porous
ceramic tube. The Na—W—Mn/SiO2 catalyst was coated on the inner
surface of the membrane tube. The so-called packed-bed mem-
brane reactor (PBMR) used a packed-bed catalyst instead of the thin
catalyst coating that was used in the CMR approach. Compared to
the PBMR, the CMR approach achieved significantly better methane
conversion, C2+ selectivity, and C2+ yield. The study suggested that
reducing pressure drop through the catalyst bed could improve per-
formance of the PBMR. In both cases, with the membrane delivering
distributed oxygen flux to the catalyst, the membrane-assisted pro-
cesses have the potential to deliver better results than can be
achieved with a typical packed-bed reactor.

9.2. Porous membranes for OCM

Micro- and nano-porous membranes have the potential advan-
tage of producing higher oxygen fluxes than dense ion-transport
membranes. Moreover, fluxes through porous membranes are less
temperature-dependent than are the fluxes through ITMs. However,
the selectivity for oxygen flux is lower than it is for dense ion trans-
port membranes. The oxygen fluxes are proportional to the oxygen
partial-pressure differences across the membrane. Because of its
chemical and thermal stability, porous alumina is often a material
of choice. The pore microstructure can be modified to achieve desired
oxygen fluxes.

Lafarga et al. [288] used a porous Al2O3 membrane for distrib-
uting the oxygen into an OCM processes. The reactor was a co-
annular configuration, with the oxygen flowing in the annular space
and a packed-bed catalyst within the central tube. Experiments were
conducted at 800 °C and the oxygen pressure in the annular space
was 6 bar. The high pressure was used to impede back diffusion of
hydrocarbons onto the annular oxygen flow. The membrane itself
was composed of a support structure and a much-less-permeable
thin membrane The support layer was approximately 1.5 mm thick
with an average pore size of 10 μm. The separation layer was ap-
proximately 10 μm thick with an average pore size of approximately
200 nm. OCM processes need low oxygen fluxes to achieve high per-
formance. To reduce the membrane permeability even further, silica
was deposited within the pores. In a related subsequent study,
Coronas et al. [289] used the silica-modified porous membrane and
reported greater than 40% C2+ yield at 750 °C with a Li/MgO cata-
lyst. No deactivation was reported over 34 h of time on stream. More
recently, Godini et al. [282] implemented a silicon-oxycarbide-
modifed Al2O3 porous membrane in an OCM packed-bed reactor and
reported high temperature stability up to 1000 °C. Measured results
using a Mn—Na2WO4 catalyst with varying CH4/O2 ratios showed
18.5% C2 yield and good temperature uniformity.

Based on plug-flow models, Kiatkittipong et al. [280] com-
pared OCM reactors with and without membranes. The membrane-
assisted reactors were all co-annular packed-bed configurations. The
membrane structures included porous-alumina, oxide-ion-
conducting perovskite (La0.4Sr0.6Ga0.4Fe0.6O3−δ), and electrically
polarized yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The study explored pros

and cons of the alternative reaction configurations, but did not reach
unambiguous conclusions about the best approach.

9.3. Oxygen membranes for MDA

Although most MDA research considers hydrogen-permeable
membranes, there is also some interest in oxygen-transport mem-
branes. Caro and co-workers [32] studied the incorporation of a
20 μm thick Ba0.5Sr0.5Ca0.8Fe0.2O3−δ perovskite as an oxygen-conducting
membrane. The process was implemented in a packed-bed reactor
at 750 °C and 1 bar with a 6 wt.% Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The desired
global reaction can be represented as

Compared to premixing O2 with CH4, feeding the oxygen through
a membrane increases methane conversion, aromatic selectivity, and
catalyst durability [32]. The increased methane conversion can be
explained by hydrogen removal via oxidation to produce H2O at the
membrane–catalyst interface. Low concentrations of water play a
beneficial role on catalyst stability [171,190,191]. However, there is
still catalyst deactivation owing to carbon deposits. In the Caro et al.
experiments, the methane-to-oxygen ratio in the reaction zone was
not fully controlled. Thus any excess oxygen may have caused a Mo2C
to oxycarbide (MoOxCy) phase change, which would also contrib-
ute to catalyst deactivation.

10. Summary and outlook

The direct conversion of natural gas to fuels and chemicals has
the potential to be much more efficient than first reforming to
produce intermediate synthesis gas. Assuming a hydrocarbon
product is desired, there is an inherent inefficiency associated with
first making an oxidation product (i.e., carbon monoxide) and
then reducing to produce final product. However, direct routes
such as oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and methane
dehydroaromatization (MDA) are far less mature than commercial-
ly practiced processes such as reforming followed by Fischer–
Tropsch synthesis.

Although far less mature than traditional routes via methane re-
forming, there is certainly promise for OCM, MDA, and related
processes. However, there are significant challenges that must be
overcome before laboratory-scale demonstrations can be scaled to
commercially viable processes. Broadly speaking, these chal-
lenges include finding ways to improve catalyst performance,
mitigate of catalyst deactivation, reduce coke and carbon depos-
its. In addition to designing and developing new catalysts, innovative
reactor and process design are surely needed.

Any process that involves the dehydrogenation of methane to
produce hydrocarbons faces at least two challenges. One is that hy-
drogen accumulation tends to limit conversion. Another is that
carbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbon deposits are thermodynam-
ically favored over desired gas-phase phase products such as small
olefins (e.g., ethylene) or small aromatics (e.g., benzene). Hydrogen-
permeable membranes promote increased conversion, but tend to
exacerbate catalyst-deactivating deposits.

The two most-studied direct methane-conversion processes have
two different objectives. The MDA process seeks to produce benzene
and the OCM process seeks to produce ethylene. The OCM process
is probably closer to commercial practice than is the MDA process.
The low oxygen levels in OCM tend to mitigate, but not eliminate,
the carbon-deposition problems. Compared to benzene, ethylene
is probably a more flexible product in terms of further down-
stream processing.

It is reasonable to expect that commercially viable implemen-
tation of both OCM and MDA will use some sort of membrane. The
oxygen-transport membranes are generally more mature, and several
alternative membrane technologies are available. The perovskite
mixed-conducting protonic ceramics that could be used for MDA
offer the interesting possibility of simultaneous hydrogen removal
from the catalyst and low levels of steam introduction onto the cat-
alyst bed. Nevertheless, these membranes are less well developed
than are the ceramic oxide-ion membranes.

Both the OCM and MDA processes can use a range of catalysts.
To date, the most successful OCM catalysts are in the family of
Na—W—Mn/SiO2. The most successful MDA catalysts are bifunc-
tional Mo/zeolites. However, there is continuing active research on
improving catalyst selectivity and yield for numerous catalysts and
catalyst combinations.

Commercially viable direct conversion will likely depend on
process intensification. Thus, innovative reactor and process design
and development is important. Integrating thermal control with cata-
lytic chemistry is certainly important. The innovative development
and use of membranes will likely assist process improvement.

As evidenced by 350 papers and patents cited in this review, it
is clear that there is significant and current interest in direct methane
conversion. At the same time, it is also evident that there is not yet
any direct-conversion process that has been scaled to viable com-
mercial practice. Substantial advances in catalyst performance and
reactor technology are needed.
