Progress in the design, synthesis, and modiﬁcation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has immensely 
helped expand their applications in a wide variety of research ﬁelds. Such developments offered great op- 
portunities for upgrading their eﬃciencies in diverse photocatalytic applications (e.g., N 2 /CO 2 reduction, 
H 2 generation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) through enhanced conversion/storage 
of solar energy. The MOF-based photocatalytic platforms are, nonetheless, subject to many practical prob- 
lems (e.g., inapplicability for industrial upscaling and thermodynamic instability under environmental 
conditions). In this review, the effects of synthesis/modiﬁcation strategies on MOF photocatalysis have 
been discussed with respect to the type of inorganic nodes, the modulation of organic ligands, and the 
pre-/post-synthesis modiﬁcation in MOF networks (i.e. , MOF-based composite). Particular emphasis was 
placed on the technical advances achieved in the photoelectronic/catalytic performances of MOFs in mul- 
tiple energy/environmental (redox) reactions based on both experimental and theoritical analyses. Fur- 
ther, the technical merits/disadvantages of MOF photocatalysts (in terms of structural defects, light ab- 
sorption, active sites, and kinetic/thermodynamic stability) have been evaluated in relation to quantum 
eﬃciency and charge transfer mechanisms in various photo-redox reactions. The pursuit of strategies for 
enhanced kinetic stability of MOFs have also been highlighted based on the nature/strength of coordi- 
nation modes, the inertness of metal centers, and the functionality of ligand types. Lastly, the current 
limitations of MOF-based photocatalysts are addressed with respect to their practical applications at in- 
dustrial scales along with a discussion on their future use.

1. Introduction 

Global energy consumption per capita grew by 2.3% last year 
based  on  an  estimated  demand  of  70  GJ  yr −1  in  2018  for  the 
world population of 7.6 billion [1] . This implies the use of 5.5 L 
of  oil  per  capita  on  a  daily  basis  [2] .  The  mass  consumption  of 
fossil fuels has resulted in perturbation of the natural carbon cy- 
cle, as such resources currently represent 80% of the global energy 
sources [3 , 4] . It is estimated that fossil fuel-derived CO 
2 emissions 
reached 37 Gt in 2018 [5] . Such high CO 
2 emissions are beyond the 
planet’s  capacity  to  assimilate  carbon  and  represent  global-scale 
risks in environmental systems (e.g., approximately 70% of global 
warming attributed to CO 
2 ) [6 , 7] . To reduce fossil fuel consump- 
tion and CO 
2  emissions, much research effort has focused on re- 
newable energies with many technological advancements in solar 
2 production and CO 
energy and solar-driven photocatalysis (e.g. , H 
2 
reduction) [8] . 

Typically, the photocatalytic mechanisms follow three consecu- 
tive reactions: (1) absorbed light in a photocatalyst generates ex- 
cited excitons (electron-hole ( e −/ h + ) pairs), (2) excitons are then 
transported  to  the  catalytic  centers  and  are  separated  to  gener- 
ate e − and h + photo-active sites, and ﬁnally (3) the mobile e − or 
h +  active sites react with the absorbed reactants on the catalyst 
surfaces to initiate a chemical reaction and regain electrical neu- 
trality  (i.e. ,  e −/ h +  recombination)  [9] .  One  of  the  technical  mer- 
its  of  photocatalysis  is  the  catalysis  of  multiple  redox  reactions 
per  active  site.  In  1972,  the  photocatalytic  mechanism  using  ti- 
tanium  dioxide  (TiO 
2 )  was  ﬁrst  identiﬁed  for  the  electrolysis  of 
water under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation [10] . Since then, numer- 
ous photocatalysts have been developed and reported to facilitate 
the  utilization  of  nanostructured  semiconductors  and  their  com- 
posites [11-13] . Nonetheless, most semiconductors are not practi- 
cal because of their wide bandgap energy (e.g., TiO 
2 and ZnO (3.0 
– 3.3 eV)) and their lack of operation under the visible light con- 
ditions  (~40%  of  sunlight)  relative  to  UV-light  (~5%  of  sunlight) 
[9 , 14 , 15] . To overcome such technical challenges, considerable ef- 

forts have been made to offer visible-light-driven bandgap excita- 
tion ( ≤ 3.0 eV), high carrier mobility, and low e −/ h ± recombination 
rates [9 , 16] . 

In an effort to impart sensitivity to visible light (380–750 nm), 
photocatalysts have been modiﬁed using transition-metal-organic 
complexes with organic dyes (i.e., molecular photosensitizers) [9] . 
Photosensitizers (e.g., xanthene dyes and porphyrin) coupled to a 
photocatalyst by covalently bonded dimers or coordinated assem- 
blies have commonly been used to enhance visible-light absorp- 
tion in photocatalysts [17] . The enhanced absorption capability of 
photons  in  conjunction  with  photosensitizers  was  useful  in  pro- 
moting  electron injection  from  the  lowest  unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO) of organic ligands to the conduction band (CB) of 
semiconductors with energy-rich e −/ h ± catalytic centers [9] . There 
are two criteria for such sensitizers to enhance the photocatalytic 
capability under solar radiation: (i) the aligned bandgap of the sen- 
sitizer part should be capable of absorbing visible light and (ii) the 
LUMO band edge should be engineered such that it overlaps with 
the CB energy level to enhance the rate of electron injection (e.g., 
from the sensitizers to semiconductors) [9 , 13] . Modulation of the 
LUMO/CB energy level can be achieved by tailoring the structure of 
transition metal complexes and sensitizers, but this is technically 
challenging [18 , 19] . These changes in energy levels are likely to re- 
sult in the self-quenching of dyes sensitizers due to their thermal 
instability and dissociation of the sensitizer complex [9] . In these 
contexts,  metal-organic  frameworks  (MOFs)  can  be  a  viable  and 
practical alternative to overcome the noted drawbacks as MOFs can 
act as hybridizing photosensitizers and semiconductors within one 
porous photocatalyst network. As a hybrid porous crystalline net- 
work, MOFs offer an innovative photoelectronic feature in the pho- 
tocatalytic system. 

MOFs  are  porous  crystals  that  are  theoretically  assembled  in 
inﬁnite  lattices  between  metal  clusters  (e.g. ,  secondary  building 
units or SBUs) and organic linkers (e.g., multidentate bridging lig- 
ands) through coordination bonds ( Fig. 1 ) [20 , 21] . Since the late 
1990s, MOFs have been widely proposed for use in photocataly-

erties and catalytic centers for targeted photocatalytic applications. 
For  instance, the  photocatalytic  activities  of  MOF-based compos- 
ites  can  be  categorized  in  terms  of  the  structural  roles  of  the 
photocatalytic centers, which can have three-types of active sites, 
Fig. 1 [27] . In type I, the secondary building units (SBUs, 0D metal 
nodes) act as monodispersed semiconductor dot photocatalysts in 
the lattice of the MOFs crystals. In type II, the organic linkers con- 
tain functional chromophores (as a sensitizer dye) that are consol- 
idated and isolated by the SBUs. These MOFs can act as heteroge- 
nized metal-organic dye-based photocatalysts. In type III, encapsu- 
lated photocatalytic species within the MOF pores serve as a medi- 
ator to enhance the lifetimes of charge carriers ( e −/ h ±) by trapping 
photo-excited electrons. 

The  functionalization  of  ligands  and  encapsulation  of  co- 
catalysts within MOF frameworks are commonly suggested as the 
best PSM options to improve the visible-driven photocatalytic ac- 
tivities  of  MOF  photocatalysts.  However,  the  implementation  of 
PSM methods can reduce both the capacity of active metal sites 
to  absorb  photons  and  their  potential  for  activation  due  to  the 
partial blocking of MOF pores [9] . Moreover, such a reduction in 
pores sizes induces a steric hindrance toward the target reactants, 
which may impede the mass transfer from the reaction media to 
the active catalytic centers [35] . Thus, the modular design of nar- 
row bandgaps without altering surface/porous properties is one of 
the keys to optimizing MOF photocatalysts for the effective har- 
vesting of solar energy. On this note, the development of tunable 
MOF photocatalysts with high kinetic stability and narrow bandgap 
for visible/solar light harvesting is still a great challenge for MOF 
photocatalysis [36 , 37] . According to a survey of previous reviews 
(as seen in Table 1 ), MOF photocatalysts are still insuﬃcient for 
applications,  and  the  following  areas  must  be  addressed:  (i)  ki- 
netic/thermodynamic stability of MOFs under environmental con- 
ditions, (ii) morphological engineering of MOFs for practical appli- 
cation, and (iii) scalability of MOFs for industrial purposes. Another 
hinderance to the development of MOF-based photocatalysts is the 
lack of adequate evaluation of their performance based on proper 
metrics to meaningfully compare the actual photocatalytic activi- 
ties for various MOFs in each application (e.g., energy and envi- 
ronment). In fact, the use of multiple photocatalytic performance 
metrics in literature reviews (e.g., removal percentages, quantum 
eﬃciency  (QE),  kinetic  rate,  and  turn  over  number  or  frequency 
(TON or TOF)) may help with evaluating MOF performances with 
the least biases between different MOF photocatalysts for speciﬁc 
applications. 

In this review, efforts were made to emphasize the photocat- 
alytic  capability  between  various  MOF  families  [e.g.,  MIL-n-type 
(MIL  =  Materials  Institute  Lavoisier),  UiO-n-type  (UiO  =  Univer- 
sitetet i Oslo), and ZIF-n-type (ZIF = Zeolitic Imidazolate Frame- 
works)]  in  energy  and  environmental  application  ﬁelds  using 
ﬁgure-of-merit (FoM) analysis, quantum eﬃciency (QE), and reac- 
tion kinetic rates. The utility of the currently adopted pre-/post- 
synthesis  modiﬁcation  (PSM)  approaches  employed  to  upgrade 
their photocatalytic performances is also discussed in a number of 
respects (e.g., computational analysis for the charge transfer mech- 
anisms).  The  merits/disadvantages  of  various  PSM  strategies  are 
highlighted with respect to their effects on the tunable properties 
of MOF photocatalysts [e.g., in terms of optical features and charge 
transfer  mechanisms].  The  photocatalytic  performances  of  MOFs 
are also evaluated between pristine and modiﬁed forms with a par- 
ticular emphasis on water puriﬁcation, air puriﬁcation (e.g., NO x 
2  reduction,  the  hydrogen  evo- 
and  chemical  warfare  agents),  CO 
lution reaction (HER), the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and 
organic photo-redox reactions. Lastly, the prospective strategies to 
deal  with  scale-up  constraints  (e.g. ,  scale  production,  shape  en- 
gineering,  solar-harvesting  eﬃciency,  and  thermodynamic/kinetic

persed nano-semiconductors, (b) type II, the organic chromophore or heteroge-

sis [17] , magnetism [22] , electro-conductivity [23] , sensing [24 , 25] , 
and  electronics  [26] .  In  photocatalytic  applications,  the  theoreti- 
cal bandgaps of MOFs range from 1.0 to 5.5 eV due to the struc- 
tural nature of the metal nodes and chromophore-containing or- 
ganic linkers [17] . Accordingly, the photo-electronic/catalytic prop- 
erties  of  MOFs  can  be  signiﬁcantly  improved  by  modulating  the 
structure and composition of MOFs [27] . 

In particular, MOFs can be used as ideal photocatalysts because 
both  the  metal  nodes  and  organic  linkers  can  be  readily  modi- 
ﬁed to improve photon absorption and catalytic activity. Further, 
the genuine structural features of MOF crystals (e.g., the uniform 
channels and cages) offer an effective means for mass transfer dur- 
ing photocatalysis resulting in a rapid photocatalytic rate [9 , 18 , 27] . 
Nonetheless, their practical use is constrained by the complicated 
fabrication steps for pristine MOFs with low reproducibility, high 
production cost, wide bandgap (i.e. , limited absorption of visible- 
light), and kinetic instabilities under normal environmental condi- 
tions [28] . In light of such limitations, various strategies for post- 
synthetic modiﬁcation (PSM: i.e., ligand functionalization or encap- 
sulation  of  semiconductors  in  MOFs  as  hybrid  composites)  have 
been  devised  to  impart  visible-light  absorption  capability  while 
lowering the photogenerated charge recombination rate [9 , 13] . Re- 
cently, a large number of review articles ( Table 1 ) have been pub- 
lished to address the potential advantages of the PSM strategies 
as effective options to expand the uses of MOFs in many hetero- 
geneous (photo)catalytic reactions (such as organic oxidation, CO 
2 
reduction,  water  splitting,  and  water  puriﬁcation)  [29-32] .  Such 
growth  in  research  interests  is  likely  to  result  in  numerous  im- 
provements  in  MOF  photocatalysis  (e.g.,  the  synergistic  effect  of 
coordinative metal-ligand interactions with the improved charge- 
transfer mechanism, visible-light absorption, and increased num- 
ber of catalytic sites) [33 , 34] . In addition, the versatility of MOF 
composition  (metal  nodes  vs.  ligand  type)  provides  an  eﬃcient 
route for tuning structures with desirable physicochemical prop-

2. Optical characteristics and light-harvesting of MOF 
photocatalysts 

2.1. Optical properties 

MOFs have an array of self-assembled structures with unique 
structural  and  physicochemical  features  ( Fig.  2 (a-c))  that  offer  a 
new opportunity to use them as effective photocatalysts [38 , 39] . 
Speciﬁcally, MOFs offer tunable porosity (micro/mesopores), high 
surface  area  (10 0 0–10,0 0 0  m 2  g −1 ),  high  pore  volume  (up  to 
4.4 m 3  g −1 ), acceptable thermal stability (up to 200 °C), and di- 
versity in the structural topologies and physicochemical properties. 
Theoretically, MOFs can be deﬁned as functional coordination poly- 
mers with ﬂexible porous network architectures and controllable 
open channels/pores in a 3D space. The coordinative networks be- 
tween metal clusters and organic bridging linker molecules (e.g., 
the chromophore/sensitizer part) play a crucial role in regulating 
the  bandgap  of  MOFs  [40] .  Depending  on  the  metal/ligand  net- 
work, MOFs can behave as insulators and photocatalytic (e.g., semi- 
conductor) materials with a wide bandgap range (1.0 - 5.5 eV) [17] . 
Both MOFs and inorganic semiconductors can carry out similar 
photocatalytic processes. Brieﬂy, the photocatalysis mechanism of 
all semiconductor photocatalysts (MOFs and traditional catalysts) 
is initiated by the absorption of incident photons with an energy 
equal to or larger than their bandgap energy (E g : eV) [41] . It has 
also been reported that heterogeneous photocatalysis reactions in- 

duced by both MOFs and inorganic semiconductors involve at least 
four sequential reaction steps: (1) diffusion/adsorption process of 
reactants from the bulk phase (liquid or gas) to the surface of the 
photocatalyst, (2) photo-excitation (light-absorption) of photocat- 
alysts  to  generate  e −/ h ± pairs,  (3)  redox  reactions  between  ad- 
sorbed reactants and reactive species on the surface of the pho- 
tocatalyst, and (4) desorption/adsorption of the intermediate prod- 
ucts from the catalyst surfaces [37 , 42] . Based on this sequence, it 
is often favorable to synthesize photocatalysts with larger surface 
areas  as  such  materials  are  advantageous  in  the  ﬁrst  two  steps 
of photocatalytic reactions (adsorption of reactants and excitation 
process). Further, in comparison to the traditional inorganic pho- 
tocatalysts (such as TiO 
2  and ZnO), MOF photocatalysts can pro- 
vide  sequential  bi-functionality  (as  active  centers)  during  photo- 
catalysis through the incorporation of bridging chromophore link- 
ers  and  SBUs  ( Fig.  2 (a-c))  [43] .  The  bifunctionality  of  MOFs  has 
great potential for overcoming the major drawbacks of traditional 
semiconductor-type photocatalysts (e.g., by extending the lifetimes 
of photogenerated e −/ h ± pairs and enhancing the number of reac- 
tive sites) [44 , 45] . For instance, traditional inorganic photocatalysts 
generally exhibit a large bandgap (E g  ≥ 3 eV) and fast recombi- 
nation of e −/ h ± pairs. The performance of such a photocatalyst is 
reduced by the fast recombination of e −/ h ± pairs while the absorp- 
tion of sunlight (about 4% UV irradiation) was suppressed further 
by such a large bandgap. As such, these factors still remain major 
challenges for the practical use of commercial photocatalysts (e.g., 
ZnO and TiO 

2 ) in energy and environmental applications [46] . 

Recently,  many  modiﬁcation  strategies  have  been  proposed 
to  address  the  shortcomings  of  inorganic  photocatalysts,  such

as  doping  with  metal/non-metal  elements,  implantation  with 
metal  ions,  fabricating  heterojunctions  with  other  semiconduc- 
tors, and/or dye sensitization using organic chromophores. These 
modiﬁed  strategies  were  devised  to  enhance  the  eﬃcacy  of  tra- 
ditional/nanostructured semiconductor photocatalysts through the 
modiﬁcation  of  optical  properties  (expansion  of  active  region  to 
absorb  photons),  controlling  the  number  of  catalytic  sites,  and 
employing  a  speciﬁc  charge  transfer  mechanism.  Details  regard- 
ing these modiﬁcation methods and their inﬂuence on the photo- 
catalytic activities of inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts have 
been  described  elsewhere  [47-51] .  Unlike  the  common  inorganic 
photocatalysts with delocalized CB and VB energy bands, the pho- 
tocatalytic properties of MOFs can be engineered by adjusting their 
catalytically  active  metal  nodes  and  organic  bonds  [36 , 52] .  Nor- 
mally, functionalized MOF photocatalysts have three main photo- 
catalytic active sites: (i) unsaturated semiconducting active metal 
sites (SBUs), (ii) reactive functional groups in organic linkers (e.g., 
reactive  substituents  like  Brönsted  acid  or  basic  sites),  and  (iii) 
guest species (e.g., semiconductor NPs) incorporated in the porous 
MOF frameworks by in-situ functionalization or PSM approaches 
[37 , 53] . These three active sites govern the photocatalytic mecha- 
nism over MOFs due to their effect on the electron transfer pro- 
cess. 

In most semiconductor-like MOFs, the metal centers (single or 
mixed SBU metal cluster) played a dominant role in photocataly- 
sis by acting as a single-site photocatalyst. Single electron trans- 
fer  (SET)  in  SBUs  occurs  during  direct  excitation  without  inﬂu- 
encing the organic linker ( Fig. 2 (c)). This excitation is constrained 
within  the  cluster  nodes  to  initiate  photocatalytic  reactions  in 
MOFs ( Fig. 2 (c 
1 )). In the meantime, the organic linkers act as pho- 
ton antenna to promote both light-harvesting and the SET of metal 
2 ))  [43] .  For  chromophore- 
nodes  upon  photoexcitation  ( Fig.  2 (c 
containing MOFs, such as those with photosensitizer dyes (or chro- 
mophoric ligands like porphyrin) in the networks, the framework is 
considered to be discrete molecular chromophore sensitizers sep- 
arated by metal nodes (i.e., no continued bandgap structures). In 
this case, the functional chromophoric centers of organic linkers 
play  a  crucial  role  in  enhanced  charge  separation  via  ligand-to- 
ligand  (or  chromophore  entities)  pathways  or  inter-ligand  struc- 
tures between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and 
the LUMO. Thus, the excitons and the related e −/ h ± separation are 
inﬂuenced by the long-range order of ligand/chromophores within 
the networks to facilitate catalytic activity over central SBU active 
sites [9] . For example, the photocatalytic features of MOF photo- 
2 -MIL-125(Ti)) are 
catalysts (e.g., Zn-MOF (MOF-5) and Ti-MOF (NH 
1–5 )): 
principally based on two reaction steps ( Fig. 2 (c

clusters in MIL-125(Ti)) act as direct semiconductor photo- 
catalysts  and  transporting  systems  to  enhance  the  migra- 
tion of photoexcited HOMO-LUMO charge carriers of organic 
ligands  [9] .  The  conﬁned  nano-size  features  of  the  SBUs 
effectively accelerate the surface charge migration (excited 
e −/ h ±), thereby reducing the charge recombination (i.e. , pre- 
venting self-quenching or bleaching). 

(2) Both metal nodes and organic linkers impart photoactive ca- 
pability. The organic linkers (e.g., 1,4-benzene-dicarboxylate 
(BDC)  or  NH 
2 -BDC)  serve  as  photosensitizers  (i.e. ,  photon 
antennae)  by  injecting  photogenerated  excitons  to  SBUs. 
This,  in  turn,  increases  the  redox  potential  of  the  organic 
linker  and/or  the  metal-oxo  clusters  allowing  sequential 
photocatalysis (e.g., photoexcitation, SET or EnT charge sep- 
aration/migration, and photo-redox reactions) [18] . 

As previously mentioned, the photocatalytic activities of func- 
tionalized MOFs can be adjusted through the modiﬁcation of the 
organic linkers at a molecular level (HOMO/LUMO energy levels) 
to  obtain  hybridization  or  partial  overlap  with  the  CB/VB  edges 
of  SBUs  nodes.  Such  convergent  development  of  semiconductors 
and chromophore ligands offers continuity in electron (e.g., pho- 
toinduced SET)/energy transfer (EnT) processes ( Fig. 2 (c 
3–4 )) while 
preventing the photobleaching/self-quenching of immobilized dyes 
within photosensitizer-based MOFs [54] . This is due to the unique 
photocatalysis mechanisms of MOFs, which are typically assigned 
to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), ligand-to metal charge 
transfer  (LMCT),  or  the  π –π ∗ transition  in  the  aromatic  (chro- 
mophoric) ligands [36 , 40 , 55] . 

Based  on  the  discussion  above,  the  optoelectronic  features  of 
functionalized MOFs (relative to traditional semiconductors) are an 
attractive option for promoting the two half photo-redox reactions 
via dual excitations of both nodes and organic ligands within a sin- 
gle MOF ( Fig. 2 (c 
5 )) [9] . Moreover, the tunability of MOFs and their 
diverse structures allow better functionalization and modiﬁcation 
of MOFs than the classical semiconductors. For example, adjusting 
the organic ligand in MOFs by facile functionalization with a chro- 
mophoric group can enhance photon absorption to the visible-NIR 
range. An encapsulation of noble-metal NPs (as electron reservoir) 
into the porous MOF frameworks can improve the photoconductiv- 
ity and increase the charge mobility by orders of magnitude upon 
light irradiation. In this context, lanthanide MOFs can remarkably 
enhance optical properties due to the luminescent features of lan- 
thanide (Ln) metal nodes. Nonetheless, the Laporte-forbidden f–f 
transition inherent to Ln metal ions and their high costs are still 
limiting factors when using them as photocatalysts [53] . 

2.2. Electronic properties of MOF photocatalysts based on 
computational analysis 

The exploration of MOF photocatalysis has the potential to rev- 
olutionize the environmental and energy research ﬁelds. Over the 
past two decades, enormous attempts have been made to improve 
visible-driven MOF photocatalysis with advances in-situ functional- 
ization and PSM approaches (See Section 4 ) such as: (i) use of a 
chromophoric or functionalized linkers, (ii) impregnation of noble 
metal co-catalysts as dopants, and (iii) construction of MOF com- 
posites  with  other  semiconducting  NPs  (metal  oxides  or  carbon 
materials). Such approaches also have a signiﬁcant effect on the 
conductivity  of  MOFs  (i.e.,  charge  density  and  mobility  of  e −/ h ±
pairs)  and  charge  carrier  ( e −/ h ± pairs)  separation  during  photo- 
catalysis  [13] .  Under  photoexcitation,  such  modulation  strategies 
can  inﬂuence  the  transport/hopping  of  photogenerated  electrons 
in  MOFs  via  “through  bond” and/or  ‘through  space” phenomena 
[23 , 56] . The former phenomenon is the charge transport possible 

through  covalent  linkages  within  the  MOF  porous  network  [23] . 
The latter approach is helpful for non-covalent interactions (e.g., 
π - π stacking between the adjacent ligands (i.e., orbital overlap)) to 
create an extended charge-transport pathway in a rigid MOF struc- 
ture [57] . For instance, the high electrical conductivity of Cu-MOF 
(6 × 10 −4 S cm −1 : 2,3 pyrazinedithiolate ligand) was attributed to 
the improved charge transport rate via a “through bond” pathway 
on the 2D Cu(pyrazine) sheets (as a conducting polymer) in the 
presence of unpaired Cu electrons. In contrast, the replacement of 
metal centers in M-MOF-74 (M == Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn) affected the 
electronic features of MOF due to the change in non-covalent (or- 
bital overlapping) interactions between the electroactive moieties, 
namely, the “through space” approach [58] . 

Consequently, it is crucial to determine the effect of metal node 
and ligand functionality on MOF electronic structures to facilitate 
the design and synthesis of highly photo(electro)active MOF pho- 
tocatalysts in energy and environmental applications. In fact, the 
ever-increasing interest in the MOF-based photocatalysts prompted 
researchers to use many theoretical/computational simulation tools 
to predict/pre-analyze their electronic/structural properties and ef- 
ﬁcacies for speciﬁc applications. These computational theories also 
allowed researchers to optimize structural/electronical features of 
MOF photocatalysts based on the fundamental effect of SBUs, lig- 
and functionality, and other PSM strategies on their photonic be- 
haviors (charges transfer and electronic bandgap structures) [59] . 
Among the various computational methods, there are some com- 
mon  or  preferable  options  (e.g.,  density  functional  theory  (DFT), 
ab  initio  methods,  molecular/quantum  mechanical  methods,  and 
grand  canonical  Monte  Carlo  simulations)  that  are  widely  used 
to  investigate  and  predict  theoretical  electronic/structural/optical 
properties, absolute/relative energies, and the thermal/mechanical 
behavior  of  MOFs  [56] .  These  computational  theories  have  also 
been employed as useful tools to understand the energy transfer 
mechanism on MOF photocatalysts before and after modiﬁcations 
(e.g., in terms of electronic properties, excited states, and photo- 
catalysis mechanisms). 

For example, Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) is 
commonly  used  to  calculate  MOF bandgaps based on  the differ- 
ences in the orbital energies in the ground-state (the LUCO (lowest 
unoccupied crystal orbital) - the HOCO (the highest occupied crys- 
tal  orbital))  [60] .  By  using  KS-DFT  analysis  the  LUCO  and  HOCO 
electronic states of IRMOF-1 (known as MOF-5) were found to be 
dominated by the p -state of C-O in the linker and O in the Zn 
4 O 
cluster, respectively, and the calculations showed a good match be- 
tween  the  computed  and  experimental  E g  value  ( ≈3.4  -  3.5  eV) 
[61] . The electronic features of engineered IRMOF-1 have also been 
investigated by replacing the Zn-metal node with other metal ele- 
ments (e.g., Ca, Mg, Be, Cd, Sr, or Ba ions). Interestingly, the elec- 
tronic structure of IRMOF-1 photocatalyst was insensitive (e.g., in 
terms of bandgap: E g ≈ 3.5 eV) to any such replacement [61 , 62] . 
On  the  other  hand,  the  bandgap  of  IRMOF-1  has  been  remark- 
ably tuned to visible regions (from 3.5 eV (345 nm) to ~ 1.71 eV 
(724  nm))  upon  the  substitution  of  new  chalcogen  atoms  (e.g., 
Y = S, Se, or Te) for the central O-atom in the Zn 
4 O cluster (e.g., 
4 Y) in the order of S → Se → Te [63] . Based on density functional 
Zn 
4 Y-based IRMOF series can be 
theory, the tuned bandgap of the Zn 
attributed to the effect of the electronic states of chalcogen atoms 
(Y = O, S, Se, or Te) in the Zn 
4 Y nodes and C-atoms in the BDC 
linker (i.e., HOMO band energy). 

The electronic band structures of other IRMOF (Zn 

4 O cluster) 
series also decreased by 0.2 to 0.8 eV via functionalization of the 
organic linkers with some halogen atoms (e.g., X = F, Cl, Br, or I) 
[64] . Notably, the energy bandgaps of the functionalized IRMOF se- 
ries were systematically reduced with the decreases in the elec- 
tronegativity  trends  of  halogen  atoms  (from  F →  I).  This  is  due 
to the contribution of the p -orbitals in halogenated atoms to the

electronic density of states in the energy region below the Fermi 
energy  (i.e.,  alteration  of  VB  energy).  In  contrast,  Zn-metal  clus- 
ters are mainly dominant in the CB region. Hence, the p- state of 
the halogen substituents acted as an electron-releasing group by 
± C effects (conjugated effect) through donating electrons to the 
aromatic ring. The donated electrons led to decreases in bandgap 
with increases in the HOMO energy position (organic ligand) of the 
IRMOF series. The density functional based tight-binding method 
was also used to investigate the effect of organic ligands on the 
electronic structures, geometries, and stabilities of the Zn 
4 O-based 
IRMOFs  series  [65] .  Computational  calculations  showed  that  the 
ligand type did not inﬂuence the coordination bond (Zn-O) lengths 
in IRMOF- 7, −8, and −14 ( (cid:3)R ≤ 2% relative to pristine IRMOF- 
1). On the other hand, the mechanical and optical properties of IR- 
MOFs were greatly affected by the type of organic linkers (in terms 
of molecular size and structural properties). For instance, the esti- 
mated bandgap energy was signiﬁcantly reduced using larger or- 
ganic ligands containing a larger number of conjugated sp 2 carbon 
atoms because π - π states inﬂuence the VB energy. In contrast, a 
longer  ligand  remarkably  decreased  Zn-MOF  mechanical  stability 
due to the possible free rotation of ligands along the connection 
axis of tetrahedral (OZn 

4 ) 6 ± moieties (soft MOF materials). 

The electronic features of photoactive MIL-125 (E g  = 3.69 eV) 
2 -MIL-125 (E g  = 2.61 eV) have also been discussed based 
vs. NH 
on DFT computations to assess the contribution of functional lig- 
and  moieties  on  the  photocatalytic  behavior  of  MOF  photocata- 
lysts  [66] .  Accordingly,  the  relaxation  energy  of  photogenerated 
2 -MIL-125  was  −0.19  eV  higher  in  absolute  terms 
holes  in  NH 
than  that  observed  in  MIL-125  ( −0.04  eV).  The  higher  stabiliza- 
2 -MIL-125 was mainly attributed to the electron donat- 
tion in NH 
ing  nature  of  the  NH 
2  group,  which  can  induce  repulsive  inter- 
actions  between  the  photogenerated  e − and  h ± in  NH 
2 -MIL-125 
( ± 0.46  eV  relative  to  attractive  photogenerated  charge  interac- 
tion  in MIL-125 ( −0.04 eV)). In NH 
2 -MIL-125, it  is  hypothesized 
that the photo-electrons are localized onto the Ti-oxo metal clus- 
ter, while the photo-holes are localized on the linkers [66] . This 
hypothesis indicates that the functional ligand motifs played a key 
role in determining the excited-state lifetime in MOF photocatal- 
ysis  by  controlling  the  charge  carrier  interactions.  A  similar  ob- 
servation  has  also  been  reported  using  BTC  ligands  with  cyano 
(electron acceptor) and  amino (electron donor)  functionalities to 
modulate  the  electronic  features  of  Zn-BTC  MOFs  (E g  =  2.4  eV) 
[67] . Remarkably, the use of amino- and cyano-functionalized lig- 
ands  yielded  a  signiﬁcant  narrowing  of  the  Zn-BTC  bandgap  to 
1.9 and 1.4 eV, respectively. Ab initio molecular dynamics simula- 
tions showed that this could be due to the effect of amino- and 
cyano-substitutions  on  the  VB  (dominated  by  O  2p -orbitals)  and 
CB (dominated by C 2p -orbitals) edges of Zn-BTC MOFs. Besides, 
the electron-withdrawing/donor aﬃnity of these cyano/amino sub- 
stituents can have a certain effect on the acid strength of the metal 
nodes and their associated redox potential. Such interactions can 
be accounted for by their inductive effects on the electron den- 
sity of the Zn-BTC coordination bond [68] . For instance, the charge 
accumulated  on  the  O-atom  is  remarkably  depleted  when  using 
cyano-functionalities, while charge withdrawal is expected on the 
C-atom  of  the  BTC  ring  bonded  to  the  amino-functional  group. 
The overall results suggest that the type of organic ligand (or its 
chemical  functionalization)  is  critically  important  in  determining 
the kinetic/thermodynamic stability of MOFs (See Section 6 ) along 
with their bandgap alignment during photocatalysis compared to 
4 O)  [64 , 69] . 
the  metallic  clusters  (e.g.,  Ti 
These  observations  are  consistent  with  other  reported  computa- 
tional studies in the literature [66 , 69 , 70] .

The DFT computational simulation was also used to assess the

effect of embedded fullerene (C 
of surface-mounted porphyrin-based MOF (C 

thin ﬁlms synthesized by a layer-by-layer method [71] . Notably, the 
60 @Zn(TPP) SURMOF showed a rapid charge ( e −/ h + 
photoexcited C 
pair)  generation  due  to  the  structured  donor-acceptor  interfaces 
between the porphyrin ligand and C 
60 guests. In this case, charge 
separation can occur via the transfer of photogenerated electrons 
through  the  formation  of  channel  networks  (e.g.,  from  the  por- 
phyrin  ligand  to  the  C 
60  guests)  because  of  the  electronegative 
60  guests.  Such  im- 
characteristics  and  the  low  energy  level  of  C 
provements in charge transfer mechanisms can increase the pho- 
toconduction properties of C 
60 @Zn(TPP) upon UV–visible light ex- 
citation. Detailed information regarding the use of computational 
simulations for MOFs has been provided elsewhere with respect to 
the structural, mechanical, electronic features, and charge mobility 
(photoexcitation) [56 , 59 , 60 , 72 , 73] . 

Overall, the previously mentioned computational results show 
that  chromophoric  ligands  (like  porphyrin)  and/or  encapsulated 
semiconducting guest NPs have great potential to tune the elec- 
tronic properties and bandgap energy levels of MOF photocatalysts. 
Also, it was noted that the basic properties of chemical bonding 
(e.g., in terms of functionality and electronic structure) within or- 
ganic ligand molecules play an essential role in enhancing the op- 
tical properties of MOFs due to its effect on the LMCT process, as 
validated by various computational theories. As such, LMCT com- 
plexes in functionalized MOF photocatalysts can be considered the 
predominant charge transfer mechanisms during the photocataly- 
sis process. In this respect, electron conductivity and charge mo- 
bility were used as crucial indicators to verify the semiconduct- 
ing (photophysical features) properties of MOFs and their charge 
transfer mechanisms [74 , 75] . For instance, the electrical conductiv- 
2 ]; pdt = 2,3-pyrazinedithiol) with 
ity of NKMOF-1-Ni (Cu[Ni(pdt) 
a bandgap of 2.0 eV was 1 × 10 −8 S cm −1 , which is higher than 
that of the insulator value ( ≤ 10 −10  S cm −1 ), but lower than the 
conductivity  of  semiconductor  metal  oxides  (10  – 10 5  S  cm −1 ) 
[76 , 77] .  These  results  indicate  that  NKMOF-1-Ni  acted  like  a  p - 
type semiconductor with good redox activity [77] . The charge mo- 
bility  of  MIL-125(Ti)  was  also  reported  to  be  10 −5  cm 2  V −1  s −1 
under illumination at 340 nm, which conﬁrmed charge transport 
via the LMCT mechanism [74 , 75] . As such, the controlled synthe- 
sis  of  MOFs  and  their  associated  PSM  strategies  can  offer  valu- 
able  options  to  improve  their  photocatalytic  activities  in  various 
applications. In this respect, the capacity of visible-light-induced 
MOF photocatalysts can be improved by the appropriate selection 
of metal nodes with low bandgap energies (E g ) as well as chro- 
mophoric ligands with an enhanced potential for photo-excitation 
in the visible region (e.g., relative to delocalized CB-VB bandgap in 
semiconductors) [13 , 78] . 

For  instance,  transition  metals  (e.g.,  Co 2 ±,  Ni 2 ±,  Zn 2 ±,  Cd 2 ±, 
Ti 2 ±/4 ±,  or  Fe 2 ±/3 ±)  and  lanthanides  (e.g.,  Ce 3 ±,  Gd 3 ±,  Eu 3 ±,  or 
Tb 3 ±) along with diverse multi-topic/dentate ligands (comparable 
to natural photosynthesis-like porphyrin ligands) have been widely 
used to enhance the photocatalytic ability of pristine MOFs within 
the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region [13 , 79] . A visible-driven 
MOF  (3D  framework;  E g  ~ 2.62  eV)  photocatalyst  was  also  con- 
structed  by  coordination  of  multi-dentate  N-donor  ligands  (such 
as tetrakis(4-pyridyl)cyclobutane (tpcb) with four pyridyl groups) 
with Zn(II) metal nodes [80] . Volkmer’s group also reported three 
approaches  to  lower  the  bandgap  of  most  UV-driven  MOF  pho- 
tocatalysts  [9 , 81] .  The  ﬁrst  approach  involved  increasing  the  lig- 
and aromaticity ( π - π conjugation) to offer a higher valence-band 
(HOMO) energy, which lowers the bandgap ( Fig. 3 (a)). The second 
strategy is the use of electron-rich metal nodes with a VB energy 
(unoccupied d-orbitals) lower than the LUMO level of the ligand 
( Fig. 3 (b)) [82] . The third strategy is the functionalization of the 
aromatic ligand with –OH, –NH 
3 groups to control 
the bandgap (i.e., induce bandgap shift, Fig. 3 (a)) by donating 2 p 
electrons in the LMCT system [9 , 81] . Based on the above, Fig. 3 (c)

PCN-22 showed the lowest bandgap of pure carboxylate-based Ti- 
MOFs (1.93 eV) to date due to the presence of a porphyrin-based 
ligand  (e.g. ,  tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin)  in  the  structure

2.3. Charge transfer processes upon light absorption 

The combination of hybridized chromophoric ligands and metal 
nodes in MOFs offers similar mechanistic functionality to the pho- 
tocatalytic mechanisms of a semiconductor exposed to light irra- 
diation [85] . Notably, the charge transfer onto MOF photocatalysts

occurred by two main mechanisms: MLCT and LMCT [60] . How- 
ever,  the  above  computational  analyses  showed  that  the  photo- 
redox  reactions  in  MOF  networks  mainly  occur  via  a  transfer  of 
delocalized π electrons  in  the  organic  ligand  (acting  as  the  VB) 
to  the  SBUs  (acting  as  the  CB)  through  π →  π ∗ and/or  n → 
π ∗ transitions  [86] .  This  photo-redox  process  can  also  be  im- 
proved via the enhanced energy transfer mechanism between pil- 
lared (donor-acceptor pairs) ligands or ligand/guest molecules in 
MOF-composite photocatalysts [87] . Hence, the enhanced charge- 
separation  determines  the  photocatalytic  performance  through 
a  localized  LMCT  and/or  ligand-to-ligand  charge  transfer  (LLCT) 
mechanism  from  organic  chromophore  linkers  (HOMO/LUMO)  to 
the metal nodes (VB/CB) ( Fig. 4 ) [17 , 88] . Note that the MLCT mech- 
anism in MOF photocatalysis is found rather rarely due to the well- 
separation of metal centers from each other by ligand molecules 
in the MOF frameworks (i.e., fast recombination of charge carriers) 
[53] . 

The  dominant  role  of  the  LLCT  mechanism  was  veriﬁed  by 
time-dependent  DFT  computational  analysis  for  the  optical  be- 
havior  of  MOF-5  ( λ at  350  nm),  which  was  attributed  to  the 
co-planarity between the BDC benzene ring ( π → π ∗ emission) 
and Zn 
4 O metal clusters ( Fig. 4 ) [89 , 90] . MOF photocatalysts have 
been  categorized  into  two  classes  based  on  the  design  scheme: 
“opportunistic ” (e.g., MOF-5 and MIL-125(Ti)) and “designer ” (e.g. , 
guest@MOF-5 and NH 
2 -MIL-125(Ti)) photocatalysts [9] . The former 
includes most pristine forms of MOFs (UV-driven photocatalysts). 
Their photocatalytic performance however does not meet the cri- 
teria for practical implementation due to inferior photon utiliza- 
tion by the un-tuned bandgap of HOMO/LUMO orbitals and quick 
dissipation of the excited state [85 , 88] . The latter is referred to as 
modulated/functionalized MOFs with enhanced optical properties 
toward  visible  light  absorption  [9 , 13 , 88] .  For  instance,  the  chro- 
2 -MIL-125(Ti)  photocatalyst  ac- 
mophore  amine  group  in  the  NH 
celerates  both  the  LMCT  mechanism  [from  the  excited  NH 
2 -BDC 
5 (OH)  SBU]  and  the  direct 
ligand  (acted  as  antennae)  to  the  TiO 
excitation of the inorganic oxo-Ti cluster [88] . As such, NH 
2 -MIL- 
125(Ti) exhibits eﬃcient photon energy absorption up to 520 nm 
2 -MIL-125(Ti)( h ± + + e −)) relative to 
(NH 
the pristine MIL-125(Ti) ( λ at 350 nm, UV-region) [79] . Similarly, 
the  bandgap  of  MIL-125(Ti)  (3.6  eV)  was  further  reduced  down 
to  1.3  eV  ( λ =  950  nm,  red/IR  region)  when  diaminated  lig- 
ands (e.g. , 90% BDC-NH 
2 ) were incorporated

The diffusion/transportation of localized (Frenkel) and delocal- 
ized (Wannier) excitons is commonly used for theoretical model- 
ing of energy transfer mechanisms in MOFs to explain the energy 
transfer mechanisms in semiconductors [18] . On the other hand, 
energy transfer theories by Förster and Dexter are commonly used 
to describe energy transfer mechanisms in MOFs that behave like 
semiconductors [92 , 93] . The Förster mechanism assumes that the 
transfer of energy proceeds only through dipole-dipole (Coulomb) 
interactions due to the weak coupling limit between chromophore 
ligands in MOFs. In contrast, the Dexter mechanism uses the term 
‘‘ exchange ’’ to describe electron transfer between a donor and an 
acceptor,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5  [18] .  Thus,  both  Förster  and  Dexter 
models  can  offer  information  about  energy  transfer  rates  during 
MOF  photocatalysis  [53] .  In  general,  the  energy  transfer  rate  by 
the  Förster  model  is  proportional  to  the  inverse  sixth  power  of 
the donor-acceptor distance ( Eq. (1) ). In contrast, the Dexter en- 
ergy transfer rate exhibits exponential decay as a function of the 
donor-acceptor distance ( Eq. (2) ).

effective average Bohr radius), and f A ( v )and f D ( v ) are the acceptor 
absorbance and donor emission oscillator strengths, respectively. 

In luminescent MOFs, the spin state conservation at a triplet- 
triplet  (TT) transfer of  donor/acceptor wave functions  is also  re- 
quired for the charge transfer mechanism proposed by the Förster 
theory  [18 , 94 , 95] .  This  TT  energy  transfer  coupling  requires  two 
molecular fragments to exchange electrons that can carry different 
energies and spins [18] . For instance, the MLCT complex in MOFs 
can act as a prominent charge transfer mechanism (over the LMCT 
mechanism) when MOFs are modiﬁed by metalloligand-based pho- 
tosensitizers  (e.g.,  metalloporphyrin  or  dye  sensitizer)  [52] .  This 
could  be  attributed  to  alterations  in  the  semiconducting  behav- 
ior of MOFs. In this case, the absorption of photon light is stim- 
ulated by the photosensitizer, followed by the photoexcitation of 
metallated ions (or metal centers). The photoexcited electrons from 
metal centers (or metallated ions) are then migrated to the LUMO 
edge of the organic ligand via the MLCT (or MMCT) mechanism. 
For example, ligand-sensitized luminescent MOFs fabricated from

emission peaks by lanthanide (Ln)-MOFs (Förster mechanism) can 
be  detected  upon  the  excitation  of  the  organic  ligands  that  act 
as chromophores to sensitize Ln-SBUs (with small extinction co- 
eﬃcients). Phosphorescent MOF [Zn(L

known ligand-sensitized luminescent MOF [96] . A phosphorescent

Upon irradiation, the L 
1 -Ru) MOF was 
excited to the singlet 1 MLCT state (i.e. , short lifetime) because of 
the large spin-orbit coupling of Ru(II) centers. This was followed 
by the intersystem crossing the 3 MLCT triplet state (i.e. , long-lived 
ligand-centered  excited  state)  that  exhibited  stable  phosphores- 
cence with a longer lifespan up to several hundreds of nanosec- 
onds.  However,  the  3 MLCT  (from  which  energy  transfer  occurs) 
1 -Ru  ligand  was  quenched  by  doping  the  osmium  ana- 
of  the  L 
log (L 
1 -Ru) MOF [18 , 97] . The 
role  of  Os(II)  in  enhancing  the  quenching  effect  of  MOF  phos- 
phorescence was also proved by time-resolved emission analysis 
(i.e.,  a  decrease  in  the  lifetime  of  Ru(II)  excited  states  by  dop- 
1 -Ru)  MOF  with  2.6  mol%  of  Os(II)).  It  is  thus  believed 
ing  Zn(L 
that the L 
1 -Os ligand serves as the trap site for electron migration 
transfer due to the lower bandgap between the d π orbital of the 
Os(II) analog bridge and the π ∗ orbital of the polypyridine (bpy) 
ligand  [78] .  The  observed  photophysical  results  strongly  suggest 
that the site-by-site hopping energy transfer mechanism (MLCT) in 
osmium-doped Zn(L 
1 -Ru) MOF obeys the Dexter theory (e.g. , Ru- 
to-Os charge transfer; Fig. 6 (b)) [78] . For more insight on the en- 
ergy transfer mechanisms, Fig. 6 (c) illustrates the phosphorescence

In  the  case  of  multifunctional  MOF  photocatalysts  (e.g.,  MOF 
composites),  the  photosynthetic  Z-scheme  can  offer  a  potential 
pathway for the energy transfer process during photocatalysis [53] . 
In  this  context,  there  are  three  main  possible  routes  to  explain 
the charge transfer mechanism. The Z-schemes for charge trans- 
fer can possibly occur between: (i) the metal node and semicon- 
ductor  NPs  intercalated  in  MOF  composites,  (ii)  the  metal  node 
and  metal  ions  of  the  organometallic  ligand  in  MOF-based  dye 

sensitizers, and (iii) different semiconducting metal nodes in the 
same heterometal cluster of bimetallic MOFs [98-100] . To summa- 
rize, the overall photonic mechanism within MOFs involves three 
stages: (1) light absorption, (2) an energy transfer mechanism (i.e. , 
several theories  based  on  associated  energy  levels of  ligand  and 
metal), and (3) light emission processes [87] . In principle, after the 
absorption of light energy, two main mechanisms of energy trans- 
fer  were  theoretically  developed: a  dipole-dipole (Förster)  and  a 
double-electron exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Both charge trans- 
fer mechanisms are possible depending on the photonic properties 
of the metal nodes and ligand, which have the potential to signif- 
icantly inﬂuence photo-response, energy-transfer processes, emis- 
sion energy, and photocatalytic capability. 

3. Quick synthesis approaches for MOF photocatalysts and 
their shaping 

3.1. Controlled synthesis approach of MOF crystals 

The design/modulation of charge transfer pathways (via LMCT, 
LLCT, or MLCT mechanisms) in MOFs offer a facile route for im- 
proving  their  intrinsic  semiconducting  properties  and  promoting 
their practical use in UV–visible-driven photocatalysis under sun- 
light irradiation. These charge transfer mechanisms could be mod- 
ulated  by  the  selection  of  chromophoric  ligands  (with  donor- 
withdrawal  functional  groups),  active  metal  centers  (as  nodes), 
and  the  nature  of  the  guest  molecules  present  during  the  in- 
situ  growth  of  MOF  composites  [18] .  Accordingly,  various  fabri- 
cation protocols were used to modulate the crystalline nature of 
MOFs and their composites, including solvothermal (e.g., conven- 
tional heating and microwave-assisted synthesis and sonochemical 
techniques) and non-solvothermal approaches (e.g., ﬂow chemistry, 
mechanochemical, spray-drying, and electrochemical) ( Fig. 7 ). 

The solvothermal method takes place under autogenous pres- 
sure at a temperature higher than the boiling point of the reac- 
tion solvent. In contrast, the non-solvothermal methods are per- 
formed in a temperature regime lower than the boiling point of 
solvent  under  1  bar  [101 , 102] .  The  development  of  proper  syn- 
thesis conditions also implies that the growth rate of MOFs can 
be controlled to subsequently inﬂuence the coordination geome- 
try, porosity, and surface area of the resulting MOF. It is thus vi- 
tal to understand the coordination environment between organic 
linkers  and  metal  units  in  line  with  the  thermal  stability  of  or- 
ganic linkers to select the best synthetic routes for the fabrication

of desired porous structures of MOF photocatalysts without in-situ 
decomposition of the organic linkers in the reaction [103] . There- 
fore,  various  characterization  techniques  are  used  for  the  evalu- 
ation of basic properties (e.g., crystallinity, porosity, morphology, 
and optical/electronic properties) of MOFs to optimize their syn- 
thesis conditions. The most common analytical instruments used 
for MOF characterization are as follows: single-crystal or powder 
X-ray  diffraction  (XRD),  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS), 
N 
2 -adsorption/desorption  isotherms,  ﬁeld-emission  scan  electron 
microscopy  (FESEM),  high-resolution  transmission  electron  mi- 
croscopy (HR-TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman spectroscopy, photolu- 
minescence (PL) spectroscopy, UV-visible diffuse reﬂectance spec- 
troscopy  (UV–Vis  DRS),  thermogravimetric  analysis  (TGA),  sur- 
face  plasmon  resonance  (SPR),  electrochemical  impedance  spec- 
troscopy  (EIS),  photocurrent  responses,  and  inductively  coupled 
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Among these ana- 
lytical tools, spectroscopic characterization (e.g., Raman, FTIR, neu- 
tron diffraction, single-crystal XRD, and NMR) can be used to ex- 
plain  the  formation  of  structural  defects  in  MOF  crystals  [104] . 

Detailed  information  on  MOF  characteristic  tools  can  be  found 
elsewhere  [34 , 53 , 104] .  The  combination  of  these  analytical  tools 
with the quantum-chemical characterization of MOFs (e.g., using 
quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simu- 
lations) can provide more insightful data such as the speciﬁc elec- 
tronic/mechanical/reactivity features of the designed MOFs [73] . 

Several  studies  provided  insight  into  the  synthesis  and 
PSM  strategies  of  MOF-based  photocatalysts  via  in-situ/ex-situ 
solvothermal/non-solvothermal  methods  [20 , 43 , 105-108 ].  Herein, 
we offer a brief summary of the effect of synthetic parameters on 
the properties of MOF-based photocatalysts. 

(a) Aromatic  linkers  are  frequently  utilized  in  the  building  of 
MOF  photocatalysts  because  they  act  as  antennae  (chro- 
mophore  with  π -conjugation)  for  light-harvesting  during 
photocatalysis.  Upon  excitation,  they  can  donate  two  or 
more pairs of electrons to SBUs (active metal sites) through 
the coordination bonds. Alternatively, speciﬁc organic link- 
ers with additional chromospheric functionality can also be 
designed in-situ during the fabrication of MOFs from neutral 
materials (organic synthesis). This approach is referred to as

in-situ generation of organic linkers [109-111] . As such, the 
bandgaps of MOFs can be modulated and tuned by appro- 
priate selection of functional aromatic ligands. Multi-organic 
ligand functionalities (amine, carboxylate, hydroxyl, etc .) are 
also combined with MOFs to offer suitable pore sizes and to 
form composites for enhancing the activities of MOF-based 
photocatalysts for target applications [112] . 

(b) To  date,  d-block  transitions  and  f-block  lanthanide  metals 
are  widely  used  as  SBUs  for  the  synthesis  of  MOF  photo- 
catalysts. In particular, the metal-ligand coordination bond- 
ing can be reinforced by controlling the valence charge of 
metal ions, thereby improving the stability of the MOFs in 
environmental applications [113-115] . Moreover, most of the 
high charge metal ions (e.g., tri- or tetra-valent metal cen- 
ters  such  as  Fe 3 ±,  Al 3 ±,  Cr 3 ±,  Zr 4 ±,  and  Ti 4 ± along  with 
lanthanide series) are highly reactive and oxophilic with a 
photocatalytic potential [116 , 117] . Speciﬁcally, the lanthanide 
MOF  series  (Ln-MOFs)  has  recently  attracted  attention  in 
photo-electrocatalysis due to their unique luminescence fea- 
tures  (sharp  line  emissions  from  UV-visible  range  to  near 
IR, large Stokes shifts, long-lived emission, and high lumi- 
nescence quantum yield) and aﬃnity for constructing a ro- 
bust coordination framework [118] . Nevertheless, controlling 
the coordination of the organic ligands with the lanthanide 
elements  is  still  challenging  in  framework  geometries  due 
to the many coordination numbers of lanthanide (f-f transi- 
tions) in reference to d-d transition metals [103 , 119] . In one 

fascinating  route  for  tailoring  MOF  designs,  the  synthesis 
of mixed-metal (d-f systems) MOFs was developed to pro- 
mote a visible-light-driven MOF photocatalyst [120 , 121] . The 
pre-synthesis of polynuclear SBU complexes (polyoxometa- 
lates)  can  also  be  used  as  an  alternative  strategy  to  con- 
trol  the  design  of  topological  and  electronic  properties  of 
Ln-MOF photocatalysts instead of using metal salt precursors 
[122 , 123] . POMs (metal-oxygen clusters) also offer great po- 
tential for improving the environmental stability of MOF cat- 
alysts (POM-based MOFs) and promoting their visible-driven 
photocatalysis in environmental applications. 

(c) The nature of solvent polarity can greatly inﬂuence the con- 
nectivity  between  the  metal  and  ligand  due  to  the  pro- 
tolysis  of  the  organic  linker  [103] .  Thus,  the  types  of  sol- 
vents determine the structural properties of the framework 
of MOF photocatalysts (e.g., dimensionality, surface area, and 
porosity), which subsequently can affect photocatalytic per- 
formance,  as  discussed  later  in  Section  5 .  Systematic  in- 
vestigations  into  the  impact  of  solvent  on  the  MIL  series 
showed that the reaction of Fe(III) salt with aminated lig- 
2 )  in  acetonitrile  or  methanol  can  lead  to 
and  (H

the production of Fe-MIL-88B-NH 
wise, Fe-MIL-88B-NH 
2 can also be fabricated through a hy- 
drothermal  route  in  a  water  solution.  However,  in  most 
cases,  such  a  reaction  led  to  the  construction  of  a  Fe- 
2 geometry [124 , 125] . The fabrication of Fe-MIL- 
MIL-53-NH 
2 was achieved with dimethylformamide (DMF) sol-

[103] .  Thus,  it  suggested  that  metal  ions  surrounding  the  POM 
were  templated  before  coordinating  with  the  corresponding  or- 
ganic  ligands,  and  thus  POMs  resided  in  the  cages  within  the 
frameworks. 

In  general,  three  major  roles  have  been  reported  for  the  use 
of organic solvents containing functional moieties (e.g. , DMF, DEF, 
or  DMSO),  as  follows:  (1)  a  solvent  for  MOF  precursors  and  a 
controllable  agent  affecting  the  basicity  of  the  synthesis  media 
that deprotonates the organic linker and starts coordination with 
metal ions, (2) an axial ligand (space-ﬁlling molecules) to coordi- 
nate with the SBUs (e.g., space-ﬁlling), and, in some cases, (3) a 
structure-directing agent (SDA) [106] . In fact, SDAs act as counter- 
ions (such as amines and ammonium ions, surfactants, or metal 
salts)  for  charge  balance  or  templates  of  a  host-guest  structure 
[103 , 130] .  For  example,  the  effects  of  SDA-based  organic  amines 
(such as 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidine (HPP), 
2 DACH)) on the topol- 
imidazole (Him), and diaminocyclohexane (H 
ogy of MOFs were tested during the synthesis of anionic zeolite- 
like MOFs (ZMOF). The three SDA species (HPP, Him, and H 
2 DACH) 
acted  as  charge-balancing  templates  and  reacted  with  indium 
(In(III))  ions  and  organic  bridges  (4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic  acid 
3 ImDC)) to yield three different microcrystalline frameworks, in- 
(H 
cluding  rho -ZMOF,  sod -ZMOF,  and  med -ZMOF,  respectively  [131] . 
Speciﬁcally,  sod -ZMOF  and  rho -ZMOF  possessed  larger  volumes, 
which  were  eight  times  higher  than  their  analogs  ( med -ZMOF) 
( Fig. 8 ). Inorganic SDA templates (other than solvent) such as Keg- 
gin  POM  anions  or  alkaline  metal  ions  have  also  been  reported 

Modulators play four different roles to tailor the physicochem- 
ical properties of MOFs (crystallinity and purity) during the con- 
trolled synthesis procedure as follows: 

(1) They  serve  as  capping  agents  that  slow  down  the  nucle- 
ation/growth rate and thus control the size and the shape 
of crystalline MOFs with non-aggregated crystals [134] . 
(2) They  are  deprotonating  agents  for  linking  moieties  (or- 
ganic/inorganic  molecules),  thereby  leading  to  accelerated 
synthesis  reaction  rates  and  crystallization  behavior  [135] . 
2 O mixture solvent, water acts as 
For example, in a DMF/H 
an oxygen supplier to accelerate metal salt (e.g., ZrCl 
4 ) hy- 
drolysis  and  induce  the  formation  of  SBUs  that  allow  nu- 
cleation and growth of MOF (Zr-MOF) crystals [136] . A mix- 
ture of organic solvents or water/organic solvents of com- 
parable polarity have been reported as the most commonly 
used medium to control the porosity of MOFs. 

(3) Most  modulators  used  in  the  synthesis  reaction  become 
a  part  of  the  MOF,  resulting  in  geometrical  structural  de- 
fects  with  incomplete  assemblies.  In  such  circumstances, 
the modulators form soluble discrete clusters of modulator- 
capped metal that allowed reversible exchange with the di- 
topic organic linker for self-assembly of 3D MOF structures 
[137] .

(4) A secondary reagent provided new opportunities for addi- 
tional functional sites in MOF frameworks to facilitate chem- 
ical interactions during their applications [138] . 

Practically, most SDA/space-ﬁlling molecules have a strong in- 
teraction  with  SBUs,  and  thus  they  are  often  hard  to  exchange, 
causing structural collapse/defects upon removal from the frame- 
work cages [139 , 140] . Several crystalline defects were also recog- 
nized and classiﬁed based on the effect of solvent systems, metal 
center precursors, and type and amount of modulators on the con- 
trol modulated reactions of MOFs [141 , 142] . To avoid such draw- 
backs, ionothermal synthesis has recently been developed to con- 
trol the topology and functionality of MOFs [143] . The approach 
involves  the  use  of  deep  eutectic  solvents  (DESs:  a  mixture  of 
lower  melting  point  compounds  than  those  of  its  constituents) 
[143]  and  ionic  liquids  (ILs:  molten  salts  in  liquid  form  at  tem- 
perature  ≤ 100  °C)  [144]  for  MOF  synthesis  at  low  temperature 
(20 °C). In such modulated designs, DESs and ILs are suitable sol- 
vents with unusual properties (no detectable vapor pressures) that 
allow for the dissolution of the precursors needed for the synthe- 
sis of MOFs [145] . During the procedure, ILs and DESs act as both 
SDA agents and solvents for controlled design MOFs in a manner 
like the solvothermal process in a Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel auto- 
clave reactor. Only in rare cases were the ILs or DES species (neu- 
tral/ionized, mostly cationic) retained as coordinated species in the 
channels of MOFs after synthesis. The removal of these coordinated 
species (ILs or DES) should impart crystallinity and porosity to the 
MOF frameworks (process disadvantages) [144] . 

Note  that  defects  in  MOF  structures  (i.e.,  imperfections  in 
the  MOF  crystal  lattice)  are  inadvertently  formed  by  the  elim- 
ination  of  parts  of  metal  nodes  or  organic  linkers  (i.e.,  coordi- 
nation  bond  breaking  and  reforming)  during  the  synthesis  pro- 
cesses  (See  Fig.  7 ).  Such  defects  in  MOF  structures  can  indicate 
required changes to ideal synthetic parameters via (i) changes in 
synthetic temperature or reaction time, (ii) alterations of ligand: 
metal stoichiometric ratios (e.g., excess of ligand over metal mo- 
lar ratios) in solution [146-148] , and/or (iii) coordination of metal 
nodes  with  other  SDA  or  organic  modulator  molecules  used  in 
the  solution  (instead  of  the  organic  ligand).  In  this  case,  it  was 
reported  that  the  defect  structures  are  commonly  accompanied 
by electron localization and distortion in MOF crystal lattices and 
changes in their associated pore structures [104] . Hence, defect en- 
gineering  in  MOF  photocatalysts  could  play  a  critical  role  in  al- 
ternating MOF properties, such as the bandgap, electronic struc- 
tures,  and  photocatalytic  performance  [149] .  Interestingly,  recent 
research  veriﬁed  the  importance  of  structural  defects  in  the  en- 
hanced (photo)catalytic performance of MOFs by showing that they 
create coordinatively unsaturated sites around the metal sites that 
should ideally be fully saturated [37] . These newly introduced un- 
saturated  sites  allowed  extra  routes  for  the  migration  of  photo- 
generated charge carriers, facilitating e −/ h ± pairs separation (long 
lifetime) and photocatalytic activities of MOFs [150 , 151] . For exam- 
ple, Zr-based MOFs (e.g., UiO-66) have unfavorable photocatalytic 
activities due to the full saturation of metal sites, low conductiv- 
ity, and large bandgap (E g ≈ 4.0 eV: poor light absorption). Given 
the  large  number  of  possible  defect  structures  in  UiO-66  (up  to 
456 atoms/unit cell), the geometry of the coordinatively saturated 
Zr-metal clusters (octahedral Zr 
4 nodes) can be greatly in- 
6 O 
ﬂuenced by missing linker defects. This missing linker defect can 
offer an effective route for node functionalization through metal 
substitution [152] . Experimental and DFT calculations showed that 
the  bandgap  of  UiO-66  can  be  remarkably  reduced  to  1.62  eV 
by  substitution  of  Zr  metal  site  with  Ti  ions  in  the  crystal  lat- 
tice (e.g., the formation of heterometal-doped UiO-66(Zr/Ti)) [153] . 
Moreover, it was assumed that the defective structure formed dur- 
ing substitution (missed coordination bonds between metal cen- 

4 (OH) 

ters  and  BDC  ligands)  could  lower  the  energy  of  unoccupied  d - 
orbitals of Zr atoms due to the change (distortion) in the coordina- 
tion environment. Such structural defects were found to improve 
the visible-light absorption and charge transfer likelihood (LMCT 
and  Z-scheme).  In  this  case,  the  BDC  ligands  acted  as  antennae 
to absorb photons, then the excited electrons transferred to het- 
erometal oxo-clusters (LMCT), leaving positive holes in the BDC lig- 
and. The incorporated Ti in the heterometal-doped UiO-66(Zr/Ti) 
acted  as  trapping  sites  for  photogenerated  electrons  upon  irra- 
diation  (e.g.,  Z-scheme  charge  migration in  the  oxo-bridged  het- 
ero clusters from Ti 3 ±–O–Zr 4 ±to Ti 4 ±–O–Zr 3 ±). Hence, the trapped 
electrons in the oxo-bridged clusters can substantially increase the 
lifetime of electron-holes pairs, leading to improved photocatalytic 
activities (relative to pristine UiO-66 with octahedral Zr 
4 (OH) 
4 
nodes) [151 , 152] . 

6 O 

Therefore, we concluded that the synthesis conditions can have 
a  dramatic  impact  on  the  physicochemical  properties  (i.e.,  me- 
chanical  and  electronic  structures)  of  MOFs  and  their  associated 
photocatalytic activities. As such, it is essential to understand the 
interactions between the major synthesis variables and the MOF 
properties  to  achieve  the  most  suitable  synthetic  methods  that 
provide  “ideal” MOF  crystals.  To  this  end,  defect  engineering  in 
MOF structures (e.g., missed node or missed ligand, besides ligand 
functionalization and node metal substitution) can provide a new 
tunable pathway for tuning electronic/photonic features of MOFs 
for high-end photocatalytic purposes. However, it should be noted 
that excessively disordered structural defects can retard the charge 
separation  eﬃciency  (i.e.,  increase  charge  recombination  and  re- 
duce photoactivity). In some cases, the structural defects can be- 
have as scattering centers, causing localized band-tail states by dis- 
torting  (breaking)  electronic  structures  and  reducing  charge  mo- 
bility in the MOF-like semiconductor crystal lattice [154 , 155] . As 
such, these excessive defects are unfavorable imperfections in MOF 
photocatalysts because they deteriorate the photocatalytic perfor- 
mance [149] . Hence, the effect of synthetic conditions on the de- 
fective structures of MOF and their associated photocatalysis must 
be considered in future studies in both theoretical computational 
and experimental analyses. These data should be used to develop 
a modulator-strategy to induce tuned defect-formation in MOF lat- 
tices with high mechanical stability and tailorable photocatalytic 
behaviors for practical applications. 

3.2. Shape engineering for MOF catalytic activity 

Shape engineering of MOFs can be done either by direct (in- 
situ)  or  indirect  (PSM)  pathways  ( Table  2 ).  In  the  case  of  direct 
engineering, MOFs are shaped as thin ﬁlms or hollow superstruc- 
tures during the fabrication process, whereas indirect PSM is used 
to enhance the mechanical and chemical stabilities and resistances 
in their applications [9] . However, there are technical challenges 
associated with maintaining the intrinsic functionalities and fea- 
tures  (e.g.,  crystallinity,  functionality,  and  porosity)  when  shap- 
ing  MOFs  to  improve  the  optical  properties  along  with  physico- 
chemical/thermal stabilities for speciﬁc applications [156] . For in- 
stance, HKUST-1 nanoparticles immobilized on mesoporous silica 
were fabricated to reduce pressure drop while enhancing catalytic 
conversion in a continuous ﬂow system [157] . Yolk-shell structures 
of noble-metal NP encapsulated MOF hosts (Pt NPs@NH 
2 -MIL-125 
[158] and Pd NPs@ZIF-8 [159] , ( Fig. 9 )) have been developed to im- 
prove catalytic performances in H 
2 generation and gas-phase het- 
erogeneous catalysis. In this case, the hosted MOF framework acted 
as a co-catalyst to restrict the agglomeration and leaching of Pd/Pt 
NPs, whereas the Pt/Pd NPs served as the active sites to accelerate 
charge transfer and to enhance the catalytic activity. 

Several techniques are currently used for encapsulation of metal 
NPs  in  MOFs,  including  vapor  deposition,  solid  grinding,  liquid

faces.  In  addition,  oil  drop  granulation  of  aerogel  monolith  Zr- 
MOF  (UiO-66)  spheres  (600  μm  diameter)  showed  good  perfor- 
mance for gas phase adsorption/catalytic reactions. Enhanced per- 
formance over Zr-MOF monoliths can be accounted for by the im- 
proved  mass  transfer  in  mesoporous  (15–24  nm)  aerogel  mono- 
liths as compared with bulk UiO-66 powder (0.47 nm pore size) 
[165] .  In  addition,  the  synthesis  of  a  cup-shaped  MOF  compos-

ite  (HKUST-1@Fe 
liquid-phase  oxidation  of  C-H  hydrocarbon  (76%  conversion  and 
93%  selectivity)  with  high  stability  up  to  3  cycles  due  to  hier- 
archically  porous  structures  with  increased  reaction  rates  [166] . 
A  low-density  MOF  foam  ( ≤ 0.1  g  cm −3 )  also  provided  high 
inlet  ﬂow  permeability  with  a  low-pressure  drop  ( ≤ 20  Pa  at 
500 mL min −1 ) during the oxidation process, which may be suit- 
able for industrial applications. Furthermore, MOF composite thin 
ﬁlms  (e.g.,  Au@UiO-66  composite)  acted  as  both  heterogeneous 
catalysts and separation membrane ﬁlters during the continuous- 
ﬂow  process  [167] .  In  the  latter  research,  Au@UiO-66  compos- 
ite  thin  ﬁlms  were  prepared  by  the  post-synthesis  polymeriza- 
tion  of  methacrylamide-decorated  UiO-66-NH 
2  in  the  presence 
of  thiol-polysiloxane  oligomers.  This  composite  functioned  as  a 
highly  eﬃcient  catalytic  membrane  reactor  for  the  C-C  coupling 
reaction ( ≥ 97% yield up to 5 cycles) [167] .

impregnation,  and  emulsion-based  interfacial  synthesis  ( Table  2 ) 
[157 , 160-164 ]. Yolk-shell structures and spray drying were also ap- 
plied  recently  as  an  effective  means  to  overcome  manufacturing 
limitations (e.g., surface homogeneity of encapsulated NPs active 
sites  in  MOFs,  tunable  pore  blocking,  and  MOFs  stability)  [156] .

4. Strategies for the modulation of pristine MOFs to increase 
photocatalytic activities 

In  light  of  the  unique  optical/electronic  structures  of  MOFs 
( Section 2 ), many modiﬁcation approaches (in-situ functionaliza- 
tion and post-modiﬁcation) have been proposed and tested to im- 
prove  their  photocatalytic  performance  towards  various  applica- 
tions (See Section 5 ). Notably, the high photocatalytic activity of 
MOF photocatalysts can be accounted for by ﬁve key factors: (1) 
improved  photon  harvesting,  (2)  prolonged  lifetime  of  the  sepa- 
rated e −/ h ± pairs, (3) accelerated photo-generated charge transfer 
mechanism, (4) the existence of highly reactive catalytic sites (e.g. , 
semiconducting nodes or co-catalyst like Pt), and (5) the beneﬁcial 
surface properties of MOF frameworks (e.g., BET area, porosity, and 
pore volume). 

Enormous  research  efforts  have  been  made  to  increase  the 
photocatalytic  activity  of  MOFs  through  various  options  includ- 
ing: (1) ﬁne-tuning of porous MOFs and their surface-to-pore vol- 
ume ratios, (2) photosensitization of ligands, (3) improving metal- 
energetic sites, and (4) PSM of pristine MOFs (i.e. , ligand modiﬁ- 
cation, metal and semiconductor doping, and functionalization of 
metal  sites)  as  shown  in  Fig.  10  [17 , 168] .  In  an  effort  to  practi- 
cally implement such options, polycrystalline MOF powders have 
also  been  molded  in  different  shapes  such  as  pellets,  granules, 
foams, thin ﬁlms, paper sheets, ﬂuids, and hollow superstructures 
( Fig. 11 ) [156] . Molding of MOF crystalline powders to other forms 
(e.g.,  granules  or  monolithic  honeycomb  shapes)  has  been  pur- 
sued to reduce the diﬃculties involved in photocatalytic operations 

such  as  agglomeration,  channeling,  clogging,  and  catalyst  leach- 
ing out/ﬂushing. As such, the strategies for modifying MOF shapes 
from powder into some other form are advantageous as both the 
mass and energy transfer can help enhance the catalytic capabil- 
ities in terms of the product yield during the applications [156] . 
Nonetheless, as MOFs are structurally ﬂexible, their expansion and 
contraction (breathing effect) capability should be highly contin- 
gent on their stability against external stimuli (e.g., temperature, 
humidity,  pressure,  and  light).  The  structural  ﬂexibility  also  de- 
pends upon organic linkers, solvent molecules, pore geometry, and 
the type of secondary building units [168] . Therefore, a fundamen- 
tal understanding of MOF breathing effects in terms of their de- 
sign and structure tunability is vital for determining the catalytic 
performance  of  MOFs  [17 , 169-174 ].  In  parallel  with  attempts  to 
achieve new laboratory-scale MOF-based photocatalysts, it is de- 
sirable to adequately address the feasibility of MOF-based photo- 
catalysts for industrial-scale applications. 

4.1. Functionalization of organic linkers/metal centers 

The nature of the organic linker ( Fig. 12 ) has a profound effect 
on the MOF framework stability, light-harvesting ability, and cat- 
alytic site performance via controlling the LMCT mechanism [85] . 
In this case, proper adjustment of the bandgap levels of metal cen- 
ters (the primary catalytic sites) in the MOF through cation substi- 
tution is of great importance to promoting the LMCT mechanism 
during photocatalysis [175 , 176] .

2 -BDC and X-BDC (X = Br, F, 
halogenated Zr-MOFs with mixed NH 
and Cl) exhibited higher photocatalytic performance (TOF = 290 
to  410  μmol  min −1  g −1 )  than  that  of  NH 
2 -UiO-66  with  mixed 
2 -BDC/H-BDC ligands (TOF = 140 μmol min −1 g −1 ) under vis- 
NH 
ible  irradiation  (40 0–70 0  nm)  and  80  °C  for  24  h.  In  particular, 
the as-prepared NH

tocatalytic oxidation of 0.25 mmol benzyl alcohol (53.9% conver- 
2 -UiO-66-H ( ≤ 18.4% conversion) [182] . The 
sion) in reference to NH 
enhanced  performance  of  NH 
2 -UiO-66-F 
was ascribed to the presence of halogenated BDC ligands, which 
are highly electron-withdrawing. These groups preferentially inter- 
acted with reactants to stabilize intermediate components and de- 
crease the rate of photogenerated charge recombination (prolong- 
ing  the  lifetime  of  Zr 3 ± catalytic  sites)  [176] .  These  results  con- 
ﬁrmed the effectiveness of bi-substituted linkers in the enhance- 
ment of the optical and electronic properties of MOF photocata- 
lysts during photocatalysis applications [17 , 85] .

Various ligand functionalized groups (e.g. , CH 

2 , OH, 
Br,  Cl,  and  SH)  have  been  devised  and  tested  in  an  effort  to 
shift  the  photon  absorption  from  the  UV  to  the  visible  region 
[85 , 177] . In particular, amine functional (electron-donating) groups 
have  been  broadly  employed  due  to  their  interactions  with  π ∗- 
orbitals of the ligand benzene ring [17] . Such interactions increase 
electron density around the antibonding orbitals (formation of sp 2 
hybridization)  in  the  aromatic  carbon  ring  for  enhanced  visible 
photon  absorption.  DFT  analysis  also  suggests  that  the  addition 
of amine functionality to the organic ligand is an effective means 
of bandgap modulation relative to nitro-functionalized MOFs [e.g., 
2 (E g = 2.93 eV)  ≤ UiO- 
UiO-66-NH 
66 (E g = 4.1 eV)] [178] . This phenomenon can be accounted for by 
2 with unsaturated electrons in the O-N-O group, 
the presence of N 
which led to the formation of a non-bonding oxygen state as the 
dominant  top  valence  band  near  the  metal  cluster  (Zr-O).  Like- 
wise, the electronic conﬁguration of MIL-125(Ti) (3.54 eV/350 nm) 
yielded a reduced bandgap after increasing the number of amine 
groups  on  the  BDC  ligand  (e.g.,  NH 
2 -BDC  (2.42  eV/550  nm)  and 
BDC-(NH 

2 (E g = 2.75 eV)  ≤ UiO-66-NO 

2 (1.28 eV/950 nm)) [179 , 180] .

Recently, a series of isoreticular NH 

2 -MIL-125(Ti) was developed 
by hybridizing aminated terephthalic ligands with alkyl chains (R) 
of varying length (from short-chain methyl (C1) to heptyl (C7)) and 
connectivity (normal and isomer alkyl chain) ( Fig. 13 ) [181] . The 
reported data of all the prepared R-NH-MIL-125(Ti) MOF deriva- 
tives showed a lower bandgap (E g = 2.46 to 2.29 eV; λ > 530 nm) 
2 -MIL-125  (E g  =  2.56  eV;  λ 390–
than  that  of  the  pristine  NH 
530  nm).  This  is  due  to  the  presence  of  alkyl  donor  groups, 
which increased electron density and destabilized the HOMO va- 
lence band of the aminated terephthalate ligand. Among the mem- 
bers of the series, cyclic (cyclohexyl and cyclopentyl) substituted 
MOFs exhibited the lowest bandgap energy (E g  = 2.30–2.29 eV), 
longer-lived excited states of photogenerated charges ( τ = 68.9 to 
2 -MIL- 
91.35 ns), and high QE values of 1.5 to 1.8% (relative to NH 
125: QE of 0.31%) during the photocatalytic reduction of CO 
2 un- 
der visible irradiation. These observations indicated that amine (or 
other  electron-donating  groups)  functionalities  acted  as  an  aux- 
ochromic group to improve the visible-light harvesting based on 
the LMCT mechanism via conjugated π electron transitions. 

A  series  of  mixed-linker  Zr-MOFs  (UiO-66)  was  also  synthe- 
2 -BDC (primary ligand) and X-BDC (X = H, Br, F, 
sized using NH 
and  Cl:  as  a  secondary  ligand)  to  improve  photocatalytic  oxida- 
tion  of  alcohols  to  aldehydes  under  visible  irradiation  [182] .  All

The cation substitution of the MOF metal centers can also offer 
another strategy to enhance photocatalytic capability (or semicon- 
ducting properties) under visible irradiation by the construction of 
oxo-bridged hetero-metallic active sites within the framework. This 
process  initiates  a  metal-to-metal  charge  transfer  (MMCT)  effect 
[85] . Electron spin resonance (ESR) and DFT analyses showed that 
Ti-substituents in UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-NH 
2 [1(Zr/Ti)] can serve as a medi- 
ator (electron acceptor) to stimulate the interfacial charge transfer 
from BDC-NH 
4 ] 
via the ligand-to-Ti 3 ± (electron trapping)-O-to-Zr 4 ± bridge ( Fig. 14 ) 
[183 , 184] . The formation of a hetero-metallic 1(Zr/Ti) structure by a 
post-synthetic exchange (PSE) can also enhance light absorption up 
to 700 nm, whereas the metal-to-metal electron transition leads 
to  an  extension  in  the  lifetime  of  photogenerated  charges  (time 
window up to 200 μs) [185] . It was further conﬁrmed that substi- 
tuting diamine ligand on the modiﬁed UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-NH 
2 ( Fig. 15 ) 
also enhances the photon absorption capacity (up to 748 nm with 
E g = 1.66 eV) and charge transfer mechanism during photoreduc- 
2 into HCOOH (TOF 1.04 h −1 ) under UV-visible irradia- 
tion of CO 
tion [153 , 186] . Likewise, Ni was also substituted as a metal cen- 
ter in ZIF-8 using a mechanochemical method. Interestingly, ZIF- 
8 (Ni) showed a topology similar to Ni partially substituted ZnN 
4 
and exhibited better performance toward MB decomposition un- 
der  visible  light  [187] .  Additionally,  polyoxometalates  (POMs)  as 
metal-oxide clusters were tested to evaluate the photocatalytic ac- 
tivity of MOFs [120] . Nonetheless, two drawbacks were found to 
impede  the  practical  implementation  of  POMs  as  photocatalyst: 
(i) the high solubility of POMs and (ii) low absorption eﬃciency 
of visible light. In these contexts, the hybridization of POMs with 
lanthanide  (Ln(III))-ligand  entities  was  suggested  as  an  alternate 
model to overcome such limitations while enhancing the optical 
properties  arising  from  d/f-block  metal  ion-modiﬁed  POMs.  The 
Ln(III) ions could act as electron traps under irradiation, thereby 
decreasing  the  recombination  rate  of  photo-excited  e −/ h ± pairs 
with improved QE in photocatalysis [17 , 120] . 

4.2. Photosensitization 

Photosensitized  MOFs  have  gained  considerable  attention  be- 
cause they can offer an effective means of enhancing visible light 
sensitivity [17] . One representative method is to incorporate dye- 
like  sensitizer  molecules  (porphyrin-like  pigments  and  organic 
dyes) into MOFs. For example, the photoactivity of UV-driven UiO- 
66  exhibited  improved  performance  in  photoactive  visible  light- 
2 ( ≈33.9 μmol g −1 h −1 at λ ≥ 420 nm) 
mediated production of H 
by  incorporation  of  7.4  mg  g −1  Rhodamine  B  (RhB)  dye  [188] . 
The  deposition  of  1  wt.%  Pt  NPs  onto  RhB/UiO-66  further  im-

radiation [188] . The enhanced H 
2 evolution over RhB/UiO-66 was 
ascribed  to  the  fast  transfer  of  the  photo-excited  electrons  from 
RhB (RhB ±) dye ( e −donor) to the LUMO of UiO-66 and then to Pt 
NPs (active sites). In this case, the UiO-66 served as a co-catalyst 
to prolong the lifetime of the excited state via partial separation of 
e −/ h ± in RhB ±, thus promoting the catalytic performance. Likewise, 
low-cost dye-sensitized Pt@UiO-66 with Erythrosin B (ErB) showed 

visible-light-driven photocatalysis during H 
2 formation [189] . UiO- 
2 sensitized by naphthol, aniline, and diphenylaniline via the 
66-NH 
diazo coupling process is also an effective option for the enhanced 
destruction  of  MB  under  visible  irradiation  [190] .  Moreover,  the 
2 -MIL-125(Ti) was improved by 
photon adsorption capability of NH 
functionalizing the BDC-NH 
2 linker with diazonium salt and then 
reacting with diethylaniline (a nucleophilic species) to mimic MR

mance of ZIF-67@[Ru(bpy) 
2 O can be ascribed to the Stokes 
3 ] 2 ± complex. In fact, the [Ru 
shifts of the luminescent [Ru (bpy) 
3 ] 2 ± complex  was  readily  excited  at  450  nm  (quantum  ef- 
(bpy) 
ﬁciency  (QE)  of  4.2%).  DFT  calculations  also  revealed  that  the 
3 ] 2 ± complex 
photogenerated electrons from the excited [Ru (bpy) 
were transferred to the Zr-MOF via LMCT to facilitate the photo- 
2 [87] . The photocatalytic performance of 
reduction of adsorbed CO 
3  photosen- 
ZIF-67 was also further enhanced by adopting a RuN 
sitizer, which facilitated the production of H 
2  (~86.9%) due to its 
rapid photon transfer rate from RuN 
3 to ZIF-67 [194] . Accordingly, 
three mechanistic pathways can be recommended for photosensi- 
tized MOF catalysts: (i) visible-light absorption by photosensitizers 
(creation of excited states), (ii) fast migration of photo-generation 
of e −/ h ± pairs to the reactive centers, and (iii) the improved redox 
half-reactions at the catalytic centers [18] . 

4.3. Metal ion doping 

2 ] n 

1-x Cux(2-mim) 

The decoration of MOFs by metal ions can be used as an ef- 
fective  tool  to  reinforce  their  semiconducting  properties  by  im- 
proving the photogenic e −/ h ± separation, which can enhance pho- 
tocatalytic  activities  [17 , 168 , 195] .  For  example,  Cu(II)-doped  ZIF- 
67 photocatalyst (E g  = 1.95 eV) was synthesized to enhance the 
photodegradation  of  methyl  orange  (MO)  dye  (100%  removal  in 
25  min)  compared  to  pristine  ZIF-67  (20%  removal)  under  visi- 
ble  irradiation  [196] .  In  this  case,  the  existence  of  Cu(I)  in  the 
solvothermal process led to the formation of a defect in the tetra- 
−xn : mim = 2- 
hedral coordination geometry [[Co 
methylimidazole] that played a vital role in enhancing photocat- 
alytic performance. This is due to the replacement of Co(II) sites 
by  Cu(I)  within  Cu/ZIF-67,  as  conﬁrmed  by  EPR  and  XPS  analy- 
ses. Nonetheless, these authors did not offer a complete picture of 
how the topology and bandgap remained similar even after dop- 
ing. Immobilization of Ce and Pd ions into MIL-101 was also per- 
2 formation 
formed through the hydrothermal process to enhance H 
3  ± 2H 
from  ammonia  borane  (0.2  mmol)  hydrolysis  [H

2

2 of 495 μmol h −1 ) was 
catalytic performance of Pd/CeMIL-101 (H 
2.3 times higher than that of Pd-MIL-101 due to the active role 
of Ce and Pd NPs in promoting the transportation of charge carri- 
ers and reduced recombination rate of e −/ h + pairs. Based on such 
observations, Ce  ions may play an important role as a mediator 
(Ce 4 + /Ce 3 + ) for the fast transfer of electrons from MIL-101 to the 
electron-rich sites of Pd NPs. 

The design of bimetallic MOFs with targeted bandgap structures 
was  also  recommended  to  increase  photocatalytic  performance. 
For  example,  visible-light-driven bimetallic  Co/Zn-ZIF  (polyhedral 
shape)  was  prepared  for  improved  photocatalytic  degradation  of 
Indigo Carmine dye using the rapid metal-metal charge transfer via 
the d -d transition from Zn(II) to Co(II) active metal centers [198] . 
Also,  partial  substitution  of  MIL-101(Cr)  with  Al(III)  and  Fe(III) 
through the transmetallation process led to blue-shifts in the op- 
tical  response  of  MIL-101(Cr)  from  592  to  602  nm  as  compared 
to Fe(III) substitution (blue-shifts to 585 nm) [199] . This observa- 
tion indicated that the differences in the electronic conﬁgurations 
of Al 3 ± (p- group metal) and Fe 3 ± (occupied d-orbital) inﬂuence 
the d -d transition states of the Cr(III)-BDC coordination framework. 
Thus, it was suggested that the occupied d-orbitals of the octahe- 
dral Fe(III) site inﬂuenced the d -d transitions of the Cr(III) sites. 
Moreover, Fe(III) was incorporated into PCN-224 (Fe@PCN-224) to 
serve as a Fenton reagent for facile oxidation of isopropanol con- 
taminant with an 8.9-fold enhancement over PCN-224 [200] . Simi- 
larly, partial substitution of Fe(III) onto Cr-MIL-101 (Fe-Cr-MIL-101) 
through  the  hydrothermal  process  was  used  to  eﬃciently  treat 
100 mg L −1  reactive dye RR195 through Fenton-like degradation 
2 with recyclability of up to 
(100% removal) in the presence of H

dye-like moieties in the NH 
2 -MIL-125(Ti) MOF scaffold [75] . Un- 
der visible irradiation, MR-MIL-125(Ti) ( Fig. 16 ) showed enhanced 
photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde due to 
the extended π -conjugation system in aromatic ligands, which in- 
creased photon-absorption intensity up to 700 nm [17] . Neverthe- 
less, the direct addition of organic dyes into MOFs is undesirable, 
possibly due to low reusability. Therefore, further research effort s 
on photosensitized dyes/MOFs should be devoted to the enhanced 
stability of dye sensitizers. 

Recently, transition metal-organic sensitizers of d 6 , d 8 , and d 10 
metal complexes have been used to improve the photon-sorption 
ability and to overcome the previously mentioned instabilities of 
organic-based  dye/MOFs  [87] .  In  a  speciﬁc  study,  a  0.53  mM  Pt 
complex  with  2,2 (cid:8) -bipyridine  (Pt-bpy)  was  immobilized  onto  Al- 
2  formation  under  visible  irra- 
MOF-253  by  PSM  to  improve  H 
diation  [191] .  Indeed,  the  experimental  results  proved  that  the 
Al-MOF-253/Pt  complex  behaved  like  a  visible-light-driven  cata- 
2  generation  (QE  1.63%  at  440  nm)  compared  to  MOF- 
lyst  in  H 
2  detected,  only  UV-driven catalysis at 380 nm).  Also, 
253 (no H 
2 production rate by Al-MOF-253/Pt (85 μmol h −1 ) was 4.7 
the H 
2  complex (bpydc = 5,5 (cid:8) - 
times faster than that of a Pt(bpydc)Cl 
dicarboxylate-2,2 (cid:8) -bipyridine)  [191] .  The  enhanced  generation  of 
H 
2  was accounted for by the enhanced photon-sorption capabil- 
ity (up to 650 nm) in association with charge transfer transitions 
from excited MOF-253-to-bpy ( π ∗)-to-Pt 2 ±. Thus, two key events 
were  identiﬁed  to  explain  the  observations:  (1)  the  build-up  of 
partially  separated  Pt-Pt  interactions  with  higher  electron  trans- 
fer eﬃciency and (2) the reduced deformation rate of the incor- 
2 monomer complex in MOFs-253/Pt. Similarly, a 
porated Pt(bpy)Cl 
2 : tpy = bis(4-(4-carboxyphenyl)-terpyridine) 
Ru-complex (Ru(tpy) 
was incorporated as a bridging ligand with a HOMO level lower 
2  in  a  Ti-MOF  [Ti-MOF-Ru(tpy) 
than  that  of  BDC-NH 
2 ]  to  en- 
2  generation  [192] .  Under  visible  irradia- 
hance  visible-driven  H

tion,  Ti-MOF-Ru(tpy)

equacy of inorganic semiconductors in dye photosensitization rela- 
tive to the MOF platform. In another report, ZIF-67 sensitized by

3 runs [201] . The optical characteristics of UiO-66 (3.75 eV) were 
also improved by incorporating titanium (Ti/UiO-66) via cation ex- 
change [186] . Upon irradiation, Ti(IV) ions facilitated light absorp- 
tion  and  photon  transfer  for  the  Zr(IV)  node  while  serving  as  a 
trapping site for photo-induced charges (increase e −/ h ± lifetime) 
from photo-excited BDC to ZrAO oxo-clusters. In addition, the opti- 
cal properties of Cd-MOF (E g = 3.6 eV) were optimized through the 
intercalation of SBU (Cd nodes) with various metal ions (e.g., Zn(II), 
Ag(I), and Fe(III)) based on the ion exchange method [202] . Opti- 
cal analyses showed that the encapsulation of Cd-MOF with Fe(III) 
ions (Fe/Cd-MOF) yielded the narrowest bandgap with a visible- 
driven response (E g = 2.0 eV). In contrast, Ag/Cd-MOF and Zn/Cd- 
MOF showed no signiﬁcant change in terms of UV-driven response 
(E g = 3.5 and 3.4 eV, respectively). The improved optical bandgap 
of Fe/Cd-MOFs was explained by the improved electron movement 
of Fe(III) in the presence of stable d 10  Cd SBU in the framework 
center (resistance for redox process). 

4.4. Encapsulation with functional guest molecules 

Enormous effort s were made to encapsulate MOFs with func- 
tional guest NPs (electrocatalysts, noble metal NPs, semiconduct- 
ing metal/metal-oxide NPs (MNPs), and metal-free semiconductors) 
to  form guest@MOF  composites  using core/shell or  surface  ﬁlms 
[9 , 13 , 17] . The construction of guest@MOF composites as photocat- 
alysts involves three technical goals: (1) faster light-absorption by 
modulating the photo-responsive structure, (2) enhanced separa- 
tion of photogenerated charge ( e −/ h ±) carriers and accumulation 
of electrons by controlling redox-active metallic nodes, and (3) se- 
lection of appropriate MOF topologies with suﬃcient cavities for 
the encapsulation of guest NPs to yield productive turnover [86] . 
Through the construction of hierarchical MOF composite structures, 
the functionalized guest NPs can act as a co-catalyst to improve 
visible photon-absorption and/or increase active sites to enhance 
e −/ h ± separation rate during photocatalysis.

the microporous cavity of NH 
2 -MIL-125 due to its large molecu- 
lar size. Following the shape-in-bottle strategy, the ﬂexible organic 
component  was  ﬁrst  immobilized  in  the  framework,  and  then 
2 (L H ) in the 
CoBr 
2 -MIL-125. In a mixture of acetonitrile:TEOA:water 
cavities of NH 
2 - 
(5: 1: 0.1 v/v), the photocatalytic generation of H 
MIL-125 (TOF 0.8 h −1 ) was 20-times higher than that of NH 
2 -MIL- 
125 from a solution mixture of TEOA:acetonitrile:water (1: 5: 0.1 
v/v). This result was attributed to the rapid electron transfer from 
the LUMO level of MOFs (as sacriﬁcial host) to the Co III Br 
2 (L H ) sur- 
face, which led to the reduction of active cobalt centers (Co 3 ±to 
Co 2 ±)  where  the  photocatalysis  took  place.  A  similar  encapsula- 
tion approach was proposed to encapsulate NH 
2 -MIL-125 with the 
[Co II (TPA)Cl][Cl] (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-amine) for enhanced 
catalytic capability under visible irradiation [204] .

treatment of wastewater (organic dye and Cr(VI) reductions) [13] . 
Speciﬁcally, ZnO nanoparticles impregnated into MOFs were capa- 
ble  of  narrowing  the  bandgap  relative  to  the  pristine  MOFs  us- 
ing  heterostructure  formation.  Upon  excitation,  the  photogener- 
ated  charges  were  transferred  from  the  LUMO  level  of  MOFs  to 
ZnO  active  sites  (electron  trap)  to  enhance  the  reaction  kinet- 
ics  of  the  photocatalysis  under  visible  irradiation.  Likewise,  CdS, 
2 ), 
2 , and BiOBr were impregnated in MOFs such as UiO-66 (NH 
TiO 
MIL-68(Fe),  MIL-125  (Ti),  MIL-88B  (Fe),  CAU-17  (Bi-based  MOF: 
Christian-Albrechts-University), and ZIF-67, to enhance the photo- 
response activities under visible light [13] . 

4.4.3. Metal NPs 

In  general,  Pt,  Au,  Ag,  Pd,  Ni,  and  Cu  NPs  have  commonly 
been used as active co-catalysts to improve electron transfer due 
to  their  high  Fermi  energy  levels  [208-210] .  Encapsulated  metal 
NPs (MNPs) are expected to improve the e −/ h ± separation, thereby 
leading  to  enhanced  photocatalysis  [13] .  In  the  fabrication  of 
MNPs@MOFs,  the  selection  of  substantial  reducing  and  capping 
agents is of great importance to control the morphologies and dis- 
tributions of MNPs without agglomeration on the outer surfaces of 
the MOFs. Such capping agents inﬂuence the binding sites of MNPs 
and MOFs while preserving the porosity of MOFs [211] . For exam- 
ple, a Pt@NH 
2 -MIL-125 composite photocatalyst was fabricated by 
the double-solvent protocol [212] . This protocol involves the for- 
mation of an immiscible mixture by slow addition of an aqueous 
2 PtCl solution in methanol-water (9:1 v/v, hydrophilic solvent) to 
K 
a suspension of NH 
2 -MIL-125 in 10 mL hexane solvent (hydropho- 
bic  solvent).  Under  sonication,  the  hydrophilic  solvent  facilitated 
the uptake of hydrophilic precursor (Pt) by the hydrophilic inter- 
nal pores of MOFs, which facilitated the impregnation of Pt. As a 
2 -MIL-125 showed extended visible light absorption 
result, Pt@NH 
up to 500 nm with improved photocurrent stability ( ≥ 80% for 1 h) 
during H 
2 generation due to the high electron spillover caused by 
Pt NPs (4 nm), which favorably reduced photo-charge recombina- 
tion rate. The encapsulation of Pt, Au, and Pd NPs in pristine MIL- 
125(Ti) was also reported without using stabilizing/reducing agents 
during the synthesis procedure [213] . In this procedure, Ti 3 ±-MIL- 
125 (Ti 3 ± is a strong reducer with −1.37 V vs. SHE) was prepared 
ﬁrst by the photo-reduction of MIL-125(Ti) under N 
2 and UV–Vis 
light  (320–780  nm).  Subsequently,  direct  in-situ  redox  reactions 
between  Ti 3 ±-MIL-125  (reductive)  and  noble  metal  salts  (oxida- 
tive)  were  accomplished  in  the  dark  because  of  the  high  redox 
power  of  Ti 3 ±.  Thus,  M/MIL-125  (M  =  Pt,  Au,  and  Pd  NPs)  en- 
hanced photocatalysis in terms of H 
2  generation (up to 40 μmol 
for 5 h) and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (conversion of 
26.4–36%) to benzene aldehyde relative to MIL-125 ( ≤ 5 μmol H 
2 
and 18.9% conversion). Furthermore, Ag-MIL-125-AC (AC = acety- 
lacetone) was prepared by reacting MIL-125-NH 
2  with AC vapors 
under  N 
2  for  24  h,  which  further  acted  as  a  reducing  agent  for 
Ag ± ions in the solution mixture (acetonitrile/water;4:1 v/v) [214] . 
The developed Ag-MIL-125-AC (Ag NP of 5–10 nm) showed a re- 
markable shift to a visible-induced bandgap of 2.09 eV (593 nm) 
with high photocatalytic performance towards the decolorization 
of MB dye (99.5% in 90 min) for 5 cycles of reuse [214] . Ag@MIL- 
125  (Ag  NPs  40  nm)  formed  through  hydrothermal  and  photo- 
reduction  mediated  synthesis  was  also  reported  to  catalyze  the 
complete decomposition of RhB dye (i.e., 100% removal by 3 wt.% 
Ag-MIL-125 after 40 min) under visible light without apparent de- 
activation over 5 cycles [215] . The enhanced photodegradation per- 
formance was likely due to the enhanced catalytic capacity of Ag 
NPs, which acted as a co-catalyst to promote electron transfer to 
2 • − and • OH oxidative 
oxygen through the eﬃcient generation of O 
radicals. More recently, Fu and co-workers developed NH 
2 -MIL-125 
doped with Ni NPs to enhance visible-driven aerobic oxidation of 
benzyl alcohol using surface localized light sensitization of catalyt-

ically active Ni NPs (Ni 2 ± to Ni 0 ) [216] . In addition, Ni/NiO x  par- 
ticles  were  photo-deposited  on  MIL-101  with  erythrosine  B  sen- 
2  production  (82  μmol  h −1 )  under  vis- 
sitization  for  improved  H 
ible  light  [217] .  The  DFT  calculation  conﬁrmed  that  NiMo@MIL- 
101  nanocomposites  maintained  good  photocatalytic  stability  for 
2 production (740.2 μmol h −1 ) with a high QE of 75.7% at 520 nm 
H 
illumination at pH 7 [218] . 

4.4.4. Metal-free semiconductors and other functional NPs 

The immobilization of photoactive MOFs on inert carriers has 
drawn attention because of their high stability and capacity for se- 
lective capture of target molecules. For instance, 20 wt.% Amber- 
lite IRA200 (anionic) and Amberlite IRA 900 (cationic) resins were 
immobilized over MIL-53(Fe) to form MIL-53(Fe)-based composites 
(E g = 2.75 eV) with negative/positive surface charges (Zeta poten- 
tial −24 and ±2 mV, respectively) and high stability (5 cycles) in 
aqueous solutions [219] . The modulation of the surface charges of 
MIL-53(Fe)-based  composites  resulted  in  enhanced  visible-driven 
photocatalytic  degradation  ( ≥ 96%  after  2  h) of  anionic/cationic 
dyes (e.g., MB, RhB, Orange II, and Sulphorhodamine B) and im- 
proved electrostatic attraction of those dyes (3.3 mmol) from aque- 
ous solutions via a pre-adsorption process. Hybrid ZIF-8/BP com- 
posite was also developed via the in-situ growth of ZIF-8 on the 
functionalized  surface  of  2D  black  phosphorus  (BP)  nanosheets 
(300 nm) with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) by sonication for 5 h 
[220] . The PVP increased the electrostatic attraction of Zn 2 ± ions 
(metal center of ZIF-8) due to the presence of pyrrolidone rings, 
which  helped  ZIF-8  uniformly  deposit  onto  BP  nanosheets.  The 
fabricated  BP/ZIF-8  composite  resulted  in  the  high  degradation 
performance  of  MB  dye  (90%  with  the  photo-kinetic  rate  (k)  of 
4.49  × 10 −2  min −1 )  under  UV  irradiation.  Additionally,  the  BP 
nanosheets acted as an effective electron trap to hinder the e −/ h ±
recombination in ZIF-8 to improve the photocatalytic performance 
[220] . 

The  incorporation  of  plasmonic  Ag/AgCl  into  MIL-101 
(Ag/AgCl@MIL-101)  was  accomplished  via  the  vapor  diffusion- 
photoreduction  method  to  enhance  photocatalysis  under  visible 
irradiation [221] . The hetero-junctioned Ag/AgCl@MIL-101 (40wt% 
Ag/AgCl)  exhibited  higher  photodegradation  of  20  ppm  RhB  dye 
( ≥ 96% after 18 min with kinetic rate ( k) of 0.168 min −1 ) relative 
to  MIL-101  (32%),  Ag/AgCl  particles  (48%),  and  commercial  TiO 
2 
P25 ( ≤ 18%) under visible light ( ≥ 420 nm) [221] . The enhanced 
performance of Ag/AgCl@MIL-101 (3 runs stability) was attributed 
to  the  improved  photon  absorption  ( λ =  40 0–70 0  nm)  through 
SPR  of  Ag  NPs,  a  high  BET  surface  area  (2016  m 2 /g),  and  ef- 
fective  separation  of  e −/ h ± pairs.  Upon  irradiation,  the  Ag  NPs 
are  ﬁrst  excited  to  create  e − and  h ± sites  in  which  electrons 
are  transferred  to  the  MIL-101  for  reaction  with  dissolved  O 
2 
(electron  traps)  to  generate  O • .  In  the  meantime,  the  photo- 
induced  holes  move  to  the  AgCl  for  the  oxidation  of  Cl − to  Cl 0 
(reactive  radicals).  The  formed  O • − and  Cl 0  radicals  are  effec- 
tive  reactant  species  used  to  degrade  RhB  dye.  Also,  Ag/AgCl/Ag 
nanoﬁlm@ZIF-8  composite  (1:1  ratio)  was  synthesized  by  the 
deposition-photoreduction  approach.  The  formed  composite  was 
then investigated for the decomposition of 10 ppm RhB dye under 
visible  ( λ ≥ 420  nm)  light  [222] .  On  a  comparative  note,  the 
hybrid  Ag/AgCl@ZIF-8  exhibited  the  highest  photo-degradation 
eﬃciency  ( ≥ 98%  in  60  min)  of  RhB  with  higher  stability  (4 
runs), while the pristine ZIF-8 did not exhibit any photocatalysis 
(E g = 3.26 eV). In contrast, ZIF-8 had higher adsorption eﬃciency 
for RhB dye ( ≥ 99%) relative to Ag/AgCl/Ag nanoﬁlm@ZIF-8 (26% 
adsorption) in the dark. As such, the enhanced photodegradation 
performance  of  Ag/AgCl@ZIF-8  was  attributed  to  the  synergistic 
effects  of  (a)  adsorption  capability  of  ZIF-8  and  (b)  photocat- 
alytic  activity  of  Ag/AgCl.  During  photocatalysis,  ZIF-8  acted  as 
a  trap  for  the  photo-excited  electrons  to  quench  e −/ h ± pair 

11 O 

recombination  in  Ag/AgCl  catalyst  and  to  generate  superoxide 
(O • −) radicals by reaction with dissolved O 
2 , which initiated the 
degradation of adsorbed dye. An incipient wetness impregnation 
technique  was  also  used  to  incorporate  Ag  mono-substituted 
oxometallate  (POM:  Ag/PW 
39 )-doped  AgCl  NPs  into  MIL-101- 
2 ,  followed  by  photo-reduction  to  synthesize  visible-driven 
NH 
Ag/POM-AgCl@MIL-101-NH 
2  photocatalysts  [223] .  Under  visible 
2 was capable of completing 
irradiation, Ag/POM-AgCl@MIL-101-NH 
the photocatalytic reduction of 0.12 mmol/L 4-nitrophenol (100% 
in 20 min). Additionally, Ag/POM-AgCl@MIL-101-NH 
2  exhibited a 
high photodegradation eﬃciency toward 20 ppm RhB dye (88%: 3 
runs  stability)  in  reference  to  Ag/AgCl@MIL-101-NH 
2  (28%)  after 
150 min visible illumination. This indicates the key role of POM 
(no  visible  light  absorption)  in  promoting  the  photo-activity  of 
Ag/AgCl particles by storing the electrons on excited Ag NPs and 
suppressing the e −/ h ± recombination. 

Likewise,  Ag/rGO/MIL-125  was  fabricated  via  one-pot  self- 
assembly of GO onto Ag/MIL-125 using a photoreduction synthe- 
sis  strategy  [224] .  Ag/rGO/MIL-125  exhibited  a  1.62-times  faster 
degradation rate of RhB dye ( k = 0.0644 min −1 ) under visible light 
relative to MIL-125 [224] . Cr-MIL-101 was also encapsulated with 
Pd NPs and rGO (Pd/MIL-101/rGO). The obtained composites were 
tested against the photodegradation of triphenylmethane dyes in 
aqueous solution under visible light [225] . The resulting data re- 
vealed  the  enhanced  performance  of  Pd/MIL-101/rGO  composite 
towards dye removal (100% after 15 min with stability up to ﬁve 
cycles) relative to MIL-101/rGO (81%) and MIL-101 (65%) [225] . It 
is thus concluded that the deposition of Pd NPs provided signiﬁ- 
cant control over the photocatalytic activity towards target removal 
due to its high catalytic activity. In another study, the hybridization 
of 2D graphene-like carbon nitride (g-C 
4 ) with MIL-53 materi- 
4 /MIL-53(Fe)) 
3 N 
als (i.e., 20 wt.% g-C 
was also reported to upgrade photocatalytic activity under visible 
irradiation [13] . The 100% photodegradation eﬃciency of 10 ppm 
4 /MIL-53(Al)  (E g  =  2.64  eV)  was 
RhB  dye  over  (20  wt.%)  g-C 
achieved after 75 min of visible-irradiation as compared with g- 
4 (13%); the proposed method also showed high stability even 
C 
after 5 cycles [226] . Such enhanced performance can be explained 
by the rapid interfacial photo-excited charge transfer (via π - π con- 
jugation and C-N bonds in g-C 
4 pho- 
toactive  catalyst  (E g  =  2.7  eV  with  potential  CB  at  −1.3  eV  and 
VB  at  1.4  eV)  to  MIL-53  (acting  as  electron  trap)  [13 , 168] .  The 
trapped electrons on MIL-53 surfaces hindered the e −/ h ± pair re- 
combination on excited g-C 
4 (long-lived excited state), thus ac- 
celerating the photogeneration of oxidative radical species for dye 
degradation.

5. Performance evaluation of MOF photocatalysts 

Photocatalytic activity is an index for the number of molecules 
that are degraded/converted by a single active site over a unit of 
time  [227] .  The  photocatalytic  activities  of  MOFs  depend  on  the 
applied photon energy (in terms of light source power and wave- 
length), the nature of MOF photocatalysts, and the photocatalytic 
system. Accordingly, the development of proper procedures to as- 
sess/compare the photocatalytic activities of MOFs in environmen- 
tal and energy applications is a matter of concern for determining 
the best structure for solar energy and environmental applications 
under real-world conditions. 

In line with the general theory for photocatalysis, the photocat- 
alytic performances of MOFs can be evaluated in terms of the con- 
version eﬃciency, quantum eﬃciency (QE or quantum yield ( (cid:6)λ)), 
and reaction rate. Among these metrics, the QE term ( Eq. (3) ) is 
recommended as one of the best parameters to evaluate the pho- 
tocatalytic performance [228] . When computing the QE term, it is 
assumed that all extracted photons are absorbed on the surface of 

S.A. Younis, E.E. Kwon and M. Qasim et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 81 (2020) 100870 

23 

a photocatalyst and consumed completely during photocatalytic re- 
actions. Based on the QE formula, the QE value is proportional to 
the increased number of photo-reacted molecules during the pho- 
toreaction and is inversely proportional to the number of photons 
absorbed by each MOF photocatalyst. It should, however, be noted 
that the use of QE is still debatable in a heterogeneous photocatal- 
ysis, as it is not easy to accurately measure the photons absorbed 
on  the  suspended  photocatalysts  in  solutions  (e.g.,  due  to  light 
reﬂection/scattering  and/or  catalysts  aggregations).  On  this  basis, 
the QE metric may not be meaningful for evaluating the photo- 
catalytic activities of heterogeneous MOFs photocatalysts operated 
under various experimental parameters (e.g. , irradiation spans, re- 
actor geometries, and concentration of substrates), which play a vi- 
tal role in enhancing energy absorption, MOF stability, and catalytic 
eﬃciency. Therefore, the use of the QE as a metric to compare the 
photocatalytic performances of MOFs is not fully justiﬁable to ap- 
ply under various conditions of their applications [229] . 

To  overcome  the  limitation  of  the  QE  metric,  the  concept  of 
“ﬁgure of merit” (FoM, Eq. (4) ) was employed as a supporting met- 
ric to help reduce the bias in performance comparisons between 
different MOF photocatalysts in various applications. The numeri- 
cal expression of FoM can be made in a number of respects as re- 
ported in our recent report (e.g., the kinetic rate per unit mass of 
catalyst, consumed photo-energy per total mass of catalyst to de- 
struct given target molecules, and/or relative performance in ref- 
erence to benchmarking photocatalyst) [228] . Herein, the FoM val- 
ues are computed in terms of the relative photosensitivity (needed 
for the absorption/conversion of incident-photon energy into elec- 
trons) between the tested photocatalysts and the benchmark MOF 
photocatalyst. For FoM analysis, the performance of each catalyst 
(m) considered in this review was normalized to the benchmarked 
catalyst (BM) with the highest QE to fairly assess their practical 
uses  (e.g. ,  photo-remediation,  photocatalytic  oxidation  reactions, 
CO 
2 production). As such, the FoM values can be 
deﬁned as a dimensionless ratio of QE (as per mass of photocata- 
lyst), as compiled in Tables 1S to 4S (See supplementary materials, 
SM). The overall photocatalytic performance can be estimated by 
the QE and FoM (Eqs. (3) and (4) , respectively) for each selected 
MOF photocatalyst along with the modulation strategy used to im- 
prove their optical properties as given in Tables 1S to 4S (in the 
3 S-WSx/Co-ZIF-9 composite, which was 
SM ﬁle). In this review, CO 
tested for HER (Table 3S) with a computed QE value of 1.36E-03 
(FoM = 1.0), was selected as the benchmark MOF photocatalyst for 
all the computational performance comparison based on FoM cri- 
terion.

Here,  QE m  and  C ( g ) m  are  the  quantum  eﬃciency  and  the 
amount of MOF catalyst being evaluated, whereas the QE 
BM is the 
highest  quantum  eﬃciency  (along  with  its  dose  ( C ( g ) Bm )  during 
the experimental study in the literature) case in Tables 1S to 4S, 
which was used as the benchmark to calculate FoM. 

Overall,  Tables  1S  to  4S  show  almost  all  Zeolitic  Imidazolate 
Framework (ZIF)-based photocatalysts exhibited superior FoM val- 
ues  (e.g.,  up  to  1)  compared  with  other  functionalized  MOF  se- 
ries (e.g., MIL, PCN, or UiO; with FoM ≤ 1). This may reﬂect the 
effective  properties  of  ZIF-MOFs  (such  as  tunable  porosity,  ther- 
modynamic stability, host-guest interaction chemistry, and semi- 
conducting  characteristics)  that  enhance  their  photocatalytic  sta- 
bilities over longer durations. Among them, NiP@ZIF-67 [230] and 
4 -WS x @Co-ZIF-9  [231]  showed  the  highest  QE  (1.02E-03  to

benchmarked  photocatalyst)  in  the  hydrogen  evolution  reaction 
(HER) was attributed to the multitudinous active sites provided by 
doped CO

to NiP doping. In comparison, the prepared ZIF-67 MOF encapsu-

ness for the photocatalytic generation of H

of photoreacted molecules during photocatalysis without suﬃcient 
quantities  of  effective  active  sites  in  catalytic  reduction  of  the

RuN 
3 @ZiF-67 is due to the lower number of active catalytic sites 
(e.g., semiconductors or noble metal sites) needed for the acceler- 
ation of water splitting reactions. The performances of photocata- 
lysts are summarized based on their application for dyes or metals 
in Table 1S (in the SM). Accordingly, Cu(II)-BPY-based MOFs out- 
performed all other MOF-based photocatalysts with organic dyes 
with a photodegradation rate of 10.5 mmol g −1 h −1 (FoM of 1.23E- 
02) [232] . In addition, Pt-doped MIL-100 exhibited a superior pho- 
toreduction  rate  of  Cr(VI)  (1.79  mmol  g −1  h −1 )  [233] ,  but  at  a 
lower FoM value (3.47E-03) relative to Cu(II)-BPY-based MOF. The 
enhanced photocatalytic rates of those MOF photocatalysts in en- 
vironmental treatment were ascribed to the improved adsorption 
of organic/inorganic pollutants on the catalytic surface. Under light 
irradiation, noble metal doped co-catalysts (e.g., Pt) also acted as 
electron traps for the photogenerated electrons on excited MOFs, 
thereby leading to enhanced e −/ h ± separation and the photo-redox 
reaction  of  the  adsorbed  pollutants.  In  terms  of  oxidation  reac- 
tions, Ru(bpy) 
2 (Table 2S) was superior for the pho- 
tocatalytic  oxidation  of  alcohols  (at  238  mmol  g −1  h −1 )  with  a 
FoM  of  2.59E-01  and  a  QE  of  1.76E-04  [234] .  Among  all  MOF- 
2 reduction (Table 4S), silver doped Co- 
based photocatalysts for CO 
ZIF-9 (Ag@Co-ZIF-9) exhibited an outstanding photo-reduction rate 
(5.62 × 10 4 mmol g −1 h −1 ) with the highest FoM value of 1.66E- 
01  [235] .  The  superior  performance  of  Ag@Co-ZIF-9  toward  CO 
2 
was  ascribed  to  the  enhanced  surface  plasmon  resonance  (SPR) 
by silver doping, which improved the UV-visible photon absorp- 
tion along with the effective separation of e −/ h ± pairs. In the case 
of  Ru(bpy) 
3  groups 
2 ,  the  use  of  NH 
as  photosensitizers  to  functionalize  MIL-125(Ti)  led  to  improved 
photon harvesting up to 800 nm and a site-by-site hopping en- 
3 ] 2 ±
ergy  transfer  mechanism  (MLCT)  from  the  excited  [Ru  (bpy) 
complex  to  Ti-oxo-metal  sites  of  MIL-125(Ti)  photocatalysts.  In 
fact, there were large variations in FoM values for the same MOF 
photocatalyst  in  different  applications.  For  example,  the  reaction 
rates for MIL-125-NH 
2  (Tables 1S and 2S in the SM ﬁle) towards 
the photoreduction of Cr(VI) [236] and photo-oxidation of amine 
[237] were 1.31 and 1.13 mmol g −1  h −1 , respectively. The perfor- 
2 also showed high variabilities in the pho- 
mance of MIL-125-NH 
tocatalytic  reduction  rate  of  CO 
2  to  formate  from  16.0  to  26.3 
μmol  g −1  h −1  (Table  4S).  Such  variations  in  photocatalytic  per- 
formances  are  mainly  attributed  to  the  changes  in  MOF  proper- 
ties (surface area/porosity and optical properties: See Tables 1S, 3S, 
and 4S in the SM ﬁle) and experimental conditions (the amount 
of  catalyst  used,  target  redox  reaction,  and  irradiation  time)  be- 
tween  different  reported  studies.  As  observed  from  the  compar- 
ative  evaluation,  the  FoM  values  of  each  MOF  photocatalyst  can 
vary greatly. As such, a comparative analysis of their performances 
also  veriﬁed  that  the  modiﬁcation  methods  used  in  the  synthe- 
sis of MOF photocatalysts and the optimization of applied exper- 
imental conditions play essential roles in improving their photo-

catalytic activities. In light of such observations, the following sec- 
tions are organized to discuss the details of photocatalytic perfor- 
mances  of  MOFs  in  different  photocatalytic  reactions  along  with 
their synthesis/modulation to improve the optical/surface proper- 
ties.

contaminants

6 -oxo  ([Zr 

Many MOF photocatalysts have been developed and tested for 
the photo-degradation of organic pollutants (e.g., textile dyes, phar- 
maceutical by-products, and aromatic compounds: Table 1S) in var- 
ious aquatic environments [120 , 238] . Among those MOFs, d -block 
transition  metal-based  MOFs  (e.g.,  Zn(II),  Fe  (II)/(III),  Co(II)/(III), 
Zr(IV), Ti(III)/(IV), Ni(II), Cd(II), and Cu(II)) showed high potential 
photocatalytic activities for environmental remediation [120 , 239] . 
Based on the LMCT mechanism, the integration of a chromophore 
ligand or photosensitizer (e.g., porphyrin) into the d -block transi- 
tion  metal-based MOF  photocatalysts was  also  suggested  to  eﬃ- 
ciently improve their photocatalytic remediation capacities under 
visible light irradiation. For instance, the porphyrin ligand in PCN- 
222 (e.g., Zr-MOF) led to improved harvested visible photon energy 
8 ] 8 −)  clus- 
upon  irradiation.  In  this  case,  Zr 
ters acted as a “trap” center for the excitation state of porphyrin 
to increase the lifespan of e −/ h ± separation ( Fig. 17 (a-b)) [9] . The 
photo-separated  holes  ( h ±)  in  the  HOMO  and  electrons  ( e −)  in 
LUMO levels further interacted with the water/hydroxide ions to 
produce hydroxyl ( • OH) radicals. The formation of active • OH rad- 
icals is an initial step in the degradation of the environmental or- 
ganic pollutants through consecutive redox reactions [86] . In the 
meantime, the electrons transferred from the LUMO state to metal 
nodes  facilitated  redox  reactions  onto  SBUs  to  reduce  molecular

radicals further reacted with organic pollutants or their interme- 
diates to complete the oxidative pathway. Accordingly, the active 
metal clusters are one of the main factors inﬂuencing the photo- 
catalytic performance during pollutant degradation into non-/less- 
poisonous intermediates or CO 
2 [121] . The photocatalytic oxidation 
processes of the full photocatalytic mineralization pathway for or- 
ganic pollutants can be described in terms of Eq. (5) [240] .

MOFs are also applied for the environmental remediation of in- 
organic pollutants (e.g., reduction of Cr(IV) to Cr(III), Table 1S). For 
example,  a  Fe(III)  based  MOF  (MIL-88B)  was  used  for  photocat- 
alytic Cr(IV) reduction reactions under visible light [11] . The pro- 
posed photoreactions in the oxidative/reductive sites of MOF-88B 

Note that most of the d -block transition metal MOFs in the lit- 
erature  suffer  from  instabilities  for  UV-driven  catalytic  activities 
(wavelength ≤ 380 nm), which restrict their practical implemen- 
tation. Hence, the PSM of MOFs (e.g., doping with co-active cata- 
lysts and/or ligand functionalization) is frequently utilized to en- 
hance the eﬃcacy of visible-driven photocatalysis. Also, the cou- 
pling  of  MOF  heterogeneous  photocatalysts  with  other  homoge- 
2 or Fenton-like reagents for advance oxidation 
nous catalysts (H 
process (AOPs)) was used to improve the photocatalytic reaction 
rate  in  two  ways:  (i)  enhancing  e −/ h ± pair  separation  by  acting 
as  an  alternative  electron  acceptor  at  the  CB  level  and  (ii)  pro- 
moting self-decomposition by irradiation to produce active oxidant 
radicals [120 , 121] . In fact, almost all heterogeneous photocatalysis 
of MOFs in environmental applications are believed to follow the 
LMCT mechanism.

For  example,  MOF-5  was  the  ﬁrst  photocatalyst  for  environ- 
mental  remediation  (i.e. ,  photodestruction  of  phenol  and  2,6-di- 
tert-butylphenol (DTBP) in a water solution) [241] . MOF-5 is com- 
posed of Zn 
4 O clusters connected orthogonally by BDC ligands (See 
Fig. 4 ); it has a bandgap of 3.4 eV (UV-region) and an actual CB 
of  0.2  V  versus  the  normal  hydrogen  electrode  (NHE)  [120] .  In 
the photocatalytic application, MOF-5 showed a reverse size/shape- 
selectivity  during  the  decomposition  of  phenol  pollutants  (e.g., 
photocatalytic reaction rate ratios of k(DTBP)/k(Phenol) values in 
the range of 1.1 to 4.42, Fig. 18 ) under UV-irradiation [239] . This 
most  likely  reﬂects  the  steric  factors  of  quickly  adsorbed  DTBP 
on the surface (e.g. , the inability of large DTBP molecules to ac- 
cess  the  interior  microspores  of  MOF-5).  A  photolytic  pathway 
by MOF-5 was postulated via a network of photoreactions. Such 
photo-induced reactions involve radical cations and/or active oxy- 
gen species generated by electron transfers (from phenol/DTBP pol- 
lutants to MOF-5 hole) and the reaction of the photo-ejected elec- 
trons with oxygen.

Motivated by the discovery of MOF-5, Zr-/Ti-based MOFs (Table 
1S) were further tested for the photolysis of complex organic pol- 
lutants in wastewater [9 , 79 , 85 , 240] . Among Ti-MOFs, MIL-125(Ti) 
([Ti 
6 ])  offers  high  potential  for  environmental  re- 
mediation  due  to  the  fast  reversible  redox  conversion  between 
Ti 4 ±/Ti 3 ± upon  UV-irradiation  and  its  excellent  photostability  in 
various aqueous systems [88] . Likewise, a typical water-tolerant Zr- 
6 SBUs is a ver- 
MOF (UiO-66 and ZIF-n-Types) constructed from Zr 
satile photocatalyst for wastewater treatment [85] . The redox po- 
6 SBUs is higher than the LUMO level of the organic 
tential of the Zr 
linkers. In these contexts, Zr 
6  SBUs are not effective in terms of 
an electron acceptor from the organic linker under visible irradia- 
tion. Compared with UV-driven Zr-/Ti-based MOFs, several visible- 
light-driven MOFs have recently been proposed for the degradation 
of various environmental contaminants. For instance, NH 
2 -MIL-125 
(E g  =  2.6  eV  and  BET  =  1130  m 2  g −1 :  Table  1S)  showed  excel- 
lent stability and activity in the photodegradation of textile dyes 
in the UV-visible spectrum [79] . Under visible light, the photocat- 
alytic performance of NH 
2 -MIL-125 for the degradation of textile 
dyes (e.g., RhB dye) improved when incorporated with BiOBr NPs 
−MIL-125: photocatalytic rate of 0.1 mmol g −1 h −1 , Ta- 
(BiOBr/NH 
2 
ble 1S) [242] . Likewise, the performance of pristine MIL-125 was 
promoted by the construction of heterostructured nanocomposite 
photocatalysts  with  other  semiconducting  catalysts.  For  instance, 
the  formation  of  g-C 
3 /MIL-125  core- 
shell  [244]  showed  an  enhanced  photodegradation  performance 
against RhB dye (0.25 mmol g −1 h −1 ) and tetracycline (0.22 mmol 
g −1 h −1 ), respectively, under visible irradiation. In these cases, the

ing the number of active catalytic sites. As such, the photocatalytic 
performances of heterostructure composites were signiﬁcantly im- 
proved (relative to pristine MIL-125) under visible light.

Among  MIL-53  series  (Table  1S),  MIL-53(Fe)  (bandgap  of 
2.72  eV)  showed  the  best  photocatalytic  stability  (5  cycles)  for 
the  degradation  of  methylene  blue  (MB)  under  visible  and  UV- 
visible light, with a rate of 0.0133 min −1  ( ≈1200 mmol • g −1 • h −1 ) 
[245] .  More  recently,  the  photocatalytic  activities  for  the  MIL- 
100(M) series (M = V, Al, Fe, and Cr) relative to UiO-66-R (R = H, 
NO 
2 )  and  MIL-47(V)  were  tested  for  decolorization  of 
MB-contaminated  water  under  UV-visible  irradiation  [246] .  The 
bandgaps of these MOFs were found to increase in the order of 
MIL-100 (V) ≤ MIL-47(V) ≤ Mil-100 (Fe) ≤ MIL-101 (Cr) ≤ MIL-100 
(Cr) ≈UiO-66(Zr) ≤ MIL-100 (Al) with E g values of 2.75, 2.76, 2.80, 
3.66, 3.86, 3.88, and 4.06 eV, respectively. This order indicates that 
there is a relationship between the energy levels of SBUs (acting as 
a discrete quantum dots) and the conjugated carboxylic moieties of 
DBC or BTC organic ligands (e.g. , the polarization/electronegativity 
change  of  the  M-O  bond).  Isoreticular  UiO-66-NH 
2  and  UiO-66- 
2  [E g  =  2.91  eV]  showed  a  lower  bandgap  in  comparison  to 
NO 
pristine UiO-66 [E g = 3.88 eV] due to the resonance effect of NH 
2 
2  ligand moieties [246] . Further, the photocatalytic ability 
and NO 
of UiO-66-NH 
2 led to the best performance (photocatalytic rate of 
0.08 mmol h −1 g −1 at pH 7) that was two-fold higher than that of 
MIL-100 M (M = Cr and V) and pristine UiO-66. This was attributed 
to the resonance-donating effect of amine functionality, which im- 
proves the attraction of MB dye on the catalyst surface via acid- 
base adsorption before photocatalysis. Additionally, an increase in 
electron-donation  from  the  -NH 
2  to  the  BDC  ligand  leads  to  in- 
creases in the electron density of the aromatic ring (e.g., p -system) 
that can facilitate the photoexcitation of MOFs under visible light. 
Consequently, the PSM of the ligand with active amine functional 
groups for photolysis is an effective means of increasing the pho- 
tocatalytic performance. 

In  the  ﬁeld  of  MOF  photocatalysis,  a  great  deal  of  attention 
has  been  paid  to  the  puriﬁcation  of  diverse  emergent  pharma- 
ceutical  pollutants  (such  as  active  medical  agents  (antibiotics) 

VB = 2.28 V and E 

and personal care products) in wastewater, as listed in Table 1S. 
A  comparison  of  the  related  results  indicated  the  superior  per- 
formance  of  MIL-53(Fe)  photocatalyst  for  rapid  degradation  of 
tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCL: 99.7% removal with a rate of 
2.35  mmol  g −1  h −1 )  through  coupling  between  visible-induced 
heterogeneous  photocatalysis  and  persulfate  radical-driven  AOPs 
(SR-AOPs)  [247] .  Notably,  the  photocatalytic  performance  of  the 
coupled SR-AOPs/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalysis was ﬁve times higher 
than  that  obtained by  MIL-53(Fe) photocatalysis alone (17.1% re- 
moval with rate constant of 6.5185  × 10 −4  min −1 ). The low pho- 
tocatalytic activity of MIL-153(Fe) (a semiconductor) was attributed 
CB  = −0.40 V 
to its energy bandgap positions (E 
vs. NHE), which allowed photoexcitation of molecular O 
2  for the 
generation  of  • O 
− radicals.  The  reduction  potential  of  • OH/OH −
2 
(2.40 V vs. NHE) is slightly higher than that of the E 
VB band po- 
sition in MIL-53 (Fe); hence, the generation of • OH radicals is not 
possible [247] . In coupled RR-AOPs/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalysis, the 
addition of persulfate led to the activation of the iron metal site 
(Fe(III)) for the photogeneration of more electrons in MIL-53(Fe). 
In the meantime, persulfate acted as an acceptor for the photo- 
• − and 
generated electrons to produce reactive radical species (SO 
4 
• OH: Eqs. (8) −(12) ), while suppressing the recombination of e −/ h + 
charge in MIL-53(Fe) (i.e., enhanced photoactivity) [248 , 249] . The 
increased production of these strong oxidant species in the reac- 
tion signiﬁcantly enhanced the photocatalytic performance of MIL- 
153(Fe) towards TC-HCL antibiotic contaminants in the aqueous so- 
lution.

showed  a  satisfactory  photocatalytic  degradation  activity  against 
metronidazole (MTZ: 96% with a rate constant of 0.04 mmol g −1 
h −1 ) and cephalexin (CFX: 90% with a rate constant of 0.013 mmol 
g −1  h −1 )  under  UV-visible  irradiation  (400  W • m −2 )  [250] .  The 
higher degradation rate  of this composite against MTZ  over CFX 
was attributed to an alteration in the aﬃnity of surface catalyst for 
the adsorption of pollutants based on pKa and pH 
PZC values under 
experimental conditions. During photocatalysis under visible light, 
the dual Z-scheme structure of ternary CuWO 
3 @ZIF-67 com- 
posite (E g = 1.75 eV) remarkably diminished charge recombination 
while improving photocatalytic degradation towards MTZ/CFX pol- 
lutants. In this case, photoinduced holes ( h ±) in ZIF-67 VB were 
transferred and recombined with the CB electrons ( e −) of Bi 
3 , 
while  the  h ±active  sites  in  Bi 
3  VB  were  recombined  with  the 
2 S 
4 CB electrons. Accordingly, the accumulated photogenerated 
CuWO 
−. , 
e − in ZIF-67 CB (redox potential = −0.65 eV) can reduce O

2 
2 O to generate • OH radicals. Similarly, the ac- 
then reacting with H 
cumulated h ± in CuWO 
2 O to produce • OH 
radical species (as the primary reactive oxidant). As non-selective 
strong oxidant species, the generated • OH radicals can participate 
in  the  degradation  of  diversiﬁed  non-biodegradable  drug  pollu- 
tants  in  water  solutions.  Likewise,  the  relative  ordering  of  pho- 
tocatalytic performance of MOF composite photocatalysts for the 
removal of  tetracycline  (TC)  under  visible  irradiation  follows the 
descending order of Cd-MOF derived CdS/NC-500 (7.2 mmol g −1 
h −1 ) ≥ In 
2 @MIL- 
101(Fe) (6.84 × 10 −4 mmol g −1 h −1 ) (Table 1S). Of particular note, 
the  CdS/NC-500  photocatalyst  (E g =  1.95  eV)  was  synthesized  by 
the in-situ growth of cadmium sulﬁde (CdS) onto nitrogen-doped 
carbon (NC) support through direct carbonization of Cd-MOF con- 
taining 4-aminoazobenzene-4 (cid:8) -sulfonic acid ligand at 500 °C [251] . 
As such, the superior photocatalytic performance of CdS/NC–500 
was likely to reﬂect the enhanced composite conductivity and in- 
creased lifetime of photogenerated charges by the synergism be- 
tween CdS semiconductor NPs and NC support [252] .

Many forms of porous nanostructured-photocatalysts were also 
derived from the carbonization of MOFs for the effective treatment 
of  diverse  classes  of  organic  pollutants  [253] .  Aside  from  these 
porous nanostructured photocatalysts, TiO 
4 [255 , 256] , 
ZnO  or  CuO x  [257] ,  and  Fe x O y  [258]  nanoscale  photocatalysts 
have been synthesized from thermal treatment of MOF precursors 
with tunable morphologies (such as MIL-125, ZIF-67, MOF-5, MOF- 
199,  and  Fe-MIL-88).  Recently,  our  group  also  reported  the  syn- 
thesis of new Ce/Tb-doped MOF-76 nanocomposites encapsulated 
with gold and silver nanoparticles (GNPs and SNPs) for photocat- 
alytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol in aqueous solution [259] . Indeed, 
these  nanocomposites  exhibited  outstanding  photoactivity  com- 
pared with commercial photocatalyst (Degussa P25 TiO 
2 nanopar- 
ticles) towards 4-nitrophenol reduction. Among them, GNPs@MOF- 
76 (Ce) (MOF-76(1a)) exhibited the highest performance for pho- 
toreduction of 4-nitrophenol (96.3% removal with an apparent rate 
constant (K (cid:8) 
app ) = 0.33 min −1 ) and satisfactory recyclability over 3 
cycles. 

5.1.2. Photocatalytic removal of gaseous air pollutants 

MOF photocatalysts have signiﬁcantly contributed to the abate- 
ment  of  various  air  pollutants  (e.g.,  gaseous  NO x  and  warfare 
agents), as listed in Table 1S. The photocatalytic removal of gaseous 
nitrogen oxides (NO x : NO and NO 
2 ) will be discussed this section 
because of their high emission rate from fossil fuels and negative 
inﬂuence on the environment and human health (e.g., respiratory 
disease and immune system problems) [260 , 261] . In this respect, 
heterogenous MOF photocatalysis exhibited promising performance 
for the abatement of NO x  at high pollution levels in urban envi- 
ronments  via  photocatalytic  oxidation  of  gaseous  NO x  to  nitrate

these photocatalysts also exhibited excellent photocatalytic stabil- 
ity for reuse cycles (5 to 8 times). In the case of N/CQDs/MIL-125

(Table 1S), the TiO

3 
(with a small amount of NO 
2 : 25 ppb) [263] . In contrast, N/CQD 
(2.5 vol.% nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots) served as electron 
trapping sites to enhance the separation of photogenerated e −/ h ±
pairs. During photocatalysis, the BDC ligand of MIL-125(Ti) is ex- 
cited to generate e –/ h ± pairs. Under photon-excitation, the photo- 
generated electrons (e –) can be transferred from the MIL-125(Ti) to 
N/CQD (trapping site), leaving a hole ( h ±) in the VB (charge sepa- 
ration). At the same time, the photoinduced electrons of N/CQDs 
also migrated to CB of the catalytically active Ti-metallic center of 
MIL-125(Ti), leading to the reduction of Ti 4 ± to Ti 3 ±. The formed 
Ti 3 ± (CB = −1.03 eV) reacted with adsorbed O 
2 molecules to pro- 
−• radicals, while the H

to accelerate visible-driven photo-conversion of NO x to NO 
[265] .  In  this  case,  the  photocatalytic  performance  of  CQDs/ZIF- 
8(Zn) composite against 420 ppb NO x was improved with increas- 
ing CQDs loading from 0.1 to 0.5 vol.% (i.e., 43% conversion com- 
pared  to  7.1%  by  bare  ZIF-8).  Notably,  the  photoactivity  of  0.5- 
CQDs/ZIF-8 towards the oxidation of NO x  was reduced by 9% af- 
ter three successive cycles. This reduced performance may be ac- 
counted for by the possible deactivation of active sites by the ad- 
− and/or alteration of ZIF-8 framework property (tex- 
sorbed NO 
3 
ture  and  morphology)  during  photoreactions.  During  photocatal- 
ysis,  CQDs  played  a  critical  role  in  the  enhanced  photocatalytic 
conversion of NO x over ZIF-8 (Zn 
4 N tetrahedral site) through im- 
proving photocurrent response (1.6 times higher relative to pris- 
tine ZIF-8) under visible-irradiation (up to 600 nm) and diminish- 
ing e −/ h ± recombination (i.e., increasing the number of photogen- 
erated charge carriers).

2 , NO x , and H 

A series of Fe-MOFs (MIL-101, MIL-53, and MIL-88B) have also 
been utilized as greener heterogeneous photocatalysts for photo- 
3 [266] . Among them, MIL-101(Fe) 
oxidation of gaseous NO x to NO 
exhibited the highest performance, with an eﬃciency of 76% de- 
NO x photoactivity (relative to 14.5 to 18.3% by MIL-88B and MIL- 
53, respectively) after 60 min reaction under solar light (Table 1S). 
This might be due to the high surface area (1642 m 2 g −1 ) and large 
pore volume (0.91 cm 3 g −1 ) of MIL-101(Fe) as compared to MIL-53 
and MIL-88B (surface area 14.7–116 m 2 g −1 ), which allowed fast- 
diffusion of gas reactants (O 
2 O) into the network for 
promoting interactions with coordinatively unsaturated Fe 3 ± active 
sites. Further, MIL-101(Fe) showed higher photon-induced electron 
transition (i.e., high photon absorption at 200 – 350 nm) than that 
of two other Fe-based MOFs. Compared with commercial photocat- 
2 ), MIL-101(Fe) showed outstanding photocatalytic 
alyst (P-25 TiO 
3 – (73.8%  relative  to 
selectivity  for  the  conversion  of  NO  to  NO 
64.4% by P-25). Over a 1 h photocatalytic reaction, the yielded NO 
2 
product over MIL-101(Fe) was maintained at 3.3% (10 ppb), which 
is  three  times  lower  than  that  produced  by  P25  (30 ppb)  [266] . 
These results veriﬁed the better performance of MIL-101(Fe) over 
2 in terms of NO x removal and reducing toxic by-products 
P25 TiO 
2 ) during photocatalysis. Based on the LMCT mechanism 
(e.g., NO 
(BDC–to-Fe 3 ± site),  the  photogenerated  electrons  are  transferred 
from BDC LUMO to Fe 
3 -oxo clusters, which are also excited un- 
der irradiation to produce e −/ h ± pairs. These charge carriers re- 
acted with surface H 
2 (reduction) to generate 
−• radicals, respectively. The formed oxidative radicals, 
• OH and O 
2 
together with h ± active sites, were synergistically reacted with ad- 
3 and a small amount of intermediate by- 
sorbed NO to form HNO

by low-temperature annealing of ZIF-67 (300 °C for 3 h) for the 
enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability of NO under visible 
irradiation (Table 1S) [267] . This formed p-n heterojunction struc- 
ture effectively enhanced the separation of photogenerated carri- 
− (57% after 60 min vis- 
ers, thus improving NO conversion to NO

In terms of atmospheric pollution abatement, researchers have 
recently been focusing on the photocatalytic degradation of chem-

cent examples of MOFs photocatalysis against gaseous CWA degra- 
dation are presented in Table 1S. For instance, porphyrin IX (PPIX),

catalytic  oxidation  of  2-chloroethyl  ethyl  sulﬁde  (CEES,  a  sulfur 
mustard gas analog) [268] . The prepared PPIX@NU-10 0 0 photocat- 
alyst  exhibited  enhanced  photo-oxidation  of  CEES  with  a  higher 
photocatalytic rate (100% (1.46 mmol g −1 h −1 ): half-lives (T 
1/2 ) of 
2.0  – 2.1  min)  as  compared  to  pristine  NU-10 0 0  MOF  (30%  af- 
ter  30  min)  in  the  presence  of  UV-visible  (395– 465  nm)  irra- 
diation.  Under  a  white  LED  light  (430–780  nm),  PPIX@NU-10 0 0 
also  showed  higher  photocatalytic  performance  (T 
1/2  of  23  min) 
than  that  of  NU-10 0 0  (~20%  of  CEES  removal  after  30  min). 
The improved performance of PPIX@NU-10 0 0 was assumed to be 
due  to  the  existence  of  PPIX  photosensitizer,  which  excited  to 
its  triplet  state  under  white  light.  The  electrons  in  the  triplet 
state reacted with molecular O

which  initiated  a  soft-oxidation  reaction  for  the  conversion  of 
CEES  to  sulfoxide  product,  2-chloroethyl  ethyl  sulfoxide  (CEESO)

Based  on  the  TOF  value,  the  photocatalytic  oxidation  of  CEES 
over PP@Al-PMOF was 12 to 20-fold higher than those obtained 
by  other  reported  Zr-MOF  powders  such  as  PCN-222/MOF-545

tocatalytic  rate  for  the  PP@Al-PMOF  fabric  (over  Al-PMOF  pow-

the photo-oxidation reaction, while Al-PMOF catalyst on the ﬁber 
was uniformly illuminated with relatively low light scattering (no 
aggregation). As such, PP@Al-PMOF exhibited a fast response for 
visible-light excitation of the chromophoric ligand, which then led 
to the generation of 1 O

A  porphyrin-based  Zr-MOF  has  also  been  prepared  and  tested 
towards the simultaneous photo-detoxiﬁcation of different CWAs 
(such as dimethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP) and CEES mus- 
tard gas) under blue LED irradiation at room temperature in the

In light of the high stability of porphyrin-MOFs, numerous re-

LED  light  (465–475  nm),  such  as  Por-MOFs  (T

composite MOF-based catalyst [Cu-BTC MOF/g-C 
4 nanospheres:

MOFgCNox] has also been reported for the enhanced catalytic sta- 
bility towards detoxiﬁcation of CWAs such as dimethyl chlorophos- 
phate nerve agents (DMCP vapors) under ambient light irradiation 
[277] .  In  this  case,  the  prepared  MOFgCNox  was  loaded  onto  T- 
shirt ﬁber to construct smart textile ﬁbers for the decomposition of 
4 . The oxidation/hydrolysis mechanism of 
the DMCP vapors to H 
DMCP over MOFgCNox can occur in multiple stages. First, the as- 
synthesized MOFgCNox catalyst adsorbed DMCP vapors via com- 
plexation mechanism between DMCP (P = O group) and the un- 
saturated Cu(II) metal sites or the hydroxyl groups of the uncoor- 
dinated BTC units. Similar interactions (polar or hydrogen bonds) 
can also take place between DMCP and g-C 
4  functionalities (–
NO x , –OH, and –NH x  groups), resulting in the higher adsorption 
of  DMCP  on  MOFgCNox.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the 
chemical adsorption interaction between DMCP and Cu(II)/BTC ac- 
tive sites may lead to the partial deformation/collapse of Cu-MOF 
crystal structures. In the second stage, the adsorbed DMCP under- 
went hydrolysis decomposition to DMP through the replacement 
of the chlorine (Cl) atom in the DMCP structure with −OH groups 
2 O.  The  liberated  Cl − ions  interacted  with  Cu(II)  sites  to 
from  H 
form Cu–Cl bonds (partial collapse of Cu-BTC MOF) [278 , 279] . As

In summary, it can be concluded that there is a considerable 
shortage in the published data on MOF photocatalysis in nuclear 
waste management (radioactive elements). In fact, this limitation 
could  be  attributed  to  many  reasons:  (i)  the  photochemical  re- 
sponse  of  most  MOFs  is  quite  limited  under  solar  light,  (ii)  the 
practical use of MOF photocatalysts in environmental remediation 
is subject to their kinetic stability, and (iii) the high toxicity of nu- 
clear  wastes  and  complicated  restriction/regulation  requirements 
for dealing with this type of radioactive waste. Due to the ﬂexibil- 
ity of MOFs, their molecular structures and textural properties can 
be readily destructed during photocatalytic reactions under normal 
environmental conditions (e.g., after one or two-successive reuse 
cycles). To overcome such limitations, the carbonization process of 
functionalized MOFs has been proposed to form composite semi- 
conductor  photocatalysts  and/or  decoration/coupling  of  pristine 
MOFs with other semiconductors/carbonaceous guest molecules to 
improve their photocatalytic activities and stability (or durability) 
during  environmental  treatment.  Nonetheless,  it  should  also  be 
noted that if the MOF-based composites are constructed to have 
enhanced photochemical stability, it could be attributed to the syn- 
ergistic  contribution  of  inorganic semiconductor  NPs  rather  than 
the enhanced stability of the MOF framework itself (such as Cu- 
BTC MOF in MOFgCNox composite above). It is assumed that the 
porous network and texture properties of MOFs could be signiﬁ- 
cantly reduced as a result of deformation and collapse of frame- 
works (e.g., by the hydrolysis of coordination bonds during redox 
reactions after successive uses). Therefore, future studies should fo- 
cus on the enhancement of photostability of pristine MOFs possibly 
using PSM strategies (e.g., the partial substitution of active metal 
centers with inert transition metal sites, construction of bimetal- 
lic assemblies, and ligand change using imidazolate or porphyrin 
ligand), as discussed later in Section 6 . 

5.2. Photocatalytic oxidation of amines and alcohols 

Ti- and Zr-based MOFs and their composites have been exten- 
sively  used  as  promising catalysts  for  redox  reactions  of  organic 
compounds,  such  as  oleﬁns,  alcohols,  cyclohexanes,  and  hetero- 
cyclics,  with  high  selectivity  and  eﬃciency,  as  seen  in  Table  2S 
(SM).  Among  MOFs,  NH 
2 -MIL-125  was  adopted  due  to  its  high 
photoreaction  rate  (1.13  mmol  g −1  h −1 :  Table  2S)  and  stability 
(up  to  3  cycles)  in  aerobic  oxidation  of  various  benzyl  and  het- 
erocyclic  amines  to  produce  the  corresponding  imine  derivatives 
( Fig. 19 ) under visible irradiation for 12 h [237] . In this pathway 
( Fig. 19 ), a highly active Ti 3 ± center on the MOF catalyst is formed 
upon  irradiation  (Step  1)  due  to  electron  transfer  via  the  LMCT 
mechanism (from NH 
2 -BDC linker to Ti-metal clusters). The photo- 
induced  Ti 3 ± active  center  (acting  as  a  quantum  dot)  can  react

tion suggests that the redox reaction pathway is highly inﬂuenced 
by how electrons affect the chemical stability of the intermediates 
and the steric hindrance of the primary substrates. Aminated UiO- 
6 6 (NH 
2 -UiO-6 6) has been used for enhanced photocatalytic ox- 
idative coupling of various amine substrates to the corresponding 
imine (e.g., photoconversion ranging from 34 to 83% with selectiv- 
ity up to 99%) under visible irradiation [2] . Within this reaction, 
the coupling reaction of heterocyclic amine substrates containing 
S, N, and O heteroatoms occurred in the same oxygenated path-

way as suggested for NH 

It was also reported that NH 

2 -UiO-66 displayed high selectiv- 
ity for the oxidation of various alcohols like 1-hexanol, cyclohex- 
2 -UiO-66 
anol, and 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol [280] . Furthermore, NH 
has been used for the photo-conversion of various substrate alco- 
hols (e.g., p -methyl benzyl alcohol and p -methoxy benzyl alcohol, 
p -chloro  benzyl  alcohol,  p -nitro  benzyl  alcohol,  and  3-methyl-2- 
buten1-ol) to aldehydes under visible light irradiation along with 
the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (8.5 – 63.3% conversion 
− rad- 
and 3 - 99% selectivity) [281] . In this case, the as-formed • O 
2 
icals were an essential part of the oxygenation pathway during the 
photocatalytic oxidation process, as conﬁrmed by electron spin res- 
− radi- 
onance (ESR) analyses. Consequently, a long lifetime of • O 
2 
cals is favorable for improved photo-induced oxygenation reactions 
of C = C and C-H bonds. In contrast, the reduction of Cr(VI) to 
2 -UiO-66 ( ≥95% after 80 min) can proceed in acidi- 
Cr(III) by NH 
ﬁed conditions at a reaction rate of 0.157 mmol g −1 h −1 (Table 1S,

cently suggested as an option to further improve the optical prop- 
erties of NH 
2 -MIL-125 via Schiff-base coupling of aldehydes (e.g., 
2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde  (QUI))  with  amine  functional  ligands 
[282] . Under visible irradiation, the prepared QUI-MIL-125 photo- 
catalyst  showed  an  excellent  photo-oxidation  rate  of  1.73  mmol 
g −1  h −1  (Table 2S) for selective oxidation of different alcohols to 
aldehydes (e.g., ≥ 85% conversion, ≥ 99% selectivity, and 5-cycle 
stability).  The  improved  performance  was  attributed  to  the  ex- 
panded π -delocalized system in the QUI-MIL-125, along with the 
promotion of photo-excited charge carrier separation. These ﬁnd- 
ings agree with the fact that the photocatalytic oxidation perfor- 
mance of MOFs can be improved by tuning their optical properties. 
Inspired  by  catalytic  activities  of  inorganic  semiconductors, 
metal-doped  MOF  composites  (as  multi-components  photocata- 
lysts)  have  been  introduced  to  help  enhance  the  photocatalytic 
oxidation  activities  and  stability  of  bare  MOFs  under  visible  ir- 
radiation.  For  example,  the  exploitation  of  metal  NPs  (e.g.,  Au 
(6 nm), Pd (3 nm), and Pt (3 nm)) in the cavities of MIL-125(Ti) 
led to enhanced visible-driven photo-conversion of benzyl alcohol 
(0.1 mmol) into benzaldehyde (26.5 – 36% conversion) compared 
with pristine MIL-125(Ti) (19% conversion) at 25 °C for 4 h [213] .

dation  process  of  p -methyl  benzyl  alcohol  (PMBA:  0.3  mmol)  to

conversion  eﬃciency  of  PMBA  using  Ni/NH 
2 -MIL-125  was  43.2%, 
with a photo-oxidation rate of 0.65 mmol g −1 h −1 (Table 2S) and 
stability up to three cycles. As such, its eﬃciency was much higher 
2 -MIL-125 (25.8%). The enhanced pho- 
than that of the pristine NH 
tocatalytic  activities  of  all  described  M/NH 
2 -MIL-125  composites 
are  likely  to  reﬂect  the  synergetic  effect  of  metallic  doped  ele- 
ments  (M  =  Pt,  Ni,  Pd,  or  Au)  and  Ti-oxo-clusters,  which  help 
form a Schottky barrier to facilitate photoelectron charge transfer 
via the metal-to-metal mechanism. Thus, the lifetime of photogen- 
erated  carriers  increased  to  improve  photocatalytic  activities.  On 
a comparative note, the reduced conversion eﬃciency by M/MIL- 
2 ) (e.g., relative to QUI-MIL-125) could be explained by im- 
125(NH 
mobilized metal NPs that block microporous cavities of the porous 
MOF  framework.  A  decrease  in  the  micropore  size  of  MOFs  can 
suppress the mass transfer rate of reactant substrates from the re- 
action media to the Ti-oxo cluster active centers (Ti 3 ±active sites); 
hence, photocatalytic eﬃciency can be considerably reduced. 

2 (i.e., rGO/NH 

The oxidation of different aromatic alcohols (e.g. , 4-nitrobenzyl 
alcohol (0.05 mmol), 4-methyl benzyl alcohol (0.5 mmol), and 4- 
ﬂuorobenzyl alcohol (0.5 mmol)) was also tested using a sandwich- 
like hybrid composite made of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with 
UiO-6 6-NH 
2 -UiO-6 6 that showed a photo-oxidation 
rate of 0.47 mmol g −1 h −1 (Table 2S and Fig. 20 (a)) under visible 
light  of λ ≥ 420  nm  [283] .  Accordingly,  the  prepared  rGO/NH 
2 - 
UiO-66  (rGO  =  1.0  wt.%  with  a  QE  of  2.1%)  was  sensitive  to 
the photo-oxidation reactions with conversion eﬃciencies of 18.6–
43.1% and excellent selectivity of 100% at ambient temperature up 
to three cycles. rGO enhanced the charge transfer kinetics and im- 
peded e −/ h ± recombination due to its carrier mobility (i.e. , photo- 
2 -UiO-66 ≈ 1.6 μA/cm 2 ). Meanwhile, the photo- 
current of rGO/NH 
excited  electrons  were  quickly  transferred  through  the  graphene 
layer and converted O 
2 into peroxide, which oxidized the aromatic 
alcohols to carbonium ions. The positive carbonium ions further re- 
acted with peroxide to produce aromatic aldehydes. Likewise, the 
1 wt.% GO encapsulated Eu-MOF (GO/Eu-MOF composite) was syn- 
thesized and tested for photo-oxidation conversion of aromatic al- 
cohol to aldehyde (85.4% conversion under visible irradiation) with 
water as an oxygen source [284] . This hybridization approach pro- 
vided plenty of “quick channels” for photogenerated charge carrier

transfer when building an effective rGO/NH

catalysts and active Lewis-acid sites were also developed via cova- 
2 with pyridine carboxaldehyde (PC), 
lent interactions of UiO-66-NH 
3 • 6H 
followed  by  PSM  using  FeCl 
2 O  dopant  [285] .  The  fabricated 
Zr-MOF-FePC exhibited enhanced photocatalysis and catalytic po- 
tential towards the tandem photooxidative synthesis of α-acyloxy 
amides (TOF 0.29 h −1 ) under UV-irradiation resulting from the ex- 
istence of Zr 4 ±-oxo clusters and Fe 3 ±active sites. The Fe 3 ± is fur- 
ther reduced to Fe 2 ± (Lewis acid). As this reduced form is unstable, 
it reacted with molecular oxygen to form O • − radicals and oxidized 
back  to  Fe 3 ±.  The  formed  O • − radicals  reacted  with  alcohols  to 
form formaldehyde, which reacts with isocyanide and carboxylate 
anions under the effect of Zr 3 ± catalytic sites yielding α-acyloxy 
amides.

face. The incorporation of [SiW 
11 O 
catalyst into the Cu-MOF (Cu-BPY; BPY = 4,4 (cid:8) -bipyridine) frame- 
work  also  facilitated  the  oxidative  coupling  of  C–C  bond  forma- 
tion  [287] .  It  was  found  that  the  loading  of  1  mol%  of  catalyst 
into the Cu-BPY MOF gave rise to a 46% conversion of N-phenyl- 
tetrahydroisoquinoline to acetophenones under visible irradiation. 
This improved photoactivity was ascribed to the direct bridging of 
the Cu metal site (in MOF) and ruthenium (Ru in the catalyst) by 
Cu 2 ±–O–W(Ru). Due to the high redox activities of iron, the poten- 
tial of MIL-100(Fe) has also been recognized in the photocatalytic 
hydroxylation of benzene into phenol (30.6% conversion after 24 h)

5.3. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution 

Fundamentally, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER: Table 3S 
in the SM) depends on the performance of photocatalyst MOFs in 
terms  of  light  absorption  capability,  the  number  of  active  sites, 
charge transfer/separation properties, and bandgap energy [9 , 86] . 
Further, the ability of MOF photocatalysts to produce H 
2 depends 
upon the HOMO and LUMO levels relative to water-splitting po- 
tential energy [86] . As such, photosensitizers and co-catalysts were 
regularly employed to maximize the light harvest capacity of MOF-

[19 , 289] . 

Among  MOF  composites,  phosphorescent  UiO-67  hybridized 
with  iridium  (Ir)  complexes  and  doped  with  Pt  NPs  was  found 
to  exhibit  the  highest  turnover  number  (TON)  during  photocat- 
2 generation (a total Ir-TON of 70 0 0 over 48 h) with good 
alytic H 
stability  up  to  4  cycles  [290] .  The  prepared  UiO-67  framework

prove  visible-light  harvesting,  while  Pt  NPs  played  a  key  role 
in  the  photocatalytic  generation  of  H 
2 .  Upon  irradiation,  the  Ir- 
phosphorescent  moiety  is  excited  to  the  long-lived  3 MLCT  state 
(time-resolved emission lifetime of 51.8 – 110.3 ns). As the pho- 
togenerated {[Ir III (ppy) 
2 )] • −}is an unstable radical species, it 
accelerates the transfer of electrons to the Pt NP catalyst to medi- 
ate proton reduction in the HER process. It is noteworthy that the 
photochemical  quantum  yield  of  the  Pt@Ir-phosphorescent  UiO- 
67 assembly under 440 nm light irradiation was calculated to be 
5.6 × 10 −4 , which is three times higher than the homogenous re- 
action control without MOFs.

on  Ru(bpy)

41 μmol of H 
contrast, the photocatalytic activity of Pt/Ir-phosphorescent UiO-67 
was superior to that of Ru 
2  generation 
2 (1,4-BDC) 
due to the existence of Pt NPs, which improved HER upon the ex- 
citation of visible light. It was thus concluded that the eﬃciency 
of HER by photosensitizer MOFs can be controlled by (1) enhanc- 
ing visible-photon-harvesting and (2) increasing the catalytic activ- 
ity of active sites (e.g., noble metal-based (Pt or Pd) complexes or 
doped semiconductor). The catalytic activity of those doped active 
sites can eﬃciently accelerate H 

2 generation by water splitting.

Among  semiconductor  materials,  cadmium  sulﬁde  (CdS)  has 
been reported for its role in improving MOF capability toward HER. 
Among many studies, 10 wt.% CdS supported MIL-101(Cr) compos-

[291] . The prepared CdS/MIL-101 exhibited high photostability (up

to ﬁve runs) and an H 
which is an almost two-fold enhancement compared to nanoscale 
CdS  photocatalyst  (Table  3S).  During  the  photocatalysis,  pristine 
MIL-101 (Cr III ) acted only as a photosensitizer/antenna to partially 
absorb  irradiated  light  (redox-potential  of  MIL-101  Cr 3 ±/Cr 2 ±)  ≈
±0.49 V). Electrons were then moved from excited MIL-101 (Cr III ∗) 
(redox-potential −1.57 V) to the CB of the CdS semiconductor (re- 
dox potential −0.52 V), which acted as an active catalytic site for 
the generation of H 
2  through a proton reduction reaction (HER). 
CdS is a visible-light-driven photocatalyst that can be excited upon 
photon irradiation, and it directly transfers electrons for HER pro- 
cesses. As such, the enhanced HER is attributed to the microporos- 
ity of MIL-101 (BET 2340 m 2 g −1 (Table 3S), pore size 3.5 nm, and 
pore volume 1.07 cm 3 g −1 ) that allows effective mass transfer and 
uniform encapsulation of CdS (as a reactive catalytic site) within 
the  framework  to  promote  the  visible-light-driven  photocatalytic 
generation of H 

2 . 

The encapsulation of CdS onto UiO-66 was also used to pro- 
mote the HER process under visible irradiation [292] . The CdS/UiO- 
66 (BET of 714.7 m 2  g −1  at 16 wt.% CdS: Table 3S) showed pho- 
2  generation  up  to  16  h,  with  a  higher  HER  rate 
tostability  in  H 
of  47  mmol  g −1  h −1  than  those  of  bare  CdS,  TiO 
2 /CdS,  and  g- 
4 /CdS photocatalysts ( ≈ 22.8, 5, and 4 mmol g −1 h −1 , respec-

tively). In comparison to CdS/ MIL-101, the enhanced H 
2  genera- 
tion over CdS/UiO-66 was explained by the accelerated interfacial 
transfer of electrons from the excited state of CdS to UiO-66, which 
served  as  an  active  site  for  the  HER  process.  This  is  due  to  the 
high reduction potential of the excited state of the UiO-66 photo- 
sensitizer unit than that of the CB of CdS (e.g., redox potential of 
−0.6 V (UiO-66) and −0.9 V (CdS) vs . NHE at pH 7). However, the 
2 over CdS/UiO-66 (47 mmol g −1 
photocatalytic evolution rate of H 
h −1 : QE  = 6.21E-05) was lower than that obtained by CdS/MIL- 
−1  h −1 : QE = 3.96E-05 in Table 3S). The low 
101 (75.5 mmol g 
photocatalytic activity of CdS/UiO-66 could be attributed to its low 
speciﬁc surface area (BET) relative to CdS/MIL-10, which is impor- 
tant in controlling the mass diffusion rate during photocatalysis.

The  PSM  of  MIL-125(Ti)  with  Pt  NPs  and  amine  functional- 
ity was also reported to improve photocatalytic activities of MOF 
2  generation  under  visible  irradiation  [293] .  The  prepared 
for  H 
2 -MIL-125 (BET 742 m 2 g −1 ) was reported as a photo-stable 
Pt/NH 
2  production  (3.67  mmol 
catalyst  (up  to  3  runs)  for  enhanced  H 
h −1 at λ ≥ 420 nm). In contrast, MIL-125 and Pt/MIL-125 showed 
no activity for HER processes under the same conditions (0.01 M 
triethanolamine  (TEOA)  aqueous  solution  at  λ ≥ 420  nm).  This 
likely reﬂects the dependence of HER on the wavelength of light- 
2 moieties, 
harvesting, which is associated with the existence of NH 
2 -MIL-125 (4.5 μmol 
as conﬁrmed by the low H 
h −1  at λ ≥ 420  nm)  [293] .  In  essence,  the  as-prepared  Pt/NH 
2 - 
MIL-125(Ti) can be excited upon visible irradiation to promote the 
catalytic activity of the HER system. Upon excitation, the electron 
2 -MIL-125(Ti) MOF to 
transfer obeyed the LMCT mechanism in NH 
form a Ti 3 ± active site. As a consequence of excitation, the photo- 
induced Ti 3 ± sites were capable of directly transferring the elec- 
trons to Pt for enhanced proton reduction and H

plied for the generation of H 
2 -MIL-125) under visible ( λ = 408 nm) irradi- 
higher than pure NH 
ation ( Fig. 21 ) [203] . This study indicated that there were mecha- 
nistic synergies between the MOF and Co-based proton reduction, 
which enhanced the photocatalytic activity for HER. Although the 
cobaloxime-Ti-MOF  showed  a  stable  turnover  frequency  (TOF)  at 
0.8  h −1  after  65  h  of  irradiation  [74] ,  it  exhibited  moderate  H 
2 
generation  eﬃciency  in  reference  to  Pt/NH2-MIL-125  [293] .  This 
could be attributed to the inferior catalytic activity and stability of 

Co for driving proton reduction compared to Pt. Similarly, Ni/NH

MIL-125 composite was also synthesized by encapsulation of MOF

To  learn  more  about  the  role  of  doped  metal  catalysts,  a 
bimetallic MOF (ZnCo-ZIF) has been proposed as a template for the 
synthesis of various heterojunction photocatalysts with and with- 
out Pt doping (such as ZnO-Co 
4 , and 
Pt-Zn 
2 -CoP) through the pyrolysis process [295] . The activity of 
the heterojunction photocatalysts towards HER was tested under 
visible irradiation in 10 v/v% methanol/aqueous mixtures for 6 h. 
It  was  noted  that  H 
2  generation  rates  of  the  pristine  MOF  tem- 
plates (such as ZIF-67 and ZIF-8) had moderately low values (0.22 
and 0.19 mmol g −1 h −1 , respectively). After pyrolysis, all Pt-doped 
heterojunction photocatalysts (e.g., Pt-ZnS-CoS, Pt-ZnO-Co 
4 , and 
Pt-Zn 
2 -CoP)  were  found  to  exhibit  enhanced  photostability  (5 
cycles)  and  HER  rates  relative  to  ones  without  Pt  doping.  As  a 
good example, the H 
2 - 
4  were as high as 8.21, 9.15, and 7.8 mmol 
CoP, and Pt-ZnO-Co 
g −1 h −1 , respectively, as compared to ZnO-Co 
4 (4.45 mmol g −1 
h −1 ) and pristine ZnO (0.22 mmol g −1 h −1 ). According to the elec- 
trochemical  analyses,  these  Pt-doped  catalysts  demonstrated  the 
fastest electron transfer with the lowest recombination rate among 
all other catalysts without Pt doping. These observations suggest 
that the presence of low overpotential Pt NPs can signiﬁcantly im- 
prove their capacity for H 
2 generation through trapping the pho- 
togenerated electrons on the surfaces of the catalyst under visible 
irradiation. We thus recommend that research on MOF composites 
should  focus  on  the  MOF-derived  heterojunction  structures  with 
matching electronic coupling and abundant surface active sites to 
improve the optical properties and catalytic performance for HER 
in the future.

5.4.1. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) photoreduction 

Photocatalytic  reduction  of  CO 

2  (Table  4S,  see  SM)  is  a  way 
of  mitigating  climate  change  [7 , 296] .  However,  the  photoreduc- 
tion process is mainly dependent on the ability of the photocat- 
2  molecules,  which  is  necessary  for  activating 
alyst  to  adsorb  CO 
electron transfer from the active site to CO 
2  during its reduction 
[18 , 19 , 297] . As such, MOFs have many advantages over other cat- 
alysts/adsorbent materials and provide a new platform for effec- 
tive capture and photocatalytic conversion of CO 
2 in a single-step 
reaction [106] . The unsaturated metal centers (SBUs) in MOFs act 
as Lewis acid sites (partial positive charges; δ±) for both adsorp- 
tion  and  photoreduction  of  CO 
2 .  For  adsorption,  these  SBU  sites 
can offer high selectivity and heat of adsorption ( E = 21 to 90 kJ 
mol −1 ) toward CO 
2 ﬂue gas via stronger electrostatic in- 
teractions due to the higher polarizability (29.1 × 10 −25 cm 3 ) and 
quadrupole moment (4.3 × 10 −26 esu cm 2 ) of CO 
2 compared with 
2  (17.4  × 10 −25  cm 3  and  1.5  × 10 −26  esu  cm 2 ,  respectively) 
N 
[103 , 106] . MOFs can further act as catalytic supports for the ac- 
tive sites via PSM processes that incorporate additional active sites 
that are desirable for enhancing adsorption/catalytic conversion of 
2 . These sites include Lewis basic sites with free functionalities 
CO 
2 group) and sites for the encapsulation of ac- 
of ligands (e.g. , NH 
tive metal species (e.g. , Pt, Pd, Cr, Fe, Ti, or Au) [32] .

According to DFT theory, amine-functionalized MOFs could also 
enhance the adsorption of CO 
2 via a cooperative adsorption mech- 
anism through simultaneous proton transfer/nucleophilic addition 
of  N  on  CO 
2  (chain  reaction:  Fig.  22 (a)),  leading  to  the  forma- 
tion of a carbamate and ammonium counter-cation [298 , 299] . The 
propagation of this cooperative effect will continue to form a one- 
dimensional ammonium carbamate chain to impart the high ad- 
sorption capacity for CO 
2 . Further, the aminated ligand can act as 
an antenna for photon absorption and also as an electron donor for 
the active sites. Under irradiation, the transfer of electrons can take 
place from excited aminated ligands to the CB ( e −
CB ) of SBU sites 
and then to the doped active catalytic center (e.g. , Pt) to induce 
photo-redox reactions. When focusing on upgrading MOF aﬃnity 
for  CO 
2  adsorption  capacity  (Q st )  and  catalytic  conversion,  it  is 
thus important to consider surface area, pore tenability, and larger 
pore volume as they can control the availability of accessible sites 
and/or binding of CO 
2 with the active sites in MOFs [103 , 106 , 300] . 
These  authors  highlighted  the  possible  photocatalytic  conversion 
pathway of CO 
2 over MOF-based photocatalysts ( Fig. 22 (b)). In all 
proposed pathways, high electron mobility (i.e., 2 to 8 e −required) 
and low recombination rate of photo-generated e −/ h ± pairs were 
crucial  in  the  photocatalytic  reduction  of  CO 
2  [32] .  As  such,  the 
band-edge positions and CB reduction potential (i.e. , more negative 
is favorable) can control the photocatalytic conversion pathway. 

For example, NH 

2 -MIL-125 showed higher photocatalytic activ- 
ity towards the reduction of CO 
2  to formate under visible irradi- 
ation  in  the  presence  of  an  electron  donor  like  triethanolamine 
(TEOA) [301] . After 10 h irradiation, the amount of formate con- 
verted reached 8.14 μmol (k = 16.0 μmol g −1 h −1 : Table 4S) over 

2 -MIL-125(Ti) relative to pristine MIL-125(Ti) with a negligible 
NH 
conversion. These authors suggested that NH 
2 -BDC ligands acted 
as antennas to absorb visible light, while such sensitivity towards 
visible light was not observed in pristine BDC ligands (UV-active 
2 -BDC ligands to 
ligand). The electron migrations from excited NH 
Ti-oxo-clusters (Ti 4 ±) led to the formation of Ti 3 ±active sites via 
the  LMCT  mechanism  (Scheme  in  Fig.  22 (c)).  The  photo-induced 
Ti 3 ± sites transferred excess electrons to the adsorbed CO 
2 for re- 
duction,  while  Ti 3 ±was  oxidized  back  to  Ti 4 ±.  The  encapsulation 
2 -MIL-125(Ti)  with  noble  metal  NPs  (Pt-  and  Au-  NPs,  as 
of  NH 
electron  trap:  Table  4S)  was  also  tested  to  prove  the  enhanced 
activation of the redox sites for CO 
2  reduction to formate in the 
presence of TEOA [302 , 303] . Over 8 h visible irradiation, the mea- 
sured formate was found to decrease in the order of Pt/NH 
2 -MIL- 
2 −MIL-125  (26.3 μmol  g −1  h −1 ) 
125  (32.4 μmol  g −1  h −1 )  ≥ NH 
2 −MIL-125 (22.5 μmol g −1 h −1 ), as presented in Table 4S 
≥ Au/NH 
(SM). Besides, both Pt- and Au- doped NH 
2 -MIL-125(Ti) exhibited a 
2 evolution rate ≈ 0.56 and 100 μmol 
synergetic effect for HER (H 
g −1  h −1 , respectively), which promoted CO 
2  reduction to a large 
2 -MIL-125 may be respon- 
extent. The catalytic inferiority of Pt/NH 
sible for the hydrogen spillover mechanism over Pt NPs (acting as 
redox sites) along with a stronger Pt-O bond (391.6 kJ mol −1 ) than 
that of Au-O bonds (221.8 kJ mol −1 ) within the framework [79] .

According to DFT, the dissociative energy for chemisorbed H 
Pt NPs is thermodynamically viable (1.1 and 0.18 eV for one and 
2  molecules). As such, the spillover of H atoms from Pt to 
two H 
2 -MIL-125 led to the reduction of Ti-O oxo-clusters to form 
the NH 
the Ti 3 ± site, which was required for the photo-reduction of CO 
2 . 
The occurrence of Ti 3 ± sites in Pt/NH 
2 -MIL-125 was also conﬁrmed

and  4.8  wt.%  Ti)  exhibited  highly  stable  photocatalytic  activity 
with  a  TON  value  of  6.27  ± 0.23  over  three  cycles  (6  h  each; 
Fig. 14 (b)), which is higher than that obtained by a single ligand 
2 -UiO-66(Zr/Ti) (TON = 4.66 ± 0.17). In contrast, although both 
NH 
bare and mixed ligand UiO-66(Zr)-NH 
2 (without Ti exchange) are 
capable  of  UV-visible  light  absorption  (band  edges  λmax  at  464 
and  503  nm),  none  of  them  exhibited  photocatalytic  reduction 
activity (no formate formation). The 13 C NMR spectrum ( Fig. 14 (c)) 
also  proves  the  effectiveness  of  1(Zr/Ti)MOF  toward  photocat- 
alytic  reduction  of  CO 
2  to  form  HCOOH  as  compared  with  bare 
Zr-MOF  [85 , 185] .  Accordingly,  the  optical  properties  of  mixed 
ligands  within  1(Zr/Ti)  MOF  is  not  a  critical  factor  in  enhancing 
photocatalytic performance. Instead, the existence of the Ti-active 
site  is  crucial  for  CO 
2  reduction.  Based  on  the  energy  bandgap 
( Fig.  14 (a)),  a  strategy  of  using  mixed  amine  ligands  in  1(Zr/Ti) 
MOF  is  favorable  for  the  construction  of  two  energy  levels  for 
more  photon  absorption  (up  to  748  nm).  Upon  excitation,  the

Recently, six types of Co-based MOFs were synthesized to study 
the inﬂuence of coordination environments of metal sites to facil- 
itate the photoconversion of CO 
2 to CO under visible-light condi- 
tions [307] . These authors reported that the Co-MOFs containing 
μ-OH − ligands exhibited high selectivity (98.2%) toward the photo- 
−1 
conversion of CO 
h −1 :  Table  4S)  with  a  TOF  up  to  0.059  s −1 .  An  isotope  labeling 
study and DFT calculation elucidated that the existence of neigh- 
boring μ-OH − groups served as hydrogen-bonding donors during 
adsorption  to  stabilize  the  adsorbed  CO 
2  onto  the  Co-metal  site 
2 )  and  as  a  source  for  local  protons  during 
in  the  MOF  (Co-CO 
photocatalysis to promote O = C-O bond dissociation. A rod-like 
Ag NP encapsulated Co-ZIF-9 was also reported for the photocat- 
alytic reduction of CO 
2 to CO under visible irradiation [235] . After 
30  min  of  irradiation,  Ag@Co-ZIF-9  MOF  was  found  to  exhibit  a 
two-fold enhancement in photocatalytic performance with a rate 
of 5.68 × 10 4 μmol g −1 h −1 and an excellent photostability (up to 
3 cycles) in reference to pristine Co-ZIF-9 (no activity).

Accordingly,  the  enhanced  photocatalytic  reduction  was  ex- 
plained  by  the  possible  electron  trap  effect  by  doped  Ag  NPs, 
which accelerated electron transfer to CO 
2  during photocatalysis. 
Furthermore, Fe@C core/shell nanocomposites fabricated from py- 
rolysis of Fe-MIL-101 were applied for eﬃcient adsorption and cat- 
alytic conversion of CO 
2  into CO [308] . Due to the local surface-

5.4.2. Nitrogen (N 2 ) photoreduction 

Nitrogen  (N 

2  ≈ 78  vol.%  in  the  Earth’s  atmosphere)  is  an 
essential  precursor  for  synthesizing  ammonia  (NH 
3 ),  which 
is  utilized  as  a  raw  chemical  in  many  applications  including 
agriculture  (nitrogen-based  fertilizers),  fuel  production  (energy 
carrier/renewable fuel), and medicine (nucleotides and amino acids 
synthesis)  [310 , 311] .  From  a  thermodynamic  viewpoint,  the  en- 
dothermic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to NH 
3 is accessible

( N 
99 KJ mol −1 K −1 )  [312] .  However,  from  a  practical  viewpoint,  the 
direct  reduction  of  N 
3  is  extremely  diﬃcult  due  to 
its  chemical  inactivity  (N ≡N),  high  stability  (large  energy  gap 
(22.9  eV)  between  HOMO  ( σ g  2p)  and  LUMO  ( π g 
∗2p)  orbitals), 
high dissociation barrier (941 kJ mol −1 ), negative electron aﬃnity 
( −1.8 eV), and the absence of a permanent dipole [312 , 313] .

To  date,  the  industrial  production  of  NH 

2  still  re- 
lies  on  the  thermocatalytic  hydrogenation  process  developed  by 
Haber-Bosch in the early 1900s. This thermocatalytic process in- 
volves the cleavage of N ≡N bonds over iron or ruthenium-based 
catalysts under high pressure/temperature (15–30 MPa and 400–
500  °C).  Notably,  this  thermocatalytic  process  has  many  draw- 
backs in terms of low eﬃciency (10–15%), high energy consump- 
tion (1–2% of global annual supply), and high emission of green- 
house  gas  (2.3  tons/year)  [313] .  Detailed  explanations  about  the 
Haber-Bosch process can be found elsewhere in other review pa- 
pers  [314-316] .  To  overcome  the  limitations  of  this  thermocatal- 
ysis process, the ﬁxation of N 
3  (nitrogen reduction reac- 
tion: NRR) by photocatalysis has recently attracted widespread at- 
2 to 
tention [310] . The heterogeneous photocatalytic NRR process (N

near  ambient  conditions.  As  compared  to  photon-induced  water 
splitting (HER), the photon-driven NRR mechanism involves a se- 
ries  of  photocatalytic  redox  reactions  (e.g.,  water  oxidation  fol- 
lowed by NH 
3 synthesis), as presented in Eqs. (25)–(31) based on 
DFT  calculations  [312 , 317] .  The  detailed  fundamental  mechanism 
for photocatalytic NRR can be found elsewhere. As is well-known, 
these photoredox reactions largely depend on the reduction poten- 
tial of both N 
2 O molecules (E ° (V) vs. NHE) and the energy 
band ( e −/ h ± energy transfer mechanism) in the utilized catalysts. 
It is thus important to develop effective photocatalysts (e.g., with 
catalytic centers having small bandgap, long-lived e −/ h ± pairs, high 
electron  density,  and  high  adsorption/activation  ability  for  N ≡N 
bonds (nitrogen vacancies)) to satisfy the thermodynamic NRR pro- 
cess of N 
3 under solar light with a high apparent QE value 
[318] .

Notably, numerous efforts have recently been reported for the 
photocatalytic reduction of N 
3 over a wide range of semi- 
2 to NH 
conducting  catalysts  (e.g.,  metal-oxides,  hydrous  oxides,  metal- 
sulﬁdes,  organo-metallic,  and  composites)  [312 , 318-320 ].  Com- 
pared with other semiconducting photocatalysts, to the best of our 
knowledge, only a few publications have recently been made for 
the utilization of MOF-based photocatalysts in NRR. This could be 
attributed  to  the  low  kinetic  stability  of  MOFs  in  aqueous  me- 
dia  and  the  high  bond  energy  of  N ≡N  (i.e.,  hard  for  cleavage 
and hydrogenation at room temperature). Table 4S lists some of 
the recent studies for the utilization of MOF-based photocatalysts 
in the NRR process. For example, four MIL series materials (e.g., 
MIL-101(Cr), MIL-101(Fe), MIL-88(Fe), and MIL-100(Fe)) were syn- 
thesized  and  tested  for  photocatalytic  NRR  at  80  mL  min −1  N 
2 
ﬂow  in  aqueous  solution  under  visible  irradiation  for  1  h  [313] . 
Accordingly, Cr-based MOF (e.g., MIL-101(Cr)) is an inactive pho- 
tocatalyst  for  the  NRR  process  (zero  activity).  On  a  comparative 
note,  all  Fe-based  MIL  series  materials  exhibited  high  photocat- 
±,  with  a  descending  order 
alytic  reduction  rates  for  N 
2  to  NH 
4 
of MIL-101(Fe) (50.36 μmol L −1 h −1 ) ≥ MIL-100(Fe) (46.53 μmol 
L −1  h −1 )  ≥ MIL-88(Fe)  (40.04  μmol  L −1  h −1 ).  These  results  in- 
dicated  the  key  role  of  Fe  metal  catalytic  sites  during  the  NRR 
process  (N ≡N  adsorption/activation  to  NH 
3 ).  Quantum  computa- 
tions  showed  that  MIL-101(Fe)  had  a  higher  N 
2  sorption  energy 
( −0.48 eV) and lower reaction energy barrier ( (cid:3)G ≈ 1.3 eV) than 
MIL-101(Cr) with (cid:3)G ≈ 1.8 eV. Further, the computed charge den- 
sity difference indicated that MIL-101(Fe) had concentrated elec- 
2  molecule, while MIL-101(Cr) exhib- 
trons at the Fe sites and N 
2 molecules. Given

2  ad- 
sorbed  onto  MIL-101(Fe)  to  generate  more  N-H  bonds.  As  such, 
MIL-101(Fe) showed excellent photocatalytic activity towards NRR 
than  that  of  MIL-101(Cr)  analog.  Within  the  MIL-101(Fe)  coordi- 
nated  framework,  the  LUMO  electron  density  of  Fe  metal  node 
can increase by a back donation of metal d–p electrons, followed 
by the depletion of the HOMO electron density [321 , 322] . These 
LUMO  electrons  can  be  donated  into  the π anti-bond  orbital  of

Another group recognized that the Ti

tron  donation  sites  for  enhanced  dissociation/hydrogenation  re- 
duction  of  N ≡N  bonds  (Table  4S)  [323] .  In  this  case,  a  series 
of  isostructural  MIL-125  (Ti)  photocatalysts  were  prepared  using 
functionalized BDC linkers (-OH, -CH 
2  groups) to pro- 
mote NRR under visible irradiation ( λ ≥ 450 nm) relative to pris- 
tine MIL-125(Ti), which is already a well-known photoactive cat- 
alyst under UV light only [323] . Among these functionalized MIL- 
2 -MIL-125 (Ti) was found to 
125(Ti) series materials (Table 4S), NH 
exhibit the highest photocatalytic conversion rate for N 
2  to NH 
3 
(12.3 μmol g −1 h −1 ) in the aqueous medium. The high NRR rate 
of  NH 
2 -MIL-125  (Ti)  can  be  explained  in  terms  of  the  presence 
of amine functionality (as an electron-donating group, See Fig. 3 ). 
This  amine  functionality  promoted  (i)  the  extension  of  visible- 
photon harvesting range up to 550 nm (E g = 2.88 eV) and (ii) do- 
nation of electrons to the Ti-oxo clusters (Ti 4 ±→ Ti 3 ±) for adsorp- 
tion/reduction of N

MIL-125  (Ti)  were  reduced  to  Ti 3 ± by  transferring  photoexcited 
electrons from NH 
2 -BDC ligands to Ti-clusters through the LMCT 
mechanism. Subsequently, the photogenerated electrons were di- 
rectly injected into the antibonding π -orbitals of the chemisorbed 
2  on the Ti 3 ± sites via electron donation/electron exchange re- 
N 
actions [323 , 324] . This step led to the reproduction of a Ti 4 ±-azo 
complex  with  an  end-on  bridging  mode.  Such  electron  injection

tion. As the aqueous solution was replaced with DMF solvent, the

performance of NH 
(no detection for ammonia) [323] . This proved that the complete

6. Applicability of MOF photocatalysts based on their 
thermodynamic/kinetic stability and market penetrability 

6.1. Development of thermodynamically/kinetically stable MOF 
photocatalyst products 

Over the past two decades, almost all the studies on MOFs have 
focused on the development of new synthesis procedures to pro- 
vide diverse structural properties for potential utilization in various 
ﬁelds. Nonetheless, the poor chemical, thermal, and hydrothermal 
stabilities of MOFs structures (relative to inorganic porous mate- 
rials)  in  liquid  (acid/alkaline  conditions)  and  gas  (at  high  vapor 
pressure/temperature) reactions are often the most critical factors 
that limit their viable exploitation in industrial applications. The 
kinetic  stability  of  MOFs  is  inﬂuenced  by  a  number  of  variables 
(such as the strength of coordination bond between organic linker 
and metal node, chemical functionality of a linker, and dimension- 
ality/ﬂexibility of the frameworks) [325] . 

It is known that the kinetic stability of MOFs is mainly depen- 
dent on the strength of coordination bonds, which are regulated 

by the nature and oxidation state of the metal (M) node and the 
properties of the ligand (L). In terms of the metal nodes, the chem- 
ical/thermal stabilities of three isotypic MIL-series materials (i.e., 
MIL-53-Al,  MIL-53-Cr,  and  MIL-47-V)  with  different  metal  nodes 
(e.g.,  Al(III),  Cr(III),  and  V  (III/IV))  have  been  tested  in  acid,  al- 
kaline,  and  water  solutions  [326] .  The  results  revealed  the  poor 
chemical stability of MIL-47-V (oxidation state of V is ±4) in al- 
kaline  (0.07  mM  NaOH)  or  acidic  (0.07  mM  HCl)  solutions.  No- 
tably, MIL-47-V was completely dissolved/dissociated after 6 h in 
acid/alkaline media at room temperature (or at 80 °C in neutral 
water with pH 6.7). The BET surface area and crystallinity of MIL- 
53-Al  were  also  reduced  steadily  with  increasing  time  of  treat- 
ment in acidic/alkaline conditions (7.7% dissociation after 3 h in 
acid). Accordingly, it is not recommended to utilize MIL-47-V and 
MIL-53-Al for environmental/energy applications (adsorption and 
photocatalysis) in aqueous media. In contrast, MIL-53-Cr exhibited 
superior stability with no noticeable change in the BET and XRD 
data when treated in alkaline (for 6 h) and acidic (for 48 h) solu- 
tions at room temperature. Upon hydrothermal treatment, the TGA 
data revealed that the thermal stability of MIL-53-Al was far higher 
( ≥ 500 °C)  than those of  MIL-53-Cr and MIL-47-V  ( ≤ 400 °C). 
Considering the coordination bond strength, the chemical/thermal 
stability  of  those  isotypic  MIL-series  cannot  be  explained  sim- 
ply based on the bond dissociation energy as the strength of the 
metal-oxygen bonds was in the order of Cr-O (461 kJ mol −1 ) ≤ Al- 
O (502 kJ mol −1 ) ≤ V-O (637 kJ mol −1 ). On the other hand, the 
relative order of the chemical stabilities of those MIL-series mate- 
rials were well-correlated with that of the kinetic inertness (or de- 
creasing lability) of the metal ions: Cr(III) ≥ Al(III) ≥ V(III) ≥ V(IV) 
[327] . 

Such a hypothesis was also veriﬁed by the enhanced chemical 
stability of PCN-333 MOFs via the replacement of Fe(III) metal cen- 
ters  with  Cr(III)  ions  to  build  mesoporous  PCN-333-Cr(III)  [328] . 
The produced PCN-333-Cr(III) exhibited very high stability in acidic 
(pH0) or alkaline (pH 11) conditions for 24 h (without crystallinity 
loss) compared with PCN-333-FE(IIII), which showed moderate sta- 
bility  at  pH  3.0  – 9.0  only.  This  is  likely  to  reﬂect  the  effect  of 
the low ligand substitution/hydrolysis rate of the kinetically inert 
Cr–O coordination complex ( k = 2.4 × 10 −6 s −1 ) in aqueous solu- 
tion relative to other MOFs based on trivalent metal centers (e.g., 
6 3 ±, 
6 3 ±, 1.6 × 10 2  s −1  for Fe(OH 
k = 8.7 × 10 1  s −1  for V(OH 
2 ) 
and 1.8 × 10 5 s −1 for Ti(OH 
6 3 ±) [329] . Similarly, the inert coor- 
2 ) 
dination complex using Ir(III) metal ions was found to have a much 
lower ligand exchange rate ( k = 1.1 × 10 −11 s −1 ) than that of inert 
Cr(III)-based complexes ( Fig. 23 a) [329] . As such, the chemical sta- 
bility of MOFs can be improved via reductive labilization of metal 
centers to lower the ligand exchange rate ( Fig. 23 b). In general, the 
use  of  kinetically  inert  metal  ions  (such  as  Cr(III),  Ru  (III/IV),  Pt 
(III), and Ir(III)) can be an effective option to produce exceptionally 
robust MOF with greater stability through the synthesis of new or 
modiﬁed MOF-based photocatalysts for environmental/energy ap- 
plications ( Fig. 23 a,b) [330] . 

2 ) 

The kinetic stability of MOFs based on metal-carboxylate clus- 
ters  can  also  be  predicted  by  considering  the  relative  strength 
of  M-O  bonds  in  their  corresponding  metal  oxides  ( Table  3 ). 
In  Table  3 ,  the  M-O  bond  strengths  for  the  ﬁrst-row  transi- 
tion  metal  oxides  were  found  to  decrease  in  the  order  of  FeO 
(468 kJ.mol −1 ) ≥ CrO (374 kJ.mol −1 ) ≥ CuO (372 kJ.mol −1 ) ≥ ZnO 
(365  kJ.mol −1 )  [325 , 331] .  Based  on  this  concept,  it  can  be  sug- 
gested  that  HKUST-1  (with  CuO  cluster)  had  higher  moisture- 
stability  in  reference  to  MOF-5  (with  ZnO  cluster).  In  con- 
trast,  MIL-101-Cr  should  show  much  higher  hydrothermal  sta- 
bility  than  HKUST-1  due  to  the  existence  of  trivalent  Cr  clus- 
3 at 465 kJ.mol −1 ) rather than 
ters (Cr 
of  the  divalent  Cr(II)  form.  In  fact,  it  was  also  noted  that  the 
MOFs  with  the  octahedral  coordination  environment  were  ther-

Fig. 23.  Strategies for the enhancing the kinetic stability of MOFs with respect to the activation energy barrier (Ea): (a) reducing metal-aquo exchange rate, (b) increasing 
the inertness of the metal ion to increase the activation energy barrier for dense phase formation, (c) use of donating azolate ligands with inert transition metals (stronger 
M-O bonds), and (d) increasing the heterolytic metal-ligand bond strength to increase the activation energy barrier for a bond-breaking transition state without affecting the 
net driving force for the transition towards the dense phase ( (cid:3)G = change in the Gibbs free energy; DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide; Ln = lanthanide). Reprinted from [330] with

modynamically stable over those with tetrahedral geometries. This 
is  likely  to  reﬂect  the  formation  of  energetically  favorable  hexa- 
coordinate complexes between one metal cluster and six-ligands 
in the inner coordination sphere. Such coordination environments 
led  to  a  reduction  in  the  net  positive  charge  on  the  metal  cen- 
ters (i.e., disfavor of charge transfer from water to metal) and to 
decrease  the  available  space  for  the  barrier  of  water  molecules 
(e.g., decrease in the kinetic rate for ligand exchange) [332] . How- 
ever, it should be noted that the dynamic association-dissociation 
equilibrium of ligands toward the reaction of water was not con- 
sidered in this concept. In other words, this hypothesis was con- 
ﬁrmed by comparing MOF materials with the same ligand struc- 
ture.  For  example,  the  MIL-53  series  MOFs  (e.g.,  MIL-53-Al  and 
MIL-53-Cr)  consist  of  corner-shared  M 3 ± octahedral  SBU  coordi- 
nated  to  the  BDC  ligand  to  form  inﬁnite  chains  of  1D  lozenge- 
shaped pores [325] . A comparison between two isostructural MOFs 
indicated  that  MIL-53-Al  had  higher  hydrothermal  stability  than 
MIL-53-Cr in the presence of high vapor steam (25–50%) and tem- 
perature (up to 350 °C). This is likely to reﬂect the effect of the 
higher bonding strength of Al-O over Cr-O in their corresponding 

metal oxides clusters, as seen in Table 3 . Accordingly, Cr-MIL-53 
can maintain much lower activation energy (30.4 kcal • mol −1 ) for 
the displacement of BDC ligand with water than that of Al-MIL-53 
(43.5 kcal • mol −1 ).

Based on the crystal ﬁeld stabilization energy (CFSE), the de- 
gree of coordination stability for transition metal complexes can 
vary  widely  across  varying  electronic  (d-orbitals)  conﬁgurations: 
d 3 ,  d 8  >  d 4 ,  d 9  >  d 2 ,  d 7  >  d 1 ,  d 6  >  d 0 ,  d 5 ,  d 10  [333] .  For  in- 
stance, the copper paddlewheel SBU [Cu 2 ±: d 9 conﬁguration] pos- 
sesses a ligand ﬁeld stabilization energy to improve chemical sta- 
bility  and  shelf-life  of  HKUST-1  in  aqueous  media  over  MOF-5 
4 -O) SBU, d 10  conﬁguration] regardless of the coordination 
[Zn 
environment [334 , 335] . Upon thermal activation of HKUST-1, the 
axial water coordinated to hydrated Cu-clusters will be removed 
to  form  a  stable  square  planar  coordination  geometry.  As  such, 
the stability Zn-based MOFs (e.g., PCN-921) can be improved via a 
single-crystal-to-single-crystal metal exchange of Zn by Cu ions to 
form PCN-922(Cu) isostructures with greater thermodynamic sta- 
bility [336 , 337] . On this basis, post-metalation and metal-exchange 
processes have also been employed to strengthen the coordination

bonds and to produce highly stable MOFs. Note that these MOFs 
are not easy to prepare directly using in-situ synthesis methodolo- 
gies [338] . 

To address how competing effects (e.g., between ligand (L) and 
metal ion (M)) inﬂuence the kinetic stability of the MOF frame- 
works, the hydrothermal stabilities of various MOFs (e.g., IRMOF- 
1, MOF-69C, Zn-MOF-74, MOF-508b, HKUST-1, Cr-MIL-101, Al-MIL- 
110,  Al-MIL-53,  and  ZIF-8:  Fig.  24 (a-e))  have  also  been  assessed 
based  on  experimental  and  molecular  modeling  upon  treatment 
with  dry  and  vapor-containing  (2–50%)  steams  at  different  tem- 
peratures (25–350 °C) [325] . In this respect, it was found that the 
decomposition of MOF frameworks could involve ligand hydrolysis 
and/or displacement of the reaction with water molecules (MOF: 
M-L ± H 
2 ••• L). 
Fig.  24  (a-d)  shows  that  such  coordination  interactions  between 
the metal clusters and water molecules involves hydrogen bond- 
ing with a proton pointing at the displaced O-atom in the transi- 
tion state of the COO − (i.e., ligand coordination changed from η2 
to η1 bonding) and the oxygen coordinated to the metal. This al- 
teration in the metal-carboxylate coordination bond was helpful in 
reducing the activation/reaction energy (e.g., 11.6, 28.9, 30.5, 35.8, 
42.0, and 43.4 kcal mol −1 for MOF-5, HKUST-1, MIL-53-Cr, MIL-101, 
MOF-74, and MIL-53-Al, respectively) during the ligand displace- 
ment/hydrolysis reactions by water molecules.

2 O → M-(OH) 

Quantum mechanical calculations of clusters showed that ZIF- 
8 has superior hydrothermal stability among all the above-tested 
carboxylate-based  MOFs  with  high  activation  energies  for  ligand 
displacement (~55.7 kcal mol −1 ) ( Fig. 24 e). Although the SBUs of 
ZIF-series  showed  a  tetrahedrally-coordinated  environment,  their 
superior hydrothermal stability may be accounted for by imidazo- 
late ligands, which is coordinatively η1 bonded to the metal center 
(e.g., Zn in ZIF-8). Such coordinative η1 bonds need high activation

energy (relative to η2 bonding of carboxylate ligand) to decompose 
during the ligand displacement/hydrolysis reactions [325] . Accord- 
ingly, the utilization of rigid , imidazolate/azolate-based ligands (or 
amine-based linkers; Fig. 23 c-d) is recognized as an effective op- 
tion for improving the hydrothermal stability of the MOF frame- 
works  for  industrial  applications  due  to  its  ability  to  strengthen 
the  coordination  bonds  (e.g.,  η1  bonded  to  the  metal  centers) 
[330 , 339 , 340] . Using the DFT and calorimetric measurements, the 
energetics of several ZIFs materials have been computed at 25 °C 
in alkaline solutions (5 M NaOH), as listed in Table 4 and Fig. 25 a 
[340 , 341] . Accordingly, the experimental observations revealed the 
exothermic nature of enthalpies for all ZIF solutions ( (cid:3)H s ). In ad- 
dition, the energetics ( (cid:3)H trans ) of all ZIFs showed relatively nar- 
row  ranges  of  values  of  13.0  to  27.2  kJ.mol −1  Zn,  although  the 
porosity  of  MOFs  increased  by  a  factor  of  two  (from  135.9  to 
248.8 cm 3 • mol −1 ).  Also,  the thermodynamic stability of  ZIFs de- 
creases (with higher enthalpy energy) with increases in the frame- 
work porosity or with decreases in framework density. This ther- 
mochemical  evidence  veriﬁes  the  modest  metastability  of  ZIFs. 
Nonetheless, it should be noted that the thermodynamic stability 
of  ZIFs  can  be  improved  as  the  framework  density  decreases  to 
become a non-porous amorphous phase ( Fig. 25 b) [330 , 342] . The 
transition of MOFs from porous to amorphous denser phases (e.g., 
MOF-5 and ZIF-4) was found to be an eﬃcient option to achieve 
thermodynamic stability when carried out at low or high compres- 
sion pressures (3.5 MPa – 2 GPa) [343-347] . However, the forma- 
tion of the denser MOF phase is still diﬃcult to conceptualize be- 
cause of the directionality of the ligands in the network structures 
[330] . 

In terms of metal cluster reactivity, HKUST-1 shows better hy- 
drothermal stability than MOF-5 upon reaction with water. How- 
ever,  both  HKUST-1  and  MOF-5  exhibited  poor  chemical  stabil-

ity  when  they  were  exposed  to  gas-phase  interactions  with  re- 
duced sulfur compounds (e.g., H 
2 S inter- 
acted with the unsaturated polynuclear metal clusters of HKUST- 
1  and  MOF-5  to  form  Cu-S  and  Zn-S  chemical  bonds,  respec- 
tively, followed by high exothermic reaction (cid:3)H rx of −535 to −532 
kJ • mol −1 (relative to the (cid:3)H rx of H 
2 O with Cu/Zn metal sites: 51 
kJ • mol −1 ) [348] . These chemically formed bonds (Cu-S or Zn-S) are 
strong enough to decompose the octahedral coordination frame- 
works  along  with  the  liberation  of  free  carboxylate  ligands  (i.e., 
collapsed frameworks). On a comparative note, the Zr-based frame- 
work (UiO-66) was found to exhibit high chemical stability toward 
the gas-phase reaction with H 
2 S due to the occurrence of a fully 
coordinated metal site (C.N = 12, 8, and 6). In fact, most Zr-MOFs 

(e.g., UiO-66, PIZOF-1, PCN-521, PCN-225, PCN-224, and PCN-222) 
were demonstrated to have high thermodynamic stability during 
the reaction in gaseous and dielectric media [113 , 349-351 ]. Addi- 
tionally, Zr-metal ions are recommended as attractive low-cost el- 
ements with high abundance when designing new MOF structures 
for catalytic/adsorbent applications [352] . 

The  kinetic/thermodynamic  stability  of  MOFs  should  be  con- 
sidered  as  a  key  parameter  in  controlling  the  rates  of  ligand 
isomerization  and  phase  crystallization  (phase  transition)  during 
solvothermal  synthesis,  especially  under  high-temperature  con- 
ditions  [353] .  More  speciﬁcally,  it  was  reported  that  the  hy- 
dration  and  coordination  connectivity  between  the  tartrate  lig- 
and  and  Mg(II)  metal  ion  decreased  with  increasing  tempera-

MOFs  structures  coincides  with  the  phase  transition  of  tartaric 
acid (C 
D, L ), and meso ) 
L  and 
with increasing hydrothermal temperature conditions. The calori- 
metric/computational  analyses  have  also  been  explored  to  eluci- 
date the role of kinetic/thermodynamic factors in controlling phase 
transitions (13 phases) of tartrate-based MOFs when using other 
alkaline  earth  metal  ions  (e.g.,  Ca(II),  Sr(II),  and  Ba(II))  as  metal 
centers [355] . For instance, the use of Ba(II) and Sr (II) as metal 
centers can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the phase transition of the re- 
sulting MOFs due to their effect on the isomerization/racemization 
of tartrate ligand upon the hydrothermal reaction at high temper- 
ature [355] . The hydration and coordination connectivity followed 
the same thermodynamic trends as the Mg(II)-tartrate framework, 
with the formation of thermodynamically stable condensed struc- 
tures  as  the  temperature  rose  to  220  °C  (i.e.,  dehydration  pro- 
cess). In general, dense structures are favored in crystal chemistry 
( Fig. 23 b) because they facilitate the construction of well-known 
crystalline materials with good topologies and suﬃcient porosity 
for practical (industrial) applications [330 , 356] . 

Based on total electronic energies and enthalpies analyses, the 
anhydrous Ca- and Sr-polymorphs with meso -tartrate ligand were 
more thermodynamically stable (9.1 to 13.4 kJ mol −1 ) than their 
chiral polymorphs (2.9 to 8.1 kJ • mol −1 ) at all tested temperature 
ranges (25 −220 °C). On the other hand, the chiral analog of Ba(II)- 
tartrate was more thermodynamically stable at low temperatures, 
while it was the racemic [Ba( 
D,L -tartrate)] phase at high temper- 
ature  (6.4  to  7.0  kJ • mol −1 ).  The  ﬁndings  of  this  phase  transition 
between tartrate-based MOF products with temperature conditions 
suggest that the thermodynamic control of the synthetic reaction 
via the entropic release of water is a key driving factor in deter- 
mining the phase stability [357] . Based on DFT calculations, it is 
evident that thermodynamic stability and the phase transition of 
lithium- tartrate frameworks are a key factor in several variables 
(e.g., solvent, reactant ligand (isomers), and temperature: Fig. 26 ) 
during the synthesis process [357] . In this case, the thermodynam- 
ically stable Li 
2 (tartrate) MOF products were produced with the in- 
creases in the solvent polarity (in a water/ethanol) and tempera- 
ture. In addition, the metastable polymorphs can be replaced with 
more stable phases by increasing the temperature (above 180 °C). 
Based on the above, it can be concluded that the phase tran- 
sitions  and  thermodynamic  stability  of  MOFs  are  greatly  inﬂu- 
enced by the applied synthetic conditions and the physicochemi- 
cal nature of the reactants (i.e., the dimensionality of SBUs, metal- 
ligand connectivity, the oxidation state of metal centers, and sta- 
bility/reactivity of metal clusters themselves during applications). 
Fundamentally,  the  strength  of  the  Lewis  acid/base  coordination 
bonds of metals and ligands dictates the chemical stability of MOF 
photocatalysts based on  the  soft/hard acid/base principle (HSAB) 
[79 , 358] . In this case, encapsulation of co-catalysts as guest species 
(e.g., noble NPs, metal oxides NPs, carbon nanomaterials, sensitiza- 
tion, metal ions, and other functional materials) within the frame- 
work has been suggested as a viable route of PSM (see Section 4 ) 
to promote photo-generated charge separation while increasing the 
chemical  stability  and  reactivity  of  photocatalytic  sites  on  MOFs 
[17] . Coordination between hard bases such as carboxylate-ligands 
with hard acid metals (e.g. , Zr(IV), Al(III), Ti(IV), Cr(III), and Fe(III)) 
is also an effective option for designing stable MOFs in the aquatic 
environment. For example, the coordination between Ti (IV)-oxo- 
clusters  (a  general  formula  Ti n O m ( OH ) x ( COOR ) y )  and  BDC  ligands 
was  reported  to  offer  a  viable  means  for  assembling  chemically 
stable six-coordinated Ti-MOF (MIL-125(Ti)) photocatalysts without 
losing their crystallinity [79] . However, the use of the UV-driven 
MIL-125 (3.6 eV; 345 nm) cannot be realized as a practical option

for  solar-driven  photocatalysis  because  the  majority  of  the  sun- 
light lies within the Vis/NIR region (~ 40% visible light and ~ 54% 
NIR).  Such  limitations  can  be  avoided  by  adopting  three  routes: 
(i) acceleration of the accessibility of reactants through the inte- 
rior active sites (i.e., the formation of mesoporous MOFs), (ii) an 
increase in the redox potential of metal centers as the main ac- 
tive catalytic sites (i.e., constructing heterometal clusters), and (iii) 
enhancement  of  the  catalytic  reaction  rates  both  on  the  surface 
and inside the pores of MOFs (i.e., defect engineering). However, 
it should be noted that it is also important to reduce the possi- 
ble loss of energy (i.e., the ratio between dissipated energy by the 
photo-redox reactions to the energy of the absorbed photon upon 
irradiation) to improve MOF quantum eﬃciency during photocatal- 
ysis [79 , 83] . This can be resolved by reducing the intermolecular 
energy transfer ( e −/ h ±) via the LMCT or MLCT systems upon UV- 
visible irradiation (See Section 2 ). 

6.2. The marketplace for MOF products 

To date, more than 72,0 0 0 MOFs have been synthesized (Cam- 
bridge  Crystallographic  Data  center,  CCDC)  for  various  purposes. 
Closing the knowledge gap between mini-pilot or scale production 
of MOFs and their cost-effectiveness is essential for the commer- 

cialization of MOFs as photocatalysts. The large-scale production of 
MOFs began in mid-2016 with an annual growth that opened the 
door for niche market applications. However, the mass production 
of MOFs is still challenging (Table 5S (a-b): See SM ﬁle) but is nec- 
essary to achieve maturity for industrial applications. To speed up 
commercialization, solvent-free, and water-based MOF production 
strategies should be developed to reduce production cost and es- 
tablish economically viable synthesis procedures [106] . 

The conventional solvothermal process at low temperature was 
reported  to  be  a  successful  procedure  for  the  scale-up  of  MOFs 
in  the  marketplace.  Flow  chemistry  and  extrusion  approaches 
have also been proposed as an alternative approach for the large 
scale  synthesis  of  MOFs  through  a  continuous  ﬂow  system  [43] . 
Flow  chemistry  can  be  carried  out  in  tubes  and  pipes  in  a 
safe  and  effective  mode  with  good  reproducibility.  Extrusion  is 
a  continuous  manufacture  synthesis  process  in  which  a  single 
material  or  mixtures  of  materials  are  compressively  forced  by 
shearing or mixing under high pressure through the barrel (me- 
chanical  process  with  little  or  no  solvent)  [43] .  These  contin- 
uous  synthesis  methods  facilitated  the  enhancement  of  STY  to 
a  large  extent,  commonly  at  a  lower  capital  cost.  This  is  be- 
cause those methods were advantageous in reducing the amount 
of precursors and energy consumption when compared to tradi-

41 

tional solvothermal/hydrothermal batch methods at any given time 
[359] . 

The  effectiveness  of  the  pilot-scale  production  processes  of 
MOFs is determined by a process space-time yield (STY) param- 
eter [43] . STY refers to the weight of yielded MOFs product (kg) 
per unit  volume of the  reaction mixture  (m 3 )  per time (day) of 
synthesis.  The  economically  viable  synthetic  process  is  generally 
represented  by  a  high  STY  value  (maximized  production  rate  in 
minimum time) using low-cost precursors. Table 5S (b) shows the 
STY (kg m −3 d −1 ) and the absolute production rate (g h −1 ) for the 
pilot-scale synthesis of many MOFs using different procedures. Due 
to the diverse synthetic procedures/conditions for the fabrication 
of MOFs, it is desirable to optimize the synthetic process of MOFs 
for later commercial adaptability that would allow scalable MOF 
engineering [105] . Apart from optimization, some issues should be 
resolved before the commercialization of MOFs including (1) the 
cost of precursors and their availability, (2) development of low- 
temperature/pressure and little or no solvent synthesis for safe and 
sustainable operations, (3) large STYs with high purity and produc- 
tion  rate,  (4)  puriﬁcation  and  activation  processes,  and  (5)  good 
crystallinity with high surface area of the yield products. 

7. Conclusions, outlook, and future challenges 

MOFs are structurally ﬂexible materials that readily deform in 
the presence of external stimuli like temperature, pressure, certain 
aqueous conditions (pH level and salinity), and light intensity. The 
recent progress in using MOFs as photocatalysts has demonstrated 
their great potential in various ﬁelds. However, the diﬃculties as- 
sociated with the scale-up of MOF synthesis remain a major bar- 
rier to their technological expansion. For the practical implemen- 
tation of MOFs in environmental/energy photocatalysis, several is- 
sues should be considered, such as decreasing scaling-up costs at 
high space-time yield while eﬃciently maintaining the structural 
controls during the synthesis processes. Note that some MOF fami- 
lies like ZIF, UiO-66, and the MIL series preexist as aqueous phase- 
stable  materials.  However,  the  enthalpies  of  their  porous  frame- 
works  showed  modest  metastabilities  relative  to  the  condensed 
frameworks. This is, in general, due to the strong chemical interac- 
tions between metal sites and environmental molecules (e.g., wa- 
ter, solvents, and reactants/products), followed by ligand displace- 
ment/hydrolysis reactions. Hence, diverse forms of their compos- 
ites can be used as stable photocatalysts for environmental/energy 
applications.  In  many  cases,  the  enhanced  photocatalytic  activi- 
ties in modiﬁed MOF photocatalysts could be attributed to unin- 
tentional defective structures in MOF photocatalysts created dur- 
ing in-situ synthesis or PSM strategies. Such formed defects can 
cause a signiﬁcant switch in the charge mobility/separation pro- 
cess, as systematically validated by various computational studies. 
However, it is critically important to modulate the number of these 
structural defects in MOF crystals to optimize photocatalytic per- 
formance (i.e., avoid unfavorable disorder in the charge mobility 
within the crystal structure). Therefore, future studies should aim 
to implement various computational theories to predict the possi- 
ble defects in MOF structures during synthesis or modiﬁcation and 
their expected impact on the electronic structure of materials to 
optimize their synthetic conditions. 

From the perspective of the photocatalytic capability of those 
MOFs,  a  technical  breakthrough  in  the  application  is  highly  de- 
pendent on improving redox-activities and visible-light responsive- 
2 pro- 
ness towards various applications (e.g., N 
duction, organic photoredox reactions, and pollutants (aqueous and 
gaseous) degradation) as discussed in this review. Such limitations 
can be overcome by a number of technical options such as the sub- 
stitution of visible-light responsive moieties (such as ligand func- 
tionalization and photosensitization) and encapsulation of redox- 

2 reduction, H 

2 /CO 

active guest molecules (such as metal/metal oxides, and combina- 
tion of photo-active metal-centers or metal-free semiconductors). 
To achieve further progress in pre-/post-synthesis strategies, it is 
desirable to consider eﬃcient modulation and engineering for ki- 
netically and hydrothermally stable MOF-based photocatalysts un- 
der real-world conditions using non-labile organic ligands and hard 
Lewis base/high valence metal sites. Also, it is desirable to employ 
the  DFT  calculations,  electron  transfer  mechanisms,  and  frontier 
molecular orbital theory to guide the modiﬁcation of the HOMO- 
LUMO level within this MOF series and to realize the inﬂuence of 
modiﬁcation strategies on the photocatalytic performance. Subse- 
quently, further comprehensive investigations are recommended in 
the future, as many issues have not been adequately examined. 

• Modulated design of MOFs with superior photocatalytic ac- 
tivity can be achieved by appropriate selection of both or- 
ganic  linkers  and  metal  ions  along  with  functional  groups 
for PSM processes. However, more focus should be placed 
on the development of recyclable photoactive and environ- 
mentally benign MOF materials as a viable option for envi- 
ronmental applications. 

• Theoretical  considerations  based  on  DFT,  electronic  struc- 
ture, and frontier molecular orbits can be utilized as tools to 
effectively modulate the design of the HOMO-LUMO levels 
in MOFs and to improve photo-generated charge separation. 
• STY  and  production  rate  are  the  main  essential  parame- 
ters for the scale-up of MOF-based photocatalysts. However, 
the structural deformation of MOF crystals during pilot-scale 
synthesis could also inﬂuence their application performance. 
Thus,  initial  effort s  should  be  directed  for  optimization  of 
their  pilot-scale  production  with  excellent  crystalline  and 
pure MOF yield products to achieve high STY. 

• Future studies should be made to investigate the absolute 
extinction coeﬃcient for the ligand- to-metal charge transi- 
tion in MOFs during photocatalysis. 

• Future  efforts  should  also  be  made  to  develop  advanced 
multifunctional MOF photocatalysts that can simultaneously 
induce both oxidation and reduction reactions. 

• Moving forward, the thermodynamic analysis (such as en- 
thalpy of MOFs formation/phase transition) should also be 
considered to offer better insights into kinetic stability and 
synthesis pathways/mechanisms for all new MOFs. On this 
basis, the MOF structural benchmark for photocatalytic ap- 
plications could be assessed based on their kinetic stability 
and QE rating for speciﬁc environmental/energy applications.
