Thermal runaway incidents involving lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) occur frequently and pose a considerable safety
risk. This comprehensive review explores the characteristics and mechanisms of thermal runaway in LIBs as well
as  evaluation  methods  and  possible  countermeasures.  First,  the  characteristics  of,  factors  influencing,  and
mechanisms underlying thermal runaway in LIBs are examined in detail. Second, thermal runaway propagation
is explored. The characteristics and formation mechanisms of the products of thermal runaway such as flames,
gases,  and  solids  are  also  explored.  The  thermal  hazards  associated  with  toxic  products,  high  temperature,
smoke, pressure shocks, combustion, and explosions must be appropriately prevented. Therefore, multiparameter
evaluation methods for assessing the risk of thermal runaway in LIBs are discussed. Finally, this review details
various  countermeasures  for  controlling or  preventing thermal  runaway  in  LIBs.  Overall, although  inherently
safe  LIBs  can  be  developed,  suitable  warning  systems,  thermal  runaway  suppression  materials,  and  fire-
extinguishing systems are valuable for thermal runaway management.

1. Introduction

Lithium-ion  batteries  (LIBs)  are  common  devices  used  for  storing
electrical power. They are frequently used in modern electronic devices
because they are cost-competitive and have superior reusability to other
types of batteries. The widespread use of LIBs has powered economic
growth  and increased  peopleâs quality  of life.  The annual power  pro-
duction of LIBs in China exceeded 1000 GWh in 2023, with the total
value  of  this  power  being  over  US$170  billion  [1].  Robust  growth  is
projected  to  continue  in  the  manufacturing  of  not  only  LIBs  but  also
derivative  products.  However,  safety  risks  inhibit  the  utility  of  LIBs
[2â4], and researchers have devoted considerable effort to reducing and
mitigating  these  risks.  In  particular,  thermal  runaway  in  LIBs  can  be
dangerous to humans and harmful to the environment. Thus, LIB safety
is  frequently  discussed  in  the  literature  on  electrochemistry  and  risk
management.

Thermal runaway incidents involving LIBs are often attributable to
mechanical, electrical, or thermal factors; runaway can occur because of
intrinsic  safety  defects  in  the  battery  or  inappropriate  battery  usage
[5â7]. LIBs typically comprise modules of tightly packed cells; therefore,
thermal runaway may rapidly propagate through the cells in such bat-
teries. Thermal runaway can result in the release of gases, the ejection of
solids, and the occurrence of high temperature, pressure shocks, com-
bustion,  and  explosion  [8,9].  These  events  can  lead  to  secondary  di-
sasters, potentially resulting in substantial economic losses. Numerous
researchers have comprehensively explored the characteristics of ther-
mal runaway in LIBs, with five characteristic stages being identified in
this  process:  initiation,  growth,  evolution,  propagation,  and  (cata-
strophic) outcomes [10â14]. When heat is produced and accumulates

because of mechanical, electrical, or thermal factors within an LIB, side
reactions  are  promoted,  including  reactions  of  the  anode  or  cathode
material  with  the  electrolyte  and  decomposition  of  the  electrolyte,
cathode  material,  or  solidâelectrolyte  interphase  (SEI)  layer.  If  heat
generation and accumulation are not controlled in a timely and effective
manner, thermal runaway can begin in the LIB. The high temperature,
combustion, pressure shock, toxic substances, and explosion associated
with  the  propagation  of  thermal  runaway  have  catastrophic  effects.
Therefore, researchers have investigated the reaction mechanisms, risks,
and consequences of thermal runaway and have proposed various risk
management strategies and countermeasures on the basis of the results
of relevant research.

Studies  have  investigated  various  aspects  of  thermal  runaway  in
LIBs;  however,  these  studies  are  loosely  connected,  and  a  systematic
summary  of  relevant  results  is  lacking.  Therefore,  the  present  study
comprehensively  reviewed  research  regarding  the  mechanisms  of,
methods for evaluating, and countermeasures for thermal runaway in
LIBs. The goal of this review was to enhance the overall understanding
regarding LIB safety. The remainder of this review is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 discusses the features, influencing factors, and mecha-
nisms  of  thermal  runaway  propagation  in  LIBs.  Section  3 details  the
characteristics  of  thermal  runaway  propagation  and  the  effects  of
various factors on such propagation. Section 4 describes the character-
istics and mechanisms of formation of the products of thermal runaway.
Section  5 elucidates  methodologies  for  evaluating  hazards  associated
with  thermal  runaway  in  LIBs.  Section  6 summarizes  measures  for
mitigating  thermal  runaway  in  LIBs,  including  improvements  to  the
safety of battery components, thermal runaway warning systems, ther-
mal runaway barriers, and thermal runaway suppression or elimination

elements. The electrodes are typically thin and can therefore be stacked
in numerous layers [15]. Mechanical abuse can result in damage to this
fine  structure,  resulting  in  internal  imbalances  in  the  LIB.  In  severe
cases, such damage can lead to hazardous ISC [16]. For example, bat-
teries  in  electric  vehicles  are  exposed  to  complex  operating  environ-
ments  in  which  collisions,  height  drops,  crushing  actions,  vibrations,
and rollovers can occur, all of which can cause mechanical damage to
battery cells [17]. To prevent problems, numerous mechanical testing
standards have been developed for electric vehicles, such as those pro-
posed by the International Organization for Standardization, the Inter-
national  Electrotechnical  Commission,  and
the  Underwriters
Laboratories.

Mechanical abuse causes internal battery damage and SC [18] and
often leads to safety problems in an LIB. It results in mechanical defor-
mation of the LIB and deformation and destruction of the batteryâs in-
ternal laminar structure. This process can lead to direct contact between
the two types of electrodes in the battery, triggering ISC, which results in
the heating of the battery. When the batteryâs temperature surpasses the
batteryâs thermal threshold, a violent and dangerous exothermic reac-
tion occurs [19,20]. Thus, LIB safety problems resulting from mechan-
ical abuse involve three key stages: mechanical deformation, ISC, and
thermal runaway (Fig. 1).

2.1.1. Deformation of lithium-ion batteries subjected to mechanical abuse
The multilayer structure of an LIB has complex mechanical proper-
ties, and LIBs with different structures have differing mechanical prop-
erties  [21].  Fig.  2 depicts  some  common  multilayer  structures  of
commercial LIBs. The mechanical properties of battery cells are similar
to those of the elastomeric materials that they are made from Ref. [22].
Automotive battery packs comprise tightly packed upright cylindri-
cal cells. This design prevents the cells from being crushed in various
directions when a vehicle is struck or strongly hits the ground. Although
prismatic cells (i.e., rectangular cells) have higher capacity and space
efficiency  than  do  cylindrical  cells,  prismatic  cells  have  lower  crush
resistance when grouped [23]. Of all types of automotive battery cell,
pouch cells have the lowest external pack strength and are thus most
susceptible  to  mechanical  abuse.  Moreover,  they  require  additional
immobilization for use in an automotive battery pack. Therefore, pouch
cells are rarely employed as automotive batteries. Fig. 3 illustrates the
types of mechanical test conducted on cylindrical and prismatic batte-
ries. This figure does not distinguish between pouch and prismatic cells
because they have similar shapes and internal structures.

Mechanical  abuse  does  not  always  result  in  ISC,  and  not  all  ISC
events  result  in  thermal  runaway.  Whether  thermal  runaway  occurs
depends on whether the heat produced by ISC increases the batteryâs
temperature to a critical level [45]. Different forms of mechanical abuse
result in differing types of ISC, and the type of ISC determines the risk of
thermal runaway.

techniques. Section 7 presents suggestions for future research. Finally,
Section 8 provides the conclusions of this study.

2. Thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries

LIBs are usually stable during their storage and operation. However,
thermal runaway might occur in LIBs when they are exposed to extreme
conditions, which can be summarized as being mechanical abuse, elec-
trical abuse, and thermal abuse. Thermal runaway develops as follows.
First, an LIB is subject to mechanical abuse in the form of a collision,
extrusion,  or  needling.  Second,  the  resultant  mechanical  deformation
may cause internal short-circuiting (ISC) in the LIB, which is a form of
electrical abuse. In addition to ISC, overcharging, overdischarging, and
external short-circuiting (SC) can occur, all of which are common forms
of electrical abuse that result in the generation of considerable heat and
safety  hazards.  Finally,  heat  accumulation  resulting  from  mechanical
and electrical abuse can result in thermal abuse, which induces thermal
runaway  within  the  LIB.  Exposing  batteries  to  elevated  temperature
increases the batteryâs internal temperature, which may trigger thermal
runaway.

2.1. Thermal runaway induced by mechanical abuse

LIBs  are  composed  of  wound  or  stacked  multilayer  structures
comprising  positive  and  negative  electrodes  divided  by  separating

Pinpricks  are  the  type  of  mechanical  abuse  that  is  most  likely  to
result in ISC, and needling experiments are conducted to test the dura-
bility of cells against pinpricks. In needling tests, a steel needle is driven
through a cell, penetrating multiple layers and acting as a conductor;
this  process  results  in  multi-cell-layer  SC  [46].  This  SC  test  is  highly
destructive  and  is  an  effective  method  for  inducing  thermal  runaway
[19,47];  few  LIBs  can  successfully  pass  this  test.  Current  mechanical
testing standards regarding pinpricks are somewhat controversial, and
data  from  needling  experiments  have  limited  use  in  practical  LIB
development. The mechanical stress tests most frequently conducted on
LIBs are compression and ball-head squeezing tests, which indicate how
an LIB react under overall compression and localized mechanical abuse,
respectively.

Pouch  batteries  have  low  case  strength;  thus,  mechanical  stress  is
readily  transferred  to  their  cells.  Automated  extrusion  tests  are  often
conducted to study the deformation of pouch battery cells. Fig. 4 dis-
plays  the  internal  deformation  and  ISC  induced  in  a  pouch  battery
during  a  ball-head  squeezing  test.  As  the  stress  reaches  the  extrusion
surface, the damage to the batteryâs internal structure increases. Because
of the elasticity of the battery, damage occurs in areas away from the
damaged surface. Most damage occurs near the extrusion surface, and
ISC is thus most likely to occur in this area [20].

mechanical abuse

When  an  LIB  is  subject  to  mechanical  abuse,  it  initially  deforms
readily  because  its  laminate  structure  contains  gaps  for  electrolyte
storage. However, the size of these gaps gradually decreases with the
progress of the mechanical abuse. Eventually, the slope of the batteryâs
forceâdisplacement  curve  increases until  the  batteryâs  laminate  struc-
ture  is  damaged.  The  battery  voltage  fluctuates  immediately  before
damage occurs because of the nonuniformity of the laminate structure.
Specifically, because the layers of the structure are heterogeneous, the
time required for their damage varies, which results in fluctuations in
cell voltage [48]. In previous tests, these voltage fluctuations can indi-
cate two states. First, a sudden drop in battery voltage implies that ISC
has occurred. Second, an increase in battery temperature implies that a
localized  hot  spot  has  formed,  resulting  in  the  accumulation  of  sub-
stantial  current  and  consequent  heat  generation,  which  may  cause
thermal runaway [30,49,50].

Mechanical  abuse  involves  damage  to  the  internal  structure  of  an
LIB, which can lead to ISC and chemical reactions. Therefore, a simple
mean - value model is inadequate for accurately simulating the internal
changes  and  SC  within  an  LIB  subjected  to  mechanical  abuse.  Thus,
researchers have proposed alternative approaches that involve the real-
time integration of various models, such as battery, mechanical, SC, and
thermal  models.  Simulations  conducted  using  these  methods  have

revealed that the part of the battery nearest to an impact is the first area
to exhibit SC and a temperature increase. This part is subjected to the
highest force and thus is most susceptible to mechanical failure (Fig. 5)
[48,51]. Computer simulations have enabled safe investigation of po-
tential internal battery damage and thermal runaway conditions during
and after mechanical abuse. Standardized and repeatable results have
been obtained in such simulations.

2.1.3. Thermal runaway of cells under mechanical abuse

Severe mechanical abuse leads to thermal runaway only when such
abuse leads to rapid production and little dissipation of heat. The heat
production is primarily affected by the state of charge (SOC) and the
electrode material (Fig. 6) [16,20,38]. Thermal runaway is more likely
to occur in devices with a higher SOC [52]. For example, lithium iron
phosphate (LFP) batteries are less prone to thermal runaway than are
LIBs  under  similar  levels  and  types  of  mechanical  abuse,  possibly
because LFP batteries have lower energy density, which inhibits exces-
sive heat development in the ISC region. Moreover, LFP batteries are
more  stable  and  thus  less  prone  to  thermal  runaway  than  are  LIBs.
However, the relative risks of mechanical abuse for different types of
battery remain poorly understood. Direct comparisons of the results of

different  studies  may  be  misleading  because  of  differences  in  the
experimental conditions employed in these studies.

Mechanical abuse does not change the material composition of the
battery or the nature of any thermal runaway reaction; however, studies
have  indicated  that mechanical  abuse  affects  the  intensity  of  thermal
runaway. Specifically,  mechanical abuse can accelerate  the release of
energy in a thermal runaway reaction because the positive and negative
electrodes of the battery become closer when the battery is compressed
(Fig. 7). If compression occurs, thermal runaway must occur in a smaller
space,  which  leads  to  higher-energy  ejection  of  material  [53].  In
particular, pinprick-induced thermal runaway has a high energy release
rate. Finegan et al. [54] measured the internal temperature of batteries
during pinprick tests by embedding a thermocouple in the steel needle
used to make pinpricks. They then used computed tomography (CT) to
image the changes in the batteryâs internal structure. For each battery,
the pinprick promptly caused ISC between the interior battery layers,
and  the  resulting  thermal  runaway  produced  high  temperature  and
gases that caused a shock current within the battery; this current then
damaged the laminate structure. Such damage led to rapid propagation
of  the  thermal  runaway  inside  the  battery,  followed  by  high  surface
temperature  and  violent  jets  of  hot  solids.  These  characteristics  are

typical  of  pinprick-induced  thermal  runaway  events.  A  strong  impact
can  also  cause
thermal  runaway,  producing  a
high-velocity  flame  jet  of  hot  solids  [55â58].  Thus,  the  main  hazard
associated with mechanical abuse is the occurrence of thermal runaway
in the device with cascaded ISC. In this scenario, little time is available
for safe dissipation of heat before thermal runaway occurs [52,55].

2.2. Thermal runaway induced by electrical abuse

2.2.1. Characteristics of thermal runaway induced by electrical abuse

The most common types of electrical abuse are overcharging, over-
discharging, external SC, and ISC. Overcharging is the most critical form
of  electrical  abuse  because  the  excessive  electrical  charge  that  accu-
mulates  during  overcharging  cannot  be  managed  adequately  [60].
Accordingly,  this  thermal  hazard  has  attracted  the  most  research

interest. Numerous studies have investigated the ramifications and dy-
namics of overcharging. Table 1 lists the overcharging characteristics of
various types of LIB. Fig. 8 displays five key stages of a battery over-
charging event [61]. In the first stage, the temperature and voltage in-
crease slowly until the additional capacity of the cathode and anode has
been filled. In the second stage, contact with the lithium plating causes
the temperature and voltage to increase at a higher rate. In the third
stage,  the  peak  voltage  is  reached,  and  the  temperature  increases
considerably  because  of  the  oxidative  decomposition  of  the  batteryâs
electrolyte. In the final stage, the battery ruptures, and thermal runaway
occurs in most cases.

Overdischarging, which involves the excessive discharge of energy
from a battery, is often considered the gentlest form of electrical abuse.
In contrast to overcharging, overdischarging rarely culminates in ther-
mal  runaway,  fire,  or  explosion,  even  for  NCM811  batteries  in  an

adiabatic  environment  [72].  However,  overdischarging  can  harm  the
battery. For example, it can induce the formation of Cu dendrites, which
lead to ISC, ultimately resulting in battery failure [73,74]. During the
first  stage  of  overdischarging,  the  battery  exhibits  a  rapid  voltage
decrease  and  moderate  temperature  increase,  and  all  Li-ions  are
extracted from the anode. In the second stage of overdischarging, the
battery  voltage  begins  to  rise,  and  the  batteryâs  surface  temperature
gradually  reaches  its  peak  value.  Moreover,  Cu  dissolution  occurs,
resulting in Cu2+
being dissolving in the electrolyte, passing through the
separator, and eventually being deposited on the cathode. Subsequently,
Cu dendrites form, which leads to ISC.

Thermal runaway does not occur for most batteries with external SC
because energy is extracted from such batteries. The literature indicates
that  when  external  SC  occurs,  the  voltage  decreases,  and  the  current

swiftly increases [75â78]. As Li-ions are extracted from the anode of an
LIB, the resistance increases because of breakdown of the SEI layers and
deformation of the graphite structure. Therefore, the current decreases,
the  voltage  increases  until  it  plateaus,  and  the  temperature  increases
because  of  the  occurrence  of  Joule  heating.  The  resistance  then  de-
creases as the temperature rises, and the current may increase margin-
ally. The SEI layers decompose as the temperature increases. Without
the protection of these layers, the anode can react with the electrolyte,
which results in an increase in the temperature, thereby possibly melting
the separator. Eventually, the current and voltage decrease to near 0.

ISC  results  in  a  large  current  discharge,  which  may  produce  sub-
stantial heat and thereby trigger thermal runaway. On the basis of the
type  of  connection,  ISC  is  categorized  as  cathodeâanode,  cath-
odeâcopper  current  collector,  aluminum  current  collectorâanode,  or

aluminum current collectorâcopper current collector ISC [79]. Of these
types of ISC, aluminum current collectorâcopper current collector ISC
poses the greatest risk because such ISC is associated with low internal
resistance and poor heat dissipation [34,79]. However, the most com-
mon type of ISC is cathodeâanode ISC, which occurs after damage to the
separator; such damage can be caused by numerous factors, including
lithium dendrite formation, Cu dendrite formation, high temperature,
mechanical  abuse,  and  structural  deformation  (referred  to  as  a  âjelly
rollâ).

2.2.2. Effect of charging rate on thermal runaway characteristics during
electrical abuse

Ohmâs  law  indicates  that  current  generates  heat.  For  LCO  and
lithium  manganese  oxide  (LMO)  batteries,  the  heat  generated  during
overcharging increases approximately linearly with the charging current
when  this current is in the range 0.1â1.0 C [80]. The heat generated
during overcharging comprises Joule heat, reversible heat, and the heat
produced through side reactions. The heat generated by side reactions
contributes more than 80 % of the energy in thermal runaway events
when the charging current is less than 1 C. However, this percentage
decreases as the charging current is increased up to 1 C. Moreover, under
a higher charging rate, the time to thermal runaway is shorter because
electrical energy is stored in the battery more quickly [65,68]. During
thermal  runaway, the  batteryâs  SOC decreases  as  the charging  rate is
increased. Accordingly, the maximum temperature attained by a battery
during thermal runaway increases with the charging current [68], and

the  exothermic  onset  of  thermal  runaway  depends  on  the  available
charging current. In one study, NCM111 batteries that were overcharged
with a current of less than 0.1 C did not experience rupture or thermal
runaway [81]. Similarly, for charging currents of less than 0.3 C, ther-
mal runaway did not occur for NCM622 batteries [71]. Charging current
is the most crucial factor affecting battery behavior during overcharging
abuse, with its effect exceeding those of ambient temperature and the
batteryâsâ state of health (SOH) [70].

2.2.3. Environmental effects on thermal runaway during electrical abuse

Thermal runaway events are also affected by the local environment.
The  characteristics  of  overcharging-induced  thermal  runaway  differ
markedly  between  adiabatic  and  diabatic  environments.  The  over-
charging  process  has  six  stages  under  adiabatic  conditions  but  four
stages  under  diabatic  conditions  [65].  At  ambient  temperature  in  a
diabatic  environment,  the  peak  temperature  of  an  LIB  occurs  in  the
voltage range 4.4â4.5 V, which corresponds to the heat release process.
Moreover, the batteryâs temperature decreases when the voltage is in the
range 4.5â4.6 V and then increases again when the voltage exceeds 4.6
V. By contrast, under adiabatic conditions, the battery temperature in-
creases continuously until the voltage reaches 5.1 V. Consequently, the
overcharging  process  can  be  divided  into  more  stages  under  diabatic
conditions  than  under  adiabatic  conditions.  Thermal  runaway  occurs
under adiabatic conditions but not under ambient diabatic conditions
when  the  charging  current  is  0.5  C.  The  heat  generated  during  over-
charging  is  dissipated  at  ambient  temperature,  and  this  dissipation

inhibits  thermal  runaway.  The  maximum  battery  temperature  during
overcharging is higher when the ambient temperature is higher [82].

The battery heating rate at 30
C because the
batteryâs resistance is lower at higher ambient temperature. However,
higher ambient temperature results in faster reactions between plated
lithium  and  the  electrolyte  and  thus  incurs  a  higher  risk  of  thermal
runaway [70].

â¦
C is higher than that at 60

Ambient  temperature  affects  the  internal  resistance  and  thus  the
external SC characteristics of LIBs. In one study, the duration of the high-
current period was greater when the ambient temperature was lower;
thus,  the  maximum  temperature  was  higher  when  the  ambient  tem-
perature was lower. Moreover, at higher ambient temperature, devices
were more prone to leakage during external SC [83].

2.2.4. Effect of state of health on thermal runaway during electrical abuse
The macroscopic and microscopic properties of LIBs vary over their
lifetime, with their capacity and internal resistance tending to decrease
and gradually increase over time, respectively. Both anode and cathode
materials  degrade  during  battery  cycling  [84],  and  SEI  layers  and
lithium  plating  may  form  on  the  anode  surface.  The  intercalation  of
electrolyte  causes  graphite  exfoliation,  and  a  cathodeâelectrolyte
interphase forms on the cathode surface. Moreover, transition metal ions
may  dissolve  from  the  cathode,  leading  to  structural  damage.
Throughout charging and discharging, the entry and extraction of Li ions
at the anode and cathode can induce particle cracks within the active
materials, with these cracks being attributable to stresses and volume
changes. SOH is a parameter that describes the similarity between the
current and ideal macroscopic and microscopic properties of a battery

during cycling. A decrease in the SOH of an LIB is a form of electrical
abuse. Separator melting and micro-ISC occur when batteries with an

C [61]. SOH moderately affects
SOH of less than 70 % are cycled at 40
the amount of heat produced by side reactions during thermal runaway
induced by lithium plating that occurs when the battery is cycled at low
temperature and charged rapidly. This phenomenon results in a decrease
in  a  batteryâs  safety  as  its  cells  age  [85].  The  thermal  risk  to  an  LIB
during  overcharging  decreases  as  the  SOH  decreases  because  the  SEI
layer exhibits considerable growth after the battery has been cycled at
high  temperature  [61].  For  aged  batteries  overcharged  at  40
C,  SEI
layer  growth  somewhat  mitigates  the  increase  in  thermal  risk;  the
thermal  risk  is  higher  when  an  aged  battery  is  overcharged  at  10
C
because of the presence of plated lithium. In Ref. [86], thermal runaway
was found to occur later in batteries cycled at 55
C than in fresh bat-
teries. In summary, the effect of SOH on the thermal runaway of an LIB
during electrical abuse mainly depends on the age of the battery, which
determines whether a battery has SEI layer growth or lithium plating.

2.2.5. Effect of cathode material on thermal runaway during electrical
abuse

The cathode material is a key component of an LIB, determines its
characteristics, and affects its thermal runaway behaviors during elec-
trical abuse. The differences in the thermal runaway characteristics of
batteries  with  different  cathode  materials  can  understood  by  investi-
gating  these  batteriesâ  characteristic  thermal  runaway  parameters.  In
one  study  from  Ref.  [69],  LFP  batteries  subjected  to  electrical  abuse
underwent thermal runaway earlier than did NCM batteries subjected to
such  abuse;  that  is,  the  LFP  batteries  had  a  shorter  time  to  thermal

10

runaway (tTR). However, during thermal runaway, the maximum tem-
perature of the LFP batteries, denoted Tmax, was less than half that of the
NCM batteries. Moreover, Tmax was positively related to the proportion
of  nickel  within  the  NCM  batteries.  Finally,  the  LFP  batteries  had  a
higher maximum rate of temperature increase during thermal runaway
(Rmax) than did the NCM  batteries. The effect of  cathode material on
thermal  runaway  caused  by  overcharging  was  investigated  for  LCO,
NCM622, and LFP batteries in Ref. [87]. In the aforementioned study,
the  LFP  battery  had  the  lowest  tTR  value,  followed  by  the  LCO  and
NCM622 batteries. During overcharging, the LFP battery did not ignite,
with only a large amount of smoke being generated. By contrast, the LCO
and  NCM622  batteries  exhibited  severe  combustion.  Under  over-
charging at 2 C, the LCO battery exhibited the largest flame in terms of
height, and the NCM622 battery exhibited the largest flame in terms of
area (~0.3 m2).

2.2.6. Thermal runaway mechanisms caused by electrical abuse, and
critical condition analysis

Studies  have  indicated  that  the  heat  produced  during  the  initial
stages  of  overcharging  is  mainly  Joule  and  reversible  heat.  Subse-
quently, heat is primarily generated through side reactions that occur
because of high voltage and temperature. Micro-SC can trigger thermal
runaway  during  overcharging.  Electrical  energy  is  extracted  from  a
battery during overdischarging; thus, overdischarging does not pose a
considerable thermal runaway threat. However, as a downstream effect,
it may produce Cu dendrites that lead to ISC and the associated negative
effects. Energy is extracted from batteries during external SC [73,74];
thus, thermal runaway does not occur in most batteries with external SC

[75â78]. When the battery temperature reaches the melting point of the
separator, ISC occurs, which can cause other problems, such as thermal
runaway. After ISC is triggered, substantial heat is produced, which may
cause thermal runaway in scenarios excluding those in which Cu den-
drites cause ISC during overdischarging.

2.3. Thermal runaway induced by thermal abuse

2.3.1. Characteristics of thermal runaway induced by thermal abuse

Thermal  abuse  testing  is  the  laboratory  method  most  commonly
employed for evaluating thermal runaway reactions in LIBs. These tests
have various advantages, such as a simple setup, positional flexibility,
and a well-established procedural framework. Consequently, regulatory
authorities  worldwide  have  recognized  thermal  abuse  testing  as  a
standard battery testing procedure. Temperature has crucial effects on
the internal reactions that occur during thermal runaway, and various
abuse  conditions  can  lead  to  battery  self-heating.  Researchers  have
thoroughly investigated the effects of temperature variation on internal
battery  reactions during thermal  runaway. When the  temperature ex-
ceeds 90
C, the SEI layer begins to decompose, generating flammable
gases because of the loss of protective layers at the anode [88,89].

â¦

â¦

When a batteryâs temperature exceeds 130

C, the separator begins
to  melt,  which  triggers  battery  shutdown  [60].  Temperatures  above
160
C can also trigger gradual cathode decomposition (depending on
the  cathode material), which results in oxygen release [88,90,91]. At
â¦
C, the electrolyte decomposes, resulting
temperatures higher than 200
in  the  initiation  of  side  reactions,  including  chain  reactions,  which
eventually lead to thermal runaway [91]. Three main factors contribute
to thermal runaway: (i) the release of oxygen from the cathode, (ii) the
deposition  of  lithium  at  the  anode,  and  (iii)  ISC  caused  by  separator
collapse [92].

â¦

Elevated temperature accelerates the generation of gases inside the
battery, which can trigger the opening of safety valves. The situation
becomes increasingly severe if an insufficient amount of heat is dissi-
pated through venting for controlling the temperature. Experiments and
simulations have been conducted to characterize thermal abuse in bat-
teries. One study developed a thermal energy conservation equation to
describe  thermal  runaway  behavior.  Cell  properties  were  comprehen-
sively  evaluated  using  weighted  averages,  and  all  properties  of  the
examined  cells  except  for  their  thermal  conductivity  (which  is  inher-
ently anisotropic) were assumed to be isotropic because of the layered
structure of the cell components [93]. In general, the existing thermal
abuse models account for the heat produced through SEI layer decom-
position  (Qsei),  anode  lithiumâsolvent  reactions  (Qan),  cathode  active
materialâsolvent  reactions  (Qca),  and  electrolyte  decomposition  and
combustion reactions (Qe) [94]:

Qgen = Qsei + Qan + Qca + Qe

(1)

Qgen: total heat release.
Qsei: heat release of SEI decomposition.
Qan: heat release of anode reaction.
Qca: heat release of cathode reaction.
Qe: heat release of electrolyte decomposition.
In ref. [95], chemical reactions occurring at elevated temperature in
batteries  were  investigated  using  a  three-dimensional  thermal  abuse
model  that  accounts  for  a  nonuniform  heat  distribution,  thermal  and
electrical  pathway designs  within  cells,  localized heating  and  cooling
phenomena,  and  cell  component  geometry  and  materials.  In  another
study, the finite-element method was used to develop a comprehensive
three-dimensional  thermal  abuse  model  for  high-capacity  LIBs  [96].
This  model  effectively  predicted  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  be-
haviors of cells in oven tests. Moreover, a statistical simulation model
was developed in one study by integrating conjugate heat transfer with
computational  fluid  dynamics  (CFD)  [97].  This  model  was  found  to
accurately capture the evolution of cell temperature and internal pres-
sure  in  18650-cell  LIBs  under  thermal  abuse  conditions  to  effectively

11

predict venting events and battery combustion. This model could also
predict  thermal  abuse  reactions,  vented  gas  flows,  jet  dynamics,  and
battery combustion characteristics.

In ref. [98], an advanced model for predicting thermal runaway was
developed to overcome the numerical stiffness problems associated with
equations for heat conduction and decomposition reactions. Numerical
stiffness had previously limited the utility of thermal abuse models when
low-dimensional  formulations  had  to  be  used.  The  aforementioned
advanced  model  reduces  numerical  stiffness  by  simplifying  the
three-dimensional transient heat conduction equation into an adiabatic
zero-dimensional  lumped  body  formulation  only  for  the  numerically
stiff portions of the simulation.

Exterior  and  interior  heating  failures  result  in  excessive  interior
heating, which can cause thermally induced battery failure. To inhibit
thermal  runaway,  internal  safety  mechanisms,  such  as  fuses  with  a
positive temperature coefficient and current interruption devices, have
been  added  to  batteries.  Internal  failures  are  a  common  trigger  for
thermal runaway in LIBs. Yan et al. modified commercially 18650-cell
LIBs  by  inserting  a  miniheater  cartridge  that  could  trigger  ISC.  The
modification was reliable and repeatable and did not negatively affect
cell performance [99]. Compared with external heating, internal heating
is  associated  with  a  shorter  venting  period  before  the  initiation  of
thermal runaway. Thus, the effect of internal heating on a cellâs internal
failure path is different from than that of external heating. Accordingly,
modified batteries can be deployed in a clustered and modular manner
to simulate battery failure modes under controllable conditions.

2.3.2. Effect of state of charge on thermal runaway during thermal abuse

Numerous  factors  affect  the  likelihood  of  thermal  runaway,
including  the  battery  systemâs  design,  materials,  and  SOC  [100].
Whether heat is propagated or mitigated depends on the competition
between the chemical heat release rate (HRR) associated with thermal
runaway and the heat dissipation rate. Larger cells tend to release more
energy,  and  the  energy  density  of  cells  varies  depending  on  their
chemistry.  Moreover,  SOC  considerably  affects  the  HRR.  As  the  SOC
increases, more energy becomes available for release during a thermal
runaway event, which  results in a higher  HRR [101â103]. Mitigating
thermal runaway propagation requires a reduction in the available en-
ergy or an increase in heat dissipation. The heating rate of cells can be
effectively  reduced  by  enhancing  their  heat  transfer  rate  or  heat
capacity.

Researchers  have  investigated  the  thermal  runaway  of  LIBs  with
various SOC values. In single-cell batteries, thermal runaway occurs for
a  shorter  time  and  results  in  greater  energy  release  when  the  SOC  is
higher. Moreover, reducing the heating rate amplifies cell preheating,
which accelerates thermal propagation throughout the cell [104]. One
study examined thermal propagation times for cylindrical cell arrange-
ments under SOC levels ranging from 50 % to 100 % [105]. The afore-
mentioned  study  found  that  the  thermal  propagation  time  was
approximately 8.5 times longer and less energy was released when the
SOC level was 50 % than when the SOC level was 100 %. Another study
investigated  the  effects  of  cell  spacing  and  SOC  on  the  occurrence  of
thermal runaway in vertically stacked cylindrical cells [106]. Thermal
runaway was mitigated when the SOC was approximately 50 %.

2.3.3. Effect of state of health on thermal runaway during thermal abuse
The number  of  lithium ions present in  an  LIB determines  the  bat-
teryâs SOC and SOH. SOC is affected by the number of lithium ions and
the electrode material but unaffected by cell structure and other prop-
erties. A higher SOC indicates that the battery has higher potential for
storing electrochemical energy and thus a higher potential difference,
which indicates that more energy is available for release in the event of
battery failure. In contrast to SOC, SOH is primarily affected by cycle
age. Permanent decreases in cell capacity can be directly linked to the
irreversible loss of Li-ions through Li deposition on the anode side or the
formation  of  passivation  surface  layers  on  the  electrodes  [107].

the  battery  module)  influences  whether  the  heating  is  uniform  or
localized,  with  both  types  of  heating  leading  to  thermal  runaway.
External heating delays the first thermal runaway event but intensifies
thermal runaway propagation, resulting in less conductive heat energy
being required to sustain the thermal runaway propagation within the
module.

The effects of heating method on thermal runaway were investigated
in  one  study  from  Ref.  [112]  by  using  a  cylindrical  heating  rod  and
spring  heating  ring.  The  spring  heating  ring  had  higher  heating  effi-
ciency than did the heating rod, resulting in higher surface temperature
and  lower  thermal  runaway  initiation  temperature  when  the  spring
heating ring was used. In addition, the heat required for the occurrence
of a  thermal runaway reaction was  calculated. In another study  from
Ref. [113], a method was developed for determining the optimal heating
power in thermal abuse tests, and thermal runaway could be triggered
under various heating conditions. Low heating power resulted in long
test duration but introduced instability caused by environmental factors.
Conversely, high heating power resulted in ruptures and leakages before
thermal runaway could occur.

3. Thermal runaway propagation for lithium-ion batteries

3.1. Characteristics of thermal runaway propagation in lithium-ion
batteries

LIBs  are  usually  assembled  as  modules  or  packs  to  achieve  high
voltage or capacity. However, modules and packs are at risk of thermal
failure when thermal runaway occurs in a single cell. The cells within
modules or packs are generally tightly arranged to improve the energy
density, and this design increases the risk of thermal runaway propa-
gation. If one or more cells inside a module or pack undergo thermal
failure, the generated heat is propagated to neighboring cells through
thermal conduction, convection, and radiation [97,114,115]. Such heat
propagation can have catastrophic consequences. Fig. 9 illustrates how
heat can propagate layer by layer throughout a battery when thermal
runway  occurs  in  one  of  the  batteryâs  cells  [116â119].  As  heat  accu-
mulates, the propagation of thermal runaway accelerates [120], which
leads to greater combustion and a higher HRR and mass loss rate and
higher impact pressure and combustion efficiency, eventually resulting
in battery ignition. The effects of SOC, SOH, cell gap, battery connection
mode,  structural  arrangement,  failure  location,  and  external  environ-
ment  on  the  characteristics  of  thermal  runaway  propagation  are  dis-
cussed in the following section.

3.2. Effect of state of charge on thermal runaway propagation

SOC  considerably  affects  thermal  runaway  propagation  [105,106,

Fig. 9. Thermal runaway propagation within a battery module.

Continuous formation of the SEI layer during cycling results in depletion
of  Li-ions  and  electrolyte  components.  Furthermore,  a  relatively
low-intensity reaction occurs in which a cathodeâelectrolyte interphase
layer is formed. The effects of SOH and SOC on the safety and behavior
of LIBs were examined previously [108]. A lower SOC and higher SOH
were found to be associated with lower thermal runaway severity and
resistance  to  the  effects  of  cell  surface  temperatures of  up  to 100
C;
moreover, the flammable gas concentration and mass loss of the cells
were  lower.  The  amount  of  carbonate  compounds  in  the  gas  phase
decreased  with  an  increase  in  energy.  By  contrast,  the  amount  of
decomposition products increased with an increase in energy.

2.3.4. Effect of heating conditions on thermal runaway during thermal
abuse

Local overheating is a common phenomenon in battery packs sub-
jected  to  typical  thermal  abuse  conditions.  Numerous  studies  have
examined the thermal abuse conditions that trigger thermal runaway,
which is affected by factors, such as heating power, heating tempera-
ture,  contact method, and  heat source position.  The findings  of  these
studies are detailed in the following text.

In  one  study,  a  cylindrical  heater  was  used  to  trigger  thermal
runaway in batteries to effectively simulate the heat transfer that occurs
in them when they are heated from the side, which is common in real-
world conditions [109]. The simulation results indicated that the bat-
teries became unstable at SOC values of >50 %. At low heating power,
heat conduction was the predominant mode of heat transfer; however,
heat  radiation  became  the  primary  mode  of  heat  conduction  at  high
heating  power.  The  effects  of  the  heat  source  position  have  been
explored [92,110,111]. The position of the heat source (inside or outside

115,116,121â123]. A battery with a higher SOC has a greater potential
difference, which can promote thermal runaway. An experimental study
explored  the  gaseous  emissions,  dynamics,  and  energy  release  during
thermal failure of battery modules [105]. The speed of thermal runaway
propagation was 8.5 times lower under an SOC value of 50 % than under
an SOC value of 100 %. Another study also reported that the speed of
thermal  runaway  propagation  increased  linearly  with  the  SOC  value
[Fig. 10(a)] [115]. Furthermore, the average peak temperature of bat-
teries during thermal runaway was higher when the SOC was higher,
suggesting greater heat release during propagation. Thus, higher SOC
can result in more rapid thermal runaway propagation and a higher risk
of thermal runaway.

In  addition  to  horizontal  propagation,  vertical  propagation  may
occur inside layered battery modules. SOC also plays a crucial role in the
vertical propagation of thermal runaway. In one study from Ref. [106],
vertical thermal propagation was analyzed for two cylindrical batteries
with  both  positive  terminals  facing  upward.  In  the  aforementioned
study, the risk  of thermal runaway propagation was  higher when the
SOC was higher but only for SOC values greater than 50 % [Fig. 10(b)].
Heat transfer analysis indicated that flame heat radiation contributed
more to vertical thermal runaway propagation than did conduction or
convection.

In conclusion, a higher SOC results in a higher risk of severe thermal
runaway. To mitigate the risk of thermal runaway during the storage
and transportation of a battery, the battery should have an SOC of less
than 30 % [124].

3.3. Effect of the environment on thermal runaway propagation

The  heat  propagation  characteristics  of  LIBs  differ  from  those  of
conventional  combustibles.  Environmental  factorsâsuch  as  ambient
temperature, pressure, and air compositionâaffect the fire dynamics of
a battery after the commencement of thermal runaway. These factors
may also alter thermal runaway by influencing side reactions, gas gen-
eration and transport, heat transfer and dissipation, and gas combustion
properties.  Because  of  the  vast  number  of  possible  scenarios  that  can
result in LIB failure, LIBs are currently designed to withstand environ-
mental pressures ranging from dozens to hundreds of kilopascals. The
effect of environmental pressure on the propagation of thermal runaway
in  batteries  has  received  considerable  attention  from  numerous  re-
searchers  [125â129].  Studies  have  experimentally  investigated  the
aforementioned effect for battery modules comprising 18650 cells ar-
ranged in linear arrays [125,126]. Moreover, they have examined the
heat generation and dissipation characteristics of these modules [Fig. 11
(a)]. Although decreasing the environmental pressure reduces air cool-
ing,  it  also  restrains  the  exothermic  reactions  inside  batteries.  In  one
study from Ref. [125], when the ambient pressure was decreased from
100 to 60 kPa, the decrease in air cooling was greater than that in the
intensity  of  exothermic  reactions.  Consequently,  the  rate  of  thermal
runaway  propagation  increased  slightly  as  the  pressure  was  reduced.
However,  as  the  pressure  was  decreased  further,  the  decrease  in  the
intensity of exothermic reactions obscured all other effects, reducing the
rate of thermal runaway propagation.

Battery chemistry may influence the effect of environmental pressure
on thermal runaway propagation. The variation in the rate of thermal

cell spacing of 4 mm [106]. All figures are reprinted with permission from Elsevier.

runaway propagation with the environmental pressure is smaller for LFP
battery modules than for NCM battery modules [127]. This may be the
reason for the favorable safety of LFP batteries. Moreover, the maximum
temperature and mass loss during thermal runaway are lower for LFP
batteries  than  for  NCM  batteries.  Low  environmental  pressure  may
restrain the heat release and chemical ejections that occur during ther-
mal runaway.

The  effect  of  environmental  temperature  on  the  rate  of  thermal
runaway propagation was investigated in prior research [130]. The re-
sults of this investigation [Fig. 11(b)] indicated that the aforementioned
rate  increased  with  the  temperature  because  higher  temperature
inhibited  heat  dissipation  and  reduced  the  energy  threshold  for  the
occurrence of thermal runaway. Moreover, environmental temperature
had a stronger effect on thermal runaway propagation than did SOC.

Numerous  scholars  have  examined  the  effect  of  atmospheric
composition on thermal runaway propagation in battery modules [119,
131â135].  A  comparative  study  was  conducted  on  thermal  runaway
propagation under various oxygen concentrations by introducing inert
gases, such as nitrogen and argon [119]. As the environmental oxygen
concentration was decreased from 21 % to 12 %, the time interval for
runaway propagation between battery layers increased from 136 to 196
s (a 44 % decrease in the propagation rate), as depicted in Fig. 11(c).
Furthermore, the mass loss and flame temperature decreased when the
oxygen concentration was decreased. The type of diluting gas (nitrogen
or  argon)  did  not  considerably  affect  the  results;  the  authors  of  the
aforementioned  study  thus  recommended  using  nitrogen  to  alleviate
thermal  runaway hazards.  Research  suggests that a pure  inert gas  at-
mosphere  can  efficiently  inhibit  thermal  runaway  in  battery  modules
because  this  atmosphere  lacks  the  oxygen  required  to  sustain  the

serpentine tab connections (reproduced from Ref. [141] with permission from
the Electrochemical Society).

combustion  was  due  to  the  parallel  connection  intensifying  the
exothermic  reactions  within  the  cells.  Moreover,  the  energy  released
from a failed battery triggered thermal runaway in adjacent connected
batteries,  potentially  accounting  for  52%â67  %  of  the  primary  heat
generated in the thermal runaway event. The heat flux to adjacent cells
was  substantially  higher  for  parallel-connected  modules  than  for  un-
connected  modules,  and  this  higher  heat  flux  resulted  in  more  rapid
runaway  propagation  and  higher  thermal  runaway  hazards.  Another
study compared the thermal runaway propagation behaviors of various
modules  with  series  or  parallel  internal  connections  [140].  Thermal
runaway propagation was faster in parallel-connected modules than in
series-connected  or  unconnected  modules.  Furthermore,  the  average
maximum temperature of the parallel-connected modules was approxi-
mately 30

C higher than that of the series-connected modules.
A parallel connection provides a thermal path and conductive path
during thermal runaway [Fig. 13(a)], thereby enabling the transfer of
heat and electrical energy, which exacerbates thermal runaway propa-
gation. A branched tab configuration [Fig. 13(b)] improves the voltage
retention and safety of a battery pack [141]. Similarly, a serpentine tab
configuration enables the effective electrical isolation of a shorted bat-
tery, where a fire can begin, from the rest of the battery pack.

[131â134].

3.4. Effect of cell gap on thermal runaway propagation

To  increase  safety,  some  battery  designs  include  thermal  manage-
ment systems, whereas others rely on adequate cell spacing. Cell spacing
can range from zero to several millimeters, and increasing cell spacing
may  inhibit  thermal  runaway  propagation  [106,115,136â138].  The
thermal runaway propagation behavior of battery modules with an SOC
of 75 % and a cell spacing of 0, 1, 3, or 5 mm was compared in one study
[115].  Thermal  runaway  propagation  was  slower  in  battery  modules
with larger cell spacing and did not occur in the battery module with a
cell spacing of 5 mm. Specifically, the speed of thermal runaway prop-
agation decreased linearly with the square of the cell spacing [Fig. 12
(a)]. This behavior was attributable to the inverse-square relation be-
tween radiation and distance. In another study, cell gap had a similar
effect on vertical thermal runaway propagation [106], particularly for
modules with a lower SOC [Fig. 12(b)â12(d)]. Specifically, for LIBs with
an SOC value of 100 %, 80 %, and 50 %, the critical cell spacing was 8, 6,
and 4 mm, respectively. Thus, increasing the cell spacing within a bat-
tery module can effectively reduce the risk of thermal runaway propa-
gation,  and  designing  batteries  with  adequate  cell  spacing  is  highly
advisable. The cell gap should be selected such that an optimal balance
is achieved between safety and energy density.

3.5. Effect of connection mode on thermal runaway propagation

LIBs are usually connected before their deployment to increase their
voltage or capacity. LIB cells can be connected in several ways, and the
connection  method  affects  the  characteristics  of  thermal  runaway
propagation [130,139â143]. In one study, batteries connected in par-
allel exhibited more intense combustion and thermal runaway propa-
gation  than  did  those  without  any  connection  [139].  This  intensified

15

In summary, the cell connection mode affects how thermal runaway
propagates  across  a  battery  module.  Connections  can  increase  heat
transfer among the cells, thus enabling the rapid spread of overcharging
or overdischarging events during thermal runaway. A combined multi-
cell  discharge  event  results  in  the  release  of  considerable  electrical
charge,  which  results  in  the  generation  of  Joule  heat  that  aggravates
thermal  runaway  propagation.  Manufacturers  should  evaluate  the
connection mode when assembling battery modules to manage thermal
runaway propagation appropriately.

3.6. Effect of battery arrangement on thermal runaway propagation

The  arrangement  of  cells  and  battery  modules  affects  the  thermal
hazard and thermal runaway propagation behavior of an LIB [136,141,
144,145].  The  thermal  runaway  propagation  behaviors  of  battery
modules with different configurations [Fig. 14(a)] were investigated in
one study [144]. Linear, triangular, square, rectangular, rhomboid, and
hexagonal modules were examined, and thermal runaway propagation
and the domino effect were observed for all module layouts. Thermal
runaway propagation was fastest for the rhomboid module and slowest
for  the  triangular  and  linear  modules.  Therefore,  the  authors  of  that
study recommended arranging battery modules in a triangular forma-
tion. In another study [145], compared with a 4 Ã 1 module, a 2 Ã 2
module  had  higher  explosion  pressure,  mass  loss,  and  oxygen  con-
sumption  and  generated  higher  levels  of  CO  and  CO2  during  thermal
runaway.  These  results  were  attributable  to  the  greater  contact  area
among the cells in the 2 Ã 2 module. Moreover, in Ref. [141], battery
modules with cylindrical cells were less susceptible to thermal runaway
propagation  than  were  those  with  pouch  cells  because  of  the  limited
contact between neighboring cylindrical cells [Fig. 14(b)].

Different battery module arrangements lead to different heat transfer
paths and contact areas, which result in varying thermal runaway effect.
Battery arrangement should be selected on the basis of many factors,
including user preference, energy density requirements, and the risk of
thermal runaway propagation.

3.7. Effect of failure location on thermal runaway propagation

Battery modules contain multiple cells, and the failure of any indi-
vidual cell can initiate a thermal runaway event. The positions, spacing,
and orientations of battery modules affect the propagation of thermal
runaway through them. Therefore, different levels of battery failure (i.
e.,  cell,  module,  or  pack  failure)  lead  to  different  thermal  runaway
outcomes [111,116,146â150].

Fig. 15(a) illustrates different positions at which thermal runaway

propagation can begin in a battery module (i.e., at the corner, edge, and
center) [116]. Thermal runaway is most severe when cell failure occurs
near  the  center  of  a  battery  module  because  surrounding  cells  are
affected  most  quickly  in  this  scenario,  leading  to  the  strongest  heat
failure effect. This result suggests that the thermal insulation of central
cells should be prioritized in battery modules. Although this approach
may  not  entirely  stop  thermal  runaway,  it  can  postpone  thermal
runaway and is cost-effective. Fig. 15(b) illustrates the propagation of
thermal runaway inside a single cell when thermal runaway begins at
the positive terminal, negative terminal, or middle part of the cell [146].
Thermal runaway near the positive terminal results in the most rapid
and  violent thermal failure, with flames  and the  highest surface  tem-
peratures  being  produced.  A  study  of  battery  modules  with  multiple
layers  indicated  that  the  initial  thermal  runaway  is  slow  within  the
module containing the failed cell [149]. However, the thermal runaway
then extends to adjacent modules, and the speed of thermal runaway
propagation increases. If thermal runaway propagates across all battery
modules, the propagation speed increases, and a considerable amount of
energy is released quickly. Moreover, thermal runaway propagation is
faster and more severe if the initial thermal runaway is more intense.

Numerous studies have indicated that the locations of thermal failure
in  a  battery  module  affect  the  severity  of  thermal  failure,  the  total
generated heat, and the heat transfer paths. The location most prone to
triggering  a  severe  thermal  runaway  propagation  event  should  be
prioritized in mitigation strategies, which can involve the use of insu-
lation or monitoring equipment.

3.8. Effects of battery components on thermal runaway propagation

The  key  components  of  LIBs,  such  as  their  electrode  materials,

separator, and electrolyte, influence their electrochemical performance.
Moreover, these components substantially affect the safety characteris-
tics of LIBs; batteries comprising components with higher thermal sta-
bility  are  less  prone  to  thermal  runaway  and  thermal  runaway
propagation [127,151â154]. A triple-salt ethylene carbonate (EC)âfree
electrolyteânamely  a  mixture  of  0.8  M  lithium  bis(fluorosulfonyl)
imide, 0.1 M lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide, and 0.6 M LiPF6
in ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)âwas proposed for the development of
high-safety and high-energy NCM811 pouch batteries [151]. Compared
with a commercial electrolyte, the aforementioned EC-free electrolyte
led to higher intrinsic safety of the NCM811 pouch batteries; the thermal
runaway  temperature  of  the  batteries  was  67.0
C  higher,  and  the
thermal runaway propagation time was 9.88 s longer. In Ref. [153], the
effects of LFP and NCM111 cathodes on thermal runaway propagation in
large  battery  modules  was  investigated.  Compared  with  the  module
containing  NCM111  cathodes,  that  containing  LFP  cathodes  was  less
likely  to  experience  thermal  runaway  propagation  under  the  same
conditions.  Although  thermal  runaway  propagation  occurred  in  the
LFP-cathode-containing  module,  it  was  less  aggressive and  risky  than
that in the NCM111-cathode-containing module.

3.9. Mechanism of thermal runaway propagation and analysis of critical
conditions

Heat  transfer  is  the  fundamental  mechanism  affecting  thermal
runaway propagation within a single cell and between cells [114,147,
155,156]. The heat emitted in the thermal runaway region spreads to
neighboring areas through conduction, convection, and radiation. After
the temperature reaches a critical threshold, side reactions occur, such
as  SEI  layer  breakdown,  ISC,  and  electrolyte  decomposition.  Finally,

runaway, Qcond is the heat transferred from the thermal runaway zone to the preheating zone, Qrea is the heat generation rate of the electrochemical reaction, Qgas is
the heat carried away by the gas ejected in the thermal runaway zone, VTR  is the average thermal runaway propagation velocity inside the battery, TP is the cellâs
peak temperature, TTR is the cellâs thermal runaway temperature, and T0 is the ambient temperature. In (b), T2(cond) is the upper cellâs temperature when only heat
conduction is considered. Part (a) depicts the thermal runaway propagation mechanism within a cell (from the thermal runaway zone to the preheating zone), and

tween them.

thermal runaway commences in a region and propagates across nearby
cells.  In  Ref.  [147],  the  temperature  difference  between  the  thermal
runaway zone and the surrounding area was investigated. The investi-
gation revealed that thermal runaway propagation within a single cell is
a heat and mass transfer process in which thermal conductivity plays a
crucial role in determining the propagation rate [Fig. 16(a)]. Thermal
runaway propagation is more severe under higher thermal conductivity,
a higher temperature gradient, and lower critical temperature.

In  ref.  [155],  thermal  runaway  propagation  between  cells  was
explored by evaluating the heat transfer mechanisms for a cell shell and
terminal  connector  as  well  as  combustion  effects.  Heat  conduction
through the cell shell dominated the heat transfer process, whereas fire
radiation had little effect on this process. This result differed from prior
results obtained by the same group of authors regarding horizontal and
vertical  thermal  runaway  propagation  [106].  Their  other  study  indi-
cated that fire radiation was the greatest contributor to vertical thermal
runaway propagation [Fig. 16(b)]. If heat conduction is the primary heat
transfer mode for thermal runaway propagation, the temperature of the
above  cell  (farthest  from  the  thermal  runaway  region)  should  be  the
lowest. This result suggests that combustion radiation, rather than heat
conduction,  plays  the  dominant  role  in  vertical  thermal  runaway
propagation.

In  addition  to  heat  transfer,  thermal  resistance  in  the  direction  of
thermal runaway  affects thermal runaway  propagation [146,153,157,
158].  Using  cell  gaps  and  insulation  materials  to  increase  thermal
resistance is an effective method for inhibiting thermal runaway.

4. Thermal runaway products and their characteristics and
formation

4.1. Characteristics and mechanisms of production of gases generated
during thermal runaway

Thermal runaway is accompanied by several hazardous phenomena,
such as fire, explosions, and vented combustible gases. On the basis of
their production mechanism, the vented gases can be broadly catego-
rized into two groups: those produced because of pressure or impact and
those  produced  through  electrolyte  decomposition  and  evaporation.
Both groups of gases frequently occur concurrently (Fig. 17).

Studies  have  revealed  that  the  vented  gases  mainly  comprise  ele-
ments produced through electrolyte decomposition [159,160]. Accord-
ingly, many researchers have attempted to enhance the thermal stability
and reduce the flammability of electrolytes. Because of their low cost,
low  viscosity,  high  solubility,  and  favorable  fire  resistance,  organic
phosphates are commonly added as flame retardants to the electrolytes
used  in  LIBs.  For  instance,  in  Ref.  [161],  a  1.0  M  LiPF6/trimethyl
phosphateâbased nonflammable electrolyte was designed and tested in
an LIB. In another study, approximately 30 % fluoroethyl carbonate was
incorporated into 0.8 M LiPF6/triethyl phosphate as a film-forming ad-
ditive  to  create  a  nonflammable  electrolyte  with  excellent  electro-
chemical  performance  [162].  Fluorine  is  an  excellent  chemical  for
preventing oxidization; therefore, fluorine is frequently used to create
nonflammable electrolytes [163â166].

Several  studies  have  examined  the  components  of  vented  gases
[167â169].  The  composition  of  such  gases  is  affected  by  the  battery
type, trigger conditions, gas collection method, and gas analysis tech-
nique. The gases emitted from a battery are primarily carbon monoxide,
carbon  dioxide,  hydrogen,  and  various  hydrocarbons  (e.g.,  CH4  and
C2H4).  Other  gases  detected  in  laboratory  testing  include  hydrogen
fluoride, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and volatile organic compounds.
Gases are emitted during thermal runaway as follows. First, an in-
crease  in  temperature  causes an  increase  in  air  pressure  (Pair),  which
leads to electrolyte evaporation and an increase in the partial pressure of
the electrolyte (Pelectrolyte). Subsequently, gases release through reaction
(partial pressure = Pgas) are produced. The total pressure in the battery
system is defined as follows:

Ptotal = Pair + Pelectrolyte + Pgas

(2)

Gas component analyses are typically conducted during failure tests,
such as thermal abuse, overcharging, and penetration tests. The char-
acteristics  of  the  gases  released  during  thermal  runaway  in  LIBs,
including  the  quantities  and  composition  of  these  gases,  are  directly
affected by factors such as the batteryâs active material, type, and SOC.
The total volume of the released gases is affected by the batteryâs
SOC and the test heating rate; however, the volume can differ by a factor
of eight in different tests [170]. For common cathode materials such as
NCM, LFP, and LCO, as the SOC increases, the H2  and CO proportions
increase, whereas the CO2  proportion decreases. In Ref. [171], similar
gas venting trends were obtained for lithium nickel manganese alumi-
nate (NCA) and LFP batteries, with higher SOC values resulting in higher
H2 and CO proportions but a lower CO2 proportion [171]. However, the
H2 content was higher for the LFP battery than for the NCA battery. In
Ref. [172], tests revealed that the mass loss for LFP batteries was similar
to  the  electrolyte  mass.  When  the  SOC  was  greater  than  40  %,  the
quantity of combustible gas produced markedly increased. A higher SOC
resulted  in  more  lithium  intercalation  on  the  anode  side,  which  pro-
moted gas production reactions and increased the complexity of the gas
composition.

After  the  occurrence  of  thermal  runaway,  LFP  and  NCM  batteries
release toxic gases, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, and
hydrogen cyanide [173]. In addition, NCM batteries generate more gas
than do LFP batteries; however, LFP batteries have a higher H2  ratio,
which can lead to a higher critical explosion limit [174]. The material

ratio of NCM cathodes does not considerably affect the composition of
vented gases.

Numerous researchers have discussed the effects of energy density
and  SOC  on  the  gases  released  during  the  occurrence  of  thermal
runaway in LIBs. The generated vented gases may vary even for the same
cathode  material  because  of  differences  in  the  electrolyte  base  and
manufacturing  processes  [175].  In  summary,  although  various  re-
searchers have performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of ven-
ted  gases,  these  analyses  have  been  mostly  limited  to  cylindrical  and
pouch-type  cells  subjected  to  thermal  abuse  and  overcharging.  Addi-
tional experiments are required to better understand the gas generation
process and develop improved safety strategies for a more diverse range
of  battery  combinations.  Furthermore,  the  vented  gases  are  typically
released  as  a  flame  jet;  thus,  accurately  determining  the  original  gas
components is challenging. Consequently, determined explosion limits
may be erroneous, and preventive strategies designed on the basis of the
aforementioned findings may be ineffective.

â¦

An overview of the gas generation process in different temperature
intervals is detailed as follows. At 60â80
C, the SEI layer decomposes,
leading  to  accumulation  of  gas  within  the  battery.  At  this  stage,  the
generated  gas  is  primarily  CO2,  CH4,  and  O2  [140,176].  As  the  tem-
perature  increases, further reactions  occur as  the intercalated  lithium
reacts  with  the  electrolyte  [177,178],  which  results  in  the  potential
release of C2H5, C2H6, and C3H6 [179,180]. Several reactions may occur
C,  including  SEI  decomposition,  ISC,  cathode
between  90  and  300
material decomposition, and electrolyte reactions. These reactions result
â¦
in the releases of gases such as O2, CO2, and CO [181]. Above 250
C, the
polyvinylidene  fluoride  binder  reacts  with  the  intercalated  lithium  to
produce  hydrogen.  This  chemical  reaction  can  be  observed  during
thermal runaway in NCM and LFP batteries.

4.2. Characteristics and production mechanisms of the solid ejecta
generated during thermal runaway

LIB venting is an intricate process. As thermal runaway progresses, a
jet  flow  begins  once  the  safety  valve  is  triggered  by  internal  over-
pressure. This multiphase flow initially comprises vented gas, liquids,
and solids, which are primarily decomposition gases, electrolyte drop-
lets, and solid particles, respectively. Such particulate matter has been
the subject of several studies and primarily comprises material from the
cathode, anode, and collectors on both sides. The characteristics of this
matter are affected by SOC and battery type.

In ref. [182], a battery module sourced from a commercial electric
vehicle was subjected to thermal runaway experiments. Soot contami-
nation  was  observed  in  these  experiments,  and  the  soot  primarily
comprised metal oxides from the cathode (approximately 18%â20 %),
lithium (3%â4%), and fluoride compounds (2.5 %). In Ref. [183], the
settleable  matter  released  during  thermal  runaway  reactions  in  com-
mercial batteries was investigated, and the observed particulate matter
was categorized into four groups on the basis of its size. Particles smaller
than 0.85 mm comprised 50 % of the particulate matter, and the total
particulate  matter  accounted  for  approximately  11.2  %  of  the  cellâs
entire mass. Further insights into the particulate matterâs composition
were gained through advanced experimental analysis, which revealed
that its main components were carbon, nickel, copper, cobalt, manga-
nese, aluminum, and lithium.

In  ref.  [184],  the  thermal  decomposition  of  a  50-Ah  commercial
prismatic battery with an NCM622 cathode was examined, and the mass,
particle size, and element distribution of the ejected solids were deter-
mined.  Particles  smaller  than  0.5  mm  constituted nearly  90  %  of  the
total particulate matter. In Ref. [185], red sparks were observed during
the initial venting process of a 21700 NCM battery; these sparks were
attributable  to  lithium  salt  (Li2CO3),  SEI  layer  decomposition,
carbonate-based  electrolyte  breakdown,  and  carbon-based  anode  re-
actions. The red sparks then transformed into brilliant incandescence,
which  was  attributable  to  the  burning  cathode  material,  and  finally

became a jet flame, which was believed to be generated by the release of
pressurized gas within the cell.

In  our  previous  study,  powder  ejecta  were  characterized  for  an
18650-cell  NCM  battery  under various  conditions,  including  different
SOC  values,  heating  power  levels,  and  ambient  environments.  The
ejected  powder  collected  after  thermal  runaway  predominantly
comprised  particles  smaller  than  0.3  mm.  The  particles  were  notably
larger  in  an  argon  atmosphere,  albeit  with  greater  deviation.  In  this
atmosphere, the ejecta primarily comprised carbon, organic chemicals,
carbonates,  metals,  metal  oxides,  and  various  impurities.  Qualitative
analysis  was  conducted  through  Fourier  transform  infrared  spectros-
copy, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction. The results
of the qualitative analysis revealed that the precise elemental compo-
sition was as follows: carbon, 79.4 %; aluminum, 5.7 %; nickel, 5.4 %;
manganese, 3.6 %; copper, 2.8 %; cobalt, 2.3 %; and phosphorous, 0.5 %
[186].

In ref. [187], CFD with a discrete phase model was employed to gain
comprehensive insights into the generation of ejecta, jetting mechanics,
and particle transport in LIBs. The results indicated that solid particle
generation proceeds in four stages (Fig. 18). In the first stage, the battery
is in its original state with its components intact, including the safety
valve  and  jelly  roll.  In  the  second  stage,  thermal  degradation  occurs,
which leads to substantial gas generation. Moreover, uneven pressure
and binder decomposition result in interparticle fracturing and pulver-
ization.  In  the  third  stage,  the  fragmented  electrode  material  is  dis-
placed, and gas pockets are propelled toward the headspace because of
airflow.  As  the  propelled  particles  approach  the  safety  valve,  they
accelerate  because  of  the  increased  momentum  at  the  nozzle  and  are
then  expelled  into  the  ambient  environment.  In  the  fourth  stage,

numerous  gas  pocket  channels  that  align  with  the  structure  of
spiral-wound  layers  are  created.  These  channels  can  be  observed  in
X-ray images [187â189].

5. Thermal runaway hazard evaluation methodologies

Because of the variety and complexity of LIB systems, identifying the
risk  of  thermal  runaway  in  these  systems  on  the  basis  of  a  single
parameter  is  impossible.  Therefore,  comprehensive  multiparameter
approaches are often used to identify such risk. In these approaches, data
on multiple parameters are collected and then used to conduct a safety
evaluation or management analysis to obtain a hazard level related to
thermal runaway. Finally, risk prediction is conducted, and suitable risk
reduction strategies are formulated. Fig. 19 displays the flowchart of a
comprehensive  multiparameter  approach  for  identifying  the  risk  of
thermal runaway in LIBs.

A multifactor method for evaluating the risk of thermal runaway was
developed in Ref. [190]. This method involves using a multiparameter
evaluation index system, fuzzy comparison matrix, and multiparameter
weighting system. In the aforementioned method, an analytical hierar-
chy process is combined with a triangular fuzzy method to assess the risk
and potential harm of thermal runaway. The analysis includes various
hazard factors and factors related to vented gases, such as the risks of jet
fires, high-temperature mixtures, and ejected powder. The method has
high  potential  for  application;  however,  its  effectiveness  should  be
verified through additional case studies. The analytic hierarchy process
can  also  be  combined  with  fault  tree  analysis  (FTA)  to  analyze  the
thermal safety of batteries [191]. FTA can be employed to examine the
root cause of electric car battery fires to identify basic events, minimum

cut sets, and suitable battery accident tests. The large quantities of data
collected in battery tests can be leveraged by comparing the importance
of every two tests with a judgment matrix to create an analytical hier-
archy.  This  approach  enables  the  comprehensive  mapping  of  battery
failure evolution and facilitates quantifiable safety evaluation testing for
automotive batteries.

In ref. [192], a dynamic Bayesian network, FTA, and support vector
regression were integrated into a dynamic risk prediction methodology
for  comprehensively  and  accurately  assessing  the  risk  of  thermal
runaway in LIBs, with the aim being to improve safety for certain battery
types and applications. In Ref. [193], an approach designed to assess the
risk  of  thermal  abuse  in  LIB  modules  and  packs  was  created  by  inte-
improved
grating  a  multiphysical  simulation  model  with  an
bisection-method-based  analysis  algorithm.  The  multiphysical  simula-
tion  model  was  employed  to  replicate  the  thermal  behavior  of  a  cell
under various operational conditions, and the simulation results were
then used to compute the rate of temperature rise and risk of thermal
runaway. The bisection method was employed to improve the accuracy
and efficiency of the risk assessment process. The effectiveness of the
aforementioned  method  was  demonstrated  in  a  case  study  for  an  LIB
pack; the predictions of thermal behavior and thermal abuse risk were
found to be accurate. In Ref. [9], the explosion behavior of large-format
LIBs was investigated, and a safety evaluation method and a manage-
ment  approach  based  on  the  sensitivity  and  severity  of  explosion  be-
haviors were proposed. Different runaway and failure parameters were
divided into five grades in a three-dimensional evaluation matrix on the
basis  of  characteristic  parameters.  A  method  for  evaluating  battery
safety through thermal analysis was proposed in Ref. [194]. The authors
of  the  aforementioned  study  created  a  safety  diagram  explaining  the
regulations and standards for assessing battery health. The diagram in-
dicates the critical temperature of a battery and includes standard test
conditions for rapidly evaluating thermal stability.

Deep-learning-based analysis of large-scale thermal runaway data is
also an effective method for predicting thermal runaway. In Ref. [195], a
framework  for  predicting  thermal  runaway  in  cylindrical  LIBs  was
developed  by  combining  multiphysical  modeling  with  deep  learning.
First, the effects of thermal runaway on the performance and safety of
LIBs were examined. Subsequently, the use of various physical modeling
methods  for  simulating  the  thermal  runaway  process  in  LIBs  was
explored. Deep learning technology was then used to increase the pre-
diction accuracy and efficiency of the aforementioned methods. Finally,
the validity and reliability of the overall framework in predicting ther-
mal  runaway  in  LIBs  were  verified  through  experiments.  In  another
study  from  Ref.  [196],  data-driven  and  model-based  algorithms  were
combined  to  obtain  accurate  early  warnings  of  thermal  runaway  in

batteries; the combined method achieved high accuracy in experiments.
In  the  combined  algorithm  developed  in  the  aforementioned  study,
k-means clustering was used to continuously obtain changes in battery
temperature, and the Bernardi equation was employed to continuously
obtain  the  difference  between  the  predicted  and  actual  temperature.
Subsequently,  a  support  vector  machine  was  used  to  determine  the
correct  weighting  ratio  to  identify  an  accurate  threshold  for  thermal
runaway  alarms.  In  Ref.  [197],  different  types  of  vehicle  fault  were
identified through deep mining and feature analysis of data on faulty
electric vehicles. The method proposed in the aforementioned study is
based  on  Shannon  entropy  and  can  be  used  to  predict  the  time  and
location of potential collisions during real-time electric vehicle moni-
toring. When the number of detected faulty batteries and the frequency
of  faulty  battery  detection  exceed  the  threshold  for  a  certain  day,  an
abnormal  vehicle  condition  is  identified,  following  which  voltage
anomalies are monitored and the risk of thermal runaway is predicted.
The real-time performance and feasibility of the aforementioned method
and  other  similar  algorithms  were  examined  using  temperature  and
insulation  resistance  data  detected  before  the  occurrence  of  thermal
runaway.

Because of the wide range of LIB applications, especially with the
advent  of  electric  vehicles,  battery  safety  requirements  are  becoming
increasingly  stringent.  Governments  and  organizations  regularly
formulate new and higher safety standards and regulations relating to
LIBs. These constantly updated standards and regulations can be inte-
grated into safety diagrams and charts for managing thermal runaway in
LIBs.  The  multiparameter  analysis  method  enables  comprehensive
consideration of various LIB parameters for evaluating the risk of ther-
mal  runaway  propagation  in  LIBs.  In  addition,  thermal  runaway  pre-
dictions enable potential battery problems to be identified in advance;
suitable measures can then be adopted to avoid thermal runaway. The
risk  of  thermal  runaway  propagation  can  be  evaluated  accurately  by
combining multiparameter analysis with thermal runaway prediction.
This combined method enables effective identification of potential paths
through which thermal runaway propagation can occur. Thus, appro-
priate measures can be designed in advance to reduce the probability of
thermal runaway and ensure the safety of LIB systems.

6. Countermeasures for lithium-ion battery thermal runaway

6.1. Improving the inherent safety of lithium-ion batteries

Commercial LIBs usually comprise a cathode material, anode mate-
rial,  electrolyte,  and  separator.  Excluding  cathodes  made  of  spinel,
which are used in LFP batteries, cathodes can react with the electrolyte

or  decompose  at  high  temperature,  releasing  oxygen  and  potentially
igniting  the  electrolyte.  Graphite,  which  is  widely  used  as  an  anode
material  in  LIBs,  can  also  react  with  the  electrolyte  and  release  heat
when subjected to high temperature. Commonly employed commercial
separatorsâwhich  are  typically  made  of  polypropylene  (PP),  poly-
ethylene  (PE),  or  a  blend  of  PP  and  PEâusually  shrink  and  melt  at
temperatures  of  approximately  120â160
C  [198],  which  exacerbates
the risk of ISC. Electrolytes typically comprise lithium salts and organic
carbonate  solvents.  Lithium  salts  decompose  as  the  temperature  in-
creases  [199],  and  organic  carbonate  solvents  are  flammable  when
heated. Because of these inherent safety defects, LIBs are susceptible to
thermal  runaway  under  abuse  conditions.  Consequently,  substantial
efforts have been directed toward enhancing the intrinsic safety of LIBs.

â¦

6.2. Improvements to cathode materials

The most common LIB cathode materials are LCO, LMO, LFP, NCM,
and  NCA.  Future  developments  in  battery  technology  might  facilitate
more advanced cathode materials, such as Li-rich materials and lithium
manganese iron phosphate, to reduce costs and increase energy capac-
ity.  Plenty  of  phosphate-based  cathode  materials,  such  as  LFP  and
LiV2(PO4)3,  have  high  thermal  stability.  These  materials  undergo
exothermic  reactions  with  the  electrolyte  up  to  temperatures  of
â¦
C; however, because such materials have stable PâO
approximately 300
bonds,  they  release  less  heat  than  do  conventional  cathode  materials
[200â204].  Therefore,  adopting  phosphate-based  cathodes  is  an  ideal
approach  for  improving  cathode  safety.  However,  the  low  voltage
plateau  of  these  cathodes  limits  the  specific  capacity  of  the  battery.
Element  doping  and  surface  coating  may  also  be  viable  methods  for

enhancing  the  thermal  safety  of  cathodes.  Substituting  aluminum,
magnesium,  or  manganese  in  LCO,  LNO,  or  NCM  batteries  can  sub-
stantially reduce the intensity of exothermic interactions occurring be-
tween  a  lithiated  cathode  and  an  electrolyte  [205â207].  The
accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) results obtained in Ref. [205] for
LiNi0.95M0.05O2  (M = Al, Mg, Mn, or Co) in an electrolyte at elevated
temperature [Fig. 20(a)] indicated that doped LNO materials are more
stable than are undoped LNO materials. In the aforementioned study,
thermal runaway was avoided across the entire test temperature range
for these samples. The electrochemical performance of a cathode can be
maintained  by  doping  it  with  aluminum,  magnesium,  or  manganese.
Although such doping causes a decrease in the initial discharge capacity,
it ensures a long cycle life. Moreover, the use of inexpensive aluminum,
magnesium, or manganese instead of lithium may reduce battery pro-
duction costs.

Surface  coatings  containing  thermally  or  chemically  inert  sub-
stances, such as fluoride, phosphate, or solid oxides, can be used as a
protective  layer  on  a  conventional  cathode  to  prevent  direct  contact
between the electrode and the electrolyte [208â212]. Such coatings not
only inhibit side reactions but also enhance the thermal stability of the
cathode.  Moreover,  a  suitable  coating  can  prevent  phase  transitions,
improve  structural stability, and inhibit  cathode degradation [Fig. 20
(b)]. Fig. 20(b) displays the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) re-
sults obtained in Ref. [208] for NCM622 cathodes with and without a
SiO2  coating. Because of the high thermal stability of SiO2  and its ca-
pacity for electrolyte isolation, the main exothermic peak of the coated
NCM622 cathode was at a temperature 15
C higher than that of the
uncoated cathode. Furthermore, the coated cathode released 35.3 % less
heat than did the uncoated sample. The SiO2-coated NCM622 cathode

also had superior electrochemical performance to that of the uncoated
cathode. Finally, increases in resistance and degradation were found to
decrease during long-term cycling.

6.3. Improvements to anode materials

Artificial graphite has high conductivity, favorable crystallinity, an
excellent layered structure, and low cost; therefore, artificial graphite is
the most widely used anode material for LIBs [213,214]. The safety of
graphite  can  be  enhanced  through  surface  modification  or  coating
[215].  Mild  oxidation  is  one  common  surface  modification  approach
that can enhance the thermal stability and electrochemical performance
of graphite [216]. In addition, the composition or structure of the SEI
layer  of  an  LIB  can  be  modified  by  coating  this  layer  with  a
single-component inorganic oxide or polymer coating, such as a coating
comprising Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, SiO2, a polyelectrolyte, or another con-
ducting polymer [217]. Fig. 21(a) displays the DSC curves obtained in
Ref.  [218]  for  fully  lithiated  graphite  with  versus  without  an  Al2O3
coating. The main exothermic peak of coated graphite occurred a tem-
perature 50

C higher than that of uncoated graphite.

â¦

In an LIB, graphite can be replaced with an alloyâsuch as Li7Ti5O12,
Li0.5VO2, or LiSi, to increase battery safety [219â223]. Fig. 21(b) depicts
the  self-heating  rate  profiles  obtained  in  Ref.  [220]  for  Li0.81C6,
Li7Ti5O12, and Li0.5VO2  when they reacted with EC/diethyl carbonate
(DEC) solvent at high temperature. The exothermic onset temperatures
C, respectively, with
for these three materials were 100, 130, and 230
the corresponding heat release being approximately 215, 110, and 54
kJ/mol,  respectively. Compared  with  Li0.81C6,  Li7Ti5O12  and  Li0.5VO2
had a higher exothermic onset temperature and released less heat, which
suggested  that  they  had  higher  thermal  stability  than  did  Li0.81C6.
Moreover, a thicker and more stable SEI layer can be generated on the
surface  of  LiSi  materials  to  hinder  the  electrolyte  reaction,  thereby
further inhibiting heat release [Fig. 21(c)] [221].

â¦

6.4. Improvements to electrolytes

A passivation layer typically develops on the surface of LIB electrode
materials, and this layer protects the electrodes of an LIB from direct
contact with the batteryâs electrolyte. At high temperature, the passiv-
ation layer decomposes, triggering side reactions and thermal runaway
[224,225].  Therefore,  ensuring  the  thermal  stability  of  passivation
layers is crucial for enhancing the overall thermal safety of LIBs. Because
passivation layers are products of reactions between the electrode ma-
terials  and  the  electrolyte,  passivation  stabilization  can  be  achieved
through electrolyte optimization [226,227].

The composition of the selected lithium salt considerably affects the
safety of LIBs [228â231]. Compared with LiPF6, lithium oxalate borate
(LiBOB) can enhance the safety of anode materials. Including LiBOB in
the electrolyte results in the formation of a more robust passivation film
on  LixC6,  which  causes  a  decrease  in  the  self-heating  rate  of  LixC6
[Fig. 22(a)] [232]. Battery safety can be further improved by blending
LiPF6  and  LiBOB  in  an  EC/DEC  solvent  [233].  Increasing  the  LiBOB
concentration  decreases  the  initial  peak  battery  temperature,  which
suggests that the suppression effect of LiPF6 is attributable to its reaction
with  LixC6.  Lithium  tetrafluoroborate  (LiBF4)  can  compromise  the
thermal stability of an LIB [228], as evidenced by its exothermic peak
occurring at a relatively low temperature. In Ref. [228], a LiBF4 sample
had a lower apparent activation energy than did a LiPF6 sample (0.65 vs.
1.69 eV), which indicates that LiBF4 is less stable than is LiPF6.

Researchers have also developed phosphate-based solvents, fluoride-
based solvents, sulfur-based solvents, and ionic liquids (ILs) to reduce
the  flammability  of  electrolytes  [236â243].  Of  these  options,
phosphate-based solvents have gained popularity because of their low
environmental  persistence,  toxicity,  and  bioaccumulation  potential
[244]. Organophosphorus compounds can decompose at high temper-
ature to generate hydrogen phosphate (H3PO4), which transforms into

The replacement of hydrogen atoms in solvents with fluorine atoms can
considerably  reduce  or  even  eliminate  the  presence  of  H  radicals,
leading  to  a  noncombustible  electrolyte  [245].  Therefore,  numerous
fluoride-based solvents containing conventional carbonates have been
proposed.  These  solvents  can  contribute  to  the  generation  of  robust
passivation layers on the electrode surface, thereby enhancing thermal
stability [246]. Several key fluoride-based solvents for LIBs are detailed
in Table 2. The sulfur atoms within sulfur-based solvents give electro-
lytes advantageous properties, such as a high flash point, low flamma-
bility, high anodic stability, and high oxidation stability [247]. Sulfone
is one of the most representative sulfur-based solvents used in LIBs and
enhances a batteryâs safety, especially at high voltage. Some common
sulfur-based solvents are listed in Table 2. Typically, ILs are liquid salts
at room temperature; they consist solely of anions and cations and thus
are  inherently  nonflammable  [248].  ILs  often  contain  elements  that
enhance  their  flame-retardant  properties,  such  as  halogens,  nitrogen,
phosphorus, or boron. Table 2 provides an overview of some leading ILs
in  this  category.  However,  ILs  have  high  viscosity,  which  can  reduce
ionic  conductivity  and  thus  make  it  difficult  to  operate  a  battery  in
high-power or low-temperature applications.

Finally, the introduction of appropriate additives to an electrolyte
can enhance the safety of LIBs by increasing the robustness of the formed
passivation  layer  and  stabilizing  the  electrodeâelectrolyte  interface
[249â251]. In Ref. [234], the introduction of 2 wt% vinylene carbonate
(VC),  methylene  methanesulfonate  (MMDS),  or  tris(trimethylsilyl)
phosphite  (TTSPi)  restrained  heat  release  from  the  contact  between
anode materials and the electrolyte over almost the entire investigated
temperature range [Fig. 22(b)]. The thermal performance of the elec-
trolytes containing the aforementioned materials was superior to that of
a  commercial  electrolyte.  Strategic  combinations  of  several  additives

can  also  substantially  enhance  the  thermal  stability  of  batteries.  For
example, in Ref. [235], 2 % VC + 1 % MMDS + 1 % TTSPi and 2 %
prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone  + 1  %  MMDS  + 1  %  TTSPi  blends  effectively
inhibited the decomposition of metastable components of the SEI layer
on  lithiated  graphite  at  approximately  100
C.  Furthermore,  the
self-heating rate of these blends remained lower than that of a control
sample  across  nearly  the  entire  investigated  temperature  range.  The
thermal stability of batteries was also affected by the amount of addi-
tives in the electrolyte. As depicted in Fig. 22(c), the exothermic peak
near 100
C was progressively suppressed as the VC concentration was
increased;  however,  the  self-heating  rate  increased  at  temperatures
above 130

C.

Over  the  past  decade,  solid-state  batteries  have  attracted  notable
scientific and commercial interest because of their advantageous prop-
erties, such as high energy density, high safety, and long life [252,253].
Battery structure can be considerably simplified by replacing traditional
flammable organic electrolytes with solid polymer electrolytes or inor-
ganic  solid  electrolytes.  Advanced  electrode  materials  with  a  wide
electrochemical window and high stability with lithium can be used for
solid-state  electrolytes  to  enhance  the  energy  density  of  batteries.  In
addition,  the  removal  of  reactive  liquid  electrolyte  improves  battery
safety.  However,  the  use of  solid-state  batteries  is  limited  by  aspects,
such  as  their  low  ionic  conductivity,  fabrication  difficulty,  and  low
solidâsolid  interface  compatibility,  which  may  cause  safety  issues
[254â256].  The  low  ionic  conductivity  and  solid-solid  interface
compatibility  may  induce  the  generation  of  lithium  dendrite,  and
fabrication  defects  may  cause  hidden  safety  hazards.  Moreover,  the
brittleness  of  solid-state  electrolytes  results  in  their  deformation  or
cracking  during  usage,  which  poses  a  potential  safety  hazard.  Thus,
more  advanced  materials  should  be  developed  to  realize  competitive
solid-state batteries.

6.5. Separator improvement

â¦

The separator between the cathode and anode provides pathways for
migration of Li-ions during charging and discharging. At high temper-
ature,  the  separator shrinks and  melts, which  induces  ISC and poten-
tially leads to a severe thermal hazard. Therefore, the thermal stability
of the separator has a crucial effect on battery safety. Commercial sep-
arators  are  typically  made  from  PP  or  PE,  which  have  low  melting
temperatures of 165 and 135
C, respectively, and thus are sensitive to
high temperature. Two mainstream approaches exist for enhancing the
thermal stability of separators: (i) modifying commercial separators and
(ii) replacing PP and PE with high-melting-point materials. A popular
modification  strategy  involves  employing  a  multilayered  structure  to
block the pathway of lithium ion flow through the separator under abuse
conditions  [257].  For  example,  for  a  PP/PE/PP  configuration,  the
separator initially melts when the melting point of PE is reached in the
battery [Fig. 23(a)]. This melting results in closure of the middle pores of
the separator, thus effectively preventing ISC [258]. Another common
modification  approach  involves  coating  the  PP  or  PE  structure  with
inorganic ceramic nanoparticles [259â262], such as SiO2 nanoparticles,
or  embedding  these  nanoparticles  into  the  structure.  The  aforemen-
tioned  nanoparticles  have  an  ultrahigh  melting  point  and  excellent
mechanical properties; thus, they can considerably enhance the thermal
stability of commercial separators. The nanoparticles can also increase
the separatorsâ mechanical strength, conductivity, and wettability.

High-melting-point  battery  separators,  such  as  porous  membranes
comprising polyesters, cellulose, or polyimide are alternatives to PP and
PE  separators  [263â267].  Polyesters,  cellulose,  and  polyimide  have
various  advantages,  such  as  high  thermal  stability,  tensile  strength,
electrolyte  wettability,  and  flame  retardancy.  Polyimide  was  success-
fully used as an alternative to PP and PE battery separators in Ref. [264].
In  the  aforementioned  study,  no  endothermic  peak  corresponding  to
polymer melting was observed for a polyimide separator over the entire
scanning range [Fig. 23(b)]. By contrast, strong endothermic peaks at

24

â¦

C were discovered for PP and PE separa-
approximately 160 and 140
tors,  respectively.  The  polyimide  separator  maintained  its  stability
C during thermogravi-
without mass loss up to a temperature of 400
metric  analysis  [Fig.  23(c)],  whereas  the  PP  separator  maintained  its
stability without mass loss up to a temperature of only 230

C.

6.6. Early warning of the occurrence of thermal runaway in lithium-ion
battery

The occurrence of an impending thermal runaway event in an LIB
can be avoided if early warning is available. Numerous studies have used
several  LIB  monitoring  techniques  to  detect  the  potential  for  thermal
runaway  and  assess  thermal  runaway  signals.  Scholars  and  engineers
have designed models to predict thermal runaway events, with many of
these  models  using  data-driven  methods  on  large  experimental  and
simulation data sets.

6.6.1. Characteristics of thermal runaway signals

Researchers  have  tracked  acoustic,  temperature,  electrical,  me-
chanical,  and  gas  signals  to  identify  early  warning  signs  of  thermal
runaway  in  LIBs  [8].  For  example,  a  safety  alert  approach  based  on
acoustic signals produced during venting was proposed in Ref. [268] for
stations storing multiple megawatts of energy. In addition, a denoising
method based on spectral subtraction was developed. In Ref. [269], an
acoustic sensor was incorporated into a battery compartment and used
to  identify  the  sound  produced  when  a  safety  valve  opens.  In  the
aforementioned study, thermal runaway was identified on the basis of
metrics such as the signal arrival time, difference in arrival time, and
strength of the received signal.

Researchers have also investigated the use of sensors such as ther-
mocouples  and  infrared  thermal  imagers  for  detecting  temperature
signals during thermal runaway in batteries. Internal optical-fiber-based
hybrid sensors for strain measurement and temperature differentiation
were  investigated  in  Ref.  [270].  The  authors  of  the  aforementioned
study proposed a hybrid sensing network comprising fiber Bragg grat-
ings and FabryâPerot cavities. Modified optical-fiber sensors were also
used to monitor the distributed in-situ operating temperatures of a cy-
lindrical  18650-cell  LIB  [271].  Through  electrochemical  impedance
spectroscopy (EIS), CT scanning, and battery cycling characterizations,
the aforementioned authors demonstrated that the sensors had a negli-
gible  effect  on  the  batteryâs  electrochemical  performance.  Impedance
monitoring  is  often  used  to  identify  potential  battery  hazards  from
electrical signals. In Ref. [272], tests involving the stepwise loading of
18650  batteries  with  various  impactors  (nails,  cylindrical  impactors,
and hemispheric impactors) and EIS measurements were conducted to
explore  useful  indicators  for  anticipating  hazardous  battery  events.
Moreover, in Ref. [82], an impedance-based approach was developed to
characterize the heat production in batteries during overcharging. Ar-
ranging the required external excitation sources in a reasonable manner
and reducing engineering costs are crucial for the commercial utilization
of impedance monitoring. Mechanical signals are generated from the gas
impulse  pressure  formed  in  a  battery  during  thermal  runaway.  Two
pressure shocks occur during thermal runaway in prismatic cells [81]. A
study  assessed  the  characteristics  of  the  impact  pressures  generated
during  thermal  runaway  to  determine  their  associated  injury  risks
[273].  The  assessment  indicated  that  the  release  of  overpressure  is
characterized  by  intense  oscillation,  particularly  at  high  SOC  values,
which  suggests  that  pressure  monitoring  is  an  effective  method  for
detecting  thermal  runaway.  Various  scholars  have  examined  the  gas
production in LIBs experiencing thermal runaway [168,169,274,275].
The  side  reactions  occurring  during  thermal  runaway  result  in  the
generation of H2, CO, CO2, and C2H4 [273]; thus, the presence of these
molecules is a warning sign of thermal runaway.

6.6.2. Data-driven thermal runaway warning systems

Models for predicting thermal runaway in batteries can be trained on

data  such  as  experimental  temperature  and  voltage  measurements
through  machine  learning  methods  [276â278].  In  Ref.  [279],  a
data-driven  approach  was  developed  for  diagnosing  faults  in  electric
vehicle batteries and predicting thermal runaway. In addition to tem-
perature and voltage signal anomalies, changes in the discrete Frechet
distance and local outlier factor, which are correlated with temperature
and voltage, can indicate the potential occurrence of thermal runaway.
Meta-TRFNN,  which  is  a  meta-learning-based  neural  network,  was
proposed  in  Ref.  [280]  for  forecasting  multi-step-ahead  thermal
runaway  states  at  the  cell  level  from  not  only  low-dimensional  tem-
perature  and  voltage  data  but  also  high-dimensional  thermal  images,

machine-learning-based two-layer model was proposed in Ref. [281] for
diagnosing overdischarge faults in the LIBs used in electric vehicles. The
extent  of  battery  damage  was  determined  from  the  severity  of  the
overdischarge. An electrothermal coupling simulation model was con-
structed  in  Ref.  [282]  for  predicting  thermal  runaway  propagation;
experimental data and public data sets were used for model training and
validation.  To  enhance  the  modelâs  adaptability, a  switching  strategy
was devised, with the model transitioning to a long short-term memory

Methods for predicting thermal runaway in LIBs mainly rely on an
understanding  of  battery  electrochemistry  and  the  development  of
extensive battery  data models.  Early indicators of  impending  thermal
runaway  include  specific  acoustic,  temperature,  gas,  mechanical,  and
electrochemical  impedance  signals.  For  example,  the  early  stages  of
thermal runaway can be identified through real-time monitoring of the
gases emitted by the battery. Furthermore, EIS can be conducted to es-
timate  the  batteryâs  internal  temperature  from  the  impedance  phase-
shift  frequency  and  to  detect  battery  overcharge  by  observing  a  shift
in  the  dynamic  impedance  slope  within  a  specific  frequency  range;  a
change from a negative slope to a positive one indicates overcharging.
However,  the  aforementioned  mechanical  and  gas  signals  typically
indicate  that  thermal  runaway  is  rapidly  reaching  a  critical  point.
Therefore, methods for detecting these signals should be integrated with
fire suppression and explosion mitigation strategies to effectively pre-
vent thermal runaway in batteries.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based thermal runaway prediction models
have progressed from threshold boundary models to statistical models
and then to machine learning and deep learning models. AI approaches
have been employed to analyze real vehicle data, thermal runaway re-
cords,  and  fault  injection  simulation  data.  However,  applying  fault
diagnosis algorithms for batteries is challenging. Batteries are intricate,
dynamic systems, with the parameter thresholds for thermal runaway
differing  with battery  type and  battery age.  Real-time model applica-
tions require further research. Moreover, battery fault diagnosis algo-
rithms  are  typically  trained  on  idealized  data  and  thus  may  not  be
applicable in real-world scenarios. In summary, the accuracy of battery

fault  detection  models  must  be  improved.  External  signal  monitoring
and  computer  prediction  models  can  be  combined  to  identify  more
suitable  electrochemical  parameters  and  boundary  conditions  for
achieving more accurate predictions of thermal runaway in batteries.

6.7. Barriers to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries

Few studies have investigated barriers to thermal runaway in LIBs.
However, such barriers may be essential for absorbing the heat produced
by cells and preventing heat transfer between them. Research on bar-
riers to thermal runaway has predominantly focused on heat-absorbing
phase change materials (PCMs) and insulating aerogels.

6.7.1. Phase change materials for inhibiting thermal runaway in lithium-ion
batteries

Although PCMs can absorb some of the heat released by batteries,
they can also exacerbate the intensity of thermal runaway because of
their intrinsic flammability. Consequently, novel PCMs with low ther-
mal conductivity and flame-retardant properties have been developed to
curb the onset and spread of battery thermal runaway [283â286]. These
flame-retardant  PCMs  can  be  integrated  with  other  thermal  manage-
ment  techniques  to  enhance  resistance  to  thermal  runaway.  For
example,  in  Ref.  [287],  PCMs  were  integrated  with  a  liquid  cooling
system  for  heat  dissipation  to  develop  an  innovative  hybrid  thermal
management  system  for  batteries.  In  this  system,  PCMs  act  as  a  heat
buffer, whereas the liquid cooling system performs primary heat dissi-
pation. Similarly, a heat dissipation mechanism combining PCMs with
heat pipes was developed in Ref. [288], and its efficacy was assessed
during abnormal heating and thermal runaway scenarios.

6.7.2. Aerogel materials for preventing thermal runaway in lithium-ion
batteries

â¦

Most barrier materials for preventing thermal runaway in LIBs are
commercial aerogel felts. However, lab-synthesized aerogel and hydro-
gel materials have also received attention because of their potential for
high performance. For example, a naturally derived thermal barrier was
developed using fiber-reinforced hydrogel (Fig. 24) in Ref. [289]. When
the  battery  temperature  exceeded  100
C,  this  barrier  absorbed  heat
through hydrogel gasification, and the fibrous insulation material inside
the  hydrogel  blocked  intercell  heat  transfer.  The  thermal  runaway
suppression  effects  of  nickel  foam,  glass  wool,  and  aerogel  felt  for
various battery arrangements were compared in Ref. [290]. The insu-
lating effects achieved by coupling these materials with water mist were
investigated, and aerogel felt exhibited the highest performance of all
the investigated materials. Another study reported that neither an aer-
ogel nor a liquid-cooled plate alone could effectively inhibit the prop-
agation of thermal runaway in an LIB but their combination did have
favorable thermal runaway inhibition performance [291]. In Ref. [292],
a  battery  barrier  with  a  copper/aerogel  sandwich  structure  was

designed, and the heat conduction, heat convection, and heat radiation
in battery systems containing this structure were assessed. The afore-
mentioned structure was found to extend the thermal runaway propa-
gation time from 1384 to 21,600 s.

Silica aerogel is commonly used as a thermal insulation material in
LIBs.  This  material  is  an  impeccable  thermal  insulator  because  it  has
extremely low thermal conductivity; however, it collapses structurally at
â¦
approximately 600
C or
higher  during  thermal  runaway.  Therefore,  aerogel  materials  with
higher heat resistance must be developed to prevent thermal runaway.
Some researchers have used combinations of PCMs with aerogel skele-
tons to leverage the flame retardancy and structural stability of PCMs.

â¦
C, and the temperatures in LIBs can reach 800

A study explored the combined effects of liquid cooling and PCMs in
18650-cell battery packs [294]. In the aforementioned study, increasing
the coolant flow rate from 0.009 to 0.029 m/s extended the duration of
thermal  runaway  propagation  by  a  factor  of  1.84,  with  the  greatest
extension in this duration being obtained at cells located on opposite
sides. Moreover, increasing the cell spacing from 0.3 to 0.9 mm extended
the  duration  of  thermal  runaway  propagation  by  a  factor  of  1.47.  A
decrease  in  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  PCM  delayed  thermal
runaway by reducing heat transfer, and the addition of more aluminum
channels  slightly  reduced  the  thermal  runaway  time.  These  results
highlight  the  importance  of  optimizing  multiple  factors  together  to
optimize thermal runaway suppression.

6.7.3. Alternative barriers to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries

Despite their effectiveness in preventing the propagation of thermal
runaway in LIBs, PCMs and aerogels alone may not completely suppress
thermal runaway, especially in extreme environments. To address this
problem, researchers have attempted to develop alternative barriers to
thermal runaway in batteries.

Liquid cooling plates have emerged as prominent advanced tools for
inhibiting thermal runaway in LIBs. These plates can markedly improve
thermal management within battery modules, and in Ref. [293], they
increased the thermal runaway initiation time by 15.4 %, reduced the
peak  temperature  by  18.6  %,  and  extended  the  duration  of  thermal
runaway  propagation  between  cells  by  21.3  %.  Moreover,  the  afore-
mentioned plates redistributed 38.7 % of the generated heat away from
critical cell interfaces, thereby effectively reducing the amount of heat
transferred  to  neighboring  cells.  Thus,  liquid  cooling  plates  have
considerable potential to delay thermal runaway and enhance battery
safety. The risk of thermal runaway in LIBs can be effectively suppressed
by  combining  aerogel  insulation  with  liquid  cooling  plates.  In
Ref. [291], the use of 1-mm-thick aerogel insulation alone resulted in the
duration of thermal runaway propagation increasing from 84.6 to 386 s;
however, the propagation of thermal runaway was not completely pre-
vented.  Moreover,  the  use  of  liquid  cooling  alone  was  ineffective  in
preventing  the  propagation  of  thermal  runaway  because  it  increased
heat  conduction.  However,  the  combination  of  aerogel  with  liquid
cooling plates successfully prevented thermal runaway by delaying heat
transfer and dissipating heat, thus ensuring battery safety.

â¦

â¦

The combined effects of aluminum plates and liquid cooling plates in
LIBs have been explored. In Ref. [295], a 3.2-mm-thick aluminum plate
prevented  the  propagation  of  thermal  runaway  by  ensuring  that  the
temperatures  of  adjacent  cells  were  maintained  below  210
C.
Conversely, a 0.8-mm-thick aluminum plate allowed cell temperatures
C, leading to cascading failures. The thicker aluminum
to exceed 500
plateâs  superior  heat  dissipation  and  reduction  of  local  hotspots  indi-
cated  its  effectiveness  in  preventing  thermal  runaway  and  thus
enhancing  battery  safety.  A  flame-retardant  epoxy  resin  board  with
phosphorus-doped MoS2  was developed in Ref. [296] to mitigate ther-
mal runaway in batteries. This 3-mm-thick board reduced the peak HRR
and peak carbon monoxide production during thermal runaway by 56.7
% and 56.6 %, respectively. The board effectively halted the propaga-
tion  of  thermal  runaway,  ensuring  that  cell  temperatures  remained
below 100
C without causing major changes in internal battery prop-
erties;  thus,  it  represents  an  advanced  solution  for  enhancing  battery
safety.

â¦

Each  barrier  material  offers  distinct  benefits  for  mitigating  the
propagation of thermal runaway. Liquid cooling plates improve thermal
management, aluminum plates enhance heat dissipation, aerogels and
PCMs  ensure  effective  insulation  and  heat  absorption,  and  flame-
retardant  epoxy  resin  boards  offer  additional  protection.  Future
research should focus on optimizing these materials and exploring their
combined  effects  under  various  operational  conditions  to  further
enhance battery safety and performance.

6.8. Methods for extinguishing fires caused by thermal runaway in
lithium-ion batteries

Fire-extinguishing methods can be used as the final countermeasure
for reducing the severity and propagation of thermal runaway in LIBs.
Numerous  researchers  have  investigated  battery  fires  and  agents  for
extinguishing such fires. These fire-extinguishing agents can be classi-
fied into water-based and non-water-based agents.

6.8.1. Water-based agents

Water is considered the most effective fire-extinguishing agent and
refrigerant for LIBs because of its low price and high heat absorption
[297].  In  Ref.  [298],  although  1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane
(HFC-227ea)  and  perfluorohexanone  (C6F12O)  effectively  inhibited
heat  transfer,  they  could  not  completely  suppress  the  propagation  of
thermal  runaway;  sprayed  water  outperformed  these  substances  in
suppressing such propagation. In Ref. [299], additive-containing water
mist was used to inhibit the propagation of thermal runaway in batteries
(Fig. 25). The adopted additives increased the specific surface area of
water  mist,  and,  in  combination  with  flame  retardants,  reduced  the
fire-extinguishing time. However, prolonged application of water mist
may  lead  to  SC  in  surrounding  undamaged  cells.  Therefore,  a
low-conductivity water-mist-based fire-extinguishing agent that reduces
the intensity and inhibits the propagation of thermal runaway in bat-
teries was developed in Ref. [300]. Researchers have been increasingly
exploring  the  use  of  various  fire-extinguishing  agents  in  combination
with water mist to address thermal runaway and its propagation in LIBs
[301â303].

6.8.2. Non-water-based agents

Studies have examined the thermal runaway suppression effects of
several  promising  non-water-based  fire-extinguishing  agents,  such  as
dry  powder,  CO2,  heptafluoropropane,  perfluorohexanone,  and  liquid
nitrogen. These agents are applied using microcapsules inside batteries,
or they are applied externally. In Ref. [304], ABC dry powder, BC ul-
trafine dry powder, and NOVEC 1230 were found to be ineffective in
halting the propagation of thermal runaway in LIBs; however, NOVEC
1230 inhibited flame growth and the release of toxic gases. The inhib-
itory effect of HFC-227ea on thermal runaway in LIBs was investigated
under  various  dosages,  spraying  methods,  and  spraying  times  in  one
study from Ref. [305]. In another study [306], liquid nitrogen effectively
hindered thermal runaway in batteries. Moreover, the performance of
liquid nitrogen in suppressing thermal runaway in LIBs was systemati-
cally investigated under various heating power values, spray directions,

charging  states,  and  spray  times  in  Ref.  [307].  A  microcapsule-based
fire-extinguishing  agent  with  a  coreâshell  structure  was  developed  in
Ref.  [308].  In  this  structure,  the  shell  comprised  melamine-
âureaâformaldehyde  resin,  and
the  core  comprised  perfluoro
(2-methyl-3-pentanone)  and  heptafluorocyclopentane.  The  aforemen-
â¦
C in only 10 s. As depicted
tioned agent cooled a battery from 800 to 30
in Fig. 26, in Ref. [309], a fire-extinguishing agent was integrated into a
battery  in  the  form  of  microcapsules  and  effectively  improved  the
self-extinguishing  performance  of  the  battery  without  affecting  its
electrochemical performance. Furthermore, this agent was effective for
fire suppression during nail penetration tests.

Although non-water-based extinguishing agents have been proven to
be effective for extinguishing open fires in LIBs, they have some draw-
backs,  including  risks  of  secondary  explosion  of  dry  powder,  battery
reignition,  suffocation,  and  environmental  toxicity.  Moreover,  water-
based  fire-extinguishing  agents  typically  have  superior  efficiency  and
cooling  effects  than  do  non-water-based  extinguishing  agents.  Water-
based approaches for fire suppression include using pure water spray,
fine  water  mist,  and  additive-containing  water  spray.  However,  few
studies have investigated the effect of water on batteries before thermal
runaway  occurs  or  the  energy  required  to  deploy  water-based  fire-
extinguishing agents in real-world scenarios. In future studies, additives
can  be  used  to  reduce  the  electrical  conductivity  of  water,  thus  miti-
gating  the  adverse effects  of  water-based  fire-extinguishing agents  on
batteries and circuits.

7. Challenges and future perspectives

Safety concerns related to LIBs have attracted attention in academia
and  industry.  However,  universally  accepted  methods  of  conducting
thermal  runaway  tests  and  evaluating  battery  risks  are  lacking.  In
particular, in China, which is the largest market for LIB production and
usage, research on thermal runaway in LIBs has been disorganized and
fragmented.  Each  institution  or  researcher  tends  to  adopt  their  own
criteria  for  assessing  thermal  runaway,  leading  to  confusion  and  hin-
dering a comprehensive comparison of thermal runaway behaviors and
hazards for various types of LIBs. This lack of standardization has also
resulted  in  redundant  thermal  runaway  tests,  which  lead  to  resource
wastage. Therefore, a widely accepted criterion for thermal runaway in
LIBs  is  urgently  required.  Such  a  criterion  should  be  developed  by
considering various factors, such as the components, formats, applica-
tion  scenarios,  and  electrochemical  characteristics  of  LIBs.  This
endeavor requires close collaboration between academia and industry.
The most effective strategy for mitigating thermal runaway in LIBs is

27

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101209

to  prevent  its  occurrence.  Thus,  early  warning  systems  for  thermal
runaway are of utmost importance. Currently, systems for warning of
thermal runaway rely on using battery management systems to detect
the temperature and voltage parameters of LIBs. However, the accuracy
and efficiency of these warning systems often fall short of market de-
mands. The efficiency of the aforementioned systems can be improved
by  effectively  monitoring  daily  battery  data,  accurately  identifying
abnormal patterns in battery parameters, and taking necessary actions
promptly  when  required.  In  addition,  comprehensive  analysis  and
assessment based on multiple parameters, such as voltage, resistance,
temperature, sound, gas, pressure, and stress, during the progression of
thermal runaway in an LIB can be conducted to substantially enhance
the  effectiveness  of  early  warning  systems.  The  development  of  a
mechanism for mapping internal to external battery parameters, such as
internal  battery  temperature  to  external  temperature,  could  consider-
ably improve warning systems. Such a mechanism would enable internal
battery  parameters  to  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  external  signals,
thereby  enhancing  the  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and  cost  of  early
warning systems. In summary, innovative technologies that can provide
advanced warning of potential thermal runaway in LIBs, ideally with a
20-min lead time, are urgently required.

Finally, developing an efficient fire-extinguishing system is essential
for effectively suppressing fires in LIBs and minimizing the losses caused
by such fires. The fire-extinguishing agent used in such a system should
have robust cooling capability; ideally, it should have a latent heat of
vaporization exceeding 1500 kJ/kg as well as long-lasting adherence to
battery  surfaces.  Moreover,  this  agent  should  be  effective  at  extin-
guishing class A, B, E, and F fires. The fire-extinguishing agent should
also be able to absorb the explosive or flammable gases produced during
thermal  runaway  through  physical  or  chemical  methods  to  hinder
combustion and explosion. Moreover, seamless coordination is required
among  various  components  of  a  fire-extinguishing  systemâits  alarm
unit, agent system, spraying devices, and other relevant subsystemsâto
ensure complete utilization of the agentâs fire-extinguishing capabilities.

8. Conclusions

Given the increasing worldwide efforts toward decarbonization, the
use  of  LIBs  in  industry  and  everyday  life  is  expected  to  increase
considerably. Therefore, safety concerns associated with LIBs, particu-
larly  thermal  runaway,  must  be  addressed.  Consequently,  extensive
research should be conducted to obtain a comprehensive understanding
of the characteristics, mechanisms, and propagation of thermal runaway
in  LIBs,  methods  for  evaluating  this  phenomenon,  and  strategies  for
mitigating the phenomenon.

Regardless of whether mechanical, electrical, or thermal factors are
involved, the root cause of thermal runaway in an LIB is an imbalance
between heat generation and heat dissipation within the battery. As the
batteryâs  temperature  increases,  side  reactions  occur  among  various
battery  components,  such  as  the  electrolyte,  cathode  material,  anode
material,  binder,  and  separator.  These  reactions  steadily  promote
further temperature increases and the generation of toxic, flammable, or
explosive  substances.  The  released  heat  is  then  transferred  to  sur-
rounding cells through conduction, convection, and radiation.

The balance between heat transfer and heat dissipation plays a vital
role  in  determining  whether  thermal  runaway  propagates.  Thermal
runaway and its propagation are influenced by various factors, including
battery-specific  factors  and  environmental  factors.  The  products  of
thermal  runaway  include  gases  and  solids.  During  thermal  runaway,
gases that are highly likely to be explosive or combustible are produced
through  side  reactions  between  the  electrolyte  and  electrodes  and
through evaporation of the electrolyte. Moreover, gas release is often
accompanied by pressure shocks. The solids produced during thermal
runaway are mainly powdery electrode materials that are ejected from
the battery; these materials can be highly toxic to humans.

A  multiparameter  evaluation  method  involving  data  collection,

model integration, and risk prediction must be employed to evaluate the
hazards  associated  with  thermal  runaway.  However,  accurately  pre-
dicting  the  risk  of  thermal  runaway  is  challenging  because  of  the
complexity  of  LIB  systems  and  their  thermal  runaway  behaviors.
Developing  battery  components  with  enhanced  safety  features  is  the
most effective approach for overcoming the challenges posed by thermal
runaway. Moreover, warning systems, barriers to thermal runaway, and
fire-extinguishing systems are key for preventing thermal runaway di-
sasters and minimizing the losses caused by thermal runaway.

The LIB market is trending toward the development of batteries with
larger formats and capacities to achieve higher energy density; thus, the
challenge of thermal runaway in LIBs is expected to grow larger in the
future. Higher energy density results in higher  probability of thermal
runaway  and  its  propagation  and  the  release  of  a  higher  quantity  of
materials with higher energy. Therefore, improving the safety of LIBs is
essential, and advanced battery technologies, such as aqueous batteries
and solid-state batteries, must be urgently developed. In addition, bat-
tery  management  (e.g.,  battery  condition  monitoring,  thermal  man-
agement,  and  detection  of  possible  thermal  runaway)  should  be
improved to prevent thermal runaway accidents during the lifespan of
LIBs. Finally, when thermal runaway results in a battery fire or explo-
sion,  a  suitable  fire-extinguishing  agent  should  be  used  swiftly  to
minimize the consequences and losses.
