Metal fuels, as recyclable carriers of clean energy, are promising alternatives to fossil fuels in a future low-
carbon economy. Fossil fuels are a convenient and widely-available source of stored solar energy that have
enabled our modern society; however, fossil-fuel production cannot perpetually keep up with increasing
energy demand, while carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel combustion cause climate change. Low-
carbon energy carriers, with high energy density, are needed to replace the multiple indispensable roles of
fossil fuels, including for electrical and thermal power generation, for powering transportation fleets, and
for global energy trade. Metals have high energy densities and metals are, therefore, fuels within many bat-
teries, energetic materials, and propellants. Metal fuels can be burned with air or reacted with water to
release their chemical energy at a range of power-generation scales. The metal-oxide combustion products
are solids that can be captured and then be recycled using zero-carbon electrolysis processes powered by
clean energy, enabling metals to be used as recyclable zero-carbon solar fuels or electrofuels. A key techno-
logical barrier to the increased use of metal fuels is the current lack of clean and efficient combustor/reac-
tor/engine technologies to convert the chemical energy in metal fuels into motive or electrical power
(energy). This paper overviews the concept of low-carbon metal fuels and summarizes the current state of
our knowledge regarding the reaction of metal fuels with water, to produce hot hydrogen on demand, and
the combustion of metal fuels with air in laminar and turbulent flames. Many important questions regard-
ing metal-fuel combustion processes remain unanswered, as do questions concerning the energy-cycle effi-
ciency and life-cycle environmental impacts and economics of metals as recyclable fuels. Metal fuels can be
an important technology option within a future low-carbon society and deserve focused attention to
address these open questions.

1. Energy and climate problems and solutions

Multiple indicators of quality of life, from reduced childhood mal-
nutrition to increased gender equality [1], correlate directly with how
much energy is harnessed by a society per person, as well as how effi-
cient that society is in converting that energy into useful products and
services that improve living conditions [1(cid:1)6]. Energy is needed to pro-
duce and transport all raw materials and manufactured goods, to pro-
vide all services, and underpins all economic activity and wealth
creation [5]. The average citizen of a (energy) rich country takes
advantage of around 80 times more energy than is produced by their
own metabolisms, a feat enabled by our access to fossil fuels [5].

The global economy is currently driven by the international pro-
duction, trade, and consumption of fossil fuels because they: are rel-
atively cheap and have been readily available, are energy dense, can
be burned in internal-combustion engines at high power densities,

and are easily transportable and relatively safe to handle. The
impressive energy density of fossil fuels can be appreciated by con-
sidering the fact that a teaspoonful of hydrocarbon fuel contains
chemical energy, when burned with air, equal to the kinetic energy
of a 1000 kg automobile travelling at 100 km/hr [7].

1.1. Climate change and fossil energy resources

Unfortunately, combustion of fossil hydrocarbon fuels produces
carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change [8(cid:1)10]. Limiting
anthropogenic global warming to 2 °C requires limiting consumption
of fossil energy sources, which would also limit our future economic
growth [8,11], leaving a gap that must be filled through development
of renewable energy sources [10].

Meanwhile, we may have already passed the peak in conven-
tional crude oil production, or Peak Oil [4,12,13], and may soon be

J.M. Bergthorson / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 169(cid:1)196

171

nearing Peak Coal [13(cid:1)15] and Peak Natural Gas [13,15], such that
alternative energy sources will be needed for global economic devel-
opment to continue even if climate change was not a concern [4,15].
While there remain significant deposits of unconventional oil and
gas [16,17], these resources typically have high carbon footprints
and provide low Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROI) [1,4,6]
and, as such, are poor long-term energy investments.

In order to mitigate global climate change, we must achieve net-
zero carbon emissions from our energy and transportation systems
and transition to a low-carbon or zero-carbon society [3]. A low-car-
bon society will require a variety of clean energy solutions to replace
the multitude of roles that fossil fuels currently play in our global
economy.

1.2. Bioenergy and biofuels

Biofuels are secondary energy carriers of the primary solar flux
that mesh well with our existing transportation infrastructure and
vehicles while promising to lower the net carbon footprint [18(cid:1)20].
Biomass pellets can be traded globally and are used to offset coal
consumption in power-generation applications [21(cid:1)23]. Biomass
dusts or slurries have even been proposed to fuel internal-combus-
tion compression-ignition engines [24].

Biomass from low-net-carbon feedstocks, such as municipal and
other wastes, residual biomass, or bio-energy crops grown on mar-
ginal land, can provide significant carbon-emission reductions for
stationary power generation [21,23,25], or can be upgraded using
advanced conversion technologies into biofuels that can potentially
have a low carbon footprint compared to current petroleum fuels
[26,27]. Biomass and biofuels are considered low-carbon fuels
because the carbon dioxide they emit when burned had recently
been absorbed from the atmosphere by the plants or trees that grew
to create the fuel [21,23,28].

While some estimates suggest that current transportation fuel
demand could be supplied by bioenergy in 2050, mainly through a
significant increase in the dedicated production of energy crops on
marginal land [29], many other estimates indicate that only a frac-
tion of our current and future energy needs could be replaced by
bio-derived energy [3,22,30(cid:1)33]. This is due, primarily, to the low
energy density, or productivity, of photosynthesis per footprint of
land used [33]. More of the global bio-energy potential can be eco-
nomically utilized as costs increase, which can lead to increased con-
cerns regarding secondary land use and other sustainability issues
[31]. If biofuels are produced unsustainably, where forests are effec-
tively “mined” of their biomass, the net result is an increase in atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide that is hardly different from the use of fossil
fuels. Clearing land of its existing vegetation incurs a carbon debt
that may be difficult to pay off [34].

The industrial revolution was triggered by society’s transition
from bio-energy, in the form of wood, to a fuel with larger total
availability and higher energy density (cid:1) coal [3,22]. Humankind can-
not rely upon bio-energy alone to replace fossil fuels in a low-carbon
future, especially if we are to increase the standard of living for
more of the current, and growing, global population.

1.3. Solar energy resources

The Sun provides the largest source of cheap, clean, and sustain-
able primary energy available to society. Wind, hydroelectric, and
bio-derived energy, as well as fossil fuels for that matter, are all just
secondary ways to harvest the solar flux. Earth receives around
3 £ 106 EJ of energy in a year from the Sun, which greatly exceeds
our current annual energy consumption of (cid:3) 500 EJ [35]. More solar
energy reaches the Earth in a single hour than is used by humanity
over the course of a year [35(cid:1)38].

In the future, it will clearly make economic sense to increase our
global generation of clean solar energy and avoid the intermediate
steps associated with biofuels, due to the higher efficiencies and
power densities of solar power generation, especially in large-scale
installations that can benefit from economies of scale [3,39]. Multi-
ple plans have been proposed that could allow all of our primary
energy needs to be supplied by clean renewable energy [40(cid:1)42],
with solar energy production in the Sun Belt and wind power in
windy locations the largest and cheapest of the available resources
[41(cid:1)45]. Estimates show that current solar photovoltaic panels can
provide the entire U.S. energy needs using around 1% of the total
land area [42]. This is less land than is currently used for corn etha-
nol production [44,46], at questionable energetic and environmental
value [6,47,48]. The cost of clean-power systems are continually fall-
ing [39], and parity with fossil-fuelled systems is already achieved in
some places. The transition to low-carbon primary power generation
can be further incentivized by prices on carbon dioxide emissions
and other pollutants.

1.4. Advanced nuclear

Another option for zero-carbon energy is nuclear power genera-
tion [49]. Advanced nuclear technologies, including those based on
thorium cycles [50] or breed-and-burn reactors that can handle both
thorium and spent nuclear fuel from early-generation nuclear power
plants [50,51], also promise to reduce the current nuclear-waste
concerns of the more common reactors used today [50]. Thermonu-
clear fusion has long promised to provide cheap and clean power
[52,53] but remains elusive, with current goals for electrical power
generation, using the successor to the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER), by 2050 [54].

2. Need for energy storage and tradeable energy commodities

A wide range of clean, low-carbon power-generation technolo-
gies are available and the transition to a low-carbon power grid
appears feasible, even if the scope is daunting [55]. The power out-
put of many clean power sources, such as solar and wind, are highly
variable in time, over diurnal to seasonal timescales. Fossil fuels
allow energy to be stockpiled to protect against supply disruptions,
such as the U.S. petroleum reserve; these reserves can then be drawn
down when needed to either meet peak demand or compensate for
unavailability of primary-energy supplies. Some regions may not be
able to produce sufficient low-carbon energy locally, due to their
high population density or geographic conditions, and will need
to import clean energy from afar [56]. In addition to their use as
fuels for transportation and power generation, fossil fuels enable
the global trade of energy and play a key role in our global economy.
To address this wide range of energy demands, society requires
abundant, carbon-free, globally-tradable sustainable energy commod-
ities which:

(cid:4) provide the high energy densities and convenience of fossil

fuels,

(cid:4) can be created using low-carbon primary-energy sources,
(cid:4) can be safely exported over long distances,
(cid:4) can be safely stored indefinitely with minimal loss,
(cid:4) can be used for transportation and stationary power generation

at various power levels,

(cid:4) are available in large quantities, and
(cid:4) are recyclable [57].

The currently-traded high-carbon energy commodities are coal,
oil and natural gas, which are moved throughout the globe using
tanker ships, oil and gas pipelines, railway networks, and trucks
with minimal losses during transport and storage. Any sustainable

172

J.M. Bergthorson / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 169(cid:1)196

energy commodity that replaces fossil-derived hydrocarbon fuels
must have similar energy density, safety, and transportability to
meet societies’ energy needs.

2.1. Electricity and mechanical-energy storage

The availability of clean power sources is limited by latitude,
geography and weather patterns, as well as land availability per cap-
ita [56], in addition to nuclear policy and technical and economic
capabilities. Increased grid interconnectivity can enable trade in
clean electricity across larger distances. While connection of spa-
tially-distant locations can help to mitigate the fluctuations inherent
in many clean energy systems [45], the electricity-distribution infra-
structure is costly, difficult to re-route should supply and demand
shift, and results in high losses for long-distance transmission [57].

Electricity is also difficult to store. While there has been consider-
able development in larger-scale clean and efficient power-storage
systems, such as flywheel, pumped-hydroelectric, and compressed-
air storage [58,59], any technologies that store mechanical energy,
such as kinetic, potential, or flow (pressure) energy, will provide low
power and energy densities [60]. These mature technologies also
require specific geography for cost-effective deployment.

2.2. Cryogens and thermal-energy storage

Cryogens have also been considered as possible zero-carbon sec-
ondary energy carriers for some years [61(cid:1)64]. In this approach, pri-
mary energy is used to compress and liquefy a gas, typically liquid
nitrogen or liquefied air, which can act as a secondary (“negative”)
thermal energy carrier, including the latent heat of vaporization
[63]. The temperature difference between the atmosphere and the
cryogen is used to drive a heat engine. The poor energy density of
cryogens, approximately 0.17 kW ¢ h/L or 0.21 kW ¢ h/kg [62,63], is
far below those of chemical fuels due to the poorer specific energy
of thermal or physical energy sources compared to chemical energy
(c.f. Fig. 3). These same limitations preclude the use of thermal
energy-storage materials, such as molten salts [65], for anything
other than local and short-term applications.

2.3. Need for chemical energy carriers

It is a simple exercise in thermodynamics to prove that these, and
other, various forms of mechanical and thermal energy have much
lower energy storage capacity, per unit mass or volume, than chemi-
cal fuels that can be burned with air. A given mass of hydrocarbon
fuel contains the chemical energy equivalent to its gravitational
potential energy at a height of more than 4 600 km, its flow energy
at a pressure greater than 300 000 atm, or its kinetic energy at a
speed around 9.5 km/s, or Mach 28. The same chemical energy is
equivalent to heating an equal mass of ice (water) from absolute
zero to steam at a temperature near 14 000 K, neglecting chemical
dissociation. While nuclear energy is orders of magnitude more
energy dense than chemical energy, it is not easy or safe to transport,
handle, store, or use. Chemical energy carriers are needed for long-
distance energy trade, remote power generation, and heavy-duty
machinery and transportation equipment.

2.4. Chemical-energy storage in batteries

For the transportation sector, some carbon reduction can be
achieved by moving away from hydrocarbon fuel sources towards
electric, or plug-in hybrid electric, vehicles [3,66,67], enabled by
recent advances in battery technology [66,68]. Increased electrifica-
tion of vehicles, whether purely-electric or hybrid-electric systems,
enables improved efficiency of the powertrain because of the follow-
ing key benefits: (i) regenerative braking enables some of the

vehicle’s kinetic energy to be recuperated during stopping for later
use, (ii) engine idle is eliminated, and (iii) the engine, if present, can
be operated at its optimum-efficiency set point [20,69].

Traditional rechargeable secondary batteries have specific ener-
gies and energy densities on the order of 0.1(cid:1)0.2 kW ¢ h/kg and
0.2(cid:1)0.5 kW ¢ h/L [70(cid:1)72], much lower than those for fossil fuels (c.f.
Fig. 3). Purely-electric vehicles suffer from range limitations and
long recharging times that limit their market penetration [60,73,74].
The range is directly proportional to the size of the battery pack and
efficiency of the powertrain. The charging times can vary from about
9 to 30 km of driving range per hour of charging for standard charg-
ers, to around 30 min for a full vehicle charge using a high-power
fast-charge station [67,75]. It is also clear that batteries alone cannot
be used to power larger equipment, such as trucks, locomotives,
heavy machinery, military vehicles, and ships, where the low
power/energy densities of batteries cannot meet the power and
range demands of these systems [60,71].

There are even questions as to whether the overall life-cycle foot-
print of batteries is superior to fossil-fuelled internal-combustion
powertrains [68,76,77]. Part of the life-cycle problem for batteries is
the fact that they have high embodied energies and must be replaced
after several thousand cycles [78(cid:1)80], leading to waste and sustain-
ability concerns. Battery recycling, specifically of the lithium-ion
batteries being deployed in battery electric vehicles today, is cur-
rently very immature [51,80,81], with lithium not considered
valuable enough to recycle at present [80,81].

In order for electric vehicles to be a low-carbon option, the pri-
mary electricity must be produced from a low-carbon source, such
as solar, wind, or advanced nuclear energy. For countries or regions
with insufficient renewable or nuclear energy resources, additional
clean energy must be imported to replace current imports of fossil
fuels. While convenient for many important applications, batteries
simply have too low of an energy density to be considered useful for
long-distance energy trade.

2.5. Solar fuels and electrofuels

High energy and power densities can only be provided through
chemical or nuclear sources, with chemical energy, in the form of
fuels burning with atmospheric air, being the most reliable for soci-
ety to date. Alternative fuels or energy carriers derived from clean
renewable thermal and electrical energy from solar installations are
known as solar fuels [38,39,82(cid:1)84], or electrofuels [85,86]. A fuel can
be defined as a reduced material, containing chemical energy
through its oxidation potential, that can be burned or oxidized, usu-
ally with oxygen from the air, to yield useful energy on demand [83].
A solar fuel is produced with solar energy as the dominant input,
while electrofuels are produced primarily from electricity, during
the reduction process to convert spent combustion/oxidation prod-
ucts back into reactive fuel. In this article, the term electrofuel will be
used to represent all low-carbon recyclable and sustainable fuels.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of a generic electrofuel cycle. If electro-
fuels are produced using clean renewable energy, or even nuclear
energy, they can have low net carbon-dioxide emissions. For the
electrofuel to be sustainable, the product of fuel combustion, or oxi-
dation, must be recycled back into the fuel with minimal loss to the
environment, thereby avoiding pollution and waste, consistent with
the principles of a circular economy [87(cid:1)89], as shown in Fig. 1.

Using oxygen from the atmosphere as the oxidizer will always
lead to higher specific energies than for systems that must carry an
oxidizer with them on board, such as traditional batteries [90,91].
This is one reason, of many, why air-breathing (gas-turbine) engines
are preferred over rockets for aircraft propulsion. Combustion pro-
vides the high reaction rates that lead to the high power densities of
current fossil-fuelled internal-combustion engines [90,91]. Society
therefore requires high-specific-energy [J/kg or kW ¢ h/kg] and high-

Fig. 1. Schematic of the reduction-oxidation cycle characteristic of all recyclable electrofuels. Recyclable fuels are produced using clean primary energy/electricity to reduce the
fuel from its oxidized form. These chemical fuels can be stored and transported before being oxidized to produce secondary energy and power on demand. If hydrogen (H2)
is used as a fuel, the product is water (H2O), while for hydrocarbon fuels (CxHy), the products are water and carbon dioxide (CO2). For metal fuels, the fuel is a metal (M) and the
product is a metal oxide (MxOy), e.g., F=Al and FxOy=Al2O3 for aluminum.

energy-density [J/L or kW ¢ h/L] recyclable zero-carbon electrofuels,
along with associated high-specific-power [kW/kg] and high-power-
density [kW/L] engine systems, to provide clean energy at high
power levels when needed for transportation and freight vehicles.
Solar power collected in the Sun Belt near the equator could also be
stored as chemical energy in an electrofuel that is then transported
by ship, railway, and truck to be burned in stationary power plants
where and when needed, exactly as biomass or coal and other fossil
fuels are used today. These electrofuels could act as sustainable
energy commodities that can enable the worldwide trade of clean
energy and drive the global low-carbon economy.

2.5.1. Economics of electrofuels

Electrofuels, such as hydrogen generated from water through
electrolysis, suffer from serious economic challenges today. This is
because, currently, our society uses fossil fuels for producing both
electrical and motive power. As a result, the cost of electricity per
unit energy must be higher, due to efficiency losses, than the cost of
the fuels burned to produce it. Since any fuel produced from electric-
ity will be, by necessity, more expensive per unit of energy than the
electricity used to produce it, such electrofuels cannot compete at
present with fossil fuels on a cost basis. As the costs of renewable
power generation continue to decrease relative to the costs of fossil
fuels, the economics of fuels compared to electricity will invert and
electrofuels will become economically feasible. Today, hydrogen and
synthetic hydrocarbon fuels are the most widely discussed electro-
fuel options.

2.6. Hydrogen as an electrofuel

Hydrogen has long been considered the ideal electrofuel that will
replace hydrocarbon fuels in transportation and power generation,
through a transformation from the current fossil-fuel economy to
the hydrogen economy [3,40,44,82,83,92,93]. The key idea of a zero-
carbon hydrogen economy is that clean primary electricity is used to
electrolyze (reduce) water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen
(O2), which are separated following the reduction reaction. Hydro-
gen is then transported and stored until it is burned with air in an
engine, or oxidized by air within a fuel cell, back into water. The nat-
ural hydrological cycle recycles the water emitted to the atmo-
sphere, enabling the electrofuel loop to be closed (see Fig. 1).

Hydrogen is an attractive electrofuel since it has a high specific
energy and is clean burning, releasing only water as a combustion
product if it is reacted at low temperatures to avoid NOx formation
[91,94,95]. Since the fuel contains no carbon, the carbon footprint of
the hydrogen energy-carrier cycle is completely determined by that
of the primary energy source used to produce the hydrogen. Variants
of this basic idea that employ solar or nuclear thermal energy and

electricity, or use metal reduction and oxidation cycles, or redox
cycles, to lower the reaction temperatures, have been widely
explored [39,82,92]. Artificial leaves, which enable water-splitting
reactions that mimic aspects of photosynthesis, promise to produce
hydrogen cheaply [37,96,97], albeit at low power densities per unit
cell area.

2.6.1. Energy-cycle efficiency of hydrogen systems

Various life-cycle analyses have looked at the hydrogen fuel-
cycle efficiencies, with values of around 10(cid:1)30% typical for low-car-
bon options based on water
splitting through electrolysis
[38,60,98(cid:1)100]. When transported and stored in elemental form,
the compression and liquefaction of hydrogen result in severe
energy costs, where up to 40% of the energy content of hydrogen
must be expended to liquefy it [93,101], and there are parasitic
losses due to hydrogen boil off from the cryogenic tanks that prevent
efficient long-term storage and reduce the overall energy-cycle effi-
ciency [40,98,99,101].

2.6.2. Problems with hydrogen storage and safety

In addition to the economic constraints discussed above, the
hydrogen economy remains elusive due to the extremely low den-
sity of hydrogen, difficulty in its long-term storage, and its associ-
ated safety issues. The mass and volumetric energy densities of
hydrogen are compared to batteries, gasoline, and other recyclable
fuel options in Fig. 3. While the mass energy density of elemental
hydrogen is extremely high, it has a very low volumetric energy den-
sity, even as a cryogenic liquid, and, moreover, the pressure tanks
and other containment infrastructure required to store hydrogen
lead to poor overall mass energy densities of the total system
[93,101,102]. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 by also including the U.
S. Department of Energy’s hydrogen storage target of 7.5 weight-%
H2, which corresponds to a specific energy of the hydrogen-storage
system of only 2.5 kW ¢ h/kg.

The energy density of metal-hydride storage systems is compa-
rable to Li-ion batteries since approximately 50(cid:1)100 kg of hydrides
are required to store 1 kg of hydrogen [98,101(cid:1)104]. One problem
with metal-hydride storage methods is that stable storage requires
strong chemical bonds between the hydrogen and metal, which
results in a requirement to significantly heat these systems, to
temperatures above 300 °C,
in order to release the hydrogen
[93,102,104]. Increased stability and, therefore, safety of a chosen
hydride leads to necessarily slower hydrogen-release kinetics and
lower power densities, as well as lower overall efficiency, since
more energy is required to release the hydrogen from its relatively
stronger bond with the metal matrix. If hydrogen is stored in car-
bon nanotubes [101,105], the carbon acts as an inert carrier of
hydrogen, which inevitably leads to lower specific energies than

174

J.M. Bergthorson / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 169(cid:1)196

hydrocarbon fuels, which also use carbon to densify hydrogen but
burn the carbon within the fuel to carbon dioxide, releasing addi-
tional energy.

Chemical storage of hydrogen within hydrogen-rich compounds,
such as ammonia, ammonia-borane, or hydrazine [74,93,101,104],
has been investigated. Ammonia has potential problems in the form
of its toxicity, smell, and vapour explosion safety risks [74]. Ammo-
nia-borane or hydrazine are also dangerous propellants and explo-
sives [104], with associated safety risks, while hydrazine is toxic.
Even on its own, hydrogen is also the most reactive, ignitable, flam-
mable, and explosive fuel considered for widespread use, which rep-
resents significant safety concerns [93,102,106,107] in the event of
accidents or intentional attack of hydrogen-storage facilities.

No current hydrogen-storage technology can meet the U.S.
Department of Energy’s hydrogen-storage target and meet society’s
safety needs [101,102,108]. The fundamental reason why hydrogen
storage systems cannot perform better is that, in order to increase
the density of hydrogen and reduce its associated safety hazards,
metals or other materials are bonded to hydrogen, or encase it, and
these materials are chemically inert. To achieve high energy and
power densities, all such dead weight must be shed. For these various
reasons, pure hydrogen or the available chemical hydrogen carriers
fail to meet many of the key needs of a safe zero-carbon electrofuel
[74,98,106], motivating a search for alternative solutions.

2.7. Synthetic hydrocarbon solar fuels and electrofuels

Nature has demonstrated that an efficient way to store the chem-
ical energy in hydrogen is to bond it with carbon in the form of
organic hydrocarbons. More recently, it has been proposed to directly
synthesize hydrocarbon fuels (CxHy) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and
water (H2O), or hydrogen (H2), using clean primary electricity or
solar heat to create a synthetic hydrocarbon liquid fuel that is com-
patible with our current transportation fleet [30,38,39,74,83,84,109].
The basic concept is similar to biofuels, where CO2 is recycled after
emission to the atmosphere, following combustion in an engine,
through a process that mimics photosynthesis. Estimates of potential
future solar-to-fuel energy efficiencies are on the order of 10(cid:1)30%
[39], but current efficiencies are far below this [38,84]. The collection
and conversion of atmospheric CO2 is inefficient and energy intensive
because of the low CO2 concentration within the atmosphere
( (cid:3) 400 ppm) [30,38,84]. The carbon contained in three million liters
of atmosphere must be extracted in order to produce one liter of
hydrocarbon fuel, at a significant energy penalty. Vacuuming the
entire atmosphere of carbon dioxide is a tall order.

Solar hydrocarbon fuels can more easily be produced if pure or
high-concentration CO2 exhaust streams from coal or natural gas
power systems are used as the carbon feedstock [109], but the com-
bustion of the resulting synthetic hydrocarbon fuels will then emit
the CO2 from the original fossil fuels to the atmosphere, and the life-
cycle energy efficiency and emissions can actually be worse than
either biofuels or fossil fuels [84]. Similar challenges face algae

farming as a method of biofuels production, where introduction of
flue gases are often required to make the algae farm economically
feasible [30]. Either thermal fuel synthesis or biological (algae) fuel
synthesis, based on converting CO2 from flue gases to organic hydro-
carbon fuels, cannot yield significant carbon emission reductions on
an overall life-cycle basis due to the carbon footprint of the initial
fossil fuels required as a carbon feedstock. Solar hydrocarbon fuels
will also produce the same atmospheric air pollutants as fossil fuels,
including carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, particulate
matter (soot), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) [20]. The problem of hydro-
carbon fuels is that the product, carbon dioxide (CO2), is a gas under
standard conditions which makes it difficult to close the loop shown
in Fig. 1.

With the industrial revolution, society transitioned from using
organic “power systems,” including humans and domesticated ani-
mals, to using inorganic heat engines in order to amplify our individ-
ual energy use and increase our quality of life. It is interesting to note
that the organic hydrocarbon fuels that we feed our engines today
are not much different in chemical composition from the organic
food that fuels us and animals. What are the inorganic electrofuel
options?

3. Metals as zero-carbon, recyclable electrofuels

In the search for alternative electrofuels, the periodic table of the
elements provides all available options. Fig. 2 shows a subset of the
periodic table of interest for use as electrofuels. Since the fuel must
be oxidized by oxygen from the air, only groups 1(cid:1)14 are of interest.
In addition, it is desired that the fuel have high specific energy,
which means minimizing the nuclear mass for a given number of
valence electrons; therefore, only elements within periods 1(cid:1)4 are
practical. Hydrogen and carbon sit at the upper left and right of this
subset of the periodic table and are important fuel options, due to
their chemical and physical properties that result from their valence
numbers and nuclear mass. The other possible fuel elements are all
metals or metalloids and are all referred to as metals for convenience
in the rest of this review.

A largely-overlooked energy-carrier option is the use of metals as
recyclable electrofuels, which can be reacted, or burned, with both
water or air as oxidizers [57,60,73,90,91,106,110(cid:1)122]. Fig. 3 shows
the energy density and specific energy of various metal-fuel options
against the fossil and other low-carbon options. Metals, among all
elements, have the highest volumetric heat production when burned
in air and, hence, are the most energetically-dense chemical fuels
available [73]. Some metals (metalloids), such as boron, show spe-
cific energies higher than all current options, when the mass of the
necessary hydrogen-storage system is taken into account.

3.1. Metals as fuel additives in propellants and energetic materials

The high energy density of metals motivates their use as fuels
within metallized solid rocket propellants [123(cid:1)127], fireworks and

Fig. 2. Subset of the periodic table highlighting elements that are useful as electrofuels. Groups 15(cid:1)18 are faded out as these elements cannot be reacted with atmospheric oxygen
for energy purposes. Hydrogen and carbon sit at the top of this subset, and the remaining elements are all metals or metalloids. Metals that are likely too expensive for use as fuels
are colored gold, and those that are toxic, or whose oxides are toxic, are colored yellow. Interesting potential metal fuels include lithium (Li), boron (B), magnesium (Mg), alumi-
num (Al), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

ces [158]; in this case, the resulting metal anode would be a low-car-
bon electrofuel.

Metal-air batteries are effectively a type of fuel cell where a
metal fuel is electro-chemically oxidized by oxygen from the air
[158,163]. Aluminum-air batteries can achieve specific energies
of 0.3 kW ¢ h/kg and electrical efficiencies of 45% [60]. This spe-
cific energy is significantly lower than the specific energy of
pure aluminum metal (c.f. Fig. 3). The low reaction rates within
these batteries, resulting from the low temperatures of the reac-
tion, low surface area of the anode material, and the bulky oxy-
gen-reduction catalyst, lead to low power densities [60,71,158].
Metal-air batteries have been deemed impractical
for vehicle
applications unless the reaction rates can be increased by two
orders of magnitude [71].

Another serious problem for many metal-air batteries is that par-
asitic reactions of the metal anodes with water leads to a require-
ment that ultra-pure metals be used for the anode material, which
increases costs and reduces the energy-cycle efficiency [60,117].
These same corrosion reactions are exploited when metal fuels are
reacted or burned with water [164,165], as discussed in Section 5.

3.3. Metals as recyclable electrofuels

The high energy density inherent to reactive metals, which moti-
vates their use as additives to propellants and energetic materials, or
as anodes within batteries, also inspires their use as recyclable elec-
trofuels. The concept of a metal-fuel cycle, in which metals are uti-
lized as recyclable zero-carbon electrofuels is illustrated in Fig. 4. In
this concept, metals, typically as powders or sprays, are burned with
air to produce heat for a heat engine [90,120], or are reacted with
water to produce heat and hydrogen that can be used in heat engines
or fuel cells [60,91]. Metal fuels can enable the high power density of
heat engines to be achieved without producing carbon dioxide or
other pollutant emissions [90,91]. Metal fuels can be refilled, and
products emptied, rapidly, as we are accustomed to with hydrocar-
bon fuels. Metal fuels can be thought of as primary-battery anodes
that carry no dead weight [90], and the metal engine is to the metal-
air battery what the hydrogen engine is to the hydrogen fuel cell.

The key limitation to hydrocarbon electrofuels is the inefficiency
in, and energy intensity of, the carbon-recycling process [38], mak-
ing it difficult to close the fuel cycle (see Fig. 1). This difficulty arises
because carbon dioxide is a gas under standard conditions. Recycla-
ble electrofuels are required for sustainability. A fuel that produces a
solid-phase combustion product that could be captured for recycling
would likely provide a better life-cycle efficiency than solutions that
use the atmosphere as both a sink, and source, of carbon.

Metal fuels produce metal oxides, which are typically solids
under standard conditions and can be collected for recycling. Metal
fuels can be recycled from the metal-oxide products, using clean pri-
mary energy sources and existing or advanced metal-reduction tech-
niques [57,73,106,122,166], an effectively infinite number of times

carbons, hydrogen, and batteries. Adapted from [90,91].

pyrotechnics [128], liquid-hydrocarbon/metal-powder slurry fuels
[129(cid:1)132], explosives [133,134], and other energetic materials
[135,136]. Metals are also used as fuels within metal-water propel-
lants [137(cid:1)142], air-breathing ramjet engines [143(cid:1)145], and
water-breathing propulsion systems for torpedoes and underwater
vehicles [146(cid:1)157], with only part of this work reflected in the open
literature.

3.2. Metals as fuels within batteries

The high energy density of metals, along with their ability to take
part in reduction/oxidation (redox) reactions, also motivates their
use as the “fuel” within many batteries. Secondary batteries, such as
Li-ion, are attractive for low power applications, such as cell phones
and laptop computers, because they are conveniently recharged and
have high round-trip charge/discharge efficiencies [71]. Unfortu-
nately, secondary batteries have low energy density due to the need
to carry all reactants onboard, like a rocket. The low energy density
means that current secondary batteries are not practical for high-
power and long-duration applications [71,158]. The low energy den-
sity and specific energy of Li-ion batteries compared to pure lithium
metal is evident in Fig. 3.

Metal-air batteries aim to improve energy density by using the
oxygen within the air as a freely available oxidizer [60,158(cid:1)162],
similar to all air-breathing engines [71]. Metal-air batteries are typi-
cally primary batteries that must be “mechanically recharged”, or
refuelled, where the spent anode, once discharged, must be replaced
with a fresh one, while the oxidized spent anode must be collected
for central recycling [71,158]. The primary energy needed to recycle
the metal anode would preferably be supplied by clean power sour-

while avoiding loss of material to the environment. Metal fuels are,
therefore, electrofuel options consistent with the concept of a circu-
lar economy (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. 1).

3.4. Metal fuel options

Out of all of the metals identified as possible energy carriers, sili-
con, aluminum, and iron are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th most abundant
elements in the Earth’s crust, respectively [73]; the most abundant
element is oxygen, typically in the form of an oxide of these metals.
Iron is, by far, the most used metal today and is a promising electro-
fuel [90]. Silicon, technically a metalloid rather than a metal, is
another potential energy carrier, since it can be produced from sand
(SiO2), water, and solar energy [57,73,106]. Aluminum [60,91] and
magnesium [111,167] are also very interesting as metal fuels due to
their high energy density, relatively low costs, and the potential to
recycle them with low carbon emissions. Boron [116,168] and zinc
[169] have been considered as electrofuels that can produce hydro-
gen on demand for power production. Alkali metals, such as lithium
[120] and sodium [170], have also been considered as recyclable
energy carriers. Other metals, such as titanium, could also be of
interest for specific applications [122].

3.5. Recycling of the metal-oxide products

Metal fuels produce solid metal-oxide combustion products that
can be separated from the combustion/reaction products and then
be stored for later recycling, commonly termed smelting. Many cur-
rent metal production and recycling technologies rely heavily on fos-
sil energy inputs. For example, iron is primarily reduced using coke,
a high-carbon distillate of coal [122,171]. Aluminum is produced
using the Hall(cid:1)H(cid:1)eroult process, which can make use of clean pri-
mary energy but also requires the use of consumable carbon anodes
to reduce the metal, resulting in the production of stoichiometric
amounts of carbon dioxide [172]. Metal oxides can, however, be
reduced using clean primary energy sources in zero-carbon reduc-
tion processes, which is essential for metals to be useful as zero-car-
bon recyclable electrofuels [122].

3.5.1. MAGIC Cycle

A zero-carbon electrofuel cycle has been proposed called the
magnesium-injection cycle (MAGIC) [111,167]. The MAGIC cycle is
based on reacting magnesium fuels with water to produce hydrogen
and steam that can drive a turbine; the resulting magnesium oxide
reaction products are collected and recycled to reactive metal fuels
using a solar-powered laser to create high local temperatures to
drive the reduction process [111,167]. Solar lasers [173,174], or plas-
mas [166,175], focus the Sun’s power locally in time and space to
enable the reduction process without having to sustain constant
temperatures in excess of 4000 K, as would be needed, for example,
in a concentrated-solar reducing furnace [110,176]. The life-cycle
energy-storage efficiency of these proposed metal reduction tech-
nologies remains to be demonstrated.

3.5.2. Open-loop chemical looping

Metal fuels produced within chemical-looping combustion or
solar/nuclear redox systems could be used in distributed power gen-
eration applications and, thereby, act as chemical energy carriers
[90,114]. Chemical looping combustion uses a metal-oxide/metal
redox reaction to enable oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels without
diluting the combustion products with nitrogen from atmospheric
air [114,177]. The reduction reactor reduces metal oxides into reac-
tive metals while oxidizing fossil or bio-derived hydrocarbon fuels,
such as gasified coal, biomass, or municipal solid waste, to produce
an exhaust stream of undiluted water and CO2 that facilitates CO2
capture and sequestration [177(cid:1)179]. After being reduced by the

hydrocarbon fuels, the metals are then oxidized with air in a second
reactor, producing heat to generate power and regenerating the
metal oxides that can be used as an oxidizer for the hydrocarbon
fuels, closing the loop.

Instead of running the two stages of the chemical-looping reactor
directly in sequence, the loop can be opened. The reactive metal
fuels, produced via reaction of the metal oxides with fossil or bio-
mass fuels, can be redirected for use as metal fuels in distributed
power systems [90,114,120,180]. The centrally-produced carbon
dioxide could be sequestered and the metal fuels produce no CO2
emissions at point of use, so there would be no net carbon emissions
from metal fuels derived from fossil resources employing carbon
sequestration. Metal fuels could also act as a carbon-negative energy
vector [30] if biomass is used as the primary energy source within a
carbon-sequestration system. In such a fuel cycle, CO2 absorbed
from the atmosphere during plant growth is sequestered, leading to
a net reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

3.5.3. Reduction of iron with hydrogen

Iron oxide can be reduced to iron directly by hydrogen, as in the
steam-iron redox process [114,181], the Midrex process [182], or
the suspension ironmaking process [171], enabling zero-carbon
metal-fuel production using industrial-scale technologies that are
commercially available. This would enable the energy in clean
hydrogen, produced using electrolysis or even artificial
leaves
[96,97], to be stored as iron fuel, rather than needing to store com-
pressed or cryogenic hydrogen.

3.5.4. Metal production using electrolysis

Rather than going through such multi-step processes for reduc-
ing metals, direct production of metals using clean energy is possible
through electrolysis reactions, commonly termed electrowinning,
similar to those used to electrolyze water into hydrogen [122]. Direct
electrolysis of metals, including iron [186,187], aluminum [172,188],
and silicon [189(cid:1)191], has been demonstrated at the laboratory
scale without any intrinsic carbon dioxide emissions [183]. Fig. 5a
shows a range of options for reducing iron oxide into iron that utilize
carbon, hydrogen, or electricity as the energetic inputs [183,184],
while Fig. 5b shows a schematic of a zero-carbon iron electrolysis
cell [185]. Electrolysis can lead to energy-storage efficiencies in the
metal fuels above 80% [172,186,192,193]. Additionally, electrolysis
of metals in low-melting-point salts, termed ionic liquids, promises
to produce metals with zero carbon emissions at high energy effi-
ciency [194]. These techniques are not common today due to the
low cost of fossil energy resources and the long history, since the
dawn of the iron age, of using carbon to reduce metals. A transition
to a low-carbon society must involve the elimination of fossil fuels
from all metallurgical processes, as the production of metals is a
major source of global carbon dioxide emissions [193,195].

Using concentrated low-quality solar thermal energy for the bulk
of the energy demand, supplemented with a reduced amount of
high-quality electricity, can also lead to efficient production of metal
fuels with ultra-low carbon footprints [110]. Use of recycled pow-
ders greatly reduces the life-cycle energy inputs [196].

Various low-carbon metal smelting technologies need to be fur-
ther developed, scaled up, and deployed commercially to enable a
low-carbon economy, independently of the metal-fuel concept. In
fact, a strength of the metal-fuel concept is the ability to leverage
the existing infrastructure for metal production, storage, and trans-
port, which can be retro-fitted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,
rather than requiring a whole new infrastructure to be built up.

3.6. Energy-cycle efficiency of metal fuels

Not many life-cycle, or energy-cycle efficiency, analyses are
available to assess the use of metals as energy vectors, but

energetic inputs to the reduction reaction. Note that the pathways along the base of the triangle can be performed without any intrinsic CO2 emissions. Reprinted from [183],
based on [184], with permission of The Electrochemical Society. b) Schematic of a low-temperature alkaline electrolysis cell for the production of iron from iron oxide with the
production of only oxygen gas as a byproduct, commonly termed electrowinning. Redrawn following [185].

estimates of the thermal efficiency of aluminum utilization as an
energy carrier of 43% are reported, while the round-trip electrical
energy-cycle efficiency is around 20(cid:1)30% [57,60]. Lower energy-
cycle efficiencies are found for nanoparticles [115], as well as for
boron-based cycles [116]. The estimated energy-cycle efficiencies
are similar to that for hydrogen as an energy carrier, while use
of metal fuels solves the difficulties associated with hydrogen,
including: low power and energy density, finite storage life (as
cryogenic liquid), and serious safety concerns during accidental
release or intentional attack. The energy-cycle efficiencies are
also similar to those that would be achieved with high power
batteries, since fast charging and discharging of batteries leads
to increased loss due to the internal resistance of the battery
[71]. The operating cost of a metal fuel should be cheaper than
the cost of a battery based off of that same material due to the
minimal processing of the metal fuel and ability to recycle the
material over and over.

If high-efficiency electrolysis (80%) is used to produce the metals
and high-efficiency power systems ( (cid:3) 50%) are used to convert the
chemical energy of the fuel into on-demand power, it is possible to
achieve energy-carrier cycles that have efficiencies around 40%,
which is basically as high as possible due to thermodynamic consid-
erations. Loss of some clean primary energy is a price to be paid for
dense energy storage and transport. All current fossil-fuelled power
systems yield similar efficiencies (9 60%) for conversion of chemical
to useful energy, such that a key question is which recyclable elec-
trofuel can be produced, transported, and stored with the highest
overall efficiency.

This review argues that metal fuels are the most-promising
zero-carbon energy carriers proposed to date, such that more
studies on the energy-cycle efficiency and life-cycle emissions of
different metal fuels are warranted, as are economic analyses of
these novel fuel cycles. Advanced recycling processes with low or
net-zero carbon footprints, and high energy efficiencies for reduc-
ing metal oxides back into metals, are a key enabler for a low-car-
bon economy using metals as both fuels and materials for
manufacturing and construction. As this topic has received rela-
tively scant attention compared to biofuels, hydrogen, or other
alternative energy carriers, more work is clearly needed to iden-
tify the optimal metals for use as energy carriers on both environ-
mental
life-cycle and economic bases. Equally important is to
identify feasible technologies that can harness the energy con-
tained within recyclable metal fuels, and the remainder of this
focus on the science and engineering knowledge
review will
needed to develop these technologies.

4. Harnessing power from recyclable metal fuels

Efficient zero-carbon power-generation systems with high
energy and power densities are needed at a range of scales to power
households, industrial facilities, remote communities, or the electri-
cal grid, as well as to drive transportation vehicles, including passen-
ger cars, trucks, heavy-duty machinery, rail locomotives, ships, and
aircraft. These power needs are, typically, met at present using inter-
nal-combustion or external-combustion engines fuelled by fossil
hydrocarbon fuels burning with atmospheric oxygen. If metal pow-
ders are to be used as recyclable zero-carbon fuels, efficient and
power-dense metal-fuelled engines or other power systems are
needed. In order to deliver high energy and power densities, metal-
fuelled systems must burn the metal fuel with atmospheric air at
high pressures and temperatures, as all modern engines do with
hydrocarbon fuels today.

Two main routes have been proposed that can efficiently harness,
at high power densities, the chemical energy contained in metal fuels:

1. Wet Cycle: reaction of metals with water at high temperatures to
produce heat and hydrogen for subsequent use in heat engines or
fuel cells, using metals such as aluminum and magnesium [91].
2. Dry Cycle: direct combustion of metals with air to fuel external-
combustion heat engines, using metals such as iron and silicon
[90].

The two cycles are shown schematically in Fig. 6, where two
routes are shown for each cycle. The Wet Cycle (metal-water reac-
tion) can employ either a low-temperature metal-water reaction, or
high-temperature metal-water combustion. Carrying water leads to
a weight penalty unless water is readily available, as in marine or
stationary applications, or water is recycled on board [91]. The Dry
Cycle (metal-air reaction) can either employ a low-temperature
electrochemical reaction within a metal-air battery, or a high-tem-
perature combustion reaction with air. Direct combustion of metals
with air naturally achieves the maximum possible energy density of
any metal-air battery, while avoiding the issues associated with
metal-air batteries discussed previously in Section 3.2.

5. Wet Cycle: metal-water reaction to produce hydrogen

The chemical balance equation for a generic high-temperature

metal-water reaction is:

xM þ yH2O ! MxOy þ yH2 þ Q1

ð1Þ

178

water at temperatures up to 200 °C. The steam-iron process has
been used to produce pure hydrogen for over a century, with the
reaction typically running above 800 °C [213]. Boron, magnesium,
and zinc hydrolysis have also shown reasonable production rates
and yields at temperatures above 400 °C [168,169,214]. Lithium
[215] and sodium [170] have been proposed as water-splitting fuels,
but there are safety hazards associated with transport and storage of
alkali metals [216(cid:1)218].

5.1. Low-temperature aluminum-water reactions

Most of the existing studies on the metal-water reaction have
been focused on developing a convenient hydrogen source by react-
ing aluminum with water near room temperature. The mechanism
of aluminum oxidation by water is thought to follow these stages
[119,219(cid:1)229]:

1. Hydration of the aluminum oxide coating into a hydroxide gel,
in which hydroxide ions are diffusing through, and hydrating,
the oxide coating;

2. Reaction of the hydroxide with the unreacted aluminum core
to generate hydrogen and aluminum oxide, which is then
hydrated;

3. Quenching of the reaction at some point due to impermeability
of the oxide/hydroxide shell, or bridging of the hydroxide
between particles, which limits the total hydrogen yield from
the reaction.

The three stages are shown schematically in Fig. 8, along with a
sketch of the characteristic hydrogen production curve.

that hydrate it

It is believed that the rate-limiting step in the reaction is the
ions through the aluminum-oxide layer
diffusion of hydroxyl
[219(cid:1)221,229],
into boehmite (AlOOH), or
pseudo-boehmite which is similar to boehmite but contains
excess water [219(cid:1)221,224,225,230,231]. The rate of hydration
increases with temperature according to Arrhenius kinetic laws
[219,221,224,225,230,231]. Since it is a surface reaction, the
reaction rate scales with particle surface area, such that smaller
particle sizes have higher production rates per unit mass [227].
The hydrogen production from micron-sized, or larger, particles
is very low at normal temperatures due to the protective oxide
coating that prevents further oxidation [227].

5.2. Increasing the rate of low temperature metal-water reactions

To improve the reactivity of aluminum with water at low to mod-
erate temperatures, below 100 °C, many different approaches have
been tested. These approaches attempt to disrupt the formation of
the protective oxide layer, to increase the hydrogen yield, and typi-
cally employ small metal-particle sizes to increase the surface-to-
volume ratio and, hence, the reaction rates.

5.2.1. Use of alkaline solutions or direct metal-water contact

Metal powders have been reacted with alkaline solutions to
produce hydrogen for more than a century [232], with studies con-
tinuing today [165,201,233(cid:1)236]. Other groups have investigated
the exposure of fresh metal to water through cutting/machining
[204,237] or using molten metal [209]. Ball-milling powders can
increase their specific surface area and increase the reaction yield
[228,238], but with an associated energy cost.

5.2.2. Nanoparticles

The use of small particles of average size from tens to hundreds of
nanometers, or nanoparticles, increases the specific surface area and
leads to increased reaction rates [119,239(cid:1)241], as well as improved

Fig. 6. Schematic diagram of the metal fuel concept showing the different routes for
power generation from metal fuels. The metal-water reaction (Wet Cycle) can be
operated in a reactor or combustion mode, generating heat and hydrogen as inter-
mediates that can be burned in a variety of engines or fuel cells. The metal-air reaction
(Dry Cycle) can be operated as an electrochemical reaction in a metal-air battery or
through high-temperature metal-air combustion to drive a heat engine. In each case,
clean primary energy is stored for delivery in a metal fuel, which is then consumed on
demand to produce clean secondary energy at the point of use. The metal oxides pro-
duced are recycled back into metal fuels (c.f. Fig. 4).

where M represents the metal fuel of interest and Q1 the heat pro-
duced by the exothermic metal-water reaction. The resulting hydro-
gen would then be reacted or burned with oxygen, from the air, in a
fuel cell or heat engine:

ð2Þ

releasing the chemical energy contained in the hydrogen, Q2, as ther-
mal energy within a heat engine, thereby producing mechanical
power, or directly as electrical energy within a fuel cell. It can be
seen that the net effect of summing Reactions 1(cid:1)2 is equivalent,
thermodynamically, to the direct combustion of the metal fuel with
oxygen:

xM þ y
2

O2 ! MxOy þ Q3

ð3Þ

where Q3 1⁄4 Q1 þ Q2 is the exothermicity of the direct metal oxida-
tion with atmospheric air [60,91]. For many metals, Q1 and Q2 are
comparable [91]. The consequence of this is that the metal-water
reaction must be operated at high temperatures, so as to produce
useful heat, or fuel cells must be used to compensate for the loss of
Q1 through a higher conversion efficiency of the hydrogen chemical
energy, Q2, to useful power. If hydroxides are formed, additional
water is needed and Q1 changes [91].

The in-situ production of hydrogen using reactions between
water and metal powders, typically aluminum, has received much
attention recently [60,91,116,117,196,198(cid:1)200], with several power
systems being discussed in the literature [164,181,201(cid:1)211] and
being patented [e.g., 212]. A recent study has investigated the reac-
tivity of a wide range of industrially available metal powders with
water for the production of hydrogen [197], with the hydrogen yield
results presented in Fig. 7. As expected from past studies, aluminum
and magnesium are the most promising metals for high mass and
volumetric energy densities. Iron, silicon and boron powders do not
show promising hydrogen production rates or yields under liquid

reaction completeness or yield [227]. As a direct negative conse-
quence of the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles, the pas-
sivating oxide layer represents a much larger fraction of the mass of
the nanoparticles, and can exceed 36% for particles below 20 nm
[130,142,242,243]. Nanoparticles also age much more rapidly when
exposed to air and water than do micron-sized particles, making
long-term storage difficult [244].

A serious safety concern associated with the use of nanoparticles
is the possibility of spontaneous ignition of the metal-water mixture
[245]. Work is ongoing to develop protective coatings for such nano-
particles, including stearic or oleic acid [244,246], fluoropolymers
[247], and carbon [119,242]. These protective coatings can improve
the safety of using nanoparticles by increasing the temperature at
which reaction or spontaneous ignition of the aluminum-water mix-
tures occurs [248], as well as increasing the active metal content and
improving the ageing properties of the particles.

Nanoparticles are much more expensive than micron-sized par-
ticles [119,249(cid:1)251] and require higher energy inputs to produce
[60,115], reducing the energy-cycle efficiency.

5.2.3. Alloys, galvanic reactions, and catalysts

Another approach to boosting the low-temperature reactivity
of water has been to alloy the aluminum with other metals to
disrupt the formation of the protective aluminum-oxide film,
such as gallium [252(cid:1)256], bismuth [257(cid:1)260], indium or mercury
[203], or lithium [261,262]. Gallium is a very expensive additive
that creates a eutectic mixture with aluminum that leads to a low
melting point, which enables complete oxidation of the aluminum
[254,256]. In some cases, these other metals act as the cathodes in
a micro-galvanic cell that accelerates corrosion (oxidation) of the
aluminum, with the aluminum acting as the anode and the ions
in the water providing the necessary conductivity [257(cid:1)259]. This
same approach has been used for more than 60 years in the ready-
to-eat meals used by the U.S. military, which uses a reaction
between magnesium and water activated by a galvanic reaction
between magnesium and iron powder, with salt added to provide
conductivity [263(cid:1)265].

In order to avoid the use of expensive or toxic metals as alloying
agents, some researchers have ball-milled aluminum particles with

salts [251,266(cid:1)268] or with metal oxides, including aluminum oxide
[199,223,269,270], aluminum hydroxide [270(cid:1)273], bismuth oxide
[274], or calcium oxide [119]. Ultrasonically-prepared suspensions
of ultra-fine aluminum hydroxide particles also enhance reaction
rates [271]. Aluminum oxide, specifically g(cid:1)Al2O3; or aluminum
hydroxides act as catalysts to facilitate water splitting and increase
the rate of hydration of the passivating aluminum-oxide layer on the
surface of the particles [270].

5.2.4. Problems with the low-temperature Wet Cycle

Each of these proposed solutions to improve the metal-water
reaction has negative consequences associated with them. Machin-
ing or melting require energy inputs that reduce the cycle efficiency,
while caustic substances increase safety risks and result in corrosion
of the equipment. Use of nanoparticles, alloying agents, ball milling,
or chemical activators leads to increased energy inputs, reduced
active metal content, and increased costs. The use of activated metal
powders also poses an ignition and explosion risk if they are exposed
to water during transport or storage.

The main engineering problem with such low-temperature
reactions is that approximately half of the energy contained in
the metal powder is lost as waste heat during the metal-water
reaction [60,91,196]. Technologies must be developed to harness
as much energy from the metal fuel as possible to achieve high
cycle efficiencies, with high-temperature aluminum-water reac-
tions followed by combustion of the resulting hydrogen-steam
mixture with air in heat engines a promising option [60,91].
If only the hydrogen is used, then the aluminum-water system

fails to meet the U.S. Department of Energy ultimate hydrogen
storage target [198,275], unless water can be recycled onboard
[91,117,196].

5.3. High-temperature reactions to increase rates and yields

Increasing the reactor temperature, which requires increased
pressures to maintain water in the liquid state, increases the reac-
tion rates exponentially through Arrhenius kinetics (see Fig. 9a,b).
Fig. 9b shows that the reaction rate per unit surface area collapses
for the three different particle sizes studied, which demonstrates
that oxidation of the aluminum occurs through a heterogeneous
surface reaction [227]. The rate-limiting reaction step is believed
to be the hydration of the passivating aluminum oxide layer
[219(cid:1)221,229]. The diffusion rate of hydroxyl ions through the
aluminum oxide coating can be represented by Fick’s law [229],
with a solid-state diffusion rate described by an Arrhenius law,
exponentially increasing with increasing temperature [276].

5.3.1. Reaction yield and penetration thickness

The hydrogen yield also shows a strong sensitivity to both the
particle size and reaction temperature (see Fig. 10a) [227]. At a given
temperature, smaller particle sizes produce higher yields while, for a
given particle size, the hydrogen yield increases sharply with
increasing temperature. The limited reaction yield at low tempera-
tures is thought to be a result of the blocking, or healing, of the
porous aluminum hydroxide layer in time, eventually stopping the

reaction before it consumes all of the metal within the particle cores
(see Fig. 8) [220,224,228,229].

This quenching process has been related to a penetration thick-
ness, which is the depth through which the reaction can propagate
into the metal particle before the reaction is quenched by the forma-
tion of an impermeable aluminum-oxide/-hydroxide film [227]. As
shown in Fig. 10b, the penetration thickness appears to collapse the
hydrogen-yield data for different particle sizes, although the cur-
rently available data is insufficient to make definitive statements. At
a given temperature, smaller particles will achieve a higher hydro-
gen yield, since the penetration thickness will be a larger fraction of
the initial particle radius, but a higher temperature can be used to
achieve the same yield from a larger-sized powder. Yields close to
100% of the theoretical maximum, based on reaction stoichiometry,
are achieved for powders with mean diameters of 6 and 14 mm, at
temperatures above 175 and 200 °C, respectively [227], while 70 mm
powder could be completely consumed within several minutes at
temperatures above 350 °C [277].

Reaction of aluminum also shows high rates under supercritical-
water conditions, although yields less than 100% are reported [278].
Hydrothermal synthesis under supercritical conditions produces
nanoparticles of a wide variety of metal oxides [279]. More research
is needed to determine the reactivity and yields of the most-promis-
ing metal powders with water at increasingly elevated temperature
conditions, requiring significant reactor pressures to maintain water
in the liquid or supercritical states. High-temperature metal-water
reactions enable use of more of the metal-fuel energy and increase
the cycle efficiency over that at low temperatures [91]. The energy-
cycle efficiency is further increased if micron-sized or coarser
particles can be used, which have a lower embodied energy than
nanoparticles [60].

5.3.2. Ultrasonic agitation to increase rates and yields

Ultrasonic agitation directly in the reactor has been demon-
strated as a non-corrosive and low-energy/low-cost option for
boosting rates and yields [119,224,227,280]. Ultrasonic agitation
aims to break up and disperse the hydroxide coating of the particle,
enabling more of the aluminum to react given the penetration thick-
ness associated with the reaction temperature. Agitation can also
suspend the particles within the water to prevent the oxide/hydrox-
ide bridging that can quench the reaction. There could also be a simi-
lar reaction-promoting mechanism occurring as when ultra-fine
aluminum-hydroxide is purposely suspended in the reaction water,
typically also via ultrasonic agitation [271].

5.4. Metal-water combustion

If higher power density is desired, then the reaction rates can be
increased by transitioning to a high-temperature combustion mode.
Metal powders can be burned with water in flames at temperatures
above 3000 K, producing extremely hot hydrogen-steam mixtures,
along with metal-oxide residues [91,137,138]. Using higher combus-
tion temperatures should also improve the overall efficiency of the
metal-fuel cycle, due to the Carnot principles [91]. The high-temper-
ature reaction of metal powders with water has previously been
explored for propulsion of underwater vehicles and as an environ-
mentally friendly rocket propellant.

5.4.1. Metal-water combustion for underwater propulsion

Metal-water reactions or combustion, using aluminum or magne-
sium fuels, have been explored for powering torpedoes or underwa-
ter vehicles [146(cid:1)149,152,155,156]. The combustion of metals with
seawater is also investigated for high-speed underwater ramjet
engines [151,153,154,157]. In such systems, the metal fuel provides
high energy density and is carried on board, while the abundantly
available seawater is used as the oxidizer, in a water-breathing

engine. A water-breathing engine takes advantage of the available
seawater and “breathes” it in, similar to how a jet engine “breathes”
in atmospheric air, and then reacts this water with a metal fuel to
produce hot hydrogen as a propellant. The use of high-temperature
reactions increases power density and enables faster vehicle speeds.
By eliminating the need to carry the oxidizer on board, a water-
breathing engine achieves a higher energy density,
increasing
vehicle range, compared to battery-based systems.

Metal-powder/water combustors have been developed and dem-
onstrated [147,149,281], along with power-generation systems, typ-
ically based on Rankine-cycle or Stirling engines [152], turbines
[147,149], or combined Rankine-cycle and fuel-cell systems [155].
These metal-water power systems have demonstrated efficiencies
on the order of 20(cid:1)30% [149,152,156].

5.4.2. Metal-water combustion for rocket propulsion

Metal-water reactions have also been explored for rocket propul-
sion, taking advantage of the fast burning rates of mixtures of micron
and sub-micron sized metal-fuel particles with water, especially at
elevated pressures, and the competitive specific impulse of metal-
water propellants compared to conventional propellants [137(cid:1)140].
The specific impulse, Isp, is a performance measure of rocket propel-
lants that represents the time during which a kilogram of propellant
can generate 9.81 N of thrust, with higher values meaning less
propellant is required for a given mission [282]. Aluminum-water
combustion produces light hydrogen gas at high temperatures
(enthalpies), which leads to a theoretical specific impulse of around
280 s [139,140], within the range of typical rocket propellants
(200(cid:1)300 s) [282], while actual specific impulse achieved will be
lower due to two-phase losses that result from the majority of the
products being solid metal oxides [140].

One problem with using nanometric aluminum is that it oxidizes
during storage if exposed to water, or even humidity. This oxidation
can be avoided if the aluminum-water mixture is frozen and stored
at temperatures around ¡30°C as an aluminum-ice (ALICE) propel-
lant [283]. A rocket propelled by ALICE was successfully demon-
strated in 2009 (see Fig. 11b) [142].

5.4.3. Metal-water combustion rates

In order to be an attractive propellant, the burning rate must be
sufficient for a high power density to be achieved, with the burning
rate typically tested by observing the propagation speed of a flame
through a strand of the propellant (see Fig. 11a). Many studies of alu-
minum-water and ALICE propellants have been performed over
the last decade, with the results summarized in Fig. 12. Generally,
the burning rates increase with decreasing particle size, and increase
with increasing reaction pressure. The pressure dependence can be
correlated using Saint Robert’s Law:

r 1⁄4 aPn
c

ð4Þ

where r is the propellant burning rate, Pc is the non-dimensional
combustion pressure, and a and n are fitting parameters. The pres-
sure exponents, n, for metal-water propellants are typically below
0.5, which represents a low pressure sensitivity that is desirable to
reduce susceptibility to acoustic instabilities [282]. The burning rates
of aluminum-water/ice propellants are comparable to, or faster than,
those for traditional propellants [125]. While the burning rates may
appear low compared to the flame speeds of typical hydrocarbon
fuels, it is important to note that the density of the aluminum-water
mixture is a thousand times higher than that of a gaseous fuel-air
mixture, such that the power density achieved during metal-water
combustion is extremely high [91].

5.4.4. Storage and handling of aluminum-water propellants

ALICE propellants are inconvenient due to the necessity of
temperature-controlled storage and handling facilities. The use

of protective coatings on the particles, such as hydrocarbons or
fluorocarbons, aims to prevent their premature oxidation or
unintentional
ignition. Recent work investigated the effect of
several types of particle coatings on the Al-water propellant
burning rate at very high pressures (up to 34.5 MPa), showing
reasonable burning rates and pressure exponents [91,287], as
seen in Fig. 12. Such protective coatings add energetic and mon-
etary costs to the metal fuel.

5.4.5. Efficiency of aluminum-water combustion

The combustion efficiency of metal-water propellants varies
between 50(cid:1)65% for stoichiometric mixtures up to 70 atm [138],
but increasing the water content, to reduce the equivalence ratio,
increases the efficiencies to values between 70(cid:1)95% [138,283,284].
Using excess water can enable complete oxidation of micron-sized
aluminum particles at pressures above 50 atm [138].

5.4.6. Hydrogen peroxide accelerates metal-water combustion

In order to boost the reaction rates and increase combustion effi-
ciency, researchers have also investigated the addition of hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) as a strong oxidizer to the water, which increases
the burning rate exponentially with H2O2 concentration [289]. The
high reactivity and potential for explosion [289] or detonation [290],
when hydrogen peroxide is used, may exclude it from practical

consideration for civilian applications. This can be tempered through
the use of micron-sized aluminum particles, which can burn with
H2O2/water mixtures at rates similar to those of nano-aluminum in
pure water [250].

5.4.7. Metal-water combustion for air-breathing propulsion

In the rocket or torpedo applications discussed above, the hot
hydrogen produced during metal-water combustion is typically
exhausted as the propellant, resulting in the waste of up to half
of the energy within the metal fuel [60,91]. Alternatively, this
hot hydrogen is an ideal fuel for combustion in a compact high-
speed air-breathing engine, such as a ramjet or scramjet, due to
its high diffusivity and reactivity [91]. An air-breathing engine,
that burns the hydrogen produced from the aluminum-water
propellant with atmospheric air, could have a specific impulse
that is doubled over the rocket mode [91], due to the fact that
Q1 and Q2 are similar for aluminum. The specific impulse
increases because more of the energy contained in the metal fuel
is harnessed when the hot hydrogen is burned with atmospheric
air. The ability to also burn the metal-water mixture directly as
a rocket propellant enables the design of a multi-stage vehicle
that launches and accelerates in a rocket mode, transitions to an
air-breathing ramjet mode after Mach 1, and then to a scramjet
for hypersonic flight [91].

5.4.8. Metal-water combustion for compact power systems

The ability to produce high-temperature hydrogen very rapidly in
metal-water combustors leads to a high power density of the hydro-
gen-production system [O(106 kW/L)], that can be more than six
orders of magnitude faster than that at temperatures below 100 °C
[91]. This is the result of the exponentially increasing rate of reac-
tions, governed by Arrhenius kinetics, with increasing temperature.
The metal-water reactor or combustor could be combined with a
variety of compact heat engines in order to produce clean power at
high power densities, as depicted in Fig. 13 [91].

5.5. Engines and fuel cells fuelled by hot hydrogen

The high-temperature and high-pressure hydrogen and steam
mixture produced by the metal-water reactor could first be passed
through a turbine to extract
the mixture thermal enthalpy
[91,204,208], and then a fuel cell could be used to extract the chemi-
cal energy from the mixture [206], at efficiencies higher than 40%
[204]. Current fuel cells have relatively low power densities due
to the low-temperature of the reactions and the need for bulky
oxygen-reduction catalysts [71].

The hot, high-pressure hydrogen produced within the metal-
water combustor could also be used within a variety of internal-
combustion engines (ICEs) [91]. ICEs have been developed for some
years that can operate with hydrogen fuel at high efficiency and that
produce ultra-low emissions [94,95]. The use of
the metal-
water ! H2 ! water reaction sequence does not involve any of the
toxic carbon-based pollutant emissions associated with hydrocarbon
fuels, such as carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, aldehydes,
ketones, or soot and soot precursors [20]. Formation of nitrogen
oxides can be minimized through the use of ultra-lean and steam-
diluted low-temperature combustion strategies [95], as done for
hydrocarbon fuels [7,20]. To avoid wear on the engines, the hydro-
gen would need to be separated from the metal-oxide products
upstream of the engine.

Another alternative to the use of hydrogen ICEs are external-
combustion heat engines (ECEs), which promise power densities on
par with ICEs and can, potentially, achieve higher efficiencies
[20,64,291(cid:1)293]. An ECE, coupled to both the metal-water combus-
tor and a heat-recirculating burner [20,294,295], that would burn
the hydrogen-steam mixture with air at high efficiencies, could lead
to a system that is very efficient in converting the heat from both
combustion stages into useful motive energy [91]. Next generation
ECEs claim electrical and mechanical conversion efficiencies above
60% [296], which can beat that of fuel cells.

Such metal-fuel systems could achieve high power and energy
densities with ultra-low emissions and would be a promising tech-
nology within a low-carbon economy. Breathing water, or recycling
it on board from the products of hydrogen combustion, can
increase the energy density and specific energy of the propulsion
system [91]. This makes the Wet Cycle specifically of interest for
marine applications or other locations where water is abundantly
available.

6. Dry Cycle: direct metal-air combustion

The intermediate step of generating hydrogen and heat before
combustion of the hydrogen with air inherently increases the system
complexity, size and weight due to the need to carry water, the
metal-water reactor, and the associated plumbing. It will also likely
lead to reduced overall energy-conversion efficiencies due to the
two thermodynamic steps employed. Direct combustion of the metal
fuel with air is desirable to maximize the efficiency, as well as the
power and energy density, of the engine system. Moreover, only
very active metals, such as aluminum and magnesium, react readily
with water while other abundant metals/metalloids, such as iron or
silicon, do not [197]. Iron can be burned in a flame mode with air
[297(cid:1)300] and other oxidizing gases [301(cid:1)304], while silicon
flames have also been observed [305]. These common metals may
be cost-effective metal fuels, and broadening the list of elements

that can be used as metal fuels would likely lower the overall life--
cycle environmental impacts and economic costs of a future zero-
carbon energy system based, in part, on metal fuels.

6.1. Metal-particle combustion in internal-combustion engines

The combustion of metal powders with air in internal-combus-
tion engines (ICEs) has been proposed [73,113,118,121], as illus-
trated in Fig. 14 [306]. Combustion of the metal fuels in air allows all
of the chemical energy to be released as heat, which could increase
the utilization efficiency to that of the most-efficient heat engines
available.

Unfortunately,

the long combustion times associated with
micron-sized particles could result in incomplete combustion, and
an associated loss in fuel efficiency, when powders are used in
high-speed internal-combustion engines [113], requiring either
low-speed diesel
nanoparticles [113,118,121], or
engines as previously demonstrated for coal-water or biomass-
water slurries [24]. The propensity of these nanoparticles, or their
metal-oxide (ash) combustion products, to stick to the cylinder
lining can cause wear problems [113], similar to the issues that
accompany coal-water and biomass-water slurry combustion in
diesel engines [24].

the use of

When burning nanoparticles, or metals that burn in the vapor
phase, the production of nano-oxides leads to difficulties in
separating out the oxide products from the gaseous exhaust
[73,113,118], which is needed if the metal fuel is to be recycled
[73]. Emissions of nano-oxide, or unburned nanoparticles, could
result in significant health and safety issues [73]. As discussed
above, nanoparticles also have higher costs, lower energy-cycle

efficiency, lower energy content due to surface oxidation, and
safety issues [60,115,130,245,249].

6.2. Metal-fuelled combustor and applications

It appears more feasible to burn metal fuels in specialized com-
bustors that can be used to produce process heat or power ECEs [90].
Such systems could operate on industrially available micron-sized
powders, resulting in higher energy densities, better energy-cycle
efficiencies, improved safety, and lower costs than nanoparticles. A
power-dense metal-fuelled combustor that could efficiently collect
the resulting metal-oxide combustion products would generate a
high-temperature stream of nitrogen that would be useful for build-
ing and process heating or for generating power at a range of scales,
as shown in Fig. 15. The key technological hurdle for efficient power
generation from such metal fuels is the stabilization of metal-air
combustion within a burner that can capture the solid metal-oxide
combustion products and efficiently transfer heat to a heat load or
engine [90].

6.2.1. Industrial and residential heating

Thirty-seven percent of the fossil fuel burned within US indus-
tries is used to generate steam for process heating or other applica-
tions [23], and metal fuels and the metal combustor could be a low-
carbon replacement for such applications. In this case, the metal
fuels may be considered as power accumulators that enable the
release of very high thermal power rates, when needed, that the grid
may not be able to supply at a given moment. They can also be used
to generate zero-carbon heat in locations without access to a clean
electrical grid or for emergency backup purposes.

6.2.2. Stationary power generation

The similarity between the physical properties of industrial metal
powders and pulverized coal [57] suggests that such powders could
be used in retro-fitted coal or biomass power stations to exploit
existing infrastructure for zero-carbon power generation at grid
scales [90,106,120]. The ability to repurpose existing fossil-fuel pow-
ered facilities with a zero-carbon replacement is a clear advantage of
metal fuels, since it reduces the infrastructure capital expenses dur-
ing the transition to a low-carbon society [106].

Lithium, a light metal with specific energy and energy density
close to current fossil fuels (see Fig. 3), has been proposed as a recy-
clable coal that can be reduced using clean electricity and then
stored, likely in bulk [120,307]. Storing of lithium as a powder leads
to significant safety concerns due to its high reactivity with air and
water [216,217,307]. The lithium can then be melted and burned as
a lithium spray, as shown in Fig. 16, with the products of a hydrocar-
bon-fuel power plant [307(cid:1)311], or with air, to generate clean
power on demand [120]. This can allow capture of carbon dioxide
from flue gases while generating clean power [312], as well as other
value-added chemicals, such as ammonia or carbon monoxide for
hydrocarbon synthesis [120,311]. Other metals, such as magnesium
and aluminum, can also burn with the products of hydrocarbon com-
bustion [304,313(cid:1)318]. Magnesium has been considered as a fuel for

propulsion on Mars since it can be burned with the carbon dioxide in
the Martian atmosphere [313(cid:1)316].

6.2.3. External-combustion engines for motive power

External-combustion heat engines and power-generation sys-
tems are available at a range of power-generation scales, from coal-
fired and nuclear-powered boiler and steam turbines, used ubiqui-
tously today for large-scale power generation, to advanced Stirling
engines or Rankine-cycle engines using steam or organics as the
working fluid [64,296]. A combustion system that can efficiently
burn metal fuels coupled with an external-combustion engine could
lead to efficient motive-power generation for light and heavy duty
transportation vehicles [90].

External-combustion engines, based on the Stirling or Rankine
cycles [64], can achieve high thermal efficiencies (above 60%) [296],
but have never achieved widespread use for transportation because
of their low torque and slow response to load changes. Passenger
vehicles and machinery will likely be increasingly electrified so that
the benefits of hybrid-electric vehicles, including the elimination of
engine idling, use of regenerative braking, and running the engine at
the optimum set point, can be used to improve fuel efficiency
[20,67]. Within plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles, the engine is con-
verted from its role as a prime mover to a range-extending power
generator, eliminating the need for the engine to be able to provide
high torque and to rapidly shift from low to high power mode and,
therefore, enables the use of more-efficient external-combustion
heat engines in place of the current internal-combustion gasoline
and diesel engines [20,90]. Rail locomotives use such hybrid-electric
systems today, based on a diesel generator that then powers elec-
tric-drive motors,
in order to eliminate complex, heavy-duty
mechanical transmissions.

6.3. Stabilized combustion of metal fuels for heat and power

The combustion in a metal-fuelled combustor would most likely
occur with the metal fuel burning in a stabilized turbulent flame, as
shown in Fig. 16 [307]. The essential physics of metal-particle flames
are briefly discussed in this review, and past reviews have exten-
sively discussed the particle combustion regimes, ignition tempera-
tures, and burning times for a variety of metal fuels in different
oxidizers [125,135,319(cid:1)322].

186

6.3.1. Stabilized metal flames

A flame can be stabilized within both turbulent and laminar sus-
pensions of metal sprays/powders in air, as shown in Figs. 16 and 17.
This means that the particle combustion process must be sustained
by the molecular, convective, or radiative heat transfer from
the combustion products
to the fresh, unburned reactants
[143,323(cid:1)325], as occurs in gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon-air
flames. Measurements of laminar metal flame temperature profiles
with interferometry show a narrow preheat zone, (cid:3) 1 mm thick, as
is typical of gaseous flames that rely upon molecular heat transfer
[143]. Burning velocities scale as the square root of the product of
the thermal and oxygen diffusivities of the mixtures, demonstrating
that molecular conduction is the dominant heat-transfer mechanism
in small-scale metal flames [143], as it is for flames burning gaseous
or liquid fuels.

Fig. 18 shows the available data for the burning velocity of a
fuels [297,326,327,329(cid:1)331]. Flames in metal
range of metal
suspensions have received much less study than those for gas-
eous or liquid fuels, and significant experimental uncertainties
remain [331]. The available data demonstrate that suspensions of
micron-sized metal particles can exhibit burning velocities close
to those of hydrocarbon flames [90]. The data also show that the
burning velocity is not very sensitive to fuel concentration for
rich equivalence ratios, because the metal particles do not dis-
place the oxygen in the mixture and, thereby, do not signifi-
cantly dilute the chemical energy per unit volume [143,329]. For
lean metal flames, the pulsating thermo-diffusive instability is
observed [329,332], while rich metal flames exhibit cellular
instabilities [303,329,332].

6.3.2. Metal-particle ignition and combustion regimes

As in all flames, both reaction kinetics and the diffusion of heat
and mass are important phenomena in the combustion of metal par-
ticles. Two regimes of combustion for metal fuels have been widely
discussed in the literature based on limiting phenomena, the: i) dif-
fusion-limited and ii) kinetically-limited regimes [319]. Combustion
in the kinetically-limited regime is very similar to that for homoge-
neous fuel mixtures, with the reaction rates exponentially depen-
dent on the local temperature [319,333], the reaction rate scaling
linearly with oxygen concentration, and the flame structure resem-
bling that of homogenous gaseous flames [334].

If the reaction kinetics are sufficiently fast, the particles can ignite
and transition to the diffusion-limited regime, where diffusion
of oxidizer to the reaction surface is the rate-limiting step
[319,333,334]. Ignition is the critical process where the rate of heat
release from the heterogeneous surface reactions exceeds the rate of
heat loss, causing an abrupt transition to a diffusion-limited com-
bustion mode [319,333(cid:1)335]. The ability of individual particles to
ignite and transition to the diffusion-limited regime leads to the for-
mation of many flames within the flame [301,303], which results in
the unique characteristics of metal flames compared to those of
homogeneous gaseous and evaporated-liquid fuels [90,334]. A parti-
cle burning in the diffusion-limited regime exhibits a flame temper-
ature that is characteristic of the adiabatic flame temperature of a
stoichiometric mixture of the metal with the oxidizing gas (air),
rather than the adiabatic flame temperature of the actual bulk fuel-
air equivalence ratio in the metal-powder/air suspension [319,334].
This is a common behavior in all diffusion-limited flames of hydro-
carbon, and other fuels, with air, such as hydrocarbon fuel droplets

Fig. 17. Stabilized flames of different metal powders compared to a methane-air flame. The flame temperature of a stoichiometric iron-air flame is around 2300 K, similar to that

[336(cid:1)338] or coal [339(cid:1)341]. The diffusion-limited combustion
regime can result in a variety of different micro-flame configura-
tions, as shown in Fig. 19, depending on the volatility of the metal
and the flame temperature [90,319]. The oxide particle sizes exiting
the combustor would strongly depend on the type of combustion
mode, suggesting that fuels that burn heterogeneously (Mode C),
such as iron, would be preferable [90].

6.3.3. Metal flame modeling

Modeling efforts for metal flames have typically employed
asymptotic assumptions of either diffusion-limited or kinetically-
limited combustion [327,334,342]. Due to the reduction in particle
size and oxidizer concentration within a flame, the particle combus-
tion rate may be controlled by a combination of diffusion and kinetic
processes [333,334].

A modeling framework that includes both the diffusion and
kinetic rates in determining the reaction rate of the particles in sus-
pension has been recently re-introduced [334,335], based on the
seminal works of Frank-Kamenetskii [343] and Vulis [344]. The
model employs a single-step Arrhenius surface reaction and cap-
tures the essential physics of heterogenous flames, including the
prediction of ignition and extinction of micro-flames on the particle
surface [335]. Fig. 20a shows the model predictions for the depen-
dence of flame speed on the particle size for different equivalence
ratios. For near-stoichiometric to rich flames, the flame speed
increases with decreasing particle size due to the increasing specific
surface area [334]. For very lean flames, the ability of larger particles
to ignite and burn in the diffusion-limited regime, by forming micro-

flames, enables them to burn at a faster speed than smaller particles
burning in the kinetically-limited regime. This model also predicts a
region of equivalence ratios for very lean flames and intermediate
particle sizes where the flame propagation is unstable due to
sequential ignition and extinction of the particles (see hatched
region in Fig. 20a) [334].

Fig. 20b plots the burning velocity versus equivalence ratio pre-
dicted by this model, which looks similar to that for hydrocarbon
flames except that the model shows a slower falloff to the rich side,
as seen in experiments (c.f. Fig. 18b), due to the fact that addition of
more solid fuel particles does not reduce the oxygen content of the
fuel-air mixture, because of the low specific volume (high density)
of the solid fuel particles.

Future modeling efforts for specific metal fuels must recognize
the need to model both the overall flame structure and the local
micro-flame structures simultaneously. Both experiments and mod-
els suggest that achieving stable metal combustion may require
using stoichiometric to rich metal-fuel suspensions. It is also clear
that the collective effect, where the heat release from burning fuel
particles accelerates the rate of the reaction for the whole suspen-
sion to thermal runaway, must be considered in any model of practi-
cal heterogenous energetic systems [333,335,345].

6.3.4. Enhancing combustion rate of metal-fuelled combustors

Increasing the flame speed of a metal suspension within a com-
bustor would enable a more compact, higher power density, system.
It is well known from combustion of hydrocarbon fuels that flame
mass burning rates can be enhanced by increasing the system

shell or cap. Reprinted from [90] with permission of Elsevier.

pressure, by increasing the initial temperature, and by using turbu-
lence to increase the flame surface area and the mixing rates of reac-
tants with hot products.

The author is unaware of any studies that investigate the change
in the burning rate of metal suspensions in air with increasing pres-
sure. In general, increasing the system pressure will increase the
gas density, oxidizer concentration, and resulting kinetic reaction
rates while reducing the thermal and mass diffusivities. With
increasing pressure, the system is driven towards the diffusion-lim-
ited combustion regime where particle burning times are indepen-
dent of pressure in the ideal case [319]. In reality, changes in
pressure could change the equilibrium combustion products and,
for example, drive the reaction from the vapour phase to the parti-
cle surface, leading to more complex dependencies.

The effect of

initial temperature on metal flames has also
received very little study, but increasing the initial temperature
appears to increase the flame speed with a power law similar to
that for hydrocarbon flames [143]. Only a few studies have investi-
gated, in a controlled manner, the effect of the turbulence intensity
on the resulting flame speed for metal fuels, with the available data
showing an increase [329,346], as expected from homogeneous
flame theory.

Heterogeneous flames have a high radiative emissivity of the
products that can be effectively absorbed by the solid fuel in the
reactants, allowing radiative heat transfer to accelerate the burning
rate in metal flames of sufficient scale [325,329,346]. For laboratory-
scale flames, radiation will only act as a heat loss mechanism [329].
In large-scale flames, radiation heat transfer has been shown to
effectively result in a small amount of preheat of the metal-air mix-
ture that then increases the speed of the metal flame [329].

Studies have also been performed on flame propagation through
hybrid mixtures of metal particles suspended in gaseous-fuel/oxi-
dizer mixtures. It was discovered in these experiments that a sec-
ondary metal flame would form in the products of the primary
hydrocarbon flame only above a critical concentration of the metal
fuel [304,347,348]. This critical concentration results from the
requirement that, in order for the flame fronts to couple together,
the flame speed in the metal suspension must exceed the convective
speed of the products leaving the primary hydrocarbon flame [304].
The observed flame speeds, on the order of several meters per sec-
ond, of metal flames in hydrocarbon-flame products, suggests that
significant flame speed enhancement is possible in highly preheated
flames with significant oxidizer concentrations [90]. The fact that a
secondary metal flame front only forms beyond a critical concentra-
tion also confirms the importance of the collective effect as a key con-
trolling parameter in many metal combustion phenomena.

More research is needed on the effects of initial temperature,
pressure, and turbulence on the burning rates of different metal
fuels.

6.3.5. Emissions from metal flames

The metal fuel cycle does not introduce any undesired carbon
dioxide or other carbon-based pollutant emissions [90], such as car-
bon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones, or
carbon-based particulate matter (soot) that are associated with fos-
sil-fuel and biofuel combustion [20]. The production of nitrogen-
oxide pollutant emissions in metal-air flames has only received lim-
ited study [349]. Fuel-rich metal flames are desirable as they would
lead to stable combustion [143,329] and likely reduce NOx formation
[90], at the expense of incomplete combustion. For hydrocarbon
fuels, purely fuel-rich combustion is avoided since it produces toxic
pollutants, including soot, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon mon-
oxide [20], none of which are possible products of metal combustion
with air [90]. Future work must assess both the level of potential
NOx emissions from metal flames as well as how to mitigate them,

through advanced combustion strategies or

either
exhaust after-treatment.

(catalytic)

6.3.6. Collecting solid metal-oxide products

The combustion system must also produce metal-oxide particles
that are easy to separate from the combustion products, such as using
a cyclone [90]. The use of micron-sized fuel particles that combust in
a heterogeneous reaction mode so as to produce micron-sized metal-
oxide combustion products would simplify the particle collection
process through the use of cyclone, filtration, and electrostatic and
electromagnetic separators [90]. Iron burns in a heterogeneous com-
bustion mode with air at atmospheric pressure, making it a promising
fuel option for the Dry Cycle [90]. Aluminum and magnesium are
known to burn in the vapor phase and produce nanometric oxide
products [350(cid:1)354], that are more difficult to collect than larger par-
ticles. The metal-oxide combustion product morphologies of these
and other metal fuels under different combustion regimes need to be
studied further in order to identify candidate metal fuels and combus-
tor systems that will simplify metal-oxide separation and collection.

7. Intense power generation from metal fuels

Both the energy density, of the fuel, and power density, of the
engine, should be considered in assessing the performance of differ-
ent secondary-energy systems. It was shown in Fig. 3 that metal
fuels can provide energy densities that are better than hydrocarbon
fuels, and significantly exceed those of either batteries or hydrogen-
storage systems.

7.1. Power density of fuel cells, batteries, and engines

The low power density of the most-commonly proposed energy-

_v

storage options can be understood through the following relation:
PV / h qmrm
where PV [kW/L] is the power density of the system, h is its effi-
ciency, qm [kJ/kg] is the specific energy, and rm [kg/L] is the density,
of the fuel-oxidizer mixture, respectively, and _v [1/s] is the charac-
teristic reaction rate [90,91].

ð5Þ

For fuel cells, the low temperature of the reaction necessitates
compensating, to achieve reasonable reaction rates, by increasing
the surface areas of the anode and cathode, increasing the volume of
the fuel cell relative to that of an engine, as well as using expensive
catalysts. Batteries suffer from the same issues; however, the
requirement to carry both the fuel and the oxidizer within the bat-
tery significantly lowers qm. Metal-air batteries aim to improve their
specific energy by using atmospheric air, but the low temperatures
and slow oxidation rates lead to low power densities [71,158]. Bat-
teries have high efficiencies at very low power outputs, but this effi-
ciency drops as the power level is increased due to the dissipation of
energy into heat, caused by the internal resistance of the battery
[71,355].

In order to achieve high power densities, the efficiency, specific
energy of the fuel-oxidizer mixture, density of the mixture, and reac-
tion rate must be maximized. Internal-combustion engines provide
high energy densities through making use of atmospheric air as a
freely-available oxidizer. Such engines achieve high power densities
by employing high pressures, increasing rm, and reacting energy-
dense fuels with air, increasing qm, in a combustion mode at high
thereby maximizing _v through the exponential
temperatures,
dependence of Arrhenius kinetics on temperature.

7.2. Energy and power densities of different clean energy systems

The tradeoff between the specific energy and power, or energy
and power densities, of different batteries is often presented on a

num-fuelled engine (Al), and fossil-fuelled engine (FF). Adapted from [91].

Ragone plot [355], shown in Fig. 21. For batteries, high specific
power levels require low internal, or Th(cid:1)evenin equivalent, resistan-
ces, which lead to high values of self-discharge and lower specific
energies, or energy-storage efficiencies. To improve the energy-stor-
age capacities, high internal resistances are needed. While batteries
can show very high potential energy-cycle efficiencies, above 80%,
under trickle-charge conditions, their internal resistance leads to
high losses during fast charging and discharging, reducing the
energy-cycle efficiency [70,71,355]. Fuel cells also operate on elec-
trochemical reactions and have similar Ragone curves to batteries.

Engine technologies show a similar tradeoff on a Ragone plot for
different reasons [91]. The specific energy is the fuel energy divided
by the mass of the engine, the fuel tank, and the stored fuel, while
the specific power is found by dividing the engine power by the
mass of the fuel system and engine. If a large amount of fuel is car-
ried on board, the specific power goes to zero while the specific
energy increases to that of the fuel-storage system. If a small amount
of fuel is carried, then the specific energy drops to zero while the
specific power increases to that of the engine.

Metal flames have similar burning velocities, or reaction rates, to
hydrocarbon fuels and the specific energies and energy densities are
comparable, leading to comparable specific powers and power den-
sities. The specific power of an aluminum-fuelled engine is esti-
mated [91] and compared to the hydrocarbon-fuelled engines,
batteries, and hydrogen-fuelled fuel cells in Fig. 21. The metal-
fuelled system achieves values close to that of our current fossil-
fuelled machines and significantly exceeds that of batteries or of
hydrogen fuel-cell systems. Note that the logarithmic scales tradi-
tionally used in Ragone plots tend to de-emphasize what are large
differences in the practicality of different power systems — every
order of magnitude counts.

8. Outlook and future research directions

This review argues that recyclable metals are the most viable
chemical energy carriers, or electrofuels, and globally-tradable sus-
tainable energy commodities that have been proposed to date, due to
their high mass and volumetric energy densities, the ability to pro-
duce/recycle them with zero-carbon reduction processes, their
promising energy-cycle efficiencies compared to other zero-carbon
chemical-energy storage options, their low cost compared to batter-
ies using the same metal as fuel, the ability to transport them via
existing ship, rail, and truck transportation networks, and the capa-
bility to store them for extended time periods without loss as part of
energy stockpiles. The energy density of metals is significantly
higher than for natural gas, or even petroleum (see Fig. 3), making
them better for energy stockpiles and international trade. The metal

fuels could be produced in locations with excess primary-generation
capacity, such as countries near the equator with low population
density, and be sold to countries with insufficient clean primary-
energy generation capacity, such as populous northern countries.
They could also be used to store excess clean energy, in a stockpile,
during sunny or windy periods and provide backup for times when
the clean energy is not available due to failures or outages. No other
concept has been proposed to date that could provide such conve-
nient grid-scale backup or long-distance trade in clean energy with-
out any intrinsic carbon-dioxide emissions.

These recyclable metal fuels can provide high-intensity on-
demand power, in the form of thermal, electrical, or motive power,
over nearly the full range of applications where fossil-derived hydro-
carbon fuels are used today. A key technological barrier to the use of
metal fuels is the lack of efficient power-generation equipment that
can convert the chemical energy in metal fuels into motive or elec-
trical energy at sufficient rates for compact power applications. This
review has shown that there are two main routes that can be
exploited: the reaction with water as an intermediate stage (Wet
Cycle), or direct combustion with air (Dry Cycle).

If the Wet Cycle is operated at low reaction temperatures, then
up to half of the energy stored in the metal fuels is lost and the
resulting energy-cycle efficiency and energy/power densities are sig-
nificantly reduced. Alternatively, the reaction of coarse metal pow-
ders, such as magnesium and aluminum, with liquid water has been
demonstrated to produce nearly 100% of the theoretical hydrogen
release, along with heat from the exothermic reaction, at elevated
temperatures and pressures. The metal-water reaction can also
occur in a high-temperature flame mode, likely requiring finer parti-
cle sizes or reaction-promoting chemical additives to achieve stable
burning. The heat and hydrogen produced can be used to generate
motive or electrical power using a combination of turbine genera-
tors, thermoelectric generators, internal-combustion/external-com-
bustion engines, or fuel cells. Higher-temperature reactions are
required to enable the heat produced during the metal-water reac-
tion to be extracted as useful work, due to the Carnot principles.

Research is needed on the oxidation of different metal powders
with liquid water at elevated temperatures and, specifically, above
its critical point, where the solubility of oxides and hydroxides could
change significantly and enhance reaction rates and yields. The capa-
bility to produce hot hydrogen at high production rates makes
metal-water propellants potentially attractive fuels for advanced
air-breathing engines, which are needed for high-speed transport
and space access, or compact zero-carbon power systems. Future
research should focus on optimal cycles for generating stationary,
motive, or propulsive power from the hot hydrogen produced
from metal-water reactors. For systems based on the metal-water

190

reaction followed by hydrogen-steam combustion in air, or its con-
sumption in a fuel cell, the possible advantages, such as simplifying
the separation and collection of the oxidized metal reaction products
and lower NOx emissions, must be weighed against the increased
powertrain complexity and lower energy/power densities compared
to the direct-combustion route where particles are burned directly
with air without using water as an intermediate reactant.

The sustained combustion of micron-sized metal powders or
sprays, with air or other oxidizers, has been demonstrated in both
laminar and turbulent flames. Such flames can be used as a heat
source for thermal power or can be coupled to an external-combus-
tion engine for power generation, through the Dry Cycle, at scales
ranging from passenger vehicles to grid-scale power generation in
retro-fitted coal or biomass power plants. The use of combustion
and heat engines could provide power and energy densities compa-
rable to fossil-fuelled internal-combustion engines, but with abso-
lutely no carbon emissions if the metal oxides are recycled to
reactive metal fuels using clean, zero-carbon primary energy sour-
ces. Iron is an interesting recyclable fuel due to the fact that it is
widely available, has a low cost, is non-toxic, and can be recycled
without CO2 emissions using today’s technology. Iron has flame tem-
peratures close to those of hydrocarbons and can produce large
oxide particles, due to iron’s heterogeneous combustion process,
that can simplify their collection. The relatively low combustion
temperatures in iron flames will lead to lower thermal-NOx emis-
sions. Another promising option that has received very little study is
the combustion of silicon powders. Lithium is another interesting
recyclable fuel, likely for stationary applications, that can be reacted
with flue gases or air.

Our understanding of heterogeneous flames of metal fuels lags
far behind that for gaseous or liquid fuels. Much more work
remains to fully understand the laminar and turbulent combustion
properties of metal flames, burning in both air and in the products
of hydrocarbon or hydrogen flames. Experiments on flame propaga-
tion and stabilization in both laminar and turbulent flows are
needed. Models are needed to predict the flame speeds, thermal
structures, and stabilization properties of these multi-phase flames.
Research is also needed to assess the oxide-product particle-size
distributions from different metal fuels burning under different
conditions (oxidizer compositions, flame temperatures, etc.) to find
operating points that will lead to effective collection of the combus-
tion products for recycling purposes. The mechanism(s) of NOx pol-
lutant formation within metal flames also deserve attention to
enable the design of ultra-low-emissions combustors that can con-
vert the chemical energy within metal fuels into clean thermal
energy.

The Dry and Wet Cycles could both be operated at a range of
scales from motive power for transportation to large-scale stationary
power generation. Advances in clean primary power generation and
development of efficient technologies to reduce metal oxides to
reactive metals using minimal clean energy inputs are also topics of
active research interest that are critical to a transition to a low-car-
bon global economy, since metals are a major component material
for the manufacturing of everything from personal electronics to
transportation vehicles and for the construction of buildings and
infrastructure. Technological developments for both the production
of metal fuels and their utilization in power generation systems will
further improve the prospects for using metals as sustainable energy
commodities. While such a transition would require a significant
and long-term investment, the overall investment in converting our
power system from fossil to metal fuels should be lower than that
for hydrogen, or other options, due to the ability to repurpose exist-
ing infrastructure, including metal smelters, rail cars, cargo ships,
and coal or biomass power plants, to produce, transport, and con-
sume metal fuels. Metal fuels should be seriously considered as elec-
trofuel options for a future low-carbon economy since they show

significant potential compared to the other proposed low-carbon
options.
