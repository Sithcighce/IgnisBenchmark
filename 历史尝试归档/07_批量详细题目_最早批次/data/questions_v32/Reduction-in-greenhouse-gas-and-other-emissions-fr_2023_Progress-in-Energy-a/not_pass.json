    "question_text": "Using the concept of Well-to-Wake (WtW) emissions, compare the lifecycle GHG impact of e-methanol versus fossil marine diesel. Include the role of renewable electricity in hydrogen production and the implications for carbon neutrality based on the WtW GHG emissions factors provided in the paper.",
    "standard_answer": "The WtW GHG emissions for e-methanol and fossil marine diesel are calculated as: WtW = upstream (WtT) + downstream (TtW). For e-methanol, upstream includes electrolysis for H2 and CO2 capture. The efficiency η_electrolysis ≈ 60–70%, so H2 production energy = 55 MJ/kg H2. For e-methanol synthesis: CO2 + 3H2 → CH3OH + H2O. With wind electricity (7–56 gCO2eq/kWh), WtW ≈ 5–20 gCO2eq/MJ (Table 1). Fossil marine diesel (HFO) WtW ≈ 99 gCO2eq/MJ. E-methanol WtW ≈ 18 gCO2eq/MJ [1]. Fossil diesel WtW ≈ 73 gCO2eq/MJ for road transport [72,73], but for marine HFO ≈ 99 gCO2eq/MJ. Carbon neutrality requires WtW ≈ 0. E-methanol's upstream dominates: if renewable electricity has 7 gCO2eq/kWh, CO2eq for e-methanol ≈ 7 × (55/3.6) ≈ 107 gCO2eq/MJ without CCS. For renewable H2 (green), upstream ≈ 4.9 gCO2/MJ [78]. Thus, e-methanol can achieve carbon neutrality only if the electricity carbon intensity is negligible. E-methanol's downstream TtW emissions are similar to fossil methanol but with zero upstream fossil carbon. The carbon emitted was captured from air (CCU), closing the carbon loop. The calculation: CO2eq_e-methanol = (E_H2 × CI_elec) + CO2_capture_energy). Total: WtW = 18 + (captured CO2 emission). The synthesis reaction's thermodynamic efficiency η_synthesis ≈ 70%. Thus, lifecycle GHG = Σ(stages energy × emission factor). For fossil diesel, upstream ≈ 87 gCO2eq/MJ. The difference highlights the importance of using renewable electricity to achieve true carbon neutrality, as fossil diesel emits 99 gCO2eq/MJ, so e-methanol reduces emissions by ≈80%.",
