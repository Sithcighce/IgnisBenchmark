    "question_text": "Calculate the expected flow rate loss after 100 hours for a fuel with K₁=0.8 %/h and K₂=0.05 h⁻¹. Compare this with a case where K₂ is doubled due to higher injection pressure. Discuss the implications for engine design.",
    "standard_answer": "Using the equation: Fuel flow rate loss = -K₁/K₂·(1 - e^(-K₂·t)). Case 1: K₁=0.8, K₂=0.05, t=100 h. Loss = -(0.8/0.05)·(1 - e^(-0.05·100)) = -16·(1 - e^(-5)) = -16·(1 - 0.0067 = -15.89%. Case 2 with doubled K₂=0.1 h⁻¹: Loss = -(0.8/0.1)·(1 - e^(-0.1·100)) = -8·(1 - e^(-10)) = -8·(1 - 0.000045) ≈ -8%. This shows increasing injection pressure to double K₂ reduces deposit accumulation by half. For engine design, this suggests optimizing injection pressure is crucial. However, higher pressure increases parasitic losses. The optimal balance depends on fuel properties and injector type. This calculation validates that 'higher injection pressure contributes to increase the deposit removal rate.' Engine designers must balance between deposit control and system efficiency.",
