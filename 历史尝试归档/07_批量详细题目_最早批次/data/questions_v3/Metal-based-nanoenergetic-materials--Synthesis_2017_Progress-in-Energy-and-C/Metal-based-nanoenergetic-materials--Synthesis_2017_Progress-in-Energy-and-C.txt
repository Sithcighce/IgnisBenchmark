Metal particles are attractive candidate fuels for various propulsion and energy-conversion applications, pri-
marily due to their high energy densities. Micron-sized particles present several drawbacks, such as high igni-
tion temperatures and particle agglomeration, resulting in low energy-release rates. Nanoparticles, on the
other hand, are quite attractive due to their unique and favorable properties, which are attributed to their
high specific surface area and excess energy of surface atoms. As a result, there is a growing interest in
employing metal nanoparticles in propulsion and energy-conversion systems. The present work provides a
comprehensive review of the advances made over the past few decades in the areas of synthesis, properties,
and applications of metal-based energetic nanomaterials. An overview of existing methods to synthesize nano-
materials is first provided. Novel approaches to passivate metal nanoparticles are also discussed. The physico-
chemical properties of metal nanoparticles are then examined in detail. Low-temperature oxidation processes,
and ignition and combustion of metal nanoparticles are investigated. The burning behaviors of different ener-
getic material formulations with metal nanoparticles such as particle-laden dust clouds, solid propellants,
liquid fuels and propellants, thermite materials, and inter-metallic systems are reviewed. Finally, deficiencies
and uncertainties in our understanding of the field are identified, and directions for future work are suggested.

1. Introduction

PEnergetic materials release large amounts of chemical energy
quickly in the form of heat during combustion. In monomolecular
energetic materials, fuel and oxidizer groups are present within a
single molecule and the reaction rate is thus controlled by break-
ing and formation of chemical bonds (chemical kinetics) [1]. The
energy densities of monomolecular energetic materials are, how-
limited [1]. This can be attributed to chemical stability
ever,
requirements and limitations on the physical density of materials
[2]. Composite energetic materials, on the other hand, are synthe-
sized by physical mixing of fuel and oxidizer particles. Fig. 1
shows a composite energetic nanomaterial consisting of aluminum
and molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) particles [3]. The nano-alumi-
num particles are spherical in shape and have an average diame-
ter of 80 nm, while the MoO3 particles are sheet-like particles
with a length of 1 mm and thickness of 20 nm. The solid propel-
lant employed in the U.S. Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters is
another example of a composite energetic material. It consists of

Pammonium perchlorate crystals and aluminum particles in a poly-
mer binder [4]. The overall reaction rate of composite energetic
materials is typically controlled by mass diffusion, since the fuel
and oxidizer particles are separate entities [1]. The resulting rates
of energy release are lower than the corresponding values that
could be attained in a kinetically-controlled process [1].

PThe energy density of conventional energetic materials can be
substantially increased by the addition of metal particles. Fig. 2
shows enthalpies of combustion of monomolecular energetic mate-
rials and metals in pure oxygen under stoichiometric conditions. On
a volumetric basis, the enthalpy of combustion of metals is as high
as 138 kJ/cm3, substantially greater than those of monomolecular
compounds (»10(cid:1)30 kJ/cm3). One of the most energetic, beryllium,
is seldom used, due to its extreme toxicity, relative scarcity, and
high cost [5]. Among the elements listed here, boron has the highest
volumetric energy density of 138 kJ/cm3. Ignition of boron particles
is, however, significantly delayed by the presence of an oxide (B2O3)
layer [6(cid:1)8]. The ignition temperatures of boron particles in oxygen-
ated environments vary in the range of 1500(cid:1)1950 K, regardless of

PNanoparticles have recently attracted considerable attention due
to their unique and favorable physicochemical properties, as com-
pared with their micron-sized counterparts [19]. For example, bulk
gold is a well-known inert material. If the diameter of gold particles
is reduced to 1(cid:1)5 nm, they exhibit excellent catalytic properties
[20]. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles are size
dependent. For example, the melting temperature of nano-alumi-
num particles decreases with decreasing particle size, from about
930 K at 10 nm to 673 K at 3 nm [21]. A qualitatively similar trend is
observed for the ignition temperature of aluminum particles. It
decreases with decreasing particle size, from a value as high as
2350 K at 100 mm to »1000 K at 100 nm [15].

Pparticle size [6,8]. In certain cases, energy release is significantly
diminished in hydrogen-containing gases by the formation of meta-
stable HBO2 species [7]. These difficulties of ignition and combustion
have limited the utilization of boron in practical applications, but
novel passivation materials and approaches are being considered to
enhance the combustion characteristics of boron particles. Bellott
for example, employed halogen based passivation
et al.
materials and studied the oxidation of 10(cid:1)150 nm boron particles
using thermogravimetric analysis at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The combustion efficiency of fluorine-coated boron particles was
estimated to be »75%, greater than that of conventional boron
particles (»50%) [10].

[9],

PAluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust and is
relatively safe to use [4]. Aluminum particles can be used in space
[4] and underwater [11] propulsion, explosions [12], pyrotechnics
[13], and hydrogen generation applications [14]. One of the main
issues concerning micron-sized aluminum (Al) particles is their high
ignition temperatures [15]. Micron-sized and larger Al particles
ignite at temperatures as high as 2350 K [15], and this high ignition
temperature contributes to lower energy-release rates in various
practical applications. Another important issue is particle agglomer-
ation [16,17], which lower the performance by as much as 10% [5].
As micron-sized Al particles ignite at higher temperatures, particles
tend to coalesce and agglomerate on the propellant surface in a solid
rocket motor [18]. The presence of agglomerates results in two-
phase flow losses, as they slow the velocity of the flow, and fail to
fully transfer the thermal energy of the flow [5].

PThe unique behavior of nanoparticles can be partly attributed
to the presence of a large number of atoms on the surface and
the excess energy associated with these surface atoms. Fig. 3
shows the effect of particle size on the fraction of atoms in the
surface layer of aluminum particles. The fraction of atoms in
the surface layer of the particle, f, can be calculated using the
following equation [22]:
(cid:1)
f D 1¡ 1¡ 2d
Dp

(cid:3)3

ð1Þ

;

where Dp is the particle diameter and d the thickness of the surface
layer. The surface layer thickness can be taken to be equal to
the atomic diameter of aluminum (286 pm). The fraction of surface
atoms in the particle increases from 0.17 to 16%, when the particle
size decreases from 1 mm to 10 nm. The surface atoms have lower
coordination numbers and greater energies than the atoms in the
interior regions of the particle. As a result, properties of the particle
are size dependent at nano-scales.

PAlthough aluminum nanoparticles tend to have lower ignition
temperatures than their micron-sized counterparts, the problem of
sintering and aggregation persists due to solid-state diffusion and/or
viscous flow [23]. Furthermore, the high specific surface area of
nanoparticles (»10(cid:1)50 m2/g) can result in high propellant viscosity
[24] and poor mechanical strength [25]. These can decrease propel-
lant density, produce erratic combustion, or even cause motor failure
[26]. For these reasons, nanoaluminum particles are not currently
used in practical solid propellants.

PUse of metal nanoparticles in practical applications is also inhib-
ited by low active metal content. Metal particles are covered by a
passivating oxide layer; for aluminum, the oxide layer thickness is in
the range of 2(cid:1)4 nm [27]. Fig. 4 shows the effect of particle size
on the mass fraction of the oxide layer in an aluminum particle.
The oxide layer thickness is taken to be 3 nm. The mass fraction of
the oxide layer increases with decreasing particle size, reaching a

Pvalue of about 50% of the particle mass at 38 nm, and the particle
energy density is substantially diminished. Attempts to enhance the
aluminum content of nano-aluminum particles have met with
mixed results. For example, replacement of the alumina layer
with nickel coating increases the active aluminum content of nano-
aluminum particles by only about 4% [28]. Other materials such
as perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids [29,30] and oleic and stearic
acids [31] have also been considered to enhance the energetics of
nanoaluminum particles.

PIt should be noted that although nanoparticles, in theory, prom-
ise good energy release rates, they pose serious safety issues during
particle synthesis, handling, and storage. Nascent metal nanopar-
ticles are pyrophoric and can ignite spontaneously when exposed to
an oxidizing gas at room temperature [22]. For micron-sized and
larger particles, oxidation reactions typically result in the formation
of a stable 2(cid:1)4 nm thick oxide layer [32]. At nano-scales, the heat
release due to chemical reactions could be sufficient to ignite par-
ticles due to their low volumetric heat capacity. For example,
nascent aluminum particles with diameters lower than a critical
value are predicted to be pyrophoric, and theoretical analysis sug-
gests that the critical particle size varies in the range of 10(cid:1)100 nm
[22,33,34]. Great care must therefore be taken when handling metal
nanoparticles.

PThe potential benefits of nanomaterials have not yet been
completely realized. As mentioned in the context of aluminum,
nanoparticles aggregate significantly before and during combustion
[35]. Although the initial powder may consist of nano-sized par-
ticles, aggregates have lower specific surface area and diminish the
reactivity of the powder. The conventional method of preparing
composite energetic materials consists of physical mixing of fuel
and oxidizer particles by hand or by sonication. Fig. 5 shows a scan-
ning electron micrograph of aggregates of nano-sized Al and CuO
particles prepared using the sonication method [36]. It is apparent
that the mixture consists of aggregates that lack uniformity in size
and shape, with diffusion length scales on the order of few microns
[36]. Recent advances in molecular self-assembly, supramolecular
chemistry, and synthesis techniques that link nano and macro-scale
structures are likely to pave the way for advanced next-generation
nano-engineered energetic materials. These materials will have
higher energy density, improved chemical responsiveness, better
controlled energy and mass generation rates, enhanced reliability
and reproducibility, reduced sensitivity and enhanced safety, and
increased storage life.

PRecent advances in the fabrication and use of metal-based nano-
energetic materials, and the prospect of further progress in the field
in the near future, demand a comprehensive review of the literature.

particles prepared using the sonication method (reprinted from [36] with permission

PPrevious reviews on the subject have tended to focus on specific
aspects or issues. In these reviews, more emphasis was placed on
subjects such as classical theories and applications [37], manufactur-
ing processes and nanocomposite energetic materials [38], ignition
mechanisms [39], combustion of nano-aluminum particles [40], and
the role of nanoenergetics in MEMS [41]. Tremendous progress has
been made in the past decade, however.

PThe overall aim of the present study is therefore to conduct an
up-to-date comprehensive review and compile and discuss findings
pertaining to the synthesis, properties, and applications of metal-
based nanoenergetic materials.
Isolated metal nanoparticles and
powders and energetic material formulations based on metal nano-
particles including particle laden dust clouds, liquid fuels, solid and
liquid propellants, thermite, and intermetallic systems are discussed.
The work is organized into 15 sections. Section 2 provides an over-
view of techniques employed to synthesize nanomaterials. Novel
approaches for passivating metal particles are discussed in Section 3.
Section 4 reviews the physicochemical properties of metal nanopar-
ticles. Sections 5 and 6 concern low-temperature oxidation processes
and the pyrophoricity of metal nanoparticles, respectively. Sections 7
and 8 address respectively the ignition and combustion behaviors of
metal nanoparticles. The burning behaviors of different energetic
material formulations based on metal nanoparticles including parti-
cle-laden dust clouds, liquid fuels and propellants, particle and liquid
oxidizer systems, solid propellants, thermites, and inter-metallic sys-
tems are reviewed in Sections 9-14, respectively. Conclusions and
directions for future work are provided in Section 15.

2. Material synthesis

PMaterial synthesis involves manufacture of nascent metal par-
ticles and passivation in a well-controlled oxidizing environment.
Passivation ensures stability and preserves the active metal content
of the particles. If possible, the manufacturing process should meet
the following requirements: (1) applicability to a variety of materials
(including metals and oxides); (2) ability to produce a wide and con-
trollable range of particle sizes; (3) absence of impurities; (4) pre-
vention of spontaneous reactions and agglomeration; (5) high level
of productivity and economy; and (6) reproducibility. For laboratory
studies, micron-sized particulates are manufactured by punch press-
ing of foils [42] and mechanical chopping of wires [43]; the resulting
particles are ignited using a laser beam. Micro-arc discharge [44]
and the plasma-jet technique [45] have also been employed to create
molten metal droplets from a consumable electrode. In inert gas
atomization, the molten metal stream is atomized by the impinge-
ment of an inert carrier gas. The resulting droplets condense to form
solid particles. Particles produced using this technique has been

Pemployed in a number of research works [46,47]. Note that in most
studies, commercially available powders were employed. Manufac-
ture of metal nanoparticles is an active research field and progress
is expected in the near future. Commonly used methods of
manufacturing nanoparticles are electric explosion of wires, inert
gas condensation, flame synthesis, wet chemistry methods, and
mechanical milling.

2.1. Electric explosion of wires

PUltrafine powders were first produced using electric explosion of
wires by Abrams for radioactive aerosols [48]. The process was later
applied to metals [49(cid:1)60], alloys and inter-metallic compounds
[61(cid:1)64] and oxides [50,59,65,66]. In this technique, the wire explo-
des under the action of large current density. Fig. 6 shows the sche-
matic of the experimental setup [67]. The capacitor battery is first
charged from the power source. The wire driving mechanism feeds
the wire into the gap between electrodes. When the wire reaches
the high-voltage electrode, the commutator operates and electric
discharge occurs. The energy density in the wire exceeds the binding
energy of the material and the wire explodes and releases a mixture
of superheated vapor and boiling droplets into the ambient gas. The
expansion of vapor and collision with ambient gas molecules cools
the vapor, providing conditions for homogeneous nucleation of the
solid phase. Inert gas is typically used to synthesize powders of met-
als and inter-metallic compounds, while chemically active gas such
as oxygen is employed for oxides, carbides, and nitrides. The metal
clusters coalesce and condense to form nano-sized particles, which
are collected on the walls of the vessel. The particles are then passiv-
ated in a well-controlled oxidizing environment [31,54,55,68]. Elec-
tric explosion of wires has also been performed in liquid medium
[58,69,70]. A notable advantage of exploding wires in a liquid
medium is that the formation of micron-sized particles is suppressed
due to the higher energy density, sufficient volume expansion, and
faster cooling of the particles [58].

PIn the electric explosion process, the key parameters of concern
are the energy density [52,53,71,72], pressure [50,57,59,60,73], gas
environment [57], and wire radius [74]. Fig. 7 shows the effect of
energy density on the size of particles produced by the electric
explosion method [53]. For low energy densities, particle size is
strongly dependent on energy density. This has been attributed to
formation
the

transition between mechanisms of particle

Pmechanism, from liquid droplet to condensation nuclei (ions) mech-
anism [53]. The energy density, however, exerts a much weaker
effect on the particle size for energy densities greater than the subli-
mation energy of the wire. In this regime, particles are formed only
on the condensation nuclei, which are typically ions [53]. An
increase in energy density results in an increase in number of ions
and expansion velocity, thus resulting in smaller particle sizes [53].
Smaller particles can also be obtained by decreasing the gas pressure
[50,57,59,60,73]. A lower pressure facilitates higher expansion
velocity and fewer collisions (which are necessary for the growth of
nuclei), thereby decreasing the particle size [75]. Particles tend
to have a more spherical shape when they are formed at higher
pressures [60].

PParticle characteristics also depend on the type of ambient
gas. Fig. 8 shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of nanoaluminum particles produced in three different ambient
gases and at different pressures [57]. Particles produced in nitro-
gen are highly irregular in shape, but the particles are spherical
when formed in argon and helium environments. Although parti-
cle size decreases with decreasing pressure in argon, the situa-
tion is different for helium and nitrogen. It is speculated that gas
thermal conductivity could influence size distribution as well.
These phenomena are not properly understood and needs further
investigation. The ambient gas also influences the content of par-
ticles [57]. The active aluminum content is diminished, for exam-
ple, in a nitrogen environment due to the formation of aluminum
nitride. The electric explosion process features high production
rates and efficiency, with limited environmental contamination
[75]. The particle size, however, typically ranges from a few
nanometers to microns [76]. Achieving a narrow particle size dis-
tribution remains a major challenge.

2.2. Vaporization-condensation method

POne of the most straightforward and simplest ways to synthesize
nanoparticles is the vaporization-condensation method [77(cid:1)80].
The approach is to achieve supersaturation by vaporizing the bulk
material and cooling the resulting vapors by expansion, mixing with
cooler gas, or by heat transfer. The resulting conditions favor
the nucleation of the solid phase. Fig. 9 shows a schematic of the
experimental setup of the inert gas condensation method [81].
The powder processing chamber is evacuated to a very low pressure
(»10-4 mbar) and refilled with an inert gas. The metal wire is then
fed onto the evaporator, which is a Joule-heated tungsten boat.
The evaporator vaporizes the metal and vapors are carried by the
inert gas flow into the chamber, where they condense to form

filter tube.

PThe formation and growth of particles in vaporization-condensa-
tion has been the focus of a number of theoretical studies [82(cid:1)88].
Smaller particles can generally be obtained by lowering the pressure
and molecular weight of the gas [78,81(cid:1)83,86]. If the pressure is

Plowered, the vapor diffuses away from the evaporator and nucle-
ation zones become more spread out [89]. This prevents particle
growth by coagulation. Similarly, lighter inert gas atoms are less
effective in confining the metal vapor and take away less momen-
tum and energy from metal atoms during collisions [89], and so pro-
duce smaller particles. Other methods to lower particle size include
increasing the cooling rate [82], adding oxygen [81], decreasing
the wire feed rate [81], and imposing a forced convective flow on the
inert gas [90,91]. Passivation is accomplished in oxygen gas and/or
liquid solutions [92].

PPowders of metal oxides can be synthesized by oxidizing metal
particles produced by the conventional vaporization-condensation
method [93(cid:1)95] or by performing vaporization-condensation in a
chemically active gas [96]. Note that materials with low boiling tem-
peratures can be vaporized in a crucible or an oven. The temperature
limits of oven or crucible material can restrict direct vaporization of
high boiling point materials. More sophisticated techniques, such
as inductive heating [97(cid:1)99], laser heating/ablation [100(cid:1)109], arc
discharge [103,110], and sputtering [111(cid:1)113] can be employed.
While laser ablation is the process of removing material from a solid
by irradiating it with a laser beam, sputtering involves bombarding
the target material with high-velocity ions or atoms of an inert gas.

PA notable adaptation of the conventional vaporization-condensa-
tion technique is the chemical vapor condensation (CVC) method,
where the evaporative source is replaced by a chemical source
[114(cid:1)117]. This process combines rapid thermal decomposition and
expansion of a precursor/carrier gas stream in a hot tubular reactor/

Pfurnace with rapid condensation of the product particle species on a
cold substrate [114]. This method, however, has some drawbacks,
including incomplete heat transfer to precursor molecules, deposi-
tion of clusters on the furnace wall, and impurity entrainment from
reactor walls [115,116]. This issue can be avoided by using the com-
bustion flame chemical vapor condensation (CF-CVC) method [115].
In this method, precursor molecules are pyrolyzed by the flame,
which is located outside the combustor [115]. Aggregation effects
can be minimized by optimizing process parameters [118].

PA wide range of materials can be produced by inert gas condensa-
tion [89]. Furthermore, the particle size distribution can be con-
trolled by altering process parameters [89]. One of the major
drawbacks of inert gas condensation is, however, particle agglomer-
ation [89]. Van der Waals forces caused by temporally varying
charge distribution in particles result in agglomeration. Cost is
another issue, as the entire process needs to be carried out in ultra-
high vacuum conditions [89]. Furthermore, it is not always easy to
scale up this process, so the amount of powders produced per batch
may be limited [89].

2.3. Flame synthesis

PFlame synthesis is a one-step process with no moving parts and
machinery [119(cid:1)122]. The resulting powders are highly pure, since
the flame acts as a self-purifying environment by driving out volatile
impurities [119]. Flame synthesis is typically used to synthesize
metal oxides, due to the oxidizing nature of the flame environment
[116,123,124], although metal powders have also been produced
[125(cid:1)127]. The process can be scaled up easily and can thus offer
high production rates [119]. Calcote and Felder [128], for example,
obtained silicon particles at a rate of 1.5 kg/hr in a rocket motor com-
bustor. In this method, the precursor material (such as SiCl4 for pro-
ducing SiO2 nanoparticles) is injected into the burner as a gas, liquid
droplet, or solid particle. The precursor vaporizes due to the energy
supplied by the flame. The vapors decompose and react to form
molecular clusters, which eventually grow by coagulation and/or
surface reactions and form nano-sized particles. The resulting aero-
sol stream leaves the high temperature region and cools down to
sufficiently low temperatures for particle collection.

PFig. 10 shows a schematic of some of the commonly used
burner configurations [121]. Premixed flame [116,129,130], co-flow
diffusion flame [124,125,131,132], counter-flow diffusion flame
[133,134], and spray flame [123,135(cid:1)140] burners are typically
employed. Coarser particles are obtained by increasing the collision
frequency of precursor molecules and providing energy to drive the
growth of the particles. This can be accomplished by increasing the
flame temperature and precursor concentration and by enhanced
mixing of fuel and precursor streams [124]. In spray burners, the
precursor is injected in the form of a spray of liquid droplets into the
thermal zone. Inside the thermal zone, the solvent evaporates and
reactions occur within each particle to form a product particle. The
main advantage of this method is that multi-component materials
can be synthesized [136], as solutions of different metal salts can be
mixed and aerosolized into the reaction zone. Particle size can be
controlled by modulating the flow rate and oxidizer composition
[135].

POne of the main challenges of the flame synthesis method is par-
ticle agglomeration [125], although mitigation has been attempted.
Dufaux and Axelbaum [125] condensed sodium chloride (NaCl) on
particles using a sodium co-flow flame in order to minimize agglom-
eration. The coating was then removed by washing with water and
sublimating at 800 °C in vacuum. Other strategies for reducing parti-
cle size in the flame synthesis process include using dopants [141],
applying an electric field [142,143], laser irradiation [144], blowing
of cold inert gas and nozzle-quenching [145,146]. When an electric
field is applied across the flame, ionic wind is generated across the

burner; (b) counterflow diffusion flame burner; (c) multiannulus coflow diffusion

Pflame, decreasing the flame height, increasing the flame cooling rate
[143], and resulting in shorter particle residence time at high tem-
peratures [142]. Furthermore, charging of the particles results in
electrostatic repulsion and dispersion. These effects result
in
reduced coagulation rates [142]. Similarly, the presence of dopants
results in the formation of interstitial solid solutions, which decrease
the sintering rate of particles [141]. Although laser irradiation
enhances the sintering rate, it produces spherical particles which
have lower collision cross sections and growth rates [144].

2.4. Wet-chemistry methods

PWet-chemistry involves chemical reactions in liquids that in turn
result in the formation of a solid phase [147]. The process begins
with the nucleation of the first few molecules of the solid phase, fol-
lowed by the growth of solid crystals, which is a thermodynamically
favored process due to the decrease in the specific surface energy.
The wet-chemistry method is a well-developed synthesis method
that can yield uniform and controlled particle shape and size distri-
bution [148,149]. It has been employed to synthesize nanoparticles
of metals [28,149(cid:1)153] and oxides [1,154(cid:1)158] and core-shell
structured particles [28,29,159(cid:1)161]. Wet-chemistry methods are
attractive due to the inherent safety of handling nanoparticles in a
liquid medium [162], but the process is more of an art than a science
and it features numerous additional steps, including filtration, wash-
ing, and drying.

POne common solution method used to synthesize metal nano-
particles
is decomposition of a suitable precursor material
[28,29,150,151,159]. Nanoaluminum particles have been synthe-
sized by decomposing alane-adducts in a xylene solvent containing
a titanium catalyst [150]. Effective adduct species were reported to
be triakyl amines, tetramethylethylenediamine, aromatic amines,
and ethers. The catalyst was added before or after heating the alane
adduct solution. (Alternatively, the alane adduct can be added to a
preheated catalyst solution). The particles were then separated from
the solution by filtration or cannulation of the solvent. Passivation
was achieved by exposing the solution to air or by controlled admis-
sion of air to the dried powder. Highly uniform particles were
obtained; the particle size can be varied in the range of 65(cid:1)500 nm
by adjusting the catalyst concentration and adduct species. Alterna-
tive synthetic routes have also been explored. One such method is
the reaction of aluminum acetylacetonate with lithium aluminum
hydride in mesitylene solution to produce aluminum nanoparticles
with carbonaceous residue that passivated the powder [163].

PAnother important wet-chemistry method is the sol-gel process
[1,147,154,156,157,164,165], which is mainly used to synthesize
metal-oxide nanoparticles. A reactive metal precursor such as metal
alkoxide (M-OR) is used. In the first step, the precursor is hydrolyzed
with water, resulting in a creation of sol (solid particles in a solution)
M¡OR C H2O ! M¡OH C ROH

ð2Þ

PThe second step involves condensation and gelation of the sol
due to polycondensation reactions. This results in a dramatic
increase in the viscosity of the solution.

M¡OH C RO¡M ! M¡O¡M C ROH
M¡OH C HO¡M ! M¡O¡M C H2O

ð3Þ

PThe gel is a rigid three-dimensional network of polymeric mole-
cules surrounded by the solvent. Polycondensation reactions con-
tinue until the gel
is completely formed. The gel structure is
reinforced by contraction of the gel matrix and expulsion of the solu-
tion. The gel is then dried by removing liquids and it is converted
into a micro-porous structure. Calcination is performed to dehydrate
the gel and form crystalline metal oxide nanoparticles. One of the
main advantages of the sol-gel method is the high purity and uni-
form nanostructure achievable at low temperatures [166].

POther important wet chemistry approaches are micro-emulsion
[167(cid:1)170], microwave-assisted wet-chemistry [171], and sono-
chemical methods [155,160,172,173]. Micro-emulsions involve ther-
modynamically stable isotropic dispersion of two immiscible liquids
consisting of nanosized domains of one liquid in the other, stabilized
by an interfacial film of surface active molecules [174]. Two different
micro-emulsions with reactants are forced together in a reactor, pro-
ducing mixing of reactants. Note that there is a limited amount of
reactant in each droplet [174,175]. As a result, the process has the
ability to restrict reactions to these “nanoreactors” of miscelles

P[174,175]. This process is by its nature capable of yielding fine and
monodispersed particles [175], and it is useful for large-scale pro-
duction of nanoparticles using relatively simple and inexpensive
hardware [176].

PIn sonochemical methods, ultrasonic waves are used in create
cavities in liquids [176]. The acoustic cavitation process generates a
transient localized hot zone with extremely high temperature and
pressure gradients [176]. Such changes in temperature and pressure
assist the destruction of the precursor and formation of nanopar-
ticles [176]. This technique can be used to produce large volumes of
materials for industrial applications [176]. Aluminum nanoparticles
capped with an organic shell have been synthesized using sono-
chemical-assisted thermal decomposition of alane adduct species
[160]. Alane adduct and titanium isopropoxide catalyst were first
added to a solution of dodecane and oleic acid. The solution was
transferred to a sonication flask and placed in a nitrogen-filled glove
bag encompassing the sonication instrument. The instrument con-
sisted of a solid titanium horn operated at 20 kHz. The solution was
sonicated for 7.5 min at an amplitude of 37%. The bulk reaction solu-
tion reached a maximum temperature of 70 °C and produced a black
solution that precipitated, yielding grayish-black powder. The pow-
der was recovered by evaporating the solvent under vacuum, and
washing repeatedly with hexane. The powder consisted of particles
with average sizes of either 5 or 30 nm, capped with an organic shell.
Green chemistry methods have also been recently considered to
minimize waste and utilize environmentally benign solvents and
renewable materials [177].

2.5. Mechanical attrition

PMechanical attrition, one of the oldest and simplest methods
available, is a top-down approach to the synthesis of nanomaterials
[178]. Nanoparticles are formed in a mechanical device, generally
known as mill, in which energy is imparted to feedstock to effect a
reduction in particle size. The resulting powders may consist of par-
ticles of diameters less than 100 nm. In certain cases, the crystallite
(grain) size after milling is between 1 and 10 nm. Such materials are
called nanocrystalline materials. Fig. 11 shows a schematic of an
attrition ball mill [179]. The powder is placed in a stationary tank
with the grinding medium. The feedstock particles, agitated by the
shaft rotating at a high speed, are crushed during media-media and
media-wall collisions. Brittle materials tend to fracture under
mechanical stress, whereas ductile and malleable materials can

Pundergo plastic deformation. The kinetics of the milling process
depends on the amount of energy transferred from the grinding
medium to the powder. Dense materials such as steel and tungsten
carbide are preferred for the grinding media [180]. Size reduction by
fracturing is counteracted by cold welding, which tends to result in
particle aggregation and fusion. Nanocrystalline aluminum powders
have been synthesized by milling of micron-sized aluminum par-
ticles in oxygen, hydrogen, and argon environments using hardened
steel balls [181]. The grain size and composition was dependent on
the milling time and ambient gas. Longer milling times resulted in
finer grains. Note, however, that prolonged milling may abrade the
grinding medium and contaminate particles.

PNanoparticles typically form agglomerates during the gas-phase
milling process, although particle agglomeration can be minimized
by conducting the milling in a liquid medium [179]. Air-stable boron
nanoparticles have been synthesized using high-energy ball milling
in a liquid medium [182]. Commercial boron particles of diameter
800 nm were employed as feedstock. Milling was carried using a
tungsten carbide milling jar and 1/8 inch diameter balls. About 2 g of
boron was milled with »15 mL of hexane added to prevent caking,
thereby reducing the milling time. To generate ligand-protected
boron nanoparticles, 1 mL of oleic acid was added to the boron/hex-
ane mixture prior to milling. Milling was performed in a nitrogen
environment. After milling, all samples were slowly brought into
contact with oxygen. Prior to analysis, excess oleic acid was
removed, although the ligand coating on the particles was preserved.
The washed particles were readily dispersed in hexane or other
hydrocarbon by ultrasonication, with mild centrifugation to remove
any remaining aggregates. The particle size distribution was very
narrow; the peak size was »43 nm and no particles were detected
outside the range of 35(cid:1)60 nm. Furthermore, x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) suggested complete protection against oxidation
in air for ligand-coated particles.

PConventional mechanical milling is not always very efficient for
ductile and malleable materials, since particles are not readily frac-
tured and cold welding is quite efficient [183]. In the reactant-
assisted mechanochemical method [183], liquid reagents are used to
enhance reactions and improve milling efficiency. Reactant-assisted
milling has been used to generate nanoparticles of aluminum, iron,
and copper in a number of reagents/solvents [183]. Improved nano-
particle production using the reactant-assisted mechanochemical
method has been attributed to binding of reagent/solvent on the
metal surface, which lowers the surface free energy as cracks propa-
gate and reducing cold welding [183]. The size distribution of par-
ticles has been attributed to the balance between wear processes
that spall or abrade particles from media surfaces, and cold welding,
which tends to build up larger particles and reattach particles to the
media surfaces. Particle size reduction can also be achieved in reac-
tive gases, as surface functionalization reduces surface free energy
and tendency towards cold welding [184].

2.6. Cluster synthesis

PAlthough metal particles have high energy densities, their rate of
energy release is lower than in monomolecular energetic materials.
The reactivity of metal particles can be enhanced by decreasing the
particle size to nanometer scale, but nanoparticles are easily oxi-
dized, due to their high specific surface area. An ideal metal-based
energetic material consists of uniformly dispersed, extremely small,
unoxidized metal clusters. Clusters are also of great interest to nano-
energetics as they provide a platform for the synthesis of novel ener-
getic nanomaterials [185]. Clusters offer the exciting prospect of
serving as building blocks for the “bottom-up” synthesis of new
materials, whose desired properties may be tailored through the
selection of size and composition.

PThe reactivity of clusters depends strongly on size [186]. For
example, aluminum cluster anions containing 13, 23, and 27 atoms
are unreactive in oxygen, while most other clusters are reactive
[186]. This phenomenon is attributed to the differences in the elec-
tron shell configurations of clusters. Clusters with closed shells are
typically stable, as predicted by the jellium shell model [187]. Note
that cluster properties can be tuned by the addition or removal of
one or more atoms [188]. For example, replacing an Al atom in the
Al13 cluster with a carbon atom leads to 40 electrons and a closed
shell, thereby resulting in a stable and inert cluster [188].

PClusters could also be designed to have the desired properties of
one or more of the elements in the periodic table [185]. The elec-
tronic structure of the Al13 cluster resembles that of a halogen atom,
so it was speculated that the Al13 cluster has properties similar to
those of a halogen atom. This hypothesis was supported by theoreti-
cal calculations, which suggested that electron affinities of the Al13
cluster and chlorine atom are similar [188]. The Al13 cluster is thus
referred to as “superhalogen” [185]. Experimental evidence came
from chemical reaction studies of halogenated aluminum clusters
[189,190].

PIt is apparent that clusters could mimic one or more properties of
a different element in the periodic table, and they are typically
regarded as “super atoms” [185]. This gave rise to the concept of a
three-dimensional periodic table of cluster elements, and the pros-
pect of using clusters as the building blocks of new nanoscale mate-
rials with tailored properties [185]. The approach involves three
synergistic steps: (1) identification of the potential building blocks
through experiments on size-selected clusters in the gas phase; (2)
investigation of the energetic and chemical stability of the cluster
motifs through compositional energy diagrams based on first-princi-
ple based theoretical investigations. This information, along with
experiments in step 1, enables identification of feasible units and
pathways to their assembly; (3) synthetic chemical approaches
designed to assemble desired cluster blocks using the information
derived in previous steps, or cluster assembly via direct deposition
[185]. The major difficulty in forming cluster-assembled materials is
that clusters are generally metastable and in many cases have a ten-
dency to coalesce [185]. The clusters must be isolated by passivation
with organic ligands, insertion into cages, or deposition on surfaces
[185].

PStable aluminum-based clusters have been synthesized from alu-
minum monohalides [191]. The equilibrium between liquid metal
and gaseous mono- and trihalides, in the case of the aluminum-chlo-
rine system, is given by [191]

ð4Þ

PEntropy arguments suggest that the equilibrium of the reaction
shifts in favor of the gaseous monochloride with increasing tempera-
ture and decreasing pressure [191]. To ensure ease of handling and a
continuous stream of aluminum monochloride (AlCl), a flow of
hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas over aluminum is normally used [191].
Fig. 12 shows a schematic of the experimental setup used to produce
aluminum clusters [191]. At the center of the vacuum chamber
(pressure »0.1 mbar), there is a high-temperature reactor containing
molten aluminum in several graphite chambers heated to around
1000 °C. AlCl vapors are generated by the flow of HCl gas through
graphite chambers containing a pool of liquid aluminum. Under
these conditions, there is more than 20-fold excess of AlCl over AlCl3

3. Novel passivation materials

PMetal particles are covered by a passivating oxide layer, whose
thickness is in the nanometer range [7,8,27,198]. Passivation can
be carried out after the nascent metallic particles are synthesized.
The powder is typically placed in a constant-temperature box filled
with argon and air [68]. To facilitate controlled particle oxidation,
the concentration of air in the gas is taken to be small (< 0.1 vol.%).
Note that metal oxide is an inert material and it does not react with
oxidizing gas. As mentioned before, the presence of the oxide layer
substantially diminishes the energy content of the particles at nano-
scales. Alternative coating materials might enhance the energy con-
tent, improve reactivity, and/or reduce particle agglomeration [199].
For example, nickel coating reduces the agglomerate size in a com-
posite solid propellant environment by about 40% [199]. This may
be attributed to the reduction in ignition delay and temperature of
aluminum particles due to intermetallic reactions [200]. An ideal
coating material will maximize both energy content and shelf life,
while ensuring ease of ignition without affecting the sensitivity
characteristics. In the past, a variety of novel coating materials such
as metals and organic materials have been considered. These are
discussed below.

3.1. Metallic coatings

PMetals are attractive coating materials since they can enhance
the energy content of the particles. Aluminum particles passivated
with metallic coatings have been synthesized using the wet-chemis-
try method [28], electric explosion process [201], and electroplating
[202]. Foley et al. [28] synthesized nano-aluminum particles passiv-
ated with palladium, silver, gold, and nickel. The particle size was
roughly 150 nm. Nascent aluminum particles were first slurried
with dimethyl ether. In a separate flask, acetylacetonate of metals
was dissolved in dimethyl ether. The resulting solution was added to
the stirred aluminum slurry and allowed to react for 12 hours. The
powder was then allowed to settle and the solvent was decanted.
The resulting solid was washed with dimethyl ether and dried. The
powder was passivated in air and the resulting particles contained
both aluminum and transition metal oxides. Nickel was most
efficient in protecting the active aluminum content; nickel-coated
aluminum particles had about 4% more active aluminum than other
particles. It was reported that more enhancements are expected for
finer particles.

PNickel-coated aluminum nanoparticles have also been synthe-
sized by electric explosion of Al-Ni composite wires in an argon
environment [201]. The particle size was 237 nm. Results suggested
that the nickel-coated aluminum powder has no superior reactivity
properties compared to conventional aluminum powder. For exam-
ple, the onset temperature of oxidation was about 565 °C, compara-
ble to that of conventional Al powder. Furthermore, the active
aluminum content of the powder was only 53%. Note that electric
explosion did not allow for precise control of particle size and
resulted in the formation of coarse and fine particles. Boron-coated
aluminum powders were also synthesized in the study. The alumi-
num content of boron-coated aluminum powder was comparable to
that of alumina-coated aluminum powder [201]. The combustion
enthalpy, however, increased from 5465 to 6232 kJ/kg, when the
boron coating was substituted for the alumina counterpart. This is
attributed to the high energy density of boron particles. From an
energy perspective, boron-coated aluminum particles are thus
attractive for propulsion and energy-conversion applications.

Pthe monohalide is usually obtained, which can stored at tempera-
tures of ¡78 °C for several months. The solubilized metastable
monohalide subsequently disproportionates, according to Eq, 4, in
the temperature range of ¡40 to 50 °C.

PThe resulting yellow crystals of (h5-pentamethylcyclopenta-
dienyl)-aluminum (I), referred to as Al4Cp*4, was the first Al(I) com-
pound that was stable under normal conditions. The energetics of
tetrameric aluminum (I) compound has been investigated using dif-
ferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analy-
sis (TGA) [193]. The DSC trace suggested an exotherm at 117 °C
followed by a steady rising exotherm, indicating good reactivity as
compared with micron and nano-aluminum powders. This was
attributed to combustion of Cp* ligands, followed by slow combus-
tion of aluminum. Note that the initial decomposition temperature
of 117 °C is also lower than that of currently available CHNP explo-
sives, PETN (163 °C). The material, however, was not air stable
enough to be considered as a replacement for aluminum particles.
The enthalpy of combustion was 11.5 kcal/cm3, about 60% of that of
pure aluminum. A similar approach can be used to synthesize other
metalloid clusters, such as the Al77 cluster, which is stabilized by
20 organic ligands [194].

POther cluster materials of concern are nickel-aluminum [193],
aluminum hydride [195], boron-aluminum hydride [196], and mag-
nesium-aluminum [197] clusters. Such clusters have been synthe-
sized using the pulsed arc cluster ionization source (PACIS) process
[195]. A discharge was triggered between a copper anode and a sam-
ple cathode and the sample was vaporized. Hydrogen gas was back-
filled into the discharging region, where the hydrogen gas partially
dissociated and aluminum and/or boron vaporized. Helium gas
flushed the plasma mix down a flow tube, where it reacted, cooled,
and formed clusters. Future studies must attempt to produce stable

3.2. Organic material coatings

POrganic materials are attractive candidate materials for passiv-
ation, as they can burn in many practical oxidizing environments
and contribute to the overall energy release. Furthermore, they typi-
cally react and decompose at lower temperatures, thereby enhanc-
ing the reactivity of metal nanoparticles [203]. Another advantage of
organic coatings is that they result in better processability of pow-
ders [204]. The extremely high surface area of Al nanopowders poses
many processing difficulties in solid propellants, as the binder and
plasticizer become incapable of wetting all of the solids. In this
regard, organic-coated Al nanopowders show better compatibility
than inorganic-coated Al nanopowders [204].

PAluminum nanoparticles passivated with carbon have been
synthesized using both laser heating/ablation [205,203] and arc dis-
charge [205,110]. Park et al. [205], for example, produced carbon-
coated particles using the laser ablation or DC-arc discharge meth-
ods in an argon-ethylene gas flow. The particle size was about 80 nm
and the thickness of the carbon coating was 1(cid:1)3 nm. Fig. 13 shows
TEM images of carbon-coated aluminum nanopowders [205].
The coating was found to be stable at temperatures lower than
700 °C and oxidized at about 800 °C. The latter value corresponds
roughly to the oxidation temperature of carbon (or soot) particles.
Carbon-coated aluminum particles were also synthesized by Ermoline
et al. [110] using the microarc discharge process. A very narrow size

cal Society).

Pdistribution was obtained; the geometrical mean size was 22.7 nm
and standard deviation was 1.35 nm. Another important achievement
was that the thickness of carbon coating was only »1 nm.

PGuo et al. [203] synthesized carbon-coated nanoaluminum par-
ticles by laser heating bulk aluminum and introducing methane gas
into the chamber. The particle size was in the range of 28(cid:1)50 nm.
Results of thermal analysis revealed that the carbon-coated aluminum
powder has a lower oxidation onset temperature (495 °C) and a lower
peak temperature (556 °C), where the maximum exotherm occurs,
compared to the conventional nanoaluminum powder. Furthermore,
the enthalpy change of carbon-coated aluminum powder was 3.54 J/g,
greater than that of conventional powder (2.76 J/g). These studies sug-
gest that carbon coating is an effective route to increase the reactivity
and energy-content of aluminum nanoparticles.

PMore complex organic compounds, such as perflouroalkyl car-
boxylic acids have also been considered [29]. Carboxylic acids, in
general, are known to have strong affinity to aluminum metal surfa-
ces [152]. A major advantage of fluorine-based passivation agents is
the high enthalpy of aluminum-fluorine reaction; the adiabatic
flame temperature is about 4400 K, greater than the counterpart in
the aluminum-oxygen system (4000 K). Aluminum powders coated
with perflouroalkyl compounds were synthesized using the wet-
chemistry method [29]. A diethyl ether (DEE) solution of an alane
adduct species was stirred in an argon-filled glove box. Titanium iso-
propoxide solution was added rapidly using a syringe and stirred for
five minutes. A solution of perflouroalkyl carboxylic acid in diethyl
ether was then added drop-wise to the reaction flask. The resulting
solid material was washed in diethyl ether and dried. Fig. 13b shows
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of nano-aluminum
particles passivated with perflouroalkyl carboxylic acid [29]. The
core size was estimated to be »5 nm, so the active aluminum con-
tent was only 15.4% by mass. Attempts to control particle size by
varying temperature, catalyst/alane ratio, and other methods were
unsuccessful. Furthermore, reduction of the amount of carboxylic
acid resulted in an extremely pyrophoric material. Further improve-
ments in the passivation process will be necessary to synthesize
larger particles with greater active aluminum content.

PIn a more recent study [152], two different alanes (H3AlN
[(CH3)2C2H5] and H3AlN[(C4H8)(CH3)]) and a number of passivation
agents were considered. Results suggested that non-fluorinated car-
boxylic acid was less effective than fluorinated counterparts in pro-
tecting aluminum particles from surface oxidation. The passivation
agent plays the dual roles of trapping aluminum particles to keep
them nanoscale during the alane decomposition and protecting the
aluminum nanoparticles postproduction from surface oxidation
[152]. An appropriate balance between the rate of alane decomposi-
tion and the timing in the introduction of the passivation agent into
the reaction mixture is critical to obtain the desired product mixes
and/or morphologies [152]. Further information on the rates of alane
decomposition reactions could be valuable to the controlled and pre-
dictable production of stable and dispersed aluminum nanoparticles.
POther organic passivating materials such as oleic and stearic acids
have also been considered [201,160,161,173]. For oleaic acids, stud-
ies suggest that the organic layer was transparent to oxygen gas, so
that an internal oxide layer was able to form, as shown in Fig. 14
[201]. The active aluminum content in the powder was thus as low
as 45%. A similar observation was made by Fernando et al. [160] for
nanoaluminum particles passivated by oleic acid. The organic layer
acted as an oxygen source for the oxidation and passivation of alu-
minum. About 40% of the sample mass was active aluminum, 35%
was organic coating, and 25% was organic-provided aluminum oxide
layer. Alternative capping materials such as alkyl-substituted epox-
ides have also been considered [159,206]. Particles with diameters
on the order of 20 nm are produced. The epoxide reagent polymer-
ized on the particle surface to produce polyether. Although the
organic layer is oxygen rich, the produced nanoparticles had low

4.1. Melting temperature

PMelting temperature is of primary concern in any consideration
of the ignition and combustion of metal-based energetic nanomate-
rials For example, it is proposed that melting of the aluminum core
and oxide layer plays an important role in the ignition of aluminum
nanoparticles [15,207]. Melting also promotes reactivity of thermite
[208] and inter-metallic systems [200]. As a result, understanding
the melting behavior of metal nanoparticles is of paramount impor-
tance. Table 1 shows the melting temperatures of bulk metals and
their oxides. Metals typically melt at temperatures lower than those
of their respective oxides. An exception is boron; the melting point
of boron is 2349 K, significantly greater than that of boron trioxide
(723 K).

PThe melting temperatures of nanoparticles can be calculated
using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is, however, impor-
tant to first determine if the potential function can accurately pre-
dict the melting temperatures of the bulk. An unrealistic potential
function often leads to erroneous predictions. Bulk materials can be
modeled by imposing periodic boundary conditions in all three spa-
tial directions. Fig. 15 shows variations of the thermodynamic and
structural properties of bulk aluminum with temperature. Atomic
interactions are captured using an embedded atom potential in
order to treat the physics of metallic bonding. Melting is observed at
a temperature of 1250 K, at which point sharp variations occur in
the potential energy and translational-order parameter. Note that
the temperature at which melting occurs is about 18% greater than
the experimental value, due to the absence of nucleation sites [209].
To facilitate better agreement with experimental data, free-surface
boundary conditions can be imposed in one of the directions [210].
For example, this approach was adopted to calculate the melting
temperature of bulk alumina using a three-body interatomic poten-

Poxide content. The active aluminum content was 96%, substantially
higher than that of conventional aluminum powder of same size
(31%).

PNano-aluminum particles have also been passivated with
hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) [204], which is typi-
cally used as a binder in solid rocket propellant because of its
very low glass transition temperature, low viscosity and high com-
bustion enthalpy. The powder was stored for 2 years in an ambi-
ent environment and then tested. The DSC signal of HTPB-coated
powder attained its peak value at a relatively low temperature of
554 °C. Furthermore, the enthalpy change was 3.87 kJ/g, greater
than that of conventional powder. These studies demonstrate the
multiple benefits of using organic materials to passivate aluminum
nanopowder.

PStudies on novel passivation materials for other metallic particles
are limited. Nano-boron particles have been passivated with bro-
mine and fluorine in an attempt to increase the combustion effi-
ciency [9]. Boron nanoparticles were first produced by gas phase
pyrolysis of decaborane (B10H14). The particle size was 10(cid:1)150 nm.
The nascent boron particles were then treated with bromine and
XeF2 to obtain boron particles passivated with bromine and fluorine,
respectively. The combustion efficiency of fluorine-coated boron
particles was reported to be »75%, greater than that of conventional
boron particles (»50%) [10]. Oleic acid has also been used to passiv-
ate boron nanoparticles [182].

4. Physicochemical properties

PAs mentioned in Section 1, the properties of nanoparticles are
size dependent and differ substantially from those of bulk materials,
owing to the high specific surface area and excess energy of surface
atoms. This applies to a variety of properties, such as melting and
boiling points, enthalpy of combustion, emissivity, and so forth. For
certain properties in some materials, deviations from bulk value
become substantial for particles smaller than 10 nm, but for others,
deviations are not negligible even for particle sizes as high as
100 nm. In any case, the properties of bulk materials cannot always
be used to accurately predict the ignition and combustion behaviors
of nanoparticles. As a result, experimental and numerical analyses
are required to determine the unique properties of nanoparticles. In
this section, the size dependence of nanoparticle properties is
described and the underlying processes and mechanisms are dis-
cussed.

Ptial [210]. When periodic boundary conditions were imposed in all
three directions, the crystal melted at 2700 K, which is substantially
greater than the experimental value of 2350 K. Melting occurred at
2500 K when a free-surface boundary condition was imposed along
the (001) crystallographic direction.

PMelting temperatures and enthalpy of melting of nanoparticles
are substantially lower than those of bulk materials. Most of the
studies have considered aluminum and more studies on melting of
nanoparticles of other energetic materials are needed. Fig. 16 shows
the effect of particle size on the melting temperature and enthalpy
of melting of aluminum particles [211]. Results of MD simulations
[21,211,212] and, experimental [181,213] and theoretical studies
[214] are shown. At melting point, equilibrium persists between the
solid and liquid phases of the material. For temperatures greater
than the melting point, the Gibbs free energy of the liquid phase is
lower than that of the solid phase, and a spontaneous phase trans-
formation is triggered. The excess energy of surface atoms alters the
Gibbs free energy and reduces the melting temperature. As the frac-
tion of surface atoms in the particle is a function of particle size,
melting temperature is a size-dependent property. Note that the
melting temperature of aluminum particles is as low as 473 K at a
particle size of 2 nm. For smaller particles, melting was characterized
by fluctuations in the potential energy, a phenomenon referred to as
dynamic melting [215]. The particle oscillates between liquid and
solid phases over a temperature range of 450(cid:1)475 K.

PThe melting point depression can be calculated using the Gibbs(cid:1)
Thompson equation [214], which addresses the effect of interfacial
energy on equilibrium properties. The size-dependence of melting

decreases from 10.43 to 1.69 kJ/mol, when the particle size decreases
from 40 to 13 nm. Predictions are in reasonably good agreement
with experimental data [181]. An equation for the size dependence

PPredictions from the MD simulations differ from the experimen-
tal data. A number of factors may account for these discrepancies. In
the experiments, particle melting was studied using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thin-film DSC apparatus, with heat-
ing rates on the order of 1 and 105 K/s, respectively [181,213]. These
are orders of magnitude lower than the heating rate employed in
the MD simulations (»1013 K/s). Note that the Gibbs-Thompson the-
ory corresponds to equilibrium melting point, while ultrafast heat-
ing typically results in non-equilibrium conditions. Furthermore,
experiments considered passivated particles, whereas the MD simu-
lations dealt with nascent particles. The melting temperatures of
passivated particles could be different from those of their nascent
counterparts due to pressure buildup and epitaxial interfacial struc-
ture [222]. Note finally that the measured melting temperatures of
Eckert et al. [181] and Lai et al. [213] are not the same, perhaps
because of differences in the heating rate and/or the powder synthe-
sis method. Lai et al.’s particles were prepared using the gas-phase
condensation method, whereas Eckert et al. employed the mechani-
cal attrition technique. In the following sections, an attempt is made
to elucidate the effects of heating rate, defects, and particle encapsu-
lation on the melting of metal particles.

P4.1.1. Effect of heating rate

PHeating rate is an important parameter that affects melting
dynamics. Melting temperature is typically measured using differen-
tial scanning calorimetry or laser heating methods. In conventional
DSC studies, the heating rate is on the order of 1 K/s [223]. Heating
rates of »105 K/s can be achieved using a thin film differential scan-
ning nano-calorimeter [213]. Other techniques that are associated
with high heating rates include laser and shock heating [224]. In
molecular dynamics simulations, the particle is heated at a rate of
1013 K/s, orders of magnitude greater than those in most practical
systems. As a result, the effect of heating rate on the melting dynam-
ics of nanoparticles must be considered.

PThe effect of heating rate on melting has been recently studied
[222]. It is well known that in nanoparticles melting typically begins

Pat the free surface and the melting front propagates to the interior
regions of the core. This is referred to as heterogeneous melting.
Under some conditions, heterogeneous nucleation can be prevented
and melting occurs by catastrophic homogeneous melting of the
whole system [222]. This is the case for low-dimensional materials
and nanoparticles passivated by suitable high-melting point materi-
als in such a manner that interfacial nucleation is prevented. In these
cases, melting typically occurs at temperatures substantially greater
than the thermodynamic melting temperature and the phenomenon
is referred to as superheating. The degree of superheating is depen-
dent on heating rate and a maximum limit is believed to be about
20% for aluminum [222], which is consistent with MD simulation
results for surface-free bulk aluminum [212].

PLuo and Ahrens [225] conducted a systematic study to determine
the effect of heating rate on degree of superheating based on homo-
geneous nucleation theory. The steady-state nucleation rate is
expressed as follows [225]:

where M is a function of material properties (m) and temperature

energy for nucleation is expressed as [225]

tion of the energy barrier, b, which is a material-dependent

PAssuming that the probability x for a given amount of parent
phase containing new phase is the same for both undercooling and

PThe parameter A has values of 60 and 31 at heating rates of 1 and
1012 K/s, respectively. It represents the time scale characteristic of
nucleation at different heating rates. The degree of superheating
was found to increase with increasing heating rate, from »15% at
1 K/s to 20% at 1012 K/s. Note that these are within the maximum
superheating limits and agree with the MD simulation results at
comparable heating rates.

PAn important question is whether superheating is also of concern
for heterogeneous melting. For bare metal particles, there is no pas-
sivation layer that prevents heterogeneous melting of the particles.
Results of MD simulations do indicate that heating rate is of concern
to heterogeneous melting dynamics of metal particles. Fig. 17 shows
the potential energy of bare aluminum nanoparticles during melting
for different heating rates [212]. At a higher heating rate, melting
occurs over a broader range of temperatures. Note that the heating
rates considered are in the range of 1012(cid:1)1014 K/s, achievable in MD
simulations. A similar result was obtained by Shibuta and Suzuki
[226] for solidification of molybdenum particles. The particle size
was 6 nm and the number of atoms was 6750. Fig. 18(a) shows the

Pthe difference between offset and onset temperatures increases with
increasing cooling rate. More recent studies also indicate a pro-
nounced effect of heating rate on the melting of bare aluminum par-
ticles for heating rates greater than 1012 K/s, but negligible effect for
heating rates lower than 1011 K/s [221].

P4.1.2. Effect of defects

PParticles may have defects in the form of cracks, voids, and grain
boundaries and these could affect the melting temperature of nano-
particles [209]. For instance, defects such as voids and surfaces could
provide sites for nucleation of liquid phase. Puri and Yang [227] con-
ducted molecular dynamics simulations and investigated mecha-
nisms associated with defect nucleated melting. Fig. 19 shows the
temporal evolution of particle density during melting of a 5.5-nm
nascent aluminum particle with voids of different sizes [227]. For a
defect-free particle, melting begins at the outer surface and propa-
gates to interior regions of the particle. In a particle with a void, on
the other hand, melting occurs simultaneously at the void and parti-
cle surface. Note that a void size of 8.2 nm3 results in structural
instability and collapse of the crystal. Fig. 20 shows the effect of void
size on the melting temperature of a 5.5 nm nascent aluminum par-
ticle [227]. The melting temperature remains constant for void vol-
umes smaller than 1 nm3, but decreases with further increase in the
void volume. For void volumes exceeding 8 nm3, the particle is
unable to withstand the destabilizing forces associated with the void

ticle; MD simulations with glue potential (reprinted from [227] with permission of
Springer).

Pand the crystal collapses abruptly at 700 K. Voids could thus exert a
significant effect on melting dynamics of metal nanoparticles.

P4.1.3. Effect of passivation layer

PThe oxide layer covering metal nanoparticles could exert a signif-
icant effect on the melting point, so the predicted melting tempera-
tures of nascent metal nanoparticles cannot be compared with
experimental data, which are obtained for passivated nanoparticles.
The effect of oxide layer on the melting temperature of metal par-
ticles must therefore be understood. Puri and Yang [207] conducted
molecular dynamics simulations and calculated melting tempera-
tures of passivated nano-aluminum particles. Fig. 21 shows the
effect of particle size on the melting temperatures of aluminum core
and oxide shell [207]. The oxide layer thickness is 1 nm. The melting
temperature of the aluminum core increases with increasing core
diameter, from about 650 K at 5 nm to 900 K at 10 nm. These values
are approximately equal to melting temperatures of nascent alumi-
num particles predicted by MD simulations. These results suggest
that the oxide layer exerts a negligible effect on the melting temper-
ature of the aluminum core. Note, however, that the melting tem-
peratures of the oxide shell vary in the range of 950(cid:1)1200 K,
substantially lower than the bulk value of 2350 K. It is important to
also note that the Streitz(cid:1)Mintmire potential has not been shown to
reproduce melting temperatures of alumina, so the melting points
determined from these MD simulations may not be very accurate.

Ptemperatures of aluminum particles with undamaged oxide layers
are greater than those of particles with damaged oxide layers, per-
haps because of the buildup of compressive stresses in the alumi-
num core. This observation substantiates the theory that pressure
buildup could affect the melting temperature of the aluminum core.
PThe melting temperature and pressure buildup are related by the

where Dp is the pressure buildup and DT the melting temperature
difference. The subscripts s and l refer to solid and liquid, respec-
tively. For core pressures in the range of 0.1(cid:1)1 GPa, the melting tem-
perature difference varies between 10 and 100 K. Note that the
uncertainties associated with data points in Fig. 23 are not fully
known and differences in melting temperatures are not very sub-
stantial. Recent theoretical studies, however, do support the argu-
ment that the oxide layer exerts a significant pressure effect on
melting temperature of aluminum nanoparticles [221].

PThe interfacial structure is also of concern with respect to the
melting temperature of the core [222]. Fig. 24 shows the effect of
particle size on the melting temperature of indium particles [229].
Lead and indium nanoparticles embedded in an aluminum matrix
were synthesized using ball milling and melt spinning techniques
[230,231]. Particle diameters varied in the range of 5(cid:1)45 nm.
Melting behaviors were studied using differential scanning calo-
rimetry at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. An incoherent interface
was observed in the ball milled particles, whereas a semi-coherent
interface was present for melt-spun particles. For ball-milled sam-
ples, the melting temperature decreased with decreasing particle
size. An opposite trend was observed for melt-spun particles and
the temperatures were substantially greater than the bulk value
(156.6 °C). It can be concluded that the nature of the core-shell
interface has a tremendous impact on the melting temperature of
nanoparticles.

PThe interface also affects the nucleation process and melting
mechanism [222]. Molecular dynamics simulations of melting of
nickel-coated silver nanoparticles suggest that nucleation occurred
homogenously when there was no lattice mismatch [229]. If there
was lattice mismatch, nucleation occurred at the defective interfa-
cial region. A similar scenario was observed for nickel-coated nano-
aluminum particles [212]. Fig. 25 shows snapshots of an 8 nm
nickel-coated aluminum particle colored by thermal displacement
of atoms [212]. Nucleation occurs at the Al-Ni interface and the
melting front propagates to the interior regions of the particle.

ticles obtained using differential scanning calorimetry. Solid lines is the Gibbs(cid:1) Thomp-
son curve fit with solid-liquid surface tension of 68 mJ/m2, lower than 90(cid:1)150 mJ/m2
found in the literature (reprinted from [228] with permission of Elsevier).

PExperimental studies, on the other hand, suggest that the oxide
layer exerts a significant effect on the melting temperatures of alu-
minum particles [214,228]. Fig. 22 shows the effect of particle size
on the melting temperature of passivated aluminum particles (as
measured using DSC) [228]. The oxide layer thickness is in the range
of about 3(cid:1)5 nm. The solid line in the figure represents the fit to the
Gibbs-Thompson equation. As can be seen, the measured melting
temperatures are well represented by the curve-fit, but for a solid-
liquid interfacial energy of 68 mJ/m2,which is lower than the values
available in the literature (90(cid:1)150 mJ/m2) [228]. The disparity was
attributed to pressure buildup in the aluminum core due to the
cage-like effect imposed by the oxide shell. The buildup of pressure
results in elevated melting temperatures. When the melting temper-
atures were corrected to account for the pressure effect, the result-
ing solid-liquid interfacial energy was found to be 101 mJ/m2, which
is in better agreement with the data in the literature.

PIn another study [214], effect of oxide shell on melting point
depression of aluminum nanoparticles was studied by intentionally
damaging the oxide layers. The particle size varied in the range of
17 nm¡12 mm and the oxide layer thickness was in the range of
1.7(cid:1)4.1 nm. To create imperfections in the oxide layer, particles
were damaged mechanically by placing them between two cylindri-
cal pistons. A vertical load was applied to the powder with the single
acting cylinder of the press. Fig. 23 shows the melting temperatures
of passivated aluminum particles with damaged and undamaged
oxide layers [214]. Results appear to suggest that the melting

of the oxide shell as a function of shell thickness [232]. For a shell
thickness of 3(cid:1)5 nm, the melting temperature is lower than the bulk
value by 200(cid:1)400 K. MD simulations indicate a similar trend for
nickel and aluminum shells in Ni/Al core-shell structured particles,
as shown in Fig. 28 [211,212]. The melting temperature of the nickel
shell increases from 1325 K at 1 nm to 1580 K at 3 nm. Note that the
result obtained for planar thin films cannot be directly used for
spherical passivation layers over aluminum nanoparticles. Further

P4.1.4. Melting temperature of passivation layer

PThe melting temperature of the passivation layer plays an impor-
tant role in ignition and combustion of metal-based energetic
nanomaterials, including conventional [207] and Ni-coated Al nano-
particles [212]. In ignition analysis of aluminum particles [22,34],
particle ignition is associated with melting of the oxide layer, and
the corresponding melting point is taken to be the bulk melting tem-
perature of the oxide layer (»2350 K). It is well known that the
thickness of the passivation layer is typically in the nanometer range
and hence its melting point could be size dependent and lower than
the corresponding bulk value. The phenomenon of melting point
depression of nano-scale passivation layers may have important
implications for ignition temperatures and mechanisms.

PFig. 26 shows the effect of shell thickness on the melting temper-
atures of the aluminum core and alumina shell [207]. Results were
obtained using MD simulations. The melting temperature of the
oxide shell increases with increasing shell thickness, from about
the melting
1130 K at 0.5 nm to 1300 K at 2 nm. Note that

PEqs. (20)-(22) were solved iteratively to calculate boiling temper-
atures of aluminum particles as a function of the particle size. Fig. 29
shows the calculated boiling temperatures for three different pres-
sures, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 atm [22]. The boiling temperature is substan-
tially lower than the bulk value only for particle diameters lower
than 10 nm.

PThe effect of surface tension on the boiling temperature must also
be considered. Surface tension can increase the pressure inside the
particle, thereby elevating the boiling temperature. For a spherical
particle, the Laplace pressure, pL, is given by [235]
pL D pa C 2

where pa is the pressure of the ambient gas, in this case 1 bar. Fig. 30
shows the Laplace pressure and boiling temperature of aluminum as
a function of pressure for different particle sizes [235]. The boiling
temperature is the temperature corresponding to the point of inter-
section of the two curves. For example, the boiling temperature of a
100 nm Al particle is »3700 K, which is substantially greater than
the bulk value of 2740 K. Note that the Laplace pressure effect is
more significant than the size dependence described by Eqs. (20-22).
The net result is that the boiling temperatures of metal nanoparticles
are predicted to be substantially greater than those of the bulk mate-
rials. Note that this effect is important even for particles with diame-
ters on the order of 100 nm. This has important implications for the
combustion mode of metal nanoparticles; the high boiling point
implies that surface reactions could play a critical role during

Pnecessary to determine the effect of shell thickness and particle size
on melting point of the passivation layer covering spherical metal
nanoparticles. In any case, melting point depression of nano-scale
passivation layers must be given its due importance in the analysis
of ignition and combustion of metal particles.

4.2. Boiling temperature

PBoiling temperature is also important in the study of the combus-
tion of metal particles. Vapor-phase combustion can typically occur
when the adiabatic flame temperature is greater than the boiling
temperature of the particle. As a result, knowledge of metal boiling
points under different conditions is essential to ascertain the mode
of combustion. Boiling temperatures of metal nanoparticles that are
substantially different from those of the bulk materials could have
important implications on the possibility of vapor-phase combustion
for metal nanoparticles. Table 2 shows the boiling temperatures of
metals and their oxides at 1 atm pressure. The boiling temperatures
of metals are typically lower than those of their respective oxides.
Notable exceptions are boron, silicon, and zirconium.

PThe size dependence of the boiling temperature of aluminum
particles has been characterized by treating the size effect of vapor
pressure [22]. The vapor pressure of aluminum near the surface of a
spherical aluminum particle, pD, is given by [82]

4.3. Enthalpy of combustion

Fig. 31. Effect of particle size on enthalpy of combustion of aluminum particles
obtained using thermodynamic energy balance (adapted from [237] with permission
of Elsevier).

Penthalpy of combustion is greater than the bulk value. This is a
rather surprising effect of agglomeration for ultrafine particles.
Note that the deviations from the bulk value are substantially
only for particles smaller than 10 nm. It must be noted that the
above results are solely based on theoretical analysis. Experi-
mental studies will be necessary to verify the predicted size
dependence of enthalpy of combustion.

PThe enthalpy of combustion of aluminum particles is yet another
important property of concern. The aluminum-oxygen reaction is
given by
2Al C 1:5O2 ! Al2O3:

ð24Þ
PThe enthalpy of combustion of bulk aluminum in pure oxygen is
¡1675 kJ/mol [236]. The size dependence of enthalpy of combustion
of aluminum particles has been studied theoretically [237]. The anal-
ysis considered the size dependencies of the cohesive energy of alu-
minum and lattice energy of aluminum oxide. Two different cases
were considered. In the first case, aluminum nanoparticles react to
form aluminum oxide nanoparticles, whereas in the second case, alu-
minum nanoparticles react to form oxide agglomerates. For the first
case, the thermodynamic energy balance can be written as [237]:
DHR;1 D DHR;bulk
;
ð25Þ
where DLEOX is the difference between the lattice energies of bulk
and nano-alumina, while DCEAl the difference between the cohesive
energies of bulk and nano aluminum. For the second case, the energy
balance is given by [237]

PFig. 31 shows the effect of particle size on enthalpy of combustion
of aluminum particles [237]. For isolated particles, the enthalpy of
combustion decreases with decreasing particle size. Predictions can

bustion of isolated aluminum particles in oxygen [22]

where HR is the heat of reaction in kJ/mol and Dp the particle
size in nm. The observed size dependence of the combustion
enthalpy is due to the fact that the particle size exerts a stronger
effect on the lattice energy of alumina than on the cohesive
energy of aluminum [237]. When particle agglomeration is con-
sidered, the lattice energy of alumina can be taken to be approxi-
mately equal to the corresponding bulk value [237]. As a result,
reactions are more exothermic for smaller particles and the

4.4. Emissivity

PTo model ignition and combustion of metal particles, radiation
heat transfer between particles and ambient gas must be accounted
for. In most of the previous studies on aluminum combustion, radia-
tion heat transfer between metal nanoparticles and ambient gases
has been modeled using the Stefan-Boltzmann law [236]

constant and its value is chosen to be on the order of 0.1 [34]. For
nanoparticles, the particle size is lower than the wavelength of ther-
mal radiation and the particle emissivity is significantly lower than
the bulk value [238].

Pto particle concentration at high temperatures. Efforts were made to
measure emissivity of alumina nanoparticles at even lower tempera-
tures. The exponent n decreased from ¡1.446 at 2368 K to ¡2.449 at
1801 K. This was attributed to the melting of the oxide layer at
2300 K. In general, optical depth had a significant effect on the wave-
length dependence of emissivity of micron-sized alumina particles,
while a relatively weak effect was observed with more spread for
nanoparticles.

PIt is apparent that emissivity is dependent on various factors,
including particle size, temperature, wavelength, and phase of the
material. These can be considered to treat radiation heat transfer
between metal nanoparticles and ambient gases more accurately.
Also, the application of the classical Stefan-Boltzmann law with a
constant emissivity value corresponding to the bulk material may
lead to significant errors. Further studies will be necessary to fully
understand the dependence of emissivity and absorptivity on particle
size, wavelength, and temperature over a broad range of conditions.

5. Low-temperature oxidation of metal nanoparticles

PLow temperature oxidation of metals has been the subject of
research since the early 1900 s. Here, temperatures of concern are
significantly lower than the ignition temperature of particles.
Although these reactions and mechanisms may influence the overall
ignition delay, they are not responsible for particle ignition. They
may, however, have important implications for the shelf life and
safety characteristics of particles. Oxidation of nascent particles
involves formation and growth of a monomolecular oxide layer. For
passivated particles, oxidation results in the growth of the existing
oxide layer. In general, the mechanism of low temperature oxidation
of metal nanoparticles depends on the particle temperature and the
properties of the metal and oxide layer. The formation of the oxide
monolayer is a quick process; however, the mechanistic details are
not well understood. The oxidizer molecules diffuse and collide and
adsorb on the particle surface. Once the oxide monolayer is estab-
lished, the growth rate is largely dependent on the properties of the
oxide layer and temperature.

PTable 3 lists some important low temperature oxidation mecha-
nisms. The linear oxidation law means that the oxide layer thickness
grows linearly with time. This implies that the growth rate of the
oxide layer is constant and the newly established oxide layer does
not affect the growth rate. This is typically the case for particles with
porous and/or cracked oxide layers [242]. In such cases, chemical
kinetics controls the rate of oxidation of particles. The logarithmic
law is typically applicable for low temperatures and thin intact oxide
layers [243,244]. Here, the oxide layer thickness is a logarithmic
function of time. Mass diffusion across the oxide layer is the rate-
controlling process and the major driving force is the electric field
across the oxide layer [245]. For thicker oxide layers and higher tem-
peratures, particle oxidation may follow the parabolic law [103,243].
In this case, the major driving force for mass diffusion is the presence
of concentration gradients. In the following sections, mechanisms
governing oxidation of metals and kinetics of oxidation under differ-
ent conditions are discussed in detail.

Fig. 32. Effect of particle size on emissivity of aluminum nanoparticles; analysis con-
sidered magnetic-dipole contribution but ignored electric dipole contribution, which
is important at high temperatures (reprinted from [22] with permission of Elsevier).

PFig. 32 shows the effect of particle size on the emissivity of alumi-
num particles for different temperatures [22]. The particle emissivity
is orders of magnitude lower than the bulk value; for a particle size
of 20 nm and temperature of 300 K, the emissivity is »10-4, substan-
tially lower than the bulk value of 0.02. Furthermore, emissivity is a
strong function of temperature. It is important to note that the mag-
netic dipole approximation is strictly valid only for far-infrared and
longer wavelengths (corresponding to low temperatures). In practi-
cal combustion systems, the temperature range of concern is as high
as 3000 K. As a result, the electric dipole contribution must be
treated. When electric and magnetic dipole contributions are consid-
ered, at a fixed temperature, the emissivity attains its maximum
value when the particle radius is 1/2p times the wavelength of the
peak thermal radiation as given by Wien’s law [239]. This suggests
that there is non-monotonic reduction in emissivity with decreasing
particle size, contradicting the predictions of the magnetic dipole
theory.

PExperimental studies have also been conducted to measure the
emissivity of alumina particles, and these experiments have shed
some light on the spectral nature of emissivity and effects of temper-
ature and optical depth of dust clouds. Lynch et al. [240] conducted
heterogeneous shock tube experiments to measure the emissivity of
alumina particles in an inert environment as a function of tempera-
ture (2000(cid:1)3500 K), wavelength (0.55(cid:1)0.95 mm), and particle diam-
eter (50 nm(cid:1)10 mm). The dependence of spectral emissivity on
wavelength was expressed in the following form: eλ D a λn, where
the exponent, n, was a function of temperature. For micro-sized alu-
mina particles, emissivity decreased with increasing wavelength at
low temperatures, but followed an opposite trend at higher temper-
atures. The exponent n thus increased from ¡1.4 to 0.5, when tem-
perature increased from 2500 to 3500 K. A roughly gray behavior
was observed at about 3000 K. For alumina nanoparticles, emissivity
exhibited a stronger spectral dependence. At 2678 K, n was approxi-
mately ¡1.2 but reached as high as 2.1 at 3052 K. For both cases, the
emissivity was a strongly dependent on temperature.

PIn a subsequent study [241], measurements were made using the
same shock tube setup, but for optically thin alumina particle clouds,
and focusing on the effects of temperature and wavelength on emis-
sivity. The emissivity was found to be weakly dependent on temper-
ature over the temperature range of 2700(cid:1)3500 K. The exponent in
the emissivity-wavelength relationship was ¡1.4 and ¡1.2 for
micro- and nano-alumina particles, respectively. This is not in agree-
ment with the results obtained in the previous study [240]. The dis-
parity was attributed to the sensitivity of optical depth of the cloud

5.1. Planar substrates

PThe oxidation of bare metallic substrates at near room temperature
was first studied by Cabrera and Mott [245]. An initial fast oxidation
stage, in which the oxide layer forms and grows rapidly, is followed by
an abrupt and drastic reduction of the growth rate. They advanced a
theory of low temperature oxidation of metals with passivated surfa-
ces. The Cabrera-Mott theory corresponds to the logarithmic growth
rate law. Fig. 33 shows a schematic of the electric field across the oxide
layer of the particle, illustrating the Cabrera-Mott oxidation mecha-
nism [22]. The oxidizer gas molecules are adsorbed on the particle sur-
face. The metal electrons traverse through the oxide layer to ionize the
adsorbed oxidizer atoms, creating an electric field between the metal-
oxide and oxide-oxidizer interfaces. The presence of the electric field
promotes mass diffusion across the oxide layer. The growth of the
oxide layer on a planar substrate is given by [245]

oxide layer growth weakens the electric field and the growth rate
slows down. The Mott(cid:1)Cabrera model thus corresponds to the loga-
rithmic growth rate law.

PJeurgens et al. [246] systematically studied the oxidation mecha-
nism of pure aluminum substrates. The substrates were heated to
temperatures in the range of 373(cid:1)773 K and exposed to pure oxygen
gas at a partial pressure of 1.33 £ 10-4 Pa. Exposure times varied in
the range of 100(cid:1)15,000 s. Fig. 34 shows the temporal evolution of
the oxide layer thickness for different substrate temperatures. For
temperatures up to 573 K, the oxide layer thickness attains a limiting
value. This is consistent with the findings of Cabrera and Mott [245].
At higher temperatures, the growth of the oxide layer is not arrested
and a limiting thickness is not attained. The initial fast oxidation pro-
cess was attributed to electric-field controlled interstitial outward
diffusion of Al cations. At the end of the initial fast oxidation stage,
the electron tunnel current became effectively zero. As a result of

pure aluminum substrates for different temperatures (reprinted from [246] with per-
mission of American Institute of Physics).

Pthe constraint of coupled currents of electrons and cations, oxide-
film growth stops at low temperatures, because the chemical diffu-
sion of ions across the oxide layer and the contribution of electron
transport by thermionic emission are negligibly small. During the
slow oxidation stage, the initially Al-enriched, amorphous oxide film
attained the stoichiometric composition and became crystalline
g-Al2O3. As soon as g-Al2O3 crystallites formed, the inward chemical
diffusion of oxygen along grain boundaries established the
growth of the oxide layer. The Mott potential and energy barrier
were calculated for the limiting oxide layer thickness condition
(dd/dt D 10-15 m/s) [246]. Parameters can also be calculated by inte-
grating the Cabrera(cid:1)Mott equation and plotting the inverse of the
oxide layer thickness as a function of log (t/d2) [247,248]. The result-
ing slope and intercept can be used to obtain the values of the Mott
potential, energy barrier, and number of cations per unit area jump-
ing across the interface.

PFor thicker oxide layers and higher temperatures, experimental
evidence suggests that oxidation may no longer follow the logarith-
mic law [243]. The oxidation of single aluminum crystals has been
studied for temperatures as high as 800 K using ellipsometry [243].
The pressure was varied between 10-9 and 10-2 torr. The initial fast
oxidation stage involved chemisorption of oxygen molecules on the
particle surface and formation of a thin oxide layer. This was fol-
lowed by a slow oxidation stage, corresponding to the growth of the
oxide layer. The oxidation kinetics followed the logarithmic law over
a temperature range of 500(cid:1)600 K, but a parabolic law was observed
at higher temperatures (650(cid:1)800 K). As mentioned earlier, in the
parabolic regime, the oxidation rate is governed by mass diffusion
through the oxide layer and the driving force is the presence of con-
centration gradients (Fickian diffusion). The resulting oxide growth
rate can be expressed as:

dd

fusion and J is the Fickian diffusion flux, which is given by:

where D is the diffusion coefficient, DC is the difference between

oxide growth rate can be written as:

5.2. Metal nanoparticles

PThe Mott(cid:1)Cabrera equation, as discussed in the previous section,
is applicable only for planar substrates. For spherical particles,
appropriate corrections must be incorporated. For example, the elec-
tric field across the oxide layers of a nanoparticle is greater than its
counterpart in a planar substrate [249], so the model must incorpo-
rate the electric field correction and volume changes associated with
particle oxidation [250]. The following equations have been devel-
oped to characterize the oxidation rate of metal nano-particles
[250]:

where Rc is the core radius. Table 4 lists the model constants for alu-
minum [250]. Such models can be used to simulate oxidation of pas-
sivated metal nanoparticles [251,252]. Caution must, however, be
exercised when using these models, as particle oxidation may not
always be governed by Mott(cid:1)Cabrera kinetics over the entire range
of conditions.

PMolecular dynamics simulations also indicate a two-stage oxide
layer growth process for aluminum nanoparticles [32,253]. A 20 nm
aluminum particle was placed at the center of an 80 nm long cubic
box. A total of 530,720 oxygen atoms were distributed randomly in
the box. The temperature of the system was 300 K. Inter-atomic inter-
actions were captured using the Streitz(cid:1)Mintmire potential. Fig. 35
shows a snapshot of the dissected particle and the temporal evolution
of the oxide layer thickness [32]. The oxide layer thickness attains a
limiting value of about 3.5 nm, which is in good agreement with the
experimental data [254]. Diffusion coefficients of aluminum and oxy-
gen atoms were estimated to be on the order of 10-4 cm2/s. A similar
study was conducted to understand the oxidation of nanoscale alumi-
num crystals at room temperature [244]. After a time period of about
100 ps, the growth kinetics followed the logarithmic law and the
thickness of the oxide layer reached a limiting value of 3 nm.

PA two-stage oxidation process has also been observed for bare sili-
con nanoparticles in oxygen [255]. Particles were initially passed
through a differential mobility analyzer that was set to transmit only
those particles having mobility diameters of about 10 nm. The mono-
dispersed particle streams were mixed with oxygen/nitrogen mixtures
of different oxygen volume fractions and allowed to react over a broad
temperature range (600(cid:1)1100 °C) for approximately one second. Par-
ticles were size-classified after reaction with a second differential
mobility analyzer. Changes in particle size were used to determine the
growth rate of the oxide layer and infer mechanism of oxidation of sil-
icon nanoparticles. The observed oxidation behavior was similar to
that of bare aluminum, with an initial fast oxidation process followed

Pby an abrupt transition to a slow oxidation regime at DDp »0.3 nm.
This roughly corresponds to the growth of the monomolecular oxide
layer. The oxygen molecules reacted directly with the silicon particle.
Once the oxide monolayer was formed, oxidation proceeded by mass
diffusion through the oxide layer. A theoretical model was developed
to describe this process. Reasonably good agreement between model
predictions and experimental data was achieved.

POxidation of passivated aluminum nanoparticles has been exten-
sively studied using a single particle mass spectrometer (SPMS) for
temperatures in the range of 25(cid:1)1100 °C and at low heating rates (<
103 K/s) [103]. The particle size range was 50(cid:1)150 nm. The particles
did not react completely. For example, at a temperature of 1373 K,
only about 40% of the particle had oxidized after 15 s. Diffusion
through the oxide layer and chemical kinetics were considered to
ascertain the rate-controlling step. Analysis of the temporal varia-
tions of the measured extent of conversion suggested that the oxida-
tion of nanoaluminum particles was controlled by mass diffusion
across the oxide layers of the particles. The particle burning time, tb,
was thus expressed as [103]

Pwhere EA is the activation energy and D0 the pre-exponential factor.
For DC arc generated particles of size »50 nm and temperature range
of 600(cid:1)900 °C, the activation energy and preexponential constant
were 69.5 kJ/mol and 1.72 £ 10-5 cm2/s, respectively [103]. The
resulting diffusion coefficients are on the order of 10-9(cid:1)10-8 cm2/s
over the temperature range of concern [103] and these are orders of
magnitude lower than the values obtained by Campbell et al. [32]. A
theoretical model of oxidation of aluminum nanoparticles was also
developed [205]. In another study [256], a two-stage oxidation pro-
cess was proposed for aluminum nanoparticles. The first step was
the formation of a 6(cid:1)10 nm thick oxide layer, which was dictated by
chemical kinetics. The second step involved mass diffusion across
the oxide layer and chemical reactions.

PIt is apparent that the diffusion coefficient is an important
parameter at low temperatures. Diffusion coefficients were calcu-
lated using molecular dynamics simulations for nano aluminum par-
ticles of diameters 5.6 and 8.0 nm [257]. Two different oxide layer
thicknesses of 1 and 2 nm were considered. Both crystalline and
amorphous oxide layers were considered. The particle was heated
from 300 to 3000 K at a heating rate of 1012 K/s and particle oxida-
tion was characterized by mass diffusion across the oxide layer. The
electric field accounted for approximately 90% of the mass flux of
aluminum ions through the oxide shell. At a temperature of 600 K,
the diffusion coefficient was on the order of 10-6 cm2/s, which is sub-
stantially greater than the values obtained by Park et al. [103]. It is
important to note that the particle sizes in MD simulations are of the
order of 10 nm, while Park et al.’s study used 50 nm particles. The
diffusion coefficient could thus be a size-dependent property; unfor-
tunately, the size dependence of the diffusion coefficient of alumi-
num particles is still poorly understood.

PAn alternative equation has also been proposed to model oxida-

tion of passivated metal particles before ignition [258]:

where h is the oxide layer thickness, E the activation energy, R the
gas constant, T the temperature, K the pre-exponential factor, and
Cox the oxidizer concentration near the particle surface. As can be
seen, there is no diffusion coefficient in the equation, but only a pre-
exponential factor and activation energy. The exponent n deter-
mines the dependence of the oxidation rate on oxide layer thickness.
The exponent n D 0 corresponds to the linear oxidation law and is
typically employed for magnesium, which is covered by a permeable
oxide layer [258]. This can be attributed to the presence of cracks
and pores in the oxide layer. For aluminum, the exponent n D 1 is
typically used, corresponding to the parabolic oxidation law [258].
The oxidation rate is controlled by mass diffusion through the oxide
layer. Two sets of data are available for the pre-exponential factor
and activation energy. For n D1, the pre-exponential factor and acti-
vation energy are 1.9 £ 10-9 m2/s and 17 kcal/mole, respectively
[258]. For n D 0, they are 18 £ 103 m/s and 20 kcal/mole, respectively
[258]. A detailed and more accurate evaluation of pre-exponential
constant can be found in [258].

PIt is evident that oxidation of bare metal nanoparticles, in general,
consists of rapid formation of the oxide monolayer followed by rela-
tively slow growth of the oxide layer. The kinetics of the formation of
the monomolecular oxide layer is not well understood. For particles
with intact oxide layers, the second stage of oxidation may follow
either the logarithmic growth rate law or the parabolic law, depending
on temperature and oxide layer thickness. While the general features
and mechanisms of low temperature oxidation of metal nanoparticles
appear to be fairly well established, quantitative prediction of impor-
tant properties such as ignition delay still remains a challenge, due to
uncertainties in parameters such as the rate constants associated with
the diffusion process and chemical reactions. Moreover, such parame-
ters are not strictly constants, but depend on many factors such as

Psample size, temperature, and so forth. Furthermore, different mecha-
nisms come in to play under different conditions and transition
between underlying mechanisms is not completely understood. Future
studies can thus attempt to address these challenges and problems.

6. Pyrophoricity of metal nanoparticles

PAn important consequence of the extreme reactivity of nanopar-
ticles is pyrophoricity. Pyrophoricity is the tendency of a substance
to burn spontaneously at room temperature. When a nascent parti-
cle is exposed to an oxidizing gas at room temperature, chemical
reactions result in the formation of an oxide layer on the particle
surface. For micron-sized and larger particles, the heat release due
to chemical reactions is not sufficient to heat the particle to the igni-
tion temperature and particle ignition is thus not achieved. If the
particle size is decreased below a critical value, however, self-
ignition can occur [22]. Pyrophoricity is a major safety issue during
synthesis, handling, and storage, although it can be useful in applica-
tions like decoy flares for defending against heat-seeking missiles
[259]. Therefore, it is important to know the particle size at which
metal particles become pyrophoric. Theoretical analyses have been
performed to determine the critical particle size, but sufficient
experimental evidence supporting these predictions is lacking.

PAnalysis of ignition was pioneered by Semenov and Frank-Kame-
netskii [260]. One of the earliest models on metal pyrophoricity was
based on the assumption of homogeneous gas-phase reactions [33],
neglecting the transient energy balance, heat losses to the ambient
gas, and size dependence of physicochemical properties. Under
these assumptions, the critical particle size was obtained by equat-
ing the chemical energy release to the sum of the energies needed to
heat the particle to its boiling point and vaporize the metal [33]:

where Tb is the boiling point of metal, and Hvap the enthalpy of
vaporization of metal. The subscripts ox and cr refer to oxidation and
critical condition, respectively. Eq. (43) was used to obtain the criti-
cal particle size for various metals. The oxide layer thickness was
taken as 2.5 nm and the critical particle size was below 100 nm. It
was shown that pyrophoricity is of concern only for nanoparticles.

PWhen a nascent particle is exposed to an oxidizing gas, the oxide
layer thickness, core diameter, and temperature vary continuously
with time. Particle ignition is thus a transient process dictated by
the competing effects of heat release due to chemical reaction and
heat loss to the ambient gas, so the steady-state assumption is
strictly not valid. A transient energy balance is thus required to
obtain a more accurate estimate of the critical particle size [22,34].

PChemical equilibrium analysis was first performed to calculate
the particle temperature after the formation of the monomolecular
oxide layer. The thickness of the monomolecular oxide layer was
taken to be 0.3 nm. Transient energy balance analysis was then con-
ducted to determine the minimum ignition temperature for particles
covered by the oxide monolayer of thickness 0.3 nm. Ignition was
assumed to be achieved when the particle temperature increased
monotonically beyond the melting point of the oxide film. As a
result, the minimum ignition temperature was the minimum initial
temperature of the particle (in the transient energy balance analysis)
If the minimum ignition temperature

was lower than the particle temperature obtained using chemical
equilibrium analysis, the particle was considered to be pyrophoric.
Fig. 36 shows a comparison of the results of chemical equilibrium
and transient energy balance analyses [22]. The two curves intersect
at the critical particle size of about 32 nm. Nascent aluminum par-
ticles smaller than 32 nm were thus predicted to be pyrophoric.

PSensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine how sensi-
tive the predictions are to changes in the physicochemical properties
and polymorphic state of the oxide layer. The temperature depen-
dence of the energy accommodation coefficient was included by
considering Altman’s equation [263]

accommodation coefficient is a strong function of gas and particle
temperatures. Parameters of the Mott(cid:1)Cabrera oxidation model
influenced the results as well. For example, increasing the Mott

ture after the growth of 0.3 nm thick oxide layer and the minimum temperature neces-
sary for ignition, suggesting a critical particle size of 32 nm for pyrophoricity (reprinted
from [22] with permission of Elsevier).

Ppotential from 1.6 to 1.75 V resulted in an increase in the critical par-
ticle size by 18%. Predictions were quite sensitive to changes in
material properties and heat transfer model. The critical particle size
increased by 40%, when bulk material properties calculated at ambi-
ent temperature were used and the oxide layer was assumed to be
in a crystalline form. It decreased by 43% when free-molecular
effects were neglected in the analysis. For an oxide layer thickness
of 0.3 nm, the critical particle size was predicted to be 3.8 nm.
Commercially available aluminum nanoparticles with oxide layer
thickness in the range of 2(cid:1)4 nm were thus predicted to be non-
pyrophoric. A similar analysis can be conducted to predict the
critical particle size for pyrophoricity for other metals.

7. Ignition of metal nanoparticles

PIgnition refers to the onset of vigorous self-sustaining exothermic
chemical reactions. In metal particles, ignition is typically caused by
phase transformations of the metal core or oxide layer, which occurs
at high temperatures, so high ignition temperatures are a matter of
concern. In order to maximize energy release rates, it is desirable
to have low ignition temperatures and ignition delays, without
compromising the metal content, safety characteristics, and shelf
life. This is one of the major challenges in the field of energetics,
since approaches to lower ignition temperatures have thus far
resulted in undesirable side effects [24,40]. For example, decreasing
the particle size from micron to nano results in loss of energy con-
tent [40] and poses processing issues [24]. A few approaches, such as
replacing the oxide layer with nickel coating, have contributed to
substantial reduction in ignition temperatures without significant
undesirable side effects [264].

PIgnition temperature depends not only on the nature of the metal
and the oxide layer, but also on other factors such as heating rate,
particle size, pressure, and gas composition. Table 5 shows the
observed ignition temperatures of metal particles. For aluminum,
ignition temperatures are in the range of 933(cid:1)2350 K [45,265,266].
Ignition of aluminum particles is attributed to melting and/or crack-
ing of the oxide layer. Cracking may be due to tensile stresses
exerted by the aluminum core [267] or polymorphic phase transfor-
mations in the oxide layer [236]. For boron, ignition is attributed to
polymorphic phase transformations of boron [268] and vaporization
of the oxide layer [269]. The measured ignition temperatures of
boron particles lie in the range of 1400(cid:1)2000 K [270(cid:1)272]. Ignition
of beryllium particles was thought to be caused by the fracture of
the oxide layer due to vaporization of beryllium [273], since the boil-
ing point of beryllium (2744 K) is lower than the melting point of
beryllium oxide (2820 K). Measured ignition temperatures of beryl-
lium particles are, however, as high as 2820 K [274,275], which sug-
gests that melting of the beryllium oxide layer could also play an
important role. For magnesium, permeability of the magnesium
oxide layer facilitates ignition [276(cid:1)279]. As a result, ignition of
magnesium particles occurs at
temperatures of 710(cid:1)1200 K
[276(cid:1)279], substantially lower than the melting and boiling temper-
atures of magnesium oxide (3125 and 3430 K). Ignition of titanium

Pparticles occurs in the range of 1100(cid:1)1700 K [280(cid:1)283] and is
attributed to a-b Ti phase transformations and changes in absorp-
tivity due to formation of titanium oxide [280].

PAmong all metals, aluminum and boron have received the most
attention. While the ignition behavior of micron-sized metal par-
ticles has been more extensively studied, ignition of metal nanopar-
ticles has been the subject of recent research and is not yet fully
understood. In the following sections, the effect of particle size on
the ignition properties of metal nanoparticles is discussed. Emphasis
is placed on aluminum particles, since the size dependence of igni-
tion of aluminum nanoparticles has been relatively well studied.
Studies on ignition of nanoparticles of other metals are limited.

7.1. Ignition of aluminum nanoparticles

P7.1.1. Size dependence of ignition temperature

PThe ignition temperature of aluminum particles is a strong func-
tion of the particle size. Fig. 37 shows the effect of particle size on
the ignition temperature of aluminum particles [40]. Experimental
data are taken from Refs. [265,266,274,284(cid:1)296]. There is consider-
able scatter in the experimental data, owing to differences in experi-
mental conditions, including apparatus, sample type, heating rate,
oxide layer thickness, and oxidizer composition. Care must therefore
be taken when analyzing and interpreting data. For example, igni-
tion temperatures of aluminum particles with diameters of the
order of 10 mm lie in the range of 1000(cid:1)2350 K. Nonetheless, there
appears to be a general trend of decreasing ignition temperatures
with decreasing particle size. Aluminum nanoparticles ignite at
temperatures as low as »1000 K, substantially lower than the bulk
melting point of the oxide shell (2350 K).

P7.1.2. Theories

P7.1.2.1. Aluminum core melting.
PIgnition of aluminum nanoparticles
may be attributed to cracking of the oxide layer upon melting of the
aluminum core [267]. Rai et al. [267] studied the thermomechanical
and oxidation behaviors of nanoaluminum particles using hot-stage
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and single-particle mass
spectrometry over a temperature range of 293(cid:1)1173 K. Particles
with an oxide layer thickness of about 3 nm and diameters in the
range of 20(cid:1)30 nm were considered. Images of particles heated in a
hot-stage TEM appeared to suggest that the oxide layer cracked
upon melting of the aluminum core. Upon melting, the density of
the aluminum core decreases from 2700 to 2400 kg/m3, an 11.1%
change. This leads to the buildup of compressive and tensile stresses
in the core and oxide shell, respectively.

where s is the stress. The subscripts r, u, and f refer to the radial,
azimuthal, and polar directions, respectively. The radial stress is cal-
culated to be 3.35 GPa, regardless of the particle size. The polar and
azimuthal stresses are substantially greater than the radial counter-
part, especially for larger particles. Note that the measured tensile
strength of bulk alumina is on the order of 0.1 GPa [299], an order of
magnitude lower than the calculated tensile stresses in the oxide
layer. If the oxide layer is rigid and brittle, the analysis suggests that
it could fracture upon melting of the molten aluminum core. The
cracks provide pathways for the oxidizing gas to react with the alu-
minum core, and the ensuing energy release results in ignition of
the nanoaluminum particles. Note that the mechanical properties of
the oxide layer are not completely understood. It is not clear if the
oxide layer is rigid or flexible. Depending on the properties, the
oxide layer may crack upon melting of the aluminum core or expand
to accommodate the developed stresses.

P7.1.2.2. Polymorphic phase transformations in oxide layer.
et al. [236] attribute ignition of aluminum particles to polymorphic
phase transformations in the oxide layer. In their study [236], oxida-
tion of 3(cid:1)14 mm aluminum powders was studied using thermogra-
vimetric analysis. The powders were heated in oxygen up to 1500 °C
at heating rates on the order of 10 K/min. Aluminum oxide exists in
different forms; the three major polymorphs of concern are amor-
phous, gamma, and alpha alumina [236]. Fig. 38 shows the stages of
oxidation of 10(cid:1)14 mm aluminum particles in oxygenated environ-
ments [236]. At about 550 °C, or when the critical oxide layer thick-
ness of 5 nm is achieved, the amorphous oxide layer transforms into
gamma alumina. The density of gamma alumina is 3660 kg/m3,
greater than that of amorphous polymorph (3050 kg/m3) [236]. A
similar phenomenon occurs during the gamma-alpha phase trans-
formation. As a result, the newly formed oxide layer does not
completely cover the particle surface, and the resulting openings
facilitate ignition of the aluminum particle over a broad range of
temperatures.

PFor each polymorph, the rate of mass growth of the oxide poly-
morph, dictated by mass diffusion across the oxide layer, was
expressed as [236]

analysis was also conducted to determine the ignition temperature of
aluminum nanoparticles. In the analysis, the particle was assumed to
ignite when its temperature reaches the melting point of the oxide
layer (2320 K). Although the analysis predicted a size-dependent igni-
tion temperature, it over-estimated ignition temperatures of alumi-
num nanoparticles. For a particle size of 100 nm, the predicted
ignition temperature was 1350 K, substantially greater than the exper-
imentally measured value of »1000 K. The disparity was attributed to

Pthe fact that the analysis considered an isolated aluminum particle,
whereas the experiments dealt with a collection of particles that could
undergo sintering and agglomeration. Note that the model employed
the continuum heat transfer model. Free-molecular effects can be con-
sidered to obtain better agreement with experimental data.

PNote that the parameters listed in Table 6 were developed
using experiments involving low heating rates (»1 K/min) and
micron-sized particles. Experiments with heating rates as high as
500 K/min have also been conducted to elucidate the heating
rate effect [300]. Activation energies obtained using high heat-
ing-rate experiments are consistent with the values listed in
Table 6, although some refinements to other parameters were
made. In a more recent study [301], the oxidation kinetics of alu-
minum nanoparticles was studied using thermogravimetric anal-
ysis in order to identify the distinguishing features at nano-
scales. Fig. 39 shows the mass gain for an oxidizing aluminum
nanopowder at different heating rates [301]. It is clear that the
oxidation of aluminum nanoparticles is qualitatively similar to
that of micron-sized particles. As with micron-sized particles,
the first oxidation step can be attributed to amorphous-gamma
phase transformation of the oxide layer, whereas the second
step can be attributed to the gamma-alpha phase transformation.
The TG results were processed to account for particle size distri-
bution, and the oxidation of particles of different sizes was char-
acterized. Activation energy and pre-exponential factors were

where Vox is the volume of the oxide layer, and mtr is the mass loss
of the polymorph due to polymorphic transformation to another
polymorph.

PFig. 41 shows a comparison of times scales of completion of core
melting and polymorphic phase transformations in the oxide layer
[297]. The oxide layer thickness was taken as 2 nm. At temperatures
near the core melting point, the characteristic time scales of poly-
morphic phase transformations are substantially greater than those
of core melting. This is due to the fact that there is significant activa-
tion energy, and polymorphic phase transformations are important
only at higher temperatures. As a result, the oxide shell is probably
not completely converted to a crystalline state during/upon melting
of the aluminum core, although this does not imply that the crystal-
lization process is completely absent. It is also important to note
that the conditions considered in Ref. [297] correspond to high heat-
ing rates. At lower heating rates (<105 K/s), polymorphic phase
transformations may be significant. Further studies are necessary to
quantify the extent of crystallization of the oxide layer and under-
stand the importance of core melting and polymorphic phase trans-
formations to ignition of aluminum particles.

P7.1.4. Oxide layer integrity and reaction front location

PIt was mentioned previously that the mechanical properties of
the oxide shell are not completely understood. Recent studies have
provided some new insight into the microstructural behavior of alu-
minum nanoparticles. Rufino et al. [302] studied the properties of
the oxide layer and structural changes upon oxidation for aluminum
nanopowders. The particle size was about 200 nm and the oxide
layer thickness was about 3 nm. Particles were synthesized using
the electric explosion process and passivated in air (nano-G) and in a
solution of stearic acid (nano-L). In addition, an oxidized powder
(nano-L-Ox) with an oxide layer thickness of 23 nm was considered.
The heating rate was on the order of 1 °C/min. Using calorimetric
measurements and in situ neutron diffraction experiments, crystalli-
zation of the amorphous oxide layer was observed. In addition, ther-
mal expansion was quantified by monitoring the variations of the
cell parameter. Results are shown in Fig. 42 [302]. For all the sam-
ples, the thermal expansion of the aluminum core was nearly the
same as that of bulk aluminum and was not affected by the crystalli-
zation of the oxide layer. This implies that the aluminum core is free
to expand and was not constrained by the oxide layer. This

Pdetermined as well. Fig. 40 shows the effect of oxide layer thick-
ness on the activation energy [301]. For diffusion-controlled
oxidation, assuming that the product rD D C exp (-E/RT), the
changes in the activation energy and pre-exponential constant
were described by the following equations [301]:

where Eam is the activation energy for the growth of the amorphous
oxide layer in kJ/mol, Camorph is the prexponential factor with units
of g/m-s, and h the oxide layer thickness in nm. The activation energy
increased with increasing oxide layer thickness due to increased
homogeneity of the amorphous oxide layer, which initially contained
defects and imperfections [301]. Fairly good agreement is achieved
with the data obtained for micron-sized particles for oxide layer thick-
nesses up to about 13 nm. The disparity for greater oxide layer thick-
nesses was attributed to changes in powder morphologies due to
sintering of particles [301]. Eqs. (57) and (58) can be used to better
describe the growth of the oxide layer thickness for nanoparticles and
predict when phase transformation and ignition are likely to occur.

P7.1.3. Characteristic time scale considerations

transformations can be compared to further understand their role in
oxidation of aluminum particle [297]. The melting time can be
obtained by considering the following energy balance [297]:

ders obtained from diffraction measurements. (nano-L: nanoparticles passivated in a liq-

Papparently contradicts the theory of cracking of the oxide layer upon
melting of the aluminum core. For particles with thicker oxide layers
(»20 nm), the thermal expansion of the aluminum core was strongly
reduced, suggesting the possible of development of internal stresses
in the aluminum core.

PIn a subsequent study, the microstructural behavior of nano-alu-
minum particles before and after melting of the aluminum core was
studied experimentally [303]. The particle diameter was 100 nm and
the oxide layer thickness was 2 nm. High-temperature X-ray diffrac-
tion analysis, hot-stage transmission electron microscopy, and high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy were employed. Lattice
spacings were monitored to probe the expansion of the aluminum
core and oxide shell. Fig. 43 shows the resulting variations of lattice
expansion and core pressure with temperature [303]. When the par-
ticle was heated beyond the core melting point, the aluminum core
expanded under almost no constraint. This is in agreement with the
findings of Rufino et al. [302]. It is evident there is no significant
compression or pressure buildup in the core upon melting. This sug-
gests that the oxide layer is flexible in nature. It is important to note
that the amorphous oxide layer transforms to g-alumina when
the particle is heated. As the crystalline phase is denser than the
amorphous phase, it was proposed that crystallization should facili-
tate pressure buildup in the core. Given that no pressure buildup
was observed, it was speculated that the crystallization process was
inhomogeneous and incomplete and existing amorphous regions
facilitated relaxation of pressure. Experimental evidence appears to
support this argument, as shown in Fig. 44 [303]. In addition, in situ
observation using hot-stage TEM was used to trace the overall mor-
phology change of the powder. Fig. 45 shows TEM images for 300
and 750 °C [303]. When the temperature reaches 750 °C, the major
portion of the particle melts and liquid Al is seen to flow out. This
study reveals a rather interesting mechanism of core melting and
crystallization operating in tandem to fracture the oxide layer.

PAn important aspect of particle oxidation is the structure of oxi-
dized aluminum particles. The question is whether reactions occur
on the outer surface of aluminum particles or at the interface
between the aluminum core and oxide layer. Rai et al. [304] con-
ducted an experimental study to investigate morphology of alumi-
num nanoparticles oxidized at different temperatures. Fig. 46 shows
TEM micrographs of aluminum particles oxidized at different tem-
peratures [304]. For temperatures lower than the melting point of
the aluminum core, oxidized particles were solid spheres, while at
higher temperatures, hollow particles were formed. This is further
substantiated by the results of recent experimental investigations
[305]. Oxidation is proposed to be governed by inward diffusion of
oxidizer or outward diffusion of aluminum through the oxide layer
before aluminum melting, while at higher temperatures outward

expansion of the molten aluminum core. Heating rates were on the order of
10 °C/min (reprinted from [303] with permission of American Chemical Society).

Pdiffusion of aluminum is the rate-controlling process. The outward
diffusion process results in the formation of hollow particles.

PAnother important issue is the location of the reaction front,
which has some influence on the structure of oxidized particles.
This has been the focus of recent experimental studies [306,307].
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed for two sets of pow-
ders with nominal size ranges of 3.0(cid:1)4.5 and 10(cid:1)14 mm, respec-
tively. For each powder,
the measured weight gain was
distributed among particles under the assumption that the oxi-
dation rate is proportional to the reaction surface area. The
resulting temporal variations of the particle mass gain obtained
from the two different powders were compared for a specific
particle size. Three different oxidation models were employed,
corresponding to ductile and rigid shells and reactions occurring
at the core-shell interface and the outer particle surface. Results
suggested that reactions occurred at the outer surface of the
rigid oxide shell and are thus controlled by outward diffusion of
aluminum cations
temperatures
(400(cid:1)1500 °C) [306]. This is also consistent with the observation
of hollow particles [205,305]. On the contrary, in wet environ-
ments, results indicate that the rigid oxide layer fractured multi-
ple times and reactions occurred at the interface or outer surface
of the particles [307]. This underlines the important role of
nature of the oxidizer on the integrity of the oxide layer. Note
that these studies were conducted for micron-sized particles.

Pdue to the tensile stress exerted by the molten aluminum core.
The molten aluminum reaches the particle surface by flowing
through the cracks and openings in the oxide layer. The ensuing
reactions and heat release can result in the ignition of nano-alu-
minum particles due to their low volumetric heat capacity. On
the other extreme, if the oxide layer is flexible and the pressure
is relaxed (e.g., by diffusion or expansion), cracking will not be
observed and particle oxidation will be characterized by mass
diffusion across the oxide layer. Depending on the diffusion coef-
ficients of the aluminum and oxidizer molecules, reactions occur
at the core-shell interface or outer surface of the particle. Note
that the interfacial oxidation result in tensile stresses on the
oxide layer. The particle mass nearly doubles upon oxidation,
while the product density increases by only about 50%. This
results in the development of additional stresses within the par-
ticle and the oxide layer may crack continuously due to geomet-
rical constraints. No such behavior is expected if reactions occur
at the outer surface of the particles. Note that the diffusion pro-
cess speeds up upon melting of the aluminum core and oxide
shell. For example, the diffusion coefficient increases by two
orders of magnitude as the temperature increases from 600 to
2000 K [257]. This corresponds to a tremendous increase in the
oxidation rate of aluminum particles.

PAnother possibility is that the oxidation mechanism can lie
between the two extremes and involve both these processes and
mechanisms. While some regions of the shell might permit expan-
sion and relaxation of stresses, other regions could crack. The rela-
tive importance of the cracking and diffusion mode can depend on
factors such as core size, oxide layer thickness, oxidizer composition,
heating rate, and so forth. This is a very important question that
needs to be addressed in future studies. It also important to note
that many of the processes described in this section can also occur in
micron-sized particles, but they may not provide sufficient energy to
ignite the particles, due to the relatively high volumetric heat capac-
ity of micron-sized particles. For example, the oxide layer may crack,
but these cracks are expected to heal quickly through oxidation.
More importantly, the energy release from the oxidation process
may not heat the particle to the critical ignition point (such as the
melting of the oxide layer) and hence particle ignition may not be
achieved. A unified and generic ignition model is desired that is
applicable to particles over a broad range of sizes from 10 nm to
100 mm. This theory must account for the changes in particle volu-
metric heat capacity and oxide layer characteristics, stress genera-
tion and relaxation mechanisms, and cracking and healing of the
oxide layer.

P7.1.6. Ignition delay

PIgnition delay can be determined by means of energy balance
analysis [297]. Fig. 49 shows the effect of particle size on the ignition
delay of aluminum particles [297]. The gas temperature was taken
to be 2500 K. For simplicity, particle oxidation was modeled using
Mott(cid:1)Cabrera kinetics. Model predictions were compared with
experimental data. For micron-sized and larger particles, ignition
delay is quadratically proportional to the particle size [265,309]. Pre-
dictions of the continuum model are in good agreement with experi-
mental data. At nano-scales, particle size exerts a weak effect on the
ignition delay. Note that the continuum model significantly under-
predicts the ignition delay and overestimates the size dependence of
the ignition delay of aluminum nanoparticles. Better agreement
with experimental data was achieved using a free-molecular model
and treating the effect of incomplete energy accommodation. Note
that the analysis did not address the complexities associated with
cracking of the oxide layer [310] and sintering and agglomeration of
particles [35]. These phenomena can be considered in a more
advanced model of ignition of aluminum particles. The analysis pro-
vided reasonable estimates of the time scales associated with

Fig. 44. High resolution TEM images of aluminum nanoparticles obtained at 660 °C
showing inhomogeneous crystallization of oxide layer. Insets of low-magnification
(a)(cid:1)(c) as indicated with boxes are shown on the right (reprinted from [303] with
permission of American Chemical Society).

PThe heating rate employed in these experimental studies was of
the order of 1 K/min, orders of magnitude lower than the heating
rates of concern to most practical applications (»106 K/s). The
mechanical properties of the oxide shell may depend on the heating
rate, shell thickness, and temperature. Further studies are warranted
to understand the properties of the oxide shell at high heating rates.
Puri and Yang [207] conducted molecular simulations of the thermo-
mechanical behavior of passivated nano-aluminum particles during
melting. The heating rate was on the order 1013 K/s, orders of magni-
tude greater than those in DSC studies. The particle size range was
5(cid:1)10 nm and the oxide layer thickness varied in the range of
1.0(cid:1)2.5 nm. Fig. 47 shows a snapshot of 5 nm aluminum particles
with crystalline and amorphous oxide layers [207]. An important
observation is the prevalence of mass diffusion across the oxide
layers of the particles. No cracking of the oxide layer was observed.
Similar observations were made by Li et al. [308] and Henz et al.
[257] in their MD simulations. Note that these MD simulations do
not treat the presence of defects and the ability of interatomic
potential functions to treat complex thermo-mechanical behaviors
is not well established.

P7.1.5. Modes and mechanisms of ignition

PBased on the results described above, it is possible to identify
different modes and mechanisms of ignition [297]. This is shown
in Fig. 48 [297]. On one extreme, if the oxide layer is rigid and
brittle and stresses are not relaxed, the oxide layer will fracture

7.2. Ignition of boron nanoparticles

PIgnition of boron particles has been extensively studied in the
past. A comprehensive review of important findings pertaining to
boron particle ignition and combustion is beyond the scope of the
present work, but such a review is presented by Yeh and Kuo [7].
Only a brief summary of the most important aspects of boron
particle ignition is presented here, so that distinguishing features of
nano-scale behavior can be identified.

PBoron particles are covered by a protective boron trioxide
(B2O3)
the oxide layer is
2316 K, lower than that of the melting and boiling temperatures
of boron, which are 2450 and 3931 K, respectively. As a result,
vaporization of boron oxide plays an important role in ignition of
boron. A two-stage burning mechanism has been proposed for boron
particles [7]. The first stage concerns particle oxidation when the
oxide layer is intact. The particle is heated due to heat transfer from
the hot ambient gas. The oxide layer then melts and species diffusion
through the oxide layer facilitates oxidation. As the particle is heated

Pto the boiling temperature of the oxide, the oxide layer is removed
by vaporization. This marks the onset of the second stage, which
involves combustion of the bare boron particle. As an alternative the-
ory, Dreizin and Calcotte [311] proposed the formation of boron-oxy-
gen liquid solution and attributed transition from the first stage to
attainment of oxygen solubility limit. Ignition temperatures of boron
particles vary in the range of 1400(cid:1)2000 K [270(cid:1)272]; this is attrib-
uted to vaporization of oxide layer and polymorphic phase transfor-
mations of boron [268].

PIgnition of boron nanoparticles was first studied by Li and
Williams [312]. A flat-flame methane-oxygen-nitrogen burner
was employed. Boron particles were transported by the nitrogen
stream into the high-temperature, oxygen-containing product
gas of the flat-flame burner. The particle radius was 50 nm. In
these boron-particle flames, a bright yellow region was clearly
visible and its thickness was greater than 5 mm. On the other
hand, the white-glow zone was hardly seen, since its thickness
was less than 0.5 mm. The bright yellow region corresponds to
particle ignition, while the white-glow zone corresponds to com-
bustion. It was therefore proposed that the particle combustion
time is much lower than the ignition time for boron nanopar-
ticles. Ignition times were inferred from the heights of the yel-
low region of the flame. Ignition time decreased from about 6 to
1.5 ms when the flat-flame temperature increased from about

Ptemperatures, ignition of passivated boron particles was attributed
to vaporization of boron oxide and exothermic reactions at the parti-
cle surface. Specifically, exothermic rate-controlled consumption of
B or BO at the oxide-gas interface dominates the ignition process
[312]. At particle temperatures lower than the cut-off value, ignition
is controlled by diffusion of oxidizer gas molecules through the
oxide layer [312].

PIn another study on ignition of boron nanoparticles [8], particles
were ignited in the post-flame region of a methane-oxygen-air flat
flame burner. Particle image velocimetry measurements coupled with
intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) camera images were used
for the determination of the ignition times of boron particles. Injected
particles were agglomerates of small primary particles, with mean
mass diameters of 679 nm. Average burner temperatures varied in
the range of 1500(cid:1)2000 K, and four different oxygen mole fractions
of 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.30 were considered. A two-stage burning
behavior was observed for boron nanoparticles, similar to the obser-
vations of Li and Williams [312]. A yellow/orange glow followed by a
bright white glow zone was observed, representing ignition and com-
bustion, respectively. For oxygen concentrations exceeding 0.1, igni-
tion was observed over a temperature range of 1578(cid:1)1872 K.
Ignition did not occur for temperatures lower than 1800 K for an oxy-
gen concentration of 0.1. An analytical expression for the ignition

Pignition temperatures of boron particles is not a strong function
of the particle size.

PThe ignition time of boron nanoparticles is weakly dependent on
oxygen concentration, and strongly dependent on the gas tempera-
ture, as shown in Fig. 51 [8]. The ignition delay decreases by a factor
of roughly three when the temperature increases from 1600 to
1800 K. Furthermore, ignition delays of boron nanoparticles are
comparable to those of micron-sized counterparts. This may be
attributed to particle agglomeration, since the powder consisted of
particle agglomerates of diameter 679 nm, which is substantially
greater than the size of the primary particles (62 nm). Furthermore,
the oxide content of the powder is quite high. The 679 nm agglomer-
ates consisted of only 72% by weight of boron.

PWhile ignition of micron-sized boron particles is relatively well
understood, ignition of boron nanoparticles remains poorly under-
stood. Some features, such as the two-stage burning process with
associated flame color changes, are common to both micron and
nano-particles. Preliminary investigations suggest that ignition tem-
peratures and delays are not strongly dependent on particle size. It
may be speculated that these could be a result of sintering and
agglomeration of particles Further studies are necessary to clearly
elucidate the ignition mechanisms and the size dependence of the
ignition properties of boron nanoparticles.

temperature range reported in the literature for micron-sized

8. Combustion of metal particles

8.1. Combustion mode

PThe mode of combustion of metal particles can be classified based
on the thermophysical properties of the metal and its oxide
[276,313]. Fig. 52 shows three possible modes of combustion of
metal particles [40]. Vapor-phase combustion involves reactions
between metal vapor and oxidizing gas. Reactions occur away from
the particle surface and a detached flame is thus established. Alter-
natively, reactions can occur at the particle surface between oxidizer
gas and metal fuel in the condensed state. In certain cases, vapor
phase and surface reactions occur simultaneously and this is referred
to as dual mode combustion.

P8.1.1. Adiabatic flame temperature considerations

;

PFor metals, the flame temperature typically does not exceed the
boiling temperature of the oxide, because the heat of reaction is
lower than the energy required to the raise the temperature of the
oxide above its boiling point [313]
¡H298 C DHvol

HR < HTvol
ð65Þ
where HR is the heat of reaction of the metal at 298 K, and DHvol the
enthalpy of volatilization of the oxide. This constrains the flame tem-
perature to be lower than or equal to the boiling point of the oxide.
As the flame temperature cannot exceed the oxide’s boiling point, it
is logical to expect that vapor phase combustion cannot be dominant
if the boiling point of the metal is greater than that of the oxide. This
does not imply that vapor-phase reactions do not occur at all, since
there is significant vapor pressure even at temperatures lower than
the boiling point for many metals. Table 7 shows the adiabatic flame
temperatures of various metals in oxygen at 1 atm pressure. The
thermophysical properties of metals and their oxides are shown in
Table 8. For all metals except boron, the heat of reaction is lower
than the energy required to the raise the temperature of the oxide
above its boiling point. Metals such as Al, Be, Li, Mg, and Ti can thus
undergo vapor-phase reactions in pure oxygen. Surface combustion
is expected to be important for zirconium, since the boiling point of
zirconium is greater than that of its oxide. For boron, although there
is sufficient energy to vaporize the oxide, there is insufficient energy
to heat the metal to its boiling temperature and vaporize the metal.
Surface reactions must therefore play an important role during com-
bustion of boron and zirconium particles.

PThe adiabatic flame temperature depends not only on particulate
material, but also on the type and concentration of the oxidizing gas
[40]. Table 9 shows the adiabatic flame temperatures of micron-

Pvalue of 3052 K for water vapor, substantially lower than for oxygen
(3977 K). It is also a function of the oxidizer concentration, decreas-
ing from 3977 K at 100% to 3546 K at 21% oxygen. For most cases,
the adiabatic flame temperature is lower than the boiling tempera-
ture of oxide (4000 K). An exception is the Al-F2 system, which is
characterized by a flame temperature of »4400 K. Note that the adi-
abatic flame temperature is typically greater than the boiling tem-
perature of aluminum at 1 atm. Vapor-phase reactions are thus
expected for most oxidizers at a pressure of 1 atm.

PGas pressure affects the adiabatic flame temperature and com-
bustion mode [40]. Fig. 53 shows the effect of pressure on the adia-
batic flame temperature of aluminum particles for different
oxidizers and particle sizes under stoichiometric conditions [40].
The boiling temperature of aluminum is a strong function of pres-
sure, increasing from 2373 K at 0.1 atm to 4441 K at 100 atm. The

Pflame temperature is lower than the boiling temperature of alumi-
num for pressures over a threshold value. The threshold pressure is
around 2, 5, and 100 atm for liquid water, carbon dioxide, and air,
respectively. Surface reactions are thus more important for water
and carbon dioxide, especially at higher pressures. Note that the cut-
off pressure in water decreases from »2.0 to 0.2 atm when the parti-
cle size decreases from 1 mm to 38 nm. This can be attributed to the
fact that the inert oxide layer constitutes a greater portion of
the particle mass at nano scales; a 38 nm aluminum particle, for
example, contains 47 wt.% oxide.

P8.1.2. Experimental evidence

PAs discussed in the previous section, metal particles can burn
homogeneously in the gas-phase and/or heterogeneously at the parti-
cle surface. For micron-sized and larger particles, experimental evi-
dence is strongly in favor of the argument that vapor-phase reactions
are dominant for micron-sized and larger aluminum [43,44,315,316],
magnesium [317, 318], and beryllium [275,319] particles in oxygen-
containing gases. An important indicator of presence of vapor-phase
reactions is the flame stand-off ratio (Df/Dp). For aluminum, the
observed flame stand-off ratios in oxygenated environments are in
the range of 2.0(cid:1)5.0, depending on various parameters such as oxi-
dizer composition and pressure [315,316,320,321]. Flame stand-off
ratios in the range of 1.15(cid:1)1.35 and as high as 10 are observed for
micron-sized beryllium particles [275,319] and magnesium particles
[317], respectively. This demonstrates the presence of vapor-phase
reactions and detached flame surrounding the particle.

PSurface reactions are more prominent for aluminum particles in
water and carbon dioxide, as evidenced by lower flame standoff
ratios [315,321(cid:1)323]. For example, the flame standoff ratio of
micron-sized aluminum particles in water vapor is about 1.3(cid:1)1.5
[309,324] and the radiation intensity of aluminum particles in car-
bon dioxide decreases with increasing distance away from the parti-
cle surface [322]. No such behavior was observed for magnesium
particles [322]. Surface reactions are also more important for other
solid fuels such as boron [7] and titanium [325,326]. For titanium
particles, a two-stage combustion phenomenon was observed [326].
In the initial stage of combustion, a luminous halo formed around
the droplet. The size of the halo was about 3(cid:1)5 times the particle
diameter. The halo was however present only for about 25% of
the total burning time, so surface reactions were dominant for the
majority of the burning period. It is important to note that flame
temperatures of micron-sized and larger particles,
in general,
are approximately equal to those of their adiabatic counterparts
[43,320,324,327,318]. Some deviations have been observed for
titanium particles [325] due to heat losses to the ambient gas.

PA number of studies have probed the combustion modes and
flame structures of metal nanoparticles, especially aluminum. The
flame structures of aluminum nanoparticles are substantially differ-
ent from those of their micron-sized counterparts. Based on heat
transfer arguments, it is logical to expect that combustion tempera-
tures of aluminum nanoparticles could be substantially lower than
the adiabatic counterparts [297]. The flame temperature is dictated
by the competing effects of heat generation due to chemical reac-
tions and heat losses to the ambient gas. If the rate of heat genera-
tion is significantly greater than that of heat loss to the ambient gas,
the particle could be heated to the boiling point of aluminum
(2700 K at 1 atm), thereby facilitating vapor-phase reactions. This is
typically the case for micron-sized and larger particles. For nano-
sized particles, on the other hand, the rate of heat loss to the ambient
gas is comparable to that of heat generation. This can be attributed
to the high surface-to-volume ratio at nano-scales. The particle tem-
perature is thus likely to be lower than the adiabatic flame tempera-
ture. Note that diameters of nanoparticles are lower than the mean-
free-path of the oxidizing gas. As a result, heat and mass transfer
occur in the free-molecular regime. In the free-molecular regime,

Pconduction heat transfer rate is proportional to pressure, while the
radiation heat transfer rate is independent of pressure. Also, radia-
tion heat transfer could be more important than conduction heat
transfer due to lower energy accommodation coefficients. The heat
generation rate is also directly proportional to pressure. Deviations
from thermal equilibrium conditions thus become significant at
higher pressures (> 1 atm). Furthermore, as the heat generation
rate is a function of the oxidizer composition, thermal equilibrium
conditions are more prevalent for carbon dioxide and water vapor
and in dilute oxygenated environments.

PExperimental studies and theoretical studies suggest heat trans-
fer peculiarities in aluminum nanoparticles at high temperatures.
Allen et al. [328] conducted shock tube experiments to measure
burning times and combustion temperatures of aluminum nanopar-
ticles in oxygenated environments. The particle size was in the range
of 18(cid:1)110 nm and ambient gas temperature was 1500 K. The con-
centration of oxygen in the gas was 20%. An energy balance analysis
was also performed to calculate burning times and flame tempera-
tures. The burning rate was assumed to be controlled by the collision
of gas molecules on the particle surface. Heat losses to the ambient
gas by conduction and radiation were considered [328].

heat of reaction, a the energy accommodation coefficient, f the

mann constant, e the emissivity, and A the particle surface area.
The energy accommodation coefficient is the ratio of the actual
energy transfer during gas-particle collision to the theoretical
maximum value corresponding to thermal equilibration. The
sticking probability gives the fraction of gas molecule collisions
that result in chemical reactions. Fig. 54 shows variations of
burning time and flame temperature with sticking probability for
different heat
transfer models [328]. Satisfactory agreement
between predicted and measured flame temperatures and burn-
ing times could be achieved only by using the free-molecular
heat transfer model with accommodation coefficients and stick-
ing probabilities on the order of 0.001 [328]. These are orders of
magnitude lower than the value commonly reported in the liter-
ature for an oxidized aluminum surface [329]. Experiments and
high-fidelity theoretical studies such as molecular dynamics sim-
ulations, with reliable gas-surface interaction potential functions,
need to be conducted to explore the temperature and size
dependencies of accommodation coefficients of aluminum nano-
particles. Sticking probabilities also need to be determined.

PFig. 55 shows the effect of particle size on the measured flame tem-
peratures of aluminum particles in oxygenated and carbon dioxide
environments [40]. Measurements at 1 atm pressure correspond to
laser ignited particles [315,320,330] and those at higher pressures cor-
respond to particles ignited in a shock tube [331,332]. The flame tem-
perature was determined by monitoring the intensity of the light
emitted by the particles. For micron-sized aluminum particles, the
measured flame temperatures are approximately equal to their adia-
batic counterparts. At nano-scales, flame temperatures are substantially
lower than the adiabatic counterparts over a pressure range of 4(cid:1)8

gas temperatures [8]. This trend is in agreement with the results of the

Pet al. stems from the fact that the ambient gas temperature was varied
in the range of 1200(cid:1)2100 K. The flame temperature is, however, as
high as »3400 K at 32 atm, suggesting that deviations from thermal
equilibrium conditions are substantial at a pressure of 32 atm. Note
that the boiling temperature of bulk aluminum is also a pressure-
dependent parameter and it takes a value of 3800 K at 32 atm. As a
result, surface reactions are expected to be important over the pressure
range of concern. This is more so, if size dependence of boiling temper-
ature is considered. Another important observation to note is that the
flame temperature is nearly independent of ambient gas temperature
at a pressure of 32 atm. This suggests that some limiting temperature
is achieved, possibly the boiling temperature at that pressure.

PTransition from continuum to the free-molecular heat transfer
regime is yet another factor that drives the flame closer to the parti-
cle surface [333]. To sustain a vapor-phase flame, it was postulated
that the energy released in the stationary flame zone must balance
heat losses to the particle and ambient gas. Energy balance analysis
was conducted to determine the critical particle size at which vapor-
phase flame ceases to exist [333]. For a given particle size, a large
flame is harder to sustain, due to greater heat losses to the ambient
gas and reduced heat transfer to the particle. This can be attributed
to the fact that the vaporization rate (and chemical energy release
rate) decreases with decreasing rate of heat transfer to the particle.
Fig. 56 shows the effect of particle size on the maximum value of the
flame-to-particle diameter ratio (D D Df/Dp) for different oxidizers.
The continuum model indicates that the flame is detached from the
particle surface, irrespective of the particle size. The calculated
flame-to-particle diameter ratio D is in the range of 1.5(cid:1)2.5 [333],
which agrees with experimental data . The free-molecular model, on
the other hand, suggests that the flame is located closer to the parti-
cle surface for smaller particles. The calculated critical particle diam-
eters are 6.1, 7.2, and 15.1 mm for air, carbon dioxide, and water
vapor, respectively [333]. Results suggest that surface reactions are
important for combustion of nano aluminum particles. This is con-
sistent with the predictions of heat transfer analysis and results of
experimental studies.

PAnother important indicator of the presence of vapor-phase reac-
tions is gas-phase Al and AlO emission. [331]. If gaseous aluminum
were present, atomic aluminum lines would probably be seen at
394.4 and 396.1 nm, and banded aluminum monoxide (AlO) emis-
sion from the B-X transition would probably be seen in the range
from 460(cid:1)530 nm. Fig. 57 shows the emission spectra for
38(cid:1)45 mm and 80 nm Al particles [331,332]. For micron-sized Al
particles, spectra indicate significant gas-phase AlO emission [332].
No such emission was detected for nano-aluminum particles in

mum value of flame-to-particle radius ratio for different oxidizers (adapted from

Pcarbon dioxide environments for pressures as high as 32 atm and in
oxygenated environments for pressures as high as 8 atm [331]. At
32 atm, AlO emission is detected, suggesting the presence of vapor-
phase reactions [331]. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that
the limiting combustion temperature »3400 K is perhaps associated
with boiling of aluminum particles. The general lack or insignificance
of gas phase emission suggests the importance of surface reactions
during combustion of nanoaluminum particles.

PWhile all the evidence suggests that surface reactions are more
prominent for aluminum nanoparticles, it is unclear at what critical
particle size, transition from vapor-phase to surface combustion
regime occurs for a given set of conditions. Note that the transition
process could be a function of pressure, nature and concentration of
the oxidizing gas, and so forth. This needs to be investigated and
experimental evidence is required. Furthermore, studies are neces-
sary to ascertain the relative importance of surface and vapor-phase
reactions over a broad range of pressures (1(cid:1)100 atm). In this
regard, the size and pressure dependencies of combustion tempera-
tures also need to be studied, especially for pressures exceeding 32
atm. This would be helpful in determining the mode of combustion
of aluminum nanoparticles over the pressure range of concern.

8.2. Rate controlling processes

PIn order to understand the mechanism of combustion of metal
nanoparticles, it is essential to know and understand the underlying
physicochemical processes. The particle consists of a metal core and
an oxide layer, which is enveloped by the oxidizing gas. The three
important processes that typically control the burning rate of the
particle are (1) mass diffusion through the gas-phase mixture; (2)
mass diffusion across the oxide layer of the particle; and (3) chemi-
cal reactions [334]. In this analysis, it is assumed that the oxide layer

Poffers negligible diffusion resistance. The phenomenon of mass dif-
fusion across the oxide layer will thus not be considered. It is useful
to first understand particle burning behaviors in the limit of diffu-
sion and kinetically-controlled conditions.

PCertain metals are volatile and can undergo vapor-phase reac-
tions, while others do not vaporize and reactions occur at the parti-
cle surface. For vaporizing particles, the droplet mass burning rate
per unit area under diffusion-controlled conditions can be obtained
from classical droplet combustion theory [260]:

8.3. Particle burning time

P8.3.1. Characteristic time scales

PBurning time is an important measure of the reactivity of the par-
ticles. It is typically a function of many parameters such as particle
size, oxide layer thickness, pressure and temperature of the gas, and
gas composition. For diffusion-controlled conditions, Eq. (70) can be
integrated to obtain an expression for the particle burning time:

PUnder diffusion-controlled conditions,

the burning time is
quadratically proportional to particle size and is independent of gas
pressure, since the pressure effects of density and diffusivity coun-
teract each other. On the other hand, if particle combustion is lim-
ited by chemical kinetics, an expression for the burning time can be
obtained by integrating Eq. (74):

where k is the rate constant and X the mole fraction. For kinetically-
controlled conditions, the burning time is strongly dependent on

Ptemperature, since the chemical rate constant is an exponential
function of temperature. Furthermore, the burning time is inversely
proportional to pressure, since we assumed a first order reaction.

PTransition from diffusion to kinetically controlled conditions
occurs at a threshold particle size, which is a function of the temper-
ature and pressure of the ambient gas. The threshold particle size
can be determined by calculating the Damkohler number, which is
the ratio of diffusion and chemistry time scales [37]:

PEq. (77) suggests that diffusion controlled conditions are preva-
lent at high pressures and for large particles, while kinetically-
controlled conditions are applicable at low pressures and for small
particles. Increasing the temperature also appears to favor diffusion-
controlled conditions.

PTo determine the threshold particle size, the diffusion coeffi-
cient and chemical rate constant must be known. The diffusion
coefficient of oxygen in air is a well-known parameter [335]. The
chemical rate constant, on the other hand, is not well known. In
Yeh and Kuo’s study [7], the chemical rate constant for boron
combustion was obtained as 0.0625 mol/cm2-s-atm [312]. Substi-
tuting the values of various parameters, the critical particle size
is obtained as 75 mm at 1 atm pressure. A similar estimate can
be obtained for aluminum particles [40]. The chemical rate con-
stant can be estimated from the experimental data of Bazyn
et al. [331]. In Bazyn et al.’s study, the particle size was 80 nm
and the gas consisted of 50% oxygen and 50% nitrogen by mole.
The activation energy was obtained using a curve-fit to burning
time vs. temperature. At a pressure of 8 atm, the activation
energy was 71.6 kJ/mol and the burning time was 0.29 ms at
1400 K. The resulting preexponential constant is 1618.5 mol/m2-
s-atm. The resulting threshold particle size is »100 mm at 1 atm
pressure. As a result, to a good approximation, it may be gener-
ally said that deviations from diffusion-controlled conditions
become important at a particle size of 100 mm. Kinetically-con-
trolled conditions are prevalent for nanoparticles at 1 atm pres-
sure. For intermediate particle sizes (1 < Dp < 100 mm), both the
diffusion process and chemical reactions control the burning
rate. Note that the threshold particle size is also a function of
the pressure and temperature of the ambient gas. For example,
the threshold particle size decreases from 100 to 10 mm, as the
pressure increases from 1 to 10 atm. As a result, mass diffusion
could also be rate-limiting for nanoparticles at very high pres-
sures and temperatures. Note that the calculated threshold parti-
cle sizes should be regarded as estimates rather than exact
values.

P8.3.2. Burning time of micron-sized particles

PFor micron-sized and larger particles, the burning time has a size
dependence of the form tb D a Dp
n, where the exponent n is in the
range of 1.5(cid:1)2.0, as observed for aluminum [45,295,316,336], mag-
nesium [317,318,337], titanium [338,326], beryllium [275,319] and
boron particles [269]. In this regime, the burning time is weakly
dependent on the temperature and pressure of the ambient gas
[339,340]. For aluminum particles, Beckstead [340] assimilated
numerous experimental data from various sources and proposed the
following correlation for the burning time of aluminum particles

Pcorrections should be made to describe particle combustion in tur-
bulent conditions [341]. Note that Eq. (78) is valid only for particle
diameters greater than 20 mm [15].

PDeviations from diffusion-controlled conditions have been
observed as the particle size approaches 10 mm at high pressures
[332]. This is in agreement with the Damkohler number analysis. For
a 10 mm aluminum powder, the burning time is roughly inversely
proportional to gas pressure [332]. This is contrary to the weak pres-
sure dependence of burning time of larger particles The following
correlation has been proposed for the burning time of micron-sized
aluminum particles in the transition regime [342]:

PThe constants are given in Table 10 [342]. In Eq. (79), the particle
diameter is in microns. The diameter exponent, n, decreases with
increasing oxidizer concentration, from 2.0 at 0% to 0.0 at 100%. For
oxygen and carbon dioxide, the burning time is roughly inversely
proportional to the square root of the oxidizer concentration. A
stronger concentration effect is observed for water vapor. The pres-
sure exponents are ¡0.50, 0.30, and 0.75 for oxygen, carbon dioxide,
and water vapor, respectively. Models for combustion of particles in
transition regime have also been recently developed [343].

PDeviations from the classical behavior have been observed
for particulates of other metals. Fig. 58 shows the effect of
particle size on the burning time of titanium and zirconium particles

P[325,326,344,345], while those for zirconium are taken from Refs
[344,346]. For particles larger than about 20 mm, the burning time is
nearly quadratically proportional to the particle size. For smaller
particles, the burning time is weakly dependent on the particle size;
the burning-time diameter exponent is 0.22 for titanium particles.
A similar trend is observed for boron particles [7].

PMany aspects of the combustion of metal particles in the transi-
tion regime are not completely understood. It is not completely clear
at what particle size the effects of finite-rate kinetics become impor-
tant for different conditions. While theoretical predictions give us
rough estimates, sufficient empirical evidence is lacking and there is
considerable uncertainty in burning time data of fine micron-sized
metal particles that burn in the transition regime. Effects of different
parameters such as the particle size, pressure, and gas composition
also needs to be clearly understood.

P8.3.3. Burning time of nanoparticles

PSubstantially different burning behaviors have been observed for
metal nanoparticles. Ambient gas temperature has a pronounced
effect on the burning properties of nanoparticles [40]. Fig. 59 shows
the effect of gas temperature on the burning time of nanoaluminum
particles [40]. In the study of Parr et al. [285], the oxidizer was water
vapor and the gas pressure was 1 atm, while the work of Bazyn et al.
[331], particles burned in an oxygen-nitrogen gas over a pressure
range of 4(cid:1)32 atm. The burning time has a temperature dependence
of the form [40]

tb

D A exp ¡EA=RT
ð

Þ;

ð81Þ

where the activation energy, EA, falls in the range of 50(cid:1)144 kJ/mol.
The strong temperature dependence of burning time supports the
theory that the combustion of aluminum nanoparticles is controlled
by chemical kinetics. Such a temperature dependence of burning
time was also observed for boron nanoparticles [8] and in a more
recent study on aluminum nanoparticles [347]. Fig. 60 shows the
effect of gas temperature on the burning time of boron nanoparticles
[8]. The activation energy is about 33 kJ/mol. These results are con-
trary to those obtained for micron sized and larger particles; the
burning time of micron-sized particles is weakly dependent on the
gas temperature.

PParticle size exerts a weak effect on the burning time of metal
nanoparticles [40]. Fig. 61 shows the effect of particle size
on the burning time of aluminum particles in different oxidizing
environments
[40]. Experimental data are taken from Refs.
[45,285,330,336,348(cid:1)350]. The burning time has a size dependence

where A is the burning time constant. Note that Df D 2 corresponds
to a non-fractal surface and a linear relationship between burning
time and particle size is recovered. For fractal surfaces (Df > 2), the
diameter exponent is lower than unity and the exponent depends on
the fractal dimension. The fractal theory is not without its limitations.
For example, the oxide layer is likely to melt during combustion,
since combustion temperatures are as high as »3400 K and melting
temperatures of nano-scale oxide layers could be substantially lower
than the bulk value. Once the oxide layer melts, the surface is no
longer expected to be fractal and the applicability of this theory
becomes questionable. Another theory that has been put forward to
explain the anomalous behavior is that sintering and aggregation of
nanoparticles results in loss of surface area and the measured burn-
ing times may not correspond to initial particle size [35,351]. Recent
studies [353(cid:1)355] have attempted to understand the combustion of
nanoparticle aggregates, but further research is necessary. The phe-
nomenon of weak size dependence of burning time still remains
poorly understood and further studies are required.

POxidizer concentration and pressure are two other parameters
that dictate the burning behaviors of nanoparticles [40]. Fig. 63
shows the effects of oxidizer concentration and pressure on the
burning time of 80 nm aluminum particles in oxygenated environ-
ments [331]. The burning time decreases with increasing oxidizing
concentration. The effect of pressure on the burning time of nano-
aluminum particles is not completely understood. At temperatures
lower than 1600 K, the burning time decreases by a factor of three
when the gas pressure increases from 8 to 32 atm. The burning time
is, however, a relatively weak function of the gas pressure at temper-
atures greater than 1600 K. The following correlation can be used
to calculate the burning time of nanoaluminum particles at 1 atm
pressure [40]:

where the exponent n is 0.3, substantially lower than unity. A similar
size dependence of the burning time was observed for boron nano-
particles, as shown in Fig. 62 [8]. Experimental data are obtained
from Refs. [8,269,312]. While a weak size dependence of burning
time is expected from a chemical kinetics standpoint, the fact that
the diameter exponent is lower than unity is puzzling.

PThe weak particle size effect on the burning time has been attrib-
uted to sintering and aggregation of particles [35,351,352] and/or
the fractal nature of the particle surface [310]. The presence of cracks
in the oxide layer necessitates a fractal analysis. For fractal surfaces,
the surface area is related to particle diameter as follows [40]:

P[40]. This suggests that mass diffusion through the gas-phase mix-
ture does not control the burning rate of metal nanoparticles, even
when free-molecular effects are considered.

PNote that mass diffusion across the oxide layer of the particle was
not treated, perhaps the oxide layer fractures due to tensile stresses
exerted by the molten aluminum core [267] or polymorphic phase
transformations [236]. The role of the oxide layer during combustion
of nanoaluminum particles remains poorly understood; it is possible,
but unlikely, that the oxide layer imposes significant diffusion resis-
tance during combustion. To account for diffusion resistance, the
diffusion coefficient must be specified. Unfortunately, there is sub-
stantial uncertainty in the diffusion coefficient. In the study of Park
et al. [103], the diffusion coefficient was estimated to be on the order
of 10-13(cid:1)10-12 m2/s over a temperature range of 873¡1173 K. Diffu-
sion coefficients obtained from MD simulations were of the order of
10¡9¡10¡7 m2/s over the temperature range of 1000(cid:1)2000 K [257].
These values are orders of magnitude greater than the experimental
data, but it is important to recognize that MD predictions correspond
to particles smaller than 10 nm and high heating rates (> 1010 K/s),
while experimental studies correspond to larger particles and much
lower heating rates (»1 K/s). Further studies are required to estab-
lish a database for diffusion coefficients in the oxide layer for
various conditions. More importantly, efforts must be made to eluci-
date the role of the oxide layer during combustion of aluminum
nanoparticles.

PAlternative theories have been proposed to explain the combus-
tion mechanisms of nano-aluminum particles. Levitas et al. [224]
proposed a melt-dispersion mechanism for high heating rate situa-
tions (>106 K/s). Melting of the aluminum core creates pressures of
1(cid:1)4 GPa, which causes spallation of the oxide shell. The ensuing
pressure imbalance between the core and the exposed surface
results in an unloading wave and disperses small liquid aluminum
clusters and these clusters react with the oxidizing gas. Sufficient
empirical evidence of the proposed melt-dispersion mechanism is,
however, still lacking. Lynch et al. [356] employed absorption spec-
troscopy to detect the presence of aluminum vapor for 80 nm alumi-
num particles in argon at 7 atm with the help of a shock tube. The
gas temperature was decreased from 3000 K in increments of about
100 K until no aluminum vapor was seen in the absorption spectrum.
Aluminum vapor was not present at temperatures lower than
2275 K. If aluminum clusters were present, measurements should
have detected the aluminum vapor corresponding to the equilibrium
partial pressure. This suggests that spallation of the oxide layer and
dispersion of aluminum clusters do not occur upon melting of the
aluminum core. Experimental evidence of the proposed melting dis-
persion mechanism is quite scarce [357]. The applicability of melt-
dispersion theory is thus still debated.

8.5. Stages of oxidation of aluminum particles

PObservations from various studies can be used to develop a phe-
nomenological theory of oxidation of aluminum particles [297]. Oxi-
dation behaviors of nanoparticles can be distinguished from those of
micron-sized particles. In general, the oxidation of aluminum par-
ticles can be divided into different stages based on phase transfor-
mations and chemical reactions [297]. Figs. 64 and 65 show the
stages of oxidation of nano- and large micron-sized aluminum par-
ticles, respectively [297]. In the first stage, the particle is heated to
the melting temperature of the aluminum core. The key processes
are heat and mass transfer between the gas and particle surface and
diffusion of mass and energy inside the particle. The second stage
begins upon melting of the aluminum core. Melting results in pres-
sure buildup and facilitates outward motion of the molten alumi-
num by diffusion and/or flow through the cracks in the oxide layer.
Melting may also be accompanied or followed by polymorphic phase
transformations, which also result in the formation of openings in

Fig. 63. (a) Effect of oxygen concentration on burning time of 80 nm aluminum
particles at pressure of 32 atm and temperature of 1500 K; (b) effect of pressure on
burning time of 80 nm aluminum particles in an oxygenated environment (reprinted
from [331] with permission of Elsevier).

Pwhere Ea D 80 kJ/mol is the activation energy, R the gas constant, T
the temperature, CO the oxidizer mole fraction, and A the constant
(D 162,127). Note that the correlation does not consider effects of
oxidizer and pressure on the burning time, since they are poorly
understood. In general, experimental data on burning times of nano-
particles are scarce, and more studies are needed.

8.4. Other processes and mechanisms

PComparison of diffusion and chemical time scales suggest that
nanoparticles typically burn under kinetically-controlled conditions.
Note that Eq. (70) is strictly valid in the continuum regime. In the
free-molecular regime, the mass burning rate under diffusion-con-
trolled conditions can be expressed as [30]

PHere, the burning time is a linear function of the particle size and
inversely proportional to gas pressure. This may suggest that the
burning time of nanoparticles can be diffusion-controlled, but the
diffusion theory cannot account for the strong temperature depen-
dence of the burning time. Furthermore, the resulting burning time
of 80 nm Al particles under diffusion-controlled conditions are sev-
eral orders of magnitude lower than the measured burning times

PReactions typically occur heterogeneously in the particle, and the
burning rate is limited by chemical kinetics. For large micron-sized
particles, polymorphic phase transformations result in the formation
of a crystalline oxide layer. The oxide layer melts and particle igni-

PAlthough new insights have been obtained and a crude picture of
nano-aluminum combustion has been established, there are many
uncertainties and several physicochemical phenomena remain
incompletely understood. Experimental studies are needed to quan-
tify burning time and combustion temperatures of aluminum nano-
particles over a broader range of pressures, particle sizes, and for

Pdifferent oxidizing gases. Attempts must be made to elucidate the
mode and mechanism of combustion. Recently, efforts have been
made to conduct meso/macro-scale [328,358(cid:1)363] and atomistic-
scale simulations [207,257,308,364] of aluminum nanoparticle com-
bustion. A comprehensive multi-scale model of combustion of
metal nanoparticles can be developed. Results from atomistic-scale
simulations can be used as inputs to develop a predictive model and
minimize the number of empirical and adjustable parameters.

9. Nanoparticle-laden dust clouds

PA dust cloud consists of particles suspended in an oxidizing
gas (such as air) at very low particle concentrations. Dust clouds
pose explosion hazards due to the extreme reactivity of fine
particles. From a safety perspective,
it is thus important to
understand conditions that favor explosions, so that appropriate
precautions can be taken. Explosion characteristics are typically
studied in a spherical vessel under constant volume conditions,
while combustion behaviors are investigated under constant
pressure conditions.

9.1. Explosion characteristics of dust clouds

PVarious parameters can be used to characterize the explosion of
dust clouds. These include ignition temperature, ignition energy,
minimum explosion concentration, and peak values of the pressure
and pressurization rate. Explosion characteristics are commonly
investigated using a 20 L apparatus, as shown in Fig. 66 [365], in
accordance with the principles of the standard ISO 6184-1 [365]. The
test chamber is a hollow spherical vessel made of stainless steel. A
cooling water jacket dissipates heat generated due to explosion. The
dust is dispersed into the sphere from a pressurized storage chamber
via the outlet valve and a disperser. Ignition is achieved using two
5 kJ pyrotechnic ignitors. The ignition delay is set at 60 ms as per
standards. The goal of the experiment is to determine whether an
explosion occurs for a given set of adjustable conditions. The adjust-
able conditions include type, size, and concentration of the particles.
The energy supplied by the ignitors promotes reactions and cre-
ates conditions favorable for explosion, while heat losses to the
ambient environment attempt to prevent an explosion. Note that
prevalence of reactions does not necessarily imply explosion, as
the rate of the reactions may not always be sufficient to cause
an explosion.

PExplosions occur when the dust concentration exceeds the
Minimum Explosion Limit (MEL) [366]. Fig. 67 shows the effect
of particle size on the minimum explosion limit of aluminum

particle size, from about 30 g/m3 at 50 mm to 500 g/m3 at 90 mm.
The minimum explosion limit is a weaker function of particle
size for finer particles and attains a limiting value of »30 g/m3.
The minimum explosion limit can be determined based on the

the energy required to heat the mixture to the ignition temperature.
If heat losses are neglected, the minimum explosion limit can be

PAs can be seen, the primary effect of particle size stems from the
size dependence of ignition temperature. It must be cautioned that
aggregation and agglomeration could occur in dust clouds and the
resulting ignition temperatures could be different from those of iso-
lated particles. This may partly explain the plateauing of the mini-
mum explosion limit for smaller particles. A more rigorous energy
balance analysis considering the effect of heat losses can be per-
formed to achieve better understanding.

PThe minimum ignition energy is also a size-dependent parameter
[366]. Fig. 68 shows the effect of particle size on the minimum igni-
tion energy of aluminum particle dust clouds [366], using the experi-
mental data from Refs. [367(cid:1)369,371,372]. The minimum ignition
energy decreases with decreasing particle size. A similar trend was
observed for titanium and iron particles [373]. The size dependence
of minimum ignition energy can be obtained from classical ignition
theory. Essentially, the ignition energy is the energy required to heat
up a region of the dust cloud to the adiabatic flame temperature

where _v is the reaction rate, which is inversely proportional to parti-

attributed to variations of burning time with particle size. Physically,
lowering the burning time increases the heat-generation rate within
the ignition kernel compared to the rate of heat loss from the igni-
tion kernel to the ambience. This would facilitate heat up of the
ignition kernel to the adiabatic flame temperature.

PThe explosion pressure and pressurization rate are two other
parameters of concern [366]. Fig. 69a shows the effect of particle
concentration on the maximum explosion pressure of an aluminum
particle dust cloud [366]. The maximum explosion pressure is a
strong function of the dust concentration and typically peaks for
fuel-rich conditions. Note that the stoichiometric fuel concentration
of the Al-air dust cloud is 305 g/m3. As the explosion pressure is
dependent on the adiabatic flame temperature, it is logical to expect
it to peak near stoichiometric conditions. The unexpected behavior
can be explained by considering the effect of incomplete combustion
of particles [365]. Similar trends have been reported for other metal
particle dust clouds [374,375]. Note that the maximum explosion
pressure is expected not to be a strong function of the particle size,
as the explosion studies of Li et al. for nano-aluminum dust clouds
suggest [376]. This is because pressure is merely a thermodynamic
property and does not depend on the reaction rate of particles.
Micron-sized particle dust clouds however reveal a significant size-
dependence of explosion pressure [375,376]. The discrepancy could
be due to the effects of heat losses and energy consumption during
the ignition process [375]. Unused energy supplied during ignition
can increase the explosion pressure. Also, heat losses to the ambi-
ence, which lower the explosion pressure, could be more important
for micron-sized particles that burn relatively slowly.

PFig. 69b shows the effect of specific surface area on the maximum
pressurization rate [366]. Experimental data are taken from Refs.
[377(cid:1)379]. For micron-sized particles, the maximum pressurization
rate increases with increasing specific surface area. This is not sur-
prising, since the pressurization rate depends on the reaction

different particle sizes; (b) variation of maximum pressurization rate with specific

Pkinetics, which is a strong function of the particle size [365]. At
the maximum pressurization rate decreases with
nano-scales,
decreasing particle size. In a more recent study, the maximum pres-
surization rate was found to be a weak function of the particle size
over a size range of 30(cid:1)110 nm [376]. For magnesium particles, the
peak pressurization rate decreases with decreasing size in the range
of 30(cid:1)200 nm [380]. These surprising results can be attributed to
particle agglomeration and enhanced oxide layer content in the par-
ticle at nanoscales [381(cid:1)383].

PWhile many of the experimental observations can be qualita-
tively explained by classical theories, there are several unexpected
results and trends that warrant further investigations. In particular,
the size and concentration effects on many explosion parameters
appear to be strongly influenced by the effects of incomplete com-
bustion, heat losses, and particle agglomeration. The effect of the
oxide layer also needs to be explored. Future studies should focus on
these problems, with the objective of quantifying the explosion
severity of nanoparticle-laden dust clouds for a wide range of parti-
cle sizes and dust concentrations. A more rigorous energy balance
analysis that considers the aforementioned phenomena would be a
good starting point in this direction.

9.2. Flame propagation characteristics of dust clouds

tion of a homogeneous fuel-oxidizer system is the laminar flame
speed. The flame speed of metal particle-laden dust clouds can be

Pmeasured in a number of different ways, including Bunsen burner
[384,385], latex balloons [386], and open field flame propagation
[386]. Fig. 70 shows a schematic of one of the more common experi-
mental setups used to measure flame speeds of aluminum particle
dust clouds [387]. A cylindrical quartz tube is packed with aluminum
powder and cartridge-loaded at the base. The powder is fed into the
break-up region by a linear actuator located at the bottom of the
aerosol assembly. A high velocity oxidizer shear flow emerging from
a 75 mm thick annular flow removes a layer of the powder to form a
homogeneous aerosol. The dust cloud is ignited using a hydrogen-air
pilot flame atop the tube exit. Early studies on micron-sized particle
dust clouds made some interesting observations. The flame speed
was found to be weakly dependent on the dust concentration for
fuel-rich mixtures [15,384,385]. This was attributed to the fact that
the flame temperature is not strongly dependent on equivalence
ratio for these equivalence ratios and the particle burning time is a
weak function of temperature in the diffusion regime [384,388]. For
particle concentrations exceeding 750 g/m3, however, the flame
speed decreased with increasing dust concentration [389]. This was
attributed to the increase in the heat capacity of the mixture with
increasing loading density of particles [389].

PThe flame speed of particle-laden dust clouds can be enhanced by
substituting nanoparticles for
their micron-sized counterparts
[385,390]. Fig. 71 shows photographs of burner stabilized flames for
nanoaluminum particle concentrations of 0 and 20% [387]. Two sets
of powders with particle diameters of 5(cid:1)8 mm and 100 nm were
employed. The dust concentration in this study was varied in the
range of 263(cid:1)448 g/m3. Addition of nanoaluminum particles results
in a thicker flame due to the presence of two distinct reaction zones
corresponding to micron and nanoparticles. This is not surprising,
considering that micron and nanoparticles have different ignition
temperatures. Fig. 72 shows the effect of loading density of nanoalu-
minum particles on the flame speed of aluminum particle dust cloud
[385]. The flame speed increases with increasing loading density,
from »10 cm/s at 0 wt.% to 30 cm/s at 30 wt.%. It is apparent that

Pnanoparticles have a positive effect on the flame speed of aluminum
particle dust clouds. This can be attributed to the fact that the igni-
tion temperatures and burning times of aluminum nanoparticles are
lower than those of micron-sized particles.

PTheoretical analysis has been conducted to gain insight into the
underlying processes and mechanisms [15,388,391]. The work con-
sidered mass and energy balances and enforced continuities of tem-
perature and heat flux at the interfacial boundaries.
Ignition
temperatures and burning times of particles were inputs to the anal-
ysis. Fig. 73 shows the effect of particle size on the flame speed of
the aluminum dust cloud in air [15]. The flame speed increases with
decreasing particle size and the obtained trend is consistent with
the experimental data. For premixed systems, the flame speed
expression takes the following form:

p

where a is the thermal diffusivity and _v the reaction rate. As the
reaction rate is inversely proportional to burning time, the flame
speed is greater for smaller particles. Furthermore, as the particle
diameter decreases from the micron to the nano-scale range, the
flame speed increases and the combustion transitions from a diffu-
sion-controlled to a kinetically controlled mode. For micron-sized
and larger particles, the flame speed can be correlated with the
particle size according to a d¡m relationship, with m being 0.92. A
similar trend has been observed for iron dust clouds [392]. At

the burning time of

PSlurry fuels, which are mixtures of liquid and solid fuels, are
attractive high-energy fuels for volume-limited air-breathing
propulsion applications. The burning characteristics of slurry
droplets consisting of micron-sized boron [396(cid:1)399] and alumi-
num [349,400,401] particles at relatively high loading densities
(40(cid:1)80 wt.%) have been studied experimentally. A detailed
review on slurry fuels was published in Ref. [402]. The oxidation
of slurry droplets begins by vaporization of the liquid fuel and
aggregation of left-over particles [402]. The formation of agglom-
erates due to vaporization of liquid fuel presents a critical prob-
lem, however,
resulting
agglomerate is substantially greater than that of individual par-
ticles [402]. The disruption/microexplosion of the slurry droplet,
an important event during slurry droplet combustion, alleviates
the problem to some extent [402]. This phenomenon was first
observed for slurries of boron/JP-10 droplets [397]. Two boron
samples, amorphous (0.20(cid:1)0.32 mm) and crystalline (3.57 mm),
were employed. The micro-explosion phenomenon can be
explained by Law’s diffusion limit model [403]. The droplet sur-
face becomes more concentrated with the less volatile, high-boil-
ing-point component, and the droplet
interior has a higher
concentration of the more volatile, low-boiling-point component.
The latter can be heated beyond its local boiling point, leading to
the onset of homogenous nucleation and intense internal pres-
sure buildup, and resulting in fragmentation of the droplet. The
fragmentation is accompanied by ejection of particles or aggre-
gates, which provides a means for dispersal and ignition of the
metal particles. This behavior was also observed for aluminum
slurries [401].

PWhile combustion of microparticle-laden fuel droplets appears to
be relatively well studied, nanoparticle-laden fuel droplets have
received limited attention. In a recent study, combustion of ethanol
and n-decane droplets with aluminum particles of diameters 80 nm,
5 mm, and 25 mm were qualitatively described [404]. Experiments
were performed in a closed cylindrical stainless-steel chamber. A sil-
icon carbide fiber with a diameter of 78 mm was used to suspend the
droplet. Droplets were ignited in air at 1 atm pressure. Ignition was
achieved by heating a nickel-chromium wire located beneath the
droplet. The burning process was recorded by two high-speed digital
cameras and the droplet temperature was measured using thermo-
couples. Particle concentration was 10 wt.%. A surfactant was used
to minimize particle agglomeration.

PFig. 74 shows the burning sequence of a stabilized n-decane/
nano-aluminum droplet [404]. The corresponding droplet size and
temperature histories are shown in Fig. 75 [404]. Five distinct stages
were observed: (1) preheating and ignition; (2) classical droplet
combustion; (3) micro-explosion; (4) surfactant flame; (5) alumi-
num droplet flame. In the first stage, vaporization occurred on the
droplet surface and a vapor cloud was formed around the droplet.
The second stage is characterized by steady vaporization and burn-
ing of the droplet. This is similar to the classical burning behavior of
a single-component droplet. A distinct flame envelope was observed
and the droplet diameter decreased steadily with time, approxi-
mately following the classical d2 law. Near the end of the second
stage, strong oscillations were observed, which were caused by the
formation and growth of bubbles in the droplet. The bubbles are the
result of homogeneous nucleation of vapor phase, resulting in pres-
sure buildup and droplet micro-explosion [404]. The ejected par-
ticles and aggregates ignite and burn, thereby disturbing the
envelope flame. This is followed by combustion of surfactant or its
pyrolysis products. The final stage is marked by combustion of a

Pnanoscales, d-0.52 or d-0.13 law was obtained, depending on whether
d1.0 or d0.3 (cid:1) law of the particle burning time was employed. No uni-
versal law of flame speed exists for the entire range of particle sizes.
Recently, an attempt has been made to conduct a more advanced
analysis, in which the single particle combustion model is integrated
into computational fluid dynamics analysis [393]. Future work
should attempt to eliminate empiricism and external input parame-
ters such as ignition temperature and burning time from the analy-
sis. A full detailed chemical mechanism with treatment of radiation
heat transfer, multi-phase flow physics, and particle agglomeration
is likely to yield better predictions.

10. Additives to liquid propellants and fuels

PMetal nanoparticles may be added to liquid fuels and propellants
for any of a number of reasons. First, metals have higher volumetric
energy densities compared with many liquid fuels and propellants,
and can thus help to lower the volume and weight of the propulsion
system and increase the payload. Second, nanoparticles can improve
the ignition and combustion characteristics of the base fuel/propel-
lant and result in better ignition and burning properties [394]. Third,
nanoparticle-laden liquid propellants are less prone to leakage and
generally less susceptible to cracking, and are less sensitive to
impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge [37]. Prior studies have
considered a wide range of nanoparticle concentrations, with consis-
tencies ranging from nanofluids to gels and pastes.

10.1. Additives to liquid fuels

PNanoparticles can be added to enhance the ignition characteris-
tics of conventional fuels. Tyagi et al. [394] conducted one of the first
studies demonstrating the beneficial effects of adding metal nano-
particles to liquid fuels. Effects of aluminum and aluminum oxide
nanoparticles on ignition characteristics of diesel fuel were studied
over a temperature range of 688(cid:1)768 °C. Two different particle sizes
of 15 and 50 nm were considered. The particle volume fraction var-
ied in the range of 0.0(cid:1)0.5%. Particle-laden droplets were dropped
on a hot plate and the ignition probability was calculated based on
the number of droplets that ignited. The ignition probability of diesel
increased due to the addition of the nanoparticles. For example, at a
temperature of 708 °C, the ignition probability increased from 15 to
50%, when the concentration of nanoaluminum particles increased
from 0 to 0.5 vol.%. This was attributed to the enhancement of the

in nanofluid fuels.

PIn a more recent study [405], the burning behaviors of dilute and
dense suspensions were compared. Both boron and iron nanopar-
ticles were considered. For dilute suspensions (< 1%), the burning
characteristics were characterized by the simultaneous burning of
the droplet and particles. In dense nanosuspensions, most particles
burned as large agglomerate at a later stage when all the liquid fuel
had been consumed. In cases when the energy provided by the drop-
let flame was insufficient, the agglomerate did not burn. Incomplete
and slow combustion of large particle agglomerates thus remains a

Pmajor problem for slurry fuels with metal nanoparticles, especially
under dense loading conditions.

PStudies [406,407] have attempted to gain in-depth understand-
ing of evaporation of nanoparticle-laden fuels. Heptane fuel droplets
and aluminum nanoparticles were considered. The ambient temper-
ature was varied in the range of 100(cid:1)600 °C. Particle concentrations
up to 5 wt.% were considered. As in the studies discussed above, the
classical d2-law was observed for the nano-particle laden fuels for
conditions considered in this study. At low temperatures (< 300 °C),
aluminum nanoparticles were bonded by surfactant to form large
agglomerates, resulting in a compact shell that suppressed the

Pevaporation rate. At higher temperatures (> 400 °C), the surfactant
decomposed and smaller agglomerates and a porous shell was
formed. The evaporation rate was thus enhanced.

PRecently, considerable efforts have been made to quantify the
effect of the added nanoparticles on liquid fuel ignition and combus-
tion. Substantial enhancements in burning rates of ethanol have
been reported due to the addition of 80 nm aluminum particles
[408]. The burning rate increases as much as 140%, when the concen-
tration of 80 nm particles increases from 0 to 5 wt.%. This was attrib-
uted to strong radiation absorption of nanoparticles suspended
within the droplet.

PIn another recent study [409], ignition and combustion of hep-
tane droplets with aluminum nanoparticles was studied. Three dif-
ferent concentrations of 0.5, 2.5, and 5% were considered. Particles
were coated with oleaic acid. Fig. 77a shows the ignition delay of

of Elsevier).

Pheptane droplets as a function of temperature for different nanopar-
ticle concentrations [409]. The ignition delay is an exponential func-
tion of temperature, similar to pure heptane droplets. At relatively
low temperatures (600(cid:1)700 °C), the ignition delay decreased as the
concentration increased from 0 to 0.5%. The ignition delays of hep-
tane droplets with 2.5% and 5.0% nanoparticles were however
greater than those of pure heptane droplets. At higher temperatures
(750(cid:1)850 °C), the ignition delay of the n-Al/heptane droplets was
comparable to that of the pure heptane droplets. It is evident that
addition of metal nanoparticles does not always result in a reduction
in ignition delay.

PFig. 77b shows the burning times of heptane droplets for dif-
ferent nanoparticle concentrations [409]. At higher temperatures,
burning times of heptane droplets with 0.5% and 2.5% nanoparticle
loading are generally lower than those of pure heptane, with the
effect more noticeable at low temperatures (the latter trend is an
artifact arising from delayed ignition of droplet near the end of
the droplet life time). In order to understand the reason for faster
burning of nanofluid droplets, gasification rates were also studied.
Results suggested that at low temperatures (650(cid:1)700 °C), gasifica-
tion rates of 2.5% and 5% n-Al/heptane droplets was equal to or
slightly lower than those of pure heptane droplet. At higher

Ptemperatures, nanofluid droplets exhibited much higher gasifica-
tion rates. The presence of microexplosions and disruptive burning
was observed, and the droplet burning did not follow the classical
d2-law. Furthermore, there was almost no residue or agglomerated
nanoparticles.

PThese observations are contrary to the findings of Gan and Qiao
and appear to offer a solution to the agglomeration issue that has
plagued the slurry fuels. The lack of classical combustion stage was
attributed to bubble formation inside the droplet, due to easier drop-
let heat up in the presence of nanoparticles [409]. Also, the heteroge-
neous nature of the n-Al/heptane droplet provided nucleation sites
for vapor formation [409]. These facilitated micro-explosions at an
earlier stage and the classical combustion stage was thus not
observed [409]. This was also responsible for higher gasification
rates [409]. Furthermore, it was suggested that the presence of oleaic
acid was the reason for the absence of agglomerates. These factors
contributed to the overall reduction in burning time for nanofluid
droplets. Such novel strategies which accelerate and intensify
micro-explosions and minimize aggregation can render nanofluids
viable fuel candidates for next generation energy-conversion appli-
cations.

10.2. Additives to liquid propellants

POne of the main reasons for the addition of metal particles to
liquid propellants is to increase the specific impulse. Fig. 78
shows the effect of aluminum particles on the specific and den-
sity impulses of LH2/LOX propellant. The chamber pressure is
100 bar and the nozzle exit-to-throat area ratio is 45. Calcula-
tions were performed using the NASA Chemical Equilibrium with
Applications (CEA) program [314]. Note that the stoichiometric
O/F ratio is 8. For O/F ratios near the stoichiometric condition,
the specific impulse at a given O/F ratio decreases with increas-
ing particle loading density. An opposite trend is observed for
much lower O/F ratios. At the very best, the specific impulse
increases only marginally with the addition of metal particles.
The density impulse, however, always increases with increasing
particle loading density at a given O/F ratio.

PThe specific impulse can be expressed as [5]:

s

ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
Tc
MWp

;

Isp /

ð96Þ

where Tc is the chamber temperature and MWp the molecular weight
of combustion products. Addition of aluminum particles may result
in an increase in the combustion temperature. The molecular weight
of the product, however, increases due to the formation of alumina
particles. This is the primary reason for the observed reduction in
specific impulse at higher O/F ratios. Note that the stoichiometric O/
F ratio also decreases with increasing with particle loading density.
For a very low O/F ratio, the propellant composition thus moves
towards the stoichiometric state when particle loading density is
increased, thereby resulting in an increase in the specific impulse.
For most conditions, the net result is only a marginal increase or
even a reduction in the specific impulse. The density impulse, a
product of the propellant density and specific impulse, however,
always increases, since the density of aluminum particles is much
greater than that of the conventional propellant (Note that the den-
sity impulse decreases with decreasing O/F ratio due to lower fuel
density compared with oxidizer density). This results in a lower tank
mass and higher payload. Metal particles are thus attractive addi-
tives to liquid propellants, especially for volume-limited propulsion
applications.

PGelling agents can be added to liquid propellants to tune their
rheological properties. Gelling can be accomplished using inorganic
agents such as silicon dioxide [410] or cellulose-based derivatives

P[411]. Alternatively, metal nanoparticles can act as a gellant due to
their high specific surface area [412]. Gelling reduces the risk of leak-
age, while maintaining the possibility of pumping and throttling
[37]. Gelled propellants are not susceptible to cracking and are less
sensitive to impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge [37]. The
specific and density impulses of gelled propellants are comparable
to those of liquid propellants, but gelled propellants are more diffi-
cult to break up into droplets [37].

PPrior studies have quantified the theoretical gain in propulsive
performance of gelled propellants by the addition of metal particles.
Palaszewski et al. [413] explored the possibility of replacing the solid
rocket boosters and main propulsion system in the Space Transpor-
tation System (STS) with metalized gelled propulsion systems. The
specific impulse did not monotonically increase with increasing
metal loading density in the fuel. Loading densities corresponding to
the maximum specific impulse are 65%, 5(cid:1)10%, and 40% for H2/O2,
RP-1/O2, and NTO/MMH propellants, respectively [413]. Note that
these mixtures correspond to lower O/F ratios compared with those
of non-metallized propellants. This is consistent with the trend
shown in Fig. 78 that the O/F ratio corresponding to peak specific
impulse decreases with increasing metal loading density. For a given
booster size, a payload increase of »14(cid:1)35% was achieved using
O2/RP-1/Al and NTO/MMH/Al propellants. This was attributed to the
increase in density impulse of the propellant. No such benefit
was obtained for O2/H2/Al propellant, since the maximum specific
impulse was attained for a very low O/F ratio. As shown in Fig. 78b,

Pdensity impulse decreases with decreasing O/F ratio. Lowering the
O/F ratio thus offsets the payload gain obtained by the addition of
metal particles.

PNote that the actual gain is expected to be lower than the theo-
retically achievable, due to two-phase flow losses and other ineffi-
ciencies during combustion and expansion. It is therefore important
to quantify these losses and inefficiencies. The combustion of gelled
RP-1/O2 propellant with ultra-fine aluminum has been studied
experimentally in a rocket motor [414]. The gellant was fumed silica
powder of diameter less than 44 mm. The diameter of aluminum
nanoparticles was »100 nm. Three different metal loading densities
of 0, 5, and 55% were considered. The chamber pressure varied in
the range of 1.0(cid:1)2.8 MPa. The characteristic velocity (c*) was mea-
sured and c* efficiency was obtained. Of the three metal loading den-
sities, the propellant with 5% metal loading exhibited the highest c*
efficiency. Note that the study of Palaszewski et al. [413] suggests
that the propellant with 5(cid:1)10% metal loading offers the best specific
impulse. The propellant with 55% metal loading had a slightly lower
c* efficiency. This was attributed to the accumulation of condensed
phase material within the chamber and on nozzle exit wall, as well
as incomplete combustion of particles. A judicious choice of metal
loading density must be made based on the requirements. In addi-
tion to ideal performance metrics such as theoretical specific and
density impulses, effects of combustion inefficiencies and two-phase
flow losses must be considered.

PAs mentioned before, nanoparticles are attractive gelling agents
because of their high specific surface area; a separate gelling agent is
not required. Prior studies [412,415] have explored the effect of
metal nanoparticle additions on the combustion behavior of conven-
tional propellants. Fig. 79 shows the burning rate as a function of
pressure for nitromethane with fumed silica and nanoaluminum
particles [412]. The baseline particle size was 38 nm and particle
loading densities up to »15 wt.% were considered. The mixture was
packed in a quartz tube and the propellant strands were burned in
an optical pressure vessel. The burning rate of nitromethane is posi-
tively affected by the addition of nanoaluminum particles. For exam-
ple, at a pressure of 5 MPa, the burning rate increases by a factor of
four when the particle loading density increases from 0 to 12.5%.
This trend was attributed to the enhancement in the energy content
and thermal diffusivity of the mixture. Note that the burning rate
increases sharply at a loading density of »13% and the resulting
value is about an order of magnitude greater than the burning rate
of pure nitromethane. The sharp increase in the burning rate corre-
sponds to a transition in the consistency of the mixture from gel to

Pclay-like. Theoretical calculations suggest that the specific impulse is
also positively affected by the addition of metal nanoparticles.

PIn addition to metals, oxide nanoparticles and functionalized gra-
phene sheet (FGS) have been considered. Fig. 80 shows the burning
rate of nitromethane as a function of additive concentration for a
pressure of 5.24 MPa [415]. The additive concentration varied in the
range of 0(cid:1)0.6% and the enhancement of the burning rate is roughly
linearly proportional to the additive concentration. Silica and alu-
mina nanoparticles result in similar enhancement of the burning
rate. Functionalized graphene sheets, however, result in enhance-
ments as high as 175%. The obtained enhancements were attributed
to the thermal [416] and catalytic [417] effects. It should be noted
that addition of nanoparticles may cause an anomalous enhance-
ment in thermal conductivity [416] through mechanisms such as
nanolayering, Brownian motion, and ballistic heat transfer; the issue
of anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids is a much debated
topic and is beyond the scope of this paper. It is also logical to expect
that the surfaces of nanoparticles can act as a site for chemical reac-
tions to occur and thus enhance the reaction rate. The significance of
thermal and chemical effects should be investigated. Modeling and
simulations can be performed to determine dominant parameters
that control the burning rate and clearly elucidate the effect of metal
nanoparticles on combustion of propellants.

11. Metals with liquid oxidizers

11.1. Aluminum and water

PNovel energetic materials can be created by mixing metal nano-
particles and liquid oxidizers such as water. The reaction of metal,
such as aluminum, with water is given by
2Al C 3H2O ! Al2O3 C 3H2:

ð97Þ
PThe reaction is quite exothermic and the enthalpy of reaction is
813 kJ/mol of aluminum. The metal-water mixture is of particular
interest for underwater propulsion, since the oxidizer (water) need
not be carried on board [418]. The mixture is also attractive for space
propulsion and energy-conversion applications [419] and hydrogen
generation [14]. Fig. 81 shows the vacuum specific impulse of Al-H2O
propellants for different water concentrations. The chamber pressure
is 100 bar and the gas is assumed to be expanded to near vacuum
conditions. The calculated theoretical maximum vacuum specific
impulse is 360 s. Note that the actual impulse would be lower due to
inefficiencies associated with combustion and expansion processes.

PTheoretical analysis of combustion processes was later con-
ducted to gain insight into the underlying processes and deter-
mine the rate-controlling mechanism [422]. A multi-zone
theoretical framework was established to predict the burning
properties and flame structure by solving the conservation equa-
tions in each zone and enforcing the mass and energy continui-
ties at the interfacial boundaries. The ignition temperature and
burning time of nano-aluminum particles were input parameters
to the model. Particle aggregation and entrainment were
neglected in the first version of the model. The parameters that
dictate the burning rate were found to be thermal diffusivity,
enthalpy of combustion, ignition temperature, and burning time.
The predicted pressure exponent »0.3 falls within the experi-
mental data (0.27(cid:1)0.47). However,
the inverse relationship
between the burning rate and particle size could be reproduced
only by using a d2-law for the particle burning time. It was thus
speculated that mass diffusion across the oxide layers of the par-
ticles controls the burning rate of nanoaluminum and water mix-
tures and this is inconsistent with general observations on the
combustion of aluminum nanoparticles in oxidizing gas environ-
ments.

PThe model was therefore later refined to treat the effects of parti-
cle entrainment and agglomeration [423]. The particle size was cho-
sen to be 80 nm and the pressure range of concern was 1(cid:1)10 MPa.
The particle entrainment effect was characterized by the particle

sure effect stems from the pressure dependence of the burning
time and velocity of particles.

POne of the first studies on nanoaluminum-water combustion was
conducted by Ivanov et al. [420,421]. An experimental study was
performed to investigate the combustion of nanoaluminum-water
mixtures. The particle size was 120 nm. Gelling agent was reported
to be necessary to achieve self-sustained flame propagation. The
burning rate increased from 0.1 to 1.1 cm/s, when the pressure
increased from 0.1 to 7 MPa. The combustion efficiency was in the
range of 52.5(cid:1)62.5%. Incomplete combustion was attributed to par-
tial boiling-out of water from the reaction zone.

PSelf-sustained flame propagation of nanoaluminum and water
mixtures was later achieved without any gelling agent [27]. Fig. 82
shows the effect of pressure on the burning rate of nanoaluminum
and water mixtures for a particle size of 38 nm [27]. Particle diame-
ters were in the range of 38(cid:1)130 nm and the pressure range was
0.1(cid:1)10 MPa. The burning rate has a pressure dependence of the
form rb D apm, with an exponent of 0.47. Furthermore, the burning
rate is substantially greater than those of conventional monomolec-
ular energetic materials such as ADN and CL-20, demonstrating the
superior reactivity of the mixture. For the particle size range of con-
cern (38(cid:1)130 nm), the burning rate was inversely proportional to
particle size. It was speculated that both transport and chemistry
affect the burning behavior, but key mechanisms and parameters
were not understood at that time.

PFig. 83 shows the pressure exponent for different entrainment
indices, n [423]. For diffusion-controlled conditions, entrainment
causes the pressure exponent to increase from 0 to 0.5. A similar
trend is observed in the kinetic regime, although the corresponding
values exceed the diffusion counterparts by 0.5. The reaction zone
thickness increases and interfacial temperature gradient decreases
with increasing particle velocity (entrainment). This lowers the rate
of heat feedback to the preheat zone, thereby resulting in a lower
burning rate. As the water vapor velocity (which is the particle
velocity when fully entrained) depends on pressure (due to mass
conservation), the pressure exponent increases when entrainment is
considered. Note that the pressure exponent may depend on mix-
ture consistency, which can be altered by changing the particle size
[424] or the pH of the water [425]. For example, the pressure expo-
nent increases from 0.34 at pH D 6.16 to 0.68 at pH D 3.23, since the
consistency changes from a paste to a fluid. It is logical to expect
loosely packed particles to be more easily entrained by the gas flow,
so differences in measured pressure exponents may be attributed to
the particle entrainment phenomenon.

11.2. Aluminum and ice (ALICE)

POne of the main drawbacks of nano-aluminum and water mix-
ture is aging, which is caused by low-temperature reactions and
evaporation of water. This issue can be overcome by freezing the
water in the mixture [419]. The resulting aluminum-ice (ALICE) mix-
ture is a solid propellant characterized by relatively environmentally
benign exhaust products. Fig. 85 shows a comparison of the burning
rates of 80 nm aluminum-ice (ALICE) and aluminum-water mixtures
[426]. It is apparent that the burning behavior of ALICE mixture is
similar to that of aluminum-water mixture. The burning rate has a
pressure dependence of the form, rb D a pn. The pressure exponent, n,
of the ALICE mixture is 0.41, greater than that of the aluminum-
water counterpart (0.27). This is partly attributable to differences in
the combustion efficiencies of the two mixtures.

PIn order to determine the propulsive performance of the ALICE
propellant, laboratory-scale static fire motor experiments were con-
ducted for motors with three different combustion chamber diame-
ters of 1.91, 3.81, and 7.62 cm [426]. Both end burning and center-
perforated grain configurations were considered. For each configura-
tion and motor size, a post combustion chamber with a length of
7.62 cm was used. For center-perforated motors, the grain length
was 7.62 cm. Three different grain lengths of 3.81, 7.62, and 15.2 cm
were considered for end-burning motors. Two pressure transducers
were employed to monitor the pressure near the post combustion
chamber region. The graphite nozzle consisted of conical converging
and diverging sections. The latter had a contraction ratio of 10 and
divergence half-angle of 15 degrees. Ignition was achieved using a
commercially available model rocket. An OMEGA load cell was used
to measure the instantaneous thrust of the motor.

PTable 11 summarizes the propulsive performance of the ALICE
propellant [426]. The specific impulse increases with increasing motor
size, from 56 s for a 1.91 cm motor to 133 s for a 7.62 cm motor. These
values are substantially lower than theoretical values obtained using
the NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) program. The
combustion efficiency increased with increasing motor size, from 43%
at 1.91 cm to 69% at 7.62 cm. This suggests that incomplete combus-
tion was primarily responsible for the poor specific impulses seen in
the experiment. Incomplete combustion was attributed to low com-
bustion temperatures,
residence time, and particle
agglomeration. The study revealed some serious issues concerning
ALICE propellants; in order to make ALICE propellants viable for prac-
tical applications, efforts must be made to completely understand the

insufficient

for diffusion and kinetic controlled combustion mechanisms; multi-zone combustion
model and analysis (reprinted from [423] with permission of Elsevier).

PThe attractive forces may also cause nanoparticles to cluster and
agglomerate, especially at higher particle loading densities, so the
effect of agglomeration must be considered. Fig. 84 shows the effect
of pressure on the burning rate of stoichiometric aluminum-water
mixture containing 80 nm particles [423]. Different combustion
models are considered. For the kinetics model, predictions are
greater than the experimental data by a factor of as much as ten if
particle entrainment is not considered. More accurate results are
obtained when the entrainment index, n, is increased from 0.0 to
0.4. The diffusion model offers predictions that are in reasonably
good agreement with experimental data when both entrainment
and agglomeration of particles are considered. It is likely that the
inverse dependence of the burning rate on particle size is a result of
the combustion of particle agglomerates as opposed to original par-
ticles. A model of the agglomeration of nano-aluminum particles in
water vapor is therefore desired. Future works must explore the
effects of agglomeration and entrainment in more detail in an effort
to develop a predictive model of combustion. Efforts must be made
to remove empirical input parameters from the analysis.

11.3. Alternative formulations

PAnother important drawback of the nanoaluminum-water mix-
ture is the low active aluminum content, since the high oxide con-
tent of nanoparticles lowers the energy and hydrogen contents of
the mixture. One way to improve the active aluminum content and
energy density is by replacing a portion of the nanoaluminum par-
ticles with micron-sized particles [427], since the active aluminum
content of micron-sized particles is nearly 100%. The burning rate,
however, decreases by a factor of four when the loading density of
micron-sized particles reaches 80% [427]. This is not surprising since
the burning time of micron-sized particles is much greater than that
of nano-sized particles.

(813 kJ/mol). Consequently,

PThe addition of hydrogen peroxide increases the energy content
and burning rate of the mixture [428]. This is because the heat
of Al(cid:1)H2O2 reaction is 1388 kJ/mol, which is nearly twice that of
the specific
Al(cid:1)H2O counterpart
impulse increases by about 15 s when water is replaced by hydrogen
peroxide [428]. Substantial enhancement of the burning rate is also
observed [428(cid:1)430]. For a particle size of 38 nm and pressure of
3.65 MPa, the burning rate increases by a factor of five, as the H2O2
concentration increases from 0 to 32% [429]. Concentrations greater
than 35% were not considered in the experiments due to an anoma-
lous burning behavior characterized by over pressurization and rup-
ture of the quartz tube. Aluminum hydride is yet another additive
that can be used to enhance the hydrogen content and specific
impulse of nanoaluminum-water mixtures [419].

PAnother method by which the theoretical hydrogen yield of
metal-water mixtures can be increased is by using borohydride com-
pounds [14]. The reaction of aluminum and sodium borohydride
with water can be written as [14]
Al C 1:5H2O ! 0:5Al2O3 C 1:5H2

ð100Þ

NaBH4 C 2H2O ! NaBO2 C 4H2

ð101Þ
PThe enthalpy of the aluminum-water reaction is 409.1 kJ/mol,
the sodium borohydride-water reaction,
greater than that of
212.2 kJ/mol [14]. The burning rate is thus expected to decrease with
increasing sodium borohydride content in the mixture. The hydro-
gen yield of sodium borohydride-water reaction is 10.8 wt.%, nearly
twice that of the aluminum-water counterpart [14].

PAlternatively, magnesium particles can be used instead of alumi-
num particles [431]. The magnesium-water reaction is given by [431]
Mg C H2O ! MgO C H2

ð102Þ
PThe enthalpy of reaction and hydrogen yield are 315.4 kJ/mol and
4.76 wt.%, respectively, lower than those of aluminum-water mix-
tures [431]. The magnesium-water mixture, however, burned more

reaction (adapted from [432] with permission of Elsevier).

Pcompletely, resulting in better conversion efficiency [431]. Fig. 86
shows the effect of metal content on the hydrogen yield of the
sodium borohydride-water mixture [432]. The hydrogen yield
decreases with increasing metal content in the mixture. Further-
more, the hydrogen yields of micron-sized magnesium particles are
comparable to those of nanoaluminum particles. The combustion of
magnesium-water mixtures has been studied theoretically and
experimentally [433]. The flame speed is inversely proportional to
particle size and the burning rate is controlled by mass diffusion
through the gas-phase product layer surrounding the particles [433].

12. Additives to solid propellants

PMetal particles can be used to enhance the specific impulse of
composite solid propellants [4]. The composite solid propellant pri-
marily consists of a polymeric binder such as HTPB, oxidizer crys-
tals such as ammonium perchlorate (AP), and a metal fuel. Fig. 87
shows the effect of HTPB content on the specific impulse of AP/
HTPB/Al composite solid propellants for different Al loading densi-
ties. It is apparent that the maximum specific impulse is achieved
for a propellant with HTPB content of about 10%, Al content of
about 18%, and AP content of about 72%. The decomposition of AP
and reaction with HTPB produces gases consisting of carbon diox-
ide, water vapor, and hydrogen chloride [434]. Al particles react
with these product gases to increase the combustion temperature

Pand lower the gas molecular weight, thereby resulting in a higher
specific impulse [434].

PIt is important to understand the burning behavior of metal-
ized composite solid propellants. Particle size exerts a strong
effect on combustion of metalized composite solid propellants
and the burning rate can be enhanced by substituting nanoalu-
minum particles for micron-sized counterparts [435,436(cid:1)440].
Fig. 88 shows the effect of Al particle size on the burning rate of
AP/HTPB composite propellant for different pressures [440]. The
propellant consisted of 17% HTPB binder, 68% ammonium per-
chlorate, and 15% aluminum by weight. The burning rate is
nearly doubled when nanoaluminum particles are substituted for
micron-sized counterparts. This is not surprising, since alumi-
num nanoparticles have lower ignition temperatures and burning
times than micron-sized counterparts. Similar burning rate
enhancements using nanoparticles have been reported for other
solid propellants including RDX [441], GAP/AN, and HTPB/AP
mixtures [439,442]. Numerous studies suggest that the pressure
exponent in the burning rate law is not significantly affected by
the addition of nanoaluminum particles [17,443,444], while
some studies suggest lower pressure exponents at elevated pres-
sures [445,446]. A lower pressure exponent typically helps to
mitigate combustion instabilities in a rocket motor.

PIn order to further understand the reason for burning rate
enhancement through the addition of metal nanoparticles, studies
have been conducted to explore the particle burning mechanisms.
Fig. 89 shows photographs of combustion of aluminized AP/HTPB
solid propellant at a pressure of 10 bar [447]. For the propellant with
micron-sized particles, the aluminum particles are held in the pro-
pellant surface by the effects of surface tension imposed by the
binder, where they combine to form large agglomerates [448]. These
agglomerates have high ignition temperatures and burn far away
from the propellant surface. Particle agglomeration is substantially
lower for nanoparticles and particles burn relatively near the propel-
lant surface. This may be attributed to the low ignition temperatures
of aluminum nanoparticles. Nanoparticles thus provide better heat
feedback to the propellant surface and improve the burning rate
[448]. Fig. 90 shows scanning electron microscopy images of the
combustion products of a solid propellant for two different alumi-
num particle sizes, 30 mm and 150 nm [449]. For the nanocomposite
propellant, the maximum diameter of the oxide particles is around
6 mm. Although the final agglomerate size is reduced, agglomeration
remains an issue since the diameter of the condensed phase product
particle is micron-sized. As a result, the issue of two-phase flow
losses is not resolved. Note that while smaller agglomerates tend to

particles at a pressure of 10 bar [447].

Phave lower two-phase flow losses, particle damping of instabilities
is also reduced, especially at low pressures [18].

PA more detailed examination of the particle behavior near the
propellant surface is shown in Fig. 91 [18]. It is clear that particle
aggregation becomes a serious issue for propellants with alumi-
num nanoparticles. Another serious issue is the increased viscos-
ity of the propellant [24]. The high specific surface area of
nanoparticles (»10(cid:1)50 m2/g), can result in high propellant vis-
cosity and poor mechanical strength [25]. These can decrease
propellant density, produce erratic combustion, or even cause
motor failure [26]. Furthermore, the high oxide content at nano-
scales lowers the specific impulse significantly. For all these rea-
sons, nanoaluminum particles are not currently used in practical
solid propellant formulations, but there is growing interest in
the use of micron-sized particles with appropriate modifications
to mitigate the agglomeration phenomenon. Micron-sized par-
ticles offer important benefits over nanoparticles, including bet-
ter processability and high active metal content. It is however
essential to find ways to improve the reactivity of micron-sized
particles.

PThe reactivity of micron-sized particles can be increased by
activation [18]. Activation, which can be done mechanically or
chemically, can be used to increase the specific surface area of
micron-sized powders. Enhancement of specific surface area has
been achieved using a pitting corrosion procedure, involving a
solution of water and magnesium chloride [450]. The resulting
specific surface area was comparable to that of nanoparticles
(10(cid:1)18 m2/g) and enabled a good increase in reactivity [450]. The
higher reactivity further contributed to reduction in agglomerate
size [451]. Another approach is to replace the oxide layer with

Ptemperature, while generating more gas-phase products (to shatter
the particle) and fewer and smaller condensed phase product par-
ticles [26]. This would lower the two-phase flow losses. Another
option is multicomponent fuel particles with disparate boiling
points, such as aluminum-lithium alloys [454]. The lower boiling
point metal will boil first, causing particle expansion and eventual
shattering of the particle [454]. A yet another approach is to build
micron-sized particles that contain several nanoparticles and a suit-
able gas generator [455]. The gases generated during decomposition
of the gas generator facilitate disintegration of the micron-sized par-
ticles and minimize sintering of nanoparticles. As a result, composite
solid propellants based on these composite particles exhibit higher
burning rates compared to those with micron-sized particles and
reduced agglomerate size [455]. Future studies must attempt to tap
the benefits inherent at both nano and micron scales in an effort to
create propellants that are not only reactive and have low two-phase
flow losses, but are also easier to process and have high energy
content.

13. Nanothermites

PThermites are energetic materials consisting of metal and metal-
based oxide particles. Aluminum is the most commonly used metal,
while oxidizers such as MoO3, CuO, WO3, Fe2O3, and Bi2O3 have been
considered. Fundamental research on combustion of nanothermites
can be traced back to the study of Aumann et al. [456]. Flame propa-
gation velocities of Al/MoO3 nanothermites with average particle
sizes of 20(cid:1)50 nm were found to be orders of magnitude greater
than conventional thermites with micron-sized particles, and this
was attributed to reduced diffusion length scales as a result of inti-
mate contact at nano-scales. The study demonstrated the superior
reactivity of nanothermites and marked the beginning of extensive
research on these materials. Nanothermites not only feature high
energy densities, but the burning rates can be easily tuned by adjust-
ing fuel and oxidizer particle sizes, packing density, and composition
[457]. Nanothermites can be used as nontoxic primers for conven-
tional ammunitions [457], additives to solid propellants and explo-
sives [457], microthrusters [458], MEMS-based smart
ignition
systems [459], and so forth. In the following sections, studies on syn-
thesis, ignition, and combustion characteristics of nanothermites are
reviewed.

13.1. Synthesis

PThere are three methods commonly used to prepare nanother-
mites consisting of metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles: (1) physi-
cal mixing;
(3) sol-gel
(2) arrested reactive milling (ARM);
methodology. Physical mixing is the simplest method of preparing
nanothermites. In this method, metal and metal oxide nanopowders
are mixed in an inert volatile liquid and sonicated to ensure good
mixing and breakup of agglomerates [460,461]. The liquid is then
evaporated. This process can be used to synthesize nanocomposites
of various thermite systems [462,463]; some of its major disadvan-
tages are particle aggregation and the necessity of starting with
nanoscale powders.

PIn arrested reactive milling, metal and oxide particles are milled
in a ball or shaker mill [464]. A liquid such as hexane is added to the
mill for lubrication and cooling. The product typically consists of
particles in the size range of 1(cid:1)50 mm. These particles are composed
of 10(cid:1)100 nm thick layers of metal and metal oxide. Note that igni-
tion may occur during prolonged milling, but milling is stopped
before ignition, thereby arresting reactions and yielding a useable
thermite mixture. One of the main advantages of arrested reactive
milling is that the process yields fully dense materials [464]. Further-
more, the metal is not directly exposed to the ambient gas, so it has
low oxide content [465].

Al particles have lower ignition temperatures due to exothermic
intermetallic reactions. As a result, particle agglomeration can be
reduced [199].

POther novel approaches,

in addition to coatings, are being
explored to mitigate the agglomeration phenomenon. One such
approach is the inclusion of other materials, such as fluorocarbons,
in the aluminum particles [26,453]. The inclusion material must be
able to react exothermically with aluminum and lower the ignition

PSol-gel methodology, which is described in detail in Section 2.4,
takes advantage of the unique structural and mixing properties
available from sol-gel chemistry [1]. Metal particles reside in the
pores of an oxide matrix, facilitating enhanced reactivity [1,164]. An
important issue is the oxidation of the metal particles in water
[466]. This can be overcome by using sol-gel chemistry to prepare
oxide precursors and then physically mixing in metal particles [466].
This approach, however, results in reduced interfacial contact [466].

13.2. Ignition characteristics

PIgnition delay, an important property of concern, is a function of
the size of metal particles. Fig. 92 shows the effect of fuel particle
size on ignition delay of Al-MoO3 thermites [3]. The packing density
was 38% of the theoretical maximum density (TMD). Ignition was
achieved using a 50-W CO2 laser, and high-speed digital images
were used to determine the ignition time. Ignition delays of nano-
thermites are orders of magnitude lower than those of their micron
counterparts, demonstrating the enhanced reactivity at nano-scales.
Note that the ignition delay is weakly dependent on particle size at
nano-scales, perhaps due to high oxide content and aggregation of
nanoparticles.

PNumerous studies have been conducted to understand the igni-
tion mechanism of nano thermites. Fig. 93 shows a comparison of
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces of Al-MoO3 nanother-
mites prepared by physical mixing and arrested reactive milling
methods [467]. Heating rates varied in the range of 5(cid:1)40 K/min. For
ARM composites, a broad exothermic hump beginning at »500 K is
observed, whereas a narrower hump at a higher temperature is
observed for mixed nanopowders. It was proposed that oxygen gas
resulting from oxidizer decomposition escaped for mixed nanopow-
ders, but not for those prepared by arrested reactive milling due to
the fully dense nature of the composites. Reactions between oxygen
gas and aluminum particles were thus promoted, thereby resulting
in a lower onset temperature of exothermic reactions. A similar anal-
ysis was performed for Al-CuO nanothermites [223]. The proposed
reaction mechanism consists of decomposition of oxidizer particles
and release of oxygen gas, followed by mass diffusion across the
oxide layers of the aluminum particles. Ignition temperatures were
also measured by igniting powders in air on the surface of an electri-
cally heated metal filament. The resulting heating rates were in the
range of 103(cid:1)104 K/s, higher than those in DSC experiments. The
measured ignition temperatures were in the range of 650(cid:1)750 K,
over the heating rate range of concern.

PThe ignition mechanism of nanothermites has been explored
through simultaneous measurements of pressure and optical signals

Pfor CuO, SnO2, and Fe2O3 oxidizers [468]. The intention was to see if
there is any correlation between pressure (due to gas generation) and
optical signals. The diameters of the aluminum and oxide particles
were 50 nm and 100 nm, respectively. The powder was placed in a
combustion cell and a nichrome coil was placed in contact with the
top layer of the powder for ignition. Instrumentation consisted of
photo detectors and a piezoelectric pressure sensor. For CuO and SnO2
oxidizers, the pressure signal attained its peak value before the optical
signal. This appears to suggest that CuO and SnO2 decompose easily to
form gas-phase products. The reaction between the produced oxidiz-
ing gases and aluminum particles appeared to control the burning
rate. No such behavior was observed for the Al/Fe2O3 system, suggest-
ing that oxidizer decomposition could be the rate-limiting step.

PThe role of oxygen release in reactivity was further explored for
Al/CuO, Al/Fe2O3, and Al/ZnO nanothermites using a T-Jump/time-
of-flight mass (TOFMS) spectrometer [469]. Flash-heating experi-
ments with time-resolved mass spectrometry were performed with
heating rates on the order of 105 K/s. Among all the oxidizers consid-
ered, CuO released oxygen gas most readily and the Al/CuO mixture
also exhibited the highest pressurization rate. It appears that there
might be a correlation between the reactivity of the thermite and its
ability to release oxygen from oxidizer particles. Chemical equilib-
rium calculations suggest that CuO is stable up to a temperature of
750 K, whereas Fe2O3 decomposition occurs only at temperatures
exceeding 1100 K. The measured ignition temperatures of Al/CuO
and Al/ Fe2O3 thermites are 850 and 1100 K, respectively. A connec-
tion between oxidizer decomposition and ignition was thus pro-
posed. The proposed reaction mechanism is also in agreement with
the findings of Dreizin’s group.

PIt is apparent that gas production and subsequent reaction with
Al particles are of concern in the ignition of nanothermites. As nano-
particles are prone to sintering and aggregation, it is worth asking
whether condensed-phase reactions also contribute to ignition. The
importance of condensed phase reactions was investigated for sev-
eral nanoaluminum based thermites at high heating rates [208]. The
diameter of the aluminum particles was 50 nm and the size range of
of oxidizer particles was »50(cid:1)210 nm. Samples were heated rapidly
in situ within electron microscopes. Sintering of aggregated and/or
agglomerated particles was observed. High resolution image
sequences of thermites ignited on the Pt wire suggested that reactive
sintering contributed to rapid melting and coalescence of aggregated
particles. A new reactive sintering mechanism was thus proposed.
According to this mechanism, fuel and oxidizer aggregates come
into contact and condensed phase reactions begin at the interface.

PThe ensuing energy release is conducted away from the interface and
to adjacent particles in aggregate chains. As particles melt, capillary
and surface tension result in coalescences of aggregated particles.

POne of the open questions concerning the ignition mechanism of
nanothermites is the relative role of gas-solid and condensed phase
reactions. Recent studies [470,471] do indicate that reactive sintering
is an important component of combustion of nancomposite thermites.
Extensive efforts have been made to compare ignition temperatures
and oxygen/gas release temperatures of different thermites by con-
ducting T-jump rapid heating and oxygen/gas release experiments. A
good correlation between oxygen release from oxidizer and ignition
was observed for Al-CuO, Al-Fe2O3, and Al-AgIO3, and Al-KClO4.
Among all the systems considered, Al(cid:1)Bi2O3 and Al(cid:1)SnO2 ignited at
temperatures lower than the corresponding oxygen release tempera-
tures, while Al(cid:1)Co3O4 ignited above its oxygen release temperature.
Al(cid:1)MoO3, Al(cid:1)Sb2O3 and Al(cid:1)WO3, for which oxidizers did not release
any oxygen/gas, ignited as well, showing that oxygen/gas release is
not the sole deciding factor in initiation of reactions, at least for some
of the nanothermite systems. It was concluded that ignition before
oxygen release or without oxygen release is probably a result of direct
interfacial contact between fuel and oxidizer, leading to condensed
state mobility of reactive species. Future studies can attempt to gain
an in-depth understanding of both gas-release and condensed phase
reaction pathways, and develop models for ignition of nanothermites.

13.3. Combustion characteristics

PEarly studies suggested that the burning rate of thermites is neg-
atively affected by the substitution of nanoaluminum particles for
micron-sized particles [461]. This was attributed to the fact that
micron-thermites were exposed to the laser beam for a longer
period of time, resulting in significant preheating and higher burning
rates. Subsequent studies, however, have clearly shown that the
burning rate is enhanced by the addition of nanoparticles. The burn-
ing rate is typically measured by loosely packing the thermite in a
burn tube and then igniting it [472]. Photodetectors and pressure
sensors are commonly used to obtain optical and pressure signals
and a high speed camera is employed to record images of the burn-
ing process. Fig. 94 shows the effect of fuel particle size on the burn-
ing rate of Al-MoO3 thermites [472]. The powder density was
»5(cid:1)10% of the theoretical maximum density. The burning rate
increases with decreasing particle size and is independent of the
particle size below a threshold value in the range of 80(cid:1)110 nm.

PIn addition to fuel particle size, oxidizer particle size can have a
strong effect on the burning rate [473]. Fig. 95 shows the effect of fuel
and oxidizer particle sizes on the burning rate of Al/CuO and Al/MoO3
thermites [473]. Two different aluminum particle sizes of 38 nm and
2 mm were considered. The diameters of the nano and micron CuO
particles were 33 nm and 2.92 mm, respectively. The molybdenum tri-
oxide particles had a sheet-like morphology. The burning rate is great-
est for the mixture with nano-sized fuel and oxidizer particles.
Furthermore, composites with micron-sized aluminum and nano-sized
oxidizer particles have much higher burning rates than those with
nano-sized aluminum and micron-sized oxidizer particles. This was
attributed to the fact that the oxide layer constitutes a greater portion
of the mass of nanoaluminum particles, resulting in lower reaction
temperatures. Furthermore, thermites with nano-sized oxidizer par-
ticles have the ability to release oxygen more quickly and can thus
result in higher pressurization and burning rates. This is consistent
with the theory that ignition of CuO and MoO3 based thermites is pri-
marily caused by oxidizer decomposition and gas generation.

PExperimental studies have provided some insight into the com-
bustion mechanisms of nanothermites by monitoring pressure and
optical signals. In Bockman et al.’s study [472], measured peak val-
ues of pressure and pressurization rates of Al-MoO3 thermites sug-
gested that convection controls the propagation rate. A similar

Presult was obtained by Sanders et al. [474] for thermites with differ-
ent oxidizers, including CuO, MoO3, WO3, and Bi2O3. For all cases,
pressure and burning rate attained their respective peak value at the
same equivalence ratio. A similar correlation was however not
observed between reaction temperature and burning rate. This sug-
gests that flame propagation is likely not controlled by conduction
due to the presence of temperature gradient, but by convection due
to pressure variations within the thermite. The burning rate of nano-
thermites was found to be highest for fuel-rich conditions, with the
exception of Al/CuO mixture. This is in agreement with results of
other studies [461,472]. Chemical equilibrium calculations were per-
formed to understand the anomalous behavior of Al/CuO mixtures.
For Al/ MoO3 and Al/Bi2O3 mixtures, peak values of temperature and

Phigher pressures. At much higher pressures, the flame propagated
at a constant speed of »1 m/s, about three orders of magnitude
lower than the counterparts at low pressures. This was attributed
to the transition from convective to conductive flame propagation
mode.

PThe packing density is yet another parameter that affects the
burning rate and propagation mechanism of thermites. Fig. 97 shows
the effect of packing density on the burning rate of Al/MoO3 ther-
mites with nano- and micron-sized aluminum particles [476]. For
micron thermites, the burning rate increases with increasing pack-
ing density. Combustion of micron thermites is governed by heat
and mass diffusion phenomena [476]. The thermal diffusivity
increases with increasing packing density. Furthermore, the oxide
layer can be damaged in densely packed mixtures, thereby promot-
ing mass diffusion [476]. These promote the burning rate for denser
mixtures. For nanothermites, an opposite trend is observed, since
flame propagation is dictated by convection [476]. The resistance to
gas flow increases with increasing packing density, suppressing con-
vective flame propagation [476]. Similar trends have been reported
in Refs. [461] and [472]. Other factors that affect the burning rate
include preheating [477] and the presence of impurities [156]. Self-
sustained propagation in micro-channels, not achievable for conven-
tional thermites, has been observed for nanothermites owing to
their high reactivity [478].

PIn most experiments, the reactivity of nanothermites is charac-
terized by loosely packing the thermite in a tube, igniting it at one
end, and measuring the resulting burning rate. Caution must there-
fore be exercised when using the measured burning rates to obtain
burning time scales of nanothermites [479]. The burning rate is not
only a function of thermite reactivity, but also of other parameters
that aid the propagation of the flame front. As mentioned earlier,
under most conditions, flame propagation of nanothermites is
driven by gas generation, pressure buildup, and convection. In com-
bustion cells, the pressure is observed to rise on the order of a few
microseconds, but the light emission extends from hundreds of
microseconds to milliseconds [468]. As a result, it is difficult to
determine whether the mixture behind the flame front has burned
completely [468].

PThe traditional flame propagation experiments has therefore
been redesigned into an extended burn tube test in order to clarify
this point and directly infer burning time scales of nanothermites
[479]. The thermite was loosely and partially packed in the tube and
one end of the tube was closed. A steadily-propagating luminous

Pgas production were observed at equivalence ratios of 1.0 and
1.3(cid:1)1.4, respectively. As flame propagation is dictated by convec-
tion, it is not surprising that the burning rate attains its maximum
value at f D 1.3(cid:1)1.4. For Al/CuO mixture, both temperature and gas
production peaked near stoichiometric conditions.

PFurther insights into combustion mechanisms were obtained by
adding diluents such as aluminum oxide particles [475] or changing
the ambient pressure [462]. The oxide particles act as a diluent,
decreasing the flame temperature and inhibiting gas production.
Three different burning regimes were observed, depending on the
loading density of oxide particles: (1) steady regime up to 5%; (2)
accelerating regime at 10 and 15%; (3) unstable regime at 20% alu-
mina. The transition from steady to accelerating and unstable
regimes was attributed to the reduction in gas concentration,
thereby hindering the convective burning mode.

PAmbient pressure can also affect the propagation mode as well.
Fig. 96 shows the effect of pressure on the burning rate of Al/CuO
thermite in argon and helium gases [462]. The flame temperature
and gas concentration decreased with increasing pressure, altering
the flame propagation mechanism. Three modes of flame propaga-
tion were observed. At low pressures (0(cid:1)2 MPa), the flame propa-
gated at a constant velocity of »1000 m/s and the propagation rate
was dictated by convection. For argon, an accelerating regime was
observed over a pressure range of 2(cid:1)5 MPa. The corresponding
flame speed varied in the range of 100(cid:1)800 m/s. No such behavior
was observed for helium. An oscillating regime was observed at

Pfront was observed, which extended part, or all, of the way down the
length of the tube. For certain cases, the flame initially propagated
steadily, as evidenced by the linear trend in plot describing the tem-
poral evolution of the flame front location. At later times, the flame
speed began to decay and non-linearities were observed, suggesting
completion of reactions and quenching of the flame. The comple-
tion/quenching point was identified and the resulting quenching dis-
tance was calculated. The burning time was defined as the ratio
between the quenching distance and the steady-state burning rate.
The calculated burning time was independent of thermite mass and
tube dimensions and approached a constant value of 3.29 ms. This is
also comparable to the measured burning times of metal nanopar-
ticles in various oxidizing environments, and this suggests that the
obtained value is a good estimate of intrinsic reaction time scales of
nanothermites. Recent studies have shed light on heat transport
mechanisms during combustion of nanothermites. Specifically,
entrainment and convection of condensed phase species is thought
to play a critical role in heat transfer and flame propagation of nano-
thermites [480].

PExperimental studies have provided valuable insight on the com-
bustion of nanothermites. Theories on the combustion mechanisms
under different conditions have been proposed and the effects of dif-
ferent parameters on the burning rate have been determined. In
spite of these extensive efforts, however, only a global understand-
ing of nanothermite combustion has been achieved, and the under-
lying processes and mechanisms are not completely understood. It is
essential that the experiments be supported by high fidelity model-
ing and simulations to explain the experimental observations.
Firstly, the kinetics of nanothermite combustion needs to be deter-
mined, including oxidizer decomposition, condensed phase reac-
tions and metal particle combustion kinetics. This needs to be
combined with multi-phase flow models to accurately describe
flame propagation. Special efforts must be made to identify combus-
tion mechanisms and parameters that control the burning rate. The
role of different mechanisms such as heat conduction, radiation, and
convection of gases and condensed phase species can also be
explored in detail. This would enable us to control and improve the
reactivity of nanothermites.

13.4. Novel formulations

acid,

POne of the major drawbacks of conventional synthesis methods is
the formation of highly non-uniform and disorganized aggregates, as
shown in Fig. 5 [36]. Novel approaches to minimize aggregation and
non-uniformity are desired. In this regard, a bottom-up approach to
synthesize nanocomposite reactive microspheres using electrostatic
self-assembly of Al and CuO nanoparticles has been considered [36].
The diameter of the resulting microspheres was 1(cid:1)5 mm. The sur-
face of nanoaluminum particles was coated with v-functionalized
[COOH(CH2)10NMe3CCl-], while
alkanoic
that of CuO
particles was coated with v-functionalized alkanethiol [SH(CH2)10
COO-NMe4C]. The coated particles were then added to dimethyl sulf-
oxide solvent separately. When the two solutions were mixed
together, charge neutralization resulted in self-assembly and precipita-
tion of thermite microspheres. Fig. 98 shows scanning electron micros-
copy (SEM) images of thermite microspheres composed of nano-scale
Al and CuO particles [36]. Experimental results suggest that these mix-
tures ignite and permit self-sustained combustion in rectangular
micro-channels. This was not the case for thermites with conventional
particles. Other formulations considered include self-assembled CuO
nanorods and Al nanoparticles [458,481,482], porous Fe2O3 and Al
nanoparticles [483], silicon nanostructures or nanoporous silicon with
sodium perchlorate oxidizer [459,484], self-assembled Al and Bi2O3
nanoparticles [485], core-shell structured nanothermites [486], com-
posite oxide particles [487], nanothermite fibres [488].

14. Intermetallic systems

PExothermic reactions between metals are of concern in various
applications including joining materials [489],
igniting other
reactions [490], neutralizing biological materials [491], and material
synthesis [492,493]. Table 12 shows the heats of formation and
adiabatic reaction temperature of various intermetallic systems
[490,492,494]. The adiabatic reaction temperature is as high as
»3000 K, which demonstrates the high energy content of interme-
tallic systems. Of all the systems, the nickel-aluminum system has
received the vast majority of attention from the scientific commu-
nity, although there are studies on other systems as well [495(cid:1)498].

14.1. Multilayer foils

PThe materials of concern include multi-layered foils [499,500],
core-shell structured particles [501,502], and consolidated blends of
nickel and aluminum particles [501,502]. Multilayer foils have been
the subject of extensive investigation in the recent past and will be
the main focus here. Multilayer foils are typically fabricated either
by physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods, such as sputtering
[489] or electron beam evaporation [499], or by mechanical process-
ing techniques, such as rolling [503] or compacting of reactants into
a fully dense laminate [504]. The characteristic dimension is typi-
cally the total thickness of the two layers, referred to as the bilayer

Pthickness. Fig. 99 shows the SEM images of vapor-deposited and
mechanically processed Al/Ni multilayer foils [505]. As can be seen
in the figure, vapor deposition provides excellent control of the reac-
tant bilayer. The process is however quite time consuming and
expensive. Mechanically processed materials, on the other hand,
typically contain a range of bilayer thickness, but are preferred for
their quick turnaround and lower costs.

POne of the first studies on combustion of multilayer foils was con-
ducted by Dyer and Munir [499], who considered multi-layer Ni-Al
foils (atomic ratios of 1:1). Foils were prepared using electron beam
vaporization under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The layer thickness
was 150(cid:1)510 nm for aluminum and 100(cid:1)400 nm for nickel. Samples
contained 8(cid:1)30 layers and had an overall thickness of 5 mm. Ignition
was achieved using a tungsten coil in vacuum. The propagation

Pvelocity, measured using a camera, decreased with increasing layer
thickness, from »2 m/s at 200 nm to 0.75 m/s at 500 nm.

PAn important parameter that affects the propagation velocity is
the bilayer thickness. Fig. 100 shows the effect of bilayer thickness
on the propagation velocity of Ni-Al foils [505]. The propagation
velocity increases with decreasing bilayer thickness, from »2 m/s at
200 nm to »13 m/s at »19 nm. This was attributed to shorter diffu-
sion distances for thinner bilayers, enabling reactions to be com-
pleted quickly [505]. The propagation velocity decreased, however,
with further reduction in the bilayer thickness due to the loss of
chemical energy due to the interfacial premixing process [505]. For
foils with a range of bilayer thicknesses, as in mechanically proc-
essed materials, volume-averaged bilayer spacing is a good indicator
of foil reactivity [505].

PA number of studies have been conducted to explore the solid-
state reaction mechanisms of multilayer nanofoils for different heat-
ing rates. Fig. 101 shows DSC traces of Ni/Al multilayer foils for dif-
ferent bilayer thicknesses [506]. The heating rate is 40 °C/min. The
foil featured unequal Ni and Al layers, such that the expected final
product is Ni2Al3. Multiple peaks are observed for thicker bilayers
and the number of peaks decreases with decreasing bilayer thick-
ness. A similar trend has been reported elsewhere [505]. The study

Psuggested that the intermixed region near the interface consisted of
meta-stable Al9Ni2 phase, while the final phase of the foil was
Ni2Al3. In a subsequent study [507], the effect of heating rate on
phase transformations was explored. At low heating rates, (»1 K/s),
the phase transformation sequence was expressed as:

Al C Ni ! Al9Ni2 C Al C Ni ! Al3Ni C Al C Ni ! Al3Ni2:

ð103Þ
PThe proposed sequence is in agreement with study of Gavens
et al. [506]. At high heating rates (»106 K/s), the following sequence
was proposed:

Al C Ni ! AlðlÞ C AlNi ! Al3Ni2:

ð104Þ
PA notable difference is the absence of some intermetallic phases
and more direct precipitation of the final product. A similar conclu-
sion was obtained in a more recent study on equiatomic Ni-Al sys-
tem [508]. The proposed phase transformation sequence was
Al C Ni ! Al3Ni C Ni ! Al3Ni2 C Ni ! AlNi:

ð105Þ

PThe meta-stable Al9Ni2 phase was not observed. Increasing the
heating rate generally delays reactions, causes the exothermic peak
to shift to higher temperatures, and suppresses nucleation of inter-
mediate phases [508].

PStudies have attempted to explore the reaction mechanisms dur-
ing combustion of Ni/Al multilayer foils. Here, the heating rates are
quite high (105(cid:1)106 K/s) and temperatures as high as 1911 K could
be achieved. In theoretical studies [509], it is commonly assumed
that the Al and Ni layers are initially separated by a thin product
layer and reaction occurs by diffusion through the product layer. As
a result, the diffusion coefficient is an input parameter to the model.
Although there is quite an extensive database on diffusion coeffi-
cients for Ni/Al system [211,212,510(cid:1)513], there are considerable
uncertainties. Diffusion coefficients obtained using atomistic simula-
tions overestimate the propagation rate of Ni/Al multilayer foils
[509]. Also, formation of intermediate phases could alter the diffu-
sion coefficients [513]. Theoretical studies have not explored or con-
sidered reaction pathways in detail. The product layer is typically
assumed to be NiAl, although it is well known that other intermetal-
lic phases, liquid or solution mechanisms may be formed.

PExperimental studies have provided some unique insight into
the reaction mechanisms of Ni/Al multilayer foils by measuring
temperature profiles
the microstructure of
and studying
quenched samples. Fig. 102 shows the temperature-time profiles
for equiatomic Ni/Al multilayer samples for bilayer thickness of
50 nm [514]. The maximum combustion temperature is 1700 K,
which is greater than the melting point of Al (933 K) and near
(1728 K). A two-stage process is
the melting point of Ni
observed: the leading stage with an extremely rapid (»106 K/s)

layer foil with bilayer thickness of 50 nm indicating a two-stage reaction mechanism

Ptemperature rise, followed by a slower second stage. The study
proposed that the direct exothermic dissolution of nickel in the
molten aluminum layer controls the propagation rate. This is dif-
ferent from the reaction diffusion model used in theoretical stud-
ies, in which diffusion through the solid product layer controls
the propagation rate.

PRecent studies [515,516] have investigated the relative impor-
tance of the reaction-diffusion and dissolution mechanisms. Fig. 103
shows the three proposed mechanisms of combustion of Ni/Al multi-
layer foils [515]. The first two represent the reaction-diffusion and
dissolution mechanisms. The third is the new mechanism, referred
to as mosaic dissolution-precipitation mechanism. Here, the first
step is the dissolution of Ni atoms in the molten aluminum layer.
After saturation of the Al melt by Ni atoms, crystallites of the inter-
metallic product (NiAl) nucleate at the solid-liquid interface and
grow along the surface forming a mosaic layer, which consists of
solid NiAl grains separated by liquid solution. Further growth of the
NiAl crystals occurs via diffusion of Ni through the liquid channels
and precipitation at the intermetallic-melt interface. This mecha-
nism needs to be explored in more detail.

14.2. Particulate systems

PIn addition to multi-layer foils, particulate based systems have
also been explored [517]. The diameter of aluminum particles varied
in the range of 25 nm-20 mm and the diameter of nickel particles
was 1 mm. Emphasis was placed on measuring the ignition delay.

orders of magnitude lower than those of continuous foils. Such low
propagation velocities might be of concern for certain applications
such as chemical time delays and neutralization of biological or
chemical weapons [519].

15. Concluding remarks and future research

PMetals,

in the form of micron-sized particles, have been
employed in many propulsion and energy-conversion applications.
Micron-sized particles suffer from several drawbacks such as high
ignition temperatures and burning times, as well as particle agglom-
eration in solid rocket motor. As a result, energy release rates are
substantially diminished. Nanotechnology has created renewed
interest in metals due to the unique and favorable properties of
nanoparticles, which are attributed to their higher specific surface
area and excess energy of surface atoms. Tremendous progress has
been made in the synthesis of nanoparticles, but controlling the par-
ticle size, and minimizing cost and agglomeration during synthesis
remains a major challenge. Nanoparticles also suffer from several
drawbacks such as sintering and aggregation of particles, high oxide
content, processing and safety issues. Alternative passivation mate-
rials are being explored in an attempt to enhance the energy content,
lower the ignition temperature, and mitigate processing issues.

PThe physicochemical properties of metal nanoparticles have been
studied extensively. At nano-scales, particle properties are generally
size-dependent, and deviate substantially from those of the bulk. In
past studies, studies have attempted to elucidate the size depen-
dence of various properties including melting and boiling points,
enthalpy of combustion, and emissivity. Deviations from bulk values
are generally important at nano-scales, but more so for particle sizes
lower than 10 nm. Theoretical analyses also reveal some interesting
trends such as elevation of boiling points and reduction in enthalpy
of combustion, which have important implications on combustion
of metal nanoparticles. These trends however need to be verified

multilayered foils (adapted from [519] with permission of Elsevier).

PThe ignition delay of Ni-Al powder blend decreased by a factor of 10
when the particle size decreased from 20 mm to 25 nm. For mixtures
with nanoaluminum particles, flame speeds were in the range of
8(cid:1)6 mm/s, substantially lower than those of mixtures with micron-
sized particles (»62 mm/s). One possible reason for this is the high
oxide content in nanoparticles; the oxide layer acts as a heat sink
and retards flame propagation. Sintering and aggregation of particles
could be yet another factor. These problems may be overcome by
using core-shell structured particles [502,518] or particles with Ni/
Al multilayers within them [519]. Multilayer particles can be synthe-
sized by DC magnetron sputtering on a rotating nylon mesh with a
square weave, as shown in Fig. 104 [519]. The length of particles was
three times their width. Fig. 105 shows the effect of bilayer thickness
on the propagation velocity of loosely packed Ni-Al multilayered

Pexperimentally. Furthermore, it is important to consider the effect of
passivation layer on particle properties, as they not only alter the
surface properties, but could also influence the state of the entire
particle. Heating rate must also be given due attention when
describing dynamics of various phenomena including phase trans-
formations.

PIn spite of the work done in this field over the past two decades,
the ignition and behaviors of metal nanoparticles are not yet
completely understood. Most of the studies have focused on alumi-
num, and nanoparticles of other metals have received very limited
attention and further studies are required. Ignition temperatures of
aluminum nanoparticles are typically substantially lower than the
bulk melting point of the oxide layer (2350 K). There is, however,
considerable scatter in measured ignition temperatures, especially
for particle sizes on the order of (and lower than) »1(cid:1)10 mm. This is
partly due to the fact that that ignition temperature depends on vari-
ous parameters, including the nature of the oxidizing gas, oxidizer
concentration, particle size, oxide layer properties, and so forth. A
systematic study on the dependence of ignition temperature on
these parameters is much needed. The ignition mechanism of nano-
particles also remains an unsettled problem. Different ignition theo-
ries have been proposed including core melting and fracture of
oxide layer, polymorphic phase transformations of the oxide layer,
mass diffusion, and melting of the oxide layer. The thermomechani-
cal properties of the oxide layer are poorly understood; it is unclear
if the oxide layer is flexible/ductile or hard/rigid. Recent experiments
provide evidence of interesting phenomena such as relaxation of
pressure (generated due to heating and core melting), inhomoge-
neous polymorphic phase transformations, and cracking of oxide
layer at weak spots (corresponding to amorphous regions). These
experiments however correspond to restricted set of conditions
such as low heating rates and specific oxidizer compositions and
particle sizes. A complete picture of particle ignition is however not
yet attained. In this regard, the role played by different phenomena
such as core melting, polymorphic phase transformations, mass dif-
fusion, and oxide layer melting needs to be understood for a wide
range of conditions.

PA limited number of studies have attempted to characterize com-
bustion of metal nanoparticles. As with ignition, most of the studies
considered aluminum nanoparticles. Results of experimental and
theoretical studies reveal several unique burning properties of alu-
minum nanoparticles. The flame appears to be located at (or near)
the particle surface and the flame temperatures could be substan-
tially lower than the adiabatic counterparts (This appears to be the
case for other metals such as boron). At low pressures (near standard
atmospheric pressure), the combustion temperature is as low as the
ambient gas temperature. At higher pressures, combustion tempera-
tures as high as »3500 K are observed. Furthermore, AlO gas phase
emission is observed only for pressures greater than 20 atm. This
suggests that surface reactions are important for nanoparticles and
vapor-phase reactions may not always be negligible. The situation is
quite different for other oxidizers. For example, peaks temperatures
in carbon dioxide are approximately equal to the ambient gas tem-
peratures, regardless of the pressure. The relative importance of
vapor-phase and surface reactions is thus not fully understood and
needs to be investigated. The observed variations in combustion
temperature are explained based on free-molecular heat transfer
theory and considering low energy accommodation coefficients.
There is however no (or limited) reliable experimental data on
accommodation coefficients at high temperatures and pressures.
Experiments and high fidelity modeling and simulations can be used
to accurately determine accommodation coefficients for these condi-
tions. There is also considerable uncertainty in determining reaction
rates. If a collision-based reaction model is to be adopted, it is not
fully clear if reactions are occurring on the outer surface of the parti-
cle or at the core-shell interface. Furthermore, sticking probabilities

Pneeds to be determined to account for the fraction of collisions that
actually result in chemical reactions.

PWhereas the burning time of micron-sized particles depends pri-
marily on particle size and gas composition, the burning time of
nanoparticles is a strong function of the pressure and temperature of
the gas. Particle size, however, exerts a weak effect on the burning
time; the diameter exponent is significantly lower than unity. It is
generally believed that combustion of metal nanoparticles is con-
trolled by chemical kinetics and not by mass diffusion through the
gas-phase mixture. Comparison of gas-phase diffusion time scales
and measured burning times do support this argument. The integrity
of the oxide layer (and the resultant diffusion resistance) is not fully
understood; kinetics of mass diffusion and chemical reactions are
also poorly known. A direct comparison cannot be made to ascertain
the relative importance of chemical kinetics and mass diffusion
across the oxide layer. Measured burning times are as yet available
only for limited sets of conditions. Effects of pressure and oxidizer
on burning time need further investigation. The weak effect of parti-
cle size on the burning time, presently attributed to cracking of the
oxide layer and sintering and aggregation of particles, is poorly
understood. This issue needs to be resolved as well. Further meas-
urements, especially for pressures exceeding 32 atm, are necessary
to develop a correlation for the burning time of aluminum nanopar-
ticles. High-fidelity modeling and simulation of combustion of metal
particles should complement experiments to achieve a complete
understanding of the essential physics of the problem.

PStudies have shown that the reactivity of liquid fuels and propel-
lants can be enhanced by substituting nanoparticles for their
micron-sized counterparts. For liquids fuels, one of the major chal-
lenges is the agglomeration of nanoparticles; the agglomerate burn
slowly and incompletely after combustion of the liquid droplet,
especially for nanofluids with dense particle loading densities.
Recent experiment studies appear to offer some solutions to this
problem. One of the ways the agglomeration issue can perhaps be
mitigated is by taking advantage of the micro-explosion phenomena.
Appropriate surface coatings can also be considered. Future studies
must attempt to tackle the agglomeration issue to make nanofluid
fuels more viable fuel candidates.

PMetal nanoparticles can also be added to conventional liquid pro-
pellants to increase the specific impulse. It must be noted that addi-
tion of metal nanoparticles does not always increase the specific
impulse due to higher molecular weight of product particles. The
density impulse can be increased to enable more payloads. Note,
however, inefficiencies associated with combustion and expansion
typically tend to lower the impulse. Substantial gains in burning
rates have also been obtained due to the addition of metal nanopar-
ticles. This has been attributed to both thermal and catalytic effects,
but a full understanding is not achieved.

PIn addition, novel energetic materials consisting of metal
nanoparticles and liquid oxidizers (such as water) are being con-
sidered for propulsion, energy-conversion, and hydrogen-genera-
tion applications. Experimental studies offered some insight on
the combustion and propulsive performances, while theoretical
studies helped understand the underlying processes and mecha-
nisms. A frozen mixture of nano-aluminum and water (ALICE)
was also considered as a “green” refrigerated solid propellant.
Although the propellant features high burning rates in a strand
burner setup, the actual specific impulse in a lab-scale motor is
quite low due to inefficiencies associated with combustion and
expansion processes. Fundamental understanding of combustion
and multi-phase flow dynamics in the nozzle are necessary to
improve the performance.

POne of the major applications of metal nanoparticles is in a solid
propellant to increase the specific impulse. Addition of nanoparticles
results in an increase in the burning rate due to particle burning
near the propellant surface, thereby resulting in a better heat

Pfeedback. Although the problem of agglomeration is less severe, sin-
tering and aggregation is prevalent at nano-scales. As a result, two-
phase flow losses persist and potential benefits are not fully realized.
Furthermore, propellants with nanoparticles suffer from processing
and mechanical strength issues. As a result, there is a growing inter-
est in reconsidering micron-sized particles, but appropriate modifi-
cations to increase the reactivity and minimize agglomeration. The
approaches considered so far include nickel coating, inclusion of flu-
orocarbons, metal alloys, and gas generating polymers. Future works
must leverage the benefits of micron-sized particles and nanotech-
nology to engineer a solid propellant formulation that not only offers
high burning rates and impulses, but are also easier to process and
have no safety and strength issues. Modeling and simulations can
also be conducted to better understand the underlying processes,
especially the agglomeration phenomenon, to assist the develop-
ment of advanced propellant formulations.

PMetal nanoparticles are also used as an ingredient in ther-
mites. The ignition of nanothermites has been extensively stud-
ied. Early studies suggested that ignition of nanothermites is
primarily initiated by decomposition of oxidizer particles and
subsequent reaction between oxidizing gas and metal particles.
Recent studies however indicate that gas-condensed-phase reac-
tions are also important. One of the open questions is the relative
role of gas-phase and condensed phase reactions. The combustion
of nanothermites has been widely studied. These probed the
effects of fuel and oxidizer particle sizes, pressure, packing den-
sity, and diluents. Convection typically appears to be the rate-con-
trolling mechanism for flame propagation, whereas conduction
becomes important when gas generation and transport are sup-
pressed. While a crude picture of nanothermite combustion has
been achieved, full details of underlying processes have not been
obtained. Kinetics of condensed-phase reactions and oxidizer
decomposition needs to be established. This needs to be coupled
with multi-phase flow models to accurately describe flame propa-
gation. Special efforts must be made to identify combustion
mechanisms and parameters that control the burning rate. The
role of different mechanisms such as heat conduction, radiation,
and convection of gases and condensed phase species can also be
explored.

POf all intermetallic systems, multilayer foils have been exten-
sively studied. The variations of propagation velocity and enthalpy
of combustion with bilayer spacing is quite well described. Both low
and high heating experiments have been conducted to shed light on
the solid-state reaction pathways. Increasing the heating rate gener-
ally delays reactions, causes the exothermic peak to shift to higher
temperatures, and suppresses nucleation of intermediate phases.
Actual reaction mechanism during combustion of multilayer foils is
still being investigated. The proposed mechanisms include dissolu-
tion of Ni atoms in the molten aluminum layer, diffusion through
the solid product layer, and the mosaic dissolution-precipitation
mechanism. The latter consists of dissolution of Ni atoms followed
by precipitation of NiAl. Further diffusion occurs through the liquid
channels between NiAl grains. Modeling and simulations of combus-
tion of multilayer foils is also a challenge due to uncertainties in
reaction mechanism and parameters such as diffusion coefficients.
Future studies should attempt to address these issues in an effort to
fully understand the combustion mechanism and predict the propa-
gation rates for different conditions.
