Ozone addition is a promising method to enhance and control combustion and ignition processes. It can
be produced efficiently at atmospheric or elevated pressure conditions and its lifetime is sufficiently long
to allow for remote production and transport to reaction zones. Over the past decades, the effect of ozone
addition on ignition and combustion processes has been extensively studied from bench top fundamental
burners to practical internal combustion engines. Ozone has shown the capability to accelerate ignition
and control ignition timing, enhance flame propagation, improve flame stabilization, pre-process fuel to
modify emission and reactivity characteristics, and reduce certain pollutant formation. Such enhancement
is closely related to ozone chemistry, especially the decomposition of ozone to produce atomic oxygen
and the rapid exothermic ozonolysis reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons. The former requires el-
evated temperature to release atomic oxygen and initiate fuel/atomic oxygen reactions typically in the
preheat zone, while the latter initiates low temperature (even room temperature) direct fuel/ozone reac-
tions. These findings provide new opportunities in the development of strategies to enhance and control
combustion/ignition processes. This article provides a comprehensive review of the basic principles of
ozone enhanced reactive processes, including fundamental ozone chemistry, ozone generation and quan-
tification, and the progress in the study of ozone addition in combustion systems.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background and motivation

Combustion plays a vital role in civilian life, such as transporta-
tion and power generation. However, concerns of efficiency, emis-
sion,  and  operation  at  extreme  conditions  highlight  the  need  to
enhance  and  control  combustion  processes.  For  example,  to  in-
crease efficiency and reduce emissions for ground transportation
application, various new engine technologies have been developed,
such as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines
[1] and Partially Premixed Compression Ignition (PRCI) engines [2] .
However, the control of ignition timing is extremely difficult, and
it  becomes  necessary  to  develop  an  alternative  method  to  con-
trol the ignition process. For air transportation, in order to meet
stringent emission standards, new lean burn aircraft engines have
been developed, such as lean direct injection (LDI) [3] and trapped
vortex  lean  combustors  [4] .  Therefore,  flame  stabilization  strate-
gies are necessary to achieve stable combustion at such ultra-lean
conditions.  Another  example  is  high-speed  air-breathing  propul-
sion systems, such as supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) en-
gines. The short flow residence times in the engine requires en-
hancement and control of ignition and flame stabilization. If the
reaction  rates  of  limiting  reaction  steps  can  be  enhanced,  igni-
tion and combustion processes could be dramatically accelerated.
For ground power generation and industrial burners, driven by the
needs of NO x emission reduction and CO
2 capture, new techniques
such  as  flameless  combustion  [5,6]  and  oxy-fuel  [7]  combustion
have been developed. In these systems, combustion instability and
flame flashback are challenging issues, which also highlights the
need for novel combustion control techniques.

All  of  the  needs  with  regard  to  combustion  control  and  en-
hancement  elicit  both  challenges  and  opportunities.  To  provide
some context, recent developments on combustion control will be
briefly reviewed in the next section.

1.2. Combustion enhancement: challenges and opportunities

Facing the challenges discussed above, techniques for combus-
tion enhancement and control, either passive or active, have be-
come necessary. A survey of different methods is briefly reviewed
in this section.

1.2.1. Conventional passive and active control

Passive  control  methods  are  typically  based  on  geometrical
modification of combustors. Such concepts have been extensively
used to mitigate the combustion instabilities encountered in gas
turbine combustors [8] . One typical approach is to decouple the
periodic heat release and acoustic pressure oscillations so that they
are  not  in  phase  with  each  other.  An  example  is  the  Helmholtz

damper used to suppress acoustic fluctuations that feed in to com-
bustion instabilities [9] . Another approach is to maintain uniform
combustion  processes  by  promoting  small-scale  turbulence  and
hampering large-scale structures [8] .

Active  control  involves  an  actuator  which  can  affect  the  sys-
tem dynamically through a control unit. It can be categorized as
open-loop  or  closed-loop.  While  open-loop  control  can  provide
enhanced  level  of  operability,  closed-loop  control  utilizes  infor-
mation  feedback,  and  generally  allows  a  finer  tuning  of  operat-
ing conditions. This concept has been used in automotive engines
[10] for decades. Modern gas turbines operate near the lean sta-
bility  limit  to  reduce  emission.  However,  under  such  conditions,
a  small  change  in  operating  condition  (a  few  tens  of  Kelvin  (K)
of  temperature  change)  might  be  responsible  for  a  dramatic  in-
crease in pollutant formation [11] . Active control techniques have
been developed to mitigate these types of variations by precisely
controlling/adjusting  the  equivalence  ratio  in  gas  turbines.  How-
ever, the estimation of the air inflow to the combustor rate is diffi-
cult [12] necessitating more robust active control methods. Besides
emission control, combustion instability is another issue where ac-
tive control techniques have been applied. For example, one tech-
nique summarized in Ref. [13] uses a microphone to monitor the
pressure  fluctuations,  which  informs  a  controller  to  activate  an
acoustic driver to mitigate instabilities in the combustor. Regard-
ing the control and enhancement of combustion process, various
approaches  have  been  proposed.  Acoustic  forcing  was  proposed
to control [14] and stabilize [15] lifted non-premixed jet flames.
Vorticity production was used to enhance the fuel/oxidizer mix-
ing, thus promoting more complete combustion [16] . Additives and
plasma assisted combustion are two other promising means of en-
hancing combustion [17] .

1.2.2. Reactive species addition and other additives

Due to its low autoignition temperature ( ∼291 K) and sponta-
neous combustion when coming into contact with air (pyrophoric),
silane has been used to promote ignition in scramjet engines. Mor-
ris et al. [18] experimentally studied silane as a fuel additive to
promote  ignition  in  hydrogen-fueled  scramjets.  The  results  indi-
cated that blending as low as 2.5% silane in hydrogen was effective
for scramjets to operate at conditions where hydrogen alone could
not  combust.  However,  storage  and  handling  of  such  pyrophoric
fluids are extremely difficult and raise significant safety concerns.
Correspondingly,  Gerstein  and  Choudhury  [19]  proposed  a  “pro-
grammed  ignition” strategy  where  an  ignition  promoter  (silane)
and volatile diluent (liquid methane) were mixed first, and the liq-
uid mixture was sprayed into the combustion chamber upstream
of  the  main  fuel  (e.g.  hydrogen).  The  mixture  was  initially  non-
flammable and then underwent rapid methane vaporization, after
which the mixture became flammable.

Ignition promoters have also been applied in research using re-
newable fuels. Ethanol is a possible substitute for diesel fuels, how-
ever, it has a lower cetane number and high heat of vaporization.
The addition of an ignition promoter has been proposed as a po-
tential solution. Cipolat and Bhana [20–22] performed a series of
studies using dimethyl ether (DME) as the ignition promoter and
concluded that an ethanol/DME mixture can allow for engines to
achieve similar power as diesel fuel, but with considerably reduced
emissions. Besides diesel engines, DME has also been applied in
spark-ignited engines. Liang et al. [23] blended DME (1–2% volume
fractions) with ethanol and supplied the fuel mixture to a gaso-
line engine. It was found that DME addition increased the thermal
efficiency and the unburned hydrocarbon emissions were reduced.
However, one potential issue of the duel fuel strategy is the com-
plicated fueling system.

In recent years, the addition of reactive metallic nanoparticles
(NPs) to hydrocarbon fuels has drawn great interest for propulsion
systems. Liquid fuels with a stable suspension of NPs are some-
times referred to as nanofluid fuels [24] . Such NPs significantly in-
crease reactive interfacial area, as well as thermal and mass trans-
port properties. The energy stored in these metallic fuels can be
released rapidly by chemical reactions [24] . It has been shown that
the addition of such NPs can increase the volumetric energy den-
sity [25] and decrease ignition delay [26,27] , increase the burning
rate [28] , and catalyze fuel decomposition [29] . One drawback of
this method is the formation of metal particles after combustion.
For  more  detailed  review  of  related  studies,  the  readers  are  re-
ferred to Ref. [30] .

1.2.3. Plasma assisted combustion

Non-equilibrium plasma assisted combustion (PAC) has shown
promising potential for enhancing and controlling combustion pro-
cesses [17,31–33] . Plasma discharges may enhance the combustion
process via thermal, kinetic, and/or transport effects. Investigations
have shown its ability to enhance flame stabilization [34,35] and
ignition  [31,32] ,  as  well  as  reduce  soot  [36]  and  NO x  emissions
[37,38] .  Potential  applications  of  plasma  assisted  combustion  in-
clude supersonic propulsion and scramjet engines [39–42] , gaso-
line and diesel engines [43,44] , pulse detonation engines [45] , and
gas turbine engines [46,47] . One basic principle of plasma assisted
combustion is that reactive species produced from plasma, such as
atomic oxygen [4 8] , excited O
3 ) [50] , can en-
hance combustion processes. Besides the kinetic enhancement ef-
fect, the Joule heating from plasma causes thermal enhancement
of combustion processes, and the change of molecular structure of
fuels owing to fast plasma kinetics and its induced subsequent re-
actions also change the transport properties of the working fluid.
All of these enhancement mechanisms could couple with aerody-
namic effects to influence the entire combustion system [17,31,32] .
For more detailed reviews of plasma assisted combustion, the read-
ers are referred to Ref. [17,31,32] .

2 [4 9] and ozone (O

One  outstanding  challenge  of  the  plasma  assisted  combus-
tion technique is that the operating conditions of non-equilibrium
plasma and combustion systems are not well aligned. Most com-
bustion  systems  operate  at  elevated  pressure  conditions,  while
non-equilibrium  plasmas  favor  reduced  pressure  conditions,  typ-
ically below atmospheric pressure [51] . High pressure conditions
causes plasma thermal instability, non-uniform structure [51] , and
collisional  thermalization  of  the  discharge  [51] .  Therefore,  it  is
very  challenging  to  generate  a  uniform  large  volume  plasma  at
high  pressure  conditions.  At  the  same  time,  radicals  have  much
shorter lifetime at high pressures [52] , and thus they are generally
quenched before being transported to the reaction zone (if radi-
cal generation is not in situ ). Another issue which has not been
fully addressed in plasma assisted combustion systems is the po-
tential for increased NO concentration which has been observed

for  plasma  assisted  flames  when  compared  to  the  case  without
plasma [53,54] .

1.3. Ozone assisted combustion and history of ozone

The  difficulty  of  generating  stable,  uniform,  non-equilibrium
plasmas  at  high  pressures  can  be  mitigated  by  the  injection  of
long-lived,  plasma-produced  species.  One  promising  species  is
ozone. Ozone, or trioxygen (O
3 ), is a pale blue gas with a distinc-
tively pungent smell at room conditions. Properties of ozone have
been long studied [55] since it plays a vital role in our life in many
different  ways.  Ozone  in  the  stratosphere  (ozone  layer)  protects
earth from biologically-damaging ultraviolet radiation. On earth, it
is used in many industrial processes and as a disinfectant. Because
of its vigorous oxidizing properties, ozone can be toxic and dam-
age lungs and vital organs once inhaled [56] , and is considered a
pollutant at ground level because of being involved in the forma-
tion of photochemical smog. Furthermore, the reactions between
3 and alkenes may form photochemical air pollution [57,58] . Due
O
to these important issues, the kinetics of gas-phase reactions of O
3
has been extensively studied.

Ozone is one of the strongest oxidizers. It can be efficiently and
economically produced at high pressure conditions, which corre-
sponds  to  the  operating  condition  of  most  practical  combustion
devices. One advantage of O
3  is that it is produced from oxygen
molecules which is the oxidizer of almost all combustion systems.
Therefore, no additional storage of fluids or gases is needed. Ozone
has a very long lifetime of approximately 1500 min in quiescent air
at room temperature (298 K) and zero humidity [59] . Compared to
the time scales in most combustors, the lifetime of O
3  could be
long enough to be transported from remote production to the de-
sired combustion region to modify fuel oxidization pathways. Pre-
vious studies have shown that O
3 has the ability to accelerate ig-
nition [60–62] , enhance flame propagation [63–65] and flame sta-
bilization [66] , process fuel to modify the emissions [67] and re-
activity characteristics [68] , and reduce certain pollutant formation
[62,69] .

2. Review of ozone chemistry

An enormous number of reactions involving O

3 have been stud-
3  related reactions on the National
ied. For example, searching O
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Kinetic Database 1 re-
turns 1974 records for 719 different reactions, predominantly con-
tributed  by  the  atmospheric  chemistry  community.  However,  O
3
3 decomposition reactions) did not draw
related reactions (except O
much attention in the combustion community, as O
3 rarely exists
in a conventional combustion system.

2.1. Ozone decomposition reactions

3 assisted combustion [70–74] , one of the most
In the study of O
important roles that O
3  plays is through decomposition (reaction
(R1) ) to release atomic oxygen in the preheating zone of a flame,
therefore inducing early fuel oxidation. The reaction is
O 3 +M = O 2 +O + M

(R1)

where  M  stands  for  a  third-body  reactant  representing  all  colli-
sion  species.  The  rate  constant  of  this  reaction  has  been  exten-
sively studied. A summary of reaction rate constants of reaction
(R1)  from  different  studies  is  presented  in  Table  S1  in  the  Sup-
plementary Material, where A is the pre-exponential factor, n is a
dimensionless parameter, T is the temperature measured in K, R is
the universal gas constant, and E a is the activation energy.

reaction rate constants at 800 K calculated using different expres-
sions shows a standard deviation of 28% relative to their average
value.

2.2. Reactions with radicals

Besides the decomposition of O

with radicals that are expected to be important in combustion sys-
tems involving O

Fig. 1.  Pressure dependence of reaction rate coefficient of O 3 decomposition reac-
tion.

It  is  noteworthy  that  the  O

3  decomposition  reaction  is  a  bi-
molecular  reaction  at  its  low  pressure  limit  (expressed  as  (R1) )
and a unimolecular reaction only at its high pressure limit. So the
reaction  rate  constant  of  O
3  decomposition  reaction  depends  on
both temperature and pressure (away from its high pressure limit).
Starting from the high pressure limit, the rate coefficient decreases
with decreasing third body concentration [M] and the correspond-
ing representation of the reaction rate constant as a function of
[M] is termed as the “falloff” curve of the reaction. The pressure
3 decomposition could be de-
dependence of the rate constant of O
scribed by the Lindemann-Hinshelwood reaction scheme [75] and
calculated using the classical Troe formalism [75] . A Troe formal-
ism obtained from theoretical model (RRKM model) was presented
by Peukert et al. [76] , which is valid in a temperature range from
70 0 K  to  140 0 K  and  pressure  range  from  5  mbar  to  3 bar.  The
pressure dependence of O
3  decomposition reaction rate constant
is calculated at 900 K using this Troe formalism and is presented
in Fig. 1 . Experimental measurements of O
3  decomposition reac-
tion rate constants ( T = 887 K to 907 K; P = 0.097 bar to 0.49 bar)
from Peukert et al. [76] are also shown in Fig. 1 for comparison. It
can be seen that the experiments agree with the RRKM model rea-
sonably well. The results in Fig. 1 at pressures greater than 3 bar
are extrapolation and for demonstration only as the Troe formal-
ism is invalid beyond 3 bar according to Peukert et al. [76] . It can
be seen that the high pressure limit of O
3 decomposition occurs at
very high pressure (above 10 0 0 bar). Expression of the reaction rate
at the low pressure limit works well below approximately 5 bar.
However, if the working pressure is greater than 5 bar, Troe for-
malism should be used to calculate the reaction rate constant for
3 decomposition reac-
O
3 decomposition. The Troe formalism for O
tion adapted from Ref. [76] is included in an O
3 sub-mechanism in
the Supplementary Material. As a majority of studies/applications
of ozone occur well below the high pressure limit of O
3  decom-
3 at those condi-
position reaction owing to the short lifetime of O
tions, the values presented in Table S1 focus on rates well below its
high pressure limit. The O
3 decomposition reaction rate constant at
the high pressure limit is provided as the last entry of Table S1.

The reaction rate of (R1) may depend on the third-body col-
liding partner, M. The results listed in Table S1 are visualized in
Fig. S1 as a function of temperature in the Supplementary Mate-
rial. It shows that the overall deviation among different studies is
reasonably small, regardless of the different rate expressions. For

the results reported using N

For reaction ( R2 ), the earliest research may date back to 1962,
which only reported a kinetic rate. More recent works included ac-
tivation energy [77] . Recent works on reaction ( R2 ), and its tem-
perature dependent reaction rate constants are summarized in Ta-
ble S2 and plotted in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material.

For reaction ( R3 ), fewer studies have been conducted. The only
measurement reported was in 1980 by Howard and Finlayson-Pitts
[78] , with a value of 4.52 × 10 11  at 298 K. The temperature de-
pendence was not investigated. Reactions ( R4 )–( R6 ) are relatively
well studied, and their reaction rate constants from past studies
are summarized in Table S3, S4, and S5, respectively, in the Sup-
plementary Material. The temperature range at which reaction ( R4 )
was investigated is relatively narrow, except the work conducted
by Ju et al. [79] . The results are visualized in Fig. S3 for ( R4 ), Fig.
S4 for ( R5 ) and Fig. S5 for ( R6 ) in the Supplementary Material. The
deviations among existing results for ( R4 )–( R6 ) are relatively large.

2.3. Reactions of ozone with hydrocarbons

In the reactions between O

3 and hydrocarbons, there is a dra-
matic difference in the behavior of saturated hydrocarbons (alka-
nes) and unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes) [80] . While the di-
rect reactions between O
3 and alkanes is immeasurably slow and
therefore of little importance in many systems, reactions of alkenes
3  can  be  fast.  Alkenes  undergo  a  cycloaddition  of  ozone,
with  O
and this exothermic class of reactions is generally referred to as
“ozonolysis reactions” ( R7 ) where Q means heat release. While the
rate constants for these reactions have been extensively studied ei-
ther experimentally or computationally [81,82] , significant uncer-
tainties/unknowns  still  exist  in  detailed  reaction  pathways.  Such
information could be critical for its application in combustion sys-
tems, especially for the ozonolysis reaction.

The reaction between O

4 (an alkane) is very slow (the
reaction  rate  constant  at  300 K  is  0.99  cm 3 /mol  s  [83] ),  so  it  is
normally ignored by the combustion community. However, the di-

rect reaction between O

ders of magnitude faster compared to that with CH
4 [80,84] (reac-
tion rate constant at 300 K is 1.12 × 10 6 cm 3 /mol s [85] ). The reac-
tion rate constants of these reactions between fuel and O
3  have
been  studied  for  several  different  hydrocarbons,  as  summarized
in Table 1 . For these components, the reaction rate constants for
alkenes  are  approximately  a  million  times  larger  than  those  for
alkanes.  For  these  alkenes,  the  molecular  structures  significantly

reactions.

The parameters showing the temperature dependence of the re-
actions for  alkanes are listed in Table S6 and the  corresponding
reaction rate constants are plotted in Fig. S6 in the Supplemen-
tary Material. The measurements were typically conducted within
a very narrow temperature range. For CH
4 , the results reported by
Stedman and Niki [88] is approximately 10 0 0 times faster than the
results by Dillemuth et al. [89] or Schubert et al. [83] . In a recent
experiment conducted [64] , the smaller reaction rate constant was
indirectly supported.

The reactions rate parameters for alkenes are listed in Tables
S7–S9 and the corresponding reaction rate constants are plotted in
Figs. S7–S9, respectively, in the Supplementary Material. For C
4 ,
the averaged value of reaction rate constant at 298 K using the re-
ported results/expressions is 1.1 × 10 6  cm 3 /mol s, and the stan-
dard deviation among different studies at this temperature is 28%.
If only results from studies after 1980 are considered, the deviation
decreases to 11% and the average value is 1.0 × 10 6 cm 3 /mol s. For
6 , the averaged value is 7.1 × 10 6 cm 3 /mol s at 298 K, and the
3 H
C
standard deviation is 15.6%. The result from Adeniji et al. [90] de-
viated from the average value the most. If this result is not consid-
ered, the deviation decreases to 9.5% of the average value, which is
6.7 × 10 6 cm 3 /mol s at 298 K. As the number of carbon atoms fur-
ther increases, the ozonolysis reactions become very complex and
the reaction rate constants from different studies also deviate more
significantly. For butene, the molecular structure becomes an im-
portant factor. The ozonolysis reaction rate constants of iso-C
4 H
8
and  1-C
8  and  cis-2-
8  are  similar  while  those  for  trans-2-C
8 ozonolysis reactions are approximately 10 times faster (refer
C
to Table S9 in the Supplementary Material).
As the direct reactions between O

3  and alkanes are generally
very  slow  at  room  temperature  and  can  be  neglected,  only  the
ozonolysis  reactions  of  alkenes  will  be  discussed  here.  A  well-
known  ozonolysis  mechanism  was  proposed  in  1975  by  Criegee

In the case of C

4 , the carbonyl compound is CH

[91] for alkenes. The first step is a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of O
3
to the alkene. In this step, combining with O
3 , the double carbon-
carbon bond is broken and a 5-member cyclic structure is formed.
This  product  is  called  primary  ozonide  (POZ),  which  is  typically
not collisionally stabilized under atmospheric conditions [92] and
subject  to  decomposition.  The  decomposition  of  POZ  produces  a
Criegee intermediate (a carbonyl oxide) and a carbonyl compound.
The Criegee intermediate is in an excited state. In gas phase, ap-
proximately 50% of Criegee intermediates can be stabilized through
collisions and approximately 50% of Criegee intermediates are sub-
ject to decomposition and reaction with other hydrocarbon species,
for example in the ozonolysis process of C
4  [93] . The process
mentioned above is summarized in Fig. 2 .

rect  detection  of  Criegee  intermediate  is  very  challenging,  espe-
cially  at  elevated  pressure  conditions.  Recently,  there  has  been
significant progress in the measurement of Criegee intermediates
at  reduced  pressure  conditions.  In  2008,  Taatjes  et  al.  [95]  re-
ported direct observation of Criegee intermediates in the oxidation
process of dimethyl sulfoxide (CH
3 ) using photoionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The oxidation process was pho-
tolytically initiated by a pulsed laser to produce Chlorine atoms.

In a later work, Welz et al. [96] used photolysis of CH
2
to generate CH
2 OO directly using photoion-
ization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Su et al. [97] presented
the infrared absorption spectrum of CH
2 OO produced from photol-
ysis of CH
2  at 12.5 kPa. Recently, a method has been ex-
perimentally demonstrated by Berndt et al. [98] to detect Criegee
intermediates  directly  from  ozonolysis  reactions  at  near  atmo-
spheric  conditions  using  chemical  ionization  mass  spectrometry.

The subsequent reactions after  the  decomposition of  POZ  are
still not very clear because of their complexity even though various
pathways have been proposed. Criegee suggests that the Criegee
intermediate  and  the  carbonyl  compound  could  recombine  and
yield a secondary ozonide (SOZ), with a different molecular struc-
ture than POZ. More recent investigations suggest that the excited
state  Criegee  intermediate  formed  in  the  POZ  cleavage  may  de-
compose unimolecularly [92,94,102] in addition to collisional sta-
bilization.  Several  pathways  for  this  unimolecular  decomposition
reaction of the Criegee intermediate have been proposed as sum-
marized in Ref. [94] : (1) the ester channel, which forms dioxirane
and subsequently decomposes into simpler species, (2) the forma-
tion of an OH radical via H migration, and (3) the split-off of O( 3 P)
atoms. The relative branching fractions of decomposition of Criegee
intermediates are predicted to be pressure dependent [92] . As the
products of these channels are highly reactive, secondary reactions

can be initiated and large uncertainties can be introduced, which
complicates  the  investigation  of  ozonolysis.  Horie  and  Moortgat
[103] conducted experiments at 101.1 kPa ( ∼1 bar) and 297 K using
a continuously-stirred tank-reactor and determined the branching

2.4. Reactions with pollutants

Ozone has been investigated as a reagent to remove NO x [107–
109] . In most practical flue gas, NO is the major NO x  species. A
general method is to convert NO, which has low solubility, to a
species that is highly soluble in water, such as NO
5 .
The water soluble species can then be captured later downstream.

ized in Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Material, and relatively small
variability is observed.

3. Generation and measurement of ozone

3.1. Ozone generation techniques

One technique for O

3 production is through the interaction of
2 with light in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range. The mech-
O
anism is responsible for the formation of the O
3  layer in the at-
mosphere. Conventionally, a UV lamp ( ∼100 nm to 260 nm) can be
used in such O

3 generators.

O

3  can  also  be  produced  by  electrical  discharge,  for  example
from lightning during a thunderstorm. Most commercial O
3  gen-
erators are based on electrical discharges. An electrical discharge
(typically corona discharge or dielectric barrier discharge to main-
tain low gas temperatures and minimize O
3 decomposition) is used
2 ,  therefore,  producing  atomic
to  break  the  molecular  bond  of  O
oxygen, which then recombines with O
3 via the reac-
tion O + O
3 + M. A relatively high pressure is preferred
3  formation  as  it  is  a  three-body  reaction.  Modern  high-
for  O
power O
3 generators take advantage of semiconductors to generate
square-wave currents or specially formed wave trains with a rep-
etition rate of 0.5–5 kHz. Ozone concentrations up to 5 wt% from
air and up to 18 wt% from oxygen can be reached [112] . Large scale
O
3 generators with production up to 100 kg/h have been built for
industrial applications. With modern technology, ozone can be pro-
duced for less than $2/kg [112] .

Simek and Clupek [113] experimentally studied the efficiency of
3 production by a pulsed discharge in air. The energy needed to

at different air flow rates and O
3 concentrations. Ozone yield var-
ied in a range of 15–55 g/kWh. Samaranayake et al. [114] reported
3  yield  of  10–110 g/kWh,  with  a  non-monotonic  trend  depend-
O
3  concentration.  Based  on  the  authors’  estimation  from
ing  on  O
the specification data available [115] , the O
3 yield for some com-
mercial O
3 generators based on pulsed discharges is approximately
67–125 g/kWh, on a similar order of the values reported in Refs.
[113,114] . These measurements of O
3 yield (mass per energy input)
suggest that approximately 3 × 10 7 –3 × 10 8 J of energy is needed
3 . For comparison, the difference be-
for the production of 1 kg of O
3 is 3.0 × 10 6 J at
tween the enthalpy of 1 kg of O
300 K and 101 kPa, which means only 1–10% of the total consumed
3 . To improve the efficiency

of O
3 production, experimental studies have been conducted con-
cerning the electrode arrangements [116–118] , dielectric materials
[119] , structure of discharge tube, feed-gas type (dried air or O
2 )
[119] , feed-gas flow rate [120] , operating pressure [120,121] , power
supply frequency [121] , and humidity [121] .

the O

3 arises because the recombination reaction takes approximately
O
10 μs in O
2 and 100 μs in air, allowing for a competition of differ-
ent pathways for O consumption [122] . The production of N atoms
from the discharge is potentially more critical for NO x production
2  = NO + O reaction is orders of magnitude faster
as the N + O
than the O + N
2 is in the ground state.
Therefore, the rate controlling step of NO x production in electrical
2 is in the discharge
discharges is the production of N atoms. If N
gas, the production of NO x cannot be avoided [123] . The trace com-
pounds can interfere with O
3  formation and when they  reach a
certain concentration, O
3 generation completely breaks down. This
“ozoneless” mode of discharge is referred to as the state of dis-
3 and NO x is sensi-
charge poisoning [124] . The reaction between O
tive to temperature, and therefore such effects can be reduced by

tion can be optimized in electrical discharge by providing electrons
in a suitable energy range of a few electronvolts to reduce energy

measurement is being performed in order to provide the most pre-
cise concentration measurement. An uncertainty of approximately
2% and a minimum detectable threshold of approximately 15 ppm
were reported in Ref. [63] . Commercial O
3 monitors applying the
same principle to measure O
3  concentration are available on the
market, as employed in the works [64,65,135] .

4.1. The effect of ozone on ignition: from benchtop to real engines

3.2. Ozone measurement techniques

Ozone has strong absorption bands from UV to the IR region
[128–130] . Therefore, a typical technique for ozone quantification
is the absorption method. In Ref. [63] , a mercury lamp was used
to  provide  UV  at  the  wavelength  of  253.7 nm  where  O
3  has  a
peak absorption cross section of 1.137 × 10 17 cm 2 at 300 K [131] ,
then the O
3 concentration was determined using the Beer–Lambert
law  [132] .  A  continuous  wave  deuterium  lamp  together  with  a
monochromator can be used to perform O
3  measurement at dif-
ferent  wavelengths  (195–345 nm  across  the  Hartley  and  Huggins
bands)  [128] .  Absorption  cross-sections  at  different  wavelengths
have been well characterized at different temperature conditions
[128,129,131,133] .  Reuter  et  al.  [130]  conducted  O
3  measurement
using absorption spectroscopy in both the UV and IR wavelengths.
In the first method, a deuterium lamp which emits a broadband
spectrum of UV light in the range from 200 to 300 nm was used
as background source. An interference filter with a central trans-
mission wavelength of 254 nm with full width at half maximum
(FWHM) of 10 nm was used to produce light around 254 nm. An
ICCD  camera  connected  to  a  spectrometer  served  as  the  detec-
tor.  Ozone  concentration  around  a  plasma  jet  was  then  calcu-
lated  based  on  the  absorption  spectrum.  In  the  second  method,
a  quantum  cascade  laser  in  the  mid-IR  region  (center  frequency
1027 cm −1 = 9737.1 nm) was used as the light source. Ozone mea-
surement was demonstrated in a 60 cm multipass white cell. Since
the quantum cascade laser has fine spectral resolution, a more ac-
curate measurement of O
3 concentration was obtained using mid-
IR absorption spectroscopy. Teranishi et al. [134] investigated mea-
surement of O
3 concentration using absorption spectroscopy in the
visible light region. Ozone has photon absorption band in the vis-
ible wavelength region around 450–850 nm, which is referred to
as the Chappuis band, the peak cross-section of which is approxi-
mately 20 0 0 times smaller than that of the Hartley band. In their
work, an LED having an emission peak at 609 nm and a photodiode
sensitive at visible light frequencies was used as the light source
and  the  photodetector,  respectively.  The  measurement  was  con-
ducted in a stainless-steel absorption optical cell. Good agreement
between measurement based on the visible absorption method and
UV ozone monitor was reported.

It  is  noteworthy  that  most  absorption  spectroscopy  measure-
ments  of  ozone  concentration  using  broadband  UV  light  sources
has the potential to simultaneously photolytically produce ozone
because  of  several  strong  UV  absorption  bands. When  using  ab-
sorption  spectroscopy,  care  has  to  be  taken  to  minimize  wave-
lengths  other  than  the  wavelength  range  where  the  absorption

3 . The photolysis of one O

3  assisted combustion focused on ignition.
Photolysis of O
3 could yield atomic oxygen and therefore was pro-
posed to enhance ignition. In 1987, Lucas et al. [136] conducted
experiments in closed aluminum cells with Plexiglas side windows
3  with KrF excimer laser (248 nm) to
using a mixture of H
3 molecule could pro-
photo dissociate O
2  molecule with 90% of atomic
duce one oxygen atom and one O
oxygen  in  the  electronic  excited  ( 1 D)  state  and  O
2  molecules  in
the  electronic  ( 1 (cid:2))  state.  O( 1 D)  is  extremely  reactive,  especially
with  species  like  H
2  with  zero  activation  energy.  The  effects  of
equivalence ratio, pressure, and initial gas temperature on the min-
imum  ozone  concentration  needed  to  produce  ignition  were  in-
vestigated. All the experiments were conducted at reduced pres-
sure  conditions  below  13.3 kPa  and  it  was  found  that  only  the
initial temperature had a significant effect on the required mini-
mum ozone concentration for ignition. With the increase of initial
temperature, the required minimum ozone concentration for igni-
tion decreased. Numerical modeling also showed that ignition was
not due solely to thermal effects, but was strongly dependent on
the number and type of radicals present initially after photolysis
[136] . Similar photolysis experiment was conducted by Liu et al.
[137]  in  1998  under  atmospheric  pressure  using  a  pipe  burner
with 6 mm inner diameter. The minimum incident laser energy in-
tensity (MILEI) from a KrF excimer laser (248 nm) was measured
3 /Ar mixtures. An ozone generation de-
for the ignition of H
2 flow controller and it was
vice was placed downstream of the O
found that the MILEI decreased with the increase of O
3  concen-
tration. The authors further conducted photolysis ignition experi-
ments using ArF laser (193 nm) to dissociate O
2 /Ar mix-
tures  and  compared  schlieren  photographs  of  ignition  processes
with  those  from  H
3 /Ar  mixtures  (illustrated  in  Fig.  3 ).  A
large difference was observed between their flame kernel growth

Early work on ozone decomposition flames include those from
Lewis and von Elbe [147] , Hirschfelder et al. [148] , von Karman and
Penner [149] in the 1930s–50s by employing steady state approx-
imations of atomic oxygen to solve the governing equations. More
detailed  studies  were  performed  in  the  1970s.  Wilde  [150]  con-
ducted laminar flame speed calculations using three different O
3
decomposition  kinetic  models  and  compared  with  experimental
measurements.  He  showed  that  the  flame  speeds  calculated  us-
ing  different  kinetic  models  varied  significantly  from  60 cm/s  to
152 cm/s for an O
2 (mole ratio 28/72) mixture while the exper-
imental measurement was 52 cm/s at atmospheric pressure. Cra-
marossa  and  Dixon-Lewis  [72]  solved  time-dependent  heat  con-
duction  and  diffusion  equations  for  a  number  of  ozone  decom-
position flames with different initial ozone mole fractions. Signif-
icant  deviation  between  computations  and  experiments  was  ob-
served. The authors suspected both deficiencies in the reaction ki-
netic model and the quenching effects in the ozone flame experi-
ments because of the small diameter of the experimental appara-
tus. In a later work by Warnatz [146] , time-dependent conservation
equations of a laminar flat ozone decomposition flame was solved
including complete multicomponent formulations of diffusion and

In 1988, Nomaguchi and Koda [138] investigated spark ignition
using electric pulses in a closed vessel at reduced pressure for pre-
mixed fuel (CH
3 OH) and ozonized air. It was found that
the minimum spark pulse duration for successful ignition could be
shortened considerably by adding 0.2% O
2 . Simulations con-
ducted  at  an  initial  temperature  of  1100 K,  and  a  constant  pres-
sure of 20.0 kPa corresponding to their experiments showed that
the acceleration of ignition was due to the atomic oxygen (from
3 decomposition) attacking fuel molecules. Later, Tachibana et al.
O
[62] used a diesel CFR engine to examine the effect of O
3  addi-
tion on compression ignition. O
3 addition accelerated ignition, in-
creased cetane number, and lowered the compression ratio of the
ignition limit. These observations were consistent with the work
by Nomaguchi and Koda [138] . The findings on ignition inspired
researchers  to  develop  O
3  addition  as  an  ignition  control  tech-
nique.  Such  an  attempt  was  proposed  in  a  patent  [139]  filed  in

of O
3 addition as a way to control ignition was later investigated
by Nishida and Tachibana [140] in 2006 on an HCCI system us-
ing  natural  gas  as  the  fuel.  Ignition  timing  and  combustion  du-
ration in HCCI engines are governed by chemical kinetics, not by
spark or injection, and thus techniques to control ignition timing
are essential. Nishida and Tachibana [140] carried out a numeri-
cal analysis, showing the feasibility of controlling ignition timing

by varying the amount of O
also experimentally showed that addition of ∼1200 ppm O
3 could
advance the main heat release by 18 crank angle degrees (CAD).
They also found that adding O
3 was more effective than the addi-
tion of OH radicals, and was as effective as injection of atomic oxy-

as a way to enhance ignition in a Premixed Charge Compression
Ignition (PCCI) natural-gas engine. Besides natural gas, other fuels
were also investigated using ozone as a potential ignition timing
control agent. Yamada et al. [142] explored the effect of different
additives on the ignition timing of an HCCI engine with dimethyl

the  first  measurement  of  ozone  decomposition  flame  speed  us-

served flame speed was then converted into normal flame speed
by  assuming  a  hemispheric  flame  front.  Another  technique  used

4.2.2. The effect of ozone addition on flame propagation

The effects of O

3  addition on laminar flames have also drawn
significant  attention.  It  is  not  surprising  that  O
3  addition  could
enhance flame propagation speeds as the addition causes an in-
crease in enthalpy of the combustible mixture. Ehn et al. [50] cal-

Besides their work on ignition in 1989, Nomaguchi and Koda
[138]  also  measured  the  burning  velocity  of  CH
4 /air  at  room
temperature  and  atmospheric  pressure.  Their  data  showed  that
3 addition increased the burning velocity by 5% at sto-
50 0 0 ppm O
ichiometric conditions and that the enhancement of flame speed
was greater at fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions than that at sto-
ichiometric conditions. Ombrello et al. [52,63] studied O
3 addition
on propane (C
8 ) flame propagation speed ( S L ) using lifted lami-
3 addi-
nar flames, in which liftoff height is very sensitive to S L . O
tion was observed to decrease the liftoff height, indicating an in-
crease in S L . When accounting for the kinetic and hydrodynamic
effects, an approximately 4% enhancement of S L at a stoichiomet-
ric condition was reported with 1260 ppm O
3 addition. These ob-
servations were later supported by Halter et al. [153] with simula-
tions and a similar experiment. A more recent study by Wang et al.
[65] using a heat-flux burner showed a 3.5% increase of CH
4 /air
3  addition  at  stoichiomet-
laminar  flame  speed  with  3730 ppm  O
3 .  Generally,  the
ric  conditions,  and  9%  increase  for  70 0 0 ppm  O
enhancement increases with the increase of O
3  concentration, as
shown in Fig. 5 . Sensitivity analysis was performed for cases with
3  addition  and  showed  very  similar  results.  For  a
and  without  O
CH
3  addition  did  not  significantly  change  the
combustion kinetics in the flame, with the primary mechanism be-
ing the release of atomic oxygen in the preheat zone of the flame
to promote early fuel oxidation. The addition of atomic oxygen in
the preheat zone did not alter the reaction pathways of CH
4 . An
O
3 reaction mechanism was also provided in this work [65] , con-
sidering the duplicated and missed reactions in previous works. An
approximately 9% enhancement of S L was reported with 8500 ppm
O

ture by Liang et al. [135] , which was also accomplished using a

3 decomposition and the reaction O

Numerical simulations and kinetics pathway analysis showed that
3 is consumed in the flame preheat zone by primarily two reac-
O
2 + OH. The
tions: O
first reaction provides atomic oxygen, which attacks fuel molecules
and  promotes  radical  production.  In  contrast,  sensitivity  analysis
showed  that  S L  has  a  negative  dependence  [66]  on  the  reaction
2  +  OH.  Elevated  pressure  suppresses  the  dissocia-
O
tion  of  H-containing  species  and  diffusion  of  H  atoms  from  the
flame zone, thus lowering the H atom concentration at elevated
pressure conditions in the preheat zone. As a result, the reaction
3  +  H  =  O
2  +  OH  is  suppressed  and  the  competing  pathway,
O
3 decomposition, became a more dominant pathway at elevated
O
3 decom-
pressure conditions. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 at 1 atm O
position  only  accounts  for  37.5%  of  total  O
3  consumption;  while
at 2 atm, 57.6% of O
3 is consumed by the decomposition reaction.
This trend of increasing contribution of this pathway continues if
the pressure is increased further. A crossover pressure, at which
3  decomposition starts to dominate, was observed with a value
O
of approximately 1.5 atm.

As S L positively depends on O

3 decomposition, which provides
atomic  oxygen,  the  enhancement  of  S L  due  to  O
3  addition  be-
comes  more  significant  at  elevated  pressure,  as  observed  in  the

experimentally  by  conducting  experiments  at  different  pressure
conditions by Gao et al. [154] . They performed further experiments
at cryogenic conditions to suppress the ozonolysis reactions at at-
mospheric pressure. In the experiment, the entire burner system
was cooled to approximately 200 K using liquid N
2  to avoid con-
densation of reactants but assure insignificant ozonolysis reactions
inside the burner. At such temperature conditions, less than 10%
3  was consumed by ozonolysis reactions prior to arriving at
of O
the burner exit. The measured flame speeds with reactant temper-
atures at 200 K with and without O
3 addition are shown in Fig. 7
compared  with  measurements  from  existing  reference  [157]  and
simulation. It can be seen that experiments from both Gao et al.
[64] and Dugger [157] deviated from simulations by approximately
10%–15%. However, the trend from the experiments by Gao et al.
[64] is consistent in that O

If a portion of the O

Sensitivity analysis showed that the extension of extinction strain

extinction strain rate enabled the flame with O

under more turbulent conditions than would be possible without

O
cesses presented by Weng et al. [159] and Ehn et al. [50] were not
identical for laminar flames and turbulent flames. More work is re-
quired to understand the interaction between O

hancement by O
3  addition can be very sensitive to small differ-
ences in the flow field interaction with the flame, the coupling be-
tween kinetics and hydrodynamics changes. In the work by Om-
brello et al. [63] , the change of kinetic and hydrodynamics owing
3  addition was discussed using a laminar lifted jet diffusion
to O
flame. The laminar lifted jet diffusion flame featured a premixed
curved flame head at the base to anchor the jet flame, followed by
a diffusion flame tail. With O
3 addition, the non-uniform enhance-
ment of laminar flame speed with the equivalence ratio induced
an increase in the radius of the triple flame front since the lean
and rich premixed flames were enhanced more. The larger radius
of the flame led to more significant flow redirection upstream of
the flame. Therefore, the local flow velocity at the premixed flame
head decreased and allowed for enhanced lifted flame propagation
speeds. In the work by Pinchak et al. [156] , it was shown that ax-
ial stretch rate affected flame speed enhancement in a nearly one-
dimensional laminar flame from a Hencken burner. This is owing
to the increased flux of H + O
3  reaction at higher flame stretch
rate to provide increased enhancement. These works set the stage
to help explain the more profound effect of O
3 addition under tur-
bulent flow conditions.

4.4. Ozone induced cool flames

Ozone was used to induce the formation of cool flames [160–
164] . Cool flames were observed accidentally more than 100 years
ago [165] . Unlike high-temperature flames, the temperature of cool
flames is generally around or below 10 0 0 K. These types of flames
receive attention since low temperature chemistry, which plays a
key role in cool flames, is relevant to practical problems such as
engine knock and fire safety. However, it is challenging to obtain
stable self-sustained cool flames since the low temperature oxida-
tion reactions have long induction times preventing radical chain
branching [163] . After initiation, the cool flame either quenches or
transits to a hot flame. Therefore, addition of O
3 , which could as-
sist the initiation and branching of radicals, has been proposed as a
method to induce cool flames. Won et al. [163] demonstrated sta-
ble cool flames experimentally using a counterflow burner with O
3
added to the oxidizer side initially. The upper and lower burners

was  diluted  by  N
2  and  heated  to  550 K.  The  mildly  heated  fuel
promoted O
3  decomposition to release atomic oxygen, which in-
duced  the  initial  fuel  oxidation.  The  early  oxidation  allowed  for
subsequent  low  temperature  chain-branching  reactions  and  cool
flames were observed as shown in Fig. 10 (a). Numerical simula-
tions showed that the cool flame extinction limit was substantially
extended by a factor of 3 with 3% (by volume) O
3  addition, sug-
gesting that the low temperature chemistry timescale was signifi-
cantly shortened by adding O
3 [163] . Ozone addition promotes low
temperature oxidation processes by producing atomic oxygen prior
to the reaction zone. Atomic oxygen then reacts with fuel to gen-
erate OH radicals, which are critical to activate low temperature

is clear that the diffusion of O
to low temperature chemistry, such as acetaldehyde (CH
3 CHO) and
2 O, are critical to cool flames. Cool flames become unstable at
CH
high strain rate (defined as the gradient of axial flow velocities ac-
counting for the density difference between the fuel and oxidizer
streams  [163] )  or  high  fuel  dilution  levels.  At  low  strain  rate  or
low fuel dilution levels, normal high-temperature flames were ob-
served instead of cool flames as shown in Fig. 10 (b).

In a work that followed, Ju et al. conducted numerical simula-
tions on premixed dimethyl ether (DME) flames [160] . Three dif-
ferent branches were observed: normal high-temperature flames,
double  flames,  and  cool  flames,  as  shown  in  Fig.  12 .  It  was  ob-
served  that  cool  flames  can  exist  at  the  conditions  beyond  the
flammability of conventional high temperature flames, thus signif-
icantly extending the flammability of the DME mixture. However,
for freely propagating flames at an initial temperature 300 K, only
a normal high temperature flame branch was observed. To observe
cool flames, the temperature of the reactants needed to be raised

creased the flame reactivity more significantly compared to merely
3  kinetically promoted the for-
heating the reactants. Therefore, O
mation of cool flames as O
3 decomposition releases atomic oxygen
in the preheating zone of the cool flame, thus accelerating chain-
branching and stabilizing cool flames at low temperature. Similarly,
for stretched counterflow flames, it was reported that O
3 addition
could extend the range of stretch rates at which cool flames can
exist [160] . Sensitivity analysis of the flame speed to reaction rates
and mass diffusivity was performed, as illustrated in Fig. 13 , which
shows the cool flame is sensitive to typical low temperature re-
actions and diffusivities of intermediate species. However, for high
temperature flames, it is more sensitive to the reactants and prod-
ucts.

The  numerical  prediction  of  the  DME  premixed  cool  flame
activated  by  O
3  addition  was  later  experimentally  demonstrated
by  Reuter  et  al.  [161] .  The  experiment  was  performed  at  atmo-
spheric  pressure  in  a  counterflow  burner  with  13 mm  diameter,
with very lean premixed reactants at 300 K, and the counterflow

temperature flames was exhibited. For example, the location of the

The result is in contrast to normal high-temperature flames where
there is a well-known strong correlation between the flame speed
and equivalence ratio. Difference in flame structure was also ob-
served. CH

the  cool  flame  was  much  broader  than  that  of  its  normal  high-
temperature flame counterpart, as compared in Fig. 14 .

3 activated DME pre-
mixed  cool  flames  using  a  Hencken  burner  at  sub-atmospheric
pressures.  Such  a  platform  has  been  used  to  study  freely  prop-
agating  flames  [166] ,  and  was  used  to  measure  the  propagation
speeds of cool flames [162] . Consistent with previous work [161] ,
the flame speed was found to be insensitive to equivalence ratio at
very lean conditions. However, it was also reported that the propa-
gation speed decreases as the equivalence ratio increases from 0.6
to 1.4, shown in Fig. 15 . The peak flame temperatures decreased as
equivalence ratio increased in the reported range, which is in stark
contrast to normal high-temperature flames.

As  a  continuation  of  the  previous  work  [161] ,  Reuter  et  al.
[164] investigated cool diffusion flames for large n -alkanes. As the
3 slightly complicates the chemical kinetics, they gen-
presence of O
3  generator
erated  “ozone-less” cool  flames  by  turning  off the  O
after  cool  flames  were  established.  Without  O
3 ,  the  cool  flames
were much dimmer in terms of the chemiluminescence intensity,
as shown in Fig. 16 , but remained self-sustained. “Ozone-less” cool
flames were generated using this method for large n -alkanes rang-
ing  from  n -heptane  to  n -tetradecane.  Similar  to  previous  work,
the  cool  flames  showed  different  behavior  compared  to  normal
high-temperature  flames.  It  was  found  that  the  chain  length  of
n -alkanes significantly affected the ozone-less cool flame reactiv-
ity. Given the same fuel mole fraction, the extinction strain rate of

ozone-less cool flames increases significantly with the chain length
of n -alkane. In contrast, the extinction strain rates of normal high-
temperature flames were not very sensitive to the chain length of
n -alkane  molecules.  However,  for  the  case  with  O
3 ,  as  the  low-
temperature reactivity was significantly promoted, the reactivity of
the cool flames could be essentially independent of the size of n -
alkane molecules.

4.5. The effect of ozone on combustion through ozonolysis reactions

While  the  majority  of  fuel  oxidation  reactions  require  high-
temperature  conditions,  those  involving O
3  and  alkenes  (ozonol-
ysis), occur very rapidly at low temperature conditions, e.g., 300 K,
as  indicated  by  the  reaction  rate  constants  in  Table  1 .  The  sub-
sequent radical production and heat release could induce in situ
fuel  reforming,  or  even  autoignition  in  a  fuel/air  mixture.  It  is
anticipated  that  ozonolysis  could  significantly  enhance  combus-
tion processes. For mixtures containing O
3  and alkenes, ozonoly-
sis is dominant at low temperature conditions (approximately be-
3 decomposition is only important at higher tem-
low 700 K) and O
perature. A simulation of autoignition in a closed constant pres-
sure  homogeneous  reactor  at  1  atm  was  performed  by  the  au-
thors  of  this  paper  and  is  shown  in  Fig.  17  for  a  mixture  of

tively slow. The effects of ozonolysis become less significant as ini-
tial temperature increases. As shown in Fig. 17 , the simulation re-
sults using the models with and without ozonolysis (red and blue,
respectively)  gradually  converge  as  initial  temperature  increases.
These simulation results imply that, at low temperature, ozonol-
3  consumption pathway
ysis of alkenes becomes the dominant O
and can significantly promote the combustion to the extent that
O
3 decomposition cannot achieve. At temperatures above approxi-
mately 800 K, the effect of ozonolysis reactions becomes negligible
as O
3 decomposition becomes very fast. Regardless, the simulation
3 can dramatically change the autoignition de-
results show that O
lays at any temperatures. As shown in the simulation, autoignition
can be easily activated by ozonolysis reactions even at room tem-
perature conditions. Following this idea, ozonolysis reactions have
been  proposed  as  a  new  way  to  enhance  combustion  processes
[168–172] .

were observed [168–172] . In those studies, non-premixed burners
were used to avoid the heat released from ozonolysis being lost to
the ambient as the time scale of ozonolysis reactions is in the or-
der of milliseconds. An experimental setup used in these studies
is shown in Fig. 18 . To minimize the fluctuation of O
3 concentra-
tion, a mixing buffer was added between the O
3  generators and
3  monitor. During the experiment, initially the oxidizer and
the O
3 generators were turned on, but the fuel stream was turned off.

When the generation of O
3 reached steady state, fuel was suddenly
turned on, and autoignition may occur, which was recorded by a
high-frame-rate camera.

[178] . A simulation conducted using a PLUG flow reactor [179] with
a sub-mechanism of OH ∗, CH ∗, and CO
∗ [180,181] shows that at
2
the experimentally interrogated condition the mole fraction of CH ∗
is  less  than  10 −18  so  its  effect  is  negligible  before  hot  ignition.
Thus, the authors of Ref. [172] presume the filtered chemilumines-

2 ms where relatively weak chemiluminescence from CH
sumed emitter) and strong emission from the ignition kernel from
CH ∗ were observed. At highly diluted conditions without a flame,
gas chromatography (Inficon Fusion μGC) sampling confirmed the
existence of CH
2 , which are products of ozonolysis
reactions. Although OH could be produced directly from ozonolysis
reactions, its chemiluminescence was not observed probably due to
its extreme low concentration at low temperature conditions. The
findings implied that autoignition occurred in such a sequence: ox-
idizer and fuel were mixed in the shear layer; at the same time,
ozonolysis reactions occurred and induced heat release and forma-

fect of reactive species and heat production from ozonolysis and
its subsequent reactions.

trated using simulations in a PLUG flow reactor, and the results are
shown in Fig. 20 . The kinetic model used in this simulation is the

same as the one used to produce the results in Fig. 17 . Simula-
tion results show that autoignition is a two-stage process. Start-
ing  from  the  inlet  of  the  reactor,  temperature  starts  to  increase
gradually  owing  to  ozonolysis  reactions  and  induced  subsequent
reactions.  At  approximately  5.5 cm  downstream,  the  temperature
reaches a plateau at approximately 800 K. In the meantime, both
4  concentrations continue to decrease (from the inlet
O
of the reactor) due to the production of CH
2 O and other ozonolysis
products. Once O
3 is consumed, ozonolysis reactions cease and the
temperature reaches a plateau. Because the dominant product from
ozonolysis reactions, CH
2 O, is relatively stable at this temperature,
reactions slow and the temperature does not change substantially.
Following the temperature plateau, complete combustion occurs. It
was  observed  that  ozone  decomposition  only  starts  to  dominate
when the temperature is above 800 K. It is worth noting that the
reaction O
2  also plays an important role for O
3
consumption. If ozonolysis reactions are turned off in the simula-
tion, no intermediate temperatures or CH
2 O can be observed; O
3
decomposition only occurred in the preheat zone very close to the
reaction zone. The results of the simulation also indicate that be-
fore hot ignition occurred and in a region away from the reaction
zone, ozonolysis is the dominant O
3 consumption pathway and is
responsible for the induced autoignition phenomenon. The inter-
mediate products and temperature are listed in Table 2 , together
with the corresponding simulated burning velocities. Besides heat
released  from  ozonolysis  reactions,  reactive  species  and  radicals
are produced, supporting the claim that ozonolysis reactions en-
hance the combustion via kinetic effects.

To  better  understand  the  experiment,  a  3D  FLUENT  transient
simulation was also conducted. The kinetic model employed in this
3 mech-
simulation was USC Mech II [167] combined with a sub-O
anism [65] including simplified ozonolysis reactions [64] , as pre-
sented in the Supplementary Material. The simulation was able to
predict similar transient phenomena observed in the experiment.
As illustrated in Fig. 21 , at t = 0, the maximum temperature was
2 O region
only 831 K with incoming reactants at 300 K and a CH
downstream was formed with peak mole fraction of ∼3%. Approxi-
mately 2 ms later, a small elevated temperature region was formed
inside the CH
2 O region and the maximum temperature increased
to 2068 K, indicating the formation of a hot ignition kernel. The ac-
2 O before autoignition upstream of the localized
cumulation of CH
elevated temperature region was consistent with the experimen-
tally observed process shown in Fig. 19 .

With  such  an  autoignitive  environment,  flame  propagation
showed different characteristics. Based on simulation results and
experimental observations, the authors [172] proposed an expla-

nation for the flame stabilization and propagation mechanism cor-
respondingly. Fuel was “preprocessed” in situ owing to ozonolysis
reactions  upstream  of  the  flame  front,  which  released  heat  and
produced  reactive  species.  For  large  hydrocarbon  molecules,  the
transport properties were also modified. Therefore, the reactivity
of the fuel-oxidizer mixture increased, and the flame propagation
speed was significantly increased. During the interval of t = 2.0–
3.6 ms in Fig. 19 , the front of the reaction zone propagated approx-
imately  1.8 cm,  corresponding  to  a  very  high  propagation  speed
( ∼11 m/s) relative to the burner. For comparison, the laminar flame
0 = 300 K without
speed calculated by PREMIX [182] is 2.0 m/s at T
including  ozonolysis  reactions  in  the  kinetic  model.  An  extreme
event of fuel preprocessing is an autoignition kernel formed up-
stream of an existing combustion zone. One example is given in
Fig. 22 . At t = 0, the first detectable autoignition kernel (Kernel-1)
was generated at approximately 11.5 cm downstream of the burner
exit. For a time 0.25 ms later, a second autoignition event (Kernel-
2)  was  generated  upstream  of  Kernel-1.  Both  kernels  started  to
grow and finally merged. The authors also noticed that once the
flame propagated to the lower boundary of the CH
2 O zone (below
which CH
2 O concentration was negligible), the propagation speed
of the flame was significantly reduced. The result indicated that
the abnormally high flame propagation speed was a result of high
CH

2 O concentration and elevated temperature.
The autoignitive environment also allows for the interaction be-
tween autoignition kernels and the flame front. Gao et al. [184] ob-
served the oscillation of the flame front due to the formation and
blow-out of the autoignition kernel upstream of the flame front.
Fig.  23  (broadband  line-of-sight  chemiluminescence)  showed  an
example of this process. As shown in Fig. 23 (a)–(d), autoignition
kernels formed upstream of the main flame front. This effectively
decreased the lift off height from 2.55 cm in Fig. 23 (a) to 1.21 cm in
Fig. 23 (f). However, the new flame front formed by the autoignition
kernels failed to propagate downstream further owing to the large
jet velocity and decreased radical concentrations and temperature
owing to the decreased level of ozonolysis closer to the nozzle exit:
once the kernels extinguished, as shown in Fig. 23 (f)–(j), and the
liftoff height of the flame returned to a similar level as Fig. 23 (a).
The results discussed above illustrate that it is possible to modify
the flame propagation and stabilization mechanism using the au-
toignitive environment created using rapid exothermic ozonolysis
reactions.

5.1. Treatment of solid fuels

Ozone  treatment  for  coal  desulfurization  was  attempted  by
2 )
Steinberg et al. [67] . In their work, enrichment of the sulfur (SO
in the effluent gas was detected after O
3  treatment of solid coal
in a glass tube, indicating the possibility of desulfurization. It was
reported  that  the  organic  sulfur  was  harder  to  remove  than  the
pyritic  sulfur.  A  sulfur  balance  for  the  reaction  system  indicated
that the sulfur content of the coal sample was reduced by approx-
imately 0.1–1.3%. The authors concluded that such sulfur enrich-
ment could not indicate a practical desulfurization process unless
the enrichment can be significantly increased. No further discus-
sion on the kinetic process was presented.

lignite was compared with those treated by air or helium at 100 °C.
Chemical analysis indicated the incorporation of oxygen into the
organic matter of lignite during ozonization. The authors suspected
that the oxygen might be attributed to simple and complex ethers
and oxygen heterocycles. It was also found that the oxygen in car-
bonyl  groups  ( > C = O,  –COOH)  increased  while  the  concentration
of hydroxyl groups was reduced after ozone treatment. Ozoniza-
tion also resulted in loosening of the overall molecular structure
of  lignite  based  on  results  from  X-ray  diffraction  measurement.
Ozonized lignite was also reported to have higher reactivity in hy-
drogenation processes in the presence of hydrogen–donor solvents

organic matter (COM) by O
3 . Redistribution of atomic oxygen in
the  functional  groups  was  detected  after  ozonization  because  of
changes  in  the  macromolecular  organization.  Covalent  bonds  in-
side large macromolecular fragments are destroyed by ozonolysis
reactions, which in turn decreased the asphaltenes under thermal
liquefaction and increased the low weight compound yields. One
important kinetic effect is the decreased effective activation energy
of thermal liquefaction after O
3 treatment, as shown in Fig. 24 . It
was shown that C –O bonds were formed in the COM structure of
ozonized coals. These bonds have a lower dissociation energy value

than C –C bonds, which explained the decreased effective activation
energy.

5.2. Treatment of liquid fuels

Ozone has also been applied to treat renewable fuels. The crys-
tallization of saturated fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) during cold
weather  seasons  can  cause  fuel  starvation  and  operability  prob-
lems.  For  this  reason,  the  pour  point  needs  to  be  depressed  for
neat  biodiesel  derived  from  vegetable  oils.  Ozone  was  investi-
gated as a pour point depressant by Soriano et al. [189] . In their
work, ozonized vegetable oil was prepared by bubbling an O
3 /O
2
mixture  into  vegetable  oil.  Ozonized  vegetable  oils  (1%–1.5%  by
weight) were reported to be effective in reducing the pour point
of  biodiesel  prepared  from  sunflower  oil,  soybean  oil  and  rape-
seed oil to −24, −12 and −30 °C, respectively. The effect is due
to  the  ozonolysis  reaction  of  alkenes  in  vegetable  oil  with  for-
mation  of  1,2,4-trioxolane  polar  rings.  The  polar  groups  are  the

typical molecular structure of pour point depressants for conven-
tional diesel, which act on the growing sites of the crystals during
cooling. Complete solidification of sunflower oil biodiesel was con-
ducted. Treatment with 1% ozonized vegetable oils minimized the
solidification. Microscopic analysis revealed that neat sunflower oil
biodiesel fused together into large irregular-shaped agglomerates
after subjecting it to temperatures of 3 °C for 20 min as shown in
Fig. 25 . However, the ozonized sunflower oil impeded the agglom-
eration, giving smaller crystals with sizes of approximately 10 μm
which maintained the fluid flow properties and improved the pour
point of biodiesel.

Ozone  treatment  has  also  been  investigated  to  modify  fuel
reactivity  adaptively  to  control  ignition  timing.  Schönborn  et  al.
[68] demonstrated a method to control ignition timing under HCCI
combustion  conditions  by  modifying  the  molecular  structure  of
the  fuel  using  ozone.  The  result  was  achieved  by  bubbling  air
3  (4% by volume) through a variable proportion
that contained O
of the fuel (1,1-Diethoxyethane) prior to injecting into the engine

treated fuel were identified, which indicates the complexity of the
underlying chemical reactions.

6. Emission control using ozone

sion of Elsevier.)

(single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine). The bubbling pro-
cess  lasted  approximately  4  h  at  293 K  and  1  atm.  The  contact
of fuel with ozone resulted in partial oxidation of the fuel. Even
though  the  change  of  fuel  composition  was  not  clear,  elemental
analysis  carried  out  before  and  after  O
3  treatment  suggested  an
increase in oxygen content occurred during the oxidation of the
fuel  with  O
3 .  The  authors  suspected  that  the  reactions  between
3 -containing air converted a portion of the fuel to per-
fuel and O
oxide (e.g., 1-ethoxy-1-(ethylperoxy)ethane) based on nuclear mag-
netic resonance (NMR) spectra and standard iodometric titration
analysis. The hydroperoxides in the fuel induced by reactions with
ozone could promote autoignition through decomposition to pro-
duce OH. It was shown that as the proportion of oxidized fuel in-
creased, the ignition timing was advanced more in the engine test.
As a continuation of the work, Schönborn et al. [60] further investi-
gated the possibility of controlling the ignition timing with another
fuel, 1-hexene, by altering its molecular structure using prior reac-
3 . NMR was used to analyze the fuel before and after its
tion with O
3 . Several oxygenated products were identified in
reaction with O
the fuel treated by O
3 , which resulted in the formation of ozonide
molecules with a peroxidic structure. Correspondingly, an engine
system utilizing such “smart fuel” was proposed. A portion of fuel
was pre-processed by O
3 and then mixed with the non-processed
fuel. The ignition timing was therefore advanced, likely due to the
early decomposition of peroxidic molecules (1-hydroperoxyhexane)
owing to the O
3 /fuel reaction, as suspected by the authors. There-
fore,  the  ignition  timing  could  be  controlled  via  the  fuel  mix-
ture composition. Still, no definite composition changes of ozone

by a commercial ozonizer was introduced through the inlet port.
In the case without combustion, the authors measured the con-
centration of O

change in concentration was found. The result indicated that the

on ignition (decrease ignition delay and increase cetane number)
were observed with ozone addition. With O

trations of CO and unburned hydrocarbons decreased with the in-
3  concentration. Regarding NO x , the emission slightly

7. Challenge and future research

While many investigations have contributed significantly to an
understanding  of  ozone  related  reactions,  inconsistency  remains,
which is hampering accurate kinetic modeling of O
3 assisted com-
bustion.  Previous  studies  suggest  that  several  kinetic  pathways
may exist in parallel, including direct reactions with fuel (ozonoly-
sis), as well as with intermediate/radical species. However, it is still
3 reaction path-
not clear how and to what extent the different O
ways affect combustion processes. It is possible that such effects
are  dependent  on  local  conditions,  including  temperature,  pres-
sure, and chemical composition. Therefore, a systematic study con-
ducted over a wide range of operating conditions relevant to prac-
tical combustion systems is needed. Furthermore, ozonolysis reac-

Ozone can be economically produced at a large scale and in sig-
nificant quantities at elevated pressure conditions which is benefi-
cial to combustion systems. In most experiments, ozone was pro-
duced by commercial ozone generators typically based on corona
discharge  which  used  pure  oxygen  as  a  working  fluid.  For  most
practical applications, air has to be the working fluid, which poses
challenges on ozone production and lifetime for transport owing
to  the  existence  of  nitrogen  and  water  vapor  in  air.  More  stud-
ies are needed to optimize ozone generation using different exci-
tation means and under different flow conditions. For example, if
the ozone generator is based on absorption of UV radiation, selec-
tive wavelengths could be used for optimizing production. If the
ozone generator is based on an electrical discharge, optimizing the
reduced electric field of the discharge can potentially maximize the
production of select products like ozone [193] .

8. Conclusion

With our increasingly growing appetite for creative energy con-
version  means  by  pushing  the  limits  of  traditional  combustion
processes, O
3  has drawn significant attention as a means to en-
hance  and  control  combustion/ignition  processes.  Compared  to
other  combustion  enhancement  techniques,  potential  advantages
3 addition are that it can be efficiently and economically gen-
of O
erated at elevated pressures and it has a relatively long lifetime to
be transported. Significant advancements in ozone assisted com-
bustion  have  been  made  in  the  past  decade,  where  it  has  been
shown to process fuels, control emissions, and enhance ignition,
flame propagation, and improve flame stabilization.

Ozone decomposition at relatively low temperature is responsi-
ble for the majority of combustion enhancements achieved with
O
3  addition.  Such  reactions  release  reactive  atomic  oxygen  and
accelerate the chain branching process. However, in the reaction
zone of flames, where a radical pool has already been established,
3  decomposition may not affect the combustion process signifi-
O
cantly. For example, every ∼10 0 0 ppm O
3 addition could enhance a
4 /air laminar flame propagation rate by approximately 1%, while
CH
the autoignition delay of a CH
4 /air mixture could be dramatically
shortened (by several orders of magnitude) with the same quantity
of O
3 addition. Another potential mechanism to enhance and con-
trol combustion processes is via low-temperature reactions related
to O
3 , such as ozonolysis. Such reactions could initiate fuel oxida-
tion/dissociation far upstream of the flame or combustion zone to
change the molecular structures (compositions) of reactants. It can
potentially change both kinetic and transport properties of the re-
actants, therefore affecting flame/ignition characteristics. However,
large  knowledge  gaps  remain  with  regard  to  a  fundamental  un-
3  assisted combustion, especially when ozonoly-
derstanding of O
sis reactions are the dominant pathways. The detailed pathways of

22

ozonolysis reactions remain unclear, which brings large uncertainty
in simulation and the interpretation of the kinetic effects. Further-
more, the available studies focus on small molecule fuels and re-
search using real fuels are limited. It is not clear if or how the con-
3 addition is applied to, for example, liquid
clusions change when O
fuels. With the potential for many pathways for O
3 to couple into
the kinetics of combustion systems, there is a future full of pos-
sibilities, from simple burners to high-speed air-breathing propul-
sion systems.

Mr. Bin Wu received his B.E. degree from University of
Science and Technology of China in 2014, and is currently
a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. He
has been working on the ozone-assisted combustion since
2016, focusing on ozone related chemistry.

Timothy Ombrello earned his Ph.D. in Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University in 2009
where he worked towards developing an understanding
of the kinetic effects of long lifetime plasma-produced
species. Upon completing his graduate degree, he went
on  to  work  at  the  Air  Force  Research  Laboratory,  ini-
tially as a National Research Council Research Associate
for one year before joining civil service as a Research
Aerospace Engineer in the Aerospace Systems Directorate.
He  works  predominately  on  research  related  to  high-
speed air-breathing propulsions systems, specifically su-
personic combustion ramjets, covering a range of fluid dy-
namic, combustion, and diagnostic challenges. His inter-
ests lie in performing research and crafting techniques to enhance reactivity for
more rapid ignition and more robust flame propagation and stabilization, from fun-
damental bench-top to supersonic wind tunnel experiments. For his contributions
thus far, he has been given the Early Career Award from the Air Force Research
Laboratory, and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers
(PECASE) from the White House.
